PRIZE ESSAY WRITER
Phillip Little, of Hamilton Town
ship Wins Free Trip to the Iowa
State Fair This Year.
The report of the judges on the
Boy's Prize Essay Contest, is now in
the hands of the county chairman,
Mabel Horner. The first prize is
awarded to Philip Little, of Hamil
ton township, wth Frank Matteson,
of Burrell, and Arthur Sipherd, of
Grand River, close seconds. The sub
ject 011 which the boys wrote this
year was "How Good Roads Benefit
the Farmer." The prize is a trip to
the State Fair. A number of very
excellent essays were written on the
general subject of "Good Roads,"
which did not conform to the condi
tions of the contest. The judges
in the contest were E. D. Moore, of
Lamoni, C. C. Dye, of Woodland,
and Jas. F. Harvey, of Leon. The
following is the prize essay:

these communities will then have
the same school advantages for their
children as those living in towns
have at the present time.
Considering the benefit of good
roads to a country and its people, we
should remember the advantages of
well built roads for the transporta
tion of troops, munitions and provi
sions in time of war, and their use
as roaus will unite the whole country.
I believe we all agree that we need
better roads, even though we do not
agree as to financing or building
them.
So let us, as the future road build
ers of this state and nation, give the
question our careful study, that we
may be ready to build roads suited
to each locality as to cost, durability
and advantages.
Over Four Inches of Rain.
We had over four inches of rain
the last three days of last week, to
be exact according to the government
gauge kept by Mayor Morris Gardner,
4.21 inches From Friday evening at
6 o'clock until Saturday evening at 6
o'clock, a rainfall of 3.97 inches was
recorded for the twenty-four hours.
That is a pretty heavy rain, and will
do a world of good for pastures and
the hay crop, but it is a little hard
on some of the early planted corn,
especially on the low lands.
We'll Have to Write It In.

Owen Herald Parsons.
Owen Herald Parsons was born in
High Point township, December 6,
1891, died May 16, 1916, aged 24
years, 5 months and 10 days. He
was converted and united with the
M. E. church at High Point in Feb
ruary, 1908. From that time until
his death he has been a faithful
christian ever ready to do any chris
tion work that he was able to do. He
was elected superintendent of the
Sunday school three years ago and
was faithful in his duties as long as
his health permitted him to attend.
He loved the work and often express
ed his regret at not being able to at
tend Sunday school and church ser
vices. He was a young man of clean
habit, industrious and possessed good
judgment. He was always kind in
his association with his friends by
whom he was highly esteemed. He
was one of our model young men and
we all were his friends. Through all
the months of his sickness he bore
his suffering with the true spirit of
christian fortitude. He expressed
himself as desiring very much to live
but said that if God had work for him
in heaven that he could do better
than to live and serve Him here He
was willing to submit to God's will
and was not afraid to go. He leaves
his father, three sisters and three
brothers and many friends to mourn
his death. He will be missed in the
community, the church and especially
in his home for he was very devoted
to his father and to his brothers and
sisters. The family have the sym
pathy of the entire community. The
funeral was conducted from the M. E.
church at High Point Wednesday,
May 17 at 2 o'clock. Interment in
the Woodland-Lentz cemetery west
of Woodland where his mother's body
lies. Rev. J. G. Duling, his pastor,
conducted the services.

Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, at
tlie pleasant home of the bride's par
ents, Miss Irene Hutchinson and
Floyd Coder were united in the
bonds of matrimony. The ceremony
took place in the presence of the im
mediate relatives of the bride and
groom. Rev. Raoul R. Moser, pas
tor of the Methodist Episcopal
church, was the officiating clergyman.
The ring ceremony was used in pro
nouncing them man and wife. Fol
lowing congratulations an elaborate
wedding breakfast was served.
The bride was becomingly attired
in a beautiful dress of light silk. She'
carried bride's roses and lillies of
the valley. The groom Avore a suit
of dark blue.
The bride is a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. E. L. Hutchinson. She is a
gifted and accomplished young wom
an who has endeared herself to many
friends since making her home in
Leon. The groom is the son of Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Coder. He was bora
and raised in Leon and highly es
teemed by all who know him.

their friends after June 1st.
Mr. and Mrs. Coder have the best
wishes of their many friends in Leon
and vicinity for their future success

Observed Mother's Day.
Leon, with nearly every other city
of the United States, paid homage to
mother's Sunday—Mother's Day, last
Sunday, and many wore carnations
in honor of mother, white for the
dead and red for the living.
"Mother's Day" was originated by
the late Miss Anna Jarvis of Phila
delphia, in 1907. Miss Jarvis had in
vited a friend to spend the second
Sunday in May with her, to commem
orate the date of her mother's birth
day.
On this date Miss Jarvis announc
ed her plan for a national observance
of "Mother's Day. The next year
Miss Jarvis' propaganda had pro
gressed so far that Philadelphia cele
brated the day in church and home,
although Miss Jarvis, when the day
arrived, was too ill to participate in
the celebration.
She had written thousands of let
ters to prominent men, ministers,
eaucators and business men. She had
said little about it, however, and her
friends who did not realize the extent
of her work were surprised at the
wide observance of the first Mother's
Day.
For Miss Jarvis had prevailed on
Senator Burkett of Nebraska to in
troduce a resolution suggesting that
the second Sunday in May be creat
ed a holiday in honor of mothers,
and although other senators derided
Senator Burkett when he spoke on
the subject, the wires carried the
news and many newspapers editorial
lv praised the plan.
Since then governors of many
states have issued proclamations ask
ing their citizens to observe the day,
and it has become a national day of
praise to mother.
The white carnation was chosen as
the flower for Mother's Day, Miss
Jarvis said, because it grows in every
part of the country and can readily
be procured in early May.
Two Suffrage Questions.
We have heard a couple of ques
tions in regard to the suffrage ques
tion discussed the past few days and
we have looked up the matter and are
prepared to answer them. The first,
does it require a two-thirds vote or a
majority vote to carry the proposi
tion. The answer is that a majority
of the votes is all that is required.
The second was whether in case suf
frage carried the ladies would vote
at the general election this fall, ana
the answer is they will be entitled to
vote, if the suffrage amendment car
ries pt the primary election in June.
