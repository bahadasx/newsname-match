INJURIES SU STAI IJ ED III RUII'I
Mrs. Thomas J. Lynch was sudden-1
ly called to Oakland this morning by
a. telegram announcing the death of
Thomas E. Edwards, her father at
Fabiola hospital in Oakland. Death
was due to Injuries sustained In a
runaway accident that occurred last
Sunday near St. Helena, California.
First advices stated the patient was
improving but on Tuesday he gave
signs of failing but even then the
symptoms were not of a nature to
cause 'any alarm and when death
came at an early hour this morning
it was wholly unexpected,
Mr. Edwards was 58 years of age,
born and reared in Nevada where he
amassed a fortune In mining and mer
chandising and was regarded as a
man of unusually sound judgment. He
always relied on his own estimate of
business matters and to this remark
able concentration he ascribed his
success. In the early days he kept
a store in Taylor and Pioiche and
later was an active promoter in the
vicinity of Delamar wnere he loca
ted the April Fool. Coming to Tono
pah in 1901 he at once pronounced
this camp the best he had Been and
predicted that it would be one of the
great producers of the country. Soon
after arrival he bought the lot now
occupied by f the .Toggery on Main
street for $500 and embarked in the
grocery business. When the Gold-
field boom broke out he went over to
i hat town and was one of the locators
of the Vinegorone fraction which
turned out one of the richest pieces of

the Montgomery-Shoshone and stak
ed Bob Montgomery In that property.
When ore was opened the miner who
brought the good news, from under
ground was rewarded with a gift of
$10,000 cash. Mr. Edwards sold his
halt interest for $100,000 cash and '
soon aft4r converted his mining hold
ings into cash and went down to the
coast with a fortune that was estlma-
ted at $200,000. This money was in
vested In real estate in San Francis
co and Oakland and has more than
doubled in value.
The only information the family has
of the accident is a letter from one
of the daughters stating that her
father had gone to St. Helena with
a friend to inspect some mining
claims. On the return trip the hor
ses ran away. Mr. Edwards was driv
ing and succeeded in keeping the team
in the road for over a mile until th
road took a sharp turn when both
occupants of the buggy were thrown
out. Mr. Edwards suffered a fractur
ed arm and terrible bruises and re
mained without medical attention all
Sunday night at a country hotel until
his family heard of the accident and
removed him to the hospital in Oak
land. Deceased was a widower, his wlfa
having died In 1907. The other mem
bers of his family are Mrs. Thomas
J. Lynch, Mrs. Elmer S. Church, Miss
Gertrude Edwards of Oakland and Ed
ward J. Roberts bf Salt Lake. Four
sisters and a brother also live in Oak
land. PLEASED WITH PROPERTIES
H. C. Brougher. president of the

two workings. He says heavier work
is contemplated In both estates. The
west drift in the Midway on the eight
hundred level is progressing on a face
