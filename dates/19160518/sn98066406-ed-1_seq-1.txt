F you are a business man, if you are a pro
fessional man, if you are employed at a
daily wage, make up your mind to deposit
weekly a certain sum of money in tho bank.
You'll be surprised how the sum will grow.
Cash in bank gingera up the man who has
it there. Ho has more confidence in him
gelf. The business man is ready for a dull season. He
is ready for an opportunity.
So is tho professional man. Tho man who is work
ing for a daily wago and who hasn't any money in bank
frequently is fearful of a loss of his situation. He docs
not work as well or with the confidence in himself as
does the man with something laid asiift for a rainy day.

Better Roads for St. Clair County
The County Uoad Commissioners
are to be commended on the good work
done throughout St. Clair county, and
we hear nothing but words of praise
for the better condition of the roads
that come within their Jurisdiction.
Commissioner Stevens was here last
Saturday in conference with Urockway
township officials regarding the build
ing of the mile road west from Tale
this summer. Mr. Stevens informs the
Expositor that the work east of the
city will soon be started. He has now
under his supervision the cutting down
of the hill at Thornton, and twelve
teams are at work moving the dirt.
Between five and six thousand yards
will be moved and placed in the gulley
below, the largest job anywhere in the
county. When completed only a slight
grade will be noticeable. From 1'ort
Huron to this point about thirteen
miles of good roads have already been
built. The work will be continued on
to Yale within the next year or two.
This will make a beautiful drive to
the county seat witti no hills for the
autoist to climb.

Y. H. S. BREAKS EVEN
In Two Bali Games Played During
the Past Week.
In our estimation the game at Hrown
City Ia6t Friday between the High
School teams of Yale and that hustling
little town was a "top-notcher." JVe
won, b'gosh, and we're glad we did.
It makes us happy to think our boys
can go right into the enemy's camp
and win, even after such a diuastrous
drubbing as they received at the hands
TOOAry
Beadle Had 'Em Guessing
of the detachment from another little
burg up In Sanilac county only a week
or two previous. This change In the
playing tactics of our team shows that
without question our new principal is
"long" on coaching, and knows how to
inject "pep" Into the bunch.
The game was a good one all the
way through, and both teams played
real base ball. There were many star
plays scattered throughout the contest
and those who attended liked the show.
To.tt
"Jim" Nailed 'Em On First
The final count gave the victory to our
team in a rive to one score.
In view of the fact that Yale won, a
perplexing question has arisen which
we would like to have some of the high
school pupils answer. To the one
sending in a satisfactory answer we
will give a lie package of "Wrlgley's

Died at the hospital in Detroit at
2:30 a. m. ou May 14, 1916, Vera, wife
of W. N. Harvie, of Detroit. Cause of
death was sent I c peritonitis.
Vera May (lough was born in Yale
October 29, 1894, and was the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. George (lough. She
would have been twenty-two years of
age next October.
She was married to W. N. Harvie on
January 12, 1915, and the home was
made In Detroit, where a son was born
to them on May 2nd. The child is
living and will be cared for by rela
tives.
The funeral services were held on
Tuesday at the M. P. church in Y'ale,
llev. W. c. iiarger, or Detroit, omciai
ing, and the body laid in Elmwood
cemetery.
The sympathy of the community is
with the bereaved family.
I desire to thank the many friends
who rendered assistance during the
illness of my beloved wife, and for the
sympathy shown after her death, also
the choir for their services at the funer
al and for the beautiful floral offer
ings. Sincerely,
W. N. Harvie
Thomas II. Hebner died at his home
at Portland, Ore., April 27th, 1916.
Deceased was born at Jeddo, Mich.,
in September, 1852, and resided in Y'ale
and adjacent territory until 1900, when
he moved to Millersburg, Mich., where
he resided for several years, then mov
ing to Alpena, and from there to Port
land, Ore., in July, 1910.
He is survived by a widow, Mrs.
Catherine Hebner, two daughters, Mrs.
Nellie E. McLeod, Mrs. Kose M. Ben
nett and one son, Edwin J. Hebner,
all of whom reside at Portland.
He was injured In a mill about three
years ago, from which Id jury he never
recovered.
Mrs. W. I. Tillotson died at the home
of her daughter, Mrs. Gillam at Niles
on Saturday, May 15, 1916, after only a
short illness. Dr. and Mrs. V. A. Lacy
attended the funeral.
Criminal Carelessness.
In noting the three cases of scarlet
fever in our little city, which were un
doubtedly contracted, unknowingly, in
Port Huron, we venture to say that
Port Huron has even more to answer
for than the careless exposure of this
dreaded and dreadful disease to its own
inhabitants.
In reading the extract of a sermon
preached by llev. John Munday, pastor
of the Grace Episcopal church, In the
editorial column of Tuesday's Times
Herald, we liud a strong statement
made in regard to the criminal indiff
erence of Port Huron parents and
guardians to this disease and the bu
premo carelessness with which these
people, with convalescing children or
those with mild cases, are allowing
them to mingle with others or attend
school.
The endeavors of the city health au
thorities are frustrated right and left
by these same foolish and seltish par
ents. The period of convalescence in
scarlet fever is the most dangerous and
from the lightest of cases, another may
take the most virulent form.
So far as we have heard, the three
cases here are all light, and are in fam
ilies who are certain to take strictest
precaution in every possible way, and
yet there is no telling how many more
have been exposed in the same way as
these, by the neglect and carelessness
and indifference of others.
Farm Residence Burned
The farm residence, one mile east of
Yale owned by F. O. Putney, and oc
cupied by Hay Seaton aud family was
burned to the ground on Wednesday.
The tire is supposed to have caught
from a defective chimney, and before
assistance could reach the scene the
entire building was in flames. Only a
part of the household goods were saved.
Mr. Seaton was away at the time. The
loss on the dwelling amounted to $1200
with $500 insurance.
Mr. Putney has workmen engaged
Eutting up a temporary building to
ouse the family of Mr. Seaton who is
employed working the farm.
