in conversion with Mrs. It. L.
Fenwick. Little Virginia ran on
ahead into tho house and was
ovidently trying to warm her
lianda at tho erato when her
dress caught flro and in a mom
ont was in flames. T. 0. Jr.,
saw tho reflection 'of the Are
through a window, and thinkiflji
his sister had a newspaper in the
grate, ran in to prevent her from
playing in the flro and found
lier-clothing a mass of flumes.
Ho then ran for a nan of water
and fioured it on his sister ex
tinguishing the flame'. By this
, timo Mrs. Hart came in the
room but the little one was to
badly burned it was impossible
to donapything for her.
Everything possiblo was done
thafcould be. Dr. Sink was hur

with blessings to her parents that
she seemed a flower of paradise
permitted to bloom for a brief
season by their side and then re
called for some good purpose
to her Ileaveuly home, whon

World camo to claim this dainty
darling as his own.
Whon we eco a precious bloaanm '

Rudely taken from our bnnnrn
How our aching hearts deitlit
Hound her llttla grave wo linger,
Till the letting sun U low;
Feeling all our hope lia e perished
With the babo wo cborUhud so.
Virginia sleeps, but not forever,
There will be a glorloui dawr.
And we shall meet to pat t no, imvur,
On the roiurrectton morn.

EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION
i
Calls Forth the -Following Statement to Newspaper
Readers
TO TflE NEWSPAPER.READERS OF KENTUCKY:
The Executive Committee of the Kentucky Press Association
wishes to bring to the attention of newspaper readers, and the
friends of the press, the seriou situation confronting the publishers
at this time, and point out some facts which we feel should be com
municated to you in our altempt to meet conditions recently thrust
upon us. We do this after much thought on the matter, feeling that
we aie acting for the good of bolii publisher and reader. Doubtless
you have been or will be called upon to pay a" fewj:ents. more on
your jobwork, and in some instances more for your paper and ad
vertising in cases where subscriptions and advertising rates have been
at the minimum.
in the interest of a free press we askyoiito meet the advance
cheerfully.
There may be ample excuse, slight excuse or no excuse to ad
vance the prices on us as they have been advanced, but the fact re
mains that we are paying from BO to 500 per cent, more for our
paper stock, inks, oils, gasoline metal, etc., than we did eight
months ago.
- Paper makers insist lhere must be a cutting down in the demand
upon them; that they are working three shifts a day and that at this
season of the year when they should be accumulating a reserve stock,
they cannot supply the demand'. Large publishers everywhere are
trying to meet the suggestion of the paper makers by the strictest
economy, In which they are cuttjng down lhe size of paper, margins
and granting no return of Unsold papers. Small publishers have
slight opportunity to economize in this manner. The Federal Trade
"Commission is deeply concerned and alarmed but so far seem power
less to suggest feasible or adequate relief methods. Under existing
circumstances few newspapers can continue long without a readjust
ment. Hundreds of the weaker ones have already gone under and
many more are about to suspend.
There is a remedy and it lies in the strictest economy, advance
ment of rates on job work, advertising and subscription. It matters
not how reluctant publishers areata do this, it will have to be done if
they continue in businers, and continue to be useful to their readers
and patrons. -
In conclusion, wccallnaJl persons who believe in the mission
of a free press to co-operate with us in adjusting our business to
these new and unheard of conditions.
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Of the Kentucky Press Association.
P. S. Since the above statement was prepared we note that a
number of press associations have prepared similar statements to the
public.
