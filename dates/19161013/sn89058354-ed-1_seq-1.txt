LOCAL POSTOFF CrSHOK
SPLENDID GAINS PAST YEAR
Indicates That All Lines of
Businesses Improving Over
Same Period Last Year.
Gains Shown, In All Depart
ments.
The first ;three months, or
quarter, as it is better known, ip
the Postoffice fiscal year was up
on September 30, and Postmaster
Y. Q. Caldwell has prepared
some interesting statistics from
his record books which show
that conditions are, improving.
The figures shown below tend to
point out a steady, healthy in
crease which should be . taken as
an indication that all lines of
business,' generally speaking, are
looking better than for some
time. This fact was pointed out
in the last bank statements of
the local banks and is now em
phasized by the postoffice state
ment. It is in part as follows:
In July, 1915, in the postal
department of the local postoffice
showed $983.52 as sale of stamps,
paper etc., against $1007.70 for
July 1916, an increase of $24,18,
or about tt per cent increase.
In August 1915, the sales were
$794.45, against $736.78, in Aug
ust 1916, which is an increase of
$42.33. which is 5 1-3 per cent
increase.,
In September 1915, the sales
$740.56, against $858.28 in Sep
tember 1916, an increase of
$106.72, which is a percentage of
14 1-2 increase..
In the money order depart
ment in July 1915 there were
911 orders issued; in July 1916,
956; an increase of 45, or an in
crease of about 5 per cent. The
paids in July 1915 were 357
against 378 in July 1916; an in
crease of 21 orders or about 6
per cent. The cash involved in
July 1915 was $5440.82 against
$5123.53 in July 1916. . ,
In August 1915 the orders
issued were 802, against 905 the
same .period , this ; year; an in
crease of 103 orders or nearly 13
per cent. , The pids in August
1915 were 336 against 393 in
August 1916, an , increase of 57
orders or nearly 17 per cent.

$6646.71 against $6796.77 in Sep
tember 1916. ;
In the postal savings system
Mr. Caldwell did not give out
any actual figures but it is under
stood that on September 30, 1915,
the deposits amounted to a little
better than $7000.00 while now
they Sre in the neighborhood of
$8000,00 an increase of about
7 1-2 per ' cent When it is
remembered that theso deposits
are often times made up of chil
dren's dimes and other compara
tively small . depositors this is
considered a splendid showing in
this as well as the other depart
ments. -

This firm has been in the exclu

for years and have conducted
successful sales in almost every
portion of the United States. It
is the largest organization of its
kind in this country.
This company employs a unique
selling method, having in their

splendid male quartette and brass
band which furnish entertain
ment for those who attend the
sale.
A band concert will be held on

that a large crowd will be in
attendance at the sale. . .
While unloading, logs one day
this week near Cottage Grove,
Hunt Ross was painfully hurt by
a blow in the face from a scant

was lying loose on the ground,
and the log rolling over it threw
one end'in the air, striking Ross
in the face and inflicting a pain

this city last Tuesday, in the

of the N. C. & St. L. Railway,
Mr. A. D. Knox, Assistant In

talk' to the good audience of
sweet potato growers wno were
in attendance. - He urged organ
ization and co operation, saying
that these were the fundamental
principles of the Association,
and without which the best re
sults could not be obtained.

Division of Extension, Universi
ty of Tennessee then made an il
lustrated talkon the growing of

PARIS COTTON DELIVEPJES
MORE THAN 78,000 POUNDS
AH Products Command Hand
some Prices In the Local
Markets
A spectacle was presented to
the people of Paris last Saturday,
the like of which has never be
fore been seen in this section of
West Tennessee, when farmers
from everv nook and corner of
the county seemed to vie with
each other in marketing their
products.
King Cotton led the van,
78,000 pounds being delivered to 4
the gin in this city on that day.
They came from every section
and the street leading to the gin
was lined on either side for a
block in each direction with
wagons waiting their turn to be
unloaded. Only a faint idea of
the amount of cotton brought to
this city on that date can be
gathered by observing the pic
ture of, the lines of wagons,
which we reproduce in this issue. !
On the above date cotton was
selling at $6.25 per hpndred and .
the deliveries of this staple
netted Henry county farmers
nearly $5,000.00. Up to the
present time more than 500,000
pounds of cotton has been de
livered to the local buyers. This
is about one-fourth of the esti
mated crop in this county. 11,000
pounds was baled at the gin here
last Saturday.
Large quantities of all other
farm products were converted
into cash in the local market
Saturday, including corn, hay, ;
wheat, hogs, cattle, etc., B. F.
Diggs, one of the largest live
stock dealers in Henry county
shipped a large number of cattle
on that day. He has during the
past year handled more than
$100,000 worth of livestock, and
states that prospects have never
been better for a good market
this fall.
All in all, Paris had the aspect
of a big, trading center and busi
ness was unusually good in all
lines.
