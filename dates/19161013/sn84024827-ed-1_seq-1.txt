Declares Thyssen,
(By Review Leased Wire)
HAMBORN ON THE RHINE. Oct
11. (via London, Oct. 12.) That Ger-
many will not take up submarine war- j
fare again in the old or sharpened
form, is the opinion expressed to the
Associated Press by August Thyssen,
the coal and steel magnate, who is in
close touch with the empire's affairs.
Herr Thyssen's assurance came in the
form of an abrupt declaration "Ber
lin will keep its word" uttered at the
conclusion of a discussion of the pres
ent political situation, the new sub
marine activity off the American coast
and the internal German movement
for a sharper attitude toward Great
Britain.
Herr Thyssen referred today to Ger-
many's promise to tbe United States
in the Sussex crisis and his definite
statement may be regarded as having
a double significance because the
Rhitieland is considered to be a hot
bed of agitation for the resumption of
a ruthless submarine campaign and

was shot through the back, it was
said, while running from the scene
of battle and fell dead.
As far as could be learned, none of
the policemen or the militiamen were
hurt. A fireman, however, was shot
and wounded earlier in the day while
attempting to attach a hose to a hy-
drant in an effort to drive away an
unruly crowd.
Reinforced by the militiamen today,
the police took 30 strikers prisoners
and started to raid the saloons which
had defied the order to close. As the
advance guard entered the strike area !
they were met by mishiles from roofs
and doorways. They immediately op
ened lire which was returned by the
strikers and their sympathizers.

a rival in such a contest.
Victory To Best Team
The victory over Brooklyn today
j was so clean cut and decisive that
there was left no ground for argument
