Moro trouble Is expected this after
noon when the strikers try to gt
their pay nt the plant of tho Tide
water Oil Company. As a result of
the rioting of the Inst threo dnye
and nights, In which 'three persons,
one a woman, have been killed, at
least seventy-flvo Injured and scores
arrested, the city officials and officials
ol the company decided It would b?
dangerous to pay the strikers off at
this time.
STRIKERS OPENLY THREATEN
TROUBLE.
Many or the strikers have an
nounced that If tho company attempt
to withhold what Is dui them the
company will have to tnke the con
sequences. Hcvcinl hundred policemen, under
command of Capt. Qrlfflth. and armed
with rifles, went Into the Constable
Hook ruction, tho district where moet
of the disorder has occurred, nnd con
fiscated every weapon they could find.
Htrlkerw wero bnnked up against the
wall und their revolvers taken from
them. .Vh a result of this raid, the
strikers are In a sullen mood.
Muynr Oarvln expressed the opin
ion to-day that tho police force, aug
mented by several hundred cltlteni,
would soon hava the situation under
control.
"Wo'ro not taking any chances,
hownvrr," hJ declared. "We are still
wnnrlni: In pollremon. They are all
prepared to defend themselves In any
emergency, If tho strikers start any
mum noting they will only get the
worst of It.1'

A visit to Police Headquarter
showed clearly what Mayor Qanrla
had In mind when he made the atats
ment. The place looks like an arsenal.
It Is filled with rifles, revolvers, shot
guns and ammunition.
Mayor Oarvln was even so otU
mlstlc as to believe that the pcliM
guard will be strong enough to pets,
mlt tho Standard Oil Company ana
its subsidiaries to resume operation
on Monday. Other city oniclils are
not so confident. They believe that
any attempt to open the oil plants
will result tn more riotlnr. .,
