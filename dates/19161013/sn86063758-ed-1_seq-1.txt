Harrisburg, Pia. Oct. 11.?As a resun
of the conference last night and early
today between President wilson
and Secretary Lansing at Long Branch
N. J., it was stated authoritatively tonight
that no evidence of the reaking
of German promises to the United
States had "been discovered so far in
' with the submarine activi
ties off the American coast but that
the American government would continue
its investigations and would
watch very closely any repetition of
the attacks.
The only direct comment on the
i discussion between the president and
I' the secretary obtainable from official
* ^sources tonight was that every angle
of the submarine situation had been
I discussed and that problems brought

submarines so near the Amen

Administration officials apparently
fear thot difficulties may result if
German submarine warfare is carried
on on a large scale on this side of the

Oyer Submarine Situation
Carefully. Long
Branch, X. .J., Oct. 10.?Presi/iont
"Wiicnn anrl Sprretarv Lansing
discussed in detail at Shadow Lawn
today German submarine attacks on
merchantmen Sunday off the New
England coast. The conference Lasted
until late tonight and. will be continued
tomorrow morning. 1
It was indicated by officials today
that facts so far collected through j
government agencies/ have disclosed
no grounds for drastic action by the
United States government because or
the uttacks themselves. Xo evidence
has been found that international
law was violated by the German sub-1
marines. It was understood, how-1
ever, that the president and Secretary
Lansing discussed the wisdom of j
pointing out to Germany the iijadvis-;
mbility of operating her submarines j
?-xA/v 4-Am'f nrio 1
in Close proxiinuy iu Hie tuiuu.m.
waters of the United States.
'Administration officials took the
position that the transferring of sub- 1
marine warfare so close to America's j
shores was fraught with grave danger!
because of tlie possibility of mist ikes
being made by submarine commanders.
Reports that strong senti-:
ment exists in Germany for the re- j
sumption of submarine warfare on a
broader scale caused some alarm
among officials.
The announcement of Counselor j
Pclk. of the state department inj
Washington today that the United
States will refust to accept the contention
of the entente allies that neu- j
tr. ils should deny the use of their j
harbors to all submarines preceded J
the arrival of Secretary uz-usiug uuc.
Gerard in Picture.
The arriv.il of James W. Gerard,
American ambassador to Berlin, in
New York shortly before Mr. Lansing I
left that city for Shadow Lawn added;
interest to the meeting between the j
president and Mr. Lansing 'because of j
tlie fact that the secretary saw ,vir. i
Gerard at luncheon in Xcvv York.
In discussion of the hubmarines at- ,
tacks Sund. y officials here referred to'
diplomatic correspondence between the j
I'nitcd States and Great Britain, be-!
ginning in 1914, in which the American
government protested against the
patrolling of the American coast out*1
*-?i?oViinc
side the tttree nine nmu uy
This was pointed to as providing a
precedent for protesting agiinst the
proximity of German submarines to
the American coast.
In the correspondence with Great
Britain the United States took the
position that it always had maintained
that patrolling by belligerent cruisers J
in,"close proximity" |o ports of the!
" ii-ith !
United States wijs mtuusisimi .nu.
{he treatment to be expected from the
vessels of a friendly power in time of
war. Great Britain did not admit the
legal correctness of the position of the
United States, but promised to do everything
possible to avoid annoying
American shipping.
While no formal announcement was j
pnnsi^pred nrobable the I
mailt; u vfuu F ?
United States would take a position i
with regard to German submarine |
operations similar to that assumed in
connection with the coast patrol. There
was absolutely no indication that the
president and Secretary Lansing had
any ground for thinking Germany had
violated its promises not to attack
merchantmen without warning and j
nrnvidintr for the safety of |
l? Ii/Iiwut. v
passengers and crews. It w,<s stated,
however, that evidence still was being
collected and that no final decision c:i
this point had been reached.
The secretary came to Long Branca
at 5:40 o clock this afternoon. Pres
ident :\Yfllson was at the station to meet
"him. It was the first time he and
Secretary Lansing had seen each other
since the president left Washington
early in September. They went
immediately to Shadow Lawn. There
was no discussion of the submarine
question until 8 o'clock when diflner
was finished. Then the president and
Secretary Lansing went into the entire
question in detail. It was said they
would confer until so late there was
no possibility of an announcement tonight.
Secretary Lunsing expects to
/eturn to Washington tomorrow.

tonight after his return from his conference
with President Wilson at

| Although the secretary declined to
elaborate on this statement, other officials
indicated that much would depend
on Rear Armiral Knight's report
on all the naval phases of the
raid, particularly steps taken to insure
the safety of passengeVs. There

Lansing has gone to see uie presiueiu

"THE STRONGER LOVE."
On Thunder Mountain lived Nell
Serviss, a wild flower of surpassing
beauty.
| The Servisses were "at feud" with
the Rutherfords, who lived on the other
side of the mountain. Jim Serviss,
a caal, clear-e'yed young mountaineer
was the leader of his clan and between
i
Jim and Nell Serviss was a sort of
mountain 'betrothal, for Jim loved :
i
Nell with all his heart and soul. Tom
i Serviss, his vicious, worthless brother
' also loved Xell and persistently anVitir
with his fl ftpntirtTl
lk\jj yu uvi vvav**
i One day a handsome stringer from
the city, that distant fairyland came *
into this little world and went to live *
with the Rutherfords. A humorous accident
made Nell and the newcomer acquainted.
Each day the stmnger would
m-or flip mountains examining
n auuvi v* V* v^.v ??? ^
the rock and chipping it with a little
hammer. His actions puzzled the
"moonshining" mountainers, who suspected
him of being a "revenooer."
I Xell Serviss and the newcomer bel
came close friends and this friend- x
ship soon grew into something deeper
| and stronger. Leirning of his search
| for radium ore Xell showed the stranger
a rich deposit near the Scrviss
' "moonshine'" still. Shortly afterwards,
on the night of the dance in the schiil
house, the still was burned by the
revenue officers. The newcomer was
suspected and the Servisses started
in the morning to "get" him.
I wn dashed through the forest to
! warn "her?friend?with evil-minded
.
! Tom Serviss in pursuit. But. her
friends, the mountains, punished Tom
in their own fashion and Neil arrived
at -.the Rutherford's cabin in the nick
of time. Rutherford then faced Serviss
and in a sacrifice few women have
ever been called upon to make little
Nell of Thunder Mountr'n humiliated
herself that another migiii be saved
and by so doing triumphed in "THE
STRONGER LOVE'' thnt lifted j
higher than the mountain peaks.
