USTER OPEHS HIS
REFLECTION FIGHT
DENIES ASSESSING EMPLOYES
SAYS BREWERIES FINANCED
M'BRIDE IN 1908.
Declaring that he had not assessed
his appointees SIO,OOO to defray his
campaign expenses in 1912, as fre
quently stated by Republican papers,
and charging that Mcßride's cam
paign for the gubernatorial nomina
tion in 1908 was financed by the
breweries, Governor Lister this week
inaugurated his campaign for re-elec
tion in his usually vigorous style. He
officially opened his campaign Mon
day, when he addressed a large au
dience in the Grand theater at noon,
at a meeting arranged under the
auspices of the Lister campaign com
mittee of King county, acting inde
pendently of the state central com
mittee.
"My opponent says that if elected
to the position of governor he will not
assess' his officials, or those under
him, to pay campaign expenses," the
governor said in that speech. "I de
sire to answer that charge at this par
ticular time. ,1 am going to call the
attention of the people of Seattle to
the campaign that was waged four
years ago.
"My opponent, Governor Hay, whd
was a candidate for election, had ex
pended, according to his own state
ment, during the primary campaign
over |13,000 to secure the primary
nomination, and I received the nomi
nation for the office of governor just
three weeks before election.
"The campaign had to be waged
rapidly and strongly. It was a cam
paign against strong forces and it was
waged that way. The usual methods
that are used in the collection of cam
paign funds were not possible, on ac
count of the short time that we had
to make those collections, and the
money that usually the friends of a
party will give to a campaign was
■mailer, on account of the short time,
than was usual In such a case.
In Debt at the End of Fight.
"Not a single thing was left
undone, however, to bring about suc
cess In that campaign. I worked un
ceasingly night and day. I made up
my mind that I was going to be elect
ed governor of the state of Washing
ton.
"At the close of the campaign 1 was
carrying some Indebtedness that had
been Incurred during the campaign
for compalgn purposes, and had the
business in which I was engaged been
as good as we all hoped it would be
—which was the lumber business —
it would have very quickly been ab
sorbed, but, like every other person
engaged in that line of business In
the state of Washington, it has been
a case of Just keeping things moving;
there was nothing, ever since the
panto of 1907, In the lumber market.
"Ton know the situation as
well as I. And after I had been
In office for some time, some of
those who had been appointed to
office, who knew that I was still
carrying that indebtedness, got
together, raised the money and
paid the campaign Indebted
ness. All of this was done with
out my having any knowledge
regarding it.
"I am going to say this further,
that during the present campaign
those who have official positions in
this admlnstratlon are assisting in
paying campaign expenses, and I am
sure that Is equally true of every
other party In power this year, as It
has been ever since parties existed.
Not Assessing Officeholder*.
"I want to say this In conclu
sion, however; There Is not a
single member of my adminis
tration, be he or she In a posi
tion high or low, to whom any
request or to whom any endeav
or has been made by me person
ally to have them put up a
single nickel, or any other
amount, for campaign expenses;
and if anybody in my adminis
tration does not desire to give
any amount to assist in this cam
paign, they do not have to do it,
and it is not going to jeopardise
their positions one iota. There
has not been collected a single
nickel except of a voluntary char
acter, and there will not be a
nickel collected, while I am in
office, excepting that it Is abso-

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1916.
PLAN FARMER'S INSTITUTE
IN OLYMPIA THIS FALL

WORD SKETCHES OF NON-PARTISAN CANDIDATES
Intimate Glimpses at Those Who Aspire to County Office on
Their Ability Alone, Who Are Mairing Their Campaigns on
Their Individual Merit, and Who Owe No Allegiance to Any
"Machine."
3 „C. P. HICKS
Vo ?^f^rEViaim'-
Backing his claims for considera
tion by several years' experience as a
contracting engineer engaged in in
dustrial and road work, C. P. Hicks
of Lacey, son of the Thurston county
pioneer Gwin Hicks, is running for
the office of county engineer on the
general policy of spending county
money on the secondary or county
roads—the utility roadft for the farm
ers—leaving it to the state to build
and maintain the main highways.
Mr. Hicks, being a native son and
a member of a pioneer family, is well
known throughout the county. He
was educated in the public schools of
the county and at St. Martin's col
lege, Lacey. He knows the county
from one end to the other, knows
what 4t needs and how important the
construction of secondary roads is to
Its proper development, and proposes
to devote most of his energies to
them, if elected county engineer.
Starting out on his professional
career, he worked for two years for
the St. Paul ft Tacoma Lumber com
pany of Tacoma, during which time
he placed all of the company's In
dustrial tracks in and around its big
plant, and also constructed a planing
mill. He left the employ of that
company to go to Aberdeen for the
Tacoma Dredging company in the ca
pacity of engineer where he success
fully placed an hydraulic All of
1,600,000 cubic yards of material for
less than 15 cents per yard.
He left Aberdeen to go to Everett,
where he made another big All for
the Weyerhaueser Timber company,
this one of 1,000,000 cubic yards, and
also was construction engineer in the
building of the Pacific highway across
Ebey island. In Snohomish county,
one of the most difficult pieces of
road work in the country. From
Everett he went to Seattle, where he
was engineer for the contractors who
successfully completed the second
unit of the Lake Washington canal.
At present he is living at the family
farm near Lacey.
Mr. Hicks is making the race for
county engineer on two important
points: First, that the office belongs
to the county and not the city, as the
city has its own engineer; and sec
ond, that he favors better roads for
the county, leaving to the state the
task of building the highways, by
which he means that the county
should have more and better second
ary roads, as well as primary high
ways, and that instead of spending all
the road funds for highway improve
ments. the money should be spent on
■ the ordinary county roads.
"WILSON DAY" OCT. 28
THROUGHOUT NATION
President's Address to People on
Americanism Will Be Read in
Meetings.
"Woodrow Wilson Day" will be ob
served throughout the United States
Saturday, October 28, according to an
announcement made this week by
Chairman McCormick of the Demo
cratic national committee.
On that day the president will ad
dress to the people of the country a
message on "Americanism," in which
he will point out anew his convictions
as to the position this nation should
maintain in the present world crisis.
"It is the plan," Chairman McCor
mick said, "to hold meetings all over
the country, at which the message
from the president will be read."
Chairmen of the Democratic state
committees in the various states will
co-operate with the county chairmen
In arranging for meetings on "Wood
row Wilson day," with speakers of
prominence.
"ThiJ message," It was announced
at Democratic national headquarters,
"Is to be a proclamation of American
ism, which will be read by a promi
nent citizen In each community. It is
planned to have this day on which all
citizens will pay their respects to the
president of the United States."
This message, It is asserted, will be
"a proclamation of the new freedom."
Twenty-seven years' experience in
teaching, 13 years of it in rural
schools and 14 in graded, fit Geo. E.
Conn of Plum Station, in the opinion
of himself and his many friends, for
the office of county superintendent of
schools for which he is a candidate on
the Non-Partisan ticket this year.
Mr. Conn has been teaching since
1911 In rural schools in this cdunty,
the first year at Chambers' Prairie,
then for two years as principal of the
Cat-Tail school. He is now teaching
Mto
.second year at Plum Station. He
knows the rural school conditions of
this county, he knows their troubles,
their needs, their handicaps and their
shortcomings, and he believes that
this knowledge coupled with his 27
years' experience as a teacher particu
larly fits him for the position through
wtolch, it elected, he could work to
improve the rural schools of the
county.
Mr. Coaa It a taxpayer in the Plum
Station district, whore he is wreating
a home out of the woods. He came to
Hiurston county in 1911 from King
county, where he had been teaching
far years, to camp oa some timber
land he owned here, and he liked the
country and the people so well he de
cided to remain and make his home
here. And when some of the people
of Thurston county particularly inter
ested in their country schools set
about to And a man whose experience
and ability so fitted him for the post
of county superitnendent of schools
that his administration would pro
mote their development and improve
ment, as they felt no city-schooled
man could do, Geo. E. Conn was the
man they urged to be a candidate.
Mr. Conn was born in the country
and has spent most of his life there.
He was raised on a farm in Illinois
and didn't get to start school until he
was 10 years old, but he graduated
from the high school at Champaign,
111., when he was 19 years old. after
making a three-year high school
course in two years in spite of the
fact that he had to leave school each
spring to help out in the farm work,
indicating that he more than made up
In industry and study and ability the
handicap of starting late and of being
able to spend only the fall and winter
months in school.
After his graduation he was em
ployed to teach the children of the
tenants on a 5,000-acre farm in
Champaign county, Illinois, and for

WILSON MEETING
i DRAWS BIG CROWD
FISHBURNE AMI M'LEAN AD
DRESS LARGE AUDIENCE ON
CAMPAIGN ISSUES.
Emphasis on the progressive, hu
mane idealism of Preisdent Wilson in
contrast to the reactionary, property
viewpoint of the Republican candi
date, Charles E. Hughes, featured the
addresses delivered by Geo. P. Fish
burne of Tacoma, Democratic candi
date for congress from this district,
and Henry Alberts McLean of Seattle,
Progressive nominee for attorney
general, betore a crowd of 250 men
and women. Democrats, Republicans,
Progressives and Socialists, at the
Y. M. C. A. hall Wednesday night.
It was the first local campaign
meeting of the current presidential
campaign and attracted a consider
ably larger «crowd than expected, •
crowd that cheered the speakers at
every mention of the name of Wood
row Wilson and every reference to
the progressive legislative and execu
tive achievements of his administra
tion. Attorney P. M. Troy, Demo
cratic state committeeman for this
county, presided.
Mr. Fishburne, who spoke first, re
called the Roosevelt panic of 190?
and Roosevelt's surrender to Wall
street to prevent a more severe panic,
by permitting the United States Steel
corporation to take over the Tennes
see Coal ft Iron company, and then
pointed out how, under the federal
reserve bank act passed during the
Wilson administration, the power to
force a panic had been taken out of
the hands of the big trusts and of
Wall street and the money power
taken from an oligarchy and "90ft
with the where it be
longs."
The Squabble Over "Pork."
He referred to the campaign talks
of Hughes and Congressman John
son aa being a will o' the wisp, diffi
cult to folow, because "Hughes went
the length and breadth of the land
condemning 'pork,' while Johnson 1 *
chief argument for re-election is the
Amount of pork he has obtained for
his district." As a remedy for
"pork," Mr. Fishburne proposed the
creation of a board of engineers com
posed of men such as Colonel Qoe
thals, "to determine what Improve
ments are needed, to standardise
postofflces according to the site of
towns, and to put improvements
where they are needed." .
Taking up the "Siamese twin," as
he called it the tariff Mr. .Fish
burne declared it to be a dead Issue,
"killed by President Wilson's tariff
commission which is to fix the tariff
rates just ss the Interstate commerce
commission fixes railroad rates," and
suggested that Mr. Hughes made his
best speeches on that subject because,
"Judging from the speeehes of his I
have read he is better qualified to de
liver a funeral oration than to be
president."
He discussed the federal shipping
bill and pointed out that Congress
man Johnson bad voted against It as
well as against the federal reserve
bank law. Recalling the pleas of big
private Interests for a ship subsidy
and their protests to the shipping
bill, he said: "The strange thing Is
that they are always in favor of gov
ernment assistance when It is eon
fined to themselves, but when it 1s
spread to all the people, suddenly we
are threatened with the dangerous
doctrine of socialism."
Discussing Wilson's foreign policy,
he said: "They sneer at the pen—
the only alternative Is the sword,"
and closed his address with the ques
tion: "Shall we turn back the hands
to the dollar Idealism of the days of
Mark Hanna, the hour of war. or for
ward to the humane idealism of
Woodrow Wilson, the hour of peace?**
In Introducing Mr. McLean, Mr.
Troy praised "the men who hare the
courage to step out of the party an 4
speak for Wilson becanse they be
lieve him to be right," but Mr. Mc-
Lean countered with the declaration:
"It doesn't take courage to work Car
Wilson In this campaign—it Is a mat
ter of principle." At the outset he
referred briefly to the state campaign,
