FROM THE PEOPLE
Lttttr from Htnry A. Minor.
Editor of th Beacon:
Matters and things at the Western
Democratic headquarters are going
smoothly now and a tremendous lot of
work fa being done. We are rid of
the vexations of getting things started
and oar work has impetus. A news
paper man who handles the two head
quarters here, Democratic and Repub
lican, said we had our opponents beat
a block in the way we were handling
oar work. But now that Taft's old
manager, Hitchcock, is in chsrge (and
he in charge let Wilcox and other
Republicans deny it as much as they
please) things may change, for in poli
tics he fa an expert professional, and
the inventor of ths "Steam-roller."
Our bureau handles all publicity mat
ter for all departments, including ad
vertising. Ws are taking on nothing
new now, only developing lines already
adopted, and to me is delegated the
duty of turning down all propositions.
My instructions are (1) give them some
southern courtesy and (2) tell them
we can't handle it, which 1 do to the
best of my ability.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels was
here last week and I interviewed him.
Other big men lately here were Wil
liam Jennings Bryan, Judge Ben Lind
sey, Vice-President Marshall and Cy
clone Davis of Texas. The last is six
I ,eet 2 or 3 inches and wore a collar;
). also a cravat and a very long Prince
) Albert coat, and a long horn hat, that
is a hat about one yard in diameter.
The president was here an hour and
a half the other morning, but did not
leave his car. He will be here again
on the 19th when I shall see him. His
Omaha speech and his whole trip west
was a great success and has given the
Reps a scare. It was already admitted
by them that we were strong in the
west, but they did not know how
strong we were.
I have been trying to figure out the
reasons for Republicad hopes and I can
see none, evei' from their own papers'
5 editorials and news columns except
that the country is normally
iSr vtlv TJcn. 'ilipr. inH ma rn'r.
change it this year. This is too much
like betting on the weather. Its nor
mally fair, but it rains floods some-
mes.
When I was about 21 1 got hold of
some old bound volumes or. fuck and
Harper's Weekly for the year 1884.
There's were I got my first interest in
big politics. I also got a somewhat
intimate knowledge of that great cam
paign, and to me this year is very much
like that. Raymond of the New York
Imes came over to Cleveland, just as
Springfield Republican comes to
Wilson: George William Curtis to
( I Cleveland as President Eliot of Har-
yard to Wilson; Carl Schurz, senator
i u. r : -i. -u:. t.
(Cleveland and Harry Garfield, son of
President Gai field, to Wilson; Puck
bame to Cleveland, Life comes to Wil
son. I don't recall the business men
of that day, but there were plenty of
Uhe best men in the Republican party
that supported Cleveland like Edison,
Henry Ford and the great hosts of
them are supporting them. I am gat
ing up a list now for publication and
will send yeu one.
Certainly the country is not now
more Republican than in 1884, and we
ave as good a cause and as good a
andidate as then. And we have a
better chance at the great labor vote.
The Republicans acknowledge this last,
at say that organized labor fa only
m per cent of the vote. Well, a ten
per cent gam win be plenty u gained
t the right places, and the labor vote
s right where the Democrats writ it.
here is no use in a Democrat worry-
no;. When our party appeals at once
o the good sense and the good con
nee of the nation we win as we did
h 1876, and '84 and '88, when we had
e popular vote but not the electoral,
nd '92. About 1912 an old lad wrote
Mt God in his wisdom split the Re-
lit . II. ir I i.
'juucin parcy 10 enaoie rimon u d
Elected, just as be in 1860 split the
democrats to secure the election of
ff incoln. She is from the north and
Ifcme of us may not agree with her as
) split t Democrats in 1860, but we
ipe she is rigt atxrjt 1912 and 1916.
LaBt night I went to see the pretty
ttle opera "Princess Pat (Patricia).
was very attractive, but not up to
tie Bohemian Girl or any of Gilbert
(id Sullivan's or The Singing Girl, but
fie uest of the late operas I have
ard. Some of the best wit in it wai
"His father was an Englishman and
mother a German, and be is hi
k n worst enemy." "A woman when
i e marries loses her most indulgent
fend." "Discretion is the best part
a vtlet." One vf osr Urease i
the Bureau of Information, generally
referred to as the Intelligence De
partment. I heard two workers in the
packing department disputing and one
said "You go ask the intelligent de
partment;."
One of the most interesting places in
Chi is a big animal store. You can
see any number of dogs, monkeys,
parrots, rabbits, hares, weasels, guinea
pigs and other things there. The pup
pies are beautiful, white esquimaux,
bulls, pointers, crocker spaniels and
every otier sort, including some little
temers about as big as a minute. There
are a hundred or so parrots from those
as large as turkeys to some no larger
than mocking birds. The clatter they
keep up fa deafening. The other morn
ing I stopped for a moment in passing
as I always do; there were about ten
Italians looking in the window at the
monkeys and chattering and theirs and
the parrots' chatter were very much
alike.
The first chance I get I am going out
to Lincoln Park where there is a big
zoo and see them feed the animals.
Everybody has been made familiar
with Senator Jim Ham Lewis' pink
whiskers through the way the Wash'
ington correspondents write them up
He, is a very dressy man (as smart as
he can be, too, or he would not be
Democratic senator from Illinois) and
fa accused ot posing as a certain dis
tinguished Mississippian is also. They
tell a joke on Jim Ham to the effect
that he came down to the convention
in Chicago dressed up to kill and as he
waited at the door to make an effect
ive entry Senator Vardaman strolled
into, a very conspicuous place in the
hall where everyone could see him,
dressed all in white, etc., whereupon
Jim Ham, in a state of mortification,
went home and would not come to the
convention at all. 1
I am certainly distressed to hear
about crop conditions in Noxubee and
East Mississippi.. H. M.

Dr. W. C. Linch of Weir, accom
panied by his wife, passed through
Ackerman Tuesday en route to Macon,
where they will make thtir home, and
where he will practice his profession
in the future. We regret to lose the
citizenship of Dr, Linch and his splen
did family. Dr. Linch has been a
successful practitioner at Weir for a
number of years and no physician in
the county stands higher in his pro
fession than does he. Ai d all that we
say of him as a physician we can say
of him as a man-he stands at the
very top tonally. The Weir people
hate to give up Dr. and Mrs. Linch
and their two daughters, because thty
have been among the first in every
movement for the social and civic im
provement of their town and vicinity.
Dr. Linch is well equipped in his pro
fession and we wish him the success
in hm new field that he has had here.
And we wish that every good thing
will flow into the lives of each member
of this excellent family in affluent
measure. Choctaw I'laindyaler.
