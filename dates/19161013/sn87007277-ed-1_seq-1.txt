TALL LEADER OF PHILADELPHIA ATHLETICS
Connie Mack's experience With Ills
host of youthful college ball players
continues unabated, but as yet with
outproductng any appreciable results.
Many experts say that there Is nut a
single good player among Mack's many
collegians, but such an assertion is too
broad and sweeping to be accurate,
writes Rodman Random in Philadel
phia Press. Undoubtedly in the outfit
are some players who, with the kind
of care and attention they will get
under this famous lender, will develop
Into great ball players.
However, the operation is certain to
be very slow, and baseball fans are Im
patient for results. The tediousness of
the operation Is due to the fact that
the tall leader is trying to construct a
whole team from green playersr Had
he held to a few of his veterans tie
There Is still some fight left in the
White Sox.
"Doc" Lavan is playing better ball
than ever before.
The Washington club has sold Its
right to Pitcher Ehmke to Detroit.
The Pittsburgh club Is loading up
with nil kinds of bush leaguers this
fall.
Kogcr Hornsby, the St. Louis phe
aom, is climbing rapidly in the batting
averages.
Hans Wagner has always been on
tho level. In fact, no player ever met
a ball more squarely.
John Beall, the former White Sox
player, Is leading the American asso
clatlou with the bat.
"Ed'' Fltzpntrlck is making a hit
with Boston "fans" by his pluying in
place of "Johnny" Evers.
Rowdy Elliott Is a real backstop.
His work stamps him as the right kind
to stick In the big show.

veloped them rapidly, and then have
supplanted the veterans. Then at no
time would ho have hud a whole team
of rookies. The developing players
would have had a few old heads upon
whom to depend whereas they now play

Does Connie Mack count this policy

tlie operation to too great lengths?
This may be Indicated by the fact that
Harry Davis, his trusty lieutenant, has
been doing considerable scouting of

JOHNSTON HELPS DODGERS

young outfielder secured from the Feds,
had been a big help to the Dodgers un

In the game, in the judgment of Man

HOW MAMAUX GOT HIS START
Pirate Pitcher Began Playing Under
Lee Fohl, Then Manager of the

Pitcher Al Mnmaux of the Pirates
got his start under Lee Fohl, when the
present Cleveland manager was man
aging the Huntington team. When
the Pirates and Indians both were in
Chicago recently and stopping nt the
same hotel, Fohl nnd Maniaux had an
experience meeting.
"Take care of that arm of yours,"
said Fohl to the Pirate pitcher.
'What do you care about it? I'm not
on your club now," answered Mumaux.
'No, but I might want to draft you
Into a real major league some day,"
was Fohl's comeback.
"Huh, I'd like to' be In the Amort-

something at that," said the Pint
pitcher. '
MAGIC OF SURGICAL SCIENCE
IS MAKING NEW MEN OF OLD
tome Remarkable Instances Where Operations Have Practically
Rebuilt Vital and Important Portions of the Human Body
That Had Been Shot Away in the Battles "Gas
Gangrene" Is Surgeon's Worst Enemy.
London. The marvelous progress
that has been made In recent times In
surgical . science is most Impressively
revealed by a journey to some of the
larger military hospitals, made possi
ble through tho courtesy of Sir Alfred
Keogh, director general of the army
medical service.
In all the hospitals what tho medical
staff set above all Is conservative sur
gerythat Is to say, the saving of
limbs In order that the patients may
remain useful members of the com
munity. Thus, at the Herbert hospital,
at Shooter's Hill, there havo been
since the beginning of the war from
three to four thousand operations, nnd
Colonel Simpson, the officer In charge,
declared that he did not believe there
had been In all more than 25 primary
amputations.
The impression left by a tour of
these hospitals upon the layman's mind
Is that outsiders have an utterly In
Adequatc Idea of the debt they owe
to modern surgery at a time like the
present. Day by day the surgeons
are giving to the nation new men for
old. They have embarked upon a
great mission of hope among the na
tion's soldiers. They are doing more
than would have been credible twenty
years ago to rob war of Its ultimate
horror.
Out of the hundreds of wonderful
cases brought to one's notice during
these visits It Is only possible to de
scribe a few that may be regarded as
typical of this trade of mending sol
diers. Take first the1 new nerve sur
gery. Here Is a man with a bullet
hole near his collar bone which sev
ered the nerve controlling the muscles
of the wrist. The result was "wrist
drop" and n hand which until quite re
cently would have been regarded as
Incurably useless. The two ends of
the severed nerve havo been freed
from what had already become no
more than a scar, they havo been re
united nnd there Is every prospect thnt
In less than a year the hand will be
almost as good as ever.
"As simple as tying up the two ends
of a cut telephone wire," says the sur
geon who operated.
Amazing Nerve Case.
There are more remarkable nerve
cases still. A man had part of the
fleshy portion of his arm shot away,
carrying with It four Inches of the
nerve necessary to control the hnnd
moveipents. The surgeon rung up sev
eral hospitals on the telephone till he
heard of what he wanted, the ampu
tation thnt afternoon of a healthy limb.
The limb happened to be a leg, and
it was amputated in the afternoon. No
sooner was it cut off than four or five
Inches f practically living nerve were
removed from the calf, placed In n
saline bath and rushed by taxi to the
other hospital. Here the patient was
already under an anesthetic. The
wound In his arm was opened with a
lancet, the ends of the Indispensable
nerve quickly found and the circuit
re-established, as It were, by means of
the first patient's four inches of fila
ment. Today the man Is In a fair way
of regaining the full use of his hnnd.
Bone surgery on rather similar lines
Is more familiar, but hardly less sur
prising when you meet nnd talk to a
man who converses with the aid of a
lower Jaw part of which was only a
few weeks ago part of his right leg.
It was mended with two and one-half
inches of one of his shin bones. The
shin has quite healed, and the hole
will be completely filled with new bone
LOST HIS MEMORY AT FIRE I
Indiana Man, Who Was in Iroquois Dis
aster in Chicago, Forgot
Hi Past Life.
Blnghamton, N. Y. After being
riven up as dead 13 years. Milton Sim
mons, Kokomo, Ind., real estate dealer,
has returned to ills mother, Mrs.
Cecelia Simmons, Syracuse.
Simmons tells a remurkable story of
his loss of memory resulting from the
Iroquois lire In Chicago. He was oper
ntlng a spot light In the bnlcony when
the fire broke out anil he wns plunged
GO feet Into the bodies below, but was
rescued. The fall caused loss of mem
ory, and after two months In a hos
pital he recovered, going to Tipton,
Ind.. where he engaged in business
nnd married. Later he went Into the i
real estate business In Kokomo, where
he now resides.
Increasing pressure on the brain
from the Injury resulted in the neces
sity for an operation last winter, anil
following this, be gradually regained
memory of his mother and his former
life. -
before long, so accommodating Is na
ture when treated with knowledge.
Another patient Is perfectly happy
and prosperous with three Inches of
the fibula of his left leg neatly mor
tised In the humerus of his right arm.
He, too, will finally suffer no loss of
bone whatever. The variants of such
operations are endless and only limited
by the ingenuity and enterprise of
each surgeon.
Carpentry and Legs.
Of remarkable examples of carpen
try applied to broken limbs most hos
pitals have two or three, If not more,
on hnnd. A young fellow was brought
into the hospital with one leg short
ened by five inches, owing to the ends
of the broken bone overlapping. He
seemed n hopeless cripple. The leg
was rebroken under an anesthetic, an
eighth of an inch cut off from each
side of the fracture so as to secure a
smooth joint, and a steel plate fastened
on with six screws, precisely as one
would mend the broken leg of a table.
The plate and screws will remain In
position as a permanent addition to
the soldier's anatomy, for steel will
not rust among the tissues. And the
man has a leg practically as long and
as straight as, and rather stronger
than, It was Intended to be by nature.
Some of the most cruel wounds are
those In the Jaw, but even here what
the skill and patience of the surgeon
have been able to do Is wonderful. One
poor fellow who had been provided
with a new roof to his mouth was one
of the most cheerful of the patients.
His comic songs are the delight of the
ward. You cease to be amazed at any
height of human skill or human cour
age after a few hours in any of these
military hospitals. You know for cer
tain then that man is unconquerable.
Where the Injury is to the upper
part of the face, resulting In, say, the
removal of the nose and one eye, magi
cal results are being achieved In a
southwestern district hospital by the
provision of masks perfectly counter
felting tho lost section of the physiog
nomy. Lieut. Denny nt Wood is tho
inventor of the plan. With the help of
photographs of what a patient was like
before being wounded he will make n
false nose of silvered copper, artistic
ally painted to match the surrounding
complexion, which will so far defy de
tection as to enable the owner to go
oat into the world again without
shrinking and play his old part in the
affairs of men.
A Remarkable Operation.
Here Is nnother remarkable case.
Not long ngo n wounded Guardsman
was brought Into the Queen Alexandra
hospital at Millbank, suffering from a
shrapnel wound. Examination under
the X-rays showed that a piece of
metal as large as a halfpenny and
much thicker had entered the breast
and lodged In the region of the heart
It wns. In fact, actually touching the
heart and Impeding Its action. An op
eration was decided on, and the sur
geon thrust his luind right Into the
opening and pulled out the piece of
inetul, which is preserved as a sou
venir. There was a danger that dur
ing anesthesia tho lungs would col
lapse, and therefore ether was pumped
Into them to keep them distended.
That gallant Guardsman Is now out
and about, nnd It Is declared that he
will not feel the slightest ill effects
from his strange experience.
In this hospital there Is at present n
Serbian officer who was wounded In
his own country nnd brought to Eng
land for treatment. It was a case of

severe Injury to the jaw. Lieut Sir
Francis Fanner removed t piece of
bone about two and a half laches long
from the tibia of the patient, and,
having carefully prepared a bed In
which to place It, fixed it In the Jaw.
The leg Is now healed and the patient
can eat wonderfully welt
But this refitting and, as It were,
rebuilding of citizens is not enough.
They must first be snatched from that
progressive process of destruction as
sociated with the dreaded word sepsis,
that creeping death of the tissues
which is the surgeon's most remorse
less enemy. And here again one en
counters the marvellous.
In this war the variety of sepsis that
has claimed more victims than any,
other is that known In doctor's slans;
as "gas gangrene." Gas gangrene is
caused by the presence in a wound of
certain types of bacilli classed as
"anaerobic," that Is, bacilli which can
not live In air, the vital principle of
which Is oxygen. They exist like the
tetanus bacilli In cultivated soil, and
It Is because the war is being fought in
France among the peasants' fields that
they are introduced to constantly by
ricocheting bullets or scraps of earth
stained clothing Into the soldiers'
wounds.
Once there they set about producing
tiny gas bubbles among the tissues,
hence the name "gas gangrene." Bat
the gas they cannot endure is oxygen,
and the obvious way to destroy them
is to Introduce oxygen into the inner
most recesses of the wound. This is
secured by various methods according
to tho nature of the injury. A hole
right through the shoulder will be ster
ilized by the use of a wick drawing
peroxide of hydrogen from a small
tank above the bed. Another kind of
wound may be sprayed with ozone and
the third more conveniently dealt with
by means of a perforated tube fed with
oxygen gas from a cylinder.
The operations to which reference
has been made would doubtless be de
scribed as severe even by the surgeons
themselves; nevertheless, modern sci
ence has robbed them of most of their
terrors. The Improvements in aner
thetics have been such that it is no
uncommon thing for an operation to
last two hours and for the patient to
feel no ill effects from the drug a
quarter of an hour after be recovers
consciousness. Some, indeed, will be
smoking a cigarette within that space
of time. The secret lies in the admin
istration of oxygen with the anesthetic.

That at least is the Impression of un

In case of a policy covering the pe

the rote quoted Is 85 guineas ($89.25)
per cent, while If taken out for three

60 guineas ($63) to June 30, 1917, or
1G guineas ($15.75) per cent less If the
