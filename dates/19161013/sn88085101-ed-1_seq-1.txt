PREPARING TO IMPROVE.
Geo. Major has been engaged to sur
vey the overflow line on the Slmilka
nieen river, just above the falls that it
is calculated will be submerged with
the construction of the proposed dam
by the Okanogan Valley Power com
pany, that recently acquired the Sim
ilkameen power plant. Mr. Major start
ed in on the survey Monday, it is the
intention of the now company this win
ter to construct a dam 55 feet high at
a narrow point on the river above the
falls, and that retaining wall will push
back the waters of the river some dis
tance. As the banks of the river are
quite precipitous, and the fall very
rapid, the amount of land subjected to
inundation 1s limited in extent as to
acreage. However, it is necessary to
know accurately the extent of this
prospective overflowed land and Mr.
Major 1s now surveying and making
an estimate. One encouraging feature
about the employment of Mr. Major for
this purpose is the evidence that the
new company contemplates carrying
out the promise of making extensive
improvements at the fulls, which
means better and more satisfactory
service both us to the character of the
lighting and extent of electric power.
RECEPTION.
A reception will be tendered to Rev,
F. L. Cook, of the M. E. church, at the
church building, next Friday evening,
October 20th, to which everybody is
cordially invited. Mr. Cook has re
cently taken charge as pastor of the
Methodist church, and has already won
the friendship of those of our citizens
whom he has met without as well as
within the circle of his church mem
bership.
Everett Henry, who has been sta
tioned at this place for the past three
years as immigration inspector, has
been transferred to New York. Mr.
Henry left here some three weeks ago
on his regular 30 day vacation to visit
his home at Redbanks, N. J., and while
at home succeeded in securing his
transfer to an eastern station. Mr.
Henry has a large number of friends
in this community who will miss him
and trust that at some future time he
may return to Oroville.

AN INTERESTING LECTURE.
According to announcement, A. P
Olinger, connected with the Moline
r:? com . p “ y - - -Sn
in on* f disseminate information
among farmera on the best means
resuUs Ur n g T* adv »“*W OU s
results in carrying on that in
dustry, lectured before a very
meagre audience m the library
building Saturday afternoon. Tha
Pity of it is that so few farmers were
present as they would have learned
mU / r ? ra wh,ch could have
profited. Mr. Ollnger is an experienced
and a practical farmer, and has car
r ed on experiments for years for the
single purpose of gathering informa
tion as to the best methods of prepar
lug ground, planting and the cultiva
tion of all kinds of grains. He has been
a close student of plant life, and fur
thermore has a happy faculty of ex
plaining results that have followed his
experiments. He is an easy and fluent
talker and thoroughly familiar with
the subjects that he treated. To one
who closely follows it, plant life Is a
fascinating study, and to hear a man
who knows what he is talking about
explain the nature of soils and the
mystery of germination and final ma
turing of grain is a revelation. One la
Impressed with how little the average
man knows about the most common
things In nature.
The text ot Mr. Olinger'a lecture was
“Better Seeds and Soil Culture," and
the few who were so fortunate as to be
present listened to a moat interesting
and Instructive discourse on the sub
jects. It is hard to believe that there Is
so much to learn as to the right and
wrong way of preparing ground and
planting seed to secure the best re
sults, Too many men engaged in farm
ing think they know it all, yet If they
could only listen to Mr. Oiinger for an
hour they would be convinced that
they hardly knew the first rudiments
of real, scientific farming that Insures
much better returns for labor perform
ed than could possibly be hoped for
from the system at present followed.
He showed by facts and figures that
the farmers of the United States waste
by overseeding enough grain every
year to feed all the people of the
country for three months, failing en
tirely to secure any returns for the ex
cess use of seed. He demonstrated by
the same means that wastefulness on
the farm through cariesaness, ignor
ance and loose methods Is something
appalling.
Every farmer in the country would
profit by bearing Mr. Oiinger lecture.
He explains what he knows iu lan
guage easily understood, and tbe in
formation he conveys is made plainer
by a series of drawings of soil stratus,
comparative fields of grain, the rami
fication of root growth and the pro
cess of germination tn grain. It is re
gretted that more farmers were not out
to hear him Saturday afternoon.
AN EFFICIENT OFFICER.
M. J. Flynn, chief deputy county
treasurer, was in Oroville over Mon
day night. Mr. Flynn is a candi
date for county treasurer. His name Is
on the republican ticket, but he has
made such a creditable record in the
treasurer’s office that for their own
protection tax payers should support
him regardless of political leanings.
Under the administration of Treasurer
Quackonbush the office has been con
ducted 100 per cent efficient, at a min
imum cost to the county, and during
the administration Mr. Flynn has held
the position of chief deputy. He has
contributed largely towards placing
the office on the high standard that it
has reached. Mr. Flynn’s motto Is
"Efficiency and Economy,” and it is a
motto not wholly without meaning, for
he proposes to live up to It strictly
when elected, for his election Is as
sure as the coming of November 7. The
public has always found Mr. Flynn
corteous and accommodating In the
discharge of his duties, and that atti
tude toward the public has won him
the friendship of all who have had
business with the office during his
Incumbency as deputy. He will carry
the same virtues into the office as the
head of the department, and that
knowledge among the people will win
for him a multitude of votes.
SUNDAY SCHOOL INSTITUTE.
The Sunday schools of Okanogan
county arc divided Into six districts,
and Orovllle Is located In what Is
known in the Sunday school organiza
tions as Osoyoos district, which com
prises most of the north end of the

tion or Institute each year In October
This vear the local Institute will be
held in Methodist church on Monday
afternoon and evening, October 23rd.
There will be a speaker from the

SMALL EIRE,
Wednesday morning between 2 and
3 o’clock the small residence owned by
Harry Bassett, located at the foot of
the hill below the high school building
was totally destroyed by fire. The fire
was discovered by Chas, Powell, Jr.,
and Fred Hart and they had much dif
ficulty In arousing the telephone office
and turning In an alarm. The weird
moan of the siren jerked half the
population out of bed but by the time
the fire department had arrived on the
scene the building was almost totally
consumed. The house was built by
Mrs. Anna Wentworth and was sold a
short time ago to Harry Bassett. Mr.
Bassett carried SIOO insurance on the
house and S2OO insurance on the con
tents in the London Assistance com
pany, represeted by Dell Hart. The
cauae of the fire is unknown. Mr. Bas
sett and a companion 'were in the
building In the evening, but they claim
that no fire was built while they were
on the premises.
A REFORMED POLITICIAN.
L. Roy Slater of Spokane, stopped
over In Oroville last Friday night on
his way home from a trip to Loomis.
Mr. Slater is well known in this state
on account of his political activities
during the past four years. There have
been progressives and progressives In
Washington since the day progressiv-
Ism came In vogue, but for unadulter
ated, wild eyed, noisy progresslvlsm,
Mr. Slater stood In a class by himself.
He was boisterously uncompremising
and vigorously vituperative in his de
nunciation of any thing political that
did not have a big stick attachment,
and was the king pin of the progressive
party In Spokane. But Mr. Slater Is
back with his idol In the republican
ranks. The weekly wobbling Wilson
administration was too much for him.
He realizes that with a return of peace
In Eurpoe with Wilson In power,
means disaster to the business Inter
ests of the United States, and ho is do
ing his part to prevent such a calamity
as democratic success in November by
advocating the election ot Hughes. It
is the only position any man having
the welfare of his country at heart can
assume In this crisis.
THE BLACKWELL OPENING.
Next Friday evening, October 20th,
Blackwell’s new store at Riverside will
be thrown open to the public with a
grand reception and dance. The new
brick store building is one ot the most
modern and complete structures for
the purpose In the county, covering a
very large floor space. There will be a
crowd present from all parts of the
valley, larger even than that which at
tended the opening of the Tonasket
store and that crowd surpassed any
thing of like kind ever seen In the
county. Mr. Blackwell with his crew
of assistants, will make it pleasant for
all who attend, no matter the number.
Oroville no doubt will send a large
delegation to Riverside on this occas
ion. A special train will leave Oroville
at 8 o’clock p. m„ returning leave Riv
erside between 4 and 5 o'clock Satur
day morning.
Hoskyn-Harding.
On Tuesday evening at the home of
Rev. A. W Bond, Joseph P. Hoskyn
and Miss Bernice E. Harding were
uuited in marriage in the presence of
only a very few Intimate friends. The
newly weds will make their home in
Orovllle, residing in the south part of
town. The bride, a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. ,T. A. Harding, is a capable young
lady who has grown up from girlhood
In this place, and the groom is a most
worthy and likeable young genleman,
the son of H. P. Hoskyn. The newly
married couple have many friends in
Orovllle, who will Join with the Ga
zette in wishing the young couple all
manner of happiness and prosperity in
the marriage state.
POMONA GRANGE MEETING.
The next meeting of Okanogan
County Pomona Grange No. 22 will be
held at Horse Springs Coulee, Grange
hall, northeast of Tonasket, on Friday,
October 27th. Conveyances will meet
all who conic by train at Tonasket and
take them to and from the meeting.
R. W. Starr, of Pateros, who attend
ed the recent meeting at Spokane ot
the government commission that has In
charge the institution of the new gov
ernment loan law passed by the last
national congress, has consented to be
present and address the meeting on
this subject, which Is of deep interest
to all farmers.
A number of other Important matters
will come before this meeting and a
large attendance Is urged to be pres
ent.
W. T. BEALS.
Pomona Press Agent.
AT THE OKPHEUM.
For Saturday and Sunday evenings
the Orpheum will present “The Soul’s
Cycle,” an exceedingly strong dramatic
feature. In which will appear the beau
tiful motion picture star, Margaret
Gibson, and a specially engaged cast of
artists. This Is a five act mutual mas
terpiece, and Is up to the standard of
the productions staged by that com
pany. In addition there will be the reg
ular Keystone comedy, an amusing
feature that always pleases the crowd.
The Orpheum Is soon to put on a high
class and high priced new lino of films
but there will be no change In the
popular prices.
HARVEST FESTIVAL.
A Harvest Festival and Farmer's In
stitute is to be held at Okanogan next
Tuesday and Wednesday, October 17
and 18, which promises to be a most
interesting event and one that will at
tract a large attendance from all parts
of the county. Liberal prizes are of
fered for exhibits including grains,
forage crops, vegetables, fruits, etc. It
Is regretted that lack of space prevents
a more extnded notice with a list of
the prizes offered. We feel safe in
promising all who attend a most en
joyable time, as the good people of
Okanogan will do all in their power
to make It pleasant for their guests.
TRINITY EPISCOPAL CHURCH.
(O. H. Severance, Dean.)
Services will be held on next Sunday
morning at 11 a. m., with sermon.
Sunday school will meet every Sunday
immediately after the morning service,
at 12. If your child Is not In Sunday
school why not send It here next Sun
day.
Trinity Guild will meet on next Wed
nesday at 2:30 p. m. and it Is hoped
that every member will be present.
AT THE LYRIC THEATRE.
Blanch Sweet, the beautiful and
popular star of the Lasky company,
will be seen at the Lyric theatre next
Saturday and Sunday in the production
ot the thrilling drama “The Black-
List,” by Marion Fairfax and William
C, De Mllle, (he two noted dratlsts who
wrote this famous production especial
ly for Miss Sweet.
The thoughts of the “black list”
struck terror to the heart of every
miner, for once his name was placed
iu its columns, it meant no more em
ployment with a mining company. How
Blanch Sweet, as a country school
teacher in a small mining town, forced
the big corporation to abandon this
procedure is presented In the story
which is as thrilling as it is unusual,
lu addition to this noted production
there will be the usual Bray's cartoon,
depicting "Col. Heza Liar and the Ban
dits” which will be worth the price ot
admission alone.
On Wednesday and Thursday Mae
Murray will occupy the screen in a
production ot that celebrated romance
of history, "To Have and to Hold” an
elaborate production of Mary John
ston's fascinating book. This is a story
of the olden colonial days of Virginia
when a man not only married a woman
but had to hold on to her with a shot
gun and a few other miscellaneous fire
arms or have some other fellow take
her away from him. Captajn Percy, a
young Virginian fully demonstrated
that he had the strength and bravery
not only to get married but to protect
his wife afterwards. This is a hum
dinger of a story and you’ll miss
a good thing if you don’t see it.
Jas. Jackson is making extensive
improvement on his residence in the
south part of town.
Most of the marketable cattle around
Loomis have been sold during the past
few days, and they brought the top
price, ranging from 5 1-2 to 6 1-2 cents.
Jimmie Jackson of this place, secured
a large share of the spoils and the bal
lance went to the Little-Wetzell com
pany. A large number of cattle were
turned off, running high in dollars In
the aggregate. The northern Okanogan
cattle have always been considered the
best that goes on the market, and the
quality is improving every year, for
the cattle men are breeding up to a
better grade. Owing to the shortage of
range the cattle industry of Okanogan
county is not what it was twenty years
ago, still many head are raised annu
ally for the market, and through that
source a large amount of money is put
in circulation every year.

Young and Sparsely Settled.
(Fulmer Mountalu Prospector, Oct.
15, 1897.)
Dr. C. F. Webb Just returned from a
visit to tbe Eureka camp, where the
Republic mine has just been discovered
and from which the present city of re
public took Its name, and where Dr.
Webb is living today. The doctor was
very enthusiastic over the richness of
the Republic mine, and predicted for
the camp a great future. According to
his report “the gold bearing lode Is
only claimed to be ten feet wide, and
the average values estimated to be S7O
per ton.” As the doctor described the
claim the "ledge is on a knoll, knob or
hogback, a few hundred feet above the
stream (Eureka) from which the camp
derives its name. The character of the
deposit is something that puzzles the
oldest miner, it lies in a porphrey for
mation and is a gray colored llmeltke
crystallzed quartz without the sem
blance of mineral In it so far as the
eye can detect. Neither can mineral be
discovered with a glass, and It will not
pan. Yet this hungry, barren stuff will
assay all the way from S3O to $175 to
the ton.” Much excitement followed the
Republic find. The mine was sold for
an enormous sum, an immense plant
was installed and yet the property
never paid the company that expended
so much money In machinery. The Re
public never came up to expectations.
In those days a Loomis route was
agitated to the Klondyke mines In
Alaska, which were drawing hordes of
people from all parts of the world.
Many gold hunters wore expected to
route through to the north via Loomis,
but that highway to Alaska never be
came popular.
Frank Raborg and John B. Massam
were doing development work on the
Red Jacket and Little Falla claims, a
few miles south of Loomis. Nothing
ever came of those properties, although
Dell Hart, now of Oroville, subsequent
ly did considerable work on the claims.
Of Raborg and Massam’s whereabouts
nothing la known.
A great roar was going up over the
delivery of mails. Mall was five days
reaching Loomis from Spokane and six
days from Seattle. Now, people kick if
they do not receive mail regularly from
those cities every 24 hours.
The Prospector reports that "Joe
Hunter, one of the most widely known
prospectors In the northwest, has had
ah offer to go to Klondyke.” Joe did
not go. and is now a resident of Oro
ville, looking hardly a day older than
he did 19 years ago.
Wm. McDanie lhad a narrow escape
from death. Driving a team attached to
a load of logs the horses became
frightened, Mr. McDaniel was thrown
to the ground and the wheels passed
over him. Strange to say. he experienc
ed no serious injury, and lived until a
few weeks ago.
The fall of 1897 was quite cold and
the peaks of the surrounding moun
tains were covered with snow by Oct.
15th.
Judge Gregg was having his store
greatly Improved. Although far ad
vanced In years the Judge Is still living
and at present Is down in Florida.
Ike Lee was rounding up a large
band of horses to take to Ashcroft, B.
C., in the spring. Mr. Lee was a resi
dent of Ontario the last heard ot him.
Wm. Shufoldt, who was the local bar
ber, was congratulating himself over
holding some claims near the Repub
lic mine. But William never realized
anything from that property and for
years he has been a resident of Texas
handling land for Ex-Governor Hay.
Mow does this sound in this day and
age: “The stage came In from both
ways Tuesday, but there was only the
local mail to deliver from the south.
The Conconully stage made the trip
Sunday, carrying the mail, but that
was to accommodate a passenger. And
here Is where the traveler and the
stage driver are discommoded by the
new order ot things. If he leaves Spo
kane Friday, by the way of Coulee City,
he is hung up at Bridgeport a day. If
ho leaves the big city Thursday he lays
over a day at Conconully, unless the
stage man makes an extra trip. The
present arrangement is a nuisance any
way you look at It.”
j, A. Loomis is at the county seat
this week attending court. (Mr. Loomis
subsequently went insane and died In
the hospital at Medical Lake.)
Mrs. J. T. McDonald passed through
town Saturday on her way to Join her
husband at Oroville from a visit with
friends at Yakima and Ellensburg.
Both Mr. and Mrs, McDonald died
some years ago.)
W, W. Cloud, a young gentleman who
has been employed at the Wyandotte
mill for some time. Is now Installed as
bookkeeper for the Ixiomlston Trading
Co. (Mr Cloud is now engaged In
business at Tonasket as member of the
firm of Cloud & Dodge.)
O S. Stocker has accepted a position
for a few months with J. A. Loomis &
Co (Mr. Stocker is now a resident of
Wenatchee.)
j Dan McGlllvery, ex-county commls
sioner and for years a resident of this
county, came in Saturday from North
port, where he is now located. The gen
tleman reports Northport to be on the
broad road to prosperity. The new
smelter the Le Rol people are building
is nearing completion, and it will con
tribute materially toward making
Northport a city. (But the smelter fail
ed to smelt for long and Northport for
years was the deadest town in the
91.60 PER TSAR
state.. Recently the smelter has started
up, and today Northport la the llvllest
town for Its size In Washington. And
so the world moves.)
J. A. Gadbury has purchased the
building in the south part of town, at
one time used as a school house, and
will occupy It with hts family In order
that his children may attend school
this winter. (Mr. Gadbury Is still a res
ident of Loomis.)
A. C. Kingsbury and Capt. P. Curls
were working the Hercules. (A prop
erty that has never been heard of from
that day to this. Messrs Kingsbury and
Curtz went from Loomis to Nevada and
passed out of existence so tar as the
older residents of this county know.
The notice of final proof of Simman
der Sogle appears In the Prospector
and the land upon which Mr. Sogle was
making proof embraces a portion of the
townsite of Oroville.
Malnart Lauber advertised to make
proof on his Okanogan valley ranch,
just below Orovllle, Mr. Lauber la now
living In Loomis.
W. V. Champneys and Fred C. Rluer
advertised a dissolution notice. They
were running a blacksmith shop. (Mr,
Rltzer is still a resident of Loomis in
the blacksmlthtng business and Mr.
Champneys lives In Seattle.)
Roger Finan and Ueorge Haskell
were conducting a saloon at Qoldeu.
(Both men are dead.)
F, W. Hankey was practicing law at
Couconully. (Mr. Hankey, an except*
ionally bright lawyer, went to Mono
lulu, but bis present wherabouta are
unknown.)
The largest store In the upper coun
try was that of the Loomlaton Trading
Company, conducted by Qeo. H. Ellis
and Jas. E. Forde. (Both gentlemen
are now residence of Spokane, but have
extensive Interests In Okanogan coun
ty. that require their presence here
frequently. Both gentlemen, by-the
way, are in Orovllle this week.)
W. L. Davis operated the stage line
between Bridgeport and Conconully.
(Mr. Davis died In this place some two
year ago, and the family still live In
Orovllle.)
The Northern hotel was conducted
in Loomis by E. W. Pember. (The pres
ent home of Mr. Pender Is not known.)
F. H. Mason, former resident of Loo
mis, and now engaged In business at
Bridgeport, was married at Seattle to
a Miss Lindsey. (Mr. Mason afterwards
was a prominent merchant of Repub
lic, but his present home la not
known.)
Dr. Fred J. Whittaker, the well
known Republic physician, accompan
ied by his father, Dr. P. E. Whittaker,
stopped over in Orovllle Tuesday night
on a swift run through the valley. Dr.
Fred had been called to Anglin to see
a patient, and having induced hla
father to make the run with him, ex
tended hts tour of observation as far
south as Okanogan and then north to
