WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.?Admiral
Mayo, commanding the Atlantic fle^t.
notified the navy department today
that he had ordered a survey of the
New England coast to investigate re
ports that belligerent ships had es
tablished a base there or that wire
less plants were being operated in
violation of American neutrality.
In announcing Admiral Mayo's ac
tion. Secretary Daniels said today
that several destroyers already had
been despatched from Newport north
and that the work would be done
under the admiral's direction and
without instruction from Washington.
Naval oflicials here did not place
much credence in the reports and
characterized them as an outcome of
the recent operations of the German
submarine U-53. Numerous reports
of the same character have been re
ceived by the department since the
beginning of the war. Investigation
was made in each instance but was
unproductive.
LONG LINE OF PATROL
IS IN OPERATION NOW
NEWPORT. It. I.. Oct. 13?A far
flung patroi by torpedo boat destroy
ers charged with the double duty of
enforcing neutrality observance and
saving lives in event of further sub
marine raids on shipping off these
shores was put into effect from Bar
Harbor, Me., to New York today. Of
ficial authority for the statement that
such a patrol had been ordered by j
the navy department was obtained
here this morning.
The limits of the line of coast sur
veillance at present effective was1
shown today with the arrival of the
destroyer Paulding off Bar Harbor,
^ Me., and the activity of the Sterrett
in New York harbor. Between these
two outposts nine other destroyers 1
were weaving a net of observation
that extended a considerable distance l
out to sea well beyond the lanes of
coastwise vessels.
In Narragansett bay seven other1
destroyers were kept at routine j
target practice with steam constantly
up ready for an emergency call. The
fuel ship Jason, which left here re- j
cently with a full supply of oil. came!
in during the night for atore. All
vessels, It was said, were well pro
visioned.
The operations of the patrol are!
being directed from the flagship
Birmingham, headquarters of Rear
Admiral Albert Gleaves. The Blr-:
mingham is at this port, also in read
iness to move at any moment.
Except in war game maneuvers the
coast has not been covered by naval i
forces in such manner for years. j
Confirmation that the British!
steamship Bovic sighted a submarine
off the coast was contained In a state-;
ment by a naval ofllcial here today, j
He said: ?
"A passenger steamer reported to 1
Nantucket shoals lightship that it had j
sighted a German submarine well
astern this morning."
No location was given nor was the
direction of the submarine stated.

THE FROST
Which the Exponent Fakers Have Had So Much to Say About.
??.?.???
PARADE OPPOSED
BY THE PRESIDENT
According to General Sherrill
Who Acted as Grand Mar
shal on That Occasion.
NEW 'YOUK.0T&ct"L"Yif.?-General
Charles H. Sherrill, who was grand
marshal of the New York city pre
paredness parade of l^st spring, is
sued a statement at Republican na
tional headquarters today charging
that the Washington administration
endeavored for political reasons to
prevent that parade. This effort hav
ing failed, subsequently, it will be
remembered. President Wilson him
self took part in a preparedness
parade in Washington. Mr. Sherlll's
statement says:
"Mr. Kidder's statement in the
newspapers that the administration
has for some time been attempting
to ?*onclllate what they frequently
call the German-hyphenate vote re
calls to my mind an experience of
last spring which tends to confirm
his statement. At that time for six
weeks I, with some of my friends,
was engaged in organized the pre
paredness parade which took place in
this city on May 13. About two
weeks before that date I received an
urgent telephone request to come to
the mayor's office. Upon arrival there
I was told that a long distance tele
phone message had just been received
from the administration in Washing
ton urging that the preparedness
parade be abandoned on the ground
that it would irritate our American
citizens of German birth or descent,
might cause riots in the street and,
therefore, be most undesirable. Of
course, I was astounded by this re
quest and stated that, in my'opinion,
sidestepping a crisis was not the best
way to meet It, especially If not as
sured that it really was a crisis. I
asked time to consider the matter and
it was given me. It was made clear
that the extraordinary suggestion did
not originate with the mayor but
came from the administration in
Washington.
"In order to ascertain if this was
a real or only an imaginary crisis,
prepared for political purposes I con
ferred with Mr. Carl L. Schurz, a
childhood friend,, told him what had
been said to me at the mayor's office,
expressed my opinion that it was
based upon an entire misconception
of our German-American citizens and
their loyalty to our land and in this
opinion he heartily agreed. Ho went
at once to see his friends and had a
number of conferences concerning
which I cannot speak because I was
not present at any of thom. I learned
that as a result of his efforts, Mr.
Bernard Ridder personally went to
the mayor's office and assured his
honor that not only was there no fear
of any rioting or other disloyal be
havior on the part of American citi
zens of German antecedents but
also that the German language press
of this city would endorse and sup
port the parade. I myself never hare
seen Mr. Bernard Ridder.
"More than ninety other cities also
had preparedness parades and about
^2,850,000 persons took part in them.
From none of these cities did I hoar
of any real opposition by American I
citizens of German descent to these,
parades. On the contrary they took
part in large numbers.
"The attempt of the administration
to stop the New York parade was
not only an unjust reflection upon the
loyalty of Americans of German;
origin, but also a disingenlous bid by
Washington for their political sup-1
port. It was likewise the one single,
instance in all that great movement
on the part of anybody to use it for
the purpose of playing politics."

HUGHES PERILED
IN ATTEMPTED
TRAIN WRECK
Broken Rail is Discovered and
Special is Flagged in the
Nick of Time.
LOUISA. *Ky., Oct. 13.?Evidence of
a deliberate attempt to wreck the spec
ial train bearing Charles E. Hughes,
tho Republican nominee for president,
on his tour through Kentucky, Thurs
day was discovered juts in thno to
prevent a disaster.
A rail was found to have been brok
en on the point of a curve around a
steep embankment of the Big Sandy
river. The special had already left
Paintsville. The section hands who
made the discovery rushed down the
track and flagged the train.
The rail was broken for a distance
of several inches, the inside flange hav
ing been knocked entirely away.
The part of the rail broken off could
not be found. Train ofTlcials said
that the break appeared to have been
caused by a heavy blow from some in-'
sturaent.
Mr. Hughes carried his campaign
Thursday to the mountains of Ken
tucky and into mining and lumber
towns which no presidential nominee
had ever visited before. His audiences
were composed largely of men and
women who t had traveled miles by
horseback and by muleback to hear
his as he outlined his views on the
maintenance of American rights
abroad.

A marriage license has been issued
to Leonidas Rhodes and Amy Keesy.
ROBINSON DENOUNCES
UNTRUE STATEMENT
That He Had Made an Agree
ment with Others as to the
Governorship.
RONCEVERTE, Oct. 13?Judge
Ira E. Robinson, Republican candi
date for governor. Issued the follow
ing statement here last night when
Informed of the contents of a publi
cation which appeared In the Hunt
ington Advertiser and other Demo
cratic newspapers of the state:
"My attention haB been called to a
publication In the Huntington Ad
vertiser of certain letters purporting
to detail an agreement supposed to
hare been entered Into between cer
tain gentlemen and myself regarding
the governorship.
"I wish to say unhesitatingly that
the statements as published are not
correct, that no agreement as detail
ed has been entered into by me. 1
am willing to submit to the people of
Wert Virginia whether my record an
j a man and official Indicates that 1
am pro no to make such extraordi
nary and Improper agreements.
"I am making no promises but can
faithfully state that In dispensing
patronage the only test will bo ef
' flclency and I shall not ge behind the
primary returns In measuring any
many's political fitness.
"The publication of these lotters
Is merely an effort to divert atten
tion from the Issues of the campaign
In order to aid the Democratic can
didate lor governor. I do not pro
pose to further this purpose or to
gratify the vanity of these gentlemen
by entering Into any controversy with
them. So far as I am concerned this
clotei the matter."
ANOTHER "OLD SCHOOL"
DEMOCRATFOR HUGHES
Well Known Author Awaits Op
portunity to Voice His De
testation of Wilson.
(?FSCIAL TO TH? Tlt-KflMAMl
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.?Another
Democrat of the old school who In
BupportlnK Governor Hughes In tills
campaign Is Krank II. Spearman, the
well known author and writer on econ
omics. Mr. Speannun announces thai
four years ago he and two of his Hons,
his brother and his nephews voted for
Wilson.
"Next month," continues Mr. Spear
man. "three of my sons, my brother,
my nephews, one and all and I my
self. will take a long and watchfully
awaited opportunity to rocord our
tutor detestation of the man and his
policies by voting for Justice Hughes."
The quotation is from a letter writ
ten by Mr. Spearman to ex-Governor
Harmon of Ohio, head of the Woodrow
Wilson College League, in response to
Mr. Harmon's Invitation to Mr. Spear
man to Join that organization. Mr.
Spearman not only declined lo Join the
league but he wrote to former Senator
Theodore B. Burton, president of the
Hughes College league, enrolling him
self and Ills three sons In the highest
league. With his lotter to Senator
Burton Mr. Spearman enclosed a copy
of his letter to Governor Harmon. In
this letter Mr. Spearman reviewed Mr.
Wilson's presidential career from the
appointment of Mr. Bryan to head the
stato department down to "the last
thing he has done In ramming down
the throat of Congress his indefensible
ten hours pay for eight hours work
Adnmnon law."
"It Is difficult to speak with becom
ing restraint of his Mexican record,"
| continues Mr. Spearman. "Mr. Bryan
sought only to Mexlcanlio the currency
of our country; Mr. Wilson has Mex
Icanlxed. so far as ho could, its decent
self respect Mr. Bryan threatened
j only the national purse; Mr. Wilson
has filched our country's good name.
"The cries of the tortured Armenian
Christians moved Mr. Wilson alim'-at to
tears. The cries of tho tortured Mex
ican Christians masked his visage
with that solemn brooding silence to
which we have become so unhappily
accustomed. On the subject of driv
ing Christ out of Mexico, Mr. Wilson
has nothing, not a syllable, to say.
And in every step of his presidential
carecr the American people hare been
met by his mysterious mutterlngs, po
litical undertones, dark Intimations of
Imminent perils and Irritating Insinua
tions and have been left to grope for
truth concerning situations with every
avenue of the administration guarded
to prevent the facts underlying his
policies from becomtng publicly
known.
"Mr. Wilson will wondor next month
why the bnslness men of this country
have presented practically a united
front against him at the pollp, It Is
because of their oontempt for Ills utt?r
helplessness as concerns business
n?eds. For advice on this subject he
has relied on Josephus Daniels; as to
Mexican conditions on John Llnd and
Senor Carranza. In whatever direc
tion we consider Ur. Wilson and his
advisors their efforts appear equally
futile, equally depressing.
"This frank letter 1h due to the fact
that 1 have bottled up ray political
wrath too long, but tlilB appeal to en
roll in behalf of tho present occupant
of tlie White House bos been the straw
that haw broken at the eleventh hour
ray camel's back of silence. Tens of
thousands of DeraocratB like myself
have not changed our positions?the
policies of Mr. Bryan and too many
of Mr. Wilson's arc not and never
have been Democratic."
