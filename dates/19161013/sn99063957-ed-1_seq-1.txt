With Mrs'. Lloyd K Weeks nt the

Christian Aim was at the wheel of the
Chalmers, which was on the left side
of the road and proceeding west on
the Silvertou road.
The machines met with a crash as

Holds That United States Is
Right In Contention War
Must Continue
By Carl W. Ackermau.
(United Press staff correspondent ) '
Dusseldorf, Germany, Oct. .13. Near
ly every big industrial leader in the
Rhine valley industrial center, which
is Germany's Pittsburg, fr.vors ruthless
submarine warfare, regardless of the in
terests of the United States. t
Chancellor Von Bethmnnnllollwog
faces the opposition of the industrial in
terests of both the Rhino-ami Westfal
ian provinces, hot beds of Von Tirpitz
ism. These interests believe that
though they may not Convince the gov
ernment now they will win later. They
arc now centering their hopes of win
ning Field Marshal Von llindenburg to
their side.
"The war must be fought to- a fin
ish," said, the Westfaelische Zeitung,
which fairly represents the sentiment
from the district in this respect. "Eith
er Germany or England must win and
the interests here on the Rhine are
ready to fight until Germany wins."
Directors of Germany's steel trust
and other millionaires in this industrial
country declare unreservedly that Ger
many will not muke pence until Eng
land asks terms. The Rhinelnnd press
is still discussing War Secretary Lloyd
George's statement to the United Press
that tho allies must carry the war to a
"knockout" and they hold that this
statement justifies their contention that
Germany must use every possible weap
on against England. The activities of
the U-5.1 have greatly increased their
faith in the possibilities of unlimited
submarining.
August Thyssen, Germany's Carnegie,
declared in an interview at Homborn-on-Rhine
that since England is still
the great sea power it was necessary for
Germany to operate suomarines along
the Canadian and American coasts to
overcome this advantage.
"It can bo imagined that is uncom
fortable for America, but ij must be
remembered we are at war with Cuuada
and this is one means of ending the
war," said Thyssen. "We can't always
make war as America wants."
"Do you think Germany wants war
with America!" he was asked.
"Never! " waslhe emphatic response.
"First, because we have enemies enough
and second, because in peace timVs our
relations with America are ahvtiys most
friendly nnd we want them to continue
so after the war. We are always sym
pathetic toward America. The word in
terests of both countries will develop
through peace."
Thyssen does not believe nn economic
war will follow the present war.
"We want peace because we desire to
develop our industries in pence, not
war." he said. "A few, who because
they manufacture niumuuition want a
long war, do not speak for Germany be
cause we do not intend to live after the
war by manufacturing ammunition."
Thyssen is- nn intimate friend of the
kaiser. Before the'wur he often met
Judge Gary of the United States Steel
corKration and his sou, Fritz, studied
the Pittsburg steel and coal industries
He is one of the few industrial lenders
who oppose Admiral Von Tirpitz.
Long Ssarch for Wife
Ends in Portland
Portland, Ore.. Oct. 13. Tony Silvas'
long pursuit of his wife and the man
with whom she fled, from Fresno, Cal.,
is ended today. He found the woman
in Portland. The man had gone.
More than a year ago Silvas declares
his wife eloped with Steve Diemnn, a
Greek- She took their little daughter'
Fmma and their marriage certificate.
Silvas followed all through the west,
narrowly missing the fugitives in Al
bany, Ore., recently.
Detectives discovered Mrs. Silvas in
Portlund. When apprehended she hail
two children instead of only one und
she was defiant. "I go away," she
snapped, "because Tony won't work.
Steve is a good man."
Steve, however, is nnfoug the. miss
ing and the police want him. Statutory
charges are being prepared by the dis
trict attorney. Silvas will attempt to
recover his child Emmn by having the
jnvf nile court declare her mother an un
fit custodian-

Inability to Carry Supplies
Gives Rise to Suspicion of
Secret Help
TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT
VIOLATING NEUTRALITY
Vessels Might Be Supplying
Submarines Now On At
lantic Coast
Washington, Oct. 13. Suspicion that
a belligerent government might bo
maintaining a naval base on tho Atlan
tic coast of this country, caused the
sudden dash to sea of destroyers from
Newport yesterday, Secretary Daniels
said today.
Admiral Mayo, commanding tho At
lantic fleet ordered the ships out yester
day. They will scour the coast as far
north as Eastport, Maine, near :he
Cnnadian border, searching for pos
sible secret submarine bases or wireless
stations. I
"We have no reason to believe any
belligerent is maintaining a base on this
short," Daniels snid. ."During the last
year, however, whenever there has
been a report, or even a possibility that
a belligerent was maintaining a sub
marine base on this side, we have sent
destroyers out to search for it."
Since the arrival of the 17-53. Daniels
Enid, there have been iimuy reports,
particularly in newspapers, that some
belligerent was maintaining a naval
base here. Daniels has received let
ters, it was admitted, suggesting such
a possibility. Tho order for tho sudden
trip to sea though, was made by Ad
miral Mayo on his own initiative.
While the department has no informa
tion on the point the suddenness of tho
departures of tho destroyers gave rise
to tho reports that the Newport naval
men had been "tipped" to the loca
tion of a naval base-
The possible base or bases is not be
lieved to be on land. Instead, accord
ing to official tips here, supplying may
be done by ship masters from Canada,
tho United States and Spain, while uon
slnkable rafts with oil barrels attached
muy be floated out to belligerent war
ressels. The tip here is tllat these sup
plies have been Bent to German sub
marines. One official guardedly admitted his
belitf that there will be more sub
marine raids next month.
It was also snid that agents of the
treasury and justice departments are co
operating in the search. Tho justice do-

By Henry Wood
(United Press Btaff correspondent)
With the French armies on tho Som
nie Front, Oct. 13. TJic Germans have
withdrawn their heavy guns from one
and a half to five miles behind thoir
Sammo front, Anglo-French aviators
have discovered on recent flights,
The withdrawal was ordered to save
the pieces from capture. In tho recent
dashes of ailed infantry into the Ger
man lines many heavy guns have been
taken before the Germans had an op
portunity to withdraw them. Tho Ger
mans now have "100 guns opposing the
French and British on the Sommc front
compared with 2500 guns they used in
the attack ou Verdun. Of this number
six hundred are south of the Somme,
facing the French and 050 oppose tho
French advance north of the Sommo.
The British are opposed by 850 Ger
man pieces.
Since the allied offensive began moro
than 500 German, guns have been cap
tured. . Italian Drive Fals .
Berlin, Oct. 13. The Itnliari drive
on the Isunzo, launched for the purpose
of relieveing Austrian pressure on Ru
mania!, has utterly failed in its pur
pose, said Vienna dispatches today.-
The Anstrinus have blocked ropeat
eu Italian assaults without summoning
a single regiment from any other front
it was stated. General Cadorna has
failed to make an inportant gain though
he wasted ammunition lavishly in eight
days of bombardment that preceded the
assault.
British and Serbian attacks in Mace
donia, probably for the urpose.of draw
ing off Bulgarian troops from the Ru
manian front have met with a similar
fate. The Bulgars withdrew at a few
places but everywhere maintained thoir
fortified lines.

CLAIM HAVE RIGHT
TO CENSOR MAILS
French and English Reply to
American Note Are
Identical
Washington, Oct. 13. Stato depart
ment officials are today studying the
identical French and British reply to
tho American protest of more than four
months ago against certain features of
the allied, mail censorship. Tho notes,
written in French, were delivered to
the department lute yesterday. Arrange
ments are being mado for their simul
taneous publication in tho near future
by the British, French and American
governments.
Although neither department offi
cials nor allied diplomats would discuss
the contents of the reply, it is learned
on good authority that the two govern
ments, taking issue with American con
tentions, maintain:
That they have a right to censor
mnil. . -
That thev are justified in forcing
noutrul ships into British and French
portB to censor mail. -
That they have a right to seize unit
ed States postnl , money orders of
"enemy "..destination.
That because all or tne nciiigercnrs
did not ratify Tho Hague conventions,

Department Is Investigating
Charges of Conspiracy hi
Many Cities
Washington, Oct. 13. Charges ot
widespread election fraud conspiracies
in Cincinnati, Cleveland nnd Columbus,
Ohio; Detroit and other Michigan cities,
s vcrnl Indiana cities, including Indian
apolis nnd Terer Haute and in Pennsyl
vania, West Virginia and Colorado, are
under investigation todny by the depart
ment of justice. The department hopes
to dispose of the cases beforo tho com
ing election.
Briefly, illegal registration, coloniza
tion and proposed illegal voting at the
November election, nre included in the
charges. The department has been in
formed it is planned to tnko voters
from one stato to another to use them
in elections.
Charges made to the department, it
wus admitted, have been on cxcollent
authority. In many cases they wcr
made by voters' leugues and citizens'
associations. In some instances it is un
derstood direct charges were mado thai
certain political organizations have plan
ned frauds; in other cases, that frauds
of past years were to bo repeated-
Klection fraud cases in Denver, Colo.,
Pennsylvania and West Virgianiu, it
was said, concern past cases. Tho Den
ver investigation has to do with the
Colorado Fuel uud Iron company inves
tigation of some months ago. Tho West
Virginia investigation is a continuation
of u guneraMirube into West Virgiuuiu
politics which has already figured in
the state courts. The Pennsylvania in
vestigation involves alleged campaign
contributions by liquor interests, which
attracted widespread attention some
months ago. These last cases arc un
derstood to be about ready for trial.
Department of justice attorneys snid
today they would make every effort to
prevent the frauds which, it is alleged,
aro to be attempted in the November
elections. In uli cases where changes
have been made, depurtinent agents uru
trying to "cleun up" the cases before
instead of after elections.
