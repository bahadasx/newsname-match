HEAR COL. ROOSEVELT
AT CORBIN WEDNESDAY,
OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS BEING
SPENT BY' COUNTIES ON EASTERN
BRANCH OF THE DIXIE HIGHWAY
Through the Mountains North of Knoxville Direc
tors Enthusiastic Over Prospects and Forsee
Completion of the Eastern Branch Within
Twelve Month at the Latest Work Going on in
Every County Along the Line-
On the preliminary inspection
trip made over the Dixie highway
between Knoxville and Lexing
ton, Kv., by President Allison.
Directors Richard Hardy and A.
F. Sanford last week, over one
million dollars worth of road work
was found by them to be under
construction through the difficult
mountainous section beginning
with the Union county line and
running through Union and Clai
borne counties, Tennessee, thence
through Hell, Knox, Laurel,
Rockcastle and Madison counties,
Kentucky to Richmond, Ky., from
which point the roads are in fine
condition to Cincinnati. The
bulk of the money is going direct
ly on the Dixie highway.
The party were accompanied
by Mr. John Lovell, of the Patten
Hotel. Chattanooga, and Mr.
Carter Lynch,, also of that city.
As a result of the very large
road work now under construc
tion it was decided by the direc
tors that it would be inadvisable
to hold any large dedication trip
this fall. At many places along
theroute detours around construc
tion work are necessary, some
portions have not yet been reach
ed by the contractors and one or
two short gaps have not as yet
been let, which makes automo
bile transportation a dfficult mat
ter at present.
It was felt by the directors that
to make the dedication trip at
the present time would be con
strued by the public that the
route was ready for easy travel,
which is not the case; however,
First National Bank Pig
Wins First
State
e.
Word was received to-day from the United States
Department of Agriculture at Lexington, Kentucky,
that the First National Bank Pig, belonging to Elmer
Faulkner, had won the first prize in the Boys Pig
Club Contest at the State Fair. Out of eighty-four
entries from every part of the State this pig won
first prize. The First National Bank pigs had al
ready won the first and fourth prizes for the best six
months boar in the State. Now the Bank's pig takes
the first prize for the best pig in the State without
regard to age.
This prize is $20,00 in cash, two years tuition at
the State College and 100 lbs. of best pig feed.
The bank officials are proud of the record made
by these pigs. Knox County people can get there
when thgy try.

they were more than gratified
with the immense amount of work
going on and in sight, which
practically assures the completion
of the eastern branch of the Dixie
highway to Cincinnati by next
fall at the extreme latest, and
they believe that one year hence
the run from Cincinnati to Knox
ville, can be satisfactorily made
over a surfaced road in two days'
time.
At all points they found Dixie
Highway enthusiam and appre
ciation of the value of this thru
road and assurances that each
county would do its part.
Begining in Union county Ten
nessee, where $100,000 is being
spent, the party found re-surfacing
under wav between Knox
1 county line and Maynardville and
1 grading beyond Maynardville to
the Claiborne county line, pro
bably one half completed and a
grading crew on the work. The
piers for a new bridge over the
Clinch river at Millers Ferry are
completed. County Judge Geo.
Taylor and Road Commissioner
Thaddeus Smith say that Union
county will deliver her road to
the Dixie highway completely
surfaced.
On reaching Claiborne county
line, they found the grading com
pleted from that point to Taze
well with the exception of a gap
of three or four miles which has
been under litigation but recent
ly settled, and which will now be
pushed forward. The recent big
flood in Claiborne county did
about $2,000 worth of damage to

the finished grade on Barren
Creek which makes difficult go
ing in spots at present. This
side of Tazewell three or four
miles have already been surfaced.
Between Tazewell and Cumber
land Gap the grading is nearly
finished and there are also a fv
miles of surfacing completed.
The directors interviewed Road
Commissioner G. V. Montgom
ery at Tazewell and County Judge
Morrison at Cumberland Gap,
who assured them that the $S0,
000 set apart for the Dixie high
way would undoubtedly take care
of Claiberno's part.
In Bell county Kentucky, be
tween Middlesboro and Pineville
the grading is all completed and
it is one of the finest pieces of
work ever seen by any of the
party. This is also partially sur
faced with a wide macadam road
and a rocking crew is now at
work. The scenery along this
road is magnificent.
At Pineville the directors met
County Judge T. J. Asher, to
whom credit is due for putting
this magnificent road through
Bell county. This county has ap
propriated $i")0,0()() already and
will use more than this amount.
Judge Asher assured the direct
ors that Well county would bo on

of road through tho mountain

How Catarrh Is Contracted.
Mothers are sometimes so
thoughtless as to neglect the
colds which their children con
tract. The inflammation of the
mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and the child
has chronic catarrh, a disease
that is seldom cured and that
may prove a life's burden. Many

, Dr. W. C. Black, President of
Board of Education was the first
one of its members to honor
each of the rooms with a visit.
We were glad to welcome him
and invite him and all tho other
trustees to come at any time
The recepti -u . nail,
one of the best methods for dis
cipline, in existence was started
the first of September. Prof.
Oldfield had seen the method
tried at Green briar Military
School, West Va., and knew of
its merit. If a student is tardy,
1.0 linuient or for any misbe
havior, a teacher may place that
student in study hall for any
number of periods she or he
thinks the student should be
punished. A period is 10 minutes.
The teachers take turns keeping
study hall for a week, every
afternoon from J to 1. If a stu
dent due in study hall fails to
report, his periods are doubled.
This is proving to be most ben
eficial to the school.
Last Friday oer 100 people
