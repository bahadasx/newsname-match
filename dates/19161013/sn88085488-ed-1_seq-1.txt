If the lack of interest taken in the :
offices to be filled at the city elec-!
tlon of this fall can be taken as a ;
reliable criterion the above three cit- i
liens are the only ones who are will- j
Ing and desirous of serving the ctly
In an official capacity. The time!
limit for the filing of notices of can-1
didacy for city offices expired last'
Saturday evening, and the three can-1
didates named above were the only
ones to announce themselves as can-1
didates and insure the placing of
' their names on the primary election :
ballots through payment of the fil- j
ing fee. The primary election will
be held Tuesday, November 7, the
same day as the general county and
state election, and the names of the
three candidates for the paid posi
tions will be the only ones to appear
on the primary ballots.
With a mayor and five councilmen
to be elected, the dearth of candi
dates assumes a somewhat serious
aspect, and it is probable that a gen
eral caucus will be called for the I
evening of the primaries to name a
fall ticket. After the expiration of
the time for filing notices of candi- i
dacy the caucus method is the only
one open, and unless Pullman wants ;
to find herself without a govern- j
ment this action must be taken.
Under the new state laws govern
ing municipalities this fall's city elec
tion will be the last for two years, I
and the mayor will be elected for
that period of time, the councilmen
to serve two and four years.
J. P. Duthle, councilman from the |
Third ward, has two years yet to:
serve, the only other holdover being I
j ha Nye, representing the Second I
I ward, with the same length of time
remaining of his term. Two coun-j
cilmen are to be elected from the ':
First ward, one for two years, to fill i
out the unexpired term of Council-1
man J. N. Scott, who forfeited his j
office through removal to another 1
*ard, and another for four years.!
Councilmen for four years are to be i
elected from both the Second and I
Third wards and a councilman-at- i
krge, to serve two years, Is also to
be named. j
To be legal a general caucus to se-;
lect candidates must be held on the
day of the primary election. After
the candidates so named pay the re-;
Wired filing fee and certify their 1
nominations at the caucus they be
come eligible to compete in the gen- !
eral election and their names will
appear on the ballots. '
The imperative necessity for filing j
toe municipal ticket by caucus was j
"ought to the attention of the;
chamber of commerce at its Tuesday
meeting, it was stated that the city '
8 getting more and more deeply .in ;

Defense
!' — :::■!
1 For the first time in seven years I
I the Pullman high school eleven went |
down to defeat before a county team
i last Saturday at Tekoa, when the Te- ;
I koa high school team hid a man on
; the side lines and slipped a long for-!
, ward pass to him which resulted in j
a touchdown, and afterward kicked i
; goal. |
After the kickoff the game start-,
led out with Pullman in possession J
; of the ball on her own 25-yard line. j
j Making yardage at every down, they i
j worked the ball to the middle of the j
| field, where they lost the oval on a j
j fumble. After this the ball see
i sawed back and forth. Pullman los-!
I ing on fumbles or intercepted for- j
i ward passes and Tekoa losing on fail- i
ure to make yardage.
I The second quarter opened with a
j rush. C.urts. captain and quarter for ,
i Tekoa, laid out on the side lines and |
'received a long forward pass from
(Buttons, speeding across the goal
line for a touchdown. He then kicked
I goal.
Pullman kicked to Gurts of Tekoa,

lof the field. Here Tekoa fumbled
and Pullman recovered. Using line;
plunges and short end runs they
' marched down the field, forcing Cap

missed goal, and the score stood 7-6 ■
i in favor of Tekoa. I
The third quarter opened up with j
j hard playing on both sides, the ball j
( see-sawing up and down the field.)
During the last quarter the Pull
man team showed its mettle when, |
with but two feet to go over the line
and three downs to make it with, Te
, koa lost the ball on downs. Twice
, during the last half, Pullman had a,
chance to win, once on a long end j
run and once on a forward pass but,
both times the ball was called back
for off side.
Although outweighed from five to j
10 pounds to the man, Pullman made!
the majority of Its gains through the
toe, falling down on her forward

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY. OCTOBER 13. 1916
BANKERS ¥ FARMERS SPEND 3
TWO IIS AT STATE COLLEGE
I
Visitors Busy from Time of Arrival=~"Miitual
Confidence" Promoted—Convention will
be Held Annually.
"Mutual confidence" was the key
note of the first annual Bankers-
Farmers convention he-id at Wash
ington State Friday and Saturday.
October 6 and 7. After 350 bankers
and farmers from all parts of the
state, ranging from Seattle to Spo
kane, from Elwaco to Colville, had
been banqueted, lectured, and enter
tained together, after they had
laughed together and had considered
the agricultural problems, there was
evidenced an increased feeling of
confidence and understanding.
The delegates gathered In front of
Bryan Hall early Friday afternoon to
review the prize stock from the col
lege farm. At 2:30 the convention
was called to order by E. E. Flood,
chairman of the bankers' association
committee on agricultural and voca
tional education. He briefly out
lined the purpose of the convention
and its chief problem: the great need
of both bankers and farmers to know
their mutual difficulties. Ralph C.
Stacy of Tacoma, president of the
bankers' association, explained to
the evident satisfaction of all pres
ent, the provisions and workings of
the new farm land bank law. He
gave the assurance that the sectional
bank for the Northwest would un
doubtedly come to Spokane. Sen
ator W. H. Paulhamus of Sumner ex
plained In detail some of the co-oper
ative ventures that he had inaugur
ated in the Puyallup valley. He
showed how the farmer could make
more use of borrowed money by cit
ing the fact that the Sumner-Puy
allup Fruit Growers association did
an annual business of over a million
dollars almost entirely on borrowed
money.
Thomas B. Hill, editor of the
North Yakima Herald, gave some
pointed examples of how the farmer
has copied the dishonest practices of
his brother in business. Regent E.
T. Coman told of the boys' club work
in Spokane, and urged more co-oper
ation between the farmer and the
business man. Mr. H. R. Smith,
formerly of the U. of Minnesota, and
now live stock expert of the Farmers
National bank of St. Paul, took the
place on the program of Louis W.
Hill and spoke at length on the
wealth of certain stock raising sec
tions of the middle west as compared
with the average communities in the
same sections. President Holland, in
his address of welcome, outlined the
policy and possibilities of Washing
ton State, and showed the advantage
of co-operating with the college.
After a short intermission, the
platform was cleared and the visitors
witnessed two fast boxing bouts and
two exciting wrestling matches.
The dinner Friday evening given
by the Pullman Chamber of Com
merce, at which 350 were present,
and the luncheon for 250 given Sat
urday noon by the college, were
planned, served, and prepared by the
women of the home economics de
partment
Friday evening the bankers and
farmers listened with interest to the
musical program, in which excellent
numbers were given by the college
glee club, Mrs. Ina Wright Herbst,
Dr. E. A. Evans, and the college or
chestra. Dr. Evans responded with
three greatly appreciated encores; an'

A totally unexpected, but very
much enjoyed feature of the enter
tainment was tin' informal dance
given by Dean Rhoda M. White and
tho young women of Stevens hall at j
the close of the musical program of
the evening.
The Washington cadets gave an ex
hibition drill and sham battle which
was attended by many of the visitors
at 8:30 Saturday morning.
The Saturday morning session of
the convention was presided over by j
George W. Peddycord, president of
the Bank of Colville. Master of the
State Grange C. B. Kegley created
considerable comment by advocating
that the surplus school funds of the
state should be loaned out on second
farm mortgages. O. M. Plummer of
the Portland Union Packing company
recommended the work being done j
by Mr. Newblll in the boys' and girls'
club work. The improvement of
home life on the farm was urged j
by W. D. Vincent, vice presi
dent of the Old National bank of Spo- ;
kane. Other speakers were Mr. Benz,
the Toppenlsh potato king, and W.
S. McCrea, president of the Spokane
Chamber of Commerce, while the
closing talk of the morning was given
by the president of the board of re
gents, Wm. A. Ritz, who ■ expressed
his appreciation of the interest i
shown in the college by the visitors.
Following the morning program
the bankers and farmers watched the
varsity-alumni football game, after
which they took an auto trip over the '
college farm. j
Although this is the second con- ■
vention of its kind ever held in the !
United States, it proved so successful |
that it is to be an annual affair at j
Washington State. ■

J. J, Vanßruggen this week pur- j
chased the 260-acre tract two miles j
south of Pullman belonging to J. M.
Atkins, through Hazen & Hartley.'
The price paid was $27,000, which j
includes the crop. The place is well
improved and Mr. Vanßruggen plans
to make it his home, using his "jit- ;
ney" to bring him to Pullman to]
oversee his business here. Mr. Van
Bruggen just recently disposed of i
his farm near Moscow. His transfer j
of affections from Moscow to Pull
man marks him as a man of intelli- j
gence.
WILL TALK MEETING PLACE i
The question of providing a suit-
I able meeting place for the boys of
the high school was considered at the
meeting of the chamber of commerce ,
Tuesday and a committee, headed by !
President F. C. Forrest, was appoint- ,
ed to ascertain the desires and plans j
of the high school heads In regard to
th" proposed action. The city hall
was suggested as a suitable placo for
the purpose, but It Is not known
whether or not it could be •secured.
The abolishment of the secret clubs [
under the recent edict of the school
board was the cause of the action.

Do the farmers of Whitman county
i need the services of a county agricul-
I tural expert such as is employed by ■
(some 1", counties of the state? Many
members of the Pullman Chamber ■ I j
'Commerce believe that an agricultur- j
j al expert would result in great g )•>,!
', to the farming class of the county,'
while others are of the opinion that
! the close proximity of the Whittle;")
'farmers to the State College am! the.;
vast amount of bulletin literature
and information available precludes
! the necessity of the employment of i
j a farm expert to instruct and advise'
I the soil tillers. The difference of
| opinion resulted in an interesting
i discussion, pro and con, at the meet
i
ting of the chamber of commerce j
Tuesday.
The question presented Itself]
I when, following the statement by'
I Bruce Lampson, county leader of j
i boys' and girls' clubs that he would I
1 not be at the head of the county club j
' work next year, it was suggested that
| the employment of a county agricul
turist, who could, as a part of his
official duties, oversee the club work
would solve the problem very satis
factorily.
After several Influential members
lof the chamber had relieved them
selves of the opinions, and there was
; good argument on both side, the
1 matter was left In the hands of a
committee, who were Instructed to
confer with State Leader T. J. New
! bill, Prof. Thornber, head of the ex
; tension department, and others.
Milton J. Newhouse, a graduate
of the State College and at present
J connected with college work, was
suggested as a most desirable man,
for county agriculturist. One big ad
vantage of a county agriculturist
I would be the co-operation and assist-
I ance that could be given the club
work by State Leader Newblll, who
j ls confined to those counties where
an agriculturist Is employed under
J federal act.
The committee, after conferring
with the college and government au
thorities, will report back to the
chamber, when It is probable that
recommendations will be made for
the selection of a county club leader
1 to replace Mr. Lampson.
Mr. Lampson read his report on
club work to the chamber, and the;
great good accomplished by the
movement was evident In every Item i
of the report. |

Dear Sir:
Your request for co-operation in
| securing data relative to an examina
tion of the Columbia, Snake and
l Clearwater rivers received and beg
! to offer the following information in
j relation to a point located between
Almota and Wawawai on Snake river
known as Log Cabin Island:
; It is very centrally located in the
' best part of eastern Washington and
near the best part of northern Idaho.
This point has Interfered with nav
igation of the Snake ever since its In
spection and the government has ex
pended frequently large amounts to
keep the rapids open for navigation
In ordinary water stages for very
flat bottomed steamers. By placing
a dam near the lower part of the Is
land and locks cm the north, the Is
land would give protection in ex
treme floods to both locks and ship
ping.
We have no data as to the fall at
this point, but it occurs to us as be
ing sufficient to develop a largo
amount of power, In fact, the largest
amount at any centrally located Im
provement for navigation on the
Snake river.
I will undertake to give you the
counties Joining, the distance to the
nearest point to those that are men
tioned that do not Join, the principal
towns and distance from this point,
ascertaining It by measuring by using
scale of miles on a map of the state
of Washington published by Arthur
Capper on an air line from point to
point.

given by the stato board of equaliza
tion and tho amount of acres in each
