To the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
jrithin that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.
