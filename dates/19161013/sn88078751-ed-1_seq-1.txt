The United States Government To
Continue Investigation
Washington, Oct: 12. As a result of
too confereneo botween President W1I
on and Secretary Lansing at Long
Branch, N. J., It was stated authori
tatively thai! no evidence of the break
ing of Germany's promises to t'jo Unit
cd States "uad been discovered so far
In connection with tho submarine ac
tivities off the American coast last
Sunday, but that tho American govern
ment will continue its Investigations
ond will watch very closely any repe
tition of the attacks.
Administration olllclals apparontly
fcar that difficulties may result ir Ger
man submarine warfaro Is carried out
on a larse scale on this side of the Afc
iantlc, and that therefore It is necetr
eary for tho ijovornnient to seek all
ftvUs obtainable. .
btrauso lit this fear, it was thought
probaulo that means will bo found for
discovering whether Germany intend?
to content herself with tho damage
done last Sunday or will continue sub
marine warfaro on thl ulde of the At
lantic. bfflclal3 heio expect that tho reports
from Rear Admiral Knight, which will
bo based on tho statements of officers
on tho relief flotilla of American de
stroyers that was at tho eceno of the
raid off Nantucket, will be ready ror
consideration within a few days. It is
emphasized that the government is
making ovcry effort to complete its In
quiry as soon as possible, but that 11
wants to avoid a nasty or ill-advised
decision In so Important a matter.
Whether the German commander
took proper caro for tho safety of the
persons be put into small boats from
tho attacked vessels Is a question in
olvlng points on which officials be
Uoyo thcro Is no clear precedent, and
en which a decision by the United
States might approximate a precedent.
at least so far as concerns any further
submarine operations Germany may
contemplate on .this side, of tho At
lantic , , " " -
Before any, po'Iey is 'determined
upon it Is .spotted that the opinion
of the neutrality board, created at tho
boerinnln? of the war to advlso the
state department Jn regard to such
questions, wilt bo consulted,
Considerable interest centers on the
continued Jsilciico ojf the allied embas
sies Agslin it was stalod. -positively
nt tho 3tate 'donartment that no repre
sentations' of any sort had tyecn re
ceived frbm the ,allles as a result of
tho Xf-n3's visit to Newport or her,
dopredatlons oft tho American coaot.
