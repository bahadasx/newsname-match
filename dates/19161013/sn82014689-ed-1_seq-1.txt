NUMBER 34
FEW SURPRISES IN
PRIMARY ELECTION
Harry Baldwin Leads Entire Ticket Joseph Levi
Noses Enos Vincent Out For Sixth Place
On Republican Representative Ticket
There were but few surprise in the
results of the primary election on
Maui, and the only close contest was
between Enos Vincent and Levi
Joseph for the sixth place on the
Republican representative ticket.
Vincent lost out. by a few more than
seventy votes and Joseph took the
last place on the Republican ticket
by that margin.
Vincent's total was helped out great
ly by the vote he secured in Kalaupa
pa settlement where he was given over
a hundred votes. Even Antone Tavares,
an old favorite there, received only
about eigthy votes from the penned-up
Molokal voters. This was Vincent's
first try for election and he received
773 votes. Some of the seven men he
defeated received less than 300 votes.
Ed. Waiaholo led the Republican
representative ticket with 1062 votes,
with Tavares second with 1017. John
Walsh was third man with a total of
934. Walsh's big vote was not a sur
prise to his friends and those who had
closely followed his campaign, al
though his big vote did startle some of
the Hawaiian politicians, who had
claimed that if he was nominated he
would be the sixth man on the ticket.
Walsh feels that he would have sec
ured from 200 to 300 more votes if
the balloting hhd taw y ea i John
Brown Jr., received 867 votes, Manuel
Gomes Paschoal, 881 and Levi Joseph,
847.
In the delegate race, Abe Loulsson
only secured seventy-nine votes while
his opponent Kuhio Kalanianaole got
a total of 1328 votes. Link McCand
less received 396 votes on this island.
Harry Baldwin, candidate for nom
ination as one of the Republican
senators from this island led the
entire ticket at the primary voting.
His total of votes was 1421, ninety
three more votes than secured by
Prince Kuhio on Maui.
Dr. Raymond, the Democratic candi
date, received sixty-six more votes
than the second Republican candidate,
George P; Cooke. Raymond's total
was 879. Cooke got 793 votes. The
contest was closer between Cooke and
Raymond than was expected by the
supporters of Democratic candidate,
some of whom had confidently expect
ed the Bourbon candidate to get more

SUPERVISORS PROVIDE
FOR ROAD MAINTENANCE
The long sought for appropriation
for the oiling of the pali road to La
haina has finally been passed by the
board of supervisors. The measure
was passed as a "maintenance" one,
which means that oil will be placed
on the Lahaina road as often as Coun
ty Engineer Cox thinks is necessary.
ProviEion was made also . for the
macadamizing and oiling of Vineyard
street and for the rebuilding of the
Kehel road with gravel. Initial plans
were approved for the starting of a
new waterworks at Kaupakalua.

than 1000 votes. As a result of the
primary election the Raymond sup
porters are not so confident that the
Molokal candidate will be defeated at
the November election.
There were a number of odd fea
tures about the balloting for' Ray
mond and Cooke. Several precincts
on Molokal gave the Maui man a
majority of the votes cast, while
Cooke managed to get big totals in
parts of Maui where it was thought
that Raymond was exceptionally
strong.
The race for the second Maul sen
atorship at the November election is
believed to be the only probable con
test by the local politicians. They
say the Raymond-Cooke contest is
bound to be close, with no more
certainty now aa to the outcome than
there is at present in the presidential
irace between Hughes and Wilson.
Republicans declare that the De
mocrats will not be able to elect a
candidates. The Democrats are hard
ly more optimistic, although they
maintain that Manuel Picanco will
make a hard fight for the sixth place.
Herbert Wade
Strong Witness
Coast Papers Tell How Alleged Dyna
miter Was Convicted Through Tes
timony Of Haiku SchoolPrincipal
He Was Able To Identify Warren
K. Billings
Herbert A. Wade, principal of the
Haiku, Maul, school, proved an im
portant witness tn the sensational
bomb plot case in San Francisco,
which resulted in the conviction of
Warren K. Billings.
News has come from the coast that
at the trial of Billings, the bomb-plot
suspect, Wade identified Billings as a
man he saw In a San Francisco dental
office which figured prominently in
the police investigations.
Wade told of visiting the dental of
fices on the second floor at 721 Mar
ket street on July 22. His testimony
in brief was as follows:
"I was at the street doorway," said
Wade, "looking at the porcelain teeth
in the exhibit case and just about to
go up to get my teeth fixed when
Billings passed me and went up the
stairs. I noticed him particularly, be
cause ft occured to me that he had
slipped in ahead of me and would
beat me to the dentist. As I did not
want to have to wait, I did not go
up. I am thererore positive that this
man was Billings. He carried a dark,
reddish-brown suit case about 20 in
ches long, shorter and wider than the
ordinary."
On cross-examination Wade fixed
the time at about 1 p. m. He admit
ted that he could not recognize or
Identify anyone else who passed him
there, but insisted that his thought
that Billings had beaten him to the
dentist's chair made him take careful
note of the man. He saw two others
attempt to go up, he said, but could
not describe them. One of the, he
said, might have been Mrs. Mooney,
but he could not be sure.
Wade described the attire of Bil
lings as a dark gray suit with a dark
soft bat. Asked to state the height
of the man he described as Billings,
Wade replied that he was about 5 feet
5 inches.
Raymond Resigns
Three Positions
Dr. J. H. Raymond, Democratic
candidate for election as senator from
this Island, has tendered his resigna
tion to Governor L. Plnkham for all
the territorial positions he holds at
the present time. The resignations
are to take place on November 1st.
This action was taken by Dr. Ray
mond to permit him to comply with
the territorial law and make his elec
tion to a territorial office legal.
Dr. Raymond had three positions to
resign from: that of Maul supervisor,
member of the Maui Loan Fund Com
mission and as chairman of the ter
ritorial land board. There are no ap
plicants for appointment as super
visor to fill the vacancy created by
Dr. Raymond, so far as is known. It
is usually the political rule, it is said,
to leave the positions open, where the
resignations are made to comply with
a technical requirement, until after
the election is held.
In case Dr. Raymond is not elected
he will likely be reappointed to the
three positions, it is thought.
Wailuku Church
Has Celebration
Union's Fiftieth Anniversary Com'
memorated Dy Services And Festi
vals For Three Days Many Min
isters And Congregation Attend
The fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of the Wailuku Union Church
was celebrated with fitting ceremonies
on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The
first service, which was largely at
tended, was held at half past three on
Sunday at which a sermon dealing
with the work of the church was de
livered by the minister upon the sub
ject, "The Inheritance of Faith." Mrs.
Geo. N. Weight, Jr. was installed as
deaconness, while nine new members
were received into the organization.
On Sunday evening Rev. P. Judd of
the Hawaiian Board, Ensign Puck of
the Salvation Army, Rev. J. Chas. VT4
liers, rector of the Church of the Good
Shepherd, and Rev. Frank S. Scudder,
the superintendent of the Japanese
work of the Hawaiian Board, were the
speakers. A liberal offering for the
Church Building Society was taken at
the Sunday services.
A most interesting meeting for the
ministers and evangelists of central
and west Maui was held on Monday,
both morning and afternoon. In the
evening the church was crowded with
people who had accepted the invita-
tion to the services. Addresses were

BOSTON RED
TAKE WORLD SERIES
Fifth Game And Championship Won By Splendid
Pitching Of Shores Brooklyn
Gets Only One Run
NEW YORK, October 12 With a score of four to one, the Boston
Red Socks won the fifth game and the worlds' base ball championship
today from the Brooklyn team, after a hard fought battle in which there
was a decided reverse for the Dodgers following the first inning.
Shore, the Boston pitcher, held the Dodgers down to three hits
and the one run. After the first-run, the "Hop Slinger" was master
of the game until the end of the ninth inning.
The only score of the Brooklyn team was made in the first inning.
The National team was again weak and unsteady in its fielding. By
winning the game today the Red Socks repeated their former feat
of winning their game after being behind.
But after the first inning, Shore gained his control and confidence
and the early lead of his opponents for the championship and the world
series' money melted quickly away.
More than 42,000 excited base ball fans saw the concluding game of
the series.
Brooklyn only took one game in the series and Boston four.
NEW YORK, October 13 Liners which have been waiting here
for orders have decided to dare a repetition of the German submarine
raid and have sailed for British ports. Adriatic, Ilellig and Olav have
left here with 700 passengers. The vessels left the harbor with no
lights show ing. A few American citizens are aboard the ship.
The Kingston reports her safety to New, York agents, with the
statement that the vessel was never near Nantucket.
INDIANNArOLIS, October 12 President Wilson declared in a
ppeech here that he wants no loose talking. He tells convention that
public speakers should put up facts or shut up.
LONDON, October 13 "Mad" King Otto of Bavaria is dead, after
an illness of long duration.
Reports say that Greek rebellion is growing and that the rebels are
marching against Bulgarians.
BAYONNE, October 13 One person was killed in strike rioting
here and twenty others hurt. The refinery sacks were set afire.

More Room Is
County Show Cry
Demands Of Exhibitors Shows Need
Of More Space Urgent At Every
Meeting Of Maui County Fair Cem
mittees FIRE WORKS TO
WIND-UP FAIR
Fire works Is to be the final
feature of the Maui County Fair
on Saturday evening, December
2nd, according to a decision
reached by the executive com
mittee at the meeting held
yesterday. The committeemen
were all agreed that fire works
for the last evening would be
appreciated and it was decided
to cable at once for a large sup
ply. The fire works will likely
be set off from the sand hills on
the Kalmlui side of the fair
grounds.
At every successive meeting of the
general Maui County Fair committee
the cry for more space grows more
clamorous and plans have to be re
arranged to suit the demands for ad
ditional room. When t he ten-acre base
ball diamond site was first secured the
question of ground room for the fair
was thought to be settled once for all,
but a meeting or two afterward it
was declared that the base ball
grounds would not hold all the ex
hibits. Then plans were made to get and
use the addition to Market street lead
ing to the ball park. Again the ques
tion was brought up at another meet
ing and It was moved to secure the use
of the Alexander House gymnasium,
the Chinese church and another build
ing which are contiguous to the ball
park.
The familiar question was again
raised at the fair meeting held yes
terday and the suggestion was made
and wl'.l be followed out that no auto
mobiles be allowed to park in the
grounds. To provide room for the
autos the old base ball grounds will
be utilized and probably all the other
vacant lots near the park.
The cry for space is not an Idle
one, and effort to secure room would
not be made if it were not for the
many exhibits that are being listed
and the great amount of space re
quired by the larger ones. In the
livestock division alone, it is said that
100 stal's, at the lowest estimate will
be needed. At Hilo there were only
about thirty stalls, although this was
one of the most important exhibits of
the Hawaii fair.

Japanese Consul
Visiting Maui
Accompanied by his secretary, R.
Mori, the Japanese consul general for
the Hawaiian Islands, arrived on Maul
last Wednesday night for a personal
investigation of the conditions or the
people of his race on this island.
Consul Mori previously made a Bimilar
visit to Kauai.
Upon his arrival here the consul
was met by a number of prominent
Japanese who since have been escort
ing him about the island. On Wed
nesday evening he was entertained at
a banquet at the Maui Hoteh A big
reception was held in his honor last
night in the old Wailuku mill, so all
the Japanese of the district could meet
him.
lie expects to be on Maui about two
weeks, during which every section of
the island will be visited.
Hawaii Is Growing
In Popularity Fast
W. 0. Aiken, Maui Member Of Promo
tion Committee Writes That Every
one On Mainland Seems Greatly
Interested In The Island
W. O. Aiken of Maul, who represents
this island on the promotion commit
tee, and who is now touring the main
land, has written to friends here con
cerning his trip and winds up with the
fol'owing paragraphs:
"I have seen some fine hotels and
have seen some fine roads. After the
boulewards in California and all
places leading to their beauty spots
and places of amusement, it gives one
a feeling of shame to think of the
road you must pass over to cover the
short distance from Fort street to
Waikiki, famed the world over as the
finest beach and place of amusement
of its kind known." '
With regard to the San Diego expo
sition Mr. Aiken says:
"As a Hawaiian exhibit, what we
have there is not much to speak of,
but as merely a cog in the Pan Pacific,
perhaps is worth while. The exposi
tion is very poorly attended, but it is
a beautiful display and deserves bet
ter of Hawaii.
I attended the show given in the
Hawaiian Village on the Isthmus. I
saw the hula as given there and found
nothing to complain of. The hula was
a modified form of our national dance
and not the disgusting show that it has
been said to be. Only Hawaiians are
now connected with it, and in their
portrayal of 'Old Hawaii,' have not
done so badly. A part-Hawaiian with
his wife and three children two girls
and one boy were the main features.
"I find much interest in Hawaii ev
erywhere, and have had many chances
to exhibit my fine photographs to ad
vantage. Have heard 'Aloha Oe' and
'On the Beach at Waikiki' played in
almost every city we have been in."
GASOLENE SHORTAGE IS
STOPPED BY TANKER ATLAS
By the arrival of the tanker Atlas
yesterday, the shortage of gasolene,
from which motorists and others have
been suffering since last Saturday,
was checked. The arrival of the Hil-
onian early in the week also helped to
increase the local supply. The short
age became marked last Saturday
when the rent automobile men began
offering as much as fifty cents a gallon
for small supplies to carry them over
until a cargo arrived. The tanker
brought a full cargo and it is said
that there is now enough gasolene on
the Island to last for another three
weeks.
The supervisors today granted per
mission to the Maul County Fair coui
mttee to close up the extension of
Market street and use It for exhibits
during the fair dates.

Boys' Fall From
Automobile Fatal
Young Wills Dies From Fractured
Skull Three Days After Being
Thrown From Car Accident
Is Coroner's Verdict
Thrown from an automobile on
which lie was riding to Wailuku last
Saturday night, fourteen-year old
Andrew Wills of Waikapu received a
fractured skull, from which he died
last Wednesday.
Young Wills and four companies of
about the same age were all on a
smal'. roadster. Two were riding in
the Feat, two on the back of the car
and Wills was sitting on the tool box
on the running board of the auto. His
fall from the car was not noticed at
the time it happened by any of the
other hoys, but after they had gone
some distance one of them looked back
Mid saw something lying In the road.
It was then that Wills was missed.
The boys went back and picked him up
and carried him to the hospital. The
fatal nccident happened just on the
outskirts of Wailuku and near the
home of Sheriff Clem Crowell.
What caused Wills to be thrown or
forced from the car is unknown, itf
thouih the theory has been advanced
that he was brushed from the car
while the auto was passing an animal
in the road. Thii theory was not. how
ever, established at the coroners' inr
nuest, which was held to investigate
the nccident.
The coroners' jury composed of M.
C. Ross, J. O. McGulre, Luke Rogers,
George Edwards, Joe do Rego and L.
B. Kaumeheiwa returned a verdict
that the death was caused by an ac
cidental fall from the automobile.
Wills was a large boy, larger than
most of men, and of robust health.
He was an adopted son of A. Gross of
Waikapu. Funeral services for the
interment of the body were held yes
terday. Swimming Meet
Big Success
The swimming meet at the Alex
ander House Gymnasium Tank was a
entirely new feature and was well at
tended by most appreciative specta
tors. The tank was extremely well
lighted by two Immense electric
lamps, loaned by the Wailuku Sugar
Company for the occasion, and by
numerous Japanese lanterns electric
ally lighted and arranged Ln the shape
of a big capital A.
The teams were all in dead earnest
and did their very best work. The
A. H. O. boys scored 23 points as a
gainst 27 points by the High School
Aquatic Club.
The A. H. G. girls' team was the
surprise of the day securing a score of
27 to 13 against the girls of the High
School.
The officers of the meet were as
follows: judges S. Short, D. Town
send, R. Hughes; timers F. Lufkin
and Wm. Chillingworth ; starter A.
Burdick; announcer K. L. Corson.
It is rumored that a return meet will
be asked for soon.
Following the swimming meet the
dance In the Gymnasium proved a
lasting attraction until midnight. A
large part of the success of the dance
was due to the pleasing numbers of
the Gymnasium Orchestra offered.
The proceeds of the meet will help
materially in completing the funds
that are being secured for the build
ing of the tennis courts that are now
well under construction.
Friends of Will. J. Cooper, manager
and editor of the Maui News, and Mrs.
Cooper, have received cards from
them -stating they are having a fine
trip to the states. The last cards
received states that they were in Los
Angeles, but were intending to leave
in a few days for Mississipi for a visit
with relatives.
