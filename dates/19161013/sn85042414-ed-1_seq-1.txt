Boston, Oct. 18.—A mbmsHne of
unidentified nationality la reported
about 300 miles east of New York, by
dig steamer Bovio In a vtreleas mes
sage.
The Bovlc is dno in New York to
day, or tomorrow from Manchester,
Rnglimd. Whether the submarine is
pursuing the Bovlc or keeping an In
dependent coarse is not stated. The
Bovlc is a British freighter.
Confirmation of the report that the
Bovlc sighted a submarine is con
tained in a statement by a naval offi
cial at Newport. A passenger steamer
reported to Nantucket shoals lightship
that she sighted a germaa submarine
well astern this morning.
A fleet of foreign cruisers and de
stroyers is off the American coast,
according to captain linderoos of the
Russian steamer Hesperas, which ar
rived here today from Huela, Spain.
To the pilot who boarded his niirt,
Captain Linderoos reported that a
"lot of cruisers and destroyers" passed
his vessel off Cape SaMe Wednesday,

Washington, Oct. IS.—Admiral
Mayo, commanding the Atlantic fleet
notified the navy department today
that he had ordered a survey of the
New England coast to investigate re
ports that belligerent ships had estab
lished a base there, or that wlrless
plants are being operated In violation
of American neutrality. In announc
ing Admiral Mayo's action Secretary
Daniels said several destroyers al
ready had been dispatched from New
port north and that the work was to
be done under the admiral's direction
without instructions from Washing
ton.
U. S. Navy Is Active.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 13.—A far
flung patrol by torpedo boat destroy
ers, charged with the double duty of
enforcing neutrality observance and
saving lives in the event of further
submarine raids on shipping off these
shores, was put into effect from Bar
Harbor to New York today. Official
authority for the statement that such
a patrol has been ordered by the
navy department was obtained here
today. The operations of the patrol
are being directed from the flagship
Birmingham, the headquarters of
Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves.
The Birmingham, at this port, also
Is In readiness to move at any mo
ment. Except in war game manoeu
vers, the coast has not been covered
by naval forces in such a manner for
years.
New York, Oct. 13.—With all lights
extinguished, the steamship Adriatic
of the White Star line, carrying 353
passengers and 1,800 tons of war
munitions, was believed last night to
be speeding south from this port, well
within the three mile zone of safety.
Her announced destination was liver
pool but apparently she followed In
the wake of the freight-laden Pan
nonia and Minnehaha, instead of go
ing due east. The Danish vessel Hel
lig Olav, more venturesome than the
British steamers, took the easterly
course after clearing the Sandy Hook
bar. They were the first vessels to
leave New York for European ports
since the submarine raid Sunday.
The Adriatic left her dock yester
day Afternoon, but. after reaching
Sandy Hook, dropped anchor outside
of the bar until nightfall-
No British or French cruisers which
might act as convoys were sighted,
although It was believed they might
pick up the liner after she was forced
to leave the three mile limit.
There were four Americans among
the 38 passengers in the Adriatic first
cabin. Two other American citizens,
Filipinos, also were on board. There
were no cheery farewells at the pier
as the steamer cast off and most of
those aboard wore serious looks. All
life boats of the upper tier were un
covered and ready for instant use.
ThW Hellig Olav carried about 100
passengers In her first and second
cabin and S5Q In the third oabln.
The British freighter Pannonla
which followed the Adriatic, did not
anchor but headed south, hugging the
Jersey shores. The Pannonla Is bound
for London and her usual course
would be east.

Rumors that Plot Had Been
Unearthed to Make
Trouble for Allies.
London, Oct. 13-—According to the
Times' Athens correspondent, a con
spiracy existed in Greece to officer the
Greek fleet with anti-entente sympa
thizers and concentrating in Tessaly,
in the rear of the allies armies, troops,
guns, stores and material from Athens
and elsewhere. The correspondent
adds that the precautions taken by
the allies, through their ultimatum,.to
counteract these schemes, caused no
surprise in Athens.
The Greek government began at
once to turn over the allies the
lighter craft of the navy to- be dis
patched to the provisional government
at Saloniki. The heavier vessels will
be disarmed and left where they are,
in the gulf of Keratslni.
Sailors Couldn't Understand.
The Greek crews have already been
removed from some of the. warships
and are being landed from the oth
ers. French crews were placed on the
small ships and all guns on the larger
vessels rendered ineffective and placed
under guard.
Quiet is reported at Athens and
Piraeus, but today was a sad day for
Greek tars, who are insufficiently ac
quainted with politics to understand
why they must abandon their ships
to a foreign power, says Reuter's Ath
ens correspondent.
It equally was a depressing sight
for Greek naval officers to watch for
three hours this afternoon,. their ships
being towed away by the allies tugs
"The Allies took every precaution
In case resistance was offered. Rus
sian battleships trained their guns on
the cruiser Averoff, and the battle
ships Kllkls and Lemnos, while
French torpedo bats, ready for action,
cruised to and fro. The king sent a
message releasing every man who
wished to remain with his ship, and

Formerly American Craft.
Recently there have been reports
that Greek warships had deserted the
navy and joined the revolutionary
forces. Among these were the bat
tleship Hydra and two torpedo boats,
which It was declared, left their an
chorages and joined the allied fleet in
Salamls bay. The Kilkls also was re
ported to have deserted, but this was
denied.
The best ships in the Greek navy
are the Kilkis and Lemnos, which re
spectively. are the former American
battleships Idaho and MisslssippI
These vessels were sold to Greece in
1914, Greece paying 312,536,274 for
them. The Helli also is an Amerl
can-built ship having been construct
ed by the New York Shipbuilding
company as the Fel Hung for China
and purchased by Greece in 1914.
Some of the smaller craft were cap
tured from Turkey In 1897.
At the outbreak of the war Greece
had two dreadnaughts under con
struction, one in France and the oth

"Yet the Rumanians pray, despite

Berlin, Oct. 13.—(By Wireless to

Major Ernst Basserman, leader of the

"Our enemies tell us they have im

these achievements of our navy, in
the success of our sailors, we recog

Snbdne British Spirit.
Major Basserman expressed his
confidence that the firm will of the
German nation would bring the war
to a victorious end and "subdue the
hostile spirit of the British govern
ment and the British people."
The budget coihmittee in making its
report said that the committee dur
ing its deliberations was filled with
admiration and gratitude for the Ger
man army and navy and recognised
the successes obtained under their
splendid leadership.
"The committee looks forward with
complete confidence," its report said,
"to the future military development

condemned tbe measures taken by the

No Peace Via White House.
On the other hand, tbe ambassa*

toward Germany and England. These
reports. It is stated by prominent mec
in- a position, to know.:tell .of the lll
feellng in Germany toward America,
of the rapidly growing sentiment for
a resumption, of submarine warfare
without warning and of tbe universal
cry for "no peace via the White

It now is generally believed that
Ambassador Gerard came to America
to confer with President Wilson on a
subject vastly more important to
America than peace, important as
that is. He comes to describe the
heavy black cloud hanging over Ger
man-American relations in the form
of the submarine menace.
What r- S. Must Do.
These reports include wide-spread
comment, chiefly among Americans in'
Berlin, as to what the United States
must do to prevent a repudiation of
German promises. If theee "de
mands" are met, the United States
would have a navy that would off-set'
England's vast sea power. Moreover,
the United States would put an Im
mediate stop to the seizure of neutral
mall, either by forcing England to
stop the practice or by carrying mall
on an auxiliary cruiser of the United
States navy.
William C. Bullitt, a prominent
Eastern journalist, who returned on
the Frederick VIII with Ambassador
Gerard, is authority for tbe follow*
ing:
"In American circles in Berlin it is
believed that the president should
take three steps to avoid the resump

it is my belief that Ambassador Ger

"First, the United States should
