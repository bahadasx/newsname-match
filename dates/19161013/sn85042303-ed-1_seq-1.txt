lifc'UITIE
By TEN submarines of the
U 53 CLASS, SAYS SIMON LAKE,
PIONEER DESIGNER AND BUILD
ER OF UNDERWATER CRAFT.
Bridgeport, Conn., Oct. 1. De
the coast and from submarine mer
chantmen, like the Deutschland.
That is the opinion of Simon Lake,
pioneer designer and ouildcr of sub-
marines.
"It would be no surprise to me"
says Lake, "if the German U-boats
established a blockade of enemy shl;
ping at the entrance to Delaware bay,
Chesapeake bay, Sandy Hook and Bos-
ton harbor.
"Two submarines with submarine
supply bases would be ample to block
ado New York. They could carry
enough foodstuffs to last bIx months
and fuel for three months."
It has been stated that perhaps the
U-53 and other submarines are being
supplied even now from undersea do
pots along the Atlan-ic coast. Lake
says this could be done.
Transfer from the baso, or from
another submarine, to a U-boat under
water Is easy, he says.
"Each ship has a trapdoor which
can be opened, when the air pressure
inside Is equalized with the water
pressure outside, and no water can
enter the ship Just as Is the case
with a 'diving bell,' " says Lake.
"By the use of a system of double
doors in each ship a man In a diver's
suit can go from one ship to the oth
er, along the sea bottom, carrying
provisions or store- of any kind in
water-tight cases."
The same can be done as between
a submarine base and a submarine,
Lake says It was possible that mer
chant submarines, like the Deutsch
land, crossing the Atlantic, supplied
the U-boats under sea and returned
to Germany.
New German War Loan.
Berlin, Oct. 12. A bill for a new
war credit of 12,000,000,000 marks will
shortly be submitted to the Reichstag.
The bill has only a precautionary
character, but Is deemed necessary
because the margin between the credit
granted to June, 1916, totalling 62.
000,000 marks raised through the Ave
war loans has become rather Small.
The new war loan Is not expected to
be floated before spring next year.
as the government hopes to get along
until then with the funds on hand and
the help of short term treasury notes.
On account of the absence of May
or Lasher and Commissioner London,
no session of the city commissioners
has been held for the past week.

Abandon Their Contention of Right

Meets Wishes of America.
Washington. Oct. 13. Radical
changes in the treatment of the mails
of neutral ships are promised In the
reply of the French and British gov

against Interference with mails.
The changes, while short of an
abandonment of the contention of the
right to search for information of
value to the enemy, are regarded by
the allies as sufficient to the wishes
of the United States.
The reply was received In Washing

tion of the democratic party that tho
registration law enabled every quali
fied voter of the state a cast his bal
lot If he chooses and has followed the
law, and protects the sanctity of the
ballot from colonization and crooked
politicians.
Judge Ralney, chairman of the dem
ocratic campaign committee, is well
satisfied over the opinion, believing
that the law as construed protects
every honest voter In the state.
In his opinion, the attorney gen
eral holds that any man who voted
in 1914 is automatically registered
and should be given a certificate by
the registrar, and if he has moved to
another precinct from that in which
he voted in 1914, he may secure a
transfer. The attorney general holds
that all those who aid not vote In
1914 and who failed to register this
summer, cannot now register or vote,
except such as have become qualified
electors since July 1, 1916.

Since soon after the civil
war cotton has not sold so high
as It sold for today. On tho
streets of Ardmore a portion of
the cotton offered brought as
high as 17c a pound.
Cotton men have been assert
ing that the high price was
duo to speculation and that
the high price would not hold
for a very long period. But
what is actually happening
seems to Indicate that there is
a shortage and the price will
hold 'tp during the entire sea
son. However, that Is not
known. The most astute spec
ulator cannot tell what the
cotton market will do. Many
persons advise the cotton farm
er when to sell and when not
to sell, but the best of them
miss it about as o.ten as they
hit it.
The cotton farmer has things
coming his way this fall. The
price of seed was never so high,
cotton has not been so high In
forty years, and there is cause
for general rejoicing.
Usually campaign years de.
press trade and depress prices,
but the wave of prosperity has
such a momentum this year
that the national election does
not Interfere. Thl.i might b
Aiken to indicate that both
Wflson and Hugnes are re
garded as safe men to eloct,
and big business does not have
any fears of what the outcome
w ill be on the 7th of November.
