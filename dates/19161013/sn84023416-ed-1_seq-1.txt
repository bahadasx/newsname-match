VERMONT SAVINGS BANKS.
Annual Report of Rank Commis
sioners F. C. Williams Shows
an Increase in Amount of De
posits, Surplus and Number of
Depositors.
Bank commissioner F. C. Williams
has issued his annual report of the
condition of Vermont Savings Banks
and Savings Banks and Trust Com
panies at the close of business June
30, 1916. This report is of interest
to Vermonters, showing as it does,
that Vermont savings banks and
bankers stand at the head of all the
states in the amount of deposits per
capita of population. The following
is from the report:
DEPOSITS
The total deposits of all the banks
at the doss of business June 30,
1916 were $102,360,304.15, being an
increase over last year of $6,890,578.
92. This increase is divided as fol
lows: The twenty mutual savings
banks have increased $2,468,904.32 in
deposits, and the thirty-eight savings
banks and trust companies have in
creased $4,421,674.60 in deposits for
the year. Two-thirds of this increase
of deposits has taken place during
the last six months of the period.
The savings deposits in all the banks
have increased during the year $5,
907,501.20, and the commercial de
posits have increased during the
same time $983,077.74. The number
of depositors in all the banks has in
creased 9,450, and the number of
Vermont depositors has increased
8,656, while the number of non-resident
depositors has increased 794.
The amount of deposits'by residents
of Vermont has increased $5,910,
905.51, and the deposits by non-resident
depositors has increased $976,
697.02. The number of depositors
having more than two thousand dol
lars each of deposits has increased
1,121, and the amouut of such de
posits has increased $4,995,993.06.
The banks have paid depositors ia
interest during the year $3,567,053.
91. being an increase of $155,424.98
over the previous year. Dividends
paid to stockholders in trust compa
nies have increased $34,572.79, while
the rate of surplus to deposits has
increased .0031. Eighteen of the
mutual savings banks paid deposit
ors at the rate of 4 per cent and two
paid at the rate of 4 1-8 per cent
per annum. Thirty-four of the
trust companies paid at the rate of
4 per cent, and two at the rate of
4 1-8 per annum. Two trust com
panies have no deposits.
SURPLUS
The surplus of all the banks has
increased during the year $875,573.
91, the ration of surplus to deposits
now being .0844 which is a good
showing considering the rapid in
crease of deposits during the past
year.
TAXES
Th3 amount of taxes paid the
State of Vermont upon deposits by
the state banks during the past year
is $690,753.72, being an increase of
$28,051.71 over the previous year.
As a very large proportion of the
savings deposits in the ttate banks
belong to people of small means and
the average deposit is only $449.29,
it is apparent that a large proportion
of the tax upon deposits is derived
from small savings which otherwise
would pay no tax whatever.
INVESTMENTS

banks are of a high character. This
is due to the restrictions enforced by
the banking laws and to the excel
lent and conservative character of
the men who are managing the
banks in this State. The aggregate
strength of the banks in Vermont is
not excelled by the aggregate
strength of the banks of any state in
the country. Considering the rapid
increase in savings deposits in the
banks of the State, and the possible
effect which the Rural Credits Law
may have upon rates of farm mort
gages in the west and south, it may
not be possible for the banks to con
tinue paying depositors at the rate
of four per cent annually unless the
field for investments by the banks is
somewhat enlarged, and it is my
opinion that the Legislature may
well consider the advisability of ex
tending the right to invest in muni
cipal bonds to states which are now
excluded and the right to invest in
the best class of Canadian municipal
bonds. I think it may be well also
to investigate the advisability of al
lowing the banks to invest in first
mortgage bonds of some of the
strongest and best industrial and
public service corporations in this
country, and in the bonds of foreign
countries. There is a difference of
opinion among bankers as to the
wisdom of enlarging the investment
law along these lines, and at the
present writing I am not sufficiently
well informed o that I am willing
to advise definitely with relation to
all these different classes, of invest
ments, but I do advise the Legisla
ture to investigate as suggested.
With relation to proper invest
ments by the banks, I can only re
peat what I have said in former re
ports that banks or the private in
vestor in making investments out
side the State should select with
great care the companies or men
through whom the investments are
made, examirie carefully the terri
tory where the loans are located,
and inspect regularly the property
securing the loan. In making in
vestments at home the same care
should be exercised.
Our state now stands at the head
of all the states in the amount of
deposits in savings banks per capita
of population and over 2C0.000 in
habitants of the State have deposits
in the state banks, and when we
consider that there are forty-nine
national banks in the state, many of
which have savings departments, I
am impressed with the remarkable
position which Vermont occupies in
the number and amount of its sav
ings deposits, but it is entirely pos
sible to very largely increase not
only the proportion of depositors in
the savings banks in the State, but
also the amount.
Public Asked to Act at Once to
Save AVbite Pines.
State( nursery inspectors, state
foresters and other official repre
sentatives from New Hampshire,
Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island and Massachusetts,
met at Fall River Mass., on Septem
ber 25th, at the invitation of the
Massachusetts State Board of Agri
culture, to examine a serious out
break of the white pine blister rust
on native white pine. This examina
tion proved plainly to all that the
blister rust is a deadly enemy of the
white pine.
Reports given by the representa
tives of the states showed that the
white pine blister rust is already
widely prevalent throughout the
New England states and eastern
New York, and as this dangerous
disease uses the currant and goose
berry as a host plant to grow upon
and spreads very rapidly from cur
rant to currant and from the currant
to the pine, it was the unanimous
opinion of all present that as the
only way to avert the impending
catastrophe, and save the white
pine, would be through a complete
destruction of all currant and goose
berry bushes and flowering currants,
the public should be given this in
formation at once.
This disease was brought into the
United States from Europe on white
DIED VERY SUDDENLY
Mrs. Dustin Roardway Stricken
With Death While at Work
Tuesday Evening.
Mrs. Dustin Boardway was taken
ill of cerebral hemorrhage Tuesday
evening while at work in the res
taurant of her husband and died
at 9:30 o'clock. Mrs. Boardway
had beeu in her usual health and
active about the home and restau
rant. The funeral was held Thurs
day afternoon from the Methodist
church at two o'clock, the pastor,
Rev. O. E. Barnard, officiating.
There was a profusion of beauti
ful flowers. Music was rendered
by friends. The bearers were F.E.
Boyce, E. E. Blake, A. P. Cobb,
J. S. Sweeney. The services were
in charge of ArE. Bemis, under,
taker. The remains were taken to
Claremont, N. H., Friday and bur
ial will be in the Mountainview
cemetery Saturday afternoon.
Deceased was born in Unity, N.
H., May 17, 1862. She came to
Island Pond about eight years ago
and for several years Mr.Boardway
has been the proprietor of Board
way's restaurant. Besides her
husband she is survived by two
sons, Fred W. of Claremont, N.H.,
Charles D. of this place, one daugh
ter, Clara, one granddaughter and
several brothers and sisters.
Mrs. Boardway was a member
of the O. E. S., W. R. C, W. C.
T. U., the Methodist Episcopal
church, and the Delta Alpha Bible
class. She was held in high es
teem by all who came in contact
with her. Always willing to do
her share of life's work, her faith
ful devoted life will be a loss to all
who knew her and her place can
never be filled in the home circle
and in the hearts of those to whom
she was near and dear. The fam
ily have the sincere sympathy of
the community in their great sor
row. Those from out of town attend
ing the funeral were Mr. and Mrs.
Fred W. Boardway, Mrs. Charles
Mann of Claremont, N. H.; Clyde
Mann, Sherbrooke, Que.; Wilbur
Allen and family, Elmer Allen and
family, Mrs. Maggie Allen, Mrs.
Josie Boyce of Charleston.
pine seedlings. In the spring the
spores or seeds are blown by the
wind from diseased pines to the cur
rant and gooseberry leaves. The
seeds germinate, penetrate the leaf
tissues and produce a rust on the
underside of the leaves in the late
summer and fall. The leaves pro
duce millions of tiny spores or seeds
capable of infecting the pines, which
once thoroughly infected cannot
recover.
The currant and gooseberry leaves
in large areas throughout the New
England states and eastern New
York are now infected with the
blister rust in the stage when it re
turns to the white pine, and the im
mediate removal of currant and
gooseberry bushes is necessary to
save our white pine trees. It is es
pecially urged that all black and
flowering currant bushes within half
a mile of white pine should be des
troyed at once, since these varieties
are particularly suspectible to the
disease.
Ilolstciiis More Vigorous.
The breed of cows that produces
upwards of one hundred pounds of
milk a day is the breed the practical
dairyman wants on his farm, or at
his his country home.
Holstein cattle have broken every
record in the systematic production
of milk and butter, and there are
many indiviuuals of the breed that
are daily yielding over a hundred
pounds of milk.
Holstein cows are larger and more
vigorous than the cows of any other
breed, they are more easily cared
for, less susceptible to tuberculosis
and other bovine diseases, and when
their milking days are over, they are
far more economical for converting
into beef. There's pleasure and
profit for you in purebred registered
Holsteins.
A breeders' consignment sale at
auction of 125 head of these cattle
will be held Oct. 20 and 21. at Brat
tleboro, Vt., by The Purebred Live
Stock Sales Co.
