that the flames could have been ex

I As a result of the Mexican's story
citizens were aroused at an early hour
and placed on guard around the
Mexican quarter of the town in order
to prevent anybody carrying away
any goods which they might have in
their possession or attempting to
escape. About 40 men were arrested
and their houses searched, and in a
few instances articles believed to have
been stolen on- Thursday morning
were found. This was true In the
case of the section house. When the
Mexican quarter was searched later
in the morning nothing of value was
found in the various shacks, but sever
a! pieces of jewelry which were
thrown from the houses were picked
up on the ground, where, they had
been thrown in an effort to get rid
of any implicating evidence.
Sheriff Cash and County Attorney
Wall were sent for and the matter
will be placed in their hands.
The citizens are worked up to a
high pitch of indignation regarding
the matter and it would have taken
but little to cause the rough hand

The Azbill brothers who were con-

hang on last Friday at the state peni
tentiary at Florence, were not hanged.
An appeal was taken in tneir case
which necessitated a delay until the

this evidence is written up, which has
taken pretty much all the time of the
