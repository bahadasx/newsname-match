TWENTY SECOND YEAR
A CHALLENGE TO
MMAMPBELL
Republican Candidate Has
Opportunity to Answer
Questions
THE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW
How He Would Do
Wondrous Things

the
hi
Tom Campbell will be here to
morrow night to attend a repub
lican meeting at the Armory
where he will deliver his usual
speech in vague terms of what
he will do if elected governor
Now it would seem perfectly
proper if the republican candi
date for governor would become
definite in his plans and tell the
people just what he will do and
what changes he will make if he
is elected governor
For instance he might answer
the following questions
1 How would you cut down
expenses and lower taxes
2 Would you reduce the ex
penditure for education
3 Would you reduce the ex
penditure for good roads
4 Would you stop improving
our public institutions
5 Would you cut off some of
our commissions
6 If so which ones and why
7 How much money would
that save the State
8 How would you favor cap
ital
9 What would you have done
in the Clifton strike
10 You say you will not ar
ray class against class can you
give any instance where Gover
nor Hunt has arrayed class
against class
Jlulf notwJiytdo you stalk
about it
If Mr Campbell has any clear
ideas on these subjects he will
answer these questions They
are reasonable ones We have a
right to demand of anyone who
asks us to put him in the respon
sible position of governor of Ari
zona what he will do in specific
matters If he says he will low
er taxes we have a right to
know how he means to do it
Its all well enough to talk about
increasing efficiency and lessen
ing expenses but it cant be
done by talk
If Mr Campbell has the vaguest
idea of how in the world he can
do it let him say so let him an
swer these questions We dont
believe he will because we dont
believe he can

SAFFORD GRAHAM COTJTSTTY ARIZONA OCTOBER 131916
THE COUNTY FAIR
Was a Grand Success and
Received Support of
the People
M
The credit for the success of
the Graham County Fair is due
to the people for their good work
and support The splendid ex
hibits the large attendance and
the financial success would not
have been possible without the
general support of the people
and the good hard work of those
in charge of the fair As a re
sult several hundred dollars will
be returned to the county treas
ury As soon as it is finished a
complete report will be published
including the receipts expendi
tures and total profit and a list
of the premiums won
Perhaps the most important
thing accomplished by the Fair
Commission is the purchase by
the Board of Supervisors for the
county of the fair grounds This
assures a permanent annual fair
which will now be carried on a
substantial basis and will be
greatly improved each year
Securing the visit of the soldiers
and the military band is per
haps the next thing in import
ance While this feature cost
the commission five hundred dol
lars it was not only the big at
traction at the fair but was also
of great educational value to the
valley The sham battle the
splendid marching and drilling of
the soldiers the beautiful and in
spiring music at the fair grounds
and the choice evening concerts
by the band will never be for
gotten by those who saw and
heard them
This amount of money would
have furnished a lot of cheap at
tractions such as fire works
balloons tight rope walkers etc
which might have made the fair
more lively and might have
pleased some people more but
any number of such attractions
would not equal in value the
work of the soldiers and the mili
tary band part of Uncle Sams
real army - -
The members of the Fair Com
mission readily admit that they
have learned much during this
fair and are sure if they have
anything to do with next years
fair that it can be made very
much better Work has already
been started for next year and
will be continued right up to the
time of the fair
Next week special attention
will be made of some of the de
partments and of those who have
given so much of their time and
best efforts in making the
splendid success of this years
fair

PLAYING BOTH ENDS
Republican Managers Dis
heartened by Thomas
CampbellsjTactics
Special To The Graham Guardian
Phoenix Ariz Oct 13 Tom
Campbell republican candidate
for governor is playing for both
the union labor ote and the
anti union labor vote This was
clearly demonstrated by two re
cent incidents in the campaign
tour of the republican nominee
In Bisbee recently Campbell
patronized a notoriously unfair
restaurant that has been waging
a bitter fight on union labor
When Bisbee republicans pro
tested to him for so doing he
excused himself -on the ground
that he was of the opinion that
the trouble between therestaurant
owner and the union had been
settled He further stated that
he would not have patronized
the place had henown of the
true conditions
A week later while speaking
in Maricopa where there is said
to exist somewhat of an anti
union sentiment he told of the
Bisbee experience and boasted
of having patronized the restau
rant in question- He declared
in his speech that he might have
lost the union vote by so doing
but he had saved hi self respect
Republican campaign managers
are disheartened by the tactics
of Campbell They realize that
he is turning uniorimen against
him and realize fdfther that by
his effort to carry wateron both
shoulders he will forfeit the re
spect of non union voters who
cannot fail to see through his at
tempt to play botb ends against
the middle

Good Roads for Graham County
THE MAXWELL CAR
Good Reasons Why This
Car Holds Scores of
Records
Arrangement of gear ratios in
the Maxwell 25 plus a high speed
motor together with a minimum
number of motor connections is
said by the Maxwell Motor Com
pany to account in a large meas
ure for the fact that the car of
that name stands out so promi
nently in the automobile industry
as a holder of records of all de
scriptions These records not
only include speed tests of all
kinds and overall kinds of tracks
and roads but hill climbing tests
low intermediate and high gear
tests and demonstrations of
economical operation under all
conditions
Recently C C Miller Jr one
of the Maxwell Motor Sales Cor
porations district salesmen oper
ating on the Pacific Coast made
a series of demonstrations in San
Francisco illustrating and prov
ing the contents of the Maxwell
builders relative to the features
which have played so important
a part in making Maxwell his
tory
One of the first tests Miller de
monstrated was the quick pick
up features of the Maxwell
Running the car at a speed of
five miles per hour Miller proved
in the presence of unbiased ob
servers that within a period of
ten seconds the Maxwell could
attain a speed of thirty five miles
per hour A stop watch was
used and this test was repeated
five different times using dif
ferent cars in each instance
Following this Miller drove
the car up the newly paved Twin
Peaks boulevard making gear
changes from high to intermedi
ate whey the car had attained a
speed of thirty miles per hour
without a burr or clash of the
gears This feature of the Max
well Miller claims is the secret
of makingspeed up hills because
gear changes may be made with
out slowing themomentum
of the car the gear ratios being
1048 to 1 on low 621 to 1 on in
termediate and 358 to 1 on high
The fact that the Maxwellmotor
turns over at a rate of 2000 rev
olutions per minute provides a
maximum flexibility to the motor
which makes possible the high
efficiency of the various speeds
Another feature in Maxwell
construction which conserves
the power of the engine and at
the same time produces a mini
mum wear on essential connec
tions between the motor and the
rear axleas against four five
and six in many cars

CLUBS Jf VALLEY
Exhibits are Prominent Fea
ture of the Graham
County Fair
MANY PRIZES ARE AWARDED
Winners Will Send Their Ex
hibit to the Arizona
State Fair
One of the most prominent
features of the Graham County
Fair was the exhibits of the boys
and girls in the club department
at the M E church A total of
eight clubs were represented by
the forty one exhibitors
The girls canning exhibit was
worthy of special mention It
consisted of over two hundred
quarts of fruits and vegetables
including such products as beans
peas and corn which the women
generally find very difficult to put
up The display was carefully
arranged in the west end of the
building in which were the edu
cational and home economics ex
hibits
The judges found considerable
difficulty in awarding the premi
ums because of the high quality
and uniformity of practically all
of the products displayed on
which account it was found nec
essary to award several Special
Mention ribbons
Another very interesting fea
ture was the exhibit by a Pig
Club member and his father
Each had fed and otherwise cared
for a pig out of the same litter
thru a period of eight months
The boys pig was about twice
the size as that of his fathers
and was in very much better
condition
