the banner of Christ, is that God
is deprived of the fruit he reason
ably expected ( Matthewxxv 14-30. )
The true church of God is filled
with mourning for her wretched,
apostate children and the world is
hardened in its iniouitv. unbe-
lievers are encouraged, scoffers
rejoice, euemies of God triumph
and Christ is wounded in the house 1
of his professed friends.
Oh, don't think that to he ani
mated by a spasm of religious
fervor once a year is serving God
acceptably. That life that is filled
with the spirit of, and is continu
ally doing something for Christ a
every opportunity three hundred
and sixty-five days in the year, is
the life that cantruly be called a
Uodly life. Such a life is a brigh
and shining light in this old sin
cursed world.

Human nature being compara
tively the same in all ages of the
"world, we find the above portrait
of the religious inconstancy of an

"to many of us today. They had,

Reader, it is not only necessary
to commence a religious course,

the end. It is not enough to get
-warmed up a little during the revi
val season and then drop back into
a state of indifference and drift

One of the greatest curses of the
world today is religious inconstan
cy. For awhile we present h prom

t -gooduess, as the morning cloud
nd early dew, soon passes away.
