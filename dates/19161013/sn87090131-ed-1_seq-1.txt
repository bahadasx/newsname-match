A LL NATIONS of the world
have their eyes fixed on the
colossal struggle which is
shaking civilization to its very
foulndatlons, but by nIlne is it wt:ltchile
ni th Inore breathless eagerness than
by that prvince on the westernl side

ton-with his feillow-sutbjects of Kaiser
Franz Josef the Latin inhabitant of
Transylvania has absolutely lnot symIl
pathy. On the contrary. hie detests
them, one and all, though he reservtes
his deadliest hatred for his hard task
master, the ilHngurian. But with the
IRoumanian on the farther side of the
Transylvanian Alps he has all things
an common, blood. language, descent.
i oumania, the Roman's land; Tranusyl
vanla, that part of the IRomanu's land
which lies beyond the forests. And
lhat part which lies beyond the for
ests looks with unspeakable longing
for the deliverance which the llaps
burg's overthrow will bring, for that
victory which will reunite her to her
kin, writes J. M. Dodington In Coun
try Life.
It is an Interesting land. that which
lies beyond the forests, and there is,
perhaps, no quainter town in Europe
than its ancient capital, Kolozsvar.
Embosomed in trees, its ancient
houses straggle over several hills, Its
two rippling rivers are crossed by pic
turesque covered wooden bridges
which rival those of Lucerne and
Florence. Its narrow, unpaved streets
are lighted by Alectricity, but sanita
tion, in each and all Of its branches,
is totally ignored, and in its main thor
oughfares, beside the lines of the elec
tric tramway, run open sewers. These
discharge themselves into the two riv
ers. I may add that the visitor has a
not altogether agreeable sensation
when he observes the brown-skinned
washerwomen pounding his linen on
the banks of the said streams and sub
sequently rinsing it In their turbid
waters!
In these narrow, unpaved streets
there are muny lofty and spacious
mansions, tenanted by the haute aris
tocratic of the country. Like the pa
lazzl of Florence and of Rome, the
ground floors of these are entirely oc
cupied by shops. On the first floor,
the piano nobile, lives the owner (if
sufficiently well off to afford such
lodgment). The upper floors are let
to tenants of many degrees, whose
station varies in inverse proportion to
their altitude. If the owner of the
mansion is a poor man, he himself
"goes up higher."
Standing solitary on a hill outside
the town is a whitewashed fortress
from which one has a superb view over
hill and dale, over forest and river,
away and away to the far blue line
of the Carpathians. Kolozsvar also
possesses a fine public park, under
whose fragrant lime trees a magnifl
cent Tzlgany band discourses wildest
music.
Market Day In Kolozavar.
But the greatest charm of the little
town (it has a population of but a
hare 20,000 souls) Is its market day.
Then, under the largest and most
gorgeously colored umbrellas In Eu
rope (I should imagine) do groups of
the most picturesquely attired coun
trywomen assemble, surrounded by
piles of the most delightful fruit and
vegetables, downy peaches, crimson
plums, luscious grapes--purple, yellow
and white-rosy apples, blue-black
figs, blood red poml d'oro, gigantic
melons and cucumbers, huge red pep
pers, produce of garden and orchard
of every color and form, and all
framed In garlands of roses of every
imaginable hue. Present everywhere,
roaming and rooting among the stalls,
are flocks of long-necked geese and
herds of the peculiarly hideous swine
of the country whose happiest hunting
groundls are the Transylvanlan for
ests.
Most beautiful forests they are
which clothe the foothills, magnificent
oaks and beeches, with here and there
a clump of silver birches or an avenue
of stately pines. At rare intervals
comes a clearing In which nestles a
little cluster of mad hats backed by a
miniature village churchl The small
fields which surround the tiny hamlets
are carpeted with wild flowers.
Campions and poppies of immense size
and most brilliant coloring, orchids of
many varileties, cornflowers-blue,
purple and amethyst-wild roses of a
vivid pink and with thornless stens,
yellow snapdragons, delicate harebells
-ad fragrant pina-there is no end
W the variety of blossom.
The air is exhilarating as cham
pagne; though the heat in summner
time is very great during the noontide
hours, at sundlown a refreshingly cool
breeze invariably springs up and a Y
heavy dew begins to fall. It is a moist tl
delightful experience to roam then f
throu;li the beautiful forest, listen- it
ing to the tinkle of the hells as the tl
herds of sheep, cattle, pigs, buffaloes I
wander down the magniticent aisles. If
to the flute of the shepherd and the
horn of the guardian of the swine. d
:'qually pleasing it is, during the heat si
of the day, to spend :lon hours of o
dolce far niente on a sp.. ny lied of a
wild thyme by the side of a brawling u
streamlet-I may add that for the in
veterate angler it is an even more en- a
jlyable experience to extract from its n
dark pools and alluring stickles many d
a lusty trout. For almost all of these 1F
forest "burns" abound in fish-not el
very large, it is true, but vigorous tI
lighters, giving excellent sport.
-Big Landowners the Rule.
There are very few tenant farmers
in the country; immensely big land
owners are the rule, and these, with
the aid of a host of bailiffs, manage
their own estates. They devote each
farm to some special object; one, for
instance, is the ox farts, another the
sheep farm, a third is set aside for
hdrses, a fourth for donkeys, another
for poultry, another for pigs, and yet
another is the dairy farm.
It is. by the way, rather a curious
fact that cows' milk is desplsed by all,
rich man and peasant alike. It is
looked upon as only fit for pigs and
calves, or to be mixed with other milk
in the making of cheese. Only buffalo
milk is considered fit for human con
sumption; this Is, however, to an Eng
lish palate, far too rich, both in qual
ity and flavor.
Outside almost every village in
Transylvania is the gypsy quarter.
Outside it, not in it, for the despised
Tzigany is never allowed to di~ell
among the villagers or to mix- with
them on equal terms. He is the basket
maker, occasionally the brickmaker,
of the neighborhood-but always and E
everyhere he is the music-maker. The
gypsies are the orchestra of every t;
town and village, at every festa they
play untiringly, hour after hour, while C
the peasants dance. Men and women lh
alike are dowered with the gift of mu- t
sic, and the wild Czardas crashed out hi
by a Tzigany band makes even the lh:
cool blood of a Northerner tingle in his ib
veins. of
But fiddling is not the gypsy's only it
accomplishment; he is also a most ex- 1 a
pert thief. In fact, a legend of the a
country says that when a Tzigany l
baby makes its entrance into this vale at
of tears it is laid on its back upon the at
ground, while a purse is placed on its f
right side and a fiddle on its left. Ac
cording to the direction in which it hr
first extends a tiny fist its profession to
in life is determined! cc

THE SONS OF SORROW.
Th, most trifling incident may affect
your own destiny and the destiny of
those who come after you. History is
full of stories illustrating this fact,
aind none of them is more remarkable
than the story of Charles Sanson de
Longval, who sacrificed everything for
love. One day, in the year 1062, he
was thrown from his horse; and as a
direct result of this accident he and
seven of his descendants, for a period
of 200 years, were shunned of men,
as though they were lepers, bearing
upon them the word "unclean."
Charles was the descendant of a
once illustrious house. His forbears
were knights and soldiers under the
dukes of Normandy, and had distin
guished themselves for valor upon div
era fields. They took part in William
the Conqueror's little basket picnic in

His Face Was Haggard and Lined and His Eye. Full of Trouble.
_
England and might have remained
there in opulence, but returned to
their own country.
When the fateful accident happened
Charles was a lieutenant in the army,
his regiment being stationed at Dieppe.
Hle was about thirty years of age, and
handsome and prosperous. His.life
had been full of adventure, for he had
spent several years in the wilderness
of America. He was of a buoyant spir
it and extremely witty, and therefore
a great favorite with'his regiment, and
a pet of his commanding officer, the
Marquis de Laboisslere. He also
as emed the pet of fortune, and It was
agreed by his comrades that he had a
future.
Then one day he went for a horse
back ride, and, just as he left the
town, was thrown to the ground, be
cause of a broken saddle girth. He
was unconscious for a time, and when
he recovered his senses he was being
carried Into a little dark cottage by
a man of giant strength. He was
placed upon a rude couch, and re
ranined there several days before he
was able to leave. He was waited
upon by the man who had carried him
In, and his daughter.
The man seemed bent beneath some
crushing sorrow. His face was hag
g trd and lined and his eyes full of
t touble. He was silent most of the
time, but now and then he talked to
himself in a wild way, and for hours
together he would pace the floor of his
little home, and moan and sob like a
iran in agony. The daughter was
beautiful, but as said as her father.
She never smiled and only spoke when
answering questions. She was so bean
tiful and so gentle, and apparently so
afflicted that the young soldier began
by pitying her. end ended by loving
her passionately. All this time he
didn't know who his host was, and
when he asked the girl, she only re
plied, "Tou will know soon enough."
At last he was able to depart from
the house, and the somber host escort
Ed him to the gate, and said: "We
have done for you what we could.
Never come to this cottage again, it
you have any friendly feeling for me.
I have seen you gaze admiringly at
my daughter. Forget that she lives. I
would see her in her coffn rather than
see her in love."
Charles returned to his regiment
and tried to devote all his mind to
his duties, but he could not forget the
sad girl ln the cottage. So be went
back there, and had a few words with
her; this was followed by other visits,
and his love increased every day. Peo
pile must have seen him going and
coming, and they told his relatives.
A cousin of high estate hunted him
up, and said:
"You surely know who the girl is
you are visitingr"
"I don't even know'her name," said
Chares, "Put I love her with all my
heart."
Come with me," said the cousin.
e'nd Charles accompanied him to a
large public square, where two crim
In is were .bout to be executed.
"Look -t the executioner," said the
cousin.
Charles looked as directed, and of a
sudden :ell so weak )e :"ad to lean on
his Lousin's shoulder. His host of the
little dark cottage was the executioner
of Dieppe. Had ,he cousin been wise,
he'd have said no more, but would
have let the lesson sink in. But he
felt it his duty to preach awhile, and
in the course of his remarks he niade
some slighting, remarks concerning
Marguerite ,Touanne, the executioner's
daughter. Charles' strength came back
as promptly as it had deeerted him.
His sword flashed in the sun.
"Defend yourself!" he cried: "you
are speaking of the lady I love?"
Then there was quite a duel.
Charles was a great swordsman, and
the cousin was in parlous case, when
a friend came to his rescue. Charles
aounded both of them, and sent them
away bleeding and writhing.
The next day when he appeared on
duty all his old friends of the regi.
nwent met him with avert, d faces. His
fellow officers looked all round a.nd
past him, and couldn't see him. No
body responded to his greetings and
people were silent when he asked
questions. He understood it all well
enough. His comrades knew that be
was in love with the executioner's
daughter, and he was a pariah. For
many days he endured this ostracism,
and he began to realize what such a
love as his would cost him.
Then the commanding officer sum
moned him to a conference. The
commanding officer began by telling
him how everybody in the regiment
loved him, and how everybody was at
flicted and humiliated by his present
course.
"Give up this girl, crush down this
insane infatuation," said the marquis,
"and you'll have all your friends again.
As it is, you are disgracing the regi
ment."
Charles drew his sword, and broke
it over his knee.
'Then I belong to the regiment no
longer," answered he. "I'll tear up my
commission at once."
And he did. That night he went out
to the cottage to ask Marguerite to
marry him and go to the new world,
where they lpight begin a new life.
All the visits be had paid were with.
out the knowledge of her father. And
ncw he went to the door on tiptoe, and
knocked gently-a knock she under
stood. There was no answer, and he
stood listening. He heard a moaning
sound, that came from the direction of
an old shed back in the garden. He
stole there quietly. and saw that there
was a light in the shed. The moaning
continued, soon rising to a shriek. He
looked in through a crack, and saw
Marguerite strapped on a leather
ruch. Her father, his eyes glowing
Insanely, was subjecting her to the tor
ture of the boot. He held aloft a ham
mer, was crushing her limb.
"Confess that you love him!" he
was saying.
Then the door flew in as though
struck by a thunderbolt and Charles
was in the room. He knocked the Ald
roan Into a corner and then tore the
engine of torture away from the girl.
The father, half crazed with his men
ial sufferings, had heard that the girl
was planning to elope with an offleer.
For the sake of her lover, the girl
Jenled everything, and he was trying
Lo force the truth from her.
Then Charles outlined his plan, but
the girl would not leave her father,
who was worse than alone In the
world. And the father would not con
tent to her marriage unless Charles
igreed to adopt the old man's grue
ome profession. Charles did not hesl
ate, and under such strange conditions
'se and the girl became engaged, and
were married a few days later.
Alas that such devotion as that of
nharles should have so poor a reward!
IsEa young wife died in less than a
ear, leaving him a son destined for
Ils bloody trade. Charles thus estab
ished the Samson family of execution
'rs, who were the official headsmen of
Prance for two centuries. The last of
he line was dismissed from office in
1L87, when he changed his name and
lisappeared, and no man knows what
meame of hbl.
