ORGANIZATION
Columbus man now heads the
Organization in (his county
Was the unanimous choice
of all the candidates for the
county offices.
At a meeting of the precinct
Jiairmen of Luna county, held
m Denting last Monday, J. H.
Ulair of Columbus was unani
mously elected chairman of the
republican central committee.
I'he candidates and the party
were dissatisfied with Noonan,
who elected himself chairman
.,t the republican county con
vention, and his resignation was
.liiuiivtl. A limuhpr nf the lpnilpra
assembled in A. V. Pollard's of-
iiu last Saturday and received
i he resignation of Noonan. A
man to take his place was not
lei ted at that time, but a meet
ing of the precinct chairmen
was called for Monday, which
was unanimously in favor of the
Columbus man.
It seems that none of the can
't idates favored Noonan as the
hairman but all are well pleased
with the selection of Mr. Blair.
This was a wise choice for
the republicans, and if Mr.
Ulair controls the party as well
as he does his own affairs there
is a probability of great things
being accomplished.
MONEY APPROPRIATED
FOR COLUMBUS JAIL
At the rearular cniarterlv ses
sion of the county commission-
..u V,ol,l in nnmimr lnat week an
appropriation of 5300 was made
to apply on the building of a
!?600 jail in the village of Co
lumbus, the board ol trustees
having agreed to meet the cnun
tv half wnv in the erection of a
place to confine prisoners. The
marshal has had some job on his
hands with no place to lock ' p
prisoners and in many instances
when the police judge had a man
up before him when he really
crht he deserved a iail sen
tence has released him exacting
his promise to get out of the
uinto flhnnlv because there was
no place to use as a jail nenrer
than Dennng. and a trip io me
.ouiity seat with a pr.soner is
rather expensive punishment
from the state's point of view.
The location of the jail has

of utterances from representa

SPEAKS TO A
LARGE AUDIENCE
Celebrated orator delivers one
of the orations that has made
him famous Speaks for two
hours to large and apprecia
tive audience.
One of the largest audiences
ever seen at a political gathering
in Columbus greeted Montaville
Flmvprs. nf Cnlifnrnin. at thr
Airdome Theatre Tuesday even
ing. Mr. flowers held his audi
ence spell-bound for two hours
the only interruptions being the
applause when the names of
Lincoln, McKinley, Roosevelt,
and Charles Evans Hughes were
mentioned, and when a shower
of rain begun to fall, which sent
part of the crowd away and the
remaining ones took position on
the stage.
Mr. Flowers had been sent to
Columbus by the national repub
lican committee and while it was
expected that he would deliver
a republican campaign speech,
it could hardly be called such.
He began with the history of
the two great political parties,
briefly tracing them on down
to the present time, giving each
side credit where credit was due.
explaining the errors as ho snw
them.
He discussed the Wilson ad
ministrating, dwelling at length
on the pledges made in the cam
paign lour years ago, wnicn
have not been kept, tne one
lorm nlnnk contained in the Bal
timore platform was brought to
mind. The statement aiso in tne
platform that tariff other than
fnr rpvpiiiin was not richt and
was unjust he read from the
democratic text ooox or i-jiz.
and then reminded his hearers
nf the recent nrotective tariff
law on sugar. The child labor
law and the joker it contains
was discussed, also, but what
was of the most interest to the
people was his handling of the
Mexican question. Mr. Wilson,
according to the speaker's view
point had neglected to keep
his pledge to tne American peo
ple, in failing to protect life and
property in foreign lands.
Many other important issues
of the campaign were touched.
but space will not ue taken to
recall them. Several democrats
were present and none could
help but admire nis siraigm ior
ward and convincing methods he
employed in the address.
The speaker was introduced
by Countv Chairman, J. R. Blair
in a few remarks, in wnicn ne
..i,i Mmt Mr Flowers was no
politician and was not a candi
date for any oince.
Harry Whitehill drove Mr
Flowers over from Deming.
where he had spoken the even
ing before. After here he went
to Las Cruces and then to two
or three points m the eastern
part of the state and then left
tor Indiana, wnere m-
during the remainder of the
campaign.
His mam idea in coming iu
the border was to get flrfit-hand

question, and he said that he
had learned many sioues mi
he would tell the people dbck
