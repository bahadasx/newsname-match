SUBMARINE FEAR
HAUNTS THE SEA'
COURSE IS MYSTERY
Many Believe That U-54 Has
Made Best of Way Back, to
Heligoland.
New York, Oct. 11.?Although J
there was no indication today that i
the German submarine U-53 still was
luiking off the American coast and(i
while some shipping Interests believ-|<
ed she had headed for Heligoland,!
there was evidence that the British :
admiralty will proceed with caution
In allowing British ships to leave i
Atlantic coast ports. Two British
vessels due to sail today were detain- <
ed and it was reported that others
which- had cleared, both French and
British, will not sail at nresent.
Shipping circles heard today that
Admiral Montague Browning, at
Halifax, commanding the British
fleet off this coast, has issued orders
detaining the British merchant ves-1
sels now in American ports. Verifl-!
cation of this report could not be obf
talned at the British consulate which
issues the final sailing orders, but it
was-admitted that sailing orders fori
the Cunard freighters Pannonia and
St. George, due to sail today, had
been withheld.
A dozen other British ships, in-I'
eluding the White Star passenger
liner Adriatic, cleared today but it
was said that with the exception of
the Adriatic the dates of their departure
would depend upon develop-,
ments in the efforts which it is taken 1
for granted, the British admiralty is
j making to rid American waters of!
the submarine danger.
The Adriatic, White Star line officials
said, would sail at noon tomorrow
aud prospective pussenger havej
been so notified.
The continued absence of advices
Indicating additional submarine ac-:
tivities along the Atlantic lanes re-1
suited today in reduction in marine
insurance rates from the high mark
struck Monday. Rates were quoted
at 2 1-2 per cent, a drop of 50 per
cent from the general quotations
earner in me weea. rnere was a
strong tendency in naval circles today
to believe that the U-53, unless
that craft has received fresh sup
plies on this si<le of the Atlantic, Is
headed for her base at Heligoland.

for miles around. It is also
hoped that in connection with these

Mothing of a material nature would
add more to the town than this. \
