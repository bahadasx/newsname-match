Crowd Throngs Electric Theatre
To Hear C. N. Pray and F. Edwards
Pray Delivers Ringing Address on National Issues, Par
ticularly as to Mexico and the Tariff. Edwards
Covers State Issues
A crowd that packed the
Electric Theatre and overflowed
to the street turned out last
evening to listen to the stirring
addresses by Charles N. Pray,
republican candidate for U. S.
Senator, and Frank J. Edwards,
republican candidate for Gov
ernor. The rally was a bit dif
ferent to the usual political
gathering. The specchmalung
was prec. ded by a shot t, crisp
movie comedy that the big
audience greatly enjoyed. At
frequent intervals a group of
high school boys rent the air
with cheers for Pray, Edwards
and Hughes.
Bruce R. McIN nur presidea
and opened ihc program by
introducing a male quartet ironi
Choteau. Tins quartet sang twu
or three catchy songs, piaying:
upon the weaknesses ol üemoc-i
racy, tnat caused much mirth.
Cnaries N. Pray was men in
troduced and m the
time al
lotted to his part of the speak
ing presented two or three of 1
the salient arguments why the
present administration should
not be retained in power for an
other four years. The Mexican
chapter of dark misdeeds and
the lailure of the Underwood
tariff law before the European
war were handled with telling
force and the speaker was fre
quently interrupted with vigor
ous applause.
Frank J. Edwards followed
Pray. Edwards is a strong
personality. It must be ad
mitted that many repub-icans
in the audience were not in ac
cord with a great portion of his
speech, in which he lambasted
the present state administration
with withering invective. His
exposal of the Northwestern
Trustee scandal, by which two
state offiers ara now under in
dictment, was true to record but
when he veered into a scathing
denounciation of the railways
that traverse Montana he lost
the sympathy of a large number
of fair-minded people, who be
lieve there is too much of this
rant and arraying of class hat
red in this campaign. It is on
a par with that wheezy cry of
of democracy—"Wall Street is
backing Hughes." As between
the fearless, honest, radical
Edwardsand the sleek, smug|
pet of privelege in Montana, I
Governor Stewart, take your!
choice.
A dance and get-acquainted
meeting with county candidates
followed the speech-making, in
the Electric Hall. The first big
republican rally was a success
ful and enjoyable event.

Stewart-Mitchell
Get Good House
The democrats had their inn
ing Wednesday evening and
"went to bat" with a big
audience. Earl M. Davis very
efficiently presided and made
gracious littie talks in intro
ducing the speakers.
Harry Mitchell was the first uj
Harry is not so happy in th(
role of public speaker. The job
is laborious to him, nevertheles
he manifested more sincerity
than the headiiner, Gov. Ste
wart. Harry deplored the
"military spirit" in America
but forgot to say that the pres
ent democratic congress made
the biggest appropriation in
history for military prepared
ness and that at Kansas City
President Wilson declared for
''incomparably the biggest navy
i n world.
ov " . t> ,f e y vait * s * ee ^- well
pt anU P'® as n i puichritude,
is very much at ease on the
rostrum and is a speaker of no
mean ability. The Governor
can paint the sunset, gild the
go'-d and flop the wings of the
eagle to your heart's desire. It
was to the women he matfe Ms
strongest appeal and when he
shot across that now very
trite slogan "thank Gawd for
Wilson" his voice was so full of
emotion that it would seem
that the hardest heart should he
touched. In playing to the
women the good Governor in
voked what in rude parlance is
known as the Big Sob, or mo;e
rudely, the Sob Sisters. W.th
his little wand he conjured
these overworked sisters and
paraded them up and down the
stage. One had mental images
of bleaching bones on blistered
deserts, wives and sweethearts
waiting in humble cottages
for the return of the loved ones
in distant lauds—and then, the
familiar slogan was shot over
again "thank Gawd for Wilson."
But the women in the as
sembly did not seem to fall
hard for this weepy line ot
language. No subdued sobs
were heard and few handker
chiefs were brought into com
mission. The women are com
mencing to realize that this
weepy-willow "Thank Gawd"
appeal is being overplayed.
Gov. Stewart and Harry
Mitchell were given an oppor
tunity to meet voters of all
Parties after the speechmaking
and all enjoyed meeting the
head of the state government
and the man who aspires to go
to Congress. From here the
party went to Kalispell.

On Keeping Us Out o f PVar
The claim that President Wilson has kept us of war
with the belligerents of Europe is most farfetched and
ludicrous, and would do credit to Munchausen. We all
know that the warring nations of Europe have had their
hands full on land and sea in battling against each other.
None of them had any ships or soldiers to spare an attack
upon, or invasion of our country, and none of them has
manifested a purpose or desire to make such an attack or
invasion,— Senator Knute Nelson at Sunbtir
Getting Stale
During the past year this sec
tion of Montana has been del
uged with cheap so-called west
ern performances, known as
Stampedes, Carnivals, Roundup
and the like, managed in the
main by frowsy-dowdy pro
fessionals who travel from
place to place, coining into
currency the curiosity of the
newer element in our popula
tion for something "wild west
ern." This from the Portland
Live Siock Reporter, pertaining
to county fairs is to the point:
Cheap hurdy-gurdy shows
and games of chance, which we
find at the usual county fair,
serve no purpose whatever and
should be eliminated. In the
average agricultural hall you
will find fine exhibits of farm
products, and the work of the
children of the county; the barns
contain a goodly showing of
well-bred live stock worthy of
the closest study. Given a crowd
of 5000 people, 4500 of them will
be congregated around a "duck
pond" trying to throw three
balls into a tin bucket, in the
hopes of securing a poor duck
for which they have no use.
Other people will be throwing
at nigger babies or trying to
ring a cheap 10-cent knife. The
people really do not care to do
these things, but are swayed
by the "bally hoo" of the fakers
in charge. These fake concess
ions have no more right at a
county fair than the cheap
"wild west" feature and sooner
or later will put out of business
any agricultural association
that tolerates them.
Paper Panic

Fatal Ending of Hunting Trip Is
Deplored By Entire Community
While Hunting Ducks in Ethridge Lake Andrew Hoff
man Loses Life by Accidental Discharge
of a Shot Gun
The discharge of a shot gun
in a boat being rowed by An
drew Hoffman in the small lake
near Ethridge, last Sunday
morning, caused the death of
that young man the same night
about midnight, after a day of
great suffering, from shock and
exhaustion of blood.
The victim of this deplorable
accident was approaching a
small flock of ducks and a
movement either of the oar or
nis body caused the discharge.
The charge entered his right leg
about the knee, shattering the
bone and flesh in a horrible
manner. He instantly called for
Help and several from town
neard the cry and rushed to his
aid. He attempted to row to
shore, but was overcome by
iaintnesu an exhaustion. Two
or three persons waded in and
brought the boat to the shore
and the injured man was taken
to the Ethridge hotel. Drs.
Neraal and Nelson were called
over phone from Cut Bank and
went at once to the scene, in
company with the stricken
father. They remained by his
side constantly, administering
sedatives and striving to allay
suffering, but to no avail. The
young man, tlie attendants say
was brave and cheerful to the
the end, resigning himself
neroicaliy to his late.
The news of the accident and
death caused sorrow in the
community, deep and wide
spread. Andy, as his friends
affectionately called him, was
a clean-cut young fellow of
strong character and sturdy
moral fibre. He was associated
with his father, Christ Hoffman
in the carpentar contracting
trade and was a very competent
workman and valuable aid and
counsellor to his father. He
was well equipped education
ally, having graduated from
St. Thomas College, St. Paul,
seven years ago. He was
twenty five years of age at the
time of his death.
Funeral services were con
ducted from St. Margaret's
Church on Wednesday morn
ing at 10 o'clock, by Rev. Father
Greven, who spoke with feeling
upon the life of the deceased
and his many traits of char
acter that were worthy of
emulation. The memory of
such a life to the sorrowing
parents and other members of
the family should help to light
en their sorrow, he declared.
Following the ceremony the
remains were conveyed to
Crown Hill cemetery and laid

A Prediction As
to Wheat Prices
The young man does not
live today," says the Western
Grain Journal. "Who will ev
er see wheat sell below a dollar
a bushel. A great many ex
perts doubt if it will ever get
below $1.25 per bushel for many
years to come. Not only will
the price of wheat remain ex
cessively high for a great many
years, but all products of the
farm will be correspondingly
high, as is always the case.
"High food price for many
years to come are now as
certain as the sun rises and sets
as sure as day follows night. It
cannot be otherwise. With mil
lions of the producers in Eu
rope being killed, leaving
women, children and old men
dependent upon themselves,
Europe will not be self-sustain
ing for generations. With mil
lions upon millions of acres of
the finest agricultural lands in
Europe, rendered worthless
through present day war meth
ods, the task of crop cultivation
becomes a dilficult one.
"There are not sufficient ag
ricultural lands lying idle in all
the universe to make up for the
ruined area of Europe. Even
though the last acre of unoccu
pied land in this country were
intensely tilled, the production
would be incullicient to supply
the demand. As a consequence
prices of all food products wi 11
run exceptionally high for
years to come."
