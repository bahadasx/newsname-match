"It would be difficult to forecast the
wonderful development that will fol

work, of classification of the varloua
tract of O. A C. landa here In south

"J know of no other dlatrlct that

tural development In aouthero Oregon
la farther behind than In any equal
'are of the northwestern atatea. due
to the fact that ao mnch of the area

Work Haa Hem Rapid
It waa raid-summer before Mr.
Sharp and hi party were put In the
Held to olaaaify the landa of the
O. 4 C. railroad grant forfeited to the
federal government. But ao well ha
Mr. Sharp organised hla campaign
that he ha already completed the
clarification of Klamath, Jackson and
Josephine counties, comprising the
southern Oregon district, and the
landa of the unit will be ready for
opening aa aoon a the necessary de
tail can be arranged. The opening
of theee landa will follow the home
tend law, and according to Mr. Sharp
thoae already classified should be
ready for the land-hungry public
within a very short time. The Klam
ath lands, he says, should be ready
at tbia time, and the opening of all
ot thla dlatrlct should be well under
way by the first of the year.
The plan that will no doubt be fol
lowed In the distribution of the lands,
aaya Mr. 8harp, la regulated by the
department. Flrat, formal notice that
certain landa are to be opened for set
tlement upon a definite date I given
the public through advertisement by
the department. Filing are received
at a fixed date, the entryman to file

He must have been upon the land
which he wishes to homestead, and
must specify the exact piece for which
he applies. Should there be more
than one applicant for a certain piece,

get the tract. Upon the acceptance
of the entry, the successful one will
pay 60 cent' per acre toward the

ClanHlrlcaUon la Comprehensive
Under Mr. Sharp'a supervision, a
most'' comprehensive classification of
the grant lands la being made. The
party of about 100 I divided into
ramps, each camp consisting of cruis
er and compassmen, cook and camp
tenders, etc, The section line are all
carefully eetabllthed and each 40
acre tract of land I reported upon
In detail, the report showing the topo
graphy, the character of the land a
regards It adaptability to farming or
grating, Its aoll and surface condi
tion, accessibility, and In fact nota
tion Is made of every point that
might occur to an Inquiring settler.
A slndy of the report will show exact
ly how much timber and of what kind
can be found upon each Individual 40
acres. It will tell the kind of Boll,
how much la .flat lands and what the
clevntlon ofsthe hill may be. In
fact, coming front experts, tjjese re

valuable kind of guide for Intending

not be opened under the homestead
law. The timber will later be dis
posed of by sale by the government.
It waa evident from a talk with Mr!
Sharp, however, that the bulk ot the
landa already classified, and especial
ly a large proportion of the lands in
Josephine county, would be claaalfled
a agricultural and would be opened
to entry within the next few weeks.
Mr. 8harp stated that while the re
ports npon the Individual 40-acrestib-
dlvlalon had not yet been aeparated,
by far the greater part of the 188.
000 acres of the grant lands In thla
county would classify as agricultural.
Some of the reports show mnch tlni-
ber. bnt not quite enough to classify
It aa timber landa. Upon some of
the bomesteada there will be one mil
lion feet or better of timber, or Just
under the 1.200,000 feet1 that would
put It In the timber class. The classi
fication baa been by some of the best
timber experts In the west, men who
know what merchantable timber la,
and who, to quote Mr. Sharp, do not
think that because a tree haa limbs
and leaves that U should clasajfy aa
timber. This liberal classification Is
responsible for the large amount that
will be returned aa agricultural land.
' Xo fliaace for the Grafter
In the opening of thla great body
of land. H Is plain that the system
used will not make a place for the
grafter, the fraudulent locator or the
speculator.
"The Intent of this opening of the
grant la to place the landa In the
hands of developers and home build
ers rather than of the speculator," is
the way Mr. Sharp puts It. And one
can feel that Mr. Sharp Is the kind of
a man who wants the publto to get
nil there la In the grant without hav
ing to pay tribute to locator and
grafters. That Is why his men are
Instructed to make a graphic report
npon each tract, for when the report
