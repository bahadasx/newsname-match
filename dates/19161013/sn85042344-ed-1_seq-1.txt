Brooklyn Nationals. 4 to 1, In the fifth

As a rusult of tho four games to one
conquest over the statiilurd-be-crers of
tho National league, Hoston is tonight
celebrating Its fifth victory In world s
Sorles since 190 J. and there Is added

to bow to the superior prowess of a
rival In such combat.
Tho victory over Brooklyn In the
final meeting of the teams was so
clean cut and decisive that there was
left no ground for argument. That

DUI WHO oLIuulCU
.Jimmy Davenport Forgot
to Sto) at Democratic
JJally Last Night.
TALKED ON AND ON
Senator Who Was llcad-lim-r
Was "All About,"
Though in Jlis Apparel.
TIIK secret is out.
Senator J. Hum Iowi.s did not
cuiuo to Tulsa to make votes for Wil
son. Ilia mission hero was to draw a
crowd for Congressman Jim Daven
port, candidato for re-election.
Truth outdid Itself at tho Demo
cratic meeting in Convention hall lust
night when, after the various intro
ducers had m. lib1 their introductions
of tho Introduced, Mr. Davenport toon
the floor uinl In his usual frank and
opin-fuco manner said:
"Now that I've got you here you've
got to listen to mu."
Those were, the words as the sten
ographer caught them, with the lisp
left out.
And later on when countless audit
ors had forsaken the hall after leaving
Instructions with the doorman to call
them at their homes when Davenport
should havo finished his campaign
oration, and restless souls in the audl
eiue began Impatiently to cry out for
"Le.wis! I-wls!" the Honorable. Joeins
raved on und on and on. Like the
sands of time, It began to appear that
bis speech would last through all
eternity.
Ho answered the address of Sena
tor James W . Wadsworth Jr., who
spoko under Republican auspices here
a few nights since, he replied to nearly
all of the articles that have appeared
in Tho World about him. be defended
Wilson and the administration, he re
citod tho ulleged virtues of all the
Democratic legislation since Hector
was a youthful canine and Just when
a vigilance committee of fellow-Democrats
was being organized to take
summary action he abruptly halted
and Introduced In six words tho speak
er of the evening.
Advancing to the footlights the
famed Democratic "whip" of tho sen
ate gave an Imitation of Horatio at
the Bridge wbllo the mighty throng
thundered Its approval of Jim's action
In coming to a halt. The applause was
partly ovation and partly exubera
tion. l'nl(Ue In ApiMiiraucc.
Senator IjowIs .Is uniiiie in appear
ance. In hirsute adornment he ad
mitted that his only competitor was
the Republican nominee for presi
dent. His whiskers are not exactly
pink they are more of muckledy dun,
a tobacco-stained gray. His hair Is
dark, and rather thick, and parted in
the middle. I'rcini the rear ho looks
like Napoleon. Last night he was at
tired in a brown Kngllsh walking suit,
a lavender silk shirt and what goes
with them. He woro one of tho latest
collars ami neckties direct from the
lioulu .Mich.
Hut this Is icVing ahead of the
story. To begn Vlth, the Imposing
pageant that vas to have preceded the
meeting failed to materialize at
least the reporter aligned to the
story didn't see It and three Main
street traffic cops who were Inter
viewed on the subject confirmed his
suspicions.
The audience was a large one sucn
an audience as might be expected on
un occlusion of that, kind and one
that certainly must have delighted the
committee. It was an old-fashioned
rally In every sense of the word. The
committee filed onto tho stage like
pallbearers at. a funeral, only looking
more Important. Woodson K. Nor
vell, champion lightweight of Tulsa
county and chairman of the Demo
cratic county central committee, was
led In by a large cane that never re
leased him during the entire evening.
He was followed by his able lieutenant,
John Keardon, John performed true
to form by going to sleep three times
and applauding at the w rong time fre
iiuent'y. However, he finished strong
and was the first to prasp the
speaker's hand at the finish; in fait,
he held on so long, backing away at
the same time, that many out In front
thought It was a wrestling match.
Tudge Flldos, the campaign manager,
Colonel Olaso, the town crier, and
many others of tho faithful aides were
present and wearing cleun collars In
honor of the event.
fiave Knglo a Twist.
Chairman Norvell. fully conscious
of tho importance of his position, car
ried out tho old-fashioned rally idea
to the letter by giving the eagle a
couple of twists by the tail and sing
ing the "Star-Spangled Manner" in a
muffled tenor voice. Later In the
evening there were more evidences of
old-fashlonedlsm when the fellow you
ran never keep still yelled at the top
of his voice: "Tell 'em about itl
Whoopee!"
Mr. Norvell introduced Pat Malloy
ond while the latter occupied the cen
ter of tho stage the audience appeared
contented and satisfied. Mr. Malloy
displayed his usual splendid Judgment
tiy being brief. He plained showed
that Democracy in tnese parts is re
united tiy Introducing Congressman
Davenport, his late political enemy, as
"the next congressman," etc.
Following are excerpts from tho ad
dress of Congressman Davenport:
"My opponent Is an oil man; I am
for all tho people."
"Fellow Americans."
"Myself and the president."
"My socialist friends und my Re
publican friends."
"I rose from a rill-splitter to my
present position; Just think what you
ran mako out of yourself, my friends."
"I voted for the Adamson law."
And many other saws and sayings
that spuce nor Inclination do not per
mit the publication of here but which
will no doubt appear in a subsequent
Issue of tho Congressional Record.
Editor's note After the above was
written Mr. Reurdon came to the of
llce und said that all he cared to say
was that tho meeting wus on un
qualified success and thut he t bought
Mr. Lewis would be elected.

WASIirXOTON, Oct. 12. Investi
gation of Oermaiiy's submarine
operations off Nantucket apparently
has eased tho minds of officials here,
nut It wus said authoritatively tonight
that hhould the situation develop pro
longed paralysis of American trade in
the Atlantic or any similar Injury to
vital American Interests, a broad Issue
might be raised transcending tho
specific question of Intel national law
discussed In connection with tho V
boat raid
Such considerations as tho disloca
tion of shipping along the Atlantic
seiilioard. the meat Increase In marine
Insurance rates and the possibility of
serious freight congestion und rail
road embargoes have been foremost In
the minds of officials, It was indi
cated, and will determine largely the
government's policy if an extensive
submarine campaign Is ultempted on
this side of tho Atlantic.
View Future Fearfully.
The sinking of the Dutch steamer
Hloomcrsdljk, flying a neutral fh'-g
and plying between two neutral porta,
Is understood to be one of the con
siderations that has led officials to
view with apprehension the future of
submarine operations on tne Amer
ican shores. What measures Germany
mnv contemplate against neutral trade
out of American ports Is a matter oi
llvolv speculation. Regaidiiig the
llloomei'hdiik case specifically, how
ever, the state department In under
stood to feel that this government has
no cause for complaint.
- So fnr he department has made r.o
extensive Investigation of the effect of
th Nantucket raid on American trade
nnd Is expected to consider that Inrl
'! i t solely on its merits as an Indi
vidual case In international law.
Should raids continue, however, the
resultant restraints on American in

BAYO.YNK, N. J., Oct. 12. One man
was killed and at least a scora
wounded, two of them so seriously
they nro not expected to live, In a
pitched battle here late today between
t'triking employes of the Standard Oil
company nnd the police. The fight
was the culmination of a series of dis
turbances that began Wednesday and
continued throughout last night ant
today. New Jersey militiamen back
to be speeding south from this port,
well within the three-mile zona of
Mfety. Her announced destination
was Liverpool and her course to that
city would lead east from Sandy Hook.
She apparently followed in the wake
of the freight-laden Fantionla and
Minnehaha.
The Lmnlsh. vessel Helllg Olav, more
venturesome than tho Hrltlsh steam
ers, took tho easterly course after
clearing the bar. They wero the first
vessels to leave New York for Euro
pean ports since the submarine raid
of Sunday.
The Adriatic left her dock this af
ternoon, but after reaching Sandy
Hook dropped anchor outside the bar.
As night fell no lights flashed aboard
the big liner. It was believed, how
ever, that Hhe headed south soon after
T o'clock.
No Hrltlsh nor French cruisers
which might act. as convoys were
sighted, although It was believed they
might Pick up the liner after she was
forced to leave the three-mile limit
There were four Americans among
the 38 pasoengers in the Adriatic's
first cabin. Two other American citi
zens, Fillplnoc, also were aboard.
There were 108 passengers In the sec
ond cabin and ono hundred in tho
steerage. There wero no cheery fare

a meeting hero tonight in which he
declared that the "new freedom" ad

Mr. Hughes spoke 111 six towns to

Tin y came down from I lie mountains,
men ami women on foot, on horse

and many of the women that camu
to hoar him came wearing their

At sovcral slops the nominee's spe

InfthlH speech horo tonight Mr.
Hughes devoted much of his attention
to the protective tariff and to what
he termed the "new slavery."
"Wo havo hoard much of tho new
freedom," he said. "It seems to have
a surprising and deplorable laiigo. It
has meant freedom to sacrifice tho
principles of the merit system which
our opponents pledged themselves to
enforce. Thousands of offices have
been created with tho provision that
they might be filled without reference
to tho requirements of the civil serv
