Public Service Body Says
Water must be Taken from
Middle of Stream.
TO SUBMIT PLANS TO
COMMISSION AT ONCE
Report of Engineer Urging That
Intake Be Near Bank
Overruled.
A new intake tower or crib to be
sunk in the middle of the river above
the mouth of Sloan's Creek Wednes
day was ordered built by the Missouri
Public Utilities Company in a com
munication sent by the Missouri Pub
lic Service Commission to Attorney I.
R. Kelso.
City Clerk R. W. Frissell yesterday
afternoon received a copy of the order
from the Public Service Commission to
the Utilities Company, setting forth
the basis of the new intake's construc
tion. The question of installing a crib or
tower in the center of the river was
broght up this summer when the water
fell to a level which would permit
work. A change in the plan was pro
jected by the engineers on account of
the coast of the tower in the middle
of the river.
Paul E. Bayliss, an engineer for the
Public Service Commission, came down
to the Cape to make an investigation
of the situation and in his report, rec
ommended that the plans be changed
so that the tower would be replaced
by a pipe line and well dug at the river
bank.
The question was referred to the
City Council for its opinion of the
c hange and at the, last meeting the
Council voted to stand by the tower
which was recommended by the Public
Service Commission two years ago.
The letter ordering the tower built em
bodies City Clerk Frissell's communi
cation to the Public Service Commis
sion and is as follows:
"Dear Mr. Kelso: The following is
a copy of a letter received from Mr.
R. W. Frissell, City Clerk, Cape Gir
ardeau: "'Mr. T M. Bradbury: Your 'etter
of September ?,0, together with copy
of memorandum submitted by Paul E.
P.ayliss, has been received by Mr. Fow
ler, chairman of the Water & Light
Committee, and was by him referred
to the City Council in regular session,
on October 2, 191C.
"'By order of the council, unanim
ously approved, I am directed to in
form you, that no substitute for the
intake tower as recommen d by the
Commission two years agi , will be
considered, and that the : nstruction
of said intake tower will be insisted
upon. Very respectfully, R. W. Fris
selfi City Clerk.'
"The order of the commission of No
that your company shall prepare and
file with the commission, within "0
days after the effective date of this
order, plans and specifications in writ
ing, for construction of a new intake
tower or crib, etc. Your acceptance of
this order is on file with the com
mission. "The commission insists upon the
compliance with its order, and that you
file at an early date with the commis
sion, plans and specifications required.
Your prompt attention and reply is
requested. For the commission, T. M.
Bradbury, secretary."
In an interview given at the time
time the question of changing the in
take plans were under discussion, Mr.
A. M. Tinsley declared that it was dif
ficult to get contractors to undertake
the construction of the proposed tower.
He said also that its -cost would vir
tually make it prohibitive in the Cape.

Republican Candidate Says
Accusation Is Not Worthy
of Notice.
MOUNTAINEERS FROM
KENTUCKY HEAR HIM
Men and Women Bide to Town
on Mule Backs to See First
Presidential Candidate.
Louis, Ky., Oct. 12. The special
train carrying Charles E. Hughes, on
his third Western trip, was stopped by
a broken rail on the point of a curve
around a steep embankment of the Big
Sandy River leaving Paintsville today.
The rail was broken for a distance of
several inches, the inside flange hav
ing been knocked entirely away.
The Republican nominee today car
ried his campaign to the mountains
of Kentucky and into mining and lum
ber towns never before visited by a
presidential nominee. His audiences
were composed largely of men and
women who had traveled miles by
horseback and by muleback to hear
him as he outlined his views on
the maintenance of American rights
abroad.
"I stand as the representative of a
party," he told an audience in the
streets of Prestonburg, "but in the
true sense as a representative of the
American sentiment which demands
that the lives and property of Amer
ican citizens shall be safeguarded
throughout the world. That does not
mean a policy of war. Our opponents
have said recently, in effect, that if we
oppose what they have been doing we
must necessarily favor war. That, to
my mind, is a statement which hardly
deserves notice, it so plainly is con
trary to the facts.
"I do not desire war. Who could de
sire war? We know the awful wastes,
tragedies of war. We are devoted to
the pursuits of peace. We are friendly
with every nation under heaven and
every nation desires to be friendly
with us. We have no policies of an
aggressive character; we do not covet
anybody's territory, and we aren't
seeking anything that is not our own.
"We only ask that our just rights,
our rights, be maintained.
"We canot have peace for any great
length of time unless we have self
respect. We cannot have peace or se
curity unless we have the esteem of all i
the nations of the earth. We must
deserve this esteem if we are going to
enjoy it. When we have known rights,
every nation must understand that we
are firm in their maintenance, that we
mean what we say, that we are pre
pared for every emergency, and that
we stand four-square to the world with
no secret intrigues, with no covert un
derstandings, but determined that
American rights, according to inter
national law will be safeguarded every
where." BABY ILL WITH DIPHTHERIA
Home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Hohler
to be Placed Under Quarinline.
The infant son of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Hohler, who live on South Mid-
die street, is seriously ill with dinh-jhas
theria. The child became sick several
days ago, but its ailment was not of a
serious nature. Fever developed yes
terday morning and a physician was
summoned. He found the child was
suffering from diphtheria.
The Hohler home will be placed un- j
der quarantine this morning, it was
learned last night. There are several !
other case of this malignant disease in I
the city, and the city authorities are
taking precautionary measures to pre
vent the disease spreading.

Mayor Nets City
$800 In Swappin'
With Fire Horses
Recovers $600 on Team Kill
ed by Live Wire Buys
Successors for $210 and
Disposes of Them for $600
to Auto Truck Concern.
Mayor Kage yesterday; finished for
the city one of the most clever "horse
swappin'" deals in all his history as
a good trader, when he received a
check for $200 from A. M. Tinsley, lo
cal manager of the Missouri Public
Utlities Company. t
The $200 check represented -damages
that the Utilities Company paid to the i
t il 1 . il. 1 1. !
city i or ine loss oi me two lire norses
last spring when they were killed by
a live wire in the midst of a run to a
fire through a severe electrical, wind
and rain storm.
When the Mayor checked up ac
counts yesterday afternoon after he
had received the Utilities Company
money, he found that his profit for
the city in his fire horse transactions
amounted to ?S00 net, or almost
enough to pay his salary for three
years.
In the first place, after the two old
horses were killed by the live wire,
the Mayor realized $400 from the in
surance company for their death. The
city had three animals insured for
S600, so that $100 was paid for the
death of two. The death occurred just
about 13 days before the expiration of
the policies also.
The Mayor at the same time, inform- j I)V mpans of con,-emnation proceed
ed Mr. Tinsley that he would expect j the Mavor pai(i thp on!v manner
a settlement from the Utilities Com-jin which the work eyor cou!(, hc per
pany for the death of the animals. ; formed by the city government.
When the insurance was settled. Mr
Tinsley went to the Mayor and asked
for a proposition.
"Two hundred dollars!" replied the
Mayor.
Mr. Tinsley recommended that the
$200 be paid, making $000 the Mayor
got for the two dead animals.
He took $210 of this money to Cairo
where he purchased two trained fire
horses that were discarded by the de
partment there on account of the in
stallation of motor trucks.
These animals he has arranged to
dispose of for $fi00 when the motor
fire apparatus is delivered. The Mayor
virtually completed arrangement
whereby the Robinson Company will
leave the old wagon fire truck here and
take the fire horses for the $G00 al
lowed on the new machine. The third
horse that will be included in this
deal cuts little fijrure, the Mayor de-
dares.
His first deal, allowing $200 each as
the value of the horses killed, netted
$200 profit and his second deal boosts
the sum to $S00.

EXTEND MAIN ST.
BY CONDEMNATION
Mayor Sajs Property Owners
Must Pay Cost, Not
the City.
The extension of Main street two
blocks south of Independence tret, as
a result of the fire that destroyed the
Cape City Steam Laundry building, is
in the same status as it was before the
fire. Mayor Kage declared last night.
The extension will have to be done
j "The work will have to be done, if at
all, in the regularly constituted way,"
the Mayor declared, "and it ultimately
will be a matter to be put through the
courts.
"Two years ago the matter was
taken up when the property owners
along the route of the proposed strret
extension, made a written proposition
that is on record in the City Hall. They
asked the city to pay them for the
land to be used and also pay for the
pavement of the street.
"I will say now that the city is not
paying for any streets. It is a
precedent that will not be created in
the first place, because if we pay for
one street, we will have to pay for i ;
all, and under the law, the property
owners to be benefited have to bear the
burden of expense.
"I think that a benefit district will
have to be created by a commission
appointed by the court to stand the ex
pense of the street opening, just as the
benefit districts are being made in the
West End where streets are being
widened.
"Two years ago, when the matter
was up, the property owners wanted
(to have it all their on way, so they
got nothing. One man wanted us to
pay him $10,000 for his corner and
the other prices asked were high in
the thousands.
"Personally, I think the proposal
made in the editorial columns of The
Tribune is worthy and the street
should be extended, but it truest be
done right."

After an illness of less than a week,

to cau.-e alarm. His brother. Judge
Wi'liam B. Schaefer, president of the
Cape Exchange Bank, had been in
formed that his brother was slightlv
indisposed from rheumatism, but as I
he had ben subject to these attacks I
for years, his relatives believed he j
would soon recover. i
Mr. Schaefer's illness did not become
serious until Wednesday night, and it '
was not believed that his life was in
danger then. But he failed to rally
and continued to grow weaker until the
end came.
"I first learned that my brother was
! suffering from rheumatism about one !
week ago, said Judge Schaefer last
evening. ''This information came from I
a neighbor of my brother. As he said
my brother was only slightly indis- j
nosed, I did not give the matter much
thought. j
"He had long suffered from kidney j
the kidneys. This was responsible for
his death. But this chronic ailment
was aggravated by the rheumatic con- !
dition."
Henry Schaefer was 40 years old,
and was bo it. on a farm just out of
Appleton. The Schaefer family were
pioneers in that section of the county,
and Mr. Srhaefer was known by every
one in that immediate locality and had
a vast number of friends in every part
of the county. His mother, Mrs.
Marie Schaefer, who is past 76 years
of age, lives with another son, Adolph,
on the old Schaefer homestead. She
enjoying excellent health despite
her advanced age.
In addition to his widow, Mr. Schaef
er leaves six children: Ruth, Dorothy,
Henry, Mary, Nellie and a baby son,
Charles. The eldest is Miss Ruth, who
is hardly seventeen years of age. Three
brothers and two sisters also survive.
They are: William B. Schaefer, of this
city; Adolph, a farmer near Appleton;
Dr. R. S., of Dallas, Tex.; Mrs. Mar
tha Telle, of Kimmswick, Mo., and Mrs.
Amelia Weinhold, of Rochester, Minn.
The funeral of Mr. Schaefer will
take place from the Lutheran Church
at Union Town, a short distance from
Appleton. In this church Mr. Schaefer
was- baptized and confirmed and for
thirty years had been one of its most
influential members. The Rev. Otto
Heuschen, pastor of the church, will
deliver the funeral oration. While the

sors are keeping the French people in
ignorance of the fact that they can
have peace with France as well as
Belgian soil freed of Germans without
shedding another drop of blood. Philip
Sheidemann, Socialist leader and sup
porter of Chancellor von Bethmann-
j Holhveg, declared in a most important
session of the Reichstag.
The meeting was marked by the an
nouncement from National " Liberal
Basserman that the main committee of
the Reichstag had reached no conclu
sion in its decision of the question of
reviving submarine warfare, but hail
agreed that there shuold be no public
discussion of the question in the Reir-h-stag.
What is French will stay French
what is Belgian will stay Belgian, an I
what is German will stay German
this is the main basis upon which
peace will be constructed, said Sheid
mann. "But since Lloyd-George and Briand
preach war until the bitter end, the
Chancellor is unable to talk peace. The
nations want peace. If the contrary is
said in any country, then it is an ab
solute swindle."
