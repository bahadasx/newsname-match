The sensation created yesterdav
vhen the U-53 quietlv slipped into
Newport harbor and as quietlv slipped
nvay three hours later, was less than
he shock in shipping circles when
vireless report of submarine attacks
>egan to come into the naval radio
stations just before dav today.
Air Filled With Warnings.
Within a few minutes the air was
iterall.v charged with electricity a<
wireless messages of warning were
broadcasted along the coast.
The submarine, or submarines, had
taken a pos-Jtion directlv in the steamer
lanes where they could hardly miss
anything bound in for New York, or
bound east from that point.
Vessels of the Entente Allied nations
and neutral bottoms carrying
contraband of war scurried to get
within the three-mile limit of the
American shore. Several that were
following the outside course shifted
and made for the inside lane. The
Stephano. of the Red Cross Line, however.
was caught outside the neutral
gone. The destruction of this vessel
was perhaps the hi"gest prize of the
lay. The craft had been sold to the
Russian government and would have
been used as an ice-breaker after her
present trip.
Throughout the day and un to late
tonight none of the patrolling fleet
maintained by the British and French
to protect their own shippintr and
American ships carrying munitions C
war had been sighted. Frantic appeals
were sent to Italifax, but for a time
the commander of the British naval
station there refused to divulge what
steps were being taken to meet the
submarine attack.
