NUMBER 41
A Banner Year
"The farmers of the Potlatch
section are engaged in completing |
their harvest operations in what is.
cfceir banner year as far as prc- !
' 'Vtion and prices are concerned," :
said County Commissioner LeRoy :
J. Southwick, who arrived in Lew- j
iston Monday from Southwick to j
attend the regular quarterly meet
ing of the board.
''It has been an unusual year
from a number of standpoints,"
continued Mr. Southwick, "but in
the end our farmers will realize
more from their land than in any
single season since the country was
settled. The grain threshing was
completed last week, the bean
threshing will be completed this
week and none of the crops have
been damaged by frost.
"The yeild of spring grain was
above normal while the fall sown
grain was a little below normal
but the prices secured have made
possible the greatest returns the
farmers have ever received for
their grain crops. The bean yield
is one of the best the country has
ever known and a record price is
being secured this season. It is
estimated the average production
will be little short of 1,000 pounds
of beans per acre and a crop of 34
acres grown by Nels Longteig re
turned an average of nearly 1,200
pounds per acre. The price being
paid this year ranges from $5.50
to $5.60 per hundred which means
the farmers have secured big profits
from their summer fallow crops.
"The farmers of the Potlatch
section have been engaged in grow
ing beans on their summer fallow
land for the past several years but
it was only a few years ago that
no thought was given to growing
crops on summer fallows. This
change in farming plans has ma
terially increased the revenues from
the land and has also served to im
prove the soil. More people are
employed in caring for the land
and in harvesting the crops and
better conditions have resulted
generally.
"The continued rains during the
spring caused a general apprehen
sion that the spring crops could not
be seeded and then the unusually
cool summer had the farmers badly
j
scared on the score that their beans
would not ripen. Favorable
weather, however, prevailed during
the latter part of the summer and
it has been a good many years
since more favorable harvest weath- J
er has been experienced. There :
were but a few days that threshing j
was delayed because of the rain
and now with the bulk of the crops
in the sacks and much of the crop
^gold, there can be no doubt as to
the season being the best the fami
nes of the Potlatch have ever ex
perienced."—Tribune.
Commissioners In Session
The board of county commission- '
ers of Nez Perce county convened !
Monday at Lewiston in regular
quarterly session and the entire day
was given over to the auditing of
the quarterly bills, salaries of offi
cers and the reports of road over
seers. The board will transact :
,
much routine business during the
October session but little important
road work is being considered,
Approximately one-half of the roads
of the county are now included in ;
independent highway districts over
which the county board has no
county
jurisdiction in the matter of roads.
The creation of the higdway dis
tricts relieves the commissioners of
much work and allows
for handling the other departments
of the county's business.
Roy Plummer went to
Thursday on business.

Although anti-air craft gunners dropped two huge Zeppelins which did considerable damage near London, Germany followed
up her loss with another raid. The tieup of the traction systems of New York city has brought into use novel conveyances for

The king of Greece became convinced of the necessity of joining the allies in war after ex-Premier Venizelos threatened rev

Archie Long started to school
Rl on day, thus increasing the enroll
J ment in that grade up to twenty
: five.
j The gi r i s of the third and fourth
grades are organizing a sewing class
this week. This will keep them
bus y during the long winter months.
Lewiston, Idaho, Oct. 8.—William
Oliver, the one-armed junk collec
tor, who was last week stricken
with paralysis affecting his remain
ing arm, and who had his reason
unbalanced to such an extent that
he was arraigned on a charge of in
sanity and ordered committed to
the state sanitarium at Orofino, let
drop muttered words while held at
the county jail which led the officers
to suspect that he was possessed of
some means.
A minute search was made of his
clothing, disclosing a small red
pocket book containing $700 in cur
I rency which had been sewed up and
then securely sewed within the lin
ing of the vest. Further search
disclosed $355 in currency and gold
sewed in different places in his coat
and $60 in his trousers, making a
total of $1115 which he was carry
ing on his person.
The money was turned over to
John L. Chapman, county treasurer,
who will be appointed as his guar
dian. The old man had lived in
Lewiston for 16 years in what was
thought to be abject poverty, mak
ing his living by picking junk thru
the residence districts, and had at
times solicited charity, which has
been freely extended.

Cheese Making in Latah
There are wonderful possibilities
for cheese-making in Latah county
and other sections of northern
Idaho in the opinion of E. F, Goss,
the expert in this line who has just
been added to the faculty of the
University of Idaho, department of
agriculture.
North Idaho is particularly fav
ored as a dairy section in the opin
ion of Mr. Goss. In his talk he
laid special emphasis on the remark
ably low percentage of tuberculosis
among the cattle of this section.
This is due, he thinks, to the pure
air and equitable climate. It gives
north Idaho a tremendous advan
tage over cheese-making sections of
the east where tuberculosis among
the cows is a serious problem.
Then the facilities for getting the
raw product to the cheese factory
free from impurities; the cool
nights reducing the ice bill and en
abling the cairy men to handle
their product well and at a mini
mum cost; and the abundance of
good cattle feed, especially alfalfa
and clover, give this section many
important advantages. The chief
advantage of cheese-making over
handling the dairy product in other
forms is that the cheese can be
stored and can be shipped long dis
tances to market, factors that must
be considered in such sections as
Latah county.
Mr. Goss says he would not ad
vise the establishment of a cheese
factory with fewer than 200 cows,
and these should be located within
a radius of five miles to make pos
sible successful co-operation and
the prompt handling of the raw
product.
Real Estate Deals

have been made here during the

Cordelia J. Wetmore
Cordelia J. Wetmore was born
March 3, 1828 in the state of New
York. She died October 9, 1916 at
the home of her daughter, Mrs.
Wm. F. McClelland, near South
wick, Idaho, at the age of 88 years.
She lived a long useful life
according to the true principles of
Christianity, helping to lighten the
load of others along the wav and
finding many an opportunity for
such work in the early pioneer days
of Iowa, where her family of six
children grew to manhood and wom
anhood.
Her husband and two sons have
preceded her to the beautiful
beyond. She leaves two sons
and two daughters, thirta*n
grandchildren 1 and fifteen great
grandchildren. The children are:
Mrs. A. W. Hawley, of College
Springs, Iowa; O. C. Wetmore of
Blanchard, Iowa; Hugh Wetmore
and Mrs. Wm. McClelland of South
wick, Idaho.
Short funeral services were con
ducted at the house by G. W. Ben
jamin, using as lesson Psalms 23,
"Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy laden and I will give
you rest."
The remains were taken to Iowa
for burial, where she was laid at rest
beside her husband.
While she will be missed by loved
ones and especially so by her faith
ful daughter, Mrs. McClelland and
her family, yet they truly did all
that loving hands could do and they
have that hope of meeting to part
no more.—Special correspondent.

Dr. Baker Writes Book
"Sheep Diseases," by Dr. E. T
Baker of Moscow, has just been
published as Number 12 of the
Veterinary Medicine Series being
issued by the American Journal of
Veterinary Medicine of Chicago.
Advance copies of the book have
just been received by the author,
who is informed that the first
edition of six thousand copies will
soon be completed.
Dr. Baker was selected to write
the volume on sheep diseases by D.
M. Campbell, editor of the Amer
ican Journal, on account of his hav
ing been many years a resident of
the sheep raising states, and having
served the government some time
as sheep inspector. He has won a
wide reputation as a writer on live
stock by his contributions to the
most important and popular agri
cultural and vetetinary periodicals.
His new book is handsomely
n.ade on enamel paper, substantial
ly bound in cloth, and illustrated
with a wealth of halftone engrav
ings and colored plates. Topics are
well classified, and discussed in the
lucid and easy style which have
made Mr. Baker's writings so ac
ceptable to publishers and readers.
A number of the illustrations are
local, one snowing the home of Mr.
and Mrs. J. R. Brown southwest of
town.
Speaking of sheep raising in the
Inland Empire. Dr. Baker said;
"Few people in the Palouse
country realize Idaho is the fourth
sheep state in the union; its 3,100,
000 head having a value of over
$17,350,000. With wool over 30
cents and advancing faster than
citv taxes, sheep have been bring
ing almost incredible prices. Last
month at Salt Lake City the Butter
j field Livestock company, of Weiser,
Idaho, sold a pure-bred Rambouillet
for an even thousand dollars,
while another Idaho firm, Laidlaw
& liinsey of Muldoon, paid $675 for
a Hampshire. Even prices asked
for common sheep are enuf to give
the average pocket book the St.
Vitus dance.
"It is estimated that six hundred
million of the world's population
wear wool, the balance being a
dorned in furs, feathers, silk, cotton
and sunburn. If the price of
clothes keeps advancing the way
they have for the past year, and
wooi in proportion, a small flock of
sheep will be worth money.
"Practically every rancher can
keep from ten to a hundred sheep
on a small farm and not miss the food
the animals consume in a year.
They will pay mighty good inter
est."^—Star-Mirror.

W. P. Abrahamson Drowned
a
Miss Clarice Abrahamson, one of
the Kendrick teachers, received
word Monday of the death of a
brother who was drowned in a lake
near Newport, W'ash. The follow
ing account of the accident was
taken from the Spokesman Review:
William P. Abrahamson, age 25,
book-keeper for the Inland Seed
company, W1216 Fifth avenue, and
resident of Spokane for the last
eight years, was drowned in Half
Moon lake, 17 miles northeast of
Newport in Pend Oreille county
about 3:30 p. m. Sunday, when he
fell from a raft while fishing. Mr.
Abrahamson was well known in the
city and had been employed by the
Inland Seed company for the last
seven years.
In company with D. W. Dwight,
a realty dealer in the Falls City
block, Abrahamson left Spokane at
4 a. m. Sunday to spend the day
fishing. When the fatal accident
occurred he was on a raft about 20
feet from where Dwight was stand
ing on a log.
"I was fiishing at the time, and
hearing a splash in the water, look
ed around and saw his hands and
legs out of the water," said Mr.
Dwight upon his return yesterday.
"He went down immediately and
came up again, but, although he
was a swimmer, he did not try to
make a move. I snagged the raft
with my hook and pulled it to the
log, then got on it, and. going to
the spot, pulled the body out of the
weeds with my pole.
"I then called for help and start
ed for shore. Three men who had
been fishing came to the place at
once, but all efforts at resuscitation
were without results. The coroner
at Newport was notified and the
body taken to that place. The
body will be brought to Spokane.
"When I explained to the coroner
and a physician in Newport the in
cident they said it must have been
heart failure or apoplexy."
Mr. Abrahamson is survived by
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. T. '
Abrahamson, a brother and two sis
ters, all in Moscow, Idaho, and two
sisters, Miss Julia Abrahamson and
Mrs. C. J. Erickson, at E623 Bridge
port avenue, Spokane.
Funeral services will be held at
10 a. m. tomorrow from Smith &
Co.'s chapel, after which the body
will be sent to Moscow for inter
ment.
Karl Dittebrandt, who was Mr.
Abrahamson's roommate and closest
friend for a number of years, was
killed 18 months ago in an automo
bile accident at Colfax. The shock
of this accident caused Mr. Abra
hamson to suffer an attack of apo
plexy and some of his friends be
lieve a recurrance caused his death
He was a strong boxer, tennis play
er and all around athlete and that
he made no struggle after falling
from the raft causes the conclusion
that he was overcome before enter
ing the water.
Camp Fire Girls
The Camp Fire Girls held a meet
ing last Friday evening, this being
the first meeting since the summer
vacation. The organization is still

enthusiasm was lost during their
idle months. A weinnie roast is
being planned for next week, if the
weather is permissible, and the
girls anticipate a rousing good time.
It has been decided that the
meetings this winter will be held
Friday evenings at 7:30 unless some
other attraction prevents when they
