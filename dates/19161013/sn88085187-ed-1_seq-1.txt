U-53 REPORTED BACK
TELLS
ROSSI
STORY
By L. D. Angevine
WALLACE, Idaho, Oct. 11.—
The wheels of justice now are
grinding full speed to determine
whether Herman J. Rossi, one of
Idaho's most prominent men was
Justified in killing Clarence Dal
qulst, because of alleged intimacy
between Dalqulst and Rossi's
young wife-
lit building a theory, of tempo
rary insanity, tlie defense today
called a dozen Wallace citizens
who aaw Rossi while on his way
from his home to the hotel where
he shot Dalquist.
Some of these said that he
seemed to be preoccupied. Others
said they thought he was drunk.
All declared that his face was
haggard and worn and ihat he
stared straight ahead.
Sudden patlioji was injected
Into the murder trial when De
fense Attorney Cray read two of
Rossi's letters, written while
Mrs. Rossi was in California, with
her nipid, Mrs. Ruth Melville,
seeldiiK health and freedom from
her liquor craving.
The first letter was addressed
to Mrs. Melville and had to do
with an enclosed check, which
Rossi asked her to expend in the
purchase of a present for Mrs.
Rossi, on March 16, their wed
ding anniversary.
The letter to his wife began:
"My dearest Wife: On this anni
versary of our wedding, may your
cup of happiness he tilled with
contentment." And it continued
with tender words of love, with
every expression of hope for her
future happiness.
As Gray read it, Rossi's eyes
suddenly swam iv tears, and he
bowed his head. Hefore it was
done, Gray's voice broke. Jury
men stirred uneasily. Noses were
blown throughout the court room.
DesirilM's Wife's Craving.
Tlie letters were introduced
while Mrs. Melville was on the
stand, detailing the story of her
years with Mrs. Rossi, while she
helped the young wife fight off
her mad craving for Intoxicants.
She testified that Rossi was a
loving husband.
In lhe years you were with Mrs.
Rossi, did you ever know her to
be guilty of any infidelity?'" ask
ed Gray.
"No," said Mrs. Melville. "And
Mr. Rossi was devoted to her.'
Tells Kossl Falsehood.
She told how Mrs. Rossi drank
cocktails while attending dinners
in California, and how she be
came so Intoxicated she went to a
Turkish bath and was unable to
leave.
She told of their return to Wal
lace. Rossi asked her if his wife
had been drinking. She evaded
him.
Home Seemed Happier.
"Tell me the truth," command
ed Rossi. So then she told htm.
She described the day Rossi
started for Boise, the last day he
was to recognize his wife as mean
ing anything to him.
The Monday following Mrs.
Rossi drove tp Burke. Returning,
she seemed to have liquor. Tues
day night, Mrs. Melville went to
a movie.
When she returned there was a
crowd In the kitchen.
"Gabe Dalqulst was there," she
said. "The party lasted until 2
or 3 in the morning. Next morn
ing, the house was In disorder,
empty bottles were lying around,
and the beds were disarranged.
"Later there ensued some kind
of dispute between Mrs. Rossi and
Dalqulst. I don't know what hap
pened, hut she called me. I found
the bed broken down, glass brok
en, and a cut glass piece smashed.
Both were undressed.
Ijoees the Doors.
• "Thursday morning 1 served
breakfast to both of them, In bed.
Dalqulst left the house an hour
afterwards. When he returned I
told him he couldn't come in, that
I would keep the doors locked.
"I first saw Mr. Rossi about
G:.1(l or a quarter to six."
Throughout Mrs. Melville's re
cital, Rossi sat with his head
bowed, deep, tired lines on his
face. At times he covered hit
oyes with hits hands.

GIVE THE BILLION-DOLLAR TRAIN
A TEN BILLION-DOLLAR WELCOME!
Tlie Women's Hughes Special Train which will reaeli Tacoma Fri
day evening is going to be a fine show, ami we ought all to turn out and
see it. and attend the reception at the Elks' Club.
It will bring a lot of fine women, many of whom we have heard of,
but never had a chance to see.
It does seem awfully rude and unappreciativc of National Republi
can Chairman Willcox and the local G. (). P. leaders to have so explic
itly washed their hands of responsibility for tbe Golden Special. And the
anxious notices that have been appearing in the papers, to the effect that
the Woman's Party is in no way connected with the train, have added a
delightful element of mystery to the whole situation.
With tbe republicans shying and the Woman's Party balking, the
Woman's G. O. P. train must be accounted for on the score of sheer
philanthropy.
And it certain was philanthropic of those rich eastern women to send
a missionary caravan like this out 11 us in the ignorant west.
It must have cost an awe-inspirinj lot of money.
Of course, money doesn't mean much to some of tbe backers of the
Golden Sjiecial.
Here is a partial list of its spans >rs. as compiled hy tbe Toledo News-
Bee.
MRS. O. H. P. BELMONT, ratfd at $000,000.
MARY HARRIMAN RUMSEY, heiress to $75,000,000 of the
wealth of E. H. Harriman.
MRS. PHOEBE HEARST, mother of William Randolph Hearst,
with Mexican and other mines and h'anlalions -.-allied at $30,000.00.
MRS. H. O. HAVEMEYER, widow of the sugar trust magnate,

she declared.
It probably is a fact that the multi-millionairesses arc not themselves
traveling on the train. They are siimly putting their money into it —why,
they and their husbands know best—and the other women are doing the
work.
Too bad. We would have liked to see them also. Rut to most of us,
who never expect to have even $50,000 in bur own names, it will be
quite a spectacle anyway.
We're going to vote for Wilson, of course; but there's no reason at all
