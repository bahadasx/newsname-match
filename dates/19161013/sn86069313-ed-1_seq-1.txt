the exclusive use of runaway couples
and ho performed the marriage
ceremony for G,Mi couples. Most
of the couples came from states
whero the laws prohibited tho mar
rlagn of persons under twenty-one

tho Tennessee legislature to put a

Keeps Matrimonial Hotel.
Parson Burroughs' hotel was de
signed expressly for tho convenience
of eloping couples. Every room In
It is a bridal chamber. It stands
squarely on the lino between Vir
ginia and Tennessee, which runs
throiiRh Ilrlstol, ho that half of tho
hotel Is In one state and half in an
other. Klopera from ono of the two
'states had only to cross the hall to
he within the jurisdiction of the
other.
Burroughs performed marriages
tinder every conceivable circum
stance In a carriage racing through
tho streets at night with an Irate pa
rent in full pursuit, with the couple
standing tn tho middle of a street
car running along the boundary
Hue, with hands clasped across the
boundary lino, the bridegroom in
one stato and tho brldo tn another.
Ho had been In It long enough to
marry tho children of couples who
first came to him. Fully ninety per
cent of tho couples ho married were
elopers. They represented many
states Virginia and West Virginia,
Kentucky, the two Carollnns, Geor

All of the elopers coining by train

It frequently happened that the

LABOR PAPER PAYS

OK OF NEW VOKK.
(By F. I). Vanover.)
Louisville, Ky., Oct. 10. Thought
ful worklngmen and members of tho
various labor organizations here are
expressing hut little confidence In
the policies advocated by President
Wilson today, in view of the strongly
expressed opinions Of contempt for
labor, of Professor Wilson of yester
day. Instead, they are replying; In
constantly Increasing numbers on the
favorable public record of Charles
Evans Hughes, of whom the Legis
lative Labor News, of Now York, on
'October 10, 1910, paid tho follow
ing tribute:
"Now that Governor Hughes has
I returned from politics and ascended
J to a place on the highest judicial tri
bunal in the world, the fact can be
acknowledged without hurting any
body's political corns, that he was
the greatest friend of hlbor laws that
ever occupied the governor's chair at
Albany.
"During his two terms he has sign
ed fifty-six labor laws, Including
among them tho best labor laws ever
enacted in this or any other State.
Ho also urged the enactment of labor
laws In his message to the legisla
ture, oven going so far as to placo
the demand for a labor law In one
of his messages to an extra session
of tho legislature. Only 102 labor
laws have been enacted In this (Stato
since Its erection in 1777 lu 133
years. One-third of these, exceeding
In quality all of tho others, have
been enacted and signed during Gov
ernor Hughes' term of threo years
and nine mouths."
Read what Professor Wilson had
to say beforo ho became a politician
and dared to freely express his con
tempt of labor bodies, and compare
with tho following expressions from
Mr. Hughes when ho was Governor
of Now York:
"Tho Intorests of labor are the In
terests of all tho people and the
protection of tho u age-earner In tho
security of his llfo and health by
overy practicable means In one of the
most sacred trusts of socloty.
"Under wlbo leadership, with
statesman like guidance, with n sin
cere Intention to promote tho bene
fit of tho community and to secure
honorable progress, tho mission of
labor organizations is ono of tho fin
est that any association of men
could guard. Tho worklngman Is
not asking anything ho should not
have. All ho wants Is u squnro

TO BEN JOHNSON
ISSUES STKINGENT AND POINTED
REPLY TO 4TH DISTRICT
CONGRESSMAN.
A 'RED BLOOD DEMOCRAT
Ghcs Reasons For Close of The
Hurt ford JleraldS Column!, To
Ills Articles.
To the Democratic voters of the
Fourth Congressional District:
A reply to the speech of Hon. Ben
Johnson, when In Hartford, Sept.
18, 1916.
In the first place Mr. Johnson made
a labored defense of the Roman
Catholic confessional, which nobody
had attacked but which everybody
knows was not born of a spirit of
Christianity.
He further says that: "Most mu
nicipalities have their own public
hospitals and orphan asylums. There
is not now and never has been-any
such institution in the District of
Columbia."
Which is absolutely false, for I
have beforo mo H. R. 15774 passed
by tho last Congress, being an act
providing for tho expenso of the DIs-
' trlct of Columbia for tho year end
. ing June 30, 1917, In which tho
government and the District share
equally. This bill shows seven In
stitutions as follows, whose olllcers
from superintendent to common ser
vant, nro paid from tho Treasury
and aro public Institutions pure and
slmplo: .
Board of Children's .Guar
dians $13,430.00
Homo for ex-Union Sol
diers aud Sailors C.940.00
Homo for Aged and In-
llim 10,292.00
House of Detention .... 14,330.00
Municipal Lodging Huso. 4,190.00
For new ono . . 40,000.00
Tuberculosis Hospital... 19,800.00
Washington Asylum and
Jail . 30,210.00
A total of $144,282.00
With all these public institutions
for tho care of indigents, do you sco
tho need of tho government paying
the great Roman Catholic Provldonco
Hospital tho sura of $1GS, 127.00 In
tho year 1907?
True, his list of non-Catholic In
stitutions which Includes tho above
public ones, Is correct, except, tho
Georgetown University Hospital,
jvhlcu Is Roman Catholic and draws
$6,000.00 tn tho above bill, but not
a single ono of them Is operated by
a protectant church of any kind nnd
thoro Is no such Institutions support
ed by tho government.
I havo gotten my Information only
from tho Congressional Record and
the Treasury Department, so they
are the "bigots" Mr. Johnson refers
to, I presume.
Mr. Johnson has never answered
my question "nut says I "claim" (?)
to bo n Democrat. I havo always
been and ever expect to be a red
blood American Democrat, who has
novcr taken 'an oath or bowed the
knee to a foreign King or Potentate.
The Herald man has been passing
Judgment on me, now I want to
pass ono on him. He holds an ap
pointment under Mr. Johnson, and
that has closed his paper to the
truth.
Now, Mr. Democratic Voter, you
see to It that Mr. Johnson stays at
homo and In two years wo will elect
a genuine American Democrat to
Congress, who has no other political
ties.
Yours for the success of Woodrow
Wilson.

BRITISH GOVERNMENT
STOPS NEWS SERVICE
INTERNATIONAL NEWS DENIED
FURTHER USE OK CABLES
CHARGE BAD FAITH.
London, Oct. 11. The morning
newspapers publish in conspicuous
places the official order denying to
the International News Service fur
ther uso of the Official Press Bureau
and the use of cables and all other
facilities for transmission of news
because of Its "garbling of messages
and breach of faith." The order ap
pears under such headings as "No
British News for Hearst," "News
Made in America," and "American
Agency's Garbling of Messages."
In an extended editorial the Times
says:
American Press Praled.
"While we rejoice that our Gov
ernment has inflicted proper punish
ment upon an unscrupulous news
agency, we trust that the measures
taken will not be regarded by tho
people of this country as involving
any slur upon tho character and con
scientiousness of the United States
press as a whole. The reputation of
the great majority of American jour
nals for fairness and honesty stands
above reproach and it has again and
again been vindicated during the
war. We Imagine, indeed, that the
American press and public will be
grateful to the British authorities for
having punished wrongdoers and es
pecially for having made public the
grounds for the action taken.
"The dissemination of accurate
news Is at all times a matter of high
Importance. We trust our authori
ties will extend their laudable ener
gy In other directions also and visit
with similar punishment any other
news agencies or Journals which may
be convicted of publishing garbled In
telligence from this country."

6 STEAMERS SUNK
OFF U. S. COAST
GERMAN SUBMARINES DESTROY
BRITISH, DUTCH AND NOR
WEGIAN VESSELS.
ALL GIVEN WARNING
Crews Are Rescued By Atucriwun
Destroyers When News Is
Flashed.
Boston, Oct. 8. Tho submarine
arm of tho Imperial navy ravaged
shipping off the eastern coast of the
United States to-day.
Four British, one Dutch and ona
Norwegian steamer were sent to taw
bottom or left crippled dorelicts off
Nantucket Shoals.
To-night under the light of tho
hunter's moon tho destroyer flotilla,
of the United States Atlantic fleet!
was picking up passengers and crews
of the destroyed vessels and bringing1
them Into Newport, R. I.
So far as known there was no loss
of life, though at a late hour the
crew of tbr British steamer Kings
ton had not been accounted for.
A submarine held up tho Ameri
can steamer Kansan, bound from
New York for Genoa, with steel for
the Italian Government, but later, on
establishing her identity, allowed th
American to proceed. The Kansan
came Into Boston harbor late to
night for her usual call here.
Relieved To B U-53.
The hostile submarine is believed
to tho the U-53, which paid a call to
Newport yesterday and disappeared
at sunset. Some naval men, ho tr
over, declared that at least two sub
marines are operating close to the
American shore, though outside the
three-mile limit.
The record of submarine warfare,
as brought to land by wireless dis
patches follows:
The Strathdcne, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Crew taken aboard Nantucket Shoals'
lightship and later reported to New
port by torpedoboat destroyers. The
Strathdeno left New York yesterday
for Bordeaux, and was attacked at 8
a. bi.
The West Point, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket,
crew abandoned the ship in small
boats after a warning shot from,
submarine's gun. Olllcers and men
were taken aboard a destroyer. The
Vessel was attacked at 10:45 a. m.
She was bound from London for
Newport News.
Passenger Liner Sunk.
The Stephn'no, British passenger
liner, plying regularly between New
York, Halifax and St. Johns, New
Foundland, torpedoed southeast of
Nantucket, while bound for New
York. Passengers and crew, number
ing about 140, were picked up by
the destroyer Drayton and transferr
ed to the destroyer Jenkins. Tho at
tack was made at 4:30 p. m.
Tho Kingston, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk southeast of Nan
tucket. Crew missing nnd destroy

last night.
Tho Christian Kuudsen, Norwe
gian freighter, torpodoed nnd sunk

York Saturday for London.
Tho sensation created yosterday
when the U-53 quietly slipped' Into

, than tho shock In shipping circles
when wireless reports of submarluo
attacks began to come itito tho naval
radio stations Just before noon to
day. Within a fow minutes the air
was, literally charged with electrici
ty as wireless mossages of warning
wcro broadcasted along tho coast.
