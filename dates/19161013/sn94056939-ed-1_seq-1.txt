WHAT HAS A. A. JONES
DONE FOR NEW MEXICO
Every mnn in New Mexico who
is willing to work" in tlie Har
ness of the Democratic state
machino united in the early days
of this campaign in a skilfully
dov sed ta kimr " camnaurn
against Frank A. Hubbell. Each
and every one oi uio lciicrs
was instructed to say to his ncigh-
bor and friends. his acmiaintanccs
and to everyone who would listen
"it looks bad for Hubbell". They
talked this neat "sentiment" all
over the state and for a time
they talked themselves into a
real belief that it was true. The
Democratic managers were iubil
unt over what they deemed the
success of the sentiment".
They too were fooled by the
noise of their own people.
The Democratic managers have
waked up with genuine amaze
ment to the tact that Kepuul! .ans
throughout Wow Mexico are lined
up solidly behind frank A. Hub
bel. The only prominent oxee
tion is Gillie Otero whom Mr.
Hubbell once defeated in a party
contest and who sought revemre
by initiating the libel campaign
against the Republican candidate
for the United btatcs Senate.
Gillie is nroniincnt in this cam
naiirn wholly because some one
put him over on the Democratic
convention, ills own party had
long since discarded him.
Hut the thing which most
amazes the Democratic bosses.
including Mr. Jones, Is the fact
that tho people of this state have
dared to presume to inquire into
the Jones record. It has astound
ed the Democratic campaigners
that their assurance to tho peo
pie that Mr. Jonc3 is a high
minded statesman has been ciues
tioncd. They cannot understand
why the voters should bo do
manding to know what Jones
has done for New Mexico; what
has been his record in Washing
ton; what has been his record in
Las Vegas among his neighbors;
how they regarded him and his
right to standbeforo tho people
with n demand for the highest
honor the people have to bestow.
Yet they have been forced to
face the facts that the people are
asking these questions nnd they
are seeking to answer them by
increasing the output of noisy
and malicious slander. They are
trying tho old expedient of mak
ing a noise about tho other man
in an effort to distract from the
record of their own candidate.
A great many Domocrats be
lieved that Mr. Jones has gently
been instilling into thoir minds
over n number of years: that he
is a high principled, dignified
spotless citizen, high nbovo the
heads of ordinary men; thnt he
is a "born leader ; a man sought
by those in high places; a states
man. The Jones campaign for
the nomination was conducted
with consummate skill. Tho
candidate held aloof, so far as
the rank and file of his party
could ascertain, while tho strings
wore put out hero and there and
tied about tho various "bosses"
until in an auspicious moment,
they arose and acclaimed Mr.
Jones "our hero" and took tho
crowd along with them.
This system worked admirably
in tho nominating campaign,
where only parly leaders wcro to
bo considered, but now it has
come down to the question of re
cords and a comparison thereof.
Tho Democratic campaign mana
gers, and their newspapers, by
tho very malice of their attacks
on Mr. Hubbell have caused the
people to wake up and demand
to know tho facts in tho record
of Mr. Jones in public office and
in private inc. The Uemocrats
have answered that " Jones is a
statesman" and Jones himself
admits it. But they go no further
and tho voters havo now begun
to demand the reason why.
Mr. Hubbell is proceo( i g calm
ly on his way, carrying out his
campaign among tho neonlc. Ho
is not posing as anything but that
which he is; a plain, successful,
hard working business man. ac
customed to getting what he gofts
alter because he has the energy
and the ability to succeed. Hub
bell has sued millionaire Cutting
at Santa Fe for $50,000, because
cutting caused i s nancr to cn
Hubbell an embezzler and other
unpleasant names. Having at
tended to this detail in a business
like way. through competent at
torneys whom ho exnects to bo
successful, Mr. Hubbell has turn
ed his attention to the business
of tho campaign which in h's
case does not consist of prayerfu
eloquence from an elevation h'gh
above tho heads of tho peoi.e;
but of personal conversation with
the voters; of assurances to Re
publicans of his stand upon na
tional issues; of plain statements
of his position upon tho questions
before state and nation. Mr.
Hubbell is making a hr-r 1 cam
paign. Ho is seeing twice ns
many people every day as Mr
Jones is seeing. He is sailing
under no falso colors He is not
posing. He docs not fear his re
cord either in public or private
life. He is before tho people
with an honest, straightforward
desire to be elected and with the
knowledge in his own mind and
in the minds of all thoso who
know him, that if ho is elected
to tho United States Senate, ho
will make a useful senator to his
state and to his country.
In his home town of Albuquer
que, Mr. Hubbell's ancient enemy
tlie Journal has renewed Its
ancient slanders against Mr. Hub-
boll. Hut tho people of Albu
qucrquo havo wearied of tho
shifty political courso of the
Journal and of its ever recurring
assaults upon practically every
man who achieves a place inhe
public eve. Tho people know
Mr. Hubbell's whole life story.
They know how ho worked his
way up to commuicial succors.
They know his ideal family and
home life. They are personally
acquainted with his sons and
daughters. They do not lake
much stock in attacks tition him
which tnoy know personally to
be lies.
Tho Democratic talking organ
ization still is croaking its refrain
"It Looks Had For Hubbell"
They aro still "conceding every
thing but the Senator", but the
play is becoming very weak, for
everywhere they go to the Demo
cratic candidates and thoir mana
gers are seeing tho Hubbell
strength. They have learned
that it is not an easy matter to
beat a man whom tho people
know and respect, with a man
about whom tho people havo only
been told "hero is n statesman -voto
for him."
Up to this timo A. A. Jones
has brought to this campaign
nothing but n pose. Tho people
are demanding something more.
Thoy want to know moro about
tho man. Thoy want to know
his history. They want to know

STATEMENT
BY H. 0. BURSUM
To the People of New Mex
ico in Which Ho Makes
Some Clean Cut Statements
Concerning His Record.
BELIEVES OFFICIAL RECORDS
SHOULD BE PUBLISED
I believe In tho right of news-
papers to criticize tho acts of
public oilicials and to posa judg
ment based upon their records.
I believe It is right that news
papers should inquire into the
lltncss, the equipment and the
character of men who aro candi
dates for public office, and that
they should publish the facts.
I havo been averse to taking
any action which might seem to
restrict In any way the fullest
freedom of the newspapers of
Now Mexico to examine into and
criticize my own official record
and to pass upon my own fitness
as a candidate. For this reason
I havo maintained silence over n
number of years durintr which
viciously untruthful and malici
ously libelous attacks have been
made upon me by newspapers in
fluenced and . controlled by my
political enemies.
The Morning Journal of Albu
querque, owned b D. G. Grant
of Los Angeles, California, and
managed uy u. A. Mncpherson
of Albuquerque, has been most
active in this kind of assault up
on me, both as regards my public
acts and as to my private busi
ness and personal affairs. The
Journal's attacks began nearly
ten years ago nnd havu been con
tinued from to time "ever Bince.
I have never known and do not
know now any reason for the
peculiarly bitter and vicious hatr
ed which these men appear to
hold toward me. I have had
neither personal nor business re
lations with them and have never
wronged them. They have as
sailed mo relentlessly, without
truth, without honesty, without
principle, without justice.
Originally the Morning Journal
based its attacks upon me on
charges brought against me by
political enemies to the effect
that I had mace wiongful uso of
the funds of the Territorial I'cni
tentiaty during my service as
Warden of that, institution and
that I had destroyed or caused to
be destroyed certain of the re
cords of that irstitution.
Neither the political opponents
referred to nor this newspaper
which published their charges
without substantiation or iiimiirv
dared to bring their allegations
into any competent court. When
these charges v. ere made public
I took the only course open to a
citizen who hes been wronged.
I sought trial in a courtof justice
and was there cleared of every
trace of suspicion of wrongdoing
and my exoneration was written
into the court records of this
state in a decree which found
that every record book kept nt
tho penitential y during my war
denship was in evidence and in
tact, nnd which decreo gavo mo
a judgment and an execution
against tho Territory of New
Mexico in the sum of $-l,83a.IG,
which sum the court found to bo
due me in my final settlement
with tho Territory.
Five years ago I was nominat
ed by the Republican party as its
candidate for Governor of New
Mexico in the i rat state election,
Tho Morning Journal revived
its former libe jus publication
