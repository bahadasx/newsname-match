Mrs. Lifla G. Eaglisk.
On Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock at
the Congregational Church, Mrs. Lilla
G. English to whom Opie Read says,
"to write the history of a nation is a
broad art to sing the song of a soul is
a-divine gift, and you, then, are most
divinely gifted," will address the fath
ers and sons of Cresco and vicinity.
The subject will be "Playing the
Game." All men and all boys dver
twelve are cordially urged to to pres
«nt There will be no admission, but a
free will offering will be received for
Mrs. English.
"D*ve Darrah, Y. M. C. A. Secre
tary at Charles City says of this ad
dress, Mrs. English spoke to over 350
men and boys and did more real good
than any other person I have seen, and
I have seen a few of them in this line.
She will deliver "the goods" and any
town owes it to her men and boys to
secure her services.'' :*r
F. E. Finch, Pres. Board of Educa
tion of Fayette, says "I cannotfspeak
too highly of Mrs. English's work here
for both mothers and daughters, fath
ers and sons. She got at the heart of
things and held the reverent attention
of all. She is the mother of three
grown children and never offends, al
though she. speaks very plainly. It is
the unanimous opinion here that better
and higher ideals will be the result of
this great lecture."
Upon the request of the pastors, Mrs.
English has consented to talk at a
union meeting at the Congregational
Church, Sunday evening. A hearty in
vitation is extended to all members and
others in the community to attend the

John Liad at Decoral Satordij
John Lind, ex-Governor of Minne
sota, will speak in Decorah Saturday,
Oct 14th in behalf of President Wil
son. Mr. Lind is undoubtedly one of
the best speakers ever dated for a
speech in northeastern Iowa and will
doubtless meet with a reception in ac
cordance with the prominent position
he occupies in the political and busi
ness life of the nation. He will speak
in the afternoon in front of the Court
House, the weather permitting, other
wise in the Opera House.
Mr. Lind served six years in, Con
gress as a republican, changed his
party affiliation in 1896 and was elect
ed to Congress as a democrat. In
1898, he was elected Governor of Min
nesota as a democrat. Mr. Lind was
President Wilson's personal represent
ative at Mexico City during the most
critical period of the Mexican trouble
and will doubtless give some truthful
information obtained personally con
cerning the Mexican situation.

Carl Evans In die Field.
Carl Evans, of West Union, the
Democratic candidate for Congress in
this district, is making a thorough can*
vass of the district with a firm deter
mination to win, and is asking the earn
est support of every Democrat as well
as every Republican who wishes the
defeat of the present incumbent—en
cumbrance many feel would be the bet
ter word to use as more expressive of
the weight Mr. Haugen is upon the dis
trict aud especially upon the Republic
ans who would like to rid themselves
of this old man of the sea who is astrile
their backs.
Mr. Evans was in Cresco on Friday
last meeting numerous friends and sup
porters among both political parties
and on Monday spoke at Lime Springs
to an audience which nearly filled the
Opera house. Mr. Evans has a clean
cut personality which inspir«sconfid«nce
in the man {and in his ability to bring
credit to the district as its represent
ative, and that at the end of 18 years
of service he would have given the
people something be:ter than an annual
present of a package of cheap seeds at
government expense.
Birthday Celebration.
An occasion long to be remembered
was the celebration of Mrs. Hattie Cole
Kellow's eightieth birthday, when a
number of her old New Oregon friends
succeeded in surprising her, bringing
with them some beautiful gifts and a
bounteous picnic dinner. We were
asked to give to the guests the names
they bore in their girlhood days. They
were Helen Hunt, Lib Gallahan, Ada
McCulIoch, Kip and Fannie Moore,
Liszie Carpenter, Allie Mitchell, Hattie
McCollum, Julia and Susie Cole and
Ella Mead. The guests and hostess
enjoyed visiting about old times and
hope that Mrs. Kellow may enjoy many
more birthdays.

CRESCO, HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1916 $1.00 PER YEAR AS
The Meredith-Harding Debate.
Quite a number from this locality
went to New Hampton on Tuesday to
hear the two candidates for Governor,
Meredith and Harding, who were sched
uled to make^addresses at.New Hamp
ton's Civic Day Celebration which
brought out a crowd variously estimated
at between three and five thousand.
Meredith led with a 30 minutes talk,
Harding followed with 45 minutes, and
Meredith had 15 minutes in which to
reply.
Personally, we doubt the value of
such affairs, as the heat of debate sim
ply lines up the partisans of the con
tenders, but we feel that on the whole
Mr. Meredith, although a plain business
man and unaccustomed to public speak
ing, had the better of his opponent
throughout in their discussions of the
liquor and and road issues. At the
close of the debate, Mr. Meredith
offered to give his opponent another 30
minutes if he could have the same
amount of time, but Mr. Harding had
got enough and descended from the
platform. Mr Meredith has a fine per
sonality and gives the impression of
being a vigorous business man, perfect
ly fearless and tremendously in earn
est, while his opponent is an experienced
public speaker who knows all the tricks
of debate, making a very plausible
talk without definitely committing him
self, and with the oleaginous smile of
the professional politician who is more
interested in gaining" votes than in
upholding a principle.
Reporter Comstock is Attorney.
W. W. Comstock, for many years
past reporter in Judge Hobsbn's court,
passed the state bar examination at
Des Moines last week, and now is a
licensed attorney, ready for practice
whenever he gets his plans complete
for making the change from one occu
pation to the other. Mr. Comstock
does not know how long it will be be
fore he will begin active practice, but
when he does it is likely to be in West
Union. If he puts into the practice of
law the same efficiency he has in his
work as reporter, his success is a fore
gone conclusion. He hhs many warm
friends here and all over the district
who will wish for him abundant pro
fepnoaal sueceee.—W«n^7nion Argo.

Comment on Peter Collin's Lectures.
It was a great message.—Rev. Dfj
Evans, Congregationalist, AnamoMtl
Iowa.
It was a most delightful and interest^
ing lecture. —Rev. Dr. Hart, Baptfaf,
Eagle Grove, Iowa. ..•L's'**1
We are all indebted to Mr. Collins for
his great lecture.—Rev. J. E. Snyder,'
Presbyterian, Pendelton, Oregon.
I wish that every member of my con*
gregation could hear Mr. Collins lecture^
It was one of the greatest I ever heard.,
—Rev. Thomas Hambly, Methodist,'
Flagstaff, Arizona.
Peter Collins is a real orator, man ot
toil, outstrips many scholars as plat
form publicist for the K. of C. All in
all, his address was one of the best eves
delivered in Iowa City on similar or kin
dred themes. Mr. Collins will alwayn
be welcomed by the general public in
the University of Iowa.—Iowa City
Press.
•.::t
Mr. Collins is .doing a great construct
tive work for his country. His wide
and praictical reasons add to the inter
^t of his work. His record is lending
more weight each day to his opinions.
His sincerity and earnestness appeal to
all. He is eloquent, honest and a fluent
speaker who holds the wrapt attention
of his audience from the beginning.—
