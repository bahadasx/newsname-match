Nowaday! wa read a gnal deal in the papers about the high cost of woolens, the scarcity of
dye-atnffa, and the rise in labor -which is all true, and ranal neeeeaarily affeel the price of

But we were one of the few houses in the Ohio Valley who were fortunate enough to have

goods at the same old price as you paid last year. Many houses are obliged to raise their
prices, but we are not, and are going to give you the benefit of our early purchase.
All of our new Suits, Overcoats, Shoes, Hats and Furnishings art now in all dependable
