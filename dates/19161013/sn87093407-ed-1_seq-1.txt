Dry Squad Head
Again Blocked
For (he second time in two weeks, Sergeant Put
nam, head of the dry squad, escaped a carefully-la!£
traps late Thursday.
He was saved two weeks ago from a police plot
to compromise and transfer him to a beat "in the
woods" thru an open warnjng given directly to Mayor,
(jill during the dry mass meeting at the First Presby
terian church by Dr. M. A. Matthews.
How he escaped Thursday's plot, Putnam refused
to say Friday. He even denied having knowledge of
a second "frame-up" until convinced that friends of his
who helped him escape had told The Star about it.
"There was a deal framed to 'get' me," he said*
"It failed, and I do not care to talk about it further."
Whether the second recent effort to get Putnam
was made by members of the booze protection ring in
the police department or by bootleggers alone, isn't
known.
It is known, however, that it was planned to trans
fer Putnam from the dry squad October 1. These plans
have not been abandoned. But charges made in The Star
by Putnam that members of the police department wera
protecting bootleggers and gamblers and hampering his
work, served to delay the contemplated action.
Matthews Warns of Plot
"I want lo annouDre to thin

Hergt Putnam haa been hatched."
