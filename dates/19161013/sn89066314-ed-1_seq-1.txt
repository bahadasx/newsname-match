"Start Something" is Slogan

ONE WANTS A LAKE
Dr. Digges Suggests Mem
bership Exchanges With
Missouri Clubs.
There is a growing sentiment in
favor of a country club for Columbia
among the townspeople and faculty
members, according to opinions given
by business men today. The club.
taking on a more tangible forrofthey
say, and a meeting will beheld soon
to consider the forming of a tem
porary organization for an active con
sideration of the plan. A few weeks
may find the movement taking on
definite proportions.
"The idea of a country club is one
which has always appealed to me,"
George Reeder of the United States
Weather Bureau said, "and I believe
that Columbia was never more favor
able toward such a proposition. The
Columbia Club is temporarily dis
banded and there is no place one can
go for recreation. More than that
there is no place where one can take
a guest. Business men will find it
much more .convenient to talk busi
ness to out of town men over a
luncheon at the club than in their
offices or homes. It will be an ideal
place.
An Ideal Life, Says Iteedcr.
"There are also the social features
of a club which Columbia lacks utter
ly. It is a get-together place for the
members and this feature cannot be
duplicated in any other club. The
members can go to the club with
their wives and families. They can
play golf -and have dinner there. It
will be a place of relaxation. Per
sonally, I know of no other life that
can compare with such a club life.
"One feature which I would like to
see the Columbia country club em
body is that of a lake. The lake
could be stocked with bass and men
who do not play golf would be at
tracted to the club by the fishing. In
winter the lake could be used for
skating which would make the club a
year around affair instead of a sum
mer club. I do not think the people
of Columbia realize the benefits of a
country club or there would have
been one here before this time."
"Start Somelhlns,' Sajs .McAllister.
That a country club is more than
a possibility for Columbia is the
opinion of Berry McAllister. Colum
bia is just at the stage where one
could be supported that would be a
credit to the town, be thinks. He also
said that the town was fortunate in
having many desirable sites for a
country club close to the city. There
should be a meeting held to consider
the organization and make plans for
the club, he said.
"With the Columbia Club tempor
arily disbanded leaving the people
without a common social meeting
Place, I think that a country club is
almost a necessity," Dr. Charles
Digges said. "There are features in
a country club which cannot be ob
tained elsewhere. I think the club
should be located as near the town as
possible and with a view in the future
of being on an electric car line, for
there will be one built here eventual
ly. Urges Close Relation of Clubs.
"All that is lacking to have a coun
try club is someone to start the move
ment From the sentiment of those
with whom I have talked regarding
the club I know that there will be no
difficulty in organizing the club when
once the movement is started. There
is one feature which I would like to
see the local club use if it is organ
ized. It is a plan which is operated
In Illinois. The country clubs of
Bloomington, Peoria, Jacksonville,
Springfield and Decatur which have
all formed a system of Inter-exchange
f checks and membership. That is,

18 tn any of the five cities he Is at
liberty to go to the country club and
enjoy all of the privileges of the club.
He may take lunch there, buy cigars
r anything and sign the check. At
the end of the month, these checks are
exchanged and each club pays the
indebtedness of its members to the
others and charges it to their ac
counts. "Such a system could be worked

TO PRESENT U
IBRARY
BILL INLEGSUTURE
State Delegates Vote to Work
for a County System
in Missouri.
PLANS ARE DEBATED
Ward H. Edwards of Wil
liam Jewell College Heads
the Association.
The motion, made by Purd B.
Wright, librarlan-f the Kansas City
"Public Library, that a bill providing
for a county library system in Mis
souri be prepared by a committee and
approved and submitted to the Legis
lature was carried after a deliberate
discussion at the final meeting of the
.Missouri Library Association this
morning.
P. B. Blackw elder, assistant li
brarian of the St. Louis Public Li
brary, took issue with 5Ir. Wright,
saying that although he considered
the county library system a good
thing he was not in favor of the bill,
because, in lieu of the fact that the
state is one and one half million dol
lars behind in its revenue, the push
ing of the bill by the members of the
association would make them appear
as "mere enthusiasts."
5li8s Elizabeth B. Wales, secretary
of the Missouri Library Commission,
was of the opinion that "much wilder'
schemes than the proposed bill would
be placed before the Legislature at its
next meeting.
H. O. Severance, University li
brarian, declared himself in favor of
the bill, but said that he would like
to see it approved by the association
before it was submitted. 5Ir. Black
welder replied that he was not sure
that the bill was good, that it had
not been sufficiently considered and
that he did not think there was a pos
sibility of its being passed.
The following officers were elected
by the association; President. Ward H.
Edwards, librarian of William Jewell
College; first vice-president, 5Ilss 51a
ry E. Baker of the University Library;
second vice-president, 5Iiss Frances
Jarvis of the Park College Library at
Parkville; secretary, Harold L.
Wheeler, librarian of the Rollo School
of 5Dnes; treasurer, 5Iiss 5rargery
Quigley of the St. Louis Public Li
brary. H. O. Severance and Purd B.
Wright were elected delegates to the
American Library Association Con
vention, to be held next year.
5Iiss 5Iargery Quigley and J. B.
Powell, instructor in advertising of
the School of Journalism of the Uni
versity, presented opposing" Trews oa
the question of library advertising.
5Iiss Quigley upheld the more digni
fied method, as that of reaching per
sons within the library, and decried
the commercialized, sensational way
of advertising used by business
houses.
5Ir. Powell declared that effective
ness was more important to the ad
vertiser than loss of dignity and that
in all public work the propositions
must be presented to the people.
PUBLIC LIBRARY TO COME FIRST
Speakers at State Meetinp Emphasize
Columbia's Need of New Institution,
"All the women's clubs of Columbia
favor a library and I do not think
that any Columbia woman will allow
her husband to join a country club
until we have a city library, or vote
for a new city hall until we have
playgrounds and a swimming pool,"
said 5Irs. W. E. Harshe in an. address
before the 5Iissouri Library Associa
tion yesterday afternoon.
"We appealed to the Commercial
Club two years ago," said 5lrs.
Harshe, "and they told us that the
times were too hard. The donations
to the Hall Theater and the Boone
Tavern show that times are easier
now, and we expect to be able to raise
the' money for the library soon.
"The Tuesday Club was organized
in 1889 for two purposes, self culture
and service. We devoted all of our
spare time to organizing a library.
which now consists of 2,500 volumes
This may seem small to some of the
librarians present but when you stop
to think that it represents sacrifices
In the work and money of a small
group of women, it is not so small and
insignificant as It seems. The library
board appointed by the club has had
charge ofthe library work for the
last few years and will take the lead
ership in securing a city library. We

DIE IRE TRADE DAY
H. Levy Favors Making
Week a Semi-Annual
Affair.
"Columbia should have two Trade
Weeks each year one in the spring
and one in the fall. . It Is the best
way I have found to get customers
from far-away towns who would not
come to Columbia to trade otherwise.
I am in favor of making it a semi-annual
affair."
Such is the opinion of S. H. Levy of
the Levy Shoe Store after having seen
the results of the first four days of
Columbia's first Trade Week. The
opinion is based on the statements of
customers that they would not have
come to Columbia to make their pur
chases had they not read of the rail
road refund proposition in the 5Iis
sourian. Slips turned in up to 6 o'clock last
evening show that shoppers have
been drawn to Columbia from eighteen
towns and rural communities. These
places include one town in Audrain
County, two in Callaway County, and
fifteen in Boone County.
Not all shoppers are coming by
railroad. Automobiles are bringing
shoppers from many towns. The rail
road fare refund is paid just the same,
however. One shopper came twenty
four miles by motor, bought a large
amount of goods, presented his slip,
and had enough rebate to fill his gaso
line tank. "Well, this will just pay
for my dinner," said another shopper
who had driven to Columbia in his
motor, after collecting twenty-seven
cents rebate.
Any shoppers not having time to
present their refund slips in person
should send them to the Slissourian
by mall. The refund will be mailed
to their address. One woman from
5texico who was unable to reach the
5Ilssourian office has already taken
advantage of the refund in this way.
All out-of-town persons attend
ing the 5Iissouri-Washington football
game tomorrow afternoon should re
member that the Athletic Department
of the University is Included In the
list of establishments giving the re
bate, and should sec that the amount
paid for admission to the game Is re
corded on their slips. Business and
pleasure can be combined and the
benefits of Trade Week derived from
both.
Trade Week will end with the clos
ing of business houses tomorrow even

UTS JJfAT WAR
Chancellor Runs Into Snag
in Rhine Valley, Where
von Tirpitz Rules.
SENTIMENT IS HIGH
Westphalian Paper Says En
gland Must Ask Terms
To Obtain Peace.
By United Pre.
BERLIN, Oct. 13. Nearly every big
industrial enterprise in the Rhine Val
ley, the German Pittsburgh, favors
a ruthless submarine warfare, .re
gardless of the interest of the United
States. Chancellor Von Bethmann
Hollweg faces the opposition of the
industrial interests of both the Rhine
and Westphalian provinces, hotbeds
of Von Tirpitzism. They are now
centering their efforts on winning
Field 5Iarshal Von Hindenbcrg to
their cause.
"TJie war must be fought to a
finish," said the Westfaelische Zeit
ung, which thoroughly represents the
sentiment of the district in this re
spect. "Either Germany or England
must win."
Directors of Germany's steel trust
and other millionaires in the indus
trial country declare unreservedly
that Germany will not make peace
until England asks terms.
August Thyffen, German's Carnegie,
declared in an interview today that
since England is still the greatest
sea power it was necessary for Ger
many to operate submarines along the
American and Canadian coasts to
overcome this advantage.
"It can be imagined that this is un
comfortable for America, but it must
be remembered that we are at war
with Canada and this Is one of the
means of ending the war," he said.
"We cannot always make war as
America wants It." i
"Do you think Germany wants war
with America," he was asked.
"No, never!" was the emphatic re
sponse, "first, because we have
enough enemies and, second, because
in peace time our relations -with
America are always friendly and we
want them to continue so after the
war. We are most sympathetic to
ward America always. The world In
terests of both countries will develop
to peace."
Thyffen does not believe any im
mediate war will follow the present
war.
