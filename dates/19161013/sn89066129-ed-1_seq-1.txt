- Potatoes
Car on track Friday. October
13. Genuine Red River Ohios.
Oar advice to our customers and
the buying public is to lay in your
winter's supply out of this car, for
the potato situation this season is
the most serious this country has
experienced in years. When po-.
tato producing states like Michigan
and Wisconsin are buying potatoes
for their own use, that is proof
enough of the shortage. The crop
reports published in all the daily
papers of this country predict we
will have to import potatoes before
another crop i raised.
