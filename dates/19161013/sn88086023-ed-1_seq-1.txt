That the- coming of ttia Golden

(CARL ACKEjRMAN.)
DUSSELDORF. Oct. 13. Nearly
every big industrial leader In the
Rhine valley, Germany's Pittsburg,
favors ruthless submarining, disre
garding American Interests.
Hollweg faces the opposition ot
both the Rhine and Westphallan dis
tricts, th hotbeds of Ttrpltrtsm.
These interests hope to win HInden
burg to their side.
The Westfaellsche Zeitung said:
"The .war must be fought to a finish.
Germany or England must win. Th
Rhine Interests are ready to fight un
til Germany wins."
Germany's steel trust directors and
other Industrial millionaires declare
unreservedly that Germany won't
make peace until England asks her
terms. They contend they must us
every possible weapon against Eng
land. U-53 activities greatly Incraas
el their faith in the possibilities of
unlimited submarining.
August Thyssen. Germany's Car

operate submarines on American and
Canadian coasts to overcome Eng
land's eea advantages.
"This is uncomfortable for Ameri
ca, but it must be remembered we'r

nish the one means of ending the war.
We can't always war as America
wants. Germany never wants war
with America. We have enemies
enough. We are always friendly with
America, The world interests ot
both countries will develop through

Thyssen does not believe an eco
