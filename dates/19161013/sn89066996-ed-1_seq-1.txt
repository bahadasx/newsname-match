DONT BOTHER OUR PETS
Assessor Wells Criticised for Assessing
Foreigner Residents of Flat River
M Hammer
By Ed. Zolman
of The Times
We understand that a few Repub
lican Paul Prys are very busy again
this week manufacturing-dope against
Assessor Wells. They have concluded
i that Mr. Wells has been perniciously
I active in assessing about 1,200 or 1,
t 500 foreign miners. These miners all
! possess personal property all who
are heads of families having cows,
hogs, horses, etc., on which they have
never paid taxes. Why shouldn't they
pay personal taxes as well as the
American miner?
These Paul Prys who are so con
cerned about the foreigners being as
sessed, claim that they won't pay the
taxes and ask, then why assess them ?
How many Americans, they say, re
fuse to pay and get by with it. Mr.
Taxpayer, don't we maintain a Col
lector, whose fees make his the high
est salaried office in the county, to do
nothing but collect taxes? And the
law instructs him how to proceed in
the collection of taxes from persons
who refuse to pay. Should the As
sessor refrain from assessing them
just because they say they won't pay?
The Federal Lead Company wan
employing about 500 foreigners in
1915- as many or more than it em
ployed of American miners. It is a
well known fact that some of the
companies will hire a foreigner in
preference to an American, and yet
mcy (ion t want these foreigners to
pay taxes.
Tin- Doe Run Lead Company, it is
said, incorporated the town Rivermines
for no other purpose than to exempt
their foreign pets from paying a poll
or road tax.
Then, they declare that Wells is
not the man who raised the com
panies' assessments. Well, he has
never claimed that he did it all. but
he did the larger part of it, and as a
member of the Board of Equalization
concurred in the raises made by the
board.
That is one reason the companies'
agents are so anxious to defeat Mr.
Wells and replace him with Mr. Hen
son, a confidential clerk and paymas
ter, of one of the companies.
Mr. Taxpayer, do you see the-point?
PUBLIC SCHOOL NOTES
Wrong Date
In The Times' mention last week
of "An Innovation" to be established
by the Klein Grocer Co., in systema-.
tizing deliveries, we made an error as
to the date of starting this new sys
tem, which will be inaugurated on
November 6th. We stated that it
would be begun on the 6th of the
present month. The management
figured that it would be the better
plan to give a month's notice, in order
to better impress such change on the
public mind. When the proposed reg
ular deliveries shall have been inaug
urated there is little question that
the satisfaction with the improve
ment, win De general. ,
DEATH OF HENRY OBERBECK
Henry Oberbeck. one of our oldest
and highly respected citizens, died at
Farmington schools enjoyed an ex
cellent attendance for the first month.
The average for the entire school was
H6.71 per cent. This was slightly
above the first month last year. The
highest attendance was made by Mrs.
Gruner's room in the South ward.
The pupils were granted a half holi
day on last Friday in recognition of
their excellent attendance, which was
09.37 per cent.
Fire Prevention Day was duly ob
served in all the schools on Monday.
Instruction on the prevention of fires
was given in all departments and
muth interest was manifested in the
subject. Mr. Morsey represented the
city government and addressed the
pupils of the High School building
on the subject.

W. C. C. MEETING
The Woman's Civic Club held its
regular monthly meeting Thursday af
'ernoon in the Library. It was an in
teresting meeting, as several affairs
were settled.
A small sum of money was contri
buted to the fund for furnishing the
playgrounds of the public schools.
Two refuse cans were donated by a
member of the Club to be placed in
front of the Republican and Demo
cratic headquarters. Besides these
two, there are several others at dif
ferent places on the main streets. If
rhe citizens while in the business dis
trict will remember to wait until they
pass these places before throwing
away their waste paper or other re
fuse, they will aid greatly in the
Club's work to make Farmington the
cleanest and most sanitary city in the
State. Funds are not sufficient just
yet to allow the hiring of a street
rleaner. Therefore each person of the
town should feel responsible for the
appearance of the streets and do his
hare by being extra careful about
throwing things on the sidewalks or
in the gutters.
Another thing that was reported to
the Civic Club was that in building
very often large piles of waste ma
terial are left in the streets, for some
times a whole week. This not onlv ob
structs the traffic but also interfere"
with the drainage of the streets and
is unsightly. There is a city ordi
nance which makes it unlawful to
!eave anything piled in the public
Highway that would m the least in
terfere with the traffic. If we will
keep this ordinance in mind we will
not only avoid trouble, perhaps, but
will greatly improve the appearance
of our property.
The meeting hour of the Club has
been changed from 4 to 3 o'clock,
iuring the winter months. The Club
is planning for its active work in the
spring.
moved to Iron Mountain and then to
Farmington, where he had resided
over forty years. He married Miss
Elizabeth Helwig of this county, who
survives him, together with three
daughters: Mrs. F. W, Schramm of
Farmington, Mrs. H. E. Leverenz of
Hat River, and Miss Louise Oberbeck
of Farmington.
Mr. Oberbeck was a member of the
Lutheran Church and a man of up
right character, genial and sociabh
nature; a devoted husband and fa
ther to his family, and enjoyed the
respect and good will of all who knew
him. At a ripe age he laid down the
burdens of life to enter the rest eter
nal. His family have the sympathy
of many friends in their sorrowful
bereavement.
The funeral took place Monday,
services being conducted by Rev. H.
Hallerberg. pastor of the St. Paul's
Lutheran Church at Farmington, and
was largely attended.
One of the largest sales of regis
tered Hereford Cattle will take place
in Farmington on Saturday, October
28th, that has ever been pulled off in
this section of the State. Eighteen
young bulls and 2o cows and heifers
of the choicest blood line:; will be of
fered at public auction. These choice
cattle are the product of the St. Fran
cois County Hereford Breeders' Asso
ciation and may be depended on to be
of the purest strains. This breed of
cattle, commonly known as the "White
Face," is very popular among the
stock breeders of this section, and will
doubtless attract many enterprising
buyers from all parts of Southeast
Missouri.
The cattle to be offered are from
separate herds, being choice selec
tions from thi herds of eleven mem
bers of the St. Francois County Here
ford Bleeders' Association. Atten
tion is called to the half-page adver
tisement on the eighth page of The
Times. Look it over and then make
your arrangements to attend this big'
sale. JNow is a good time to buy and
another such opportunity so near
home will not be offered you this sea
son.
Ed Helber, one of Farmington's
uiwni, cAimisive niercnanis, spent Wed
nesday in securing mineral leases on
several hundred acres of land in the
Greasy Mines district, a short distance
south of Doe Run. This district was
at onje time considered a rich mineral
field, but of late years attention has
apparently been somewhat diverted
therefrom.
In this connection, we would sug
gest that it might he profitable for
those who may be affected with the
mining bee that it might prove as
profitable for them to invest in ven
tures nearer home possibly more so.
Judged from the renewed activity in
the Greasy Mines field, there must be
renewed inducements for profitable in
vestments there. At least an investi
gation of one's own home surround
ings would not necessarily be expen
sive. There is an old and true say
ing that "remote fields always appear
greenest."

SMALL FIRE
The building occupied by G. W.
Cunningham (property of Judge Jere
S. Gossom) on the street approach
ing the High School from the south,
was damaged by fire last Saturday
afternoon between four and five
o'clock. An unoccupied room in which
were stored some of the family cloth
ing caught fire in some mysterious
way. Prompt work of the fire depart
ment saved the building. About $25
damage was done the house, and the
family lost about $25 worth of cloth
ing. It is thought that perhaps a
mouse gnawing about the clothing
ignited a match that may have been
in some of the pockets.

M. A. Young and Russell Doss, who
have recently acquired apparently val
uable leases in the Miami, Okla., min
eral fields, have just received informa
tion that the first shaft on their hold
ings, now about 160 feet in depth, has
passed through 35 feet of good lead
and jack. Another and much thicker
ledge of mineral is expected at a
depth of about 200 feet.
The many friends of Messrs. Young
and Doss will be pleased to learn that
they have succeeded in getting into
the considerable bunch of Farming
tonians whose chances appear to be
good for a rich strike in the Miami
fields. May their dividends exceed
their most sanguine hopes, is the wish
of The Times.
Great Meetings
Benj. H. Marbury, of this city, de
livered speeches at several different
points in the county the past week,
and there was a large and enthusias
tic gathering of voters out to hear
him at each place. Thursday night
of last week he spoke, at Leadwood,
and judging from the interest and at
tention there manifested, it would
seem that the voters of that commun
ity are preparing to swing that here
tofore strong Republican stronghold
into tne Uemoeratic column.
At Bonne Terre Saturday night, and
at Desloge Monday night a marked
degree of interest and enthusiasm
was present. Mr. Marbury was great
ly pleased with the manner in which
his speeches were received at all these
points, and is confident, from mani
f ("stations everywhere apparent, that
St. Francois county will be reclaimed
to Democracy at the election next
month.
An Old Timer
ALLEN O'BANNOM
Albert O. Allen. Jr., and Mhs Ma. id
O'Bannon, both of New Madrid, were
married in St. Louis on Thursday,
October 5th, 1916. Mr. Allen is as
sociated with his father. Capt. Al
bert O. Allen, in the publication of
the New Madrid Record. We con
gratulate him on his election to the
Benedict Club, and wish for him and
his charming bride all the happiness
that their hearts anticipate.
Edward A. Rozier spoke to a fair-'i-d
audience .at the Court House
Monday evening. From a Republican
nolnt of view, the speech was fair,
though no new 001115! were made and
but little interest waa manifested.
Andrew McKinley of Commerce
Scott county, made The Times a pleas
ant call Wednesday afternoon. He is
79 years of age one of the old-timers.
This is his first visit to Farming-
ton since he passed through here in
1859 on his way from Cape Girardeau
to Pike's Peak on a wild-troose chase
for gold, and he says there is a big
oinerence between the beautiful Farm
ington of today and the little village
through which ie passed 58 years
ago. He knew the late Rev. Alvin
Rucker. "Rough and Ready" Watts,
the Coffmans and many others of
their day around here. Dr. Frazier
was coming over to attend a meeting
"f the Board of Managers of State
Hospital No. 4, and invited Mr. Mc
Kinley to come along with him in his
auto, and he availed himself of the
Opportunity to visit his niece, Mrs.
Drew Greer, of Wat River.
In this issue will be found a car
toon entitled "Railroadin' With a Tack
Hammer", which, in our humble judg
ment, is one of the very best picture
portrayals of the present political sit
uation that we have seen during the
present campaign. The Times is oar
ticularly proud of this picture for the
reason that it is the product of our
competent foreman, Edgar Zolman,
who has real genius as a cartoonist.
Every week he turns out several car
toons, just for the love of the work,
but it is only occasionally, when one
of them makes an unusually forceful
appeal, that we reproduce it in these
columns.
T:iis cartcon will bear 'he closest
inspection, and the longer you study
it the more you will find therein il
lustrative of the present Republican
situation. Note the minute hammer in
operation, and yet how smaller still
appears Charles "Eager" Hughes.
Note, too, the vast impression his
"binding influence" is having on "pub
lic opinion." The longer one looks at
this picture the smaller Charles
"Eager" grows. How very true to
life!
There is but one thing we can think
of that might improve the effect of
this cartoon, and that would be a com
posite picture, representing both
Hughes and Lamm, for if ever there
were two men who could be accurate
ly represented By the same dots and
lines, certainly it must be these two.
Both have occupied eminent positions
on the bench, and in some manner ac
quired the reputation of being "good"
judges, but the moment they got in
to the limelight as candidates for
high positions they go bug-house. If
either of them has said anything
worthy ot being repeated, since they
began jumping from stump to stump,
we would love to be cited. But all
this is no criticism of the cartoon.
Study it carefully and perhaps other
strong points in it will appeal to you.

have come to realize the many advan

mer residents, or having some business
or social interest in the county. Here

all over the State where he has been
lecturing in the interest of the State
Board of Agriculture and the College
of Agriculture at Columbia. Mo., for
a number of years. Mr. Wright's lec
ture will be found to be especially in
teresting to women and children,
farmers and business men, because it
is his purpose to set before the peo
ple of this State the beauties as well
as the wonderful possibilities of ag
riculture, horticulture, stock raising
and all other things of interest to a
Missouri citizen. The committee o
arrangements appointed by the St.

close at midnight Saturday, September
30th, at the Bonne Terre establish
ment. Much interest was created by
this contest, and thousand? of guess
es were sent in. This contest was put
on by Mr. Gillam simply as an adver
tisement for his different stores," and
in order to extend his personal ac
quaintance. It cost him hundreds of
dollars, and there was no chance for
the contest to bring him in a cent,
directly. Yet Mr. Gillam is well pleas
ed with the results of the contest. He
is a thorough business man, and knows
the value of good advertising.
The guessing contest was on the
time that a clock would stop in his
place in Bonne Terre, which had been
wound and locked, under the super
vision of a committee of twelve re
putable citizens and business men of
that place, who have been in charge
throughout, and who also awarded the
prizes for the nearest guess at which
the clock would stop, which was at
6:45:15 Tuesday evening, September

The first prize, a splendid maim.

For the Committee.
The Times has installed a splendid
new motor for its typesetting ma
chine, and we do not anticipate any
further trouble in that regard, at
least for some time to come.
For a Consideration
T. W. Hukriede. Chairman of the
State Republican Committee, is send
ing out a circular letter to all Repub
lican voters and sometimes the one
addressed proves to be a Democrats
calling loudly for campaign contri
butions. It says "There are two
things necessary to make Missouri a
Republican State; first, the money to
pay the necessary expenses, and sec
ond, the co-operation of every Repub
lican in the State." They'll certain
ly need all that and then some to
swing the old Ship of State Missouri
from her Democratic mooring. But
lis'en to the inducement he offers:
"We are going to mail everyone who
contributes to this worthy fund a
stock certificate which entitles him to
consideration on all party matters in
his State, district and county." Boys,
don't you see the pie sliced in libe
ral cuts ready to hand around? Hold
tight to those "stock certificates" or
you are sure to miss that slice of pie.
Herr Hukriede isn't as resourceful
as his Republican brother committee
man of Indiana. They are having a
guessing contest over there, with a
capital prize of $200 in gold or a free
trip to the presidential inauguration
for the best guesser. Any one twenty-
one years old and over may "sit in
the game," the only qualification be
ing that he register by a certain date
and pledge himself to vote for Hughes.
Neat, isn't it? Why not try the plan
here, Herr Hukriede. to swell the Re
publican vote in Missouri?
What's the score!
