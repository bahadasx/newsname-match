Parson Can't
Desert Race
Handed Him
Some folks are born to politics, oth­
ers asquire politics and still others
just naturally have it wished on them.
In the third category stands Rev.
Bruce E. Jackson, pastor of the First
Baptist church, whose name will go
on the official ballot in the 27th dis­
trict as a candidate for senator on
the Democratic tickdt. Very much
against his will, Mr. Jackson is pitted
against Carrol D. King of Menoken,
candidate for the senate on the Re­
publican ticket, and the Non-partisan
league's choice for the job.
Rev. Jackson was not a candidate
for the Democratic nomination last
Jome. In spite of that fact, he polled
14 votes, four more than received by
King on the Democratic ticket. This
made Jackson the nominee, and he
was so certified to the secretary of
state. The divine learned casually of
his preferment at the time, but gave
the matter little attention, intending
to resign. Then he forgot all about
it, and last Saturday at midnight
there passed the final hour for the
filing of withdrawals.
Yesterday the secretary of state
certified to the county auditor of Bur­
leigh the name of Rev. Bruce E.
Jackson as candidate for the senate.
Dr. Jackson was interviewed regard­
ing his candidacy last evening, and
he declared positively that he was not
a politician, not a candidate, and
would not make the race. The sec­
retary of state's office, however, re­
gards Mr. Jackson as a candidate, and
cannot quite see how the clergyman
is to pry his name from the official
ballot which will go to the voters
November 7.
Rev. Jackson will not run, but he
cannot avoid making the race—it has
been wished on him.
By Fairbanks
Billings, Mont., Oct. 12.—The need
of the Republican tariff policy to pro­
tect Montana's great and growing beet
sugar industry was pointed out by
Charles W. Fairbanks, Republican
candidate for vice president, in an ad­
dress here today.
Mr. Fairbanks declared that the el­
ection of Charles E. Hughes means
the protection of American rights
from every standpoint, both at home
and abroad.
He left Billings at 7:20 p. m. for
Bismarck, N. D.
I'LEANREIATHS

Petition of D. H. McArthur for
Removal of State Chairman
Denied.
ELECTION HELD TO HAVE
BEEN CONDUCTED LEGALLY
Fred McLean remains chairman of
the Democratic State Central commit­
tee. The petition of D. H. McArthur
for an ouster oh the grounds of irregu­
larities connected with his election by
the state central committe was denied
in a decision handed down by the su­
preme court at 5:30 last evening.
The opinion, written by Judge A. A.
Bruce, is one of the most volumin*
ous that has issued from the supreme
court in some time. It holds in brief
that the question of the committee's
method of naming a chairman is one
for political rather than judicial con­
sideration: that the majority of the
members of a political state central
committee has the inherent power to
deposit or elect a chairman at any
time, and that the supreme court will
not issue its high prerogative writs in
order to bring about that which vol­
untary political action can perform.
Section 890 of the compiled laws of
1913 is held not to make membership
in the state central committee prere­
quisite to its chairmanship.
Engerud, Holt and Frame of Fargo
represented McArthur, and Bangs,
Hamilton & Bangs of Grand Forks
the defendants.
Question of Proxies.
McArthur in bis petition which em­
braced Joseph M. Kelley. treasurer, as
well as McLean, set forth that at the
meeting of the Democratic State Cen­
tral committee in Bismarck on Sep­
tember 6 there were present 21 mem­
bers and twelve proxies, which prox­
ies were counted in order to consti­
tute a majority for McLean and Kelly,
neither of whom, he alleged, were
members of the state central commit­
tee. The question hinged entirely on
the right of proxies to vote as mem­
bers and the right of the members to
name officers from outside the com­
mittee.
Not Public Office.
In denying the writ the court held
that the state chairmanship is not a
public office: that the members of
the state committee assembled in due
form and that all members who so
desired were present that no protest
has been received from any member
of the committte, but from an outsider,
w'ho, though he may be deeply con­
cerned, had no voice or vote that if
•he results of the meeting were not
satisfactory to a majority, another
meeting could have been held, and the
mistake rectified: that the court
should not be called upon to do what
the majority of the committee still
have power to do.
Membership Unnecessary.
"We are satisfied," says the court,
"that membership in the central com­
mittee is not necessary to its chair­
manship the act of legislature
does not make it necessary." There
is cited the fact that it has been the
almost uniform ruling in the case of
private corporations that the presi­
dent, secretary and treasurer, even
the directors, may be chosen from
persons who are not even stockhold­
ers.
Proxies Generally Used.
"The use of proxies, in political
bodies, has throughout the history of
the state almost universally prevail­
ed, and was recognized by the legisla­
tures of 1890 and 1895 by regulating
but not prohibiting the same. We
must assume therefore that the right
still prevails," says the court.

SAFE IN PORT
Boston, Oct. 12.—The British steam­
er, Kingstonian, reported as among
those torpedoed by a German subma­
rine last Sunday, is safe in port, ac­
cording to word received today by
John K. Thomas, local manager of
the Ley land Line, which owns the
steamer. Mr. Thomas said that the
Kingstonian was thousands of miles
from Nantucket last Sunday.
HACK SAW—LIVE WIRE
DEAD MAN, FOR MINUTE
The combination of hack saw, 2,300
volts of electricity, and a live wire,
very nearly resulted in a dead man at
the sewer booster pump on Broad­
way yesterday, when a workman em­
ployed in the new sewer construction
attempted to sever an active wire.
The hack saw did its duty, as did the
live wire, and the workman took the
count. Only the fact that he wore
gloves forecludes the injunction to
omit flowers.

TO PROTEST OF
UHITEDJTATES
British and French Governments
Discuss Seizure of Mails in
Documents
TEXT IS NOT
MADE PUBLIC
Claim They Will Do All in Their
fower to Minimize lie-
lay
Washington, Oct. 11—Identical
memorandum from the 1,'ritish and
French governments replying to the
American protest against seizures of
neutral mails were delivered today to
the state department by the embas­
sies here. The text was not made
public, but the Allies are understood
to give renewed promises that every
effort will be made to minimize de­
lays and annoyance aused by exam­
ination, but to insist upon certain le­
gal rights in regard to mails which
the United States has denied.
The complaint of the American gov­
ernment has been based upon the
contention that many vessels have
been diverted from the high .seas in­
to British seaports in order to give
the British censors jurisdiction.
There is no indication that the new
memorandum makes :iy concession
of principles on that point.
The reply is made to the American
note of May 24, characterizing the
allied treatment of nv lis as a law­
less practice" and saying- that "only
a radical change in th present. Brit­
ish and French policy, restoring the
United States to its fi ll rights as a
neutral power will satis!y the govern­
ment,"..
The Allies claiavthat as the United
States admits the right of censorship
for purely war purposes, it c-annot
rightfully object to reasonable de­
lays inevitable to that censorship.
The new communication is the sec­
ond to come from the Allies in the
mail controversy, which began Janu­
ary 4.
It is expected that the text of the
allied communication will be made
later by the governments concerned.
The state department has been ad­
vised that the British reply to the
American blacklist protest will soon
be delivered here. There has been
no indication as to its contents.
TO PORT BY U. S. BOAT
New York, Oct. 12.—The British
steamship, City of Madras, was over­
hauled off Ambrose Channel lightship
tonight by the United States torpedo
boat destroyer, Sterrett, and brought
back to Clifton, Staten Island, after it
had ignored the war vessel's signal to
stop when it left quarrantine.

LUSITANIA DISASTER
Strike Riot
Continues at
Bayonne, N. J.
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 12.—One man
was killed and at least a score wound­
ed, two so seriously they are not ex­
pected to live, in a pitched battle here
late today between striking employes
of the Standard Oil company and the
police. The fight was the culmination
of a series of disturbances that be­
gan Wednesday and continued
throughout last night and today. New
Jersey militiamen back from the Mex­
ican border, who were sworn in as
special policemen, aided in dispersing
the rioters, who were terrorizing the
city by looting and burning.
Half a dozen sheds overlooking the
oil refineries were set on fire before
the authorities were able to restore
a semblance of order by firing volleys
of rifle and pistol shots into the ranks
of the strikers and their sympathiz­
ers.
Isador Natilsky, 22 years old, a law­
yer, who had no part in the rioting,
late today, was killed. He was shot
through the back, it was said, while
running from the scene of battle.
Harris Martin, ID years old, a by­
stander, was shot through the right
lung and will probably die, according
to physicians. Edward Green, 30
years old, was shot through the left,
lung. He probably will die.

Officials Relieved at Conclusion

GOVERNMENT'S POLICY
STILL UNDETERMINED
Washington, Oct. 12.—Investigation
of Germany's submarine operations
off Nantucket apparently has eased
the minds of officials here, but it was
said authoritatively here tonight that
should the situation develop prolong­
ed paralysis of American trade in the
Atlantic or any similar injury vital
to American interest abroad, issue
might be raised transcending the spe­
cific question of international law dis­
cussed in connection with the U-boat
raid.
Such considerations as the disloca­
tion of shipping along the Atlantic
seaboard, the great increase in marine
insurance rates, and the possibility of
serious freight conjestion and railroad
embargoes have been foremost in the
minds of ofi.cials, it was indicated,
and will determine largely the govern­
ment's policy if an extensive submar­
ine campaign is attempted on this
side of the Atlantic.
Hughes Says He Would Not
Tolerate Friendly Relations
After Disaster
CALLS ATTENTION TO
PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Terms Wilson's Advocacy of
"New Freedom" in Reality
"The New Slavery"
Louisville, Ky.P Oct. 12.—Charles E.
Hughes, answering a question here to­
night as to what he would have don®
when the Lusitania was sunk, declar­
ed he would have "made it known in
terms unequivocal and unmistakable
that we should not tolerate a contin­
uance of friendly relations," when no­
tice was published "with reference to
the threatened action."
Charles E. Hughes went through the
mountains of Kentucky today, a new
campaign field for presidential nomi­
nees, outlining his views on the main­
tenance of American rights and ended
his day's tour of the state with a
meeting here tonight, in which he de­
clared that the "new freedom" advo­
cated by President Wilson four years
ago had been transmuted in one re­
spect to "the new slavery."
The Protective Tariff.
In his speech in Phoenix Hill hall
here tonight, Mr. Hughes devoted
much of his attention to the protect­
ive tariff and to what he termed "the
new slavery."
"We have heard much of the new
freedom," he said. "It seems to have
a surprising and deplorable range. It
has meant freedom to sacrifice the
principle of the merit system, which
our opponent^ pledged themselves tp
support, it has meant freedom to Em­
bark the government in novel enter­
prises in competition with "foiivate
business, as in the case of the gov­
ernment shipping bill.
"It has meant freedom to depart
from the principles of international
law to conduct a personal diplomacy
to satisfy personal vindictiveness. It
has meant freedom to wage war, not
to protect American rights, but to
dislodge a disliked ruler and to leave
our citizens and their property to an­
archy and revolution. It has meant
freedom to depart from our timehon
ored policy of protecting American
citizens who take American enter­
prise abroad, and to substitute a new
policy, which treats them as adven­
turers, whose flag is no longer a sym­
bol of protection of their just rights.
"It means freedom to subvert the
principles of government by yielding
authority to the demands of force.
In this last phase, instead of the new
freedom, we have the new slavery.
What are the characteristics of this
new slavery? It is the use of the
form of free institutions to tyrranize
over the public, to impose demands
without inquiry as to their justice.
Government by Hold-up.
"The new slavery is government by
holdup. It is terrorized government,
or the rule of politics assuming ter­
ror as an excuse for submission. The
executive is chosen to defend the cit­
adel of constitutional government.
Instead, he surrenders it. Where
shall this stop?
Serious Blows to Business.
"These innovations are serious
blows to American business. Put it
is said that the administration hns
aided business and, strangely enough,
it refers to the anti-trustact.
"Yet, the administration complac­
ently speaks of aiding business by
defining the evils aimed at by the
anti-trust act.
"Not only does the federal trade
commission act. not define what it
means by unfair competition, but it
leaves the anti-trust act in full effect
as before."
RUBY FOUND NOT GUILTY
OF ATTEMPT TO SUICIDE
The Nick Ruby suicide incident was
closed in Police Magistrate Dolan's
court, when Mr. ,Ruby was acquitted
of a charge of attempted self-murder.
Mr. Ruby, who was recently found
sane by an insanity inquest, yester­
day accompanied States Attorney
Berndt and Judge Dolan to his home
and re-enacted "the tragedy," proving
that a man may bang about the house
without suicidal intent. Ruby show­
ed the officers of the law how he af­
fixed the noose in such a manner that
it could not do much damage, depos­
ited a butcher knife within conveni­
ent reach of prospective rescuers and,
with the stage all set, dispatched a
neighbor to invite his wife to the
hanging.

London, Oct. 12.—Another step for*

been made by the Italians in tbe re­
gion south of Gorizia, additional
points of vantage hav ing been cap
tured and 1,771 men made prisoners.
In this region, which is about 18
miles northwest of Trieste, in the
Julian Alps to the east, the Italians
from August 6 to the present, report
that they have captured 30,881 Austri
ans.
Russians 8till in Retreat.
Along the entire eastern Tranayl
vanian front the Russians are still in
retreat, and also in the north are be­
ginning to fall back before the troops
of the Teutonic Allies, according to
Berlin.
Town of Seres Threatened.
The British troops have reacheA
the outskirts of the important town
of Seres, in Greek Macedonia, north
of Lake Tahinos, having driven In
their opponents from the outlying dis­
tricts. London reports that the town
is strongly held by the Teutons.
Westward, the village of Brod, which
lies in Serbia, southeast of iMonastir,
has been captured by tbe Serbians.
That the British havsgained some
additional ground riorth of Thlepval,
south of the Ancre river in France,
and on the Sars-Gueudecourt line, is
indicated in the Berlin official com­
munication, which says British at*
tacks here failed "for the most part,"
before the German curtain of fire.
West of Sailly-Saillisel, the French
have made a further advance.
League Keeps
Hands Off in
National Row
"The Non-partisata league absolutely,
has no favorites in the national and
county races," declared F. B. Wood of
Fargo, manager of the Equity Live­
stock exchange in the Twin Cities,
and one of the "Big Five" in Non­
partisan circles.
Mr. Wood gladly consented to be
interviewed upon the subject. Me de­
nied positively that the league is tak­
ing any part in the presidential, sen­
atorial or county fights. He was as
certain that the league is not mixing
in county scraps.
Not For Any One Man.
"Neither the league nor any of its
officers has declared openly or pri­
vately for Wilson or for Hughes, for
McCumber or for Burke, or for any
other candidate than those endorsed
on the state and legislative tickets.
I know it has been reported that
there is a quiet movement under way
in behalf of national candidates. It
is absolutely untrue so far as the
league as an organization is concern­
ed. We have been careful as individ­
ual officers to express no preference,
for fear it might be misinterpreted.
We have friends on both sides, and
we are keeping out."
Will Elect Every Man.
"The Xon-partisan league will elect
every man it has endorsed," contin­
ued Mr. Wood. "Does that include
Casey?" Mr. Wood was asked. "Yott
bet it does," he replied. 'P. M. Casey
of Lisbon, candidate for state treas­
urer, is the only state candidate on
the Democratic ticket backed by tha
league. Mr. Wood declares he has
met at the Twin Cities representa­
tives from every county in the-state,
and that victory for the Non-partisan
league is assured.
