FOR EXTRAVAGANCE
food Crowd Attends Meeting County
Attorney Torrance is Presiding
Officer.
Characterizing the Woodrow Wil
son administration as the "most in
consistent administration ever known
in the history of the world" and de
claring that the only solution for
the bettering of present conditions
was a Republican administration,
Congressman Halvor Steenerson of
Crookston opened the Republican
campaign in Bemidji last night at
the city hall
He flayed the Democratic party for
having failed to redeem its important
promises and pointed out that while
the Democrats were boasting of laws
they have passed, they had little to
say about the administration.
Little Administration.
"The Democratic campaign speech
es devote much space to legislation
and very little to administration,"
jaid Congressman Steenerson. "Presi
dent Wilson overlooks the fact that
the chief promises made by the party
were to reduce the cost of living
and to practice economy on public
affairs, and both of these promises
have been broken
Congressman Steenerson severely
scored the president for his failure in
office He said, "The trouble With
the president and his supporters is
that they have misconceived the
functions of the presidency. In
stead of showing that he is a great
executive and administrator they are
trying to prove he is a great law
giver. What the country needs is
efficiency in the administration of the
laws."
Band Gives Concert.
The meeting last night was called
shortly after eight o'clock and the
hall was filled with enthusiastic Re
publicans who applauded mention of
Hughes, Fairbanks, Kellog and Har*
.14 Knutson'a names The Bemidji
band gave a good program of music
before the meeting.
County Attorney Graham Tor
rance, chairman of the Beltrami
county committee, presided at the
leeting. He, with Congressman
/Steenerson and S. Ervin, Beltrami
county representative of the state
central committee, were seated upon
the stage which was decorated with
the American flag and pictures of
Hughes and Burnquist
A True Minnesotan.
Chairman Torrance introduced
Congressman Steenerson as a "true
Minnesotan" and he told of Mr
Steenerson's coming to Minnesota
where he earned an enviable reputa
tion as a lawyer and statesman Con
gressman Steenerson has been a
resident of Northern Minnesota for
the past 35 years
Congressman Steenerson opened his
address by telling of his experiences
when he represented this district. He
told of how he had aided in securing
the appropriation for the Bemidji
postoffice but how the Democrats
had failed to order the building con
structed
He praised Hughes and Fairbanks,
Kellogg for United States senator and
Harold Knutson as congressman from
this district He urged the voters
to have a care and vote for Harold
^JCnutson and not John Knutson, the
prohibition candidate, at the gen-
,1 election.
Best Fitted.
"Charles B. Hughes is an eminent
1ud#e, a ereat administrator and sn
Ideal citizen," said Congressman
^rtt net Mm "He is an ideal man for
the position of president of the Unit
ed States and by all odds he is the
best equipped man
Four issues which Congressman
Steenerson spoke on were the high
cost of living," "trust laws," "extra
vagance" and the reform in rules of
the house and senate He pointed
out that the "Democrats as econo
mists are failures," that the Demo
crats passed the most tyrannical
rules ever known in the house or sen
ate by adopting the caucus system,
that the Democrats pulled the teeth
out of the trust laws and that the
Democrats had blundered in foreign
affairs
He bitterly scored the Democratic
statement that "President Wilson had
kept us out of war" and explained
how President Wilson had really had
the country in two wars
He bitterly flayed President Wil
son for "declaring war" himself
without the consent of congress and
in conclusion urged that the ques
tion of peace or war should be left
-Jn the hands of those who represent
.rthe people and not in the hands of
one man.
Farts of Address.
Congressman Steenerson's address
in part follows:
"I have represented Beltrami coun
ty and this district in the state sen
ate and in the house of representa
tives since 1882 and I remember the
many friends in Beltrami county and
an Bemidji, that helped me during
8
7'
A.
ZJLW
my first campaign when receiving a
plurality of 700 in this county I
was elected by 400.
"I am surprised at the many evi
dences of prosperity in Bemidji and
congratulate you upon the future
that lies before you. I understand
that the United States government
has purchased a site for a public
building, which appropriation I se
cured for you last term. The build
ing has not been erected, but I hope
soon that we will have an adminis
tration that will do things. All that
remains to be done is for the execu
tive department to do its part.
"I am here on this occasion to
speak for the Republican party, to
present to you the political issues
from the Republican point of view.
A Reunited Party.
"The Republican party this year
comes before the people a reunited
party. The present nominee is a
great administrator, an eminent
judge and an ideal American citizen.
"We have also nominated for vice
president another American states
man, Charles W Fairbanks of In
diana.
"We have also up for United States
senator, Frank Kellogg of St Paul,
the man Attorney General Knox, dur
ing Roosevelt's administration select
ed for his assistant in the prosecu
tion of the Standard Oil trust. The
trust was dissolved.
"For Republican representative
from this district we, with great de
liberation and consideration, have se
lected that bright and noble public
spirited young man, Mr. Harold
Knutson of St. Cloud.
"Mr. Hughes came into prominence
in New York first as a lawyer. When
the people of New York were in the
grip of the gas trust and appealed to
the legislature, they decided upon an
investigation and a committee was
appointed to look into the matter to
see if this reduction could be made.
Mr Hughes as counsel, conducted an
investigation for many months and
after a full analysis of the situation
the cost of gas was fixed at 80 cents.
Insurance Reform.
"Several years afterwards life in
surance companies in New York be
came a matter of public concern. The
life insurance companies controlled
large amounts of cash and funds of
many business concerns of the world.
It amounted to millions of dollars,
and was deposited in various banks,
money invested by policy holders, and
was a matter of great concern to the
people of the United States The
danger was that life insurance would
be ruinel. Commissioner Armstrong
employed Mr. Hughes to investigate.
Facts were brought out and reports
were made recommending a reform.
As a result, life insurance laws in
New York were revised This 4nsur
ancerreform was due largely to the
efforts of Mr. Hughes.
"As a reward for his work he was
nominated mayor of New York City.
He refused. Later on he was nomin
ated for governor of New York. He
accepted and was elected." As* gov
ernor of Now York he came into
prominence by the corrupt practice
law and the workmen's compensation
act, of which he was iho author. La
ter he was named for the supreme
court bench. While on the supreme
bench, he wrote the opinion of the
Minnesota rate case, which involved
the rights of the state of Minnesota
to regulate her own freight rates and
fix a 2-cent passenger rate."
In speaking of the issues of the
present campaign Congressman
Steenerson said:
"What are the things that the
Democrats promised you four years
ago, when you put them in power?
"One thing was that they would
reduce the high cost of living Next
they said that they would reform
the anti-trust law and prove mon
opoly was indefensible Any trust,
they said, that could restrain trade
was guilty of a crime Monopoly
was intolerable and that they must
make laws so that a man who was
guilty of monopoly be sent to jail
The next thing they hollered about
was the Republican extravagance It
was enough to drive tears to the eyes
of anybody They said that they
would reform the rules of the house
and senate
Foreet War.
"The Democrats say that the pres
ent prosperity is due to Democratic
legislation They have forgotten all
about the war The present prosper
ity is almost absolutely due to the
war The war has shut off all im
ports from abroad Our people now
supply that demand themselves Our
exports have more than doubled We
have exported three billion dollars
worth of goods last year More than
a billion dollar increase
"Is this a safe prosperity for us?
When the war is over thousands of
men will be turned into producers in
stead of consumers Not only that,
but in many of the warring countries
they are now manufacturing articles
to be turned into gold after the war
is over order to recuperate and to
pay back some pf the money that they
borrowed Where then will be our
market7
"Did the Democrats practice econ
omy' No Figures show that the
Democrats have appropriated $156,-
000,000 more than the Republicans
the last year they were in power
"Then they created so many worth
less offices They created 14,000
new offices, among them being the
farm loan board, which costs ?1,000
a day Then there is the trade com
mission of five members, each he
ceivmg $10,000 a year, and every one
of them a Demc "'atic 'taxeater'
"Then they propriated $1,000,-
000 to drum up -ade
"What becon of their promise
to reduce the number of offices?
"What about the trusts that they
were going to destroy entirely? The
president sent a message to congress
stating that the trust laws should
be changed and clarified. The law
was not directed against* big busi
ness, but against evil business. Did

Pitched Battle Occurs Between the

(By United Press)
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 13.Although
fearing that Friday the thirteenth
might prove to be a bloody Friday,
police and citizens are attempting to
quell the Standard Oil workers strike
which has probably resulted in two
deaths, without calling out the mili
tia. With one additional death re
ported this morning, it is uncertain
if this is possible, strikers are in a
fighting mood. Police and special
deputies are ready for anything.
On account of the closing of sa
loons the police, it is believed, will
have a better chance to quell the
strike.
Man Found Dead.
An unidentified man was found
dead near a saloon this morning.
One man was killed and at least a
score wounded, two so seriously that
they are not expected to live, in a
pitched battle here last night between
striking employes of the standard Oil
company and the police. The fight
was the culmination of a series of dis
turbances that began Wednesday.
New Jersey militiamen back from the
border, who were sworn in as special
policemen, aided in dispersing the
rioters, who were terrorizing the city
by looting and burning.
Sheds on Fire.
Half a dozen sheds overlooking the
oil refineries were set on fire before
the authorities were able to restore a
semblance of order by firing volleys
ojf rifle and pistol shots into the
ranks of the strikers and their sym
pathizers.
Isador Natilsky, 22 years old, a law
yer, who had no part in the rioting,
late yesterday was killed. He wa?
shot through the back, it was said,
while running from, the- sosae of the
battle.
The street approaching the Con
stable Hook section of this-cjity re
sembled today an armed camp. Thou
sands of strikers from/the plants of
the Standard Oil company, Tidewater
Oil company, Vacuum Oil company,
Pacific Coast Borax company and the
Central Chemical company maintain
ed a "dead line" across the approach
es to these plants. Nearly 100 po
licemen were stationed in a fire en

attack, while a few other policemen
and 75 deputy sheriffs held posses
sion of the main police headquarters.
