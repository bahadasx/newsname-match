piston of the American national sport
witnessed the victor)'. 42.626 fans de

As a result of the four-Kumes-to
(At eontesi over Brooklyn, Hoston is
UHitgbt celebrating Ita fifth victory n
world s serlea since i u o 3 , and there Is
added Joy In the faoi that never In
its history has B Hoston team been
forced i" bow to the superior prow
ess of rival In such a contest.
The victory over Brooklyn today
was so (lean-cut and decisive that
there "as left no ground for argu
ment. Thai the better team won the
DMstpionahip .was obvious. Before
the speed and curves of Ernest Shore,
the BrooRlyns were well-nigh ! elp
less, while Jeff Pfeffer, the last hope
of Brooklyn, proved unequal tj tho
task of holding Hoston in check.

The invaders from Creator New

it whs the result of a pass, a sacri
fice, and an out and a paaaad ball.
Koston, on the Other hand, got ten
basse on seven hits and two of its
four runs were earned.
i nns in Overcoats,
Although the contest was playd
before a record throng of fans, there
as only s moderate amount of en
thWRasm, the chilling weather and the
ease with which Boston disposed of its
opponents dulling the edge of such
outbursts as sprang from grandstands
and bleachers at the more thrilling
points "f thfl game. The day was hit
tor cold, with a piercing wind from
the easl. The spectators, who paid
IM.vT:: to witness the triumph of the
American league champions, came
prepared for the November-like
weather, Overcoats, fur wraps and
heavy glovel were much in evidence.
Aside from Shore's clever cold
weather hurling and a sensational
running shoe-top euteh by Wheat off
Shore In tlie fifth, and Ita male by
la win fn the eighth, when he robbed
Mcrkle, hatting for Pfeffer. of an
apparently sure double, the game was
devoid of feature plays.

I In the same park October U, a year
'ago. when the amounts were a few

surpassed the banner records made In
1911, and 1912, bat the amount di
vided among the players establishes
a new standard for money won by the
contestants.
The attendance for tho five games
this year amounted to 162,;i"!l, and
the receipts, tSS6.580.60. f this sum, I
the players received $112, 9:17.45; each I
club M,062.0I, and the national
COmmuntiop I3I.S59.05. The Boston
I club, as winners, divided 195,756.47 on j
basis of twenty-five shares, which
the players are understood to have
agreed upon ns the method of appor

j 2fi a share. The twentv-threc Brook

Owing to the fact that there are more

Hughes went through the mountains
of Kentucky today, a BOW campaign
field for presidential nominees, out
lining Ids views on the malnlenanee of
American rights and ended his day's
tour of the state with a meeting here
tonight, In whb b lie declared that tho
"new freedom" advocated by Presi
dent Wilson four years ago had been
transmuted. In one respect, to tho
"new slavery."
Mr. Hughes spoke In six towns to
day lo audiences that had come, for
the most part, for miles to hear him.
They came down from the mountains,
men and women, on foot, on horse
back, and on mulebaek. Home of the
mounts had saddles, some had none,

In his speech In Phoenix Hill hall

much of his attention lo Hie protec

"We have heard much of the new
