VOL. XLVI
LEXINGTON, LAFAYETTE COUNTY, MISSOURI, FRIDAY, OCTOBER, 13, 1916.
NUMI.ER 11.
BLUES 7; ATHLETICS 0.
Home Boys Made a Very Credit
able showing in Fast Com
pany. The game Thursday between
the Kansas City team of the
American Association and the
Lexington Athletics was thor
oughly enjoyed by a large crowd.
Without going into details, it
will be sufficient to state that
the "Blues" had the class and of
course won; but the game was
interesting nevertheless. The
home boys played a very credit
able game. They made a few
errors and in a few instances
were not awake to the possibili
ties of their positions. McCabe,
of the St. Louis Browns, was in
the box for the locals and deliv
ered the goods in fine shape.
Capt. Wykoff handled cleanly
everything he put over. Mc
Cabe, in fielding his position
used more speed than the home
boys were accustomed to and
this, in a few instances, result
ed in the runner being safe in
stead of out. He, however, soon
adjusted himself to conditions,
burned them over to the batters
and a very interesting contest
was the result.
Smith, for the Blues, had too
much smoke for the home boys
Capt. Gates made a double and
Stevens a single that was all.
Batteries Smith and Har
grave ; Athletics, McCabe and
Wykoff.
Two Young Boys Apprehended.
Arthur and Luther Jackson,
ages 13 and 15 years, were
taken from a train Sunday at
Myrick and turned over to Sher
iff Waddell. The two boys left
their home in Damascus, Ohio,
about two weeks ago with 64
cents between them and arrived
here with 4 cents. The boys say
that their parents have separat
ed and that their father is fore
man of a steel works in Damas
cus, and that their mother is
living somewhere in California
with two small sisters. The
father is a Saturday night
drunkard and when in this con
dition beats up everyone in
sight. At one of these orgies
he was so brutal to the two boys
that they decided to make their
way to their mother. Sheriff
Waddell is trying to locate the
mother. In the meantime he has
taken them into his home, given
them clean clothing, and will
give them home comforts until
their relatives can be located.
The boys are exceedingly bright
little fellows, well mannered and
appreciative of every attention
If the mother can be located, we
would suggest that enough mon
ey be raised in the community
to send the little fellows on their
way in comfort.
Engagement Announced.
A very beatifuHy appointed
five course luncheon party was
given Thursday by Mrs. C. T.
Ryland at her home on East
Main street. Covers were laid
for twelve guests, and Miss
Annie Wood Eggleston was
given the seat of honor. The
luncheon was to announce her
approaching marriage to Mr.
Layton Barnett.
The happiness of the occasion
was given special emphasis in
the manner of the anonunce
ment, typified in the bluebird
perched on the edge of water
goblets. Each carried a tiny
note with the names of Mr.
Barnett and Miss Eggleston and
the date of Nov., 15th, 191G.
The social prominence of both
young people make the wedding
one of unusual interest to both
town and county friends.

the home Monday afternoon at 2
o'clock.
Athletics 13; All-Pros 3.
The baseball game Sunday
between the Athletics and the
All-Pros (Butter Fingers) .re
suited in a very close contest as
far as the pitching went. "Hein
ie" Huber was in the box for B.
F.'s and allowed only four hits.
But, the ball was too elusive for
his fielders, and the score went
against him to the tune of 13 to
3. The game was well patronized
which was the all important
thing as the proceeds were divid
ed between the players. For
this the players are very thank
ful.
The Meanest Man in Lexington.
Rev. Trigg A. M. Thomas who
has been preaching on the street
at 10th and Main and in the
Presbyterian church during the
past three weeks will preach to
a great mass meeting for men
and boys only in the Presbyter
ian church next Sunday at 3 p.
m. Thomas says that he has
found out just who the meanest
man is and if any man or boy
doubts his nerve or ability to
tell it, just call around at the
church and be convinced. Every
man and boy in and around Lex
ington most cordially invited.
' Mr. Thomas will preach on
the street at 10th and Main each

others to church services.

Some 30 decisions have already
been recorded for Christ and
the church. And many have re
solved to live a better and more

In Memory of George Joseph
Small.
On Tuesday, evening, October
3rd, 1916, George, the 6 year oM
son of Robt. Small and wile,
slipped away to him who said:
"Suffer little children to come
unto me." All unspotted from
this world in which he tarried
such a little while such a little
while! Only just long enough
for the parent's heart strings to
entwine about the little life so
near their own, and to make
them feel the loss through all
the years to come. For each day
brings a new sense of loss; the
oss of what the child would be
then. As only those of us who
have seen the little white cask
ets carritd from our homes
know.
In the cold moist earth we
laid him,
When the forest cast the leaf,
And we wept that one so love
ly,
Should have a life so brief.
And yet not we meet it, was
that, this fair child of ours.
So gentle and so beautiful,
should perish with the flowers.
