APPEALS TO HIS ALLIES
King Ferdinand of Rumania in an
interview with a London Times, cor
respondent appealed to the Allies not
to permit Rumania to suffer the fate
of Serbia and Belgium. The Ruman
ian decision to enter the war, stated
the king, was based on the highest
principles of nationality. The need of
reasonable assurance of protection for
her hundreds of miles of almost un

into the war, he said.

(Associated Press)
Washington, Oct. 13. Admiral
Mayo, commanding the Atlantic fleet,
has notified the navy department that
he has ordered a 'survey of the New
England coast to investigate reports
that belligerent ships had established
a base tnere or that wireless plants
were being operated in violation of
American neutrality. . "
ALL REPORTS .TAKEN
WITH
SALT
Announcing Admiral Mayo's action,
Secretary Daniels said that several
destroyers had already been dispatch
ed from Newport north. Naval offi
cials placed little credence in the re
ports. ,
OUR DESTROYER PATROL
Newport, Oct. 13. A patrol of U.
S. destroyers to enforce neutrality
and save lives in the event of further
submarine raids on shipping has
been established from Bar Harbor,
Me., to New York. Official authority
for this statement was obtained here
this morning. Eleven destroyers are
patrolling the waters of the Atlantic
coast tli A.j.JrJ .v...-.-. ..; ,r-
ENTIRE COAST MAY BE INCLUD-
v ED :';:-L ".;
Boston, Oct. 13. It was stated here
that American destroyers have been
ordered to patrol the coast from. New
York to Galveston. This report was
not officially confirmed.
SAW A SUB V
Boston, Oct. 13 The British 'steam
er Bovic, in a wireless received here
this morning, reported sighting a sub
marine of unidentified nationality 200
miles east of New York. The sub
marine's course was not stated. .
The steamer's report said the sub
marine was "astern," but whether
pursuing the Bovic or keeping an in
dependent course was not stated.
CRUISERS OFF THE COAST
Boston, Oct. 13. There is a fleet of
foreign cruisers and destroyers off
the American coast, according to Cap
tain Linderou3 of the Russian steam
er Hesperus, which arrived from
Huelva, Spain, this morning. ; Capt.
Linderous told his pilot the warships
passed him off Cape Sable Wednes
day, heading southwest. Many water
front authorities believed British de
stroyers were sent to convoy mer
chantmen.
SUBMARINE TROUBLE
Washington, Oct. 3. Although an
investigation of the recent submarine
activities has apparently eased the
minds of officials here, it is said
authoritatively that should the situa
tion develop a prolonged paralysis of
American trade, a broad issue might
be raised transcending specific ques
tions of international law m connec
tion with the submarine raids. Dis
location of shipping along the Atlan
tic seaboard increases in marine in
surance rates: and possibly serious
freight congestion are things which
may largely determine the ; govern
ment's policy.
The sinking - of the Dutch steamer
Bloomersdyke, bound from one neu
tral port to another, is being consider
ed. What measures Germany is con
templating against neutral trade from
American ports is a matter of much
speculation. -
KINGSTONIAN IS SAFE
Boston, Oct. 13 The British steam
er Kingstonian, which, was reported
as beine among those sunk by, the
German submarine off Nantucket last
Sunday, is safely in port, according
to a message received by the Leland
Steamship line, owners of the vessel.
The massage stated that the Kings
tonian was a thousand miles from
Nantucket Sunday. y

WILL WE BE DRAWN INTO THE
- WAR?
Is this country about to be drawn
into the world war ! Special dispatches
to the Philadelphia Ledger and the
New York World, both of which the
New York Times has seen fit to re
print on its front page, jsay that Am
bassador Gerard has come to this
country to inform President Wilson
that Germany is about to renew sub
marine warfare without regard for
international law.
William C. Bullitt, correspondent of
the Public Ledger, in a wireless to his
paper, says:
"Ambassador 4 Gerard " positively
brings ho peace proposals from the
kaiser to President Wilson; he has re-'
turned to the United States to dis
cuss with the president the steps, dip
lomatic and military, which should be
taken by the United States to prevent
Germany from beginning again to
sink merchantmen without warning."
According to the correspondent of
the World Mr. Gerard "comes to de
scribe the heavy black cloud hansrinsr
over German-American relations in
the form of the submarine menace,
which is growing day by day, and
which even the most friendly German
statesmen agree will break open after
election, unless the unexpected occurs
and peace intervenes."
