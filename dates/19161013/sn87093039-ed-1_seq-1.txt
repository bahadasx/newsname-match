aE ELUM GOOD ROADS
PARTY HERE WEDNESDAY
On Way Home From Eastern Washing
ton Good Roads Meeting at We
natchee first of the Week
On their way home from Wenatchee,
where they attended the eastern Wash
ington good roads meeting Tuesday,
the following Cle Elum, Kittitas coun
ty, men stopped here Wednesday:
Dr. D. O. Kirby, republican candidate
for the legislature from Kittitas county;
Mr. M. C. Ballard, county commis
sioner from the western part of the
county; Mr. M. P. Kay, the biggest
good roads booster and good citizen
in Kittitas county, and last, but only
least in stature. Mr. H. B. Averill,
editor of the Cle Elum Echo and Ros
lyn Miner. They visited The Echo
and were more or less interested in
everything in and about Leavenworth.
At Wenatchee they met good roads
people from almost every county in
eastern Washington, and discussed
what in the way of road improvement
was necessary in the eastern part of the
state. The conference discussed the
proposed road down the Columbia
river from Wenatchee to connect with
the Vantage ferry read and other road
connections. The building of another
highway across the state was not seri
ously taken up, it appearing that for
the present, taxes being already burden
some, it was not advisable to under
take another expensive highway. The
only thing that remained at this time
is to connect up with local roads and
the big highways.
After taking in the town and visiting
with old acquaintances the party left
for home at 1 o'clock, with much
praise for the condition of our roads
and the improvement made and being
made on the Chelan county side of the
Blewett pass.
Wenatehee School Children Are
Picking Apples
The Wenatchee World of Tuesday
contained the following:
The city schools including the 7th,
Bth and high school grades, will be
dismissed tonight until Thursday,
October 26. This action was taken by
the school board this morning on the
representation on the part of the par
ents that the young people are needed
to assist in orchard work.
The orchard labor shortage this fall
has become very acute and there has
been a strong demand on the part of
the parents that the school board dis
miss school for two weeks. Yesterday
blanks were distributed in the upper
grades, directed to the parents, ask
ing whether or not the help of the
young people was required. When
the poll was counted, rt was lound that
9 parents out of 10 desired the closing
of the school«. The vacation period
will extend this week and next and the
law requires the schools to close three
days during institute week, which has
been fixed as the first three days of the
week of October 23. School duties
will be resumed again on the 26.
The school board was very reluctant
to order the closing of the schools but
owing to the insistence of the parents,
it was deemed the wisest course.
Efforts will be made during the re
mainder of the school year to cut the
vacations a little short so as to make
up a few days at least of the lost time.
first Number of Lyceum Club Entertain
ment
The Miurer Sister*, who appeared
here last season and will be reraem

entertainment furnished, will again be

bers to be given in the Scenic theatre
this winter. Season tickets are now on
sale by the members of the Kumtux

Community Concert at the High
School Building
The first of a series of concerts to be
given in the High school auditorium
came off as announced last week and
proved to be a good drawing eutertain
ment. Every seat in the large room
was occupied and a number were unable
to obtain seats and had to be provided
with temporary accommodations.
The different numbers on the pro
gram were well received and invariably
brot an encore. The concert was
given under the direction of Mrs. Cartel
teacher of music in the High school
department of our school. These con
certs, it is understood, are to be given
once a month during the winter.
PLACER MINE NEAR

River—Deed Names $70,000 as
Selling Price
The following story, printed in the
Wenatchee World ol Wednesday, will
be read with interest by the mining
men because it comes near home, and
illustrates how we sometimes have to
go away from home to get the news:
Two placer claims, Baxter and Brad
ner, located near Sugar Loaf mountain
in the Leavenworth Mining district
have been sold by Robert Wilson of
Tacoma to the Central Products com

Corkery is Making a Strenuous
Campaign
Tom Corkery, republican candidate
for congress in the fifth district, opened
the third week of his campaign with a
stirring speech at the armory in Spo
kane Monday night, where he faced an
audience of 5,000 men and women.
It was the candidate's first appear
ance before a political mass meeting in
Spokane since his nomination on Sept.
12, and the applause which greeted
him was fully equal to the ovation
given Charles Warren Fairbanks, can
didate for vice-president, and Governor
Henry Mcßride, who were presented
from the same platform.
In two weeks of campaigning the
candidate for congress has traveled 700
miles by train and automobile, touch
ing most of the high spots in Chelan,
Okanogan, Ferry and Stevens counties.
His campaign has been prosecuted on
the theory that one citizen's vote is as
good as another's, and all classes have
been given an opportunity to hear him.
In a thirteen-day period 92 addresses
were delivered, ranging from set
speeches to brief talks made before
school children, thresher crews, miners
and apple pickers. At several places
in the mining districts the candidate
went down into the mines to meet the
miners and acquaint them with his
position on national questions directly
affecting them and the country.

Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, October 13, 1916
DEMOCRATIC RALLY
IN FIREMEN'S HALL
County Candidates, Amos, Pool and Han
nan, and Congressman Dill Ex
pound the Doctrine
Over a hundred men and some ten
or fifteen women attended the demo
cratic rally at Firemen's hall Monday
evening. Col. Fox acted as chairman
and introduced the speakers. Mr. A.
J. Amos, candidate for county treas
urer, led off in a few brief remarks
anent his candidacy for county treas
ures. Among other things he told his
hearers that they need not hesitate in
giving him their support because of
his possible inability to make a two
hundred thousand dollar personal bond,
as the law provided for that. A bond
ing company would investigate his
record and if it was clear would furnish
the bond.
Mr. S. 0. Pool, of Wenatchee, a
one time newspaper man, employed on
the Wenatcnee Republic, candidate
for representative in the legislature,
was the next speaker. Mr. Pool de
voted more time to boosting the can
didacy of Congressman Dill than his
own. He referred also to the fact that
he himself was somewhat inclined to
support men for office that accomplish
results and indicate fitness to serve the
public.
Mr. G. G. Hannum, of Wenatchee,
democratic candidate for county attor
ney, was the third speaker. He said
he had practiced law in Douglas and
Chelan county for eleven years and re
ferred to his record as a lawyer, and
pledged if elected that he would give
the county a fearless and impartial ad
ministration of the duties of county at
torney.
Hon. C. C. Dill, of Spokane, candi
date for reelection to congress on the
democratic licket, was the fourth and
last speaker. Of course he gave the
democratic party credit for all the good
things that have befallen this country
in the past four years. He conveyed
the impression that he was solely re
sponsible for the opening of the Col
ville Indian reservation to settlement,
and the Spokane reservation to the lo
cation of mining claims. He closed
with a reference to the eight hour leg
islation in the closing hours of the re
cent session of congress, and pointed
out the hardships that would have re
sulted to the fruitgrowers of the We
natchee valley if the strike had been
allowed to come off as called by the
four railroad brotherhoods.
Mr. Dill is a very good speaker and
presents his side of the political case
before the voters with the skill of the
average politician. He had close at
tention and frequent applause.
Activity At Blewett—Taking Out
Gold
Thad Neubauet spent several days
here this week. Since John Olden
passed to the great beyond a year ago,
Thad enjoys the distinction of being
the oldest miner at this oldest mining
camp in the state of Washington. He
tells us that for the past two months
the camp has taken on some of the old
time activity. Some twelve men are
employed about the property of the
Meteor Mining Co. Some are re
pairing the old mill which was badly
damaged by the heavy snow of last
winter. Others are working in the
Black Jack tunnel taking out ore
which shows free gold.
Work is also being prosecuted on
the North Star group of claims. Mr.
Neubauer says everybody about the
camp is looking forward to a period of
much activity. Of course the high
price ot metal of all kinds is responsi
ble for the revival of interest in the
mines of Blewett.
Mr. S. P. Nelson, from Lochslay,
Wash., west of the Cascades, arrived
here yesterday on one of her periodical
visits to Leavenworth. She is inter
ested in Leavenworth real estate and
1 wants to keep posted on conditions.
The Last Sheep Shipent
Geo. Hendricks shipt three cars of
sheep to Vancouyer, B. C.. this week.
This closes the shipment of fat sheep
for this season. Mr. Hendricks tells
tells the Echo that he shipt upwards
of seven thousand fat sheep to the
different markets this season, of which
five thousand were lambs. Fat lambs
brought the highest price ever known
this season, the price going well over
$7 per head, and everybody that
knows Geo. Hendricks knows, too,
that he usually gets the top price for
whatever he parts with. He says all
his stock sheep are on their winter
range. The past summer be had sev
eral large flocks in the Okanogan
country beside-three or four flocks on
the Wenatchee nationat forest.
GOVERNOR LISTER MADE
TWO ADDESSES HERE
Talked to the School Children at 2
O'clock and Kumtux Club
at 3 P. M
Governor Lister arrived here shortly
after 12 o'clock Wednesday afternoon
from Wenatchee, coming up thru the
valley in Mr. 0. S. Sampson's car.
He was entertained at luncheon at the
home of Mr. Geo. L. Gardner. By
arrangement he made a brief address
to the school children at 2 o'clock,
confining his remarks chiefly to school
matters.
At 3 o'clock he made his principal
speech in response to an invitation
from the Kuratux Club, at the Scenic
theater. The Hagler orchestra furn
ished excellent music while the aud
ience was assembling. When he be
gan his talk the theater was well filled.
All the stores having agreed to close
from 3 to S o'clock, which gave all
who cared to hear the Governor's
speech on good roads and prohibition
an opportunity to do so. The stage
was decorated with autumn leaves.
Mayor Day presented the Governor,
He was beard with careful attention
when he said while the state was
spending a considerable sum of money
on roads the most of it remained right
here in the state because labor re
ceived about seventy-five per cent of
every dollar that was expended on
road improvement, and found its way
into circulation among the people,
and in the meantime we were getting
a system of public highways of which
every man in the state could be justly
proud. Under state administration it
was the purpose to build highways
across the state leaving to the counties
the work of connecting the different
communities with the trunk lines.
Good roads, ne said, would add to the
value of all agricultural lands, would
make farming more attractive and help
more than anything else in bringing
into use the undeveloped agricultural
lands in the stat of Washington. In
inducing immigration to our state good
roads would do an incalculable amount
of good. It would make our timber
and mines accessible. It would, on
account of the scenic attractions of
this state, bring a vast amount of tourist
travel to Washington.
He closed his address by reference
to the initiative measures to be voted
on at the election Nov. 7th, and made
it very plain that he was opposed to
any measure that would let down the
bars to the brewers and liquor dealers,
analyzing the brewers bill and the
fifty-room uotel bill, the first known as
initiative measure No. 24 and the latter
known as initiative measure No. 18.
That his audience was heartily in
sympathy with his stand on the liquor
question was made evident by frequent
and hearty applause.
Governor Lister is a good speaker
and presents his facts plainly and
forcibly. He made a good impression.
From here he went to Cashmere
where be was billed to make an ad
dress to the women's club of that

LISTER MOST EXPENSIVE
GOV. STATE EVER HAD
Made Promises He Would Reduce Ex
penses—The Record Points an
Accusing Finger at Him
Four years ago, when campaigning
for office. Governor Lister promised
again and again that if elected he would
remain on the job at Olympia and give
the people a business administration
with strictest attention to his duties.
He scored his opponent for what he
termed unnecessary absence from offi
cial duties and too much traveling
about the state.
The record shows that Gov. Lister
has violated these pledges in the most
flagrant manner. He has spent more
time traveling about the state and less
time attending to his duties at Olympia
than any other executive in the history
of the state.
In the first 29 months of his admin
istration he spent an average of but
15.6 days of each month at the state
capitol. The balance of the time he
was flitting about the state or the
country attending social gatherings,
political meetings and public events
playing politics while the people paid
him liberally for expenses and he drew
his salary of $6,000 a year for work
unperformed.
He has been the most expensive ex
ecutive this state has ever maintained.
In the first two and half months of his
administration he spent 15,263.40 out
of funds appropriated for mansion and
maintenance and improvement, while
his predecessor spent but $4,889.51 in
21/4 months. In the first two years
and three months of his administration
he spent $15,251.00 for a like purpose
as against the $4,839.51 expended by
his predecessor in practically the same
length of time.
Included in this extravagance were
items of personal expense amounting
to $863.77 for the purpose which later
the attorney general instructed the
state auditor should not be allowed.
This amount has not been refunded to
the state, however. Other items ot
questionable propriety, to say nothing
of legality, were a phonograph and
records, $276.25; greenhouse, garage
and gardner's cottage (not authorized
by the legislature) $5,739.87; five
gallons of oysters, $15,00; humidor,
$24.00; footman, $5.00; a hat (dis
allowed) $12.00, and many similar
items.
His chief economies consisted of a
reduction of his stenographer's salary
of $25.00 per month and a reduction
of salary of his secretary, which was
applied on the salary of another office
employe. The reduciion of the ste
nographer's salary was nearly offset by
one item alone, that of cut flowers for
the governor's desk. It was the ex
posure of this personal extravagance
that caused the governor to build a
greenhouse and garage out of the state's
money at a cost of $5,739.89 that he
might continue to have cut flowers
without being embarrassed by publica
tion of the cost of that little vanity.
In the first 27 months of his admin
istration Governor Lister spent $1,209.
--45 for transportation expenses, which
indicates that he traveled 48,376 miles,
or a daily average of 60 miles. In 24
months his predecessor spent but
$458.74 for transportation expense.
This is the manner in which Gover
nor lister has kept his promise of econ
omy and a strict attention to the busi
ness of the state.

Rev. f. L. Moore Pounded
Last Thursday evening at Urn con
clusion of prayer meeting service in
the Methodist church, Rev. Moore was
given a genuine surprise. His con
gregation recently decided unanimous
ly to recall him to the Leavenworth
pastorate, and the surprise was by way
of augmenting and emphasizing the
good will of his congregation. The
surprise was a pound party pulled off
in the church parlors at the conclusion
of the prayer meeting. It was not a
staged surprise but was wholly unex
pected by Mr. Moore, who was over
come with emotion at the good will
offering and the many spoken words of
approval over his retention in the
Leavenworth field of work.
COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS
There was a regular meeting of the
city council Tuesday evening with
Miller, Snyder, Reynolds and Kugel
roan in their accustomed places. Also
Mayor Day, Attorney Nelson and Clerk
Brown.
Bills were allowed amounting to
$455.49.
The Mayor appointed a committee
to meet Mr. Adams with a view to
making arrangements for street lighting
the coming year.
The clerk was instructed to write to
Mr. Weile, an expert engineer of Spo
kane, and arrange a consultation with
him and Attorneys Whitney and Cor
bin regarding the Seaman & Quigg
case.
Mr. Barnum. who was employed to
furnish information and au estimate of
the probable cost of a pumping plant
made his report. It shows that an
outlay of seven or eight thousand dol
lars would be required to put in a
plant adequate to the city's needs.
It is considered doubtful whether the
wood pipe in its present condition
would stand the additional strain that
would be caused by the pulsation of
the pump, however slight it might be.
Mr. Bainum suggested that a double
covering, with an air space between
the two, would keep the exposed por
tions of the pipe line from freezing.
The report, which was accompanied by
a plat showing elevation, was ordered
placed on file.
The following resolution was intro
duced and passed.
Whereas —Referendum Measure No.
7, to be submitted to the voters of
Washington at the November election,
provides that no new public utility may
be constructed in any city, even by
the city itself, without first obtaining a
certificate of public necessity and con
venience from the public service com
mission, and
Whereas —It appears that this limi
tation would have the effect of prohib
iting cities from acquiring or construct
ing public utilities for the benefit of
their citizens and would inevitably in
crease the purchase price which a
municipality would have to pay in tak
ing over any privately owned utility.
Now Therefore, Be it Resolved.
That we urge and recommend to all
voters within the City of Leavenworth
that they vote against the Public Ser
vice utilities measure, known as Refer
endum Measure No. 7.
Ordinance No. 175, printed in an
other part of this paper, recived its
final reading and was passed by a unan
imous vote.
An ordinance authorising payment
of a reward for evidence furnished ifl
bootlegging and gambling cases was
introduced.
The clerk wai instructed by the
Mayor to prepare a list of delinquent
water users. It is proposed to enforce
the law and shut off the water of those
who do not square up.
Notice to Voters.
Pursuant to law, notice is hereby
given that the registration books of the
City of Leavenworth will be closed to
the registration of voters twenty days
prior to the General Sute Election to
be held November 7th, 1916, to wit:
October 17th, 1916. Kindly see to
the matter of registering or you can
not vote. A. R. Brown,
City Clerk.
