H Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct. 6, 1916.
B Mr. Chas. S. Wilkincon, editor Iron
M County Record, Cedar City, Utah.
HBa Dear Sir. I am attaching hereto
H clipping from the Deseret News of
H October 4th, containing cut and write-
H up of our exhibit of agricultural prod-
H ucts from Washington, Iron, Beaver
H and Millard counties.
H Iron county this year sent up a good
H variety of her farm products, some of
H which carried away prizes, and the
H interest displayed by visitors will
H eurely repay us all.
BH To County Agricultural Agent, Mr.
BBf Esplin, who gathered the exhibits, as
BBf well as assisted in their installation,
BBi is due a whole lot of credit and our
BBJ thanks. Yours truly,
B J. H. MANDERFIELD,
HBf The article referred to as published
BBf by the News follows:
f The Salt Lake Route has this year
BBf duplicated its successful exhibits of
BBf several years past in the horticultural
BBj building at the state fair grounds and
HBs in many respects the exhibit is more
BBj beautiful ana impressive than ever be-
HBJ fore.
HB There are exhibits, in separate di-
BB visions of the big corner booth occu-
BH pied by the Salt Lake Route, f-om
BB Washington, Millard, Beaver and Iron
BBf counties ana from the Newcastle pro-
BB ject and the Malone Co-operative Ex-
BB pcrimental Farm. In each is shown
BB prize-winning specimens of grain,
BH fruits, nuts and vegetables.
H Almonds a Feature.
BB Separate showcases are devoted to
BjBj exhibits of grain and other products,
WkM notably from the Nephi experimental
BB farm, which has produced a wide
BB variety of fine grains and the farm of
BH Thomas Judd & Sons at La Verkin,
BB Utah, from which are entered pome-
BB granates, nuts and a selection of trop-
BB ical and semi-tropical fruits and pro-
BH ducts of other sortR. In all, the "Dix-
BB ie" section of Utah has contributed
BH largely to the display, a showing of
BB paper-shell almonds being noteworthy.
BH Other showcases are given to the dis-
BH plays of individual growerB, one case
BH containing an especially fine exhibit
BH of apples from the orchard of W. H.
WM Homer of Pleasant Grove.
BB The display of products from the
BH Malone experimental farm is very in-
BH tereBting. This farm comprises a tract
BB of 20 acres 17 miles north of Milford,
H Beaver county, Utah, in the Escalante
BH valley, and those interested in the
BH farm are the Utah Conservation com-
H mission, the Utah Agricultural college,
H the Salt Lake Route, U. S. depart-
H ment of Agriculture, Fairbanks-Morse
BH & Company and the Utah Oil Refining
BB company.
H Irrigation by Wells.
H The display contains many speci-
BH mens of grain and vegetables ruised
BH on the tract through irrigation of the
BH surface acreage by underground wat-
BH er- which is found at from 15 to w
H 'eet below the surface, according to
H the wells so far sunk. The exact flow
H of water must be yet determined to a
H certainty, though the experiments
H have proved the feasibility of thiR plan
BH of irrigation, and a flow of SCO gallons
BH a minute has been obtained, sufficient
H to irrigate 96 acres.
H Ab the d'splay in the booths of the
BH Salt Lake Route comes from widely
BH separated localities along the line of
BH the road, it may be considered as a
BH comprehensive exhibit of products and
f irogress in the farming communities
n the western and southwestern por-
H tions of the state.
H SIMON BAMBERGER SPKAKS
H Friday night, Oct. fth, Simon Bam-
H berger, Democratic nominee of guber-
B natorial honors, and R'd W. Young,
H a Democratic spell-binder, addressed
M the people of Cedar City, giving rea-
H sons why in their opinions the voters
H of this place should support the Demo-
H cratic nominees in the coming election.
H Mr. Bamberger made a strong point
H of the extravigance of the republican
H administration in the state, and laid
H emphasis upon the statement that the
H governor's office has a $5,000 rug,
H while a home-made rag carpet could
H be made to answer the purpose just
B as well.
H Republicans who wore present said
H that they did not mind "Uncle Simon"
H BO much, but that his companion was
Hh nothing but a "wind-jammer."
H Democrats present assert that it
H wu an excellent rally.
STEAM LAUNDRY
TO OPEN SOON
Quarters Nearly Ready and Machinery
Being Received and Stored
for Installation.
The new quarters for the Cedar
City Steam Laundry are nearing com
pletion, and the machinery is being
received and housed there. Mr. Parry
has secured the services of Robert O'
Neal, a machinist and 'aunderer of
experience, who will have charge of
the installation and operation of the
plant, and Mr. Parry states that lie
expects to have it in operation within
about three weeks.
When in Salt Lake City recent lv Mr.
Parry increased his original order for
machinery to the extent of a thousand
dollars, which will bring the equip
ment right up to the minute and give
the plant the very latest devices in use
in the large city laundries.
While Mr. Parry states that he will
be perfectly satisfied if the plant pays
interest on the investment for the fust
year or two. trusting to the future,
after the people of the county get
fully educated up to the business, for
his ultimate profits, yet the outlook is
that it will be a profitable investment
from the. beginning.
Many of the housewives of Cedar
City and nearby towns are impatient
ly waiting for the laundry to open for
business.
GEORGE H. CROSBY, SR.,
DIES AT SAINT GEORGE
Tidings were received last Wednes
day by friends in this city of the death
at St. George of George H. Crosby,
Sr., who made his home there some
thing less than a year ago, moving
there from Wyoming.
Deceased is a well known figure in
southern Utah, in the Mormon colon
ies of Arizona, and also in Wyoming.
He has served as bishop in a number
of places, including Hebron, in the
early settlement of that place, before
the present town of Enterprise was
thought of, in Leeds, during the palmy
days of Silver Reef, and in one or
more towns in Arizona. He was a
man universally liked, and had a hnp
py faculty of making friends, which
gave him a very extended acquaint
anceship. George was the eldest of a family
of four brothers the others being
Jesse, for a number of years presi
dent of the PaitguHch stake, Samuel,
who also resided In Panuuitch, and
Joshua, of St. George. All his broth
ers preceded him to the other side.
Mrs. Elida Snow, a sister residing in
St. George, survives him.
He is also survived by a number of
sons and daughers, most of whom re
side in Arizona, and some of whom
are prominent in business and politics
there. The funeral has been postponed
to Sunday afternoon in order to give
the members of the family an oppor
tunity to attend the services, which
will also be 'attended by a number of
people from this place.
Deceased was 70 years of age, and
his health had been on the decline for
the past two years, though it was not
regarded as serious until within the
put few months.
George Crosby was an honorable
and upright citizen, and did his full
share for the uplifting of humanity
while on earth. He will be greatly
r Issed by all who have had the pleas
ure of his acquaintance.
MRS. W. W. DALLEY SUC
CUMBS TO OPERATION.
Word has just been received here of
the death at Salt Lake City of Mrs.
W. W. Dalley of Summit, who was
operated on for cancer, and died yes
terday . The remains are being sent
home for burial, and the funeral ser
vices will be held in Summit tomorrow
afternoon.
Mrs. Dalley and her husband are
among the old settlers of that place
and are highly respected. Her many
friends will be grieved to learn of her
demise, and no doubt a number of peo
ple from Cedar City will be in attend
ance at the funeral.
Robert Gordon Gets Final Summon.
Last Sunday night, at his home in
Huntington, Emery county, Robert
Gordon, father of Sirs. MtjQMT Dalley'
of this place and of Mrs. A. E. Loon-J
Mt&i who resided hero for a time, an-
.-.wered the finul summons and passed i
to the great beyond. Mrs. Dalley left i
Monday via Lund to attend the funei - ,
al. Deceased was 87 years old, and
death is supposed to be due to general
debility.
Despondency.
When you feel discouraged and des
pondent do not give up but take a dole
of Chamberlain's Tablet! and you are
almost certain to feel all right within
a day or two. Despondency is very
often due to indigestion and bilious
ness, for which these tebleti are es
pecially valuable. Obtainable cvery

OPEN SEASON FOR DEER

Next Sunday. I I 18th, tile.
season opens for Hie killing of deer.
During the ir dayi between the irth
and the :!()tb. each e. Ment of the
state has the privi! ge of kiling one
male dear, providing he purchases a
license so to do, and providing fur
ther, of course, he can find the deer

enable him to shoot it.
A number of li "' iporti are pre
j paring to try their lii"k, and will set
I out tomorrow in various directions in

The weather seems to be rather
, propitious for the purpose. Stormy
weather, and particularly a fresh fall
of snow, is the sort of weather the
huntsman Wt as it makes the
tracking of the game easy.

PRICE OF PAPER IS
CAUSING APPUEHFXSION
J. L. Peterson, salesman for Car
penter Paper company, was here call
ing upon the trade recently, says the
; Duchesne Record. He gives the infor
mation that on nearly all classes of
paper the price has been advanced a
bout one hundred per cent over what
it was a year aeo. Not only has the
price doubled, but on such items as
news print the supply is very limited
and unless something is done to re
lieve it, there is apprehension through
out the country thut many country
dailies and weeklies, which depend on
the open market for their suplies, will
be forced out of business for the two
fold reason that the price il becoming
almost prohibative and also that print
lias nearly disappeared.
The above from the Duchesne paper
is very true of the present paper mar
ket and the situation is adding much to
the already serious problems that con
front the papers, both large and small,
throughout the country. As a result
of the advance in the price of paper
and other supplies, thousands and
thousands of newspapers throughout
the United States have increased the
subscription price of their publica
tions and a great many have also ad
vanced their advertising rates.
As yet The Record has not decided
upon an increase in its subscription
price, and our advertising rates re
main the same; but such a move may
be necessary at anv time in the fu
ture, and our advice to subscribers is
to keep their accounts paid a year in
advance. This will not only protect
you against a possible increase during
that period, but will help materially to
prevent tbe necessity of such an in
crease on our part.
COAL FAMINE PROBABLE.
Ah a result of the havy rains and
floods which have washed out the can
yon road quite badly, making it im
possible to get to the mines in the
I canyon until considerable work has
been done, it seems probable that we
will experience at least a temporary
coal famine, for there is very little
coal in town al p and the sud
den change In the weather has made
a strong demand for fuel.
Of eoures, there are the mines on
the side of the mountain that may be
drawn on in the Interern, but i't is
doubtful if either of them is in an
immediately workable condition.
This is a time whan we feel the need
of the tram to the Green property on
the face of the mountain near town;
then there would be an abundance of
coal for local consumption and to sup
ply the section of country tributary to
Cedar City at all times, regardless of
the freaks of Coal ('reek, and by the
way there is every indication that the
tram proposition will bo put through.
A goodly number of local people,
some of whom, at least, are amply
able, have promised their support in
the organization of a company, and
apparently as soon as the preliminar
ies can be attended to a corporation
to take the proposition over will be
launched.
We are informed that a meeting of
those who have expressed their wil
lingness to become stockholders is to
be held in a few days, for the purpose
of Incorporating the company, which
will include prominent and influential
men from several southern counties.

CELEBRATE THEIR
GOLDEN WEDDING
Mr. and Mrs. Jos. II. Armstrong Have
Happy4 Surprise on 50th Anni
versary of Wedding Day.
Monday, Oct. !tth, was the golden
wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H.
Armstrong, of this city and Enoch,
. and the event was duly commemorated
by a large gathering of relatives and
intimate friends at the last named
ti.wn. A pleasant feature of the oc
casion was the surprise by their un
expected presence of Mr. Armstrongs
brother, John G. Armstrong, his wife
and youngest daughter from Salt Lake
City, and of his son Joseph S. Arm
ttrong, from Idaho, with his wife,
daughter and three of his grand child
ren. In all covers were laid at the
noon-day luncheon for 10H persons,
seven children, thirty-nine grand-children
and three great grand-children
of the couple being included in the
c impany.
Following the luncheon there was a
very interesting program of vocal and
Instrumental musical numbers, short
speeches, etc., given In the Enoch
meeting house.
In the evening an old time ball, set
to old time music furnished by an or
chestra led by Prof. John L. Jones,
Droved an enjoyable and interesting
feature of the occasion.
The Record joins with their friends,
who are legion, in wishing the worthy
couple many more anniversaries of
their marriage day.
REPUBLICANS HOLD RALLY
Last night at the Ward Hall the
I.e., pie of Cedar City had the privilege
of hearing the man whom the Repub
licans are assarting will bs the next
governor of the state of Utah--Nephi
L. Morris. Mr. Morris was accom

A. Smith, who kept the audience in

Morris at nearly 10 o'clock, when he
arrived from Parowan, after deliver
ing an evening address at that place.
The party included Mr. Charles Kent,
a connoil sour of colors and the fair
sex, who insists that Cedar is most
noted for the, quality of the rouge it
produces. Mr. Kent rendered some
catchy Songs OH features of the cam
Mr. Smith devoted considerable of
his time to the Mexican situation and
the Wilson method of keeping the na
tion out of war.
Mr, Morris devoted the principal
portion of his remarks to the prohib
ition question, and delivered a master
ly address on the subject of temper
ance. He said that it was a mistake
for people to suppose that the liquor
lUSStion was settled by the adoption
of a prohibition plank in their plat
by the two principal political
parties of the state; that it required
constant) persistent effort to cope with

MORI AND MORE AUTOS.

We are afraid If this show of pro
