About one hundred or more relatives
and friends of Mr. Williams of Gunter
district sprung a complete but very
agreeable surprise on him Sunday by
a birthday dinner. We hope he may
have many more pleasant surprises.
The W. C. T. U. desire to express
their thanks and appreciation to
Miss Vanhom, Jeffries, Gentry, Reed
and Whittington who made it possible
for the trip to Pioneer by kindly furn
ishing the use of their autos.
There was such a large attendance
at spelling at Gunter, Friday night,
that it was necessary to divide the
spellers and use both rooms.
What was feared was scarlet fever
in our family in this place a short
time ago, we understand has proven to
be chicken pox.
In order to determine what kind of
influence prevails in any community,
every one should consider what kind
of material is going out from the com-
munity. How many have gone out to
preach the gospel in the last ten or
twenty years? How many schooT
teachers? Or how many have been
elected to office; also how many
"cussers" and cigarette smokers ? How
many criminal cases in court? and how
many sent to the penitentiary or gal
lows ? Everyone to a great extent are
their brother's keeper, but are we on
the job?
There are usually three classes of
people in any and all communities viz.,
the workers, the shirkers and the jerk
ers. The workers devote their time
and means to get things started and
to keep them going in the communitey.
The shirkers are contented to drift
along and let others bear all the bur
den and occasionally wedge in and en
iov a little of the fruits of others' toil
and the ierkers set back on the
"breeching" and knock on every thing!
and every body knocker, pessimist,
tattler, clog-m-tne-manger, ann uoci

OBITUARY
Lawrence Andrew, the little son
of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Browning was
bom May 7, 1911, and departed from
this life October 2, 191..
At the age of 5 years, 4 monts and
25 days.
1'unera' was held at the St. Law-reni-fi
ehu? jK, 'uesday morning.
Litlte Lawrence was only sick a few
days, and his death came as a shock
to the parents and relatives.
All of the relatives were at his bed
side except those who were away and
could not get here.
No one can take his place in the
hearts of the bereaved parents and
relatives.
Everything was done to save the
precious one but it was God's will.
No more will a little voice ring
through the house no more will
mother be called on to tie a little shoe.
And a place at the table that can never
be filled.
CARD OF THANKS
We wish to thank our friends and
neighbors for their help and kindness,
through the illness and death of our
beloved child,
Also for the beautiful flowers.
