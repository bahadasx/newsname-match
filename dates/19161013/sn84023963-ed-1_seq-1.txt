"Dry" State Fills Cellar
and Swears Off
Georgia Lays in Large
Supply Before
Enforcing Lata
IVasiinglon (). C.) Herald
Georgia went dry the other day
with more liquor in the possession of
the people than has ever been known
in the history of the state. Such is
the paradoxical news from. Atlanta.
That the state has gone dry may not
be news. It is so recorded every year.
The people of Georgia adopted state
wide prohibition ncmly ten years ago
and the legislature has been amending
the law ever sir trying to make it
effective. The pi bitionists-have ad
mitted that the brand of prohibition
in Georgia did not prohibit. The
more rigid the provisions of the law,
the more indifferent have been the
people to the law. The indifference to
the prohibition luv has developed an
indifference to all law, until some re
spectable authorities in Georgia have
called the state lawless.
The last legislature in trying to
make prohibition prohibit, followed
the -example of the farmer with the
balky horse; when he couldn't make
the horse pull, he kicked an innocent
cow. The legislature amended the
law so as to permit each c.tizen to im
port two quarts of whiskey or twenty-
four q jrts of beer each month, and
then prohibited the newspapers of the
state from printing liquor advertise
ments. It must be admitted that the
law has more prohibition in it now
than it had before, but it is not
against the sale or use of liquor. It
harks back to a time when Georgia
placed restrictions on reading upon
certain parts of the population. The
Georgians may mako liquor without
taxationif they can dodfro the federal
revenue agents; they may use liquor
and import it, but they must not In
.alloiwid to read about it.
?yS&Tfc principal agitation end prepaav
ation. for thP new lav has been in cor -

The prohibitionists are n; . r
become as cautious as the p c . i
do not believe In and pi-dL ?r; I
bition. Their c:.c? is that t'i :

future. So all the people of G'oi'gi.i
have taken time by the forelock ard
stored liquors against emergencies. .
The moonshiners of Gerr.'jia appear
to be the only people in the state who
want the law to be retroactive. T'--are
opposed to storing when th uv'?
in a position to supply the d iar-1
from day to day. The economies ot'
the Internal Revenue Bureau have
compelled a reduction of the reve.n 0
agents in Georgia and the cutting ot
of the pay of informers who last yeai
. enabled the federal government to
seize and destroy about 1,500 moon
shine stills in that state. With the
curtailment of the efforts of the ft d
eral revenue officers and the sympafr; '
of local prohibition officers, the moon
shiners feel that it was a miscarrhuj
of justice to allow the people to im
port and store large quantities if
liquor before the law went inro effort.
They will make an effort to have tlie
law against storing declared retro
active. Washington ( ). C.)IfcraU, .Liy $. JO J 6

''What is electricity V is a f aror
Ite query with people who desire to
"fet a rise" out of a scientific man.
And when he fails to answer it in
tke same simple fashion that ha
might treat the question "What i
a biscuit?" the questioner cries out :
"Aha ! You profess to know ail
about electricity. Whyyou canV
tTen tell what it is!"-
