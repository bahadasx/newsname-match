day and no one not connected with the
case was permitted within fifty feet
of Cie courtroom in which Michael A.
Rofrano, a lawyer and former deputy
street cleaning commissioner of New
York, is being tried for alleged com
plicity in the murder of Michael Gia

was explained, because a menacing
"Black Hand" sign was said to have
been given to a witness who testified
for the state yesterday.
The witness, a Sing Sing convict,
was again on the stand today and
repeated a story that another man
indicte1 in the case, had told him Ro

NEUTRAL PATROL ALONG
NEW ENGLAND COAST
Three Destroyers Steam Out of New
port Harbor at Full Speed.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 12. When three
destroyers, the Jarvis, Drayton and
Fanning, steamed out of the harbor
at full speed late today It was report -td
that they would begin a neutral
patrol along the Xew Eftgland coast
as a result of the recent German sub
marine raid. Other destroyers in the
harbor were getting up steam and
making active preparations for an
early departure. Rear Admiral Aus
tin M. Knight, commandant of the
N'arragansett Bay naval station, would
not confirm the report but said that
while no official action had been taken
to put a neutrality patrol into effect,
it was probable that such a patrol
would be established within a very
short time.
From unofficial sources it was un
derstood that the destination of the
three destroyers was the eastern coast
of Maine in the vicinity of Bar Har
bor. The exact nature of their errand
was not disclosed.
W. H. TAFT FLAYS
WILSON ADMINISTRATION
For Policies It Has Put in Force Dur
ing Past Four Years.
Waterbury, Conn., Oct. 12. Ex-President
Taft delivered a speech here to
night, flaying the Wilson administra
tion for the policies it has put in
force during the past four pears. The
attitude of Mr. Wilson in signing the
Adamson eight hour railroad bill was
compared to that of a man signing a
paper with a gun under his nose. Mr.
Hughes was characterized as a strong
enough man to voice objection to the
eight hour law for railroad men when
he knew it wsa in reality not an eight
hour law, he said, even in the face of
losing the approaching election.

might pick up the liner after she was

was thought the almost simultaneous

Six Americans Aboard.
There were four Americans among

STEAMER KINGSTON IAN
IS SAFE IN PORT.
Was Thousands of Miles Away from
Nantucket Last Sunday.
Boston, Oct.. 12. The British steam
er Kingstonian, reported as among
those torpedoed by a German sub
marine off Xantu-:kct last Sunday, is
safe in port, according to word re
ceived today by John M. Thomas of
this city, 1-oca.l manager of the Leyland
line, which owns the steamer. Mr.
Thomas said his information showed
that the Kingstonian was thousands of
miles from Nantucket last Sunday.
As the Kingstonian is in the service
of the British admiralty, Mr. Thomas
was not permitted to indicate the port
at which slfe had arrived, but he said
that it would take her two weeks of
steaming at her usual speed to reach
Nantucket, so that it was evident she
was nowhere near the scene of the
submarine's operations in those waters
last Sunday.
This information serves to confirm
the opinion held by marine" men here
that the report of the Kingstonian's
loss arose from a confusion of her
name with that of the Chr Knudsen,
the Norwegian tank steamer sunk by
the U-boat.
HUGHES CAMPAIGNING
IN KENTUCKY MOUNTAINS
Declares "New Freedom" Advocated
by Wilson Means "New Slavery."
Louisville, Ky, Oct. 12. Charles
Evans Hughes went through the moun
tains of Kentucky today, a new cam
paign field for presidential nominees
utlining his views on the maintenance
of American rights and ended his day's
tour of the state with a meeting here
tonight in which he declared that the
"new freedom" advocated by Presi
dent Wilson four years ago had been
transmitted, in one respect to "the new
slavery."
Mr. Hughes spoke in six towns to
audiences that had come, for the most
part, for miles to hear him. They
came down the mountains, men and
women, on foot, on horseback and on
niuleback. Some of the mounts had
saddles, some had none and many of
the women that came to hear him came
wearing their faded sunbonnets and
smoked clay pipes as he talked. At
I'ikersville, first stop, hundreds had
journeyed since sun-up. A special
train from Marrowbone, crowded to ca
pacity, swelled the crowd.
At several stops the nominee's spe
cial train was backed down a spur
track and he spoke to audienoes in
open fields. They sat on their horses
and mules and in their farm wagons to
listen. Some brought their families
along and there were several hundred
children, including babies, in their
mothers' arms, in each of these
crowds.
In his speech in Phoenix hall here
tonight, Mr. Hughes devoted much of
his attention to the protective tariff
and to what he termed "the new slav
ery."' No less than 5,000 inventions have
been submitted to the naval board in
seyen months.
Bayonne Strikers
Fight the Police
ONE MAN WAS KILLED AND A
SCORE WOUNDED
MOB BURNED SHEDS
To Restore Order the Militia and Po
lice Were Forced to Fire Volley
After Volley of Rifle and Pistol Shots
Into the Ranks of the Strjkers.
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 12. One man
was killed and at least a score wound
ed, two of them so seriously they are
not expected to live, in a pitched bat
tle here today between striking em
ployes of the Standard Oil company
and the police. The fight was the
culmination of a series of disturb
ances which began Wednesday and
continued throughout last night and
today. New Jersey militiamen, back
from duty along the Mexican border,
who were sworn in as special police
men, aided in dispersing the rioters,
who were terrorising the city by loot
ing and burning.
Police Fire Volley After Volley.
Half a dozen sheds overlooking the
oil refineries were set on fire before
the authorities were able to restore a
semblance of order by firing volley
after volley of rifle and pistol shots
into the ranks of the strikers and
their sympathisers.
An Outsider Killed.
Isidnor Natilisky, 22 years old, a
lawyer, who had no part in the rioting
late today, was the man killed. He
was shot through the back, it was
said, while running from the scene
and fell dead.
Harris Martin, aged 19, a bystander,
was shot through the lwng and prob
ably will die. Edward Green, aged 30,
was also shot through the lung and
probably will die, physicians said.
Five Men in Hospitals.
Five others are in hospitals from
wounds. The police report that more
than a dozen strikers and their sym
pathizers who were injured were car
ried to their homes. As far as could
be learned, none of the policemen or
the militiamen was hurt. A fireman,
however, was shot and wounded ear
lier in the day while attempting to
attach a hose to a hydrant in an ef
fort to drive away a crowd which, it
ws said, was attempting to loot and
wreck several stores.
Sniping From Housetops.
Attempts at sniping from housetops
and a report that tha jtrikers had
purchase -omany- revolvers in Jersey
City led the authorities to take dras
tic action. As soon as they were re
inforced by the militiamen, the police
took thirty strikers prisoners and
started off to raid the saloons which
had defied an order ta close.
Missiles From Roofs.
As the advance guard entered the
strike area they were met by a show
er of missiles from roofs and door
ways. They immediately opened fire,
which was returned by the strikers
and their sympathizers. The latter,
enraged by the fight with the police
Wednesday night in which one woman
was killed and many of their number
wounded, had announced that the po
lice who attacked them would "come
back in boxes."
Surrounded by Militia.
The militiamen formed one of sev
eral columns directed by the police to
surround the strikers and their sym
pathizers. The shooting began as
soon as the columns closed in on the
rioters.
Business Places to Close.
So serious had the situation become
tonight that the Bayonne business
men's association announced its mem
bers all would ciose their stores dur
ing the continuance of the strike. They
asked for police protection. As groc
ery stores, which had been patronized
by the strikers, are to be included in
the closing, further trouble is feared.
The Central Railroad of New , Jer-
sey has taken precautions to prevent
recurrence of attacks made on passen
gers and railroad employes. One hun
dred armed guards were sent to Bay
onne late today to patrol the com
pany's property there.
STEAMER MADRAS WAS
BROUGHT BACK TO PORT
Had Ignored Torpedo Boat Destroyer's
Signal to Stop.
New York, Oct. 12. The British
steamship City of Madras was over
hauled off Ambrose Channel lightship
tonight by the United States torpedo
boat destroyer Sterrett and brought
back to Clifton, Staten Island, afer it
had ignored the war vessel's signal t'o
stop when it left Quarantine.
The City of Madras, a vessel of 3,
0S4 tons, cleared from this port Mon
day for Singapore, Manila and Hong
Kong but anchored above Quarantine,
apparently fearful of a submarine at
tack if she ventured to sea.
As the ship passed Quarantine to
night on her way out she was signall
ed by the Sterret to stop. Ignoring the
order, the steamer raced down the
harbor at full speed and was not over
taken by the Sterret until she had
passed through Ambrose Channel and
was abreast the channel lightship. .
The Sterret returned up the harbor
with its captive.
It was said at Quarantine late to
night th the City of Madras would
be permitted to sail tomorrow morn
ing as her clearance papers are cor
rect. She was forced to turn . back,
it was alleged, because she failed to
obey an order of a United States war
ship on patrol duty.

Herr Bassermann laced a full house
when he arose to deliver the report,

representatives of the government par
ticipating. All the naval, technical.
military, economic arid political aspects
were thoroughly investigated and
weighed. The-deliberations were con

man submarine early Sunday morning
and was later allowed to proceed to
this port and took on horses for Genoa,
Italy, is now expected to sail tomor
row. The delay in her departure on
account of fear of the submarine off
the coast has been costly to her char

said, as the charter price is under
stood to be $2,300 a day, or nearly $100
an hour. She is owned by the American-Hawaiian

ON SUBMARINES
a general desire to serve the interests
of the fatherland.
"An agreement could not be reached
in the committee, which therefore re
frained from making a decision. The
committee recommends that the reich
stag in its deliberations abstain from
a discussion of submarine warfare. It
bases this attftude upon the stand
point that a thorough discussion of tho
naval, technical, military, economic
and political , details is impossible
without injur: to the interests of tho
fatherland, but on the other hand that
without such thorough discussion the
subject could not be completely cleared
up.
The recommendation had been
adopted by a vote of 2 4 to 4. the dis
senters being conservative and radical
socialist committeemen.
Dr. Peter Spahn, the leader of the
Catholic cenler party, followed Herr
Bassermann, but his speech was large
ly inaudible to the gallsry. He was
understood to soy that he left to the
imperial chancellor the decision on the
propriety of making at some future
time further announcements regarding"
submarine ivarfare. Germany's atti
tude toward other countries, particu
larly America, which were extensively
discussed in committee, must be based,
said Dr. Spahn, not upon sympathies
or antipathies, but upon Germany's
own interests.
Philipp Scheidenmann, socialist, em
barked upon a vigorous denunciation
of the elements hostile to Chancellor'
von Bethmann-Hellweg which for
months, he declared, had shrunk from
no methods, however base, to over
throw the chancellor and prevent the
reforms which he had promised.
Major Bassermann, while avoiding a
discussion of the submarine issue in
his remarks, injected a tribute to Ad
miral von Tirpitz and the achievements
of the submarine 17-53.
STUDYING LEGAL SIDE
OF THE U-53 RAID
Officials Busy Fixing the Status of
Submersibles.
Washington, Oct. 12. Government
officials were considering today the
question of whether the United States
should acknowledge the raid of the
GemTin war submarine U-53 on allied
shipping off Nantucket last Sunday aa
legal.
The problem was regarded as oj
great importance, not only in its re
lation to that particular raid, but be
cause of the probability that it might
establish a precedent affecting possible
future submarini.actions of similar na
ture. Much forethought was being given to
potential developments, such as that
German undersea boats might be able
to extend their operations to such an
extent as to effect practically a block
ade of, American ports or that the al
lied powers might decide to press hard
er their claims that entry of Ameri
can ports be denied all underwater
craft of belligerents. Resting on de
termination of this nation's attitude to
ward the work of the U-53 is the mat
ter of soliciting indemnity for Ameri
can cargoes lost with the sunken ships.
Only if the ships were sunk illegally
may claims be entered.
