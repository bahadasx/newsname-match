NEWPORT
John W. Kelley, ex-mayor of
Newport died at his home on
Nye Creek, Sunday, October 8th,
after a lingering illness of more
than a year, aged 53 years, 4
months and ten days. Mr. Kel
ley was first afflicted with In
flammatory rheumatism which
affected his nerves and produced
paralysis that finally caused his
death. He went to Shepard
Springs in the hope that it would
benefit his health but he came
home about 8 months ago and
the greater part of that time he
was confined to his bed and
gradually grew worse until the
end came. Mr. Kelley belonged
to a very prominent pioneer fam
ily. He was born in Oregon City
In 1853 and spent most of his
life in that city. He was prom
inently connected with news
paper work. He was editor of
the Oregon City Enterprise,
Oregon Statesman and for a
while worked on the Oregonian
staff. He was a man of liberal
views and of more than ordi
nary Intelligence. He came to
Newport In 1912 and bought the
Irvin House and changed the
name to Hotel Kelley, where he
lived up to the time of his death,
He was elected mayor of the city
In 1913 and served one term
He was publicspirited and did
much while mayor to improve
the condition of city. He took
special interest In and did much
to boost the building the West
Coast railroad, but he did not
live to see the fruitions of his
hopes. He was a Republican In
politics a Progressive. He is
survived by his wife and one son,
Robert, who lives at Newport.
The remains were taken to Ore
gon City for burial. He will be
missed in this community.
Sheriff Geer, Al Schwartz, Al
ex McMillan and C. E. Hawkins
went to Yachats to attend the
community fair that Is being
held there. These gentlemen
are candidates for office and
wished to get acquainted and
lneet the people and familiarize
themselves with the conditions
of the country and to understand
the people better, who live in It.
Mr. Geer Is for re-election but
he Is so well known and makes
Buch an efficient officer that he
needs no Introduction. Messers.
Hawkins, Schwartz and McMil
lan are also well known and well
quallified to fill the offices to
which they aspire. No doubt
. they will enjoy this visit and the
meeting of the many friends
they have In that section of the
county.
Hon. Gus. C. Mosher of Port
land, will speak at the Midway
Theatre, Saturday, October 14.

fighting. "Eternal vigllence is
the price of liberty." If anyone
tears down the American flag,
shoot him on the spot. (General
Uix). I hope it has not come
to that pass where we are too
weak to defend ourselves.
Newport will be well repre
sented at the fair held at Eddy-
vllle Wednesday. The weather

pected to be present.
