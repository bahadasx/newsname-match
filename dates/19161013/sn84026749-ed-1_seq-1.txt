FIGHT TO HOLD
RIVAL'S STOCK
Court Orders Sale of Shares in
Georgetown Company, But
Refuses Dissolution.
PARTIAL VICTORY FOR BOTH
Hume Request to Distribute
Proceeds as Dividend of
Washington Firm Quashed.
The District Supreme Court today
passed upon the famous controversy
over the ownership of the capital stock
In tho Georgetown Gas Light Company
by tho Washington Gas Light Company.
Tho opinions given In the four sepa
rate suits nied in 1913, are made by Jus
tices Gould and Stafford, who hoard tho
cases whllo sitting Jolntlyln the litiga
tion, i
Tho court holds as follows:
Rofuses the dissolution of the Wash
ington Gas Light Company, as asked by
the late E. H. Thomas, then corporation
counttel. . . . ,
Orders the Washington Gas Light
Company to sell its holdings In tho
Georgetown company, amounting to
3.K0 shares of tho total of 6.000 shares
of capital stock.
Denies tho request of the Georgetown
Gas Light Company that tho stock be
turned back into tho treasury of tho
Georgetown company.
Violates Act of 1913
In disposing of tho request for disso
lution of tho Washington company, tho
opinion holds thot whllo 1U holding of
stock In tho Georgetown concern Is In
violation of the public utilities act of
1913. It Is not such an Infraction as to
Justify the dissolution sought.
Holding that the Washington com
pany was without power to purchase
the stock, the cotrrt directs that a
sale be made of the 3,630 shares nnd
tho proceeds be added to the treasury
of the Washington company.
The opinion also gives to the pur
chasers of the stock the dividends
which hvo accrued to the stock dur
ing the miration. ,
This fliidlng Is made In ihe suit
brought byj:jioaorgetown campar.y
asking thartTftrirtock certificates lw
cancelled and the shares returned to
the petitioner. j
The suit brought by Thomas L.
Hume, a stockholder of the Washing
ton company, asking for the sale of
the disputed shares and a distribu
tion of the proceeds as dividends
smong the stockholders, was dis
missed. Authorizes Foreclosure
The opinion also authorizes Joseph
Letter to foreclose on 3,000 shares of
stock belonging to Mr. Hume and
held by Letter as collateral for a
loan of $260,000 made In 1912.
The court's holding extends to coun
sel tho prlvllcgo or making sugges
tions as to the time and terms of
tale of the disputed Bhares.
In ruling on the dissolution matter,
the opinion finds that the utilities act
giving the Public Utilities Commis
sion "Jurisdiction in equity to dis
solve, any public utility" for violation
of tho law's provisions Is not manda
tory, but leaves the matter to the
discretion of the court.
The court declares that the record In
the caso falls to disclose a situation that
would Justify the exercise of the discre
tion vested In the court to the extent
of forfeiting the charter of the cor
poration "becauso twenty years before

Mme. Butterfly
BALTIMORE. Oct. 13,-Just as the
Aborn English Opera Company was
planning to put on "Madam butterfly"
at the Lyric It was discovered that a
recently enacted city ordinance! might
make the production of the opera an
Impossibility In Baltimore for all time
unless presented In a form horribly
mangled by the pollco censors. Tho
ordinance reads:
" 'The Star-Bpangled Danner' shall
not be played, sung, or rendered ln
Baltimore In any public place or at any
public entertainment, or In any theater,
except as an entire and separate com
position of national or other melodies."
Unfortunately, the opera contains
throughout Its score repetitions of the
anthem, and Chief of Ifollco Carter Is
taking no chances.

LATTER RUNS OUT AT NIGHT
White Star Steamer Takes
Chance With ' $8,000,000
Cargo and 242 Passengers.
NEWPORT, H. I., Oct. u.
The radio station here today re
ceived a report from an uniden
tified steamer stating that she
had sighted the German subma
rine U-B3 well off Nantucket
shoals at 7 o'clock this morning.
NKW YOIIK. Oct. U.-Two great
transatlantic liners today are in the
new danger zone created by the sub
marlno activities off the coast of the
United States.
And much anxiety exists' here In
shipping Intorcsts and among friends of
those on hoard.
One Is the Fronch liner Lafayette. In
bound, with a number of prominent
Americans and a costly cargo. The
other Is the British steamship Adriatic,
outbound, with Jtt passengers, six of
them Americans, and t8.O0O.00Q worth
of war munitions and other freight In
Jjer hold.
The Adriatic, with Hunts out, dashod
to sea last night In dflance of the
menace from the undersea German ter
rors, believed to be lurking off the
coast.
She anchored off the Ambrose Chan
nel Lightship after swinging from her
North river pier yesterday afternoon,
and stood like a silent sentinel of tho
sesa In the moonlight of the early
night.
Then, as the silvery rays began to
grow dim, Capt. Joseph Ransom save
the order for the run Into the danger
zone with her precious cargto of human
life and war supplies.
Dashes South From Regular Lanes.
From her anchorage, the giant ocean
greyhound dashed south from the regu
lar lanes of travel to minimize the
likelihood of stopping a possible torpedo
from the big German submarines, and
under full steam speeded to her fate
out on tho Atlantic.
What this would be gave cause for
much anxiety here. No one could tell
whether It was to be a berth at the
bottom of tho sea or safe arrival at
Liverpool, whither sho is bound.
When sho disappeared in the night
all the lifeboats of tho Adriatic on
her upper tier were uncovered and their
ropes were carefully colled so the boats
could be lowered almost Instantly.
Americans Aboard.
The six Americans aboard are Mr. and
Mrs. William J. Wilson of this city,
who travel In the saloon; R. O, Bras
slngton and H. A. Emerson, a butter
and egg merchant of this city, oc
cupying second cabin accommodations.
In the steerage are two Filipinos who
are American citizens.
FUty-flvo of the other passengers
are survivors of the British steamships
West Point and Strath&ene, sunk off
Nantucket.
The Cunarder freighter Pannonla,
which followed the Adriatic, did not
anchor, but headed south, hugging the
uvtavj c.u.c . lie . nmiuiiin i. uuuuu
for London, and her usual course would
be east.
Thirteen Ships Sail.
In all thlrten steamships, most ot
them heavily freighted with munitions
and supplies, sailed from Now York
yesterday. The British vessels were, be
sides the Adriatic and Pannonla, the
Minnehaha, a giant freighter of tho At
lantic Transport Line, the Cunarder St.
George, the steamships Silvercedar,
Toftwood and Saxolelne, the Scandinavian-American
liner Heltlg Olav,
another Danish ship, one Dutch, one
Greek, one Norwegian and one Uru
guayan. The Hclllg Olav, bound for Copen
hagen, had 3T6 passengers. Among these
waa I C. Helvcglarsen, former gover
nor of tho Danish West Indies, and
Major N. C. Kerth, of Washington on
the way to Potrograd on official busi
ness. It became apparent yesterday that
the only probable result ot placing all
allied ships In Atlantic porta of this
country under the orders ot the British
admiralty would be not to delay de
parture, but to expedite them.
That United States destroyers aro
now patrolling along the three-mile limit
was made known when the Munton
Line steamship Munomar came In from
Cuban ports.

Fast Destroyers Rushed to Sea
on "Tip" Received at New
port. DANIELS EXPLAINS ORDER
Many Reports of Secret Sources
of Supply Received by the
Navy.
Suspicion that a belligerent gov
ernment might be maintaining sub
marine bases and secret wireless
stations on the Atlantic coast of
this country, caused the sudden
dash to sea of destroyers from
Newport, Secretary Danfels said to
day. Admiral Mayo, commanding the
Atlantic fleet, ordered the ships out
yesterday. They will search tho .
coast as far as Eastport, .Me., near
the Canadian border, for possible
secret submarine bases or wireless
stations. '
'We have no reason to believe
any belligerent is maintaining a
base on this shore," Daniels said. .
"During the last year, however,
whenever there has ben a report
or even a possibility that a bel
ligerent was maintaining a subma
rine base on this side, we have seat
destroyers out to search for it."
MANY REPORTS OF BASES.
Since the arrival of the L-S3, Daniels
said, there have been many report,
particularly in newspapers, that some
belligerent was maintaining a naval
base here.
Daniels has recelvod letters. It was
admitted, suggesting such a possibility
Tho order for the sudden trip to sea,
though, was given by Admiral Mayo on
his own Initiative.
Tho suddenness of the departure of
the tJestrojers gave rise to reports that
the Newport naval men had been
"tipped" to the location of a naval base,
but tho Navy Department has no In
formation on this point.
It was ulso said that ngents of tho
Treasury. War, and Justice Depart
ments aro co-oporatlng In the search
to determine whether this country was
permitting a vvlolatlon of Its neutrality
by allowing the establishment of such
bases. The Treasury Department Li
walking through the Coast Guard
Service.
Bases Believed at Sea.
The possible baso or bases arc not be
lieved to be on land. Instead, accoidlng
to official tips hero, supplying may bo
dono by shipmasters from Canada, the
I'nlted States, and fipaln. whllo non
slnkahlc rafts, with oil barrels attached,
may ho floated; out to belligerent war
vessels. Tho tip hero Is that these sup
plies havo been sent to German subma
rines. One official guardedly admitted hl.i
belief that there will be more submarine
raids next month.
Doubt U-53's Supplies.
Authorities do not believe that th
U-63 carried sufficient supplies to last
her for threo months as her captain
claimed,
Whllo officials would not soy p"'
tlvely that the process of supplying
submarines from ships along the coast
Is now proceeding, ono authority ppwe
unmistakable evidence that ho thinks
such reports come from what ho Navy
regards as reliable sources, and that
Ihev are worthy of the strlcest Inres
tlgalon. DESTROYERS' PATROL

NEWPORT, R. I., Oct. 13, Rushing
