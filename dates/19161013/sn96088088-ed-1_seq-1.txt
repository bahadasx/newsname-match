off for a day and took me about the
city. The most interesting place we
visited was Juarez. We. boarded
car bearing the name Mexico, but it
did not occur to me that this car
would take us through the city of
Juarez, as I did not suppose our
street care were operated in Mexico.
However, we came to the Internation
al bridge, and, after an inspection by
one American and two , Mexicans,
crossed the bridge and rode to the
principal business center of -Juarez.
The street oar line makes a wide
loop through the city and is the only
electric line that I saw. We entered
a sort ot curio store and bought
some postals to mail froni Mexico
and then walked around the town.
My friend had a camera and took
pictures, most of which were of Mexi"
can children in characteristic poes.
Poor little tilings, how they did heir
for a nickel! One picture was of un
eld man beggar sitting in a corner
of an old building, while another was
a laundry scene, in, which several wo
men were washing clothing in a dirty
irrigation ditch. The particular wo
man whom we wished to snap was!
scolding a child on one side of her
and slapping another on the other
side. The place beside the ditch where
the women were washing seemed to
be a sort of open air camping pkife
for the homeless, and the men sat
sleeping or smoking while the women
worked. It was a very depressing
place to me. In fatt I saw nothing in
Juarez which Interested, me in the
least. It seemed to me all life and
intelligence ceased the moment 'we
crossed the bridge. T saw only a few
Mexican soldiers there, 1'Ot more than
hnlf a dozen, and thuir appearance
bears out the description I have read
of them as being half starved,' etc.
My visit filled me with pity and dis
gust for the Mexican situation, and
I should like to say what I might
want to do were it in my power, to
settle the" problem. . Of course this
city may not be 4 fair representation
of the real Mexican cifV,. but it cer
tainly seemed a desolate, dirty and
wicked place to me. I did not see the
famous gambling den, although wt
must have passed it, nor did I wish
to visit the bull-fighting arena, I
had plenty just visiting the principal
parts of the town. We went through
the custom house and saw a historic
old church, and those are sufficient
memories for me. They aay Villa was
supposed to take Juarez on October
4, but we have not beard of t'lus be
ing done as yet. Really I don't be
lieve if I could see him attacking the
town I would be affected in the least,
and I can see a part of the city from
my place of residence, with the hills
of Meueo beyond, it is rather -a
pretty view.

Polk county cows, four bf which
were Jerseys entered by Frank Lough
ary and G. Q. Hewitt of Monmouth.
and one the prize winning. Holstein of
U. W. Jones, who lives on a ranch in
the north part of the county near
Amity, made a most creditable show
ing in the three days' milking con
test at the recent state fair.. Nine
cows were in the test which covered
six niillcings, beginning at 8 o'clock
Wednesday and dosing at 8 o'clock
Friday evening. The test as conduct"
ed by A. H. Steinmetz, deputy state
dairy and food inspector, assisted by
K. H'anneman, official tester for the
Marion county eow testing associa
tion.
Johanna de Kol, a Holstein of tjie
herd of H. W. Jones, a Polk county
farmer, took first prize in the test,
the value of her three days' milk pro
duction being $2.18279. Lady's Silk
en Glow, a Jersey owned by Pickard
Bros, of Marion .county was second,
with a production valued at $2.18230'
Jefferson's Lily, a Holstein owned by
William Bieliop, was third with pro
ducts valued! at $1.90, Octavia's Duch
ess, a Jersey . belonging to Frank
Loughary was fourth with products
valued at $1.78. La Belle's Girl, and
Lad 's Sweet Dorothy, two Jerseys of
O. G. Hewett, were fifth and sixth
respectively with records of $1.71
each. Riverview Cliloe Methilde and

Wm. Bishop, were seventh and eighth
respectively, with records of $1.48 and
$1.40. Eminent 'a Daisy, belonging
to Frank Loughary was ninth, with a
production amounting to $1.35.
It was necessary to carry the fig
ures out to long decimals on the first
two plaees, so close wag the compe
tition, "between- the Holstein. and. the
Jersey, the Jersey having had the lead
until the last milking. If she had
won this contest her owner would
have received $240 in premiums, there
being a $200 prize offered by the
American Jersey Cattle club for the
"Jersey eow that would win the con
test.
The average production of all Jer
seys and Holsteins in the eon test, was
aboot equal, the four best Jerseys
having a better average than the four
best Holsteins. The Jersey had the
.greater, production and lost the .eon
test through the ekinunilk .handicap
of the Holstein.
A two-day test on Jersey yearling
heifers entered by- Frank Longhary,
of Monmouth, Oregon, in the futurity
contest resulted as follows: Luckiat-

There just isn't ths water in ths

that there might be leaks I havs
personally" patrolled the lines and 1
find no leaks. The streams are low.
'There is no danger of an im

from a conflagration. Ths supply,
