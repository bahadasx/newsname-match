WASHINGTON, Oct 13.—Suspicion
that a belligerent government might
be maintaining a naval base on tbe
Atlantic coast of this country, caused
the BUdden dash to sea of destroyers
from Newport yesterday, Secretary
Daniels said today.
Admiral Mayo, commanding the
Atlantic fleet ordered the ship* out
yesterday. They will scour the coast
as far north as jQastport, Maine, near
tbe Canadian border, searching for
possible secret submarine bas«s or
Tireless stations.
"We have no reason to believe any
IciUigeretit is maintaining a base on
thli shore," Daniels saidC "Daring
the last year, however, whenever
there has been a report or even a
possibility that a belligerent was
maintaining a submarine base on this
side, we have sent destroyers out to
search for it"
Since the arrival of the 63, Dan
iels said there have been many re
ports, particularly in newspapers, that
tome belligerent was maintaining a
naval base here. Daniels has re
ceived letters, it was admitted, sug
gasting such a possibility. The order
for the' sudden trip to sea, though,
vas made by Admiral fifayo on his
own initiative. While the depart
ment has no information on this
point, the suddenness of the depart
ure of the destroyers gave rise to re
ports that the Newport naval men had
been "tipped" to tbe Ideation of a
naval base.
It was also said that agents of the
treasury and justice departments are
cooperating in the search. The Jus
tice department would be concerned
in discovering whether this country
vas permitting a violation of its neu
trality by allowing the establishment
of such bases.
Tbe treasury department is working
through the coast guard service.
The possible base or bases are not
relieved to be on land. Instead, ac
cording to official tips here, sopply
lng may be done by ship masters
from Canada, the United States and
Spain, while non-stateable rafts with
oil barrels attached, may be floated
oot to belligerent, war vessels. The
tip here Is that these supplies have

ON BOARD PRESIDENT WELr
SON'S TRAIN, AliTOONA, Pa., Oct
13.—(Feeling pleased over the recep
tion given him in Indiana yesterday,
President Wilson today Is swinging
along in his private train, enroute
back to Long Branch, N. J. The
democratic leaders still feel Indiana
is an uncertain quantity, bat that in
tbe two addresses the president made
yesterday, he carried home two
points:
1—That the president is contemptu
ous of such issues as sectionalism and
other contentions raised by his re
publican opponents and is determin
ed to carry on his campaign to make
his adversaries as he says, "put up
or shut up," on what he regards the
real lssnes.
2—For tihe first time he has ex
plained exhaustively to the fanners
of the country what tue democratic
congress has done for them by pass
ing thef rural credits bill, federal re
serve and other actq.
On latef points, lieutenants feet.
he now has this idea well be
fore the oountry. They feel one
big Issue upon which the cam
paign rests is whether or not the
people endorse the president's for
eign policy- They point to the en
thusiasm accorded his every utter
ance on peace yesterday as strong
evidence of approyal.
The president himself hinted in
one of his addresses that the "friend
ly look of people who lined the
streets" encouraged htm In the belief
that they believed in his expression
of the .national splfit. JTence they
feel Indiana will come into line on
the lgsne "peace with Wilson."
Tomorrow the president will "talk
turkey" to a big delegation of Penn
sylvania democrats who are going to
Shadow £aWn to hear him in the
third of his non-partisan speeches

in the charges. The department has
been informed, it is planned to take
voters from one state to another to
use them In elections. Charges made
to the department, it was admitted,
have been on excellent authority. In
many cases they were made by vot
ers' leagues and citlsens associations.
In some instances it is understood di
rect charges were made that certain
political organizations have planned
frauds In other eases that frauds of
the past years were to be repeated.
Election fraud cases in Denver,
•Colorado, Pennsylvania and West

cases. The Denver investigation has
to do with the Colorado Fuel and

RAYONN"EJ, N. J., Oct. 13.—Though
fearing Friday the thirteenth might
prove to be bloody Friday, police and
citlsens tried today to quell the oil
men's strike without calling the mili
tia.
The growing list of casualties Includ
ing another death reported today in
fearful riots, however, made It uncer
tain that this could be accomplished.
The strikers were in an ugly mood
today, while police and special depu
ties under fighting Dan Cady, six
foot police Inspector, were ready for
anything.
The police claimed Bo have better
control* than heretofore in view of
their Invasion of the strikers' terrltry
and their closing of saloons. But, de
spite* 4ead lines and gun play, the
territory actually controlled by strik
ers was a block broader today than
previously. Strikers, heavily armed,
patrolled this territory, prepared for
further lighting. Riots of the after
noon yesterday when a bystander was
killed and many injured, were not re
peated late at night, but the city
was nervous about the future.
Early today the body of an uniden
tified man, apparently a Slav—the
third person killed—was found at 84
West 19th street with a bullet wound
over the right eye. Investigation led
to the belief that the man was a
worker of the Oeneral Chemical com
pany who had tried to get strikers to
return to their labors for a bonus. A
saloonkeeper reported the man had
been In for a drink about midnight
that he heard a shot soon after that,
ten men ran away directly afterward.
Sheriff Eugene Klnkeade, the man
who ended a previous strike within
sight of New York, said today he
would keep hands off the strike unless
it got beyond control. Then, he said,
he would send in about two hundred
picked men for a clean up campaign:
The strikers have decreed death to
the police if they Invade the heart of
the strike section again. And, fight
ing Dan Cady says he'll disregard any
such ultimatum.
His cleanup of saloons in the strike
district, had somewhat of a quieting
effect JSis squad battered down
doors, destroyed bottles and turned
on the spigots.
Police early today drove off strik
ers approaching the Tidewater Oil
company's plant and a Standard Oil
building. There were several arrests
over night for looting and minor dis
turbances.
The authorities planned a raid
through the strike zone today in an
effort to round up arms hidden in the
laborers' homee.

[By Henry Wood, United Press Staff

WITH THE FRENCH ABMIES ON
TBE SOCM'ME FRONT, Oct. IS.—1The
Germans have withdrawn their heavy
guns from one and a half to five
miles behind their Somme front, An
glo-French aviators have discovered
on recent flights.
The withdrawal was ordered to
save the pieces from capture. In the
recent dashes of allied infantry into
the German lines, many heavy guns
have been taken before the Germans
had an opportunity to withdraw them.
The Germans now h&ve 2,100/ guns
opposing the French and British on
the thirty mile Somme front, com
pared with the 2,800 guns they used
in the attack on Verdun. Of this
number 600 are south of the Somme,
facing the French, and 050 oppose
the French advance north of the
Somme. The British are opposed by
850 German pieces.
Since the. allied offensive began,
more than 500 German guns have
been captured.
Italian Drive Failed.
BBRSLiN, Oct. 13—The Italian drive
on the Isonzo launched for the pur

on Rumania, has utterly failed in its
1
purpose, said Vienna dispatches to
day.
The Austrians have blocked re

Cadorna has failed to make any Im

munition lavishly in eight days of

Republican Candidate for

Me" State.
(OVATION AT LOUISVILLE
Kentucky City Turned Out and Gave
Him Whole-Souled Re

Night.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
ST. LOUIS. Mo, Oct IS.—On what
President Wilson considers his lucky
day—Friday the thirteenth—Republi
can Candidate Hughes swung into
democratic Missouri today, confident
of m^fcfag enongh votes to carry the
"show me" state in November. Wes*
era republican managers have ex
pressed great confidence at tie
chance for -heir ticket carrying In
the state and Hughes, himself,
planned two red hot speeches In
Springfield late this afternoon and at
Joplln tonight to carry convincingly
the doctrines of republicanism.
From now on Hughes plans freely
to discuss what he would have done
were he president. The meeting In
Louisville last night 'took the lid
off" the question of the submarine
issue. It forced Hughes' hand to a
certain extent. He had planned to
await until It was certain that the
U-58 and the question of bringing
submarine warfare to American
shores had been disposed of before
striking oat on the question of how
he would have handled the subma
rine matter. But his speech at Louis
ville last night forced an earlier an
swer to the question. Members of
his immediate party today were Jubi
liant over the reception which Louis
ville accorded his answer. The can-*
didate has encountered very few
orowds on all his campaign trips
which accordod him such a whole
souled reception as that at the Ken
tucky city last night. It Was a crowd
which appreciated the fact that al
though "heckled" the republican
nominee struck back stronger than
the hit which his questioner aimed
at him.
Police were powerless 16 handle
the crowd and there were numerous
comments among Kentucky republi
cans that the democratic administra
tion of Louisville provided only, two
policemen absolutely hopeless
against the rjtob which jammed the
hall—to afford protection to the gov
ernor and Mrs. Hughes. Mrs. Hughes
got lost from her husband in' the mob
and those with her had literally to
fight their way to the platform, shield
ing her as much as possible from the
enormous crowd.
HugheB toduy hoped to sleze the
opportunity offered by plenty of
time between speeches to rest. Yes
terday's program In Kentucky greatly
fagged the former justice. At the
Loulsvlle meeting this fatigue was
apparent Is his voice and his physician
ordered a slow program on the train,
conferences and the like, particularly
In view of the fact that tomorrow in
Nebraska, Hughes faces a program of
half a doscn talks.
Hughes is beginning to find out
that a candidate not only has to talk
and travel, but must sign hundreds
of autographs, must acknowledge hun
dreds of small gifts, ranging from
flowers to Indian relics and must take
particular interest in babies named
after him. So far on the trip, he has
received notice of two such Infants
who will go through life named
Cnarles Hughes Something or Other.
