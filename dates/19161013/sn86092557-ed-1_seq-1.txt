Respoiu
I Governor Hatfldd made the first ot
a series of three speeches scheduled
A tor Marlon county last night at Farnington,
and to use the miners' term,
shot his administration's critics and
.Watson's gubernatorial candidate
"off the solid." Incidentally, he spoke
to the largest audience that ever assembled
In a hall In Farmington to
bear a political address. Fire hundred
heard him and a hundred and fifty
were turned away disappointed, uni
ible to get Into the hall.
A party ot forty-three prominent
Republicans accompanied the Gover>,,/
aor from here to bear him. The Oorernor
was introduced to the audience
by Hon. W. E. Meredith who presided
at the meeting, after Gilbert Morgan,
|S\ , Republican committeeman from Far[
Vv Qington, bad called the assemblage
i to order.
Tonight Governor Hatfield will
Bpeak at both Monongah and Worthington,
and the local Republican club
will accompany him this evening taking
along the Plerpont Post Drum
Corps who will provide the music. The
Monongah meeting Is to be held at
mm o'clock In the Lvrlc theatre and
the Worthington meeting will begin
at 8:30. the local party going from
Mcmongah to Worthington. W. H.
Veach, Rollo J. Conley, W. S. Hamuli
ton. Brooks Hutchinson, J. A. More41th,
W. S, Meredith and other promiX/
-mot Marlon county Republicans will
V: attend the meetings tonight and may
Sj give short talks.
i--,. The Governor's speech last night
j was a review or his administration,
which by the nature of the text, was
a complete refutation ot the baseless
charges and reckless statements made
s." by Candidate Cornwell It was a speech
$ full of punches and every punch fol'
lowed cheers. It was characteristically
a Hatfield speech, which met fair'ly
every criticism of his Democratic
J enemies, with a broadside of facts and
figures.
"Every pledge made in our platrorm
of 1912." declared Governor Hatfield
m at one point, "has been faithfully fulfilled.
Every pledge made to the voters
who elected us to perform them,
may be found written into the laws
of our state. N'ot a single pledge made
" has failed to be kept."
"And you kept 'unbossed. unbought
and unafraid.' too. Governor," shouted
: , a voice back In the crowded hall. The
audience fairly roared.
Replying to Cornwell's charge that
.. under Hatfield $1,280,000 more had
t been expended than under his press;;
decessor, Governor Hatfield said he
could not expend a dollar that the Legislature
had not appropriated, and that
4 the Legislature of 1913 was equally
g divided as to the Senate, and that a
r Democrat, S. V. Woods, was Presi
uoiib vi iuai uuui iiiciii anu liiui it
there was any extravagance, it was
& flfty-flfty division between the par&
- ties.
Taking that point up In detail the
Governor said:
"One million two hundred and eighty
thousand dollars was appropriated by
the Legislature In 1913 for the purpose
of relieving the crowded condition
of the state Institutions; if that
\ was extravagant expenditure, as Mr.
Cornwall and the Democratic press
.would have the people believe, it was
^approved by fifteen Democratic stato
senators with a Democratic senator
presiding in the person of the Honorable
Samuel V. Woods.
. f "The pensions paid out in August
h. .Of this year were $32,493.39. and In
[September $35.236.S4 in pensiou Indemtaltles
were paid.
1- "Mr. Cornwell misrepresented me in
*1 no many of this statements that I felt
SV' lit was due the public that I challenge
plm for a Joint debate, giving bim an
opportunity to prove to the people the
\ truthfulness of his assertions. It waB
any earnest desire to have him ac
eept this challenge because I wanted

notwithstanding this our direct levy

"It this be true I would like to a

effect in July. 1914.
"I would also further ask Mr. Cornwell

81IIIE TIMES
Cuts of Requisitions Prove
Hatfield Was Everiast'
ingly Right.
Marlon county voters were handed
l laugh or an insult, depending upon
low they take such things, in the pubIcatlon
on the first page of the local
Democratic organ or fac stmilies of
wo requisitions drawn by Governor
iatfield upon tbe state auditor.
To make the situation clear it is
leceKsarjr .to recount,s little- of-tbtilstory
which has been made In the
>resent campaign. Sodh after he took
he stump the Democratic candidate
or governor, who has developed an
imazlng perchant for the contemptilie
In politics, made a charge that
lovernor Hatfield had used tbe public
unds for the payment of detectives.
The charge was made in such words
ind under such circumstances as to
reate the impression that the Govirnor
had been using money belongng
to the taxpayers for purposes of
its own and that one of those purposes
vas to make private investigations
luring the recent primary campaign.
Governor lintfleld when this preposerous
statement was called to his atention
said simply that "Not one dotar
of the money from the contingent
und has been used for the payment
if defective^ by me."
The two requisitions printed this
norning purport to be complete proof
hat the Cornwell charge was well
ouaded and that the Hatfleld dislaimer
was an untruth.
It may deceive some people, but for
he man who Is ordinarily intelligent
he requisitions really amount lo proographic
proof that the Governor was
entirely right. It is safe to assure
hat If the Democrats had anything
nore damaging against the Governor
hey would have used it. What tliey
lid use indicates that the payments
vere not oflly entirely proper expendture
of public money iu the course of
nn punuc s nusiness. hut were nut
ivon for detective work.
One of them, that for $1,957 payaile
to Guy B. Blddlnger. was for witless
fees, proper court costs. In the
amous legislative bribery cases which
vero started during the ndministraion
of Governor Glasscock and they
cere paid upon the order of Judge
V. H. O'Brien, of the United States
tistrlct court, a Democratic judge, by
ho way. The other one. for $4,000
fas payable to Tom Townsend, who
,t the time was prosecuting attorney
or Kanawha county, and the money
vas used to pay the expenses of ap
nvestlgation Into the Wheel case
vhich grew out of an alleged attempt
o bribe members of the Public Servce
commission.
One of these requisitions was drawn
hree years ago and the other almost
wo years ago. The public is fully aclualnted
witb the circumstance*
vhlch made those expenditures necesary
yet a man who seeks the office
if governor asks the West Virginia
titers to believe that the requisitions
irove that Hatlleld has been playing
lolitlcs with the people's money. Cornveil
has a pretty poor opinion of their
ntelllgence apparently.

Bootleggers'Know That, One
of Them Told Him
So.
Rollo J. Conlcv. Republican candidate
for prosecuting attorney, is now in the
midst of his campaign for the fall
election and in addition to meeting the
voters of the county personally ho Is
appearing with other of the local canj
didatcs in the schoolhousc meetings
; which arc being held in every district
j in the county.
He spoke last night at Bunner's
Ilidge where more than seventy-five
j voters gathered to hear Mr. Conlcy.
. J. A. Meredith. Brooks Hutchinson and
| W. S. Hamilton. Mr. Meredith delivered
the principle address and each
of the candidates gave short talks.
t'onley leaves the impression from
happy mood he is In tha,t he is meeting
with success. He is conducting
a clean campaign, ho positively refuses
to say a word about the man who
is responsible for inexpressible conditions
now prevalent in Fairmont. He
tells his audience that fie is seeking
office as prosecuting attorney and
states that he will enforce the laws
according to the statutes. He will do
what he says should he be elected,
for his pnst history shows him an
honest, conscientious hard working
man of his word.
Mr. Coniey is an attorney in very
high standard in this county but many
years of hard work were needed to
thus place himself. He did not start
to study law until 32 years of age.
Ho is now 42. Prior to studying
law he w?4 a railway mail clerk at
$1,000 a year. On this salary he mar-'
rled and saved. While .his son was
attending the grammar schools he himself
was going to college to study
law.
To further prove his fighting spirit
and his love for his county Mr. Coniey
upon the Second call for volunteers
during the Spanish-American war became
a soldier of the United States
and spent one year In the Philippine
Islands. Later, when the United States
government ordered battleships to
Vera Cruz and the outlook for war
with Mexico was very probable he
joined tbe National Guard and stood
ready to answer the first call for his
services.

Tends to Prove That Wilson
Was Bidding for the
German Vote.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
NEW YORK. Oct. 12.?General
Charles H. Sherrlll. who was grand
marshal of the New York city preparedness
parade of last spring, issued
a statement at Republican National
headquarters today charging
that the Washington administration
endeavored for political reasons to
prevent that parade. This effort having
failed subsequently it will be remembered,
President Wilson himself
took part in a preparedness parade
In Washington.
Mr. SherriU's statement says: "Mr.
Rldder's statement in the newspapers
that the administration has for some
time been attempting to conciliate
what they frequently call the German:
hyphenate vote recalls to my mind an
' experience of last spring which tends
, to confirm hlB statement. At that time
; for six weeks I with some 'of my
I friends was engaged in organizing the
| preparedness parade which took place
I in this city on May 13. About two
| weeks before that date I received an
; urgent telephone request to come to
1 the mayor's ofBce. Upon arrival there
I wag told that a long dtstance teleph'uuB1
message had Just hcen received
from the administration In Washington
urging that the preparedness
parade be abandoned on the ground
that It would irritate our American citizens
of German birth or descent,
might cause riots in the street and
therefore be moBt undesirable. Of
course I was aBtuonded by this request
and stated tbat in my opinion
sidestepping a crisis was not the best
way to meet it, especially if not assured
that It really was a crisis. I
ashed time to consider the matter and
it was given me. It was made clear
lhat the extraordinary suggestion did
not originate with the mayor hut came
from the administration In Washington.

a real or only an imaginary crisis, prepared
