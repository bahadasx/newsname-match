(Continued on page 5)
llefore a largo audience of repre
sentative men and women In the, city
ball Tuesday night, Hon. Charles W.
Kulton, former Culled States senator
of Oregon, delivered a iiiaterrul
speech on the political Ii.hiich of the
day. Time and time again ho was
Interrupted by applause, which
showed the audience was heartily In
accord with the truths he expounded.
In opening bis address, Senator
Fulton paid his ruspects to those who
d I (Tercel from him politically. Ho
said: "Each mun has a right to be
lieve a.i ho wants, but I am here to
tell you why 1 am a republican and
also to point out some of the mis
takes of thu democratic administra
tion." Mr. I'ullou made ihreo specific
cliurr.es against the present adminis
tration Incompetence, extravagance
and disloyalty; ami, reading from the
democratic platform, he quoted that
portion of It which denounced the
extruvaganco of previous administra
tions and promised economy In the
administration of federal affairs, the
abolishment of useless offces and a
roturn to democratic simplicity. As
to tho abolishment of useless offices,
the speaker pointed out that under
Wilson's administration 30,000 new
offices had been created for the "pork
hunters," ut a cost of $40,000,000
per year; and a sample of demo
cratic economy was that, excluding
the naval and army appropriations
and tho cost of tho present schedule
of preparedness, the cost of running
the government wus $M5,000,000
per yenr more than when the repub
licans wore In power.
Iu speaking of the I'nderwood free
trado law, Mr. Fulton stated Hint at
I he time of the passage of this law
the trade balance was in favor of
the United Status, hut in ten months
after Us passage the balance was ro-
duccd from $600,000,000 to $3.10.-
000.000, showing conclusively that
with tho tariff cut off the markets of
the Cnlted Slates were flooded with
foreign goods. During thoso ten
months, tho speaker said, "tho Urea
of tho factory furnaces were ex
tinguished und the wheels ceased to
turn" and "three million of Amer
ican workmen were out of employ
ment." This wus the ten months
period before the war the war that 2.
has brought tho prosperity to the!-!-
country, credit for which prosperity j
the democrats claim. He said Hie
republican pnrty did not wish to
bring prosperity to mo couimj
such proiiperity has to come hy ttio

such prosperity conies with the tears
and anguish of iho widows and the
sorrow of the mothers whoso sons

boomugo. The main line is 25 miles
In length, with 60-pound stoel. The
country between Kerry and the
terminus Is exceedingly
rough, cuts and fills fol
lowing in quick succes
sion. A grade of 2
per cent favorable to
tho loud obtains on tho
Columbia river side of tbs
iummit, witli a maximum
adverse grado of 1 V4
per cent leading to the
bummit.
An. ng tho difficulties
encountered in the build
ing of the line was the
driving of an 1800-foot
tunnel ut the summit. A
vein of quicksand gave a
great deal of trouble and
unforeseen expense, hut
aflc; a delay of nearly a
year the boro was com
pleted and Is giving no fur
ther difficulty. The tun
nel is said to be the long
est logging railroad tunnel
in the west. Eight loco
motives are used on the
line.
Seven camps are served
by the Columbia & Nolin
lem, having a combined
dally capacity of nearly
one million feot.
The greater portion of
the timber tapped by th
road is Douglas fir, with
about 10 per cent cedar
cut by tho canips west of
tho tunnel. Mr. Kerry
estimates that without fur
ther extension, 8,000,000,-
000 feet of timber can be
removed by the line. This
nowover, ts by no means
the limit of the amount
that can be reached by the
road.
The line is doing a good
passenger business as well
as freight business, having
four gasolino cars which
Mr. Kerry terms "jitneys,"
doubtless because the fare
is 5 cents per mile. These
gasoline cars are automo
biles adapted to railroad
traffic, using steel flanged
wheels. Tho jitneys serve
tho passenger needs very
nicely. Besides tho travel
front the seven canips, the
line taps a very old settle
ment having a considerable
population.

and that a reasonable tariff was neces
sary to protect the American Indus
tries and the American workmen.
Mr. Fulton Bcored tho administra
tion's Mexican policy. He cited the
fact that Mr. Wilson thought Hnorta

ico, so ho would not rocognlze him
as the bend of tho government, but

rines lunded at Vera Cm and wero

Wilson cnllod for on apology from

Wilson was concerned, Huerta was

Mr. Huerta apologized, and although
Wilson nnd Jo-BO-phus Daniels sent
tho American fleet to Mexico to have
the flag saluted, the fleet stonmod

refugees In Moxlco "and with the flag

the long nnd honorable career of the
republican candldato and predicted
Hint tho people of tho nation will
turn to him as tho man to lead lliem
out of tho wilderness of democratic
entanglements.
A pleasing incident of tho evening
occurred just as Mr. Fulton finished
his speech. Tom U'utts, who occu
pied a seat on tho stago, came for
word nnd suggested three cheers for
"Fulton, Hughes and the Grand Old
Party," nnd the enthusiastic manner
in which the cheers rang out was
satisfactory ovldenco that tho audi
ence agreed with tho speaker on bis
views and believed that Hughes nnd
tho principles nnd the party he repre
sents are tho best for the whole country.

PRESCOTT WILL AT
LAST HAVE ROAD
Trestle to Be Built Connecting Sta
tion With Main Highway.
After a year of isolation, so far as
roads go, Prescott will soon have a
road so its citizens may come and
go without having to rely entirely on
the trains or walking the railroad
track. The county court has award
ed a contract to T. J. Fllppin to build
a trestle from the Prescott station
across the lowlands and connect with
tho main highway about one-half
mile south of Little Jack Falls. The
contract price is $4,500, and work
will be started during the coming
week nnd probably completed before
the first of the year.
By the terms of tho contract, Mr.
Fllppin will wait for his money until
the taxes begin to come in next
spring, so the district (No. 4) will
riot be spending money that has al
ready been appropriated for other
purposes. The proposed improvement
is one that will be appreciated by the
Prescott people and the public at
largo. More than 100 people live in
Prescott and they were certainly en
titled to a road. Tho Mist is glad
they will have it.
