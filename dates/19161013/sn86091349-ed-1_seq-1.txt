RECORD
Republican
Hold Rally At Calf ente
(Special to the Record)
CALIENTE. Nev.. Oct. 12 The
Republican candidates, who have
been making a whirlwind campaign
In the western and southern part9
of the state during the past two
week, were accorded a hearty and
rousing reception here tonight. In
the party were Sam Piatt, nominee
for United States senator; Ed. E.
Roberts, nominee for representative
In congress; Judge "Barney" Moran.
nominee for Justice of the supreme
court; and It. A. McKay, nominee
for clerk of the supreme court. The
speaking was held at Electric Movie
hall, which was filled to overflowing
with an enthusiastic audience. Tl;e
speakers were in fine trim and were
frequently Interrupted by outbursts
of applause.
In the course of his remarks Sam
Piatt declared the issue was not so
much a choice between parties as a
decision as to what best represents
the American idea. "I am a Republi
can ail the time, but first of all an
American" is the slogan of the can
didate for the United States senate,
as he explains that "All citizens, na
tive and naturalized, are equal under
the flag's protection and any admin
istration that falls to confer that
Iprotectlon is not worth the name of
American."
"The Adamson eight hour act,"
was remarkable legislation as a
temporary emergency expedient,
but it was forced from the
Democracy and does not represent
friendship to labor so much as an ef
fort of the party to get out of trouble
and to stay in power. ' I am for per
manent and decisive legislative re
lief for labor that will guarantee all
just demands of the workingman.
If Democracy had labor's interest
at heart why did the party wait for
a strike to force congress to act and
why did they not extend the eight
hour day to every workingman en
gaged In interstate commerce? I re
joice that the brothehood men have
through legislation secured even a
little that they deserve but, I regret,
that labor generally was not remem
bered. That is a sample of Wilson
logic. He declares his good inten
tions but he never moves until his
hand is forced. A true friend of
labor would have given to all labor
the eight hour day without the ask
ing." Pittman Land Bill
Piatt explained the Pittman land
bill which, he said, would be dis
astrous to the state and a law which
he would fight if he were permit
ted to go to the senate. To segre
gate7.000,000 acres from the pub
lic domain Implied that Federal aid
could never be secured for these
acres, There would be no reclama
tion or building of reservoirs, no
exploration of the underflow or de
velopment of artesian wells, for the
government never engages in. im
provements where It does not own
the land.
"The selection of these 7.000,000
acres does not give the poor man a
chance" continued Mr. Piatt. "The
land must be sold at auction for
not less than $1.25 an acre. The
poor man now can go out on the
public domain and get all the land
he wants by paying the entry fee of
ten cents per acre. Why then, should
the settler be asked to pay $1.25 an
acre, or more, through competition
with the rich man? If the land la
worth more than $1.25 an acre the
poor man Is shut out. If the lanl
not worth $1.25 an acre the poor
man does not want.it at any price.
The school benefit fund is merely
a blind and suterfuge. Furthermore,
Pittman proposes to have 62,000,
000 acres of Federal lands unloaded
on Nevada without prospect of ev
er doing anything to make these
lands valuable through gigantic rec
lamation projects in which the gpv
ernment alone is. powerful enough
to engage.
Roberts Right at Home
Congress E. E. Roberts is at home
on the subject of protection and
in this campaign he Is dwelling on
the danger that menaces the farm
er and stockman through inroads of
the dressed beef industry from Ar
gentlna and wheat and grain from
Argentina and Manchuria where
Candidates
land may be had at one dollar an
acre. He cited the development that
has been going on in Japan during
the past two years and declared that
nation would flood this country with
manufactured products unless there
was relief in the form of a tariff for
something more than revenue. .Un
less a high tariff law was reenact
ed to stem the inrush, the United
States will be the dumping ground
of the universe. There could be no
doubt of that since it is a well known
fact that the war stricken countries
have been developing an intense pro
ductive capacity during the time
they have been shut out from the
world's competition. This means
they will be prepared to send out
their manufactured products at less
than cost and the buyer in sight is
Uncle Sam unless the bars of pro
tection are raised the flood of cheap
stuff will pour in and the nation will
lose all It has won through coddling
the war babies.
Mr. Roberts also spoke of the mis
erable mail service and the necessity
for a change In the management
which seeks to make money out of
the public. This is the only depart
ment of the government that lab
ors to extort a profit from the peo
ple. This is done by extending par
eels post service and restricting first
class mail. The department at pres
ent conducted Is operated In the In
terest of the mail order house and
In direct opposition to the small mer
chant and even the consumer.
Judge Barney Moran hag been In
his element all week mingling with
old friends and revisiting scenes that
were familiar to him thirty years
ago wen he was a boy operator In
old Esmeralda county. Down In
Clark county, and here he has been
getting acquainted and winning new
friends.
R. A. McKay, candidate for clerk
of the supreme court, surprised the
meeting by declaring he was a prac
tising attorney although known In
Nevada chiefly as clerk in the state
engineer's office. Mr, McKay was
counsel for the labor organizations
of Bay City, Mich., during the long
period of troublous events In which
he succeeded in carrying through
every measure required by the un
ions and also in winning every case
brought in the courts either on the
ground of injunction or by the im
portation of strikebreakers.
The candidates will leave here in
the morning for Panaca where a
meeting will be held about the noon
hour. Tomorrow night they will be
in Ploche, which will wind up their
campaign in Lincoln county.

.
Poitical Pointers
Jim Nesbitt is the first of the
county candidates to start on his
campaign tour of the county. He
fleft for Eaglet Spring and, Camp
valleys, returning to town last Tues
day. He expressed himself as be
ing well pleased with the trip and Is
figuring on getting a good vote in
(the northern precincts.
W. B. Harris, Republican nominee
for county clerk, was at Atlanta a
day or two ago. He declared that
he went on a hunting trip and did
not talk politics to anyone.
Chas. Culverwell, Democratic nom
inee for county treasurer, does not
expect to get out on his campaign
until after the delivery of the elec
tion supplies to Sheriff Ronnow.
The ballots will be printed by the
Record and will be turned over to
Mr. Culverwell in a few days some
time next week.
Many people are heard to remark
that this has been the quietest cam
paign ever witnessed in Lincoln
county. Few of the candidates have
been around and there are less cam
paign cards than usual. However,
the election is over three weeks off
and there Is plenty of time yet.
LAS VEGAS GAMBLERS
GET SUSPENDED SENTENCE
Public opinion In the county not
being sufficiently strong to demand
an uncompromising enforcement of
the law and the actual Imprisonment
of the offenders, Lon Groesbeck of
the Northern hotel, convicted of il
legal gambling on Saturday, and six
other gamblers who, upon Croes
beck's conviction, hastened to plead
guilty, were given suspended sen
tences from one to five years In
the state prison by District Judge
Chas. Lee Horsey In district court
Tuesday afternoon.
While people of the city who be
lieve in strict enforcement of tlie
law as an example to "free and easy"
living, realized that public opinion
in the county compelled the suspen
sion of the sentence in the case of the
convicted gamblers, yet the victory
of the law in securing the convic
tion of Groesbeck by a Jury of 12 of
his fellow citizens was felt to be a
long step out of the tendency to
lawlessness In Nevada.
District Judge Horsey's arraign
ment of gamblers and gambling be
fore he pronounced sentence Tues
day afternoon was a powerful ex
pression of his own opinion inline
matter, although he realized that
public opinion In the county was
against sending the guilty men to
Carson City. District Attorney Hen
derson also was under the weight
of public opinion to such an extent
that he was unable to object to the
plea for suspended sentences. He
was content with the splendid vic
tory his ability and steadfastness had
attained in winning a verdict of
guilty in the case of the seven gamb
lers, one of whom was convicted
after a seven-day trial and the other
six of whom pleaded guilty.
Henderson's handling of the cases
was commented upon by many who
followed the course of the trial. Few
people were willing to admit that
Groesbeck could be convicted, and It
was only as Henderson built up his
case day by day by fearless attacks
concluded by one of the strongest
final pleas ever made to va Jury In
this city that it was seen that a ver
dict of guilty would be the result.
The conviction of the seven gamb
lers takes all rights as citizens from
them. They will be unable to vote
at the November election for Presi
dent or any other, election during
the time of their suspended sen
tences of from one to five years, ac
cording to the discretion of the
judge. In addition, they will be un
able to hold any public offices. The
first result of this was the resigna
tion of O. D. Hicks from the office of
city commissioner this week.
The seven men are: Lon Groes
beck, of the Northern hotel; Ed.
Van, of the OO saloon; Carl Wasser-
bach; Merrltt Pollard, of the Over
land hotel saloon; Fred J. Pearce,
of Las Vegas hotel; and Joe Naka-
gawa.
On Tuesday afternoon before the
court pronounced judgement on
Groesbeck, Richard Busteed, as at
torney for the convicted man, intro
duced a motion for a new trial on
eight grounds and also asked for a
stay of Judgement for a few days.
Judge Horsey refused both requests
and pronounced judgement after ar
raigning the gambling business.
The sentences were suspended
with the provision that they should
go Into effect at once upon the vio
lation of any law of the state" of Ne
vada, and particularly the gambling
law Clirk County Review.
The friends of Judge Breeze will
be pained to learn that the state of
his health la precarious. A telegram
was sent to his son, C. D. Breeze at
Las Vegas, summoning him to his
father's- bedside. He arrived here
yesterday morning.

ANNIE MARTIN HERE TO

ty in the present campaign.

es for Nevada women in 1914, was
introduced by Mrs. Alex. Orr, who
was chairman of Lincoln county
in the suffrage campaign.
Miss Martin stated that the Wom
an's party was absolutely non-partisan;
that It Is working forno party
and no candidates; but was abso
lutely opposed to President Wilson
and the Democratic candidates for
senate and house" in the national
congress because of their opposition
of the national suffrage amendment.
She said that President Wilson's
plank In the national Democratic
platform, supported by Senator Pitt
man at St. Louis, recommending the
extension of snfPracro k n,
only Is a virtual denial of suffrage, I
as that more than twenty state con
stitutions are practically Impossible

was taking no part in the state elec-
itons, and urged the women voters
to vote against President Wilson, j
