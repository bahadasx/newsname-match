THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
There is but little of special signifi
cance to report this week. The Rus
sians are still lighting as they have been
to make progress towards Lemberg and
while they claim some progress they are
being stubbornly resisted by the Ger
man-Austrians.
The fighting about Roumania has
mixed results. The Roumanian army
which over-ran Transylvania at the be
ginning has been forced back to the
boundary passes again. The entente
Salonika armies that set out from there,
have made considerable advances but
nothing of a decisive nature. The Serbs
also report successes.
The British and French report small
advance? along the Stromal
The event of the week was the appear
ance of a German submarine off the
coast of the United States near New
York and the sinking of five or six mer
chant vessels. We treat of this in the
editorials in this issue.
THE "U-»3."
The Germans while a cheerful people
are not usually thought of as being ad
dieted to practical joking, but in' this
world war tfcey have certainly kept Sir
John Bull bothered good deal with
their almost startling novelties in war
fare. They have kept the great British
navy "swatting flies" ever since the war
began. The sudden arrival and success
ful sailing of the "Dmtschlard" sub
marine merchantman wa& one of these
Saturday another subaaarine "U S3"
came quietly into Hasopton Roads, re
mained a few hours, sailed away and
next day sunk five or six ships right As
front «f!New York harbor. We speak
of these as jokes, but they
aregriuj
jokes, with a oertain kind of humor, but
not 4he sort that brings a laugh, for «U
humor is not laughable.
That the act of the
UU
63" was a«ew
and surprising development of sub
marsine warfare and struck a blowdn a
new and unexpected quarter is the jwin
oipal part ol the mid from a Genman
aad -British standpoint. What it means
to neutral America is another question.
i&xcept that the submarine has the
power to submerge, and thereby conceal
herself from British cruisers, her acts
were no more than might have occurred
if aiy other German armed ship had
appeared off the same port and perform
ed the same acts.
£ut that performance amounts to a
jgprtial blockade a busy American
foru Nine tenths of the shipping sail
ing in and out of .American ports is for
eign most of the cargoes are consigned
to beligerent nations. While all the
•ships torpedoed were sunk outside of
the "three mile limit" yet for all .practi
cal, purposes they might as well Jiave
been sunk in .New York harbor itself.
Uncle Sam will certainly not enjoy such
a blockade, though it-is difficult at this
time to see how he«an help himself un
der .the present international rules.
However, like the adventurous "Deut
-Bchland"
this may be only a single .per
Jormance. Certainly it cannot be very
.largely extended or repeated for .many
reasons Germany has too few «ub
marines, and Britain has too many war
.ships. .Such raids .may happen sgain
and at other unexpected points, but like
the rest of the Germain raiders it is
only a.question of time and opportunity
when their careers are stopped.
The .history of this war is that sub
marines as war weapons are very liule
use so lar. The theory that they v. ould
be able to light and sink any war sh^p
has not been proven.. In fact the Brit
ish navy has been able to keep the Brit
ish Island waters comparatively free
though the submarines had only short
distances to sally out from the home
bases. The submarine evidently fears
the cruiser and destroyer.
The submarine is built to run away
and not for a stand-up fighter. It can
prey on unarmed ships but as a warrior
so far it has cut but little figure.
There is one circumstance in Satur
day's work that is worth noting. The
six ships sunk were all done for in one
afternoon or day, but it kept the sub
marine busy all that time in disposing of
the vessels. Doubtless many more ships
were sighted in that busy sea lane but
she had no time to stop any others.
Then she disappeared. Why did she
not remain and continue her work?
Now, in the English and Irish chan
nels ships are as plenty as off New York
harbor, but there has never been any
such a number of ships sunk at one
time or one place about the British
Isles. W,hy?
There will be no general blockade of
the ports of the United States by sub
marines, though the possibility has and
will set the world agog for ft week or
two, until our German jokers start some
thing else.
There is no one questioning the hon
esty of purpose of President Wilson
There are very many people who ques
tion his good judgement. If President
Wilqon's term of office had occurred in
less strenuous times his schoolmaster
experience might have dealt with local
issues, with success, but the vacillations
of his mind during the questions arising
from the Mexican and the European
war are patent to everyone. Lincoln
and McKinley rose to their occasions
under similar circumstances, but Mr.
Wilson has proven a weakling when
strength was needed.
Worms Sap your
Child's Strength
Is your child pale and fretful? Does
he cry out in sleep or grind his teeth?
These symptoms may mean worms and
you should obtain relief at once. Kicka
poo Worm Killer is a pleasant, remedy
that kills the worm, and by its mildly
laxative quality expels it from the sys
tem. Worms sap the vitality and make
your child more susceptible to other
ailments. Your druggist sells Kiekapoo
Worm Kilier, 25c a box.
That famous German submarine, mer
chant ship "Bremen" has apparently
turned into a "ghost ship" and •hotitd
be rechTistened as the "Flying Dutch
man." Almost every day. some entir
prising reporter sees or hears of her—
somewhere—but as yet she appeara-ftb
remain—nowhere. We sometimes wOi
der if the "Bremen" was not a huge
jobs perpetrated by the captain of the
"Oeutchland" just to keep the British
navy busy.

Stop the f*irst Cold
A cold does not get well of itself. The
process of wearing out a cold wears you
out, and your cough becomes serious if
neglected. Hacking coughs drain the
energy and sap the vitality. For 47
years the happy combination of sooth
ing antiseptic bslsams in Dr. King's
New Discovery has healed coughs and
relieved congestion. Young and old can
testify to the effectiveness of Dr. King's
New Discovery for coughs and colds.
