Assertion By Count Westarp at
Opening of Reichstag
SOCIALISTS OPPOSE PLAN
England's Cry of War to the Bitter
End Precludes Peace Now De-"""
sired by All Nations.
Merlin, via London, Oct. 12. Count
Westarp, leader of the Conservative
paity, repuliated in a speech at the
opening of the Reichstag yesterday
the idea that Germany will restore He!
giuni and the conquered French terri
tory to their former owners. Ger
many will keep all her conquered ter
ritory, he said, answering llerr Schei
demann, the Socialist leader.
"No," the Conservative leader said,
"what we conquered at the cost of our
blood we will hold as Ions as neces
sary in order to assuer the future of
tthe German nation."
Herr Scheidemann said: "Shanees
lor peace today are poor. Since ltriand
and Lloyd George have preached war
until the bitter end, the Chancellor is
unable to talk peace. Due we are free
to do so. The nations want peace. If
the contrary be said in any country,
then it is absolutely untrue.
"The French nation is kept ignorant
by censorial prohibition of the fact
that It could see its country, as well
as Belgium, free today of German
troops without shedding one more
drop of blood and without losing one
more square foot of soil. What do
these nations still fight for? That the
French shall stay in Farnce. that ttie
Belgians shall stay in elilgium, that
the Germans shall stay in Germany.
Tills is the main basis upon which the
coming eace will be constructed."
It is practically certain the 'Keich
stag will not discuss the submarine
question during the session. The
budget committee, by a vote of 24 to 4,
has declared against the discussion.
-Major Krnest Bassermann, leader of
the National Liberal party, al'tersaying
that the budget committee, for which
he spoke, had considered thoroughly
and "under the impression of the high
importance of the question "its every
aspect," said:
"The committee recommends that
the Heichstag in its deliberations ab
stain from a discussion of submarine
warfare. It bases this attitude on the
standpoint that a thorough discussion
of the naval, technical, military, econo
nilc and political details is impossible
without injury to the interests of the
fatherland, and that without such
thorough discussion the subject could
not be completely cleared up."
KINGSTONIAN SAFE
British Freighter Reported Sunk In
Submarine Raid.
Boston, Oct. 13. The British steam
er Kingstonian reported as among
those torpedoed by a German subnfa
rine off Nantucket last Sunday, is safe
in port, according to word received
here yesterday by John M. Thomas,
local manager of the Leyland line,
which owns the steamer. .Mr. Thomns
said his information showed that the
Kinkstonian was thousands of miles
from Nantucket last Sunday.
As the Kingstonian is in the serv
ice of the British admiralty, Mr.
Thomas was not permitted to indicate
the port at which she had arrived,
but he said that it would take her
two weeks of steaming at her usual
speed to reach Nantucket, so that it
was evident she was nowhere near
the Fcene of the submarine's opera
tions in those waters last Sunday.
This information serves to confirm
the opinion held by marine men at
Boston that the report of the King
stonian's loss arose from a confusion
of her name with that of the steamer
Knudsen, the Norwegian tank steam
er sunk by the U. boat. Capt. Wilson
of the British steamer Strathdene.
another of the ships caught by the
submarine, hailed a passing vessel
and inquired her name. He under
stood the reply to be "Kingston" and
later after the submarine had tor
pedoed the same vessel and her crew
had taken to their boats, Capt. Wilson
reported to the Nantucket lightship
the loss of the supposed "Kingston."
There was no record of any steamer
of that name in these waters but it
wag thought possible that the King
stonian might be the submarine's
victim as on account of her work for
the British admiralty her movements
are not recorded in maritime regis
ters. The theory now held by ship
ping agents at Boston is that the ves
sel hailed by the Strathdene was the
Knudsen.

MORE TROUBLE IS EXPECTED
Standard Oil Workers Threatened to
Resist Police Who Invade Strike
District.
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 13. Police and
citizens are making an effort to settle
the strike of the Standard Oil em
ployes today with out calling out the
state militia.
The police have decided, however,
to clear out the gangs of idle men and
more trouble is expected. The body
of an unidentilied man, presumably a
Slav, was found today with a bullet
wound over the eye, making the third
death since the beginning of the
strike,
The strikers have threatened to re
sist the police if the scene of the
trouble is again invaded.
New York, Oct. 13. One man was
killed and a score of more were wound
ed, five dangerously, in riots in con
nection with the Standard Oil strike In
Bayonne yesterday afternoon. Follow
ing a night of terror, in which strike
sympathizers raided a saloon and a
clothing store and lour llres were
started by incendiaries, the police
cowed the army of idle men into at
least temporary submission.
The man killed was Isador Nalitsky,
22 years old, a lawyer employed in
the office of Nowman & Neiler. Na
litsky had gone to collect rents at a
house in the neighborhood of Fast
Twenty-first street and Prospect ave
nue. He was shot in the back, the bul
let entering one of the lungs, and fell
dead in the street. The police believe
the killing was the work of a sniper.
When the police tonight attempted
to repeat their work of clearing out
the "dead line" district they were fired
upon by strikers and sympathizers at
Nineteenth street and Avenue K.
Tle police returned the fire and
charged the crowd.
The police force which Invaded the
strike zone was composed of two hun
dred men, each armed with a riot gun.
a rifle, a revolver or a club. They
combed the district bounded by Feast
Twenty-llrst and Fast Twenty-eighth
streets. Avenue E and Prospect ave
nues known an the Gridiron com
pelling residents and shopkeepers to
remain indoors. When a man appear
ed in the street he was warned to go
inside. If he hesitated a shot was
fired over his head. Usually this warn
ing was sufficient.
Be sides clearing the streets the
police raided twelve saloons, smashing
bottles and opening beer kegs. City
Officials on Monday had ordered each
of the suloon keepers In the strike
area on Constable Hook to keep their
places closed. They believe that if
all liquor can he removed from the
men half the problem, so far as the
preservation of the peace Is concerned
will have been solved.

J BEATS ALL POTATO RECORDS
Willlamstown Farm Yields at Rate of
1013 Bushels Per Acre.
North Adams, Mass., Oct. 11.
Mount Hope larni In Willlamstow n.
owned by F. P. Prentice of New York
city, which has been devoting four
years of experimental work in the
growing of potatoes, had a potato day
yesterday and In the presen'ce of hun
dreds of people, turned out of the
ground the biggest yield of potatoes
on record so far as can be found. The
event was an important one in agri
cultural circles and there were pres
ent agricultural men from Massachus
etts, Vermont and New York. The
farm furnished a dinner and an or
chestra In connection with the event.
The Interest of the day centered in
an experimental field of seed potatoes
and in the field of market potatoes
planted by the 'planter and harvested
by commercial methods. !n the experi
mental field two varieties were raised
at Mount Hope. The Rural New York
er and the Mount Hope were planted
in alternate rows, sown from seed po
tatoes of different degrees of maturi
ty. So far as experiments at the farm
have gone, it seems probable that po
tatoes should not be dug less than 13
weeks from the time of blossoming.
Further experiments will be made
next year to determine this question.
Rural New York seed potatoes, dug
last year in less than 10 weeks from
the time of blossoming, gave yester
day a yield at the rate of about !00
bushels per acre. Rural New Yorker
for seed, which had the full 15 weeks
growth, yielded at the rate of over 800
bushels per acre.
Another question which the farm is
experimenting with is the elimination
of small hills. To accomplish this, all
hills of seed potatoes are cut separate
ly. In the winter these hills are sort
ed, small potatoes are thrown out, and
only strong, sound hills true to type
are preserved. Hills so selected are
planted by themselves and numbered
by stake. Two thousand, six hundred
and ninety were planted, each stake
containing on an average of 15 hills, a
total of 40.000 hills to be harvested,
weighed, stored and entered on the
record, besides about 20.000 hills
from productive seed which were
bought this year and with which the
work of breeding has just begun.
From all this seed there is chosen on
ly the large hills from even producing
stakes. At Mount Hope the effort :is
to produce seed potatoes of uniform
productivity. Yesterday it was shown
that great progress has been madij in
this direction. Sevenil large uniform
stakes of Mount Hope potatoes were
dug of which the hills In the heaviest
ran as high as 1,015 bushels per acre.
So far as is known there is no field on
record in the United States that can
equal this.
Besides the seed potatoes there was
also dug a field of market, potatoes,
planted from seed discarded last win
ter from the seed stock. This seed
showed a heavier yield under ordinary
commercial conditions Tor the market
and averaged 500 bushels per acre.
RUMANIA'S FATE
MAY DECIDE WAR
SAYS DILL10N
Leader Says Strung e Hinges
on Results in Balkans
URGES VIGOROUS MEASURES
England Must Not Permit Another
Ally to Suffer Like Belgium and
Serbia.
London, Oct. 12. John Dillon, Irish
National Member, complained In the
House of Commons today that Pre
mier Asquith in his speech yesterday
had given no assurance that the ut
most resources would be employed to
help Rumania in the hour of her trial
to save her from the fate of Belgium
and Serbia.
"If we allow Rumania to be over
run," said Mr. Dillon, "maybe we will
never beat Germany. There have
been sinister rumors that the British
Government regards the Salonica ex
pedition with an evil eye."
He expressed the belief that the war
would be decided in the Balqans and
asked for a plain assurance from tho
War Secretary that the Allies would
strain every nerve to assist Rumania
by a strong counter offensive in Mace
donia. David Lloyd George said that ob
viously he could not enter Into details,
but he could assure Mr. Dillon that
the Allies were doing their utmost to
mp port the Rumanian armies against
attacks.
"We have not the least doubt," said
the Minister, "that Germany is concen
trating her strength in order to crush
Rumania, not merely in her own in
terest, but in a spirit of vengeance be
cause a brave people dared challenge
her power."
Despatches from Berlin say that,
threatened by an encircling attack, the
Rumanians have had to evacuate their
positions in the Maros Valley, at the
northern end of the Transylvanlan
front. The German official statement
says that Gen. von Falkenhayn is
keeping up his pursuit of the Ruman
ians on the whole front and in the last
two days has captured ti57 prisoners,
one cannon and five machine guns.

SAILLY-SAILLISEL
NEXT OBJICT OF
ALLIED ATTACK
French Already Encircling Village
North of Somme
SHELLING GERMAN POSIIIQNS
Apparently Using Same Methods that
Resulted in Capture of Combles
and Thiepval.
Paris, Oct. 12. Gen Foch continued
today the encircling of Sailly-Saillisel,
the large village north of the Somme
that is one of the strongest points in
the present German line. The French
infantry, after heavy artillery fire,
pushed closer to the town from the
west at the point where their line
joins the British line near Morval.
The bame methods that resulted la
the fall of Combles and Thiepval are
slowly making the position of the Ger
mans at Sailly-Saillisel untenable.
North and west of it French and Brit
ish have pushed a wedge, and south of
it a French wedge reaches the wood of
St. Pierre Vanst. Artillery Is already
firing on the village from south, west
and northwest, depriving the Germans
of the protection of the ridge that part
ly hides the village.
Evidently the French south of the
river are about to take up again their
similar encircling movement aimed at
Chalnes, the important railroad junc
tion southwest of Peronne that Is so
valuable to the German positions In
the whole large Noyon salient of their
line. The artillery south of the river
was very active, the French War Of
fice reports and the German guna
answered heavily.
