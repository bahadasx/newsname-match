To Meet in this City Next
Tuesday to Inaugurate
Campaign.
Chairman J. H. Haughton of the
Putnam County Democratic Executive
Committee has called a meeting of
the committee in this city for next
Tuesday, Oct. 17th, at 11 o'clock a. m.
"This meeting," said Chairman
Haughton, "will be for the purpose of
inaugurating a vigorous campaign in
this county in behalf of all the nomi
nees of the democratic party, from
president down to justice of the peace.
The democratic party is this year con
fronted with a spirit of independent
ism which this committee must do its
utmost to suppress in the interests of
the party and good government. For
the first time in the recollection of
many the party has a break in its
ranks brought about by those who
have declared themselves above and
beyond allegiance to the will of the
democratic voters as expressed in the
recent democratic primaries of June
6th, and it will be the duty of this
committee to declare its unwavering
allegiance to the party nominee from
the head of the ticket down, and to
frown upon every attempt at inde
pendent action, no matter by whom at
tempted. The time has not come in
Florida when the white people can af
ford or risk a chance for republican
control, such as would surely follow
the election of an independent candi
date to high office, and especially of
any man whose utterances are boldly
defiant of democratic principles and
precedent. Putnam county is in no
danger, I take it, from these independ
ents or republicans, but as democrats
we must leave no duty undone look
ing to the preservation of honest gov
ernment and its administration by
men who have been selected for ser
vice therein by the white voters of
the State."

WOMAN'SJLUO HOUSE
In Palatka A Worthy Ob
ject How You Can
Help.
The Woman's Club of Palatka will
get out a special edition of the Pa
latka News on November 17 for the
benefit of the Woman's Club house.
The edition will be a very timely pub
lication for Palatka as it will pre
sent Putnam County's advantages in
a very interesting way for the bene
fit of the visitors during the Farmers
Convention November 21-24, and will
supply a deficiency that exists today
as there are very few of the Board of
Trade booklets on Palatka left, and
the demand is sure to exceed the sup
plv. The ladies in charge have planned
to print enough papers to meet the
requirements of the visitors for pub
lished matter to mail to their friends,
and the merchants of Palatka should
patronize this edition as it will be to
their advantage to do so. Aside
from the benefit they will got from
the advertising they will be giving de
served aid to an institution that will
prove of material benefit to the city
directly and also to the merchants of
Palatka.
There was in the city a few weeks
ago a traveling man recently assign
ed to Florida territory who was un
rWidprl whether he would locate in
Pnlat.ka or Gainesville. He said that

"The Fashion's" Opening.
All day long on Monday, the open
ing day, Palatka's new store, "The
Fashion," was crowded with ladies
who came to inspect the new store
and stock. The crowd did not stop
with Monday, but has continued every
day this week, so that by this time
most of the ladies of this city and a
rood nart of those who have visited
the city from the country are familiar
with the store and the elegant assorrt-
nient of ready-to-wear goods carried
''It is certainlv a beautiful store
remarked one well-known society lady
of this citv. "and there is assembled
a remarkable variety of coat suits,
coats, dresses, skirts and waists of
the most modern patterns and mate
rials such as few cities of Palatka's
size are permitted to boast of. True
the stock is not as large as in the
hiircrer cities, but this Mr. Fruchtman
explained in the statement that they
had difficulty in getting in all their
purchases, but that new goods were
coming in daily. But what Palatka
ladies will be most concerned about
Jacksonville, Oct. 11 The Demo
cratic Campaign Committee yes'terday
opened headquarters in the Heard
building and immediately went to
work to carry out the general plan
perfected at the committee meeting
here last Saturday. Stenographers
and clerks were busy yesterday get
ting out letters and shaping up in
formation to place in the hands of
the voters.
The Committee has had prepared
and has now ready to be turned over
to the printer for publication a com
plete illustrated campaign booklet
showing, by reproductions of the tally
book pages, errors made in various
counties by the inspectors and clerks
of the election and shown up in an
unanswerable and convincing manner
how the votes of the other candidates,
on account of the misunderstanding of
the proper method of counting sec
ond choice votes were made to count
for Mr. Catts for the reason that his
name appeared first on the ticket.
No argument so strong as these lllus
trations could be advanced that Catts
was never entitled to have received a
certificate or to have been considered
the nominee of the party. No Demo
crat who will take the time to exam
ine the facts this booklet contains and
has any respect for the will of the
voters, as expressed on the ballot, or
for the obligation he took when he
participated in the primary, can re
fuse to support the Democratic noml
Itineraries for speakers are being
arranged by the committee and they
will be advertised just as soon as com
pleted. Mr. Knott will likely begin
his campaign at St. Augustine or Pa
latka and will open with a speech
either Friday or Saturday. Next week
Mr. Knott will likely go to Suwannee,
Hamilton, Madison, Taylor, Lafayette
and Columbia counties. From two to
three sDeeches will be made daily.
Picnics and barbecues will be arranged
and every possible effort put forth to
have a large crowd to meet the head
of the stiite ticket at all of his appointment-!.
Nothing will be left un
done by the committee to show the
Democratic voters of Florida that they
have no justifiable reason for desert-
mer the Democracy to take up with
the Independents or the Prohobition
party that is run by John f. cotnn
and his wife, assisted by their son,
who has been nominated to oppose
Honorable Frank Clark, Democratic
nominee for Congress in the second
district.
Information is coming to the com
mittee headquarters from the Second
Congressional District to the effect
that many of the Catts' Clubs have
secretly endorsed Mr. Coffin for Con
gress and that it was the encourage
ment offered by these organizations
that prompted Mr. Coffin to put his
son in the race for Congress. Dur
ing the primary campaign Mr. Cof
fin worked and solicited votes for Mr.
Catts and it is alleged that he has
been making his political headquar
ters in the same room here in Jack
sonville that is known as the Catts
Club Headquarters. The convention
that was held here in Jacksonville a
fow weeks aero and nominated Mr,
Catts was held in the room that the
Guardians of Liberty and Patriotic
Sons of America hold their meetings
The convention was held behind closed
doors and about the only information
that was ever riven the public was
that the convention wn held and that
Mr. Coffin. Sr.. was Chairman: Mrs.
Coffin. Secretary and Mr. Coffin Jr.,
was chr.irman of the Committee on
Platform and Resolutions and that
thev had nominated a State ticket,
headed by Sydney J. Catts for gover

The Federal Farm Loan Board will
visit Jacksonville October 26th., and it
is the request of Senator Duncan U.
Fletcher, and the Chamber of Com

No greater law has been passed in re

Loan Act for farmers and business
men who need its assistance most. I
assure you that to secure one of these
banks for Florida will be a notable
honor of our State, give it distinction
as a worth while region, and be of un
told benefit to our people from ft
source right at our own doors.
Your attendance at this gathering

of our State, by the City of Jackson
