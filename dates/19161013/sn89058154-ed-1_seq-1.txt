SELMER. McNAIRY COUNTY. TENN.. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, IQ16."
NUMBER 15
From the small crowds that so
far have attended the speakings
in Tennessee it would seem the
yeomanry are not getting up
much red blood. All the speak
ing will not change many voters.
Democrats are democrats and re
publicans are republicans. The
effect only can be of getting vot
ers out. Thousands in the state
have not qualified by paying
their poll tax, and will have to
stand aside.
' The presidential campaign is
getting up some heat. The wom
en are taking a big interest in
the results. New York women
have a special trairi touring the
West in the interest of Hughes.
They are not advocating suffrage,
but seem to be engaged in elect
ing their choice, concluding that
uniyersal suffrage is in the near
future in every state. They are
an element to be considered.
The arrival unheralded of a
German submarine armed and
ready for battle at New York
Saturday, created great surprise.
It stayed three hours, delivering
a letter to the German Ambassa
dor, and left at a rapid speed to
the three mile line, ducked and
went out to sea. Just what its
mission was is unknown. It could
make havoc with English battle
ships on our border if it tried.
To say the least, it was a specta
cular piece of international impudence.
Be a Regular Man
There are many men in this
county who have not paid their
poll taxes. They are good men,
but careless. This condition
should not exist. It makes no
matter whether you are a Repub
Jjcan, Democrat, Progressive, or
. what not, if you would maintain
your self respect as a part and
parcel of the government of this
state, you should exercise that
sovereign right granted you by
your state, and put yourself in
shape to vote on - November 7th,
when not only state officers are
to be elected, but a President and
Vice-President of the United
States.
Be a regular man and get your
poll tax straight It is worth
the price to feel like a man, and
no male twenty-one years old is a
man who cannot take, his stand
by his fellow man and vote his
convictions in a free and untram
eled country

Pope Favors Protective Tariff for
Agriculture .
(Supplied by A. & C. Press Bureau,
. Port Worth, Texaa.)
Fort Worth, Texas, OcL 16-In a
memorial to Congress issued today
entitled "The American Farmer and
His Government," H. N. Pope, presi
dent" of the Association of State
Farmers' Union Presidents, favors
protection on all agricultural pro
ducts, declares that no country can
thrive half protected and half free,
insists that there is no such thing as
a hyphenated tariff and asks that cot
ton be protected by a twelve cent
minimum loan from the government.
The memorial, which goes into an
exhaustive analysis' of the subject,
ays in part: x
The Southern cotton farmer, in
demanding that, Congress empower
the Federal Reserve Board to fix and
protect a twelve cent per pound min
imum loan price on cotton, advances
no new doctrine In government, for
it has been the policy of this nation
ever since we have had a nation to
protect home industries. Cotton is
our only agricultural product that
cannot be helped by a protective
tariff, and must, therefore, seek other
means of protection. A twelve cent
minimum loan on cotton will give to
cotton the tame protection that the
tariff can give to other agricultural
products.
1HE PLIGHT OF THE COTTON
FARMER
"The cotton producer is the only
class of farmers who has always been
compelled to sell what he produced
on a free market and buy what he
oansumed on a protected market and
as a consequence, the cotton fields of
the south have more tenants, more
poverty and more suffering than any
othet agricultural area in. the .West
ern Hemisphere. This condition
should challenge, but not baffle,
American statesmanship. Henry N.
Pope. . ,
Jackson, Tennessee
October 6, 1916.

Enclosed find check for $1.50 to
keep the Independent coming to our

old home. Wife and I are very anx
ious to get the .Independent every

Cotton picking is the order of the
day. The crop in this part will be
very short this year. The boll weevil
has destroyed the greater part of the
crop. It will take about five acres to
make a bale on an averyge.
Cotton is selling for about 15 cents,
and cotton seed is worth ' forty-five
dollars per ton at Saint Jo. twelve
miles from here. All crops except
cotton are very good this year; such
as corn, oats, peanuts, sweet pota
toes, watermelons and all kinds of
vegetables, . ..,,. "
1916 hag been the hottest, more
rain, more boll weevils than any year
since they came into Texas, and the
last part of September the coolest in'
many years some frost the 29th,
Wishing you and alt the old M
Nairians prosperity, I remain,
Yours truly,

THE CIRCUS IN WINTER
One of the Busiest Seasons for
the Carl Hagenbeck-Wallace
Shows. .
A circus of the caliber of the Carl
Hagenbeck-Wallace Show does not
run its season, dissolve and disperse.
In winter the entire e&tablishment is
maintained. Only the performers
and the workmen are dropped, and
with the former this is generally a
mere suspension of service, for con
tracts are frequently made for several
years Uwners, managers, contract
agents, advertising agents, treasurer,
bookkeepers and others find no idle
moments.
Railroad cars, suffering from the
bard effects of a season's campaign,
need painter and carpenter; new acts
and novelties must be secured to keep
abreast of the times; the 'new route
must be laid out and considered, and
to do this the management must know
the population and character of every
town, have information of the bus
iness conditions, vicissitudes of the
year, etc.
The question of transportation is
the most careful one involved. For
instance, up in agricultural Windsor
County, Vermont, nestles the village
of White River Junction'. It boasts
of a weekly rewspaper, a public school
and a national bank. Its population
does not exceed 1,500, yet the Hagenbeck-Wallace
Circus makes almost an
nual pilgrimages thither because it h
a local trade center, three railroads
converging upon it in addition to two
rivers. Ordinarily the town would
not furnish enough patrons to pay
for the feed for three herds of ele
phants, but the throngs conveyed
there by train and boat always fill the
tents. -
Not in anyways does the Carl
Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus of the
present seaeon resemble the shows of
other years. The employees of the
great institution number almost 1,000.
Twenty-two tents that cover a space
equal to a small-size farm is needed
to house the big show in the daytime.
At night the circus is transported
from city to city on three or the long
est trains in the world. s
More than 400 performer?, together
with the famous Carl - Hagenback
trained wild animals, appear on the
program of the big show, which will
come to Corinth Thursday, Oct. 19,
for performances at 2 and 8 p. m.,
and an immense street parade at 10
o'clock.
MANY IN SELMER
TRY SIMPLE MIXTURE
Many Selmer peoplo are surprised
at the QUICK action of simple buck
thorn bark, glycerine, etc., as mixed
in Adler-i-ka. This simple remedy
acts on BOTH upper and lower bowel,
removing such surprising foul matter
that ONE SPOONFUL relieves almost
ANY CASE constipation, sour stom
ach or gas. A few doses often re
lieve or prevent appendicitis. A short
treatment helps chronic stomach
trouble. The INSTANT, easy action
of Adler-i-ka is astonishing. Brow
