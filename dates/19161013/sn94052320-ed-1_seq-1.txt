Lost Land Regained
Referring to his recent purchase of
, quarter section of land, J. N. York,
remarked while fa town the other day.
that as he lost the same piece in Uiii,
under a democratic administration it
waa quite a gratifying and proper co-
incidence that he was now enabled to
fcuy it back under another democratic;
administration. Mr. York, ie a rock-
ribbed republican, but is willing to
concede that a reasonble degree of
prosperity is beieng enjoyed under
-Unwashed and Unterriued euspic-
es whether or not it is due to the
war, ' "
in 1S83 Mr. York bought 320 acres
0f land from John Ky-k for $8000, or
$25 an acre. In 18U2 ha found he
couldn't hold it all and "get by." Tht
quarter from which he then reluct-
aatly parted is the one he has just
bought for $100 an acre, or $75 an
acre more than he was unable to pay
24 years ago. Having always kept
an eye on k ana oeing.aoie 10 acijuuTi
to 640 acres.
In 1893 John Kirk sold the quarter
in quesUon to "Uncle Billy" Bade for
only $2800. He took tow money to
me nnn - '
valued at more than $20,000.
All of which goes to show how Or-
