ROOSEVELT MAY STOP FEW
MINUTES NEXT WEDNESDAY
Republicans Want Ex-Moose Chief to
Stop As He Goes From Cor-
bin to Louisville.
Local Republicans and others who
.have a curiosity to see him are in
terested in the possibility that ex
President Roosevelt may make a
.short address in Stanford next Wed
nesday afternoon. The man who
made and mangled the Bull Moose
party is scheduled for a speech at
Corbin about one o'clock that after
noon, and his special train then will
make a run for Louisville where it
is reported, he will speak that night.
Local Republicans and admirers of
Roosevelt are making an effort to
have his train stopped at Stanford,
that he make a few minutes' ad
dress to the voters on behalf of
Hughes, who, together with Taft,
Barnes, Penrose, Smoot and others
of the Old Guard Roosevelt, is sup
porting this year. Roosevelt would
undoubtedly draw a large crowd for
many would like to see just what he
looks like.
Democratic Speaking Dates.
Congressman Harvey Helm goes
to Junction City tonight where he
will address the voters on behalf of
Wilson and the ticket. He will un
doubtedly be greeted by a large
crowd for he is a great favorite
there. He spoke at Warsaw, Galli
tin county, Tuesday to a courtroom
full of people, which was considered
rather remarkable for a Tuesday
crowd.
Democratic speakings are arousing
much interest all over Lincoln coun
ty and extraordinarily good audien
ces are turning out. The feature
this week was the maiden speech
Thursday nighr of Harvey Wilkin
son, youngest sop of Mr. and Mrs.
Ed Wilkinson, of this city, which was
delivered at 0. K. schoolhouse.
Young Wilkinson has been acting as
secretary to Congressman Helm for
about a year, and though a mere
youth, he made a crackerjack speech
and gave the voters of that part of
the county the old gospel of Democ
racy in a way which would have done
credit to a man much his senior in
years. He "made good" right off
the reel, speaking for about 40 min
utes, and greatly pleased all who
heard him. Oliver Singleton pre
sided at the meeting and introduced
Mr. Wilkinson. About 75 voters
were out at the speaking. Other
speaking dates which have been an
nounced by the local campaign com
mittee are as follows:

Changing Seasons Bring Colds
"Stuffed-up head," clogged-up
nose, tight chest, sore throat are sure
signs of cold, and Dr. King's New
Discovery is sure relief. A dose of
this combination of antiseptic balsams
soothes the irritated membrane,
clears the head, loosens the phlegm,
you breath easier and realize your
cold is broken up. Treat a cold per
sistently; half-way measures leave a
lingering cough. Take Dr. King's
New Discovery until your cold is
gone. For 47 years the favorite rem
edy for young and old. At your drug

25 Cents Destroys
Your Dandruff and
Stops Falling Hair
Save Your Hair! Make It Thick
Wavy and Beautiful Try This
Thin, brittle, colorless and scraggy
hair is mute evidenece of a neglected
scalp; of dandruff that awful scruf.
There is nothing so destructive to
the hair as dandruff. It robs the hair
of its lustre, its strength and its very
life; eventually producing a feverish
ness and itching of the scalp, which
is not remedied causes the hair roots
to shrink, loosen and die then the
hair falls out fast. A little Danderine
tonight now any time will sure
ly save your hair.
Get a 25-cent bottle of Knowlton's
Danderine from any drug store or
toilet counter, and after the first ap
plication your hair will take on that
life lustre and luxuriance which is so
beautiful. It will become wavy and
fluffy and have the appearance of
abundance, an incomparable gloss
and softness; but what will please
you most will be after just a few
week's, when you will actually see a
lot of fine, downy hair new hair
growing all over the scalp. 81-1

Politicians Promised Hiu
John C. Penplcs, who went from

where the siate's branch penitenti
ary is located, under promise of Gov.
Stanley that he would be appointed
superintendent of the prison farm,
returned to Lincoln late last week,
hunting for a farm to rent so as to
return here with his family. He
found when he reached Eddyville,
that instead of being farm superin
tendent at $100 according to promise,
he was merely an over-guaid, and
drawing a guard's salary of $75 a
month upon which he and his family
cannot live. Both Mr. Pepples and
Representative W. G. Gooch, who
secured his appointment from Stan
ley, as well as his host of other
friends, feel that he has not been
treated exactly right. Mr Pepples is
a successful and up-to-date farmer in
every way and. splendidly qualified
for the place of Farm Superintendent
which he and his friends thought he
would get.

the world, even your faith. I. John,
5:4.
Dear Reader. While sitting here
in these dark prison walls, I can
realize more fully what Jesus meant
when he said, "My people shall be
tried as by fire." Today I am going
through the fiery trials for Jesus'
sake. Because I love Jesus and de
sire to do his will, I am here. Only
we, who have tasted of the cup of
suffering know what Jesus meant
when he said, "If we suffer with Him
we shall also reign with Him." Dear
people, I never knew what suffering
with Him really meant; I never knew
just how great was His suffering;
when He was paying the great debt
for me, never did I realize how great
the price was that was paid for my
eternal redemption until I took my
precious curly-haired baby in my
arms and pressed his sweet lips to
mine and looked down into his sweet
baby face, perhaps for the last time,
and turned my face from him to fol
low Jesus. Oh, dear reader, I could
tell then what the great loving Fa
ther above suffered for me. When
he unbosomed His dear and only Son
and sent Him down here in this cruel
world to be buffetted and spit on
and mocked and was taken before
the council and even put to death,
no wonder the whole earth shook
and the rocks rent; no wonder the
world was draped in darkness; no
wonder all creation mourned. No, I
don t wonder why my Heavenly Fa
ther turned His blessed face and re
fused to look upon it. The scene
was too great, and today, since I
have tasted of that great suffering,
my soul is made to cry out, "O, Lord,
how awfully ashamed I am that I
helped to cause that great suffering
on the cross, by transgressing God's
Holy law. But beneath all my suf
fering there's a deep settled peace
that I found at the foot of that
cross, when I said, "Lord, I am so
sorry I ever sinned and caused you
this suffering." I said, "I will bear
the cross now, Father, the rest of
my days and I have carried it for
eight long years and today I find
myself still under it. I have no de
sire to lay it down, for when I lay
down the cross I lay down the
crown. I fully realize that the cross
which I am now carrying will ex
change at the end of the race for a
crown of eternal life. I am not tired
of the way, for it grows brighter
each day I walk in it. Dear reader,
I wish I could see you face to face,
for I have found the pearl of great
price. God said, "Come buy of me
gold that is tried." Praise His dear
name, I have found that gold that
has been tried. It will stand the
test of the judgment. So pray for
my babies that are at home without
father or mother. I may see them
again God only knows. God said
they would take us before rulers
and before the council and commit
us to prison, yea, even kill us, and
think they were doing God's service;
but may the Good Lord bless them,
for they know not what they do. I
am more determined to go on with
Jesus than ever before.
Your loving friend, in Jesus, wait
ing for his coming,
MRS. J. E. JOHNSON.

HUNTERS FINED
WHEN GAME WARDEN EMBRY
DISCOVERS VIOLATIONS
W. R. Willis Convicted of Hunting
Without License and Negroes
Shot Rabbits Out of Season
The first conviction obtained in
Lincoln county for violation of the
law against hunting without a li
cense was secured in county court
here Thursday. W. R. Willis, well
known grocer and restauranteur of
was fined $15 and costs by Judge
Bailey on a charge of hunting with
out a license. The case was prose
cuted by District Game warden S.
J. Embry, who was given informa
tion of Mr. Willis deed and imme
diately took out a warrant for him.
It developed that Mr. Willis, who
had been feeling ill, saw some squir
rels on Joe Chancellor's farm on the
Crab Orchard pike, one day, when
he went out to get a beef he had
bought. He secured permission
from Mr. Chancellor to kill a few
to make some soup, not realizing
that he was violating the law. As
the case was a plain, open and shut
violation, however, Judge Bailey had
no recourse but to fine him. Mr.
Willis replevied the fine.
Judge Bailey had barely finished
with the Willis' trial until Game
Warden Embry came in with Will
Lee and Charles Hocker, two local
negroes, whom he had caught "dead
to rights" hunting rabbits out of
season. Rabbits are protected by the
game laws of the state the same as
birds. The colored men ran right in
to trouble by crossing Mr. Embry's
farm on the Lancaster pike. Lee was
carrying a shotgun and Hocker had
a bunch of rabbits. Lee claimed that
he did not kill the rabbits and Hocker
said their dog had caught them,
which is permitted under the law.
An examination showed, however,
that the rabbits had been shot so,
Judge Bailey slapped fines of $15
and costs on each of them. Lee re
plevied his fine, while Hocker went
to jail to serve out his. Game War
den Embry is the livest man on this
job, that has ever been seen in this
or any other part of the state, and
violators of the game laws are learn
ing of it to their sorrow. If all Game
Wardens were as active in the per
formance of their duties as he, Ken
tucky would never hear the complaint
that the supply of game birds and
small animals has been depleted.
AGED BOOTLEGGER CAUGHT.
Deputy Sheriff Monroe Thompson
of Waynesburg, and Deputy U. S.
Marshal Charles Winfrey, of Somer

eminent license. When taken into-
custody he had a gallon jug of booze
in his hand, Mr. Thompson says. The
old man was taken to jail until his
trial is held in Uncle Sam's court.
