THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, OCTOBER 13, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR
HIGH SCHOOL MAKES
GOOD SHOWING IN
FOOT BALL
The high school foot ball squad
made an excellent showing in a
spirited scrimmage against the Col
lege of Idaho eleven Tuesday even
ing, and Coach Houghton predicts
that the season will bring forth an
other championship team for the high
school this year.
The entire squad is made up of new
timber but the boys have been work
ing hard until they have developed un
usual speed and accuracy for a high
school eleven. They are beginning to
handle the forward pass like veterans,
and in the open style of play they are
are bound to offer a style of game that
will be especially pleasing to the foot
ball fans. Coach Houghton predicts
that this first game of the season will
bring out some latent stars that the
public knows nothing of, and that the
usual shake up that follows the first
game will present an eleven that
offer a formidable front to any team
in southern Idaho.
Qaptain Elected.
At a meeting of the football squad
éarly this week Joe Ewing was chosen
as captain of the team. It is generally
considered that the boys made an ex
cellent choice in their captain as Joe
has had more actual first team ex
perience than any other member who
has been in regular attendance at Cald
well high school. Whitsit Wilson was
elected manager.
Victrola Purchased for Washington
School
The Parent Teachers' Circle of the
The Parent Teachers' Circle of the
Washington school has been carry
ing on a spirited campaign to secure
funds for the purchase of a Victrola
for their building and this week a
handsome machine was installed there
as a reward for their efforts. This is
the third machine that has been se
cured for the schools, all buildings
possessing one excepting the high
school.
Professor Beale to Talk.
At a meeting of the Washington
Circle of the Parent-Teachers' asso
ciation next Thursday afternoon Pro
fessor Beale will give a talk and dem
onstrate the use of the Victrola for
school purposes. A large attendance
is urged to hear this program as_ it
will be very instructive as well as in
teresting.
Van Buren Circle to Entertain.
The Van Bur,en Parent-Teachers'
Circle has undertaken a scheme to
make their school more of a social
center during the winter season. Next
Monday evening they are inviting all
the patrons and friends of that school
to a fine program iwhich will be
presented. After this, there will be' a
social hour and refreshments served.
They expect to receive a large crowd.
This meeting is purely for social pur
poses and the invitation is open to
all.
Manual Training Department Does
Practical Work.
The Manual Training department of
„ the high school is larger than ever
before, the total enrollment being 124.
Sixty-four are enrolled for woodwork
amd sixty in the mechanical and ar
chitectural drawing departments. One
interesting fact about the enrollment
is that over 20 per cent of it is girls,
and they are taking an unusual in
terest in these practical courses. Mr.
Burns, the head of the working de
partment, is giving some of the
students who are especially interested
in the course in agriculture, some very
practical work in making corn driers
and various other practical devices
which are useful on the farm, instead
of giving the entire time to making
furniture. An effort is being ' na f| c
to correlate this department with the
domestic arts and agriculture depart
ments this year, more closely than it
has been heretofore.
Boys Help Make New Class Room.
The manual training boys under the
direction of the instructors of that
department have erected a partition
through the large room that was used
for office and book room thereby
making another class room of ample
space and leaving a small room for
the superintendent's office. 1 he
take a great deal of interest in this
practical work, and at the same time it
is a decided advantage to the district.
Take Many Prizes at Fair.
The schools took many prizes at the
Idaho State Fair last week. Am ong
them were the blue tickets for best
exhibit of Sewing, Cooking and Man
ual Arts. There were also many in
dividual prizes secured by high school
students in these three departments.
The grades secured second prize in
their art work and severâl first prizes
on individual entries.
Garden and Sewing Clubs Again Re
warded.
The garden and sewing clubs were
again rewarded for the good showing
they have made, carrying away the
honors at this fair as well^ as the one
at Boise. Caldwell is to be con
gratulated on the work done by the
boys an'd girls in this line and every
effort should be. made to assist in the
continuance of it.

GEM FARMERS SUBSTITUTE
AUTOES FOR PATCHES
Good Crops and Good Prices Make
Owyhee Farmers Happy.
F. E. Trotter, publisher of the Em
pire Press of Homedale, representa
tive in the legislature from Owyhee
county, and Republican nominee for
re-election, was in the city Wednes
day. Mr. Trotter visited Boise and
other points befor returning home.
He states that Homedale and vi
cinity are in good condition. Crops
have been fine in spite of a shortage
of water. Good prices prevailed and
everybody is happy. Mr. Trotter said;
"There are any number of farmers
in the Gem Irrigation District sitting
on the cushions of automobiles today
ho a year or two ago sat upon
patches. Everybody did well and the
evidence is at hand in automobiles,
better farm house and farm build'ngs,
ore and better stock, better equip
ment and other improvements. Im
provements in the irrigation system
will materially reduce the cost of
maintenance and henceforth our sec
tio>n will be on its feet financially."
Mr. Trotter is gteatly interested in
the proposed state highway between
Caldwell and Jordan Valley. He, to
gether with the people of Owyhee
county, is also advocating the con
struction of five bridges across Snake
river. He has hopes of putting this
through. Owyhee county will do a
part, Canyon a part and the state a
part. This distribution of the o irden
will make it easy for all.
Mr. Trotter served faithfully and
efficiently in the last legislature. He
will be re-elected without fail.
W. R. WILKERSON RETURNS
FROM VISIT IN TEXAS
Mrs. Wilkerson Will Return Later—
Will Locate at Boise.
W. R. Wilkerson has 'been in the
city a few days this week. He has
just returned from Bells, Texas. Mrs
Wilkerson will not return until about
the 25th of the month. They will lo
cate in Boise where Mr. Wilkerson is
general agent for Idaho of the Mutual
Benefit Life Insurance company.
Mr. Wilkerson was troubled with
cataract on his eye. The cause of his
trouble was removed and safely
stowed away. After giving his eyes
a short rest he is convinced that his
sight will be as good as ever.
"Texas is very prosperous," said M
Wilkerson Wednesday, "the cotton
growers are getting 15 cents a pound
for their cotton. All other farm
products are on the same basis. Con
ditions generally are good."
Mr. Wilkerson said that he
sorry that his business required him
to move to Boise. He would much
prefer to remain here where he has
made his residence for the past
years. However, his new position
a very desirable one and a big pro
motion and he does not feel that he
can afford to refuse it.
LATE TRAINS DELAY
SUFFRAGE LEADERS
A fair sized crowd of disappointed
women and a generous sprinkling of
curious me"n gathered at the Huree
theatre Wednesday afternoon to heai
the much heralded suffrage leaders
Inez M. Boissevain and Sara Bard
Field, who were scheduled to speak
this city. Owing to belated trains, the
two speakers were unable to fill their
appointment—hence the disappointed
audience.
Miss Barker, a member of the tour
ing party, was instroduced by Mrs.
W A. Stone, and filled the difficult
role of substitute in a most pleasing
mannre. Her plea, which is represen
tative of that of the group of dis
tinguished women now touring the
west in behalf of nationwide suffrage
for women, is from the unenfranchised
women of the south and east, asking
their voting sisters in suffrage states
to withhold their support from the
Democratic party which has refused to
stand for national suffrage by consti
tutional amendment.
Miss Barker accounted for the pre
ponderance of suffrage territory in
the west in two ways: there is a larger
proportion of liberal-minded people in
that section, and the constitutions of
western states suit themselves more
readily to changing conditions.
Indiana was cited as an example of
the difficulty in amending state con
stitutions, a majority of all qualified
oters being required to effect
change. In eleven other states,
majority of all votes cast is .necessary
and in a dozen other no provision is
made for calling an election to con
amendment. Where the legal
requirements are not prohibitive, pre
judice gets in some telling licks. _
The speaker dwelt on the incfcmsis
tcncy of allowing foreigners with just
sufficient residence to make citizen
ship possible the right to vote on the
Question of whether American born
women shall have the right to vote at
all in the land of their nativity, bhe
cited the fact that the organized liquor
interests have always been against
woman's suffrage, leaving the infer
ence that such attitude was compli
mentary. . ,
Women have waited nearly 70 years
for a hearing on this question and are
just getting into a position to de
mand an answer. Because it happens
to be the party in power, and because
it has failed to recognize national suf
frage as a paramount issue, the Demo
cratic party is in decided disfavor with
the unenfranchised women of the na
tion, who are pleading for its further
disfavor by all women voters.

TESTS RESPONSIBLE FOR
CULLING IN DAIRY HERDS
Adviser Ireland Finds That Owners
Arc Sellnig ''Boarder" Cows.
Evidence of the good results
being brought about through operation
of the Boise Valley Cow Testing as
sociation is citd by H. A. Ireland,
project advisor, in announcing the
past month's records, in the fact that
many herd owners have begun culling
out unprofitable animals.
That this result is being achieved
five months from the time the asso
ciation was organized is pointed out
as gratifying bv the project advisor.
He cites the fact that during the first
year's operation of the esting asso
ciation at Buhl 70 "boarder" cow
were consigned to the block.
During the month ending Septem
ber 15, 41 cows of the 406 under
scrutiny of Tester H. H. Beier pro
duced 40 pounds of butterfat or bet
ter The .number making this record
in August was 44. There was also a
slight decrease in the number of
herds averaging 30 pounds of fat or
better.
The best individual record was at
tained by cow No. 4 of the J. U.
Wuest herd, a grade Guernsey. She
produced 80.14 pounds of butterfat.
French Buy 250 Horses.
Little difficulty was experienced by
the agents of the French government
in securing the 250 horses thev came
to purchase through the Caldwell
market. About October 20 the French
buiyers are to return here for the pur-1
pose of obtaining that many more
1 animals.
ENTHUSE OVER
PROPOSED ROAD
Plans ( r Caldwell-Winnemucca High
way Furthered at Club Session.
Plans for construction of the Cald
well-Winnemuccja |highway received
a big boost at a meting of the Com
mercial club Tuesday evening.
Delegations of good size were près
ent from Wilder and Homedale, and
two or three enthusiasts from Mai
heur county, Oregon, also attended
These visitors told of progress of the
highway movement in their sections
J. R. Blackaby of Ontario said Mal
heur county stands ready to do its
share toward making possible the
nroposed roadway. Reports received
at this meeting ,and previously show
that even greater progress in planning
to finance the undertaking has been
made in Oregon and Nevada territory
than at this end of the route.
Owyhee County to Co-operate.
The representatives from Wilder
and Homedale showed the importance
of the proposed road to their commu
nities. Thev declared that Owyhee
county stands ready to vote appropri
ations to cover half of the cost of as
manv as three new bridges across the
Snake river if Canyon county will take
similar action.
Club members who spoke for Cald
well gave assurantes that every ef
fort will be put forth at this end of
the route to hasten construction of
the road.
Development of plans of action was
placed in the hands of the regular
road committee of the^ club. The
members comprising this committee
?re Walter Griffiths. W. G. Co" - den,
D. L. Shank. B. M. Holt and W P.
Lyon. President Zeh is to act with
these committeemen, and he has
named Dr. T. W. Gtie as a seventh
member of the committee.
|
Some Funds Available.
Promises are said to have been ob
tained from the county commissioners
to expend the fortion of road money
accruing in Caldwell territory subject
to their disposition, in permanently
improving one main road into the
city. It is probable that they will be
asked to expand these funds on the
proposed road between here and Win
nemucca. The commissioners leave
the matter of selecting the particular
road to be improved largelv to recom
mendations of the Commercial club.
It is to bp the work of the committee
selected Tuesdav evenin- to make in
vestigations and recommendations in
this particular.
Aside from the voting In or 10 new
members and transaction of routine
business, the discussion of road mat
ters occupied the entire session of the
club.
A real estate deal of some dimen
sions affecting local parties was con
summated last week, when J. A. De
ment, Sr.. and son, J. A„ traded their
Caldwell residences and other city
property together with a ranch sJUth
of town for a five-hundred acre ranch
above Arrowrock. M. E. Curtis of
Payette was the other party in the
deal, and has already taken charge of
his newly acquired property. Mr. De
ment, Sr., will make his home on the
ranch near Arrowrock, while his son
will remain in business in Caldwell,
being associated with the Caxton
Printers.

EIGHT-STORY BUILDING
SHATTERED BY A BOMB
It Had to Be Done, in New Triangle
Collier Picture, and Thos. H.
Ince Did It.
In the course of the action of "The
Xo-Good Guy," a feature photoplay in
which William Collier is starred on
the Triangle program, one of the most
enuine bomb explosions ever staged
'ace, with a
eight-story
genuin
Before the camera takes place, with a
^reek of
resultant
building.
It took producer Thomas H. Ince
exactly one month to make that short
scene possible. He hunted all over
California, it seemed, to find a build
ing about to be torn down that he
could destroy for the sake of his Col
lier story; hut none could be found
for a long time. By keeping in touch
with the Tenement Department, the
Board of Fire Underwriters and the
Boarifof Health, he at length learned
of an eight-story concrete corner
structure iwitli a frontage on two
streets of 100 feet each, newly erected
but utterly condemned by the authori
ties beclause of some architectural
defect.
Whereas Ince would not have been
permitted to blow up most buildings
because of possible damage to adjoin
ing property, this structure had been
poured almost as one piece in arti
ficial stone, and absolutely required
the use of dynamite. It cost Ince a
good round sum to substitute his
bomb for the explosive intended for
use by the workers: but the deal went
through, and the explosion did its
work in highly saisfaetory manner.
In the scene as it is shown by the
camera, the building is rent asunder by
an explosion that is seen to shoot up
ward through the eight floors and
;ave in the side walls. And yet it oc
cupies but five feet of film, which
means eighty pictures running about
four to the second, or something over
a quarter of a minute. At the Bunga

Boys' and Girls'Clubs Winners. 1
The exhibits of the Boys' and Girls' I
Clubs of the county at the recent fairs
as an eye -opener on this phase of
modern education, the youthful com
Petitors having delivered the goods of
excellent quality and in attractive con
dition. The work of the clubs has
been under the general supervision of
Miss Fowler, countv superintendent of
schools, and W. T. McCall, county
agriculturist, each club having its own
local supervisor. The juvenile corn
and potato growers outstripped their
grown-up competitors at Boise. Nam

won first prize on red and yellow corn
and second on white in the men's
classes. At Boise thev won first and
third on white corn, third and fourth
on yellow corn and second on single
ear At the state fair here they won
first and third on white corn and
third on yellow. All that hindered the
the boys from winning out on poia
toes over the men was the fact that
thev di d not send enough to fill the
entry requirements.
In the cooking and sewing clubs,
the girls carried off all sorts of honors,
Miss Kate Moss of Pleasant Ridge

EDITOR 1HE TRIBUNE
ARRESTED CHARGE
OF LIBEL
II. A. Griffiths, prosecuting attorney
for Canyon county, began proceedings
against J. L. Davis, editor of The
Tribune, Monday, when Mr. Davis was
arrested on a charge of criminal libel.
The defendant was taken before Mr.
Justice McVey, who fixed the bonds
of the defendant at $1000.00. The
bonds were promptly furnished. The
preliminary hearing will be held be
fore Justice McVey at the city hall to
day at 10 o'clock.
Mr. Griffiths bases his charge on
articles which appeared in the last
issue >f The Tribune. The articles in
question told the story of the Huntz
berry case as it occurred in the pro
bate court; the action taken by a num
ber of citizens of the community in
asking that a special prosecutor be
employed by the county commission
ers to prosecute Huntzberry; the peti
tion of the citizens of Caldwell who
protested against the methods that
had been employed; and editorial com
ment on the whole transaction.
Second Libel Suit.
This is th second libel suit Attor
ney Griffiths has filed against The
Tribune within the past few months.
The first suit was a civil action where
Mr. Griffiths alleged that he had
been libeled by The Tribune and
risked for damages in the sum of
$t0,ix)0.00. The first suit has never
been brought to trial.
Huntzberry Case.
The Huntzberry case is attracting
wide attention and not a little criti
|cism. Huntzberry was accused of
crime against nature. He had been in
tbe CO unty jail for several months
when Mr. Griffiths instituted insanity
proceedings in the probate court.
Huntzberry was found to be of un
sound mind and committed to the
asvlum for the insane. The Tribune
criticised the action that was taken
particularly the method employed,
Mr. Griffith felt that he had been in
hired and instituted crimin-.l proceed
ings against the editor of The Tri
bune.
Bar Asked to Investigate,
Mr. Griffiths has asked the Canyon
. ~ ou lit y Bar association to investigate
his official conduct. He has addressed
the following communication to the
association: - , , n , OI ,
Caldwel, Idaho, Oct. 10. 1916.
To the Canyon County Bar Associa
tion, D. D. Harger, President.
Gentlemen: Whereas charges have
been made by The Caldwell Tribune,
of October 6, 1916, a newspaper of
general circulation in Canyon county,
that I have been guilty of corupt
practice likely to bring discredit upon
this association and the Bar in gen
eral.
1 therefore demand that you con
vene the Canyon County Bar A.sso
ciation for the purpose of mvestigat
ing the truth or falsity of said charges,
a copy of which are attached hereto,
