RUMANIA APPEALS
TO THEJLLIES
Asks Entente Nations Not to
Let Them Suffer Fate of
Serbia.
WILL NOT FALTER
Country Believes in Justice of
Cause and Has Faith in
Associates.
London, Oct 13, 3(:20 a. m. The
Times publishes an interview given
to its correspondent with the Ruma
nian army by the king of Rumania in
which the monarch appeals to the al
lies not to permit his country to
suffer the fate of Serbia and Belgium.
"The Rumanians will not falter,"
the king said, "in their allegiance to
the cause nor can the enemy wean
them from their faith in their allies.
Yet, the Rumanians pray that in spite
of their existing exigencies and their
own huge problems, the allies will
not allow the affairs of Rumania, who
has staked her all in thic conflict,
to pass into the back of their minds
and to suffer to such an extent that
she may meet the fate of either Bel
glum or Serbia."
King Ferdinand said that Rumania
had not been moved to enter tho war
by mere expediency, but that her de
cision was based on the biggest prin
ciples or nationality. "Against Ger
many,' continued his majesty, "there
was. at tho beginning of the war, no
hostility, rather perhaps friendship,
for economically Germany was an as
set to the development of our indus
try and a potent Instrument in for
warding the prosperity of our coun
try. But with tho progress of tho
war Rumanian began to teel the sub
tle force of enemy Intrigue endeav
oring in every way to force us into
the struggle against our own real in
terests. Position of Rumania.
"If Rumania has been criticised
heretofore let the world consider her
position. A small power with a small
army surrounded by giants faced a
practical problem. With a western
frontier nearly 700 miles long, which
alone was greater than the English
and French fronts combined, and Bul
garian frontiers, almost undefended
and near her capital, stretching for
other "hundreds of miles to the south,
she had to await the time when she
could act with reasonable assurance
of protecting herself and having the
support of her allies.
"A small country In a great war,
which promises to last for at least
another year, faces certain internal
sacrifice and the consumption of her
resources. But such is the confidence
of Rumania in the Jstlce of her
cause and the faith of her allies that
she has cast her lot with them In
the conviction that her great associ
ates will se that she does not provo
to be the third small power destroyed
in this great conflict.

Bakers, in reports to the bureau, gave
as reasons the increased coBt of ma

flour. Changes in prices and weights
havo been most numerous during the
last two months which the figures

Of 210 brands of bread that retailed

mained at tho same price and weight
on September 15.
Wheat and Flour.
Comparative "figures regarding
wheat and flour prices and the aver

in September tho wholesale price ot
wheat was 31 per cent greater on
September 15 than on May 15, the
wholesale price of flour 37 per cent
higher, the retail price 23 per cent
highpr for tho samo period, and tho
average retail price of bread was 11
per cent higher.
Another table shows the retail mar
gin of prices for flour and bread. In

In September the margin was $1.90 a
barrel. The retail price of bread per
pound before baking in May was $.056.
In September it was $.062. The whole
sale price of 10.45 ounces of flour in
one pound of bread before baking, as
suming 300 loaves to the barrel, In
May was $.01S. In September it was
$.025.
In May the wholesale value of 10.45
ounces of flour was l.S cents; the
average retail price for 16 ounces of
bread, before baking, being 5.6 cents,
