RETURNED MISSIONARY
TELLS SORROWFUL TALE—
MEXICAN PAPER DOLLAR
WORTH 2 CENTS GOLD.
El Paso, Tex., Oct. 13.—A Mex
ican prolestanl missionary, who
returned today from a visit to
central Mexico, declared that not
withstanding the sufferings of
the peons in the district Villa is
now preying on, they rise to a
man in Villa's behalf should the
American punitive expedition at
tempt to operate south of its
present base.
The missionary submitted this
report to his superiors. The re
port explained the peons fear and
liate of Villa, but they have been
taught to believe the Americans
would go after Villa only with
the masked purpose of seizing
and annexing the country.
In Zacatecas the missionary,
who is also a physician, declared
in his report, he examined men
lving in the street as if drunk,
finding them dying of starvation.
Women, lacking strength to
speak, implored him with their
eyes for alms. Children were
terribly emaciated.
Oilier Mexicans arriving at the
border confirm the missionary's
statements as to the decline in
value of Carranza money. Water
sellers at the railway stations
charge a paper dollar for a jar of
water. No water is supplied on
the cars. The paper dollar is
now down to 2 cents in gold.
JAMES SUBERT PASSED AWAY
At the hospital in Dickinson
Wednesday occurred the death of
James Subert, the result of the
effect of an ulcer of the stomach,
for which an operation was per
formed but proved of no avail.
Mr. Subert was born in Vernon
county, Wisconsin, January 24,
1877. He came to North Dakota
about seventeen years ago and
located on a homestead near Bur.
l:ey about ten years ago, where
he lived up until within a few
days of his demise. In 1911 he
married Miss Eva Southerly,
from which union three children
•were born. Besides a loving wife
and three children, he leaves to
mourn their loss an aged father
and mother and four brothers.
Mr. Subert was held in high
Esteem by all who know him and
'his demise is mourned by not on
ly relatives, but a vast number of
friends as well.
SLOPE COUNTY TAXES
WILL BE HIGH
Slope County News: A short
lime ago the News staled that the
taxes in Slope county would be
considerable lower because of the
action of the state board of equa
lization in making a 10 per cent
reduction on real estate and other
valuations. However, in spite of
this reduction, you are not likely
lo be startled by the reduction in
(he amount you will have to pay.
,,The assessors this year even un
der the much abused Jorgenson
schedule returned the valuation
of the county about one million
dollars less than last year. The
total valuation of Slope county
this year is $2,597,219 as against
more than three million dollars
last year.
And now -to raise the amount
of money necessary to run the
county for the next year the total
levy has been fixed at 28.3 mills
as against 22.6 mill's last year.
The limit has been levied on
lour of the county funds, as fol
lows:
(ieneral fund
Road fund 5 mills
Bridge fund 4 mills
Emergency fund 2 mills
EVERY VOTE ON THE SLOPE A

The other funds are as follows:
Sinking fund 1.7 mills
Seed grain 1.6 mills
Co. tuition fund 2 mills
The sum of each of these funds
added together makes 28,3 mills
for the county and stale funds.
Add this to your township and
school 'district levy and figure
what your taxes will be.

Elanley Oct. 9.—Ernest Gus.

coinmitled suicide by shooting at
the Gust Larson farm south of
Stanley. The deceased came over
from Sweden about two years
ago and had worked as a farm
laborer for Mr. Larson since early
spring. Not a great deal is knowrn
of his antecedents but he seemed
a man of thrift, having a sum of
money on deposit in one of the
local banks.
He was of a retiring and melan

CONTRACTS AWARDED
FOR 22 BRIDGES.
Slope County News: At the last
meeting of the board of county
commissioners held at Amidon
this week a contract for the build
ing of 22 bridges was awarded to
the Great Northern bridge Co. All
of these bridges were adberliscd
some lime ago but the contracts
were not let for the reason thai
no reasonable bids were received.
The great Northern Bridge Co.
was represented at the meeting by
W. E. Hewett, who contracted to
have all of these bridges complet
ed before January 1, 1917. He
says that he will put on three or
four crews of workmen and will
rush the work. All of the bridges
will be buiit upon steel piling.
Perhaps it is worth while not
ing that last year when the con
tract was let for the bridge across
tthe Missouri river at Marmarth
for some over $11,000 that a largo
number of voters were up in arms
and even though the county ad
vertised for bids in all of the
county papers and put the whole
contract through in legal form
the work was held up for months
in the courts. This week the com.
missioners let the contracts for
I he building of 22 bridges for
810,764 without advertising for
bids—and everybody is happy.
The comissioners are within their
lawful rights too, according to
some advice.
The commissioners consider
thai an emergency exists as they
had previously advertised to re.
reive bids and no reasonable bids
were put in. The scarcity of la.
bor and material and thcunecessi.
ty of building these bridges, are
the reasons given for their act
ions. The county will approv?
the action of the commissioners
still the laws are funny things,
don't you think so?
The members of the local lodge
Woodmen of the World are ear
nestly .requested to attend the
next regular meeting, to take
place on the evening of Thurs
day, October 19. Several'mailers
of importance will be taken up
and it is probable lhat an oyster
supper will be served.

MIRAGE SEEN FROM
ROLAND GRANT FARM.
Saturday morning last, the
members of the Roland Grant
(arm were surprised by the scene
spread before their eves in the
northeast. Apparently right in
front of them were Ihe cities of
Wibaux, Beach and Yales. The
vision was so clear lhat the Grants
could with case distinguish build
ings familiar lo them in the three
towns.
The atmosphere, it seems was
just right for the proper workings
of a mirage and Mr. Grant says it
was so clear that it startled him.

relief, whereby rights, there
shoulh be no towns.
These mirages are strange
things and to persons who have

SEAMAN SMITH.
When a sheriff has fullfilled
Ills promises made to the public
before election and discharges
the duties of his office in a sat
isfactory manner during his first
term, it is the custom for the peo
ple lo express their approval of
his official conduct by electing
him lo a second term. And only
when it is known or believed lhat
he has disgraced his office or fail
ed through incompetency, dis
honesty, neglect or partisanship
to properly serve the people is
he discarded after the first term.
The question therefore for
fairminded voters to consider
when voting for the sheriff is.
has Seaman Smith been a good
Sheriff. Has he been a compe
tent, honest officer, discharging
his duties in an efficient, busi
nesslike manner, independent of
any faction or political boss. His
record speaks for itself. And
that he is the kind of an official
that the people want is shown by
the fact that many who were for

Discussing this question, Mr.
Frazier necessarily dealt with

Nonpartisan league, and ils work,
maintaining that the present sys

is so unjust, lhat the farmers
banded together politically in
supporters.
When Seaman Smith was el

were sick and tired of factions,
factional fights and the rule

political bosses who were con
linually stirring up strife and ar

were tired of seeing Ihe officers
using their official power, which
the voters gave them, to perse

expense of the taxpayers. And he
believed one boss to be about
