1 he T. & I. Hall last Monday even-, ief t for Ann Arbor.Saturday evening,
injt iur vns renuinr mommy meeting
of the Boosters Club. It was quite
evident that there is no disposition on
the part of the business men of the
town to let this organization go to
pieces. There are good reasons why
it should not go to pieces; there has
never been an organization in Wau
seon that has brought the business
men and citizens so thoroughly together
in co-operative effort for the common
good and there are many things that
have been accomplished for the pro
gress and welfare of the community,
as well as many more that may be
accomplished, through . this organiza
tion as the medium.
Vice President Howe called ,the
meeting to order and the minutes of
th last meeting were read and ap
proved. The matter of the Joint meet
ing of Fulton County Pomona Grange
and The Boosters Club the latter part
of November was brought up for dis
cussion. The Grange will hold their
private session in the forenoon and
the joint meeting in the afternoon, in
which both Grange members and Boos
ters Club members will appear on the
' program. The tentative plan for the
day as it stands at present, is that the
Grange will meet in the forenoon at
T. and I. Hall and the joint meeting
will be held in the afternoon in the
High School Auditorium. The Boos
ters' Club suggest that the meeting
be held on Friday rather than on Sat
urday this suggestion is referred to
the Grange.
The Boosters' Club will entertain
, the Grange members at luncheon on
the day of the meeting. Motion pre
vailed "that the chair appoint a com
mittee of three to have general charge
of arrangements for the joint meet
ing with the Grange.
The Municipal Christmas Tree for
1916 was another matter that was
pretty thoroughly discussed and a
committee consisting of Superintend
ent M. L. Altstetter, Messers. Chas.
Jordan and Sam Ruppert, was ap
pointed to co-operate with the Civic
Club in arranging for Wauseon's Tree.
Mr. Clyde Wager who has been act
ing as secretary of the club, resigned
his office as First Vice President, the
resignation was accepted and the
Fresilent F. R. Guilford appointed
Mr. Wager as secretary and F. E.
Kenyon to act as First Vice President
In place of Mr. Wager. The next regu

From October Review of Reviews
(Non-Partisan)
In the case of the Anthracite Coal
Strike, President Roosevelt stood
firmly for arbitration as against ar
rogance on the part of the Companies,
and he carried his point. In this case
Presdent Wilson had the opportunity
to show equal firmness in standing
for arbitration when .the arrogance
was on the other side. In our judg
ment, such a stand would have
strengthened him, not only with the
general public but with organized la
bor itself. The thing that President
Wilson decided to do was to go to
Congress and demand the enactment
of a law for the benefit of one par
ticular set of men engaged in a pri
vate calling, under the threat on their
part that they would strike on Mon
day, the 4th, if the law were not pass-

written by an old friend were read at
the grave:
Sweet be the rest dear father,
After the toils of life,
Naught can disturb thy slumbers
No pain, no care, nor strife,
So many years have passed
Since first the light of day
Dawned bright upon thine infancy
And cheered thee all the way
No more cans't thou be with us,
But we will love thee still,
And bow in meek submission
To our kind father's will.

The secret of the honorable and suc
cessful administration of the Bank
ing Department under Governor Wil
lis is a very simple one; the depart
ment was conducted for the benefit
of the public not as a political ma
chine. The new order had no politi
cal debts to pay, no political grudges
to satisfy, no political dependents to
take care of. Therefore it 'did not
need to pad the pay rolls with super
fluous and incompetent employees;
and it did not need to "wreck banks to
find places for the faithful.
Fourteen banks were' closed in the
administration of Governor Cox. Only
one bank was closed in the adminis
tration of Governor Willis. This con
trast tells the story.- ;
In the first "year of Mr. Cox's ad
ministration $33,275.91 was taken
from - the depositors of failed insti
tutions and paid to Democratic liqui
dators, Democratic attorneys, Demo
cratic clerks. In the second year of
Mr. Cox's administration, $94,070.24
was paid out from depositors funds
to the same beneficiaries. In the
first year of Mr. Willis's administra
tion, $11,375.50 was paid for con
tinuing the liquidation of these failed
institutions. In the second year of
the Willis administration up to Sep
tember first, $5,315.43 was paid. Two
years of Mr. Cox cost . depositors
$127,346.15. Almost two years of
Mr. Willis cost depositors only $16,
673.03. Because failed banks were
administered for the benefit of de
positors, not of political heelers, the
Willis administration spent one dol
lar here the Cox ' administrtaion
spent seven.
. The liquidation of the one bank
that failed in the Willis administra
tion, The German-American Commer
cial & Saving Bank, of - Cincinnati,
tells the same story and works out
at about the same 'ratio. Under Mr.
Cox, failed banks :were kept in the
field managed by expensive political
liquidators and their political coun
sel and subject to rentals and other
incidentals for periods from half a
year up to two years. Under Mr. Wil
lis, the ajfairs of the failed Cincin
nati institution were brought into the
department in sixty days. The aver
age cost of liquidating a failed bank
under Mr. Cox was about $7,000.00.
The probable complete cost of liqui
dating the Cincinnati bank will be
not more than $1,000.00. . . "
