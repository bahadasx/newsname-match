which severai weeks ago *. r.3 told of
the part a woman agent of the govern?

But hcrewith is printed for the first

story. That story has stirred the quiet
village of Lake George. The unconven

missed by postoffice Inspectors ai "no

natur-a of the case against young Haw?
ley, his previous good record and the
standing of his father bave united to
gain sympathy for the accused man.
So concerned has Lake George beer. j
during the last week in its protest

facts of the robbery are these:
On the evening of August 22, just as
night was falling, a trolley car en

VENIZELOS WHalT
WAR ON BULGARS
Will Form Army?Attacks
King's Prussian
Policy
London, Oct. 13 (Friday).?Tho n?wi
papers to-day publish an interview
granted Ward Price, the official British
press representative, by Eleutherios
Venizelos at Salonica, in which the
forrner Premier denounced King Con
stantine as responsible for the present
state of affairs in Greece and outlined
further plans for the provisional gov
tmment, which include the raising of
an army corps to fight on the side of
the Entente Allies against the Bul
garlans.
In the interview Venizelos declared
that it was the intention of himself
and his collaborators to set up a for
mal government in Salonica, exercising
all powers of state, "levying existing
taxes to maintain the military service
and raise and equip troops."
Venizelos said that when in Septem?
ber, 1915, ho urged upon the King the
r.ecessity of fultilling Greece's treaty
obligations with Serbia King Constan
tine replied:
"I am prepared to leave the internal
affain of Greece to the government,
but in international relations I con
sidcr myself alone responsible before
God for their direction."
Venizeloa Repliea to King.
"M. Venizeloa said ho replied to the
King:
"'You are enunciating the doctrine
of the divine right of kir.gs, with which
we have nothing to do in Greece.
Your father was freely elected by the
Greek people to be their King, and
you are hi* successor. There is no di?
vine right in that title. It Ifl based
on the mandate of the people.'
"Clearly King Constantino ha*
stepped outside the limits of the Greek
constitution," Venizelos eontinued.
"What lifla at the root of the King's at- j
titude is that he regards the Kmgdom
of (ireece as his own personal prop'-rty.
"That is the Frussian theory of king
ship. We cannot recognize it in
Greaea. Tho result of the King's Idea
of his right has been that we have
tom up 'he treaty with Serb.a, that
we are dishonoreu. that we have lost
tfl-flfl- with our old friends, F.ngl.nd,
Fraace and Russia, and that our heredi
tary enemies have invaded our terri- ;
tory, occupied our towna and pillaged
our peopl..."
A eommunication i*sued by the
f-reek government yesterday, reeiting
ihe demands made by Admiral d'Artige

New Neutrality Patrol
Catches Britisher
in Harbor
The first vessel to be turned baek
by a newly established naval neutral?
ity patrol was the British steamship
City of Madras, whieh was overhauled
off Ambrose Lightship at 8 o'clock last
night by the United States destroyer
Sterett The steamer was eonroyed
baek to a point off Clifton, Staten Isl?
and. where Captain William Grey was
ordered by the naval officers to remain
at anchor until this morning. The
charge for whieh the boat is being held
is failure to ohey an order of a United
States warship on patrol duty.
It was said at Quaruntine late last
night that the City of Madra3 would
be permitted to sail this morning, as
her clcarance pnpers are correi t.
Thc City of Madras. of 3,015 tons
burden, cleared Monday for Singapore,
Manila and Ilong Konj, but anchored
above Quarantine, prosurnably for the
reasnn that a submarine attack was
feared if she ventured out. As she
pas*ed Quarantine Bt 7 o'clock last
nijrht Captain Grey was hailed by the
government patrol tug I'ahadon and
ordered to stop.
Instead of complyinfr, the City of
Madras, full stcam ahead, made for the
lower bay. The Pahadon followed as
far as Norton's Point in an effort to
overUke her, but was outdistanced. Tho
tug put baek and the Sterett also sig
naled the vessel to stop, firing a blank
shot when she failed to comply. The
destroyer then raced down Ambrose
Channel at a speed of twenty-five knots,
cvertaking tho steamer as she wa*
abreast of the lightship.
No Explanatlon of Action
Heretofore when vessels have been
brought baek for a minor violation flf
the international code they have been
permitted to leave again almost im
mediately. Officers of the navy yard
disclaimed knowledge of the reason for
the Sterett'b action and would venture
no opinion as to why the vessel i? be?
ing deUined.,.. .
First dellnlte information that the
neutrality patrol already had been es?
tablished wa* brought earlier in the
day by Captain McDonald, of the Mun
amar, of the Munson Line,, whieh ar?
rived from Central American ports. A
destroyer appeared out of the fog at 6
o'clock off the Atlantic coast and encir
cled the Munamar several times, evi
dently trying to establish her identity.
When the Stars and Stripes wer run up
the destroyer departed.
Three Destroyere Leave Newport
Three destroyers left N%w-port Har?
bor late in the afternoon at full speed,
and others were getting up stcam and
making other preparations fcr leaving
on patrol dutv. From unofficial sources
it was learn.-d that the three whieh
left -the Jarvis, Drayton and ranning
- are bound for the coast of Maine. in
the vicinity of Bar Harbor. Kear Ad?
miral Aufltifl M. Knight, commandant
of the Nairagansett Hay naval station,
would not disrlose the nature of their
errand, nor even admit that a patrol
had been established but txvrauad^
view that one would be in effect with?
in a short time."
Patrol Plans Extensive
The plans of the .Navy Department
for maintaining the patrol are exten?
sive, taking in the entire destroyer
force, aetive and reserve, light cruts-.'s,
navy tuRs and other auxiliary cralt.
The' obiect of the patrol, it is under?
stood, will be not only to protect. Amer?
ican t.-rritonal waters. but also to
prevent the establUhmcnt of seeret
baae* flflhoia and the eoBnannicatton
between shore radio stations and lel
ligerent craft at nea.
Vanous obstacles are snid to have
been encountered to the ongina. plan
of also mabilisiBg the force of pn
vately owned motorboats, whieh have
been enrolled with their crews as a
part of the naval reserve.
Americans on Adriatic
Sailing Dcspite U-Boats
With sll light* extinguis'ned, the;
steamship Adriatic, of the White Star
Line, carrylBg Iti pa<rrngers, includ-.
ing Americans. and ln.OOO tons of war
munitions, was believed last night to
be speeding south from this port, well
within the three-mile zone. of safety
off the New Jersey coast.
Her announced destination was Liver
pool, ?nd her regular course to that
city would lead east from Sandy Hook.
She apparently followed in the wake flf
the freight-laden Pannonia and Min
nehaha. The Danish vessel HelligOlnv.
more venturesome than the British
..teBmer.s, took tho easterly course Bfter
clearing tho bar.
They were the Bfflt vessels to leave
Nflw York for EuropflBB ports since thc
submnrine raid flf Baaday. %?'verH'

regiatrr, aailfld later in the day.
The Adrintic left her dock yesterday
afternoon, but after renchiiig Sandy
Hook dropped anchor flutflidfl the bar.
Her captain evidently intended to get
?way under rover flf darkness. As
night fell no lightfl flashed aboard the
big liner, aml Sandy Hook ohservers
were unable to watch her movement*.
It was believed, however. that Bhe
headed south soon after 7 o'clock.
No WarBhipa Sighted
No British or French cruisers whieh
might act aa convoya were lightfld. fll
though lt was believed they might pick
up the liner after ahe was forced to
ih ave the three-mile limit. It waa

HUGHES HITS
AT PRESIDENT
ON LUSITANIA
A Firm Stand Would
Have Prevented
Outrage
fTT<".m a Stiflf Corrwpen 1*nt nt T:? MBflfln]
Louisville, Oct. 12. Warnings, sueh
as were issued before the Lusitania
was sunk, would have been answered
by Hughes as Fresident, he declared to
day, in terms so unmistakable that the
ship would not have been torpedoed.
The government issuing sueh warnings,
he said, would have been given to un
derstand that friendly relations could
not continue if the threat was carried
out.
The vaunted campaign question was
fired at Mr. Hughes in the midst of
one of the most riotous and disordcrly
meetings that any candidate for Fres?
ident ever faced. Phoenix Hill I'ark
Hall was cramnied. Mr. Hughes had
given a Democratic hccklcr a forth
right answer to a question concern?
ing his veto of the two-cent railroad
far. bill in New York.
Gets Hearing for Hecklcr
"The path of peare ls the path of
self-respect," he had started to say a
few seconds later, "which maintains
the dignity of our citizenship and ce
ments the friendship of all nations."
An individual in a flag-draped bal?
cony leancd lar o\er the rail and
t-houted:
"Justice Hughes, just a moment,
please. Fermit a rcspectful inter
luption. What would you have
done"-(Cries of "I'ut him out!"
interrupted the questioner.;
"Please let the question be asked,"
insisted Mr. Hughes. "1 desire I -
question to be asked. Please ask .tt"
'?I ask >ou with all respect that I
know, what you would nave done, when
the Lusitania was 6unk? See if you
can answer thi.a."
Would Have Had Respect
The crowd j.-er-d. Mr. Hughes
silenceI them. Then said:
"I wil' answer this now, permit me
to answer it permit me to answer it.
Sir, I would have had the State De
partment, at th. very beginninaj of the
Administration, fo equipped as u> com?
mand the respect of the world."
The crowd yelled approval. He con
tirued, despite the bcdlam:
"Kindly wait till I get through, and
do not interrupt with applause until I
have answered the gentleman's ques?
tion. I have said that I would have had
the Stato Department equipped so as to
command the respect of the world at
the outset of the Administration; and,
next, I would have so conducted affairs
in Mexico as to show that our words
meant peaee and good will, to the pro?
tection at all events of the lives and
property ot* Ameriean citizens.
"And next, and next- when I said
'striet accountability' every nation
would have known that that was meant;
and, further, when notice was pub
lishcd with respect to the action threat
ened, I would have made it known in
terms unequivocable and unmistakable
that we should not tolerate a continu
ance of friendly relations through the
ordinary diplomatic ehannfllfl ll that
action were taken; and the Lusitania,
sir, would never have been sunk.
The tumult that greeted his state?
ment almost brok,- up the meeting. It
was miaatea befflra he could go on
with his speech. The man in the bal?
cony was almost mobbed.
Attacks "New Freedom"
Mr Hughes a = sni!ed President Wilson's
pet theorv, "The New I-'reedom," to-night.
He iatarprated it Ifl turn in the light
of each of the principal activities of
the Democratic adminiatration. In the
pasaaga of the Adamson railroad *TB_.
bill, Mr. Hughes d-elarcd. the W llson
doctrine became Tha BBfl" slavery -

SALOON MEN BLAMED
FOR BAYONNE RIOTS
Police Inspector Cady and
his squad yesterday lined up
a do/en saloonkeepers at the
point of rifles and said:
"Vou fellows were ordered
to close two days ago and
you didn't do it. You've
been selling your vile whiskey
to these strikers and causing
most of this trouble. ^ou
seem to want violenee, so, all
right. We're going to give it
to you."
One by one, Inspector
Cady's men smashed their
way into nearly a dozen sa
loons. Hundreds of bottles
of whiskey crashed to the
floor and their contents
streamed beneath the doors
into the gutters. Beer taps
were turned on and the con?
tents of many kegs foamed
out to join the alcoholic

ATTEWPTS TO

Sherrill Tells of Effort
to Block Defence
Parade
The controvcrsy over the charges
mnde by Norman Hapgoo.l that Charles
K. Hughes had an understanding with
thc German propagandista increased
? yesterday.
Colonel f harles H. Sherrill. who MM
\ gnr.lred the big prtparednesa parade on
1 May 11 laat, added strength to the Re?
publican eounter-charge that it was the
' Democrats who had been most aetivfl
in trying to get the German-American
vote. He declared an attempt was made
by the Administration to prevent the
parade on the ground that it might
cause trouble among New York's Ger
man-Americans.
A signed statement to that effect was
nade by Colonel Sherrill Bt Republican
national headquarters. Colonel Sherrill
declared he was summoned to the
Mayor's offict two weeks before the
parade and was there told of a message
from Washington. The statement was
supported by Alderman Henry H. Cur
! ran and others, who were in Mayor
Mitchel's office during the interview.
It was made elear that the suggestion
! did not come from the Mayor, but from
? Washington, Mr. Sherrill said.
Was Afraid of Riots.
| The statement in part follows:
"About two weeks before the parade
j I received an urgent telephone request
! to come to the Mayor's office. Upon
j arrival there I was told that a long dis
. tance telephone message had just been
i received from the Administration in
; Wrshington urging that the prepared
' ness parade be abandoned on the ground
i that it would irritate our American
citizens of German birth or descent,
might cause riots in the streets, and
i therefore be most undesirable.
"Of course, I was astounded by this
' request, and stated that, in my opin?
ion, side-stepping a crisis was not the
best way to meet it, especially if not
, assured that it really was a crisis. I
asked time to consider the matter, ar.d
'< it was given me. It was made elear
' that the extraordinary suggestion did
r.ot originate with the Mayor, but came
from the Administration in Washing?
ton.
Found Danger Imaginarv
"In order to asrertain if thl* was a
real or only an imaginary crisis, pre?
pared for poiitical purposes, I con
ferred with Carl L. Schurz, a child
hood friend, told him what had been
' said to me at the Mayor's office, ex
pressed my opinion that it was based
upon an entire misconception of our
(.erman-American citizens and their
lowaltjr to their adopted land, and in
this opinion he heartily ajrreed. He
went at once to see his friend.-. and had
a ntimher of conferences, concerning
whieh I cannot speak. because I was
not pre.aent at any of them.
"I learned that. as a result of his
?ffortfl, r.ernard Ridder purposely went
1 to thc Mayor's office and assured his
honor that not only was there no fear
of any rioting or other disloyal be
havior on the part of American citi?
zens of German antecedents, but also
' thflt the (ierman language nrea.s of this
city would indorse and bupport the
paradfl. I myaelf never have seen Bcr
nurd Ridder."
Wilson Emisaarr Present
It was underrtood that a spokesman
from the President was in the Mayor's
office when Mr. Sherrill called. Mr.
Sherrill would not say who he was. but
rafarrfld inquirers to the Mayor. From
other sources it was learned that Frank
' L. Polk, counsellor to the Statfl De?
partment, waa the man.

Appeal for Protection
Twice within six hours yesterday sovcnty-five special police?
men. detectives and firemen, armed with shotguns, clubs and
rcvolvers, deseended on the Constable Hook district of Bayonne,
N. J.. and battled with the Standard Oil strikers.
During the first raid, in the afternoon, one man was killed
and eight persons were shot, two so seriously they are expected
to die. As a resuft of the second battle, last night, ono striker
is dying in the Bayonne City Hospital, and another, carried away
by his comrades, is believed to have been fatally wounded.
Citizens See Police March
The reign of terror that has held Bayonne in its grip for
two days and nights reached its crest late yesterday afternoon,
when 3,000 of the city's residents, surrounding Police Headquar?
ters, in Twenty-sixth Street, saw nearly one hundred armod
men, most of them in uniform, march forth, the leaders with
rifles and repeating shotguns on their shoulders, the others
armed with clubs and heavy revolvers.
Word had spread to the strike district that the little army
of police was coming to clean up the Hook. Lurking in doorways
and alleys, strikers awaited their advance, with rifles and re?
volvers, ready to drop the first bluecoat they saw. When tho
squad went forward there followed a combat that turned tho
sometime peaceful streets of Bayonne into a battlefield and
made the air resound for two hours with the recurrent cracking
of rifle, shotgun and revolver shots.

Organized Mob Makes
Surprise Attack?Many
Passengers Hurt
Rioting of a sort not experieneed by
the police at the worat stage* of the
car strike occurred shortly before mid
night last night in Harlem. Before it
; wcs put down by the reserves from
three precincts ten cars were badly
damaged. night service on the lines was
discontinued and a score of men and
women were injured by stones and pa
I trolmcn'a clubs. Thrco arresti were
l made. I
With a suddenness that took the
police unawares, 1,500 men, women and
I boys spread along Madison Avenue
I from ll.th to 118th Street and through
I 116th Street from Park to Fifth Ave
inue. At a given signal missiles of
every deacription were hurled at cars
of the Fourth and Madlaon^Lenox and
Lexington Avenue and 116th Street
crosstown lines.
The motormen put on ipeed and
' dashed through the ranks of the rioters.
1 men, women and children passengers
threw themselves on the floors as wln
! dows and woodwork wer. iplintered
1 and shattered.
The calm of the last week or two had
1 given the police confidence that the
j violent part of the strike was over. One
' patrolman was on duty on each car, but
! no extra details of men were patrolling
, the car lines. .
The gathering of so many people ap
parentlv did not cause any anxiety to
the few policemen on duty, and when
the attack commenced the police were
utterly unable to cope with the situa?
tion. . .,
. At the height of the trouble some
person tired six shots from a revolver,
but the police doubted that any one
had been struck. Occupants of tene
ment BOUflfll on all sides aided the
strikers and threw bricks and other
missiles on the heads of the police.
In arrestmg a man who said he was
Michael Carroll, forty-eight, of Bl
Fast 126th Street, Sergeant Mangin
i was thrown to the ground by a ?ym
' pathizer. The two men wrestled about.
and m the struggle some one kicked
Mangin on the hand, tearing the flesh.
He held onto his prisoner, however.
The other prisoners described them?
selves as Herman Adier, of 229 East
110th Street, and Nathan Burger. a
striking conductor, of ?".'J9 Kaat Twelfth
i_t.reet. Burger and Carroll were lorked
up in the Fast 126th Street station.
Adler was taken to the Children _ So?
ciety.
