TRUE CITIZENSHIP.
William Howard Tnft is among tho
foremost lawyers of this country. His
knowledgo of the theory and practice
of jurisprudence is as great as any man
ins and whatever ho has to say on the
legal aspect of citizenship must bo tak'
en ns tho pronouncement of an export
It was no surprise, therefore, when he
stated in an address at Adams, Mass.,
Sunday night that the highest antl best
citizenship consists In a broad view of
tho political and economic situation.
'The greatest good for the greatest
number" is tho primo and only con
sidcration that has a right to claim in
ilticncc over tho citizen in tho exercise
of his sacred privilege of casting his
ballot, according to Mr. Taft's view,
and ho is right.
This kind of citizenship is tho kind
that is'worth while nnd upon it rests
tho security of tho republic. Individ
ual interest has no proper place in the
oting booth, in the scrvico of tho pub
lie, nor in tho privileges of citizenship
and ns Mr. Taft truly says, tho man
who has tho sacred right to participate
iu the government is exercising a trus
tocship for thoso who cannot vote, who
constitute n vast majority of tho nv
habitants of this country.

It is almost impossible to find boys
for ollico or shop work. Ono New York
paper published this week 11 columns
of "Boy Wanted" advertisements;
flio main reason for tho shortage is
that with tlio present high rato of
wages tho unskilled but fairly strong
boy con cam in almost any rough work
wages as largo ns thoso his father re
ceived a fow years ago. Tho result is
that boys nro unwilling to start in oc
cupations where tho wages aro small,

something which will fit them for ad
vancement in tlio coming years. Tho
boys who put asido tho temptation of

in talking about submarino operations
in uccoi dance with intei national law it is
well to remember tlmt all the interna
tional law that we liavo was fiamed before
any submarines went into actual war ser
vice. If tho German undersea boats car-
lied their operations along the Atlantic
coast to the extent that merclmutsliips
were forced for safety's sake to remain in

to n blockade, I-nw seems to thu layman

FINED 350 -FOR ABDUCTION.
Warrant Sworn Out Against Smith' by
Mother of Girl He Accompanied to
Brattleboro.
Charged with abduction, YJcorge Smith
22, of South Hadley Falls, was taken into
custody by tho police Friday night. His
arrest followed his elopment to iirattic
boro Thursday with Irene Senville,-15, oi
Holyoko in an unsuccessful attempt to get
married. Smith had started work Fri
day for the Holyoke Street Railway com
pany, when the police arrested him on a
warrant sworn out by tho girl's mother.
On Wednesday ho was found guilty in
a secret session of the police court on a
charge of abduction and lined $50.
Smith and the Senville girl had been
keeping company for about five weeks and
tho mother was opposed to their court
ship, it is claimed. Tho girl's motboi
went to work in .a Holyouc mill and latci
the daughter left home to go to work in
a storo. Smith met her on the way and
the Brattleboro trip was the result. Tin
girl's absence from work caused her em
ployer to notify her mother and it was
learned that the couple had left the city
The mother notified the police.
Smith admitted Friday to tho police
that the elopement had been contemplated
several days. The girl called on a lawyer
and sought advice about taking Mich a step
and Smith also interviewed the same at
torney. Smith admitted that the attor
ney "had informed him that he would get
himself into trouble if he took the girl out
of the stato and sVore falsely to her age.
The girl was told the same thing and
both were given sound advice as to the
folly of the scheme they had planned.
However, Smith was willing to take his
chances with the result that the police
have stepped in as ho was advised might
surely bo the case if he went ahead with
his plans.

SUNK OFF NANTUCKET
ive Merchantships Sent to Bot
tom by German Submarino
No Lives Wcro Lost and All tho Rules
of International Law Wero Observed
by Raldor.
The German submarine war faro was
brought to the American coast on Sun
dtiy, when three British, ono Dutch
and one Norwegian steamer weio tor
pedoed and sent to tho bottom oil Nan
tucket shoals.
On Saturday, the German submarino
U-53 surprised naval officials by ap
pearing in tlio harbor at Newport, It.
I. The visitor remained thero only
thrco hours, took on no supplies and
asked for no assistance. Tho only er
rand was to send ashore a special let-
or to the German ambassador at
Washington.
The five ships torpedoed wcro trav
eling in the direct path taken by all
tho trans-Atlantic liners. Tho victims
of the submarines wcro as follows:
Strathdenc, a British freighter; West
Point, also a British freighter; tho
Stophauo, a British passenger liner,
plying regularly between New York,
Halifax and St. Johns, N. F.: tho
Bloomcrsdijk, a Dutch freighter; tho
Christian Knudscn, a Norwogian
freighter.
Not a life- was lost, and the subma
rines observed in every way the terms
of international law, giving duo warn
ing and allowing the passengers and
crew to leave tho vessels before this
torpedoes wero fired.
.News of the attack was sout out by
wireless and torpedo boat destroyers
and other vessels from Newport bur
ned to tho scene to give every pos
sible aid. Tho Stcphano carried 140
persons, including passengers and
crows. There wcro no pnssengers on
tho other vessels. Tho Bloomcrsdijk
carried a crew of 50 men and a cargo
of grain valued at ono half a million,
consigned to the government or tho
Netherlands, and the vessol was val
ued at $1,500,000.
The people aboard the several ships,
who put to sea in open boats, wore
picked up by several vessels and
brought to Newport, R. I.
Tho American steamer Kansan,
bound from New York for Genoa with
iteol. for. tho Italian "government, was
stopped by a submarine. After hor
papers had been examined, sbo was al
lowed to proceed into Boston harbor
for her usual call thero.
Tho Kansan reported that the sub
marine which she' met was radically
different in typo from the U-53. This
leads to the belief that two, or pos
sibly three, submarines were engaged
in the attacks ou tho merchant vessels.
On Monday, tho news was sent out
that niue ships were destroyed and
that threo submarines at least wcro in
the vicinity of Nantucket. This report
was proved later to bo erroneous. Tho
ubmarinc scare had created quito a
(lurry in stock markets Monday, stand
ard and war issues falling from five
to 18 points a share. Many vessels
bound for European ports have been
held up in New York to deterniino
whether the under-sea operations aro
to bo continued on this sido of tho At
lantic. It was reported that a steamer
Kingston or Kingstoninn had also been
struck and the United States naval do
stroyors searched for her crow threo
days, but did not find any traco of
them and it is now believed that no
such vessel was near Nantucket at tho
time of tho attacks.
No trace of any German submarino
has been found sinco Sunday nnd
American naval officers aro of the bo-
lief that tho U-53 started immediately
for tlio German naval baso at Helgo
land after tho five ships wero sunlf.
RED SOX WON SERIES.
Final Game Against Brooklyn Playod
Yesterday Afternoon.
The Boston Americans' are again
world champions, having beaten tho
Brooklyn Nationals four games out of
livo in the series which opened jn Bos
ton Saturday and ended there yesterday
in a 4-1 victory. Tho scores of tlio oth
er games wero as follows: Saturday,
Boston 0, Brooklyn 5; Monday, Boston
2, Brooklyn 1, 14 innings; Tuesday,
Brooklyn 4, Boston 3, at Brooklyn; Wed
nesday, Boston 0, Brooklyn 2, at Brook
lyn. It was clearly demonstrated in tho
sorics that Boston had the better pitch
ers. Tho American icaguo team had n
shade hotter of hitting, especially on
totals, and bhowed great skill in sacri
ficing. Boston also fielded moro clean
ly than its opponents. Tho most spec
tacular work was that of Monday when
Gainer, pinch hitter, with n clean 'sin
gle to the outfield, brought McNally
running for Hoblitzol home with tho
winning score.
