COTTONWOOD ON
SUNSHINE WAY
North and South Road to be
Important Link in Highway
From Mexico to Canadian
Line.
The Christian Science Daily
Monitor, published at Boston,
Mass., announces that the Na
tional Highways association has
approved the route of a highway
from Nogales, Ariz., on the Mex
ican border, to the Canadian line
near Marcus, the north and south
Idaho highway being a link in
the system which will be known
as the Sunshine Way. The Bos
ton publication publishes a map
of the route, which extends in an
almost direct northerly route the
entire distance. The points di
rectly served are shown to be as
follows:
Nogales, Pheonix, Prescott,
Ariz.; Needles, Cal.; St. George,
Beaver, Utah; Ely, Mizpah,
Cobre, Nevada; Twin Falls, Boise,
W e i s e r, Council, Meadows,
Whitebird, Grangeville, Cotton
wood, Lewiston, Idaho, and
Uniontown, Pullman, Colfax,
Spokane and Colville, Wash.
The article in the Monitor ac
companying the map explains
that this route will take the
traveler in close proximity to
the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado, to the great Salt Lake, to
the Shoshone Falls and then
through the interesting north
Idaho region with its lakes and
rivers and mountains and garden
spots. The route is classed as
one of the most attractive of
the entire system of national
Highways and will exert material
developement influences on the
great stretches of the "country
traversed.
In adopting this Sunshine high
way as a part of the National
Highways association will urge
its construction by the federal
government in sections where
sparse settlement would deny
local interests meeting the ex
pense. Toward this end the
national Highways association is
now urging that this highway
be given precedence in the
matter of the disbursement of
present federal funds appro
priated by the last congress for
good roads construction in asso
ciation with the states and com
munities.
As the Idaho state highway
commission has already endorsed
the north and south road as the
highway to be given precedence
in road-building under the feder
al corporation plan, it can be
a reality probably before large
stretches of the road in .other
states can be constructed, al
though these other states are
now busy in all plans relating to
the work.
The development again brings
to forcible attention the import
ance of the north and south high
way, independent of its direct
influence in opening state re
sources. It is now noted that
tne highway will be a link in the
national system for international
travel between Mexico and Can
ada, while it also becomes a unit
in the ^eastern and western
national highway routes. Esti
mate is made that during the
summer just passed, no less than
five hundred tourist cars from
the east were routed through
Oregon after reaching southern
Idaho due to the fact that no
route was open to this part of
the state. After traversing
great stretches of the plains sec
tion of the west, the traveler
would eagerly welcome the
change through the Idaho moun
tains to the north, but the ab
sence of an attractive highway
forbids. The north and south
road now being constructed will
remove this barrier, and con
ditions would indicate that the
road is destined to accom
modate when completed thous
ands of tourists every year.—

Asker Buys More Land
A deal was closed here Wed
nesday whereby Simon Bros,
sold their 360-acre farm south of
town to L. M. Asker, taking in
on the deal the residence proper
ty of the latter in the south end
of town (the old Creelman resi
dence.) While the consideration
of the deal was not made public
it is known that a very tidy price
was paid for the farm, which
now gives Mr. Asker in the
neighborhood of 1500 acres of
land in this vicinity. About 100
acres of the land purchased is
tillable, the rest being pasture.
The land is particularly valuable
to Mr. Asker for the reason that
it gives him necessary pasture
for his cattle, of which he has
quite a herd. Simon Bros,
bought the place several years
ago and have used it in connec
tion with their butcher business,
grazing their beef cattle there
until ready for market and farm
ing the land in cultivation.

WHAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY
DID TO AVERT STRIKE DISASTER
Before I consulted with them (the railroad executive« and repre
sentatives of the employees) I made myself acquainted with the
points at controversy.
The first thing I told both sides was that I stood for the eight
hour day. We believe In the eight hdur day because a man does
better work within eight hours than he does In a more extended day.
I said to the railroad executives: "You are asking that the result of
the eight hour day be predicted, and the prediction be arbitrated. The
reasonable thing to do Is to grant the eight hour day, not because
the men demand It, but because It is right, and let me get authority
from Congress to appoint a commission to observe the results and
report. In order that Justice may be done the railroads In respect of
the cost of the experiment."
That was the proposal which they rejected and which Congress
put Into law, a proposal which I made to them before 1 conferred
with It, which I urged upon them at every conference and which,
when the one side rejected and the other accepted, I went to Con
gress and asked Congress to enact. I did not Mk either lide
whether it inited them, and I requested toy friends in Congress
not to ask either side whether it suited them. I learned before
the controversy began that the whole temper of the legislative
body was in favor of the eight hour day.
In the House of Beprcsentatlves the plan was passed, was sanc
tioned, by a vote which Included seventy Républicain as against
fifty-four Republicans. In the Senate the Republican members held
a conference In which they determined to put no obstacle In the way
of the passage of the bill. Now this was because the proposal was
reasonable and was based upon right-From President Wilton't Speech

Gov. Alexander to Speak Here
Governor M. Alexander will talk to the voters of Cotton
wood and vicinity at the K. C. hall next Tuesday evening at É
o'clock and every man and woman in this vicinity should heat
him. Gov. Alexander is coming prepared to tell the voter*
exactly how the state's business is being run and you owe it
to yourself to hear him.
There will be other candidates present. Don't forget the
time and date.
Paid $30,000 For
The Collins Crop
Uniontown, Oct. 5.— O. M.
Collins, prominent farmer of the
Uniontown section, today sold to
the Vollmer-Clearwater company
a portion of his 1916 crop and
some old grain left from last year
the consideration being approx
imately $30,000. It is understood
the bulk of the wheat was pur
chased for the Lewiston Milling
company, the purchase having
been made by Robert Abel, rep
resentative of the Vollmer-Clear
water company. The price paid
per bushel is not made public,
but is stated about 25,000 bushels
of wheat were involved in the
deal.
Mr. Collins is one of the larg
est farmers of the Uniontown
section and has farm lands on
the Nezperce and Camas prairies.
It is estimated the value of his
1916 crop will be considerably in
excess of $50,000.
(Mr. Collins is president of the
First National Bank at this place
and also owns several fine farms
in Lewis county besides his hold
ings in the Uniontown and
Genesee sections.— Ed.)
The second annual Columbus
Day ball given last night at the
K. C. hall was one of the social
events of the season and was im
mensely enjoyed by all present.
The crowd was just the right
size, the music provided by the
Reubens 5-piece orchestra was
par excellence, and everyone
seemed out for an enjoyable time
and had it. The supper was also
beyond compare.
TO THE VOTERS OF IDAHO COÇNTY.
Since our nomination for Senator and Representatives
on the Democratic ticket, we have received numerous inqui
ries as to our position on Randall county. We have there
fore prepared the following statement:
That our candidacies are not in the interests of Randall
County and that if we are elected, we will not introduce or
support any measure having as its ultimate purpose the cre
ation of Randall county, or any new county, no matter by
what name known, out of the territory formerly known and
intended to be known as Randall County.
N. B. PETTI BONE, Candidate for State Senator.
JOHN T. QUINLAN, Candidate for Representative.
W. B. HUSSMAN, Candidate for Representative.
Local Company
Does Big Business
Geo. S. Downer, manager of
the Farmers Union Warehouse
Co ; gavfe us a slight idea this
week of the magnitude of his
company's operations here when
he informed us that he had
checked out more than $270,000
through the local banks within
the past four months. Most of
this amount was paid out for the
purchase of grain and hogs and
gives a slight idea of the im
mense value of the crops mar
keted at this place each year.
The largest check issued by
Mr. Downer called for $9,196.90
and was given to L. S. Fortin,
residing southeast of town, when
the later sold his grain crop re
cently.
Lewis Hacker is in the city to
day from Ilo.
M. H. Baulch was in the city
yesterday from Grangeville.
E. D. Lamb brought us some
sample apples and potatoes this
morning from his farm north of
town that are fine enough to
make a dyspeptic's mouth water.
They would surely have won a
prize if shown at the fair last
week.
The picture show next Tuesday
evening will start promptly at
6:30 and run once, in order to
have the hall available for Gov.
Alexander at 8 o'clock. If you
wish to see the third installment
of the great serial, "The Secret
of the Submarine," be there on
time.

Lafe Yates For Sheriff
A new political announcement
appears in this issue of the En
terprise. Mr. Yates is not mak
ing a very strenuous campaign.
In fact he is so busy making the
county a good sheriff that he has
not time to look after his cam
paign. We are of the opinion
that Mr. Yates' record should be
enough campaign for him. There
is no doubt that he has made the
best sheriff Idaho county has
ever had, and that is saying a
good deal, for Idaho county has
had some good sheriffs, but the
record of criminals run down and
convicted has never been equaled
and as a consequence we are en
joying a season of as little crime
as has been the good fortune of
its citizens since the earliest
history of the county. That pub
lic nuisance, the cattle and horse
thief, has been either put in the
penitentiary or scared into being
a good citizen and we believe
that as long as Lafe Yates re
mains in the sheriff's office there
will be very little stock rustling.

Mr. Henderson informed us that
they have had much «better re

keeping them in pasture instead
of on the open range. They have
a large 3,000-acre pasture under

they have several 3-year-old
steers in the bunch that will tip
