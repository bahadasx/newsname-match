WILSON SAVED
FARMERS FROM
GREAT CALAMITY
By Taking Only Way Possible
to Avert Immediate Paralysis
of Nation's Transportation.
BY FRANK G. ODELL.
Member Executive Committee Farm?
ers' National Congress and Edi?
tor Nebraska Farm Magazine.
The farmers of America have just
facd a crisis from which they have
been delivered by' prompt action by
the President of the United States.
It is the purpose of this article to call
their attention to a condition which
they have fortunately escaped.
For approximately three months in
the summer of 1910 the country was
faced a crisis from which they have
wide railway strike. The railway
managers and representatives of
"The Bijt Four" brotherhoods, rep?
resenting all the railroads of the
United States and their 400,000 em?
ployed in train service, were dead?
locked in a controversy over hours
of labor nnd wage schedules. About
the middle of August a crisis was
imminent. President Wilson volun?
teered to act as meditator in the in?
terest of the public. His efforts were'
unavailable because legislation look- \
ing toward the settlement of all in- j
dustrial disputes, began by this Dem-'
ocrutic Congress, had not yet gone,'
far enough: the President had no i
power to force arbitration. An im?
passe was again reached. The broth?
erhoods issued a si like order to be!
effective on Labor Day, Sept. 4.
The railroad management recog?
nized the imminence of the strike.
Embargo orders were issued or
posted all over the United States
stating that because of impending
strike conditions tickets would be
sold only subject to delay. Supplies
and strikebreakers were mobilized at
strategic points. The country wait?
ed breathless, for the storm to brake
It was apparent that neither party
was bluffing.
President's Motive.
Assiduous efforts are being made by
politicians nnd representatives of
special interests to discredit the mo?
tives of the President in his relation
to this controversy. The inside story
cf the strike legislation is here made
public for the first time.
The President saw a national calam?
ity impending. Immediate action was
imperative. He called certain lead?
ers of his party into conference with
him in the President's room at the
Capitol. They were: Senator Kern,
democratic floor leader of the senate;
Senator Newlands, Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Interstate Com?
merce; Representative Kitchen, Dem?
ocratic floor leader of the House;
Representative Adainson, Chairman
of the House Committee on Inter?
state Commerce.
The President and these four gen?
tlemen wrote the bill which was
presented to congress with the spe?
cial message of the President on the
following day. Neither the railroads
nor the brotherhood were consulted.
Neither party knew what the bill con?
tained until it was made public. Neith?
er party mnde any demand on
the President or his advisers, or had
the slightest influence in the framing
of the bill.
That portion of the bill providing
for the establishment of an eight
hour dny for railrond employees en?
gaged in the operation of trains be?
came a law. It was accepted by the
brotherhoods; the strike was can?
celled nnd the impending calamity
was averted.
What it Meant to the Farmer.
An appeal is being made to the
farmer on the eve of the Presidential
election to vote against Mr. Wilson
because his attitude on the strike
question. Has the farmer considered
what a strike would have meant to
him?
No class of the American people
stood the chance of losing so much
from a strike as the furmer. A sin?
gle week of inactivity in the operation
of freight and express service would
have paralyzed his market for a
month or more. Coming at the time
of marketing of perishable fall fruits
and vegitables his loss from this
source alone would have run into the
millions. The demoralization of his
market would have opened opportun?
ity for juggling in the grain ex?
changes and commission centers, an
opportunity which crafty speculators
would have speedily seized, and mul?
tiplied millions would have been
taken from the hnrd earned profits
of the producer.
When a single denl in the Chicago
wheat pit runs into profits of $2,000
per minute on a "bull' market, hu?
man reason is powerless to conjec?
ture what the gamblers would have
done to the farmer with a strike on
and the world clamoring for food.
The gambler in foodstuffs has the
game rigged against the farmer
"both ways from the middle." A na?
tion-wide strike would have been a
gamblers carnival.
This article may fall under the eye
of a melon grower in the Rocky Ford
district in Colorado. He can guess
what would have happened to him
in September had it been impossible
to ship his cantaloupes. Or it may,
perchance, reach a peach grower in
Michigan; even water freight across
Lake Michigan to Chicago would not
have saved him.
The apple grower of the Oznrks, the
Northwest or New York would have
been in the same deplorable state.
Storage facilitis are inadequate to
handle the entire normal crop, and it
would have been impossible to get the
fruit storage without train service.
The immense dairy interest, the
poultry mnrket, the citrus growers, the
growers of prunes, plums, pears, etc.,
would all have shnrcd in the National
calamity which impended.
All this Averted.
President Wilson prevented this
calamity. For this he is denounced
bv those who fail to state how they
would hove protected the interests of
the farmers of America in such a
crisis.
It is estimated by the railroad man?
agement that the alleged increase in
wages which they would have to pay
because of the eight hour day would
Cliin
amount to a figure ranging from $60,
000,000 to $100,000,000 during the
year. Allowin?? their highest figure
of $100,000,000. the farmers of the
United States would have lost more
than this in thirty duys had there
not been a a man in the White House
hiv enough to protect the interests of
the whole pople.
j Five cents a bushel on wheat is easy
I picking for the pit gamblers when
j they can play the market ut their own
j sweet will. It would have meant fifty
, million dollars lost to the farmers on
j the billion bushel crop. The gamblers
may get it anyhow, but they will not
lind it so eusy since the Federal De?
partment of Agriculture has estab?
lished an honest system of grading
under a law passed by the present
Congress.
James K. Armsby, one of the
largest shippers of fruit in California
and a Republican, recently made the
statement that if the threatened rail?
road strike had taken place it would
have bankrupted many of the fruit?
growers of the state. He said it
would have caused a loss of not less
than $20,000.000 to the fruit industry
of California alone. This amount >s
probably much too low.
The peach crop now going to
market, with a value of about
$55,000,000, would have been practi?
cal! a total loss had the President
no induced Congress to act.
The $200,000,000 apple crop would
have been shrunken b" inability to
get to storage and disorganization of
the market to the tune of at
least $100,000,000.
The potato crop, of a value of about
$220,000,000, would have involved a
further loss of at least $50,000,000.
The cabbage farmer of Northern
Ohio, the grower of tomatoes for the
cannery and the celery grower of
Michigan and Florida would havb
kept mournful compuny.
Melons from Colorado, California,
Arizona and Deleware, grapes from
'he vine-clad hills of Western New
York and the sunny slopes of Yakima
and Kenatchee. prunes; pickles, poul?
try, butter and eggs would have gone
down in the common cataclysm.
Only One Phase of It.
Some of this stuff might have been
fed to the hogs, to be sure, ullhough
a hog does not fatten on a fruit and
vegetable diet; but when hogs and
cattle are ready for the market they
must go. The farmer cannot feed be?
yond the finishing point without in?
creasing daily loss. What would a
strike have meant to the live stock
market of the farmer? And what
would it have meant to the consumer,
with the cold storage facilities in con?
trol of the packers combine ?
The direct and immediate loss which
the farmer would have sustained in
ease of n strike is but one phusc of
the danger which threatened his in?
terests. The depressing influence
upon market prices.resulting from the
inability of consumers to buy be?
cause of lack of employment would
have been felt in every single item of
this year's farm products. Take this
single instance: This telegram sent
to President Wilson on Sept. 2 by
Henry Ford, the world's greatest
automobile manufacturer:
The President: The moment it
is positively known that a strike
will become effective on the rail?
roads the Ford Motor Company
will of absolute necessity shut
down its factory and all of its
assembly plants throughout the
country, and every man of its
more than -10,000 workers will
have to go off the pay roll.
Our business is so organized
that the supplies and products
must be kept moving constantly.
We cannot move a day without
railroad service. We are making
2,200 cars every day. The mate?
rials must be moved in and cars
out. I sincerely hope something
can be done to avert the strike.
Your efforts are appreciated and
should be commended by every
citizen in the country.
HENRY FORD
This telegram is typical of what
would have happened to practically
every American industry had a strike
ensued. Millions of contented and
well employed laborers would have
faced enforced idleness; poverty and
destitution would have come to mil?
lions of workingmen's homes. The
workingmen's power to buy food
products depends upon his daily wage.
Stop his wage and his consuming
power is limited to the barest neces?
sities of life.
Greatest of All Panics.
A nation-wide rnilway strike would
have paralyzed every American in?
dustry and precipitated a panic such
as has never been witnessed in the
history of this country. The farmer
provides the necessities of life for
America's millions and multiplied
millions overseas. A strike would
have disorganized the farmer's iriar
ket, destroyed and wasted the prod?
uct of his toil, and would have
brought him face to face with an
economic condition from which he
could not have recovered for years.
Let the farmer get the record
straight. He faced this crisis which
threatened him with incalculable
financial loss. There was no law in
force to compel arbitration between
contending forces who refused to
yield to voluntary arbitration. The
President and Congress performed
their inevitable duty for the protec?
tion of the public. For this act
President Wilson is denounced by
those who offer no suggestive remedy
to meet such a situation had they
been in power.
On the whole, has not the farmer
good reason to thnnk God that Wood
,row Wilson was in the White House
with nerve and sanity enough to stop
a national calamity.
NEVER AGAIN.
A lumber man, who lives in an ad
Joining county, wus in this office re?
cently, nnd was asked as to the situa?
tion politically in his community. He
said that he had always voted the Re?
publican ticket, but this was one time
when he was going to break the rec?
ord, he was going to vote for Wil?
son and Trinkle. He said he passed
.through the Roosevelt panic, being in
business nt that time in Wise coun?
ty, and said that was the only time
in n business career of many years
that ho hnd money in the bank and
couldn't get it. He lias fully recov?
ered from the effects of that panic on
the lumber business and during the
Wilson prosnerity has recoped his
losses and is now har>ny and pros
Iicrous. The country is full of men
ust like this gentleman, but they are
not talking.
TAZEWELL, VIRC
DRUGGIST JOIN "TANLAC WEEK"
By Window Display und Spirited Cam?
paign for More Sales, They Endorse
New Remedy.
"Tnnlnc Week" is being celebrated
in all parts of the country by drug?
gists who have the agency for this
remarkable preparation in their res?
pective towns and here John E. Jack?
son has installed a window display
which is both attractive and interest?
ing.
Eor over 11 months this new remedy
has been advertised in the columns of
.his paper and the power of adver?
tising when properly done and placed
in a good newspaper is indicated by
,the tremendous sale this particular
remedy has enjoyed locally as well as
nationally.
It is interesting to note that Tan
lac is advertised only in newspapers,
yet its sales have increased until it
has the largest sale by millions of bot?
tles of an medicine nnd druggists
everywhere state they have had a
greater demand for this particular
remedy than for any other on their
shelves.
Dr. John E. Jackson takes a great
deal of pride in the fact that he has
been selected as the local distributor
.for Tanlac nnd the advertiser likewise
has expressed his pleasure at having
been successful in securing this popu?
lar nnd enterprising druggist to hnndlc
it.
The window display mentioned
above will be on display in Dr. Jack?
son's window several dnys.
SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO
TAZEWELL FARMERS.
(By R. R. Wall, County Agri?
cultural Agent.)
Since entering the county on Au?
gust I, 1916. as county demonstrator,
I have discussed with as many farm?
ers and business men as possible what
they thought to bo the most needed
improvement in the county along ag?
ricultural lines. Almost without ex?
ception they turn to the cattle. Not
a few. but n great many of the older
men of the county tell me that our
stock is not so good now us it was
years ago. I do not know about this
but I do know that it is not enough
to keep up to past standards. We
must go forward and mnke progress
and improvement or else the boat
will leave us. To stand still is to go
backward. Many say, "Look what
Russell, Lee and Washington Coun?
ties have done for their stock." It is
;*ood to sec what the others have done
but looking will do us little good, un?
less we profit by what we see and do
something ourselves.
Seeing that most all of our people
realize the need of it, and believing
that we can accomplish much great?
er results if we work together, I am
preparing to form a stock associa?
tion, similar to that formed by the
people of Russell, for the promotion
of our live stock interests.
Now, dont say it's no use; these
people wont work together, etc., but
go to work wourself. Yon will have
the honor of being one of the origina?
tors of this good move and the other
fellow will fall in line. Just for once
lets all get together.
It is all very well to say, "This is
a good move and I hope it will suc?
ceed, but what I want is your renl
support. Buy as much stock in the
association as possible and agree to
keep an association lull if you ran.
In the next issue of this paper, I shall
place before you a suggestive set of
by-laws and regulations for the as?
sociation. Examine them and when
1 call on you make any s.-hgestioas
which you think will be improvements
As soon as possible I shall arrange
for a meeting for the formation of
our association and then our buying
committee will buy first-class bulls
and place them in service at once.

>1N I A, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13,
TRINKLE WILL
WIN, SAYS WILLIS
Enthusiasm of the Democrats
For Their Candidate Means
Victory in the 9th District.
Hon. It. H. Willis, of Roanoke, who
hits been in the Southwest in the in?
terest of the election of Mr. Trinklc,
gave the Ronuoke Times the follow?
ing:
"The enthusiasm, and energy of
the Ninth District Democrats is
worth traveling there to see. Their
loyalty and devotion to Lee Trinkle
is beautiful und inspiring.
"I went there thinking that we
were merely helping to make as good
show as possible against Slemp, but
I came away convinced that we are
going to win. Trinkle has shown
himself to be a remarkable leader.
As he goes through the district the
sentiment for him follows like a
great tidal waive. Nothing can de?
scribe except n 'great popular
movement'. I asked a county
chairman how he accounted for it
and his explanation was that Trin?
kle is speaking like a man inspired
with a message for a people who
have been blinded for years by prej?
udice in favor of a party name.
Cumpaign of Education.
"Miners and small farmers who
for years have been voting the Re?
publican ticket are walking for miles
to hear every Democratic speaker,
and paying the closest attention to
ali that is said. This is really a
campaign of education. The every?
day citizen is coming to sue that the
Democratic party is his party, that
the old time rally boys, rally stuff
that has always brought out the Re?
publican vote of the Ninth has re?
sulted in the election of men who
are not friendly to the interests of
the public. I am firmly convinced
that nothing holds the Ninth District
Republican party together but the
inherited local prejudices and the
further facts that they have been
taught for years to believe that a
Democratic victory would mean a
financial panic. Now that, they
have had a demonstration of peace
and prosnerity under Democratic ad?
ministration and have seen that the
Democratic party is in favor of
those things which are for the bene?
fit of the general public and not a
few special interests, the thinking
men are turning ugainst their for- :
mer teachers.
"Many prominent Republicans are |
openly working for Trinkle, and '
Frank Caldwcll, his campaign man?
ager, is daily rccseving telegrams
from men who say that, they have
heretofore supported Mr. Slemp, but
now propose to support Trinkle and
Wilson. This has become so pro?
nounced a movement that the Slemp
workers are trying to persuade such
Republicans as these to split the
ticket and vote for Wilson nnd Slemp
if they will not vote the straight Re?
publican ticket.
"The boys out there in the trench?
es Tiend a message of thanks for the
assistance and encouragement that
the Democrats of Roanoke are send?
ing to them, nnd pnrtiourlarly to the
Young Men's Democratic Club. The
principals of the club are those on
which this campaign is being fought.
The slogan is, 'the present and the
future'.
Common Sense Arguments.
"Little of the old bitterness is be?
ing manifested, but the voters are
being appealed to by common sense
arguments and statements of what
the two parties stand for and have
A weak President would have
j plunged the United States into
war.
It is asy to hate, easy to strike.
I'o do so requires neither bravery
nor intelligence?and these are
I the very attributes which must
characterize our Chief Execu?
tive if he is to guide the nation
aright.
The courage, the devotion and
the statemanahip of Woodrow
Wilson have saved the nation
from a horror and a crime. He
played for the verdict of man?
kind and he has won the ver?
dict.
He has stood firm against the
lying clamor of concessionaries
basley willing to guarantee
their dividends with the blood of
American youth.
It is not alone that the Unit?
ed States is at peace, that the
land is not filled with a vast
crying, that homes arc not dark?
ened, that our eyes are not senr
red by the sight of the blind,
the nianirled and the wrecked.
International law has been
upheld, the rights .of neutral
nations secured, and dvilhUM'
tion itself saved from the world
ruin that would have followed
America's leap into madness.
It has been shown that creed
does not dominate us, that we
square our practices with our
' professions, and that weaker
people need not fear our friend
t ship.
Even while feeding the hun?
gry of the world, relieving
wretchedness, and championing
, humanity, we stand ready to
conduct those negotations by
which peace will come again to
the world.
Woodrow Wilson has given
you peace and prosperity with?
out sacrifice of principle, with?
out loss of honor.
Arc these blessings nothing
to you?
Do you want to serve notice
upon mankind that the United
States favors a policy of war
and conquest?
Do you stand for the propo?
sition that no President may ex?
pect re-election who offends High
Finance or who refuses to take
his foreign policies from con?
cessionaries and alien con'spi
I rators?
I -
j Wilson and Trinkle are
champions of the people's
' rights, and for honorable
I peace with all the world.

clone or failed to do. The princi?
ples of an active and forward looking
Democracy show up magnificently in
comparison with the Republican
campaign of criticism that promises
nothing, because it fears that what?
ever it promises will offend some of
the discordant elements in the Re?
publican party.
"I believe that the Ninth District
voters are coining to see that nothing
can be accomplished by a party com?
posed of such elements ns Roosevelt
on one one hand with his anti-tier
man views, and Hughes on the other
catering to the German vote; such
staudpatteers as Root and Smoot on
the other extreme standing for special
interests, and Hiram Johnson on the
other standing for nearly every
plunk in the Democratic platform.
Little wonder that they should see
the naked hypocracy of a party,
whose leaders are afraid to promise
anything for fear of offending half
the party whose only common bond
of symapthy is a desire for the of?
fices and the control of the United
Stales treasury."
POLITICAL PULLETS.
(Bv H. M. S.)
It will be great disappointment to
Brothers llarman ami Galloway to
wake up on the morning of Nov. 8.
and and read of Wilson having car?
ried New York, Mnssaehusettcs, West
Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and other
States with a total plurality of sev?
eral million voles. That ambassador?
ship to Siam and the postofficc at
Graham will dwindle into thin air.
An observant gentleman comment?
ing on one of Hughes' speeches said
that he found no grammatical errors,
and liked his apperauce. He looked,
he says, like a man who would like
to vole for Wilson. A Ninth district
Republican who had carefully read
the President's speech at Baltimore,
was heard to sny, "that would be the
man for my vole if 1 didn't belong
to the other party."
, "Set the woods on fire in Lee," says
a headline, but it don't tell us wheth?
er it was caused bv a locomotive, au?
tomobile or the "burning" eloquence
of u Slemp mouthpiece.
I belong to the Republican party,
said a life-long Slemp adherent. He
was right, lie belongs to it exactly
as Thompson's mule belonged to
Thompson.
Deep down in their bowels they
hate Wilson for doing things none
of their Presidents could ever have
done?the Federal Reserve, the Rural
Credit, the Tariff Commission and
the eight hour law.
Wonder if Slemp has explained his
vote for the eight hour law and inci?
dent ly remarked that seventy other
Republicans were candidates for re?
election and voted for it, too.
In a straw vote taken by the Lit?
erary Digest, of the labor union lead?
ers, Mr. Wilson gels 32I> to 48 for
Hughes. And it lias been heretofore
remarked that "straws show which
way the wind blows.
An observant Cincinnati Republi?
can writes that. Ohio looks favorable
to Wilson ami West Virginia cinched,
and Hughes too tame to interest a
tad pole. It looks like four more
years of Wilson.
It will be interesting to observe
whether Hughes will try lo ombarass
the administration pending the new
submarine discussion. It will prove
him either an American or u cad.
NEWS NOTES OF CAVITT'S
CR FEE.
I will furnish you some informtaion
regarding our church, Sunday school
and Healing Springs School.
We are very much encouraged with
our school, having an enrollment of
more than fifty pupils. We are well
pleased with our teacher, Miss Eva
Goodman and believe she will be suc?
cessful in her work, as all the pat?
rons are co-operating with her and
seem willing to help in anything she
suggests for the upbuilding of the
school. A box supper will be given
at the school building Saturday, Oc
tobre 14th at 7:80 p. m. Everybody
is invited to be present. Ladies and
girls will please bring boxes. The
amount collected will be used in the
improvment of the school building
and grounds.
The Sunday School of the Union
Cavitt'a Creek church has already
well begun a fortv weeks Scientific
Temperance Poster and Leaflet Edu?
cational Campaign. A large poster,
24x30 inches is exhibited each week
in front of the church. Miniature
leaflets of exact reproduction are dis?
tributed among the members of the
Sunday School and community.
Rally day will be observed the 4th
Sunday in this month. This observ?
ance was prevented in September by
sickness and death in the home of Ihe
leader of the Sunday School. We ex?
pect Brother Yost, who has been
faithfully filling his monthly appoint?
ments in this church, to again preach
for us at 11 o'clock, immediately af?
ter Sunday School session. Basket
dinner will then be served. Members
of the Sunday School will render ex?
ercises in the afternoon. Sunday,
October 15th, at 3 o'clock in the after?
noon, services will be held in this
union church in memory of Ethel
Hester, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
W. Sluss. Services will be conduct?
ed by the Rev. Homer Anderson, who
baptized her into the fold in her early
infancy. Though scracely twenty
months of age she was a member of
our Cradle Roll department. Our
little one understood when being ask?
ed the quesetibn. "Does Ethel want
to go to Sunday School?" She showed
her delight and eagerness to go.
Because of our inability to secure
the services of our pastor for the ap?
pointed honr for the interment, Mr.
A,- Z. Litz, an uncle of the deceased
child, kindly brought the Rev. Mr.
Campbell to our home, who conducted
a serious and impressive service.
Friends and relatives brought a
great many lovely flowers. Did the
Great Gardener send her here to show
us how fair the flowers of Paradise
can bloom, then came and in great
tenderness transplanted her in the
sweet filcds of Etlen, to grow and dc
I velop into more perfect beauty for the
Muster's use?

JACKSON NOT
ASKED TO COME
TO THE NINTH
Richmond Negro Politician Says
Report is Too Ridiculous Kor
Him Even to Deny.
The folowing report from Richmond
appearing in a recent issue of The
Ronnoku Times regarding n much
discussed question in the Ninth dis?
trict, settles the mutter mid proves
Hint it doosnt1 nay to circulate a cam?
paign yarn unless you are sure you
"can get away with it."
Richmond, Oct. 0,?"Neither in my
private capacity as a citizen nor as n
member of tlw National llannihul
Democratic League, um 1 taking the
slightest, part in Virginia politics,"
said Giles U. Jackson, prominent ne?
gro attorney, last night. "The report
that 1 was going to use my influence
in the .Ninth district against Con?
gressman Slemp is too absurd even
to deny. 1 have no interest or Influ?
ence there, nor have 1 ever received
from liny person in that district nn
invitation to come there and speak
If is a fabrication pure und simple,
without even the semblance of truth."
Ordinarily, neither of the major
parties in Virginia would have had
the temerity to suggest that, the oth?
er side wns seriously considering re
enforcing its campaign with speak?
ers of the colored race. Since the
adoption of the new constitution, it
has been accepted that the race is?
sue has been forever divorcod from
politics and will not again arise to
disturb the pleasant relations that, ex?
ist now between the white and color?
ed elements of the population.
Hut. the Republicans of (he Ninth
Virginia district, where Congressman
G. Uasconi Slemp iy lighting for re?
election have given currency to the
report, thill the Democrats of flint dis?
trict have extended a welcome to an
oflcr of support from Giles It. Jack?
son, of Richmond, and (he news has
been assiduously el minted by the
Ninth district Republican orgnnizu
t ion.
SHORT-TIME LOANS
Size of Loan and I'urpose for Which
Kmployped Have Direct Hearing
Upon Itate of Interest Charged.
Kvery farmer before burring money
should ask himself certain nuontlona,
according to ftullelill No. 409, Fac?
tors Affecting Interest RtttoB and
Other Charges on Short-Time Farm
Loans, recently published by the de?
partment. Very often the farmer who
does not. ask himself these gUOStioitS
may lind I hat (he banker will re?
quire answers before he makes the
loan.
"As the importance of promotion?
and encouraging improved system of
farming becomes increasingly ap?
parent," to quote the bulletin, "atten?
tion will he directed more and more
toward such questions as the pur?
pose ami size of farm Iouiih. How
are the proceeds of a proposed loan
to be employed? Are they to be ex?
pended for the productive purpose,
such IIS would lend to improvement
in the funning business? Is the size
of the loan well adapted to the pur?
pose in view? linen the period for
which the loan is (o run conform to
the lime (he capital is actually need?
ed? All of (hose questions have a
direct, bearing on the cohIh of short
lime farm loans?
I'urpose of the Loan.
"The use of any given loan ought
to yield a return sufficient at least
lo repay bolh interest, and principal.
If the returns are not sufficient for
this purpose, then the money should
not be borrowed The only wuy in
which the use of credit can be dir?
ected so as to serve the intercuts of
improving agriculture in to control the
extension of loans so that they may
be used for productive purposes only.
This means, at the same time, a safer
use of credit.
"In some localities banks offer
loans to farmers at reduced rates of
interest when tho money borrowed
is used for some specific and ap?
proved purpose, such as the purchase
of live stock, the building of silos, or
the making of other improvements
which will make farming more pro?
fitable under the given conditions.
Size of the Loan.
"The banker usually charges a
higher rale of interest on a small
loan than on a large one. The cler
icnl and bookkeeping expenses are
the same in both cases. Unless a
higher rate were charged on small
loans, the point would bo reached
where the expenses connected with
such loans would be greater than the
interest. On the other hand, it pays
banker to handle large loans nt a
lower rate of interest.
"The importance of restricting
loans to those for approved productive
purposes and of having the size of
<hc loan conform to the requirements
of sound farm investment has been
recognized by some bankers to such
an extent that they employ advisers
who discuss such questions with their
farmer patrons in order to promote
the interests of their fnrm-lonn busi?
ness. This plan has been followed
by banks in the Central West, in Now
England, and in the South. The plnn
of one of the southern banks may be
taken an nn example. The agri?
cultural adviser employed by this bank
if tor ? conference with the prospec?
tive borrower,' decides whether the
proposed loan is businesslike nn ex?
pedient. If the purpose of the loun
meets with his approval he works out
a plan of procedure with the farmer.
The farmer may consider that he
needs a loan of $1,000. As a result of
his conference with the adviser it
mny be found that $700 is sufficient.
They discuss the safety of the -iro
poscd investment, the additional
equipment necessary, and, in case' of
live stock is to be purchased, the crop
rotation that will furnish the most
economical supply of feed. Those
itemsareall arrangednndagreed upon
before the bank makes the loan. After
the loan has been made and the capi?
tal invested it is the duty of the ad?
viser to visit the farm from time to
time to see if the plan adopted is ad?
hered to and if the investment is
yielding proper results. Such a plan
means added protection to both the
'farmer and tho banker."
