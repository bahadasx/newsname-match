yesterday had given no assurance
that the utmost resources would

"If we allow Rumania to be

assure Mr. Dillon that the allies
were doing there utmost to sup

"We have not the least doubt." said
the minister, "that Germany Is con

own interest, but in a spirit of ven

challenge her power."
The British public has displayed
unabated interest in the doing of the

regarding their history. The subject

today issued a communication in
which after reciting the demands
set forth in the ultimatum of Vice
Admiral Dartigue du Forne, com
mander of the Anglo-Frensh fleet,
that the entire Greek fleet except
the armored cruiser Averoff and the
battleships Lemnos and Kilkis be
turned over to the entente allies, it
says:
"Besides these measures, (the de
livery of the fleet), the commander
of chief of the allied forces declares
it indispensable that the breach
locks of all batteries of Piraeus be
removed, which batteries he pro
poses in part to occupy.
"The admiral declares he will ex

Finally, to guarantee France's
orient armies, the admiral demands
to exercise, through officers he will
appoint, the control of the police
and the service of the Piraeus
Larissa railway."
The government's statement then
adds:
"The Hellenic government, before
the terms of a few hours were al
lowed to expire, declares that it
considers it its duty to protest

to which, however, it will submit

In the interview M. Venlzelos de

government in Saloniki and exercise
all powers of state, "levying taxes to
maintain the military service and raise
and equip troops."
M. Venizelos said that wnen in Sep

the necessity of fulfilling Greece's
treaty obligations with Serbia, King
Constantine replied:
"1 urn prepared to leave the internal
affairs of Greece to the government,

M Vtuizclos said he replied to the
king:
"You are enunciating the doctrine of
the divine rights of kings, with which
we have nothing to do in Greece. Y'our
father was freely elected by the Greek
peopie to be their king, and you are his
successor. Clearly there is no divine
right in that title. It is based upon
the mandate of the people."
"Clearly King Constantine has step
ped outside the limits of the Greek
constitution," M. Venizelos continued.
"What lies at the root of the king's
attitude is that he regards the kingdom
of Greece as his own personal proper

tonight as to what he would have done
when the Lusitania was sunk, declared
that he would have "made it known in
terms unequivocal and unmistakable
that we should not tolerate a contin
uance of friendly relations" when no
tice was published "with reference to
the threatened action."
Mr. Hughes was in the midst of his
discussion on the maintenance of
American rights when he was inter
rupted by the question.
"The path of peace is the path of
self respect which maintains the dig
nity of our citizenship and cements the
friendship of all nations," he said. A
man from ths aydience interrupted
him.
"Justice Hughes, just a moment.
Please permit a respectful interrup
tion," shouted the man. "What would
you have done ?" T e heckler got
no further for the moment. His voice
was drowned in cries, hoots and cat
calls. "Please permit the question to
be asked," requested Mr. Hughes. "I
do not want anyone shut off from a
courteous question. Go on, sir," the
nominee added, turning to the ques
tioner. "Please ask your question."
To cries of "Go on, you boob!" and
general hum of voices, the questioner
continued.
"I ask you with ail respect that I
know, what you would have done when
the Lusitania was sunk? See if you
can answer that."
Mr. Hughes paused for a moment.
"I will answer this," the nominee
said. There was considerable confus
ion in the hall and he continued: "Now,

from the administration in Washington
urging that the preparedness parade
be abandoned on the ground that it
would irritate our American citizens of
