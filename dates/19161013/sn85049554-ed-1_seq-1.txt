destroyer Paulding off Bar Harbor,
Maine, and activity of the destroyer
Sterrett in New York harbor. Between
these two outposts nine other destroy

In Narragansett bay seven other de

St. Louis, Oct. 13.—A resolution Was
'introduced In the house of deputies of
the Protestant Episcopal general con

to sit as delegates. This resolution,
which would alter a policy that has
prevailed since the organization of the
church In America, was introduced by
R. H. Gardiner, of Gardiner, Maine.
George Gordon King, treasurer of the
board of missions, reported that during
the last three years the board of mis

payments have been met and that the
reserve on hand was $748,776.
More than half the mission receipts

Divorce Question Debated.
For three hours yesterday afternoon
the question of marriage and divorce

general convention In session here In
the Moolah temple.
At the finish a motion to put to an
Immediate vote the adoption of the
canon forbidding a minister of the Pro

In marriage any person who has a hus
band or wife living, even the innocent
person in a divorce obtained on the
ground of adultery, was carried by a
majorityof five, 245 voting in favor to
540 voting against taking the vote.
Final oVti' Goes Over.
Later an attempt to force adjourn

parliamentary tangles a deputy who
had voted with the majority on previ

the plea that a house so evenly divided
on so important a question ought to

at 11 o'cldck.
Call Conditions Damnable.
In the "debate the conditions in the
United States concerning marriage and
divorce were called "scandalous, in
iquitous, damnable, and ruinous."
It was charged that persons of wealth
who were guilty of sinful marriages
sought the sancition of marriage In the
Protestant Episcopal church because of
its social prestige, anwd hence there
was a duty on the part of the church to
lead In reform.
On the other hand. It was insisted
that the present standard of the church,
which forbids marriage only to the
guilty party in divorce for adultery, wtCS
high enough and all that was necessary
Is to bring the people up to this stand
