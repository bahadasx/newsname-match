German U Coat Sinks Ships
Ocean Traffic Closed
.New Move
Saturday there appeared at
New York a German under sea
craft called the U.23 Boat, Capt
Rose. Just where it came from
and what its mission was not
fully stated tho its captain paid
his respects to officers of our
navy, : He tarried but a short
time and went under and was
not heard from again until ships
begato signal by wireless that
a submarine was sinking every
thing it could come tip vith, off
Naragansett and outside of the
three mile limit. British mer
chant vessels and a few neutrals
were "treated to the surprise of
their careers, and before activi
ties on the part of the submarine
bad ceased, there were nine ships
on their way to the bottom of
the ocean with their cargoes.
The U. 53 gave warning to
ships and so far as reported there
were no lives lost, au passen
gers and crews being given time
to get off their ships and away.
Two American vessels, were
halted but so soon as the U. 53
made them out they were not
assaulted.
- The distress signals tiroi to the
the doomed ships all sorts of
craft and all were landed at
Newport or soma near harbor.
No word has been received
from the U. 53 since her most
daring exploit It is held by
some commanders of ships that
there were more than one of the
submarines operating, but if
there were more than the -U. 63
number of merchant ships sunk
and not from any more being
seen.
It is held by the administra
tian that the exploit of the U. 53
of the German navy in sinking
nine merchant ships on our eas
tern coast Sunday evening was
not Jn violation of International
Law. Col. Roosevelt is having
all sorts of fits. Judge Hughes
and Prof. Taf t are between the
devil and deep sea literally.
Electrical Supplies
. The Nickell Electrical, supply
house which was located at Mar
celine has moved - here and will
soon be straightened out and
have the town wired ready for
the line on its way from Bruns

ready to figure with all who wish
electric light or power. Mr. Fox,
chief electrician, began work
Wednesday on the' Bank of Key-
tesville, tfci first in town to have
fixtures put in and who will be
the first to welcome the juice
from Brunswick. , ,
Yellow Creek Ditch Allowed ,
' - Judge Lamb heard the evi
dence and the arguments in the
matter of the drainge ditch
which it is proposed to construct
to straighten out Yellow Creek,
at n adjourned term Wednes

The promoters of the agricul
tural enterprise wnich our sister
city on the eaat'held this year
can congratulate themselves on
a great success. No finer wea
ther could have been desired for
such an occasion and if the at
tendance had been larger ori the
last two 'days, more territory
would have been required to
hold the crowd.
The best exhibits and by far
the largest was in the needle
work debartment The speci
mens competing for premiums at
this show would have done great
credit to the state fair. The
butter,' cSkes and bread were as
fine as could, be found at any
show. It is said by N. B. Web
ster that the poultry show was
the largest he has ever seen at
a country fair, and he is on hand
when "birds" areon exhibition.
The stock ring in many in
stances did not come'up to the
general exhibits, some of the
individuals appearing as tho they
had just been caught up from
the pasture, but there fwas some
excellent animals shown. We
regret that we simply have not
the space to go into a descrip
tion of the various departments
as well as give the names of all
prize winners. From thisneigh-
borhoop we-learn that N. B.
Webster captured prizes on his
hogs and chickens, Dr. J. T.
Dewey second on white corn and
Roy W. Rucker second on yellow
core and Trammel' Nix second

The Roanoke band furnished
splendid music for the, fair and
the merchants of the city are
more than plaesed with the re
turns from the venture, especial

venders. The very warm, dry
weather was the only draw back
during the fair'
