FIELDS SPOKE AT
LOUISA YESTERDAY
LARGE CROWD HEARS OUR POP
ULAR CONGRESSMAN ON '
CAMPAIGN ISSUE8.
One of the enjoyable features of the
big day In Louisa, and one of the at
tractions that helped to bring In a big
crowd, was the speech delivered by
Congressman W, J. Fields, at the court
house.
A very large and attentive crowd
heard Mr, Fields and his speech was
certainly well worth listening to. His
Intimate personal knowledge of tbe
great things done at Washington dur
ing the post three and a half years en
ables him to give his hearers much new
and valuable Information about the
great administration of Woodrow Wil
son, and he' does It In a most impres
sive manner, His speech was a credit
to any public speaker.
We say deliberately and without any
desire to boost Mr, Fields, and believ
ing it to be strictly true, that his speech
wan one of the best, the must pointed,
the most instructive that has been de
livered In Louisa by any public speak
er for either party. He was heartily
applauded. His exposition of' the new
banking and currency law, and the
farm loan law, was remarkably clear
and It Is regretuble that every citizen
can not hear It.
