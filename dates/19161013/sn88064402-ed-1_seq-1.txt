FRESH WATER SHOULO BE
SUPPLIED FOR LIVESTOCK
Parish Demonstration Agent HI. C.
l"ondren discloses a serious condition
of affairs of vital interest to the cat
tle idlustry of the parish. In a let
tec adr:!ssed to the editou of this
lapec he says:
Word has hegua to reach th9 orfice
that c '.id!?rable stock ate dying over
the plarish. Some is generally at
tributed to charbon, but after making
personal investigation of several cases
I am convinced that stagnant water is
wholly responsible for the trouble.
In three pastures visited (luring the
week the cattle were found standing
in coulees that had dlriedl up till there
was no more than six inches of water,
and in two instance this water was
teeming with dead minnows and the
water so foul and putrid that it gave
off a real offensive odor. Yet the
cattle had to drink this water, because
there was none other to be had. Un
less we get a good rain within a week
or the owners of stock provide whole
some water the parish will see a loss
of $25,000 worth of livestock within
the next 30 days. The matter is
acute and should have the attention
of stock owners at once.

ANNUAL FISH FRY I
PA PLEASANT AFFAIR
The invitation of the Welsh Canal
company to their picnic and fish fry ai
last Saturday was pretty generally ac- P1
cepted and was greatly enjoyed by T
those who were able to attend. This
affair which is somewhat of a prosper- tE
ity feast, was inaugurated by the of- fE
ficials of the canal company and is it
becoming an annual affair looked for- tl
Iward to throughout the season. It
follows immediately the letting of the t,
water out of the main canal at the be
close of the irrigation spa;on, there
foie we all rejoice with them when the P
pumping season is over and a bumper L
e( op is assured. Itt
Iir'gc n'mher of' fli finiy 16rile ;r:i
.oio-d up through the big p umps at "
lie jildnt during the piumpinir scason a
and remuain in the dteup, rapid waters Ii
of the main canal until the end of the g
season when the water is drawn off ;v
and they are easily caught in the fish- h;
c. man's net. After the fish wcre P
caught and drcesed they wcre fiied
over numerous little camp fire I
throughout the wood-, great stacks IT
being piled up for the noonday feast. ir
Of course, humorous little incidents g
found their way into the process as s'
they always do in such affairs, among I IT
which was the attempt of one of the L
young ladies (a school teacher, we tt
understand) to remove the scales from l'I
a large catfish. rE
A table full of bread, sandwiches,
salads, pickles, cakes, etc., with the b'
lish and hot coffee furnished a sump- ti
tuous repast, and after the invocation
by Rev. J. W. Hervey, gormandizing e,
was indulged by the one hundred and 's
thirty guests. V;
Among the out of town guests were
Mr. D. M. Clark of Crowley, Prof. and P
Mrs. W. McHaney and Mr. and Mrs. s1
N. H. Poythress of Roanoke, Mr. and s
Mrs. Ben J. Freeman and Mr. and
Mrs. I. R. Price of Jenaings. T
The officials of the Welsh Canal b
company and their good wives, as si
host and hostess, were overwhelmed e
with thanks for the enjoyable enter- k
tainment and everybody hopes they
will see fit to perpetuate the affair. c
