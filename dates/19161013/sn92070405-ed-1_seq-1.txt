Lordsburg, New Mexico, Friday, Oclobcriath, 1916
BUBSCnirTION, 11 TER YEAR
IN JUSTICE TO
GOVERNOR McDONALD
Tho editor of the Weitorn Liberal
is In receipt of tho following com
munication from Governor William
C. McDonald which in Itself is ex
planatory: Dear Bush:
I ndtfco ,in the Western Liberal of
September 20th a short editorial
''which is really not in. accordance
with the facts. I do not know
whether you saw the Now Mexican
or whether you have been misled by
misstatements of the stato commit
tee. If you saw tho New Mexican
yourself you should have seen that
your statement p not at all correct.
The New Mexican published the
letter from the Secretary of the
Cattle Sanitary Hoard, saying that
I had never been president of that
board. What called out this state
ment was the fact that Mr. Hursum
in his speech of acceptance said that
for a Rood many years I had buen
head of tho board, whicli statement
was not true.
Now I have always had the impres
sion that it was your desire to run
a clean paper and 1 do not want to
believe that you would misstate any
thing of this sort wilfully. In tho
last sentence of tho editorial you say:
"If he wants to conceal it there must
be something to conceal." Such little
flings ns that will never make you a
paper that will be worth while or
respected by the people anywhere in
the stato of Now Mexico in my opin
ion. I am writing you because I have
had a good, opinion of you and yet
believe this statement mado in the
editorial was inadvertent and not
upon protense of personal knowledge.
Yours truly,
(Signed) W. C. McDonald.

TOE-MAINE POISON
AT HOT SPRINGS
Walter Chesser, formerly of Lords
burg, N. M., and recently from the
South Sea Islands, has boon spending
a few days at tho Indian Hot springs
giving swimming lessons. Walter is
the owner of a fine medal awarded
him the timo ho swam from tho Mare
Island to Melbourne, Australia ac
companied with .only one U boat, of
the German type. Ho says that when
he got about half way on bis trip he
was signaled from the top mast by
Admiral Von Slicenborg that the
ocenn was infested with man eating
sharks, and at that timo thought he
was going to have to get on his horse
and rido off, but ho made it without
a bobble.
While giving the swimming lessons
he claims that he had so many pupil.,
that ho had to engage an assistant
No one being present of any swimiug
renown outside of Mr. Alexander of
Indian Hot Springs, he engaged him
which resulted in some very grave
consequences ns ho had never had any
expedience either in that line nor had
never worked on an ostrich .farm:
So in approaching one of tho .students
who was making a frantic cft'ort to
swim, Mr. Alexander was very pain
fully kicked in tho probosis, indicting
a very lengthy nut not dangerous
wound with the toe nail. It was for
tunate that a party was present to
make a thorough diagnosis of the
case and found that "toe-mainc"
poison had sot in. One of tho guests
from tho White Mountains being on
the seconc of action witli a can of
Alaska sheep dip, made a v lUtiou oí
same and forcefully gave l""i.i a bath
and sloppod tho diseatiu from spread
ing, for which all the guest. are wty
thankful.
Mr. Chooser says that he can hearti
ly recommend the springs for being
the only placo to regain your nppe
tite; and it's also very good for m-
soinnin, corns, ingrowing toe nail.i or
baldness. He says the curative
powers are so great that 1m actually
believes that it would take the knoti
out of rough lumber.
