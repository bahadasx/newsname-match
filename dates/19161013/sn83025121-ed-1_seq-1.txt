INDIANAPOLIS. October.' 1
"Talking through one 'a bat 'Ought by
this time to be a dead industry' said
J President Wilson in the course. of hi
address yesterday at noon to a Conven
tion of good roads advocates and farav
ers. The convention was a non partisan
one and the President announced' that
his sddress was to be also non-partisan.
Partisan speeches, he said, were too
frequently without' substsotial reason
back of the words, the speakers talking
"through their hata.Y m,' , .
l ublte speakers should Ve compelled
to know what they are talking about
and be able to give proof of the sub
stance of their praise of criticisms, he
said. "In other words," declared the
President, " public speakers either
might to put up or shut up."
For Nationalisation
His luncheon address, in the opening
portions, dealt vltli the " nutionttli
tion of America." The speakers said
tVit he was for the nationalisation,
mobilization and cooperation of. the
natural resources of the nation for the
benefit and the protection of the na
tion.
He reiterated his sentiments la favor
of the United States becoming pne pf
a league of nations for the preserva
tion of the world's peace. f .
Denounced Sectionalism
He denounced the attempt being
made by the Republicans to divide the
nation again on the old lines of North
against the South, which the Republi
can national committee is doing in its
charges that congress is dominated by
the South end that the North ia being
discriminated against. ,!..
Mr. Wilson asserted that aa man
who brings up such an issue la fit ia
have thweonfldence of America. --
"He shows himself provincial",-be
said. "That is the depth of anti
patriotism." He did not mention
Hughes, saying that he had not wanted
to discuss politics but eould not help
referring to auch a question. "Our
chief object should be to draw America
together, to nationalise it," be said.

Shorn Hero Of Final Oama t
To Eraeat G. Shore, the gleet hurler
from East Bend, North Caralina, goes
the credit for winning jresterdsy's
game, thereby giving Boston lour vie-
tories out of five contests. Ha had the
Brooklyn batten completely" at his
mercy, and not once during .the entire
engagement did tne mea wbo eon
fronted him at the plate give trouble.
Shore allowed the Dodgers just three
scant singles and those, ..warn widely
scattered. Nobody had a. chance

and to the right and left, completely

cause they could aot hit the invincible

The only Brooklyn battera who were
able to find the ball for aafa hits were
