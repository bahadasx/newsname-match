I need not tell ou that I did not come
here to talk politics, but there is one
thing that is pertinent in this ronnec-i.or-.
which I cannot deny mvself the
privilege of saving.
Anv man who revives the issue of
sectionalism in this country is un
worthy of the confidence of the nation.
He shows h'mself a provincial, he
hows that he himself does not know
the various sections of his own coun
trv: he shows that he has shut his
i nwn hpxir nn in a little orov ince and
I tnat those who do not seek the special
interests of that province are to him
sectional while he alone is national.
That is the depth of anti-patriotic feel
ing." The setond speech was devoted to a
discussion of the works of the Demo
cratic administration for the farmers
of the nation.
, The president left here at 5:45 oclock
Thursday afternoon for Ing Branch,
X. X. where he arrived this afternoon.
TL. S. Must Mobilize Forces.
The president devoted most of his
first address to a discussion on the
nationalization of America. He
lared for the nationalization, mobili
zation and cooperation of the country's
resources. He said that after the
European war it will be necessary for
the United States to join all its forces
together. He repeated his former
declarations in favor of a league of
nations to maintain peace.
Has Xo Quarrel W ith rtepulillcans.
Bordering on the political, the presi
dent declared that "talking through
the hat ought to be a dead industry."
and that everv man who speaks in pub
lic should have the motto "put up or
shut up." He added that he was will
ing to take "my own medicine" and
that "if I don't put up I am ready to
shut up." In his brief luncheon speech
the president said, smiling, that the
Republicans were Just as good Ameri
cans as he was and that he would not
"read them out of school" unless they
were bad Americans.
"For after alL" he added, "we have
a common object. The quarrel for the
next three or four weeks is how to
realize what we all wish to accom
plish." HUGHES ASSERTS POSITION
IN LUSITANIA AFFAIR
Louieville, Ky, Oct. 13. Charles E.
Hughes, in replv to a question ad
dressed to nim here Thursday night in
the course of a speech, told how he
would hare acted, had he been presi

when warning was issued that the ship
was to be sunk, he would have "made
it known in terms unequivocal and
unmistakable that he would not tol
erate a continuance of friendly rela
tions" if the ship was sunk. "The
l.iiMitania. would not have been sunk."
he added He said he would have
had the state department so equipped
as to command
the respect of the j
world.
In a number of speeches delivered
Thursday at isolated towns in this
state, Mr. Hughes declared for the doc
trine of self respect, asserted he was
opposed to war. despite the Democratio
campaign speakers, and advocated a
policy of tariff protection. Near

Seat "Women as Delegates in
Convention; Discuss Al
tering Marriage Canon.
St- Louis. Mo. Oct 13 A resolution
was adopted in the house of deputies
of the Protestant Episcopal general
convention today giving women the
right to sit as delegates. This resolu
tion alters a policy that has prevailed
since the organization of the church
in America.
George Gordon King, treasurer of the
board of missions, reported that during
the last three years, the board of mis
sions had received Jt.900.6r. I and that
the reserve on hand was $748,775.
The Virginia delegation asked that
the Sunday nearest . Feb. 22 of each

UhrUM Heniarrlagr.
Remarriage of divorced persons, one
of the paramount issues before the
convention, provoked a spirited three
hour debate on Thursday.
Efforts to bring to a vote a proposal
to amend the canons of the church to
provide that no divorced person, having
a partner still living, shall have a wed
ding ceremony performed by a clergy
man of the church, fuither discussion
of the issue was postponed until next
Saturday. The house of bishops, the
upper house, announced It would con
sider the' proposal when the report of
the action of the lower house is pre
sented to them.
V Marriage After Divorce.
scoie of clergymen and laymen, i
aiguing from scriptural and legal!
angles, participated in the debate in j
the house of deputies, which began
w ith the submission by Rev Charles
F. J. Wrigley. of Brooklyn, of the re
port of the joint committee on legis
lation relating to hol matrimony. This
r port recommended that the present
canon of church, which permits a
clergyman of the church to perform
the marriage tetemony in the case
of innocent party to a divorce granted
on statutory ground, provided the case
has the approval of the diocesan
bishop be changed to read:
"No marriage shall be solemnized in
this church between parties, either of
whom has a husband or wife still liv
ing who as been divorced for any
cause arising after m: rriage."
