Several Ships Report Sighting
Alien Submarine.
Newport, R. 1., Oct. 13. The radio
station here today received a report
from a steamer stating that she had
sichted the German submprine. U-53,
m 11 off Nantucket Shoals at 7 o'clock
this morning. Official cognizance was
made of the mfssaee.
Autnorities do riot believe that the
T-53 carried sufficien tsupplies to last
her for three months as her captain
claimed. While officials would not
r.iy positively that the process of sup
plying submarines from ships along
the coast is now proceeding, one au
thority gave unmistakable evidence
that he thinks such reports come from
what the navy regards as reliable
sources and that they are worthy of
the strictest investigation.
To Patrol V. S. Coast.
Boston. Oct. 1 3. It was stated here
today that an American destroyer pa
trol in connection with recent subma
rine activities had been ordered effect
ive from New York to Galveston,
Texas. This statement lacks official
confirmation, however.
Sights Foreign Fleet.
Boston, Oct. 13. A fleet of foreign
cruisers and destroyers is off the
American coast, according to Captain
I.inderonS of the Russian steamship
Hesperus, which arrived here today
lrom Huelva, Spain. To the pilot who
boarded the vessel Captain Iinderoos
reported that "a lot of cruisers and
destroyers" passed his vessel off Cape
Sable. Wednesday, heading southwest.
At this rate of speed, he said, they
must be off the coast bv now.
The Hesperus's captain had not
heard of the German submarine's raid
Sunday as there is no wireless equip
ment on his ship. His report was
coupled today with that of pilots who
were in Massachusetts Bay yesterday
that three torpedo boat destroyers
cruised off this coast all day. One
Pilot said he thought they were Brit
ish vessels. Another sa!d they were
American. Ashore it was believed they
were American destroyers on patrol
duty.
To Convoy British Ships.
Belief that they were British de
stroyprs was held by many water front
authorities. The destroyers they con
tended came here to convoy British
ships. Three British seamers went out
last nitrht and today the Lord Cromer
and the Marengo prepared to sail.
The Kansan of the American-Ha
waiian line, under charter to the
France and Canada Steamship com
pany, and ladened with war muni
tions and horses for the allies, was ex
pected rtlso to said today for St,
Nazaire, France and Genoa.
Search for Submarine Base.
Neport, R. I., Oct. 13. Rushing
thru the waters of the Atlantic coast
as far north as the Canadian boundary
line, fifteen United States torpedo de
stroyers from the navy base here to
day are searching the bays and har
bors for a possible naval base of a
belligerent government.
One by one the destroyers left New
port harbor yesterday until at mid
nicht they were strug out along the
coast with three reported as far north
as Bar Harbor, Maine. Reports from
the destroyers by radio were riot di
vulged oy the station here, but so far
as is known no actual evidence of a
belligerent base of supplies has been
located.
Orders Survey of Coast.
Washington. Oct. 13. Admiral
Mayo, commanding the Atlantic fleet,
notified the nevy department today
that he had ordered a survey of the
New Kngland coast to investigate re
ports that belligerent ships had estab
lished a base there, or that wireless
plants were being operated in viola
tion of American neutrality.
Numerous reports of the same char
acter have been received by tl.. de
partment since the ebginning of the
war. Investigation was made in each
instance but was unproductive.
oBston. Oct. 13. A submarine of
unidentified nationality was reported
about 200 miles east of New York by
the steamer Bovic in a wireless mes

Topekan Again Heads League
of Kansas Municipalities.
Vote to Ask Amendment to
- State Constitution.
Independence, Kan., Oct. 13. The
Kansas league of municipal cities, the
members of which are in annual ses
sion here today thru its legislative
committee agreed upon a lengthy pro
gram of legislation to be asked at the
next session of the state legislature
and urged the submission of constitu
tional amendments embracing home
rule and the initative and referendum.
Officers were elected and Wichita
chosen as the 1917 meeting place.
The league will be headed for the
next year by W. L. Porter, of Topeka,
as president; Richard J. Hopkins, of
Garden City, as vice president, and
Homer Talbot, of Lawrence, as secretary-treasurer.
In addition to the constitutional
amendment the legislative program
seeks laws to exempt from the pres
ent limitation of debt-making pow
er of cities all bonds for revenue pro
ducing utilities, permitting cities own
ing water and lightp lants to buy or
construct ice plants, providing for re
vision of the present legislation con

DO WE GET MORE GAS?
Kansas Natural Files Schedule of
Rates for Boilers,
After bringing a mandamus action
in the state supreme court to force
the Kansas Natural Gas company to
file a schedule of rates for boiler and
industrial gas sold in the state, the
public utilities commission found to
day it didn't have a leg to stand on..
In fact, when by mutual agreement
of the gas company officiate and util
ities commission, the schedule was
filed with the commission today it was
discovered that the rates charged by
the Kansas Natural for boiler and in
dustrial gas are exactly the same as
those established bv the rnntmicuinn
December 10, when it established the
alleged confiscatory 28-cent gas rate.
The commission urged in rr-andamus
proceedings that the supreme court
compel the Kansas Natural to file a
schedule of rates for boiler and in
dustrial gas. The gas company didn't
appear to give a great many impolite
words whether it filed a schedule or
not.
"We didn't intend to furnish indus
trial and boiler gas, anvwav, as long
as it interfered with supplying the
consumers," said Robert Stone, attor
ney for the company, todav. "Nor do
we intend to furnish it no,v that the
rate is filed. The consumer will re
ceive the first consideration."
But the commission insisted and
hurried to the supreme court for help.
By filing the schedule the gas com
pany is cutting short some of tho
yards of red tape and litigation sur
rounding the gas case.

CAR SHORTAGE
DAMAGING TO
KANSAS MILLS
Relief Must Come or Shutdown
Will Be Result.
Output Will Be Decreased Un
der Present Conditions.
TOPEKA MILLERS ARE WORRIED
Storehouses Congested With
Flour In This City.
Situation Worse Than Yester
day, Say Railway Men.
Unless afforded relief from the car
shortage situation, several millers in
southern and western Kansas assert
they will be forced to shut down or
materially decrease the output of their
mills shortly. Millers in Topeka say
the car shortage is hitting them hard.
While they believe there is little dan
ger of any of the local plants suspend
ing or decreasing their output, pro
viding relief is obtained in a reason
able time, practically all mill and ele
vator men here say their storehouses
are congested. They are obtaining
enough cars to operate but that is
about all, officials of the plants assert.
Freight officials today reported the
car situation slightly worse than on
Thursday.
"We are short a few more domestic
cars than yesterday," Is the way one
official reported the situation. Despite
the increase today after railroad men
admitted Thursday that the crisis had
apparently been reached, freight offi
cials today were inclined to take an
optimistic view of the outcome. They
believe they will be able to afford
shippers some relief by the first of
next week. Some of the Topeka mills
reported today they had received that
promise from the roads. Today, how
ever, it is admitted by practically all
concerned, that the shortage Is as seri
ous as it has ever been in Kansas.
Shortage Is General.
Railroad men said today the short
age is not caused by congestion in any
one part of the country, altho thou
sands of loaded cars are being held in
the more important marts and ship
ping centers. In the east, where thou
sands of western cars are being held,
the shortage is reported as serious as
it is. here. The situation is general ell
over the country. The condition of
things today caused railroad men to
put new impetus into urging shippers
to unload and return cars quickly,
thereby co-operating with the roads
in easing up the shortage.
None of the Kansas roads has yet
declared any kind of an embargo. All
deny contemplating any such move.
The majority of the Topeka millers
today were inclined to give the rail
roads credit for doing all In the lat
ter's power to relieve conditions.
What the Millers Say.
David Page, manager of the Mid
Continent mills, today reported that
the warehouses of his plant are full.
"However," he said, "I believe the
railroads are doing as much as they
can to give us relief. We could use
thirty more cars today than we are
able to obtain."
S. B. Kramer, manager of the To
peka Milling company, also reported
congested warehouses He said he
looked for relief the first part of next
week. , ,,4
J. C. Fulton of the Inter-Ocean
Mills reported his plant found the
car situation tighter today "altho it
has not been easy sailing at any time."
Occiciils of the Kaw Milling com
pany reported difficulties in getting
as many cars as they need.

Atchison, Kan., Oct. 13.- Charles
Galbreath, the Topeka man who was
shot and badly wounded in a hotel
here Monday night by Charles Ross,

considered certain that he will not
recover. Galbreath, knowing that he
is in a dying condition, dictated a
statement to County Attorney Conlon,
giving his view of the affair.
Galbreath's statement is to the ef
fect that Ross went to the hotel and
flourished a gun. Galbreath got up
and pushed him out the door and ad
monished him to "have a little sense."
As soon as Ross was released he fired
the shot, Galbreath stated. Ross is

PROF. WROTE IT
BUT THE NAME
HE'S FORGOTTEN
Chicago, Oct. 13. A new "absent
minded -professor" joke caused smiles
at the University of Chicago today.
Professor Percy H. Boynton had en
thusiastically addressed a class in
English. Then he mentioned text
books. A girl asked him the title of
one of them.

of it," answered the professor. "Ask
for Boynton's book"
The class filed out, snickering.
ONE THOUSAND
ALREADY SIGN UP
FOR CONVENTION
Immense Advance Enrollment
of State Teachers.
Seyen Thousand Will Attend
Meeting, Says Pinet.
400 FROM KANSAS CITY ALONE
Southeastern Kansas, Too, Is
Coming in Heayily.
Great Interest From Small
Towns and Rurals.
With the date of the Kansas State
Teachers' association meeting a month
away, F. L. Pinet, secretary of the as
sociation, reported today that nearly
a thousand advance enrollments had
already been sent in. He predicts that
an enrollment of more than 7,000 will
be made this year and that many of
this number will be from sections of
the state not represented to any great
extent in past years.
Four hundred enrollments have
been received from Kansas City alone.
A heavy enrollment is coming - from
southeastern Kansas, such cities as
Independence, Chanute, Parsons,
Pittsburg and Fort Scott enrolling 100
per cent of their teachers. Other cities
that are reported to be planning to
attend in full are: Kansas City, Law
rence, Topeka. Ottawa, Salina, Beloit,
Wichita, Emporia and Hutchinson.
But the interest in the big meeting
is coming from the small towns, vil
lages and rural schools. In one day
the following counties sent in calls for
programs in quantities as follow: Re
public, 160; Reno, 100; Crawford, 200;
Rice, 130; Russell, 130; Ellsworth, 76;
Osage, 300; Brown, 60; Elk, 50.
FORThI FARMERS
Wilson Outlines What His Ad
ministration Has Bone.
Demands G. O. P. Opponents
"Put Up or Shut Up." ;
On Board President Wilson's Train,
Altoona, Pa., Oct. 13. Feeling
pleased over the reception given him
in Indiana yesterday, president Wil
son today is swinging along in his
private train en route back to Long
Branch, N. J. The Democratic leaders
still feel Indiana is an uncertain quan
tity but that in the two addresses the
president made yesterday he earned
home two points:
1. That the president is contempt
uous of such issues as sectionalism
and other contentions raised by his
Republican opponent and is deter
mined to carry on his campaign to
make his adversaries, as he says, "put
up or shut up, on what he regards
the real issues.
2. For the first time he has ex
plained exhaustively to the farmers
of the country what the Democratic
congress has done for them by pass
ing the rural credits bill, federal re
serve and other acts.
Foreign Policy, Real Issne.
On the latter point his lieutenants
feel he now has this idea well before
tho country. They feel the one big
issue upon which ths campaign rests
is whether or not the people endorse
the president's foreign policy. They
point to the enthusiasm accorded his
every utterance on peace yesterday as
string evidence of approval.
The president himself hinted in one
of his addresses that the "friendly
look of people who lined the streets"
encouraged him in the belief that they
believed in his expression of the na
tional spirit. Hence they feel Indiana
will come into line on the issue "peace
with Wilson."
Tomorrow the president will "talk
turkey" to a big delegation of Penn
sylvania Democrats who are going to
Shadow Lawn to hear him in the third
of his non-partisan speeches from the
veranda of his home.

gers endangered when train No. 6 of
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
railroad Jumped the tracks and car

WHOSE WIFE WASSHE?
"Going to Shoot Her Husband," Men
All Rush to Phone.
Dallas. Tex., Oct. 13. A wild-eyed
porter rushed into the second floor
room of the Union terminal and shouts
ed that "There's a woman downstairs
that's" goin' to shoot her husban' on
sight."
There are an even dozen telephone
booths on the second floor. Three
and seven-eighths seconds after the

Decree Death if Officers Invade
Riot Zone Again.
"Fighting Dan" Cady Replies
There'll Be a Cleanup Soon.
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 13. Tho fear
ing Friday the 13th might prove to be
bloody Friday, police and citizens tried
today to quell the oil men's strike
without calling militia.
The growing list of casualties, in
cluding another death reported today
in fearful riots, however, made it un
certain that this could be accom
plished. The strikers were in an ugly
mood today; while police and special
deputies under "Fighting Dan" Cady,
six-foot police inspector .were ready
for anything.
The police claimed to have better
control than heretofore, in view of
their Invasion of the strikers territory
and their closing of saloons. But, de
spite dead-lines and gunplay, the ter
ritory actually controlled by strikers
was a block broader today than pre
viously. Strikers heavily armed pa
trolled this territory, prepared for fur
ther fighting. Riots of the afternoon
yesterday, when a bystander was
killed and many injured, were not re
peated late at night, but the city was
nervous about the future.
Urged Strikers to Return to Jobs.
Early today the body of an uniden
tified man, apparently a Slav, the
third person killed, was found at 84
West Nineteenth street with a bullet
wound over the right eye. Investiga
tion revealed that the man was a
worker of the General Chemical com
pany who had tried to get strikers to
return to their labors for a bonus. A
saloonkeeper reported the man had
been in for a drink about midnight,
that he heard a shot soon after that,
and. that ten men ran, away directly
afterward. ' ' ' ' '
Sheriff Eugene Klnkead. the man
who ended a previous strike in the
bloody "Hook" and "Gridiron" sec
tions within sight of New York
said today he would keep hands off
the strike unless it got beyond control.
Then, he said, he would send in about
200 picked men for a cleanup cam
paign. The - strikers have decreed
death to the police if they invade the
heart of the strike section again. And
"Fighting Dan" says he'll disregard
any ultimatum. f

KANSAS TROOPS START
First Infantry Entrains Today for

San Antonio, Tex., Oct. 13. There
is no immediate prospect for state
troops on border duty to return home
other than the organizations already
under orders. General Funston made
this clear today by pointing out that
all national guard troops remaining
in state mobilization camps have been
ordered out and are taking the place
of an equivalent number that have
been on duty several months. Troops
not relieved in this exchange must re
main indefinitely mobilized unless the
war department changes its policy and

Distress in Mexico Due to
Laxity of Church.
BISHOP URGES UNITED ACTION
Episcopalians of England, Can
ada and U. S. to Join
For Extension of Missions to
Sonth America Nations.
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 13. Thia Is
the day of American missionary op
portunity in the western hemisphere,
the Right Rev. Arthur S. Lloyd of
New York, president of the board of
missions of the Protestant Episcopal
church, told delegates to the church'9
triennial convention today, when he
presenteu t.e report of his board at
a Joint session of the two houses com
prising the convention. He said the
European war has brought North and
South America together in a way
which had not hitherto been deemed
possible. For this reason, he asserted,
the convention should adopt a recom
mendation of the board of missions
that a bishop be consecrated for
Panama.
"What it would mean to lose our
chance" now may be indicated by the
distressing conditions in Mexico,
Bishop Lloyd continued. "One might
almost say that much of the misery
in Mexico today might have been
averted if, fifty years ago, when our
brethren there were asking help, the
church had been able to avail itself
worthily of the opportunity."
Civilization Follows Christianity.
Doctor Lloyd urged the Church of
England, that of Canada and the
American Episcopalians to join mis
sionary forces in the western hemis
phere as parts of the universal church.
He said civilization must follow Chris
tian teachings and asserted that the
United States church is amply able to
provide for it.
"In the American Episcopa
church," he declared, "is accumulated
a generous proportion of the wealth
of the country, and yet important
work for the church is stopped for
lack of money." Bishop Lloyd an
nounced, however, that means had
been provided to meet all obligations
of the board for the current year, and
asserted that the difficulties in raising
necessary funds for the foreign cause
have betn due to lack of business
methods rather than to lack of dona
tion. He drew attention to progress
which had been made in the church
in founding a pension fund for aged
clergymen on sound financial prin
ciples. Force in Foreign Field.
The board's report showed that the
church is supporting nine bishops and
329 other clergy and lay workers in
the foreign field, together with 1,089
native workers, and that seventy-five
wives of missionaries are rendering
service without compensation.
In the domestic field, it said, the
board is aiding sixty-three dioceses
and districts including Alaska, Hono
lulu, the Philippines, Porto Rico and
the canal zone and is supplying the
entire support of twentv-four binhons
and 1,069 missionaries. It was f ur-
ther asserted that since the last gen
eral convention 124 new missionaries
have been sent to the foreign field,
mainly, however, to fill vacancies
caused by death and retirement.

Ex-President Will Assail Adunison
Law in Home of Arbitration.
New York, Oct. 13. Ex-President
Roosevelt, who appointed the Anthra
cite Coal Strike commission and
forced the owners of the Pennsylvania
coal mines to accept arbitration of
their controversy with their employes,
has decided to go to Wilkesbarre to
morrow, and there will declare to the
very miners who were the benefi
ciaries of his insistence on arbitration,
that President Wilson sacrificed the
principle of arbitration when he took
his stand against arbitrating the de
mands of the railway brotherhoods,
that he has injured the cause of or
ganized labor, with the possible ex
ception of the members of the broth
erhoods, and that their advantage is
merely temporary, because Mr. Wilson
has by his course taken negotiations
regarding all questions affecting the
conditions of labor from the unions
and the employers and established the
precedent for fixing them by legisla
tive enactment.
He will claim that the inevitable
tendency of Mr. Wilson's course is to
reduce the labor unions to mere in
surance agencies and that this is a
backward step for organized labor. As
Mr. Roosevelt s friendship for labor for several months,
has been substantially demonstrated, I
his interpretation of the Adamson ' ftl II I fD0 DAI CCPAPCC
bill in what may be regarded as thelrULLUll O ML LOvHrLO
home of arbitration of labor contro- i -
versies is bound to be awaited with
the utmost interest.

Savage Stages Most Successful
Robbery in History in 1906.
Federal, county and city officials
are searching the Union Pacific
freight depot today for loot stolen
from seven sacks of registered mail in
Kansas City.
Charles Savage, alias Charles Stev
ens, alias Charles Stevenson, the same
negro who staged successfully tho
greatest mail robbery Kansas City had
ever known about ten years ago and
who 3erved time in the federal prison
lor it, is charged with the present rob
bery. He is said to be under arrest in
i California.
It developed today that Savage has
bet-n living in North Topeka nearly all
summer; that he went to California
only a short time ago. Altho officials
decline to go into details the impres
sion has been given out that when
government secret servico mn began
to get close to Savage in California ho
shipped his belongings to Topeka.
No one here 'will state the value of
the registered mail Savage is charged
with stealing. It may run into tho
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Fol
lowing the big robbery for which Sarv
age served time, ten or twelve years
ago it was stated that he made away
with money and valuables worth $50,
000. The money was never recovered.
His Strong Box.
In the search made thru Savage's
belonging's today no money was found.
A great deal of plunder of different
kinds was disclosed, as box after box
was opened, but little of It could havo
been sent thru tho mails as registered
matter. One box of an intricate de
sign with a lock which has defied all
.keys to date, may contain something
for which the otneers are searcning.
Becauae of the vsiue of the box th-
officers today hesitated about break-
ing it open. They believe some other
w' hfcjmr opening
when the robbery occurred in Knnsas
City. The search and seizure warrant
secured in order to search Savage's
effects at the freighttdepot states that
seven sacks of mail matter were taken.
It is said that the sacks were rifled
and left in an out-of-the-way place
as was done by Savage on the former
occasion when the J.iO.000 disap
peared. On that occasion the regis
tered mail taken contained a lot of
new money, some of it so new that it
had never been signed, hence waa ot
no value.
May Break It Open.
J. C. Lindlade, federal officer, se
cured the search and seizure warrant.
He and L. L. Kiene, sheriff, and
George Frost, marshal of the court
of Topeka, made the search today.
It is being continued this afternoon.
Unless other matter is found and
identified as having been taken from
the mails, the strong box secured to
day will be broken open.
Among the plunder found in Sav
age's boxes and trunks were several
high-priced cameras and guns of var
ious descriptions. Local officials say
they did not know that Savage was
in Topeka during the summer. Many
other negroes, police characters, nay
i they did not see him. But federal
officers say he lived in North Topeka
