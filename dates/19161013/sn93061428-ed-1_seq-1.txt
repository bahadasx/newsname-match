BITTEN BY RATTLESNAKE.
The little two and a half year old
baby daughter of Chas. Cochran, liv
ing ten milee from Monument waa bit
by a big rattlesnake Monday after
noon, just above the ankle, two deadly
fangs piercing the tender limb. The
baby only lived a short time, dying
Tuesday. Mrs. Cochran took the lit
tle one In Iter arms and ran a mile to
the nearest neighbor for help. See
ing the limb beginning to swell she
took her shoe lace and corded It ab
ove the bite. She had phoned for Dr.
Black and he was soon there, but too
much of the poison had entered the
system and only death ended the lit
tle one's suffering. Mr. Cochran waa
in Carlsbad and a phone meanage rea
ched him here and he went out by au
to Monday. An uncle waa also in
town and went out with him. The
funeral waa held Wednesday. The
family have the deepest sympathy of
the entire community in which the
Current joins.

the chairman of the county bourd of
