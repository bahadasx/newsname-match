BOTH SPEAKERS RECEIVE OVATION
Pray Brings Rounds of Applause From Audience in Referring to
Chas. E. Hughes Next President. Edwards Makes
Governor Squirm.
The Republican campaign in \ alley
county was given a decidedly strong
advancement last Friday evening,
when Hon. Chas. N. Pray and Hon.
Frank J. Edwards, candidates for
United States Senator and Governnor,
fired the opening guns at the court
house in Glasgow. The court room
was crowded, every available inch of >
space being occupied and the hallway
and st airs were packed as well, with
attentive listeners to the messages de
livered. j
T. M. Patten, County Treasurer, act-j
ed as chairman of the meeting and
shortly after 8:00 o'clock introduced
the first speaker. In making the
introduction of former congressman j
Chas. N. Pray, he paid an enthusiastic !
tribute to the service rendered in Con-j
gress by Mr. Pray, during the term
of his office, and predicted his elec
tion this fall as United States Senat- j
or. The remarks of the chairman !
were greeted with applause and the
speaker also received an ovation as
he arose to make his address.
Mr. Pray in his address did not re
sort to loud clamouring or to any j
oratorical flights of fancy for the pur- !
e «»ttor,fir.n His re
pose of holding attention. his îe
marks were those of a man of firm
convictions presenting his case to the
people for their indorsement and the
rapt attention given and the applause
which greeted his statements demon
strated the fact of the argument
reaching home. He opened his ad
dress with a brief reference to his
work in congress during his previous
term of office, called attention to the
enactment of laws, particularly bene
ficial to the homesteader, which made
it possible for so many to obtain
homes in Montana, and was respon
sible to a great extent for the great
influx of thousands to the state, and
outlined the work he did in assisting
to secure the passage of the bills.
A review of the present adminstra
tions errors and the uncertainty of
the position of the President was re
ferred to, as was the fact shown by
Mr. Pray that the so-called Democrat
ic propserity as now existing, is en
tirely due to the great war now be
ing waged in Europe. He cited the
condition of the country for the short
period of time before the war orders
began to reach this country, when fac
tories were idle a good portion of the
time immediately after the Demo
cratic administration went into ef
fect.
He then took up the assertion that
"Wilson kept us out of war" and ana
lyzed it thoroughly showing that this
is an absolutely misleading statement
which will not stand up, in the light
of truth and reason. The convinc
ing manner in which this claim was
shown up as a foolish assertion met
with the approval of the audience as
was demonstrated by the applause it
brought forth.
The 1912 Democratic platform was
given a severe going over by Mr.
Pray and shown up as a mere vote
catching institution. He called at
tention to the many planks in the
platform which had been cast aside
without any pretense of being lived
up to by the Democratic administra
tion, after they had served their pur
pose at election time. In conluding
his remarks Mr. Pray paid a glowing
tribute to Chas. E. Hughes and pre
dicted his election this fall. As the
standard bearer of the Republican
party the mention of Hughes met with
resounding applause as did the state
ment that in him the nation will find
judgment, and ability to cope with
the intricate problems to be met with,
in such a manner as to demand the
respect of every nation.
Hon. Frank J. Edwards was then
introduced as the next Governor of
Montana, and was greeted with a
round of applause as he stepped to
the front of the rostrum to begin his
speech. Mr. Edwards in opening,
mentioned the speech of the Governor j
given the night before in this ci ty,
and called attention to some of the |
things the Governor did not talk about
which he would take up. Referring |
the race track anti-gambling bill
Mr. Edwards showed the Geovrnor did j
not press the passage of this bill un- j
he was forced to do so, and also .
brought out the fact that while mak-1
ir.g a pretense of securing moral re- j
forms he stood by while the Kiley j
boxing law was enacted and became a J
law, thus allowing the state to be re-1
tarded rather than advanced. The |
pledge of the Montana Advancement j
association to secure the Governor's.
support and signature to a defective!
industrial compensation law was sight-j
and the fact that such a law was j
passed and the signature of the Gov- j
ernor affixed to it. The Governor's atti- i
Tax methods and what he termed
the "Steal plant" in Helena was ex
plained by Mr. Edwards by showing
tl.at the Secretary of State received j
salary of $3,000.00 a year and that j
the law provided ne should receive 110 ,
other fees or recompense whatsoever.
He then sighted the fact that the
Secretary of State had sold to the
automobile owners of the state license
lags to the number of 24,000 each
year at a net profit of 52 cents each
adding in this manner to his salary a
sum of *12,000 each year. _ I
Mr. Edwards then stated that if

the state and not any particular in

he assumed the authority to declare '

Mr. Edwards stated in favoritism to
the banks and had prevented a low
ering of interest rates to the farmers (
of the state who were doing real de- j
velopment work in Montana. The

THE BIRTH OF A NATION"
A WONDERFUL PRODUCTION
"The Birth Of A Nation", which will
show at the Orpheum Theatre Friday
and Saturday, was presented at the
Grand Theatre at Great Falls on last
Monday and Tuesday and created as
great a sensation as it did upon its
previous visit to that city. The the
atre was crowded to capacity with
many disappointed by not being able
to obtain admission; S. C. Moore, who
was in Great Falls Monday attended
the production and declared it to be
^ ^ x. • . • , , ,. ,
the greatest pictorial production he
had ever witnessed. He stated the
audience was held spell bound during
every moment of the two and a half
hours, the tention being only relieved
by the beautiful story of love and
pathos which runs through it. An!
orchestra of twenty pieces especially
engaged and trained for this produc
„ . . .
tion furnished a score of patriotic airs,
martial music and folk songs, which
greatly increased the effect and pow
er of the splendid work. Mr. Bishell
is to be congratulated upon his being
able to present this great production
in Glasgow.

en-j of the Democratie administration so
was j n p 0S ^j 0n use their
QWn statements to show the weakness
- j 0 f their claim to responsibility for the
beav .y exports during the past two
years and a half as well as to the
continued operation of factories dur
ing that time
The figures showed there had been
a constant falling off of the amount
of manufacturing productions up to
and for a short time after the great
j war in Europe opened. Taking the
as
its
situation from the time the war or
drs began to be placed with Americ
an manufacturers it was shown that
industrial revival since August two
years ago. The fact was pointed out
that manv of the factories which had

he facture of industrial products rebuilt,
the , and replaced their equipment entirely
! placing machinery for the manufac
\ tu re of shells, ammunition, and other
, war materials. Otherwise these fac

An! Senator Ellsworth used the facts'so
! and figures of the Democratic admin
1 istration in such a straightforward and
I. . 7 « «
; honest dissection of the true condi
| tion as it exists as to leave no room
j for doubt that there has not been any
j real industrial prosperity which can
i not be directly or indirectly attribut
ed to the great war. The wreck of
j tbe tariff schedule as it was finally

° aUSe(1 the * reatest industrial de "
pj-essjon ever witnessed by the United
States according to the statement of
Mr. Ellsworth and his argument fully
! sustained the assertion.
As to President Wilson keeping this
an- 1 country out of war, Senator EUs
worth sighted the present condition
of the American troops protecting the
I border between this country and Mexi-1
co and also the sending of war ves
sels to Vera Cruz and the many humil- |
itating and insulting acts toward the
American citizen. That this coun-j
try had been kept out of war by the
President is one of the weakest argu- j
monts of the Democratic administra
tion and one that they should hesi
tata to use was brought out so clearly
as to make it appear ridiculous to
the average thinking man. That this J
country had been in the most embar- 1
rassing position of any nation as a
result of the vascillitating methods j
perused by the President in the Mexi- 1
can controversy was clearly defined
and the necessity of having a Presi- |
dent of the forcefulness and character
of Chas. E. Hughes was made appar
ent. .
The mention of Mr. Hughes as the
next president of the United States j
met with continued applause '
showing clearly the sentiment of the ;
audience. Throughout the entire ad- 1
dress many demonstrations of approv- !
al were made and the audience was
most enthusiastic. j

K '» this section of the state are to

The Republican County Commi
ington as one of the most able and
powerful men in the senate today.
Senator Norris is essentially a
friend of the farmer and knows thor
oughly the hardships which they go
through. He was born on a farm
in Ohio and his early life was filled
with hardship. His father died when
he was a small child, his only broth
el - was killed in the war of the Re
bellion, and his mother was left in
straightened circumstances. He was
neighboring farmers by the day and j
month during the summer, attending !
district school during the winter. He ;
obtained his college education by
working his way through school. He
was elected prosecuting attorney of :
his county in Nebraska three times, !
an( ' was then elected district judge,,
which position he held until sent to
the national House of Representa
tives by his constituents. It will,
therefore, be especially interesting for
the farmers of Valley county to hear
his speech on October 18th, as they
will be listening to a man who under
