ALEX M'DERMID PASSED
AWAY WEDNESDAY
' ' WAS PIONEER
Alex McDermld, a pioneer among
the sheepmen of Arizona, passed
away late Wednesday afternoon at
the Milton hospital following an op
eration for intestinal trouble with
which he had been troubled for a num
ber of years. It was thought
as a last resort, an operation might
relieve his trouble and Dr. P. G. Cor
nish of Albuquerque, arrived at noon
and later performed the operation
which proved of no avail, as Mr. Mc
Dermld passed away before reviving
from the affects of the anesthethics.
Mr. McDermld retired from the
sheep business several years ago and
settled down with his wife in their
comfortable home on Aspen avenue
to enjoy their friends during the re
maining years of their lives.
Mr. McDermld was a Scotchman by
birth, of a sturdy Scotch parentage
and was 72 years of age at the time
of his death. Ho had weathered many
hardships in the early years in the
northern woods and came to Arizona
when the handling of sheep on the
open ranges, was indeed a man's job.
He was a man of the most lovable
, kind and one who will be sadly missed
,' by those who knew him best.
Arrangements for the funeral had
not been made late yesterday, but it
was thought his remains would be
shipped east to the old home.
"Boa" Acker Believes In Two Terms
"Boss" Acker wishes to advise his
friends that he has not withdrawn
from the race as the democratic can
didate for county treasurer and that
he is willing to take charge of the
county money another year at the
a same price as was paid last year, re
M ' gardlesB of the present high cost of
m living.
He also states that he will not ask
to have the present quarters re
papered or painted In "the next tyro
years if he Is elected. The present
vault will be kept neat and clean for
th reception of the moneys paid in by
the taxpayer, with receipts ready on
tap when a taxpayer comes in with
his money. ' 1
"Boss" Insists that the county
treasurer job has been given out in
two term series and according to the
i rules of the game he Is entitled to
4 another term, regardless of the fact
that this Is a republican year and that
he is a democrat
N Inhumane Auto-Cattle
A buggy In which the daughters of
Fred Garing were riding on their
way home from school, was run into
and badly smashed up Monday even
ing by an auto tourist party. For
tunately neither of the young ladies
were hurt. The touring party, who
ever they were, seemed to be
thoroughbred road-hogs, and after the
accident went merrily on their way
without even waiting to see the result
of their recklessness. There should
be a law permitting the shooting of
such cattle at any season of the year.
Democrat Says East Is for Hughes
E. Power Conway of Phoenix, was
in Flagstaff Sunday and Monday on
his way home from a visit to his old
home in Boston. E. Power Is a natu
ral born democrat, but on his visit
east during the past two months, was
firmly convinced that the people back
there are going to vote for Hughes
for president in large numbers. The
pivotal states .are for Hughes, much
to the chigrin of the aforesaid E.
Power, though he is convinced that
political parties are pretty much shot
up, as it were on the political game;
and that party lines have been drag
ged around until people step over them
with an ease heretofore unknown.
Mr. Conway avers that according
to the Information he received, New
England, New York, Illinois, Indiana
are for the republican nominee, which
would seem sufficient to elect Hughes.
nughes Alliance Club to Organize
A general meeting of all those in
terested In the election of Hughes as
president of the United States, re
gardless of previous political, affilia
tion, is called to meet at the offices of
C. B. Wilson, tomorow, October 14th,
at 3 o'clock p. m. Both women and
men are invited to attend and take
part in the organization of the club.
The club expects to take no part in
local politics but is to be organized
for the purpose solely of helping the
cause of Hughes.

Jcently returned to the United States

cursion rates are in effect from all
points. '
BABBITTS GIVE WINSLOW
EMPLOYEES A HOLIDAY
Babbitt Brothers, with their wide
commercial interests scattered all
over the northern part of the state,
have inaugurated a new system
which will undoubtedly bring splendid
results.
Sunday, the entire force of the
Babbitt Bros.'- Mercantile Co., at
Winslow, was invited to Flagstaff to
go over the big main plant and to get
acquainted with their working force
In Flagstaff, as well as many of the
details concerning the handling of the
great volume of business that goes
through their hands annually.
Over twenty employes of the Wins
low branch were in Flagstaff for the
day, headed by L. W. Quinlan, general
manager; the party consisted of Chas.
Wi Fairfield, Mrs. J. K. Hines, Harold
E. Robinson, of the office department;
Miss Maurine Hackney, ' millinery;
Miss A. Peralta, L. H. Anderson, dry
goods; Henry V. Naylor, men's goods;

It wa sa jolly crowd of employees
and they were given a full day's view
of Flagstaff. After the "get-together"
meeting in which points of
Interest to the different departments
were discussed, the party were taken
to see the big city water reservoir,
the different mills, to the Lowell Ob
servatory and later In the evening
were given a banquet at the Commer
cial hotel. 'Expressions of good will
and exchange of ideas on business
methods were again discussed during
the banquet
The party returned to Winslow in
the' evening with a good working
knowledge of Flagstaff and its sur
roundings as well as beipg well
pleased with the trip afforded them
free by the big concern. '
Prescott Football Team
la Given a Generous Scndoff
The Prescott football team was I
given a most enthusiastic send off' at
the depot Monday evening after the
game at the Normal, by about two
hundred of the Normal boys and girls.
The passengers on the trains going
through guest it right the' very first
time when they remarked: "This must
be a college town." Many an old
timer watched the antics of the jolly
crowd aching to get in and be one of
them again. '
V
New Railroad Commenced
The first steps looking to the build
ing of the Verde Extension railroad
projected to connect Clarkdale in
Yavapai county and Mesa were taken
last week, when a large party of en
gineers and their assistants left Phoe
nix for the Verde, where active sur
veying will start at once.
The outfit consisted of three large
wagons drawn by four-mule teams,
three saddle horses, to be used as
pack horses when the really, bad
country is reached and about 15 men.
Look Out Now, Ducks
The open season for duck shooting
will commence on next Sunday, Oc
tober 15th and about the only safe
place for .ducks on that day will be at
church, for the hunter's will not be
there.
Whether or not duck hunting will
be good around the different lakes,
has not been reported since the deputy
state game warden, Zach Eakins, is
rather fussy about it and seems to
think that the game laws should be
enforced.
Oak Creek Makes High Water Record
County Engineer Power recently
received word from Mr. Fcnstermak
cr, a rancher in the vicinity of Sedo
na, on Oak Creek, that the flood
waters of Oak Creek had run two
feet over the high water mark En
gincr Power's had put up last year.
The righ water did no particular
damage and did not inconvenience
the settlers along the ci;eek.
Flagstaff Republican Club. Meets
The Flagstaff Republican Club met
last Tuesday evening for the purpose
of talking over the resent political
situation and getting together on a
well organized plan of helping along
the present campaign from a repub
lican standpoint.
There was a good interest taken by
those present and there is a feeling
prevailing that the showing made by
the republicans at the coming elec
tion will convince the democratic par
ty that Arizona is not a "cinch" bet
for that element of the people.
BOX SEATS FOR STATE FAIR
MUST BE SECURED EARLY
The box seat sale for the Arizona
State Fair opened October first and
many checks arc already in the hands
of Secretary Shaughnessy, insuring
the reservation of a box for the, big
doings this fall. Twenty-five dollar
checks will be received during the
month of October and the drawing
for boxes will be held at the Chamber
of Commerce on the morning of No
vember first.
The location of boxes will be de
termined entirely by the drawings.
The checks are being recorded in the
order in which they are received and
the drawing will be held in the order
in which the checks were deposited.
Those getting th.eir money down first
will get the opportunity to draw. The
drawing will be conducted under the
supervision of a special committee of
the Chamber of Commerce, which will
guarantee to every person an equal
chance and no favoritism. Any one
living outside of Phoenix or vicinity,
who cannot be present at the box
drawing, should name a represent
ative or proxy when remittance is
made reserving a box.
Provision has1 been made for par
ties wishing to secure two boxes ad
joining, as was done last year. Checks
for the two boxes must be deposited
and the Secretary notified that they
will draw double. The first number
drawn will determine the location and
an adjoining box may be chosen.
This year's Fair is expected to
break all records for attendance and
it is an assured fact that all available
boxes in the grandstand will be taken
before the first of November. Those
wishing to secure boxes should mail
checks at once, as the rush for ac
commodations will exhaust the supply
long before the opening day of the
Fair.
MARRIED TUESDAY AND
LEAVE FOR GRAND CANYON
Mh W. M. Hughes of this city was
married Tuesday morning to Miss
Aarie Graff, , of Iowa, The ceremony
was performed at the Church of the
Nativity in the early morning by Fr.
Vabre and the young people left the
same day or Grand Canyon where
they will spend their honeymoon.
They will make their home in Flag
staff where Mr. Hughes is employed
as deliveryman for Babbitt Bros.
During his' several months residence
there Mr. Hughes has made many
I friends among the people who will be
'pleased to welcome the couple back
to Flagstaff.
The new mistress of the Hughes'
manor is not Very well acquainted
at .present, though she will be wel
comeed by the young people.
Sun Ads. Bring Results '
"My adv. in The Sun certainly
brought results for me; I have been
getting letters from all over the coun.
try concerning it and if I don't sell
it will not be the fault of the adver
tisement," we were advised by an ad
vertiser the other day. He was sur
prised to learn that The Sun reached
nearly every state in the Union, as
well as a number of foreign.countries.
The Sun has the largest legitimate
circulation of any local weekly pape'
in the state, including semi-weeklies,
and we are willing to count noses
with any of them.
J. O. Harrington for Sheriff
John O. Harrington has been re
ceiving a real interesting batch of in
formation from the voters of the
county relative to his candidacy for
the office of sheriff and feels confid
ent that it is going to be a good year
to be a republican.
Judge Harrington docs not claim
that he is the only man in Coconino
county who could fittingly hold the
office of sheriff, but does claim that
there is no reason why he could not
hold down the job in the best Inter
ests of the people and honestly en
force the laws as they are written by
the people of the state.
His statement of the case, ib: "If
the people, of the state do -not want
the laws they are working under, let
them repeal the laws I didn't make
'em, but if elected to the office that
requires the enforcement of laws, I
will do the will of the people, regard
less of consequences; if you elect me,
you know my platform."
He has lived in. Flagstaff and haB
been holding office of Justice of the
Peace long enough for all concerned
to know that he usually means pret
ty much what he says.
His ultimatum strictly construed is:
"Law is law as far as I know and the
people are supposed to make it "to
suit themselves." . H

Normal Excursion to Grand Canyon
Arrangements are being made by
the Normal to run a special train to
the Grand Canyon on November 2nd
in order to give the students an op
portunity to view the great scenic
wonder before they go back to their
homes. Details of the trip have not
been given out as yet
Every year trips are made by the
students under the direction of the
Normal faculty, to points of interest
around Flagstaff. It has a wonder
ful affect not only as an advertise
ment for Flagstaff but for the big
Normal school, which is outgrowing
new buildings a great deal faster
than the great state which brags so
much about the amount it expends
for education, will provide them.
Lamp Post and Auto Collide
Charles Green had a' bad wreck
last Sunday afternoon at the corner
of Birch and San Francisco street,
with his auto. Some part of his
meshanism worked wrong as he at
tempted to frisk around one of those
old yellow hats, and his car went into
the lamp post ker-wallop. No one
was injured but the car and the lamp
post, but both of them are sadly in
need of repairs. ,
Jerri e W. Lee for Recorder
Jerrie W. Lee does not claim to
have had seven years or more expe
rience in the office of the County
recorder, but his friends do claim for
him that he has the ability and ex
perience to do good work and to the
things the people; want done regard
less of their, especial political beliefs.
Doing the things the people pay him
for doing and then a little more to
show them that he is a willing ser
vant of the people who elect him to
do their work, is the plan he has
mapped out for his future, when
elected to the best office in the gift
of the people. All he asks is an op
portunity to convince the people that
he can do their work and not be in
fluenced by his own political prefer
ences in handling the work.
He is willing to handle the work of
the people for the compensation given
him, and has no desire to be the spe
cial sponsor of the whole people as
to what their politics shall, or shall
not be, nor will he attempt to make
it unpleasant for those who may wish
to register in the next two years by
using the especial democratic prero
gatives of his office for the purpose.
He is a young man, a married man
making his way in the great south
west by his own efforts; he is a tax
payer, a citizen who is a credit to the
community in which he lives, and one
who has a heart interest in the coun
ty he lives in, for he has no other
home and Is directly interested in the
people who live here. He is from the
west end of the county, it is true, but
the people of the county, both east
and west are interested in playing
the game square; giving credit where
credit is due. Seven years should be
sufficient to one encumbent
FLAGSTAFF IS THE STOCK
MARKET OF NORTH-
General A. C. McQueen, general
manager for stock shipments out of
Arizona, was in Flagstaff yesterday
looking after the many shipments of
stock that are to be made this week.
Last week two train loads of sheep
and cattle were shipped out of the ,
local stockyards, and two trains will '
be made up again this week for.ehip
ment Heavy shipments of cattle will also
be made the first of the week at Sel
igman by the Sanford Cattle Co., Abe
Kauffman and others in that vicinity.
A full train load of New Mexico
ewes recently purchased by local '
sheepmen arc due to arrive here the
first of the week to fill up depleted
bands. H. C. Hibben will get a bunch
of them, for his range out near Anita.
Shipments all along the line in
Northern Arizona have been larger
this year than ever before. Buyers
have been making Flagstaff their cen
ter of activities and the greater part
of the stock of the north is contract
ed for and sold here and the city is
rapidly becoming the "Little Kansas
City of the West" in the stock busi
ness generally. Few fully realize
how great the stock and cash ex
changes are that annually go through
Flagstaff firms.
SHOT IN FOOT WHILE
HUNTING FOR DEER
George Negray, employed as a
clerk in the Arizona Central Bank,
accidentally shot himself in the foot
yesterday with a 30-30 rifle, making
a very painful wound. Luckily the
bullet struck between the toes and
did not strike a bone, mushroom and
completely wreck.his foot as soft nose
bullets ,do when they strike a bone.
Negray, in company with Joe Rick
el and W. B. Raudebaugh, had gone
to Mormon Lake in the morning in
the Rickel auto in quest of deer. The
party were at least lucky in seeing
a number of deer and would have un
doubtedly brought their share home
had the accident not happened.
Negray was immediately brought
home and the wounded foot attend- '.
ed to by Dr. Schermann. While he
will have to walk soft and low on one
side for sometime, there is not
thought to be any .danger of a per
manent injury.
Business Administration is ,
Pledged if Elected Supervisor
Fred Garing, the republican candi-,
date for the office of supervisor, vol
untarily pledges a business admin
stration for the affairs of the county
if he is elected a member of the coun
ty board.
That his pledge is no idle promise
goes without saying, for Mr. Garing
has demonstrated his business abili
ty in his own affairs and his friends,
who are a legion in Cocoinno county,
fully believe he will carry out his
promises to the letter. He makes no
claims of being a "politician" in any
sense of the . word, but does claim
that he is familiar with the condi
tions in Coconino county and is will
ing to give his best efforts along the
line of getting dollar for dollar of the
amount of the people's money ex
pended for carrying on the business
of the county and in the best interest
of the whole people, regardless of
their special location, east or west.
"My policy will be a fair distribu
tion of the funds for the improvement
of the roads, or for other purposes;
not so much the location, or the taxes
paid, but the necessity for the ex
penditure will count most with me,"
is the way he expesses his idea of
helping to build up a county and do
the most good for the people of the
county.
A Badly Skewed Road Sign
A recent communication from Mr. ,
W. W. Bass, which shows conclusively y
that he is neither a "sucker" or a ,
catfish," states that Mr. Samuel Al
brighton, of Thornton, Iowa, has
sworn eternal vengance against the
man who put up the guide post at
the fork of the Tuba City and Grand
Canyon road, failing to make it plain
which was which road. He and his
party failed to leam-of their mistake
until they had used up sixty miles of
perfectly good gasoline and were told
of their mistake by travelers they
met Road signs, if they are worth
the trouble of putting up, should at
least give a fellow some inkling of
where he is going.
It may be that the sign got i'three v
sheets in thet wfrid" and was thus ,. t
twisted, but some good hatured trav-' 1.
tier onouiu give it a uwh in : unc
right direction.
