PREPARING FOR
FURTHER RAIDS
Several Flotillas Will Leave
Shortly It is Reported to
Make War on Allied
Shipping.
MERCHANTMEN TO BE
ARMED "FOR DEFENSE"
Probable Developments Cause
Grave Feeling of Anxiety
in Administration
Circles.
Interaatlcnal News Service:
WASHINGTON. Oct. 13. British
naval authorities are preparing for
a series of Oi-rman submarine raids
on this side of the Atlantic. It was
learned in diplomatic circles today
that information has reached both
England and France that several
Ilotillas of submarines will leave
Germany shortly headed for this
fdde to make an organized attempt
to halt and sink munition and sup
ply fchips. These vessels will oper
ate in twos and threes to meet the
problem growing out of the fact
that hereafter all Anglo-French
merchantmen will be armed "for
defense."
In order to meet the problem it is
expected here that certain freight
and munitions will be diverted from
jorts south of Nantucket. A safe
r-f"ge will be provided for cargo
ship, probaddy by netting the Hay
of Fundy and Ft. John harbor while
a general plan of naval convoy such
ts now is in force off northern Scot
land and th Irish coast, will bo
made effective.
IVelircr of Anxiety.
It is realization of these probable
developments that has caused the
prave feeling of anxiety In adminis
tration cirrle.s. There is no doubt
the line between cruiser warfare,
us considered legal by the United
States and submarine practices
which have been penalized by Pres't
Wilson with the statement that dip
lomatic relations will bo broken off
If they are re.su med is very minute.
And if a submarine torpedoes a
merchant vessel which has used its
puns for defense it may be hard to
discover exactly whether this action
was justifiable, especially if an Amer
ican citizen sheuld lose his or her
life.
It is expected that Sec'y Lansing
will make another visit to Shadow
Liwr. to talk further with the pres
ident about the submarine situation.
The effect that general submarine
activities would have on American
commerce now is being considered
in the light of sinking of the steam
er Floomersdijk. a neutral vessel
plying between neutral ports. Al
though it is admitted that this coun
try cannot protest in this case that
beim; th duty of Holland it is felt
that it has a direct bearing on any
aurse of action that in.i be plan
ned. And although so far the raid
o the i;-r3 and F-01 has broimht
nc complications to this country,
there Is no attempt to d bruise the
realization that they bavp made the
reneral submarine situation more
critical in bringing the war directly
to the doors f the Fnited States.
Question is ItaLod.
Official of tb.e state department
and the Fnited State- coast guard
today are holding conferences to de
termine how coast jruaid cipters
shall conduct themselves in rescuing
persons and ships, victim" of the
new German submarin warfare. A
perplexing question has arisen as
follows:
Should a cutter seek to rive aid
to a vessel torpedoed by a submarine
and keep it afloat until it could be
towed to port an.l what n-irso
fdiould the cutter pursue if the sub
marine commander mt rpo-ed and
insisted that the sdiip he allowed to
go to the bottom without any at
tempt to ;-.Jd being made?
(awvst guard edhaials are inclined
to the belief that the cutters should
do all possible to save disable. j hips
und aid thdr pris-rncrs ar ! re,
but state department ouViaN do no?
wish to raise an international issue
by Interference in the submarine

International News Service:
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 13. "I

Thomas ll. Marshall, vice presi

pave that answer today, when he was
asked for his opinion re'irdinq
Charles K. I lushes Iusltania dec

"It is easy for Mr. Hughes to say
what he would have done because it
is not within the power of human
intelligence to tell what one man
would have done had he been in an
other's place. He may think he
would have done otherwise, but he
doesn't know it.
"Mr. Hughes was associate justice
of the supreme court when the I..U
sitania was sunk Why did not he,
as associate justice, with his great,
sweeping knowledge of internation
al law, advise the president. That
would have been the patriotic thins;
to do. as lonpr .as he was a part of
the government."

International News Serriee:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1Z. Ex
tremely disquieting reports from
Mexico reached this city today from
half a duzen sources. They indi
cate that (Jen. Carranza finally han
alienated practically all of his for
mer loyal military supporters. His
elimination as a factor in Mexican
affairs is declared to be certain be
fore the lirst of the year. Some of
the reports reaching here have him
actually in flight from Mexico City,
but this is not continued or general
ly credited.
"What the outcome will be if Car
ranza is overthrown is hard to fore
cast. There is little doubt that an
other wild scramble for power with
at least half a dozen entries would
result. Obrerem would be the lead
er from the military standpoint, but
he would control only his own per
sonal following. Villa naturally
would become a factor, while Gen.
Trevino, Felix Diaz and others of
lesser prominence would strive to
get control of the government. All
cf the new facts have been sent to
the Mexican joint commission now
in session in Atlantic City, for its
guidance.
In addition Ambassador-Desig-rate
Arredondo is expected to so
there shortly to tell of conditions as
he observed them in Mexico.
Munitions at llauina.
Agents of the department of jus
tice are watching large quantities of
arms and ammunitions which have
been gathered in Havana. It is
understood here that they are to be
used in a new revolutionary move
ment which will be commenced in
Yucatan. All information regard
ing the men behind this new plot is
withheld. It is understood, how
ever, that the munitions were gath
ered by a New York firm which has
specialized in promoting Mexican
revolutions in the past and ine
Washington representatives have
been in close touch with the leaders
of the former Ciantitico element and
has made many trips to New Yo::k
recently.
It is expected that if any effort is
made t move these munitions to
Mexico for the purpose of armir g
revolutionists, those responsible will
be arrested for violation of neutral
ity. M.'ny military leaders of Mexico
are declared in the reports reachir g
this city to be making terms with
the legalistas. Revolutionary dis
turbances have taken place in tie
states of Sinaloa, Tepic, Jalisco and
Colima and are spreading rapidly.
