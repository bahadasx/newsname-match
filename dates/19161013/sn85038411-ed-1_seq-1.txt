113 th Worry of "You . Un
derstand Me" Windsor
Superintendent of Defectives "You
Understand Me" Windsor and the
members of his bureau haven't been
invited to the "school" which Chief of
Police Wetzel is planning to conduct
for the police, it was said this morn
ing at headquarters.
The police chief said that in view of
the fact that' the Detective Bureau is a
separate department, he isn't going to
have any detectives in the "classes."
which will be for the instruction of
patrolmen only. That Chief Wetzel
means business is evident from the
way he spoke about the instruction
! work which he is planning for his men.
"We're going to see that the officers
know the city ordinances. Discipline
is another thing which I think is
needed. You can't have a force of
| men working with no discipline and
j expect to get results."
113t.1i Worry
But nary a word about the detect
i ives, who are now worrying with their
i one hundred and thirteenth robbery
|in the present series. Early yesterday
morning thieves broke into the lloltz-
I man & Taylor poolrooms. 323 Market
! street, and stole seven billiard balls,
j valued at $7 each. Just to show that
| changing districts, methods and kind
of loot is only a mere trifle. Investi
gations, as usual, "you understand
me," are being made.
How the "hurglarman" got in re
mains to be learned, the police say, but
be went out through a rear door, leav
| ing it unlocked.
Xo T.ongt'r Identify Prisoners
I Superintendent "You Understand
I Me" Windsor when asked this morn
i ing whether his department uses the
j Bertillon fingerprint system of iden
i tlflc-atlon, together with taking pictures
of criminals, made no reply, but hur
ried into his private office with one of
his staff and shut the door.
Chief of Police Wetzel, however, ex
plained that although the detectives
■ bandied that work, he did not believe
they were taking fingerprints or filing
| pictures of convicted criminals from
, ITarrisburg, because the identification
I fund has been exhausted. Ho inti
mated that it was used to make Im
| nrovements about the place before he
become chief of the department. He
j said the Hertillon system should most
| certainly be continued.
Ex-City detectives in speaking of
ithe abandonment of the P.ertlllon
fingerprint system and the "mugging" I
of conyicted offenders, declared that
they considered It unwise for the city
to discontinue the Identification bu
reau. as practically every other city Is
using it.

its purpose to campaign actively for
adoption of the plan by Congress, to

States Chamber of Commerce, com
prising hundreds of chambers

Bread AH Over Country
Either Up in Price or
Cut Down in Weight
Washington, Oct. 13. The extent
of increases in the price of bread, or
decreases in the weight of loaves dur
nig the four months from May 15 to
September 15, is detailed in figures
from 'ls of the country's principal in
dustrial centers made public to-day by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bak
'■rs, in reports to the Bureau gave as
reasons the increased cost of materials
and ingredients, especially flour.
Changes in prices and weights have
been most numerous during the last
two months which the figures cover.
Of 250 brands of bread that retailed
for five cents and weighed fifteen
ounces or over on May 15, only four
teen remained at the same price and
weight on September 15. Some bakers
are reported to have met cost ad-
Nances by discontinuing wholesale
business, substitution of brands, pre
sumably cheaper, and elimination of
the return of stale bread.
Comparative figures regarding
wheat and flour prices and the average
retail price of bread, show that in
September the wholesale price of
wheat was 3 4 per cent, greater on Sep
tember 15 than on May 15, the whole
sale price of flour 37 per cent higher,
the retail price 23 per cent, higher for
the same period, and the average re
tall price of bread was 11 per cent,
