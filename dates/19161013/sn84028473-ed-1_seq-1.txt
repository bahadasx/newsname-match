THE FAULT FINDER
We once heard a colored Bishop
deliver a most powerful address In
which ho contrasted Victor Hugo with
a modern Southern writer He said
Hugo found his characters among the
humblest and sought to find the
crushed flower in the meanest humn
breast and develop it till it transform-
ed the whole man or woman while
tho modern writer sought to find the
tiger in the noblest human breast
and drew It out till It pulled tho man
or woman down
The average political hackwriter
thinks It his duty to look only for
something to criticise and never any
thing to pralso
The painter who would look only
for the blemishes which he could en
large and exaggerate would never en
roll bis name among the immortals
wmie even tne mediocre who painted
only the beautiful would attract at
tention

100 A YEAR
DEMOCRACY OR PLUTOCRACY
Back of every Issue of this caia
palgn Is the irrepressible conflict bc
tween democracy and plutocracy Aro
tho people to rule or Is property
Nobody else has stated that ques
Hon with such clearness as did Pros
Ident Wilson In his Omaha address
when he said
Now the touchstone is this On
our part absolute singleness of
heart and purpose in our alleg
iance to America and then a Justi
fication of that allegiance to Amer
ica by holding the doctrine that Is
truly American that the Sates of
America were set up to vindicate
the rights of man and not the
rights of property or the rights of
self aggrandizement and aggres
sion
Property we have found to bo
the indispensable foundation of
stable institulons but the rights
of humanity are the essence of
free Institulons and nothing can
take precedence of them
It is because Woodrow Wilson has
caught this vision that he is today tho
greatest living leader of democracy
in tnis or any other country It Is
because Charles E Hughes has not
caught this vision that he has willing
ly made himself the servant of prop
erty and privilege In a campaign to
reselze the government of the United
States It Is because the people of
the Middle West have begun to grasp
the meaning of tills contest that Pres
ident Wilson is received there with
tremendous demonstrations of popular
enthusiasm
The United States has never had
greater need of a truly democratio
President in the White House than It
has now of a President who Is In
earnest sympathy with the democratic
hopes and aspirations of mankind
War Inevitably breeds political re
action It was so after the Napoleonic
down fall In Europe It was so after
the civil war in the United States It
was so after the Spanish American
war it will be so after the most de
vastating war known to human his
tory The rising tide of Toryism In
Great Britain is already one of tho
sinister signs of tho conflict
The American people must either
keep their government In their own
hands or submit to being exploited by
every privileged interest that Is In
financial partnership with Wall Street
Republicanism Mr Hughes in this
campaign Is only a mask for the greed
iest hords of financial exploiters that
the country has eer known a hordo
that Is working through the Republi
can organization and is prepared to
take possession of all the machinery
of government for Its own bordld prof
it It Is financing the Hughes cam
paign on a sralp that Mark Hannn him
self never reached and Mr Hughess
election would mean a now saturnalia
of corporation government The In
fluences back of him make it impos
sible that it should mean anything
else
American democracy must protect
itself In this crisis of civilization and
it can protect itself only by re electing
President Wilson The farmers havo
bVgun to see It The worktngmen
have begun to see It The small mer
chants have come to seo It The sal
aried employees are beginning to see
it
All the political resources of finan
cial Bourbonlsm have been thrown
Into the scale on tho side of Mr
Hughes but money and corporation
power cannot win the election If tho
American people are still alive to their
ancient rights and their ancient lib
erties if they aro still keeping tho
old faith
The Wilson policies are a new char
ter of democracy which can bo re
jected only at public peril To return
to the doctrine of government of prop
erty by property for property Is to re
turn to the doctrine that exalted hu
man slavery that justified secession
and that finally gave the United States
over to civil war JT Y World
