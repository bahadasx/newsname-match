streets. They come gratis, simply to
show their good will to Paw Paw, and
let us know that they are "Good Fel

in the country. They are no strangers
to Paw Raw, and every one in the vil
lage and surrounding country should
plan to be out and give them a royal
welcome. A concert by the Rlooming

healthy and rugged. Fishing in any of
the V;in Hureri county lakes will now
be mighty tame sport for him. after
fighting with the big ones in the
northern waters.
SISTER TOWN SEEMS DOOMED
It would seem as though our sister
village of Lawton was doomed. It has
been one fire right after another there
for the past year or more. Last Sun
day night about 12:00 o'clock fire was
discovered in the row of wooden
buildings on the west side of North
Main street. The blaze consumed four
buildings, and it was a hard fight for
the fire department to save the ad
joining stores.
'Is Figbtidf
The Michigan certified grapes which
have been going to the trade from Paw
Raw for the last two weeks, have at
traded no little attention. The num
ber of certified cars has not been large
enough so that all the markets could
be reached nor even large enough to
reach all the carlot buyers in the near
by cities. However, the cars sold have
been received without a kick, although
the selling price has, in most cases,
been higher than for the ordinary se
lect grapes. In a number of cases re
peat orders have been received for
certified stock. Furthermore, the re
peat orders are coming so fast now
that they cannot be filled.
There have been just enough cars to
prove that a higher price can be ob
lained for stock that is truly what it is
represented to be. and is certified to
by some neutral party who is not di
rectly interested in making a sal
There are reasons for believing that as
soon as the merits of certified grapes
become better known there will be no
, ilimeulty in getting two cents more a
basket for the aDOroved fruit and per
haps three cents, and on occasions five
cents.
The above represents the shipper-'
side of certified grapes. The grower
is also interested, and In a financial

it justly merits.
The Majestic theater in Kalamazoo
is even more popular this season than
ever before. The reason is obvious,
the shows are the very best they have
ever been. Take the bills that are
now being shown, it is no wonder that
the theater is crowded to capacity.
"The Luck of a Torem" is the title
of the feature act which will be in the'
electric lights for Sunday and the first
half of the coming week. This is
scenic operetta which will endure for
ever in the vaudeville hall of fame.

Quite the most laughable skit of the

It was written by Mrs. Henry B. Dixey

Wiry, too. The state inspectors who
have been looking into the packages of
grapes that have been brought from
the vineyard the past three weeks re
port that all kinds of grapes from bad
to good have been packed in the eight
poun I and four-quart backets and have
gone into the same cars, except where
proVilion was made for certified stock.
In such eases, the probabilities are
that the fruit has been sold at a price
that would be I fair average for all
the grapes. The extra good grapes
have made Bp for the very bad. The
Certified plan provide! a means where
by the good grapes lhat are well pack
ed are sold at an advance over the
average stock. Such a proposition is
imply the rendering of justice to the
growers who take pride in putting up
I good product.
The certified grape proposition is
taking so well in the cities to Which
certified cars have been sold that the
Orders are arriving for the certified
fruit faster than they can be filled and
the price In each case is from one to
fcWO cents above that for select and
fane grapes. In Chicago on Tuesday
of this week Raw Raw certified grapes
were selling at 2 cents a basket
wholesale, whereas New York select
grapes were bringing but 23 cents.

ALL EXHIBITS WERE SPLENDID
Kill ing was of a high class. Free for
All Pace was the big feature. Won
in record time
The Van Huren County Fair at Hart
ford last week closed on Friday with
a record attendance. It was the most
successful fair in the history of the
organization, and everybody is pleased.
The weather was ideal throughout the
week, which, of course, augmented the
crowds. There were just 36,400 paid
admissions for the week, and on.
Thursday there were a total of 2.104
automobiles parked within the
grounds.
The exhibits of fruits, produce and
the general line of stock were par ex
cellence. Many complimentary re
marks on these features were heard
on every hand. The races, too, were a
big feature. The interest in the races
centered in the free-for-all pace on
Thursday. Laura Lueile, a brown
mare owned in Ligonier, Indiana, and
driven by Hairy Clemens, won the
race. The time of the first mile was
2:09. The middle half of the first
heat was paced in 1:03, a 2:06 clip,
which is going some for a half mile
track.
The auto races on Friday drew an
immense crowd, but the auto racing
on a half mile track is not very satis
factory, and it is doubtful if the auto
races Will again be feature at the
Van Huren county fair. They were
pulled off, however, without accident
and in very good time everything con
sidered. The fair as a whole was most satis
factory from a public as well as official
standpoint. The corps of officials and
everyone having to do with arrange
ments and the execution oi the same
are to be congratulated.
CO. PRESS TO MEET TODAY
The Van Huren County Press Asso
ciation meets today at Law; ton. The
program includes an auto ride through
the vineyards, dinner at the Hotel Gid
dingS, and discussion of the various
topics of interest to the craft. The
question of t lie raise in price of sub
scription will be an important matter
for consideration. The subscription
rate must necessarily raise, and the
only question to be decided is when it
should take effect. A. X. Moulton, of
Decatur, is president, and ( B. Lewi3,
of Lawton, secretary.
HOMER SMITH WON
OPENING BATTLE
Homer Smith, Michigan heavy
weight, won his first battle of the pres
ent season in Philadelphia, Friday
night. He defeated Larry Williams of
that city in a fast six round bout. The
Phialdelphla North American, in com
menting on the fight, says: "Smith
surprised the fans by his speed and ag
gressiveness. He kept nicely ahead of
Williams until the opening of the fifth
round, when he sailed in to win by a
good margin. He floored Williams in
the fifth and had him all but out when
the final gong rang."
Smith reports that he has plenty of
fights ahead and a lot of money in
light. The season looks like a good
one.
