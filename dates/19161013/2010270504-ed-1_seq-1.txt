Overcoat
K 1
IN
O longer necessary to buy two
overcoats one for business and
rouch wear, and the other for
formal and social events.
The Noclidbout Overcoat more than
takes the place of both coats and serves
its purpose better made of heavy over-
' coatings and in a variety of weaves,
colors and fabrics that possess all the
style, character and expression of the
prevailing overcoat models.
By leaving out the linings, which are unnecessary the
Nockaijoiit is stripped of some of Its-costbut not of its
icbrnfbrj or war(hth, style or service, '' " , ".
As an overcoat for cold and stormy days it can not be
beaten and it is equally appropriate at the club, theater,
thejdance or social function. Low jn cpst, excellent in
.service, dependable in quality, it offers more in the way
of style, service, comfort and convenience than any other
garment selling at the same price.
