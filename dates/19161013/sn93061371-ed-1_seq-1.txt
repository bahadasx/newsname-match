Mexican Problem
Art itlfiritarice:
in the minds of Republican
politicians and editors there is
considerable confusion with re
spect to modern American-Mexican
history. Some of I hem
seem to think that the Mexican
problem 13 the Creation o? the
Democratic administration, tlutt
it is a "Wilson Problem." The
truth is it is America's problem,
and it was as much a Taft
problem as it has been a Wilson
problem, and in the event of
Mr, Hughes' election it would
be tt hughes problem. It is very
ikety -that as Mr. Wilson hand-fed-the
pro'bleHi much as Mr.
Taft did, Mr. Hughes' method
of handling it would not differ
materially from that of Mr.
Wilson.
Let us take a glance at thi
record. Mr. Taft became pres
ident on Mrch 4, lflO'J. Within
twenty months after Mr. Taft's
t1 d nornrn f Jrm . trniitilo id sa1-frJi!l
I . . M. U. . . W ... 01.1
form broke out ih Mexico; and
during all of the balance of his
administration, this trouble continued.
On November 8, 1910, there
was rioting in Mexico City. The
American nag waa destroyed,
the windows of American resi
dences and business- l.odses were
broken: A streetcar containing
American fechorjl cliiidien was
8'oned and the son of the Unit
ed States ambassador was as-
aulted. These disturbance
continued two or three days,
On November 10th there was
rioting in Guadalajra, The
American flag was burned and
the windows of American banks
and stores wei8 broken. Thesr?
disturbances continued two or
three days.
On November 10, 1910, there
was rioting at vaiious points in
Mexico. .Ametican consulats
were wrecked and the records
of the consulates were destroy-
ei.

general disorder ill Mexico.
On March 7, 1911, twenty
iho.naand United States regu
lars were ni)b'i!ie3 alng the
Mexican border.
On Anrill 13. 1911, Mexican
forces took Agua Frieti, j)

Americans were killed a lid five

On April 4, 1912, Mexicans
again attacked Agua Prieta.
half the town of Douglas, Aii-
aona, wis under lire of Mexi
call guns. On that occasion
seven Apioiicans were wound-
d. Govern r Sloan of Arizona
called upon President Taft for
the p;o ectloH of Americans.
The president replied declining
to lake military action.
On October 10 and 11. 1911,
Mexican rebels attacked and
captured Juarez. One thous
and American troops patrolled
the Ameildah boide!' and In LI
Pa'?o,- Teias, five Americans
were killed cLiid seventeen
wounded.
On May 12. 1911, Secretary of
State Knox sent to Mexico City
a note denying that the United
States intended to Intervene.
On March 2r, M riiles were
sent to the AmeHoail legation in
Mexico City for the .protection
of American citizens Ameri
can culonis't.-i In Northern Mexi
co nocked across the border,
and there was great damage to
American property by the Mex
ican molly.
On April 14, Ml tile state
depaitliient warned Madero and
Orozco against further olitrflges
to American lives and property.
That all occurred prior to the
presidential election of IS'12.
On December 4, 1912, Presi
dent Taft, in a message to con
gress described his Mexican pol
icy of ''patient non-intervention."
' .
On February t), 19151, there
was an uprising against tin
Mexican gdvernltient in Mexico
Cily. Many days of the street
righting followed. Several bun3
dred Mexican civilians were
killed, including two Amsrion
women.
It was in February, during
President Tafi'a administration,
that Madero was killed and
lluerta demanded recognition;
but there was no recognition of
lluerta and no ititei veniion
under the Taft administration.
On March Is, 1911, a few
days more than two years after
President Taft was inaugurated
and about two years before his
term expired, President Taft
addies-ed a letter to the chief of
stall", and in that letter ho de
clined to do the very things
Republicans are now denounc
ing President Wilson for not do-
Followir g is an extract from
President Taft's Letter:
"The assumption by the press
that I contemplate intervention
on Mexican soil to protect
Americin lives or property, is
of course gratuitous, because 1
seriously doubt whether I have
such authority Indeed as

border ill Meaico in the mouth
of the Colorado rivet' to save the
itfp'erial Valley, although the
insurectors h2?e tcattered the
Mexican troops and were" taking
our horses and supplies and
frightening our workmen
awaf,"
On April 17, 1011, the gover
nor of Arizona sent. a. telegram
to the president, reading in part
a"? f.l!ws:
4 As a result of tvday's fight
ing across the international line,
but within gunshot range of
the heart of Douglas, five Amer
icans were wotmdud on this
side of the line , , In my judge
ment radical measures a-.s need
ed to protect our innocent peo
ple it will be impossible to
safeguard tho peo;?le of Doug
las unless the tovTnby vacated.
To this telegram President
Taft replied as follows: t
'Tho situation might justify
mo mi ordering our troops across
the border,, ,-, but if 1 take this
step, I niUjt face the possibility
of crealer resistoince and great
er bloodshed, and also the dang
er of having our molivt-s mis-
constiv.wed and misrepresented,
and of thus infi lining Mexican
popular indignation .... It is im-
D08ibln to foreste or reckon the
consequences of such a course;
and we must use the greatest
self-restraint to avoid it. I can
not therefore order the troops at
Douirlas to cross the border, but
I must ask you and the local
authorities in cas the same
danger occurs, to direct tho peo
ple of Dougla '. to pi. ice them
selves where bullets cannot
reach them, and thus avoid
castiality."
The only difference between
the Wilson policy and the Taft
policy was that Mr. Wilson
called it "watchful waiting,"
while Mr. Taft called it "patient
non-intervention." (bee Mes
sage 1912.)

"Are we, or are we not, going to
have a game tonight? -If you'd rather
hava a quilting bee, where everyone
cat! talk his head off. we might ar
rango It."
Anthony put out ft protesting hand..
"An right James, I'll plaj- right now
and won't Jmy another word." ,
"And secretly tickled to death,"
snapped Mr. Podderlngtoti, moving hi
queon's pawn two spaces wl(h a Jerk.
''Vhiti your relation arrivetf that
racaiis ati nd to all this. I hope you
realize."
Mr. Saxon looked bis wretchedness,
Podderington decided t(t cbanga tac
tics.
"AM right, Toney, don't worry. We'll
n it M way. I have it! I'll send
for one of fcr(bV& boys to visit me.-
Anything over twenty, say. There
now, drop the v.hole thing and play!"
Tho week before Mr. Anthony Sax-
ton received the disturbing news of
his granddaughter's visit, Mrs. Tom
We&tliorby happened to look out of
her livlng'tootn window Just as Vir
ginia Weatherby and Harold: Harcourt
parted company.
Mrs. TViatherby's keen eye de
tected something iu his manner that
Made her bristle with indignation. And
wheil Virginia came in with blazing
cheeks and SI )appy light In her
deep blue eyes, the" in her moth
er's heart overfiower Its bounds.
"Virginia, this nonsense between
you and Harold Harcourt has got to
stop. Your Grandfather Saxton would
never permit it. You must remember
your duty to your family.- If we al
lowe4 such a thing as a marriaga with
anyone Ot tho Harcourt family, we
should be cut Off without a cent."
And after a heart-to-heart talk with'
Mr. Weatherby, it was decided that it
was time to remind Grandfather Sax
ton of their exlstenco anyway, and Vir
ginia's trip was planned.
"Virginia," said Grandfather Saxton
Across the prodigious dinner table the
first evening, "an old friend is cowing
tonight to play cards."
Something in her sad face made it
hard for hint t suggest that she make
any effort to entertain a strange young
hi a n at his bidding.
The 1J man felt misgivings. "Pod
derington'S an old fool!" he exploded
suddenly, to Vlrglna's surprise and
wonderment. "Look here, Virginia,
he's bringing a young cub ot a grand
son of his aloug for you to entertain.
You look him over and if you tfou't
like him say no and out he'll go."
At eight o'clock precisely, a motor
BoUHdod upon the drive, then came a
few loud tap of the knocker. In an
other instant. Mi. Jarnes Podderington
came into the room followed by a
yClingr man, who stopped soddenly
when the girl got up from her chair
and turned to meet them.
"Virginia!" he cried, starting for
ward. "Harold!" cried Virginia at the same
moment and looking as though sha
were undecided whether to faint or
rush headlong Into the arms he was
iiiahitigjt apparent who quite ready
to receive her. But the color In her
cheeks made it plain to Grandfather
Saxton that her recent Indisposition
was not due entirely to poor health.
"Huh huh! Vhats all this?" cried
Mr. Podderington.
"They seem to know one another,
Jim," ventured Anthony. "Virginia,
this is Mr. Podderington. Now pleas
tell us the Joke" and who It's on. Sit
down, everyone.'
"Yes, yes! And time's flying. PleastJ
ba quick!" added the other old man
Impatiently as he looked at the clock.
"I'll toll you," put in Harold, noting
Virginia's beseeching look. "Virginia
and I love one another and have for
years. But she isn't allowed to look at
me for fear Mr. Saxton will disinherit
the family, and to tell you the truth,
grandfather, I'm not supposed to look
at Virginia, for dad says mother will
never get a sou from you if I marry a
Weatherby. That's the truth!"
"Rot!" exclaimed Mr. Podderington.
"I'll disinherit the whole lot of don
keys If you don't marry her that's
what! Tony, are the things never
coming? We're late beginning our
game."
"Yes, James, right away! You young
folks go Into the library now and talk
about your troubles. And, Virginia,
you write to your mother in the morn
ing and tell her I've picked your hus
band, and his name's Harold Harcourt.
You move first, James!"
