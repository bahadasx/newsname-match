LEGALITY OF U-BOAT
ATTACK QUESTIONED
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PUZ
ZLING OVER PROBLEM PRE
SENTED BY SUBMARINE.-
Washington, D. C., Oct 12.—Govern
ment officials today were pondering
the question of whether the United
States shall acknowledge the raid of
the German war submarine U-53 on
allied shipping off Nantucket last Sun
day as legal. The problem was con
sidered of great Importance.
Much forethought was being given
to potential developments, such as that
German undersea boats might be able
to extend their operations to such an
extent as to effect practically a block
ade of American ports, or that the
allied powers might decide to press
harder their claims that entry of Amer
ican ports be denied -all underwater
craft of belligerents. Resting on de
termination of this nation's attitude
toward the work of the U-53 is the
matter of soliciting indemnity for
American cargoes lost with the sunken
ships. Only if the ships were sunk
illegally may claims be entered.
The navy and state departments
were making efforts to expedite re
ports on tho various phases .of the
raid.
ilfKINGSTONIAN NOT SUNK.
Washington, D. C.. Oct. 1^.—Rear
Admiral Gleaves, commanding the At
lantic destroyer flotilla, reported to
day bis personal belief that no steamer
Kingston or Kingstonlan was sunk by
the German submarine during its
operations off Nantucket lightship.
After several days of search the
destroyer force has found no evidence
that a ship of that name was in the
vicinity and if Admiral Gleaves' theory
is correct, only five ships were sunk.
Th« search has been discontinued.
MAY PATROL COAST, M#
Washington, D. C., Oct. 12.—While
no immediate steps are in contempts
tion for the actual establishment of a
naval neutrality patrol along the At
lantic coast as a result of the German
submarine raid, the njtvy department
has completed a definite plan to be
put into operation if the campaign con
tinues.
The entire destroyer force, active
and reserve, assisted by light cruisers,
navy
tugB
IS
and other auxiliary craft
will be employed to protect American
territorial waters and also to prevent
the establishment of any secret bases
ashore or communications between
shore radio staUons and belligerent
craft."
The possibility of mobilizing the
force of Jrtrately Owned motor boats
along the coast which have been en
rolled with their crews as a part of the
naval reserve was first considered
but various obstacles were encounter
ed. Naval militia officers and men al
ready have been assigned to reserve
ships for service if necessary,^
SHIPS READY TO SAIL

cuss Training of Junior
Officers.
du
Washington, D. C„ Oct. 12.—Presi
dents of nineteen colleges and univer
sities have been called in conference
by the war department preparatory to
establishment of systematic methods
for training reserve officers for the U.

will meet at the army war college here
next Tuesday for\dlscussion with the
army general staff of military courses
to be organised in institutions desiring
to take advantage of provisions of the

must maintain a corps of 50,000 par
tially trained Junior officers to facili
tate organization of an adequate mili
tary force should the nation have war
with & power capkble of attempting in
vasion. The main source of supply for
these officers would be institutions
with approved military courses where
military training under army officers
is part of a student's work.
National guard organizations com
posed entirely of college students have
been mustered out of the federal ser
vice so those men may compose the
first Increment of reserve officers to be
drawn under the new plan.

HUGHES DENIES HE
STANDS FOR WAR
8TIR8 WEST VIRGINIA CROWDS
TO ENTHUSIAM MANAGERS
ARE JUBILANT.
Pikeville, Ky., Oct. 12.—Charles E.
Hughes spent today in Kentucky. His
program called for a day of short
speeches, rear platform talks and an
address at Louisville tonight.
Mr. Hughes,spent half an hour here,
the longest stop of the day. His pro
gram also provided for addresses at
Prestonburg, Paintsville, Louisa and
Ashland. The nominee's train Is due
at Louisville at 8 p. m., and he will
leave three hours later for Springfield,
Mo., where he will speak tomorrow
afternoon.
ANSWERS WAR ALARMISTS.
Charleston, W. Va., Oct 12.—Charles
E. Hughes crossed the Appalachian
mountains last night and entered the
Ohio valley, asserting with proud de
termination that be is not a man of
war, but a man of peace.
He came into West Virgina, held by
the republican leaders to be no longer
doubtful, and spoke to enormous
crowds at Huntington and Charleston.
He was in rare form. So were the im
mense audiences that heard him. The
tone and character of the receptions
given to the republican nominee were
such as to warrant the assertion from
the Hughes managers on the train
that the "break" tof the republican
campaign has arriml and henceforth
until election day it will be a proces
sion to- Hughes and Fairbanks.
Mr. Hughes hurled back at Senator
James and other democratic spokes
men their charge that a republican
victory means war.
This Is what Mr. Hughes said in re
ply to the "peace or war" argument
that the democrats have produced
against him:
"The other day it was said that the
alternative of the present policy of the
administration was war—that any one
who undertook to criticise that action
must necessarily favor war.
"I am a man of peace, and it is be
cause I desire to see American peace
safeguarded that I insist upon a firm
and unflinching maintenance of Amer
ican rights and such policies as win
deserve and hold the psteem of the en
tire world."
This brought a roof lifting storm of
applause from the 10,000 who listened
at Huntington.
"The policy of a sound enforcement
of known rights Is not a policy of
war," he continued. "It is a policy of
security. It is a policy of self-respect
When this nation forgets the dignity
of its own citizenship and the rights
of its own citizens It will enter upon
a period of decadence will Invite in
sults and will surely end in over
whelming disaster. No party can
stand before the American people and
say that it will not maintain Ameri
can rights. And I propose that this
shall not slntply be said, but that it
shall be done."
