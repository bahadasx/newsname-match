heading southwest,
' At their rate of speed, he says, they
must be off the coast toy now. The
Hesperus' captain had not heard of
th German submarine's raid on Sun
day, as there is no wireless equip-
Tnnt on his ship.
His report was coupled today with
that of pilots who were in jaassacnu
sotts Bay yesterday that three torpe
doboat .destroyers cruised off this
coast all day. One pilot said he
thought they were British vessels.
Another said they were American.
Ashore, it was believed they were
American destroyers on patrol duty.
Belief that they were British de
stroyers was held -by many waterfront
authorities who connected their ap
peasance with the fact that it was
only yesterday that British vessels at
this port moved ut, after being held
since the submarine raid off Nan
tucket Sunday.- The British de
stroyers, they contended, came here
to act as convoys for ships of that
nationality.
