within three of being an even 2,000,
a gain of 242. Other districts in the
county bring the grand total to 3000
and over. When Miss Goebel took

Inherits is a bunch of dobts and

they can.
A matter of great interest ia the
establishment of a road camp cast ox

construct a new Borderland route
running east on Spruce stret to Chris
Raithel's farm, thence north one mile,
keeping south of the 8. P. railway to
Aden, there to connect with the Dona
Ana eonnty road already built. En
gineer French approves this work and
its a oinoh that when the cooperate
with French they don't go far wrong.

day and eonferred with Engineer Mc
Guire and J. T. Kelly, his team fore
man, who are pushing tba work.

ing waa done, be made permanently
good, wrioh views conform with the
leaa of the new board.

Stuart Jennings Seriously Injured
Wednesday morning the six year
old aon of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Jen
nings walked down the alley leading
to the rear of the Douglas residence,
oceupied by Capt Pegram, and aa he
is a great lover of horses, the little
fellow crawled through the fence to
see tha Captain's saddle horse, evi
dently frightening the animal so that
he kicked him m the face, breaking
his lower jaw and inflicting a bad
flesh wound. Mrs. Jennings heard
the child cry out and was horrified
on reaching the spot, to see him, as
she must have thought, fatally injur
ed.
The unfortunate little fellow waa
taken home, where Drs. Vickers and
Hoffman placed his head in a plaster
cast. The operation was successful
ly performed, but as liquid nourish
ment is the only kind that can be ad
ministered, the struggle for suste
nance will be a hard one.
