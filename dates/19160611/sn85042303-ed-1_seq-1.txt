that it is my paramount duty

"You speak at a time of

The acceptance message is
regarded as an important dec
laration of his policies and
platform. The acceptance is
XX rathey lengthy. Continuing,
Xt Hughes says:
"I stand for Americanism
that knows no ulterior pur

single and complete. Whether
native or naturalized, or what
ever race or creed, we have
but one country, and we won't
for an instant tolerr.te any
division of allegiance. I believe
in making prompt provision to
secure absolutely our national
security. I believe in prepar

for our defense with respect
to numbers and equipment to
the end that in each branch
of the service there may be
the utmost efficiency under the
