ThU Mean. That There Will
Be Two Ticket in the Field
Insures Wilson's Election.
Supreme Court Justice Charles
Evans Hughes of New York hat
been selected by the Republicans as
their presidential candidate, having
been nominated on the third bullot
at Chicago yesterday morning after
conference committees named by
the Republicans and Progressives
had failed to agree upon a compro
mise candidate.
After having received a telegram
from Roosevelt stating that Senator
Lodge was the only compromise can
didate acceptable to him, the Pro
gressives met and nominated the
Colonel as their standard bearer.
A later telegram from Roosevelt
declared that he would make no
statement as to whether he woulJ
support Justice Hughes until he
had read his letter of acceptance.
Roosevelt had previously stated,
however, that he would under no
consideration support the Supreme
Court Justice, and it is generally be
lieved that he will accept the nomin
ation tendered him by the Progres
sives, and -make the race as their
candidate. '
The entrance of Roosevelt in thi
raco as the Progressive candidate
means that the Republican vote will
be split, just as it wu four year,
ago, and the re-election of President
Wilson will,, naturally follow.
The Angel of Death visited the
home of Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Ellis,
one mile northeast of Columbus, on
Friday morning at 11:45 o'clock,
and carried away their darling little
daughter, Alice Elizabeth, who wa
about the age of five. This was their
only child and by her death they
have lost one of the brightest and
prettiest children of the city. The
Commercial joins their many friend?
'in extending to them heartfelt sym
pathy. Funeral services will bo held from
the family residence this afternoon
at 2:30 oclock and interment will
take place at Friendship cemetery.
The following girl friends of the
deceased will act as pull bearers:
Misses Mary Perkins, Katherine
Donnell, Hazel Vandiver and Hinton

born of patriotic motives and should
enlist the interest and command the
participation therein of the people of
Mississippi, and that they may be re
minded of the anniversary and that
the recognition thereof may become
more general, I, Theodore G. Bilbo,
governor of Mississippi, do issue this,
my proclamation, commending to the
people of the state the due and ap
propriate observance of June 14 as
the anniversary of the creation of
the flag of our common country as

ings of liberty, peace and happiness

folds.
