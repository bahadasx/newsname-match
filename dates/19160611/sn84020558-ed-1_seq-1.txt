Hughes, former governor of New York
and until todny justice of the supreme
court of the United States was today
nominated for the presidency by the
republican national convention.
Charles Warren, Fairbanks of Indi
ana, elected vice president with Theo
dore Roosevelt in lWi, again was
c hosen for second place on the repub
lican ticket.
Moth nominations, made by over
whelming majorities on the first bal
lot of the day the third ballot of the
convention were by acclamation
made unanimous. "
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts
presented by Roosevelt as a compro
mise candidate. received several
votes. Colonel Roosevelt himself re
ceived IS and one-half scattered over
1 states.
The nominating ballot showed this
count:
Hushes, 94: Roosevelt. 18;
Lodge, V: Du Pont, 5: LaFollette, 3;
Weeks, 3; Absent 1. Total, 987.
Despite the fact that Frank H.
Hitchcock, leader of the Hughes sup
porters, let It be known while the
presidential balloting was in progress
that the Hughes men wanted Burton
for second place. Ohio withdrew Bur
ton's name leaving the field to Mr.
Fairbanks and former Senator Btir
kett of Nebraska.
The ballot for vice president showed
this count:
Fairbanks. 8fi3: Burkett, 108; Borah,
f; Burton, 1: Johnson, 1; absent,
scattering and not voting, fi. Total,
987.
Mr. Hughes will be notified of his
nomination officially at a date to be
fix?d later bv a committee headed
by Senator Warren G. Harding of
Ohio, chairman of the convention.
Mr. Fairbanks will be notified by a
committee headed by Senator William
R Borah of Idaho.
At 2:01 p. m. the convention ad
journed. There wer expressions of
harmony from all the leaders among
the delegates.
The nomination of Mr. Hughes was
made possible so soon by an overnight
breakup of the allied favorite sons
combination which early this morn
ing released Its delegates.
When the convention hea-m business
shortly before noon the withdrawal of
the favorite sons was announced from
the platform one after another as
votes began flopping into the Hughes
column In solid blocks so rapidly that
the nomination plainly was assured
before the roll call had gone five
states. When It got to Colorado the
drift was so apparent that a proposal
to make it unanimous or nominate
him by acclamation was made, but
Chairman Harding ruled the 'balloting
should take its regular course. The
votes piled up until New Jersey car
ried it passed the: required 494.
In rapid succession as the voting
wept on lu Pont was withdrawn by
Delaware Illinois withdrew Sherman,
Ohio withdrew Burton, Iowa withdrew
Cummins, New York withdrew Root,
Massachusetts withdrew Weeks.
Then Senator Weeks and Senator
Lodgepledged loyalty to the nominee.
At the final analysis of the nomin
ating hallot showed that Hughes had
drawn his votes from every state in
the union and rvery territory, that
Boosevelt s had been scattered over
twelve states: that Du Pont's five had
come from South Carolina; Lodge's
seven from North Carolina and the
final three for Senator "Weeks had
come from Massachusetts and Missou
ri. Although the convention when it
nominated Mr. Hughes had no word
that be would accept and no state
ment of his position, one came along
after the convention had adjourned.
The former justice had kept to his
determination to utter no word in his
own behalf, to make no new an
nouncement of his position on issues
nnd to say nothing which might be
construed as becoming a candidate
while he wore the robe of a justice in
the world's greatest court.
Before the ballot was taken today
t Senator Smoot of Utah announced th
- report of the latest meeting of the
republican conferees with the con
ferees of the progressive convention
disclosing that the republicans had
permitted the name of Mr. Hughes
for their consideration as a candidate
on which both conventions could
unite. He also read the reply of the
progressive conferees which' merely
was an acknowledgement of receip
of the proposal. Then he read Colonel
Roosevelt's telegram to the progres
five convention which had been
brought to the Coliseum by John Me

Before he had finished the reading

telegram ringing with denunciation
of the administration's foreign policy
and declaring for a dominant, thor
ough going Americanism, he gave his
decision to Chairman Harding of tiie
republican national convention and
broke the long silence which had kept
the leaders of his party in the dark
as to his attitude toward the gieat
issues of the day.
"I have not desired the nomination"
said the telegram. 'I have wished to
remain on the bench. But in this
critical period of our national history,
I recognize that it is your riijht to
summon and that it i.-s my paramount
duty to respond."
Within an hour after Chairman
Harding had notified him of his nom
ination Mr. Hughes had accepted the
call. His resignation a scant twn
l'ne letter without a superfluous
word, was on its way to the White
House from the Hughes home before
the laiminee had dispatched the mes

will 'go on the stump or who he will

MUeHtiuns that have not been gien

In hia telegram of acceptance, Mr.
Hughes announced his stand "fur the
firm and unflinching maintenance of
all the rights of American citizens on
land and sea;" for "an Americanism
that knows no ulterior purpose, for a
patriotism that is single and com

all thoroughness to the end that in

CI IIC AO 0, June 10 The
republican national conven
tion tocljay nominated
Charles Evans Hughes of
New York and Charles W.
Fairbanks of Indianapolis
as the candidates of their
party for president and vice
president.
Almost at the same mo
ment Theodore Koosevelt
was nominated by the na
tional progressive conven
tion and later in the day
John M. Parker of Louisiana
was named as his running
mate.
The republican nomina
tion took a ballot, the third
of the convention, while the
progressive nomination was
made by a;-claniation.
Mr. Roosevelt's present
declination to accept the pro
gressive nomination is be
lieved by the politically wise
to leave the door ajar, if not
wide open, for the eventual
withdrawal of the third
ticket in the event Mr.
Hughes' position on what
the progressives feel to be
the vital issues of the cam
paign meets their approval.
To this extent at least the
! leaders in both parties feel
that the efforts at harmony,
even if not directly fruitful
of result mav vet be realized.

The national committee elected an

to be held was taken as an indication
that no settlement had been reached as
to whether Colonel Roosevelt's name
would remain on the ticket.

AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO, June
-Colonel Roosevelt was nominated
today by the progressive national
convention after four days of uproar
and tumult In which the delegates
never wavered in allegiance or cast a
passing glance upon another man.
Three minutes before the conven
tion adjourned until another time.
Chairman Raymond Robins read to
them a brief message from Oyster
Bay in which Mr. Roosevelt declined
to accept the nomination at this time.
Few of the thousands in the vast
auditorium, some of whom had seen
the colonel named in an even wilder
burst of enthusiasm four years ago,
realized when Robins rapped his
gavel at 4:58 and declared the con
vention adjourned sine die, that in a
few hours or a few weeks they might
be a party without the one leader
to whom they had come to Chicago
to give the pledge of loyalty and
faith.
The significance of Colonel Roose
velt's message with its announce
ment that if the progressive national
committee found the subsequent
statements of Charles Kvans Hughes,
the republican standard bearer, to its
liking, his non-acceptance of the pro
gressive nomination should stand as
his last word, was lost in that tired
throng, worn out by its own en
thusiasm, by long delays over some
parleys with the republicans, and by
the discussion of a platform on
which it must go into the field, if at
all, against both the forces of dem
ocracy and republicanism.
None of the feeling that some of
them later betrayed when they had
opportunity to digest the colonel's
statement had time to flare out when
the gavel fell. They trooped out into
Chicago's streets for home while the

(Special to The Republican.)
CHICAGO, June 10. The cur
tain has been rcng down on one of
the greatest dramas of the political
history of the United States.
While Charles E. Hughes has the
ricminstion, as a result of a final
combination between Frank Hitch
cock ?nd the old guard leaders,
who took Hughes only because
they hated him less than they did
Roosevelt, the Colonel is still, the
arbiter cf the situation. Should
lie decide to run on the progressive
ticket, Hughes' election would be
impossible.
The old guard has absolutely
gambled on Roosevelt's ardent
patriotism, relying on him to prom
ise not to run against Hughes.
Plans May be Overturned

OYSTER RAY, June 10 When Col
onel Roosevelt summoned the news
paper correspondents to Sagamore Hill
at six o'clock tonight he told them he
had tentati.vely refused the progressive
nomination for the presidency and that
he had nothing to add to what he had
said in his message to the convention
at Chicago in regard to his present
position.
He told something, however, of the
steps which led up to his message ear
lier in the day suggesting that repub
licans and progressives unite on Sen
ator Henry Cabot Lodge as a com
promise candidate. At four o'clock
this morning he said,, one republican

Grande ns to make improbable the
success of any raid De La Rosa might
undertake.
All three conferees, he said, seemed at
that time to be agreed that such a
step would be satisfactory. He de
clined to name the republican member
of the committee other than to say he
had been a supporter of Justice Hughes.
Colonel Roosevelt sent his telegram
of refusal to the progressives before he
had Justice Hughes' statement. Later,
when asked if he had any comment to
make on the Hughes statement he
replied: '
"Not a word; not a word about
anything."
Colonel Roosevelt said he probably
would have no further statement to
make until after the progressive na
tional committee gets together to de
termine what attitude it will assume
in regard to Justice Hughes' candi
dacy or learns something further in
regard, to the republican nominee's po
sition on the questions Colonel Roose
velt considers the most important now
before the country.
After he had ended his talk with the
correspondents, Colonel Roosevelt was
asked by a photographer to step out
on the lawn that a new picture might
be taken of him.
"No picture," the colonel stated em
phatically. "I am out of politics."
