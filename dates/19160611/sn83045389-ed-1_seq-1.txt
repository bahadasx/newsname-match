Captain John M. Parker, of Louis

the selection being by acclamation.
Colonel Roosevelt's running mate of
four years ago. Governor Johnson, of
California, refused to let his name he
placed before the convention because
of the information he had concerning
the intentions of Colonel Roosevelt
toward his nomination.
Chairman Robins carefully empha
sized the Colonel's statement that he
could not accept the nomination "at
this time."

IN I'llOFOU.N'D CA1..M |
In profound calm the brief message |
was quickly read. The proposal to
have the national committee decide the
question involved met bitter silence. 1
At the conclusion there was a burst
of applause, but of no great duration
or extreme intensity.
James R. Garfield moved that the
convention accept Colonel Roosevelt's
proposals and refer them to the na- j
tional committee with power to act.
Chairman Robins hurriedly put the I
question. A substantial vote of "ayes" j
followed in a faint scattering of "noes." j
In the confusion that followed, as the
delegates began to leave their scats
and rush for the exits, the motion
adopted to adjourn was inn filed in a
noisy turmoil.
Excitedly discussing the dramatic de
nouement of the tumultuous political
battle and Its possible effects on the
political history, particularly of the
Progressive party, the delegates de
parted with the last words of Colone
Roosevelt and stirring patriotic airs by
the band ringing in their ears.
Soon after the convention met, while
the delegates were clamoring to nomi
nate, Chairman George W. Perkins, of
the conference committee, made his
report. He recited last night's meeting

Justice and Accepts Repub
lican Nomination.
NO PLANS MADE FOR SUMMER

Their Cards.
WASHINGTON, .tun" 10.?Charles
Evan? Hughes stepped down to-day
from the Supreme Bench, and accepted
the Republican nomlnatIon for Presi
dent. In a telegram denouncing the
administration's foreign policies and
declaring for a "dominant, thorough
golna: Americanism," he gave his de
cision to Chairman Harding, of the
Republican National Convention, and
broke the long silence which had kept
the leaders of his party in the dark
as to his attitude on what they term
ed th<- great issues of the day.
"I have not desired the nomination,"
the telegtani said, "I have wished to
remain on the bench. Rut in this
critical period of our national, history,
1 recognize that it is your right to
summon and that it is iny paramount
duty to respond."
Within an hour after Chairman
Warding had notified him of his nomi
nation. Mr. Hughes had accepted the
call. His resignation, a scant two-line
letter without a superfluous word, was
on its way to the White House frotn
the Hughes home before the nominee
had dispatched the message of ac
ceptance and called the waiting iiroup
of newspaper men into his study to tell
them of hi." decision. President \\ il
son accepter! the resignation in a re
ply almost as brief.
"I hereby resign the office of :>sso
clate Justice of the Supreme <'ijurr of
the 1,'r.ite.i States," Mr. Hughes wrote.
To which the President replied, "1 am
in receipt of your letter of resignation
and feel constrained to yield to your
desire. I. therefore, accept your resig
nation as justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States- to take effect at
once."

When copies of both the telegram to
f'hl-.-ago and the letter of resignation
hnd been made public, Mr. Hughes
left ht> home for his customary af
K-'noon walk. Soon after his return
l.iwreiice Green, his private secretary,
told him of Colonel Roosevelt's con
ditional declination, of the Progressive
nomination Mr. Hughes sent word
to inquirer? that he had nothing to
say concetning it. His friends, l*ow
e\? r, werr '.utspoken in ".heir satisfac
tion o' er Colonel Roosevelt's attitude.
No plans have been made by the
n iminee for the cummer. The family
h.vl ;.ri?' ti- ally dismantled tins Six
teenth Street residence he*c. intending
to return to Maine for the hot months,
but those plans have been abandoned.
Whether Mr Hushes will y> on the
stump or who he will select to man
age hi.? campaign are questions that
have not been considered so far.
Event:! transpired with dramatic sud
denness at the Hughes home to-day
as a climax to monotonous weeks of
waiting It had been thought that
thtnqx would mote swiftly, but few of
the candidate's closest friends believed
the day's developments would crowd
his resignation from the bench, his ac
ceptance. of the nomination, and his
declatatlon of principles into the space
of little more than an hour.
Throushout the precon vent ion cam
paign. Justice Hughe* had insisted that
lie would not lie nominated. Not until
last night after the balloting began did
he admit xo his intimates th^t he
might he drafted to lead his party.
Kven then he maoe no statement as to
what action he would take, but his
silence was interpreted as meaning he
would accept, certainly if the action of
the convention were practically unani
mous.
IIIT.HKS HOt'SEIIOM)
GOES ALONG AS t St.VI.
As the balloting was resumed to
day the Hughes-household went along
almost as usual. Only the justice nad
abandoned his office on the first floor
and retired to the privacy of the third
floor, with Mrs. Hughes and their lit
tle daughter, Elizabethi The eldest
daughter Miss Catherine, had gone lo
take a lesson from a tutor, and Miss
Helen was in New York preparatory to
leaving on a Young Women's Christian
Association tamping trip The only
son. Charles E. Hughes, Jr.. a lawyer
in New York City, was a*, the Platts
hurg military camp.
There was no news from Chicago ex
cept iuch as filtered in with the ar
rival of newspaper men or was tele
phoned by local newspaper offices. Even
as to that Mr. Hughes left word with
his secretary that he did not ':are to he
inforn ed Qf the vote by States, but
wanted only the summary.
Reft.re the balloting began, tele
grams began to arrive, predicting the
nomination and extending congratu
lations. At 1 o'clock lunch was an
nounced for the family, and a little
later came the dispatch, announcing the
nomination. Mr. Green, tl.e secretary,
mounted the stairs three at a time.
"I simply told the Justice he had
been nominated and turned my back,"
he remarked later
Newspaper men crowded Into the
justice's office seeking an audience. Mr.
Hughes came down lo the reception
hall, tear? in his eyes and a tremble in

CHICAGO, ILL, June 10.?The Flo- :
publican and Progressive parties to-|
day carried into effect the programs)
outlined in these dispatches three days i
ago, when.Charles K. Hughes was nom
inated on the first bnllot taken to-day :
by the Republican convention, and |
when Theodore Roosevelt was placed ?
at the head of the Bull Moose ticket ?
less than an hour later.
This failure on the part of the "har- i
monizers" can mean but one thing, j
Unless it is healed by some truly j
Rooscveltlan legerdemain, it means the
overwhelming re-election of Woodrow
Wilson and four more years of liemo- j
cratio rule. The leaders of each of the i
minority parties, of course, realize this. !
That is reflected pointedly in the grave !
and undemonstrative fashion in which !
the Republicans went about their work :
this morning'. A pall of gloom seemed
to rest heavily upon them, but, withal, I
a grim determination to see the tiling
through, whatever may be the outcome
of the campaign.
At no time to-day did the Republi
can convention show that enthusiasm
which has in past conventions marked
such a proceeding. One by one the j
"favorite son" candidates were, with
drawn from the contest, and even when
It became, apparent that Mr. Hughes
would receive the nomination by prac
tically unanimous action, there was
only the most perfunctory applause.

At 2:01 r\ m. the convention ad

harmony from all the leaders and
among the delegates. The delegations
which on the final ballot had cast votes
for others than Mr. Hughes made state

I am very much pleased, of course."

made possible so soon by an overnight
break-up of the allied favorite sons'
combination, u l*ch early this morning
