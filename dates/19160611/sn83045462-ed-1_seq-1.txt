Immediately.
Making a smashing attack on
the foreign policies of the democratic
administration, including
its lack of action in Mexico, and
a virile and thrilling exposition
of the ideal of Americanism,
Charles Evans Hughes, for six
years associate justice of the Supreme
Court of the United
? States, vesterdav laid aside his
robes of office, resigned from the
bench in a two-line letter addressed
to President Wilson, accepted
the nomination of the republican
party for the presidency
and broke his long and dramatic
silence upon the political state of
the country.
A private citizen once more, the distinguished
jurist telegraphed to Chairman
Harding of the republican national
convention, in answer to a message
informing him of his nomination,
that he had not desired the nomination,
but that at this critical period of the
nation s History ne recognized tne republican
party's right to summon him
and his "paramount duty to respond."

that will deeply appeal to the members
of the progressive party, and one
that must hava an important bearing

A perfect flood of congratulatory
messages reached Mr. Hughes yesterday
afternoon and last night from the foremost
men in the United States, al
though nothing was received from Col.
Roosevelt up to the usual bed-time hour
of Mr. Hughes Lawrence Green, Mr.
Hughes' secretary, told the nominee of
the republican party of Col. Roosevelt's
conditional declination of the nomination
of the progressive party, and although
Mr. Hughes had no comment to
make, his friends announced themselves
as jubilant over Col. Roosevelt's attt*
tude.
It was said at Mr.. Hughes' home last
night that he has not yet made plans
for the campaign. These, it is believed,
' will await conferences with party leaders.
to follow, naturally, within a few
days, although it was said last night
that no engagements along this line
have so far been made The only prediction
that was made last night as to
Mr dlughes' movements within the next
day or two was one to the effect that he
w ill probably attend services today at
Calvary Baptist Church, of which both
lie and Mrs. Hughes are members.
Former Secretary Aids Him.
Robert H. Fuller, who was secretary
to Mr. Hughes when he was Governor
of New York and who came here yesterday
of his own accord to be of assistance
to his former chief, if possible,
and who did assist in handling the immense
number of telephone and telegraph
messages received, returned to
New York, his home, last night.
, Some members of the Supreme Court
of the Cnited States communicated
With'Mr. Hughes in a congratulatory
way yesterday afternoon and last night.

to the court, and Mrs Brandeis. called
at the Hughes home. Justice McKenna

For the first time In a long period Mr.
Hughes did not participate in a conference
which is held every Saturday
night before decision day when the
Supreme Court is about to adjourn.
The members of the court gathered at
the home of the Chief Justice. The
opinions Mr. Hughes was preparing
and assisting to prepare as associate
justice have been turned In to the
Chief Justice and he has before him a
clear field as a private citizen and the
republican nominee.
Fresident Wilson accepted Mr
Hughes resignation in a letter almost
ss brief as the one he received. The
President also read the statement comprised

"No picture; I'm out of
politics," Col. Roosevelt said
yesterday afternoon when the
newspaper photographers at
! Sagamore Hill asked him to
step out on the lawn for a
new picture that might be
used in the campaign.
When asked if he had any
comment to make about the
statement of former Justice
Hughes he replied:
? "Not a word about anything."
Col. Roosevelt's statement

OYSTER BAY, N. Y. June 10.?When ]
Col. Roosevelt summoned the newspaper

6 o'clock tonight to tell them he had 1
tentatively refused the progressive (

nothing to add to what he had said in 1

He told something, however, of the <
steps which led up to his message
early in the day suggesting that progressives
and republicans unite upon (
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as a compromise
candidate. At 4 o'clock this
morning, he said, one republican and

CoL Roosevelt sent his telegram of
refusal to the' progressives before he
had read Justice Hughes' statement. .
Later, when asked if he had any comment
to make on the Hughes statement,
he replied":

thing."
Col. Roosevelt said he probably would
have no further statement to make until
after the progressive national committee
gets together to determine what
attitude it will assume in regard to
Justice Hughes' candidacy or learnfc
something further in regard to the republican
nominee's position on the

BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, 111., June 10? As
the republican national convention
of 1916 passes into history it
leaves vivid impressions of its
works and acts upon minds of
leaders and laymen.
Probably most deeply imprinted
upon their consciousness are the
facts that the regular organization
of the republican party is rehabilitated
; that the party has a
i j-e t-Li.
piaiiorm wnicn is acccptauic iu
the conservatives and not susreptible
of righteous assault by .
:he more radical element; that it
s not amenable to the charge of
'steam-roller" practices in any
stage of the proceedings, nor
saint of either intimidation or
torruption.
Door* Open to All.
The contents among the delegates
vere negligible in number and devoid
>f effect upon party organisation in
lie future. I
No act of the convention closed the
loor aglfhst any republican, however j
adical. who may desire to support the <
icket and the platform. ]
Ma ..nnoantlnn in thd r*AOl1*i>tlnn ftf _
;he veteran leaders has been more
larmonious, more expeditious in proseduYe
and more thoroughly businessIke
than the one which closed today.
Another fact which stands out
prominently is that the regular republican
party has not passed Under the
lomination of Col. Roosevelt. It oou^d
not be captured by him, and found.no
occasion to yield to him voluntarily.
With every expression of friendliness
to him and willingness to treat with
tiim, the convention manifested a
ipirit of independence of his will that
tvas most marked.
T. It. Missed Opportunity.
He did not even dictate the nominee,
but let the opportunity pass. If there
was a time this week when by taking
\ stand he could have nominated either
Root, Burton, Weeks or Fairbanks, no
>ne can explain why he did not. except
upon the general belief prevalent that
up to the last moment he was obsessed
with the idea that he would yet be
nominated by the regulars himself.
When be did come with his suggestion
of Senator Lodge, it was too late,
rhe regular republicans were by that
time hopeless of reaching a working
agreement with the progressives, were
llscouraged by the radicalism of the
bull moose convention, and were de- termined
to carve o^t their own convention.
I
Final Chance Offered. I
When the nomination of Mr. Justice

n the daybreak hours of Saturday
norning. the decision was also reached
:o proceed regardless of Col. Roosevelt,
Llthough one more effort, perfunctory
it best, was made to touch elbows with
he progressives.
It is the disposition and judgment of
he leaders, no doubt to be reflected by
he laity, to go ahead calmly with prepirations
for the campaign, regardless
>f Col. Roosevelt's further course, al:hough
always keeping the door open
for his co-operation and assistance
should he see fit to proffer it.
If he decides to be hostile, they will
-egret it, but it will not dismay them,
et alone deter them. They would prefer
his friendship, but will not quail before
his enmity.
Prompt Acceptance Pleases.
Mr. Justice Hughes' prompt announcement
of his acceptance of the
nomination was hailed with delight by
the convention. It was regarded by the
leaders as a happy stroke. For one
thing, it disposed of the suggestions
that have been put forward that Mr.
Hughes would be afraid to run if the
:OIOn?l n"anua a uuiuhk iickci.
They were all the more delighted ?
when they read the message of the (
colonel to the progresalvea. They had
calculated upon hla declining to accept
offhand the nomination of the
bull mooters, I
It now devolves on the colonel. It Is
said, to decide whether he wants to be
a republican or a bolter. Mr. Hughes
and the republican party are not halting
to await the making up of his
mind. Responsibility for his course
and Its effects upon the party rests
upon the colonel, It is claimed, without
amelioration or qualification.
Fairbanks' Answer to Defiance.
The seleetlen of Mr. Fairbanks as
Vice President Is. construed In Its In- '

eptlon and Its unanimity to be further
iemonstration of the fact that the
Puslness and conservative elements in
Ihe republican party are dominant in
the leadership.
In a measure it was answer tot the
lehant attitude of the bull moosers.
rhere was full disposition, in case the
progressive convention manifested a
lestre for reunion, to give them recpgnttton
in a marked manner on sec>nd
place on the ticket.
The republicans, however,.relieved of
uch necessity, consulted their own
nterests. Mr. Fairbanks' nomination
vas also recognition of the importance
>f Indiana in the campaign and of the
Ight for the two United States senaorships
in that state.
The delegates of the republican nailonal
convention are leaving Chicago

victory in November and full of light

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. June 10.?
Radiant, supremely happy, sparkling of
e.ye and clear of voice, overflowing with
rare, good humor, and chuckling with
laughter, former President Taft, in the
Union League tonight, exulted over the
nomination of Justice Hughes for President
on the republican ticket, eulogized
the candidate, intimated that he
would take the stumt> for him. if asked
to do so, expressed a fond hope for a
united republican party, approved the
party platform, predicted that progressives
would fall into line for the
ticket, and said he hoped Col. Roosevelt
would support .the nominee.
But Mr. Taft acted more elated over
the elimination of Col. Roosevelt from
the republican nomination than he appeared
happy over the nomination of
Justice Hughes. He was enthusiastic
in his indorsement of Charles W. Fairbanks
for Vice President. Mr. Taft
came to Philadelphia today from Washington,
and was a guest at dinner in
the Union League. Tonight Mr. Taft
delivered the address at the graduation
exercises at Temple University.
Sends Telegram to Hughes.
Not content with giving out a praising
interview for the newly nominated
republican candidate, Mr. Taft sent
Justice Hughes a telegram this evening
in which he heartily congratulated
him on being the nominee, and expressed
the hope that he would be elected
President next fall.
"What do you think of Mr. Hughes?"
was the first auerv that met Mr. Taft
from newspaper reporters.
"Justice Hughes is the highest type
of man for the office," was Mr. Taft's
prompt response. "He is essentially
an American, a statesman and a
scholar." continued the former President,
in discussing the man he appointed
to the United States Supreme
Court bench in 1910. "Justice Hughes
was on the Supreme bench and was
fortunate in being able to bridge the i
unfortunate breach of 1912. He is a '

CHICAGO. 111., June 10?The republican
national committee, which met

the nomination tonight, adjourned
without having appointed a member of
the committee from the District of Columbia.
The question of District of (Columbia
politics, so far as the republican
party is concerned, may be the subject
of examination by an executive committee
of the national committee, which
is yet to be formed. The national committeemen
from the District may not
be appointed until after the formalities
of waiting upon the nominees have been j
gone through with. The national committee
looks upon the District of Columbia
situation, following the bitter
rows which ended in throwing out all
representation on the floor of the convention,
as something in dispute to be
settled when the executive committee
makes a report to the full national
committee. Members of the committee
would not express any opinion one way
or . another tonight as to whether,
Chapin Brown would be reappointed
from the District of Columbia.

a most kindly, but very effective man- T

and appeared to intimate that what he
thought of the progressive party would
not look well in print, nor would it be
permitted to go through the United
