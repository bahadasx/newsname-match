placed in the hands of the Progressive National Committee. It Mr. Hughes's statements when he makes them shall satisfy the committee that
it is for the interest of the country that he be elected, they can act accordingly and treat my refusal as definitely accepted. If they are
not satisfied they can so notify the Progressive party and at the same time they can confer with me and then determine on whatever

Hughes, Accepting, Speaks for
Patriotism, Single and Complete
Washington, June I". Justice Hughes'* telegram to Chairman Hard?
ing of the Republican convention follotos:
Mr. Chairman and Delegates;
I have nol desired the nomination. I have wished to reniain on the beneh.
But in this critical period in our national history, 1 recognize thal ii is your
right to summon .ind thal it is my paramouni duty to respond. ^ ou speak ai
s time of national exigency transcending merely partisan considerations. Vou
voice the demand for ? dominant, tho rough-going Americanism with firm,
protective, upbuilding policies essential to our peace and security; and to thai
call, in thiscrisis, I cannot t'ail toanswer with the pledgeofall thal is in metothe
service of our country. Therefore, I accepi the nomination.
I stand for thc firm and unflinching niaintenance of all the rights of
American citizens on land and sea. I neither impugri motives nor underesti
mate difficulties. But it is most regrettably true that in our foreign relations we
have suffered incalculably from the weak and racillating course which has been
taken with regard to Mexico a course lamentably wrong with regard to both
our rights and our duties. We interfered without consistency, and while seek?
ing todictate when we were noi concerned we utterly failed to appreciate and
discharge our plain duty to our own citizens.
tt t).r. i-autsH of tlie Administration tbj hiffli responsibilit.es of our diplo
matic intci'coiirse with foreign nations wWA siihordmatcd to a conception of
partisan rcqiiiremcnts, and we presented to the world ? humiliating ipectacle
of ineptitude. Belated efforts have not availed to r-*rcover the influence and
prestige so unfortunately sacrificed, nnd brave words have been stripped ol
their force by indecision.
I desire to see our dip|oniae\ restored to its hest standards and to have
these advanced; to have no sacritices of national interesi to partisan expedi
r ncics; to have the first ability of the countrj always at its comrnand here and
abroad in diplomatic intercourse; to tnaintain firmly our rights under interna?
tional law, insisting steadfastly upon all our rights as mutual and fully per
forming our international obligations, and by the clear correetness and just
ness of our position and our manifesi ability and disposition to sustain them to
dignifv our place among the nations.
I stand foran Americanism that knows no ulterior purpose: for a patriot?
ism that is single and complete. Whether native or naturalized, of whatevcr
race or creed, we have bui one country and we 'lo not for an mstani tolerate
am <li\ ision of allegiance.
I believe in inaking prompl provision to assure absolutely our national
securitv. I believe in preparedness, not onlj entireh adequate for our de?
fence uith respeei to numbers and equipmeni in both army and navy, but
with all thoroughness, to the end that in each branch of the service there maj be
the utmost efficiencv under the most competent administrative hcads. \\ c are
devoted to the ideals of honorable peace. We wish to promote all wise and
practicable measures for the just settlement of international disputes. Inview
,,f our abiding ideals, there is no danger of militarism in this rountry. XS e
have no licy of aggression, no lust for territory, no zeal ror stnfe. lt is in
this spirit that we demand adequate provision for national defence, and wecon
demn tl.e inexcusable neglect that has been shown ... this matter of first natiorml
imijortance. We must have the strength which self-respecl demands, the
strength of an efficieni nation ready for every emergency. Out preparation
must be industrial and economic as well as military.
(lur severesi tests will come after the war is over. We musi make a fair
md wise readjustment of the Uriff, in accordance with sound protective pnnci
plcs to insure our economic independence and to maintam American standards
of living Wemusi consene the just interests of labor, realizingthal in a de
mocracv patriotism and national strength musi be rooted in even-handed justice.
ln preventing, a- we must. unjust discriminationsand monopolistic practices,
we must still be n alous to assure tl.e foundations of honesi business.
Particularly should we seek the expansion of foreign trade. We must
nol throttle American enterprisc here nr abroad, bui rather promote it and
take pride in honorable achievements.
We must take up the serious problems of transportation, of interstate and
foreign commerce, in a sensihle and candid manner, an<l provide an enduring
basis for prosperitv bv the intelligent use of the constitutional powers of Con
?_???< ss. so as adequately to protect the public on the one hand, and, on the other,
I,, consene tl.e essential instrumentalities of progress.
I stand for the principles of our civil service laws. ln even department
of governmenl the highesi efficiency musi be insisted upon. For all laws and
programmesare rain without efficieni and impartial administration.
I cannot within thc limits of this statement speak upon all the suh i
thal will require attentbn. I can only say that ! fully indorse ti- platform
\ (?u h.*i\ e adopted.
I deeply appreciate the responsibility you impose. I should have
^?lad t?. have that responsihility placed upon another. Hut I -hall uud< rtake
to'ineet it. ^rateful for the confidence you cxpress. 1 sineerelj trust that all
formerdifferencesmay be forgotten and thal we may have united eflfori in i
patriotic realization of our national need and opportunity.
1 have resigned my judicial offlce and I am ready I un
n senedlv to the campaign.

FAIRBANKS AGAIN CHOSEN
FOR VICE-PRESIDENCY
Coloncrs Declination Conditional on Hughes
Deelaration of Prineiples?Old Guard
Fears Refusal of Support.
fFrom a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune 1
(hicago, June 10.?Hughes and lairbanks b> praetieally a
unanimous \ote were cho>en thi-; afternoon as standard-bearers
'in 1916 bv the Republiean convention. Justice Hughes was
'nominated on the third ballot by a vote of 919'.. to 101... for
Roosevelt.
Hardly a moment later. in a rush to anticipate the Republi?
ean action, (olonel Roosevelt was made the nominee of the Pro?
gressive convention. ('olonel John M. Parker. of l.ouisiana. was
chosen as his running-mate.
Oespite the presence of Ihi- third tirket in the fiold. the
prospects for union between the IWO parties are greater to-night
than at an\ time while the con-.entions were in progress. (olonel
Roosevelt himself led the way b\ tentativeh refusing the Pro
gressi.e nomination.
While (ieorge W. Perkins pnd the conservatives were des*
perately trying to delay the action of the convention. a miMlft
was received from (olonel Roosevelt at (hster Biy, and later
read lo the delegates. lt follows:
'To the Progressive (onxention: I am \er\ grateful
for the honor you confer upon me b> nominating me as
President. I eannot aecept it at this time. I do n<?t know
thc attitudeof the candidate of the Republiean partv toward
Ihe \ital questions of the da>.
"I herefore. it >ou desire an immediate decision. I must
decline the nomination. Hut. if >ou prefer it. I suggest that
my conditional refusal t<> run he placed in the hands of thf
Progressive National (ommittee. If Mr. Hughes's state
ments. when he makes them. shall satisfy the committee
that it is for the interest of th? cnuntr> that he be elected.
the> can act accordingly and treat my refusal a- detinitely
accepted.
"If the> are not satisfied. the\ can so nolif> the Pro*
gres-.i\e part> and at the same time they can confer with
meand then determine on whatever action we ma> -*ev?*i ally
deem appropriate to meet the needs eel the countr*.."'
With vi-ible reluctance on the part of the Western radical-.
Ihe PrOfreM-Vefl accepted Roosevelt's plan and authori/.ed the
ational (ommittee to fill an\ \acancie- on the ticket. Thus to
night a new political situation has heen created, a-lmost as ah
-orhing as that nn the eve of the conventions.
COLONEL STILL A slROM. FACTOR.
Roosevelt, thnugh heaten. continues to be a dominating
tigure. He has it in his power to elect Hughes or to continue
W ilson in the White House. for even the most sanguine prophet
does not predict ?__) other resuh m a three-cornered race.
As Justice Hughes's statement accepting the nomination
began to be read and discus>ed in the lohbies to-night there wa
a more optimistic Ueling. amounting almost to certaint... that
the Progressive ticket would be withdrawn. Something of that
buoyant spirit born of the prospect of \ietory, so notieeabh lack
ing in the convention itself, began lo manifest itself. Cneerful
nesfl hegan to -how itself in the crowds. and delegates started
for home much mme hopclul than the> had come.
