vention.

City officers, U. C. T. officers, guests
of honor, Minneapolis Newsboys'
band, twenty-tour councils, the Minot
K. F. band. Company D, North Dako
la ..ational Guard, the Boy Scouts,
the Minot fire department and a dele­
gation of women in automobiles made
tup the long procession.
Elect Officers.
Mothers were extolled by the dele
gates and resolutions passed urge

The following officers were elected:
Grand counselor, G, M. Peterson,
Duluth grand junior counselor, J. I,

selor, W. L. Grasse, Fargo igrand

grand sentinel, Frank Tonskemper,
Stillwater, and grand executive com­
mittee, G- E. Tisdale, Minneapolis
C. A. Hitchcock, Crookston, Minn.
To Have Aged Home.
One of the important steps taken
by the grand council was the inaueur
ation of a plan for the erection of a
home for aiged and indigent members
of tbe organisation. Many of the
councy» now ha,Ve fuqd.s available
and a stock ^bifipuny will ibe organiz­
ed and these -funds together with
(what others may be added, will be
utilized in the erection of a splendid
home for the jurisdiction of Mihne
jsota 4nd North Dakota.
The resolutions adopted were in
part as follows:
Resolved That the general legisla­
tive committee be continued and the
"grand councilor be authorized to ap­
point five members, 'three from Min­
nesota and two from North Dakota,
and that said committee be instructed
to prepare measures for the introduc­
tion into the legislatures of Minnesota
and North Dakota, or before the prop­
er body constituted to handle the mea­
sures contemplating the sale of 2,000
mile 'books good on all roads of the
Western Passenger association.
Resolved That the efforts of the
Minnesota state dairy, food and oil in­
spection departments to uphold and
make effective the hotel inspection
law now on the statute books of Min­
nesota, are by the grand body thor­
oughly appreciated. May they con­
tinue, and be adopted by our sister
state in this jurisdiction if she pos
sesse& such a department.
Resolved That the recommendation
handed to this committee by one of
the sitting floor members as to indi­
vidual effort looking to increase of
membership of the order for 1917 is
appreciated, for only by growth, do we
obtain full right and stature. But we
as a committee cannot endorse each
and every member of the grand body,
obligating him to ideas- embodied in
this resolution. Believing that no
home ties and all that they mean, and
recognizing that in the establishment
of the National Mothers' day much
has been done to (perpetuate that high­
est type of woman expressed in moth
erhood be it
Resolved, That in session assem­
bled, we emphasize our consecration
of this day in the remembrance of our
mothers, the dearest friend we ever
can ha.ve, by urging every member on
this day to wear the accepted flower,
the carnation and be. it further
Resolved, That whenever possible
each member fortunate enough to
have- a mother living, send to her a
floral tribute, and that to make this
more possible, and certain, every sec­
retary when so requested, is instruct­
ed to see that this wish is complied
with. .When not convenient to the
member, he often being far from,
home, we suggest that a stated
amount of money be sent with com­
plete address and instructions for de­
livery be it
Resolved, That on the last meeting
previous to Mother's Day, a notice
shall ibe given to each member of
each council that its observance may
not toe neglected, and that where
mothers live in far away states an in­
terchange between secretaries be es­
tablished.
Resolved, That this committee dep­
recates the action of the North Dako­
ta State Fair association at Fargo in
conceding exhibition space to mail-or­
der houses, believing that efforts
made to further entrench such insti­
tutions in the northwest can only con­
tribute to the tearing down and de­
moralization of general wholesale
trade.

SLIGHT FIGHT ON
AGAINST MARSHALL
St. Louis, June 10.—Out of the ech­
oes of the Chicago convention there
came tonight the sound ol' advancing
hosts of democracy that are to meet
here next week to name the standard
bearer3 of their party lor the presi­
dential campaign. The advance
guards came in scattered groups
from Michigan and Illinois and their
numbers will be augmented by tomor­
row.
All diqcussionB centered on nomina­
tions made at. Chicago, and what ef­
fect and bearings they would have-on
the campaign. Chairman McCombs
declared no matter what slate had
been selected in Chicago by either of
the parties, it would not have effect­
ed the plan of the democrats to re
name Presiden Wilson and Vice-Presi­
dent Marshall.
The renaming of Wilson and Mar­
shall after the 1092 delegates have
adopted a platform, which in the
main has been sketched by President
Wilson, is expected to be carried
through without a hitch by Friday
night or Saturday morning.
The names of one or two other can­
didates beside that of Mr. Marshall
may be presented at the convention,
but are expected to be withdrawn be­
fore the first roll call is concluded.
Gov. Elliot Major of Missouri is a can­
didate for vice-president, and reports
have it that the names of .Gov. John
H. Morehead of Nebraska, and Sen­
ator Robert Owens of Oklahoma, will
be put forward.
"There is not a storm cloud in
sight," said Chairman .McCombs to­
night, "and the convention will be
harmonious in every way."

Maurice Williams Convicted by
Jury in Fargo Federal
Court.
F-argo, N. D., June 10.—Maurice
Williams of St. Paul, declared guilty
by a federal court jury of violating
tbe Mann white slave act, was sent­
enced by Judge C. F. Amidon to fif­
teen years in federal prison. Wil­
liams was found guilty by the jury
that considered his case only fifteen
minutes, agreement being reached on
the first ballot.
The transportation of Lucile El
berts from Si. Paul to Minot, N. D.,
several weeks ago, as well as trans­
portation of Marguerite Keller from
St Paul to Minot at the same time,
formed the 'basis for the charges
against Williams. He was declared
guilty on both counts.
Miss Keller, whose revolting story
of her association with Williams, was
almost entirely responsible for his
conviction, related series of trips with
Williams, the first being from Ogden,
Utah, to San Francisco, where she
charges that Williams forced her into
a life of shame.

Washington, June 10.—President
Wilson remained in the White House
throughout today, receiving reports
on the republican and progressive
conventions, putting the finishing
touches on his draft of the democratic
platform and conferring with the
democratic political leaders. The on­
ly important thing occurring was the
reception of the resignation of Jus­
tice Hughes of the supreme court
No formal comment on the selection
of Justice Hughes or Col. Roosevelt's
conditional refusal of the progressive
nomination was made at the White
House, and it was said none would
be forthcoming. The president's clos­
est ad isers did not expect the Colo­
nel to be a candidate on the progres­
sive ticket, but made no secret, of
their hope that, he might. They in­
sisted, however, that his refusal
would have no effect on the demo­
cratic campaign.
Trend of Campaign.
The trend of the present campaign
speeches will probably be indicated
in his addresses Tuesday, at the West
Point graduation exercises and at a
flag day celebration following a pa­
rade here.
Justice .Hughes' resignation was re*
ceived at the White House with strict
formality. The negro messenger who
brought it to Secretary Tumulty was
told to wait. Mr. Tumulty took up a
position behind his desk and then
the message was ushered in. "From
Mr:".Hughes?" the negro, said. "Thank
yoii, very Thhch," replied the sect'e
tary. 'He Ihert hurried to the presi­
dent's office, and the president called
for a stenographer, and in five min­
utes the acceptance of the resigna­
tion was on- its way to the Hughes
home.
No Successor in Mind.
President Wilson has not begun
considering a successor to Justice
Hughes of the supreme bench.
The supreme court recesses Mon­
day and it was thought likely he
would not hurry in making a choice.
Justice Hughes' successor will be
the third member of the court named
by President. Wilson. The resign^
tion today leaves five republicans and
three democrats on the coyrt.
Justice Hughes was assigned to the

Chicago, June 10.—Tho republican National convention today
nominated Charles Evans ITughes \Tew York,and Charles Fair-,
banks, of Indiana for their choice as the" president and vice .presi­
dent of the United States- Almost, at the same moment, Theodora
Roosevelt was nominated by the progressives' convention an.i John
M. Parker of Louisiana was named a* his running mate.
The republican nomination required a ballot, the third of th«
convention, while the progressive nomination was made by accla«
motion.
Mr. Roosevelt's provisional declination to accept the progres­
sive nomination is believed by politicians to leave the door open
for eventual withdrawal of the third ticket, in event Mr. Hughes'
position on what the progressives feel the vital issues of the cam­
paign meet, with their approval. To this extent, the leaders o{
lotli parties feel that the efforts at harmony may yet,, be utilized.
.Justice Hughes filed his resignation as member, of the supreme
bench before his acceptance of the republican nomination.

had dispatched the message of ac­
ceptance, and called the waiting
group of newspaper men into his
study to tell them of his decision.
Accepts Resignation.
President Wilson accepted the re­
signation in a reply almost as ibrief.
Apparently, the rtsignation was fram­
ed so that the president might be sav­
ed the embarrassment of expressing
regrets or making more than a for­
mal reply.
"I hereby resign the office of asso
icate justice of the supreme court of
the United States," he wrote. To
which the president replied:
'I am in receipt of your letter of
resignation, and feel constrained to
yield to your desire. I therefore ac­
cept your resignation as justice of the
supreme court of the United States
to talre effect at once."
No Plans 'Made.
No plans have been made by the
hominee for the summer. In his tele­
gram of acceptance Mr. Hughes an­
nounced his stand "for the firm and
unflinching maintenance of all the
rights of American citizens on land
and sea," for an Americanism that
knows no ulterior purpose, for a pa­
triotism that is single and complete
for the "preparedness, not only entire­
ly adequate for our defense with re­
spect to numbers in equipment for
both army and navy, but with all thor­
oughness, to the end that in each
branch of the service there may be
the utmost efficiency under the most
competent administrative head."
