The trial of the disbarment pro

preme court for decision as to lh"ilner litigation between the same par-', (ien Jacinto Trevinn, commanding
tjiiilt or innocence of the two attor
neys on the chatK's filed anainst
1hem and also :is to the punishment
that (hall be isiled upon them in Ihe
event they ure found to be KUill.V.
It iH believed tjiat the iteclsion in
the case will be forthcominn with the
minimum of delay, as there was com
paratively little conflict In the evi
dence Introduced as to the physical
laet" of what Is allcd to have trans-
piled, the main contentions leinn as
to the legal eflecf of those facts and
the construction to tie placed on the
ads of the two attorneys. Motives
play a larne part in Ihe determination
of the case, and it will be for the three
.ItitlKes who sat al the trial to decide
from Ihe evidence what motives act
uated Mr. Marion and Mr. Wood in
certain of their actions under review.
Ilefore leaving for their homes last
iiit;lu the members of the court held
an informal conference al which it is
heliewd that a Kd'eral nnderstandiiiK
was reached as lo what decision would
be nu.de on certain of the accusations
which were heard at the trial. What
the result of this conference was could
not be learned, as each member of the
court was silent as to what took place.
n certain points involving disputed !
issues of fact there will be no attempt
u hp tin 11 f iin
to arrive n a conclusion until theevi
denee has been transcribed by Ihe
stenographer and the Judges have had
an opportunity carefully to consider
the record as made up.
ilkcison Contradicted.
The feature of the morning session
yesterday was the flat contradict ion 1
hv Mr. Matron of certain sensational
siutetin iit.s made Friday afternoon by
Thomas N. Wilkerson and the reading
of depositions made by Mr. Wllker
non's former client, to whom the tes
timony given the ufl,ernoon before re
lated, also negativing the tesiinu.ny
of the alicrney. Mr. Wilkerson pre
viously had taken Ihe stand and testi
fied that he had read these deposi
tions, hut was none the less positive
of the correctness of his assertions,
which he reiterated. The testimony
contradicted related to Ihe alleged
employment of coercive methods by
Air. Marron to compel Ihe defen.lanl
in a divorce proceeding1 to pay the
firm of Marion & Wood an exorbitant
lee.
No oral evidence was introduced al
Ibis hearing on the .barges glowing
out of the case of (Iareia vs. C.arcia,
which recently Were considerod In dis
barment proceedings in the I'nited
Siat.-s district court in Santa I'e, ex
cept as 10 one point, hut the record ol
thai hearing and the opinion of Judge
Pope finding Ihe respondents guilty
and suspending tlum from practice
for two years, was submitted In evi
dence. XewsHMr Publication.
The one exception referred to was
the charge alleging lhat Mr. Matron
procured the publication of a mislead
ing newspaper .story in the Albuquer
que Kvening Herald which tended lo
create, a false impression and did cre
ate a false Impression relative to Ihe
effect of a supplemental order issued
by Judge Pope ill the 1 iareia case, the
Mory in question stating that Judge
Pope's order' was a complete exonera
tion of the firm of Matron & Wood
front anv ehari;es of misconduct In
t he original case.
As on the hearing before Jude Pope
In Santa Fe, the witnesses on this
point were 'H. H. llening, editor of Ihe
evening Herald, and Mr. Marron. The
evidence of each was practically the.
same as that given at the hearing in
the federal court. Mr. llening told of
having .submitted the proof of the
story to Mr. Marron before its publi
cation and of having asked the latter
if It was correct, and of Mr. Matron's
having stated that it was. Mr. Mar
Tons evidence was to the effect that
be paid little attention to anything in
ihe story except the copy of Judge
Pope's opinion, and barely glanced
over the "lead," in which it was slat
ed lhat the firm of Marion A- Wood
had been exonerated. The evidence of
'nth witnesses was lhat Mr. Matron
did nothing to procure the publication
of the story and that he requested, if
anything was fmhlished at all. that
'he opinion should be set out in full.
