LASITE IN TUCSON
The many Tombstone friends of Miss
Leona Tracey were no doubt sur
prised at the receipt of the news that
she had been happily married Thurs
day afternoon to Mr. Wm. T Mere
dith. I
The announcement came as a sur-1
prise, as the bride had not confided
to even her closest friends that she
was about to become a bride, and '
when she left Tombstone Thursday 1
morning stating she was going to the
?oast to spend a vacation, not the 1
slightest suspicion on the part of her
friends was felt.
Miss Tracey Is the accomplished
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Tracey
of Tombstone, and has been a teacher
for the past several years, having
graduated at Tempe normal She was
one of the efficient teachers in the lo
cal schools for two terms, afterward
going to Douglas. There she met Mr
Meredith and after a romance lasting
almost two years, became his bride
Thursday.
Mr Meredith Is a promising young
business man of Douglas. The couple
proceeded on to the coast where they
will spend their honeymoon, and will
return after a tour of southern Cali
fornia. They will no doubt make
'heir home at Douglas.

the agricultural possibilities of his
section. "Some of the folks who dis

New York. The question as to the
total iillitiiuit of A:ni-ric-..u and foreign
investments in Mexico has been much
discussed in Wall street since the sit

cal stage. Lstliiiatei run from $1,0X1,
mjO.OOO to ?l,5O0.tX.tHXI, and most
bunking houses with Mexican connec
tions are agreed that the lower figure
wss altogether too conservative.
For many years, in fact since the
Mexican war, American capital has
poured Into northern Mexico because
of the enormous mineral resources of
the states of Sonora, Chihuahua,
Coahulla and Nuevo Leon.
Many millions alw have gone Into
the sections around Tampico, where
the great oil wells are situated, and

rubber plantations of Tamplche and

SHOOTS ASSAILANT WHO ES

BY BLOOD: NOT FOUND
GLOBE, July 21. Fired upon by a
skulker in a patch of underbrush
south of Winkelman, Deputy Sheriff
Hamilton shot and wounded an un
known man who made his eucape.
The affray occurred Monday afternoon
and was reported to the sheriff yesterday-According
to the meager details
given out concerning the affair, some
women had become alarmed at he
actions of a man who was apparently
waiting for some one by the roadside.
short distance from the town. De
puty Hamilton was notified and
promptly proceeded to he place to
Investigate
Walking opposite a clump of mes
qulles, which had been described as
the hiding place of the supposed high
wayman, the officer saw a saddled
horse but no sign of the owner. Ham
ilton stopped and called out, "Hello,
what are you doing there?"
From his resting place under a
bush, a man Jumped up, fired point
blank at Hamilton and leaped for his
horse. As he did so the deputy Jerked
out his revolver and fired back, the
bullet striking the man as he was In
midair. However, the fugitive man
aged o land in he saddle and dashed
away with his arms hanging around
the neck of the madly galloping steed.
The officer hurried back to town,
secured a horse and a posse which
searched without result for the mur
derous prowler that night and the fol
lowing morning. Blood stains were
found where the rider mounted the
enimal and drops were found at inter
vals for a quarter of a mile. Here the
trail ended and all efforts to pick :t
up proved In vain.
IE GETS
OTHER FIRE SCARE IN
IT
Tombstone received another fire
scare today when flames broke out
in the rear of the Machomlcb Mercan
tile store, where boxes and packing
material had been piled. It is not
known Just how the fire was started
but evidently resulted from a cigar
or cigarette. The fire alarm was
given, and before the hose could be
gotten into action, Douglas Gray had
gotten the flames under control with
the fire hose from the Machomich
building. It was at first thought the
fire was located in the store muildlng
and considerable alarm was felt for
a short time. The flames gained con
siderable headway, however, before
put under control and had It not
been for the Machomich building ap
paratus being brought into play, seri
ous results w-ould have no doubt been
the outcome.
