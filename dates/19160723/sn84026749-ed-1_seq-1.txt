BALTIMORE, July U.-After a few
moves during the night which led
watchera to believe the Deutschland
would start out, the tug Tlmmona shift
ed back to a position alongside the sub
marine 'at 8 o'clock this morning, and
locked up the barge cordon around the
subsea liner.
Those aboard the .Deutschland and of
ficials of the Eastern Forwarding Com
pany are still secretive about the sailing
time of the U-boat.
It seemed likely today, however, that
tho undersea freighter might be oft on
her homeward Journey before tomororw
night.
Officials of the Eastern Forwarding
Company will know In a few hours
whether negotiations for a large con
signment of gold to be sent back to Ger

obtained the little merchantman will
leave her pier, at the foot of Andre
street, to mako room for her sister ship,
the Bremen, now said to be approaching
the American shore.
Reliable authorities connected with
the submarine's agents in Baltimore
ddnled this morning a rumor that tho
Deutschland's clearance papers have
been filed In the custom house. It
was said that only Captain Koenlg,
the submarines commander, couia
file her clearance papers and Captain
Koenlg did not go to the custom
house yesterday.
It was stated further by good au
thority that Captain Keonlg would
make no secret of his departure as
far as the customs house authorities
are concerned feeling certain he will
have no difficulty in clearing the boat
at the proper time.

Despite the many rumors as to the
cause of the delay In the aubmarlne'a

that the pending negotiations for a

Woman suffrage leaders of tho Con

of the submersible secretly conferred

allied patrol off the capes, and traced
me expected route or ooin tne uremen

Some expect the Bremen to arrive
In tsn or twelve hours.
Naval men said one meihod of
"fooling" the patrol would be to have
the Deutschland reach the capes and
then submerge, while the Bremen ap
peared and headed Inward. Such a
move would make It appear that the

There were some prospects of labor

they were disgruntled over the mat

SAY HEADACHE CURE
KILLED DR. ADAMS
Police Adopt Theory in Boston
Love Triangle When Victim's
Diary Is Found.
BOSTON, Mass., July 23. A diary
kept by Dr. Cella Adams has furnish
ed police with a new series of clues
witn which they hope to solve the
mystery of the woman osteopath's
aeatn and the shooting by her fin
ance, Dr. Eldrldge Atwood. of the man
who, Atwood charges, betrayed the
girl Dr. Wllfrod E. Harris.
The last entry In the diary was re
garded as specially significant by the
police. It read:
"Met Elle at the South station at
7:30 Sunday night. We went to South
Revere Beach and sat a long time op
the sand. Discussed the matter fur
ther." Police believe "Elle" Is an abbrevi
ation of Dr. Atwood'a first namo and
are striving to discover what the
"matter" was they discussed, bellev
InB it essential to a solution of the
triangular mystery.
Talk of Headache Powder.
Indication was found In the diary,
the police say, that Dr. Adams' death
was not by suicide, and the theory
has been advanced that she was
poisoned by a merlcurlal preparation
substituted for harmless headarhn
powders.
wnen aicaical Examiner George B.
Magrath and chemists made an exami
nation of Dr. Adams' office at Coolldgo
Corner and determined It was nome
form of mercury that caused her death,
they found a box of headache powders.
Reasoning that her professional ex
perience would cause her to avoid a
painful death bv mercury If she In
tended to commit suicide, the authori
ties regarded tho headache powders as
a clue.
Statements made by members of tho
family of Dr. Adams that thcro was no
truth In the story of Dr. Atwood that
she had been deceived by Dr. Harris,
U'pia fnprihnrntAi1 hr lip TTnrrfa ,Vi
Is stAl In a dangerous condition.
Calls Atwood "Little Fool."
Dr. Harris first spoke of the shooting
to his brother-in-law, Dr. II. W. Co
nant. "Hurrv. why did the llttlo fool (Dr.
Atwood) do It?" Dr. Harris asked.
Dr. Conant, hesitating to tell Atwood's
paHcnt. replied that he could see no
reason unless It was Jealousy.
Well." said Dr. HarrlB. "what In the
namo of all that's good could ho bo
Jealous or me for7"
White tho entry in Dr. Adams' dlhry
might be taken as corroboration of At
wood's story that she had recently told
him of her relations with Ur. Harris,
there wiib found a memorandum in a
waste basket in Dr. Adams' otnee,
Which sccmod to have been written re
cently. It read: "Ask Dr. Harris wnat
treatment was In this case,"
It Is argued that this shows that the
woman had no Intention ot Killlns nor
self, as she planned later to nsk Dr.
Harris, who sent her many patients, re-
liuruwg some case.

Torreon and Durango City.
Capture Sure He Says.
Caught between two (Ires, Villa's
death or capture will be Inevitable, ac
cording to General Trevlno, who adds:

report of Gen. Matlas Ramos. In which
Ramos stated that, having attacked
Villa' nt the El Florida ranch, striking
the-bandits on the rear and both flanks,
he dislodged the bandits In an all-day
fight, driving them south to the Ban
Isldro ranch, where he again attacked
and pursued the bandits more than
fifty miles Into the state of Durango,
where he finally lost contact with them
owing to the Inferiority of his horses.
Ramos reported that more than 200 of
Villa's command were killed and seven
wagon loads of supplies captured.
The engagement occurred between
July 15 and 17, and was accompanied by
some losses of de facto troop, the pre
cise number not stated, according to the

Ramos stated It was evidently the
Jurpose of Villa to attempt to form a

At the time the message was sent

Investigators View Collier Lost
Off Charleston to Find Cause
of Trouble.
CHARLESTON, S. C, July 3.
Mcmbers of the naval board of Inquiry,
Investigating the loss ot the colUer
Hector off Charleston In the recent
storm are visiting the sceno of the
wreck today.
While tho wrecked ship Is In such a
condition as to preclude any Idea of
substantial salvage, CaPt. W. R. Shoe
maker, prealdent of the. Investigating
commission, hopes to learn Important
facts In connection with the causes of
the ship's loss by the Inspection.
It developed at the hearing that dur
ing the terrific storm the hatches of
the collier lost tholr battens and the
vessel shipped 2.000 tons of water, which,
pouring lnte her hold, nearly cnpslied
her.
Although one witness said he doubted
If even now hatches could have with
stood the strain, the condition of tho
old hatch battens is considered an im
portant point.
According to testimony bofore the
board of inquiry the Hector, without
radio warning of the approaching
storm, lost her bearings and. tn send-
i Ing calls for help, gave Incorrect loca
tions.
Captain Ncwall, commander of the
ship, finally gave up hope of saving the
Hector, and bent all his energies to
running her Into shoal water to save
the lives of thoso aboard.
Most of the testimony nt'the hearing,
which opened Thursday, has been given
by Captain Newall,
Chief Engineer Coffey, of the Hector,
and Captain Wyman, of tho Paducah,
aUo testified.
No charges of neglect of duty havo
been preferred against either officers
