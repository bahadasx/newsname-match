LONDON". July 22. The greatest ar
tillery battle of the European War is
now raging along the British and
French front. Flanders is being dev
astated by the steady fire poured In by
the British, French and German artill
cr. according to the official state
ment of the British and French com
manders. The battle is one of give and take
with guns, and at many points hand-to-hand
encounters are taking place.
Military experts have two explana
tions for the sudden activity of the
infantry:
First, that the Allies are preparing
for another offensive which will be
greater than the present one and if
successful may prove the end of the
war, and
Second, that the Germans, pushed to
desperate measures, are seeking by
the terrific artillery fire to find a
weak spot in the Allied line to relieve
the terrible strain of the present of

LONDON. July 22. For the first
time since the Allies started their
great offensive, the Germans arc los
ing the tremendous advantages in
the way of fortifications afforded
them by nature.
In the woods of Foreaux and Dei
lille the Germans have been swept
from the last vestige of natural cov
ering. The great' natural fortifications
held by them up to last minute have
been captured by the British, and
now it is understood why the Ger
mans held on to the defenses with
such tenacity. With the Teutons out
of these fortifications an easy Hritish
advance is predicted.
What little woods the Germans still
have in their possession is being
steadily riddled by a tornado of ar
tillery fire from the llritish.
Dispatches from the front say that
the Hritish, when they came to the
third line, found that the Germans
had burrowed underground and that
the whole district contained a great
series of tunnels covered with steel
roofs, only the heaviest kind of fire
being able to penetrate them.

BROWNS TOMOBERLY
"Bobby" Hogg Will Play
With Red Sox Locals !

This morning the Columbia Browns

Wlll HIUIII W1U HUUrtO. ....... . J .
ncv to Moberly. where they will this
afternoon invade the camp of the Mo-
berly Red Sox baseball team. The)
.Moberlv nine remembers the severe!
defeat it received at the hands of the
Browns on June 18, the last game the
two teams have played.
Both teams have made additions to.
and changes in. their line-ups in or
der to make a stronger battle for vic
tory in the clash today. One addition
to the Moberly team that is interesting
to the fans here is that of "Bobby
Hogg, a star on this year's Tiger team
.i ,w,i romnitli n member of the
Hannibal club in the Threc-I League.
"Bobby" will perform today on tne
initial sack for Moberly. Moberly ex
pects the hitting and field work of
the former Tiger star to enhance its
chances to cop the flag in the league
race this year.
Another valuable addition to Mo
berly is Ted Shaw, who played with
the Paris team until that club dropped
out of the Central Missouri League.
Shaw will be in the outfield. Neff,
who is considered by the fans as a
top notcher among the twirlers in the
Central circuit, will serve the fast
ones for Moberly tomorrow. Neff de
feated the Higbcc Blues last Sunday
in a ten-inning contest, 2-1.
But Manager Taylor hasn't had his
eyes shut in the matter of "fixing"
the Browns for Moberly today. The
Browns' tutor has just returned from
a scouting trip north, and he has
something up his sleeve which will
surprise the fans here. The newest
addition to the Browns' line-up is
Winegar, an amateur leaguer whom
Taylor has brought here from Hanni
bal. Winegar will catch his first game
for the Browns today at Moberly.
Manager Taylor says that Winegar is
not only a good catcher but a good
hitter.
Taylor made it known yesterday
afternoon that Threlkeld and Dewey,
the star battery of the Paris team.
will join the Browns within a couple
of weeks. Taylor says that Mexico
and Moberly arc also bidding for
these men, but that he has the option
on the two. He says that Threlkeld
will be played in the outfield and that
Dewev will work behind the bat.
Threlkeld led the league last year in
the number of safe swats, but the
formidable Browns outfielder, Gustav
Dippold, will deprive him of that
honor this year.
The line-up of the Browns for the
game today will be as follows: Ligon,
ss; Foster, 2b; Winegar, c; Dippold,
rf; Taylor, cf; Butledge, If; Mason,
lb; Caldwell, p; Davis, 3b; Vogt, Lan
sing and Duff, substitutes.

Board of Directors Meets
Many Horsemen Reserve
Stalls Here.
It. L. Hill, secretary of the Boone
County Fair, read correspondence
concerning every department at a
meeting of the Boone County Fair
directors yesterday. He said he was
getting twenty letters a day asking
about the concessions, so the midway
would probably be more interesting,
even than it has been in the past.
The $1,000 mule-eolt show is also a
drawing card he says. The directors
decided to visit the Moberly and
Brookfield fairs to try to get the
horsemen to come to Columbia. Men
have been at work on the track for
the last few days.
All school children under 14 years
old will be admitted free on Wednes
day. The admission tickets can be
obtained from George T. Porter, coun
ty school superintendent.
Among the well-known horsemen
who have already reserved stalls are
John T. Hook, who will have charge
of the stables of Miss Loula Long of
Kansas City, Jumps Caut horn of Mexi

SAILING PAPERS FILED
FOR GERMAN U-BOAT
Deutschland Ready to Leave,
but Waits for Bremen,
Is Report.
Naval Fight in Sight of Balti
more Has Now Become
a Possibility.
liy I'nlteil Press.
BALTIMORE, July 22. Five min
utes before the doors of the customs
house were closed, Captain Hinsch of
the Eastern Forwarding Company filed
the clearance papers of the super
submarine Deutschland. The filing of
clearance papers is the application of a
vessel for permission to sail.
The possibility of a naval battle at
the doers of the United States is real
ized by military experts here. The
sister ship of the Deutschland, the
Bremen, is nearing American soil, con
voyed by two of Germany's biggest
fighting submarines. A naval expert
here today toid the United Press that
Germany, with these two fighters, may
make an attempt to torpedo the Allied
cordon outside of the United States
three-mile line. The two German
fighters will undoubtedly convoy the
Deutschland on her return trip and
should they run into the Allied war
ships a battle would not be merely a
possibility but a certainty.
Captain Hinsch, as usual, is quiet in
regard to the Deutschland.
JOHN LANGE IS DEAD
Negro, a Former Columbian,
Was Business Manager for
Blind Boone.
John Lange, a negro, for thirty-five
years business manager for Blind
Boone, Columbia's well-known negro
musician, died Friday at his home in
Kansas City.
I-ange was one of Columbia's pio
neers. He was born October 4, 1S40,
at Harrisburg, Ky. His father was a
Creole. During the Civil War Lange
worked with his father as a butcher.
He was the second oldest of sixteen
boys and girls.
At the close of the war he moved
with his parents to Columbia. Here,
much to his disappointment, he found
no educational facilities for negroes.
Of an industrious turn of mind, he
then tried to find some way of helping
his father educate the family. A small
s-'hool was started. The Baptist and
the Methodist churches for negroes
were established. He then set out to
aid his father in establishing a better
school. Cumming's Academy was the
result, taught by the brother-in-law of
lunge's father.
I.ange himself had practically no
education. He was a self-made man.
During his early life in Columbia
he was a contractor and built nearly
every road made while he was here.
The last part of his life was lived in
Kansas City but he always called Co
lumbia his home and looked upon the
Baptist Church of Columbia as his
church. He was responsible for the
building of this church.
Lange married Miss Ruth Helen
Jones of Glasgow on December 26,
1S73.
Born to slavery, he came out from
under its influence with a determina
tion to be a success. As he accumu
lated wealth he did not forget others
and was noted for his charity and
liberality. His success as manager
of Blind Boone is well known.
Funeral services were held today at
the home in Kansas City.

U, S, NOTJICTATING
Wilson Informs Mexico He
Is Anxious to Settle the
Whole Discussion.
WASHINGTON, July 22. President
Wilson desires a far-reaching discus
sion that will once and for all settle
the difficulties between the United
States and Mexico.
It became positively known today
that the President does not want the
scope of the discussion limited to the
recent military border trouble that
he says, can be settled by the military
leaders but he wants a complete
settlement of the difficulties.
It is known that the President is de
termined to prevent Carranza or the
Mexican public from thinking that the
United States is in any way trying to
dictate to her southern neighbor.
General Carranza has been informed
of the United States' desires, and this
country is now awaiting word from
him.
The President is expected to make
known his acceptance of the commis
sion plan for settling the difficulties
today.
The commission may be asked to in
clude all events since the Madcro
regime.

a Panic When a Suitcase
Dropped on Walk Blows
Up Dynamiters Escape.
FLAGPOLE IS DRIVEN
THROUGH MAN'S LEG
Two Thousand Persons Are
Thrown Into Disorder by
Tragedy Many Windows
Shattered Reserves Called.
I'.y I'nlteil Press.
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., July 22.
Four persons were killed outright,
two died from injuries and forty
others were wounded when an infernal
machine was exploded in the crowd
viewing the great preparedness pa
rade in which 50,000 persons marched
this afternoon. The two thousand
persons at the scene of the explosion
were thrown into a panic, and the
procession was completely broken up
at that point. A suitcase in which
bomba had been placed was thrown
on the sidewalk. The dynamiters es
caped. Several San Francisco newspapers
had received letters threatening "di
rect action" against the preparedness
parade. They were not taken serious
ly, being regarded as written by some
crank against preparedness.
The police have a suspected per
son under arrest. He is said to have
addressed several persons after the
explosion, and in referring to the dead
list said: "Is that all that were
killed?" The identity of the arrested
man was withheld.
The explosion came as a tragic
climax to the greatest patriotic dem
oiiFiration in San Francisco's history.
About 2 o'clock, half an hour after
the head of the parade had passed
the corner of Stewart and Market
streets, the deafening explosion shat
tered windows for several blocks
around and threw the spectators and
marchers into a panic.
The bomb in the suitcase had gone
off in the thickest part of the Market
street crowd. Scores were knocked
down and injured. Persons on the
sidewalk were heaped in a screaming,
yelling mass. The foot of one child
was torn completely off. A marcher,
(jrrying a big American flag, found
.he standard blown from his hands
and the flagpole driven through his
leg.
The wildest confusion prevailed.
The policemen turned in hurry calls
for reserves and ambulances, and
made a hard effort to check the panic
and restore order.
