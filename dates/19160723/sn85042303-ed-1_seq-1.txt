GERMANSGENTER STRDNGATTACK
ON ALLIES IN UDSGES REGION
HAVE SHIFTED THEIR STRONGEST ATTACK TO VOSGES
REGION, SAYS PARIS REPORT, BUT WERE REPULSED
THERE.
On
the Verdun Front, Germans Have Resumed Their Heavy
Bombardment of French Positions Near Fleury and Fumin
Wood In the Re "m of Moulin, Soustovent, a strong Ger
man Attack was .. rsed Germans Pouring Gas Shells
and Projectiles Com -g Eye Irritants into British First
Line Trenches in Nor. 'v France, According to Reports
Reaching London Flooc "'ong the Dniester Proving of
Great Value to the Teuto. 'v they Make Progress by
Slavs Impossible and Release - "re Number of German
Troops for Uses on Other Front I Pressed by the Russians.
The Germans have tempo
rarily shifted their strongest at
tack on the western front to the
Vosges region, where in the re
gion of St. Die they were re
pulsed by the French, Paris re
ports. On the Verdun front, the
Germans have resumed their
heavy bombardment of the
French positions near Fleury
and Fumin wood.
In the region of Moulin,
Soustovent, a strefhg German
reconnaissance was dispersed
A sprited artillery duel is in
progress along the British front
in northern France, During
which the British first line and
supporting trenches are bom
barded with gas shells and pro
jectiles containing eye irritants,
recorded in today's London re
port. Along the Dniester river, the sum
mer floods are proving of great value
to the Germans. These Hoods cause the
river to rise quickly to a height of
six or seven feet, covering wide ex
panses of territory and making mili
tary operations impossible and pre
venting the Russians from, crossing.
This relieves thousands of German
troops there for use on other fronts,
which are hard pressed by the Slav
armies. A further retirement of Von
Linsingen's army is admitted by both
Berlin and Vienna.
BE PLENTIFUL
ALL THE COUNTY CANDIDATES
WILL HAVE A SEAT ON THE
PLATFORM, AND ARDMORE
VOTERS MAY SIZE THEM UP.
Next Tuesday night on the court
house lawn the county and state can
didates will have an opportunity of
telling the people of Ardmore who
heretofore have been denied the priv
ilege just why they want the partic
ular office to which they aspire, and
also tell why their rival is not so well
equipped, mentally, morally, or physic
ally for the office as they. Of course,
the voters of the city have heard all
this 6tuff before, but the old jokes al
ways get the laugh and so it is in poli
tics, the old tales get the votes maybe,
but then the candidates will feel all
the better for having gotten it out of
their system, and the citizens will al
so be relieved when they learn that
there is at least one honest man run
ning for every office within the gift
of the people of the county and dis
trict When the master of ceremonies has
called time and the conversation gets
under way, there will be no limit to
the amount of words each candidate

past is himself a candidate this year,

eagerly forward to this event as they
will have an opportunity of addressing
the largest audience assembled during

Information given out by the
French authorities in regard to the
situation at Salouiki seems to indi
cate that the entente allies are pre
paring an offensive movement. A
Salonikl dispatcli of several weeks
ago said that an allied offensive in
Macedonia had been arranged for the
middle of May, but that it had been
postponed and might be expected in
July at the latest. There are some
130,t)00 Servian troops on this front,
several hundred thousand French and
British soldiers. It is generally un
derstood the allies have 000,000 or
more men available for a campaign.
Opposed to them are the Bulgarians,
with unknown numbers of Turks,
Germans and Austrlans. It has been
reported that Bulgaria's allies have
withdrawn troops recently. The up
per of the two accompanying pictures
shows Servian, French and English
soldiers fraternizing in Saloniki and
rejoicing over a bit of news favorable
to the allied cause. The lower pic
ture shows a high Servian officer
(right) in earnest conversation with
the British General Milne.
who writes the best letter to The
Ardmoicite. The details of the judging
will be made out later and submitted
to the pupils and competent judges
of English, etc. will be selected from
the teachers of the county to award
the medal. We are not go!n- to say
that it will be a very expensive gift,
but it will last always, and will be
suitable for such a gift and will he
worth earning. It will be awarded at
the close of the term next spring.
