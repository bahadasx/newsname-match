^ Police .Hake Arrest.
W The police arrested i-rana juneimson,
a lodger in a sailor's boarding
house, who cried "I did not do it; I
didn't do it" and trembled violently
when he was being searched at the
station house. The police said he had
not been accused of anything- Charles
M. Fickert, district attorney, issued a
statement attributing the deed to a
mind unbalanced by arguments, and
against preparedness. The parade
was not interrutped. The explosion
occurred at Steuart and Market
streets, two blocks from the Ferry
building on San Francisco's main
thoroughfare. The bomb, concealed
in a suitcase packed with cartridges,
bullets, gas pipe, glass and scrap Iron
blew a gap through the crowd, blasting
men. women, children and babies.
The one-story brick building against
which the suitcase stood was wrecked.
The holiday throng cheering a contingent
of veterans of the First California
infantry of the Spanish-American
war became a shambles. The
blare of fifty bands and the roar of
drums drowned the cries of the injured
but the sidewalk was strewn
with torn bodies.
"Two women standing beside me
were blown to bits," said Mrs. Kingsley
Van Loom, of Oakland, who with
her two children was Injured. The
police say it Is possible that some
bodies were blown out of existence.
