FRESH OUTBURST

One Victim Dies Every Forty
Minutes-135 New Cases
Are Reported.
(By the International News Service.)
New York, July 22.-One baby died of in
fantile paralysis in New York City every
forty minutes today.
Another infant was stricken with the
deaily disease every ten minutes.
With 39 deaths and 135 new cases, the
epidemic once more assumed plague pro
portions. With the arrival in the city
tomorrow of Dr. Simon Flezner it is
probable that more stringent prophylac
tic measures will be announced by the
health authorities.
Dr. Flexner will cor.fer with Dr. Alvah
H. Doty, custodian of the $.50,000 Rocke
feller Foundation fund. He will probably
meet Health Commissioner Dr. Haven
Emerson also.
Both Dr. Flexner and Dr. Doty have
been assured of financial support up to
any amount by the Rockefeller Founda
tion. John D. Rockefeller himself is
greatly interested in the campaign and is
said to have asked Dr. Flexner to spur
the Rockefeller Institute bacteriologists
on in their efforts to evolve a specific for
poliomyelitis.
Although officials were not ready to
make announcement, they said privately
today that it is exceedingly unlikely that
the public schools will be permitted to
open as scheduled on September 11.
Today's figures brought the total num
ber of deaths to 555 and the total of cases
to 2.744. These do not jibe with daily
totals given out by the health depart
ment, but searchings of the records to
day proved them to be correct. Despite
the increase today there were 144 less
cases reported for the week ended July 2
than for that ended July 15. The figu"es
read 789 and 933.

SISTER HEARS
REBEL PLEA
Mrs. Newman Watches Sen
ate Discuss Intercession
for Casement.
Mrs. Agnew Newman, sister of Sir
Roger Casement, the Irish political lead
er condemned to death for treason, sat
in the gallery yesterday while the Sen
ate fought over a resolution that would
have the President intercede with the
British diplomats in behalf of her brother.
The Senate Committee on Foreign Af
fairs showed no disposition to take ac
tion on the resolution so Senator Mar
tine, father of the bill, moved for the
committee's discharge and action by the
Senate.
Senators Stone and Williams were
among those who felt that the English
would resent the resolution as interfer
ence with their courts. Senator Phelan
said there was abundant precedent for
such legislation and Senator Nelson pre
dicted that the Casement sentence soon
would be commuted to life imprisonment.
At the conclusion of the spirited de
'bate it was found that the measure was
so involved in parlimentary red tape that
action was postponed until Monday when
Senator Martine expects to renew his
light.

M'CORMICK MAY
QUIT AS HEAD OF
WILSON'S FIGHT
Southern Congressmen and
Pennsylvania Democracy
Oppose Campaign
Leader.
By ANDEW R/KELLEY.
Rumors have become more and more
persistent that Vance McCormick.
chairman of the Democratic National
Committee and. as such, director of the
Wilson campaign, may shortly resign his
position.
Southern members of Congress place
the blame on the Democratic chairman
for the determination of President Wil-;
son to have child labor legislation adopt
ed during the present session-a measure
they strongly oppose.
The President's visit to the Senate this
week was after conference with Chair
man McCormick, and his insistence on a
child labor bill is considered a direct ap
peal for Progressive votes.
In addition to the opposition of South
em members, the Democratic chairman
faces an opposition from members of the
committee who feel that some member
of their organization should lead the
fight. A considerable faction of the
Pennsylvania Democracy oppose McCor
mick to the point where they openly con-'
demn any and all of his policies.
McCormick may be said to enjoy the
full confidence of the President, but
those who are quietly criticizing him say
that Homer Cummings. Democratic Na
tional Committeeman from Connecticut.
should be placed in charge of the cam
paign. Cummings now is in charge of
the speakers' bureau
Because of his wealth and his ability
to reach men in the financial and busi
ness world who will contribute to the
Democratic war chest. Chairman Mc
Cormick makes a desirable leader and;
the same rumors that indicate his prob-!
able resignation from the chairmanship;
would have him continue with the com
mittee in charge of the work of raising
campaign funds.
Yesterday the Democratic leader visited
the Capitol and talked with Senators
and Congressmen over the coming elec
tion. He talked at length with Senator
Kern. and Vice President Marshall over
iS Indisaa outlook and also was in
telephonic communication with the Presi

Ready to Act as Mediator
Between Railroads and Dis

Definite assurances that the railroads
will accept mediation to settle the big
strike threatened between the operating
companies and all men in the freight
transportation service. have been re
ceived by the United States Board of
Mediation and Conciliation. it was learned
at the board's offices here yesterday.
Judgce W. L. Chambers, head of the
board, has written a letter to President
Wilson telling the Chief Executive that
in Chambers' opinion the difficulties be
tween the roads and the men will be har
monized and that there will be no strike.
The President now is fuly informed on
the issue.,and may be expected to take a
hand in the negotiations himself. if need
appear.
Information In the hands of the board
is to the effect that the labor unions are
prepared to make further concessions in
order to prevent a break. Already, it was
stated, they have receded considerably
from their first demands.
Even though not invited to intervene
by either party, the board will proffer its
good offices before any actual walk-out
can occur.
