ture of General llalg's forces of the
whole of Foreaux and Dclvllle woods,
tbe German forces In tbis particular
sector will be ewei out of the last
vestige of natural cover. This ex
plains the tenacity with which tbe
Germans have cluug to these ' two
spots now being steadily reduced by a
tornado of Britluh artillery fire to
a blackened area of stumps snd holes
In the ground. '
But If tho Germans are being forc

the British forces are now encounter
ing the full strength of tho third
line positions of the enemy the
trenches, bomb-proofs and shelters
which the Germans have had plenty
of time to perfect, uninterrupted by
artillery fire.
Despatches today said ' British
trench stormenf found the enemy In
many cases burrowed underground
in labyrinths where roofs were rein
forced by steel plates and concrete.
Only tbe heaviest of artillery fire has
any effect on such defensive struct

Military experts here today pointed
out that the German counter attacks
