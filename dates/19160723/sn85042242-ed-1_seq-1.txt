Quick Work of Officers Round

DOUBLE REWARD FOR
FOUR OF THE MEN
Neavels and McOee Are Thought
to Have Planned the Whole
Affair.
Quick work on the part of the
officers in pursuit of the escapes
at the penitentiary brought about
the recapture of three, Andrew
8chmidt, Alley Pyles and Adolph
Tornberg, near Apple Creek, be­
fore midnight.
The usual reward.of $50 for re­
capture of escaped prisoners has
been doubled for four of the men
still at large. They are:, W. H.
Neavels, up for burglary from
8tark county Mack McGee, a
lifer J. J. King, who escaped
once before, and .James Gleason.
Neavels and Mi&ee are believ­
ed to have planned the escape,
the former using his Inside infor­
mation to good advantage.
encumber
dtafe* to not having'money enough to
hire more, made possible thp escape
of eJght prisoners from the state pen­
itentiary Saturday forenoon between
10:30 and 11:20.
Saturday is bath day at the peni­
tentiary, which makes necessary the
talking.of the inside yard guard and
placing him in charge of the bathers.
Thif old Icehouse hides from view a
portion of the east wall from the
guards in the towers on the north
and south walls.
Bury All Debris.
Using a piece of shafting, a ma­
son's bar and a heavy crowbar, the
prisoners broke a hole through the
east wall. Tracks show that lookouts
were placed at each end of the ice­
house to watch for the intruders. As
the bricks were remov'd tliey were
thrown into the icehouse and covered
up with earth. All debris was buried
so as to leave no traces of the work.
The place was carefully selected,
demonstrating a clear knowledge of
conditions of the wall. On both sides
are heavy pillars of brick, Ave feet
thick. The place selected is the weak­
est spot in the wall. Inside the wall
there is nothing to show where the
wall is thick and where thin.
Working oh 'Diamond.
Two of the men who escaped had
been detailed to place the baseball
diamond, adjoining the icehouse, in
condition. It is believed that these
men are the oneB who broke through
the .frail.
the twine machinery was running
at full speed during the morning, the
noise of the machinery drowning the
noise made by the prisoners in bat­
tering a bole through the wall.
Neavels Brains of Gang.
W. H. Neavels was the brains of
the conspiracy. He was formerly on
the police force at Beach, this state.
From there he came to the peniten­
tiary, as a guard and was employed
for six months. He was discharged
for becoming too intimate with the
convicts. Shortly after leaving the
penitentiary he formed a band of rob­
bers and entered on a career of crime
robbing box cars. He was sentenced
for third, degree burglary from Stark
county, In March, 1916, for a term of
live years.
James Gleason, another of the es­
caped prisoners, has a long prison
record behind him, including terms in
Sing .Sing and other state prisons.
He was sentenced from Mount­
rail county in 1915, for 15 years, for
second degree murder.
King Escaped Before.
J. J. King was the convict who
escaped on June 12, while work­
ing in the brickyard. He was
recaptured and returned from Aber­
deen, S. D., last week. In his previ­
ous escape he was picked up by a ma­
chine almost under the eaves of the
penitentiary.
Pyles and Tornberg were employed
In the boiler room and while wheeling
out ashes saw the hole in the wall
and took advantage of the chance to
escape. Schmidt was yard orderly,
having charge of sweeping the walks
ai|d cleaning up, and probably was on
watch while the other men cut the
hole In the wall. McGee, Rudolph
ptnd King escaped after leaving the

Severe Storm
Experienced
In Bismarck
A severe electrical storm was
experienced in the Capital C]ty
last evening, but up to press time
this morning, no serious damage
was reported from any section of
Burleigh county.
Hall accompanied the heavy
rains in Bismarck and vicinity
but, according to Weather Observ­
er Roberts, it was not noticeable
in any other portion of the Slope
country.
Generally fair is the prediction
for today.

Perfect Day's Tour.
A perfect day's touring over roads
declared by Secretary Hahly to be
"85 per cent effiicent" brought the
first of the Red Trail sociability tour
cars into Bismarck at 6 o'clock last
evening. The jaunt from Fargo to
Bismarck, which registered 216 miles
on the speedometer, was covered in
the record time of eight and one-half
hours, the party beating the storm in­
to Bismarck by a narrow margin.
Brooks, in the Chalmers Pathfinder,
led the nearest car by about fifteen
miles, coming into the Capital City.
Brooks will be remembered as the
driver of one of the Pathfinder Chal­
mers which went over the trail last
spring. He has lost no speed since
that time. Entry No. 2, an Oldsmo
bile, carrying Mr. and Mrs. Bohn E.
Fawkes of Minneapolis, finished first
after the pathfinder. President W.
W. Smith and Secretary Hardy of the
Red Trail association, in a Chalmers
master six, came in third. Entry No.

H. M. Erenfeld, Doris and Fred Eren

made a whirlwind finish in tow of
President Oris W. Roberts of the Bur­
leigh County Automobile club, whose
Overland big six refused to get out
of the way. The last car in arrived
before 8 o'clock, and the day's run
was generally declared one of the
most successful, if the most strenu­
ous, of the tour to date.

Editors Are Warned.
All of the newspaper ofilces in San
Francisco received a communication
written in Roman script with an in­
delible pencil, many of the words be­
ing heavily underscored. The com­
munication was signed, "The Deter­
mined Exiles from Milistaristic Gov­
ernment." "Italy, Germany, United
States, Italy, Russia, Russia."
In several instances the writer re­
peated himself.
Peculiarly Worded Commuif cation.
The communication reads:
"Editors: Our protest has been in
vain in regard to this preparedness
propaganda, so we are going to use
a little direct action on the twenty
second, which will echo around the
earths, and show that 'Britsol really
knows how and that militarism can­
not be forced on us and our children
without a violent protest.
"Things are going to happen to
show that we will go to any extreme,
the same as the controlling class, to
preserve what little democracy we
he have. Don't take this as a joke,
or you will be rudely awakened.
Awaken (sic) we have sworn to do
our duty to the Masses and only send
warning to those who are wise, but
who are forced to march to hold their
jobs, as we want to get only the rypo
critical (why) patriots who fchot for

"kindly asked the Chamber of Com­
merce to march in a solid body if they
want to prove they are no cowards.
A copy has been sent to all the pa­
pers. Our duty has been done so
far."
Every possible precaution, police
officials said tonight, was taken, but
the innocent looking -suitcase stand­
ing where a friendly country visitor,
of whom there were thousands, might
have set it down, attracted no atten­
tion.

It was a different scene from that
when the companies left to mobilise.
Then there was every indication ot
an immediate bloody conflict with the
southern republic. Peace prospects
made yesterday's departure 'sseM
more like an enthusiastic send-off to
a booster train.
Officers Skeptical.
The militiamen showed clearly that
the long-awaited orders to move
brought joy to their hearts. Some Of
the officers who served in the Span
ish-American war inwardly smiled at
the attitude of the troops. It will
a different story, they said, after
few months in the tropics.
Only one sad happening marred the
leave-taking, the sudden death of Mrs.
Alice Nelson Page of Grand Forks,
mother of Sergeant Dike Page of th*
machine gun company of that city.
Her death is believed to have hewt
caused by the shock of her son's im«
mediate departure.
Head of Print Shop.
Mrs. Page was the proprietor of
the Page Printery.
The immediate cause of her death
was hemorrhage of the brain.
Sergeant Page received word Fit*:

and left for Fargo. When be arrived
there he received a wire that she was
all right and started hack to campM
but had not gone far before he wa»
handed a message from Col. Friths,
telling of his mother's desth and or
