(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO, July 22. At least six persons
were killed and forty-four more were injured by an ex
plosion here today of a timed bomb in the micfct of a
throng viewing a preparedness parade. The police ar
rested Frank Josephson, a lodger in a sailors' boarding
house, who cried, "I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" and
trembled violently when he was being searched at the
station house. The police said he had not been accused
of anything.
Charles M. Fickert, district attorney, issued a state
ment attributing the deed to a mind unbalanced by ar
guments for and against preparedness which have been
occupying attention here. The parade was not inter
rupted

EL. PASO, Tex., July 22. Obviously
Buffering great mental distress, Harry
J. Spannell, who recently shot and
killed his wife and Lieut. -Col. M. C.
Kutler In Alpine, Texas, spent the
night in a cell in the local county jail
in which General Victoriano Huerta
was confined a year ago. He was
guarded by deputy sheriffs from Brews
ter county and two Texas rangers.
Every attempt was made to keep se
cret the news of the prisoner's presence
and the Brewster county authorities
refused to allow anyone to communi
cate with Spannell. They said that he
did not desire to discuss his case and
added that he had retained no attor
ney. Nor would the officers talk ofi
the ehooting. Much feeling has arisen
In Alpine, especially because of the
death of Mrs. Spannell, who had been
revered in Alpine, knew most of the
townspeople and who was one of the
most popular young women in West
Texas, they said.
Spannell has two days' growth of
heard on his face, which Is drawn and
haggard, and his hands and fingers
twitch constantly, officers said tonight.
It Is believed probable he will be held
here until Tuesday night, when he
will be taken to Alpine for a prelim
inary examination.
Three deputies who arrived with the
prisoner early today asserted feeling
in Alpine Is tense and authorities there
felt an attempt at violence might be
made. On the way to the jail the
party was intercepted by a newspaper
man who asked Spannell why he killed
his wife and Butler.
Apparently on the verge of collapse
Spannell replied:
"Don't bother me. I have nothing
to cay."
According- to reports from Jail au
thorities only once did Spannell show
any emotion, when he awoke from a
fitful sleep, burst out weeping and ex
pressed a wish to see his 5-ycar-old
daughter.

PLAN FDR PEfiCE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON', July 22. Acting
Secretary Polk held his fifth conference
today with Eliseo Arredondo, General
Carranzas ambassador-designate, in an
effort to arrive at an agreement re
garding the proposed negotiations for
settlement of matters in dispute be
tween the two governments.
The fact that no announcement fol
lowed today's meeting was construed
to mean that a satisfactory reply had
not been received from Mexico City
to the Washington government's com
munication on the proposed commission
plan suggested by General Carranza.
It has not been disclosed whether a
serious disagreement has arisen al
though both conferees said progress
was being made, indicating their be
lief that any misunderstanding that
may have arisen as to the scope of
the proposed negotiations might be
cleared away by further exchange of
views.
It was intimated today that contin.
ued delay in arriving at an agreement
as to the form and scope of the nego
tiations has served to render some of
ficials less hopeful of the ultimate re
sult of the conferences between Mr.
Polk and Mr. Arredondo. It is now
practically certain that no agreement
is to be expected before the middle of
next week.
It was stated semi-officially today
that the operations of bandits in the
Parral region, said to be headed by
Villa himself, in no way affected the
diplomatic discussions with the de
facto government.

COLUMBUS. N. M., July 22. An
American known as Guy Johnson,
who for several months, has been a

mand, was arrested upon his arrival

of the army intelligence bureau. It

Hartman, formerly connected with
a liquor concern in Kansas City, Mo.,

dollars, but subsequently dissapeared.
It was said here tonight that he had
been traced to one of the American

the department of justice.
Army officials said that Johnson's
services as scout have been very
valuable. Recently, however, he was
taken ill and ordered tc Columbus

in which he was riding and started
across the desert, but was overtaken

MEXICAN PAPER SAYS
U. S. TROOPS WITHDRA WN
(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Tex., July 22. A two-column story, purporting to be a dis
patch from El Paso announcing the withdrayal from Mexican soil of the
American expeditionary forces, was printed July 19 in El Democrata of Chi
huahua City, copies of which reached here today. The story said that the
action was taken up on orders of "General Baker," American secretary of
war, and added that he had announced that the guardsmen sent to the bor
der will now be sent to their respective states. It also asserts that General
Pershing himself requested that "the Yankee forces be withdrawn." With
drawal of the troops was ordered, it was stated, "because the causes which
brought on the Mexican crisis no longer exists."
The same paper contains a detailed account of the recent attack upon
a Carranza supply train between Palomas and Santa Ysabel, west of Chi
huahua. It announced that five Carrancistas were killed and five wounded.
A passenger was killed and a Villista prisoner-and a woman wounded, while
the Villistas lost eight killed and seven wounded, it was said.
Train service from Torreon to the border is again becoming normal. A
train which left Torreon Wednesday arrived at Juarez early today.
The passengers asserted that conditions in that section were quiet at
the time of their departure. They added that the green corn crop has been
the savior of the people. There is still a lack of proper foods, but the new
corn prevented actual famine, which was threatening the central and northern
states, particularly the district around Torreon.

LONDON, July 23.The entente al
lied offensive, which swings between
the western and eastern fronts with
' almost clock-like regularity and in a
manner almost completely to prevent
the central powers from making any
considerable transfers of troops from
front to front now is centered on the
Russian front. The forces under Gen
eral Sakharoff have taken the of
fensive energetically and their victory
in the salient formed by the junction
of the Lipa and Siyr rivers, south
west of Lutsk, today appears to be
much more important than either the
official claims from Petrograd or the
Austro-German admissions of yester
day indicated.
General Sakharoff has the enemy re
treating in disorderly flight before his
forces. Having forced the passages of
the Styr and Lipa the Russian troops
already are beyond Berestechk, hav
ing in two days' fighting taken pris
oner from the Austro-Germans 3'i0
officers and 12,000 men. In addition
the Russians have captured a quantity
of war booty. The number of Austro
Germans captured in the operations
on the eastern front since July 16 now
total 26,000.
By his success in driving the Austro
Germans from the Styr-Lipa salient.
General Sakharoff has established his
forces firmly on the right bank of the
Lipa up to about 20 kilometers (about
12 miles) above its confluence with the
Styr.
General Kuropatkin is still pressing
forward against the lorces of 1- leld
Marshal von Hindenburg on the Dvina
front, south of Riga and north of
Smorgen. According to military critics
in Petrograd a battle is in preparation
in the neighborhood of Koval, the ob
jective of the Russian drive across
the Stokhod, which will prove one of
the most important conflicts of the
whole war.
No striking news was received from
the western front today except reports
of heavy artillery action by both sides.
The British press gives great prom
inence to statements published in the.
French press and credited to General
Joffres and Sir Douglas Haig, the
British commander. The former is re
ported as saying that the entente al
lies now have the whip hand over the
central powers, while General Haig
says the supreme decision of the war
must be made on the western front.
