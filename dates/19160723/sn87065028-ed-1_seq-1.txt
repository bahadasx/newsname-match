RAIN HOLDS HACK
COUPLE IN AUTO
Mr. and Mr. Pottle, of Lot
Angeles, Detained by Swol
len Streams.
While rain has fallen at sporadic
intervals here during the past two
days the "showert have not been
" either violent or of long continued
duration, and fairly satisfactory
progress has been made in repairing
the damage brought to local high
ways by preceeding downpours.
It is not yet possible to accurately
estimate the exact amount of this
damage, but it will undoubedly
reach a goodly sum. Hon. T. J.
Locke, Jr., a member of the public
tjhway commission of district No.
2, which includes Columbus, stated
Friday that between . twenty and
thirty car loads of gravel would be
required to repair the damage in
this district, and as the gravel used
comes from Tishomingo county the
freight charges will necessarily have
to be added to the cost of the ma
terial. About $50 per day is being
paid out for labor in the second dis
trict, and highway commissioners in
some districts throughout the county
are also expending large sums for
both labor and materials.
The worst damage to highways in
this section was on the Pickensville
and Tuscaloosa roads. Large stretch
es of both highways were completely
washed away, and for several days
they weie r?:Srslv TJ . have

" SHIPS PlSSStS' THE SENATE
FOUR DREADNAUGHTS AND
FOUR CRUISERS TO BE
BUILT NOW.
Washington, July 22. The naval
appropriation bill, with a three-year
building program, including the im
mediate construction of four dread
noughts, four great battle cruisers
and 58 other craft passed the Senate
by a vote of 71 to 8. It carried $315,
826,843, or $45,857,588 more than
the total as the measure passed the
House.
Many proposals to curtail the
enormous building increase written
into ine measure Dy me senate navai
committee were defeated over
whelmingly and as soon as final
. i it. r.
passage was announceu ine sen
ate voted to insist upon its amend
ments and send the bill at once
. to conference. The House is ex
pected' to insist upon its building
program, and a long struggle is in
prospect beiore an agreement is
1 reached.
Two Democrats, Senator Thomas
and Vardaman, and six Republicans,
Senators Clapp, Curtis, Gronna and
La Follette, Norris and . Works, voted
against the bill, which has had the
support of both parties during the
. week of debate that preceeded pas
sage. A seven-hour speech by Senator
La Follette against the measure and
a clash between Senators Reed and
Oliver over the proposal to print as
a public document the Bethlehem
Steel Company's arguments against
a government armor plant delayed
, the final vote. The Bethlehem's ar-
. guments were ordered printed by
unanimous consent during Senator
Reed's absence from the Senate
chamber. On his return he vainly
sought reconsideration, charging
that Senator Oliver, as an owner of
steel stock, had voted money into his
own pocket by supporting the pro-
' posal. '
Senators Tillman, Swanson and
- Lodge were appointed conferees on
.the bill. The House conferees will
be chosen Tuesday and daily sessions
will probably be held thereafter by
the conference committee.

AMENDMENTS TO MEXL

BE CONSIDERED.
ULTIMATE I'EACE
IS END IN VIEW
Acting Secretary Polk and
Carranza Ambassador Hold
Another Conference.
Washinrrton, July 22. Official
announcement of the course to be
followed in seeking a peaceful solu
tion of thep roblema arising from
conditions along the Mexican border
probably will be made either to
morrow or early next week.
It appeared certain tonight that
the Washington government was
prepared to accept the commission
plan suggested by Gen. Carranza in
his note of July 11, made public yes
terday in Mexico City, but there are
indications that President Wilson
would prefer a more far-reaching
discussion than this communication.
Acting Secretary Polk conferred
again today with Eliseo Arredondo,
Gen. Carranita's ambussador, but
the conferees had no announcement
to make. Apparently acceptance of
the commission plan is awaiting
Gen. Carranza's reply to amend
ments proposed by the Washington
government to his suggestion, the
nature of which has not bt en reveal
ed. Mr. Polk is keeping both President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing, both
absent on vacation, advised of each
step taken. The acting secretary is
guarding closely what proposals are
being debated in his conferences
with Mr.. Arredonde He , again met
all inouirers today with Jho , state
ment,, that
mg
favorably.
The note of July 11th, as publish
ed in Mexico City, would limit the
proposed commission to riscussion of
three specific points: Withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico; ar
rangement of a reciprocal agree
ment under which ; the troops of
either government might cross the
border in pursuit of bandits; and in
vestigation of the bandit raids on
American towns to determine what
interests prompted them in an effort
to force intervention..
BATTLE OF THE SOU
BERLIN CLAIMS FRENCH USE
200,000 MEN IN FRUITLESS
ATTACK AT HARDECOURT.
London, July 22. The intensity
of the British and French attacks
against the German front north and
south of the Somme river, in North
ern France, appears to have lessened
greatly, according to the latest of
ficial statements. London declares a
lull has set in on the British front,
and the Paris official" statement of
Friday night mentions no . activity
along the whole front from north of
the Somme to Switzerland. In the
salient of the Leipsic redoubt the
Germans entered the lines held by
Gen. Haig's forces, but were ejected
subsequently, London asserts.
The Anglo-French attacks on the
German lines north and south of the
Somme on Thursday were fruitless,
according to Berlin, except on a two
mile front south of Hardecourt,
where the Germans retired from
first to second line trenches about a
hundred kilometers in the rear. The

The Columbus lodge of Elku have
ovcrything in readiness for the lec
ture which Mr. Harris Dickson is to
jrive at Lake Park Tuesday night,
the entire proceeds of which will go
to swell the fund of $10,000 which
the Elks of the state are trying to
raise for the benefit of the Missis
sippi volunteers who have been call
ed to the colors and who will be in
camp several months. Mr. Dickson
has offered to give ten lectures in
'.he state for the benefit of the sol
dier boys, and in order that they
may have necessities and delicacies
whieh the government does not pro
vide. The entertainment will open with
a solo by Mrs. T. B. Hardy, whose
.sweet voire always charms and cap
tivates. Rev. W. S. Slack will then
introduce the celebrated author and
lecturer.
Harris Dickson, creator of the
mirth-provoking negro character,
'Old Reliable," is the one man in
America today best qualified to
portray the characteristics of the
unknowable southern negro. During
a vareigated experience Mr. Dickson
has had rare opportunity to observe
and study him.
By means of anecdotes and illus
trations, strung upon a consecutive
thread of common sense, he conveys
a definite and kindly idea of rela-
Itiunships in the south between the
white man and the black.

FLAG HE SENT TO JACKSON
SAYS SOLDIERS WILL TAKE IT
WITH THEM WHEREVER
THEY MAY CO.
Mr. J. G. Weatherly, s ecretary
manager of the Columbus Chamber
of Commerce, recently wrote a let
ter to Lieut. John Lawley, of the Co
lumbus Riflemen, who ii now with
the state troops at the mobilization
camp near Jackson, asking what dis
position should be made of the flag
purchased for the Riflemen by pa
triotic Columbians. Although the
flag was officially presented to the
Riflemen before they left they did
not take it with them, and Mr.
Weatherly, knowing that the com
pany had been partly disintregaied
and a new captain who is not a local
man placed in command, did not
know exactly what to with the flag.
In replying to the letter Lieut.
Lawley states that, while under the
federal regulations officers and men
alike were transferred from one
command to another regardless of
friendship's bonds, and that while
Company I, as the local command is
now known, experienced more than
its share of the changes the men ara
rapidly developing into a disciplin
ary unit which promises to be one
of the most proficient companies in
the First Regiment. He requests Mr.
Weatherly to send the flag to Jack
son, and states that the local boys
will take it wherever they go, bring
ing it back to Columbus when they
return. The letter follows:
