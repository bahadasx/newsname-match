1 Warning Received by Newspapers
Fails to Prevent Explosion.
Several Dead. 44 Injured.
!
j SAN FRANCISCO. July 22.?At least
four persons were killed and forty-four
! or more were injured by the explosion
here today of a time bomb in tVe midst
of a throng viewing a preparedness parade.
The police arrested Frank Josephson.
a lodger in a sailors' boarding house, who
cried. "I didn't do it; I didn't do it." and
trembled violently when he was being
searched at the station house. The police
said he had not been accused of anything.
Charles M. Fickert. district attorney,
issued a statement attributing the deed
to a mind unbalanced by arguments for
and against preparedness.
Tne parade was not interrupted.
The explosion occurred at Steuart and
Market streets, two blocks from the ferry
building, on Pan Francisco's main thor,
oughfare. The bomb, concealed in a
suit case packed with cartridges, bullets,
gas pipe, glass and scrap iron, blew a
gap through the crowd, blasting men.
women, children and babies.
Tne one-story brick building against
which the suit case stood was wrecked.
Strewn With Torn Bodies.
The holiday throng, cheering a contingent
of veterans of the 1st California
Infantry of the Spanish-American war,
became a shambles. The blare of fifty
bands and the roar of drums drowned
the cries of the injured, but the sidewalk
was strewn with torn bodies.
"Two women standing beside me were
blown to bits." said Mrs. Kinsley Van
Loom of Oakland, who. with her two
children, was injured. The police say
it is possible that some bodies were blown
out of existence.
All of the newspaper offices in San
Francisco yesterday received a communication.
written in Roman script with an
iiiuruiiK' (wikii, ui<*ji> vi iiic wuiua i?ring
heavily underscored.
The communication was signed: "The
determined Exiles from Militaristic
Germany ? Italy. Germany, United
States. Italy. Russia."
Writer Repeats Himself.
In several instances the writer repeated
himself. The communication
read: "Editor: Our protests have been
in vain in regards to jjii.s prepared, propaganda.
so we are going to use a little
direct action on the 22d which will
echo around the earth and show that
Frisco really knows how and that militarism
cannot be forced on us and our
children without a violent proteat.
"Things are going to happen to show
that we will go to any extreme, the
same as the controlling class, to pursue
what little democracy we still
have. Don't take this as a joke or
you will be rudely awakened. Awakened.
(Sic). We have sworn to do our
duty to the masses and only send
^ warnings to those who are wise but
who are forced to march to hold their
jobs, as we want to give only the pyocriptical
(sic) patriots Who shout for
war but never go a real .taste of war.
"Kindly ask the chamber of commerce
to march in a solid body if they
want to prove they are no cowards.
A copy has been sent to all the papers.
Our duty has been done so far."
Every possible precaution, oolice offllcals
said tonight, had been taken,
but the innocent looking suit case.
standing where a country visitor of
whom there were thousands, might
have set it down, attracted no attention.
Force of Bomb Astonishing.
The force of the bomb was astonishing.
A piece of lead pipe was blown
two btocks into the Northwestern
Pacific railroad waiting room. A woman's
gold watch, presumably belonging
to one of the victims, was blown
through the air and landed in a fruit
atand a block and a half away.
Through this violence the parade
continued without a break. The
veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic,
waiting iri Steuart street to fall
Into line, escaped death by a hair, and
proceeded with the march. An ambulance.
summoned to care for a fainting
spectator, stood across Steuart
street when the explosion occurred.
One of the patient's legs was fractured,
and a man aiding the attendants fell
with a fractured skull, but the ambulance
steward was uninjured. He
packed both men and some other victims
into the ambulance and rushed
' them to a hospital.
The official count of the parade indi
cated that 51,319 persons were in line.

I BULL MOOSE FAIL
i TO INDORSE HUGHES
i Republican Nominee's Friends
Scorn Action After Row at
Syracuse Meeting.
RADICALS IN MINORITY,
BUT MAKE MOST NOISE
i Bainbridge Colby Leads in Opposition
to Roosevelt-Perkins Wing
of the Third Party.
BY ST. O. MESSENGER.
SYRACUSE, X. Y., July 22.?After
1 many hours of bitter wrangling, the
progressive state committee adjourned
sine die, without taking action upon
the proposed indorsement of Hughes or
' any other proposition.
The motion to adjourn was made by
W. H. Hotchkiss, floor leader for
Hughes. He said he had not talked
with Mr. Hughes, but knew his feelings.
The antis were delighted with the
outcome, while the Hughes men claim
it will not affect the vote of progressives
in support of the ticket.
The indorsement was sought at the
hands of the progressive state committee,
which is composed of 150 members.
Of this number only fifty-eight were
present, the rest, excepting eigiit, being
represented by proxies. Upon the call
of the roll the very first name was protested,
and thereafter more than twothirds
of the proxies were^Rrotested.
The meeting became a monkey and
parrot affair from the jump. The radicals
had been working up to it all day,
as they gathered in the lobby, denouncing
George W. Perkins and his lieutenants
in the most violent way for having
surrendered to the oid party.
Conservatives Favor Hughes.
As the meeting progressed it was evident
from analysis of the personnel of
the participants that the indorsement
of Hughes was favored by men who are
recognized as conservative business
men and leaders in their communities,
and that most violent protestants were
men who had been conspicuous heretofore
as radicals. Some of them were
I former democrats.
Bainbridge Colby was once a/epubj
lican. but, a? he said, when he' joined
I the progressives he joined a new party
and cannot now be classed as a republican.
The point is that the op!
position to the plan for reunion of
I Col. Roosevelt. Mr. Perkins and the
national organizations
I with the" extreme radicals, including
.former democrats. This realization is
important and accounts for the confident
"statements republicans in the
bull moose party h>.ve returned to the
| old party, leaving only the irreconcilai
bles and former democrats outside the
j breastworks, who, it has been per!
sistently claimed, are comparatively
I not numerically powerful.
| Bain bridge Colby, in reply to a ques|
tion by The Star correspondent, said
j that he was not prepared to announce
: that he would vote for Wilson in event
1 of indorsement by the committee of
Hughes.
i Hugo Wintner of New York city, who
| was the progressive candidate for the
| supreme court justice in 1915. declared
j he would support Wilson if Hughes
i were indorsed.
Favors Another Convention.
Mr. Colby Is heartily in favor of
Parker's call for another bull moose
convention. He said Parker has been
encouraged in the idea and that a
conference will be held this week
either in Washington or New York to
determine whether a convention shall
be called.
Lawyers among- the Hughes men declare
that no cause for action under
the electiqn law will lie in the matter
of choosing electors for Fairbanks
while Parker is still a candidate for
Vice President, the radicals threatening
an injunction to prevent naming
Fairbanks electors.
Colby declared to The Star correspondent
that irrespective of the action
f the committee on the proposed in!
dorsement of the gubernatorial candidacy
of Judge Seabury, prospective
candidate for governor on the democratic
ticket, a great many progrctssives
will support Seabury at the polls if
nominated in preference to Whitman,
whatever th"v may do on the presidency.
This bears out The Star's recent
dispatches from New York, which
pointed out that Judge Seabury is very
popular in many quarters.
Lcse Fight on Proxies.
The progressives opposed to indorsement
of Hughes fought every inch of
j the ground, making their4 first stand on
j the proxies of committeemen. After a
1 lot of wrangling and bad feeling, when
i | a dozen men would be on the floor all
1 j speaking at once and exchanging bitter
j personalities, the contests were finally
j referred to a committee on credentials,
i which, after wrangling for two hours,
! brought in a report which was adopted,
j Then the fun commenced. Judge WillsArn
L. Ransom of New York city ofI

"cordially commending him to the favor|

' voters of the state." It was greeted with
! applause, hut the aritis "booed" and
hissed vociferously.
J. J. O'Connell offered a substitute
' leaving to the judgment of the voters
' the question of voting for electors. .Judge
liansom raised a point of order against
the substitute as not being germane.
Colby tried to change the issue to bring
up the selection of vice presidential
electors, which resulted in a quibble over
, parliamentary procedure. The point of
'order was sustained, an appeal taken
' from the decision with cries of "steam
i roller methods" from the anti-Hughes
t ! forces.
The anti-Hughes faction included
; ! ha If a dozen young men who broke
.'loose from control of Colby and O'Connell
and for ten minutes raised a reg.
uiar riot. By this time it was quite
apparent that the radicals were in a
minority, but they made up in disorder
( . what they lacked in numbers.
t The meeting was in such a parliaimentary
tangle and some of the com..mitteemen
were "^oo red hot that fist
? fights seemed imminent, and O'Connell
"i asked to withdraw his substitute, but
the redhotters objected to that also.
No attention whatever was paid to
I parliamentary law and the man with
the loudest voice held the stage. When
. they didn't like the ruling of the chair
they demanded that he yield the gavel,
while the most obstreperous when
called to order, invjtcd any one jpl#si!

HOOSIER POET, DIES
Famous Writer of Verse Succumbs
to Stroke of Paralysis
in Indianapolis.
SANG OF JOY AND SORROW
WITH INSPIRED REALISM
His Homely Symbols Based on
Quaint Observations of Life
Brought Him Fortune.
INDIANAPOLIS. July 22.?James Whitcomb
Ftiley died tonight at 10:50 o'clock
while only Mr. Riley's nurse was awake
in the poet's home. He had asked for
a drink of water and reclined on his
bed again. Miss Clementia Prough, the
nurse, resumed her vigil, and. noticing
that the poet seemed not to be resting
easily, approached his bed. Mr. Ril?y
died before she reached his side.
Mr. Riley's death was due to paralysis.
He suffered a violent stroke about
7:30 o'clock^ this morning, and the
members of his household were greatly
alarmed, but under Dr. Carleton B. McCulloch's
ministrations the poet seemed
to improve, and early this evening
was regarded as much better.
Information was given to the public
that Mr. Riley was in no danger, but
within a few hours he was dead. Members
of Mr. Riley's family were summoned
immediately. They are his
brother-in-law, Henry Eitel; his
I nephew. Edmund H. Eitel, and his
niece. Miss Elizabeth Eitel. Mr. Riley
suffered his first violent attack of paralysis
July 10, 1910.
Mr. Riley, born of the middle west,
sang the joys, sorrows, fancies and hu
dialect. The world was so touched by
his inspiration and the realism of his
homely symbols that he was one of the
few that, devoting their lives to poetry,
gained a fortune.
Story of Poet's Career.
Mr. Riley was born at Greenfield. Ind.,
in 1S53, and spent his earty life among
the rural surroundings of this little
country town. It was here that he accumulated
that vast store ot/ experience
so much drawn upon in later life |
for the writings that have gained him j
literary fame the world over. In fact, j
many of his poems are experiences of |
his days of childhood.
If we are to believe one of Mr. Riley's !
interviewers, his poetic genius early j
manifested itself. The poet is quoted
as saying: "My first poems were the
j outcome of what seemed a dire necessity
to my childish mind. You see. most
of the other children in the little town
where my family .lived were in. the
"habit of sending valentines back and
forth. Well. Valentine's day was coming.
and all of the boys and girls, but
me, were busy getting their valentines
ready to send. My own brothers and
sisters were busy like the rest, but I
was so little that no pennies were
! triven me to buv valentines with. I
wanted to send them all fhe same, so I
grot pencil and paper and drew pictures
as much like those on the bought
valentines as I could. After I had colored
the rude drawings to life, as I
imagined. I supplied the rhymes at the
bottom 'out of my own head." There
wasn't much poetry in those baby compositions.
1 imagine, but such as it was,
was original."
IMdn't Want to Be Lawyer.
The poet's father, Reuben A. Riley, a
lawyer of some reputation in GreenJ
field and vicinity, was extremely
anxious that the poet should .emulate j
his example and take the law as a pro- j
fession. This parental desire struck no '
corresponding chord in the poet's
breast, and though it is not on record j
that father and son quarreled openly'
upon the subject it is certain that
young Riley's aspersion of his father's
profession was for a long time a matter
strictly tabooed in the Riley household.
Shortly after this episode the poet
became possessed of an ambition to become
a portrait painter, and finding no
better means at hand, vented his artistic
yearnings on the barns and fences
of the vicinity. He next joined a travel
ing troupe of actors, but as far as can
be learned failed to distinguish himself
other than considerably benefiting the
company by rewriting parts of their
productions that jibed with his
literary sense. His thespian experience,
however, was brought to a close in a
disbandrnent which took place in a city
at some distance from his home. Riley
here called his sign-painting ability
into play and literally blazed a trail of
signs to Greenfield.
Offered Editorial Position.
During the sign painting era of the
| poet's career he made friends in AnI
derson, Ina., and upon his arrival at
| Greenfield he found a letter asking him
j to accept the position of local editor
on the Democrat. Here he improved
j his time by2 writing reams of verses and
j trying them on the Andersonians, much
| to the disgust of his chief. Despite the
! fact that he was not setting the world
j afire with his verses he persevered,
j and in 1882 first burst upon the town
' of Indianapolis with an "original
poem," not by James Whitcomb Kiley,
j the country editor, but by "Benj. F.
i Johnson, an edjucated man," who had,
\ "from childhood up tel old enuf to
! vote, alius wrote more or less poetry,
j as many an album in the neighbor;
hood can testify." This "original poem"
> was printed in the Indianapolis Jour
nai, along witn >ir. jonnson s letter,
, and was highly complimented upon its
, poetic qualities.
Contributes Verses.
This, it may be said, really marked the
| beginning of Riley's poetic career. He
j continued his contributions to the jour|
nal, and in 14*83 an Indianapolis publisher
issued "The Ole Swimmin-Hole
! and 'Leven Other Poems, by Benjamin
; F. Johnson of Boone." The work ex|
cited widespread interest, and the
identity of the writer soon became
; known. He was Induced to come to Indianapolis
and accept a position with
I the Journal, and for several years coni
tributed to that lucky sheer a dally
! garland of verses.
) From this time on Mr. Riley's repuj
tation increased with the passing years,
till at the time of his death he was considj
ered America's foremost poet. He was
as versatile as he was prolific, and his
literary efforts have extended into the
field of prose and drama as well as
poetry.
The following- honors were conferred
upon Mr. Riley: A. M., Yale, 1902; Litt.
V., University of Pennsylvania, 1904,
and L/Lj. D., Indiana University, 1907.

Sister Submersible Enters the p
Chesapeake Bay. *
NORFOLK. Va.. July 21.?From thfe d
] same source that two weeks ago tdI
night predicted the arrival of the giant
merchant submarine Deutschland within
a few hours, today came the declaim
ration that her sister ship, the Bremen,
will enter Cape Henry before Mon- P
, re
day. )(
While not supported by any official a
authority, the declaration aroused the
greatest interest here because of the ^
informant's correct forecast of the a
coming of the Deutschland. The news 'r
m?ir?iriv snread alone: the coast and
tonight many vessels are working I
toward Cape Henry to he present In I
case the Bremen does arrive within ?
the next few hours.
Along the beaches many eyes are
straining for a sight of the second submersible.
Rain is falling, however, and
the skies have been overcast all day,
so it is doubtful if more than a few
fortunate enough to pick up the Brem- S
en with their searchlights in case of
her arrival by night will see her. ?
May Not Stop at Capes.
Should the Bremen arrive she is expected
to obtain a Maryland pilot and
proceed at once to Baltimore. The
picking up of a Virginia pilot by the
Deutschland was not according to plans P:
made before her arrival and delayed P
her docking at Baltimore somewhat. w
German sources here say this will not Sl
happen with the Bremen. ir
Despite announcement from Balti- d;
more that the Deutschland did not secure
clearance papers at the customs t<
house there today, reports here were g
that the submersible had cleared for o]
Germany, ar.d these caused credence to n>
be given to the report that the Bremen tl
may arrive soon. Marine men here pi
pointed out that announcement of the 1V
clearance of the Deutschland may have tj
been withheld at Baltimore in the in- ^
terest of neutrality.
There Is a constantly growing; be- ^
lief here that the Bremen will pass into
the capes at about the time of the de- V1
parture of the Deutschland. Sugges- c<
I tion has been made that it is part of r,
j the German plan to have the two submersibles
in the capes at the same *
! time so as to confuss the allied wari
ships now lying about eight miles out P'
i in the Atlantic. It is pointed out that "
' the Bremen might slip into the threemile
limit without the knowledge of
the allied crews and take a position in
full view of them while the Deutschland
passed out under water. si

One of the allied warships, presum- tc
ably British, fired a shot across the bow a,
of an unidentified vessel about ten ^
miles off the capes today, it was reported
tonight. Virginia Beach resi- "
dents who said they witnessed the incident
brought the story to Norfolk.
According to them, the vessel, which f1
was supposed to be a trader, halted "]

Clearance Papers Not Issued.
BALTIMORE, July 22.?A visit of
apt. Frederick Hinsch, superintendent
f the German merchant submarine
>eutschland's pier, to the customhouse
lis forenoon gave rise to a report that
e had filed the submersible's clearance
apers. The record of today's business,
owever, contained no entry of the un- I
er-water craft having cleared, and
tter an employe of the customhouse
eclared that no application for clearnce
papers had been filed.
Capt. Hinsch himself, when asked
bout the matter, said:
"You ought to know that the captain
i the only one who can file clearance

of the Deutschland, did not

Official, in Reply to Criticisms From
XL S., Says Hostile Interests
Should Not Get British Aid.
LONDON. July 22. fi:1? p.m.?In
reply to a number of criticisms which :
the publication of a list of eighty
seven American individuals and firms j
with which English firms are forbidden J
to do business under the tradire- with '
the enemy act has met with in.'a
America and here. Laming Worthing-ij*
ton Evans, chief of the department of j ^
foreign trade of the foreign offgee, j p
made the following statement to the j
Associated Press today:
I o
The statutory list has been com-jt?
pilfd from one point of view only, jti
namely, to prohibit British citizens'^
from supporting firms which are \ tSj
strengthening our enemies. The test ! M
applied before putting a firm domi- w
ciled in America on the statutory list
is this: Is that firm by its business s<
operations strengthening our enemies? el
If so, then British firms may not sup- ai
port It.
"Outposts" Throughout World.
"It is one of the principal lessons of c<
the world war that the strength of a ir
belligerent does not consist only in tc
the resources and supplies available a
in its own territories, but also in those tl
upon which it can draw from neutral d<
countries. As a result of the semi- v;
military organization which the Ger- "iv
man government has imposed on its V
commerce every German firm through- n<
out the world is an outpost, seeking G
to do its utmost to assist Germany in
her effort to dominate Europe, and 11
the fact that they are established in 11
neutral countries in many cases makes j p<
them more formidable and their j gi
activities less easy to combat than j pi
would otherwise be the case. lo
"Can it then be said fairly that when 0'
the British government is fully aware
of these activities, it should do nothing | ai
to frustrate them? Can it be claimed G
fairly that, instead of endeavoring to u
frustrate them, they should be actually st
assisted by British firms. British cables, m

Necessary in Interests of Allies. jjj
"It is true that the trade ^lone by th
British firms with German firms in neu- I jjj
tral countries has attained very con- fc
siderable proportions, and to cut off n<
this trade by means of the statutory vv
blacklist meant a certain amount of inevitablc
loss. But the government con- (V
sidered that the loss to British trade
would be much less than the loss caused J'
to the enemy, and, besides that, the sacrifice
involved is necessary in the in- f.
terest of the allie?. ..
"It may be pointed out that long before
the British statutory blacklist was t
put in operation the French govern- ..
ment prohibited Its nationals from do- b
ing any business with any enemy subject.
It can hardly be contended that tl.
the statutory blacklist is more onerous p
to trade than the French system, which ar
long since was recognized by interna- \n
tional law. at

ver Europe to presage the death of milons.
The second anniversary of that
vent finds all the people of the great
lliance stamped with the conviction
lat their victory will be. as Gen. Botha
uts it. "complete and absolute."
To be inspired by so strong a hope is in
self a power. For the world's future
ie struggle, with all its horrors, will
ave been worth waging. Morally we feel
lready that we have the reward of our

We have no delusions. We have been

lie central league and secure a sound
econstruction of the old world.
Planned Slow, Sure Job.
The allies have begun this time by
eckoning with the worst that may

aid themselves out for slow, sure
vork. But they think that well before

vhich issued the deadliest message in

in instrument, but when that tool is

lerman ascendency, even in the eyes

iccept the consequences. The kaiser's
subjects themselves will cnange tne
system.
Chiefly we have three thoughts. We
ire glad, above all things, that we are

situation on the Mouse has reached exiremity.
and we hope with our alliei
:hat Verdun is saved. We believe thai
n common with the other allies wf
lave worked out a fighting method as
certain as fate and that the central
empires must* succumb to it. Finally,

Army Close to People.
We feel that it is coming to its own,
is we always knew it would, and we
Lre honorably content'with that. In a
omplete sense it is the army of the
lation?bone of our bone and flesh of
tur flesh. The navy is the senior servce
and all else depends upon 4t; but
or every household in the land which

loines which have men in khaki.
The fleet alone could never have done
nough. In a sense Trafalgar led to

n army ten years would not bring us
l the present war to as good a goal,
nd under the conditions of modern
ind war no one can afford a decade of
Besides, even Trafalgar might not
ave led to Waterloo had not the route
assed through Moscow and Leipzig.
Our democracy of today feels that by
?a we are not less great than were
ur ancestors, while by land our miliiry
achievement in two years Is relavely
and absolutely incomparably
reater than theirs. And that has
aved the day in Europe. But for that
le whole continent, from Paris to
[oscow, from Hamburg to Bagdad,
ould have been under the Prussian
eel. The enemy's area of supplies
ould have been immensely enlarged;
;a power alone would have been less
ffective against William II than
gainst Napoleon.
Met a Superior Enemy.
The first forces we threw onto the
jntinent baffled the German outflankig
sweep when the enemy was three

share, according to our numbers, in
le honors of the Marne. The British
sfense of Ypres when the German adantage
in guns seemed overwhelming
ax as heroic as the French defense of
erdun, and one cannot say more. Even
3W we cannot understand why the
ermans failed then to burst our thin
nes across the road to the sea. Had
le Germans known with what dcs?rate
difficulty we held for want of
uns and numbers the enemy would
-obably have been at Calais and Bougne
long before the first year was
,-er.
Some military experts of very high
Lithority indeed think that if the
ermans had made their chief effort in
10 west in the spring of last year, inead
of against the grand duke, they
ight have broken through and tinhod
with Russia afterward. This year
would unquestionably have been far
?tter for the enemy to throw his
imost weight on Russia. But again
le enemy did the contrary and made,

here. France was attacked this

erdun. But something else was hap ning.
Britain's new armies were
ade at last and had become equal?

ie world. In numbers and equipment
icy were becoming every day more i
iloutable. They had reserves certain I
outlast those of Germany. To inire
that remarkable situation was the

rench lines?a very important step
id the beginning of a still more

Still Inadequate in April.
But even in April our preparations

Jtered on the Russian front.
The forces under Gen. Sakharoff
have taken the offensive
energetically and their victory in
the salient formed by the junction
of the Lipa and Styr rivers,
southwest of Lutsk, today appears
to be much more important
than either the official claims
! from Petrograd or the AustroGerman
admissions of yesterday
; indicated.
Thousands Captured.
; Gen. Sakharoff has the ^nemy

fore his forces. Having forced
[ the passages of the Styr and
Lipa, the Russian troops already
are beyond Berestechk, having in
two days' fighting taken prisoner
from the Austro-Germans 300
officers and 12,000 men. In addi
jtion the Russians have captured a
quantity of war booty. The number
of Austro-Germans captured
in the operations on the eastern
front since July 19 now totals
26.000.
Fierce engagements have taken
place south of Riga, and Russian
troops have penetrated the German
first line at several points,
says the official statement issued
by the war office.
Established on Right Bank.
By his success in driving the AustroGermans
from the Styr-Lipa salient.
Gen. Sakharoff has established his
forces firmly on the right bank or the
Lipa up to about twenty kilometers
(about thirteen miles) above its confluence
with the Styr.
Meanwhile, Gen. Kuropatkin Is still
pressing forward against the forces of
Field Marshal von Hindenburg on the
Dvina front, south of Riga and north
of Smorgon. According to military
critics in Petrograd, a battle is in
preparation in the neighborhood of
Kovel, the objective of the Russian
drive across the Stokhod, which will
prove one of the most important conflicts
of the whole war.
Russian Official Report.
The Russian official statement says:
"On the left wing of the Riga position
attacks on the Germans continued.
Northeast of Smorgon, in the region of
the village of Martyschi, another fortunate
coup enabled us to capture a portion
of an enemy trench during the
night. Heavy German artillery violently
bombarded the sector east of
Baranovichi.
"South of the Lipa our troops are
still driving the enemy back. They
have passed Berestechk and' have advanced
farther to the west.
"Gen. Sakharoff Thursday and Friday
took prisoner 300 officers, including a
general and a colonel, and 12,000 men,
making the captures of Austro-German
troops in the operations since July 16
total 26,000. We also took a large quantity
of guns and material, yet unestimated.
Whole Regiment Surrenders.
"In the region of the villages of Werben
and Piliasohovo, on the right bank of the
Styr, south of its confluence with the
T.ir^a wft surrounded the 13th Austrian
Landwehr Regiment, which surrendered
in its entirety.
"In the region of Vorokhta on the road
from Delatyn to Maramoros Sziget, we
conquered the heights yesterday, taking
prisoners and three machine guns. West
of Yaremtschie, in the same direction, we
captured a company of Austrian troops
and machine guns.
Germans/ Claim Success.
The German official statement, reporting
operations on the eastern front, says:
"On both sides of Ekau B^ndenburg
