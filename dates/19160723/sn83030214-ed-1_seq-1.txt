STATE MOOSE
MEETING ENDS
IN we RIOT
Hughes Men Force Ad?
journment Before
Vote to Indorse.
POLICE CALLED
TO KEEP ORDER
Friends of Ex-Justice In
sist Result Was a Victory
for Their Nominee.
rPrnrn a P'ar? rrr-frapordfrt of Tha Trlbnna 1
Syraeuse. July 22. After one of the
most boisterous gatherings recorded in
New York political history, during
which the poliee were called in to pre?
serve order, the Progressive State Com
mittee adjourned to-night, without in- I
dorsing the candidacy of ex-Justice
Hughes for the Presidency. The Hughes
men undoubtedly had the votes to put
through their resolution, but the tactics
of the anti-Hughes men prevented the
resolution from coming up for passage.
Wiliiam H. Hotchkiss, the Hughes
leader in the committee, made the mo-1
tion to adjonrn, and he prefaced it
with the statement that any indorse
ment from a committee which had
acted as it had during the day would
be an insult to any sel.'-respecting man.
Mr. Hotchkiss also said that he would
BOt attend another meeting of the
Progressive State Committee this year.
He said he was through with this par- ;
ticular brand of Progressivism entirely. j
Hughes Men Quit Struggla.
The Hughes men will not bring the
question of the indorsemer.t of the
nominee before another meeting of the
committee. It is their intention to is- ,
sue a letter supporting Mr. Hughes,
and they are confldent that they will
have the r.ames of 110 of the 150 state
committeemen signed to it. No action
was taken by the committee on the in
dorsement of Justice Seabury for Gov?
ernor. His name was not even men
tioned.
Mr. Hotchkiss introduced his reso?
lution to adjourn after a conference of
the Hughes men. It was agreed that
Mr. Hughes in justice to himself could
not accept an indorsement onder the
c.rrums'-ances.
V.'hile Mr. Hotchkiss was prefacing
the introduction of his resolution with
a statement of his vjj^ws or. the gen?
eral behavior of the meeting, two po?
licemen with drawn nightsticks stood
at the back of the hail, looking threat
eningly at August Srhwar7.1er, of The
Bronx, who insisted on demanding a
vote on a motion he had introduced
just before adjournment. Schwarzler
was so persistent that the policemen
started for him. but a number of com
rni'tcemen interfered.
O'Connell .Stilla the Tumult.
Schwarzler subeided, and then a
dozen of the anti-Hughes committee?
men thought they oaght to say aome?
thing. In vain Walter Johnson, ehair
.... <f the committee, rapped for or- ?
der and tried to explain that a motion
to adjourn was not debaiahle. This
made no difference. The anti-Hughes
Progressive? were there to prevent the
indorsement of Mr. Hughes, and they
apparently did not know they were ac- i
complishing it through the Hotchkiss I
resolution until John J. O'Connell, :
chairman of the New York County ? ,
Progressive Committee, and leader of
? he Bnti-Hughes forces, gained the
floor long enough to say that the mo- I
tion to adjourn was all right.
Then there was another wrangle over
the rollcall. Finally Bainbridge
Colby suggested to Mr. Hotchkiss that
if he withdrew the statements he had
made oreviously to introducing the
resolution to adjourn the motion would
go through. This Mr. Hotchkiss did,
and the adjournment was taken with ,
practical unanimity, with a few of the ,
frreconcilables still looking for a fight.
The anti-Hughes men claimed the
failure of the meeting to indorse Mr.
Hughes as a victory. Bamhridge Colby
saul that by doing ao the committee had
repudiated the action of the Progres- '
sive National Committee and had
placed itself in the column with New
Jersey and other states which had done
the same thing.
Mr. Hotchkisa Eiplains.
Late to-night Mr. Hotchkiss issued a
statement ifl which he said that a poll
taken unofficially showed M votes for
Hughes to 60 for the anti-Hughes men.
Diacnaaing the adjournment of the
meeting, he said:
"I moved the adjournment after this
afternoon's stormy session. because I

Mr Hughes had the majority of votes

I/mdon. July 22.?What kind nf fot is this "Great Amphibiar."

Many valiant enemie-s haa the Prussian army fought in the last 300
years, on the whole with a halance of good fortune, but hero is something
r.ew altopether.
Never before have- the force and science of Central Europe come into
armed conflict with the western island. Far back along the fading paths
of history crusading armies moved across the salt wat/r to the fray.
The chivalry of Creoy and the archer-a of Agineourt, who disombarked
upon the coast of France; the sea rovers who affronted the power of Philip
II on the Spanish Main and the soldiers who withstood him in the Low
Countries; the armies of William III and the Duke of Marlhorough,
humbling the glory of Louis XIV; the far-ranping ships and stubborn
infantry that sustained a preat kinp in one century and warred down a
preat emperor in the next?all had one birthplace, all were manifes
tations of one peculiar form of power.
German Rage Against England.
Now at last Prussia- the embodiment of all that land enerpy could
pive? must join in unrelcnting conflict with the Great Amphibian. It is
no small proof of the shrewdness of the Prussian military instinct that
they reaiized at once where the peril lay, and even while the German
armies rolled forward to the terrific assault on the French frontier, or
drew up to withstand at heavy odds the hosts of the fzar, their hate and
rage were conc-entrated upon the unorganized, black-coated, commen-e
absorbed, politics-loving state which could scarcely at the outset put 150,
000 men in the field.
Berlin mobs insulting with vulgar fury the departing British Am?
bassador expressed the same well founded apprehension as the discern

HETTY GREEN
LEFT $100,000-000
Estimate Made as Will Is
Read in Court?State's
Fee To Be $20,000.
Bellows Falls, Vt., July 22. It was
estimated in legal circles here to-night
that Mrs. Hetty Green left an estate of
approximately $100,000,000. Charles W.
Pierson, of New York, representing
Mrs. Green's son, Colonel Edward H. ;
R. Green, agreed to-night upon a ten
tative administration fee of $20,000 to
be paid to the state, and it is consid?
ered that this fee is an indication of
the total value of the estate on the
basis of fee percentages as usually fig
ured.
Colonel Green is now sole executor
of the estate, aince it was announced
to-day that his sister, Mrs. Matthew
Astor Wilks, had declined formally to
act as executrix with him, as directed
by the will. The Probate Court to-day
admitted the will to probate without
opposition.

ter, Mrs. Matthew ttatO. Wilks. It il
specitically provided that the trustees,
Colonel Green and his sister, shall not.
be required to tiie ar. inventory or ap

'Br <"|M* tn Th* TrfNin*.!
I.ondon, July 22.?While the cen
sorship has apain drawn a blanket
ever the Allies' activities on the
Western front and the official bul
lotins record nothing beyond scat
tered and minor engagements and
a heavy artiilery fire from both
sides, the paucity of news deceives
no one here. All recognirje that the'
Britiah are now concentrating their
foroei fot the assault on the third
and strongest German line beforo
Bapaume.
The presence. reported from Ber?
lin. of British cavalry on the lines
indicate.s what may shortly happen.
The present comparative quiet may
represent the hush before the most
important events of the Allied of?
fensive. Cavalry can only be of use
when trench fighting is over and the
enemy has been driven into the open.
The line of trenches which the Brit?
ish now face is undeTStood to be the
last of the German "permanent de-j
fences. ?
Expect New Britiah Attempt.
The report of intense bombard
ments may mean either or both of
two things?a preparation by the
British to renew their offensive or
a preparation hy the Germans to
launch another desperate counter at-,
tack in a final effort to save their'
front from being pierced.
It il taken for granted here that j
the British are planning fresh ef- ?
forts. General Haig's report that
tho Germans are using tons of ex
plosiVfl and tear-produeing shells,
nnd both British and French reports
of (ierman attacks, which, while not,
important, may have been in thc;
nature of feelers, cause the belief
that the Germans, too, contemplate
an attack. Which will be launched
first, and how great a force the Ger?
mans have been able to gather, can
only be guessed. The British are
confident of holding their gains.
They are sure the German charge
will break down, as the last one did,
and that the British will again
push forward.
Forer.ee (ireat German Thnista.
There is no tendency to underestt
mate the Btren--th which auch a Ger?
man thrust will ahow. It is expected
to measure the force that the Kaiser
7an muster, and that it will prove mur
lerous and hornbly costly to stop.
The German claim made to-day that
:he offer.jive has been stopped ifl
aURhed at here. It is pointed out that
there have been two such claims made
aefore smce the otfensiv* sUrted, and
that both have speedily been proved
false. 0
Most of the news from the front to
"ay comes from the German report. Be
sides the statement that the British
'were unable to resume their large,
?niform thrust," Berlin tells of ciear
ing out a nest of British soldiers in
the Foureaux Wood and cAptaring
'some dozen," and says that offensives
by Bnti?h or French have failed at
Massiges and near Fleury, in the Ver?
dun ?fla**l
The French, on the other hand, re?
port a .-ucces^ful attack at Fleury and
tell of German bombardment of that
pluce and the Fumin Wood. They have
repulsed German thrust* near St, Die,
la the V*Oflfl""**>i where a strong attack
was made, ar.d at Moulin-sous-Tout
rent ar.d south of Damloup. The first
sign ut activity for over a year near
Belfort comes in a report of the bomb
mg of the town by German aeroplanes.
Britiah Report D?y Quiet.
To-night's British statement reads:
**The day passed without the occur?

SHOT FIRED IN
U=B0AT HUNT
British Cruiser Uses

to Be Near.

Norfolk, Va., July 22.- A British
cruiser patrolling off Virginia Beach
fired a shell across the bow of some |
vessel this morning. The incident;
caused much exeitement among hun-1
dreds of summer colonists who saw j
the warship as she turned immediately ?
after the report of her gun and dashed j
fall speed out to sea. ?
Some who witnessed to-day's inel-j
dent off Virginia Beach said she came '
to a halt and evidently investigated the '
statns of the craft she had halted and
that the ship was allowed to proceed.
Others insist that the warship con
tinued to race out to sea and disap
peared.
Say Bremen Was Sighted.
There are some who believe that the
warship sighted the German undersea
merchantman Bremen and fired a shot
across her how as a 6ignal to surren
der, but that the l.'-boat immediately ,
submerged and made a getaway. Naval
experts scout this theory, declaring
that the Bremen, if she is already off
tha Capes, will not attempt to enter:
the bay before nightfall.
From the *.ame source that told two
weeks ago of the approach of the
Deutaehland came a prcdiction to-day
that the Deutschland's sister ship, the
Bremen, would pass in the Virginia
Capes before Monday.
There was no ofticial authority for
tha news, but it spread quiekly and
generally was credi'ed. EfOOB after
nightfall several vessels, some of them
___rry.Bg newspaper correspondents and
photographers, started for Cape Henry
through a heavy rainstorm, hoping to
aa;- esa the arrival of the undersea.
craft. It was believed that if the boat
reached the coast during the night she
would head ia immediately. As the
storm made conditions most favorable,
she was expected to go directly to Bal?
timore, stoppmg only to pick up a
Maryland pnot.
Ingenious Theory Advanced.
According to theories advanced to?
day, the Bremen and the Deutaehland
arill act in uni.ion, as follows:
The Deutaehland. which is expected
down from Baltimore early to-mor?
row, will boldly proceed to the Capes
and remain there in full view of the
Allied warship.. Under cover of dark
ness the Bremen is to run in past the.se
ships, while submerged, and arill quiet?
ly come up alongside of her sister
ship. Simultaneously the Deutschland
-rill submerge and da.h to sea. The
U-boats beiBf exaci counterparts, it is
claimed that the British cruisers will
not detect that the Deutschland has
moved. Giving the Deutschland sev?
eral hours' start, the Bremen will then
enter the bay and proceed to Balti?
more.
Agents of the Bremen are also re?
ported to be cruising off the Capes to?
day, keeping an eye on the Allied war
ships and reporting for the benefit of
the Deutschland, and possibly the Bre?
men.
The belief is general here that the
Bremen is either just off the Capes or
is r.earing the bay entrance.

By ARTHUR S. DRAPER,
London, July 22.?Following np
their great victory of yesterday
along the Lipa and Styr riv<>rs,
6outhwest of Lutsk, the Russians
to-day smashed the retreating Teu?
ton forces at Berestechk and rwept
forward to the Northern Galician
frontier.
The disorganiTjed fordjea of von
Linsingen are to-night still falling
back along the Styr, leaving the
Russians in control of both sides cf
the stream and all its crossings.
General SakharofTs thrust, as yet
cnly two days o!d, has won for him
practieally the who'.e lines of tha
Lipa and the Styr, has driven the
enemy hack nearly twenty miles and
has adda*-d more than 12,000 prison?
ers to the now huge total in the East
front fighting.
By forcing the Austro-German
armies back from the confluenei of
the Lipa and the Styr yesterday
Sakharoff immediately exposed the
enemy forces on the ?outh bank of
the Lipa to a flank attack. Antici
pating this, von Linsingen to-day
withdrew his troops thirteen miles
up the river, leaving the Russians in
possession of the entire right bank
up to that point.
Cleaared Whole Salient.
In other words, the Russians hava
cleared out the whole Lipa-Styr
salient between Berestechk, the con
fluence of the rivers and a point
sli^ntly west of Golatin, Another
day will probably see the abandon
ment by the Teutons of the Horv
chof-Golatin-Pruskopol sector, now
under attack from two sides, and
their withdrawal to new lines over
the frontier and behind the Luga
River. Along the west bank of thi
latter stream, the Austrians and
Germans must check the Russian ad?
vance or virtually give up all hopa
of saving Vladimir-Volynski from
investment. And the fall of that
town would carry the greatest men?
ace of the offensive to KoveL
General SakharofTs brilliant fltroke,
in fact, has plaeed the Austrians in tha
most dangerous predicament of th?
war. I'tiless the Russians can be held
off from Lemberg and Kovel, either by
way of Vladimir-Volynski or the Stok?
hod line, the Austrian annies, worn
out and lepleted, and looking in vam
for help from the Germans, are doomed
to an ignominioua retreat over tha
whole face of Galicia and into thfl
shadow of the great Carpathian wall,
and the greater part of Poland will
once more be freed of German troopa.
Suceesaea North and South.
Mear.while the Russian armiea in the
North and South are continaing their
successes. Kuropatkin's f.erce blowa
aouth of Riga have pierced the German
first line at several points, and tha
peopie of towns and villages even
twenty-five miles behind von Hinden
burg's linea are rcportad to be fleemg.
Considerable mystery attaches to the
operations on this front. Racent Ger?
man communiques admitted the pas
sage of Russian troops acrosfl the Dvina
at several points. According to nvs
sages from Petrograd, the Russian pub?
lic, despite the reticence of the General
Staff, generally regarda the movement
as the f.rst stage of a great Russian
drive in tne northern sector.
Ruaaian Statement.
To-night's Russian ttaUment says:
"On the left wing of tho Riga posi?
tions there have been aeveral fierce en
gagementa with the enemy. Our troopa
penetrated the enemy'a first line worka
at several pomta. The artiilery of both
sides is engaged heavily.
"On the left bank of tha Lipa, near
the village of Zweniatchi, east of uoro
hova, our patrols suecessfully raided a
German post, capturing its entire forcs,
consisting of an officer and forty-twa
men."
