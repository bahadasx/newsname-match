LONDON, July 22 (11 p. m.) The
entente allied offensive which
swings between the western and east
ern fronts with almost clock-like reg
ularity and in a manner almost com
pletely to prevent the central powers
from making any considerable trans
fers of troops from front to front now
Is centered on the Kussian front. The
forces under General Sukharoff have
taken the offensive energetically and
their victory In the salient formed by
the Junction of the hi pa and Styr
rivers souhwest of Lutsk, today ap
pears to tie much more important than
cither the official claims from Pet.-o-grad
or the Austro-tierman admis
sions of yesterday indicated.
(ieneral Sukharoff has the enemy
retreating In disorderly flight before
his forces. Having forced he passage
of he Styr and Lipa, the Itusslan
troops already are beyond Berestechk,
having in two days fighting taken
prisoner from the Austro-Uermans
three hundred officers and twelve
thousand men. In addition the Rus
sians have captured a quantity of war
booty. The number of Austro-Ger-man
captured In the operations on the
eastern front since July IS now totals
twenty-six thousand.

Germans from the Styr-Li pa salient.
General Sukharoff has established his
forces firmly on the right bank of the
l.ipa up to about twenty kilometers
(about thirteen miles) about its con
fluence with the Styr.
Meanwhile General Kuropatkin Is
still pressing forward against the
forces of Field Marshal von 1 linden
burg on the Dvlna front south of Kiga
and north of Smorgon. Acording to
military critics In Petrograd a battle
Is in preparation in the neighborhood
of Kovel, the objective of the Russian
drive across the Stokhod which will
prove one of the most important con
flicts of the whole war.
No striking news was received from
the western front today except reports
of heavy artillery actions by both
sides.
The British press gives great prom
inence to statements published in the
French press and credited to General
Joffre and Sir Douglas Halg, the
llritish commander. The former Is
reported as saying the entente allies
now have tho whip hand over the cen
tral powers, whilo General Haig said
the supreme decision of the war must
be made on the western front.

That the laws of Oklahoma make
no provision regarding the withdrawal
of candidates for county offices was
the statement yesterday of Joe W.
Kenton, secretary of the county elec
tion board.
"We are supposed to go ahead with
the printing of ballots as soon as the
filings are closed," said Mr. Kenton.
"Occasionally we do permit a candi
date to withdraw after he Is filed,
hut It is only a matter of courtesy.
We have done this recently for both
Democratic and Republican candi
dates and there Is nothing suspicious
t all about our having the ballots
printed when we did. There Is no
law In existence which states that a
man may withdraw froTi tho race
within ton days of the election. If a
candidate wants to withdraw nftor tho
ballots are printed we usually give
him that privilege, providing he pay
for the cost of changing the ballots."

Th above picture, made a few minutes before the cave-In at the Third

of tho accident. The ditch was about 15 feet deep. Water trickled con
stantly from the broken end of the 14
the ditch a big fire department steamer was hooked up. As can bo seen,
it rested close to the curbing. The constant vibration of the engine gradu
ally loosened the dirt under the pavement, and suddenly the dirt and curb
ing gave way. Several men were caught In the debris. Most of them
extricated themselves. Two were almost out when a second cave-In oc
curred, burying them seven feet under
hard work to remove the heavy engine, the big pieces of concrete and
the dirt before the bodies of the buried men could bo rcovered. The pic

ditch. Supports had been placed at exactly the point where th- r,i :i

CIlllir.MUA CITY, Mexico, July
'.'2 - Details of an all-day run
ning ciit'tagemcnl near Hacienda KI
l'loiidu, almost directly south of Par
ral on the Chihiiahua-I Miranso bor
der, between the command personally
directed by Villa and C irran.a troops
were leceived here today. i Ieneral
Jacinto Trevino, commanding the
army of the northeast, announced
that the dispatches showed that the
Villista power in Mexico had licon
ffectiially broken and that it is only
a matter of a few da.vs until Villa
himself is captured or killed.
The reports said that only the bet
ter iiioiinls of the tllislas allowed
t heir .leader to escape.
The dispatches, which were sent
from liosario by ieneral Isinael Ijir
ties for ticncral Matias itamos, coin
mantling the government forces n.
that sector, und were relayed here
from Jiinniez by (ieneral Domingo
Arrieta, said that 111 the engagement
which took place last Saturday ap
proximately two hundred Villistas
wi re killed. The llirrati.ista losses
were not given definitely. They slated
that Villa was driven first to seek
refuge on the San Isidro ranch and
being dislodged there was pursued
more than fifty miles into the stat
of Durango. It was pointed out that
a result of the engagement was to
prevent the bandits rea lilng their ob
jective In tho Sierras and in keeping
them in the comparatively open coun
try of the lower Nii7.as river.
I legat! in Morning.
The battle was begun early In the
morning, the attack being made In
four columns, directed by (ieneral
Itanios oil the center and left by lien
eral Krnesto liarciu on thp right and
Cciieral Lames on the south, to the
bandits rear.
Covet n nt troops engaged in two
sharp skirmishes with Villistas today
and Were victorious in t h noor.l-
ing to dispatches to I ieneral Trevino.!
lieneral Jose Santos reported from1
Parral that he had defe.uted with1
heavy losses a small bind under the
leader Torres at P0117.0 De Calvo, half
way between Torreon and Kaltillo, 1
while lieneral Iivcaga telegraphed
from Tepehuanes that he had beaten j
off a small force near that town.
lieneral Santos said that he had
hui prised the bund of more than a.
hundred near a waterhole and had
killed six and captured three, who
wire executed later. I
He suffered no casualties, but seized'
nl It he arms and saddle: horses of the i
bandils, who carried awtiv 11 wound
ed, hi caid. The dispatch continued
that a column hail been sent in pur
Kuit of the fleeing outlaws, the first
to le seen in the district for about
two months.
The land ingaged by (ieneral Ii
Viaga apparently was a .(mall I'etach
ment which had separated from ttie
main command. The bandits refused
t.ett'e. iiecori inir t i dispatches, nnd
retired under fire toward the hills
11s th" government troops advanced.
Additional advices to the com
inLni'aela said that a Jupancyc physl
r in n who hid treated Villa in the
town of of Torreon De Cam, south of
I.c-s Nieves. recertly reported that
Villa is still badly crippled and re
quires nn operation, but before this
cocbl be done he must hsvn two
wicks of a''!'!ute rest end that even
then complete recovery cannot be as
sured. t'pon receipt of this report Cicn
iral llervinn announced that he ex
pects dlsiKilcli.s at any lime telling
r f the defeat of the bandit chief and
bis follower-!, who ate sin-rounded by
the t rccn of Oenerals Matias Itamos
at d Krnesto (iareia.
"Me will not get two hours' rest,
much less two wec!;s, if we can help
It," he said.
All rcport.i l.ere agree that the 1

We arrived here early this morning
and all day long every man in tho

for the first day of rest. Monday
permanent arrangements will be

At Kingsvillu they promised us free

they had no water for bathing pur

go around. Then wc were delayed on
tho way here so that we didn't know
what San Itenilo is like until 4 o'clock

which ti e publication of a list of S7
American individuals and linns uith
which Knglish lirms are forbidden to
do business under the lia.ling-with-Ihe-cnemy
act has met in America
and here I-amirg Wnrthinglon
Kv.ins. chief 01 the department of for
eign trade of the foreign 'illlce made
the following statement to the Asso-
cialiil liesj today:
"Thii i.tatutory list has been ci m
piled from one poll. I of view only
namely to prohibit llritish eiti.uns
from supporting firms which arc
strengthening our enemies. The test
applied before pi tting a linn domi
ciled in America on the statutory list
is I his: Is t luit linn by its bl'Hl!les
operations strengthening our ene
mies'.' if so, then PriUsh funis mav
nut support it
It is one ot tho principal lessons
of tho world win mat the strength
of a belligerent dims n.'t consist only
111 the resources am: supplies avail
able iu Its own territories, but also
in those which It can d'aw from neu
tral countries. As a result of the
seml-mllitai y organization which the
(lei man government has imposed on
its commerce, ever; lenuan llrm
throughout the world is an outpost,
reeking lo do ils utmost to assist Ger
many in hei effort to dominate llu
rope, and the fact that they are estab
lished in neutral countries in many
cases makes thorn mure formidable.
Must 1 rust rate Plans.
"Can it thon be said fairly that
when the Kritish government is fully
aware of these activities It should do
nothing to frustrate them? Can It be
claimed fairly that instead of endeav
oring to frustrate them, they should
be actually assisted hy llritish firms,
H 1 i I in 1 1 cables, llritish banks und
llritish snipping lines'.'
"It may be pointed out that long be
fore the llritish slatutory black list
was put in operation the Wrench gov
ernment prohibited ils nationals from
doing any business with any enemy
subject. It can hardly be contended
that the statutory black list is more
onerous to trade than the Preach sys
tem which long since was recognized
by International law.
"Moreover. from strictly legal
points of view, tho black list system is
a piece of purely domestic Ii gislivtior.
which simply prohibits llritish sub
jects from dealing with certain per
sons. The right of any government to
impose such prohibition on its own
nationals is hardly open to dispute.
"Objection has been taken to the
unpleasant publicity given the list, but
Vithout such publicity far more dam
age would be likely to result to trade.
Itefore the adoption of the statutory
black list there was an unofficial black
list In existence. Kxperience has shown
that uncertainty on the part of both
British and neutral tiaders as to who
is and who is not on the black list
would be the cause of more confusion
than the publication of the black list.
Say List I iiiiinati.
Complaint !s made 'hat the statu
tory list Is unnecessary because the
same ie:,alt.. inicht have been ob
tained sub rosa. lint if so done, it
would have affected not merely the
firms in the I nited States which now
tignre in the statutory lis, but also
ot hers probably all tin so of Herman
mines whether they deservud it or
not, because llritish trades to Ahom
alone our pmhibitjnn is aldressed.
would not have known the names of
the prohibited lirms and m.gl.t out
of caution have erased dcalinn with a
inn h larger number.
"It has been said that it was a
blonder to piiblbh the list when a
I'n lull loan was un ler way. Clearly
it wo ild (rive lieeii a blunder to In
clude the I fiends of . .11 r French al'ies.
'lot Ii it scggcs'cd that this blunder
has been committed .'
"It Is Indeed only those who have
shewn U'linistnkahly that they -ire
enemies or actirg for enemies who
arc included. So we netwl not lear
that the support of our lYcich allies
nil1 le prejudiced in those quarters.
"All the tai ls are uirefuily welched
hi fore the dc'-ision w as arrived at,
nnd I have no doubt that there is not
a name on the bst which is not ihcre
on evidence whiih lully justified its
incl U.-lull."
.Mr. h .an? denied that a --11b rosu
Ma. de list now exists, the 01 ly l.;i.,is
for such a charge, ho .'aid, being ihe
tact that certain tirn s are under sus
picion and Iintish traders therefore
have been -.varm 1 to be careful in
dealing with them. Mr. Kvans a.'srt
pi'inte.l out that there arc hardly
more than thiily eiiti:ie: in tie Amer
