grains, as well as providing nat

cause of inducing Northern

Land men predict that many new
tiers from eastern states will take
their abode in this region early
wxt spring They base their opin

FOUR-HORSE LOAD
OF LIQOUR TAKEN
CONTRABAND FROM MONTANA
IN CHARGE OF HILLIARD GRIl|
BER 18 CAPTURED BY SHERIFF
AT CARMEN BRIDGE.
If you should so far forget yourself
to stake reputation and a good
many dollars in the hasard of hauling
Montana contraband all the way from
Wisdom to Salmon, wouldn't it dis
courage any such law-breaking to get
caught with the goods?
Such has been the ending of these
unlawful enterprises more than once,
that the answer to the query la
that boozeleggers are hard to dis
courage.
The last to get caught was Hil
liard Grieber, a well-meaning and in
dustrious man whose father held
place in tlie esteem of all his acquain
tances I m the lower Salmon river knd
whose family name 1s a good name.
Young Grieber's exposure came last
Monday night, when the sheriff's of
fice was apprised that he was on the
road from over the hill by way of Glb
bonsville with a four-horse load of
liquor carried on a sleigh. Sheriff
Stroud and Deputy Casterlin met the
Grieber outfit at the Carmen bridge
little before midnight.
What have you there?" the sheriff
asked of the traveler.
Just a little jag of hay," replied
Grieber.
"What is there under the hay?
was the further query.
The officer was frankly told that It
was whiskey. Then he took a ride
with Grieber and took him td jail.
When the invoice was taken ttf the
jag it was found to consist Of one
sixteen-gallon keg and twenty-six
cases of liquor to be added (o the
stock held under strong lock as evi
dencp in such cases, later to be pour
ed into Jesse creek.
The day after the episode (he ac
cused waived a hearing and secured
bail, which was fixed by Judfie Mc
Cracken at $1,000.
STARTLING MENACE PRESENTED
BY MAJOR GENERAL OF ARMY
About the most startling matter be
fere the American people is a late
recommendation from Major General
Scott that we raise forthwith an
anuy of 1,500,000 men.
He believes such an army is made
necessary by the fact that Great
Britain now has an army practically
as large as the armies of the other
gi eat European powers. Thfse other
powers General Scott ignores. The
nn nace, as he sees it, comes from the
British empire in alliance with Japan
Whenever Americans have express
ed themselves dubiously and sus
piciously about the treaty between
N.
ary
for
in
be
England and Japan there have been
well-meaning Anglo-Saxons on both
sides of the sea ready to lead a
chorus whose theme has been "War
between the two great Engllsn-speak
jin e powers Is unthinkable." General
ing powi
scott knows that a good many
"un
thinkable" things have happened in
the last two years. The old founda
tions of the world have been shaken
loose. None of us can tell what struc
ture are to remain standing and what
aie to fall. At all events, it is not
the business of the chief of staff to
consider political, social or sentimen
tal reasons overmuch He views the
military situation with the cold and
cynical eye of the old soldier who has
lost all illusions about sacred treaties,
lasting International friendships and
permanent peace
General Scott's demand-for a train
ed military force of 1,500,000 men has
its origin in the theory' that the Unit
ed States could be invadefd as soon as
its navy was wiped off the seas by
the dominant naval power He seems
to take it for granted that such a dis
aster is certain And yel most Amer
icans who see tbe tremendous expen
dilute for naval purpose» will, in view
of what the general has said,ask
themselves what are all these billions
worth if they cannot give us a navy
that can hold the seas itt case of war
1 * ». get the drift of the general's log
jc an army of 1,500.000 would not be
necessary if our navy were able to
maintain Itself upon the seas This
uggests that the American people
,.,n escape from universal military
11 ainmg by making their navy bigger
and bigger, regardless of cost.
I ni 11 the Panama canal Is an open
w.iterwav every day th the year and
every hour in tbe day our navy. In
, ase ot war. cannot defend both the
Vlaniic and Pacific coasts It Is very
doubtful whether, should we be at
t. iked by a European and an Asiatic
natal power simultaneously, our navy
w , uld be able to keep the seas even
the canal clear We face the
of maintaining the world's

I necessity

that can resist »»> '"v" ^

A CALL TO MAKB SALMON ♦
INVITING AND BEAUTIFUL ♦
—
By Newton Hlbtoe. +
|++ + + + + ♦♦ + ♦♦ + ♦♦♦ ++
The Salmon school grounds and
park should be subjected to a cam
paign of improvement and that cam
paign should be organised without
delay. The door has heen opened for
great progress and prosperity lor the
city anti the country. The prime
need* of the time are good roads and
civic beauty
The little Salmon park can be
made one of the greatest assets ot the
onintunliy by the application of the
ist principles of art in Its improve
lm-m and embellshmeni. This work
should be outlined and insured by ac
turn during the winter, and then the
execution of tbe details will advance
in season without expense or worry
The condition of the Salmon school
grounds should be seriously consider
ed by all refined citizens of Salmon
The summer condition of these
grounds is a shock to the class of
people who are coming to make the
progress and wealth of the commun
Spreading trees with waving
leaves over velvety lawns lu publie
places invite the class of strangers
who will build for a great future for
Salmon and Lemhi county. Sun re
flections from desert dusF and stones
repel sensitive natures, and when In
telligence and the governing senti
ments of true refinement are shocked
the forces which build up prosperity
cannot be retained for the more sor
did demands of tbe country' A cam
paign for civic beauty is the first
need ot Salmon and Lemhi county.
The courthouse lawn is the only ex
ample required to establish the fact
hat our public grounds may be made
beatiful by very limited expenditure
a no the invocation of artistic taste.
These grounds are admired by every
edited visitor in the summer season
The school grounds have exacted the
■xpenditure of more public money
han has been expended on the court
house grounds. These grounds were
rugged and unsightly in their natural
taie, but the true art that assists nu
lure made a beauty spot out of a rug
Hillside. Not so with the school
house ground*. The expenditure of
public funds on these grounds de»
d the natural outlines and left an
uglv expanse of cinders, sand and
stones with rugged points exposed
Every romping child with »wealed
face dusted in blotches, and every
1res» and blouse made grimy in
day calls for shade velvety grass on
he school ground*. Every family
w ho comes to build up the city and
country ask» for civic beauty and
good taste asks for civic beauty to
.«•gin at the school grounds where

No great fund I» required to make
Salmon the most beautiful city in tbe
state. All we need is a scheme and a
