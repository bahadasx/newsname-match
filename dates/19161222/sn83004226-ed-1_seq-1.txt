MONEY IN CHICKEN'S CROP.
While dressing a chicken the other
day Mrs. John A. Stewart found a
bright dime In the fowl's crop. The
money waa minted In 1904, but "f
course, hod not been In the 'hliken
that long unless It started In a Chicago
tg and came on down througn several
generations. The fowl wns hounht
from Forrest Smith, the merchant at
CoMlle. With the reputation of re
turning money with each purchase Mr.
Smith may expect a rapid incrcuse In
business. Who knows how much mon
ey the next fowl mny contain If an
ordinary chicken holds a dime an eld
hen may have a quarter, and a turkey
at Thanksgiving prices ought to have
at least a five dollar gold piece In his
glxxard. Any old rooster looks like 10

DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION
TO
WILL SEEK TO HAVE THE LEG
ISLATURE OF 1918 SUBMIT
THE AMENDMENT.
The formation of an organization,
within the Democratic party in Ken
tucky, the object of which will be to
bring about action by the next regular
session of the General Assembly, at the
meetins: in January. 1918. unhmittln in
the people an amendment to the State
Constitution for Statewide prohibition,'
was set on foot In Louisville November
16 at a small gathering embracing some
of the best known men of the State.
They form but the nucleus of a body
that will be made up of men of their
standing and character in every coun
ty, scores of whom are already In touch
with the organizers. The plans of cam
paign that were laid are probably th
most thorough yet mapped out In auch
a fight in Kentucky. ,
The head of the new organization is
Dr. A. J. A. Alexander, of Woodford-co,
widely known philanthropist and ax
rlculturist who assumes the chairman-
.hln A r . r .. i , .. i - .
lsvllle, the well known business man
and student of public questions. As
sociated with them on the Executive
Committee are former Chief Justice J.
P. Hobson, of Frankfort; Dr. M. B. Ad
ams, of Georgetown; Dr. A. Gatliff, of
Williamsburg; the Hon. J. Guthrie
Coke, of L ogan-co.; former Circuit
Judge James M. Benton, of Clark-co.;
Henry M. Johnson, of Louisville, and
Ben B. Cosine, of Shelby-co.
' Permanent headquarters of the or
ganization will be opened almost Im
mediately. The campaign will be vig
orously conducted in every county In
the State In which there Is the slight
est prospect of naming a Democratlo
member of the House of Representa
tives, and In every district where a
State Senator is to be chosen. An Ex
ecutive Committee will be named in
each county and district, made up of
mn of the standing and type, of the
State Committee, and through these
county committees the campaign will
be carried into each precinct and to
every Democratlo voter. -
The men who have set on foot this
movement to settle the question of
prohibition in Kentucky believe that
their plan will be effective, more so
than if fostered only by a faction of
the Democratic party, as they plan to
bring together ' with them representa-'
tives of the great business interests
and people of all classes who are work
ing for improvements In the moral and
socuu conuiuon ox uie state.
Dr. Alexander, head of the movement
is one of the beet known men in the
bluegrass section of Kentucky. He is
at the head of Woodburn form, near
Spring Station, and has been promi
nent for a number of years in improv
ing the methods of agriculture and in
good roads. He is a graduate of Prin
