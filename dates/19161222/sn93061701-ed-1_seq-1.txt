A Veritable Inspiration
"Little lesg than an inspiration",

hat the New Mexico Building1
should be a replica of New Mexico's
... . .
most striking rranciscan mission,
that at Acoma. It complied with the
requirements of the Exposition au
thorities that all buildings ,on the
ground "must conform to the . ac
cepted type of Exposition architec
ture, the Spanish Colonial," and at
the same time typified the original
ity and the genius of New Mxico's
Spanish culture, When later, it was
adopted at the model for the new mu
seum structure at Santa Fe, then in
deed the Exposition Board and its
chairman felt that they had wrought
for all time.
