jDefcf Under Prohibition I
Nashville, Tcnn., Sept. 13. "TW
the adoption of prohibition by a nuin
ber of Southern States during tbi
E- ast few years lias largely increase
onded . indebtedness of the States,
counties and cities," says a local
authority, "is shown by statistics
gathered here by parties interested
in such securities. The States moo
affected by the prohibitive laws aro
Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina, Mississippi and West Vir
ginia." I
"Before iv.e prohibition laws "were
passed, au average Southern State
collected j"m the liquor traffic in
privilege lieuns and property tax a
half mi Dior? dollars a" year. Undo '
Southern tvx lav;s the counties ami
cities v;vrc vithurd to collect ta::r
from the suüi-j r..tce efjUcd to th...-.
collected, or imposed, by the Stat
So, while a Slate-wide prohibit?
law destroys State revenue it a;
destroys revenues of counties and ;
cities.
"Since adopting prohibit m, th
Stae of Tennessee 'has been cor
polled to increase its bonded deb :
more than a million, and to increas.
taxation. Six years ago the bond.y.
debt of the State was apDrcximate'
$11,000,000. At the present time i
3S about $12,500,000, counting sov
notes that are to be funded int,
thirty year bonds.
"The city of Nashv?lle cold bene'
early in the present year to th.
amount of ?987,Q00 to make up
deficit in its revenues, caused, arson.- .
ing to the officiate of the city, by trw
prohibition law cutting off revenue
from the liquor trafiic. At the samt
time an issue of $025,000 was offered
to m-ike up a deficit in the public
school fundi
"Memphis. Chattanooga and Knox
ville have also experienced trouh:
with their finances, and b-vids w :
issued to cover deficits. Tm. books e-
the city of Memphis are now bein
auditMtpMÄacerui,
to the "amount of $250,000 to covc
floating indebtedness caused by los
of revenue throu.j: the operations ot
the prohibition law. Knoxville lo t
about $35,000 a yar by tV samp
law, and this loss has been repaired
by higher taxes' or borrowing. The
State, counties and cities of Ten
nessee have issued bonds to the ap- ;
proximate amount of $i0,000,000,
largely to pay floating debts, since
prohibition was adopted.
"Only a few "weeks ago, Governor I
Henderson ox Alabama, sent a mes
sage to the Legis' aturc in which ho
called attention to a deficit of ap
proximately $3,0C0,Q00 in the rev
enues
ot
th'dt State. He re?om- ,
mended that bonds be issued & z ay it. ,
Alabama's deficit hr.3 been hanging
on for several years, originating un
der a prohibition administration.
Tfie increase in bonded indebtedness
in that btate has been equally as
1: rsre as in Tennessee.
"Georgia sold bonds to the amount
of $3.000,000 last fall to pay its float
ing debts. North Carolina was driven
Ho a bond issue last year o" $2,50ö,0GU
to pay floating debts, the duncit in hor !
revenues being aboutwhat had been j
lost through the operation of the pro -
hibitionlaw. j
''Mississlpprf or some time has been j
discussing a bond isue to cover j
dencit tnat exists in ner revenues.
The proposition in that Sfcirr is to
issue bonds to the amount of ?1,"00
000. It is well known that a iV.'-.nVrr
of these Southern States an: on thi J
T- - i i l . - p i

faults in the past and tvjeir securi-
ties, are not. considered, gük. edged . in.
some markets.
"West Virginia has just chanprr '
the custom of taking cars of dci'.ei4
in revenues. Finding that prohibi
tion laws had caused a less of $650,
000 a year to the State treasury,
Governor Hatfield recommended to
the Legislature that taxes be in
creased to cover the loss. Three ses
sions of the Legislature were nc
sary to get a satisfactory increase cn;
corporations engaged in developing
the resources of the State. Ho-j
ever, the tax rate on roal estate was !
increased from six mil's on the dalfar ;
to fourteen mills. ?.Ioney h being
