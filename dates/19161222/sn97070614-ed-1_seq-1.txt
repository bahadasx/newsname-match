Milk 'producers of this county have
made a demand for a year-round price
of $2.50 a hundred pounds of the Detroit
Creamery Co , the largest buyers here.
The price was recently raised to $2 but
it is claimed no money can be made at
that price with the present high cost of
feed. The producers also claim that
the grade of milk produced is better
than ever because of scientific feeding
and care, improved housing conditions
and better grade of stock. Tne price
was raised recently when a strike was
threatened, and now it is said Toledo
concerns are willing to pay the higher
price.

OVER 300 CONVERTS
Honeywell Campaign at Hastings I
Highly Successful.
From the Hastings Banner.
Dr. Honeywell and his party, closed
their: evangelistic campaign in Hast
ings Sunday night and the tabernacle
is being taken down and the lumber
and other material removed. ThP
roofing and seat ends will be shipped
to uwosso, and used in the construe
tion of a large tabernacle there, where
Dr. Honeywell and party will begbi
their campaign December 31.
The last week was the best of the
whole series of meetings. There was
much prejudice encountered against
such a campaign on the part of many
who had imagined what it would be,
and then were sure it would be what
they imagined. As the meetings pro
ceeded, and as people came to know
Dr. Honeywell, fessrs. Spooner, Rob
erts and George and Mrs. Hague, they
came to understand that these fine
.spirited, courteous Christian folks
1 W(l Quito different than they had
heard or imagined. If the meetings
c'lse far greater results would have
necn realized. Too many failed to
recognize this campaign as Hastings'
"time of visitation." and kept away
from the meetings, and so as fine as
the results are, they might have been
largely surpassed. ."
Sunday morning a large congrega-
lion ,,.oanl 1)r- Honeywell preach. In
the afternoon another larire assemhlv
,lstont, to a powerful aVlclrcss by him.
!ln tho c,vonin the tabernacle was
. lacked, and the congregation heard a
convincing sermon on the "Final
j Judgment." When the invitation was
"given lor those avIio desired to become
Christians to come forward, nearlv 50
responded, adults and young people,
and iii one case a whole family. It
'ex-!wa3 a moving sight to witness the
stream of folks going to the front
seats, with faces tense with the deter-
initiation to show what they proposed
to stand for and yet softened with the
strong emotions they experienced.
i mu uii v iiiym u innue tiieir tiecis-
in to lead a Christian life,
these in'H'tinjrs, of whom over 100 ox-
pressed no church preference, while
about 70 indicated that they preferred
the Uaptist church, over 100 the Meth
odist Episcopal, 33 the Presbyterian,
24 the United Brethren and 12 the
Weslcynn Episcopal, Catholic and
Christian Science churches.
One of the best results of the meet
ings was the fine spirit' shown toward
one another by the members and pas
tors of the co-operating churches. The
better- understanding of one another
and greater willingness to pull togeth
er on tlw'ir part is well worth the ex
pense of the campaign, and will bear
fruit in the future in a way that will
help Hastings.. There is no room and
no real reason for denominational
jealousy or narrowness, while there is
every reason for finding all the com
mon ground there is and getting opto
it and puling together.
Thpse who came to know .the 'mem
bers of the Honeywell party found
them very likable, very kind, ahd fine
folks in every way.
There was raised for the expenses
of the campaign about .1,750. All ex
cept about .$500 of this was spent for
labor and materials here in Hastings.
Dr. Honeywell himself paid half the
expenses of his party for the campaign
here, as well as serv ices for his ad
vance asrent, amounting to nearly
.$000. ' . ,
All the members 6f th? party left on
Sunday night for their homes, leaving
behind many friends who wjll always
think of them with pleasure.

MALLEABLES PLANT
SAND SHEDS DAMAGED TO EX-
A fire of unknown origin wrecked the
sand sheds at the American Melleablea
plant on Washington street Sunday
evening, causing a loss of over $4,000,
covered by insurance. A big pile of
pulverized coal caught fire and burned
fiercely for several hours, the sand be
came soaked with water and later frozen
and must be thawed out before becom
ing usable. The sand made fighting the
fire difficult because the firemen sank
in it and were unable to reach the best
spots to fight the fire. The blaze reach
ed the main building but was most for
tunately checked before it did serious
damage.
The building in which the fire oc
curred is 75x35 feet, 20 feet high, steam
heated, and contained mnch va'uable
machinery which was damaged, and a
mono rail system, and a facing machine
which were wrecked, while the heating
system was ruined.
Rebuilding and replacing were com
menced immediately, and work will be
delayed but a short time.
The entire fire fighting force of the
city was on hand and the good work
done undoubtedly eaven the main
plant.
