shipments of express to this office
are very heavy and it keeps the en
tire force hustling to handle it. As
usual most every one here has a
box or package to send to an absent
friend and likewise the absent friends
remember their Earlington friends.
The consequence is there is more or
WSi.doingat the express office these
days,
That Christmas turkey will taste
fine to-thoe who have the pri&

Snowfall Last Night"
The unusual sight of thunder and
lirhlnln? accompanying a snbwfall
fwws witnessed here last night. This
was due to the fact that while z rain
storm prevailed in the higher altitudes
it was colder in the lower and) the
rain was chanced into sno(v" before
il reached the earth. . A snowstorm
ragid for several hours and the snow,
fall amounted to five inches '
this 'section is having yyinfry
weathrr and the ground is covered
With ice and snow. The fall of snow
last night was a great benefit td peo
ple and stock, as it had been almost
impossible to walk without falling
for several days. Temperatures have
been low, too.
The weather conditions have
caused a great deal of sickness, con
fined chiefly to colds and lagrippesf

''The now fashionable blonre
is worn the way the Chinaman
wears his shirt outdide inttead

chemise blouse, but here in
America it's retorred to as the

These blouses may be ot trans

How To Fight
' The Liquor Habit
Do yon honesty want to stop
nuking? Then read an article
n liquor by Booth Tarkington
n. the January American Maga
zine in which he writes abont a
nan who says: i
"They tell mq tnere are dipso.
nauiaci, (rid there may b'e some
abnormal people who can.t turn
ho trick : bnt I atmott doubt it.
And 1 don't believe there's the
ilightest question of will power.
Never for one second did I con
'Ciously rxort my will, there
vasn't anything real to exert it
against. I didn't say to myself,
I will,' or 'I won,t.' 1 said,
'I've had my last,' and knew
that It wartroe. It didn't take
the will power, or the strength of
a caterpillar. It didn't take any.
I juBt rested a little, got my head
clear, and saw that I preferred a
real life, however little comedy I
found in it, to a drugeed one.
And, also, I preferred not to be a
sogiiy thing, myself. Fiuding
out that preference was import
ant, "After all, a miracle is only
Nature diing something we've
learned to pxpect her not tp do;
ud my miracle is one that will
happen t) any other man who'll
rest a while and conjnlt himself.
My recommendation is two weeks
in bed with nobody abont except
i servant to bring beef-tea and
toast.
Simple enough, isn't it.
Feed The Birds
At this period of the year with
the- ground all frozen and cover
ed with ico and enow these little
feathered neighbors of ours are
facing famine. They cannot
raise trembling bands aud beg
for charity, so we forget their
needs, and since they cannot
speik for themselves their friends
should never coaso to do it for
them in the same old words, win
ter after winter. "Do not clear
away the wild hedges leave somo
shock) of corn In your field scat
ter grain sweepings in likely
pi ices-fasten suet to your orchard
tree, and spread lunch counter
under your window out of the
reach of est'."
The tenderness rn tendered
from a simple service of this kind
is as satisfying to tkj soul as
prayer. '

TOO MANY MIDDLE MEN
Says a leading southern agricultu.
ral paper.
"bifteen just plain Mississippi
farmers got together without .any
frills, and shipped a car load of vet
ordinary hogs to St. Louis, gettufi
as high as ten cents a pound ty.
weight for them."
This item Jells a taTe that should
be of deep interest to every farmer
who has anything sell.
Why should it bethought necessar;
that everything produced on thclarhMf.
of our country Should go through the
hands of half a dozen middle men be
fore it reaches the consumer?
Tafee the case in point. Ordinar
ily these farmers would have sold to
a small stodk jobber, he to a shipper
he to another gp-between at the other
end 'of the route, when the stoda
would possibly have reached the pack
ers for whom it was intended. I
The action of those Mississipp
farmers is to be commended. Tl'
farmers of this community might dc
well to afford a like opportunity fo
commedation. I
They would get- more for UkF
products and trie ultimate consurr
in the end would pay less for v
necessities of life.
There are too many middle tr
And middle men are expensive !
in many cases wholly unnecessary.
