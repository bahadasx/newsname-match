HOME BUILDING
NOW GREATEST
EVER IN CITY
Number of Permits Issued
in 1916 Surpasses Record
By Hundreds.
VALUE OF BUILDING
LESS THAN IN 1916
Almost 2,000 Permits Issued
in First 11 Months
of 1916.
v
'Nineteen hundred and thirty-four
building permits, representing values
of . $6,586,229, were issued, in Bridge
port during the first 11 months of
1916, according to figures available to-
day at the office of the building com
missioners. Permits for -December,
will probably bring the total over 2,
000 with a property Valuation of more
than $7,000,000. .
- While the' total value of building
operations for the year will be less
than that of 1915, Building Inspector
Daniel M,, Rowland holds that this
year has shown - a substantial and
healthy growth. In 1915, several mil
lions of the aggregate values of $8,
789,814 were j represented in the de
velopment of many big manu f acturies.
There were 1,602 permits issued in
1915.,,.
That the city is making headway in
solving the housing problem is shown
by the fact that 786. permits for
dwelllnk houses of all types were is
sued in 11 nonths of this ye,ar, as
against 679 for the year of 1915.
The first 11 months of this year also

Hartford; Conductor -H. Cole, Canton
Flagman -John P. Bone, Hartford ;
Brake'man , Everett Sisson, of Hart-
ford, all of the regular freight. '
. A; mistake in orders is believed to
have been responsible for the wreck.
It is understood vthat when the.: extra,
left Hartford, it was given the right
of - way and that the regular had or-s
ders to meet it at Canton. Later thei
error in the orders, it da said, was dls-
covered in the office at Poughkeepsie
but efforts' to reach the regular were?
unsuccessful.' " ' '
. The crash ; occurred on : a grade
known aa Horseshde Bend- The east-
bouhd train was made up of -a loco-
motive and a few cars and was in
charge of Conductor . Fred Snow, ofi
Winsted. ( The extra was a. longer
train and. was drawn by two locorrio-
tivesii, Deenee was in the first of these.
Wherihe two engines r jammed to
gether some- of the cars buckled but
only a few were derailed. It was nec
essary to transfer - passengers around
the wreck... . .
The injured with the exception of
Flagman Cole, ,were brought to the
county hospital here. Cole was treat
ed at the . scene of the wreck and sent
to his home. Of the Qthers, all ex
cepting Conductors BuncSe and Snow,
left for ther homes soon after reach
ing the hospital. Buncee, who was
riding on ' the first i engine of the
extra was badly, scalded - and it is
fearedmay hav inhaled steam.
' According to the- stories of 4 En
gineers Sisson and Woodin, when
they saw the collision was inevitable,
they jumped, calling to their firemen
to do the same. The latter, however,
had' no chance to do 'so- and were
pinned to their seats as the engines
came together. " '. '' ,
Coroner S. AjHerrman visited the
scene of the wreck tand has begun

Testifying.
Testifying that they, heard blood
curdling cries one night in June, 1914,
John H. Ehrlaub and his mother, Ida
C. Ehrlaub, neighbors of, WilliamX IT.
Fair in Darien, proved important wit
nesses in the criminal superior court
this morning when the trialof Fair
and Jack Deveraux, charged with
manslaughter, was . resumed before
Judge Burpee and a jury.
John H. Ehrlaub was the first wit
ness introduced by the state. - He
said; his home was near the Fair
farm. One night in the latter part
of June. -1914, the witness and his
family were talking in the house
when suddenly they heard two cries.
The witness and his father decided
to investigate. They saw lights in the
Fair home but when they arrived near
the house the lights were extinguished
They knocked . on the door bUt re
ceived no reply. The witness and hi
father went back home. The next
morning they went again to the Fair
home and asked Fair about the cries.
Fair and Deveraux were seated in the
same room. They looked at each)
other and then Fair denied there hadj
b'een any cries coming from that
house. He said they had been obliged
to discharge a servant the day before.
Another important bit of testimony,
given by Ehrlaub was his statement
that he had seen a rifle' bf small bore
with a Maxim silencer attached at the
Fpir home. He, understood it belonged
to Deveraux. The witness had seen
Deveraux firing at , a target with the
rifle. B-e noticed that there was no.
sound of a report. '
i fOn cross examination Ehrlaub was
asked if there hadn't been some trou
ble between his father and Fair,, be
cause, of some flowers on' the Ehrlaub
property that had been damaged. The
witness said he didn't know anything
of such trouble. ; f
1631 C.VEhrlaub went infc more par
ticular detail regarding the crfes SKf
said she heard them . about 9 or 10
o'clock at night. She couldn't re?
member the exact date, but thought
It might have been June 26 or 27. The
cries were sp terrifying that Mrs. Ehr
laub said she. exclaimed "Good God;
what,, is that?" When her husband
and ,son started to go out to investi
gate she Jield them back for a min
ute, saying "It may be a holdup." ;
When asked on cross examination
to tell just how the .cries sounded
Mrs. Ehrlaub. said the first sounded
like that of a wormin and the second
sounded like a woman being choked.
Letters were introduced which were
written by Fair to M. Gautier Feath
erly of Mt. Vernon, N Y. In;' these
letters, written in 1915, Fair said he
Jvas worried about the disappearance
of. his wife. 1 He declared he had suf
fered enoAlgh at her hands.' He. told
Featherly' he thought she" might have
gone to Havana and in another letter
he said, "She might have done the
trick."; j 1 .
The body of Mrs. Fair, whom Fair
and Deveraux are accused of v killing,
was found in August, 1914. "

" London, Dee. 22. The British gov
ernment will make no statement at
the present in . regard i to President
Wilson's peace . note, considering it a
question than can be dealt with only
in communication with the other
members Jof the entente. Announce
ment to this effect was made In the
House of Commons today by Andrew
Bdnar Law, chancellor of the ex-
chequer and government! leader in the
House. ' ;--'.
Mr. Law was asked whether a state
ment could be made regarding the
American note. He replied: .
. "It . must be obvious to the - House
that this is a . question that can onlyi
be, dealt with in communication with
our allies and that it is absolutely lnn
possible to make a statement now."' I
The Evening Standard says:
. "Any comnunication from the
head of a great and friendly power, is
assured of courteous and respectful
consideration; but it would be ,only
misleading the President to leave him
under the impression that any move
on his part toward peace at this stage
f Hhewar would ; bev welcomed by
Great - Britain or her . allies.
"It is singular . indeed, that- states
men of Mr. Wilson' perspicacity can
)la6r under , such an illusion.- The
whole facts- of the situation should
warn him" that hi, intervention , is
'not desired. j i .
"He speaks of a league to -ensure
peace and justice. Such ft league al

Britain, 'Russia,v France, Italy and the
smaller powers. All have had un
uphill fight. They now see the road
fairly clean before them. The ene
my has given a shrill cry .of distress.
The next few months ought to com
plete his discomfort.
"If the President could realize what
these war-worn peoples feel he would
surely not suggest that they, should
forego all their-cherished hopes and
trust tneir very existence once more
to .rotten parchment bonds." .

BEDFORD HMDS STANDARD OIL
A. C. Bedford, cousin of E. T.' Bed

of ,New Jersey to succeed the late
John D. Archbold. Mr. Bedford has
for some years been vice president
and" treasurer of; the compamc

at the White House. Virtually all f
them construed the note as a move
for peace. - They came from Individ
uals and organizations. . '

Diplomats , here are eagerly watch

There is growing .feeling, that th
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for views and possibly
for terms of the belligerents. Several
of the diplomats have advised their'
governments to that effect in order tq
guide-them in their 'replies. 1 ;
Surprise at the faet-growing signifi

expressed on all sides where it was
pointed out that at tlrsi the opinion
prevailed that' the note itself was
merely a, "feeler" and that the ut

The .question much to the fore to
day was whether .the European neu-
trals . would present a united appeal.
The Spanish and Swiss representatives
here have been at the statedepart-ment-repeatedly
since those proposals
came out and probably know fully tVe
plans of this government. It is point
ed out that the European' neutrals
have suffered-beyond any other na
tions not actually involved in the
war and that peace is more essential
to them than to any "but the actual
belngerents. . In addition, they have
none of the bitterness of war and none
of its ambitions! and are anxious
more for the. coming of peace than
for the accomplishment of any other
purpose. , - ' . i '
Nevertheless, their geographical
position between the two contending
forces Ijas been so dangerous that
up to now they have been 'able to
do no more than maintain their neu
trality without mixing in the strug
gle, even to suggesting peace. . Part of
this danger is, however, thought re-,
moved by the American notes. - .
