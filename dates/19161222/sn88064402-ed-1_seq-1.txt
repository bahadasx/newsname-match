OUR PREDICTION TRUE
Not long ago when the stork paid
a few visits to Welsh homes, the
Journal made the prediction that the
haughty bird might be lingering in
the neighborhood, in fact we suggest
ev t:'t he might decide to winter in
this section. That the prediction was
true is proven by the arrival at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Ties. Miller
Monday afternoon of twins-- a nine
pound boy and an eight pound girl.
Taken as a whole this community can
not he accused of tending toward race
s'icide, but there are some instances,
painful to relate, where the stork
has neglected his duty, as shown by
the uneven distribution of favors.
Now, although the Journal feels no
personal responsibility in the matter,
it will undertake to persuade the stork
that in the future it is imperative that
he give a litle careful study to his
own vocation and bring a little cheer
(cherubs) to some of our cheerless
(cherubless) homes.
-Mr. John Robinson, who has been
visiting at the home of his daughter,
Mrs. O. C. Yantis, here in Welsh the
past three weeks, left Sunday morning
for Alexandria to visit his son Walter
for a few days. Mr. Robinson then
goes to Minnesota to visit several
weeks before returning to his home at
Brawley, California.
-Wm. M. Terry spent Sunday with
his family in Welsh.
-Demonstration Agent H. C. Fon
dren was in Welsh Monday.

DOMESTIC SCIENCE SCHOOLS TW(
MAKE STUDY OF RICE
Growing and widespread interest in Judo
the use and culture of rice, says the ii
Crowley Signal, is shown in a letter
received by J. R. Logan, an employe
of the Layne & Bowler Company in TI
this city, from Mrs. Sam Morthland was
of Decatur, Illinois, formerly a resi- ing
dent of Welsh, who states that the whet
schools of that city desire to take up ton
a study of the culture of rice. Dist
Mr. Logan has complied with the thee
request and sent the samples request- his
ed, and no doubt by this time the ceed
pupils in the domestic science depart- a c
ment of the Decatur schools are de- judj
voting themselves to a study of rice, witi
its culture, its milling processes and j1
its various uses as an article of diet. 1901
" When the schools of the land begin Nov
taking up the study of rice, particu- is I
larly in the domestic science depart- dist
ments, there is good evidence of the Clii
widespread interest in this cereal and but
of its growing popularity with the yea
people as a staple and permanent food bar
product. Much may be expected from ri
this study in the extension of the use sull
of rice in the homes of the land in
where now it is a stranger, and sim- wog
Silar studies in other schools should qui
be encouraged. the

My Dear Friend Reynolds: jui
I wonder if I dare ask you to do dui
l something for me? I would like for
. you to send me a stalk of rice (roots
Sand all) for Margaret to show in her W,
school work. She is taking domestic thi
science and the teacher is supposed to chi
know a little about the producing of
every article they cook. In the les
son today rice was the subject, and no fo
one but Margaret knew how it grew. pa

stalks,Ahat have not shattered off yet. th
If you can't then a handful of stems
pulled out of a tundle would answer, if
you could do At. I would like both the

be rolled tight to prevent the grains

TWO DiSi Ri&.T JUDGES
TAKE OA'ii OF OFFICE
Judge Winston Overton First Elected
in 1908-Judge J. D. Cline Suc.
ceeds Judge A. M. Barbe.
The Fifteenth judicial district court
was formally organized for the ensu
ing four years at Lake Charles Friday
when the judges-elect, Winston Over
ton and J. D. Cline, appeared before
District Clerk A. S. Gossett and took
theoath of office. Judge Overton is
his own successor and Judge Cline suec
ceeds Judge A. M. Barbe, who was not
a candidate for re-election. Both
judges were nominated and elected
without opposition.
Judge Overton was first elected in
1908, re-elected in 1912 and again in;
November last, without opposition. He -
is regarded as one of the strongest
district judges *in the state. Judge
Cline has had no official experience,
but has a record of ever twenty
years' successful practice at the local
Ibar.
The new judges will probably con
sult shortly and fix the terms of court
Iin the various parishes, dividing the
Swork between themselves. In point of
I quantity and importance of litigation
the Fifteenth, embracing Allen, Beau
" regard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jef
ferson Davis parishes is one of the
leading districts of the state, both
judges having full ten months' work
0 during the year.
