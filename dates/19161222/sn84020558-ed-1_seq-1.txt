NATION'S BLOOD

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON. Dec 21. There was fur
ther 'eliscussion 'of Germany's pea -e
i.lfir in :he house of commons to
nigt t. Sir John A. Simon on behalf
of himself and a group of followers,
gave unqualified support to Premier
l.loyd Ge-eirge's. speech in the house of
i einiinons. and Hastings Smith, L'bera!
member for Northampton, sounded a
new now urging that the German
proposals he allowed to see the light
if day. Andrew Ifonur Law, chan
cellor of the exchequer and member
of (he war council, promptly rose iti
behal: of the government and de
clare.! that if the tone of Mr. Smith's
spei-h ermeated the country, men
the blood and treasure which had
I (n. spent jp the war would have
been orient in vain.
"My understanding,'- aid Mr. Smith
in his address, "Is that the reply of
the nremier to the German note was
to the effect that ihe door was not
yel closed. That is a wis unswer,
and the best possible answer at this
stage. The German proposals should
le allowed to see the light of day.

pose, then the Gorman people v i 11

front wiiether provided we could ob
tain guarantees that our hnnnrabl
i. litigations would be fulfilled wo
sliould then make a serious effort to
get the parties together, then I am
certain such a proposition would be
tairicd by virtual unanimity.
"I am not prepared to face the
i rospects of a military decision which
means a war of attrition, unless I am
o minced there- is no other way out
I believe in the security scheme by
which the nations agree together, each
guarantee r 1 1 and all guarantee
each. An attempt to hold the central
. mitiios down by a militant tie. ision
followed by e-conomic strans'ilation
would mean earrving forward intf
peace all hostilities and hatreds, of
the var. It would divide E--oo i'-t
two I ostile camps and would make
war more inevitable and deaflly than
over and would fasten conscription
and milit.il ism forever rut all ni

Mr. ronar Law said:
"If the spirit of ihe f h to xliiit

Britain Is Startled and
Surprised at Wilson Note
Republican A. P. Leased Wire .
LONDON. Dec. 21. Absolute and
startling- surprise was the first feeling
in Great Britain aroused by President !
Wilson's note. The government was
surprised antl frankly admitted so.
The member.! of parliament were
en oall v surprised when the. news
spread through both houses during
the afternoon session.
The newspaper off.ces were sur
prised, and undoubtedly the public
will be equally surprised when they
read Ambassador Page's statement to
the foreign office in the morning
papere. All information from America
in the last few days, both in dis
patches from the usually best in-i
formed Washington correspondents'
and in ndvie-es to the banking and
business lirms, has said that the
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. Dec. 21. President
Wilson's note to the belligerents urging
discussion of peace was -officially inter
preted today as not bearing any threat
that the United States might be forced
to enter the war because of the con
tinued invasion of its rights by the
warring powers on both sides.
This interpretation was made late
today by Secretary Lansing in a formal
statement issued to overtake what was
characterizeel as widespread miscon
structions plai'ed on one given out
earlier in the day saying that because
of the increasingly critical position of
the United States as a neutral it was
entitled to know exactly what each bel
ligerent seeks in order that it might
regulate its conduct for the future.
Secretary Lansing's final statement,
formally prepared and issued after he
had been called to the White House
for a conference with President Wilson,
declared that he had not intended to
intimate that the United States was
considering any change in its policy of
neutrality and that the whole tone and
language of the note were sufficient to
indicate its purpose without further
comment on his part.
Mr. Lansing's first statement, made
orally and of which no official copy
was distributed, led to exaggerations
of its language and purpose throughout
official Washington. Its most striking
phrases upon w hich the widest specula
tion was based was that the United
states was "drawing nearer the verge
of war" and that the sending of the
note "will indicate the possibility of
our being forced into the war," and
that neither he nor President Wilson
regarded the note "as a peace note."
Secretary Lansing's first statement
was as follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the
note were as follows:
"It is not out material interest we
had in mind when the note was sent
but more and more our own rights are
becoming involved by the belligerents
on both sides, so that the situation is
becoming increasingly critical.
"In addition to that, we are drawing
nearer the verge of war ourselves antl
therefore we are entitled to know ex
actly what each belligerent seeks in
order that we may regulate our con
duct in the future.
"No nation has been sounded. No
consideration of the German overtures
or of the speech of Lloyd George was
taken into account in the formulation
of the document. The only thing the
overtures did was to delay it a few
days. It vas not decided to send it
until Monday. Of course, the difficul
ties that face the president were that
it might be construed as a movement
toward peace and in aid of the German
overtures. "He specifically denies that
that was the fact in the document
itself."' - - -
Secretary Lansing further said:
"The sending of this note will indi
cate the possibility of our being forced
into the war. That possibility ought to
serve as a restraining and sobering
force safeguarding American rights. It
may also serve to force an earlier con
clusion of the war. Neither the presi
dent nor myself regard this note as a
peace note: it is merely an effort to
i get the belligerents to define the end
lor which they are fighting."
When word of what the secretary of
state had said spread throughout the
capital it created the greatest conster
nation in official circles and among
the foreign diplomats, many of whom
were calling at the state department
to receive their copies of the note dis
patched to their capitals.
It became apparent that the secre
tary's statement was not fully approved
at the White House and that there was
a eiuestion as to the wisdom of making
nj comment mat might be regarded
as an addition to the note. The White
House was concerned lest any word
reach the foreign capitals to be con
strued as indicating that the American
note was anything but what it indi
cated on its face. So. after n nnfcr.
ence between President Wilson and
ionising, tne second state
I ment was formally prepared and dis
Itr buted at the state department. It
follows:
I "1 Vv.-o 1 .1 i

tone and language of the note to the

further comment on my part. It is
needless to say that I am unreservedly
in support of that purpose and hope to
see it accepted."
I At the White House no comment
whatever was made on the note itself
(Continued on Page Two)
presiden' had no intertion of taklr..
any steps toward peace or making
any move in European affairs. When
he transmitted Germany's note to
Great Britain without comment, it was
assumed that this action represented
his general attitude toward the Euro
pe" n situation.
Most of the newspapers commented
upon this course with satisfaction
The tenor of their comments tomor
rows will be that Premier Llovtl
Gorge's srteech and the speeches of
the Russia, French and Italian states
men have affirmed the entente allies'
position and that unless the German
government gives notice of the na
ture of the proposals which it would
bring to a conference, the allies can
not accept the invitation to sit around
an F.urcpean council table for a dis
cussion of ,ts terms.
CONGRESS ILL
CONSIDER fLSN
FOR TRAINING
rFtepobMcan A. P. Lensert Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. A definite
plan for universal military training
will be laid before congress next month
in the shape of a bill formulated by
the general staff of the army, accom
panied by complete estimates of cost
as compared with the voluntary sys
tem. Major General Hugh L. Scott,
chief of staff, told the house military
committee today that the work was in
progress and would require about a
month to complete. Chairman Dent
said the committee would be glad to
see the. bill.
In response to a laughing eiuestion
as to who would introduce it in the
house, Representative Kabn of Cali
fornia sard:
"I would be glad to have the honor
to introduce it."
General Scott was subjected to sharp
cross-examination today em his reiter
ated expression of l.-mversal measure
based in part on the voluntary system
as shown in the mobilization of the
National Guard for border service.
1'ive of the twenty-two members of the
committee took occasion to assure
their belief in the theory of universal
rervice, while two emphatically de
clared against such a system. Those
favoring vere Representatives Kahn.
Greene of Vermont and Tilsem of Con
necticut, republicans ; antl Olney of
Massachusetts, and Farley of New
York, democrats; while those opposed
were Representatives McKellar of
Tennessee and Representative tjuinn,
of Mississippi, democrats.
"Many of the guardsmen who come
back from the border are in favor
of universal service," declared the chief
of staff.
"I agree with you," said Represent
ative Tilson, "that voluntary military
service is not an adequate system and
probably would break down in time of
war as it has done before. The na
tional guard system in particular is
economically unwise because of the
dual control etver the forces bv the
federal government and the state."
Taking up the report on the mobili
ration of the guard which General
Scott presented to support his ar
raignment of any volunnteer system,
Representative Tilson continued:
"But do you think it is finite fair to
the national guard?"
"In what respect?" asked Genera!
Scott.
"Don't you think. General, that in
view eif the enormously greater task
of the regular service as the agent
which conducted the mobilization, the
regular army fell down harder in
preparedness than the" national guard?" 1
"We make many criticisms of our
selves," General Scott said, adding
thai a report on the army as his share
in the! mobilization already had been
asked for and would be presented.
"TUflt is what I want to appear in
this ecord,- said Representative Til
son, "rbecause I want to show that no
set erf officers, no matter how well
trained, could make this national guard
system work."
Representative McKellar declared
he was "one American who does not
wish to follow the example eif Germanv
and France in raising and training
armies. When Representative Quinn
put a eiuestion to the witness on the
assumption that congress might pass
such a bill, Representative McKellar
interjected: 'You need not fear It
will not.' "
"It won't except over my vote," ad
ded Representative Quirn.
The probable nature of the' bill now
being drafted by a commute" f ,
general staff was not disclosed by
General Sceitt, who also refused to
estimate the cost of such a system,
except to uny that proportionately il
would be much less than the expense
of volunteer method of training troops.
It is known, however, th;it the pos
sibility of welding into the new pro
