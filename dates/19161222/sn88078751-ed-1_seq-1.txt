ACTION COMPLETE SURPRISE
Latest Event In the Rapidly Moving
World Events Toward Discussion of
Peace Not Permitted to Become
Known Until the Notes Were Well
On Their Way to the Warring and
Neutral Nations No Preliminary
Exchanges Had Been Made.
Washington, Doc. .21. President
Wilson lias appealed to all the bellig
erents to discuss terms -of peace.
Without actually proposing peace or
ofterins; mediation the president Una
tent formal notes to the governments
of nil the warring nations suggesting
that "an early occasion be sought to
call out from the nations now at war
such an avowal of their respective
views as to the terms upon which the t
war wight be concludod and the ar
rangements which would be deemed
satisfactory as a guarantee against
Its renewal or the kindling . of any
similar conflict in tho future, as
'would make it possible frankly to
compare them."
"Wholly without notice and entirely
ontrary to what administration offi
cials have described as his course,
the president dispatched the notes to
ah the bolligersnts and to all the neu
trals for their Information. Summar
Ued 'in the president's own words, as
contained in the notes, his attitude is
as follows:
"Th president Is Tiot proposing
pace; he Is not even offering media
tion. Ho Is merely proposing that
soundings bo taken In 'order that we
may :earn. tho neutral -nations with
the belligerents, how near the haven
of pence may bo for which all man
kind longs with an intense and In
creasing longing. He believos that
the spirit in which he speaks and tho
objects which ho seeks will be under
tood by all concerned, and he con
fidently hopes for a response which
will bring a new light Into the affairs
of the world.
This latest development In the rpji
ldly moving world events toward a
fllscussion of peace was not permitted
to become Inown until the notes
were on their way to the American
KTObnssTiors in the belligerent enpi-
tals, and probably already in tho
hands of some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to
all official Washington, which had
been led to believe that with tho for
anal transmittal of the proposals of
fee central powers the officers of the
"Halted States would await further
moves hetween the belligerents them
selves, and that certainly, in view of
Hie speech of Premier Lloyd-George
and rhe announcements in Russia
?Yanre and Italy, further action by
-aeutralu would depend upon the next
refn! and delicate moves of the be!
Hgerenu. At the white houso no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
bother any of the powers even had
lntlmatod How they would receive the
noto, and there was every- indication
that the same careful secrecy which
prevented anything whatever becom
ing known about the president's ac
tion until it had been taken, would
surround any pf tho succeeding
moves,
British Embassy Surprised.
British embassy officials declared
th,oy verH utterly taken by surprise,
ivere wholly unable to explain it, and
were emphatic In their statement thnt
so exchanges whatever had passed
through the embassy' lioro as a
pro-
liminary.
The wish nnd hope of the German
powers that President Wilson would
ir-tnreeile in seine way has long been
wnll known and has !oen conveyed In
different ways to the whlto house.
The attitude of the entente alllos as
oxpreased by thBir statesmen and
certainly until recently in official ad
ices to tlio American government,
has been that a peace ofTer by the
Tnlted State t would be considered
w most me next thing to unfriendly.
Ml that, however, was botore thj
rfrman allies of their own accord,
'. -ought forward their propouals for
'1'ioiiBsion of peace. Prosident Wil
tc-r iiiocTioaliy says In the notes ho
-oinewhnt embarrassed in malting
'' ' augueHlion at this particular time, I
' ccautif it iray now seem ,o have (
en prompted by a uesire to play a
' ii. in connection with tho recent
orturis o' (he central powers."
To the conlral rowers the- president
says his action was iu no way "suggested-'
by tho Teutonic proposals,
while to tho entento allies ho says his
note is "in no way associated with
thorn." To both sets of belligerents
he sajs he "would have delayed offpi
leg It until those overtures had been
answered but for the fact that It also
concerns the question of peace and
may thus be considered in connection
with other proposals which have the
same end In view."
Expects Consideration.
Diplomatists consider it incredible
that the president would bring for
ward such .a proposal at such a time
unless he had reason to believe 11
would receive respectful considera
tion at !hc hands of all the belUger
cnts and above all would not preju
dice the position of the United States
as a possible mediator.
Tho German embassy view consis
tently hopeful that piopoEale of tin.
central allies would lead to a dis
cussion of peace, was expressed In
this authorized statement by Count
Bernstorff, the German ambassador.
"Now," said he, "I am perfectly
convinced that there will be a con
ferenre."
The nearest parallel In world his
tory for President Wilson's action
was President Roosevelt's move in
J 005 to end the war between HuesU
and Jp.pan. But in that'rase the pres
ident had been assured his proposal
would v.ot be disagreeable to either
of the belligerents and curiously
enough it was through Emperor Wil
liam of Germany th.it the prelimin
ary soundings chryr.tallzed Into thfs
Higgestlon that President Hoosevelt
take tho steps.
Officials expert the note to be re-
pived with general favor in Germany
hut many believe the real test will
come with Its arrival In the entente
countries, where many official per
sons have feared and sought to pre
vent any American intervention uutll
the military situation changed. From
the fact, however, that Lloyd-George'd
roply to central powers was milder
than generally had been expected and
ftill left the way open for further ne
gotiations, it Is believed that the al
lies will meet the present note In at
least a friendly spirit

POULTRY SHOW
FEATURED D
STATE EXHIBIT
Exhibits Are Flowing In Be
yond Most Ambitious
Expectations
RED FOXES ATTRACT
ATTENTION OF ALL
Golden Pheasants Mistaken
For Poll-Parrots By A
Small Lad
The poultry show, which is locate J
in the rooms of the Ideal Painting A:
Decorating company on East Ohio
avenue, is now in full sway and is ex
citing intense interest among those
who caro for poultry, prize or other
wise. Not only is the show consid
erably larger, but it also has a great
many rabbits and, last but not least,
the state exhibit which is dralug
large crowds constantly to witness
and observe the natures of the foxes,
skunks, wild ducks and other ani
mals with whose habits they are not
acquainted.
This year the officials of the show
were very fortunate in .being able to
obtain a building in which a certain
amount of'"wafnith can bo preserved
and not having to resort to the tent
of last year where a number of the
fowls on exhibit were nearly frozen
and. as a result, were not active
enough for the patrons of the poultry
show to inspect them thoroughly. In
the building which was obtained this
year, the regular poultry show is lo
cated on the ground floor, while the
state exhibit Is housed in the second
story.
Although the weather is rather un
favorable to the exhibitors, great
progress has been made in receiving
the fowls from different parts of the
county. There are a number of en
tries not in yet which will be here in
the near future. In fact, the number
of birds received by Clyde L. Brent
linger, secretary of the poultry asso
ciation, by Monday afternoon had
reached the entire number of entries
of the previous year's exhibit In ad
dition to the greater number of ex
hibits, there are considerably more
entries in the form of rabbits and
pigeons than last year, making the
show of a more versatile nature.
The state exhibit has attracted the
attention of a great many people and
has been a great drawing card for
tho poultry show. It is moved from
one poultry show to another, as they
come in order at the different cities
of Ohio, and Is sent out under the
auspices of tho state fish and game
commission.
So far, tho red foxes in this exhibit
have attracted the attention of th
majority ot visitors to the show, as
thoy are not plentiful through this
part of tho county any more. Here
the people have a chance to observe
the actions and habits of the foxes
and become more fully acquainted
with them.
Probably next, as regards the in
terest of the public, are the golden
pheasants, beautiful birds of a rare
species. While In Zanesville, a small
chap, attracted by their brilliant plum
age, pressed his face against the wire
surrounding the pen and said in an
inviting voice: "Polly want a crack
er?" Besides these creatures of nature
are: mallard ducks, ring-nock pheas
ants, siher pheasants, fox squirrels,
raccoons and skunks. All have gath
ered a goodly number of spectators to
tho show and have helped it to a
wonderful extent In admissions.
Charles McClave of Now London,
prominent poultry judge, arrived horo
Tuesday at noon and immediately af
ter dinner started' judging the fowls,
with many poultry fanciers from all"
over tbe county wondering if . they
would nne the prize fowls of th
show
So far the poultry show has been
a success, and If there ia the degree
of interest In tho show of next year
as compared with the heightening of
tho Interest In this year's show over
that of last year, Mt Vernon will cer
tainly be noted for Its poultry shown
and as a result more Interest will bo
shown throughout Knox county in the
raising of chickens.
FISH AND GAME NIGHT
Tomorrow evening will bo "fish and
game" night at tho show and many
members of the local association are
planning to visit tho rooms where
many attractive chickens are being
displayed. The exhibit of the state
fish and game commission Is com
manding their attention especially.

On account ot the late date at
which a start was made to organize
a union ovangelistlc campaign in Mt.
Vernon this winter, the combined
ministers and laymen's committee.
meeting at the Y. M. C. A. Monday
eenlng, decided that the plan would
have to bo abandoned.
The only definite action taken at
Monday night's meeting was the plac
ing in the hands of the ministers the
responsibility and power of working
out a campaign for this winter. In all
probability, this will rest finally with
individual churches.
It was the concensus of opinion at
the meeting that the evangelistic
proposition had not been launched
soon enough to make the prepara
tions, necessarily extensive, for such
a series of meetings.
Evangelists are in demand all dur
ing the winter season and It Is nec
essary to bid early for their services.
Rather than abandon the idea of
evangelistic meetings entirely, the
ministerial association was instruct
ed to assume charge ot the matter
and work it out, each in his own
church.

URGES SIMPLIFYING
STATUTES OF OHIO
Turner Advocates New System
For Enacting Legislation.
Columbus, Dec. 21. "Make Ohio.
laws readable by use of short, simply
worded sentences" was tho recom
mendation made by Attorney General
Turner In discussing "Necessary
Changes in Ohio Statutes" before the
midwinter meeting of the Ohio Bar
association. Rather than recommend
ing wholesale changes in the laws.
Turner advocated a new system in.
enacting legislation.
"What we need most is a develop
ment of the science of law drafting,"
the attorney general said. "Thla.
course should be in the curlculum of
BTcry law school." He said that laws,
now aro but "partial legislation,"'
lacking "clearness of expression" and
being "obscure of purpose."
Among the specific changes In tho
statutes Turner recommends that
a definite schedule of fees should be
established for appeal cases under
the workmen's compensation act.
He also urged that laws b?.
passed providing for all the machln-.
ery necessary for state road ofllclals
to secure the aid of federal funds in
road building
Lamentation over the trend of
the times to "commission govern
ment'' and the subsequent decline of
the Judiciary was voiced by Curtis E.
McBrlde of Mansfield. "Commissions
and boards, Into whose hands the exe
cutlon of our government is swiftly
drifting, have executive, legislative
and judicial powor In almost unlimit
ed quantities," McBride said. In Ohio,
he cited the state tax commission, thc
ntllltles commission, the board ot
elections, the board of health and
other powerful bodies.
"Without a hearing men can be
deprived of their liberty on the sus
picion of a contagious disease
Buildings can he destroyed, busi
ness controlled, rates fixed and othet-'
arbltrarr legislation enforced," Jfe-.
Bride said In citing instances of the
