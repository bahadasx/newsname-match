CONDEMNS
ATTACK ON
MERIT IDEA
By Fred Shoemaker
CITY CDNTROLIiKIi
In reply to a number of in
quiries regarding the inten
tion of the proposed salary
Ordinance wltli reference to
civil service I wish to make
It perfectly clear that the or
dinance is a deliberate at-
tempt to kill tlie merit sys
tem in tlie city hull.
There ls no question of economy
Involved. At present the civil
service board is allowed a secre
tary at $100 a month and a stenog
rapher at $15 a month.
The proposed ordinance in
creases the salary of the stenogra
pher to $45 and decreases the sal
ary of the clerk to $45 a net de
crease of $25 a month, or $300 a
year.
Not another salary in the city
hall ls decreased, and other sal
aries are actually raised more
than the amount of the decrease
in the civil service office.
Of Vital Inleresl
As a matter of fat. the civil
service board has saved the city
thousands of dollarß by making
Impossible the appointment of in
competent political favorites.
There is a constant pressure on
the part of the council to break
down civil service, on the plea of
efficiency, or economy, or some
thing equally false.
These attempts are simply the
expression of a desire to reward
personal friends or political
cliques at the expense of the tax-
payers.
This is a matter of vital interest
to the entire city.
At the last election the people
♦oted three to one to strengthen
the civil service provisions of the
charter.
Now. eight months after that
vote, the council Is trying to block
the will of the people by making
It impossible for the civil service
board to operate effectively.
Two Can lilock Scheme
This city government ls owned
by the people of tbe whole city,
and the commissioners are simply
agents of the people employed to
run the city as the people wish it
run. The people have emphatical
ly instructed their commissioners
to follow the principles of modern
civil service. The commissioners
are proving false to their instruc
tions, and the people should awak
en to that fact.
There Is nothing more con
temptible in public life than
to see a candidate get up .mil
pledge the voters to support
the merit system, and then
when he is in office, either
knife civil service, or refuse
to lift h finger to protect it
from Its enemies.
Four votes are necessary
to pass a salary ordinance,
therefore, two members of
tlie council can block this
scheme If they wish to do so.
PETTIT TO FIGHT
SALARY SLASHING
Members of the Municipal Civil
Service league, composed of 300
city employes, will meet in the
council chambers Friday evening
to discuss the proposed ousting
from city work of J. S. Ellsworth,
secretary of the civil service
board. The council Is contemplat
ing a reduction of Ellsworth's sal
ary to $45, in order to force him
to resign.
Commissioner Pettit declared
Friday that he would not stand
for the cut.
"I have always upheld civil
service," he said. "And the peo
ple have Indicated that they want
it improved rather than Injured."
Judge Writes

Put at least one candle in

from the basement to the

Christinas night, to celebrate
the "Feast of Candles" pro
claimed for Tacoina by Mayor

There has been some question
as to just how the ancient custom
ehould be followed. Some persons
have had the idea that only a sin
gle candle ehould be lit in a house
to proclaim the Yuletide.
Senator Ralph Metcalf, who
suggested the idee, for Tacoma,
explained today how the custom is
followed ln some of the eastern
cities. Here's tbe way to do it:

CITY COUNCIL
IS IN WRONG!
Messrs. Fawcett, Pettit, Gronen, Atkins and Drake, city council
men, you are IN WRONG. Back up.
The people of this city have instructed you very plainly, by i-liar
ter provision and referendum, to maintain an efficient, modern civil
service system.
At present they have such a system, for the first time. Tliey
Want it extended and developed.
Instead, you are trying, by the mean, because underhand meth
od of cutting off the civil service department's already pitiful! y
small revenue, to break doAvn that system. You cannot defend your
course on the ground of economy, as Controller Shoemaker has shown
very clearly.
If the council or any of its members have a personal fight on in
dividuals in the civil service office let tliem settle that fight man-to
nian, and not by undermining a policy of government the people have
determined.
It is a very plain case, as it stands, of Old Style Politics vs. Ef

This was the summing up of
the scathing argument of U. S.
Attorney Clay Allen in the fa

morning.
Attorney Welsh of South Bend
came to his feet two or three
times during the speech with pro

Another statement that got a
rise out of Welsh was that the
defense "did" not call some of
the defendants to the stand."
"You have no right to say that
to the jury, and you know it,"
cried Welsh. The court sustain
ed the objection.
Argument for tlie defense was
begun by Ar-R. Titlow just before
the noon recess.
"This is the first time," said
he, "that 1 have ever known an
attorney for the government to

The audiouce, in which were
many of the witnesses whose
truthfulness Allen attacked sar
castically, sat tensely listening.
Mrs. Ross and one of her sons
were also among the hearers. In

of the defendants, donned an ear
trumpet, in order to hear better.
It now appears certain the case
will go to the Jury Friday after
noon or evening.
75 Witnesses
Seventy-five witnesses have
been examined during the trial.
The defense rested its case Thurs
day afternoon, without calling all
the defendants to the stand. Lit
tle testimony was introduced in
rebuttal.
"J. N. Howard and his wife
have seven daughters and three
sons," Allen said, "and the North
River valley is a network of in
termarriages and relationships.
"Witnesses who have testified
in this case have had to be care
ful. They would be in danger if
they incurred the enmity of the
large and powerful Howard fam
ily."
"Howard cultivated the good
graces of county officials. The
valley wafe a remote little barony
of his, far removed from any court
of justice.
"Mrs. Ross came as a disturbing
factor into this situation, and
when she arrived, Howard, whose
daughter was a constant visitor at
the Vanderpool house and after
ward married Claude Vanderpool,
and the whole Howard family, de
cided to adjudicate the matter in
their own very primitive way.
