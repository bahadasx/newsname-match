Missouri Crop Report For 1916
. The contents of the" Santa ClaUs
stocking if the Missouri farmer are
this year valued at $231,888,951,
according to the annual crop re
port of the Missouii state board of
agriculture and which was made
public by W. L. Nelson, assistant
secretary. Monday,
'iGratifying as are these returns
which show values twelve and a
half million dollars in access of the
1915 figures," said Mr. Nelson,
"there is in them but little satis
faction for the farmer, In the
main, the figures represent paper
profit only, if, in fact, there is any
profit. With a corn crop almost
70,000,000 bushels, short of the
the 10-year average and with wheat
bu't little more than half a normal
harvest, there is scant surplus for
sale.
"While prices for farm produce
are high it is also true that the
cost of production due to de
creased acre yields and to the high
cost of living, which hits the farm
er just as it does everybody else
was never before so great. Were
it not for the somewhat higher
prices now prevailing prices which
in most instances do not cover the
n crea sed cost of production every
ipound of beef or pork, every pound
of butter, every quart of milk and
even every dozen of eggs sold
would represent a loss. In view
of the proposed boycotts on many
food products to dissatisfaction
due to lack of understanding or to
conditions for which the farmer is
in no way responsible and over
which he has no control there is
rrrr
their
breeding stock and curtail
operations generally. This they
may ao instead or engaging more
extensively in live stock farming,
dairying, poultry raising and
kindred activities. These are facts
worthy of the most thoughtful
consideration."
No Blade Next Week

years The Blade will not be issued

Laclede Patronage Appreciated
S. M. Strain, proprietor of the
big jewelry store at Brookfleld
expresses himself as much pleased
with his'patronage from Laclede,
it being as good as the best. He
says that the Laclede people seem
to realize that high grade goods do
not come at cheap prices and they
buy the best that he has.
The time is short and the
weather is cold so Mr. Strain says
his optical parlor is warm and at,
the disposal of out of town p'eople;
they can rest and use this parlor
as a waiting place.
The Blade knows that Mr.
Strain does all within his power to
please and satisfy and his reputa-.L.
