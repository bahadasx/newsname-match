UKLY RESSENT OF THIS CITY
BEV. C. H. BEAULIEU WBITES IN
TERESTINGLY OF THE LATE
PETER BOY
We reproduce below in part an ar
ticle taken from the White Earth
Tomahawk, and written by Bev. C. H.
Beaulieu, which will be interesting
to many of our readers wao still re
member the late Peter Boy. He was
a resident of Little Falls in the early
days, and passed away at this* place
many years ago, the amilv at the
time of his death, living in the build
ing later known as the Palace hotel.
In the early days Mr.-Boy conduct
ed at different times, The* Northern
Hotel, later known as the Vaaaly
House and later the Merchants Hotel
which was located where- the Bealty
block now stands and uie hotel later
known as The Palace, which was lo
cated on th site of E. A. Berg & Go.
Garage and Ferrell Plumbing shop.
John Boy, for many years chief-of
police of Little Falls, was a son of the
subject of the article, which reads as
follows:
Pierre, or Peter as I shall hereafter
call him since he i^ better known bv
the English form, must have betrayed
while young some yearning and apti
tude for learning, for he was the
only one of the family to my Jknowl
edge who acquired "book larnm'."
How, and where, I do not know,
but always within my ken hefwas a
leader and a writer. And within this
l^en is the- fact that while yet at La
Pointe he had become associated with
the United States agency as interpret
er and assistant otherwise.
This was due to his knowledge of
the English language and hi3 lability
to read and write.
Peter, however, spoke it well and
fluently, in fact it became to him
aside from the Chippewa thj (readier
language, for though he spoke French
it was with less fluency than the Eng
lish.
I have said that he became' better
known as Peter, but this statement
needs qualifications. In the Indian
country he was known both" as Pier
rish and Pienish, according as the
tongue speaking the name had the
French or the Chippewa twist.
The Chippewa tongue has no capa
city to sound the letter B, in words
containing this sound the nasal tone
comes into play, hence Pienish.
It will be observed here that the
Chippewa tried to follow the French
and that Pierish is only an effort at
Pienish.
To get back to Peter tie came to
Minnesota about 1850, perhaps ear
lier. When Chippewa annuity pay
ments began to be made in Minneso
ta (and this was before the treaty
of 1854), Peter became a local fixture
at the agency on the Crow Wing river
at- a point west of where ^ragnerd
now stands.
He belonged to the .agency staff* and
with him were associated Truman
Warren and later on Paul H. Beau
lieu as government farmer.
When the agency was established,
of course a blacksmith was necessary
and Agent Watrous brought with him
from La Pointe a Mr. Chonnard, who
had been government blacksmith
there.
Mr. Chonnard was possessed of an
interesting family, there were several
stalwart sons and two charming
daughters.
Peter looked upon the charms of
one and lost his heart to her but
gained hers, and in a short time Peter
Boy and Philomene Chonnard agreed
to summons the priest and then they
set up housekeeping.
A large group of sons and daughters
resulted from this marriage and at
this time are and have been associated
with White Earth, Minn., history.
Peter's descendants unto several
generations are living upon the reser
vation or near by,'and many scarcely
showing connection in physical appear
ance with the tribe with which tiiey
are politically joined.
Peter himself never came to the re
servation. After leaving the govern
ment service'he came to Crow Wing
and became- associated with a Mr.
Bailey as a partner in the firm of
Bailey & Co.
Mr. Bailey had iong been engaged
in trade with the Sioux of Minnesota
and desired to extend his business in
to the Chippewa country, and desir
ing a partner PeteT Boy was offered
an interest which he accepted and
thus became a merchant at Crow
Wing, and a trader throughout the
Minnesota Chippewa country. From
some cause or another the venture did
not prosper, so the business was clos
ed up and Mr. Boy removed to Little
Falls, Minn., where the Chonnards had
already taken residence.
There he engaged in the hotel busi
ness, one maintained, I believe until
his death.
While at Crow Wing he became in
terested in politics. As a democrat
he was elected to the house of repre
sentatives of the territory of Minne
sota.
I will not venture to be accurate,
but I will state in a general way that
Benton county extended from Sauk
Bapids northward to the boundary
line between this country and the
Hudson Bay territory. I suppose but
for the old royal grant to the Hudson
Bay Co., Uncle Sam when he had wig
gled out of the clutches of England,
would have claimed jurisdiction in
definitely towards the frozen waters
of the north, perhaps to the Pole and
a little way around on the other side.
Assuming this what a Vast territory
Mr. Boy would have represented at
the capital, St.. Paul.
His constitutents wonld not have
been many as regards voters, but
counting "Indians not taxed," and
those of animal, bird and fish life, Mr.
Bov did represent many and much.
It may be stated here that during
Mr. Boy's political career his constit
uents knew but one party, they had
heard vaguely of an oppojitionjMtrty

PINE TREE MANUFACTURING
COMPANY GIVES EMPLOYES
10 PER CENT INCREASE
In line with the action of many of
the large manufacturing concerns
throughout the country, the Pine Tree
Manufacturing company of this city
has announced that beginning with
January 1 all of its employes who are
paid by the day will receive a 10 per
cent increase in wages. The raise 'was
entirely voluntary by the eompanv and
comes as a pleasing surprise to the
men. It is made to jielp the men meet
the incf eased cost of living.
Approximately tiro hundred em
ployes will be affected by the increase
and it mil mean an increase in the
-amount of the monthly payroll of the
company of approximately $5,00.0.
WESTON, WANTED HERE FOB
FORGERY, Id SERVING TIME
Harley Weston, alias Oscar Carlson,
who is wanted by the authorities here
for forgery, is now serving time in
the St. Cloud reformatory for another
crime, according to Deputy Sheriff
Fueger, who visited that institution
Wednesday to identify the young man.
The charge held against Weston by
the local authorities is for forging a
check for about 0500. He purchaseu
an automobile from a party at Cush
ing and drew the check on a bank in
which he had no funds nor an account.
He brought the automobile to this city
and left it at a garage here for repairs.
He stayed at the West Hotel here and
Mr. Wagner, who was proprietor of
that hotel at that time, charges that
a quantity silverware and clothing dis
appeared from the hotel at the same
time that Weston did. He was reg
istered at the hotel as Oscar Carlson.
BASKETBALL GAME TONIGHT
ALUMNI AND HIGH WILL CLASH
AT HIGH SCHOOL GYM
NASIUM
Tonight, at the high sehool-gymna
sium, the high school basketball team
will play the alumni team in the first
game of the season. The game will
be called at 8:15.
Coach Liljedahl has been working
hard with the boys and he believes
that they will be able to cop the game
very handily. There are some very
fast players in the quint this year, in
cluding Captain Levin, Sims, Dobbyn,
Lloyd. Tanner,. former Bemidji star,
and Elvig. Other members of the first
squad who tnay be_j^ed are Grimes,
Holmes, Richard, jRnnen, Bastien,
Higby, Tourtillott, Malburn and
Blake.
The alumni lineup has not yet been
decided upon but the following are
likely to be seen in the fray: Joe
Tomeity, Richard Meyers, Lawrence
Longley, Dr. C. H. Longley, Wells
Graham, Verne Joslin, Howard Fer
rell.
SCHOOL VACATION STARTS TO
DAY
Sessions in the schools started at 8
o'clock this morning and the classes
will be dismissed at 12:30 this after
noon, for a two weeks' vacation dur
ing the holidays. Most oi the teach
ers go to their respective homes to
spend the vacation.
Miss Edith Martin of Minneapolis,
formerly of this city, is seriously ill
at a Mirneapolis hospital, according
to information received here.
Mrs. Carl Van Hercke of Parker
town was slightly injured yesterday
afternoon as the result of being
thrown from her rig in a runaway.
The accident occurred near the Brtad
way bridge. Mrs. Van Hercke was
rendered unconscious for a short time
and she sustained bruises about- the
head. She was taken to the home of
her brother-in-law, Peter Van Hercke,
of this city.
so of course Mr. Boy's victory can
hardly be called so, he was nominated
for the house and received every vote,
"which isn't saying mucn," for the
voters did not constitute an army.
But he represented the district well
and acceptably, so his descendants
have reason to cherish his political
career and esteem it fondly.
In our day we are disposed to hold
early legislation in but little esteem,
but the pioneers did well and laid
foundations firmly

the achieve-
ments of the community afterwards
becoming the state.
True there were "ways that were
dark and tricks that were vain," such!
for instance as that of Joe Bolette,
when he stole the capital bill. But
Joe and his friends were- only fighting
a righteous cause, and posterity should
be glad that the capital is St. Paul
and not St. Peter.
Mr. Boy helped make territory ana
state history and we who knew him
personally, and those who know him
by report may rejoice that a Chippewa
was prominently identified with the
history of the territory and thus in a
measure with the s*ate of Minnesota.
In his familv relations Mr. Boy was
all that could have been desired.
Outside and
sociallv
was
he was es­
teemed and regarded as a true friend.
Speaking personally from a long
and intimate acquaintanceship with
him, I can say that I never heard of
his doing anything to injure anyone,
he was always, the companionable
man, his laugh was pleasant to hear,
and it
contagions, for it was
hearty and genuine: and sufficiently
loud.
Peter Boy is remembered well and
affectionately by all who knew him,
whether as Peter or Pierrish, or
Pienish.
In his day society was crude, but
Peter Boy was one the^few who
rose above the level, then thinking we
may look fcact and say, "well done."!

$6,000,000 WIL£ BB DISTRIBUTED
AMONG EMPLOYES OF BELL
TELEPHONE SYSTEM
Employes of the Northwestern Tel
ephone company here are anticipating
a delightful Christmas, as the head of
the company has given out, according
to a dispatch from New York, that
employes having been with them over
a year will receive a gift amounting
to three weeks' salary and those hav
ing worked for the company over
three months and less than a year
will receive a sum amounting to two
weeks' salary.
Telegraph employes of the company,
it is expected, will also be remember
ed.
The following dispatch from New
York tells the story:
An extra cash payment exceeding
$6,000,000 will be distributed to cer
tain classes of employes in the com
panies comprising the" Ball Telephone
system to aid them in meeting the
present abnormal living conditions, it
was announced here by Theodore N.
Vail, president of the American Tele
graph and Telephone company. The
payments, it was stated, will be equiv
alent to two Or three weeks' salary, in
proportion to length of service. A
statement issued by Mr. Vail said in
part:
"Employes who have been in the
service for over one year and who are
receiving $3,000 or "less a year, will
receive the equivalent of three weeks'
pay, while those of the same class who
have been in the service for over three
months, but less than one year, will
receive the equivalent of two weeks'
pay. Employes receiving over $3,000
and less than $5,000 will also partici
pate in the payment, but not in the
same proportion, as those receiving
the lesser rate of pay.
"This is not intended to be a distri
bution of profits, nor do all employes
participate. It is intended to help
those employes whose margin between
income and necessities is narrow.''
Mrs. B. Davidson of McGregor ar
rived Tuesday morning for a few days'
visit at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Axel Johnson. This is the first time
they had seen each other for twenty
three years, being old acquaintances
at Hinckley, where tney became sepa
rated by the great fire which destroyed
that town.
B. B. Millard has been busy the
past few days .getting subscriptions
to the Jefferson Highway Declara
tion. He has been meeting with
great success and indications are that
the number of subscriptions from
Morrison county will far exceed what
the association officials expect. The
magazine, which is issued monthly,
sells for $1 for three years.
The decision comes after litigation
lasting more than two years in the
courts. Mr. Kropp, as one of the bid
ders for the contract of building the
new church for St. Nicholas parish,
was $3,900 below the nearest competi
tor. His certified check for $1,000 was
submitted with the bid.
Afterward Mr. Kroop notified the
church that he had made a mistake
in his figures, his estimate being less
than he had intended. His bid had
had been $30,973. He offered to set
tle for $2,000 more.
The church in the meantime had
made other plans and declined to ac
cept the offer of Mr. Kropp. It was
brought into the courts by the con
tractor who asked that his certified
check be returned to him. During the
first trial the jury disagreed.
It was brought up again and the
court submitted three quesuons for
the jury to decide. When the jury
had decided these the court found in
favor of the church.
The case was taken on appeal to
the supreme court. In a lengthy de
cision the supreme court finds that
when "an honest mistake is made"
the contractor is allowed damages.
The attorney representing lae church
may ask for re-argument of the case
before the supreme court. He will
ask that a new trial be granted in or
der that several points may be brought
out.
MUNICIPAL COURT
John Camppangle, an employe at
the Farrow livery, was arrested Tues
day on a charge of occupying the same
Toom in a 'local hotel with a young
girl. The arrest was made under a
city ordinance recently passed which
makes it unlawful for unmarried men
and women to occupy the same room
in any hotel or tavern. He was
brought up for trial yesterday after
noon at 4 o'clock and found not guilty
by Judge Lyon. The judge urged that
someone see to it that the girl be taken
care of and. he afterward gave her a
stern lecture.
The municipal court turned over to
the city treasury for the months of
October and November $70, and to the
county treasury $170 for the same
months. This. money was from fines
collected.
