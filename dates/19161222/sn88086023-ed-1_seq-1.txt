Dear Grover;
Just a few lines to let you know
that I am still alive and kicking. Hope
you are alright. Well, old boy, how
are you getting along? It seems ages
since I heard from you. I have done
fine since I left. Had lots of excite
ment, etc., but managed to struggle
through with Just a few slight wounds
which only amounted to a short spell
In the hospital, which of course, was
very welcome. I was over In England
on a ten days' furlough last month
and I sure had a swell time. I
thought I would make the best of It In
case I happened to get a put-me-to-sleep.
One of them does not seare u'
now. We have had nine months of
11 and are well used to a little noise.

BERLIN, Dec. 22. The German
public is determined to continue fight
