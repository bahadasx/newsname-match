DAN LANDS A GOOD JOB
Dan Murphy, faithful , Democrat,
(ood fellow and. until recently head
barber at the. Cnambei'lain ftWal'
barber shop in this city, has resigned
his job of amputating whiskers and
will hereafter be connected with the
Loyal Order of Moose in an official
capacity. ' He has been appointed Na
tional district . director of the order
for this state and will establish head
quarters at Topeka, His business
Will be to start new lodges where the
order Is not yet represented, and iron
out the difficulties of the lodges now
running should any ever arise during
his term of office. Dan was elected
dictator of the local lodge when it
was organized, and we understand he
has filled the position with dignity
and grace. Ha Is a prince among
men and a hard worker for the up
building of the Moose, hence the
high moguls of the institution used
mighty good judgment when they
picked him for the job. His first job
will be at Garden City, where he
hopes to build up a banner lodge as
a starter.
. The past year has been the most successful
, in our business life, and we take this
1 means of thanking our friends for ;
their corporation and pa-
trpnage in making it so.
. - Kindly accept our
' : r best wishes
