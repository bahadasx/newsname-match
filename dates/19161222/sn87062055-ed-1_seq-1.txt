It is with deep regret and some
chagrin mainly "grin," that we note
that our contemporary has at last
sold the court house and grounds to
the city of Flagstaff and purchased
grounds in tho Babbitt addition for
the new court house. While we have
felt this condition coming for a long
time, tho people have been in hopes
that it could be put off until they
were informed of it and could prepare
themselves for the' extra expense, but
now tho blow has fallen and we pre
sume that it Is up to the people of
the county to conduct themselves ac
cordingly.
There were but few people in the
county who fully realize who owned
tho county until they were informed
by the Leader and there can be no
question as ta.the truth of their state
ment as it undoubtedly came straight
from headquarters to them.
There is a strong argument in favor
of the project: "It would be a most
conspicuous mark for the town, as the
situation would attract attention from
the trains and at a great distance."
There is no question but that tho
town has been a "conspicuous mark"
for a good many years, but engineers
have been able to stop their trains
hero for years without being able to
first see the court house.
There is ono feature of the trans
action that docs not appear clear: If
tho court house is sold to the city, and
a new court house built up in the Bab.
bitt addition, the city council might
bo idiotic enough to sell the old city
hall to some one who would go into
business there.

ELTON ENSIGN HALE 4
DIES AT PHOENIX
Elton Ensign Hale, the gifted
pianist, passed away last week at
Phoenix after a short illness. He was
well known in Flagstaff where he
spent the past two summers giving
piano lessons, and has many friends
here who will regret to learn of his
sudden death.
He was twenty-eight years of age
and went to Phoenix about three
years ago from Jamestown, N. Y.
The Phoenix Republican in speaking
of his death says:
"The news of his death will be re
ceived with great sorrow by the
music-loving public as well as the
legion of personal friends of the young
musician. It was only a fortnight
ago that he gave his last lesson in
his studio in the Chamber of Com
merce and .it was thought that he
would soon be able to resume the
prominent place he occupied in local
musical circles. His death came as
a great shock to all."

noon and evening at he formal open
ing of the drug company's new home,

"00 THE SHOPPERS EARLY"
PEOPLE WONDERING WHY?
'Do your Christmas shopping ear
ly," "fix up your packages so-and-so,"
and a thousand other instructions are
given the dear people who have the
money to spend and who have to
spend it as per instructions and who
get little or no service at all.
The postoffkc will be so crowded
that you won't get any service. Why ?
Because the great government of the
nitcd States, supported by the peo
ple's money, will not take the pains
to see that there is sufficient help and
means of handling the goods.
The great express companies of the
United States want your money now
and they will do the best they can to
give you service ns soon as they get
ready. They know the rush Js coming,
and they make full preparations for
taking your money but forget to pro
vide the help to handle the goods you
want sent out. Why? Because the
people of the United States stand for
it.
Freight and passenger traffic dit
to. Who gets the benefit of all the hust
le and bustle of the holiday trade?
The people? Nix. The tradesmen,
express .companies, postoffices and
freight haulers.
Why shouldn't there be enough help
and equipment to handle it?
The people pay their good money,
why shouldn't they get some reason
able service?
There is only one answer in most
cases they want to hog it alLand are
too durncd stingy and onery to hire
enough help to handle the business
that they know is coming, and would
rather whine at the public because
they won't throw their money In at
the door and go on about their busi
ness.
The constant annual "yowl" about
doing your shopping early is no more
than a full admission that the differ
ent concerns are incompetent; they
arc too stingy to pay for extra help
they need to handle the business but
want the public to pay them for it
just the same. They don't want to
lose or divide any of the profits, but
feel that it is cheaper to bunc the
public.
If you happen in a place where the
poor "shop" girls arc overworked and
do not have time to wait- on you, go
to some place where they hire enough
help to properly conduct their busi
ness. This little combination of junk may
not only contain a union idea, but a
slight modicum of food for thought
for a corporation, many of which be
lieve that they can do as the great
government does give the people
what they please when yiey have
time and inclination to do so.
The people generally are rapidly
coming to the conclusion that the gov
ernment as well as the great corpora1
tions can play square and deliver the
goods if they wish to do so, and they
are beginning to want to know why
they do not
METEOR FALLS NEAR WILLIAMS
Monday night, at about seven-thirty
o'clock, the heavens to the south
west of us were lighted for quite a
few seconds by the falling, of what
appeared to be a large meteor. Many
remarked that it was the brightest
they had ever witnessed. Ranchers
southwest of town claim that it fell
somewhere in the vicinity of Mr.
Parker's ranch. Upon coming in con
tact with the earth, there was an ex
plosion equal to a heavy charge of

HUNTS CONTEST QUASHED BY JUDGE
' STANFORD-WILL TRY NEW TACTICS
Judge Stanford Monday morning at
10 o'clock granted the motion to
quash the contest of Hunt for the
office of governor, nnd stated it was
the duty of Sidney P. Qsborn to issue
a certificate; that it should have been
done and that the case was thrown
out because it had not been issued.
Ives made application for a superse
deas bond in an endeavor to have the
inspection proceed.
Judge Stanford ruled that as he
was without jurisdiction he could not
give contestant tho right to continue
to inspect the ballots. Campbell's at
torneys having courteously waived the
immediate filing of the bond, Ives
tried to take advantage of their cour-
tesy by claiming his appeal was per-
fected and that the case was in the
hands of the Superior court; that
therefore, Stanford could not stop
what he had already started and that
the inspection must go on. Judge
Stanford ruled against him, where-
upon Ives asked until Tuesday at 11
o'clock to file a writ of prohibition Campbell are not looking at the mat

REAL CHRISTMAS STORY
. One time a good many years
ago there was a little boy with
only one pair of pants, but his
I folks did not whip him often, so
he did not care. He was a poor
boy and did not even own the
house he lived in. There was a
mortgage of $800,000 on the
miserable hovel in which he lived &
and his father did not know which !
way to turn he had a stiff neck.
! The poor little fellow used to
lay awako nights w ondering how !
he could get the 8 put on the last
end of the mortgage figures.
He was a good little boy and had
eyes just like that , so you can !
see that he could see both the
high and the low side of things
that many other little boys could
not sec. He thought at first that
he would get some rats and have
them eat up the mortgage and
then give the rats to his mother,
but he remembered that his
mother did not favor rats much,
so had to give up that plan.
But in those years a boy grew
older and older day by day.
Also in them days, the high
cost of living was funnel end up.
Without a word of warning,
the mortgage grew every day(
As is usual with mortgages, in
stories, they are due, also dew,
the day before Christmas, which
should be the happiest day of all -
the year. This mortgage was an
exception; it was due when the
last wail of the clock sounded
at twelve the day before Christ-
mas, when all should be happi-
h ness and packages and packages
of all kinds.
5 Papa and mama were in the
front parlor trying their best to
keep their fingers out of each
other's hair, because they loved $
5 each other so, and were wonder- "5

to save the old homestead, when
in rushes little Willie with love

fornia match.

The old home should be saved.

other's necks. '

cision.
The program for tomorow is this:
Counsel E, S. Ives for Governor Hunt,
as a move made necessary by the ded
cision of Judge Stanford to throw the
contest out of court, will bring suit to
enjoin Secretary of State Osborn from
issuing a certificate of election to
Thomas E. Campbell. The attorney
general will demur to that suit, act
ing as a-State official for the State
official vho Is made the subject of the
injunction proceedings.
Unofficially, but on good authority,
it is stated that the demurrer will be
sustained. Senator Ives will then ap
peal direct to the Supreme court,
which it is understood, will lay aside
all other business in order to act on
this matter.
According to Jones there fs a good
chance to get the contest out of the
trenches by Christmas or at least by
New Year's.
While Jones is making protcsta-
tions of being fair, the friends of
cd move tomorrow, Jones will act for
Osborn, secretary of State, who ever
since he canvassed the vote, has upon
ing favorable to thef governor, and
shutting out from participation the
parties most vitally interested, the at-
torney3 for Governor-elect Campbell.
Of course Ives and Jones, both being
Hunt men, could enter into almost
any kind of an agreement regarding
the case, and it docs not look to the
ordinary layman that such an agree
ment would protect or be fair to the
interests of Campbell. The latter has
been elected governor, the inspection
of ballots has made no change in the
official result, and to a man "up a
tree" it looks as though the latest
legal move was designed to keep Hunt
nn the office from which the voters
' ousted him last November.
SANTA CLAUS HAS A
SPECIAL AGENT HERE
Owing to the lack of co-opera-
tion and a sufficiently early start
to get the Municipal Christmas '
tree on the road to success, the
Elks, other lodges and other so-
cictics will not have one this
year, but notwithstanding this
fact, and the fact that Santa
Claus lost a lot of names and '
addresses last year in jumping
over the Grand Canyon, he would !
like to have them gathered up
for him this year again in Flag-
staff. Dr. E. S. Miller, whose
whiskers are not quite as grey as
Santa's, has been appointed spe-
cial agent for young and old to
sorter attend to things here-
abouts, and if you don't happen
to see him, you can leave word at
The Sun office as to just what the
trouble is and who is troubled.
The older folks may under-
stand this a little better than the
young folks, because there is a
real Santa Claus nnd he not only
wants the little folks to know it, J
but wants the old folks to help
him show it.
Santa Claus has always been
good to Flagstaff and he is
mighty well acquainted with Dr.
Miller, and if there is a little !
heart aching or a little heart
breaking, (or, big and old) he
wants the address, and while
The Sun boss is old, sour and
cross, if you don't know where
to find Doc. turn the idea in at
The Sun office and we'll see that
the old Santa agent gets it.

MANY RANCHERS LOSE PART
OF THEIR POTATO CROP
JMany ranchers in this section of the
country lost a goodly portion of their
potato crop this year by the late
rains, which came so late that they
were unable to get them out of the
ground before freezing weather
caught them.
R. W. Watson, who had a fine crop
near Bellemont, was one of the un
fortunate ones and lost many a sack
of good potatoes on this account Wil
liard Sevier, who has a ranch near
Williams, was another loser. A num
ber of the ranchers in the Cliff coun
try were crippled some by the same
causes. In some cases help could not
be secured and a good slice of the
crop was offered for help to get it in
before cold weather caught them, but
help was not available.

DRY FARMER PROVES
fflUOF DRY LANDS
While there are many arguments
as to whether or not dry farming can
be made to pay in this section of the
country, it docs seem that it is a good
deal up to the special location as well
as the farmer who handles the ground.
Elijah Lay came in from the south
bringing with him samples of good
big, solid ears of rorn that were rais
ed in the little park known as "Chim
ney Flat" by Frank Thompason.
He also had samples of as fine pink
beans as can be raised anywhere in
the country, raised on the same land
by dry farming. Mr. Thompson dis
posed of 3,000 pounds of beans at
seven cents per pound delivered at his
ranch to the purchaser. There were
other successful crops, including two
crops of Sudan grass that reached'
tho height of 5b feet before either
crop was cut.
It is claimed by ranchers and others
living in that section of the country
near the east rim of Oak Creek, that
there are hundreds of acres of equally
productive land which could be suc-
essfuly used for dry farming pur
poses, if they were allowed to home
stead it, but for some reason, it has
been difficult to gpt it classified as
farming land.
TURN BOY AROUND WITH WIRE

WANT A NEW FIRE WHISTLE
The regular fire laddies seem to
feel that a new fire whistle would be
of groaj advantage to all concerned, if
they could get one. It is suggested
by those who do the regular fireman's
stunts, without pay and because they
believe that fires do not pay, believe!
that a new electric fire whistle would
be just about, the right thing to oust
them out of bed at any old hour of
the night and direct them to the scene
of trouble.
There is such a new contraption that
will blow off at the touch of an elec
tric button without the necessity of
passing the word along the line, and
it could be installed at the price of
$300 or there abouts if the people of
the city feel that it is worth that
much money for that much additional
protection. Aside from the regular
truck driver there are no regular fire
men, the rest of the boys are made
up of the fellows that are willing to
put in their time and clothes, in help
ing thc other fcllpw out when he gets
into trouble with a fire that threatens
to clean him out of house or business.
A few liberal donations among those
who have property to save would help
them along in getting the necessary
alarm apparatus.
Residence Burns at Pinedale
Thc large residence of W. A. Thom
as at Pinedale was totally destroyed
by fire Thursday night of last week.
The fire started from a defective
chimney and was not discovered until
about 11 o'clock at night, after the
family had retired. Nothing was
saved excepting a piano. The loss on

three and four thousand dollars.
There was no insurance. Holbrook

HOLDEN CONTESTS
BARING'S ELECTION
Fred Holden has filed a contest
against Fred Garing for the office of
supervisor through his attorney,"
Francis D. Crable, with Superior
Clerk Adams.
Holden was the democratic candi
date and on the face of the first re
turns, not including the Saginaw
Camp 10 votes which were thrown out
temporarily, the vote between Garing
and Holden stood, Garing 945, Holden
909, giving Garing a majority of 46
votes. When the attorney general
gave orders for the Camp 10 votes to
be counted, it was found that Holden
received 25 votes and Garing 14 at '
that camp. This reduced Garing's
lead over Holden to 25 votes.
Mr. Holden's grounds for a contest
are stated as follows:
First: On account of illegal voting.
Second: For the reason that by
errors in counting ballots cast at said
election, the person declared elected
the said Fred Garing, did not in fact
receive the highest number of votes
or a greater number of votes than the
contestant who was a candidate for
the same office; andwas not in fact
elected: that' the contestant received
a higher number of votes at said elec
tion than said Fred Garing and w as in
fact elected to said office of super
visor. Third: For the reason of malcon
duct on the part of all election boards
and members thereof in all of the
precincts of the said county of Coco
nino, state of Arizona, and on the
part of the board of canvassers and
all members thereof."
The required bond was filed with
Wr A. Campbell and Harry Hibben as
securities and it is probable that the
contest will come up as soorf as the
Coconino ballots are brought back
from Phoenix where they were order;

SKATING FINE AT LAKE .MARY
Skating on Lake Mary will be one
of the sports of the winter season if
there is not too much snow to make
travel out to the lake too bad. Last
Sunday the lake was one glaring sheet
of ice -nnd many people fond of the
most hcaltful exercises were out there
having a good time. Lake Mary is
bound to be a most valuable adjunct
to Flagstaff both summer and winter.
Heretofore there were a few small
pounds near the city where skaters
could go and the sport rather lost po
pular favor for years.
(VETERAN WOOL BROKER HERE
Mr. R. J. Salter, the veteran Boston
Wool broker, was in .Flagstaff Mon
day, having just arrived from the east
to look over the Arizona wool situ
ation in the interest of his firm. Mr.
Salter is very optimistic as to the
condition of the wool market of the
east and believes that highest known
prices will prevail this season. The
demand will greatly exceed the sup
ply. He is advising all wool growers
to consign their wool this year and is
certain of quick sales since the 61d
stock of. wool is completely cleaned
out of the big warehouses.

C. B. Wilson, county attorney of

E. Greer in the prosecution of Fay

and Jones & Jones and A. S. Gibbons
are the attorneys for the defendant.

since Wednesday, but it is expected
that it will b'e finished this evening
and go to the jury. St Johns Ob

The dance which the Elks planned
on giving Christmas night has been
called off on account of it being impos

The "Saturday night Jitney Dances

will be able to secure a building in
which to give the New Years dance
as planned and a definite 'announce
