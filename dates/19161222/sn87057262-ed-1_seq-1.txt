WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.—Congress

in his attempt to find a common

for a lasting peace.
Both houses today refused to en

The senate for the second time to-1

In the house Representative Bailey
moved that that body go on record as

resolution was referred to the foreign
affairs committee.
In the senate Hitchcock offered a
substitute to his resolution of yester
day. The substitute reads:
Resolved that ihe senate approves
and strongly endorses the action
taken by the president in sending
diplomatic notes of December 18 to
the nations now engaged in war, sug-
gesting and recommending that thnss
nations state the terms upon which
peace might properly be discussed.''
Hitchcock said he introduced the
substitute because his first resolution

"It would be a reflection upon the

Thirty-five Children Carried Out and
All Inmates Accounted for
Excepting One Aged
Man.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WICHITA, Kansas, Dec. 22.—All
but one of the ninety-two inmates of
the Kansas Masonic home, which
burned here this morning had been
accounted for at nine a. m. today.
An aged Mason by the name of Deck,
who recently crme to the home, had
not been accounted for at that time.
Thirty-five of the inmates of the
home were children, Mason orphans.
These were all carried to safety soon
after the flre was discovered in the
basement. The rest of the inmates
were men and women, aged Kansas
Masons and their wives. The flre
started in the basement of the build
ing, probably from the furnace. Be
cause of frozen water plugs, firemen
could do nothing toward saving the
building, a 1300,000 structure, the
only Masonic home in Kansas and the
finest west of the Mississippi river.
Five Missing.
WICHITA, Kansas, Dec. 22.—Short

tour 5 waitress of the
Kansas Masonic borne, which burned
here this morning with1 a loss of $300,
000, were missing. At 9 o'clock it
was believed all had been accounted
for but Joseph Dock, an aged inmate.
Deck has been found uninjured. It is
not known whether the live missing
were burned in the building or wheth
er tney were rescued by neighbors,
and their whereabouts is as yet un
known.
Two bodies, one of a man burned
beyond recognition, and the otn.-1*
believed to be a woman, were taken
from the ruins of the Masonic home
here at noon. The fire is under con
trol. The destruction of records and
the fact that the persons rescued
were taken to numerous residences in
West Wichita, make it difficult to ac
count for the residents at the home,
but at noon lure today it was still
believed that r.r.ly five were missing.
The missing are Mr. and Mrs. Jesse
Brown, an aged couple: Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Ferris, formerly* of Atchisori,
Kans., and Gertrude Wegle of Bur
den, Kans., a waitress. Mr. and Mrs.
Brown and Mr. and Mrs. Ferris had

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.—Recover
