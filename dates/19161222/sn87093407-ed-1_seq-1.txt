ALLIES WON'T REJECT WILSON'S NOTE
THIS IS THE WORD
OF ENTENTE
DIPLOMATS
INU.S.
% W ASHINGTON'. Lkv. 22
For the same reasons that
tireat Britain and her allies;
did nut flatly reject the peace
proposals i>t the Teutonic
powers, they will not flatly
turn down the suggestions
made by President Wilson in
his peace messages, was the
belief of some en
tente diplomats here today.
This opinion was voiced to
a United Tress correspondent
in intimate and confidential
at two of the most im
portant entente embassies in
Washington.
At th*»« rmbMnlei two rmnM
were Ktven for the above opinion
"To show offldtllr and formsl
lr" any reeret o*er the president's
peace suggestions by fUtlr refus
ing Ms request for specific term*
wo>»ld be playing dtrectly Into Or
niaav's plans, since OertnMy then
would have opportunity to relter
[ate oft renea'ed pro tint tat lons that
'the entente allies are responsible
for prolonging the war.
Such a flat turndown would tend
to weaken whst »>ny>athy there
now Is In' th» C. S. for the en'ente
allied cause
The«e allied diplomats did not
hesitate to admit "chagrin'' over
the president's suggestion that
specification of war objective* Is
nere«sary Th-y said allied speak
ers have i>een specifying their ob
jectives for two and a half years.

WEATHER STORMS
WASHINGTON. Dcc. 22
— Recovering slowly from the
dizzy whirl of yesterday's his
tory making developments,
government officials and for
eign diplomats here today
looked to the foreign offices
of the belligerent nations for
the next peace moves.
As outlined in early report*,
strong exception was at first
taken to President \\ ilson's
overtures in both English and
Canadian press. This out
spoken exception seemingly
today has been toned down,
the move now being called
merely "inopportune." The at
titude of allied displomats
here aNo shows a trend in the
same direction.
The administration bellevp., how
ever. this feeling In not sufficient
to rant any real gloom over the sit
nation.
Wilton Confident

KILL IT!
IT'S ONLY A
RATTLESNAKE!
SBFa rattlesnake showed
™ its head, you would
not hesitate a minute.
You'd kill it without com
punction to save yourself.
Today—and tomorrow—you
have a chance to kill a political
rattlesnake.
You have the opportunity to
annihilate the party system
that thrives on treachery, de
ception, buncombe, artificial is
sues, prejudice and CROOKED
NESS.
The opportunity is yours by signing
Nonpartisanship Initiative Bill No. 2H.
Kvcry political crook is against non
partisanship. Fvcry "handpicker," every
cheap, peanut politician and grafter is
fighting it. because it substitutes MHRII for
the falsity of the PARTY LABKL.
Yet no question of importance has ever
been settled on a party basis.
Even slavery was abolished by non
partisan indorsement of democrats as well
as republicans in the Xorth. The republi
can party platform of IH6O, upon which
Abraham Lincoln was elected. DID .\OI
demand abolition.
The gpreat questions of today—war, peace,
universal training, preparedness, high cost of liv
ing—are they party questions? GOD FORBID!
Is there any party issue in this state? Is it
the mothers' pension, prohibition, the first aid, our
educational institutions? Is it our road construc
tion program? There is not a single party ques
tion in this state or county.
SeattU, Tacoma, Spokane, and many other
cities in this state and in the nation have abolished
partisanship in city elections. We have also abol
ished it in the election of our judges. Why not
extend this principle of nonpartisanship to county
and state elections? Initiative Hill No. 2K pro
poses that.
To make the campaign successful, 40,000
signatures are needed. Only 25,000 have been
secured so far. There are only two days left. A
whirlwind finish is necessary.
FIVE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS ARE
NEEDED! Get a petition at Nonpartisan head
quarters, 3107 Arcade building, sign it, and circu
late it for more signatures.
Partisanship is the rattlesnake in our
body politics, sucking at its life blood. It
serves no useful purpose. It supports spoils,
and graft, and crookedness. Kill it without
mercy.

REINSTATED AFTER
HE SOLVES BOTHELL
BANK HOLD-UP CASE
Bis bJ Hagen, suspended patrolman, won rein
statement and became the hero of the police department
Thursday for his single-handed apprehension of the gang
of bank robbers who held up the Bothell state bank and
operated around Seattle for ! months, according to
the confession of one of the men arrested.
The five bandits were rounded up in less than 12
hours after Hagen had worked night and day on the
case since the Bothell robbery, December 6.
The men arretted were
P. J. Dunky. 36. shlngleweaver

mile* north of Kverett.

tip from a *tool pigeon the day after
the Itothell robbery.
"A fellow, whose name I can't

i been asked to join th. bandits In
.the Bothell bank robbery.
Tries "Bhaks<lown" Ruse
"For two weeks I worked on him,
'trying to get the names, lint he
held out. I tried every scheme I
! could think of.
Finally I said to him. 'Ghe me
| the names and I Can shake down
the robbers and split with you.' He
agreed, and told me that old man
j Bounds, who bad just bought a
blacksmith shop near Auburn, was
ringleader."
This gave Hagen the lead he
wanted, and he went to Auburn
and worked three da>s checking
up on Bounds, who he learned had
paid $4!>o for the shop to (*. ('.
Parks December 13. and paid $110,
a year's rent. In advance.
Thursday afternoon Hagen went
into the blacksmith shop.
Rounds Shows Alarm
"I bad fixed It up with the stool
pigeon who gave me the first tip

) said. "He came In and whispered
Into Bounds' ear, 'The police are
! looking for you.'
"Bounds got excited and said,
' (So to my room and bring me a
lilack satchel that's there, with my
gun in It.'" Thfn Hagen stepped
lup and arrested Bounds. It sur
-1 prised the stoolplgcon as much as
I it did the old fellow.
Ilagen's ordinal Informer left
: the plare in a hurry.
After going to Bounds' room and
getting the band bag. which con
tained a mono) belt and $70. be
sides the automatic pistol, Ilagen
brought his prisoner to Seattle
IKillce headquarters at 7 p. in.
Woe for Young Wife
' I bad learned, too, that voting

"Alas for Tiny Tim, lie bore a little crutch, and had

stool. Hob lu-ld his withered little hand in his, as if lie
loved the child and wished to keep him by his side, and
dreaded that he might be taken from him.
"'Spirit.' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never
felt before, 'tell me it Tiny Tim will live.'
Poor Tin) lim ! Tens of thousands have caught at
their throats as they read these lines about Tiny Tim.
No one could invoke such tremendous human interest in
In-- characters as Charles Dickens, the famous Knglish
novelist. Tiny Tim is one of the characters in Dickens'
"Christmas I arol," the greatest Christinas story in Eng
lish literature.

that there are $100 rewards out for
conviction of each of the robbers
and an additional $1,000 reward
from the Ronton bank.
