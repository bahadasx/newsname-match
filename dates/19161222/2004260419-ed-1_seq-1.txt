A delay In receiving necessary ma
chinery has caused a postponement o(
the launching of the motor vessel
Allurd. According to Information re
celved, the vassol will be rer.dy to
take her Initial dip some time about
January 15.
Tho steamer Colllo left out Satur
day, bound for Sun Pedro via Sun

and she carried 28 passengers. She
was detained several hours on ac

The City of Portland, which left
Newcastle some days ago, returned
to that port In order to get ballast,

made so that the vessel could obtain
n cargo of coal, and at this time she

Many of the stock ralers in the

ployed attorneys to teut the validity
of the stock law passed at the recent
election. Some of the attorneys in
terested In the case claim the law
will be held unconstitutional as muny

The Mibt learns that sincojtlio elec
tion quite a number of cattle have
been shipped out of tho Nehalem val
ley and stock raisers in other por
tions of tho county are disposing of

son, Frank Dealer, Harold Deeker,
Lester Lake, Bob Dixon, Caly Stan
wood, Albert Faxon, Dewey Smith,
William Perry, Kenneth Howell, John
Southard, . Harry Wilson, George
Walker.
Last Friday morning the talks
given by the four boys, each repre
senting his grade, wero excellent. One
of Dewey Smith's otatemonts wrs es
pecially Interesting to the Junior
girls. , Ho said the main reason he
proferred being a Junior was because
-ill tho prettiest "girls were in' his
;l&88. Dewey is a veritable hero
Long may he live! ,
Tho program for next Friday
morning Is as follows: Piano solo
'hyllis Brown; reading, Grace How-
all ; vocal solo, Helen White; original
'hristmas story, Marian Baker.
Well, this Is the last week before
the Christmas vacation. And those
iwful exams! It sasnis to most of
us thnt the fuculty would only be
doing the proper thing by waiting
until the excitement of Christinas I
past.
Marian Baker, our clever Junior
has been busy the last few dr.ys in
preparing the Initial copy of her
latest attempt at Journalism, "The
Columbia Herald S. H. H. S. Edi
tion." The circulation Is limited and
copies cannot bo readily procured
Marian wanted to keep her paper a
secret but It was discovered by some
if the faculty, who treated 1 as a
good joke."
At last tho conservative football
boys have accumulated sufficient
courage to announce a pr.rty In!. honor
of the high school airls Friday eve.
ning at the high school. The girls
are anticipating the time of their
Uvea. . .?
Waa everyone subscribed for the
S. H. H. S. News? If not, then see
xbout It at once. If you haven't any
Interest In the high school now, may-
be you will have some day, or maybe
you wore In high school once, your
self. If you wore, didn't you want
all your attempts to be successful
Oh, thank you; you knew you would
subscribe all tho time.
A number of cases of tonsilitls have
developed in tho past week, causing
many pupils to be absent from school
Last week there was such commo
tlon among the boys while In the
reading room thut somo of our wise
and keen Sophs are not permitted to-
leavl their Roats during -.tho fourth
period in tho afternoon.
The latest scheme of tho faculty
for getting better results (rom the
students is to seat us according to
our grades. We wonder what they
do If we all get E's next month.
After a game battle of five weeks'
against ovsrwhelming odds and suf
fering intensely all the while, Reu
ben Sten finally gavo up tho battle,
and Sunday morning, at 11 o'clock, i
surrounded by his der ones, he
passed away ut St. Vincent's hospital
In Portland. . It was just five weeks
to the day since the young man was
iken to tho hospital sulTcrine with
an aggravated caso of appendicitis.
After the operation complications set
in, and though all in the power of
medical science w?.s done, even to
tho transfusion of blood from his
father's veins to givo further
trength, all efforts wero In vain.
At the time of his death his father,
John" Sten, and his mother wero at
hla bedside, as was his brother Flav-
us, who arrived from Montana only
few hours before his brother
passed away. Tho young man, real
izing that the end was near, sent
greetings to all of his friends in St.
lelens and gave comforting assur-
nces to the loved ones with him.

ng, and the Interment was in the
)dd Fellows cemetery near Warren

and the manner In which the pro
gram was carried out showed that the
youngsters had been carefully
trained. The High School Gleo Club
was a feature, and it responded to
an encore as did the school quartet

ST. HELENS POST-
OFFICE IS BEE HIVE
Covernment Employes Work Hard
on Heavy Christmas Business. ',-, ,
For the past several days the goat..
office has been the most popular,.
place In St. Helens. Each mail brings
In many sacks of Christmas packages
and mall and those who live in St.
Helens are remembering their dis
tant friends, (or the mall auto is
loaded to the guards' each trip. Mrs.
Dodd ; states that at this date the
volume of Business done is about 50
per cent more than : last year, and
with 'two days more to go the busl-
hess.of the office will probably make
a great recprd.
One thing Is noticeable this year
at the postoffice, which is that a ma- i
Jority of the packages are insured.
This gives the postal authorities a
check on them and guarantees the.
sender against loss should the pack-' -
age fall to arrive at its destination.
The Insurance Cost Is very small and,
as stated, Is a g.reat protection to the
sender of the article ' ' ' ?
For the convenience of the public,
the postmaster announces that the
office will remain open until 8 o'clock
tonight and Saturday night. The
Sunday hours will be from 10 to 11
a. m. Bear this In mind-, so If y'o'u"
want to mall any- parcels or TBcelW"
them, be at the pos toffee at the time
designated. .
