Little Child
Horribly Burned
Clothes Ignited while Plaving
Around Stove.
Arlene Gee, the five-year old daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Gee who
reside near the West Side School house
was badly if not fatally burned while
playing around the kitchen stove Thurs
day morning about seven o'clock.
Mrs. Gee had been burning some
papers, and left the child in the room
wnile she went out into the . yard to feed
some chickens. The little girl evident
ly tried to imitate her mother and the
burning paper ignited her clothing.
The upper part of her back and right
side was badly burned before her
mother could extinguish the blaze. Dr.
Parks was immediately summoned and
administered all the aid he could to
relieve the little sufferer. It will
probably be a day or so before the
extent of the injuries are really known.
POTATO GROWERS
SHOULD ORGANIZE
Scheme to Improve the In
dustry in Charlevoix County.
Charlevoix county has the right soil
and climatic conditions for successful
potato production. This section of
Michigan is also better located with
respect to markets than the famous
potato growing regions of Maine $nd
Colorado. With our good soil, favorable
climate, and easy marketing advantages
there is needed only united effort on
the part of the growers to put Charle
voix county in the same class with
Aroostook county, Maine, known the
world over for its potato crop. An
organization o( growers would also
pave the way for a marketing company
or produce exchange, and thus with
the production and marketing of the
crop handled according to the best
known methods, the growers of our
county would prosper whether the crop
was big or small or the price high or
low.
The following outline is the form of
constitution for growers' associations
which has been worked out by the
secretary of the state potato growers'
association. The six objects of the as
sociation as set forth in the constitu
tion are well worth careful considera
tion. This proposition ought to appeal
strongly to all potato growers. To make
sure, however, that there is sufficient
interest to warrant calling a meeting
for the purpose of organization and the
election of officers, every person who
will agree to take part in such a move
ment is requested to send a post card
bffore Jan. 1 to H. L. Barnum, Ironton,
who will set a date and place of meet
ing, also arrange to have the secretary
of the state association present to assist
in the organization.

From Our Boys
On Borderland
Good Grub, Plenty of Drilling,
And Plans for Xmas.
Camp Cotton, El Paso, Texas,
Dec. 15, 1916.
The people of East Jordan who are
interested in the boys of Company I
may wonder when they will be sent
home. But to rhe boys on the border
there is no' question for no one really
expects to see home again before next
spring, i nat tins is more man a sur
mise is proven by statements sent from
Division Headquarters to the Michigan
Troops warning them to be prepared
for at least seven months more border
service. If Company I sees East Jor
dan again by next June every one may
consider themselves lucky. From time
to time Michigan papers print sob
stories about the hard life of the men
on the border but there is no truth
whatever in those reports. In Co. 1
most of the men are away from home
for the first time and add to that the
fact that the average age of the men is
only twenty two one may expect a few
home sick stories to leak out.
Good food is one hobby in the army
and the visitors at Camp Ferris who
sat on the ground to eat their "slum
gullion" would be much surprised at
the change. Here is the Thanksgiving
Menu cooked and served by Cooks
Jack Mahar and "Billum" LaValley,
Oyster stew to begin with then seven
big turkeys stuffed with dressing; the
kind mother used to make; following
that came mashed potatoes with brown
gravy, cranberry sauce, fruit salad,
coffee, tea, and to finish pumpkin and
cranberry pie and chocolate cake
After the meal those who could still
yell gave three hearty cheers, for the
Cocks, the Mess Sergeant 'Ditt' Patter
son and the Officers. Then to settle
their dinner the men who wanted to
climbed into motor trucks for a ten
mile ride to the school of mines where
the 33rd Inf. met the 20th in a game of
football. Of course that is not a sample
of every day. But on the whole the
men are better fed by far than at Gray
ling. Sunday there is always pie and
generally chicken may be found on the
bill of fare. And all of this is done on
thirty cents for each man, for that is all
the government allows.
The first part of December a Review
of the 11th Division was held at Fort
Bliss. Nearly twelve thousand troops
passed before the Commanding Officer
Gen. George Bell on that occasion.
Among the units passing before the
stand were nearly four hundred auto
mobile trucks, any number of wagons
driven four abreast each with its four
mules and the driver or skinner as he
is called, one Regiment of Artillery
with its thousand men and horses, a
like number of cavalry, many machine
gun companies with their armored cars
and Fords or Flivvers as they are called
and with each unit appeared a band.
The entire parade extended ten miles
and when one thinks that these were
only one fifth of the soldiers in El Paso
he may get an idea how thick they real
ly are.
It is the plan to make this Division
one that can be moved on wheels. Such
a thing has never been done in the U.
S. Army so it will be quite a distinction
for the troops in the command.
Toin onlooker a drill now on the
border is more than tnteresting. Every
morning the men march four miles to
the Mesa or Desert and drill until noon
To a Michigander the sand, cactus and
sage brush was at first a decided
novelty but now the only interest in
the scenery is shown by dodging cac
tus needles or chasing rabbits. On one
day the Ohio and Michigan troops each
armed with blank ammunition were
pitted against each other in a sham
battle. Ten thousand men charging
each other on an open field furnishes a
sight worth seeing. Even to see Leiut.
Spring lead a charge up a sand hill is
worth something.
Xmas week th6 soldiers get a seven
days vacation. And now every man in
the Company from the Captain down is
planning a great time. Every man in
M Company received as a present from
the people of the Soo a laundry bag
with at least a dozen useful articles in
it. This with the news that the people
of El Paso are going to give each man
a piece of pie and cake makes the holi
day seem very near. And after payday
on the 15th of Dec. when each man re
ceives his few gold coinsthe money will
go first not for a good time but 'for
presents to send the folks at home.
And East Jordan will have two Xmas
trees this year one on the corner near
the Post Office and the other in the
Mess Hall of Company I two hundred
yards from the Mexican Border.
Farmers'
Institutes
Dates and Places of the One
Day Institutes for Charlevoix
County.
The one-day farmers' institutes for
Charlevoix County will be held during
the first week in January. Mr. R. D.
Bailey of Gaylord will be the state
speaker. Among other things Mr.
Bailey will discuss soil problems, farm
fertilizers, alfalfa, bacterial life in the
soil, potato culture, dairying, farm ac
counts, farm management and the ap
plication of science in modern farming.
Mr. Bailey is a very pleasing speaker
and all who attend the meetings will
enjoy his practical and interesting
talks.
The local managers at the various
places are planning for some small but
interesting exhibits of farm produce.
It is expected that these exhibits will
serve to start discussions and give the
institutes a more practical turn. Farm
ers are invited to bring small samples
of corn, potatoes, grain, etc.
The dates, places of meeting, and
local managers us follows:
Jan. 2, Barnard Grange Hall, James
Willis.

The county round-up institute will be
held at Deer Lake Grange Hall, but the
date has not been announced.
A ROSY FUTURE
FOR GOOD ROADS
Van Pelt sends us the following clip
ping from the Chicago Tribune, show
ing plainly that his plan for Charlevoix
County, using our own share of the
$75,000,000, appropriated by Congress
for building good roads throughout the
United States, is the right and proper
thing to do, instead of going ahead and
spending it without utilizing our part
of the appropriation.
"A rosy future for good roads
throughout the United States as a re
sult of the passage of the federal land
aid bill was predicted at Hotel Sherman
yesterday by speakers who addressed
the third annual session of the north
western road congress. The new law
brings the building of state trunk lines
to a point that meets the wants of state
traffic, said F. A. Cannon, executive
secretary of the Wisconsin Good Roads
Ass'n. 'Its whole spirit will result in
each state planning a comprehensive
highway system, built and operated
under state supervision and construct
ed with federal funds.
Joe L. Long, of Moline, IIl.r secretary
of the congress, told his hearers the
hardest job he knew of was convincing
city dwellers that good roads are as
vital a matter to them as to the farmers.
Automobilists want good roads, of
course, he said, but that phase of the
question is the merest trifle. As a
matter of fact, the Chicago laboring
man is the highest taxed person in
Illinois, simply because bad roads make
his food products cost more.
Eight times more tonnage is suppos
ed to go over our roads than over the
railroads. When bad roads handicap
the farmer and make him pay railroad
fare, prices go up.
Much of the interest at the evening
session centered in an illustrated de
scription of the work of a manufactur
ing concern which makes a specialty of
'good roads trucks' and their operation
in road building."
Surely, some one in Charlevoix
County ought to be sufficiently inter
ested in saving themselves some money
and, especially so, when we all know
that our present system is simply a
Very foolish expenditure of money and
the unkeep of these roads means a lot
of money out of every taxpayers pock
et. Why not now get together and build
a good cement road on our West Michi-
j gan Pike and Dixie Highway from
j Antrim County to Emmett County the
I entire length? This is the time to do it
before the portion assigned the State of
; Michigan by the United States Govern
1 ment is all gone. Somebody is surely
going to get it and it is up to you work
ers to get it now.

One trouble with reform is that every
man wants to apply it to the other fellow.

Charlevoix County
Needs Our
Undivided Loyalty
Loyalty to one's country is a natural
inborne duty. That should need no
defence. We have three cities in our
county, each one governed by a mayor
and councilmen, who all have civic
pride, civic duty and civic patriotism.
At least, unless such be the case, they
should not represent the people. The
man who looks upon our cities and
county as simply a place in - which to
live and to make money is not worthy
the name of citizen, unless he is will
ing to spend a portion of his gains for
the betterment and enrichment of the
county. Every man in our county
should not only be a real citizen, but
he, too, should be an asset. The future
reputation of our county depends en
tirely upon the loyalty and the course
which we adopt, as citizens, in our
business towards each other and to
tourists.
We want a Charlevoix County spirit.
We grow good fruit. Stamp the boxes
the fruit is packed in "Grown in Char
levoix County," and then see that every
apple is worthy the wrapper (bearing
the same stamp.) .
We have great possibilities in Char
levoix County. New bills are to be
introduced into the legislature this
winter in order to distribute the Feder
al Roads money. Under this plan, the
federal government will pay fifty per
cent, the state fifteen per cent and the
'county thirty-five per cent, of the total
cost of construction, which may be
called National value. This means the
West Michigan Pike from Miami, Fla.,
to Mackinaw City, and if the state pays
the sum of 13,500.00 additional on this
road, which it is safe to say it will, just
see what a very small sum it would
cost our county to build this sixteen
foot concrete road. It can be built a
good deal cheaper no, I mean it will

WILL MONEY TAKE ROOT?
If you want to see how money will
take root and grow Just go to the
Peoples State Savings Bank and 'plant'
a dime in the new Christmas B nking
Club they just opened to accommodate
the people of this community who want
to start to save money.
This dime will grow in fifty weeks
before Christmas next year when you
will feel the need of ready money into
$127.50.
You only need to "water" the dime
you plant regularly every week for
forty-nine more weeks. The way you
do this is to put in twenty cents the
second week, thirty cents the third
week and so on, increasing your de
posit only a dime each week.
The little Christmas Banking Club
book which the Peoples State Savings
Bank will give you or any of your
friends free will show you when to
make your weekly deposit and how
much you put in in order to get, in fifty
weeks, the $127.50.
Whole families are joining this
Christmas Banking Club. It's the best
thing that ever struck town to show us
all how to really save money and get
ahead. It gets us into the banking habit
the best habit anyone can learn.
Money planted in the bank will surely
grow if we let stay in the bank what we
put in, and keep on adding to it.
'Every little bit added to what yoa've
got makes a little bit more."
First thing you know, if you only
START to banking your money, you
will become rich.

weeks have $63.75. You must put in
ten cents the second week, fifteen cents

the amount you deposit only a nickla
each week. The biggest sum you put
in at one time is only $2.50. You will
hardly believe this until you look into
the little Christmas Banking Club book
which the Peoples State Savings Bank
will furnish you and every member of
your family free.
The "kiddies" can join the one-cent
or the two-cent club and in fifty week
have $12.75 or $25.50.
Every boy and girl and man and wo
man in our community should join this
Christmas Banking Club. It's a good

The Potato Crop a Mortgage
Lifter in Western Michigan.
The average debt of mortgaged farms
in the entire state, increased in the 20
years, from 1890 to 1900, from $890 to
$1,107, or 24.4 per cent, while the aver
age value of such farms rose from $2,
748 to $3,654, or 33 per cent Thus the
owners' equity increased from $1,858 to
$2,547, or 37.1 per cent Aa a result of
the greater relative increase in farm
value than in farm debt, the mortgage
indebtedness, which was 32.4 per cent
of the value of the mortgaged farms in
1890, had decreased to 30.1 ptr cent of
that value in 1910.
The returns from the potato crop this
season in many Western Michigan
counties, has enabled a large number
of farmers to pay off and reduce their
mortgages, so that, according to a re,
cent estimate, the mortgage indebted
ness has been further decreased about
10 per cent, making the mortgage in
debtedness on these farms at the pres
ent time only 20 per cent of the value
of the mortgaged farms, which 1st
splendid showing.
