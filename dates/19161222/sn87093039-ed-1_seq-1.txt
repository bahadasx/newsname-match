WORK ON LEAVENWORTH
TERMINAL IMPROVEMENT
Will Begin Shortly—l 2 Sidings Mile Long
—12 New Round House Stalls—24
Foot Subway Under Track
The information that extensive im
provements in the Great Noithern ter
minal buildings and yards would be
made was given out and the fact print
ed in The Echo two months ago, but
not until this week has any one in
Leavenworth seen the plans and blue
prints, or was it ever before given out
when the work would begin. This
week local railrjad meu had a sight of
the plans and were also told that work
on the improvement would begin short
ly after the holidays.
The most pleasing and important
feature of the contemplated improve
ment is the fact that a subway 24 feet
wide will be put in about 300 feet
west of the water tank, where the
track crosses a deep gulch. Sixteen
foot is reserved for vehicle traffic and
eight foot for pedestrians. This im
provement will be constructed in a
most substantial manner of concrete
and stone. The present round house
which has fourteen engine stalls will
be reconstructed and an addition of
twelve stalls built. The new eneine
stalls will not be built in the circular
form but will follow square lines,
which leads some of the railroad men
to suspect that the new stalls are in
tended for electric motors after the
Cascade division is electrified.
There are to be twelve sidings
runing from the west end of the yard
to the Chumstick bridge, each over a
mile loDg. There will be several other
terminal buildings. For one thing the
machine shop will have larger quart
ers. There will be sand houses, oil
houses, houses for the car inspectors
and repair men. and everything will
be made fire proof as near as modern
methods of construction can make
them.
BY-PRODUCTS PLANT
OWNED BY fRUIT GROWERS
Wenatchee Valley Men Behind Proposi
tion—Will be Ready for Busi
ness Next Summer
What to do with the low grade ap
ples of the Wenatchee valley has been
a vexatious problem, one that the fruit
growers of this valley have given con
siderable thot to in the past few years.
The low grade fruit consists of all that
will not pass under the packing rules,
such as windfalls, limb marked fruit,
fruit that lacks color and size, and such
as has been worm stung and healed
over.
At a meeting of some of the large
growers of the valley held in Wenat
chee last week an organization to be
known as the Skookum Fruit Products
Co was perfected.
The members of the company are
all residents of Chelan and Okanogan
counties. The plant is to be built at
Wenatchee because it is most cc -
trally located and convenient for the
delivery of fruit. The organization of
the by-products plant is really due to
the work done by Barney Sugrue, and
J. B. Adams, who agitated the matter
ever since last iummer and had the
plans matured when the fruit growers
met at Cashmere last Thursday to take
final action. It required little eSort to
secure the fifteen thousand dollars |
necsssary to put the plant on its feet, j
The following officers were elected:
John F. Suerue, president; J. B.
Adams, vice president, and H. J.
Olivr, secretary and treasurer. Trus-•
tees, F. T. Paine, Okanogan; H. W.
Otis, Peshastin; Clifford Chase, Brew
ster; John F. Sugrue. Cashmere; M.
P. Siocum, Monitor; A. E. Manson,
Sunnyslope; W. T. Knapp, Wenatchee;
J. B. Adams, Leavenworth, and Ira
Cleveland, Entitt. The election of;
the trustees must, however, be ratified
by the different units and organisa
tions which they represent.

S. A. Potter files Protest Against
Mayor Elect Hale
Will the recent city election be de
clared null and void? That is a ques
tion ask by many citizens, since Mr. S.
A. Potter filed his protest with the city
clerk objecting to the Council declar
ing W. L. Hale elected mayor. The
protest filed with the clerk, drawn up
and sworn to before Attorney Fox,
recites.
Is*. That in the Third ward one of
the judges did not appear to take his
place on the election board until eleven
o'clock.
2nd. That in the Third ward stickers
were found in the ballot box that must
have come off the ballots deposited in
the ballot box that should have been
counted for S. A. Potter.
3d. That if they had been counted
for S. A. Potter it would have given
him a majority of the votes cast.
4th. That in the Third ward ballots
were put in the ballot-box after being
counted instead of in envelops, and
the ballot box left open several days
before the vote was canvassed.
Wherefore he asks that he be de
clared the choice of the voters for
mayor. And if the council can not see
its way clear to declaring him the
choice of the voters for mayor then
that the election be declared null and
void for irregularities.

THE GREAT NORTHERN'S
FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC PLANT
At Lake Chelan-Will Be Built at Once-
Work Will Begin Early in the New
Year—l2o,ooo H. P.
Immediately aftei his return from a
tour of inspection over the Milwaukee's
electric road in Montana and Idaho, a
a short time ago Mr. Hill gave out the
information that the Great Northern's
electric plant at the foot of Lake Cue
lan would be built as quick as men and
money could accomplish the job.
When President Hill with a number
of other officials of the Great Northern
railroad recently made a tour of inspec
tion of the Milwaukee's four hundred
miles of electrified road, they found it
so satisfactory, so much superior in
every way to the road operated by the
steam locomotive that they then and
there decided to at once put into
effect the Great Northern's plan of
electrifying the Cascade division by the
use of power from the Chelan power
plant, and instructed the enginers to
go to work on the Chelan plant at once.
The information has been definitely
given out that actual work would begin
shortly after the turn of the year.
The Community Concert Enjoy-
able Affair
The third of a series of Concerts, j
very appropriately called "Community I
Concerts, was given in the High
School auditorium last Monday even-1
ing. The room was crowded and j
many could not find seats. These con- j
certs are gotten up by Mrs. Helen H, j
Carter, teacher in the music and art
department of the Leavenworth school,
and the interest aroused in their pre
sentation is a tribute to Mrs. Carter's
good taste in selecting a program, as
well as her energy in securing the co
operation of the best talent in the
town. Every number on the program
was encored. The audience consisted
largely of the parents and friends of ;
the children attending the public
school. Mrs. A. R. McKeon was pre
vented by sickness from being present,
but her numbers on the program were ■
filled with substituted selections by j
Mrs. Carter. At the conclusion of the
program a social hour was pleasantly
spent. Announcement of the next con- i
cert will be made in time to give all
who are interested ample opportunity j
to attend.

mixed up in the H. K. Berry hold-up.
Clark, alias Ellis, who was with Thomp

in the hold-up but has not yet been
sentenced. It will be recalled that
Thompson claimed that thirty dollars
of the forty taken from Mr. Berry was
hidden somewhere. He sent up word
by Mr. Pearson that it was hidden
under a board near the viaduct. Mr.
Pearson and Mr. Graham made a
search and found five dollars and fifty
cents —four and a half in silver and a

WATER POWER DEVELOPMENT
IS MOST RAPID IN THE WEST
California Leads—Alaska Wants Water
Power —A Few Companies Own All
Sites and They are Interlocked
In the fiscal year 1916, says Henry
Graves, Chief of the Forest Service, in
his annual report, 20 new water power
projects which utilizes National Forest
land began operation. This was an in
crease of 18-^3 per cent in the total
number. In the fiscal year 1915 the
number of new projects which began
operation was 12. Forty-two per cent
of the total developed water power of
the United States utilize National For
est land, the Forest Service figures show.
Development of relatively small pro
jects is particularly in evidence, ac
cording to Mr. Graves, in the Rocky
Mountain State. California leads in the
amount of power under permit and in
operation. The number of transmission
line permits in effect was increased by
13 during the year. The 40 applica
tions for power project permits received
in 1916 included 8 from Alaska a nota
ble evidence, according to the report,
of increased local interest in power de
evlopment on National Forest lands in
Alaska.
Concerning the report prepared by
the Forest Seavice in response to a re
solution of the Senate calling upon the
Secretary of Agriculture for information
regarding the ownership and control of
water power sites and any facts bearing
on the question as to the existence of
a monopoly in the ownership and con
trol of hydro-electric power in the Unit
ed States, Mr. Graves says: "This re
port presented in far greater detail than
has ever been attemped before an ex
haustive analysis of the general power
situation. It showed a mark concen
tration of definite and complete control
of a large percentage of developed
water power by a very few companies.
Data presented regarding interrelation
ship through common directors and
principal officers indicated a marked
tendency toward association or com
munity of interests, particularly between
the principal holding companies. The
movement toward concentration in com
mercial central stations of all the pri
mary power employed in the electrical
industries and in manufactures was
found in all sections of the United
I States, the rate of concentration during
the period 1902-1912 being highest in
the South Atlantic States and the ex
tent of concentration greatest in the
western states.
"The rate of increase in water power
development for public service use
from 1902-1912 was approximately
three times as great as in steam power.

$1.50 Per Year
Primary power installation from all
sources and for all uses increased from
1902 to 1912 more than 2-,2 times as
rapidly in the eleven Western States as
in the remainder of the United States,
while the increase for primary electric
power for the same period was 440 per
cent for the Western States, as against
226 per cent in the other States. The
development per capita of the Western
States in 1912 and 2-Ji times as great
as in other parts of the country.
"The report showed a considerable
over development in nearly all the
power centers of the Western States
California, Oregon and Washington in
particular showing installations far in
excess of maximum demands."
THE LEAVENWORTH COLONY
AT PORTLAND MAKE MERRY
Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Hatch Entertained
the Leavenworth Crowd at their
New Home
Last Saturday evening, December 16
Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Hatch, formerly
residents of Leavenworth, entertained a
number of friends at their new home,
writes one of the guests, among which
were some twenty-odd Leavenworthians
now residents of Portland. It was a
Leavenworth evening in every sense of
the word. Leavenworth was almost the
sole subject of conversation. Nearly
all those present have kept in touch
with and know what is transpiring at
Leavenworth, and you may be sure
there was plenty to talk about.
After the subject of the evening was
threshed to a frazzle card playing was
taken up and indulged in to a late
hour, after which delicious refreshments
were served. It was a late hour when
the guests finally took their departure,
perhaps it would be more correct to
say the hour was early, so early they
almost missed the "Owl" car.
The many friends of Mr. and Mrs.
Hatch will be interested in learning
that they have just completed the
erection of a handsome new home at
990 Tibbits avenue, which lor conven
ience and finish, both interior and ex
terior, it would be hard to improve on.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Hatch are de
lighted with the Rose City and will
doubtless spend many years here.
Among the guests were the follow
ing, who will be recalled by readers of
the Echo as having formerly lived in
Leavenworth: Mr. and Mrs. C. A.
Hayden, Mr. and Mrs. Hale, Mr. and
Mrs. Whiteside, Mr. and Mrs. Webb.
Mr. and Mrs. BelliDgham, Mr. and
Mrs. Will Hatch, Mr. and Mrs. Julian
I. Mayar, Miss Hayden, Miss Char
lotta Hale, Arthur Kringle, Alvin Peter
son, Dudley Emmerson, Harry Hay
den and Hugh Hayden.
There are other Leavenworth people
here but they could not be located in
time for this, the first gathering.
Doubtless there will be others. The
friends of Mr. Webb will note that he
has annexed a wife. Arthur Kringle
announced that he would leave the day
before Christmas for Harrison, Idaho,
there to be married, after which he and
his bride will return to Portland to
make their home.
The Skookum Packers As
sociation
After an absence of two weeks Mr.
and Mrs. J. B. Adams returned last
Friday afternoon. Mrs. Adams remain
ed in Seattle with her daughter while
Mr. Adams made a trip thru the appie
district of Oregon where the Skookum
Packers Association, of which Mr.
Adams is president, has a number of
local branches. He is keeping in touch
with the different branches thru out
this state and Oregon. The fruit erow
ers of Idaho are also affiliated with the
Skookum association but the Idaho
apple croD was practically wiped oir.
by late frosts last spring, after the trees
had bloomed, and their apple crop was
a negligible quantity this year. Mr.
Adams says he found the growers who
shipt thru the Skookum association
highly pleased with their returns and
their faith in the association itrength
ened.
