Divorce Decree Regulates
Many Years of Youngster's

ALIMONY TILL HE'S 21.
In Case Mrs. De Saules Re

Although John Longer do Saulls
has been ndjudged guilty of marital
misconduct and a dlvorco decreo
recommended for Mrs. ninnca Erraz
urls do Saul 1 en, tho Chilean beauty,
tho proposed Interlocutory decree
submitted to Supremo Court Jus
tice Pendloton to-day provides "that
If Mrs. da Saulles, tho Injured

her alimony. Tho famous Yale
quarter and varsity captain la to pay
her $300 a mouth until she ro-weds
at which time, If It ever comes, she
Is to rocclvn only f 130.
When tho decree was presented to
Justice! l'endlcton this mornlnir do
Saulles offered no opposition. Neither
was thcro opposition from Miss Joan
Sawyer, tho dancer, whoso name was
mentioned In tho testimony frlvcn
beforo Hefnree Phoenix Intrraham. it
was. to save Miss Sawyer from pub
licity that an nttcmpt secretly to Ilia
tho referee's findings was made last
Monday.
The proposed decree is unlquo In
thnt It Is twlco as low; as usual and
flvo pages are devoted to the cus
tody of the ilo Saullcs's son, John
Longer Jr., who at prosont lives with
his mother. Again Mrs. do Saulles,
the Innocent party to tho. divorce,
does not get exclusive custody of the

I'ntlt Kngland shall be at peace
and tho sens again safe for travel, the
decreo sets forth, young John shall
remain within tho I'nltcd States.
This means that Mrs. do Saullfts can
not, until penco Is dochwed, tako her
con to her own home In Chile, where
tho vast estate of her mother, a

Is located.
After the war Is ovor and until the

bring him bark herself or return hlrn

person by tho llrst of June In each

When John reaches tho ago of eight
his father Is to havo entire control of

TO FOLLOW LEAD IN APPEAL
0 THE MING COUNTRIES
Hopes That the United States
Will Become Clearing
House for Views.
SITUATION CLARIFIED.
Lansing's Two Statements of
Yesterday Handed to Diplo
mats to Be Sent Abroad.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 22. Diplomats
hero aro eagerly watching for Indi
cations of whether ths European neu
trals will follow tho lead of the United
States and make a similar appeal to
the warring powers.
There Is a growing feollng that tho
United States hopes to beconu tho
clearing houso for views and possibly
for terms of the belligerents. Several
of the diplomats havo advised tholr
governments to that effect In order
to guide them In their replies.
Secretary of Stato Lansing two
statements of yesterday, in Inter
pretation of I'resldent Wllson'fl note,
were forwarded to-day to American
diplomats abroad. Tho purpose was
to prevent mlMinC .indlngs ami
r ''itcrprctatlons nbroad.
Dispatch of the two notes will
probably obviate the necessity for a
supplemental note, which Lansing
said he would send If his tlrst "verge
of war" remarks wero misinter
preted.
The fact that tho texts are for
warded to tho diplomats will enable
thorn to present to tho Kuropean
courts as tho otllclal nttltudo of this
government tho Idea thnt tho United
States regards transgressions on Its
rights as Increasingly gravo but as
thus far causing no consideration of
a chango In tho neutrality policy.
Surprltto at tho fast growing signifi
cance of tho President's move was
expressed on all sides, whoro It was
pointed out that nt tlrst tho opinion
prevailed that tho noto Itself was
merely a "foelor" and that tho move
immediately contemplated In Issuing
It waa the receipt of some sort of
definition from the various warring
nations. That tho President should
let It be known Indirectly to tho dip
lomats for their guidance, that he
went even farther than that and
counted on an absolutely frank reply
from tho bolllgorcnt.i which would
lead to an actual opportunity for ne
gotiations, proved only less burprislng
than tho actual noto Itsolf.
This feeling was increased by Sec
retary Lansing's statement yesterday
that no soundings had been taken of
tho attitude of the belligerents ad
dressed and thut tho note had been
sent entirely rcgurdless of tho Central
Powers' proposals or of tho ruply of
Lloyd George.
The question very much to the foro
to-day wns whether tho Kuropean
neutrals would present a united ap
peal. The Spanish and Swiss repre
sentatives here havo been at tho
Statu Department repeatedly since
those proposals came out and proh
ably know fully tho plans of this
Government.
Gradual clarification among the Kn
tente dlplomntd hero nf the PresL
drnt's purposo and Indications that
they would advlsn thnlr Governments
to roply In a friendly spirit proved
sl sourco of deep gratification,
Despatches outlining the Ilrltlnh
nttltudo toward tho noto, as Indicated
by tho nowHpapors of that country,
wero read carefully by Government
officials to-day.
President Wilson Is looking for
nubile opinion in tho belligerent coun.
tries to assist him, and ho believes
that after the noto hns a chanco "to
soak In" there will bo- miirkril chango
in attitude by tho allied press and
public, . - .

The atock market, opening to-day
at nn advnnco over yesterday's clos

throughout tho flve-hour session and

the highest of thp day. Many stocks
regained the lossen' tnourrcd In yea

London Announces That Separate
Replies Will Be Sent to the Ger
man Proposals King Prorogues
Parliament Without Comment on
Wilson's Appeal.
WASHINGTON
WILL NOT BE REJECTED
. LONDON. Dec. 22. An Exchange telegraph de
spatch from The Hague says it is announced that should
the Entente Allies in their reply to the peace proposals of
the Central Powers leave the door open for negotiations
Germany will make known her chief peace terms
immediately.
The German newspapers which contain the announcement declare
that the speeches of Premier Lloyd George and Premier Driand do not
contain a single word which justifies the supposition that the answer of
the I-ntente powers will deliberately reject Germany's peace offer and
that, therefore, the German Government will define its attitude after
receipt of the reply of the Entente allies.
In official and diplomatic circles in London it was generally pre
dicted to-day that President Wilson's note to the belligerents would be
met by a joint reply from the Entente powers. This method of answer
ing the note will differ from the reply to be made by the Entente nations
to the German peace note, in which it Is understood that, while agreeing
to the general principles, each member of the Entente will be free to
express any individual views which they may feel desirable to utter.
It Is hardly likely there will be an early reply to President Wilson's
note, as it is expected full consultations between diplomatists of the
Entente countries will take place before a formal reply is made. Borur
Law announced in the House of Commons that no reply would be made
until after a conference with the allies.
Parliament was prorogued this atternoon without the members being
given any further information regarding President Wilson's note or what
action the Government contemplated with respect to H.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22. Some of the Entente Allies sild ttwliy
that for the same reasons that Great Britain and her allies did not flatly
reject the peace proposals of the Teutonic powers, they will not flatly
lurn down the suggestions made by President Wilson.
