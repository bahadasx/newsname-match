riage, then is marriage necessary for those people to live together, to love
each other and be happy? You must see this, the most wonderful story
ever thrown on a screen, to answer this question. See "The Common Law" by all means. It
is in 8 parts. Prices will be 10c and 20c for matinee 15c and 25c for night. One show at

To a host of our people Mr. Mlady
was known to be an exemplary citizen,
honest and honorable in all his business
dealings, a good neighbor, and to his
family a most kind and affectionate
father who ever looked to the welfare
of those dependent upon him. He was
extremely liberal in his views and ac
corded to others the same measure of
political, social and religious liberty
which he himself demanded, and as
such held the respect and gcod will of
all his acquaintances.
His funeral took place last Friday
morning at the l.O. O. F. hall in charge
of the various orders of which he was
a member, an address being delivered
by Charles Perg^er. He belonged to
aW-'SfasTHlvionorod ^nember-of the Odd
Fellows, the M. W. A. and the Z. C.
B. J. Society of Spillville. Interment
was at New Oregon cemetery.
CARD OF THANKS.
We desire to return our sincere
thanks to all our neighbors and friends

Shooting Affair Near Elma.
As Lli« rpsu!!. of a drunken row fol
lowing a night of drinking and card
playing, Jacob Eggenschwyler is in the
jail at Cresco and his victinn, frank
Meyer, is at the Rochester, Minn., Hos
pital awaiting the result of his injuries.
These men with two others had spent
all of last Friday night at th* Eggen
schwyler home, one niile south and
about forty rods west of Elma, and for
some reason not clearly known to even
the participants themselves, Eggen
schwyler drew a revolver, a 38-calibre,
and shot twice at Meyer, the first shot
tearing away the outside of hie left
ha id and the second penetrated the
left lupig and lodged near the spine.
Although the shooting occurred about
five o'clock in the morning, a doctor
was not summoned until nine o'clock
and all the parties were at the place
when Sheriff Ferrie arrived about three
o'clock and took Eggenschwyler into
custody.
At last accounts, Meyer was slowly
gaining strength and hopes for his re
covery are entertained.

Electrician of recent date says: 'Plans

meet some of the promoters of the
proposed road.

An old inhabitant explains that a
blind pig was located in a building situ
ated on that lot some twenty years ago,
and that the proprietor had a habit of
burying his surplus stock in a hole in
the bottom of the cellar. After the
fire many years ago it was evidently
forgotten, or perhaps they thought it
was spoiled.
But the stuff that made Milwaukee
famous ran make town lots in Elma
draw the spot light and we look for an
advance in vacant lot values right
away. The beer is said to have tasted
very good, although stronger than the
stuff we get now.—Elma New Era.
Bnild Charch at Chester.
Rev. Father Whalen, formerly assist
ant to Father John Hawe when the
Decorah and Bluff ton parishes were
combined, has been appointed to build a
Catholic Church at Chester, Iowa.
Chester has never had a resident priest
nor a church. When the new edifice
has been completed, Father Whalen will
be the priest in charge. While the
church is building he will reside at
Cresco, where he is chaplain of Mercy
hospital. He will divide bis time be
tween the hospital and the building at
Cheater.
In the past several months Father
Whalen has been curate at Lawler. He
visited here with Father Hogan the
fore part of this week and left yester
day for his new duties, which we hope
will be pleasant for him and beneficial
to the church. —Decorah Journal.
Death of Dr. Charles Tnuabail.
The Port Angeles (Wash.) Olympic

the death of a former Cresco boy, Dr.
Charles Trumbull, which occurred at
Seattle, Wash., on Saturday, Dec. 2nd,
after a long illness from liver trouble.
Dr. Trumbull was 58 years of age, was
born in Scotland and in his early youth
came with his parents to Cresco. He
graduated in medicine at the University

Mining Beer in Elma Cellars.
One day last week while Fred Streich
aud Herman Schwake were engaged in
excavating the cellar for Alvin Gross'
new hardware and tin shop on the west
side of Busti Ave. opposite Miller's
store they struck a mine of olden
golden glory, a case of private stock
that had nestled in the bosom of moth
er earth for a score or more of years.
The men were at work with a team and
scraper. Mr. Streich was^driving the
team and Mr. Schwake was holding the
scraper. On the fatal roundjthe scrap
er struck something that made a sound
like breaking glass and there was an
immediate outburst of gas, and Henry
yelled "Whoa, Whoa-up stop, halt."
What's the matter inquired Fred, draw
ing rein. Oh! replied Henry, drawing
a cork," 'I am just going'to set 'em up!
here, have one on me," and he handed
Fred a bubbling, sparkling bottle of
beer. The scraper had broken several
bottles. Oh, w(hy didn't theyjdig that
cellar with a spade, one of those toy
spades like children use to play in sand,
then they might have saved all of the
salvage.
