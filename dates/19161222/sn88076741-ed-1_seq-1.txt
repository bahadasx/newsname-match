THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
The important events in the war zone
have marked the proceedings of the
week. The allies have practically turn
«d drfwn the. peace propose of the
central powers, which caused quite a
disturbance in a commercial way -and
wheat took a jump of about eight cents
on fcheetrength of it. Although no defi
nite proposition foe. a settlement was
submitted by Germany it wfes generally
understood that they were ready to dis
cuss terms.
Immediately after the peace message
was herald and it became known that
there was a possibility for settlement,
and the German forces having annihila
ted the Roumanian army, the French
army on the west made a lunge and
drove the German forces back three
miles and captured something like elev*
en thousand prisoners and a great nuai
bei of heavy artillery.
Since then there has been little* doing
save small skirmishes oh both fronts,
with viotories claimed on both sides.
There is not mnch doubt but that^the
war will be fought to the finish. In the
opinion of some of the best war experts
this will take probably another year.
England is floating another war loan
in this country according to reports
from Walk Street. Canada is beginning
to tear up railroad lines^ that can be
spared and is shipping the rails to
France to be used to extend lines from
the rear to the fighting line, to facilitate
the transportation of supplies.
ARE WE BLIND
TO THE FUTURE?
Drunk, with prosperity tbe people
have given four more years of power to
the Democrats. The spree still contin*
ues,but we are already getting a glimpse
of "the morning after the night before"
in the terribly high cost of living. Mill
ion of people whose incomes have not
been fattened by war orders, or by high
er wages attributable thereto, or by the
sale of farm produots at inordinate pro
fits, are about to face a winter of price
aviation without equal in our history.
What appeal does Democratic prosper
ity make to them?
But there is another phase of tbe sit
uation: when the war ceases we will
lose our war markets, and wages must
return to a peace normal We will no
longer be able to unload wage advances
oato belligerent purchasers. In addi
tion to that, those who were our cust
omers will become our competitors, un
der the present tariff-for-less-than-re
venue policy production will be paid to
labor to meet a living cost which will
show a discouraging fixity of purpose to
stay.
This gives added reason why we
should return to the protective tariff
policy at the earliest possible date.
The farmer, the manufacturer, and the
laborer are making their profits now,
while tbe consumer groans under tbe
weight of expense added to his family
budget, but if the end of the war catch
es «s with the tissue paper tariff bill
forced onto the country by'President
Wilson, industry will bfe stifled by for
eigh competition, tbe laborer-will try
to jaake reservations in the Hotel de
V* j? *V #r
Gink, and the Fleischmann free bread
distributors will be the termer's belt
customeis. About thqf time the cost
of living may gracefully parachute down
ward, but of what consequence is lower
price if there is no money with whioh to
buy.
CLOSE FIGHT FOR
SENATE IN 1916.
The Republican Senatorial Committee
will maintain its existence for the next
two years, at any rate and it may re
main in being for four years more.
The Senate, after the fourth of March,
will present a Democratic majbrity of
twelve, as compared with the majority
of sixteen, which the dominant party
has had since 1915. The success of tbe
Republicans in capturing the House at
the late election is taken as evidence
that the country, though voting for
Wilson on a false issue, is not favorable
to the Democratic party and there will
be no slackening of the effort to continue
Republican supremacy in the lower
branch of Congress and to restore it in
the Senate.
The terms of thirty two Senators will
expire with the next election. Of -thgie
twenty are Democrats, representing tbe
States of Alabama, Georgia, New Hamp
shire, New Jersey, Kentucky, Oregon,
Illinois, Virginia, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Delaware, Colorado, Texas,
Tennessee, North Carolina, Kansas
South Carolina, Mississippi, and Mont
ana. To regain control, the Republicans
must make a net gain of seven.
It is thought that Republicans will
succeed Democrats in New Hampshire,
New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Delaware,
and Kansas without much difficulty.
Colorado and Montana would therefore
become the battle-ground and even if
neither of these States shoud respond to
the Republican appeal, tbe Senate
would then be equally divided and
Democratic control would depend upon
the deciding vote of. Vice President
Marshall.
In 1920, Oregon, Wisconsin, South
Dakota, Nevada, California, Maryland,
and Colorado will center the Republican
senatorial hopes. It is clear that tbe
outcome then will be sharply in favor of
the Republicans, even if the contest of
two years hence should prov6 to be a
draw.
The State of Minnesota dont owe one
cent of indebtedness. Its -resouces are
probably the greatest, everything con
sidered. of any state in th%Union. Last
year they paid off every cent of indebted
ness.
