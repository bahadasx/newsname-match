NEW YORK, December 21.?The

most exciting day in its history with (
one exception. President Wilson's note
to the belligerent power*. followed by
Secretary Lansing's first explanatory
fctatemeut of lis intent, were the or- 1
ca?ion of frenzied selling, which in
scope and volume fairly dwarfed all]
. the operation*' which followed on the
peace proposals from Germany. Prices
were slaughtered to the extent of 5.1
10 and 1.1 points, and in ohe case 33.1
and th* day's sale-< amounted to 3.17C,
000 shares, a total without precedent
since the famous Northern Pacific cor
ner of 1901. The decline was virtually
unchecked, only a few nominal rallies |
occurring In the final hour.
The 1 lquidation of the forenoon, j
amounting to more than 1,300.000
shares Rlone, was confined, as has l#een
the case in the recent operations, to
the s<>. .-yi lle'l "wiir hrldes,'' but so?>n

The weakness of the railway di

Its decline coincided with the declara

ordinary circumstances, might have
been tho signal for an advance.
Texas Company, one of the leading

Much of to-day's selling originated
u sit traders from out of town who
were mainly responsible for she extra
ordinary rise of the preceding months.
In substance, as Wall Street observed
the situation, these outsiders were
vtmply paying back much, if not all,
.their profits in stocks as well as in
C'-aln and cotton. Heavy short sellinj
was attributed to a coterie of uptown
New York brokers who have been ex
ceedingly bearish on the market ever
since peace rumors dawned upon the
financial horizon.
Hanking Interests viewed lo-day's
further shrinkage with equanimity,
having long ago set their faces against
excessive speculation. The evaporation
of profits appears to have been solely

Weather conditions were a train

i same time conserving- the limited paper
! supply of the country. It was bad
j under foot and in the early hours it
? looked like another storm would
sweep the city. In spite of ti'ls han
; dlcap. thousands of the hoys and girls
marched Into the schools with big
bundles under th-ir arms. And it Is
' equally true that thousands of them
again failed to do their duty by not
bringing even a few pounds with them.
The collection, however, was highly
gratifying as the it?<? % *se was nearly
50 per cent over tli? previous week.
The largest percentage of gain was
made at the John Marshall llinh School,
which again led in th>> collection. The
high school pupils gathere.-l a total
I of r.x.sr, pounds, or nearly three
pounds for each. The general average

The children, in many cases, followed
the instructions of The Times-Dispatch
and had their paper tied in bundles
and plainly marked. Many, however,
j failed to do this, and consequently the
| work was made harder for the collec
! tors and dealers. Then, too, many
failed to separate the magazines from
the cheaper grade of paper, which
meant that they could not get as much
as their accumulation was probably
worth, as the cost of separating it
would be prohibitive for the dealers,
who loaded the papers as fast as re
ceived into box cars for shipment to
the mills.
The school authorities, including Or.

It was fully twenty minutes before
the blaze broke through the floors and

EVERETT CENSURED
Committed "Grave Error of Judg

Arranging Print ing Contract.
CHARGES ARE NOT SUSTAINED j
Board Divides, 1 to 3, Minority lied
by Dr. James Southull "Wilson,
Favoring More Drastic Resolution
of Criticism of Editor's Action.
' Divided action was taken yesterday
' by the State Board of Education In
the hearing of the oh arses involving
I pernicious political activity preferred
i by i.'lyde \V. Saunders, chairman of the
I City Democratic Committee, acralnst i
| Joseph W. Everett, editor of the Vlr
; ginia Journal of Education, the differ- j
? ence of opinion being on decision as
: lo whether Mr. Everett was Influenced
by political considerations in taking
i the Journal's printing from Mr. Saun
1 dors. The majority resolution, voted
. for by Governor Stuart, Attorney-Gen
eral Pollard, Superintendent West and
Dr. I'ape. states, after, in effect, ex
onerating Mr. Everett, that he com-j
! mltted a grave error of judgment in
making the candidacy of Mr. Stearnes
j the subject of conversation while ne- J
collating for the printing of the Jour-;
mil.
The minority resolution, offered by
Dr. James Southall Wilson and voted
for by Dr. Wilson, Colonel Ford and,
Superintendent Hart, states that the
board could not declare Mr. Everett i
fr*e from blame, in that his action
might naturally have aroused in Mr.
.Saunders's mind a suspicion that the
] latter's political support of Superin
tendent of Public Instruction Stearnes j
land the question of printing were re-;
i lated.

Three resolutions in all were pre-!
| sented, the third, offered by Superin- i

i paper. The Wilson resolution" was [
I voted down by a majority of one. Gov
J ernor Stuart and Attorney-General
j Pollard, for the opposition, thinking j
! that Mr. Everett had not withheld the]
i printing bid from Mr. Saunders be
I cause of the latter's supposed political
j hostility to Superintendent Stearnes. i
; The minority opinion, as voiced by Dr.
i Wilson and Colonel Ford, was aroused
| by the belief that the matter was too
j important lightly to be passed over,
; and that there was unwisdom on the
| part of Mr. Everett in asking Mr. !
; Saunders for a bid on printing at the
! same time he was approaching Mr.
I Saunders in regard to his political at-,
? titufle toward Mr. Stearnes. The1
smaller side to the controversy took
the view that some action should be
taken to prevent improper political ac
tivity b\ members of the school ser
vice.
Mr. Stearnes withdrew from the dis- !
' cussiou. and did not vote. The matter
had previously been discussed and evi
dence had been heard during three
! days, and the whole of yesterday af- j
; tornoon and part of the night were
| devoted to determination of the que?
i lion.
' TEXT OF IIIOSOM'TIOV
FIX A l.l.l AI)?I>TF.?
The resolution, offered as a substi- ;
i tule for the Wilson argument, and as
: adopted, is as follows:
"Hesolved, first, That Mr. Everett had
! good reason to believe, in taking
the contract for the printing of the
Virginia Journal of Education from;
Mr. <*. W. Saunders and awarding it to
Messrs. Whittet & Shepperson, that in
so doing he was effecting a saving.
"Second. That In tailing such action
he was not controlled by the fact that
Mr. Saunders had declined to commit
himself to the candidacy of Superin
tendent K. <\ Stearnes.
"Third. That Mr. Everett was Justi
fied in not submitting the specifications
upon which the contract was finally
[awarded by reason of the fact that Mr.
! Saunders had repeatedly declined to
j furnish a definite bid because of the '
j condition of the paper market.
"Fourth. That Mr. Everett commit
ted a crave error of judgment in mak
ing the candidacy of Mr. Stearnes the
subject of conversation while negoti
ating for the printing of the Journal.
"Fifth, That there is no evidence that
Mr. Stearnes knew anything of the ne
gotiations between Ulr. Everett and Mr.
Saunders, or that his candidacy was
discussed in that connection."

PRESIDENT'S NOTE i
NOT INTENDED TO
CAUSE WAR SCARE
Secretary Lansing Issues
Formal Statement to
Quiet Apprehension.
HIS FIRST REMARKS HAD
BEEN MISINTERPRETED
Had Referred to Danger of U. S.
Being Drawn In Because of
Invasion of Rights.

WASHINGTON, December 21. ? Presi
dent \\ ilson's note to the belligfrents
urging discussion of peace was offi
cially interpreted to-duy as not bear
ing: any threat that the United States
might be forced tr> enter lite war be
cause of the continued invasion of its
rights by the warring powers on both
sides.
This interpretation was made late
to-day by Secretary Lansing in a for
mal statement issued to overtake what
were characterized as widespread mis
constructions placed on one made
euiller in tiie day, saying that because
of Ih<* increasingly critical position of
the United States as a neutral, it was
entitled to know exactly what each
belligerent seeks, in order that it
! might regulate Its conduct for the
future.
? Secretary Lansing's final statement,
formally prepared and Issued after he
had been called to the White House
j for a conference with President Wll
i son. declared that he had not Intended
1 to intimate that the United States was
considering any change in Its policy
j of neutrality, and that the whole tone
and language of the note were sufll
, clent to indicate its purpose without
further comment on his part.

Mr. Lansing's first statement, made
i orally, and of which no official copy
was distributed, led to exaggerations
I ot its language and purpose t h rough
; out official Washington. its most
j striking phrases on which the widest
speculation was based were that the
. United States was "drawing nearer the
j verge of war." and that the sending
: Of the note "will indicate the possl
? b,Ut>; f'' ol,r *?e'ng forced into the
war. and that neither he nor Presi
dent \\ ;Ison regarded the note "as a
peace note." Secretary Lansing's first
i statement was as follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the
notes were us follows:
; "It Isn't our material interest we
j bad in mind when the note was sent
he a,Ul ni?r? OUI* own ri?:hts are

exactly what each belligerent seeks in

consideration of tho German overtures

of Mi , fl,,co,,lu the formulation
of the document. The only thing the
:o; em,res did was to d. lay it a few
dajs it was not decided to send it
' ties' n "nilay- ?f '-ourae. the diiHcul
es that face the President were that
it might b.. construed as a movement
toward peace and In aid of the German
overtures, n,. specifically denies that

Secreta .?> Lansing further said:
"The sending of this note will indi
cate the possibility of our being forced
into the war. That possibility ought
i to serv<- us a restraining and sobering
lore* safeguarding American rights
It may also serve to force an earlier
conclusion of the war. Neither tiie
President ?or myself regard this note
as a peace note; it is merely an effort
t?> get the belligerents to define the
end for which they are fighting"
When word of what the Secretary
of State had said spread through the
capital it created the greatest con
sternation in official circles and among
foreign diplomats, manv of whom
were calling at the State Department

dispatched to their capital.
i: became apparent that the secre
tary's Statement was not fully approved
at 'he White House, and that there was
(jUfstlon as to the wisdom <.f making
an> comment that might be regarded
"s i ii addition to the note. The White
House was concerned lest any word
reach the foreign capitals to be c-.n
strued as Indicating that the American
note was anything but what it Indi
cated on Its fhce. so. after a conference
between President Wilson and Secre
ta ry Lansing, the second statement
was formally prepared and distributed
