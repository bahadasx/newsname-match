The Type Used in One Year to Pub-
ish Endorsements of Doan's
Kidney Pills
Of the many kidney remedies on
the market today, none other is rec
ommended like Doan's Kidney Pills.
Forty .thousand benefited people
gladly testify in the newspapers of
their own towns. Forty-five hundred
American newspapers publish this
proof of Doan's merit. The type used
in one year to tell this wonderful
story would make a solid column of
metal twice as high as the world's
highest mountain. Placed end to end
the lines of type would reach from
New York to Chicago. These miles of
good words told by 40,000 tongues
sound glad tidings to any Stanford
sufferer who wants relief from kid
ney and bladder ills. Here's a Stan
ford case. Don't experiment. Use the
remedy endorsed bv people you know.
Mrs. W. H. Hill, E. Main St.,
Stanford, says: "I do not hesitate to
endorse Doan's Kidney Pills. I and
others in my family have been bene
fited by this medicine. I felt run
down and tired out and had dizzy
spells and headaches. There were
pains and soreness and a dull ache
across my back. Another of the family
used Doan's Kidney Pills with so
much benefit I tried them and they
soon relieved the backache and put
my kidneys in good order."

High School Notes
(By John Reid McKinney)
The Mozart Club is studing Wag
ner's operas at the present time and
the club's capable president, Miss
Nellie Wilson Hill favored the school
with a talk Wednesday morning, dur
ing chapel exercises. Her subject was
based on the club's last lesson, "The
Flying Dutchman." "The Spinning
Chorus" from the same opera was giv
en on the Victrola and it was not on
ly entertaining but highly instructive.
Miss Hill performed, her part in a
very creditable manner and we hope
other members of the club will favor
us in a similar manner.
Yesterday morning at a little past
nine a good deal of smokwrs notic
ed in the building and it was thought
at first that there might be a fire
in the building. Mr. Wilson, who was
holding a geometry class in his office
at the time stopped the recitation for
a while and began an investigation.
The seat of the trouble proved to be
only a discarded handkerchief which
some one had thrown in a waste bas
bet and when the ashes were raked
out of the furnace it emerged and
caused much smoke.
It has been announced in chapel by
Mi'. Wilson that school will dismiss
Thursday afternoon and not take up
until Tuesday week, which gives a
very nice vacation for Christmas.
A new rule has been put into effect
at the school. Now, during the dinner
recess everyone has to remain in their
room and eat their dinners in their
own seats. After ten or fifteen minu
tes a second (long sounds and then the
pupils are allowed to go out and take
?ome exercise.
Hubble.
Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Murphy have
taken charge of their store at Hubble.
There will be a Sunday Christmas
tree at the Methodist church here.
Mr. D. B. Morris and wife have re
turned from south Geoi-gia, thought
by some of their friends to be a wed
ding trip, but it was merely a busi
ness trip for they have been married
several months. On February the 21st
Mr. Morris and Mrs. Lillie Holtzclaw
drove to Danville and were married
by the judge there. They then went
to Hustonville and spent the night
with Mrs. W. H. Rigney and Mrs.
Morris remained a week with her
cousin and then returned to the
home of her father, W. H. Under
wood where she stayed until she ac
companied Mr. Morris south.
We are expecting wedding every
Wednesday in the Hubble vicinity for
the remainder of the year.
Winter Brings Colds To Children
A child rarely goes through the
whole winter without a cold, and ev
ery mother should have a reliable
remedy handy. Fever, sore throat,
tight chest and croupy coughs are
sure symptoms. A dose of Dr. Bell's
Pine Tar Honey will loosen the
phlegm, relieve the congested lungs
and stop the cough. Its antiseptic
pine balsams heal and soothe. For

Danville Man Pardoned
By Virginia Governor After Serving
Half of 18-Year Sentence
A dispatch from Richmond, Va.,
Wednesday, said: Governor Stuart
today granted a Christmas pardon to
Leek Logan, a Kentuckian, serving
an eighteen-year term in the Virginia
penitentiary for dynamiting a dwell
ing in Wise county, Virginia, with in
tent to kill. Logan left his after
noon for Danville, Ky., where he ex
pects to spend the remainder of his
days with several of his children. He
has been in ill health for some time,
and it is the belief of the prison sur
geon that he cannot live very long.
This was the principal reason clem
ency was extended. Another reason
was that he had made an excellent
prisoner, serving as trusty most of
the time. According to the story he
told at the prison, Logan dynamited
the house in Wise county because he
believed its occupants had cheated
him out of it. No one was killed,
though several were severely hurt.
Logan had finished about half of his
time when he was pardoned.

Rev. Wyatt preached his farewell
sermon at the Baptist church Sunday
night, as the Christian church was
undergoing repairs and the Baptist
brethren kindly invited him to use
their church. It is with deep sciow
we give him up. Besides being instru
mental in bringing many into the
church and getting both church and
Sunday school in fine working ovler,
he was foremost in the move for the
Sunday School rooms which with the
furnace for heating add greatly to
the comfort of the church. He and his
bride are taking with them tho good
will, love and esteem of the whole
church and in commending them to
their work for the church in Ocala,
Fla., we feel that our loss is but the
gain of that church.
Joe King, son of Pate King, of this
place was accidentally shot while out
hunting this week. A colored boy,
named Mullins" fired into a covey
of quail just as Joe and brother, Gran
King stepped from behind a bunch of
trees, also intending to shoot at the
birds. The negro aimed low or the
shot would have been fatal for Joe.
Dr. Harmon attended him and while
a painful wound, it is not serious. No
blame whatever was attached to the
shooting as neither party knew of the
others presence.

MORRIS GOGGIN
Harry Goggin and Miss Elsie Mor

mentioned place and were united in
marriage by the pastor. The couple
endeavored to keep the affair secret
but to no avail. The interested ones
kept a constant lookout for them and
it was impossible to deceive them
even by the couple coming a different
route, so quite a crowd welcomed
them at the parsonage on their arri

He has rented the Swope place in the
Hubble neighborhood. We are confi
dent that with his experience and en
ergy not many years will transpire
until he will be one of the leading
farmers of the community. Miss Mor
