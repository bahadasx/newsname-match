PLAN GOOD
ROADS MEETING
County Organization to Meet
at Grangeville Next Thurs
day to Outline Plans for Se
curing Federal Funds.
The Idaho County Good Roads
Association is planning a big
meeting at Grangeville, Thurs
day, December 28th, at which
time it is proposed to ascertain
the sentiment of the people on
the proposed bond issue. The
legislators-elect, Messrs. Petti
bone, Hussman and Quinlan, will
also be present and the people
will thus be given an opportunity
to confer with them on proposed
legislation, particularly that per
taining to road matters which at
this time is engrossing the atten
tion of all sections of the county.
While it is not likely that any
action will be taken at this time
to make any definite plans for a
bond issue because matters have
not as yet assumed a character
that would make this advisable
at this time, because much will
depend on the action of the legis
lature in dealing with state and
federal funds.
However, this is the psycologi
cal time to deal with this matter
and if we want to share in state
and federal aid it is time some
plan was being worked out
towards that end. The legisla
tors-elect are anxious to know
the sentiment in general towards
the proposed bond issue for their
efforts in the legislature will de
pend largely upon whether Idaho
county will fall in line should
they receive liberal state and fed
eral aid.
If our representatives in the
legislature cannof give reason
able assurance that Idaho county
is willing to do something to help
herself and to at least meet the
terms and conditions approved
by our state Highway Commis
sion it is not likely that the leg
islature will feel well disposed
towards our county in alloting
state aid. It is a foregone con
clusion that the legislature will
provide funds to meet the con
ditions of the federal appropria
tion so it is only a question as to
where and on what projects that
money will be used.
The way the matter stands the
highway commission has con
trol over the federal appropria
tion and the legislature over
state funds. It is plain therefor
that the highway commission and
the legislatures must work to
gether and therefor the recomen
dations of the commission will
have a large influence with that
body. Idaho county is large and
because of geographical condi
tions needs very, very much,
yet her voice in the legislature
is very small. We are to be con
gratulated upon having an able
representation this session and
if given the proper encourage
ment at home they will secure
recognition for Idaho county and
no doubt secure a liberal allot
ment of state and federal funds.
But if they must ask or beg for
it without being able to give as
surance that their county will do
something in the way of meeting
them on some reciprocal basis we
no doubt will hold the sack a
while longer. This much is cer
tain they cannot keep other sec
tions of the state back or fight
the appropriation just because
Idaho county is not ready to meet
the conditions or unwilling to fall
in line. It means state taxes
paid in Idaho for roads built and
maintained in Ada, Bannock,
Boise and other counties.
There is only one thing to do
and that is to fall in line, if we

Fine Farm Book
W. B. Hussman, our enterpris

representative elect, is distribu

friends this week one of the fin

pages and is full from cover to

the farmer. It contains a large
number of articles on farming
and live stock, is nicely illus

buildings with the floor plans of

Eight Big Deer
Miles George and son, William
Collins and E. L. Bently, of
Woodland drove in last evening
from a two weeks hunting trip
on the Selway, and had with
them eight of the finest bucks
we have seen this season. They
were all of the black tail variety
and averaged from five to six
points on either side. •
They stated that the deer were
very plentiful and also the elk,
but there is no open season on
the latter.—Kamiah Progress.

Idaho Gets the Money
Washington, Dec. 19. —The so
licitor of the department of agri
culture has decided that Idaho
has a state highway system that
conforms to the requirements of
the federal good roads act, and
entitles the state to participate
in federal aid to the fullest ex
tent.

Build Road Down Seven Mile
The farmers of the Winona
section and the business «Hen of
Kamiah recently organized for
the purpose of constructing a five
per cent grade up the Seven Mile
canyon and subscribed some
$7500 for this purpose. At a
meeting last week a contract was
awarded to County Surveyor
elect Marsh W. Brown to survey
the road and it is planned to be
gin work on the road early in the
spring, or as soon as the condi
tion of the weather and soil will
permit. With the completion of
a five per cent grade down Seven
Mile most of the grain grown in
the Winona section wiil be hauled
to Kamiah and the road will
eventually become an important
Snow Down to Salmon River
The present snow now extends
down to Salmon river and many
of the stockmen have already be
gun feeding hay to their cattle.
With winter starting in this early
the feed problem will become
serious before spring unless a
break in the season occurs but
many feel that January may
prove to be an open month and
this will aid greatly in tiding
them over until spring. The
stockmen generally are better
prepared with feed than in for
mer years and even should this
prove to be a long winter the
losses will not be as great as in
former years.

down the Clearwater to Lewis

Kamiah are to be congratulated
on their enterprise in taking up
such a difficult and expensive
piece of highway, but their ef
forts will be repaid many times
when the road is finally com
pleted.
During the month of January
the state land department will
offer for sale 9,520 acres of state
school land located in the six
northern counties. Of this a
mount 2040 acres will be offered
for sale at Grangeville on January
27th. Under the old law the
state could sell only 16,000 acres
a year, but will now be able to
sell 64,000 acres annually,
Store Adds Fine Counter
The Cottonwood Mercantile
company installed a fine grocery
counter and accounting system
in their store late last week at an
expense of more than $200 and
are now better prepared than
ever to look after their trade.
The counter is fitted with some
46 bins for all articles in the gro
cery line and a small space is
provided in front of each drawer
to be filled with a sample of the
article contained, so the customer
can see from the front of the
counter just what to purchase.
The counter is one of the latest
devices of its kind and is a ma
terial improvement to the store.
Nice progress is being made
with the preparations for the
community Christmas tree and
the committee in charge states
that everything will be ship
shape for the big event on
Sunday evening. The program
is shaping up nicely and the
ladies have promised to sack up
presents enough for all who at
tend. The tree has been secured
and will be nicely decorated Sun
day afternoon by W. A. Kelsey
Fred Lange, Eugene Mauer and
L. E. Hyde. All indications
point to the occasion being a very
enjoyable one and it is hoped
that every family in the comma
nity will attend the entertain
ment and secure their share of
presents.
