H. Miyake Ends His Earthly
Woes By Cutting His Throat
in Brother's Home
II. Miyake will not go back to Ja
pan, lie is dead by his own hand.
The order of Immigration author!-,
ties, the force of the police and the
laws of Hawaii 'mean nothing now to
the Japanese businessman who has
been in the public eye for weeks.. With
. a razor he cut his throat and bled to
death about 9 o'clock this morning In
the hme of hfa brother, erfo, In
Kallhl-kal. r S
Sheriff Rose Investigated the. death
and will hold an Inquest this after
noon. The victim's surviving wi'e
i nd 19-year-old son, H. Miyake, who
were hurriedly called to - the dead
man's side, say the only reason they
: can ascribe for the suicide is the
worry of continued prosecution by Jo
4ral authorities. -
The dead man was the proprietor
of the Miyake store on Fort street,
opposite the Central fire station, and
. also of the Alyrtle rooming house near
there. The son Is in charge of the
business, but thestore is closed to-
:" day. ''-. ' ' 1
Upon ' Miyake's recent return - from
Japan . with his son he was" de
tained by the Immigration autho.i
. Iks upon evidence collected during
the' trial in police court of Mrs. .Mi
yake on a charge of conducting a dis
; orderly house, and short'y afterward"
he . was urdered deported. His last
hance.to stay In the territory was In
' an appeal for a writ of habeas corpus
to be heard in Jnuary. He had lived
V in Hawaii about 24 years. ; ;
The deceased was about 55 ,J years'
" old and has only one child here, the
son, although it is said that the law
fuj wife lives in Japaja with a daugh
ter :,;;''. . -. :' v'v '
Those who recall the fortitude with
wbich .Mrs. Miyake stolidly tramped
-to police court day after day during
" the disorderly house cases would pos
sibly have been surprised had they
seen" the big Japanese woman over
come with grief ajid sobbing in the
arms of her fion this morning in the
little cottage of the Japanese camp at
the foot, of Puuhale road, where Mi
yake came to bis. end. . . ,
Without making any explanation
Miyake left th .home back of the
store this morning and went directly
to his brother's house behind the poi
factory." There hejasked his slster-in-
, law, Eto Nerlo, to telephone his wife
and son where he was. This done he
professed weariness and asked to lie
down. Eto gave' him a bed In a lit
tle sld room and he asked for anoth
er comforter When she came back
. he was bleeding; to death and in a
; desperate straggle to take the razor
from him the woman was cut, al
though not seriously, on the hand.
. Two letters were found on Miyake's
person, one evidently written shortly
before thp suicide willing; all his prop
erty tp . his son and giving Okubo a
power of attorney, and another writ
ten while he was in the immigration
station, telling his son. not to worry
about the deportation. "I will live in
Yokohama and act as the Japanese
agent and buyer for our store here,"
he wrote.
