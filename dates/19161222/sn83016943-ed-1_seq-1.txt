FROM THE PEOPLE
Letter From Brazil
Bello jQorizonte, Minas, Xov.
18, 1916. This is the harvest sea
son with you and the planting
time here. In your woods the
leaves are brown, golden and
sere and here the young growth oi
spring is new and green, you have
the golden rod and the fields of
yellow daisies and the lespedeza
is mature, and in Brazil the
spring flowers are adding beauty
to the gardens and the lawns and
every valley and hill. But it is
spring here almost the whole
year. The .leaves stay green,
though some of the trees shed both
leaves and bark. The fields and
pastures take on a dried-up ap
pearance throug July and August;
but it is more because of lack of
rain than cold. I would love to
see the swamps and woods where
the hickory leaves are yellow, the
gum leaves red and the holly so
green and pleasing. We miss
that season altogether here, but
the people have never known it,
so they don't feel that homesick
ness for it that I do. Well, I
console myself with the thought
that 12 months of spring should
turn my thoughts of fancy to
thoughts of love much easier than
three months of spring can.
I want to ask Prof. McMillan's
high school pupils some questions
"South of Panama." Before I do
though, I should like to say that
the average person of the United
States is densely ignorant about
South America. About all we
know about it is that it is some
where in the northern part; there
is a large river whose swamp has
trees with limbs that turn down
and take root in the ground, and
that in the swamps are large
snakes, parrots and many mon
keys. All this knowledge is
usually gotten from the school
geographies. The average high
school pupil here can tell-hun-'
dreds of facts About"-the . United
States. They ddjaJt $ now kj much
Latin, Greek and mathematics,
but they have us beaten on world
information and, too, they usually
know French and Spanish lan
guages, are musical and the boys
are given music and painting. I
believe these people are -right. I
like the idea of dividing the fam
ily income equally on music and
art for the boys and girls.
Now, in regard to these ques
tions, don't look for the answers
until you have given them a trial
off hand. They are to test Mr.
McMilian and the other members
of his faculty also. I'd like to see
some ot the answers, off hand, to
these very simple questions:
1. What is the comparative size
of Brazil to the United States of
America!
2. What is the national lan
guage of Brazil!
3. What longitude is most east
erly point of Brazil!
4. What form of government
has it!
5. How many divisions has it!
6. What is its population!
7. What is its religion!
8. What is the capital and its
population!
9. Most of the high school chil
dren can name many of the presi
dents of the United States. Can
you name just one ruler of any
South American country!
10. How many countries south
of the Panama canal!
11. What is the population of
S. A.!
12. Where does its most wester
ly point of longitude touch the
U. S.
Now, these arc general ques
tions, questions any high school
pupil should be able to answer,
yet I could not have answered one
positively a year ago. I am
ashamed that I am so ignorant of
this continent that comprises one
seventh of thejland of the earth,
and you should be also ashamed
of your complete lack of knowl
edge of this half of the western
hemisphere. We have held our
selves the guardians of S. A.
since the passage of the Monroe
doctrine and yet go uninformed.
I hope this is a joke. Yet, not
long ago, a congressman to the
United States a3ked a Brazilian
who was visiting Washington if
Rio de Janerio is the capitol of
Buenos Ayres.
. The fiercest battle in the great
commercial war of the nations of
the world that is suie to follow
the war of arroa pow beiug waged
will be for supremacy of South
American trade. The Europeans
know this country, and when
their salesmen come here they
speak to these people in their own
language and know what they
need and what terms of credit
suit them best. I came down
with about twelve young sales
men representing good business
houses in New York, Chicago,
rhilade'phia anil other cities and
not oue of tbeni knew anything
about these countries nor the lan
guages. When Laucelet Dent and
Finis Carleton are 25 years old
this part of the world will be the
focus point of all the eyes of the
world. Great opportunities will
be here for the thousands who are
sure to come; but without a
knowledge of the people and their
language, any room or company
will be greatly handicapped. I
believe it is essential that every
high school in the United States
J should have an optional course in
the modern Latin lauguages.
These people have great admi
ration for the United States aud
for the people from there, but
they feel hurt that we know so
little about this other half of the
America.
I was in a home in the country
a week ago in company with
Senor Loneta Moreira de Abrue,
the young man who travels with
me, and at dinner one night they
were discussing, in a general way,
beauty. I understand this lan
guage a little, even though I don't
speak it. I know more about it
than any traveling companion
think I know. The lady asked
him (Mr. Moreira) what people
he thought had the prettiest wo
men, and that brought on the dis
cussion. I could keep up with
most of it One favored the French,
one the Italians and one the Bra
zilians, but the lady added that
she thought all Wnglish and Amer
icans ugly, but the dear senorita
added the compliment that all
Americans are intelligent. I never
wanted to talk any worse in my
Ufa. I wanted iffci- "not to
think all men from the United
States look like me, and that she
should see some of the pretty girls
of Macon. I would not have said
some of the grown young ladies,
because I understand 22 have mar
ried in the last six months, and I
never saw a married woman half
as pretty ten minutes after she
marries as she was before. "
I will say somethiug about my
work before I close this rambling
letter.
In my demonstration work I
haye an advantage over the work
inthestatos. If a man agrees to
co-operate with me the work is
done exactly per instructions. I
am having the land prepared just
as I want it prepared, and I cer
tainly believe in thorough prepar
ation. The land was broken with
a9-iuch Avery steel beam plow
with 4 oxen pulling it. After
breaking, the disc harrow was
used until the seed bed was fairly
good (some school teachers I know
in the Macon High School otvject
to the word fairly, but I've seen
it in school books) then I used a
section honow. followed by a
heavy roller and planted flat. I
planted some Texas Durargo,
Mebane's Triumph, some Texas
Big Boll and some native cotton.
Nearly all the cultivation will be
done with "Gee Whiz'' cultiva
tois. Hope to be able to give the
Beacon some interesting reports in
June or July. These people, as I
have already said, believe in us.
They think we do things right al
ways. I don't want to break their
illusion of our perfect methods;
let them go on believing we are,
all the farmers, prepare their lands
just this way. But they want to
know why our acre yield is so
small, and I tell them it is be
cause oi the boll weevil and poli
tics. They can't understand how
politics could enter in, but I give
them to understand that 1 11 ex
plain later on. They ask why we
use so much coffee when our medi
cal men say it is injurious and I
explain, most of it is used by the
hyphenates and the negros; and
why is your alcohol bill so large!
They ask and I say that we use
it for machinery fuel, and that
some states use lots of it to drink,
but that Mississippi men don't
at all now because well, just be
cause they live in Mississippi ;and
that we use lots of tobacco, be
cause most of the farmers have
goue into the cattle business and
tobacco is very essental to protect
cattle against diseases.
I have made friends with some
fine little girls and also some
young ladies, in spite ot tne iaet
that on a vounsr man's third call
on a young lady the head of the
house wants him to state nis rea
son for calling so often. I have
not called but twice on any one.
When I go again well, I'll write
you later about that.
I would like to have about three
girls, about 12 to 15 years of age,
volunteer to correspond with three
little girls here. The correspond
ence, of cource, will be in English.
Thpsp are intelligent little girls
and I think it will be real inter
esting to have letters from a little
foreign friend. The English of
these girls U very amusing. I
also have two frieuds about 16 to
1 a vars old who want to corre
spond with girls rf similar ages,
and I have two friends aboui zz
or 23 who want young lady cor
respondents. N
Now, this may not appeal to the
girls of Macon, but I wish it
would. I think it such a nice
plan. Letter wiiting is au accom
plishment that is so badly neg
lected. This will not only be a
help in that way, but it will be
so instructive ioryou and also for
these girls. You need not be
afraid they are not intelligent
pnmifh tn correspond with; you
may be surprised when you know
them better.
I feel that I should apologize
for this long letter. It is so dis
connected, too.
J. II. IUddon.
From Big Bad.
On the 4th day of January.
1865. a company of tentlemen,
in Cincinnati, 0.. got together
and organized the Union Cent' al
Life Insurance Co., and that
company has had a most remark
able and successful career since
its organization 50 years a?o.
We have been notified by Presi
dent Clark that they will cele
brate .their erolden anniversary
on June 4, '1917. "
Some time last summer he sent
out a statement showing the
tprms nn which aorents would be
invited to attend this convention
at the expense of the company,
vW: Each aerent who Daid for
$20,000 exclusive of terms insur
ance would be given this trip,
and any general agent who's
agency exceeded tne amount
written in iyi5 should also De
invited. A few days ago I was
verv much gratified to receive
the following letter:
President Clark has referred
your letter of the 4th inst. to me
for reply, and 1 am more than
pleased to advise you that your
agency has already settled a
larger amount of insurance, ex
clusive of term, than during
either of the years 1914 and
1915, and by virtue of this in
crease you, as senior member of
the firm, are already a duly qual
ified delegate to the Fiftieth An
niversary Convention.
I assure you that President
Clark, and every officer of the
companyv as well as all of the
agency force who have had the
pleasure of knowing you, will be
sorely disappointed if you fail to
attend the convention. Please
do not disappoint us.
I am pleased to report that
your brother, Van C, has also
qualified on personal production,
and that your son, V. M lacked
'on Nov. 30. but $28,000 addi
tional in order to qualify on the
same basis.
Looking forward to the pleas
ure of meeting you again, I am,
Chas. Hommeyer,
Assistant Supt. of Agents."
I am glad to state that Mr. W.
Cavett has also qualified since
the receipt of thi3 letter.
I am publishing this because I
am sure that our many friends
will' be gratified to know of tne
success of our agency.
Will and Van. as members of
the firm put in the majority of
the business which has made it
possible for the agency to qual
ify. With best wishes, I am,
Yours truly,
Big Bud.
Give gifts within your means. Do
not let the custom become a burden.
A letter to an absent friend would be
more to him than something bought.
Don't spend money on gifts that in
justice belongs to the payment of your
debts. Merry Christmas to all Beacon
readers.
