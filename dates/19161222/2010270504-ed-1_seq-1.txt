Weather Observor Shilling is an

a. littlo too enthusiastic in his good
work. The Trlbuno suggested that if
ho would give u -a couplo of inches
of snow Christma would seem moro
Christmas-like, and tho two inches of
snow was immediately forth-coming.
But with it came a decided drop in
temperature, the mercury descending
to ten below zero Tuesday night and
seventeen below Wednesday night.
VVhen Mr. Shilling was reprimanded
for tho cold, he apeared somewhalt
grioved and said: "Well,. I heard Bill
McDonald say that usually if wo did
n't have a crop of ico around Christ
mas, chances were we couldn't got
any, and I honestly thought tho people
neeaeci tne ice." wnen no saiu tnat
wo caught him by tho hand and shook
it, said we were sorry wo had scolded
him, and wished him a merry Christ
mas. : :o: :
