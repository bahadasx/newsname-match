PRESIDENT WILSON APPEALS
TO WARRING NATIONS
Formal Notes are Sent to Warring
"Powers Asking Their Views
- ' On Peace. ,
Washington, Dec. 20. President
Wilson has appealed to all the bel
ligerents to discuss terms of peace.
Without actuaiiy proposing peace
or offering mediation the president
has sent formal-notes to the govern
ments of all the warring nations sug
gesting that "an early occasion be
sought to call -out from the nations
now at war such an avowal of their
respective views as to the terms upon
which the war nght be concluded
.and the arrangement which would be
deemed satisfactory as a guarantee
against its renewal or the kindling
of any similar conflicts in the future
as would make is possible, frankly,
to compare them."
Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration cf-
cials have described as his course
the president last night dispatched
the notes to all the belligerents and to
all the neutrals .for their information.
Summarized in the president's own
words, as contained in the note, his
attitude is as follows:
, "The president is not proposing
peace; he is not-even i off erftig medi
ation. He is merely proposing that
. soundings be taken jp. order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with'
the belligerents, how near the haven
iof peace may be for which all man
kind longs with an intense longing.
He believes that the spirit in which
he speaks and the object which he
seeks will be understood by all con
cerned, arid he confidently hopes for
a response which will bring a new life
into the affairs of the world."
This latest development in the rap
id world event towards a' discussion
of peace was not permitted to become
known until tonigM when the notes
were well on their way to the Amer
ican ambassadors in the "belligerents
and probably already in" the hands of
some of them.
