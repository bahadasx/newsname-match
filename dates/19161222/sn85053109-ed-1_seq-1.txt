Two Dollars Per Year
G. N. to Enlarge Yards
At Cut Bank in Spring
Will Add Four Miles of Yard Track
and Double-Track Between
Between Cut Bank
and Shelby
(Great Falls Tribune)
Although the Great Northern
is planning the expenditure of
at least $500,000 in Great Falls
during 1917 in the construction
of new freight yards costing
about $200,000 and new shops
which will require about' $300,
000, this constitutes only a
small part of the improvement
work which will be carried on
in the state by that railway
system.
It has just become known
that a great amount of improve
ment work is scheduled for the
main line of the system in the
northern and northwestern part
of the state, which will consist
principally of the enlargement
of the freight yards at Havre
and Cut Bank and in double
tracking of certain portions of
the main line.
Bids have just been called
for by Resident Engineer P. S.
Hervin, of this city, for six big
pieces of work along • iha main
line, the same to be submitted
on December 30, either at his
office in this city or to Chief
Engineer A. H. Hoagland at
St. Paul.
Under the contracts to be
awarded following the submis
sion of. bids, 44 miles of the
main line, in four different dis
tracts, are to be double-tracked
Real 'Short'
The Farmers' Short Course
held here the latter days of last
week was a "short course" in a
verv literal uense, not more
than half a .dozen farmers at
tending any of the sessions.
County Agriculturist J. M.
Davis stated that the meetings
at the other towns in the county
were poorly attended also. "In
the first place the farmers are
very busy" said Mr. Davis "and
in the second place they have
become so prosperous through
the ordinary methods in farm
ing that they are no longer con
cerned about the "Campbell
System," The Shaw ideas or
any other system of scientific
farming. "In my heart I can
scarcely censure them and I
hope they will not have reason
to regret their indifference to
wards these things but I fear
they are too much carried away
by their marvellous success in

as the initial steps in a plan for
the ultimate double-tracking of
practically the whole line lead
ing up to and through the
Rocky mountains.
This work will consist of four
miles of double-tracking be>
tween Havre and Pacific Junc
tion, 25 miles of double track
between Shelby and Cut Bank,
nine miles of double track be
tween Columbia Falls and
Whitefish, and a change of line
and construction of double
tracks between Essex and Java.
Up to the present time the
company has but 14 miles of
double track in this state, this
having been built in the past
few years in the vicinity of the
summit of the Rocky moun
tains.
In addition to this proposed
work, the yards at Havre and
Cut Bank, both division points,
are to be enlarged. At Havre
he present freight tracks will
be lengthened to 4,000 fept and
four additional tracks will be
laid, thereby adding about six
miles of track to the present
yard.
At Cut Bank, the tracks will
be made 4.000 feet in length and
three more tracks constructed,
thereby increasing the yard by
about five miles of tracks.
the past couple of years—and
it is a degree of success such as
no other new farming region in
Amer'ca has experienced."
Expanding
Charles Kleinschmidt was in
Saturday and stated that he
was negotiating for the pur
chase of the Clyde Mallo ranch
adjoining his homestead, con
sisting of 320 acres. Charles is
one of the most successful far
mers in that section and now
becomes a landowner on quite
a large scale.

North Headlight
is Prosperous
BY LEA LANGABEER
For the past year the Pio
neer Press has printed items
from the North Headlight
section. In the Christmas
issue of the Press last year
we described ourselves fully
and told fyow happy and how
proud we were over our big
crop. Still we are happy
Last wheat and
Last vear wheat and
yielded so largely that our
friends in the east refused to
believe the reports. This
year flax was King, although
wheat and oats were above
any Qjther state.
Twenty five bushels to the
acre was only an average
crop. Many threshed larger
yields. John Hall, who lives
north of here, broke the
world's record by threshing
a crop* of flax that averaged
38 bushels to the acre.
Many new buildings have
been erected in this vicinity
during the year, not only
granaries and barns but a
number of new and up-to
date bungalows.
Harris-Olson
Charles Wesley Harris and
Miss Harriet Olson will be
married in Great Falls tomor
row, December 23. This is sup
posed to be a profound secret,
but the sleuth reporter of the
Pioneer Press spoiled it.
Mr. Harris has been a resi
dent Cut Bank for over a
year and has gained a good
reputation as a young man of
character and industrious in
clination. Miss Olson, who is
one of the primary teachers in
the local school, has been here
but a brief time, but has be
come very popular and is re
puted to be a successful teacher.
It is understood that the young
woman will resume her duties
in the school after the holiday
vacation.
Our best wishes to the bride
and prroom to be.
Hauling With Tractors
Brady Citizen: For a short
time this week it looked as if
the horse had been supplanted
by the gas engine for hauling
grain. J. A. Reed of Genou,
came up the street with his
tractor dragging five wagon
loads of grain to the elevator.
A little later up the street at a
good pace came a big gas truck
with Walter Jensen at the
wheel loaded to capacity and
pulling a big trailer. They were
able to make good time and
haul big loads over the newlv
graded road east of town.

Lloyd George Declares
War Will Not Cease
England's Leading Statesman, in a
Ringing Address, Says the
German War Dog Isn't
Yet Chastened
London, Dec. 22—Premier Uovd-George said in the
house of commons today that it was felt that tht-v shou'd
know before entering on negotiations, that Germany was
prepared to accede to the only terms whereon it u as pos
sible for peace to be obtained and maintained in Europe.
The premier said that without reparation peace would be
impossible.
The premier said there were no proposals tor peace and
that to enter into proposals of which they had no knowl
edge was to put their heads into a noose with the rope end
in Germany s hands. "As much as we may long for it,"
the premier added, "the central powers' note and speech
preceding it afford small encouragement and hope for
honorable, lasting peace." The premier further said:
"Our answer will be given in full accord with our allies.
Each of the allies separately and independently has arrived
at the same conclusion. I am glad that the first answer
was given by France and Russia."
Lloyd-George said the allies would insist that the only
end of war must be a complete guarantee against Prussian
militarism disturbing the peace of Europe. The formal
reply of the allies will be given in a few days. The pre
mier said, "We will wait until we learn what terms and
guarantees that are surer than those which the Germans
broke. Meanwhile we will put our trust in our unbroken
army."
When the house assembled every seat on the floor and
galleries was filled. Diplomatic representatives of Great
Britain's allies occupied seats in the gallery for distin
guished strangers. On the benches reserved for the lords
were the members of the upper house who took a prom
inent part in bringing about the recent change in govern
ment. There was also a scattering of Dominion ministers.
'During the war," the premier said, "shipping will be
nationalized in a true sense."
