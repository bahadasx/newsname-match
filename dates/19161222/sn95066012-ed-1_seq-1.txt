Jennings Is Also Given Beauti
ful Memorial Address.
On the eve of bis departure for El
mira, the Rev. Isaac Jennings, D. D.,
retiring pastor of the Old First
church. Old Bennington, was the re
cipient of a handsome testimonial at
the hands of a committee of his par
ishoners and neighbors Thursday af
ternoon. For some weeks past a movement
has been on foot to express in some
suitable manner the appreciation of
the entire community of the work
which Doctor Jennings has done, par
ticularly in investigating the early
history of the town, and of Vermont
in general. The result was manifest
ed when Arthur J. Holdcn, chairman
of the committee, handed to Dr. Jen
nings a beautifully engrossed and il
luminated address and a check for
more than eight hundred and fifty dol
lars. The presentation was made at the
home of S. L. Robinson and all the
members of the committee were pres
ent. The affair was an absolute sur
prise to Dr. Jennings, who had no
idea why he was called to the home
of Mr. Robinson at that time.
Mr. Holden made the presentation
in a very graceful speech. He said,

( that you were obliged to close your
' ministry: in this .village the entire
1 community, felt the keenest regret.
ror eleven years, aim mure, . mum,
you have been wlth us as minister,
and before that was the ministry of
your . (father. Together yon have
served the old church and the com
munity upwards of half a century.
Both of you have not only made
history" in that service, but you have
rendered a great service to all i ho
love tVermtmt ' by your scholarly ; in
vestigations Into its early History,
and your efforts in making that his
tory known to all.
A spontaneous movement, repre
sented by this committee, arose to ex
press to you. Sir. our love and ap
I preciation of all that you have done,
all that your presence has meant to
us and to all the people of the com
munity. We have tried to indicate
our feelings in this address which I
hand to you. With it I hand to you
on behalf of your parishouers, your
neighbors and friends a check. We
thought that you might bo able to use
the money to good advantage in con
nection with your historical re
searches. If you so decide, it will be
a source of pleasure to us to know
that it helped to facilitate the publi
cation of the important historical
papers which you have prepared.
The address is a masterpiece of the
art of engrossing and Illuminating by
hand. It is in book form, each para
graph being on a separate page, exe
cuted In a different style of type, the
colors beinc .black and gold, it is
handsomely bound. in soft gray leath
er, lined with silk. On the outside
the name of the recipient is embossed
in gold' and the whole Is contained in
a case. All who have seen it declare
it to be a magnificent piece of work.
The address reads as follows:
To the Rev. Isaac Jennings, D. D.,
.Minister of the Old First church.
Old Bennington, Vt.
Reverend and Dear Sir:
We, the undersigned, a committee
representing your parishoners, and
your neighbors and friends regard
less of sect or creed, at the close of
your ministry in tho Old First
Church, Old Bennington, Vermont,
desire to express to you our grateful
appreciation of your work in the com
munity and our regret that the im
pairment of your health makes its
continuauce impossible.
In tho historic old church of your
boyhood, in which your honored and
revered father was minister, you
have for eleven years worked with
gentle Christian courage, unfaltering
faith and ripe scholarship, minister
ing to all with boundless devotion.
By your extensive aud scholarly
researches into the early history of
Vermont, and especially of Benning
ton, you have rendered tho state an
incalculable service and placed all
students of its history for all time to
come under gre-.it obligation.
It is our most earnest hope that
your retirement from active minister
ial work will afford you leisure and
opportunity to prepare for publication
the priceless historical paper which
you have from time to time read at
the Old First church and elsewhere.
Assuring you of the lasting friend
ship and esteem of all your parish-
oners and neighbors.
We have the honor to remain,
Very sincerely yours,
Arthur Holden, Chairman,

Catherine Jane Hubbell, .

December 1910. I
Overwhelmed by tho tribute paid
him. Dr. Jennings found it very dii
flcult to make reply. In a voice that
trembled with emotion, ho said. In
part:
"I love Old Bennington. I love not
only the friends of old. associated
with memories of the long past, but I
love the new friends who have come.
with whom 1 have made many dear
ties. I love the Old First church. I
am leaving its ministry, not because ;
I would, but because I must. The
All-Wise Father knows what is best.
His work Is not dependent upon any
one man. You .will have a new minis
ter and he will lead you along toward
the heavenly goal.
We have been very happy here, my
wife and I. Wo do not like tho
thoughts of going from here. In these
recent days we have often wondered
If we can ever hope to be as happy
any where else as in Old Bennington.
Fortunately, we do not have to break
completely yet. I shall come back
again after a short time, and both of
us expect and hope to come again and
again to the dear old home.
It is impossible for me to thank you
for this gift and for the spirit back
of the gift. I feel that I have done
very little. But I have done my best
and have had a most efficient helper
in my wife. I hope that after a few
weeks, when l am rested somewhat,
to tako up tho work of preparing tho
historical papers to which Mr. Holden
so generously referred for publica
tion, and It will be a Joy 10 use your
gift in that connection. In my col
lection of Bennington books this ad
dress will be tho most prized as it is
the most, beautiful. 1 cannot say
more perhaps I have said enough.
On behalf or my wife for your gift
to her. thank you. For this wonder
ful gift to me. thank you and God
Bless you."
Tho gift to Mrs. Jennings was a
check for one hundred dollars from
the ladies.
After a few informal remarks from
members of the presentation commit

WAR RELIEF WORK
Mr. Mills Urges That This Opportuni
ty Be Taken.
Editor of The Banner: There is
an opportunity which the people in
tho churches next Sunday ought not
to lose. It is to make some gift to
the War Relief Funds.
We have had. at .intervals Ju our
churches special offerings for one
and another of these Funds, and they
have been creditable in amounts. But
wo must keep on giving. It is our im
perative Christian duty to do this.
Many of us are receiving literature
from the various head-quarters of the
War Relief Organizations. It is heart
wringing beyond words. We simply
cannot turn a deaf ear to these ap
peals. We have great abundance here in
Bennington. Our merchants tell us
the Christmas trade was never better.
We are generous in remembering our
own. But God forbid we should pass
by the sufferers In Europe!
Several earnest people have asked
me within the last few days "Shall
wo give through the church?" And
my answer is, "Give in any way."
But it is convenient to give through
the church, and every church I am
sure, keeping the record of theso
gifts, would be properly gratified to
realize that Its members were doing
their part, that as a church it ws
not indifferent to these moving calls
for help.
The church treasurer of the Second
Congregational church, for example,
has all the addresses of the War Re
lief Funds. It is a simple matter to
enclose your gift In an envelope,
mark it "War Relief," and if you
especially wish, designate it for a
particular Fund as. Albania, Bel
glum, Poland, Servia, Armenia and
Syria. Permanent Blind, Red Cross,
Starving Children of Europe, or any
other Fund, and place it on the
church collection plate.
Shall wo not this next Sunday, hav
ing planned our Christmas gifts, give
this one gift more for the sake of our
pitiful common humanity and the lovo
of the Christ?
Georgo S. Mills.

FEAR LANSING ftlAY
HAVE CREATFD
COUP ICA IONS
Official Washington Jnxious Over
. Secretary of State's Blunder
HIS INTIMATIONS UNWARRANTED
President'a Note Sufficient in Itself
and Requires No Interpretation
by Secretary.
Washington, Dec. 22: The situa
tion created by President Wilson's
"peace note" to the belligerents is
still a question duo largely to Secre
tary Lansing's blunder in his state
ment which said in effect that the
chief reason for the note was the
danger of the United States being
drawn into the war.
Heroic efforts were made last night
to overcome the effect of Secretary
Lansing's mistake. He was called to
the White House by the president and
then declared he had not intended to
intimate that the United States was
considering any change in Its policy
of neutrality and that the whole tone
and language of the note were suffi
cient to indicate its purpose without
further comment on his part.
Tills reversal of the secretary of
state has made It clear here that the
note is Intended to stand on its own
bottom and is not to be construed ac
cording to Mr. Lansing's first state
ment but the effect of his words in
foreign capitals Is feared.
Absolute and startling surprise was
the first feeling in Great Britain
aroused by President Wilson's note,
said a dispatch from London last
t night. The government was sur
prised, and frankly admitted it The
members of Parliament were equally
surprised, when the news spread
through both houses during the after
noon session.
