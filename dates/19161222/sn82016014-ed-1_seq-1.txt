Just in time for Christmas with the
flks nt home. Battery A and the
hospital corps arrived at the Union
Pacific depot at 2:15 o'clock and the
train was immediately switched to the

Boys Look Fat and Fine.
It was a sight for loving eyes
those soldier boys who had been on
tile border since summer. Many left
Topeka with sallow faces, stooped
shoulders and the hundred and one
otln r things incidental to the life of
a younir man in the city.
A farmer boy hasn't a thing on the
Ilatterv A boys from the standpoint
of perfect health, broad shoulders,
round cheeks and glowing spirits. Not
a one who left Topeka is on the sick

Kew batteries or companies have
had the opportunity for real military
training that fell to F.attery A's lot.
The battery upon its arrival at Eagle
l'ass was made a part of the Third

the order from morning until night.
Ken I military men supervised their
work and Hattery A comes home with
a consciousness of getting everything
that was coming to it in the way of
active field service and commenda

watched the transformation of the
raw Topeka boys into trained soldiers.

THE PAPER CRISIS
The High Prices Ruling for
White Paper
Threaten the Very Existence
of Many Dailies.
EIGHT HUNDRED SUSPEND
Twenty-Eight Have Quit in
Oklahoma.
Big Dailies and Small Ones to
Wits Ends.
The news dispatches make reports
of the committees representing the
daily newspapers of the country who
are in Washington appearing before
the federal trade commission to see
what relief can be secured in the
1 resent white paper crisis.
The situation was probably never so
critical in the newspaper business.
George W. Marble of Fort Scott, rep
resenting twenty-five daily newspapers
of Kansas, was one of the witnesses
before the commission. He repre
sents the Kansas Daily league, which I
is taking steps looking to, an assur
ance of supply of white paper at
r, ices at which it will be possible for
them to continue publication. The
league regards the situation so criti
cal that the very existence of the
papers is threatened by their inability
to secure white print paper, except at
prohibitive prices.
Twenty-eight papers have already
suspended business in Oklahoma be
cause they were unable to pay the
high prices demanded for their raw
materials,
H. j. Rogers, president of the Amer
ican Newspaper Publishers associa
tion and business manager of the
Chicago News says: "Some publishers
come to their office each day without
knowing whether they will have
enough paper or. hand to issue an
edition the following day."
Mr. C. L. Day, in an address before
the California Press association,
says: "Eight hundred country town
newspapers in the t'nited States have
su fended publi ation since the price
of news print paper began advancing."
The New York Daily Globe an
nounces that it has increased its sub
scription price from $3 to J6 per year
and has reduced its volume of reading
matter 15 per cent and increased its
advertising rates, eliminating all free
reading notices.
Papers Will Be. Smaller.
The newspaper reader pays so little
for his paper as a rule 1 or 2 Vents
a copy, or 10 cents a week that he
has apparently given himself little
concern about the price and does not
realize what a struggle is going on in
the newspaper offices all over the
country to meet the new conditions,
of raw materials increasing 50 and 100
per cent and over.
For the last year, all sorts of prices
for all sorts of commodities and serv
ices have been constantly advancing
and, as a rule, where the public has
thought these advanced prices were
reasonable and warranted, it has paid
the new prices without particular op
position. When a merchant has been
obliged to pay more for his goods he
is expected to charge more to his cus
tomers, otherwise he must cease doing
business.
The newspapers have been. meeting,
for more than a year, numerous ad
vances in the cost of labor and raw
material. A year ago an advance was
made to those employed in the print
ing offices and, on the first of January,
another advance goes into effect un
der the contract.
This past year the newspapers have
paid increased prices for everything
that has gone into the production of !
a paper; wrapping paper has doubled;
ink prices have increased; twine has
doubled: stereotyping metal has dou
bled, white paper is doubling. Be
ginning with next year, newspapers
will be required to pay from 60 to
over 100 per cent advance in the price
of white paper above the cost on con
tracts made a year ago.
This expense will have to Je met
and papers are sure to cost more and
subscription prices will he advanced
these things are inevitable. Some of.)
this expense may be met by reducing
1.14c yL senior tne news in
smaller type: reducing the number of
pages printed but indications point
to the fact that an increased price is
necessary too.
Many daily papers have already ad
vanced their rates, some 100 per cent.
The papers of Sioux Citv, la., have
advanced from 1 to 2 cents per copy;
the Lincoln papers have done the
same thing, all the Pittsburg evening
papers have advanced from 1 to 2
cents per copy; the Des Moines papers
have doubled their prices. The To
peka reader Inay, therefore, expect,
in view of these conditions, that he
will have to pay more for his papers;
probably an advance of from 2 cents
per copy to 3 centsor even 5 cents

IN CASE OF WAR
BIG STEEL PLANT
GOES OVER TO U. S.
Bethlehem Company Larger
Than Germany's Greatest.
President Schwab Promises
Use of Krupp's Only Rival.
WONDERFUL ASSET TO NATION
This Country Is Able to Meet
Any Competition Xow.
Erecting $4,500,000 Factory to
Build 16-Inch Guns.
New York, Dec. 22. If the United
States should ever enter war, the
munitions plant of the Bethlehem
Steel company, greater than the fa
mous Krupp works at Essen, Germany,
would be turned over to the uses of
this government, Charles M. Schwab,
president of the Bethlehem Steel com
pany, said in addressing the members
of the Lotus club.
With a capacity of one million
rounds of heavy ammunition a month,
Schwab said his plant was 50 per cent
more efficient than the Krupp works.
He characterized it as one of the
greatest preparedness assets of the
United States.
"I am an optimist." said Schwab,
speaking of peace. "Some see disaster
if peace comes, but I look upon peace
as a blessing and I should rejoice in
it if it came. Rut we want a conclu
sive peace and not a peace which will
merely presage another war."
Meet Competition.
Admitting that the United States
industrial world is to meet strenuous
competition when peace comes,
Schwab said he felt this country would
be able to meet any competition, and
urged a greater American marine as
one of the means of meeting foreign
competition.
As an impetus1 to American ship
ping, the steel magnate suggested that
American vessels be given a lower toll
rate in the Panama canal than foreign
vessels.
Schwab announced that the Bethle
hem company had made plans for the
erection of a $4,500,000 plant for
building 16-inch guns for the Ameri
can navy.
Federal armor plate plants were at
tacked by Schwab.

RESENT NEUTRALS' SELF DEFE
Bonar Law Gives Terse Reply
to U. S. Peace Feeler.
"War is for Peace Now, Future
Guarantee for Peace."
London, Dec. 22. The more Eng
land digests President Wilson's peace
note, the more bitter it feels. That
was conclusion to be drawn from
newspaper editorials in the afternoon
papers which went even further than
those of the morning editions in denun
ciation of the American executive'3
move.
The afternoon press was a unit
in its resentful ness. This bitterness
was particularly manifested against
Wilson's assertion that the objects for
which all belligerents were striving
were virtually the same.
"It is singular indeed the Evening
Standard declared, "that a statesman
of Wilson's perspicacity can labor un
der the delusion that any move of
his toward peace woirld be welcomed
by the allies. The whole facts of the
situation should warn him that inter
vention is not desired."
Invite Wilson to Stay Out.
"We sincerely hope President Wil
son is not ill." the Globe commented,
"but we have grave doubts of his
physical well being."
"Our tcelings against outside action
to stop the war before the essential
objects have been attained are only
what President Wilson's great prede
cessor felt when threatened with Eu
ropean intervention in the middle of
the Civil war," declared the Westmin
ster Gazette. "But if President Wil
son has knowledge, hitherto denied us,
that the enemy is willing to acknowl
edge our claims, he well knows we
would be the last to reject his good
offices."
Consult Before Reply.
London, Dec. 22. The British gov
ernment will make no statement in
regard to President Wilson's peace
note, considering it a question that
can be dealt with only In communica

entente. Announcement to this effect
was made in the house today by An-

CHECKSHJR XMAS
Santa Fe Bonus Money Is
Given Out Today.
More Than $250,000 To Be Dis
tributed in Topeka.
The bonus checks for the Santa Fe
employes in the general offices at To
peka were distributed this afternoon.
At noon today it was found that the
Job of making out the checks had
progressed so far that it was pos
sible to give the office employes their
money today. It was announced ear
lier this morning that the checks
would be out tomorrow.
The men at the shops will receive
their checks tomorrow.
Only a few employes of the system
will not receive their checks until the
first of next week as it is impossible
to get them in their hands before that
time. The amount of bonus to be dis
tributed in Topeka amounts to be
tween $250,000 and $300,000.
The treasury department of the
Santa Fe has made something of a
record in getting the checks ready for
the men. Work of making up pay
rolls began in the various departments
immediately after December 1 5, and
the accounting department has been
putting forth every energy to get the
railroad's Christmas gift to its men
during the holidays. The bonus in
cludes men and women in the employ
of the road, and eligible to participate
in the distribution, November 30, and
those on leave of absence, not exceed
ing three months, when the directors
declared the bonus. It also includes
the men on the border.
'BREATHED HYPOCRISY'
Perkins Issues Scathing Statement On
Note to Warring Nations.
New York, Dec. 22. George W.
Perkins issued a statement today in
which he declared President Wilson's
note of yesterday breathed hypocrisy
and Secretary Lansing's statements
breathed incompetency. The statement
follows;
"Any school boy ought to have
enough intelligence and patriotism to
blush with shame at their actions,"
the statement said. "In the first
place, the president's letter was weak
i And pointless and offered a gratuitous
insult totn allies when he said 'each
side desires to make the rights and
privileges of wak people and smaller
states sc-curs.'
"The letter bears everv indication
of having been written for the sole
purpose of 'butting into the situation.
No wonder London prevented the pub
lication of the note on its receipt."
American Express Bonus.
New York, Dec. 22. The American
Express company today announced a
bonus of one month's salary, payable
in quarterly installments to all em
ployes who have been one year or
longer in its service and who receive
$2,000 or less annually. It is estimat
ed that the award w-ill total about $1,
250.000 and that 12,000 employes will
benefit.

GET IDEA FROM DAYTON, OHIO
First Step Towards Adopting
City aMnager Policies.
Mayor Says People Should
Know What's Going On.
Shortly after January 1, tae city of
Topeka will again break all local pre
cedents when advertising space will
be purchased in both daily papers ind
the work done by each department
will be set forth in display advertis
ing. The first series of advertisements
will place before the public the work
done by each department cf the city
during the last year. It may be that
these first displays will cover all the
work done under the commission form
of government.
From then on the work done by the
city will be displayed in advertise
ments in both papers. Mayor Jay E.
House has writen to the city of Day
ton, where similar tactics are pur
sued and in a short time will receive
copies of advertisements carried by
that city in Dayton's daily papers. The
Topeka plan probably will be similar
in most details to the Dayton scheme.
"So People May Know."
"In short," said Mayor House' to
day, 'every man, woman and child in
Topeka who cares to know what the
f.ity is doing car. find out very easily
by reading the Topeka dailies."
It does not mean hat advertise
ments will appear daily. Details con
cerning the number of advertisements,
the time of their insertion and the
writing of advertisements will be
worked out later. The commissioners
have had the plan under consideration
for some time but it was not until to
day that they decided to make a pub
lic announcement.
Already Commissioner Tandy has
men in his office preparing data con
cerning the work done in his depart
ment since the commission form of
government has been in effect in To
peka. The cost of work done in his
department and every detail will be
explained by Mr. Tandy. Other com
missioners are preparing for as ex
haustive reports in their departments.
Balk Manager Plan.
From a political standpoint this in
novation of the city commissioners is
looked upon as a forerunner of a de
fense that will be made for commis
sion form of government any time the
city manager plan is projected seri
ously by people, whom the commis
sioners believe are attempting to un
seat them for reasons of revenge. The
commissioners d onot intend to walk
into any trap if possible, it is asserted,
and are willing to admit that there
may be certain modes of conducting
the business of the city of Dayton un
der the city Manager plan, that sur
pass the present method of city man
agement in Topeka.
But by adopting schemes in effect
in Dayton which seem practical they
are expected to endeavor to prove to
the public that they are not averse to
Dayton suggestions and are willing to
adopt those believed practical. Yet,
it is believed they will claim and have
proof to bear out their assertions
when the battle cry is sounded, that
the the city of Topeka Is being oper
ated as economically and in as busi
ness like manner under commission
government as Dayton is being oper
ated under the latest scheme for mu
nicipal government.

Notice was received at the local of
fice of the Rock Island this morning
that the employes of that road are to
participate in the generefl epidemic of
gift giving which is sweeping the
country.
The Rock Island is giving a raise in
salaries. The raise is effective Jan
uary 1.
The emploves to whom the raise is
granted are those receiving more than
$100 a month, and less than $200 a
month. An increase was announced
last July for the employes receiving I
less than $100, and they do not get
in on the present raise. Apparently
the company believes that a man who j
is receiving more than $200 a month j
doesn't need a raise. ;

There are in Topeka more than 150 1
employes of the Rock Island. Not the
entire number, however, will get the
raise, as some of them received their ;
increases in July with the "under ;

receive more than $200 a month. But I

Washington. Dec. 22. Recovering
slowly from the dizzy whirl of yester
day's history making developments,
government officials and foreign diplo
mats here today looked to the foreign
offices of the belligerent nations for
the next peace move.
As outlined in early reports, strong
exception was at first taken to Presi

spoken exception, seemingly, today has
been toned down, the move now being
called merely "inopportune." The at

show a trend In the same direction.
The administration believes, how
ever, this feeling is not sufficient to
cast any real gloom over the situation.
It appears the same surprise and
wonderment was occasioned in Europe
by the president's overtures- as were
manifest here when his move became
known.

The Kansas Masonic home here was
destroyed by fire early this morning.
The property loss is estimated by the
board of trustees to be $250,000.
There were ninety-two adults and
forty-one children residing in the
home.
The home was the property of the
Masonic lodges of Kansas. The chapel,
valued at $10,000, and the hospital,
valued at $9,000, were the only build
ings saved. The fire started in the
boiler room and had gained great
headway before discovered by passer

sible for the firement to check the
flames. Several thousand gallons of
crude oil, stored in the basement,
added fury to the flames. Two fire

The unfortunate children of Tope
ka will be happy on Christmas day.
Miss Mabel Adams, secretary of the
Confidential Exchange, announced
this afternoon that the contributions
of the good people of the city were
sufficient to care for the immediate
wants and desires of the youngsters
and their parents. In other words,
the poor and needy fathers and moth
ers will not find it necessary to hide
f-om their children the dramatically
effective approach of Christmas morn.
There will be a real honest -to-good-ness
Santa Clau3 sliding down the cold
chimneys of the cottages of the desti
tute. There is just one more favor to ask.
Always, at the last minute, hurried
calls come to the Confidential Ex
change for holiday relief. Miss Adams
.does not want to disappoint anyone
nor do her contributors wish to risk
the realization of a tear stained cheek.
A few more offers of aid to assure
complete relief is all that is needed.
AH the needs reported are cared for.
This new appeal is to care for any
that might have been overlooked or
any that might come in at the eleventh
hour.
After that we'll all be happy!

$100,000 GRAIN
ELEVATOR TO BE
BUILT IN TOPEKA
Prominent Men Thruout State
Are Behind the Plan.
Help to Make Topeka Grain
.Center of Kansas.
TO BUILD m THE NORTH SIDE
Option on Curtis Street Prop
erty Has Been Obtained.
Elevator Will Be at the Service
of General Public.
A quarter million bushel storage
elevator costing $100,000 will be built
a block east of Kansas avenue on
Curtis street In North Topeka, accord
ing to an announcement made thi
morning at the city hall. A representa
tive of prominent grain firms in Kan
sas interested in the project called at
the city hall this morning, making in
quiries1 concerning obtaining a fran
chise for building switching tracks
across Kansas avenue, just north of
the bridge. An option on the land has
already been obtained.
Prominent grain men thruout Kan
sas have already subsfcirbed sufficient
stock and the organization of a cor
poration will be completed 1n a snort
time. E. J. Smiley, secretary of the
Kansas Grain Dealers' association, one
of the most active men in the organi
zation of the company, announced this
morning that a Rock Island engineer
would arrive in Topeka in a few daya
to prepare estimates on switching for
the quarter of a million bushel stor
age house.
Trn ns 1 1 Pr 1 v 1 1 eges.
Transit privileges will be enjoyed
by shippers using the storage elevator.
With transit privileges they can get a
rate on grain from point of shipment
to destination and store it In Topeka
in transit for six months. At the end
of that time or during any time inter
vening they may ship the grain on to
destination for the remainder of the
rate quoted from point of shipment to
destination.
Under the plan which has been in
formation for months, there will be
unloading facilities at the big storage
houses on three railroads, the Rock
Island, Santa Fe and Union Pacific.
That means. Ihere will be no switching
charges for unloading or loading on
any of these three roads.
A Public Elevator.
The storage house will be classified
as a public elevator operated under
the laws of the state. Any shipper in
Kansas may use the elevator for stor
age purposes if there is room at the
time he applies. It is expected that
every mill in Topeka will use the ele
vator as all are short of storage capa
city at various times during the year.
It is in answer to the long felt need
of such a storage house that it was
finally decided to build an elevator
second to none in the state outside of
Wichita and Kansas City, Kan. Then,
too, the realization of grain men in the
state of Topeka's logical location as a
grain and storage center aided fei mak
ing the project reach its present mens
i ure of success. Not only are Topeka
j grain men subscribing stock to the
! concern but well known grain dealers
I mostly in the western part of Kansas,
1 also are doing so.
I Six New Grain Firms.
1 Another proof of Topeka's growing
importance as a grain center was made
! public today when it was announced
j that six prominent grain and com
I mission men are contemplating open
j ing offices in Topeka shortly after a
board of trade is opened. This, prob
; ably will be January 5. The firms
