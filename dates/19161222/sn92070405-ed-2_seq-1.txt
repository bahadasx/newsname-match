The 1015 yield from thig district was the largest in its history, says the
Geological Survey. All the ore was shipped to smelters. The averago assay
per ton for the district in 1015 was gold, 0.1171 ounce, silver 4.0G ounces, and
copper 2.11 per cent. The principal producing mine was the Eighty-flvo.
This company curtailed its production during the early part of 1015 on ac
count of the unsettled condition of the copper market during that period,
but during the later part of tho year shipped tho largest quantity of ore in
Its history. In October this company took over tho property of tho Atwood
Mining Co. In addition to its mining operations, the company did a large
amount of underground development and exploration work with core drills.
Other producing mines were the Atwood, Battleship, Bonnfcy, Carle, Dundee,
Eldorado, Nellie Bly, Ontario, Robert E. Lee, Triangle, nnd Waldo-Bean.
The ore bearing lodes of the district occur as fissures in a Dioritc coun
try lock changing at places to andosite nnd andesite-porphyry. There are
at irregular intervals intrusions', of tho diorite into the andosite. Wherever
these intrusions occur the ore is generally in large quantities and of high
values. The fracturing in the magma, bringing about the fissure veins, has
evidently been tho result of ascending gases and internal eruption. Later,
descending solutions percolating through the silicious vein filling has depos
ited tho mineral. This is more fully verified by the fact that the higher gold
and silver values are ncaror the surface. Thero ha3 been no intricate fault
ing on tho property of tho 85 Mining Company although a slight shearing
has taken place. The dip of tho 85 vein, is 70 degrees southwest and the
strike is north 40 degrees east. The width of tho vein varies from five feet
to fifteen feet and the total values range from ?7 to $15 per ton. The char
acter of the 85 mine ore iá ovldcs, chlorides and sulphides with occasional
high grade chalcocitc pockets occurring as ore shoots in the vein.
Never before in the history of Lordsburg mines has the futuro looked so
promising as at the timo now" at hand. Tho ore shipments from the camp
aro larger than they have ever been; more mines aro in active operation and
better values are being obtained than any of tho old-time mining men of the
southwest remember.
Mining, cattle and farming are Lordsburg's assets. Right now mining
is in the limelight. Witness the progress from the mining section of this
holiday edition of the Liberal. Boost for the Lordsburg mines. Give them
credit for what ,they have done and encourago others to enter the field.

Geology and Ores
The Pyramid range of mountains appears to have had its birth
toward the closo of tho Tertiary. The focal point of dynamical en
ergy was centered about Pyramid Peak, from which the range of
mountains took its name.
The principal eruptions forming the chief country rock is ande
site. This type of rock is general throughout tho range, and fre
quently has a granular and crystaline structure, passing into
nphanitic and fluidal phases.
In the central and northwest part of the mining area tho rocks
are more corasely crystaline, with phenocrysts of feldspar. Somo
carboniferous limestone exists a few miles to tho south and southeast
of Pyramid Peak.
Thore seems to bo two goneral types of veins or zones in and
along which tho metallic volues have segregated:
(1) Truo fissure.
(2) Sheared or shattered zone.
In oither caso tho mineralization is apparently from below; that
is, ascending mineral-bearing solutions of hot wator. In view of this
fact thero can be no question about extremo depth to tho deposits.
Therefore the primary ore exist as sulphides. Tho oxidized oroj
will doubtless continue, in most parts of the region, to a depth of
400 feet, and oven moro in some instances. Subsequent action of
decending oxygenated water has altered the primary sulphides near
the surface and re-deposited tho metallic compounds at greater
depths, forming zones of secondary enrichment. This action has been
general throughout tho region. Closer study of these deposits tends
to the belief that most of tho ores have been dissolved and ro-deposited
many timc3 before reaching their present position, thus receding
in direct ratio an encroachment by erosion advancos.
The economic ores of the region are thoso of copper, silver,
lead and gold; their importance is taken in the order named. In tho
earlier surface mining silver held first place; but in the later deeper
workings most of the values seem to have a general tendency toward
that of copper.
The most favorable aspect of the region is noted in the gradual
enrichment pf the ores at depth. In every property where a depth of
300 feet or more has been reached the ores are uniformly of higher
grade and less silicious in character than in the more shallow work
ings. Stimulated by this fact, those who have the courago and tho
capital to prosecute work at depth need have but little fear of tho
ultimate outcome, provided tho work is intelligently directed.
The Lordsburg region is composed of two districts, viz.: Tho
Pyramid and Virginia.
Pyramid district occupies the country about the base of Pyramid
Peak, while tho Virginia comprises the district farther to the north,
and embraces everything lying between the Pyramid district and the
Southern Pacific tracks.
Concluding Remarks
Taking all in all, the Lordsburg mining region is ono of merit
and well worth the attention of capital seeking mining investments.
The surface showing is splendid. Tho deeper workings aro uniformly
paying properties. An excellent climate, splendid railway facilities,
cheap labor, convenient to smelters are all factors to be desired in
successful mining operations.

The Lordsburg mining region lies immediately south of the
village of Lordsburg and embraces tho low, short tieeert rango of the
Pyramid Mountains. It lies between tho Southern Pacific Railway
on the north and the El Paso and Southwestern system: on tho soatlu
A branch .lino operated by this latter system connects HachiU with
Lordsburg, oxtending northwest to tho great copper camps of Clifton
and Morenci, in Arizona.
