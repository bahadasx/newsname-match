At this eleventh hour, or literally
Rpeaking, on this 22nd day of Decem­
ber, with only one day left to purchase
the merry Christmas gift for the only
girl or the only boy in the world and
you are struggling
with that crowd of
late shoppers in the
downtown district,

enough to drop a
coin into the kettles
—"just to keep the
pots boiling,"—the
words of Captain
James A. Murphy of
the Salvation army.
The shops of the
Capital City are fill­
ed with lovely little trifles that one
can purchase for a hundred or more.
Into the toy sections of the depart­
ment stores one can get a glimpse of
the cosy doll houses big enough for a
live-year-old girl to get into comfort­
ably. It can be purchased for $75.
Then there are miniature touring cars
with everything perfectly lovely and
on a small scale except the price.
But What of the Poor?
But, there are more than 30 poor
families to be fed in the Capital City
next Monday noon and it is to the
holiday shoppers that Captain James
Murphy today Issues his final appeal
to ^keep the pots boiling." Mrs. Mur­
phy, he says, has now completed her
investigations. More contributions
are needed. Personal checks do not
necessarily have to be mailed to the
captlan of the army, but can be drop­
ped into the kettles and will reach the
headquarters just the same and soon­
er than if dropped into the mails.
For the remaining two days, the ket­
tles will remain on the street corners.
$15 Realized Yesterday.
The riaihg 'temperature' of ydstfer
day afternoon-had-a beneficial effect
upon the army kettles. Over $15 was
realized. The' captain' reports that
there is stity more need to care for

London, Dec. 22.—While winter

front to lag in features of interest,
considerable activity is developing in
sectors far enough south to admit of
energtlc campaigning.
On the Tigris, the British, after a

south, and are continuing to atack
the Turkish forces in that region, ev­
idently hoping to resume their long

'Now another field of activity is de­

nouncement by London that British
forces have captured El Arish in
'Egypt, on the Mediterranean, 90
miles east of the Seuz canal.
Little has been heard from the
Egyptian operations for some time
but the British are known to have
been making somewhat elaborate
preparation to protect the canal re
gion from further incursion, such as
that of last summer, and their de
fensive lines have been pushed far
out on the Sinai peninsula. Appar­
ently there has been a recent effort
still further to extend the defensive
scone, of which the capture of El Ar
ish constitutes an important devel

and changed their pleas from guilty to
not guilty and asked Judge Nuessle,

acquiesce, stating that to do so would
provide for the imposing of a fine for
a felony and believing that the young

their own cognizance.
He requested that the mother ap­

Means Strife Between United
States and Great Britain
BECOMES BITTER.
London, Dec. 22.—The more
England digests the Wilson
peace note, the more bitter she
feels toward America for what
she considers the first step in in­
tervention in the war. This be­
came apparent this afternoon
from the afternoon paper editori­
al comment.
(United Press)
London, Dec. 22.—The government's
wisdom in permitting President Wil­
son's pface note to soak 24 hours be­
fore permitting its publication became
apparent today. Such a restriction
saved the torrent of bitter resentment
toward America. The press today,
however, was unanimous in deploring
the action of President Wilson.
Bitter Resentment.
Comments ranged from pained stir
prises at the action to bitter resent­
ment for the deed. This resentment,
however, was not so bitter as it would
have bieen had the note been immed­
iately published.
Demonstrating that, was the com­
ment of one editor before the note
was published, saying:
"This means strife between the
United States and England. It is the
worst possible blow to the Allies."
That editor was silent today.
iNo Statement Yet.
The British government will make
no statement at present in regard to
President Wilson's peace note, con­
sidering it a question that can be
dealt with only in communication
with the other members of the En­
tente. This was announced in the
house of commons today by Bonar
Law.
"It must bo obvious tihat It is a
question that can only be dealt with
in communication with our allies, and
that it is absolutely impossible to
make a statement now," he said.
A dispatch from The Hague says
it. is announced semiofficially that
should the Entente Allies, in their re­
ply to the peace proposal of the Cen­
tral Powers leave the door open for
negotiations, Germany will make
known her chief peace terms only.
AN INTERLOCUTOR.
Edinburgh, Dec. 22.—President Wil­
son is declared to have placed him­
self in a position of an interlocutor
on the side of Germany, by the Scots­
man, which in an editorial comment­
ing on the president's note, says:
"President Wilson has hitherto ob­
served a reticence which he maintain­
ed when the small nations he is now
so concerned about were suffering un­
paralleled wrong."
"What motive can have prompted
him to throw aside that peculiarly
prudent reserve just at a moment
when his action was most likely to be
misunderstood? It is strange that no
one among his counsellors had the
wit to see the intervention at this
juncture immediately following the
maneuvers of Berlin and before the
Entente powers had time to deal for­
mally with that movement, run the
extreme risk of being misconstrued."
BERLIN RECEIVES NOTE.

Washington, Dec. 22.—Recovering
from yesterday's history making
events, officials here today looked to
European belligerents for* the next
peace move. They noted with satis­
faction that the trend of comment
from Europe following the president's
note had toned down considerably to­
day. Even diplomatic circles here
today had softened the trend of their
comment.
No Real Gloom.
No real gloom pervaded official cir­
cles, today in view of the recent bit­
ter European comment on the note.
On the other hand, it was pointed out
that accurate soundings on the Euro­
pean governments' overtures on Wil
son's note would not be known for
several days. At that time, it was be­
lieved in official circles, a responsive
chord will have been found in Euro­
pean countries.
Considerable Confusion.
Just what lays behindT Secretary
Lansing's two announcements of yes­
terday, one qualifying the other, ia
not known here today. Officials and
diplomats here had n^tchpd thqp$.
conclusions .however:
President Wilson has made the first
step in what may be a more vigorous
step looking toward peace.
He has warned all belligerents that
they must not take any action In a
final desperate blow to bring about
peace on their terms, which would lot
peril the best interests of the United,
JStates.
Lansing's Statements.
Early yesterday Secretary Lansing
said:
"I mean by that (referring to a
statement regarding President Wil­
son's note to the belligerents), that
we are drawing near the verge of war
ourselves, and, therefore, we are en­
titled to know exactly what each bel­
ligerent seeks in order that we may
regulate our conduct in the future."
After a conference with President
Wilson, later in the day, Lansing
said: "I have learned from several
quarters that a wrong Impression was
made by the statement I made this
morning. did not intend to inti­
mate that the government was con­
sidering any change in its policy of
neutrality which it has consistently
pursued in the face of constantly in­
creasing difficulties."
Diplomats in Washington were as­
tounded by statements made by Lan­
sing yesterday.

TO CONSIDER IT.
Washington, Dec. 22.—For the
very same reason that England
and her allies did not flatly turn
down the German peace proposals,
they will not flatly turn
down
President Wilson's peace sugges­
tion.
This was confidently stated by
a high diplomatic official here to
the United Press today.
England, it was said, does net
care officially and formally to re*
Ject Wilson's suggestion because
such an action would play Into
Germany's hands, since Germany
has reiterated her frequent state*
ments that the Entente allies are
responsible for prolonging the
war.
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 22.—With the pur*
pose of President Wilson's note to the
belligerents clarified by official state­
ments on the subject, the attention of
the United States has turned to the re­
ception of the note in the foreign capi­
tals.
Eagerly Watching.
Diplomats here are eagerly watch
ing for indications of whether t|ie
European neutrals will follow the le*d
of the United States and make a sim­
ilar appeal to the warring powers.
There is a growing feeling that the
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for .views, and possibly
for terms of the belligerents. Several
of the diplomats have advised their
government to that effect in order to
guide them In their replies.
Are Surprised.
Surprise at the fast growing stgaM*
cance of the president's move' IS ex­
pressed on all sides, which pblfit oit
that at first the opinion prevailed that
the note itself was merely a "feeler,"
and that the most immediately con­
templated effect was the receipt ot
some sort of delineation from the var­
ious warring nations. That the presi­
dent should let it be known indirectly
to the diplomats for their guidance
that he went even further than that,
and counted on an absolutely frank
reply from the belligerents which
should lead to an actual opening for
negotiations, proved only less surpris­
ing than the actual note itself.
Not Pro-German Move.
Indications that Entente diplomats
would advise their governments to re­
ply to the president's note in a friend­
ly spirit proved a source of gratifica­
tion today, as it was pointed out both
in the note Itself and in Secretary
Lansing's explanation that one of the
dangers was that the Allies would con­
strue the step as a pro-German move.
Every effort was made to remove this
impression.
Secretary Lansing's two statements.
Issued yesterday, were today forward­
ed to American diplomatic representa­
tives in European nations.
Free Hand.
The president is to have a free hand
in his peace negotiations with bellig­
erent powers, according to congres­
sional action today. Both houses today
refused to take any action in his re­
cent peace move, until after the holi­
days at least.
Representative Bailey, Pennsylva­
nia, today introduced a resolution into
the house, calling upon that body to Im­
mediately endorse and approve the
president's action In sending a peace
note to belligerent nations.

hether the president ever has heard
