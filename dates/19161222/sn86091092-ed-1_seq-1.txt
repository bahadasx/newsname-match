The
with
of
for
and
The outlook, from a building stand
point, for the year 1917 in Caldwell, is
very bright. The indications are that
this will be one of the really big years
in the history of this community. For
several years buildings has been at a
standstill in this community. This era
has passed. More buildings are needed.
Business establishments in the city
need bigger quarters and new busi
ness houses are coming in. There is
ample money in the country to finance
any improvements that are .needed and
that will pay dividends on the invest
ment.
Biggest Improvement.
The improvements which the Cald
well Milling & Elevator company will
make, announcement of which ap
peared exclusively in The Tribune of
last week, are the most important
which have been made public. The
company will cxpond upwards of
$100.000.00 in the erection of a new
200,000 bushel grain elevatoi 4 , new
warehouse and new railroad swtiching
facilities. .
The additions to the plant will give
Caldwell the greatest, most conven
iently arranged and most modern
grain plant on the Oregon Short Line.
Grain from all sections will be shipped
to Caldwell, graded, weighed and, such
of it as is not manufactured into flour
here, will be reloaded.
The additional work which the plans
of the mill will necessitate will give
employment to a much larger force
at the plant of Caldwell's greatest
manufacturing concern.
New Implement House.
Work is already under way oil the
new 75x120 implement house, automo
bile distributing plant and garage of
Messrs. Heath Bros. This building is
now in course of construction by Mr,
Von Wasmer and will be ready for
occupancy within a few weeks.
Messrs. Heath Bros, will carry :
complete line of implements in ad
dition to their automobiles_ and acces
sories. This is a new business house
for the community.
The addition to the Shank garage is
moving along rapidly. This company
recently increased its capital stock to
$100.000.00. The new addition will
give the comoany one of the largest
garages and disnlay rooms in the state
Cheese Factory.
The Caldwell cheese factory, located
located in the Caldwell Ice Si Cold
Storage building, will soon need more
room and we understand that Mr
Martin Jensen has under considéra
tion an extensive addition to his plan
in order to accommodate the growing
business of the cheese factory.
The cheese making industry has a
great future in this section. There are
at present four prosperous, growing
factories in Canyon county. These
factories must be enlarged within a
short time, and other factories will un
questionably be established during the
next year or two.
Many New Residences.
A great many private dwellinu
houses will be erected ill Caldwell
during the comini? vear. Last sprine
considerable building activity started
but was stopped owing to the liiuh
cost of buildins material. Building
material is now low in price and many
ne whouses, additions to old houses
and other improvements, long contem
plated, will be built this coining year,

BUSINESS MEN REPORT
SPLENDID HOLIDAY TRADE
People Are Buying More Expensive
Christmas Gifts This Year.
The merchants of Caldwell report a
splendid holiday trade this year.
Every one of them has had a trade
much better than last year. People
generally are buying higher class and
more expensive stuff and paying cash.
The business houses arc well pleased
with this year's holiday trade.
The jewelry houses report a heavy
demand for the larger and more ex
pensive diamonds. Expensive jewelry
of all kinds is in great demand. Other
stores catering particularly to the
Chirtmas trade say that the demand
for expensive toys is unusually heavy.
The dry goods stores report good
demands for furs, suits and cloaks,
and fine wearing apparel of all
kinds.
RUBY SAYS DEMOCRATIC
DAILY IS SURE GO
Democrats Are Raising Money for
Venture Without Trouble.
D. G. Ruby, Democratic leader of
Canyon County, states that the Demo
crats will establish a daily newspaper
at Boise within the next few months.
He says that there is no trouble about
raising the money. Every man who
has been approachd has expressed
his willingness to subscribe for stock,
support the newspaper after it is es
tablished and secure the support of his
friends.
Mr. Ruby and associate are working
through the state and county organi
zations. The Democrats are expected
to take hold at once by selling stock,
securing subscriptions to the paper
and otherwise helping with the en
terprise.
$100,000.00 to Be Raised.
Mr. Rubv says that at least $100,000
will be raised at once in cash. This,
it is thought, will purchase the plant
and equipment. Money will be forth
coming in sufficient quantities to pay
the paper's way until it becomes self
supporting.
"The Democrats are enthusiastic,"
said Mr. Ruby to a representative of
The Tribune Wednesday. "I have
never known the time when they were
so willing to go into a thing of this
kind as they are today. There will be
no trouble in raising the money. Every
organization of Democrats in the state
will get behind the project and boost
it to success.
If the Republicans can support two
newspapers at the state capital the
Democrats can support one.
Support Strong.
There will be plenty of support.
We can estimate a circulation of 20,000
to start with. This circulation will be
secured and paid for a year in ad
vance before we turn a wheel in get
ting out the newspaper. The adver
tising will naturally come from all
sources regardless of politics to ^the
newspaper that has the circulation.
Mr. Ruby and associates are hard at
work. They expect to begin the pub
lication of the organ within a reason
able length of time.

The shop early, mail early slogan
has sounded so long and so insistent
ly that it has gradually crystalizcd in
to action according to shop-keepers

force of unhappy experiences by tardy

$800 as against $550 last year. Where

Attendance of Every Water User on
Boise Project is Strongly Urged—
Next Board Will Make Fight for
Reduced Water—Important That
Men Who Fell Right Be

of
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Boise Water Users'
association will be held in this city
Monday, January 8th. An entirely
new board of directors will be elcctcd
and other business of the greatest im
portance transacted. Every water user
should make it a point to attend this
meeting. In case he cannot attend in
person his proxy should be given to
some one who will represent him
faithfully.
The present board of directors, un
der the leadership of President C. M.
Keim, has started the proceedings
which will result in a considerable re
duction in the cost of water to the
water users. The move started by
Mr. Keim and associates must be con
tinued and it is important that direc
tors, who stand on record as having at
heart the welfare of the settlers, be
elected members of the board. Every
man who desires to become a member
of the board should be placed squarely
on record in favor of making the fight
that has been started. Any man who
is opposed to asking for the rights of
the settlers should be defeated without
parley.

Position of Board.
The present board of directors con
sists of President Keim, Messrs. L. J.
MaGee, A. C. Johnson, E. Jordan, C.
M. Rankin, J. W. Brandt, C. F. Oellien,
Wm. Woods, D. R. Hubbard, D. R.
Sparks and Sam Hunt.
Messrs. Keim, MaGee, Johnson,
Jordan, Rankin and Brandt are out
spoken in favor of the fight for re
duced water. These men, with the ex
ception! of Mr. Brandt, who cannot be
re-elected on account of disqualifica
tions, should be re-elected without fail.
With them should be elected men who
arc in harmony with them. The en
tire organization of the association
should be as one man.
The fight has been inaugurated and
should be carried to a successful con
clusion. The board has employed for
mer Governor Hawley to look out for
the interests of the settlers and to
present the matter before congression
al committees. Governor Hawley will
work with the entire Idaho delegation
in congress. He feels that the fight
can be won. He now needs the hearty
support of every settler on the project
and a sympathetic board of directors,
No District Now.
The members of the board who arc
right on this issue are opposed to the
organization of an irrigation district
at this time. The settlers arc opposed
to the proposed district and they
should retain as directors men who arc
konwn to stand right on the district
proposition.
Attend the Meeting.
The Tribune, realizing the import
ance of the meeting, urges every set
tied to be in attendance in person
The most important matter that will
come before any settler on the Boise
project during the next tin years will
he the election of the new board of
directors. No water user should fa
attend. In case attendance is im
possible give your proxy to some one
who is known to be right.
The Tribune will discuss the Boise
projcct matter somewhat at length
during the present and next two issues
of the paper. We simply wish to point
out the importance of taking the right
stand at the present time.

EUROPE TO DISCUSS
PEACE TERMS
URGES BELLIGERENTS TO
OUTLINE BASIS UPON
WHICH THEY WOULD
TREAT FOR PEACE
AND END THE
WAR.
Official Washington Surprised at
Move Especially in View of Attitude
of England. France and Russia—
Entente Had Hinted That Peace
Offer Would be Considered Un
friendly—Germany Pleased With
Suggestion.
President Wilson has appealed to
all the belligerents to discuss terms of
peace.
Without actually proposing peace or
offering mediation, the president has
sent formal notes to the governments
of all the warring nations suggesting
that "an early occasion be sought to
call out from the nations now at war
such an avowal of ther respective
views to the terms upon which the war
might be concluded and the arrange
ments which would be deemed satis
factory as a guarantee aganst its re
newal or the kindling of any similar
conflict in the future, as would make
it possible frankly to compare them."
Gave No Notice of His Plan.
Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration offi
cials have described as hs course, the
president Tuesday night dispatched
the notes to all the belligerents, and
all the neutrals for their informa
tion. Summarized in the president's
words as contained in the notes,
ttitude is as follows
The president is not proposing
peace; lie is not even offering media
tion. He is merely proposing that
soundings be taken in order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with
the belligerents, how near the heaven
of peace may be for which all man
kind longs with an intense and in
creasing longing.
He believes that the spirit in which
... speaks and the objects which he
seeks will be understood by all con
cerned, and he confidently hopes for a
response which will bring a new light
into the affairs of the world.
This latest development in the
rapidly moving world events toward
a discussion of peace was not per
mitted to become known until Wed
nesday night when the notes were
well on their way to the American
ambassadors in the belligerent capi
tals and probably already in the hands
some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to all
official Washington, which had been
led to believe that with the formal
transmittal of the proposals of the
central powers the offices of the
United States would await further
moves between the belligerents them
selves, and that certainly, in view of
the speech of Premier Lloyd-George
and the announcements in Russia,
France and Italy, further action by
neutrals would depend upon the next
careful and delicate moves of the
belligerents.
The whole tenor of otficial opin
ion throughout Washington, when the
president's action became known,
as that it immeasurably improved
the prospects for some sort of ex
change looking toward an approach
to peace discussions between the bel
ligerents without impairing the posi
tion of the United States should they
finally be unable to find a good
ground on
other.
Germany Embassy Pleased.
The German embassy view of Presi
dent Wilson's surprising move in con
nection with the peace proposals, was
expressed in this authorized statement
by Count Bernstorff, the German am
bassador: ,
'Now,"' said he, "I am perfectly
convinced that there will be a confer
e l The nearest parallel in world his
tory for President Wilson's action was
President Roosevelt's move in 1905 to
end the war between Russia and Ja
pan. But in that case the president
had been assured his proposal would
not be disagreeable to either of the
belligerents, and, curiously enough, it
was through Emperor William of Ger
any that the preliminary soundings
crystalized into the suggestion that
President Roocsevelt take the steps.
Before that time President Roose
velt had conferred with Count Cas
sini the Russian ambassador here,
and' with Mr. Takahira, the Japanese
minister. In the Russian capital the
American ambassador, George von L.
Meyer, had conversations with Count
Lamsdorff. the Russian minister for
foreign affairs.
Guarded Against Rejection.
In Tokio, American Minister Gris
com had conversations with Count
Komura, the Japanese minister for
foreign affairs. The outcomc of all
these preliminaries was that Presi
dent Roosevelt was assured that he
would not be humiliated by a rejec
tion of his action.
Those in official circles who would
discuss the notes thought it worthy of
attention that President Wilson, after
saying his action had long been in
mind, added:
"The president can only beg that his
suggestion be considered entirely on
its own merits and as if it had been
made in other circumstances."
The objects which the belligerents
have in mind, the president pointed
out, are virtually the same as stated in
general terms to their people and to
the world, but yet the concrete objects
of the war "have never been defini
tely stated."

The high school football team has

appreciation of their prowess in the
athletic field during the past season
but it remained for the business men
of their home city, through the med
ium of the Commercial club, to crown
this wholesale approval with a tan

assumed the form of handsome sweat
ers in the high school athletic colors—
old gold and blue—the blue of the
startling big "C" making an effective
contrast against the body of the gar
ment in gold.
About 200 guests gathered Tuesday
in the Commercial Club rooms to wit

Senator Chamberlain and Congress
man Smith Hnve Worked Out Plan
—Bill is Now Before Two Houses
of Congress—Great Relief for West
If It Carries and Is Approved—Sale
of Bonds Would Be Easy Matter
With Uncle Sam Back of Them.
The proposed law which Represen
tee Smith of Idaho and Senator
Chamberlain of Oregon have in mind
may open the way for financing of the
great irrigation projects of the west.
The proposed law might materially
help the Black Canyon Irrigation Dis
rict. The law provides that the Uni
ted States government guarantee ir
rigation district bonds.
The bill introduced in the senate
Wednesday by Senator Chamberlain
uid in the house yesterday by Repre
sentative Smith proposes a new plan
under which the United States may
guarantee both the principal and in
terest on bonds issued by reclamation
districts and thus provide funds for
the construction not only of irrigation
nit drainage projects in several states.
Under the bill, when a project is
approved by the secretary of the in
eiior, a reclamation district organ
zed under state law may issue bonds
to cover the cost of construction and
liesc bonds will be deposited in the
're.'.sury. The secretary of the treas
ury will then issue certificates of in
debtedness equal to the amount of the
district bonds filed with him, and
from the sale of these certificates
noney will be raised to irrigate or
lrain lands in the approved districts.
The work of reclaiming is to be
done under the United States recla
mation service.
The bill contains numerous safe
guards to protect the United States
against loss, and authorizes the for
feituie of lands on which payments
are not made, such lands to be re
sold. Public lands embraced in any
such district arc to be appraised and
sold a auction after the work of ré
clamation is completed.
