VOLUME XLVII; NUMBER
II Enlargement Is
Planned By Nevada-Utah
II. R. Van Wagenen, president of
the Amalgamated IMoche Minea &
Smelt rs corporation, and family,
departed Wednesday for Denver
where they will remain over Christ
mas with Mrs. Whitmore, Mrs. Van
Wagenen'a mother. After Christ
mas, Mr. and Mrs. Van Wagenen will
go on to New York, where the former
goes to meet with the eastern officers
of the company, and Mr. Rogers,
consulting engineer, at which time
plans will be outlined for next year's
campaign. Among the matters to be
discussed will be development, power
and enlargement of the mill. During
the absence of the president, S. F.
Whitney, will be In active charge of
the Amalgamated and kindred In
terests. . The Record learns from Mr. Van
Wagenen that the mill continues to
do excellent work and that the ore
now coming from the mine is of a
splendid grade. The shipments from
the Amalgamated properties during
tlie month of December, which in
cludes the zinc, iron and lead con
centrate; and the crude ore will ap
proximate 650 tons, which is above
the average in the past.
After consulting with the county
commissioners, the Amalgamated
has decided to repair the old Ray
mond & Ely waste pipe line through
the main street of Pioche. The work
of excavating lias already begun and
it is'iexpected that the line will be
Installed within the next few weeks
and the complaint of water running
at large through the street entirely
overcome. The old pipe line has
been continually breaking, notwith
standing the many attempts to re
pair it,, but it has been in the ground
for many years and appears to have
outlived its usefulness. , The new
pipe to be laid is 8-inches in diam
eter and the management feels pos
itive that it will take care of all the
overflow from the mine and mill in
the future.
Mr. Van Wagenen expects to re
turn to Pioche about the middle of
January; but Mrs. Van Wagenen and
children and Mrs Whitmore, will go
on to La Jolla, 'California, where
they will spend the winter.
TO BETTER IlEARIXO
LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS
CLARK CO. ASSEMBLYMEN
ARE FOR PROHIBITION
BIG CHANGE PLANNED
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
Radical reorganization of the
school system of Nevada is recom
mendod in a report drawn up by the
Educational Survey commission at
Carson City tills week and which will
be submitted to the legislature for
adoption, providing several members
of the commission absent at this
week's meeting also approve of the
plan. ,
The commission members who
.were present were Governor - B-le;
Prof. J. E. Bray, state superintend
ent of schools; Prof. J. W. Hunting,
Judge J. F. Langwith, Dr. George
F. James, executive secretary, and
Mrs.' Harvey Edwards, official report-
the Carson City
e.r, according to
Daily Appeal.
The recommendations inc'ude the
direct appointment of the dis
trict school supervisors by tha coan
ty board of education, rather than
to have him appointed as now by the
Mate superintendent. ThU feature
of the school system has been fought
back and forth for a long period
Following are tluy recommenda
tions and report.
ihat the present stato board of
education be abolished and in lieu
theieof a state board consisting of
five members to be appoint-rl by tli
governor created
That the superintendent of public
Instruction bo made un appointive
r filter, the appointing power resting
with the state board ot education
I'.owever, since this otHcc is u' con
stitutional office, it w'll take six
years to put this thing Into effect, In
the event that the legislature ap-
l roves the recommendaiio.
That the prfent system of school
cistrlct supervision be abol-shed and.
I:i lieu thereof, that the county unit
pinu be adopted. In -du-t. this plfm
sMiitemplates .he admit 1st ration 0f
,-crool affairs within eic:i county by
n unty boaid of edu:aa lo i elected
i v the people. In lien or the school
tfi'stec; abolished by this plan, the
unty board will appoint school dis
trict tigents to represent the various
Bchool dlsLlcts. Districts of the first
class that U to say, all districts em
ploying more than 10 teachers are
eliminated from the jurisdiction of
the county board, although given an
opportunity to come under the juris
diction of the county bord by pop
ular vote of the district affected. This
leaves the larger centers under ex
actly the same form of school admin
istration as at the present time.
That the present system of school
supervision be radically changed, as
follows:
That each county board of educa
tion appoints its own county super
visor, who ,may be: ".
(a) A county supervisor of schools
who will devote all of his time to
such work; or
(b The principal of the county
high school; or
(c) The superintendent of a school
district of the first class within such
county.
Provision was made for the con
solldation of two or more counties
Into supervision districts, the super
vision in both or all of the counties
to be done by one person to be ap
pointed by the joint board of the
said counties.
That in order to bring the central
state authority and the local super
visory and administrative authority
into better relations, and into closer
touch, a commission be created to be
known as the Nevada School Super
visory commission, to be composed
of the members of the board of edu
cation, the superintendent 'of . public
instruction, the supervisors of the
various counties, all of whom aro to
meet as a commission at least once
a year for the purpose of determin
ing on the school policy of the state,
of establishing and purchasing text
books, and of adopting the courses
-.if study. It was supposed the cost
of this supervisory work should be
borne jointly by the state and the
counties.
Serious work has been done look
ing to a better system of apportion
ing state school moneys to the vari
ous counties and districts of the
state, and of providing better an J
more equitable systems of finance
for the school system In general, but
the committee having this in charge
was not prepared to report at the
time of the meeting, and the matter
was carried over to the next meeting
Albert B. Mann and C. L. Deming
of the II. W. Jones-Manville com
pany of San Francisco, who have the
contract for Improving the acoustic
properties In the senate and assem
bly chambers of the state capitoi ar
rived today and will proceed at once
with their work. The manner of re
ducing and eliminating revebera
tions in public halls is an interesting
study. Heretofore It lias been par
tially accomplished by wires which
have proved unsatisfactory, besides
being unsightly.
The method used by the above
company Is what Is known as sound
absorption and consists In the plac
ing of hair felting one inch thick
on the celling, covering it entirely;
then what might be termed strips are
tacked on in such a manner as to
form spuares. The entire ceiling, af
ter being treated in this manner, is
covered with a thin muslin or sort
of thin canvas that is light and tough
and by this means the theory of ab
sorption of sound is put into prac
tical use. Scientiflcj re8erch has
proved that the only way to solve the
acoustical problem is to absorb the
sound. The improvement will not
deface the ceiling of either of the
chambers and when completed one
would not know that a practically
new ceiling had been put in. About
three weeks will be required to com
plete this work and the cost will be
in the neighborhood of $1,800.- Car
son Appeal.
PETITIONS CONTINUE
TO ARRIVE AT
CAPITOL
The .total number of names on the
petitions of prohibition, anti-gambling
and divorco was tabulated in the
office of the secretary of state this
morning. The prohibition petitious
contain 7,821 names, or more than
double the number required by law;
ie petition for changing the divorce
law from six mouths to I year's rew-
dence, 2,002, and the anti-gamb-
ng petition, 2,148. The divorce pe
tition contains 207 and the anti-
gambling 115 names ttiat are classed
doubtful on account of the party
making affidavit failing to sign tho
petition. The law requires that there
shall be -not loss than 3,083 names
on each petition, that being 10 per
cent of the vote cast for supreme
udge at the last election, which to
taled 30,822 votes.
More petitions are expected to ar-
ive today, but it does not look as
though either ttie anti-gambling or
divorce petitions will have sufficient
names to be considered as the refer-
ndum provides. Tlte prohibition
petition is absolutely safe with plen
ty of names to spare. Carson Ap

A majority at least of Clark coun
ty's legislative representatives will
take a decided staud in the coming
session beginning January 15 in fa
vor of prohibition and anti-gambling
action by the lawmakers.
Both E. W. Griffith and Frank
Williams, assemblymen, Save mado
public their intention to work for
prohibition and anti-gambling meas
ures. Senator Peter Buol could not
bo located this week, and so it is Im
possible to say Just how he will stand
on these great economic and moral
measures, but it is known that Mr.
Buol has changed a great deal in his
outlook upon gambling legislation
since the last session of the logisla
ture when he supported race track
and other gambling bills. Manv C
his best friends believe that he wil'
not be deaf to the appeals of workerr
for better things for Nevada.
Griffith yesterday told the Clark
County Review that he would not
oniy support prohibition and anti
gambling moves, but would favor the
passage of a prohibition statute at
the coming session instead of setting
a date for an election on the subject
two years away. "Of course," he said,
"such a measure would not provide
immediate prohibition but would give
the liquor men a year to leave the
business, according to tho policy of
the states.
"I am for prohibition and anti
gambling laws," said Mr. Griffith,
"and I don't mind making that fact
public. I have nothing to hide. And?
besides that, I am for stopping ex
travagance in the state. It has been
said that the northern legislators
formed a ring which it is impossible
o break through and that they carry
hat they like, but I believe that a
good fight will accomplish things.
and I intend to make that fight."
Certain of the northern newspa
pers have stated that the coming lcg-
slature was a "liberal" one as usual,
ut it is -believed that tho wish is
father to their thought in this respect
nd that the newspapers are trying
to create tho Impression that the
legislature is liberal, so to discour
age the efforts of reform men and
women to stop the kind of "liberal
ism" that the state has had a sample
of since the last session.
Sentiment is changing so rapidly
Uiroughout the United States that it
is impossible that it should not reach
Nevada and overthrow tho hold
which tho Bo-called advocates of
loose living have upon the state leg-
slature and upon the electorate. Evi
dences that the nation-wide move
ment has reached Nevada are in
creasing dailv.
