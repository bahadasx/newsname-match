A Childish Attit
ft
i
"I" HERE is difference of
regarding the moral nec
Judge DoyUs opinion
the wines of our police court.
Granted that the state constitution
provides a jury trial for every person
accused of a violation of the penal
code, we must face the fact that in prac
tically every state in the union, police
court judges sentence hundreds of men
every year. We also know that there
are dead provisions in many state con
stitutions.
Justice is also mud stained in some
of these primary courts where crush
of cases makes speed and quick judg
ment essential. Undoubtedly cases
have been "railroaded" through the Ok
lahoma City police court.
" The transfer of the trial of all petty
cases to the jury system will throw thv
county court machine into the lowest
gear and double the expense to the
community.
Mayor Overholser has honestly tried
to clean up Oklahoma City, the Timet
believes. Therefore there is some basi-.
for the piiue that he shows when his
hands, in his view, are tied by those
higher up.
But our point is, that Mayor Kd can
not afford to be stubborn in such a
serious situation. It teems to us that
he decided he would be obeying the let
ter of the mandate, if not the spirit, by
ipening the jail doots and turning loose
a gang of vagrants upon the citizens of
Oklahoma City.
We believe Mayor Overholser decided
"to go tire route" with Judge Doyle.
Now Judge Doyle is bound to enforce
the constitution, lie represents the
highest legal authority in this state
and every effort of the criminal court
to clean up court procedure should be
met with an effort toward co-operation
Would it not have been in keeping
with Mayor Overholser's record of
good works if he had informed., the
county authorities that he intended to
open the doors of the city jail, so the
county might have had a chance to
keep ruffians away from Christmas
plunder?
Mayor Overholser does not hit Judge
Doyle when he tarns loose flock of
lawbreakers. It is the citizenry of Ok
lahoma City that he hits, the people
who put him where he is to work every
minute for their best Interests.
Without Agreeing that Judge Doyle's
decision was absolutely necessary, the
Times insists Mayor Ed's action was
childish.

KANSAS CITY. Mo. Dec. 22.-De-
velopmenls today in the investigation
of the mysterious death of Arthur B.
Sim, wealthy oil man of Wichita, Kan.,
resulted in the police and county
firoseculor they had tightened an al?
eged web of evidence against two per
sons who, had been in Sim's company
the night before his crushed body was
found under the inter-city viaduct
Tuesday morning.
Chauffeur Heard Conversation.
The announcement was made by
Floyd E. Jacobs, the prosecutor, that
he had obtained a statement from an
unnamed chauffeur who said he had
seen a man and a woman who had
been with Sim drive up to a hotel about
1 :3tt o'clock the morning the body was
found at about the time police believe
the oil man died. The statement was
that the two divided some money, and
the woman, before entering the hotel,
said "Keep mum."
Edna Miller, who told the police she
visited several cafes and hotels with
Sim; Harry Filipatrick. a chauffeur,
and Joe Macoluso, husband of Ella
Miller, all of whom have been held
by the police, were taken from police
headnuarters to the prosecutor's office
today.
Natural Death Theory.
Belief thai Arthur B. Sim, wealthv
oil man of Wichita, Kan, found dead
beneath the inter-city viaduct Tuesday
morning, died a natural death from
heart disease, and his companions
threw him from the viaduct in their
fear of being found with a dead man
"on their hands." was announced bv

LONDON. Dec U -The Britsh gov
ernment will make no statement at
present in regard to President Wil
son's peace note considering it a ques
tion that can be dealt with only in
communication with the other member
of the entente. Announcement to this
effect was made in the house of com
mons today by Andrew Bonar Law,
chancellor of the exchequer and gov
ernment leader in the house.
, Reply of Law.
Mr. Law was asked whether a state
ment could be made regarding th '
American note. He replied:
"It must be obvious to the house that
this is a question that can only b
dealt with in communication with our
allies and that it is absolutely imposaU
tile to make a statement now."
Attitude of Public.
The general puhlic had its first newt
of President Wilson's note from th
morning papers. The matter was the one '
topic of conversation on incoming su
burban trains and throughout the
country. The people, like the press.
were rather taken aback as they had
about arrived at the conclusion that
Premier Lloyd George's speech had put
an end to all peace talk unless the cen
tral powers in their reply to the pre
mier, were prepared to define their
terms. That the president, or any other
neutral country, would take any action
was furthest from their mind.
Other evening papers which do nof
print editorials, came out with big head
lines which expressed their views. The
Evening News, which is the afternoon
edition of the Daily Mail, heads a re
print of the comment of the morning
papers with the one word "No" in large
black type and under it "our answer to)
President Wilson," and again "No, No,
No I That is the answer Great Britain
gives today without a moment's hesi
tation to the surprising note of Presi
dent Wilson." i
Editorial in Goardiaa.
The Manchester Guardian in an edi
torial on President Wilson's note, say
the German people are kept quiet only
by assertions that England intends the)
utter destruction of their country. Thi
is untrue and the sooner the truth i
conveyed to the German people thai
better chance of laving civilisation from
an indefinite continuance of the car
"If this were done the government
would occupy a very strong position
in replying to the American note. Tha
Guardian contends that Great Britain
has done her part indicating her viewa
and that it is now up to Germany t
say what she has to propose."
