7iLL ROBINSON SAYS
THERE IS ADD
PROVES IT
Will Robinson, editor 'f the Roa
well News, hut. actually written a
book and it U a neat and a full
of meat ai any book of IU aia on
earth, for It ia a coronation of all
the frood thinira Mr. tVlllifred hat
ever printed in tha many newspaper
ha edited. It ia nT"ed "Impressions
of a Tenderfoot". Mr. Rob aaya it
ia a "little colL-.ion of proie my
friends have been kind enough to say
is esa rotten than the usual run.
Being that it . so near Chriatmas
It may not be unappropriate to rteal
a little on Santa Ciaua from his book,
llore it is:
"Kt thla time of tha year another
iconoclast ia walking abroad in the
land, coming like a thief In the night
to strike at one of the aacred charac
ters of Childhood, a concrete repre-at-.tation
of the love of parenthood,
ar. i a direct application of the saying
of that prest teacher whose "Suffer
children to come unto me and
f. rbld them not, for auch ia the king
dom," has lived two thouHand years
and triumphed over men-made taws
and selfish customs.
"Tha man who trina to teach that
thre la no such a personage aa Santa
Claua is a full cousin to the man who
triea to teach us that there la ni
Crriet. that the etory of the nativity
and of Cavalry and of the Crasa and
of Hia constant presence with ua, ia
a joke, a canard, a miserable auper--Mtioue
lie. The first man would rob
childhood of one of it dearest faiths.
The latter would take from man the
most precious legacy of the ages,
wipe out his hope of life where there
are running fountains, a place when
there Is neither hunger nor want or
heartache. All too soon does the child
become the man ml to ----ian. an. I
finds out that which Is consecrated
nyth and that which ia sordid and
oftm miserable fact. Too often do s
the mature man get warped in nt
mental alats, and como to believe
that when the change we call death
comes there is naught but darkness,
tint all our effort and struggles to
cultivate the mind, and to make others
happy, are without permnnmt value.
These Iconoclastic brothers are the
modernafriends. They should have no
quarter in the homes of tha greatest
ration, whose voung are certain to
help in the building of the greatest
commonwealth, the greatest civilisa
tion and the most perfect happiness
the world has known.
"Place your children right, on this
Santa Claua business. beloved.
TIIL'RE 13 A SANTA CLAUS- Idl
ing a period of time in which empire
rave risen. only to fall, during which
the lost places of the earth have been
lit up with the ureal intelligence,
during which the wisdom and gouti
ness of God huve been evident every
minute. Sunta Claus has been romlnc:
down from the north and scattering
hia largesa. Whenever ho comes,
there you will find love the only
thing that makes life worth living.
Where this guiding beacon shines not
from the fireside you wilL find nu
stockings hanging, you wiw see no
gleam of candles from gift-laden
trees. lie absolutely will not go in
to a home where the people ara not
e little children and do not lova one
another.
"Santa Claus usually cornea Just as
he ha been painted on myriad can
vas and described in numWrless child
tules. That ia with a sled full of toys
nnd troo.lies. drawn by six reindeer.
If the chimney ia big enough he comes
right down it. If it isn't big enough
ha walka right through the doors, no
lock prevailing against him. If it
ia best he walk into the open door
of tha church house and picks the pre
off 'the tree. I you love a the
ChVJt would have you love, as yon
' must if you find any considerable part
of tha music in life, Santa Claua will
not mis you or your children, in the
good old-fashioned way.
"I know this is so. for it was told
to me by the fairest womnn who ejer
came to bless little children, and to
make this world sweeter and better.
Sha told ma all about how Santa Claua
put in tha rest of the year making
toys for good lad and lasaiea, anJ
how upon that evening when the
Christ Child cornea to tha home of
tha forester, ha goes Into every home
In the world whura lova dwells, leav
ing aomethlng that moans lova can
never die. 1 have aeen for myself
that he cornea to nearly 11 the lands
of the Western hemiafynerei and the
tale of the aea and the trackjesa path
thereof. Othera 'whose wandoring
foet have led them far have told me,
and I know that it la so, that 8anta
Claua aweep the whole earth with
bis reindeer on Chrtstmaa eve, and
that aa the eulnt of the children he
will live forever.
"Long since I came to know that
Santa Claua ia a fact. In deed and In
truth, because f ha come to my
own home. A the little light) of
mortality were lit in my home, be
'took note of It, and each Chrlatmaa
tide hia jingling aloigh drew up at
n.y door, Just aa he drew up at my
father's door, and the doors of mil
lion of other. Sometlmea I can aoa
Mm, and that when he nntea tlmt
there i but one pair of little atoek
inga banging thero, tears dim the eye
I
la
hat twinkle. He doea not atop com
ng, because of that. II knowa that
:ountleaa other father and mothers
see through a mist dimly when he
come again, and their hearta melt
with the thought of little hand that
no longer reach upin open-eyed de
light for the dollies and the toya and
the sweets. To be sure they can see
through those mista to a land of beau
ty, where an everlasting arm Is
around the little chapa who no more
welcome our Santa Clan with glad
acclaim. If it were not for that.
Christmas would not he a aeasnn of
joy to many of us grown-up children.
A it is, something tell us that all ia
well, that while we have loved we
have not lost, and that the love that
rules the gray old world will bring
u together at last. To we older lads
and lassiea this is the most precious
thing about Christmas, and we feel
little Invisible hands patting our faces
in pure delight and lending up to the
( hristmas tree or tho stocking on
Christmas morning.
Christmas morning.
"Tell them again, beloved, that
there la a aSnta Claua, that he is
coming just as surely as tomorrow.
Wherever he can he will como in his
own dear rotund shape, where it
seema beat he will use other agents.
Tell that once a year millions and
millions of people aee him and feel
him, that they are made better men
and women for it, that just so long
aa the globe rolls around and human
ity loves, ha will keep on coming, for
Santa Claus never gets older than he
now is, his reindeer never die and
never grow slow.
"If any there be who approach your
little one with a hint at the unreality
of thla same dear Old Sunta Claus, ex
plain that the idol-breakers are mis
taken, that just so long as there is
love in the human heurt, which will
he forever and a day, there wül be
the annual coming of the good oM
saint. Teach them to riing to their
faith, and when their feet lead then
onward through the open door of I if'
they will bless you when you have
fallen asleep ami their children and
(.:r children's children hanir up their
stockings as did even you and I.
"Of truth, there is a Santa Claus!"
