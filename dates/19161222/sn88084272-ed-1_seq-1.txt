'BRITISH RESENT
WILSON'S ITE
Surprise and Irritation Are
Dominant Expressions
in Press Comment.
London, Eng., Dec. 22. The general
public had its first news of president
Wilson's note from the morning papers
and the matter was the one topic of
conversation. The people, like the
press, were rather taken aback, as
they had about arrived at the conclu
sion that premier Lloyd George's
speech had put an end to all peace
talk unless the central powers, in their
reply to the premier, were prepared to
define their terms.
"Xo, I the Reply."
The evening papers, which do not
print editorials, came out with big
headlines which expressed their views.
The Evening News, which Is the after
noon edition of the Daily Mail, heads
a reprint of the comment of the morn
ing papers, with the one word, "No,"
in large, black type, and under it.
"Our Answer to President Wilson," and
again "No. No, No, that is the -answer i
Great Britain gives today without a j
moment's hesitation to the surprising ;
note from president Wilson." ;
Search for Motive.
One section of the press, utterly re
jecting any idea of the possibility of
peace negotiations as the outcome of
the recent German note, attributes the
president's action to the success of
propaganda conducted by count von
Bernstorff in America and what they
describe as the masterly inactivity of
the late British government. The more
general impression is that the agita
tion in America for an embargo on
foodstuffs bad much to do with Mr
Wilson's action. It is also suggested'
that the president may have received
secret information from the Carman I siaiemeai at present In regard to pres
governmcnt and is aware of the ex- lcent V ilson's peace note, considering

go toward -reparation.-restitution ana

.,--
The Dallv Chronicle further
"We are bound to observe that with
only the recent exception in the mat-
ter of Belgian slave raids, president
Wilson never in the face of an un-
paralleled opening intervened on the
ground of humanity before."
"Had Better Learn to Talk."
The Graphic says: "President Wil-
son's note shows that there is a gulf
as deep as the ocean between the mind
of Europe and the mind of the ruling
party in the United States. Mr. Wilson
demonstrated that he htd never even
began to understand the causes of the
present war or the forces that prolong
it. He affirms that the United States
is Interested in the protection of tn?
smaller states, yet when Belgium sent
a deputation to Washington at the be
ginning of the war, he refused to lift
a finger in their behalf.
"We. who know what war means,
can only reply to the president by
telling him that e had better begin

The Daily News, which is the near

which it says president Wilson re
