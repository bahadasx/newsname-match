Interest in the coming session of
the state legislature centers on the
election of speaker for the House of
Representatives.
There are seven candidates for
speaker. Five of the seven have
agreed to submit their claims to a
"jury" of ten fellow members and
abide by their decision, four of them
withdrawing in favor of the man se
lected by the committee as vost avail
able.
The "jury" will probably meet in
St. Paul night. W. I. Nolan of Min
neapolis! is the chairman of the
"jury" which consists of one mem
ber from each of the ten congres
sional districts. The names of the
committee have not been made pub
lic.
Candidates agreeing to the elim
ination plan are Theodore Christian
son of Dawson, Claude E. Southwick
of Wells, John B. Hompe of Deer

fad Ralph J. Parker of Spring Valley

the ten committeemen must agree on
a speakership choice to make the ac
tion binding.
Warner of Aitkin and Oscar
Swenson, candidates for speaker, are

A larger tax on automobiles may
be the subject of a bill at the next
legislature. The proceeds would be
used to upkeep state roads. Senator
Fred Vibert of Cloquet believes the
small license fee of $1.50 for three
years! is a joke and thinks the fig
ures should be $10 a year, giving the
state a revenue of about $1,300,000

Senator P. H. McGarry of Walker
is preparing a bill to give the high
way commission control of all the
road building and repair work in
Minnesota. He contends and Sena
tor Baldwin of Frazee, who has also
investigated the subject, bears him
out, that more than $10,000,000 of
the money expended on Minnesota
roads in the last year was wasted and
that similar amounts have been
wasted for many years. It is stated
by those who favor the highway com
mission control, that village and
township authorities just spend the
money and that they don't build
roads!.'

(By United Press)
Washington, Dec. 22.Congress
quit work today and went home for
Christmas)
In anticipation of the adjourn
ment many solons departed several
clays ago. But the big crowd leaves
today.
The president was not much in fa
vor of the idea, nor was Speaker
Clark, because there is so much leg
islation for the thoroughly Democrat
ic present congress to finish before it
dies March 4 and is replaced by one
not quite so Democratic.
However, President Wilson did not
"disapprove" of this adjournment,
according to Democratic Leader
Kitchin. To make up the time thus
lost both houses will convenene be
tween 10 and 11 o'clock for the re
mainder of the session. Kitchin said
all appropriation bills would be pass

diate it as such.

BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA. FRIDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 22.1916.
CHRISTMA S
WEDDINGS Judge Crowell presented William
Hogland and Miss Mayme McKay,
botn giving their place of residence
as Bemidji, with a Christmas present
late yesterday afternoon in the shape
of a marriage certificate, the cere
mony being performed at the judge's
office in the Bacon block. The newly
weds are recent comers to Bemidji.
The magistrate was at the court
house at the time the prospective
bride and groom presented them
selves at the judicial office and the
groom-to-be sent a jitney after the
judge, John Ward being the pilot of
the conveyance.
Misls Mary Bell, attendant in Dr.
Gilmore's office, across the hall, was
enlisted as a witness and Mr. Ward
performed a similar service. Judge
Crowell gave his hair an extra touch
and proceeded to tie the knot in such
a satisfactory manner that the happy
groom peeled off a five spot from a
comfortable roll and handed it over
to the judge. The latter in turn
handed back the change, $2, but the
groom was so pleased with the man
ner in which the judge officiated that
he refueled the change.
"No, I didnt' kiss the bride," quoth
the judge in response to a query by
a Pioneer representative. "Getting
a little too gray,"' he added in a sort
of an abstract manner, as a smile
o'erspread,, his countenance.

INSURANCE ADJUSTERS
HERE AFTER XMAS
In all probability the insurance ad
justers for the fire which destroyed
the Dalton building will not arrive
in'Bemidji until after Christmas day.
Such is the belief of E. B. Berman,
of the Berman Insurance agency,
which carried the insurance on the
building.
Although Mr. Dalton has not any
immediate plans for the future as re
gards the now vacant corner, in all
probability there will riste a modern
building upon the site.
MANY LAND SALES
INDICATE PROSPERITY
Beltrami county is surely coming
into its own and indications of near
future prosperity are seen in the
sales of farm lands despite the fact
that this time of year is usually re
garded as not the best for showing
lands*.
The firm of Reynolds & Winter re
port activity in land deals and one
of their most recent was the sale of
a 40-acre tract south of Bemidji to
Miss N. G. Ober, a school teacher who
resides in North Dakota. Her pur
chase was as an investment. She
paid $3 an acre down, her first total
payment being $140, and the bal
ance will be paid at the rate of $96
per year with six per cent interest
for a period of five years. It is
argued that by that time the land
will have doubled or more in value
and the purchase will also be a sav
ings account as well as an invest
ment.
Other recent sales to show the ac
tivity of farm lands in Beltrami
county by this firm may be mentioned
the sale of 240 acres to C. R. Glick
of Columbus', Ind., the land lying six
miles south of Bemidji. It is the
intention of Mr. Glick to locate upon
his land nert spring and commence
its improvement.
B. H. Rouser of Rhielander, Wis.,
is another who purchased a 140-acre
tract four miles south of Bemidji,
near the farm of August Jarchow.
Mr. Rouser will also become a resi
dent on his new property next storing.
S. E. Brower has bought an 80
south of Lake Plantaganet. He comes
from North Dakota and will move
in the spring.
Samuel Saathoff of Lamberton,
Minn., has purchased a 160-acre farm
12 miles south of Bemidji and will
move in the spring, also.
Abner Stone of Newville, N. D.,
has taken a 40-acre tract south of
Bemidji and will move and improve
his new holdings.
From the above indications of nu
merous land sales are not hard to dis
cern and Mr. Reynolds-says the out
look is very flattering.
