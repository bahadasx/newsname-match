TO OUTLINE PEACE TEK3C
President Thinks Possibly Nation;

Even of Military Conquest.
Washington. Di>c. 20.?Presider
Vilson lias appealed to all the belli?
:rents to discuss terms of peace.
Without actually proposing peac
>r offering mediation, the presides
^as sent formal notes to the goverc
nents of all the warring nations sug
jesting that "an early occasion b
;ought to call out from the nation
iow at war such an avowal of the!
espective views as to the terms upo
'-hich the war might be conclude
tnd the arrangements which would b
lepmed satisfactory as a guarant
tgainst its renewal or the kindling c
my Minnar utiiijiiit in ujc iuiuic, c?
vould make it possible frankly t
:ompare them."
Wholly without notice and entirel
'ontrarv to what administration ol
icials have described as his cours<
he president last night dispatche
lotes to all the belligerents, and to a
he neutrals for their informatioi
?>mnmanVd in the president's ow
aords as contained in the note? hi
ittitude i6 as follows:
*>"ot Kven Mediation.*'
"Thp nrp^irlpnf is nor nronosm
>eace: he is not even offering med'.f
ion. He is merely proposing tba
soundings be taken in order that w
nay learn, the neutral nations wit
he belligerents, how near the have
)f peace may be for which all mai
dnd longs with an intense and ir
Teasing longing. He believes thf
lie spirit in which he speaks and th
>bject which he seeks will bo undei
stood by all concerned, am. he cor
idently hopes for a response whic
trill bring q new light into the attan
)f the world."
This latest development in the raj
dly moving world events toward
Jiscussion of peace was not permitte
:o become known until tonight whe
;he notes were well on thoir way t
he American ambassadors in the be
ligerent capitals and probably alread
n the hands of some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to a
official Washington which had bee
led to believe that with the form:
transmittal of the proposals of tt
:entral powers, the offices of the Un
ted States would "await further move
between the belligerents themselv*
md that certainly, in view of tt"
speech of Premi r Lloyd-George an
the announements in Russia, Franc
and Italy, additional action by nei
trals would depend upon the ne:
careim delicate moves or tne dp
ligerents. ^
Step Toward Peace.
The whole tenor of official opinio
throughout Washington when tl
president's action became known wj
that it immeasurably improved tl
prospects for some sort, of exchang*
looking toward an approach to peac
ci'ssions between the belligerent
witnout impairing tne position 01 ti
I"nited States should they finally t
unable to find a ground on which 1
approach one another.
At the White House no statemei
whatever could be obtained as 1
whether any of the powers even ha
intimated how they would receive tt
note and there was every indipatic
that the same careful secrecy whic
prevent'd anything whafever becon
mg known about the presidents a
tion until it had been taken woui
surround any of the succeedir
moves.
Nowhere on the surface appeal
any indication of the history "makir
events which diplomats general
are convinced must have happen*
since the German allies brought fori
their proposals to dispel the gene
ally prevalent belief that such an a
tion oi' the part of President Wi
son would be unacceptable to the ei
ten to powers.
British embassy officials declare
they were utterly taken by surpris
vpr*. wholly unable to explain it, ar
were emphatic in their declaratioi
no evHianges whatever had pas
<vi through the embassy here as

tt Robert Elliott Gonzales, 28 years of
age, who in half a decade naa oy lii*
I work on The State made secure his

t titioners of that fine journalistic art,
- died of pneumonia late Tuesday night
- j at El Paso, Texas. He enlisted as a
e private in the Second South Carolina
s, infantry on the mobilizing of the
r militia last June and before his com
mand left Camp Moore for the fron
tier in August he had won on merit
e promotion to a sergeantcy in tne ma
v chine gun company. Last Saturday
?f he was relieved of an arduous tour
s of patrol duty and almost immediate

short days cut short his life of rare
r achievement and brilliant promise
The end came in the base hospital
at Fort Bliss.

s in Columbia, probably Monday, with
military honors.
So abrupt and extreme a termina
g tion of his illness ^vas not expected.
- but the first intimation, received Sun
t day evening, was disquieting and
9 members of his family made prepara
h tions to join him. He had obtained ,
n a furlough and expected to partlci

Iv Sergt. Gonzales' death were delayed'
in transit and also by the difference
11 in time, so that although the end
!/i came at 11:30 o'clock Tuesday night, i.
Jl the news did not reach Columbia until
le early yesterday, after The State had,
i- gone to press. Th<* tidings spread!
?? quickly and'all yesterday and last1

early in the afternoon telegrams be
>n gaii arriving from fellow craftsmen,
ie many of whom knew the man but
is through his work yet though it hati

is loved. The dominant note in all these
:e messages is that of proud sorrow.
s,i Robert'Gonzales was born in Co

)e William E. and Sarah Cecil Shiver
"n uio paternal srandf.ither.
! the Cuban patriot, Gen. Ambrosio -Joso

One of the most pleasing is the old s
French carol, the first stanza of which
is as follows:
r
The first Xoel the angels did say, ; ?
Was to certain poor shepherds in ^
the field as they lay;
In the field as they lay, lay keeping ~
their sheep, ' v
On a cold winter's night that wa

Another is the well known song be- '
ginning: i 1
Oh, little town of Bethlehem,
How still we ste thee lie;
Above the deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark strei-t sbmeh
The everlasting light,

It is hoped that all the people will
come out and join the children in
:h >ir effort to bring to the city a
k^oImio- r>f cprminp ('hristmahoer. A
special invitation is extended to the
old people of the city. The exercises
will be short, and to come will mean
little more than a pleasant walk to!
the square. The celebration will not
conflict with the exercises in the va
rious churches.
