PEACE EfTOBT
UP Tf ALLIES
Critical Barrier to the Result:
Sought by President Lies
in London, Paris and
Petrograd.
APPEAL IS TO PEOPLES
OF COUNTRIES AT WAR!
Feared That Governments Will
Refuse to Budge From First
Stand U. S. Has
Other Plans.
Ji.teniatiun.il News Servier
WASHINGTON. Pec. 22. Prest
Wilson today is anxiously awaiting
tbe action of the entente govern
ments on his note urpinjr peace.
Administration leaders declared that
the critical barrier to the result
soticht hy tlie president lay in Ixm
ildii, Paris and Petroirrad.
News from findoii that the
American communication was re
ceived with surprise" did not tend
to discourage officials; here. They
point out that the only effect of the
note thus far has been on Great
Pritain's administrative officers.
The main reliance of the American
government, it was said, is in pain
ing the support of the peoples of
both warring leagues of nations and
forcing through public sentiment.
Administration ofticials are pln-
ninj? their faith in the success of the
Wilson note on the fact that neither
vrroup of nations call reject it on the
roimds that the entente Kovern
ments rejected the Teutonic peace
overtures. It was said then that no
move would ho possible towards
reaching a basis for peace discus
sions so loner as Germany and her
allies made their sucreestion of peace
negotiations in the role of a victor
ious alliance.
i;HH-t Favorable Action.
Naturally this attitude cannot bo
taken toward the American note.
Tbe present expectation of the
president's adisers is that Germany
will treat the suestinn with the
utmost consideration and possibly
may indicate willingness to po fur
ther toward hrinin about the end
of the war than it has yet Rone.
This would be in line with the evi
dent (Jerman policy, and would help
the central powers by enlisting to a
greater extent the sympathy of the
neutral world.
It is feared. however. that the
governments of the entente may re
fuse to budee from the position
taken months aso when the Ameri
can governmental auent "felt out"
the sentiment toward peace. It was
indicated plainly then that a pca
move by any neutral nation would
be not only unwelcome, but an act
ual embarrassment because of the
i eoessity of rejecting.
Path-mi Near Fiul.
Ofüeials here hint broadly today
that a rejection of the American
note would not be the last step by
the Cniled States. The patience of
the administration is near an end,
they pointed out. and the president
is not expec ted to accept meekly an
answer of that sort. They declined
to indicate what action the Fnited
States could take short of actually
participating in ti e war on one side
or the other, maintaining that no
one has been taken into the presi
dent's confidence to that extent.

LONDON. Dec. 22. Mtheugh
ho.stile criticism is bein directed
against Prcst Wilson's note to tlie
belligerent powers, suggesting that
they state their pe:io terms it is
generally conceded that the Ameri
can executive was prompted in his
action by a spirit of humanitarlan
ism. The official text of the not
v as not may public through the
press bureau until 7 o'clock last
night, although summaries of the
note had been earned by several
news agencies. The contents of the
note were known to members of th
cabinet, to a majority of the mem
bers of parliament, and in the news
paper offices many hours before the
official text was release, by the
press Hnau censor.
The astonishment j.tealent on
Thursday had not abated today. The
comment on the American note was
nearly as keen, if not fully so, as
that which greeted the proposal of
Dr. von Bethrnann-Hollweg. the
German chancellor, that the bellig
erent powers "enter into peace ne
gotiations forthwith."

Noel K. Buxton, a liberal member
of commons, in speaking rn the
Wilson note in parliament on Thurs
day said:
"The government w ill w eb-om--

The Daily Chronicle says that
Pres't Wilson's statement th it th"
objects of both belligerents are ;r
tually the same i.s mo.-t painful f r
liberals." It adds:
"The president did not mean hi--words
