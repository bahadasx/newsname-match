Scott 'rH.(-ain-ii-l.
General Scott was ful'ieotod to
sharp cross-examination today on his
reiterated expression in favor of uni
versal servile based in part on the
volunteer system as shown in tne mo- ,
ni ' "zation of the national guard fori
border service. Five of the twenty1 two
members of the committee took oe
r o ion to state their belief In tho the
ory of universal service, while two
emphatically declared against Mich
a system. Those favoring were Rep
resentatives Katin, Gro'-ne of Ver
mont and Tilson of Connecticut, re
publicans", and Olney of Massachu
setts and Farley of New York, denio--irats;
while those opposed wor- Rep
rose, native Mclvellar of Tennessee and
ltepiesentative Quinn of Mississippi,
democrats.
The statement of Representative
Tilson, who went id the border as n
colonel in the national guard, followed
General Scott's repeated
assertion I
that the fedofaliaition of the national
guard aeeomp'ishcd as far lis possiVe
iy the jiatlonaMlefonsejiet would not
meet the country's military needs.
Tilson States Views.
"Mai.y members, n majority of the
national guardsmen who come back
from the border, are in favor of uni
versal service," declared the chief of
slaff.
' "I agree with you," snid Uopresont
ativo Tilson, "that voluntary military
service is not an adequate system ant?
probably would break down in lime
of war, as it husi done j before. The
national guard system in particular
is economically unwise heoauso of the
dual control over tho forces by the
federal government and the state."
Taking' up the report on the mobil
ization of the guard which Genera)
Scott presented to support Ills af
r.'iignment of any volunteer system,
Representative Tilson continued:
"Hut do you think it
to the nut ional guard
is quite fair !
!
"III what respect?" asked General
Seott.
"Don't you think. General, that in
view of the enormously greater task
of the regular service as the agent
which conducted the mobilization, the
regular army fell down harder in
proportion than the national guard?"
Admits t'l-iticisin Is Due.
"We make many criticisms of our
selves," I ieneral Scott said, adding
that a report on tho army's shaie in
the mobilization already had been
asked for and would be presented.
"That is what 1 want to appear in
this retord." said Mr. Tilson, "because
1 want to show that no set of officers,
ii" matter how well trained, could
make this national guard system
work."

wish to follow the example of Ger

bjiiinn put a iiuestiim to the witness
on the assumption that congress
might pass such a Mil, Representative
McKellar interjected; "You need not
fear, it will not."
"It won't except over my vote," ad
ded Representative tjuinn.
Tiie probable nature, of the bill
now being drafted by a committee of
the general staff was not disclosed by
General Scott, who also refused to
estimate the cost of such a system,
except to say that proportionately it
would be much less than the expense
of volunteer method of training
troops. It is known, however, that
the possibility of welding into the
new projects the various sections of
the defense act dealing with industrial
organization for war purposes, tho
right to take over and operate manu
facturing plants, railways, and other
peace time agencies, is under consid
eration. Secretary linker told tho
committee recently ho was undecided

mil a system of selective conscription,
'Il0 hi'ter plan being
understood to
as well as ttie
include the industrial
military services.
When Cencral Scott said that
many members of the national guard
believed in universal service, Repre
sentative McKellar interrupted:
' "That may be because you ara
keeping them on the border as police.
I get letters every day indicating that
many of them believe they arc- not
fairly treated. The. great body of! the
guard want to do their duty."
"I think it is s

"Then, whv not Kive this new syp-
tern a fair trial before you condemn :
it?"
"We are Riving it a fair trial, atidithere u great naval base and coaling;
working in good faith to get the best ; station for the I'nited States fleet,
results from it.
Do you think wo will ever, get tho
(kind of an army we should have as
jlong as high officers of the regular
army refuse to bow to the manuaies
of congress'.'" insisted Representative
McKellar. "You are condemning the
system before it gets started. Do you
think it is a good thing for generals
of the army to ' coming out with re-i
ports and magazine articles knocking ;
the system?"
"I was sent here by the president ,
and tilt M.-eretsry of war, to present '
my views," replied (ieneral Scott. i
"How close will this system you
have proposed bring us to militar
ism?" said Represonlative Litt lepago. j
"A long way from it," answered tho
officer. "I do not see that there is
anything like militarism in it. It's a
democratic system." 1
Representative Shaiienborger asked

in history to s"tid largo invading j
