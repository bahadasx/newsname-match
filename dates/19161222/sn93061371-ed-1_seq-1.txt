"Peace l& Imposaiba
Without Reparation"
(Pays Doyd-Geoifielin the Ilousd
of Commons)
, London, Dec. 19 The first
appearance of David LU.yd
Ct'i gt i rfi s e the house of com
' iiions ar; premier Was made to
day in circuruBtanees seldom,
if ev-ft- faced liy a hew holder ot
the oiilce. Even If (lie peace
" Ji reposals of the central powers
had not intervened, his state-,
ie nt of the policy of his govern
ment, which was chosen in re
ply to a public demand for more
vigorous prosecution of the war,
would have marked an import-:
JjMatcfiih thfe wb'rld feonflict.
The peace note, however, shift
ed the interest, and every corner
of the world awaited the an
nouncement as to the British at-1
titude toward the move of the
central powers.
frerhler liloyd f jeorge said
that it was felt that they should
know before entering on nego
tiations that Germany was pre
pired to accede to the only
terms whereon it was possible
r peacb to be obtained and
'"Whifainfetl fn WUrope. t Thb
premier said that with rut lepar
a'ion peace would be impossible.
Mr. Lloyd-George said there
were no proposals for peace. To
enter into proposals of which
they had no knowledge w-is o
I t their hadn into a i.oose wi h
ihM"l-ep9'eilditt the' hrtnds of
Germany.
"The allies will insist that the
only end of f he war must be a
guarantee against Prussian
militarism disturbing the peace
of Europe. -
' We will V,iit, until we heai
ttliat teliiis End guarantees
there are surer t ban those which
Germany broke. Meanwhile,
we put oui trust in our unbrok
u army.
"The speech of Chancellor
von Bethmanmllollweg before
the German Telehstag constitut
ed Tii substance a denial of the
only terms upon which peace
was post ible.
"Peace without reparation is
impossible, and it is not true
that all the outrages on land
and sea have been liquidated by
a few pious ph razes about
humanity."
'Without reparation, peace
is impossible. Moreover, what
guarantee is thero thct subter
fuges will not be qsed in future
to overthrow any treaties of
peace whereinto we might now
nter':"
"We must keep a steadfast
eye on the purpose for which we
entered the war. We entered
it to defend Europe fiom ag
gressions ef the Prussian mili
tary caste. We must insist
that there be the most complete
guarantees against this cast
ever disturbing against the
peace of Europe.
"We will wait until we hear
what terms and guarantees
there are other than those,
gurer than those which Ger
many so lightly broko. Mean
while wo shall put trust in our
unbroken army rather than in
broken faith."
We Give Two Cent
For The Armenians
The total amount contributed
for the Armenian andSeiian re
lief Trom the beginning of the
campaign on October 1 to Nov
ember 3 is $2 018,902.1S. The
sum seems large, but is pitifully
small compt Tvjd with the need
of the recipient?, It is less than
two cents apiece for each of us.
Here we afe confronted with
the spefctdtle ot the most terri
ble religious persecution of all
history, far surpassing in ex
tent and brutality the Ipersecu
tion by Nero and the harrying
of the Jlaguenots. As nearly
as can be ascertained a million
Christians havo been murdered
or . starved to de.ith. There ic
nothing tqiis done about -thai
now. Killing a million
Turks, most of them innocent
of the crime, would not bring
back to life the littlest of the
slaughtered babies. What does
concern Us or should is that
there are two million more
Uhristiar-s in Armenia and $yria
who are still alive, but not likely
to live long unless we get help
to them soon. Some of them
have uen transported hundreds
of miles dway and left to starve
in the desert: Men have been
conscripted for the army; wom
ed taken to the harem; children
ki 'naped into "slavery. Thous
ands have been slain because
ihey refused to deny Chiist and
ttiose who survive are threaten
ed with the same fate In, for;
mer time's it tfas jtjpsibb for
some to escape massacre by
flight into the United States,
but this city of refuge is novv
closed to them by the war. This
is a field in which Americans
have always taken a Special in
teitfst because of those Who
have come to us and IjecaUse of
the schools and missions we
have supported there. But
what avail is all our missionary
work if the people themselves
are destroyed?
Q Vet when told of this dire dis
tress the American people have
on the average not been willing
to sacrifice twocigaretsor sticks
of chevvinggum. We ought to
do more than the beligerants
for the releaf of the suffering in
Europe, but we are doing less
The profit We have made on the
food sold to the British and
Fn rich for the relief of the
Belgians is greater than the
amount we have given to that
fund. The American Commit
tee for Armenian and Syrian
Relief, whose headquarters is at
70 Fifth Avenue, New York, is
preparing to send a Christmas
ship filled with food and c'olh
mg for the destitute near the
Mtditeranean coast. For these
in the interior money h sent to
bo spent locally by American
consuls and missionaries, aided
in some places by German of
ficials and teachers. The two
million dollars so far eenr. is
mostly spent already, leaving
t he long winter still to provide
tor. kx.

hind, .litti I'llWau, with ImriicleriK
lie Klubliomness, rrtused to part Willi
his treasure. It was fl fo chair of
solid mahogany.
On the very next night, Jim met El
sie Thurston. It was at a Country
club dance, nnd after the third for
trot, Jim decided that Klsle was alto
gether the finest girl he hntl ever met.
lOlsle, on lift part, evidently evusitt
ered Jim with favorable light, for she
gave him three other (lomen before"
to pvenlng was over, and jtl.ft bffor
they p'firti'd he acquiesced In h(i us--gestlon
that lie 8" to see her on the
next evening.
Jim appeared at the Thurston resi
dence shortly after eight o'clock, Kl
sie, having decided to look her cry
best, was not ready when th rlsitof
urrived, eo Mr. Thurston Introducing
blniaclf, ftccepted the role of enter
tainer. Thi4 conversation drifted to
college nnd the pruuks of various) stu
dnt!?. "'erf, we do have lots of fun," Jim
said In cnstvrr to a question of the
older man. "But, then, we study m.
bit, too."
"Well," Mr. Thurston answered
grlnll.f, "I know one time when dome
of you didn't tudy any. That wa
two nights ago."
Jim's heart missed tt beat.
"What happened !" he fltfcert Inno
cently, "A' bufch f students came eer'
here after midnight and stole one of
my best chairs." Jtm'a fare took on
a slight tinge, but it was darfc and Mr.
Thurston did not notice. "It was f.
chair I value highly," he continued,
"imd If I could fitwl out vho took It I
would prosecute hint to vhe full ex
tent of the law."
."Stnybe I could scout nrotinil antl
find it for you," Jim suggested.
"If you do I chall be eternally?
obliged to you," the other unwered. I
Klsie appeared, rndiunt in crea
tion of shimmering blue. ji
"V?(TM you like to go in nnl lookj

t(on Wns it chair Identical in appear
ance With tlie one which reposed In
the corner, his own room, , Elsie fol-
lowcd.his glance.
"What's the matter?" nhe asked,
noting his startled expression.
"Why I er was looking at that
chair," he managed to answer. "It'si
rather odd. Isn't It?"
"Yes, it Is one of a pair we used to
tt.'tre that has been in the family for ,
years." t
Jimexaniliicd the chair w ith inter-
est. '
"Voti say that there was another
one?" he asked. "Where Is it?" 1
"A group of college boys stole It th '
night before last," she nnswered. ,i
"Oil, that's a fclmiue!" lie spoke in-"
iligliiintly. "Do they fit together?" (
"'es, they were so made that they
could be Joined to form a tete-a-tete.'
Do you see where the Joints are?" (
"Maybe," he suggested, "I can look
around the dormitory und liml the
other one. And if I do, I'll bring It
back to you."
o bright and early the next morn
ing, he seated himself at hU desk and
wrote a letter:
"Dear Elsie:
"I scouted around last night and
found your chair in one of the stu
dent's rooms. Unless I hear from you
by phone, I shall bring it over to
night." No phone message was forthcoming,
so nt eight o'clock Jim pucked the
chair In his runabout and departed
for Olenwood. Mr. Thurston was seat
ed on ills veranila when he urrived.
"I am very much obliged and In
debted to ;-ou," be announced, when
Jim showed him his precious cargo.
"Elsie is in the library."
Taking the chair with him Jim en
tered the house. When Elsie saw him,
she gave a cry of delight.
"Ob. it Is Just line of you!" she ex
claimed. Alter that, the evening flew by on
glided wings. I!ut just before It was
time to 0, Jim ventured a sugges
tion. '.'You haven't shown me how those
chairs are Joined together to make a
tete-a-tete," he said.
"No," she answered, "I haven't, but
I will."
She Joined them deftly, and a few
minutes Inter Jim was sitting In one,
with Elsie beside him In the other.
