COL ROOSEVELT
Former President Writes That
He Hopes to Visit Hawaii
One Year Hence
Former President Theodore Roose
velt will not be in' Hawaii this winter
as has been expected. Alexander
Hume Fcrd received a letter from
him this morning in which Col. Roose
velt said that he would not visit Ho
nolulu until a year hence, when he
would be pleased to accept the invita
tion of the Pan-Pacific Club and be
its guest and that he looked forward
with pleasure to meeting the people
cf the Pacific countries here, it Is
likely that a similar letter has been
sent to the Chamber of Commerce,
but up to noon it had not been re
ceived. " ' - " : -
The first intimation that Col. Roose-
velt mieht have Dostnoned or fore
gone his proposed trip to Hawaii, Sa
moa, the Fiji Islands and other Pa
cific countries came in a despatch
published in a mainland paper, which
sr. id that Roosevelt 'had deserted the
Fijis for a devil fishing tHp. This
despatch was as follows: "
DAXVILE.-ya, Dec, Col. Theo-
dore Roosevelt plans to ship before
the mast, be an ordinarj' seaman and
fisherman and abandon his projected
"Fiji Island trip for the lure of devil j
fishing.
"Russell J. Coles, wealthy tobacco
leaf dealer, is authority for the story
and he says he's just back from Oys
ter' Bay.
"The colonel. Coles said, will ship as :
a member of the. crew at Punta Gordn j

AND PAROLING
Judge Says Legislature Should
Amend Law to Give Some
Discretion
That he has considered the indeter
minate sentence law unconstitutional,
but has bowed to the decision of high
er tribunals; that paroles cannot be
granted until the minimum sentence
has been worked out, and that the gov
ernor has no authority to commute
sentences, is the opinion of Circuit
Judge C. W. Ashford as pointed out
in a statement given the Star-Bulletin.
Judge Ashford says he feels that
the legislature, if wedded to the idea
of a parole system, should so amend
the law as to vest the discretion in
the executive officers to grant the
parole at any time after conviction, ir
rpsnprtivp of thfi leneth of the seri-
(ence ; ..
He calls attention to the Filipino
murderer on Hawaii whose sentence
recently was "commuted" from deatn.
to life imprisonment by the governor.
"In my opinion," says Judge Ashford,
"the governor has and had no au
thority to commute that sentence, and
it follows that the prisoner should
either be hanged or pardoned. I sin-
cerely hope that the legislature will
! look into tuis case and into the gen-
j eral subject of commutations."

Head Will Probably Leave
Utilities Board Soon;
Charles R. Forbes, chairman of the

ably resign that office early In the

resigning from this office," said the
chairman, "and I have practically
made up my mind to do it My health
has been such of late that I have de
cided it is-wise to take such action."
Forbes has also practically decided
to leave for a trip to the mainland
within a few days, provided he can
get his work, In shape to get away.
Ill health is also the cause for this de
cision. It is understood that he will

sible." I'.' ::'-
"There are some matters to . pre
sent to the legislature in connection
with the public utilities commission
the chairman said, "and these Lwish
to take up before tendering my resig
nation." '
A. .1. Gignoux, commissioner,- ex
pressed surprise at Forbes annonnce
ment today, stating that he regrets ex
ceedingly to hear of the chairman's
intended action. During Forbes term
in office the commission has handled
several cases of more than ordinary
import, the last and largest being the
present hearing of Inter-Island rates.

commission have been investigation of
all the telephone, companies of the
