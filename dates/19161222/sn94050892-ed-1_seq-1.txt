RANGER WIRELESS
GETS MESSAGES
FROM AFAR
1 iiuiii 111 1111
Antennae of Arizona Ranger's Outfit
Catch Messages from Warships at
Sea. .
Albuquerque, N. M., Deo. 19.
"Wireless communication for trans
action of Forest business looks more
promising every day," is the statement
of li. V. Slonaker, telephone engineer
in the Forest Service, after his return
from Arizona to make a detailed in
spection of the wireless apparatus re
cently installed-by Kanger warner on
the Apache Forest.
Ranger Warner's wireless outfit was
erected under difficulties because of
Blender funds, according to Mr.' Slo
naker. The antennae, instead of be
ing mounted on the usual steel tower,
are hung from a pleee of barbed wire
fence strung between two high cliffs.
The antennae themselves are suppos
ed to be of brass, but when the brass
wire gave out ordinary baling wire
was used to complete them. Never
theless . they work. Mesages have
been picked up from Sayvllle, New
York; Key West, Florida; Point Lo
ma, California; Vancouver, B. C. ;
and even from warships at sea. The
aDDaratus and its' installation cost
$125.00. A wire telephone line to con
nect with Clifton, the nearest town,
would liave cost $5000.00.
The outfit is already being used for
Forest business. - A message was re
cently sent to Silver City, via regular
telegraph from Clifton, making an ap
Tointment with a ranger on the Gila
ForeBt to meet at Alma, N, M., for
the purpose of receiving grazing ap
plications. .
By supplementing the wireless tele
graph installation with a few inexpen
sive appliances it is now proposed to
.change It into a wirless telephony
outfit. The advantages of wireless
telephony, according to Mr. Slonaker,
are very great. It obviates the neces
sity of either sender or receiver being
familiar with telegraphic codes .
It is said that the Forest Service is
considering trying out a modern wire
less telephone at the Grand Canyon.
It is .proposed to connect the ranger
station near Ei Yovar with the ranger
station on the Kanab Plateau on the
-north side. The -cost of stringing a
regular wire line across the Canyon
would be about ten times the cost of
a wireless installation. The atmos
pheric conditdions in rough country
are supposed to be particularly unfav
orable to wireless, and should its use
prove practicable at the Canyon, its
.adaptibility for bridging the present
gaps in the forest service telephone
system would be considered by Forest
officers as practically assureq.

version dam above Florence and also
obtained $75,000 to commence the con
struction of the main canal which will
carry the water from this dam to the
lands belonging to Indians, and white
men in Pinal county. His request for
$125,000 to complete another diversion

PLANS TO ENLARGE
BISBEEAGREAGE
BISBEE, Ariz., Dec. 18. What is
expected to greatly, enlarge the south
western part, of the famous Bisbee
quadrangle in the 'matter of mine
development, has now been planned
by the ... Arizona-Bisbee Copper com
pany, which owns 1,200 acres situated
southwest of the Copper Queen Com
pany's immense acreage in that di
rection. The Arizona-Bisbee Copper Com
pany is directing its efforts in a busi
ness like manner to the point where
it can start the sinking of a deep
shaft to explore the lower limestones,
known to be in that region.
Arizona-Bisbee copper ground is
some of the best located in the Bis
bee district, and in the opinion of
many local geologists, needs only deep
naming to prove its ore values .
To the north of the property, the
Bisbee-West Company, many years
ago, sank a shaft a matter of 700
;et.- It is called the "Bisbee-West"
shaft and waa driven to barren schist.
When depth was reached, the com
pany drifted north in the same forma
tion, and not south across the "Bisbee-West"
fault. Geologists maintain
that the ore lies adiacent and south of
this prominent fault.
Should the many signs of habitation
be taken from. Sacramento hill.a huge
mass of porphyry, which sticks its
nose out of the - Bisbee district and

other hill of porphyry, situated about I

The number of Slaughter votes laid

ASHURST TAKES
BILL BY FORCE
Washington, D. C, Dec. 20. A parli
amentary mis play by one " of his
friends today upset plans for an im
mediate vote on Senator Sheppard's
District of Columbia prohibition bill
and advocates of the measure were
obliged to agree tnat it go over, until
j buster late, today when Senator Ash-
urst who favors it, without intention
of imperiling a vote; got unanimous
consent for consideration of a miscel-
bills out of the possession of the sen-
ate, said Senator Reed, "legislation
business then will resolve itself to
grabbing and running. Under these
circumstances the man who can grab
the most and run the fastest would
be the greatest statesman.

of Queensbury rules, it is time- ve
knew it. We may even descend to
packing house rules, which I Under
stand permit usinc: the thumbs and
even the feline method of scratching

Senator Ashurst declared he was
not disturbed by Mr. Reed's attack.

CAMPBELL-HUNT CONTEST GOES
TO ARIZONA SUPREME COURT
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 18. Superior.
Judge R. C. Stanford this ' morning
sustained governor-elect Thos. Camp
bell's motion to quash the contest pro
ceedings inaugurated by Governor
Hunt. .
The court held that because the sec
retary of state has never issued a cer
tificate of election to Campbell the
court has no official knowledge of the
result of the election, and is therefore
without jurisdiction. -
Governor Hunt immediately took an
appeal to the supreme court and it is
expected that the matter will be taken
up there tomorrow by stipulation. In
the meantime the ballot inspection is
suspended.
Unless a decision Is reached before
January first or a court, order is se
cured it is probable that both Govern
or-Elect Campbell and Governor Hunt
will claim possession of the office.
On the face of the certified returns
Campbell is elected by a plurality of
thirty votes. The governor alleges
that enough Improper ballots were
counted for Campbell to insure Hunt's
reelection if they were thrown out.
After the decision went against him
at the morning session. Senator Ives
tried to file a supers eadeas bond on
appeal to the Supreme Court.
The attorney for Mr. Campbell said
that they would waive the filing of
such bond and at 1:30 Senator Ives
then came into court and argued that
his appeal had been perfected and that
the recount should proceed. Judge
Stanford held that as the court had
no jurisdiction, no' case had been
started, there was no contest and
could be no recount. He dismissed the
whole proceeding.
Senator Ives then asked until 11 a.
m. on Tuesday to apply to the Su
preme Court for a writ of prohibition
to stop the court from stopping fur
ther inspection of the ballot.
The Hunt forces are badly discour
aged, not so much by reason of the de
cision today as by the fact that the re
count in Maricopa county has not dis
closed the frauds and irregularities
which they expected and because a
number of ballots have been laid aside
which eventually may be counted for
Campbell and add to his plurality.
-- Nothing to Contest
The motion to quash , the Hunt con
test proceedings, . granted . byJudge
Stanford, was based on -the fact that
under the statnte there must be a de
claration of result before the contest
is brought, and there had been no de
claration of result because the secre
tary of state had issued no certificate
of election to Thomas E. Campbell,
against whom the contest was brought
The attorneys for Mr. Campbell pro
duced numerous authorities to prove
that the declaration' of result was
in fact the issuance of a certificate
of election.
No Provision In Law
There is no provision in the law for
a declaration of result. The statutes
relating to contest proceedings refer
to it, but there is no provision for it.
The constitution provides . that certi
ficates of Selection must be issued "by
the secretary- of. state in accordance
with the provisions of law.. As this Is
the only .act which can be: construed
as a declaration of result Judge Stan
ford held that this constitutes the .'de
claration of result, and there having
been no certificate of election, there
has been no declaration of result.
As the whole action Is based on a de
claration of result, it must therefor
fall. .The recount falls with it..
, Hunt's Only Course.
The only course, outside of an ap
peal, open 'to the Hunt forces was to
eet the secretary of state to issue the
certificate of election to, Mr. Camp
bell. He has been holding this up,
giving one excuse or another. With
a certificate of election, Mr. Campbell
will take the office of governor on the
first of the year, and Governor Hunt
will be down and out.-,
The maneuvers of Senator Ives and
Frank E. Curley, attorneys for Hunt,
were all directed toward preventing
the issuance of a certificate of elec
tion; which must now be issued before
they can bring a new case in court.
Mr. Campbell will have ten days in
which to answer the new proceedings;
If the supreme court reverses the
action of the lower court it must over
rule its own decision in the Osborn
case, which was the action in which
the right of officers chosen at the first
state election to hold over was decid
ed. PHOENTX, Dec. 19. Following the
denial by Judge Stanford in the Su
perior court this morning of an in
junction to restrain Secretary of
State Sidney P. Osborn from issuing
a certificate of election to Governor
elect Thomas E. Campbell, Senator
Ives, counsel for Governor Hunt was
given two more set backs in his ef
forts in behalf of the governor, these
by the Supreme Court.
Senator Ives went from the Su
perior Court room to the- Supreme
Court at the capitol, where he ar
plied for a writ prohibiting ' Judge
Stanford from issuing an order in the
matter of a supersedeas bond, in con
nection with the appeal of Governor
Hunt from the decision of Judge Stan
ford yesterday, which was that his
court has no jurisdiction in a contest
until the certificate of election is
given. The order, which he. announc
ed he would issue this afternoon, the
purpose of which would have been to
stop the inspection or .ballots. . was
the one which Senator Ives sought to
prevent being issued.
r
. Judge Sloan and Mr. Bullard, coun
sel for 'Mr. Campbell, appeared be
fore the court along with . Senator
Ives and opposed , his motion which
was subsequently dropped. , .
The court announced that in hear
ing the appeal from the Superior
Court In the matter of the injunction
to restrain Secretary- of State Osborn
from issuing a cerificate of election
to Governor-elect Campbell, counsel
for Mr. Campbell will be permitted to
file answers and all papers necessary
in the case and will be given a full
hearing by the highest court In the
matter in which his - Intnrmata dm
vitally effected.
In the court below, counsel for Mr.
Campbell had made an effectual effort-to
be allowed to Intervene in"
behalf of Governor-elect Campbell. Al
though Judge Sloan pointed out -' the
vital interests of his client and stat- .
ed that contrary to all nrecedent - the
contestee had not been invited to ar-
pear by the attorney general, Judga
Stanford had held that he had - no
authority, under the proceedings then,
mvoivea, to grant tne application and
give-counsel for the contestee a stand-,
ing in the court above. .
Attorneys for Mr. Campbell had '
stated that they would appear in the
court," which would have ' entitled
them, to be heard in argument, but
would .have given, them no' . other
rights. Action of the Supreme Court
this morning gives them the standing
they desired. .
The gubernatorial contest between
Governor G. W. P. Hunt and Governer
elect Thomas E. Campbell today took
a step upward and is now waiting a
hearing In the Supreme Court. In
taking this step, while the court action
was brief, it was none the less heat
ed and the situation developed at
times to the stage that might be call
ed tense.
The argument in court this morning
was over the application of ; Judge
Sloan to be allowed to intervene on
behalf of Mr Campbell in injunction
proceedings brought against Secre
tary of State Osborn by Gov. Hunt1.
Attorney General Wiley E. Jones ap
peared in his official capacity as repre
seniauv oi oecreiary oi ' scale US-"
born to. oppose the application of Sen
ator Ives, representing Gov. Hunt.' to
restrain the secretary of 'state from'
issuing a ceroncaie or election ot
uovernor-eiect campDell.
Govrnor-elect Campbell Is not oft
record a party to the injunction pro
ceedings, although, as pointed out by
are designed to vitally affect his in-i
terests. Judge Sloan asked to inter
vene in order thatMr. Campbell might '
be represented by counsel with full
standing in the proceedings before the
Supreme Court.
This was opposed by Senator Ives,
who iu:ii:itain 'I ihat the ainaranca
of counsel, In the Supreme Court for
Mr. Campbell could not be for the pur
pose of expediting the - proceedings,
but would result in retarding the pro
ceedings. -. .- :, , -
Judge Sloan was evidently earnest
in his argument.,- He declared that his '
client is uouory.-eueeiea -dy me pro-
lut&i ue uuu .iwver in History ot
the territory or "of the state heard of
ests were vitally affected and he was

In the course of - his argument.
Judge Sloan made the offer that if.
the counsel for Governor Hunt would
withdraw their opposition to the Is
suance of i an- election certificate to
Governor-elect Campbell, they would
in turn expedite proceedings in the
contest and recount as much as pos
sible. This offer was rejected by Ives
Judge Sloan asked that Judge Stan
ford postpone his ruling on the appll-
Mttnn t n infpnrpno until V. a
argue the question before him as the
matter is to be decided by the Su
preme Court. "That Is our court and
we accept its decision as the law,"
stated Judge Stanford. "I have no
doubt, he continued,- "but that the
Supreme Court will consent to hear
you in the matter."
Judge Sloan vigorously protested
against the action of the Attorney
General and counsel for the contestant
and asked that his protest be made a
part of the record of the court.
Judge Stanford then sustained ' the
demurrer that had been offered by At
torney General Jones to the applica
tion for an lmnnrtion rpetminiTi th'
secretary of state from issuing a'
certificate " of -election, denied the mo
tion to enjoin and denied' the' applica
tion of counsel for Governor Elect
Campbell to participate".
The attorney general and Assistant
Attorney General .George. .Harben are
today engaged in preparing- the pa
pers for meeting the case in the Su
preme Court. It is expected "that the
Supreme Court will expedite the case
as -much as possible and that it will
be heard within a few days.
