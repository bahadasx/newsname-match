AND YET SOME PEOPLE WONDER
WHY LABOR SHOULD BE DISCONTED
By HARRY CALL
During the past few weeks people
have been debating the status of the
I. W, W. pro and eon. Numerous nnd
diverse questions have been asked in
regard lo their inception, tactics, etc.
Some people express surprise when
hasty and violent action is sometimes
taken by the wage earners.
I say the reason for this activity
does not come from any violent im
pulse on the part of the wage earners,
but because of the encroachments
made on litem by capital. I herewith
produce a copy of n circular letter
sent out by the Clear Lake Lumber
Company to the several lumber manu
facturers in this state, which is self
explanatory:
"Clear Lake, Wash., Nov. 28, 1916.
"Gentlemen: Owing to the high cost
of provisions, we find it necessary to
raise our board. On and after Jan
uary 1, 1!I17, the board at our mill and
■ at our camps will be $7.00 a week, or
$1.00 a day. Forty cents per meal
will be charged for any time less than
one week. We are compelled to make
this change in our board in order to
keep from running at a loss in our
boarding houses.
"For the past several years we
have charged six dollars a week for
board, while some of our neighbors
have charged from $5.25 to $5.50. We
have experienced no disagreeable re
sults in asking a fair rate for our
board, and trust that you can see
your way clear to join us and estab
lish a uniform rate throughout the
country. If you don't, it is simply an
indirect way of boosting wages, and
we think till agree that the wages are
high enough at the present time, in
tad, higher than the lumber industry
can stand. We believe they are so
high that it is lowering the efficiency
of labor Instead of improving it.
"We take the above aclion on the
date mentioned, regardless of what
others do, as we find it absolutely
necessary.
"Yours truly,
"CLEAR LAKE LUMBER CO."
Isn't that a gem? It is only a fair
example of the bone-headed reasoning
power of the average lumber manu
facturer. Let us inquire into the
matter and see just how far the "high
wages" in the lumber industry are
likely to destroy the efficiency of
labor, in the saw mills of this state
common labor receives from $1.75 to
$2.00 per day. At $1.75 per day. $38.75
is the most that can be earned in one
month: at $2.00 per day, $52.00 is the
most that could be earned in one
month. For the man who receives
$1.75 lei us deduct $30 for his board,
$1.00 tor hospital treatment and we
f.nd that It leaves him the great sum
of $7.76 per month for the purchase of
clothing, laundry and the other ne-i
cessltles ot the average human being.
For the $8.00 man it leaves $21 per
month.
In the logging camps the average
„age is about $3.50 per day. During
the winter months 50 per cent of the
time Is lost, thereby reducing the
logger to the same standard as the
rl.Te per day man of the saw mill.
What a great incentive there is for
the lumber worker, this should create
a deep* feeling of loyalty on the part
Of Mr. Lewis' employes for the Clear
Lake Lumber Company.
Not satisfied with starvation condi
tions In his own slave pens he seeks
to enlist the support of other manu
facturers so that they may bear part;|
of th* odium of h's vicious, proposal.
Of course, tbey have experienced no
disagreeable results from asking a
[ a [ r (?) rate tor board. The saw mill
Bjt D and loggers are unorganized and
it they do nol like it they can quit and
|Oln 'I'" camps on the highways. As
high wanes, there is no such thing
as high W« ".. in Ihe saw mills and
jogging camps of Washington, nnd
W ere will nol be until the men see
where their material interest lies, in
,be power of organization.
Why have we strikes in the lumber
~„,l shingle mills? Why has the I. W.
V activity been so great? Has it
V<n caused by agitatorat sure;
„I!ui the agitation has been done by
Mm Hartleys, Nobles, Lewis's and a
r«w lesser satalUtea who are trying
to control the liffl of labor.
These stomach robbing parasites
sl „,, 1( l all of their working hours
scheming bow to satisfy their greed.
*-|be time has come when working
mB regard a Jali sentence as a badge
of honor "/ben they are arrested for
revolttal against inhuman conditions.
A wrong state of nffairs, indeed, but
these employers are drunk with
power, They are seemingly blind lo
the storm they tire raising. If they
were the only ones to suffer from the
Inevitable result it would not be so
bad,.but Hie public, people who are in
no way directly interested, are also
i caused to suffer. The most rabid I.!
W. W. is a good citizen in comparison
wiili some of the lumber lords of the
Slate of Washington, There should
Ibe a common ground on whlcb these
employers and employees could meet,
but there is not; the employers forbid
it. They have demanded the last |
ounce of blood in a working man's
body to satisfy their lust for profits.
All honor to the man or woman who
has the courage lo revolt, and damn
I this 80-catted polite society that
stands idly by or aligns itself with
the robbers of women and little chil
dren.
Entrenched behind the walls of city,
state and national government the
plunder continues under the name of
"business." How long, oh, how long
will the sleeping giant, Labor, let this'
continue?
EVEN MOVIES NOT FOR
POOR, SAY COAL BARONS
Princeton, Ind., Dec. 16.—It's all
wrong, Steve. The high cost, of living
isn't due to food barons who gouge
the public to the limit It is all the
result of the terrible extravagance of
the workers. They occasionally "spend
a nickel on the movies.
At least, that is what the coal
barons here say.
One of the local coal operators told
this to a committee of the Princeton
city council:
"If the people of Princeton spent
less money going to moving picture
: shows they would have more money
to buy coal."
He forgot to mention, apparently,
that once in a while a poor mother
has been known to spread butter on
| her children's bread.
MILWAUKEE EIGHT
HOUR LAW VALID
The supreme court of Wisconsin has
handed down a decision upholding (he
eight-hour ordinance passed in 1911
by the Milwaukee city council. In
doing so it laid down the rule that the
State has a right to delegate to the
city its sovereign power, through th; 1
medium of a charter, so that a munici
pality may be enabled to regulate
matters connected wltb public em
ployment, This upsets the theory
thtil, under (he constitution, ii city
could be invested wltb no such power,
a contention like that of questioning
(he ability of the people of a democ
racy to confer power upon themselves.
THE UNIVERSITY
TUITION FEES
"I do not believe in the tuition
fee," President Suzznllo said in his
speech to the College Club Tuesday,
"but it must continue as an emergency
measure."
What is the emergency?
.lust because a narrow-minded legis
lature -WbOSS shining lights were the
ward heeler types of Roland Hartley
and Guy Kelly and Jimmy Davis —
wanted to punish the university for
its liberal ideals, the students were
made the goats.

The Labor Journal
AS THEY VIEW IT IN
LITTLE OLD NEW YORK
The Committee on Industrial Rela
tions has taken cognizance of the bat
tle of November 5 in this city, and;
though (he committee had no repre
sentative here, it gathered from out
siders reports coming near the truth,
but. exaggerated somewhat as to the
number killed and wounded. The re
port says:
Austin Lewis, a lawyer and a pub
licist of San Francisco, who is a mem
ber of the National Labor Defense
Counsel, made this statement to the
Committee on Industrial Relations:
"The facts of the case are these in
;i nutshell. The shingle weavers'
strike implied picketing. The picket*
ing implied annoyance to local busi
ness men. The annoyance developed
Into anger. Picketers were jailed and
then beaten. Men came front the har
vest fit Ids with enough money lo hire
j boats. They decided to bold a public
meeting in Everett, and on their at
tempting to land in Everett, were fired
upon by the sheriff's posse. A large
number were killed; at least fourteen,'
probably more. A still greater num-|
ber were wounded, and on their re
turn lo Seat He the w hole boat's load
was arrested and charged with mur
der because the sheriff and another
man had fallen in the fray.
"Not even the most vehement re
actionist will argue that the men were'
not exercising a perfectly constitu
tional right in attempting to land at
Everett Nobody w ill deny, in fact it I
is cynically admitted, that the sheriff
acted merely as the agent of the
Commercial Club, The only defense,
made, and it is made with absolute
effrontery and disdain, is that if the
Commercial Club did not like these
people to come Into Everett, they had
the right to prevent their entry into
Everett, even by force of arms and in
violation of all cojistitutior.nl author
ity."
That Hi's statement by an impartial
Student of economic affairs is n mild
indictment of the sheriff and those
who supported him in the outrage is
proved by the facts that have finally
come out of the first confused account
or the fight. Below is the statement
of Mayor If. C. Gill, of Seattle, from
which city the three hundred or more
workers started for Everett. The
Mayor of Seattle declares, and his
record proves it, that he has no liking
for the 1. W. W., but a sense of justice
'nd a regard for the fundamental
fights of every citizen induced Mayor
Oil] to say to a reporter for the Se
attle Times:
"In the final analysis it will be
found these cowards in Everett who,
i without right or justification, shot
Into the crowd on the boat, were the
! murderers and not the I. W. W.'s.
"The men who met I he I. W. W.s at
the boat were a bunch of cowards.
They outnumbered the i. w. w.'s five
io one, and in spite of this they stood
there on the dock and fired into the
boat, I. W. W.s, innocent rs
and all.
"Mcßae, the sheriff, and his depu
ties had no legal right to tell the I.
W. W .'s or anyone else that they could
not land (here. When the sheriff put
his hand on the butt of his gun and
told them they could not land, he fired
the first shot, in the eyes of the law,
and the I. W. W.s can claim that they
BhtO in self-defense."
ALONG PEACEFUL LINES
Of the coming convention of the
State Federation of Labor In this city
the Tacoma Labor Advocate says:
"Everett Is the meeting place and
tin local unions of that city Intend to
how the union huiers who have
stirred up the turmoil, even to the
i ten of killing, that organised labor
of Washington has conducted and is
now conducting union affairs along
peaceful lines. Employers of union
labor in the shingle industry of
Everett have done everything In their
power to destroy the Shingle Weavers'
organization, broken wage promises
to the union men and peace promises
in the citizens of Everett, who wanted
to see fair play."
CITY REJECTS
EVERETT CLAIM
Claims filed with the city by rela
tives of victims of the Everett i. w.
W. battle, totaling $175,000. were all
rejected by the council Monday. The
relatives charged the city was re
sponsible for the affair, on the ground
thai H W. W.s were unlawfully per
mitted to assemble here, "with the
'.vowed purpose of committing an
Unlawful act.' —Tuesday's Star.

of $50 each. These men are Charged

These boys have been in the King

were mighty glad to escape from the

Laughable Error of Prosecution
A mosi absurd error of the Sno

I light this week. The newspapers
have been giving some space to the
case of J. M. Beyer, who has volun

authorities. Beyer was one of the men

'he was released with some men whose
cases had been dismissed. The au
thorities were thus guilty of the laugh
