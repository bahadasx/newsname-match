A Dair of jacks have been the cause
of considerable trouble over In Dub
lin township, and resulted Wednes
day in Martin Johnson of Van Wert
county, through his attorneys, Ritch
ie & Walters, and F. V. Short filing
a suit in replevin gainst Oliver Petro
and John Laukhart
Johnson, a horse buyer, so the al
legations are, arranged to pay Petro
and Laukhart a fixed sum of money
for a pair of five year old brown
horse mules. Several days later he
went " to the Laukhart home, gave
Mrs. Laukhart a note for the sum
agreed upon, and went to the stable
and took the jacks. Petro ana Laun
hart were unable to obtain on the
note at local banks. They thereup
on went to Lima, where Johnson had
taken the mules for sale, took pos
session of them and had Johnson ar
rested for burglary.
Johnson now comes back with the
replevin action filed in Common Pleas
Court Wednesday praying for recov
ery of the two mules and damage
from the defendants in the sum of
15, with interest and costs.

tries by President Wilson
Warring Powers Urgea to Make Avowal of Views As to
Terms Upon Which Hostilitts May Be Ended
and Lasting Peace Secured.
Washington, December 20. Pres
ident Wilson has appealed to all the
belligerents to discuss terms of peace.
Without actually proposing peace
or offering meditation, the President
has sent formal notes to the Govern
ments of all the warring nations sug
gesting that "an occasion be sought
to call out from the nations now at
war such an avowal of their respec
tive views as to the terms upon which
the war might be concluded, and the
arrangements which would be deem
ed satisfactory as a guarantee against
Us renewal or the kindling of any
similar conflict in the future, as
would make it possible frankly to
compare them."
Wholly without notice and entire
ly contrary to what Administration
officials have described as his course,
the President Tuesday night dis
patched the notes to all the belliger
ents and to all the neutrals for their
nformation, a portion of which is
here subjoined:
"The President, feels altogether
Justified In suggesting an immediate
opportunity for a comparison of views

those objects on both sides. Never
yet have the authorltlve spokesman
of either side avowed the precise
which would, if attained, satisfy them
and their people that the war had
been fought out. The world has been
left to conjecture what definitive re
sults, what actual exchange of guar
anties, what political or territorial
changes or readjustments, what stage
of military success even, would bring
the war to an end.
"It may be that peace is nearer
that we know; that the terms which
the belligerents on the one side and
on the other would deem it necessary
to Insist upon are not so lrreconcili
able as some have feared; that an
Interchange of views would clear the
way at least for conference and make
the permanent concord of the nations
a hope of the immediate future, a
concei t of nations immediately prac
ticable. "The President Is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering medi
tation. He is merely proposing that
soundings be taken that we may
learn, the neutral nations with the
belligerent, ho wthe haven of peace
may be for which all mankind longs
with an intnse an dincreasing long
ing. He believes that the spirit in
which he speaks and the objects
which he seeks will be understood by
all concerned, and he confidently
hopes for a response which will bring
a new light into the affairs of the
world."

Now Open for Traffic.
The Celina-Wabash iiiti-r-cnuuty high

several months for the construction)!
the first section of that road, extending
from the corporotion line west, was
again opened for traffic yesterday, and
the public in general will be glad to
learn of the fact.
It is nearly five weeks since tht last

Last Sunday Mr. Ilurnett phoned to this
city that the road was in fit condition to
be opened but the engineer in charge

The fire laddies were called to the

put the stick of wood in the stove,
but as it was too large, he placed it
back in the wood box, near the stove,
not noticing the bark had taken fire,
and left the house. One side of the
house was badly damaged.

an arduous task to get started, but
he got away, made a short flight and
easily alighted on the broad expanse
of the ice covered pond. Celina peo

MIRACULOUS
Kscape from Fatal Injuries Made
by Ed Plerstorff, Ilopcwell
Township Man.
Ed Pierstorff, aged 35 years, of
Hopewell twp., was badly bruised
up, but luckily escaped fatal injuries
last Monday evening, when be was
thrown under a three ton Mogul gas
tractor, one of the big drive wheels of
which passed over the right leg from
the foot to the knee.
He was driving the machine borne
about dusk when the accident occurr
ed. Ho left the driver's seat and
went to the front of the machine to
adjust a valve. A sleeve of a Jacket
he was wearing caught In the revolv
ing wheel, and he was thrown to the
ground beneath the moving tractor.
Before he realized it, the big driving
wheel had caught his shoe. Unable
to pull the Bhoe off, he had presence
enough of mind to pull himself to
one side and bend the leg, the mach
ine running off at the knee. It was
several, minutes before he gained his
wits and by this tima the tractor had
gone on down the road some twenty
live feet. He got up and hopped
down the road to the machine, stop
ped it and then went Into a nearby
farm house for help. He was hur
ried to the office of Dr. Hattery,
where an examlnaton revealed that
no bones were broken, although the
leg was horribly bruised. His right
hand was also badly bruised and his
face and head bruised and cut. Had
his Jacket and sweater not been Dull
ed off he would probably have been
beaten to death. While not able to
use the leg he is seemingly gettnig
along nicely.
