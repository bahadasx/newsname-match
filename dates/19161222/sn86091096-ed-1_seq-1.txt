NUMBER 51
Lester Gifford Killed
Lester Gifford, a young farmer
residing seven miles east of Lewis
ton, was instantly killed shortly be
fore six o'clock last Saturday eve
~;£ning. The shooting occured at the
Idanha Pharmacy, where Gifford
had been driven at the point of a
gun by Jewell Freng.
The trouble started over a claim
for injuries which Freng alleges he
received last summer while driving
a header wagon for Gifford. He
demanded a check for $130 in pay
ment of the claim and told Gifford
that if the check were not paid im
mediately he would shoot him.
The two went into the Idanha
Pharmacy to secure a blank check
and while there Gifford told Mr.
Osmers, the proprietor, that Freng
was forcing him to give a check
and asked for advice in the matter.
He was told that the check would
not be good under such circum
stances and was advised to go ahead
and sign it.
Gifford made out the check and
gave it to Freng, when police offi
cer Gasser entered the store. Freng
seeing the officer, opened fire on
Gifford, who was trying to escape,
and shot him thru the left shoul
der, the bullet probably penetrat
ing the heart.
Freng was put under arrest and
confined in the county jail.
Gifford was twenty-three years of
age and was highly esteemed by
those who knew him. He was the
son of Mr. and Mrs. C. L. Gifford
of Lewiston. He was married
about a year ago and a daughter
was born to them only a few weeks
ago.
"Full Of Prunes"
H
How tjme has changed. Even us
young people can recall the time
when prunes were a standing joke,
and we spoke with contempt of the
prune. We sometimes said that a
person was "full of prunes," and
otherwise used the prune as a sym
bol of insanity. We made all man
ner of fun of this most excellent
article of diet, and laughed when
prunes were served. In those days
prunes retailed for about six cents
a pound, sometimes less, and were
in disrepute generally. In fact
prunes were a standing joke, and
suffered because people
making fun of a really splendid ar
ticle of diet. But today, 1916,
where is the humble prune? Who
of us can recall just how a prune
tastes, and remember its flavor?
Prunes! What crimes have been
committed in thy name! And we
are rather glad to find the prune
coming to its own, for today the
prune is one of the food aristocrats,
retailing at 20c a pound, and a
ooor man would have about as
fdch chance of getting "full of
prunes" as would a republican
carrying South Carolina. We drop
ped into a local store the other day
and inquired the latest quotation
on dried prunes.
insisted on
ed cents a lb,"
said the clerk. We bought one
which we expect to have cooked for
our Christmas dinner. But we are
almost sorry for our extravagance.
Prunes are now beyond the country
editor, and the poor man with a
prune appetite had better forget it.

Hogs Said To Be Scarce
Hogs are reported
prairies and in the Clearwater sec
tions and prices paid for some ship
ments in that country this week
were nine and a quarter cents a
pound. It is stated that farmers
are feeding few hogs for the mar
ket because of the high price of all
grains and the uncertainty of the
hog market. It is predicted that
record prices will prevail before
April.

The Games at Troy.
The basket ball games at Troy
last Saturday between the Kendrick
H. S. boys' and girls' teams and
the Troy High School teams, re
sulted in a victory for the Kend
rick boys' team by a score of 25 to
7. The girls' game was called a tie.
The girls played according to
girls' rules. At the end of the
game the score stood 9 to 10 in fav
or of Kendrick but as one of the
Kendrick girls had made three per
sonal fouls during the game, one
score was given to Troy as a forfeit.
This is according to girls' rules and
was perfectly proper.
The two teams went from here
in a big bob sled, Miss Abrahamson
chaperoning the crowd. A good
time was reported and the best of
treatment received from the Troy
people. A return game will prob
ably be played later.

CHRISTMAS CHEER
I
' 'The cheer of Christmas covers every creed.
"There is no heart so hard, no home so humble
that does not feel something of the softening in
fluence of the season. The bright eyes, ex
pectant faces, announce, everywhere that
'Christmas is coming!'
"Christmas is indeed the green letter day of
the year, for we decorate our homes with holly,
the ivy, the mistletoe, and our hearts with
greener memories.
"But the real spirit of thé day—the grand op
portunity— is wholly lost to every life who fails
to bring into so^ne other life a portion of the
brightness and beauty of the season."
New Pressing Establishment
Mr. and Mrs. H. S. Shuster and
child of Republic, Washington
moved here last week. Mr. Shus
ter has started a clothes cleaning
and pressing establishment in the
rooms next to Dr. Hoyt's office. He
has had a lot of experience in this
business and turns out first class
work. He also blocks hats and does
tailoring. He is also considering
the advisability of putting in a
small steam laundry and if the bus
iness will justify, enlarging the
equipment to meet the needs of the
community. He used to run a
laundry of his own so has had the
necessary experience. Kendrick
has long needed a first class clothes
pressing establishment.- Give Mr.
Shuster your business and give him
a good start here.
Six Cars Bean Friday
Six carloads of beans were ship
ped out of Kendrick last Friday.
Three were loaded out by the Kend
rick Warehouse and three by the
Kendrick Rochdale Co. The six
carloads figured on a basis of 8
cents a pound made a shipment ag
gregating close to $50,000. The
beans were shipped to eastern and j
southern points, some going as far
as New York City, New Orleans
and even to Cuba.
The bean shipments for the 1916
crop from this section alone, will
reach approximately 140 carloads,
valued at close to half a million
dollars. Potlatch beans are be
coming more widely known every
year and as the quality is first class
this means better markets. If the)
season is favorable next year will
see the largest acreage of beans
that has ever been planted in this

school land located within the
northern counties of the state, in
each instance this being the first
sale of school land taking place in
either of the counties named within
the past three years. Heretofore
the laws of the state permitted the
sale of but 16,000 acres of school
land annually, and for the past
three years the sales have been con
fined to acreage in the southern
part of the state,
! The act regulating the sale of
school land has been so amended as
to permit of 64,000 acres to be of
fered for sale annually. In the
sales announced to . take place next

as high as $25 an acre, being fine
for agricultural pursuits. On much
of the land tobe offered, the tim
ber has already been sold, with five
years yet to run before its removal
is compelled, and this is well adapt

land there is but a small amount of
standing timber, having been well
cleared in years past,
