FRANCHISE TO COMPETING
CONCERN HERE.
Authority to construct and operate
a central steam heating plant and an
other electric power and lighting
plant in this city, upon which con
struction is to be undertaken within
18 months and which will represent,
It is said, an investment of from
$75,000 to SIOO,OOO, was granted the
American District Steam company in
a 25-year franchise passed by the
city council at its regular meeting
Tuesday night. It marks the last im
portant official act of the administra
tion which has governed the city for
the past four years, the new city offi
cers and councilmen taking up their
duties January 2.
The franchise was first proposed
several weeks ago and, after its intro
duction, was considered by the coun
cil as committee of the whole in sev
eral secret meetings, until amended
to suit a majority. It waß carried by
a vote of five to two, Councilmen
Maynard and Draham opposing, and
is printed among the "City Legal No
tices" on page 6 of this issue.
City May Buy Plant.
The change from the 50-year to a
25-year franchise was made during
Tuesday night's meeting, as a result
of the statement by Councilman Mc-
Cllntlc that he opposed a longer
grant. At the end of the first 10
jenrs the city is authorized to take
ovei the property at a price to be
fixed Ly a board of three arbitrators,
as failing to exercise the privilege
at that time, may do so at the end
of any five-year period thereafter.
The company is to pay the f city a 1
per cent gross earnings tax monthly.
Just about the tlm» this franchise
was prupo' ed, the Olympia Light &
Power company announced that it
would construct a $40,000 steam aux
iliary plant in connection with its
hydro-electric plant at Tumwater.
The construction of this new unit.
•» liich it was said would amplv supply
•(k power demands of the cit/ for a
cumber of years, was the chief argu
iiept adva iced by C»inciliuen May
nard and Draham against the grant
ing of a franchise to a competing
electric company, though both stated
they would vote for a steam-heating
franchise.
The discussion over the ordinance,
while not excited, brought forth sev
eral talks from Mayor Mottman in
favor of it, during which he paid his
respects to the Olympla Light & Pow
er company, recounted considerable
of Us early hlßtory, and made the as
sertion that public service commis
sions of thiß and all the other states
are "a farce as far as the rights of
the people are concerned."
No doubt la held that the Ameri
can District Steam company will ac
cept the franchise, though the grant
la only for a 25-year term. Much
of the construction work is already
done and the remainder is to be start
ed next spring. The uew project will
be a completion of that undertaken
a couple of years ago by Wilbur B.
Foshe.y and Millard Luuon.
THREE SEEK CITIZENSHIP.
Two Get mans and Dane Apply for
Naturalization Papers Here.
Two Germans and a native of Den
mark applied for citizenship papers
at the county clerk's office, one of
them being Carl Johannes Petersen,
who left Germany three years ago in
a wind-jammer for a South Ameri
can port, waß interned with the boat
at Santa Rosalia, Mexico, when the
war broke out, but managed to leave
Bine months later by a schooner for
a California port working his way up
the coast to Olympia.
Carl Whittig. another German, told
Clerk I. N. Holmes that he had
planned to go back to the old coun
try some day, but had changed his
mind since the war started, because
"taxes are going to be awful when
the war is over." He was born in
Saxony, but came to the United States
in 1910. P. J. Niellsen, a native of
Denmark and an old deep-sea sailor,
has made his home in the United
States since 1892, and took out his
application for second papers and will
be given a hearing before the federal
examiner next March.

BANNER POSTOFFICE YEAR.
Monday Biggest Day in History—
-1010 Receipt* Approach 960,000.
When 144 sacks of parcel post
packages and 17 pouches of first-class
mail were sent out of the Olympia
postoffice last Monday, the biggest
day's business in the history of the
local office was recorded, according to
Postmaster James Doherty. The
number of sacks of mail matter sent
out of the city each day since have
approached that number and it is ex
pected that it will be exceeded before
the week is over.
Nineteen sixteen also promises to
be the banner year for the total
amount of business transacted by the
local office, the present expectations
of its officials being that it will run
close to the $60,000 mark, while the
highest previous year's receipts was
$54,000. Incidentally, all the em
ployes of the office are hoping this
year's total does reach $60,000, as it
will mean a salary boost all around.
LARGEST POULTRY
SHOW ill PROGRESS
MOKE THAN 500 BIRDS DIS
riiAYEI) IN ANNUAL EXHIBIT
OF LOCAL ASSOCIATION.
There isn't an empty coop in the
jtwo big rooms in the Elks' building.
I where the annual show of the Thurs
' ton County Poultry & Pet Stock asso
ciation is in progress—the display is
largest and best ever held here, well
I arranged, finely cooped, excellently
lighted and prettily decorated. More
than 500 birds are on display, includ
ing the largest exhibit of the Cornish
Ivariety that Frgpk Breed, a well-
I known poultry judge, says has ever
been held on the Pacific Coast.
Officers of the association are very
much pleased at the size and charac
ter of the exhibit and at the number
of visitors who are attending. The
show was officially opened Wednesday
morning and will be continued each
afternoon and evening until Saturday.
! Secretary T. P. Horn, of the associa
tion, has personal charge of the af
fair. and it is largely due to hard
iwork on his part that the show is as
| large as it Is.
, Classes Large, Quality High.
All of the classes are large and the
quality of the birds Is said to be ex
ceptionally high, one of the officials
stating that there "aren't four poor
birds In the lot." In addition to a
large representation from thl pens of
members of the association, there are
exhibits from all parts of the state,
Oregon and ferltish Columbia, and for
many of them It is their first entry
Into the local show.
The unusually large exhibit of Cor
nish fowls Is due to the fact that the
annual meet of the state division of
the American Cornish club Is being
held In connection with the local
show, the members of that organl
j zatlon making a much larger showing
than any previous year.
The five big classes are the Cor
nish. Barred Rock, White Leghorn,
(white Wyandotte and Rhode Island
Red. There are Buff Leghorns from
! Oregon, Black Orpingtons from Walla
' Walla, White Cornish from Vancou-
Iver, B. C., and various Individual ex
hibits from Aberdeen. Hoquiam, Win
lock. Everson, Seattle, Auburn and
Puyallup, and from various points In
Eastern Washington.
Children's Exhibit flood.
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the entire display is the sec
tion given over to the exhibits by the
members of the boys' and girls' divis
ion of the local association, including
entries of rabbits as well as poultry.
The pet stock division of the general
display, by the way. is an exception
ally good one and is proving inter
esting to visitors.
The local show has more than
doubled in size during the last two
or three years, and the officers expect
it to continue to grow until it be
comes one of the leading shows in the
state. Heretofore the nnmber of en
tries has usually been from 2CO to
300. so that this year's total of over
500 is highly satisfactory to the pro
moters. There were only 057 entries
in the big show in Seattle last week.
The officer'' of the local association
are R. A. Lee, president: O. A. Tor
ge*on. vice president, and T. P.
Horn, secretary.

Foiling for Two Years.
Mr. Murphy's health and strength
had waned rapidly ever since the at
tack of blood-poisoning two years ago
last June, which necessitated the am
putation of his right foot. From that
time on he was confined indoors most
of the time, being taken out only oc-
caßionally in a wheel chair. His
strength had ebbed so fast in the last
few days that his death had been
hourly expected and the children liv
ing down-Sound were summoned to
Olympia so that thfi entire family was
at the bedside when he passed away.
His passing markß the end of the
career of a man who played a lead
ing and prominent part in the history
of the territory and state and whose
record as an editor led to the most
unique tribute ever given a man in
that profession in this state when
[editors and pioneers from all parts
of the Northwest gathered in this
city in 1910 and gave a banquet in
jhiß honor, and presented him with a
i loving cup, in celebration of the fif
! tieth anniversary of The Washington
i Standard, founded by him November
| 17 1860. and edited by him for fifty-
Itwo years, until taken over by th<'
I present management August 1. 1912.
Mr. Murphy was born near Fort
Wayne, Ind., November 3, 1839. His
mother died when he was seven year.*
old and he went to live with his sis
ter. Mrs. George Barnes, at Cincin
nati. 0.. and four years later made
the trip across the plains wi h the
Barnes family. They spent the win-
ter of 1850 in Portland and came on
to Olympia in the spring.
A little while later young Murphy
returned to Portland, entering the
first school there, and in 1856 went
to work on the Oregon Weekly Times
of that city. Two years later he was
made foreman of the Democratic
Standard and then he went to Oregon
City and worked for a time for the
Argus of that city.
Resident Here Since 1860.
In 1860, in partnership with L. E.
V. Coon, he established the Chronicle
at Vancouver, Wash., but he soon de
cided that Olympia offered him a bet
ter field, and so he returned here to
establish The Washington Standard
! November 17 of that year. He made
his home here from that time until
his death.
! Three years later he was appointed
territorial printer and in 1865 he
constructed the building 'at Second
and Washington streets in which the
Standard was published during the
long years of hiß management of It.
He served three terms as territorial
auditor, from 1867 to 1870, from
1873 to 1874, and from 1888 to
statehood. He also served as a mem
ber of the Olympia city council for
years, was responsible for the organ
ization of a volunteer fire depart
ment here, was county superintend
ent of schools for one term and also
served as quartermaster during terri
torial days. In 1890 he built the
Olympia theater, bringing as the first
attraction "Little Lord Fauntleroy."
Relatives Who Survive.
Mr. Murphy was married in Port
land in 1861 to Miss Eliza A. Mc-
Guire, and to them 10 children were
born, only three of whom are now
living: Frank of this city, Charles
of Tacoma, and Mrs. Stella Carroll,
of Seattle. His first wife died In
1895 and in 1899 Mr. Murphy was
married to Susan Sprague who sur
vives. Eight grandchildren are liv
ing: Mrs. Ethel Cook and Leslie
Carroll, of Seattle; John H. Murphy
of this city; Stanley Murphy, of Se
attle; Irwin and Frank Murphy, of
Tacoma. and James and Joseph Har
ris, of Bremerton.
Ourlng all his life Mr. Murphy was
a staunch Democrat, except during
f t v c v, r period, when he sup
ported President Lincoln and the
I'nion party. Many anecdotes are
told n' Ms enu u " ic comment, one of
ttiese being to the effect tliat he was
once challenged to a duel by a fed
eral office-holder who was dismissed
under the Lincoln administration.
Mr. Murphy's comment on the chal
lenge was so devastating that the
challenger vanished.

"PEMiUT POLITICS"
TO CLOSE MANSION
GOVERNOR LISTER ANNOUNCES
HE WILL RENT PRIVATE
HOUSE AFTER APRIL 1
"Peanut politics" of the last cam-
palgn, indulged in by various local
Republican politicians, lassisted by
the bureau of inspection of the state
auditor's office, the Perkins' Press
and Republican newspapers of other
cities, had its fruition Thursday
when Governor Lister announced
that he had definitely made up his
mind to close the executive mansion
April 1, when the present appropria
tion expires, and to rent a private
home in this city for the next four
years.
The announcement followed the
publication of stories to the effect
that he and State Treasurer Ed
Meath, another member of the state
finance board, had disagreed over the
appropriation to be allowed during
the next two years for the mainte
nance of the mansion, and that as a
result no appropriation would be in
cluded in the budget. Governor Lis
ter brands these stories as entirely
false, stating that there was no dis
agreement over the appropriation,
but simply that Treasurer Meath had
wanted him to continue to live in
the mansion and that he had made
up his mind he would* not do so.
j Personal attacks upbn the gover
: nor during the campaign, including
that he had tried to put
, through Improper claims against
I the mansion maintenance funds, and
attempts to ridicule him In various
cartoona, coupled with speeches
1 made by various local politicians,
are what prompted him to the decis
ion to close the executive mansion.
"There are so many more import
ant matters coming before the gov
ernor every day in the year that I
don't propose to be subjected to that
sort of criticism during the next
four years from the people who run
this town," the governor said, in dis
cussing his decision. "My decision
is final—the executive mansion will
Ibe closed after the legislative ses
l sion."
BOTTLE-HOUSE IS MOVED.
Location Changed to Plant at Tum
water—New Machinery Installed.
The bottle-house of the old Olym
pia Brewing company, located south
of the Northern Pacific depot for the
past 10 years, is being moved to the
plant of the Northwest Fruit Products
company at Tumwater, where, after
the Installation of some new machin
ery, It will be used to bottle the com
pany's new drink, "Applju." The lo
cation was changed to facilitate the
handling of the product.
Officials of the company expect to
have the bottle-house in operation by
the last of January, and it will be
kept running steadily from then until
the apple-pressing season next fall.
Quite a large crew will be employed,
but the company is installing labor
saving machinery which reduces the
number of necessary employes.
Governor Lister has not yet re
ceived an answer from Secretary of
War Raker to his telegram of last
Friday, urging the war department
to release Troop B Cavalry and Com
\. v| o ]ri signal Corps, of the
Washington National Guard, from
further duty on the border, though
it had been expected It woulld be an
swered immediately.
WHOLE NUMBER 2939
PRESIDENT URGES
PEACE DISCISSION
FORMALLY ASKS ALL BELLIG
ERENTS TO STATE TERMS
FOR ENDING WAR.
Wholly without notice and entire
ly contrary to what administration
officials have described as his course.
President Wilson Wednesday night
dispatched notes to all the belliger
ents in the European war, urging a
discussion of the terms o£ peace, and
to all the neutrals for their informa
tion.
Summarized in the president's own
words as contained in the notes, his
attitude is as follows:
The president is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering media
tion. He is merely proposing that
soundings be taken in order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with
the belligerent, how near the haven
of peace may be for which all man
kind longs with an intense and in
creasing longing.
Hopes for Light.
He believes that the spirit in
which he speaks and the object*
which he seeks will be understood by
all concerned, and he confidently
hopes for a response which will bring
a new light into the affairs of the
world.
Without actually proposing peace
or offering mediation, the president
formally suggested to the govern
ments of the warring nations that
"an early occasion be sought to call
out from the nations now at war
such an avowal of their respective
views as to the terms upon which
the war might be concluded and the
arrangements which would be
deemed satisfactory as a guarantee
against its renewal or the kindling
of any similar conflict in the future,
p.s would make it possible frankly to
compare them."
The dispatch of the notes was a
most distinct surprise to all official
Washington, which had been led to
believe that with the formal trans
mittal of the proposals of the central
powers the offices of the United
States would await farther moves
between the belligerents themselves
and that certainly, in view of the
speech of Premier Lloyd George and
the announcements In Russia. France
and Italy, that the allies would re
ject the German proposals, further
action by neutrals would depend up
on the next careful and delicate
moves of the belligerents.
Improves Peace Prospects.
The whole tenor of official opin
ions throughout Washington, when
the president's action became known,
was that It Immeasurably improved
the prospects for some sort of ex
change looking toward an approach
to peace discussions between the
belligerents without Impairing the
position of the United States should
they finally be unable to find a good
ground on which to approach one
another.
At the White House no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
whether any of the powers even had
intimated how they would receive
the note, and there was every Indica
tion that the same careful secrecy,
which prevented anything whatever
becoming known about the presi
dent's action until it had been taken,
would surround any of the succeed
ing moves.
Diplomats consider it incredible
that the president would bring for
ward such a proposal at such a time
unless he had reason to believe It
would receive respectful considera
tion at the hands of all the belliger
ents and above all would not preju
dice the position of the United States
as a possible mediator.
Dairymen Meet Sa«ur<la,v.
President L. R. Campbell, of the
Dairymen's association, urges all
members of tbat organization and
farmers generally who are Interested
In the Improvement of livestock, to
attend the meeting to be held at tho
Chamber of Commerce at 1 o'clock
Saturday afternoon, when the pro
posal to organize a breeders' associa
tion In the county will be further dis
cussed.
