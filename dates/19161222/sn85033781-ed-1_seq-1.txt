Christmas in Ionia.
PAW PAW, MICHIGAN, FRIDAY DECEMBKR 22, 1916
1 am thinking of you today because it is Christmas, and
I wish you happiness. And to-morrow, because it will be
the day after Christmas, I shall wish you happiness; and so
on clear through the year. I may not be able to tell you
about it every day, because I may be far away; or because
both of us may be very busy. But it makes no difference.
The thought and the wish will be here just the same.
Whatever joy or success comes to you will make me glad.
Without pretense, and in plain words, good will to you is
what I mean, in the spirit of Christmas.
Henry Van Dyke
AND THIS IS OUR CHRISTMAS

BIG BUSINESS FOB

Over the County. High
Class of Work.
NO EFFORT TO COMPETE WITH
'Mail Order" Concerns, on
Same Class of Building
Material
Few people in this community have
any idea of the magnitude of the
lumber business transacted by the
Free, Hall and Mutchler company of
Paw Paw. The member of this com
pany are John W. Free, Wm. H. Hail
and John Mutchler. The two latter
are the active members in the opera
tions of the concern. Both are quiet
unassuming gentlemen, who never go
out with a brass band to advertise
their business, but as the saying goes
"They are on the job, and are sawing
wood every minute."
It is worth a trip to the mills of
this company, to look over their splen
did equipment and see the class of
work they are doing. They are pre
pared to do all kinds of work in the
building 'line and there is hardly a
day in the year when they are not
busy getting out a big bill of lumber
and building material for some big
job.
Last week they shipped a ear load
of lumber to W. H. Buell of Kalama
zoo who is putting up a big forty by
sixty-eight foot barn. They have al
so recently completed a bill of work
for South Haven, CoveH and South
Bend parties. They draw plana,
manufacture the doors, windows and
even the furniture, if it is desired.
