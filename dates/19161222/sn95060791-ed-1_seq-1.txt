CHAPMAN CHARGES GRAFT
The Self - Appointed Censor of
Public Morals Alleges that There
is Graft in the County Printing
Contract Claims to Want a
Grand Jury Investigation. The
News will Welcome Such Inves
tigation.
"Redeemer" Chapman, editor
of the Winslow Mail, gathered a
handful of filth last week and
slung it at some of the county
officials and The Holbrook News.
He suggests that, "it is now time
the county attorney called his
grand jury together again, if he
is still desirous of knowing just
how much the countv printing
graft cost the taxpayers the past
year." And he further states
that "it was one of the rawest
steals ever pulled off in this
county, and that is going some
when the records are examined."
As every one knows who has
taken the trouble to ascertain the
true facts, the printing contract
was let to the proprietor of The
Holbrook News last January by
the board of county supervisors
because the bid submitted by
him was considered the lowest
and best. There were two other
bids submitted and both of these
were considered higher than the
one submitted by the owner of
the News.
The proprietor of the News
gave bond for the faithful per
formance of his contract, and so
far as he knows the specifications
of the contract have been com
plied with. At least he has never
yet been advised by the. super
visors that he is not doing the
work according to contract. It
would seem, however, that in
filling the terms of his contract,
and collecting money for work
done and supplies furnished, the
owner of The News has laid him
self open to an accusation of
"grafting," and of pulliug off a
"raw steal."
Such an accusation made by
any other person than the holier-than-thou
editor of the Mail
might cause us some concern.
Made by that self-appointed
censor of the morals of the com
munity it is not worthy extended
refutation, although we refer to
it casually in order that we may
suggest a course of action for
that representative of decadent
journalism who is now in charge
of the Winslow Mail.
It is not necessary for a grand
jury to be called to investigate
the so-called "printing graft."
Let the alleged editor of the
Mail swear toa complaint setting
forth his charges of graft, and
it can be brought immediately
before the courts. This will save
the taxpayers, of whose interest
he is so solicitous, the cost of a
grand jury investigation. And
it will accomplish the same result.
File your complaint, Mr. Chap
man, and make the owner of The
News and the county supervisors
parties to the suit. You claim
that evidence of a "steal" ex
ists, now make good your state
ments by proving it! Your fail
ure to do this should brand you
forever as a liar and a filthy de
famer of character a disgrace
to the profession you encumber.
We know you will not file any
complaint and we know you would
not go before a grand jury if one
were called, unless you were
forced to do so. When the last
grand jury was in session it is
believed you were asked to fur
nish proof of some of the unlaw
ful things you had from time to
time alleged in your organ of scur
rility, but it seems you suffered
a paralysis of the yocal organs
and remained dumb. So it would
be again. You haven't the in
formation to divulge and you
haven't the courage to give it if
you had it.
We know you to be a liar when
you charge a steal in the print
ing contract, and we should relieh
the opportunity of provinar you a
cowardly liar in a court of record.
Hence we say to you, Mr. Chap
man, file your complaint of graft
in the printing contract and
prove, if possible, that you are
not also a cur.
Why?
Will some railroad official, or
any other person who knows,
kindly advise the News why it is
necessary for east bound trains
to take water from the stand-
pipe east of the Holbrook station,
and westbound trains to take
wflfrpr from the filándome west
of the station? Or is it necessary?
If not necessary, why is it almost
invariably done by the crews of
long freight trains?
Because of- this custom every
train that stops at the Holbrook
station for water blockades the
main crossing near the depot
from 5 to 15 minutes. At times
two trains bound in opposite di
rections arrive close together.
One train may keep the crossing
blocked for 15 minutes and be
fore it has cleared the crossing
the other train forms a blockade.
In this way the crossing may be
blocked for 20 or 30 minutes.
We have been informed that
the railroad company has a rule
that trains bound in either di
rection are required to stop at
the nearest waterpipe. If there
is such a rule, the enginemen pay
no attention to it, and usually do
the reverse. If there is not
such a rule, there should be one,
and the business men of Holbrook
should see that it is enforced.
There is not a citizen of Holbrook
who does not lose several hours
time in the course of a year wait
ing for trains to clear the cross
ings near the depot. Figure the
money value of the time lost and
each person is out several dollars
each year.
The amount of time (money)
lost by the average citizen in one
year would more than pay that
citizen's proportionate share of
the cost of maintaining an incor
porated town; and in an incor
porated town the railroad com
pany wouM hot be permitted to
obstruct crossings at the will of
its employes.
Why not incorporate?

The Hunt-Campbell Contest
Last Monday in the superior
court of Maricopa county Judge
Sanford ruled that the contest of
Governor Hunt against momas
E. Campbell, governor elect, was
not entitled to a hearing. In
making the ruling Judge San-
ford gave as a reason the fact
that Campbell had not been
issued his certificate of election
and that until the certificate of
election had been issued Hunt
had no. grounds for contest.
Hunt's attorneys at once asked
for an injunction restraining the
secretary of state from issuing a
certificate to Campbell. Camp
bell's attorneys entered a de
murrer to this and the demurrer
was sustained by Judge Sanford. i
An appeal to the supreme court i
was then taken by the Hunt at-1
torneys, and a decision will be ;
rendered by that court December 1
28.
J. W. Richards, treasurer of
Navajo county, had received an
order from Judge Sanford Mon
day to bring the ballots cast in
this county to Phoenix for ex
amination. He had arranged to
leave Holbrook Tuesday evening
with the ballots, but shortly be
fore his train left he received a
telegram from Judge Sanford re
scinding his former order. The
ballots will therefore not be taken
to Phoenix at this time.
The issues in the Hunt-Campbell
contest will probably be tried
in the supreme court. Contests
for county officers, in counties
where they have been filed, will
be postponed until the governor
ship contest is settled.
The outstanding features in
the battle for the governorship
of Arizona Thursday according
to the Phoenix Gazette were the
capitulation of Secretary of State
Osborn who issued a certificate
of election to the governor-elect,
and a stipulation under which
the appeal to the supreme court
is withdrawn and the inspection
of ballots resumed under Judge
Stanford's jurisdiction.
It now appears certain that
Campbell will take the oath of
office and become governor of
Arizona on January 1st. It is
also increasingly probable that
Gov, Hunt will refuse to give up
physical possession of the office.
In this event there will be two
sets of appointees; two messages
to the legislature which meets
January 8th; a sharp division in
the legislature itself, and unless
a settlement is arrived at sooner
than now seems propable a pos
sible paralysis of all state func
tions. Important Notice
For the accomodation of late
Christmas shoppers we shall keep
our store open all day Sunday.
