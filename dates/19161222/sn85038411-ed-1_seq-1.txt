Washington. D. C., Dec. 22. With
the purposes of President Wilson's
note to belligerents clarified by official
statements on the subject, the atten-!
tion of the United States has turned
to the reception of the note in the
foreign capitals.
Diplomats here are eagerly watch
ing for indications of whether the
Kuropean neutrals will follow the
lead of the United States and make
a similar appeal to the warring pow
ers.
There is growing feeling that the
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for views and possibly
lor terms of the belligerents. Several
of the diplomats have advised their
governments to that effect in order to
guide them in their replies.
Surprise at the fast growing signifi

"We have two boys, 3 and 4 years

least over the Christmas holiday,"

lias just been sent to the hospital.
They have nobody to care for them.
We have them at the Associated

Powerful Liquor Interests
of France Are Fighting
Ban Tooth and Nail
Paris, Dec. 21. Premier Briand's
proposal to suppress the manufacture
and sale of spirits which is generally
approved by the public is being fought
tooth and nail by the powerful liquor
trade interests. The National Wine
and Spirit Trade Association at a spe
cial meeting has passed a resolution
strongly condemning the premier's
proposal. Among the arguments ad
vanced at the meeting was that the
measure dissolves the sacred union of
the country before the foe by at
tacking one class of citizens, that it is
a violation of the right of every citi
zen to trade and that it amounts to ex
propriation. It was also urged that
those affected would be entitled by
law to indemnities which would swal
low up hundreds of millions of francs
and that the measure would suppress
| one of the most lucrative branches of
France's export trade.

The pine tree, which will be illumi

SPROUL ENTERS
GUBERNATORIAL
CAMPAIGN TODAY
Announcement Made in Dela
ware County; Democrats
Boosting MeCormick
The Telegraph vo-day received a
special dispatch from Philadelphia to
the effect that Senator William C.
Sproul, of Chester, had announced his
candidacy for Governor in 118 at a
meeting of Republican workers of his
county and that Democratic State
leaders and national officials had
launched a boom for Vance C. Me-
Cormick for the Democratic nomi
nation.
The dispatch is as follows:
"Senator William C. Sproul, of Dela
ware county has formally announced
his candidacy for Governor to succeed
Martin U. Brumbaugh. This an
nouncement was received in political
circle almost simultanously with the
action of President Wilson's Pennsyl
vania leaders, who launched a definite
gubernatorial boom for Vanco C. Mc
j l%rmick, chairman of the Democratic
I National committee.
Mr. Sprout's announcement was
made at a meeting of the Republicans
of Kldley township, who were the
guests of James F. Dougherty, of Lip
erviile, and was the most unique an
nouncement of a gubernatorial candi
dacy In the history of the State
Senator Sproul was surrounded by
a complete vaudeville show when he
made his announcement. Conjurers,
strong men, singers and clog dancers
appeared on the platform before he
"accepted" the nomination to lead the
tight against the Vare-Brumbaugh
| Magee forces in 1918, and after he had
delivered his speech in which he de
clared war within the Republican par
ty on behalf of the "stalwarts" the
Republicans of Kldley township feast

No Strings Attached to Offer
of Bethlehem Steel, Greater
Than Krupp Works
MILLION ROUNDS A MONTH
Great Steel King Pledges Con
cern to Government at Own
Price; Welcomes Peace
New York, Dec. 22. The Bethle
hem Steel plant, now fifty per cent,
greater than the great Krupp works
at Essen, will be turned over to the
United States government the moment
that it is needed, and without any
strings attached.
Charles M. Schwab, head of the
great plant at Bethlehem, made this
pledge to a dinner table full of dis
tinguished publicists at the Lotos Club
and declared that the concern now
has a capacity of 1,000,000 rounds of
heavy ammunition a month.
"This," he declared, "I feel to be a
great national asset for the govern
ment. In the event the time comes
that it is needed, it will be placed at
| the disposal of the government to be
used as the government sees tit, and
the government Itself shall name the
price to be paid for the material pro
duced."
Mr. Schwab said he did not "fear"
the effect of peace on America's busi
ness.
"1 am an optimist," he said. "Some
see disaster in peace coming but I look
on peace as a blessing. What we want
is a conclusive peace and not one that
merely presages another war."
