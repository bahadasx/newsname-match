=s gave most officials the first notice that
such a step was even contemplated at

s. Opinion here inclined toward the
view that the action would give strong
encouragement to some .sort of ex
changes which might result in discus
slon of definite peace terms between
the belligerents. It was believed fur
»y ther that since the president seeks on
J"' ly a clarification of peace views and
does not offer mediation, the United
States will not be placed in an embar
'rassing position if the European na
tions should be unable finally to devel
.f5 op a basis on which to approach each
other.

London, Dec. 21. —The sugges
tion of the United States for an
exchange of view# among the bel
li% ligerents has been received at the
^foreign office and now is under
consideration, pending which no
"y statement will be made.
Washington, D. C., Dec.
21.—Distinct
surprise was apparent among diplo
•&. matic officials in Washington today
f~ji, over President Wilson's plea to Euro
pean belligerents to discuss peace
iv terms.
Officials of the British embassy de
dared they were wholly unable to ex-
pifiin the action.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
V'*- ambassador, said:
"Now, I am perfectly convinced that
there will toe a conference." He may
confer with Secretary Lansing today.
Expects Consideration.
'^Diplomatists think it is incredible
:v that President Wilson should have
taken this action without some belief
that it would not be flatly rejected
without consideration by the entente
allies. That he would take some such
,step, has been well known and there
is no doubt of the manner of its re-
$*1 ception among them.
Officials and diplomatists here an
alyzing the president's note find some
§V thing deeper than an appeal for con
sideration of peace terms. They see
that the president in acting was also
considering what would haye to be the
eourse of the United States to con
fht serve its interests as a neutral if the
f, war is to continue,
p, Neutrals Losino Patience.
Coupled with the president's recent
I*-' declaration that the position of neu
»*C trals was becoming intolerable, they
JVV attach much significance to his state
ment in the note that his suggestion
comes from a neutral whose interests
have been most seriously affected by
S. the war, "and whose concern for its
1
parly conclusion arises out of a manl
fest necessity to determine how best to
safeguard those interests if the war is
to continue."
The definite proposal of the United
States for "a league of nations to in
sure peace and justice throughout the
world" is interpreted as a step which,
If carried through, would mean the
abandonment of the theory of "splen-
18 attached to the fact that the presi-l™^
if dent uses the word "insure" rather iror
that he is open to whatever sugges
tions may seem best to the other world
nations.
To Abandon Policy.
Repeated efforts have been made to
enlist the American government in
some sort of international agreement
involving responsibility, but always
the answer has been that the United
States would stand alone. Several
months ago President WilBon spoke
most earnestly before the League to
Enforce Peace of his hope that the
United States would join in some new
international arrangements, but not
until now is he known to have made
the proposal officially to the nations of
the world.
It is thought here that along these
lines President Wilson's note will flnd
its most ready reception abroad, for
all parties have indicated their belief
that the war will have been in vain
unless from it comes guarantees
against the repetition.
All Favor a League.
Former Foreign Minister Sir Edward
Grey for England. Premier Briand for
Farnce and Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg for Germany have all com
mitted their nations to some sort of
International reorganization to Secure
the ends laid down in the president's
note, and the official offers of the cen
tral powers together with Lloyd

Lansing Tells
Wilson's Reason
For Sending Note
Washington, D. C., Dec. 21.—
Secretary Lansinn in a statement
today explaining the sending of
President Wilson's note to the bel
ligerents declared it was because
the situation for neutrals was be
coming increasingly critical and
the United |tates itself was being
drawn near the verge of war.
Secretary Lansing today author
ized the following statement:
"The reasons for the sending of
the note were as follows:
"It isn't our material interest
we had in mind when the note was
sent, but more and more our
rights are becoming involved by
the belligerents on both sides, so
that the situation is becoming in
creasingly critical
"I mean by that, that we are
drawing nearer the verge of war
ourselves and therefore we are en
titled to know exactly what each
belligerent seeks in order that we
may regulate our conduct in the
future.
"No nation has been sounded.
No consideration of the German
overtures or of the speech of
Lloyd George was taken into ac
count in the formulation of the
document. The only thing, the
overtures did was to delay it a few
days. It was not decided to send
it until Monday. Of course, the
difficulties that face the president
were that it might be construed as
a movement toward peace and in
aid of the Germaij overtures. He
kpeciflcally denies that that was
the fact in the document itself."
Secretary Lansing further said:
"The sending of thjs note will
indicate the possibility of our be
ing forced into the war. That pos
sibility ought to' serve as a re
straining and sobering force safe
guarding American rights. It may
also serve to force an earlier con
clusion of the war. Neither the
president nor myself regard this
note as a peace note: it is merely
an efTort to get tfie belligerents to
define the end for Which they are
fighting.*
In a speech at Pittsburgh last Janu
ary he said:
"When yon know that there are
combustible materials in the life of
the world and in your own national
life and that the sky is full of floating
sparks from a great conflagration, are
you going to sit down and say it will

WILSON FEARS WAR iSTSC?
Danger That U. 8. May Become In-
Washington, D. C., De^ 21.—The
danger of the United States itself be
ing drawn into the war, by reason of
its increasingly critical position as a
neutral, was one of the moving con
siderations in President Wilson's dis
patch of'notes to all the belligerents
urging them to discuss terms of peace.
President Wilson himself on several
occasions has pointed out the danger
of the United States becoming involv
ed in the war. Because of violations,
of American rights, lie has felt that
the United States had a very difficult
role to fill.
Last February while touring the
middle west in favor of preparedness
and again during the last campaign,
the president touched on that feature.

time may affect us, and yet we cannot

Again at Cleveland, Ohio, the presi
dent declared:
"Two-thirds of the world are at war.
It is not merely a European struggle
nations in the orient have become in

and everywhere there seems to be

BIS CHASM IN
PATH OF PEACE
German Papers Not Hopeful
of Ending War After
England's Reply
21.
(Via
London)—The
Berlin press which commented only
fragmentarily on Premier Uoyd
George's speech this morning, because
only excerpts were available, now has
the entire text and devotes its full at
tention to the subject The papers as
a whole express little surprise at the
British premier's attitude although
most wonder why he believes that en
tering into a conference would involve
the entente as placing its head in a
noose.
Lloyd George's references to restitu
tion and reparation are universally in
terpreted as an entente demand that
1
Germany surrender all occupied terrt
tory and probably pay an indemnity,
The Tageblatt says:
"TJoyd George is not willing to nego
tiate or willing only in case that Ger
many will submit to England's de
mands as summarized in his utter
ances regarding restitution, reparation
and guarantee. This makes the chasm
between the English and German
standpoint so broad that not even the
most cheerful optimist can find away
to bridge it. Lloyd George, in stipulat
ing the acceptance of his conditions
before the opening of negotiations
shows that he does not wish to nego
tiate."
The Tageblatt concludes by asking
whether all possibilities of peace have
now vanished and answers its own
question with a faintly hopeful refer
ence to various French socialist, Eng
lish and Italian voices as showing that
the peace overtures are not judged by
the public exactly as by the parlia
ments.
Pick Flaws In 8tand.
In the view of the Vossiche Zeitung
the reference to the ntose is nothing
more than a recognition by England
of Germany's strength and the failure
of the entente's military enterprises^

says, "that our enemies do not want

DOOR NOT CLOSED.
London, Dec. 21.—The Daily Mail,
which is close to Premier Lloyd
George, this morning gave prominence
to the following:
"The Germanic and neutral press
views on Mr. Lloyd George's refusal
of the German peace offer largely take
the standpoint that he did not close
the door to peace. The fectual fact,
however, is that he entirely declined
peace on anything except the allies'
terms and the door obviously remains
open only if Germany is willing to ac
cept those terms, which are complete
restitution, full reparation and effec
tual guarantees."
The Star, which, as well as the Daily
Mail, has pacificist tendencies, says
that Premier Lloyd George's state
ment that the British welcomed Ger
man development as long as it was on
the paths of peace has not received
the attention it merits.
"On the whole, the prospect before
humanity is not quite so black as it
was last Christmas," the Star contin
ues. "The nations have reached the
stage of talking about peace. If they
are talking at each other rather than
tatking to each other it is because the
dawn of peace is only starting to
break. There may be many weary
hours before dawn blossoms into sun
rise. but a faint light already is seen
in the eastern sky."

London, Dec. 21.—While the morn

American and other foreign comment
on Premier Lloyd George's speech, the
question of peace was sidetracked to

nation to mobilise. The description of

The civil conscripts,
according to these accounts, must
place themselves at the disposal of the
state for the duration of the war and
must consent to be transferred to any
part of the country where their ser
vices are needed. Filling the ranks
in the essential war industries such as
ship building, railroads and mines, will
be the first step. Enrollments will not,
however, be confined to manual work
ers and everybody .from the leisure
rich downwards must either volunteer
or eventually be forced into national
work. The employment will be allot
ted according to respective capacities.

DES MOINES MAYOR
FIGHTS COAL BfEN
BLOOMFTELD CONCERN ASKS IK
JUNCTION TO PREVENT SEIZ
URE OF FUEL CARS.
Des Moines, Dec. 21.—Mayor John
MacVicar won a victory out of court
today when he forced from representa
tives of wholesale coal dealers a prom
ise that none of their product would
be shipped out of Des Moines as long
as there was a single destitute family
in the city without coal.
After the mayor had given notice
that he would fight the injunction pe
tition, he issued a statement that un
less assurances were given that the
poor were to be taken care of he would
order the police department to seize
every car of fuel out bound from Des
Moines and would see to it that it was
distributed before injunction proceed
ings could be brought. The plaintiff
then agreed to distribute the coal
through the associated charities.
At today's council meeting the prop
osition of buying a coal mine and hav
ing the city operate it was considered
as a "war measure."
Petition for injunction was filed late
yesterday and service accepted by the
city clerk and other city officials after
the mayor had absented himself from
the city hall in the hope of escaping
service in case such a petition should
be filed.
An internal shakeup in the city hall
was predicted today by police officials
as the result of the mayor's action. It
was charged unofficially that some of
the city officials accepting service did
so in order to thwart the mayor's plan
because of MacVIcar's veto on some
previous occasion of measures they
had championed.
Hundreds of families reported to
the authorities today that they had no
coal and couid obtain none.
CHICAGO'S COAL
FAMINE AVERTED
Chicago, Dec. 21. —Coal wagons to
day were busy delivering 7,000 tons of
fuel to downtown office buildings, ho
tels and some of the city schools.
Coal dealers assert that the arrival of
the 7,000 tons from the West Virginia
fields, averted temporarily at least, the
possibility of a coal famine.
Chicago, Dec. 21.—William L. 0*Con
nell. chairman of the state public util
ities commission, began investigation
today of complaints that congestion
on the Chicago, Belt railway is large
ly responsible for the coal shortage in
Chicago. The complaints came from
both consumers and dealers.

Heavily In Value.
New York, Dec. 21. —President Wil
son's communication to the waning
powers and the subsequent comment
upon it by Secretary Lansing were
made the occasion of another tremen
dous liquidating movement in the stock
market today, which far exceeded in
scope the activity and session of the
past ten days.
Special stocks, notably those regard
ed as war issues, broke 4 to 13 points
during a wild opening, with declines of
1 to 3 points between sales. A quick
rally gave way after the noon hour to
another sweeping downward move
ment which followed the publication
of Secretary Lansing's statement.
Despite the declaration of an extra.
2 per cent dividend by Union Pacific
that stock showed an extreme loss of
5% points and Reading and other lead
ers in the railway division also fell
abruptly.
Total sales of all stocks during the
first two hoors reached the almost un
precedented total of 1,300,000 shares.
Total sales up to 1 o'clock approx
imated 2.000.000 shares indicating
that the full day's trading would prob

amount United States Senator Stone
alone contributed 574,900 shares.
