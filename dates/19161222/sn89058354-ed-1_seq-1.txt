"ELECTRICITY FOR
EVERY FARM," IS
WORKING SLOGAN
This Is Made Possible By Wonder
ful Little Device Which Is
Being Sold Here
With "Electricity For Every Farm"
is his working slogan, George S.
Tucker, formerly of Memphis, but
who is now located in this city, is
making a campaign throughout this
county demonstrating the Delco-
Light.
Mr. Tucker has as his territory
Henry, Carroll and Benton counties,
and is anticipating large sales by the
time he has made a thorough can
vass of his territory.
The Delco-Light is a complete elec
tric light and power plant, and can
be used for any light work around
the house as well as furnishing elec
tric lights. . It is small, and can be
installed anywhere, at any distance
from the house, and the necessary
wiring done. It operates by gaso
line, but the engine is not kept in
operation all the time, a short while
each day furnishing enough elec
tricity to meet the requirements.
While the engine is in operation
the electricity is generated and stor
ed in batteries, which never give
out. One set of batteries, it is said,
will last as long as the average man
cares to live.
Many of such lighting systems are
ia use by farmers throughout the
country, and the sales are growing
each year. It is pointed out by the
manufacturers of this convenience
and necessity that it is far safer than
any other light system, besides being
more convenient.
Mr. Tucker has an entire outfit
on the rear of an automobile, in
which he is calling on his prospec
tive purchasers, and is prepared to
demonstrate every feature of the
plant.

REV. H. C.
Died In Mempnis On Tuesday Af
ter Very Brief Illness Of
Pneumonia.
Rev. H. C. Johnson, who was well
known by many people in Paris and
Henry county, died in Memphis
Tuesday after a brief illness of pneu
monia. He was a brother of E. R.
Johnson, of this city, who was at his
bedside when the end came. Of the
funeral, Thursday's News Scimitar
has the following to say:
"Funeral services over the body
of the Rev. H. C. Johnson, one of
the best nown ministers in the city,
and pastor of the Second Methodist
church, were held Wednesday morn
ing at the. church of which he was
pastor. Prominent laymen acted as
pallbearers. The services were con

The body was forwarded to Jack
son, Tenn., at 12:40 p. m. Wednes

educated at Vanderbilt University."
BRUCE IS GUEST OF
HONOR AT BANQUET
Appreciation of His Ability A a
Sales Promoter Is Shown
By Client.
Mr. Ben Himelhoch, proprietor of
the New York Store, is so delighted
with the splendid results obtained
by Manager H. L. Bruce in the pro
motion of the Santa Claus Sale now
in progress that he had six o'clock
dinner served at the store on Satur
day evening last, all the clerks being
invited and Mr. Bruce being the
guest of honor.
The affair came in the nature of
a surprise to everybody, speculation
being rife as to the meaning of a
table set in the rear of the store,
covered with snowy linen, tinkling
china and sparkling glass, but the
lucky ones were not kept in igno
rance long, for promptly at the ap
pointed hour the store was tempo
rarily closed and waiters from Ma
theny's nearby cafe trooped in the
back door bearing trays laden with
more fried chicken, oysters, French
fried potatoes, pickles, coffee, etc.,
than would feed a regiment. -
Mr. Himelhoch took occasion to
say that he had known Mr. Bruce in
a passing way ever since he came to
Paris, but that he had learned to like
him socially and to, admire his busi
ness methods and ability during a
sale' put on for him in the summer,
and that this esteem had increased
during the present engagement, and
that the sale had been so successful

Sleif ht of Hand Stunt Pulled By the
Weather Man Is Great Surprise '
To Populace.
Old Man Winter played a return
engagement in this city the first
part of the week. He was ably as
sisted by the usual cast Snow, Ice
and North Wind; the applause, how
ever, was light.
The weather artist pulled some
kind of sleight of hand stunt last
Sunday night, making a swift change
from almost ideal weather on Sunday
to about a four-inch snowfall bright
and early Monday morning. It came
as a great surprise to everyone, as
the skies were clear at a late hour
Sunday night and the temperature
was "salubrious."
Some time during the night the
snow commenced. No one knows at
what hour, except possibly the night
minion of the law Chief H. Hancock.
The snow was accompanied by a
brisk breath of the North Wind,
which by daylight had turned almost
to a gale with blizzard weather
threatening. The snow continued
for a good part of Monday morning.
Old Boreas has acquired the habit
of making unexpected visits in these
parts, one time sneaking up on us in
ihe stillness of the night, and the
lext time just falling in on us "ker
tlunk" with a dull thud. His next
visit is the cause of much specula
tion, and the people will not be sur
prised at any manner in which he
may make his appearance, nor at
any time.
The keeper of the editorial con
science, however, has . dropped a
nickel in the kiosk, and after gazing
into the crystal for some two hours
announces that the people may pre
pare for the worst, for it seems from
all prognostications and the Lady's
Birthday Almanac that it is yet to
come.
Watermelon Defies
Winter's Chilly Air
Looks As Good Today As It Did In
the Middle of the Summer
Season.
A nice, green, juicy looking water
melon, enough to make any little
pickaninny's mouth water and a
smile spread from ear to ear, was
rolled into the Parisian office Mon
day out of the cold and snow.
It wasn't exactly "rolled" in, ei
ther, for, in fact, Dudley Olive, of
Cottage Grove, brought it to town
in his buggy, along with some back
bones, spareribe, and such other
pai la of a hog's anatomy that would
tickle the palate of a king.
The watermelon was grown by Mr.
Olive last season, and when it rip
ened he pulled it from the vine and
carried it to his home with the in
tention of eating it within a day or
two. It was allowed to remain for
some time, however, when he decid
ed to see how long it would keep.
It looks as sound and fresh as ever,
and its outside appearance suggests
the good old summer time. The mel
on weighs 35 pounds.
aa a financial proposition that he
wanted to show his appreciation by
dining the sales force in honor of
the manager.
James R. Thomason, Jr., and Sam
uel Himelhoch both spoke in a com
plimentary manner of the benefit
they had derived m a business way
from being associated in these sales
with Mr. Bruce, and the latter feel
ingly responded to the tributes paid
him, thanking Mr. Himelhoch for the
compliment implied by the dinner
and assuring him that the kindly
feelings he expressed were duly re
ciprocated. The salespeople came in for a lib
eral share of commendation, ajid
then the business ef eating was tak
en up in earnest, and from all our
reporter could learn it certainly
must have been an enjoyable feast
Durins; Past Year More Than $350,
OOO Worth Are Shipped From
This Point.
GRAND TOTAL OF YEAR'S
LABORS REACHES $2,570,000
Includes All Products From Henry
County Farms, And Estimate
Based On Facts.
The livestock industry .of Henry
county is growing year by yeart and
within a very short while gives prom-"
ise of becoming one of the chief in
dustries of this section. " Through
the efforts of the railroads, live stock
associations and other interested par
ties the breeding of registered cattle
has become of far more importance
to some than ever before.
During the year just coming to a
close there has ' been shipped from
Paris more than $350,000 worth of
livestock, including horses, mules,
cattle, hogs, sheep, etc. They were
practically all shipped to the north
ern markets, though a great number '
of the horses and mules were pur
chased for war purposes and sent to
Europe.
The total receipts for the farm pro
ducts of Henry county during the
closing year total the magnificent
sum of $2,570,000. This is based on
careful estimates obtained from lo
cal handlers and dealers in each of
the products mentioned, and is very
nearly correct. The tobacco crop
heads the list, being estimated at a
million dollars, with cotton runing
second at a half million. Next
comes the produce, then the live
stock (cattle, hogs, sheep, etc.,)
then mules and horses. then the conr
crop, which is larger this year than
before; wheat follows in the foot
steps of the corn, then comes clover
seed, grain, etc.
The estimates on each of the pro
ducts, separately, as prepared for us
are:
Tobacco $1,000,000
Cotton 500,000
Produce (shipped) .. 300,000
Livestock ... 200,000
Mules and Horses . 150,000
