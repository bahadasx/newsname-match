and Washington; In the late spring the game Is popular In Philadelphia and
adjacent suburban clubs and Lakewood, N. J., and Is next followed by the
Western and mid-Western circuits. In May nnd June the game Is In full
swing at all the Kastern clubs and Narragansett Pier, It. I., nnnunlly wit
nesses the championship series extending over a period of several weeks. In
the recent tourney decided there the mounts used represented a cost of from

COOMBS WELL-GUARDED
WHILE ON BALL FIELD
Every time Jack Coombs,
pitcher of the Brooklyn (Nation
al league) champions, goes out on
the field to pitch he wears a
heavy rubber brace from knee to
hip, nnd supplements this with
yards and yards of bandages.
Jack also carries a heavy steel
brace as a protective device.
They are necessary, following
his severe Illness which ended
his career with the Athletics.
His wonderful stamina Is shown
by his ability again to hold his
end up as a pitcher with the
champions of 1916. Coombs
alono beat the Red Sox In the
recent series und has never been
defeated In a world's series.
CLABBY RETAINS COOL HEAD
Laughs at Warning of Newspaper Men
That George Chip Had a Punch
Kids With Scribes.
Jimmy Clabby is a fine example of
the boxer who keeps cool at all times.
Jimmy was boxing 20 rounds with
George Chip at Daly City. He had
been warned that If Chip ever 'con
nected with his chin he would be
"knocked dead."
Along about the tenth round, while
sitting In his corner, Clabby leaned

"Say," he said, "I thought you fel
lows said this guy had a punch."
"Better be careful, Jim," cautioned
one of the scribes, "If be lands you'll
find out."
Clabby threw back his head and
laughed. Then he came back with this:
"If a guy has a punch and can't land
It he husn't got It, has he?"
The newspaper men hud no Immedi

their goat. And throughout the re

BEST AGE FOR TENNIS
MAN PLAY8 AT TOPNOTCH WHEN

Champion Williams Says McLoughlln
wot Tnrouah Because Ha Is Twenty-Six
Years of Age Will
Keep on Playing.
"How long can a man play topnotch
tennis?"
R. Norrls Williams, II, gave vent to
a modest chuckle before answering this
query put to mm shortly after he had
aeteated William Johnston. California
In the national lawn tennis champion
ship finals at Forest Hills, N. Y.
"Why, I should say until he Is thirty
four or thirty-five. Do you think 'Mor-
rie McLoughlln Is entirely broken slm
ply becaus ho is twenty-six?" the
:namplon asked in reply. Not a bit
3f it. It is .entirely probable, and I
shouldn't In the least be surprised to
see him come back to the best he ever
played within the next six years and
regain the title.
"I have no expectations, but only
hopes, as to the length of time I can
remain chamiion or a championship
contender. I am twenty-four now,
R. Norrls Williams, II.
And a man ought to play the very best
tennis of his career around twenty-nine
or thirty, for the reason that at that
age he is likely to have retained his
stamina and to have played long
enough to have acquired the experience
which Is so valuable In big matches.
Look at Karl Behr. He is far from
broken.
"There may be this, however, to be
sold about McLoughlln. It Is highly
possible that his smashing style takes
the physical strength out of a man In
nis younger years, where the game
which either William Johnston or I
rlay would conserve It. It Is not lm
"osslbie that a vital difference lies
!here.
"I expect to keep up with my tennis
ivhile In business as much as I did
while at Harvard, where I was gradu
ated last June."
TRAP SHOOTING IS POPULAR
With Very Few Exceptions Every
State In Union Participated in
Grand American.
With the exception of New Mexico,
New Hampshire, Maine and Virginia,
trap shooters from every state In the
Union, and Canada too, participated
In the recent grand American trap
shooting tournament at St. Louis.
There can be no question about the
popularity of a sport that will attract
C83 entrants from 44 states, the Dis
trict ef Columbia apd Canada. Of
this number Illinois supplied the great
est number, 225; Missouri was next
with not quit half as many as Illi
nois, 112. Of Illinois' total, Chicago
supplied 44, more than any other city
in the country.
The best representation of any city
In the country, however, was made by
Hillsboro. 111. This town of 7,000 pop
ulation has a gun club of 40 members
nnd of this number ten shot In the big

not always supply the greatest num

as the grand American. Pennsylvania,
for instance, contributed but six en
trants, while Iowa had 41 ; Indiann had
45, Ohio hod 30, Kansas had 21, Okla
homa 19, Wisconsin and Tennessee 17

before the British air service experts
discovered that the airship brought

What Inspired admiration and won

the wreck was the Incredible delicacy
of the workmunslilp that created some
thing larger thun the Lusitunla to float
n the air, und which against the tens
of thousunds of tons weight of the
Lusitunla, with engines, guns, bombs
and all, the super-Zeppelin Is figured
as weighing only 50 tons. The whole
aluminum and wire structure weighed
only, the experts report, nine tons. .

"The externals of the airship, her
outer fubrles and gns bags, were de
