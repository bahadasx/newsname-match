EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER
h UMBER S!
A Close Call
We didn't even get the bird's
tail feather scorched, but believe
us, on first sight it looked as if
there was going to be a lot of
people without this grand old
rag of freedom this week. And v
looked more like the editor and
the whole force, even "Ink" tht
cat, was going to be minus tht'
old print shop that we have been
building up for the past eight
years. The fire bell sounded at
1:20 yesterday afternoon and
from where we stood at the time
we calculated "the Eagle office,
she's afire". In about three
flops of a jack rabbits tail we
were at the office and found that
the center of fire, smoke and ex
citement was one door east, in
Ben Clark's bath house. Water
was going through the hose and
playing on the fire within a few
minutes and then owing to the
nature of the blaze and its loca
tion, the fire boys had to "hop
the cut" on Ben and give the
place a bath. In just one nourri
time, the boys had the blaze out
and the apparatus returned to its
place. The fire was caused from
the explosion of a lamp that was
being filled by Linvil Nehrbas.
who was looking after the place
during the absence of Mr. Clark
who had gone to Baker in the
morning. The young fellow was
pretty badly burned but he did
not give in until he had ran to
the bell tower and gave the alarm
first. But for the prompt res
ponse and hard work of the fire
boys we would have had a ser
ious fire, and we for one, certain
ly appreciated the good work that
was done. May the next fire,
if it must come, luave us without
the effects we experienced yes
terday—a good imitation of back
fever.
J. D. Williams was in town to
day from Sykes.

Mable Fay Pierce
Mable Fay Pierce passed away
at her home, at the foot of New
bary Hill on Saturday, November
16th, 1916, death resulting very
unexpectly after only a few
hours illness. She was born in
Atchinson county, Mo. on Sept.
17, 1893, having attained the
age of 23 years, 2 months and 29
days. In March, 1913 she was
united in marriage to Marion F.
Pierce, to which union, three
sons were born. Besides them
she leaves a father, mother and
twelve sisters and brothers. In
1915, she came to this section to
aid in acquiring a new home.
The funeral services were v held
from the Church at Ekalaka on
Wednesday and the remains laid
to rest in the I. 0. 0. F. ceme
tery.
Advertise
Now that the country is so
prosperous and the farmer seems
head the list, it might be well for
the merchants to study over the
question of advertising in the
local paper, Never at any other
time was there such an effort
being put forth by the big houses
to gather in the farmers dollars
and secure his trade. And what
are you, Mr. Local Merchant
going to do about it? You know
you are entitled to the qig end of
the trade from these farmers.
The way to get it is do like these
biir fellows—advertise. Would
it not be more convenient for the
farmer to set by his fireside on
these cold nights and read what
have to say than to make a trip
into town every other day to set
if you have certain goods. Keep
him posted each week on new
goods that are arriving and you
will get his trade. A trip to
town, only to find that certain ar
ticles or goods have not arrived,
boosts the big fellow's game.
