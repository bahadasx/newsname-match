VOLUME XXIX
CHARGE CONTRACTOR
LEE WITH PERJURY
Prosecuting Attorney Tuesday Piled
Informal ion Direct in Superior
Court Against Contractor
——-
Tuesday morning Prosecuting At
torney R. M. Burgunder filed an in- |
formation in (lie superior court
charging K. L. Lee, the road con
tractor, with perjury in the second
degree. The Information alleges
that on the sth day of September of
this year Lee filed a payroll with the
county commissioners purporting to
cover certain work performed on per
manent highway No. 2, and that on
the same day the defendant, as su
perintendent and person in charge of
the work, knowingly and unlawfully
before Geo. 11. Newman, deputy au
ditor and clerk of the commissioners
court, swore falsely and in writing
that the services in the payrolls
were performed and were true and
correct.
The Information Further alleges
that in truth and fact the payroll
was false and was known to be false
by the defendant in the following
particulars: First, that R. H. Thomas
and K. S. Fucheinin did not work
on permanent highway No. 2 during
the time mentioned nor at all; sec
ond, /that Alfred Lyons and team did
not work over 12 hours on the said
road; that L. M. Lyons and team did
not work over to hours on the road;
fourth, that none of the men or
teams worked on August 20, or from
August 26 to 31 inclusive; fifth, that
the total amount due the men does
not exceed 1450, and that the de
fendant's commission did not exceed
$90.
According to the pay roll, a copy
of which was attached to the in
formation, 15 men were employed
on this particular piece of road from
August' 17 to .11, inclusive, and the
total amount alleged to have been
expended on the road was $sin. On
this amount Lee claimed as his com
mission the sum of $162, represent
ing 20 per cent. As between the pay
roll and the charges contained in the
Information filed by Prosecuting At
torney Burgunder, there is a dis
crepancy of $360 in the cost of the
work and $72 In the amount repre
sent ing Lee's commission.
Monday afternoon Prosecuting At
torney Burgunder presented the facts
contained in the Information to the
board of county commissioners and
the latter unanimously agreed to co
operate with him and directed him
to push the criminal charge against
Lee. This was the first concrete evi
dence pointing toward irregularities
on the part of the contractor In the
fulfillment of his contract which had
been presented to the commissioners,
and they are determined to carry the
matter to a definite conclusion.
The case was originally started
against Lee In the justice court, when
he was charged with grand larceny,
the specific charge being that Lee
had padded the pay roll for the work
done on permanent highway No. 8,
near Pullman. At that time he was
released on $5000 bonds, furnished
by two Colfax business men, to ap
pear at a later date to enter hi! plea.
The date of the hearing was post
poned twice, and in order to get the
matter before the superior court in
time for next jury term, Prosecuting
Attorney Burgunder decided to file
direct in the higher court.
A bond in the sum of $5000 has
been required of Lee under the new
charge, the bondsmen in the former
action having been released.
The preliminary hearing was held
Wednesday, when Lee filed a de
murrer to the complaint, alleging
that the facts contained therein
were not sufficient to constitute a
crime. Judge R. L. McCroskey fixed
December 29 as the date for hearing
on the demurrer.

FOR PULLMAN WREN
i
i
Committee Recommends That Sev
eral Streets Be Closed to Traffic
Billing' Certain Boms
At the meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce Tuesday the matter of
providing safe places for coasting
was brought up by the Rev. .1. \V.
Caughlan, lie asserted that under
existing conditions fatal accidents
are almost a certainty and urged that
certain streets be set aside for coast
ing and closed to other traffic. A
warm discussion followed, several
taking the position that it the city
should designate certain streets for
roasting it would he liable for dam
aces for any accidents occurring on
such streets. Mr. Caughlan retorted
that it would be far better for the
city to pay such damages than for
one or more children to be killed on
account of the Indifference of the
men and women of the city.
President Allen appointed .1. N.
Emerson, W. C. Kruegel and Rev.
J. W. Caughlan as a committee to

10:00 p. in. for coasting for adults.
That ropes be stretched and the

trolled during coasting hours. That

of commerce luncheon Tuesday again
brought up (he matter in a forceful
speech. lie called attention to sec
lion 20 of the law governing perman
ent highways, which he contended
would apply to the proposed road,
and insisted that [he committee in
charge of the matter should take It
up with the county commissioners
without further delay. The am
pa ign for this much needed improve
ment has dragged because the city
was not in a position to stand the ex
pense entailed in securing the right
or was, but this problem can appar
ently be solved by the application
of the law cited by Mr. Klemgard,
which reads as follow!:
Sec. 20, Each and every county of

NUMBER
BOARD SAYS "NO"
ON ELECTION CLAIMS
Commissioners lleluse to Allow Full
Amount or election mil-.— Dim.
grunt led Officials May Go to
Court to Collect
The courts In all probability will
tie called upon to decide whether or
not the county commissioners were
justified 111 trimming the claims of
numerous election official! for serv
ices rendered at the recent general
election. Tbe commissioners at
tempted to arrive at an equitable
standard upon which to gauge the
pa) of the election officials, figuring
a certain number of votes counted as
a day's work. This system resulted
in cutting down quite materially a
large number of claims for service
on election boards, and with the re
ceipt by the official! of the warrants
In the reduced amounts protests were
hurled at the county beads from
every direction The protests, both
written and oral, failed to shake the
confidence of the commissioners iv
the ".system" employed in fixing the
amounts due each official, and they
steadfastly refused to allow the full
amount of the claims presented.
.1. W. Mathews, mayor elect of
Pullman, appeared before the board
Monday morning and returned the
warrant Issued to his wife, which
included pay for more than a day
less than the time put In by her. Mr.
Mathews .-aid he did not doubt that
the commissioners were acting in
good faith, but declined to agree
with them that an equitable stand
ard could be set as a basis for deter
mining the amounts due each elec
tion hoard according to the number
of votes counted. "I do not say this
as a threat or a bluff." stated Mr.
Mathews, "but unless the board sees
fit to allow the full amount of this
claim. I am prepared to take steps
looking toward a collection of the
full amount. It is not the amount of
money involved, but simply a matter
of principle My wife resents the
implication that she 'loafed on the
Job,' and asked for more than she
earned."
A large number of similar claims
hlngs upon the result of the Math
ews claim, and the case is being
watched with interest.
FEDERATED CHURCH
MAY ERECT IU!IDI.\<3
The Inadequacy of the present
quarters occupied by the Federated
church ban forced the organisation
to seek other quarters and plans aie
now on foot for the construction of a
commodious and well appointed
building at the corner of Ruby and
Montgomery streets, on the 80x100
feel lot recently purchased from A.
I). Wexler, Six thousand dollars has
already been subscribed toward the
building fund and it is thought that
no difficulty will be encountred in
raising a sum sufficient to cover th"
cost of a new structure.
The lot on which it is propose 1 to
erect the church building is admir
ably located for such a purpose, be
ing almi i the exact center of popu
lation of the city. The church heads
mlii, for a building that can tie used
for a community social center, to be
open at all times for the use of the
membership and others.
A COMMUNITY CHRISTMAS
Although the plan of holding a
community Christmas tree in Pull

with that end in view have arranged
to go about the town on Christmas
eve singing the old carols. All citi
zens are urged to co-operate by plac
ing caudles In their windows and
helping to Illuminate the town, so
that all may feel that they are shar
ing in the Christmas spirit.
