' The boya at Camp Darning are feel
ing good thia moming because of a
little Cbristmaa remembrance from
the government they represent. Each
enlisted man waa presented with a
nice little Christinas package con

One rasor,
One ahaving brash,
One tooth brush,
One shoe brash,
One eomb,
Box of shoe polish,
Two towels.
, One cake soap,
One whisk broom,
One housewife containing a lot of
nsefnl articles for boys in oamp.
It ia unnecessary to state that the

Ti Caxp C axing
Camp Deming was honored this
-week by the presence of two dis-
tinanishel military men from Wash
ington, Brigadier General Smith and
Colonel Horry P, Birmingham, Act
ing Burgeon General of the United
States. General Smith inspected the
camp in a very thorough manner, the
hospitals being carfsl!y inspected by
Colonel Birmingham.
Although the gentlemen were not
permitted to make any regular report,
it ia very easy to understand that
they were thoroughly pleased with
Cnmp Deming in mny ways, both as
to its location and sanitary condi
tion. Both of these distinguished sol
diers are most personal friends of
Colonel Glenn, with whom they have
labored in military affairs fur many
years. '
Colonel BirtninEham was giad to
note that the healthiness of the camp
was in splealld condition. Of the
three thousand or more men there
were only about a bare three doien
an fit for military duty.
