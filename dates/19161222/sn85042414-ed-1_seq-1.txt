FOR SOME TIME
English Have Made Elabo
rate Preparations to
Protect Canal.
While winter weather is causing
military' operations on the most of the
fronting fight to lack features of in
terest, considerable activity Is devel
oping in sectors far enough south to
admit of energetic campaigning.
On the Tigris, the British, after ai
long period of quiet, have pushed for
ward close to Kut-El-Mara on the
south and are continuing to attack
the Turkish forces In that region, evi
dently In the hope of resuming their
long delayed march toward Bagdad.
Now, another Held of activity Is de
manding attention with today's an
nouncement from London that British
forces have captured El Arish, In
Egypt, on the Mediterranean, 0 miles
east of the 'Suez canal.
To Protect Canal.
Little has been heard from the
Egyptian operations for some time,
but the British are known to have
been making somewhat elaborate
preparations to protect the canal re
gion from further incursions such as
that of last summer and their de
fensive lines have been pushed far
out on the Sinai peninsula. Appar
ently there has been a recent effort
still, further to extend the defensive
sone, of which the capture of El Arish
constitutes an important develop
ment.
The taking of El Arish establishes
the British front at this point well
toward the border of Palestine and
marks the furthest eastward penetra
tion by British forces in this area
since the Turkish raids began.
El Arish has been the object pre
viously of attacks by British aviators
and warships and last May a com
bined naval and air raid "on the place
waa reported to have destroyed the
fortifications.

London, Dec. 23.—Parliament was

members being given any further In­1
formation regarding President Wll

ment contemplated with respect to it.
Neither the note nor the German
peaoe proposal was mentioned in the
king's speech, read in both houses.
The speech from the throne was one
of the briefest on record. It expressed
confidence in the ultimate victory of
the allies and determination to prose
cute the war, "until we have vindi

London, Dec. 22.—Referring to
President Wilson's note, Hie Ev

"Any communication from the
head of a great and friendly
power Is assured of courteous and
respectful consideration, and It
would be only misleading the
president to leave the Impression
that any move on his part toward
peace at this time of the war
would be welcome by Great Bri
tain or her allies. It is singular,
indeed, that statesmen of Mr.
Wilson's perspicuity can. labor

regular life of the soldiers has stead

Among the most Interesting experi

board, which Is conducting the work,
has evolved a unique line of targets,
worked by ropes and pulleys, which
fall flat when the cavalry charge over
them. The attempt Is being made to
evolve a system of pistol firing while
charging. At present the men are
firing directly ahead while leaning for

their arms just ahead of the right of
their mounts' ears. Excellent results,
it is said, have already been obtained.
When ammunition arrives, another
interesting test will be made, that of
determining how effectually the pres
ent three-inch field gun will demolish
barbed wire entanglements, trenches
and bomb proofs. A line of fortifica

like those In Europe as possible. The
artillery will be allowed to work on

Edlnburg, Bee. 23.—President
Wilson is declared to have placed
himself in a position of an Inter

The Scotsman, which In an edl'
torial commenting on the presi
dent's note says:
"President Wilson has hither

can have prompted him to throw
aside that peculiarly prudent re

SOLDIER MEMBER
URGES ENGLAND
Says Country Ought to hear
German Terms—A. Bonar
Law Rebukes Him.
London, Dec. 22.—There was fur
ther discussion of Germany's peace
offer in the House of Commons last
night.
Sir John A. Simon on behalf of
himself and a group of followers gave
unqualified support to Premier Lloyd
George's speech in the House of Com
mons, and then Hastings B. L. Smith,
Liberal member for Northampton
dressed in his military uniform,,
sounded a new note—urging that the
German proposals. be allowed to see
the light of day.
Andrew Bonar Law, chancellor of
the exchequer and members of the
war council promptly rose In behalf
of the government and declared that
}f the tone of Mr Smith's speech per
meate) the country then all tfye .blood'
and tretsUfe whtifh hadbeen spent
In the war would have treen spent In
y»in.
"My understanding."-said Mr. Smith
in his address, "Is that'the reply of
the premier to the German note was
to the effect that the door was not
yet closed- That is a wise answer,
and the best possible answer at this
stage. The German proposals should
be allowed to see the light of day. If
they disclose an aggressive purpose,
then the German people will realize
that they are not'suffering and dying
for their mere existence as they have
been told.
"If it were put to a vote of the
men at the front whether—provided
we could obtain guarantees that our
honorable obligations would be ful
filled—we should then make a seri
ous effort to get the parties together
then I am certain such a proposition
would be carried by virtual unanimi
ty.
"I am not prepared to face the
prospects of a military decision which
means a war of attrition unless I am
convinced there is no other way out
I believe in 'the security scheme by
which the nations agree together each
to .guarantee all and all guarantee
each. An attempt to hold the cen
tral empires down by a military de
cision, followed by economic strangu
lation would mean carrying forward
into peace all hostilities and hatreds
of.'the War: It would divide Europe
into two hostile camps and would
make war more inevitable and deadly
than ever and would fasten conscrip
tion and militarism forever on all na
tions."

Bismarck, X. D.t Dec- 22.—The pro
posed terminal elevator and the state
owned packing plant should be locat
ed on the Missouri river, at the BU'
marck and Mandan side, respectively,
in the opinion of John Bloodgood of
New Salem, who says:
"The terminal elevator recently
dedicated by the Society of Equity will
be a great help to the city of St. Paul
and state of Minnesota. But it Is not
fair for North Dakota producers to
go in with the money they make from
North Dakota farms and build up St.
Paul and -Minnesota. Rather, they
should build -up North Dakota and
our own cities...
"I have lived in Morton county 33
years. I am 68 years old and I ami
not looking for anything for myself,
But for the good of the. state of which
I think so much, I ask. 'Why not
build terminal elevators and state
packing plants here in our own
state?' Surely no ,fctate has a better
right- to auch plants. This state has
everything within hpr own boundaries
to justify the building of such enter
prises. And a start should be made
this winter.-
Question of a Site.
"An important question is that of a
proper site. I will suggest as the
logical location for a state terminal
elevator tlje Missouri river landing
on the Bismarck side, and for a state
packing plant-the Missouri river land
ing on the Mandan side. First, be
cause these locations are nearly in the
center of the state second, because
the selection of the sites named would
place these Important enterprises
upon one of the greatest rivers in the
world, a stream which soon must be
come one of the northwest's greatest
arteries of commerce- This will mean
an opportunity for the producers of
all the northwest to ship their grain,
livestock, dressed meats, every prod
uct of-the farm, from Mandan and
Bismarck by an all-water route to
Europe, via New Orleans, with but
one transfer. Think of. this saving in
transportation and of all the middle
men's profits which would be elim
inated! And then consider the hun
dreds of cities this route would bring
us as a market for our produce.
North Dakota railroads would be
compelled to meet river competition if
the plants were located here, and we
coujd do away with our railroad com
missioners—the river would be the
best regulator of rates.
River Route Feasible.
"Friends of the railroads will tell
you that the river route will never
work that river transportation has
been going backward for the last fifty
years, and this is all true. But they
may not tell you the real cause, which
is that the legislatures of every state
in the Union except New York have
assisted the railroads in killing the
canals and river transportation. But
now the or^er of things haa changed,
and people are comitg once more in
to their own.
"If our government in the last fifty
years had stood by ita rivers and built
canals instead of. spending millions In
fighting the railroad sand pleaalng po
lltlcal pork seekers dumping mil
lions into worthless reeka, we would
now be in a position where tnuispor*
tatlon tariffs would cdjust themselves
without any tinkering Upon the part
of the interstate coniqerce commis
sion or local boards. And I trust that
as a means of advancing the develop
ment of Qur great river and of fur
thering the progress of the entire
state, our new administration will
work for enterprises within the state
of North Dakota to :he complete ex
clusion of anything outside the state."

HIS PROPAGANDA
IS REFERRED TO
War News Relegated to Mi
nor Position in all Lon
don Papers.
Iondon,
Dec. 22.—President Wil­
son's note is given the honor of the
biggest display in the morning papers
relegating war news to a minor place.
Head lines such as "President Wil
son's Strange Peace Essay," "Presi
dent Wilson's Peace Feeler," "Amaz
ing Note," Indicate in slight measure
the astonishment caused' by the com
munication. Much speculation is In
dulged in as to the motives or the
causes which inspired the president to
send such a note after his assumption
of the attitude that he would not
mediate unless invited by both groups
of belligerents.
One section of the press, utterly re
jecting any Idea of the possibility of
peace negotiations as the outcome of
the recent German note, attributes
the president's action to the success
of propaganda conducted by Count
.von Bernstorff in America and what
they described as the masterly inac
tivity of the late British government.
The more general impression Is
that the agitation in America for an
embargo on food products had much
to do with Mr. Wilson's action. It Is
also suggested that the president may
have received special information
from the German government and Is
aware of the extent to which Ger
many is prepared to go toward "rep
aration, restitution and guarantees."
This is the view expressed by. The
Daily Chronical. Some diacusslon Is
also devoted to the chances of con
gress passing food export measures,
and popslblx an eipbargo .-an fatten
and war materials.
First News This Morning.
The general public had their first
news of President Wilson's note
from the morning papers and the
matter was the one topic of conversa
tion on in-coming suburb trains and
throughout the country. The people,
like the press, were rather taken
aback as they had about arrived at
the conclusion that Premier Lloyd
George's speech had put an end to all
peace talk unless the central powers,
in their reply to the premier, were
prepared to define their terms. That
the president or any other neutral
ruler-would take any action was far
thest-from their mind.
The evening papers which do not
print .'editorials came out with big
head lines which expressed their
views. The Evening News, which is
the afternoon edition of The Dally
Mail, heads a reprint of the comment
of the morning papers with one word
"No" in large black type.

INDICATIONS Of STffS

to Become Clearing House
For Peace Views.
EXPECT FRIENDLY
RECEPTION NOTE
Entente Ambassadors May
Advise Countries to so
Receive It.
Washington—With the purpose of
President Wilson's note to belliger
ents clarified by official statements on
the subject, the attention of the Uni
ted States has turned to the reception
of the note in the foreign capitals.
Diplomats here are eagerly watch
ing for indications of whether the
European neutrals will follow the lead
of the United States and make a
similar appeal to the warring powers.
There is growing feeling that the
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for views, and possi
bly for terms of the belligerents. Bev
eral of the diplomats have advised
their governments to that effect in
order to guide them in their replies.
Surprise at the fast growing signi
ficance of the president's move was
expressed on all sides, where it was
pointed out that at first the opinion
prevailed that the note itself
waa
merely a "feeler" and that the most
immediately contemplated effect in
issuing it was the receipt of some
sort of deination from the various
warring nations that the president
should let it be known. Indirectly to
the diplomats for their guidance, that
he went even further than that and
counted on an absolutely frank reply
from the belligerents w££ph should
lead to an actual opportunity for
negotiations proved only less surpris
ing than the actual note itself.
Indications that entente diplomats
would advise their government to re
ply to the president's note in a friend
ly spirit proved a source of gratifica
tion today, as it was pointed-both In-'
the ndte itself and in Secretary Lan
sing's explanation, that one' of the
dangers was that the alli*a would con.
sider the step as a pro-Gsrman move.
Every effort was made to remove this
Impression.
