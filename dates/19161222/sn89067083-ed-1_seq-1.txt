New fork A land battleship, with
wheels 200 feet high, driven by engines
of many thousand horse power, able to
cross the Hudson as if it were a mad
puddle Sod during the British tanks
as a locomotive does a hand car, Is
the prediction of Frank Bhutnan, the
PhlladulpfrU inventor, whose concrete
piling and wire classes, says the New
York Times, made him famous. Mr.
Shuman believes that the neat War will
Bring a, Juggernaut that could mow
through, in army as easily as through
field of wheat Its giant wheels
would have to turn over Just 13 times
to cover a mile; its giant size would
send it ever rivers and valleys as eas
ily as an automobile takes a foot-wide
deatresston in the road. , -.
Mr. buman says there is nothing
technically impossible about such a
machine; , which would, mean to land
battles 'what the superdreadnaught
means to war .upon the seas. . Guns
would be the smallest part of the de
stroying power of such a monster,
which, by sheet force would sweep
away almost any obstacle the enemy
could oppose. ' In the December is
sue of the Popular Science Monthly,
Of what he believe such aa Instru
ment of war would be.
"A club, a bow and arrow, a blun
derbuss, an. infantryman's rifle, a .42
eentlmetcr howIUer are-mercly instru
ments for delivering blows," he soys.
"The essential difference between bat
tles of prehistoric times and those of
today lie in the manner of delivering
blows.' Smokeless powder has merely
lengthened the arm of tho fighter. Be
strikes and kills at a distance of miles.
"Because armies are still composed
essentially of many individuals fight
ing ships may be more fittingly termed
war machines,' A battleship is a real
machine. The men on board are mere
ly so many Intelligences that control
the steam engine, the turrets, the great
guns, and searchlights. But land war
far 1 still waged, not by a few ma
chines, as on the sea, but by organized
millions ot men.
"Why is there no land battleship,
something comparable with our own
-Pennsylvania, something which Will
concentrate within one volume the
striking power of en army?
Engineering Possibility.
"There is no good engineering rea
son why an enormous wheeled struc
ture heavily armored, and capable of
traveling at high speed, should not
wage the battles of the future. Tech
nically it is a far easier task to de
sign and build, a superdreadnaught
than a wheeled destroyer to run on
solid ground. The ocean Is a vast
level expanse. There are no hill and
valleys. Waste Is in the same den
sity everywhere. But land varies from
the hardest rock to the softest quag.
mire. Here we have the reason, why
we still oppose armies., against each
other instead of machines. . -'
"Undeniable as these difficulties are,
it seems to me that they could be over
come by boldly designing a machine
of such dimensions and of such en
ergy that It could travel over a country
road. A hill 00 feet -high would be to
that machine what a six-inch ridge of
day would be to an automobile; a
swamp would no more binder its course
than a half a foot of mud would stop
touring car. Bven over rough inland
conatry.it would rush inure swiftly
than any touring ear on a poor road.
The impact of a heavy mass moving
with the velocity of as express train
would be Irresistible. ' Indeed, In its
speed would lie its destructive pos
sibilities. , It could mdw down every
thing before It With the relenUesxnes
of a steam roller. Guns would not be
required to -rout aa enemy. An army
would be as helpless la offering resist
ance as a flock of geese in the path of
an automobile. - ' . '
"Picture to yourself a self-propelled
machine, comprising three wheels and
a heavily-armored body or car. .There
are two wheels, 150 to 200 feet I3 U
amoter, in front and a single erunllcr
steering wheel to the rear. , The en
tire structure Is short so that the turn
ing rudlus will be small. .
"No doubt you are familiar with the
military ninata of our American hat-
tleshlD. They are iutticel towers not
unlike cages. Tuey are thus construct
ed so that the whole sections of the
lattice work may be shot away; but
the remaining portions will still sup
port the mast. ,--
"So I would build the wheels of my
war machine. - Why not armor them
instead? They would weigh too much
thousands of tons. But the hub I
would armor, and heavily. There the
spokes would be concentrated so
thickly that they might be shot away
in great numbers and the wheel still
stand.
"The two front wheels of this war
machine would nave to be spaced
about 200. feet apart1! They would
have a tread about 20 feet wide.; I
would make them of steel in plates
four inches thick, bolted together in
sections." ... ., v - .. ?
Car Comparatively Small.
"Since the machine Is to destroy by
virtue of its inherent energy, aud not
by means of guns, it would have a
comparatively small car car which J
would not rise above the tops of the
front wheels, which would be heavily
armored and which would serve pri
marily as 'a housing for the engines.
The crew would be. small nq more
than perhaps thirty men.
"I am fully aware that the problem
of obtaining engines which will give
this war machine a speed of 100 miles
an hour is pot easily solved. But if
thousands of horse power con be devel
oped by the engines of pitching and
rolling battleships, It is not unreason
ably to suppose that competent en
gineers could bo found to design and
build steam engines of 20,000' horse
power fed by oil-Bred boilers. -!
"The weight of the entire structure
would be probably 6,000 tons. Since
the machine is to batter down every
thing In its path, there would be sus
pended from the front of the. machine
8. series of heavy weights, each weigh
ing several tons. Their impact at high

"Terrible as this contrivance would
be it would not be able to withstand
bombardment by 10-luch Bodkn - or
Krupp guns. It Is Lot Intended for
that Ordinary field artillery would
not stop it. Its Sole purpose is to
, '1 -- 1 ;
to make a veldt region untenable,' to
crush down resistance offered by or
dinary field fortifications.
Imagine yourself standing at one
front wheel of this machine. Compar
atively you would be no bigger than
baby standing beside the driving
whuel of a pnsseRgor locomotive. Far
above you would be the mate of spokes
constituting the latticed wheel.
Perched midway between the two gi
gantic wheels ss tall as an office build
ing would be the ship-shaped armor car
for the engines and crew. You reach
it by means of sn elevator. With the
commander you step into the conning
tower a circular armored chamber
well forward, dominating the entire
landscape. ' " -!
'The commander gives a signal. The
machine moves. It gains headway.
Boon It travels at express train speed.
