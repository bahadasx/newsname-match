PEACE A BOON,
SAYS SCHWAB
Arrival Will Add to U. S.
Prosperity, Asserts
Steel Man
Chsrles M. Schwab, chairman of the
board of directors of the Rethlehem
Steel Company, laut night gave the an?
swer, at least bo far a? the steel in?
dustry ?a concerned, to the all-absorb?
ing question: "What will happen when
peace is declared?"
Mr. Schwab'? answer was entirely op?
timistic.
"Some f.ce disaster if peace comes,"
he paid, "but 1 look upon peace as a
blessing, and I should rejoice in it if it
came. Hut we all want h eonclasivs
peace, and not a peace which merely
presaga? another war."
Ill Behwah was ?peaking ?? the
guest of honor at the Lotos Club. Ha
declared that in his firm judgment th?
profits of peace would tur outweigh
the profits of war. As proof of hi?
faith that the output of rails, ship
building materials and structural steel
would exceed by enormous quantities
the prescrit output of nnnor. ordnance
and munition?, lie pointed to the $1110,
000,000 building nnd construction pro?
gramme which the Hethlehem Steel
( ompany plans for the next few years
A slight drop in prices might follow
the declaration of peace, he said, bu*
no aesjte depression, in his opinion,
could be looked for until more than
three yearn ahead.
Plea for Merchant Service
Tie made a plea for a merchan*
marine, lower tolls for American ?hip?
in the Panama (anal, for greater In
dustruil eoheaiveaees and prcparedno?.
and in a patriotic outburst offered 'he
use of the Hethlehem works to the
government to turn out materials "at
th??ir own price."
Mr. Schwab was introduced by Frank
R. Lawrence, president <?f the club,
as a "Held marshal of industry." who
had been "transmuting iron into gold
until it had become commonplace."
"Inder arise laws, if we can only
get them," he said, "American indus
try need not fear the competition of
Bay other people, and this will be more
emphatically tnie if we cease to be the
great, supine, helpless giant that we
ar<? to day, and place ourselves in a
position to command and. If need be.
compel the respect of mankind."
In praising Mr. Schwab. K. (.. Grace,
president of the Bethlehem Stool Com?
pany, for th?. Ant time nublicly con?
firmed the truthfulness o? the rumors
prevalent soon after the beginning of
the war to the effect that Herman in

President. H inyn:
I have learned from several quart ors that a wrong im?
pression was made by the statement which I made this
morning, and I wish to correct that impression.
My intention was to suggest the very direct and neces?
sary interest which this country, as one of the neutral na?
tions, has in the possible ti-rms which the ?belligerents may
have in ni'nd. and I did not intend to intimate that the
?government ?vas considering any change in its policy of
neutrality which it has ?consistently pursued in the face of
constantly increasing difficulties.
I regret that my words were open to any other con?
struction, as I now realize that they were. I think that
the whole tone and language of the note to the belligerents
show the purpose without further comment on my ?part. It
is needless to Bay that I am unreservedly in support of that
purpose and hope to see it accepted.
Iv kit earlier statement Mr. I.av.tiinj unid:
Tho .sending: of this not*? will indicate the possibility ?>f our he?
ir,g forced into the war. That possibility ought to serve as a restrain
tng and sobering fono safeguarding American ?rights. If may also
serve to force an earlier conclusion of the war. Neither the Presi?
dent nor myself regard this note as a peace note; it is m? rely an
effort to get the belligerents to define the end for which they are
fighting.
The reasons for the sending ?>f the note were BJ follow-.
It isn't our material interest we had in mind when the note ?vas
sent, but more and more our own rights are becoming involved by the
belligerents on both sides, so that the situation is becoming increas?
ingly critical.
I mean by that that we are ?hawing nearer the verge of war
ourselves, and therefore we are cntitk-tl to know exactly what each
belligerent seeks in order that we may regulate our conduct in tha
future.
So nation ha? been sounded. N'o consideration of the German
overtures or <>f the speech of l.loyd (ieorge was taken into account
in the formulation of the document. The only thing the overtures
did was to delay it a few day*. It was not decided to send it until
Monday. Of ?'ourse, the difficulties that face the President were
that it might be construed as a movement toward peace and in aid
of the German overtures. He -rpecitically denies that that was the
fact in the document itself.

TO ?GERMAN ENTHUSIASM
Diplomats Skeptical of Peace Outcome, but
Believe Belligerents Will Answer Wash?
ington Promptly?U-Boat Menace Is
Said to Have Influenced Wilson
Washington, Dec. 21.?Two .attempts were made to-day
by Robert Lansing, Secretary of State, to interpret the Presi?
dent's peace note sent on Monday to all the belligerents.
.Mr. Lansing's statements were contradictory. The second
was an apology for the first. Both resulted in adding confusion
to an already complicated situation.
The first statement by the Secretary was made shortly
before noon to-day to a group of Washington correspondents.
Mr. I*ansing was informed that people believed that the note
was designed to reinforce the German peace overtures. Dis?
claiming this, Mr. Lansing dictated a statement, in which he
made the assertion that the United State* had been ftat.M,Htaan? ?a
the verge of war and that unless peace came soon "there was
a possibility of our being forced into it.*'
The effect was electrical. There was consternation in
diplomatic circles. The stock market broke as soon as the
news of Mr. Lansing's statement got on the wires. President
Wilson promptly heard of it and sent a hurry ?all for the
Secretary of State to come at once to the White House.
Emerging from the conference with the President. Mr.
Lansing announced that he would have another statement
soon. He immediately began the preparation of this, and read
it to the correspondents at 3:4.5 o'clock. Mr. Lansing's atti?
tude showed deep chagrin.
SAYS WILSON FEARS CLASH IS NEAR
Mr. Lansing's morning statement entirely confirmed the
theory, printed in The Tribune this morning, as advanced by
the President's friends. That theory is that Mr. Wilson has
a live fear that the United States cannot much longer stave
off a clash with Germany. He knows that Germany has pre?
pared a new fleet of submarines, which will be read^v in a few
weeks, and he believes that th<* German threat of fright fulness
will be carried out unless the Allies accepted the Kaiser's
proffer of peace.
The effect of Mr. Lansing's second statement was to alter
materially the position of the United States in the peace situa?
tion. Mr. Wilson's note plainly insinuated that the United
States was projecting itself into the situation as a matter of
right, because its position as a neutral was becoming "in?
tolerable."
Mr. Lansing's first statement accented this, but the second
statement made it appear that President Wilson had merely
offered his services in a friendly way, to be accepted or re?
jected as each belligerent might deem fit, with no possibility
that the result could affect the present status of the United
States as a neutral. In fact, it was stated authoritatively by
a high Administration official, after Mr. Lansing's second
statement, that a supplementary note might be lent to make
it perfectly clear that the United States was not presuming
tu claim the right of mediation.
As a result of this new attitude, the feeling in Kntente
([iiarters improved decidedly. It is now felt that the Allies
will be free to answer the proposal of the German government
and the offer of President Wilson according to their own
interests, unprejudiced by the fear that an uncompromising
answer might alienate American sympathy.
RESENTMENT IN ENTENTE CIRCLES
As pointed out in The Tribune to-day, there was strong
resentment in Allied circles over the apparent fact that Mr.
Wilson had assumed the right to propose peace negotiations.
Kntente sympathizers pointed to the Civil War situation.
when President Lincoln denied that the neutrals had any such
right of interference, though their plight at that time was as
near to being "intolerable" as that of the United States i-,
to-day.
Hut now that Mr. Lansing, speak?
ing with the authority of the Presi?
dent, has definitely disclaime?! such
a right, and promises that whatever
the outcome of the peace talk the
United States will endeavor to main?
tain its policy of neutrality, the note
loses much of its ir-itatin**- char
arter.
It still is regard?d as untinie!\.
as it is felt the President might have
waited until the Germ?n proposa!
was dispos?**?! of; but there is little
fear that it will arouse real resent?
ment in the Entente cap.tais.
( ount von Hernstorff conferred
w.th Secretary Lansing to-day, and
it was un?lerstt?od that the s?vretary
had explained President Wilson's
a?-tion in addressing* the belligerents.
