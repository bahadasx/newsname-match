to indicate it.s purpose without further
comment on his part.
Ills Meaning i:aggoratod.
Mr. Ijinslng's first statement mado
orally and of which no officlul copy
was distributed, led to exaggerations
of its language and purpose thruout
official Washington. Its most striking
phiases on which the widest specula
tion was based were that the Cnltcd
States was "drawing nearer the verse
of war" and that the sending of tiio
note "will Indicate the possibility of
our bring forced into the. war," anil
that neither he nor President Wilson
regarded the note "as a peace note."
Secretary Lansing's first statement
was as follows:
l-un-lng's Statement.
"It Is not our material inter
est we had in mind when the nolo
was sent; but more and more our
own rights are becoming- involved
by the belligerents on both sides,
so that the situation is becoming
increasiiiKly critical.
"1 mean by that, that we are
drawing nearer the verge of war
ourselves, and, therefore, we are

that we may regulate our conduct
In the future.
"No nation has been sounded.

town or in .what direction they went
in leaving.
Not a clew of any consequence has

yesterday that the station agent at
Skiatook ordered two men from the
right-of-way whom he stated were at

Only a vague description nf the men
was supplied by the agent, this de

was a tall slended man wearing a
black slouch hut while the other was
a short, heavy-set man wearing a cap
that was pulled well down over tho

bond issues in the total sum of 11-5..
llllll.
A tot "I of 1 I.i voles were east, which
was wilhin five voles of the total lut
ing strcnglh of tin- village. A major
ity of the votes cast was all that was
lie essui'v under the law to carry Hie
bonds, but the two lo one majority
removes nil possible doubt.
I he election was gotten un and en
gineered ,v bond buying experts
therefure the legality of Hie bunds Is
beyond iiiesllon.
Open lllds .limitary g.
Ilnls on (he bonds will he opened at
Kendall school house on January S at
X o'clock p. m Afterward they will
be sent lo the attorney-general for Ids
approval. As soon as the bonds are
sold and signed by the trustees of
Kendall Hie village will be made a
part of the city of Tulsa. The cllv
will automatically ass'imn the bonded
Indebtedness. The money 'derived
from the sale of the bonds will ho
spent by the municipal government In
giving the people of Kendall the mod
ern improvements they voted for. Tho
money can be spent for no other pur
pose end In no other part of the city.
C. S. Yntinkmuu, commissioner of
waterworks and sewers, stated last
night that he would begin the task of
cxtciicing the city water mains to
Kciiih.ll early next year. He will use
the ;r..iHiii bond Issue In extending
the main and pining water to the
hemes In Kendall. Coiumhsii.ner
Vouiikmuii also will construct a storm
and sanitary sewer system for Kmdull
lis soon as tho money is available.

park to Kendall, now th it a pink s!to
In the latter place is mule possible.
The file station will be built nnd
fully ii.uipped with the S13.0HU avail
able fi r that pin pose.
Item-fits College.
Dr. Charles Kvnns, president of
Kendall college, was overjoyed last
night at the result of the election.
"I felt all the time that the citi
zenship here would take advantage nf
the opportunity offered them," he
said. "Private property owners have
really had more to do with putting
the bonds over than any ine connected
with the college. The school, how
ever, will go ahead now at wonderful
bounds. The recent gift of JnO.OOO
for n new gymnasium was made con
ditional on the successful outcome of
the bond election. I feel safe In say
ing that the result of the election will
mean many other improvements for
Kendall."
N. li. Orulium. president of the mu
nicipal park hoard, scoffed at the re
po:t that the park bond money would
be used tu imnrove Kendall college
campus. "A site will be purchased
somewhere in Kendall that will be of
benefit to all the citl.ens of that part
of town," he said, "and It positively
will not be adjacent to the c"llego
properly."
League Loses Again.
J It. League, former member of the
biiar, I of education, led the opposition
tu the bunds, bill wus un the lusing
side, r.s usual.
Properly values In Kendall have In
crinsed almost over night. Many own
ers announced last night that all pre
vious prices on their holdings wero
wlthdruwn und were planning in
creases of from 20 to 110 per cent. It
is believed there will be much deuling
in Kendall real estate in the very near
future and that many new and costly
homes will be started. Several bigh
elass additions adiacent to Kendall
are now being platted and will soon
be placed on the market.
The taxable valuation nnd popula
tion that will be added tn the citv of
Tulsa by the furthcoming annexation
will n can much to the citv as a whole.
The suci ess of the bond election Is
gratifying to the entire community.
