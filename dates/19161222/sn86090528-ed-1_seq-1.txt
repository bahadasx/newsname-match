ENGLAND'S PRESS ASSAILS AMERICAN
PRESIDENT'S STATESMANSHIP AND
HIS "HEALTH" IS QUESTIONED
British Digestion of Washington Dove Talk Fails to Justify President Wilson's As.
sumption that Motives of All Allies are Identical; Wilson's Administration
Awaits Calming of the Slorm Confidently and Next Peace Move Must
Come From Warring Foreign Offices
By United Press. '
London, Dec. 22. The more ong
land digests President Wilson's peace
note the more bitter it feels. This
conclusion is drawn from editorials
in the afternoon papers here in de
nunciation of Wilson's move.
The afternoon press is a unit, in
their resentment. The fullness of
their bitterness is particularly mani
fested against Wilson's assertions
that the objects for which all the bel
ligerents are striving are virtually the
same.
"It is singular that a statesman like
Wilson can labor under the delusion
tha his move toward peace would be
welcomed by the allies," said the Eve
ning Standard.
"We sincerely hope that President
Wilson is not ill but we have doubts
about his physical well being," de
clared the London Globe.

AKRON, 0., "RUBBER
CAPITAL OF WORLD"
Akron, Ohio, December 22. The po
sition of All. on as the "rubber capital
of the world" has been so well estab
lished, in the public mind that it Is
doubtful whether any one would ques
tion seriously the claims of the rapidly
growing Buckeye City to the distinc
tion it has won. A recent valuation
of Akron industries for property taxa
tion, completed by the auditing de
partment of tho county in which the
city is located, brings out with strik
ing clearness the predominance of the
rubber manufacturing industry over
any other of the many that have
brought about an increase of approx
imately 300 per cent in the population
of Akron during the past ten years.
Tho taxable value of the great plant
of the B. F. Goodrich company alone
amounts to almost half of the total of
$13,896,440 placed upon the 168 indus
tries located in Akron and Summit
comity. When it is remembered that
included in these 168 industries are
such concerns as the Diamond Match
company and the Quaker Oats compa
ny, it is possible to get an idea of the
immensity of the Goodrich company's
establishment.
.Tust how the rubber manufacturing
business dominates in Akron, and the
immensity of it. is shown by figures
given in it recent article in one of Ak
ron's newspapers, from which the fol
lowing figures are obtained:
Total valuation of all Akron and
Summit county industries, $43,896,410.
The B. F. Goodrich company, $20,
302,830. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber com
pany, $7,631,780.
Firestone Tire & Rubber company,
$1,964,980. ,
Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., $1,371,
930. Miller Rubber Co., $1,121,910.
Portage Rubber Co., $331,880.
Swinebart Rubber Co., $459,270.
A total of $36.220,5SO credited to the
rubber manufacturing industry, more
than four-fifths of the entire manufac
turing activities of Akron and its sub
urbs. A

slowly from yesterday's dizzy whirl
of history-making developments, gov
ernment officials here as well as dip
lomats today looked to the foreign of
fices of the belligerents for the next
peace move.
As outlined by early reports, strong
exceptions to the president's over
tures aro taken by the English and
Canadian press but the administra
tion believes that the feeling is not
strong- enough to gloom the situation.
Members of the allied diplomatic
corps here expressed themselves r
believing that Secretary Lansing's
first 'statement yesterday indicated
that the United States was not acting
in behalf of Germany in making peace
suggestions.
Teutonic diplomats were sonewhat
startled by Lansing's first statement
and they felt somewhat relieved when
the supplementary statement appear
ed in the afternoon.
Lansing's two statement" respect
ing the Wilson note were forwarded
to American diplomats abroad.

BUSINESS
Mayor Coffman Says it Necessary He Will
Confiscate Every Ton of Coal (hat
Comes Into Chickasha
THINKS HE CAN GET
PLENTY EASILY
Two Carloads Arrive to Relieve Situation
and Two More are Expected it
Reach Here Tonight
"If the-coal dealers of Chickasha do
not get busy and get sufficient sup
plies in here to meet tho demands of
public comfort the city will go into
the coal business and furnish it to tho
consumer direct,' declared Mayor
Coffman this morning. "I do not see
why they cannot get supplies. I can
get it without any trouble. I ordered
a carload of coal fourteen days ago
and It has been unloaded into the cel
lar at the city hall for four or five
days. And it did not cost $8 or $!)
a ton either. It cost the city jui;t
exactly $3.65 a ton, which was $2 a
on at the time and $1.65 freight
charges. I told the coal nun yester
day that if they did not prevent suf
fering attending a coal famine in
Chickasha the city would go into the
ousiness in earnest: uud would confis
cate every car of coal that conies into
Chickasha if necessary to prevent un
due suffering. And the city will pay
for all that it gets, too."
Mayor Coffman states that he is
keeping in close touch with the situa
tion and has kept in communication
with the coal dealers for two days.
Two carloads of the fuol arrived here
yesterday evening: tending to relieve
the situation somewhat and two more
cars are expected in by tonight. That
will increase the visible supply mate
rially. "You can hot your life wo will
take action if it becomes necessary,"
were his honor's concluding remarks.
The mayor explained that the $3.63
coal, which of course is the wholesale
price, is giving satisfactory service.
SANE CHRISTMAS
By United Preus.
Oklahoma City, Dec. 22. Now comes
the campaign for a "Sane Christmas,"
"Sane Fourth" having proven a won
derful success. Issuing a plea for the
safe and sane spirit during the holiday
season C. t'. Hammonds, stato fire
marshal, today gave out a statement
in the shape of a warning to people
who will celebrate Christmas in their
homes, and to business men and work
ing people who aro confined in stores
and offices crowded with Christmas
goods. The warning follows:
"We approach the holidays appre
hensive of the carelessness of the peo
ple with Christmas decorating. We
know that a great many people do not
think, or count tho cost, before deco
rating their stores, residences and
churches with cotton, paper, paraffine
candles and other inflammable and
combustible material or they would
not dare to use them. Great fire haz
ards are created, and tho lives and
property of the people are endangered
for mere show or appearance which
does not add materially to the devout
celebration of the birth of the Savior
of men.
"We hope that the "Safe and Sane"
spirit pf the times will prevail through
out the coming holidays, and that the
people will refrain as much as possi
ble from use of eutt.m, paper, paraf
fine candles and other inflammable
materials in deeo-ations and for the
preparation of wigs and clothing to be
worn by those representing "Santa
Claus" and such characters.
"We would also a;lc the people to
be careful in the usj of fire arms and
fire works as the toll of life and prop
erty caused by tho careless use of
these has been enormous."

Stale Board of Education Recommends
$109,000 for Additional Structures,
Dormitory Included
$100,000 IS SOUGHT
FOR MAINTENANCE
President Austin is Pleased and Looks
for Legislature to Be Liberal
to Girls
Minus whiskers and a red nose, the
smiling face of President G. W. Aus
tin, of the Oklahoma Collego for Wo
men, might easily have been mistak
en for that of merry old Santa Claus
himself today when the announcement
was conveyed to him that tho state
board of education asked an appropria
tion of $200,000 for the college, includ
ing $100,000 for new buildings and
$100,000 for maintenance for tho next
two years. If anything other than the
joy linns which started at tho center
of his countenance and terminated
somewhere behind his rnra wan
needod to indicate his feelings of
gratification, his words furnished It.
"I can't deny the fact that I am fold
ing good over the prospects," said Mr.
Austin, "it Is true that we could use
more money than that to excellent
advantages but I am well pleased in
deed with tho action of tho board and
I am sure that the amount suggested
will put the collego in a position to
make a big step forward. We fould
fill tho proposed new buildings right
now and I hope that the bills making
the appropriations will go through
promptly in order that tho additional
facilities may be available at the open
ing of school next year. I believe that
the legislators are going to bo dispos
ed to be liberal in their treatment of
the only school maintained by the
state exclusively for girls. Tho col
lege has outgrown its present capac
ity and if the demands of the people
of tho state who desire to educate
their daughters in such an institution
as we have here are to be met we must
have more buildings. I feel suro that
the legislature will take this view of
it."
It Is understood that the plans of
the state board ci.ll for another dor
mitory and a fine arts building. The
latter building is even more needed
than a dormitory, President Austin
says. "Wo haven't sufficient school
room in our administration building to
properly take care of the students we
have now and with Increased enroll
ment that would come if we had an
other dormitory would be absolutely
swamped. Wo must have a place to
teach the girls as well as a place for
them to live."
The fact that several hundred girls
who applied for admission to the O. C.
VV. this year had to be turned away
because there was no room for them,
it is believed, will be one of the argu
ments that will appeal forcibly to the
legislature when the bills for the il -velopnient
and maintenance of tlm
school come up for consideration.
The recommendations of the state
board of education call for a total ex
penditure of $.3,148,342 for construc
tion of new-buildings, other improve
ments and maintenance of the vari
ous state institutions. Some of the
main building items. In addition to
tho one for the .0. C. W., are as fol
lows: State medical school, $200,000;
Tudtorium at state university, $130,
000; two buildings for the school for
eeblo minded at Enid, $30,000; Wil-
Iburton school of mines, $30,000; school
for incorrigible girls, $23,000.
