Lloyd-George'a reply in s
speech in Parliament Tuesday on
the peace proposal of Germany,
was strong and vigorous, but if
Germany would propose terms
with reparation, restoration and
security for disarmament, the
entente governments would con
sider it, otherwise it was a wax
to bring peace after subjugating
the central powers. .
New York Letter
Laying aside thoughts of business,
and without waiting until the pleas
ant memories of my last visit to thf
old Tennessee home have grows . dim
I want to write a few impressions of
that trip! It is good to 1 drop th
cares and interests of the present fot
awhile and look back upon' the wayf
we have trod, and at ; the scenes ol
other days. It helps keep our heart;
tender and our minds open, and give
us a new grip upon what is before us
Selmer has changed considerably
since my former visit of 1913. Thf
two features most noticeable were the
fine system of concrete sidewalks,
which would be creditable to a towi
of ten times its size; and the neat ap
pearance of newly painted dwelling?
and other buildings. Selmer is now
on a 8oli(J foundation, "and;' will grow
steadily under good business' develop
ments. r It evidently has a good com
munity spirit, and " enough enterpris
ing ' men and women to keep that
'spirit alive, It was good to see the
substantial prosperity that has come
to the 5 v Alexander boys and
other associates of my early days.
Their present status proves a great
truth that I have learned through
long observation: Good boys generally
make good and useful men. Some of
the bad boys I used to know have
tamed out very badly, and the preach
er Talmadge was on the right . track
when be paid thatlhe average child's
character is fixed bv the time he is
welve years old.
Of course one of the first things )
s had to do was to get out to Aunt
Kate Luttreirs, at Law ton. She is
. my mother's only living sister, and
she and Uncle Robert Luttrell are
links of the present with the past, that
. are dear to me. Far from the roar,
. the tinsel glitter and the nerve-rack
ing life of this great city, they live
quietly and sensibly in the house
where my aunt was bora and where
my mother lived in early girlhood; a
typical Tennessee home, where good
substantial food is enjoyed three
times a day, and most of it raised
right there on the place. My aunt
showed me a bread tray in which her
mother bad made up biscuit and
dodger dough from time immemorial.
It is a big, generous tray, made to
serve a family of a dozen, and the
bottom was long worn through with
much use, and was mended with tin,
so that it may serve still another gen
eration of bread-makers. The flour
that has gone through it would feed
an army for awhile. The garden,
back of the house, has to my knowl
edge been in active use for fifty years,

and the soil is better than ever.', a
attested by the big (now frostbitten)
bkra and artichoke stalks and ram
bling tcmito vines (bearing those
sweet little cherry tomatoes, you
know) and the peach trees back of it,
with the many seeds on the ground,
show that it is good for fruit as well.
As a child I lovod to slip into Aunt
Kate's garden when the onion blades
were big, and especially the, seed
stalks with their swelled stems full of
juice, and I spoiled many a stem for
her, for I liked that juice, and do yet.
I saw Aunt Kate milking; saw Un
cle Robert feeding fragrant fodder
and nubbins to the stock; heard the
groaning pigs outside waiting, with
sniffing snoots, for King Corn, while
the billy-goat that's enough about
the billy. His manners wouldn't suit
me if I had a farm, and I'd banish him
to the tall timber if I had a crack at
him. Why is a goat, anyhow? There
were lots of black walnuts and per
simmons, and I enjoyed both to my
heart's content. A, short distance
away is the place where my mother
as born. A big walnut tree stands
in the old chimney place; in the small
house there, I saw the daughter of
one of my old schoolmates, Marcus
Zanders, a distant relative. That soil
had been pressed by the baby feet of
the one who, of. all this earth had
been nearest to me; she had played
under thosn gnarled old white-oaks
now shading the road, that even in
her infancy were hoary with age.
Not many steps westward from ber
birthplace is the cedar-covered bury-ing-ground,
a remarkable promontory
of level ground surrounded on all
sides but one with hollows; and there
she rests,, with father, sister and lit
tle brother, while the wild honey
suckles slowly cover the mounds as if
the hand of time were trying to heal
the scar of grief. Just so, time heals
and veils all things; We'are alt go
ing the same way. , ;
Dr. Henry Sanders makes his home
at the old place, with my aunt and
uncle. Here is a model country doc
tor, modest and busy, self-effacing,
useful and reliable, shrewd in business
and prosperous accordingly; a man
who would be a fine member of the
state or national house of represents
tives, but who has a horror of politi
cal and public life. Many have asked
him to run for the legislature,- but he
can't see it that way, and I think he
is to be commended for keeping out
of politics.' McNairy needs him at
home. It needs more like him . and
his brother Gerry, also a physician,
who is one of the pillars of Stanton
ville. ' Gerry has a lovely wife and a
fine boy, and it would be a crime for
a man like that to run off after poli
tics. Staying at the old homestead
also saw the sturdy boy Theodore,
an adopted son of Dn Sanders. The
odore attends school at old Purdy,
but takes his week-end vacation at
Aunt Kate's. Here is a boy with
genuine love for the farm, and who
will be smart enough not to leave it
when ha grows older, as so many
have done. , ,
' Banker Adams has not let wealth
wean him from the old-time diet, and
at his board I ate well. His daugh
ter, Mrs. Will Abernathy, showed an
astonishing knowledge of live stock
interests, and you know when the la
dies take hold of a thing there .is

osition. -
What I didn't do to the chicken,
hominy, and other savory things
(sausage, for instance) on the liberal
tables of Grant, Harvey, Lee and Joe
Alexander, was not worth doing.
These boys went to school with me,
and they occupy a place with my sen
timents that none others can. How
glorious to be able to stay with those
fine boys all the time (there are about
enough of them for me to stay with
a new one each day till I got back to
the first at the beginning of each week)
and swap my company for my grub.
8nh dreams are vain, and I have got
to get down to work again, and pa;
my way. At Lee s I saw his bright
girls, Jessie and Malissa, sisters of
that wonderful boy Roscoe of such
promise, whom I was sorry to find
away from home. ' I was telling Jes
sie what sort of Latin a big 6mart
Aleck had used here, and she caught
up the mistake, at once. What do
you think of that for sweet sixteen in
Selmer? New York could not beat it.
And I want to say that Jessie can get
up a fine supper. Such a girl as that
does not need to die an old maid.
And that remarkable boy, little Pren
tiss, at Joe Alexander's! He could re
peat, correctly, long sentences from
a German poem after me, and gave
other evidences of a mind that surely
should receive the best possible cul
ture. Prentiss has a. smart sister;
don't forget that. The sweetness and
modesty of those McNairy children
appealed to me. '
Out at Lawton 1 saw a little
maid of eleven who carried on the
housework for her father and four
motherless wee ones. Her tiny broth
er told me with pride that he had
picked over ' fifty pounds of cotton
one day that week, but some one else
told me it was seventy pounds. ' At
Lawton I also saw my cousin Lorraine
Sebring who has gained some distinc
tion by raising sheep, shearing them,
carding the wool, spinning it and
knitting shawls upon which she got
premiums at the fair. That is , inde
pendence for youl And if the horror?
of war are thrust upon us, just
such talents . as these will save the
people from destitution, and it would
not hurt some of them to have to go
back to principles like thai. . And
there was Lorraine's daughter Lydia,
out picking cotton when I was there,
that has a name for intelligence and
industry that would put many a city
girl to the blush. Her boy does a
man's work on the farm. ;
While back at Lawton, 1 1 want to
say something about some most de
licious preserves made by my Aunt
Kats Luttrell front whole muscadine
grapes. They had the real muscadine
flavor, and that is saying that they
were good enough for anybody. ' :
I was proud to meet, at Selmer,
Eliza Davis, who as Eliza Wagner was
a schoolmate of mine. Eliza has long
been a widow, but she took up cheer
fully the burden of self-support, aided
by her spendid children, and she is an
example to other women bereft of
their huabands, showing that they
need not despair nor become a burden
to others. , J , .-."
At Henderson I met my uncle, Dr.
A. L. Sanders, and his brilliant wife
and mother-in-law. He was always
my favorite uncle. I will tell of him
in another letter.
Down in Mississippi I went to see
other friends of my youth. I told
once of the dreadful siege I had with
my first love affair, the girl herself,
an adopted daughter of the late Rev.
Thomas Cotton, being entirely uncon
scious of it at the time. Well, I had
to fee Nettie Cotton (now Mrs. Stub
blefield) of course. At Rienzi I found
a demure-looking lady of middle age.

said she was Mrs. Stubblfieeld. -1 said
I was an officer of the United States
government, looking for a little girl
whom I had lost at old Purdy in Ten
nessee, forty-two years ago. She
asked me the name of the little girl.
I said, Nettie Cotton. Looking up
quiekly she said: "I am Nettie Cot

plantions were soon made; Mr. Stub

there, however, I proceeded to ' solve
the problem that puzzled me . away
back in childhood: what was that
wonderful perfumery on Nettie's hair
that made me distracted; that is like
a grass with a sweet scent known as
vernal grass, and - the scent which
even now thrills me to the core. And
what do yon think ! There was no
perfumery at all. This is a mystery
of nature referred to feelingly ' bv
Opie Reid in his novel of The Juck-
lins, where ,lhe hero is intoxicated
with the ordor of bis sweetheart's
hair., Boys, there's something to that,
but I haven't time to go further into
this most interesting psychological
study. Nettie and ber good husband
and prosperous cnildren all together
there in Rienzi make a bright spot in
my memory, and make me believe more
than ever that things generally hap
pen for the best for other people.
At Corinth I met three wonderfully
interesting people. Col.'' Wiles C,
Meeks greeted me like a son, for he
had known my ancestors, and loved
them in spite of political differences,
as his own family. Now, standing
like a hoary oak in his manly dignity
a perfect picture of the chiv il'.us
and honest Southern gentleman f in
other generation, he still fixes h af
fections on the friends of his nth
and upon their descendants, and
loves the young. for the sake of the
old. What a contrast to the cold and
greedy element one finds here, intent
only upon the sensationsand the in
terests of the hour, and upon their
own welfare! Long may tVa gra'.d
old man live, an example 10 the
younger generation and a reminder
that in character we are not improv
ing upon those who went before us.
Another man well worth meeting was
Henry C Moore, who is generajly sup
posed to be worth millions of dollars,
made in Africa. It is refreshing to
meet a man who has really "done
something.. His every word is sig
nificant; he is equipped with Reserve
force, and he never shows his full

MORE MEN THAN WOMEN
HAVE APPENDICITIS
j -
Surgeons state, men are ' blightly
more subject to appendicitis than
women. Selmer people should know
that a few doses of simple buckthorns
bark, glycerine, etc., aa mixed in
Adler-i-ka, often relieve or prevent ap
pendicitis. This mixture removes
such surprising foul mutter that ONE
SPOONFUL relieves almost ANY
CASE constipation, sour stomach of

Sleeping and. Eating
Sleeping is important. Children
require more than grownups. Don't
weight down your body with heavy
bed covers. Light weiht blankets,
wool and cotlon comforts of luh
weight are excellent. Canton flannel
sheets are good in winter. Outing
flannel gowns are most comfortable.
Feather beds are not sanitary. Any
home can have a cotton mattress and
stout springs. Newspapers art good
to use between springs and mattress.

should always cover the mattress be
