NUMBER 44
Kula Sanitarium Is
Praised By Dr. Pratt
Head Of Health Department Well
Pleased With Maui Conditions
Wailuku Water Now Safe
Particularly gratifying to Maul are
the statements made by Dr. J. B. S.
Pratt, president of the board of health,
who spent several days this week on a
general Inspection, of health condi
tions of this Island. Dr. Pratt had been
preceded by several days by Dr. L. L.
Patterson, the board's expert In
charge of tuberculosis work, and by
M. B. Bairos, assistant food commis
sioner, who had been investigating in
their own special . lines preparatory
to his coming.
Praises Sanitarium
Dr. Pratt was particularly warm In
his praise of the work being done at
the Kula Sanitarium. He and Dr.
Patterson are a unit In declaring the
Kula district to be most eminently
adapted to the treatment of the great
white plague of perhaps any place In
the territory, and they are equally
enthusiastic over what has been ac
complished by Dr. Durney and the
sanitarium board of managers in the
past few years. With the recently In
stalled ice and electric plant In good
runlng order, a big dairy herd, and
plenty of land on which to raise pro
duce for the Institution, the Honolulu
officials see a bright future for Maui's
fight against the destructive malady.
Work on School Starts
Dr. Pratt was particularly pleased
with the progress of the children of
the Institution, for whom school

for a new school building is at present
on the ground.
Defeating Typhoid
In his tour of the plantations by
automobile, Dr. Pratt noted very ex
tensive new construction, and gener-
ally a satisfactory condition as to
camp -sanitation. The big new water
flltratlon system of the Hawaiian
Commercial & Sugar Company is prob
ably one of the most striking illustra
tions of the triumph of science over
' disease. Since the camps of the big
- nlnntntlnn have been supplied With
' filtered water, typhoid fever had al
most entirely disappeared, where be-

Wailuku Now Safe
The Wailuku water supply is now
pronounced safe by the health author
ities since there are now no residences
in-Iao Valley above ten intake. In a
few weeks more the intake will be
located still further up the stream
where contamination will be even less
likely.
Pioneer's New Electric
Plant Very Satisfactory
The new steam turbine electric unit
Installed by the Pioneer Mill Com
pany this summer, and which has
been in operation a number of times
since the grinding season opened, is
giving excellent satisfaction. The
plant, which is of eight hundred k. w.
xannnitv id used to supplement the
company's hydroelectric plant and is
not operated constantly. It is de
clared by experts to be perhaps the
finest installation of the kind in the
Islands.

FOR KULA SANITARIUM
Ralph E. E. Coursen, who with his
arifa have been at the Wailuku Hotel
for some days, is here from Oregon to
take the place of farm manager ior mo

Eye On It '

construction of a $200,000 theater
building for Honolulu, is soon to ac
qu're control of the Valley Islo Theat
er, in Wailuku, Is a report that is cur
rent on Maul at present. The fact
that the Market street play-house Is
in financial straits may have some
thing to do with the rumor, as well as
the fact that Mr. Stone is known to
have looked over the property during
his visit to the Maul county fair. It
is his company which has lately been
supplying films for the house.
The Valley Isle, according to a legal
notice published today, is to be sold

the First National bank for $1700 and
interest. It is said that the company

Husband Disappeared
Over Six Years Ago

Lahaina, Maui, was granted a divorce
by Judge Quinn in the Fourth Cir
cuit Court here last Thursday, on the
ground of desertion, the mystery ol

cleared up by the investigation. Mrs.

or heard of her husband since he dis
appeared on July 10. 1916, when he
left her at Honomu. tnis lsiana.

Dr. Raymond Breaks
With GoyJ'inkham
Resigns Various Offices Sensational
Quarrel May Have Important Poli
tical Results Seems Irremediable
The wireless reports from Honolulu
this week to effect that Dr. J. H. Ray
mond had broken completely with
Governor Pi.nkham, his long-time per
sonal and political friend, excited
much speculation here. At first It
was not believed to be a real breach,
but later reports indicate that Dr.
Raymond has irrevocably cut himselt
off from the chief executive.
The rl'max seems to have come
when, on Tuesday morning Dr. Ray
mond, called at the Capitol and was
refused an audience with the Gover
nor. Mr. Pinkham sent word out that
he was busy, and the Doctor forthwith
returned to his hotel and penned his
resignation of the several offices he
has held under appointment of the
Governor.
"I'm pau with Mr. Pinkham," Dr.
Raymond is quoted by the Advertiser
as saying in the course of a 2-column
interview.
"I'll have nothing more to do with
him. I'll not hold any office under
him. I'll not support him any longer
and I shall have no further interest
in politics. If I were President of the
United Statfcs, I would'nt treat a
pouudmastei the way Pinkham has
treated me." '
Raymond, who says he came to Hon
olulu on private bus'.ness, went to the
Governor's office and sent in his name
with the statement that he would like
to see Governor Pinkham.
"The Governor didn't even have the
courtesy to come out and shake hands
and tell me himself that he was busy
and ask me to call again," said Doctor
Raymond. He just sent out word by
his stenographer that he was busy and
coudn't see me." .
Dr. Raymond went very fully Into
the cause of his disaffection with Pink
ham, who,he terms as an ingrate, and
who he says has insulted and double
crossed him. He says that his politic
al activity during the past few years
was inspired by a friendly desire to
help the Governor.
When at the time of the Democratic
primary last spring, L. L. McCandless
and his faction of the Democratic
party, launched a vigorous and syst..
ematic attack upon Governor Pink-
horn. Raymond, acording to his own
statement, went to the aid of the

Wants Wide Tires But
How Wide Is Question
"I believe the supervisors should
pass a wide-tire ordinance for the
nrotection of our roads," declares W.
I. Wells, manager of the Haiku Co
operative Association, "But some care
should be used in framing sucn a law.
The suggestion that tires should in
crease an inch for each 250 pounds of
load seems ridiculous. What kind of
tire for instance would a man need for
three- or four-ton truck? Let's have
wide tires but let's use reason in the
matter."
John Little To Make Home
In Southern Calfornia
John Little, for the past five or six
years head book-keeper and cashier of
the Pioneer Mill Company, at Lahaina,
has resigned his position and with his
wife and daughter will leave Maui
tonight enroute to Southern California,
where they expect to locate perman
ently. Mr. Little's place has been nuea
by promotion of George L. Keeney,
who has been assistant book-keeper.
The departure of Mr. Little and his
family will be regretted by the many
friends they have made in the islands
during their residence of some twelve
or fifteen years. Defore coming to
Maul Mr. Little was connected with
the Walalua plantation, on Oahu.
FINED FOR STATUTORY OFFENSE
You Chon Hun, a Korean from Pu
unene, and Mrs. William Tulitino, Ha
waiian, of Paia, were convicted before
District Magistrate Anjo, or Manawai,
last week of adultery. The man was
fined $30 and the woman $10.
CHRISTMAS TREE AT
KUIAHA SCHOOL HOUSE
A very pleasant Christmas tree and
entertainment was given on Tuesday
evening at the Kuiaha school house
for the children of the neighborhood
Each child received a present. The
prom-am consisted of reticitations and
music. Mrs. Laura Hills and Mrs.
Will. J. Cooper each rendered vocal
selections. The ladies of the com

County Gets Share
Of Bonus Money
Gamblers Flourish During Fat Season
On Plantations Fines For Week
Nearly $1000
The county of Maul profited from
plantation bonus money to the extent
of nearly $1000 during the past week.
It came in shape of fines and forfeited
cash bail of several dozen Oriental
gamblers taken in the police drag nets.
Most of the raids were made in the
camps of the Puunene plantation
where it is said some big games have
been in progress lately.
With the unwonted prosperity of
plantation laborers at present, due to
the heavy bonuses being distributed,
gambling is said to be flourishing all
over the territory ns never before, and
stories of big winnings are to be
heard. One Japanese from Puunene,
who had gotten a little stake of about
$100 from his hoe hanahana, Bhook
the bones to such good result that he
was swelling around early in the week
with $600 in his pockets. Then he
started for Honolulu, to take a steam
er to Japan, but at Lahaina he lost his
entire pile in less than half a day
when encountered by some fellow
countrymen a little smarter or luckier
than he.
Asks $5000 Damages
' For False Arrest
Chinese Was Searched For Opium On
Warrant Issued By Makawao
Magistrate, And Feelings Hurt
On behalf of District Magistrate
Joseph G. Anjo, of Makawao, County
Attorney Bevins has filed a demurrer
to the complaint of Dang Nam in the
latter's suit for $5000 damages, which
he claims to have suffered through
having had his person seached for
orium, on November seventh. The
.demurrer holds that the action agatnsi
the. magistrate is not warranted. The
case will probably come up after the
first of the year before Judge Edings.
Considerable interest attaches to
the case. The plaintiff Dang alleges in
his complaint, that he was arrested by
Police Officer Joseph Morris on a
"John Doe" search warrant, issued by
Judge Anjo, and subjected to the to
dignity of having his clothing gone
through in the presence of a gaping
crowd. No opium was brought to
light and the damage suit follows.
Eugene Murphey is attorney for Dang.
Judge Edings Reversed
In Hart Bond Case
In a decision handed down today
by the supreme court, orders made by
Circuit Judge W. S. Edings of Maul
holding that his court was without
jurisdiction to hear the cases brought
by the territory against the bondsmen
of Edmund H. Hart, are reversed ana
the cases remanded to the Valley
Island court for further proceeding.
Hart, 'w'ho was circuit court clerk,
recently was convicted of embezzle
ment. The territory sought to recover
the misappropriated funds by bringing
suit against Hart's bondsmen. Pleas
of the bondsmen to the jurisdiction of
the Maui court were sustained and the
territory appealed. Star-Bulletin.
