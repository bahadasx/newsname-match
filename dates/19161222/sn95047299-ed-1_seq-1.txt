VON ENGELKEN GIVES
REAL FLORIDA DINNER
In Washington to Farm Loan
Board A Putnam Coun
ty Spread.
Last Saturday night at .their home
in Washington, D. C, Col. and Mrs. F.
J. II. von Engelken entertained at
dinner the National Farm Loan Board.
The one peculiar .thing about this
dinner is the fact that practically ev
ery article of the menu came ' from
the von Engelken farms in Putnam
county, Florida.
The shad came from the St. Johns
river which flows by the von Engelken
farm, while the grapefruit, oranges,
the sweet potatoes, new Irish pota
toes, the roast pork, lettuce and other
vegetables, the eggs, butter and corn
meal were products of the farm prop
er. Mr. and Mrs. von Engelken's idea
in giving the dinner was that mem
bers of the Farm' Loan Board might
get an insight concerning what this
section of Florida can do in the way
oi farming.
It has been cold in Washington
considerably below the freezing point,
and it was undoubtedly quite a treat
for members of the board to sit at a
table supplied with fresh vegetables
and ;fruits, and to know that there is
one place in the country where a
farmer can have these succulent
things fresh from his own garden and
vine and tree at a time when the bal
ance of the country, frozen stiff, is
feeding its faces on canned goods.
From what .could be learned in a
round about way the von Engelken
dinner was a great success, both so
cially and gastronomicallv.
As Director of the United States
Mint, this Putnam county farmer
seems also to be making a record. He
has at least made some suggestions
that have appealed to business men
and one of which was his suggestion
of a new coin of the denomination of
two and a-half cents. His Buffalo
nickel, on the other hand, will never
get special credit on account of any
artistic merit.
ORGANIZING FOR
LIVE STOCK TRADE
Norman W. Keller of Palatka
is Vice-President of Flor
ida Exchange.
Dinner Party.
Miss Irene Yelverton was hostess
for a three course six o'clock dinner
last evening. Covers were laid for
fourteen, the guests including the
Misses Dorothy Merriam, Oma Davis.
Louise Melton, Nellie Lucas, Mildred
Goethe, and Dorothy Davis; the
Messrs. Robbie Bruce, Lew Barstow,
Fred Leeks, Cromwell Anderson. Bill
Goethe, Warren Sleap and Clarence
Holden. The rooms were beautiful
ly decorated with Christmas bells,
holly and mistletoe. The latter af
forded quite a little merriment as it
was put to the usual tests frequent
ly. Every one enjoyed a delightful
evening.
Married in Jacksonville.
The marriage of Miss Lila Tipton,
formerly of Atlanta and who spent
lu.t winter in Palatka with her aunt,
Mrs. A. M. Hedick, and Johnathan
Franklin Rogers, bookkeeper for the
W A. Merryday Company of this city
took place at the home of the bride,
1823 Laura street Jacksonville yes
terday morning. The bride will be
remembered as a young lady of
charming personality and grace and
her many friends will be delighted to
know that after a brief wedding trip
Mr. and Mrs. Rogers will come to
Palatka and make their home this
winter with Dr. and Mrs. A. M. Hedick.
Col. Strunz' Funeral.
Col. Joseph H. Spafford of New
York, a life-long and close friend of
the late Henry Strunz, with Mr. Wil
liam F. Strunz of Plainville, Conn., a
nephew of the deceased, arrived in the
city late last Friday afternoon to
take charge of the remains.
Funeral services were held at the
Strunz home on N. Third street Sat
urday morning at 10 o'clock, the ser
vice consisting of the simple but im
pressive burial service of the Episco
pal church read by the Rev. Dr. C. R.
D. Crittenton, rector of St. Marks.
The pall bearers were members of
the local bar, Hon. S. J. Hilburn, H.
E. Merryday, J. N. Blackwell, D. M.
Kirby, J. V. Walton and Judge J. C.
Calhoun.
The' body went north in the after
noon over the A. C. L. R'y and was
to have been interred on Tuesday at
Plainville, Mr. Strunz' boyhood home.
At his own expressed wish, the body
was to be buried beside that of his
favorite brother, Mr. William Strunz,
a professional vocalist who died some
two years ago. and who will be re
membered m Palatka by reason of a
visit made here several years ago,
and when he sang at a service in St.
Marks church.
At the request of members of the
family. Judge Haskell has appointed
Attorney D. M. Kirby administrator
of the Strunz estate, at least tempo
rarily, and he is now in charge.
One part of the estate needing im
mediate attention is the big orange
prove pt San Mateo, from which only
about 00 boxes of fruit have so far
been shinned. There is an estimated
cron of at least 5.000 boxes yet to be
chinned. Hapnilv Mr. Kirby is him
self an old oranee grower who has
mnde success of the business, and t is
fnrtiwt" for the estate that manage
ment of the nronprtv has been placed
;n such capable hands.
The live stock industry in Florida
lias grown to such proportions that it
is commanding attention from all over
the country. With the establishment
of the Armour Packing Plant in Jack
sonville a new line of business has
been opened up for commission men
in handling shipments for owners who
do not find it economical or conveni
ent to go to Jacksonville to sell their
products.
The importance of this opportunity
has been grasped by a few live wire
business men who have been active
ly in the field or who have made their
preparations to do a commission busi
ness when the volume of sales show
a material increase as they are cer
tain to do in the near future. The
Jacksonville live stock market is the
great market for the south and al
ready the coming of the Armours is
being followed by shipments to Jack
sonville from almost every state south
of Mason and Dixon's line and east of
the Mississippi.
At a meeting held at the interstate
Stock Yards in Jacksonville last week
ta which live stock commission men
were present from several cities in
the South the Florida Live Stock Ex
change was organized, with the fol
lowing officers:
President B. F. Williamson, of
Williamson & Dennis.
Vice-President, Norman W. Keller,
Secretary and treasurer of the Flori
da Farms and Homes, Inc.
Secretary and Treasurer, Gus Du
pont, of Dupont & Co.
Action was immediately taken to
incorporate the Exchange under the
laws of Florida and to secure a char
ter. The organization of this ex
change will give a guarantee to the
live stock men and farmers through
out the south that their business will
be in trustworthy hands and their in
terests properly protected when con
signed to members of the Exchange.
Coming Social Events.
Next Tuesday evening Miss Vineta
Trombley will give a dance for some
of the younger set; Wednesday even
ing Miss Louise Melton will entertain
with a dancing party in honor of Miss
Dorothy Merriam and her guest, Miss
Florence Hodgson of Tampico, Mexi
co; on Friday night, Mayor and Mrs.
W. P. Merriam will give a dancing
party in the Wilson boat house in
honor of Jack and Dorothy Merriam
and their holiday guests.
Col. Spafford Here.
Col. Joseph H. Spafford, remember
ed only by old time Palatkans as a
former prominent .attorney of this
city, was here over Friday night,
coming down from his home in New
York especially to look after the fu
neral arrangements of his late friend
and former partner, Attorney Henry
Strunz.
Col. Spafford left Palatka in the
nineties; he practiced law here sever
al years and was most successful.
Though a republican in politics, his
fellow democratic citizens had such
confidence in him and such respect,
that at their earnest solicitation he
was appointed by a democratic gov
ernor solicitor of the then newly cre
ated criminal court.
Col. Spafford is now said to be a
very wealthy New York lawyer.
A Beautiful Calendar.
The State Bank of Palatka was
among the first in the field with a new
and beautiful 1917 calendar which it
has been distributing among its cus
tomers during the past week. The
calendar is a beautifully printed pan
el copy of Henry Whitroy's painting,
me Uld Mill," in water colors. It
was of the "Old Mill' that Thomas
Dunn English wrote:
'Here, from the brow of the hill i
look,
Through a lattice of boughs and
leaves,
On the old gray mill with its gam
brel roof,
And the moss on its rotting eaves.
I hear the clatter that jars its walls,
And the rushing water's sound,
And I see the black floats rise and
fall
As the wheel goes slowly round."
Masked Ball.
The leap year masked ball given in
the Putnam House Friday night by
the ladies was a most artistic suc
cess and an .enjoyable occasion.
The costumes were varied and many
quite ingenious. At nine o'clock the
grand march began, led by Mr. and
Mrs. Arthur Corcoran and Mr. and
Mrs. Warner T. Hamm, both couples
being attired in folly costumes. The
judges awarded the prizes to Mrs.
Arthur Corcoran, and Noah Tilghman,
Jr., who was attired as a fairy prince,
and the booby prize went to Mr.
Chamberlain who was attired as a
nurse and carried a baby with almost
motherly instinct. The dances were
enjoyed till 10:30 when supper, ar
ranged at small tables, was an
nounced and the guests did full jus
tice to the menu which consisted of
chicken salad, olive sandwiches, coffee,
ice cream and cake. The formal
dancing began after supper and the
dancers enjoyed a delightful evening.
The patronesses were Mesdames S. J.
Hilburn, J. H. Haughton and Ed. L.
Mann.
Study Food Values
Food provided for the family table de
serves the careful thought of every house
wife. Do you use thought when buying
baking powder?
The quality of cake, biscuits and all
quickly raised flour foods depends largely
upon the kind of baking powder used.
Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar derived from grapes. It is
absolutely pure and has proved its excel
lence for making food of finest quality and
wholesomeness for generations.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate.

SHOULD GIVE IMPETUS
10 DAIRY FARMING
Country About Palatka Has
Advantages for 'I his
Industry.
The Southern Railway's .dairy and
live stock equipment cars will visit
Palatka January 17. There is a very
decided awakening to the opportuni
ties for successful dairy farms in this
section of Florida, particularly in the
Palatka territory which is so conve
nient to Jacksonville and the East
Coast resorts.
Palatka itself is a very attractive
market for dairy products as it is im
possible to get fresh cream in any
quantity, and there is a growing de
mand for guaranteed milk which in
itself is a scarce commodity.
The Southern Railway's cars are
fitted up with complete modern equip
ment for farm dairies and the experts
in charge of the cars will give a de
monstration in the use of the equip
ment. This is a matter that should
appeal to the members of the Farm
ers' Union as the time is ripe for a
cooperative creamery or dairy, and
such an enterprise is along the lhies
for which the Union is organized.
The visit of the cars will be made
the occasion for boosting the dairy
cow in Florida. Recently the Amer
ican Jersey Cattle Club of New York
has been taking an interest in pro
moting the more extensive introduc
tion of the Jersey cow in this sectipn.
The Jersey is already a great favo
rite in the Palatka territory and the
way is pretty well paved for the work
of the club.
Plans are being made to organize
a Jersey Cattle Club in Florida and
letters are being sent out to the own
ers of registered cows throughout the
state to interest them in the move-,
ment.
