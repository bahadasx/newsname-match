NEWPORT
The men of the Presbyterian
Church gave another of their
popular dinners In the banquet
room of the Church building on
Friday evening, Dec. 15th from
6 to 6 o'clock P. M.. The menu
consisted of the following ar
ticles, Walport . salad, clam
chowder, hot biscuits with hon
ey, roast beef with gravy, roast
pork with apple sauce, mashed
potatoes with . cream, baked
beans, carrot pudding and hot!
coffee with cream and sugar. !
One hundred and thirty plate3
were set. The following experts
were in charge of the cooking:
Mr. Reslnger made the biscuits,
256, which were fine and all eat
en. James Ral made the chow
der and It was good enough for
a queen. S. G. Irvin roasted .the
meat and it was delicious. T. H.
Hallcck mashed the potatoes
with cream and it was rich en
ough to please the most fastid
eous epicurean and it was good
enough for our grandmothers
who mashed potatoes in the
same way. Mr. Sheffield made
. the coffee and for flavor and
mild cxhilerating effect could
not be excelled. Rev. Pratt
made the salad, sauce and pud
ding and it was so fine that some
of the ladies seemed to be jeal
ous of his success. Mr. Hickox
Was dish washer and the dish
cloths and dishes seemed to be
as neat and clean as a pin. The
ladies gave no suggestions
or Information in regard to the
cooking at all. The men were
, left entirely to their own know
ledge of the art without any help
whatever from the ladies. Each
woman, girl or boy paid for their
own dinners. Each of he cooks
had clean hands and - spotless
white aprons and no flour on
their nose3. The waiters were
- also neat and clean and consist
ed of the following young men:
Lyal and Harold Colver, Donald
Armatige, Harold Wygant and
Harold Snider. Elmer Patrick
was master of ceremonies. The
social and financial part of the
entertainment was a great suc
cess. Every body enjoyed the
unique features of the feast
and were well pleased and said
they hoped to be on hand at the
next feast a year from now. At
that time we hope it will be a
chicken dinner and that two
hundred plates will be set in
stead of 130.
News was received Monday
evening by Mr. Gustison of tLe
Life Saving Serrice that Cap
tain Charles D. Stuart died Sun
day morning at 7.30 in the Mar
ine Hospital, San Francisco. The
Captain had been operated on,
Saturday previous and died from
the effects of the operation. He
went to San Francisco about
two months ago. Friday he
wrote a letter to Mr. Gustison,
Baying he was feeling fine but
was going on the table Satur
day for an operation. The sur
geons told him he might get
along six or eight months al
right but the trouble would re
turn again. It was stomach and
liver disease. lie also wrote let
ters to other members of the
crew bearing the Bame cheerful
news, that he was feeling bet
ter. Ills wife and little son
Earnest' were present when he
passed i away. . Captain Stuart
came to Newport in 1911 and
took the place of Captain Well
ander who was pro
moted to the Superentendency
of this district with head quar
ters at San Francisco. Captain
Stuart had been in the Marine
Service about thirty years and
Vas'near the time when he
would have been retired on a
pension. It is said Captain
Stuart saved more lives of fish
ermen while on the . Columbia
Itiver thart any other surfman.
He often spoke of the good Unto
he would have when released
from the service. The Captain
Was about GO years old. He had
many friends in Newport wto
were shocked to hear of his suiU
ri?n death. He had attained a
high place In the Marine Service.
Captain Stuart waB noted for
his cool, deliberate Judgement
, and undoubted courage. No
ea was too rough or night too
dark for Captain Stuart to re
fuse to go to the assistance of
thos 3 who were perishing at sea.
He was a man of few words, but
thoroughly competent to do his
duty under the most trying cir
cumstances. He served as surf
man for twenty years on ,the
Columbia River and knew the
dangers of that place, and had
saved the lives of numerous fish
ermen on the rough seas of Pea
cock Spit The crew liked
Captain Stuart and would cheer
fully go Where he ordered them
but he never ordered them to
go where he would not go him
self. But his life's chapter is
now closed and he has passed
over the "Great Divide" to
solve the mysteries of the un
seen world. Who knows but
that he may be with Joseph
Briggs and other friends who
have passed on before and have
anchored their life boat on the
other shore, where storms cease
to come and the ring of the,
alarm bell is never heard. Capti
Stuart is survived by his wife,
his son Earnest and a sister,
Mrs. Taylor who lives in the
state of Washington. The in
terment, I understand, will take'
place at the cemetery at Nah;
