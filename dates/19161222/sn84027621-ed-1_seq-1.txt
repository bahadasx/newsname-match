If you have not sent in your nomi

j Ten Million Dollars to be Raised for
Destitute Jews in Europe
and Turkey
I (Associated Press)
New York, Dec. 22. A campaign
for the raising of $10,000,000 during
the year 1917 for the relief of Jewish
war sufferers opened with a mass
meeting at Carnegie hall last night.
The Rev. Dr. Judah L. Magnes, act
ing vice chairman of s the American
Jewish Reliei Committee who has re
cently investigated the condition of
Jews in Europe, opened the meeting
with an appeal to the Jews of Amer
ica to supplement the generosity by
which they have, since the war be
gan, contributed more than $6,000,
000, by a supreme effort to raise an
additional $10,000,000 during the next
year.
"Those of us in America," he said,
"who have not actually, seen with
their own eyes, cannot begin to pic
ture what it means for a whole peo
ple to be on the verge of starvation,
and for a large part of that people to
he actually starving. ,
"Peace, should it come, will not at
once ameliorate their condition. The
devastation has been to great; the
overthrow of normal economic condi
tions has been absolute and there will
be for years widows and orphans to
be provided for, aged men to be suc
cored and able bodied men and women
to be found employment.
"I have suggested, and my sugges
tion has been received with favor,
that the Jews of America raise a fund
of as many millions as there be need
ed, to be loaned without interest, to
accomplish this rehabilitation where
ever it may be needed. From what
we know of the Jewish people we need
have no fears as to the security, for
that is to be found in the character
and racial stability we' boast.'.'
SOME NOTES ON
THE FUEL SITUATION
The city of Ocala will have to pay
$2.25 a cord for wood.. Jt's steep but
it will have to be did.
There was a little stack of pine and
a little bigger stack of green wood at
the plant this moving. Teams were
steadily hauling in more wood and if
the weather clerk will quit being
mean to us, we will be all to the good.
Meanwhile, buy some candles. We
bought a dozen before penning this
altruistic advice.
Joe Caldwell tis doing all the wor
rying. Joe may send around a . squad to
commandeer all the drygoods boxes
at any minute.
Joe was consulting City Attorney
Hocker this morning as to whether he
had authority to burn all the fences
in town or not. Mr. Hocker said he
AAvJ tJi'nt f Viot-q wr b nn v niitTinritv
to burn the iron fences, but as for
the wooden ones to burn them 'any
how. Joe locked longingly at the veranda
and railings of the Ocala House and
confided to the reporter that they
would keep the furnaces warm for
almost two days.
The Miniutiae says, "Watch your
woodpile; the city is short on fuel."
George Pasteur at the Ocala Steam
Laundry has a lot of good seasoned
wood, and every time Joe Caldwell
passes that way he breaks the tenth
commandment. George expects to
sleep on that woodpile the next fewj
nights. . j
Menaces to Navigation in the Panama
Canal Have Been
Removed
(Associated Iress)
Panama, Dec. 22. The slides in
Baillard Cut which have been menac
ing navigation have been overcome.
Today the channel is in better shape
than it has ever been before. For a
minimum width" of 180 feet it is 35
feet deep, and it is at least 30 feet
deep clear across the original prism,
300 feet wide. The slides at Cucar
acha and Culebra' which have bulged
forward as if to smother the water
way under their mass have been
dredged away until they look flat and
impotent. Barring some unforseen
devolpment, such as a new break in a
wholly unexpected place or the "
crumbling of the great cliffs of brec
cia at Gold Hill or Contractor's Hill,
the" interruptions of traffic by the
slides are done.
The engineers in charge will not
commit themselves to prophecy but
they say the cut is in the best shape
it was ever in, and the fact that they
have taken away all but three of the
dredges and cut out the Sunday and
holiday work is a strong indication of
their confidence in 'the situation. The
three dredges are' carrying the ex
cavation back of the original channel
line in order to iestablish a defensive
zone to prevent encroachments on the
channel. Much work is yet to be done
to complete the channel to its full
width of 300 feet with a bottom 40
feet above sea level, giving a depth of
45 feet, but it is already possible now
to give passage to the biggest ships
on the seas without any trouble.
