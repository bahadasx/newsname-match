Feel That
Wilton Hopes to if|*jc» United State#
Clearing House *«r Vlewe on War
and Possibly For Peace Term*.
Washington, Dec. 22.—With the pur
poses of the president's note to bellig
erents clarified by ofBcial statements
on
the subject, the attention of the
United States has turned to the re
ception of the note in the foreign capi
tals.
Diplomats here are eagerly •watching
for indications of whether the Euro
|w»nn neutrals will follow the lead of
the United States and make a similar
appeal to the warring powers.
There is a growing feeling that the
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for views on war and
possibly for terms of the belligerents.
Several of the diplomats have advised
their governments to that effect. In
order to guide them in their replies.
Surprise at. the fast growing sig
nificance of the president's move was
expressed on ail sides, where it was
Pointed out that at first the opinion
prevailed that the note was merely a
"feeler" and that the most Immedi
ately contemplated result in issuing It
Was the receipt of some sort of defini
tion from the warring nations. That
the president should let it be known
indirectly to the diplomats for their
guidance that he went even farther
that and counted on a frankre
ply which vndd lead to aa actual op
portunity lor negotiations, proved only
$ less, surprising than the actual note
itself.
Othsr Neutrals May Aot.
Thlsfeeling was introduced by Sec-
authorised statement
yesterday that no soundings bad been
lafeeii the attitude of the warring
nations addressed a*"1
that ttle note
ixflT bee?j »»nt- regardless of- central,
^Th^i Question velrjr much to the fore
.'today was whether the European -ileur
trails .would present a united appeal.
The Spanish and Swiss representatives
here have beeh at the state department
repeatedly since the proposals of Ger-.
many came out and probably know
nbw fully the plans of this government.
It is pointed out that the European
neutrals have Buffered more than any
other nations not in the war and that
peace Is more essential to them than
to* any but the actual belligerents. In
addition, they have none of the bitter
tiess of war and none of its ambltons
and are anxious more -for the coming
Of peace than for the accomplishment
of any other purpose.
Nevertheless their geographical po
sition between the two contending
forces has been so dangerous that up
to now they have been able to do no
more than maintain their neutrality
without mixing in the struggle, even to
suggest peace. Part of this danger is,
however, thought removed by the
American action.
Will Ask Friendly Reply.
There is gradual clarification among
the entente diplomats here of the pur
pose of the United States and indica
tions are that they will advise their
governments to reply in a friendly
spirit This proved gratifying today,
as
it was pointed out, both in the'note
Itself and in Secretary Lansing's ex
planation, that one of the dangers was
that the allies would consider the step
as' a .pro-German, move. Every effort
was made to remove this .Impression
tn have the note considered apart
entirely from any otner ewuto. The
entente, diplomats, at first very fearful,
have now accepted this view.
Charge Crew reported to the state
department today that the president's
peace note had been received In Ber
lin.
It is stated officially that the .presi
dent would not presume to say that the
two groups were fighting for the same
object, but merely that their official
spokesmen Jiad outlined much the same
general program, without going Into
the-actual details which he now seeks.
Several hundred telegrams congrat
ulating President Wilson on his peace
note arrived today at the White House.
Practically all of them construed the
note as a move for peace. They came
from
individuals and organizations.
The White House telegraphers were
kept busy for hours receiving the mes
sages.

two statements of yesterday on Presi

mats abroad for the iRionnaiiun vf lbs

AWAIT ACTION BY ALLlEfe^
No Statement Regarding Presidsnt's
Note Forthcoming From London.
London, Dec. 22.—The British gov
ernment will make no statement at
present In regard to President Wllscn's
peace note, considering it a question to
be dealt with, only in communication
with the other members of the en
tente. Announcement was made of th'.s
effect in the house of commons today
by Andrew Bonar Law, chancellor of
the exchecquer and government leader
in the house.
Mr. Law was asked whether a state
ment could be made regarding the
American note. He replied:
"It must be obvious to the house
that this is a question that can only
be dealt with in communication with
our allies and that it is impossible to
make a statement now."
MOVEMENT WILL END WAR.
Cardinal Gibbons Believes Peace in
Europe Not Far Distant.
Baltimore, Md., Dec. 22. Cardinal
Gibbons believes the peace proposal by
the German government and the an
swer to it by Lloyd-George, the British
premier, mark the beginning of a
movement that will end in peace. The
cardinal said yesterday:
"Like many others I was delighted to
learn that the door was not shut abso
lutely and I hope that the friends of
peace will be able to fling it wide
open."
"Do you believe there is definite
prospect of peace?" he was asked.
"Yes," he answered, "the way was
left open and I hope and believe that
as the belligerent nations continue to
discuss peace their enmity will de
crease. The British premier was very
cautious, but he left the way open."
TO MAKE SEPARATE REPLIES.
Entente Nations, However, to Send
Notes to Berlin Simultaneously.
London, Dec. 22.—While the replies
of the various allied governments to
Germany will be made simultaneously
and probably before Christmas, as in
dicated last night, yet these replies
will not be textually identical and will
aot take the form of a joint reply.
The reason for. this is that while all
the entente allies are agreed on the
general principles of the reply, each
came into the war under different con
ditions calling for a somwhat differ
ent statement.
For example, 'tbe defense of small

Similar differences in-the conditions
exist as regards France, Roumaniaand
other counties, so that while all the
replies will agree on the essential par
ticulars of reparation and security,
they will not be Identical.
REJECT GERMAN PROPOSAL.
Russian Government Considers Note
Already Adequately Answered.
Petrograd, via London, Dec. 22.—Since
the text of the German peace proposal
transmitted thru the American em
bassy to the Russian foreign office is
almost Identical with the declaration
already received thru the press unoffi
cially the Russian government, the As
sociated Press Is Informed, considers
that the offer of the central powers has
already been adequately answered. The
official reply In conjunction with Rus
sia's allies, will be made as purely a
matter of form and will ^contain no new
points. It is stated that It will embody
official sentiment heretofore expressed
and will emphatically reject the pro
posal on the ground that its. vaguesness
and lack of sincerity as s.o regarded by
the Russian government do not permit
of tis serious consideration.

Telegraph dispatch from The
Hague says it is announced semi
officially that should the allies in
their reply to the peace proposal
of the central powers leave the
door open for negotiations Germany
will make known her chief peace
terms at once.
London, Dec. 22.—The general public
had their first news of the peace note
from the United States from the papers
this morning and the matter was the
one topic of discussion on incoming
suburban trains and thruout the city.
The people, like the press, were rather
taken aback, as they had about con
cluded that Premier Lloyd-George's
speech had put an end to all peace talk
unles® the central powers In their reply
to the premier were prepared to offer
their terms. That the United States
president or other neutral ruler would
takt action was furtherest from their
minds.
The evening papers, which do not
print editorials, came oat with big
headlines which expressed their view3.

As to the question of tne objects of
the belligerents being the same, the
Star fh^its allusion to President Wil
son's wards In this case says!
"This Is an astounding statement
which%e*can
not with the best wlU In
the world reconcile with the facts."
Globe Sarcastic.
The Globe today gives a secondary
place to its comment on President Wil
son's note which is made in a satirical
vein under the heading, "W hat Is the
Matter With Him?"
"We sincerely hope President Wilson
is not unwell," says the Globe. "Yet
we find ourselves gravely doubtful as
to his physical wellbeing.
The paper then goes on to ask if the
president has never heard of what the
Germans did tn Belgium and Serbia
and confesses that it finds Itself unable
to believe he knows these things when
he describes the central powers aa de
sirous of securing small states against
aggression. The high cost of living is
said to be hitting the average Ameri

count in some way for the milk of hu

Star Approves.
The Star In Its comment says:
•President Wilson's note is a Christ

plete surprise to us. Let us say at
once that the allies in general and
Great Britain in particular ought to
treat it with the most sympathetic re

"Mr. Wilson is one of the greatest

things that we as a nation believe li.
His Ideals are our Ideals. We gladly
give his words the hearing due to a
friend speaking in behalf of friends.
We refuse to question his sincerity or
his slnglemlndness. The spirit of his
Christmas sounding is the right spirit.
It is a spirit which we believe animates
the British people and thehr allies and
which they are not afraid of sounding."
The Edinburgh Scotsman says Presi

position of an Interlocutor on the side

Occupied by Old Men, Women and
Children.
Wichita, Kan.. Dec. 22.—At least five
persons were missing and several were
suffering from Injuries as the result
of a fire that destroyed the main build
ing of the Kansas Masonic home early
today. In addition many old men,
women and children were exposed to
the effects of the flames and cold
weather. Many were rescued with
difficulty and several made uncon
scious by the smoke and fire or over
come by the cold. As they fled from
the burning structure in their night
clothes they were taken to a hospital
and private homes.
Joseph Deck, who was believed to
have been burned under a bed, where
he was seen by a rtreman, was later
found at a nearby home.
Loss Estimated at $230,000.
The homo was the property of the
Masonic lodge of Kansas. The chapel,
valued at $10,000 and the hospital,
valued at $9,000, were the only build
ings saved. The loss was estimated at
$250,000.
The lire started in the boiler room
and had gained great headway before
discovered by a passerby.
Two bodies, one that of a man. later
were found in the ruins of the home.
Both were so badly burned as to make
identification Impossible.
More Bodies Are Found.
Shortly before noon two more bodies
were found, making a total of four that
have been taken from the ruins. All
were those of adults, but It was impos
sible to identify them. They were in
the basement In eighteen inches of
water. They were found under rooms
which had been occupied by Mr. and

ALL MUST AID "CAUSE.*
Even Women May Volunteer to Help
Necessary Trades'in England.
London. Dec. 22.—The broad lines of
the government's scjieme for national
enrollment for war tf'ork which Neville
Chamberlain has been asked to carry
out are these, according to the lobby
correspondent of the Daily News:
All males in the country and not in
the army—probably from 16 years of
age and upward, and certainly to 60
will be required to enroll for war work.
The government considers that
women should be allowed to volunteer,
but at present women are not included
in the scheme.
The machinery to be set up thruout
the country under Director of Public
Service Chamberlain for enrollment
will consist, it is understood, of offi
cers in different centers, with advisory
committees. It is hoped this voluntary
enrollment
will be a complete enroll­
ment of males who are not serving in
the army.
Chamberlain's department will then
direct which Industries, apart from,
war work essential or to some extent
necessary, and what proportion of
workers they need also, of whether
any of the Industries still in being can
be dispensed with during the war.
To take an example from the tin
plate trade. It is not intended that tin
plates be used any longer for pack
ing such commodities as tobacco and
mustard, and the skilled men thus re
leased from this Industry will probably
to steel works.
War work is confined primarily to
munitions »nd food. In the latter case
not only work on land is ro'i'uircd for
production, but the labor of distribu
tion and regulation under the more
rigorous conditions which gradually
will be adopted.
The essential Industries will start,
no doubt. With shipbuilding, the mer
chant service, railways, and mines.
The transfer of workmen from the
skilled trades to munition or other war
work was begun some time ago. Mr.
Hodge gave special attention to this
under the late ministry, and more than
2,000 workmen thus far have been
moved.
CAMPAIGN FOR $10,000,000.
Huge Sum to Be Raised For Relief of
Jewiah War Sufferers in 1917.
Now York, Dec. 22.—A campaign for
the raising of $10,000,000 during the
year 1917 for the relief of Jewish war
sufferers opened with a mass meeting
at Carnegie Hall last night. The Rev.
Dr. Judah L. Magnes, acting vice chair
man of the American Jewish Relief
Committee, wnc ha* rsccntly Inv^tu
gated the conditldn of Jews In Europe,
opened the meeting with an appeal to
the Jews of America to supplement the
generosity by which they liave, since
the
war
began, contributed more than
$6 000,000, by a supreme effort to raise
an additional $10,000,000 during the
next year.
"Those of UB In America,' he said,

Miles E»» Sues—Elaborate Prep

gion
^CT
Incijraiona by Turks.
While winter weather la giving
pauae to operation* on moat of the
fighting fronts, activity is develop
ing in sectors far enough south to
admit of energetic campaigning.
On the Tigris the British after a
long period of quiet, have recently
pushed forward csiose to Kut-JBl
Axnara on the south and are con
tinuing to attack the Turkish
forces there, evidently In the hope
of resuming their long-delayed
march toward Bagdad.
Another field of activity Is at
tracting attention with today's an
nouncement from London that
British forces have taken El-ArUh
In Egypt on the Mediterranean,
ninety miles east of the Sues canal.
Little has been heard from the
Egyptian operations for some time,
but the British have been making
elaborate .preparations to proteot
the canal region from further in
cursions, such as last summer's,
and their defensive lines have been
pushed far out on the Slnal penin
sula. Apparently there has been
an effort still further to extend the
defensive sone, of which the cap
ture of Bl-Arlsh continues an im
portant development.
The taking of Sl-A.rlsh estab
lishes the British front at this
point well towards the border ot
(Palestine and marks the south
eastern penetration by British
forces here since the Turkish ralda
began.
El-Arlsh has been the object pre
viously of attack by British aviat

solves the saored union of the country
before the foe by attacking one das* of
citizens that It Is a violation of the
right of every cltlsen to trade, and that
