WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. A de
finite plan for universal military
training will be laid before Con
gress next month in the Shape of
a bill formulated by the general
staff of the army, accompanied by
complete estimate of cost as com
pared with the voluntary system.
Major General . Hugh L. Scott,
chief of staff, told the House
military committee today that the
work was in progress and would
require about a month to 'complete.
Chairman Dent said the commit
tee would be glad to see the bill.
In response to a laughing ques
tion as to who would introduce it
in the House, Representative
Kahn of California said:
"I would be glad to have the
honor to introduce it."
Scott Quizzed.
. General Scott was subjected to
sharp cross examination on his reiter
ated expression of universal measure
based in part on the voluntary system
atL shown in the mobilization of the
national guards for border "service.
Five of the 32 members tctok occasion
to assure their belief in the theory of
universal service, while two era-J
Dhatically declared against such a sys-
tern. Those favoring were Representa
tives Kahn. Green of Vermont, and
Tilson of Connecticut. Republicans,
and Olney of Massachusetts, and Far
ley of New York. Democrats, while
those 'opposed were Representative
McKeller of Tennessee, and Quinn of

Democrats.
Guard Officer in Savor.
The statement of Mr. Tilson. him
self a colonel in the national guard,
followed General Scott's repeated as
sertion that the federalization of the
national guard accomplished as far as
possible by the national defense act,
would not meet the country's military
needs.
"Many members, a majority of the
national guardt-men who come back
from the border are in favor of uni
versal service," declared the chief of
staff.
Says System Bum.
"I agree with you," said Representa
tive Tilson, "that voluntary military
service is not an adequate system and
probably Would break down in time of
war as it has done before. The na
tional guard system in particular is
economically unwise, because of the
duel control over the forces by the
federal government and the state.
Taking up the report on the mobil
ization of the guard which .General
Scott presented tJ support his arraign
ment of the volunteer system. Repre
sentative Tilson continued.
"Do you think it is quite fair to
the national guards?"
"In what respect?" asked General
Scott
"Don't you think, general, that in
view of the enormously greater task
of the regular service as the agent
which conducted the mobilization the
regular army fell down harder in pro
portion than the national guard?"
"We make many criticisms of our
selves," General Scott said, adding
that a report on the army of the mobil
ization already had been asked for and
would be presented.
"That is what I want to appear in
this record," said Representative Til
son, "because I want to show that no
set of officers, no matter how well
trained, could make this national
guard system work."
Tennesseean Opposed.
Representative McKellar declared he
was "one American" who did not wish
to follow the example tf Germany and
France in raising and training armies.
When Representative Quinn put a
question to the witness on the as
sumption that Congress might pass
such a bill. Representative McKeller '
interjected :
"You need not fear. It will not."
Miuissippian Opposed.
"It won't expect over my vote,"
added Representative Quinn. The

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 21. The stoc,k
market today went through the most
exciting day in its history with one
exception. President Wilson's note to
the belligerent powers, followed by
Secretary Lansing's first explanatory
statement of its intent, were the oc
casion of frenzied selling, which in
scope and volume fairly dwarfed all
the operations which followed on the
peace proposals from Germany.
Prices were slaughtered to the ex
tent of five, ten and Often points, and
in 'one case 33. and the day's sales
amounted to 3,176.$$$ shares, a total
without precedent since the famous
Northern Pacific corner of 1907. The
decline was virtually unchecked, only
a few nominal rallies marking the
trading of the final hour.
The liquidation of the forenoon,
amounting to m'ore than 1,300,000
shares alone, was confined, as has
been the case in the recent operations
to the so-called "war brides" or stocks
which might be adversely affected by
the declaration of peace, but soon
after the publication of Secretary
Lansing's statement suggested that
the United States was "drawing near
to the verge of war," rails also began

England and Allies Now Wait
for Germany to Submit
Terms, Then They May Sit
Around Festive Peace Table
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON", Dec. 21. Absolute and
j startling surprise was the first feeling
in Great Britain aroused by President
Wilson's note. The government was
surprised and frankly admitted so.
The members of parliament were
equally surprised when the news was
spread through both houses during
the morning session.
Newspaper offices were surprised
and the public will be equally sur
prised when they read Ambassador
Page's statement to the foreign office
in the morning papers. All Informa
tion from America in the last few
days, both in dispatches from the us
ually best Informed Washington cor
respondents and in addresses to the
banking and business firms, has said
that the President had no Intention
of taking any steps toward peace or
making any move in European affairs.
When he transmitted Germany's note
to Great Britain without comment, it
was assumed that this action repre
sented his general attitude toward the
European situation.
Want German Terms
Most of the newspapers commented
upon this course with satisfaction.
The tenor of their comments tomor
row will be that Premier Lloyd
George's speech and the speeches of
the Russian, French and Italian
statesmen have affirmed the entente
ailies' position and that unless the
German government gives notice of
the nature of the proposals which it
would bring to a conference the allies
cannot accept the invitation to sit
around an European council table.
TO SLAY FRIEND
keep house for him and his small son.
No trouble was noticed for months
and until several weeks ago there was
no indication of friction between the
men. Neighbors have heard several
arguments of late, however.
Carson, according to his statement,
after being told somethiug by his
wife yesterday, went down town and
purchased a 28-calibre Colt, double
action revolver. He entered the house
about 6 o'clock yesterday evening and
after a few words, commenced shoot
ing at Roberts. One bullet hit the
man to the right of the breast bone,
the other two entered Roberts' head
Death was Instantaneous.
Carson was arrested and taken to
Jail where he now is. He may te ar

in Shawnee, Oklahoma, has been noti
fied of the affair. Roberts originally

(Dy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Pres
ident Wilson's note to the bellig
erents urging discussion of peace
was officially interpreted today
as not bearing any threat that the
United States might be forced to
enter the war because of the con
tinued invasion of its rights by
the warring powers on both sides.
To Correct Error
This interpretation was made late
today by Secretary Lansing in a for
mal statement issued to overtake
what was characterized as widespread
misconstructions placed on the one
given out earlier in the day saying
that because of the increasingly criti
cal position of the United Stales as a
neutral it was entitled to know exact
ly what each belligerent seeks in or
der that it might regulate ita conduct
for the future.
U. S. Stays Neutral
Secretary Lansing's final statement
formally prepared and issued after he
had been called to the White House
for a conference with President Wil
son, declared that he ha I not intended
to lntiniate that the United States
was considering any change In its
policy of neutrality and that the
tone and language of the note were
sufficient to indicate Its purpose with
out further comment on his part.
Not Near War
Mr. Lansing's first statement, made
orally and of which no official copy
was distributed, led to exagserations
Df its language and purpose through
out official Washington. ' Its most
striking phrases upon which the wid
est speculation was based was that
the Unitod States was "drawing near
er the verge of war." and the sending
of the note "will indicate the possibil
ity of our being forced Into the war."
and that neither he nor President Wil
son regarded the note "as a peace
note."
Here is Original
Secretary Lansing's first statement
was as follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the
note were as follows:
"It is not our materia! interest we
had in mind when the note was sent '
but more and more our own rights are
becoming Involved by the belligerents
on both sides, so that the situation is
becoming increasingly critical.
"I mean by that, that we are draw
ing nearer the verge of war ourselves
and therefore we are entitled to know
exactly what each belligerent seeks
in order that we may regulate our
conduct in the future.
"No nation has ben sounded. No
consideration of the German over
tures or of the speech of Cjoyd
George was taken into account, in the
formulation of the document. The on
ly thing the overtures did was to dt
lay it a few days. It ns not decided
to send it until Monday. Of course,
the difficulties that face the President
were that it might be construed as a
movement toward peace and In aid of
the German overtures. He specifical
ly denies that this was the fact In the
document itself."
Secretary Lansing further said:
"The sending of this note will indi
cate the possibility of our being forced
into the war. That possibility ought
to serve as a restraining and sobering
force safeguarding American rights.
It may also serve to force an earlier
conclusion of the war. Neither the
President nor myself regard this note
as a peace note; it is merely an ef
fort to get the belligerents to define
the end for which they are fighting."
Excites Washington
When word of what the secretary of
state had said spread throughout the
capital it created the greatest con
sternation in official circles and
r.mong the foreign diplomats, many
of whom were calling at the tate de
partment to receive their copies of the
note dispatched to their capitals.
