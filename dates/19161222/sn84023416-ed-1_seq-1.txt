APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM
What the Grand Trunk Railway
Is Doing in Helping Young
31 en to Become Skilled Mechanics.
All the industries today call for
trained workmen, men skilled in the
different branches that go imo mak
ing a complete system where thor
oughness, accuracy and speed are
important factors. Especially is this
so in all engineering trades necessary
to large manufacturing firms and
railroads.
Realizing the need of skilled crafts
men, th Grand Trunk railway es
tablished an"apprenticeship system"
in their motive power department,
and offers splendid inducements to
young men to become skilled crafts
men, and at their shops and round
houses have a capable instructor to
train them in the different trades
applied in the motive power depart
ment. The Grand Trunk railway has is
sued a little booklet on their "Ap
prenticeship System," which tells of
the work it is doing and the induce
ments offered young men. The fol
lowing is taken from this booklet:
"It may not be generally known
that the Motive Power Department
of the Grand Trunk Railway System
is the pioneer in the modern develop
ment of apprenticeship systems,
which are now part of the educa
tional features of all large railroads
in Noith America. guch, however,
is the case. From a small beginning,
about 16 years ago, in a few of the
main shops the system now in use
has spread out to include instruction
by a capable instructor at every
shop and roundhouse where three or
more apprentices are employed.
There are a few places where less
than that number are employed, but
arrangements are such that these
can be reached by correspondence
lessons and periodical visits by a
teacher, so that no apprentice work
ing for the Grand Trunk Railway in
the Motive Power Department is J
without the opportunity of improv
ing himself along lines best suited to
his advancement."
"Applicants for employment as
apprentices must be over 14 years
of age in Canada, over 16 in the
United States, and under 19 in both
case. If so desired, they may make
application by letter stating at which
point they would prefer to be em
ployed, their age, and how far ad
vanced when leaving school, also
present height and weight. Simply
address application to any officers
below, who will upon receipt of
same arrange for a personal inter
view, which is necessary in all cases.
The officers to be addressed . are:
Mr. A. A. Mayer, Master Mechan
ic, G. T. R. Works, Montreal, Que.
Mr. R. Patterson, Master Mechan
ic, G. T. R. Works, Stratford, Ont.
Mr. J. C. Garden, Master Mechan
ic, G. T. R. Works, Battle Creek,
Mich.
Mr. D. J. McCuaig, General Fore
man, G. T. R., Ottawa, Ont. '
Mr. E. R. Battley, General - Fore
man, G. T. R., Deering, Maine.
In addition to the above, applica
tions may be addressed to the fol
lowing: Mr. W. II. Sample, Master Mech
anic Eastern Lines, G. T. R., Mont
real, Que.
Mr. W. C. Sealy, Master Mechan
ic Ontario Lines, G. T. R., Toronto,
Ont.
Mr. B. J. Farr, Master Mechanic
Western Lines, G. T. R., Battle
Creek, Mich."
There is much overtime worked
and the company pays for this,
"time-and-a-half." Each extra hour
worked helps to bring nearer the
date of the nc-xt raise of pay, for as
! soon as the reqnired number of
, hours(2,860)have been worked, the
1 raise is due, and it is not necessary
, to wait a year.
The Grand Trunk Railway is thus
offering great inducements to young
men through its "apprenticeship
system," and the young men in this
section have it brought home to
them from the thorough and practi
cal work that ia .being done in the
BEAT HjSJOTHER
Fred Roby of Norton Sentenced
to Rutland for Beating His
Mother Gives the Officers
Quite a Scrap Before He Is
Subdued.
Fred Roby of Norton was arrested
Friday morning for breaking and
disturbing the peace and striking
his mother. Complaint was entered
to town grand juror A. J. Cameron
of Norton, and Roby was tried be
fore Judge Lund of Canaan, who
came .to Norton and held municipal
court Friday afternoon. Harry B.
Amey, attorney, took charge of the
prosecution for the town grand
juror. Roby plead guilty and was
sentenced to the workhouse at Rut
land for not less than five months
nor more than six months, and in
case the costs were not paid before
the expiration of his sentence, he is
to remain and work out the same at
the rate of 334 cents per day, which
will make him quite an extended
visit to this state institution, where
he was taken Monday by Sheriff
Richard Beattie. Roby had been the
guest of Deputy Sheriff E. A. Bemis
with quarters in the village lockup.
The officers had quite an exciting
time in capturing Roby. Early Fri
day morning Deputy Sheriff E. A.
Bemis was called to Norton by tele
phone, having a warrant for the ar
rest of Roby. Hevwent by auto and
took with him John Peterson, John
Cunnington, J. W. Carpenter, and
Lawrence Roby, father of the young
man, who was away at work in a
lumber camp, and hurried home on
a summons bv telephone telling of
the happenings at his home. The
party approached the Roby home
and three of them surrounded the
house while Deputy Sheriff Bemis
and Lawrence Roby entered the
building to arrast the lad. After a
careful search nothing was discover
ed of young Roby. He was found
at a neighbor's house lying on a bed,
and dressed except he had taken off
his coat. He resisted somewhat his
arrest but finally consented to go
with the officers if they would not
handcuff him. All went well until
he auto was reached which Roby re
fused to enter and while being per
suaded to get in he whirled and
struck officer Bemis in the face and
turned and jumped for a getaway.
His calculations failed for he jumped
into the arms of John Peterson, who
gripped and held him t like a vice.
Roby put up a stiff scrap and it
was some time before he was sub
dued and the irons placed upon him.
The party then started for the Roby
home, where the young man wanted
to get out and go in. The officer
would not allow this, but Roby
sprung another surprise on them by
jumping out of the auto and speed
ing away before the officer could
get a hand on him. Pursuit was
made but Roby led them a hot
chase down the highway, near the
station and across the fields. At
this stage of the pursuit station agent
Fred Young saw Roby running
across the fields and hastened down
the highway and intercepted him as
de jumped over the fence. A regu
lar old-fathioned wrestling bout fol
lowed with Young coming out best
man and holding Roby for the ar
rival of the officers. He was held
securely after this and taken to
court.

the municipal court held in the of
fice of State's Attorney Powell.

commended on the results thus far
obtained in clearing up the case and
punishing the principals connected
therewith.
HOLIDAY DECORATIONS
Merchants Have Pretty Window
Decorations' for the Holidays.
Island Pond merchants have e
celled in decorating their stores for
the holidays. The Christmas spirit
everywhere prevails and you almost
can :ee how glad Santa is to find
such a quantity of Christmas goods
awaiting, his coming. All the stores
are prettily arrayed but the most
noticeable are those having large
window displays.
The Bosworth Store is decorated
with an old-time brick fireplace.
Around it is shown the stockings and
toys which Santa has seemingly just
placed. As you view this pretty and
homelike scene, you seem to see
the fire gleaming as you remember
it in the days of long ago.
Stern Brothers have a unique
window display of a fountain. In
the center is a statue with electric
light. A large mirror is placed back
of it and the scone is fascinating
with the several streams from the
fountain rising and falling with the
beauty of a waterfall. Their color
ed electric light effect is .pleasing
and sets off the articles on display.
While the other stores are perhaps
not so elaborate in their decorations,
they are all decidedly charming.
Christmas trees laden with presents
are shown in the stores f O. T. Da
vis, Foss & Co., and S. J. Maroney.
The jewelry store of T. C. Carr,
dry goods s'ore of L. F. Jones, fruit
store or 11. M. fiancis, general
store of W. R. Boulds, the grocery
stores of W. J. Rooney and E. L.
Lanpher, the old reliaple drug
store of J. W. Thurston, are prettily
decorated with streamers, bells,
wreaths, flowers and attractive dis
plays of the articles they offer for
Christmas shoppers.
One seldom sees in a place of this
size more extensive Christmas decor
ations in places of business or better
taste and skill in their arrangements.
George Harlow of Burlington was
a guest of H. W. Gilman, proprietor
of the Stewart House, Thursday.
Miss Edna Finnegan is home from
her school in Portland for the Christ

Please Feed the Birds
The deep snow covers their food insects' eggs and larvae
and seeds of weeds and they will starve unless we feed them.
Give Them "Hayseed", chaff from the barjn floor, crumbs,
scraps of meat, bones and suet: anything eatable and they will
repay you a thousand fold by their work in the garden at'd or
chard next Spring. . (
Do It Now. Fasten the meat scraps and Miet securelv to
the trees and see how eagerly the chickadees and woodpeckers
go to it. Tread the snow down hard and scatter the h.iyseed
and crumbs there, or put the food on a board or box and watch
the juncos and tree sparrows fill up. Put out chaff and grain
for the quail and meadow-larks in the pasture. They work for
us all Summer long, eating insects.
Keep It Up While the Snow Lasts. It is not only a fine
philanthropy but a paying investment for each one of us. If you
