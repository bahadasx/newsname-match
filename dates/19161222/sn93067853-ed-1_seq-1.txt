"London, Dec. 19.?The announce- ^
nig&t in the fedtfee of commons today \
hy David Lloyd-Oedrpre, the ne# pre- .
mier, that the first act of his adminis- J
tration Vas the rejection of the pro- '
posal of the central powers for a I
peace conference constituted one of ^
1 f
w?o uiwv muiiieiiiuus scenes wmcn tne
oldest .parliamentary veterans had
ever witnessed.
, The' new premier declared thaff before
the allies could give favorable
consideration to such an invitation
'they must know that Germany was
prepared to "accede to the allies'
terms, giving complete restitution, full
reparation and effectual guarantees,"
and to enter a conference upon the
Invitation of Germany proclaiming
"herselv victorious, without any knowledge
of her proposals, woul^ be "put-,
ting our heads into a noose with the
end of the rope in Germany's hands."
Mr. Lfloyd-George asserted that at
the moment Germany was penning the
note, assuring her convictions as to
the rights of other nations, she was
dragging Belgians into slavery. He
announced that the note presented
through Washington contained no pro
vi ksiuis) uui nas n pnrapiiruse j
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl- j
weg's speech and that the allies, had j
separately concluded to reject it, al- j
though they had informally exchanged
-views and would within a few days *
t present a joint reply.
Others Support Him.
Mr. Asquith, the former premiet", _
? -seconded Mr. Lloyd-George's declara- .
* tion with even stronger words and al- <
most at the same moment Earl Cur- 7
son was informing the lord* that the
government would enter no confer- ?
enee that did npt guarantee for Eu^
~enee"i>?^i^iofis^' greaf^m^f' sm at!. The
Marquis of Crewe affirmed the approval'
of the jjiembers of the late
government. c
The day was a doubly important one c
for the commons because the new >
premier unfolded a program for wide
reaching war measures and Mr. As- s
quith closed the last chapter of nine
years of leadership with an accounting
of his war stewardship.
The principal feature of Mr. LloydGeorge's
program is a measure for 1
national service, matching Germany's 1
latest scheme, wherehv pver /?ifi*ori t
will he liable for enrollment to perform
work for which the authorities '
consider him best equipped. *
A?thur Neville Chamberlain, mavor
of Birmingham and ^ member of the
famous family, whose enerery and business
capacity are rated high, will he
director of the national service with *
civil and military drectors responsible *
to him. .
The premier prefaced his review 1
of the situation by the statement that 1
Britons did their'hest in time of dan- c
irer. that the country should be told J
unpleasant facts and that he would
trive not a dark but a stern view of 5
the outlook. j

U. S. DOING N|
TO I
Washington, Doc. 20.?Nothing
whatever is being done by the United
States toward suggesting a plan by
which the war in Europe may J3
ended. Nothing will be done unffl
the situation seems auspicious and
conditions ripe for the acceptance IM
suggestion by the opposing belligem
ints. ' i
President Wilson today made thm
fact plain to callers. He expressed
the opinion that discussion of thi
jituation and conditions prevailing
jetween the rival forces must be lit
ritating to them and celculate^'lj)
ndicate a desire for meddling. For
Jiat reason he thought &at nothing
>fficially should be aaidfijg the sulj?
ect. He made it clear pBjb-the CMN
nan peace proposal wai transmitted
without comment or proffer of good
iffices simply because* such action
night be construed in some quarters
is officious.
Await Word from Page.

idvices had been received from Amf
>assador Page at London inform^H
he state department that the pewr
iroposal had been delivered to ^Bjj
British foreign office and forward*
0 ottnr interested nations. UnofficUil
nformation was to the effect that tiI
lote had reached Ambassador Pag#
ind been delivered according to ink
itructions. It was strongly hoped thm
he proposals would i*ach Engttiff
itatesmen in time for study and anMp
sis before the premie*; David ifojl
George, delivered his address to plX
iament, presumably tomorrow. f9.
Teutonic circles were busy to<]UB
iiscussing^the possibility that tA
Dutch government may find an
lortunity in the immediate future 11
nvite the warring nationa to attend
1 mediation conference at The Hagiip.
The opinion was expressed that 9
iolland or any other nation not ifc

his character, all other neutrals, ad|
(specially those adjacent to the zona
>f strife, promptly'would approve it. 1
Allied Propaganda. ?,? |
Although the German "propaJf
randa" is s^id to have been tnjusug
illy active in placing the Teufionjl
dew of the. peace proposal befordfittjfi
tlStfiWl atopl| p\d
Wuntnes^uiato^rfiie allies has beert1
jasily discernible. It is self-evident
hat both sides are striving to cap;ure
public sentiment to the utmost
legree. Such efforts are extended to
ill neutral countries. This is mani'est
in despatches from Entente capi,als
and those of the central powers.
One of the latest examples of the
illied "propaganda" is noticed in the
suggestion that President Wilson and
lis advisers omitted all comment or
suggestion in transmitting the peace
proposal to the allies because they
lid not regard it as deserving of
nuch consideration.
This view is contradicted by every
statement made by high Administra;ion
officials since Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg announced the
leace proposal.. It was pointed out
:oday, in this connection, that "the
iresident followed the only consistent
ourse possible in the circumstances.
The pursuance of any other method
vould have made the United States
ippear ridiculous and might have
irejudiced any future efforts.
Balfour's Vacation.
In German Embassy circles there
vas evidenced a feeling of relief over
he unofficial report from London
hat the formal peace offer had been
landed to Lord Robert Cecil, acting
or Foreign Secretary Balfour. The
itatement that Mr. Balfour had berun
a three weeks' vacation naturally
jrovoked discussion. Strong hints
vere given in diplomatic quarters that
jossibly he may have gone to he
rontinent for conferences with Prenier
Briand and other allied officials
oncerning the course to be followed
>y the entente.
Those responsible for the Teutonic
viewpoint expressed the conviction
oday, as heretofore, that the allies
vill not abruptly reject the peace
iroposal. They confidently believe it
eivc earnest consideration and
,hat some reply will be made conlistent
with the momentous nature of
he communication.
A high authority in close touch with
he viewpoint of the Teutonic powers
'eels absolutely convince^ that proper
guarantees can be given in a conference
for the arrangement of peace?
'or the opening of the Dardanelles and
he Bosporous to the commerce of the
vorld after the consummation of a
eal and lasting peace between the
varring nations of Europe.
This, it is argued, can be accomilished
without the loss of an addiional
allied soldier, or the expendiure
of further treasuries. It would
ome automatically, like the return
?f conquered territory in Belgium and
ranee.
The opening of the Dardanelles
vould enable Russia to realize a
Iream generations old. The result
vould be to give that great wheat>roducing
empire a highway to the
eat at all seasons of the year.
An announcement was made by the
I
>THING j
END THE WAR
|
new Russian premier, Trepoff, imme- =
diately upon the assumption of office, ?
that Russia must have Constantinople.
At the same time he informed the
Russian people and the world that the R
allies already had entered into a solemn
agreement whereby the Turkish
capital would be turned over to Russia.
This declaration was enunciated be- _
fore Field Marshal von Mackensen 1
and Gen. von Falkenhayn had rolled ^
back the Rumanian army and cap- " !
tured'all of the Wallachian plain. ?,
Since then nothing has been said by '
Premier Trepoff concerning the possession
of Constantinople. The com- 11
bined German, Austrian, Bulgarian
jand Turkish army, closed the door ^
through which Russia's legions were '
to march on the converted city.
Russia's ODnortunitv.
Russia may now satisfy her ambi- 2?!
tion, according to the authority indicated
to the extent of freely using the nf
Bosporous, the Sea of Marmora and
the Dardanelles without losing mil- 1
lions of men and wasting billions of
treasure. Her allies can have the same "
privilege by aj-ranging peace at this r
time on reasonable and just terms.
The Dardanelles and the Bosporous, se
according to this authority, have
been strongly fortified until this time
by the Turks because they appre- ,
hended attack, and for no other reason.
With a binding peace agree- so
ment, supplemented by at least partial
disarmament, and a world-wide
association of nations to enforce jj,
peace, there no longer would be real
clanger of attack.
Neither would there be any good
reason why Turkey should maintain
strong defensive armament on both ^
sides of the Dardanelles. This would |n
be a practical illustration of disarmament,
according to the German au- 0[]
thority. It would be immediately appreciated
by the entire world, but ,ir
more especially by the allied nations jj.
which, with Russia, are fighting
among other things for an opportunity
to utilize the Dardanelles. ^
Great Britain and France made a ^
1 determined effort to open the Dar- cr
danelles on orders issued by Winston
Spencer Churchill when he was First Gl
ljord of the British Admiralty. The
.Aterapt failed. Many celebrated gen1
tfrals then were sent to the Dardantlles
to cooperate with the eflet. Approximately
:i00,000 allied troops were
reported in that vicinity. The loss to
the allies' land forces was placed at
more than 100,000 men, and again
they failed to open the Dardanelles. ne
They they were withdrawn from Gal- j)a
lipoli. n
Allies Blocked.
Presumably as a last step in the direction
of capturing Constantinople,
the allied troops were landed on neu- yC
tral Greek soil at Salonica. More than *
a year has elapsed and no progress cr
in the direction of achievement has
been made. With a great army of y
Germans, Bulgarians and Turks y.
massed against him, Gen. Sarrall is j/j
held fast, while Russia no longer can j (
expect to force her way through the ^
Balkans. ^
The right of Turkey to hold the
Dardanelles has been disputed for qj
centuries. But a few years have gone ^
by since all the Balkan nations, in- y(
eluding Bulgaria, sought to drive the y:
Turks permanently from Europe. Despite
these efforts Constantinople re- ST
mains in Turkish hands. The fortifications
of the city are stronger by
far than ever before and seemingly jn
capable of withdrawing all the pressure
which the armies and navies of
great European nations can exert
against them.
All this turmoil and strife may be
ended, according to the German au- st<
ik *. - 1 ?
wiorivy wno oeueves dismantling of at
the fortifications along the Darda- th
nelles can be arranged. A peace th
agreement with definite guarantees be- R<
hind it, he contends, would accom- op
plish that result. pr

1Y FOR UN/ON
romoters of New Enterprise
Are Union Men Who Wilt
Own and Operate Company?
If Franchise is Granted by
City Council Work Will Begin
at Once.
Messrs. E. F. Kelly, B. F .Kennedy
id other local men have applied to
le city council for a franchise to
jild and operate a street railway for
nion. The plans have been so far
.rrier out that the system will be
lilt provided the franchise is granted
' the city.
The proposed railway system is to
ver the city of Union, connecting
onarch and South Union, from the
st and later is to be built to Iluflo.
Under the proposed franchise
Drk upon the roadway must be begun
' Anril 1 1017 ; * 1
- - J -, -. * , C*.I\1 vvj ill ul'lUUl
ieration by January 1, 1918. The
e of the proposed franchise is to
st 50 years, and the franchise prodes
the usual safeguards for the city
well as for the proposed corporam,
the usual form, except that the
esent proposal is more liberal in iLipulations
guarding the public and
e city than is usually to be found
such documents.
The proposed corporators have statemphaticallv
that they are not
omoting this enterprise with the <?h?t
of selling to Other parties but they
opose to operate and control it
emselves. t)n two previous occa5ns
the city father have granted
anchises for street railways and un >n
vestigation, we find that both co ninies
were granted many privileges
at were not even asked for in the
esent franchise. We have read the
oposed franchise from beginning to
d and find absolutely nothing that
not fair and reasonable both to the
;izens of Union and also to the corrators.
In our judgment this is an oppornity
for the city fathers to do someing
for the upbuilding of Union that
really worth while.
We have interviewed two of the
rties interested in the establishment
this enterprise and they assure iia
at this is no "hot air" proposition,
d if the franchise is granted the
ad will be built, and they expect to
cure power from the Municipal Electa
Plant to operate cars.
