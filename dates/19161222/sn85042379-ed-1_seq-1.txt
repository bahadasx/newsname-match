LOCAL TEAM
DEFEATS MALTA
First Basketball Game of Season
Won by Local
Boys
Malta was "easy pickings" for the
Glasgow basketball team Thursday
night.
It being the first game of the sea
son, both teams were confident before
the contest started, but before it had
gone very far, the Malta athletes saw
that they were hopelessly outclassed.
Neither team had devoted much
time to practice and the playing did
not show the team-work that may bo
during mid-season.
Owing to the lateness of the train
on which the Malta players arrived,
the game did not start until 10:45,
and many of those who had come to
son, but their hopes were short lived,
for when the whistle blew calling the
end of the game, the score was 66
to ., 2 in favor of Glasgow.
Only three men of the first team
played all through the came t": Glas
gow, these being Illnrinn. Richardson
witness the contest left before the
game started.
The Malta team had come down
here with on§ victory this season to
their credit, and they thought they
could redeem their defeat of last sea
and l.ebert. Wall, the star center,
was called away before the game be

penger is quarantined with smallpox.
Five men of the second team were
broken in and all showed up to good
advantage. Billy Illman was the star

pect to bring back the scalps of both
teams. They play Culbertson on
Thursday, December 8th, and Willis

of the game scoring almost one-half
of the total points. Lebert and Rich
ardson were also strong factors in
Glasgow's victory. Heiland had a
night off and did not make his usual
number of points.
For Malta Ballard, Robinson, Ruf
tin and Partridge starred.

day's game follows:

BILLIARD HALL ALMOST READY
The new Crescent Billiard Parlors
and Bowling Alleys are almost ready,
and sometime next week they will be
opened to the public.

SHORTER HOURS

The local druggists have struck for
shorter hours. They claim they are

business in less time if it is properly

640 ACRE BILL MAY
CONTAIN MANY CHANGES
Washington, Dec. 13.—The confer- !
ence committee in charge of the H40
acre grazing homestead bill has
reached a partial agreement, striking
out most of the senate amendments,
There is a disposition in the commit
tee, however, to strike out other fea
t.ures which had been accepted by
both senate and house, the additional
changes being demanded by the con
servationists. On this feature there
may be a fight which may prevent
any final action this season.
One provision attacked is that
which allows preferential entries to
be made in advance of the elassifica
tion of lands. The other permits set
tiers who have exhausted their home
I stead rights to buy lands adjoining'
I their holdings up to the maximum of
1 040 acres at $1.25 per acre. The con
! servationists say these provisions
must be eliminated or they will defeat
'the measure.
STOCK QUARANTINE LIFTED
The quarantine which was made ef
fective November 27th by Gov. Stc
wart against the importation into
Montana of cattle, sheep, swine and
j
other ruminants from Nebraska, Mis
souri, and Kansas and prohibiting the
shipment into Montana of any of the
animals named from public stock
yards east of Montana, has been re
voked by acting Governor Burling
ame. The order was revoked on the
recommendation of the state live
stock sanitary board.
Livestock may now enter Montana
from any state in the union if ac
companied by a certificate of health
in accordance with the requirements
of the laws of Montana and the reg
ulations of the livestock sanitary
board.
OFFICES TO CHANGE IX)CATION
When the Rundle building is com
pleted and ready for occupancy the
city offices, which now occupy the,
building next to the Courier, will prob- ;
ably be moved to the second floor of
the Rundle building. The new Farm- !
ers-Stockgrowers Bank will then take
the building vacated by the city offi
ces and will use it temporarily.
The city offices will occupy two
large rooms opposite the vault, to
which they will have access for the
storage of the records and books. The
city council have not acted definitely
yet on the matter but the new loca
tion will have so many advantages
over the present, that it is thought
that the change will be made.
SENDING OUT LOAN BLANKS

Miller, is sending out application
blanks to farmers of the state seeking

Limit
Check artists in Valley county will

^ <H some little time. County Attor
ney Borton has had so many com
plaints of worthless checks being
passed since he came into office that
he decided the only method to pursue
to stop the wave, was to put his foot

640 ACRE BILL
TO BE LAW SOON
Measure Passes Both Senate and
House With Few Changes
WILL BENEFIT THE STATE
Thousands of Acres in Montana Will
Be Affected by New Law. Many
Settlers to Take Up Land
The Ferris Bill to provide 640 acre
homesteads principally for grazing
purposes, has passed both houses of
congress and has gone to the Presi
dent for his signature. All the dis
puted points were smoothed out in
conferences between the house and
senate.
The bill has been supported by the
interior department and western con
gressmen as a measure for further
opening the public domain.
Many millions of acres of non-agri
cultural, non-mineral, non-irrigable
land will be opened to stock raising
homestead settlement under the bill
and it is regarded as one of the most
important affecting the public domain
passed in many years. It will prob
ably become a law very shortly, ac
cording to the conferees.
Under the new bill, lands will be
open to any one upon entry and three
years' residence and improvement
without any money payment what
ever, except ordinary filing fees.
Representative Ferris, author of the
measure, predicted 10,000 persons are
likely to go from each of a number
Î of middle western states to take up
homesteads.
I ^ section to which administration
1 officials objected, authorizing those al
! ready holding homesteads to purchase
j.
no ^ exceeding 320 acres of contiguous
j stock raising land at $1.25 an acre,
was stricken out in order to prevent
! speculation.
j provisions of the bill before
it was changed follows:

AUTO UPSETS
l>ast week the Jensen Bros, and
Mr. and Mrs. Flickinger were going
, to Genora, N. I)., in their Ford ear
land near Opheim had a peculiar ac
j cident says the Thoeny Review. Their
, ear upset and turned bottom side up,
! resting on the top. The top support
| ed the ear in mid-air so the occu
pants made their exit from the side
j as handy as if nothing had happened.
When they got out they were sur-,
| prised to see the engine going and
the wheels spinning. It is reported
that the car was placed right side up
j without stopping the engine and when
j the wheels hit the ground it started
away. One of the Jensens jumped
on the side and succeeded in shutting
the thing off and making it behave
until the balance of the party got
aboard. No doubt the car wanted to
do the nuile stunt and take a roll in
the grass.
