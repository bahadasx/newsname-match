IKE EUROPEAN WAR
Peace Consideration Held Doubt
, fuL Roumanians Still Run
ning. French Gain.
", The great speech by the new
Premier of England disclosed
principally what had been fore
cast and the slogan "Get on
with the war" was coined from
his utterances. The answer to
Germany's proposal to enter into
peace negotiations is that the
cerral powers first agree to do
all that the allies will demand.
' So far as England is concerned,
ah would have the ritrht to de
mand reparation by the Central
powers only in the event of hav
ing been first assaulted, and fin
ntlf hv beine victorious. War
-was declared on Russia and
France after what was consider
ed due provocation following the
assassination ol an Ausindu
Archduke and Archduchess.
;, Those in charge of Englands
affaire deem it necessary to first
nlaeate Ireland then raise more
money and men and then "Get
on with the war," according to
Mnvd-Georze. French made
drive near Verdun and drove her

front and the German Armv con

bottling the'navy, battling over
the Dardanelles, failure to pro

Italy, rushing Roumania to her
iuick destruction, coercing
Greece and finally disdaining the
offer fey her heretofore victorious
enemy to talk peace, are matters
"Rncrliah leaders are much troub

tnisirivings and neutrals with
distrust.
