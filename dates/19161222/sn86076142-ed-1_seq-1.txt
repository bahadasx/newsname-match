Words Fail to Express the Shock Caused By Wilson's Message
Three Million Shares Sold
By Wall Street Operators
(Br Associated Press.)
NEW YORK, Dec. 22. Tlio stock
market yeHterday went through Hie
most exciting day In lta history, with
one exception. President Wilson's
note to the belligerent powers, fol
lowed by Secretary Lansing's first
explanatory statement of Its Intent,
were tbe occasion of frenzied selling,
which In scope and value fairly
dwarfed all the operations which fol
lowed on the peace proposals from
Germany.
Prices were slaughtered to the ex
tent of Ave, ten and fifteen points,
and In one case 33, and the day's
sales amounted to 3,176,000 shares,
a total without precedent since the
famous Northwestern Pacific 'corner
of 1901.
The liquidation of the forenoon,
amounting to more than 1,300,000
shares alone, was confined, as had
been the case in the recent opera
tions, to the so-called "war brides,"
or stocks which might be adversely
affected by the declaration of peace,
but soon after the publieatIon-f
Secretary Lansing's statement," sug
gesting that the United States was
"drawing nearer to the verge of war,"
rails also began to participate in the
decline, selling off sharply, with
losses of from 4 to 8 points before
the close.
Brokers' offices long before the
opening were loaded with selling or
ders, and when the gong on the floor
of the exchange Bounded for tbe
trading to begin, there was a scene
of excitement such as even veteran
traders had not witnessed In many
years. Brokers surged around the
piyts of the popular speculative
stocks, and opening offers were so
wide apart that sales of one or two
points difference occurred simultaneously.
BRITAIN STARTLED 8Y
NOTE OF PRES. WILSGN
( Br AHMlalti Press.
LONDON, Dec. 22. Absolute and
startling surprise was the first feel
ing in Great Britain aroused by
President Wilson's note. The gov
ernment was surprised, and frankly
admitted so. The members of parlia
ment were equally surprised when
the news spread through both houses
during the afternoon session.
The newspaper offices were sur
prised and undoubtedly the public
was equally surprised when they read
Ambassador Page's statement to the
foreign office in the morning papers.
All Information from America, in
the last few days, both in dispatches
from the usually best informed Wash
ington correspondents and in advices
to the banking and business firms,
has said that the president had no
intention of taking any steps towards
peace or making any move in Euro
pean affairs.
When he transmitted Germany's
note to Great Britain, without com
ment, it was assumed that this ac
tion represented his general attitude
towards the European situation.
LONDON SURPRISED

The first transactions recorded by

from two to seven points. United

front throughout the day, first ap
peared on the tape, with a transac
tion of 50,000,' representing a lump
ing together of numerous selling or
ders at 104 to 106, but creating
a tremendous sensation. The trading
from then on was furious, and the
excitement throughout the street in
tense. The brokers' offices were
thronged with nervous customers,
many of whom had to see their
accounts sold out for lack of margins.
The private wires were choked with
selling orders, from all parts of the
country, particularly during the after
noon. The ticker noon fell far behind
In recording the sales, and no one
knew at any given moment what the
market actually was on the floor of
the exchange.

seeks in order that it might regulate

Secretary Lansing's final statement.
formally prepared, and Issued after
he had been called to the White
House for a conference with Presi
dent Wilson, , declared that he had
not intended to intimate that the
United States was considering any
change in is policy of neutrality and
that the whole tone and language of
the note were sufficient to indicate
its purpose without further comment
on his part.
Mr. Lansing's first statement, made
orally and of which no official copy
was distributed, led to exaggerations
of its language and purpose through
out official Washington. Its most
striking phrases on which the widest
speculation was based were the
United States was "drawing nearer
the verge of war," and that the send
ing of the note "will Indicate the
possibility of our being forced into
the war," and that neither he nor
President 'Wilson regarded the note
as a peace note."
When word of what the secretary
of state had said spread throughout
the capital it created the greatest
consternation in official circles and
among the foreign diplomats, many
of whom were calling at the state de
partment to receive their copies of
the note dispatched to their capitals.
It became apparent that the secre
tary's statement was not fully ap
proved at the White House and that
there was question as to the wisdom
of making any comment that might
be regarded as an addition to the
note. The White House was con
cerned lest any word reach the for
eign capitals to be construed as indi
cating that the American note was
anything but what it indicated on its
face. So, after a conference between
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing, the second statement was form
ally prepared and distributed at the
state department.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22. Diplo
mats are watching whether European
neutrals will follow the lead of the

appeal to the belligerents. There Is
a growing feeling that the United
States hopes to become a clearing
house for the views and possibly the
terms of belligerents.
Spanish and Swiss representatives
who have been at the state depart
ment repeatedly probably known fully
the plans of the government. Every
effort Is being mads by Lansing to
prove ths notes ars hot a pro-German
move. It is indicated that the en
tente diplomats understand ths sltua
tlon and will advise their govern
, menta to reply In a friendly spirit.
