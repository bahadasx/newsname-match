Thomas and Wood Saw Their
Way to Liberty Helped
by Outsiders
Private Thomas Campbell of
Company B First Arizona In
fantry who was called home last
Thursday on account of the ser
ious illness of his wife received
a telegram from Colonel Tuthill
commanding First Arizona In
fantry to arrest two deserters
from Company B Ansel Thomas
and a man named Wood
Private Campbell arrested
Thomas Saturday and locked him
up in the trustys cell at the
county jail Monday he arrested
Wood and placed him in the cell
with Thomas and wired Colonel
Tuthill that he had arrested both
men and was waiting for orders
A guard was to come here
from Naco and take both men
back to camp
Sometime early Wednesday
morning Thomas and Wood made
good their escape from jail bv
sawing the lower steel plate en
closing the bars of the cell door
and bent back the bars to allow
them to pass through and into
the corridor
The padlock on the outside of
the cell door was broken off
showing that the men were as
sisted in their escape from jail
Evidently those who helped
the deserters to break jail broke
off the padlock of the first door
and swung it open then passed
a hack saw to the men who
sawed the steel plate allowing
the bars lo be bent back sufficient
for them to crawl through
Private Campbell wired Col
onel Tuthill that Thomas and
Wood had broke jail and were at
liberty and undoubtedly the mili
tary authorities will take up the
J search for the men

Rebekah Fair
a Great Success
Saturday night closed a most
successful fair conducted by the
Daughters of Rebekah at the
Safford Armory The Safford
orchestra rendered excellent mu
sic during the evening- and the
dance was well patronized Dur
ing the evening the different
articles were raffled and much
interest was evidenced as this
fair was the first of its kind ever
attempted in Safford Among
the lucky winners of the differ
ent articles were Mitt Sims State
treasurer who picked the lucky
number for the garnet ring
Charles Norton won the rock
ing chair donated by the Solo
mon Commercial store Frank
Dempsey picked the lucky num
ber for the gold knife donated
by the Safford Jewelry Company
and Will Freeman carried home
the two boxes of cigars donated
by John F Weber
A beautiful manicure set was
drawn by F L Ginter the blue
bird lunch set was won by Miss
Effie Main and R Crandall made
all the ladies envious by appro
priating the beautiful corset
cover
To clap the climax E W Clay
ton drew the lucky number for
the very much coveted doll and
no doubt Mr Clayton will be
very popular among the young
sters for awhile each bent on
gaining the heart of the said
gentleman and eventually the
big doll
The fair was a financial suc
cess and great credit is due the
ladies who furthered its success
It is hoped that Safford will not
have to wait so many years
again before this form of amuse
ment is repeated

Wednesday
FINE PROGRAM EACH BAY
Miss McNulty of Tempe Nor
mal Gives a Fine Talk on
Primary Reading
The County Teachers Institute
of Graham County was called to
order Wednesday morning by
S C Heywood county superin
tendent
MissS Jeanette Dupuis gave a
reading followed by invocation
by Rev Gillette
Prof D M Hibner delivered
the address of welcome
The addresses of the morning
were given by Dr -E A Winship
of Boston and Miss McNulty of
the Tempe Normal
Dr Winship took up the sub
ject of Great things that are
actually being done in rural
schools today He said The
rural schools of a community
should be considered as including
all children under eighteen years
of age which would treble the
school attendance in most dis
tricts
He gave several illustrations of
school districts that had been
revolutionized by making the
education more practical and
giving the boys and girls train
ing for which they might have
immediate use
Dr Winship cited instances in
which schools had been placed
on a self supporting basis and the
earning capacity of each individual-pupil
inc sased
He that
boys and girls like responsibility
and if all the young people in the
community were enlisted in all
games and contests as a vital
part of the school that school dis
trict would be entirely trans
formed
He also recommended inter
esting the parents by giving them
an active part in the social life
and making the school the social
center
Miss McNulty of the Tempe
Normal gave a very instructive
talk on Primary Reading
She explained the Beacon
Chart but pointed out some of
its weak points and lack of rela
tion to the Beacon reader She
said that no one system seemed
adapted to all requirements but
must be wisely culled by the
teacher to suit her particular
needs She advised encouraging
rapid reading as an aid to thought
getting rather than placing too
much emphasis on phonetics
which in many instances dwarfs
the ability to get the thought as
well as detracting from the pleas
ure to be derived therefrom
The afternoon session was
opened bv a reading by Miss Lu
anna Stewart of Bryce followed
by an able address by Dr Win
ship His theme was Informa
tion versus Intelligence He
showed the utter folly of making
information the only incentive in
education and brought out most
forcibly that greater asset in ed
ucation intelligence both on
the part of the teacher in selec
tion of material to be given and
in recognizing true intelligence
in his pupils
After pointing out the futility
of giving pupils long lists of
facts which would soon be for
gotten or perhaps never used if
remembered he advised direct
ing the intelligent boy and girl
to the sources of knowledge and
showing them how to secure these
for themselves when needed
He said further Teach them
to go to authorities for their in
formation whether books or persons-
nine out of every ten peo
ple ask for information from any
one rather than the person whose
business it is to know
He pointed out the necessity of
obtaining the latest information
and the lack of giving this on
the part of many instructors
For instance the machinery used
in many manual training depart
ments has been discarded years
ago by up-to-date manufacturers
Miss McNulty a talk on Pri
mary Arithmetic was very in
structive to the teacher of the
lower grades She told of tlie
practical side of the work being
done in the Tempo Normal Be

S AFFORD GRAHAM COUNTY ARIZONA DECEMBER 22 1916
After Many Years CONVICT IS KILLED
Fate Is So Kind
Fate is so kind to some people
and to a few it seems kinder
But everything comes to him who
waits though it may be years
before he gets it
The particular object of a happy
fate was discovered Monday
morning when the friends of
Ernest William Clayton the
popular cashier of the Bank of
Safford noticed that he was par
ticularly happy Not that the
amiable cashier is not always in a
happy mood but on this occasion
his beaming face and very plea
sant way of greeting his friends
caused them to stop and wonder
wjiat was really up
They were not left long in
doubt however as one of his
really close friends noting the
joy that was beaming in his
countenance could contain him
self no longer and insisted on
knowing the source of his happi
ness
Its a girl and it happened
Saturday night about 1030
oclock answered the happy
daddy and the secret was out
Well what do you know about
that said the friend as he
shook the hands of the happy
daddy and congratulated him -
We were fortunate in getting a
peep at the new arrival and she
certainly is a beaut Large blue
eyes just like her daddy and
beautiful brown hair just like
her daddy and we were reminded
of a little ditty that baby may be
singing in a few months from
now It goes something like this
Daddy wouldnt buy me a bow wow
Daddy wouldnt buy me a bow wow

But I do not care for that
I want a little bow-wow-wow

While Attempting to Escape
from Prison Camp Near
Solomonville
Three convicts at the State
Camp above Solomonville tried
to make their escape about 130
oclock yesterday morning with
the result that one was killed
one wounded and the third one
got back in his tent before the of
ficers could discover his identity
According to the story at the
coroners inquest when the
guards discovered the three men
running to the fence they called
on them to halt They continued
on and were in the act of climb
ing over the fence when the
guards fired Two men fell to
the ground and the third ran
back into camp
When the guards reached the
fallen men they found one dead
and the other wounded The
guards recognized the dead man
as No 4848 Jesus Rodriguez
and the wounded man was No
4762 Miguel Ramirez
Doctors Stratton and McWhirt
were summoned from Safford
When the doctors reached the
camp they found on examina
tion that Rodriguez was shot in
the back and that a buck shot
had penetrated the heart causing
his death
Ramirez was only slightly
wounded one shot struck back
of the left ear and another one
entered the left shoulder
The verdict of the coroners
jury was that Rodriguez came to
his death as the result of a gun
shot wound while attempting to
escape

WILSON APPEALS
TO BELLIGERENTS
For Avowal of Views in
Regard to Terms to Con
clude the War
SEEKS PEACE FOR THE WORLD
President Hopes That the War
ring Nations May Soon
End Strife
President Wilson has appealed
to all the belligerents to discuss
terms of peace
Without actually proposing
peace or offering mediation the
president has sent formal notes
to the governments of all the
warring nations suggesting that
an early occasion be sought to
call out from the nations now at
war such an avowal of their re
spective views as to the terms
upon which the war may be con
cluded and the arrangements
which would be deemed satis
factory as a guaranty against its
renewal or the kindling of any
similar conflict in the future as
would make it possible frankly
to compare them
Wholly without notice and en
tirely contrary to what adminis
tration officials have described
as his course Tuesday night the
president dispatched the notes to
all the belligerents and to all
the neutrals for their informa
tion SummarizPfl in flin nroci
dent s own words as contained
in tne notes his attitude is as
follows
The president is not propos
ing peace he is not even offering
mediation He is merolv nmnns
ing that soundings be taken in
oraer - tnat we may learn the
neutral nations with tha
Ferent hov near theTiavenof
peace may be tor which all man
kind longs with an intense and
increasing longing He believes
that the spirit in which he speaks
and the objects which he seeks
will be understood by all con
cerned and he confidently hopes
for a response which will bring a
new light into the affairs of the
world
