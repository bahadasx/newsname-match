ifflNÜs WORTHY OF
NOI'EiN NEW MEXICO
It is worthy of note that there
is no state poor house In Now
Mexico and tho need of ono has
not been yet manifest, although
there are charitable institutions
under private control whicn care
for the indigent sick, and the
state contributes to tho support
of such institutions as well as to
the support of several orphan
asylums that aro conducted by
charitable organizations.
The stale institutions, semi-
charitable, insane asylums;
Wis for the donf and dumb
and the blind are ull well provid
e:l for and the laid apprpria
uons made tor their maintenance
assist materially in reducing
taxation.
Tho court records of New
Mexico show a percentage of
crime below the average of many
older states, giving evidence of
the class of citizenship and the
extent to which the laws arc
enforced.
New Mexico offers a nicohome
land; a healthful climate, delight
ful at all seasons or the year,
with the door of opportunity open
to all that are able and willing
to strain his energy.
Now Mexico is thoroughly a
new nnd wide field to use uny
kind of intellectual faculties pro
vided they may be exercised with
good judgement; because hero
and everywhere else, there must
bo intelligent effort honestly di
rected, without which no man
can mako a success of any under
taking in life.

HfKPITAI QIIPPITliV:
A MINI, pKLT WAN
Idea of Dr. R. T. Lucas Pop
ular One When He Plan
ned Real Hospital for Car-
rirozo.
MODEL INSTITUTION SOON TO
BE READY FOR OCCUPANCY
About January 1st, or very soon
thereafter, will witness the
formal opening of Cnrrizozo's first
real hospital and the pcoplo of
this section of the country wil
have come to a realization of a
long fell need- a hospital; a place
neto tnooo infirm of ujtiy can
uu jji'jpeny cured tor, a.id at a
moderate item of expense.
Heretofore the people of the
rural districts have found it very
inconvenient in instances of ser
ious illness or confinement cases,
especially when patients need the
constant services of a physician,
and have often been denied such
aorvices on account of mo dis
tance they resided from town,
and other incoiiaistieiieíes. The
completion of the Dr. Lucas hos
pital will solve or in fact, has
solved this problem. Patients!
can be brought to town for medi
cal treatment, thus enhancing
their chances of recovery and at1
the same tune lessening the cost
ana aiieviuting possible unncces-
-i., atiiiering. Every arrangn
. to tune care of patients nas
bv . made, nothing in this con
ncction has been overlooked.
M-3!s will be served to patients
and comfortable rooms supplied
them, thus doing away with the
necessity of stopping at local
hotels while under treatment,
which hns in many cases been
founu wiicliy unsatisfactory for
divers reasons, notwithstanding
this hns long been the only resort.
The new hospital was planned
and built by Dr. R. T. Lucas with
tho nucleal idea of specializing in
the practice of obstetrics of which
particular line the doctor has
made a specialty in his daily prac
tice for several years. Every con
venience is provided for tho ex
pectant mother and every bit of
equipment is of tho latest and
approved type. There are several
patients' private rooms, specially
arranged for convenience and
comfort, bath room, dispensary
and operating room in tho rear.
Arrangements will be complet
ed whereby a professional nurse
will be secured nnd patients will
be cared for and accorded the
samo export treatment obtain
able in the large city institutions.
The old methods nro rapidly be
ing brushed aside and the modern
are brought upon us. Cnrrizozo
has long felt the need of such an
institution and should feel justly
proud of this now model uddition.
It is especially a boon to farmers
and ranchmen -the rural con
tingent as a whole and under
the careful management and di
rcction of Dr. Lucas, a man whrt
has had years of successful prac
tice in the art of medicine and
surgery, is bound to prove nil ita
promoter hopes for it.
