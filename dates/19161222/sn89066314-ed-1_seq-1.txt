Germany.
By United Tress
WASHINGTON'. Dec. 22. Washing
ton is recovering slowly from yester
day's history-making developments.
Washington officials are now looking
to the foreign officers of the belliger
ent nations for the next peace move.
As outlined in the early reports, ex
ception was at first taken to Presi
dent Wilson's overtures In both Eng
lish and Canadian demands. This
outspoken exception Is today seeming
ly being toned down. The adminis
tration feels, however, that this feeling
Is not sufficient to cast any real gloom
on the situation.
"o Flat Refusal Expected.
By United rress
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22. For the
same reason that Great Britain and
her allies did not flatly reject the
peace proposals of the Teutonic pow
ers, they will not flatlyturn down the
suggestions for peace offered by
President Wilson In his message yes
terday, was the belief in diplomatic
circles this afternoon.
This opinion was voiced to a Unit
ed Press Correspondent in an inti
mate and confidential talk today with
the French and British embassies in
Washington. At these embassies two
reasons were given for this opinion:
By flatly refusing the President's re
quest for speclflic terms would be
playing directly into German hands
since Germany would then have an
opportunity to reiterate her oft-repeated
statement that the entente allies
are responsible for the prolonging of
the. war. Such a turn-down would
then tend to weaken the sympathy for
the cause of the allies in the United
States.
German Peace Terms Soon.
By United Press
THE HAGUE, Dec. 22. Germany
will declare her definite peace terms
Immediately If the coming return note
from the entente allies in reply to von
Bertmann-Hollweg'a peace proposals
leaves the peace door open, German
dispatches state it was seml-offlcially
announced today.
Klnp George Against Peace Offer.
Ry United Press
LONDON, Dec. 22. Proroguing
Parliament today until February 7,
King George added the weight of his
word to the allies' stern rejection of
a German made peace. "The vigorous
prosecution of the war must be our
single endeavor," his majesty said,
"until we have vldlcated the rights so
ruthlessly violated "by our enemies,"
Concerned About Effect on Market
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec 22. A resolu

conflicting interpretations placed upon

SUBSCRIPTION RATES
In common with practically all
other newspapers of the country,
it will be necessary for the Mls
sourlan to increase its subscrip
tion rates after January 1, 1917.
The prices for the paper after
January l may be found In anoth
er part of this issue of the paper.
This Increase In rates Is due to
a general increase in the cost of
materials used in publishing, the
chief of which is white paper.
Present prices for white print pa
per in Columbia is $6.70 a hun
dred pounds. About six months
ago the price for a much better
grade of paper was $2.30 a hun
dred. The Federal Trade Commission
held a hearing at Washington last
week In an endeavor to relieve
the situation that is forcing many
publications out of business. H.
J. Blanton of Paris, Mo., owner
of the Paris Appeal and William
Southern, Jr., of the Indepen
dent Examiner appeared before
the Commission as the repre
sentatives of the newspapers of
Missouri.
The Federal Trade Commission
is now working on a plan where
by the government may take over
the distribution of print paper to
insure the publishers of the small
er dailies and weeklies getting an
even chance on the market with
metropolitan newspapers.
The investigation in Washing
ton last week brought out the
facts that the tremendous In
crease in cost of print paper is
due partly to a shortage of chemi
cals used in manufacturing wood
pulp, the closing down of foreign
pulp mills and the further fact
that publishers of newspapers in
every country In the world with
the exception of the Central Al
lies are now buying print paper
on the American market
The exportation of print paper
this year was the largest in the
history of the country.

BUT SHAPIRO ALWAYS STAYS
"o Back-Home Trip for This Univer
sity of Missouri Student.
Some may come and some may go,
but this student remains. For three
Christmases F. E. Shapiro, a senior in
the School of Journalism, whose home
Is In New York has stayed In Colum
bia. Since he came here In 1914 he
has not passed out of Columbia's
boundary.
In three years Mr. Shapiro has
watched students come in with the
excitement of freshmanhood; leave at
Christmas to overcome homesickness;
come back full of memories; then dit
to faster and the big depletion in
June.
In the summer he has become ac
quainted with the summer- school type
the serious, pedantic, reserved school
teachers. He has sighed through the
six weeks between the summer session
and regular session and played all
over again the role of spectator.

GLIMPSE OF CHRISTMAS SPIEIT
Jnst An Incident of the Season At the
Postoffiee.
He lives in Columbia and he isn't
rich in gold. He went to the postof
fiee today and addressed more than a
hundred, plain, Inexpensive Christmas
greeting cards to his friends. He was
not well dressed his clothes were
slick, the elbows were shiny, and the
cuffs worn. His shoes had evidently
been half-soled before and his hat
looked like all hats do that have been
worn for three seasons.
But his face ;whcn you looked there
you forget all about the shoes, and the
threadbare suit. And if you had seen
him count his money, to see It he was
able to buy Christmas greeting stamps
from the woman who was selling them
in the lobby, you might have caught a
glimmering of what you and your
neighbors seek for at this time of the
year Christmas spirit
Little penny cards filled with good
will and friendship, and sent at a sac
rifice, he had. But they radiated sin
cerlty.
PAY SOW, 0B PAY EXTBA
J. R. Jordan, County Tax Collector,
Says Tax Payments Are Slow.
A last call has been Issued to Co
lumbia people to pay their taxes. Aft
er December 30 a penalty of 5 percent
on each $100 valuation will be Im
posed on all back taxes.
"The people have been unusually
slow In paying their taxes this year,"
said J. R. Jordan, county tax collec
tor this morning. "The cash valua
tion of the receipts probably Is as
high as it was at this time last year,
but because of the special 25 cent
road and bridge tax and the 5 cent
increase in the school tax imposed
this year, it means that not as many
people have paid."
PLEJfTY OF WHEAT HEBE
Enough at Boone County Mill to Last
All Season.
"There's nothing in the talk about a
scarcity of wheat at our mill," Hugh
Baker, superintendent of the Boone
County Milling Company, said this
afternoon. "We have enough local
wheat to last us almost the whole
season, that Is, until June. The sea
son ends July. And by that time the
harvest will permit us to make up this
Insignificant shortage with new wheat"
"There was a .scarcity in the crop
this year, but this was not only a lo
cal abnormality. It was general
throughout the country.

CHRISTMAS MAIL BUSH IS ON
Delay Caased 2 Deliveries This Morn
ing; Local Ofice Is Prepared.
Columbia's Thursday afternoon mail
notdeHvered until this morning.
The Wabash 1:45 o'clock train did
not run and the Katy train was about
two hours late. The first mail to get
into Columbia after the 7 a.m. mail
yesterday morning was at 5:40 o'clock
in the evening. The carriers made
two deliveries this morning.
Everything possible is being done
by the local postoffiee force to avoid
delay and congestion in the delivery
and receiving of Christmas packages.
Two clerks were stationed in the lobby
who receive the packages and find the
correct zone. Then they are taken
to the stamp window where they are
insured and stamped. It is then but
a step to the mailing window. AH this
is done in but a few minutes and there
Is no contusion, crowding or trouble.
The windows are plainly marked and
it is exceedingly easy and convenient
to get the package off.
Although this year's out-going mail
is heavier than ever before. It Is all
sent out the day it is received. It
took a big moving van to carry the
packages from the Co-Op store to the
post office yesterday. This was the
biggest load ever taken from there.
The post office insured about 500
packages yesterday, covering an ap
proximate value of $2,000.
Five wagons will deliver parcel post
packages Sunday and there will be
one delivery Christmas morning. Let
ters and packages in order to go out
on the evening Wabash trains must
be mailed before 7:15 p. m. To catch
the M. K. & T. trains they should be
mailed before 9 o'clock.

POLICE CHIEF SAYS
TO LOCK THE DOORS
J.
L. Whitesides Tells of
Carelessness Which Re
sults in Losses.
ONE MORE ROBBERY
Grocery Store in Negro Dis
trict Entered ; Change and
Milk Gone.
"If the citizens of Columbia and
University students would take com
mon sense precautions against thieves
and burglars there would be a marked
decrease in the number of such cases
reported," said Chief of Police W. H.
Whitesides to a MIssourian reporter
this afternoon.
"In fraternity houses doors are nev
er locked, and the same conditions ex
ist at sorority houses where yonng
women are alone, with the excepUon
of a chaperon. Jewelry of all kinds,
money and valuables of every descrip
tion are left scattered on dressing
tables, a constant temptation to the
negroes who take care of tho houses.
"Few Columbia citizens lock their
doors at night and locks on windows
are even rarer. After the Alpha Delta
Pi house robbery a month ago locks
were put on all the windows except
the one which the robber had entered,
and he got in through the same win
dow Wednesday night
"If these precautions were taken an
intruder would make some noise,
enough to arouse the people in the
house, the police could be called to
chase the robber away.
"An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure," says Chief Whitesides.
If Ora Arthur, escaped negro con
vict is responsible for the series of
unsolved robberies and holdups in
Columbia, he knows his field well and
with the departure of the students
yesterday he confined his activities to
one small robbery lastnlght that .of
a grocery store in the negro" district
Only a small amount of small
change was taken but afterward the
thief opened the store icebox and
drank a supply of milk.
Chief of Police Whitesides said
this afternoon that the owner of the
grocery store said that he thought he
knew who was responsible for the rob
bery and that action by the police was
unnecessary.
No arrests have been made.
No new developments have taken
place in regard to the robberies
Wednesday night, although Chief
Whitesides say's that he believes the
police are in better poslUon now to
catch the robber than ever before.
That the robbery of the Delta Tau
De'ta fraternity house and the Alpha
Delta Pi sorority house was not the
work of the same person is the firm
belief of Chief Whitesides. He be
lieves that the robber who stoic the
money from the clothes at the Delta
Tau Delta house had an Intimate
knowledge of the surroundings. He
believes that the Job was done by
some one who had either worked at
the house or who was familiar with
its construction and its occupants.
Chief Whitesides thi3 afternoon de
fended the position of the police In
wishing absolute silence from the vic
tims of the recent robberies.
Chief Whitesides says that it is im
possible to get one negro to tell about
the sins of another and if it becomes
known that a negro is wanted by the
police that nearly the entire negro
population of Columbia will aid in the
guilty negro's escape.
