against Mr. Palne'a reading from

again.
"How can the commission know

The Commissioner ruled that the

would leave both bodies without a,

Postmaster General Understood
to Suport Government Own
ership Here.
SENDS LETTER TO JOHNSON
Has Often Advocated Postalfza-
tion of Communication
by Wire.
Postmaster General Burleson Is un
derstood to have written a letter to
Chairman lien Johnson, of the House
District Committee, strongly support-
lug the proposal In the Lewis bill
for (the Government ownership and
oporatlon of the telephone lines In
the District of Columbia.
This letter, It Is said, was written
In response to Congressman Johnson's
request for Information as to the at
titude of the Postofflce Department
on the Lewis bill.
Ker Pastallsatlen.
In his several annual reports the
Postmaster General has advocated
consideration by Congress of the
postallsatlon of communication by
wire in this country. From time to
time there has been discussion In Con
gress regarding the Government own
erahlp of the telephone and telegraph
lines, but the postallsatlon movement
so far has not gained momentum.
The Lewis bill, however, proposes
a concrete plan for the operation of
telephones In the National Capital.
Mr. Lewis, author of the parent post
law, haa given study to the telephono
rates In America and Kurope, and
asserts that Washington Is paying
far too much for Ita telephone service.
Postal rian.
His bttl provides for thn acquisition
and operation of existing lines here
by the Postofflce Department.
A second bill intrlduced by Mr.
Lewis suggests a means for acquiring
these telephone lines. Thn Maryland
Member proposes that the postal sur
plus for thn next fiscal year be taken
and applied toward the purchase price
of the local telephone system.
Kxpeci i4 Surplus.
Postofflce officials expect a hand
some surplus at the end of thn present
fiscal year, and for the next fiscal
year.
It Is reported to members or Con
gress and the department that the
telephone facilities in the District
have a valuation of $0,000,000 to I",
000.000. and It la estimated that the
surplus will be sufficient to take care
of this.
Conrressman Lewis says that tjov-
rnmant ownership In the District of
Columbia would be an entering wedge
for the postallsatlon of all means or
communication.
Weuld Show Practicability.
In this city, he asserts, the practi
cability of Government operation
would be demonstrated.
It Is believed tint the rostofflce
Department will get behind thn Lewis
bill; although there Is still do -lit
that the measure can bn put through
both houses of Congress at the short
session. An effort will bn mude, how
ever, to get an early report from the
District Committee, which probably
will meet with 'the return of Chair
man Johnson, after the holidays,
