Christmas Is not what It should be. We have drifted away fram. tha
original meaning ef Christmas. Tha festival la no longer In keeping
with the whole-eoulod Joy at the birth ef' Christ. The aid, simple Christ
mas of "Peace on earth, good will' to men" haa not been headed throughout
tho ages.
We have failed U maintain the happ Ineea ef flvlng aa tha "Three Wise
Men" Joyfully gave centuries age. Wa have' failed to reraamhar that It la
more bleaaed to give than to receive. We ara mare prone to five, net fram
the promptings of Joy, but from duty and' Mfcaatlafi. If wa Joyfully and
more free-heartedly gave at Chrlstmaa time, we would b toe Marnier and
younger for It
The children have kept tha Christ waa alive, but we, Uw-aMar people,
have drifted from tho original meaning and hav demeraluee) toe aairod
meaning ef Christmas. Surely thla la a time when we can cultivate a mora
generous, gay and Joyful spirit.
