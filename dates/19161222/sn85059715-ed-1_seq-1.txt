United States Hopes to Become
Clearing House for Views
and Terms of Peace.
DIPLOMATS ARE WATCHING
Peace is Pointed Out as More
Essential to European Neutrals
Than This Country.
CSV ASSOCIATED
WASHINGTON. Dec. 22?With tli
purpose of President Wilson's note
to belligerents clarified by official
statements on the subject, the attention
of the United States has turned
to the reception of the note in foreign
capitals.
Diplomats here are eagerly -watching
for indications of whether the
Europeans will follow the lead of the
"United States and make a similar ap nonl
fn thn wnrrinp- nnwprs
There is growing feeling that the
"United. States hopes to become the
clearing house for views and possible
for terms of the belligerents. Several
of the diplomats have advised theii
governments to that effect in order tc
guide them in their replies.
The question very much to the fore
led ay was whether the European neutrals
would present a united appeal
The Spanish and Swiss representatives
here have been at the state department
repeatedly since those proposals
came out and probably knovi
full the plans of this government.
It Is pointed out that the Europear
neutrals have suffered beyond an3
other nations not actually involved ir
the war and that peace is more essential
tn them than any but the actual
belligerents. In addition they hav?
no bitterness of.war and none of itf
ambitions and are anxious more foi
the coming of peace than for the accomplishment
of any other purpose
Nevertheless their geographical position
between the two contending
forces has been so dangerous that ui
to now they have been able to do nc
more than maintain their neutrality
without mixing in the struggle ever
to suggesting peace. Part of thii
danger is, however, thought removed
by the American action.
Charge Grew reported to the sttat
department Friday that the presi
dent's peace note had been received
Sn Berlin.
Early London press comment tha
the note was painful because it sale
the objects of the belligerents wen
practically the same was not unex
pected here, where attention has al

President Wilson specifically declarec
that the published views of the oppos
ing statesmen left that impression.
It is stated ofiicially that the pres
ident would not presume to say tha
the two groups were fighting for thi
same object, but merely that thel
official spokesman had outlined mucl
the same general program withou
going into the actual details which hi
now seeks.

LONDON. *Dec. 22?The Britisl
government win mane uu 1 cinV nu ,?present
in regard to President Wll
son's peace note, considering it :
question tliat can be dealt with onl:
in communication with other mem
bers of the Entente Allies. An
nouncement to this effect was madi
in the House of Commons Priday b:
Andrew Bonar Law, chancellor of th
exchequer.
Mr. Law was asked whether :
statement could be made regardlm
the American note. He replied:
"It must be obvious to the Hous
that this is a question that can onl;
be dealt with in communication wit
our allies and that it is absolute!
Impossible to make a statemen
now."
Referring to President Wilson'
note, the Evening Standard says:
"Any communication from th
head of a great and friendly power i
assured of courteous and respectfu
consideration, but it would be onl
; misleading the president to leave hit
t under the impression that any mov
ou his part toward peace at thl
time of the war would be welcome
fcjr Great Britain or Its allies. It i
singular indeed that statesmen c
Mr. Wilson's perspicuity can labo
under any such illusion. The whol
facts of the situation should war
him that his intervention is not d(
sired.
'iHe speaks of a league to iusui
peace and justice. Such a league a
ready exists. It consists of Great Bri
| aln, France, Russia. Italy and tl
I smaller powers. All have had an ui
hill fight They now see the road fair
clear before them. The enemy hi
j given a shrill cry of distress. Tl
! next few months ought to complete li
discomfiture.
'Tf the president could realize wh;
those war-worn peoples reel he wou
surely not suggest that they shou
forego all their, cherished hopes ai
trust their very' existence once mo
to rotten parchment bonds."
