FIRE WARNING
laed by Chief Newell In Reward to
Danger From the Consuming Ele
ment at the Christmas Time.
BOtHO OK r:niTTIOv
Fire Chief Newell has Issued a very
timely warning In regard to the use
of Chriatmaa decorations and the dan
gera arising from the carelesaness of
persona at the holiday season. The
warning is aa follows.
Do not decorate youT Chriatmaa tree
with paper, cotton or any other In
flammable material. Use metallic tinsel
and other non-inflammable decora
tions only, and aet the tree aecurely
so that the children in reaching for
thinga cannot .tip It over.
Do not use cotton to represent snow.
If you must have anow uae aabeatos
fibre.
Do not permit children to light or
relight the candles while parents are
not present. They frequently aet Are
to their clothing Instead.
Do not leave matches within reach
of children at holiday time. Candles
arc meant to be lighted, and if the
children can get matches they will
experiment with them. They Imitate
their elders.
Do not allow treea to remain inside
buildings after the holidays The tree
Itself ignites readily when needles
have become dry. A large number of
fires usually occur in January from
this cause.
A house of merriment la better than
a house of mourning.
Fires in winter Impose unusually
severe hardships upon the firemen.
Frozen hands and feet are common
Incidents in fighting winter fires.
Pneumonia frequently follows expo
sure of those driven by fires out into
tho cold. Defective heating and light
ing equipments and conbustible rub
bish in furnace rooms are tthe usual
causes of winter fires. Such fires are
unnecessary and will not occur in
premises properly cared for.
Warning for Stores. Churches and
Bazaars. Holiday Area in these while
filled with people are uaually holo
causts. Light, Inflammable decora
tions make fires easy to start and easy
to spread. A match, a gas flame or
an electrical defect may do It.
Watch gas Jets! Decorations may
be carried against them by air cur
rents. Do not make the slightest change In
electric wiring without consulting
electrical Inspector.

of "French Ivory" to compare with
that shown by Murphy, the Jeweler.

customers. Call and have a look.
BANQI'ET SI'CCESSFCL
The larger number of adults pres
ent to witness the children enjoy them
selves the banquet In the Christian
Church last night, seemed to be a suc
cess in every way. There were over
sixty persons of the ageB from Cradle
Roll to Junior department who were
seated at the tables. The names on
the place cards showed that over twen
ty were unable to attend. Much cred
it for the success of the banquet was
due to the efforts of the Junior Super
intendent, MrB. Ned Piper. She was
assisted, by the Cradle Roll Superin
tendent, niTB. i-ranK Keun, Mrs. j. is.
Dawson and other Junior workers. An
effort was made to get a flash light
picture of those preaent after the ban
quest had been served. This form of
a treat for the little ones will be ob
served again.
