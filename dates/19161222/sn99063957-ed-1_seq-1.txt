British Army Keeps Busy
Plugging Away on West Front
By William Phillips Simms
(United Press staff correspondent)
With the British Armies in the Field,
Bee. IP. (Delayed) While the Preach
are rolling back the German crown
prince's army before Verdun, the lirit-i.-!i
army is not idle.
Through the heavy snow and driving
rain with a cold tang in the air remi-
aueem 01 i nnstmas the ISntish armv
Js plugging away in perfect accord with
me oongnty Heroes defending the his- j
toric citadel of Verdun. J
ff the news from this end of the lirfe!
at present isn t very sensational, it is
because the allied plans decree it so.
No one need doubt that absolute unity
ol retion exists along this front, from
th? salt water to the Swiss mountains.
After the latest victory at Verdun
th? British army straightened for a
moment to applaud its brothers in arms
1 and then Lent back to its task.
That the British do not intend that
the enemv shall have any more rest un
til the end of the war is apparent. Vis
its to back areas give this impression
as distinctly as those to the front lines.
There is a vast' war plant there buzzing
HM a great, busy mill.
In the trenches powerful mortars are
-: .mining away continually, mcthodical
ly lobbing over sinister bombs from
the size and shape of a wine bottle to
those of a footbsil almost keg size. I
Bitter Over President W -
I European intervention in the middle of
! the civil war," declared the Westmin
ster Gazette. "But if President Wil-
I son has knowledge, hitherto denied US,
that the enemy is willing to ackn rwl-
: edge our statements, he well knows we.
: would be the last to reject his good
: offices. ' '
The favorite remarks With which the
Wilson note has been greeted were that
! it. was ''ill timed," "inopportune,"
"doubtless well intcntioned but ill ad
vised" and ''deplorable blunder."
Pew question the motives or the
spirit which impelled the note, but
I most of the editorials point out that it
was unhappily conceived and tactlessly
worded especially in its references to
((smal nations. " This it was contend-
j ed, conveyed the impression that the
allies were equally guilty with the cen
tral powers in this respect.

Rapidly body-to-body struggles in
which the British excel and which the
Germans dislike are often a feature
of these raids. Dugouts are frequently
raided where the Teutonic defenders,
sleeping the sleep 0 i'exhauBtion, have
been awakened from the arms of Mor
pheus to find themselves in the arms
of British Tommies.
All this contributes to the highly ner

London, Dec. 22. British official cir-
cles refuse to believe that America, in
the note by President Wilson, is asking

war on the side of the allies, unless Ger
many accedes to the allies' demands.
But as a rule, utter inability to under
stand the motives behind the presi
dent's note were apparent.
The Evening News' head to the text
of the Wilson note was the triple nega
tive, in big type, "No! No! No!5' witli
the further caption "This la Britain's
Answer, Wiven Without Hesitation to
President unison's surprising Note."
!' President Wilson's seal for human
ity has evoked a step which will create
the bitterest resentment of all those
who fighting, working and dying for

of the city was raging at daybreak to- j
day. This information reached here by)
wire to Mexican government officials.
The only news of the attack was a j

less as the assault started. The message
reached El Paso by land wires.
Early yesterday Villistas Captured
Bermijillo, about thirty miles north of
Torreon, after the garrison had fled
to the latter city.
Torreon is the railway key to north
ern Mexico, many lines converging at
his point. In possession of Villa, the
bandit chief could dominate the rail
ways leading to the northeastern bor
der. The population of Torreon is a
bout 40,000.
Villa with 5,000 troopB was reported
yesterday as approaching Torreon and
driving back government troops sent
north to oppose his advance.
Military observers here point out that
Villa should have little difficulty in
taking Torreon, as the garrison there
was weakened when General Murgia

spent "a great deal of money" in suchll
purchases during the months sueeeediiiL' 1

He made these statements in cross
examination by I'nited States District
Attorney Preston during the trial ol''
himself ami associates on charge of
neutrality violations. When Hupp ad
mitted having purchased rubber and

sisted that these two products are both

at length regarding the so called "se

the disposition of the consulate bv the
I Berlin government. This fund is said
I tO have amounted to tlO&OOO. Mono
said he used "a great deal" of money,
but wouldn 't specify the total.
Bopp said that he personally was in
charge of this fund and that he made
reports regarding disbursements direct

he could not detail the dis-
bursements, as he had no! ken! anv roc

"What expense, need or desire did
you have for $100,000 in March W15t"
Preston asked.
"That has nothing to do with this
ease." was Bopp's peppery answer.
Asked who had requested the so call
ed "secret fund" from the German
government, Bopp replied merely: "Ask
Von Sehaack," (the vice consul). Bopp
finally stated, however, that he needed
such a fund to make extensive purchas
es of rubber and nickel, When asked
direct whether he had purchased "mu

with a good deal of contempt of the
bomb model which Van Sehaack had

lain around the consulate for a long
time "and we occasionally took it Up

1 1 ,, -..
not tlatlv turn down the suggestions
made bv ' President Wilson in his pence
messages, was the expressed belief
ol
some entente diplomats here today.
This opinion was voiced to a I'nited
Press correspondent in intimate and con
fidentlal talks at two of the most im
portant entente embassies in Washing'
ton.
At these embassies two reasons wen
given for the above opinion:
To show officially and formally '
"'S"'et " over the president's peuee
any
sug
gestions by tint I y refusing 111s request
for specific terms would be playing di
rectly into (ierniauv 's plans, since Ger
many then would have opportunity to
reiterate oft repeated protestations that
the entente allies are responsible for
prolonging the war.
Such a flat turndown would tend to
weaken what sympathy there is now
in the United States for the entente al
lied cause.
These allied diplomats did not hesi
tate to admit "chagrin" over the pros
blent 's suggestion that specification of
war objectives is necessary. They said
allied speakers have been specifying
their objectives for two years and n
half and that they ought to be appar
ent to all students of the war. It was
this phase of the president 's note one
which seemed to cause more regret than
bitterness which wus particularly em
phasized by the diplomats.

Beunot Aires, Dec. 22. The first)
Statement of the American Secretary j

here to close up clam-iike. His subse

Secretary Lansing's Two
Statements of Yesterday
Mystify Diplomats
By Robert J. Bender.
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 22. Recovering
slowly from the dizzy whirl of yester-
day'o history making developments,
government officials and foreign diplo
mats here today looked to the foreign
effiee of the belligerent nations for the
IK xt peace move.
As outlined in early reports strong
exception was at first taken to Presi
dent Wilson's overtures in both English
ami Canadian press. The outspoken ex
pirssion, seemingly (oday has been toned
down, the move now being called mere
ly "inopportune." The attitude of al
lied diplomats here also shows a trend
in the same direction.
The ndministra(ion believes, how
ever, this feeling is not sufficient to
east any real gloom over the situatioa-
It appears the same surprise and won
derment was occasioned in Europe by
the president's overtrures as woer mani
fest hero when his move became known.
The first wonderment over, the presi
dent believes the warriors will feel far
more inclined at least seriously and
rarefnUy to consider his suggestions.
Accurate sounding of the allied gov
ernment's attitude cannot be-definitely
