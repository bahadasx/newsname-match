London, Dec 22. British official
circles refuse to believe that America,
In the note by President Wilson, is
asking the allies to give up all prin
ciples and retract official utter mces
regarding the war's slm that have
'Been so emohatlcallr - innnnnu

American correspondents tonight
,met' pained wonderment everywhere
among the government authorities
over the peace note. In some quart

President Wilson waa aiming pri
marily to Impress upon Germany
that the United States may be forced
eventually to enter the war on the
side of the allies, unless Germany ac
cedes to the allies' demands.
But, as a rule, utter Inability to
understand the motives behind the

chief executive's more.
The afternoon press was a unit tn
Its resenttulness. This bitterness waa
particularly manifested against Wil
son's sssertfon thst the object for
which all belligerents were striving
were virtually the same.
"It Is alngular, Indeed." the Even
ing Standard declared, "that a states
man of Wilson's perspicacity can la
bor under the delusion that any move
of bis toward peace would be wel
comed by the allies. The whole facts
of the situation should warn Mm that
Intervention la not desired."
"We sincerely hope President Wil
son Is not ill," the Globe commented,
"but we have grare doubts of his
physical well being."
"Our feelings against outslie ac
tion to Stoo the war before the es
sential objects have been obtained
are only what Wilson's treat nre-
decessor felt when threatened with
European Intervention In the middle
of the civil war," declared the West
