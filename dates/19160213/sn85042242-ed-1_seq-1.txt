To a reporter he said:
Met By Appointment.
"I met' lier by appointment in the
woods. I told her not to tell anyone
I was coming. 1 mussed up my bed
at niy boarding place in Madison so
my landlady would think I had been
there. 1 arrived at Lake Forest late
Tuesday night and called her by tele
phone at her home on the Jonas Kup
enheimer farm. I told her I would
be waiting the next morning at' the
iSacrcd Heart station of the Chicago
& Milwaukee Electric line. I saw her
when she passed toward the station
"with her chum, Josephine Davis. I
was hiding behind a tree and beckon­
ed to her. Soon, she came back.
Cried And Begged.
"We started walking. I told her I
was through with her. She cried and
'begged me not to give her up. We
walked and talked in the woods about
two hours.
"Finally I told her there was no use
talking any longer—that I had made
up my mind. 1 was going to marry
Miss Youker. I started away.
Did Not Heed Call.
•fl heard her cry out for me to
come back. I kept' on walking.
"I was quite a distance away when
I turned again. I saw her fall to the
ground. 1 ran back. 1 saw she /was
dying.
"1 remained with her until I was
sure she was dead. Then I hurried to
the station fend took an electric car
and came to Chicago. I caught a train
at Chicago right out for Madison.
Then I sent a letter to her, 1 didn't
tell anyone about what had happened
because I feared it might reflect on
her good name."

"We had to charge Opet with mur­
der, because it was the only way we
could hold Mm. He is the man who
was with the girl, but there are other
things to be cleared up. We haven't
found where the poison came from:
we have not fathomed why Opet was
so careful to frame an-alibi we can't
find the container in which the pois­
on was kept."

Rojas was sentenced to death for
stealing ammunition and a civilian
named Sanchez is to pay the death
penalty for buying it.
The other three civilians are mere­
ly to experience the sensation of lac­
ing the firing squad as an "object les­
son," but will not be killed. They
are to be ignorant of their fate until
Rojas and Sanchez have been execut­
ed, according to the general, who is
said to have conceived this form of
punishment. Two of the three were
charged with having stolen a quanti­
ty of logs and beans from an Ameri­
can owned ranch in western Chihua­
hua. The charge against the third,
buying stolen ammunition, is said to
have been not entirely proven.
Have "Death List."
Passengers arriving here tonight
on a train from Mexico reported they
had met and talked with members of
a firing squad of the Carranza army,
who were carrying a "death list" con­
taining the names of persons to be ar­
rested and executed as enemies of
the de facto government. A number
of former adherents, of Villa and Ma
terna, former Villa governor of the
state of Sonora, already have been
killed, it was learned, according to
Francisca Mayotoral, at one time a
captain in .Materna's forces.
Garrison Threatened.
Indications that rebel bands are
moving on Tuxpam, Mexico, in such
force as to endanger the Carranza
garrison there reached the state de­
partment today in consular dispatch­
es. The (Mexican gunboat, Machias,
has been ordered to Tuxpam from
Tampico.
Details are lacking, but previous dis­
patches have told of a revival of reb­
el activity in the oil fields about
Tuxpam, where large American prop­
erties are located.
MYSTERIOUS FIRES
(New York, Feb. 12.—The British
freighter, Mineric, which sailed from
here this morning for Vladivostok,
with railroad supplies for the Russian
government, put back to port this af­
ternoon. The reason was reported to
be engine trouble. Three weeks ago
the freighter, iSygna, also bound to
Vladivostok, with railroad supplies,
was forced to return here on account
of a fire, which broke out aboard.
At the same time, it was said that
the Are was accidental, and the Sygna
resumed her voyage three days later.
WERNER HORN SI
DECLARED SANE
Boston, Feb. 12.—It was learned to­
day that Werner Horn, an officer of
the German Landwehr, who is accus­
ed of having attempted to wrec*
railroad bridge across the interna­
tional boundary at Vanceboro, Maine,
has been declared sane by three phy­
sicians who recently examined him.
Horn is in the East Cambridge jail.
New Rockford, a town south of Devils Lake, on the Great
Northern, is making a move to have the State Capital changed
from Bismarck to that place. Petitions arc being circulated to
submit the matter at next fall's election. Vfc doubt much, if
the people of this county will be interested enough to take the
plan seriously. Bismarck has one perfectly good capital, none
the worse for wear, tear and red paint, and there is no need of
the people spending from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 making a change.
What New Rockford should have is a resort for its feeble
minded.

in the safe blowing in the govern­
ment buildiug at St. Paul, from which
$050,000 worth of United States in­

''J
Proposed federal legislation to
make military instruction compulsory
in all educational institutions having
land grants is not likely to be op­
posed in North Dakota. There are
seven educational institutions with
land grants, btit only two have mili­
tary departments. At the Agricultur­
al college in Fargo military instruc­
tion is featured and the commandant
is a regular army officer. Three or
four well drilled companies are main­
tained. At the Normal-Industrial at
Ellendale there is military instruc­
tion. Prior to the 'Spanish-American
war the state university conducted
military courses but at that time the
equipment was called in by the gov­
ernment and it has not been renew­
ed.
Regardless of their views on the
general subject of preparedness many
people in the state would like to see
military instruction at the state edu­
cational institutions. They believe
the drill is highly beneficial to the
student.
In the event of war, many believe
military instruction in these institu­
tions would solve the problem of fur­
nishing officers.

night with an open mind, expecting
during his trip to-give careful consid­

St. Paul, Feb. 12.—Colonel Josiah R.
King, who was said to be the first vol­
unteer to answer the original call of
President Abraham Lincoln for 75,000
men for civil war service in April,
1861, is dead at his home, 277 West
Seventh street, St. Paul. Colonel King
died almost on the eve of the birth­
day anniversary of President Lincoln
and on the 55th anniversary of the de­
parture of the great commoner from
his home in Springfield, III., for Wash­
ington to assume the presidency.
His Statue In Summit Park.
A statue of Colonel King in Summit
park, St. Paul, will help preserve his
memory to future generations. His
last days were days of suffering and
helplessness, due to an injury he ex­
perienced March 8. 1915, in a street­
car accident. In modest quarters,
ministered to by his wife, who alone
survives him, the veteran answered
the final call at 4:30 p. m., Thursday.
Colonel King:s pride was in his ser­
vice to his country. He died a poor
man, but friends who remembered
what he had been and what he had
done were not lacking when the last
stressful months came,

Law and Practices of All Nations
Affected by Recent Order
Differ.
FRENCH MERCHANTMEN
CANNOT CARRY GUNS
British and French Ships Carry
Guns for Use as Defensive
Weapons.
mLmmmrnrnm_
London, Feb. 12.—Tho belief strong­
ly urged by the British press*,. that
merchant ships of all the Allied na­
tions would be similarly affected by
any restrictions on their carrying
armament or neutral passengers, have
developed the fact that the law and
practice of all the Allies is not uni
lorm concerning the arming of mer­
chant vessels.
The British and Italian practice rec­
ognizes armament for defensive pur­
poses and the prevailing view of the
press is such that a recognized right
under international law.
French Law Different.
•But the French practice does not
recognize the arming of merchant
ships and French liners to New York
are not permitted to carry any guns.
The legal thefcry of which the
French practice is based is an out­
growth of the principle that guns are
the property of the King, and that' to
private individual or ship shall be
permitted to use them. In case a
French merchant ship mounts guns, it
immediately becomes a naval auxil­
iary. This diversity in law and prac­
tice indicates that all the Allies would
not be similarly affected by any ac­
tion growing out of the recent propos­
als and warnings concerning the dis­
armament of merchantmen.

Pierre, S. D., Feb. 12.—The house

providing for a constitutional amend­
ment for good roads, which had been
tacked on to the rural credits resolu­
tion, and amended it by cutting it
loose entirely from rural credits and

New German
Note Reaches
Washington
Washington, iFeb. 12.—Germany's
formal note to the United States, an­
nouncing its intention to treat armed
merchantmen of the Entente allies as
warships after February 29, reached
the state department today. The pol­
icy of the United States in regard to
the declaration of the Central powers,
probably, will be defined sometime
next week, after a note similar to that
issued by Germany is received from
the Vienna foreign office.
It was pointed out today in high offi­
cial quarters that the United States
would have to reach a decision quick­
ly, only 17 days remaining before the
effective date of this declaration, after
which commanders of German and
Austrian .submarines are expected to
receive orders permitting the torpedo­
ing without warning of any ship
which is armed.
VIRULENT
FOUND III
CUESTSJRE IE
Chef at Club Is Missing and the
Dope Is Found in His
Room.
CHURCH DIGNITARY DID
NOT PARTAKE HEAVILY
Chicago, Feb. 12.—Virulent poison
was found today by city chemists in
samples of the soup served at the
banquet in honor of Archbishop *Mun
delein at the University club, Thurs­
day night. The discovery, coupled
with the disappearance of a kitchen
employe of the club, and the finding
of a similar poison in a private lab­
oratory in his room, together with
literature classed as anarchistic, led
the po'-ice to believe that the illness
whichi overcame more than 1Q.0 of the
diners' was the deliberate atteihpt to
poison the guests.
The nature of the poison discovered
and fear that perhaps a slow acting
poison had also been mingled with
the banquet's viands prompted the
city health commissioner, Dr. John
D. iRobertson, to issue a warning to
all who attended the banquet to place
themselves immediately under the
care of a physician.
Several of the distinguished guests
were so affected that they have not
yet recovered. Two are still confin­
ed to their beds, and a number of
others today said that they still felt
the effects of the poisonous soup.
Archbishop Mundelein was not af­
fected by the poison. He ate very
sparingly of the soup and said today
that he had not felt any ill effects.
The absence of Jean Crones, assist­
ant chef at the club, was noted by
the manager, H. J. Doherty, and his
suspicions were aroused. With a po­
liceman, he went to Crones' room in
Prairie avenue and there discovered
the laboratory and found the poison
glass.
HOLDS AT PIEIIRE MIIDFLL IIIMS
Washington, Feb. 12.—Debate on
the postoffice bill in the house today
was diverted for two hours into a
rambling preparedness discussion,
during which Representative Mon
dell, republican, of Wyoming, attack­
ed Representative Quinn of Missis­
sippi, a democratic member of the
committee and a former anti-prepar­
edness advocate for his recent change
of attitude.
Mr. Mondell declared President
Wlilson's preparedness arguments
lacked facts to liack them, and said
the president had "simply tried to put
a scare into timid folks." Mr. Quinn
vigorously defended the president.
HIRED MAN SHOT
E
New Rockford, Feb. 12.—At 6:30
o'clock this Thursday morning,
George Riddle, who lives on the Nels
K. Mattson farm, five miles north of
this city, was fatally shot by 'Nick
Chenos when he entered the sitting
room approaching the kitchen where
the hired man was making a fire in
the kitchen range.
Not suspecting anything Mr. Riddle
was caught wholly by surprise when
Chenofe wheeled around and fired
three shots from a .38 calibre revolver
into his body, one of the bullets enter­
ing his liver, one piercing his lungs
and the third lodging in the upper por­
tion of the left breast.
The wounded man's wife tried to get
help from the neighbors but their tele­
phone was out of working order, when
after some time (nearly noon) she
prevailed upon Chenos to go to the
Frank Anderson home and summon
Dr. Crawford from this city, who hur­
ried to the victim's relief.
