NIAGARA FALLS, N. Y. Feb. 12.—
This peaceful mecca of honeymoon-{to
trs felt that It was closer to the war
tonight than at any time since the
outbreak of hostilities in Burope.
Across the great gorge of the river
ind beyond the roaring falls on whose
Jpiak stand the Canadian power
house, it is known extra guards are
on duty. Machine guns are trained
tpon approaches from the interna
tional bridge. Niagara Falls, Ontario,
in the Canadian side, is virtually un

toned today warning ciuzens not to
assemble or loiter in the streets and
strangers are closely questioned
shadowed by government agents.

an papers were ordered today to
print nothing regarding troop move
ments and American papers on the
border were inormed that if such
I stories were published, their papers
would be confiscated in Canada.
Since the outbreak of .the war,
Niagara Falls has beoome a big mu
nitfon manufacturing center. All fac
tories are working day and night. The
principal output is chemicals, such as
1 liquid chlorine, used by the belliger
ents in gas bombs, and nitrates used
In the manufacture of high explosives.
Many strangers are here and start

General Manager Ma* Mauran, of
the Castner plant, refused to admit
tonight that he believed last night's
explosion was due to a plot of teu
tonic sympathizers. Ho expressed the
belief that the trouble was entirely
local and In no way connected with
the war and declared It was probably

made public tonight.
Dr. John Dill Robertson, city health
superintendent, discovered that 125
women had been served Thursday
night with soup made in the same
kettle in which the broth served for
the banquet was brewed. This, Rob
ertson believed, seemed to elir* nate
any chance for the kettle having been
at fault, as none of the women were
made ill.
Neither Archbishop Mimdetein, Gov
ernor Dunne, Roger Sullivan nor any
of the prominent guestB at the ban
quet showed any 111 effects of the
poisoning tonight. Some of those who
were made sertously ill immediately
after partaking of the soup, said they
were fully recovered.
Notwithstanding these statements,
Robertson tonight warned all of those
who were at the banquet to secure
medical examination immediately. A
signed statement from H. J. Doherty,
manager of the club, gave ifee same
advice.
Doherty said he considered the
evidence unearthed tonight as a com

that unclean conditions In the clubs

Doherty told the police that clones
aided in preparing the soup. This,
he said, coupled with Clones' disap

the Swiss newspaper Berner Bund.
Anglo-French and Serbian troops

of Italians would not be desirable, It

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.—Without
indicating whether he favored or op
posed the measure. President Wilson
tonight denied Gifford Plnchot's ap
peal to aid 'in the fight on the Shield's
water power bill.
The bill was denounced as a cor
poration measure by Pinchot in an
open letter to the president, and the
executive was told that unless his in
fluence was exerted, there was grave
danger It might pass. Replying to Pin
chot, the president said he would ex
amine the bill if it should pass both
houses and thus come to him for dis
approval..
Pinchot, if the measures makes ap
pearance of success, will write the
president again, urging that his Influ
ence is essential while the bill Is
pending.
While the bill succeeded In getting
on the senate calendar so far ahead
of its turn as to arouse the fears of
its opponents, and while It has ad
vanced rapidly In a week of considera
tion, increasing troubles loom ahead

have been victories for the conserva
tion forces.
Senators Welsh, Husting, Lane,
Hoke Smith and the progressive re
publicans are planning a campaign ot
opposition. Smith's idea is to assure
the turning over of all electric plants
built under the terms of the act to
the government in time of war for
the manufacture of nitrates. The
others disagree flately with the
broad principles of the measure,
llieir first step will be to attempt a
delay on the ground that the new seo
retary of war shonld examine and ap
prove the bill, since he Is its adminis
trator.
The bill provides for the govern
ment leasing to private companies of
power sites on navigable rivers. Meth
ods are provided for returning the
property to the government at the end
of fifty years and of regulating rates.
But these provisions' are so drawn,
Pinchot charges, that their effect will
be drawn out litigation instfead of af
