Ml'SKOGKK, Feb. 18, If Jim Har
ris over hod a chance to succeed
himself as national Republican com
mitteeman from Oklahoma, he cer.
talnly frittered away that chance and
tore tils shirt in ii dosen places by the
double-crosslng-steam-roller methods
which he employed to control the sec
ond district congressional convention,
which mel here today and elocted two
delegates and two alternates to the
national convention and named a
presidential elector. In the first
place the convention was i in
advance of any other convention In
the United States for the purpose of
precipitating u boom tor Colonel
Roosevelt and while the resolutions
praises him the convention went
squari ly on record us noi In favor of
endorsing him and tabled without 1 1 -bate
ii motion to instruct for him,

The minute the convention was
railed t" order the fireworks began
and the greatest disorder prevailed
throughout tin deliberations ami onlj
by enforcing the unit rule and run
ning the steam roller over nearlj half
of the Muskogee delegation was Har
ris and his supporters able to retain
control of tlii situation. By thin
method on i test vote Harris could
only muster iui votes against 97 in
the convention and If the unit rule
had been abrogated the forces op
posed to Harris program would have
romped away with the convention and
upset ail Mis arrangements.
