To the Citizens of Albuquerque:
The undersigned, constituting a ma
jority of the city council of Albuouer
iiue, feel that the time lias come when
it .statement should be made by us re
tarding events, in the city administra
tion during the past twenty-two
months, and proficnl conditions in our
city government. This statement is
due to the citizens of Albunucrque
who are entitled to the facts, and it is
duo to ourselves, since it deals with
criticisms directed against uk which
are unwarranted, and in some In
stances viciously malicious.
Attacks llt-quiro ltejily.
Misstatements of facts have been
made by frlenda of Mayor I'.oatright,
and by the mayor himself, both by
word of muuth and through the news
papers, which seek to lay upon us the
4ilamo for existing conditions in the
administration of city affairs; or. per
haps, for the total lack of administra
tion. We have felt that public agita
tion of thcub matters would not
change existing conditions and might
work a further Injury to our city in
the eyes of the rest of the state. The
attacks upon lis, however, have now
assumed a form so direct, and the ani
mus and. purpose behind them have
become sn clear that in Justice to our
(ielvL'K and to the city we cannot fur
ther Withhold this statement of facts.
In particular the attacks made Upon
us by .Mayor Uuutrighl retiuire a re
ply. Winds Never Tied.
Mayor BoatriglH has charged that
his "hands have been tied" by our
opposition to his measures in the
council and that our topposition" has
been inspired by political motives. We
wish to recall to the citizens of Albu
ouer'iue that upon assuming 'office
Mayor Koatright attempted to remove,
without the consent of the council, the
chief of police of this city, Thomas!
MeMillin, in order to appoint a man
who was tin: mayor's personal choice,
or that of his political advisers. Tho
undersigned, a majority of us being
democrats, believed MeMillin to liv a
chief of police of exceptional ability
and with the unblemished record of
kood service. We refused to support
the mayor in his dismissal because in
our Judgment the man named to re
place him was not his equal in ability,)
efficiency or experience, and for no.
other reason. MeMillin is a republi-l

et. Had the mayor submitted the'
name of a man equally efficient, we:
would have confirmed that, man re
gardless of his personal political faith.
We told Mayor l'.ontriglit this both
with regard to ills appointment of a
chief of police and his selections for
other city offices. We were prepared J
to support any udvance in standards
in the city service. We ' stood ready
tlieu and we stand ready now to sup-,
port the mayor in any nppolntrticnt ;
which will not detract from the effi
ciency of city government. i
As to City Knglneer.
It lias been asserted that the office
of city engineer remains vacant be
cause of our refusal to agree to con-,
firm an appointment by the mayor
This is not true. The office has been
vacant since the removal of Mr. Glad
ding, a republican, to Kl I'aso, and the
city has been without a head to Its
streets or other municipal work re-,
quiring an engineer, simply because
the mayor has been unable to come to
an agreement in his own mind, or;
amongst his advisers, as to an np-j
pointment. We are advised that he
would have appointed A. igle to
this position, an appointment which
we were willing to confirm, but for
the fact that Mr. Ogle, in refusing to,
sign a IPdo for fi deficit in a republl-i
can campaign fund, incurred the dis-j
pleasure of tile mayor's political coun-i
scllorti. j
The t Ity Attorney.
Criticism Jias been directed to the j
present city attorney, and the mayor.
t has asserted that said attorney Is our;
appointment. The fact is that tliei
mayor caused bis emissaries to come;
to certain of the undersigned to as-:
certain if we would confirm the ap
pointment which lie later made. For
various reasons We consented to con-1

q by every record of this city, since
Mr. lioatright became its mayor.
The Segregated IHslrl1.
The mayor charges that his admin
istration lias failed of being efficient,
because the undersigned have ob
structed him in the execution of hi
policies. Mayor lioatright was elected
upon a ida' form pledging him to close
the segregited district. It was nec
essary for this council to act by nso-
hat district, and it was

We received the suggestion with en
thusiasm and urged liint to brlK in
his ordinance, assuring him that it
would be passed. That wan months
Hitn. The ordinance has neverdiccn
iresi;nted. Tho only other action the
mayor Initiated was to call a special
meeting of the council to propoae
granting u permission to in'ivute par
tics to erect on street corners adver
tising signs. We consented to that
action and have learned .since that
when public criticism occurred the
mayor sought to saddle the entire re
sponsibility upon the undersigned.
Itlame Mayor Solely,
Your consideration is invited to a
private business in which the direct
ing head declines to consult with any
of the heads of depart nienls or
branches. Sin h a condition continu
ed for any period of time would re
sult ill precisely the situation which
has come about in our city govern
in lit. This situation, we assert, bus
come about solely throtiKli the attl-
j tuile of unfriendliness, distrust and
! antagonism towards us which Iuih
been exhibited throughout, by Mayor
! lioatright. .
It has been charged bv the mayor
and by the newspapers thai the cuun-
il has done nothing. It mav be
stated that it Is difficult in our form
I of government to do am thing wilh-
Joul the active co-operation of the
mayor. This coiineil, on its own in
itiative, completed ciiuslructlim of
J the city nail. This was done by tho
council and certain private i itizens,
'who secured the necessary signatures
to notes, sufficient to giiarnnt.,. puy-
,umi.:r.siKn,;
llieiit of the cost;- notes winch the
l sined, thus pledging
I their individual credit.
j The mayor and the newspapers have i
criticised Us because We declined to
appropriate money for pnyiuerl for a
park site far out on the mesa, and be
cause we d-cliied to appropriate $."-110
for the state fair. The city did not
i.tl
ive the money for cither of these
purposes, and as to tne fair appro
priation the council had absolutely no
legal right to make such an appro
; priation.
i Hasn't fiono I Him ii Into I'ockcr,
j A citv cannot run behind six or
'seven tlmusand dollars a year and
leontinue in run, any more than can
'a private business. The city had lost
1 considerable revenue, sonic from the
closing (1f the segregated district, that
revenue the mayor stated durum' his
'campaign he would rallier go down
Mil his pocket and pay than accept it
for city purpose. The mayor has
neither none down in his pocket for
...... revenue, nor has he lent UH the
slightest assistance in devising ways
md means for meeting the city s ob
ligations.
The Sunday Saloons.
Mayor HoalrlRht personallv, through
his spokesmen and through the pa
pers, has made the charge that he
cannot close saloons on Sunday be
cause this council will not pass an or
dinance specifically empowering; him
to do mi. In tliis statement the may
or, whether of his own Initiative or
that of his political advisers, is skill
fully playing both ends against thu
middle. He is seeking to hold favor
with that of our citizenship opposed
to sajoonfl. and at the Maine time to
remain the friend of the owners and
operators of the bars. Inquiry will
develop the fact that the saloon in
terests of Albuquerque today are the
mayor's firm friends. He was elected
by the votes of those of our citizens
who are opposed to saloons, .Sunday
or any other day. The fact is that
Mayor lioatright has full authority to
close saloons on Sunday. Other may
ors have done it by a simple older to
the police, who now stand ready and
able to fill the same order whenever
the mayor gives It. The mailer of
open or closed saloons on Sunday in

icy of the I'uitci! Slates ill regard to

Position Well f ounded.
There was strong indication that
various high officials believe the po
sition of tile central powers to be well
founded In view of the changed condi
tions of sea warfare. In many quar
ters it also is considered that the Teu
tonic declarations are a development
of the American memorandum to the

ing of merchant ships and Indicatliq,
that armeil merchantmen entering

Peved l he secretary was informed that
at bast some of the entente, govern

suggestions and that strong protests
might follow should the I nited States

with open minds, but U was Mated on
