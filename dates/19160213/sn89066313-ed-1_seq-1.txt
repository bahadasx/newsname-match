TKOIS HEROINES INTERI'RETEES

de la Resolution Franraise.
"Co n'est pas une etude d'histoire
que je vous apporte ce soir, mals je
veux simplement evoquer pour vous
les trois heroines dp cette epoque lu
gubre," dit .Madame Gucrin vendredi
soir quand ello a apparu devant une
audience, petitie mais enthousiaste.
Dans sa premiere representation, dans
laquellc elle portait une robe a queue,
avec ses cheveux boucles et poudres,
elle a montre Marie Antoinette a l'age
de quatorze ans, a l'epoque ou elle est
venue a Paris pour devenlr la dau
phine dc France.
"Quand le dauphin etait couronne
Louis Sieze, roi de France," dit Mme.
Guerin, en robe de cour, en parlant de
la coronation. "Marie Antoinette avan-
cait parmi le peuple, qui l'acclamait
criant, 'Vive Marie Antoinotte, vive
la reiue,' et toute la France semblait
;ourire. La yeune r lino se Jetait dans
le plaisir, mais ce plaisir lul a coute
cher.
"Elle etait la reine des fetes," dit
Mme. Guerin, cette fois en costume
Watteau de bergere avec une houlette,
"elle jouait le role de bergere a Trian
on Trianon, qui etait ia ville de fetes
no Trian on, qui etait la ville de fetes
et le peuple de France mourait de
faim."
"Les mots liberte, egalite et frater
nite etaient entendu de tout cote, et la
haine de l'Autrichienne grandissait.
Elle dit 'Je sals qu'ils viennent cher
cher ma tete, et je n'ai pas peur.'
"La famille royale fut conduite a
Paris a prison," dit Mme. Guerin, qui
portait dans cette scene une robe noire
de prison. "Le roi fut condamne, et
fut separe de sa famille-separe pour
toujours. Quelques joursapres, le pe
tit dauphin fut arrache des bras de sa
mere. Et a Paris la Terreur regnait.
"Apres une semaine d'agonie, Marie
Antoinette fut traduite devant un tri
bunal, qui demandait si elle vpulalt
dirs qnelquechose pour se justifier. 'Je
tie reccMterni rien ' -lit elle. 'si la
France est heureuse. Vous m'avez en

"Charlotte Corday aimait braucoup

Horace et les heros Grecques d'Homere
tons ceux qui s'etaient sacrefies pour

Quand elle a vu la tyrannie de Dan-
ton, de Robespierre et dc Marat, elle a
dit 'Ce n'est pas la liberte, e'est l'an-

COLUMBIANS SEE NEED
OF A NEW HOTEL HERE
Columbias interviewed yesterday
were virtually unanimous in the
opinion that one of the greatest needs
of the city, if not the greatest, is a
new, up-to-date hotel. While most of
them indorse the Dumas proposition
which has been outlined In the Mis
sourian, some offered ideas along oth
er lines.
Included in the following sym
posium are talking with four traveling
salesmen who happened to be here yes
terday. Without exception they ex
pressed themselves as strong advo
cates of a new hotel for the city. The
interviews follow.
Isidore A. Rarth, clothing merchant
Columbia needs better hotel accom
modations and I am in favor of the
new hotel proposition. At different
times in the past we have had consid
erable trouble in accommodating vis
itors, and I think that the new hotel
will help us out in tills respect in the
future.
Rarwy I). Murry, lawyer I'm not
familiar with the plan under consider
ation, but I'd like for a mass meeting
to discuss it. Unquestionably Colum
bia needs more hotel accommodations.
W. 1). Slum, councilman A hotel is
Columbia's first and greatest need. The
proposed location is the best in town,
situated as it is between the two de
pots and near the postollice. Business
is going to move in that direction, too,
for tlie business section has expanded
as far as it can in the opposite direc
tion. The citizens of Columbia are
back of the proposition and I think
there is no opposition. I'm sure that
the necessary $S,000 will be readily
secured.
Charles Gecry, jeweler I am cer
tainly in favor of a new iiotel for Co
lumbia. I believe that a large, mod
ern, first-class hotel is Columbia's
greatest need. The plan that seems
to be gaining headway now is certainly
the thing. Capital can be readily se
cured, believe, and with the co-operation
of the business men the prospec
tive Iiotel will become a reality.
J. E. (illasple, druggist A new ho
tel would be a great asset for Colum
bia. I think the plans that have been
made for one are ideal.
II. ('. Hunt, cashier of Columbia Sav
ings Bank Columbia needs a hotel
badly and could use it at once. I am
in favor of the proposition now before
the people, it looks like the best
chance yet and I think it will go
through. The size of the hotel con
templated is just right to suit the
needs at present. This will be great
ly in its favor, as the people of Co
lumbia will not feel that they are un
dertaking something too big to be a
success.
Major J. M. Ratlertoii I would be
awfully glad to see a new hotel here,
but at present I don't think it is in
sight. I am not well enough posted
on the subject, and what lias been
done, to express myself.
Dr. Robert 31. Burgees dentist I am
glad we are going to have a Iiotel and
I don't think we shall have any trou
ble in getting it, but I do not like the
location. This town will never be any
larger than 25,000, if that large, and
what we need is, not a hotel perched
right on the pavement on Broadway,
but a large, homelike hotel with a
nice, big yard in front, where men can
spend their time after business. If
we are going to spend $100,000 on a
hotel, we ought to have one that will
make people want to stay here over
Sunday, instead of wanting to run
away as soon as a train will take them
out of town. However, there are lots
of things to say about a hotel.
C. II. Hoyt, traveling salesman for
the Westlnghouse Lamp Company, St.
Louis Columbia has ample room for
two first-class hotels. Competition al-
ways makes for better conditions. The
hotels would become more progressive,
and all would benefit in the long run.
Columbia would then probably be what
is called a "Sunday town"; traveling
men would rest up here after their
week's work, and incidentally spend
money in the place.
J. '. Fellows, contractor I am
heartily in favor of the building of a
new hotel in Columbia. The large
amount of , transient t-ade that is
drawn to Columbia an,d the many
persons that are attracted here
through the University make the need
of a hotel a great one.
E. G. Rails, city councilman Every
farmer that I have talked to is much
in favor of the new hotel. The hotel
is the first consideration; the location
is a secondary matter.
W. T. Andcr-on, Boone County Mill
ing and Elevator Company The new
hotel is something in which you will
find everyone 'n Columbia interested,
and something which the town needs
badly. But it must be a good one.
one that will be a source of pride to
the city as well as meet with the ap
provel of outsiders
L. T. Searcy, lawyei One of Co
lumbia's greatest needs is more hotel
accommodations. During conventions
and other "big days" the best adver
tisement we can have is a large hotel
to comfortably house the visitors.
J. R. Campbell, book denied Ther.
is no doubt that wo need a good hotel
in Columbia and I would surely like
to see one put up.
W. P. Keller, representative or tho
Union Iron Works Company, Spring
field, Mo., and member of the Missouri,
Kansas and Oklahoma Hote,! Men's As
sociation This town needs another
hotel for several reasons. Take the
matter of civic advertising for in
stance. Kansas City is making a name
for itself by holding at least one con
vention every three days. Columbia
should be a convention town, but under
present conditions that is impossible.
I know personally that the place has
been suggested several times for such
gatherings, but the lack of hotel fa
cilities has always caused the idea to
be abandoned.
L. W. llerry, grocer We ned a good
Iiotel here, there is no doubt about it,
and I think this is the opportune time
to get it. This looks like a good
proposition. I don't think we would
get another good opportunity like this
in the next five years.
.Marshall Gordon, dairy proprie'or
The plan is a good one and worthy
of the support of the business men
The location selectee! is good, being on
Broadway In the business center and
equally distant from the two stations.
The fact that it will occupy the entire
building instead of renting out the
ground floor space to small business
concerns Is a recommendation. This
hotel will be as good as tho business
of Columbia justifies.
M. R. Co ii ley, lawyer There is no
town In the state that needs a good
hotel more than Columbia. The best
place would be on Ilroadway, as the
many motorists to the city come In on
J that street.
II. t. Lenis-, represenative of the
National Refining Company, Cleveland,
Ohio Columbia is much better than
its hotel service and anything that
seems likely to remedy this defect
should be welcome. Outsiders judge a
place quickly by the accommodations
it affords them, and thus many get a
false impression of Columbia. This is
a thoroughly progressive town, and
the class of its citizens dpmands bet
ter hotels. Probably a new one would
increase the efficiency of the rest, and
all would profit.
31. I". Aslmry, traveling salesman
for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Com
panyit's a good thing. The town
needs more up-to-date hotels. This is
the largest city in the state with but
one first-class place at which to stop.
That's not a good reputation to have.
If Columbia ever gets on an electric
road, another hotel will be a necessity.
AGGIES LOSE TWICE
Nebraska Defeats Manhattan
Team by One Point in
Each Game.
The Kansas Aggies' Basketball team
met defeat for the first time this sea
son Friday and last night when they
dropped two games to Nebraska Uni
versity, the Cornhuskers winning by
one point in each contest. The score
Friday r.ight was 21 to 20 and last
night was 26 to 25. The games were
played at Lincoln.
The result of the series puts the
Ccrnhuskers in the lead for the Mis
souri Valley Conference title and
probably means that the Lincoln team
will go through the season without a
defeat.
Lowman's team had a chance to tie
the score in the last few minutes of
play last night, but failed at a free
throw.

of promise suit for $10,000 against
Kirtlcy Williams, who it is said, lives
near Riggs.
The petition claims that the defend

marry the plaintiff. It further says
that the defendant married Mtss Ha
Mae Brecdlove, February 5, 191C, and
therefore cannot marry the plaintiff.

MISSOI'HI'S STANDARD ADOPTED
Leading Medical Schools to Hate Tho.
Year Entrance Requirement.
Medical schools which are members
of the American Association of Medical
Colleges must require two years of
college work as a requisite for ad
mission to the medical course after
January 1, 1917. This is a new rule
of the association, adopted at a meet
ing in Chicago a few days ago.
Dr. G. I- Xoyes attended the meet
ing as representative of the University
of Missouri, which is a member of the
association. The new rule will bene
fit the society, in the opinion of Doctor
Xoyes, by raising the standard of
schools which are members.
Missouri has been following this
rule for six years.

ous, In tlie opinion or Dr. uuy l..
Xoyes, superintendent of the hospital.
"We always find that Short Course
students are more susceptible to dis
ease than regular students," said Dr.
Xoyes. "This is probably due to the
fact that most of them lead active lives
at home and when they change to a
sedentary life, with a different diet
and living condidtions they become
an easier prey to sickness."
FIREMEN'S HALL FOR EVERYONE
Chief E. N. Kurtz Wants to Sec M. U.
Students at Annual D.ince.
"This is not going to be a dress-suit
affair," said Chief E. N. Kurtz, refer
ring to the firemen's annual ball, to
be given February 22, "nor is it go
ing to be a 'rough-neck' affair. We
want all our friends to come."
Mr. Kurtz believe-; in social inter
course between the citizens of Colum
bia and the University students and
says that he hopes to see more stu
dents at the ball this year than last.
The firemen have been busy the last
month planning for their dance.
Speaking about the details of the af
fair, they say, "That's a secret, and
only those who attend will know."

29 PRINTERS ARE OUT
H. M. Craig Buys Stock in
Herald-Statesman and Re
turns as Superintendent.
While tho issue between the strik
ing printers and the employers re
mains tlie same, (he situation was
slightly altered yesterday by two de
elopments. These were:
II. M. Craig, who was foreman of
the Herald-S.atesman plant until the
strike Friday afternoon, purchased a
block of stock in the publishing com
pany and returned to the plant as su
perintendent. Mr. Craig came here
about a year ago from Ottawa, Kan.
The other development came at 3:30
o'clock in the afternoon when the Co
lumbia Daily Times signed the new
contract asked by the local typograph
ical union. 15. F. Roster is reinstated
as foreman and Jess Roberts returns
on condition. Velton Todd, former
linotype operator for the Herald
Statesman, takes the place of Arthur
Burton at the linotype machine. The
Times' pressman remains, as he was
not affected by the strike.
Two Women Out.
Twenty-nine union printers from the
oilice of the Stephens Publishing
Company and the Herald-S'.atesman
arc still on strike. Included In this
number are six students and two wom
en, Miss Virgie Campbell, for many
years a linotype operator at the
Stephens plan;, and Mrs. Carrie Her
ring, a proofreader in the same of
fice. As told in the Mlssourian Friday,
linotype men, floor men and union
proof-readers were called out. Bind
ers and pressmen are not affected. The
dispute has to do with wages and with
working conditions in the allices. A
graduated increase in pay extending
over five years was asked by the print
ers as the basis of a new contract with
tlie union. The Columbia Tribune and
the Columbia Printing Company
signed the new contract and were
therefore not affected by the strike.
First Printers' Strike.
The strike is the first printers' strike
in the history of Columbia and one of
the few labor disputes of any kind.
Under the rules of the union, striking
printers, while unemployed, are entit
led to weekly benefits, ?7 for married
men and $5 for unmarried men.
The Missourian has no connection
with the strike. This paper is af
fected only insofar as the paper is
printed under a year contract by the
Herald Statesman pompany, whose
shop was one of those against which
the strike order was directed.
