fire at the Caatnor Electrolytic plant
at the Falls, coupled with troop
movements to guard against possible

prehension today.
At the same time the Canadian
censor wired newspapers In Canada
not to print news or troop move

Buffalo constructors and employes.

Washington, Feb. 12. With the
possible arrival today of the Austro
German notices of intent to torpedo
armed merchant vessels without
warning, the American government
faced one ot the most serious and in
tricate questions since the war
started.
Indications are that Secretary ot
State Lansing will admit the sound
ness ot the foundation on which the
Teutons have built their contention
that arming merchant ships makes
the usual visit and search Impossible
before attack by submarines.
Such an agreement with the Teu
ton notes would be followed by a
warning to Americans not to travel
on armed merchantmen,
Meanwhile allied diplomats are be
ginning to feel that if the United
States acqulosces in a change ot rules
concerning armament while the war
Is In progress, It would be only a
short step to a change of view that
would result In placing an embargo
on munitions traffic.
Tho United States has held such
trndo logal and neutral, but the allies
sitirsrest that a modification ot the
submarine policy may forecast a mo'
dlflcatlon of the munitions policy,
too.
A government official admitted to
day he la considering the possibility

Rome, Feb. 12. The lost gap in
the allies' economic boycott of the
central powers was closed today by
Issuance of an Italian decree forbid
ding, under heavy penalty, the Im
portation of any Austro-German
goods .
This step waa announced after
Premier Brland had held several
hours' conference with the foreign
office.
"We have completed the steel wall
around Germany," Brland said In dis
cussing the embargo.
Ordinarily such a step would have
provoked an immediate declaration
of war. but it Is not believed here
that Germany cares to enroll Italy
among her open enemies, both tor
financial and military reasons.
Brland said that the allies are de
termined to throttle the Teutons
from an economic standpoint, while
making them suffer from a military
standpoint.

Experts are testing the soup by

An Independent test by City Health
Commissioner Robertson disclosed

"I am convinced that the case
might have been a plot against the
archbishop and his guests," said Col
lins. "Though I am not certain
about it, things look suspicious."

guests to secure Immediate medical
examination, although none was in a

Penfield cabled that he had received

Washington, Feb. 12. From the
cleared legislative situation result
ing from the letters passed between
President Wilson and his former sec
retary of war, and because ot con
ferences ot leaders since the secre
tary resigned, the following prepared
ness program was predicted today:
No continental army plan, as Sec
retary Garrison advocated.
Instead, substitution of a militia
clan under federal control, with
drafting regulations In case of war.
No compulsory training measures
not even the plan put forward by
Chairman Chamberlain of the senate
military committee.
In addition to this preparedness
program the Philippine Independence
bill probably will be a compromise,
with a pledge for ultimate hut dis
tant Independence.
The first step in this direction came
today when it became known that the
house military committee will sug
gest a ten-year period within which
freedom shall he given the Islands.

the Bank of Montreal, at New West

Those arrested were Edward Leon

motorman, and Michael Flonnlgan, a
saloonkeeper, with their wives. Mrs.
Leonard is said to be the "brains"
of the gang, and part of the stolen
stamps were found under her floor.
Letters taken from the prisoners

the St. .Paul affair.'
The similarity of the two. Indeed,
cause authorities to suspect Flannl

New Westminster case, though de

part in passing the funds taken there.

Exhaustion, and That U.S.
Has No Lasting Friendships
Washington, Feb. 12. Aa idee,
that Germany's animosity toward the
United States because of our ammu
nition sales to the allies will inverse
ly assure us the lasting friendship ,
of the allies is erroneous, in the opin
ion of two American newspapermen.
who are in a position to know.
Ed L. Keen, general European
manager of the United Press, with
headquarters in London, and William
Philip Simms, manager of the Paris
bureau of the United Press, back in
this country on short vexations, met
here today prior to their return to
Europe.
The outstanding Idea in the mind
ot each after a tew days of contact
with the American viewpoint, was
the extent to which Americans are
deceiving themselves on two points,
namely, the feeling of the people ot
France and England toward America
and the possibilities of aa early
peace. ';..': ;
Their views follow: "
- ; . ...": r By Ed EL Keea . :
-It 4n-irident that Jkinerfea,. mis
understands England almost as much
as England misunderstands America
in this war. .
"An American returning from Eng
land for the first time jslnce the war
started can not fail to he amazed at
the lack ot appreciation among his
fellow countrymen of the determina
tion ot the allies and particularly
that of England to push the war
relentlessly to a victorious conclu
sion at any cost and any sacrifice.
It Is like the surprise of the first time
traveler to Europe when he finds
that the people of the allied coun
tries are not overflowing with grati
tude for the material support given
by the United States munition
makers. '
"It may be a shock to some folk
on this side to learn how prevalent
throughout the allied countries and
especially in England is the Idea
that the only reason we are keeping;
out of the war is that we can make
more money by not coming in. It Is
not merely the anti-American news
papers that label us 'dollar chasers';
in official circles a more sympathetic
view Is taken, hut the public at large
i Is convinced Uncle Sam is prepared
to swallow 'any Insult to his honor
rather than relinquish this unprece
dented opportunity of lining his
pockets with European gold. They
do not hate us exactly. - The feeling
ranges rather from pity to contempt,
according to the individual.
"Such misapprehension of the
United States' attitude finds Its par
allel here. '.. .
" 'Arent the allies about ready to
quti 'Do they really think they
have a chance to win?'
"These questions are asked in all
quarters here. Rumors hate spread
broadcast that one or more of the
allies are seeking a separate peace;'
that any ot them would be willing to
listen now to terms less onerous than
thoy would hare Imposed a year ago, .
"I can state most positively that
so far as England is concerned peace
at present, at least, Is out of the ques
tion. ' This assertion Is (based not
only on the statements of cabinet
members and other publlo men, but
upon persistent inquiry among' the
common folk. The pro-peace element
In England is a negligible quantity, 1
confined to a few lrreoonclliables
who have opposed the wor from the
Btart and who are practically without
influeunce. '
