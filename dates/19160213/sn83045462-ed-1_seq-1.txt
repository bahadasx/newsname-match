LONDON, February u.?The
Champagne region in France,
where comparative quiet has pre\
ailed recently, while sanguinary
battles have been in progress in
the Artois and south, of the
Somme, has again been the scene
of bitter fighting, of which the
French have had the advantage.
After capturing about 300
yards of enemy trenches near
Butte de Mesnil, , the French
have been forced to undergo several
counter-attacks of severe
character, all of which have been
repulsed, according to Paris.
The fighting which is going on j
at many points is of intense char-1
acter. The latest French official
statement says:
Fail to Cross the Yser.
"In Belgium, after quite a violent
artillery preparation, the Germans several
times attempted to cross the Taer
at Het Sas. Under the combined fire
of our artillery and machine guns
these attempts failed.
"In Champagne there was very
marked artillery activity in the regions
of the Butte du Mesnil and
Xavarine. After a bombardment lasting
several hours the enemy was able
to penetrate a small salient of our
line between the road from Navarin
and that from Saint Souplet.
Germans Bepulsed.
"To the northeast of the Butte du
Mesnil the Germans attempted by a
new counter-attack to drive us from
those parts of the trench occupied by
us yesterday, but were repulsed. We
continued to progress by the use of
grenades to the east of these parts,
fcnd have made some prisoners.
"In the Argonne, near the Four de
Paris, we exploded a ramouflet, which
shattered the mine works of the enemy.
"In the v'osges to the north of Wis- I
' aenibach. eant of St. I?ie, an enemy at-I
tack met by our fire was not able to ap-'
proach our first line "
British Statement.
FJe!ati\e to the more recent fighting on
he western front the British official
statement of last night says:
"Marly this morning the enemy broke
into our trenches near Pilkelm, but was
driren out by bombing parties, leaving
some dead and wounded behind. This
afternoon the enemy made two small infantry
attacks about the Pilkelm road,
w bioh were repulsed.
I
Thcr<- has beer- mining a< tivity aboutj
Mullo'.h and north of the Ypres-Comines j
anal. At the latter place an under-j
ground fight took place, resulting In the j
enemy being driven bark, our miners j

German Aero Attack.
"The farts of the German aeroplane
attack described ?n a German wireless
report on Tuesday are as follows:
Kleven hostile machines appeared. One
machine dropped three bombs about
six miles behind our front line. It was
driven down by two of our machines
crossing the line at 500 feet. The remainder
of the machines did not face
our patrols, no* did they cross the
line."
On Tuesday German army headquarters
reported an attack by a German
air squadron on the railroad station at
Poperingne, Belgium, and on British
amps between Poperlnghe and I>ix- ude.
Tne German airmen had several
c jrnbats with hostile aeroplanes, according

that they could not go on record as i

sentful of the campaign of tel*?graphln

that the railroad employers and en

REACHES NEWPORT .NEWS
K TOO LATE FOR LAUNCHING
y Accepted Invitation, But Biggest Oil
Steamer in World Had Left
the Ways.
I NEWPORT NEWS. Va.. February 12 ?
! President Wilson this afternoon personally
inspected one unit of the country's
defense, when he made a tour
of Fortress Monroe, whose mammoth
guns guard tlfe entrance to Chesapeake
bay. ten miles away. Cutting short his
j inspection of the fort, when he received
an invitation to attend the launching
of the largest oil steamer ever
built in America, the President hurriedly
returned to his launch and headed
for the plant of the Newport News
Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.
But before his speedy little craft
could cover the twelve miles the giant
hull of the Charles Pratt, building for
;r the Standard Oil Company, had taken
its maiden plunge in the water of the
S' James, and the presidential party had
II to satisfy itself with a view of the ship?
building plant and other interesting spots
along the shores of the James and Hampit
ton roads between Old Point and Newport
News.
j Pleasant Trip Down Potomac.
d ! The naval yacht Mayflower, with the
j President and Mrs. Wilson and Dr.
| Cary T. Grayson, the President's phy- i
'* j sician. aboard, arrived in Hampton
? I roads about 1:30 p.m., after a delight- j
ie ful trip down the Potomac river and j
l_ Chesapeake bay. The Mayflower did j
not fly the President's flag, and there j
l" were no salutes from the fort or other
formal ceremonies to mark the chief
il executive's arrival in Virginia waters.
5& It was stated at Old Point this afternoon
that the presidential party would
remain in Hampton roads district ujitil
P 5:30 o'clock Sunday afternoon, when
s the return trip to Washington will be
begun.
i- Accompanied by Mrs. Wilson, Dr.
Grayson and two secret service men,
ir the President came ashore a few miny
utes after six o'clock. A number of
soidiers from the fort and civilians
-r who were gathered on the dock greett
ed the President with rousing cheers,
to which he responded by lifting his
n hat and bowing, a broad smile indicat-'
ing his pleasure at the impromptu reB>
ception. The presidential party then
neadea tor tne main entrance iu me
fort. En route the President was
stopped by several men who knew him
and wfcs forced to acknowledge the
demonstrative greeting every few
steps. Each time he lifted his hat
>- and bowed with a smile.
Waives All Formalities.
y Beaching the fort, the President
tt stopped at the guardhouse and asked
in the guard on duty to request the ofle
fleer of the day to notify the fort auw
thorities that he did not desire that
c- any formal courtesies be shown him;
o that with his wife and Dr. Grayson
n- he would see the fort without escort.
;s The party then walked through the
main barracks, circled the parade
^ ground, looking the barracks over
,n from the outside, and then mounted
n the ramparts of Battery Parrott, where
the President inspected with a show
d of deep interest the twelve-inch guns.
i_ which in time of war will be called
,e upon to keep hostile ships out of the
8> waterways which lead to Washington,
Baltimore, Newport News, Bichmond
e and-Norfolk. /
|J It was while on the ramparts thdt
" the President received the invitation
Ll to attend the launching, the messenger
explaining that the exercises would be
delayed if the President should accept
} the invitation. Mr. Wilson men led
,j the way down the barracks and breakwater,
making: the exit from the fort
le | through the officers' quarters. Fully
:d | two hundred persons bad gathered on
|Q ! the pier and a volley of handclap!
ping and cheers greeted the nation's
18 | chief executive. The greeting again
?r was cordially acknowledged.
|| Courtesy of the Sailors.
In During the President's absence the
^ sailors In charge of the launch from
n the Mayflower had gathered some
white boards out of which they had
(e~ constructed a temporary platform at
ie the point the party would board the
a launch. The President seemed greatly
|c pleased by this show of sentiment and
? Mrs. "Wilson smiled and bowed her
?y thanks to the sailors,
al The launch was headed for Newport
>d News with all speed, but if they had
y only known it, the launching had alii
ready taken place, the start from Old
Point being made at 4:10 and the
?n launching having occurred at 4 o'clock,
ie The trip was not entirely without sata.1
isfactory result, however, as the Presi,d
dent was afforded an opportunity to
n look over the superdreadnaught Pennf
sylvania, which is nearing completion
and expected to go on her trial trip
during the latter part of this month,
and the Mississippi, to be slightly larger
er than the Pennsylvania, and which
;c| is now about 30 per cent completed.
To Visit Soldiers' Home.
!? Tomorrow President and Mrs. Wilson
la are expected to visit the National Sol5e
diers' Home and the Hampton Normal
School atvHampton. Their plans have
t not been made public, however, and it
?n i? not definitely known how they will
e. upend the Sabbath. They will spend the
night aboard the Mayflower, which
3f1 rides at anchor in practically the same
,e spot where the captured British liner
ur Appant dropped anchor after being
? brought into Hampton roads by a German
prize crew ten days ago.
.n Returning; to Old Point from Newport
ie News, the President and party went dilv
rectly to the Mayflower, not touching
at the dock. The President later declined

No messages reached the White
House yesterday from President Wil- p
son. cruising in the Chesapeake on the F
Mayflower, and officials said if he had n
reached any conclusion in his consid- v
eration of a successor to Secretary Gar- b
rison they had no knowledge of it. Tt u
was said the President left the capital C
Friday night with an open mind, ex- i<
pecting during his trip to give careful o
consideration to each of the long list t
of candidates suggested to him. s
Several in High Official CTircles. "
Among many of those familiar with y
the President's views the impression
prevails that unless he goes outside of
high official circles for a War Secretary
he will name Franklin K. Lane, ?
now Secretary of the Interior. Others be- ^
lieve that of those already associated n
officially with the administration. Sec- n
retary Houston of the Agricultural Department,
Assistant Secretary Itooseveil
of the Navy and Counselor I'oik of
the State Department all are being
very seriously considered by th? President.
There would be little surprise here, S
however, if the choice fell upon some
man outside official circles and not
publicly discussed for the place. The s
President's mind, White House offi- rr
cials believe, virtually will be made up w
when he returns here late today or to- a
morrow. h
Gets Stronger Support.
In letters and other messages reaching
the White House yesterday from c
members of Congress, officials profess- f<
ed to see a decided tendency among S
those who had opposed Secretary Car
rlson's ?ntal army plan to sup- |
port O $dent on a compromise I

would support the President, among

Republicans and Democrats
Alike Discuss Chances of
His Nomination.
How far will the movement to nomilate
Col. Roosevelt on the republican
icket go?
The question was discussed yesterlay
at the Capitol by republicans and
emocrats alike. The announcement
y Representative Gardner and three
ther well known citizens of Massahusetts
that they wanted Roosevelt
or the nominee of the party preciptated
the discussion. A report from
llinois to the effect that three of the
andidates for delegate to the national
epublican convention in that state had
ome out for Roosevelt added to the
nterest.
Here are some of the opinions -exressed
by senators and representatives
egarding the matter, who, however,
aid they did not care to have their
anios used in connection with the
tatemcnts.
How Situation Is Viewed.
That Hie Roosevelt movement in
lassachusetts is the result of the
trife there over candidates for the
omination and an attempt to climiate
Senator Weeks from the running.
That the announcement in Massahusetts
and Illinois regarding Rooseclt
are only the forerunners of a
weeping campaign which will carry
toosevelt into the nomination against
11 opposition.
That these announcements are inended
to feel out the country and paricularly
the republicans in regard to 1
fie possible nomination of Roosevelt. 1
A republican senator from the west '
airl that hf thorp was a nna.
Ibiiity, even a probability, of Roose- 1
elt's receiving the republican nomi- 1
ation. He added that if he did the
uestion in which the nation is most
itally interested would then become
le issue in the national campaign? 5
hether the United States is prepared
) protect its citizens.
Fear Roosevelt Nomination.
i
Other republicans in the Senate take <
le stand that to nominate Roosevelt
ould be playing into the hands of the (
emocrats and would bring about a j
jndition which the democrats are (
oping for?a division in the ranks of t
le republicans?and also would align J
le peace element of the country f
gainst the republican nominee. They j
re fearful, too. that Col. Roosevelt's
lything but neutral utterances in reard
to Germany and Austria would
>se him the entire vote of citizens of <
eutonic extraction in this country. '
It was recalled that reports stated ''
oosevelt would not accept a nomina- <
on for the presidency which meant a ?
;ht within the republican party, since
ich a fight might mean the victory
' the present administration. ,
Snmp nt th#? democrats at the Canltol
ere announcing that their predictions
n'cerning the nomination of Roose?lt
by the republicans were being upsld.
and some of them apparently
ere glad that this was so.

It is believed in military circles that
the new Russian offensive has prevented
the Germans from withdrawing;
troops from this front, thereby lessening
the chances of successful attacks
on all lines elsewhere.
The initiative on the Dvinsk front
remains in German hands, but the mild
weather of the last month, threatening
with inundation the trenches built by
the Germans on marshy grounds, is
seriously handicapping their effort to
move forward. Prisoners report that
a great number of French prisoners are
employed in the construction of drainage
works.

did not reach London in their raid on
the night of January 31. according to
passengers from England who arrived
here tonight on the White Star liner
Adriatic. There were reports in the
British capital, however, that 179 persons
were killed and nearly 300 wounded
in the midland districts not far
from London by bombs dropped from
the German airships.
George T. Knowles, chairman of the
American University Club of Liverpool,
who was on the Adriatic, was in London
the night of the raid and declared
the Zeppelins bombarded neither that
city nor Manchester. Considerable damage
was done, however, at Burton-onTrent,
he said. He visited that place
and saw the ruins of a large brewery
which had been burned. Bombs were
dropped also in Nottingham. The misjiles
evidently were aimed. Mr. Knowles
asserted, at large buildings in the hope
that arsenals might be struck.

:he raiders did not visit Bondon on the
light of the 31st.
