FORCES CUT AS

Authorities at Washington,.. Take
Advantage of Hibh State of Ef
' ficiency at Omaha Postoffice.'
SURPLUS IS USED ELSEWHERE
Every little while the Omaha post
office gets boquets as a model of
efficiency, compared with other
offices, but it is a surprising fact
that the authorities at Washington
seem to have taken advantage of this
high state of efficiency to cut the
force of clerks and carriers "all the
traffic will bear," and the surplus
earnings of the Omaha office goes
to keep up other parts of the postal
service where there is a deficit,
Out ot every three donarsre
ceived at the Omaha postoffice two
are sent to. Washington, and only
one dollar is kept here; to pay the.
expenses of running the office. ?
During the first six months of
1614 the gross receipts ot the Omaha
office were $692,5"9.91end during
the last six months 'of' 1 H5 Hby
were $ 1 an' increase of
$78,785.47, or morethan 11 per

suggesting that armed merchant

the State department declined to dis

It U considered doubtful that tha exact

texts of the notes from Germany and
Austria handed to Ambassadors Gerard

not fair to say at this time that the views
of the Vnlted Htntea on armed merchant
