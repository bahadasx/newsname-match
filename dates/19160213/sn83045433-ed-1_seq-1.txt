Dismembering Policies
There Is the policy of dismembering
Germany by detaching Bohemia as an
independent national state, of detaching
Poland from our ally, Russia, similarly,
and of dismembering Austria by giving
Bosnia and Herzgovlna to Serbia and
of splitting the dual monarchy into two
single republics tfor there Is really no
use In setting up new states if they are
all to have thrones occupied by Hochnxoi
