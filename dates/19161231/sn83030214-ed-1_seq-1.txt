Hold Germany's Word Worthless
The '?

ha\e shown by their a<-ts their attachment to peace.
Trat attachment is a? strong- to-day a* it was in
But it is not upon the word of (?ermany,
lifter the violation of its engapement?. th;.
peace broken by her may be based.
\ mere suggestion, without a statement of
terms, thi ihould be opened ia not
a- olTei of peace. The putting forward by the
m pera! eovernment of a sham proposal lacking
ibatance and precision would appear to be
an offer of peace than a war man?uvre. It il
founded on calec?ate?! misinterpretation of the
character of the struggle in the pa?t. the presen?
and the future.
*.?'? . the Gerona** note take* no
acc'iiint of th' ? ,- irei which estab
'?sh tha* the war wai de i ed, provoked and declared
? 'erman* an H unfai :?,
\t the Hue le ( 01 ference it was a German liele
?-ats who refused ail proposals for disarmament.
In July, 1914, it was \u?tria Hungary, who, after
having addressed to Serbia an unprecedented ulti?
matum. .Inland \*ar upon her in spite of th?
??("action which had at once been aeisordc :
Rejected All Peace Efforti in 1914
The < entra! Empires 'hen rejected aii attempt!
made by the F.ntente to bring about a pacific solu
ti? of ;. purely local conflict. Greal Britain ig
ed a confer? nee; Prance propo ed an interna?
tional commission; th<- Emperor of Russia asked
the (?erman Kmpcror to go to arbitration, and
Russia an?! \ u-tna-Hungary came to an under
Standing on the eve of the conflict. But to all
these efforts Germany gaye neither answer nor
effect.
Belgium ? ? m pi re which had
guaranteed her neutrality and which had the as
surance to proclaim that treatiei were " rap of
paper" and that "necessity knows no law."
At the present moment these sham offf'
the part of (?ermany rest on th?' war map of r'urope
alone, which represents nothinp more than ;; super?
ficial ami ,'hnse of the situation, anr not
? ? , ? -th of the belligerents, A peace con?
cluded upon these terms would bo only to the ad
vantape of the aggressors, who. alter imapininp
that they would reach their poal in two months,
discovered -fter two yean thai they could never
attain i*.
Demand Penalties, Reparation, Guarantees
A? for the future, the disaster? enured i.y the
i.prmaii declaration of war and the innumerable
outrages committed by Germany and her allies
against both helliperent S and neutral? demand pen
allies, reparation and guarantees. '.? rrnany avoids
mention of any of the??.
b reality, these overtures made by the Central
Tower?; are nothing more than a cal ttempt
to influence the future courte of the war end to
' it by imposinp a (?erman peace. The
of these overtures is to create dissension in public
i,pinion in the Allied countries. But that public
opinion has, in spite of all the :>? ? duredb,
the Alue-, already piven its answer with admirable
firmness, and lias denounced the empty pretence of
the declaration of the enemy powers.
They have the further object of stiffening public
? ?pinion in Germany end in the countries allied to
her one and all leverely tried by their lot ?es, worn
by economic pr(??sure and crushed by the su
nrenic effort which ha- been imposed upon their in
'utils.
Reject Empty and Insincere Offer
They endeavor to deceive end intimid?t?
opinion in neutral countrie . whose mhahitan's
have lonp since made up their minds where the
initial responsibilities lie, and are far too enlight?
ened to favor the designs of Germany by abi
inp the defence of human freedom.
Finally, the.-e overture*- attempt to justify in a?l
vance in the eyes of the world a new ?-.?ries of
crime* submarine warfare, deportations, forced
tbor and forced enlistment of the inhabitants
??gainst their own countries and \iolations of neu
trality.
Pally ranecioui of the ?gravity of thii moi ?
bul equally conscious of it? requirements, the Allied
governments, closely united to one another and in
perfect sympathy with their peoples, refuse to ?'on
?ider a proposal which is empty and iniincen
Once apain the Allies declare that no peace i
pottible so lonp as they have not Secured repara?
tion for violate?! riplits, and liberties, the rec
lion of the principle of nationalities and of the free
U nee of small states; so lonp as they have not
ighl about ? lettlemenl calculated to end once
and for all forces which have constituted ? per
pe*u;i| menace to the nation- and to afford the only
effective guarantee for the future security of the
'.vo rid.
In conclusion, the Allied "towers th ? - , necei
?rward the followinp considera' I
which show 'he ipecial situation of Heipium after
I war. In \ irtue of the in
real H ligned by Rvs preat Kuropean

Belgium has always ilouslj fulfilled its
h her neutrality imposed upon her. she
up arms t?> defend her independence and
her neutrality violated by (?ermany and t?i show
? ??mains faithf?j 1 to her international obli
ons.
Must Restore and Indemnify Nation
the fourth of August, 1914, in the Reichs
tag, the (?erman Chancellor admitted that this ag
gression constitu ed an injustice contrary to the
- of nations, and pledged himself in the name
of Germany t? repair it. During two and a half
years thi? injustice ha- been cruelly aggravated by
pro**eedingi of the occupyinp forces, which
have exhausted the re-ourc?< of the country, ruined
industries, devastated its towns and villages
have been responsible for innumerable mas?
acres, executions and imprisonments.
At thi.-. very moment, while Germany is pro
-i ing peace and humanity to the world, she is
deporting Belgian citizens by thousands and retluc
? m to slavery.
,m, before the war, asked for nothinp but
to live in harmony with her neighbors. Her King
m d her povernment have but one aim?the re
? tablishment of peace and justice. Rut they only
desire, pence which would assure to the country
legitimate reparation, guarantees and safeguard1
for the future.
