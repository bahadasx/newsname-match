WILSON NOJE ECHOED
Scandinavian 8oclal Demoorati In

HERLIN (via Sayvllle wireless), Dec
31. Announcing delivery of Sweden's
pcaco note to the Qerman foreign office,
the Press Uureau tonight made public
the following telegram sent President
Wilson by tho Norwegian Working
men's Association: .
"Tho Norwegian Social Democracy
which dominates third of the Norweg
ian electors, sends srsstnt to the Presi
dent' energetic work for the termina
tion of war' bajarlin and for the
establishment of lasting peace."
Tho Danish Social Democracy also
sent the following message:
'We beg to express smpathy with
your note of peace and express our
most ardent wish that your endeavors
for termination of tho world's war and
establishment of lasting peace will be
crowned by success."
Masons given by Allies
.for refusal to talk peace
"A mere suggestion without a statement of terms, that
negotiations' should bo opened, is not an offer of peace Tho
putting forward by the imperial government of a sham pro
posal, lacking all substance and precision, would appear to
bo less' nn offer of peace than a war maneuver.
"At the present moment theea sham offers on the part
of Germany rest on tho War map of Europe alone, which
represents nothing more than a superficial and passing
phase of the situation and not the real strength of the bel
ligerents. "A peace concluded jipon these terms would be only to
tho advantage of the aggressors; who, after imagining that
they would reach their goal in tvfomoiuhs, discovered af.ter
two years that they could neverottain it. - '
"The innumerable outrages committed by Germany and
her allies against both belligerents and neutrals demand
penalties, reparation and guarantees! Germany avoids men
tion of anyof these.
' . .
"The,object of these overtures is to create dissension in
public opinion in the allied countries.
"They have the further object of stiffening public
opinion in Germany and in the countries allied to herone
and all severely tried by their losses, worn out by economic
pressure, and crushed by the supreme effort which has been
imposed upon their inhabitants.
"Finally, these overtures attempt to justify in advance
in the eyes of the world a new scries of crimes submarine
warfare, deportations, forced labor and forced enlintment
of the inhabitants against their own countries and violations
of neutrality." ,

er In delivering the note.
Three Different Views.
Three different vlowa were expiess
d In official circles with reference tn
the effect of the allies' rejection 5(
tlermsny's peace proffer.
Administration officials, who aided
the President In hi move for peace,
refused to accept thn alllesreplfc.!,.,
final re lectlo'n of ""price vsrturr
Their view was that hopes of "earl
peace liad diminished, but had not
disappeared.
The Gorman embassy expressed th
unofficial opinion that the prospect
In the peacn situation ate "hopeful.'
since the allies' reply contains a loop
hole that might make possible the
continuation of negotiations.
Other officials, not so Intimate
concerned with the negotiations, could
sen little ground for hope In the bit
tor tono of thn allle' reply, which
branded flermany' proposal
"empty and Insincere," and a "less an
offer of peaco than a war maneuver."
Discouraging Factor.
Another discouraging factor w
thn disclosure that President Wilson
had made efforts to obtain thn sup
port of other neutrals In niovlng for
peace, and had been only partls.ll'
successful.
First disclosure that the President
had sent another note to neutral na
tlons, supplementing the recant note
to belligerents, was made when the
text of Spain's refusal to act with
the United States, msdr public In
Madrid, made reference to having re
ceived such a note, asking Spain to
support the United State.
State Department officials, taking
advantage of the present policy or
silence, refused to discuss this second
note, but It waa accepted aa certain
that the United States had made a
move to enlist the aid of alt other .
neutrals.
Explains AetU.
This disclosure, by the v.a, ex
plains why Immediately following thr
publication of President Wilson's
note, the view of the other neutral
nations on the subject of peace were
mndn known,
The effort hitherto has been mad-t
to explain this awa as coincidence,
but it now develops as having been
a response to President Wilson's In
Illative.
Tim apparent faUurn of ths plan
to solidify neutral opinion In support
of President Wilson's effort to draw
out peace terms from belllgrents, his
proved a disappointing factor.
Sullserland, of all tlm neutrals, was
thn only ono which offeieil unquall
lied support to the President. The
Swiss reply offeied .to help In any
way "nq matter how modest."
No Direct Offer.
The Scandinavian countries "ex
pressed .profound sympathy for thr
peaco effoits and "hoped the Inl
tln of President Wilson" will have
a suecesfiil lesult. These govern
ments, however, made no direct offei
of co-operation.
Spain, In her reply, received at thr
State Department during the night,
said that "while the desires of thn
American Government are worthy,"
thn Spanish government will "suspend
all sctlon until thn time when her ef
forts and work In favor qf peace can
bo morn useful and efficacious than
at the? piesent time."
Holland and tho South American
naturals made no reply whatever to
the peacn proposals, or at least no
admislon of such rep.ly has been made.
Our liar of Hope.
The one ray of hops seen In the
otherwise bitter tone. of the- alt!
reply was the paragraph which was
accepted by German emuassy officials
as a "loophole" for further discussion.
The "loophole' referred to readj:
"After the violations (by the cen
tral powers) and their engagement la.
war they (the allies) cannot end th
war at Grmany'a suggestion without
