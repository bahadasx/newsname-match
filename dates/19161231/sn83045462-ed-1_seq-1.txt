collectively to the pretended propositions
of peace which were addressed
to them on behalf of the enemy
governments through the intermediary
of the I'nited States, Spain,
Switzerland and Holland. Before
making: any reply the allied powers
desire particularly to protest against
the two essential assertions of the
note of the enemy powers that pretend
to throw upon the allies responsibility
for the war and proclaim
the victory of the central
powers.
"The allied governments cannot
admit an affirmation doubly inexact
and which suffices to render sterile
all tentative negotiation. The allied
nations have sustained for thirty
months a war they did everything to
avoid. They have shown by their
acts their attachment to peace. That
attachment is as strong today as it
was In 1914. Hat it Is aot upon the

"Belgium was invaded by an empire

government pilot licenses arrived at
the Philadelphia navy yard, completing
the flight of 165 miles in less than two
f hours. Two of the aviators who failed
to reach this city were compelled to
descend because of motor trouble near
Monmouth Junction, N. J., and one at
Deans, near that place. Engine trouble
caused one of the squad to abandon
* the flight ten miles from Hempstead.

BOSTON, December 30.?In response
to a telegram from-Representativc Robert
L?. Henry of Texas urging that he
go to Washington immediately and produce
any facts he may have bearing on
a "leak" from the State Department to
Wall street in connection with President
Wilson's recent peace note, Thomas
W. Dawson today replied by wire that
he would call on the representative
Monday.
"You have libeled congressmen and
public officials ami I orj^dict yQi^ cannot

Stated in the teftegIfem which 3fr. Lawson
made public here today? Tt was explained
that Mr. Henry made his request
in his capacity as a member of
the House rules committee, of which he
is chairman.
Lawson Announces Intentions.
"The good old Capitol has been wallowing
in Wall street leak grafts for
forty years." the Lawson reply said.
"You and Congressman Wood started
this 'leak* merry-go-round, then you
sort of run me into it through your press
statements, and then you made me the
whole of it. Now I say, congressman,
have a heart, have, a heart.
"This is my program: Tomorrow I
will give you a serious 3,000-word bit.
then, if you wish, 1 will visit you on
New Year day. then on Tuesday from
the gallery 1 will listen to you and the
other statesmen who missed out on the
'leal:' lambast me some more*."
MAY DEOP "LEAK" CHARGE
Rules Committee Hot to Act Unless
Evidence Is Forthcoming.
"Unless Representative Wood or
Thomas W. I*awson comes forward with
some concrete evidence of a 'leak* in
connection with the President's peace
note, the rules committee will drop the
entire matter," said Representative
Henry, chairman of the committee last
night.
"I do not intend to call the committee
together merely for the sake of
hearing some wild rumors." continued
Mr. Henry. "But if Mr. Wood or Mr.
Uwson has actual facts in his possession
and can show them to me. then
some action will be taken. I think I
would recognize such facts if they were
shown to me."

ease his conscience," Rev. Peter J. O'Caliaghan,
now of Washington, D. C., formerly
of Chicago, told Gov. Dunne and
the state board of pardons here today he
lia^d been "haunted for eight years by the
belief that Herman Billik. who is serving
a life sentence in the Joliet penitentiary
for murder, is innocent."
Billik was sentenced to hang in 1907 for
the murder of Mary Vrzal. whose death
roUowed that of Ave other members of
her family, all as the result of poisoning.
Rev. O'Callaghan said that Jerry Vrzal,
only surviving member of the family,
then fourteen years old, had confessed to
him that he perjured himself at the trial
in which he was the principal witness
against Billik.

jection of the demand by the man- p;

"It is highly improbable that there
will be a strike Monday," Stone said.
He declared the'report that a cir- Vi

the authority to call a general strike, j w
was untrue. "No circular has yet been tl
prepared." he said. OJ
Stone said no further statement would aj
be forthcoming today in Cleveland, and ^
that there would be no meeting of the ty
brotherhood heads.
It was pointed out that a general a]
strike Monday was an impossibility, because
of the fact that the railroad t'

by Representative Hull
to Meet Extra Expense:
In a statement issued last nigh
epresentative Hull of Tennessee
ember of the ways and means com
ittee and framer of the Income ta
w and amendment, discussed the esti
ated receipts and revenues of th
vernment and pointed out the line c
marcation between the ordinary in
me and expense and the extraordin
y expenses to be incurred by the pol
y of preparedness. Mr. Hull urges
>r these extraordinary expenses,
ecial tax levy, so designated in th
w. for a period of three years. Th
atement follows:
'When reference is made to the re
ipts and expenditures of the federa
vernment the public understands i
mean 'ordinary' receipts and ex
nditures. The extent and reasonable
ss of taxes imposed and the amoun
money expended are judged by thi
andard. When new taxes to njee

th ordinary and extraordinary rev

PRESIDENT CONFERS
E ON RAILROAD BILLS
n Goes to Capitol and Discusses
Legislative Measures With
Senator Newlands.
T SEEKS TO SPEED PROGRAM
? President Wilson went to the Capitol
is late yesterday afternoon and conferred
f- with Senator Newlands. chairman of
ar 1 me ocnaie interstate commerce con*
of mittee, on the proposed railroad legit*
is! lative program. While Senator Newid
i lands declined to discuss what transpired
at the conference, it is understood
a- that the President is seeking to ex*
ed I pedite the passage of the proposed laws,
sd J particularly in view of the failure of
id the railroads and the brotherhoods to
s- agree on an application of the Adamson
er eight-hour law.
It is understood that the President is
anxious that the legislation be reported
out of the Senate interstate commerco
eommitee as quickly as possible and
>y that the Senate act upon it forthwith,
ts President Wilson has not kept in touoh
e_ with details of the negotiations between
the brotherhood representatives and the
railroads, but is understood to fear that
m the failure to reach an agreement may
. lead to a reopening of the entire controversy.
He feels that there has boon
to enough public discussion of the points at
Is issue to allow Congress to act promptly.
n~ President's Visit Unexpected.
?d The President's visit to the Capitol vaa
)r unexpected. It was taken as the first
^ step of the chief executive to hurry up
j_ congressional action. Rumors have been
le growing stronger and stronger the last
,d few days that little or no railroad legislation
could be expected at the present
session of Congress, and that the opposition
was strong to the President's pro?
. posal for a law making it unlawful to call
a strike or a lockout pending a thorough
r_ investigation by the government of tap
i- matters at issue.
- It has been said that unless the Preea
ident exerts all his influence with Con>n
gress. which has been shown to be very
i- great in the past, this bill has prac
tically no show of passing. The other
i measures which the President desires
- enacted provide for an enlargement of
'a the interstate commerce commission

take over and operate railroads and

ly After his .visit to Senator Newlands^
s. the President sought to locate Repre--h
sentative Adamson, who. has charge of

re learned that he had not returned to

to Senator Newlands. speaking of the railroad
situation renerallw Mid h? did nat
believe there was any immediate danger
J of a strike and that the railroad employee
would await the deliberate Judgment of
id I Congress regarding legislation on the subf.
ject.
"The attention of the country to the
to importance of legislation on this matter
s- has been drawn as never before, and. Is
,n my judgment, action of Congress will be
very decisive in so far as any attempt to
