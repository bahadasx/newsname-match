Bisbee to Become
First-class P. O.
During Coming Year
Biggest Quarter in the History
of Local Postoffice Closed
Yesterday 20,000 Pack
ages Handled in Few Days.
Arizona will have another first
class postoffice when the;--, new
rolls are put out during coming
year. Bisbee will be the name of
that office, and the growth of the
government's business in the
Warren District is merely another
criterion of the prosperity enjoy
vjea here during the year 1916.
Tn order for a noctrifficA tn mlal-
ify for the first class diyision, of
which there are but two at the
present time. Phoenix and Tuc
son, each quarter's receipts must
be $10,000 or over. For the last
four fluarters the Bisbee office,
which includes the brauch office
' in Lowell, has reported better
than the necessary sum.
1916's last quarter, ending De
cember 30, and including the
months of October, November and
December, contributes a total of
$12,417.56. It is the largest in the
history of the office. These re
ceipts include box rent and stamp
sales.
Postal savings in the Bisbee
offices have increased proportion
ately during the past year and
show some remarkable figures.
At the close of business Decem
ber 30. 1914, 586 depositors had
$111,738 in the local depository.
The average was $190.66 for each
man or woman having an account.
At the close of business, Decem
ber 31, 1915, 691 depositors had
$137,735, an average or $199.33
for each man or woman having
an account.
At the close of business yester
day. December 30. 1916, 912 men
and women had $265,610 on depos
it in the Bisbee office, an average
of $291.24 apiece.
December, as a usual thing,
means, for the postal savings de
partment, that more money is tak
en out than there is deposited.
This is due to the Christmas shop
ping in large part. Strange to
say, the Bisbee office showed a
gain in December. At the end of
November there was on deposit
- $254,483. Eighty seven accounts
were opened during the months of
December and sixty seven closed.
The increase during the month
amounted to $11,127, making the
total on deposit, as of yesterday,
total $265,610.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30. In
creasing evidence that General
Carranza's government is being
menaced by bandits, coupled with
the prcspect that the first chief
will not accept the Atlantic. City
protocol has brought the Mexican
situation to a stage that is causing
growing concern.
Officials admit that the conditions
are embarrassing, some high army
I officers are urging that: Pershing's
men be withdrawn as a military step
I and dless of con(litionS) but it i9

change in the administration policy
The American members of the Jint
commission which drew the Atlantic
City protocol, will maef bre Tuesday
to discuss Carranza's reqi:, t for modi
fication and cons'i-; -s.'Ver any
basis is offered tor'liirtheT conferences

Charles Douglas, an attorney for the
Carranza government, saw Counsellor
I Polk, of the state department, today

further plea for withdrawal of the

Army Urges Withdrawal.
Several army officers of high rank
are no longer attempting to cpneeal
their impatience over the joint com
mission's failure to secure ratification
of an agreement, and openly are urg
ing that the altered conditions in Mex
ico make it imperative to bring the
12,000 men now in Mexico to positions
on the border where they could be
handled to better advantage if it be
comes necessary.
VILLA IS MENACE. ' ,
Reports to the state and war de
partments today supported unoffi
cial reports indicating that Villa
is rapidly gaining strength in
northern Mexico that it makes his
suppression by the Carranza army
appear doubtful.
DIAZ GAINING..
At the same time followers of
Felix Diaz are said to be making
trouble in the south while Manuel
Palez and other rebel leaders are
gaining ground in the central por
tions of the republic.
Th ' official advices indicate that the
Carrf.nza forces in Saltilto two days
ago wre anticipating an attack by
, uiu iuiwo. ic fufciiiur UL in,;
state had declared that the govern
ment archives be prepared for removal
and many prominent civilians and of
ficials had sent their families to the
border. Successes of the Villa forces
ab'jut Torreon were confirmed by the
advices.
Villa Just Starting.
Villa's operations in the past few
weeks have convinced army men here
that he and other leaders of the reac
tionary movement are following a plan
of campaign having for its immediate
object the recruiting of an army and
the collection of equipment rather
than the occupation of territory. It is
pointed out that Villa has entered
towns of importance in northern Mex-
der them again without a struggle. Te
net result has been to add to his fight
ing strength materially through the
conversion of Carranza soldiers, cap
tured and deserting into rebel troops,
and through captures of arms and am-
munition, inpluding about 30 pieces of
artitlevy.
Unofficial reports : that the bandit
leader was- on his way to Chihuahua

it is known ' that General Murguia's
force there is not well supplied with
ammunition and many stories jf dis

ENTENTES REPLY
PARIS, Dec. 30.- In reply to the proffer of Germany and her allies for a peace confer
ence, the entente allies, in a collective note, declare that they "refuse to consider a proposal
which is empty and insincere." The note was handed to the American ambassador, Wm.
Graves Sharp, today by Premier Briand, and was made public simultaneously in London and
Paris.
The entente allied governments insist that no peace is possible so long as they have not
secured reparation for violated rights and liberties and the free existence of small states and
have not brought about a settlement for the future security of the world.
Is War Maneuver '
The note declares that the proposal of the. central powers is not an offer of peace, but a
"war maneuver." It is declared to be founded on "calculated misinterpretation of the char
acter of the struggle in the past, the present and the future."
