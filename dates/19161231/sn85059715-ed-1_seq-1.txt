Entente Governments Declare
They Can Not Consider
Germany's Proposal.
TEXT OF THE ALLIED REPLY
Many Incidents Are Alleged
Showing Germany Really is
Not Desirous of Peace.
< - ABSOCt.TKO ..Wfl
PARIS. Dec. 30.?In reply to the
proffer of Germany and her allies for
a peace conference, the Entente Allies,
in a collective note, declare that
they refuse to consider a proposal
which is empty and insincere. The
note was handed to the American
ambassador, William Graves Sharp,
today by Premier Briand, and was
made public simultaneously in London
and Paris. The Entente Allied
governments insist that no peace is
possible so long as they have not secured
reparation for violated rights
and liberties and the free existence
of small states and have not brought
about a settlement for the future security
of the world. The note declares
that the proposal of the Central
powers is not an offer of peace,
\ but a "war maneuver." It is declared
to be founded "on calculated
misinterpretation of the character of
struggle in the past, the present and
the future."
I Alms Not Outlined,
i The note does not specifically out^line
the definite war aims of the EnlOPtente
governments except Belgium.
Before the war, it'ls pointed out, Belgium
asked for nothing but to live in
harmony with her neighbors. Assailed
in spite of the treaties guaranteeing
her inviolability, Belgium, the note
says, "has taken up arms to defend
her independence and her neutrality
violated by Germany."
Belgium's; aim, which is declared to
be the only aim of its kind and government,
is indicated as "the re-establishing
of peace and.justice." They
only desire peace which would "assure
to their country legitimate reparation,
guarantees and safeguards
for the future."
' The note, which is the joint act of
Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy,
Japan, Montenegro, Portugal, Roumania,
Russia and Serbia, declares
that the .present strife was desired,
provoked and declared by Germany
and Austria-Hungary and that Germany
mode no effort to bring about
a pacific solution of the trouble between
Serbia and Austria-Hungaria
as did Great Britain, France and RusJteparation
Demanded.
A oeace concluded unon the Ger
man idea would be only to the advantage
ot the Central powers says
the note, while disasters caused by
the war demand penalties, reparation
and i guarantees.
" The German overtures are described
as a "calculated: attempt to influence
the future course of the war
and to end'it by Imposing a German
; peace. The overtures also are said
to have the effect of intimidating neutral
public opinion as well as to.stif/
fen opinion - in the Central powers,!
"worn out by economic pressure and
1 crushed by tho.supreme effort that has
( | been imposed upon their inhabitants."
"Finally," it is asserted, "these
overtures attempt to justify in ad:
vance-dn the rise of the world a new
series of crimes?submarine warfare;
deportations, forced labor and forced
f enlistment of the inhabitants against
their own country's interest and violation
of neutrality."
"The Allied governments of Belgium,
France. Great Britain; Italy;
Kg: Japan, Montenegro, Portugal, Rou f
mania, Russia and Serbia unite for
ff the defence of the liberty of their
peoples and faithful to agreements

whether to Issue a formal order to

who presided' at - the ' recent

' in. determining the commission's
position; At the .'hearing of -railroad

"This record," Commissioner McChord
told Vice President Atterbury
of the Pennsylvania, "Is full of the
sworn testimony of high officials of
railroads that they have not only violated
their agreements with each other,
written iandlverbal; but that, they
were deliberately engaged in the
pastime of- stealing cars from each
other, and keeping them."

"would not take such a statement as
that seriously,". Mr.,,McChord' replied
that "they are reputable people and
this record la full of It."

if you can; If knot then send them
empty."

The plan to Increase revenues,
which Secretary McAdoo is formu- I
lating 'with the president's approval,
probably will be submitted to leaders
in Congress within a few days after
the expiration of;the holiday recess.
Indications are that it will contain
recommendations that wool,' rubber ;
and coffee be taken from the free list
and placed under low tariffs, but it .
is more certain what recommendation
will be made with regard to sugar.
In fact, the entire tarifT program
of the plan, to increase revenues
has not. It is said, taken a
definite form.
Nominal Tariffs.
The tariffs under consideration are
understood to bo nominal and designed
to provide revenue only.
Rates that would- amount to a protective
tariff are understood to be op- :
posed by department officials and administration
leaders In Congress <

The tremendous volume of importations
of rubber and coffee woiild

and would distribute the burden
of taxation upon: virtually everyone
In the nation.,, Statistics showing,
