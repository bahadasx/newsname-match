COLLEGE SUFFRAGIS
T
President L. -W. St. Clair-
Moss Talks to Crowd in
Collector's Office.
COUNTY TIME IS UP
Delinquents in City Will
Have Monday as One
Day of Grace.
"Taxation without representation is
tyranny." "
Upon this war-worn but seldom disputed-text
Mrs. Luella W. St. Clair
Moss, one of Columbia's leading suff
ragists and president of Christian Col
lege, gave an extemporaneous talk
before a crowd of taxpayers, most of
whom were farmers and negro women,
when she paid her county taxes at the
courthouse yesterday morning.
Mrs. Moss, who recently gave a talk
on "What is Suffrage?" used none of
the newer arguments, such as the in
tellectuality of the modern women,
but treated her subject with regard to
the time and the place and the charac
ter of her audience. She said that
she had waited until the last day to
pay her tribute because she hoped
that the ballot would be granted to
her sex before tax-paying time came.
She said that her Revolutionary fore
fathers had fought against the tax
ation of the British because of no rep
resentation and that she was making
the same stand.
Then she asked a negro woman who
had just received her tax receipt
whether she didn't want to vote. But
the negro woman was laughing too
much to answer. Evidently she had
not given the question much thought.
After Mrs. Moss had delivered her
talk, J. R. Jordan, collector, told her
that he was sorry but he didn't have
the power to issue the franchise with
tax receipts.
Yesterdayxas the last day to pay
county taxes and tomorrow will be
the last day to pay city taxes; so the
offices of the county collector and of
Berry Jacobs, city colector were
crowded ail day.
Beginning Monday all back county
taxes will be Increased 5 per cent for
January and 1 per cent additional for
every succeeding month. Mr. Jacobs
will allow one day of grace, Monday,
for all delinquent city taxes. After
his office closes Monday night, delin
quent taxpayers will have a 1 per cent
increase levied on their taxes.
Late esterday afternoon Mr. Jac
obs estimated that this year's collec
tion would be $4,000 less than at the
same time last year, but should be
$2,000 more because of the increased
valuations. Although the county col
lections are larger, not so many re
ceipts have been issued. This is due
to the increase in levy by the road tax
and various school taxes levied by
many school districts.
NEW FACES AT THE COURTHOUSE
Count Officers to Change Tomorrow
Only a Few Holdovers.
Five new county officers will be
sworn in tomorrow. They are T. F.
Whitesides, who succeeds G. B. Sapp
as sheriff; G. E. Chambers, who suc
ceeds P. T. King as deputy sheriff;
James F. Stockton, who takes the place
of Benjamin Tate as judge of the
County Court from the northern dis
trict; W. M. Dinwiddle, who succeeds
himself as prosecuting attorney, and
E. T. Martin, who will be public ad
ministrator In place of S. F. Conley.
J. T. Rowland, who succeeds himself
as judge of the County Court from the
southern district, took the oath of
office Friday, and George E. Thomp
son, who will be county treasurer for
another term, was sworn in yesterday
afternoon.
W. H. Sapp, representative from
Boone County, who succeeds himself,
will be sworn in when the legislature
meets.
J. A. DODSON DIES OF FALL
Fracture at Base of Brain Thursday

J. Aubrey Dodson, who fell from a
scaffold at the home of Mrs. Maude
Higginbottom, 717 Missouri avenue,
Thursday afternoon, died at the Par
ker Memorial Hospital at 10 o'clock
last night without having regained
consciousness. He suffered a frac
ture at the base of the brain and sev
eral minor injuries.
Mr. Dodson lived at 104 North
Fourth street. He Is survived by a
wife and four children. Arrange
ments for the funeral have not been

TO YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR
The Daily Missourian, after an unu
sually prosperous year, takes this occasion to
wish all its friends and acquaintances twelve
months more of success and happiness. To
morrow will be New Year's Day, and no
paper will be issued. The next issue of the
Missourian- will be on the afternoon of Tues
day, January 2.
a-
back at him with the fact (it's in
figures below, and figures don't lie)
that the financial conditions are "vur
ry, vur-ry" favorable. The combined
dStfosits of the banks are $2,000,000,
only one bank having failed to gain
over 1915. Those who applaud the
wedded state will be pleased to know
that there was a record-breaking num
ber of marriage licenses issued, the
figures being 284. The largest pre
vious number issued in one year was
279.
Besides being made better the city
was made more beautiful. See the fig
ures for paving and sidewalks.
Births and Deaths Fall Off.
The year, according to the vital
statistics compiled by Dr. James Gor
don of Columbia, shows that there
were 239 births against 219 deaths.
The number of births and deaths is
somewhat lower than It was In 1915,
when there were 331 births to 223
deaths.
The police court the last year main
tained its average with other years.
According to M. L. Edwards, police
judge, the number of convictions av
eraged thirty a month, although some
months had as low asflfteen or twenty
convictions and other months as high
as forty or forty-five. .The total num
ber of convictions was 377, 12 of these
having trial by jury.
Drunkenness, which caused the con
viction of 113 persons, leads the list.
Disturbing of the peace comes next,
with ninety-nine. Gambling caused
the conviction of sixty, bootlegging,
thirteen; petit larceny, twenty-one;
general crimes, such as common as
sault and exceeding the speed limit,
fifty-one. Most of the arrests were
made among the negroes. The fines
run from $300 and costs for bootleg
ging to $1 and costs for "plain
drunks."
Banks Share In Prosperity.
That the prosperity of the commun
ity is echoed in the, business done by
her banking houses is the belief of
Columbia bankers. If this is true,
then the increase over last year of
$274,000 in deposits In local banks in
dicates an unusually prosperous year.
Last year saw a slump In banking
circles, but 1916 closed with local fi
nancial conditions again In Prosperi
ty Row. The published statements of
Columbia's six banks show that they
now boast of more than two million
dollars in deposits.
A comparison of the sworn bank
statements published in November,
1915, and the same month this year
show that the average increase in de
posits is $54,800. Only one bank fail
ed to gain during the year, while
another leads the list with an increase
of $89,000.
Record in Marriage Licenses.
The number of marriage licenses
issued this year has established a rec
ord for Boone County. The largest
previous number issued In one year

This year 284 have been issued and
John L. Henry, recorder of deeds, hop

Paving Better Than Appears.
The figures for paving done in Co
lumbia during 1916 appear small at
first glance. Here they are: Sexton
road, 11,739 square yards, cost $16,
054; West Broadway, 4J110 square
yards, cost $4,984; Hickman avenue,
3,871 square yards, cost $5,183; Total
19,781 square yards, cost $26,221.
It must be remembered, however.
that when paving was begun In Co
lumbia it was done on a large scale,
a great part of the city being paved
at once. The paving now is mostly
in extending and connecting streets.
Sidewalks have been laid the last
year as follows: Conley avenue from
Fifth to Sixth, cost $57; Ash street
from Garth to McBalne, cost $428;
total cost, $485.
Sewers have been put in in two dis
tricts: District 42, 1,634 lineal feet,
cost $1,015; district 28, 4,750 lineal
feet, cost $3,293; total, 6,834 lineal
feet, cost $4,308.
The year just past was a year of
contradictions and surprises as far
as the weather was concerned; in
some cases it was even a record break
er. iTo begin with, the temperature
on New Year's day was 62 degrees, the
highest recorded on that day since
1905 The year was ushered In with
rain and thunder added to the high
temperature. The twelve-Inch snow
of the last week in 1915 had disap
peared during the night.
Weather Was Contradictory.
The summer of 1916 was almost as
hot and dry as that of 1915 was cold
and wet. The latter was the coldest
on record, while there have been sev
en hotter summers than 1916. There
has been only one June colder than
June, 1916 that of 1903 and only
one July warmer that of 1901. Only
three Augusts on record have been
warmer, and there have been only
seven years when the total heat of the
summer months was greater. July
31 was the only July day on which the
temperature reached 100 degrees.
Both 1915 and 1916 were unfavor
able to farmers, the former being too
wet and the latter too dry. Scarcely
any rain fell after June 6, 1916. This
month was followed by the driest July
on record, and the warmest with one
exception. There were only 6.45 Inch
es of rainfall during the summer of
1916, while In 1915 there were 16.95
inches, 6 Inches more than normal. It
will be noticed that the excess of rain
fall in 1915, was as great as the total
In 1916.
Here Are School Figures.
The enrollment In Columbia High
School was 465 in 1916; 1,300 were in
the grade schools, and 440 in the Fred
Douglas School.
The enrollment of the University for
1916 was 4.354 and 4,069 for the year
1915. Six professors resigned, and
four new ones were added.
The hunUng licenses issued in 1916
number 956.
Gem Cafe Is Reopened.
The Gem Cafe was reopened yester
day by E. Baumgartner, who has em
ployed J. M. Mathis as manager. Dur
ing Farmers Week both of the rooms
will be open, but after that the main
room will be the only one used.

By United Press
PARIS, Dec 30. The Allies today
formally refused to enter peace nego
tiations with Germany without know
ing what conditions the Teutons had
to propose. The note replying to Ger
many charges that the German pro
posal appears more like a war meas
ure than a peace proposition.
The Allies expressed their resent
ment of the efforts of Germany to
place upon them the responsibility of
the war. The Allies in turn charged
the Central Powers with disturbing
European peace.
A note signed by all of the Allies
declared that these nations were as
strong for peace as in 1914, but added
that after the Invasion of Belgium
by the Central Powers and their en
gagement in war they could not end
the was at Germany's suggesUon.
Furthermore, the German proposal
is not an offer of peace, but appears
more like a war proposition, it was
asserted by representatives of the Al
lies here today. The grounds for these
assertions were that the proposals
came from the "imperial government
which claimed that treaties were
merely scraps of paper."
