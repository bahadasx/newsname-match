WITHOUT RESULTS
NOTHING ACCOMPLISHED
AT MEETING BETWEEN
LEADERS.
DECISION OK COURT
WILL HE AWAITED
Break Follows Demands Made
on Railroads by Brotherhood
Chief.
New York, Hoc. 80. Conferences
between representatives of the rail
roads and the. four brotherhoods of
railway employes, at which were din
cussed the possibilities of a settle
ment of the eight-hour controversy,
wore discontinue! abruptly when it
became apparent an agreement could
not be reached.
It was announced by both Bides
that there w.ould be no more meetings
until after the supreme court hands
down its decision on the constitution
ality of the Adamson act.
The break came, it was learned,
when the railroad representatives re
fused to concede the demands of the
brotherhood chiefs for an agreement
looking toward the enforcement of
the new wage schedule fixed by the
Adamson law, which goes into effect
Jan. 1.
The brotherhood chiefs held, it was
raid, that their men had the right to
begin drawing wages according to the
scale provided by the Adamson law
immediately after the law became ef
fective, irrespective of the suits
brought by the railroads to test its
"validity. "
A statement issued by Elisha Lee,
chairman of the conference commit-
' tee of railway managers, covered the
position assumed by the railroads on
this point. The statement sid:

t Washington the tailroads will keop
a record from Jan. 1 of the wages
of all employes affected by the Adam
- son law, in order that, if the law is
' upheld by the court the employes will
receive the extra back pay due them.
Tho rights of the employes in the in
terval will thus be amply protected.
"The statement has been made in
the press that the conference com
""mittee has been aiding in preparing
a bill f be supported by the railroads
and the employes alike, and to be of
fered as a substitute for the legisla
tion proposed by the administration
to hold strikes in abeyance until af
ter an investigation by a public body.
The national conference committee
has not been a party to such a pro
gram." The railroad managers said it
would be folly for them, in view of
the award made last week by a board
of arbitration in the case of the
switchmen's union, to pay the 50,000
switchmen who are members of the
brotherhoods at the rate of 10 hours'
pay for an 8-hour day, when the
x award grants only nine hours' pay for
tght hours' work.
Other than to say that they expect
to return to their homes in 24 hours,
the brotherhood leaders refused to be
quoted after the meeting.

Ind., and Miss Ada Hess, a teacher

T. A. McGahey the present president
of the concern wasn't able to trace
the different ownerships back to the
time of the concern's establishment,
but he was sure of the date that the
business was started.
There is quite a jump to the date
of the next business still surviving,
1863, but that date is far enough re
moved to have long antedated any of
the younger generation. S. B. Street,
the druggist, was established in that
year.
Taking up the insurance business
which his uncle started in 1807, Mr.
J. II. Brickell has for a number of

In 1867 the late S. Selig opened
a dry goods store in Columbus, and
after his death a number of years
ago, Messrs. A. Chapsky and Jno. A.
Lipsey took charge of the business.
The concern is now known as Lipsey
and Chapsky.
One of the largest dry goods estab

of years been owned by Messrs. Geo.
H. Ezell and Henry Beard. They car
ry in .stock everything worn by men
and boys.
In 1S87 a machine shop was opened
by Mr. P. M. Jacob, and since that
time his business has increased to
such an extent that he now has one
of the largest machine and foundry
works in the state.
One of the oldest jewelry concerns
in the south is that of C. C. Buder,
organized in 1877. Until the death
of Mr. E. E. Buder several years ago
the firm name was that of Buder
Brothers.
Robertson & Company, known as
the "Ole Reliable," has as large a
grocery trade as any store in the city.
This business was organized in 1885,
and has continued to grow each year.

goods store on Main street, was open
ed in 1889, and has for a number of
years been under the able manage
ment of Mr. John Steen, who for a
long time has been a member of the
city council.
Bush's Cafe, which opened for
trade near the M. and O. depot in
1912, is now doing a big business on
North Market street.
J. C. Hackleman & Son, wholesale
and retail grocers, who have been in
business since 1912, arc doing an
enormous business, a large amount
of which is through the planters of
this und surrounding counties.
The Smith Grocery Store, on North
Market street began business in
1913. This is a store that pleases its
customers.
Charley Lee's laundry, which has
been here since 1910, is well pat
ronized. The Broken Dollar Store, under
the capable management of Miss Ada
Glass, was opened in 1914.
Mike Kerby started in business in
1908 and does a large country trade

The proposed route traverses the
entire state of Mississippi, taking in
Corinth, Tupelo, Columbus, Enter
prise, Shubuta and other towns.
These towns are now practically con
nected by a modern system of good
roads which can be used to form in
tegral parts of the proposed highway,
so very little construction work will
be necessary.
Mr. McKinnon wants each town
which he visits to raise sufficient
money to- pay his expenses while
there and to contribute $25 to the
highway fund. Mr. S. B. Street, Jr.,
president of the Chamber of Com

who resides in Rockford, 111., request
ing more specific information; and

Hiitory of Bribery Charges.
J.h I -ion, Mi.is,, Dec. 30. Former
State Senator (5. A. Hobbs i. report
ed to have written a book in which
he gives a history of the bribery
iharges against himself and Gov.
Theodore (!. Bilbo. Gossip to this ef
fect has been current in Jackson for
six months, and there are those who
profess to know what they are talk
ins s.bout when they assert the state
ment is u fact. Mr. Hobbs is under
stood to have furnished the data, dic
tating to a stenographer, and it,s
said the "history" will be off tli
press in a short while.
It will be remembered that Senator
Hobbs was tri'.'d at Vieksburg three
years airo on an indictment charging
him with soliciting and receiving a
bribe from Sieve Castleman, of Bel
zoni, in return for his vote in favor
of a new county of which Belzoni
was to btt the capital. He was acquit
ted after one of the most sensational
trials ever experienced in Mississippi.
A year later Gov. Bilbo, then lieu
tenant governor, was tried at Jack
son on the same cha:re, having ob
tained a chrfige of -"ver.ne 'to this
county. He was also acquitted.
When C-ov. Bilbo came into his
kingdom as chief ' executive of the
state, it was supposed that, as a mat
ter of source, he would "take care"
of Senator Hobbs by giving him one
of the very best offices at his dispo
sal but he did not, and right there
is where the governor and his old
friend Hobbs came to tho parting of
the ways. "Hobbs stayed around the
capitol during the session of the leg
islature, and for some time thereaf
ter, but never got a "crumb" from
the "pio counter." He finally went
on a tour through the west until he
came to the conclusion the best pana
cea vas to take the public into his
confluence.
There is much speculation here as
to what Mr. Hobbu may know as
well us to what he will tell, but it
is infii .u-d by those who are on the
"inside" as to the compilation of the
"history" that it has not been writ
ten in a vein that ia friendly to the
governor.
Tha Columbui Auto Co.
In making a history of the growth
and development of the business in
dustries of Columbus it would be im
possible to make a full record unless
a considerable share was taken up
with the automobile industry, as Co
lumbui runks first in well equipped
garages and sales rooms for almost
every standard make of car.
And when one mentions automo
biles and Columbus together the
name of the Columbus Auto Co. in
voluntarily comes to mind.
This well equipped garage, under
the active and njrgreive manage
ment of its progressive president and
mannger, Mr. Sam Kaye, Jr., is cer
tainly in the forefront of model gar
ages in the state.
Here is the sales agency for the
Ford and they carry in stock an
enormous supply of every part of one
of these the car universal.
Their mechanical department has
built up an enviable reputation for
work done right.
The concern is a continuation and
growth of the Kaye Garage, estab
lished by Mr. Sam Kaye, Sr. Under
the direction of the present affable
young gentleman at its head the
busim .'is is continuing to make grati
fying strides ahead.

Christmas Savings Clubs.
There have been few finer things
ever thought of than the Christmus
Savings Clubs,
Notwithstanding the fact thut the
idea is relatively new this easy plan
has taught more people the saving
habit within the last few years than
almost all other plans combined.
The thought was a happy one. For
who doesn't like to have the assur
ance that they will have a certain
amount for their Christmas shopping.
The plan from its first inception
has appealed alike to rich and poor,
and because of its simplicity and the
strength of its appeal it has taught
rich men's sons and daughters the
value of not spending all they have
and less fortunate men and women
and boys and girls have learned the
ease with which a competence could
be secured and have become persis
tent Silvers largely to their benefit.
For not near all of the money that
is saved from Christmas to Christ
inas in these clubs is spent in the holi
day season. Not by any means.
Much of the total of these "Savings
come from people who have never
saved before. And with a nest egg
accumulated they start' out with the
idea of saving in dead earnest.
If you are a parent and have a
child who has not such an account,
take our advice and open one NOW.
And if you are not a saver your
self, you should have one for your
self by all means.
The knowledge just before next
Christmas that- you have $51), $75,
$100 or $110 waiting for you in the
bank is one of the finest feelings!
you could imagine and the tip is
given by one who has experienced
that feeling..
Both the National Bank of Com
merce and the First State Bank op
erate Savings Clubs.
You may begin with' 2c, fc or any
amount you choose and next Christ
mas your entire yearly savings plus
four per cent interest will be mailed
you in. time for the holidays.
The courteous gentlemen at either
of the1 banks will be only too glad
bi expbiin any part of the plan you
i di.n't understand.
Make up your mind NOW to enter
one or both of these clubs.
