is the pin pose of this article to an
swer the question as nearly as it Is
possible to do so.
Widely conflicting statements have
been given out regarding tlovernor de
Baca's health It has been said that
lie is In the final stages of an incura
ble malady and is so nearly a dying
man that the governorship will from
the beginning have to be administered
by others. This is not true.
It has also been said that Mr. de
Baog, suffering merely from the se
ven, physical strain of a healed po
litical campaign, has fully recuperated
and Is now in as good condition as
i mild he expected of one of his age
This also is not true.
Those who expected to see the next
governor carried from the Santa Ke

were disa ppnintcd Those who ex
pected to see him spring from the
platform of his sleeper with the eles
tlc and buoyant steps of a man in the

physicians call it. pernicious anemia,

Mllholland Boissevain, whose recent
death on the Pacific coast attracted
countrywide attention. The people of
New Mexico know little of Mrs. I'.ols-
sevain'i Illness except from what they
have read iii the press; but from per
sonal observation they know a good
deal about the late Judge W illiam II.
I'ope, whose death s few months ago,
like, that of Mrs. Bolascvaln, was due
to the same malady that (lovernor de
Haca Is said to be suffering from.
Consequently it is more enlightening
to compare Governor de Baca lo
Judge Pope than to Mrs lioissevain.
Governor de Haca la to all appear
ances much stronger, fresher ami
more alert today than Judge Pop" was
six months prior to Ins death. There
is on his (gee nothing Of the drawn,
set expression of constant pain, that
was so distressing symptom with
Judge Pope, ills i dor is much clear
er, his eye much brighter. The only
point of comparison between them Is
a Feebleness of step, but ..t that, Gov
ernor lie Ultra's step is not so feeble
as was that of Judge Pope at a time
when the latter was hearing and de
ciding Important cases in the United
States district court.
Another comparison easily under
stood by the people of New Mexico
may throw some light on the new gov
ernor's condition. Thousands of citi
zens saw and cheered Mr de liaea
when he appeared on the floor of the
I democratic convention that nominated
him in Santa Kc last August. Still
'more thousands saw and heard him
jwhen he addressed a monster demo
cratic rally in the national guard ar
mory In Albuquerque on the Saturday
I night before the election at which he
j was chosen governor. Governor do
Baca looks today to be in better
health than on either of those occa
sions. The improvement is seen in
I his complexion. In the brightness of
'his eye md In the warmth and spolt
jtaneity of his greeting of those whom
'he meets.
Too much Importance should not be
attached to the fact that the new gov
ernor was accompanied from Los An

and that he went from the train

Before making any reply Ihe si
llied powers desire particularly to pro.
t against the, two essential asser

that pretend to throw upon the allies
responsibility for the war, ami pro
claim the victory Of the central

'The allied governments cannot ad
mit an affirmation dotlbly Inexact and
I winch suffers to render sterile all ten
tative negotiation. The allied nations
line pustulned for thirty months a

have shown by their acts their attach

strong today as it was an HM4. Hut
