"GIRL HOBO" 15
IN BAD
FOR WRONG
According to the Los Angeles pa
pers received here esterday, Billie
Peterson, known as the "girl hobo,"
who was arreted and brought to
Tombstone several months ago for
kidnapping, has again gotten Into
trouble In Los Angeles. This time
St Is for playing decoy for a bandit
lover, and Is heM for being an ac
complice, for having aided in the rob
bery of a grocer store. Both the
Los Angeles Examiner and Times had
the girl's picture on the front page,
giving a long story of the escapade of
the Peterson girl and Louis E. Sharff,
the hold-up man. It 'will be remem
bered that the girl plead guilty In the
local superior court to kidnapping a
BIsbee girl and bringing her to El
Paso, and after a severe reprimand by
Judge Lockwood promised to go to
her parents in California and amend
tinr ftnvi with a ten tpnr RiinnpndpH '
sentence hanging over her head She
left the state Immediately and the
next thing heard of er was the pres
ent trouble. Not having been com
mitted In this state, however, he
cannot be brought back according to
local officials, and no doubt she will
be severely dealt witn In Los Angeles,
when bei record is disclosed.
HICH PRICE OF COPPER
BLAMED FOR GOAL
SHORTAGE
PHOENIX. Dec. 30 The high price
of copper Is responsible for the scarc
ity of coal In Arizona, according to
W. S. Goldworthy, local general
agent of the Santa Fe Railroad. While
the copper mines are enjoying their
present prosperity and paying bonus
es for good miners, he explained, the
coal mine operators are having trou
ble In getting miners.
The Santa Fe, he said, has plenty
of cars on band at Gallup, X. M.. the
chief source of coal supply for Ari
zona, but there are no men at the
mines to fill them. It Is proposed
to urge Idle miners to go up to Gallup
In order to take care of the present
shortage.

It as rumored jesterday that Mr.
Campbell would take his oath as gov.

There was a whirl of rumor. In fact,

good many questions. If Campbell

jlace? Can Campbell take oath of
office as governor, before his former
-ath as tax commissioner has been
vacated by resignation?

ARIZONA CATTLEMEN TO
FIGHT RAISE IN THE
GRAZING RATES
PHOENIX. Dec. 30 With millions
at stake In Arizona and the southwest
sheep and cattlemen through a com
mittee in session at the Adams hotel
this afternoon, bexan to prepare a
brief stating their ase against the
raising of the price or grazing In the
national forest reserves.
Startling In the extreme, say the
sheep-cattle men. Is the advices from
WnhiBtoa that grazing rates will be
Increased at least 100 per cent. This
advance, they say, will work an over
whelming hardship upon them and
that In conseqnence everything possi
ble will be done, morally and finan
cially, to cause the government to
reconsider, and If possible permit the
grazing rates to remain where they
are at present.

William Johnson was found In a tent,
within two miles of the Stewart place
In Williamson valley, by Clarence
Stewart, Death was probably due to
rheumatism of the heart. An exam-
inatlon of the body showed no marks
of violence, and the finding on the
premises of a sack of placer gold dust
valued at over $500 was convincing
evidence that death came from natur
al causes.

VOOD NOT HIGHER
IN TOMBSTONE
According to Proprietor E. H.
Reeves of the Reeves Wood and Coal
Yard, the price of wood has not ad
vanced In Tombstone, as stated In
'ast night's Prospector, but the price
remained the same as heretofore. Mr.
Reeves also stated that he received
a bill of lading of a car of coal from
New Mexico, which he expects to re
ceive the middle ot aext week. At
yet Tombstone has not suffered from
the shortage of coal or wood, and the
receipt of a car next week will fill
the demand until more can be secur
ed, which will be pleasing news to
Tombstonltes who bad feared that the
same fate which befell BIsbee and
j Douglas would be our lot. T-oprle-
tor J. H. McPhcrson of the McPher-
, son Coal Yard also has a car which
he expects any day now and Tomb

to fear Jn the way ot further short-ace.

G. Q. SMELTER SHUTS
000RS TO CUS
TOM ORE
DOUGLAS, Dec. 30 Notices have
been sent by the Copper Queen smel
ter to all customs shippers that the
company will refuse to accept ore
from any except those who have con
tracts. The new ruling goes Into ef
fect Monday.
The ruling further specifies that
customs shippers who hold contracts
will be held rigidly to the amount
specified in the contract and will be
allowed no exfra tonnage.
This ruling will have the effect of
shutting off a quantity of ore from
outside sources. It is understood
that the company Intends to replace
this with ore from Its own mines in
order to get the full benefit of the
market.
Inquiry at the Calumet tc Arizona
smelter yesterday developed the fact
that that company has not been ac
cepting any new contracts for some
time. It will contlbue to handle the
contracts It has at this time. Includ
ing the ore of the New Cornelia. Shat-tuck-Aiizona,
the Eighty-five mine and
a few other shippers in the southwest.
The persons who win be affected
chiefly by the new ruling will be the
newer properties. Most of those
shipping under contract hare been
crowding In much more ore than their
contracts, made In times when copper
was lower, called for.
