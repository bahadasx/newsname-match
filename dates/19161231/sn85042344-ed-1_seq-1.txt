Let Us Save the Old High
School Site
The World Is heartily in favor of
thu proposal emanating from tho
women eif Tulsa tn secure all of the
old high school block for a city hall
and park site eninliined. This has
been one of the hubbies nf The World.
If action is not taken now before a
sky-scraper building is erected on the
lot recently purchased by tho Cosilen
interests for an office building it will
never be secured and this priceless
heritage to nil the peof, (? T.iI.sa
will forever pass out of their hands
and In future years when the cllv
comes to a realization of Ihe value
and importance of a public breathing
spot closo to the business center It
will cost millions of dollars and no
surh location will be available at any
nrice. The objection has been raised
that the whool board will need tho
old high school bulldinir fur school
purposdM for another three or four
ycurs. Thut argument is a spurious
objection and deserves no considera
tion. It wilt lake two or three years
to beautify this block after tho old
building is eieared away and the peo
ple of Tulsa uro entitled to the bene
fits of the central park now and it
can bo secured none too soon with
ull the haste possible, Tho people!
of this city will gladly vole enough
more money to build additional school
buildings to meet present us well as
future needs as fast us they arc pre
sented to them for approval. 13c
sldes when tho bond Issue for the now
high school was asked for It was
claimed that the old buibPtiK fn ad
dition to beinK Inadequate for high
school purposes was unsafe and dan
gerous and It certainly has not Im
proved in security with the passing
years. It is an eyesore and should
be razed us soon as the present term
of school Is ended. This is tho most
important proposition tlie people of
Tulsa have ever hud to consider and
It must he acted upon now or never.
Houlevurds and parks, In addition to
