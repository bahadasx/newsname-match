REPLY OF THE ENTENTE ALLIES TO THE PEACE PRO
POSAL Or THE CENTRAL POWERS GIVEN OUT FOR
PUBLICATION IN PARIS
Allies Declare They Refiue to
and Ineffective Proposition tor a tonieren,
Ententes Declare is "Not a Peace Note, but Rather a War
Maneuver" Berlin Newspaper is Quoted As Saying that
Hope of Speedy Peace is Becoming More Remota and
That "This Feelin in the Leading Circle ir Belligerent
Capitals Is Too Plain" Reports From Berlin Hint At a
Second Note Sent Out By President Wilson, Explanatory
of the First Note to the Central Powers and the Entente
Allies, But This is Denied By Washington Officials Who
Say Rumor is Probably Due to the Two Statements Issued
by Lansing, the Day After the Dispatch of the Original
Note Was Announced.
Paris, Dec. 30. The entente
governments replying today to
the German peace proposals,
declare they refuse to consider
Germany's insincere and inef
fective proposition for a confer
ence, which the entente note
says "is not a peace note but
rather a war maneuver."
The entente governments re
plying to Germany's peace pro
posals say that the allied gov
ernments of Belgium, France,
England, Italy, Japan. Monte
negro, Portugal, Rumania, Rus
sia and Serbia are "United for
the defense of the liberty ot
their people and faithful to the
nts taken not to lay
down their arms separately,!
have resolved to reply collect
ively to the pretended propo
sition of peace" which was ad
dressed to them through the
United States, Spain, Holland
and Switzerland by the Cen
tral Powers.
Before making any reply,
the Ententes desire particular
ly to protest against "two es
sential assertions" in the ene
my's note that "pretends to
have thrown upon the Entente
the responsibility for the war
atid proclaims the victory of the
f'onl nil Bowers."
The reply says "the Entente I
cannot admit an affirmation I
as exact which renders sterile
the Entente have sustained
all tentative negotiations, says
for thirtv months a war. which
they diil everything to avoid.",
"But it is not upon the word
of Germany, after a violation
of its engagements that peace

ments of terms that negotia
tions should be opened is not
an offer of peace."
The reply says the putting
forward by Germany of a
"sham proposal" lacking all
substance and precision ap
pears to be less an offer of
ace than a war maneuver.
"It. is founded on calculated
m!oi(ntAunnl n i Ur nf Yl H VIM' t r

of the struggle in the past, pres-
ent and future.
"As for the past," the note
says "the German note takes
no account of facts, figures

the war was desired, provoked ;

Austria-Hungary. !
At the Hague conference it

fused all proposals for disarma-
mpnt. In Julv. 10 1 I. it was
Austria-Hungary, who af.i-i-having
addressed to Serbia an
unprecedented ultimatum, de
clared war upon her in spite
of the satisfaction which had
been accorded her. Th ci n
tral powers then rejected
nttpmnt m.ldi lv the cntiTile
to bring about a pacific S-ollI-
tion of .1 purelv local conflict.

The reply says peace con
cluded on these terms would
be only an advance, to the ag
gressors "who after imagining
they would reach their goal in
two months, discovered after
two years that they could nev
er attain it." -
"As for the future, the dis
asters caused by the German
declaration of war and the in
numerable outrages commit
ted by Germany and her alies
against both belligerants and
neutrals demand penalties, re
paration and guarantees."
