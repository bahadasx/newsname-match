BRITISH WITHSTAND
POWERFUUTTACKS
Germans Endeavor in Vain
to Retake Positions, Says
General Haig.
SLAVS STILL GAINING
Russian Successes Reported
Against Both Austrians
and the Turks.
IJy ED L. KEENE
(United Press Staff Correspondent!
LOXDOX, Ju'l 29. The British
front is withstanding Germany's most
powerful attacks. Artillery hammer
ing and massed attacks with hand-to-hand
lighting hae so far failed to
dent the lines advanced by the recent
British offensive, General Haig indi
cated in his report today.
It is the belief of military experts
here that the Kaiser is now utiliz
ing the great reserves concentrated
west of the British lines from Verdun
and other points on the west battle
front in a bitter endeavor to wrest
back from the Britains the land they
have captured in the last few days.
Despite this. Haig reported continued
progress today.
His narrative indicated particularly
violent engagements near Pozieres.
the newly captured point from which
the Britibh are endeavoring to push
on toward Baupaume. There the cam
paign was marked by unceasing hand-to-hand
fighting.
Just north of Longueval, at Delville
wood. British positions are under in
tense pressure from the German lines.
General Haig reported that two or
three German regiments presumably
Brandenburgers were annihiliated at
Delville woods.
The Russians have made further gi
gantic strides both in the eastern bat
tle zone and in the Caucasus, accord
ing to Pctrograd. From Parnobol,
Russian forces under General Leczi
ki, chief-of-staff to General Ginilski,
with the fourth Russian army corps,
have overwhelmed the Austrian lines
and forced them back to south of the
Dneister towards Stanislau.
Presumably the Russians advanced
along the railroad which winds from
Parnobol down and back up to Lem
burg. The army of the Grand Duke
Xicholas, which has already achiecd
some record for speedy advance, is
htill hurrying along, according to Pc
trograd, and has captured Czerzany,
thrown back the Turks' opposing
pressure toward Krarput and beaten
back a Turkish attack from Mossul.
Berlin frankly admitted the retire
ment of the Teutonic lines south of
Kovel, after the Russians had suc
ceeded in penetrating their advanced
position. The German war office dis
missed the lighting on the western
front with the declaration that strong
British attacks in the region of Poz
ieres had failed.
The Austrian statement, twenty
four hours delayed, from Vienna ad
mitted Russian advances toward
Brody which the Russians announced
they captured yesterday and Russian
encroachments along the remainder of
their line.
The French statement indicated that
the Germans have resumed their vio
lent bombardment of Verdun and claim
further gains on the right bank of the
Mense for the French attackers.

Campaign Nears End.
Another large crowd heard the
Boone County Democratic candidates
at the barbecue and picnic just out-
ide of Huntsdale yesterday after
noon. The crown was so large mai
soon cleaned up everv thing to eat
in sight. On a small platform in the
shade of a cluster of trees the candi
dates, beginning with aspirants for
coroner and ending with those wishing
to be representative in the Legislature,
spoke for three hours and a half.
George Thomson, candidate for county
treasurer with no opposition on the
Democratic ticket, presided. Most of
the candidates were able to boast of
long residence in Boone County, hav
ing been once a resident of Missouri
Township, or having many relatives
there now or at some time in the
past.
A soft-drink stand and a doll rack
with "three balls for five" were liber
ally patronized.
The wind-up of the campaign for
the candidates will be at Shaw tomor

STAGE IS BEING SET
FOR FOUR-DAY FAIR
Concession Stands Going Up,
and Harness Horses Take
Practice Heats.
STABLES SOON FULL
$!,(00 Mule-Colt Show Will
Be Biggest of Its Kind
in Country.
With a scattering of concession
stands, the stables nearly full of
horses and a few speeding around the
traik, the fairgrounds began to show
real preparedness jesterday for the
Boone County Fair that is to be here
this week, from Tuesday, August 1,
until Thursday, August 4. Practical
ly all the horses showed at the Mo
berly and Xcw Bloomfield fairs were
brought here direct by R. L. Hill,
secretary of the association. A special
train of twentj cars of horses arrived
at noon yesterday over the Wabash.
Fourteen saddle and harness horses
of Miss Loula Long of Kansas City
were among the first to arrive; they
came direct from the Longview Farm
at Lees Summit. However, Miss
Long will not be here, since she sel
dom rides in saddle exhibitions, but
prefers driving in the heavy harness
class.
Blades & Holmau came here from
the Xcw Bloomfield fair with eight
head of horses. Joe Harris, James
Buford and Ed Moore also came di
rect from the Xcw Bloomfield Fair to
exhibit here. Roy L. Davis of Kansas
City, with six or seven horses, will
probably come to Columbia and enter
the fair; Mr. Hill succeeded in in
ducing him to come while at Xcw
Bloomfield.
The $1,000 Mule-Colt Show to be
held in connection with the fair is by
far the biggest show of its kind in
the United States. The idea belongs
strictly to Columbia, and the unus
ual amount of the premiums was rais
ed by the merchants to out-do com
pletely any former effort in this line.
The mules winning the first three
prizes are to become the property of
the Retail Merchants' Association; the
others are to be kept by their owners.
who receive rewards in gold.
The race track was deep with dust
and in the worst condition all day
yesterday, but last night it was thor
oughly sprinkled down and it was
rolled this morning, so that now it
is in excellent shape. The first real
practice heats for the coming races
will be made today and continued to
morrow, so the horses will be in fit
condition for the contests beginning
Tuesday.
The season tickets were put on sale
Friday night at the Columbia Drug
Company, the Drug Shop and the Peck
Drug Company. A heavy sale is ex
pected, for the officials of the fair an
ticipate a larger crowd in daily at
tendance than was at cither the Mo
berly or Xew Bloomfield fairs.
All the available space near the
grandstand has been taken by the
concession stands, and many of them
are open, ready for business.
(JETS PROMOTION AND A BRIDE
E. II. Rucker, 31. U. Teacher, Will
Wed 3IIss Harriett 31. Evans.
When Everett H. Rucker, assistant
in the poultry husbandry department
of the College of Agriculture, accepted
a position as instructor in the same
department of the Massachusetts Ag
ricultural College at Amherst, Mass.,
he won more than merely a promo
tion; to his new work in September
he will take as his bride Miss Har
riett M. Evans, last year a student in
the College of Arts and Science of the
University.
The following, from the Ottumwa

ment of their second daughter, Har
riett Mary, to Everett Henry Rucker
of Columbia, Mo. The wedding will
take place Monday, August 28, at the

M.U, MAY SOON HAVE
REAL AMPHITHEATER
Prof. H. F. Major Would j
Utilize the Hollow Just
North of Switzler Hall.
SPOT FOR EXERCISES
Work to Begin Next Week
Hopes to Finish When
Money Comes.
When Prof. H. F. Major, landscape
gardener of the University, begins
work this week on the hollow north
of Switzler Hall, he will be laying
the foundation for what some day
may be a Grecian amphitheater on the
West Campus, where all except winter
University exercises will be held. It
i may also be a place for entertainments
and amateur theatricals'.
I Professor Major will this week cut
down three soft maples in the hollow.
I Later he hopes to be able to regrnde
the banks and change the direction of
the ditch that now drains the space.
This ditch has always been the divid
ing line between the audience and the
players when the University women
have used the place for their May Day
plays and their Stunt Week theatri
cals. Aside from these infrequent
uses, the possibilities of the spot have
been oerIookcd.
Very little money would be neces
sary for the proper development of
the idea, thinks Professor Major. "The
hollow is naturally adapted for just
such purposes," he said yesterday.
"It is not beyond hope that some day
the place may be made fit for practi
cally all the exercises of the Univer
sity, including the Commencement
Day programs."

Tournament Nearly Over.
.Miss Helen Hungate became the
summer champion of the women's sin
gles in tennis when she defeated Miss
Helen Moffett Friday afternoon in two
sets by the score of 6-0, 1-6, 6-2. The
playing of both was characterized by
steady, consistent and well placed re
turns, with strong service and few
double faults.
The championship for the mixed
doubles was decided yesterday after
noon when Biggs and Biggs defeated
Simpson and Arnold in the fifth set
of the finals by the lopsided score of
C-l. Biggs and Biggs took the first
set of the match Friday evening, after
the games had twice gone to deuce,
by the score of 8-6; then they also
took the second set by the easy score
6-1. Simpson and Arnold rallied and
took the next two sets 6-3 and 6-4;
this tied the match, and the deciding
set was scheduled for yesterday after
noon. The finals in the men's singles
are now scheduled for Monday after
noon, when Ellard and Sisson meet
to decide the championship. Ellard
suffered a strained back when he
played Taylor in the semifinals, but is
now in condition to meet his op
ponent; he was practicing in nice
form yesterday afternoon. Sisson has
been practicing regularly this week
since he defeated Gordon in the semi
finals Monday.
The finals in the men's doubles will
be played off early this week when
Xcwport and Marr meet Ritter and
Crookshank. Gwinn, Ritter's former
