?? On. I
The possible resignmiun ui .
Inmbia from the Intercollegiate Eow-I
lng Assoslation, if it is followed by
Pennsylvania, as has been intimated
in certain rowing circles, will probably
spell the death of the four-mile
regatta on the Poughkeepsle course.
Within the last two or three years
there has been a growing sentiment
in favor of shortening the 'varsity
race distance. Titular contests at
either two or throe miles have been
__ ? m.witiifa nnd It is
suggesteu UH tt DUuov.k??w
known that several colleges, which
now encourage rowing but do not en
ter either the Poughkeepsle or New
I London regatta, would not be adI
verse to competing in a two mile
race. It is not beyond the bounds of
possibility that from the ashes of
I the Poughkeepsle regatta, if it is
I abandoned, may arlBe an American
College Henley at which will comI
pete not four or five colleges but
twice or three times that number,
Wo once the regatta is established and
Kgfj, ? (ultabie course selected.

game until the eighth Inning, when
