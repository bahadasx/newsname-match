Assurances of English Am
bassador Considered Pre
linnary Reply to Protest
Entered by United States
Washington. July 29. The Brit
ish embassy today officially an
nounced that assurances given the
state department by Ambassador
Sorlni-Hlce regarding the scope of
the blacklist SKslnst certain Ameri
can firms might be considered a pre
llmlnary reply to this government's
note cabled to London Thursday
night. " '
The text of the assurances given
the state department follows:
''There Is no Idea of blacklisting a
neutral firm merely because It con
tinues to do business with a firm that
Is blacklisted, but If a neutral firm
habitually and systematically acted
aa a cover for a blacklisted firm and
so caused Indirect trading between
British firms and blacklisted firms,
the esse would be different. ' i
"Regarding payment to blacklisted
firms, our action does not affect pay
ment to a neutral and we habitually
grant licenses to British' firms to pay
current debts to blacklisted firms, un:
less It Is clear beyond a doubt' that
such payment would be passed on to
create a credit for enemies In enemy
territory." ' .
The embassy has definite knowl
edge that large sums of money or. the
equivalent In credit has been obtain
ed for the German government by
blacklisted firms, It was aald today.
No statement as to the alleged
amount was obtainable, aa It was said
such action would result In the dis
closure of the secrets of neutrals and
'Arms not under sueplclon.

have always been a great fellow to
rely on my luck. It has pulled me
through before and maybe It will

Three more arrests as a- result of
the Investigation of the bomb outrage
are expected before Monday. Admis
sion was made today by one police
official that the supposed ringleader
has not yrt been taken Into custody,
although a minute description of him
is In the handa of the police. It Is
declared, however, that hla Identity
may become known some time today.
While Warren 'Billings, held as the
most Important suspect thus far
taken, has been entangled In a mate
of circumstantial evidence, there Is
a theory that he may have been mere
ly a tool of "higher ops."

An evidence of : the , precipitate

town waa announced.
Petrogrsd eagerly awaited full

city's conquerors, since Brody had
been Austrian field base, and an

CREW OF SUB-SEA
. Baltimore, July 29. Fear of spies
bad grown to an obsession with cer
tain members of ttie German sub
marine Deutschland today. With two
additional British tramp vessels in
the harbor for cargo and the British
er Ardgryfe mailing no move to load,
the Deutschland watchers developed
an unusual nervousness.
Even trivial things worried them.
An expedition from the Tlmmons
made a hurried trip to the long pri
vate pier to which press tugs are
tied, ' after discovering that a pri
vate telephone line had toeen installed
there : jTha press men eaw to It that
no step was made to remove the
wires, for they knew that German in
fluence had been operating along
the water front for several days to
clear away newspaper men and pre
vent them o'btainlng hoats.
The time for the Deutschland to
depart still is an unsolved apparent
ly unsolvable mystery. All the talk
is that she la going out within a few
days, but the truth Is not in the
rumor mongers that swarm the water
front. .
Indications with the Deutschland
promoters are that they are not un
duly alarmed about the fate of the
Deutschland's sister ship, the Bre
men, though they will be It she does
not appear In the next few days.

GERMAN ATTACKS IN
UELVILLE WOOD REPl'LSED
London. July 29. Two desperate
German counter-attacks against posi

London, July 29. The British
front Is withstanding Germany's most
powerful attacks.' Artillery hammer
ing and massed attack with hand-to
hand fighting have so tar tailed to
dent the lines advanced by the recent
British offenstve, General Halg In
dicated In hie report today.
: It Is the belief of military experts
here that the kaiser is now utilising
the great reserves concentrated In
front of the British line from Verdun
and other points on the eastern hattle
front In a bitter endeavor to wrest
back from the British the land they
have captured In the last tew days.
Despite this, Halg reported continued
progress today.
Halg's narrative Indicated a par
ticularly heavy engagement 'beyond
Posieres, from which newly captured
point the British are trying to push
on toward Bapaume. There the com
bat was marked by unceasing hand-to-hand
fighting. Just north of
Longueval. at Delvllle wood, British
positions are under Intense pressure
from the German lines. , How san
guinary this fighting along the line
from Thlepval to Longueval has been
waa confirmed In iHalg's opinion that
two or three German regiments pre
sumably ths Brandenburgers were
annihilated In Delvllle woods. ;
The 'Russians have made further
gigantic strldea, both In the eastern
battle tone and In the Caucasus, ac
cording to 'Petrograd. From Tamo
pol Russian forces under General
Leoalckt. chief of staff to General
GIHnskl, of the Fourth Russian army
corps, have overwhelmed the Aus
trian lines and forced them back to
Some of the parties who have in
vestigated the wreck of the big pulley
and belt that operated the pumps for
the Frultdale ditch at the Golden
Drift dam advance the opinion that
the pulley may have been hunted In
starting it np at an excessive speed.
If this should prove true. It would
disprove the dynamite theory that
has been generally given as respon
sible tor the accident Mr. Davis
contends that the machinery had not
yet gained speed, the explosion oc
curring when the six-foot pulley had
made only two or three revolutions.
Machinists have made a thorough
examination of the damage, and be
lieve that It might be possible to have
the pump repaired la time to again
put water into the Frultdale ditch be
fore the end of the week. There is
an old pulley that was formerly
used now available, and while not as
satisfactory as the one that was
wrecked, would probably fill the bill
A belt is available at Portland, and
If the finances can be arranged by
the water users it is likely that the
belt will be ordered down today. The
engineers say it Is possible that by
getting this belt the pump could be
put in commission again by Thurs
day. "
Governor Withycomb wired Dis
trict Attorney Miller Saturday morn
ing to the effect that there were no
fnnda available for the offering of a
reward for the apprehension of par
ties who may have been responsible
for the wrecking - of the pumps.

The Germans, he said, suffered
heavy losses in the attacks, which
occurred during the bight.

said. "We are making progress de-

Nicholas, which already has achieved
some records for speedy advance, Is

Petrograd, and has . captured Er
sanany, thrown back the Turks op

back a Turkish attack from Mossul.
Berlin frankly admitted retirement
of the Teutonic lines south of Kovel,
after the Russians had succeeded In
penetrating their advanced positions.
The German war office dismissed the
fighting on .the western front with
the declaration that strong British
attacks In the region of Posteres had
failed.
The Austrian statement, 24 hours
delayed from Vienna, admitted Rus
sian advance, toward Brody. which
the Slavs announced they captured
yesterday. .. '
The French statement Indicated
that the Germans have resumed their
violent bombardment of Verdun and
claimed further gains on the right
