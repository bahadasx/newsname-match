KEV. F. A. COLLYMORE,
SHERIFF WHEELER AN
MURES PLATFORM
TO
Tombstone, Arizona,
July 28, 1916.
TO THE PUBLIC:
Courtes of the Tombstone Epitaph
In announcing myself a candidate
for re-election to the office of sheriff,
I believe the people have the right to
demand of me a complete understand
ing of m Ideas, intentions. In other
words, a thorough knowledge of Hif
personal platform In which 1 believe
and which I Intend to maintain and
uphold if re-elected.
1st. Because since the advent of
prohibition all usual crime has dim
inished murder and all serious crime
almost b) one-half and because the
banks have more depositors, the mer
chants fewer unpaid bills, the mines
fewer accidents because of these
facts I believe In a better and more
comprehensive prohibition law. A
law free of technicalities, one which
can really be enforced by our own lo
cal officers.
2nd I believe the old "Duff)"
gambling law should be restored The
"Duffy" law actually prohibited gambl
ing IN ALL FORMS. It was repealed
.hrough the influence of those who
favor gambling, and the present law
iren us instead The present law
Is not even called a gambling law,
but Is referred to In the Statutes as a
"Gaming" law In other words on!)
:ertain games are prohibited not all
games.-
3rd I bellve in enforcement of all
law and that law may be really en
forced, I believe the people should de
mand, of the coming legislature, laws
which really mean those things the
people wish and actually desire and
intend. Laws free from all legal
.atches, quibbles and technicalities
vhich destroy and defeat the peoples'
a ill. I am told this platform will de
feat me. still I do not care to win on
my other. I intend to run this race
inder true colors.
While all the men opposing me are
,ood men. I offer the following rea
ens, which I believe justify me in
seeking this office.
1st. During -these times of trouble
alcng the border an experienced sher
iff should not be changed. It took me
three years to attain my best effl
ienc). likewise It took my deputies
he same period to learn the country
the criminals, and also to acquaint
themselves with officers of other
states Including Sonora, and to form
friendships with these foreign offl
ials. 2nd. Due to a great extent to the
personal friendship of higher Sonora
rfficlals, especial care has been given
our county by said officials. Cochise
county is the border county so far
free of bandit raids or molestation.
3rd. My last year's expenses show
ed a decrease of seven thousand dol
lars over the previous year and we
kept under our estimated budget three
thousand dollars less than Maricopa
county.
4th. The State Examiner, in his
report, said of my office: "It is pro
bably the best kept in the state."
5th. In four years, of fifty capital
offenders, but seven have escaped,
while Cochise county Is the only coun
ty from the Coast to Texas which has
not permanently lost one automobile
by theft.
6th. I will not be a candidate next
election for this office. I therefore
as my friends, who gave me nearly
four to one majority last election,
without the lot of a single precinct.

URATE FOR BENEFIT
OF
Constable Lafe Gibson, of Gleeson.
Ilk wise one of the chief boosters
f that live little mining, camp, was in
.he city today on business matters,
and while here made It known that
Gleeson is to have one big time on the
19th of next month for the benefit of
the candidates for office in Cochise
county, when they will be given an
opportunity of meeting the "punchers"
of the range, as well as the cattlemen
Df the count), who will be present In
numbers not small
Mr. Gibson stated that the big time
planned will far surpass an) other
held heretofore, and a big feature of '
the day will be a big free barbecue
everybody. Wild west sports will
constitute a chief part of the program
planned, and it might not be amiss to '
state, according to Booster Gibson,
that some "classy" horses have been i
secured for these events, and some of '
the best riders in the couny will be
there for the riding and roping events.
Other sports for the children and a
general, program for a good time not
forgetting the free barbecue and last,
but not the least, one of those good
old fashioned Gleeson dances in the
night, with the Ivey Orchestra, of
Tombstone, furnishing the music
"August 19th. Is no special holiday
or anything else," said Constable
Booster Gibson, "but we have ar
ranged fcr this big time so that every
body In our section ran come and meet
the various candidates for office, and
and so that the candidates can meet
I the people."

COVERED BORDER
.CREDITS CRITICISM ON
' JURY PANEL
Judge Lockwood. of the Superior
Court, having beard that some critl
cism had been attached t o Sheriff
Wheeler regarding the present jury
personnel at this term of court, dis
crediting all criticism, in an interview
today stated to a Prospector repre
sentative "Having heard that some criticism
has been dealt Sheriff Wheeler at this
term of court. I desire to state that
Sheriff Wheeler or nobody else ha
bad a thing to do with the selectio:
of the present jur) panel, but that I
order to give the drawn trial Jury lav
a fair trial, so that the people could
see it's workings, all jurors on thr
present panel have been drawn from
the Great Register of the county
"Owing to the fact that the liquor
selling cases were to be heard, the
court had all juries drawn from the
box in order that no one could have
the excuse that the jury had been
"packed" for either side, and so far
all names on the panel have been
drawn. This list 'Is about exhausted,
however, and we will then have to go
back to the open venire There Is
no reason why criticism should be at
tached to the Sheriff or an) one else
mi the present panel, and I want to
set aside any talk to that effect b)
this statement, which I hope will clear
up the w hole matter. Sheriff Wheeler
merely subpoenaes the men when the
names are given him. and in no way
Is ba or anyone connected with their
selection, and Captain Wheeler de
serves neither praise nor blame, re
garding the present panel.
' It Is only fair that I should dis
"rdlt this false Impression, and I an",
glad to be able to do so
"As soon as this list is exhausted,
howere," continued the Judge, "we
a ill go back to the open venire, ow
ing to the faulty law, which only al
lows a panel of 50 at any one time.
Wo hope to have It amended at the
next legislature, however, and when It
is, f believe that we will all agree that
the fawn jury system will work out
tr the ratisfactlon of all."

start from December 1, 1915, the date
on which his accomplice, Pablo Ra
mirez, was sentenced, and he will be
taken to Florence by the sheriffs of

IL CAUSES
TROUBLE ON NOGALES
RAILROAD
TUCSON. July 28. A sagging rail,
caused by sldewashing of the embank
ment on the Nogales branch at Soto's
crossing 45 miles south of Tucson, was
responsible for the derailment of an
Espee engine yesterday morning at 2
o'clock, according to advices received
at the superintendent's office later In
he morning.
When a report was received We3
csday evening that the steam shovel
at Chavez gravel pit was in danger of
eing submerged on account of the
recent heavy rains. Superintendent
litzgerald dispatched a work train
with a force of men to pull the steam
-ngine on the spur Into the pit out of
danger.
After working for some time the en
gine gave out of water and the crew
cut it off to go to Tubac, where there
is a water tauk.
At Soto's crossing there is a culvert
and the flood water in approaching
the bridge had ""side-washed" the em
bankment to such an extent that the
rail next to the flood sagged. When
passing over this point the 'engine
suddenly overturned. Neither Engi
neer Dorrance nor his fireman were
hurt.
