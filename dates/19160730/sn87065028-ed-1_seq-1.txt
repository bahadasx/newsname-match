Ceorgia, western Florida, Alabama
and Mississippi, and rust is reported
in Mississippi. The crop is not
fruiting well in Georgia and it de
teriorated materially in South Car
olina. The fields are grassy in much
of the central and eastern section.
Boll weevils have increased in much
of this district, although they . are
less numerous in Texas.

however; it made an improvement
over the last week in the highlands
of Alabama; made fair progress in

western Mississippi. The weather
was favorable for the crop in Ar
kansas, except in some of the hill
lands where rain is needed; it is
blooming and there is a fine pros
pect in Oklahoma, although some
sections need rain; it is doing well
and opening rapidly in Texas, and
the crop is in good condition in most
sections of Louisiana. Picking and

ROBERT CLEED, WHO ONCE
REPRESENTED THIS COUN
TY IN SENATE, EXPIRES.
Robert Gleed, a negro, who repre
sented Lowndes county in the Mis
siasippi state senate during the per
icd immediately following the civ. I
war, when members of his race dom
inated local politics, died Wednesday
in Parii, Texas, and his body was
broi.ght here for burial, the funeral
liuving occurred Fri.'py.,
Gleed was a leader among locil
negroes during the turbulent times
which follovvod the tlore of the
Ceniewenc struggle, anu when, tn-t
1875, white citizens, after having
killed seven recalcitrant blacks, re
gained control of the political ma
chine,, he fled to Paris. He lafer
came back to Columbus, but the re
ception given him was anything but
cordial, and he soon returned to the
Texac city, where remained until
the end of his earthly career.
Gleed was about 80 years old, and
is believed to have been the last re
maining negro who has served Lown
des couity in an office which is now
filled by honorable and distinguish
ed white citizens.
Raiting of Broom Corn.
In these days when storms and boll
weevils are making it exceedingly
difficult to raise cotton at a profit,
residents of rural communities are
turning to other vocations as a
means of earning a livelihood, and
Bob Williams, a negro, living six
miles west of Columbus has found
the raising of broom corn to be a
profitable industry. Last year Wil
liams had two and one half acres of
land planted in broom corn, and af
ter gathering his crop made it into
brooms, which he sold on the local
market. These brooms found a ready
sale and brought him in a total of
$160.00.
This year the negro has about
eight acres planted fn broom corn, j .
and hopes to make a larger sum
than he did last season.

CHANCELLOR TAYLOR OVER.
RULES MOTION TO DISSOLVE
IN ORAL ORDER.
Jackson, Miss., July 29. Chancel
lor O. B. Taylor on Thursday after
noon rendered a decision in the pro
hibition amendment referendum in
junction case, in which he upheld
every contention of the prohibition
advocates.
Some three weeks ago petitions
were filed with the secretary of
state calling for a referendum elec
tion upon the laws passed by the re
cent session of the Legislature, lim
iting the amount of whiskey brought
into the state by any one person to
one quart every fifteen days, and
prohibiting the publication of liquor
advertisements. At the same time a
referendum petition was filed ask
ing for an election on the
game and fiuh law paed at the
same session. The Anti-Saloon Lea
gue sued out an injunction restrain
ing the secretary of state from tak
ing any action whatever.
The secretary of state filed his
answer and made a motion to have
the injunction dissolved. Chancellor
Taylor in a verbal decision announc
ed that he would overrule the motion
to dissolve the injunction and that
as the supreme court would finally
have to decide all of the points in
the case anyway, he would render no
written decision. The fish and game
law was not included in the decision,
out attorneys on either side of the
litigation agreed to abide by the
decision in the liquor cases.
The attorney general announced
that he would file an appeal to be
presented to the supreme court
when it convenes on October 16.
The cases have been made prefer
ence litigation and a final decision is
expected in time for the question to
be voted on at the November elec
tions. The effect of the chancellor's de
cision was to hold that the referen
dum amendment was never legally
adopted and that therefore there
could be no election called under its
provisions.

Philadelphia, W. S. A. Smith, of
Sioux City, la., and Herbert Quick,

Agreement to this suggestion ii
expected and it wa tited officially
In. t nik'bt that the American mem
bers would be appointed and as
sembled at some point in the United
States at an early date.
Following is the full text of Act
ing Secretary Polk's note, after it
had been approved by President Wil
son and his cabinet:
Sir; I have the honor to acknowl
edge the receipt of your communi
cation of July 12, last, in which you
transcribe a note addressed to me
by the secretary of foreign relations
of your government, and to request
that you be good enough to trans
mit to him the following reply:
Mr. Secretary: I have the honor
to acknowledge receipt of your ex
cellency's note transmitted under
date of July 12 by Kliseo Arredon
do, your fcoveriimeii ctuiiiucu-iui
agent in Washington, informing me
that your excellency has received
instruction from the citizen first
chief of th Constitutionalist army
narged with the executive power of
tiie union to propose that each of
our governments name three com-OiU-.sioners
who shall hold conferen
ces at some place to be mutually
.'creed upon and decide forthwith
the question relating to the evacua
tion of the American forces now in
Me: ico, and to draw up and con
dude a proefoeol or agreement re
garding the reciprocal crossing of
the frontier by the forces of both
countries, also to determine the
origin of the incursions to dates, in
order to fix the responsibility
therefor and definitely to settle the
difficulties now pending or those'
which may arise between the twj
countries on account of the jm
or a similar reason, all of which will
be subject to the approval of both
eovertimeiits.
In reply, I have the honor to
state that I have laid your excel
lency's note before the President
and have received his instruc lions
to inform your excellency that the
government of the Unite! States is
disposed u accept the proposal 4
the Mexican government in the eme
spirit of frank cordiulity in which it
is maile. This government believes,
and suggests, however, that the
powers of the proposed commission
should be enlarged so that, if happi
ly, a solution satisfactory to both
governments of the question set
forth in your excellency's communi
cation may be reached, the com
mission may also consider such 7thr
mr.tters the friendly arrangement of
which would tend to improve the
friendly relations of the two coun
tries; it being understood that such
recommendations that the commis
sion may make shall not be binding
(upon the respective governments un
til formally accepted by them.
Should this proposal be accepta
ble to your excellency's government,
I have the honor to state that this
government will proceed immediate
ly to appoint its commissioners, and
fix, after consultation with your ex
cellency's government, the time and
place and other details of the pro
posed conferences.
Accept, Mr. Secretary, the assur
ances of my highest consideration.
