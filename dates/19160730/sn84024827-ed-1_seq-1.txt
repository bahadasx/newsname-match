force of the explosion was so
great that thousands of heavy
plate glass windows in office
buildings in lower Manhattan and
Brooklyn were shattered. Streets
for many blocks in the downtown
section were literally strewn with
broken glass. '
NEW YORK. July 30. Thousands
of peisr.ns swarmed into the streets

cussion which was felt more severely

taken by the police to prevent loot
ing houses which had been vacated
by frightened tenants. Elevated trains

bridges were shaken and many panes
of glass in the cars were broken. The
same was true of surface cars in all
paHs of the city.

by broken glass. A series of less se

STILL WEEP
OVER FRYATT'S DEATH
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. July 29 The foreign of
fice today published the communica
tion it sent to the American ambassa
dor, Walter II. Page, concerning the
case of Captain Fryatt. The commu
nication states:
"His majesty's government finds it
difficult to believe that a master of
a merchant vessel, who. after a Ger
man submarine had adopted the prac
tice of sinking merchant vessels with
out regard for the lives of the pas
sengers or crew, took the step which
appeared to afford the only chance
of saving not only his vessel but the
lives of all on board, can be shot
deliberately in cold blood for this ac
tion. "If the German government has in
fact. perpetrated such a crime in the
case of a British subject held pris
oner by them, it is evident that a
most serious condition of affairs has
arisen.
"The foreign secretary, therefore,
is obliged, on behalf of the govern
ment, to request that an urgent in
quiry map be made by the United
States embassy in Berlin as to wheth

tain Fryait Is true, in order that the
