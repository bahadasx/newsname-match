This young lady began work a few
years ago in the office of her brother,
who was doing an insurance and loan

with his many other business ven

concluded to quit the field, and turn

majority of men would, that she would
soon be out of it permanently herself.
Miss Hal took another view of the

HEAT WAVE CONTINUES.
With absolutely no pronounced op
position, the bond Issue for water and
sewer connections and a convention
hall, it is taken for granted that tho
election tomorrow will carry over
whelmingly. It is being predicted that
i goud vote will be cast, for as Uoy
Johnson puts it: "Nothing could give
Ardmore a bigger and better boost to
outside capital than a vo of confi
dence by Ardniore itself." And that
is what it. will amount to.
Every citizen of Ardmore appre
ciates the fact that the local men who
have made money in oil here arc at
the back of the greater Ardmore
movement which is fast crystali.ing
and will be launched In full force this
fall. These men are the biir taxnav-
ers of the city, and are all for the
bonds.
Such men as Chas. von Weise, Bert
Simpson, P. C. Tings, Wirt Franklin,
Ed Gait, Uoy Johnson, S. A. Apple,
Kirk Dyer, Mark Kirkpatrick, and
many others are outspoken in their
convictions that the necessary public
improvements for a city to grow must
be provided.
Great stress is being laid on the
fact that despite the big asset the oil
industry is to Ardmore, it has n.'u-
