Stripling. on November t, shot
and killed W. J. Cornett, his neighbor
in Harris County. i!;i. He tired through
;i witidow of Cornell's house He fir
:ondered at Columbus 'la. a few 'iavs
afterward, and eventually was found
f.-u111>* and senteri'.ed to life imptison
nieut.
Stripling testified .it :l.e tr.al- . *ni it
was i-orrobot ated - that t'oinett h.>d in
sulted both lits wife and married sister;
that Cornett had threatened to kill
him. ami that, when passing Cornell's'
house ttic night of the killing, he could
not restrain himself fioin shooting
when he saw Cornett passing a window
with a light in his hand. He claimed
?elf-deiense. as lie said he believed "it
was either Cornett's life or mine some
time."
lie escaped from the Harris County
Jail when his case was awaiting tho
outcome of an appeal. lie remained
hidden about two months at the home
iif his uncle in Harris County and then
made his way t?. l-'orth Carolina, where
his wife joined him in DIi9. L'nder the
name c-f H. IS. Morris, he did different
iitids of work in several towns for a
number of years. Finally he was em
nloyed by the Southern Railway as a
special agent. That work took him to
Danville, where he had been about one
vear when he obtained a place on the
police force. Nine months later he was
??lected chief of police.

Stripling has said there were two men
in Danville who knew his life story,
but they remained silent. Finally ;i
man well known in Harris County saw
him, and soon afterwards reports as to
Stripling's whoreahouts were heard.
These reports seemed to W. \V. Smith,
a private deteetive, to warrant Investi
gation. lie obtained requisition papers
from Governor Rrown and proceeded
to Danville. Smith established the
identification beyond doubt.
(in March 4, 1011, the Danville Coiin
il was to elect a chief of police, and
It is said Stripling was practically
assured of re-election, notwithstanding'
some opposition had arisen because he
killed a young white man who had
resisted arrest, killed a negro who was
(tempting to rob his home and shot
mother negro while resisting arrest.
. |e was exonerated of blame in each
ase.
mi the afternoon of March 3. how
? \er. Smith presented the requisition
,apers to Danville authorities. Strip
ing was confronted with the fact, and
idniitted his Identity. Stripling re
Hiested the Mayor and members of
'outicll, who at that time were un
.wave of his plight, to meet that
light, as he had an important state
nent to make. Before the body that
nobiibly would have elected him chief
for another term the next night ho
tood handcuffed and lold the story of
he shooting of "Illll" Cornett, of his
escape and movements during the
nearly fourteen yoars of frewlom. He
<till wore his uniform when placed in
jail In Georgia.
Ills family moved to Milledgevilln
soon after he was sent to the prison,
and has resided near the prison farm
since. Stripling Is now represented as
being .thoroughly broken physically.

J moiit from Washington that, in tlie
j light of Sir Cecil Spring-Itlce's report
that the admiral in charge of Hritish i
warships patrolling off Cape Henry had
denied that an English cruiser was j
within the Virginia capos last Tues
day morning, the "mystery-ship" inci
dent would not be a subject of inquiry !
or protest, caused discussion of it to
! wane to-day in naval circles.
Olllccrs of the Louisiana, who re- i
| ported to the Navy Department that!
Ian unidentified ship signaled them that j
she was an Knglish cruiser, made no
attempt, however, to conceal their
satisfaction over the report of Lieu
tenant-Commander Shane, of the naval
collier Neptune, sent yesterday to
Washington. Ills statement that he!
saw n ship hearing man-of-war lights'
exchanging signals with the Louisiana)
and later saw her emerge from the;
Virginia capes was regarded as cor-1
roboration of their reports.
With the mystery-ship flurry appar
ently passed, attention again has turned
to the Deutschland, and few seafaring
men here think she will leave until
the fate of the Hremen lias been defi
nitely settled.

A decision by a German prize court
[ that the Appam was a lawful prize was
held to bo without effect upon proceed
i ings of the courts of the United States.
The same German court recently ad
judged prize money, some STaO.OOO in
gold, taken from the Appam when she
was captured off the coast of Spain by
the raider Moewe.
Following the lengthy opinion of
thirty-two typewritten pages is the
following conclusion of the court:
"The court's conclusion is that the
manner of bringing the Appam into
the waters of the United States, as well
as her presence in those waters, con
stitutes a violation of the neutrality
j of the United States; that she came in
j without bidding or permission; that she
is here in violation of law; that she is
unable to leave for lack of a crew,
| which she cannot provide or augment
without further violation of neutrality;
'that in her present condition she is
without a lawful right to be and re
main in these waters; that she, as be
! tween her captors and owners, to all
practical intents and purposes, must
bo treated as abandoned and stranded
upon our shores; that her owners are
[ entitled to restitution of their property,
which this court should award, irrespec
tive. of the prise court proceedings of
the court of the imperial government
of the German empire, and it will be
so ordered."
The appeal to the. Supreme Court of
the United States will he noted by
counsel for the German government
next Wednesday at noon, when the
court will sit for the purpose of hcar
; ing the motion of counsel for the Brit
[ ish government in regard to bonding

i As soon as the details of the bond

I .Special to The Times-Dispatch.]
XKW VOItlC. July 2!).?The death
record in the it) fa utile paralysis epi
demic reached a new high mark to
day. Forty-four victims were claimed.
This was an increase of eleven over
yesterday's figures. X'ow cases re
ported totaled 1(11, and it became ap
parent that a change in temperature
makes no difference in the progress of
the disease. The number of new eases
to-day has been exceeded only twice
since the beginning "f the epidemic.
The board of health's weekly bulle
tin gave the grand total of new cases
as r,.:.vs. and T33 deaths. Health Com
missioner Ktnerson declared these fig
ures d!il not indicate any sudden lack
of control of the disease.
Dr. John S". Hillings, in charge of the
Brooklyn otllce, said the disease seemed
to be "burning Itself out" in that bor
ough.
l)r. W'iide J/, Crops, of the Public
Health Service, has advanced the theory
that infantile paralysis i.s a .self
limited disease, said Dr. Billings. "He
holds it apparently goes through a
community ami feeds upon those who
are susceptible, and that when it burns
itself out of available material. It de
clines and disappears. Since it is evi
dent that all children are not suscepti
ble, its ravages are not nearly so wide
spread as in some other diseases "
The number of out-of-town patho
logists accepting ?'ommlssiotier Kmer
soii's Invitation to come to New York
and study infantile paralysis has been
increased to seven. Acceptauces w ere

More Than ilo.ooo Captured.
Armies of thf? entente allies continue
to hammer the linos of the central
powers on all Kuropean fields. On the
western front the Itritish ami French
are holding hack Gorman forces, and
Itritish troops have mailc additional
progress osi the hard-fought Sonunc
battle ground.
"With Rrody in their hands, the Rus

Northern C!al!ela. In Southern Galicia,
however, the Muscovite armies are
pushing: forward toward Stanislau, an
important railroad center, which is not
far from llalicz, also a railroad een

The capture of Rrody and the re
treat of the Austrian army is equaled,
if not surpassed, l>y the Russian suc
cesses west and northwest of T.utsk.
This advance, if unchecked by Gen
eral von Idnslngen, seriously threatens
Vladimir-Volynski and makes the rail
road junction of KoVel less tenable for
the Austro-Ocrman forces.
Whllo admitting- the Russian pene

of Rutsk, Rerlin declares that the ad

by a counterattack.

the present campaign by the Russians
totals SfiO.oilO. The same authorities
estimate the Aust ro-German losses, in

North of the Homme, in 1"ranee, the
Itritish have valued some ground In
the vicinity of Pozieres and the llig'h

German attacks auainst Delville wood,
and the French have stopped German
attempts to advance at Vcrtnandovil

ports little activity on this front, with
the exception of the failure of Itritish
attacks in the vicinity of Pozieres.
Fighting also continues around Ver
dun. German attacks on both the
right and left banks of the Mouse have
been repulsed. Paris asserts. French
troops continue their advance near the
Thiaumont work, on the right bank of J
the river.
There has been no great change onj
the A ust ro-1 talian front, nor on the 1
