Fngene I-orton, editor of the World, 1
yesterdny issued the following state-'
inent with reference to the nomina-1
tlon of two Republican candidates for1
the state legislature from this county: I
"O.i the state ballot that will be
given each voter next Tuesday will ap
pear the names of five candidates for j
stale representative from Tulsa coun
ty. I had understood that all but two.
if there had withdrawn from the
race, and i.m unable to explain why 1
their names sti'l appear on the ballot.
I believe It to be to the best Interest
of the Republican party and the coun
ty as a whole, to nominate Harry H. '
P.Of-ers nnd illenn Condon for these
plaees. They are well known and will
make Ftrnng candidates.. They will
gre.itlv help the entire ticket and both :
of them will be elected. If nominated, (
as they will receive slmort as many i
Democratic votes as Republican votes.
I trust that the Republicans of the
county will kerp this in mind an I
nominate these two men at the C'tn-

It cost the state of Oklahoma over
J75.00O to hold the special ses
sion of the legislature to enact the
literacy test iaw which is to be rati
fied, if It is ratified, not by tho voters
of tho state voting', but by those not
voting, either through oversight, in
difference or Ignorance. And yet the
framers of this law have the nerve
to designate It as a 'literacy test"
law. On a straight out yes and no
vote it would bo overwhelmingly re
jected. Hut this Is not tho only
iniiiuilous l:i,v the special session en
acted. It is gratifying to know that
not all the Democrats of tho state
were In favor of the extra session
and the thingt it did. Wo recall that
Senator Rolxrt Ia Davidson of Tulsa
county told I lie governor in a letter
previous to tho callmg of the extra
session what would happen and op
posed the move. After the session
was over his letter seemed like a
prophecy. If there were no other
reason for opposing the literacy test
law except the manner In which it is
sought to have It sneaked through,
that would be sufficient for all patri
otic citizens to give it a swat. But
when the other vicious laws which
were enacted at the special session
are recalled, every Just and fair
mir.dtd citizen must be consumed
with a feeling of resentment at the
Democratic machine in this state.
Under the specious plea for literacy
tho illiterate and Indifferent voters
are depended upon to enact the law.
What rot? What fraud? Muh!
The claim that tho literacy test law

out in uncuulN ocal terms in favor of
Mr Parkinson for the nomination fur
corporation commissioner on tho It
publican ticket. Ills signed statement
lollows:
Frank A. Parkinson of Law
ton, kla., is a candidate for the
Republican nomination for corpo
ration commissioner for the long
term.
No man has ever been a candl
iato for this office who is more
alie. more capable or better
qualified to fulfill tho obligations
thereof and discharge its duties
than Mr. Parkinson. He Is one
of Oklahoma's most able men and
no one has a more thorough
knowledge of the affairs of the
stato or Is better fitted to dis
charge the duties of any office
than Mr. Parkinson.
tic is a thorough believer In
tne principles of the Republican
party and has always been an act
ive supporter and worker for
those principles, but he does not
condemn or abure people who dif
fer from him in their political
lieliefs, and he believes that tho
great majority of voters of Okla
homa, Republican, Democratic
and Socialist, all desire fair and
iP'partliil laws and fair and im
partial enforcement of thesamo.
If Mr. Parkinson Is nominated by
a member of the corporation com
mission all people of whatever
nolitieal faith can rest assured
that tho duties of that offlco
will be faithfully, honestly and
impartially performed, and tha
rights of all who come within tha
commission's Jurisdiction will be
honestly and fairly protected.
If r. Parkinson is nominated by
the Republicans for this offies
his wide acquaintance through
out the state and his well known
qunllficatilons of ability, hon
esty, integrity and fairness will
attract to him not only the Re
publican voters, but nil fair
minded Democrats and Socialists
who desire a change of adminis
tration, or who believe that tuch
a commission as the corporation
commission with its power, au
thority and varied interests,
should not be composed entire
ly of members of one political
party.
Thousands of Mr. Parkinson's
friends throughout the stale are
pressing him to le a candidate for
the Republican nomination for
governor two years heni-e, know
ing that he possesses the states
manship and executive rbllity re
quired for that gnat office, and
sincerely and thoroughly believ
ing that he will give the state of
Oklahoma an administration far
surpassing In every way any that
has fs yet governed in Oklahoma.

The presumption that this consent

that they are not merely passive allies
of Great Britain In the blacklist pro
gram, but were active in their Inslst
ance that Great Britain follow the
same policy which they had already
put Into practice.
It has been something of a shock to
several members of the administration
to learn that French has long had In
