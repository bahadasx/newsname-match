i ii,,. French ntnbassailor
U
yVaihington iin.l lo the other French
,epresctil'itlv in neutral countries,
directing them to protest to the gov
ernments to which they lire accredit -.
.I i note reading as follows:
' sk yon to call the iittenllon to
winch von are accredited to the treat
ment which the populations of Lille,
Kimikilx and Turcoing have l.een sub
jected hv the (iernian authorities.
The French government in the
presence of revealed facts invokes the
application of article 111, of The
Hague convention concerning laws
and customs of conducting land war
fare, to the end that (lennatiy he
held responsible for violations of
these rules l.y lis armed forces.
"I'ntil a decision of arms has per
mitted the reconquering of these oc
cupied regions, the sole means of mak
ing this effort is hy pressing all appeal
in the sentiments of Justice and hu
manity of neutral powers and the pub
lic opinion of all nations.
Protest 1m Made.
"I therefore ask you, in presenting
this note, to ask the government lo
give il the most serious attention as it
constitutes the protest of the French
government against tin1 conditions
which it brings to the attention of the
civilized world, supported hy lesti
inonv from many sources."
Alter reciting- the efforts made hy
the government through the Spanish
government to stop the Oermnn prac
tice in invi.dcJ regions, the docu
ment adds:
' Today, all out protests having heen
in vain, we place the evidence hefore
the eyes of neutral powers, assured
of the judgment that universal cnii
n'ience will pass upon such conditions
anil that it will he incumheiit on the
Herman government, in case il under
takes to question this evidence to per
mit an impartial Inquiry. To this end
the t lerman government must author
ize the neutral powers To conduct an
investigation, notably of the events
occurring at I.llle, Roubuix and Tur
cuing and surrounding communes
from the L''jnd to the iiHth of April,
lliU!. If they refuse to authorize an
Inquiry, it will he a recognition of the
veracity of the fads denounced."
The note is accompanied hy a mass
of testimony concerning the seizure of
work in the fields of thousands of
women and young girls. The docu
ment says that the events which oc
curred at Lille, Koiilmix arid Tureoin"
were only the application of the cruel
system of work forced on the popula
tion, ,-i ml describes the various forms
of violence the (iermans are accused
of having practiced.
Instances Filed.
The note says:
"A woman who was removed
Ardennes, affirms that her husband
was shot for refusing to obey an nr
!er to requisition supplies and that
i he herself was imprisoned for two
da vs.
"In F. , Mcurthe and Moselle,
work assigned lo the mayor being nn-
ompleteil in time, he was suspended
ti'iiin a tree by means of a rope passed
under his arms and he was left in this
position about an hour."
The note cites cases of men seventy
to eighty years of age made to work;
of women forced to labor under I be
fire of French troops and of others
compelled to dig trenches. It also
makes a charge based on the testi
mony of n witness, that in October,
If 1-1, the Cermans took from the de
partment of Pas do Calais a parly of
inhabitant." that they used them as
shields against the fire of the French
and that forty were thus killed.
The document says the Ccrman
"overiiment on .January 'J4, llHtl, de
nied mistreatment of inhabitants, but
