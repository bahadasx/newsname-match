Believed Destroyed.
NEW YORK, July 30 (Sunday).?Thirty-three
Jersey City
firemen are reported to have been
killed early this morning by a terrific
explosion in the plant of the
National Storage Company on
Black Tom Island near- Communipaw,
N. J., where they had
gone to fight a fire resulting from
a terrific explosion just thirty
minutes earlier.
In the' storage company plant
ate said to have been enormous
quantities of ammunition consigned
to the entente allies. The
1 nlant ic ranArtad fn kaira !
: been wrecked. The island appeared
at 3130 o'clock to be covered
with a sheet of flame. Access
to it is gained from the mainland
by a bridge, over which run tracks
of the Central Railroad of New
Jersey.
Sixty-Bine Carloads of Ammunition.
Sixty-nine carloads of ammunition
are said to have been
stored in railroad tracks on the
jsland. All of them are believed
to have been blown up. .
Edmund L. Mackerzie, president
of the National Storage
Company, said at his home at
Plainfield, N. J., at 3:40 o'clock
this morning that he had just received
a telegram informing him
that a great fire was raging in
the plant of his company, following
an explosion.
The plant of the storage company
consists of about twentyfive
warehouses and three or four
covered piers, one of which is a
powder pier, and Mr. Mackenzie
exolained that there were no com
-bustibles in the warehouses. I le j
expressed the belief from the |
meager information he had received
that the explosion must
have been in trains of munitions
which had been run to the powder
docks, awaiting removal on
lighters to ships anchored in the
bay. He declared the plant was
valued at about $7,000,000.
Blazing Munition Barges Afloat.
Dr. Joseph Wilson of Immigration
Hospital on Ellis Island reported to '
Manhattan police headquarters at 3:45 j
this morning that two barges loaded with !
ammunition lying alongside the dock at i
Ellis Island were ablaze from stem to :
stern. He said they had drifted down !
the bay from the direction of Stater: !
Island. Black Tom Island is about a i
quarter of the way from Ellis Island to j
Staten Island. The patients in the Ellis j
Island Hospital were ordered transferred
to another island of the Ellis Island j
group.
All Manhattan Island was shaken by
the explosions. Windows of buildings all
over the lower end of the island were
shattered.
Thousands Thrown Into Panic.
Thousands of persons swarmed into
the streets In all parts of the city
from buildings, subway exits and railway
stations, running about In a
panic. Many women became hysterical.
Polite whistles were blown frantically,
but the police themselves did not know
wh>?t if was all about.
The first explosion was followed I
-by a second, blighlly lens violent, {
but which again shooK all New York :
and shattered many more buildings.
The thousands who had flocked to the
streets after the first ^explosion were
reinforced by thousands more after the
second. Men, women and children left
their hemes in their night clothing.
Many declared they had been thrown
'cf of bed by the force of the concussion.
which was felt even tnore
severely in Brooklyn than in New York.
Women who were in Brooklyn streets
when the first explosion occurred were
thrown to tae pavement and many of
them became almost crazed with fear.
I
Hospital Patients Alarmed.
Guests In the bis uptown hotels ran
frantically Into the corridors when the
windows in their rooms were shattered.
Patients in ail the city hospitals were
j greatly alarmed and their attendants
j experienced maeh difficulty in quieting
them. Prompt action was taken by the
police to prevent looting in building?
which had been vacated by frightened
tenants.
Nearly all the fire apparatus in
Brooklyn was called out in the belief
that somewhere in that part of the city
there was a great fire, but no trace of
j one was to be found.
Police headquarters in Manhattan express
the belief that many thousands
1 of dollars* damaee had bepn nanspd in
this city by the explosion, it was conjectured
that the combinations of
vaults in the financial district might
have been so seriously imaged that
difficulty would " be experienced in
opening them.
Trains on Bridge Shaken.
Elevated trains crossing Brooklyn
bridge and other bridges were shaken
and many panes of glass in the cars
were broken. The same was true of
surface cars in all parts of the city.
Panic was most pronounced among
the dwellers in crowded East Side tenements,
and many of those who hastened
into the streets were cut by broken
glass.
Fears for the safety of persons traveling
beneath the North river tubes of
the Hudson and Manhattana Railroad
Company were set at rest soon after
3 o'clock by a report from the trainmaster's
office in the Hudson terminal
uuuuuig ma.L me property or tne company
had. not been damaged.
Shocks Felt in Pholadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa.. July 30.?
Operators on duty in the electrical bureau
at City Hall here reported: that
windows in the big building rattled
from two distinct shocks from the
Jersey City explosion. Many inquiries !
came into police stations from residents
in the northeastern part of
Philadelphia.
The explosion was felt at Camden.
N. J., opposite this city, and at Bristol,
Pa. Telephone inquiries into Philadelphia
said the shock was plainly felt.
Bristol is sixty-six miles from Jersey
City and Camden nearly ninety miles.

man Would Be Bad Precedent
to Establish.
Special protection for the German
merchant submarine Deutschland when
she starts out of American territorial
waters was asked of the American government
late yesterday, with the intimation
that the boat ^ould leave Baltimore
some time today. After conferences
between State. Treasury and
Navy departments officials it was ruled
that no extraordinary precautions
could be ordered, because the United
States view3 the Deutschland as an ordinary
merchantman.
Officials, with the ostensible purpose
of avoiding any breach of neutrality,
withheld all information which imightj
be of value to the watching allied?
cruisers, but it was understood that the i
government was made aware of the im- j
pending departure of the Deutschland
and there was at least an intimation
that the submarine wanted protection
in American waters.
Applied ThrouglT XT. S. Collector.
It is understood that the application
for protection was made through the ;
collector of customs at Baltimore, and j
that Capt. Koenig, the submarine com- j
mander, desired a coast guard cutter j
or naval vessel to escort him down :
Chesapeake bay and to the three-mile >
limit. Unless steps are taken to pre- !
vent it, the submarine probably will be 1
followed out by a fleet of small craft j
carrying newspaper correspondents, I
photographers and sightseers.
It is said, too, that the Germans fear j
some British merchant ship might go to
sea in the wake of the Deutschland, ad-*
vertising her presence to the allied cruisers
waiting off the Virginia capes or
even attempting to ram her as soon as
she left American territorial waters.
Would Be Bad Precedent.
Officials of the State Department held
that, while American neutrality must be
fully safeguarded, it would be a. bad
precedent for the government to convoy
or accord any other unusual attention
to a vessel which can be rated only as
a merchantman.
Precautions already have been taken
to see that the submarine Is not molested
within the three-mile limit. Since '
the reported incursion of a British !
cruiser between the Virginia capes last
week the armored cruiser North Carolina
and three destroyers have been patrolling
off Cape Henry.
The conferences yesterday were between
Acting Secretary Phillips of the
State Department. Secretary Daniels of
the Navy and officials of the customs
division of the Treasury.

Indications Are That Many of the

Verdun Region.
LONDON, July 29.?The importance
attached by the Germans
to the possession of Delville
wood is shown by the desperate
character of their constant counter
attack on this wood since
it was captured by the British.
These counter attacks, according'
to the British reports, have been
repulsed on every occasion with
heavy German losses.
In the neighborhood of Pozieres
also the British and Germans
continue in the closest grips, and
the severest hand-to-hand fight- 'ng's
f??'ng on incessantly. The w
British, however, maintain their I
advance toward the remaining "
portion of the rising ground between
Pozieres and Bapaume still
in the hands of the Gersmans.
Germans From Meuse Area.
t I o
Many German infantry limits with- 3
drawn from the IStcuse area have been
recognized in the forces opposing the
progress of the British. Thi3 is the
probably reason why the fighting
around Verdun, as shown by the
French reports, has developed into almost
purely artillery engagements. Intermittent
minor* infantry attacks,
however, have occurred there, initiated a
to
a' ernatel / . by either side, in which
the French report some success with a j se
gain in ground. i 1
"There is abundant evidence to show ^
that the Iossr-s inflicted by us on the j ^
enemy in the last few days have been
extremely severe, particularly in Delville
wood, where two or three regi- ^
ment.s appear to have been airnl- j
hilated."

The official statement issued by the ha

"There is nothing to report along the us

fairly lively cannonade on the right

Chapel of Sainte Fine. c<
"Aviation?On the morning of July 01
27 a French aeroplane piloted by Quar- m
termaster de Terline attacked a Ger- ol
man machine which was flying over di

Two of our machines saw de Terline w

De Terline had already brought down **
two enemy machines and had Just 8<

ecretary Baker Answers
Queries About Transportation
to the Border.
Secretary of War Baker yesterday made
report on the transportation of troops
the border in which he "answered the
veral resolutions of inquiry introduced
the House by Representative J. Hampn
Moore of Philadelphia, Representative
ad den of Illinois and others. In effect,
te reply of the Secretary was that all
>ssible care had been taken with Na>nal
Guardsmen and Jhkt if there had I
ten a lack of food anywhere it will
obably be traced to the inexperience
National Guard officers. He also said
at while in some cases the guardsmen
id been transported fh day coaches, no
rs without lights and water had been
led, and that no troop trains had been
ireasonablv sidetracked.
He asserted that the rations issued
ere those of the regular army. Where I
joking equipments were not placed
i trains, the men were furnished
ioney for coffee the same as troops
r the regular army under similar conitions.
Few Day Coaches Used.
The report states that day coaches
ere used only in cases where, owing
> the urgency of the situation and the
rge number of troops being moved at
te time, it was not practical to dey.
Where day coaches were assigned
jree men were placed in each four
iats. In some cases railroads with- ?
lit extra charge allowed two men to
>ur seats. Wherever possible the men
ere transferred from day coaches to
>urist cars.
"There was no reason for trooi>?m;eekg
food of citizens, en route," he adds. J
t. is not possible, unless rations have I
;en thrown away, that troops which
ive been reported short of rations
>uld have/been short. Evftry precauon
was taken to see that they started
1th an ample sup'.ly. The?e troops are
rgely recruits untrained and undisplined
and under officers of eompara-i
vely little eyp*rience."
Acting Q. M. Gen. Sharpe re>rted
that to have moved all the troops
i Pullman or tourist cars would have
squired 3,000 cars. The Pullman commy
made available for the troops 80
;r cent of all tourist cars it owns.
Commends Conditions on Border.
Representative Slayden, who all
irough the Mexican troubles has
een one of the administration's crit:s
for not using the guard on the
order, spoke in the House yesterday
i commendation of the condition of
\e guardsmen and conditions on the
order generally.
"We now have an army on the Mex:an
border and across the inter
ationai liuunmn j I?w nrn pi ejJareQ
>r any prospective duty that no clti;n
need Rive himself the slightest
neaslness as to what will happen,"
rid he.
Mr. Slayden declared troops had
een moved without hitch and with
11 dispatch necessary.
"These troops," he said, "were moved
safety and comfort even If Pullman
srths and nine-foot linen sheets could
it be supplied to all the men. If Pulfan
berths are to be supplied to all
ie men of the ever-Increasing armies
all their movements, it Is a new

iree nights in an ordinary day coach
ice or twice In a lifetime Is an enirable
hardship, and one that the

Chief Executive Gets Report
From Cruiser in From
the Capes.
FORT MONROE, Va.. July 29.?
President Wilson arrived here this
afternoon on the naval yacht Mayflower.
#The yacht anchored in the
roads and the President did not come
ashore.
iSoon after the Mayflower arrived
the armored cruiser North Carolina,
which has been patrolling outside the
capes on neutrality duty, steamed in
and dropped anchor within hailing distance.
There followed a long Exchange
of messages between Fort Monroe,
the Mayflower and the North Carolina,
wigwagging continuing until darkness,
when lights were substituted.
It is said that the President has no
definite plans, but probably will remain
in this vicinity until tomorrow
night and start for Washington in time
to reach there Monday morning.
The appearance of -the North Carolina
near the Mayflower and the signaling
to Fort Monroe almost coincident
with receipt of reports that the
German merchant submarine Deutschland
would sail tomorrow excited great
interest along the water front. About
.9 o'clock tonight two of the three destroyers
which have been off ,the entrance
of Chesapeake bay with the
North Carolina came into the roads
and joined in the signaling. '
The Mayflower mado the trip to
Hampton roads by easy stages down
the bay. The President and his party
saw several large sharks in the wake
of the yacht as she passed through the
lower bay.
Mr. Wilson has spent many hours of
the cruise with his stenographer, disposing
of a quantity of work, including
a part of his speech accepting the democratic
nomination for the presidency.

II Progiesso, Italian Newspaper,
in New York.
NEW YORK. July 29.?The business
office of the Italian newspaper II Progresso,
in this city, was wrecked tonight
by a mob which demanded that
the management of the papfcr begin a j
campaign to obtain freedom for Carlo 1
Tresca, a leader of the Industrial '
Workers of the World, who is im- 1
prisoned in Minnesota. Tresca is
awaiting trial, it is said, in connection 1
with the killing of a deputy sheriff j
about three weeks ago.
The notice assert that the mnh was 1 J
composed of members of the Industrial
Workers of the World, who had attended
a meeting: in Union Square 1
earlier in the afternoon, and had
listened to fiery speeches urging all
followers of Tresca to bring pressure ]
to bear on Italian newspapers to take 1
up his case. j
It was said at the newspaper office
that before the leaders of the mob had
seen Antonio Crocco, the manager, and '
stated what they wanted, the excited
men and women destroyed the office
furniture. They then went to the
editorial rooms, where their anger was
appeased. Leaving the building the .
rioters cheered the newspaper and
Tresca. ^
Shortly before the mob went to the a
newspaper office there was an incipient s
riot a block away, in which two po- a
licemen were injured. Police reserves s
rescued their fellow officers. Six C
prisoners were placed in commandeered j
automobiles and rushed to a police sta- <

In favor of putting the District

j with the half-and-half provision intact
was the only progress made on the belated supply
bll' in the upper house of Con- 3
gress yesterday, practically the entire
afternoon being consumed in speeches
of a political nature.
Despite the evident desire of Senator
Smith of Maryland, chairman of the
District committee of the Senate, to get
down to business on the bill, the Senate
became entangled in arguments on both
Kill tVio imrni
S.IUC13 Ktl lilts Cliliu iauu> - .
gration bill, and the effect of these
measures on party policies; it also heard s
a speech on the federal reserve board by
Senator Owen; Senator Poindexter, how- J3
ever, introduced his remarks on the subject
of immigration by a reference to his s
own measure providing for a vote in the
District. But no vote was taken on the s
proposed appeal from Vice President
Marshall's ruling that the Works amend- p
ment is in order on the bill.
This is the amendment which is aimed t
at abolishing the present form of government
in the National Capital and sub- A
stituting a form of federal territory, in
which all local taxes are paid into the
federal Treasury.
Makes 'Plea for Half-and-Half. y
^enator Gallinger continued the ?
speech he began Friday by making references
to the Works amendment and e
to the arguments advanced by Senator f
Works and Senator Chilton in support
thereof: S
"I am surprised," he Suid, "to hear g
senators say this is not a municipal
government, and I can, I think, cite a
federal statutes to prove to the con- j
trary."
Senator Chilton had said Friday that a
i the municipal government of the Dis
I trict is but an imaginary thing. Sena
tor Gallinger read the early statutes S
creating the District, wherein the ten ^
miles square is termed a municipal government.
t
"If the District of Columbia, were but
a mere state of mind," he said, "then I
these statutes would have to be re- *
pealed." '
Then the New Hampshire senator began
to speak of the District appropria- *
tions, and what they have been and /
Avhat they should be. v
Says Congress Is Parsimonious. r
He argued that this Congress and
previous congresses had been p-irsimonious
with the National Capital, and
that there are millions of dollars which ^
could be appropriated today for im- s
provements sorely needed by Washing- e
ton. ^
"I would make this city as attractive a
and as beautiful as any city on earth," ^
he sai'd. "In many resp'ects it is already ^
so, but there is much more to be done.
We ought to practice a real liberality; n
we ought not to haggle over the que4;- b
tion of whether we have appropriated ^
$2 too much, when in reality we are a
always appropriating too little." p
He referred to the subject of taxation, S
and said that the recent agitation on U
the subject had done no good to Wash- T
I ington: . i V
"An investigation was held recently." C;
i he said, "by a committee known as the I a
[George committee, which produced e;
I what is called the George report. It
I containing many of the single-tax ideas ?
of Mr. George, and was based mainly-..
! upon figures and testimony produced by fj
a man named Herbert J. Browne. The f
| Browne data have been utterly dis- ,
j proved by men who are in complete
' of the facts. ^
j '*D. C. Owes U. S. Nothing." J t
i "If Congress had been as liberal as it ^
! should have been and had appropriated a
as much as the District of Columbia 1
raised in taxes, there would have been ^
a
no faultfinding, and we would have a b
much better city. The District of Columbia
does not owe the federal gov- s
eminent a cent. In fact, there is a sur- ?
j plus which I believe belongs to the t!
| District, and not to the general gov- a
I eminent as some gentlemen believe."
[ {Speaking of the District bill as it |
went from the House abolishing the j
! half-and-half plan. Senator Ga'.linger j p
said: _ j ...
I "The House proposition is unfair v-id j
I unjust to the District, and we ought . '

fiHanM Would Stifle Growth. ts
I ~ " C1
Speaking of the amounts carried In c[
the bill, the senator called attention to a]
the niggardly amounts appropriated In jr
the House measure, and to the fact to
that the District asked for $1?,000,000 ^
for needed projects and regular ex- t_j,
penditures, while the House bill carried w
only a little more than $11,000,000. He j 1,1
also argued that with the growjh of
the city in ten -years the District
might be raising $10,000,000, and needing
the half-and-half plan to carry on
the progress of a greater Washington, r
and that to kill the half-and-half plan
now would stifle such growth.
"Let us instruct the senate conferees el
to stand firm," he said in conclusion. "I "
want to see this the most beautiful al
city of tile world; 1 want to see it sur- m
pass every other city in grandeur."
Senator Poindexter said that the Con- B:
stitution established the District of fr
Columbia and that Its government
could not be abolished. He also said *n
that he hoped to see a vote granted to be
the people of the District for the purpose
Of sending delegates to Congress

PETROGRAD, July 29 ?A
emi-official estimate of the num>er
of prisoners taken by the Rus
ians during the first half of the
ummer campaign just closing
laces the total at 350,000. The
otal Teutonic losses are estilated
at near 800.000.
After being compelled to halt
heir advance for several weeks %
iefore combined Austrian and
tci man icjjisidiitc uu kic huiui*
rn wing of Gen. BrussilofTs
ront, the Russians have again
cored an important success and
re pressing the Teutons back
long the. entire fropt from the
Covel-Lutsk railway, as far south
s Brody.
Although the official war office
tatement gives no particulars of
his new penetration of the Teuonic
lines, it apparently took
dace south of Kiselin, on the
/ladimir-Volvnski highway, and
vas a direct blow at the Austrojerman
army defending Vladinir-Volynski.
Breach Regarded ^Significant.
The unexpected widening of the breach
egun at Lutsk in the early days of the
ummer campaign that has thus been
fleeted is considered more significant
ban the occupation of Brody, which was
foregone conclusion some days ago.
'he fate of Brody was sealed when Gen.
akharofl scored his brilliant victory on
River Slonevka.
The new Russian attack south of Lutsk
ot only threatened Vladimir-Voly nski
nt nnens the possibility of a successful
ttack upon Kovel from the south, since
n important railway line connects these
oints. The proximity of the Russians to
okal likewise constitutes a definite
ireat at Lemberg from that direction,
'he chief significance of the new adance
is the fact that it is the first derisive
success scored by the Russians
gainst German forces in the present
ampaign.
Lose ?n 60-Mile Front.
Since ihe frst breach of the Lutsk
ront. the Germans, taking over the
lefensc of Kovel. had been able to
lold the Russians on the line of Jihe
'tokhod. The combined effect of the
wo Russian advances?toward Vladilir-Volynski
and toward Brody?now
as been to drive the Austro-German
rmies back along a sixty-mile front,
'he fall of Brody. however, has not as
et seriously awakened expectation of
n immediate pressing on to Lemberg ?
y the Russians.
Military critics call attention to the
trong natural and artificial defense*
rotecting the Galician capital. It is
xpected that the Austrians will ma's*
heir first stand in the forests irameditely
west of Brady ^alcng the bend in
he Stvr.
Taken by Infantry Rush.
According to semi-official infoi matron,
rody was taken without artillery preuaiti
'ii by an irresistible rush of the inmtry.
The onslaught was so sudden and
nexpectcd that the Austriai.s had n<a
ir.e to remove their enormous depots ci
lunitions and provisions, which they epeavored
to dartroy, but a large part ol
hich fell into Russian hands.
The latest computation of prisoners
iken during the first half of the summer
impaign gives a total of 350,000. ac>rding
to Russian officers, who estimate
tso that the total Austro-German "Tbssec,
icluding killed and wounded, are close
> SOO.OOO. On the basis of these figures
ol. Shumsky. military critic of the
ourse Gazette, argues that the Austroerman
losses since the beginning of the
ar have been fully half the total of
leir available forces.
