F]ames Light Bay;
Big Damage Here
Manhattan Island and surrounding territory trembled early
this morning from the force of two terrific blasts. Windows were
shattered and buildings shook on their foundations.
Varying reports indicated that at least two explosions in
widely separated quarters were responsible for the blast, which left
the air a haze of dust and smoke in the air.
Brooklyn Police Headquarters at first reported a subway ex?
plosion had occurred at Washington Street and Myrtle Avenue.
This proved untrue.
Bright flashes in the western sky told of another explosion in
nearby New Jersey. Sixty shrapnel loaded car? were reported in
flames at Black Tom, N. J-, a few minutes later.
Later reports said that the village had en destroyed and
possibly 200 persons killed.
Many persons were said to have geen killed gy the explosions
of shrapnel, which wrecked car after car.
At 3 o'ciock a group of physicians had been called together
by frantic pleas for aid from Black Tom. They were taken to the
Battery, where they boarded a goat and were hurried to the scene
of the explosion.
The sky about the Battery and over Jersey City was painted
a bright red as the two Piares burst forth. A haze of dst and smoke
hung over the city, while small pieces of debris showered pedes
trians.
Still another report, which seemed to be verified by police
reports, was that the great Eagle oil plant, located on a peninsula
extending from Communipaw, N. J., into New York Harbor, had
exploded.
The explosion shok great skyscrapers as though they were
sheds. Clouds of dust, which seemed like dense black smoke,
spurted from doorways as great sheets of glass came tumbling from
the skies.
Late workers rushed from their offices to the street to be met
by a counter rush of persons on the sidewalk seeking shelter in the
buildings.

London, .luly 29. The (l-rmam,
thrown bark witli tr*mcndnus losses
last night in two counter attacks on !
ihe Delville Wood aml one at Verman
duvillers, while the Hritish ga ned
ground at Delville, Hiph Woods and'
Posieres, bare bren unable to resaa_e|
the offensive on the Somme front. ;
Sharp hand-to-hand fighting has con- (
tinued at many places, aml the artil- i
lery pounding has been tremendous,
but General Haig reports to-night that
"nothin/ of importance" has orcurreu ;
All the news goes to rhow that the I
British are easily maintaining their
r*uperionty in the hand-to-hand fight-j
Inf, which ia gradually driving thei
Germans from the last of the r-.gh
ground that remains between Albert
ar.d Baseuase. The Cirnun losses for
the last week are uno'T.cia'ly reported!
as stupendous. In both Pozieres and
Longueval it has been literally a cn.?e
of e.ery house being a fertress, and it j
is no exaggeration to say that the gar- |
risons of these fortres?es have been
exterminated.
British Broadening Wedge.
I'nder the terrific artillery fire the \
British are now steadily wearing
through the enemy's third line. Their
wedge, tirst driven ia at PoslsrSS, ls
iridening daily. Kvery day their grow-;
ing superiority in men, guns and sup- '
plies facilitates tbeir ability to attack
where and when they please, while the
(Ierman counter attacks are petering '
out, and their much boasted counter
offensive has failed to make a ssrioas ;
impression. Their thinning lines may
almost be said to be waiting for the (
tinal push which (,eneral Haig will ,
give when he has consolidaled his new
? ons and broupht up his guns.
The importance with which the Or
maas regard the Delville Wood is
ihown by their desperate and per-j
liateat eeOBter attacks there ever since
it was won by the British. Similar
counter attacks agaiast Pozieres
showed their consternation at losing
it, and were kept up till the territic
losses made it impossible to jret the
troops to go forward again. Ap?
parently the same thing has now hap?
pened ifl regard to the Delville Wood
Lose (.round After Attacks.
The fact that each of these counter
attacks is foilowe.l by a gain for the
Hritish shows how great their superi?
ority over the Germans has become.
W;thout spectacular charges, without
anv general attack along the front, the
Britiah, with greaade am! knife and
bavonet. are slowly and surely eutting

ridge, and forcing their way ao ?

Justice Guy Grants
Prisoner Time to
Seek New Trial.
ORDER COMES AS
HE WAITS TO DIE
Court Will Pass On New
Evidence and Retrial
Plea August 23.
While Charles F. Stielow, his wife,
daughter and little son were praying
in the death house in Sing Sing last
evening that something might inter
vene to save him from death in the
tleetric chair at 11 o'clock. Prir.cipal
Keeper Freuerirk K Dorner came run-!
ning into the chamber.
"I've g"od news, Charley'" he ex
claimed. "Judge Guy has given you
thr.e weeks more in which to get a
i ew trial."
The prisoner, stunned, looked at him
inquiringly.
"You get another chance for a *iew
trial," thc official repeated.
"Thank God!" responded Stielow.
"This is a great thing for ma and my
family." _ j
Then, while the death house rang with
the cheers aml congratulations of the
score of others awaiting their hour to
die, Stielow broke down and wept for
the first time since he was arrssted,
eharged with the murder of Charles F.
Phelps, a wealthy farmer of Medina,
and Margaret Woleott, Fhelps's house- '
keeper.
Prisoner's Fifth Repriere.
It was Stielow's fifth reprieve from
death. In the morning he was don
nmg his death clothes and had but
forty minutes to live when the princi?
pal keeper notified him that, at the re
quest of Justice Guy, he had postponed
exerution until 11 o'clock last night
Two weeks before, when but two hours !
seemingly remained for him to live, a
?imllai notice from Jastlee Co_S. of'
Buffalo, postponed execution twenty
fear hours for Governor Whitman to
act.
New Evidence Is Found.
The order of Justice Guy, issned
four hours before Stielow was to have
gone to the chair, directs the District
Attorney of OriSSBS County to appear
in the Supreme Court of the adjoining
County of Monroe August tt to show
cause whv a motion for a new trial
should not be granted on the ground
of ncwly discovered evidence and or?
ders Thomas Mott Osborne, warden of
Sing Sing. to postpone Stielow's execu
tiofl pending the determination of the
motion.
The ground? for the order are arn
davits tetting forth that at the time of
his trial Stielow's mental condition was
such he could not inform his counsel
of the cin umstano- BBder which hia
alleged confession was obtained; that
the private detective who got. the con?
fession has since ailmitted it was ot>
taineil by duress and under promises ef
immunitv, and that evidence has been
discovered that on the night Phelps
and his housekeeper were murdered a
pedler, who has sir.ee disappeared,
stayed in the hon -
playing largef sums ef money than he
had hitheite been known to possess.

Motormen and conductors of the Third Avenue Railway
Company adopted resolutions last nipht calling for a general

The news flashed up and down Third Avenue, where gangs of
rioters marched and countermarched, stoning streetcars and
piling up barricades of paving blocks across the tracks.
Wiliiam B. Fitzgerald. a member of the executive board oi
the carmen's union, declared that the vote the employes took
last night would tie up every line operated by the Third Avenue
system within twenty-four hours. The greater part of the sur?
face lines in Manhattan would be paralyzed, he said.
"We have no present intention of calling a strike among
the elevated and subway employes," said Fitzgerald. "We are
organizing them and bringing them into the union. After the
organization is completed the men will present their demands
to the Interborough and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit. If these
demands are refused a strike is probable."
BRITAIN RUSHES
FRYATT INQUIRY
Mighty Protest Is Likely,
but There Is No Thought
of Retaliation.
Bv ARTHl'R S. DRAPER.
London, Juiy 29. The British govern?
ment in await.r.g Ambassador Gerard's
report of thc trial and is now also con- j
sidering what course of action to take ?
regarding the cxecution of Captain ,
Fryatt, of the steamship Brussels.
While no decision has as yet been
reached as to what action will be taken,
it probably will assume the form of a
weighty protest to all neutral powers.
It is most unlikely that Britain will
trouble to think about retaliation.
The government's attitude will be de
termincd on the ground of the great
principle involved, namely, that the
prsssnt crime means that no merehant '
ship may henceforth defend itself when
attacked by an armed vessel. The Ger
man ii.terpretation of international law
is that a submarine may sink an un
arm.-d vessel without warnir.g, but that
a pea.*eful merchantman may not even
Stttn.pt to prevent such an attack. As
a high Admiralty official stated to The
Tribune to-day:
"Thus new interpretation atTects neu?
trals a~ srsll as bsUigsrsBts, There?
fore, any i.cutral commander attempt
ing to avoid a submarine is likely to
render himself hable to (aptain
Fryatt's fate. The I'nited States naval

is the grav.' ground for suspicion that
