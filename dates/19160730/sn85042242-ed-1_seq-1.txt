GERMANY OCCUPIES
ENEMY'S TERRITORY
Allies Celebrate Closing of Sec­
ond Epoch by Smashing
Drive
The second year of the world
"War closes with the "Buttle of
Europe," a concerted effort of the Al­
lies on three fronts to crush the
Central Powers, which has developed
into a titanic struggle, before which
superlatives, already exhausted, are
completely beggared.
No definite figures can be given of
the cost of the great war in blood
and pold but the most reliable esti­
mates present figures so vast that
they .become practically meaningless.
In March, 1916, the United States
General Army Staff estimated that
the total losses in men to all the bel­
ligerents since the war began were
13,033,000. Of this number Prance
was debited with 800,000 dead, Ger­
many 580,000 dead, Russia 1,000,000
dead. On June a British government
estimate of German casualties, stated
to have been compiled from official
German causalt lists gave the total
of 3,012,637. As all the belligerents
have ceased issuing casualty lists for
public consumption the exact figures
for any country are unavailable.
Coat Figures Reliable
As to the money question figures
are more reliable but still vague. They
present sums which are so beyond
anything previously known to inter­
national finances, so impossible of any
human comparison that they become
little more than a jumble ofe figures.
In-March Dr.-Karl HeJfejtich,. Secre­
tary of.- the Imperial' Treasury of
Germany, estimated that, the i«far
costing all the combatants $875,000,
000 a week or eleven and a half bil­
lion dollars a year. Wiliam Michael
Is, ahother German financial expert,
put the yearly cost at the vaster sum
of "fifteen billions and other finan­
cial authorities gave higher figures.
PEACE RUMORS
On July 17 Reginald McKenna,
British Chancellor of the Exchequer,
stated in the House of Commons that
the expenditures for Great Britain
alone were $80,000,000 daily. He did
not say, however, how much of this
incredible sum represented war ex­
pense.
Within' the last few months there
has been some talk of peace in Ger­
many and considerable peace activity
bv unofficial bodies in Various coun­
tries, 'but there has been little indi­
cation that the chancelleries of Eur­
ope are at present seriously consider­
ing a close of hostilities.
Prance and Great Britain in the
west, Russia in the east, Italy in the
south are hurling waves of armed men
on the Teutonic lines, together with
•n avalanche of shells and bombs
such as the world has not known up
to the present time. For the first
time the Teutons are, temporarily at
least, on the defensive on the thous­
ands of miles of the existing battle
fronts
The change in the situation which
the year has brought is striking, al­
though the results so far have been
more pbtentjal atafl spectacular than
radcal. A year ago the Germans,
continuing their great drive against
the Russians, hurled the Slaves back
along the entire eastern front, captur­
ed Warsaw, the great fortresses of
Kovno, Novo Georgievsk and Erest
Litovsk and established lines far in­
side Russia territory which they main­
tained virtually unbroken until with­
in the last three months. Thev seiz­
ed all. Poland, a great slice of Russia
to the south of that country and ex­
pelled the invaders from Galicia and
Bukowina. Field Marshals von flin
denburg and von Mackensen were die
heroes of these great successes.
Changes Small
On the western front the changes
In position during the year were com­
paratively small but the twelve
months were marked by three events
of Interest: The battles of Cham­
pagne and Verdun and the opening
of the great Franco-British offense
on the Somme took place in this
period.
The battle of Champagne opened
on'September 25, after a week's ter­
rific bombardment of the German
lines by the French, British and Bel­
gians. In. a week of the bloodiest
fighting that had 'been known up to
that time'the Allies announced that
they had taken twentv miles of
trenches, six towns of 23,000 prison­
ers. Bnt there they halted. They
could not break through the mlghtv
German wall and the grim deadlock
which marked the western front for
many months was resumed. The
Efettle of Champagne marked the re­
moval of Sir John French, the Brit­
ish Commander-in-Chief from the be­
ginning of the war up to that time,
in December, 1S15, it was announced
that he had resigned to take" a home

Washington, July 29.—'Special pro­

marine, Deutschland, when she starts
out of American territoial waters,
was asked of the American govern­

that the boat would leave Baltimore
sometime tomorrow. After confer­
ences between state, treasury and
navy department officials, it was ruled
that no extraordinary precautions
would be ordered, because the United

BARD WRITES POEM
EXTOLLING MAJ. HENRY
Capt. Solum Expresses Thanks

Troops
By STAFF CORRESPONDENT.
Llano G-rande, Texas, July 29.—
For a townsite that waB almost de­
serted, save for a sign or two, three
weeks ago, Llano Grande is coming
along at an astounding rate.
It now has a ibathtub, with good
prospects of a second one, a barber
shop, a laundry, two movies, a hun­
dred or so motor trucks, and as many
automobiles, to say nothing of 12,000
citizens.
The bathtub is a porcelain one, at
that, and belongs to a civilian who
operates a pop stand, and who has
learned that soldiers consume large
quantities of cold drinks, particular­
ly when there is no water in camp.
The cloud of soldiers which descend­
ed upon Hidalgo county at this point
iwas silver lined for him, literally.
Plenty of Air.
If Llano Grande had a movie cen­
sor, or Ibuilding inspector, he would
have no kick on ventilation. They
are the best ventilated movies south
of the Mason and Dixon line, and
probably north, east and west of it,
for that matter.
In order to build a movie here, you
erect a high board fence, shaped,
with the opening of the toward the
street. Then you build a smaller
fence, shaped, with the point of
the projecting from the mouth of
the U. '. ..
TOU t»ffioeiathttapB4
fecatter "Some benches around the
ground within th£ and your palace
of amusement is complete.
No Rain Checks.
The man who built the first movie
house was in hard luck. It rained
twice in fourteen months here, and
once was the other night, iwhen Mr.
Movie Man had his grand opening.
Bain checks were needed badly.
Now they are showing pictures of
militiamen entraining for the Mexican
border, at double Duluth prices, with
great success.
Q. M. S. Edward S. Peterson of Co.
is something of a regimental bard
and he felt so fine on the trip south
that he penned the following lines.

We're on the way to Mexico,

From Henry—Major Henry.

For the first time scientific aid to

This is the first year that systemat­

men are required in certain communi­
ties and find out where no men are
needed. This will prevent overflood
ing of communities with help when it
is already supplied. iMany men now
go a long distance, only to find that
reports of work at their destination
were false. This not only makes un­
due expense and a waste of time, but
often puts the man making the trip
in an unkind mood.
Labor Agents to Co-operate.
Arrangements have been made to
co-operate with the labor agents in
the states further south, so that when
the harvest is completed there the
men may be directed here.
Mr. Flint already has a partial list
of places where men are wanted and
has 'been in correspondence with com­
mercial and farmers' clubs.

Washington, July 29.—Mooted ques­
tions about the statu? of state troops
called into the Inderal service for the
Mexican emergency are decided in an
exhaustive opinion given Secretary
Baker today by 'Brigadier General
Crowder, Judge advocate general of
the army. General Crowder holds that
the state soldiers are not subject to
duty outside of the United States and
until they are formally drafted by or­
der of the president that they aie
under control of the federal govern­
ment and not of their respective state
governors, and that they are entitled
to the same pension and privileges as
regulars.
While congress by joint resolution
has conferred upon the president au­
thority to draft the militia and na­
tional guard, In his discretion, the
general points out that the president
has not exercised that authority. In
the meantiide, he says, the status of
the state troops "is that of militia
called into the service of the Unit­
ed States for one of the purposes spe­
cified in the constitution, that is, to
protect the United States from inva­
sion."
