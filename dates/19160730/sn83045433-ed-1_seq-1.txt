ROUTE PLANNED
Germany Preparing Trans
Atlantic Service with Huge
Planes, Says Report.
tBy the Internatteal News %erviee.)
New York. July 29.-German enterprise,
having startled the world by sending to
the United States a merchant subma
rine boat, is said by reliable authority
to be preparing further to excite admira
tion hy linking the two countries through
a trans-Atiantlie air service.
It $a definitely known that German aero
nautic genius has perfected a huge triple
screw triplane, which is of sumieent
power and endurance to cross the Atlan
tic. Tests of this aircraft have proved
Its possibilities, and, it In declared, the
exact date of the flying blockade-run
ners' arrival depends only upon pro
pitious atmospheric conditions.
The giant air vessel will carry several
tons of mail. a crew of eighteen or twenty
men, and gasoline sufficient for a 7.n
mile journey. The machine, the Interna
tional News Service informant states, will
he sent on its way from its base at
Helgoland. Its run to America will be
about thirty hours.
Official announcement of the promised
spectacular achievement, it is stated, has
been delayed in hope the Bremen, the
second merchant submarine, would bring
more complete Information and perhaps
some photographs.
The superstructure. according to the
description given, consists of three su
perposed planes, each having a span of
15) feet.
A pontoon is attached to the tip of
each lower plane.
Two hydroplanes. pncumatic life pre
eervers and fire extinguishers will be
conveniently carried for use in case of

car, leaped after and captured the man,
who gave his name as Joseph Burns, a
professional strikebreaker. He is held on
a charge of homicide.
Thousands of persons were gathered
along the street where the accident oc
curred, and Burns was saved from harm

Hardwick Seeks to Saddle Im
migration Bill on Wilson's a
ri
Pet Project.
By ANDREW R. KELLE, a
pi
Trouble for the administration legisla
tive program loomed large and strong
yesterday wiii the Senate wrangled over
the plan, proPosed by Senator Hardwick,
of attaching the ininigiation bill to the
child-labor bil as a rider.
The Georgia Senator. a bitter opponent S
of the child-labor law, will have the sup
port of Republican Senators in his ef- L
forts to have the immiigration bill added I
to the other measure. I
The inimigialion hill, standing alone, t
would be vetoed by President Wilson. if c(
it is attached to the child-labor inas
ure, the Chief Executive must automat- il
ically aiapprove thit law. d
Senator Poindexter precipitated the de
bate when lie announced his intention of
forcing a vote on the immigration bill!L
at the present session rather than in De
cember, as was plainned by the Demo
eratic majorit. io
Senator Iteeo. of Missouri, denounced d
as infamous and shameful the plan to
tie up the child-labor bill with other leg
islation. "I ami not authorized to speak a
for the President, but I feel safe in pre
suming that the immigration measure I
will meet a veto." he said, "and the Sen
ator from Georgia has a deep-seated pyr- tI
pose inl taking this action.''
Senator Hardwi'k replied that lie would
do anything in the world that was hon
orable to defeat the child-labor legisla- S
tion. He expressed regret that the Presi
dent haed seen it to comiie to the Senate s
and urge action on the measure.
The country ir ring for a restricted a
immrigration law , saiording to Senator y
Hardwick, and It was thie duty of the p
Congress to pass ii at once, regaidless a
of the President's iews on the measure. It
'Wise nmen have changed their minds
and mayhaps PresIdent Wilson may
change his In this mratter. We have no b
right to assume that because he vetoed
this bill once before he will veto It
again," said Senator Htardwick.
