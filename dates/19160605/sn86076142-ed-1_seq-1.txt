(By Asaoclated Press.)
(ilK'AdO, June ". The movement for the nominal ion took on
tilt aspects of a genuine boom today. Delegations brought evidence
of a sentiment in favor of the jurist, and men, who have been identi
fied with the "Old tiunrd," declared that many delegates instructed
for others were ready to turn their votes to him after the first ballot.
Lack of a controlling leadership by the men who have composed
the "Old Guard" is emphasized. They expressed themselves favoring
Hughes because arriving delegates believe be can be a harnionizer and
bring in the Progressive strength.
Explanations are sough of the failure for the sentiment in favor
of Koosevelt to crystallize.
The Progressive national committee declared today it will with
hold the nomination of a candidate until Saturday aw aiting the action

Naval Guns Used Ashore
Because They Carry
Farther Than Siege Guns
(By Associated Press.)
PARIS, June 5. The use of naval guns ashore in the present war,
it is pointed out by a naval expert, is not a mere expedient, resulting
from accidental or incidental circumstances, but as a well defined rea
son in the greater-initial speed of the projectile of a naval gun and
the consequently longer range than that of field artillery. - The new
services they render are due to the aeroplane, which gives the gun
ner on land longer ranges of fire than he used to get.
The 15-inch naval guns with which the Germans occasionally
bombard Dunkirk and Nancy are believed to be from ships lying idle
in the Kiel Canal. They are utilized because they carry farther than
the big mortars.
The type of the naval guns would have been more commonly used
on land for field work had it not been so much heavier and more diffi
cult to manipulate than the shorter ranger field and siege guns. Seven
inch to eight inch naval pieces may be mounted on railroad trucks,
but the recoil of the larger calibres is so violent as to require a solid
eonerete foundation. ,,. ' - ' "

Twenty six of Admiral Jellicoe's most powerful battleships ware
