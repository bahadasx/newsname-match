Progressives Plan to Defer
Nomination Until Colonel
0 K?s G. 0. P. Nominee.
I u te'riia t i na I New s Servo1 :
CHICAGO, June The progres
sives all along the convention row
today were devoting most of their
tune to sounding the new Jtoosevelt
slogan "Heal the wound to the
Lone."
The Poosevelt republican commit
tee, of which George von L. Meyer,
former secretary of the navy, is
chairman, launched the new slogan
in a large advertisement printed in
the local papers today. It was at
once taken up by the . progre ssives,
who are fighting the hardest to have
the republicans nominate Poosevelt.
The advertisement, printed over vchi
Meyers' name, in part says:
"A great crisis in our country's
affairs is at hand.
"As goes the next four years at
Washington so goes the ne-xl 40 years
v ith our nation.
"Fioad patriotism and sterling
Americanism are the watchwords."
Ilrt's Progress! Plan.
All progressive leaders today were
m rioiisly considering the latest plan
propesed to be follower! by th pro
gressive convention. This plan is
that the name of Col. Poosevelt be
placed in nomination as quickly as
the convention is opened. No vote
v. ould be taken. The convention
would mark time until word was re ceived
as to what action would be
taken by the republican conventieiii.
If the republicans lmmin.ited the
colonel the progressives would then
rush the vote on Poosevelt in their
convention and ratify the action of
the edder party.
A great eleal of diftVrence lias
.".risen, however, over the course to
be fedlovveel m the event that the
republicans choose Hughes. The ma
jority of the progressives aitd that
r. known to include P. A. Van Wil
kenburg ef Philadelphia; Harold I
I ke-s. Illinois leader, and William
Flinn of Pittsburgh believe that the
progressives should take no action
until Justice Hughes has made an
acceptance statement. They would
have Ced. Poosevelt pass on that
statement himself. If the former
president decided that Huehes show -
1 by his state ment that he was a
strong enough adveeate of real pre
paredness, then the colonel's name
would be withdrawn and Hughe s pat
up and etuick1v nominated by the

WASHINGTON. June Koose
velt followers in the progressive
camp have failed in their efforts to
force Justice Charles F. Hughes to
declare himself on the "I loo.' evelt
policies." Justice Huu'hes will make
no comment conaerninc the republi
can national convention or the boom
for his nomination for the presi
dency. His final word was said
when he authorized a statement last
week that no man was representing
him at Chicago in connection with
the nomination. This was stated to
day by Lawrence H. Green. Justice
Hughes private secretary.
"There will be no further com
ment of any kind, authorized In

Fven in the event that Justice
Hughes Is nominated by the repub

that he will make no announcement
of whether he will accept or reject
the honor until after the bull moose
takes some definite stand as to the
nominat ion.
