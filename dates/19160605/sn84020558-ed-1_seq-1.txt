there are no contested seats in the con

planned by the committee.
Leaders thought it possible, however,
that some statement ought be issued
bearing on the relations of the repub
licans and progressives.

Ibioscvelt supporters today, for the
personal attendance here by Colonel :
Roosevelt, bis secretary John V. Mc
Onith, declared positively tonight thai
the colonel would remain at Oyster Bay !
during the convention.
Two progressive national committee-
men, Harold I., lckes, of Illinois, and
William Holton Dye of Indiana, tonight I

'Certainly the progressives will not;
nominate Justice Hushes without !

Mutual interest of progressives and I

sp dilation as to what the old guard

Fairbanks, Weeks or Barton, or
Whether they would attempt to con
ciliate the progressives by choosing
a njun whom the latter might sup
port. The name of Justice Hughes
is the only one that has been brought
forward so far as having such pos
sibilities. Among the rank and Tile of the
republicans there are indications of
a genuine effort to drau the pro
gressive:! back into the old partv.

Most of. the delegates who came in
today were of the element that stood

a positive position against his can

nomination is impossible, they agree
that the influence of his supporters I

I uWDON, June t, A statement is

I confirming previous accounts of the
(battle between the British and Ger

accounts of the German losses arc
false, and that although the evidence
is still incomplete, enough is known
to Justify stating that the German
losses were greater than the British,
not merely relatively to the strength
of tbe two fleets, hut absolutely."
Thore is the strongest ground for
believing, the statement says, that the
German losses include two battier.
ships, two dreadnaught battle cruis
ers of the most powerful type and
two of the latest light cruisers, in ad
