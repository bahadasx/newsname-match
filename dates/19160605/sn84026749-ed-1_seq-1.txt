DEATH TOLL
IN BIG NAVAL
BATTLE GROWS
Hope of English That More
Survivors of Great Sea Fight
Would Be Found Crushed.
TALES OF HORROR POUR IN
London Admiralty Continues In
sistence That Germans Lost
, More Than They Admit.
LONDON, June 5. The hops
of many English families, mem
bers of which were on tho ships
lost in the great Skagerak sea
fight, that some of the men would
be rescued, is being slowly crush
ed by the tales of the awfulness
brought in by vessels which havo
reached Copenhagen since the bat
tle. But with the crushing of this
hope, pride in the navy is growing
hourly with continued insistence of
the British admiralty that the Ger
mans lost far more heavily than
they admit.
"There seems to be the strong
est ground for supposing that in
cluded in the German battle losses
are two battleships, two dread
naught battle cruisers of the most
powerful type, two of the latest
light cruisers, the Wiesbaden arid
the Elbiflg; a light pruiser of the
'Rostock type, the light cruiser
Frauenlob, nine destroyers, and a
submarine,' the statement said.
32,515-TON LOSS.
The admitted German loss In tonnage
U now 32.515 tons. The British claim
an additional 80,920 tons, which would
brine the German total to 113,435. The
British admit the loss of 114.100 tons.
The 80,000 tons which the Germans
do not admit la made up, say the Brit
ish, of battleshlDS Wostfaten. the battle
cruiser Derffllnger, the battle cruiser
XAitzow, a light cruiser, three additional
destroyers, a no! one submarine.
(The Germans admit only the losa of
the battleship Pommern, the cruisers
Wiesbaden. Frauenldb, and Elblng, and
ix destroyers.)
Bodies Wash Ashore.
Dispatches received In London from
Copenhagen say many of the bodies of
the British and German sailors lost In
Um sea flccht have been washed up
alone the Jutland shore. Several of the
tailors of the Wiesbaden were rescued
by Scandinavian steamers, which also
picked up torpedo boat survivors, both
British and German. The - survivors,
however, were very few.
All of the sailors of the vessels that
have passed through the battle In the
waters since the battle agree that In
nearly every instance the loss of life
with the destruction of the ships must
have been nearly total, ships arriving In
Copenhagen report.
Hundreds.of the seamen Jumped to
rafts and were slowly driven Insane
by the torture of thirst, Some drank
salt water, and, going stark-crazy,
J ought with weakened companions,
Umped Into tho sea, and were
Irowned.
. Cruisers Withdrawn.
The dispatches also state that many
large German cruisers, which here
tofore have been patrolling the Cour
land coast (Russia), have been with
drawn. Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty Is
today looked upon as one of Great
Britain's illustrious naval heroes.
With the men of the fleet he Is an
Idol.
They all agree that when the Ger
man battle losses become fully known
It will be shown that the action was
a glorious victory for the British
navy.
The admiralty report that the War
spite was not sunk, as claimed by the
Germans, Is confirmed by seacoast re
ports saying that she limped Into
port under her own steam late Thurs
day, the day after the battle.
Sailors said the battle was fought
In a sea calm as a mlllpond, with a
mist hanging low, making firing at
the longer ranges almost Impossible.
"It sounded like forty thunder
tnrma rolled Into one." was the de
scription of one. Most briefed It by
saying It was "hell."
Liquid Fire Fails
On Verdun Forts
French Hurl Back Fierce Night
Attacks in Hand-to-hand
Fighting.
PARIS, June 5. Tho Germans
launched several hot Infantrv attacks
against Fort Vaux last nlRht. employing
liquid lire, but despite this the attacks
were repulsed, says the French official
communique today.
Elsewhere along the line cast of the
i Mcuso the fighting was heavy, but
tho Germans wore unable to gain a yard,
the statement says.
At Damloup tind Fort Vanx the
charges of tho Goiman Infantry nded
In hand-to-hnnd struggles along the
trench lines. The Germani did not ob
tain a foothald nt anv placo. The
heaviest part of the attack was di
rected against Vaux.
PROGRESSIVES
BUT
TO DELAY VOTE IN
By Pooling They Might Stop
Nomination of Hughes or T.
R., Politicians Say.
CONVENTION EVE LINE-UP
Hughes Will Get Largest Vote on
First Ballot, According to
Mathematicians.
By JUDSON C. WELLTVER,
CHICAGO, June 6. Here is the mathe
matical situation out of which this con
vention must pick a Presidential nom
inee: There will be 985 delegates voting In
the convontton.
Necessary to nominate. 451.
Now comes the first ballot strength
of various candidates. Tou can get all
kinds of guesses, hut It Isn't safe to
accept without question the claims of
any candidate, because to do that and
then add them all together will give a
total about twice as big as the num
ber of delegates. So there la appended
the tabulation furnished by the man
ager of one of the candidates, after a
careful canvass. It is perhaps as good
as any other:
Weeks. 120: Burton, 80: Root, 7Sj Fair
banks, 100: Cummins, 100; Ford, 30;
Borah. 18: Brumbaugh, 25; du Pont, 6;
La Follette. 30. Total, 564.
T. R. Votes" Uncertain.
The remainder, 421, may 'bo divided
between Roosevelt and Hughes. It la
hard to get a figure on the votes "for
Roosevelt on the first ballot. Frank
Hitchcock, while docltntng to tell the
sources of the Hughes strength, de
clares the Justice will havo from 300 to
350 dn flrtt ballot.
That Is manifestly on tho basis of an
cxpanslveness which, If projected to the
other candidates' claims, would make
the convention too big to sit In the Coli
seum. More probably, Justice Hughes
will have about 200 votes on first ballot,
and will show a sharp Increase on the
second or third.
Now comes tho question of strategy
among the "allies.'1 or the associated
favorite sons, or whatever they may be
called. If they could pool their issues
and hold all their strength for several
ballots, the nomination might be de
ferred a considerable time. The danger,
of course, to such a combination Is that

CALL FOR COLONEL

Gardner and Other Followers
Want Him There, While Still
Others Object.
CHICAGO, June 5. There Is a strong
demand, countered also by strong op
position, that Colonel Roosevelt shall

In the Progressive camp the question
has been debated with vehemence In
the last twenty-four hours.
As a rule the demand for Colonel

irreconcuanies wno want no composi

nomination of Roosvelt himself.
Thoy believe the situation In this town
Is such that if Roosevolt would come
there would be a tremendous demon
stration for him, not only In Chicago,
but all along the road, that would deep
ly impress the country and the dele
gates. Delegations Now Hostile.
Especially Is It urged that there Is
need to bring Roosevelt, because tho
delegations that have come from States
that used to be regarded as distinctive

hands hostile to htm.
Tho favorite son delegations havo been
selected so far as possible with a view
to keeping them hitched as ngalnst any
Roosevelt Influence or the possibility of
an attempt at stantpode.
It hnn been InMsted that the presence
of tho Colonel, In the electrical atmo
sphere 'of this town, would provide an
offset to this situation. On tho other
hand, thore uro a good many most de

performances of his life, and not bene

Gardner Wants Him.
Congressman Gardner of Massachu

fighting for the
Roosevelt causo, has been demanding
that tho Colonel get on a fast train and

delay. It has not been definitely defined

Ultimatums Fly From
One Camp to Another
(Prom n Staff Correspondent.)
CHICAGO, June b.Ug shells in the
form of ultimatums from one camp
and the other began to fly over Chi
cago today.
The unprecedented political battle,
which will reach Its height later In the
week, began to grow constantly more
Intense and exciting.
After numerous conferences last
evening, the Old Guard leaders, through
Senator Penrose, have advised the Hull.
Moose leaders what they demand. It Is
the withdrawal of Roosevelt and elim
ination or Hughes, wltn the under
standing that Roosevelt and the Old
Guard then unite on one of the favorite
sone or a dark horse.
If Roosevelt declines, as he Is ex
pected to, thon the Old Guard say they
will go ahead and nominate Hughes.
Progressive party leaders have given
It out that they will not take Hughes
unless he comes out Into the open ana
makes a statement defining his views
on Americanism ana preparedness.
Uoth the propositions aro labeled as
ultimate.
Hut In many quarters there Is a dis
position to think thcra Is a certain
amount of blurting lu both camps.
Hughes and Roosevelt are the two tlg
ures of commanding Importance today,
Just as they have been throughout tho
convention preliminaries.
Claims Overstated?
Roosevelt loaders this morning (began
putting out statements to show that the
Hughes strength has been overstated
In a number of delegations. Thoy laid
especial stress on Maine, which the
Hughes men have been claiming. Tho
Roosevelt men said, as a matter of
fact, four of the twelve Malpo dele
gates would bo for Roosevelt on tlrst
ballot, a (If tli probably and ultimately
seven would be for Rooseovlt.

One of the numerous harmonv move

Havs Hammond. Like many another
1912 belllgorent, he Is now trying to
pour oil on the waters. Ho has made
arrangements to give a dinner at the
Chicago Club to Old Guard leaders and
Progressive party leaders. After racking
his brain as to how he would divide them
up numerically, he concluded to appor
tion them on the basis of the 1912 vote.
Hughes' Prospects Strong.
Prospects for the nomination of
Hughes are generally regarded as
strong. In the swarming corridors of
the packed hotels, Hughes talk Is up
permost. Governor Whitman. Herbert Parsons,

HUGHES' SELECTION
INEVITABLE,! SAYS
GERMANY PUTS
BAN ON MEAT
FOR 8 WEEKS
Civilians Must Forego Flesh
Until Cattle Are Fattened,
Says Food Dictator.
"FAMINE" MAY LAST LONGER
Herr Batocki Declares, How
ever, Regulation Should
Cause No Elation by Foes.
The following exclusive inter
view vftth Herr von Datockl, Ger
many's new food dictator, obtained
by a United Press correspondent
at Derlln, Is believed to be the first
Interview granted by Datockl since
he was appointed to office. It la
remarkably frank discussion of
Germany's food problems.
It Is worthy of note that It was
delayed several days In transmis
sion, evidently having been held
up by the German censor and giv
en careful consideration befora
being passed.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN (Via wireless to Say
ville, L. I.), May 27 (Delayed).
Civilians in Germany must eat no
meat for the next eight weeks,
Herr Adolph von Batocki, Ger
many's new food "dictator," now
holding one of the most important
posts in the empire, told the United
Press today in a frank discussion
of the food situation as he found
it on assuming office last week.
This regulation, the new food
mnister aid, should c&use no
Hiarm in uermany ana no 'eiauon
in the camps of Germany's
enemies.
"If the coming harvest is only
medium," he said, "the starvation
of Germany through the British
blockade is out of question."
SIEGE JUST BEGUN.
The "siege" or Germany. Herr von
Batocki isaid, has just begun. The
coming eight weeks may cause some
discomfort to those Germans who are
fond of meat. Furthermore, tho meat
shortage is apt to continue for at least
three months, he declared frankly.
'"Ihe cattle aro lean now because of
a poor harvest in 15," he said. "They
cannot be slaughtered now. Wo must
wait until they ore fattened on paBtur
age. But meanwhile we have enough
meat for our military hospitals ana
places where It Is urgently needed.
"At all events, there Is enough food
In Germany, but It Is necessary civilians)
cat no meat for the next eight weeks.
Starvation Is out of question, but we
must consider not only the present food
situation, but the situation the coming
winter. In tho winter we need more
meat and more fats than In lumraer.
In order to Insure a supply for the
winter we must eat meat sparingly dur
ing the summer. Probablv meat cards
will be Issued throughout (Armany,
and there will be a few meatless weeks.
"The cause of the present shortage is
the bad harvest "ist year. lr the
harvest this year It even medium, the
food situation will begin to Improve tne
middle of July or the tlrst of August."
Must Prevent Starvation.
Herr von Hatockl's Job Is to take the
strangle hold out of the British block-
ade. He must prevent the starvation
of Germany by her enemies. He must
provide equitable distribution or the na
tion's food supplies. Ho has done
much already, and by keeping the pub
lic well Informed regarding tho food
situation and obtaining public co-operation,
he expects to do much more.
To understand his task, an Amorlcan
must Imagine the United StHto block
aded, no corn to fatten the cattle, and
each person provided with half n pound
of meat, a fifth of a pound of butter,
war bread, and plenty of vegetables
each week. "He must Imagine, too. that
the United States Is at war, with all
her able-bodied men fighting, and ?.000.
000 prisoners, the population of Polnnd,
besides C5.000.000 Americans to feed.
Then he must Imagine the Job confront
ing a national food department with
nuthorlty to regulate what one buys and
eats.
Next Saturday representatlven of the
larjer Oermnn cities vi 111 romo to Ber
lin for a conference nt which arrange
ments will bo made for the cstablUh
mnt of food depots, where cooked
food will be sold at cost. This scheme
haB been tried already in some places
with good results.
