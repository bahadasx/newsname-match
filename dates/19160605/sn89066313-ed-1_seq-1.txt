Prof. J. D. Elliff, Director,
Points to High Percentage
of Professors Here.
CLASSES ARE SMALL
Number of Courses Will Be
Increased Many Teachers
From Out of State.
"Tin' faculty of the 111 Hi Summer
Session l the I'nivcrslty of Missouri,"
says Prof J. 1. KIlilT. director or the
Summer Session, "is beyond a doubt
the strongest in scholarship, training
and ability, anions the universities in
the Middle West, if mot in the entire
country. In percentage to the number
of students it is the largest faculty In
the country, without exception."
Professor Klliff liases these state
ments on two facts: that titty-seven
out of the total of eighty-three mem
bers of the Summer Session facility
are of professional rank, and that,
taking the enrollment of last summer
as a base of comparison with that
of other schools, the number
of tuachers to the individual stu-v
dent is not onily greater but the i laps
es are much smaller.
Jbivi- Are Small Here.
"The great summer schools of the
University of Chicago and Columbia
I'niversity," says Professor Klliff,
"hate two hundred or more students
in each class. The average class en
rollment here is eighteen."
The number of faculty members
coming from schools other than the
University of Missouri has grown this
year. also. Kelley U Alexander and

FIGHT IN MOTOR CAR
LEADS TOJ ARREST
Charles Haney Is Held for
Assaulting R. L. Baldwin
With a Hammer.
LATTER IS WOUNDED
Affray Follows Leap to Run
ning Board of Vehicle on
Blackfoot Gravel.
Rufus L. Ilaldwiu, taxicab driver,
lies at his home on East liroadway,
suffering from five severe scalp
wounds.
Charles Haney, GO.". North Seventh
street, a restaurant waiter, is held
under a ..-no bond, charged with the
state offense of assault with intent to
kill.
Such are the results of a quarrel
between Haney and Iialdwin on the
Illackfoot gravel near Columbia late
last Friday evening, in which, it is al
leged, Haney attacked Iialdwin with
a hammer.
The quarrel occurred in the taxi
cab driven by Iialdwin. In the car
with several other passengers was
Mrs. Haney, wife of the alleged as
saulter, from whom he has been sepa
rated for some time. According to
witnesses of the quarrel, Iialdwin was
driving his car along the road when
Haney caught up with him in another
car. The quarrel came when Haney
jumped on the running board of the
Iialdwin car and occupied the front
seat with Iialdwin. In the mix-up,
Iialdwin was beaten on the head with
a hammer that had been lying in the
bottom of the car.
The wounded man was brought to
his home in Columbia, where he was
attended by Dr. W. A. Norris. His
wounds are pronounced not serious,
although they confine the victim to
his bed.
Haney was arrested by Constable T.
F. Whitesides this morning. He
pleaded not guilty to the charge of as
sault with intent to kill, when ar
raigned before Justice John S. Iiick
nell, and was released on a $."i00 bond
for appearance at 10 o'clock Fridav
morning. Haney is represented by
Attorney E. C. Anderson, the state be
ing represented by Prosecuting At
torney W. M. Dinwiddle.

CUPID IS LOSING HIS GRIP;
JUNE'S POPULARITY WANES
Whether it is because of the high
cost of living, or the cost of high liv
ing, or some other insurmountable
barrier, the fact remains that June
weddings have been becoming fewer
in Itoone County each year for the
last three years.
A glance over the records of Re
corder J. L. Henry revealed the fact
that the number of marriage licenses
issued in June, 191."., was nine less
than the number issued in the same
month, 19i:i. In June, three years ago,
a total of twenty-six bold youths de
clared their respective resolves and
filled out the necessary affidavits. In
June, 1914, only nineteen affidavits
were filed away in the county ar
chives. The number became less by
two in 1913." From twenty-six in 1913
to seventeen in 191." surely the cost
of marriage must have increased or
the tales of love have grown old.
Whether June. 191C, will continue
to see a decrease remains to be seen.

BY THE NEW BROWNS
Count Is 9 to 0 in a Slug-
fest of 1H Hits for the
Columbians.
DIPPOLD MAKES FIVE
Slusher Clouts a Home Run
With Bases Full May
Play Tomorrow.
In the first game under the new
player-managers, Iiryant and Taylor,
the Columbia Iirowns defeated the
Iligbeo Mines, 9 to 0, in a slug-fest
before a large crowd, including many
Columbians, at Higbee yesterday aft
ernoon. The Columbia team had four
other Tigers on the line-up besides
the two managers.
Dippold, the Tiger right fielder, led
the batters by getting a hit each of the
five times that he was at bat. The
Iirowns got eighteen hits off of the
Iilues best pitchers, Neally and Ever-
ret, while the Iilues' had to be con
tent with four hits off of Iiryant.
Slusher won a place in the heart of
all the Columbia fans when he clouted
out a home run with all of the bases
full. The Higbee fans presented Hill
the new Iirown catcher, with a bou
quet, and he responded with a single
to right field. Later in the ninth
inning he injured his hand, and it is
doubtful whether he will be able to
play iu the game with the St. Louis
All-Stars here tomorrow. If the
weather is favorable, the Iirowns will
play a double header with this team.

COLUMI1US, X. M., June ."..Gener
al Pershing and his staff arrived here
this afternoon. The cause of their
visit is not known here, but it is
thought important.
cured licenses in the meager four days
already elapsed gives ample room for
hopes that the recorder's business may
see an increase.
"I can't account for the decrease
in marriages during the last three
years," said Recorder Henry when in-
vestigation showed the decrease.
("There is no other legal action a
cheap as getting married. It costs $1
to get the license, the law allows a
judge or officer in the court of rec
ord only $2 for finishing the job. When
a minister ties the knot it sometimes
costs a little more but many times
they get off cheaper."
Unusual boldness an the part of
University youths and maidens during
last few days makes the prospects
for a new record in June, 1910, pos-
jsible. University students are gone
now, however, so it remains for the
'native lads and lasses of Columbia
and Boone County to take the final
step if the alarming decrease in the
number of June weddings is to be
stopped.

CHICAGO, June r. The Hughes
boom this afternoon took a command
ing lead among the presidential booms
when the Progressive party selected a
committee to meet with a committee
from the Republican party to arrange
an agreement on the presidential can
didate. That Hughes will be the choice of
both is likely. The Republicans have
asked the Progressives to select him at
their convention Thursday. Then the
Republicans will do the same when
they nominate Saturday. The Re
publicans will accept any platform that
is agreeable to the Bull Moose men.
Former Congressman Iiartholdt of
Missouri announced that half a mil
lion Germans will cast their votes
against Wilson if Roosevelt is not the
Republican nominee. It is understood
that the Progressives want Roosevelt
first, and then Hughes. They also want
to get a statement from the justice.
Failing iu this, they will flaunt the
