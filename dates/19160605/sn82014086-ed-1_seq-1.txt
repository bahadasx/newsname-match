' British admiralty tonight issued a
i statement saying there was the
; strongest grounds for the belief that
the British t navy in the battle with
the Germans off Jutland last week had
accounted for a total of eighteen Ger
man men-of-war and that there was
nothing to add or .subtract from - the
: original announcement of the British
' losses.
The statement gave the German
I losses as two battleships, two dread
nought battle cruisers, four light crui
sers, nine torpedo boat destroyers and
a submarine.
V Pessimism in London Lessened.
The pessimism which prevailed as a
result, of the admiralty's original state
ment of losses which is now consid
ered to have been needlessly candid
ajifl conservative in under-estimating
the extent of the German losses as
compared with those of Great Britain,
has been greatly lessened by the latest
statement.
j 1 Rumors Current In Hamburg.
. A despatch from Copenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
tw;o German warships besides those
announced in tne Herman communica
tion the battleship Westfalen and the
battle cruiser 'Lutzow were sunk iil
the . battle... A wireless .despatch re
ceived here Saturday from Berlin said
the German admiralty admitted the
loss of the Westfalen. ,
: Carman Losses the Greater. -

clares that the German losses in the
flght were not only relatively, but ab
solutely greater than those of the Brit
ish. . Mfl.intainlno 1 f a nra..tirA rf mu
tton, the admiralty still refrains from
' giving the names of the lost German
ships.

No Failure in British Strategy,
Admiral Lord Beresford in an' inter
view today, while contendine stronelv
for the view that there was no failure
- in the British strategy and that Vice
Aamirai .tseatty won a brilliant sue
cess, though it was dearly bought, de
clares that the only mistake made was
. by the admiralty in allowing the Ger
mans to get first in the field with the
news of the battle or as he puts it,
with "impudent fabrications." Other
wise, said Lord Beresford, no - fault
can be found with the admiralty.
BRITISH ADMIRALTY'S
" STATEMENT OF BATTLE
Claims German Accounts of the Ger
man Losses Are False.
: London, June 4, 10.12 p. m. A jitate
snent issued tonight by the British ad
miralty, confirming" previous accounts
of the battle between the British and
German fleets reiterates that the Ger
man accounts of the German losses
are false and that although the evi
dence is still incomplete, enough is
known to Justify- stating that the Ger
man losses were greater than the 'Brit
ish, r"not merely relatively to the
strength of the, two, fleets, but abso
lutely." -- . ,
: The text of the statement follows:
"Until the commander-in-chief has
nao time to consult the. officers en
gagea and write a full despatch, any
attempt to give a detailed history of
. tne naval engagement which began on
the afternoon of the thirty-first of
May and ended in the morning hours
of the first of June, would evidently
be premature. But the results are
Quite plain.
V Leading Ships in Vigorous Fight.
The grand fleet came in touch with
the German high seas fleet at 3.30 on
the afternoon of May 31. The lead
ing ships of the two fleets carried on
a vigorous flght, in which the battle
cruisers, fast battleships and subsid
iary craft all took an active part. .
. - Losses Severe on Both Sides.
"The losses were severe on both
sides, but when the main body of the
. British fleet came into contact with
the German high seas fleet a very
: brief period sufficed to compel the la t-
ter, who had been severely punished,
to seek refuge in their protected wa
ters. The manoeuver was rendered
possible by low visibility and mist and
although the grand fleet were now and
then able to get in momentary contact
with their opponents, no continuous
action was possible.
Pursued Until Light Failed.
! "They continued the pursuit until
the light "had wholly failed, while the
British destroyers were able to make
a successful attack-upon the enemy
during the night. . ; '

British Losses Fully Stated.
The British losses have already been
ruuy stated, xnere ss nothing to add I
to or subtract from the latest account
published by" the admiralty.. The ene-
my losses are less easy to determine,
That the accounts- they have given
are false is certain, and we cannot yet
be sure of the exact truth. -But from
SUCh evidence as has-' come to OUT I
knowledge, the admiralty entertains no
doubt that the German losses are heav
ier than the British not merely rela'
tively to the strength of the two fleets.
Dut absolutely.
"There seems to be the strongest
ground for supposing that included in
the German losses are two battleships,
two dreadnought battle cruisers of the
most powerful type, two of the latest
light cruisers, the Wiesbaden and Sib
ing, a light cruiser of the Bostock
type, the light cruiwr Frauenlob, nine
destroyers and a submarine. ,

which was unexpected, was due to his
wish 'to set himself straight before
the Jews of the city and country." He
declared he had been bitterly attacked
in the Jewish press because of the
misquotation of his remarks .at ythe

ago. At that time he deprecated the
proposal that Yiddish e spoken by

today he then had declared his 'belief
that "if the Jews of Russia and the
jews of Poland would not have been

judices of ' persecution to which they

reached the stage to which all regret
it has unfortunately come.
Mr. Schiff said he had expected an
attack against him, because one had
been threatened if he did not give up
his opposition to the proposed Ameri

that he felt he deserved better at the

work he had done for them.
