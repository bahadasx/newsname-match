PARIS, June 5. 12:20 p.m?
In their repeated attacks on Fort
Yaux. one of the outlying defenses
of Verdun, along the front
east of the Meuse, the Germans 1
are hurling forward their infant'
v in masses so compact that the
first ranks are obliged to advance
to certain death.
The assaulting columns debouch
from the village of Damloup,
below the fort and separated
from it by a ravine which they
are obliged to cross to attain the
slopes near the fort. For three
days this spot has been the scene
of carnage which has saturated

German Story of Battle.
BERLIN. June 5, by wireless to Sayville,
N. Y'*-An authoritative account
of the North sea battle, which, was
issued here today, gives the first detailed
picture of the progress of the
great engagement between the German
high sea fleet and that of the British.
Many details of the engagement are
suppressed for strategic reasons, leaving
unsatisfied for the present the> German
publics thirst for interesting touches
in regard to the individual achievements
of the German warships and the
manher" Vn th<? mighty British
vessels were -ent to the bottom/
The recital, however, meets clearly
what is characterized as the British
attempt to explain defeat bv the statement
that th?- German sea forces in the
action were much larger yian tho?'
which the British were able to bring
into play.
German Ships Outnumbered.
This account as giuen out today declares
explicitfv that, twenty-six * of Admiral
Jeilicoe's most, powerful battleships,
including six ??I the most modern
bjueen Elizabeth class, and t heentire
British flying wing, compose'-,
of battle cruisers equal in every re'er,
exeunt arin'-i protection, to
dread naughts, v. ere en'gaged in al! bu
the early stages of the day battle. The
fleet thus assembled surpassed jn tonnage
and v. eight of broadsides tin
German force engaged, was at least
equally modern and was far speedier
than the squadron of German predreadnaught*
which, lumbering along
a* eighteen or nineteen knots, were
soon left, far to the rear by their
swifter consorts, out of the main action.
For obvious reasons the recital
leaves untold the tab- of damages sus

were able to shower the British with a
hail of shell which. at a range of eight

wrought havoc to ships' vitals. The ponderous
British projectiles naturally were
no less effective, but the Armstrong and

He view of Great Battle.
JvONDON, June 5. 3:30 p.m.?The
latest reports received by the British
admiralty enables the Associated Press J
to give the following review of the J
en!/ii oc.nen t ,.#? U?. . I
with various incidents and results, as
view from the British side:
During the night ?>/ May 31 -.June !
British destroyers made a determined
attack On the retreating German battle
fleet, which hastened its flight The
British fleet remained on the scene of
the battle during the morning of June
1 and traversed the field four times,
finding no enemy to fire upon. The
commander-in-chief took his fleet abek
to its bases at his leisure, and five
hour* after its arrival reported the
battle fleet ready for action.
As regards the German losses, defi;
nitfc evidence, It is declared, has now
%
j
A<iStlliP
t
been obtained that they were deliberately
falsified, and that the following
were destroyed:
Two battle cruisers; one at least,
and probably two. battleships ; four
light cruisers, eight destroyers and one
submarine.
The remainder of the German battle
cruiser squadron may have reached
home ports, but the ships were all severely
damaged, as also were ships of
the Koenig class, which came under
the fire of a portion of the British battle
fleet.
Besides the above the Associated
Press has obtained information from
returned officers of the fleet that they
are able to identify the lost German
battle cruisers as the Hindenburg and the
Lutzow.
Naval officials here point out that on
account of their t?roximlty*rt? home
ports some of the German vessels
which were as badly injured as was the
British cruiser Warrior would have
been a.b!c to make port.
Fig-tire Effect on Future.
In view of the latest report of the
admiralty on the naval battle of last
week the press and public, are devoting
their attention to computing the losses
of the two navies and the effect the engagement
s likely to have on future
naval warfare. The British estimate
of eighteen German ships lost, as comparer!
with fourteen British, is accepted
by the majority and the result is
now claimed as a complete victory for
the British fleet.
so !ai the German denial of the
British claim is concerned it is pointed
out that the Germans did not admit
he loss of The cruiser Eibing until the
nival of some survivors from her in
Holland, and this is cited as confirma oii
1 ha f the Germans oonce;;! their
losses until forced by circumstances to
veal them. This is made possible, it
argued, by the fact that the British
occurred in daylight and are
known to the Germans, while the Gerao
losses took jflace in twilight or
Her dark.
Heavy Loss of Officers.
A total of 333 officers were killed in
h< .Jutland battle, according to a list
sued by the admiralty today. This

FOR IMF MAY
Terminal Company Gives Out
Checks to Its Former
Employes.
ADJUSTMENT OF TROUBLE
REGARDED AS PROBABLE
: Announcement Made That Foremen
Accused of Employing ' Padrone-'
Methods Have Been Disciplined.
The . fljournment at. an early hour
ji Mi?- i?: *r r; i 111K "i < ?:? ?'.?ru!?*r Pirijuyjes
of the Washington Terminal Company,
in order that th? men might draw
their pay, and the expression of the belief
of strike leader.-' that the matters
causing th*- trouble will he adjusted
within a few days, were the features
this rooming of the seventh day of the
Union station strike.
That disciplinary notion already has
been taken in the ease of certain of
the foremen under accusation by the
strikers as participants in the alleged
"padrone system" under which they
have had to work, was announced in a
statement given out last night by A. M.
Keppel, superintendent of the terminal
company.
Text of the Statement.
Today Mr. Keppcl said that the corporation
he represent:; had nothing further
to add to th . statement, v. hich
was as follows
. "A committee representing employes
in the ear and electric car lighting departments
demanded for the first time
in a letter which I received from them
lb a.m. Monday. May 29, the dismissal
of certain foremen by 9 a.m. Tuesday,
May 30, twenty-three hours later. The
j fact is, an investigation or* alleged irregularities
against certain foremen
had been started some time before the
i receipt of the demand referred to. That
investigation was coinpleted tonight
and resulted in disciplinary action
being1 taken with certain foremen. The
charges made against the foremen, and
received after an investigation had
been started, beclouded tin* issue involved,
which has to do with decided
increases in rates of pay and reinstatement
of certain employes whose service
was found not necessary for the com'pany's
interest, and which on full considers
f ion th< company was unable to
grant
George H. Volte, first vice president of
the Brotherhood of Railway < '"arm en of
America, in reading the statement from
the platform this morning, called attention
to discrepancies between it and the
contentions of the strikers, but at the
same time prophesied a general and satisfactory
"housecleaning" in he company's
affairs that would end the trouble
land would, in all probabiliy, be followed
by overtures looking to the return of the
men to work.
Men Receive Tbc-ir Pay.
! Following the meeting at Sth and F
streets northeast, he strikers, some 400
strong, and headed by their committee
and a banner, paraded in orderly fashion
to the east end of the station, where company
officials were waiting t<> pay the
j men their May wages. A few station
police were on hand, but served merely as
j spectators as the committee, first, and
I then the men, received their checks. Each
former employe g f two checks, one for
wages and one for 10 cents* rebate for
the last two days of May, from money
i already paid in by them to the funds of
j the relief society.
"There is reason to believe that the
matters leading to the strike will be
settled in a very few days and we will
see every one, including the men laid
j off just prior to the strike, return to
work,". Mr. Nolte told the men this
morning. This, he said, notwithstanding
the recent receipt by every I
striker of the following letter, signed
by the master mechanic of the company:

L. A. Sterne Talks to Strikers.
t
L. A. Sterne, volunteer organizer for
the District of the American Federation
of Labor, addressed the meeting
and told the men he hoped to see the
day when there should l^c no distinc-;b
tion drawn between skilled and unskilled v
labor. He prophesied victory for the o
union and said that U" necessary it g
would receive th?* support of every
similar organization in-the District. He
announced that at the meeting of the
Central Labor t'nlon tonight he in- | s
tended to introduce a resolution pledg- | t
ng both moral and financial support of .
the strikers by that body. and emphasized,
the importance of maintain- p
ing a union, once it is organized, say- n
ing that often, when points at issue
have been gained, members become t(
apathetic and the organization lichees
into a weakness which is taken advantage
of at a later date.
Tl v Godshall complimented the men m
on their behavior, saying that this was I
the first strike with which he had ever i ^
had to do during which he had not j fi
i.? . n bothered bj at least one "drunk." |t]
He said lu has not yet seen or heard

| "I believe that those making- the in;
vestigat ion now under way have come

; their task t<> the very best of their
ability." Mr. Xolte told the men this A
morning. "Their findings will he found s,
to amount not only to an indictment
but to a conviction."

The fact that there are some sixtv-six a:
different sizes of national flags and n;
of various proportions in use in the cl
executive departments of the govern- 01

The order first directs that national

Germany Calls on Landsturm.
LONDON. June 5.?A Reuter dispatch
from Zurich says that members
of the German landsturm, class of 1917,
who are living abroad, have been ordered
to return home immediately. The

which includes, in addition to trained
soldiers between the ages of thirty-nine

'ROMISES FREE AS THE AIR (
ill Three Factions Have Polled Na- (
tional Body, None Failing' to Get
Most Positive Assurance of
Ultimate Success.
BY EARL GODWIN.
CHICAGO. June 5.?The bigj
tir in Chicago today is the threeornered
contest between the astiring
delegations from the Disrict
of Columbia. The settlenent
of this remarkable trianguar
political squabble will prohibit'
come about before nightfall.
i
tnd with it the question of who
.hall be national committeeman.j
Deep down in the heart of the
ight. the national committeinan
[uestion is the main issue. The
jradshaw-\Villisten faction seemo
be favoring Barrv Bulkier:
"rank Hogan refuse- to say that
te is for Henry H. Flather. but
very one else says he is. and the
Tiller-Chase duo is. of course,
or Chapin Brown, the present in'umbent.
Each Claims to Have Wen.
As the national committee settled itelf
for what the membership hopes
rould be tn entertaining row, scores
f others flocked into the Coliseum to
;et a line on the District of Columbia
umpus, which has attracted more atention
here than any other contest for
eats on the floor. Every one expressed
he greatest confidence in the. outcome?
hat is, each faction claimed to have
oiled the national committee with the
. ? . t
tost complete success. r>ome one is not 1
elling the exact truth about it: that's
Iain to be seen.
Frank Hog^n, former bull moose naional
committeeman, now doing: all he
an to get a seat for himself on the
oor and to unseat Chapin Brown from
he national committee, thinks the old
uard would like to seat him so as to
eep him from going: over to the proressive
crowd and giving it out that
he republicans are still a lot of unreenerate
standpatters.

IOLONEL NO 'HEALING AGENCY'
31d Guard Indorses Progressives' Desire
for Harmony Candidate, But
Says Roosevelt Cannot Bring
the Desired Unity.
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, June 5.?The openng
of this week, which promises
:o be one of the must momentous
n the history of the republican
tarty, finds all factions impressed
Aith the gravity of the impending
occasion. Before Saturday
tight arrives it will he demon-trated
whether the party has bv:ome
united and ready to enter
:he presidential campaign with
'easonable hope of victory, or
whether the folly of.1912 is to he
'epeated and the republicans
loomed to ignominious defeat at
:he hands of a solidified demo:ratic
organization, intrenched in
power and holding the support of
1 large section of the electorate.
Today no leader is able to assure himself
or convince his associates which path
will be followed. The wish for reunion
is sincere; the terms which each faction
proposes to the other are severe. The
progressives say in page advertisements
in the papers, "Heal the wound to the
bone." They insist that the nomination
-jf Roosevelt ic the only ointment. The
j 1,1 guard declares "we subscribe to your
sentiment. but reject your healing
igencv."
Hughes Target of All Pactions.
The most impressive fact outstanding
odav is another ferocious drive against
he suggested candidacy of Justice
riughes. prosecuted with equal savagery
jy the allies and favorite sons on the one
ide and Roosevelt partisans on the otheV.
rhey have a common purpose?to destroy
lim?but conflicting objects after anlihilating
is effected.
The attack of The Roosevelt men is by
or the more desperate. Known to be
villing to support Mr. Hughes should he
>e nominated, they are imposing condiions
which would seem to preclude his
lomination. They declare outright that
f Justice Hughes does not announce his
lews and platform before nomination
hey w:ll refuse him and name a third
icket headed by Roosevelt.
In issuing this virtual ultimatum,
ft-hich. it is claimed, is sanctioned by
he/colonel, they know full well that
here is no more likelihood of Mr. Jusice
Hughes making such a declaration
han there is of the moon turning to
rreen cheese.
The method of assault being used by
he allies and favorite sons takes the
orm of a combination of their forces
o withhold a majority from Mr.
lughes through several ballots and
mtil his friends tire of the light and
Irop him.
Many Are "Band-Wagon" Delegates
As repeatedly stated in these dislatches,
the essential weakness in this
me of strategy is the fact that the
amps of. the allies include delegates
vho will not support to the last ditch
he fortunes of their favorites, espeially
when those fortunates give the
irst indication of being upon the wane.
These delegates are not taking for
tie last ditch. They have their binoclars.
or highest lens, trained upon a
and wagon, and each man. deep down
n his heart, is praying that he may
ee it first.
The favorite sons and allies appear,
owever. to be sincere in their coniction
that they have combined
trength equal to more than a ma>rity
of the convention, although they
re not certain how long they can
laintain it intact. The assertion is
?peatedly made in the camps of the
li es today that before the week-end
ughes will ceaste to be considered a
n IWJ . liiia Ii.f,aiuvu a.O a. uiuil
y Hughes' friends, and they tell their
-mpathizers to sit tight and take that
urdle when they coma to it.
The belief prevails among the rank
id file of the old guard that the
-nnination of Col. Roosevelt by the
gular republicans is a contingency
> remote as to be negligible. They
el that he could only be named with
teir united consent, and no condition
ius far threatens which warrants
teir yielding it. \ '
rogressives Make Violent Attacks.
They appreciate the colonel's desire
dictate the candidate and sympa- 1
ize with his objection to Mr. Hughes,
ho would be young enough for a secid
term if elected. They also underand
the bitterness of George W. Perns
against Hughes. Mr. Perkins was
ven the unhappiest hours of his life
Mr. Hughes in the great insurance
vestigation in New York, and he has
iver forgiven the prosecutor in that
lebrated case.
Violent attacks were made in the
orning papers upon Mr. Hughes by
1 the progressive leaders, the most
vere being by Harold Ickds, the evlsnt
object being to drive him by
unts into declaring himself una valine
as a nominee. Mr. Hughes'
lends say that as long as the justice
trains from putting himself beyond
e reach of the convention by a volunry
declaration these attacks are as
