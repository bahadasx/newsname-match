I SWAT THE HOOKWORM; VOTE TOMORROW
The citizen who fails to turn out and vote at the park board elec
tion tomorrow will be deliberately letting tbe front yard of his city
run to seed.
He will be inexcusably neglecting the all-important feature
Which makes his city home valuable and a good place to live.
He will be willfully or lazily failing to provide properly for his
children.

HUGHES GERMAN CANDIDATE ?
JUSTICE ES REQUESTED TO DECLARE HIMSELF
SHALL THE BOY GRAB
THE HOT MINCE PIE
OR THE COLD JAM?
_^|^fe^ IIK'AdO, June 5. The men at this convention who will really
A^T^^W pick the republican candidate for president are likt ;i child with
■P 0 Tt/cH^ Pa«n*'u' memories who has strayed alone into the family pantry.
miff*Si_y Up there on the shelf is fresh Roosevelt mince pie, piping
hot with hard sauce. I.iii then, how aboul Old (iliaid colic I LJet-
ter go slow on that.
Easily within reach is a dish of Hughes jam. Hut the progressive switch
hang! by the door and many an anatomy is still tingling from the last time
that was used. So it is slow on the jam also.
Here in the cooler is fine Fairbanks ice cream, but we aren't looking for
ice cream this year.
On other shelves are "Weeksmuffins, Burton hard tack, Cummins break
fast Pood and other highly recommended dishes from cookies lo cabbage all
of superior quality for anybody that likes that sort of thing anil some of them
guaranteed to be free from colic or trouble with switches.
The child in the pantry doesn't care a whoop for any of them. I lis fancy is
for HI E OR JAM, and the thing he is balancing all the time is the chance of the
colic against the chance of the switch. *
If you could remove either,
he would take his finger out of
hit mouth and make up his mind
In a flash. As it Is, he stands
there fiddling and kee|ie every
body guessing.
One moment he makes a start
for the Roosevelt pie. with loud
appluuse, and you think the thing
' is aa good as settled.
And the next minute he has a
vivid recollection of what the
stand-pat element might do to
him, or thinks of Henry Ford and
his threats, or gets a warning
from hyphens or pacifists, und
you are ready to bet on the
Hughes jam.
The |irofet»slonal prophets
go to and fro anil look wise
ami talk as if they had sure
t tips. But do not lie deceived
l.y that. Nothing else that
man does is done more easily.
I've b.-i-ii covering national
conventions for _M years and
never saw one without its
set of prophets, none of
whom turned out to have any
' more of a foi-clia.nl.-.1 cinch
on ilii.ii-> ih*<>. anybody else.
There Isn't any money In the
prophet business, but there must
be no end of mysterious satisfac
tion, judging by the way it is fol
lowed!
Of course something else comes
, Into this job here besides prefer
ence for hot Roosevelt pie or for
cold Hughes jam, aud that Is the
way about FIFTEEN LKADINO
MEN will size up advantages and
disadvantages when it comes to a
showdown. Not merely advan
tges to the party, hut other advan
tages; AS TO THEMSELVES,
FOB INSTANCE. These haven't
decided anything in their own
•■» minds. How, then, prephets, clair
voyants and seers, do you have
any sure dope about it?
Only one thing is clear, If It is
| to be pie it will have to be grabbed
j ln a rush, so as to knock out any
I thought about colic.
And that ia where the "old
guard" of stand-pats thinks it has
the game in hand.
It has 208 votes that it cancast
for anybody it chooses from David
Lamar, the wolf of Wall street, to
Oliver Osborne, the myth.
To these they add 416 other
delegates equally controlled by
other gentlemen that are equally
solid against a stampede, and they
tell you that all the noise between
"* here and Oyster bay can't nomi
nate under such circumstances.
The fact that thla year there
- are no delegation contests, to
amount to anything, Ik a sign that
these gentlemen may be sound In
. their views.
Delegation contests mean that
the gentlemen who control things

BERLIN, June .I.—Civilians in
Germany must not eat meat for
the next eight weeks, Adolph
Yon Batocki, food dictator, frank*

food situation with tlie United
Press,
He declared that this should
not alarm Germany, nor should it
elate Germany's enemies. If the
coming harvest is only medium,
starvation of Germany through a
British blockade will be impos
sible.
"The siege has just begun," he 1
said. "The coming eight weeks
may cause discomfort to the Ger
mans who are fond of meat. Fur
thermore, the meat shortage is
apt to continue three months.
"Cattle are lean now because of
the poor harvest last year, and
cannot he slaughtered. \v?e niust
wait until they are fattened.
Meanwhile we have enough meat
for the military hospitals arid
places where it is urgently
needed.
"There is enough food In Ger
many, but It is necessary for
civilians to eat no meat for the
next eight weeks to insure a sup
ply this winter. Probably meat
cards will he issued throughout

weather is highly providential.

"Well, I'm willing to do that,"
replied Pettit, "but 1 have an idea

MY DEAREST—
I am willing to confess that
you are no beauty, although you
work conscientiously to disguise
this fact.
To a certain extent you suc
ceed, but you should give more
study to the subject.
Last night, for example, your
dress was exceedingly unbecom
ing. It accentuated your natural!
pallor to a disagreeable extent.
You should try sitting near a
rose-shaded lamp. The last girl
I proposed to always pulled that
trick and it worked for some
months.
Of course, she was really pret
ty, but even In har case the rone
tinted light added 2a per cent.
Please try it, dear, because I
really want to learn to love you,
for I hate to think of your poor,
old rather living through his old
age with all his money and no
son-in-law to help him spend it.
With all my love. JOHN.

CHICAGO, Juno .'..-The old
guard made its first definite prof
fer to the progresslv s today.
Se* nr.- In Iti own belief that It
can control the votes of a ma
jority of the delegates, the domi
nant lories of republicans want
Hltghes. But they only want
Hughes if they can be convinced
lie can be a winner next Novem
ber.
Therefore their preliminary
feeler to the progressives was to
ascertain whether an arreement
would be possible with Hughes
as a candidate, running on any
sort of a platform which the pro
greaslvai might require.
Whut Plan Is.
The old guard Isn't belittling
the power which It feels the pro
gressives can swing and went so
far as to embrace a scheme by
which the progressives might be
able to say that they were the
ones who put Hughes over.
The scheme was to have the
progressives meet Wednesday nnd
not later than Thursday night, to
nominate Hughe?. The:i by r'n
day or Saturday, the republican
convention would choose the same
standard bearer.
The progressives could very
well "point with pride" to the
fact that, by their action in nam
ing Hughes, I hey had forced the
G. O. P. Into selecting the same
leader.
Bosses Perplexed.
The progressive leaders, who
have been watting some sort ol
an olive branch suggestion, made
It known today they were first
for Roosevelt - and enly for
Hughes If some sort of a "satl.i
factory" statement of principles'
could be extracted from the jus
tice. Failing that, (hey flaunted
the big stick of a third ticket.
There appeared very llltls
doubt today that Hughes can b«
nominated it the big three—Pen
rose. Barnes and Crane—say so.
But the big three do not want to
say so until they can he assured
of a united party behind Hughes.
They do not think Kescevell
can possibly draw all tha votes
ot a re-united party.
They do not think any of tha
"favorite sous" is well enough
known nationally, or Is of suffi
cient potency to defeat Wilson,
without progressive support.
In other words, the old guard
was in the position of having con
trol, but not knowing what to de
with its control.
