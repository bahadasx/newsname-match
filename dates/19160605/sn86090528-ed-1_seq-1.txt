Pr, Livermore, of the Chic;kaslia
hospital stated thin afternoon that the
condition of Pavis was serious and
might l)0 said to bo dangerous. The
doctor Raid that the pistol ball had
penetrated tho loft lung; that the
lung was badly congested with blood
and that tho woundod man was expec
torating blood. It was also st'ated
Mint It would ho almost impossible
and very dangerous tr remove the ball,
or to attempt its removal at prepent.
Hob Pavis, a Hock Island employee,
was shot and dangerously wounded
Sunday morning, at 12:30 o'clock, by
a negro known to the police as Jess
Smith. Pavis was returning to his
homo on South Shepherd street, from
his work at the Hock Island shops.
He was accompanied by .lolin Heuth
erly, Avin Franklin and another young
man whose name iH not known to the
police. -
According to statements made by
Pavis, and corroborated by his com
panions, tho four young men were
walking along the street, making no
noise and misbehaving in no way,
when the negro crossed the street di
agonally,' and walked up to them and
commenced using abusive and inde
cent language.
After saying a few words the negro
slapped lleatherly. knocking his hat
oft, turned to Franklin and told him
to "beat it." As Franklin "beat It"
tho negro-drew his gun and shot Pa
vis.' The ball, from a .;!8 caliber automat
ic, passed through the muscle of the
left arm and penetrated the left side.
,It wu-', understood this morning that
it had lodged in the upper psrt of the
left lung. However, a phone call to
the Chickasha hospital failed to verify
this statement. .
Sheriff Bailey and Peputy Castie
num were on the scene within a few
minutes of the shooting. An ambu
lance was called aijd the womded man
moved to the hospital. Tht compan
ions of Pavis had already telephoned
the police and police officers soon ar
rived on ths- spot.
At 12: ISO -Sunday afternoon Sheriff
Bailey located, the negro in a house
,on South Shepherd street, and placed
him under arrest, transferred him to
tho county! Jail only to leave with him
in a short time- for Anadarko where
he was taken for sale keeping.
Scarcely . had the negro, Smith,
been locked up in the county jail,
when someone called the jail and stat
ed that Smith's people had requested
the sheriff to convey to him the infor
mation that "if he ever did any pray-'
ing now was sure the time to get busy
and pray." "'.'.. !,
A few rapid inquiries, a short inves
tigation, and Sheriff liailey satisf'-cd
himself that if a lynching wp. to be
avoided it would be necessary to get
the negro out of Chii kasha at once.
''il!i"ir a 'rvire car and telling his
deputies, "I'm gone to Oklahoma City
vun 'the nigger," Sheriff Bailey load-
ed his prisoner aboard and left Chick-
asha, 'northward-bound, in a vloud of
'lust. However, the sheriff did not go
to Oklahoma City with his prisoner.
On the contrary he took him to Ana
darko and delivered him to the sheriff
of Caddo county. .Telephone, messag
es received, from. Anadarko' state that
the Caddo .sheriff, soon became un
easy and repioved the negro to a jail
in some other city, the place not
known.
That Sheriff Bailey made no mis
take in figuring the possibility of a
mob was shown '.lien, within I'.O min
utes of the time he left the jail with
his prisoner the mob assembled at
that point.
Calmly and quietly, without noise
lr demonstration, under an efficient
leadership, no ono masked and n one
creating any disturbance, the advance
guard of the determined men nmretiod
to the jail and stated to Jailer Pryden
that they were looking for a negro and
thought lie had him.
Jailer Pryden, just as quietly told
them thut the negro was not there.
."He was here, boys," said air. Pryden,
"but ho is not here now." The lead
ers of the band asked that they ba al
lowed to "inspect" the jail. This re
quest was granted and 'after a thor
ough investigation the party left sat
isfied that their man was not In Gra
dy county's strong box.
The crowd which went to the jail
and made" tho demand on the jailer
was composed of approximately i0
men, while fully 2(10 are said to hilve
lined up along Choctaw avenue, in
front of the court house, remaining
there until the report came that "our
nigger ain't here, boys."
From the county jail the advance
guard of the vengeance seekers walk
ed to the city hall, at Sixth street and
Choi'taw avenue, pesk Sergeant Els-
ton was informed of the wishes of
the "boys." "Have you got the nig
ger?" asked the leaders of Sergeant
Elston.
Sergeant Elston replied that he did
not have the negro.
,"May we search your jail?" asked the
leaders. .
. Having no prisoners in the jail, the
sergeant turned tho wheel which au
tomatically unlocks all the cell doors,
simultaneously, threw open the door
to the "bull pea," and invited the
"crowd" to "step in and help your-
Satisfied that the negro wa.j not in
that department the demand was then
made that, the female department of
tho cRy jail be thrown open. No pris
oners fitting in that section, likewise,
Sergeant Elston opened the doors and
suffered the cells of the female department-
to be searched.
No negro being forthcoming, the
leaders of the "avengers" marshalled
their forces out on the street, and
stated to them, in substance, "They
have got our nigger out of the city,
boys. "We'll have to wait until he is
brought back for trial."
Shcrnr Bailey stated tins morning
that he felt: that he had done his duty
in removing tho negro from Grady
county. He said, "I am a sworn offi
cer of the law. It was my duty to
see that the negro was protected from
mob violence and I am glad I have
been able to be instrumental in saving

By United Press. '
London, Juno 5. The admiralty to
day continued to maintain that Ger
man losses in the gerat sea battle last!
week reached a total of one hundred
and thirteen thousand tons, or nearly
the same as the British losses, but
eighty thousand more tons than tho
German admiralty admits.
Tho British claim that tho Germans
lost tho battleship Westfulen, the bat
tle cruisers Perflinger and Lutzow,
ono light cruiser, three additional de
stroyers and one submarine, tho loss
of which Germany has not admitted.
Vessels arriving from Copenhagen
and telling tales of the heavy losses
iu the sea battle crushed the hopes of
hundreds of British families that
their members who were in the fi'Tht
might be alive.
Reports from the sea coasts say
that the Warsprltg came back damag
ed, discrediting the claim of the Ger
mans that vessel was sunk. ,

Food Dictator is Interviewed.
By United Press.
Berlin. June !. Heir Adolph von
Batockl, the new food distator, hold
ing ono of the most important positions
in Germany at the present time, told
the United Press today that Germans
would not be permitted to eat meat
during the next eight weeks,
Batockl said the now regulations
need not cause alarm in Germany or
elation among the allies. He said
there is enough food for Germany,
declaring that the starvation block
ade of the allies would fail to accom
plish its purpose even if the coming
German crop is only moderately boun
tiful. The meat shortage in Germany is
expected to continue for three months.
No meat will be eaten during the next
eight weeks because cattle are too
lean, duo to last year's poor harvest
and they must be fattened.
Note: The foregoing interview
was the first granted by Batockl since
his Appointment. The United Press
obtained from him a frank discussion
oi the food problems ot Germany, the
gist of bis interview being printed

ing to pay too high a price for it.
Some contend that this means that
Hughes is not acceptable to them.

hear, the New York Mooser, that if

of the German-American alliance.

AUSTIN CALLS FOR FUNDS
TO ADVERTISE COLLEGE
' In response to a reijuest from tho
Daily Express for a, statement in re
gard to the necessity for publicity for
the college at the present time, Pres
ident Austin loday prepared for pub
lication an appeal 'to the citisens of
Chickasha, in which he succinctly sets
forth the situation declaring that there
never was a time when advertising
was more, needed by the institution
than now. He attributes the rapid
growth of the school during the past
two years largely to tho systematic
advertising campaign that he has con-
ducted and asks the citizens to con- tial and something must bo done to
timie to support him in his efforts to find these additional young women

A, C. Boswell bought a piece of
trouble for himself when he went to
the county jail yesterdav to tell the
sheriff's officers that someone had
been threatening him. After Boswell

the information that he wanted a fel

law.
"Haven't you got a gun on you
