Colonel "Won't Get More
Than 200 Votes at the
Outside, Leaders of the
r Old Guard Say, While His
Strength In, Convention
May Be Only 150.
Chicago, June S--The move
ment '. for the . nomination of
Justice Hughes today took on
the aspects bf a genuine boom.
Arrivals brought evidences of
sentiment. in favor of the jurist
and men who have been identi
fied with the Old Guard of the
Republican party declare that
. many delegates instructed for
' others were ready to turn their
votes to him after the first bal-
'' lot. . ' -- '
v'The lack of controlling, leadership
" fcy the men who Have composed the
Old . Guard is emphasized on every
hand. They express themselves as'
i not favoring Justice Hughes for any
ft-son of personality but 'because the
-delegates bring first hand reports of
'I eentiiment'; from the. states, believing
'.'.that he can be the harmonizer -who
i can rehabilitate the party, and .bring
- tin the Progressive strength. On ev--,
! ry hand explanations- are sought as
to the for or against sentiment to
i ward Roosevelt.
' Republican leaders, after a canvas
(today declared that Col. Roosevelt's
t ultimate strength Would not foe more
than 200 delegates -at the outside and
i they (believe the number - would 'be
i narrowed to 150. It is asserted that
j the remaining 750 or 800 delegates
would not vote him under any cir
' cumstance's. " .'
It was pointed outthat when state
delegations were selected,, it was ex
' pected Roosevelt would be a strong
factor and probably a candidate. Men
' were chosen who were believed to be
for harmony which leaders say is not
, eynonimous with Roosevelt, and are
,; i regarded therefore, " as not of the
i etampedable" 'type. The great mass
of delegates are uninsructed and (are
' counted on to vote- fpr any man who
, can bring . a majority of the Pro
' gressives to the Repufblican fold.
All talk of demanding a pre-conven-
tion statement from Justice. Hughes
Jeis a candidate of his nomination, has
1 practically ibeen abandoned. It was
' talked of last night but today it has
Ibeen eliminated from the discussions.
It is generally agreed that the justice

while he occupies a place on the su

national 'questions which will be an
issue' in the campaign.-

OF PROF. ATLAS
Settlement May Be Reached
Before Tomorrow, How
ever, Belief Is
A hearing is scheduled In te su
. Jerior court tomorrow on Prof. James
'Atlas' appeal from the county com.
njissioners. It is reported, however,
.that a settlement will 'be reached in
the case before the hearing is held.
Although Prof. Atlas is said to
, have been making determined efforts
to gain the good will of members of.
- the TTniversalist church who remon
strated against a renewal of the Hotel
Atlas liquor license, his . attempts
4iave been in vain. The . church is
' said to have refused to- withdraw the
'remonstrance. "
The only concession to Atlas will
(be the granting of permission for him
to sill his license to somebody else.
Then the license will be moved from
the Hotel Atlas. The hotel proprie
tor took the appeal when the com
missioners refused to grant a renewal
of the license after various witnesses
.had testified regarding disturbances in

MUSICAL GUILD
WILL OBJECT TO
NON-UNION BAND
Park Commissioners to Re
ceive Complaint on Sum
mer Concert List.
ORGANIZATION WITH
CARDS NOT FAVORED
Olympics Slighted For
Bridgeport Marines, Say
Union Officers.
A protest from Bridgeport Musical-
Protective union. Local No. 63, will be
sent the park commissioners against
allowing the Bridgeport Marine band
to play two concerts during this
month, j The members of the Marine
band are not members of the- union.
In the schedule of concerts for the
month recently published by -the park
commissioners, the Bridgeport Marine
band is given the concerts for Thurs
day evening, June-15, at 8 o'clock at
Lafayette ' park and for Wednesday
evening, June 2 8, at the same hour at
Old Mill green.
The Olympic band, whose members
all carry union cards, has not been
considered by the park board for the
June concerts. - The fact that a non
union band had been given a concert
engagement was discussed by members
of the union last Thursday evening anS
is still a topic of discussion. Just what
action will be taken has not been de
cided but ax formal protest will be
maSle to ' the - park commissiofcers by
the officers of the local... '. .
' The Olympic .band has J5 members
who 'are home owners aAd taxpayers
and feel they have been slighted In the
apportionment of the concert work.
Some of their friends are now making
a canvas of public spirited citizens and
business people at Bull's Head and In
the Golden Valley for the purpose of
.raising a subscription to defray the- ex
penses of concerts there by the riana.
The Olympic band is scheduled for
concerts later in the season,but wheth
er the Olympic band gets one or none
of the concerts has nothing to do with
the complaint of the Union members.
They object to having non-union music
employed at the concerts.

Were landed on June . 1 at Monte
Christ! and Puerto Plata. The fort at
Puerto Plata was occupied after re
sistance of two hours. One marine of

WOULD CONVERT
EAST BRIDGEPORT
TO MUNICIPALITY
Samuel Dawe and John Col
gan Threaten Petition for
Separate City
EAST SIDE SLIGHTED
BY ADMINISTRATION
Aldermen, "Deader Than
Julius Caesar, "'Get No
Improvements
Samuel Dawe of 1,081 East Main
street and John H. Colgan of, 301 Arc
tic street, both widely known residents
of East Bridgeport and extensive
property owners there, have a plan to
ask the general assembly to set apart
the section of the Pequonneck river
as a seperate municipality. Both men
are5 heavy, taxpayers and they claim
that for years the eastern section of
the city has been slighted In the way
of public improvements and unless
what they consider a fairer division of
the public improvements can be ob
tained they i intend to get up a petition
to the legislature to have East Bridge
port made a city by itself.
Whether the name of the new city
shall be East Bridgeport Or Reming
ton City they have not yet decided.
They claim they have a large number
of taxpayers and residents of the East
Side in favor of the project and they
would be . able to - muster a goodly
showing of " citizens with convincing
arguments, should they decide to bring
the question to Hartford for settle
ment.
In opening the fight to get more im
provements for the East Side, Samuel
Dawe is presenting to the common
council for consideration this evening,
petitions for the 1 extension of the
White Way in East Main street from
Stratford avenue "to Arctic street and
also for paving East Main street with
either wood blocks or Warrenite. .
When -filing these petitions with the
city clerk's office today, Mr. Dawe
said:
"The aldermen who represent the
East Side districts are deader than
Julius Caesar. They have done noth
ing for us but sit idly by while the
West side, of . the river has obtained
all the improvements. ; It is true that
Stratford avenue and some streets in
the Twelfth district have been Im
proved but looi. at East Main street.
"That is the oldest brick' pavement
in the city; it has Ibeen down 15 years
and I fathered the petition to have it
laid. ' Now it is f ul K of ruts and holes
and a disgrace to jt progressive city
like Bridgeport. Warrenite could be
laid over the foundation there or bet
ter still, wooden blocks could be laid.
"Look at . the way State street in
the West End has been laid , with
wooden blocks past Vacant lots where
there is no business, while East Main
street is neglected.- . The other day
the Connecticut Co. relaid connecting
wires . -between . the rails and after
making these repairs instead of put-
ing the bricks 'back in place the com
pany's men carted them off and filled
In the holes with dirt. -
"We pay the same taxes as 'people
on the west side of the river and we
are entitled to part of the money spent
for public improvements. We are
growing faster. Look at Remington
City. We have a population on the
East Side now twice that of Danbury
and in another year we will have
twice the population of the West side.
Unless we can get the improvements
we believe we are entitled to I think
we will be ab'le to convince the mem
bers of the General "Assembly that
the East Side should be set aside as a
city by itself.,
Mr. Dawe was a police commis
sioner under the administration of
Denis Mulvihill. He is a house
painting contractor.
John H. Colgan, former superinten
dent of streets in the administration
of Mayor Marcus L. Reynolds, had
charge of the- laying of . the 'brick
pavement in . East Main, street about
which there is so much complaint. He
favors the secession of East Bridge
port if improvements cannot be .ob
tained for that section. Today he
said: '-,
"The brick laid there was the best
obtainable and it would be standing
now had it been laid In Portland ce
ment instead of Rosedale cement. The
taxpayers of the East Side believe
they are not getting a fair share of the
puWlc improvements. Not only are
we the most , rapidly growing section
of the city but We have been neglect
ed for years.
"When we . took in . West Stratf or"d
years ago and they started to send
representatives to the council from
that section they quickly got improve
ments they wanted, new streets,
sewers, gas lights, policemen and
everything we on the East Side have
been marking time for more than 20
years while other sections of the city
have got the improvements.
"Because of the increase in popula
tion and yit."Wll soon be necessary to
change the lines of the voting districts
and add new ones. "When this takes
place you will flnd-the balance of pop
ulation is on the East Side. '
GREAT FIGHTING SHIPS
OF ENGLAND "IN BATTL
BER
Berlin, June 5, by wireless to the
Associated, Press from a staff corre
spondent, via Sayvllle. An authorita
tive account of the .North Sea battle
which was issued here today gives the
first detailed picture of the progress
of . the naval engagerdent between the
German high sea fleet and that of the
British. The main details of the bat
tle are suppressed for strategical rea
sons. This account declares explicitly
that 26 of Admiral Jellicoe's most
powerful battleships, including six of
the most modern Queen v Elizabeth
class and the entire British flying
wing, composed of battle . cruisers
equal in every respect except armor
protection to dreadnaugh ts, were en
gaged in all but the early stages of
the day battle.
The fleet thus assembled surpassed
in tonnage arid weight of broadsides
the German force engaged; was at
least equally modern and was far su
perior to the squadron of German pre
dreadnaughts which, lumbering along
at 18 or 19 knots were soon left far to
the rear by their swifter consorts, out
of the main action.
For obvious reasons, the recital
leaves untold tales of damages sus
tained by German units and the losses
in personnel.

battle tactics displayed by Admirals

Paris, June 5 i'With undiminished
violence the Germans continued their
attacks last night along the Verdun

HOMES OF DEATH
The desperate straights to which
rent seekers in this city are reduc

recent happenings.
Chief among these is the com

where crepe has been hung as an
evidence of sadness within.

than five applicants for rent to the

ness of the German marksmanship al
though it is an open secret that these
three factors were largly responsible
for the achievements of the Germans.
It is shown that the Germans on
this occasion,, unlike the Duggerbank
engagement, of cruiser 'squadrons,
were able to choose their distance and
fight considerable portions of the bat
tle at ranges of about eight miles
now ranked as a moderate distance
at which the, German and 12 inch
guns were virtually ae effective -in

British giants are armed. : Futher
more; they are far superior in rapid
ity of fire. "
Naval' experts have told the Asso
ciated Press that this was one of the
most decisive factors in the titanic
struggle. German battleships and
battle cruisers were able to show the
British with a; hail of 'shell which; at
a range of eight miles and sometimes
even closer, smashed and riddled
British armor belts and wrought
havoc to ships' vitals. , The ponder
ous British projctiles naturally were
no less effective but the Armstrong

scarcely one punch to each two from

Park City Sub. Brought To
Local Waters For Some
' Minor Repairs.
The submarine G-3, Lieut. Gygax In
command, arrived In ; Bridgeport yes
terday, to undergo minor changes in
construction by the contractors, the
Lake "Torpid o Boat Co.
The G-3 came from Newport, R. iJ,
where it has 'been with the flotilla
for the last two months. - Although
completed at the Brooklyn Navy Yaia
nearly six months ago, and having
previously undergone builders Itests
for submergence ,the G-3 has not re
ceived its official government tests.
With the necessary changes to be
made it is expected that it soon will
be in thorough condition to undergo
the trials for government- accepta
ance. The G-3's keel was laid in Bridge
port nearly four years ago. Its hull
was completed a year ago last. De
cember, when reorganization of the
Lake Torpedo Boat Co. caused the
government to tow it to New Xork
and complete installation of machin
ery at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It
was brought back to this city last
July and remained until nearly four
months ago when it left for Newport.
The submarine made a record run
under new Diesel engines last June,
coming up Long Islan I Sound with
out a breakdown or stop. The changes
now to be made are believed to be
radical improvements v in submarine
construction and their nature is not
divulged by the government.

An officer of . one of the detroyers

"The ships of the Grand Fleet went

one ship cannot light a dozen. They

screamed past high in the air.
"I watched the iron ships letting
out braodside after broadside, wicked
tongues of flames leaping through
clouds of smoke. The din of battle
was stunning, stupendous, deafening,
as hundreds of the heaviest guns in
the world roared out at once. Great

then a shell found its mark but it left

each man at a. time such as this.
"A dozen men may be knocked out
at one's side. It makes no difference
who they are. It was impossible to
see what was . happening among tho
ships of the foe. The smoke obscur
ed everything so effectually that one
could only get a glimpse at' intervals
when a kindly wind 'blew a lane
through the pall. It wasapparent
that the best ships of the enemy were
engaged ibut how many neither eye
nor glass could make out. The num
ber was certainly large.
"It was equally impossible to see
what damage w were causing. Only
the high command knew the progress
of tl-p battle. That the damage in
flicted son the Germanships was great
does not admit of any doubt. At one
time two vessels red with fire gleam
ed through the smoke,

some degree of exactness .but even
that was uncertain. Thus at ono
time It was thought that the ' Lion

any call. It transpired that her

"With the dusk came the great op

both sides made use of it to tho full.

dashed for a 'big enemy ship She
soon got into effective range and
loosed her torpedoes with deadly ef
fect on a German battleship. The
ship went down and the destroyer
raced for safety, the commander and
officers standing on tho bridge indulg
ing in mutual congratulations at their
success. At that moment a shell hit
the bridge and wiped out the entire
group.
. "It was curious to note the "efCect
of the fight on the sea. Calm at the
beginning the water soon looked as
if it were under tho influence of a
gale, so great was the turmoil caused
by the leviathan ships plower at ter
rific epeed through the waves. The
sea also seemed to bo stiff with fih
