Havoc wrought on the business of
the criminal division of the local cir
cuit cevtrt owing to the lack during the
last four month of funds with. which
to conduct jury trial3 find grand Jury
investigations, will be pointed out in a
report now being prepared In Circuit
Judse Ashford's court covering the
work of that division for the fiscal
year ending on June CO.
. Among other thing3, this ' report,
which is to be i resented to the gov
ernor on June SO, will show that dur
ing the present year a small number
cf cas?s has Leen disposed of , as
against the number handled last year.
It will also show that, at the end of
the present fiscal year, there will be a
greatf r number of cases pending and
undisposed of than at the close of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1915.'.
This year, through the lack of funds,
the criminal court, as well as the two
other divisions, has been unable to
try any jury cases during March, April,
May and June. Criminal cases now
pending number approximately 50,. but
it was pointed out today that this is
no criterion for the reason that a large
number of casea due to be investigated
by the grand jury are now waiting dis
posal owing to the lack of funds to
call the inquisitors Into session. )
- It was stated today that, had funds
been aTailable for juries, the criminal
cases now p ending undoubtedly would
have been disposed ot, and probably
several more cases. .In the past the
criminal division has been able to dis
pose of between 30 and. 40 ' cases a
month.,, ; ; . .. ... . " . . -:',".,;:.
Although funds may be available by
July 1, there probably will be no jury
trials in circuit court until after Sep

It is rumored early thia afternoon that
the Oceanic Steamship Company has
acceded to the demand of the.striK

- A rumor, entirely unconfirmed and
bearing some evidences that it 1 3 lit

Indue.:! to join the movement. Then,
the ramer. .continued, representatives
of lhati2vedcres were sent lb Japan
ese stevedores Saturday afternoon and
the Japanese were asked to Join. The
request is said to have been met with
a refusal, the Japanese declining to
enter into any; combination at this
time. '; ' '
The rumor came from Japanese wa-
terf renters, and was accompanied by
another report that this morning the
wages of the Japanese stevedores
were raised 10 cents per day, making
a daily wage of $1.45 per day.
, Both stories were denied absolutely
and in .toto at the. office of McCabe,
Hamilton & Renny Company, steve
doring firm. At this office, where any
news of the kind should certainly be
known, the story was said to have no
foundation whatever so far 4 as had
been heard. ' ;' -.-;.

Among those leaving cn the transport
last night was Col. S. D. Sturgis,,who
has been In command of the 1st Field
Artillery for the past three years. Col.
Lucian G. Berry; had beea ordered to
Honolulu to take command of this reg

is on duty with the troops in Mexico,
the date of his arrival has been indefi
nitely postponed, so that the command
of the regiment has devolved upon
