Chicago, June 5.—Uncertainty
and restraint are the dominant fac
tors here today, 48 hours before
the gavels arc to fall for the open
ing of the republican and progrcs
rive national conventions. The re
publican pre-convention drift and
swell of rumor, scml-offlcial reports
and pure gossip reeled from Hughes
to Hoosevelt, a-nl back to Tlugiics
then into the more quiet eddies of
favorite-gondom only to break in
a far flnng spray and evaporate.
From hour to hour this movement
went on while nothing seemed to
crystallze intangibly.
With 28 delegate contests re
maining on the list, the republican
national committee planned to com
plete its healings and prepare its
report today. The settlement of the
Louisiana contests by a comprom
ise giving half a vote to each con
testant is hailed as shortening the
committee's labors.
The lack of controlling leader
ship by the men who composed the
old guard, is emphasized on every
hand. They express themselves as
not favoring Justice Hughes for
whom a lively boom has been start
ed, not for any reason of person
ality, bat because the delegates
bringing first hand reports of the
sentiment from the states believe
he can be the harmonizer who can
re-habilitate the party and bring
in the progressive Htrength.
On every hand today, explana-'
tlons were sought of the failure of.
the sentiment for Roosevelt to
crystaMae. A vyeek ago, those who
opposed the nomination of Hoose
velt were feairfnl of a stampede to
him, but now it is said this is im
possible. Many cannot understand
what brought this change.

Great Britain Lost Over 300 Officers—Convinced That

Berlin. June 5. by wireless to Sayrille by a staff correspondent of

tle. which was issued here today, gives the first detailed picture of the
progress of the
creat
engagement. Hie recital meets
characterized as a British attempt to explain the defeat, by the state
ment that the German sea forces In action were much larger than the
British were able to bring Into play. The recital declares that 2# of
Vice Admiral Jellicoc's most powerful battleships, including si* of
the Queen Klizabeth class and the entire British flying wing, composed
of battle cruiscrs equal in every respect, except armor protection to
dread naughts, were engaged In all but the early stages of the day bat
tle. The fleet thus assembled surpassed in tonnage and weight of
broadsides the German force engaged, and was at least equally modern
and far speedier than the squadron of German pre-dread naughts,
which, lumbering along at 18 or 1» knots, soon were left far to the
rear by their swifter consorts, and ont. of the main action.
For obvious reasons, the recital leaves untold tlic tale of damages

off Jutland last week, had accounted
for a total of eighteen German men
of war, and that there was nothing

The statement gave the German 1

and a submarine.
