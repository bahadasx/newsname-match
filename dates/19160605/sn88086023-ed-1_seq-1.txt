HUGHES OUTLOOK

THE G.O.P. HEAD
Boom for Colonel Roosevelt Takes
Decided Slump But His Followers
are Still Optimistic.
HITCHCOCK MAKES FORECAST
Predict Nomination of Justice
Hughe on an Early Ballot; Kf forts
are lictng Made to Please the Pro
gressive Delegates so as to line
Them up for Hughes.
CHICAGO, June 5. The Hughes
boom had achieved a commanding
lead this afternoon. Progressive lead
ers privately admiied a decided slump
in the Roosevelt movement but pre
dicted a revival later.
Hitchcock declared "Hughes' no
mination on an early ballot is Inevi
table. He will receive more votes on
the first ballot than the combined
strength of favorite sons candidates."
He showed actual figures of the
tion leaders continued to feel out the
progressive sentiment regarding the
various candidates in an attempt to
attract the bull moose support The
main efforts, however, were to decor
ate the Hughes bandwagon to suit
Organized opposition to Hughes has
disappeared. Even the Root support
ers are not against Hughes. The
paramount idea is that they must
pick a candidate who can win. If
Roosevelt can convince the old or
ganization of his ability to win in No
vember, he can win the nomination.
The progressive committee named a
conference committee today to con
sult with republicans on the platform
and a candidate. The committee con
sists of George Perkins. Hiram John
son and Horace Wilkinson.
Roosevelt's secretary declared pos
itively that the colonel would not
come to the convention.
An unusual calm prevails about the
opposing headquarters. Progressives
admit that the old guard absolutely
controls the organization. They are
not worried, however, because the
stalwarts frankly admit they do npt
care to exercise their ability. Hereto
fore the progressives have serenly be
lieved that they held the only candi
date on whom it was possible to unite.
Their serenity showed signs of dis
integration however, when Hughes'
prospects brightened this afternoon.
The favorite sons sentiment of a dark
horse possibility is at a low ebb.
Hitchcock's announcement showed
that 3," 4 delegates were instructed
for favorite sons. It takes 493 to no
minate. The credentials committee today
handled the contests In Louisiana and
Texas.
Perkins declared positively that tha
progressives have not asked Hughes
any questions or tried tn force a defi
nite announcement from him.
The Washington state progressive
delegation has arrived and presented
indications of an insurgency move
."gainst Perkins' plea for harmony.
Thomas Murphine of Seattle was el
ected chairman of the delegation.
Austin Griffiths declared that the pro
gressives should remain separate and

amen.
