WOMEN'S PARTY OPENS
MEETING IN CHICAGO
Chicago, June 5.The Women's
party, meeting in its first conven
tion, struck its initial snag today
when it tried to crowd 2,500 dele
gates representing a dozen million
women into the Blackstone theater,
which has a seating capacity of only
1,800.
Before noon, following a half day
of, unexpected registration, no one
doubhted that the three-day conven
tion which is held to impress the Re
publicans and Progressives with the
women voters' power would call for
numerous overflow meetings.
Women voters from the eleven
"free" states were given the first
prominence today and will continue
to hold first place in the convention
tomorrow and the day following.
"Free" women had free access to
the main floor of the theater. Other
women crowded into the balconies
and attended the overflow meetings.
Miss Alice Paul, national chairman,
opened the meeting at 2 o'clock this
afternoon but did not remain long as
presiding officer.
The rules of the Woman's party say
that the permanent chairman must
be selected from one of the eleven
states in which women are allowed
to vote. Up to the time of the bal
loting no one had any idea who the
first temporary chairman of the
Woman's party would be.
The principal business of the after
noon was the naming of committees
and reports from the eleven equal suf
frage states delegates.
A reception has been planned for
this evening.
NYMORE HIGHWAY
PROBLEM MAY BE
SOLVED TONIGHT
The problem of constructing a new
Nymore highway and bridge over the
Mississippi river inlet will probably
be solved tonight at the special meet
ing of the city council.
It is reported that the city officials
and officials of the M. & I. at a con
ference Friday reached an agreement
and that the new highway will be
constructed in the present location.

BEMIDJI NINE
DEFEATS PARK
RAPIDS 8 TO 0
Eannerberg Twirls Excellent Game
Visitors Do Not Get Past
Second Base.
THREE HUNDRED FANS
WITNESS SECOND GAME
Local Team Commences Scoring in
First Inning 75 Park Rapids
Fans Present.
Bemidji won its second game of the
season Sunday afternoon at the new
athletic park when the Park Rapids
nine was defeated by a score of 8 to
0. The visitors never had a chance
to score, not a man being able to get
past second base. When hits meant
runs for the Park Rapids team, the
Bemidji offensive tightened up and
every rally was checked.
Twirls Good Game.
The feature of the game was the
twirling of Kannerberg. He allowed
only two hits, one of these being a
scratch infield single. He struck out
12 men, nine of these being secured in
the first four innings.
Diedrich at shortstop also played
a good game, handling all his chan
ces without a bobble. He also secured
two hits.
For Park Rapids, Bell and Maas
played good ball.
Scored in First.
Bemidji commenced scoring in the
first inning. With two men on bases
and two out, C. Bailey hit a grounder
to the first baseman who instead of
putting out the man at the base and
retiring the side, tried to cut off the
score at home and threw wild. E.
Bailey then brought in two more
scores by a two-base smash over the
left field fence.
There was no more scoring until
the sixth inning when Bemidji made
five runs on two hits, two bases on
balls and two errors. In this inning
Russell was relieved on the mound
by Williams, a colored player.
Park Rapids threatened to score in
the ninth inning, having two men on
bases, but failed to deliver the neces
sary hits when required.
About 75 fans from Park Rapids
motored to Bemidji to attend the
game.
The attendance at the game was
about 300.

M'GARRY PLEASED
OVER STAND TAKEN
BY C. B, BUCKMAN
Historical Boc*fty
Falls Transcript), Little
Falls, Minn., June 2.P. H. Mc
Garry of Walker, state senator from
the 52d district, was in the city this
morning, coming here expressly for
the purpose of taking up a few mat
ters with C. B. Buckman regarding
the development and reclamation of
lands in Beltrami, Cass and Aitkin
counties if the local man is again
returned to congress. In speaking
of his interview with Mr. Buckman
the Walker man said
"I have been a supporter of Buck
man for some time, but since visiting
him this morning I am more enthu
siastic than ever to have him re
turned to congress. His election will
mean much to the people of the
northern counties. If you will re
member, I introduced a resolution in
the state legislature at the last ses
sion which asked for federal aid in
regulating the waters of the upper
Mississippi and Leech lake. This
resolution was passed, but the na
tional body has taken no active steps
to aid the people of my territory.
With Mr. Buckman in congress we
will be assured of active and not
passive aid. He has given me his
personal pledge to work for federal
aid for the betterment of the roads
in the district and especially will
this be felt in Cass, Beltrami and Ait
kin counties. He has also pledged
himself to work for the better regu
lation and lowering of the waters in
the Mississippi and Leech lake, thus
reclaiming some 300,000 acres of
valuable lands on the tax rolls of the
coupties mentioned above and enab
ling settlers to secure homes at a
small cost. Mr. Buckman's stand
means more than the average person
realizes to the residents of my dis
trict and I feel very elated I can as
sure you to go back home and tell
the people what has been pledged
me." EASTERN STAR TO
HOLD MEET TUESDAY
The Bemidji lodge of the Eastern
Star will hold a regular meeting in
the Masonic Temple Tuesday evening,
June 6. There will be work. Re
freshments will served after which
there will be dancing. The officers
urge a large attendance and request
that all "Stars" be present during
the evening's program.
FORSY eJDRIB MOVIE
AND
REPUBLICANS MAY
UNITE ON HUGHES
Old Guard Makes First Definite Offer
to the Third
Party.
CHICAGO PREPARED
FOR WEEK OF NOISE
Hughes Refuses to Issue Statement
Roosevelt's Power is
Increased.
Chicago, June 5.The Old Guard
today made the first definite offer to
the Progressives. The Republicans
want Hughes and believe that he can
be a winner next fall.
Want Hughes.
They would be willing to put
Hughes at the head of a amalgama
tion ticket. Some of the Old Guard
doubt if Roosevelt could be elected
even on an amalgamated ticket
against Wilson. The Old Guard's
plan is to let the Progressives nomin
ate Hughes early Wednesday. Then
the Republicans will nominate
Hughes Thursday. Thus the Pro
gressives would brag that they forced
the Republicans to accept the same
leader.
LaFollette in Again.
Senator LaFollette of Wisconsin
will be a third-time candidate. He
will be placed in nomination as Wis
consin's favorite son. Four years ago
he had a spectacular pre-convention
fight, broke with Roosevelt and steam
rollered out for Taft.
The Progressive convention sud
denly loomed up big today when it
was learned that Roosevelt was given
the power to veto any Old Guard
candidate.
33 Women Progressives.
Thirty-three women delegates will
be here for the Progressive conven
tion. Twelve come from the^state of
Washington.
A Roosevelt drive on Hughes was
seen today at Oyster Bay in a state
ment by Lucian Bonheur, Progressive
leader, calling upon Hughes for a
statement and asking Hughes to tell
how he stands on various questions.
The statement said that he must
state how he stands or admit that
he is the German-American candidate.
Hughes' secretary at Washington
today announced that no statement
was forthcoming.
John McGrath, Roosevelt's secre
tary, today stated that Roosevelt
would be absent from Chicago dur
ing the convention.
Noisiest Spot.
Chicago started today to make good
on the prediction that for the next
week it will be the noisiest spot in
the worldunless it be Verdun. Cer
tainly it will be the spot where more
words are spilled thany anywhere
else.
All of which is by way of preface
to the fact that the convention
crowds began arriving today. They
came chaperoned by bands, mega
phoned assistants, singers and just
plain noise-makers.
By Wednesday, Chicago will be
swollen with people to nearly twice
its normal size.
There are 985 delegates to the Re
publican national convention, to ar
rive, 985 alternates to the same
nearly 1,000 delegates and alternates
to the Progressive national conven
tion 20,000 women workers for the
ballot, mostly out-of-town boosters
to say nothing of just plain specta
tors to the various affairs.
Lobbies Choked.
Already the lobbies of Chicago's
loop hotels seem as choked with hu
manity as they did at the height of
the Republican convention sessions
four years ago.
All the hotels, incidentally, began
removing furniture from their lob
bies.
No flower pots, vases or chairs will
clutter up space where enthusiasts
may gossip, nor be near at hand for
weapons in case arguments wax too

One well known hotel, which sports
a fountain in the middle of one of its
dining rooms, began today to en
close this spot of water. It is a
