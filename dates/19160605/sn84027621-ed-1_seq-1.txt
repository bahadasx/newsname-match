EVIDENCE ACCUMULATES THAT THE BRITISH WHILE SUFFERII2G DREADFULLY THEMSELVES III
! FLICTED HEAVY PUIIISIU UPOll THEIR EDS
London, June 5. Violent German i
attacks on the Verdun front continued
: last night east of the Meuse without
. success, according to the French war
office. The Germans attacked with
special severity between Dameloup
vilage and Fort Vaux, which the
French claim they still hold. In the
Pouaumont vicinity heavy f artillery
fighting continues. The German raids
in the Vosges failed.
SEYDLITZ SUFFERED AND HAD
TO' SKIP
The German battle cruiser Seydlitz
suffered heavily in the recent naval
engagement, according to reports re
ceived in Denmark. These reports al
leged that the Seydlitz, which is a
dreadnaught cruiser of 25000 tons was
seen the morning after, the "Jutland
engagement steaming south near
Fano island, badly damaged and pur
sued by British warships. British
fleet officers returning . to London
identify the Ilindenburg and Lutzow
as tw.o of the. German warships which
were sunk. , ;
FRENCH REPULSED
Berlin reports the breaking down
of repeated attacks by massed trench
infantry east of the Meuse. The
French lost heavily. ..'..
The Turks in the Caucasus have
driven the Russians back about 25
' miles, according to a Constantinople
official statement. Russian attempts
to cover their retreat or reerain the
' lost positions were repelled by Turk
ish bayonet attacks.
ENGLISH MORE OPTIMISTIC
The British admiralty last night "is
sued a statement saying there was
the strongest grounds for tfie belief
that the British navy in the battle
with the Germans off Jutland last
week had accounted for a total of
eighteen German men-of-war and that
there was nothing to add to or sub
tract from the original announcement
of the British losses. The statement
gave th&'German losses as two battle
ships, tM dreadnaught battle cruis
ers, fo. .ight cruisers, nine torpedo
boat dtj. byers and a submarine. The
pessimrr I which prevailed as a result
of the '. Watty's original statement
of loss' i, .Which now is considered to
have J 'J. needlessly candid and con-
' servj' d in underestimating the ex-ter-if
the German losses as compar
ed.' to those of Great Britain, has been
, -greatly lessened by the later state

MIGHTY NAVY YET CONTROLS
THE SEA BY AN IMMENSE
MARGIN
(Associated Press)
London. June 4. The latest reports
from the British fleet, from neutral
vessels which witnessed parts of the
great naval battle in the North Sea
and from survivors, cause the Brit
ish public to believe that the engage
ment was not so near a defeat as it
first appeared, and in no wise as dis
aster. The British losses, with all
the craft engaged accounted for, were
three battle cruisers, three cruisers
and eight destroyers. .
The German losses are believed to
have been about the same number of
ships, although a much less -aggre
gate of tonnage.
British naval experts maintain that
Great Britain continues to f hold the
supremacy of the sea by a safe marj-
gin and that her enormous navy could
better afford the losses it suffered
;han could the smaller German estab
lishment. The first reports of the
heavy loss of life, unhappily, have not
been revised. Great Britain mourns
for more than 4000 of her best sea
men, and the whole nation is oppress
ed with sadness, which is reflected in
the faces of all the people of London.
There were, 6000 men cn the ships
which sank, and only a few hundred
have been saved. The horrors of mod
ern warfare far exceeding those when
wooden ships fought and continued to
float even when they ceased to be
fighting units, were realized to their
utmost. From five of the largest ships
which went under with a complement
of more than 4000 men, only seven
junior officers and a few seamen were
rescued. ' ' ,
Rear Admiral the Honorable Hor
ace, Lambert Hood, second in com
mand to Vice Admiral Sir David
Beatty, and Captains Sowerby, Cay
and Prowse were lost with many
others. There were no surrenders.
and the ships which Went down car
ried with them virtually their whole
crews. Cnly the Warrior, which was
towed part way from the scene of
battle to a British port, was an ex
ception.
Of some thousand men on the
Queen Mary, only a "corporal's"
guard is accounted for. The same is
true of the Invincible, while there is
no survivors reported from the In
defatigable, the Defense or the Black
Prince.
TOLD THE TRUTH
Secretary Lansing Says that Fatty
Degeneration Threatens the
United States v
Watertown, N. Y., June 4. Secre
tary Lansing, before the Jefferson
County Bar Association here, last
night, scored critics of the adminis
tration's foreign policy.
He said that a neutral right violat
ed by loss of life was far more seri
ous than a neutral " right violated by
the loss of property, and declared that
there were influences in America, and
even in Congress, which put rights of
property and rights of, life on a par.
"This shows," he said, "that the
great heart of the republic is threat
ened with fatty degeneration through
those who have lost their patriotic
vigor." : .'a

SALOON
LEAGUE ESTIMATE
As to the1 Vote Which will be Polled
for Senatorial and Gubernatorial
Candidates Tomorrow
Editor Star: The league has made
careful canvass of the state to
earn who is in first, second and third
place for governor and United States
senator. 18
The eight wet counties of Florida
are supposed to poll nearly 50 per cent
of our vote, and it is quite common for
the liquor interests to vote absolutely
solid, while with prohibitionists ex
actly the opposite is the case. In this
instance we are dividing our ? vote
between three for governor and two
for the Senate.
Now think a moment: Half of the
vote is ours, and we give our candi
dates each 'a third or a t, half of it,
which gives him one-sixth of the total
vote; the liquor men controlling the
other half give it solid to their one
candidate. Where will this put us ?
Should we not select one of our men
and give him the benefit of a solid
vote? Have we not as much common-
sense and sagacity as they ? The
second choice will elect, Be sure to
vote it.
The league is satisfied with Tram-
mell and Bryan, and with Catts,
Knott and Hudson, as to their fidelity
to our cause. We regard them as per
fectly sound on prohibition. The
chances that these: candidates stand
of being elected, as indicated by the
state-wide canvass above referred to,
are as follows:
Trammell, 76 per cent.
Bryan, 24 per cent.
Knott, 53 per cent.
Catts, 36 per cent.
Hudson, 11 per cent. ' . ,
These figures show the status of
all the candidates, except that Farris
and Gilchrist-Wall are sure to receive
a strong liquor vote that our league
cannot hear from. Only our friends
and those more or less neutral will
talk frankly to us. Farris will contest
first place with our high man for
governor and Wall-Gilchrist will do
the same for the Senate! They will
select one man y to .'concentrate on at
the last moment. Sincerely.

Jersey Man Who Will Greatly
Add to It
The Florida Utilities company, a
newly organized corporation, has pur
chased the Ocala Gas company, will

ing at once about five miles, of new
mains. Mr. C. W. Hunter will con
tinue as manager for the present at

j Mr. J. Leffert Conard, of Trenton.
J., president of the new company,
is in the city, and when ' seen thi3
morning said that about $28,000, and
possibly more, will be spent in im
proving the present gas plant and in
creasing the mains. The Florida
Utilities company, according to Mr.
Conard, was organized for the pur

plants, and at present has a plant at
West Palm Beach and another in
Rome, Ga. Interested with Mr. Con
ard in the company is Mr. William M.

wealthy men of that city interested in
the pottery industry. They believe
that there is a good opening in Ocala.
Most of the new gas mains will be
laid in Linwood Park, in the south
eastern and the southwestern sections
of the city.
Speaking of the pottery industry,
Mr. Conard said that he thought that
Florida kaolin would be used more ex
tensively, and .that - investigations
were being made looking to the use
of the clays of this state. He pointed
out that the war had made it neces
sary to seek clays at home.

Marshal Carter says that the new

not a great deal.
It appears that the ordinance does

around the courthouse square, but re
quire's only those vehicles that are for
hire to park there. On Fort King
avenue, between Main street and Wa
tula streets, all vehicles must park
on the north side of the street only,

Republicans Believe They Can
Win With the Jurist
BELIEVE THAT HE
UHITE
L VOTE
(Associated
Chicago, June 5. The movement to
nominate Justice Hughes in the re
publican national convention here this
week -has assumed' the aspects of a
genuine boom. Arriving delegations
have evinced a sentiment for the
jurist's nomination. Men who have
been identified with the republican
old guard declared numbers of dele
gates instructed for other candidates
were ready to turn their votes to Jus
tice Hughes' after the first ballot. The
lack of a controlling leadership by the
old guard element is emphasized on
every hand. They express themselves
as not favoring Hughes for any rea
son of personality, but because first
hand reports indicate that he is the
man to harmonize sentiment and re
habilitate the party, bringing in the
progressive strength.
Explanations for the failure of the
expected sentiment for Roosevelt to
crystallize are sought on every hand.
A week ago many opponents feared a
stampede to Roosevelt, but this is
now said to be improbable. Republi
can leaders, after Va canvass today,
declared Roosevelt's strength would
not be over 200 delegates. They be
lieve the number will be nearer one
hundred and fifty. ' It is asserted that
the remainder wouldn't vote for Col.
Roosevelt under any circumstances.
; The talk of demanding a precon
vention statement from Hughes has
been practically abandoned. It is gen
erally agreed that Justice Hughes will
continue to remain silent while on the
supreme bench, but if he should be.
the nominee, will immediately make a
statement of-his' position of national
questions. His supporters point to his
speeches made at different times be
fore he went on the bench, claiming
that sentiments expressed- by him
then show he is for preparedness.
Everywhere there seems to be a!
sentiment to avoid making the nomi-i
nee a Campaign issue and to select
some one on whom the republicans
and progressives can agree. j

.MEAT LINES FORMED
IN GERMAN CITIES
Berlin,' May 16. (Corespondence of
the Associated Press) For the first
time since the outbreak of the war
meat is hard to obtain in the capital
and larger cities of the German em
pire. "Meat lines" have grown as long
as the "butter and milk lines," and
those forming them must sometimes
wait for hours before they can pro
cure the quota allotted by their cards.
Responsible for this condition are
the heavy demands of the army upon
the meat supply, an almost total ces
sation of imports, and the govern
ment's new policy of discouraging the
slaughtering of meat animals Deiore
fattening has given them their maxi
mum butcher weight. Cattle owners
have recently show a tendency to
keep stock from the market because
the maximum price arrangement has
left them little profit.
