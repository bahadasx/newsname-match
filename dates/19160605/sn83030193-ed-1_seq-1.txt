LONDON, June 5. British officers of the fleet which participated
In the Jutland battle who have returned here identify two German battle
ships sunk as the Hindenburg and the LuUow.
The Admiralty stated last night that the Germans had suffered heav
ier losses than were first reported, but did not mention the names of the
additional big ships that had been sunk.
COPIJNHAGKN. Denmark. June 5
(via London). Tho Stlfts-Tldendc of
Aalborg, which yesterday published a
report thnt the 2."i,000-ton derman but
tlo cruiser Seydlitz was sighted on
Thursday off l'aro Island, pursued by
British warships and badly damaged,
says It Is now believed the Seydlitz
was sunk.
A despatch to this newspaper from
Rlbc, Jutland, reports that persona
living in Schlcswig have received
word that relatives on board tho
Seydlitz were l;llted.
I1EHL1N. June 5 (Ily wireless to
the Associated Press from a stall'
correspondent, via Snyvlllct. An au
thoritative account of the North Sea
battle which was Issued here to-day
gives the first detailed picture f the
imum ui niv hinu )
tween the Herman high sea Meet and
that of the llritlsh. Many details of
the engagement were suppressed for
tratcgle reasons, leaving uiimitiMI) d j
for tho present the (ierman public's
thirst for Intel estlng touclies In re
gard to the Indlvldiiul achievements
of the (icrman warships and the
manner in which the mighty llritlsh
vessels were sent to the bottom. Tr i
recital meets clearly what Is char
acterized as the. llrltish attempt to
explain defeat by the statement that
toe. German sea forces in the action
were much larger th i those which
the llritlsh went ablo to bilng Into
play.
This account, as Riven out to-day,
dccluros explicitly that twoiity-sK
of Admiral Jelllcoo's most powerful
battleships, Including Mx of the most
modem Queen Kli.uboth class, and Hid
cntlio llritlsh Plying Wing, com
posed of battle cruisers eiiiil in
ovcry icspccl, except armor protec
tion, to dreadnoughts, weio engaged
In all but the early stages 0f the day
battle. Thu lleet thus assembled
surpassed In tonnage and weight ol
broadsides tho Herman forcu en
gaged, was at least equally modern
and was far speedier than the squad
ron of Clcnnan pro-dreadnoughts
which, lumbering along at IS or l'J
knots, wore soon left lar to tho rear
by their swifter consorts, out of tho
main action.
J"or obvious reasons the recital
leaves untold tho tale of damages sus
tained by Herman units ami the
losses In personnel. It says nothing
of tho brilliancy In battle tactics dis
played by Admirals checr ami Hip
per, tho smoothness and precision
with which tho Herman ships ma
noeuvred ami tho deadly surenoss of
the Gorman marksmanship, although
It Is an open secret th.it these three
factors wero largi ly responsible for
tho achievements of tho Hermans.

Says Bnildiii"; of Subway Was
Profitable Investment, Oper
ating It Was Not.
August Ilelmont, banker, builder of
the first subway and eminent turf
man, appeared before the Thompson
committee to-day and marie, a stale
ment, which related chiefly to his
selling the City Island and tbo New
York and Pelh.im Uallroud Companies
to the Interborough Company In 1902.
He quoted opinions of tho Supreme
Court to show that he was Justified
In selling these companies, which ho
had bought for $271,000. to the Inter
borough Company for 15,000 shares of
Its stock, worth $1,. "00,000 at par, for
the following reasons:
1. The companies' charters were
lndlpensabe. for under tho law ns it
then stood there was no other way
by which the new subway could lie
run.
;. The payment of 13,000 shares
also covered tho fees due A. Helmont
& Co. for financing tho building of
the subway.
These nro the railroad companies
which were characterized nt earlier
sessions of tho Thompson Commlttco
as "eight mule railroads," Tho Im
plleitlon was that they wero almost
worthless. In the complaint of the
Continental Securities Company,
whnse action allocking the sale was
defeated In the Suptemo Court. It
was charged that the railroads were
actually worth less than $10,000,
When .Mr. Helmont took tho wit
ness rbalr Counsel Moss asked htm
If he had a statement to make. Ho
said ho.expected to tell about the City
Island road which was acquired by
the Interborough shortly bofore the
dual contract was entered Into.
Q. You helped to crcato the Inter
borough Company?
Mr. Helmont nodded.
Q. And you wero In the original
Subway Construction Company?
A. Yes, That was organized for tho
purpose of building the tlrst subway
and taking over John II. McDonuld's
contract. Ho had norther capital nor
sureties, tho latter having disappoint
ed him. So the construction company
had to keep its relation with Mr.
McDonald so separate that It could
go on his bond. He remained legally
the contractor and mario the pay
ments to the company as the pay.
ments wero mado to him.
Q. Well, tho fact was that the con
struction company bonded Itself? A.
That's what Judge Van Hrunt said,
though It was not exactly tho legal
fact.
"I understand," said Senator
Thompson, "that there were certain
powerful financial Interests In this
city opposed to tho building of the
subway, and Mr. Helmont built It
anyway."
"They had no prejudice against the
subway," said Mr. Helmont. "Their
hostility was based simply on busi
ness reasons. It was perfect!) Jus
tified. They bad hail a most careful

Although tho proprietors of 40;i cloak

duty. Karly tills morning 15,000
pickets from th International Indies'

Fifth Avenue from Sixteenth Street
to Thirty-fourth Street und prevented
any one from entering the shops con
trolled by tho Manufacturers' Asso

ets wero on duty all night, tho manu
facturers succeeded In gathering about
300 men In tho shops. They expected
at least 5,000.
When It was seen that large crowds
of strikers were gathering along Fifth
Avenue, more than 300 pluln clothes
men ivcm rushed to tho district. No
nrre.sts wero made and no disorder
was reported.
Ilenjamln Schleslnger, President of

CHICAGO, June 5. All political lines remained unchanged to-day,
with every candidate and every faction standing defiantly in the same
position it occupied yesterday and (lie day before.
An all night of fighting through hotel corridors and in conference
rooms took on similarity to Verdun operations, with political assaults,
charges, poisonous gaies and hand grenades.
The Oyster Hay telephone wire hummed for two hours this morn
ing, bringing orders lo brace lines and stop all wavering. When the
Progressive National Committee met at ll o'clock, George Perkins and
William Hamlin Childs delivered the orders.
The Committee at once decided to withhold the nominating of a
candidate in the Progressive Convention until next Saturday, waiting the
action of the Republican Oiiivention.
This decision Indicated that tho plan"
of the radicals to nominate Itooso
velt and then sit tight had been over
come by tho Perkins faction. In somo
(ilarters It wa.s declared tho move
meant that hope of inducing tho Ito
ptihlli'iins lo nominate the t'olouel had
been abandoned, and that from now
