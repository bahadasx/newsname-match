Old Guard is in Control of the Situation,
[By perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
CHICAGO, June 6.—The old guard
made it* Urst definite proffer to the
progressives today. Secure In its
own belief that it can control the
votes of a majority of the dele
gates, the dominant forces of repub
licanism want Hughes. But they
only want Hughes if they can be con
vinced he can be a winner next No*
•ember. Therefore their preliminary
feeler to the progressives was to as
certain whether an agreement could
Hot be possible with Hughes as a
candidate, running on any sort of a
platform which the progressives
The old guard Isn't^Htttling the
power which it feels the progres
sives can swing and Its plan went
further than a mere suggestion that
agreement come about on Hughes, it
went so far as to embrace a scheme
by which the progressives might be
able later to say they were the ones
who put Hughes over. The scheme
fostered by the old guard was to
have the progressives meet Wednes
day and not later than Thursday
night to nominate Hughes. Then by
Friday or Saturday the republican
convention would choose the same
standard bearer. The progressives
could very well point w'th pride to
the fact that by their action in nam
ing Hughes they had forced the G.
O. P. into selecting the same leader.
The progressive leaders who have
been waiting some sort of an olive
branch suggestion, made it known to
day they were first for" Roosevelt—
and only for Hughes if some sort of
a "satisfactory" statement of prin
ciples could be extracted from th«
Justice. Falling in that, they flaunt
ed the big stick of a third ticket
There appeared very little doubt
today that Hughes can be nominated
if the Big Three—'Penrose, Barnes
and Crane—says so. But the big
three does not want to say so until
they can be assurred of a united par
ty behind Hughes. They do not
think Roosevelt can possibly draw all
the votes of a reunited party. They
do not think any of the favorite
sons are well enough known national
ly or are of sufficient potency to de
feat Wilson, without progressive
support. In other words the old
guard was in the position of having
control, but not knowing what to da
with the control.
One counter suggestion advanced
by the uncompromising progressive
group was for the republicans to go
ahead and nominate Hughes ahd the

Practically' a if leaders—republican

hope of penetrating Justice Hughes'
silence before the balloting comes in
the G. O. P. meeting. The allies'
hope of defeating him in the ballot
ing, comes through a belief that If
the roll calls can be prolonged
through half a dozen or more times,
the justice might formally withdraw.
