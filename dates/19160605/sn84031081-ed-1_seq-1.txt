Chicago, Juno 4. The progressive

Respite increasing demands by
Kooseveit supporters today for the
personal attendance here hy Colonel
Kooseveit, his secretary, John VV. Mc
Urath, declared positively tonight that
the colonel would remain at Oyster
Day during the convention.
Two .Statements IsmiciI,
Two progressive national commit
teemen, Harold U Ickes, of Illinois,
and William I iolton Dye, of Indiana,
tonight issued statements.
"Certainly the progressives will not
nominate Justice Hughes without
knowing his position on the vital is
sued of the day," said Mr. Ickes. ' The
possibility of a joint nomination of
Justice Hughes by republicans and
progressives Is therefore n remote con
tingency. On the face of the present
situation Justice. Hughes is plainly
impossible of consideration for the
progressive nomination."
Declaring that Indiana progressives
are for Mr. Roosevelt, "or someone
just as good, a man in whom they
have Implicit confidence," mild -Mr.
I'p, "the progressivea are willing to
lay aside their party emblem or some
of the things they have fought for to
accomplish, a success of their broader
patriotic movement."
Exchange Courtesies.
Mutual Interest of progressives and
republicans of Oregon was evidenced
ty exchange of seats between the rival
tMcttates and alternates. The Oregon
republicans, who arrived today, have
appointed five progressives as their
alternates in the republican conven
tion hall. The progressives from Ore
Ron have returned the courtesy by ap
pointing five of the regular republi-
cans us their alternates in the progrcs- I
Kive meeting.

Monday, progressive delegations In
force will arrive from New York,
I'emisylvaniu, Kansas, North Dakota,
Georgia, and South Carolina. Among
the progressive lenders who arrived
today was William Flinn, of Pitts
burgh. Hwwn May Hp Chairman.
It was said here tonight that Wal
ter P.rown, of Ohio, would probably

The plan suggested last week by
George W. Perkins, of New York, that

that the Justice can win the nomina

The situulion wlileli this condition
presents is unprecedented. None of
the leaders on the ground professes
to have any idea of what will happen.
H is notable that all the speculation
so far has been principally among the
leaders, probably less than fifty of
them, and that the delegates have had
very little part in ii. Little more
lha.ii half of the delegates to the re
publican convention had reached Chi
cago tonight. Those who are here
are uncertain of the altitude of other
men from their states.

Roosevelt could have the progressive
nomination at oneo if he would say

known what the republicans purposed
to do.
on every hand tonight there Is a'polnte
speculation as to what the old guard !,,,
will do if it succeeds in defeating
Colonel Roosevelt for the nomination;
whether they would go the whole dis
tance mid nominate a man of their
number such as Root, Fairbanks,
Weeks or llurton; or whether they
would attempt to conciliate the pro
gressives by choosing a man whom
Ihe latler might support. The name
l(f Justice
ughes is the only one
that has been brought forward so tar
as having such possibilities.
Harmony Prevails.
Among the rank and file of the re
publicans there arc indications of a
genuine effort to draw the progres
sives back into the old party. One of
these evidences is the2 lack of harsh
criticism and bellicose demonstrations
which characterized the convention
period of IMS. Apparently all fac
tions learned a lesson from the dis
iistioiiM eonscriiiences following the
'split four years ago and us a result
nothing is heard In the nature oi
braggadocclo or defiance.
Hecause of the fact that Justice
Hughes and Colonel Roosevelt occupy
daces far in advance of others in the ;
race, they have become the especial
subjects of attack, each bv the cham
pnninns of the other, and both by the
adherents of Ihe half dozen or more
other men whose names are being
mentioned.
Colonel Grvully OpKiscd.
Most of the delegates who came In
toduy were ot the element that stood
out for party solidarity in 112 and
although some of them speak with
out rancor of Colonel Roosevelt, they
take a positive position against his
candidacy. While they contend that
his nomination is impossible they
ngrpe that the Influence of his sup
porters may lie paramount In naming
the ecandbiate and shaping the plat
form. Many of I hem are willing to
concede that Inasmuch as their first
desire Is a united party, they are will
ing to go to the sacrifice of letting
Colonel Roosevelt pick the candidate
if that will Insure hurmony among
the republicans und win the suppori
of the progressives.
Those who are opposing nominal-
ling Justice Hughes lay their principal
complaint against him to his failure
to announce his position on curretil
issues. This criticism comes from
both republicans and progressives.
There was n widespread report to
night thai Colonel Roosevelt himself
had declared that he would not sup
port the liisliee unless he made such n
statement. The progressive leaders
here made no secret of their Intention
lo demand n satisfactory pronounce
ment before they would give their
support.
Hughes Would Aiccpl.
Supporters of Hughes contended
that if he was nominated by tho re
publicans lie could bo depended upon
lo send u telegram "f acceptance that
would meet with the approval of del
egates. Even pome of the progres
sives agreed that they could not hope
for an advanced statement from Mr.
Hughe In Mew of the fact that he
never has admitted that he was n
candidate. Some of them wenl so
far as lo say that If he was nominat
ed by the republicans and immedi
