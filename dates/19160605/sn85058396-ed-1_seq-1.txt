Din of Battle Stunning, Stu
pendous, Deafening Many
Sad Incidents Occur.
Edinburgh, June 5, 5.09 a. m. Sur
vivors arriving here from British de
stroyers which made a massed attack
on a German battleship in the Jutland
battle were convinced that they sent
to the bottom the dreadnought Hin
denburg, tho piide of the German
navy.
These sailors say that the Ilinden-
ourg was strucK successively Dy iour
torpedoes while the destroyers dashed
in alongside of her hull tearing her
to pieces until the mighty ship reeled
and sank.
An officer from one of the destroy
ers gave the following graphic ac
count of the battle:
Officer's Graphic Story.
"The ships of the grand fleet went
into action as if they were going into
maneuvers. From every yard arm
the white ensign flew, the flag which
is to the sailor as the tattered colors
were in days of old to a hard pressed
regiment. That It went hard with the
battle cruisers Is apparent, but one
ship cannot fight a dozen. They had
fought a great fight, a fight to be
proud of, a fight which will live long
er than many a victory-
"We fought close into the foe and
if anything is certain In the uncer
tainties of a naval battle it is that
we gave at least as good as we got.
We passed along the line of German
ships some miles away and let off
broad side after broadside. The- air
was heavy with masses of smoke, j
black, yellow, green and every other
color. The enemy ships were firlne;
very fast but watching the ships in
front one came to tho conclusion that
the shooting was decidedly'' erratic.
Again and again salvos of shells fell
far short of Ihe mark to be followed
immediately by others which scream
ed past high in the air.
Iron Duke's Broadsides.
"I watched the Iron Duke swinging
through the seas letting off broadside
after broadside, wicked tongues of
flames leaping through clouds of
smoke. The din of battle was stun
ning, stupendous, deafening, as hun
dreds of the heaviest guns In the
world roared out at once. Great mas
ses of water rose In the air like water-,
spouts, reaching as high as tho masts
as the salvoes of German shells fell
short or went over their target
Smoke Obscures Everything.
"It was impossible to see what was
happening among the ships of the foe.
The smoko obscured everything so
effectually that one could only get a
glimpse at Intervals when a kindly
' wind blew a lane through the pall.
It was apparent that the best ships
of the enemy were engaged but how
many neither eye nor glass could
mako out. The number was certainly
large. It was equally Impossible to
see what damage we were causing.
Only the high command knew the
progress of the battle. That the dam
age inflicted on the German ships
was great does not admit of any doubt.
At ono time two vessels red with flre
gleamed through the smoko.
"It Is a curious feeling to bo in the
midst of a battle and not to know to
which side fortune leans. Where only
a few ships are engaged it is differ
ent. Our own losses were known
with some degree of exactness, but
even that was uncertain. Thus at
one time it was thought that the Lion
had been loBt as she did not answer
any call. Jt transpireu max. ner wire
less had been destroyed.
"With the dusk came the great op
portunity of the mosquito craft and
both sides made use of it to the full.
It was in this way that one of tho
saddest of many sad incidents occur
red. A destroyer, true to its name,
dashed for the big enemy. She soon
got into effective range and loosed her
torpedo, and, with deadly effect, on a
German battleship. The ship went
down and the destroyer raced 'for safe
ty, the commander and officers stand
ing on the bridge indulging in mutual
congratulations at their success. At
that moment, a shell hit tho bridge,
and wiped out the entire group.
"It was curious to note the effoct
of the fight on the sea. Calm at the
beginning the water soon looked as
If it were under the influence of a
gale so great was the turmoil caused
by the leviathan ships, plowing at ter
rific speed through the waves. The
sea also seemed to bo stiff with fish
killed by the shells bursting in the
water."

BERLIN STORY
OF SEA FIGH1
Admiral Jellicoe's Most Pow
erful Battleships and Entire
Flying Wing Were
Engaged.
BRITISH DEFEAT
Germans Far Superior in Ra
pidity of Fire Were Able to
Shower Enemy With
Shots.
Berlin, June 5. Wireless to Asso
ciated Press from staff correspondent
via Sayville. Twenty-six of Admiral
Jellicoe's most powerful battleships,
Including six of the most modern
Queen Elizabeth class, and the entire
British flying wing, composed of bat
tle cruisers, equal in every respect
except armor protection, to dread
noughts, were engaged in all save the
early stageB of the day battle in the
North sea, according to an authorita
tive account. The account meets clear
ly what Is characterized as the Brit
ish attempt to explain defeat by the
statement that the German forces in
action were much larger than the
British. Many details however, are
suppressed for strategic reasons.
Tho fleet thus assembled, says the
account, surpassed the tonnage and
weight of broadsides of the German
force engaged, was at least equally
modern, and was far speedier than
the squadron of German pre-dread-noughts,
which, lumbering along at IS
or 10 knots were soon left far to the
rear by their swifter consorts, out of
tho main action.
Brilliant Battle Tactics.
The recital leaves until the tale of
damages sustained. bn German units
fand the losses in personnel. It says
nothing of the brilliancy in battle tac-l
tics displayed by Admirals Scheer and
Hipper the smoothness and precision
with which the German ships man
euvered and the deadly sureness of the
German marksmanship, although it is
an open secret that these three fac
tors were largely responsible for tho
achievements of the Germans.
tl is shown that the Germans, on
this occasion, unlike the Doggerbank
engagement of cruiser squadrons, were
unable to choose their distance and
fought considerable portions of the
battle at ranges of about eight miles
now ranked as a moderate distance
at which the German 11 and 12-lnch
guns were virtually as effective in
penetrntlng power as the big mouthed
13's, 14 'b and 15's with which tho
, modern British giants are armed.
Furthermore, they are far superior in
rapidity of fire. Naval experts have
intimated to The Associated Press
that this was one of the most decisive
factors in the struggle.
British Showered With Shells.
German battleships and battle cruis
ers were able to shower the British
with a hail of shell, which at a range
of eight miles and sometimes even
closer, smashed and riddled British
armor belts and wrought havoc to
ships' vitals The ponderous British
projectiles naturally were no less ef
fective but tho Armstrong and White
worth monsters could land scarcely
one punch to each two from the
vicious Krupp 11-inchers.
The hazy weather was Germany's
friend as it necessitated action at
closer range.

! PROGRESSIVES TO
WITHHOLDACTION
Will Not Nominate Candidate
Until Saturday Awaiting
Action of Republicans.
Chicago, June 5. The Progressive
national committee decided to with
hold nominating a candidate in the
Progressive convention until next Sat
urday, awaiting the action of the Re
publican convention.
The decision of the Progressive
committee followed a speech by Chair
man Murdock in which he declared he
was for Colonel Roosevelt's nomina
tion and would not be "for any non
commltal candidate at this time."
The national committee appointed
a "steering committee" with broad
general powers to treat with Republi
can leaders and also carry on a news
paper publicity campaign. The com
mittee consists of George W. Perkins
of New York, Governor Hiram John
son of California, and Horace Wilkin
son of New York.
The executive commltteo of which
Mr. Perkins is chairman presented
the plan which was adopted by the
national commltteo to delay action
upon nominating a candidate until
Saturday. It was decided to warn all
delegates against leaving Chicago.
The "steering committee," it was
stated by Progressive leaders will
have discretion to treat with Republl
can leaders or a similar committee
from the Republican committee or con.
vention regarding possible joint action
on a nominee.
The position of the Progressives re
garding the candidacy of Colonel
Roosevelt and its reception by tho Re
publicans was outlined after the Pro
gressive meeting today by William
Allen White, committeeman from
Kansas as follows-
"Wo take the posIUon that we are
unanimous on one first choice candi
date and only one Colonel Roose
velt. If the Republicans can't agree
upon Colonel Roosevelt we expect
them to come to us and we will then
be able to tell them our second choice.
But In the meantime we ate standing
upon our first choice."
The national committee adopted a
motion by Mr. Perkins appointing
Dean Lewis of tho University of Penn
sylvania to make a preliminary draft
of tho Progressive platform.
Led by Chairman Murdock, various
committeemen Bpoke in favor of keep
ingfthe Progressive party as a distinct
political entity, even should the Re
publicans endorse tho Progressive
nominee.
"I am not a Republican nnd didn't
intend to be," Mr. Murdock was
quoted as declaring.
In addiUon to outlining the general
plan of campaign, the committee ap
proved tho credentials of delegates
and alternates submitted by state
chairmen and ordered tho temporary
roll printed. There were no contests.

GERMANS LOSE EIGHTEEN SHIPS I
. IN BATTLE AND BRITISH FOURTEEN I
Result of Great Sea Fight Now Claimed as British Victorjr I M
Pride of German Navy Sent to Bottom Teutonic Ships
Badly Damaged Great Britain Still in Control ,of , M
High Seas and German Ambition to Break M
Blockade Destroyed Naval Situation M
Practically Unchanged. M
iH
London Juno 5. 12 noon In view
of the latest report of the admiralty
on the naval battle of last week, tho
press and public are devoting their
attention to computing the losses of
the two navies and the effect the en
gagement is likely to have on future
naval warfare. The British estimate
of eighteen German ships lost as com
pared with fourteen BriUsh Is accept
ed by the majority and the result is
now claimed as a complete, victory for
the British 'fleet.
So far as the German denial of the
British claim is concerned, it is point
ed out that the Germans did not ad
mit the loss of the cruiser Elbing until
the arrival of some survivors from her
in Holland and this Is cited as con
firmation that the Germans conceal
their losses until forced by circum
stances to reveal them. This is made
possible, it is argued, by the fact that
the British losses occurred In daylight
and arc known to the Germans while
the German losses took place In twi
light or after dark.
Should the British estimate of tho
German losses prove correct, naval
writers say it will be many a long
day before the German fleet shows
itself again In the North sea, and even
should the estimate prove excessive,
the damage done to the German bat
tle cruisers will put an end to raids
on English coasts. After the Dogger
bank battle, the Derfflinger and
Moltke were five months In dock and
it is believed that the German ships
of this clas3 engaged In last week's
battle were even more severely dam-
aed- . J'
The Derfflinger and her sister ship.
the Lutzow, are believed to be the
battle cruisers which the British have
included in the list of supposed Ger
I man losses while another battle cruis
i er, the Seydlitz, is reported from a
neutral source to have been seen on
, Thursday morning badly damaged and
1 being pursued by British warships.
I Cannot Force Blockade.
The battle, it is also suggested, puts
an end to, the German ambition of
forcing a way through tho British
blockade to raid allied shipping in
the Atlantic. Germany, it is argued,
now has not the ships suitable for
this undertaking.
Another advantage claimed from tho
outcome of the battle Is that It re
lieves the pressure on the Russian
army will In Courland to which the
German fleet was giving valuable sup
porL It is already reported from Cop
enhagen that German cruisers have
been withdrawn from the Courland
coast, while German destroyers have
not been seen for a week In the south
ern Baltic.
London, June 5, 3:30 p. m. The
latest reports received by the British
admiralty enabled the .Associated
Press to give the following review
of tho naval engagement off the Jut
land coast as viewed from the British
side.
The British fleet remained in pos
session of the scene of battle during
the morning of June 1 and traversed
the field four times, finding no en
emy to fire upon. Tho commander-in-chief
took his fleet back to its base
at his leisure and five hours after
its arrival reported the battle fleet
ready for action.
As regards the German losses def
inite evidence, It Is declared, has now
been obtained that they were deliber
ately falsified and that tho following
were destroyed:
Two battle cruisers; one at least,
and probably two battleships; four
light cruisers, eight destroyers and
oue submarine.
All Ships Severely Damaged.
The remainder of the German battle
cruiser squadron may have reached
homo ports but the ships were all se
verely damaged, as also were ships
of the Koenig class which came under
tho fire of a portion of tho Brttish
battle fleet
Besides the above, the Associated
Press has obtained information from
returned officers of the fleet that they
were able to Identify the lost Ger
man battle cruisers as the' Hinden
burg and the Lutzow.
