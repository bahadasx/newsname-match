The British officers of the

Confident Hindenburg Sunk
Edinburg, June 5 Survi
from the British de
stroyers which were engaged
in the Jutland battle are con
vinced that they sunk the Ger
man dreadnaught Ilindenburg,
which was the pride of the Ger
man navy. They say the Ilin
denburg was struck successive
ly by four torpedoes.
According to a story of the naval
battle received here, the German fleet
engaged in the Jutland battle num
bered 100 vessels, Including at least
twenty battleships and battle cruisers.
Apart from the fact that the Ger
mans were three times as strong as
the squadron of Admiral Beatty, the
German fleet had the advantage of
light and adopted their favorite tac
tics of hugging the coast, at the same
time assuring them a safe retreat. The
fight was mainly a battle of big guns.
As the big ships came up the range
was rapidly reduced from fifteen to
ten miles, and finally to five. By this
time the battle was virtually an in
ferno as the opposing squadrons
rained broadsides upon one another.
Chasing German Cruiser.
Copenhagen, June 5 dispatch re
ceived here this morning from Ribe,
Jutland, says the German battle cruis
er Seydlitz was sighted Thursday,
thirty-nine miles off Faroe Islands,
going south pursued by British war
ships. The Seydlitz was badly dam-
ager, and had two large noies upon.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE NEGO
TIATING FOR JONES PROPERTY
ON BROADWAY, WHERE TABER
NACLE STANDS.
There U a movement on foot by
the Chamber of Commerce to pur
chase the Arthur Jones lot on hc
corner of Broadway and C streets
north west, where the tabernacle now
stands, and if their negotiations are
successful in all probability Ar.lmern
will have a large auditorium erected,
which the city is badly In need of.
Ardmore has missed many conven
tions for the reason that there is no
adequate 'place in which to hold largj
meetings. The Chamber of Commerce
has long realized this, and now that
they have a chance to secure some
valuable property at a reasonable
price, are inclined to take the matter
up and put it through.
The lot in question faces 163 feet
on Broadway and 143 feet on C
street, and is amply large for the
irpd. The deal will in-
i'1 -
volve approximately $11,000. A com
mittee has been appointed to confer
with Mr. Jones, who is in the. cit
from Phoenix, Ariz., and something
definite will be done today.
Kansas Grain Damaged.
A letter to The Ardmoreite from
E. C. Britton at Arkansas City, Kans.,
says that the green bugs have done
much damage to the wheat and oats
in that rection.
TO
YOUNG'S LAKE NEAR BERWYN TO
BE THE SCENE, AND THE OC
CASION IS LOOKED FORWARD
TO WITH KEEN INTEREST.
Some time the latter part of this
month all the candidates for office in
Carter county, and their name is le
gion, will have a big basket picnic
at G. W. Young's lake, situated a few
miles from the town of Berwyn. This
is one of the best stocked lakes in
the country and it will be no trouble
to catch fish enough for all the can
didates and their friends to enjoy a
fish fry.
Mr. Young, county commissioner
from that district stated this morning
that he would have everything in
shape to make the announcement of
the date In a few days, and expected
every candidate in the connty to be
on hand and let the people know
what they stood for. Thirty-five candi
dates have so far announced and ev
ery one seen so far has signified his
Intention of being there and enjoying
the hospitality of "Uncle Bud."

IT'S DIFFERENT
ARDMORE PEOPLE CAN RELIEVE
CONGESTION AND GET BETTER
SERVICE BY BEING MORE
PROMPT.
The people of Ardmore who have
occasion to leave over the railway
trains are reminded that they are
living in a different city from what
they lived in one year ago. We
have been accustomed to going to
the station about ten or fifteen min
utes ahead of train time and getting
tickets, checking baggage leisurely
and then have plenty of time. But
things are different now. The sta
tions are so badly crowded just be
fore tr.iin time that (he trucks cannot
be moved. Especially is this so at
the Santa Ke station, where a make
shift of a depot building is still
being used. Agent Herndon cannot
meet the demands of the people as
they are coming now. All want tick-
ets
the
and all want baggage checked at
same time, and there is a con
gested condition that prevents the
giving of good service. Those who
know they are going "away can get
good service and confer a big favor
upon Aent Herndon by buying tick
ets and checking baggage in advance.
Remember that you aro living in a
different town.

MOVEMENT FOR HIS NOMI
NATION BY REPUBLICANS TOOK
ON NATURE OF BOOM TODAY.
AFTER FIRST BILLOT
Many Delegates Instructed for Others
Said to be Ready to Throw Their
Votes to Hughes After the First
Ballot.
Chicago, III.. June 5. The move
ment for the nomination of Jus
tice Hughes as the republican stan
dard bearer, took on the aspects of
a genuine boom today.
Men identified with the "old guard"
of the republican party declared that
many of the delegates instructed for
others are ready to turn their votes
to Hughes after the first ballot.
The delegates express themselves
as not favoring Hughes for any rea-
scn of personality, but because they
believe he can bring harmony to
the republican party.
On every hand reasons are sought
for the failure of the Roosevelt sen
timent to crystallize.
Settle Texas Contest.
Chicago, III., June 5. Settlement ot
the contests of the Texas delegations
to the republican national convention

and the amount that fell was suffic
ient for all requirements. Growing
conditions are very good at this time.

CANDIDATES OUT IN FORCE TO
ASK THE DEAR PEOPLE FOR'
THEIR SUFFRAGE IN THE COM
ING ELECTION.
The eagle got up and uttered some
lusty screams Saturday night when
a majority of the candidates for
county offices opened the campaign at
Newport under the usual auspices that
have characterized all campaigns
since statehood. Uncle Jim Avery,
dean of the democratic forces of Car
ter county acted In his usual capacity
as master of ceremonies and Introduc
ed the speakers as their turns came
upol the program.
On account of the large number of
candidates present it was necessary
to restrict their remarks to a few mo
ments, merely giving them long
enough to announce themselves for
the office to which they aspired, and
even at that it was extremely late
w hen the last one had told the people
assembled who remained to the last,
what he stood for.
The candidates acquitted themselves
creditably and every one present went
away convinced that the coming race
is already won by themselves, though
or course, a lot of them will find they
are niiskvn after the ballots have
been counted.
The good people of Newport pre
pared sumptuous repasts in many of
their homes for the visiting candi
dates, that was enjoyed by many a
hungry one, and when they departed
they gave assurance to the people
that the campaigns in Carter county
would always be opened with them.
It is impossible to give a detailed
account of each of the candidates'
statement to the people, but all of
them made a good Impression and
confined their remarks to announc
ing themselves to the office to which
they aspired and asked the support
of the people.
