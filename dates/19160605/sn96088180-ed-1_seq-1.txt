CHICAGO
Old Guard Ready to Name
the Jurist if Assurance Is
Forthcoming That He iWill
Carry Support, 'of the Party
Chicago, J una 5.-Th "old guard"
mad Its Bret definite proffer to the
progressives today. Secure la Hi own
belief thut It can control the voles of
majority of th delegates, th dom
inant forces of republicanism want
Hughes. Hut they only want If tight
ft they can be convinced he ran bo
winner. Therefore, tbo preliminary
feeler to the progressives waa to a
eertaln If an agreement would not be
possible with Hughs aa a eandMate,
mnniif on any sort of a platform
which the progressives unlght require.
The old guard la not belittling the
power which It feel the progressives
cm wing, and Ita plan went further
than a mere aimgentlon that an agree
nent committee discuss Hughei. It
went no far aa to dlacuaa a acheme ty
which the progressives might later
aalit In putting Hughei over. ,
The acheme waa to suggest that
... ft.! Progressive meet , $?nfy tsday
and not later than Thursday njght to
nominal Hughei. Then by Friday
or Saturday the republican conven
tlon would rhooee the aame standard
bearer. The progressives could
wary well polnt with pride" to the
fact that by their action In naming
ITnghea they had forced the 0. 0. P.
Into aeleotlng the aame leader.
The progreaelve leaden, who hare
been waiting aome aort of an ollre
branch anggeatlon, made It known
today they were first for Roosevelt
and only for Tlughea If aome aort of
s "aatlafactory" statement on prin
ciple! could be extracted from the
Jurist, railing that, they flaunted
the big stick of a third ticket.
There appeared very little doubt
today that Hughes can be nominated
If tlie big three Penrose, Darnel
and Crane -any 10. But the big
three do not want to aay ao until
they can be assured of a united party
behind Hughee. They do not tiling
Roosevelt can poulbly draw all the
votes of a re-unlted party, They do
not think any of the "farorlte aona"
la of, sufficient potenoy to defeat
Wilson without progressive, support,
la other worda, the old guard U In
the position of having control, but
not knowing what to do with Ita con
trol. ,
One counter suggostton advanced
ty the uncompromising progressive
rroup waa for the republicans to go
ahead and nominate Hughes and the
progressives to choose Roosevelt.
Then If the acceptance atatement by
Hughes aufBclently ;. supports the
Roosevoltlan brand of preparedness,
It Is planned that Roosevelt will with
draw acceptance of the progressive
nomination and throw, support to
'Hughes. . It was pointed out today
that the colonel Tins all along main
tained that be Is fighting for a cor:
tain set of principles, for In hi' St.
k speech he said he accepted sup
port solely In the knowledge that this
support (came through the approval
of the principles for which he stands,
ml not necessarily of approval of
fclm personally. .
Practically all loadera republican
and progressive -have given up hope
of penetrating Justice Hughes' sil
ence before the .balloting comes In
the 0. 0. P. meeting. The alllos'
hope of defeating htm In the ballot
ing comes, through a belief that If
the roll calls can' be prolonged
through half a doxen or more bal
lots the Justice might formally with

REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CHAIft
MAN CHARLES O. HILLEt.
Chicago, June 3. The progressiva
national committee today named
what Is practically a conference com
mlttee to consult with republlcana
upon a platform and a candidate.
,Thls committee, consisting of George
w. rerkiM, Governor Hirara jonn
eon of California, and Horace Wilkin
son, Is to be known, as the publicity
But. said Wm. Aldea White, pa
tlonal commltteomaa from Kaniaa,
after the meeting, it Is to have exe
cutive powers, very wide powers, al
though Ita primary appeal to the re
publican delegates will be through
paid advertisements In Chicago
papers. ,,'..
Victor Murdock, national chair
man, evoked applause by these two
statements:
"I am not tor any non-committal
candidate' at thla time."
"I am not a republican, and I do
not intend to be." .
At ach declaration there waa ap
plause. ' So far aa the national committee
Is concerned the sentiment waa to
make no nominations until 8aturday.
Murdock's speech emphasised the
necessity, for maintaining the pro
gressive party organisation, unless
j 'there Is a complete change" of sen
Itlment among republlcana aa to plat
I form and candidate.
The name of Hughes was not men
tioned, except for the inference In
Murdock's speech as to a non
committal candidate. Neither was
the possibility of nominating any one
but Roosevelt considered.
The progressive platform, as out
lined by White, contemplates the pro
gressives telling the republicans that
the moosera' choice la Roosevelt. It
this proves unacceptable, the repub
licans can then name their first
choice. Should this In turn be dis
pleasing to' the; bull" moose, then a
, second progressive choice will be pro
'posed, but this will be their only get
'together efforts."- '
1 If the second string man be per
sona non grata, thon , the moosera
.will go ahead with their nominating.
I Opposition, among many delegates
arose after, the proposal to defer nom
inations until Saturday.

Chicago, Jane 5. -"Justice Hughes'
nomination on an early ballot ie in
evitable," Frank H. Hitchcock, un-
official Hughee boomer, declared In
a statement tnia anernoon. -justice
Hugh will receive more rotea on
the CSt ballot than-the combined
strength of the favorite eons candi
dates, and hie nomination on an ear
ly ballot is inevitable," the announce
ment concluded. ' r. '
While heralded In advance as
Hitchcock'a clalma of Hughes' exact
strength, thf atatement proved a tab
ulation of what he regards to be the'
favorite sons' strength, with the add
ed blanket claim of Hughes' success.
"The maximum atrength of the
'favorite aona' state," the statement
said, "is as follows; Delaware, $ tor
Dirpont; Idaho, 8 for Borah;. Illlin
ols, 68 for Sherman; Indiana, 30 for
Fairbanks; Iowa, 16 for Cummins;
Massachusetts. 16 for Weeka; Ohio,
48 tor Burton; Wisconsin, 15 for La
Follettertotal, 117.
"In the remaining states delegates
are instructed for the favorite sons
candidates as follows: Kentucky, 8
for , Fairbanks; Michigan. 80 for
Ford; 'Minnesota, 24 for Cummins;

Then followed predictions of
Hughes' success. '
Hitchcock's atatement was the .first
giving a line on what he expects to
develop. It went farther than pre-
vtoua eetlmatea, for It meant that
iHughesltes are expecting better than
(345 on the first ballot, with only 148
j more required to swing things
(Hughes' way.

many must aat no meat for tha next
eight - weeks, Herr Adolph von
Batockl, Germany's new food "dicta
tor," now holding one of the most
important posts in the empire, toil
the United -Press today IA frank
discussion of the food situation.
This re&ulatton, the new food mln
ieter said, ahould cause no alarm in
Germany, and no elation in tha campt,
of Germany's enemies.
"If the coming harvest Is only me
dium," he said, "the starvation of
Germany through the British block
ade is out of the question." .
"The siege of Germany," Herr von.
Batockl said, "has Just begun. Tha
coming eight weeks may cause soma
discomfort to those Germans who are
fond of meat Furthermore, the meat
shortage Is apt to last for at least
three months, he declared frankly. ,
"The cattle are lean now, because
of a poor harvest in 1115," he said.
They can not be slaughtered now.
We must wait until they are fatten
ed on paaturage. But meanwhile wa
have enough meat for our military
hospitals and "places where H Is ur
gently needed.
"At all events there is enough food
in Germany, but it is necessary that
civilians eat no meat for the next
eight weeks. Starvation is out of tha
question, but we must consider not
only the present food situation but :
the situation during the coming win
ter. In order to insure a supply tor
this winter, we must eat meat spar
ingly during the summer. Probably
meat cards will be issued throughout
Germany and there will be a few
meatless weeks.
"The cause of the present short
age Is the bad harvest last year. If
the harvest this year la even medium
the food situation will begin to Im
prove the middle of July or the first
of August"
Herr von Batockl's Job is to take
the stranglehold out of the British
blockade. He must prevent the star
vation of Germany by her enemies.
He. must provide equitable distribu
tion of the nation's food supply. , He
has already done much and by keep- .
ing the public well Informed regard

public co-operation he expects to do
mucn more. ., I
To understand his task, an Ameri
can must imagine the United States
blockaded, no corn to fatten the cat

halt a pound of meat, a fifth of a
pound of butter, war ' bread, and
plenty of vegetables "each week. Ha
