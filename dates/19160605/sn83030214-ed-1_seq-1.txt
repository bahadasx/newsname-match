GERMAN CLAIMS FALSE,
BRITISH ADMIRALTY STATES
I.nvdov. Junt 4.?A statement iitUtd to-night hy
thf Brilith Admiralty says:
"Until thc commandcr in chicf has had time to consult
the officers engaged and write a full dispatch, any attempt
to give a detailed history of the naval engagement which
hegan on the afternoon of the 31st of May and ended in
the morning hours of the 1st of June would evidently be
premature. but the results are quite plain.
"The Grand Kleet came tn touch with the German
High Seas Fleet at 3:30 on the afternoon of May 31. The
leading ships of the two fleets earried on a vigorous fight,
in which the battle cruisers, fast battieships and subsidiary
craft all took an active part.
"The losses were severe on both sides, but when the
main body of the British Heet came into contact with the
German High Seas Fleet a very brief period sufficed to
compel the latter, who had been severely punished, to seek
refuge in their protected waters. This manoeuvre was ren
dered possible by low visibility and mist. and although the
Grand Fleet were now and then able to get in a momentary
contact with their opponents, no continuous action was
possible.
"They continued the DUTftUit until the light had wholly
failed, while the British der.troyers were able to make a
successful attaek upon the enemy during the night.
"Meanwhile. Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. having dnven
the enemy into port, returned to the main scene of the ac?
tion and scoured the sea in search of disabled vessels. By
noon the next day. June 1, it became evident there was
nothing more to be done. He returned therefore to his
bases. 400 miles away. re-fuelled his fleet. and in the even?
ing of June 2 was again ready to put to sea.
"The British losses have already been fully stated.
There is nothing to add to or subtract from the latest ac
count published by the Admiralty. The enemy losses are
less easy to determine. That the accounts they have given
to the world are false is certain. and we eannot yet be sure
of the exact truth. But from such evidence as has come to
our knowledge the Admiralty entertain no doubt that the
German losses are heavier than the British, not merely
relatively to the strength of the two fleets. but absolutely.
"There seems to be the strongest ground for supposing
that included in the German losses are two battieships. two
dreadnought battle-cruisers of the most powerful type. two
of the latest light cruisers, the Wiesbaden and the Elbing.
a light cruiser of the Rostock type. the light cruiser Frau
enlob. nine destroyers and a submarine."

men-of-war, and that there was nothing to add to ar lubtfBd
from the original announeement of the British loeMS.
The statement gave the (ierman lOMefl as two battleships.
two dreadnought battle cruisers. four light cruisers. nine tor?
pedo boat destroyers and a submarine.
British losses. according tn the Adrniralty, were three
battle-cruisers. three light cruisers and t-ivrht destroyers, niak
ing a total of fourteen.
Berlin claims, bflflklefl theae, the sinking of a British dread?
nought and two destrqyers.
The (iermans admit the loss of eleven waflhipfl.
The pessimism which prevailed as a result of tht Admi
?ralty's original statement of losses. which ifl now confliderfld to
have been needlessiy candid, and conservativfl in und'-restimat
; ing the extent of the German losses Sfl compared with those of
IGreal Britain, has been greatly lessened by the latest statement.
Declares Lutzow Was Sunk.
A dispatch from Copenhagen says rumon are current in
Hamburg that two additional (ierman warships than those an?

talen and the battle cruiser LtltZOW?-were .*-unk in the battle.

aged and had two large holes aft. Th<* Seydlitz is a dreadnough*
cruiser of 25,000 tons.
The Adrniralty statement to-night declarefl tha* thfl GtT

greater than those of the British.

Warrior and of twenty-eeven men wounded. On other ships
engaged in the tight 115 men were killed and R-"> wounded.
(ierman "I'ress Agency" Best.
Admiral l.ord Meresford. m an interview, said the only
mistake made was by the Admiral'v m allowing thfl (iermans
to ge\ ftrsi in the field with the news of the battle, or, as he puts
it. with "impudent f ibrications."
"Though a hard-earned sea tight. i? wa a British \ ictory."
Admiral Bereflford continued. "There was no mistake in strat
flgy made. The British objflCtivfl WSfl to sink the German fleet
or compel it to return to its base. In the absence of Zeppelin.a
for scouting purposes, the British navy was obliged to send
out heavy cruisers as outside MOUtS, because li^ht cruisers
would have been driven in without tecuring the needed informa
tion.
"Vice-Admiral Sir David lieatty, in pursuance of this ob
ject, tackled a vastly superior force, hoping to delav it until
\ ice-Admiral Sir .John R. JelUcoe's battle tlcet arrived to destrov
rhc Germans. Vice-Admiral Beatty schieved a brilliant j-uccess,
because on the arrival of Vice-Admiral JeUicoe the (iermans
fled. We attained <>ur object; the (iermans failed b> attain
theirs. We lost cruisen which we can aflford to lose; the Ger?
mans lost battleships which they cannot afford to lose."
