SCORES HUGHES
FOR HIS SILENCE
OYSTER, BAY, June 5.—A
Rooeevelt drive on Hughes was
seen today In a statement by
Luclen Bonheur, progressive
leader of Long Islsnd, calling
upon the Justice for a statement
and raising a question regard
ing German American support.
"Hughes can keep silent on
many things, but when attacked
with the German American al
liance Issue he has no business
to be silent." Bonheur's state
ment, Issued with the knowl
edge of Roosevelt, added.
"Otherwise, he Is the candi
date of the Oerman-Amerlcan
Alliance."

ABoy in Pantry Who
Can'tDecideßetween
Hot Mince Pie or Jam
That Is the Attitude of the Republican
Convention, Says Russell; Teddy Is the
Sizzling Pie, Full of Pep, but "Old Guard
Colic" May Result From Its Eating;
Hughes Is the Jam.
Noted American Economist and Political Expert Attending Republican and Democratic Con

CHICAGO, Ilk, June 5, 1916.—The men at this convention that will really pick the re
publican candidate for president are like a thild with painful memories that has strayed
alone into the family pantry.
Up there on the shelf is fresh Roo«evelt mince pie. piping hot, with
hard sauce But then, how about Old Guard colic? Better go slow OB
that. Fasily within reach is a dish of Hughes jam. But the Progressiva
switch hangs by the door and many an anatomy is still tingling from th«
last time that was u*ed. So it is slow on the jam also.
Mere in the cooler is fine Fairbanks ice cream, but we aren't looking
for ice cream this year. On other shelves are Weeks muffins. Burton hard*
tack. Cummins breakfast food and other highly-recommended dishes from
rookies to cabbage, all of superior quality for anybody that likes that sort of
thing and some of them guaranteed t<j be free from colic or trouble with
switches.
The child in the pantrv doesn't care a whoop for any of them. His
fancy is for PIK OR JAM, and the thing he is balancing all the time is the
chance of the colic ap.nintt the chance of the switch.
Prophets Can't Give You Sure Tips,
Says Russell, Who's Had Long Experience
If you could remove either, he would take his finger out of his mouth
ami make up his mind in a flash. As it is, he stands there fiddling and
keeps everybody guessing. IM'j
One moment he makes a start for the Roosevelt pie. with loud applause, and you think
the thing is as good as settled. And the next minute he has a vivid recollection of what
the stand-pat element might do to him, or thinks of Henry Ford and his threats, or gets a
warntng from hyphens or pacifists, and you are ready to bet on the Hughes jam.
The professional prophets go to and fro and look wise and talk as if they had
. sure tips. But do not be deceived by that. Nothing else that man does is done more
easily. I've been covering national conventions for 28 years and never saw one
without its set of prophets, none of whom turned out to have any more of a fore
handed cinch on things than anybody else.
There isn't any money in the prophet business, but there must be no end of mysteriows
satisfaction, judging bv the way it is followed!
Only one thing is clear—if it is to be pie 1 , it will have to be grabbed in a rush, so as to
knock out any thought about colic. And that is where the "old guard" of stand-pats thinks
it has the game in hand.
Best Convention Show, He Says, Since
the Grant-Garfield Affair of 1880
It has 20R votes that it can cast for anybody it chooses from David Lamar, the Wolf
of Wall Street, to ( Hiver Osborne, the myth.
To these thev .add 416 other delgates equally controlled by other gentlemen that are
equally solid agaittst a stampede, and they tell you that all the noise between here and
Oyster Hay can't nominate under such circumstances.
The fact that this year there are no delegation contests, to amount to anything, is a
sign that thoe gentlemen may be sound in their views. Delegation contests mean that the
gentlemen that control things are rowing among themselves. If they don't row among
themselves they are usually able to put things over as per program.
Meantime, the child in the pantry is the most interesting puzzle mystery we have had
in politics these many years.
In fact, we haven't had a convention that was as good a show since 1880, when the
stampede was to be for Grant, but the fact that emerged was Garfield. What? Does that
suggest anything?
HITCHCOCK GIVES OUT FIGURES
TO PROVE HUGHES WILL BE NAMED
BY PERRY ARNOLD
U. P. Staff Correapondent
CHICAGO, June 5 By
mid afternoon today the
boom of Justice Hughes
had achieved a command
ing lead.
Progressive leaders pri
vately admit a decided
slump in the Roosevelt
boom, but predict a revival
later.
The fact that Frank
Hitchcock considered the
chances <>f Hughes good
enough to warrant deal

looked upon as significant.
Justice Hughes' nomination "on
an early ballot I* Inevitable," he
declared in a stateraant. "Justice

What do you think of Weatherman Salis

early ballot Is Inevitable,'' he said.
While heralded In advance as
Hltchcock'a claims of Hughes' ex
act strength. the statement proved
a tabulation of what he regards to
be the favorite sons' strength, with
the added blanket claim of Hughes'
success.
Organization leaders continued
today to put forward gentle feel

dates. In an effort to attract pro
gressive support.
Nowhere Is there any organized
opposition to Muglles.
Kven the Root supporters In the
New York delegation state frankly
that they are for Root, but not
against Hughes

Therefore, their preliminary feel

certain whether an agreement
could be possible with Hughes, as
a candidate, running on any sort
of n platform which the progres
sives might require.
The old guard went so far as to
embrace a scheme by which the
progresshes might be able later
to say (hey were the ones who put
Hughes over.
The scheme proposed by the old
guard was to have the progres
