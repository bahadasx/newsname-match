undiminished violence the Germans
continued their attacks last night

afternoon says these assaults were
unsuccessful.
The Germans attacked French posi

The text of the statement follows:
"On the left bank of the river Mouse

"There was ferocious fighting be

ericmy made great use of flaming
liquids, our troops prevented their ad
versaries from making any progress.
"In the Vosges an attack by the t
enemy at a point west of Oarspach
resulted in their becoming possessed
of three trenches. Shortly after we
delivered a counter attack and drove
the Germans from all the positions
they occupied." '

Chicago, June 5. To the suffragists
goes the honor of opening convention
week in Chicago, for the congressional
union for woman suffrage, an organ
ization pledged to the support of the
Susan B. Anthony suffrage amendment,
opened its convention at the Black-
stone theatre for a three days' session,
during which time it is planned to
form a body to be known as the wo
man's party.
Tomorrow the national American
Woman Suffrage association, a federa
tion of state suffrage associations, wili
begin a two days' session at the Prin
cess theatre. The two organizations
differ in that the former seeks to se
cure suffrage through national chan
nels, while the latter is working for
suffrage in individual state, submit
ting the question of the women votes
to electorate of the states.
The suffragists have prepared a
plank calling for equal suffrage wbic'j
will be presented to the republican
convention with the request that it
be placed in the party's platform.
According to suffrage leaders, the
women hold the balance of power for
the states in which they are allowed
to vote cast one-fifth of the electoral
vote and one-third of the votes neces
sary to elect a president. Their
strength, they declare, will be swung
to the party favoring suffrage and de
claring for it.

one of the Norwegian women, "when

THE WAR TODAY
There is virtually no let np in
the German effort i push bark the
French lines n the Verdun front
northeast of the fortress.
After failing in an assault yes
terday, northwest of Fort Vans
the t-ronn prince's troops returned
to the attack hist night, driving
the French between the fort and
(lie village of Damloup, to the
southeast. There, as in other ef
forts, they were unsuccessful and
General ivclle's forces still re
main in possession of the fort,
Paris declares today.
The Turkish war oftice claims
further successes against the llus

Justice Gains in Support of
Both Republicans and
Progressives.
ROOSEVELT OUSTED?
Number of Leaders Declare
Colonel Is Already Out
of Big Race.
Chicago, June 5. The movement
for the nomination of Justice Hughes
today took on the aspects of a genuine
boom.
Arriving delegations brought evi
dence of sentiment in favor of the
jurist and men who have been identi
fied with the "old guard" of the re
publican party declared that many
delegates instructed for others were
ready to turn their votes to him after
the first ballot.
The lack of controlling leadership
by the men who have composed the
"old guard" is emphasized on every
hand. They express themselves as not
favoring Justice Hughes for any rea
son of personality but because the
delegates bringing first hand reports
of sentiment from the states believe
he can be the harmonizer who can
rehabilitate the party and bring in
the progressive strength.
T. K. Sentiment Cooling.
On every hand explanations are
sought of the failure of sentiment
for
Colonel Roosevelt to crys-
talize. A week ago those who opposed
lhe nomination of Roosevelt were fear
ful of a stampede to him hut now it
is said that is impossible. Many can
not understand what brought about
the change.
Republican leaders after a canvass
today declared that Colonel Roose-
ivelt's ultimate strength would not be
more than 200 delegates at the outside
and they believe the number would be
nearer 150 delegates. It is asserted
that the remaining 750 or 800 dele
gates would not vote for him under
any circumstances.
Chicago. June 5. Uncertainty and
restraint were dominant factors here
today, 4S hours before the gavels were
scheduled to fall at the Colsieum and
the Auditorium for the opening of the
republican and progressive national
conventions.
The republican pre-convention drift
antTSwell of rumor, semi-official re
port and pure gossip rolled from
Hughes to Roosevelt and back to
Hughes; then into the more quiet ed
dies of favorite sondom; only to break
in far-flung spray and evaporate. From
hour to hour this movement went on
while nothing seemed to crystalize in
to tangibility.
Leaders Show Restraint.
Restraint of a careful, calculating
kind marked every movement of big
and little leaders, who fitted cushions
into chairs; rolled up their sleeves;
took close scrutiny of the men oppo
site them at the big game board and
made those minute preparations which
presage the long contest and the hard
contest.
"If we can hold our crowd back un
til Friday or Saturday," remarked one
adroit manager of a lesser republican
candidate, "we stand a migh'y good
show. Let these big fellows go out in
front and set the pace for the first
laps. We will begin to use gasoline
when these fellows have gone into
the fence, or to the pits for repairs.
"It is not a case, as so many seem
to think, of any man to beat Wilson,
but it is a case of the best man to re
unite the republican party. That is
the issue upon which this nomination
finally will be settled.'"
This was much the situation as the
last influx of delegates, alternates and
camp followers took place during the
hours up to noon.
If there was one man among the
straw-hatted, cigar-smoking thou
sands that thronged into some twenty
five odd acres of hotel lobbys and cor
ridors, who had a definite idea of
what would happen during the next
two or three days in connection with
the all-absorbing question of a nomi
neethat man was as elusive as the
one sought by Diogenes.

LANSING SCORES
WILSON'S CRITICS
Secretary of State Declares Some Tut
Property Rights on a Par
With Life.
Watertown, X. Y., June 5. Secretary
Lansing, before the Jefferson County
Bar association here Saturday night,
scored critics of the administration's
foreign policy who would have it do
more than has been done in the nego
tiations arising from the war, and re
plied ttrttlose who complain the United
States had beeir more vigorous in its
dealings with Germany than with
Great Britain.
"The violation of the national right.!
of life is a much more serious offend
against an individual and against' His
nation," said Secretary Lansing, "than
the violation of the legal right of prop
erty. Can you doubt for a moment
which one gives this government the
greatest concern?
That there was an influence in
America and even in congress which
put right of property and right of life
on a par, Secretary Lansing declared,
showed that the "great heart of the
republic is threatened with fatty de
generacy through those who have lost
their patriotic vigor; that many Ameri
cans have become lovers of ease rather
than lovers of national honor."
Mr. Lansing, in part, said:
"The great war has caused so many
conditions which are entirely new
and presented so many questions
which were never before raised or
even thought of that it has been ro
easy task to meet and answer them.
The relations between neutrals and
belligerents were never more difficult
of adjustment.
It was never harder to preserve
neutral rights from invasion by the
desperate opponents in the titanic
conflict in which the power, if not
the life, of the great empires of the
earth is at stake. The peoples and
governments at war are blinded by
passion; their opinions are unavoid
ably biased; their conduct, frequently
influenced by hysterical impulses
which approach to madness.
"Patience and forbearance are es
sential to a neutral in dealing with
such nations. Acts, which under nor
mal conditions would be most offensive,
must be considered calmly and with
out temper."
j MORE MARINES SENT

Washington, June 5. The United

Washington. June 5. Dominican

details of the occupation of the town
land indicated that the situation on the
island was more serious than had been
believed here.

GERMAN SAILORS
TELL OF LOSSES
Men on Teuton Ships Snnk in Sea Bat
tle and Rescued Later Describe
Own Losses as Colossal.
London, June 5. German sailors,
rescued by Scandinavian steamers,
described the Teutonic losses in the'ber industry in a state of industrial
Jutland battle as colossal, according
to a Copenhagen dispatch to the Tel
egraph Exchange company. A large
number of the crew of the cruiser
Weisbaden and men from several Ger
man torpedo boats have been rescued
and brought to Copenhagen. They re
port that many of their comrades, af
ter floating for 36 hours on raits with
out food or water, drank the sea water,
became insane and jumped into the
ocean.
The German survivors say that sev
eral of their torpedo boats and sub
marines were capsized by the British
shells and sank instantly. Bodies of
both British and German sailors are
beginning to be washed ashore on the
coast of Jutland.
Captains of steamers arriving in
Scandinavian harbors report that the
big German cruisers which were op
erating along the Courland coast, near
Riga, have been withdrawn and that
a large squadron of destroyers which
had been patrolling the southern Bal
tic was not sighted last week.

ENTERS PLEA FOR
TIMBER INDUSTRY
Interpretation of Sherman Anti-Tnst
Law Wrong as Applied to Lumber
men Argues Attorney.
Washington, D. C, June 5 Pleading
for government aid in placing the tim-
preparedness and of achieving a high
plane of efficiency, L. C. Boyle of
Kansas City, representing the National
Lumber Manufacturers' association
today filed with the federal trade com
mission the first volume of a brief in
the first general investigation by this
commission.
Mr. Boyle declares that the lumber
industry has no hostility toward the
Sherman anti-trust law but does be
lieve that its interpretation should be
such that great industries be permit
ted to progress with the cooperation
of the units of the industry, as long as
such cooperation does not constitute
restraint of trade. Cooperation under
government regulation to prevent
abuses of destructive competition was
asked and he then analyzed the situ
ation in the country to show the need
of active cooperation for the protec
tion of the nation's forests againts de
struction by unregulated competition.
After analyzing the condition, showing
the needs for reforms, Mr. Boyle com
pletes his- volume of presentation of
conditions with this statement:
"The industry can and should do
much within itself to overcome its dif
ficulties. . The insistent need, however,
is the earnest and helpful cooperation
of government. We ask no favor.
There is a public, as well as private
interest at stake. Of this, there is no
question. Why should not the two
parties in interest, following the dic
tates of common prudence, get to
gether and solve the problem? There
is no other way. Legitimate competi
tive conditions must be maintained if
we consistently adhere to our ideals of
national development Destructive
competition, however must cease if
these ideals are to be realized."

London, June 5, (3.27 p.
m.) British officers of the
fleet which participated in
the Jutland battle and have
returned here, identify two
of the warships sunk as th
Hindenburg and the LutzowJ
While Germany holds to her origi
nal announcement of losses a
battleship, three cruisers and sev- ;
eral torpedo boats the British ad
miralty says there is the strongest i
grounds for supposing that the "
Germans lost two battleships, two ;
dreadnought battle cruisers, four
light cruisers, nine torpedo boat
destroyers and a snbmarine IS
vessels in all. In addition a Co
penliagen dispatch says the Ger-
man battle cruiser Seydlitz, not
heretofore mentioned, was sight
ed Thursday morning 3S mile
west of Fano Islands, going sooth
pursued by British warships. She
was badly damaged and bad two
large holes aft. The Seydlitz is a
dreadnought battle cruiser of 25,
000 tons.
The latest reports received by the
British admiralty enabled the Asso
ciated Press to give the following re
view of the naval engagement off the
Jutland coast with various incidents,
and results, as viewed from the Brit
ish side:
During the night of May 31-June 1,
British destroyers made a determined
attack on the tretreating German battle
fleet which hastened its flight The
British fleet remained In possession of
the scene of battle during the morning
of June 1 and traversed the field four
times, finding no enemy to fire upon.
The commander in chief took his fleet
back to its bases at his leisure, and five
hours after its arrival reported the
battle fleet ready for action.
Give German Losses.
As regards the German losses, defi
nite evidence, it is declared, has now
been obtained that they were deliber
ately falsified and that the following
were destroyed:
Two battle cruisers; one at least,
and probably two battleships; four
light cruisers, eight destroyers and
one submarine.
The remainder of the German battle
cruiser squadron may have reach home
ports but the ships were all severely
damaged, as also were ships of the
Koenig class, which came under the
fire of a portion of the British battle
fleet
Hindenburg and Lutzow Sunk.
Besides the above, the Associated
Tress has obtained information from
returned officers of the fleet that they
are able to identify the lost German
battle cruisers as the Hindenburg and
the Lutzow.
Naval officials here point out that on
account of their proximity to home
ports, some of the German vessels,
which were as badly injured as was the
British cruiser Warrior, would have
been able to make nort.
The German warship Hindenburg has
hitherto been classified as a battleship.
Berlin, June 5. An authoritative ac
count of the North sea battle issued
today gives the first detailed picture
of the great engagement between the
German high sea fleet and that of the
British. Many details of the engage
ment are suppressed for strategic
reasons. The recital, however, meets
clearly what is characterized as the
British attempt to ex'plain defeat by
the statement that the German sea
forces in the action were much larger
than those which the British were
able to bring into play.
This account declares explicitly that
26 of Admiral Jellicoe's uost power
ful battleships, including six of the
most modem Queen Klizabeth class
and the entire British flying wing,
composed of battle cruisers equal in
every respect except armor protection
to dreadnoughts, were engaged in all
but the early stages of the day battle.
The fleet thus assembled surpassed in
tonnage and weight of broadsides the
German force engaged, was at least
equally modern and was far speedier
than the squadron of German pre
dreadnoughts which, lumbering along
