RUSSIAN ASSAULTS FAIL
Italians Cheeky Further Progress by
Austrians in Region of
Arsiero.
London, June 4. The region of Vaux
and Damloup, northeast of Verdun,
has been the scene of further futile
attempts of the Germans to pierce the
French line. All the attacks were set
at naught by the French fire, except
a night attack between Damloup and
Fort Vaux, where the Germans ob
tained a foothold in French trenches.
From these, however, they were imme
diately driven out by a counter attack.
The Canadian troops and the Ger
mans have been battling fiercely on
the Ypres salient. The German guns
opened up several days ago, deluging
the Canadian positions and the sur
rounding territory with shells. Then
the German infantry advanced along
an extended front of almost two miles,
capturing trenches. In a series of
counter attacks, in which bomb and
bayonet played an important part, the
Canadians regained most of the lost
ground and have reorganized their po
sitions. On the Russian front violent artil
lery duels are going on in the Bessa
rabian and Volliynian sections. Sev
eral Russian infantry attacks against
the Austrians were repulsed.
The Italians In the region of Arsiero
are holding the Austrians from further
advances In the desperate struggle
that Is going on In this region. The
Austrians, with large effectives, at
tempted to break through the Italian
line in the direction of Onaro, but
were driven back. The bombard
ments are still heavy on the other sec
tions of the Austro-Halian front.
According to unofficial advices from
Salonlki, General Sarrail, the French
commander, has declared martial law
in the entire zone occupied by the
entente allies, and the allied troops
have taken over the telegraph olflces,
the port and customs houses at
Salouiki.

Received a packaft . . ther day,
Which lie failed to .pen, but laid
away.
A strange and busy man is he,
Lacking curiosity.
As time rolled on, the story is told,
Of how this package grew musty and
old.
And balmy odors strange to mention,
Drew to the package the man's at
tention. He removed the wrapper with care
and ease,
Expecting to find a llmburger cheese.
To the sorrowful part of the tale we
come,
For when he got the package un
done. It wasn't a cheese, and it wasn't a
cake,
Itut a big muskrat laid out in state;
And owing to the man's delay,
Time had started some decay.
No sweeter flower than this e'er grew,
As everyone in Bennington knew.
For his lusty shouts brought forth a
crowd,
That cautiously gathered around the
shroud.
No tears were shed, I'm sorry to tell,
Except the ones that we eg caused by
tho smell,
The board of health was then called in,
To get a permit to bury the thing.
Hut due to the odor, 'tis sad to relate,
They only came back to fumigate.
It didn't require an expert to tell,
That the rat had been dead for quite
a spell.
nd probably sick for a long time as
well.
A funeral was held by the light of the
moon,
And nobody thought it was held too
sum;
In fact 1 heard one mourner relate,
They buried the package a lot too
late.
And now 'tis over, and all is well;
Who sent that package, will anyone
tell?
A meeting was held in a sly, secret
manner,
To see who was sore on the Benning
ton Banner.
No one could tell, and no one could
say,
And there the matter still rests to
day. Itut we have Inquired rather thorough,
The package was shipped from Brat

LINEMAN ELECTROCUTED
13,000 Volts Accidentally shot Through
the Body of Frank Sanders.
Rutland. June 2. Frank C. Sanders
age 30 years, general electrician for
the Rutland Railway Light and Power
ompany, was instantly killed this
morning at the sub-station of the con-
em near Poultney when 13,0110 volts
of electricity passed through his body
Accidentally. The cause of the acci
dent is not known.
Mr. Sanders went to Poultney to ad
ust some lightning arresters on a
switch board In (lie sub-station. Just
after he had begun work R. L. Wilbur,
switch board operator, who had pre
viously cautioned Sanders, stepped
out of doors. Almost Immediately he
heard the sound of a heavy body fall
ing and the dropping of the switch.
Going indoors In found the uncon
scious form of Sanders on an iron rack
above the switchboard. It was in no
way connected with a live current at
the time.
Physicians were at once summoned
and every known means of resuscita
tion were employed without results.
General Manager It. T. Hurt who, with
other officials, hurried to the scene In
automobiles, could give no reason for
tho accident.
There are severe burns on the man's
ankles showing where lie probably
came in contact with heavily charged
electrical apparatus.
Mr. Sunders had been employed by
the company for ten years and wh.j
considered the best informed electric
Ian on the force. Ho is survived by
his wife and a four year old daughter.
ITALIAN SHOOTS BROTHER
Wounded Man in Hospital and

Rutland, June 4. Before several
friends, who will probably appear
against him when placed on trial, Yin

of Florence, a marble worker, shot
his brother, James Verono. through
the lower abdomen with a 38 calibre re
volver bullet following a fistic encount

then ran to tho home of Harry Hons
ton, where he hid under a bod, there
being found an hour later by Con
stable James E. Tennlen of Pittsford
who brought the man to the House of
Correction In this city.
The Injured man was treated by Dr

MOOSE SAY HUGHES MUST TALK
Must Tell Progressives Where He
Stands Before Receiving Their
Support.
Chicago, June 4. For some un
known reason, for which no explana
tion is offered, there is a growing con
viction tonight among both Republi
can and Progressive leaders assembled
here tor the national conventions, that
Colonel Roosevelt will not be nominat
ed by the older party. Among those
who hold to this view are many num
bered among the colonel's closest
friends who, none the less are not giv
ing up the fight.
The leaders who take this view of
the situation seem to think that Jus
tice Hughes is the man who could
iring the Republican and Progressive
patties together and present a solid
front to the Democratic opposition
even though they are not convinced
that the justice can win the nomina
tion. The situation which this condition
presents is unprecedented. None of
the leaders on the ground profess to
have any idea of what will happen.
It is notablo that all the speculation
so far has been principally among
the leaders, probably less than fifty
of them, and that the delegates have
had very little part in it. Little more
than half of the delegates to the Re
publican convention reached Chicago
tonight. Those who are here are un
certain of the-attitude of other men
from their states.
It seemed certain that Colonel
loosevelt could have the Progressive
nomination at once If he would say
the word and still leave the way open
to withdraw his candidacy if the Re-
mbllcan convention uumiuated a man
whom he was willing to support.
One faction among the Progressives
favors nominal ing Colonel Roosevelt
on the first day of the convention and
then await the action of the Republi
cans. Another faction would prefer
to make no nomination until after it
was known what the Republicans pur
posed to do.
On every hand tonight there is
peculation as to what the old guard
will do if it succeeds in defeating
Colonel Roosevelt for the nomination;
whether they will go the whole dis
tance and nominate a man of their
number such as Root. Fairbanks,
Weeks or Burton; or whether they
will attempt to conciliate the Progres
sives by choosing a man whom the
latter might support. The name of
Justice Hughes is tho only one that
has been brought forward s.o far as
having such possibilities.
Among the rank and file of the Re
publicans there are indications of a
genuine effort to draw the Progres
sives back into the old party. One
of these evidences is the lack of harsh
criticism and bellicose demonstrations
which characterized the convention
period of 1012. Apparently all fac
tions learned a lesson from the dis
astrous consequences following the
split four years ago and as a result
nothing Is heard in the nature of
bragadoclo or defiance. The support
ers of candidates familiarly called
favorite sons, are firm in their argu
ments, but are inclined to a far great-
tr . groc man ordinarily to extol ineir
candidates without detracting from
others.

BRITONS CLAIM
London Asserts German Losses
Were the Heavier
LIST OF SUNKEN SHIPS GROWS
Admiral Beresford Declares Story of
Engagement Sent Out From
Berlin Is False.
London, June 5. Hope that some of
the sailors who manned the British
warships lost in the Skager Rak sea
tight had been rescued is failing as
tales of the great battle are received at
Copenhagen. As more details of the
titanic struggle are received pride in
the British navy grows. The admiral
ty states that the Hermans lost two
battleships, two dreadnaught cruisers,
three light cruisers, nine destroyers
and one submarine.
The Get mans admit the loss of the
battleship Pomincrn, the battle cruiser
Dertllingor and Lulzow, tho cruisers
Weisbaden Frauenlob and Killing and
seven destroyers.
London, June 5. A statement Issued
last night by the British admiralty
confirming previous accounts of the
battle between the British and German
fleets, repeats that the German ac
counts of the German losses are false
and that although the evidence is still
incomplete enough is known to justify
stating that the German losses were
greater than the British, "not merely
relatively to the strength of the two
fleets, but absolutely." There is the
strongest ground for believing, says
the statement, that the German losses
include two battleships, two dread
nought battle cruisers of the most
powerful type, nnd two of the latest
light cruisers. In, addition to smaller
craft, including r submarine.
A dispatch from Copenhagen says
minor are current in Hamburg that
two German warships besides those
announced in the German communi
cation, the battleship Westfalen and
the battle cruiser Lulzow, were sunk
in the battle. A wireless dispatch re
ceived in London Saturday from Ber
lin said the German admiralty ad
mitted the loss of the Westfalen.
The admiralty statement last night
declares that the German losses In
the light were not only relatively but
absolutely greater than those of the
British. Maintaining its practice of
nation, the admiralty still refrains
from giving tin names of the lost Ger
man ships.
The official list of the casualties
among ollicers shows that hardly a
single ollicer of the line escaped from
the British cruisers sunk in the bat
tle. An additional casualty list of
petty ollicers shows that 43 of them
were saved from the Queen Mary,
Invincible, Fortune, Ardent and
Shark. None was saved from the
Indefatigable, Defense. Black Prince,
ripperary. Turbulent. Nomad or Nes
tor. The list gives the names of f't
men killed aboard the Warrior and
of 27- men wounded. On other ships
engaged in the fight 11.") men were
killed and Sii wounded.
Admiral Lord Beresford in an
interview yesterday, while contend
ing strongly for the view that there
was no failure in the British strategy
and that Vice-Admiral Beatty won a
brilliant success, though It was dear-
Iv bought, declares that the only mis
take made was by the admiralty in
allowing the Germans to get first in
the field with the news of the battle.
or as he puts it, with "impudent
fabrications." Otherwise, said Lord
Beresford, no fault can be found with
the admiralty.
The text of the statement follows.
according to a dispatch from London:
"Until the conintnnderin-chlef has
had time to consult the ollicers en
gaged and write a full dispatch, any
attempt to give a detailed history of
the naval engagement which began
on the afternoon of the 31st of May
nnd ended in the morning hours of the
1st of June, would evidently be penea
lure. But the results are quite plain.
"The grand fleet came in touch with
the German high seas fleet at 3.30 on
the afternoon of May 31. The leading
ships of the two fleets carried on a
vigorous fight, In which tho battle
cruisers, fast battleships nnd suhsid
lury era ft all took an active part.
"The losses were severe on both
sides, but when the main body of the
British fleet, came into contact, with
the German high seas fleet a very
brief period siilllced to compel tho
bitter, who had been severely pun
Ished, to seek refuge in their pro
tected waters. I Ills maneuver was
rendered possible by low visibilities
and mist, nnd although the grand
fleet were now nnd then able to get
In momentary contact with their
opponents, no continuous action was
possible. They continued the pursuit
until the light had wholly failed
while the British destroyers were able
to make n successful ptlnck upon the
enemy during the night.

Should the vote call tor a strike the

It Is probable that if a strike is to

Two progressive national commit
teemen, Harold lekes of Illinois and
William Holton Dye of Indiana, last
night issued statements regarding tho
progressives' interests.
"Certainly the progressives will not
nominate Justice Hughes without
knowing his position on the vital is
sues of the day," said Mr. Ickes. "Tho
possibility of;a Joint : nomination of
Justice Hughes by republicans- and
progressives is therefore u remote con
tingency. On the fact of the present
situation Justice Hughes Is plainly
impossible of consideration for tho
progressive nomination.''
Declaring that Indiana progressives
are for Mr. Roosevelt "or some one
just as good, a man in whom they havo
implicit confidence," Uational Commit
teeman Dye of indiana said the pro
gressives are willing to lay aside their
party emblem or some of the things
they have fought for to "accomplish
a success of their broader patriotic
movement."
Mutual interest of progressives and.
republicans of Oregon was evinced by
chance of seats between the rival dele
gates and alternates. The Oregon re
publicans who arrived today have
appointed five progressives as their
alternates in the republican conven
tion hall. The progressives from Ore
gon have returned the courtesy by
nppoiiulng five of the regular repub
licans as their alternates in the-progressive
meeting.
Seated on the progressive conven
tion floor as delegates or alternates
will be 33 women, the largest feminino
delegation of 12 coining from Wash
ington. Six others are from New
England, the Massachusetts delega
tion including Mrs. William G. Dwight
and Mrs. Elizabeth Towne of Holyoko
Dr. Agnes Victor, Mrs. Harriet L. Ken
nedy and Mrs. J. B. Cerould, while
Mrs. Maud H. Elliott is from
Rhode Island.
Among the progressive leaders who
arrived yesterday was William Flinn
of Pittsburg. It wns said last night
that Waller Brown of Ohio would
probably be decided on as permanent
chairman of the progressive conven
tion. The plan suggested last week by
George W. Perkins of New York that
the progressive convention delay mak
ing any nominations until, after the
republicans have taken action found
favor among progressive leaders last
ni:iit, and it was thought probable
that such an arrangement will bo
agreed upon.
Giflord Pinchot of Pennsylvania, a
delegate to the progressive conven
tion, spent Hindi time among leaders
at republican headquarters. Mr
Pinchot could see only one result in
the republican convention, and that
was the nominal ion cf Col. Roosevelt,
lie admitted thai there was strong
sentiment for.lustiee Hughes, but
said he felt this would not grow ns
rapidly as the Roosevelt with the ar
rival of more delegates.
