for Best Harmonizer.
Anything to Bring Moose Back
to Republican Fold.
A "DARK HORSE" CANDIDATE
Hughes and KooseTelt Produce
Right Elements.
Favorite Sons Do Not Have
Stampede Strength.
(By Associated Press.)
Chicago, June 5. The movement for
the nomination of Justice Hughes to
day took the aspects or a genuine
boom.
Arriving delegations brought evi
dences of sentiment in favor of the
jurist and men who have been identi
fied with the "Old Guard." of the
Republican party declared that many
delegates instructed for others were
ready to turn their votes to him after
the first ballot.
The lack of controlling leadership
by the men who have composed the
Olu Guard is emphasized on every
hand. They express themselves as not
favoring Justice Hughes for any rea
son of personality, but because the
delegates bringing first hand reports
of sentiment fom the states believe he
can 1 e the harmonizer who can re
habilitate the party and bring in the
Progressive strength.
On every hand reasons are sought
for the failure of sentiment for Colonel
Roosevelt to crystallize. A week ago
those opposed to the nomination of
Roosevelt were fearful of a stampede
to him but now it is said it is impos
sible. Many cannot understand what
broug1 t this change.
Roosevelt's Strength.
Republican leaders after a canvass
today declare that Colonel Roosevelt's
ultimate strength will not be more
than 2ny delegates. They asserted
that the remaining 750 or 800 dele
gates would not vote for him under
an- circumstances. They pointed out
that when state delegates were select
ed it was known that Roosevelt would
be a strong factor and probably a
candidate. Men were chosen who
were believed to be for harmony,
which leaders say is not synonymous
with Roosevelt and are regarded
therefore as not of the stampedable
type. The great mass of the dele
gates are uninstructed and are count
ed on to vote for any man who can
bring a majority of the Progressives
back to the Republican fold.
1 No Tnlk From Hughes.
All talk of demanding a pre-conven-tion
statement from Justice Hughes as
a condition of his nomination has been
practically abandoned. It is generally
agreed '.hat the justice will continue
to preserve his silence while he occu
pies a place on the supreme bench
but that if nominated he will imme
diately make a satisfactory statement
of his position on national questions
which will be an issue in the cam
jwiitrn. Supporters of Justice Hughes point
out that addresses made before he
went on the bench show him to be for
preparedness and sound issues from
a party point of view on all of the
more important issues. Word has
gone out from Gov. Whitman's quar
ters that it is futile to look forward to
any spectacular eleventh hour move
on the part of those who are demand
ing the jurist's nomination. No one
w ill go to Washington, said Governor
"Whitman, to induce Justice Hughes to
send a "night before the battle" mes
sage, nor will the long distance tele
phone wires be working between Chi
cago and the office or home of Jus
tice Hughes in Washington. Governor
Whitman made it clear that no one of
the men fighting for the nomination
of Justice Hughes has been delegated
by Justice Hughes to work for his
nomination.
Agree on Some One.
On every hand there seems to be sen
timent to avoid making the nominee
the campaign issue and to select some
one on whom Republicans and Pro
gressives can agree so the word will

AGAIN TRY IN VAIN TO
SMOKE OUT HUGHES
Washington, June 5. The stead
ily increasing call from Chicago for
a statement from Justice Hughes
regarding his willingness to accept
the Republican nomination and re
garding his position on various is
sues, has not affected the justice
in the least apparently.
"N" statement is contemplated,"
his secretary said.

White-Johnson Crowd for Col

Some Admit Real Sentiment of
Electorate Is for Rooseyelt.
Chicago, 111., June 5. There is a di
vision of sentiment among the Kansas
delegates on almost every subject ex
cept one. The twenty delegates from
Kansas seem to have gathered'an idea
from some source that they must beat
Roosevelt at all hazards. The delega
tion has been about half for Hughes,
half for the field with Roosevelt not
in the field. Hughes men are appar
ently switching to Root thinking they
can beat Roosevelt with Root rather
than with Hughes, going to Root a
short time after their arrival at Chi
cago. Apparently a change has come
over the dreams of some of the work
ers. This is evidenced by activities of
T. Davenport Smith and Frank Grime
at the Weeks headquarters all of
which may indicate that some one has
sent out the word "be for Weeks."
Some of the delegates now talk Fair
banks while Burton and other favorite
sons are today mentioned by Kansans
in the milling.
T. R, or
Arguments from the Progressive
camp have hardly made a dent on
Kansas delegates except to drive home
the idea that the Progressives under
the White-Johnson leadership will be
for Roosevelt through thick and thin.
Several of the Kansas delegates admit
that ultimately, if they voted the pres
ent sentiment of voters at home they
would line up behind Roosevelt after
they went through the early balloting.
They hate to admit this but when such
stand pat leaders as Frank Grimes,
Travis of Iola, Greer of Winfield, and
other prominent former Taft men are
in tttf hotel lobbies with arguments
for the colonel, there is a pricking up
of ears and a turning of the auditory
organs to the grass roots. There is
this to be said:
Roosevelt Talk, Everywhere.
Everywhere about the corridors, and
from many different states, is Roose
velt talk. But the majority of the
delegates positively declare their re
fusal to vote for him. Some of them
go so far as to say they will not sup
port the Oyster Bay man even though
the sentiment among the constituents
is for his nomination. From many of
these same delegates is an admission
that with Roosevelt at the head of
the ticket, real pep will be put in the
campaign, and that the colonel will
have four million Progressives to start
with and a host of standpatters get
ting into line on Americanism and
preparedness.
Old Guard's Overtures.
The old guard makes overtures to
Colonel Roosevelt to enter into
treaty of amity like this.
His withdrawal, elimination of
Hughes by defeat or enforced with
drawal. Nomination of minor Repub
lican candidate with understanding
agreement shall carry indorsement by
Progressives.
The first claim of the old guard is
to convince Roosevelt that he stands

Root's Nomination Will Mean

Progressive and Republican
Delegates Very Friendly.
BY W IklilAM AIA.EN WHITE.
(Special service, copyright. 1916, by
George Matthew Adams.)
In the Republican convention the
favorite son has become a joke. He
still keeps headquarters open but he
is no longer considered by the dele
gates. For as the delegates from the home
state arrive they tell the truth about
the favorite son; which is that he is no
favorite son at hime. The fellows run
ning on the state ticket are against
him. Also the congressmen are
against him. The favorite son was a
pest in state politics. He got the dele
gation to keep him quiet. But here
at Chicago his home delegation is
quietly but forcefully spreading the
news that he can't carry his home
state.
The delegations from Indiana and
Ohio and from Massachusetts are en
thusiastic in their support of their
favorte sons from the lips out. Only
three names are seriously considered
by the Republicans, Root, Hughes and
Roosevelt, and Root's name is not on
the Progressive list. A story gained
some credence in Republican circles
this afternoon that Colonel Roosevelt
had declared that he would accept
Root. But every Progressive leader
laughed at it.
Root Means Third Ticket.
The nomination of Root means a
third ticket and a revival of the feud
of four years ago. Eliminating Root,
then, Hughes or Roosevelt seems to be
the only candidates upon whom there
is the slightest chance of an agree
ment between the two conventions.
And the Progressive leaders have
made it plain that they wiil accept
Hughes only after he has made an
equivocal statement of his position on
the foreign policy and preparedness.

HONORS ARE COMING QUICKLY
Charles F. Scott Asked to Speak
on Floor of "Show."
Instead He Will Write in Ideas
on G. O. P. Platform.
(STAFF OORBESPOKTDENT.)
Chicago, 111., June 5. Kansas side
stepped the limelight in the Repub
lican national convention today when
Charles F. Scott of Iola, delegate at
large, declined two invitations to
speak on the floor of the big show.
The former Kansas congressman was
invited to second the nomination of
Senator Weeks of Massachusetts, for
the presidency and to second the nom
ination of Congressman Burke for vice
president.
There is still a chance for Kansas
in the big scramble since Scott if
slated for a place on the resolutions
committee. Scott is really a candidate
for this position. He has some posi
tive ideas concerning Americanism,
preparedness and the tariff and will
make a fight for these principles if
appointed to the committee which will
write the national platform.
Scott believes the tariff should be
pushed further to the front. He based
his belief on the theory that the Dem
ocrats will seek to sidestep their weak
tariff policies and evade the issue of
protection to American industries un
less the tariff is put well to the top
of platform.
All in Chicago Now.
Virtually all of the delegates were
in Chicago today for a chance in the
big pro-convention crowd. This after
noon the Congress hotel looked like
Copeland county in. the old days when
the convention system was in its glory
in Kansas.
Nearly three hundred Kansans are
here for the convention. More are
coming. Almost every county is represented-
The demand for convention
seats breaks all records and many
of the visitors will see the convention
through the newspaper bulletin
boards.
It is probable that Kansas delegates
will hold an informal meeting late to
day and discuss their pre-convention
organization. The first formal meet
ing of the Sunflower state delegates
will be held at Kansas headquarters
in the Auditorium hotel Tuesday
morning. Fitzpatrick for Chairman.
S. F. Fitzpatrick of Independence
is slated for the chairmanship of the
state delegation. Indications of a
fight became apparent today, how
ever, when W. Y. Morgan of Hutchin
son, lieutenant governor and a mem
ber of the big four, made known his
ambition for the chairmanship. Mor
gan is bound to Hughes. The
possibility that Fitzpatrick may vote
for Fairbanks on the first ballot and
later go to Root, Weeks or other fa
vorite sons, puts him in a position to
command votes and he is expected to
win the leadership of the .Kansas dele
gates. All of the party leaders in Kansas
who are attending the national con--ention

When asked where he was going or
what men he expected to get, the To

don't know where I will get them, but
I believe it will not be an impossible
task to find better men than some we
now have."
Keeps Names Secret
Savage refused to state what players
he has asked waivers on, but it is like

new pitchers are being sought, and it
is highly probable that some changes
are to be made in the outfield.

NOTE TO I,
President Drafting Reply to
Carranza's Ultimatum.
Will Reach De Facto Chief
Probably by Thursday.
Washingtoon. June 5. President
Wilson today began the draft of his
reply to the latest note from Carranza
demanding withdrawal of American
troops, or explanation of why the
United States should keep fts troops
on Mexican soil. It la the administra
tion's present intention to have its re
ply in Carranza's hands before the end
of the week perhaps before Thurs
day, to forestall as much as possible
expected adverse criticism of the pres
ident's Mexican policy at the Chicago
convention. With the personal help of
Secretary Lansing, the president may
complete a rough draft in time for
cabinet consideration tomorrow.
That the troop withdrawal suggest
ed would be refused, seemed certain.
That the refusal will convey to the de
facto government officials finality of
decision in this respect seemed also a
certainty. But the answer will be
couched in such terms as to leave the
Carranza government ample oppor
tunity to "keep itself right" before the
Mexican public.
Border Peace Most Prevail.
Completely peaceful conditions be
low the border, the note will state,
must prevail with some degree of cer
tainty that wholesale banditry and
lawlessness and raids on the American
side cannot recur.
APPEALJAS CASE
P. F. C. Probably Will Take It
to Supreme Court.
Will ot Make a Decision for
Several Days.
An appeal to the United States su
preme court, by the public utilities
commission, to set aside the order
made Saturday by the federal court,
fixing a 32 cent gas rate is probable.
Such was a statement made this
morning by John M. Kinkel, the only
member of the commission in the city
at that time.
A definite decision may not be
reached for several days, Mr. Kinkel
stated later, after a conference with
Fred S. Jackson, an attorney, who has
aided the utilities commission in its
s.pparent losing fight. Senator Joseph
L. Bristow, chairman of the commis
sion, will arrive in Topeka late this
afternoon and upon his arrival a con
ference will.be held.
"We have not seen a copy of the
order and one will not be received un
til this afternoon," said Mr. Jackson.
"We are not yet familiar with the full
text of the order and no doubt it will
take considerable time to decide upon
its fairness and effect."

Generally Conceded Fight Lies
Between Colonel and Hughes.
Judge's Failure to Take Aggres
sive Is Hurting His Chances.
(BY PERRY ARNOLD.)
Chicago, June 5. By mid-afternoon
the boom of Justice Hughes had
achieved a considerable lead. Progres
sive leaders practicaiiy admit a decid
ed slump in the Roosevelt boom but
predicted a revival later. The fact
that Frank Hitchcock considered the
chances of the justice good enough to
warrant his dealing in actual figures
was looked upon as significant. Hitch
cock is not given to exaggerated
claims. Organization was continued
today to put forward gentle followers
for various less candidates in an ef
fort to attract Progressive support.
Their main efforts, however, are di
rected toward decorating the Hughes
band wagoq to suit Progressive tastes.
No where is there any organized op
position to Hughes. Even the Root
supporters in the New York delegation
state frankly that they are for Root
but are not against Hughes. Gradual
ly the idea becoming paramount
with every class of delegates, barring
the radical Progressives, is the idea
that the first consideration for any
candidate must be an ability to win.
All idea of sacrificing possible victory
at the polls for the sake of continuing
any faction of the party in control of
the organization has vanished. There
is plenty of evidence that even the old
est of the Old Guard are giving more
consideration to what T. R. might not
be able to do in 1916 than to what he
did in 1912 in withholding their sup
port. No Spirit of Fight.
If Roosevelt can convince the old
organization crowd of his ability to
win in November he can win this
week. The influence of Hughes senti
ment and the Justice's Sphinxlike tac
tics is reflected by the delegates and
cldtime conventionites. Coincidently,

Los Angeles Wants Topeka's
City School Superintendent.
His Election Likely to Take
Place in Few Days.
H. B. Wilson, superintendent of To

tendent of those at Los Angeles, it be
came known here today. Since the
appointment of Superintendent I. S.
Francis of Los Angeles schools to the
head of the Columbus, Ohio, school
system the school board there has been
in communication with educators all
over the country. Mr. Wilson has re
ceived several letters from Judge O. S.
Bordwell, president of the board, ask
ing him to make a formal application
for the position.
"I am not an active candidate for
the position," Superintendent Wilson
said today when questioned concern
ing the probability of his being elected.
"I am entirely satisfied with my posi
tion here. However, I have received
several flattering communications
from the board asking if I am avail
able for the position and urging me to
make a formal application. I sent
them a statement of my experience in
educational work, but beyond that I
have not pushed the matter.
Los Angeles school affairs are in a
decided mix-up, according to the local
papers, A rupture between Superin
tendent Francis and the board result
ed in Francis's accepting the Columbus
offer. Recently forty teachers were
dismissed by the board because of in
subordination. Feeling in the city is
divided between sympathy for Fran
cis and approval of the action of the
board. According to information re
ceived today Mr. Wilson has many
friends among California educators
and Los Angeles school men and his
election is regarded as very probable.
The election of Francis's successor Is
expected within a few days.
