200 TELEGRAMS ASK RELEASE
OF FORMER TREASURER
Slayer of Bena Man in 1905 Asks for
for Pardon From life
Sentence.
St Paul, Minn April 10.Gov-
ernor J. A. A. Burnquist today re
ceived 200 telegrams asking that he
pardon Walter Smith, former
treasurer, and Pickitt, former
clerk ot the state investment ooard,
who have pleaded guilty to a second
degree larceny and second degree
torgery charge, respectively. They
have been sentenced to an indeterm
inate sentence at the state prison at
Stillwater.
A majority of the telegrams were
from Virginia,
Are Considered.
Although the applications were con
sidered, no immediate action was
taken Governor Burnquist stated
that they were taken under advise
ment.
Mrs Smith is responsible for the
name of her husband being before the
pardon board today. Following his
sentence, she appeared before the
governor's clerk and asked for clem
ency She filed an application for
Smith's pardon late Saturday.

Four cases are known to have
been considered. These are the peti
tions of Orlin Kalderwitt, Charles
Hammon, John Kelh and William E.
Coddington for their liberty.

most interesting of them all. He is
serving a second degree murder life
sentence for killing Henry Kehring
at Bena in Itasca county in August,
1905. His plea is based upon self
defense, the case growing out of be
ing a "good fellow."
Kehring had been drunk for three
weeks, Coddington's attorney said to
day Coddington drove 80 miles In
sub-zero weather to get Kehring and
bring him home. Mrs. Kehring paid
Coddington $15 for the job. Kehring,
sober, demanded $10 of it on the
grounds that he had made Codding
ton's profit possible. Coddington re
fused. Kehring, according to the
plea, tried to shoot Coddington, the
gun failed and Coddington beat Keh
ring to it.
TORRANCE TO CONDUCT
TIMBER CUTTING CASE

the United Press today, Graham M.
Torrance, county attorney, will prob
ably conduct the first of the timber
prosecutions for unpermitted cutting.

Watch Soil Tillers'
Interests.
UPPER MISSISSIPPI OVERFLOWS
AND DAMAGES MUCH LAND
Representative Interviews Major Peek
and Gives Army Man's
Version.
In an effort to utilize the vast wa
ters in the reservoirs at the head of
the Mississippi for manufacturing
and power purposes without permit
ting them to overflow and damage
many thousands of acres, J. J. Op
sahl of this city, working in har
mony with the idea advocated at the
December meeting of the Northern
Minnesota Development association
here, has asked Congressman C. A.
Lindbergh for assistance and infor
mation.
Writes to Lindbergh.
"In the bill that you have before
the committee," wrote Opsahl to
Lindbergh, "regarding those reser
voirs, I would ask you to be sure and
provide for the lowering of the chan
nel between the dams to the lakes
at each one of those reservoirs, so
that during the winter they can be
properly emptied At the outlet of
Leech lake, at Federal Dam, at pres
ent over a mile is choked up so that
the reservoir could not be emptied.
I am glad to see the engineers admit
the importance of lowering the win
ter stage in order to take care of the
spring floods. What we should at
tempt to do with these natural and
very important reservoirs is to pro
vide so that water can be used for
manufacturing or power purposes
and navigation without waste, but
it should be borne in mind that the
most important industry is agri
culture.
"If the war department or any
Federal department takes steps that
will undermine agricultural develop
ment and prosperity, or in other
words, retard or destroy the farmers'
crops, neither navigable rivers nor
industrial water power sites will be
of any great benefit, for the reason
that in order to handle and manage
either the navy or army, food is the
most necessary product. An army
and navy is needed to protect a rich
and prosperous agricultural country,
but if nothing but a desert or an
overflowed waste tract of land that
will not raise crops, we need no pro
tection from outside nations. On
that account in handling our reser
voir systems, the Federal government
should first consider the welfare of
the men who provide our food and
clothing, and next, maintain naviga
ble streams in passable shape, and
third, that all waste or flood waters
should be taken care of so as not to
overflow the farmer."
What Maj. Peek Said.
Congressman Lindbergh called up
on Maj. E. D. Peek of the United
States engineering corps at St. Paul,
wltio replied:
"It is a fact that the snowfall this
winter at the headwaters of the Mis
sissippi has been greater than for.
many years and in the region of the
reservoirs there was an average
depth of 2.5 feet.
"Pokegama, Sandy Lake, Pine
River and Gull Lake reservoirs have
been steadily drawn down all winter,
and by April 1, practically empty,
Winnibigoshish and Leech Lake res
ervoirs should have a combined
storage capacity of 26,000,000,000
cubic feet, which is believed to be
ample to hold the sutplus from the
winter and spring precipitation
around these reservoirs.
"The weather has been favorable
so far from a gradual run off of the
snowfall, comparatively warm in the
day and freezing at night. If this
continues for a few weeks, as it usu
ally does, it will reduce the flood pos
sibilities materially. Rapidly melt
ing snow or rains might mean a flood
but it would not be the fault of the
reservoirsin fact, they would have
a tendency to reduce the height of
any that might occur."

GHOATE OPPOSES
INDIAN BILL
Former American Ambassador Not in
Favor of Giving Red Men Super
intendent Appointments.
Washington, April 10.The dip
lomatic talents of Joseph H. Choate,
former American ambassador to Eng
land, have been directed toward ob
taining proper treatment from this
government for its Indian wards. In
a letter addressed to the chairman of
the house committee on Indian affairs,
Mr. Choate directs attention to a
number of bills now pending in con
gress affecting various tribes through
out the United States, and declares
his opposition to them.
One of these measures was intro
duced by Senator Johnson of South
Dakota, and proposes to confer upon
tribes of Indians the right to select
their superintendents and other em
ployes.
"This would divest the interior de
partment of the appointing power,"
said Mr. Choate in discussing his ob
jections to it," and the Indian service
would be deprived of the wholesome
restrictions provided by the civil ser
vice. Any one familiar with In
dians can readily imagine how the
more dependent full-bloods would
thus become easy prey for conniving
mixed-bloods and unscrupulous
"whites."
Mr. Choate strenuously objects to
another bill introduced by Senator
Lane of Oregon, which would abolish
the position of commissioner of In
dian affairs and his assistants cre
ating an independent bureau with
three-commissioners subject only to
the control of congress.
Mrs. F. W. Rhoda left this morn
ing for Marinetta, Wis., where she
will visit with friends and relatives
for some time.
