jumping off the elevator' locked the
door, stopped his machine and then
attempted to. get back on the elevator
by catching at the floor of the plat

fell into the shaft. ' Officials of the

So strict is the' watch kept oyer
strangers at the - Remington Arms
plant that Deputy .Sheriff Thomas J.
Cunningham . was taken Into custody
this n'orning by a guard and prevent
ed from leaving the premises. He
finally located an official who knew
him and apologized for the incident.
This official gave a mysterious sig
nal to the guard, who permitted the
sheriff to start on his way. When he
reached thtf ntrance to the street an
other guard blocked his 'path. The
previous guard wig wagged the magic
signal and Sheriff Cunningham finally
gained the freedom of the outer world.
Sheriff Cunningham had been serv
ing papers on an employe and iwas on
his way put when a. guard stopped him
and demanded where he was going.
"I'm going out," replied the sheriff.
"Have you a ' pass ?" ,- --
"Do I need a pass to get out?"
"Certainly you do." x ' ,
When he explained that ; he had no
pass, the guana said, "Well, you 11
have to stay here, then."
"If I do I'll charge the company for'
my time,'' replied the sheriff, who re
garded the incident as a humorous ad
venture. "I don't care. , Tou can't
leave here without a' pass," was the
answer. The state , of siege continued
until the friendly company ; : official
happened along and gave the proper

Secretaries Baker and Lansing Silent of Report
Emanating From Border That Agreement
Has Been Reached As To Extent of Expedi
tion Into Mexico Villa, With 200 of Band, Re
ported Heading to Durango City, Where He
A Hoped toVGain Reinforcements. -
Washing-ton, April 10 Secretary' Lansing and Secretary:
Baker both declined to comment today on border reports that
an agreement between Washington and the Carranza govern
ment had fixed a "dead line" beyond which the American troops
would nct go in their pursuit of the Villa bandits..
Secretary Baker declared in answer to quesdons that such
an agreement would come under the pending protocol and sub
ject not . to the war department's jurisdiction. The proposed
protocol, of which little has .become 'known, still is under "dis
cussion at General Carranza s provisional capital, Queritafo.
Both the state and war departments, it was said, nothing
was known of reports of massing of Carranza troops on Gen-
eral Pershing's rear, btate department despatches located Vil
la heading toward Parral.
State- department despatches today
indicate .that officials of the Mexican
de facto government are viewing with
some anxiety the continued presence
of American troops in '. Mexico. One
despatch authoritatively described to
day as containing a hint that certain
Mexican officials believed the purpose
of the American punitive expedition,
had, been accomplished. This belief
was said to be based upon the assump.
tion that the bandits under Villa have
been dispersed.
Consul General Rogers, it . was
learned today, has advised the depart
ment that the de facto government
officials at Queritaro had. intimated to
him they would like to know how lone
the United States intended to keep the
troops in Mexico. Administration offi
cials said the defacto government had
not set a date on which, they thought
the American -troops should be with
drawn.. It was admitted In various
quarters, ' k owe ver,"-that such action
by the de facto government would not
be surprising.
- Overnight despatches of Gen. Fun
ston to the war department made pub
lic by Secretary Baker today were
summarized in the following etate-i
ment: ', s ,'
. "The latest despatch from General
Pershing, dated April 8, explains In
f requency of communication by say
ing that the wireless, has not been able
to work - and aeroplane tommunt-catioh
has been' difficult because of lack of
suitable landing places. k
The despatch again confirms early
reports of Villa being severely wound
ed in the right knee.
"Pneral Pershing reports that Ihe
has ad a very' satisfactory conference
with General Herrera and. expects to
day to :pieet General Gutierrez, to
whom he sent messages b aeroplane
to Chlhuahusa. and received back re
plies offering full co-operation. Gen
eral Pershing's comment is that every
indication shows the,, desire of the
troops of the de facto government to
aid to the extent of their ability.
... "General . Pershing further reports
that one aeroplane was badly disabled
in landing on April 6, leaving orrly
five out of the original eight now in
serviceable conditiion but it is evident
that the aeroplanes in use are per
forming valuable service."
i Secretary 'Baker received word to
day that the railroad situation 4n Mex
ico was much improved and that sruup-
olies in increasing Quantities were'eo-
ing. forward to the American forces
in Mexico, He informed : the Presi
dent that all' reports from the border
indicated the Carranza - ' forces were
co-operating in the pursuit of Villa.
Secretary Baker said he had no
information ' regarding El Paso ru-'
mors , that Carranza troopS'were being
mobilized along the American line of
communication. - He also declared
General Funston' had not indicated
need1 for additional troopa in Mexico
or for. the border patrol,' beyond the
