Plans Call for Invasion of Most Remote
Regions in Interest of Science,
Trip Slightly Hazardous
for Honeymoon
By United Press.
Yokohama, April 10. Roy C, An
drews and his bride arrived here today
from New York and San Francisco on
the steamer Tenyo Maru, equipped
and ready to start on their long hon
eymoon trip and tiger hunt through,
the remote wilds of western China,
Little Mrs. Andrews probably is thei
first white girl to go into such a mis
sion, for her honeymoon.
Andrews is in charge of the Amer
ican Museum of Natural History's Asi
atic zoological expedition; and he and
his bride are to bring back with them
tigers, leopards, elephants, specimens
of the rare "Snow Leopard" and
"huge, maltese-brown, man-eating; ti
ger," together with many other wild
beasts of the Chinese jungles, fcmd
mountains.
Mrs. Andrews Is the photographed
of the expedition. She carries a new,
motion picture eamera, invented by
Carl Akeley. African explorer and ele
phant stalker. She also will taka col.
or pictures of animals in the moun
tains of China.
"We will go right Into the field ofl
tiger hunting upon our arrival in Chi
na," said Mrs. Andrews, "and 11 wel
are fortunate we will send some find
,specimens of the man eating tiger to
the museum. Tf-our hopes are fulfill
ed the members of our party will, he
gin to look for big game about the sec
ond week in May. Our schedule calls'
for a year of actual work in the,
field."
At Peking tha expedition will obtain!
letters to the viceroys of the different
provinces in China. Around Foochow,
a large city on the coast between
Shanghai and Hong Kong, the tiger;
hunting will begin, for it is in this re
gion the tiger abounds.
"From Peking," said Andrews, "weJ
will sail down the coast to Fu-Chau
in Fu-Kien province. Here Mr. Heller
and Perry Caldwell, a missionary, will
join us for a hunt through the Bohea
mountains, some HOO miles inland from
tho strait of Formosa. There is big
game in this region and we should ob
tain some valuable and new specl
mens.
"From Fu-Kien my wife, Heller and
i w ill go up the coast to the mouth of
the great Yangtse river by steamer,
which will take us up the Yangtse to
Tung-ting lake. Here we will follow
another stream by flatboat as far as
w e can get toward Wei-Chau prov
ince. "This province is one of the wildest
and the most difficult to enter in Chi
na. There are no roads and few inhab
itants. The country is mountainous
and rugged. This will be the main
field or our work on this trip, though
we probably will push on into the pro
vince of Yunnan, unless the revolu
tion that has recently broken out there
makes it too dangerous. We, may,
even go into Tibet.
"All this country is semi-tropical f
cold in the mountainous regions and
warm in the valleVs. This part of
Central Asia probably formed the,
birthplace of the human race."
Few women have ever undertaken
a journey so extensive and hazardous
as this. Mrs. Andrews has inherited
an adventuous disposition. She lfl
the daughter of Major Henry Borup.
U. S. A., and the sister of the young
Arctic explorer. George Borup, Whrt
was drowned on Peary's North Pol
expedition, i hough Roy C. Andrew
is srill young, he has gained a reputa
tion as a naturalist and has twice eo
circled the world. His companion,
Edmund Heller, besides his trip withl
the Roosevelt African expedition, ha I
