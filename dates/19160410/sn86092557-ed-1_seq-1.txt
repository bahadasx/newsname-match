CRIMINAL COURT
OFF UNTIL API 20
One Special Case May Be
Brought to Trial Wed
nesday of This Wek.
?4 Trial of all the cases on the crimi
nal docket of tlic circuit court was to*
day postponed until Thursday, April
20, with the exception of one case
which may hc tried Wednesday if the j
state's witnesses appear. This is the f
case of .Mike Dorbac. charged in two
indictments with assault with intent
to kill. Attorney Floy Abbattichio to'
the defendant appeared in court ami
asked that bin client be tried, as he
was unable to give bond and would
have to remain in jail unless his trial i
could bo arranged. Attorney Hasgert> j
for the state agreed to t.*y the case !
if his witnesses could be obtained by j
Wednesday. ;
The petit jury was excused until j
"Wednesday morning which is the time
set for this case. The civil docket was
read by acting Judge IS. M. Showal-!
ter and none of the attorneys being
ready for trial before the completion
of the criminal docket, the civil docket;
remains unchanged.
Judge W. S. Haymond- who is re-1
covering from his operation last week. !
is reported to be mending rapidly but
under the advice of the attending* phy
sicians lie will be absent from the
bench about ten days. The majority
of the cases on the criminal docket,
some of which have been previously
ruled upon by Judge Haymond. where
motions have been made, it was
thought advisable to not begin the
trial of any of these as it is not prob
able that they could be finished in the
ten days.
The trial of Mike Dorbac will .not
likely take longer than two days. The
court will remain open however until
Judge Haymond returns to hear any
business that may come up.

The attack is stated lo have been one
of the most determined of great blows
delivered slnco th battle began 50 days
ago and vet it yielded the least re
sult of any of them, although the
Crown Prince hurled two whole arms
corps against the French along a 10
, mile front.
1 As ilethincourt formed a dangerous

pected for some time and many mili

retention _ General Pet^ln^ unerrJjie
judgmeiit iii letting It go at exactly
