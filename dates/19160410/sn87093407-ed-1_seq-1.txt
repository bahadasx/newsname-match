Mmorrow of what we believe to be the ffrMt
est series of "signed talks" that any American
newspaper has yet had the fortune to print.
They are the confessions of Theda Bara, the great
screen "vampire." known in every household
from coast to coast.
QUin i* the first time Theda Bara has ever
written for any paper anywhere.
If These confessions deal with the one and only
topic that has an eternal punch—the lure of
love. These talks are handled by Miss Bara in
a way that contains nothing that smacks even
remotely of the offensive.
|J 'THINGS THAT ARE IN MV HEART," Miss
Bara calls her articles in a letter to the editor of
this paper.

14 MURDERS AMD
MOEOD Y CAUGHT!
LAST Wednesday afternoon, some one entered the home
of two old women, on Westlake ave. N., and smashed
their heads in with an ax, and stole their savings, and got
away.
Five days have elapsed since the crime was committed.
The police have made no arreits.
Murder has become one of our leading indoor sports.
A lethargic police system has permitted this. AND THE
TIME HAS COME TO PUT A STOP TO IT.
In the last three years, 14 murders have been committed
in Seattle for which nobody has been brought to justice.
Fourteen murderers have done their bloody work and have
gotten clean away! It is a disgraceful record.
Here is a list of the unsolved mysteries of the last three
years in this city. They are taken from the official records of
the King county coroner, who has pronounced all of them cases
of murder. t
Read them and ponder: '
