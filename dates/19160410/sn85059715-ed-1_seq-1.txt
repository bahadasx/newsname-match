from the American cavalry. Francis- (
co Villa is believed today to have
passed Parral and with his band,
said to numbe rover 200 men. Is reported
to be heading to Durango
City.
Detachments of the Thirteenth i:
cavalry are hard on the bandit's tTall c
but no official word hn. eomp from f
the front to indicate their position. 1
Mexican reports stated today that <
Villa has a full day ahead of his pur- I
suers. If Villa succeeds in reaching I
Durango City he probably will be j
Joined by the forces of the Arrleta t
brothers, who command more Chan J
1,000 men. '
A statement attributed to Mexican <
Consul Garcia that Villa has now es- JJ
caped any possibility of capture by "
the Americans having crossed a deadline
established by President Wilson f
and General Carranza, beyond which it
' was agreed that the American troops
would not continue their pursuit for
the bandit, was flatly denied by Mr. ,
Garcia. The Mexican consul said as t
far as he knew no limit of the Amor- ^
lean pursuit bad been agreed upon. p
Mexican officials here will not dlscuss
a report that the defacto govern- j,
ment will soon Inform the American v
government that it is in a position to
relieve the American troops of the
task of chasing Villa. B
With Villa moving into Durango the c
supply problem of the army continues p
to the fore. Heavy shipments to pri- 7
vate contractors in Chihuahua City
probably will be made from El Paso 11
in a few days. Granting the use of the d
telegraph and telephone lines by the p
defacto government to General Pershing
will be of aid in ordering and p
shipping supplies. b
