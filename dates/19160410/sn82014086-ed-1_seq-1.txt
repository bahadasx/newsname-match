soon after the outbreak of the epi
Cemic and who were recently released

According to the released officers,
there are 15,000 and sometimes more
prisoners in the camp, which the com

ana a nair acres. There were no
proper heating arrangements and the
men were insufficiently clothed. Many
had neither boots nor socks. There
was an insufficient supply of water
and soap and Major Priestley says he

GERMAN DENIAL OF
SINKING OF SUSSEX
Naxi Step By United States Will Be
Determined Within 43 Hours.
Washington, April 9. The adminis
iration expects to be in a position
within the next 43 hours to determine
what shall be the next step in the
United States in the situation re
sulting from the numerous disasters
which recently have overtaken mer
chant ships carrying American citi
zens. Secretary Lansing said tonight he
had not received official confirmation
or press despatches announcing Ger

pects to receive a number of affidavits
obtained from survivors of the Sus
sex by the American embassies in
London and Paris.
With these affidavits and official
word that Germany denies resnonsi
bility In the Sussex case before it, the
administration will be able quicklv to
determine the course the United
States shall pursue.
All the available evidence will be
considered by the president and his
cabinet Tuesday.
While official expression of opinion
was withheld, it was strongly Intimat-
u tonignt that high officials regarded
as doubtful whether the United
States could take action in the case
of the Sussex in view of the German

GEN. PERSHING REPORTS
Supplies Have Been Purchased In
Chihuahua No Disposition On Part
of Storekeepers to Withhold Their
Goods.
San Antonio, Texas. April 9-. The
Mexican military authorities have of
fered the American punitive expedi
tion the use of Mexican telegraph and
telephone lines, according to General
Pershing's report to General Fuftston
today. The ofi'er was made to the
aviators who landed in Chihuahua
last week.
General Pershing's report did not
pass over ihe telegraph lines, how
ever, but was transmitted via aero
plane and wireless routes to Colum
bus. The report was sent from some
part of the field of operations, the lo
cality of which was withheld here.
Aeroplane Drivers Courteously Treat
ed. The drivers of the aeroplanes that
visited Chihuahua said that they had
been treated courteously by General
Gutierrez, commanding officer at Chi
huahua, after it was demonstrated
(hev had come on a friendly mission.
although before that fact was determ
ined by the alarmed public, a few
stones had been thrown at thm and
a shot or two fired. No one was in
jured. Suoplies Purchased in Chihuahua.
General Pershing said some sup
plies had been purchased in Chihua
hua and that there appeared to be no
disposition on the part of those with
stores to withhold their goods, but
hot the limited amount of supplies at
Chihuahua at present made it almost
impossible to get provisions.
Position of Troops Withheld.
The present position of the advanc
ed columns was not made public, but
it was known that cavalry columns
under Colonels Brown and Dodd are
driving south from Stevo with all
speed. Officers here had no inform
ation that either force had gone as
far as Parral. but they said the re
ceipt of such information would Tie no
surprise. General Pershing himself
is moving south along the trail to
Satevo, personally directing so far as
possible the pursuit oj Villa and the
pearch of the mountains and plains
adjacent to the trails being followed.
Before leaving his headquarters on
the San Geronimo ranch north of
Guerrero, General Pershing said Gen
eral Luis Herrera, the Carranza sm
eral whose defection was reported at
one time, called upon him and tne two
discussed in a friendly manner the ef
forts being made by both, govern
ments to run down the common en
emy.
Excellent Work By Aeroplanes.
The excellent work done by the aer
oplanes has been so marked that at
headquarters officials are anxiously
n waiting reinforcements of that arm of
the service. Although It is now rec
ognized that the machines being used
are not of the type to give the best
service, General Pershing's reports In
dicate that the five still In servica are
doing good work both In scouting and
carrying despatches. It has been due
to them that General Pershing has
been able to keep in communication
at all with the fast moving cavalry
detachments.
Rcrorts at headquarters show that
a few arrests have been made of
those who took part In the raid on
Columbus. X. 51., a month ago topay.
General Pershing, who reported the
arrests, did not indicate where they
were made.
Brilliant Operations.
General Funston and his staff were
keenly appreciative of the brilliant
extension of operations in Mexico but
frank admission was made that with
out the use of the railroads, a mate
rial strengthening of the forces or the
establishment of a new base and line
of communication, the movement In
to Mexico could proceed but a short
distance further unless the advanced
forces cut loose from their base. Hope
that permission to use the railroads to
Chihuahua yet may be secured had
not been abandoned. If that permis
sion is denied, however, it is not prob
able that General Funston will Im
mediately, insist on using more troops
but it Is believed that he probably will
suggest to the war department the
movement of the line of communi
cation to some point where the base
will be much nearer to the field of op
eration. LITTLE SICKNESS AMONG
GEN. PERSHING'S COMMAND.
Less Than the Average Sick Rate for
Field Service.
Washington, April 9. Members of
the army medical corps are gratified
over reports from tho hospital base at
Kort Bliss regarding the small per
centage of sickness among the men
