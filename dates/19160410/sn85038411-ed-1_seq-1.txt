Bishop Tells Thrilling
Story of Escape From
Kaiser's Cruiser Emden
How with scores of sleepless fellow
passengers he peered anxious-eved
into the darkness from the deck of the
British steamship "Fooksang," while
the quick-eared wireless man waited
breathlessly with open key for the
first "tip" of the whereabouts of the
grim "Emden," the Kaiser's one-time
Indian ocean commerce raider, is only
one of the thrilling tales that the
Rev. Dr. W. P. Eveland, bishop of the
Methodist Church, and a missionarv
to Asia, told his Hariisburg friends to
day.
The Bishop is a native of Harris
burg but for the last four years ho has
been busy at his station in India. For
a few days Dr. and Mrs. Eveland are
guests of Mrs. J. Austin Brandt, of
CO3 North Front street, a sister of Mrs. j
Eveland. The Eveland's real taste j
of the world war was had when the i
"Fooksang" was cautiously ploughing;
its way, with deck and port lights
darkened, toward Calcutta. And lust
before dawn, as the "Fooksang" slip
ped into the port, the dim gray sh:ipe I
of the "Emden" appeared in the dis- j
tant offing and a shell whistled across '
the "Fooksang's" bows.
