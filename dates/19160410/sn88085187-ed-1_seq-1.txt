No substantial opposition
to a resubstitution of the

friends to join with me.
On general principle! I am opposed t<» lhr mul
tiplication of clttba and societies. We arc over

Boniething society.

chance to be charter members, The Times is
printing right at the tail-end of this article an
application blank for membership.
I hope that <>ur good Tacoma booster. Sam
Wall, will be Hooded with applications, He de
serves such support. He has been trying to
"Lift the Curse" off the mountain, at first un
aided. His idea is one that every Tacoinan
ought to applaud and adopt.
Do your part by filling in the blank and by
