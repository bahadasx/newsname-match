WASHINGTON, April 10. With

conventions almost in sight, repub
lican and democratic leaders have
commenced to "speed up" the gen

sional leaders are working hard to
get congress out of the way noon

his recent republican critics. Then
on Saturday night he will make an
other talk in Nw York city before

Doth speeches are looked forward
to with great interest by the demo
crats, inasmuch as they are expected

president expects will be exploited in
the St. Louis platform and later on
the stump.
While the president Is paving the
way for the opening of his nght for
reelection, tho big right in the re
publican party for nomination
honors will take shape. Informal
conferences are to be continued this
week between the managers of the
avowed middle western presidential
aspirants at which the offensive and
defensive agreement to force the
nomination of a man from that sec
tion will be perfected. With Col.

many's official denial that a Ger
man submarine attacked the chan
nel liner Sussex, was expected to
reach the state department some
time today. As a result of this
denial definite action by the United
States to bring the submarine con
troversy to a head has been serious-
i ly complicated by the positions
taken by the rival belligerents.-
England and France specifically
have declared the vessel was tor
pedoed. Germany sys that none of
her U baats was responsible. There
is no conclusive evidence from an in
dependent source that will permit of
the United States reaching a verdict.
No Action Soon.
Officials said that it was unlikely
that an:' action could be taken for
several days Inasmuch as the text of
all the affidavits taken by the em
bassy representatives in I'aris am
London cannot reach here before
next Thursday when the steamer St

It had been expected that this evi
dence would be ready for considera-j
tion at tomorrow's cabinet meeting, ,
but it was explained at the state de- '
partmer.t today that this would be j
impossible. j
It is expected that the Sussex wilL
