WASHINGTON. April 9.' The house
naval sub-committee on appropria
tions will begin tomorrow on framing
the naval appropriation bill which in
cludes me administrations nnu on-
lion dollars five year program tor new
fighting ships. Chairman Padgett
hopes to lay the complete measure
before the house by April 25.
While there are many legislative j
things in the bill which will require
debate in the sub-committee and later
before the full committee the bis fight
is expected to come over the 1917
program for capital ships. Secretary
Daniels has recommended -the au
thorization of two dreadnaughts and
two battle cruisers. The navy general
l-.oard contended for three battle ships
:ind four battle cruisers.
Present indications are that the sub
committee will compromise between
the two views and recommend two
battleships and four hattle cruisers.
At the navy department work on
the designs of the new ships to be
authorized has progressed so rapidly
that much of the delay heretofore ex
perienced in advertising for navy
craft will be eliminated. Plans for
the battleships, large and small sub
marines, destroyers, gunboats, hospi
tal ships and ammunition ships are
nearly completed now. It will take
. ,on!v a few weeks after appropriation
for the vessels Is made to lav speci
fications before private builders.
Plans for the battle cruisers and
scout cruisrs are also under way
but will take t-ome time to complete.
These vessels and the 800 ton class
submarines which Secretary Daniels
has added to his program are new
.types for navy designers and it takes
time to work out details.
An illustration of the problems in
volved became known today Tn regard
to designs for the scout cruisers. The
geperal board fixed thirty knots an
hour ps the minimum speed for these
eyes of the fleet.
Since designers tcok up the task of
planning the ships, however, they have
hit upon a way to produce bs knots

Ten Acre German Prison
Camp Hot-Bed Of Disease
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, April 9. The government
committee on the treatment in Ger
many of British prisoners of war of
which the Hon. Justice Tounger is
chairman, has issued a report on the
conditions prevailing in the Witten
berg camp during the typhus epi
demic of last year.
The report is based on information
from repatriated prisoners and es
pecially from Major Priestley, Cap
tain Vidal and Captain Lauder of
the army medical corps who were
sent to the camp shortly after the
outbreak of the epidemic and ivho
were recently released from Germany.
The three officers are the only sur
vivors of six British doctors sent to
the Wittenberg camp by the Ger
mans, "to take up," says the report
"the place of duty abandoned by their
own medical staff when the presence
of typhus manifested itself."
The records of the epidemic kept
by' the British officers were taken
from them before their departure from
Germany but the report gives in de
tail the condition of the camp and
the treatment of prisoners and pa
tients, which the American Ambassa
dor, James' W. Gerard, in his report
last November said "was more un
favorable than I had been Jed to ex"
pect."
According to the released officers,
there are 15,000 and sometimes more
prisoners in the camp, viTlich, the
committee says, "is an enormous pop
ulation for so restricted an area as
ten and a half acres." There were no
proper heating arrangements ant? the
men were insufficiently clothed, their
overcoats having been taken from
them, their clothing being in rags.
Many had neither boots nor socks.
There was an Insufficient supply of
water and soap, and Major Priestley
says he found, the men "gaunt, of a
peculiar gray pallor and verminous."
The supply of food also was insuf
ficient, even in the hospitals until
pupplies arrived from England.
"The only provision for personal
cleanliness made for the men," says
the report, "was one cup full of soft
soap issued at intervals of many,
weeks to a room containing 120. In

er Adamaton, 2,304 tons, has been sunk.
Lloyd's announces that the British
steamer Avon, 670 tons, has been sunk.
The Danish steamer Asger Hyg has
been sighted to the south of the Isle of
Wight in a badly damaged condition.
It is supposed that she has been tor
pedoed. She is a steamer of 1,14)1 tons
built in 1902 and owned in Copenhagen.
An attempt to hold a non-conscription

militant suffragette, was prominent
among the promoters. After the pro
cession had been dispersed, the leaders
in the movement mounted the plinth
of the Nelson column and endeavored
to make speeches but the crowd pelted

ingly verminous and that condition,
coupled with cold and want of proper
nourishment, was undoubtedly the
principal inducing cause of the epi
demic. "The epidemic broke out in De
cember 1914," says the report. "There
upon the German staff, military and
medical, precipitately left the camp
and thenceforth, until August 1915, no
communication was held between the
prisoners and their guards except by
means of direction shouted from the
guards or officers remaining outside
the wire entanglements.
"All supplies for the men were
pushed into the camp over chutes. No
medical attention during the whole
time was provided by the German
staff."
Captain Lauder reports that in the
bungalows there was no water sup -
ply and in the hospitals there was no
mattresses.
"In consequence," he says, "there
were many typhus patients scattered
over the compounds who were de
termined not to come into the hospital
if they could help it."
In one compound, he found fifty
hidden cases of typhus during the
first month.
"The food ration for each patient

was believed to be nearing Cape Henry

early today off Cape Hatteras. The

Evacuation of Bethincourt
Salient, Projecting Like
Wedge into German Lines,
Carried Out Without In
terference from Enemv
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
The Bethincourt salient .which for
weeks had projected like a-wedge into
the German lines northeast of Verdun
has been evacuated by the French.
The evacuation was carried out un
der cover of darkness and without in
terference and the French, through the
move, have been enabled to straighten
out their line which now runs from the
corner of the Avocourt wood to the
south, crossing Bethincourt-Esnes and
Bethincourt-Chattancourt roads.
V iolent attacks delivered by the Ger
mans against the new positions found
the French line unwavering and all of
them were repulsed, except between
Avocourt wood and the Forges brook,
where the Germans succeeded in en
tering the French trenches, but were
almost immediately driven out.
Northeast of Verdun, around Pepper
hill and on the Douaumont-Vaux sec
tor, the Germans have bombarded
French positions but were unable to
launch an infantry attack in the face
of the fire of the French guns. The
capture of 150 metres of German
trenches southwest of Douaumont is
reported by Paris.
On the rest of the lines in France and
Belgium artillery duels alone have been
in progress.
The offensive of the Russians against
the Germans in northwest Russia has
simmered down to mutual bombard
ments and bombing attacks by the Ger
man and Russian aviators. Artillery

PARIS, April 9. The capture by
French troops of about 150 metres of
a German trench southwest of Douau
mont village northeast of Verdun was
announced by the war office this af
ternoon. Progress in communicating
trenches south of the village also was
reported.
The French evacuated the Bethin
court salient Saturday night and the
Germans today attacked with great vi
olence their new line from Avocourt
to Cumiers, but were repulsed with
sanguinary lasses.
Only at one point, north of Avocourt,
did the Germans succeed in entering
the French trenches, and from this po
sition they were immediately ejected
through a counter-attack, according to
the French official communication is
sued tonight.
The communication says:
In the Argonne our artillery concen
trated its fire on the enemy's communi
cations. Our heavy batteries during
these operations shelled a sector in the
neighborhood where important troop
gatherings and columns on the march
were observed in the region of Mont
faucon and Nantillois. Near Hill 2S5
we exploded a mine which crumbled the

kitchen and as it was brought in
open wooden tubs it was full of dust
and dirt.
"In truth," says the committee's re
port, "the ration was not a ration at
all. It was a pretense. It was not
even possible to give the patients
warm water with their milk."
Four British doctors wtre infected
and three died. It was then Major
' Priestlf y and Captain Vidal went to
the hospital to join Captain Lruider
who was down with the typhus. Ma
jor Priestley says that the patients
alive with vermin, lay so close to one
another on the floor that he had to
stand straddle legged across them to
t examine them.
There were other conditions that
are indescribable. There was diffi
culty in obtaining sufficient drugs
j and dressings for a long time and
extreme bed sores were common. In
sevcraL cases the toes or the whole
foot became gangrenous. The wash
ing of patients was out of the ques
tion until a' supply of soup was ob
tained from England.
The shortage of necessaries was not
due to lack of supplies, the doctors
say, for on ft visit to the town they
saw an abundance of every requisite.
Dr. Aschenbach, who was In charge
of the hospital and who, the commit
tee understands, received the iron

her passengers as soon as the sea mod
erated. The message indicated that the
Guajara had been in a collision:
The coast guard cutter Onondaga,
which had been cruising off the Vir
ginia Capes, started for the crippled
steamer early in the day.
From a private wireless message sent
by one of the Sixaola's passengers it
appears that the Guajara summoned
help by the use of her steam whistle,
signalling in the Morse code that she
had fourteen feet of water in her hold.

WORD COMING
FROM GERMANY
Official Confirmation of
Teutonic Disclaimer of
Responsibility for Explo
sion Damaging Sussex lias
Not Been Received
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 9. The ad
ministration expects to be in a position
within the next forty-eight hours to de
termine what shall be the next step of
the I'nited States in the situation ris
ing from the numerous disasters which
recently have overtaken merchant
ships carrying American citizens.
Secretary Lansing said tonight h
had "not received official confirmation
of press dispatches announcing Ger
many's disclaimer of responsibility for
the explosion which damaged the Sus
sex, lie expects definite wuru ol some
kind tomorrow. At the same time he
expects to receive a number of affi
davits secured from survivors of tho
Sussex by the American embassies in
London and Paris.
With the affidavits and official word
that Germany denies responsibility in
the Sussex case it is indicated that the
administration will be able quickly to
determine the course the I'nited States
shall pursue.
All available evidence will be consid
ered by the president and his cabinet
Tuesday.
While official expression of opinion
was withheld it was strongly intimated
tonight that high officials were of the
opinion that it was doubtful at this
time whether action could be taken by
the United States in the case of Ilia
Sussex in view of the German denial.
Especial attention now is being di
rected at the actWn of evidence re
garding other cases which the I'nited
States has been investigating. Of
these the case of the Manchester En
gineer appeared to be the most aggra
vating. The evidence shows that at
least one of the survivors from that
ship swears he saw the periscope of a
submarine. Whether this declaration
has been corroborated is unknown, tin-
administration not being disposed to
divulge the evidence collected.
Secretary I-ansing at his home today
studied many documents and telegrams
regarding the Sussex and other cases.
A number of telegrams from Ambassa
dor Gerard, all described as being high
ly confidential, have been received, but
Air. Lansing declined to discuss any
them. Among the documents are
number dealing with the Sussex and
the Manchester Engineer as well
the cases of the Englishman, Eagle
Point and Berwindale, all of which, the
evidence thus far secured indicates,
were attacked by German submarines.
and which the German government has
been asked about.
In the case of the Eagle Point tin
evidence is said to show that the ship
upon capitulating at the end of a chase
by a German submarine was torpedoed
with members of the crew still on
board. The position of the American
government is now and always has
been that when a vessel trying to capit
ulate she gains immunity from further
attack.
President Wilson also worked on tne
submarine question today in spite of a
cold he caught Friday night when the
naval yacht Mayflower on which he
was riding down the Potomac river, ran
into a severe snowstorm.
Whatever may be the result of the
present situation between the United
States and Germany, hints have come
to the state department that the con
tinuing attacks on unarmed merchant
men will cause all belligerents and
probably some neutral merchant ships
to carry guns when voyaging through
the war zone.
When final official word from Berlin
on the Sussex Case is received the
state department will decide whether
to inquire at Vienna whether an Aus
trian submarine attacked her.

10 L PASO, Tex., April 9. General
Inez Salazar, one of the best known
f the former Huerta generals, who
has been living here, was reported
tonight to have crossed the border
with the announced intention of tak
ing up arms against the I'nited
States. The information was given
to the police by a man who wa.i
closely associated with Salazar and
was accepted by them as true, after
investigation.
The man who gave the police their
information said that some time ago
Salazar received a letter from Gen-i
eral Carranza offering him a com-
ma ml in the field. It was as the !
result of this letter, he said, that I
ilazar decided to return to Mexico.
General Salazar first came into no -

ico. Later he joined Madero but de- j
serted his cause to enlist under j
Orozco when the latter revolted.:
When Huerta came into power Sala-
z.ir was one of his most successful i
field commanders. He was. how- i
ever, defeated by Villa at Parral and '
later came to the United States. He ;
was arrested here and tried three
times on charges of conspiracy
against American neutrality, per
jury and gun-running. lie was ac
quitted each time.
When the news of the Santa Ysa
bel massacre reached El Paso a mob
attempted to lynch Salazar ami he
narrowly escaped with his life. These
experiences caused him to openly ex
press the bitterest feeling against
the I'nited States.
Salazar is credited with having a
considerable following in Northern

COLI'MIU'S, April 9. American
troops in the field in Mexico will soon
be equipped with new clothing to re
place that torn into shreds in the
strain of the campaign. A consign
ment of shoes, hats, uniforms, sweaters
and other wearing apparel, valued at
$100,000 was forwarded south along the
American line of communication today.
With the clothing went a shipment of
approximately a quarter of a million
dollars in Mexican gd.o' and silver coin
to be used in paying the wages of the
soldiers, who, while in foreign service,
draw twenty per cent additional pay.
The troops have experienced difficulty
in spending American money and for
this reason Mexican coin was sent.
Much, speculation was expressed
among officers here today as to the
possibility of the establishment of a
new expeditionary base at a point east
along the border and nearer the actual
field of operations than Columbus. It
is realized that as the length of the line
of communication, now approximately
400 miles long, increases, the problem
of keeping it intact increases propor
tionately.
Persistent, rumors were current here
today that a band of Mexicans crossed
the American border at Noria about
fifty miles east of Columbus, last Wed
nesday night and went south in Mexico,
cutting fences as they went. Nothing
could be learned at military headquar
ters concerning the reports, which did
not say whether the men were Villistas
