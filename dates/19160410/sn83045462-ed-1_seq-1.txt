>c,n luuiv, .April jf.-j^igniy-seven
is a big: factor in a convention nuniberI
ing less than on* thousand delegates.
That is the way they are figuring in
New York now. The query is whether
these eighty-seven delegates will be
able to get together and vote as a unit.
If they do, it Is assumed that this vote
may determine who is to be the republican
candidate.
On the surface there would not seem
to be much prospect of a united delegation.
Too many ambitions clash, too
many selfish interests are opposed, and
too much honest diversity of opinion
exists. Against this is 'what seems to
be an overwhelming instinct of the
masses of the party to get together and
carry the state.
.It cannot be said that the experiment
of tbe presidential primary has helped
to insure that the wishes of the people
will prevail. The primary, as it exists
in New York, has been called the politicians'
primary. It is not the sort
which Justice Hughes favored when he
was governor. Yet it is a primary,
and if the masses of the voters were
not satisfied with the opportunity given
them in selecting delegates they
could have upset the whole system.
Instead, their interest in downing the
bosses proved to be languorous.
Some Gallery of Familiar Faces.
There is the same gallery of familiar
faces which have been seen in previous
national conventions. Chauncey Depew
will be there, and so will Col. M. J.
n?^.- T5- 1-1
L/au.< U L OIWIVIVII.
Professional reformers have been
gunning for Mr. Dady many years, because,
as they alleged, he is a machine
politician. Col. Roosevelt also at various
times fired a volley of blank shot
In Dady's direction. '
Col. Dady himself has a good deal of
sentiment*about being a delegate. He began
going to national conventions in 18SS.
and it is his frankly confessed ambition
to keep on going until he is gathered to
his fathers. The reformers have shown
no touch of human sympathy with this
sentiment. They have declared again and
again that if the people ever had a fair
chance they would repudiate Col. Dady.
L'nder the primary system they had the
chance, but Col. Dady goes to Chicago to
help nominate a republican candidate who
can carry the country. He has good judgment.
too. in matters of this kind.
This case is typical of many others.
Politics, under the primary system, go on
about as before. Here* and there a local
leader, or a boss, has been upset because
he got out of touch, or because a younger
boss has come up. But there has been
no wholesale retirement of the old hands,
whether they were organization men or
anti-organization men.
Delegation of Able Men.
It has to be said, too. that the delegation
is a representative one. of which
New York need not be ashamed. Elihu
Root, for obvious reasons, does not head
it. but there are other able men of national
prominence in its ranks.
The outside world lias little concern
whether Gov*. Whitman or Senator Wadsworth
is-chairman of the delegation and
thus has the advantage of getting most
frequently before the convention. It is
more apt to assume that with the republican
senator from the s^ate and the republican
governor among the delegates
at large the New York republicans have ,
a proper conception of the dignity of their
delegation and its influence in the convention.
Scanning the list of delegates, there are
many machine politicians of the oldfashioned
kind There are also some machine
men of the new-fashioned type.
The scholar in politics always has had
recognition irr- New York, and he is not
forgotten in the present delegation. 1'resident
Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia
who knows something of politics
himself, represents this element
National " Committeeman Charles TJ.
lliles is one of the district delegates
Former Secretary Stimson is another,
and there are members of Congress,
state senators and members of the state
committee.
So far as there is a line of cleavage
it Is between what is known as the organization
faction and the Whitman
syndicate. The organization faction includes
Senator Wadsworth, William
Barnes and other skillful politicians.
The Whitman syndicate is mostly composed
of up-state leaders who are equalliy
skillful. Among them are Hendricks
of Syracuse. Aldridge of Rochester and
William L. Ward of Westchester counj
ty. although Westchester might be con|
Bldered as part of Manhattan.
William Barnes to Be Considered.
There is much pother over whether or
not William Barnes shall be re-elected
as the New York member of the national
committee. The control of the
state committee also enters into the situation.
All this, naturally, is of great
concern to the New York republicans,
and the newspapers give columns of
space to it. But there is little of Interest
in these factional maneuvers for
republicans throughout the country. Jt
is simply a local family fight which can
exert no Influence on national politics,
though some of the family fighters think
otherwise.
I Judging from the turmoil and the J>itI
terness of the factions it might be
j thought thai there is no prospect of
| the eighty-seven delegates to Chicago i
getting together as a unit, since most |
of them are mixed up with one faction
or the other, but as an offset it may j
| again be said there is the widespread
feeling of the mass of the party that
| this is a get-together year in national
! politics, and any set of leaders or bosses
| who balk this aspiration is likely to be
| punished.
Presidential Preference
As to presidential candidates, the ap-j
parent division is between the support-!
' era of Justice Hughes and those who are j
[ supporting the nomination of Air. Root.
I This means that the division is between
Gov. Whitman and his syndicate on one
side, and the organization, as represented
by Senator W'adsworth and William
Barnes, on the other side. But
there are too many modifying circumstances
to permit < on' lusions to be
drawn on this point.

Immediate action for adequate prepared- j
ness is the keynote of the eleventh annual j
convention of the Navy League of the
United States, which opened its four-day
sessions this morning with nearly 1,000,
delegates present from all the states of
the Union.
Vigorous response to attacks on the
Navy League in full-page newspaper
advertisements by Henry Ford wgre'
spiritedly answered by the president j
and secretarv nf thp a ssnoia t inn whilp i
the delegates applauded. Answering
the insinuation that he personally as
head of the great nickel corporation
would profit heavily by preparedness.
Col. Thompson said that when Congress
had appropriated a million dollars for
the Navy Department to buy nickel
at $1 a pound he had sold it to the department
at 24 cents a pound,|the lowest
price for which nickel was ever
sold in the world. After a term of years
when this business was turned over to
the steel corporation he put the price
up 25 per cent and when asked why he
said he received his education from the
United States government and never
wants any profit from the government,
but that he did exact a fair rate of
profit from other business concerns.
A number of Washington men, including
three former ambassadors, by
a change of the by-laws, were unanimously
elected directors of the league.
This action was taken in furtherance
of the purpose to center the Navy
League directorate here and make the
capital the real headquarters of the
league's activities. Henry B. F. Macfarland
was chairman of the nominating
committee.
Those elected from Washington are:
David Jayne Hill, Henry White,
Thomas .1. O'Brien, all former ambassadors:
Charles D. WaJcott, secretary
Smithsonian Institution; Woodbury
Blair, whose father was Secretary of I
State in Lincoln's cabinet; William
Corcoran Eustis, William R. Merriam.
ex-governor of Minnesota: O. H. Tittmann,
former director of the coast and
geodetic survey.
Other new members are: James K.
Lynch, San Francisco: Morgan Adams.
D. Norman Bridge, Grant Stephenson.
Benjamin T. Waldo, Charles G. Curtis
and Lewis L. Clarke.
Washingtonians re-elected as directors
are: John Temple Graves, Henry H.
Ward and John Callan O'Laughlin.
Contention thai the United States has
failed to maintain the "guarantee" of the
Constitution "for common defense" and
to "protect each state against invasion"
enlivened the first day, when voiced by
David Jayne Hill, former ambassador to
Germany. He denounced the administration's
foreign policy as one which has
"caused a complete loss of our prestige
as a nation and rendered our government
a practically negligible quantify as
an international factor."
Prominent Men on Program.
Some of the country's foremost au- I
thorities on international law, commerce
and military and naval science are on
the program to participate in a symposium
of authorllative views on just what !
constitutes adequate preparedness for
national defense. /
"To the Bryans. Henry I^ords, Jordan?,
Tavenners et al., we are anathema,"
said Col. Robert M. Thompson, president
of the league, in his address of welcome.
While the league has "earned the hatred
of that class which is opposed to preparedness.
we trust you will love us for
these enemies we have made." he said.
The league was founded by men. Col.
Thompson continued, who "believed
that an efficient and adequate fleet was
the best defense against invasion. He
asserted that this country has awakened
to the necessity of a real preparedness
for defense.
"England is spending millions of dol- !
lars a day." said Col. Thompson, in conclusion,
"because she failed to spend
thousands at the proper time. In the
face of such possibilities, why waste
time over trifles; taxes or bonds, either
or both, take your choice, but decide;
'he gives tw ice who gives quickly.' "
Report of Secretary Dadmun.
The public's growing interest in preparedness,
and especially the naval
phase of preparedness, is emphasized j
in the report of Arthur H. Dadmun, the
secretary, presented at the business !
session. This shows that whereas J
financial receipts were *9,000 in the !
year ending March 31, 1911, the revenue
of the league for the year ending
March 31. 191G, was about $60,000. The
report shows a steady but compara- j
tively slow increase during the years
1911 to 1915. inclusive, but, probably
due to the lessons of the European war,
the income for the fiscal year just ended
was nearly four times that of the
previous year.
Considerably more than half of the
total revenue, says the report, was derived
from memberships. In this connect
ion the report shows that the active
membership totals 13,000 and the
associate membership more than
210,000.
The report hits at Henry Kord with
the following paragraph:
"The organization has recently received
a high compliment as to the
effectiveness or us campaign ror a
stiong: navy. Mr. Henry Ford is said
lo have provided a fund of millions for
a full page newspaper advertisement
V "*1
i %..k jm.
?L
containing mendacious insinuations
against the league."'
Thinks Public Needs Education.
In presenting "Our Purpose" Henry
H. Ward of Boston, vice president of
the league, said that previous to its
organization "there seemed to be no
serious public convictions in regard to
the mission of the navy."
"Before the American lawmakers and
the administrators of this government
there are responsibilities today greater
than they have ever faced before." declared
Mr. Ward. "The Navy League
proposes that these responsible officers
shall have the organization's full support
in all they do to seize the opportunities.
but unsparing condemnation
should they fail or should party or Individual
consider profit."
This address was followed by a business
session for the election of officers
and directors.
That the United Slates is in reality
occupying fourth place among the nations
in relative naval strength, and
that "the American navy has practically
no effective scouts and is woefully
weak iri all unarmored vessels." was
the contention of Sidney Ballon, former
jusTice of the supreme court of Hawaii,
presiding over the afternoon session.
Address of Dr. Prince.
A naval policy for the United States
similar to that of Great Britain,
whereby this country would maintain
a fleet in strength equal to the combined
fleets of any two probable foes.
Great Britain excepted, was recommended
in an address by I >r. Morton
Prince, professor in Tufts' t'ollcge,
Medford, Mass., who has just returned
from studying conditions iti Kurdpe.
Dr. Prince pointed, to the possibility of
this nation being called upon at some
not distant date to meet attack by
these two powers jointly.
"Th?* history of Kngland's work in
nrenaredness." said Dr. Prince, "illus
trails the policy we should adopt. As
England was on land so are we today,
though even less prepared."
L>r. Hill in speaking; on "The "Essential
Elements of American Policy" vigorously
denounced the policy which has
"caused a complete loss of our former
prestige as a nation and rendered our
government a practically negligible
quantity as an international influence.
Dr. Nevil Monroe Hopkins will deliver
an ilustrated lecture tonight in the
ballroom of the Willard on "The Making
of a Navy." Col. Thompson, the
president of the league, will entertain
the officers and speakers at dinner tonight
in his residence, on Sheridan
circle.
The convention will he in session

will include a banquet Wednesday
night and a trip to the Naval Academy,
in Annapolis, on Friday afternoon.

DR. A. W. WAITE ENTERS
A-PLEA OF NOT GUILTY
?
| Dentist Pale and Silent During Ar!
raignment on Charge of Slaying
Father-in-Law.
I
i NEW YORK. April 10.?Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite, who has confessed to
poisoning his father-in-law, John E.
Peck, millionaire drug manufacturer of
Grand Rapids, Mich., entered through
his counsel today a plea of not guilty,
| when arraigned on the indictment
I charging him with murder in the first
; degree. His counsel, however, reserved
[ the right to change the plea within ten ]
days. ]
District Attorney Swann consented to '
I this arrangement and Dr. Waite was
committed to the Tombs, without bail,
to await trial. No date was set for the
j trial.
I The arraignment required only two
minutes and l>r Waite spoke no word,
but stood, pale and quiet, gazing at the
floor. It was apparent that he had not
fully recovered from his recent illness,
j caused by the drugs he took the day
before his arrest.
The prisoner was weak, too, from the
strain of his experience preceding his
; arraignment. He had been removed
! from the observation ward of Bellevue
| Hospital, where, he had been confined
since his arrest, in an automobile
j driven by his brother, Frank Waite.
Crowd Gathers to See Him.
Persons crowded the sidewalks to
j watch him walk from the hospital door
' to the machine.
Before the machine started off Dr.
Hki'U
Waite consented to pose for a moment
for moving picture photographers.
The. trip to the criminal courts building
was interrupted by a visit to police
headquarters. .There Dr. Waite was
photographed while his finger prints
and measurements were taken. He declined
to talk to newspaper men.
Before being arraigned Dr. Waite
was taken into the district attorney's
office for a conference with his counsel,
Walter R. Deuel, and a prosecutor's assistant.
it was explained after the plea was
entered that the reservation of the
right to change it was a formality, inasmuch
as under the law the court cannot
accept a plea of guilty on a charge
of first-degree murder.
After Dr. Waite had been taken to
the Tombs he was placed in an observation
cell.
STREET CAR STRIKE ENDS.
Toledo Companies Grant Increase of
Pay to Their Employes.
TOLEDO, Ohio, April 10.?For the first
i line in iiuiiccii u?j\ a mis cn> luuay naa
street car service. All the cars were
started at 7:30 this morning. On each
car there was posted a notice that beginning
immediately cash fares will be
5 cents and tickets will be sold at the
rate of six for 25 cents. The three-cent
rate, which has been effective from 5:30
to 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., is
abolished.
During the entire tie-up there was no J
violence.
The formal agreement between the To- I
ledo Railways and Light Company and i
the Amalgamated Association of Street i
and Electric Railway Employes was ratified
last night at a mass meeting of the
car men. The men are denied the privilege
of wearing union buttons.
The men receive an immediate increase
in wages of 3 cents an hour. The new
maximum for experienced men is 30
cents an hour. In 1917 they will receive
31 cents and in 1918 32 cents. It is possible
for the company to increase fares without
consent of the city, as it has no franchise
and can fix its own rates.
WARSHIPS TO ASSEMBLE.
Preparation* Made at Hew York for
Gathering of Powerful Fleet.
NEW YORK, April 10.?Preparations
are being made at the New York navy
yard for the arrival of the largest and
most powerful fleet of warships ever

destroyers, seven submarines and several
tenders. The warships are to remain
at the navy yard from two weeks
to two months undergoing repairs.

today on border reports that
an agreement between W ashington
and the Carranza government
had fixed a "dead-line" beyond
which the American troops would

Secretary Baker declared in answer to

Little Known of Protocol.
The proposed protocol, of which little
lias become known, still is under discussion
at Gen. Carranza's provisional capital,
Queretaro. Special Agent Rodgers
left the provisional capital for Mexico
City last week, but expects to return to
Gen. Carranza's headquarters soon, when
the negotiations will be resumed.
At both the State and War departments
it was said nothing was known of
reports of massing of Carranza troops on
Gen. Pershing's rear. State Department

Secretary Baker plans to leave tonight
for a brief visit to his home at
Cleveland. He intends to return Wednesday.
Carranza Officials Anxious.
State Department dispatches today indicate
that officials of the Mexican de
facto government are viewing with
some anxiety the continued presence of
American troops in Mexico.* One dispatch
authoritatively was described today
as containing a hint that certain
Mexican officials believed the purpose '
of the American punitive expedition
had been accomplished. This belief'
was said to be based upon the as- I
sumption that the bandits under Villa 1
have been dispersed.
Consul General Rodgers. it was learned
today, has advised the department that j
the de facto government officials at Quere- ;
taro had intimated to him they would like !
to know how long the United States in- i
tended to keep the troops in Mexico. Ad- i
I ministration officials in a position to be 1
| familiar with the Mexican situation said '
! the de facto government had not set a I
date upon which they thought the American
troops should be withdrawn. It was
I <tumiiieu in various quarters. However,
Ithat such action by the dc facto govern|
ment would not be surprising,
j Dispatches from consuls in various secJ
tions of Mexico described conditions generally
as being goo.l.
Dispatches From Funston.
Overnight dispatches from (Jen. FunI
ston to the War Department, made
public by Secretary Baker today, were J
summarized in the following state-}
ment:
"The latest dispatch from (Jen. Persli- |
ing, dated April 8."explains infrequency ;
of communication by saying that the
wireless has not been able to work, and |
aeroplane communication has been i
difficult because of lack of suitable !
landing places.
"The dispatch again confirms the ,
early report of Villa being severely I
wounded in the rig^t knee.
"Gen. Pershing reports that he has (
had a very satisfactory conference i
with Gen. Ferrera and expects today j
to meet Gen. Gutierrez, to whom he j
sent messages by aeroplane to Chi- I
huahua, and received back replies of- j
fering full co-operation. Gen. Persh- !
ing's comment is that every Indication !
shows the desire of the troops of the de t
facto government to aid to the extent
of their ability.
Railroad Situation Improved.
"uenerai reramug iurtiier reports that
one aeroplane was badly disabled in landing
April 6. leaving only live out of the
original eight now in serviceable condition,
but it is evident that the aeroplanes
in use are performing valuable, if not in- |
dispensable, service and that great reli-L
ance is placed upon them." 7.
Secretary Baker received word today j
that the railroad situation in Mexico
was much improved and that supplies ,
in increasing quantities were going ,
forward to the American troops in
Mexico. He informed the .President
that all reports from the border indi- 1
cated the Carranza forces were co- (
operating in the pursuit of Villa.
Secretary Baker said he had no in- 1
formation regarding El Paso rumors 1
that Carranza troops were being mob- :
ilized along the American line of com- <
munication. He also declared Gen. ;
Funston had not indicated need for 1
additional troops, either in Mexico or 1
for the border patrol, beyond the new j
recruits recently authorized bv Con - J,
gress to fill the border regiments. j j
Supplies Are Being Shipped. j j
l.arge quantities of supplies are ap- I j
parently being shipped on the Mexican
Northwestern railway from El Paso by '
private shippers, ultimately destined
for Gen. Pershing. Secretary Eaker
3tated.
Such supplies will be bought by Gen.
Pershing's commissary department. Another
train load of forage, canned
goods and other supplies is reported to
have left Juarez.

ATTITUDE OF CARRANZA

; Says Troops Have Crossed Dead Line
A statement attributed to Mexican
Consul Garcia that Villa has now escaped
any possibility of capture by the
| Americans, having: crossed a dead line
i established by President Wilson and
I Gen. Carranza beyond which it was
j agreed that the American troops would
not continue their pursuit for the nanI
dit, was flatly denied by Mr. Garcia.
? The Mexican consul said, as far as he
f knew, no limit of the American pursuit
J had been agreed upon.
Mexican officials here will not discuss
a report that the de facto government
will soon inform the American government
that it is in a position to relieve
lie American troops of the task of
I chasing Villa.
More Troops Expected in Juarez.
j Gen.1 Petronillo Hernandez with forces
variously estimated at from 1,000 to
! 3.000 men is expected to arrive in
[Juarez today to take over the military
I command of the town from Gen. Gavira.
according to information from Mexican
sources. According to the same sources.
(Jen. Gavira will go to Casas Grandes.
where he will be assigned to a field
command.
The constant maneuvering of Carranza
troops between points close to
the border is a favorite topic of discussion
on street corners, in hotel lobbies
and other places where men congregate.
but as the Mexican officials
here and in Juarez refuse to discuss the
matter or give evasive answers to all
questions the subject remains one of
.ilmos* pure speculation.
It is known that the movements have
been closely watched by government
troops along Hie border and that frequent.
rep??rts arc being made to Washington
but federal officials profess to be as much
in the dark as any one else in regard Pi
the meaning of these troop movements.
May Ask for Withdrawal.
One explanation which was offered today
by an American who was formerly
in close touch with the Mexican government
found many accepters. This man
said be believed Gen. 1'arranza was pre
paritig to take advantage of the clause
in the agreement with Washington ovoi
the Villa pursuit which provides that the
American troops would withdraw as soon
as the de facto forces can cope with the
situation.
"If Carranza can mass 25,000 or
30.000 soldiers in northern Chihuahua
and Sonora, ' he said, "he can contend
with a good show of reason that lie is
in a position to handle any number of
men Villa can collect and give protection
to the border also. It is not easy
to see what reply Washington could
make except to order the withdrawal
of the expeditionary force." >
With Villa moving into Durango. the
supply problem of the arniv continues
to the i'ore. Heavy shipments to private
contractors in Uhihuahua city
probably will be made from El Paso
in a few days. Granting the use *>f
the telegraph and telephone lines by
the de facto government to Gen. Pershing
will be of aid in ordering and
shipping supplies.
Mystery Over Salazar Departure.
There is considerable mystery over
the reported crossing of the border bv
Sen. Ynez Salazar. the former Huerta
general, who has been living here and
who is said to have gone into Mexico
with avowedly hostile intentions toward
the United States.
The story of the crossing was told
the police by a man who had been
closely associated vwith Salazar. An
investigation was made and later the
[police announced they believed the
story to be true. Mrs. Salazar was
questioned and said her husband was
nvay from home, but she did not know
where be was. She denied, however,
that he had entered Mexico.
In the meantime a proclamation was
liscovered purporting to be signed by
Salazar, in which he called on all
patriotic Mexicans to join him in the
protection Mexican soil. Elfego

to the proclamation was unieniably
