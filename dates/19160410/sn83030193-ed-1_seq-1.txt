no reports of trouble For the llrs!
tlmo in two weeks, tho contrac'ots
made a real cITort to resumo work.
About two thousand "sand hogs" and
shorers went down Into the wot kings,
out of tbo full quota of ten thous.ip.il
required. J
At thd head of the Old Slip shaft
of the Hast ltlvrr tunnel there were
ono hundred men waiting for work
for which 500 are required. Major
O'Hourko of tho Fllmt-O'Iiourkc
Company, tho lost of whoso tunnel

"We would not hesitate to till th- ,

Hugh Franey of tho American

union tho contract was broken by
tho contractors when they required
their men to work more than six
hours ut a shift under nn air pressure
of twenty-two pounds.
Frank X. Sullivan, counsel for the
