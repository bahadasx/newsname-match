two army corps in dense masses
against the French positions north

at least a division and a half,
charged the line between Avooourt
and Belhincourt. They were ap

French trenches and seemed In

of their men were falling tyy tbe

courage and the weight of their

~ATTAGK3B&.
By the withdrawal of forces
from the daagenmsljr expoeed

behind tbe village, two fresb divi
sions attacked Dead Man's H^ljU
wlille the assault was in progreas on
the Bethincourt line, the otber
forces at the same time trying, to
slip tlirougb the ravine near
Cum teres. To aid the maneuver,
an attack was simnltaneously made
on the east bank of the Mease in
the region of ChanHneuvllle. a*d
Vacherauville. The few hundred
men who had succeeded in .pene
trating the ravine were left on tbe
field after the action proved un
successful. A third attack at the
same time was delivered on the po
sition strongly organised by the
French northeast of Avooourt, the
object seemingly being to drive in
the French line far enough to tarn
Hill 404. which lies 800 yards south
and constitutes what Is character
ized as the Gibraltar in the Frenc]
lines in that district. This attack
met Mitli more success than the oth
ers. but after the Germans had
succeeded in getting a footing at
some points in the first trenches, the
French made a counter-attack, and
the net, result for the Germans was
an increase In their losses from
French bayonets.
GERMAN* IjOSSKS TERRIFIC.
It is stated authoritatively that at
the. close of the terrific day, the
French held exactly the same posi
tions aa at- the beginning of the at
tack. German losses again are said
to have been on the basis of fifty
per cent of the effective engaged.
These include a considerable por
tion of German reserves.
