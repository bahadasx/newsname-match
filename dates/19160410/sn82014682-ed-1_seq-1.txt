Ite at the end Of the present lease In 1920. which site includes some i
or 30 acres of land on which the mill, off Ices, shops and switches ajen0
situated, and'that the company would also be willing to pay an additional
I1SO.000- for ' KelcahaAValroea government landa on a 15-year lease Pf0
1ng the ownership1 of the mlllsite was a settled fact, was stated Govern,
or PInkham and territorial officials by Manager H. P. . Faye lst Friday..
The Walmea land lease expires nexi
The conference at Kekaha was, held
about noon,' and in the main office at
the big mill Through the open win
dows, as .the men , talked, came the
sweet acent of raw sugar and the hum
r -of heavy machinery. :
The conversation on both aides was
free and easy, and the question of
homesteads, water and land rights
'was discussed from some of its many
angles. ; ';.... '
Governor Aska Public Sentiment. '
Gorerncr Plnkham began the con
versation by stating that he and" his
men had come to look over the situa
tion first band: to gain every bit of
Information they could .from as many
-sources as Vo88ible.
He stated furthermore that ne is
bound down by the Organic Act, which
fcllcws that any 23 men may be heard
if they petition for homestead rights
tri a certain dlstrkt,- regardless of,
what leases the government may have
: uide-rtgaruuig it..-, --
t.et us know a a- people .what we
vYre abot". is the. plea ihe goy
erncr ruakes.- Jl has proposed that
' ' a big mass meeting :be held In the
Honolulu armory, and that there, the
land and-water , question be threshed
' out thoroughly. -. ,.' .
' . .Manager Faye is not In favor of
homesteaders taking the present land.
He declared hia willingness to ; help
the homesteaders, however, if a' sult
able policy could be reached by the
;. government. '..V- " v:''- :
RighU Very Valuable. A
, lie ' stated that he Was willing to
pay lloO.OOO'for the mauka land and
Water rights assurance of cane being
given If bis company is allowed the
t ownership of the , mill, by purchase
efter the old lease has expired. .
. . Manager Faye says he believes that
if the "Kekaha cane lands are turned
over to homesteaders Jhe result would
' be . yield of 5000 tons per year in
stead cf the present -yield of 15.000
tens. He Is sure that with ownership
by the company the yield can be in
V creased by storing more waters in
the mountains. '.
In answer to auery as to whether
" he considered it feasible f; the ter
ritory to handle the distribution and
' regulation of water for homesteaders.
! the sugar .man replied emphatically
' in the negative. :
One , homestead would claim here
and one there, he said, and regulation
would be mighty, hard." j ;
"God pity the man who is in charge
of the distribution," he said.
Kekaha -mill lawmaking as few re
pairs or" additions .to machinery rand
, . equipment as it can et along with
this in Ylew of the fact that its lease
will soon expire., '
"We" did put In one $9000 piece not
, so long ago," he said, "but this was
-because we found it absolutely neces
sary for the work of the milt For
the most part we are avoiding this."
Bound By 25-Year Rule.' .
Again Governor Pinkham spoke of
the fact 'that the Organic Act holds
him fast by its 25-year rule. f
We are between the devil and the
deep sea," he laughed.
One of the" facts brought - out by
V the conversation was that the com
pany, is making about 33,000,000-gal-,.
lona of water a day cover some 4500
.acres of cane land.
- The : noon conference came follow
ing a busy morning, the governor
and his party going from yhue in the
early morning out to Walmea, Kekaha
And across government lands as far
as the famous barking sands.
At Walmea a conference held- by
Superintendent Charles R. "Forbes
' with W. O. Crow, owner of a small
electric light f lant which supplies
light to at least 50 customers, resultflpj
in the Walmea man being added to
