THAT RED BLOODED YEARNING
Give Report
on Gasoline
Price Probe
Washington, April 10. The federal
trade commission today presented to
congress a preliminary report on its
investigation of the rise in the price
of gasoline. The report carries a
mass of statistics on production and
prices, but draws no conclusions as to
the cause of the increase of the latter.
Of alleged price discriminations,
which the commission is charged with
investigating under a senate resolu
tion,. the report says:
"If prices are found to have been
raised to higher levels in some sec
tions than others, making due allow
ance for quality of product, freight
and marketing conditions, it may be
inferred that an element of artificial
manipulation has entered into the ad
vance." One table submitted with the report
shows that tank wagon prices, higher
in the west in January, 1915, than
they were in the east, were higher a
year later in the east. The same re
lation was shown between prices in
the east and west after freight was de
ducted. Suggestions that increasing exports
have been partly to blame for higher
prices are considered in a table that
shows 1915 exports amounted to 15
per cent. Exports for the year of gas
oline, naptha and benzine totaled
2S4,500,00O gallons, against 238,500,
000 in 1914 and 188,000,000 in 1913.
