ANTI-WILSON
METING PLAN
IS REPUDIATED
Congressman Stephens De
nounces National Democrat
ic Association's Effort.
SPEAKER ALSO DISPLEASED
Nebraska Lawmakers Declines
to SpeakCalls It Folly to
Attack President.
In a letter to Lorenzo G. War
field's secretary, Congressman
Dan Stephens of Nebraska today
condemned the efforts of the "Na
tional Democratic Association' to
stage an anti-Wilson mass meeting
at the old Masonic Temple tomor
row night.
Secretary Warficld had invited
Mr. Stephens to speak at this mass
meeting, and he received a caustic
reply from the Nebraska Demo
crat. An advertisement in a local pub
lication today says that William
Sulzer, Speaker Champ Clark,
Senator Oscar Underwood, and
otHer Democrats "have been re
quested" to speak at the same
meeting.
SPEAKER NOT INFORMED.
Freaki-r Clark said today he know
nothing about the maia meeting, and
lit.- did not seem particularly pleased
that his Yiamo had been used In con
nection with, an antl-Wllaon demonstra
tion, j,
"( am entirely out of sympathy with
such a movement." said Congressman
Stephen. In -writing Mr. .Warficld.
"I consldor such a plan unjustlflod.
and Inimical to the best Interests of the
country and the Democratic party In
particular. I dannot understand the
position of a Democrat who can Join
In an attack of this sort upon n Demo
ciatlc President under whose Adminis
tration wo enacted mon reform legls
Utlon than has been enacted In a half
century.
"Why got excited and desert him now,
and contribute toward tho possible elec
tion of some man who represents poll
cle which, as a -whole, we aro not 1n
Jiccrrd with at all.
Calls It Height of Folly.
"It Is the height of folly and I can't
never be In sympathy with such a move
ment. No President can over please us
all, on all subjects at ono time.
"Christ himself could not do It so why
abandon the man who has had such sig
nal success In guiding the destinies of
the nation through such a trying period
to experiment with another. If
you really propose n Democratic move
ment for tho purpose of defeating Wood
low Wilson for renomlnatlon I ndvlie
most strongly aganst such folly, for wc
cannot win without Wilson. I nm for
Wilson before and after the convention."
The letter head of the National Dem
ocratic Association shows that Its head-
2!
uartrra are ion M street northwest,
nd that Its president Is J. W. Stac-
fci-rn, wiin Lorenzo u. wnmoia, sec
retary. Across tho top of tho letter
head are printed the three words. "Agi
tation. Education-. Organization."
District Business
Put on Side Track
House Decides Rivers and Hai-
bors Measure Is More
Important.
The rivers and harbors appropria
tion bill took precedence over District
business In the House today.
When Congressman lien Johnson
(.ought to tako up District business
according to tho calendar, It was vot
ed to take up tho rivers and harbors
budget.
The Democratic caucus recently de
termined that appropriation bills and
the Administration legislative pro
gram shall have tho right of way in
tho House.

President Has Cold;
Cancels Engagements
President Wilson, suffering
with a troublesome cold,
canceled all his engagements
today, and remained in the
White. House.
The President contracted a
slight cold on Friday. He
decided to take a river trip
in the hope he would be able
, to throw it off. Bad weather,
however, forced him to re
turn. Yesterday found him
uncomfortable. It is report
ed at the White House early
today that he is much improved.
D. C. IMS'SUIT
TO
Must Return $34,000 Under
Distinction Between Earn
ings and Receipts.
The District must return 131,563.11 In
taxes received from the Georgetown
Gas Light Company and the Washing
ton Gaslight Company, Recording to
an opinion rendered by tho District
Court of Appeals.
The District collected this sum from
the companies on the ground that It was
cntltl"u to levy 6 per cent under the act
of Congress of July, 1912, "on tho gross
earnings of gas companies In tho Dis
trict." .
The companies paid the amounts and
then appealed to tho District 8uprcmo
Court.
The onlnlon today, written bv Chief
Justice J. Harry Covington, of the Dis
trict supreme court, who served on
tile Appellate Court In tho absence of
Associate Justice Van Orsdcl, sustains
the decision of Justice Gould who heard
the case In the court below.
Chief Justice Covington' opinion de
clares the District has confused the
terms "gross earnings" and "gross re
ceipts," upholding the contention of tho
companies that they were entitled to
deduct the cost of certain raw materials
from their irross receipts before making
reiurn or me amount taxable.
The decision returns to the Wash
ington Gaslicht Com nun v th sum nt
di..i.M illegally received as part of
the 'personal tax for tho year cndlng-ln
juiic, lau. Dy tne district.
Tho Georgetown company Is entitled
to recover $3,241.49 n Its overpay
ment of taxes.
Chief Justice Covington holds that
Kruss receipts- ana "gross earnings
may constitute the same sum of
money with certain sorts of huslnens
concerns, but he rules that "It would
be an economic fallacy to assert that
the "gros receipts' of an ordinary
manufacturing concern are Its 'gross
earnings.
Tlie court cited numerous manufac
turing businesses to bear out his con-
tcntlon that there exists a difference
fetween "gross receipts" and "gross
Turnings.

In other words, the preliminary Inves

that gasolene leaves the producer until
It Is poured into the tank of an automo

Colonel" Thompson, in Opening
Address Before Convention,
Defends Program.
CHARGES ARE PERSONAL
Explains Why Steel Companies
Paid More for Nickel Than
the Government.
Denunciation of the statements of
Henry Ford published throughout tho
country as advertisements In the dally
newspapers today as utterly false and
without foundation occupied the atten
tion of the thousand-odd delegates from
a'l sections of the country to the elev
enth annual convenUon of the tXavy
League of America at their opening ses
sion at the New Wlllard Hotel this
morning.
Colonel Ucbort M. Thompson, presi
dent of the loague. Introduced the Ford
advertisement Into his address of wel
come to the delegates, by calling atten
tion to Its personal reference to him.
'l do not want to Inject Into this
convention a personal affair, but It Is
duo to the members of the league, in
tlew of the mendacious attack of Mr.
Ford, published In all sections of the
country today, the first day of our
meeting, that I mako some statement.
"Mr. Ford charges that I, as chair
man of the board of directors of the
International Nickel Company, will
profit by the program of building wa
propose for the navy. When years ago.
the use' of nickel In the armor plate of
the navy was proposed nickel was a
rare metal.
Market Price One Dollar.
"The market price of plckel was one
dollar per pound. The navy bought the
nickel Itself nnd distributed It to the
armor plate concerns. Congress appro
priated $1,000,000 to purchase one million
pounds of nickel. I sold the nickel to
the Navy Department for 24 cents per
puuuu.
"When, tome ycrs later, the Navy
Department discontinued the purchase.
rf nickel and the steel companies bought
It themselves, the prlco of nickel waa
uavanccd Z. per cent.
"Remonstrances were received from
lne steel companies.0 They charged rno
practically with an attempt to hojcftlirni
up. I told them that. I had been edu
cated br the Government of tho lTnltd
Btntcs nt the Naval Academy. I told
them that all I had. that I had beeomo
or ever expected to be was the result
of the trilnlng I had received at the
erptnse of tho Government.
"I UiH them I would never accept
n profit on anything that I sold to
tho Government. And I never did.
When tho steel companies were In
the tjarket to buy nleke), thot was
another matter and I made them pay
me a profit. '
