SEND MORE MOTORS AMD AEROPLANES
TO AID IN THE MAN-KUHT IN MEXICO
Washington, April 10. Hope of
breaking up the Vllllsta bands In
Mexico grew here today, a month af
ter tho orders to do so were Issued.
Army men thought that Major
General Fred Funston's code reports
might bring news ot Francisco Villa's
capture before the week ends. The
warm trail the United States cavalry
is following Is believed to be grow
ing warmer. When iGeneral . Per
shing's men close In, If they are In
onythlng like fresh condition, Mexico
will be rid ot Villa, experts here as
sert. The state department is probing
tho sources of rumors which tend to
prejudice rolatlons between the
United States and tho do facto gov
ernment. Despite tho usual crop of
wild reports, officials declare the Car
ranxlRtas have manifested nothing
but friendliness and a dcslro to be
of assistance In tho hunt,
Tho army transportation situation
is now under control and more auto
trucks will bo ordered If needed. But
It Is hoped that tho speedy capture of
Villa will make further purchases
unnecessary. Two more aeroplanes
will be sent to the border this week.
- "General Pershing' comments
show that there Is every Indication
that the de facto government troop
lages, It was admitted. Nevertheless,
the most terrific artillery bombard
ment In the world's history won only
a single fort, Douaumont. It Is es
timated that losses on both sides total
moro tban 200,000.
London, April 10. With not a mo
ment's lull in the fierce fighting
northwest of Verdun, the Germans
have followed up their advance at
Bethlncourt with drives against tbe
French wings, which are five mile
apart.
The battle Is becoming more furi
ous than any engagement on tbe west
bank since the smash at Verdun be
gan, advices declared today.
Doth sides' losses In Sunday's
struggle were appalling. The Ger
mans sacrificed hundreds ot men at
tempting to duplicate the ''nut
cracker" tactics by which they
squeezed the French out of Bethln
court. The Teutons hope to force evacua
tion of all outer fortifications to the
northwest.
The "nutcracker'" right Jaw broke
the French line northeast of Ato-
court wood. Immediate French
counter-attack ousted the attackers
from their hard-won gains.
At the opposite end ot the battle
front the left Jaw of the "nutcracker"
was hurled against French rank be
tween Dead Man's hill and Cnmleres.
It was heavily repulsed. Emerging
from the protection of the forest, the
Germans were caught In a withering
fire and halted in disorder before
they reached the defenders' breast
work. ,

El Paso, April 10. Reinforce

into Mexico today as If there were no
prospect of a withdrawal soon. Ac
tivities In connection with the cam
paign were speeded up. A field tele
graph had already been rushed to
Galeana.
Meantime, Francisco Villa and his
men are south of the Durarrgo state
boundary, which rumor persists In
saying is the "dead line" beyond
which Washington has promised the
United States troops shall not oper-'

Villa is at least 50 miles ahead of
the most advanced American troops,
and Is in territory so rough and wild
that it is unfavorable for swift pur
suit.
On the revival of rumors of an Im
pending withdrawal of Untted State
troops from Mexico, officials and lead
ing business men here conferred to
plan to meet any acute situation
which may develop from the activi
ties of Mexicans In El Paso and
Juarez. It is feared, also, that dis
gruntled Americans may cause
trouble. General Salaxar's where
abouts are causing Juarez officials
considerable concern. Department
of justice agents who only last Thurs
day questioned him with regard to
antl-Carranza plots have been In
formed that he crossed the border
Into Mexico with a small escort of
former Huerta adherents. It Is re
ported that Salazar Is acting as head
of tho Feliclstas In Chihuahua.
The statement that in a secret pro

to press cables, to the Indictment

warning. Ambassador Ton Bernstorff
and Secretary Lansing discussed the
general charge of illegal submarine
activities today. The conference
lasted ten minutes.
If the state department consents
to reopen the whole submarine sub

are numerous indications, however,
that since Lansing ceased Informal
negotiations with Bernstorff on the

It remains to be seen If today's
