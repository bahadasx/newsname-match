. LI HUE, Kauai, April 9. That the Kekaha Sugar Company would be.
willing to pay approximately $200,000 In an outright purchase of the mill
Bite at the end of'the present lease In 1920, which site includes some 25
or SO acres of land on which the mill, offices, shops and switches are now
situated,' and that the company would also he willing to pay an additional
$150,000 for .-Kekaha-Walmea government lands on a 15-year lease provld-.
Ing the ownership of thi iuillsite was a settled fact, was Mated to Govern
or Pinkham and territorial officials by Manager; II.. P. Faye last Friday.
The Waimea land lease expires next year. . "
The conference nt Kekaha was heldi
about noon, -and In the main office at
the big mill. Through the open win
(lows, as the men talked, csrme the
sweet scent of raw sugar and the hum
of heavy machinery. - V
The conversation on both sides was
free and easy, and the question of
homesteads, water and land rights
was discussed from some of its many
angles. v
Governor Asks Public Sentiment.
Governor Pinkham began the con
versation by 'stating that , he and his
men had come to look over the situa
tion first hand; to gain every bit of
Information they .could from as many
sources as' possible. , . ;
He stated furthermore that he Is
bound down by the Organic Act, which
allows that any 25,men may be heard
if they petition for homestead rights
in a certain district, regardless of
what leases the government may have
made regarding it.
11 Let us know as a people what we
are about" 'This is the plea the gov
ernor makes. He .has proposed that
a biz ncss meeting be! held in the
Honolulu armory, and that there the
land .zzl, yaterqucsUonbe threshed,
.out 'thcrrusr.ir. i ' ' .-.-

fco:r.e-f teasers taking the present land.
He declared his willingness to help
the homesteaders, however, If a. auit
oble policy could be reached by the
government; " 1...V '. ..
Rights Very Valuable.
He stated that he was., willing to
ray $iu0,000 for the mauka land and
water-rlzhta assurance of cane beine
'given if his company is allowed the
ownership of the mill by purchase
unci uc viu irooo ubd cu.
Manager Faye says he believes that
if the Kekaha cane lands are turned
over to homesteaders the result would
be a yield of 5000 tons per year "In
stead of the present yield of 15,000
tons. ' He is sure that with ownership
by. the company the yield can be lnH
creased by ; 8toring more waters" In
the mountains.
In answer to a query as to whether
he considered it feasible for the ter
ritory, to handle the distribution and
regulation of water, for homesteaders,
the ugar man replied emphatically
in the negative. . ,- . '. ' --
One homestead . would claim here
and one there,' he said, and regulation
would be mighty hard. , !
"God pity the man who la In charge
of the distribution." he said.
Kekaha mill ia making as few re
pairs or additions to maphinery and
equipment as. It can get along with
this In. view of the fact that 'Its lease
will soon expire.
vWe'did put In one $9000 piece not
fo long ago," he said, "but this was
because we found it absolutely neces
sary for the work of the mill. For
the most part we are avoiding this."
Bound By 25-Year Rule.
. Again Governor Pinkham spoke of
the fact that the' Organic Act holds
him fast by its 25ryear rule.
"We are between the devil and the
deep-sea, he laughed. .
One of the facts brought out by
the conversation was that the com
pany is making about 35,000,000 gal
lons of water a day cover some 4500
acres of cane land. ,
The' noon conference came follow
ing a busy morning, the governor
and his party going from Lihue in the
early, morning out to Waimea, Kekaha
end across government lands as far
as the famous barking sands.
At Waimea a conference held "by
Superintendent Charles FL Forbes
with W. O. Crow, owner of a small
electric light llant which supplies
light to at least50 customers, resulted
in the Waimea 'man being . added to
the list of those who must pay the
public utilities fee of 1-20 of 1 per
cent of the gross receipts of the con
cern. -
"Biir Hardy, runger on Kauai ;for
George K. Larrison, superintendent of
hydrography, was added to the list of
territorial officials, goto g along with
the party In h's Ford car through the
