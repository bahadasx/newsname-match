POSTMASTERS TO COLORS

! Even Affairs of U. S. Court in ;
Topeka Sidetracked.
(By Staff Correspondent)
Hutchinson. Kan.. April 10. Kan
sas Democratic postmasters and fed
eral appointees have declared a holi
day to manipulate the machinery for
Senator Thompson in the Democratic
state convention which meets here
Tuesday. Many postmasters, promi
nent in Kansas affairs, are here for
the convention most of them as dele
gates cr with proxies. No federal ap
pointee who owes Ivfci job to Senator
Thompson found business too impor
tant to come. In fact the federal
crowd was first on the job and has
lost no time in doing the things that
add the greatest pleasure and com
fort to the Democratic United States
senator from this stat.
No serious job of fixing for Tues
day's convention was undertaken Sun
day night or today without a confer
ence with some one of the Thompson
chieftains. Anti-Thompson Demo
crats protested. But their protest was
a faint wail in the din in the hotel
lobbies. The federal crowd was hold
ing the reins at least in the earlv
I milling and the work of slate muk
i ing was under their direction and con
trol.
It became known today that even
the affairs of the United States dis
trict court in Topeka had been slde
tracked for a day that the Thompson
supporters might give the state con
vention the attention which it seemed
to need. It was learned here that the

NEW HYDE CHARGE
Switch Poisons in Indictment
to Validate It.
Doctor Demands Case Be
Quashed on Limitations.
Kansas City, April 10. A new in
formation charging Dr. B. Clarke
Hyde of Kansas City, with poisoning
Col. Thomas H. Swope, millionaire
i philanthropist, by strychnine and cy
j anide of potassium was filed by the
prosecuting attorney today. The newln
I formation was made necessary by the
action of attorneys for the defense
i who sought to quash further prosecu
i tion under the statute limiting the
I state to four continuances. All these
continuances had been utilized by the
prosecution in an effort to gain time
in which to obtain funds for another
trlaT.
The former information against Dr.
Hyde based on an indictment by the
grand jury, charged poisoning by
strychnine and other poisons unknown
to the jury.
Nullifies Old Charges.
A motion for attorneys for the de
fense to quash this newest informa
tion is now in order and probably will
be filed within 4 8 hours. If Judge K.
E. Porterfield of the criminal court
overrules the motion to quash the
Hyde trial will begin anew. There
will be a new arraignment, another
preliminary if attorneys for Dr. Hyde
so desire, and new bond must be pro
vided. A motion to quash all further pro
cedure was pending when the new in
formation was filed today. It is the
contention of the prosecution that
this motion and all other moves by the
defense to end the prosecution of Dr.
Hyde for the murder of Colonel Swope
are nullified by the new charge.
GEORGE CAME IS FREE
Proceedings in Saline Murder Inquest
Held To Be Irregular.
Salina. Kan.. April 0. A motion to
quash the warrant on which George
Came, a farmer, was arrested in con
nection with the murder of John Bush,
a wealthy land owner, was sustained
at Came's preliminary hearing today
and Came was ordered released from
custody.
The argument of Came's attorneys
was that the proceedings of the coro
ner's jury which ordered Came held
were irregular. Cam was one of thi
original members of he jury and as
such helped to organize its proceed
ings. Later he was released from
duty and another man was selected.

Hutchinson. Ran.. April 10.
That danger of a possible defeat
in the convention might be avoid
ed, friends of Senator Thompson
today called a conference to check
lists of friendly delegates. In event
it becomes apparent that Thomp
son is in serious danger of defeat,
his name may not be presented.
Rumors in hotel lobbies today
were to the effect that James W.
Orr, Thompson's choice for na
tional committeeman, would be
ditched if it became necessary to
effect a compromise for votes. In
Uiat event, the senator's friends
would seek a compromise on a
harmony candidate, with a pro
vision that the senator was in
sured a plae.
Delegations came today from
both Rawlins and Finney counties
instructed for Orr. Kinney county
is Senator Thompson's home,
while Kaw lins county is the home
of District Attorney ltobertson.
Orr will be nominated by Thomas
Moxcey of Atchison. K. E, Mur
phy, chairman of the state com
mission, will second the nomina
tion. A. M. Jackson of Winfield
will probably nominate Hupp.
Charles L. Stephens, of Colum
bus, today announced his candi
dacy for committeeman. He lives
in Sapp's home county. Stephen
! son's fight is to divide the Third
district vote with the present
committeeman.
At a caucus held here this aft
ernoon delegates to the state con
1 vention from the Second district
elected W. E . Brook s of Fort
j Scott and J. E. Santell of Kansas
City, Kan., district delegates to
the national convention. The al
t ternates elected were L. J. Hig
gins of Fulton and W. ti. Tulles
j of Rantoul, and A. F. Hatten was
named presidential elector.
Hutchinson, Kan.. April 10. Demo
crats attending the state convention
j are today talking of dark horse pos-
sibilities for national committeeman
I to succeed Col. W. F. Sapp of Galena.
Failure of the Thompson crowd to se
i cure the election of James W. Orr of
j Atchison on an early vote, is regarded
! by many of the delegates as an almost
I certain indication that the convention
J will eliminate Orr, Sapp and John E.
Wagner of Larned, the three active
I men for the place.
Several widely known Kansas
: Democrats may be in line for Sapp's
job Tuesday in event there is a dead-
' lock in the convention concerning the
i election of a national committeeman.
Among these men is L. M. Penwell of
j Topeka. Penwell has told his friends
that he will run under certain condi
tions. Many delegates favor the election of
i E. E. Murphy of Leavenworth, chair
man of the state committee. Murphy
is not an active candidate. In fact he
is not a candidate at all. He has in
dicated, however, that he might ac
cept the election if the convention
failed to agree and a split in the party
I became imminent in the fight for com
mitteeman. Murphy has many sup-
; porters among both factions in the
; party.
Another possibility in the fight is A.
