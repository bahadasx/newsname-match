been courteously received by General
GuiteiTPZ, commanding officer at
Chihuahua, after it was demonstrat
ed that they had come on a friendly

was determined by the alarmed pub
lic, a few stones had been thrown at
them and a shot or two fired. No
one was injured.
Supplies Aiv IJmitrtl.
General Pershing said some sup
plies had been purchased in Chihua
hua mid that there appeared no din
position on the part of those with
sors -to withhold their goods, but
thfit the limited amount of supplies
(at Chihuahua at present made it al
most linnossible to get provisions,

' The present position of the advanc
ed columns was not made public, but
it was known that cavalry columns
under Colonels Urown and Dodd are
driving' south from Satcvo with all,
speed. Officers here had no infor
mation that either force had gone so
far as Parral, but they said the re
ceipt of such information would he
no surprise. General Pershing him
self is moving south along the trail

called upon him und that the two
had discussed in a friendly manner
the efforts being made by both gov
ernments to run down the common
enemy.
More nirdinen Needed.
The excellent work that had been
done by the aeroplanes lias been so
maj-ked that headquarters officials
are anxiously awaiting reinforcements
of that arm of the service.' Al
though it u now recognized that the
machines being used are not of the
type to give the best service, General
Pershing's reports Indicate that the
five yet in service are doing good
work both in scouting and carrying
dispatches. It has been due to them
that General Pershing has been able
to keep in communication at all with
the fast moving cavalry detachments.
A 1'ew Haiders Anvnted.
Heports at headquarters show that
a few arrests have been made of
those who took part in the raid nn
Columbus, N. u month ago today.
General Pershing, who reported the
arrests, did not indicate where they
were captured or whether they were
prisoners taken at Guerrero.
General Funston and bis staff were
keenly appreciative of the brilliant
extension of operations , 5n Mexico,
''ut a frank admission -wan made that
without the use of the railroads, a
material strengthening of tho forces
or the establishment of a new base
and line of communication, the move
ment into Mexico could proceed but
a short distance further unless the
advanced forces cut loos from their
base.
Hope to Vso Railroad.
Hope that permission to use the
railroad to Chihuahua yet may be
secured had not been abandoned. If
'hat permission Is denied, however,
il is not probable that General Funs
,f,n will immediately Insist on using
more troops but it is believed thnt
h' probably will suggest to the war
department the movement of the line
f communication to some point
where the base will be. much nearer
to the field of operations.

For twenty-four hours, ending at
6 p. m. yesterday.
Maximum temperature, "3 degrees:
minimum, 30 degrees; range, 43 de
grees; temperature at p. in., 3 de
grees; southwest wind; clear,
is somewhere midway between Tor
reon and Parrsil. Pedrleena Is about
thirty-five miles southwest of Tor
reon. A lnrge number of bandits are re
ported by arrivals from the north to
be operating in the Sierra Mojada.
The Sierra Mojada is 120 miles north
of Torreon and an equal distance
west of Parral. It is one of the wild
est and most desolate spots in Mexico.
There is a good deal of speculation
here as to the possibility of Villa and
Canuto Keyes planning to concentrate
their forces in this Sierra. Jf they
do any troops coming from the direc
tion of Parral would have to cross the
terrible Mapiml desert, a burning
waste Btretching a hundred miles
north and south and from fifty to
sixty miles in breadth. It is a spot
that Is dreaded by Mexicans and
shunned for foreigners.

Kl Paso, Tex.. April 9. General
Jose Ynez Salazar, one of the best

reported tonight to have crossed the'
border with the announced intention
of taking tip arms against the Unit

clnselv associated with Salazar and!
was accepted by them as true, alter

The man who gave the police their
information said that some time ago
Salazar received a letter from Gen

He was acquitted each time.
When the news of the Santa Ysabell
massacre reached Fl Paso a mob ut-

experiences caused him to openly ex

According to the released officers,
there are 15,(100, and sometimes more

committee says, "is an enormous pop

There was an Insufficient supply of;
water and soap, and Major Priestly j
says he found the men "gaunt, of a I

The supply of food also was insuf-

All supplies for the men were

Captain Lauder reports that, while
In the bungalows there was normally
one mattress for three men, in the
improvised hospital there were no
mattresses at all.
"In consequence," he says, "there
were many typhus patients scattered

Four Rrltish doctor were Infected

There were other conditions thut
are Indescribable. There was diffi

Sixty deaths occurred among the

"What the prisoners found hardest

the report, "were the Jeei'd with

After the middle of April, the con

TO BE NOMINE
OF REPUBLICANS
4.11110 spirit of harmony, not for pollll-
cat gains but for the safely and tha
'glory of the United States. We will
i support Hny one of a large number of
men who may be nominated by both
conventions. All we shall ask Is that
the republicans meet us in the spirit
In which we nre willing to meet them.
It Is a great emergency. The hour
calls for no secondratcr and for no
'also ran.' We wHnt a great leader
who will gather about him ufter hi
election the strongest men in both
parties. Give us that kind of a lead
er and we will Join in his election
with the utmost endeavor of which,
we are capable.
Puts Patriotism First.
"I fully expect the two conventions
meet at Chicago in exactly th
frame of mind to do tho best for tho
country we can. It Is a high plane,
but It is time we were on a high plane.
Root and Roosevelt were on the same
high plane when they met. Tbey did
not talk of how to make one man or
the other president, but they did talk
of the crucial period through which
the world passing and tho extreme,
the Imperative, necessity for the Unit
ed states to place on guard none but
her very best and her very strongest.
"Convince Colonel Itooscvelt thut
lie, above others, meets the require
ments of the nation and you can an
nounce him i.s a candidate for the
progressive anil republican tickets.
That, in my Judgment, would draft
him. Put until he Is so convinced ha
will not be a candidate, even though
he felt sure of both nomination and
election. That i why ho would not
permit his name to go upon any of
has been!1"' primary tickets. He wants those
1 1 wo conventions to reflect the calm
land isett led Judgment of the nation.
Ho Is Just that patriotic, regardless Of
tho opinion of men who either do not
know him or will not know him.
I'xpwts Hoot to Awilst.
'Klihu Root is one man who knows
Colonel Roosevelt and profoundly re
spects Ills hlghmlnded attitude. Hia
meeting with Roosevelt, I believe, will
have a wide effect throughout the
country, for you know there are many
men w ho would like to see Root prcs
Idi.nt and who know they never will.
These will be affected by Mr. Roofs
attitude. And Inside of two or three
weeks I expect lo see Mr. Root pub
licly advocating the things I have
been predicting, and I believe what
he says will go far towards compell
ing the nomination of Roosevelt for
president by both parties. Which is
something for which I do not conceal
my desire."
