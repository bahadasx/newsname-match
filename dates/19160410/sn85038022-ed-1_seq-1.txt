HUG CHOLERA
A lance Number of Infected Animals
In .Mason County scrum iicing
I'scd To Prcrcnt .Spread.
It Is not posslblo to tell tho exact
number of cases of hog cholora In
Mason county at the present time, but
It can bo stated with good nuthorlty
that it Is In tho hundreds. Tho rav
ages of this dread hog disease has al
ready killed qulto a number of fine an
imals nnd they nro still dying by tho
score.
A herd of over 600 hogs belonging to
Messrs. S. P. Lyons nnd Harlan Day
on tho farm of Mr. Lyons near Or
angeburg, becamo Infected and It Is
thoueht that a major portion of them
will be lost. Stnto Veterinarian It.
P Moody Injected a preventive serum
Into these hogs on Saturday, which
will save all that have not as yet con
tracted tho disease, but will do no
cood for those already sick.
Mr. Jacob Rcubcnackcr of near
Washington, purchased a herd of soV'
cnty-flvc hogs recently which were
discovered to havo cholera soon after
ho got them to his farm. Theso hogs
havo also been treated by Dr. Moody,
as also have over thirty more which
he already had and wcro apart from
tho diseased ones.
Tho situation In Mason county will
be watched with close Interest for the
next few days, as other cases of the
dlseaso may develop. It Is not thought
however, that It will bo necessary to
place a nuarantlno on tho county.
The best way to bo sure of avoiding
the disease Is to havo all hogs made
Immuno from tho dlseaso by the use
of tho serum.

SUFFItAOE VICTORY AT HAXD.
Tho Now York Trlbuno for April 7
contains the following editorial:
Advancement of tho woman suffrage
amendment to third reading In the
Senate by n voto of 29 to 13 Is almost
certain Indication of its passage when
It is taken up next week. For that all
ndvocntcs of political equality without
sex distinctions will rejolco. Tho wo
man suffrago workers havo mado a
plucky fight this year under now and
trying conditions. They deserve tho
success which apparently they havo
within tiieir grasp.
It may bo considered unfortunato
that they have strayed out of "the
sphero" which Is theirs "by naturo and
consent of mnn," as Senator Brown
felicitously puts it. But regardless of
nnturo and consctn of mnn, hundrcd3
of thousands of woman each day are
adventuring outsldo that "sphero" be-
causo thoy must, In order to live. If
tho voto, with Its privileges nnd du
ties, means any advantage to tho male
who earns his living and tho living of
others, by every stnndard of equality
nnd fair dealing his Bisters should
hnvo tho same advantage.
Woman Is not contesting tho decrco
of nature, but sho assuredly refuses
to rest content with tho "consent of
man" on a quostlon which Involves
fundamental democracy. Senator
Brown admits that ho may bo "old
fashioned." When ho opposes woman
suffrage by any such arguments it Is
proved out of his mouth. If tho man
admitted superiority of males Is tho
strength of tho opposition to tho re
form, Its prospects for next year, both
with legislators and tho voters nt
homo in tho districts, ought to pleaso
Us most ardent sympathizers.
