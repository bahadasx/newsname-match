SAFEBL0WERS GET
For the first time in three years a
job of safeblowing was pulled off
eurly yesterday morning on Main
street. A big haul was made by the
ycKK'nen who must have been experts
in their line as every Indication proves
they were masters of their art.
The chief victim was 11. liheiiianski,
whose loss runs into the thousands
as the robbers cleverly selected noth
ing but the best goods, consisting of
mounted and unmounted diumonds. It
is believed the value of the missing
property will exceed $7,000 but the
actual amount cannot he determined
until the owner completes checking
up his stock.
Before forcing the safe as Sheman
skl's the yeggs tackled the safe of
the Central Meat Market which they
treated In the same manner as the
jtfhemanski strong box. However
they found nothing of value and, after
strewing the contents of the safe on
the floor of the office moved across
the street to the jewelry store where
the big haul was made. Entrance to
the market was effected by breaking
a window In the rear.

At Shemanskl's it Is evident that
the yeggs were surprised while at
work by the appearance of Officer
Hob Ialzell. On making his custo

cipal Main street block, on St. Patrick
street, the officer, who always tries
t lie rear doors, found the entrance to
the Jewelry store open. A 60 K. V.

LONDON, Apr. 10. Income tax pay
ers, who are now sending their checks
to the treasury, the tax being payable
before April , have had to pay Just
thirty per cent more than last year,
and next year will have another forty
per cent added to the bill. This was
provided for by the finance act of
1915. Some people the tax hits pretty
hard but there is little grumbling and
the collectors report that the tax has
been paid even earlleg than It was last
year, when the large tax payers sur
prised the treasury by paying long
before It was due.
An effort has also been made to in
crease the amount received from In

earners and providing that all income
wherever derived shall be subject to
taxation. Before the war those earn

WASHINGTON, Apr. 10. The fed
eral trade commission presented to
congress a ureliminary report of us
investigations of gasoline prices. The
renort carries a mass of statistics on
production and prices, but drawn no
conclusions as to the cause of the
rise In prices.
The report says: "If prices were
raised to higher levels in some sec
tions than in others, allowances were
made for quality, freight and market
ing conditions, so it may be Inferred
that the element of artificial manipu
lating has entered Into the advance."
Price ranges show the price charg
ed by Independents averaged about
a rent higher than the Standard
prices. Exports for 1915 were 46,000,
ftoo gallons more than In 1914. The
Cimhinir field output decreased from

AND BEGIN All EHER6ETI6 CAMPAIGN
The Union Amalgamated Mining
company was formed here Saturday
for the purpose of taking over the
Amalgamated, Earl and Litigation Hill
properties in Manhattan and the
Priest mill formerly known as the Wit
tenberg mill. Hereafter these pro
perties and the mill will be operated
under one management.
The new company is in excellent
shape for a sustained production as
the winter was spent in mine develop
ment owing to the fact that it was im
possible to haul to the mill. On
March 27th the mill began running and
is now going to full capacity with
over a year's supply of ore in sight.
The group is situated west of the Man
hattan Con. and north of the Man
hattan Con. and White CapB. L. L.
Mushett is in charge of the opera
tions. Fifteen men are employed in
the mine..
At the Saturday meeting Manager
Mushett read a report to the effect
that both mine and mill are working
satisfactorily with about 20,000 tons
In sight on the Litigation Hill property
alone. Thus far no ore has been
taken from the Earl or Amalgamated
on ae.ount of the working shafts be
ing In bad condition requiring retlin-
berlng. Active work will be carried
on in the Earl In order to make avail
able large bodies of ore known to
exist there. Two shifts are employed

traction for over 180 tons.
" One of the first steps taken by the
new company will be the installation
of more settling tanks to raise the ca
pacity from 60 to 75 tons dally. The
mill ia equipped with ten stamps, a
tube mill and cyanide. ,
The development shaft in which
there is opened 20,000 tons is on the
Litigation Hill Merger where the ore
is taken out through an incline shaft
reaching a depth of 560 feet. Chutes
will be put in on the 200, 300 and 400
foot levels and it is expected that
further work will open an ore body
known to exist on the 600 foot level.
On the Amalgamated there is a 300
foot vertical shaft to a depth of 400
feet and the Earl is opened by a shaft
down 350 feet and over 700 feet ot
lateral workings. The surface equip
ment is one of the best in the state
consisting of two electric hoists, one
on the Earl and the other on the Liti
gation Hill and a gasoline hoist on the
Amalgamated.
