Commander Says Villistas
Beaten Recently at San
Francisco De Borja.
Confirmation of reports that Fran
cisco Villa was in the neighborhood
of Parral, or bad passed it, was brought
to Juarez toda by Gen. Francisco Ber

Madera.
Geo. Bertanl, who came to Juarex
for a conference with Gen. Gabriel Ga
vira, said that before he left Madera,
Saturday, authentic reports were re
ceived that Villa had been seen at
Camargo. This town Is about 60 miles
northeast of Parral. Proceeding at his
previous rate of speed, the bandit
leader would have easily made Parral.
Bertanl had no report on how closely
the American troops were following.

Both Gen. Gavlra and Gen. Bertanl
asserted today they had no knowledge
that a limit had been placed on the
operations of American troops in
Mexico.
"I - understand, however," Bertanl
added, "that the American forces will
be willing to withdraw as soon as the
Villlsta organisations are thoroughly
broken up.
Ilrlattans Friendly.
"So far the relations of the da facto
troops and the American soldiers have
been friendly and cooperative. There

Representatives of a mining firm at

say that It seems Improbable that Villa

The details of the report were not

Army officers at Gen. Funston's
headquarters were almost convinced
today that by the end of the week the
work of the punitive expedition in
Mexico w-lll have reached a critical
stage. Reports that have reached uen.
Funston indicate that Gen. Pershing
is driving his cavalry farther and
larther into Mexico without question
In spite of the increasing danger that
they soon may be beyond reach of ihe
commissary department and out of
touch with an adequate support.
Villa Makes Good Time.
Gen. Pershing appeared convinced
when he sent his last previous report
that Villa is moving forward only two
or three i:ys march ahead of the
American advanced columns and mak
ing good time, notwithstanding his re
ported wounlled leg-. The rumors that
the de facto government is becoming

clare they believe that Carranza will
give his consent for the use of the
railroads south of Juarez to Chlhua

It was authoritatively stated today
that the present method of getting

There was a "dead line" beyond which

necessary, the order to retire was given.
