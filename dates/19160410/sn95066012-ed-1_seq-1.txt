In the field with General Pershing in
Mexico, April 9, (by Aeroplane and

al Pershing pushed forward forty
eight miles by automobile on Satur
day and camped today outside of a
squalid Mexican railroad town not far
behind the advance cavalry. It is the
first time headquarters have been near
a railroad since the troops left Casas
Grandea.
Aviators who flew from Chihuahua
City on Friday are today continuing
their flights, forming the only link
between this new advance headquart
ers and the bases in rear.
Scouts say this town is full of Vil
UstaB, but the arrival of the troops has
caused no outward excitement. This
morning many Mexicans visited the
camp selling sugar, socks, gay-colored
underwear, towels and tobacco. The
troops are tired but well.
San Antonio, Texas, April 9. The
Mexican military authorities have of
fered the American punitive expedi
tion the use of Mexican telegraph and
telephone lines, according to General
Pershing's report to General Funston
today. The offer was made to the
aviators who landed in Chihuahua City
last week.
Collins M. Graves
For Delegate.
The Free Press has taken the posi
tion all along that no man should be
elected a delegate to the republican
national convention who is not willing
to take the republicans of Vermont in
to his confidence and tell them where
he stands as to choice of a candidate
for the presidency of the United
States. That is the type of man the
people of Vermont as a whole believe
In. That is the kind of man the repub
licans of Vermont need to represent
them in the national councils of the
party at this particular time, whether
the delegation is to support Hughes or
not.
Collins M. Graves is that kind of a
man, and we are pleased to be able to
aa l,a nUf f .v,
nu u ilia uaiiic iu iiiv ui iiiunc v
believe Hughes would be able to bring
the two wings of the party together,
and make an aggressive and success
ful contest for the triumph of republi
can principles in our land. If we re
member correctly, Mr. Graves was in
favor of the nomination of Roosevelt
as opposed to Taft in the preliminary
campaign leading up to tho Chicago
convention in 1912, but he supported
the republican ticket In the election.
Tho republicanism of Mr. Graves is
or the Hughes typo and he Is there
fore in thorough sympathy with his
party throughout Vermont at the pres
ent time. He would make an excel
lent representative of tho first con
gressional district and is just the kind
of young republican that the party
should push to the front In order to
keep in touch with the times and help
it retain its youthful energy along
with tho ripe experience of years.
Bepnlngton county Is one of those
which had no representative on the
delegation to the republican national
convention In 1912. Indeed, that
county has not had a delegato in
twelve years, and tho rest of the dis
trict will undoubtedly concede recog
nition to it in this connection in 1916.

Paris, April 10 The Germans have

Dead Man hill and at all other points
the attacks were repulsed, according

714 prisoners and 13 pieces
of artillery in the retreat from Beth

dy. London, April 10. The French have
evacuated the town of Bethincourt,
west of tho Meuso river and north
west of Verdun, where the line made
a sharp salient to the north.
Following the withdrawal, which
was accomplished Saturday night
without difficulty, according to the
French official report, the Germans
made a turions attack on tho new
French line, extending from Avocourt
wood to Cummieres and across the
Meuse river, without success and with
heavy lotscs. East of the Meuse,
meanwhile, the French captured Ger
man trenches near Douaumont.
No German report of the evacuation
of Bethincourt had been received last
night, but the official announcement
of the retirement anil the subsequent
battle was made at Paris last evening.
A summary of the official report
sent from Paris follows: "The French
evacuated the Bethincourt salient Sat
urday night and the Germans today
attacked with great violence their
new line from Avocourt to Cumieres.
but were repulsed with sanguinary
losses. Only at one point, northeast of
Avocourt, did the Germans succeed in
entering the French trenches, and
from this position they were immedi
ately ejected through a counter-attack."
Karller in the day the following
dispatch came from Paris: "The cap
ture by French troops of about 150
meters of a German trench southwest
of Douaumont village, northeast of
Verdun was announced by the war
olllce this afternoon. Progress in
communicating trenches south of the
village also was reported. The Ger
mans made two hand grenade attacks
on French positions in the ( nillette
wood in the Dauaumont region, but
both were repulsed. West of the
Meuse there was only feeble artillery
activity."
MAKING BIRD HOUSES
New and Bright Material is Not
Desirable.
:n the making and placing of Bird
Houses, certain rules must be ob
served or the birds will not use them
Houses made of old weather-stained
boards or boards with tho bark on are
more attractive to tho birds than those
made of now lumber. If the house Is
painted, use neutral colors as the birds
seem suspicious of bright colors and
are not inclined to use the houses so
painted.
Make the roof raintight and let it
overhang tho entrance. Do not make
tho bottom too tight for if any rain
drives in it should have a chance to
drain oik
Li t the house tip forward a little on
the side of the entrance hole. It should
never lean back ward.
Have the roof hinged so that the
nests of any undesirable bird like tin
English Sparrow or Starling can be
easily removed.
The size of the house must cones
pond to a certain extent lo the size of
the bird sought for. This is especially
true regarding the entrance hole. For
a house wren the entrance hole should
be the size of a silver quarter: for n
chickadee, the size of a silver half
I dollar; for mithatches, blue birds and
tree swallows tho size of a silver dot
. lar. Robins, phebes, barn swallow
and eave swallows will place their
nests on almost any firm platform if
it is protected from the rain by an
overhanging roof.
une oi me most important precau
Hons to observe is to make the neslinu
boxes inaccessible to cuts, rats and
mice. Cats are great bird destroyers
Each domestic i at kills on an average
over r0 wild birds In n year.

DR. THOMAS RESENTS ATTACK
President of Middlebury Replies
to
Anonymous Criticism.
Referring to an anonymous com
munication appearing in a Burlington
newspaper and purporting to have
been written by a Middlebury resident
in which the statement was made that
President Thomas of Middlebury col
lege would have accepted the coinmis
sionershlp of education, if he could
have gotten $0000 a year, Dr. Thomas
makes a statement In part as follows:
"I did not suggest $t!0ou or any oth
er amount as salary as commission
er of education. In my negotiations
with the board of education no fig
ures were mentioned on either side.
"I regret that my name was made
public in this connection, but since I
have been publicly accused of mer
cenary motives, it is only fair to me
that the public be given an opportuni
ty to read in full the letter in which 1
declined the commisaionershlp."
The letter follows:
November C, 1915.
Hon. Frank II. Brooks,
St. Johnsbury, Vermont.
My Dear Mr. Brooks:
The proposition made to me in be
half of the State board of education in
our interview some weeks ago has
been much on my mind and I have
tried to give to it the careful and con
scientious consideration which it de
serves. I think can now foresee
,..i,. ;.... i .1... .(..is... ,..;n 1.,. ....
H llill ill limit wi; mil ui ui-, iiw inai- ,
ter how long 1 think of it nor what '
further considerations may be ad
vanced, and 1 owe it to your board not
to delay my reply longer.
My judgment is that I can not ac
cept the position and that in the end
I can best serve the State of Vermont
by remaining in Middlebury College.
trust I appreciate the opportunities
'iffordod by the commissiotiershlp and
the far-reaching possibilities of t Im
position. The needs of the 00.000
lilldren of Vermont, the evils from
which they are suffering from lack of
efficient administration of their school
system, and the benefits which might
come to them through high-minded
purpose and enkindling inspiration in
State leadership in education, impress
me most deeply. I know perfectly well
that a new enthusiasm could go forth
from the position you hold before me
that would reach every last hamlet in
ermoni with stimulus for worthier
and nobler life, and that in a few
years through It schools the State it
self could be brought to a higher level
both In economic efficiency nnd in
moral welfare. I am convinced that
adical change is necessary to bring
about harmony and unity of effort, as
well as to usher In large-minded en
deavor for improvement, free from
petty Jealousies and personal politics.
With such feelings as to the needs
and possibilities, how can 1 put the re-
ponsibllity aside? A little over seven
ears ago I began my work for Mid
dlebury College. 1 found it after 1"S
ears still feeble, weak In resources,
meagre In curriculum, its alumni pro
nouncing its very name with apology, j
brought to it no experience and little
wisdom, but a great pride in the tradi
tion of the college as I had learned It
when a child, and an unshakable con
viction that the true and rightful po- I
sition of Middlebury College is alomi- I
side Dartmouth and Williams, Am
herst and Rowdoln, as a strong New I
England college, one of those honor-'
able institutions destined to maintain
the tradition of Puritan worth for the
saving of the American nation.
That I felt my weakness before the
great work of bringlm: the college to
her own, and still feel it, you can well
imagine. But ! can not deny the fact
that a substantial beginning lias been
made. In these seven years the re
sources of the college have been
doubled. The campus of 'M acres with
five buildings has grown to 144. with
IS. The faculty has trebled and the
student body increased f.f tier cent.
Better than all. there is new spirit
of faith and courage and the old name
which used to be spoken hesitatingly
now rings out with a challenge. The
college is on its way to its historic
level, to take it 3 place once more
among the leaders in the higher edu
cational life of America.
I can not deny that those who must
continue this work, if it is to be con
tinued, look to me to proceed with the
task. My own heart and conscience
have been no thoroughly imbued with
the spirit nnd enthusiasm of this work
that I can not bring myself lo a trans
fer of sphere. I know It would still lie
for Vermont, my ultimate aim here,
but providence hiis laid upon me this
work for Vermont, and It seems to me
that 1 can not do better than lay my
bones beneath a larger nnd better
Middlebury College, the door of hope
and opportunity for Vermont's boys
nnd girls, and that in bringing it to the
best estate I can is the highest service
I can render to the State. This work
can be done only by one to the manor
born, while the other can be accom
plished without the peculiar attach
ments of association which have stood
me in such good stead here.
Faithfully yours,
John M. Thomas. 1

ADMINISTRATION IS HOPEFUL
Expects to Be Able to Soon Determine
Upon Next Step in Sussex
Controversy.
Washington, April lo. While defi
nite action by the government on the
matter of the sinking of the channel
liner Sussex has been delayed await-
ing the arrival of the St. Paul with af-
lidavlts, two important incidents bear- !
ing upon the controversy occurred to- ,
day. The first was a request by Am
bassador von liornstortf for a confer
ence with Secretary Lansing and the
second was a cablegram from Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin stating that
. . . , . . . ,
,lfi ll0fllt(l ,l " ?
man foreign olllce to the latest Ameri
can note today.
Secretary Lansing stated that the
conference with Ambassador liern
stortf was at the request of the latter
but that the ambassador did not say
why be desired the meeting.
Washington, April 10. The adminis
tration expects to be in a position with
In the next 48 hours to determine what
shall be the next step of the United
Slates in the situation resulting from
the numerous disasters which recently
have overtaken merchant ships
cairying American citizens. Secre
tary Lansing said he had not received
official confirmation of press dispatch
es announcing Germany's disclaimer
of responsibility for the explosion
which damaged the Sussex. He ex
pects definite word today.
At the same time he expects to re
ceive a number of affidavits obtained
from sunivors of the Sussex of the
American embassies in lxmdon aud
Paris. With these affidavits aud of
flicial word that Germany denies re
sponsibility in the Sussex case be
fore It the administration will be able
quickly to determine the course the
United States will pursue. All the
available evidence will be considered
by the president and his cabinet to
il, i ncv".
While official expression of opinion
was withheld, it was strongly intimat
ed at Washington last night that high
officials regarded it as doubttul
whether the United States could take
action on the case of the Sussex, in
view of the German denial. Esptuial
attention now is being directed at the
accumulation of evidence regarding
i other cases which the United States
has been Investigating. Of these the
ase of t ho Manchester Engineer ap
peared to be the most aggravating.
The evidence fIiows that at least one
of the survivors from that ship swears
he saw the periscope of a submarine.
Whether this declaration has been
corroborated is unknown, the admin
istration not being disposed to divulge
the evidence collected.

Shaftsbury Woman Visits Fenning-

MRS. VAUGHN'S ODD JCURNFY
Settlement of Brother's Estate Takes
Her Out of a Seclusion of Four
Decadet.
Henrietta Vaughn, aged (7, who has
passed her entire life in the adjoining
town of Shaftsbury and who is as vig
orous in body and keen of mind as
many women on the sunny side of 50,
fievcr saw a trolley car until last
Thursday when she came to Benning
ton on business connected with tho
settlement of the estate of her recently
deceased brother, Jesse Vaughn. Sho
made the journey from North Ben
nington to this village by the vehiclo
which the Chinaman said wciu without
pushee or pullee" and didn't enjoy
the experience one little bit. It was
all too much of an abrupt change from
the quiet of the hillside farm in Shafts
bury.
It was not only her first trolley ride
but It was her first visit to Bennington
in 40 yeats. notwithstanding the fact
that she has passed her entire life with
in five miles of North Bennington vil
lage. She also said that during tho
ast four decades, until she left homo
hist Thursday, she had not been out-
ide the limits of the town of Shafts
bury. Miss Vaughn and her brother
lived together on a larm of over 2M
acres which had descended to them
from their father. Heman Vaughn.

days ago, one of the neighbors, who
ad gathered at the house, as neigh
bors in the rural districts of Vermont
have been wont to gather in times of
trouble ever since the days of the ear
ly settlers, found among some Jitter an
eld porketbook containing a $20 gold
piece. . - --- --- -
News of the finding of the gold piece
thread through the neighborhood and
like many rumors it increased in size
the further it traveled. In a short
time there was a well established sus
picion that there must be more gold
hidden about the place and with tho
suspicion came the desire to assist in
the search for the concealed wealth.
George Robinson of Shaftsbury, who
has had a large amount of experience
In the settlement of estates involving
farm property, has been appointed ad
ministrator of the estate and as a pre
cautionarv measure a custodian has
been temporarily placed in charge.
With the interest that has been awak
ened in the neighborhood in the mat
ter seme one with no intention of do
lug anything out ofthe way could
easily complicate the settlement of the
estate and make no little trouble for
the rightful heirs. Because of this
possibility the probate court deemed
it wise to take all necessary steps to
guard tho interests of the estate.
