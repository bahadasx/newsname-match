ACCUSED OF MURDER
What Hefell an Unoffending
Youth at 2 A. M., as Told
by Himself.
Bj II. I'. MALKUS.
1 am mild looking and if an inoffen
sive disposition 1 am guiltless of
what is cominonlj called "ttmpcr,"
and I do not recall having Ioiik held
iiatnd against oven my enemies.
It is in the light of this modest
confession that the incident I am about
to relate is strange and inconceivable.
At 2 a m Fridaj I alighted from
a car at Grand avenue and Olive
stmt in St. Louis Tor reasons best
Known to mjself, I choose to begin
here, passing over tiie events of the ev
ening. I paused brieilj at the corner and
thin started to walk up Grand ave
nue to a point where I could get a car
that would take me to the house of a
friend I later discovered that I could
have taken a cross-town car, but at
the time I was unfamiliar with the
transfer svstem that is in operation on
the St I.ouis street railway svstem
After walking half a block I lecon
sidered and determined to spond the
night in a near-by hotel Retracing
my steps to the corner, I again paused
and looked about for a hotel I dis
covered one on the opposite side of
the street. Rut a more or less familiar
sight attracted my attention, and
seized by a happj inspiration, I has
tened thither. I should have known
that the hour was past 1 The place
was closed
Hun- 'lli.ni 'Ihree Poliicimn 'I here.
I noticed a policeman on the oppo
site corner, but I had seen many ear
lier in the day and thev had ceasrd
to ho a noveltv. I heeded him not and
rosscd the street and entered the lob
bv of the hotel. Imagine mv surprise
and alarm when five officers gathered
around and looked over my shoulder
as I began to register.
I confess that I was unnerved With
trembling hand I wrote "II. L. Smith,
Sedalia. Mo " The significance of this
lies in the fact that my name is not
Smith and I have never seen Sedalia
I once roomed with a oung man
whose home was in Sedalia and that is
how- I knew there was such a place.
One of the officers pushed me rude
ly from the register and examined the
entrj I had just made.
Here my memory is not clear I was
variously questioned as to my identitv
mv business, my purpose in life, mj
hopes, ambitions, fears and aspira
tions I persisted (I blush to admit it)
in the deception. Of course I could
not prove that I was Smith of Sedalia,
hut the officrs could not shake me in
in) contentions I almost believed my
self that my name was Smith and that
I had been going under an assumed
name since my birth.
Word Pit lure of Sedalia.
I'pon the request of the officers, I de
ccribd the neighborhood of my home
in Sedalia I described the topogra
phy of the surrounding country. Thev
seemed satisfied with my descriptions
and their glances at each other seemed
to sav, "He lives in Sedalia, all right."
Rut somewhere I must have made
statements that were incompatible
with one another contradictory, as it
were I was taken to a police station
At the station I was accused of mur
(Wing Officers McKcnna and Dillon,
who had been killed a short time
before bv automobile thieves Ac
cusing fingers pointed at me and rough
hands were laid upon me I saw the
gallons in my mind's eve.
Horrors' I jerked a handkerchief
from my pocket and drew it across my
fevered brow. As I did so a traveling
case of an organization I belong to fell
upon the door It was seized upon.
Then the sun shone again. I was
identified and vindicated. The desk
sergeant gave me some fatherly ad
vice to govern my future conduct whan
in the clutches of the law. Never
aKain will i speak an untruth.

.Samuel Barnes Paid $S for Capturing
Cons From Pound-Keeper.
It doesn't happen every da that
is, being arrested and fined for tak
ing what rightfully belongs to jou.
But that is what happened to Samuel
Barnes when he took four cows away
from the city pound-keeper jesterday.
He was tried in the police court this
morning and fined.
Here is the story. Barnes, it is al
leged, has been careless lately about
letting his four cows run loose in
Westwood. Yesterday morning Mrs.
Turner McBainc had them put in a
barn. Then she telephoned the pound
keeper, Frank Coleman, who went to
get the cattle.
On the way back, near Stewart
Bridge, he met Barnes, who protested
against the capture. The men argued
the matter, and the argument ended
'r Barnes taking the cattle. Coleman
went to the police station and had a
wirrant sworn out for Barnes.
Judge Edwards put the finishing
touches on tho case this morning by
fining Barnes $4 and costs in addition
to St for each cow, the pound-keeper's
fee for taking charge of stray cat
tle.
