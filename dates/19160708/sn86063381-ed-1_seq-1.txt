PIONEER TO START
FUND TO BUILD NEW
BATH HOUSES HERE
Present Houses- on Diamond Point
are a Disgrace to the City of
Bemidji.
CONTRIBUTIONS OF ANY
SIZE WILL BE RECEIVED
Barker Gives Ten Dollars Palmer
Will Furnish Nails and
Hardware.
The bath houses at Diamond Point
are a disgrace to the city of Bemidji.
They have no roofs, parts of them
are torn down and they are filthy
with dirt. There is not a day that
passes that many bathers are put to
much inconvenience on account of
the houses.
Hundreds of bathers are bathing
at Diamond Point every day.
There is no other progressive city
in the northwest that would tolerate
such a condition of bath houses as
the Bemidji houses.
To Give Contributions.
The Pioneer is ready to do what
It can to secure new bath houses and
will open a popular subscription and
will see that new houses are con
structed. It will open the contri
bution with ten dollars. Contribu
tions of any size will be received and
should be sent at once to the Pioneer
office so that work on the new bath
houses can begin immediately.
Merchants Give Share.
Business men who were approached
in regard to the matter today were
enthusiastic^ about it and agreed to
contribute their share to the con
struction of new bath houses. E. A.
Barker, of Barker's Drug store, agreed
to contribute ten dollars to* the fund.
A. B. Palmer of the Palmer Hard
ware store agreed to furnish all the
hardware and nails for the construc
tion, of the bath, houses,
son, city engineer, has agreed to con
tribute his services to see that the
houses are properly constructed.
It is planned to build a house for
women and a house for men. It is
believed that the two buildings can
be constructed for less than several
hundred dollars.
To Name Committee.
The money collected by the Pio
neer will be turned over to a commit
tee which will be named Monday.
The committee will meet, probably
Monday night, and if sufficient funds
are donated work on the new houses
will begin next week.
A list of the contributors will be
published in the Pioneer Monday.
Mayor Charles Vandersluis has ap
proved the plan of the Pioneer for se
curing of new bath houses.

BRITISH GUNS AND LEADERS THAT FIGURE IN HUGE OFFENSIVE
i
Fast Game to Be Played This Evening Little Falls Considered One of
of Fastest Teams in State Gourd and Twiner Will Form Battery
for Visitors Benton. Whaling, and Berrigan Lead in Batting...*-
"Jimmy" Withers, one of the stars of the famous Hibbing team,
will pitch for the Bemidji nine tthis evening when the locals clash
with the fast Little Falls team. Withers .was formerly a member
of the Kansas City American Association team and was a member
of the Duluth pennant winning team of the Northern league in
1914. He was been with the Hibbing club for the pas two years.
The Little Falls baseball team will arrive in the city tonight and
will clash with Bemidji this evening at the new athletic park at
6:45 o'clock. Both teams have been strengthened during the past week
and it is believed that the game will be one of the fastest this season.
Game Tomorrow Also.
As this is the first game of the season to be played in the evening,
every fan is urged to attend. If evening games prove successful more
games will probably be held.
The Little Falls and Bemidji teams will clash again tomorrow af-
ternoon at three o'clock.
Manager Berkin of Little Falls is
coming to Bemidji with a strong
lineup and he hopes to cop both
games. Gourd and Tanner will form
the battery for the Little Falls team.
Allison will be on first base, Meyers
at short, Briere at third base, Dun
phy left field, Longley center and
Liljedahl right field. Williams, for
merly of the Minneapolis association
team, will probably play second base
for Little Falls.
Frank in Field.
The Bemidji team will probably
be strengthened by several new play
ers. LaForce of Fort Ripley will
pitch one of the games for the locals.
Frank, star catcher for the Bemidji
nine, will probably play in the out
field, because of his hitting, as his
finger which he injured in the game
last Sunday, has not healed. Erick
son will be behind the bat.

Troops Not Moved.
Camp Bobleter, Fort Snelling,
Minn., July 8.~At revelee today there
seemed little chance for substantia
tion of the rumor that part of Min

train for the border today. In fact,
officers, basing their presumption
upon the fact that 24 hours' notice
is needed for railroads to get neces
sary equipment, pointed out that
since such orders had not been issued,
it seemed unlikely that any troops
would entrain for the border before
possibly Monday, if then.

4 DROWNED 50 HOMELESS
IN RED RIVER FLOOD
Fargo, N. D.f July 8.Four deaths,
the dispossesion of their homes of
about fifty families in Fargo and
Moorhead, and the drowning out of
several thousand acrs of farm lands,
along the Red River and tributaries,
constitute the toll of lives and pro
perty damage done so far by reason
of torrential rains in this section dur
ing the past week. With a record of
over four inches of rain in less than
a week, the Red River at this point
was last night within eight feet of
the highest level it attained during
the spring flood, and it is still rising
very rapidly.
The Red River in Fargo is again
lapping at the foundation walls of the
city auditorium. Island park is com
pletely cut off, and a great lagoon at
the foot of Broadway, as well as the
paved street beside the dam, have,
become great swimming pools in
which hundreds of Fargo people,
young and old, disported themselves
yesterday. Fargo assumed the ap
pearance of a beach city as a result.
The greatest floods are reported
around Ortonville, Minn., where the
land is low and several hundreds of
acres of farm lands are under water,,
there. /i
