VOLUME XXV ST. FRAMCISVILL WEST PLICIAA PARISM, LO.UIHANA.. SATURDAY. JULY 10t.O. 1 1.
RP FOR FAR
The interest displayed by the ladies
of the Pair Association at their meet.
lnl Wednesday is highly gratifying.
The number of ladles who attend this
monthly meeting is constantly increas
in0. They are taking hold with a vim
that augurs well for a saccessful fair.
It is the consensus of opinkion that no
succesaful fair has ever been held
without the cooperation of the ladies.
We have their co6peration - hence a
sucoessful fair ls assured.
The men folks were not so much in
evidence Wednesday. Hut their ab
sence was not due to lark of interest
in the fair. They were busy at home
getting things ready to show at the
fair. We haive reports that indicate
that we are to have one' of the best
live stock shows ever pulled of in any
parish. We have the goods and the
farmers are making preparations to
bring them in.
The secretary reported that the fair
catalogp had been printed and had a
fe-w sample copies to show. The re
maining coples are now ready for dis
tribution. The cooperation of post
masters, bankers, storekeepers and
others is desired to help place these
catalogs whe.re they will do the most
good. If you are impatient to receive
your copy, Just drop a postal card to
the secretary and your copy will be
mailed to you at once.
The secretary was authorized to
secure' a small book for keeping the
minutes of the Association meetings.
and secure envelopes for fair catalogs.
A sgÂºd' suggestion wa L ide by
Mr Wood Ilis idea is to have the
merchants and others who do coIsid
erable writing to have the announee
maet of the Parish Pair prnlted on
their e'nvelopes. Mr Robinson prom
lies to print these envelopes at such a
reasonable rate that every one can
afford to have the printing done. Step
forward. Mr. Merchat,. Mr. Ranker,
Mr. Insurance Agent. Mr Doctor, Mr.
lawyer. Mr. Candldate, and show your
Interest by having this printing done
and help advertise the fact that we
are going to have a full -edged Parish
FPair this fall. This is about what you
want on your envelope: "West Peli
iana Parish Pair,October 12-13-14. 1916.
tI. Frannciaille, La."
It was moved, seconded and carried
that the secretary order one hundred
pl,lnterd banners to go on the rear of
automobiles. carriages, etc.. advertis
ing the Pair. These banners have been
ordered and will bear the following in
scription: "West P'elidlana Parish Pair,
(Oct. it, 13, 14. 1916." They are of good
quality cloth, printed in waterproof ink.
and have 13 feet of strong tape on each
banner for attaching to ear, All auto
owners and others who wish one of
aeme banners should speak quickly as
the supply Ia limited. They will be in
the hands of the asecretary In ahbut
two weeks. See the ecretary and ask
him to save one for you,
Moved, saonded and arried that
the secretary employ Mr. lDaer to
make plans and speaeideations for the
eoanstruction work necessary for the
fair grounds and that this work be
done at once.
All superitaendent ad lassistant
superintendeata are reanested to pre
pare reports of progress for the next
meeting of the Fair Assoeiation. it is
desired, if possible, to gel a more
definite idea of the anumber of exhlb
Itors who expect to partlcipate in the
Pair. and also the number of exhibitsta
that will be shown. Thl is Is eeesary
ia order that the Fair tsmaaaement
may be able to provide adequate stalla

WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
(New Oilt~ans Times-Picayune )
4il three of the national convention
platformns declare for woman suffrage.
anal there i, an a matter of fact. very
litlle difference between their expres
acitn on this sabject.
t'rhe IRepublican platform says. "The
ht,,Itubliean party " ' ' favors the
etvensieon of suffrage to women, but
recognises the right of each state to
settle this question for itself."
The I)emocratic platform says: "We
recormm,nt.nd the extension of the fran
chine to the women of the country by
ithe states upon the same terms as
to men.'
This Is not satisfactory to many of
the suffragists, who would like to get
what the) antlt, not by the slow prn+ess
of state adoption, but by a national
amendment which would extend the
ballot to all the women of the countr)
at one' stroke Their attention has been
called to the fact that this has been
doAne in only one case, in favor of the
negro; and all parties have had occa
smon to regret this action. As a matter
of fact, iin spite of this franchise amend
nlent. a majority of the negroes do not
vote today. On the other hand, by
puersuing the slower policy of winning
suffrage from the stateos, the women
enjoy the rigllht in eleven states and
far more of them vote today than
nregres, barked as the latter are by a
federal eonstitutional amendment.
The women have failed In several
states by very slim adverse majorities,
which they feel conAfdent of overcom
ing in time. as they did in Oregon.
where. after tweo defeats tey "won
mul." In Mlrchigan they lost one elc
tion by less than a thousand votes, and
in Iowa they were defeated by sn slim
a majority that for severl days It was
bmelieved that the sufrage almendment
had carried. Its chances may be con
eidered as reasonably fair In elghl or
te;n states It will take time to make
ma.ch progresa in some of the others.
Perhaps the vote in the emocratic
national convention will give some
inkling of how the atatee atand on this
questIlon. If a" the outlook for aulfrsae
In most tnoeontaging. In twentytellght
states the vote of the delegations was
unanlmounly in favor of woman Ued
frege, and in live others there wu only
one adverse vote. The strongest oppo
sition huas been thought to he in the
Routh. yet Misaistppl. Artanas., Ten.
nessee. VirgiIa and Uouth Carolina
voted unanimously to give women the
ballot. Texas was one of the leaders
of the opposition, with I2 to 4 votes,
and will probably be the last state to
surrender to the women. Oeorgla stood
23 to 4 agallanst the great, MarIyland
was ananitmosly oppoed to It. North
Carolina and Imltasaa were somewhat
equally aplit, each state votilg I to 12
agaLinat suffrage. (Ohio bas,. by popular
vote, twice in the last few years re
jected suffrae by larle majorlIts, and
has etvidently not ehangad its views on
this point, for it split even on the
quaetio tIn the convention. The only
other srtote oppoittion came from
Indiana. I*ew Jersey and Went Vir
gtini. Oa the other hand, the great
states of New York. Penaeylvalat and
Massacuett, all of whech voted satf
frage down ia their last state else
lonsa. were alloieally ti lts favorG
in the DImeerptlc conventona.

Federal Inquiry or
Railroad Strike?
Paced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
that would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs of
$100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
With these employee whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by such
a public body.
Railroads Urpge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement of
the controversy s as follows:

L eArs Refuse Offw and Take Strike Vote
Leaders of the train service brotherhoods, at the joint conference held in New
York, June 1.15, refused the offer of the railroads to submit the issue to arbitration
or Federal review, and the employee are now voting on the question whether
authority shall be given these leaders to declare a nation-wide strike.
The Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads as the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred for these reasons:

A Quesmtto For the Public to Decide
The railroads feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100 000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one.afth of all the employee, without a clear mandate from a public tribunal that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
