How a mother Spaniel deserted her
own litter to suckle two coyote pups,
and how the two pup's grown to dog
hooil. created a sensation in St. Louis
and nearly caused their owner to o
arrested for blocking the trafile was
told the Newsman recently by Fred
J. Holderle, of tho Tramparos, who drop
ped into the News olllce While tha
Newsman was trying to decide whether
to run a Itilcy poem or write one him
self after a search thru tho Rhymer's
Lexicon for other words that rhymed
witli hot besides 'weir and dell" and
spell- and 'bell' "
It was some years ago. Just how
many the prosperous Tramparos farm
1 r did not state, but when he first came
10 nils' country he captured two coyoto
pups.
Taking them to the hotel where he
stayed he tried to feed them milk from
.1 saucer, which was only partly suo
eessful. The Spaniel owned by the
station ngitit had Just given birth to
a litter of pups nnd the agent sug
ue ted that tiie coyotes lie fed natur
ally by an unnatural mother. Holderle
accepted the proposition and that day
when Hie Spaniel came to the hotel for
In r midday meal she was placed In the
hot with the coyotes. The two little
woImm icuk their new diet readily
and to the surprise of all who witness
ed the experiment, the Spaniel raised
110 objection to her foster-children. She
c une to the hotel the net day, as usual
m l wan li.iln placed with tho coyotes,
t'lii ic.si, It of the former expericnt
A..S rii.iaii'il. Hut the experiment, re
sulting i-j veil for the coyotes, re
I'l'lt. d dis.i.'.terously for the little span
iel pups. The third, day tho mother tle
si rtnl .her ran pups, tearing them In
tii" tt-iiejit .ni,: to stan.o and took
up In- alioili. . 1 tao bo:, ihul had been
u m d for the coyotes.

I collars ami chains, and placed them In
ti.. I.ae ..,, 11, .fore he had been

It..' tram and the coufusion Incident to
the loading and unloading of baggage.
Nothing the baggage man said, would
qua t llillii except for Holderle to rldu

A layover of a day was necessary In
st. I.ouis and fea ling to leave the coy
otes with strangers Holderle decided to
take Hum Willi him to see the sights
of tin- city. They were well chain
broken and followed to heel us well as
any dog with generations of training to
follow man, but everywhere he went
a crowd collected to admire and ask
iiucstions. When Holderle moved on t
ouesUons. When Holderle moved on
the crowd or that part of It which
possibly coulil, moved with him until
traille on the street was nearly block
ed. The trallic cop Investigated and Hold
erle was nearly to be arrested when tho
convinced the police oftlccr that he was
Just leading the coyotes about until
Hun time and could not keep tha
crowds from gathering 1 to see the
strange animals.
"Why don't you take 11 street ear?'"
asked tho cop.
' The conductor won't let me on with
tho coyotes." explained Holderle.
'Hogs are forbidden on the carB,"
stated the cop, "but there Is no rulo
anywhere that prevents coyotes from
enjoying a car ride. You tell the next
conductor that."
The Union county man did and roda
the cars to his heart's content there
after and ttiD coyotes ceased to bo
worried by crowds of curious St. Louis
at.B. Tim trip to Ohio wus a success. Hold
erle visited relatives and friends for
several weeks und sold the coyotes to
some people who desired them biforo
he returned to New Mexico.
The two have dlel long since but the
memory of their capture and the trip
to Ohio will remain with Holderlo as
one of the most Interesting of his ex
