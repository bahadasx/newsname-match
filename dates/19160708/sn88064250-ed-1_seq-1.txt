LAWLER CANDIDATE FOR
STATE AFFAIRS BOARD
Opelqusean Throws Hat into Uing
for Important Position and Has
Consideralle Backing
J. G. Lawler, prominent and well
known local ;real estate dealer, will
be an applicant for a position on
the state board of acairs, if the
Powell bill is approved by the
voters of Louisiana.
Mr. Lawler was encouraged to go
into the fight by friends throughout
Louisiana. but especially those re
siding in Southwestern Louisiana
parishes . He is backed by some of
the most influential men of the
state, and his friends predict that
he is bound to be. successful, pro
vided that the people of St. Landr:y
show their willingness'&to back Mr..
Lawler's candidacy, as it is believed
they, will.
St. Landry 'is one of the largest
parishes of the state, and it is
figured that something should be
awarded to this parish; as Mr.
Lawler is an expert real estate
dealer, knows the condition-of af
fairs in this state, his friends feel
that he is thoroughly able and
competent to render the state valu
able assistance as a member of the
proposed state board of affairs,
which will take the place of the
state board of appraisers and the
state board of equalizers.
BABIN IS GIVEN RAISE BY
ST. LANDRY POLICE JURY
Popular Young Farm Demonstrator
Shows that He's A Hustler and
Gets More Pay from Parish
W. M. Babin, popular young
farm demonstrator, who has show
ed all these fellows from Missouri
that he is able to teach them some
thing new every day in, the week
about the art of tilling the soil,
has made good in the eyes of t"we
police jury.
Mr. Babin was given a material
increase of salary, since lis ex
p~nses were running so high, as be
is accommodating every farmer in
the parish, who needs assistance.:
The many compliments paid Mr
Babin must be a source "f great
gratification t him, as practtiraly
every member of the p.,ii"e j.iry
expressed his satisfaction an;d ap
proval of the work acc ,mplishf.o
by the little "Cajan book farmer"
from Ascension parish.
The St. Landry fa1'r demonstra
tor has been h-e_ only a short
while, less than six montns, and in
that short time he has accompli., ed
many things, which has repaid the
parish manifold for the salary
given him. There wa,; sorme oppo
sition at. first to the arpioin.nlent .f
a farm demonstrator, but now that
Mr. Babin has taken all those local
Missourians and showed faeer that
a "book farmer" could teach the
man who has farmed all his life
something about the farm which he
had never thought of before, it is
likely that the young Louisiana
State graduate will remain here as
long as he wants.

TWO DAILY TRAINS ON
SOlUTHERN PACIFIC SOON
Supreme Court Upholds Railroad
Commission and Railroad Will
Furnish Another Train
The Supreme Court recently up
held the decision of th eLouisiana
Railroad Commission in the matter
of thepatrons versus the Southern
Pacific.
For the past several years a de
sire has been expressed by the pub
lic, along the Alexandria branch,
for an additional train between
Lafayette and Alexandria, but the
railroad never would comply with
the wishes of the people on this
matter, claiming that business did
not justify the operatipn of twr
daily passenger trains netween -
these two points.
Through the Alexandria Cham
ber of Commerce and other public
bodies the matter was brought be
fore the railroad commission and
the Southern Paciflec was ordered
to do so and the matterwas brought
into court with theresuWt that the
decision of the commission was up
held.
The additional passenger train,
from a public viewpoint, wilt be
Rreatly accommodating, thus af
fording better traveling facilities
for the thousands of peoplei living
along the Alexandria branch. It is
hoped that the railroad will soon
comply with the orders of the
commission.
"I am the candrate' of no set of
politicians, or factlon. I am
going direct to t~Vb people for
my commission as istict At
torney.. I have ~rver held office
atd alI ask i .iance. If' I
don't mak good you uned not
wait 20 yeors to turn me out,
I'll quit in four years."

his record. Alright, I shall ac
cept the challange and at the
proper time, discuss that record
in detail."

The police jury, without a dis
senting vote proceeded to elect the

was being elected parish printer,

TRUCK IPBOPOSITION
LITERALLY MIUBDERE
City Council Finds Time Too -Hard
To Purchase Automobile Truck
MAYOR GETS INCREASE
OF $2U FOR SERVICUE
Wednesday Meeting of City Fathers
Is Source of Disappointment to the
Volunteer Fire ComplVy
The city council, at its "meeting
on last Wednesday, politely 'pro
ceeded to "murder' 'the fire truck
proposition, which had been in the
balance for the last several weeks.
A delegation from the fire com
pany, composed of volunteers,
stormed the city council in be half
of the measure, but a motion for in
definite postponement proved to be
exceedingly popular, being passed
unanimously.
It had been the hope of the fire
company, and some of the members
of the city council that the city
would purchase the truck, but af
ter an investigation of the proposi
tion it was ascertained that the city
was in no financial position to
make the purchase at this time.
Another important move by the
council was the increasing of the
mayor's salary from $750 to $1000
per year., This measure had been
.ut` before the city coiuncil re
peatedly and was finally given the
a-iimous approval, of. the -live
members..
It is indeed a source of disap
pointment to the many citizens 'and
taxpayers who were anxious to see
the city purchase an automobile
truck, to find that the propsition,
which had been entertained for
such a long time should be tu-rned
down. It" may be several`: years,
now, before the volunteer fire com
pany, which works so energetically
and faithfully at all times, will
have the pleasure of having an aiuto
truck to fight the fires. -
GARDEN CITY, G''tJE
TWO. GAME$ FIOM LOCALS
Tuesday's Gtaune Is only o`e Won
-a By '110 Opethsse OL M
Visiting Tem
Garden City clptured two games:
of the three game series between
Opelousas and Garden .City during
Sunday, Monday and Tueasday. The
gamnes were splendid ehinbitions of
bone-head plays, errors and such
other features, which go to make
up a real baseball feast.,
- The only game to be Won h:byOF°
lousas was that on .'uesday;, .wen:
Bienvenu pitche his .first gane.of
the series; that game went to the!
locals by a score of 10 to 4 and It
was the only one qof the serides In
which the home boys showed some i
class, although a few bad `plays
were made.
The Sunday and Monday games,
were easy for Garden City, being:
won by big scores.
Bienvenn did not pitch as, well as.i
he has been doitig, but.he had the
visitors at his mercy at all times,i
which probatbly accounts for his
easy pitching..
To-morrow's game between.
Broussard and Opelousas promises
to. be a corking one, as the locals
are in splendid trim, the entire team
being in the pitk of conditio..
Broussard is rated as one of the i
best clubs in this portion of thle,'
state, having beaten everything ini
sight during the last few weeks,
Some of the best players in ama
teur ball are on.the Broussard club, i
and as Opelousas has been bolstered
up a real exciting game will be
witnessed at Wallior race track, to- i
morrow afternoon,
GEORGE WI0GUT
Tli. Clarion inadvertently omit.
ted to chronicle the death of George
.Wright, which took place in New.
Orleans on Saturday of last week.
Mr. Wright was buried in Opelou
sas on Sunday afternoon.
In Iota, \Vhic-h place Mr. Wright
lived for many years, the deceased
was known and regarded as one of
the most charitable, enterprising
and progressive citizens, and his
death came as a distinct shock es
pecially to the citizens of that por
tion of Acadia, who loyved and _ .
mired Mr.' Wright.
The deceased was alsol well
known in Opelousas, being sab.t
er-in-law of our distinguished
townsman, Hon. William 3. Sandoz.
The Clarion deplores tie fact
that it failed to chronicle the death
of such a splendid son of Louisiana
and we trust thatthe bereaved fam
ily will readily uoerstand that i'
was not done intentionally. We ex
tend our condolenece to the grief
stricken family.
