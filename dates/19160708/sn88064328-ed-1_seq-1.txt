KILLING A GREAT PARTY.

shall we hud more ot them than
5, *1 „ 1 • 11 rp 1 ,
in the letter 111 which 1 heodore
J Roosevelt undertakes to surrender
j his partv to the Old Guard?
E\ery syllable here uttered in
justification of the Progressive
movement belies his argument in
favor of the dissolution of that
organization an«5 his support of
Mr. Ilughes. The very men who
ruled the Kepublicaii Party in
• w j ,e ^ i,r - Roosevelt de
non need it as boss-ridden and
pri\ llege-controlled, are its inns
ters to-day, with the same aims
and the same methods, a. k Hhey |
are all applauding him. '
It is not possible to read this
capitaulation without loss of re
spect for the author. It is the
final act in what must be regarded
as the deliberate betrayal of a
party and a cause. It shows that
so far as Mr. Roosevelt is con
cerned he had four years ago no
inspiration higher than the mean
est of revenges upon Mr. Taft, and
envy and hatred of'Mr* ' Wilson
Mââ. I
ÂÎ" hU ab ° S ° ° f
The Progressive Party has been !
put to the base epd of serving a
disappointed man's personal |
grudges. Its recent convention I
was permitted to name a
r™e!« eomeTio ,!L
« ?
candi
date who never intended to run
«xcept as the nominee of the reg
ulars, and it was forced to ad
journ without naming a candidate
of its own who would run. It was
stupefied with untruths and prom
ises, trapped in its own household
and delivered to its enemies, ac
cording to programme. By a vote
of two to one last evening its Na
tional Committee ratified the
Derfidy.
Aside from proof of his politi
cal faithlessness and his malice
toward the President, Mr. Roose
velt's letter is a blank except for
his mania for war. Having
• j j
abandoned every principle" on
tV hl^h h A mO/1A n in no««nU ««««am
I which he made his assault upon
Mr. Taft, he offers nothing now
in his assault upon Mr. Wilson but
the impudent assumption that Mr.
Hughes would be a war-making
J President. Whether Mr. Hughes
î agrees to this classification or not,
it certainly is implied in the de
nunciation of Mr. Wlison as
"weak and vacillating" for keep
ing the peace under crushing ditti
culties and the praise of Mr.
Hughes as a man of "vigor and
force" who would have acted dif
ferently.
On this point the candidate is
entitled to be heard for himself.
In fairness he must not be held
responsible for the ravings of de
feated ambition unless he shall
make them his own. Should it
appear that as the price of Oyster
Bay favor Mr. Hughes has ac
Icepted Mr. Roosevelt's idea that
war with Germany, war with Tur
key, war with Mexico, war with
anybody and everybody, is the
only way in which this Nation can
"find its soul," several millions of
Americans will insist upon know
ing the exact terms of a very com
promising
Political parties sometimes dis
I solve or make alliances of their
own motion, but even so, the de
cision of their representatives
binds nobody who is unwilling. A
political party that is wrecked by
false lights and false leaders loses
all power of cohesion and is re
duced to its original elements.
Probably there never was a great
er delusion than the belief that
Mr. Roosevelt in retirement or a
rump committee sitting in secret
could deliver the true Progres
sives of the country to a hide
bound party of privilege and
6Teed from which they long-ago
separated for cause. No matter
what Mr. Roosevelt says or a dis
credited committee does, the quar
rels Begun yesterday in Chicago
will -be settled only at the polls
in November, where Democrats
and Progressives will meet Re
publican reactionaries as in former
days, all without disguse.—New

indigenous to New Orleans or

Of course along with the sub

in turn the protection of the
Canal Zone from other virulent

with the development of com

moose party and informed his
executive com mitte that in his
opinion that party is dead. And,
in conclusion, he has said that
he will support Hughes because
he thinks Hughes can beat Wil

say was that he was disgusted
with the bull moosers becaase
they failed to bluff the Pro

When first discovered, Texas
consisted mostly of cosmic junk,
including cactus, rattlesnakes,
homed toads, tarantulas and four
Later the
greaser, a species of human in
vented 'bv the Spaniards, moved
in and the rattlesnake^ moved
north in search of bettefWdety.
In the past seventy years, how
ever. erreat improvements have
been made. The cact-us. which
formerly grew over the State so
thickly that it was impossible for
a citizen to fall off his horse
without puncturing himself in
11,000 places, is now being re
placed by onion beds, cattle
ranches and corner lots and the
horned toads and other horrors
have been used to promote Pro
hibition campaigns with marked
success.
Texas raises cotton, rice, steers
and Démocratie majorities in tre
mendous quantities. It is as nat
ural for a Texan to b e a Demo
crat as it is for a Japanese to be
slant-eyed. Republicans are so
scarce in the State that it is some
times necessary to appoint Demo
cratic postmasters. The State
is Governed bv a Legislature of
great firmness and industry,
whose greatest diversion is regu
lating corporations and railroads
It has resrulated the latter so
carefullr that it now takes three
eornoration counsels to run a
freight train across the State
without incurring $1,000.000 in
fines. The society for the pre
vention of cruelty to railroad
presidents is growing rapidly
throughout the State.
The metropolis of Texas is San
Antonio, the most interesting
foreign city in the United States.
It is being pushed hard by Dal
las and Houston, little cities with
deep bass voices, and by Galves
ton. which was wept away by a
tidal wave fourteen years ago,
hut which has come back and
now dares the gulf to do it again.

WHAT THANKS DO YOU GIVE
HER! .
She spent a long, hot hour get
ing it. And you thought it was
a fine meal. But did you take a
second to tell her so?
Maybe she was so pleased
watching you enjoy her cooking
that she didn't eat much herself.
(Notice the woman who do the
cooking in hot weather, and you '11
see that they haven't much appe
tite.) But she was quick to see
when you needed a second help
ing.
Maybe, when you had finished,
.you lighted your cigar, and
picked up the evening paper, and
went out to the front porch. And
you felt perfectly complacent in
the assurance that you had com
pleted a good day's work.
But her work was not done.
She had to go out into the stuffy
kitchen and spend another hour
over the steaming dishpan.
And she didn't get even a tip
for her trouble.
Not that she wanted it. What
she wanted was something like
this :
Gee, Flo! that was a dandy
dinner. Bet nobody in this street
had a better!"
What will your little word of
appreciation mean to her?
The difference 'between tears
and smiles over that measly dish
pan ; the difference between a
song mixed with the rattling of
the dishes, and a sob hidden by
the scouring of the kettles.
Such a little thing for you to
say. so much for her to hear.
Women are like that. Do you
ever stop to think, u.an, that un
less you take a little pains to put
some joy into the life of the wo
man who is your wife, she isn't
going to have any too much of
it?—Shrevcport Times.
