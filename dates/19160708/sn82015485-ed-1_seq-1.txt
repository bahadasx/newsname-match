This month brought us the reminder of when
our nation started its existence.
We are reminded on all sides of the value of
keeping our nation to its right condition as it was
when it stai ted.
As the nation is made up of each of us and
our condition affects the others, hence to be our best
is what is expected of us.
An account in our savings department is . a
preparation for the expected and unexpected events
of the future.
, If you are not so prepared now is the time to
do so.

Tourist Club Turns Over Library
To the City
Whereas: The Tourist Club or
Wa-Keeney organized and maintain
ed a Public Library, until such time
as the city of Wa-Keeney could take
over and maintain said library:
And whereas: The city of Wa
Keeney has voted to establish and
maintain a public library and has
voted the tax provided therefor by
law.
Therefore, be it resolved: That
the Tourist Club of Wa-Keeney, now
will turn over to the city of Wa
Keeney for a city library the books,
book stacks, book cases, shelves and
other property, belonging to the said
library. With tne provision that the
mayor always appoint, at least two
members from the Tourist club upon
the Library Board.
SHORT HISTORY OF THE LIBRARY
Wa-Keeney, Kansas June 30, 1916.
On November the 24th, 1905. The
Tourist Club of Wa-Keeney voted ta
each present a book or prevail 'pou
some friend to give one as a neucleus
for a city library, whereupon the
work of giving and soliciting grew to
uch an extent that March 30, 1916,
-was made the date for presenting the
books to the library but the meeting
being postponed until April 7th that
became the date of the organization
of the Wa-Keeney library with 80
volumes not counting the govern
ment official reports. Mrs. Knudson
was the first librarian. From this
start the library has grown to now
892 books besides many sets of mag-1
azines, Fooles Index for six years and
the readers guide. The Locust Club
and the Ellis Club donated generous
' ly as did many people in and out of
town so that when the club voted to
give the library and library equip
ment to the city on June 30, 1916, for
a Free Public Library there is a good
collection of books in good condi
tion. And we hope the citizens will
continue the interest for the welfare
.of the library.

THE DOWNTRODDEN PRINTER
All over the state the country
papers are falling into line and ad
vancing their subscription price.
And it is high time, too, that the
newspaper were waking up. Every
thing used in a printing office has
increased in price from twenty-five
to sixty per cent, and as yet the end
is not in sight. People are paying
increased prices for everything ihey
buy with the exception of newspap
ers. The war in Europe is directly
responsible for the advance in paper
and printing material. Rags, the
raw material from which much of
the paper stock is made, are also us
ed in the manufacture of high ex
plosives, and the price of rags has
been hoisted out of sight by shell
manufacterers. French bleach and
many other necessary chemicals can
scarcely be purchased at any price,
and the paper mills see no relief in
sight Tor many many months. Up to
date the Optimist has been absorb
ing the increased cost of paper, ink,
printer's rollers and a dozen other
items, and we believe we could con
tinue to put out a paper for $1.00 a
year if our subscribers all paid their
subscription accounts in advance. At
the present time we are carrying five
or six hundred dollars in subscription
accounts on our books, and that is an
awful load when the high cost of
printing a newspaper is taken into
consideration. We're almost per
suaded to do three things: Cut every
delinquent off the list, raise the price
to $1.50 per year, and collect it in ad
vance under any and all circumstan
ces. If it becomes necessary to do
this we shall give our patrons at least
thirty days notice in advance

There are harvest "hands" and also
"harvesters," and is a wide differ
ence in them. The former takes the
first job that is offered at fair wages
and is proud of the opportunity to
render value received; glad to be use
ful to himself and others. The lat
ter is different. He makes demands
and expects to achieve by conquest
rather than by fair and equitable ex
change of favors.
It seems to the writer of this par
agraph that a mistake is made in our
methods of securing harvest help.
Weeks in advance of harvest, word
is sent out and published broadcast,
giving estimates of the number need
ed and the probable wages in differ
ent communities generally too hteh

THE ROMANCE OF HARVESTING
This is a story of the fairy. It4 is
more interesting than the tales of
the Arabian Nights, and more thrill
ing than the Adventures fl Situ bad,
the sailor. ' f
For 50,000 years men saved the
wheat crops with the old hand sickle.
Every bushel of wheat required three
hour of a man's life to produce it.
The fcradle came and took the sickle's
place, lasting about seventy-five
year4 to lighten the burdens of the
grairf growers. In the year laei-ithe
famous year in the world's history,
Cyrus -H. McCormick ' was born the
year'Lincoln and Darwin were born
two fether liberators of the race. He
gavefto the world the self binding
harvester,. It reduced the time to
produce a bushel of wheat to ten
mindtes. Men thought for years the
last thought had been given. It had
revolutionized small grain farming.
and made the United States the gran
ary of the world. It may be hard for
us to believe it, but the main object
or man for the last 10.000 years, had
been to get bread. Famine was al
ways stalking near the people in
those days.
Only kings and their retinues had
enough bread to eat. It is no exag
geration to say that the world was
hungry for countless centuries. Black
bread was food for the common man.
Eve the nations that gave to the
worfd Galileo, Laplace and Newton
were always seeing the ghosts of hun
ger ntil McCormick came. We had
thought that this man had userhed in
the IMillenium of Prosperity. He
had.j He will live among the immor
tals )t history.
But the last word was not said nor
the last basic notion had not been
thought by McCormick, as most men
had ( supposed. About eight years
ago a Kansas boy dreamed that he
could construct a machine that would
thresh the grain while stand ing.leav
ing the straw on the ground, elimin
ating the header barge, the threshing
machine crew and . all the burdens
that need must fall upon the farmers
wife and daughters. On last Wed
nesday we -witnessed the dream of
eigttOyears ago in action.- We "mi
the standing grain thresher at' work.'
We saw tfte call of the farmers an
swered. Wei saw the work of
McCormick out distanced,' and what
had revolutionized harvesting of the
last half of the nineteenth century
and perfected in the first of the
twentieth century taking its place
along the side of the sickle, cradle,
Marsh h arvester, and Osborne wire
binder I mean the McCormick twine
binders and headers. While we will
not forget the benefactors of the pas';
but let us not cling to the traditions
of ancient days, but take hold of this
"new thought" that originated in
Kansas, press the opportunity and
gladly recognize the new inventor,
Curtis C. Baldwin of Nickerson.
We went to the Experimental Sta
tion, the largest one of its kind in
the world, to watch this machine
make its showing. It was started in
a field of tough, half ripe rye, much
of it still in the dough. Four mules
were hitched to the machine, the
gasoline engine was started, the
wheels obeyed the applied power, the
cylinder speeding up to about 800 rev
olutions and the thresher was pushed
into the grain passing across one end
of the field and at least three hun
dred men watched it work. After
reaching the south side of the plot
the machine stopped, men gathered
around, making comments as to the
results, but one and all agreed it
would work. .The machine may not
be perfect in its construction, but it j
does perfect work. j
We are free to say it is the " most j
far reaching, revolutionary piece ofi
machinery that has been given to the !
agricultural world in the last eighty
joars. Perhaps it will add more to
the happiness of man, conserve the
soil better and make it possible for
more people through the world to
eat white bread than any invention
that has been given to man during
the long roll of time A. S. Hale

Yea! Anderson Should B Vsry

We have been wondering what Max

Were the press to tell the facts rela

KEEP OFF BULLETS
A movable bullet proof, to protect
soldiers in close hard fighting, has
been invented by Alfred S. Bailey,
a Reno county farmer, who lives 8
miles southeast of Hutchinson.
Mr. Bailey received a patent for his
new machine on June 13th and this
is the first time the general pubic
has been told any of the details con
cerning it.
It has been the problen ever since
the evolution of modern warfare to
find some protection for men against
rifle fire. It has been admitted, that
if such protection could be found,
that present day fightng would be
revolutionized.
It is possible to protect a man with
armor so that he cannot be struck by
bullets, but the armor will be too
heavy for the man to move.
Mr. Bailey will solve the problem
with his bullet proof.
The front of this is a sheet of steel,
.15 of an inch treated armor plate,
which will turn the bullet of the
modern army rifle at any range. '
The front of the machine is a sheet
of this steel 10 feet long and feet
high. It extends 4 feet bade. . The i
bullet proof is mounted on steel
wheels, with roller bearings. The
front plate may be propped level to
the ground by levers, or it can be
raised 3 feet off the ground tor trans
portation. It is guided by a rudder
wheel inside of the shield.
When the shield is In action; there
is a rack which comes down three
feet from the top, making the shield
a double decker, and available for
9 men on each deck. The loopholes
are on a ball and socket joint making
it impossible for an enemy's bullet to
penetrate the shield. The shield
weighs 900 pounds, or 50 pounds to
the man in action.
Mr. Bailey has the shield equipped
with a chemical contrivance which
will cut any wire entanglements en
countered. -
He has already interested the Ca
nadian, English and French govern
ment with his shield, and is now try
ing to interest the United States.
