The Sid'iy attractionl at the Gem
will be "o 1rietr it ove." a drama
of daring nittiii'y veal.ing the won
derful power of mother-love, as pih
trized il live tinatioiial acts from'
the celebrated s.tory by William Le
uex Regina ladet, the gifted
emotional actress, portrays the lead
ing role, that of "Sadunah the Dan

"What Happened at 22."
To employ a descriptive phrase
which has grown hackneyed through
misapplication, this picture, which
comes to the Gem tonight, is "intense
ly interesting." These two words sum
up the contents of "What Happened
at 22" to a degree that hardly
needs any accessory elaboration.
The story deals with a pro
fessional forger, his activities and
his downfall, and while crime
is in a large sense responsible for
much of the intensiveness of the pic
ture, no evil-fearing censor need
worry over the outcome, for natural
ly crime goes down in the dust be
fire the strong arm of the law.
Added to the story of the capitula
tion of the forger is the romance of
Louise, a companion to the wife of
the criminologist, and the son of
the house. Frances Nelson and Ar
thur Ashley are featured. Miss Nel
son appears as Louise, while Mr. Ash
ley is the forger. The latter's acting
i:; better than anything he has done
before. Gladden James and Frank
Burbeck complete the cast with pleas
ing performances.
"What Happened at 22" will stand
up successfully before any audience,
no matter how critical. The story is
full of action, which is plentiful in
its elements of suspense, and as pie
turized under the direction of Geo.
Irving, whose productions are always
e ceedingly worthy, it provides a film
entertainment of unusual merit and
dramatic excellen.ce.

Theodore ttoberts in "PudJ'nhead
Wilson."
In producit'g Mark Twain's famous
work,"Pudd'tihe:d Wilson,"the Lasky
Feature Play Company presents the
first of a ,eries of picturizations of
the noted humorist's novels. "Pudd'n
head Wilson" comes to the Grand
Monday, and will be followed by
"Tom Sawyer." lHalukleberry Finn"
and others.
"Pudd'nhead Wilson" occupies a
umique plact. in the annals of Ameri
can humorowu literature. Its story
said to have been the first piece of
fiction which made use of the now
familiar finger-print method as a
means or establishing identity-is
melodramatic, romantic and suffused
with a deep note of human sympathy
and interest. "Pudd'nhead Wilson,"
the southern lawyer from whom the
book takes its title, is a character in
American literature, and his crisp
sayings will live forever.
No actor of the stage or screen is
So well suited to the role of "Pudd'n
iead Wilson" as Theodore Roberts,
Amnrica's leading screen character1
stur. Mr. Roberts brings out the
subtle humor of Wilson, who swayed
a whole community by his personality
during an exciting trial, finally estab
lishing the innocenci of a youth un
justly accused. There is a gripping
love story through the photopliay.
"The F urth EtatE-" a Vivid Neaj
paper Play.
News-'not inr its concrete form,
hut in all its miany phases-is the
keynote of "Thi Fourth Estate," a
William Fox photoplay starring Sarm
oil .1. !yan, Rut Blair and Clifford
trove, which wil he shown Tuesday
at the Grand. The play reeks of
news, and "reek$ " is used intention
ally in defiance pf any existing law
of diction. No 'lsser word would do.
The production,. does not savor of
news, nor teem pith news, nor hinge
on news. It reeks with news--news
and the multipl agencies employed
in its collection, publication and dis
tribution.
Few newspaper photoplays have
met success bec use of their glaring
infidelity to aettal conditions. "The
Fourth Estate," however, has been
purged of inco istencies. Its scenes I
were made in the offices and the me
chanical departments of the Chicago ,
Herald, and the bhtmosphere of news-!
paperdom-- that gnmysterious, little
known realm in which thousands labor
that-millions may know the daily en
tries in the world's diary-has been
faithfully recorded.
No other profession or industry---,
call it which you will-has so many
diversified types as newspaper mak
ing. No other vecation so completely
humanizes its Workers, those super
energized men awl women whose sole
purpose in life it to emancipate from
chaos the news of the day. All of
these types are portrayed in "The
Fourth Estate."

besides the manuy other types found
in the news and mechanical ends of
the present-day paper..
"The Fourth Estate'" is founded on
the famous stage .success of the same
mame written by Joseph Medill Pat

Chicago Trib: , and is proclaimed
to be not only gr-eatest newspaper

"The M1arriage 4 Kitty" and "The
Cheat," will be seen-as "Tennessee"
in the photodram tlzation of the fa
mous story, "Te isee's Pardner,"
at the Grand next Wedrnesday.
The heroine of the story is a little
girl of sixteen whose father had been
murdered when: he was p child, while
on the way to California with his
family in search of gold, and whose
mother had eloped with the assassin.
Little "Tennessee" is taken care of
by Jack Hunter, a homeless boy, who
makes her his partner in anything he
may gain. Ha- leaves the baby with a
priest until she reaches the age of
sixteen. Then, as he has discovered
the famous Nugget mine, he make.:
"Tennessee" a half owner and sends
for her. He has always kept up the
deception that "Tennessee's"father is
still alive, .and when the gri arrives
at the little -town of -Saiidy Bar in
seach of hei "Daddy," he has not thy
heart to tell her the real truth.
Romaine, the man who killed "Ten

decides to wiin her love and steal her
fortune. How affair; are finally ad

'Tlie cast supporting Miss Ward is
I one of unusual excellence and con

From a photographic standpoint
tiie production is said to be unusual,
thie company having spent many days
in the rugged Sierras for the filming
of the beautiful exterior scenes. The
Lasky Company considers "Tennes

lni: Claire, who is undoubtedly the
foremost American star of her age,
makes her motion picture debut in
iThe Wild Goose Chase," a charming
romantic comedy by Wm. C. DeMille,
which will be the Friday offering at

"T'the Wild Goose Chase" is the love

i.S NATIONAL REPUTATION.
Ur, DU.wha.n Recognized as Leader in
Ptill' ttcHalth.Work.
Sito.iº a a, Ihii, . Tiibuna-, May 2:.
Lr. h.arles V. Chapin, health com
oin .sinei of - Providence, Rhode 1
land, and a snitarian of recognized
ability and long experience, has re
cenitly conducted an investigation of
the variious state departments of
hi aith,
His conclusions are embodied in a
report of -tate public health work is
:.ed % ithin the last few weeks.
Judged by this report some of the
stater are very much alive to the ne
cessity of.conserving the health of the
people, while certain others leave
such matters very laigely to indi
vidual initiative.
Speaking generally, the older
states have developed the best depart
menu: of health. Again, it is notice
able that, also speaking generally,
the be-.. departments are in those
:sates in which, by reason of the de
velopment of great manufacturing
and commercial enterprises, a large
proportion of the people live in cities.
In rural communities the conservation
of health can be left to individual in
itiative without causing such disas
trous results or disastrous results so
easily appreciated.
1Ty reason of this we oind that,
again speaking generally, the agricul
tural states have not kept pace in the
developnienit of their state depart
ments of health.
Another deterring influence in near
ly every state. but much more in some
than in others, is the tendency to dis
miss trained health officers and to re
place them with green, untrained
men (for -they are not sanitarians)
with every change of administration.
Speaking of one state, Dr. Chapin
says:
*Polities are said to dictate ap
pointmn -nts to the state board of
health. If this is so permanency of
tenure for the executive, and perhaps
his subordinates, can never be secure,
and no matter how efficient an of
hcial may be, the whirligig of politics
may displace him in a moment and
reverse the policy of the department
and destroy its influence. (The in
cubus of easily preventable disease
lie: so heavy on the south that no
southern. tate can afford to allow
party or personal politics to exist in
the department of health.) The peo
ple should dedand that no governor
ofBel ~y mana a doere'
himself above all petty politics."
Thi Liiticism appliec to every sec
tion Of the country. It i as true in
the north a:, in the south. The state
ments. quot d v ere in the chapter de
voted to the Louisiana health depart
iment.
Witsir a year iftei they w -e writ
ttn Louinsia E lteced a new governor.
i P5werful political interest; are exert
nig then elves to displace the present
eflicient president of the state board
of health arid to replace him with a
man without tiaining in sanitation or
experienta in protecting a people
against disease.
The reputation of Louisiana as a
:tuate where proper health work is be
ing done -has greatly enhanced since
Dr. Oscar Dowling became the state
health officer.
As such he-has a national reputa
tion, and the state has capitalized and
is capitalizing on that reputation.
People from other sections of the
country feel a little more tempted to
move to Louisiana when they know of
the good reputation borne by Dr.
I owlfng and the other members of
the state ho:,rd.
Naturally the people of the state
vwould be expected to visit their ven
~e..nCt on any officer who wiuld turn
thlie state board of health o .r to tn
..raled and untried men.

A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE.
"Battle Cry of Peace" Comparable
to "Birth of a Nation."
Both from a spectacular and tn ed
ucational viewpoint, "The Battle Cry
of Peace," which will be presented at
the Elks' Theatre in Baton Rouge to
day and tomorrow, afternoon and
night, is a very remarkable entertain
ment. Comparing it with "The Birth
of a Nation" is inevitable, and it is
the opinion of many who have seen
both that "The Battle Cry of Peace"
is in every way entitled to stand with
the Griffith production as the two
greatest triumphs of the motion pic
ture art.
As with "The Birth of a Nation,"
music has been arranged to accom
pany the picture.
This engagement is particularly
timely; as the whole country is deep
ly engrossed in the movement for
preparedness and it will convert to
the cause many persons who other
wise would not have been torn from
the paciticist faction.
the Battle Cry" requires about
two hours and three-quarters in the
Lellinig. The pictures were made by
the V itagraph Company, and the cast
includes Charles Richman, Norma
Talmadge, and a dozen other stars of
tilmdom.
The individual acting is excellent,
but the picture does not make its
greatest appeal through the acting of
any one player, or group of players,
but through the presentation of great
scenes, in which thousands upon thou'
sand.; take part. Apparently three or
dour times as many persons were
used in the "Battle Cry" as in "The
Birth of a Nation."
There is a lavish waste of money in
the piece, too. Dozens of buildings
are destroyed-not mere shacks built
for the purpose, but great structures
that required big guns to level. There
is a head-on train collision, and a
battle at sea, in which a dreadnaught
is sunk after a fierce encounter.
There are dozens of aeroplanes, scores
of battleships, many regiments of in
fantry and tens of thousands fleeing
from New York city when the enemy
approaches. An attack on New York
with Broadway in a panic is realistic
ally shown.
"The Battle Cry of Peace" is a won
derful picture, and is destined to have
I as successful a run in Baton Rouge as
"The Birth of a Nation."
