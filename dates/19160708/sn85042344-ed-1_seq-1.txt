In a settlement of the differences be

tonight a suggestion from General

ceed. State department officials be
lieve more can be accomplished
through informal conferences be
tween Ellseo Arredondo, Mexican am
bassador designate, and Frank L.
Polk, acting secretary of slate, than
by a more formal exchange of views.
They are willing to accede, however,
to some other plan should the de
facto government propose it.
Sends N'olc lo Mexico,
Mr. Arredondo transmitted to his
government today a brief and friendly
note from Secretary Lansing express
ing gratification over the turn affairs
betwen the two governments lias
taken and accepting proposals for
diplomatic selllement of points in dis
pute. The comniuiiicat ion was ap
proved by the cabinet before It wits
sent to the Mexican embassy. The
text follows:
"Sir: I have the honor to acknowl
edge the receipt of your communica
tion of July 4, IDlfi. in which you
transcribed a note addressed to me by
the secretary of foreign relations of
your government und lo request that
you will transmit to him the follow
ing reply:
Mr. Secretary: I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of vour
courteous note transmitted lo mo bv
Senor Arredondo on tho fourth instant
in which you refer to my notes of
lone 20 and 2!i and to assure you of
the sincere gratification of my gov-
nment at the frank statement of Ibe
difficulties which have unfortunately
arisen in our relations along the In
ternational boundary and tho unre
served expression of the desire of your
government to reach an adjustment of
these difficulties on a broad and amlc
able basis. The same spirit of friend
ship and of solicitude for continuance
of cordial relations betwen our two
countries Inspires my government
which equally desires an Immediate
solution of the matters of difference
which have long vexed both govern
ments.
'It Is especially pleasing to mv gov
ernment that the de facto government
of Mexico Is disposed to give quick
as well as practical consideration In a
spirit of concord to tho remedies
which may be applied to the existing
onditlons. Reciprocating the same
desire, the government of the United
States Is prepi red Immedialelv to ex
change views as to a practical plan
to remove finally and prevent a recur
rence of the difficulties which have
been the source of the controversy.
Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed

Must Remedy Conditions.
Officials did not fall to note Hic-
retarv Ionising had laid stress upon
the deslnilsllty of giving quick and
practical consideration to the im
mediate conditions along the border
which have been a source of con
troversy. The language of the com
munication plainly Indicates a speedy
solution of that problem will be
sought, whatever time may be al
lowed afterward to find a means of
aiding the de facto government In re
storing normal economic condition."
throughout Mexico. The definition
of the border dispute submitted by
eneral Carranza In his note sug
gesting negotiations for a settlement
apparently has been found acceptable
by the Washington government. This
lrtuaily narrows the immediate oh
jective of the negotiators to consider
atlrns of the "reasonable" anxiety of
the United States for the security of
its frontier on the one hand and the
desire of the de facto government for
early withdrawal of American troops
from Mexico on the other.
Warning of Pandlls.
Additional evidence of the more
friendly attitude of the tirranra gov
ernment came today in tho form of a
warning transmitted at the direction
of Genera! Carranza that bandits
which recently defeated government
troops at Corralltos were beaded to
ward the Pig Pend region In Texas
At the same time the state denarl-
ment received a report from an
American In Mexico that he had seen
and talked with Villa near Corralitos
few days Is-fore the fight reported
in the Carranza message.
Offiefals were pleased at the Indl-
atlon that General Carranza was dls-
oseu to seek co-operation in nrolect.
ing the border. Thew saw in the
warning, however, a frank admission
that bandits still are active In the
territory over which the de facto gov
ernment repeatedly has claimed com
plete military control. This mav
have an Important bearing on the
diplomatic discussions. The state de.
partment received Information today
that many Americans who hastened in
the border or the seacoast when the
crisis seemed grave, already are re
turning to tho Interior of Mexico. De
partment officials are using every ef
fort to dissuade them from " this
course.

Since Lyon quit sending out these

While the law does say that the
