feet deeper. This would re
quire u tunnel 1,000 feet long.
Most of the old time miners
in the canyon are confident
that the Belorphan has solved
the mystery of the source of
the thousands of dollars worth
of float picked up in the Mary
Ellen Gulch and are equally
confident that by drifting,
shoots of sensationally rich ore
will be encountered.

HORSESHOE GROUP :
TO BE DEVELOPED
J. W, Johnson was In American

rangements to commence work on his
Horseshoe group lying north and ad
joining the Pacific property on tho
north sido of the Canyon. Thoro is
already a tunnel In 130 feet nnd by
driving It about 300 feot further It Is
Intended to cut a strong mlnorallzcd
flssuro nt n point where It cuts
tho llmo shnlo contact nnd whoro It
self Is cut with a porphry dyko, nnd
unusual condition mid u place where
experts have said tho oro should be

Mr. Johnson says ho may liavo tho
Pacific flssuro, but what ho Is driving
for Is tho Ilorscshoo fissure.
