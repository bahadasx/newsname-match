Some Other Way Of Car
ranza's May Be Better
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 7. In contem
plation of the diplomatic conversation;
which it is hoped will result in a set
rtlement of differences between the
L'nited States and the de facto gov
ernment of Mexk'j, officials awaited
tonight a suggestion from General Car
ranza as to how they should proceed.
State department officials believe
more can be accomplished thi'ough in
formal conferences between Eliseo
Arredondo and Frank L. Polk, acting
secretary of state, than by a more
formal exchange f views.
They are willing to acceed, how
ever, to some other plan should the
de facto government propose it.
Lansing's Friendly Missile.
Mr. Arreii'jndo transmitted to his
government today a brief and friend
ly note handed to him by Secretary
Lansing, expressing gratification over
the turn affairs between the two gov
ernments have taken and accepting
proposuls 'r diplomatic settlement of j
points in dispute. The communica
tion was approved bv the cabinet be
fore it. a as sent to the Mexican em
bassy. The text follows:
"Sir: I have the li'jnor to acknow
ledge the receipt of your communica
tion of July 4, 1916. in which you
transcribe a note addressed to me by
the Secretary of Foreign Relations of
your government and to request that
you will transmit to me the following
reply:
Most Courteous.
"Mr. Secretary:
"I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your courteous notej
transmitted t'j me by Senor Arredondo j
on the 4th instant, in which you refer'
. ' , 1
to express the sincere gratification of
my government at the frank state
ment of the difficulties which have
unfortunately arisen in our relations
along the international boundary, and
the unreserved expression of the de
sire of your government to reach an
adjustment of these differences V)n a
broad and amicable basis. The spirit
cf friendship and of solicitude for the
cordial relations between our two
countries inspires my government
which equally desires an immediate
solution of the matters of difference
which have long vexed both govern-;
nients.
Talks of Remedies.
"It is especially pleasing to my gov
ernment that the de facto government
of Mexico is disposed to give Quick
consideration a spirit of concord to
the remedies which may be applied
to the existing, conditions. Recipro
cating these desires the government
of the L'nited States hopes to find
some pracucai pian l0 remove unaiiy
and prevent a recurrence of the ,
differences which have been the
source of the controversy.
"Accept. Mr. Secretary, the renewed
assurances of my highest considera
tion. I am Sir,
"Yours very sincerely,
(Signed) "ROBERT LANSING."
Not Much to Mediate.
The language of the communication
plainly intimates that a speedy solu
tion of that problem will be sought
whatever time may be allowed after-!
ward to find a means of aiding the de
iacto government in restoring normal
economic conditions throughout ?.Iex
ico. The definition of the border dis
pute submitter by General Carranza in
nis note suggesting negotiations for a
settlement apparently has been found
acceptable by the Washington govern
ment. This virtually narrows the im
mediate object of the negotiators to
consideration 01 the "reasonable anxi
ety of the United States for the se
curity of its frontier, on one hand,
and the desire of the de facto govern
ment for the early withdrawal of
American troops from Mexican terri
tory." Warning Pleases U. S.
Additional evidence of the more
friendly attitude of the Carranza gov
ernment came today in the form of
a warning communicated by Mr. Ar
redondo to the state department at
the direction of General Carranza in
connection with the battle between
Villa and Carranza forces at Corral

Fewer Cases Reported. Hope
Held Epidemic Is Under
Hand. Philadelphia Has 3
Cases
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. July 7. Health au
thorities of New York decided late
tonight to abandon for the present at
least, a plan decided upon in the af-
ternoon, to appeal to the American
Red Cross for nurses to aid in stamp
ing out the scourge of infantile para
lysis which, since June 1, has caused
196 deaths among children. Health
Commissioner Emerson said he was
now of the opinion it would not be
necessary to ask for outside aid as
the hospitals of the city have agreed
to extend their ' help more freely.
Some encouragement was found in
the fact that fewer new cases were
. reported today than on
Wednesday.
Dr. Emerson declared that one of
the steps be had decided upon was
that of prosecution of physicians who
iiave failed to report cases they have
attended.
Children's reading rooms
in the
ordered
measure
public libraries have been
.. . ,.
iblic libi
closed as a precautionary
and the order barring children from
i the moving picture theatres will not
; be modified until conditions improve.
Playgrounds in various parts of the
city were ordered closed earlier in
the day.
Mothers were advisee to have their
children in the fresh air as much as
possible but to keep them away from
other children. Dr. Emerson frankly
admitted fiat his department has
been unable to determine the actual
canse of the epidemic. All theories
which have previously been held
have been disproved, he said. Proper
isolation seems to be the only hope
of preventing the spread of the dis
ease, be declared.
