OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
PREPAREDNESS
From 1866, the close of the civil
war, to 1885 the republicans were
in control of the government at
Washington.
In those 20 years congress ap
propriated $346,365,852.52 for the
navy.
When President Cleveland, the
first democratic president elected
since the civil war. took the oath
of office on March 4. 1885, the
American navy consisted of junk,
wooden ships with old guns and
broken down engines.
The American navy was a joke.
When President Cleveland went
out of office four years later the
United States had its first squad
ron of modern warships, the fa
mous "White Squadron," that
carried the American flag to Eu
rope and once more inspired re
spect for American seapower.
In a speech in the house only
the other day. Representative
Talbott, of Maryland, a member
of the Naval Affairs Committee,
recalled that Col. Roosevelt in his
administration, invited the demo
cratic members of the committee
to go to the White House that he
illicit ask them personally to
vote for four battleships. On
that occasion, said -Mr. Talbott,
Col. Roosevelt said:
"I am frank enough to admit
that we could not have carried
on the war with Spain success
fully except for the navy that was
furnished to the country during
Cleveland's two administrations."
fn 20 years the republican
party in congress had spent $419,
--510,887.09 of the people's money
aud had nothing to show for it.
Of this amount $73,145,034.57
represented unexpended balances
from appropriations of previotis
years. The money had been
wasted; it had gone to make con
tractors rich and to give employ
ment to men at political navy
yards to vote as their bosses
dictated.
In four years, Cleveland's a<l
ministration, the Democratic part}
spent $67,354,261.50 and had a
squadron of modern ships to show
for it. The money had been spent
honestly and not for the enrich
ment of favored contractors and
political bosses.
A democratic president, a demo
cratic secretary of the navy and
a democratic congress created the
modern American navy and took
the first step for PREPARED
NESS.
From 1897 to 1913—16 years—
the republicans were again in con
trol of the government.
They thought so little of the
navy they let it run down. It
was the old system over again of
favoritism and waste.
They could not see the wisdom
of being PREPARED.
But in those sixteen years they
spent $1,586,052,816.56.
The republicans admit that un
der their administrations the navy
had not been kept up to high
water mark and it was too weak
properly to protect the United
States against danger.
President Wilson came into of
fice on March 4, 1913.
In three years the democratic
congress has appropriated $54:5.-
K02,771.18 for the navy, and when
the program for which appropria
tions have been made at this ses
sion is completed the American
navy will be the SECOND MOST
POWERFUL NAVY IN TIIK
WORLD, with only England su
perior.
The republicans TALK. The
democrats ACT.
Republicans waste money. Dem
ocrats H|K'iid money efficiently.
If the country wants to feel
certain it is safe from attack anil
have its navy kept at the highest
point of efficiency it will vote for
the election of President Wilson
and a democratic congress.
The standpatters believe in be
ing prepared —-even for the worst.
The nations of the world may
be eager for peace, but the noise
they're making isn't in that di
rection.
The fact that the most reac
tionary of the standpat republi
cans in the nation are the loudest
in their praises for Hughes, ought
to be a fine reason for the pro
gressives accepting him too. That
is. the standpats think so.
Republicans are beginning to
understand the irony of Roose
vrlt's indorsement of Hughes.
Kiirlii years ago Roosevelt In
dorsed Taft, and thereby killed
the republican party, and it seemu
thai Roosevelt is now willing to
finish (he job.
Henry Meßridc, former gov
ernor of Washington, once a re
publican, then a progressive, and
now cidled a progressive-republi
can, seems to be in the lead for
the republican nomination for
yuvoriior. Geo. A. Lee, one of
♦he mainstays of the Hay admin
istration, is considered second in
Ihe race, his greatest strength
■Miming from the old-time organ*-
Kntion which has controlled this
Btate for years, and from the cor
porations. W. J. Button is the
only man from the east side who
is in the running, and expects to
gel a large vote from the east
side, but political prophets do not
invilict that he will make any
headway on the west side where
the bulk of the state's vote is
located.
The state of Washington led
i-wvy other state in the union in
lumber production in 1915. The
bulk of this production was from
the west side Yet when the ed
itor was on the Sound a few
weeks ago, lie found that the lack
of Shipping facilities absolutely
prevented the lumbermen from
selling to the besi foreign mar
kets and reaping the high prices
which other countries are willing
to pay.
The shipping hill which Presi
dent Wilson endeavored t<> have
passed by congress would have
enabled the state t<» reap a har
vest during the prevailing high
prices, hut republican blindness
killed the bill, and this state suf
fers.
From this one circumstance the
ideas of the Sound have changed
considerably towards Wilson.
Shingle men want a high tariff,
and will of course vote for the
ticket which promises such a tar
iff, but there are lots of business
men, ordinarily republican in pol
itices, who are looking askance
at their old leaders and wonder
ing if it were not better to sup
port Wilson—the. man who has
proved right on the ship bill.
Progressives have been very
strong on the Sound. Tacoina has
been a hotbed of progressivism.
But progressives are not letting
loose of their ideas as fast as re
publican organizations would wish.
The first state chairman of the pro
gressive party has declared his
intention of working for the dem
ocratic ticket this year, absolute
ly refusing to go back to the re
actionary element which lie left
four years ago.
L. Roy Slater, the present pro
gressive state chairman, .states
that the progressive organization
in this state will be kept alive,
and that although many Sound
progressives will vote for Wilson.
they will support Meßride for
governor.
Party lines are in confusion in
the west, but, from present ap
pearances the democratic |>arty
will emerge with a greater
strength than before.

The Registration
Registration for claims on the
Colville reservation opened in
Colville Wednesday morning at
12:01. There were 61 men in
line at the opening time, and
James Petty of Colville was the
first to raise his hand and be
sworn by Notary F. Y. Wilson
and have his application regis
tered. C. H. Pierce of Orient
was the second to register. By
noon Wednesday 450 filings were
received.
Registrations in Colville are
likely to go beyond all expecta
tions, and it will undoubtedly be
necessary for Colville to take steps
to house and feed the visitors.
Every one who has rooms which
can be let to strangers should
notify W. W. Campbell, secre
tary of the Chamber of Com
merce, so that accommodations
can be arranged. Colville can
not afford to lose her reputation
at this time, after working so
long to secure this registration
here. Railroads all report un
precedented interest in the reser
vation opening, and large ticket
sales, most of those from the
east being routed through to
Colville.
Colville's registration room is
immediately north of the Exam
iner office, on Main street. Thir
teen notaries care for the wants
of the public: L. B. Donley, F. Leo
Qrinstead, R. A. Thayer, L. M.
McFarland, H. T. Went/, W. L.
Sax, L. ('. Jesseph, W. Lon John
son, (>. W. Noble, H. W. McNiimar,
John 15. Slater, F. Y. Wilson, Mrs.
.lean Met'loud, the latter three be
ing respectively president, secre
tary and treasurer of the notaries'
association.
The registration room is open
day and night, the notaries being
divided into three shifts. The ap
plicant for registration pays 25c
In the cashier on entering the
room, then moves along the long
counter to some one of the notar
ies, who (ills out the registration
blank for the applicant, swears
him, appends his notarial seal,
puls the application in an envel
ope, seals it. and drops it into a
large locked metal can.
L. I). Pace, special inspector for
the land department, of Washing
tun. I). ('.. has direct charge of
the registration and is custodian
of the locked can containing the
applications. At the conclusion
of the registration July 22, he will
take the applications to Spokane
where applications from all the
registration points will be thor
oughly mixed, and the drawing
commenced July 27.
Among the Fourth of July and
roundup visitors to Colville this
week were several prominent in
the political world, most promi
nent among them being Former
