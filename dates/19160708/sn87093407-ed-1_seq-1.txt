Had it been truly a nonpartisanhip hill, even the

By Cornelia Glass
White river is today being draped for two dead bodies. One is a man and
the other is a little boy.
I here isn't much of a story in that.
Hundreds of men and hundreds of little boys have been drowned, and only
the hearts that were theirs ached tor them or remembered long.
Stories of drownings come to newspapers every day. The editors and report
ers become hardened to them.
Vet—somehow —the drowning at White river Friday seems worthy of more
than the mere "news" space it would ordinarily get.
For the 12-year-old boy who was drowned gave up his life for the greatest
worthwhile thing in life—service, or attempted service, to a fellow man.
Some heroes die fighting for a cause or country—die gloriously, and are
buried with flowers and pomp.
Then there are other heroes who do not die that way at all.

BEER INITIATIVE ONLY
ONE TO GET ON BALLOT
Safely docked in the office of
Secretary of State Howell at
Oiympli Saturday Is the "beer
bill," the only one of seven
proposed initiative petitions
that got enough signatures to
survive.
The "beer bill" permits the man
ufacture of beer and its sale under
certain restrictions In the state.
Rills which larked sufficient sig
natures to permit their being filed
when time was called at 5 p. in.
Friday were the home rule. fish,
first aid, nonpartisan, politicians'
code, and the bill to repeal the
statewide prohibition law.
The "beer bill" will be the oulv
Initiative bill to be voted on at the
November election.
Referendum Bills
Nine other measures will be on
the ballot, however, as follows:
Hotel men's liquor hill, permitting
sale of liquor in hotels of certain

siaiiing of Initiative, two bills for
referendum and recall petitions at
leftistra..oll places, enlarging Se
attle port commission and n-itl
plcketing bill. These are referen
dum bills, with the exception of the
hotel liquor bill. This measure was
presented to the lenislatu e m In
itiative petition, but the lawmakers
failed to vote on it. Automatically,
therefore, It goes on the November
ballot.
