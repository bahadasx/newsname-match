PHOCIKIE,
Howe Rejects The
Proposal of Sam Piatt
The opponents of Sam Piatt for
the Republican nomination for U. S.
senator, have refused to accept the
Piatt proposition for a so-called
preferential vote for the office men
tioned. Under date of Coldfield, July 4th.
A. H, Howe, replies to Mr. Piatt in
the following:
"I am in receipt of your letter of
June 28th, and in reply I wish to say
that, contrary to the opinion impli
ed In your suggestion, I have full
confidence that the delegates pro
vided by law to be elected by the
people under the Australian ballot
system will honestly and in good
faith carry out the will of the peo
ple. I personally favor a simple, di
rect primary law. The adoption of
your suggestion would entail an un
necessary expense and great addi
tional labor upon both candidates
and election boards. I cannot see
why we, the candidates for one
particular office should further com
plicate the matter by asking for a
special rule which, if granted to us,
could not be denied to candidates
for any othe office, and which the
law does not recognize. The appli
cation to all contests of the rule you
suggest "would add complexity to
the law to the point of chaos, The
Republican voters of the state would
probably be quite interested to as
certain why you seem to hold the
opinion that your candidacy " will
not receive fair consideration at
the hands of the delegates who are
themselves directly elected by the
people. I realize the necessity of
following the nominating procedure
laid down in the existing law, and,
therefore, cannot adopt your suggestion."

GAMBLING PETITIONS
NOT LIBERALLY SIGNED
The petition to submit the gamb
ling law as it was amended to read
at the last session of the legislature,
which started sometime ago at Love
lock does not seem to have met with
the success its promoters expected
A section of the petition was filed
yeseterday in the office of the Secre
tary of State, and contained but 40
names. It also lacked the necessary
affidavit to make it a legal document
but the defect is to be remedied. As
the petition to be effective must be
filed at least four months before the
election, the 6th instant is the last
day on which to file the remainder of
the signatures to make up ten per
cent of the total vote cast at the last
election. Carson News.
Attorney General's
Primary Section Advice
Questions of election law are bob-
blng up pretty regularly in the office
of the attorney general, and Mr,
Thatcher Is. handing out advice and
opinions as they appear. The fol
lowing letter has been addressed to
the several boards of county commis
sioners: i
July 3rd, 1916.
To the Hon. Board of County Com
It has been ealled to my atten
tion that in some of the counties,
the board of county commissioners
are creating new precincts and mak
ing further subdivisions or changes
In the boundaries and character of
old voting precincts, to be effective
before the primary election.
The creating of new precincts at
tills time, and particularly the change
In the boundaries and character of
old precincts will undoubtedly cause
a great amount of confusion in the
carrying out of the primary election.
An examination of the law will dis
close that apportionments of dele
gates to the state convention from
the respective counties and the ap
portionment of delegates from the
various precincts of the county to the
county conventions is based upon the
vote cast at the last general eUctTou
for representative in congress
Changes in the precincts by subdivid
ing them; any other changes as a
matter of fact will make It impossi
ble to carry out this apportionment.
Furthermore, you will observe that
it is the duty of state and county
central committee to file a certifi
cate of apportionment, showing the
representatives of the various coun
ties to the state convention ahd the
various precincts to the county con
vention before the 2nd Monday in
July, this year, July 10th. It Is ex
tremely doubtful whether for the
purpose of the primary, old precincts
may be sub-divided or new precincts
created. At any rate, it would seem
to me to be unwise to do so. ,
; I would respectfully suggest that
you take the matter up with your
district attorney and provide thai no
change in precincts be made or new
precincts created until after the pri
mary, owing to the confusion that
will undoubtedly be created thereby
and the doubtful legality of such proceeding.
Fourth Passed OIF
Pleasantly
In
Pioche
The Fourth of July celebration In
Pioche proved to be successful in
every -way. The program went off
without a hitch and nothing happen
ed to mar the pleasures of the day.
About day-break the usual salut
es were fired and shoitly after the
Pioche band boys appeared on the
street to dispense national airs.
The exercises at Thompson's hall
began promptly at 10:30 o'clock an)
lasted for fully an hour. The pro
grain was opened with prayer by
Judge J. M. Breeze, who was fol
lowed by a national sons by the
choir. A. L. Scott read the declara
tlon of Independence, after whicL
District Attorney Orr delivered an
oration appropriate for the occasion.
Following the exercises at the hall
everybody in town made their way to
the court house, where the refresh
ment committee had prepared the
feast of barbecued beef and other
things to satisfy the appetites of all.
The meat served was brought from
Eagle valley by Sam Hollinger and
Joe Hammond had charge of the
the barbecue and they proved them
selves to be past masters in the art
of roasting meat.
The children's sports were pul
ed off on Lacour street in the after
noon, after which the crowd moved
to Fuller Park to see the ball game
between the Prince and Pioche nines.
The miners from over the hill 'lost
to the town boya in a seven inuing
game, in a score of 11 to 2.
Crowds came from the Prince. At

day than there had been on any one

IjOUK Drouth Is Broken
The announcement card of Hon.
Sam Piatt, who at the last election
gave Senator Newlands the closest
run for his seat in the United States
senate that he had ever had in his
long years in that office, appears in
this issue of the Record.
Mr. Piatt is a lawyer of the high
est standing, and besides serving the
people of his native state, Nevada, in
many official capacities, for a number
of years was United States district at
torney. He is well known in every
village and hamlet in the state and
comes before the people in the same
straightforward manner that marked
his fight two years ago for a seat in
the highest deliberative body In the
union. He needs no introduction,
nor any flattering remarks said about
htm, to the people of Nevada.
Sam Piatt made the race for U. S
senator two years ago against great
odds, and came within 41 votes of
wresting the toga from Senator New
lands, whose residence in Nevada has
been somewhat of a minus quanti
ty for many years.
"Many Republicans look upon Piatt
as being the logical candidate this
year; that the stralghforward fight
waged two years ago entitles him to
another chance. He is opposed for
the nomination by Judge Norcross,
chief justice of the supreme court of
Nevada, and A. H. Howe, the Gold-
field mining man and banker. ,
The hot dry spell was broken yes
terday afternoon by a. refreshing rain
storm, which was most welcome, as
there has been no precipitation in
this vicinity since early .in April
A. rain storm has been needed for

In this issue of the Record is the
official announcement of R. R. Orr,
for the Republican nomination for
the office of sheriff of Lincoln coun
ty.
Roy needs no introduction; for he
is known by practically everyone in

if he knows Roy Orr, it is ten chanc
es to one that he will answer. "Sure,
he am the man what sells Ford cars."
Mr. Orr is Interested with T. K.
Lynch In the conduct of the City Gar
age. Previous to entering business
for himself, he was engaged about
the mines, usually in the capacity
of engineer.
Roy is qualified In evey way to fill
the duties of the office to which he
aspires and should he be successful
in landing the nomination, and be
ing elected in November, It is cer
tain that the the sheriff's office will
be in safe, reliable hands.

ty, Utah, but came to Lincoln coun
ty with his parents when but a small
boy. He is a brother of District At

Mine reports received by the U.
S. Geological survey from V.C.Heik-
es ef the Salt Lake field office indi
cates that durjng the last six months'
the mining Industry of Nevada has '
experienced one of Its greatest re
vivals. Old mines closed down for
years have resumed or are being put
in shape for production, and the
regular producers have increased
their output to the fullest capacity.
At many points the use of tractor
engines, hauling on each trip as
much as 30 tons of ore between mine
and railroad have helped to improve
conditions, as formerly there were
not teams enough for all purposes.
The many milling plants ot the state
are reported to be in full operation,
and a number have adopted the flota
tion process for increased saving.
In the Yellow Pine district lve dry
mills are operated on sine ores. Only
one of the two copper smelters la
Nevada was in operation. Gold -.vill
likely show little increase. The de
clining production at Goldfield may
be made up to some extent from the
general increase in the output of
ores. No new gold deposits of note
have been found. The placer-goll
production at Manhattan and Round
Mountain is about the same; the
latter making up for any decrease in
the former. Silver may show a gain
from increased operations made at
Rochester, but the Increase will pro-.
bably be offset by the Idleness 'of the
mines in Churchill County. Little if
any of the silver output Is held in
storage for higher prices compared
to the quanity held in 19L5.
The production of ore containing
lead has been greater than in recent
years, principally from Pioche and
Goodsprings, and Eureka. Ely pro
duces most of the copper, and at
the rate of production for the last
6 months will yield 92,000,000
pounds of the metal in 1916. Cop
per properties in the vicinity of Lun-
ing and Yerington have been active
in shipping low grade copper ores
to the Salt Lake smelters at the rate
of about 2,000 tons monthly. De
posits of zinc have been opened in
Elko County, where about 600 tons
la being shipped every month. In
Clark County around Goodsprings,
about 2,800 tons of oxidized zinc ore
was shipped in Mar and as much
during the previous months. At Pi
oche a small output of zinc sulphid
es was recorded.
