MINISTRATION HAS
DEATH BLOW WAITING
FOR CITY ICE PLANT
Expense of Several Thous
ands of Dollars in Prelimi
naries Promises Now to
vGo For Naught Latest
Bids Rejected Because
They're "Too High."
Latest Move in , Game to De-
lay , That Has Character
ized the Plan From Its In
V ception Confirms Suspic
ions That Administration
is Playing Double Game.'.
i- t - ; ' .
' Suspicion that 'the proposed munl-
eipal ice plant will not be built under
the auspices or the present administra
tion was confirmed today. : Another
move in the game, of delay that has
been going since the commission was
created is the decision, of the com
. mission to reject all bids as "'too
costly." The commission arrived at
this decision at a recent meeting. .
It Is . known that two of. the com
t missioners have beeen opposed to the
municipal ice plant from the start, tak
ing the ground that it could not be
conducted successfully ' or meet ex
penses. ' '
When bids were opened by the com
missioners two weeks ago it was found
ythat Dowling, &- Bottom-ley ;of this city
'were lowest bidders! for the construc
tion of the plant and the Vilter Mfg.
'C. of Milwaukee, Wis., were low in
the equipment. The bids provided that
' contracts be placed at once because of
the fluctuation in price of building ma
' terlals and metals. - " . -' . v '
The members or tne municipal ice
plant commission have .decided, how-
' ever, that these bias are too nigneua
they wlil reject all bids. Since the
' plant cannot be constructed in time
re servfce this summer other bids will
not be' asked right away, and. In fact,
1 It is doubtful If bids will be asked for
at alL : - V ",
It is said that strong political pres
" sure .brought Upon members of the
Ice plant commission has Induced them
to take this step and that they will
.shortly report. to the. common council
that in their Judgment a municipal ice
' plant cannot be constructed and malrr-
- s tained successfully and .they will rec-
- toitimend "that thr plan be ajb&udoned:

planned by the Molders' union. No.
110, of this city, to strengthen their
organization as a means to obtaining
better wages,-and Improved' working
conditions. - The molders, , especially
the International officers, believe that
in the matter of working conditions,
their craft is not faring as' well in
Bridgeport as other crafts, and they
say this' is due in large part the
lack of unionization of all workers, of
the trade.
It is expected that there will be
at least 200 molders at the meeting
Monday ' night. James - Muldoon,
president of local No. -110, will pre

The capture of tho village of Hem,
was accomplished by the French onljfc;
after three desperate attempts. The .'
first two onslaughts, although deliv-j
ered with great force and determina
tion, were repulsed.
The' fighting at Estrees and Belloy-
En-Santerre also was of a house to
house and hand-to-hand character. ..
The wave of battle swept back" and

ing with the utmost desperation. The ;
losses, as to be expected, in this sort j '
of fighting, were very heavy. The
French finally remained master of" '
the Belloy. ,

British to extejtd the front offensive!
er for a renewed attack at new places .
on the long front hut as yet no serl-'
ous endeavor in 'this direction har
been reported. , 1
