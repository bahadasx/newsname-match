London. Jnly S. fnoonL With the
aid of innumerable guns and waves of
infantry the British army continues to
make slow progress in its effort to
bring the front line between the
Ancre and Montauban on a level with
the FYench line further south, the
French having pushed further ahead
than their allies. This effort has led
to the most furious fighting in which
the British troops have been engaged.
The flower of the German army has
been brought forward to oppose them.
According to reports from Holland,
Belgium has been denuded of German
soldiers to meet the Anglo-French of
fensive. In London the reports of the British
commander. General Sir Douglas Haig.

arrival of wounded tells the price
which is being paid for the advance,
the news of the small gains is being
received with quiet satisfaction.

on German reserves for the battle in
Picardy, the German crown prince has
resumed the offensive at Verdun and

region of Baranovichi. In Galieia and
Volhynia, however, the Teutons admit
the withdrawal of their line. Accord

lines of retreat across the Carpathians,

JOIN FRENCH AN DO
AMERICAN TRADE
Bepresentative Announces Flan of
Foreign Society for Promoting Busi
ness Between Countries.
New York, July 8. Before sailing
for Bordeau today on board the steam
er Rochambeau, Dr. Arnad Rosenthal,
American representative of the French
society for commercial development,
announced plans for promoting trade
between America and France. During
his five months' stay in this country,
Dr. Rosenthal attended every trade
congress or meeting of manufacturers
and meiiLaatsiJajery fjite..he had.
Tfeen able" to reach and made arrange
ments with leading manufacturers and
merchants to handle their goods in
France through the society which he
represented.
This organization, he declared, has
a financial backing of more than $100,
000,000. Its principal object is to
eliminate all middlemen and brokers
so that buyers on both sides may deal
directly with producers. Dr. Rosen
thal said the bank which is backing
the French society will pay cash for
goods in America if necessary and will
carry the merchant in France until he
makes payment. The society also will
guarantee to the French merchant
that the gods he buys are as repre
sented. This method, said Dr. Rosenthal,
will eliminate at least two commis
sions. In many cases where France
bought goods during the war the pur
chasers have had to pay seven com
missions, he said.
The plans of the society call for "a
trade bourse" devoted to United States
commerce in France where goods can
be placed by American firms for sale.

BANK HELD LIABLE
IN LORIMER DEAL
Circuit Court Judge Smith Renders
Decision Against Central Trust
Company for $1,250,000.
Chicago, July 8. A decision making
the Central Trust company of Illinois,
a Chicago bank, liable for $1,250,000,
with interest from Oct. 21, 1912, in con
nection with the failure of the La
Salle Street Trust and Savings bank,
was handed down today by Judge
Frederick A. Smith in the circuit court.
On the date mentioned, the La Street
institution changed from a national to
a state bank. According to testimony
William Lorimer, its president, to
comply with a law requiring that the
capital and surplus of a state bank
must be paid in cash, then asked
Charles G. Dawes, president of the
Central Trust, to cash a check for
$1,250,000.
This, according to the testimony,
Mr. Dawes agreed to do and the Cen
tral Trust cashed the check, drawn on
the La Salle Street National bank. The
money was given to Mr. Lorimer and
he turned it over to the state bank
examiner, who gave it back to Mr. Lor
imer with a certificate of the bank's
incorporation as a state bank. Mr. Lor
imer then returned the money to the
Central Trust and received his check,
and the La Salle Trust and Savings
bank was organized.
This transaction. Judge Smith held
illegal and on it held the Central Trust
company liable. The suit against the
Central Trust was brought by William
C. Niblack, receiver for the Lorimer
bank.

Await Plans
of Carranza
to End Case
Washington, July 8. Word of Gen
eral Carranza's decision as to the
form diplomatic negotiations for the
settlement of bordef difficulties should
take was expected today at the state
department.
It is thought probable the de facto
government will authorize Eliseo Ar
redondo, ambassador-designate here
to talk matters over informally with
Acting Secretary Polk. The general
form of an agreement could be framed
in this way and later formally rati
fied. Officials anticipate that the Car
ranza government will again offer the
border cantonment plant irst present-
i ed at the El Paso conference between
Major General Scott and the Mexican
war minister, General Obregon. It was
rejected then because immediate with
drawal of General Pershing's men
from Mexico was stipulated by Obre
gon as a condition. If it is renewed
without that stipulation, it may prove
acceptable.

IRWIN AND BRIDE
ATTEMPT SUICIDE
ewly Married Couple Slash Wrists
at 3!aratawa Beach When Draft
Is 1'nhonored.
Chicago, July 8. A crimson stain
which appeared on the first floor caaf
ing of the Hotel Macatawa at Maca
tawa beach, near Holland, Mich.,' yes
terday ledjto the discovery of the at
tempteS " doubT5sTTTcTde cf Joseph Ir
win of Chicago and his bride of two
weeks. They had slashed their wrists
with safety razor blades.
Irwin, who has lived at the Hotel
Warner for a number of years, is a
son of Judge W. T. Irwin of the law
firm of Jack, Irwin & Jack in Peoria
and a nephew of Mayor E. M. Wood
ruff of that city. He probably will re
cover. Mrs. Mabel Irwin, who formerly was
a trained nurse, is a sister of Miss
Helen Orman of Oakland place and
Grand boulevard. Her condition is
said to be critical.
Irwin calmly told of their attempts
at suicide and attributed their action
to despondency over the refusal of his
faher's firm to honor a draft which he
had tendered in payment of his board
bill at the hotel.
"Joe" Irwin is a familiar figure in
Chicago's night life. He is known as
a heavy spender and hard drinker.
Three years ago he went to Dwight,
111., to take the liquor cure, but soon
went back to his old ways upon his
return to Chicago.
He worked at odd times, sometimes
dabbling in real estate, sometimes
working for coal companies, often
acting as agent for vrious automo
bile concerns. He Is said to have an
income of about $200 a month from
stock in the Woodruff Ice company in
Peoria.
Worry over her husband's habits is
said to have hastened the death of his
first wife, who died about seven
months ago, leaving a three-year-old
son, William. His first wife came
from an old, distinguished Peoria fam
ily. Mrs. Josephine Booth Parsons,
her mother, was buried in Rosehill
cemetery on Thursday. Grief over her
(laughter's death and her son-in-law's
actions is said to have caused her last
illness.
About three weeks ago Miss Mabel
Orman went to the Hotel Warner to
rest. There she met Irwin. A trip
across the lake followed. Later they
returned to Michigan and were mar
ried two weeks ago, four days after
their first meJing. Irwin told the
management of the hotel at which they
were stopping that he was agent for
an automobile concern in Holland.
A few days ago he found himself
owing a bill of $92. He drew a draft,
on his father's firm for $107. The draft
was not honored.
Yesterday hotel employes noticed a
red stain Keeping through the ceiling
on the first floor. They ran to the
room ahov and found Irwin and his
wife unconscious on the bed. Mayor
WoodrutI of Peoria was first notified
of the attempted suicide.
"1 had lost track of Joe." he said.
"The last I heard of him he was in
Idaho attempting to promote some
railway proposition. He returned here
once since then. I had heard he was
married but have never met his wife."
As soon as he was notified the father
sent N. C. Seidenberg, a junior mem
ber of the firm, to Holland.
Miss Helen Orman denied that she
ever had seen Irwin.
"My sister was in the best of health
when she left," said Miss Orman, "and
she never had any worries that I
knew of."

infantrymen had overtaken the
bandits at Las lTas, south of
Jiminez, about 2 o'clock this mom
Jnjr. General Arrieta wired Gen

Eonrteen Mexicans are reported
to hare been killed In a battle with
three Americans not far from
Anapra, . M according- to a re
port received here today.
The .Mexicans are reported to
have crossed the border at 2 a, m
and rustled IB head of horses from
the ranch of Tv Perrine, three
miles out of Anapra.
Perrine, a Texas ranger and a
former customs guard, waited un.
til daylight, when with two of his
juon he set out in pursuit.
At noon Unlay he telephoned
Into EI Paso that he and his men
had canght up with the Mexicans

San Antonio, Texas, July R For
more than 2(H) miles eastward
from El Paso American troops
were being held in readiness toduy
to move to any point on the bor
der that might be threatened by
the newly organized bandits in
Chihuahua.
Early morning reports to Gen
eral Eunston added nothing, how
ever, to the warning of yesterday
from the do facto government that
bandits who defeated Carranza
soldiers near Jiminez were be
lie vim! to be moving northward to
ward Ojinaga, opposite Presidio,
Texas.
Colonel Gaston, commanding the
American forces in the nig Bend dis
trict, was authorized by General Fun
ston to make such disposition of his
troops as he deemed wise to prevent
Mexican bandits crossing the river.
Army officers today were not in
clined to believe the bandits would
attempt any movement in force to
ward the north, especially if led by
Villa, who they believe would confine
his activities for a time in harrow
ing the Carranza troops.
Villa in Gang!
Washington, July S. Further report
on the tight in which bandits over
whelmed a Carranza force near Cor
ralitos, southern Chihuahua, was
looked for today by Kliseo Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador-designate, and the
state department, to which he prom
ised to communicate the information.
Of greatest interest to officials was
the question of whether the outlaw
band included Francisco Villa and
whether he is bound for the American
border to make another raid.
War department officials pointed oul
that the distance from Cocralitos in
the nearest border point, the Big Ben l
district of Texas, is 1R5 miles and the
routo is over a desert. Preparations
will bo made to guard against any
possible attack, however.
The state department had a report
from an American who said he talked
to Villa at Corralitos a few days be
fore the fight with the Carranzlstas.
A statement by the war department
press bureau today said more unsup
ported rumors had been received of
the presence of Villa at Canutillo on
the Uio Florida, wt of Parral. Th
reports said Villa's wounds were
caused by a bullet that passed through
the back tnusclos of both sides without
striking a bone and he has recovered
sufficiently to 'walk with a limp and
ride with greater ease.
