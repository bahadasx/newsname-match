ALL -DAY CONFERENCE.
Union Agrees Manufacturers
Have Right to Increase or
Decrease Force.
Tho Kvennlg World is In a position
to announce that the garment work
ers lock-out of fully 60,000 men and
women which has continued for ten
weeks, probably will be settled with
in twenty-four hours.
An all day executive sosslon Is be
ing held by tho Manufacturers' As
sociation to decide the main Issue of
tho strike.
From nil Indications nnd expres
slons of members It will follow tho
lines suggested to both the union and
tho association by The Hvenlng
World yesterday. This to give to the
workers cither the right to strike or
to establish ft Hoard of ellvlew or
Arbitration to settle all disputes .as
to discharge.
The manufacturers wltl accede tho
right to strike.
With this ono fundamental point
settled no wthe workers and strikers
will be ready for conference to de
cMe tho minor issues which It Is
generally agreed can readily be ad
justed after a conference Is once made
possible.
There Is hardly any likelihood that
this matter will go over until next
week, although It may not be otn
dally glvon out.
This was the question submitted to
tho union by un Kvenlng World rep
resentative:
"Will you concede the omployers'
right to regulate the number of em
ployecs In his factory to meet the re
quirements therefn and to retain such
employees as he may desire on the
basis of efficiency as unquestioned,
and that tho cxerclsn of the employ

"Will you concede, the cmployors'
right to discharge for luck of work
and to retain such employees ns ho
may desire on the basis of elllclency,
nnd that discharge for this reason
shall not bo construed as oppressive
or unjust?"
To this Mr. Hchleslnger of the
Union replied through Tho Kvenlng
World representative:
"Trip Union haa never asked for the
closed shop, but has Insisted that em
ployers live up to tho proferenttal
clause which prescribes preference for
Union workers at thu time of hiring,
and which was practised for five
years.
"Tho Union has never denied to tin
employer tho right to discharge work
ers or to reorganlr.0 their factories in
accordance with the efficiency of their
business, All tho Union asks Is that
the iniinufnctiirers do not exercise
i that right oppressively or unjustly

ployecs that Ino complaint liu nt.
