Abolishing Tacoma's Public Phones!
In Which the
Editor
the Lawyers
BY THE EDITOR.
A lawyer Mend takes me gently to task for pre
suming to criticise a decision 01 the ittpmne court.
While the decision in question—ordering the two
initiative bills rewritten—he admits, looked rather
fishy on the face of it, a layman ought not to find
fault, ''because laymen do not understand law."
Bless your heart, of course the laymen do not
understand law. They can understand history,
science, sociology, even philosophy and theology to a
degree, but nobody except a lawyer can understand
law.
And the funny part of it is, very few lawyers
understand law. In every suit they divide into two
nearly equal sections, each section contending that it
lias tiie only legitimate, true and Indisputable argu
ment — and the two arguments always are flatly con
tradictory!
Then a third lawyer, whom we call a judge, de
cides that one side is right and the other Wrong, or
that one side is partially righi and the other side
Wrong, or that both sides are wrong' and that what lie
says is the only accurate version of that law.
Whereupon one of the completely mistaken sides
appeals the ease to another court presided over by
nine more lawyers.
They mull it over a long while, and finally hand
down a decision which may declare that the other
infallible judge's opinion was all wrong, and even
that all the lawyers in the case were all wrong.
Quite often just five of the nine take itart in this
final act of infallibility. The other four may split
four ways, making fixe separate and distinct opinions
from one court of nine judges, just as our own Wash
ington supreme court did a short time ago in a libel
ease.
No, the laymen cannot understand the law; that
is evident. BUT WHAT IS LAW ANYWAY?

He could no longer have a phone for the convenience of hl»

time he wanted to talk, he must hide it behind a fence or in a booth.
Muehlenbruch had no hUli board fence in his place.

Several Broadway merchants have been moving Into new quar
ters recently.
There's Day, the Jeweler. For 19 years In his old store he en
joyed the use of a phone. A few days ago he moved Into the new
building at 1139 Broadway.
The phone company slapped the rule on him.
Day suggested they put his phone In a cellar. It ended up in
a back room behind a brick wall.
Day's office is out in the front of his store. Kvery time the
bell rings he has to ieave his desk and make a trip to the back room,
trusting to luck that the jewelry will be there when he gets back.
Feist & llachrach were in better luck. In the back of their new
store is a gallery for the offices. A patron would have to climb the
stairs to get there. The phone was allowed to rest In a corner be
hind the gallery railing.

Manager Bchlarb claims phones which are open to tbo public
cost too much money to the eomimny and that this expense has to
come out of the pockets of other subscribers. He says the company
Intends eventually to cut out all flat rate phones used by the ptibiio
In stores and force the iim- of pay ptiones in their places.
"Seven calls a day is the business on the average phone," tie
said. "A check of some of the downtown store phones has shown,
more than 300 calls a day on one phone. It stiudß to reason that
other subscribers must pay for this extra service."
