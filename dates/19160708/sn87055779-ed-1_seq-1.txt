Villa's return to the border at
the leacl of a new horde of wild
riders was awaited all along the in
ternational boundary line today.
Citizens and soldiers were ready to
give him an appropriate reception.
At the same time it was reported
that Hen. Pershing's punitive expe
dition, which was formed for the
purpose of getting Villa, "dead or
alive." would resume its o.uest. With
Villa located, his trail again septus
to he "hot." and Pershing is sup
posed to have requested that the
administration allow him to revise
the withdrawal movement and re
new the hunt.
Carranza's attitude toward the
punitive expedition probably will
undergo a change with Villa prow
ing stronger every hour. While
Villa lives, the de facto government
cannot consider itself in control of
any fituation, notaWy the one cre
ated by bandits.
Army May lsrl.
In addition to this. Cairanza is
once more faced with desertion of
an army that seems to prefer ade
quate pay to service in pure faith.
The complaint of the army against
the "two-cent" peso was stilled with
the prospect of ar with the Bnited
States. But it has broken nut in a
fresh roar and there are reports
that the federal soldados are look
ing forward to the coming of Villa
that they may join him.
After Villa's force killed Hen.
Bamos and whipped the Carranzista
force at Barral and again at .lim

American border warned to keep a
lookout for the return of Pancho.
Then Car ran 'a notified Washington
