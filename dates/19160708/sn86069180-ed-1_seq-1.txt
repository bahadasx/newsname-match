WORKED ONLY FOR IRELAND
Viscount Reading, Lord Chief
Justice of England, with the black
cloth by tradition called a cap
spread over his head, and his two
associates in scarlet gowns, like
wise black-capped, pronounced the
sentence of death for high treason
on Sir Roger Casement half an hour
after the foreman of the jury, in a
shaking voice, gave the verdict of
guilty. Sir Roger addressed the
court, reading the final statement
with the explanation that he wished
It might reach a much larger audi
ence than the ono before him, and
particularly the people of America,
from whom had come many mes
sages of sympathy to him and whoso
own struggle for liberty, he said,
always had been an inspiration to
Irishmen. Sir Roger's auditors,
among whom were Viscount Bryco
and many other prominent men and
women, listened in deepest silence,
some moved to tears. The prisoner
declared ho did not regard the trial
by Englishmen in an English court
as a trial by his peers, to which
he was entitled. He reviewed re
cent events in Ireland from tho be
ginning of tho formation of the
Ulster Volunteers, and said:
"Wo have seen the constitutional
army refuse to obey the constitu
tional government and wo were told
the first duty of Irishmen was to
enter that army. If small nations
were to be the first consideration
I saw no reason why Ireland should
shed any blood for any people but
her own. If that be treason I am
not ashamed to avow it here. If
the Unionists chose the road they
thought would lead to tho good side,
I knew my road led to the dark
slde.Bothhpfe,usprpved-1rlght. . So
I am "prouder to stand here, in a
traitor's dock, than to fill tho place
of my accusers. Solf-government is
our right. It is no more a thing to
be withheld from us or doled out to
us than the right to life or light,
to sunshine or spring flowers."
Throwing aside his manuscript,
lr Roger said: "My Lords, I have
done. Gentlemen of tho jury, I
wish to thank you for your verdict,
I meant no reflection upon you
when I said this was not a trial by
my peers."
Tho verdict was not a surprise.
His counsel will take an Immediate
anDeal to tho Criminal Court of
Appeals, and then to tho House of
Lords, if necessary, because they
feel that the point or law involving
a statute BOO years old, under which
Sir Roger was tried, never has been
legally tested. There were numerous
striking sentences in Sir Roger's
speech.
"There is an objection, possibly
not good in law, but surely good on
moral grounds," ho said, "against
the application to me here of this
old English statute, 565 years old,
that seks to deprive an Irishman to
day of his life and his honor, not
for adhering to the King's enemies,
but for adhering to his own people.
When this statute was passed in
1351, what was the state of men's
minds on the question of a far
higher allegiance, that of man to
God and his kingdom? Tho law of
that day did not permit him to for
sake his church or deny his God
save with his life. The heretic then
had tho same doom ns tho traitor.
Today a man may forswear God and
his heavenly realm without fear or
penalty, all earlier statutes having
gone tho way of Nero's edicts
against the Christians; but that
constitutional phantom, tho King,
can still dig up from the dungeon
and torture chambers of tho dark
ages a law that takes a man's life
and limb for an exercise of his con
science. If true religion rests on
love, it is equally true that loyalty
rests on love. The law I am charged
under has no parentage in love, and
claims that allegiance of today on
the ignorance and blindness of the
past. I am being tried, in truth,
not by my peers of the living pres
ent, but by tho fears of tho dead
past; not by the civilization of the
twentieth century, but by the
brutality of tho fourteenth; not
even by a statute framed in tho
language of the land that tries me,
but omitted in the; language of an
enemy land, so antiquated Is the
law that must be sought today to
slay an Irishman whoso offense Is
that he puts Ireland first. Loyalty
is a sentiment, not a law. It rests
on love, not on restraint. The
government of Ireland by England
rests on restraint, not on law, and
since it demands no love it can
evoke no loyalty.
"This court, this jury, the public
opinion of this country can not but
be prejudiced la varying degrees
against me, most of all in time of
war. I did not land in England; I
landed in Ireland. Jt was to Ireland
I came, to Ireland I wanted to
come, and the last place I desired
to land was England. But for the
Attorney General of England there
Is no Ireland; there la only Eng
land; there is no Ireland", only the
law of , England; no right of Ire
land. Yet for me, the Irish out
law, there la a land of Ireland, a
right of -Ireland, a charter for all
Irishmen to appeal to In the last
resort, a charter that even the very
statutes of England can not deprive
ine of, a charter that Englishmen
themselves nssert ns a fundamental
bond pt law that connects the two
kingdoms."
Referring to the phrase of tho In
dictment that he set an evil ex
ample to others, Sir Roger said:
"To Englishmen I set no evil ex
ample, for I made no appeal to
them. I asked Irishmen to fight
for their rights. Place mo before a
Jury of my own countrymen, be it
Protestant or Catholic, Unionist or
Nationalist, Sinn Fein or Orange,
and I shall accept tho verdict and
bow to the statute and all its pen
alties. It is not I who am afraid
of tho verdict of such a jury; it is
the Crown. If this bo not so, why
fear tho test; I fear it not; I de
mand it ns my right. It was not I
who landed in England, but the
Crown that dragged mo here, away
from my own country, to which I
had returned with a price upon my
head, away from my own country
men, whose loyalty is not in doubt,
and safe from tho judgment of my
peerp, whoso Judgment I do not
shrink from. That is the condemna
tion of English rule In Ireland, of
English made law, that it daro not
rest on the will of the Irish people,
but exists in defiance of their will;
that It is a rule derived, not from
right, but from conquest. Conquest
gives no title; it can exert no em
pire dver man's reason and judg
ment and affections. It is from this
law of conquest, without title to
the reason, judgment and affections
of my own countrymen, that I ap
peal." Having finished this state
ment, the prisoner said: "This much
I penned in my prison fifteen days
ago."
Ho then continued, declaring that
tho Nationalist volunteers founded
in Dublin in November, 1913, had
no quarrel with tho Ulster volun
ters born a year earlier, only with,
the men who sought "to pervert to
English party use, to the mean pur
poses of their own bid for place
and power tho armed activities of
the simple Irishmen. We aimed at
winning tho Ulster volunteers," he
went on, "to tho cause of a United
Ireland. It was not tho Irish volun
ters who broko tho law, but a Brit
ish party government, who had per
mitted tho Ulster volunteers to bo
arnied by Englishmen, to threaten
not only an English party in its
hold on office but to threaten that
party through tho lives and blood
of Irishmen. Tho battle was to be
fought In Ireland, that tho political
outs of today should bo tho ins of
tomorrow. In Great Britain a law
designed for tho benefit of Ireland
was to be met, not on tho floor of
Parliament, where the fight had
been won, but on the fleldi with
Irishmen slaying each other for
English party gain. And the British
navy would'bechartored'htraBsports
bringing to our shores a numerous
assemblage of military and ex
mllltary experts In the congenial
and profitable business of holding
down subject populations abroad.
That party was preaching a doctrine
of hatred, designed to bring civil
war in Ireland, while the party in
power took no steps to restrain Its
propaganda, which was finding ad
vocates in the army, tho navy, the
Privy Council, In Parliament and
State and Church."

CARDINAL MAKES APPEAL.
Cardinal Farley,. In a letter to
tho pastors in tho archdiocese of
New York, ordered that a collection
for tho Irish Relief Fund be taken
up at every service next Sunday.
His letter read in part;
"The punishment which England
meted out so mercilessly by execu
tion, Imprisonment or deportation
to hundreds, if not thousands, of
fathers, husbands and sons, has
fallen with extreme severity and
diro misery on countless women and
children. Christian charity Imposes
on us all, irrespective of raco, but
especially on those of Irish blood,
tho urgent duty of extending timely
and substantial relief to tho Inno
cent victims of Ireland's latest af
fliction. Please read this, appeal
and add such words as your zeal
and prudonco dictate. It Is hardly
necessary to suggest that any refer,
ence, on this occasion, to the Irish
question from a political viewpoint,
would be unseemly and unwjse."

and low, but the passage of years
has dissipated them. If it ceased
to exist today it would have to be
recreated tdmorrow from the samo
sources and for the samo purposes.
But Federation is looking forward.
A great convention is ahead of It.
What will Its messago be? What
will It accomplish?
Federation is a conglomerate of
various nationalities. .One of the
prime objects wa3 to create and
foster fraternity among tho Ameri
can Catholics of variant national
extraction. Progress has been
made, and there will bo no let-up in
flio endeavor to secure a higher
unity of nation-wide Catholic action,
not by amalgamation of constituent
elements, but by co-ordination. This
is true not only of organizations,
but also of their various works.
Autonomy in federations means as
much to Federationists as the doc
trine of State rights in tho Federal
Union.
Federation has entered many
fields; national and international
problems havo come within its
scope. It has vindicated the Cath
olic educational system and at the
same time protected the public
school system against some of
its "guardians." It has made its
policies heard and respected in
many a legislature of the land,
without political contamination; it
has voiced Catholic thought on
many phases of charitable and so
cial work; lent Its Influence to tho
struggling tollers of the land; with
a heavy hand It has smitten tho
agents of immorality, and the press
of the country has re-echoed tlmo
and again the convictions and feel
ings of the mass of Catholic men
and women who constitute so great
a part of the American common
wealth. A convention Is a home-coming of
armies in the field. Tho exploits
of various contingents are re
hearsed; new measures are devised;
greater campaigns planned. Men
are beginning to feel that there is
a great philosophy in federation and
they see emerging from the con
glomerate state one organic union,
paving the way to Christian democ
racy in America.
Responsibility comes with growth
and prestige; the future will de
mand greater service than the past;
results must be achieved com
mensurate with tho proximate and
ultimate ideals of tho Catholic Fed
eration. Tho problem of training
federation staffs, secretaries, or
ganizers, lecturers, correspondents,
field workers, will loom up larger
than over before. Eventually fed
eration will havo complete system,
method, direction, and the striking
efficiency of a well-knit lay organi
zation throwing into the secular
arena the wonderful poVer and re
sources of the Catholic religion. It
will mean much for America in the
plan of Divine redemption.

SHOULD NOT THROW THEM ASIDE
The radical forces in this country
havo one redeeming feature they
never know when their propaganda
has fulfilled its purpose. They keep
hammering eternally at tho Ideas
which they believe will cure the Ills
of the world. Set-back and defeat
affect them but little; they Just con
tinue crying out tho more. Of
course there aro a number whr
weaken and fall by the wayside,
but the ardor of the remainder
seems but slightly diminished there
by. Their woik of converting the
unbelievers goes on unabated.
In the New York Call of June
25, on tho second page, there ap
pears an ad whose headlines run as
follows: "The present tax system is
the cause of idle land, idlo men,
low wages, high rents and lack of
business. Tho single tax is the
cure. Our public product, the value
of the land, which is caused by
population, shall bo takon by taxa
tion for our public needs (police
men, firemen, school teachers, etc..
etc.), leaving your private product
(salary or wages) for your pilvate
needs (food, clothing, shelter, etc.,
etc.)"
"Single Tax Is tho Cure," thus
runs the story; and the Manhattan
Single Tax Club has paid for Us in
sertion. "Read Progress and Pov
erty, by Henry George." it advises
at the conclusion of Its advertise
ment. Now it may bo well to know
that five million copies of this book
havo already been glvon to the
world (so wo are Informed by a
very recent history of the "Single
Tax Movement in the United
States," written by Arthur Nichols
Young, 101G); desplto this wide
distribution single tax has prac
tically accomplished nothing for
itself In a legislative way; its prin
ciples have been refuted time and
again, notably in "The Fundamental
Fallacy of Socialism," by Arthur
Preuss. And yet these people con
tinue without abatement In their
propaganda.
Catholics and conservatives In
general ought to take a cuo from
this. Of course Prof. Carver has
pointed out that there aro disadvan
tages in this method of procedure
also. But there is a good lesson in
it "for us. We should not become
so easily discouraged In our
altruistic and social endeavors,
based as they aro on a correct
foundation. We should not throw
them aside so quickly, as wo are
prone to do. The radicals can teach
us something on this score.

DEMOCRATS'
Chances For Success liclng In
jured by Tactics of Dcm
cratic Press.
Antl-Gcrman-Amcrican Policy
Driving Substantial Support
Out of Party.
Campaign Chairman CantrilFs
Appeal Indicates Close Race
in Kentucky.
SHERIFF CRONAN FOR MAYOR
Attention was called in theso
columns recently to the fact that the
policy pursued by some of our
Democratic papers was injurious to
tho success of the Democratic party
and that the daily insults by ed
itorial and cartoon was serving to
drive the German-American voter
Into tho Republican camp. In his
opening statement on Thursday Con-
gressman J. C. Cantrill in reference
to this question said in part:
"The Republicans in Kentucky
are in high glee because they ex
pect the support of the voters of
Gorman extraction. This is an open
Insult to tho intelligence and pa
triotism of tho voters In Kentucky
of German descent. I know many
of these men and they are as pa
triotic as any class of our citizens,
and I certainly expect the support
of those who have been Democrats
heretofore and of those who lovo
the flag of the Stars and Stripes
better than any other flag. I cer
tainly would not Insult tho patriot
Ism of the voters of German descent
by even conceding that any propor
tion of them in Kentucky expected
to vote the Republican ticket this
fall."
Despite this appeal of Chairman
Cantrill the local pro-British press
continues to insult tho Gorman
American Democratic voter, the
Louisville Times publishing a car
ton with Hughes, Roosovelt and tho
Kaiser as bedfellows In tho samo
issue with the Campaign Chair
man's appeal to the German-American
voter. Tho last campaign in
this State was badly mismanaged
through the efforts of thoso in
charge bargaining with a lot of
self-appointed labor, pleaders .and
walklngidelegates,.okavejthji!!Hjc
vote delivered to StameyTtflo Ken-''
tucky.Irfsh Americas 'warning tho
campaign pjanlTgeis In advance that
th's wc a mistaken policy, as
there is no such commodity as a
labor vote, and least of all can It
bo delivered by tho walking dele
gates who aro always ready to pub
lish their indorsement of such a
candidate at so much per. Now a
warning word in this campaign. Tho
Knownothlng attltudo of some of
tho Democratic press will drive tho
German-American vote Into Bolld
support of tho Republican party.
That none can be spared is evi
denced by another statemont of
Chairman Cantrill as follows:
"I feel that it is my duty to lay
some plain facts before the Demo
crats of Kentucky. The votes as
actually cast for the last twenty
years show that Kentucky is a very
close State politically. At tho out
set I wish to warn my Democratic
brethren of overconfldence."
Tho Louisville Times and Cincin
nati Enquirer published tho fact
this past week that Sheriff Charley
Cronan was being mentioned for
Mayor, this being published in the
Kentucky Irish American over a
month ago with tho note appended
that in 1913 running for offico tho
first time he led the other first
starters for city and county offices.
Another Indication of Mr. Cronan's
political strength Is shown by com
parison with the vote of County
Attorney Scott Bullitt, whom tho
writer considers the strongest man
In Louisville. Sheriff TJronan re
ceived 25,191 votes in the city
proper against County Attorney
Bullitt's 25,227, only thirty-six votes
difference. Two other probablo
candidates are ex-Mayor Head, who
has a good following and Is a
splendid campaigner, and J. G. Cald
well, present Chairman of tho
Board of Works, whom it Is
rumored will be supported by his
close friend and backer, Gen. W. B.
Haldeman.
As wo go to press tho appoint
ment of a sucessor to succeed Will
Holloy as Police Court Clerk had
not been announced, tho names of
Thomas O'Connell, William Dennis,
Harry Nehan, Clay Hall and Harry
T. Colgan having been mentioned.
Tho appointment to bo mado by
Judge Boldrlck, of tho Police Court,
will only hold until tho November
election and naturally his selection
will have to be confirmed by the
City and County Democratic Com
mittee. IMPORTANT MEETING.
At tho meeting of the local Cath
olic Federation, to bo held In

Thursday ovening, delegates will be-
' eiectea to tne national convention
which is to be held in New York
