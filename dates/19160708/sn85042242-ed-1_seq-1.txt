SOME TWELVE HOURS
WITHOUT ANY FOOD
No Screens to Protect Hospital

(Special to The Tribune.)
Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, July 7.
—A day in sweltering woolen on cac
tus-Btrewn desert land!
A night without canvas above them
and with only blankets between their
soft bodies and the hard, rocky
ground!
Twelve hours without food under
the merciless sun!
Men falling in dead fa:nts, men ly­
ing sick in cots with no screens to
protect them from the flies!
This is only the most meager rec
ord of the appaling unpreparedness
of our newly federalized militia, as
exemplified on the day of their ar­
rival by three companies of the Mas
sachusetts national guard, and a por­
tion of New Jersey's contingent, the
first militiamen to encamp here on
the Texas border!
The experiences of these brave
boys from the cool states of the north,
face to face for the first time with
the hard facts of military life along
the heat-breathing sands of the Rio
Grande country, are the experiences
in general of all the other militia
that have reached the Mexican bor­
der.
In the opinion of the recognized au­
thorities on military marters not ev*u
the delays of days and weeks that
have characterized the mobilization
of the national guard tire so signifi­
cant as the glaring lack of training
and the no less obvious lack of equip
ment when these regiments are with­
in gun shot of Mexico.
Some Arrive Wearing Derby Hats.
Compared with the Mexican sol
r"ifier?

guardsmen who have arrived in El

fttatlnw«*a»5«t Ft. Bliss and in the city
of El Paso, these national guard boys,
whose fine patriotism does not take
second place to anybody, are lament­
ably lacking, it is glaringly obvious,
in certain things that military tradi­
tion and present necessity require,
and this despite tho appropriations
of millions by congress and state leg
islatures and the -warnings that the
United States war department Jong
ago gave the commanders of these 48
little, independent, uncoordinated
armies to bring their units up to war
requirements.
In matter of equipment some of the
militia forces here are days and
weeks from war requirements in the
matter of traifairig an'd effloiency they
are months distant.
Take, for instance, the Massachu­
setts national guard contingent, which
is rated, along with the Pennsylvania
and New York,militia, as. the best in
the country.
More than 50 of the 73 men of Am­
bulance Corps No. 1 when detrained
here to go into camp, fainted, more
from lack of food than from the hetft.
On the, train for more than four
days their meals had consisted large­
ly of tomatoes, -crackers and coffee.

.67 men and 5 officers, were using
their cots for the sick among them

skirts of El Paso, only 'a short dis­
tance from the Mexican border, with­

Soldier's Father Donates Guns.
The machine gun company of the
Eighth had several of their automatic
rifles out of commission. But for­
tunately for the men the father of
one of them, Henry Parkmasi, ga""j
the company to buy four Lew'.s
machine guns.
'No one questions Parkman's gen­
erous and patriotic motives, but it is
thought he wanted to give his son

men the best 'fighting chances for
their lives with a machine gun that
has demonstrated its superiority over
the kind now being used by the mili
tia and the regular army.
"If I had my way," said a sergeant

Washington, July 7.—Inception of
the diplomatic conversations, which it
is hoped will result in a settlement of
the differences between the United
States and the de facto government
of Mexico, awaited tonight a sugges­
tion from General Carranza as to how
they should proceed. State depart­
ment officials believed more can be ac­
complished through informal confer­
ences between Elisio Arerndondo,
Mexican ambassodar-designate, and
Frank L. Polk, acting secretary of
state, than by a formal exchange of
views.
They are willing to accede, how­
ever, to some other plan should the
de facto government suggest it.
Sends Friendly Note.
Mr. Arredondo transmitted a brief
and friendly note handed to him by
Secretary Lansing, expressing gratifi­
cation over the turn of affairs of the
two governments, and accepting pro­
posals for diplomatic settlement of
points in dispute. The note was ap­
proved by the cabinet before it was
sent to the Mexican embassy.
Officials did not fail to note that
Secreary Lansing had laid stress up­
on the desirability of giving quick
and practical consideration to the im­
mediate conditions along the border
which have been a source of controv­
ersy. The language of the communi­
cation plainly intimates that a speedy
solution of that problem will be
sought, whatever Ume may be allow-

of several thousand acres of farm
lands along the Red river and tribu­
taries constitute the toll of'lives and
property damage done so far, by reas­
on of torrential rains in this section
during the past week.
With a record of over four inches of
rain in less than a week, the Red riv­
er at this point was tonight within
eight feet of the highest level attain­
ed during the spring flood, and it still
is raising very rapidly.
The drowning of Ralph A. Nelson
of Peoria, 111., in the swollen Buffalo
river, eleven miles east of Moorhead,
Minn., and of L. L. Lloyd Smith at
Twin Valley, Minn., are the latest fat­
alities because of the floods in tribu­
taries of the Red river. Nelson was
drowned trying to swim across the
stream to the rescue of marooned cat­
tle while Smith, a boy of 16 years,
was drowned when he became caught
in the swirling waters of th« Wild
Rice river, which is out of its banks.
Previous drownings due to the flood
were at Mooreton and Rutland, N. D.,
a boy and a man being claimed.
The Red river in Fargo is again lap­
ping at the foundation walls of the
city auditorium. Island park is com­
pletely cut off, and a great lagoon at
the foot of Broadway, as well as the
paved street beside the dam, have be­

sumed the appearance of a beach city

Many at the capitol discovered the

early this week and have taken time
from their daily cares to take a jaunt

The rooms are located so high that
they always get a breeze and still
the sun does not heat them like it
does thoSe of the tax commission di­

Consequently, Miss Vallely, steno­

has had lots of visitors this week and
some of the other girls in the capitol
were rather upset until they found
that the refreshing breezes brought

Steps toward securing an up-to
date ambulance for the hospital
corps of the First Regiment, N.
D- N. G., have been started and
it is expected that this necessary
part of the equipment will be ob­
tained in the near future. Attor­
ney General Linde yesterday pre­
pared a petition for the emer­
gency committee for a modern
ambulance for the regiment and
it now rests with Adjutant Gener­
al Tharalson to sign the necessary
papers for presentation to this
body. .He states that the matter
will have his attention today.
Five Pullman coaches were received
over the Soo line yesterday and eight
more were cxpected last evening, but
up to press time had not. arrived.
These coaches will be used to trans­
port the troops to the Mexican border.
The fact that arrangements have been
completed for special accommodations
to carry the boys to the frontier
makes it an assured fact that the
North Dakota militia will leave short­
ly. It is rumored that Monday will
be the day of departure, though this
information came from good author­
ity, as usual it could not be veri­
fied owing to the censorship placed
on all movements of troops by the
war department.
It was expected that all of the com­
panies would be entrained and start­
ed on their journey by today at the
latest, but as some equipment, such as
uniforms and tents, has not been re­
ceived to date, it was found necessary
to delay the start. All of the equip
ment lacking is being shipped to Ft.

morrow.

This map shows not only the progress of the great allied offensive In
western France, but the part played by the British anJ French respectively.
The area of dotted shading, north of the Somme, shows the region conquer*
ed by the British, and the area o/ the line shading, covering the banks of the
Somme and the region farther ttouth. that taken by the French. The dotted
line shows the gains of the lii-st two days, the black one, farther east, gaina

The junction between the two armies is approximately in the neighbor­
hood of Harderourt. As is to bo seen, the French on the south bank of th«
Somme have pu'fehed much farther forward than the troops on the north

SIGN TRADE TREATY
Washington, July 7—Officials of
the United States are awaiting fuller
information regarding the new treaty
between Russia and Japan before
forming any judgment as to whether
it will affect the open door policy or
other American interests in the Far
East. Outlines of the convention giv­
en in news dispatches and in brief
official reports reaching the state de­
partment and the embassies here, fail
to disclose certain features consider­
ed vital to a correct construction of

previously announced that none but
day coaches were available, but Gov.
Hanna is in receipt of a telegram from
President Pennington of the Soo line
stating that arrangements have been
completed for the transportation of
everyone in regulation sleeping cars.
Three Special Trains.
According to officials 56 men can be
accomodated in each coach very com­
fortably. It is probable that special
cars will be required for the transpor­
tation of supplies but this matter will
be attended to by heads of the rail­
roads.
The work of tearing down cook
stoves, tents, etc., will not require a
great deal of time and can easily be
attended to Monday morning, provid­
ing the equipment that is now on the
road reaches here in time to permit
the stat on that day.
Touching Scenes Anticipated.
Thousands of people will be on
hand to witness the departure of the
crack regiment from this state and it
is likely that the parting scenes will
be very touching. Mothers, sweet­
hearts and relatives will be on hand
to bid a fond farewell to their loved
ones, who are going to dangers un­
known. Although it will be a sad
hour for all concerned, it is anticipat
ed that the boys will receive a roua

Orient, officials are much interested
in a reference to the recognition of
"special interests in the Far East."
A more definite statement on that
provision is looked for, particularly
as the interests referred to are de­
scribed in the announcement as those
recognized by the other contracting
parties. This language, if embodied
in the treaty, might be adjudicated as
excluding the United States or any
other nation except Japan and Rus­
sia from having any voice in determin­
ing what property might be regarded
as Japanese or Russian in Manchuria,
or Mongolia.
The Japanese embassy received a
cablegram saying that the con
had been signed at Petrograd.
