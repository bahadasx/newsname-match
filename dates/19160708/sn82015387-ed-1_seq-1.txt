1916, at the ageof 67 years, 10
months, 18 days. He had been in
poor health for some time, and dur
ing the past few weeks his death was
expected at any time. The funeral
took place from the family residence
at 3 o'clock p. m., Sunday and ser
vices were conducted at the resl
dance by Worshipful Master E. G.
D.is, of the Covington Masonic
Lodge, and at the grave by Past

and Mrs, J. B. Wortham, of Coving

Mr. Warren was a prominent fig
ure in the politics of St. Tammany
parish, and one of the most popular
men in public life. He was born
on the old pantation home, "Shady
Grove," Washington parish, August
13, 1848, 'where he spent his earl3
life, and built up the rugged donsti
tution and health that enabled h:
to fight the battle so tenaciously in
his latter days when he was over
taken by illness.
Mr. Warren received his educa
tion in the public schools of Wash
Ington parish. As a young man hi
employment 'kept him out in the open
most of the time. He afterward'
engaged in getting out square tim
her and piling, and was one of tl
contractors who furnished the tim
her for the building of the North
eastern's trestle across Lake Pon
ehartrain. When he became 21
years of age he joined the Pearl
River Lodge No. 125, F. & A. M..
now located at Angle, and later when
he moved to Covington 'became affili
ated with Lodge No. 188, F. & A. M.,
of which he was Worshipful Master
for many years, and of which he had
the honor of being a life member.
On Decendber 15, 1870, Mr. War
ren married Miss Arthemise Maille,
and this union was blessed with five'
children, Mrs. Louis J. Heintz, Mrs.
John T. Stroble (deceased), Mrs. W
E. Blossman, W. J. Warren and
Sarah Edtelle (deceased).
Mr. Warren's popularity made him
an available candidate for clerk c
court and he was persuaded to enter
the race for this office, and (being
successful was sworn in and entered
upon his duties June 13, 1892, whichl
office he held for five terms, until
1912, when he was succeeded by Mr
E. J. Frederick.
On Septeanmber 16, 1908 Mrs. War
ren died, after an illness of some du
ration, and March 23, 1910, Mr.
Warren became united to Mrs. Core
Womach. There were no children
from this union.
lMr. Warren was of a kindly dis
position, always ready to do a favor
and did much work during his terr 1
of office free of charge for those
whom he thought could ill afford tU
pay, and he was always apprecia
tive of friendship. His funeral wa: 2

large procession attended the body.

Attempting to Get Car

Gus Tousette, Ezbon Cooper, L. A.
Mitchell, Warren Pierce, Oliver Wil.
liams and Chess Mizell canme to Cov- I
ington from Sun to attend tlhe fun
eral of H. R. Warren, Sunday. TLe
Ford car they were in was driven by
Gus Tousette. Returning home in
the evening they were seen driving
rapidly out Boston street. They had
hardly crossed the bridge when the
news came into town that there had
been an auto accident. Quite a
crowd (went out to see what had hap
pened to the car, as it was said nc
one was hurt, beyond a few bruises.
The car Was turned over in the ditch
about 300 feet from4the bridge. The
ditch is a'bout three feet deep at this
point. 1Ropes were attached to the r
car and two automobiles were try
ing to pull it out. Gus Toulette war
sitting in the car, which had been
righted, and was.attempting to keep
the front wheels straight while pull
ing was being done. At a halt in
the proceedings Tousette got out of
the 'car,, but as it started he at
tempted to jump in again. .He did
not reach the seat but was dragged t
labout twenty-ive feet, hanging to
the side of 'the car. His left arm
must have been jerked against the V
broken wind shield, for when the cai c
stopped it was found that a large
piece of flesh had been gouged from t
his arm just below the elbow. He
persisted that it was nothing to both
er about, but it was evident he would u
bleed to death if something was no
done to check the flow of blood.
lady in the crowd rushed forward
and tied her handkerchief around
his arm and he was put in a car and
taken to Dr. Heintz's office where the
doctor put him on the operating table
and dressed the wound. Blood war
everywhere and it looked as if Tou d
sette had been through a railroad
accident or had been cut to pieces.
The car was not much damaged ti
apparently, and moved off under its h
own power after it was extricatesr
from the ditch. ¶

The threatened storm caused con
siderable anxiety, Wednesday amonj
those who passed through the storn
last September, and as night drew
near and the wind increased a num

New Southern Hotel, among them be

side of the blowing of a tree on the
roof of the Coco residence 'on 21s

limbs from trees no damage has been
reported in Covington. Telephone
lines were damaged to some extent
but there was one good line to New
Orleans.
The excursion train to New Or
leans on the N. O. G. N. reached 8li
dell at 7 p. m. and had to remain:
there all night, reaching New Or
leans at 9:30 Thursday morning
People were unable to get anything
to eat, as the hotels had only enough
for their own guests, and everything
the butcher boy had was soon dis
posed of. One man got a hot pot of
coffee and divided ft as far as i
would go, so it was a hungry bunch
that reached New Orleans.
The boat could not make the tril
back from New Orleans and was tier"
up. there. The large stores in New I
Orleans dismissed all the girl clerk ,
at 12 o'clock Wednesday noon, bn'
the men came on at night to watch
the stores. Many people went to th( I
federal building for safety. i
Thursday evening a heavy rain I
storm set in and continued through I
the night and lp to 11 o'clock Fri I
day morning. In fifteen minutes at
ter it commenced the streets were 1
flooded in the lower sections of the
town. The rainfall was exceedingly I
heavy, probably one of the heaviest I
occurring in this section since 1898. 1
The schooner Rosa A was washed
from her moorings at Covington and
was swept down the river, but the I
mate went after her and succeeded 1
in getting her anchored. ]
Mr. Scheff, a boy about 14 years
old and the driver were carried from
the road at the end of the Covington I
bridge while attempting to cross in al
surrey. A rope was thrown to them
and all were saved, but it wag $ nar
row escape. The horse was gotten a
out, but the surrey was washed away
in the swift current and may never 7
be recovered. The Covington bridge 1
was under water for the first time. A

morning about 3:30 o'clock, Mr.
Emile Frederick wis returning from
the wake of Mr. Warren, when he
noticed a negro with a heavily pack
ed sack on his back walking down
Jahr.cke Avenue. He followed and
watched him, and saw another negro
coming as if to join him. This no
gro he stopped and questioned. Thr
negro said he was out early because
he had been to a wake. Later, Bab
Sampson, a negro, found Sam Ruffin
sitting on the gallery of Horace
Alelaus' place. Alexius is a dealer
in old junk. ,He asked him what he
was doing there, and not being satis
fied with his answer he told him he
had authority to arrest him and took
him in charge. In the meantime
Night Marshal Loyd had gained in
formation that led him to believe
that some of the stolen hides had
been sold to Aleiaus, and he an
Deputy Lacroix took Ruffin to a room
and questioned him. As a result
Bob York and Nelson George were
also rounded up and all three were
brought together and questioned
with the result that they were looked
up in the parish jail charged with
stealing hides.
Six of the seven hides were recov
ered at the Horace Alexius place.
Two of the hides were identified b.
A. J. Planche and two by Mr. Frye
'It is supposed the negro seen by

SHALL PARISH
FAIR BE OPEN
,ON SUNDAY
This Question D ecussed By
Board of Directors. Cata
logue Com. Appointed.
At a meeting of the directors of
the Parish Fair Association, Wed
nesday, the question was diseeused
as to whether it would be` advisable
to keep the fair open Sunday. There
ale some who are opposed to this,
'but it is considered that a majority
will be in favor of doing so. While
the vote at this meeting would have
resulted in a decision in favor of
keeping it open on Sunday, the bad
weather had causpd a small attend
ance and, the matter was allowed to
go over until Friday evening, when
there will be another meeting of the
board and the matter will be thresh
ed out. There is little doubt th~at it
will, finally be decided to open on
Sunday. Sunday is big fair day in
many of the parishei, because it
,brings many farmers to town with
their families, it being a most oon
venient day for them for an outing.
Robt. L. Aubert was elected on
the board, vice`W. E. Wood, who iF
in St. Franeisville.
The question was also discussed
of trying to get the State University

will be invited to speak. It is
thought this could be accomplished.

"R. L. Camp, VM. Nielsen and N. H.

and Planeh out of the boat. The
boat was righted and the trip was
made to the house by holding to the
trees. Three women, one child an,
two servants were taken to aafet.
Mrs. Morphy and children were
taken from their boei after the wa
ter was over four feet in the room.
Mrs. ,Morphy was standing in water

badly washed and daoed.
Quite a lot of pigs chickens
