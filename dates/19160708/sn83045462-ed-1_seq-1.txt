the fight of the British troops in
the sector north of the Somme river.
The great natural and artificial difficulties
with which they have to contend
are realized and all agree that they are '
doing as much as humanly possible.
French military opinion is that the
German positions are so strong and so
v-el! furnished with lines of communi- .
cation that the British will be able to
accomplish little more until the heavy
French guns are installed inside the
French salient, whence they can enfilade
the German positions opposite to

"On the Galician front there were artillery

lage of Sadsavki, east of Delatyn, we I

"Southeast of Lake Xarocz (south of '
the Dvinsk) the Germans made a fierce'
counter attack and reconquered part of
the trenches they lost yesterday. The
fighting continues. On , a considerable
part of the front between the Upper j
Niemen and the Pinsk marshes there i
were violent artillery duels. East of
Baranovichi, in the region of the village
of Od'hovtchi ria, the Germans
pressed us back slightly as a result of
a violent counter attack, but our concentrated
fire compelled the Germans to
withdraw:. In the Baranovichi region '
our mat-bine guns engaged in duels
with German machine guns in the
course of several night attacks, and re- '
din ed them to silence.
"In the recent fighting the machine
gunner. Aioda. particularly distinguished
himself. Although wounded in the head
and bruised by splinters, he did not
desert his post, and he inflicted enormous
losses on the enemy."
German Position Untenable.
The retirement of Gen. von Bothrner's
army westward from between the Stripa
and Zlota Eipa rivers has begun. With
the occupation by the Russians of the
east bank of the Koropice river, which
parallels the Stripa twelve miles to the
west, and a further advance by Gen.
between the Dniester and the
Pruth, von Bothrner's position became
untenable.
According to Col. Shumsky, the military
critic of the Bourse Gazette, von
Bothmer is hurriedly moving his troops
in the direction of Stanislau, the important
railroad center, sixty miles
south of Bern berg. Col. Shumsky believes
that the German general proposes
to make a stand <>r? a line from
Stanislau' to Halicz. Military critics
doubt, however, his ability to maintain <
this line. 1
In the region of Baranovichi few
changes of importance have occurred,
but the fighting has been marked by
fier'-e attacks by the enemy, which re,sulted
in heavy losses for them. (
Commenting on the battle on the
Kolki-Czartorysk front, where the Rus- '
sians yesterday captured 2,300 prisoners,
Col. Shumsky savs: ]
"This is the first time that a large
rorce or tiermans nas noen put to
flight." He gives as one reason for this
the fact that the Germans have been
driven to employ young and unsea- <
soned troops and officers.
The large percentage of Germans
among the last hatch of prisoners? '
4,000 out of a total of 11,000?is worthy ,
of note. The Russian soldiers have dubbed
the Austrians "noble enemy," due
to the fact that they have surrendered
In such large numbers.
Guns Do Fearful Execution.
LONDON, July 8. 4:51 a.m.?"Fighting
on the Lutsk front continues day
by day, with little variation," says a
dispatch from that city to the Times.
"It is true, however, that the heavy
guns of the Germans create great losses
and enable them frequently to take
Russian positions, which are virtually
without exception retaken by Russian
counter attacks," the correspondent
continues.
"Probably the heaviest fighting has
been near Rojitche. where the Germans
had eighty heavy guns so placed
as to bear on any point of the Russian
line. The battles here continue without
intermission, heaping up thousands
of (ierman dead daily, but having no effect
on our lines. There are indications

ORPET'S LAWYERS STILL
PURSUE SUICIDE THEORY
Effort to Show by State's Witness
Cause of Marion Lambert's
Death.
WAUKEGAN, 111., July 8.?Further
fefforts are to be made today by the attorneys
for the defense in the trial of
Will H. Orpet for the murder of Marion
Lambert to get Dr. Ralph Webster,
the state's witness on the cyanide potassium
feature of the case, to make
innitionai admissions wnicn wiuiu ne.p
the defense's theory that Marion committed
suicide.
Toward the close of yesterday's session
Attorney Potter for Or pet. had
succeeded in obtaining several statements
from the witness which contradicted
previous statements in the ex- \
umination-of several days ago. These
related principally to the cyanide
which Orpet's father used in his gardening
work and in them the witness
admitted that he was not prepared to
say that it was not sodium cyanide, as
claimed by the defense.
Miss Youker's Letter Made Public.
In connection with the testimony of
Mrs. Claude Youker, sister-in-law of
Miss Celestia Youker, Orpet's reputed
fiance at one time, and sister of Miss
Dorothy Mason, who testified for the
defendant several days ago, what purported
to be the substance of Miss
Youker's letter to Orpet while he was
in jail here was made public today. In
this letter Miss Youker declared that
she had remembered that Orpet had
threatened to kill any one who might
come between them and that this convinced
her that the tragedy had been
for her sake. She then urged Orpet to
make confession, but he declined in
rather forcible language.
It is expected the state will finish its
rebuttal testimony before adjournment
tonight. In that event the argument
will begin Monday.

:AKE AUCTION BILL
NOW BEFORE HOUSE
/leasure Is Favorably Reported
From Committee on District
of Columbia.
)ESIGNED TO ELIMINATE
CROOKED'BUSINESS FIRMS
Washington Seems to Have Become
Mecca for Fake Auctions."
Report Declares.
The "fake auction bill," designed tc
revent fraud at public auctions in the
)istrict of Columbia, was favorably
cported to the House today from thf
ommittee on the District of Columbia
i'he bill is aimed at the notoriously
crooked" auction establishment
inhere every variety of cheap plater
ewelry has been sold by wily aucioneers
to credulous customers.
The necessity for such a law hat
een impressed upon Congress by committees
of business men, particularly
etail merchants, who have been ir
onference with Chairman Johnson ol
he District committee on several ocasions
for the purpose of perfecting
he bill. Laws relating to auctions, at
ar as present statutes are concerned
/ere not drawn to cover the fake aucion
of today, ag that pest of the merantile
world had evidently not mad?
ts appearance at the time the regulaions
on the subject were drafted.
IThder the proposed law, as representd
in the bill favorably reported toay,
no auction can exist in the Disrict
-of Columbia without a permit
com the Commissioners, who must
rst ascertain the nature of the aucion.
If brass watches are being sold
d credulous purchasers under the guise
f gold ones, or glass stickpins are
oing under the hammer at diamond
rices, or if any other of the many
ricks of the fake auction are in evience,
the Commissioners would have
he right to refuse the license and
revent the fraud from existing.
Ordered Reported in May.
The "fake auction bill" was ordered
avorably reported as long ago as May
nd would have been before the House
efore now had not Chairman Ben
ohnson of the District committee gone
o his Kentucky home for a rest. H<
irected that the report be filed
'hrough a misunderstanding the reort
on the bill was not prepared unti
esterday.
The report itself is brief, containing
he ordinary recommandation that th<
ill should pass, and also the following
iaragraph:
"Washington seems to have becom<
he mecca for fake auctions. Not onlj

FEDER AL EXPERTS
COMBAT EPIDEMIC
Assistant Surgeon General
Rucker Directinn the Work
Being Done in New York.
OTHER STATES ALERT
TO EXCLUDE DISEASE
Children Barred From Libraries and
Picture Shows?Fewer New
Cases Are Reported.
, NEW YORK. July 8.?Asst.
Surgeon General W. C. Rueker of
the federal public health service
. came here today from Washington
to confer with the local health
i office and direct the six experts
assigned by the national govern,
ment help combat the epidemic of
infantile paralysis. The federal
| experts will concentrate their efr
forts upon preventing the spread
" of the disease to other states.
' "These inspectors from.the public hoe'
pital service," said Dr. Haven Emerson,
' the city health commissioner, "will not
take over our administration. They are
empowered to go anywhere and adopt
! any measures not allowed the experts
of our department. We cannot go beyond
the city limits."
Dr. Emerson declared it would be Impracticable
to prevent parents and children
from leaving the city, even though
they came from infected districts. No
known cases may be moved, however, and
none will be permitted to leave New York
I city, and all persons in contact with the
disease must remain here.
i Although this was the hottest da^
1 since the beginning of the epidemic
' there were fewer fatalities from the
disease than yesterday. During the
twenty-four hours preceding 10 o'clock
i this morning the disease killed eighteen
children in the greater city, thirteen
of this number dying in Brooklyn.
l wcner states Are Alert.
The health officials attached little sig?
niflcance thus far to reports of isolated
i cases in other parts of the country out>
side New York state. Advices from other
> states, however, showed that state and
municipal health officers were dh their
ground and taking precautions.
1 The epidemic here has cast its shadr
ow in -many places. Children under
e sixeten have been barred not only
? from reading rooms of libraries and
a moving picture shows, but from all
7 the amusements at Coney Island except
s those in the open air. Sixteen playr
ground streets were closed today and
I the opening of thirty-nine more was
I delayed. The children's rooms in the
. public libraries and all playgrounds
and lots were closed.
i Oil will be sprinkled on the surface
_ of the park playgrounds to make them
. as dustless as possible.
One death, the second this week;
; two new cases, making eight this
5 week, and two suspected cases is this
T morning's report of the infantile pa)
ralysis outbreak in Newark. The child
; whose death is reported today was
{ stricken yesterday.
j Health authorities of New York de5
cided late last night to abandon for
. the present at least a plan decided
; upon in the afternoon to appeal to the
i American Red Cross for nurses to aid
in stamping out the scourge which.
since June 1, has caused 196 deaths
am&ng children. Health Commissioner
Emerson said he was now of the opinion
it would not be necessary to ask
for outside aid, as the hospitals of this
city have agreed to extend their help
freely.
Fewer New Cases Reported.
Some encouragement was found In
the fact that fewer new cases were
i reported yesterday than Thursday and:
! Wednesday. All the medical men
agreed, however, that only by unremitting
vigilince and the strict enforcement
of every known sanitary precaution
could the epidemic be kept
: within bounds.
Dr. Emerson declared that one of the
! steps he had decided upon was the
prosecution of physicians who have failed
to report cases of the disease they
have attended. Court actions would fce
begun, he said, Wherever the necessary
evidence could be obtained.
Another serious phase of the situation
was reported by the Association for
Improving the Condition of the Poor,
which has found that in the congested
districts of the city frightened mothers
have interned their children in their
tenement homes, in many instances
with windows closed. Such action, it
was pointed out, is likely to have serious
effects not only on the children but
on adults as well.
Secretary McAdoo of the Treasury Department
informed Mayor Mitchel that
afrer a conference with Secretary
Houston of the department of Agriculture
the latter had agreed to do everything
in his power to facilitate the entry
into the country of shipments of
rhesus monkeys from the Philippine
Islands, which are urgently needed for
research work in connection with infantile
paralysis.
Fresh Air Work Being Done.
Fresh air work for the children of the
city, it was said today, was being
done in close co-operation with the
city and state health departments. Before
children are sent to" the country
they are carefully examined by two
physicians, and regular visits are made
by doctors and nurses to fresh air
homes. m
Dr. Emerson frankly admitted that his
department had been unable to determine
the actual cause of the epidemic.
All theories which previously had been
held apparently have been disproved,
he said. Troper isolation of the cases
seems to be the only hope of preventing
ihe spread of the disease, he declared.
