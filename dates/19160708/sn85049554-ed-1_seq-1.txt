While the entente allies on the
west front have been temporarily
handicapped by heavy rajps, the
Oiussians, under Gendral Brussiloff,
are continuing- to drive back tlie
Teutonic lines in the east, further
notable progress has been made by
the Russians near Koval. In Gall
cia a new advance of the Russians
is reported.' In the region between
Riga and Volhynia the Germans
show more resistance.
In -the western theater a rainy
night was employed chiefly by the
British in strengthening positions
won yesterdajf. The French were
busy wittf minor operations on the
Bomme front, making a surprise
attack near Belloy-en-Santerre and
gaining ground east of Estreea in
hand grenade operations.
London. July 8.:—With the aid of In
numerable guns and wares of Infantry,
the British army continues to make

Notwithstanding the enormous call
on Gerinanv reserves for the battle in
PlCardy, the German crown prince has
resumed thfe offensive at Verdun and
yesterday made further repeated at
tacks near Thiaumont work, without
meeting any success.
In the east things are moving more
tepidly. The Russians are making
progress In their drives against the
junctions at Delatyn in Galicia, Kovel
In Volhynia, and Baranovichi, north o^
the Prjpet marshes.
Russians Threaten' Kovel.
.1 Little news -has come in_ regnrd to
tW fighting near Baranovichi. In Ga
licia, however, the Teutons admit the
withdrawal of their lines, the retire
ments being forced by the rapid ad
vance of the Russians in Galicia and
the successful manner in which they
met the German counter attacks near
the Lutsk sector.
The Russians having cut the eastern
most lines of retreat in the Carpa
thians, the Russians are on the flank
of .the Austrlans on a line frcm Halisz
and Stanislau. General von Bothmer
may be compelled to fall back even
farther befdre -he reaches safety.
Advancing all along the line the Rus
sians now threaten Kovel from three
sides.
Fight Is' Described.
British correspondents at the press
camp, British army in France, send
the following account of Friday's of
fensive:
"JIard lighting started today as soon
as dawn broke and is still continuing.
Soma of our troops made a brilliant at
tack on Contalmalson, and succeeded
In capturing about BOO prisoners. The
enemy counterattacked with five bat
tallons ot the Third Prussian Guards
division, who suffered great losses.
Some of. these-men, who fell into our
hands, commented on the accuracy and
intensity of our artillery Are.
"In a separate attack we obtained a
footing in Mametz wood. On the left
of this attack our troopB made an ad

and La ^oisselle, and much improved
our positions.
?On the northern part of our front

i' Small Advance by French.
Paris, July 8.—The French made a
further advance last night on th^
Somme front in the vicinity of Belloy
en-Santerre and Estrees, the war ofglce
announced today.
The gains as a whole in this sector
were not large, operations being hin
dered by bad weather. Several hun
dred Germans, were, captured.
On the Verdun front there were
violent artillery engagements near
Ksnes and Souvllle.
Russians Push Lines Forward.
Petrograd, via London, July 8.—The
Russian advance in the Czartorysk re
gion, in which- the attacking German
troops were thrown back yesterday,
bai been pushed farther. The war of
fice announced the capture of the vill-'
ages of Dolzyca and Gruziatyn. The
number of German and Austrian pris
oners continues to increase.
On the front of the Stokhod river the
Germans are maintaining a very vio

GERIMAN6 DAM HUMAN WAVE.
Berlin Reports Efforts to Check British
Flood of Men 1a Successful.
Berlin, via London, July 8.—Today's
news from the western front throws
little light on the fighting of the last
twenty-four hours, but .advices re
ceived here show the fighting just
preceding was most intense at three
points, at Thleval, around Hem, and
in the region eight to ten miles south
of the Somme.. In the first district
there was a succession of bitter at
tacks and counter attacks. The Brit
ish several times obtained a foothold
on Thievai but each time were ejected.
Their losses are described as "extra
ordinarily heavy."
The only British success, and this
was unimportant, was the capture of
trenches east of LaBoisselle, only a
short distance east of the original Ger
man line.
Loss of Hem-Admitted.
The Germans have thrown a strong
dam around the British flood wave and
attempts to breakvthe dam have been
unsuccessful. The capture of Hem was
accomplished by the French only after
three desperate attempts. The first
two onslaughts were repulsed. The
third assault gave them possession of
the village.
The fighting at Estrees and Belloy
en»9anterre also was of a Hand to hand
character. The wave of Dattle swept
back and forth with both French and
Germans resorting chiefly to the use
of thfe bayonet and hand grenades,
fighting with utmost desperation. The
losses, as to be expected in this sort
fighting, were very heavy. The
French Onaljy remained masters of
Belloy.

Position Made Clear.
Paris, July 8.—The French govern
ment, following the example of Great
Britain, has abandoned the declara

maritime law. A decree to that effect
appears in the morning's official
Journal/
A memorandum says that the rules
of the London declaration were
adopted at the beginning of the war
as being the most expedient but that
experience has shown that they did
not give the results expected. Conse
quently, circumstances obliged the
allies to modify the rules of the
declaration. But these successive
modifications led to false Interpreta
tions of the allies' motives, therefore it
was decided better to return to the
original rules of international law as
generally accepted.
