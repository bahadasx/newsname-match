FREE FAIR
PROSPECT
IS BRIGHT
Better Premium List, BumPer Crops and
Increased Interest Make Outlook En
couraging, Says Cooper; Meet
ing of Boards Called
TWENTY TOWNSHIP
EXHIBITS PLANNED
Must Begin Now and Push Collection of
Best Products in Order to Get
High Honors at State
Show
wiin a better premium lint, more
people interested and prospects for
bumper crops all over the country,
Grady county will have a greater sys
tem of free fairs this year than last,
and if all work together and pull for
it, there Is no reason why Grady
county should not stand right at the
top in the contest for state honors,"
said O. C. Cooper, this morning. Mr.
Cooper has just called a meeting of
the executive board and all the town
ship free fair boards, for July 17, when
they will decide just how many town
ship fairs will be held, what premiums
will be given, and the dates for each
one.
The executive board includes I. W.
Helm, PoeHsset, president; Aithur
Krsland, Chit-kasha, secretary; Dr. It.
J. Gordon, N'innekah; H. M. Snielser,
Amber; J. W. Kayser. Chiekasha ; W.
O. Xorvelle, Alex; T. J. Brown, Tnttle;
and O. C. Cooper, agent, Chickasha.
A total of forty-two men, including
the twenty-one township boards, will
attend the meeting.
"If we nre to have twenty successful
free township fairs, a great county
fair oil Sept. 1 i, la and 10, and a fit
ling exhibit at the state fair, we've
got to get to work right now and pro
pure for it," Agent Cooper declared
this morning. 'We have asked for
$1,500 for the premium list. This will
be twice? as much as was offered last
year, it is about the same that other
counties that are most successful are
giving.
"liveryone last year complained that
the premiums offered were not large,
enough. That one could not afford to
be bothered with preparing exhibits
for the chances of a return lor the
trouble when the return itself was so
Kinail. They were light, especially in
the matter of live stock, which is of
ten prepared for exhibition at a con
siderable cost in leed and care. Sj
we have asked for a larger sum t-i
give for premiums. There is no losi;
the money is put up by the tax payeiV
and it goes back to a very large num
ber of them, and it is necessary to
the success of the fair. The difference
between a small premium list and a
larger one means a lot to the showing
Grady county can make this, fall."
Mr, Cooper is already spending much
time in looking up exhibits. "We
want every farmer in Grady county to
show something." he said. "Those
standing the best chances of prizes
are the ones who prepare for the event
farthest ill advance. Farmers are now
threshing. They should save halt a
dozen of the best bundles from t hell
fields of wheat, oats, barley, etc. The
wet weather will produce an enormous
crop of alfalfa. They should save
nome of the best of this."
The fruit exhibit this year may de
cide between two otherwise equal
showiiiKs for first place at the state
fair, the county agent declares. The (
reason is that there is practically no
fruit in the entire country. "If you
have any fruit of any kind, save it,"
Mr. Cooper said. "If you have a sin
gle peach tret- with fruit on it, let me
know. I will come to your place,
bring the jars and fluids necessary,
prepare the fruit for you and exhibit It
in your name. It will take no more
than nine or ten peaches to fill a jar
and you may get a good prize on it.
Besides this, it increases the chances
of Grady county to take a leading
place at the state fair."
One of the greatest problems of the
year. Mr. Cooper says, is this very
fruit problem. He declares that he
does not know of a pear In the county,
and that he would be pleased to find
even one specimen w ith which to com
plete the exhibit. People-who have
plums are almost as much in demand,
or even apple.
The agent Is advising that everyone
iu the count); decide right now what
he or she expects to enter, and to pre
pare those things with all possible
rare. "If you have u corn field that
looks particularly good," ho suid,
"give it some special care. Cultivat
It after the rains at least once. Plant
some late garden stuff, radishes, let
tuce, beets, turnips, etc. Save large
tomatoes. Begin right now to give
your best live stock a little extra care,
especially the colts, pigs and calves.
The prizes will be worth the trouble,
besides the benefits that come from
JM winning."
Grady county produced the largest
pumpkin in the state last year, the
agent says we must duplicate the feat.
He gives the following instrucions for
obiainings the largest pumpkins and
lm Ions. "Remove from the vine all
b it about, two melons, then prepare
some sweetened rainwater In a bottle,
with a yarn string. Hun the yarn
through the stem just as close to the
mehfn as possible, with a needle. Cut
off the end and. leave the melon to
ret part of Its nourishment from the
bottle. It will he both more delicious
and larger.

A. R Crouch of Tuttle, president of
the Oklahoma Congress of Farm Wo-'

conference with O. C. Cooper aud Mrs.
Nettie Coryell.
The obtaining of special women's
days at county fairs is one of the
chief objectives of the congress. Mrs.
Crouch sas. and the efforts of the wo
men along that line have been very
gratifying. She declares. that this will
be a feature in practically every coun

Kl Paso, Tex., July S. A baud of
Villistas of unknown strength is rush
ing toward the border at Big Hen-4 for
raid on American towns, according to
information brought here this morn
ing. The band is reported to have left'
Falomir. yesterday, nnftiug in the gen
eral direction of Ojinaga.
This is believed to be the same band
of raiders that Carranza warned Sec
retary Lansing about. They are being
joined by small bands of bandits, op
erating in the adjoining country, end
by many Carranza deserters, according
to latest reports. News that the baud
had been, intercepted by Carranza for-
cos has not been receWed here.
By United Press.
Mexico City. July 8. That Secretary
Lansing has pledged the withdrawal of
the American troops in his answer to
the Mexican note is the popular belief
here. The general impression is that
the United States has abandoned the
idea of intervention and has expressed
a willingness to negotiate future dif
ferences between the two nations.
The American reply, which merely
expressed a . willingness to continue
negotiations has not been made public
in the Mexican capital, as is evident
from the mistaken idea regarding It
which is generally prevalent.
The sentiment here toward the
American government has undergone
a marked change and it is quite likely
that demonstrations and pawides will
be held tomorrow to show the friend
ly feeling of the Mexican people to
ward the United Stales.
May Relax Embargo.

Washington, July S. The war de
partment is considering relaxing the
embargo on the Mexican border, it was

not mean, however, that the embargo
