'Court Upholds Demand Of
I Le Meechacdb6 Against
Police Jury.
Presideat of se-called Police Jory
Eersem s imaself.
Last Saturday a judgment wis
rendered in the District Court in
favor of Le Meschacebe and again
st the Police Jury for six months'
payment as the official journal
of this parish.
The court maintained plaintiff's
contention. namely, that uuder
Act 141 of 1912 a public printer
is an officer within the intend
ment of Article 172 of the Con
stitution which in effect says
that "all officers shall hold over
until their successors shall have
been inducted into office."
We are reliably informed that
even President Lasseigie of the
so-called new police jury express
ed a similar opinion at the meet
ing of June the 28th. ult. When
asked by Mr. Gautier whether
theofficial work heretofore had
been given out by contractor not
Mr. Inssseigne stated that it has
been the custom to appoint an of
ficial printer or journal at so
much per annum, payable month
ly.
This is the same Mr. Lasseigne
who repeatedly refused. to sign
Le Meschacbd's vouchers on the
ground that the official work has
been given out by contract and
that the contract had expired, etc

A visit from the stock on

little daughter.
It gives us pleasure to
chronicle the arrival of the

the felicitations and good

Berthelot School Dance
A Success.
The grand dance given last
Saturday night in the spacious
Berthelot Schoolhouse at Lucy
La., was very largely attended,
and was a grand success" both
socially and financially. The
weather was ideal and large
crowds from Killona, Edgard,
LaPlace, Montz, Reserve, and
Wallace, La., added greatly to
the success of the dance.
Ainother dance is scheduled to
take place in the BerthelotSchool
on Saturday, July 15, 1916, and
promises to be the grandest, and
most up-to-date affair of the
season.
A most welcome invitation to all.
Come along, and lead a big crowd.

Much Ado About Quack
Police Jury Meeting.
Official Journal of the Hart Faction Is
SVery Jubilant Over Fake Organizatlor.
B
In its last issue L'Observateur1
g rejoices over the fake meeting of
the left bank Police Jury simply
because it (L'Observateur) has
t been designated by the three
newly elected law-breakers as the
t parish official journal.
e We have always said that per
sonal aggrandizement was the
sole object of L'Observateur's
bitter campaign, and its accep
tance of the official journalship
at the hands of the so-called po
' lice jury verified our former state
ments. The public is not forget
ful of the manner in which t
L'Observateur decried the $600
per annum allowance for the
official journal on the ground that r
same was excessive and should be
let out by contract. Yet when
[ L'Observateur is to be the re
ceipient of this appalling allow- c
'ance the excessiveness aLd in- C
justice of it is no longer apparent r
to the editor of that degenerate
newspaper.
L'Observateur attempts by c
poor Sarcasm to belittle the t
Honorable police jurors of the a
right bank because of their fail- C
ure to attend the quack police .0
jury meeting of Wednesday, I
June the 28th, ult. IT IS TO R
LAUGH! I
The people of the right bank d
are satisfied with their represen- 0
tatives on the Police Jury and 0
feel assured that their interests v
will always be safeguarded by tl
these worthy g4htlemen. How- a
ever, if the members from the
right bank did not attend the so
called police jury meeting of A
Wednesday, June 28th, it was
due no doubt to the precedent
established by the left bank a
members in failing to answer
former special meeting calls a
made by themselves. No, Mr.
L'Observateur, the members of li1
the right bank have never been ou
afraid to face the music, but a;
they had accepted a former invi- th
tation to attend the Babin-Cas-.pC
sagne-Lasseigne Musical and the ju
(laughing) Stock Company had ta
deserted the patient audience, in ur
which were numbered the two wI
members from the right bank, in
they felt justified in refusing in
any further invitations. Hence
the reason for their failure to at
tend the last Babin-Cassagne- stl
Lasseigne Musical Comedy (of th
errors.) re

Wedding Bells.
We are very grateful to Mr. and
Mrs. Alfred Songy, of Wall ice.

of thetrwinsome young daughter

No Justification for A Strike
(Editorial in The New York World,
June 16, 1916)
The conference of railroad
managers and rep, esentatives of
the four brotherhoods of railrcad
r employes over wages and hours
f has definitely ended in failure.
The next step must be taken by
s the brotherhods and this may
mean a strike
A strike which would paralyze
railroad transportation over the
whole country ought to be un
thinkable. It would certainly be
unjustifiable under the circum
stances.
The brotherhoods started out
wrong. Their demands for an
eight-hour day as a mere basis
on which reckon overtime, with
time and a half for overtime,
were extreme, and their repre
sentatives wore not permitted to
modify them.
It was a case for the railroads
of accepting all or rejecting all
The rejection of demands cal
culated to cost the roads $100,
000,000 a year more in wages is
not cause to justify a strike.
To farce on the roads such a
charge, which would be passed
on to public in higher rates and
then higher cost odf living all
around, is not an attempt which
can bring the power of public
opinion to the support of the
brotherhoods, already favored by
general wage advances.
Let the brotherhoods make theit
demands elastic enough to admit
of reasonable nogotiation. Short
of this strike threats and strike
votes will find no sympathy with
the public, which must pay or
suffer either way.
A NATIONAL BE tGEiCY
It is difficult to believe that the
American people will submit to
such an unjust, demoralizing,
and costly process. Certainly pub
lic opinion demands of congress
a full recognition of the present
dangerous situation and intel
ligent measures to meet it with
out further delay.
It may prove that the claims of
the brotherhoods are fair and the
position of the managers not
justified. But this should be es
tablished not by a stupid war but
unpo careful consideration of the
whole problem and of all interest
involved. including paramount
interest of the American public.
For this consideration the inter
state commerce commission seem
the body best fitted. It should be
required to lay aside all other
Swork for this critical service.
The commission, it Is conceded.
is even now overworked. But this
is an emergency.
Perhaps an emergency act in
creasing its membership might
be practicable. In any event,
eongress should direct the com
mission to act without delay and
should take whatever measures
are necessary to block a sritke
and bring about a broad and
equitable determination of all the
the questions at issue.
