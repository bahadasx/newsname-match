New York, July 8 The work of
checking inlantile paralysis in the city-
is seriously handicapped, Health Com
missioner Emerson said yesterday, by
a shortage of nurses, doctors, ambul
ances, and Inspectors. At an after
noon conference held by Dr. Emerson
and the physicians who have been as
sisting him in his work it was decided
to appeal to the American lied Cross
for nurses, but late last night Dr. Em
erson announced that the appeal would
not be made "at present".
There was one death from the
disease in Chicago yesterday, and the
Finance Committee of the City Council
appropriated $5,000 for the Health Coin
missioner to spend on precautionary
measures. Three cases have been re

in the Kingston Avenue Hospital, in
Brooklyn, 10 1 cases In the Wiliard Par
ker hospital, in Manhattan, and new

Health, although drafting every avail
able employee to the work of lighting

only an inadequate force. Comniis

ami body from overwork and under

Banks of the Somme
WAY CLEARED BY BIG GUNS
Advance of Allied Forces Follows Ter
rific Bombardment Lasting Three
Cayc
London, July 7. As the seventh day
of the battle of the Somme dawned,
bugles all along the P.ritish front sound
d attack. The call found the Hrltish
ready. Full daylight had not yet put
in an appearance when there raged be
tween Thlopval and Fricourt the licrost
hand to hand grapple witnessed since
the great Franco-British drive began.
Throughout the night, the big guns
;td been pounding away against the
German lines, clearing the path for the
infantry. For three days. General Sir
Douglas Hnlg's infantry legions had
bet n marking time, letting the camion
open the road.' today was the day.
The French, south of the Somme, far
ahead of the Itritish and holding firm
under the Teuton counter blows of yes
terday, were waiting lor their allies to
advance and straighten out the line.
When night fell the liritish had ad
vanced all along the line, had inflicted
terrific losses on the Germans and
1. eaten off all counter attacks except
at one point, Coiitahnaison, northwest
of Albert, which was regained by the
Prussian guards. There is no conceal
ing the fact, however, that tho Anglo
French front is still far from being
straightened out. The British are still
well behind the French.
London, July 7. The Russians have
begun a tremendous offensive on the
Riga front, where their artillery is de
stroying the German trenches, says a
dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
Company from Vienna, via Copenhag
en.
The bombardment, the dispatch adds,
lasted twenty-four hours and the Ger
mans were helpless before the Russian
artillery, which can now fire fifty shells
as against one in 1914.
A dispatch from l'etrograd says that
the retirement of General von Both-
iner's army westward between the
Stripa and Zlot.i Lipa Rivers has be
gun.
"With the occupation by the Rus
sians of the east lank of the Koropic
River, which parallels the Stripa

two villages and a railway station, it is
announced in tho official report from
Army Headquarters tonight.
GERMAN LOSS 16 SHIPS
British Official Estimates Destruc
tion r.t 109,220 Tons.
London, July (i. Two estimates of
the total tonnage lost by the Germans
in the Jutland naval battle have been
made by Itritish officials. The more
conservative one, who included in his
list only vessels "seen to sink" and
based his estimate on the theory that
the battleships sunk were of the oldest
dreadnought type, Rives the German
tonnage lost as 10!,220, m compared
with a liritish loss of 112,350.
He concludes that the Germans lost
two battleships of the Dreadnought
type of IS.iiOO tons er.ch, one of the
Deutschland tvpe of 13,2nd tons, five
cruisers of the Itostock type, making a
total of 24.5"0 tons for this type; six
destroyers aggregating 4,!''-o tons and
one. submarine of Son tons.
The more liberal estimate places the
Gci uutu loss at II (.220 tons, as fol
lows: One dreadnought of the Kron
prlnz type, 2,",4sn tons; one of tiie Del
goland type. 22,110 tons; battleship
I'oniinern, 13,000 tons; battle crul.ier
Lutzow, 28.0UI) tons; live Restocks, ag
gregating 24,500 tons; destroyers tig
grogntlng 4, ono tons and a submarine

MUST ASK FOR DISCHARGE
Guardsmen With Dependents Must
Make Personal Application to De
partment Commanding Officer
New York, July 7. Mobilization
camps In most of the twenty-two states
of the department of the east will be
discontinued, it was announced tonight
at divisional headquarters. Governor's
Island, as soon as tho last National
Guard organization called out by the
President has departed for the border.
With the closing of the camps, re
cruits will be trained at army posts al
ready designated, according to an or
der issued today by Major General
Leonard Wood.
It was found that the contemplated
plan of maintaining the state camps for
training recruits would enforce the
absence of scores of regular army and
National Guard officers from their bor
der commands. Under the new plan
the recruits will be trained by the regu
lar army officers stationed at the posts.
Among the army posts designated
are:
Vermont Fort Ethan Allen.
Now York Infantry recruits at Fort
Hamilton; recruits from all other
branches of the service at Fort Tot
ten.
The plan may bo first put into actual
operation in Massachusetts where tho
2.ot;0 recruits remaining In the state
camp have been ordered to leave Mon
day to join their commands on the
Mexican frontier. An order was is
sued today requiring all recruits in
New York state armories to move to
Camp Whitman where the wHrTemain
until the last organized unit depart j af
ter which they will be transferred to
the army inists.
General Wood said tonight depen
dents of National Guardsmen have
flooded him with letters and telegrams
requesting him to discharge Guards
men as a result of the recent war de
partmcnt order. He said lie wished it
emphasized that soldiers with depen
dents cannot be discharged by the com
manding officer of the department un
til the request is first made by the
soldier, with corroborating evidence.
The order commanding the Third
New York heavy field artillery, for
merly the Sixty-fifth infantry of Buf
falo, to go to the state reservation at
Pine Plains for training, was counter
manded by General Wood today. The
regiment will go instead to Tobyhanna
Pa., where other artillery units will
train.

SAVINGS BANK BOW
HAS ASSETS OVEN
$3,000,000
Bennington County Savings Bank
Makes Great Gain
$300,000 IN SIX MONTHS
Due to Steady Newspaper Advertising
and the Bank's Strength and
Reliability. ' M
The Bennington County Savings
bank now- has assets of over three mil
lion dollars to be exact the total waa
$3,050,000 on the first of July.
The gain during the past six months
in deposits was $286,000 and in total
assets about $300,000. Thi? gala wa3
one of the largest half year gains in tho
history of the bank and shows , tho
standing of the institution.
It Is also due to the campaign of
newspaper advertising conducted by
the bank under the direction of Treas
urer Charles II. Dewey. About a year
ago Mr. Dewey got Interested in some
well written advertisements of another
bank and tried his hand at similar
work. In following up the matter he
has developed an aptitude in ad writ
ing and in adaptation from the writing
of others that has brought results. ,
The advertising alone did not do it,
but that in connection with the well-
known strength, soundness and careful
management of the bank have given it
a splendid growth.
The growth of the bank during tho
past fifteen years has been phenomen
al. Fifteen years ago the total assets
of the bank were $823,000. In 1906
the amount had grown to $1,245,000
and ten years later, the three million
mark has been passed.
The management of the bank is in
the hands of a board of trustees com
posed of I. E. Gibson, J. R. Judson,
John Robinson, E. U. Welling, Harri
son I. Norton, Fred S. Pratt and D. F.
