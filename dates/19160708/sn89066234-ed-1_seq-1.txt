Last month the two grand old
frauds, known as the Democratic
and Republican parties. Ik Id na
tional conventions, and the men
who furnish tin- votes had about
as much to do with cither .is they
have to do with the notions of
congress,
First to meet was the Republi

were assembled tlic lawyers of

1 read an article by Qenc Debs In
the Ripsaw in which he quoted
someone as saying. "There arc

Near by was assembled that
aggregation of reformers. many

Progrssives, who swiped nearly

Bryan ha.- a powerful Influence
over the farmers, especially th
western farmers, and he coins
this influence into dollars during
every campaign by leading the
Rubes int.. til' capitalist slaugh

Last year Bryan was sodisgus

that he resigned from the cabinet
Hut the st. Louts convention In
dorsed exactly what Bryan had
caused Bryan to quit, and now
Bryan will tell you that Wilson Is
ail right. In the last Issue of bis

The joint meeting was arranged-

a meaningless plank in their pint

Tin- part that this country has

through corrupt deals with the

almost all of the natural wealth
of Mexico. Just at they have se

: To leave Heurta iu control meant
the re-establlshinent of "the

Hence the patriots again flew to
arms under the leadership of Car-

When it was found that Heurta
was toning his grip we sought an
excuse to butt In, We said that
Heurta had insulted our flag by
refuting to salute it and we scut

this country that prevented fur-

tors tried to coax tluur employes

mou people are learning that
these boards of arbitration are
always loaded, They are made
up of the "best people," whose in

down. In the ease of Mexico the

! On any question t 1 which the
masses were not overwhelming!

have easily obtained ,U00 sigua

the county. .Yet they had less
than one-s xth these,
' A petition with less than 00
was presented asking the court
to abolish the farm adviser en
tirely. An examination showed
that the petition favoring the
retention of the adviser had been
circulated all o ei the county an i
that a majority of the signers
were professional and business
men Who live In the tow ns and
that nearly one-third of these
were from Richland township, in
which is Slkeston
With the exception of a half
dozen signatures from Kelso, the
petitions to abolish the adviser
were from but two townships
Bylvanla and gandywoods, The
Signers were nearly all work peo

I belief a count would show
more real farmers or. the petitijn
against the adviser than lor it.

too small for the mob. all adjour
