Rotten Methods.

When a candidate begins to feel
himself slipping, he or his friends
will resort to rotten, crooked meth
ods and will say and insinuate
things, regardless of how far they
may be from the truth, in tne con
test between K. m. Anaerson 01
Beloit, and Otis L. Benton of Oberlin,
for the congressional nomination,
we have endeavored to treat both
gentlemen fairly. We have run
pverv nrtirip spnt to us nv Mr. An
derson With a request tO publish.
TVh.w nnt rai Wished a half Of i
ortiola cpnt tn nc hv Mr. Ren- I
ton, even though he had offered to j
pay us for our work and space. We !
took it that he wanted us to select
such articles from those sent, that
would best suit the situation here,
Any article of Mr. Benton's, which
were usually clippings from news
paper in the district, that in any
way reflected upon Mr. Anderson,
we have eliminated. So far as this
paper is concerned, the candidates
must confine their publicity cam
paign to a discussion of their own
merits and qualifications, and leave
the other candidate alone. We have
received a letter from one C. W.
Hamilton, of Ellsworth, whose re
sponsibility is unknown to us, of
fering to pay us to run a scurrilous
article against Otis L. Benton, signed
by L. H. Thompson, of Norton, and
printed in the Norton Courier. Ham
ilton insults us with the statement,
that if we refuse to run the stuff, he
will take it that we are one of the
subsidized papers of the district.
Well he is welcome to conclude we
are subsidized to clean politics, and
do not want his money for any
other purpose. To begin with L. H
Thompson, who signs the article, is
an old oroKen cown cooze-uguuutj
lawyer, of Norton, and the Courier
prints the Stuff because the editor
has a personal quarrel with Mr.
Benton, the two being interested in
rival telephone companies. There
Ins't a single statement cf fact in the
the whole article, just a lot of insin
uations to raise suspicions and put
Mr. Benton on the defensive. If by
refusing to publish thi3 rotten at
tack upon Mr. Benton, we are to be
i classed a subsidized press, we shall
i be Droud of the distinction. If Mr.
: Benton absolutely ignores the article
; and proceeds along the even tenor
' of his way. he will furnish another
evidence of his great fitness for the
position to which he aspires. tliii

yet perfected in regard to sprinkling
the streets of Hays. We, who live on
"the avenue" know the pleasure and
comfort of having Chestnut street
sprinkled on a hot day when the wind
is high. If Russell, EllisT Ellsworth,
Wilson and other towns consider it
worth while to sprinkle their streets,
why should not the most important
city on the U. P. between Salina and
Denver, do likewise.

Civic League Notes. j
SLOGAN: "For a. city clean, fcr acitr i
healthful, for a city beautiful."
At their last meeting the Civic
League took a vote and every delegate
present voted as being in favor of the
Commission Form of City Government.
We should have some form, this may
be just what Hays wants.
The treas have made such a rapid
growth this year that in some places
the branches extend out so far and are
so low that it is dangerous for those
who go speeding by. Property owners
should see to it that their trees be
trimmed so as not to endanger the
lives of those who pass their way.
We hear a great deal about chuck
holes in our side streets where the
rains have washed out places that are
dangerous to cars. Be . patient Mr.
Motorman, we are going to pave our
streets. Our street commissioner is a
man of double duty. When Hays ar
rives at a commission form of "govern
ment we will have a street and alley
man in each ward. There are e-ood
mes coming.
It was gratifying to hear Benjamin
S. Haywood, recently, commenting on
our well kept lawns and beautifully ap- !
pointed homes. Hays has a great many
homes of which we are proud. Lawns
near perfect, porch boxes, vines and
hanging baskets, that add beauty and
attractiveness. Dr. Haywood whose
home is in Washington, D. C, where
are, the most beautiful homes in
America knows and appreciates beauty.
He is called the apostle of sincerity.

THE COST OF NEGLECT.
Many people who wouldn't think of
leavirg a ten t'ollar j low tfif in the
field through the winter, will allow
some slight trouble to go untreated un
til it destroys their life.
It is much easier to put out a single
spark than to put out a prairie fire. It
is equally true of disease. When jou
first notice indications of disease in any
organ, it is time to see a specialist.
Don't waste valuable time in self-treatment
with patent medicines or incom
petent doctors, but go to a specialist
first. If you go to him before your
disease has reached the critical stage,
the cost of treatment will not only be
small, but you will escape the possibil
ity of waiting too long.
DR. SPARR has been coming to
Hays City, every four weeks since J une
1913. ' '
Dr. Snarr treats diseases of the

These figures show that sixty-sir, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the United States have ab
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and onlv nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses

Industrial Surrey ol Hays.
Within the next week Mr. Lee's
Class in Secondary Education at the
Normal will undertake an industrial
survey of Ha3's. The purpose of the
survey is to secure accurate data as to
what courses the High School should
offer to prepare its students to meet
the demands of the community.
It will require the hearty cooperation
of every business and professional man
in Hays to make the undertaking a
success.
The survey will ask, the kind of
business, the number of employees and
the length' of service; the salary and
the education of each; the personal
qualities that make for success in the
business; the educational equipment
ecssary; and the chief criticisms of
the school training.
Mr. Lee and the class ask the co
operation cf those who pay the taxes
so that the school can return the larg
est dividends in well prepared citizens.
Mrs. Christofferson has been very
ill during the past week.
Experiment Station Items-
Harvesting the COO acres of wheat
at the Station is being pushed rapidly
and will be completed Tuesday night.
Conservative estimate 'places the yield
at 10,000 bushels. The wheat is of ex-
cei J Ui qva..iiy.
Mr. E. K. Emslie, spent Friday work
ing on the Movie Picture serial of the
operations of the Fort Hays Experi
ment Station.
Many of the Chautauqua talent visited
the Fort Hays Experiment Station.
Mario Trivette expressed himself that
it was worth the expense of a trip
from New York, to see the Experiment
Station alone.
All of the 1500 bead of live stock on
the Experiment Station are in excel
lent condition. The spring lambs are
so large that many of them can hardly
be distinguished from the yearlings.
The Experiment Station force has or
ganized a base ball team, and practice
after supper each evening.
The rush of wheat harvest has thin
ned down the continual stream of visit
ors at the Experiment Station. We
still have a number of visitors from a
distance, who are studying the results
