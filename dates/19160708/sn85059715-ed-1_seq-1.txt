LONDON, July 8.?With the aid of;
innumerable guns and waves of infantry
the British army continues to
make slow progress in its efforts to
bring the front line between the |
Ancre and Montauban on a level with
the French line further south, the
' French having pushed further ahead
than their allies. This effort on the
part of the British has led to the
most furious fighting in which the1
British troops have been engaged.
. The flower of the German army has
been brought forward oppose)
them and guns and ammunition are
being used lavishly.
According to reports front Holland,
Belgium has been denuded of German i
soldiers to meet the Anglo-French of-1

London is Pleased.
In London the reports of the British
commander, Sir Douglas Haig,
are awaited eagerly ahd although the
arrival of wounded tells the price
which is being paid for the advance,
the news of the small gains is being

Notwithstanding the enormous
call on German reserves for the .battle
in Picardy the crowd prince has
resumed the offensive at Verdun and
yesterday made further repeated attacks
near Thiaumont work without
meeting any success.

QUARTET
Of Clarksburgers Will Be Featured
at Shriners' Convention
in Buffalo.
One of the features of the meeting
of tho Imperial Shrine next week ill
Buffalo, N. Y? will be music by a
quartet of Clarksburg Shriners, who
have been especially engaged for the
purpose. The quartet consists of
Messrs. W. B. Franlz, John M. jKnox.
II. L. Cunningham and H. L. Cunningham.
It has adopted the name
ol the Nemesis quartet.
The engagement of the quartet results
from the big hit it made when
it sang several numbers at the recent
big ceremonial session of Nemasls
temple in this city. Members of
the temple waxed so enthusiastic
over the melodious efforts of the
Clarksbqj? four that a movement (
was then and there started to take
the quartet to Buffalo, paying the
expenses of Its trip. The membors ,
of the quartet will go to Parkershurg

As Result of Revelation of We- j
gal Acts Brougtit On in Habeas
Corpus Proceedings.
Friday evening's Parkersburg Sentinel
has the following to say In reportln
habeas corpus liquor cases
brought in court there by Clarksburgers:
Brief mention was made In the
Sentinel Thursday that two foreigners,
Joe Nleclporo and V. Grlandonettl.
of Clarksburg, Incarcerated In
jail, had petitioned for release on habeas
corpus proceedings instituted
before Judge McDougle of the circuit;
court through J. F. Hutchinson. i
In the petition of the prisoner Joe
Nleclporo, which was filed In court.1
he recited that he Is a resident of
Harrison county, and that on July 4
ho went to Marietta, where he pur-j
J iiiKlntfow. that!
CUUSHU HJX Ijuaiin Ul nuinntj, iuui.
the said whiskey was encased In a'
suit case, properly labeled, but that |
in some manner, upon arriving In
Parkersburg the labels were detached;
that the petitioner was arrested
by Captain W. A. Smith at the
Instance and request of one J. Walter
Bee, and was Incarcerated In the
Jail of Wood county, where he now
is; It was further represented that
there was no warrant, charge or Indictment
preferred against him, so
far hs ho was-ablc to ascertain, and
that the jailor of Wood county held
no commitment from any competent
authority authorizing him to detain
the petitioner; that the Jailer Is wholly
without Justification and is unlawful
and illegal. The petition of the
other foreigner was In the same language.
It was upon these petitions that
Judge McDougle Issued the writ
which wa sdlrectcd against Sheriff
William Devore as the jailer of Wood
county, directing him to produce the i
body of the petitioner before the1
court and show cause, If any tfley
can, why the petitioner is thus held,
and that he may have such other further
and general relief as the circum
stances or the case may require, rue
case was set for a bearing at two
o'clock this afternoon.
The prisoners, who, it is said, were
arreste don Tuesday, had been in Jail
until they were produced In court today
by Sheriff Dev as Mr. Bee,
after the arrest, had left the city, and
the men had no chance for a hearing.
B. Merindino, an attorney of
Clarksburg, was associated with Mr.
Hutchinson In the proceedings this
afternoon. H. 0. Htteshew represented
the state In the proceedings.
Mr. rflteshew submitted the return
of Sheriff Dovore, who was present,
as well as the petitioner. Mr. Hlteshew
stated that under the peculiar
conditions he did not know exactly
how to proceed, as he had not been

pared the answor for Sheriff Devore
and Captain W. A. Smith, and submitted
It to the court.
After the answer waB filed the
court asked for the warrant and mittimus,
and these were furnished,
each having been dated today.
Mr. Merludino stated that so far
as he could see by the answers of the
officers, there was no. Issue raised by
them, as all the allegations In the pe
UII0I1H 01 n]H CtlOIllH were uulllllLtm
by the defendants and that the two
men, be believed, Hhould be released
The court held that the arresting
officer should have taken the men before
a justice of the peoce, if the arrest
occurred in the day time, in order
to allow them to give bond. The
court knew of no law whereby nn officer
has authority fo arrest and Incarcerate
men on misdemeanor
charges without an opportunity for a
hearing.
The court stated further that he
believed the prohibition law should
be enforced, but he was of the opinion
that the prohibition officers were
exceeding their authority and taking
the law Into tbelr own hands, arresting
foreigners who are Ignorant of
our laws and customs and, according
to reports, Incarcerating them without
the process of law and having
them tried before a Justice, where, it
is said, lines are imposed and their
goods confiscated. He intimated
that a grand Jury investigation would
have n beneficial effect. He said he
did not refer to the police officers, but
to the prohibition officers, and to J.
Walter Bee especially, as the prohibition
law was being made a mockery
by illegal acts.
He ordered the men discharged
from custody.

"Friendship Implies long association?mutual

"I feel particularly nt homp In
Clarksburg talking to the employes
of our Clarksburg plant as one friend
to others. We have been associated
together for eleven long years and
during that time by your many arts
of klndnpss you have put me under
deep obligations to you and It is a
source of deep gratification to me to
be able when opportunities present
themselves to do something for you
and the Clnrksburg plant.

In June, 1905, starting up at
that time with four mlllB and had a
i rapid growth until It attained Its
j present size. During these long
I years of operation, the plant has been
' operated tnoro steadily than any other
In the same business. With the ,
1 single exception of a few weeks during
the summer of 1913 while we had
our little unpleasantness which has
long been forgiven and forgotten the
plant has never had a shutdown, except
on certain holidays. The pnyholl
has grown from about $260,000 the
first year until this year wnen over
J800.000 will be paid out In wages.
The Phillips Sheet and Tin Plate
Company has paid from six to seven
million dollars In'wages In Its Clarksburg
nlant alone Blnce first put In op
eratlon, which him given you an
amount of prosperity such has not
been enjoyed by any other tin mill
In the same length of time.
"We are at the prosent time going
through a very prosperous period;
1 wages aro higher than they have ever
been In our line of buBlnesa.
"I want to speak a few words on
preparedness. I don't mean preparedness
In a national or military
sense?although I am a strong believer
In proparlng our county?not
for offense, but for defense?a preparedness
that will mako us strpng
enough to defend our country and all
that AmcrlcanlBin stands for. The
nrADAredness that I want to talk
about Is preparing tor a rainy day
and old age. In the natural course
of events we get older and are physically
unable to stand the laborious
work which Is easy to perform while
we are still young. I would like to
see every man In our employ with a
good bank account and a home of his
own, so.that when sickness or death
or old age comes upon you, you have
some reserve to draw upon.
"After the close of the present war
no man can predict what new condl11
tions will arise and confront us. Some
; authorities claim that there will be a
, j reaction from the present boom In
business when work will be scarcer
11 and wages lower. So I urge each one
t< of you who are at the present time
enjoying your share of this prosperity
to look ahead into the future and
little while and prepare for a period
of adversity, should the same arise.
"You are fortunately situated in
Clarksburg, where you have some of
the finest banks In the country, paying
a very liberal rate of Interest on
safety deposits and when your money
is absolutely safe.

to live in and is a town that is very

Iho future of tho Clarksburg plant Is

Great Parade.
The picnic was preceded by a great' . 3
parade through the principal streets I
of the city with over 1,000 persons ^
In line.
Every man in the parade carried '
in American flag, while the automobiles,
which brought up the rear,
were gayly decorated with the national
colors.
The national colors, which were -j
so much In evidence, gave proof of
the fact that the tlnplate mill Is a
melting pot for the men of various
nationalities employed there. No
matter from what land they came all
nre now good Americans.
Headed by Police.
The parade was headed by a squadron
of mounted police, followed by
the Italian marine band. Then came
a long line of workers in the follow- :
lllng department, annealing depart- *
hot mills, opening department, picking
department, annealing depart- ment,
mechanical department, cold ,j
roll department, tin house department,
shipping department, labor de- i
partment, and assorting department.
Each department was headed by Its
foreman.
Following the workere was another
band, and then came a crack military
company, composed of foreigners.
From the muzzle of each rifle pro
traded an American flag, showing ' >
that these men from other lands were' :\i
ready to fight for their adopted coun- a
Officials of the company rode inautomobiles,
