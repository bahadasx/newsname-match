Music and Children.
Music preserves in children that
ideality which is one of the most pre
clous possessions of childhood, and
which we would fain keep in after
life; which loves flowers and animals,
which sees the truth in fairy stories,
which believes everything to be good
and is alien to everything sinister,
which sees the moon and stars, not
as objects so many millons of miles
from, the earth, and parts of a great
solar asytem, but as lanterns hung In
the heavens.-Thomas Whitney Ba
rette in Atlantic.
Such a Record-Breaker.
Strolling across a large estate, he
came upon a man fishing. "What sort
of fish do you catch herer' he said.
"Mostly trout." replisd the man.
"How many have you caught?"
"About ten or twelve, sir." "What is
about the heaviest you have saught"
continued the gentleman. "Well, I
don't know the weight, but the water
sunk two or three feet when I pulled
it out."
The Modern Spirit.
The modern spirit is not the spirit
"which always denies," delighting only
in destruction; still les is it that
which builds castles in the air rather
than not construct; it is that spirit
which works and will work, "without
haste and without rest," gathering
harvest after harvest of truth tint its
barns and devouring error with un
quenchable fire.
Always Wishing.
To be always wishing for something
we cannot get is the worst possible
way to spend time. All of us have
blessings which are enough to make
us happy if only we are so wise as to
enjoy them mistead of fretting for
something more. --Take the pleasures
of today with a grateful heart, aad
never waste time in hoping you will
have something better tomorrow.
"What is it a sign of when one's lips
ttch?" asked the dear girl in the parr
lor scene as she towered the bitnds
and seated her person on the,end of
a sofa built for two. "I don't know.
rm sure," replied the dense young
man, as he folded his arms and tried
to look wise, "but I presume it adi
cates some sort of a cuatsaous troM
ble."-Indilsapolls Star.
Easy to Radiate Happiness
It is astonishing how much one
without money may give-a kind word,
a helping hand--the warm sympathy
that rejoices with those who rejoice
and weeps with those who weep. No
man is so poor, no woman is so poor,
as not to be able to contribute large
ly to the happiness of those arand
them.-Anon.
