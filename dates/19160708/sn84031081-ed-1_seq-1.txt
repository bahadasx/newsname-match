receive, confirm the statement from
Chihuahua that the do facto govern
ment Is making a great effort to an
nihilate the bandits of southern Chi
i.iiahua and northern IHirango. It is
slated on reliable authority that Car
i.tna. official believe that the elimi
nation of the Villistas at this time
woulu help to hasten the withdrawal
ol' General Pershing's army from
northern Chihuahua,
To accomplish .this result they ore
throwing every ounce of effort into
the running down of the marauders.
With superior numbers and better
arms and ammunition, they are be
lieved to have a good elm nee for
speedy victory.
The Information received here,
hovveier, s to tbo effect that the
bandits are fighting desperately since
they disapprove of a possible agree
ment between Carranza and the I "nit -ed
stales. Among them are said to
l,e many men who took pan in the
Hid at Columbus, X. M , who in re
venge upon General Cairunza still art
seeking to bring on intervention.
HI Paso representatives of mining

ceived reports tonight that the Car
lancisla garrison of 2H0 men at Santa
tosalia, about forty miles to the north
of Jiminez. had renounced the de
facto Mexican government and taken
the field in support of Villa. The re

current in that district, following the
