Carpenters in the employ of the
Southern Pacific company are
this week tearing down the old
ore dump in Patagonia, to re
place it with a larger new one.
The new dump will be 200 feet
long and over twice as wide as
the old one. Dennis Gleeson is
the carpenter in charge of the
crew.
Liquors for personal use can
now be obtained from El Paso
and Los Angeles by freight, as
local traffic officers of the South

had received instruction that
such shipments for points in
Arizona would be accepted
wherever originating Tucson

The Cudahy Packing Com
pany with head quarters at Los

000 worth of iambs in Flagstaff
territory, according to S. Izuel,
representative of the company.
Mr. Izuel buys for his company
in this territory every year.
Lambs are now selling around

The Santa Pe Railroad com
pany has brought suit in Coco
nino county, in an effort to have
paid back to them, taxes paid by
that company on unsurveyed
lands held by them in that coun
ty, setting up the plea that
the county has no right to collect
taxes on land that can not be
completely described.
Bituminous coal production in
the United States for the first
part of the present year was the
greatest ever recorded in any
half-year period the geological
survey announced tonight. Es
timates by the survey put the
six months' output at 261,000,
000 tons, a 35 per cent increase
over the first of 1915 and a five
per cent increase over the last
six months of that year.
If there is anybody in Oatman,
or, Mohave county for that
matter, who does not believe
that the Big Jim is a mine it is
that person's own fault. Or if
anyone, without other reason
than mere opinion or report,
thinks the riches of the Big Jim
are not as previously represent
ed by General Superintendent
A. G. Keating, if likewise is that
person's fault. Kingman Miner.
Because they keep the shrubs
and grass eaten off close to the
ground, thus making it impos
sible to obtain forage for horses
in certain localities, thousands
of wild burros now roaming on
the depths of the Grand canyon
are to be killed in the near,
future, orders for the slaughter
of the burros have been issued
at Washington, and plans are
now being made to have a great
burro hunt in the canyon. It is
estimated that there are 20,000
wild burros in the canyon

Tom Prazier, of Tucson, who
has a contract from the Needles
Smelting & Refining Co , a
subsidiary of the United States
Smelting, Refining & Mining
Co., to sink a shaft on the Maid
of Sunshine mine, at Courtland,
recently taken under option, has
proceeded 70 feet. His contract
calls for 120 feet below the 300
foot level. Another 300- foot
shaft on the same property has
been unwatered and the company
will cross-cut 500 feet to get
under old workings where ore
was developed.
Mrs. Josephine A. Saxon this
week makes her announcement
in the Patagonian for the office
of county school superintendent,
subject to the action of the De
mocratic voters at the primary.
This will be pleasing news to
Mrs. Saxon's many friends in
this part of the county, who
wish her continued in the office
which she has so successfully
filled. There is a possibility
that Mrs. Saxon will have no
opposition for re election; cer
tainly not from the Democrats,
and some Republicans also seem
to be in favor of making her
election unanimous. It would
be a nice compliment to a de
serving woman. Patagonian.
PRESIDENT WILSON.
The Democratic party goes
before the American people with
a candidate whose wisdom and
ability in a period of unparellel
ed storm and stress entitles him
to support in the name of pa
triotism which dwarfts all nar
row partisanship. His record of
achievement has won the ap
plause of his friends, the admir
ation of his political foes and
the gratitude of the nation at
large.
He has given the country a
currency system which on the
eve of universal upheavel en
abled finance and industry to
stand unshaken. What the con
ditions would have been under
republican rule may easily be
imagined by recalling the disast
er of 1907. He has proved him
self a better pilot in a storm
than the republicans in an area
of profound tranquility.
Under his guidance a demo
cratic cangress has written up
on the statute books a tariff law
which has brought prosperity
to every class of the American
people. The familiar shibboleths
of the Old Guard, the prophecies
of impending calamity have be
come the butt of mockery and
derision in the light of cold
facts. The noisy forecasts of
evil are drowned in the song of
the harvest and the hum of the
loom.
He has passed unscathed
through a crisis in international
affairs that would have seared
the soul and paralized the mind
of a weaker character. Charged
with the welfare of a hundred
million people, whose destiny
was exposed to all trie cross
currents which blew from the
earth's four corners, he has
maintained peace while giving
the .world a new and inspiring
vision of the moral grandeur of
the nation, jealous of its honor,
but devoted to the interests of
i mankind.
In the highest sense he is the
embodiment of a splendid Amer
icanism. The best traditions of
the republic are wrought into
the very fiber of his being. He
gloves peace well enough to fight
for it, if need be.
He has made if doubly clear to
I all the nations of the New and
ii,i r i ,i ti, Ti;t,.,i o t- t-o.
covets nothing which is not
legitimately its own. In trying
ordeals he has shown that the
American people ask nothing,
concede nothing, except to work
out their own destiny under the
iree institutions wnicn are their
peculiar heritage.
But with it all, the candidate
of the democratic party is no
visionary, groping in cloudland.
He is a stir in a world of realities.
He has taken measures which
insure the safety of his country.
If, out of this welter of war, this
riot of mad passions should come
a menace to the liberty, peace
and prosperity we enjoy, the
force he marshalled with an
unvaunting but determined ef
ficiency will be ready at hand,
awaiting only to be quickened
into action by the word of com
mand.
Strong, alert, tried and ap
proved by experience, he has
won the confidence of the people
and this will be their verdict at
the polls.

Federal Inquiry or
Railroad Strike?
Faced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
that would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs of
$100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
With these employes, whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by such
a public body.
Railroads Urge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement of
the controversy is as follows:
"Our conferences have demonstrated that we cannot harmonize our difference of opinion and that eventually the
matters in controversy must be passed upon by other and disinterested agencies. Therefore, we propose that your
proposals and the proposition of the railways be disposed of by one or the other of the following methods :
1. Preferably by submission to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the only tribunal which, by reason of it
accumulated information bearing on railway conditions and its control of (he revenue of the railways, is in a posi
tion to consider and protect the rights and equities of all the interests affected, and to provide additional revenue
necessary to meet the added cost of operation in case your proposals are found by the Commission to be just and
reasonable; or, in the event the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot, under existing laws, act in the premise,
that we jointly request Congress to take such action as may be necessary to enable the Commission to consider and
promptly dispose of the questions involved; or
2. By arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Federal law" (The Newlands Act).
Leaders Refuse Offer and Take Strike Vote
Leaders of the train service brotherhoods, at the joint conference held in New
York, June 1-15, refused the offer of the railroads to submit the issue to arbitration
or Federal review, and the employes are now voting on the question whether
authority shall be given these leaders to declare a nation-wide strike.
The Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads as the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred for these reasons:
No other body with such an intimate know'. -dge
of railroad conditions has such an unquestioned posi
tion in the public confidence.
The rates the railroads may charge the public for
transportation are now largely fixed by this Govern
ment board.
Out of every dollar received by the railroads from
the public nearly one-half is paid directly to the em
ployes as wages; and the money to pay increased wages
can come from no other source than the rates paid
by the public.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, with its con
trol over rates, is in a position to make a complete
investigation and render such decision as would pro
tect the interests of the railroad employes, the owner
of the railroads, and the public.
A Question For the Public to Decide
The railroads feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100,000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one-fifth of all the employes, without a clear mandate from a public tribunal that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
The single issue before the country is -whether this controversy is to be settled by an
impartial Government inquiry or by industrial warfare.
