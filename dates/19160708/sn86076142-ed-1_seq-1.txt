SAN FRANCISCO, July 8. Fol
lowers of sports in all its branches
are wondering what effect the present
Mexican trouble will have on com
petition in the different tinea of ath
letic endeavor. Hundreda of ath
letes are members of the national
guard organizations to be sent to the
border, and scores of teams are
likely to be disorganized as a result
It is generally thought at least
from one to three months will elapse
before the men are mustered out
Hehr and Pell, the eastern tennis
players, are the first athletes of na
tional prominence to be called to the
colors. Their absence already baa
disorganized several tournaments
which were to have been held. No
branch of athletics has escaped and
all are likely to Buffer.
Football will be the first of the
great sports to be effected, for it Is
the concensus of opinion that there
will be little opportunity for the men
returning in time tor the coming sea
son. The trainers and coaches al
ready are preparing to find ways and
means of filling the gaps that have
been made In their squads. Many
of these men are stars, and whether
the quality of the game this season
will suffer as a result of their ab
sence remains to be seen.
It is not anticipated that any
games will be called off for none of
the teams is known to have lost more
than a player or two, but it may
mean that the coaches will have to
do considerable shifting which will
put the play back somewhat. Where
a star, around whom the offensive or
defense of a team has been built, la
missing, the problem will be more
serious for the coach, but these In
stances will be the exception. The
University of Washington is among
the hardest bit, five members of the
squad being guardsmen.
BIG DEVELOPMENT
III NORTHERN NYE
George T. Lundlee has returned
from a tour of the northern end of -
Nye county, where he waa called In
his capacity as electrical engineer,
and he expresses himself most en
thusiastically over the prospects of
this section.
At Round Mountain the big com
pany is doing excellent work and
has enough placer In sight to keep
going for the next fifteen years. Over
at Belmont the Monitor mill is hand-
ling 100 tons daily of silver sulphides
and making a good extraction by the
flotation process. The most signifi
cant Improvement Is the order to
reopen the mine, which has been
closed since late in the seventies.
The deepest shaft is down 60J feet
and there stands 400 feet of water
which will be pumped out as soon as -
a new electrical centrifugal sinklna
pump can be installed. This shows
the faith of the owners in the future
of silver, which can be treated more
economically than at any previous
time owing to the introduction of
electricity and the success of the
flotation process. The "SVittenberg
and Mushett people are overhauling
their pumps and machinery with the
intention of resuming work In one
shaft. There are otners In the same
camp all figuring on going ahead on
an extensive scale, and I predict that
before the end of 1916 Manhattan
will be as active aa at any time ex
cept the most palmy days of the
camp."
