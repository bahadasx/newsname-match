Was Pickcd for the Job by
the Citizen's Com
mittee.
J. R. Wilson was recoaunended to
day by the Lincoln district road com
mittee to tho county court for appoint
ment as chief engineer for the con
struction of the new roads that are
to be built in that district if the $650,
000 bond Issue can be sold.
Tho county commissioners stated to
day that the present Indications were
that the bond Issue would be sold
satisfactorily probably within a week.
Mr. Wilson will begin his work at
! once and prepare the necessary spec
ifications for tho various contracts for
the new roads. Wilson according to
' the agreement with the committee is
| to receive a salary of $200 per montn
and will likely be allowed about four
assistants at a salary of $100 per
month.
Yesterday the members of the court
and the Lincoln district committee
visited the new roads In Mannington
district. Wilson was the engineer em
ployed in that district and is strongly
recommended by state road engineer'
A. D. Williams.
It was decided by the court that
the auction sales that have formerly
beerv held in front of the court houso
on Main street could be held at the
corner of the alley and Jefferson street
thus avoiding the controversy with the
city as to the blocking of the side
walk on Main street.
fOHN D.'S DOCTOR SAYS OIL KING, 77 TODAY,
WILL BE 100; GIVES LONG LIFE RULES FOR ALL
Improvements in Habits of
Eating, Sleeping and Ex
ercising Will Lengthen
Span of Existence.
Today John D. Rockefeller, the
world's rlchost man, la 77 years of age.
Dr. H. F. Blggar. Sr., of Cleveland,
who has been Rockefeller's physician
for 25 years, Bays the famous oil mag
nate will live to be 100 years of ago.
Rockefeller is following the rules of
living laid down by Dr. Biggar and the
physician gives these rules in the
following article:
BY DR. H. F. BIGGAR, SR.
The average span of life has length
ened. Three hundred years ago tho
average period of life was less than
20 yeare. Today it is more than 40.
And if the men. women and children
of today, continue to improve cei
tvin habits of life the span of life
should be lengthened to 100 or even
moro!
To attain age without being aged
you must follow certain rules.
First of all. don't worry.
D%ily wory for no good reason weak
ens body and mind. Then when the
real cause comes for worry, the re
serve force of the body has all been
used up.
We hear much of diet these days.
The chief thing to remember is this:
Do not acquire overweight if you
would acquire length of years.
Underweights live longer than over
weights. Escaping consumption in
oarly life, the underweight is fairly
safe, while the overweight seldom
attains old age. He usually succumbs
to some disease of the heart, brain or
stomach, or to diabetes.
Tho accepted standard of weight of
a man at 40 is 150 pounds, and his
height Is five feet six Inches. For
every Inch above this height add three
per cent, of the weight.
Drink enough water between meals
to keep clear of eye and pink of skin.
Fresh pure water, two or three
quarts a day, will make that brave lit
tle machine, your heart, rejoice In hav.
Ing good, clean fluid to worjfc upon.
Be sure to exercise.
Exercise makes it possible for mus
clo to throw off its waste. Exercising
in bed. if practiced every day. is bet
ter than 36 holes of golf on a Saturday
and a swivel chair the rest of the
week.
More energy Is stored up In sleep
than In any other way. The condl
tions of sleep have Improved. It 1b
customary now to sleep with frosh
air, whereas a century ago only sup
posed freaks risked exposing them
selves to night air.
Sleep after sundown carries you far

A Lie Nailed
Representatives of a newspaper which circulates more or less in
this territory have been caught red-handed, industriously circulating false
reports regarding The West Virginian's big Seven Thousand Circula
tion campaign. Their selfish reason: for circulating these falsehoods
are so self-evident, that but little attention has been paid to their clamor.
The West Virginian is giad that it enjoys the full confidence of
the community, and that the efforts of men such as this cannot jar it
from the faith.
The Seven Thousand Club has been conducted and will be closed
tonight along the same honest and sincere lines that have marked The
West Virginian's efforts along other avenues of progress.
But if anyone is inclined to act upon the advice of the newspaper
man mentioned above and attempt to make any unscrupulous proposals
between this and the close at nine o'clock tonight, the Manager of the
Seven .Thousand Club hereb yissues fair warning that this party will
receive a check covering commissions due on their new subscriptions
at once, and their votes shall bethrown out of the final count for the
big prize.'. The West Virginian will countenance nothing and stop
at nothing to make the end of this campaign as it has been all through
?square, honest and above board.
Meanwhile candidates are hustling everywhere. The big Over
land Six and the other prizes are waiting. What you accomplish be
tween this and the close tonight may mean the winning or losing of a
prize. It is small satisfaction to know that you have lost out by a few
votes which you could hav? secured had you hustled in the last houre
of the campaign.
Now is the time when you can line up votes and subscriptions that
you thought you couldn't land before. Get in every possible subscrip
tion now, and be on hand with your friends when the final gong rings
and the judges start the count a? nine o'clock tonight.
If, after the counl it made, there is anyone m the raca
lx/io /eels that there is any unfairness connected mith the camm
paign in any n>aji, or anyone mho feels that they have not re
ceived full credit for their efforts. The IVest Virginian standi
ready to mal(e it right at once. Don't?if you have a com*
plaint?talfc it to others, but-come direct to The West Pir*
ginian, where you can receive satisfaction. /
The judges have been selected because of their reputation for fair
ness and impartiality. Behind \he campaign stands the absolute guar
antee of The West Virginian that each and every active candidate
will be reimbursed for his or her efforts, and that every detail of tjie
race will be decided with fairness to all.
Frank E. Miller, of Miller & VanEvery, who has charge of
The West Virginian's 7,000 Club, contrary to thi statements made
by representatives of the competing circulation campaign, will remain
in the city for several days after the 7,000 Club has closed, for the
purpose of furnishing any information which may be required by par
ticipants in the 7.000 Club.
