LONDON, July 8.—The roper-of
fensive of the allies' armies entered
Its second week today with the allies
jverywhere attacking and maintain
ng their early gains at practically
ivery point, despite heavy enemy
»unter attacks.
A heavy down-Totir of rain through
out yesterday afternoon converted the
tattle ground on both sides of the
iomxne into a great sea of mud last
light and seriously hampered opera
ions. Despite this handicap, the
French -war office today claimed
slight further progress south of the
Jotnme. viUt the tat ins of 400 pcis-
I &
The BrtMshtroops north of the
gomme, after scoriae Important suc
cess against the German* in yester
lay's fighting, contented themselves
last night with improving their posi
tions. The fighting at the village of
Dontalmaison reached a deadlock dur
ing the night with the British holding
the western and the Germans the
eastern part of the ruined town.
General Haig reported that in the
last few dayb'the British have cap
tured twenty guns, fifty-one machine
pins, numerous automatic rifles,
xench mortars, mine throwers and
ther war materdal.
No official estimates of either the
Herman or British losses have been
nade fry the war office since the of
fensive began at 7:30 last Saturday
morning, but the Germans are unof
ficially reported to have lost from
10,000 to 40,000 In killed and wounded
iesides nearly 20,000 taken prisoners
by the British and French. Special
lispatches from Paris today reported
that 5,000 Prussian guardsmen, the
Dower of the kaiser's army, were kill
Jd in the early days of the fighting,
but this may be an exaggeration.
The operations on the (Russian,
front, where the Slav offensive con
tinues to spread and: develop in pow
er,- are toeing watched with the great
s»t interest here. London military
rritics are certain that the retirement
General Bothmer'e army under
lusslan pressure in Gallcia, Is now
rut a matter of days.
On the other hand, wild rumors
bat the Aastro-Germans have begun
general retreat from Riga to south
eastern Galicla are discredited by all
reliable news sources and are not
borne out flu official dispatches from
fPetrograd. London has high hopes
for the success of the new Slav of
fensive, tout does not entertain the
elief that General Von Hindemburg's
Ine can be smashed with the same
ie as was Meneral Pflanzer's in
Jkowina.
General Haig's report this after

fighting at the opening of the allied

[By Webb C. Miller, United PresB
Staff Correspondent.]
COLUMBUS, N. M., July 8.—Gen
eral Pershing today was again forced
to rely upon cavalry patrols for re
connaissances around his advanced
base. Yesterday the single aeroplane
was put out of commission. A pro
peller blade went to piec6s during a
scouting flight by Lieutenant Christy
and an observer, but the two men
brought the machine down safely.
At the Columbus base camp twelve
aeroplanes have been lying Idle for
two months for lack of propellers. A
rush shipment of the special blades
required is enroute here.
The discovery that military infor
mation was reaching the Mexicans
through indiscriminate photographing
here caused the placing of a strict
censorship on pictures.
Forecast of a long stay for militia
men on the border was seen today
in preparations at the camp of the
Second Masachusetts infantry here.
Engineers started drilling wells to
furnish the camp with a water sup
ply. Formal guard mount exercises
have been inaugurated with the In
troduction of the militlaafeii tfi Wit
post duty.
The formal ceremony was aban
doned in the early days of the con
centration. Target practice began in
earnest for the militiamen today. A
range of 200 yards was tried and the
men shot at a target constructed In
the form and size of a mrn kneeling.
The militiamen practiced in the blaz
ing sun for hours.
The general health of the militia
men here continues good. The only
cases of sickness reported are indi
gestion.
One Thousand Will Quit.
EAGLE PASS, Texas, July 8.—Fully
1,000 men in the four national guard
regiments stationed here will take
advantage of the new war department
order permitting the discharge of
militiamen with dependent families.
The depleted ranks will be filled by
recruits from the home states.
The arrival of several Kansas
militia units brought the total of offi
cers and men encamped in Eagle
Pass to 9,000 today.
Battery A, Kansas field artillery,
totalling 200 men under Captain J. M.
Hlte, arrived at 7 o'clock this morn
ing, together with the signal corps
under Captain W. L. Cox.
The First Kansas infantry, with
headquarters, band and machine gun
company arrived an hour later in
four special trains and went into camp
south of the Second Kansas infantry.
The First is commanded by CoL W.
S. Metcalf.

Infantile Paralysis in New

More Children's
Lives Today.
NINETY-FIVE NEW CASES
Home Defense League Has Been
Called Out to Aid In Stop
ping of the
Scourge.
NEW YORK, July 8.—Ten thousand
!New York citizens, members of the
Home Defense league, were called
out today by Acting Police Commis
sioner Leon G. Godley to aid in the
flght being waged .by government and
municipal health authorities against
the infantile paralysis epidemic.
Eighteen more deaths and ninety-flve
new cases were reported today. This
brings the total number of deaths for
the week up to 126 and total number
of cases reported to the health au
thorities to 892. Th© majority of
deaths and new cases were in Brook
lyn. With six federal officers under
Dr. Wm. C. Rucker here, efforts to
curb the disease were redoubled to
day. It was admitted, however, that
the excessive heat—it wa® nearly 90
this afternoon—was likely to cause
additional deaths and more new cases.
Suggestions of a war of extermina
tion against cats in the tenement dis
tricts in which the epidemic Is most
prevalent, were heard this afternoon.
Calling out of the Home Defense
league today marks the first time tlie
police have taken such a step since
the organization of the league a year
ago. The 10,000 members have been
drilled by regular police officers.
From four p. m. to midnight a mem
ber of the league will accompany a
patrolman on his rounds and assist
him in seeing that health ordinances
are not violated. Dr. Emerson said
the department is doing everything
in Its power to curb the disease.
Enough hospital space has been of
fered to take care of all patients.
White the federal' health officers
were preparing for active work here,
they were admittedly disturbed by re
ports of Infantile paralysis appearing
in nearly a dozen different states, but
it was pointed out these were mostly
Isolated cases and any danger of a.
further spread of the epidemic should
be quickly controlled. The deathB
and new cases reported today wero
divided as follows: Brooklyn 13
deaths, 74 new cases Manhattan, 2

Villa and His mmd Prepare
For Raid om Border Towns
Rushing Toward Big Bend Country Where Small Amer
ican Settlements Will be Attacked
EL PASO, Texas, July 8.—The Villistas are rushing toward the Big Bend country
to raid American towns, according to information received here today.
Sweeping across the country from Falomir, toward La Mula pass, a band of Villistas
of unknown strength are reported to be moving towards Ojinaga and the small Ameri
can settlements in the Big Bend border country.
The bandits are believed to be the same of whom Carranza warned Secretary Lan
sing. Carranza intimated (that his troops may not be able to prevent the raiders striking
the American towns.
The Villistas left Falomir yestertillay. The band is being joined by smaller groups that
have been operating in thait section. Many Carranzista deserters are reported to have
joined the raiders. According to the reports received here, the Villistas are well armed,
have plenty of ammunition and are well mounted.
Apparently by preconcert, the Villista bands gathered at Falomir for the movement
northward toward La Mula pass. Other small bands are known to be at Picachas, Las
Vegas along the southern slopes of the Sierra Grandes. It is believed these moun
tain groups will reinforce the raiders alt the pass.
News of a Carranzista movement to intercept the bandits has not been received! here.

ventlorw
(MEXICO CITY, July 8.—That Sec
retary of State Lansing has pledged
the withdrawal of American troops
from 'Mexico in his answer to the
Mexican note, is the popular 4elief
here.
The people are awaiting expectant
ly for the contents of the note. .It Is
the general impression that the Unit
ed States abandons the Idea of in
tervention and expresses a willing
ness to negotiate future difficulties^
[The American reply, which merely
expressed a willingness to continue
the negotiations, evidently has not
been made public in Carranza's cap
ital.]
There is great satisfaction over
the reports that Mexico and the Unit
ed States will Teach both a peaceful
and practical solution of their dif
ficulties. Sentiment has undergone
a marked change and it is ruite like
ly that demonstrations and parades
to -show friendly feeling for the Unit
ed States will be held tomorrow.
To Relax Embargo.
WASHINGTON, July 8.—The war
department considered today relaxing
its embargo along the Mexican bor
der. It will not permit, however,
shipments of arms and ammunition
to the Mexicans at this timO.
On the other hand, supplies of a
general character, which have fallen
under the embargo, probably will be
permited to pass freely for a week
or two. The occasion for the pro
posed relaxation Is the difficulty en
countered by General Pershing in
getting his own supplies through by
private means.
Movement of the troops northward
in Mexico and persistent reports that
VUla Is alive are keeping the depart
ment on the alert for possible trou
bel.
The state department believes sto
ries that Villa is still alive, while
the war department doubts them.
On the state department's view
the stay of General Pershing's forces
in Mexico would be Justified. The
war department idea is that no Jus
tification can be found. Troops will
not be withdrawn, however, pending
negotiations between the defacto and
American governments over border
patrol and other border difficulties.

PETROGRAD, July 8.—An Austrian
force estimated at between 20,000 and
30,000 has been cut off by the
Rujs
sians southwest of Kolomea.
The Austrians were massed east cf
the railway leading southward
through Jablonltza pass. The sudden
dash of a Russian Infantry body that
seized the railway station of Mik
luiczyn cut off their retreat to- the
south. The right wing of the same
Russian army, advancing westward
upon Nadvorna, severed their com
munication with the Austrian forces
to the north.
The latest reports to the war office
said that Russian troops were at
tempting to squeeze the Austrians
against the foothills of the Car
pathians and efTect their capture be
fore they can escape through the
mountain passes.
Russian aeroplane scouts report
the withdrawal of enemy heavy ar
tillery on the right wing of General
Von Bothmer's Austro-German army.
There are other Indications that Von
Bothmer, hard pressed by the Rus
sians advancing on Nadvorna and
Stanislau, is preparing to fall back
on the whole Galician front.
From the Volhynian battle ground
northward, the Germans continue a
most stubborn defense. Both on the
Riga-Dvinsk front and in the fighting
around Sokul, where the Russians
have made further progress, the ene
my is counter-attacking with great
vigor.

VIRGINIA, Minn., July 8.—Five
thousand striking iron ore miners at
Aurora, Blwabk, Messaba, McKlnley,
Elba Gilbert, Genoa, Eveleth, Virginia,
Buhl, Kinney, Nashwauk, Hlbblng
and Chrlsholm today seemed little
nearer solution of their strike than
one month ago, when the differences
that have caused three deaths and
four injured started.
Practically every underground prop
erty on the Mesaba iron ore range is
closed. Open pits are working a few
men with steam shovels, but the mar
jorlty of mining on the range is un
derground.
County Attorney Warren Green to
day said he would charge agitators
of the strike that resulted in the kill
ing of three on the range, with first
degree murder. These, he said, by
Inflammatory speeches, are respon
sible for the strike. The agitators
were twenty-five miles from the scene
of the shooting.
Picketing continued today with hun
dreds of miners keeping watch, but
without riots. An of the vast terri
tory affected is in one county. Sheriff
Meinlng has 1,000 armed deputies who

Sheriff Meinlng has asked that they
not come. Absence of any agitators
and disarming of all except his 1,000
deputies he said today would prob
ably solve the difficulties. The miners
today asked for a conference with
the operators. They claim they are
willing to submit arbitration to a
board of arbitrators that they
will
modify demands and not demand
recognition of the W. W. They will
demand a fair working agreement and
a working contract before returning
to work. Practlcaly every strike
leader was in Jail at Duluth today.
They were taken there for safekeep
ing following the killing of James
Myron, deputy, and Thomas Ladvalla,
a bystander, and the killing of a
miner here last week.
The kitchen and rear of the^homp
of a miner was blown away by dyna

on suspicion. Members of the family
narrowly escaiped death.
