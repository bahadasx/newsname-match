Second Stage of Offensive
in Northern France Is
Reported Reached
RUSSIANS MAKING
IMPORTANT GAINS
(Germans and Austrians on
Entire Eastern Front
Moving Backward
Lohtton, July 7.—-A wireless dis
patch from Rome says word has
been received there from Petro
grad that in consequence of their.
triple defeat in the sectors of
Riga, Kolki and Baranovichi the
Germans have begun to move
their whole front toward the west.
London, July 7. —The second pha
of the great battle on the western
front has now begun. The artillery has
been brought up to new positions and
is again battering the German defenses.
The bombardment extends as far
northward as La Basee and Armen
tieres, and, according to the latest of
ficial advices, Is particularly intense.
British long range guns are shelling
the German positions and the roads in
their rear. Until the infantry again
leaves the trenches it will be uncertain
where the next attacks are to be
launched.
The Anglo-French offensive is re
ported to have compelled the Germans
to withdraw some of their forces from
the Verdun front.
On the eastern front the Russians,
fully supplied with guns and ammuni
tion, seem to pass from one phase to
the next. Gen. Letchitzky's army,
which conquered Bukowina and CJJt
the railway between Delatyn and Ko
rosmGzo, is pdvancing in an effort com
pletely to overcome the Austrian
forces. Gen. Kaledines is delivering
heavy strokes against the Austrians
and Germans endeavoring to keep him^
from Kovel. The Russians to the
north have inaugurated an offensive
from Riga to Baranovichi.
From Riga to Dvlnsk a great bom
bardment has begun, while from a
point east of Vllna to Baranovichi ar
tillery preparation was followed by In
fantry attacks in which the Russians
report they made many prisoners, re
pulsing German counter attacks. Near
Smorgon the Russians and Germans
also are engaged in a severe struggle.
Rumania, it Is said here. Is awaiting
some move by {he entente forces at
Salonlki. The near east is interested
In the battles throughout the Caucasns
and Mesopotamia. The Russian army,
which was advancing toward Bagdad,
has fallen back some eighty miles un
der pressure from great forces which
were brought against it but elsewhere
from the Black sea to the Persian fron
tier the Russians are more than hold
ing their own.
GERMANS BEATEN BACK.
Paris, July 7. —The solidity of the
French conquest in Picardy at last has
been' put to the test and military men
here say it has come out of the ordeal
with flying colors, thus again demon
strating the soundness of the Brusiloff
method.
The Germans delivered a series of
violent attacks on two polpts. Th«
first of these was between Hem and
Maricourt on the Clery road. The sec
ond was on the extreme right between
Estrees and Belloy, their object being
to drive a wedge between the French
center and right where the French line
crosses the Somme river from Hem to
Feuillers and between the extreme
right and the rest of the French front.
The success of these maneuvers
would have forced the eventual retire
ment of the whole French line.
The German reaction, however, came
too late. The French had time thor
oughly to strengthen their line, to ad
vance and place In position heavy ar
tillery and to bring iip plentiful stocks
of munitions. Consequently the attack
ing wave was caught in a whirlwind of
machine gun fire from the trenches
and was shot to pieces by the "seventy
fives."
The German infantry plodded for
ward again and again but nowhere,
French reports says, made any impres
sion.
The French remain two and a half
miles from Peronne on the south side
of tbe Somme and four miles from that
city on the north side of the river and
there are no formidable natural
obstacles in the way of their occupa
tion of the city when the French com-,
mander judges that the time is ripe to
do so.
GERMAN REPORT.
Berlin, July 7.—The result of heavy
engagements that were in progress all
last night both north arid south of the
river Somme was not unfavorable to
the Germans, the war office announced
today. A salient of the German line
in Volhynla projecting toward Czar
toryska has been abandoned under
superior pressure by the Russians and
new line of defense'selected.

WITH JAPANESE
TOKIO FOREIGN OFFICE ASSERTS
UNITED STATES INTERESTS
ARE 8AFE.
Tokio, July 7.—The Japanese for
eign office today announced as the sub
stance of the Russo-Japanese conven
tion signed at Petrograd on July 3 the
following:
"First—Japan will take part In no
arrangement or political combination
directed against Russia. Russia will
take part in no arrangement or politi
cal combination directed against
Japan.
"Second—In case the territorial
rights or 'special interests In the far
east of one of the contracting parties,
which are recognised by the other
contracting parties are menaced, Jap
an and Russia will consult with each
other on measures to adopt with a
view to supporting or extending assist
ance for the safeguarding and defense
of these rights and Interests."
To a question from the Associated
Press representative as to what effect
the alliance would have, upon the open
door and the Integrity* of China, the
foreign office replied:
"The convention is effectually an
emphasis upon and an extension of
the Anglo-Japanese alliance based up
on the territorial integrity of China,
whose open door and integrity are
now endangered. American trade and
interests are in no wise affected.'*
The foreign office denied affirma
tions in Japanese newspapers that the
convention contained secret clauses,
declaring that while the summary giv
en out
waB
the substance of the con­
vention it also was virtually the text
of that document.
The accord, which Is virtually an
alliance, is regarded here as of histor
ic Importance as concerns the future
development of the far east and world
politics generally. It ends a long per
iod of hostility between the two em
pires, which culminated in the Russo
Japanese war and strengthens the po
sition of Japan as a first class power.
War Summary
A German retreat all along the line
of the front in Russia from Riga to
Volhynla Is reported today.
Unofficial news to this effect comes
from Petrograd through Rome. It
declares that a triple defeat for the
Germans In the Riga, Kolkl and Bar
anovichi sectors caused them to begin
a movement of their whole front west
ward.
Petrdgrad has recently announced
successes in regions mentioned In the
Rome advices. The last report from
the vicinity of Wolkl, in the crucial
Volhynla sector, recorded the cap
ture by the Russians of more than
7,500 prisoners, half a dozen cannon
and twenty-three machine guns.
A great battle is raging along vir
tually the entire front of the British
offensive In northern France.
At daybreak the British launched a
new drive east of Albert. Important
tactical successes were gained in sev
eral sectors, London announces.
The Germans simultaneously attack
ed in force near the river Ancre and
north of Fricourt. They succeeded in
temporarily occupying two or three
hundred yards of ground lost In the
earlier British drives.
The chief advantages gained by the
British were in the vicinity of Ovil
lers, Contalmaison and La Boiselle,.
Near the last named place in an en
gagement last night a German trench
more than a half mile in length was
captured.
The Austrians admit serious defeat
west of Kajpmea, where they were
driven back five miles.
The Russian war office announces
the capture of 10,000 prisoners yester
day, 5,000 in a battle on the Dniester
and 5,000 on other sections of the
Russian front.
The Germans admit the withdrawal
of Gen. von Bothmer's army in the
Tarnopol sector before the Russian
attacks. They concede also an. ad
vance by the British soutt» of Thiep
val in the western zone.
FRENCH TROOPS
GET MUCH BOOTY
Paris, July 7. —Work of sorting
booty taken by French troops in the
Somme fighting brings to light curious
facts. In the Mereaucourt woods a
heavy German battery was found com
pletely dismounted. The battery com
mander's shelter alone remained in
tact.
The luxury of officers' quarters in
the Santerre plateau showed tlat they
were considered impregnable. A piano,
a brass bedstead and a complete hot
and cold water supply were found.
Gen. Balfourier's famous "iron
corps," which distinguished itself at
Verdun, took enough material to set up
a whole army.
STEAMER IS CAPTURED.
Berlin, July 7.—Official announce
ment was made today that the British
steamship Lestris was held up by Ger
man warships near the English coast
and seized as a prize.
The statement says the Lestris was
held up "by a portion of th* Oerman
high sea forces."

NEGOTIATIONS TO
BE STARTED SOON
Pleasure Expressed in the
Hope of De Facto Chief
for Cooperation
Washington, D. C., Jnly 7.—A note
formally accepting Gen. Carranza's
proposal that differences between the
United States and the defacto govern
ment of Mexico be settled by direct
negotiations was handed today to
ESiseo Arredondo, the Mexican ambas
sador designate.
Secretary Lansing took a draft of
the note to today's cabinet meeting
and had It delivered promptly after
the cabinet adjourned. The course to
be pursued already had been agreed
upon by President Wilson and his ad
visers.
The text follows:
"Mr. Secretary:
"I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your courteous not«,
transmitted to me by Senor Arredon
do on the fourth instant, in wbich you
refer to my notes of June 20 and June
25, and to assure you of the sincere
gratification of my government at the
frank statement of the difficulties
which have unfortunately arisen In
our relations along the international
boundary, and the unreserved expres
sion of the desire of your government
to reach an adjustment of these dif
ficulties on a broad and amicable
basis. The same spirit of friendship
and of solicitude for the continuance
of cordial relations between our two
countries inspires my government,
which equally desires an Immediate
solution of the matters of difference
which have long vexed both govern
ments.
"It is especially pleasing to my gov
ernment that the de facto government
of Mexico Is disposed to give quick
as well as practical consideration in
a spirit of concord to the remedies
which may be applied to the existing
conditions. Reciprocating the same
desire, the government of the United
States is prepared Immediately to ex
change views, as to a practical plan to
remove finally and prevent a recur
rence of the difficulties which have
been the source of the controversy.
"Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed
assurances of my highest considera
tion.
'1 am sir, '•Yours very sincerely,
(Signed) "Robert Lansing."
U. S. MONEY IS NEEDED.
The proposed exchange of views
probably will be carried on through
informal conversations between Mr.
Arredondo and Counselor Polk, who
will act as secretary of state while Mr.
Lansing is away on a month's vaca
tion at Watertown, N. T.
While high officials have admitted
that the Washington government in all
probability would do what it could to
encourage American bankers to go to
the aid of the de facto government if
Gen. Carranza would furnish proper
guarantees, Counselor Polk took oc
casion today to state that his confer
ence yesterday with Henry Fletcher,
ambassador designate to Mexico, and
Paul M. Warburg of the federal re
serve board had' nothing to do with
this aspect of the situation.
No detailed plan as to the form of
guarantees the United States may
seek for the safety of its own and
other foreign interests in Mexico has
been formulated so far as yet.
PEACE SOCIETY IN
GERMANY IS BUSY
Berlin, July 7—Numerous scientists,
industralists and .representatives of
commerce and agriculture have form
ed a German national committee un
der the chairmanship of Prince von
Wedel, says the Koelnische Zeitung,
with the aim of "awakening a uniform
understanding of the German people
for an honorable conclusion of peace
which shall guarantee a secured fu
ture empire."
INTERNED CARGO
INCREASES WORTH
New York, July 7. —The German
sailing ship Indra began to discharge
here today a cargo of nitrate from
Chile valued at $1,000,000. When she
arrived here bringing the cargo in
September, 1914, after her captain had
learned that war had been declared, It
was worth only $125,000, but while ly
ing in this port for nearly two years,
the value of the cargo has increased by
$875,000.
MORE CHILDREN DIE.
New York, July 7.—With city, state
and federal authorities fighting the

ORPtT DEFEASE RESTS
Recess Taken to Permit 8tate Prose
cm tor to Assemble His Evidence
in Rebuttal.
W&ukegan, Ill^July T.—The defense,
after Introducing documentary evi
dence, rested today in the case of Wil
liam H. Orpet, the college student,
charged with the murder o£ Marlon
Lambert
The evidence offered was a copy of
the Wisconsin statute governing the
sale of poisons.
Attorney David R. Josylyn of the
prosecution said he wanted Orpet re
called for further cross examination
with regard to Celestia Youker, the
young woman to whom he was report
ed engaged. Mr. Joslyn said that the
court halted him on this phase of the
examination when the defendant was
on the stand before. Attorneys Jas.
H. Wilkerson and Ralph F. Potter of
the defense objected.
Judge Donnelly ruled that the de
fendant could not be recalled. Re
cess was taken to enable the state to
assemble Its rebuttal witnesses.
The sensational evidence yesterday
was the testifying by an expert that
the poison which was in the green
house kept by Orpet's father, was not
the same kind as that which caused
Marion Lambert's death.

Chicago, July 7.—Railways of the
United States in their safety meas
ures easily withstood the test
brought by the sudden flood of "war
export" traffic in 1915, according to a
bulletin issued here today by the bu
reau of railway news.
Total fatalities in train accidents
from July to September, whether to
passengers, employes, trespassers or
others, according to a comparison of
the official quarterly accident report
with previous quarters, were fewer
than in any similar quarter since the
inception of the reports in 1901. Yet
the gross business of the railways
was larger, it is said, than in any
similar quarter in their history.
The carriers handled their excessive
traffic with a loss of only 127 lives in
train accidents. The smallest total In
any similar quarter was 181 in 1914,
when traffic was at low ebb. In 1910
the total was 321. Previous to that
time employes not on duty, trespas
sers and "others not trespassing" were
not included. Yet even with this
great advantage, it is pointed out, the
totals killed In train accidents ranged
from 191 in 1908 to 411 in 1904. As
these classes are now included the
127 record is the more striking by
contrast.

DEPARTMENT IS
Street Work of City Being
Done Economically Under
Methods Now in Vogue
OLD BRICK PILE NOW
THING OF THE PAST
Problem Solved By Making
Crossings Catch Basins
and Tops Are Cement
The street department of the city
is quite busy at present improving a
number of the streets about the city
and laying brick crossings that re
place the old plank type for many
years in vogue.
The work of this department 1b to
a great extent responsible for the fav
orable condition of the city's finances
at present. It Is the doing of certain
work when It can be done most cheap
ly and with little labor or material ex
pense. This Is' evidenced In the street
work along East Second and Locust
streets and on Blsmark avenue. Dirt
that the paving company Is taking
from North Ash street in grading for
the paving, Is being hauled without
the regular expense to the city to the
above mentioned streets. As a result,
bad spots are filled, narrow places
widened and the roads brought up to
a better state of efficiency.
For several days past Street Com
missioner Stocker has had a force of
men and teams employed on East Park
avenue between Court and Jefferson
streets. Cuts and fills have been
made, the road widened and bad
spots improved. The grading of this
street will require a few more days to
complete. A force of men are also at
work on North Green street and High
land avenue in the vicinity of Part,
improving the roads there.
Make Catch Basins.
One of the practical things being
done by the street department and
one which saves the city -considerable
money in material and labor is the
making of concrete catch basins and
tops for the same. These substitute
the brick basins and are deemed more
lasting end cheaper. Rainy days and
during bad weather when the street
forces cannot do work on the streets,
a number of the men are engaged in
making the catch basins and tops of
concrete at the rear of the city hall.
Forma have been purchased for this
work and a supply of them are thus
kept on hand. One of the new type
catch basins is said by Commissioner
Berry to cost but one-third the sum
that the brick basin costs and where
the city' used to pay $4 for the iron
tops for these baBins, they now make
them with reinforced concrete for $1
and have constructed about 100 of
them this summer.
The immense pile of old brick that
for years kept growing In the rear of
the city hall and was a problem for
the commissioners to dispose of, has
now practically disappeared. Instead
of trying to get rid of them, the city is
now buying even old sidewalk brick
from persons who are putting In new
cement walks to replace the brick
type.
The brick thus obtained and such as
comes from the resurface paving work
about the city, is all being used to a
good advantage. Most of It finds
places jln crossings aboat the city
where old planking was formerly used.
8treet Flusher Saves Money.
"The street flusher that Ottumwa
wanted for so long before It made the
purchase, has been one of the best
Investments and money savers that
the city ever had," said Commissioner
Berry today. He and Street Commis
sioner Stocker were being quizzed
about the activities of the street de
partment. They claim that the flusher
has saved the city considerable in
money while it more than doubled
the service of street cleaning since its
purchase. Two shifts are being work
ed on the fluster. One working nine
hours during the day on the paved
streets in the residence districts and
a night shift of the same length in the
business districts. Both are getting
more cleaning done and better.
The result has been to cut down the
white wing force to three men and
only few brooms for this work are now
needed by the city where a large
quantity were used before. Labor is
the especial saving. When there is
plenty of rain the use of the flusher
Is lessened as only a little washing
away of debris that may be left after
ohowers that failed to carry off the
dirt, is needed. The cost of the
flushing service in June was but $167
and this figure was considered low by
the officials.
LOST YOUTH NOT

ents had sought all over the country

ing on a farm near Lone Tree, not
sixty miles from Davenport. He re
turned today. The boy had made an
agreement with the farmer to work
for him two years and kept his word.

IOWA CAVALRY TO
LEAVE FOR SOUTH
BEFORE INFANTRY
SQUADRON STILL IN NEED OF RE.
CRUrTS GUARD EXPCCT8
MOVE ORDER SOON.
Camp Dodge, July 7.—The Iowa na
tional guard, mobilised here and held
pending receipt of orders from the
war department, will move to the
Mexican border unit by unit, it was
learned today. Present plans call for
the transportation southward of the
cavalry and artillery first, then the
Infantry and hospital corps units, ac
cording to statements made by offi
cers In charge of the movement of
troops.
Officers today refused to discuss
published assertions that the entire
Iowa brigade would be held up pend
ing the recruiting of sufficient caval
rymen to bring the squadron up to
minimum peace strength. However,
Brig. Gen. H. A. Allen, commanding,
announced that he had sent appeals
to several cities in the Btate asking
that the utmost efforts be made to
obtain enlistments In the cavalry
units. There have been virtually no
cavalry enlistments for the past tw'o
days and two score men still are
needed to fill the peace quota.
Officers in charge of the traffic ar
rangements expressed the oq}nion to
day that It may be a week or more
before the order comes to move. The
mobilization of guardsmen of other
states and their transfer to stations
on the border have, it was said, de
pleted the supply of tourist sleepers
so that to transport the men at once
would mean a long, tiresome ride In
day coaches. Gen. Allen said today
he was unwilling to force this hard
ship on his men unless there was urg
ent need and It is believed he was
asked that orders to move be delayed
until suitable cars are available In a
sufficient number to take care of the
txbops.
PORTLAND WOMEN
AFTER "SLACKERS"
Portland, Ore., July 7.—A number of
Portland mothers, Whose sons are now
on the Mexican border, partly, they
said, as the result of their teachers'
urglngs, called yesterday upon two
high school faculty members and ask
ed their reasons for being "slackers."
Most of the mothers were satisfied
with the teachers' explanations. Sev
eral were not.
One of the teachers said he had
helped to organize a machine gun
company and had enlisted but resign
ed later when his four chlldren*became
111. The other said his duties in Port-1
land were more important. I

BAPTISTS ELECT
LAY PRESIDENT
Chicago, July 7.—Advocates of the
lay president plan were victorious to
day in the election of officers of the
Baptist Young People's Union of
America without taking the fight on to
the floor of its twenty-fifth annual
convention. In a meeting of the nom
inating committee and the board of
managers, the following were elected:
H.' B. Osgood, Chicago, president
W. F. Reynolds, Ontario Rev. L. R.
Scarborough, Tex., and A. H. Vantler,
Pennsylvania, vice presidents G. W.
Wason, New York, recording secre
tary, and O. O. Montague, Illinois,
treasurer.
The new board of managers elected
consists of:
F. A. Grow, Illinois W. L. Clapp,
Iowa Ed Phelps, Illinois H. G. Bald
win, Ohio F. L. Anderson, Illinois
N. B. Henderson, Illinois H. W. Riehl,
Kentucky A. R. Heron, California
John Nuveen. Illinois E. L. Dakin,
Indiana, and Judson E. Lee, Illinois.
The efficiency of a lay" president, It
was argued, was Indicated by the rapid
growth of the union during its first six
teen years, under the presidency of a
layman, John H. Chapman of Chicago.
Since that time a pastor has been the
executive head and for the last three
years that honor has been given to the
Rev. Frank L. Anderson of Chicago,
who has been superintendent of the
Baptist executive council of Chicago
since 1909.
After the election of officers, the
Rev. J. B. Cranflll of Dallas, Tex., was
to address the assembly on "Impres
sions of the Later Conventions."
The Rev. H. W. Reed of Rock Island,
I1L, read an historical address, and
the Rev. Emory W. Hunt of Newton
Center, Mass., conducted the "Quiet
half hour" before the noon recess.
The afternoon was devoted to com
