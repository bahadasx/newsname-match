GERMAN TRENCH WORKS
CRUMBLED BY BIG GUNS
GREATEST OFFENSIVE OF WAR
LAUNCHED BY BRITISH AND
FRENCH AGAINST GERMANS.
ALUES SRTIKE ALL FRONTS
Dr;ve of Allies Started After Long and
Careful Preparation--Cvcr M:l.ion
Shel:s Hurlei Daily by British
and French Aglinst Teutons.
Latest European War News.
The tremendous offensive which
has been launched by the British army
on the German front is the culinin:
tion of a five days' battle which, in
the amount of rmmunition expended
and in the tcrritory involved, exceeds
anything of the kind that has been
previously known in the world war.
For some weeks reports have been
current in England and France that
the "big pnsh" of the British was about
to cor.nla-ncc. It w-as stated that Er
rland !::d 2,00O,n00 men fully equip
pe;l and trained ia preparation for the
s :re.e effort to break the German
•liEcs. More than a million shells are
declared to have been fired daily in
the p:'eiminary bmrbardment, which
extendcd over a front of ninety miles
in lenth.
British and French troops thrown
forward in a ha . offensive aga n.t
the German lincs on both sides of the
River Somme, ixvty miles north of
Paris, have peatrated at one point
to a depth of five miles; taken several
villages, and captured a labyrinth of
trenches extending to a d pth of 1,000
yards cn a front of seven miles. The
drive, the most spectacul:r since the
British captured Loos last September,
began Saturday morning after the
German trenches had been bathed in a
hail of shells from guns of every call
ber for days.
The greatest success gained by the
British was on the right. In the cen
ter they captured what are designated
in the official report as "many strong
points" along a front of four miles.
But north of the Ancre Valley to
Gomme-Court powerful counter-attacks
by the Germans have resulted in forc
ing the British back from various sec
tions of the ground gained in their
first onslaughts.
The town of Albert was the starting
point of one of the fiercest thrusts,
the British advancing from east of the
town of Mont Auban, more than five
miles away. Besides Mont Auban and
Serre, the villages of Hebeturne, La
Boiselle and Mamets have been cap
tured. Two thousand German prison
ers Saturday passed through the Brit
ish collecting stations.
In cooperation with the British, the
French initiated a strong offensive.
South of the Somme they captured
four villages and north of that river
they established themselves in .the
neighborhood of Hardecourt and Curlu.
The number of unwounded German
prisoners taken by the French Satur
day reached 8,500.
The recapture of the Thiaumont
work by the French also has been ef
fected. This important strategic point
has changed hands several times and
around it thousands have fallen.
The fighting is most intense around
Hill 304, Le Mort Homme and Avo
court.
In the Trentino, the Italians con
tinue to advance along the entire Po
sina line and in the Area Valley. Ar
tillery bombardments mark the action
on the rest of the AustroItallan front.
While the Russians report progress
south of the Dnoaester river, in Galicia,
the Austro-Germans claim the capture
of Russian works west and northwest
of Lutsak, especially in the vicinity of
Sokul, Volhynla.
Mlaintaining their drive agatlst the
Austrians in Galicia in the direction
of Kolomes, the Russelans have cp

Probably the catch crop that re
quires less time for maturity is
;crlan millet. Harvest may be
made ordinarily in sixty t,,,sixti five
lays from time of pianing. Tile
quality of hay is fairly .good if cut
uiufore the seed are fully nllttire,
mld the yield is good onl good land,
but the draft on the soil is pt etty
heavy.
Almost any of the sorglihumi may
-e planted up to tile 1ti of July,
and varieties such as the Early
Amber. Early Orange and Cole
man may be planted considerably
later. When planted in mid-sum
iner they will approximately mature
in sixty-five to seventy days.
Sorghum can only be used to ad
vantage, however, for soiling or
for making silage.
Practically every one is familiar
with cow peas. The New Era is
one of the very best varieties for
late planting; it can be planted up
to the 1st of August and make a
pretty good crop of both seed and
hay.-W. R, Dodson, Director,
Experiment Stations, L. S. U.
Her Backach,- Gone,
Just how dangerous a backache,sor
uscles, asohilg join-ts or rhenmatit:
,ains may be is sometime:, realised
nily when life insurance is relufed on
,soouot of kidney trouble. Joseph U
Wolf of Green Bay, Wis.' writes:

where. adv
tured many villages. liorth of Rtiipo
lung, Bukowina, the Russians already
are in the mountains and they report
the seizure of several strong positions.
Attacks of German troops in the re
gloe of the LUps river were repulsed
with heavy losses, Petrograd asserts.
The German troops under General
von Linsingen have taken Russian po.
stions west of Kolki and southwest of
Sokul. Flighting is in progress south
wrt of Lutsk. General von Linsingen
dsace June 16 has captured 26 officers
and 3,165 men with his force. Petro.
grad reports the number of prisoners
takenL from Jumne 4 to June 80, inclu
sire, as 217,000 offiters and men.
The great offensive undertaken by
the British offers, according to reports
froe the front and the comments of
military erities, an absolutely new de
parture in the tastices hitherto pursued
by the belligerents. Contrary to the
hvorlte tactics of the Germans, the
British did not attempt a partial ad
vane by massing their artillery at a
given point on the line and following
an intense bombardment by an ft·fa
try attack in serried columns.
The alies are now on the offensive
in practically every field of war.
On the Italian front also the central
powers have met with severe reverses
and for several days the Italians have
been steadily drlvng the Austrians
from the Trentino.
Employtins an enormous number of
guns, the British maintained a contin
aous sad even bombardment of the
'erman lines along the entire front of
