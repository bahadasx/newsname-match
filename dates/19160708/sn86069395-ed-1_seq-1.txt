The epidemic of infantile paralysis

I June 26 to July 5, there were 702 ca

Examinations arc proceeding at FL
Thomas and estimates place the re
jections at 40 per cent, or about 1,000
of the 2,500 men. This would leave
Co. D with more than the minimum
number of 65.
The Republican committtee has
recommended Thos. L. Walker for a
place on the State Election Commis
sion instead of R. C. Stoll the present
member. He belongs to the Hert
faction.
Starving Mexican women shouting
"viva erinaoes" have stormed the
.governor's palace at San Luis Potosi,
according to reports received by Gen.
Pershinc. The real money spent by
the Americans has made a profound
impression in Mexico.
Maj. Alex Dade, in a letter to his
sister, Mrs. W. A. Glass, says ho was
with his command in both of the.
fights with Villa men at Guerrero and
Turnochief. He is in Col. Dodd's
Seventh cavalry;
Carranza's last note verges on ab
ject humility and the President now
has the opportunity to arrange peace

body lias evidently beaten some sense
into the Mexican's head.

Judge Reed granted an injunction

WAR CLOUD
DISAPPEARS
Arredondo Informally Notifi
ed Proposal to Adjust Dif
ficulties by Negotiations.
TRANQUILIZE BORDER
Militia to Be Kept on Line as
Long as Slightest Danger
of Raid Exists.
Washington, July 7. The de facto
government of Mexico has been not!
fled through Elisco Arredondo am
bassador-designate, that the United
States welcomed Gen. Carranza's pro
posal to adjust all pending differences
between the two governments by di
rect diplomatic negotiations. Later a
!ormai note will confirm the ambassa
dor's report.
Immediately after tho cabinet meet
ing Secretary Lansing plans to leave
for a month's vacation. Counsellor
Polk will administer the affairs of the
state department in his absence and
meet Mr. Arredondo in the informal
discussions at which a solution of the
Mexican problems will be sought.
AID IN RETSORING ORDER.
It was evident at the state depart
ment that officials that believe an op
portunity has now been presented out
of which may come a means of giving
the de facto government material aid
in restoring order thrpughout Mexico.
It is known that the pacific nature of
the Mexican note which brought the
crisis between the governments to an
end is construed here as indicating
that Gen. Carranza, besjdes being im
pressed by American military prepara-
i tions has been deeply influenced by
the pressure and argument brought to
bear, on him by friends in the United
States, European diplomats in Mexi
co City and particlilarlo by reports of
the many Latin-American powers.
The latter have exerted themselves to
the utmost to avert war and to foster
in Gen. Carranza's mind the idea of
Pan-American unity.
TRANQUILIZE BORDER FIRST.
While the immediate purpose of the
negotiations in which Secretary Lan-j
sing's note is to bo the first step will
be the evolution of some plan for
tranquilizing the border regions, tho
discussion may take on a wider scope.
There is little doubt that Mr. Arredon
do received the impression from Sec
retary Lansing that if adequate guar
antees as to the security of American
and foreign interests in Mexico could
be secured tho Washington govern
ment believes it possible that tho fi
nancial aid so greatly needed by the
de facto authorities could be found.
Mobilization of the national guard
continues to go forward on schedule
according to war department reports
and the state soldiers are certain to
gain valuable experience on the bor
der before they are released from tho
federal service. Just how long it will
bo necessary to maintain all or part of
the force to aid the regulars in patrol
duty cannot now bo predicted with
accuracy.
Events in Mexico will determine
that. It is certain, howover, that tho
entire mobile regular army will be
kept on border garrison while thero
is tho remotest danger of new bandits
uprising.
Double Tragedy.
Lancaster, Pa., July 7. In a crowd
ed waiting rooni at the Reading rail
road station here Tuesday night,
Charles Dawson shot his wife, Madge,
and then committed suicide. They
are said to bo from Amsterdam, N. Y.
The woman, though hit by seven
bullets, remained on her feet until
sho reached a. grass plot outside.
Dawson followed, picked her up in
his arms, kissed her, then sent a bul
let through hi own head. Both died
later in a hospital.

approximately fifty men, out of an
enlistment of 127, and Company F, of
Louisville, 24 out of an enlistment of
147. Tho majn deficiency again was

The field hospital was busy today
caring for the men who took their
second innoculation for typhoid. This
process resulted in a complete loss of
"pep" by the men that submitted
arms to tho physicians last night.
Sore arms, headaches and drowsiness
were the order of the day.
The field hospital corps was called
upon today to care for its first wound
ed man, when Private Bryant Parr,
Company I, Lexington, was brought
in with both feet suffering from bird
shot wounds inflicteds by a woman
living on the river bank just outside
the grounds.
Parr's story was to the effect that
he went to the river to wash some
clothes and arrived there just as a
street car filled with soldiers was pass
ing the house of the woman, who was
being jeered by the soldiers. She
turned into the house, secured a shot
gun, and blazed away in the direction
of the car. His wounds, it was an
nounced, were not serious.

ASK MANY QUESTIONS

Can Guardsmen Be Court

Still Undecided.
New York, July 7. What disposi
tion shall be made of National Guards
men who refuse to take the new oath
of allegiance p'edging themselves to
foreign service, if it is required, has
become too big a problem for the de
partment commanders, it was learned
.last night at headquarters of the De
partment of tho East and'the question
has been placed in tho hands of the
Judge Advocate General at Washing -
ton. It is understood at Governor's
Island that among tho questions the
Judgo Advocato General has been
asked to answer are:
Can tho offender be permitted to
remain a member of the guard per
forming duty at tho homo station or
depot?
Can he bo courtmartialed?
Can ho be drafted for service?
Whichover of these courses is ap
proved by tho Judgo Advocato, it was
said at division headquarters here,
will bo adopted by all department
commanders.
No anxiety is felt about the French
sardine supply as long as herring
continue plentiful along our coast.
It is solemnly promised that the
noble Carranza troops will start out
after-Vilta on Juasjl.

WM BACK
Consolidation of Gains on The
West Occupies Attention
of British.
RUSSIAN VICTORY GREAT
Germans Shift Bulk of De
fenders on Somme to
Face The French..
London, July 7. Violent counter
attacks by the Germans on almost the
entire line of the French advance in
the Somme region, show a change in
the situation from the earlier days of
the Anglo-French offensive.
Meanwhile both French and British
are consolidating their positions and
are undoubtedly making preparations
for a repetition of the great bombard
ment which preceded the first impetu
ous rush.
While the situation in the Verdun
region remains comparatively quiet
there are heavy bombardments on
both sides of thoMeuse. No advances
are recorded by either French or Ger
mans.
The seriousness of the Russian
drive against the Austrians and Ger
mans in the last month is indicated in
reports from Petrograd which say the
Austro-German losses, in the endeavor
to stay the advance of Gen. Brussi
loff's armies, total nearly a half million
men, about half of whom are prison
ers. Not less than 250 guns of various
sizes and more than 700 machine guns
and an immense quantity of other
booty have been taken.
The Austrians admit a serious de
feat west of Kolomea, where thev
were driven back nearly five miles.
Ihe latest official statement from
the Russian war office announces the
capture of approximately 10.000 ad
ditional prisoners, 5,000 of whom are
said to be Germans, taken in a recent
battle on the Dneister. About 5.000
other prisoners were captured on
other sectors of the Russian front.
The Germans admit the withdrawal
of Gen. von Bothmei-'s army in the
Tarnopol sector before the nowcrfu
attacksofthe Russians. They concede
also an advance by the British south
iof Thiepval in the western zone.
Women in War.
High school girls are (locking in
bands to the Russian trenches and
joining the army as private soldiers.
Some have been killed in battle, and
are buried in the flat steppes of Pol
and or on the steep slopes of the Car
pathians. Many have marched off further to
the front, and through changes in
j regimental formation havo been con
pletely lost to their friends at home
who have no clews to their fate. Some
'arc in German internment
of these is Martha Malko, who f -ht
bosido her subaltern husband ui.t 1 he
was killed and she was taken jn. m
or. She is now a prisoner at SJiou
lon. Romarkablc stories come from Rus

standard. They show rare bravery
and nre calm in face of danger.

fighting side by side with men in the
