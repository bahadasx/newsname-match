$10,000 Antl-Lynching Fund
TWO THOUSAND ALREADY PLEDGED
Fifty thousand copies of tho story
of "The WnCo Horror" have Just been
distributed by the National Associa
tion for tho Advancement of Colored
People through its official organ, the
Crisis, and ns a result a campaign for
an antl-lynchlng fund of ten thousand
dollars has been launched. Immedi
ately upon hearing the details of this
American atrocity, which for barbar
ity surpasses anything charged
against the Germans in Belgium,
Judge Moorfleld Storey, National I
President of the American Bar Asso- j
elation, and formerly President of the
American Bar Association, and Mr. :
Philip G. Peabody, both of Boston, '
each offered to contribute $1,000 to-1
ward such a fund on condition that 1
the remaining $S,000 be raised by Au- (
gust 1.
The N. A. A. C. P. sent a special in
vestigator from National headquar
ters at 70 Fifth avenue. New York,
who commenced gathering evidence
In Waco, Texas, where the burlng Oc
curred, within forty-eight hours after
tho lynching, inasmuch as fifteen
thousand people had sanctioned the
affair by their presence and dozens
of pictures were taken, there was no
difficulty j In ascertaining the names
and addresses of the ring-leaders and
the failure of both the judge and
sheriff to make the slightest effort to
protect their prisoner. The Associa
tion v lendlnp every effort to secure
a dlstlngui.iuf, Texas lawyer wttli
courage cnm., to bring the case
against these murderers into court.
Politics, tli littesllgator found, was
at the bottom of the affair. Sam Flem
ing, the sheriff, is up for re-election
at the. Democratic primary in July.
His opponent, Buchanan, though II-
wouldn't choke too soon, and when
those lugging at it broke It, tho driver
of the Annheuser "brewery truck, who
led the rabble, wound It around his
own wrist,- rather than take chances
that the boy should die too soon. Many
had come a long way to attend this
party and they didn't want it to end
in a minute. Everybody was happy;
they shouted and sang like a bunch of
fans aat a ball game, according to a
Wnco paper.
When the boy's clothes had been
cut up and "distributed as souvenirs
there were not enough pieces to go
around, so somebody cut off an ear
for his keepsake. The .Waco Times
Herald published the same afternoon
said, "On the way to the scene of
tho burning people on every hand took
a hand in showing their feelings in
the matter by striking tho negro with
anything obtainable; some struck him
with shovels, bricks, clubs, and others
stabbed him and cut him until when
he was strung up his body was a solid'
color of red, the blood of the many
wounds Inflicted covered him from
head to foot."
They took Washington to a tree on
the City Hall lawn, Just outside the
window of His Honor, tho Mayor,
which he generously shared with Mr.
Gildersleeve, the photographer to
whom we are indebted for our cuts.
A chain was thrown over the limb of
this tree, and while the fire was being
lit, this bloody thing was hoisted into
the air, where everyone would have a
full view. A manicurist who works
for Goldstein and Mingle, whose win
dows look out on the square, told the
Investigator she saw them unsex the
lad. As the chain tightened around,
his neck, this half-dead creature
reached up convulsively to grab It, so
they cut his fingers off.

literate, has "three dead niggers to
his credit," and Is therefore, very pop
ular,' Unless he is to go back to Bell
ing buggies and cultivators for the
hardware store, Sam needed a lynch
ing to increase his popularity. The
murder of Mrs. Fryer on Monday, May
8, came Just at the right time,
Jesse Washington, a colored boy of
seventeen, confessed to both murder
nnd rape. His trial was set for Mon
day, M.ay 15. The crowd began gath
ering from 4he surrounding country
on Sunday. When court opened 1,500
crowded Into the room, Inside the ral.l
about the Judge's desk and Jury box;
and 2,000' more waited in the court
yard.
i The District Judge at the Criminal
Court, R. I, Munroe, elbowed his -way
to his desk; and tho boy was brought
from his chambers where he- had been
secreted since the sheriff brought Ulm
from Dallas in tho middle of the night.
As the Jurors wero called, tho crowd
yelled, "Wo don't need any Jury!" but
trie trial was allowed to bo hurried
through. Tho Jury brought in a ver
dict of guilty of murder and assessed
his punishment aa death. Tho de
. fendant had waived his legal rights
and would have been hanged that
same afternoon. There waa a pauso
of a full minute. Tho court stenogra
pher Bllpped out with his records.
Sheriff Fleming sneaked out, too.
Then a big fellow inthe back of the
ourtroom yelled, "Get the nigger!"
They took him before tho court bad
pronounced Judgment without tho
Judgo lifting; a finger In protest. Down
tho back stairs they rushed him to
the crowd Mlng outside. They put
tho chain In his mouth so' that he
The Waco Times-Herald makes no 1
bones of it. "Fingers, ears, pieces of
clothing, toes, and other patts of the
negro's body were cut off by members
of tho mob that had crowded to the
scene as if by magic when the word
that the, negro had been taken in
charge by .the mob "was heralded over
the city. As the smoke rose to the
heavens, he mass of people, number
ing in the, neighborhood of 10,000,
crowding the City Hall lawn and over
flowing tho square, hanging from the
windows of buildings, viewing the
.scene from the tops of buildings and
trees, set up a shout that was heard
blocks away. Onlookers were hang
ing from the windows pt tho City;
Hall and every other building that
commanded a sight of tho burning,
and as the negro's body commenced
to burn, shouts of delight .went up
from the thousands of throats, nnd npi
parently, everybody demonstratetd in
some way their satisfaction "
Tho body of young Washington was 1
Jurned to a crisp nnd was left for
some time smouldering In tho remains,
of the flro. "Women and children
wh odeslred to view tho scene were!
allowed to do so, tho crowds part
ing to let them look on," says the
newspaper account One father, when
questioned about tho propriety of
holding his llttlo son on his shoulder
whero he could get a good view, is
reported as saying;
"My son can't learn loo young tho I
proper way to treat a nigger,"
At twelve o'clock the crowd ad-'
Journed for lunch, as usual; but by
a quarter past one some of the boys
were back to continue the fun. A
cowboy who had ridden in off the
range created a diversion by lassoing
tho corpse and riding all over town 1
with the remains dangling at the end I
of his lariat. When the head bounced I
off as ho galloped through the "reser-1
vatlon," the ghetto where the Negroes i
and prostitutes are segregatted, some .
little boys set it up on one of the !
doorsteps and extracted the" loose
teeth, which are reported o have
brought as high as five dollars apiece '
from those who could afford such rare
and permanent souvenirs. The few '
fragments which held together till 1
night, the undertaker was able to ,
chuck Into a very small ash can. !
Waco is a center of American cul-.l
ture In Texas, a great Southern col-'
lege town. It is a Christian city of j
40,000 population, boasting thirty-nine J
white and twenty-four colored church
es. Yet no responsible plco was '
raised in protest that bloody Monday,
and only one has been since. !
Those who believe that a cry to 1
Heaven should be raised against this
and every lynching, by legal prosecu-
tlon, by publicity, by co-operation with
the best white element of the South,
by political agitation, are. urged to as
