The threats made by members of
tho Connery Gang to put Tlio Eaglo
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
tho ConncryB have on public affairs.
The result Is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can uso tho United States Gov
ernment In their business.
They evidently havo found the
Stnto of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions.
Democrats in Chlcugo are wonder
ing why all of tho public Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be duo to tho fact that thoro
are not enough Connorys to go around.
Conncrys First!
What a noble family motto that is
to bo sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for tho Connorys and their well
known hankering for good things.

next year, so prepare your bal

of other contracts In which tho Con
nery connections woro alleged to havo
boon Interested nro not so far forgot
ten that tho public interest in them
ovor wholly died out.
Thoro was a number of talontod
Democratic loaders who held offlco or
contracts under tho Dusso BUSINESS
administration.
Wo havo referred to somo of these
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1907 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many in
the light of the Royal Family of the
Domocratlo party, entitled to most,
if not to all, of the Jobs in its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to havo worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
groat.
When John W. Rainey, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of tho Circuit Court
In 1912, tho Connory outfit fought
him at tho polls In favor of Joseph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robort M. Sweltzer was run
ning for tho Domocratlo nomination
for Mayor In 1915, tho Connorys saw
anothor chanco to put a member ot the
family In that offlco and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But tha Domocratlo stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet of Connery and tho noblo Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
wait for another chance,
Sweltzer. got tho nomination and It
is said that tho Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
ono of tho princes of the blood and
were not over-enthuslastie for Sweit
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid

The principal charge brought
against two of the Democratio county

is that they are swell headed.
This is a bad year for swell heads.
Party workers may be Induced

But the voters will not re-elect

REPUBLICAN CON
VENTION JULY II
A Republican county convention
with 4,454 delegates lins been called
to meet Tuesday, Jdly 11, for tho pur
poso ot selecting candidates for elev
en county positions and ten positions
tf-jL
on tho municipal bench, to bo voted
on at tho statowldo primaries Sept.
13.
Tho action does not mean that there
Is harmony in the Republican ranks.
On the contrary, tho indications are
that tho county committeemen are as
far removed from a peace agreement
as they over were. No answer has
been recoivod from tho Deneen group
ot committeemen as to whether or
not they will accept tho compromise
offer made by tho Brundage and
Thompson groups ot committeemen
whereby Mr. Deneen was to be con
ceded approximately one-fourth of the
county and municipal bench nomina
tions. The committee went .ahead on
the belief that there would bo no ac
ceptance from the Deneen people and
that the only alternative was to hold
a convention.

WILSON WILL
Threatened Betrayal by Chicago Contract
Hunters Who Forage in Both Parties
for Coin Won't Hurt Him.
President Wilson is In no danger
ot defeat becausa ot tho hidden and
underhanded attacks being made
upon his candidacy by the Chicago
High Binders.
Tho President talzed this crowd up
from tho start of his administration
und, although outwardly pretending
to be with him for re-election, this
crowd of political traders aro trying
to cut his political heart out.
The voters know the truth about
this gang.
They know that tho only Democ
racy Its members possets Is wrapped
up la a small package and used to
grease their own Itchy palms and to
secure tho plums for themselves.
They havo secured no plums from
Wilson.
Tho President is too great and too
good a man to stand for a moment
for gang rulo in politics.
That is why tho people aro with
him.
Tho Order ot Democrats for Reve
nue Only, who aro organizing against
Wilson in Chicago, are paving the
way for another knockout for them
selves. But they will go along In tholr usu
al way.
They will try to beat him by under
handed methods until election day.
Then if he wins they will say that
they elected him.
It Wilson loses they will be sitting
on Hughes' doorstep and may ask him
to make ono of their gang his prlvato
secretary.
The voters love them so well that
whoever they are for loses; whoever
they are against wins.
CAN'T TIE THE
C0NNERYS
Bemis Family Not Slow, but No
where in Comparison with
Connerys.
Investigation of the books of tho
Peoples' Gas Light and Coke Com
pany is going to be an expensive
preposition for tho city ot Chlcugo.
Edward W. Bumls, expert retained
by tho council committee on gas lltl
satlon for $100 n day, cheerfully sub
mitted a list ot umploycs ho wants to
aid him In his work.
Bomls thinks ho ought to huvo a
staff of fifty-five ausltauts, and a. corps
of messengers and stenographers In
addition.
Ills estimate of tho number of as
sistants ho needs calls for an expendi
ture ot approximately $7,000 a month,
exclusive of his own salary.
What Is more, Bemls Is working
also for the committee on gas, oil and
electric light, also at tho rato ot $100
a day. Of course, he Is not supposed
to clmrgo ench commltteo $100 for tho
suine day's work.
Bomls has his son on the pay roll
of tho gas, oil and electric light com
mltteo at a salary of $20 a day. Ho
tried to put him on tho pay roll ot tho
gas litigation commltteo also, but
Alderman I. aw I or, chairman of that
committee, decided that would bo too
much of a good thing for father and
sou, exports though thoy nro reputed
to bo, und ho refused to upprovo tho
pay roll.
Hero Is tho brigade Demla proposes
to put to work for tho gas litigation
committee:
Seven department engineers at $225
to $250 a month.
Fivo assistant engtneors at $200 a
month.
Five assistant engineers at $100 a
month.
Eight Junior engineers at $12G to
$145 a month.
Two draftsmen at $90 to $100 a
month.
Threo cost analylsts at $90 to $110
a month. -,
Two Junior clerks at $70 to $100 a
month.
Two Inspectors at $70 to $100 u
month.
One senior clerk at $140 a month.
Twenty Hold assistants at $70 fo
$125 a month.
The forco Is supposed to prepare
data for tho trial of tho city's suit to
enforce the gas rato ordlnanco passed
fivo years ago.
Bemls' request was referred to tho
efficiency staff of tho finance commit
too for Investigation.
BUT HOLD ON TO
PUBLJCPAYROLLS
Members of the Connery Gang
Who Lose Their Popularity
and Are Driven Out by Demo
crats of Other Wards, Said to
Save Their Big Salaries by
Watching the Sad Waves from
Roosts Near the "Beach."
Tho Connorys, through "hogging
tha Jobs" and for other good und suf
ficient ion sons, lmvo lost all tho po
litical popularity they ovor possessed,
according to rumor.
Francis n. Connory, tho former City
Clerk, with a Record, and prcsonl
$0,000 a yoar Comptroller ot tho Sani
tary District of Chicago, rnn against
Frank Paschen, a well known busi
ness man, for Democratic Ward Com
mlteomnn of tho 28th ward.
I'uschon defeated Connory by ovor
3,000 votes.
Connory has Joined several .other
Connorys, who draw good public sal
aries, In tho Edgewater Observation
Camp,, whero they can hear tho mur
mur of moro knocks to como from tho
sad, sobbing waves at tho "Beach,"
and think ot the good old days of
"Fire Appliancos."
But they never quit tho public pay
roll.
The Connory who Is now Recordor
ot floods had a narrow escape from
missing tho election when ho ran tour
years ago for his present $9,000 a yoar
Job. If ho has gained in popularity
since many do not bollevo it.
WIN
The run he made in 1912 was ono ot
the poorest ever put up by any candi
date for ofllco in Cook County undir
the circumstances.
Although tho Republican party was
split In two ho only nosed out tho
Progressive candidate, nn almost un
known man In politics, by a llttlo over
22,000 votes.
If tho Republican cnndldnto had
received n fourth of tho Progressive
vote Connery would havo been loft In
tho cemetery. Tho Republican and
Progressive vote added together beat
Connery over 90,000 votes.
Connery In tho opinion of many will
bo tho worst beaten man on tho ticket
this year becauso tho voters will havo
a chance to take a straight crack at
him.
Tho vote tor Recorder In 1012 as
officially announced wns as follows:
Connery, Democrat 139,370
Cnnnon, Ropubllcnn 117,784
Willis, Progressive 110,100
McMnhon, Socialist G9,531
Tho Socialists polled almost half as
many votes us were cast for Connery
In a presidential year.
Tho combined Republican, Progres
sive and Socialist majority ovor Con
nery In 1912 wns over 154,000 votoH.
Connery spells defeat.
