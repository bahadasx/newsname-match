Mr. Arredondo transmitted to his

note handed to him by Secretary L;in
sing, expressing gratification over the
turn affairs between the two gov
ernments have taken, and accepting
proposals for diplomatic settlements
of points in dispute The communica
tion was approved by tlio Cabinet.
Officials did not fail to note that Sec.
retary Lansing had laid stress upon
the desirability of giving quick and
practical consideration to the imme
diate conditions along the border,
which have been a source of contro
versy. The language "f the commu
nication plainly intimate that a
speedy solution of that problem will be
sought.
NEGOTIATIONS \ Wtltou ED
TO TWO I'll I> TS AT Issi K
The definition of the bolder dispute
submitted by General Carranza :n his
note suggesting negotiations for a se\
tlement apparentl> has been found ac
ceptable bv the Washington govern
ment. This virtually narrows the im
mediate object of the negotiations to
consideration of th< "reasonable anx
iety of the t"nlt?-d State;; f..r tlu- secur
ity of Its froi.t..?!?. an<( the de.-lre of
the de facto governrncr.' f*>r early
withdrawal f Amor: :i:i troops from
Mexico."
Additional <-\.<!? i;? <? ??{ ti ?? u> re
friendly attitude of the Carranza gov
ernment came to-day in the form of a
?warning communicated by Mr. Arre
dondo to the State Department, at the
direction of General Carranza in con
nection with the battle between Villa
and Carranza forces at <""orralltos The
message admitted a serious defeat for
the Carranza troops, and asked that
the American troop.- exercise unusual
vigilance along the border, particu
larly in the Big Bend region in Texas
as there was reason to believe the ban
dits were headed that way to precip
itate a new border incident. The mes
sage was promptly forwarded to Gen
eral Funston as a matter of informa
tion.
AMERICAN ItKI'OIITS
\ ii.i. v has iti:< o\kiik11
At the same time the State Depart
ment received a report from an Amer
ican in Mexico that lie had seen and
talked with Villa personally near Cor
ralltos a few days before the fight
there. The bandit loader was said to
have entirely recovered from wounds
received at Colombo:
This message, the source of which
was not revealed, added that Villa had
been continuously in the Corralitos re
gion since the American pursuit was
halted by the clash at I'arral. the first
outbreak of hostility against General
Pershing's expedition by Carranza sol
diers. The detachment of American
cavalry assailed while at tempt inir to
pass through Parral was on its way to
Corralltos at the time, it is understood,
following a clue as to the bandits' hid
ing place.
If Villa is alive, and has recovered
sufficiently to lead a new force toward
the border, considerable detachments
of Carranza troops are between his
present position and the most advanced
American patrols. There will be nn
possibility of American troops becom
ing Involved for many days, as it Is
a long march from Corralltos to the
Big Bend region.
Officials were pleased at the indica
tion that General Carranza was dis
posed to seek co-operation in protect
ing the border.
NO COMPT<I<<TK WITHDIlAIV Al<
TJNDF.Il EXISTING CONDITIONS
They saw In the warning, however,
a frank admission that bandits still
are active in considerable forces in
the territory over which the de facto
government repeatedly has claimed
complete military control. That a
force large enough to overwhelm a
body of regular Mexican troops should
have been able to t?<ke the field may
have an Important bearing on the
forthcoming diplomatic discussions of
the whole border situation. It seems
certain that the Washington govern
ment will not agree to the complete
withdrawal of its forces from Mexico
while such conditions obtain .there.
Mr. Arredondo reiterated to-night his
belief that Villa is dead.

which dates from ttie last session of
the General Assembly. It culminated
this week \sith the launching1 of
charges against Examiner Kaslev by
Attorney Benjamin Watkins Leigh, of
Houston, who told the Tax Board that
Mr Kasley has been negligent in tlx8
administration of his "Mice, and has
failed to report for taxation large
sums of money in the hands of spe

causes Th< charges were vigorously
denieil by Mr. Kaslev.
lti behalf of Mr Watkins there was
presented to the Tax Board a monster
petition signed by m??re than
1 ltizcns of the Sixth Circuit, including
all of the State Senators and all but
two of the members of the House of
Delegates from that circuit. Mg Wat

Kate last night Mr Kasley made the

and proven untrue, with the exception
of my failure to report some of the

of these funds the imperative duty of

funds were omitted by all the ex

Allies in Mighty Drive
Against German Lines
on Opposite Fronts
Double Offensive by British
and Russian Armies Cre
ates Serious Problem for
Kaiser's Strategists.
LONDON, July 7.?British and Rus
sian armies, striking simultaneously on
the western and eastern fronts, to-day
made further dents in the German lines
and created what military critics be
lieved to he the greatest problem yet i
faced l>y the German general staff.
For the first time during the war,!
Germany has been called upon to meet
a determined double offensive on op
posite fronts, and the German tac
ticians must now determine how to
| meet the new co-ordinated strategy of
the entente allies and how best to
j utilize Germany's available military re
i sources.
General Haig's army to-day gained
several important successes. It cap
tured positions in the immensely im
portant portion known .is the Leipzig
? redoubt, while east of l.a Boiselle they
I captured German trenches on a front
! of nearly 2,0n?i yards to a depth of T>00
. yards. They also forced their way Into
! the village of Ovillers, after captur
| ing 500 yards of the German front,
i while north of Kricourt they drove the
' enemy from two woods and captured
\ three lines of trenches.
General Kvert's Russian army is at
, tacking on a 100-mile front, running
approximately from the. Vilna line
; north to Baranovichi, in the south.
! The seriousness of tHo crisis is re
I fleeted in the paucity of information
given the German public in Berlin's
official bulletins, which, however, at last
: admit the loss of Hem and Bulloy, on
i the western front.
itrssiws Mi-'.i'oirr
st < t i>> aktkh st'cruss
There is no continuation of the re
port from FJonie that the whole German
| line on the eastern front is retiring,
i but the Russians continue to report
J success after success.
The latest official statement issued by
I Berlin admits a retirement from a
| salient in the f'/artorysk region, and
the Russian statement to-night an
nounces that Russian cavalry has cap
tured .M.imevit. hie, which is only some
fifty miles from Kovel.
Clearly, the Russiati offensive towards
Baranovichi. Kovel and I.emberg, added
to the collapse of the Austrians.
greatly endangers the whole German
line:.. Heavy fighting is continuing
along ilu whole line, and the Russians
are addinu ti? their captures of pris
oners and honty hourly. Prisoners cap
tured by the Russians during the past
few days number nearly '20,000.
The Knglish official statement of to
? night, announcing results of to-day's
, lighting, said that the Herman casual
lies dining thi" day must have been very
; severe. Large numbers of troops, re
' tsrinrr over the open, were caught by
aitillery tire, and the village of Mazen
tin-le-l'etit was heavily shelled at a
time when it was seen to be full of
German reserves.
Little is known of (lie casualties
suffered by the Rritish either in to
i day's fighting or previous drives of the
: present movement. The first list was
published to-night, and names over '200
officers, of whom twenty-five were
killed. It, says 1,7.10 men were killed
or wounded. Among those killed was
Colonel Robert Jeffray Douglas.
QlfKSTION OK A>1 MUNITION
A NSW 1CU101) nv K KM.A WAV
The quest Ion whether Great Britain
will be ablo to maintain an adequate
supply of ammunition at the present
rate of wantage received an answer, In
part, to-day from Frederick G. Kella
way, M. P., secretary to Dr. Christopher
f ' -
I'-- ' :v.
Addison, who. next to David Lloyd'
George, is the most important ottlclal j
in the Ministry of Munitions. Mr.
Kellaway says:
"We are not yet at the full flood of;
our output of nuns and shells. If the
Germans cannot be driven home other
wise. our army shall have such u
supply of guns that the limbers shall
touch each other In a continuous :line
from the Somme to the sea."
He added that ninety new arsenals
had been provided, and that -10,000 con-j
trolled tiims are producing munitions.
The total number of munition workers
in 1014. he said, was under 2,000.000,
and there now are 3,500,000. The labor
problem, Mr. Kellaway asserted, has
been. to a large extent, solved by the
women. Before the war 1S4.000 women
were engaged in war Industries. There!
arc now yn encjaped.
Much interest is attached to the new1
Uusso-.lapanose treaty, which, accord-!
lug to .in authoritative Japanese source
here, effectively dispels any hope Ger- i
many may have held of seducing any j
member of the entente alliance, and it
[is the strongest possible reply to the
numerous offers which have been made
to both Japan and Russia with a view
to In ingitis; about a separate peace.

curtllng to Paris.
For the first time since the war
began. Germany is facing enormous
drives on two fronts?the west and
ease.
The British have resumed their of
fensive in the Somme sector, while the
Russians are hurling vast forces
against the Teutonic line, over a 300
niile front from Riga to Baranovichi.
?tains for the allies on both fronts
are chronicled in the latest official
statements. After a day of terrific
fighting, the British carried trenches
at three points along the front, while
the Russians also took three important
points.
The British gains, while not result
ing in any substantial advance, are
characterized by the War Office as im
portant from a tactical viewpoint.
On the othrtr hand, military critics of
the entente allies assert that, unless the
Germans can halt the Russian advance
in the Immediate future, they will have
to withdraw their lines on .the entire
eastern front, and probably abandon
Lemberg. ? :
The violence of the British offensive
on Friday failed, however, to divert the
attention of the Germans from their
desperate efforts to capture Verdun.
Assault after assavR was delivered in
the Thiaumont region. but, according
I to Paris, all were in vain.
< >n the French end of the Sommo sec
tor there was a lull In the fighting.
The Italia lis claim continued progress
for their offensive against the Aus
trians in t lie Trentlno district, but
there apiyirently has been no great
change in this field of the war.
