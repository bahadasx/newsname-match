Instructs Gen. Gaston to Take

WARNED BY DE FACTO GOV'T
Army Officers Believe Brigands
Bonnd for Durango.
Say Villa Doesn't Dare to Strike
Border Blow Now.
San Antonio, Tex. July 8. For
more than two hundred miles east
ward from EI Paso American troops
were being held in readiness today to
move to any point on the border that
might be threatened by the newly or
ganized bandits in Chihuahua. To the
west of El Paso an alert watch for de
velopments south of the line was kept
and officers commanding at all border
stations were prepared for news of
advancing raiders.
Early morning reports to General
Funaton added nothing, however, to
the rumors of yesterday, most impor
tant of which was the warning from
the de facto government of Mexico,
itself, that bandits who defeated, Car
ranza's soldiers near Jiminez were
thought to be moving northward to
wards OJinago, opposite Presidio,
Texas.
Guard Big Bend Region.
Colonel Gaston, commanding the
American forces in the Big Bend dis
trict, was authorized by General -Fun-Bton
to make such disposition of his
troops as he deemed wise to present
Mexican bandits crossing the river. He
has at Presidio and at stations east
and west of Presidio a considerable
force, Including the Sixth cavalry, his
own regiment, and the Fourth in
fantry. Although taking all precautions and
not minimizing the reports that Villa,
himself, is at the head of the new
organization of bandits, army officers
today were not inclined' to beiieve the
bandits would attempt any movement
in force towards the north, especially
iC-ied by Villa. The opinion -of army
otficers generally was that the ban
dits would confine their activity for a
time in harrassing the Carranza troop
south of Chihuahua and move north
and west towards Durango and south
ward to Chihuahua, old haunts of
Villa.
Houn Dog Regiment Arrives.
Fort "Worth. Tex., July 8. The Sec
ond Missouri infantry has officially
adopted the famous "Houn Doj,'" song
as the battle hymn of the regiment.
To make it an illustrated song, they've
acquired the mournf ullest long-eared-
est Missouri hound ever seen in these
parts as a mascot.
Curranza's Army Can't Stop Them!
El Paso, Tex., July g. Villistas are
rushing toward the Big Bend country
to raid American towns, according to
information received here todav.
Sweeping across the Chihuahua
waster, from Falomir, toward La
Mula Pass, a band of Villistas of un
known ntrenf-th is reported to be
moving toward OJlnaga and the small
American settlements in the Big Ber.d
border country.
The bandits are belii vod to be t!e
same of whom Carranza warned Sec
retary Lansing. Carranza intimated
that his troops may not be able to
prevent the raiders striking the
American towns
Many Small Bands Join.
The Villistas left Faiomir yesterday.
The band is being joined by smaller
groups that have been operating in
that section. Many Carranza deserters
are reported to have Joined the raid
ers. According to the reports re
reived here, the Villistas are well
armed, have plenty of ammunition and
are well mounted.
Apparently by pre-concert, the Vil
lista hands gathered at Falomir for
the movement northward toward La
Mula pass. Other small bands are
known to be at Pieachas, Las Vesas
and alon the southern slopes of the
Sierra Grandes. It is believed these
mountain groups will reinforce the
raiders at the pass.

PEOPLE SAVE
BIG MONEY IN
NEWCITY PLAN
Commissioner Wasson Shows
How $5,000 Gain Is Made.
Four Hundred Citizens Happy
With Safe Investments.
BOND SALE A GREAT SUCCESS
Topekans Are Able to Keep
Their Money at Home.
Clear Statement Concerning
Sale of Municipal Bonds.
The immense success of selling the
city bonds by the method suggested
by Commissioner Wasson and the
State Journal came to fruition today
when the eale actually began this
morning.
The bonds were over subscribed
three times so the commission was
unable to supply anything like the
demand.
Now over four hundred people will
have investments in our own Topeka
borda in amounts of $100 and up
wards an average of about $500 to
the person! Think of this and at a
saving to our people of $5,000.
Don't believe any printed or verbal
reports to the contrary for they are
not true and misrepresent the com-
I missioners, the city and the facts.
Figures submitted by W. H. Wasson,
I finance commissioner, show that by
handling the new bond issue itself the
city is saving the citizens of Topeka
$5,000, perhaps more. For, had the
banks been given the bonds, the
"small investors" would have had to
pay the banks a premium. I
Keeping Money at Home. j
Today Mr. Wasson made the fol
lowing statement in answer to the
banks:
"The proposition of the banks was
not bona-fide in that the offer to buy
the bonds at a $2,000 premium was
made only after every bond had been
sold. It was a case of 'sour grapes.'
"The commissioners did receive a be
lated proposition from two banks, the;
German-American State bank and the
State Savings bank, and one bonding
company, Spitzer, Korick & Co., the
latter of New York., One of the pro
positions was accompanied by a check
of $1,000, another, was very similar
j and offered the same premium on
I $1,000 and the State Savings bank of
1 fered 4-10 of 1 per cent or $440 on
: $100,000.
Order of Commissioners.
I "The matter was brought before the
: commission and that body decided in
i asmuch as the bonds had been al-
ready sold in good faith to citizens of
Topeka it would not break faith with
! our citizens, and of course ordered
' the clerk to return the checks re
ceived find notify the bidders of the
j action taken by the commission.
I Pay Extra Premium.
! "Had these bonds been sold at a
premium they would have been sent
out of the city and away from our
people or else our people would have
had to pay the extra premium paid
by the bond brokers and would in
Addition thereto have had to pay the
bond brokers' commission, whatever
that might have been.
! "It is not fair to our citizens and un
' necessary' too, to be compelled to pay
, bond brokers the commission on the
t very bonds the citizens have to pay.
' "Many of these people buying bonds
are having pavnig done adjoining their
property. The city turned back the
premiums in order to keep Its pledge
with the Tope-kans who bought the
bonds in good faith. It seems no one
should have just cause to urge that
the citizens should not have the privi
lege of buying the bonds direct. The
bankers who offered the premiums
knew before the offer was made they
would not get the securities; that they
were sold."
A day or two before the banks
wrote their letters making the offer
for the bonds, Roy Bone, vice presi
dent of the German-American State
bank, and William Macferran, presi
dent of the State Savings bank, held a
conference in Mr. Macferran's office.
The actual sale of these paving im
provement bonds of $234,413.75 began
today. The bonds were returned from
the state house, where they had been
recorded, today.
Scores of people were in the office
of W. H. Wasson, finance commission
er, this morning after the securities.
The buyers had only one complaint.
They were unable, in many cases, to
obtain as many of the bonds as they
wanted. Most of the buyers this
morning were women.
Three Million Bonds Invalid.
Jefferson City, Mo., July 8. The
$3,000,000 road bond issue of St. Louis
county was declared Invalid by the
supreme court today, which refused to
issue an order requiring the state au
ditor to register the bonds.

Kansas Guardsman Writes of
Conditions on Border.
More Peaceful There Than in
Topeka, He Says.
WAR TALK COMES FROM NORTH
Greasers - Flock Across Line
Praying for "Chow."
Hot and Dry and No Rain for
Fourteen Months.
According to Sergt. Howard I
Ward, one of the Oakland members in
the Second Kansas Infantry band, now
with the contingent of Kansas troops
at Eagle Pass. Texas, there is more
talk about war with Mexico In Kansas
than there is along the border, or, at
any rate, along that part of the bor
der where Kansas soldiers are station
ed. More than that, the Mexicans in
the vicinity of the Kansas soldiers are
in anything but a hostile mood towards
Americans. They don't want to fight,
says i Sergeant Ward, they want to eat.
These observations were made by
Sergeant Ward in a letter to his home
folk that was written at Eagle Pass
on July 4, the day after the Second
Kansas infantry arrived there. Ex
cerpts for his letter that may be
interesting follow:
"We arrived at' Eagle Pass yester
day at noon and have things about all
now' so that we can live as com
fortably as possible.
Hot and Dry.
Tv,'?ly' b,Ut " ,s hot and dry here.
The regulars who have been stationed
? ?n? time decWe for the
truth that it hasn't rained here for
fourteen months. But it does happen
to get cool at night, and there is that
much for which to be thankful. How
ever, there isn't anything that looks
like a shade tree here to get under
in the day time. In fact, there isn't
anything that looks like vegetation
here except a prickly bush, one that
has thorns all over it. We rode ail
forenoon yesterday through this kind
of a country,- with not a house in
night, and everywhere along the road
you could see cattle that had dropped
dewn and died for want of water. "
"When the Second regiment march
ed tn to camp, one of two men, resi
dents of Eagle Pass, who were stand
ing toy and watching us, remarked to
his companion:
Easterners Are Tender. "
" 'Look at that husky bunch.' "
"I talked with them afterwards,
and-they told me that the eastern na
tional guardsmen, who are already
here and had come from New York,
Connecticut and Massachusetts, ar
rived with overcoats and heavy under
wear on, and that they all looked like
a lot of delicate boys with their white
skin. I'll bet it will go hard with them
for a while.
"We have the only band in the
camp, but this sand and dust will
ruin our instruments in a short time.
It will cut all of their valves out.
. Sand Storm Every Night.
"Every night at 6 o'clock, we have
' a sand storm here and it lasts for an
hour. And the dust and the sand
certainly fly. They say It is caused
i by the tide in the gulf.
I "The Mexicans are coming across
tne line in crowds, and are half
starved. They are feeding them at
Eagle Pass.
"All the stories you hear about
their treachery and the killing they
do along the border must be 'bunk.'
The poor devils don't want to fight.
They want something to eat.
"Yesterday one of them tried to
cross the river from the Mexican side,
and when he got across the guard let
him rest for a few minutes and then
started him back. He rubbed his stom
ach and said: 'No chow.' He was
hungry. "
Gnna Trained on Mexico.
"All around the camp on the hills
they have field guns entrenched and
trained on Mexico, and as the gunners
are on the Job night and day, there is
no chance of the Mexicans ever getting
across if they should make the effort.
f'It is Just as peaceable here as It is
in Kansas, and you don't hear of half
as much killing by the Mexicans here
or war talk either, as you do in Kan-
LAD HANDS OVER ROLL
Proves It Isn't Counterfeit But "Offi

Kansas City, Mo., July 8. "Say,
young fellow, you're the man . who's
been passing all this oum money to
saloons around here," declared the
stranger as he approached Fred Jack
son, Just in from Keetsville.
"I've got you," he added.
Jackson retreated to the wall of a
building and denied the stranger's ac
cusation. "Come, now," the stranger contin
ued. "You know you did it I'm an
officer. Let me see your money and
I'll soon find out."
Jackson handed over tlS In bills.
The man looked at them a moment.
"Yep," he concluded, "this is the
money all right," and then he placed
the bills in his pocket ard walked
away.

San Antonio, Tex.. July 8. Army
officials here believe a single factor
will render useless the attempts to
adjust the difference between the
United States and Mexico by diplo

Pancho Villa, who apparently has re
sumed his bandit operations on a
larger scale than at any time since his

forces nearly a year ago.

SYMPTOMS ' AND TREATMENT INFANTILE
PARALYSIS, NOW EPIDEMIC IN NEW YORK
SYMPTOMS Infantile paralysis starts with a cold. : which usually
takes the form of a running nose and frequently sore throat. Often
a slight fever and stomach trouble accompany the cold.
Ninety per cent, of the cases in the New York city, epidemic are
. children under the school age, but adults are not immune. . .
The patient will complain of weakness. A slow paralysis will follow,
affecting at first the arms and legs and possibly one side.
After two weeks the paralyzed parts will begin to waste away,
while the stiffness gradually diminishes.
, -TREATMENT. The instant a child is suspected of having the dis
ease, a doctor should be called.
. The patient should be completely isolated. .
The limbs and parts of the body affected should be given absolute
rest. Paralyzed arms and legs must be bolstered up with - pillows and
the weight of clothing kept from them by means of hoops or some such
device.
After the paralysis leaves the limbs, the most important curative
measure is massage and training of muscles affected.
The contagious period lasts twenty-eight days, during which the
strictest caution must be observed against spreading the disease.
Only one person in addition to a physician should take care of the
child, and the nurse and doctor should wear special garments for sick
room attendance.

Villa to Chihuahua City. .
El Paso. Tex.. July S. Villa is re
ported " f .uay. . to . be marching from
Jiminez. to Chihuahiia'Oity. while con
tradictory advices from Carranza
sources declared the de facto govern
men troops had- re-occupied Jiminez
and were driving the bandits south
ward. Carranza officials do. not admit
that Villa himself is leading the rebels.
-The Villa leaders have issued new
Mexican currency. Millions of the
bandit leader's old currency is held
throughout Chihuahua and he is re
ported to be obtaining much support
by promising to redeem the now prac
tically worthless paper. Former Vll
listis in small ' Carranza garrisons of
southern Chihuahua are reported to
have rejoined their old leader. The
idol of the peons in northern Mexico,
Villa, in reports which declare he is
alive, is said to be recruiting a strong
force to overthrow Carranza and drive
out the gringo soldiers.
He is paying hi., soldiers and buy
ing proviEions with the new issue of
currency according to unofficial
sources. The rebels have confiscated
ammunition and . guns . found in the
small hamlets and also have obtained
arms from Carranza deserters, vic

from mountain caches. - . .. .

May Be Disappointed, Though,
About Withdrawal,
Mexico City. July 8. That Secre
tary Landing has pledged' the' with
drawal of American troops from Mex
ico in his inswer to the Mexican note
is the popular belief here.
The people are awaiting expectantly
for the contents of the note. It is the
general impression- that the United
States abandons the' idea of Interven

gotiate future difficulties.
The American reply, which merely
expressed a willingness to continue the
negotiations, evidently has not been
made public in Carranza's -capital.
There is great satisfaction over the re
ports that Mexico and - the - United
States will reach both a peaceful and
practical solution of their difficulties.
Sentiment has undergone a marked
change and it is quite likely that dem
onstrations and parades to show
friendly feeling for the United States
will be held tomorrow. . .

After Repeated Assaults French
Masters at Belloy.
Berlin, via London. July 8. Today's
news from the western front throws
little light on the fighting during the
last twenty-four hours but the advices
show that the fighting in the period
immediately preceding was most in
tense at these points, at Thiepval
around Hem and the region right to
ten miles south of the Somme river.
In the Thiepval sector there was a
succession' of bitter attacks and coun
ter attacks..: The British several times
succeeded -by. , violent assaults In ob
taining , a foothold in Thiepval, but
each time were ejected from the ruins
of the village. ' Their losses are .de
scribed as "extraordinarily heavy.",.
The only British succas, and this Is
declared to be unimportant, was the
capture of a salient ; of German
trenches east of La Boisseile,. only a
short distance east , of the - original
German line. From . La Boisselle
southward the fighting was of a locai
character. . , , .
The Germans have thrown a strong
dam around the French floodwave and
have repulsed all attempts to break
the dam.
Take Hem After Three Assaults.
The capture of trte village of Hem
was accomplished by the French only
after three desperate attempts. The
first two onslaughts, although deliv
ered with great force nd oetermina
tion, were repulsed. The third assault
gave them possession of the village
and enabled them to straignten their
line between Curlu and Feuilleres.
The fighting at Estrees and Bellow-en-Santerre
also was of a house-to-house
and hand-to-hand character.
The wave of battle wept- back and
forth with both Frencl and Germans
resorting chiefly to th use of the bay
onet and hand grenades and fighting
with the utmost desperation. The
losses, as to be expected in this sort
of fighting, were very heavy. The
French finally remained masters of
Belloy.
The German commanders have pre
pared for attempts by the French or
British to extend the front of the of
fensive or for a renewed ' attack at
new places on the long front but as yet
no serious endeavor m this direction
ha been reported. -

London, July 8. The super-offensive
of the allies' armies entered its
second week today with the allies
everywhere attacking and maintaining
their early gains at practically every
point, despite heavy enemy counter at
tacks. A heavy, downpour of .rain
throughout -yesterday afternoon con
verted the battle ground on both sides
of the Somme in, a great sea of mud
last night and seriously . hampered
operations. Despite this handicap the
French war office today claimed
slight further progress south . of the
Somme with the taking of 400 prison
ers. General Haig reported that in the
last few days the British have cap
tured twenty guns, fifty-one machine
guns, numerous mine throwers and
other war material.
Germans' Loss, 30,000 Killed.
The British troops north of the
Somme, after scoring important suc
cesses against the Germans in yes
terday's fighting, contented them
selves last night with improving their
positions. The fighting at the village
of Contalmaison reached a deadlock
during the night with the British
holding the western and the Germans
the eastern part of the ruined town.
No official estimates of either the
German or British losses have been
made by the war office since the of
fensive began at 7:30 last Saturday
morning, but . the Germans are un
officially reported to have lost from
80,000 to 40,000 in killed and wound
