VOTE LIGHT BONDS
Groat Demonstration Followed
Winning of Municipal Plant
Fight at Marshall.
WAS DEFEATED THREE TIMES
Citizens Indulged In Torchlight Parade
and Speeches When the Result
Became Known.
After a E-year ramna'gn Marshall
has decided to have a' municipal elec
tric lighting plant. By a majority of
seventy-seven the city recently voted
bonds calling for $75,000 for tho es
tablishment of a plant to bo operated
lu connection with tho present muni
cipally owned water works. There
wero 4G7 votes cast for tho bonds and
390 against.
There was a great demonstration
when it was known that the bonds
had been voted. Enthusiasts organ
ized a torchlight parado and marched
around tho city square to the blowing
of whistles and the tooting of motor
car horns. Later a stand was erected
In the center ot tho squaro and those
who had taken an active part in tho
campaign for municipal ownership
were callod upon for speeches.
Tho recent election was the fourth,
tho Issue having been defeated threo
times previously. Tho present light
plant of Marshall is owned by tho
Missouri Gas and Electric Service
Company. Tho now plant Is to be one
third larger than tho present one.
There will bo twice as many street
lights throughout tho city. Tho con
sumer will be charged a vate of eight

died of apoplexy at the wheel of his
motor car recently whllo driving
from "Camp Clark to Nevada. Major
Williams was about 40 years old and
recently had married. He was mus
tered Into tho regular service recent
ly and as a result his widow will
reccivo $1,500 which is six months'
pay for an officer of his rank. Mrs.
Williams would have received noth
ing had he delayed action. Overwork
due to the national guard mobiliza
tion is believed to have hastened his
death, tho second in tho history ot
the Missouri militia camp. Sergeant
Major Miller was killed In his tent by
lightning at Lake Contrary in 1907.

counties of the stato by voting a rock
road bond issue of IVi million dollaro
to bo expended in constructing a
county-wido system, 202 miles lu all,
of 365-day-in-tho-year roads.
The victory was unexpeeud. Not
until Into in tho day did it becomo ap
parent that the splendid work of the
county rock road committee and tho
other permanent road boosters had
been so well done that tho tide of op
position had turned into a wavo of
victory.
Tho total vote cast was C.2S0. In
favor of the bond Issuo 3,700 ballots
wero registered, while tho voto
against tho bonds was 1,580. Under
the law a two-thirds vote Is required
to carry bonds and the affirmative
voto was 180 In excess of the two
thirds. While tho vote for good roads was
heavier in tho rural precincts than
tho rock road men had dared to hope,
the credit for the victory must be
given to Excelsior Springs and North
Kansas City. In those two towns the
verdict In favor of progress was to
largo that It might bo called unani
mous. In North Kansas City the rock
road ballot overshadowed tho nega
tive ballots 27 to 1, whllo in Excelsior
Springs It was 7 to 1. ,
In tho Liberty precincts, whero

Mr. Farls hoped while In Kansas
City recently to he able to personally
invito Billy Suuday to take an active
part in tho campaign preceding tho
submission of the amendment, Novem

his efforts, however, that Mr. Farls
decided to take the matter up with
him by correspondence Instead. "1

Sunday's activity put booze out of
business In Colorado and West Vir
ginia," Mr. Farls said. "If ho assists
tho prohibition forces of the state ia
the fight this fall, he'll do the same
for Missouri.
"Submission of prohibition to a voto
then will cost the voters nothing.
"It's too late for the liquor forces
to load tho election down with amend
ments." To fllo the petition it was necessary
to obtain signatures of 5 per cent ot
tho voters In eloven congressional
districts. Jackson County, Mr. Farls
said, supplied ono thousand moro
signatures than tho needed 5 per cent
of the voting strength.

bott Is known
WEZZFUiTfTJZD TO
flist of all as a farmer, mitwllhstueid
Ing that for n score of years ho has
represented his district in the state
legislature. As president of the Illi
nois Farmers' Institute and director of
one of the state's demonstration farms,
Mr. Abbott has done a notable work,
in the midst of this work ho has found
time to cultivate a hobby, which Is, not
to see how many bushels of corn or
oats or wheat he can produce on a
given amount of land, but to mako
something grow where absolutely noth
ing grew before. Tho CO or 70 acres
of sand hills on his farm which ho has
reclaimed In a few years, clothing them
with a luxuriant forest of locust, Cot
tonwood nnd walnut trees, speaks elo
quently of tho practicability ns well
ns the success of his scheme. Moro
than that, these trees, acting us sand
hinders, have Increased many fold tho
value ot tho rest ot his land, for they
protect bis growing crops on the rich
soli from the Inroads of the shifting
sand.
The presence of tho sand hills on
Mr. Abbott's farm makes nn Interest
ing little story. The land lies three
or four miles east ot tho Mississippi
river in western Illinois, on the edgo
of what Is known ns the River bot
toms. When in geological ages tho
channel of the Mississippi was
changed, the sand In tho river bed
wns blown upon tho bluffs on tho east
side of the channel. In the courso
of tlmo tho growth of vegetation In
tho old bed, aided by tho slit depos
ited by Hood waters, made the river
bottoms exceedingly fertile farm lands.

the bluffs became covered with grass,
and, with the advent of tho white mnu,
became tho grazing ground of great
herds of cattle. The grass on tho
hills Is more nutritious than that In
tho valleys, so tho hills were grazed
closely. Then In a dry season tho
grass was killed, the tramping of
many hoofs broko up the turf, nnd tho
sand began to blow, always from tho
southwest to tho northeast, covering
up everything 111 Its courso nnd bury
ing fertile land.
This wns tho situation faced by Mr.
Abbott when ho camo Into possession
of his farm, and for a long time those
dreary sand dunes were a thorn In
his side. Acres of land wero going
to waste, and, what was worse, every
year saw tho sand encroaching still
moro on cultivated land.
Then one day ho had an idea. Stand
ing on tho summit of one of the sand
hills, as If to accentuate the utter bar
renness of Its surroundings, was a
solitary gigantic Cottonwood tree, with
a girth of nt least 10 feet. How the
seed from which it sprang got there,
and by what mlrnclo It had outstripped
In growth nny other tree In the county
was something to ponder on. But
the Hon. A. Barton Hepburn writes In
Leslie's, "for what tho Journey was
bound to disclose, but seeing Is the
only sense that can glvo knowledge
nnd secure appreciation of tho gran
deur, the sublimity, the fascinating
beauty of mountain, sen, strenm, (lord,

glorious color effects which tho daz
zling rays of tho sun bring Into ex
istence. In connection with all theso
Is a land of enchantment for nil who
love and can appreciate nature.
"Tho Thousand Islands with all their
beauty would scarcely servo as a pre
lude to tho surpassing grandeur and
loveliness of tho many thousand Is
lands that adorn the 3,000 miles of

Sleep Is tho final stage In the process ot nutrition.
If one tree would
grow In the .sand, why
not others? Why
couldn't they bo made
to istitw there?
No sooner wns the
plnn conceived than
Mr. Abott began to
experiment. Not
knowing any better,
he nt first planted
many trees not adapt
ed to n sandy soli, but
soon found that tho
black locust and Cot
tonwood made Uie
most satisfactory growth. The locust
in particular did exceedingly well, be
ing a legume which secures Its nitro
gen from tho nlr through the minis
tration of tho bacteria on Its roots.
Moreover, n loose, sandy soil permits
both nlr nnd water to enter. Instead
of the rain running off as In the case
where a tough sod covers the ground,
thus making ideal conditions for tho
development of the bacteria.
Having discovered the right kind ot
tree, Mr. Abbott entered into tho work
of planting them with enthuslnsm. For
deciduous trees ho soon discovered
that a yearling plnnt was preferable
to an older one, being easier to plant,
costing less, nnd standing a better
chance to live. Yenr-old deciduous
trees can usually ho secured from
reliable nurserymen for $5 or less per
thousand, whllo tho cost o planting
them Is relatively small, as two men
tun easily plant U,000 trees a day.
Tho result of tho llrst planting was
apparent In a little over a year, as
tho trees, which were then threo or
four feet high and In n flourishing con
dition, successfully checked tho sand
blowing. In a couple ot seasons moro
the leaves falling to tho ground
formed a forest mulch, which helped
retain tho moisture, and grass began
to creep In, eventually giving to tho
land a value for grazing which It did
not possess before.
Altogether Mr. Abbott hns planted
some 50.000 trees on approximately 50
acres of land, or at tho rato of 1,000
trees per acre, tho fencing being about
0 by 7 feet. Theso trees have
not onlj Increased the value ot
the bind on which they stand about
four-fold, but havo proved most ef
fective barriers In protecting culti
vated fields from tho few remaining
blowholes. The heat In theso blow
holes during Uio summer sometimes
reaches 150 degrees. It Is rather re
markable, how'ever, that even at such
a time, moisture may be found In thu
Hind nt n depth of n few Inches.
An Idea of tho rapidity with which
tho sand drifted before Mr. Abbott
began his treo planting may be gained
from the accompanying photographs,
which show tho original fence post.s
Mirroundlng wmio of the fields now
almost covered. Mr. Abbott Is now,
after a period of live or six years, cut
ting considerable timber from his for
