Developments South of Line
Are Anxiously
Watched.
-San Antonio, Texas., July 8.—For
over 200 miles eastward from 91 Paso,
American troops are held In readiness
today to move to any point on the
border that might be threatened by
newly organized bandits in Chi
huahua.
West of El Paso an alert watch for
developments south of the line is kept.
Officers commanding at all border sta
tions, are prepared for news of the ad
vancing raiders. Reports to Punston
added nothing, however, to the rum
ors of yesterday-
Colonel Gaston, commanding the
American forces in the Big Bend dis
trict, was authorized by General
Funston to make such disposition of
his troops as deemed wise to prevent
Mexican bandits from crossing the
river. He has in the Presidio district
the Sixth cavalry, his own regiment
and the Fourth Texas infantry.
Although taking all precautions, no
minimizing of the reports that Villa
himself is at the head of the new. or
ganization of bandits, army officers
today were not inclined to believe the
bandits would attempt a movement
north.

the Villistas, .who" raided Jlmlnez,
Chihuahua, according to a. report to
day to General Gonzales in Juarez
from General Trevino, commanding
the army of the south.
Washington, July 8.—Word of Car
ranza's decision regarding the form
the diplomatic negotiations for the
settlement of the border difficulties
should take is expected today at the
state department. No advices reached
the Mexican embassy on this point
nor had any communication come
from .Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City.
Closing in On Bandits.
Chihuahua City, 'Mex., July 8.—
I«arge Carranza forces better organ
Used and more completely equipped
than any other units of the de' facto
government's troops are closing In on
the' bandits of southern Chihuahua
and northern Durango, Intent on wip
ing then! out
Jlmlnez, which the VlIHstas captur
ed after, defeating an Inferior force
and killing General Ignado Ramos,
has been occupied again by govern
ment troops. The bandits are fleeing
through the valley of the River Flori
da..
Refugees who left Jlmlnez before
the Villistas were near the city were
responsible for the story that Pancho
Villa commanded the bandits. Noth
ing definite regarding his presence has
been received here.
General Jacinto Trevino today
characterized as absurd' reports that
a revolt against the de facto govern
ment was In progress and that Alvaro
Obregon, minister of war, would take
the field against the bandits.
He said only a few of the chiefs
who had never concluded negotiations
to accept amnesty were concerned
and added that there would be no
reason whatever for General Obregon
to dignify the bandit operations by
assuming charge of the campaign
against them.
"The Villistas already are In re
treat back up the Florida," said the
general. "Large Carranzlsta forces
are now on the scene of the battle
where Ramos was defeated and are
In complete control of the situation.
Military men here explain the delay
in getting into touch with the Villistas
as being caused by the burning out of
bridges which hampered transporta
tion of large bodies of troops. Gen
eral Trevino has announced that he
realizes fully the necessity of any ac
tive systematic campaign that will
ciush out the bandits in short order.
Telegraphic communication- with
Torreon and hence to Mexico City has
been restored and it Is expected that
the burned bridges will be quickly re
stored.
General Brnesto Garcia reports all
quiet in the Parral district.
General Trevino is personally in
vestigating the case of Mrs. Louisa
Towns, the American woman who
charged that she was robbed in
Jlmlnez and threatened with execu
tion by the offenders, if caught- He
says they will be severely punished:

Announcement of Allies'
Offensive Followed by
Disorders.
London, 'July 8.—A dispatch to the
Dally Telegraph from Milan, says
travelers arriving in Switzerland
from Germany report serious troubles
in several German towns and in
Berlin immediately after first news
was received of Anglo-French offen
sive-
Crowds marched through the
streets shouting "enough of war. let
us have peace." The disorders were
different from the customary food
riots and seemed far more serious,
having all the characteristics of a
popular revolt.
Riots at Berlin, it is said, were ex
ceptionally grave, people surrounded
the troops to force them to Join In
the revolt, and took wheels off mili
tary wagons and gun carriages and
used them for barricades.
The most serious demonstration
was at Potsdam on Sunday,- when a
mob indulged in imprecations'against
the kaiser and imperial family.
Printed pamphlets were secretly
handed around, on which were print
ed:
"Death to the kaiser, death to the
crown prince. Long live free Ger
many, free from these parasites who
have led it to ruin."

TERRIFIC ATTACKS MADE.
Berlin, via London, July 8.—Today's news from the western front

In the Thiep-vai sector there was a succession of bitter attacks and
counter attacks. The British several times succeeded by violent as
saults in obtaining a foothold in Thlepval, but each h™ were elected

Big Problems for Germans.
London, July 8.—The head of the
German staff must be faced with diffi
cult and perplexing problems at the
present moment. He must decide,
how to meet the new co-ordinated,
strategy of the Entente Allies and,
how best to utilize Germany's avail
able military resources.
Never "before in the history of the
war has Germany been called upon to
meet a strong double offensive on
both the western and eastern fronts.
"General Haig's statement says:
"We recommend a vigorous offen
sive at dawn, coming on top of the
opening of a new offensive against
Marshal Hindenburg by General Evert
is a new experience for the Germaa
staff.
General Evert" attack Is being
made on a hundred mile front run

line north to Baranovichi in the]
south. The seriousness of the crisis,
is reflected in the paucity of informa

at last admit the loss of Hem and
Belloy on the western front.
There Is no confirmation of the re*
port from Rome that the whole Ger
