BANDIT FORCES GROWING

By WALLACE E. SMITH.
(Internatimai News erview.)
El Paso, Tex., July 7.-Minister of War
Alvero Obregon is preparing to aban
don his post as Carranza's chief cabinet
officer today to take the field against
"Pancho" Villa and that renegade's vic
torious hordes, according to advices re
ceived in Juares from Mexico City.
Impatient at the failure of his comman
der to check Villa's latest campaign and
alarmed by the steady growth of Villa's
forces, Gen. Obregon is said to be ready
to start at an hour-s notice for the
neighborhood of Jiminez.
Meanwhile "Pancho" Villa and his new
Sry. reported to have taken Jimines,
seem to be debating whether to push the
Carranhista force back still farther upon
Chihuahua or direct their attention to
the Torreon district, where American
property worth many millions in located.
Bandit Popular idol.
Villa's success along the 40-mile battle
line between Parral and Jiminez placesI
him In a strong position. Through this
part of Mexico he has aJways been
favored. Carransa officials admit that
Chihuahua City. the headquarters of their
northern army, is really a Villa strong
hold, and that the great majority of the
population is utterly for the picturesque
outlaw. Thousands of men now wearing
the Carransa uniform have been notor
lously eager for a chance to join the
Villa forces.
The chance seems to have eome. VIlla
has issued a call to his arms to all his
old chietaeins especially those serving
Carransa. In addition to this appeal came
the news that Carransa and the United
States government had patched up the
differences between them. With the
chance of shooting "gringoes" dwindling
and their old leader on the war path
there seemed to be little doubt as to the
inclinations of the Villistas.
Men Fleck to standard.
"Pancho Villa's army is growing every
minute." said an arrival from the inter
lor of Mexico, today. "He started against
Parral with about 6M men. He has more
than three times that number now, and
is getting stronger all the time. He
Is equipped as well as the Carranza
forces. In fact, some of the bands under
him wear Carranza uniforms and bear
arms that they brought when they left
the Carranza ranks. Unless they stop
Villa within the next few days they will
never stop him."

and were cut down by machine guns.
There were six charges. Then the French

Twenty Washington monkeys are on
their way to New York to aid the gov

A monkey famine developed yester
(lay, when it was decided to sacrifice
the animals on the altar of science, to
find an effective remedy to check the
disease.
Officials from the Public Health Serv
ice finally succeeded in getting a score
of the monkeys by purchasing the en
tire imian population of a local ani
mal store. They were immediately
shipped to New York.
I Governmental red tape bars the Im
