A BITTER CONTEST
Certain to Result from - Knott's At-
tempt to Have Votes Cor
. rectly Counted 1 '
Jacksonville, July 8. -What is cer
tain to be one of the most bitter . con
tests ever staged in the South will
come out of the effort being made by
Comptroller W. V. Knott and " his
friends to secure recount of the vote
for governor cast in the state-wide
democratic primary of June 6.
According to statements issued at
the headquarters of Mr. Knott, the re
count completed in Suwannee, Madi
sen and Hamilton counties; secured
through order of the ; circuit court,
has wiped out the lead of 260 given
Sidney J. Catts , by v the state " can
vassing board, which certified him as
the gubernatorial nominee of the
party and gives Knott a lead of twen
ty-eight votes. , ;
, Rev. Catts insists that there have
been unfair and illegal methods used
hints at "stuffing" of : the ballot
boxes in Madison county, and has af
fidavits from certain election officials
who presided in precincts of that
county stating that the; returns of
June 6 were correct and that that the
new figures as given after the recount
are not in accordance with the actual
vote cast.
At Knott headquarters the comp
troller ridicule3 the statement that
the ballot boxes have been tampered
with, t He reiterates his statement,
made a few days after the election,
that gross inaccuracies were commit
ted in counting the votes, in that the
second choice votes especially, were
not properly accounted. His counsel
issued a statement saying that in the
Greenville precinct of Madison coun
ty seven men signed the election re
turns, while the law allows only four
to attach their signatures. Other ir
regularities are charged;

COTTON IS THE
INEY COOP
Business Men of the Phosphate City
j
will Promote a Large Acreage -
for the Coming Year
WTiile in Ocala several days ago Dr.
J. G. Ba skin of Dunnellon told a Star
representative that the business men
of the Phosphate City were busy
making arrangements for the handl
ing of, a large acreage of long staple
cotton during the coming year.
He cited the good old times' that
existed in Marion county when our
farmers were devoting their atten
tion to the raising of cotton instead
of trucking. Cotton, while not al
ways worth top-notch prices, is" al
ways staple and can be disposed of
for,, cash, while vegetables are perish
able and must go forward regardless
of the market conditions or remain in
the fields at a total loss to the
grower. ::( ... ; , :
Dr. Baskin, like many : . other men
who have watched events in Marion
county for many years, realizes that
the farmer who sticks to staple farm
ing and stock raising is ahead of the
one who takes long chances on truck
ing.) While the steady profits , from
raising staples are not as alluring as
the fancy prices dreamed of by the
trucker even before his seed begin
to sprout, there is that certainty in it
that should appeal to the farmer as
a business man. ' .-'
The plans now being perfected by
the business men of Dunnellon are
to secure for the farmer a high grade
of cotton seed, assist him in the
financing of his crop, and lastly erect
a ginnery of sufficient capacity to
take care of everything offered.
The territory in the United States
for the growing of long staple cotton
successfully is limited, and no state
in the Union offers such opportuni
ties as Florida on account of our
long growing seasons. -
The uses ofjeng staple cotton for
the manufacture of high grade cloth,
thread and other commodities are in
creasing v this year, and we believe,
with Dr. Baskin, that the sooner the
Florida farmer makes up his mind to
devote his energies to its growth,
rather than chasing the truth "will-o'-the-wisp,"
the sooner he will place
his vocation, on a real, business basis.
We wish the Dunnellon people
success in their venture and trust
that other sections of the county may
follow in their footsteps.

MAXWELL COMPANY WILL
PAY ITS MEN . WHO
GO TO MEXICO
This Decision is in Line with the In-
buiuuuRs oncy xo ia me
Government ,
In accordance with a statement is
sued last week by Walter E. Flanders,
president and general manager of the
Maxwell Motor Company, Inc., of De
troit, that institution has adopted a
broad plan of ..action relative to the
relief of the families of its employes
who have or may-enlist for military
service in connection with the present
dispute with Mexico.
Mr. - Flanders announcement is as
follows: "The Maxwell Motor Com
pany, Inc., will hold positions open
for any of its employes who have
been in its employ more than four
months, who enlist or have enlisted
for the Mexican trouble. While en
gaged in the Mexican trouble, the
company will continue the pay of such
employes who have others dependent
upon them at the rate of one-half
their present salaries, for one year
from this date (June 30) unless the
government shall have made adequate
provision sooner."
A number of Maxwell employes had
enlisted before Mr. Flanders made the
announcement of the company's in
tentions and judging from the enthu
iasm with which the announcement
was received at the various Maxwell
factories when the notice was posted
it will have the effect of stimulating
recruiting from the great army of
Maxwell workers.
More than at score of factory work
ers had enlisted from the Detroit
plant of the company by July 1 and
many others announced their inten
tion 'of goin as soon as they learn
ed that their families .would not suff
er during their absence. In the com
pany's plants at Newcastle, Ind and
Dayton, Ohio, a similar situation ob
tained. The Maxwell announcement i3 in
direct line with the company's policy
of rendering all possible aid to the
T T I i. J i .1 r
uuiteu outtes government in uie Mex
ican crisis.
3Iaxwells on Border
' All during the border trouble, Max
wel cars have rendered efBciect ser
vice and because of its ability to take
the rough roads in the southern coun
try, it has been a favorite with the
soldiers. Maxwell cars have pene
trated far into the Mexican country
and the famous non-stop car gave a
good account of itself when it was
commandeered by United States
troops patrolling the Arizona border.
General Pershing has benefited by
the service of more than 100 Texan
owners, of Maxwel cars, who volun
teered themselves and their cars
when the punitive expedition headed
across the border.
Over forty motor reservists, all
driving their own Maxwell cars, both
men and vehicles being equipped com
pletely for service, have volunteered
from the state of California and are
ready to' move on order from General
Pershing.
