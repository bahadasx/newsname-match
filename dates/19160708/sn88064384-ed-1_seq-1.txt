f ip MICHELIN^
Red Inner Tubes
Have a world-wide reputation for durability
for the following reasons:
|j ?jjl 1st: Michelin Red-Rubber Tubes are compounded
I 1 , iM of certain quality-giving ingredients which prevent
V\
them from
rittle or porous and which // • / i.
ti\' preserve their velvety softness indefinitely.
2nd: Michelin Tubes are not simply pieces
i n
of straight tubing with their ends cemented, / • i.j/lk
1 ^- but are formed on a ring mandrel to My - : /M
exactly the circular shape cf the Jw ', ■' JjF
inside of the casing itself jßy;?
and consequently hi ,-y/A
y ' . -y/Jk
perfectly.
