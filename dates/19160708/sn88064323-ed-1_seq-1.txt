PROGRESSIVE MEETING
The I'logresHive executive com
inittee met here today with a fuil
quorum. Mr E A Pharr presid
trig Priniaries were called for
Sept. L'l Judge \V. P. Martin
Congressman from the third dis.
trict gave out. the following stale
men t.
Statement made by Judge VV.
P. Martin before Third Congres
sional Executive Committee:
Two years ago a large majority
<d the voters of this, the Third
Congressional Disliict, resenting
the free trade policy of the Demo
eraticpaity, as embodied in the
provisions of the Underwood Bill,
severed their connections with
j that organization and joined a
I parly that stood for (lie fair anil
adequate protection for all Amert
can industries
Party ties are not lightly brok
en, and this step wuN not taken by
the voters of this District until
after careful consideration and
due délibérai ton
But when we were deserted by
those who stood pledged to pro
teot us, when our every interest
was attacked, when the Under
wood Pill, with one tell swoop,
placed our products upon the
'•Free List," and ruin and disaster
stared us in the face, self respect
and self preservation* compelled
us to leave the Democratic I'arty,
and afliliate with a party for
whoso principles we could stand,
and whose platform held out some
hope for the futute.
Upon this clear out Issue of pro
teotion versus free trade, the vot
ers of the third Congressional dis
trict, did me the distinguished
honor of electing me as their Hep
resentative in the tilth Congress
by a majority of approximately
fifteen hundred votes.
And, now, upon the eve of a
charge in the National Adminis
tration, the people of this District
are again called upon to decide
the issue of protection versus free
trade.
The Democratic party, in Na
tioual Convention Assembled has
again declared in favor of free
trade by endorsing the provisions
of the Underwood bill, while the
progressive and republican par
ties have both reailiimcd their be
lief in a protective tariff, fairly
and scientifically adjusted, so as
to assure adrquate protection to
all American Industries, and
American Labor.
As the Kepresentative in Con
gress of the Third Congressional
District, I have consistently advo
cated, voted and stood for proteo
tion.
I favor the restoration of fair
and adequate duties upon sugar,
rice, lumber, corn, potatoes, onion,
and all other products of this
State and Country, m need of pro
tection; and to this end I have
voted, and will continue to vote
and with any Party that stands
for the protection of such Indus
tries.
Upon this issue, I now an
nounce myself as a candidate for
the Progressive Nomination to
Congress, and if nominated and
elected, 1 shall devote my time,
and the limit of my ability to the
District and people whom I now
represent, and whom 1 hope to
have the honor to represent in
65th Congress.—Morgan City Re

Certain papers with glaring
headlines announce the three
quarter extra tax, by saying it
was to cover a debt left by Gov
ernor Hall. This is true as far as
it goes, but they might in common
decency have said it was created
by previous administrations, espe.
oially by J. Y. Sanders. It is not
so impoi tant that political asser.
tions should be entirely fair, but
common decency demands they
should seem to be tair and not
palpably a humbug.—Mansfield

John M Parker sent a telegram
to the third district congressional
committee of the Progressive par
ty Monday in which he calls on
the Hull Moose of Louisiana to
keep up the tight against the Dem
ocrats The message, which ans
weis the question of whether Par
ker will return to the Democracy,
was as follows:
"Chairman, Progressive Congres
sional Committee, Morgan City,
La.
"Progressive Party in first plat
form unanimously adopted and
unanimously reafliriued in 1916,
says:
'"The deliberate betrayal of its
trust by the Republican party, the
fatal incapacity of the Democratic
party to deal with the new issues
of the new time, have compelled
the people to forge a new iustru
ment of government through
which to give effect to their will
in laws and institutions.'
"Steam roller at Chicago and

Louisiana Assembly should im
press thiiiking and patriotic citi
zens with the importance of oppo
sition white party throughout
South and West and vifal necessi
ty for our remaiuing loyal to our
pledges aud 'contract with the
people.'
"We should demand immediate
resignation of those endorsing
other parties, should strictly ad
here to our principles, and ask
support and eo-oporatioti of all
parties working for national good
and human welfare.
"We are not seeking to get into
the band wagon. Our principles
are either right or wrong, aud as
long as we firmly believe we are
right, let us continue the light for
our honest convictions, unterrified
by deNerfion and fearless of any
opposition.

MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP
The question of selling the
city's light aud water plant to the
trolley line is being agaiu agitat
ed. It is claimed by the advo
cates of the consolidation of the
two plants that only by this
means can the trolley be made to
pay. The city of New Iberia is
now getting from its light and wa
ter plant a service easily worth
$1000 per month and for which
the city is not paying oue cent.
Should there be a demand, for
some special occasion, for some
'J00 or 600 lamps strung along the
streets for a night, a week, or a
month, they can be had for no
greater cost than the material and
labor for putting them up. If the
Fire Department decides that an
extru (Ue hydrant would do much
towards reducing the risk of fire
loss, or towards the protection of
some factory or business concern,
such hydrant could be put in un
der existing conditions at no
greater cost tbau the needed mate
rials aud labor. With a privately
owned or controlled water and
light plant Buch services would In
volve a cost of materials and la
bor plus a fair rental.
It is demonstrable that the
plant owned by the city is not
costing the people moie than the
special tax voted sixteen years
ago to pay for tie plant. That
tax, we believe, expires this year
by limitation. The plant as pres,
eotly equipped should maintain it*
self. If so, New Iberians have
the rare privilege of enjoying free
public light and water services.
Why should Iberians give this
away—either for the present or
for the future.
Thd hurricaoe warnings for this
section, like war clouds arising
over the Mexican border, have
given away to a bright sunshine,
a genial temperature . balmy
breezes, and the songs of birds. *

EXTENDING.
The L. L Bertrand Lumber (Jo
lias not lost faith in the future of
this section ami are pieparing ti>
entertain Big Husiuess this tall
ami winter. Mr. Luke Bertrand,
the head and general manager ol
the flim, bought some eight of
the machines formerly used by the
sash, door, and blind factory of
the Iberia Cyress Co. These ma
chines are all modern in design
and some of them were bought
new from the factory but a short
while before the big plant closed
down.
These machines were trans|,oit
ed to the factory they will serve
in future during the week. They
were stored till the necessary
building for the proper housing of
them could be erected w hich will
have lo be about as large as the
present factory and when the new
machines will all be ready for seiv
ice, the output capacity of the far
tory will be considerably more
t hau doubled.
Nome time ago a large gasoline
engine was installed to drive the
machinery then Installed. It ten
dered good service; but the price
of gasoline began to soar till it
was doubtful economy to continue
to us« gasoline for fuel After
coriespoudutg with the builders
of the engine, to learn if t here w.is
not some device that might In
added, which would enable the
substitution of coa; oil. instead, of
gasoline, as fuel, Mr Bertrand
conferred with Mr. Jno Augers.
The latter thought it could In
done By an oil teed pipe, coiled
around the escape.pipe, the coal
oil fuel is carried to a high tem
peiatme, so then when sent to the
cylinder through the corburator
aud mixed with air and water, it
renders as reliable service as did
gasoline. After a thorough test
of the change of fuel the new de
vice is pronounced responsive to
every requirement.
These changes were made fully
two and a half mouths ago by Mr
Angers. The engine has to In
started up in the morutngK with
gasoline and run with that fuel
till the oil pipe can be thoroughly
heated. Then there is uo moie
trouble. When the engine L
shutdown for dinner at noon, it b
found that it retaius ample heat
for the oil at oue o'clock and the
machinery is agaiu set humming
without loss of time or ineonvern
ence. Mr. Bertrand said that the
engine is now using a less quanti
ty of coal oil than it did of gaso
line to perform a like task, or pei
hour run full load. This led to
the keeping of accurate recoidi of
the quantity of coal oil used,which,
wheu compared with gasoline a
ruling prices, shows a saving, h
the past LM mouths, of $410
That saving alone represents i.
very fail profit on the work done
With the installation of tb<
eight recently acquired machine!
it is evident that the power uni'
will not be adequate to the call
will not be adequate to the call
for the operation of a fair part ol
the plant at one time. This
means that the power end will
have to be increased at an early
date. Mr. Bertrand is contem
platiug the installation of an oil
burning engine of ample powei
for present and prospective needs.
The increasing of the machines
of tins plant, together with theii
constantly increasing hours ol
work, developed a new problem
demanding solution. There was a
time wbeu the local demand for
the sawdust and flue shavings
from the several machines of the
plant kept the place fairly free of
thiB menace from firs; bnt this re
fuse began to accumulate ahead of
the demand and prompted the
ateking ot other channels for its
disposal By a contract made
with Mr. Emile Simon, the New
Iberia Foundry & Machine Shops
will take the sawdust and shaving
out pat. They will be a&td, in
generating steam, under the foun
dry's boiler. Thus the Bertrand
plant is kept free of shavings.

Saved Girl's Life
*'I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. I firmly believe Black-Drain it
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went In on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble. I shall never be without
BUCTaK
in my home." Por constipation, Indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
aliments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved Itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black
Draught It is a medicine of known merit. Seventy-five
years of splendid success proves Its value. Good for
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.
