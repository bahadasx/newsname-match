tfashlngton, July 4.?President.
Wlhnm today dedicated "to* common
ce easel and a common understand -
lag" a labor temple erected here as
the aew home of the American Fod
etlitloa of Labor. Re told a large au
dss?oe gathered at the dedicatory ex
etijface that the greatest barrier to
industrial peace had been the dtffl
oolty of insuring candid and dis
aajsjonate conference and that **get
g& our fighting blood up" was "the
latig vey and not the ahort way'* of
steering rights.
The president's addreaa waa inter?
rupted twice by a woman suffragist
who sought to heckle him regarding
Me opposition to a national suffrage
amendment. She was silenced by
eat?at service men end finally taken
an ay by the police. The^C^greanJon
iunion announced tonight that the
>rt was but the first step In a new
aajapaign te impress Democratic lead?
ers with the advisability of passing
the amendment at this session of con
green.
Mr. Wilson's plea for calm counsel
brought repeated applause from the
crowd, who . pparently Interpreted it
ee havlpg an Indirect bearing on the
Mexican crisis. The president, how?
ever, did not re for to Mexico or any
er foreign country by name.
The way we generally strive for
eta," he said, "is , by getting our
Illing blood at and I venture to

If we oaly have the patience and
the candor and thu desire to get to?

The president scarcely had begun
to .?peak when th? first interruption
came. The questioner. Miss Mabel
Veinon. of the Woman's party waa
standing only a few feet from him,
and when he declared that In his
position he waa not permitted to think
ef any one class of persons, rbe
shouted:
"If you truly desire to serve all
elaiaee, why do you block the national
auftrage amendment now before con
gretm ? Four million women In this
country?"
The White House secret service men
made their way to Miss Vernon and
quickly silenced her. She tried un?
successfully to induce them to eject
her from the crowd. When she again
sought to Interrupt the president, a|
few mtnutee later, however, city po?
lice led her away from the speaker's
stand. She waa not arrested.
Tie president apparently was un?
disturbed by the incident. He paused
upon the first quest.ion and turned to
look at Miss Vernon and turned to
Mian Alice Paul and Miss Maude
Younger, members of the Congres?
sional union, but ho paid no heed to
the second Interruption.
Nothing that the president said
aroused such enthusiasm as his orati o
of tliat section of the Clayton act de?
claring that labor Is not a com

"I am eorry," he said, "that there
were any Judges in the United States
who had to bo told that. It is so ob.
vloui? that it seems to me that that
section of the Clayton uct was a re?
turn to the primer of human liberty;
but V Judges have to have the primer
opened before them, I am willing to
open It."
Referring to the display of Ameri?
can fftigft carried by the union workers
In a farade which he had reviewed as
part of the exercises, the president
declared the flag always should recall
America's duty In serving the world.
"America," he said, "did not come
Into existence to make one more great
nation in the family of nations, to
show Its strength and to exercise
mastery. America opened her doors
to everybody who wanted to be free

CARRANZA NOTE OPENS WAY
FOR SPEEDY SETTLEMENT
OF ALL DIFFERENCES.
It Is Conciliatory in Tone and Resides
Assuming Part Responsibility for
Presence of American Troops in
Mexico Peldgea Ills Government to
Use Every Means In IDs Power to
Guarantee Sucuriiy of Border.
Washington. July 5.?The reception
of the Carransa note Has ended tem?
porarily all war talk here. High of?
ficials, after hastily reading the pote,
say that It seems to open a way for
a speedy settlement, of all differences.
It breathes a note of conciliation in
every paragraph And Carransa as?
sumes part of the responsibility for
the American troops being in Mexico,
admitting that the security of Ameri
cana was not perfect on the frontier
and was cause of complaint by
America. He now pledjes himself to
employ all the means In his power for
preventing further raids or any other
Incidents that might complicate the
situation.
He accepts in principle the pro?
posals of the Latin-American coun?
tries, for mediation. Secretary Lan?
sing indicates that the note practical?
ly settles everything and points out
that mediation can be accepted un?
der certain conditions. He announc?
ed that he will leave Washington to?
morrow for his home at Watertown,
New York, for a month's vacation.
Secretary Lansing says that the with?
drawal of Gen. Pershing's force is
now a matter for Uie Secretary of War
Baker to decide. Secretary Baker re?
fuses to accept responsibility and says
that Gen. Pershlag went Into Mexico
under the State department and will
remain until the State department re?
quests his withdrawal. Officials say
that Gen. Pershlng will probably stay
aheer he Is for the present, but his
force will be withdrawn as soon as
Carransa gets his troops so disposed
that further border raids are impos
ers Was farther proof of the sincerity
of this government to reach a pacific
and satisfactory arrangement of pres?
ent difficulties. The Mexican govern?
ment only awaits information that the
government of the United States would
be disposed to accept this mediation.
In the meantime this government pro?
poses to employ all efforts to avoid the
recurrence of new Incidents which
may complicate and aggravate the sit?
uation.
The note was officially delivered to
Secretary Lansing and sent to Presi?
dent Wilson. ?

New York, July 4.?Hope that "the
teachers in our public schools will not
yield to the clamor for militarism"
was voiced tonight by William J.
Bryan in an address before the Na?
tional Federation association In ses?
sion here. "It is not the voice of the
people," he said, "but an echo frpm
the battlefields of Europe. The t^
porary excitement of a world
I should not be allowed to disturb o?r
permanent educational system. The
school Is not a transient Institution;
It will abide with us when the battle
flags are furled." ?
"The 'adequate reserves' asked by
one party," Mr. Bryan continued, "4nd
the 'ampb^reserves' asked by 'ihe
other party can not be adequately and
amply supplied without robbing fho
cradle or recruiting in the graded
schools." >
Dr. Willard S. Small, speakingjof
military training in tho high sei
said:
"The purpose of military training In
the high school is not to turn .fiut
trained soldiers. It Is not to qui
tho martial spirit and make
lovers of war. The purpose is teg
itallze the ancient fundamenfuT^id
ineradicable fighting instinct,
it a productive educational inv<
and compel to yield dividends ii
steal and moral discipline."
He added, however, that
drill in Itself has no develoj
value.
HOW TO PRESERVE
TREES.
J; Frank Williams Tells of Pest
Injure Trees' and Fruit si
They May Be Sol
Peas. *
There are two things absolutely
necessary to do in growing peaches in
Sumter county. One of these things
is keeping the borers out of the trees
I arid the other is keeping the San Jose
scale subdued, in order that the tend?
er branches may make any growth.
I The scale is controlled by spraying
with a solution of lime sulphur, while
the trees are in the dormant stage
and right now is the time to begin to
control the borers. Mound all peach
trees with dirt to a height of eight to
ten Inches within the next two or
three days. Then about October 25
level this dirt and you will get rid of
most of the borers. . There are other
sprayings beside the one for scale that
will aid in making better fruit, but
killing the scale will save the trees
provided the borers do not girdle or
ruin the trunks.
For years there has never been
such an abundance of cheap peas in
Sumter county and you should not fail
to take advantage of this opportun?
ity to broadcast every acre of idle
land on your farm. If you have not
already done so, plant some iron or
Brabham peas for your seed another
year. These peas do not have nema
todes or root knot and thereby injure
the land for planting cotton, if there
is a trace of blight or cotton wilt. Al?
ready a large percent of the peas
grown in the county are of these two
varieties and since they are Just as good
if not better than the others why not
eliminate all but the iron and Brab?
ham varieties. The Brabham are ex?
actly like the iron in every particu?
lar except they are slightly more pro?
lific.
We cannot grow too much forage
this year, especially those who are
figuring on shipping cream.

County Agent.

R. H. Barrow Attempts to Save His
Daughter and Both Drown in Sight
of Members of Family.
Spartanburg, July 4.?R. H. Bar?
row, of 233 south Liberty street and
his little daughter, Jennie Sue, 13
years of age, were the victims of
quicksand when they were drowned
in Pearson's pond near the Oountry
club east of the city this afternoon,
while Mrs. Barrow and three little
sons stood near the edge of the water
and were unable to give assistance.
The accident occurred in a small
body of water near which the mem?
bers of the Barrow family had spent
the afternoon on a family picnic.
Miss Jennie Sue Barrow had gone
into the pond to wade when she was
seen to be sinking beyond her height
and Mr. Barrow, with his clothing on,
entered the water to go to her assist?
ance. When he approached her he,
too, began to sink and the child dis?
appeared, but in her struggles seized
her father about the neck, which car?
ried him below the water for a mo?
ment. His head, however, reappeared
above the water but imbedded in the
quicksand above his knees, ho was
never able to extricate himself and
waa drowned standing up with the
top of his head showing above the
surface of the pond.
Mrs. Barrow and the smaller chil?
dren who had witnessed the tragedy
'gave the alarm, but It was some time
before there was response. Those
who removed the bodies from the
water say the accident was due to
the preesnce of a deep deposit of
quisksand In the pond Into which the
little girl had sunk almost to her
waist and Mr. Barrow above his

CAMPAIGNERS IN NEWBTRRY.
BIG CROWD GATHERS TO HEAR
CANDIDATES MAKE THEIR
SPEECHES.
Former Governor Blease Given Cordial
Reception in His Home Town?Can?
didates Make Usual Addresses to
Audience.
Newberry, July 1.?Before a crowd
of 3,000 people the candidates for
State odices presented their claims for
the various offices today, wind.ng up
the second week of the county to
county canvass. The crowd was com?
posed largely of farmers but there
were several of the Blease leaders
present from Greenwod, Abbeville,
Laurens, Anderson, Columbia and
Clarendon county. The audience gave
Former Gov. Cole L. Blease a cordial
reception and several times during
his attack on the administration of
Gov. Manning his followers voiced
their approval.
Gov. Manning made a vigorous pre?
sentation of his administration, telling
of the laws placed on the statute book
favorable to the farmer and the la?
boring people. He dwelt at some
length on the law enforcement record
saying that the blind tigers and gamb?
lers had been driven to cover. The
governor took up the work of th"
State tax commission and its effort.,
towards equalization of the burdens of
taxation, and then told of the borrow?
ing of money to run the affairs of
the State government at 2 per cent, in?
terest, the lowest in the history of the
State. He showed the business advan?
tages to the State and the large
amount saved for the taxpayers in
the refunding of the bonded debt.
Mr. Manning went into details con?
cerning the reorganization of the State
Hospital for the Insane, describing the
conditions which he found in that in?
stitution when he came into office as
"so horrible as to beggar descrip?
tion." In telling of his intention to
continue his law enforcement policy
the governor said: "I have no apolo?
gies tpmake tog gaX^l)?*.*^
for I did what I thought was right."
He was given a bouquet of flowei s.
Former Gov. Blease was greeted
with cheers when he arose to speak.
He at once struck at the administra?
tion of Gov. Manning, describing it as
the most lawless and extravagant in
the history of the State. The former
governor claimed that his campaign
had caused Mr. Manning to revoke
the commissions of negro notaries
public. He jumped on the boards
created under the present administra?
tion. He especially assailed the board
of charities and corrections and the
tax commission and its chairman, A.
W. Jones, charging that he paid noth?
ing but a poll tax "and 85 cents of that
ought to be returned." He read a let?
ter from the auditor of Clarendon
county in reference to the return
which Gov. Manning made of his
property in that county, charging that
it was worth very many more times
than the price at which it was return?
ed for taxation. Mr. Blease was pre?
sented with several baskets and
bouquets of flowers and baskets of
peaches.
Robert A. Cooper followed Mr.
' Blouse. Several of the audience had
I left but he went into his subject and
j soon held their close attention. Mr.
I Cooper said that he reiterated today
j what he said two years ago, that en?
forcement of the law was the para?
mount issue of the campaign, that no
'people could be a great people and no
State a great State unless it was law
abiding. He said that if elected gov?
ernor he would not interfere with the
verdicts of juries unless shown that
there had been error. The Laurens
man advocated building up the coun?
try schools and said he was in the
race on his own man and asked the
people to judge him on his merits. He
was given some applause when he
concluded.
J. M. DesChamps was hoarse but
he made himself heard without diffi?
culty and he made his daily vigorous
assault on factionalism. He called
on the people to do away with petty
politics and to get In behind those
things which go to upbuild the State
and make for the betterment of man?
kind.
John T. Duncan was the last speak?
er and he told the crowd of the "sys?
tem."
Andrew J. Bethen, candidate for
lieutenant governor, opened the speak?
ing this morning. His opponent, Dr.
B. C, L Adams, was detained in Co?
lumbia uji business and sent a v.ic

thicker with the dust as they neared

the dusty blistering day ah

siderable area and the view from the
top of the hill near headquarters pre?
sents a tented panorama that looks
like the rendezvous of an army fit to
subdue Mexico without hard breath
ling, in contrast with sandy clearing,
populated by a few straggling soldiers,
it was ten days ago. Stumps, grass,
underbrush and trash have disappear?
ed from the streets; kitchens, of new
yellow, unpalnted pine boards, rear
themselves up over the rows of tents;
barns, booths and bath houses com?
bine to make the little city look per?

Coupled with the change In the ap?
pearance of the camp has been the
change In the appearance of the men.
The sun is persistent and unfailing at
Styx and most of the men are sun?
burned to the point of disguise. The
sunburn varies from the first pinkish
blush on the white arm of the newly
arrived "rookie" to the dull brown of
an old pipe well burned on the face
and forearms of the veterans. Several
companies are all broken out with
mustache; sideburns and goatees have
a few devotees. Another curiosity in
the appearance of the men is the
number of wrist watches worn. These
dainty feminine ornaments have been
found very convenient in the rough
and tumble of camp life and have a
growing popularity, especially among
officers.
