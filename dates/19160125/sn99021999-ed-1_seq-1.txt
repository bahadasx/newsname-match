'.illow Wrwli Ocearrcd.
Blame tor tha wreck' oannot be placed

lanta, without orders.
A relief train with doctors and nurses
was sent from Holdrege.
Dead end Injured were brought to thla
city. '
No. 7 carried only a few passengers, as
It was within fifteen miles of the end of
Its run. The freight contained only four
cars. '
The wreck occurred at a reverse curve
In a cut. with no chance of either engi
neer seeing the other before the two
rains met. The trains did not scatter
over the ngnt-or-way, dui couapwo.
Fix Ins; the Blame.
OFFORD, Neb., Jan. 24. (Special Tele
gram.) The wreck of passenger train No.
7 and an extra freight on the Burlington
this afternoon is regarded here as the
fault of the local freight crew.
They got orders at Mascot, but were
supposed to keep off all passenger trains'
time. They, pulled out of Mascot on No.
7's time and the oolllsslon occurred about
a mile and a half out of Atlanta.
Recent Bhnk.ap la Craws.
There has been quit a shake up in
train crews of late and It has caused
considerable confusion. The freight was
in charge of Conductor Brooks? formerly
on a passenger, and both brakeraen were
former conductors set back.
The wreck will probably be cleared so
that traffic may be resumed about 10:30
tonight
This was the first day for a dally local
freight and It was manned by . a - new
. crew.

Big Donation Party to Mark
Samuel Gompers' Next Birthday
Thursday, January 27, is to be notable
by one of the llnest of donation parties
ever staged. On that dsy every member
of organised labor in the jurisdiction of
the American Federation of Labor is ex
pected to donato his wages for the sec
ond hour of whatever shift he works to
the relief of the members of the Hatters'
union of Danbury, Conn.
It Is Samuel Oompers' birthday, and the
donation wltl be In the way of celebrating '
the event.
Some twelve ytara ago the firm of
Loewe A Co. of Danbury, then being on
the "unfair list," Instituted suit against
the United HatUr of North America, the
hatters' International union, and attached
the property and bank accounts of the
members of the Danbury union. Thla
suit was pressed through the federal
courts for years, going to the supreme
court -of the United States three times,
and finally being decided against the hat
ters. The trial court had allowed the
plaintiff, Loewe A Co., threefold damages,
under the provision of the B her man anti
trust law, which permitted the assessment
of damage in treble the amount actually
sustained. The damage proven under the
secondary boycott was 180,000, which
brought the original judgment up to $240,-
With Interest and costs this was In
creased to over $300,000. All the money tn
the banks to the credit of the defendants
under attachment has been taken over
and now their homes are being sold under
judgment.
D. Loewe, the original defendant, is
dead, and his firm has gone out 'of busi
ness, and many of tbe original defendants
are dead also. Too suit a as kept alive
by the American Anti-Boycott associa
tion and the creditors of Lntwe It Co.,
who will take ever tbe proceeds of the
sale of the homes of the Danbury hatters.
Organised labir U opposed to making
any donation thaj. will go in any way to
the benefit of the judgment creditors, but
Jkans
ar Sufferers
"A small donation from those who can
arrord to contrtote, taken In the aggre
gate, would total a large amount. As the
president haa designated January 27 a
a day for the American people to con
tribute to the unfortunate Jewish peo
ple in Europe, 1 as executive of the
state, knowing that nationality of peo
ple as I do, to be Industrious, patrlotlo,
law-abiding citizens, ask the people of
Nebraska to contribute their mite and
send the donations to Morris) Levy of
Omaha. He Is a man of splendid stand
ing and the money sent htm will reach
those who are In need In Kurope.
"I know I speak the real sentiments of
that nationality of people when 1 say
that any assistance given to their un
fortunate people In Europe will be highly
appreciated by the American cltlxens of
that nationality, and I feel that we win
be doing a righteous and Christian act
by aiding them.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. The su
preme court today upheld the. con
stitutionality of the income tax law.
Chief Justice White gave the court's
decision, sweeping aside all the
many objections to Its constitutional
ly in whole or In part.
Chief Justice White announced
the decision In the case of Frank Jl.
Drushhaber, stockholder of the Un
ion Pacific railroad, who sought to
enjoin the company from paying the
tax on the ground that it was uncon
stitutional. Most of Justice White's opinion
was directed toward overruling the
contention that the Income tax
amendment provided a hitherto un
known power of taxation. Going far
Into the mystery of income tax legis
lation, the chief Justice concluded
the argument was without merit.
Advancing to other points the chief jus
tlce held that the tax was not unconsti
tutional because It was retroactive.
Tho argument that the law was uncon
stitutional because labor, agricultural and
horticultural organizations and such were
exempt, the chief justice held waa n.
swered by decisions under the corpora
tion tax law. Ho said the point was only
another illustration of an erroneous as
sumption that the tax was Imposed under
a new power conferred upon the govern
ment by tho sixteenth amendment,

"Plans are now under way to Induce

says Bdgar Howard In an editorial In

Charles W. Bryan, It will be" rcmmlrcd

Both 'Vharlcy" Bryan and Etear

a leader who can lead,, uecordiiig to tho
tone of Mr. Howard's editorial. Hefoirlntf

MONTENEGRINS ARE DISARMING
Hapsburj Army Headquarter! Says
Invaders Received Gladly and
with Ceremony.
EAGER TO GIVE UP THEIR GUNS
BERLItf. Jan. 24. (Via London
Wireless.) Scutari has been oc
cupied by Austro-Hungarlan troops,
according; to an announcement Is
sued today by the Auetro-Hongarian
headquarters. Several thousand
Serbians who formed the garrison
retired toward the south without of
fering any resistance.
The text of the statement follows:
Scutari has been occupied by.
Austrn-Hungarlan troops. Several
thousand Serbians who formed tCb
garrison, retired toward tbe south
without resistance.
"Austro-Hungariana also have oc
cupied Niksic, Danllovgrod and
Podgorllta.
Lay Down Their Arms.
"The disarming of the country has been
carried on up to the present without
friction. At several places the Monte
negrins have not even waited until the
Austro-Hungnrlans appeared, but have
laid down their arms before the arrival
of the troops In order to return to their
homes. At other places a majority of
those disarmed prerer internment to being
sent home.
"The population generally has received
our troops In a friendly manner, and in
some Instances with ceremony. Rlota
such as ocourred at Podgorltxa ceased as
soon aa the first Austro-Hungarlan de
tachment appeared."
Scutari was occupied by. Montenegrin
troops In June 1915, It being explained In
an official note Issued by the Montenegrin
government that strateglo and political
reasons impelled the Montenegrin descent
on Albania. An additional reason given
was that other powers already had oc
cupied portions of that country. '

Beutarl a the most Important trading
town In Albania and has a population of
Bo.OOO. It He, 0n thgyistbjyik, of tskm
Boutarl and has been rebuilt einee the

During the Balkan war Scutari was the
object of contention between Montenegro
and the great powers. . The. town was
captured by Montenegrin forces on April
O. IMS, after a rlege lasting seven months. 1
The powers previously had decided ta
include Bcutert In the kingdom of Albania
and King Nicholas had been offered com
pensation In money and territory on con
dition that he glvs up. tho place. The
Montenegrin king declined tho offers,
however, and announced he would hold
Beutarl against the powers. As a result
