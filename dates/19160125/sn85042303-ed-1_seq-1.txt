what was perhaps the most brilliant,

ed ami those present were entertained
by the full orchestra of the high school
ioiiipus.il of twenty-two pieces, and
at Vim o'clock the banquet hall was
thrown open and the fun commenced.
The First Feature
Immediately after the Invocation,
pronounced by lr. Cooper, President
W. .1. Kniger who was the "roasttnas
ter" of the evening, began an address
which, however, had not proceeded
ten winds, when the hall was thrown
into utter darkness, and while ex
plaining that "the Klks had evidently
forgotten to pay their light bill," a
splendid electric sign appeared in a
myriad of colors above the speaker's
head, on which was Inscribed: "Ard
more expects to double Its trade, build
roads lo the oil -tind cotton fields, and
to double its population in llllti."
When the applause had died down
and tiie lights again lurned on, the
toastmaster again got up and asked,
whether "programs" were not "part
and parcel of banquets." Velio Sugg
began to explain that the presses of
the Ardinorelte had broken down and
that Itinger was grinding them out on
his Ice cream freezer,- when several
newsboys broke into the hall, yelling
"Gridiron Extra Daily Ardmoreite,"
and a perfect miniature copy of Ard
more's greatest daily was delivered to
the guests, the contents of which com
prised jokes and hits at the expense
of the members of Hie Association.
Krueger Gets "His."
Then a committee comprised of Sig
lor, Raines, and Ringer approached the
toastmaster's seal with an elegant
"package" which with splendid eulo
gy by Mr. Sigler was presented and
turned out to be a rusty hatchet. Mr.
Krueger had been posted prior to the
meeting that the merchants had made
up a purse to make him a little pres

Secretary Gilbert was then intro
duced, ostensibly to make a talk on
how to "develop business." In elo
quent terms he tersely spoke of the
trade possibilities of Ardmore and said
that for the benefit of other merchants
he had been permitted lo "give a prac
tical demonstration" of how a business
had been developed from a unall con
cern lo one of the largest in the south
west. Curtains at the lower end of
the ball were then drawn, and a repre
sentation of J. 1!. Spragins, sitting,
fishing out of a wash tub, with gun,
ammunition and dog, brought down
the house with no more amused spec
tator than Mr. Spragins himself who
had been seated in close proximity to
the stage.
Richards' Winning Ways
An announcement of Professor Rich
ards' candidacy for state superinten
dent was followed by "The Prof." ask
ing a boy if he was going to vote for
him.
"Not if there is anybody else in the
race," was the reply, and then the al
leged professor proceeded to take the
boy across a desk and administer his
"persuader."
M. O. H. Hit.
The running down of W. It Hurnitt,
a member of the association by detec
