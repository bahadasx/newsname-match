MOTHER! GIVE CHILD
"SYRUP OF FIGS" iF
TONGUE IS COATED
Ifcrbss, feverish, sick, bil
ious, clean little liver
and bowels
Children lovo this "rait, tax
tivo," and nothing else cleanses
the tender stomach, liver and
bowels bo nicely.
A child simply will not stop
playing to empty the bowels, and
the result is, they become tight
ly clogged with waste, liver gets
sluggish, stomach sours, then
yonr littlo one becomes cross,
half-tick, raverish, don't eat,
sleep or act naturally, breath is
bad, system full of cold, has sore
throat, stomach ache or diarrhoea!
Listen, Mother! See if tongue'
is coated; then give a teaspoon
ful of 'California Syrnp of Figs,
and in a few hours all the con
stipated waoto, sour bile and nn
digested food passes out of the
system, and you have a well,
playful child again. ..-S
Millions of mothers give "Cal
ifornia Syrnp of Figs" becanse
it is perfectly harmless; children
love it, and it never fails to act
on the stomach, liver and bowels
Ask your druggist for 1 50c
bottle Of "California Syrup of
Fiea" which has full directions
forj babies, children of all ages
and for. grown-ups plainly print
ed on tne bpttle. Beware of
counterfeits sold here. Get the
genuine, made by "California
Fijj Syrnp Company." Refuse
any other kind with contempt.
