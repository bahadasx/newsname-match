Fight as They Fall Buck
Monastir and Gievgeli, southern
Serbian towns held by the Teutonic
allies, have been attacked again by a
squadron of French aeroplanes.
Bombardment of Nancy, France, by
the Germans has been renewed. Aside
from those minor happenings the
military situation is virtually un
changed. On the principal fronts the
great bulk of the armed millions re
mains inactive, with only aerial bat
tles, big gun bombardments and oc
casional thrusts with small forces of
infantry to break the monotony of the
deadlock.
The French aerial raid was made
by a squadron of 111 aeroplanes, some
of which traveled 190 miles to attack
the Teutonic defenses along the
southern border of Serbia. It. is esti
mated unofficially that 100 persons
were killed or wounded at Gievgeli.
All French machines returned safely.
The bombardment of Nancy was
carried on by German guns of long
range as was the case early this
month when for three days 15-inch
projectiles were nurled into the city,
killing six persons and wounding ten.
On the present occasion the city ap
parently has fared less ill. Paris re

Colored Folk Plan to

The Uplift Stearing Committee of
the Interdenominational Conference
of Colored Ministers met last evening
at the Wesley Union A. M. F. Zion
Church for tile purpose of planning
how a benefit might be raised by all
the colored people of Harrisburg and
Steelton for the Harrisburg Hospital.
Nearly all of the churches were rep
resented in Harrisburg and Steelton

elected: The Rev. W. A. Ray, presi
dent; Dr. A. Leslie Marshall, vice
president; W. H. Craighead, secre
tary; S. E. Burrs, assistant secretary,
and James M. Auter, treasurer.
A committee was appointed to de
vise means by which the organiza
tion shall work to raise a large sum
of money in the near future for the
hospital. Nearly all present spoke
enthusiastically along this line and de
plored the fact that so little has been
done by the colored people of the
city for this institution. The commit
tee will hold regular weekly meet
ings in an effort to plan n campaign
to raise the amount that It wishes to
donate to the hospital.

"Button Day" Causes
Suspension at Mines
Special to the Telegraph
Lykens, Pa.. Jan. 25. —To-day is
"Button Day" at the Susquehanna
foal Company's colliery at Wiconisco
and when officials of the Mine Work
ers' Union investigated this morning
they found seventy-three men who
had not paid their dues and who did
not wear the union buttons. Others
miners, in good standing in the unions
refused to work with these men and
between 700 and 800 refused during
the day to go into the workings on
the various levels.
Coal company officials said at 1
o'clock this afternoon that they did
not expect any trouble and that they
were unable to tell when the men
would again return to work. It has
been a long established custom for
I union miners to refuse to work in the
mines with men who do not wear the
union button on "Button Day." The
opinion is advanced that during this
afternoon and to-nigiit tlie delinquent
miners will pay their dues and every
person will be working to-morrow.

New Note From Germany
May Bring Satisfactory
Close to Lusitania Case
Washington . Jan. 25.—Secretary
Lansing had before him to-day an
other written proposal from Germany
designed to bring about a settlement,
of the controversy over the sinking
of the liner Lusitania. It was sub
mitted through Ambassador Von
Bernstorff.
Although strict secrecy surrounds
the negotiaiions it was indicated to
day that the proposal might result
in a satisfactory ending to the long
standing negotiations on the subject.
It is understood that in the latest
proposal Germany has agreed to
eliminate from the text of the agree
ment any menlion of the warning
issued by the German embassy the
day the Lusitania sailed and has left
out her proposed general reservation
of admission of wrong doing on the
.part of her submarine commander.
These two points, it is understood,
were contained in previous proposals
and were strenuously objected to by
President Wilson.
It was also said that in its latest
proposal the Berlin government
makes some reference to a desire to
see this country take action in regard
to questions involving the freedom of
the seas. Germany, it is said, re
iterates that the torpedoing of the
Lusitania was an act of reprisal for
the British blockade of (he German
coast. Regret is expressed for the
loss of the American lives and indem
nity is offered.

not wear overcoats and heavy clothing

Spring-like a.s it is at present.
"Too many people think that they
are able to withstand the disease and
they are fooling themselves," he said.
"Everyone should take extra precau

pneumonia.
Fraternal organizations, paying sick
benefits, along with insurance and
