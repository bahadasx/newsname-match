ARMOR PLATE MAKERS
WILL NOT GIVE PRICE
Senate Committee Will Re
commend Government
Owned Plant
Washington, Jan. 25. Armor plate
manufacturers today refused to tell the
senate naval committee the cost of thoir
products. As a result, the hearing bv
which those in favor of private plate
manufacture hoped to postpone a favor-
aoie report on a government armor bill,
was practically ended, and the bill will
bo reported favorably.
When Senator I'oindexter queried tho
plate men as to the cost, they replied
that this was a trade secret, which it
was unfair for the government to seek
since the latter is contemplating enter
ing the business.
"Well, this ends the hearing as far
as I nin concerned," retorted I'oindex
ter. "These gentlemen have been given
an opportunity to state their case, and
have declined."
The plnte men agreed nt roindcxtor's
suggestion' to give the figures secretly
to the committee, but Senator Clapp de
clared thnt he would not receive any
information as a public officer which
he could not give to tho public.
President Dinkey of the Midvnle com
pany then said that the navy depart
ment estimate of $202 a ton is nearly
correct, though the real cost Is slightly
higher. The committeemen said that
thev wanted the nlnto men's own books

Minority Leader Mann
Puts Politics Aside
Washington, Jan, S-". America is In
more danger of war with England than
with Germany, declared Minority Lead
er Mann today in announcing he will
support plans for Increasing this na
tion's military preparedness. He urged
creation immediately of a standing
army of from 21,000 to 8110,000, amplo
const fortifications, and navy "able
to defend us on the sens."
A crowded house heard the republi
can lender's remarks and greeted them
with a burst of applause. He urged
nonpartisan consideration of prepared
ness and support for the administration
in Its efforts to Improve defense condi
tions. "It Is well known thnt I have never
been in favor of a large standing
army," he said, "and 1 supimss I have
been properly clnssed a a 'little navy'

,State Department Will Serve
Unequivocal Protest On
England
BRITISH CANNOT MAKE
LAWS FOR WHOLE WORLD
English Position May Have
Grave Results Unless Re
ceded From
Washington, Jnn. 23. Pursuing its
purposo of halting British trade inter
ference, tho state department has prac
tically completed the drafting of a vig
orous, unequivocal protest to England,
declaring in substance that the United
States will not recognize as legal the
British "trading with tho enemy" law
if it disturbs commercial relations of
American firms with German interests.
This new phase of the interference
subject will be forwarded soon to Am
bassador Tago in tho list of presenta
tions to be presented to Downing
street.
Tho virtual protest docs not ques
tion England's right to apply the net
prohibiting "trading with the enemy"
to its own citizens, but it does hold
.is illegal any interference with the
trade of Americnn firms in which Ger
man citizens or German money are in
terested. Moantimo, negotiations over tiio
Lusitunia case with Germany have ap
parently taken an unsatisfactory turn,
for it is indicated that fresh proposals
turned to the government today do not
ineet American demands fully.
As for the Persia case, this govern
ment will tako up with Turkey the
matter of disavowal, reparation, pun
ishment and subscription to Americnn
demands in conduct of sea warfare,
should Turkey admit responsibility for
the torpedoing. If, however, she denies
responsibility, tho incident will be
closed.

The cold wave and snow were

present snow will not last long.
She Loved Mulatto for Years
and Furnished Money for
Elopement
S lit Lake City, Ftah, Jan. 21.
Charging that Mrs. Viola Hood, hnnd
somo wife of a San Diego hotel man
inudced him to elope with her, Ray
mond Bodds, negro, surrendered him
self to the police here today. Soon af
terward. Mrs, llool Walked into police
headquarters.
According to the police Mrs.. Hood
thereupon verified the negro's story.
and confessed that ho had not threat
ened her, though she had sent her hus
band massages saying the negro had
declared he would kill or harm her.
I)odds told the polico that he had
decided to give himself up after seeing
in the newspapers that Mrs. Hood's
husband and the police of southorn Cal
ifornia were seeking him. Ho declared
that he had parted with Mrs. Hood last
night after arriving here. They had
registered at a cheap rooming house,
but he compelled her to leave it, ho
ssid, when he found it was "im
moral." "We have been pretty close friends
for va year," said tho negro who had
been in tho employ of the Hoods as
chauffeur. "She wanted mo to skip
with her several times. I thought of
leaving her to keep out of trouble, but
every time, she woVId put her arms
around mo, nnd cry, and ask me to stay.
I couldn't leave. At last we decided
to skip, 'o we came here, and then
she decided that she wanted to return
to Sna Diego.
Aim To Oet Married.
"Vt'e were going to get married hero
and continue to Chicago.
"She changed her mind, and wished
to wiro lor mother tcr a return ticket
to San Diego."
Tho woman, who entered tho police
station soon after Dodds, verified the
entire story according to the polico,
and said thnt the negro had not threat
ened her. She declared she would re
turn to Sau Diego if Dodds wore per
mitted to go on to Chicago.
It is likely, however, that the police
will hold him on a wihte slave charge.
She declared, according tothe police,
that she left her husband because she
was in love with Dodds.
Dodds claimed he and Mrs. Tfnn.1 hnd
been closo friends a little over nine
months. He declared he was attracted
to her, and that the attraction seemed
to be mutual. Thoir relations, he added.
were not suspected by Hood, and Dodd's
presence near Mrs. Hood could always
be explained by his employment as
parier, nouseman and chauffeur.
Woman Threatened Suicide.
-The negro declared they had dis
cussed their future many times, and he
had declared it would bo an easy mat
ter t0 quit his wife, if Mrs. Hood would
leave her husband. Several times, he
said, he had -tried to' leave Mrs. Hood,
but she had threatened suicldo and
ench time ho had acceded to her wishes.
They finally ngrocd, he said, to elope
and be married in another state under
an assumed name,
"We made up our minds to go to
Chicago," ho said, "and she furnished
the money. We went from San Diego
to Los Angeles, and there we bought
tickets to Salt Lake City, with money
she furnished. I presume it was Hood's
money, for I don't know that she has
money of her own. We bad no trouble
in getting the tickets, though I was
mighty scared of tho conductor. We
had separate berths and I spent most of
the time in tho way car and tho smok
ing room.
Place Not "Respectable."
"Arriving here, I took her to a room
ing bouse while I went to another. I
learned Inter that her rooming house
was not respectable, so 1 took her to a
hotel. I wanted to leave, her there and.
we tnlked over the plan of her tele
graphing her mother at Han Dingo and
getting money to go home on. Then she
thought of giving herself up to the
police and asking them to give her a
ticket home. I was willing, but when
it come to a show down, she said that
if t did not stay with her, she would
kill herself.
"I quieted her and left for the night.
Then 1 ssw the newspapers and I was
afraid she would kill herself In my
absence, J gave myself up, fearing she
would hill herself and then I would be
charged with her murder.
"I never did threaten to kill Mrs.
Hood, and I have always been kind to
her. She planned the elopement and
timed the whole deal."
Mrs. Hood had no comment to make
when she was told that the newspapers
reported her husband on bis- way to
Suit Lake, lie will not be permitted to
see Dodds.

He Can Accomplish Nothing
Unless It Is To Continue
Murdering Americans
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 25,-Gcneral
Francisco Villa, outlawed Mexican
chieftain, is endeavoring to stage a
"come back."
From the tattered remnants of a onco
mighty fighting force, he has horded
together a nondescript army of 2,000
men, according to reports here todny.
TIub army is said to bo trying to join
another of "00 men under General
Pcdriccna.
These reports, coupled with Mexican
demands for punishment of alleged
American cattle thieves and the Amer
ican trooper, Harrison, who shot a Car-
ranza civilian last week as the latter
tried to cross the Bio Grande gave
authorities ground today for some mis
giving. In presenting their demands,
tho Juarez authorities reported a grow
ing anti-American sentiment because of
the execution of the two Duran broth
ers, Mexicans, in payment for the loss
of ono American's life.
While officials fcol that Villa's at
tempts to gather a new army cannot be
long successful, they admit that he may
be in a position to harrass. the Car
ranzistas for a time, and to wreak a
bloody vengeance on Americans.

Thinks Conditions May Arise
After War That Cannot
Be Anticipated
Washington, Jan. 25 IVcsident Wil
son is committed to establishment of a
tariff commission to Investigate indus
trial conditions with a view to submit
ting to congress recommendations for
schedules suited to all demands, the
White House announced today.
Healizing that after tho war, certain
economic cliangcs will arise, which can
not now bo anticipated, the president
believes that a board of responsible
business men, similar to the federal re
serve board, should be named to inves
tigate tho trndo of country.
Jt is not his purpose, .lowever, to di
vest congress of any of Its present
powers, for congress would recommend
and act on the commission report.
Tho announcement presents a change
from the nresident's position a year
ago when he announced that ho wished
to give the present tariff an oppor
tunity to work itself out before
changes were made. From time to time
since then, he hns said that owing to
unnatural commercial conditions, aris
ing from tho war, the present tariff
has not had an opportunity to show its
strength or weakness. Moreover, In
answer to republican jdvocnev of a
permanent tnril't commission, he has
iiiuir!i.-ii mm. iiiu niiiiuninirituon nail,
In the federal 1 1 ado commission, the
machinery wherewith to conduct any
required tariff investigations.

The Post Thinks England
Should Not Try Hard to
Conciliate America
London, Jan. 25. France has urged!
England to decluro an immediate block
ade of Germany without waiting for
further protest from neutral nations, it
ie roported. This action, coming on tb
evo of parliament discussion of th
blockade subject, strengthened the posi
tion of Lord Beresford and other advo
cates of a strict actual blockade of the.
Teutons to replace tho present technical
blockade under tho order in council.
Advocates predicted today that a.
strong sentiment in the house of com
mons in favor of their proposal will
force tho government to act immediat
ely.
Tncy oocluro thut the ulockada
should be put into effect simultaneous
ly with conscription to prove to Ger-
any that England is in deadly car-
nest in her determination to overwhelm
the Teutons at any cost. The cons
cription bill passed tho commons finally '
Inst night with only 30 votes in oppo
sition and went to the lords for. the
first reading.
Koports that Sweden has appointed
a committee on defense, though omin
ously interpreted in some quarters, lent
oncouragoment to tho pro-blockade i'ne
tion. They will argue in parliament
tomorrow that decisive action is ne
cessary to cut Off obje.ions by neilal
nations.
In a letter to the Morning Post, Lord
Beresford today protested against hon
oring passports lor American Germane.
Tho Post printed another letter, saying
that Englishmen are not liked in An

not try hard to conciliate that nution.
