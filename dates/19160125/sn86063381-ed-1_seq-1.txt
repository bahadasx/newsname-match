BLANCHE SWEET IN "THE
CAPTIVE" AT GRAND TONIGHT
Blanche Sweet in "The Captive,"
a photo-dramatization ot the play by
the same name by Cecil B. De Mille
and Jeanie McPherson, will be shown
tonight at the Grand theater. It is
a love drama of unusual quality, the
incidents of which all take place dur
ing the recent Balkan conflict be
tween Turkey and Montenegro. It
is the story ot an aversion that turns
into love the nairative of a romance
which begins with hate, seeming to
justify the assertion that anything is
better than indifference.
The two principal characters in
"The Captive" are a Montenegrin
peasant girl and a Turkish noble,
who is made a prisoner of war and
assigned to the peasant to do the work
on her farm and who in the end,
saves her irom the Turkish mauraud
ors The leading man role is played
by House Peters, who was also Miss
Sweet's leading man in "The War
rens of Virginia."

HFORD
W
PEACE PLANS
FAILED THROUGH
LACK OF FAITH
Expedition to Europe Was a Succes
sion of Errors, Writes
Stewart.
PARTY CONTINUALLY
QUARRELED NO HEAD
Hanna Leaves Party, Saying it Will
Cost Him Thousands to Explain
to Constituents.
By Chas. P. Stewart.
(United Press Staff Correstjondent)
The Hague, Jan. 25.Henry Ford's
peace mission has failed for lack of
"faith." According to his own state
ment, faith was Ford's sole stock
when he started. He had not enough
and those who accompanied him, with
a few exceptions, appear to have had
but little.
Mental Science Treatment.
Those of the party who really
wished the expedition well, were FO
bitterly hated thjat an effort was
made to maroon a number of them at
the first European port touched.
Ford's plan, as nearly as it is pos
sible to put so intangible a thing on
paper, was to give the warring na
tions mental science treatment. Ford
himself at the outset had unbounded
iaith in his ability. Despite the
treatment attributed to him that he
intended to "get the boys out of the
trenches by Christmas," he did not
count on immediately ending the war.
Expected Large Following.
What Ford did believe was that he
could "make a dent" by gathering
about him a whole ship's company,
uniting the members' minds on one
"big thought of peace" and continu
ally adding to the volume and in
tensity of this thought as he and his
crusaders traveled from neutral coun
try to neutral country, on the edge
of the zone of war, or even in the
zone itself
Much Quarreling.
Whether this plan would have
succeeded under favorable circum
stances can't be stated, because the
peace delegates failed to concentrate
on thoughts of peace. The Oscar
Ii's voyage from New York to Chris
tiania was horrible, not so much be
cause of the incessant quarreling as
on account of the atmosphere of sus
picion and malice after the first day
or two out. Ford Takes to Cabin.
Ford speedily took to his cabin and
for more than half the trip was
hardly seen by any but his closest ad
visors. He was ill, it was stated. The
nature of the illness never was made
clear. Several of the correspondents
whom the expedition's managing
committee was trying to separate
from the party did see the patient
for a few minutes the night before
the Oscar II's arrival at Christiania.
It is true that he looked like a sick
man, but his malady seemed rather
of the spirit than the body.
Appeared in Trance.
Ford moved and spoke like a per
son in a semi-trance. He seemed al
most completely broken. Early in
the voyage he declared that squab
bling among the peace delegates was
a small matter, that disagreements
were to be expected in any commu
nity, and that when the party landed
at Christiania these troubles would
quickly disappear. On this night,
however his manner suggested that
he realized the fundamental weakness
of his organizationthat he had lost
hope.
Hopes on Faith.
While Ford admitted that he based
his early hopes only on faith, Mmme.
Rosika Schwimmer declared she had
written assurances from officials of
all the neutral European govern
ments that they would welcome such
an effort as the one undertaken by
Ford and from men in high positions
at the chancellories of certain of the
warring nations "on both sides" that
they were at least not unfriendly to
the plan.
Denies Statement.
The second day of the party's stay
in Christiania, Premier Knudsen of
Norway denied the "truth of her
statement. Numerous cables received
in Christiania from Mmme. Schwim
mer, addressed to peace organizations
and discussing arrangements for the
Ford party's reception and for co
operation in peace work, still lay in
the Christiania telegraph office be
cause there were no such organiza
tions to deliver them to. Those who
opposed Mmme. Schwimmer assert
at 5 he had thus deceived Ford con
cerning the strength of peace senti
ment in Scandinavia.
Press Has Grievances.
Mmme. Schwimmer boasted that
she had a "dossier" of every person
on the ship and that not a word was
said which she did not know of al
most immediately. There were many
