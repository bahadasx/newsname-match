MAKING A RECORD
Methods by Which a Phonograph
Disk Is Produced.
CATCHING THE SOUND WAVES.
They' Ara First Imprisoned In Wax and
Then Transferred to a Negative In
Copper, and From This Master Mold
the Records Art Obtained.""
The Edison phonograph, the grapho
phono type perfected by Bell and Tain
ter and the gramophone type by Ber
liner are all based on substantially the
aino principle. Sound wares set up in
the air by any sound are allowed to
strike a delicately hold diaphragm,
which vibrates under the Impact of the
souud waves, The vibrations are made
to leave a record j on a suitable me
dium, and this sound record Is used to
perform tfcs inverse operation when it
is required to reproduce recordod
sounds that is, the record is made to
vibrato a sensitive diaphragm and Vet
up in the air particular waves, which
convey to ; tho ear the impression of
sound, . - -."". : '
; The differences in the systems are in
the way in which the vibrations are re
corded. The disk record, which mado
the, machine popular, wns first manu
factured In the United States in 1ST.
Improvements in the machine and in
the needles followed.
To make a gramophone record a per
son sings before 1 ho mouth of aiiom,
the object of .which is to concentrate
tlio energy of the 'sound waves upon
the recording dlupha'm.. At the nar
row end of the horn Wro the recording
sound box and the machine With its
attendant expert There is n screen
between singer and operator to guard
the secrets of the sound' box. On the
farther side of the screen 1 n hori
zontal table carrying a wax tablet
rotated teneatbj the-recording sound
box at a uniform speed, usually about
seventy-six revolutions per minute. As
the table rotates It travels laterally at
a uniform speed,, and, the, vynx, tablet
is thus caused., to travel slowly under
the stationary recording , box. The
sapphire cutting point is. lowered so
as to enter the wax three and oue-half
to four one-thousandths of nn inch, and
as the m.ichluo runs it cuts a fine spiral
groove, running from the edge to the
center. The construction of the sound
box la secret, ns ls'tbe composition of
the wax tablet . . r. nr. t, '
The next step In the process is the
reproduction of the record a a nejra:'
tlve In copper. The wax is dusted with'
graphite and worked into the grooves
with a badger brash to make' it elec-'
tro-conductlvcs then It is lowered Into
an electrolytic bath of copper salt solu
tion. Tlio wax is "kept in continuous
motion In the bath until the copper
shell is nine-tenths of a millimeter In
thickness.
This negative Is a master, and from
this a few commercial samples can be
pressed to test the quality of the rec
ord. The manufacturers, however.
wish to make thousands of copies
without, hurting their master: there
fore they make duplicates of their
master by taking impressions in wax
composition, from which working mat
rices are made. Then copper shelU
arc obtained from these in the same
way. The copper shell is then backed
by a brass plate one-half inch In thick
ness by soldering under pressure.
Then the matrix Is nickel plated on
the recorded sido In order to wear bet
ter and after polishing is; ready for
the pressing machine. Tbo commercial
record is pressed into some substance
hard at normal temperature and plastta
under heat and very hard and smooth.
Various compounds are employed by
different makers, but shellac is the
principal ingredient Shellac, wood
charcoal, heavy spar and earthy color-
iug matter in certain proportions are
used.
This compound after careful mixing
is rolled into thin sheets and divided
into sections, one for each record. The
section is then pressed by a hydraulic
press. The matrix is heated and placed
face up in a mold, the label is placed
face down on the matrix, and on this is
placed in a warm, plastic state enough
mntei'ial for one record. . Both halves
of the press are furnished with cooling
plntes, through which streams of -water
can be passed, and the surfaces are
cooled quickly. The record Is then re
moved, the e-!gcs trimmed with emery
wheels, and it is then ready for sate-

AN OLD PROVERB
. It used to be proverbial that every
man (and ib is certainty no less true
of women) is either a fool or a phy
sician at forty. This means that
every, intelligent person must lettrn
so much about caring for his own
health that by the time he is forty
years of ago he can almost be reck
oned as a physician.
Why, then, Is there so much talk by
doctors against "self -medication?" A
woman can recognize all ordinary ail
ments without calling on a dootor. If
they are ailments distinctive to her
sex she generally knows enough to
use that greatest of all remedies for
such ailments, Lydia E. Pinkham's

she is familiar with the standard rem
edies for other diseases,
HUDSON SUPER-SIX'
AUTO SENSATION
OF THTYEAR
Has Broken All Stock Car Records
Up to 100 Miles
the New Hudson -Super-Six Just
announced at the New York show
promises to be the biggest sensation
of the year even eight and twelve
cylinder development does not rival
in importance latest Hudson move-
present ideas of conventional auto
mobile engineers must ail be revised
in light of the New Hudson invention.
The new seven-passenger Hudson
Supor-Six, Just announced at tho New
York show has startled the motor
worm, rnis is not merely a new
model with minor refinements. It is
an absolute upheaval of all. present
impressions, and beliefs , regarding
motors, and particularly six-cylinder
motors. Even the rumor of the new
Hudson car has for months kept mo
tordom on edge. But the wildest ru
mor was tame compared to the truth.
Its builders claim that the Super-Six
begins a revolution and there seems
every reason to anticipate that their
belief is well founded. The heart of
the new Hudson Super-Six lies in the
motor, in which is comprehended a
new invention of Hudson engineers.
The motor is patented and the name
Super-Six la registered so that the full
benefit of the discovery belongs solely
to the Hudson company and to own
ers of Hudson cars.
Tho motor is no larger than last
year's motor, 3 x 5 inches, but the
power has .been increased by 80 per
cent. The best power heretofore ef
fectively produced by a six Cylinder
motor of this capacity -was about 45
horse power. The new Hudson Su
per-Six, effectively uses 76 horse pow
er, et the new motor is ' strictly
conventional in- every feature. It is
simply an advance on the present
typa of standard motor, with ; the ad
dition of the new discovery ofi the
Hudson engineers. This utilizes
more of "the developed , power,; The
motor develops about 8 horse power
as in old' type sixes, 'but owing to its
absolute; stndothuesii 1 and 'lack' of viW
ration,' less "than S horse power is
consumed within :the 'motor itself;
leaving !the immense 1 Thargin of '78
horSe power to ' be utilized in driving
the ar.-'-V' .''' '''T'- ..-!!:;...
he Super-Six in an official test on
the Sheepshead Bay Speedway under
the rules and supervision of the
American Automobile Association has
broken all stock car records up to 100
miles. This was done with a real
"stock" car. No change was made in
compression, in pistons, in valves,
camshaft, oiling system, timing or in
any other respect. The car was not
only standard in all details, but it had
a full 7-passenger body and equip
ment. This story of the achievement of
the Super-Six -seems almost unbeliev
able, yet it is certified by a represent
ative of the American Automobile As
sociation, and by the technical editor
of "Motor" who "were " official, ob
servers, Many tests ot various kinds
were made. With two passengers in
the car and with . windshield and top
in place, the .Super-Six ; made a re
cord of 10Q miles in . 80 minutes, 21.4
seconds, or an average speed: of 74.67
miles jer, houri j.uvn.i vii'
5 On a two mile, lap one complete cir
cuit of tho .track, its record, was 76.75
miles, per;,hoiuvb This was . adono not
once but several times. Many times
in succession it made records of a
mile in 1 minute and 33.4 seconds to
1 minute, 33.8 seconds, varying by the
fraction of a second. The clock-like
regularity was perfectly amazing to
all observers. .. .
With five passengers in the car and
with windshield and top up, it exceed
ed 73 miles per hour and averaged
over 70 miles in sixty minutes actual
running. . , ,
From a standing start, 50 miles
speed was obtained in 16 1-5 seconds
and from five miles an hour to 50
miles an hour in 19 2-5 seconds. This
on high gear.
Tho Hudson Super-Six dovelops the .
highest power . per cubic inch dis
placement of any automobile motor
ever built. The fuel consumption at
40 miles Is about the same as like
sized motors at 20 hiiles. The motor
runs as smoothly at low speeds as it
does at high speeds. This means
that the life of the motor is increased
due to its smoothness or lack of vib
ration. Therefore, this Is not a mo
tor that needs the usual overhauling
every season, misuse or accidents, of
course, excepted. The object of high
speed In the motor is not merely
high peed in the car. It can be util
ized for epeed if tho driver wishes,
but the fact that the motor is capable
of this highspeed insures power, flex
ibility, ease of control, quick acceler
ation and reservo capacity for diffi
cult roads or hills. It gives the abil
ity to creep at low speed on high
gear. The Hudson Super-Six can bo
driven at a walking pace on high
gear. It gives the ability to acceler
ate quickly, to climb hills on high
gear and to avoid changing gears.
The new car attains the luxury of
motion, the - client gliding at any
speed in a way . superior to anything
before known. Every reason for an
eight or twelve cylinder car has van
ishod, and no other car in either the
six or the four cylinder class is in the
slingbtest degree comparable to this
new Hudson.
In beauty, luxury and finish the
Hudson Company has done its best
to reach the apex in the new car,, both
in open and closed models of fyhich
there are six. It is a masterpiece of
beauty. The car has new body lines,
The radiator is higher. The line of
the car sweeps in an unbroken curve
direct from the radiator to the back
of the rear seat. The windshield is
slanted. The car has the dividing
cowl on the back of the front seat.
All the upholstery is in genuine grain
leather. No fabrio leather t is anj'i
where employed. The- wheel baso
has been increased to 125!'.,, There
is more room tham ever before, yet
the. car retains its low, . gracofnlj
racy appearance, so much desired..
A new vacuum feed system with
the supply tauk- in tho rear of the car.
and the feed tank beneath the eowl
has been developed specially fop tho
Hudson Super-Six.' Also a new-' car
buretor has been' developed which is
marvel of inventive skill. Only
one chassis is furnished for the Su
per-Six, but on this chassis are - built
six bodies, the phaeton, the touring
sedan, the cabriolet, the limousine,
the town car and the roadster. Prices
range from $1,375 for the phaeton to
$2,500 for the limousine and the town
car, these prices being f. o. b., De
troit. Durhig the last six months the cap
acity of the Hudson factory has been
practically doubled. The company
is now building almost every. part of
Its car in its own factory, ' ;
Demonstrators and sample"' cars
are already being shipped andr'every
assurance is given of prompt delivery
to buyers immediately after Feb. 1.
No one who wants a Hudson car1 will,
have to wait for it. The .'output for
the year will be 30,000 cars. " A great
er number of high grade cars than
ever before has been produced in the
history of the industry.
