mayor's proclamation follows:
Whereas, the president of the Unlt3d

idopted by the Senate of the United ;
States, has Issued a proclamation ap-,
jointing January 27, 1916, as a day
jpon which the people of the United

is they feel disposed for the aid of

And whereas, pursuant to said
proclamation, collections will be
