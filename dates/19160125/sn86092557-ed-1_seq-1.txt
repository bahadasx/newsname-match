Span the Ravine With Dou
ble Row of Substartial
Buildings.
1 BARGAIN BASEMENTS
Unique Suggestion , is Being
Given Much Considera
tion by Citizens.
An unique plan for solving the Coal
Run ravine problem was suggestetd to
the City commissioners yesterday af
ternoon at a meeting of the Board of
Affairs in a bridge and business block
drawing submitted by the Wilbur J.
Watson Engineering company.
According to the proposed plan, a
double row of substantial buildings
would be constructed in connection
with a concrete bridge across Coal
Run. On each side of the bridge would
be a row of buildings, or rather a sin
gle long building reaching from the
bottom of the ravine for a distance of
seven stories to the floor level of the
bridge and then above the bridge for
three stories.
The rooms on the level with the
bridge floor may be used for store
rooms, restaurants, motion picture
theaters and other such purposes. The
second and third stories above the
bridge floor level may be used forj
apartments.
The seven floors beneath the drive
way on the bridge would be suitable
for warehouses, wholesale houses and
'light manufacturing purposes, although
below the level of the br.idge floor they
would be well lighted and well ventila
ted because of the character of the
, ravine.
It has also been suggested that the
entire building on one side of the
bridge might be used for a big depart
ment store with seven "bargain base
ments."
Mayor Anthony Bowen points ou?
that in order to use the seven floors
of the proposed buildings'beneath the
driveway for warehouses7 and manu
facturing .purposes, it would, be ?necei*;J
sary to construct a railroad switch j
up the ravine which would mar the
beauty, causing the ravine to become j
an ugly hollow. # i
The plan has been suggested as a
substitute for a causeway which has
been under discussion for nearly a
year. It would of course be impractical
for the' city to go into the building
business for commercial purposes as
extensively as a project of this kind
would require. To erect a structure of
this kind across Coal Run', would re-1
quire more -tiy.n the mere cooperation
of abutting property owners and busi
ness men of-thejcity to carry it to
successful completion.

FREIGHT TRANSFER
HERE IS WRONG
Business Men Appeal to
Public Service Commis
sion for Relief.
The question of Interchange of
freight between the Monongahela Rail
way and tho Baltimore & Ohio Rail
way in Marion and nearby countlos
will be argued before the West Vir
ginia Public Service Commission Tues
day, February IB, according to a re
port received hero from Charleston
today.
Business men of Fairmont and Mor
gantown have asked the Public Service
Commission to arrange for a mora
economical and convenient Inter
change of car-load shipments of freight
originating on one road and billed to
destinations on the other.
It is pointed out that freight ship
ped on the Baltimore & Ohio railroad
by business men on the South S<de
and billed for shipment via tho Monon
gahela railway to Morgantown and
other cities In that, vicinity 1b, routed
to Leckroue, Pa., a distance of 100
miles where it is transferred to the
Monongahela road and shipped a dis
tance of 60 or 70 miles to its destina
tion; '
Local business men are asking that
instead of being sent to Leckrone for
transfer the freight be transferred at
Rivesvllle. By transferring at Rlvcs
ville the-total distance from point! of
origin In Fairmont to destination 'in
Morgantown or nearby, towns'. wduLL
be about SO miles Instead of 170 as u
must travel according the routing at
present, according to statements by
the petitioners.

AUNT HATT WAS THE DISCOVER
ER AND SHE SECURED AM
PLE PROOF.
Fair-view haB nothing on Falrmlait
when ft comes to harboring the early
robin. A real fat lire robin was seen
In this city on Gaston avenue yester
day morning. "Aunt Hatt," a negress
who has been a servant in the family
of John A. Clark for a long period
of years, saw the robin in the yard at
the back of the Clark home and called
other members of the family to ob
serve the phenomena so as to verify
tho fact that she had really seen the
feathered songster.
Persons crossing the ravine to the
South Side this morning were greeted
with a melody of'song, several differ
ent songsters adding their voices to
the stream of melody which floated
up from the ravine. While the birds
could not be distinguished their song
made known the fact that they were
there, and many persons stopped on
the bridge, entranced by their music.

which the authorities expect to make
in connection with this case. *

United States secret service men after
two .or- three months of sleuthing dis-l
covered . the place in that towir.where |

with which they stamped the bills.
Following this clue they picked'.""up*:
Harris;;,.,;?

tag watched , and other arrests are
expected at any--moment now. It is
the- general opinion that' the men' are
playing thie races at Juarez, Mexico,
