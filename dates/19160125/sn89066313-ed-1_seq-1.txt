nine postmen in a week handled a
total of 42,422 letters. Ilcsides these,
there were 307 special deliery let

The total weight of mail handled by
carriers last week was 15,240 pounds.
The total number of parcel post pack
ages delivered was -'.SOS. And, at
that, this month has been the lightest
since September.
The postoffice lias the same office
force that it had nine years ago and
only one more carrier than it had at
that time. The mail has more than
trebled, and the receipts have doubled.

(lid Picture .Shows. How Times Have
Chanu'ed at (iirls' College.
It is a far cry from an tntercol
legiate track meet to croquet, and so
is there a vast distance between the
1!1C bonnet and the unbonnet of
1S70. Stephens College, lionet er,
manages to reconcile these differ
ences by pointing to the ISt) per cent
increase in enrollment during the
last three years as ample evidence of
the superiority of track athletics over
croquet and present headgear over
the stinbonnet.
That the stinbonnet was an evei
present need In the uniform of tbe
student of the old days is shown by
a pho'ograph which hangs in the of
(ice of Stephens College. The stu
dents wore old-fashioned, full-skirted
dresses, with white sunbonnets. The
picture was taken while a croquet
game was being played. Each girl
had a mallet in her hand. A white,
board fence of Intricate design en
closed the plaers and school, which
was a much smaller building than that
of today.
The picture was gien to the col
lege by Jerrold It. Letcher, a gradu
ate of tlie University in 1S75, who
now lives in Salt Lake City. Mr.
Letcher was in school in 1870, at the
time the iilcturc was taken, and it
seems had a hobby for keeping such
things.
That times have changed a great
deal since then may be appreciated
when one considers the fact that the
Intercollegiate track meet of the
junior colleges of Missouri will be
held on the grounds of the croquet
field in the spring.

"Can't do it. I'm cramming for an
eam tomorrow !"
To cram or not to cram? That is
the question foremost in the mind of
c-inversiiy students this week. That
word, "cramming," is getting more
than its share of publicity these days.
Not only is it used by the student who
seeks an M grade but it is used by
the one who hopes for an E as well.
The decision is strongly in favor of
the positive side of the question; the
verdict is "to cram " All roads lead
to tlie library. The University stu
dent thinks of preparedness when the
time conies to use it. About even
chair in the library has been occupied
each evening this week.
Busv" signs decorate the doors of
those who find that cramming can be
carried on better within their own
rooms. Social events, too, are given
up. Tom has no time for Jane, and
Jane has no time for Tom. Exams,
are here, and both are busy if an oc
casional freshman fails to undei stand
the significance of the word "cram
ming." a thoughtrul upperclass broth
er or sister is at hand to give an in
sight into its significance.
Here's niiat Webster Sajs.
According to Webster, "cramming"
is "hastily acquired and undigested
knowledge." Tlie vvoid has begun to
lose its original meaning and is often
considered slang. Whatever scruples
the University students may have in
this regard, the majority of them are
willing to acknowledge that they have
crammed. Even the Phi lleta Kappa
member vouches without hesitancy
that he, too, has stooped to the level
or the average student in this regard
University professois disagree as to
the merits and demerits of cramming
All make a specific distinction between
cramming and general review work.
Cramming is or very little practi
cal service," sas Dr. A. H. It. Fair-
child, professor of English. "One usu
ally forgets what is crammed and also
loses the real value of the knowledge
he is supposed to acquire. Tlie one
possible virtue of cramming is that an
intensive and rapid review gives a
perspective and allows the student to
see the subject as a whole."
"Honest Worker Doesn't Xeed It."
According to Prof. AValter Miller,
dean of the Graduate School, the stu
dent who has dono work honestly
doesn't need to cram and the other
student can't make up his lack in
cramming before an examination. "A
student is better off with a good
night's sleep and a clear head." he
savs.
Dr. J. W. Hudson of the philosophy
department believes in cramming. "A
student gets a good summary of the
course and is better able to make a
good grade by getting the facts togeth
er. Students work for grades, and
these are the symbol of scholarship."
Dr. Max F. Meyer, professor of psy
chology, says: "For some persons
cramming is an excellent thing; for
others it is torture. It depends on
what a person goes to school for. If
to be a better citizen and become more
efficient socially, then cramming will
do him no good; if to become an ora
tor then cramming of knowledge and
memory work is what he needs."
Favors JkUIicr a General Review.
"I do not believe In cramming," sajs
F. F. Stephens, assistant professor of
history. "It takes the place of work
that should he done during a s:mcster
A general review of the course i3 all
right, but I do not approve of cram
ming." Acording to Jacob Warshaw, assist
ant professor of Romance languages,
there are two kinds of crammini. With
a good student, cramming is an in
tensive study for a purpose. Ir a pcor
student, it is an obligation. In good
students it has the value of getting de
tails combined in correct proportion.

FOK i:vv J'lTl PLAN IX SEDAI.IA
Has Plan for Iti-Henm-nt
of Public Taste.
Mrs. Cora G. I,evvis of Kinsley, Kan.,
who made several addresses in Co
lumbia during Farmers' Week, be
lieves that she has a remedy for the
sort of music that doesn't captivate
while poor Pauline is perili.ing on
me movie screen. The Kansas editor
advocates a strict censorship of movie
music just like that applied to dims.
Mrs. Lewis explained the plan to a
women's club in Kansas City Satui-
day. .Mrs. Lewis contended that the
"stuff" that's what she calls movie
music tended to keep grown-ups
from forming a taste for worth-while
music.
More censors would mean more ex
pense, Mrs. Lewis said, but if they
were the right kind or censors the
attendance at motion picture theaters
would be larger and people would not
object, because they would be getting
something in return.
How can we expect fathers and
mothers, especially the fathers, to be
come interested in good music?"
argued -Mrs. Iewis. "When they hear
the average ragtime, they won't listen
to argument that their children should
be taught real music in the grade
schools. Start the child in the subject
of music just like reading, writing and
arithmetic."
Mrs. Lewis said that she would take
up the censorship proposal with state
educators in Kansas.
Hoard Awards Piiblisliin

Tlie E. W. Stephens Publishing
Company has been awarded the con
tract for publishing the reports of the
Missouri Supreme Court and of the
Court of Appeals. The company has
been publishing the leports on its

The act or the Legislature under which
the contracts were awarded was pass
ed so that the state might exercise
supervision over the matter and print
ing or the reports.
The S!ephens bid, which won the
appioval or the board, consisting or
Secretary or State Roach, Auditor
Gordon and Attorney General Barker,
was $1.38 a volume for current
volumes to the state and public, the
same figures on volumes S3 to 2.C,
the plates of nh.'ch are in the hands
of the company, and $2 a volume on
volumes 1 to S2, plates of which are in
the hands or another company. 12.
Sidney Stephens, secretary and treas
urer of the tompaiiy, this nioriiini; es
timated that during tlie six years the
contract runs the state will pur
chase $25,000 in books.
The only other bid was tlie Missouri

ico, Mo., at $1.15 a volume for cur
rent reports but with no bid to supply
volumes prior to December 22, 191
J lie new price, which averages
$1.50 a volume, will save lawyers,
who are the chief users, $1 a volume
on all reports published up to this
time," said Mr. Stephens. "The old

The bride and groom are each 17

tralia, who is in Columbia today t.)
conrer with Dean Walter Willia-iu on
plans foi the next meeting of the
Press Congress of the World, to be
held in Sydney in April. 191S.
"It is diilicult for me to sav what
has impressed me most in America,"
said Captain Xiesigh. "At first 1 re
ceived a new impression everv
lay. 1 see something different in ev
ery city I visit. However. I believe
that the general immensity or your
undertakings has impressed me most
for instance, tlie building or the West

"The Americans surpass the Austra
lians in one respect at least," eoi-
ceded Captain Xiesiah. "Tl eivlr.

lievable. I know- they have squabbles
among themselves, but when the time
comes for eoneentrate.1 effort they get
together and cver;-LoiL boosts. I
could not help observing tills boosting
spirit that existed i:no:it; San Fran
cisco people at the time the exposi
tion opened."
Captain Xiesigh does not insist that
you listen to war tall- or hear Hug
land's side ot tlie sto -y. Ho does say.
however, that the A.istraian people
possess almost mo: visible, genuine.
ponlaneous and lasting loyalty and
patriotism than exitu in London. And
to prove his statement he reminds you
or the way the Aust.'alians hive gone
to the rront in cli-f.'.is,- n the Hritisn
L'mpire.
"And they will fis,ht until the last
enemy gun is laid down," he savs
Australia is a country as large as
the I'nited States, although its popu
lation is only about 1 aff as large as
that or the state of Xew York.
Increase in Australian Trade.
Captain Xiesigh tol.l not.- Australia
had been advancing in Industry and
commerce during the last few years,
mentioning especially the vast in
crease in trade between Sm Francis
co and Australia. He had figures or the
custom house or San Francisco which
showed that in I'.ii:. imports from Aus
tralia received in that port amounted
to $990,000, while the exports from
the San Francisco port to tlie Antipo
des amounted to $3,29,000. Accord
ing to the report or 191.", the imports
rrom Australia had increased to $6,
500,000 and the exports from the Unit
ed States to S7.20S.000.
"And this is just the record of jne
port," he pointed out.
Captain Xiesigh, as president or the
Australian Journalists' Association in
1912-'13-'14, was one or the authors of
the plan which established a minimum
wage for editorial employes or news
papers. Australia is the only coun
try in the world in which such a p'an
has been worked out.
Captain Xiesigh is a retired army
ollieer, having served in the Austra
lian army for several years.
A luncheon was given in his honor
