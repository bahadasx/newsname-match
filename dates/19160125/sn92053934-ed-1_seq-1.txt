NOTE TO BRITAIN
OPPOSES ACTIONS
Washington, Jan. 25. Vigorous op
position to Great Britain's "trading
with the enemy act" is lodged in rep
resentations the United States is
sending the British foreign office. The
communication has been prepared for
transmission following the receipt of
the text of the act from Ambassador
Page. Although the representations
do not take the form of a protest for
the reason that the act is limited in
its immediate application to British
subjects, strenuous objection is di
rected against any attempt to apply
the legislation to American trade.
The United States contends that the
proposed interference with trade is
illegal and that it would be next to im
possible to successfully aim a blow
at Germany without doing grave in
justice to American commerce.

GOURT'SDEGISION
OVER INCOME TAX
JPENSWAYTOACT
v :
Washington, Jan. 25. Legislation to
increase governmental revenues to
meet the expenses of national defense
is expected to take definite shape now
that all doubt as to the constitution
ality of the income tax has been re
moved by the supreme court's deci
sion. Congressional leaders had
taken no definite steps toward a solu
tion of the revenue problem pending
the court's decision.
Leaders expressed the belief today
that the decision' had paved the way
for increasing the tax rate on great
private fortunes to aid In paying for
national defense. Bills to tax in
comes of more than $1,000,000 as high
as 50 per cent are now before con
gress. The democrats are gratified over the
decision. In the opinion of adminis
tration leaders the decision has un
fettered a fruitful source of revenue
and rendered easier the revenue prob
lem confronting the government.

Paris, Jan. 25, (8:15 a. m.)
The Serbian towns of Monastir
and Gievgeli have again been at
tacked by a squadron of French
aeroplanes, 16 in number, the Ath
ens correspondent of the Havas
agency telegraphs. It is estimat
ed ltS persons were killed or
wounded at GievgeU.
Paris, Jan. 25-AIl the French
aeroplanes returned In safety. In
some cases they covered a dis
tance of 190 miles.
Berlin, Jan. 25, (by wireless to Say
villa, N. Y.) The assertion is again
made today by the Overseas News
Agency that the Montenegrins have
laid down their arms, offering no re
sistance. "The newspapers of Berlin," the
news agency says, "state that the trav
els and utterances of King Nicholas
are less important than the fact that
all of Montenegro is now occupied by
Austro-Hungarian troops, which no
where encountered resistance. The
only disorders were at Podgoritza, and
in that case the fighting was between
Montenegrins and Albanians, who en
gaged in riots in the streets until Aus-tro-Hungarian
troops were summoned
by the Montenegrins to restore or
der." The newspapers state further that
the main body of Montenegrin troops
laid down its arms and that the Nik
sic, Danilovgrad, Podoritza Scutari
line is firmly in the hands of the Aus-tro-Hungarians.
Peace Request Still Stands.
"Neither King Nicholas nor the
Montenegrin government withdrew the
request which they made for peace,
and the capitulation has actually taken
place. The newspapers express the
opinion that King Nicholas went to
France at the request of the entente
powers, especially because of the Im
pression made in these countries by
the surrender of Montenegro."
Rome, Jan. 24, (3 p. m.) Active
guerrila warfare is being waged by
the Montenegrin troops on their re
treats southward, and particularly in
the Tarabosch mountain west of Scu
tari, according to reports received
! here today.
I In the advance of the Austrian
; troops who are in pursuit a number
: of Austrian aeroplanes have been har
; assing the Montenegrins, flying low
; and using machine guns against
groups of the poorly equipped soldiers
of General Martinovitch.
Spanish Army Active.
Paris, Jan. 24, (6:05 p. m.) Gen
eral Valeriano Weyler has been 'ap
pointed president of a central general
staff of the Spanish army which has
just been created by a royal decree.
according to a dispatch from Madrid
to the Havas agency.
General Weyler was governor of
Cuba just before the Spanish-American
war and his policy of severity in
waging war on the revolutionary
movement and particularly his action
in forcing the concentration of the
rural population in certain sections
have generally been regarded as hav
ing had much to do with the bringing
about of that war.
I After his return to Spain his reputa
i tlon as an iron handed soldier brought
j him appointments to positions where
stern measures seemed to be required.
His appointment in 1900 as captain
general of Madrid resulted in more
than one ministerial crisis. He was
minister of war in 1901 and again in
1905. In 1909 he was appointed captain-general
of Catalonia with head
quarters at Barcelona, where the dis
turbances connected with the execu
tion of the sentence of death on Fran
cisco Ferrer were quelled by him
without bloodshed.
It was recently announced that the
Spanish government had decided to
reorganize its entire army system and
the appointment of General Weyler to
the newly created position to president
of a central general staff is an Indica
tion that the veteran soldier, who is
in his 77th year continues to be a pow
er in the military service of Spain.

company from Athens says that the
sultan's yacht Erthogroal, according
to reports from Constantinpole, was
torpedoed in the Bosphorus by a
French submarine in the latter part of
December. The vessel was seriously,
damaged. '
The same dispatch states that Field
Marshal Baron Kolmar von.der Goltz
has been appointed commander in
chief of the Turkish forces in the Cau
casus. The Turkish Imperial yacht Ertho
groal was built at Elswlk in 1903, is
206 feet long and has an armament of
eight 3-pounders.
TRYING TO MAKE
PROMISES GOOD
El Paso, Texas, Jan. 25. Efforts
are being made by the Carranza gov
ernment of Mexico, according to to
formation made public here today to
establish the land reforms promised
by the constitutionalists. Andreas
Garcia, Mexican consul here, said thai
a commission already had been ap
pointed to put into operation that
Carranza land distribution scheme,
which contemplates the return to gov
ernment control of municipal lands
taken by private parties during and
after the Diaz regime. When this is
accomplished, it is said, the Carranza
government will divide the vast areas.
of uncultivated lands comprising
some of the largest estates in Mexico.
Soldiers who have fought for Carran
za will share first in this distribu
tion of small farms, it is announced.
Latest advices concerning Gendral
Villa stated that he was in the vi
cinity of Guerrero, where, according
to statements by his supporters, h
was safe from pursuing Carranza,
forces, pending completion of his
plans to reorganize an army to take
the field, with Argumendo and other
leaders, against the de facto govern
ment. REPUBLICAN LEADER

Lansing Scans Final Docu
ment in Long Interna

PRESENTED BY COUNT
Ambassador Von Bernstorff
Delivers Paper From the
Berlin Government.
London, Jan. 25, (3:02 p. m.)
The British government has or
dered that a formal investigation
be made of the circumstances
attending the sinking of the ,
steamship Persia in the Mediter
ranean last month.
Washington, Jan. 25. Secretary
Lansing had before him today anoth
er written proposal from Germany
designed to bring about a settlement
of the controversy to the sinking of
the liner Lusitania. It was submitted
through Ambassador von Bernstorff.
Although secrecy surrounds the
negotiations, it was indicated today
that the proposal might result in a
satisfactory ending to the long stand
ing negotiations on the subject.
Is Last Proposal.
It is understood that in the latest
proposal Germany has agreed to
eliminate from the text of the agree
ment any mention of the warning ia-''
sued by the Germany embassy when
the Lusitania sailed and left out her
general reservation of admission of
wrong doing on the part of her sub
marine commander. These two points,
it is understood, were contained in
previous proposals and were stren
uously objected to"6y President Wil
son. It was also said that the Berlin
government makes some reference to
a desire to see this country take ac
tion in regard to questions involv
ing the freedom of the seas. Germany,
it is said, reiterates that the tor
pedoing of the Lusitania was an act
of reprisal for the British blockade of
the German coast. Regret is express
ed for the loss of American lives and
indemnity is offered.
Attentiqn is called to the fact that
such forms of reprisal have been dis
continued as the result of negotia
tions with the United States.
Secretary Lansing's only comment
today on the published description of
Germany's latest proposal was that
it was "speculation not Justified by
the facts."
Mr. Lansing, It was said, will have
a separate conference with President
Wilson on the latest turn in the ne
gotiations. ROADS HAMPERED
