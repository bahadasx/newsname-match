Inspecting Officers, Who Return to Hono
lulu Tonight Events Closed With Banquet
In Uhue Last Night at Which Armories
were Assured.
The tour of Kauai by Brigadier
' General Samuel I. Johnson and
Colonel C. S. Lincoln, N. G. H.,
will come to a close at 5 o'clock
this afternoon when both officers
will depart in the steamer Maui
for Honolulu.
The visit of the officers was for
the purpose of officially inspecting
the newlv organized companies of
the National Guard, a work which
was fully accomplished; and the
officers are leaving feeling satisfied
that the local situation is in satis
factory shape.
The last notable function i n
connection with the tour was the
banquet given Jbv the officers of
the Knuai battalion to the visiting
officers at the Hotel Fail view last
night. This affair was informal
in a way, but was quite pleasant
throughout.
The table was arranged ijn a
shape ot a huge L, at the angle 'of
which were seated iGencral John
son, Colonel Lincoln. Major Broad
J lien t and other officers. H. D.
Wishard, chairman of the Board
of Supervisors, occupied one end
of the table, and Captain W. H.
Rice, Jr., the other.
After the Jjanquet had been un
derway some little time, Major
Broadbent arose, made a few in
troductory remarks and then turn
ed the program over to General
Johnson. T h c General himself
was the first speaker, expressing,
among other things, the pleasure
felt by him on account of the sue
cessful organization of the Kauai
companies. Colonel Lincoln was
the next speaker, and was follow
ed by Hon. A. S. Wilcox, who
made a practical address stating
that he was heartily in sympathy
with the National Guard and its
success and was sorry he was not
young enough to enlist himself,
Rev. Hans Iseuberg spoke of
his own military training when a
very young nian in Germany and
dwelt at length upon the desirabili
ty of the training for young men
Manager Frank Alexander said
he was much pleased with the
work that had been done at his
plantation in the matter of getting
a serviceable company together,
and had given Captain Cooper in
structions to proceed with plans
for the construction of a suitable
armory for the men. The armory
would be a matter to be realized in
the very near future,
Chairman Wishard made a few
remarks on behalf of the supervi
sors, speaking of steps which had
been taken in the direction of se
curing land back of the county
building for an armory. There
would, he thought, probably be no
trouble about this.
Supervisor McBryde spoke along
much the same lines, and added
that he thought the people of the
island of Kauai would be willing
to spend a part of their money to
help out the Guard.
Senator Rice followed, express
ing hearty endorsement o f the
Guard and promising it all the
sujji ort in his power.
Representative Coney followed,
speaking more particularly of the
Hawaiians with respect to the
Guard. He said he believed in
THE N. 0. H.
the Hawaiians joining for many
reasons and lost no opportunity to
advise young Hawaiians to enlist.
Gaylord Wilcox, manager of
Makee Sugar, Company, also made
few remailfs, expressing his
hearty sympathy with the Nation
al Guard, afteriewhioh officers of
the companies responded.
Colonel Lincoln arose the second
time and spoke directly to the civi
lians present-principallv the men
of large affairs; and urged their
undivided support of the Guard on
Kauai. Armories should be .con
structed without delay, and the
companies should have all the sup
port they may require, until they
are firmly, established, and in the
future. His reniaaks were listen
ed tc with particular interest.
Colonel Lincoln also brought
up the matter of club quarters, etc.,
for enlisted men, which he regard
ed .is of considerable importance;
and tirged that such be provided.
The matter of forming a regi
ment on Kauai was referred to by
several of the sneakers, and the
proposition seemed to be generally
favored, It was pointed out that
with two more companies, a full
regiment might be formed immedi
ately. In this connection, the
place cards on the table bori1 the
legend "4th. Regiment, N. G.
H." the suggestion being that
Maui's contigent should b e in
creased and niade the 3rd. Regi
ment and Kauai's regiment made
the 4th. The idea seemed to please
everybody.
For the occasion the dining hall
of the Fairview had been beauti
fully decorated with palms, "ferns,
etc., under the supervision of Cap
tain W. H. Rice. Tr. A huRe
American flag was suspended a
cross the center of the banquet
hall.
During the talk of Mr. Isenberg.
that gentleman referred to the Li-
hue armory and gave assurances
that a suitable structure would be
put up.
Major Broadbent capped off this
subiect by suggesting to General
Johnson that copies of plans for
other armories be sent up as quick
ly as possible.
Brigadier-General Samuel I.
Johnson and Captain H. S. Liu
coln.'U. S. A., brevetted colonel

"hardtimes" party, It was a n
unique affair and was carried out
with pleasing variations, all vot
ing it one of the most enjoyable
of the season's numerous func
tions. A great ileal of care and tact
were employed in the decorations
and arrangement of the house it
self, the reception areas being re
plete with reminders of the "hard
times" incident to sugar at 4.747
through which Kauai is passing.
Some of the "hardtimes" rai
ment schemes were extremely
clever, while all were good.
The program throughout was
enjoyed by everyone and all re
gretted when the hour came to
disperse.
The freighter Hvades will be

From Waimea the inspecting
party moved to Eleele where Com

IHE BREAKWATER
At the request of the President
of the Kauai Chamber of Com
merce, Raymo id C. Brown, sec
retary of the committee on perma
nent organization o f the recent
Civic Convention, has sent cables'
to Washington, calling attention
to the recent wrecks at this island
and referring to them as arguments
for the proposed new breakwater.
Of the matter the Honolulu Star
Bulletin of yesterday's date says:
Urging that an appropriation be
put through for a breakwater at
Nawiliwili harbor, Kauai. Ray
mond C. Brown, secretary of the
committee on resolutions of the
last civic convention, has cabled to
Stephen N. Sparkman, chairman
of the committee on rivers and
harbors in the house of representa
tives. Resolutions passed by the civic
convention last September were
forwarded to Washington several
weeks ago by Mr. Brown, but the
cable message was sent at request
of the Kauai Chamber of Com
merce. A similar message was
sent to Delegate J. K. Kalauiana
ole. Using as a special argument the
troubles that have beset vessels on
the Kauai coast during the recent
storms, Mr. Brown pointed out in
his message that a breakwater at
Nawiliwili would have given a har
bor for all vessels to put in, and
thus have prevented damage.
Fred Patterson, a young lawyer
now in the office of E. C. Peters,
at Honolulu, will arrive on Kauai
in a few days for the purpose of
locating permanently. It is as
sumed that he will "hang out his
shingle" in Lihue.

IHE SUGAR FI6HI
AT WASHINGTON
The following letter was rtceiv
ed by the editor of Tint Gakdhn
Island this m o r n i n g from
Washington:
January 7, 1916.
Dear Sir:
I have thought the enclosed cor
respondence that has passed be
tween Congressmen Martin, o f
Lusiana, and Congressmen Ford-
ney, of Michigan, would be of es-
tecial interest to the domestic
sugar producers at this juncture.
I have, therelore. lost no time in
issuing it in citciilar form.
I am also enclosing cer tain of
ficiul document hi wing upon the
sugar situation tuw before Con
gress, which will doublles.s prove
of inteiest to mi. These include!
Secretary McAdoo's teply to Sen-1
ate Resolution No. .21, introduced
by Senator Goic. which has pro
duced n j.reai i'kiI of discussion
throughout the country, inasmuch
as it is an i'tdicalinu that an effort
may possibly be afetnpted by a
certain element in Congress to im
pose a consumption tax upon the
domestic sugar ciop.
I also enclose copies of two re
solutions introduced bv Senator
Broussard, of Louisiana. The first
of these provides for a continua
tion of the present Underwood
rates on sugar by repealing the
Free Sugar Clause of. the Tariff
Act.
The other provides for the trial
of the Louisiana case by the Unit
ed States Supreme Court. If this
is authorized by Congress and Jthe
case is won, it would automatical
ly restore the Payne-Aldrich rates
on sugar.
Yours very truly,
Paul J. Christian.

KOREAN
SUICIDES
ABOVE HANAPEPE
Kim Soon, a Korean, took off
his clothes near the site of the old
school house, above the bridge, in
Hanapepe Saturday morning and
jumped into the river,
He could not swim. Sunday
morning the body was discovered
on the surface of the water near
the point at which the man had
taken his fatal plunge.
A coroner's jury was empanelled
by Deputy Sheriff Blake on Sun
day, viewed the body and return
ed a verdict of suicide.
A somewhat amusing incident
developed from the affair. The
body, it appears, was taken over
to one of the laborer's camps at the
Makaweli side. A citizen became
excited about it, and, getting a
wrong account, telephoned the
police that a man had been killed
in the camp, There was a second
scurrying of the minions of the law
and preparation for another coro
ner's inquiry. When the police
arrived at the camp, however, they
found the quite calm and peace
ful remains of the Korean who
had previously taken the water
route to glory in Hanapepe river,
