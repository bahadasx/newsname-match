British Mail Censorship Dis-
closes that Teutons Have
Been Sending Much Mer
chandise as First Class Stuff.
ARTICLES DESTINED
MOSTLY TO AMERICA
British Have Not Bothered the
United States Mail to Any
Extent, as Yet Hope This
Country will Attend to it.
i i
LONDON. Jan. 24. The British
censorship of first class mail to and
from Germany has resulted in the dis
covery that Germany has beea main
taining considerable , export trade
with neutrals in such articles as jew
elry, chemicals, laces, . pictures and
toys. They have been sent via
Sweden, Denmark or Holland. The
packages intercepted had been mark
ed "samples, no value".
One of the British censors showed
the Associated Press correspondent
articles worth $1,000 which had been
seized. Most of them were addressed
to South American poin's, the inten
tion apparently being to maintain
Germany's hold on foreign markets.
It is also stated a large quantity .
of contraband, destined for Germany
via Scandinavian ports from neutral
countries, ha.d been .apprehended.
Anti-British propaganda in the shape
of documents weighing thousands of
pounds has also been seized. These
were printed in many languages. They
were destined fror South America,
India, United States and other parts
of the world. It is stated that first
class mails to and from the United
States have not been inspected to 'a
great extent thus far. The attitude
of the government is that the United
States mail should not be molested.
It is suggested that an advanced cen
sorship in the United -States or lait
going mail would be welcomed so it
would oviate the necessity of any ac
tion by England.
AEROPLANE DATA GIVEN.
LONDON, Jan. 24. The Parliament
under-secretary of war announced ..in
the 'House of Commons that in the
course of the last four weeks thirteen
British aeroplanes were lost on west
ern front and that nine or ten Ger
man machines bad been brought
to the ground.
The under-secretary' said in' the
same period the British had employed
138 machines, while the Germans used
twenty. The number of British aero
planes which crossed the German
lines was 1,227 he haid. while three
of the . ten German machines crossec
the British lines. It is said aerial
battles had occurred over and behind
the German lines. Owing to the
westerly winds the Gernran machines,
if hit, planed down to : their lines,
which the British were unable to do.
PASSED THIRD READING.
LONPON.Jaa. 24. The military

the House of Commons by a vote of
383 to 36.
' The bill was immediately sent to
the House of Lords and given first
reading. The second reading will be
given Wednesday. Parliament will
probably be prorogued Friday. The
fact that the minority against the bill
Is virtually a third of that on first

Asquitb and Bonar-Law.

INCOME TAX IS
Supreme Court Unanimously
Decides that Famous Law is
!Nin Accordance with Consti
tution. -
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24. The in
come tax was declared constitutional
by the supreme court by unanimous
derision. In the opinion of congress
ional leaders, the way is opened for
increasing tax rate on great fortunes
to help pay for national defense.
- Proposals are pending in Congress
to tax incomes of more than a million
as high as fifty per cent. Leaders on
all sides agree that a great impetus is
given by the decision to such propos
als and there is likely t0 come a defi
nite movement to levy, on great pri
vate fortunes for some millions which
the government must raise to carry
out army and navy increases.
Representative Hull, author of the
law, said he believed Congress woula
take advantage of the opportunity and
amend the law so it will yield J1S5.
000.000 a year Instead of 85 or 90.000.
000, as at present. Hull is preparing

increases In those exceeding J 20.000 a
