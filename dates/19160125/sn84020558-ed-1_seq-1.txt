WASHINGTON. Jan. 24. Arrival of
the Italian steamship Verona, in New
York today, with two guns mounted at
her stern probably will result in the
Austro-Hunsarian government taking
up diplomatically with the United
States all the broad questions involved
in the arming of merchant ships for
defensive purposes.
It was indicated tonight that Baron
Zwiedinek, charge of the Austro-Hun-garian
embassy here, would inform his
government promptly of the arrival of
the Verona, if he had not already doiu
so, and that he would call upon Sec
retary Lansing in the near future to
determine the position of the United
States, in regard to permitting the
Jiner to sail with the guns mounted.

It proposes that voters cast their
ballots as heretofore. The candidate

to the American military authorities
here today, a request that a United

punished for having fired on and
wounded a Mexican civilian last Sat

for the manioc of Bert .Akers, an
American killed last Friday while
seeking to recover stolen cows from
a ranch in the vicinity of San Lo
renzo, a few miles below the
boundary.
Mexican officials at Juarez said
they hoped prompt action would be
taken by the American authorities,
as there was apparent in Juarez a
pronounced feeling resulting from the
execution of the two Mexicans for the
killing of one American, and the
shooting of the civilian. Alejandro
Soto, by the United States soldier,
Harrison, last Saturday.
According to the Mexicans, Soto
was shot while aiding a Carranza
soldier to water some horses in the
Kio Grande river. A preliminary in
vestigation already made by army of
ficers on this' side is said to have
shown that Soto was on American
territory and armed at the time. He
is said to have defied the soldier
and threatened to use his own rifle
when Harrison opened fire, shooting
twelve times. A doubt waj expressed
also that Soto had been wounded.
General Gavira said that Soto's wound
was superficial. Harrison is held in
confinement.
Collector Cobb reported to Wash
ington today that the Carranza au-
injured thorities were doing everything pos-
i sible to aid Americans. He was ad

A jury was secured in the district
court here this afternoon for the trial
of Elfego Baca, an Albuquerque,
N. M., lawyer, charged with the
killing of Celestino Otero. The trag
edy occurred in Kl Paso, Texas, Jan
uary 31, 1!I15, and it has been charged
that it was the outgrowth of a con
spiracy to release the Mexican Gen
eral Jose Ynez Salazar from the Al
buquerque jail, where he was waiting
trial in the federal court.
Baca, who acted as Salazar's at
torney, together with a number of
New Mexico citizens, was recently ac
quitted of the charge of conspiracy
in connection with the jail break. Mrs.

SERVICE BILL
PASSES COMMONS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONIxiN, Jan. 24. The military
service hill passed the third reading in
the house of commons tonight by a
vote of 383 to 36.
The hill was immediately sent to the
house of lords and given its first read
ing. The second reading will be taken
in the house of lords Wednesday and
parliament probably will be prorogued
Friday.
The fact that the minority against
the bil) was unconstitutionally only a
third of that on its first reading is
onsidered a great triumph for Pre-
mi -T Asquith and for Andrew Bonar
I.aw, who directed its course, and al
though tonight's debate showed that
many labor members are still Suspici
ous, there is n, doubt that general op-
P sition to tlie measures has dimin
ished enormously since its introduc
tion and that the feeling of the coun
try is strongly with the government.
Mr. Bonar-Law in his speech wind
ing up the debate, remarked on the
wonderful change since the first read
ing of the hill, which he said was a
compromise between those who
thought that it went not far enough
ind those who believed it went too far.

CLIFTON STRIKE ENDS
WHEN MINERS ACCEPT
THE MANAGERS' TERMS
Over Five Thousand .Men,
Out Since September 11,
Are Expected to Return

lowing Vote' Taken
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
CLIFTON. Ariz., Jan. 24 The strike
of ,1,000 miners in the three copper
distracts of Clifton, Morenci and Met-
calf, Arizona, which began September
11 last, was definitely terminated to
night when the former employes of
the three operating concerns, the Ar
izona, Detroit and S hannon Conner
companies, voted unanimously to re-1
turn to work under the proposition of-!
fered by the managers of the three
companies on January S. operations,
suspended since the strike began,
probably will be resumed next week.
Under this proposition. the com
panies recognize no union, but will
introduce a sliding scale of pay. under
which the miners will receive, at Ihe
present price of copper. $3.41 per day.
Carpenters will be paid $.1 per day.
machinists and hoilermakcrs $.1.31 and
laborers $2.10. A grievance committee
will meet the mine managers once a
month to discuss and adjust gricv
a nces.
It developed today that the strike,
which was called by Gnv Miller, an
organizer for the Western Federation '
of Miners, was not authorized by that!
organization and that no assessments
ever were levied by that or any other
organization for the support of the
strikers. Financial assistanccwas ren- :
dered only by miners of the state, I
principally those of Miami. j
There was no question of a shorter)
day. The Arizona law provides that
men shall not work underground more ,
than eight hours a day. The propo- j
sition presented by the company man-
agers merely extended the sliding !
wage scale to include' copper at 24 ;
cents per pound. Prior to the strike,
the scale stopped increasing after
copper reached twenty cents.
j no siriKe w nicn ended today was i
remarkable in various ways. There I
was practically no violence, a cir- i
cumstance tor which the temperance
interests gave credit to the Arizona
prohibition law. The miners did their
own policing, and as deputy sheriffs
sworn in by Sheriff James G. Cash,
of Greenlee county, aided in guarding
the property, worth millions, of ihe
employers, whom they were fighting.
For the first time probably in the
history of mine camp labor troubles,
there was no bloodshed.
State militia, in varying numbers,
were on duty for almost the' entire
period of the strike, and in this par
ticular also, the strike violated prec
edents. . The state soldiers were re
ceived with open arms by the strikers.
on a number of occasions, non
union men were beaten, but the
strikers declared that they acted only
after great provocation. A large
number of men who refused to -Join
the unions formed in each of the
three camps were invited to leave
and they entered a refugee camp at i
Duncan, 30 miles south of here. On j
another occasion, the windows of the
Arizona Copper Company's general
offices were broken. But these we're
the only breaches of order.
Soon after the strike began, J. W.
Bennie. Norman Carmichael and M.
H. MeLain, managers of the oper
ating companies hoarded a locomo
tive and 'left for El Paso to which
city the strikers sent several dele
gations to treat for peace, without
result.
The strike was palled after a period
of organization work by Miller, Gu
tierrez de Lara, a Mexican radical,
and others. Although a large major
ity of the strikers were Mexicans, and
they worked in harmony with their
fellows of other nationalities.
The strikers almost immediately
abandoned their demand for recogni
tion of the Western Federation of
Miners. They successively aban
doned all other claims except that of
higher pay, finally accepting the
proposition of the managers to return
to work and discuss grievances after
ward.

YUMA, Ariz., Jan. 24. Flood dan
gers in Yuma and the Yuma Valley
hail passed, it was believed, tonight.
The Colorado river had receded to the
22-foot stage late today and it was
thought the flow would be normal to
morrow. The rise in the Colorado at Needles,
300 miles north of here, was expected
to reach Yuma tomorrow, but this
caused no apprehension, as it was
thought it would not be sufficient to
tiring the river near flood stage again.
Reports from the lower end of the
Yuma Valley indicated that that sec
tion was untouched by the flood
waters.
Work of clearing away the debris
was begun today after the flood waters
had receded from the business sec
tion of Yuma.
The greatest menace now, appar
ently, is fear of the collapse of sev
eral large buildings. The Gondalfo
hotel has been condemned as unsafe.
The foundations of several stores ap
pear to lie settling.
The body of Mayor Charles C.
Moore, who died of heart failure dur
ing the excitement soon after the
levees gave way. was taken to Elks'
hall. It was viewed by hundreds of
residents. Funeral arrangements will
not bo completed until after the ar
rival of relatives from other cities.
Reports from the Imperial Valley
in California indicated the Colorado
was falling there and it was believed
there was no likelihood of damage to
the irrigation project in that section.
Anxiety over the flood situation was
renewed here tonight when the Col
orado river began rising again. The
stream rose to the 2.1 fool stage in a
short time and continued to rise.
Earlier in the day it had receded to
the 22-foot stage. No serious damage
was feared unless tiie river rose
above the 29-foot stage.
Workmen directed by representa
tives of the United Stales reclamation
service were hurriedly repairing the
tireaks in the levee here and at Araz
station to prevent Yuma Valley and
the Bard unit of the Indian reserva
tion being flooded a second time.
Reports from Needles, 300 miles
north of Yuma, stated the river was
S feet 8 inches above normal at that
point.
The local relief committee was busy
