SIBERIA SUFFER
San Francisco. Jan. 26. German
and Austrian prisoners are dying by
thousands in the starvation prison
dens of frozen SfTIerla, F. W. Wake
fluid, millionaire, said today upon his
return from Siberia and the Far East.
Wakefield' story of tho fato of tho
Teutons herded Hko cattle in a land
of perpetual winter aaid that 900,
000 in a camp at Teklta and another
camp on the Trnns-Slberlan railway
have been reduced by the ravage of
death to 700.000; he estimated an
other 10 per cent will perish within
tho month.
Sufferings of tho living are lndo-
scrlbable, he anld. They aro clod on
ly in tho uniform In which they were
captured, while the mercury hover
around tho 40 below zero mark; thero
I little food, for the czar la sending
all hi provisions to his armies.
Wakefield, who gained prominence
by wedding Mrs. Jack Spreckela, Jr.,
nt Honolulu directly after she re
ceived a divorce decree, declared
that Ames and Warfield, two Ameri
can Red Cross worker, are the only
hope of the dying men and tholr
work is almost futile compared to
the enormity of the suffering.
Wakefield Intends to take up the
situation with . representatives of
foreign countries In the United
States. His observation were made
at first hand, during a month's stay
with his bride at ono of the camps.
Turkish prisoners, he said, get
scant attention, for. the authorities
know that they .will die of the cold
sooner or later, anyway, It starvation
does not take them.

The Oriole Already Cleared of Litigation, and an Excel
lent Showing Made Under Its Receivership in Paying
Off Indebtedness, and Funds for the Almeda Said . to
Have Been Received
It Is evident that the Gallce mining
district will aoon be upon the map In
capital letters, for the litigation that
ha Involved both the great proper
ties ot thut camp, the Oriole and the
Almeda, I about to be cleared and
both mine will resume their right
ful places among the big producers
of the west.
The records ot tho court show that
the Oriole has Just been released
from litigation, and it Is stated that
It will soon resume operation. One
of the retiring officers ot the company
states that previous to 1907 the
Oriole wa a paying property, hlp-
plng high grade ore and paying for
it development. It fell into the
hands ot a promoter, was incorpor
ated, and stock to the amount of
$200,000 was sold throughout the
east, the official state at all kinds of
prices and up on nil kinds of repre
sentation. About $80,000 of this
stock sale found its way into the de
velopment of tho property, and for
tunately was judiciously and intelli
gently expended. The balance, It Is
said, went to pay the premium upon
the promotion, and the property was
deliberately allowed to become In
volved In debt.
In March, 1915, the local officials,
in hope of saving the creditors and
stockholders, placod the property in
the hands of Sam H. Baker, of the
Josephine County bank, as receiver.
The receivership was a success and
sets a record for southern Oregon In
such cases, as Mr. Daker In seven
months cleaned up the affairs of the
company and the creditors have been
paid one hundrod cents on the dol
lar; but in order to do this, J. C. Mat
tlson, who originally was sole own
er of the property, voluntarily gave
up a majority ot his remaining In
terest to repay" the eastorn stock
holders and to secure money to pay
off the creditors.
The Oriole Is probably as system
atically developed as any in the state;
It has about a mllo of underground
work, a ten-stamp mill, electric
lights, power drills, air compressor,
otc. There aro large bodies ot good
ore openod and it should soon be
again among the producers. It has
In the post shown many lenses of
high-grade that gave returns of from
$200 to $240 per ton by carload lots

TELL GREAT
INTERFERENCE
Washington, Jan. 25. Pursuing
its purpose of halting British trade
interference, the state department
has practically completed the draft
ing of a vigorous, unequivocal pro
test to England, declaring In sub
stance that tho United States will not
rocogntze as legal the British "trad
ing with tho enemy" law it It disturbs
commercial relations ot American
firms with German interests.
This new phase ot the Interference
subject will bo forwarded soon to
Ambassador Pago in the form of rep
resentations to be presented to Down
ing street.
The virtual protest does not ques
tion England's right to apply the act
prohibiting "trading with the enemy"
to Its own citizens, but it does hold
as Illegal any interference with the
trade ot American firms In which
German citizens or German money
are Interested.

From the East
value ot the mine is conceded to be
Its vastbody of medium and low
grade ore, which must be worked at
the mine.
The property Is now in control ot
Ohio and Kansas people, the head
quarters being Dayton, Ohio, and W,
W. Piper, ot MlamlBburg, Ohio, is
here representing their interests.
Portland, Jan. 25. With a check
for $225,000 In his pocket, Nat P.
Bills, of Waverly, Iowa, Is in Port
land today reorganizing the Almeda
Consolidated Mines company. He
conferred today with Captain T. S
Burley, receiver of the property,
which la located in- the Gallce dis
trict of Grants Pas. Ellis will at
tempt to have Judge Calkins close
the receivership, after which the
mine will be operated at full (blast.
The above telegram, received by
the Courier from Portland this morn
ing, carries great good news to this
district, for It indicates that the Al
meda will soon be brought from un
der Its tangle ot litigation. The
Almeda has recently been operated
under lease by P. B. Wickbam. . It
baa a smelter upon the property, and
Is known as one of the richest cop
per properties in Oregon.

Meantime, negotiations over the
Lusltanla case with Germany have
apparently taken an unsatisfactory
turn, for tt Is indicated that fresh
proposals turned over to the govern
ment today do not meet American
demands fully. As for the Persia
case, this government will take up
with Turkey the matter of disavowal,
reparation, punishment and subscrip
tion to American demands In conduct
of sea warfare should Turkey admit
responsibility for the torpedoing. If,
however, ehe denies responsibility,
the incident will be closed.

COURT DECISION
EFFECTS WATER
Washington, Jan. 25. Conserva
tion men said today there may be far-
reaching effects in the decision of the
supreme court that states have the
right to pass laws authorizing the
states by eminent domain to con
demn power sites and. water rights.
They declared . that this ruling will
mean that states can condemn even
federal lands except such properties
as military reservations and the like.
They believed it will have the ten
dency of opening up irrigation and
power Bites, though they indicated
that many such extensions may be op
posed to the theories of men believing
in reserving and conserving snch
lands.

(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Washington, Jan. 25. That an un
satisfactory turn has been given to
the Lositanla torpedoing negotiations
by the latest note from Germany on
the subject was indicated by the
White House today. This came In
an official statement that press an
nouncement that the new note meet
all of America's demands "la pure
supposition, not justified by facts." .
The new note, which tn advance
bad been regarded as probably the
last step in the case, was handed by
Berostorff to Secretary Lansing Sat
urday and presented yesterday to
President Wilson. Today it was laid
before the cabinet. In the hope of
clearing up the case as far as pos
sible before he starts his prepared
ness stumping tour, the president will
confer at length with Lansing to
morrow. He postponed his Wednes
day departure for New York to mid
night, in order that he might have
this session. . . ,
Meanwhile, it Is possible that Lans
ing will hold a conference with
Bernstorff.
Forecasts of. the note to which the
state department is believed to have
objected said that Germany had re
frained from mentioning the matter
of future warnings to liners before
making submarine attacks, and had
modified her refusal to concede
wrong-doing on the part of the diver
that sank the Lusltanla. ',.
A German embassy official declared
the note is Germany's last word and
indicated that he had reason to
think that the president and the state
department would regard it as meet

SHADE OF BARD OF
T
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
San Francisco, Jan. 25. William
Shakespeare, the well known Bard of
Avon, rolled over in his grave today
Lwhen he heard, that , the San Fran
cisco board of supervisors had drawn
odious comparisons about his place
in the eun, and had even feared that
for the sake of neutrality San Fran
cisco ought not to honor his tercen
tennary April 25.,... ,
In an interview received by a spirit
reporter, Shakespeare declared:
"In faith, my lord, it gives me
pause that John O. Walsh' should de
clare Byron a much greater poet than
Wh. mv lord, thou eh in mv own
time I was regarded as no better than
a penny-a-liner, prithee have I not
since been known the world over a
tne greatest writer or au timer'
The bard's shade was a bit peeved,
too, because Supervisor Wolf had de
clared Charles Dickens did more for
the plain people than Shakespeare
ever did. But, anyhow, after sweep
ing aside the objection that citizens
might object to the celebration on the
grounds of neutrality, jthe . board
agreed to hae the celebration, . Sup
ervisor Hocks, of Teutonic extraction,
swung the tide In favor of the re
