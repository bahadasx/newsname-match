she shnll make a frank and full state
ment of hor entlro llfo with Dr. Mohr,
laying horself open to the moat

Furthermore, Mrs. Mohr will bo one
of tho very first witnesses called

Is intended that tho story Mrs. Mohr
lias to tell of hor alleged sufferings at
the hands of bor husband shall din
clow without reserve his relationship
with other women, to whlob there hns

progress of tho trial. This may bring
Into tho caso the names of many per
sons well known in Newport and

she knows of the mysterious "littlo

have kept.
Mrs. Mohr will make utter denial of
the charges against her in tho so
called confessions of tho negroes that
sho badgered them Into murder, say
ing that whatever communication she
hod with them was as tho wife of
their employer. As to tho bringing
of her namo into tho present case,
hor attorneys will ehow that it was

Change Plea and Released
Under, $7,500 Bail.
Robetl Colgate Wood was indicted to-day for soliciting a bribe while
he was a Public Service Commissioner. The principal witness against
Wood was Sidney G. Johnson, Vice President of the Union Switch and
Signal Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., who swore that Wood asked him for
$5,000 as a condition for Wood's turning over to him the contract for

say?"
"Tho defendant enters a plea of
not guilty," replied his counsel, Will
iam M. Pnrko of Stnnchfleld & Levy,
"and nsks for ono week's tlmo In
which to withdraw the plea and mako
such motions aa arc necessary."
The motion was granted, and Har
old Nrfrrls, for tho National Security
Company, gavo $7,500 hall for Wood.
The Indicted man was asked if he
had anything to say about tho charge.
Ho answered with a long, loud
"NO-O-OI" His lawyer, Mr. Parke,
said:

"I understand you have finished
tho Important matter which you have

I express to you tho thanks of the

Ono of tho strongest parts of Mr.
Johnson's testimony was his de
scription of tho olllco at No. Ex

aakod him for tho brllo. Johnson
told of finding tho offlco furnlturo
piled up, as If for removal. It is a fact

said tho Ciller objections were made to
tho actions of the iicki'dcs in the
harem sccno of "Scheherazade." and
to tho antics of the Satyr with the
scarf of tho Faun. The critics did not
think, Mr. Hrown said with cutting
sarcasm, that the Satyr should lie
down on the scarf in tho suggestive
way ho did. If that Satyr wanted to
show his affection for a piece of tex
tile belonging to the object of his af
fection why didn't he kiss tho scarf?
In tho story IiooIih which tho critics
