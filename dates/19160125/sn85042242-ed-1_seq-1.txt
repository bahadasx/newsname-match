NCOME TAX
IS
Congress Contemplates Amending
Act to Yield Nearly $200,j
000,000 Annually.
OF ALL SUITS
Those Earning' From $2,000 to
$3,000 a Year May Bo
Assessed.
Washington, Jan. 24.—The income
(ax was declared constitutional today
by tho supreme court in an unani­
mous decision, which swept aside
every contention raised against it
and, in the opinion tho congressional
leaders, opened the way for increas­
ing the tax rate on great fortunes to
help pay for national defense.
After Big Incomes.
Proposals are pending in congress
to tax incomes of more than $1,000,
000 as high as tlfty per cent. Lead­
ers on all sides agree that out of the
impetus which the decision today will
give such proposals is likely to come
a definite movement to levy on the
revenues from great private fortunes
for some of the millions the govern­
ment must raise to carry out the
army and navy increases.
Clears Way.
"The supreme court's decision lias
absolutely unfettered the income tax
as a source of revenue," said Repre­
sentative Hull of Tennessee, author
of the law. "All doubt is removed
and congress is left much freef to
act. I believe congress will take ad­
vantage of the opportunity to amend
the law materially. Without any un­
usual or unjust charges, it can be
made to yield $195,000,000 to $200,
000,COO a year, as against $£.1,000,000
to $90,000,000 at present."
Lower Limits.
Representative Hull is preparing
amendment's to carry the tax to in­
comes bilow $8,000 and /itaflilil
increases in the sur-taxes on incomes
exceeding $20,000. a year.
So far^ the problem of raising the
revenue for national defense, al­
though approached from many angles,
has not been carried toward any defi­
nite solution because, with the con­
stitutionality of the income tax un­
decided, administration readers were
reluctant to place too much depend­
ence on it.
Settles All Points.
The decision was announced by
Chief Justice White. It was render­
ed in the appeal of Frank R. Brusli
habe.r from the action of the New
York federal court in refusing to en­
join the Southern Pacific, of which
Brushhalier was a stockholder, from
paying the tax. The case raised sub­
stantially every point' involved in all
the income tax cases before the
court.

^Washington, Jtui. 24.—Granting of
lands in not less than two years and
not more than four years may be fav
ored by the Wilson administration.
Senator Hitchcock, chairman of the
Philippine committee, discussed with
President Wilson a provision to that
effect, which Senator Clarke of Ar­
kansas had introduced as an amend
ment to the pending Philippine bill.
After conferring with the presi­
dent, Senator Hitchcock, while h«
would not say what the president had
told him, indicated it was probable
the amendment would have the ad
ministration's support. He said he
would have to talk with other sena
tors before deciding definitely wheth­
er the change would be accepted,
The president previously opposed an­
other amendment proposed by Sena­
tor Clarke proposing independence
for the Philippines within two years
The Clarke amendment would direct
the president to invite the attention
of the powers to maintain the sover­
eignty of the islands, and if such an
agreement could not be reached,
would authorize him to guarantee in
behalf of the United States alone the
independence of the islands in a per­
iod of four years.
Senator Clarke's amendment was
the subject of an animated discussion
during the day. Senator, Borah, Re­
publican, and Thomas, Democrat,
both expressed themselves as believ­
ing the good of the United States lay
in cutting off from the Philippines as
soon as possible.
Senator Colt, Republican, asserted
that it would be an act of injustice
to the Philippines.
Woman Elopes
With a Negro
Salt. Lake City, Jan. 24.—Raymond
Dobbs, a negro, and Mrs. Viola Hood,
a white woman, who eloped from San
Diego last 'Friday, surrendered them­
selves to the Salt Lake City police
today and both declared that their
act was voluntary.
•Dobbs appeared at the police sta­
tion this morning and announced his
identity. He said Mrs. Hood had
eloped with him of her own volition,
and that he had never employed
threats to induce her to leave her
home.
Mrs. Hood gave herself up this af­
ternoon. She confirmed Dobb's story,
according to the police, and says she
will return to San Diego, if desired,
on condition that Dobbs be set at lib­
erty. The police also say Mrs. 'Hood
said their plan was to be married
here under assumed names and make
their home in Chicago. The two are
held by the police for advices from
San Diego.

EXTREME REGRET
IS EXPRESSED
Proposal Now Before State De­
partment Final Word in
Negotiations.
Washington, .Ian. 21.—Germany lias
submitted to the United States
through Ambassador von -Bernatorff
another written proposal, designed to
bring about a settlement of the sink­
ing of the steamer, Lusitania.
There were indications tonight that
the documents might bring to a sat­
isfactory termination negotiations
which have been in progress for eight
months.
Although the greatest secrecy sur­
rounds the negotiations, it was slated
tonight, on excellent authority, that
Germany had consented to eliminate
from the text of the agreement any
mention of the warning issued by the
German embassy the .day the 'Lusi­
tania. sailed on her last trip from
New York. Mention of this warning
is understood to have been contain­
ed in the proposal which was reject­
ed alter President Wilson had con­
sidered it.
It is understood also that Germany
has left other proposed general res­
ervations of admission of wrong-do­
ing on the part of the submarine
commander to which the United
States objected.
It was also stated authoritatively
that in its latest communication Ger­
many makes some reference to a de­
sire to see the United States take
action in regard to the questions in­
volving freedom of the seas.
To Confer.
^^TJ^r^rBajaa^anthassador and Secv
retaty Tldlislrig' probably will confer
regarding the proposal in the future
Germany reiterates clearly, it is
said, that the torpedoing of the Lusi­
tania was an act of reprisal for the
E'ritish blockade of the German coast.
Extreme regret is again expressed
that Americans lost their lives in the
commission of the reprisal and Ger
many freely offers reparation in the
form of indemnity. The attention of
the United State* is cdllel to the
fact that some forms of reprisals
have been discontinue'!.
Proposals Final.
The German government is under­
stood to be most anxious vo settle
the matter in a manner mutually sat­
isfactory. It is said, however, that
the proposal now before the adminis­
tration is considered to be filial. Ger­
many is said to hold that she has
gone as far as she possibly can hon­
orably to meet the views of the [In
ed States.
The negotiations are treated as
highly confidential in official and dip­
lomatic circles. For that reason il
has not been disclosed just how far
the new proposal would go Toward
finally settling the controversy. An
optimistic feeling skeins to prevail
however.
Tho document is said to cover
about one and a-half sheet of ordi­
nary letter size paper. Cnint von
Bernstorff is understood to have per­
sonally drafted the proposal now un­
der consideration.

IS BLOW TO THIS
NATION'S BUSINESS
In Seeking to Injure Germany a
Severe Blow Is Directed
Against U. S.
Washington, Jan. iM.—Groat Brit­
ain is vigorously opposed by the Unit­
ed 'Slates in representations prepar­
ed today for presentation to the Brit­
ish foreign office. They IIV expected
to go forward immediately.
The state depart nn'iit considers
that, grave and unjustifiable injury to
American •commerce may follow
should attempts be made to enforce
provisions affecting business in this
country. "The trading with iIn* ene­
my act" prohibits persons resident in
Great iBritain from trading with indi­
viduals or corporations engaged with
the Teutonic allies or having busi­
ness with them. The position of the
United States is that, aside from le­
gal authority for the proposed inter­
ference with trade, I lie relation of
German trade and capital with Am­
erican industries are such that it
would be quite impossible to success­
fully aim a. blow at Germany without
doing great damage Jo interests in
this country.
The representations will not take
the form of a protest because the act
is limited in its immediate opera­
tions to British subjects.
The representations will serve the
purpose of warning Great E'ritain that
the act is regarded as being wholly
unfair and that proper Compensation
will be expected for any injury sus­
tained by American trade.
ARRIVESIN PORT
Question of Armed Merchantmen
Will Be Taken Up at
Washington.
Washington, Jan. 24.—'Arrival of
the Italian steamship Verona in New
York today with two guns mounted at
her stern probably will result in the
Austro-Hungarian government taking
up diplomatically with the United
States all the broad questions involv­
ed in the arming of merchant ships
for defensive purposes. It was indi­
cated tonight that the charge of the
Austrian government here would in­
form his government of the arrival
of the ship, and call on Secretary
Lansing in the near future to deter­
mine the position of the United
States.
It was freely predicted in Teutonic
circles, when the Italian ship Guisep
pe Verdi was allowed to sail recently
from New York with guns mounted,"
that a communication on the subject
was immediately to follow the arrival
of another Italian ship similarly arm­
ed. It was authoritatively stated to­
night that the Austro-Hungarian gov­
ernment probably would inform the
United States that any Italian ship
encountered by an Austrian submar­
ine would he sunk without warning,
regardless of who is aboard.

Air raids have
taken place in vaunus localities. Ger­

in an aeroplane, which was engaged
by all anti-air craft guns and pursued
by British airmen.
Whether bombs were dropped is
not stated.
This was the third venture of the
kind in two days. In the other visit,
bombs having been dropped on the
docks and stations at Dover, and
aviation sheds at Houvahan, near
Dover, according to Berlin official re­
ports, which say "heavy fires were
observed" at Dover.
On the F'rench and Austrian fronts,
the usual bombardment continues
but without great gains for either
side. The British explosion of a mine
near St. Loi, in the Arras region, did
considerable damage to German
trenches and also silenced German
trench mortars by artillery fire near
Ypress.
(Floods and generally bad weather
are hampering the operations of the
British against the Turks in Messo

In northwest Egypt the British

tribesmen being dispersed and their
