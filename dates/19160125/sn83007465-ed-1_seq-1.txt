! MONTENEGRIN PORTS
ARE CAPTURED
King Nicholas Has Only a Few
Miles of Seacoast
Left.
HARD FIGHTING
IN FRANCE
Hermans AiiacK ana capture
First Line Trench?Russians
Still Advance.
Two German air raids on the!
coast of England; the capture
of Montenegro's two principal
seaports by the Austrians and
the taking by the Germans of
trenches from the French near
Arras and in the Argonne forV
est are told in the latest official
communications of London,
Vienna and Berlin.
First one German aeroplane
and 12 hours later two German
seaplanes flew over and dropped
bombs on the east coast of
Kent. Nine bombs were dropped
by the aeroplane. One man
was killed and two men, one
woman and three children were
injured. Some damage was
done to property. The raid of
the seaplanes was without effect,
apparently, the London
war office declaring that no
damage was done and that no
casualties had been reported.
The aircraft, in hnth insfonpoo
escaped, although they were
fired upon by the British guns
and chased by British aviators.
Antavari and Dulcigno on the
Adriatic coast of Montenegro,
have fallen into the hands of
Austrians which leaves to King
Nicholas only a few miles of
front on the sea and gives to the
Austrians command of the coast
from the gulf or Triest virtually
to the Albanian frontier.
Vienna reports that Ihe Montenegrins
continue to lay down
their arms and that in addition
1,500 Serbians have surrendered
in the p-st few days, although
a serd-official communication
says that a consider-:
- able portion of the Montenegrin
army has declitied to surrender
and that fierce fighting has been
resumed in the mountain districts.
Heavy fighting has been in
progress in France, a French
advanced position on the road
between Arras and Lens being
attacked by strong German
forces. The infantry attack
was preceded by mine explosions
and a violent bombardment
arid the Germans captured
a first line trench on a front
of several hundred yards.
French counter attacks were
immediately inaugurated and a
portion of the captured trench
was reiaaen. me (jermans,
however, at the close of the
day, occupied about 200 yards
of the advanced trench which
formed a salient in the French
lines.
The British forces in Mesopotamia
going to the relief of
Kut-el-Amara, are being hampered
by bad weather, nevertheless
fierce fighting with varying
success is being indulged in
with the Turks. General Sir
Percy Lake, the new British
commander in chief, reports
that the casualties oh both
sides have been very heavy.
The Russians are continuing
their advance against the Turks
in the Caucasus. Petrojrrad
says the Turks are making aj
precipitate retreat in tne region
of Er^irum and that the Russians
are capturing prisoners
and ammunition and other supplies.
The roads are strewn
with Turkish dead.
The Russians also are on the;
offensive attainst the Teutons'
south of Dubno, one of the Vol-1
hynian triangle, of fortresses'
and on the Dniester and Prulh
- river in east Gnlicia.
At one point along the Pruthi
Vienna says the Austrians blew
up a Russian trench killing1
nearly all of the 300 men in it. |

y Seldom has there come such a
- shock to the entire community
8 as came Saturday morning
'"with the tidings of the passing
h of Mr. W. McD. Brown. This
e good man had for the fortnight
8 previous been suffering with a
severe attack of grip, but not
until Friday was his condition
y regarded as critical. About 9
* o'clock that morning his heart
became involved and further
complications arose, but as the
e I day wore on he seemed to rally.
At midnight, however, his conj'idition
rapidly grew worse and
all hope of his recovering was
1 abandoned. At 6:30 Saturday
t morning, January 22, he pass"
ed quietly from earth.
e, The passing of William Mcy
Donald Brown is no common
loss. He was a man who had
.e identified himself thoroughly
l" with everything that was high
8! and ennobling. Mr. Brown was
'* i a son of the late Daniel W.
^ Brown and Amanda Barnes, the
** latter a sister of Col. Dixon
Barnes, who fell at the battle
^ of Sharpsburg, while in com

in the southern part of

early boyhood was spent.' Afj

Military school, in old Yorkville,
where under the tutelage of Col.
Asbury Coward, his education

n Mr. Brown was married
ilj February 4, 1874, to Miss Ella

(1 son, survive him, viz: Mrs.
Stewart William Heath of
d Winnsboro; Dr. Robert Crawe

e Miss Betty Brown. His first
j wife died in the early 90's find
in 1898, Mr. Brown was married
to Miss Margaret Davis,
, who predeceased him three
years ago.
Mr. Brown was identified
s with the firm of Leroy Sprinars
and Company almost from its
organization, later with Heath,
i Springs and Company, and finh
ally with the Lancaster Mer}
cantile Company, of which he
has been one of the managers
e and principal stockholders for a
'" number of years. Fair and del"
