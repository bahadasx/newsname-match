SINKING U. S. SHIP
Dr. Carl Duesing Says High
Official of Japan Sponsor
Publication.
. The Farmer is m receipt of a com
munication from . Dr. Carl Duesing,
formerly professor of mathematics at
Kiel, Germany, where the Royal Na
val College Is located,1 and now a uni
versity professor in 'Magdeburg.
Prof. Duesing"s letter contains a
revelation that 'has , been made in
semi-official circles, concerning plans
of certain - Japanese in regard to
America. -
. The revelation was 'made in a trans
lation of a book published by -the
Japanese League for National De
fense.. ' It contains startlingly frank
assertions about what Japanese offi
cials would have' done to the United
States and its possessions. The book
has created a .stir among German
officials.
Outside of the United States Secret
Service;' possibly, no Americans are
familiar - with the threats conveyed
In the publication, which purports to
have been sponsored by such persons
of high standing jes Prime Minister
Okuma, Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Kato and-Count Yamamato.
,. A synopsis of the translation , is 'giv
en Farmer readers by Prof. Duesing,
Who is admirably informed of German
affairs. His letters have appeared in
The Farmer from time, to time, and
have served ,toi present, the German
viewpoint oh' war happenings. (
By Dr. Carl Duessing. .
I am Writing something today that
will be of special -interest ta read'
era of The Farmer.' It is about Ja
pan. ' , - i :
Ten m-dTRTis;. "ago my- letter about
"The Next War" , was printed" in The
Farmer. .Then I- predicted that the
next great struggle would be between
Japan and the United States. ' I made
the statement, that some of the bullets
that are made today in ; Bridgeport
for the Allies will later be shot by the
Japanese , In Calif ornia-against the
American soldiers.! So eager are the
Ameri cans. for thoproflts arising from
war business, that they do not realize
the great danger that ,1s arising in the
Far Fast.', "" ..-' -.. ' -N .': ' i
-,' The Japanese Leagme. for National
Defense lately has published-' a little
book, which carries the title, "The
War Between Japan and . America.''
More than .1,000.000 -copies of" this
book have been sold and distributed
broadcast throughout Japan. ' . .
On- the front page , you see the pic
ture of a victorious Japanese battle
ship, in front of which the Stars and
Stripes are fast sinking to .disappear
In the waters! x' ' '
The highest officials of this Japan
ese League for National Defense are
the prime "mijniater. Count Okuma,
Count Tamamoto and the secretary
for foreign. affairs, Kato. These
names should suffice to -show the im
portance of this .book. -
How aggressive the book is shows
very plainly in the first sentence - on
the first ipage: . ""The hearts of sixty
millions of, Japanese, all loyal subjects
of the Mikado, are inflamed with cour
age, and are stormy, like the strong,
wfhd a' of the, heavens. Insisting that
!a war be begun against, the United
States, which, will 'prove to the bluff
ing Americans, that the Japanese peo
ple do not know defeat, and that her
soldiers cannot be beaten." '
..; The chjief causes, for this proposed
war are giyem'as "the inhuman treat
ment of tire. Japanese immigrants and
the hostile legislation of th,e ' United
States." Japan ought to occupy Cal
ifornia, Hawaii and the Philippine Isl
ands, according to the book. . s
"In all these places, we have count-
less spies to get information of mili
tary importance for.' the' great day.
Eighty thousand , Japanese live in the
Hawaiis, all trained reservists, each
with his special Instruction and all
know their duty..
"The Panama canal could be ren
dered useless for months with- one
single ship full of explosives. After
that, our troops would have taken the
Philippine Islands and Hawaii long
before the American fleet would be
able to arrive -in the wsaters of the Pa
cific Ocean.- From these islands it
is not far to1 California. We could
also count on the aid and assistance
of Mexico." . "
The United States army is called. a
''joke" by this book. "Japan could
send 12,000,000 soldiers to the front,
all trained military-wise, Japan pre
pares incessantly for the war," it
.says. .
In ' many, public meetings in Japan
have been preached hate and war,
against the Americans, in the strong
est expressions. Especially is the
statement- made, that the god of 'the
Americans is the dollar, and that they
are not capable to sacrifice themselves
for their ideas; that America wants
to dominate' the .whole world "with
money and corruption"; and that "all
nations would be grateful to Japan
if she succeeds."
