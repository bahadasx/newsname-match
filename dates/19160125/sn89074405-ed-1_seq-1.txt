Heard expressed gratification at his
ability to "report that there Is a gen-

"This," he added, "if carried out
along the lines of good Judgment, will
eliminate for all time the friction
which has so long existed between
sheep and cattle men. It will also
mean better breeding, the develop

the prbduction upon the vast area of
public grazing grounds of a large

El Paso, TeiL .Jan. 25.—General

yesterday a re^eft that a united
States £oltU*r naiftfect HarWsOn -be
punished for-: having flred on and
wounded a Mexican civilian last Sat
urday afternoon. At the same time
representations to Z. L. Cobb, United
States costums collector here, were
made that. American cattle thieves
were stealing cattle from Mexican
owners south of the border. A de
mand was made that the thieves be
apprehended and punished.
The Mexican authorities in their re
ported representations, referred to the
prompt punishment they meted out to
the Duran brothers, Mexican cattle
thieves, who. were executed yesterday
for the murder of Bert Akers, an
American killed last Friday when
seeking to recover stolen cows.
Mexican officials at Juarez said they
hoped prompt action would be taken
by -the American authorities, saying
there was apparent in Juarez a pro
nounced. feeling resulting from the
execution of the two Mexicans for the
.killing of one American and the shoot
ing of the civilian, Alejandro Soto,
by the United States soldier last Sat
urday.
According to the Mexicans, Soto was
shot while aiding a Carranza soldier
in watering some horses in the Rio
Grande river. A preliminary investi
gation already made by army officers
on this side is said to have shown that
Soto was on American territory and
armed at the time. He is said to
have defied the soldier and threatened
to use his own rifle when Harrison
opened fire, shooting twelve, times. A
doubt was expressed also that Soto
had been wounded.
General Gavira said that Soto's
wound was superficial. Harrison is
held in confinement.
Collector Cobb reported to Wash
ington yesterday that the Carranza
authorities were doing everything pos
sible to aid Americans. He was ad
vised that Chihuahua state officials
were shipping to the border $25,000
worth of silver bars belonging to an
American concern. The bars had
been seized and preparations were
being made to mint them into money.

Washington, .Tan. 25.—President
Wilson told Chairman Kitchen of the
ways and means committee that he
favors the creation of a tariff com
mission, and will attempt to put the
bill for one through during the pres
ent session of congress.
The president expected to discuss
the question in his special message

commission instead of creating a new
body, but the president believes a sep

The president's plan is said to be
for the non-partisan commission is for
the purpose of collecting facts for
congress. While officials would not
say that his decision to support the
tariff commission bill meant, he
thought there should be changes in
some of the tariff schedules, it is in
dicated that he believed some changes
might be necessary after tbe war.
Some time ago the president was
said to feel that the powers of the tar
iff commission already existed in the
trade commission,, but he has now
changed his views.
Kitchen also said that he thought
the committee would support the anti
dumping legislation. Details have not
been worked out, but he thought the
measure would be reported as similar
to the anti-dumping clause of the
Underwood tariff bill, which was elim
inated in the senate. The clause pro
posed an additional tariff on goods
sent, to the United States to be sold
at less than market price in the
country from which they exported.
