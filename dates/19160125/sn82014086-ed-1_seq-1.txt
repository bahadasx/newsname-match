AMERICAN BLUEJACKETS
GET BEST OF FOOD.
Rear Admiral McGowan Declares They
Are the Best Fed Body of Men in the
World.
Washington, Jan. 24. "If we serve
eggs aboard ship, the men want to see
the Bhelis; if we serve potatoes, they
want to see the skins; and they're en
titled to," said Rear Admiral McGowan,
paymaster of the navy, in telling the
house naval committee today that
American bluejackets are the best fed
body of men in the world. .
"When any of our men has eaten
what's on the mess table," he added,
"he's had a mighty good meal, and he's
satisfied."
While the naval ration costs 36 cents
per day per man and the army ration
about 26 or 27 cents, the admiral de
clared he never would, under any cir
cumstances, recommend any lower
quality or smaller quantity of food for
the sailor.
Representative Kelley of Michigan
asked whether the United States suc
cessfully could send 200,000 soldiers to
the Philippines and properly care for
their provisioning.
It would present gigantic propor
tions compared to the much smaller
number of men we have to feed in the
fleet," the admiral replied, "but the
feeding of 200,000 men is no greater
problem than feeding 2,000 if we have
the same sources of supply and refrig
eration. The distance is no problem."
Admiral McGowan said it cost from
$18,000 to 25,000 to educate each cadet
at Annapolis, and that the results were
worth it. Of the $130,000 appropriated
last year for the new naval reserve,
only $10,000 has been spent, he explain
ed, as only 176 men, had responded in
the first six months of this fiscal year.
The admiral concurred in a recom
mendation made by Secretary Daniels
in a letter read by Chairman Padgett
that navy uniforms be made in a gov
ernment factory. The letter said the
so-called clothing factory at the
Brooklyn navy yard did no more than
cut materials. Mr. Daniels E.sked for
an appropriation of $50,000 'from the
clothing and small stores fund to alter
the plant at Brooklyn and to equip it
for complete manufacture of clothes.
He said the Charleston, S. C. factory
had demonstrated that the cost of
production could be lowered.

Income Tax Law
is Constitutional
UNANIMOUS DECISION BY THE
SUPREME COURT
GOVT. HAS FREE REIN
Decision Will Give Impetus
to Pro-
posals Now Before Congress, One of
Which Calls for a 60 Per Cant. Tax
on Incomes More Than $1,000,000. ,
Washington, Jan. 24. The income
tax was declared constitutional today
by the supreme court in an unanimous
decision which swept aside every con
tention raised against it and, in the
opinion of congressional leaders, open
ed the way for increasing the tax rate
on great fortunes to help pay for na
tional defense.
Proposals Pending In Congress. '
Proposals are pending in congress
to tax incomes of more than $1,000,000
as high as 50 per cent. Leaders on all
sides agree that out of the impetus
which the decision today will give
such proposals is likely to come a
definite movement to levy on the reve
nues from great private fortunes for
some of the millions the government
must raise to carry out the army and
navy increases.
May Yield $195,000,000 a Year.
The supreme court's decision has
absolutely unfettered the income tax
i source of revenue, said Repre
sentative 'Hull of Tennessee, author of
the law. "All doubt is removed and
congress is left much freer to act. 1
believe congress will take advantage of
the opportunity to amend the law ma
terially. Without any unusual or un
just charges it can be -made to yield
$i85,ouo,ooo to $195,000,000 a year as
against $85,000,000 or $90,000,000 as
present.
Representative Hull is preparing
amendments to carry the tax to in
comes below $3,000 and make graded
increases in the surtaxes on incomes
exceeding $20,000 a year, t
So far the problem of raising the
revenue for national defense, although
approached from many angles, has not
been carried toward any definite solu
tion, because with the constitutionality
of the income tax undecided, adminis
tration leaders were reluctant to place
too much dependence on it.
Broadest Interpretation Possible,
In its decision the supreme court
construed for the first, time the six
teenth amendment to the constitution,
under which the tax is levied, and
gave it the broadest interpresation pos
sible, rejecting suggestions to confine
Its scope to narrow limits.
Decision. Annunre4-by CHef-nuttco
White.
The decision was announced by Chief
justice White. It was rendered in the
appeal of Frank R. Brushaber from
the action of the New York federal
court in refusing to enjoin the South
ern Pacific, of which Brushaber was a
stockholder, from paying the tax. The
case raised substantially every point
involved in all . the five income tax
cases before the court, with the excep
tion of tne effect of the provision al
lowing mining corporations to make a
5 per cent, deduction annually from
gross income for depletion of mines.
This provision is regarded as being
an amendment to the old corporation
tax rather than a feature of the income
tax.
16th Amendment Holds Good.
The basic error of those who attack
ed the constitutionality of the tax.
Lnier Justice White held, was in re
gard to the sixteenth amendment as
empowering the United States to levy
a direct tax without apportionment
among the states according to popula
tion. In substance, the court held that
the sixteenth amendment had not em
powered the federal government to
levy a new tax, but that "the whole
purpose of the amendment was to re
lieve all income taxes from a consid
eration of the source whence the in
come was derived."
Those opposing the tax had urged
that the sixteenth amendment provid
ed that income from "whatever source
derived," should be taxed without re
gard to apportionment among the
states. They argued that the Under-
wood-Simms tax provision by reason
of exemption of certain incomes from
taxation had - not come within the
meaning of the amendment.
Power to Levy Never Questioned.
Chief Justice White said the power
of the federal government to levy an
Income tax had never been questioned.
Quoting at length from the famous in
come tax decisions of 1895, he declared
the court then recognized the fact that
taxation on income was in the nature
of an excise entitled to be enforced as
such unless and until it was concluded
that to enforce it would amount to ac
complishing the result which the re
quirement as to apportionment of di
rect taxation was adopted to prevent,
in which' case the duty would arise to
disregard the form and consideration
of the substance alone, and hence sub
ject the tax to the regulation as to ap
portionment wnicn otnerwise as an
excise would not apply to it."
The court then decided, he added,
that the effect of the tax on income
from real estate was the same as if a
direct tax had been levied on the real
estate and that it was with a view of
obviating such questions . that the
amendment had been adopted.
No Limitations Embraced.
Inasmuch as the amendment had-not
conferred the power to levy an in
come tax, said the chief justice, it
could not be interpreted as embracing
limitations as to the nature and char
acter of Income to be taxed. To con
sider it as embracing limitations, such
as not authorizing a progressive tax,
he held, was irreconciliable with the
purpose of the amendment. He ex
plained, too, that the uniformity of
excise taxes required by the constitu
tion was geographical uniformity and
not uniformity of application as to
classes.
Taxation on Incomes.
The chief justice further held that
the tax did not - violate the "due
process" provision of the constitution
by Imposing a higher rate of taxation
on incomes above 920,000 than on those
below that figure or by other pro
visions. - .

unidentified men. The most serious
ly injured are Mrs. Helen Kelker, 45
years old, wife of Charles Kelker,
both legs blow off and Stanley Kon-
ieszny, 21 years old, chest crushed.
Mrs. Kelker probably will die.
Konieczny is expected to recover. The
building occupied by the firm was
long, two Ftory frame structure, the
first floor and basement of which
were used for the machine shop and
the second floor as a storeroom and
living apartments.
Demolished All the Walls.
The explosion demolished all the
walls and tore out large pieces, of
the concrete foundation, letting the
roof down on the debris, which
caught fire. Pieces of the founds
tion were thrown hundreds of feet and
the concussion smashed virtually
every window within the radius of a
block.
Caused Panio in Nearby School.
Within 300 feet of the Kelker plant
Is a large Grammar school. About
1500 boys and girls were at their desks
when the windows of the building
were shattered. A temporary panic en
sued, but it was quickly controlled
by the teachers and the children were
marched to the street in perfect order.
Narrow Escapes. .
Charles Kelker and his two sons,
John and Albert J were in the ma
chine shop when the .explosion oc
curred. One of the boys was blown
through an open door. The others
wtfre- taXn""rrom "the wreckage" All
escaped witn a lew Druises.
'Might Be Due to Gas. ' '
Mr. Kelker was uncertain as to the
cause of the explosion, but thought
it might be due to gas, which was
used in several forms in the welding
room and was kept in retainers in
the basement. He estimated the fl
nancial loss at $50,000.
Two Bodies Taken Out.
The flames were extinguished In less
than an hour and a large force of
firemen was put to work searching
the ruins. At nightfall only two
bodies had been taken out, but the
bodies of two others could be seen
under piles of broke machinery.
