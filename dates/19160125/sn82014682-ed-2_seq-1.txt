OF REPUBLICANS PLAIN
Shows How Democratic Inter
ests in South Try to Mislead
Louisiana Planters
Senator Gore's resolution foreshad
owing a possible attempt to place an
excise tax on domestic sugar has gone
aa far now as an estimate of its prob
able revenue. Still, latest advices
from Washington do not change the
statement previously made that this
excise-tax plan has little chance of be
ing a serious factor in tariff discus
sion. ,
In reply to Senator Gore's resolu

ury McAdoo has forwarded to the sen
ate the official estimate that "an ex
cise tax one one cent per pound on
sugar produced In the United States
and Its Island possessions would pro

Sugar tariff discussion and legisla
tion are being given much attention
in Washington now. Recently abet
ter from Congressman W. P. Martin
of Louisiana, to Congressman Joseph
W. Fordney of Michigan, and the re
ply, have, attracted much attention.
Congressman Martin enclosed In
his letter an editorial from the New
Orleans Dally States and asked Ford
ney If this editorial correctly stated
the Republican position on the sugar
tariff. The. editorial declared that the
hope of the Louisiana sugar planters
lies alone! with the Democratic party,
and that the Republicans will prob
ably harm tha Louisiana planters. The
New Orleans paper had It figured out
that the Republicans will try to re
open the whole tariff question and If
unsuccessful! will do their best to beat
the suspension of the free-sugar
clause of the Wilson-Underwood .bill.
In reply to the letter and the edi
torial. Congressman Fordney wrote:

All Night Long; Has Already

Left on a carpenter's bench at th

Beretania and Fort streets, a Japanese
baby , girl, not more than three days
old, wailed and walled ana cauea ior

morning, dressed in a tiny Japanese
kimono and wrapped In a pink and
white, blanket ; 1
"I hear baby -cry,, leven 'clock:
twelve 'clock. I look. I no see, I. tell
me, somebody else house. Some more
I hear cry, I look, I no. find. All night

This morning I look more and Ms
baby sleep on end of bench."
Choy is married and has two ba
bies. He does not want any more,
but the tiny girl was not in want of
a home. Mrs. C. W. Cross, who lives
in a tenement over Choy 's store and
Is the Japanese wife of an American
carriage maker, simply grabbed It
when she saw it, and now no one else
can have it Today she smiled with
glee as Bhe showed the little bundle
In a blanket sleeping peacefully. ,
"I'm so glad," she laughed; "no
body take this baby from me. I want
baby, and I got now pretty little one."
She looked at the sleeping bundle
in a motherly way.
"God give her me," she said sol
emnly. "Suppose her mother come," asked
a detective.
"I give her hell." laughed Mrs.
Cross. "She no good. This now all
time my baby."
Immediately after Mrs. Cross took
the baby she sent her husband to the
police station to find out how she
could adopt Jt so no one could ever
claim it But anyhow, she said, she
would not give it up.
This morning, with half a dozen
Japanese girls and women around,
Mrs. Cross proudly cared for the
foundling.
If Mrs. Cross had not got the baby

the story back of which the baby was
found, would have taken it He says
he is sorry he did not see it first
"Me get him for my wife," he said,
with disregard of the baby's sex.
Mrs. Cross was told by Chief of De

Nomination
r Associated Press by Federal Wireless
CHICAGO, IIU Jan. 25. A forecast
of Republican victory and an intima
tion that Col. Roosevelt will not be
the . Republican candidate were con
tained in a statement issued today by
Charles D. Hides, chairman of the Re
publican national committee. The
atatement deals with the approaching
campaign and the Repubican hopes of
victory.
"All the information that I have,"
said Chairman Hilles, "is to the effect
that Cot. Roosevelt will not be a candidate-
for the - Republican nomina
tion." He did not aay, however, that
Col. Roosevelt would refuse the nomi
nation if tendered him.
He characterized the attitude of
Justice Hughes of tne supreme bench
aa "unknown."1
"No man is big enough to refuse
the presidency, in my opinion," he de
clared. ."Our candidate will be elect
ed." The victory of the Republicans
is a foregone conclusion, he pointed
out. .
In the belief that the matter of the
Prontotioa C2Tmitte budget . will be
settled -within 2i hours of its own ac
cord, no action on it was taken at a
meeting of that body this afternoon.
In bringing it before the committee
Chairman E. A. Berndt called atten
tion to the fact that the authorization
of the budget lies with the finance
and audit committee of the Chamber
of Commerce, and suggested that no
further action be taken by the Pro
motion Committee members.
Secretary A P. Taylor was author
ized to-address -letters to the Maui
and Kauai Chambers of Commerce
asking for a continuation of last
year's subscription to the Promotion
Committee.
Mr. Taylor was also , instructed to
take up with the different islands -the
question of having Island princesses
sent here for the Carnival to take part
in the floral parade on horseback.
Fred Potter, who had charge of sup
plying fish for the Hawaii exhibit at
the San Francisco exposition, will be
asked to quote figures on a supply for
permanent exhibits at San Francisco,
Venice and Los Angeles in order that
the committee may know whether or
not to take up the work of advertis
ing in this manner.
