Washington, D. C., Jan. 24.—Un

that one of her submarines sunk the
British liner Persia promise to revive
the diplomatic features of that dis

State department officials had no
dispatches on the subject today from
Ambassador Morgenthau. Neither
had they received any official word
from Ambassador Penfield at Vienna
transmitting Austria's official disavow
al of any connection'with the disaster,
reported unofficially last week.
Until the intimation came that Tur
key might assume responsibility it was
generally assumed in official quarters
that the cause of the sinking of the
liner would be numbered among the
mysteries of the war.
There is no indication of what turn
the case/will take in the light of the
latest information. None of the Teu

It was indicated today that any in

Turkey would not be sent until after
Vienna has been heard from.

INCOME TAX IS
Supreme Court of United
States Makes Ruling
on Important Law
JUSTICE WHITE
WRITES DECISION
Chief of Tribunal Upholds
Constitutionality in a
Sweeping Decision
Washington, D. C., Jan. 24, The
supreme court today upheld the con
stitutlonality of the income tax law.
Chief Justice White gave the court's
decision, sweeping aside-all the many
objections to Its constitutionality in
whole or in part.
Chief Justice White announced the
decision in the case of Frank R. Brush
aber, stockholder of the Union Pacific
railroad, who sought to enjoin the com
pany from paying the tax on the
ground that it was unconstitutional.
Most of Justice White's opinion was
directed toward overruling the conten
tion that the income tax amendment
tax provided a hitherto unknown pow
er of taxation. Going far into the his
tory of income tax legislation, the
chief justice concluded the argument
was without merit
Advancing to other points, the chief
justice held that the tax was not un
constitutional because it was retro
active.
The argument that the law was un
constitutional because labor, agricul
tural and horticultural organisations
and such were exempt, the chief jus
tice held, was answered by decisions
under the corporation tax law. He said
the point was only another illustration
of an erroneous assumption that the
tax was imposed under a new power
conferred on the government by the
sixteenth amendment, whereas, it was
power recognised to exist from the
beginning of the government and thus
decisions defining, taxing powers pre
viously rendered were applicable to ft.
Then, grouping a number of, other
contentions against the law, all based
on the clause of the constitution re
quiring uniformity in taxation, Chief
Justice White pronounced them all
lacking In merit, because" of previous
decisions which determined -that the
clause exacted only a geographical
uniformity.
The group included the contentions
that the tak lacked uniformity be
cause it:
Levies one tax on incomes of in
dividuals up to $20,000, and a higher
rate on incomes above that amount
allows a greater exemption for mar
ried persons than single ones, and
bases the tax on wealth alone:
Because It requires corporations, at
great expense, to perform the govern
ment's work, without compensation, of
collecting at the source
Because corporations indebted upon
lleved of labor and expense involved
in deducting and paying the taxes of
individuals on the income derived
from bonds
Because corporations required to
pay at the source would often pay
taxes for persons not required because
of exemptions to pay
Because bondholders, during the in
terval between the deducting and the
paying of the tax on their bonds, are
deprived of the use of their money
withheld
Because bondholders of corporations
which fail before they pay the tax
would be required to pay the tax al
though the corporation had deducted
the tax from the amount due the bond
holders.
Because of double payment of taxes
where corporations assume the -.»ay
ment of taxes on bonds
Becaise of the amount of the inter
est on indebtedness to be deducted
from gross Income of certain corpora
tions
Because individuals are allowed to
deduct from gross income dividends
paid them by corporations, but corpor
ations are not allowed to make such
deductions
Because Individuals whose income
is less than $20,000 are allowed to de
duct $3,000 or $4,000, but those receiv
ing more than $20,000 are not allowed
to make such deduction a second time
for the additional tax
Because greater deductions are al
lowed man and wife living together
than those living separately
Because owners of houses in which
they live are not compelled to esti
mate the rental value In making up
their incomes, while those living in
rented houses and pay rent are not
allowed, in making up their taxable
income, to deduct rent.

murder of Bert Akers. The Duran
brothers were exeouted legally at

French aeroplanes yesterday is re
ported by the Havas correspondent at
Salonikl and considerable damage
is said to have been done to ammuni
tion depots, the quarters of the gen
eral staff and the railroad station. The
correspondent also reports that the
Italian expeditionary force in Albania
is still to be attacked. The Bulgarians
who, in cooperation with Austrians,
captured the Albanian town of Berat,
are reported to be advancing toward
Avlona, which is held by the Italians.
Austrian troops are said to be mov

NO GAOUNOS FOR
New York, Jan. 24.—Complaints
that concrete emplacements for siege
guns have been erected in more than
a score of places threatening the de
fenses of New York harbor, Long
have been investigated by government
agents in the last six months. In no
instance were the suspicions of the
complainants verified.
The reports which reached govern
ment authorities in Washington were,
however, of such a character as to
compel investigation.
In one instance the government
agents were told that the, emplace
ments were being erected on Staten
island to support guns which could
demolish Forts Hamilton and Wads
worth and the lower part of New
York City. The investigators were
able to discover at the point Indicated
only a shallow concrete surface for a
tennis court. Reports of emplace
ments in Connecticut to command
Long Island sound and on the Hudson
river in range of the navy ordnance
depot at Iona island were found to be
equally baseless.
FLOOD MOVES TO
Peoria, 111., Jan. 24.—With the Illi
nois river still rising, residents along
the lowlands today are fleeing to safe

and interruption of light service is
feared unless the rise is soon checkedr
Hundreds of cabin boats along the
lower river have broken from their
moorings and either sunk or floated
away.
From Lewiston and Havana come
reports that the countryside around
those towns is flooded. The Spoon
river at Lewiston is reported out of
its banks, covering farm property to a
depth of four or five feet. The stage
of the water is at the highest point on
record. Railroad traffic is said to
have been discontinued out of Lewis
ton.

Wapello county has closed contracts
with outside firms for $136,000 worth
of bonds during the past two months.
The first batch was for $73,000 and the
last for $10,000 less. Warrants for the
first part of the year were announced
as having been taken up after the
first assignment of bonds had been
received at the court house. The sec
ond deal was only closed about two
weeks ago, the auditor and the treas
urer going to Davenport after the
money.
Out of the first group, totaling
$73,000, there was an allotment of
$27,000 made for the bridge and road
fund and the balance went to the gen
eral expense fund. AH of the last as
signment is to be used for regular
county expenses. Wapello county
was at a great deal of cost for
bridges and roads during 1915. The
three large structures, those over the
Des Moines river at Eldon, Chillicothe
and Eddyville, were all refloored and
some constructive done was done on
the west approach at the latter place.
Besides this there has been a Treat
deed of repairing and new work done
in all parts of the county, steel and
concrete bridges have replaced the old
wooden, affairs aiid cement culverts

CONFIDENT ABOUT
COMING ELECTION
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ARRANGE.
MENTS FOR NATIONAL CON
VENTION TALK HARMONY.
Chicago, Jan. 24 —Necessity for har
mony among the republicans was em
phasized by leaders who are here to
attend the meeting today of the sub
committee on convention arrange
ments of the national republican com
mittee.
Routine questions only are schedul
ed for today's meeting, members of
the subcommittee said, adding that in
the Interests of harmony it probably
would be decided to postpone the
selection of a temporary chairman un
til a later date.
When the subcommittee went Into
executive session it had before It blue
prints of the coliseum and a tentative
seating arrangement which would ac
commodate 12,500 persons, 1,300 more
than were provided for in the 1912
convention.
Informal conferences of committee
men preceded the executive session
and there appeared to be a general dis
position to forecast that all reasonable
concessions would be made to assure
harmony in the ranks of the party
which was divided after the 1912 con
vention.
None of the committeemen would
say that the harmony plans should ex
tend to the nomination of Col. Roose
velt as the republican standard bearer.
Franklin Murphy of New Jersey was
one of those most hopeful of harmony.
"I find there is a great disposition to
bring about harmony, if the progres
sives are not nasty," he said. "I think
the convention will be able to select
a candidate satisfactory to all the
elements of the party.
"I believe any strong man that the
republicans nominate can defeat Mr.
Wilson. It is a republican year and
we are certain of victory."
"The convention will be open mind
ed and deliberative," said Chairman
Charles D. Hilles. "The candidate will
he born in the convention. There will
be no arrangement In advance."
