sudden attack of a raiding squadron. .
r- An army at. least three times the
sise of the existing Tegular army is
needed for the protection of American
territory from invasion, he said, while V
he advanced the. important suggestion
that the term of enlistment be cut
down to one year in the infantry and
eighteen months in the other arms of
the service, with the recruits not obi
ligated by any definite term of service
in the reserves. Through this short
enlistment term,, with intensive in- :
struetioo, nen eonld be turned out able
to step back Into the military service
of the country in the event -of war .
with a sufficient knowledge of military
duties to enter the first line of defense .
without further preliminary training. .
Coast Defense Militiamen . ! r
He said that experience has shown
that the coast defense militiamen are
able to learn quickly how to handle -
the mortars and big guns of the eoaet ,.
defense posts and can be utilised to
advantage in the event of a crisis.
Brig.-Gen. William Crosier, chief of
ordnance, told the military committee ,
that the largest mobile' howitser in .
the American army is of 7.0 caliber,
and that only preliminary plane have -been
made- for 9.6 Inch guns of thia ,
type. No designs for a 16-ineh howit. ,
ter, . eemparable to 'the German ?

said,' and he commented that American '
military observers indicate that guns
of this size will be necessary , to . de-. '
