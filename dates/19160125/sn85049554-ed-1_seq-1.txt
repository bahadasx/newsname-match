to public lands and grazing were the
principal topics discussed by Dwlght
B. Heard, president of the American
National Live Stoqk Association, in his
address here today at the convention

pressed gratification at his .ability to
report that there Is now a disposition
on the part of the chief men of the
gracing states to oo-operate with the
oafttle men in securing some definite
form of federal control for the unap
propriated, unreserved publid lands.
Mr. Heard urged the question of mar
keting be given careful consideration.
"Conditions of the liye stock in
dustry during the pajit year have not
been entirely satisfactory," he aaid.
"There has been discontent among
feeders in the Mississippi valley, who
complain of unstable prices and ab
normal .fluctuations in the market
places. Investigation develops, flrat a
shortage of cattle in proportion to the
population, as compared with the past
three years, and, se.cpnd, that export of
beef products has revived. The ex
cess receipts at central markets were
less than 4 per cent over the previous
year and should nbt'alfect the market"

Chicago, Jan. 25.—Charles D, Hilles,
chairman of the republican national
committee, before leaving for New
York today, after attending the ses
sion of the sub-committee on arrange
ments for the party's national conven
tion discussed political questions, in
cluding the possible candidacy of Col
onel Roosevelt
"All the information I have is to
the effect that Colonel Roosevelt is not
a candidate for the republican nomina
tion," Chairman Hilles said. "He has
declined to permit his name to go on
the primary ballot in the only three
state where it has been suggested.
Takes Progressives at Their Word
"In the statement issued by the pro
gressive national committee it was made
plain that any reasonably satisfactory
man would be acceptable as republican
nominee. They Insisted that they
meant just "what they saidr, and we

candidate will be elected.

Chairman Hilles was speaking at the
Hamilton Club, at a luncheon in honor
of the national committee officials and
of the members of the sub-committee
of the national committee which met in
Chicago yesterday to make preliminary
arrangements for the national conven-'

Rough Draft of Platform.

It details a dozen particular points of

which Chairman Hilles said a winning
fight cdn be made by a united republi

Inefficiency in Government.
"Inefficiency," said Mr. Hilles, "has
marked the conduct of every depart
ment of the government—Inefficiency
in the selection of officials, inefficiency
and Insincerity in the' observance df
both the letter and spirit of civil ser
vice reform, Insincerity in the appoint

pines, Inefficiency and insincerity
amounting to downright deception in
the attempts to deceive the public re
garding the condition of the treasury,
where Secretary McAdoo has employed
the odious methods of high finance to
Juggle the treasury statements and
has sought to take advantage of the
unfamlliarity of the general' public
with the nation's accounts to conceal
the deplorable deficit.

greater insult was ever offered
to the intelligence of the American
voters than that Involved in Mr. Mc

After the War.
"Sagacious analysis of business con
ditions constantly warn the people to
be prepared for the Industrial warfare
which 1s certain to follow the restora

when the-last gun is fired on the bat
tlefields of Europe the millions of men
now under arms will return to the fac
tory and the mine and the farm, and
that unless that time finds this coun
try prepared to meet the restoration
of industrial competition there must
follow a day of reckoning here which
can spell nothing but disaster.
"Notwithstanding this, iMr. Wilson
failed in his recent message to propose
legislation on this subject suited to
the needs of the hour."

representations, the United States is
sending the British for foreign office.
The communication has been prepared
for transmission following the receipt
of the text of the act from Ambassador

Altho the representations do not take
the form of a protest for the reasdn
that the act is limited in its immediate
operation to British subjects, strenu
ous objection is directed against any
attempt to apply the legislation to
American trade.
The United Stat'es contends that the
proposed interference with trade is
illegal and that it would be impossible
to successfully aim a blow at Ger
many without doing great injustice to
American' commerce.

OF LUSITANIA CASE
Germany Eliminates Mention of Warn
ing Issued by German Embassy to
Lusitania Passengers—General Res
ervation of Admission of Wrong Do
ing on Part of Submarine Command
er la Said to Be Omitted.
Washington, Jan. 25.—Secretary
Lansing had before him today another
written proposal from Germany de
signed to bring about a settlement of
the controversy over the sinking of
the liner Lusitania. It was submitted
thru Ambassador von Bernstorff.
Altho strict secrecy surrounds the
negotiations, It was Indicated that the
proposal might result in a satisfactory
ending to the long standing negotia
tions on the subject.
It Is understood that in the latest
proposal Germany has agreed to elim
inate from the text of the agreement
any mention of the warning Issued by
the Germart embassy the day the Lu
sitania sailed and has left out her
proposed general reservation of ad
mission of wrong doing on the part of
her submarine commander. These
two points, It is understood, were con
tained in previous proposals and were
objected to by President Wilson.
Torpedoing Act of Reprisal.
Germany, it is said, reiterates that
the torpedoing of the Lusitania was an
act of reprisal for the British blockade
of the German coast. Regret is ex
pressed for the loss of American lives
and an idemnity is offered.
Attention Is called to the fact that
such forms of reprisal are discon
tinued.
Secretary Lansing's only comment
today on the published description of
Germany's latest proposal, was that It
was "speculation not justified by the
facts."
