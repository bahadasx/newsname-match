EFFECTS FUME
OF PRESIDENT
Must Arouse Apathy Qf Middle West
On Defense
Doubt As To Wilson's Candidacy If
isure
Washington, Jan. 24. On the trip
which President Wilson Is about to
take through the middle west will de
pend the fute of the national deJense
program in congreos. This trip, too,
is likely to have a vltalieffect updn
tho political fortunes of Air. Wilson.
Unless the president can stir the
middle wciit from its apathy toward
preparedness Ills plan for Increased
expenditures for the army and naVy
is certain to bo sldetiacked in con
gress. Alio If the president fails to
arouse suilleieiit enthusiasm to force
a victory ta this issue, his leadership
in the Democratic party will have
BUffe'red a blow from which it will he
hard for h.'m to recover. If the presi
dent goes tlown to defeat before-Wli-liam
J, Bryan and other Democratic
leaders In tho light that isjust beginN
nine, there is some doubt whether he
will consent to become a candidate
for renomination.
It is apparent, therefore, that the
trip on which the president will start
the last of this week will be one of
the most Important moves he has
made since ho entered the White
House. .
The preoenl situation In Washing
ton as regards national defense Is dis
couraging for those who had hoped to
see prompt action on this important
matter. Not in years has there been
a big question before congress about
which t:iere seems so much confusion.
It is becoming apparent that the pres
ident and Secretary Daniels are them
selves chielly responsible for the con
fused thought In congress on this sub
ject. The indifference of both the
president and his secretary of the
navy to the question of national de
fense a year ago and their statements
indicating that the army and navy
were all right, are now coming home

This chanpe of front on the part of

It is this very condition of affairs
that convinced the president and his
advisers that he must carry Iris fight
