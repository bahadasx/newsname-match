State Succeeds in Reading!

WOMAN HAS TROUBLE
REACHING COURT ROOM
Brother of Doctor's Chauffeur
is Called as Witness.
Says Brown Adimtted
Killing Mehr.
International New Servier:
PKOVIDFNFK, it. I.. Jan. 1'5.
The Möhr murder trial, which prin
cipals and onlookers thought would
end about the middle of next week,
today bids fair to last considerably
longer.
The sensational counter divorce
suits and property litigation pending
between Mrs. Flizabeth Frances
Möhr and Dr. Charles Franklin Möhr
at the time the physician was shot
to death, had been injected into the
trial of the widow for hiring three
gunmen to slay her husband.
Justice Stearns ruled out the di
vorce petitions as exhibits in the case
and held that the merits of their
contentions could, net he gone into.
Nevertheless the state proceeded in
reading a part of the woman's peti
tion to the jury and John J. Fitzger
ald, her chief counsel, today declared
he would insist on referring to the
divorce matter far enough to con
trovert the attorney general's insin
uation. that Mrs. Möhr had anything
to fear from possible evidence that
her husband might have introduced.
Will Lengthen Trial.
It is the divorce angle that will
lengthen the trial even though the
salacious details have been barred
by the court.
Mrs. Möhr had considerable diffi
culty in getting into the court house
because of the crowd that surround
ed her limousine when it drew up
to the College Hill curb.
Hundreds of the morbidly curious
gathered around her can speaking
encouragingly to the accused widow
and trying to shake her hand.
The state sprung a surprise the
first thin? today by calling another
negro. Herbert Healis. who said he
was a brother of the Möhr chauffeur,
George F. Healis.
Saw Note Written.
He testified he went to Bristol jail
to see George and talked to the
three accused negroes. He swore he
saw Brown write the alibi that Miss
Gertrude Stevenson handed over to
the police.
"We turned the trick all right. I
shot the doctor and Spellman shot
Emily Burger," Herbert Healis
quoted Victor Brown as saying in the
presence of George Healis and Henry
Spellman.
"Brown looked at Spellman."
Healis said, "and Spellman nooded
his head and said: 'Yes, I did it.'"
The negro identified another note
which lie said Brown wrote to him,
asking him and his brother. Nel
son Healis. to get the clothes of
Brown and Heorge Healis at the
Newport and Providence residences
of Dr. Möhr.
