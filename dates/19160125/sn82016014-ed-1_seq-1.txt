French Support Adds to String

London, Jan. 2 5. France has urged
Kngland to declare an immediate
blockade of Germany, without waiting
for further protest from neutrals, it
, was reported today on the eve of the
rormai discussion or tne Dioctcaae pro
posals by the government in parlia
ment. The pronunciamento of the French
officials has greatly strengthened the
position of Lord Charles Beresford and
other leading advocates of a stringent
blockade decree.
They predicted today that the sen
timent in their favor will be displayed
so strongly in the house of commons
tomorrow that the government will be
forced to take immediate action.
The blockade advocates today
claimed a large majority in parlia
ment in support of that policy. They
professed to have no definite informa
tion as to what course the government
has decided upon, but declared that
a blockade decree could go hand in
hand with adoption of the measure to
prove to the Germans that Kngland Is
in dead earnest.

In Topeka today there is a well de

party has again nailed down the negro
vote in Kansas. Another idea that
seems to gather considerable support
is to the effect that the rejection of
the "Birth of a Nation" film by the
state censors and appeal board was
based on the protests of persons who
did not see the picture. Certainly the
censors had not consulted a large
number of persons who saw the pic
ture. Even wives of members of the state
appeal board today went on record as
declaring the picture the greatest mo
tion picture production they had seen.
These women were also unable to see
the "immoral" features of the pic
ture which were criticised in the re

When the State Journal todav
called the wives of members of the
state appeal board and wives of other
state officials, requests were made for
personal opinions concerning the pic
ture. These ladies were also asked as
to immoral features of the film and
their personal feelings as to race ha

appeal board are: Arthur Capper,

Proper care of Mrs. Woodrow Wil

meeting of the executive committee in1
charge of the entertainment of the
president. F. E. Whitney and W. O.
Kigby are two new members added to
the committee today.
"Everyone wants to see Mrs. Wilson
as much if not more than the presi
dent," said Robert Blair, "and we
should see to it that she receives the
proper amount of care and homage.'
Didn't Want Job.
3. N. Dolley expressed the same sen
timent but refused to make any sug
gestions as to the personnel of the
female staff to meet and call on Mrs.
Wilson. It was finally decided that
Mrs. E. E. Murphy of Leavenworth,
Mrs. James Orr of Atchison. Mr
Arthur Capper. Mrs. Jay E. House,
Mrs. W. E. Atchison, Mrs. James M.
Lewis and Mrs. W. O. Rigby should
plan the entertainment and homage
due the "first lady of the land."
A multiplicity of perplexing prob
lems confronting the committee were
unfolded and solved. First, came the
questions of music. L. M. Penwell,
chairman of the music committee, an
nounced that arrangements had al
ready been made to have Marshall's
band in the parade and to furnish mu
sic during the meeting.
Military In It.
Word was received from Adjutant
General Martin that the Regimental
band would be glad to march in the
parade as well as the militia. J. jn.
Dolley suggested that the Disciplinary
bar-d from the Disciplinary Barracks
at Fort Leavenworth, be obtained.
This band is one of the finest in the
country and is composed of military
prisoners confined in the big Disci
plinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth
for military offenses. The band has
played at various public affairs with
out a guard.
W. O. Rigby and F. E. Whitney
were appointed to serve on a platform
committee to determine the number
of guests who could be invited to

Story About Islanders Being

Man Can Have as Many Wives

New York, Jan. 25. Dr. Frederick
A. Cook, who started some little talk
in the newspapers about the north
pole, has returned to his native Brook
lyn, bringing fresh discoveries to a
palpitating world.
The doctor declares the wild men
of Borneo are not wild and the doctor
ought to know, as he has been pas
timing among them for several
months.
Instead, from his story, they appear
to have reached a high stage of devel
opment in which the women do all the
work.
The doctor arrived on the Norwegian-American
liner, Kristianiaf jord,
from Bergen.
"I have discovered," he announced.
the wild men of Borneo. They are
not wild. I found them to be a race
of tall, well built foik of fair com
plexion. It is a base calumny to call
them wild. Their only uncivilized
traits are head hunting and poly
gamy. Utopia of Feminism.
To prove that the wild men are not
wild at all, the doctor went on to say
that the women have taken things
into their own hands in Borneo. It is
a Utopia of feminism.
"They have taken over the man
agement of the tribal governments as
well as building the fires and putting
out the cat. They refuse to let the
men do any work. A man is entitled
to as many wives as he believes neces
sary to support h:'m in comfort and
the station to which he has been ac
customed. "The men bear hatred for their
enemies," continued Brooklyn's great
est explorer, "but they were very
friendly toward u. We had a lovely
visit of seven months with them."
-It was about a year ago that the
man who put Brooklyn in the date
lines felt the yearning to discover
something come over him. He start
ed out with F. P. Thompson, a nat
uralist, and E. S. Brooke, a photo
grapher, to climb Mount Everest, the
highest peak in the world. They did
not even get a peek at the big hill.
The British authorities at Calcutta
refused without explanation the re
quests of the doctor and his compan
ions. Went to Borneo.
However, the doctor just had to
discover something, so he picked out
the wild men of Borneo as needing
discovery most. He went to the Phil
ippines and then made the journey to
the island in a 28-foot boat, he says.
"I have returned to the United
States," he said, "because there are
five bills before congress leading up
to an investigation of my claims as
discoverer of the pole. This investi
gation will clear and vindicate me."

When Dr. E. H. Ballew, tooth print

SINK A BIG LINER
Norseman Down, but Details
Not Given Out.
Largest Victim Yet, Except
Lusitania and Arabic.
liOitdnn, Jan. 25. The Dominion
liner Norseman has bocn sunk by a
submarine, affording to a Liverpool
dispatch to the Kxchnnge telt-graph
toilu y.
The Norseman is a 10,750 ton steel
screw steamer owned by the British
& North Atlantic Steamship company,
of Liverpool, and flies the British
flag.
She has been in service in the At
lantic, and presumably was sunk in
the waters around the British Isles. If
this report Is correct, she is the largest
liner, except the Lusitania and Arabic,
which has been sunk In British waters
by a submarine.
One or two other steamers of the
Dominion line, are reported to have
been commandeered by the British
government for service as troop ships.
It is possible that the Norseman was
in troop service and that she may
have been sunk in the Mediterranean.
The Norseman was built at Belfast
in 1897. She is 600 feet long with a
62-foot beam. Lloyds list her captain
as G. Berry.
