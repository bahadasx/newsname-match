-Special to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Jan. 25.?The first two i <
weeks of the'legislative session of 1916 ! 1
v served to give a line on tue probable | s
results of the session. Both bodies j1
have been holding night sessions, ana i
there is a general disposition to get j ^
through with the work. The entire: t
forty days will probable be taken, how- i c
ever. 'The ways and means committee i
is trying to get the appropriation bill j
ready for introduction by February 1.; t
Some 500 bills were introduced during ! i
i
tne first two weeks. They cover almost j *
' every conceivable subject. Outstand- !
ing in the work done so far is the c
progress made in making drastic the : s
* prohibition laws, the strong sentiment' I
shown for woman's suffrage, although a
it was defeated, ana tne ngnt on ine ?j
abuse of free scholars-hips in the state j ?
institutions of higher learning. ' r
Poth houses meet tonight at 8 s
o'clock, having adjourned over from t
Fridav. \ s
Early last week the house passed > 8
the Liles bill, imposing a chain gang 1
sentence, without the alternative of a s
fine, for violation of the new liquor ; s
laws. <Within the next few days the c
house will probably take up and dispose
of the measure to place $50,000 ?

making drunkenness on the highways ; t

ratification and will take its place on 1
the statute books. In the house an , i
amendment will be offered to the bill t
passed by tne senate prohibiting the ; r
V newspapers in the stale from publish- , r
m ing liquor advertisements. The house ' a
f amendment will prohibit news stands t
and newsboys from selling any paper , <3
or magazine or other publication print
ed outside the state and containing
liquor advertisements. ! j
L Woman Suffrage Defeated. a
While the resolution introduced by c
1 Representative McCullough of Green- ' a
ville providing for the submission to t
the people of a constitutional amend- c
-"-vnt for woman's suffrage was defeat j s
' ed in the house, tae strength which ! v
was shown by the movement was sur- | c
prising. It would have taken a two s
t thirds vote of each house to submit 1 s
* the resolution to the people. The vote s
to'kill the resolution was 61 to 51. All
thr?e members of the Xewberry dele- j e
; sadon voted to put the measure to1
; <death. Over in the senate the amend-1 f
* ir.ent proposed to be submitted to the f
people allowing women to hold the of- ^
fice of notary public failed to receive s
the necessary two-thirds vote. This $
" amendment was proposed by Senator a
Carlisle of Spartanburg. ; *

\ew York plan.'' whereby students

or independent, which may

)f representatives of denominational
ollegesand ethers interested was held
n Spar anbr.rg on the 12th of January,
u which time it was agreed to push |
his plan. Among the names of those i
mentioned as having been present at |
his meeting is that of Dr. J. Henry!
LIarms, president of Newberry college, j
Statistics showing the glaring abuse I
>f these free scholarship privileges j
lave been used so effectively that it j
;eems practically certain that some ac- j
ion will be taken by the legislature.
In this connection, ilie report 01 .\ir.,
>V. H. Hand, state -high school inspec-,
or, in which he urges consolidation of
olleges, is of interest.
Consolidation of Colleges,
Consolidation of Chicora college and j
he College for Women is highly comnended
in the annual report of W. H.;
land, state high school inspector.
- "Tne recent consolidation of Ohicora j
allege and the College for Women," j
ays Mr. Hand, "ought to put the peo>le
of this state to thinking. If ever i
;ny people were guilty of the inexcus- j
ible educational waste, the people of
louth Carolina are. With a total white 1
>opulation of 679,161, a total high ;
chool enrollment of 10,481, a total of
nit 673 pupils above the t'nird high j
chool year, and a total of $307,178,- :

rave taken the trouble to ascertain
'lie total value of these 21 plants, the

idered. some of the religious denomi
ation6 of the state are indulging in \
ven grater wastefulness.
"Since the consolidation of these >
wo colleges we have left 20. If by i
Mrther rnn<:niidarinn the number could ;
ie reduced to not more t'nan 12, the;
tate, as a whole, and ev^ry religious !

titution. I
A Delicate Topic.
"Four years ago in mv report when i
spoke of this matter of consolidation ;
ome of my best personal friends grew j
xcited and rushed into print to charge '
n-e with speaking unsy.mpathetically,.
f not iconoclastically. I spoke then,:
.s I do now, with a genuine desire to
ee our people cease wasting their
noney and their labor in keeping alive
i multiplicity of struggling colleges,
ome oT which can never rise to a high j
-tate of efficiency, when they might |
asily put their money and efforts into
l dozen institutions that would soon
>e aible to compete with t'ae best in
he land. I know that what I am sayng
is not popular, but I know that I
;m right.
"The fact is hundreds of our people
ealiae the folly of the policy we are
[ purs-uing and they feel about it as
! do. But whenever you speak of at mming
to remedy the situation, almost
every one is afraid that you nave
designs on his little pet college. He
begins to U-mexit the loss of ancient j
associations, traditions and attachments.
Sentiment is an excellent thing,
out it seems a pity to waste it on a
pile of brick and mortar hopelessly in
lebt or on a little college starving for
students or begging for its existi-nce.
"The day is coming when our people
will be wiser. As their burdens
?row their wisdom will increase. Ultimately
they will demand relief, and
at the proper time their leader will
be ready!"
I'rged in !J)13 Message.
In his annual message of 1913, Governor
Blease urged the classification of
state institutions to the end that the various
departments of these institutions
might not be depulicated so many
limes?the co-operation of the various j
institutions to the end that certain de-j
- - I
partments in each might be strengtnened.
The recommendation of Mr.
Hand carries out this idea advanced by
Governor Blease. It is the only sensible
plan for the state to adopt.
Compulsory Education.
The house by a vote of 61 to 47 killed
. .
the Harper bill to submit to tne people
at the next general election the
question of compulsory education, the
county to be the unit. (Hie house took
the view that compulsory education
was progressing very well under the
- 1 " ' *i 1 x _
present law, ana mat it was unwise lo ;
make any changes in the law at this
time.
The Engrossing Department.
For years there has been an attempt
at each succeeding session of the legislature
to require the employment of
stenographers in the engrossing de^
A ? i. 1 I
panmeni, msieau ui me juuug iau,t
clerks. Senator Verner of Oconee introduced
the measure again before t'nis
legislature, and it has passed the senate
by a big majority. It will now go
before the house, where there seems
a strong probability of its passing. It
was urged in behalf of the measure
that it would give more efficient work
and at the same time cut down the expense
of this department.
Two-Cent Passenger Fare.
The house has passed the two-cent
mileage hill. This measure has been
before the legislature for several years.
The bill was passed by a vote of 59 to
37. It came o?.er from the 1915 session,
having been introduced by Messrs.
Moore and Gray don of Abbeville. Railroads
of less than fifty miles in length
were exempted from the operation of
the measure. There was a spirited debate
in the house, but the advocates
of the reduced fare easily had the advantage
of numbers from the start.
The President Invited.
A concurrent resolution has been
passed by both houses urging President
Wilson to visit the legislature and |
make an address on preparedness. The
president is arranging an itinerary of
:i number cf places which he will visit
in the interest of thise cause, and it
was felt that he might be induced to
come to South Carolina. The South
Carolina senators in Washington have
promised to use their influence io se
cure the president's acceptance of the
invitation.
Supervision of Warehouses.
There is a bill in the house of representatives
which is creating a considerable
stir. It provides for the inspection
and general supervision of all
public warehouses for the storage of
cotton, by the state warehouse commissioner,
a small fee being charged,
in proportion to the amount of business
done, to defray the expenses of
the act. It is urged on behalf of those
supporting the measure that there is
as much reason for estate supervision
<"f these warehouses as for state supervision
of banks, cotton being the basis
of credit in the South, and the founda
?-Vhl^'U + Vi Ara/?if r\f f'Vio I
lion upon wuivju tuc vjcuii, v/i
banks rests. The measure is being
vigorously fought by the Standard and
other corporation warehouses.
lural Credits.
The legislature may reach the discussion
of the rural credits measures
this week. The bill 'by Senator >9herard
of'Anderson, carrying a bond issue
of 'en million dollars, has received a
divided committee report, the majority
report, however, being faivorable to the
bill. There are many different ideas
in the legislature on the subject of
rural credits, and ihey will all prob
ably we well threshed out. This sub-1
ject, which has to do with providing
he means for home ownership, is on^
of the most important demanding the
attention of the law-makers at t'nis
time.
Taxation.
The matter of taxation is still to
"omo up. The names of the members
of the tax commission have been seut
to the senate by Governor Manning for
I r- J.? J _ ~
, connrmauon, ana a uni iui me i trpuai
:>\ lie act establishing that commission
has been introduced in the senate, and
a'so a measure to amend the act by
putting in tne board of review, which
was left out by mistake when the act
was passed last year. The Columbia
correspondent of the Xews and Cou
rier says that Governor Manning will
deal'with this subject in a special message,
and that it is not likely that
cither house will take any definite action
until this message is received.
The Elections.
The elections will be held on Wednesday.
An unexpected development
came the latter part of last week in
the talk of opposition to the re-election
of Associate Justice T. B. Fraser, the
name cf Representative Geo. S. Mower
? ^ ^rv Artf Arl rt M O
(Jl uei ry ucnig uicuuuucu as "
probable candidate against Judg^Fraser.
Mr. Mower is speaker pro tempore
of the house.
The warehouse commissioner's race
is still attracting much interest. Senator
John L. McLaurin, who was last
it-coi.- r>nrir>r<spii hv fhp State Farmers'
union and the South Carolina Warehouse
association, is opposed by
Messrs. F. M. Cary of Pickens ani
John J. McMahan of Columbia.
Mrs. Virginia Green Moody, state
librarian: Carlton 'W. Sawyer, comptroller
general, and F. H. MdMftster,
insurance commissioner, will be re
elected to succeed themselves without
opposition. This will also be the case
of Circuit .Judges .James W. DeVore
and S W. G. Shipp, of (he 11th and
12th circuits. The race for code commissioner
lies between J. Rion McKis.

WORK IN NEWBERRY COUNTY
???
Mr. T. Mills Gives Summary of
What Has Been Done During
the Past Year. .
??
The following is a summary of work
performed by T. M. Mills, demonstration
agent for Newberry county, during
the year 1915:
Number of visits, 821; number of
miles traveled, 5,322. j
Hogs inoculated, 1W; value ol tnese
hogs, $1,000.
During the years 2,469 bulletins were
distributed, 608 letters written and 28
meetings held, with an estimated attendance
of 3,725. <
Thirty-one schools were visited and
15 news articles written.
Two silos were built.
Mr. Mills brpught 20 pure 'bred cattle,
30 pure bred hogs and 4 pure bred
i horses and jack6 into the county.
Fruit trees pruned and sprayed numbered
1,500, and 300 were ordered for
farmers.
The demonstrations reported were:
Corn 50 acres, average yield per acre
44 bushels. Cotton 82 acres, average
yield per acre 500 pounds lint cotton.
Oats 4 acres, average yield 50 bushels
per acre. Vetch and oats for hay 22
acres, average yield 1 Vz tons. Vetch
. *
and oats for seed 3 acres, average
yield 37 tuisneis per acre. .Demonstration
plots have been conducted successfully
at two schools?Hunter-De
Walt and Little Mountain.,
Mr. Mills has assisted in the following
farmers' organizations: Farmers'
union, reorganized; County Live Stock
association, organized; Community
Fair association, organized.
He assisted in getting prices and
getting farmers to buy co-operatively
in car lots about 15,000 tons of fertilizer.
This was nearly all home mixed
at a considerable saving to the farmer.
- ? -*iJ- TT7 * 1 t* ^ _
in co-operation wian.vrass want; jiae
Wise, Canning club agent, the farm
demonstration agent placed 50,000 tin
cans in the hands of farmers at car lot
prices, thus encouraging farmers to
save more fruits and 'vegetables than
usual.
"I 'nave conducted a free column in
The Herald and News, which, I am
sorry to say, they have not used as
much as they should, but we hope to do
better this year.
"Besides the foregoing, I have ordered
inoculation for legumes, free of
cost, for the farmers, encouraged the
j sowinng and plan .ing of legumes?fae
saving of seed for home use and some
to sell. Newberry has the honor of
gathering- 15,000 to 20,000 'bushels of
burr closed seed in 1915, worth at least
$15,000.
"I have also assisted many farmers
| in selling their surplus products and
in cimbatting crop pests and in various
other ways."
This is a summary of things done
by County Demonstration Agen T. M.
Mills in 1915, and he has planned
greater things for 1916. "Our motto
is, 'Make the good better and the l*et
ter best,'" says Mr. Mills, "ana we
shall never rest till it is accomplished."
