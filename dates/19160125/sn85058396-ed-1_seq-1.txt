and enormous quantities of munitions.
; ' Route of Turks Decisive.
The Reuter dispatch says:
"The rout of the Turks in the battle
which resulted in them being driven
into Erzerum appears from later ac
counts to have been even more de
cisive than shown in the first, reports.
Apart from the Ottoman losses in
actual battle, the Russians captured
during the pursuit fifty officers and
4,000 men. They also took scores of
machine guns and enormous quanti
ties of munitions.
( "The influx of 120,000 Turks in Erz
erum is considered to reduce the de-
' fensive power of the fortress.
"In the Prlpet marsh region of Vol-
, hynia the Russian positions are stat
ed to be only four versts (2 2-3 miles)
,, from Plnsk, so successful have been
, the Russians in recent actions."

details confirm previous reports that
the attack of the enemy, delivered
yesterday near the mouth of the Yser
river, was checked by the fire of our
guns. The Germans were unable to
come out except at a single point,
where several groups were successful
in penetrating into our first line of
trenches. They were, however, im
mediately driven out after a very
spirited fight in which hand grenades
were used. These caused the Ger
mans perceptible losses.
Artois Move Fails.
"In the Artois section the movement
of the enemy yesterday againBt our
positions east of Nueville St, Vaast,
which resulted in complete failure,
was resumed at the end of the day in
greater strength. After a further ex
plosion of mines, accompanied by a
violent bombardment, the (Germans
delivered an attack along a front of
1,500 yards in the angle made by the
roadway from Artois to Lens with the
road from Nueville St. Vaast to The
lu8. They were driven back to their
lines by our fire. At two points
where our trenches had been shatter
ed by mine explosions, they were suc
cessful in occupying certain craters,
but from most of these they were al
most immediately expelled."
"In the Vosges we have carried out
an effective bombardment of tho posi
tions of the enemy at Ban de Sapt."

Review of War Situation.
Monastir and Gievgeli, southern
Serbian towns held by the Teutonic
allies, have been attacked again by a
snuadrou of French aeroplanes. Bom
bardment of Nancy, France, by the
Germans has been renewed. On the
principal fronts tho great bulk of the
armed millions remains inactive, with
only aerial battle, big gun bombard
ments and occasional thrusts with
small forces of infantry to "break the
monotonv of the deadlock.
The French aerial raid was made
by a squadron of 1G aeroplanes, some
of which traveled 1&0 miles to the
attack. It is estimated that 100 per
sons were killed or wounded at Giev
geli. All the French machines re
turned safely.
The bombardment of Nancy was
carried on by German guns of long
range. Paris reports that only two
persons wore wounded. German aero
planes also attacked the city but in
flicted little damage.
Montenegrins Falling Back.
Tho remnants of Montenegro's
troops, driven from their own land,
are falling back through Albania,
fighting as they go. Apparently the
main Montenegrin army as an organ
ized unit has ceased to exist for the
cable reports speak of the present
hostilities as guerilla warfare.
The report comes from Constanti
nople that the famous German field
marshal, Baron von der Goltz, has
been appointed commandor-ln-chief of
the Turkish forces In the Caucasus.
The field marshal will be opposed by
Grand Duke Nicholas, who, with a re
inforced army, has recently won a
series of victories which have brought
Erzerum within the range of his
guns.
Heavy Fighting Resumed.
After a long period of comparative
Inactivity in Belgium, heavy fighting
has broken out, with the initiative in
the hands of the Germans. The
Trench official report of today states
thai after a heavy bombardment, the
Germans launched an attack with ln-
, fantry over a front of 1500 yards near
i Nieuport. At some places they buc-
' ceeded in occupying French positions
of the first line but, Paris reports.
' were expelled subsequently from most
! of this territory.
