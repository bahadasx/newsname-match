FORDNEY MAkIs STAND
OF REPUBLICANS PLAIN
Shows How Democratic Inter
ests in South Try to Mislead
Louisiana Planters
Senator Gore's resolution foreshad
owing a possible attempt to place an
excise tax on domestic sugar has gone
as far now as an estimate of its prob
able revenue. Still, latest advices
from Washington do not change the
statement previously made that this
excise-tax plan has little chance of be
ing a serious factor in tariff discus
slon.
In reply to Senator Gore's resolu
tion of Inquiry. Secretary of the Treas
ury McAdoo baa forwarded to the sen
nte the official estimate that "an ex
else tax one one cent per pound on
sugar produced in the United States
and Its Island possessions would pro-
. duce $41375.733."
Sugar tariff discussion and legisla
tion are being given much attention
In Washington now. Recently a let
ter from Congressman W. P. Martin
of Louisiana, to Congressman Joseph
W. Fordney of, Michigan, and the re
ply, have attracted much attention.
Congressman Martin enclosed In
his letter an editorial from the New
Orleans. Dally States and asked Ford
ney If -this editorial correctly stated
the Republican position on the sugar
tariff. ' The editorial declared that the
hope of the Louisiana sijgar planters
lies alone with the Democratic party,
and that; the . Republicans will prob
ably harm the Louisiana planters. The
New Orleans paper had it figured out
that the Republicans will try to re-
; open' the whole tariff question and if
.unsuccessful will do their best to beat
the suspension of the freesugar
. clause f ths -Wilson-Underwood bill.
In reply to the letter and the edi
torial. Congressman; Fordney wrote:

Although Attorney General Gregory

In Attorney Vaughan's explanation
of the department's delay in approv

largely to blame, Mr. Vaughan stat

In an opinion handed down today,

Circuit Judge C. W. Ashford ex-
presses the belief that automobiles
used by army officers on military res

The opinion states that m tne De

Charles T. Wilder, In which the form

Capt. Cassels made no return for

SHANGHAI, China, Jan; 25. Gun
Win i Pan, military governor of Shan
tung province, has declared his in
dependence of Yuan Shih-Kal The
garrison at Tslnan, the capital city,
has gone over to the revolutionists.
This province Is the second within a
week adjoining Peking to go over to
the revolutionary party. Shantung
province : Is directly south of Peking
and on the main line of the railroad
from Peking south.
"Tslnan Is situated on the Hwang Ho
river and Is considered a strong mili
tary post. It is the junction of the
two railroads of the province, one
leading to Peking and the' other , to
Talngtau, captured by the Japanese
from the Germans. Prominent offi
cials who know the situation In Shan
tung state that the action of the mili
tary governor means that the entire
province will go over to the revolt
tlonists.
Foreign missionaries have left Tsln
an for Tsingtau and many other for
eigners are leaving this province. Tho
revolutionists have now encircled Pe
king and the province of Chili with
the exception of one point, Honan,
which still is controlled : by the mon-
achists.
Three Strongholds Left.
With Shantung going : over to the
revolutionists, only three! strong prov
inces still cling to the monarchy, these
being Chili, Honan and Hupeh. Other
provinces which have not yet joined
the revolutionary movement are not
In favor of a monarchial government.
Yuan Shih-Kai has ordered his
troops at the front to march to the
province of Hupeh to make a stand
against the forces of revolutionary
armies In Yunnan and Sze Chuen. This
move is made to prevent the revolu
tionary troops from taking the Hankow-Peking
railroad, which is neces
sary to the monarch.
The revolutionary government in
Yunnan has despatched a commission
er to the French province of Annam
on th6 south, to make a contract for
ammuition. The revolutionary party
has already ordered 15 machine guna,
five field guns and 10,000 rifles from
French firms in Hanoi, the capital of.
Annam. French capitalists in Annam
have loaned the revolutionary party
5,000,000 francs for carrying on a cam
