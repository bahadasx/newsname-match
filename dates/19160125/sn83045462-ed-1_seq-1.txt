STIRRINGLY URGES
ADEQUATE DENSE
Representative Mann Declares
Nation Should Be
Prepared for War.
u/nin n cDCMn mm i ihmq
NOW. NOT BILLIONS LATER
Regards Strife With England More
Likely Than With
Germany.
Tn a brief but carefully worded and
at times impassioned speech. Representative
Mann of Illinois, minority
leader of the House, today came out
emphatically for national preparedness |
and for strengthening of national defenses
all along the line, as well as
the upbuilding; of home industries as
part of the plan.
Mr. Mann's speech was regarded as
the more significant from the fact that
heretofore he has been regarded as opposed
to military expansion, and was
recognized as a "little navy" advocate.
In the course of his remarks Mr. Mann
made the statement that he regarded
rtrti v\iin nrmiann hp more iiKeiy inan
war with Germany in the future.
Ought to Look to Future.
Representative Mann said he had been
recognized heretofore as o-pposed to a
i large standing army and was properly
known as a "little navy'* man. "But,"
he said, "wise men ought to look forward
and be prepared today for what
may come tomorrow. The greatest
i struggle of the world is now going on
j among all the great nations of the;
world except the United States. Each
side is not only fighting for its own
i existence, but each side fighting to put
I the other side out of existence. Xoth!
ing like it has ever been seen before.
No one knows what will result from
| the present war, nor whether it may
finally lead this country into a struggle
for uur own preservation.
United States Should Prepare.
"I think the present conflict is liable
Tina HKeiy to last for many years be|
fore the mastery is determined," said
I Mr. Mann, "and it seems to me that
the part of wisdom for us is to thoroughly
prepare ourselves for what it is
possible may come."
This sentiment was loudly applauded
on the republican side, apparently
almost unanimously, aiul by approximately
half the democrats. Mr. Mann
went on to say that it will be expensive
to prepare for maintaining peace.
"Two years ago." he said, "no one
wotild have dreamed of the possibility
of the expenditures already involved
by the European nations.
"We can better afford today to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars, or a
few billions of dollars to avoid war,
than a few years later to have to
spend untold billioins after the trouble
begins." sa d Mr. Mann
Again the republicans applauded
vigorously and the democrats lukewarmly.
Should Start Preparations.
"ft is wise for us now to commence
our preparations, for we know that !
when the time comes we would spend
our last dollar to defend our homes."
Mr. Mann said we should increase the
I standing army, add to the coast fortij
fixations and provide an adequate navy
j to protect the seas.
"I have more fear." said Mr. Mann,
j "of war with England than of war
with tjermanv. I think that we ought
| to provide these great measures of defense
as emergency measures, and
aside from the routine; not as a partisan
effort, but in loyalty to our
country."
Would Build Up Industries.
j He thought further that the upbuildI
irig of home industries should be provided.
"so that in case of becoming
involved in war we can live within
I ourselves. |
"If there ever was a time in the history
of our country," said Mr. Mann,
"when we ought to invite and receive
expressions 'rom all sides, this is the
time, so tnaf t^ut of it may come a
policy whicn will enable us to uphold
in the future our national honor and
our modern civilization, which I fear j
| may nreaK flown on this side of the I
water.
Decision to Be Reached.
"We must decide whether we shall
take the chance of disaster or to pro- :
vide now against that disaster," said ;
Mr. Marin in conclusion. As he took '
his seat he was greeted with prolonged
(applause on tire republican sidfe, in;
| which many democrats joined.
VON DER GOLTZ TO LEAD '
TURK ARMY IN CAUCASUS
LONDON. January 25.?The report
comes from Constantinople that the
famous German field marshal, Baron
von der Qoltz, has been appointed commander-in-chief
of the Turkish forces
in the Caucasus. The field marshal.
; who was sent from Germany several
years ago to reorganize the Turkish
!' army, is one of the most redoubtable |
of Turkey's military leaders and his J
.. t rlnuKtlovc ??
th#? successes of the Russians in that !
theater.
The field marshal will he opposed by
' rand Duke Nicholas, who. with a re!

NEW FORM OF TETANUS.
Disease Is Serious. Prof. Laveran
Tells French Academy of Sciences.
PARIS. January 27,. 5:20 a.m.?prof.
Laveran of the Pasteur Institute de- j
scribed at a meeting of the Academy of j
Sciences today a new form of tetanus,
j which has been investigated by Dr. Bazv. |
It makes its appearance from thirty to!
j fifty days after the wound had been re-|
ceived, whether the patient had a pre-j
ventive injection of the serum or not, and
it can occur without apparent cause, although
it manifests itself more frequently
after operations or on the fresh outbreak
of inflammation in wounds.
The disease is serious, as death occurs
in from one-third to one-half of the cases.
Dr. Baz" recommends that injections of
anii-ieuimiB serum be gi\eu every week
PRESIDENT TO ASK 1
FOR TARIFF BOARD
Commission Will Be Treated in i
Special Message to
Congress.
SUBJECT OF CONFERENCE !
WITH MAJORITY LEADER
Representative Kitchin Believes,
Federal Trades Body Can Deal
Adequately With the Subject.
Representative Kitchin of
North Carolina, democratic leader
of the House, conferred with]
President Wilson today about the!
President's intention to ask Con-;
gress to create a tariff eommis- j
sion which shall he clothed with i
nowers to make careful investisra-!
tions into trade affairs bearing!
upon the tariff, cost of production
here and abroad and all the fac- [
tors that enter into customs questions.
The President confirmed
the reports that he has determined
to recommend a commission, and
told Mr. Kitchin that he believes
such a commission will be vitally
important in view of the possibilities
of severe trade adjustments
after the European war. The
President, it is understood, will i
address Congress in a special mes- j
sage on the subject.
' Mr. Kitchin said that personally he j
had taken no definite position on the j
subject, although he had felt that the!
powers to be given a tariff commission {
niight safely and wisely be intrusted to 1
the federal tr^de commission, which already
has powers for the collection of '
important data touching upon trade
and the tariff.
Has Conference With Members.
He also said he had not conferred
with members of the ways and means
committee, hut believed it probable
that the committee, if it acts, will favor
such a commission as the President is
likely to recommend. He had been told
that northern democrats were especially
favorable to a commission.
"I have no particular choice about
the matter," said Mr. KItchin. "I had ;
thought that all subjects relating to j
the tariff?investigations, reports to ;
Congress, etc.?might be assembled in
the trade commission, which now has 1
wide powers, but it is immaterial as to 1
what body is given direct powers." 1
The President himself, until within i
the last few months, has inclined to i
giving further power to the federal '
trade commission, but the urgent demand
of lar^" business organizations
like the United States Chamber of :
Commerce lias been strongly favorable 1
to an independent body clothed with '
extensive authority relating to the
tariff.
Mr. Kitchin said he believed his com- i
mittee will report a bill to prevent j '
(Jumping' in tnis country of cheap
foreign goods after the European war, 5
but does not yet know the details of 1
the bill. The measure, if the commit- ]
tee's views now are followed, will be
along the lines of the Underwood bill 1
as originally reported to the House and
stricken out in the Senate when the
present tariff was passed bv that body.
This would impose heavy additional
duties upon goods sent to this country :
at ruinously cheap prices. i
President Wilson today talked with ,
a committee of the executive committee
of the socialist party of the court- '
try, headed by Representative London
of New York, the only socialist member
of the House. The visitors urged
upon the President three things: I. j
Support of the resolution introduced in I
the House by Representative Lonuon ?
calling upon the F'resident to convene
a Con^reHs of neutral nations to offer
mediation to the belligerents in Kurope;
2. support of the movement for 1
bettering the political and civic status
"of the Jews of Kurope, especially those
iti Russia, and 3. preparedness. 1
The socialists told the President that >
a declaration by Fonfrress in favor of
calling an immediate conference of for- .
eif?n nations will strengthen the hands ,
of the F'resident in his efforts for international
peace. The socialists pro- '
pose that if such a neutral nation conference
is held the basis of the deliberations
shall be evacuation of invaded
territory; liberation of oppressed nationalities;
referendum by the populations
of Alsace-I^orraine. Finland and
Poland as to their allegiance or independence;
removal of the political arid '
civic disabilities of the Jewish people i
everywhere; freedom of the seas; concerted
disarmament and establishment
of an international court of arbitration.
with the commercial boycott as
tiie means of punishment for disobedience.
James H. Maurer. president of the
Pennsylvania State Federation of I^ibor,
told the F'resident the labor organizations
in bis state are opposed to
further increases in the army and navy.
F'resident Wilson will leave Wash!
inKton tomorrow ni^ht for New York

the Railway Business Association,
lie is also to talk before the Motion

COSIOF ARMOR PLATES^
EXPLAINED BY EXPERTS
Details of Manufacture Given by
William P. Barba and
Alva C. Dinkey.
A story of the great masses of material
handled by the armor maker and
the magnitude of the apparatus used in
shaping it into plates for battleships
was related today to the Senate naval |
committee by William 1*. Barba, once
laboratory boy in a steel plant and
now vice president of the Mid vale
Steel and Ordnance Company. He was i
seeking to convince the committee that
it was inadvisable for the government
to launch into making armor at a government
plant. Scores of photographs
of the plant were presented and a de- J
scription given of the care and judgment
necessarv to make armor.
Secretary Daniels and Rear Admiral
Strauss of the Xavv Department sat
by listening. Alva C. Dinkey, the new
president of the Midvale since its reorganization
last September, testified
as to operation of an armor plate plant.
Gives Detailed Report.
Holding in'his hands a detailed report .
by a chartered New York public accountant
on the actual cost of the Midvale
company producing the armor for
the Pennsylvania battleship. Mr.
Dinkey testified that it showed the "actual
factory cost of the armor made" '
was $341.36 a .ton, not including any j1
overhead charges. The government i <
pays $425 a ton. |
Mr. Dinkey first told the committee i ,
that he desired to testify that the Till- j
man report in 1914. placing cost of pro- i
auction ai WW a ion, w iis a iau engineer's
estimate, and then wished to
Kive the committee members the accountant's
report as to actual factory
cost, with the understanding: it would j <
not be printed in the hearings. Sena- i (
tor Swanson protested against receiv- |
ing any figures that could not be made j
public, and Senator Poindexter wanted I
to close the hearings at once. j ,
Many Anxious to Get Figures.
"We would not understand the details j
if you gave them to us," said Senator i
Swanson.
"I know you would not. but some
others have been anxious for years to j t
get them," responded the witness.
Then it was the witness consented to J ^
give the figure as to actual cost, minus ;
detailed description of arriving thereat. ^
At the same time he ofTered to' let the |
Secretary of the Navy inspect the com- \
plete report. f
Mr. Dinkey testified that his company i
could produce armor for $317 a ton by
working full capacity. Senator Lewis
suggested that the government might T
well give all its contracts to one com- ,
pany. that It might work full ca- i
pacity instead of dividing it among ,
t hree.
The hearing will he resumed later today.

SAY NOMINATION
DEPENDS ON IP
Politicians Think President's
Tour of Country of Vital
Importance.
BELIEVE COOL RECEPTION
WILL END HIS ASPIRATION
Declare Chief Executive Is Practical
ly "Going Before the Country"
on Preparedness.
Politicians at tlic Capitol, democrats
and republicans alike, are
interested in President W ilson's
forthcoming "swing around the
circle." As they view it. this will
be an epochal trip in his political
career. They are of the opinion
that the result of his effort
to arouse public support for his
preparedness program will have
important bearing upon his renomination
for the presidency.
In short, they sav, lie is practically
"going before the country."
to borrow a British political expression.
and if it should fall out
that he is not sustained in his at)
peal, he may find occasion to \ iew
the one-term plank in the Haitimore
platform as something more
than a declared principle.
Result Will Take Time.
It will be some weeks before the effects
of his appeal can be properly
analyzed, it is said. No one doubts
that he will receive an enthusiastic
reception in every city where he may
speak. The presence of the President
of the United States and his discussion
of a subject upon which men are divided
will guarantee large audiences
and enthusiasm. It is after he has
gone and the people are milling over
his arguments thai the effects can he
gauged, it is said, and measured by expressions
of opinion publicly and in the
press.
President AVilson has caused to he
made known that h* does not want to
appeal to democrats alone: he desires
the managers of the meetings to invite
republicans as well as democrats, as
he is dealing with a national and not
a partisn issue.
Say Politics Must Enter.
However, so the politicins declare,
partisan questions must necessarily
and to. a high degree enter into the
undertaking, since it will be demo
n miiv au i ?- i na i nr arena pi iiiicii ii> .
though republican reinforcement will
be gladly welcomed.
His trip is considered by politicians
to be well timed, as it will closely antedate
the holding of primaries for the
selection of delegates to the democratic
national convention ami the calling of
conventions for that purpose in nonprimary
states. It is a good opportunity
to "let the people look him
over," it is said. In this connection
they recall that in his letter to A.
Mitchell Palmer, on the one-term plank,
he declared that his course toward a
second-term candidacy would be determined
by the attitude of tlie people
toward him. in oilier words, if they
want him for President again, the
plank would be construed as a principle,
and if they do not want him, it
w ould be accepted as a policy.

There is no evidence of any
change in the policy concerning

Bill Will Carry Changes.
lr is now more than ever certain that
, the bill will carry certain proposed
legislative changes, by which the Presi:
dent will relinquish the appointing of
the register of wills, the recorder of
, deeds, the board of children's guardians.
the board of charities. It is prob'
able that the I*i 11 will also take from
i the Attorney General the duty of appointing
trustees for the Industrial
Home School for Colored Girls,
i The appropriation bill is dependent
i to some extent on what comes from the
District committee in the shape of a
| bill to conform to the ideas of the joint
select fiscal committee which recommended
a change in the relations bajtween
the I'nited States and the Disj
trict of Columbia. The House has heard
;that Chairman Johnson will introduce a
bill carrying out those ideas, with an

The Taxation System. '

a bill on the lines of the com:
mittee's report, and there are already
j bills on the Distric t committee calendar
from Representative Bailey of
{ Pennsylvania involving the taxation
I system.
! Looking over this general probability
! of long discussions in the District
committee, and the possibility of no
quick report on any of these bills, the
I Rage subcommittee will go ahead as it
I planned, and report a bill when ihe
'opportune moment comes carrying a
| proviso that will meet the general situ
report; that is. that the District
! revenues shall he covered into a trust
fund, that the Onited States shall assume
responsibility for the District and
that the District revenues shall he used

I Page sub-committee will ask for a special
rule to allow certajn needed paragraphs
of legislation to ride through
