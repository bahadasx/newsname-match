EXPEDITE
HEARING
OF RATE
• By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON, I). Oh Jan.
ii.l.—The influence of Jud
son C. Clements, a veteran
and much-res|iected member
of the interstate commerce
commission, will be used to
its utmost to secure an early
hearing on the application
of the public service commis
sion of the state of Washing
ton, which seeks to correct
the unfair discrimination in
passenger railroad rales ,
against Tacoma and other
points In the Northwest.
Part of the flies in the case is
a letter from C. A. Reynolds,
chairman of the public service
commission, of Wellington, to
Judge Clements, asking that the
case be expedited, so that the
Northwest, may have the benefit
%f any rate corecllon which may j
be made during next summer's
tourist season.
Will Hxpedlte Caae.
Judge Clements has said he
will do what he can, and the feel-!
ing about the Interstate com-!
merce commission is that the case
will be expedited.
According to the regular prac
tice of the commission, the re
spondent railroads would have
until February 7 to file their re
ply, which Is still unfiled.
This might bring the hearing
In March, unless it were put it
the end of a long calendar, and
the decision might be expected by
April or May, ln time for the
spring and summer tourist sea
son.
Make Rate Complaint.
The petition sets forth that the
railroads have made a rate from
Chicago through the Southern
and Central routes, New Orleans,
etc., to San Francisco and return,
which is $21.7 5 less In the regu
lar season than the route through j
Tacoma and Seattle, via St. Paul,
back to Chicago, and which is I
$17.50 less than the summer rate j
by the same routes, though the
Journey by the Northern lines Is
aproxlmately 253 miles shorter
than the distance to San Fran
cisco by tbe Southern line.
The petition sets forth,
also, that there are many
places of Interest to tourists
along the Northern line, par
ticularly in the state of
Washington, where large
sums of money have been ex
pended by the state in the
construction of highways
and the improvement of state
reserves to make points of
interest accessible to tour
ists.

When They Fall Back Dead!
BY ROBERT MINOR
Famous Cartoonist and Correspondent.
I don't want the editor of The Times to give
the impression that I actually saw this scene.
There are enough correspondents claiming to
have seen what they have merely heard de
scribed by soldiers.
CORRESPONDENTS DON'T SEE SUCH
THINGS. The authorities take pains to have
them come to the trenches only when there is
no chance of such activity.
The above picture of the inception of a bay- .
onet charge was drawn from a description by
a lieutenant of the French army.
"You fellows have a wrong idea of a bay
onet charge," he told me. "There is none of
the heroic in it that you print in the papers.
None of that wild exultation —just a sick feel
ing takes its place.
"You don't understand that, because you
imagine the surroundings to be so different
from what they are. We just stamp around in
the mud and cold for a long time, and then we
throw bombs, maybe, or dodge bombs. The
- order comes to the officers to get the men out
to charge.
Public Is Going to Win This Fight
We're going to win this
fight.
Tacoma and her sister cit
ies ln the northwest are go
ing to win back that IM) per
cent of western tourist travel
of which they have lieen
i-ohbed by the unfair rates
which Hie southern lines have
hoou allowed to exact.
While public opinion, in the
shape of red-blooded business men
and commercial organizations,
baa been awakened to Its full
force to get fair treatment for
the northwest, the fight is being
carried today to tho door of the
national capital at Washington.
Ollboii Gardner reports that
Judson C. Clements, member ot
the Interstate commerce commis
sion, Is using his influence to
get an early hearing of the north
west's complaint before the sum
mer tourist travel begins.
At tlie same time conies tho
news that Senator Mils*
Polndexter will introduce a
bill to congress to have tho
interstate commerce commis
sion put back Into efficient
working order where It be
longs.
The public service commission

According to Chairman Charles
A. Reynolds, wh-. was ln Tacoma
yesterday, the word "advantage"
ln the Interstate commerce law,
hag been so construed! and mis
construed and jumbled that it
doesn't mean anything much.
Senator Polndextor Intends to
see to it that the law Is made to
mean something and that tho way
Is paved for putting the kibosh
on the "advantage" which the
Southern Pacific and Its allied
lines have been exerting against
Tacoma.

Health Officer Wall
Blames Cafeteria As
Source of Disease—
Assistant Principal
Among the Stricken
A scare of typhoid
fever at Si: m HlKh
school, which already has re
sulted In nine severe cases,
including that of Assistant
Principal __, K. Perkins, Is
being Investigated this week
by Health Officer Wall and
Ills deputies.
That the disease has been
spread iii the restaurant of
the school has lieen deter
mined almost definitely, he
says.
He has oidered a string*!
examination of the restau
rant and all peisim*. con
nected with 11. It is possible
that everyone employed In
the school cafaterla will be
subjected to a typlniid ami
toxin.
Assistant Principal Perkins be
came 111 a month ago, and was
removed to Tacoma (ieneral hos
pital a few days later. Shortly
afterwards two pupils, a hoy and
girl who had been attending
dances) together, became serious
ly 111 with typhoid and were also
taken to hospitals.
Health officers made an Inves
tigation of the three cases and
were perplexed over the origin of
the disease. Water sum pies were
taken In all parts of the city, but
no trace of the typhus germ was
found.
Trace Trouble to Cafeteria.
Within a few days other stu
dents of the Stadium High became
111 with typhoid. For six days
there was a new case reported
daily. With nine cases of the
same disease, all from persons at
tending tile same school, Health
Officer Wall's suspicions were
aroused and he ordered a general
investigation.
Water from every faucet in
tiie Bchool was tested, with nega
tive resultß. Then the health de
partment discovered that every
person afflicted with the disease
had been patronizing the school's
cafaterla*
Working like a corps of detec
tives. Dr. Wall's officers probed
the restaurant system at the
school.
One a "Carrier."
It was found that 20 persons
were employed serving food dur
ing the noon hour. Of this num
lier eight were employed by the
cafeteria and the remainder were
students. Half of the 20- had
been ill with typhoid at some time
or other in their lives.
Any person who has had ty
phoid may continue to act as a
carrier of typhus bacclli Indefi
nitely after he has apparently
been cured ot the disease, accord
ing to Dr. Wall, and it is the be
lief of the health department that
one of the employes of the Sta
dium High school cafeteria is act
ing as a "typhoid carrier."
None for Two Days.
As proof of this theory, Dr.
Wall cites the case of "Typhoid
Mary" of New York, who spread
the disease to hundreds of per
sons unconsciously, while she was
not herself ill with disease.
Basing his work on this theory,
Dr. Wall has given a temporary
order demanding utmost care and,
cleanliness among the 20 em
ployes of the school cafaterla.
Unless the individual who is
caring the disease Is discovered,
