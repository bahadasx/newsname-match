MRS. SAMUEL G. BUCKNER
Buried With Her Loyed Ones
Last Friday Morning-
Mrs. Kate Wooldridge Buckner,
widow of the late Councilman Samuel
G. Buckner, peacefully sank to rest
Thursday morning, after a long illness
complicated with a stroke of paralysis
last November. She was 79 years
old and was born in Trigg county, a
daughter of Dr. T. M. Wooldridge,
one of the leading physicinns of his
day. In early HfttBhe Was married
to Mr. Buckner and soon afterwards
he moved to Hopkinsville and with
hor brother, Jos. C Wooldridge, en
gaged in the tobacco warehouse busi
ness. For 50 years Mr. Buckner was
identified with the tobacco trade until
his death two years ago. Their union
was blessed with Jive sons and one
daughter, Mrs. Mattie Owsley, with
whom Mrs. Buckner made her home.
Two of the sons, the oldest and
youngest, survive. These are Thos.
W. Buckner, of Henderson, and
Robt. H. Buckner, of this city. Frank
W., Joseph C. and Sherwood Buck
ner have all died in the last few years.
A grandson, Gordon Buckner, lives
on the Pacific coast.
Mrs. Buckner was a lifelong mem
ber of the Baptist church and was a
devoted and consecrated christian
under all circumstances. Trouble
come to her in many forms, but nev-
er for an instant did her sublime faith
in God waver, but she accented' her
burden of grief with a patient resig
nation beautiful to behold. She loved
her church and was a leader for all of
its good works. In the temperance
work she was a leader in all the
churches, for years-holding the posi
tion of president of the load W. C. T.
U. It is the universal testimony of
those who knew her best, that no
woman ever lived and died in Hop
kinsville whose daily life was a more
shining example of christian love and
faith. The good she did will live after
her. She has entered into a reward
prepared for the righteous.
The funeral services were held at
the First Baptist church Friday by Rev.
C. M. Thompson and her body was
laid to rest in Riverside Cemetery.
