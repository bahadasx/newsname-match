"This action is without precedent
in American history, and the nation,
in thus evidencing! its sympathy for
our brethren, and urging all to join
for the relief of the Jews in the war
zones, has set Jews of America an
example which they dare not ignore.
"Let it not be said of a single Jew
in the land that he Is less interesteJ

Christian brethren. Let January 27
be solemnized and made a day for con

CAREER OF
COCOS KING
IS CLOSED
Ruler of Original Comic Opera Realm
Passes Awiy in Land of Palms in
South Seas After Reign of
Many Years
SUPREME SWAY OVER
TWENTY ISLANDS
Roving Scotchman Becomes Star Actor in
Romance of Real Life; Triumphs
Over Rival and Reigns as
Absolute Monarch
By WILBUR S. FORREST,
(United. Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Jan. 8. (By Mail.) The
news that King Ross of the Cocos Is
lands has laid him down in the shade
of the palms and died was cabled here
today. The brief message rings down
the curtain vyon the last act of the
first ruler of the real, original comic
opera kingdom The Land of Cocos
which Hes upon the shimmering silver
lap of the South seas, a diminutive
emerald world in a setting of pink
coral reefs. Andy Ross was a Scotch
adventurer who, after a roving youth,
discovered and decided to cast his lot
as king with the motly inhabitants
of the little story hook kingdom
From IS27 until his death he wag the
oddest king, with the queerest sub
jects and the most extraordinary do
main in all the world. His was a
kingdom where the arrival of Sinhad
the Sailor, Alice in Wonderland, Gul
liver and the Boy Who Could .Not
Learn to Shiver and Shakes would not
have seemed unusual His was a
kingdom that put romance into real
life and real life Jnto "omance. The
Cocos islands !s distinctly an O.
Henry land, a place such as Gilbert
& Sullivan saw only in fancy, a spot
that Robert Louis Stevenson would be
loth to leave.
Ross was king, court, government
and owner of this group of Indian
ocean islands, twenty in all, - whose
only excitement in history occurred
during the present war the destruc
tion of the German cruiser Emden by
the Australian battleship Sydney, off
the Cocos' coast.
King Ross was the third of his line.
In 1823, an English adventurer nam
ed Alexander Hare settled in the is!
ands with a number of slaves given
him by an Indian potentate. Two
years later Ross, a Scotchman redis
covered tho islands and determined to
colonize them. He returned in 1827
with a party of Scotch and found Hare
in possession. The two factions set
tled by dividing the islands equally.
Finally, however, the natives swore
allegiance to Ross and he and his
descendants have ruled their story
book kingdom ever since.
Interspersed with palms covered
atolls and flanked by reefs of pink
coral, the picturesque little group of
silands is more like a scere from a
musical comedy than anything else.
In 1S3B the British government ex
tended protection to the Cocos. I
1SS5 parliament sent a commisison to
investigate conditions there. When
the British warship with the commis
sion on board steamed into the lagoon
at Direction island, the inhabitants
and the king and his court welcomed
them just like a comic opera South
sea island king would be expected to
do.
The palace was thrown open to the
Europeans; and the royal family, its
salaaming Malay servants and their
oil was at the disposal of the men from
civilization. '
All the people of the island group
are of more than ordinarily powerfu
physique, muscular and l!th?; quite
Jack Londonish, in fact. The brown
shinned natives spesk their own lan
guage with a Scottish burr. The
white royalty speaks the native tongue
too. Even the king himself knew lit
tle of the English tongue that his fore
fathers used. The chief industry Is
copra aad coral gathering. There is
jo metal money. The king decided
at first that money is tho root of ail
evil, so he issued cards an1 not too
many of them. Tha kingdom is ad
ministered on model lines. The kins
makes his own lawg, polices his do
main and provides everything for his
