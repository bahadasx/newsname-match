Rumor Says State Department
May Break Off Negotiations
With von Bernstorff and
Insist on Show-down. '
Germany's latest position in the
Lusitania controversy is unsatis
factory to the American Govern
ment. Out of a chaos of conflicting
statements emanating from the
State Department and German em
bassy quarters, this fact stands out
jif representing the views of the
Administration with respect to the
latest communication from Berlin.
' Refusing even to admit that
such a communication has been
received, Administration officials
arc highly incensed over the an
nouncement this morning that the
controversy has been virtually
settled. There is suspicion in
Government circles that friends of
the German ambussador, anxious
for art early settlement, have
assumed to declare that the new
communication, represents entirely
the views o fthe United States. '

More Danger of War
With Britain Than With
Germany, Says Mann
Minority Leader in House Speech Suggests Wisdom
of Preparing Thoroughly Now For Future.
Declares Present Conflict Will Nbt
End Strife Between Nations.
There is more danger of a war with England than with Ger
many, Republican Leader Mann today declared in a ringing speech
m the House announcing he would support preparedness legislation.
He' urged immediate creation of a standing army of from 250,000
to a half-million men.
"I have much m&rc fear of a war with England then I have
bf waf with Germany,' ' he declared.
Regarding preparedness details, Mann said:
"It were well as an emergency? we should increase the regular
army to 250,000, 300,000 or even a haLf-million; we should provide
ample coast fortifications and a navy able to defend us on the seas."
APPLAUSE FROM BOTH SIDES OF HOUSE.
Loud applauso was given Mann, from
both Democrats and Republicans, nearly
all leaders of both parties being pres
ent to hear his speech. The Republican
leader urged non-partisan consideration
of the question and support of the Aa
minlstratlon. "It Is well known that I havo never
been In favor of a large standing nrmj.
and I supposes I havo been properly
classed as a 'llttlo navy' man. ' said
Alnnn.

Defense Is Ready.
The defense Is ready. Attorneys Fitz

ing the Interim between the close of
court last Friday and the opening on
Monday. Fitzgerald, it Is announced,
will make the opening address for Mrs.
Mohr. He will then begin the Introduc
tion of witnesses and probably will not
give way to Lewis before the middle of
next week.
Lewis Is to handle the Joint case
of Cecil Victor Brown and Henry Spell
man, both as to presentation and tes
timony, while John B. Edwards, repre
senting Spellman alone, will act In an
advisory capacity. Fitzgerald Is uncer
tain when he will put Mrs. Mohr on
the stand, but that she will take the
witness stand nnd tell her own story of
her troubles with htr murdered hus
band. Dr. C. Franklin Mohr, ls con
sidered a foregone conclusion.
Three Weeks More.
A verdict within three weeks Is un
likely. Attorney Lewis believes:
Just what the defense plans to show
Is not clearly understood today. Attor
ney Lewis places much credence In the
story of an anonymous Informant who
approached him on the street In Boston
promising to give him Important in

In court "at tho proper time." He will

Acting Chief Engineer of De-

Officials of the Flro Department de
clared themselves today stronglv op
posed to the suggestion of the Washing
ton Rallvvr.v and Klectrlc Company that
all flro stops be abolished.
Acting Chief F.nglncer James Kcllher
said he believed the responsibility for
collisions between fire npmratus and
strict cars Miould not be put up te the
Fire Department, as would be th case
if the rollwav company's suggestion
ihould be approved by the Commis
sioners. Loss of time and added danger,
he said, would result.
"To Illustrate, take No. 4 truck house
at Now Jersev avenue and M street."
said Chief Kclihor. "In responding to
an alarm from the box at Twelfth and
M streets tho truck has to cross five
oir trnckp nt Xcvv Jernev avenue nnd
M. Fourth str'cot. Seventh street. Ninth
and nicventh street-.. To bo compelled
to slow down on nnproachlnsr each of

Would Increases Danger.
. "The clement of dancer would le
greatlv increased. Fire apparatus
should be given the c:c'uslve right of

the driver of th nnnaratus and the
motorman each :nnv be wllllnr to take
a chance, thinking the other fellow will
slow up. Under the present svstenl
there Is no miration as to who has the
right of way."
Tho records of the Flro Tlopurtment
show several fatal accidents rr-sultln.,
from collisions between flro apparatus
and street cars prior to the adortlon of
the regulations establishing tile slops.
On July 2. 1"W, No. 7 hose carriage

Income Tax law to Raiss
$100,000,000 Additional
Revenue Planned.
TO PUT BILL UP TO WILSON
By THEODORE TILLER.
An in9omc tax law that will
raise approximately $100,000,000
additional revenue most of it
wrung from the wealthier classes
is the Democratic answer to the
national defense problem.
Plans are under wav today at
the Capitol to amend tho incom'
tx law so that the long arms of
the taxing power shall extend deeo '
into the pockets of the rich and
delve gently into the purse of the
man of moderate salary. It is oni"
a question of time until an amend
ed income tax bill is presented11 at
the White House for the signature
of the President.
If there existed any doubt that
the income tax was destined to be
come the chief revenue producer
of the Adrninisjration at this period
.of monetary need, it was removed
by-the decisidriNof the Supreme
Cpurt which on yesterday upheld
the constitutionality of tho income
tax in its every phase.
