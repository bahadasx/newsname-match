The story of a wonderful accomp
ifihment for a little child has just
reached this city by letters from Mr.
and, Mrs. Jackson Mickle of Newark,
S.,D. Mr. Mickle Is the son of Mrs
N. J. Mickle, who resides on wrest
Third street, find lives on* a farm two
miles from Newark. The *even year
old daughter of the home has always
been fmd of horses and has been al
lowed to ride and be around the ani
mals a great deal. She is fearless
and dauntless about the farm and in
all ways a normal child.
Some time late this fall her fath
er waa away pon business in Nebras
ka leaving hi^^ife and child alone
upon the farm." One night a heavy
rain storm came up and shortly af
ter midnight, Mrs. Mickle became
violently ill, and knew that a phy
sician must be called. They have no
telephone ao little Margaret, the
daughter, made her way to the barn
where she put the saddle and bridle
upon the tioree to wihich she was ac
customed to ride. Then she started
en the two mije ride to Newark to
get the doctor, facing the wind and
rain. Twice upon the*way, the horse
became frightened and threw the
child off. Neither time was she hurt,
but both times she, got up and led- the
-animal to a fencepost from which she
climl^id to its back, her sight aided
by fiaflhesof lightning.

take her feat as aFmatter of course
and consider tt a thing which any

horses, might do. pot one child of

do the thing, however, and those who
have heard of the ark, consider it one

Many Would Lose.
Burlington Hawkeye: N.-J. tor
tus, who lives near Webster City, has
gone in for ginseng farming. He con
tracted for the disposal of his crop
recently at $900. There was 200
pounds of the stuff and it was grown
upon one acre of ground. No doubt
some of the town folk who read that
little item, will sit up and take no
tice, and then they will read up a
bit and conclude to go into ginseng
farming as a side line. Some years
ago, there ^vere many in every town
who believed that poultry would
prove a sure and quick road to
wealth. They read up a bit, went
in
and failed. It will be the same
'way with the amateur ginseng farm
er. And then, if very many went Into
jginseng farming, they would soon
push down the price to a feolnt where
tho crop Would cease to be profitable.
•But $900 an acre must sound rather
good to the farmer who has hereto
fore considered $50 excellent returns
from one acre.
In Serious Condition.
Anton Chrlstenson, who resides in
the northwest part of the city and is
ill with paralysis, has had a change
for the worse and his condition is
now considered serious. He had Ween
gettipg along nicely but lately sus
tained slight strokes, each one of
which loft him weaker. His sister,
Mrs. P. Hanson of Bancroft, Neb., the
only other one of his family, is at his
dside. Her daughter, Mrs. H.
rumwiede, who accompanied her
here, returned to her
4home

FIRST TRAIN INTO
WEBSTER CITY
Iron Horse Crossed the Boone River
on its Initial Trip, April
6, 1869.
A few days.ago the Freeman-Trib
une came across an old copy of the
Ditbuflue Herald of April 13, 1869,
and found the following article cred
ited to the Webster City Freeman of
April 7 of that year:
Yesterday fo-finuon the first rail
road train crossed the Boone river.
The train left Iowa Flails on Monday
mortaing, and by dint of hard work
reached trawler fater ln the after
noori. Here the men were fed and
taken care of by Mr. Tinling. In the
morning they resumed operations,
and at about ten o'clock crossed the
new bridge at this place. In company
with several of our citizens we went
over on the east side to see the "ele
phant" make his "second advent."
Arriving at the bridge, the train
stopped, and by invitation of engin
eer Sherman, and contractor Wilson,
the party got aboard, and had the
honor of making the trial trip across
the bridge. The train, which com
prised the engine, three platform and
one freight car, passed over. the
bridge without the least perceptible
vibration of tho structure, and ar
rived safely within the limits of Web
ster City. ,.
Yes, the good time coming—has
come, and Webster City is a real rail
road town. Hurrah for we'uns!

A CAR TO COMPETE

Gigantic Business Struggle Against
Pea^ Advocate to be
Launched.
NewS is sentf out from Detroit,
Michigan, to the effect that Henry
Ford and Walter C. Durant will be
the principals in a gigantic business
struggle, and before their battle is
finished it is estimated that millions
of dollars will be expended in com
petition. .!
The lines of the first 6kirmisiifare
just being formed, but when the
battle is on In earnest fts limits" Will
reach the national capital, and will
become international in scope.
The two men hold exactly opposite
views on international affairs. Ford
opposes all plans of war, while the
Dupont Powder interests are said to
be behind Durant to monopolize the
trade in munitions supplies.
It is asserted that Durant is about
to place upon the market a car that
will compete with the Ford, to te\
produced by the General Motors or
ganization, and that James Couzens,
who recently left the Ford company,
will be chief director of the new or
ganization.
Ford is said to be maintaining a
lobby of newspaper men at Washing

paredness program, and it is alleged
that these agents are meeting oppo
sition at every point from Durant's
agents.
THINK WOODS WILL
BEJiE-ElECTED
His Friends at Washington Believe
Tenth District Congressman
a Winner.
Washington, Jan. 24.—Although
the fight against Representative
Frank P. Woods for re-election as
chairman of the republican congres
sional committee has not ended the
situation has shaped up sufficiently
to warrant the belief the efforts to
defeat him will not succeed. Some
days ago his opponents claimed
enough votes to bdat him, but his
friends have been busy since then
and think they have turned tho ta
bles.
Republican House Leader Mann
is for the re-election of Mr. Woods
and this has weight. Opponents of
Mr. Woods made an attempt to cen
ter on Representative Nick l^ong
worth of Ohio, but did not succeed.
It looked at one time as if former
Chairman McKinley of Illinois would
bo elected but the probabilities of
this have lately grown less.

was worse and under the care of a
physician and two trained nurses.
Mr. and Mrs. Shipp are now in New
Orleans, having reached that city on
their way to Florida and other points
south. Mrs. Wilson at once sent a
message of inquiry to her father,
asking if she should not come to
New Orleans at once and he replied
that it would not be necessary for
his daughter to come. Mrs. Wilson
also sent a dispatch to Mrs. Minnie
Willson of this city, Mrs. Shipp's
sister, who is now in Los Angeles,
California. Mrs. Willson was heard
from this morning, inquiridg wheth
er she should return home or go to
New Orleans, and it is presumed
that upon hearing from here again
that she left Los Angeles for the
southern city.
The daughter received .another
message today, saying her mother

Local High School Basket Ball Tepj
Opens Home Season With
Decisive Victory.
Before a small but enthusiastic^
crowd in the new high school courts
over the Mercantile store, the Web- 1
ster City high school basket ball
team Saturday evening trimmed the
fast Pomeroy team by tho score of :.
41 to 19. Previoue dope pointed to•=.
a decisive defeat of tho local quin
tette, but from the very first of the:
game Webster City spurted to thoi
front and was never threatened*'
throughput the rest of the contest.*
The visiting team, however, showed
plainly the effects of the heavy gamej^
they had played the night before at?
Fonda, and considering these condi
tions, they put up a plucky and des^:'
perate fight at all times.
The Webster City team won the *v
game through their consistent team .'
work. There was no individual star. .V-'s*
Repeatedly throughout the
contest they took tho ball frojn un-
der the Pomeroy goal and bx con
sistent passing advanced it toward
the Webster City basket. The ... fr,
throwing of baskets was evenly di- ii jWJ
vi am a of a ad
while Johnson of Pomeroy threw HjT
four baskets.
This makes the third consecutive
game won by the local team, which
fact would warrant a much larger
crowd than was present Saturday

game will be played with the Ells
