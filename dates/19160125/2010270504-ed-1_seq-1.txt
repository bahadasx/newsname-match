Why There's a Time Limit
You've seen the kind of
sale that goes on and on.
without any limit, as long
as there seems to be any
interest in it. Sometimes
it looks as if the merchant
kept on buying stock for
the express purpose of con
tinuing his sale.
But this isn't that kind of
a sale. We set a definite
time in which to sell cer
tain goods. When that
time is up the sale is over.
If there should be anything
left it goes right back in
sLock at the regular price.
But it doesn't look as if
much would be left, judg
ing by the last few clays.
People appreciate value,
and they're getting it here.

tunity? Plenty of time till
