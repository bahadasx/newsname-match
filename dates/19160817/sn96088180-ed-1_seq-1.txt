Republican Nominee Scores Underwood Tariff and Admin

Branded Artificial Due to European War Conditions
tGreeted Here By Cheers of Throng, Cannon and Band
"We can't build an American pros
perity on the Underwood tariff. We
.must be able to live without a Euror
jtean war," marked a point In the talk
of Governor Hughes at which the can
didate for the presidency was forced
to wait for the applauie and cheering
jto aubilde.
" U we are to have a prosperity that
da a real American prosperity It must
e based upon a sound principle of
.protection, the Republican tariff,"
A continued. "We must look to the
maintenance of American wagea after
.the war. The artificial prosperity of

The Underwood tariff was passed

not reduce the cost of living, but It
.did put a good many men out of the
way of making a living. What 1 mean
by "a dominant Americanism" la that
eve must be able to live by ourselves
and depend on ourselves. That's
what I stand for and what the Repub
' llcau parly represents.
"We must avoid the Ill-will of for
eign countries and avoid conflict, but
Above all we must respect ourselves
.and make them respect us. We must
be able to make them know we mean
what we say, so that they will re

We all want peace, but It must be
peace with honor. That ia what Am

"We're having a good time going
through Oregon," he concluded, "and
deeply appreciate the attention we re
ceive," Indicating that be meant "we"

Berlin, Aug. 17. AN v!erous at

made today by the Berlin Mo'gt-npost

alleged to have displayed in a con
fidential communication to the atate

American correspondent In Berlin
recently handed to Gerard a protest
against British censorship, of cable
despatches and mall matter they had
sent to the United States. They
pointed out that the (British censor
badly mutilate many of their dis
patches and that a large pervntagrt
of their mall stories failed to rtach
America at all. - .;!.-
In transmitting the report to the
states department, Gerard is report
ed to have tent along a confidential
aote, recommending that no action be
taken by the American government
unless Germany removed the censor-
ship on news sent to America. -How
this alleged confidential note became

Progress in West-Russia
Claims No Gaia For the
First Time ia Fortnight
London, Aug." 17. Strong Austro-j
Grman counter-attacka have halted
the Russian and Italian . offensive,
the great battle of the Somme con
tinues to progress slowly' but favor
ably to the allies.
For the first time in more than a
fortnight, the official statement from
the Russian war office today recorded
no gains. Petrogrsd dispatches car
ried the admission that enemy counter-attacks
have checked General Bru
siloff'a armies. The German war of
fice reported not only the repulse of
all Slav, attacks, but the capture of
a dominating height in, the eastern
Carpathians.. v. . -t-v
The arrival of Austrian reinforce
en Is and the necessity at straighten
lng out the Italian front have halted
General Cadorna's arch southward
against Trieste. Official despatchea
war office regarding the outcomee of
severe fighting on the Somme front
yesterday and last night, contained
sharp contradictions. The Germans
admitted the loss of 500 yards of first
line trenches to the French south of
the Somme, but announced that both
the British and French were driven
out of trenches they penetrated north
of the river.
General Halg, in hla first report on
yesterday's fighting on the Somme
front, announced the capture not only
of positions aroundGuillemont, of
ficially reported from Paris last night,
but also the taking of 300 yards of
German trenches. The French war
office reported violent artillery strug
gles on the Somme front last night,
but said the Germans made no at
tempt to re-conquer positions cap
tured by the allies yesterday. .
Similar Contradictions are contain
ed in official reports regarding recent
operations In the Balkans. A delay
ed Bulgarian official statement today
claimed the repulsed of strong French
attacks extending along a wide front,
while the French war office announc
ed successes In a number of local operations.

Paris, Aug. 17. Beaten back by
the heavy French assault on both
banks of the Somme, the Germans
made no attempt to counter-attack
against the newly conquered French
positions laHt night. An officii! state
ment from the war office reported
today a lull in Infantry fight
ing on the Somme front, but report
ed violent artillerying, especially
near Maurepas and Belloy-en-San
Terre, where the French advanced
yesterday.
London, Aug. 17. Driving " for
ward In conjunction with the French,
the British not only scored advances
west and southwest of Gulllemont
mont last night, lut also captured
300 yards of a German trench west
of the Foureaux wood, General Haig
reported this afternoon. The gain
in this region advanced the British
front S00 yards from their previous
positon. East of Mouquette farm,
northwest of Poxleres machine ns
stopped a German attack.
Petrograd, Aug. 17. The capture
of 7,506 more prisoners by the Rus
sian armies under General Sakhar-
