Represented at Conference.
Physicians representing tho health
departments of thirty-eight Htates. a
dozen railroads and scores of cities,
who assembled at the Publlu Health
Service headquarters here today to dis
cuss methods of combating Infantile
paralysis heard Dr. Haven Emerson,
health commissioner of New York
city, discuss the epidemic, which has
gripped the metropolis for six weeks.
Dr. Emerson's report was the feat
ure of the initial session of tho con

demic, primarily, which caused tho
conference.
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo

of the problem. . ,

upon some standaid methods by which
the conduct of persons in quarantined

NEW SCHOOLS
Failure of Congress to Pass D.
C. Bill Will Prevent Opening
of Term.
MEANS DELAY OF YEAR
All Improvements Except Those
Already Authorized Would
Be Held Up. .
Should Congress fail to pass the
District appropriation bill the new
$1,200,000 Central High School
and the new $500,00 colored high
school, the Dunbar, will not be
opened during the coming school
term, unless their maintenance is
provided for by special legislation,
according to statements of District
government and school officials to
day. ' -,- " - f
The Senate appropriation bill
provides for the Central High
School an appropriation of $19,760
for janitors, engineers electricians,
firemen, coal passers, watchman,
charwomen and laborers, a total of
twenty-nine employes.
The amount appropriated for em
ployes of the Dunbar School is
$10,700.
EMPLOYES NEEDED.
Under the continuing resolution no
money is provided ror these employes
and It would be Impossible, It was said
by school officials, to obtain from other
school buildings a sufficient force of
skilled workmen to operate tho build
ings.
Delay in passage of the bill, accord
ing to officials of the engineer depart
ment, Is seriously hampering department
contracts for street and other Improve
ments. Contracts cannot be awarded
until the amount of money that will be
available Is known. Work on Improve
ment of suburban roads and resurfacing
of city streets, which under ordinary
conditions would havo been well under
way, may be delayed until next sprlnr.
The work Is usually begun about July
1, and much of It accomplished before I
December IB, when if weather condi
tions compel It there Is a cessuUon un
til March.
Other Disadvantages Faced.
If the District hill should fall a num
ber of additional disadvantages would
result because of the Inability to carry
out Improvements proposed in tho new
bill.
Thp District would lack:
Authorization for extension and pave
ment of new streets and suburban
roads.
New apparatus for the Fire Depart
ment, amounting to nearly JlOO.OOo.
An apptoprlatlon for a municipal hos
pital. increases of salaries proposed for
vnrloim employes of the District gov
ernment. Police nnd firemen's pension legisla
tion. The continuation nf the old appropri
ations would amount to merely the con
tinued payment of salaries authorized
by existing law and contributions to
ward projects authorized In the bill of
a year ago. No new legislation vhnt
ever, would result through a resolu
tion continuing old approw'lons, und
so far as civic Improvement is con
cerned tho District would remain where
It wan one year ago.

RAILWAY PRESIDENTS
CALLED TO WHITE
HOUSE CONFERENCE
Chief Executive Ready to Take Labor Crisis
to Ultimate Sufferer-America's Hundred
Million People-As Last Court of Resort.
NEW YORK, Aug. 17 A dozen president, of big
railway jrttems will leave here at 4 o'clock for Wash
ington in response to President Wilson's telejraro, asking
them to the White House to discuss the controversy with
their employes.
Determined to leave no stone unturned in his effort to
bring about an agreement between the railroads and their
employes that will prevent a strike, President Wilson is un
derstood to be prepared, if necessary, to summon to Wash
ington the men of Wall Street who own the roads.
Already he has summoned the presidents of the roads
and the main committee of brotherhood chairmen.
His purpose is to get his appeal before the "ultimate
authorities" on both sides. If the railroad presidents back
up the managers' committee in their unyielding attitude,
it is not improbable that men like J. P. Morgan and mem
bers of the railroad.-banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., will
be made to feel the force of the President's demand.
Beyond this the President is said to feel that he has a
still stronger influence to which he might appeal the in
fluence of the 100,00Q,000 people of the country, whose
welfare, he has already told both sides, is intimately bound
up with the threatened strike.
ADMIT SITUATION IS GRAVE.
No one. not even in official circles, attemntari tortav in
conceal the fact that the outloo
l ne managers are adamant at present in their determi
nation not to accept the eight-hour basic day, unless the
whol ematter is first submitted to arbitration. The em
ployes are equally determined that there should be no arbi
tration. And President Wilson has apparently sided with the
employes.
From the standpoint of the managers, it is a question
of suicide or murder, as far as the yare concerned- suicide
if they agree to the proposals o fthe President, and murder if
it is forced upon them.
While they have not gone so far as to say that they
will accept a strike rather than the plan proposed, their at
titude is extremely belligerent.
Responses from the railroad presidents indicate that
all those invited cannot get here before noon tomorrow, at
which time the final stage in the crisis may be set
ACCEPTANCES ALREADY RECEIVED.
Thus far acceptances of tho Invlta
tlons have been receivqd from Vice
President Atterbury, of the Pennsyl
vania, who will come In place of Presl
dent Bea, the latter being on the Pa
cific coast; William H. Trucsdale, presi
dent of the Lackawanna; Daniel Wll
lurd, president of tho Baltimore and
Ohio: P. D. Underwood, president of
the Erie: Howard Elliott, president of
the New Havtn; A. II. Smith, president
of the New York Central; Hale Holden,
presldtnt of the Chicago, Burlington,
and Qulncy: H. F. Bush, receiver of the
Missouri Pacific, and R. H. Alahton, of
the Chicago and Northwestern.
The name of J. H. HusUs, president
of the Boston and Maine, lias been
added o the list of those Invited.
In the meantime the President Is for
tifying himself with complete data con
cerning tho effect of an acsllcotlon of
tht elgh-hour day on he railroads.
Judge William L. Chambers, of the
Federal board of mediation and con
ciliation, who has been collecting this
material through experts, had anothtr
long conference with the President to
day, a few hours before the 8(0 railroad
brotherhood chairmen were to assemble
In the East Room for a conference with
the Chief Executive.
Following Is the telegram sent to the
railroad presidents last nlffht:
Discussion of the matters Involved
In the threatened railway strike has
reached a point which makes It high
ly desirable that I should personally
confer with vou at the earliest pos
sible moment, and with the presi
dents of any of the railways affrctod
wftot mav be fmmedlable accessible,
Hon vou can moke It convenient to
come 'to Washington at once.
WOODROW WILSON.
This morning the President talked
over the long distance telephone with
Daniel Wlllnrd. president of the Balti
more and Ohio railroad who Informed
him that a delegation of railroad presi
dents would come to Washington with

In this thev strongly indicated thev
would not concede the eight-hour
prlcplle, even for tho proposed trial
period, nnd that the strongest con
cession thev would make would be
to submit the whole matter to arbi
tration, the President to name tho
arbitrators.
8he action of the President lllus-
trates with dramatic effect the in
tensely critical stage which has been
reached n the negotiations.
Having already summoned the en
tire committee of 640 brotherhood
?,hS rm,n t0 confer with him .at th
White House at 3 o'clock this after
noon, the President Iioh found It
tiecesasrv to appeal to the suprffmo
heads of the railroads.
The railway presidents to whom
the President addressed hi smessage
are:
Daniel Wlllard, Baltimore and Ohio:
Samuel Rea, Pennsylvania: A. H. Smith!
New Tork Central; F. D. Underwood.

Oreat Western; Fairfax Harrison.
Southern Railway; E. C. Ripley: Santa
Fe.: R. II. Alshton, Chicago and North
western, and A. J, Earllng, St. Paul.
Every Indication promises a climax to
day In the efforts of the President to
prevent a walk-out of the railroad em
ployes, Overnight he prepared In definite terms
a final proposition, which he will lay be
fore the managers and the brotherhoods.
Upon the acceptance or rejection of this
proposal probably depends whether a
complete paralysis Is to tie up the trans
portation lines of the United States.
The President Is prepared to use the
"big stick" with dramatic force, al
though It is the railroad managers that
are likely to feel the heaviest blows.
