'JEALOUS MAN SLAYS COUPLE AND ESCAPES
COMMON LAW WIFE
AND AFFINITY SHOT
AFTER MOVIE SHOW
Detectives were searching the woods
near the university Thursday for Frank
Young, alias Frank Von de Hyda, of the
Rector hotel, who shot and killed Miss Mar
tini Antone, his common law wife, and Jack
Collinson, both of Vancouver, B. C., in a
jealous rage near Providence hospital at 9
p. m. Tuesday.
When Dr. 1. H. Moore, Young's physi
cian, and a Rector hotel clerk, with whom
the slayer visited for two hours following the
shooting, insisted they didn't think he was
the kind of a man to kill himself, police sent
a bulletin description of him all over the
state.
But they kept up the hunt for him near
the university, where the clerk said Young
said he was going, in the hope of finding
that he had killed himself.
The woman died at Providence hospital
at 4:20 a. m. Thursday, but Collinson, who
posed, as her husband, police say. with three
- bullet* in his back, died a few minutes after
Efr was) taken from the street.
Young, known as Frank Von de Hyda
16 months ago, when he ran a rooming house
at 110 Waller St., Vancouver, B. C., wished
his rival "good luck" a few hours before he
killed hitn.

Look?
I HEARD, the olhcr day, that women were adopting overalls to do housework in.
It seem-> that the idea came from across the seas, where women are doing
men'x work in the fields. It sounded a great deal like a story to me.
I.ater I wa« told F.leanor father, 6548 Palatine ave., a clothes model, who wears
latent gowns first, was interested in the o\eralls fad.
Miss father i'-n't the sort of person one associates with overalls at all. I wanted
her to pose in them so women readers of The Star could see how fetching they
were >he <amc to tnc in a charming *ilk fr"tk. very fluffy and very modern. That
is tl'c M>rt of thing --he usually wears the ultra modern.
She was very gracious in her willingness to wear the overalls.
She retired to don them.
When she returned she was clad completely in blue denim, from her dainty
pumps to her brown hair, and ><he was obviously pleased.
"I think it's the loveliest fad women have ever had." she told me "It isn't so
flagrantly foolish as most'of the drc*s crazes arc. In a costume of this sort one
is ready for anything, don't you think so?"
She whirled about so that we might see the overalls from all angles. They do
look sensible -no skirts to gather dust and interfere in any sort of work, and they
are undeniably becoming. At leaM they arc becoming to Mis* l ather.
"I wear just as many men's clothes as I very well can, anyway," she admitted.
"I have a love of a black and white silk shirt with a mannish collar and a man's tic.
Overalls are quite a new idea, tho, but I love them and wish they would become con
ventional attire for business women, as well a- housekeepers."

Sen. Poindexter's Policy of Government
Construction of Battleships Is Accept
ed by Conferees and City's Payroll
Will Jump $3,000,000
WASHINGTON (BULLETIN), Aug. 17.—The »enate thu
afternoon pasted the naval bill agreed to in conference
early in the day, without a roll call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17.—House and senate conferees
on the naval bill this afternoon agreed to retain the $6,000,-
000 appropriation to improve and equip the navy yards at
Puget Sound, Philadelphia, Norfolk, Boston, Portsmouth,
Charleston and New Orleans for construction of battleships.
The bill will be reported to both houses tomorrow. It
probably will be ready for the president's signature tomor
row or Saturday. L f
The senate amendment providing for investigation by a
commission of the advisability of establishment of a second
naval academy was stricken out. The item providing $500,000
for a suitable site on the Columbia river for a submarine and
torpedo base also went out.
The conference agreement brings to a successful close the
biggest constructive navy yard policy in the nation, and is a
triumphant feather in the cap for United States Sen. Miles
Poindexter, who introduced and fought for the plan to fit up
the Bremerton navy yard for government battleship construc
tion. His plan was jeered at by unfriendly Seattle newspa
pers at first, but they all came to his point of view when, much
to their surprise, the senate passed his bill.
The navy yard bill will bring to the Puget Sound navy yardL.
one of the biggest payrolls in the Northwest. Mechanics and
other skilled workers, to the number of 3,000, will probably be
employed, bringing a new payroll of $3,000,000.
To Seattle, the navy yard measure is of tremendous com
mercial value. It transfers from private shipyards in the
East to the government yard the construction of many battle
ships, running into millions of dollars.
The bill as it now stands authorizes the immediate equip
ment of four navy yards, including the Puget yard,
for battleship construction. The secretary of the navy is then
authorized to order the actual construction of a battleship here.
