SCHOOLS CLOSED
UNTIL SEPT. 25
Opening Date Tentatively
Set for Then Because
of the Plague.
Reports on the epidemic of infantile
paralvMs showed another marked de?
crease in casea and deaths yesterday.
Thirty fewer new ca_r_ were reported
lhan on Tuesday and live fewer deaths.
The new cases numbered 133 and the
deaths 34.
The Department of Health and thc
Board of Kducation definitely decided
yesterday that unless there was a
marked and unexpectcd reduetion in
the seriousness of the infantile paraly
I sis epidemic in the next three weeks
j the public schools would not be opened
j before September 2.. A definite date
! will be fixed about September 1 and an
nour.cemcnt will be made two weeks in |
advance of the opening of the schools. :
The decision was reached following (
correspondence between Ur. Haven
! Kmerson, Health Commissioner, and .
William 0. Wilicox, president of the j
Board of Kducation. In a letter to Mr. [
! Willcox, however, Dr. Kmerson said thc j
recommendations and rulings of the ?
1 Department of Health would not apply i
' to schools which only children over
aiatOOB years attended, and would not .
prevent the opening on September 11
of training schools.
ln his reply Mr. Willcox deelared
'? that the Board of Kducation would ?
; adopt whatever recommendations the
DepartflBeat of Health might make re
1 garding the schools.
Nurse Problem Solved.
One of the greatest problems which
i has confronted the Department of
! Health in its t'.ght against infantile
! paralysis getting enough competent
! nurses was partially solved yesterday
when William G. McAdoo, Seeretary of
the Treasury, telegraphed Commis?
sioner Kmerson that he had ordered the
relf-ase of the thirty Canadian nurses
held at Montreal by the I'nited Statea
immigration authorities. They left
Montreal for this city last nipht, the
department was informed.
Th? naraaa arere prevented from en
tering the United Stataa because of the
provison of the immigration laws which
prohibita the Importation nf contract
[abor. Secretarv McAdoo wired < oirt
oner Emeraon that in view of the
great need for the services of the
nurses the alien labor clause, for the

Some of these nurses, if not all, are
likely to be added to the staff which

Inferno on Somme
Deluge of Shells Furrows Plains of Picardy

By FRED B. P1TNEY.
Taris, Aug. lfi._I returneil to-day from a visit to the Freneh front
in thc Somme offensive aml that part of tkfl front extending south
toward Soissons from the actual rceno of present operations. It ?
prohablc that this southern sector will be the next part of the German
lines to fail before the methodically advancing Freneh forces.
In this visit I saw all the details of the gigantic organization thtt
goes to make up a modern victorious offensive. I crossed the ground
captured in the first five days of the great attack and crept slowly
forward into the very centre of the bombardment which the huge
organization in the rear feeds unremittingly night and day.
If you will lay out a parallelogram thirty miles deep by fifty miles
long and put at its northeastern corner a bulging arc with a chord twelve
miles long and a curve of twenty-six miles you will have approximately
the ground covered by the field of battle and the services of the rear

All roads from the paral'.elogram

chord of the arc as sticks of a fan lead
down to the handle, and, c-ossing the
chord, spread out again fanwise to
touch every point of the first lines.

the north. Leaving Amiens, we hur

of a sugar mill battered to pieces by

northern edge of the parallelogram,
and then, at a steep BBglfl. B*fl dove
down toward the centre of the chord,
where we once more turned and went
straight in.
Our progress into the battleficld

with the thumb screws and progressing
by rack and whcela to the "Iron

Not far from Amiens we were held

ALLIES CARRY
3=MILE FRONT
ALONG SOMME
Threat to Combles and
Peronne Increased
by Triple Assault
GERMANS YIELD
TO RUSH TACTICS
Success of Attacks Proves
Weakness of the Teu?
ton Grip.
[By Cabl* to Th* Trltmn- 1
London, Aug. 16. As an answer to
the German taunt that the Allied of?
fensive in Picardy was spent, the French
nidcd by the British, resumed the at?
tack to-day on both sides of the Somme.
N'orth of the river they took by storm
trenehe* ulonjj a front of more than
two miles and south of the river a line
three-quarters of a mile lonf*.
The heavy guns began the prepara?
tion for the attack early this morning.
For ?ix hours shells poured on what re
maincd of the German positions, nnd
then the infantry moved to the attack.
The assault pushed forward in three
divisions the lirst north of Maurepas,
the second between Maurepas and the
Somme and the third south of the
Somme. near Bclloy-en-Santerre.
Combles Threat ('row*.
Combles, an important position in
the German second position, is the ob
jective of the attacks north of the
Somme. Here the British are driving
eastward from Guillemont to the north,
while the French *>?. advancing from
Maurepas to 'he south, thus threaten
ing to pocket Combles.
In a joint operation both force* won
an entire line of OfllIflfl trenches along
a 1,500-metre front. At some points
the Guillemont-Maurepas highway was
reached.
Meanwhile to the south the French
were attacking the German positions
east of the Maurepas-Clery road. Mov
ing forward rapidly, they drove the
Germans from their trenches on a front
of more than a mile and then swept
on, clearing positions to a depth of
from 300 to 500 metres.
Thi* operation, in which many
prisoners were taken, -truightens out
the saliert ifl the French line north
of Peronne, and brings Foch's line
closer to Mount Saint yuentin. the im?
portant height north ot Peronne.
French Win South of Somme.
South of the Somme the name rush
tactics also succeeded. A strong sys?
tem of German trenches, south of
Helloy-en-Santerre, extending on a
front of three-quarter* of a mile, was
carried. This gain aid* in straightett
mg th" French line iouth of Peronne
and al<o drive- further eastward the
Wfldffl that project.4 north of Chaulnes.
While these attacks to-day did not
cut deip enough into the German lines
to be highly important in a military
sense, their moril etTect la great, com?
ing at a time when the Germans are
engaged bu'ily in proving that their
front in Picardy cannot be broken.
(ierman* Slo-alv Driven Baek.
The Allied gains to-day demonstrated
that assaults can still drive baek the
German line, surely if slowly. They
-h..wed, too, that these attacks can
?BOflfled if they are launched on a com
paratively wide front, and that the
Rritish and the Freneh in a cornbined
otTensive can still gain ground.
Herlin reports that the battle of
Pozieres has died down and the Brit?
ish oflieial .statement to-night does not
contradict this. But Haig tells of A
heavy toir.bardment, such as always
precedes an rttack in the West.
Weather co ulitions are now improving
nnd there is likehhood of a new ad?
vance in the near future.
Day's Official Reports
on Somme Offensive
Paris, Aug. 1>>.?To-night's Frevch
gtatcment snys:
On the Somme front thi* afternoon,
after an intense artillery preparation,
we launched an offensive which brought
us important gains. N'orth of Maure?
pas. assisted by the British, we capt?
ured an entire line of German trenehe*
on a front of 1,500 metres. rcaching at
certain points the Guillemont-Maurepas
road.
South of Maurepas, on a front of two
kilometre* and to a depth of '100 to 600
metres, our infantry occupied all
enemy position* east of the Maurepas
Clery road, after a sharp attack. which
cost the enemy heavily. Thesa two
operation*, brilliantly and rapidly eon?
ducted, resulted in the capture of a
considerable number of prisoners,
whose number* are not >rt obtainable.
At the same time, south of the
Somme, our troops, attacking with a
rafltg, captured a powerfully organized
system of German trenches on a length
of 1,200 metres south of Beiloy-en
Santerre, capturing sixty prisoner*.
There was an intermittent cannonade
on the remainder of the front.
French Early Report.
An earlier announcement read:
The night wa* calm on the greater
part of the front.
In the Champagne, in the region of
Tahurc, and in the Argonne toward
Hurazee, we di*per*ed some German
patrols.
On the Verdun front there wa* a
fairly lively bombardment in the

those who fought at Verdun
should occupy the first ranks.

.r.otn a StflIT C-rT__.p-_.eM of Tbe Trlbnre ]
Washington, Aug. lt..?President
Wilson is prepared fer a final show
down to-morrow with the employes
and managers of the railroads. A
definite plan of settlement, evolved
from the conferences of the last
three days, will be submitted to both
sides. The unions probably will ac?
cept it. The railroad managers un
doubtedly will object. It seems like?
ly to-night that unless the President
can force them, they will refuse it.
Three times since the conference
committee of managers came to
Washington has their vote in secret
meetings been unanimous against
the principal features of the pro
jected plan. Realizing that their
backs are against the wall, they are
determined to insist on arbitration.
The atake3 are so high they may
even defy the President and take
their chanct-s with the public.
The President has fortified himself
against that stand. At his request.
the 600 union delegates of the four
great railway brotherhoods wero
brought to Washington to-night on
two special trains. The President
intends to present his plan to the
whole body and iet them take it or
leave it. Their acceptance, however,
is contingent on thj aetion of the
managers. But if the settlement is
rejected by either, President Wilson
will put the blame on the blocking
side in a statement to the people
setting forth the situation.
Presldcnt'a Peaee Plan.
The terms of the proposed settle?
ment, as foreeast in The Tribune thia
mornini*. are these:
An eight-hour day for the engi?
neers, firemen, conductors and train?
men, on the present basis of ten
hour pay.
? ivirtime to be paid pro rata as at
present.
The employes to waive f.r the
present their demand for punitive
time-and-a-half pay for overtime.
The railroads to di_card their
counter proposals.
Provision to be made to prevent
the railroads from esraping the
eight-hour day in operation.
A special commi?sion to be ap?
pointed to consider the whole con
troveny.
This commission to report es?
peeially on two questions: Whether
it is necessary to have punitive over?
time to guarantee to the men an ac?
tual eight-hour day. as they main
tain, and whether the cost to the
railroads of the ei|_ht-hour seh.'dules
will be, as the roads contend, $100,
000,000.
Thc commission's report to be the
basis for probable rate inereases by
the Interstate Commerce Commis?
sion, any reeom nendation of the
President on the raaflfltiofl of rate in?
ereases to be predicate.l on the spe?
cial commission's verdiet.
It arill be raadlly aaaa that in thia
proposal I'resident Wilson has taken
a middle ground, although the eight
hour day provision is a vietory for the
employes. lt is also appan-nt that after
the commission's report, which will not
be bir.ding except as it may have pub?
lic opinion behind it, the whole con
troversy may be opened again.
President Not Optlmistlc.
The Pi-e?ident is not optimistic about
the reccntion of his plan. He realiien
the unions are with him because tha
men, who say th.-y want only the bet?
ter workintf and Irving conditiona
which thc eight-hour day means, would
got substanlially what they a?k. He
also knows tho greatest concessiona
are demanded from the railroad mana?
gers and therefore almost the entira
weight of his endeavors has been
directed toward breakin_- down their
objections.
Tln- union men feel they are not
yielding anything by agreeing to tha
tai?l of the plan. Thev are just a*
netermined as they ever were ?nd just
B8 ready to fight. In fact, it would not
'.,.? listaatafBl to them to face the issue
s^uarely, call the threatered strike and
take their chance of winn.na. The rail?
road managers feel that if they yield
w-.thout a struggle, it is financial *ui
cide, but if they are foreed to meet a
strike, they ___IM_ they may have at
least a chance of winning.
