The French and British striking
with terrific force in three directions

most important points held by the
Germans in this sector have been
flanked on both sides, according to

BIG NAVAL PLAN
HAS BEEN RATIFIED
Only Minor Details of Measure Now
Remain to be Worked Out.
Washington, Aug. 16. Xavy officers
virtually have before them today the
task of carrying out the largest pro
gram for building warships ever adopt
ed with a single appropriation by any
nation.
Although technically not completed,
the naval bill, carrying $315,800,000,
has been approved in its main pro
visions by congress, and is in the
hands of a conference committee only
to settle minor differences between the
house and senate on navy yard ap
propriations. Anticipating speedy disposition of
the remaining questions, the navy de
partment already has begun plans for
putting into effect provisions of the
big building policy and increased per
sonnel features approved yesterday by
the house. The senate's building pro
gram was ratified by a vote of 2S3 to
51. and the personnel increase by a
vlve voce vote. Senate increases in
appropriations for navy yards were
disagreed to, and it was voted to send
the bill back to conference for deter
mination of these points.
Indications today are that the con
ferees will reach an early agreement
on the questions still in dispute, and
that the bill will be laid before Presi
dent "Wilson for his approval in a few
days.
Increases written into the bill by the
senate and approved by the house pro
vide for the construction of 157 war
vessels within the next three years
and an enlisted strength of 74.700 men.
Navy officials, including Secretary
Daniels, are greatly pleased with the
bill. The secretary characterized it as
a model of its kind. He declared also
that buildinsr authorizations were the
greatest ever passed in any country,
and would place the United States
second among the world's navies.

PORTLAND ADVERTISING
CLUB HEARS HUGHES.
Commercial Preparedness For Euro
pean Competition.
Portland, Oregon, Aug. 16. Charles
E. Hughes in an address to the Port
land Advertising club in which he ad
vocated commercial preparedness for
European competition through the
agency of a protective tariff today
bra.nded as a traitor to his country
the man who sought to build up his
private fortune at public expense.
"The man who tries to get the bet
ter of the public for his private purse,"
the nominee said, "is a traitor to the
government. We will go ahead and
put these traitors out of business
while we build up the business of the
T'nited States."
The commercial problems which the
country will face after the war, Mr.
Hughes said, will be greater than ever
before.
"We must save this country every
day. It won't be saved by letting it
drift. It won't be saved by taking
everything for granted. Its indus
tries won't be conserved by indulging
in good wishes around the club table.
We have got to take account of the
lessons learned on the other side and
apply them. We have got to con
sider honest business with the suc
cess and pride that it deserves and we
have got to fearlessly condemn
abuses.
"We now need the motive power of
unswerving loyalty ami a real con
sciousness of national principle which
will fill us with a dominant sense of
loyalty t othe United States.
"With that we want a real gov
ernment. Wc want to be well prepar
ed, well organized commercially and
industrially. We have got. to match
organization with organization. pre
paredness abroad with preparedness
at home in all things."
In opening his address, Mr. Huches
declared that, while he was speaking
to the Portland Advertising club, he
was a. member of the Republican Ad
vertising club.
"For the present I am spokesman
of that organization," he continued,
"It was not ever thus."
After the laughter which greeted
this remark had subsided the nominee
conSinued.
"A short time ago. I was loner on
silence and short of talk; now I am
long on talk and short on silence. The
reason is that I was mandamused in
Oregon."
In speaking of preparedness Mr.
Hughes said:
"I desire to see the United States
holding its head erect among the
peoples of the earth, not trembling,
not blustering, but ready for any
emergency. We have in this country
opportunity that dazzle the imagin
ation After his address Mr. Hughes went !
for a four hour automobile ride along

OPENING OF NEW YORK
SCHOOLS POSTPONED
Deemed Advisable Because of Infan
tile Paralysis Epidemic.
Xew York, Aug. 16 While Septem
ber 25 was set today as the tentative
date for opening the public schools of
this city, postponed from September
11 because of the epidemic, Health
Commissioner Haven Emerson said it
was by no means certain that Xew
York's 1,000,000 school children under
16 years of age could resume their
studies as early as that. Definite plans
cannot be made. Dr. Emerson inform
ed William G. Willcox, president of
the board of education, because it is
impossible to foresee whether the dis
ease can be checked or whether the
epidemic will assume still greater pro
portions. He declared, however, that
it would be "highly inadvisable" to
attempt to open the grammar schools
before September 25.
Another decrease in deaths rind new
cases today ecnouraged the health au

here next week, to be followed soon
by 300 more. The value of monkeys.
l'. is said, has risen from

President Drafts
Settlement Plan
WILL SUBMIT IT TO MANAGERS
AND EMPLOYES TOOAY
OUTLOOK IS BRIGHTER
General Committee of 640 Representa
tives of the Various Brotherhoods
Are in Washington.
Washington, Aug. 16. President
Wilson today " completed a definite
plan for settlement of the threatened
nation-wide railroad strike and will
submit it t'o representatives of the
managers and employes tomorrow.
The proposition framed by the pres
ident following conferences with the
managers and employes since Monday
morning proposes that the railways
should concede the eight hour work
day, with an agreement that it will be
observed. Later it probably will be
proposed that a federal commission
appointed by the president or created
by congress investigate all problems
which have arisen during the present
discussion.
Arbitration an Obstacle.
The chief obstacles in the way of
acceptance of the plan lie in the in
sistence of the railroad managers on
arbitration and their opposition to an
eight hour day, and in the demand of
the employes for extra pay of time and
a half for overtime.
The general committee of the em
ployes, including S40 representatives of
the trainmen and enginemen on the
225 railroad systems of the country,
arrived here tonight in response to a
summons by their sub-committee
which had been meeting with uhe pres
ident. The general committee has
plenary powers to accept or reject any
suggestion.
The men, although refraining from
discussion of the plan, said they
thought the outlook encouraging for a
settlement.
Statement at 3 p. m. Today.
At 3 o'clock tomorro wafternoon the
president will meet the entire general
committee of 640 in the east room of
the White House and lay before them
his plan. Ho will accompany it with a
statement appealing to their patriot
ism and urging a compromise in the
interests of the people of the nation.
While no time has been set for a
conference between the managers'
committee and the president, it is
thought probable it will take place to
morrow morning. When Mr. Wilson
sees the managers he will make virtu
ally the same statement he wiil de
liver to the employes, paying particular
attention, however, to the points he
feels the managers should "oncede.
Statistics Compiled by Experts.
The president completed his plan
during a conference today with Judge
William L. Chambers of the federal
board of mediation and conciliation,
who took to the White House statistics
compiled by experts shewing the prob
a'ble cost to the railroads of the grant
ing of a basic eight hour da. Imme
diately afterward Judge Chambers
talked briefly with the managers' com
mittee. He did not confer -with the
employes' representatives.
No White House Meeting Yesterday.
The conference between the presi
dent and Judge Chambers was the
only formal meeting of the day in con
nection with the situation. There was
no White House conference with the
managers and employes pending the
arrival of the brotherhoods' general
committee from Xew York and the
drawing up" of a definite plan by Mr.
Wilson. The managers spent the day
in informal mceting.s and conferences
at their hotel. The employes' repre
sentatives rested at their hotel.
The president is depending largely
upon public opinion to force a settle
ment. Should the present method of
procedure seem ahout to fail, it was
thought probable today he would take
the public into his confidence.
Discussion of the creation of a fed
eral commission to investigate the
railroad situation centered largely to
day around the contention of railroad
officials that such a commi.ssion would
be able to get at all the facts and
prevent a recurrence of the present
crisis.
WINCHESTER MACHINISTS

Unless the Company Agrees to Grant
Them an Eight Hour Day.
New Haven, Conn., Aug. 16 Ma
chinists employed at the Winchester
Repeating Arms company nere to

ber of the executive committee of the

Walk out, members of nil metal tiades
organizations at the plant will also
strike, involving 10.000 men. The
company employes about 18.000 hands.
The men demand, in addition to the
eight hour day, time and one-half for
overtime, recognition of the shop com
mittee, and increased pay for piece
workers. The plant is run on a ten

ed to make any statement on the sit
uation tonight. L'ntil recently there
have been no unrest among '.he work
men. Last fall, a machinists' union

LANSING TO INFORM
SENATE COMMITTEE
About Treaty for Purchase of the
Danish West Indies.
Washington, Aug. 16. Secretary
Lansing was asked today to appear
Friday before the senate foreign rela
tions committee to answer questions
relating to the treaty for purchase of
the Danish West Indies. The commit
tee, at its first meeting to consider the
treaty, decided a personal explanation
from the secretary would be necessary
to satisfy some of the members re
garding details relating to business
concessions in the islands and to the
purchase price.
, Some of the senators on the com
mittee, although they favor the pur
chase, believe the $25,000,000 asked by
Denmark is exorbitant, especially m
view of the fact that she offered to sell
them for $5,000,000 in 1902.
The committee will question Mr.
Lansing particularly, however, about
business concelssions which the United
States by the terms of the convention
proposes to maintain. Among these
are a license to a company called "Det
Vestindiske Tvompagni," giving it
rights to drain, deepen and utilize cer
tain areas in St. Thomas harbor and
preferential rights as to commercial,
industrial or shipping establishments
in the harbor. Another concession gives
the same company the right to supply
electric lights for the city of Charlotte
Amalie.
Included also are references to a
concession to the Floating Drydock
company of St. Thomas, relating to
the floating dock in the harbor; sub
sidiaries to the Indian Telegraph, con
cessions for establishment and opera
tion of a telephone system in St.
Thomas and St. Croix, and various
other business concessions.
Senator Stone, chairman of the com
mittee, -said tonight the treaty would
proibably not be reported to the senate
until next week.
