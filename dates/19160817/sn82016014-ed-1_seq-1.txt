'SAFETY FIRST
Demands for Enactments Curb
ing Judicial Power.
Minimum Gas Question Could
Have Been Settled.
Capper Announces His Latest
Course in Gas Fight.
WON'T TRUST TO DEMOCRATS
Governor Will Walt Until He
Has Republican Senate.
Vigorous Action Against Power
of Court in Kansas.
Governor Capper announced today
he would ask for a legislative investi
eation of the gas question. He is also
considering impeachment proceeding"
against Judge John R- Flannelly ox
Montgomery county, who is to be
haled before the state senate. De
mands will also be made on the legis
lature for enactments curbing judicial
power and fat fees in receiverships.
The governor's drastic program of
procedure in the Kansas Natural gas
litigation was announced today before
he started for Clay county. It is not
the governor's plan to call a special
session of the legislature. He does not
care to entrust the Flannelly matter to
the Democrat senate. Expense of a
special session is also great. So the
governor will wait until the new leg
islature comes to Topeka in January.
In a discussion of the gas contro
versy today Governor Capper made
clear that he proposed to carry the
gas fight to a finish. He will continue
his indictment of the gas receivership
in his speeches' during the campaign
and will urge legislative action. He
will take his program before the leg
islature and will ask for a joint in
vestigation of the gas receivership, the
big fees and the action of Judge Flan
nelly of the Montgomery county dis
trict court.
Criminal IToseontion May Follow.
That criminal prosecutions might
follow the findings of the legislative
committee is one of the actions re
garded as most probable In the gover
nor's drastic program for action
against persons connected with the
gas receivership. The legislative com
mittee will have power to take- testi
mony and make findings and recom
mendations to the governor. The gov
ernor may then direct the attorney
general to bring criminal or civil pro
ceedings against persons involved.
"I shall certainly ask for a legisla
tive investigation of this receivership
matter." said the governor. "It is a
disgrace to the state and I propose to
go to the bottom of it. In view .if the
fact that the legislature meets m To
peka in a little more than four
months. I do not deem it wise, at this
time, to call a special session. How
ever. I have never said flatly that I
would not call a special session if an
emergency demand such action.
"Expense of a special session is
great and I believe the desired results
can be secured thru the next repcular
session. I shall ask not only for a
thoro investigation of the gas mat
ter by a joint committee from the two
houses, but shall also ask for most
positive legislation. This matter of
fat fees for receivers must be curbed,
as well as the action of courts in ap
pointing these receivers and allowing
the excessive fees. My plan Is to go
thoroly into the entire matter."
Governor Capper was asked if his
program included the citation of
Judge Flannelly before the state sen
ate for impeachment proceedings.
A Searching Investigation.
"That will most likely will be one
of the matters brought before the leg
islature," said the governor. "Just
the prne'dtre to be followed, I can
not say at this time, but I will stop
with nothing short of the most search
ing investigation."
The governor's declaration today
was the most sensational development
In the gas rate controversy. It followed
a number of speeches in which Gov
ernor Capper bitterly arraigned Judge
KKnnelly, the receivers and attorneys
In the case. Until today, however,
the governor had not positively out
lined his campaign of procedure, fur
ther than to announce that he would
demand .iissolution of the receivership
and complete removal of the cases
from Judge Flannelly's jurisdiction.
"This s a matter of state wi le con
cern and has become a stat? dis
grace." declared the governor. I shall
certainly dipevss ihe matter in public
places and believe the state will de
mand a full investigation of the case
and the mm connected with the gas
receivership."
Governor Capper was asked if he
anticipated action by the Republican
party council when the platform is
written in Topeka August 29.
"The council could do well by meet
ing this situation frankly and firmly,"
said the governor. "Personally I do
not believe I shall ask for a platform
plank touching the matter, but would
not be a.irprised if some such action
were taken "
Governor Capper left todav for
Green. Clay county, where he speaks
tnis afternoon at a joint picnic of
farmers from Clay, Washington and
Riley co-.inties. It is reported that the
governor will .liscuss the gas contro
versy in his Clay county speech.
GIVES ANOTHER $50,000
TO PROHIBITION CAMPAIGN
Indianapolis. Aug. 17. An addi
tional gift of $50,000 to the Na
tional Prohibition party's campaign
fund by Mr. and Mrs. John P. Cof
fin of Johnston. Fla., was an
nounced here todav. They pre
viously had given $50,000 to the
fund. The $100,000 is to be made
the nucleus for a campaign fund ot
$1,000,000. The gifts are in the
nature of property and Florida real
estate.
Bill in Legislature in 1915 Bnt
Capper Gave ?Jo Heed.
IT DIED ON HOUSE CALENDAR
Nothing in Governor's Message
to Indicate Support.
Act Provided That "o Minimum
Whatever Be Charged.
Governor Capper's zeal in con
demning the minimum rate, in the
gas controversy, is the result of a re
cent conviction, according to persons
who are in touch with some of the
governor's official acts of the last 18
months. Today it was pointed out
that Governor Capper failed to pro
test when the legislature went home
without passing the anti minimum
charge bill.
In both the 1913 and 1916 legisla
tive sessions a bill was before the
state legislature which would have
provided just the relief the state
seems to seek at this time. The mat
ter of a minimum charge for such
commodities as electricity, gas, water
and other service would have been
impossible under the proposed law.
Several Messages.
During the time the measure was
pending in the legislature. Governor
Capper Kent several special messages
to the law makers. On one occasion
he regarded pending appropriation
bills of such importance that he per
sonally went before both houses with
his message. . None of the messages,
however, mentioned the anti minimum
charge bill.
Legislative records show that in
troduction of the anti minimum
charge bill was made early in the
session and that after the bill had
been amended by the house utilities
committ?e, it was permitted to die on
the calendar. The house bill was in
troduced by Representative Holbrook
in 1913, while the senate bill came
from Senator Kinkle in 1915. Nothing
in the governor's mc-ssages or in the
efforts of the governor's leaders in
the two houses indicated that the ad
ministration favored the bill -which
would have provided relief in the
present gas controversy.
GREENHOUSE FIRE
Bass Plant Destroyed at a Loss
of $10,000.
Telephone Serrlce Fails and
Flames Spread,
The Ed Bass greenhouse, opposite
League park on East Fifteenth street,
is a total loss as a result of fire which
early this morning swept over the
plant. A two story residence occu
pied by the proprietor and his fam
ily and nine small buildings connected
with the greenhouse were totally de
stroyed. Damage Is estimated at $10,
000. When wagons from headquarters
fire station and station No. 3 reached
the greenhouse flames had completely
engulfed the residence and conserva
tory immediately behind it. Efforts of
firemen to save buildings burning
when they arrived were futile. They
directed their energies to saving sev
eral other greenhouses south of the
residence.
The fire is believed to have started
in the boiler house shortly after 4
o'clock. Mrs. Bass was awakened by
smoke and aroused her husband. Ef
forts to call the fire department were
unavailing when the telephone serv
ice failed. An alarm was not sounded
until 5:13 o'clock. Flames spread rap
idly over the dry buildings. From the
boiler houses they lapped their way
to the residence. In a few minutes
the building resembled a bonfire. Ef
forts to save furniture were h ?aded
off by the fire and only a sideboard
and sewing machine were saved.
Flames had covered the front part
of the house when Mrs. Bass recalled
that a young son, William was asleep
in an upstairs bedroom. Reaching the
child, Mrs. Bass carried him over the
roof, from which she jumped to a
greenhouse which was built adjoining
the residence.
Besides the house and furr.itnre, a
propagating house, the conservatory,
a buggy shed, a garage, pumping sta
tion, boiler house, south annex and
show room were destroyed by the fire.
The plant which was probably the
best equipped in the county, wa val
ued at $16,000. Less than half the
amount of the damage is covered by
insurance.
Hope which Mr. Bass connected to
a water faucet in an effort to fight
the flames before help arrived melted.
Neighbors arriving found him in his
night shirt attempting to move part
of his furniture out of reach of the
fire. Following the first excitement,
it was discovered that even Bass' trou
sers were destroyed. Clothing was
loaned him by neighbors this morning.
SALOON BANDITS BUSY
In Hour and a Half They Hold Up
Six Chicago Groggeries.
Chicago, Aug. 17. Four young
masked automobile bandits, one armed
j with a rusty revolver, started a series
i of saloon robberies in the southwest
i side of Chicago last night and lun
i ished on the north side after having
held up six saloons and obtained small
I amounts of money within an hour and
i a half.
j In one saloon seven men were driv
I en into a refrigerator, and told by one
of the bandits to "keep cool."
Canada Would Take Away
Baby From Sew Home.
WOULD ANNUL THE ADOPTION
Mrs. Ida Spencer Won't Give
Up the 6-Year-Old Girl.
Foster Mother and Daughter
Are Now Fondly Attached.
Two governments two world pow
ers will become involved in the fight
over one baby, and an orphan at that,
if Mrs. Ida Spencer, the mother by
adoption, continues to refuse to give
the child up willingly.
The child, a 6 year old girl, is a
British subject but is in Topeka with
Mrs. Spencer. She was adopted in
Canada when an infant and has been
with Mrs. Spencer ever since. She
was adopted from a Canadian orphan
age. Under the Canadian laws when a
child is adopted from an orphanage
the orphanage may annul the adoption
any time it sees fit, while the child is
a minor.
Altho Mrs. Spencer has had the
child for over five years the Home
from which she adopted it now sees
fit to annul the adoption and wants
the little girl back. Mrs. Spencer re
fuses to allow it to go. She is stand
ing pat and telling the Canadian or
phanage to get it if it can.
The Spencers lived in Canada when
the adoDtion was made but moved to
Topeka later. Some time since they
separated. The mother now has the
child. Evidently word of the separa
tion reached the Canadian orphanage
and is rsponsible for the decision to
recall the child.
Up to the Probate Judge.
Mrs. Spencer has had tlve matter tip
with the Provident association and the
Canadian concern is taking it up now
with the office of the probate judge.
The foster mother is having a hard
time but during the five or more
years she has had the baby she has
formed ruch an attachment for the
little girl that she does not now want
it taken from he. -Of course the little
girl doesn't want to leave- the foster
mother whom she looks upon as her
own mother. .
Local officials are wondering just
how the Canadians are going at it to
make good their declaration that they
will take the child. . Without legal
proceedings it would be in violation of
the law to take the child. Rad I-ee,
assistant county attorney, is of the
opinion that the matter must be token
up by Canadian officials with the fed
eral government before any move can
be made towards the removal of the
child. The foster mother stands ready
to combat any movement made to de
prive her of the child she has reared.
Thru the probate judge's office the
Canadian concern was notified today
that Mrs. Spencer refuses to turn the
child back to the orphanage without a
legal controversy.
ANYTHING TO GET HOME
Texas Guardsmen Shoot Off Fingers
and Toes for Dismissal.
Dallas, Texas, Aug. 17. National
guard'fcnen are being driven to des
peration by their enforced idleness on
the border and are choosing the two
most precarious methods to get home
desertion and self inflicted wounds.
This was the statement today of Tioy
Gambrell, former city fireman pnd
now connected with the hospital corps
of the Texas National Guard. He v.as
in Dallas to take a deserter back to
camp.
"There are between sixteen and
twenty men in the Texas National
Guard hospital at Marfa with bullet
wounds in their legs, feet and hands,
as a result of their trying to get their
release from border duty," said Gam
brell. "Since I have been down there
a large number of men have been bent
to the hospital who shot a finger or
toe off, but none of them have been
released. The officers decided in most
of the cases that the shooting was not
accidental. We have had a large num
ber of desertions lately. I know of
one man having deserted four times."
CHILE MAKES PROTEST
Emphasises to England Extent of
Damage to Its Commerce.
Santiago, Chile. Aug. 17t The
newspaper Mercurio urges that Chile
join other neutrals in a protest against
the British blacklist, emphasizing to
England the extent of the damage
done to Chilean interests.

CALL FOR PEACE
German People Would,
War at Any Cost.
End!
Strong Measures Fail to Sup
press the Agitation.
Rotterdam, Aug. 17. Thruout Ger
many the authorities have their hands
full confiscating and trying to trace
the source of pamphlets advocating1
peace at any price. This symptom of
revolt among a large section of the
people recently assumed . alarming
proportions. A few days ago there
was a house-to-house search in Ber
lin, resulting in the arrest of an edi
tor and printer associated with the
socialist organization.
Strongest measures, however, failed
to suppress this form of agitation
against war, which is so widespread as
to baffle the efforts of the military
and police. It is proof of the exist
ence of a great undercurrent of dis
content approaching rebellion among
the working classes of Germany.
SMOKY ROW BURN
Fire Destroys Oldest Structure
at the Poor Farm.
Main Building Was Saved Ow
ing to Favorable Wind.
"Smoky Row," the oldest structure
on the county poor farm, north of the
city, burned - to the ground shortly
after noon today. Fire is believed to
have started from a spark which
dropped on the roof of the building
from a chimney at the south end of
the structure.
Six invalids who were quartered in
"Smoky Row" were carried from the
building when fire was discovered. In
mates at the home exhibited little ex
citement, and those able to do so
joined a bucket brigade organized to
fight the flames. A chemical wagon
was rushed to the farm from North.
Topeka station but arrived too late to
save the building.
Favorable wind which blew from
the south saved the main building
south of "Smoky Row." A row of
chicken houses and several other
structures north of the burned build
ing were saved by the bucket brigade.
The fire lasted more than an hour.

Walt to Capture Mountains.
Rome, via Paris, Aug. 17. The Ital
ian army is being held back on the
Lower Isonzo until the line on Upper
Isonzo can be straightened by the cap
ture of the mountains of San Gabriel,
San Mario and other positions lying
between Tolmlno and Goritz. While
the capture of these mountains is re
garded as Imminent, there probably
will be no advance upon Trlest ut-til
they have been taken. The Austrians
are being forced off the Carso plateau
before spirited attacks of the Italian I
troops, roused to enthusiasm by re
cent victories. j
Fierce fighting for the heavy guns
which have been barring the way to
Triest is in progress. These guns fre
quently are emplaced in caverns on
the mountain side. In taking Sainte
Grado Monday, the Italians offered to
let one of the sun crews surrender,
but the Austrians flourished a mando
lin In derision, the Austrians often
calling the Italians merely mandolin
players. An Italian infantry .detach
ment bayonetted the whole gun crew.

French Attack Trl-Sided.
Paris, Aug. 17. Operations on three
different parts of the Somme front
yesterday resulted in the removal of
some of the barriers of the powerful
German defensive system. A resiimp
of the methodical "drive of the
tion
French troops after the disappearance
of these obstacles in expected to bring
further grains in the region of Gullle
mont and Maurepas. In the actions
yesterday the French attained an as
cendancy over their adversary during
the fighting around the Gulileuiont
Maurepas road.
The Germans still have a hold In the
northwest part of Maurepas but the
French, by reason of their success in
that vicinity, have a dominating posi
tion and are menacing the German
communications.
South of the Somme. the German
trench system around Belloy-En-San-
terre was a real fortified work which
had resisted numerous previous bom-
bardments. Its character now permits
further progress in that section.
NEW WAR SHOCK!
PRICE OF BABIES
NOW $100 MORE
London, Aug. 17. It is estimated
that the all-around expenditure on a
baby born this year is probably from
S100 to S125 higher than in 1914.
Food alone adds about SI 5 to the
year's cost of the war-baby. Milk has
gone up 4 cents a quart and it Is said
that the average baby consumes from
400 to 450 pints a year. Baby foods
are up about 10 per cent. Feeding
bottles cost a third more, and the
methylated spirit for heating the
night's feed has advanced from 10
cents to 25 cents a pint.
Baby garments cost more also.
Everything made of wool has risen 83
per cent in price; all the cotton and
woll mixture materials and garments
are 25 per cent higher, and the wholly
cotton ones, owing to the rise in raw
materials and labor, must be paid for
at the rate of about 15 per t:ent more.
Even Baby's Bath Costs More.
Even a baby's bath costs about one
third more;, soap is a third dearer,
the bath thermometer is up about 25
per cent, toilet powder chiefly be
cause of the rise In the price of the
boric acid it contains is IOC per cent
dearer. -
Nearly all medicines cost i.iuch
more.
Perambulators are about one-fourth
dearer. What formerly was sold for
$15 is now 820 and so on. A cot that
could be bought before the war fot $5
is now 87.50; the fleecy wool mattteas,
babySf basket and baby's Mgh chair
are all up proportionately.
Nurse's wages have advanced $5 or
more and her keep is costing at least
one-third more an increase of Sa or

In the threatened railroad strike has
reached a point which makes it high
ly desirable that I should personally

In Historic East Room
Washington, Aug. 17. The histor
ical East Room of the White House
was ready today for the enactment
of what may be one of the closing
incidents in the titanic struggle be
tween the four powerful brotherhoods
of railway employes and the operators
of the railways of the United States. ,
Six hundred and four district chair,
men of the railroad workers are her
to meet the president this afternoon
In the East Room. The president has
ready for them his suggestion ot a
solution of the situation that has men
aced the country for the past several
weeks.
The definite terms of the president's
proposal are not known, but the basic
idea is an agreement to be made be
tween the railroads and the brother-
I hoods, whereby the eight hour day
shall go into effect at once. With this
in effect, the question of methods of
enforcing It whether by means of the
time and a half for overtime, or by
some other means will be made the
subject of investigation and adjust
ment, with the federal government
perhaps taking part in the adjustment.
The railroad brotherhoods nave In
sisted steadily that there is no ither
effective method of enforcing the.
eight hour day.
President Faces Problem.
The president's problem If the
railroads definitely concede the eight-
hour principle to the extent of agree
ing to give it a trial seems to be t
i convince the railroad men that the
time and a half overtime issue should
