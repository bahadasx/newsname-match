High water mark in the financial Ins

this morning when Ralph O Wunder
lich, serrriary-manager of thr Oklaho

reported that clearings f ir the week

Each Week New Record. I
F.very wrrk for the past two months

ages of imrease have almost invariably i
ranged around 75 percent over the same I
week in thr prereeding year i
Clearings last week were $4,550,180
Explains Increase. !
Mr. Wuuderlich attributes the record
clearings to a certain extent to the
movement of Oklahoma grain to this
city and to the unprecedented prosper- !
ity of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City
in grurral. llr is at a loss, however,
to account for sin h an unexprctrd
showing.
Wheat has been moving into the lo
cal market for the past month; cotton
is just beginning to move, as are other
less staple crops. These conditions, to
gether with general building operations
and local prosperity are the causes of
the piling of record on record, he
thinks.

by thr rrfusal of the manag

hoods, President Wilson has summoned
' M ,mc v ' r . " '. nr , n,ay
vite to the White House the financiers
who control them. Officials said today
that he wants to deal with the "ultimata
authority" on both sides.
Refusal Definite.
The presidrnt is ready to propose)
that the rail.oads concede the eight
hour day as a basis of settlement. It
probably will be suggested later that a
federal commission be appointed by the
president or created by eongress to in
vestigate other issues involved.
The president's action irt asking for
the conference with rsilroad presidents
jthat the managers' committee had fin
ally refused to concede the eight-hour
day as the president's plan proposed,
and the question now is to be taken up
with the heads of the railroads them
selves. Unable to Agree.
The situation as it standi today Is:
The railroads flatly refuse to
concede the eight-hour day, but are
willing to arbitrate that question
and alt others before any tribunal
the president or the men may de
cide on.
The men are willing to arbitrate
some questions under certain con
ditions and are not willing to arbi
trate others.

Situation Delicste.
Another indication of the delicacy of
the situation was seen in the drcision at
the White House not to make public tha
president's remarks to the men, not at. '
this tint- at least. It was at first in- (
tended to publish the president's state
ment and then his statement to the man
agers, thus laying the esse brfore tha
high court of public opinion. It wss
believed that while there was hope of
moving the committee of managers by
apprals to the president or stockhold

fidential. Many Presidents Invited.
