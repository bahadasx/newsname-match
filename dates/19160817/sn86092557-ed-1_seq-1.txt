GAINES PLEASES PAHTY
Republican Candidate for U.
S. Senate Completes
Tour of State.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian.)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 17.?
Congressman Howard Sutherland is
back tn his seat iu the House of Rep
resentatives alter a short tour through
a number of counties in the state look
ing after his candidacy for the United
Slates Senate, and getting a first
hand view of the political situation iu
the state as it affects the prospects of
the entire Republican ticket. He took
advantage of the lull in legislative
work in the House to see what's do
ing iu various sections of West Vir
ginia.
Mr. Sutherland doesn't care to be
quoted about his own candidacy, very
likely for the reason that it might look
like bragging and hence might bo of
doubtful propriety. It Is, however,
merely a statement of a well known
fact to say that the Congressman-at
large from West Virginia thinks his
election to the upper branch of Con
gress about as strong a foregone con
clusion as anything which is to happen
can be. In that respect, his opinion
coincides precisely with the opinion
held by nil Republicans and a major
ity of Democrats.
The biggest Democratic leaders
when discussing the Sutherlirad-Chil
ton contest privately, frankly admit
that there isn't the faintest likelihood
of defeating Sutherland. They go
even further than that and forecast
that his majority will bo the largest
in the state, based on their knowledge,
which they frankly admit, that there
Is a faction in their own party which
as they put it. "have it in for Senator
Chilton and arn biding their time until
the election 'tp get him,'" The word
lias gone down the line In that fac
tion, according to certain Democrats
who are well known lenders in their
respective communities, to "get" Sen
ator Chilton. In some of Hie counties
there are influential Democrats who
are opening proclaiming that they will
vote for Sutherland. It Isn't question
ed by any one but he will receive the
vote of his own party practically to a
man.
As to the balance of the ticket. Con
gressman Sutherland said today:
"The situation In the state as I found
it looks bright for the Republican tick
et throughout. There isn't a doubt in
my mind but v/hnt r.ie state will be
carried by Hughes ai ! Fairbanks by
a very large majority. Our party vot
ers are well pleased with the national
nominees and express themselves to
that effect with enthusiasm. The op
position are loudly claiming that they
have a good chance to elect a govern
or. I certainly failed to find condi
tions in our party to justify their hope.
Judge Robinson is gaining strength
with the voters daily, and bo far as that
particular situation is concerned I can
say that it has improved immeasura
bly, and I predict that it will continue
to Improve until Judgo Robinson has
behind him a reunited, wideawake and
active party. That will mean his elec
tion, of course. As to the rost of the
ticket, there isn't the least doubt In
my mind of its success at the polls.
"I found that, so far as the rank and
file of our voters arc concerned, they
want to win. and that is a healthy sign
of a sweeping victory with us, when
It is considered that the state is nor
mally Republican by approximately
25,000 to 30,000.
"The solection of Hon. Joseph Holt
Gaines as state chairman, and Hon.
Charles G. Coffman as secretary, as
well as Hon. David Gideon as treas
urer of the campaign, has had a most
salutary efTect. Mr. Gaines is an able
lawyer and statesman, and a high
class citizen, as everybody knows. He
has the confidence and respect of the
public. I prophesy that his conduct
of the campaign will result In a splen
did party victory."
YOUNG MARRIED COPLE RETURN.
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Jones are now
