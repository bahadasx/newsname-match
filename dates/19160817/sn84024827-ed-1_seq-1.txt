British, striking with terrific force
in three directions on the Somme

of German trenches, driving forward
at points to a depth of 300 to 500

The most important gains were
made by the British and French
troops striking north from t'.ie point
where the allied lines meet. Maure

in this section, have been flanked on
both sides, according to the official

NEW YORK. AUK. 16. Another
strike of conductors and niotoriiieu
employed by the New York Railways
company will be declared "forthwith"
unless the company grants recognition
of the Union, according to resolutions
adopted at mass meeting of the men
tonight.
The situation has become so acute
that 'Mayor Mitchell and Oscar Straus,
chairman of the public service com
mission, are said to have been sum
moned to the city, the former from
Plattsburg and the latter from Maine.
Theodore P. Shontz, president of the
Internum Raniil Transit and the New

addressed to the mayor and Chairman I
tonight called attention to the
u't,IIiatunl delivered to Inm ly the
employes committee, which charged
l"t the New York Railways company
ha1 vioIa,el! tIle agreement of August
7 which brought the strike of surface
car lines to an end.
Mr. Shontz denied that his company
had discharged workers because of
their affiliation with the Carmens'
Union and added that in "many cases
employes ' of this company have
clearly violated the rules of this com
pany, some of the violations increas
ing the hazard and endangering the
safety of the passengers on our cars."
The resolutions of the carmen after
urging their leaders to call a suspen-
sion of work on all lines oi tne isew
lork Railways company unless a sat
isfactory understanding can be reach
ed tomorrow, declares that the com
pany for five days past has failed to
comply with request for a conference
with the employes. The resolution
not only reiterates the men's claims
that the company indiscriminately dis
charged employes who were active in
the recent strike, but accuse the emu-

WASHINGTON. Aug. 1. Today

solutions was found, the outcome of the president's mediation is expected to
depend largely on the attitude of the two sides toward the plan he has
drawn up.
The proposition by the president following the conferences made the
proposal that the railroad should concede the eight-hour work day with an
agreement that it would be observed. It probably will be proposed that a
federal commission, appointed by the president or created by congress in-
vestigate all problems which have arisen during the administration.
!
j Chief obstacles in the way of acceptance of the plan lie in the insistence
of the railroad managers on arbitration and the opposition to the eight-hour
day and the demand for time and a half for overtime. Whether the two
sides will give in on these points constituted the chief danger in the situation
tonight.

When Mr. Wilson sees the managers be will make practically the same state
ment he will deliver to the employes, paying particular attention, however,
to the points he feels the managers should concede. The president completed
his plan during a conference today with Judge Wui. L. Chambers of the fed
eral board of mediatian and conciliation, who took to the White House sta
tistics compiled by experts showing the probable cost to the railroads of the
granting the eight-hour day. Immediately afterwards Judge Chambers talked
briefly with the managers' committee. He did not confer with the employes'
representatives.
