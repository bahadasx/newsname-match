PROWGKRJSIBE
Of SHELLS MADE
BY THE ENTENTE
Often 90,000 are Dropped in
Single Hour on'Somme
Front.
Headquarters of German Army
Group on the Somme Front, Satur
day, Aug. 18.—(Via Berlin to Lon
don, Aug. 17.)—The expenditure of
artillery ammunition by the entente
allies on this front has reached a
prodigious volume, often striking the
rate of 32 shells a second during
drum-fire. Not infrequently along the
entire Somme front, nearly 90,000
shells have been dropped in an hour,
while a conservative estimate puts
the average for tlie 24 hour period
at more than 1,000,000 shells.
With this rate of flre, the financial
cost of the offensive is naturally
high. What the approximate losses
in human material amount to, it is
difficult to estimate. That the losses
of the British in certain action have
been frightful is. affirmed by German
officers, who on the other hand,
frankly admit that their losses have
been far from light though all insist
that they were not nearly so heavy
as the British.
The German expenditure in am
munition has been much lighter than
of the British for the reason that the
German artillery concentrates its ef
forts on special objects such as
trenches, transports and reserve bas
es, while the British often screen off
whole sectors, taking nightly under
their fire all the villages and roads
behind the German lines within the
range of their guns.

Seattle Scene of Bomb Out
rage—Three Men Nar
rowly Escape.
Seattle, Wash., Aug. 17.—The tim
bers in the southeastern corner of
pier D, at. the foot of King street,
were blown down and a shack built
alongside the pier was entirely de
stroyed early today, when a bomb
placed near the street end of the pier
exploded.
Thomas. McLoughlln, night watch
man, saw sparks from the fuse, and
thinking it was fire, routed from the
shack three dock workers who were
sleeping there. None was injured.
It was learned that there was one
previous attempt during the night to
blow up the wharf of the Pacific Coast
Steamship company. Prompt action
by employes in each case prevented
serious loss.
The police are working on the the
ory that the men who set the bomb
believed the structure on the wharf
was used as sleeping quarters by non
union dock workers employed on the
pier. A close investigation is being
conducted by authorities and' arrests
may follow.
MISSIONARIES GO
TO SERBIAN FIELD
New York, Aug. 17.—A party of
five missionaries attached to the Pres
byterian board of foreign missions
left here today on board the Danish
steamship Oscar II for service in Per

William A. Shedd, head of the board's
work in Urumia, and will consist of
Miss Leonore Schoebel, of Holton,

from a vacation that was granted him
by the board last October.
STRIKERS* EVICTED.
Little Rock, Ark., Aug. 17—-Strik
ing employes of the American Baux
ite company at Bauxite, were ordered
yesterday to vacate in fifteen days the
homes they are occupying if they are
unwilling to return to work. The
company owns virtually every house
in the town of about 600 people.
The next day, lawyers for the
steamship company made a deter
mined fight to obtain a hearing on
the case. This was finally granted
and at the hearing Captain C. W.
Chambers testified to his protest to
the British naval authorities against
the seizure and presented a copy of
the document together with the offi
cial receipt of the British authorities
to prove his point that neither he nor
the steamship company was respon
sible for non-delivery of the cargo.
After considering the case a day,
Collector Stanley announced that he
had fined the vessel $12.50 for each
missing package. This meant a total
fine of approximately $25,000. The
law says the fine may be Imposed
provided negligence on the part of the
ship or Its officers is shown. The
agents rely on this provision to ob
tain a remission.
The Chinese Prince was the first
vessel to reach Manila from which
cargo had been taken by the British
authorities.

officials from throughout the country,
officials of the pu$Uc health service
and prominent 'sepMUists, today began
a discussion of for combating

mendatory, the co-ofdlnation of reg
ulations is needed to avoid unneces
sary inconveniences, and still give
adequate protection to the public."
The conferees agreed that their
figures showed over 10,000 cases in
the United States, but outside of New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut and
Pennsylvania, the situation is prac
tically normal.

"War Usury Bureau" Al

The Hague, Aug. 17.—The new
German "war usury bureau" has Just
ified its' existence by revealing sur
prising details of widely ramified
food frauds, according to reports re
ceived here, which frauds are said to
involve a half dosen leaders and a
hundred accomplices. These men
are said to have smuggled hundreds
of tons of wheat, rye and barley flour
from the province of West Prussia to
Berlin, where it was sold at a profit
of 800 per cent.
The existence of the flour, reports
say, was concealed from government
stock-takers by all kinds of artifices
and was shipped on night trains as
potatoes or machinery. Among the
accomplices and ringleaders were
several government officials and sev
eral station masters who are charged
with connivance in the fraud by con
signing flour under false descrip

German newspapers are demanding
exemplary punishment for the men
arrested.

Dr. Anderson Tells of Ex

Regions.
Nome, Alaska, Aug. 17.—Six mem
bers of the Vilhjalmur- Stefansson
Arctic expedition arrived here on the
power schootier Alaska, related their
experiences in the polar regions dur
ing the last-three years. Stefanesoit,
who remained in the Arctic .to con
tinue his work of exploring newly dis
covered land north of Prince Patrick
land, probably will not return to civ
ilization the present season, they said.
The party aboard the Alaska was
under Dr. Rudolph Anderson. Stefans
son's chief subordinate, who had been
exploring and charting the coast line
and the Coronation gulf region, far
east of the mouth of the Mackenzie
river.
All of the party which left here on
the Alaska in July, 1913, returned ex

The last member of the party to see
Stefansson was the photographer Wll

parted from the ill fated Karluk
shortly before that vessel was carried
away in the grip of the northern ice
in the fall of 1913 and later crushed
near Herald islands. Wilkins was
with Stefansson last winter. Then he
made the trip over the ice to Corona

Mr. Wilkins learned from Stefans

PRESIDENTS TO LEAVE.
New York, Aug. 17.—The railroad
presidents of the country accepted
President Wilson's Invitation to con
fer in Washington. A number will
leave here for Washington this aft
ernoon, another delegation leaving
from Chicago.
Washington, May 17.—President
Wilson today invited the president!
of the principal railroads in the coun
try to come to Washington immedi
ately to confer with him on the
threatened railroad strike. Pending
their arrival, he does not plan to see
the committee of managers here, with
whom he has been meeting. The
president sent the following to the
leading railroad presidents:
"The discussion of matters involved
in the threatened strike has reached
a point which makes it highly desir
able that I should personally confer
with you at the earliest possible mo
ment and with the presidents of. any
•other railways affected, who may be
immediately accessible.
"I hope you can make lt 'convenl-"
ent to come to Washington Immedi
ately."
The president's action in asking a
conference with the railroad presi
dents themselves is interpreted as
meaning that the managers' commit
tee refused finally to concede the
eight-hour day as the president's plan
proposed, and the question now will
be up with the heads of the railroads
themselves If President Wilson finds
any railroad presidents who cannot
speak authoritatively for their roads,
he may invite to the White House the
financiers who control the roads. Of
ficials said the president wants to deal
with ultimate authority on both sides,
in order that negotiations may be
conducted here.
The situation as it stood today was:
The railroads flatly refuse to con
cede the eight-hour day. but are will
ing to arbitrate the question and all
others before any tribunal the presi
dent or the men may decide upon.
The men are willing to arbitrate
some of the questions under certain
conditions and are willing to arbitrate
others.
Late this afternoon the president
will present his plan to the full com
mittee of 640 employes, in the hope
of getting their approval. The re
sult will be presented the railroad
presidents later.
Early today, Secretary Tumulty
telephoned Daniel willard, president
of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad,
regarding the invitation to the rail
road presidents. Willard responded
that he would do everything possible
to arrange the conference.
Some of the leaders of the men are
planning to meet the demand of the
railroad managers for arbitration by
insisting to President Wilson that 75
more lines, for which the railroad
managers contend they have no au
thority to speak, shall be included In
the negotiations. Thus an old dis
pute between the managers and broth
erhood officials will be opened, prob
ably resulting in an inquiry into the
ownership and control of the 76 roads
In question. The investigation will
prove the employes' representatives
insist that it is the larger railroads
for which the managers are acting,
and that they control the majority of
the smaller lines.
