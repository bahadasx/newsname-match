INCREASING TO AN

Hog cholera is sweeping over Ma

valent in the northern part. R. W.
Blacklock, county demonstration
agent, says that the disease is in
creasing to an alarming extent, and
the situation is the more serious be
cause of the fact that the free serum
supply has been cut off. ' The farm
ers are, urged to look -to the sanitation
of their farms, to guard their hogs
against infection. It is - now neces

Wilson Has Invited Presidents of All
the Leading Railroads to Meet
Him in Washington
(Associated Press)
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today invited the presidents of
all the leading railroads to come to
Washington immediately to confer
with him regarding the threatened
strike. The invitation is taken to mean
the railroad managers committee re
fused finally to concede the eight
hour day the president proposed and
he wishes to put it up to' the railroad
heads. .
A FLAT REFUSAL
The situation is understood to be
that the railroads flatly refuse to
concede the eight-hour day, but are
willing to arbitrate that and all other
matters. The men are willing to ar
bitrate some questions, but unwilling
to arbitrate others. -
Among the railroad managers com
mittee it was said the railroad presi
dents were being constantly advised
as to the progress of negotiations and
it was thought they took the same
position the managers did. It was said
in case some railroad presidents can't
speak absolutely for their railroads,
the president may invite the. financi
ers controlling the roads.
The statement is also made that the
brotherhoods may try to bring - out
through the new turn of negotiations
their cdaim ; that the larger railroads
actually control many smaller ones.
-INVITATION ACCEPTED
New York, Aug. 17. The railroad
presidents have accepted President
Wilson's invitation to join him in con
ference at Washington, and many will
reac hthe capital tomorrow. -
STURKIE MAKES A STATEMENT
Says- He is Against Catts and that
Knott Spoke Too Soon
- (Tampa Times). 4 .
Mr. Sturkie was in the city this
morning on his way to Bradentown
where he is to try a law case this aft
ernoon. He called the Times office on
the telephone' to ask if the -Times had
deen the statement from Knott print
ed in the Times-Union yesterday. The
Times -had a copy of the statement
and asked Mr. Sturkie his opinion of
the charges made. -
"It is one of the meanest and most
contemptible things I have ever
seen," -said he. "I can't conceive of
any reason why Knott should do such
an idiotic thing.
"I am a Knott man, always have
been a Knott man and shall vote for
him, for governor, even in spite of this,
for I wouldn't vote for that old hypo
crite Catts for anything. But why
should he accuse me of being a traitor
to him? I have worked for him, spent
my money for him, gone into law
suits for him and done everything
possible for one, man to do for an
other in a political way.
"As to the charges he mades, there
isn't a thing in the world to them. I
have never been for Catts and don't
expect to "be."
v"How did Knott . get the idea ' fhat
you were hostile to him ?"Mr. Sturkie
was asked. . i
"I can't imagine, unless it was be
cause of a little joke statement I
made before a newspaper man : in
Jacksonville the other day," he re
plied. "He asked me what I thought
of the situation and I said in a joking
way, 'Oh, I guess old Catts was elect
ed all right.'
"At the same time I winked to
some others who were standing with
me and 'I never thought the reporter
took me seriously. If I had I should
have corrected the impression."
Knott Needs His Friends
Mr. Sturkie was energetic in his
condemnation of Knott for making
glblic such a statement without con
sultation with ihm to see if the con
clusions Knott had reached were cor
rect. ' . " -' ' - - : 7 '
"Knott is in no position to lose any
of his friends," said Sturkie. He
ought to be a bit more careful about
how he alienates them with fool
things of this sort."
He made it very clear, however,
that he was for Knott and not for
reason or under any consideration for
Catts.
"I've ibeen fighting that bunch of
hypocrites all the way through this
campaign' said he. "And I couldn't
be for Catts if I wanted to."

CATTS IS KATZ
, (Orlando Reporter-Star)
S. J. Catts in his speech to the citi

German descent, stated that his fam
ily came' from Germany; that the
German form of his name was. Katz;
that he believed in the cause of the
Germans in the present war and
hoped they would win against the en
tente allies. All of this might have
been stated in truth and sincerity, but
it has the seeming of sham and pre
tense. It was intended solely to cap
ture the vote of the Gotha precinct,
but we are greatly mistaken in our
appraisal of those sturdy and sensi

such shallow platitudes.

ELECTRIC Wm
S UNPOPULAR
Third Attempt Made to Destroy the
Plant on the River Above
Tampa
(Associated Press)
Tampa, Aug. 17. A number of
masked men unsuccessfully attempt
ed to burn the power olant of tlie
Tampa Electric company near here
early today after binding the em
ployes and cutting the' telephone
wires, according to information the
police have received. One -of the era-
ioyes at the plant extinguished the
ames before much damage had been
done. There have been no arrests.
The plant was twice destroyed before.
The police think the attempt was
made to destroy the plant because
water from the dam floods the nearby
farm lands.
SOME OTHER REASON
General Manager Wroodsome of the
electric company said he didn't think
endangered farm lands caused the at
tempt to wreck the plant because the
company previously offered to buy
such lands, and the men didn't at
tempt to wreck the dam.
