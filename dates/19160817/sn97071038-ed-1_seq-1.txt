Famous Highway Is Not Receiving
Recognition It Deserves Is Opin
ion of Heppner Business Men.
Effort to be Made to Direct
Travel This Way.
The Blue Trail, the best route of
the National Highway through this
section of Eastern Oregon has been
passed up by the general traveling
public, that great body of auto tour
tats and so far as Heppner is con
cerned, very little of the main travel
has come this way.
The chief reason advanced for this
is that the lower or Echo route is a
few miles shorter. Secondly, bad re
ports have gone out concerning the
condition of the Heppner-Pllot Rock
road. There , can be no doubt
that part of the report was true. Ev
ery one acknowledges, who has been
over thn route, that the Hog Hollow
road is in a poor condition. This is
a case of hard luck more than any
thing else for early in the year con
siderable work was expended in put
ting that part of the road in good
shape. Later the washouts occurred
and since then no doubt Hog Hollow
has presented a sorry appearance.
On the other hand, since the dry
weather arrived, the Echo road in the
lower Butter creek section has be
come badly cut up. As a consequence
the past few weeks have seen a big
Increase in travel over the upper
route. Many people contend that the
upper route is better any time than
the lower. We know it to be a fact in
the winter time.
Recently many Blue Trail signs
have been prepared with a view of
better directing travel over this route.
Some of the local business men have
outlined a trip which will extend as
far East as La Grande and as far
WeBt as Wasco. At this time they
will thoroughly inspect the Blue
Trail, learn more of its good and bad
points and be better prepared to ex
ploit this highway for tourist travel.
YOUNG MAN LOSES
LIFE IN ROCK GREEK
Ralph Lauder, age 22, lost his life
in Rock creek five miles above Olex
last Sunday evening about 4 o'clock.
Young Lauder had gone in swimming
and while diving was caught in some
wire on the bottom of the creek, and
drowning was the result. The body
was recovered bIx hours later by a
searching party.
Ralph Lauder graduated from the
University of Oregon with the class of
1915. Since graduation he has been
living on his 400 acre farm and an
additional homestead he had taken
up Joining his land. His parents live
in Moscow, Idaho.
A corner's inquest was held, and
M. L. Case was called from Heppner
to Arlington, where he prepared the
body for shipment to Moscow, where
the funeral will be held.
Will Return to Morrow County.
Joe Devine was a passenger out
from Lexington Tuesday, going to his
home near Portland where he has
been living for a numbr of years. Mr.
Devine has been up this way for sev
eral weeks completing arrangements
to return to Morrow county and take
charge of his farm northeast of Lex
ington. He reports that Mrs. Devine
lias entirely recovered her health and
it was on this account that he decided
to leave here when he did. He states
that he is mighty glad that he can
get back here again, and we are sure
that his coming will be welcomed as
lie was one of our very best citizens.
Hon. T. J. Mahoney was a passen
ger for Portland Tuesday morning,
being called to that city on business.
We presume he would also take In the
elg Hughes meeting while in the me
tropolis and get a chance to shake the
hand of the republican nominee.
Mr. and Mrs. Eph Eskelson and
daughter left on Tuesday for Port
land and will spend a few weeks of
an outing at the coast. Mr. Eskelson
has finished his harvest and the fam
ily will take this vacation before the
Fall work commences.
Mrs. E. D. Brown departed for
Portland Tuesday where she will meet
her sister and then go on to the coast
at Tillamook for a short stay. Mr.
Brown is absent in the Alberta coun
try where he will remain until about
September 1st.
Ralph Johnson of the City Meat
Market, made a business trip to. Port
land the last of the week.
BARLEY MAKES YIELD
OF 52 BU. PER ACRE
Fall-sown beardeu barley on the
Rhea creek ranch of Jeff Jones has
made a yield of 52 bushels per acre
Mr. Jones is following the system
this year of heading and threshing
together, the grain being hauled from
the header to the separator. Sixty
acres of barley which Mr. Jones has
just completed harvesting, produced
1217 sacks and weighed 123 pounds
to the sack.
Mr. Jones and his sons, Glenn and
Alva have about 500 acres of wheat
to head and thresh and it is estimat
ed that the wheat will yield on an av
erage of 25 bushels per acre.
L
BE
Each side in the big railroad con
troversy, which has caused a threat
ening cloud to hang over the indus
trial horizon of the country for many
weeks, has agreed to submit proposi
tions to the other.
The conference which has been
carried on the past few days before
President Wilson has not yet result
ed In anything definite. The railroads
are said to be willing to submit to
the eight-hour day asked for by the
brotherhoods but it is the overtime
proposition which they fear most to
meet. According to the statement
of railroad officials there is scarcely
a freight run In the entire country
which could cover a run In 8 hours.
Thus the "time and a half" which
they would be forced to meet would
run into the millions of dollars.
It is understood that the two sides
are now nearer to a settlement than
at any previous time.
New Apartments.
The Heppner Milling Company will
have nice apartments In the second
story of their building after J. H. Cox
has completed the work of recon
struction which Is now In process.
The apartments will be nicely fur
nished and modern in every particu
lar. Mrs. John Portwood of Condon was
severely burned about the face last
Sunday when an oil stove over which
she was cooking, exploded. Accord
ing to reports received In this city,
Mrs. Portwood lost considerable hair
when the Are reached her head and
face. Her condition is not serious.

DEPUTY SHERIFF KILLS
FIRST DEER OF SEASON
Deputy Sheriff Willard Herren kill
ed the first deer of the season, accord
ing to game warden Robert Young.
Mr. Hrren got a big buck and sent
one of the hind quarters down to
George McDuffee.
Mr. Herren left Heppner Sunday
evening in company with Oscar Borg,
H. H. Hoffman and Loy M. Turner.
Deer are numerous in the mountains
this year, say those who have been
scouting the high hills and it is sate
to presume that several of our best
hunters will probably get the limit
this year.
Rowing Party.

INS
Egg City Is Scene of Harvest Activity,
Other Items of Interest.
All arrangements have been com
pleted for the putting in of a new sid
ing at the C. R. Johnson place on the
creek below lone. The Wilson Sid
ing Grain & Elevator Co. has been or
ganized for the purpose of handling
grain at that point, and will at once
begin the construction of a platform
to care for the grain that will be
hauled there this season. The siding
will be put in immediately by the rail
road company, and next year the new
grain company will put up an eleva
tor; this is the plan in mind at the
present and no doubt will be carried
out. Some 50,000 sacks of grain will
be shipped from this platform this
season according to present estimates,
and this may be increased as the loca
tion makes it very convenient for a
large number of farmers in getting
their grain to market. C. R. Johnson
is the president of the new company
and J. T. Knappenberg is secretary
treasurer. These two gentlemen with
F. H. Wilson, W. T. McNabb and S. P.
Wilson make the board of directors.
W. F. Palmateer, of Morgan, is
sure some jitney driver, but he has a
hard time making the blamed thing
stay on the grade. It would not stay
in the road, so he let is go over the
embankment just below his place, the
result being that the repairs made by
the garage man cost him around forty
dollars. This was the first time h4
had tried to drive the "critter" and
he is sure that it acts worse than a
contrary mule. Having a half inter
est in the machine he feels that he
surely got his money's worth on this
maiden trip and he may decide to
take a lesson or two before he goes
out alone again.
Some damage resulted to the cars
of E. F. Day and French Burroughs
in a collision a few days ago. Mr.
Day drives a Franklin and Mr. Bur
roughs has a Ford, and the lighter
machine was the most seriously dam
aged. The collision occured at the
point where the road comes out from
the Ike Howard place and joins the
public highway. The tall grass shut
out the vision. Mr. Burroughs was
compelled to put a new fender and
running board on his car, and one
wheel was somewhat damaged on the
Day car. No Injury to occupants re
sulted. Charley Read, who with his son,
Gus, Is farming a large tract of land
ust north of lone, Is now in the midst
of his threshing with the combine,
and reports a yield of blue stem of 30
bushels to the acre. Mr. Read states
that the field he is in now is his best
wheat but he expects a good yield
from the balance. Charley contract
ed a thousand sacks of this blue stem
at $1.12, which is the top price paid
so far on the lone market. We un
derstand that W. G. Palmateer, of
Morgan, beat this price Just a half
cent.
Irvin Wllks, who has charge of the
hauling of the barley crop from the
Baker place, returned from a trip to
Pendleton Monday. Mr. Wilks has
several of his teams here and the
grain is being rapidly moved into the
warehouse. He is a contractor on
roads and street work at Pendleton.
He was joined by Mrs. Wllks who ar
rived from Pendleton Tuesday after
noon.
Ray Bonlne came down from Hepp
ner the first of the week to fix up a
Rumley tractor for use in the harvest
fields. The machine will be usd by A.
M. Zink to run his thrshing ma
chine purchased this week from W.
F. Palmateer of Morgan. This will
give one more machine on the north
side and will help the people out that
way in getting their grain in the sack.
A. C. Ruby, Importer of blooded
horses, came up from his Gresham
home Monday. Mr. Ruby owns a large
wheat ranch near lone, and he is also
engaged at the present time in buying
horses and mules on a governmeut
contract. He is assisted In the work
here by W. N. James who has been
in this section for the past ten days.
Algott W. Lundell, prosperous
young farmer of Gooseberry, this
week purchased a fine player piano
from C. Guy Wakefield. As part pay
ment on tO instrument, Mr. Lundell
turned in a Cadillac car which Mr.
Wakefield will convert into a truck
or the purpose of delivering pianos.

NEW
FOR I0NE FARMERS
NEW LOAN BILL DIS
E
August 22 Is Day get On Which Her
bert Myrick Will Speak.
Spokane, Wash., August 15. To
discuss means of securing for the In
land Empire the greatest possible
benefit from the new federal farm
loan system, a special meeting of far
mers, bankers and business men of
all lines will be held in Spokane Tues
day, August 22.
The principal speaker will be Her
bert Myrick, president and editor-in-chief
of the Orange-Judd agricultural
publications, who ha agreed to come
to Spokane at the solicitation of the
Inland Empire Development league
and Spokane Chamber of Commerce,
acocrding to M. E. Hay, president of
the former organization.
"Mr. Myrick was one of the origin
ators of the federal loan system,"
states Mr. Hay. "He was present by
pecial invitation when President Wil
son signed the bill on July 17. For
some time he has been addressing
nass conventions in th soeuth relative
to the plan.
"Inasmuch as this new system
promises to be of vital importance to
the agricultural development of the
Inland Empire, I think it wise that
our farmers, bankers and business
men become thoroughly familiar with
it. Mr. Myrick has agreed to explain
the entire subject, and tell how it is
possible to reap the fullest benefits
through cooperation between the va
rious chambers of commerce and the
farmers. I
"We are extending an open invita
tion to the people of the Inland Em
pire to hear Mr. Myrick at the Spo
kane Chamber of Commerce Tuesday
nooS)! August 22." - . .
"A Law Unto Himself" Features
Crane Wilbur at Star Next Sunday.
Crane Wilbur, that popular roman
tic star who has appeared to Buch
good advantage before Heppner au
diences on former occasions, will be
seen in David Horseley's great five-
act production, "A Law Unto Him-
Crane Wilbur, Star In the Horiley
Mutual Motarpictur.. D Luxt Edi
tion, self" at the Star theatre Sunday.
The Sunday features have been
causing comment among theatre-go
ers in this city. They are pictures of
high class. That play, "The Oval
Diamond" shown here last Sunday
was replete with mystery and filled
with interest. These features come
up to all promises made for them and
are meritorious of the full houses
which greet them.
, Cupid Is Out Done.
Cupid can feel that it was a case
of his labors lost in the case of Henry
Bode and his wife, Arminda Sayles
Bode. The nuptial knot was tied
only a little more than a week ago
and now Mrs. Bode has decided the
short courtship and hasty marriage
was a piece of hastiness on the part
of Dan Cupid, or at least this Is pro
bably her own conclusion. At any
rate Mrs. Bode packed up all her be
longings and returned to her former
home this week. Mr. Bode, for so
young a groom, does not feel at all
disconsolate, but feels that It is pro
bably better as it is. He has strong
hopes for the future.
CDNINSPOKl
FORD DEMAND GREAT
ER THAN THE SUPPLY
That the demand for Ford cars Is
too great for the supply is the sub
stance of a statement made by Chas.
Vaughn of Vaughn & Sons, local Ford
agents. Mr. Vaughn states they have
orders for Fords now that they are
unable to Jill Bimply because they are
unable to get the cars here at this
time.
The present shortage it attributed
to the $80 reduction in price recently
made by the Ford company. This re
duction has served to greatly increase
sales and the distributing agencies
have run short of cars as a conse
quence. ,E.
Chas. E. Hughes, republican nom
nee for president of the United States
has launched his campaign on the
Pacific Coast after making three
speeches per day in the cities of Seat
tle, Tacoma and Spokane respective
ly. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes are
passing through the state of Oregon
on their way to San Francisco.
Portland was host to M. ana Mrs.
Hughes yesterday and since Portland
is the only city in Oregon Included
In Jflr. Hughes' western itinery, Port
land acted as host for the entirt state
as well.
In speaking of Mr. Hughes' appear
ance in Spokane, the Spokesman-Re
view has the following to say:
An arraignment of the anti-dump
ing clause of the democratic revenue
bill was a feature of the candidate's
speech in the Spokane stadium, The
theory that Mr. Hughes lacked humor
was disproved as thoroughly as the
theory that icicles cling to his whisk
ers by -the. time, th audience, had.
aughed for a full minute at his shafts
of ridicule, directed against this
measure.
At both the Coeur d'Alene and sta
dium meetings Mr. Hughes talked
principally protection and the Mex
ican Question. He made his first ref
erence to Colonel Roosevelt at the
stadium when he spoke of President
Wilson's early statement that there
was no need for special attention to
national defense, and added:
"Then there came a great leader
who went through this country stat
ing the contrary, and overnight opin
ion in Washington changed under the
1 pressure of that leadership."
I The audience greeted this refer
'nce with strong applause.
Regular and progressive elements
i of the republican party joined in har
: mony in the reception to Mr. Hughes.
Such representatives of diverse views
as Senator Miles Poiudexter and Na
tional Committeemen S. A. Perkins
rode in a car with Mr. Hughes in the
parade of downtown streets and on
the platform at the stadium speech
virtually all former Spokane progres
sives who have had part in the local
organization were represented.
Probably 10,000 people greeted
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes as they covered
the down town parade route yester
day morning. The trip to Coeur d'
Alene followed, wtere Mr. Hughes
addressed 4500 people for an hour.
Upon his return to Spokane he ad
dressed a capacity audience of 2000
women voters at the Auditorium, hun
dreds being turned away for the lack
of space The reception at the Dav
enport hotel followed, and then the
stadium speech.
By making arrangements for a spe
cial train out of Spokane last night
Mr. Hughes was able to devote more
time to Spokane people at the stad
ium than other wl3e would have been
possible.
Mr. Hughes speaks at Tacoma and
Seattle today and Portland Wednes
day. He was accompanied to the
Coast last night by Millard T. Hart-
son of Tacoma, repuoucan state
chairman.
Social and political barriers, which
some supposed would limit the num
ber to shake the hand of Charles
Evans Hughes and Mrs. Hughes at
the reception at the Davenport hotel
yesterday afternoon, were entirely ig
nored when the committee saw the
immense crowd that jammed the lob
by and the entrances to the hotel, as
well as lining the sidewalks to the
curbs. In 30 minutes, as a result,
policemen on the door estimated that
3000 people had shaken hands with
the republican candidate for the pres
idency and his wife.
A large crowd was at the Northern
Pacific depot when the train depart
ed for the Coast at 9:45.
L
DCALWHEATSELLS
FOR $1.12 1-2 PER
Morrow County Farmers Are Slow to
Contract, Thereby Indicating
They Wil Hold For High,
er Prices.
Top prices were paid for wheat in
Heppner last week but comparatively
few sold. In fact the local market
was stronger than it was in neighbor
ing counties. While $1.12 was be
ing offered here, $1.08 was the high
est paid in Sherman county.
Very Httle of the 1916 crop has yet
been sold by the contract method in
Heppner, although a large number in
the lone country have contracted a
part of their crop. None of it has yat
been bought for less than a dollar per
bushel. .
Those who sold here last week at
$1.12 were Harvey Young and Jess
Coats of Eight Mile. They each sold
1000 sacks at that price.
During the present week the mar
ket has been off a little and no wheat
has been sold in Heppner. Present in
dications are for a stronger market
and in a few days buying will proba
bly be resumed with vim. Today's
quotation in Heppner on bluestem is
$1.06.
Ayers-Builer.
Wm. Ayers, janitor at the court
house, and Ella Butler, his house
keeper, were married at the groom's
home in this city Wednesday evening.
County Judge C. C. Patterson per
formed the ceremony. Later in the
evening Mr. and Mrs. Ayers wer
given a hearty shivaree by their many
friends. We extend congratulations.
Dr. D. R. Haylor went to Portland
this morning on a brief business trip.
Mrs. Haylor and son, who have been
visiting in the metropolis for several
weeks, will return home with him.
GREETS
JOLLY EURS
"Daddy" Draper and his Jolly En
tertainers have been to town and ev
eryone who attended their shows, if
shows they might be called, are much
happier and have been strengthened
in their belief that this old world is
not all bad after all. This bunch
surely deserve the title of Jolly En
tertainers for their power to both en
tertain and amuse is almost unlimit
ed. In telling of his home at Des
Moines, Wash., Mr. Draper said that
he and Mrs. Draper have adopted
many of the children they have un
der their care and have gathered the
little folks around them in a happy
family. Each child is learning some
hing useful and the home is made en
tirely self-supporting through their
efforts. Every summer they tour the
country presenting their entertain
ments and everywhere they meet with
the best success. In a musical way
the children are surprising and they
more than deserved the many words
of praise which local people have giv
en them. Their appearance on the
stage almost makes one forget they
are only children, so easily do they
perform.
The children made many friends
while in town, and all of them were
Invited to partake of the hospitality
of our people.
Mr. Draper has the sincere thanks
of this community for bringing his
troupe here and we all wish him to
return.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
People of Morrow county who
want concessions at the Morrow
County Fair should make their choice
of location at once as outside con
cessionaires are asking for space
daily, and it is the desire of the
Board to give home people first choice
where possible.
