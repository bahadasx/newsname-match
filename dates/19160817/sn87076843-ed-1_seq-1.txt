Sessions Growing1 More Mild as
Weather Grows Cooler.
The session of the village Chau
tauqua at the council rooms last
Wednesday furnished entertain
ment for a fair sized audience. -
When his Honor, Mayor Raither,
mounted the throne and cast an in
specting eye upon his surroundings
lie discovered all six of the faith
ful servants of the people assem
bled in their respective stations,
and in his mind s eye he could ob
serve a few well sharpened stil
lettos whose thrusts he might an
ticipate, and he marvelled at the
sadness of official life, its multi
tudinous duties, its scarcity of
laurels and its wonderful lack of
appreciative praise. However,
there was one joy left for him Hie1
faithful clerk was close at hand.
The minutes of the previous
meeting were approved in part
that section which referred to the
mayor's decision on the vote cast
in favor of locating the sidewalk
line on Locust street 14 feet from
property line being omitted.
A catch basin with the necessary
tile was ordered at 5th and Locust
streets.
The resolution establishing a
general sidewalk line at four feet
from property line was given its
second reading and will come up
for its third reading at the next
meeting This red tape perform
ance is made necessary because of
the impossibility of securing
enough votes in council to suspend
the rules. The resolution is that
which is em odied in the initiative
petition which is now in the hands
of council, asking for a referendum
vote on the resolution.
Of course no man can correctly
anticipate the ways of Providence,
the verdict of a petit jury, or the
possible acts of a village council,
but it is a fairly good bet that this
resolution will be placed in the dis
card at the next meeting and thus
leave the matter up to the votes of
the people at the next election as
to whether or not there shall be a
regularly established sidewalk line
for the village, or hit and miss,
goose-path line of walks, laid out
according to the desire of each in.
dividual property owner.
There was much oratory at this
session of a more or less interest
ing nature, and all efforts to con
fuse his Honor were met with an
Uncle Joe Cannon calm and firm
ness that defied all efforts to con
fuse him

Just the Thing for Diarrhoea.
"About two years ago I had a se
vere attack of diarrhoea which lasted
over a week," writes W. C. Jones, Bu
ford, N. D. "I became so weak that I
could not stand upright. A druggist
recommended Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. The
first dose relieved mo and within two
days I was as well as over." Many
druggists recommend this remedy be
cause they know that it is reliable. Ob
tainable everywhere.
