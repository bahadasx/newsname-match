MOOSE LEADER WILL
AID PRES. WILSON
Acting Chairman Hale Says Re
publicans Are Reactionary
Matthew Hale, acting chair
man of the Progressive national
committee* has issiied the fol
lowing statement:
"The need for a Progressive
party is as great now as it wad
four years ago. Its possibilities
are even greater.
"If some of our leaders had
dot been more eager ,in their
•enthusiasm against President
Wilson than in their enthusiasm
for Pregressive principles the
party would have been preserved
in its entiety.
"Those leaders of the Pro
gressive party who do not 'sec
red' when the president's name
is mentioned realize fully thai
the Progressive party of the past
four years has suffered frightful
in.juy at the hands of its own
loaders but they believe that it
can render service in 'this comin
catnpaign by nutting up Progres
sive electors in a few critical
states, and that it can be mad"
the 7iue.l«ms of a broaiVr anil
more democratic Progrc»
party in the future. For this
reason they are willing io tight.
MAKE UP OWN MINDS
"In the meantime. Progressive
except in the few states where
Progressiva electors are put in
the fieMymust vote for the can
didate of another party in the
coming campaign. Progressive
are going to make up then- own
minds in this matter. They are
not going to be delivered by any
leader or group of leaders to any
presidential candidate. They ar"
going to resent any attempt In
make such delivery, ••specially by
methods that vl" aie one of the
fundamental principles of I he
Progressive parly and the riglii
to the rank and lile ul' the partv
and not a group of leaders to
nominate the parly candidates.
"Personally, 1 shall support
the Progressive electors in these
few stales in which they will b"
placed up"ii I lie ha'loi. Else
where 1 »hall do all thai I can I
help re-elect President Wilson.
STATES REASONS
"My reasons for doing so are
twofold. He has aetua'lv put in
to effect more progressive legi-d.i
lion than any oilier president we
have everhad. I need only cit"
the federal income tax, the new
currency law: parcel post direct
election of United States sena
•lors, the rural credit act and the
federal employment bureau.
"His persistent advocacy of I lie
national child labor law shows
that he is as eager as ever to
continue tliis^ legislative record.
He has shown great sympathy for
the whole Progressive movement
and he has shown an ability lo
secure co-operation of his party
in putting his progressive ideas
into actual legislation.
"Mr. Hughes', on the other
hand does not impress one as •_
ing in real sympathy with tie
underlying economic ideals of
Ihe Progressive party. His
speeches sound like ordinary Rc_
publican stump speeches, palling
the laborer on their back with
vague phrases and congratulat
ing the employers for their wel
fare work. He is honest but
Progressivism means more than
that.
"REPUBLICANS REACTIONARY"
"Moreover. Mr. Hughes has Ihe
Republican party to deal with-—a
party exactly as reactionary as it
was in I!'12. He needs the sup
port A)f George W. Perkins his
speeches reflect, his need. There
fore. I see no hope whatever of
securing- any real progressive leg
islation under the leadership of
Mr. Hughes and the Republican
party.
"As between President Wilson
and a man of Col. Roosevelt's un
ique experience and unrivaled
skill in international affairs. I
advocated Col.Roosevelt's election
unhesitatingly. But Mr. Hughes
is Col Roosevelt neither i*.i ex
perience nor in temperament. He
would enter upon one of the most
difficult international situations
we have ever faced as an absolut
ely raw recruit, an untried man.
UNFAMILIAR WITH PROBLEMS
"His unfamiliarity with th-r
problems with which he will be
faced is shown conclusively by
vague manner in which he deals
with these problems in his speech
es. The speeches are filled with
denunciations but contain no
word of constructive statesman
ship in regard to our foreign pol
icy. Mr. Hughes is vagtie on
these questions, not only he
cause he do"s not know* what he
would have done or what he would
now do. but also because in order

Millard R. Meyers. Managaing
Editor of the American Co-Oper
ative Journal, the mouthpiece of
the Chicago Board of Trade, was
a pleasant caller at the Exchange
office's last. week. Mr. Meyers
like every other shrewd observer
of the pesent trend of events, is
beginning to realize that the
farmers are going to market their
grain co-operatively, not only al
the local market but at the ter
minal as well. Mr. Meyers may
not admit this fact, but the up
rising among the grain growers
of the country is so general that
anyone interested in Ihe grain
business can see that the ter
minal co-operative marketing ol
grain is very dose at hand.
