Lansing Acknowledges That
Lusitania Business Was All
"Balled Up" By Watch
ful Waiting Policy
Washington. State department of
ficials today explained that the recent
request to the German embassy for
permission to publish one of Count
von Bernstorff's notes on the settle
ment of the Lusitania case, was an
inadvertance. At first it was denied
that any such request had been made
but an investigation of the depart
ment's files disclosed that a letter pre
pared by a subordinate official had
been signed either by Secretary Lan
sing or Acting Secretary Polk and had
been transmitted to the German em
bassy. State department officials declared
that too much importance had been
attached to the request in German of
ficial quarters and that it was not, as
interpreted, an' indication that Ger
many's proposals were to be accept
ed as satisfactory.
State department officials today
broke their silence on the subject and
asserted that what really happened
was this:
How it Happened
A subordinate official who assembles
the diplomatic correspondence, wrote
the German embassy a letter, which
Mr. Polk admitted was signed either
by himself or by Secretary Lansing,
for permission to publish one of the
Lusitania notes submitted by the Ger
man ambassador on December 4. The
embassv replied giving its assent
with the suggestion that the last note,
dated February 16, be published at
the same time, This suggestion was
not answered. On the other hand, the
suggestion that any of the correspon
donee be published was dropped at
once on the decision of tiigher officials
that the circumstances which inter
vened to prevent a conclusion of the
negotiations had not been altered,
The embassy was not informed of
the changed plan. Word was sent to
Berlin that the note would be made
public here.
When information was received
here of the request to the embassy
and its reply, German embassy offic
ials were questioned and they led in'
quirers to believe they considered the
proceeding an indication of the im
pending acceptance of the latest Ger
man proposals. In fact it was stated
that the diplomatic relations between
the United States and Germany never
had been so satisfactory from their
point of view since they were first
imperilled by submarine warfare.
Intimations Unauthorized
This was supplemented further by
characterizing as absolutely unwar
ranted recent intimations from Ber
lin that underseas warfare was about
to be ltsumed on its former scale
There was the added impression that
the United States had been convinced
by the abandonment of the submarine
campaign since the sinking of the
channel liner Sussex, of the sincerity
of Germany's declaration of accept
ance of the principles laid down, Up
on that showing they believed the
state department was about to pub
lish the Lusitania correspondents with
an implication, at least, of its accept
ability.
This view of the situation was laid
before Acting Secretary Polk Wednes
day as having been gained in German
official circles. Mr. Polk's reply was
a refusal even to discuss the Lusitania
case.
The United States government, it
therefore appears, does not consider
the matter settled in any sense any
more than it was last February.
A FALSEHOOD OVERTAKEN
"Certain newspapers -in Union coun
ty, to-wit: the Des Moines Swastika
and Clayton News, last week publish
ed articles regarding the case of
State vs. Dewey Johnson imputing to
the District Attorney's office a refusal
or neglect to perform its duty and
making it necessary for Judge Leib
to appoint a special prosecutor in the
case.
Mr. Johnson was on the
day of 1916 arrested
and taken before L. W. Kingdom,
Justice of the Peace in Clayton Pre
cinct and after an investigation was
bound over to await the action of the
Grand Jury of Union county on a
homicide charge under a bond of
$3000.00. Immediately on learning of
the case Mr. Remley went into the
facts with SheriiT Crumley and Jus
tice Kingdom and concluded the of
fense under the facts was bailable
and that the bond fixed by Justice
Kingdom and Sheriff Crumley was
reasonable and just under the facts.
On Saturday July 29th, 1916, Judge
Lieb requested the undersigned to
file an information against Johnson
saying it did not look good to the
people to see Johnson running at large.
The undersigned took it up with Mr.
Remley who said he had made an in
vestigation and decided Justice King
dom had properly admitted Johnson to
bail and the Districts Attorney's office
then notified Judge Lieb that under
all the facts it still considered the of
fense bailable and the bond sufficient
to insure his appearance before the
Grand Jury and as Johnson was al
ready bound over to the Grand Jury
there was no necessity of a further
hearing in the matter.
During the absence of Mr. Remley
on a business trip to the State of Iowa
where he still is detained and while
the undersigned was on a vacation
trip and seventy miles from his office,
to-wit: on August 12, Judge Lieb had
Johnson rearrested and held an inves
tigation and he admitted him to bail
in the sum of $15,000 and the People
still see Johnson running at large.
Johnson has now given four bonds
since he was charged with the offense.
Why Johnson's case should demand
any different procedure than other
cases of similar character or why the
Judge should appoint Johnson's bit
ter personal enemy special prosecutor
the District Attorney's Office cannot
understand. We will prosecute Mr.
Johnson just as we have every other
man charged with crime in this Dis-
trict, fearlessly and to the full ex
tent of our ability. We deem it our
duty to see that Justice is meeted out
equally and see that every man, no
matter what are his political or other
affiliations, is treated fairly and im
partially. It is not the duty of the Dis
trict Attorney's Office to persecute
any man and so long as the present
incumbents are in office ALL PER
SONS will be treated alike and when
charged with crime, without the aid
of any prosecutor appointed by the
Court, fully and fairly prosecuted, but
no man shall be hy us persecuted.
Neither Mr. Remley nor the under
signed made any statement or did any
act that indicated we would not pros
ecute Mr. Johnson or said any thing
that could be so construed. The ar
ticles published in the above mention
ed newspapers making imputations
against our office were absolutely
false.
Signed:
O. L. PHILLIPS,
Assistant District Attorney.
THE PAPER CRISIS
The eight leading Philadelphia
newspapers have entered an agree
ment to cut the size of their papers
on September first to eighty pages
each week, or less than twelve pages
daily. Returns from newsdealers have
been suspended and other drastic tops
agreed upon to try to meet a print
paper shortage that threatens the
whole great newspaper industry of
the United States. Very little paper
3 to be had now and very soon there
will be less. Such as is to be had
where newspapers are unprotected by
rontracts is at prices which prohibit
publication at present newspaper
rates for sales and advertising space
The Union County Fair will be held
on September 19-20-21-22. The pre
mium list will be about the same as
last year and will be out SOON. Get
your exhibits ready.

Corrompa, was here Monday morning
attending to business matters.

'Senator iaggarts speecu, maue in
connection with the proposed revenue,
was remarkable in many respects.
He chided his colleagues for their
extravagance, called for a more busi
ness-like administration of the gov
ernment affairs and took issue with
many congressmen, senators and the
president on the question of raising
revenue.
Taggart Reviews Legislation
Senator Taggart reviewed the legis
lation that has been passed since he
entered the senate, telling which he
approved and which he did not ap
prove. He declared definitely his opposi
tion to the rivers and harbors bill, por
tions of the agricultural bill and the
public buildings bill.
Finally, he devoted himself to an
attack on the way the revenue pro
vided in the administration revenue
bill is to be raised.
In the face of definite opposition by
the president to a bond issue, Senator
Taggart declared himself unqualified
ly for a budget system and a bond
issue.
Insists on Scrupulous Care
Taggart insisted public business
should be conducted with the same
scrupulous care as private business.
"I wonder," he asked, "what would
happen to each senator and each
member of the house If1 he spentor
appropriated money in his private af
fairs as he spends it in public affairs ?
I wonder how long it would be until
we would all find ourselves in bank
ruptcy ? On the other hand, I wonder
what would happen to the country if
every member of the senate and house
would make up his mind in the direc
tion of rigid ecenomy, and fearlessly
cut off every useless dollar of ap
propriations? I wonder if the tax
payers would rise up and revolt
against congress if such a thing
should happen? I favor a liberal but
businesslike economy."
speaKing ot constant increases in
taxation, Senator Taggart said:
"I believe the taxpayers of the na
tion would like to be given a rest
from having their taxes increased ev
ery year. These enormous increases
in appropriations and taxes cannot go
on forever. There must and will be
a clay of reckoning. The power to tax
means the power to destroy, and we
do not want to destroy the earning
power of the people by overtaxation-
Congress is getting into the habit of
casting about to find things on which
to place a tax, instead of vigilantly
seeking where it can economize with
out injury to the public service."
Emphatically Favors Budget
With respect to the responsibility
for extravagance, he said:
"The party in control holds the
purse strings of the treasury and it
should assume responsibility for dis
bursoments. If it fails to assume this
responsibility, it fails to do its duty."
Tairtrart declared unqualifiedly in
favor of a budget.
"The first thing congress does," he
continued, "is to determine how much
money it wants to appropriate and
it proceeds to make the appropriations
whether or not the revenues are suf
ficient to meet them.
"It seems to me that we should be
gin at the other end, and first sec
whether oiir revenues are sufficient to
meet ordinary demands. If the reve
nues are insufficient, then curtail and
cut off every useless appropriation.
Economy is itself a great revenue.
Once congress embarks upon this pol
icy there would be no conditions of
laying taxes as suggested in the pres
ent revenue bill.'
Refers to Building Bill
his attack on the public building
he said:
fhis bill takes care of 297 congres-
pl districts out of a total of 435,
it takes care of every state in the
n except Vermont. Under sec-
3, 1 have made a little tabulation.
section carries authorizations for
ojects. The populations in towns
b of these projects range from
to 3,000. The average popula-
in these towns is 1,980. The to-
uthorization carried for buildings
íese 39 projects is $1,125,000,
i means, when made, an average
opriation for each inhabitant of
e towns of $14.50."
in closing his speech he said:'
"Instead of squandering money in
catching cattle ticks, killing coyotes,
wild ducks, treating goats sufferng
wth Malta fever, sending out useless
garden and vegetable seeds, passing
pork barrel river and harbor bills,
pork barrel public building bills,
would it not be better to get down
to rigid bedrock ecenomy and save
the people from the never-ceasing
visits of the tax gatherer?"
REPUBLICAN PRECINCT CON
VENTION The Precinct Primary which was
called to meet at 2:00 p. m. last Sat
urday at the court house was obliged
to change its place of meeting to the
aPlmer Hall owing to the fact that
the distric court was holding an ex
tra session. Nearly one hundred Re
publicans met at the time set and the
most harmonious, enthusiastic pre
cinct convention ever held in Union
county took place, v
The meeting was called to order by
the precinct chairman, Mr. Carl Ek-
lund. Atty. C. A. Law was then chosen
chairman; H. H. Errett was chosen
secretary and Mr. Trancito Romero
was chosen interpreter. "
After a few short talks by various
members presentHhe convention pro
ceeded to nominate and elecf in a true
democratic manner "the eighteen dele
gates to the county convention ' to
which this prcinct is entitled. The fol
lowing were selected:
i'W. P. Graham, Frank Farrias, E.
W. Fox, H. J. Hammond Jr., Wm.
Mootz, H. H. Errett, R. M. Olbeter, L.
E. Gallegos, D W. Snyder, Hugh B.
Woodward, A. C. Osburn, Juan Car
rillo, R. Q. Palmer, J. W. Hanners,
Frank Hoover, Manuel Garcia, Juan
Gallegos, John Hill.
Alternate: Gene Hardin, J. O. Tig
nor, G. M. Brass, Jr., E. Cordova, R.
L. Carson, Chester Kiscr, G. S. Yates,
Fifer Caudle, Trancito Romero, R. E.
Wherritt, Frank Van Ordt, Fred Lu
jan, A. Schweppe, Pablo Gallegos, W.
W. Coulson, J. M. Winchester, C. A.
Law, Walton Snyder. v
After the election of delegates ex
cellent talks were made by a num
ber of the members. They key note
speech was made by H. J. Hammond
in which he out-lined the work to be
done by the Republicans of this county
and vividly portraying to them the
effect of organization and the effect of
efficient leadership. Among others
who made interesting talks we should
fail to give ability recognition should
we fail to mention the strong logical
address of Chas. A. Law. His address
contained no vague vaporing but went
straight to the issues before us and
emphasized the remarks of Mr. Ham
mond and set out at more length the
duties devolving on each Republican
of the county, the state and the na
tion. The least that can be said is
that it was a strong argument well
founded on logical reasoning for the
restoration of the Republican power
for the welfare of the county, state
and nation.
D. W. Snyder, A. C. Osborn, G. S.
Yates, O. T. Toombs, Wm. Mootz and
Carl Eklund each made good helpful
and interesting talks. ;
A motion was made and unanimous
ly carried that a REPUBLICAN
CLUB be organized in Precinct No. 1.
The organization elected C. A. Law as
president, II. J. Hammond Sr. Treas
urer, and H. II. Errett, Secretary. Ev
ery person who attended the conven
tion enrolled as a member of this club.
We now have a good strong club or
ganized and we desire to secure the

WOMEN THROW FALL
HATS IN THE RING
And Start a Merry War On
the Policies of the Presi
dent and His Sup
porters Colorado Springs, Aug. 12. Presi
dent Wilson ignored numerous tele
grams sent him last night by the Dem
ocratic members of the new Woman's
party, and tonight, the last session
finished, Miss Alice Paul, recognized
head of the organization, gave the
word for the beginning of the battle
against the president and his p?rty.
Ardent young fighters for tho cause
of suffrage were armed with soap
boxes and sailed forth to the streets
for speech making. It was their first
appearance in facing crowds, but they
were ordered to go in the interest of
preparedness they must be broken in
for the coming campaign which the
suffragists will conduct in the twelve
equal suffrage states.
"The failure of President Wilson
to answer the many telegrams sent
him, calling on him to give some ex
pression favoring the passage of the
Susan B. Anthony national woman
suffrage amendment, has destroyed
the party's last hope that he would
see the light," Miss Mabel Vernon, the
always active little secretary of the
organization declared.
"Some are still strong in the belief
that he will assume a passive attitude
and offer no opposition to the amend
ment if congress will bring it out of
committee for passage, providing a
stand on the matter is not requested
of him. But the rank and file have
lost hope, and from now on we will
fight the Democratic party just as
hard as we can."
The formal beginning of the big
drive, which, it is hoped by the femin
ine fighters, will push from political
power the president and office holders
in'his' party.'is scheduled for Sopt. 15V ;
The leaders today named women to
conduct the campaigns in the twelve
states, and aides chosen from the
states, where equal suffrage is not,
who desire to take up residence in
suffrage states so they may have a
vote, will be named later. There will
be many deserted Eastern homes for
the next few weeks. The women will
conduct a campaign in which bill pos
ters, cartoons, catchy advertising and
pamphlet circulation will be features.
Hughes is Only Hope
"And, without doubt, the workers
will campaign actively for the can
didacy of Mr. Hughes," Mrs. E. St.
Clair Thompson, now living in Ari
zona, said. "But we will not do so as '
a party, even tho we all desire his elec
tion. "In every state we will try to gain
women votes for him on the ground
that he is our only hope. Our nega
tive policy calling only for a fight
against the Democrats means merely
that we will not urge women desir
ous of voting for Prohibitionist or So
cialist candidates to sacrifice their de
sires and vote for the Republican tick
et." The members of the party left to
night for their homes to rest up, they
said, for the strenuous campaign to
come. Mrs. Florence Bayard Hilles
and Miss Rose Winslow, assigned to
be in charge of headquarters in Colo
rado will remain in the state.
Mrs. Hilles said tonight their plans
for the Colorado campaign had not
yet been made. i
FLYING MACHINE FOR FAIR
The Fair Association is trying to
get another aeroplane for the enter
tainment of the crowds at the fair
this fall. Negotiations are being
made now and if everything goes
right, the people of Union county will
have the pleasure .of seeing another
huge bird fiy over our city the same
as two years ago. A lot of amuse
ments are being planned for this event
and a number of the merchants are
offering special prizes for "stunts"
which will add much to the program.
We will give a list of these next week.
