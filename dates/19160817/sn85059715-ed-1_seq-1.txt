Flat Refusal on the Part of the

Eight-Hour Day.
tBY ASaociATID 4lll<
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 President
Wilson today invited tlie presidents
of the principal railroads of
the country to come to Washington
immediately to confer with him on
the threatened railroad strike. Pending
their arrival he does not plan to
I see the committee or managers with
whom he has been meeting.
I The president sent the following
telegram to the leading railroad
presidents:
"Discussion of the matters involved
in the threatened railroad strike
has reached a point which makes it
highly desirable that I should Personally
confer with you nl the earliest
possible moment and with the
president of other railways affected)
who may be immediately accessible, i
I hope you can make it convenient;
to come to Washington at once."
The president's action Is inter-1

I"0"-" ?- I
committee has finally refused to con-1
cede the eight-hour day as the president's
plan proposed, and the ques-1
tion is now to be taken up with the
heads of the railroads themselves. |
The situntion as It stood today was j
this:
The railroads flatly refused to eoncede
the eight-hour day but ai'e will-'
lug to arbitrate that question and ail
others before any tribunal that may |
be decided upon.
The men are willing to arbitrate j
some questions under certain conditions
and are unwilling to arbitrate
others.
At 3 o'clock tills atternoon ine
? president will present his plan to
^ the lull committee of 640 employes
In the hope of getting them to ap-1
prove it. The result will be present-1
ed to the railroad presidents later.
Early this morning Secretary Tumulty
telephoned to Daniel Willard,
president of the Baltimore and Ohio
Itailroad Company, regarding the invitation
to the railroad presidents to
come to the White House, and Mr.
I Willard said he would do everything
possible to arrange a conference.
May Invite Financiers.
Among the managers it was point-1
ed out that the president had been
1 constantly advised of the negotiations
with President Wilson and that the
feeling prevailed that the attitude
of the railroad heads was now the
same as the managers' committee, although
no one could forecast what |
effect a personal conference wltn tue j
president would have. The railroad
presidents are expected to make a
strong plea for preservation of the
principle ot arbitration and will express
their fear that if the present
difficulty cannot be settled without it
there is ltitlo hope that it will everj
be successful in the future.
In case President Wilson finds that
any of the railroad presidents Crtt
not speak absolutely for their roads'
he may invite to tlie White House
the financiers who control them, itj

Charles E. Hughes, before a largo
audience here last night, assailed
the Democratic party for its policy
toward the Philippines.
"We cannot afford In this country
to lose sight, of national obligations,"
Mrs, Hughes said. "Our friends on
the other side were almost ready to
say that we should abandon the Philippines.
That was a matter of national
honor. We assumed obligations
there which we aro bound to dis
vu.llfc*-.
"it is not so much a matter of selfinterest.
but when this nation undertakes
before the world a responsivlllty,
it must discharge it.
"And we ought not to consider the
suggestion ot scuttling out of the
Philippines to leave them In the predicament
which you know perfectly
well without my describing it."
Sir. Hughes, in an address to the
Portland Advertising Club, in which
he advocated commercial preparedness
for European competition
through the agency of a protective
tariff, today branded as a traitor to
his country the man who sought, lo
build up bis private fortttno at public,
expenses.
"The man who tries to get the better
of the public for his private
purse," the uominge said, "is a traitor
to the government. We will go
ahead and put these traitors out of
business while we build up the business
of the United States."
The commercial problems which
the country" will face after the war,
Mr. Hughes said. "will bo greater
than over before."

American farmer may know what to
expect under its terms. This section
is to conduct hearings to develop facts
as to the status in America of tho
farm tenant, the farm laborer and the
immigrant in his relation to the land.
The conference leaders expect the
hearing to put the delegates in a position
to sound the dominant chord
in the formation of a comprehensive
land policy for the United States. How
to handle the immigrant and how to
move landless men to the land will
be stressed. Economists, government
officials and leaders in industries dependent
on farming will co-operate.

.1. S. Knllison. another athletic
star turned out l?y Weslovan, will be
assistant coach. Noulo will also
coach tile basketball team, and Kellison
will remain througfhout the
year as gymnasium instructor and
assistant in other branches oi' athletics
than football.
both Neale and Kel 1 ison are distinctly
Wesieyan products and while
the selection of these men does not
by any moans indicate that Wesley
an will definitely adopt a system of
graduate coaching, it does Indicate
that of all the largo number of applicants
for the position of coaches here
that these were considered the most
available. Neale was secured only
after long and tedious negotiations
for his release from a contract which
ho had signed to coach at Muskingum
College in Ohio, hut since his
phenomenal success with the Muskingum
squad in 1015 it has been the
sot purpose of those in authority hero
to secure him if possible. Neale came
.o Wcsleyan from Parkersburg high
school where ho had reigned supreme
and terrorized all opponents
by his skill at handling forward pass
eg in (ootoail linn inn groan UI1 iuuuu
?nmo at basketbull. Hero lie Immediately
made himself a local idol liy
contributing ill a large measure to
Weslcyan's winning her llrst state
championships in football, baseball
and basketball. After leaning bore
in the spring of 1814 he played with
Toledo In tho American Association
it baseball and tho following year
with Wheeling in the Central League.
From litis club ho was drafted by
Cincinnati and has been making good
m the "big show" with a vengeance.
Ivelllson has for four years been allitate
selection as tackle and Ills wide
experience as well as the great prestige
lie has throughout tho state
should stand him In good stead In
his duties hero.
The bringing of No,do and Kellison
Into Wesleyan athletics places
the entire authority In athletics
here under graduate control, Stunsburg
having been re-elected graduate
manager and athletic director last
June. This trio played a most important
part in the bringing of Wesleyan's
llrst championships here In
J!) 12 and It is singular that after a
.. -r 1.. vnnrc tbev should
lapse ui *?111_> j - ... ?
be seen In the places of authority.
Nealo and Kelllson will liavo a
tough row to hoe this fall since Wesieyan
is scheduled to meet Washington
and Jefferson, Pennsylvania,
Pennsylvania State, Georgetown,
Marietta, Westminster, West Virginia
and other minor teams, and the
icliedulii is generally regarded as the
most difficult that any Orange and
Black team has ever had to play.
The time for Neale's reporting has
not been definitely decided but it Is
expected that he will be able to get
riway by September 20 at the latest
as It Is apparent even at this date
that Cincinnati is not a factor in tho
league's race for the pennant.

In some of the counties there are Inluentlal
Democrats who are oponty
iroclaiming that they will vote lor
Sutherland. It isn't questioned by any
mo that he will receive the vote of * M
lis own party practically to a man.
As lo the balance of the ticket, ConjreBsman
Sutherland said today:
"Tho situation In the state as I 1 1
'ound it looks bright for the Republi- '
an ticket throughout. There Isn't a
loubt in my mind but what the state

mrty voters are well pleased with the i I
latlnnal nominees and express them- I
lelvcs to that effect with enthusiasm.
Die opposition are loudly claiming
hat they have a good chance to elect
i governor. I certainly failed to find
mndltions in our party to justify their

rill mean his election, of course. As
o the rest of the ticket, there isn't
he least doubt in my mind of Its sueess
at the polls. -'tja|
