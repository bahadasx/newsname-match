Mr. George B. Edgerton, At
torney of Record for the Mille
Lac Band of Indians, having filed
with the Chief Clerk of the Court
of Claims on July 29, 1916, a con
sent to the reduction of the judg
ment, and an agreement to accept
the sum of $689,460,54 with inter
est at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum on $487,873.94 from Dec
ember 6, 1915 till paid, I have the
honor to inform you that no ap
peal will be taken by the United
State* to the Supreme Court in
the case.
Very respectfully,
(Signed) Jno. W. Davis,
Solicitor General.
The Mille Lac Indians are en
titled to all they will get from the
Mille Lac judgment, and under
the terms of the agreement tbey
will probably receive all of it.
The history of the Mille Lac
case i* in brief this: Immediately
following the Rice agreement of
1889, the Mille Lac Chippewas
commenced to clamor for the al
lotments which the Kice Oommis
sion promised tbem would be made
upoo the Mille Lac reservation,
bat for a year or two the commis
sion put them off upon one pretext
or another. In the meantime the
publisher of THE TOMVHAWK, who
had been their advisor since 1886,
and prior thereto, advised them
that under the explanation of the
Kice mniissio of the act of
1#?9, they had unquestionable
/rights to allotment* upon the Mille
Lac reservation. This they insist
ed the government should fulfill.
But in order to compel tbem to
remove to White Earth an order
was issued by the Interior Depart
ment to pay them no annuities at
Mille Lac and to compel tbem to
go to White Earth for these.
This they refused to do, and as a
result they received no annuities
for several years. On July 2,
1896, upon the invitation of the
Mille Lac band, the publisher, who
was then in the government ser
vice, went to Mille Lac from St.
Paul, where he was then living,
and on July 6, of the same year
entered into a contract with the
band to take charge of all their
affairs, and try and secure the
fulfillment of the promises made
to them by the government.
Through Major Robert M. Al
leii, then Indian agent here, Com
missioner of Indian Affairs Brown
ing issued an order for the pay
ment to the Mille Lac Cnippewas
to he made at Mille Lac, and the
following spring, ur a year after
the publisher had accepted em
ployment, this was done.
In the meantime the publisher
having resigned from the govern
ment service to take up the work
fo.r the Mille Lac Indians accord
ing to his agreement with them,
went to Washington with a dele
gation of chiefs and urged that the
allotments be made at Mille Lac
to the Mille Lac Chipoewas as
promised to them. The Secretary
of the Interior then issued an
order to the Chippewa Commission
to meet the Mille Lac Chippevvas
in council whenever they would
notify him of the date of the coun
cil. This council was held in Sep
tember 1897, and Chairman Hall
of thecommission ndtifiecl the In
dians that there remained only a
little over 5,000 acres from which
they could take allotments and
these lands were away from the
shore of Mille Lac. Although
the Indians continued to insist up
on having their allotments given
to them at Mille Lac, the com
mission refused to do so.
Finally several suits were com
menced for allotments in the local
land office at St. Cloud against set
tlers, but only the case of Chief
Me ge see was concluded which
was in his favor. The other suits
were dismissed after the Indians
received compensation for their
improvements at Mille Lac
1902.
Following the settlement for
compensation for improvements,
steps were immediately taken by
the publisher to commence the
suit which has just been settled
finally by the judgment hereinbe
fore referred to.
During all the proceedings chiefs
Wah-we yea-cumig and Ain dus-o
geshig or Andrew Daily, have
given much of their time to the
Mille Lac suit, especially during
the first ten years when they
spent every winter at Washington,
and were compelled to let their
families shift for themselves dur
ing their absences there. The fee
which the Mille Lac Chippewas
have allowed their chiefs have
been well earned by the latter,
and it will no doubt be a source of
giatification to the band that it has
the matter in its own hands to pass
upon.
The suit went up to the Supreme
Court once, but was sent back to
the Co'irt of Claims for a reap
praisal of the damage the Indians
had sustained.
It was thought possible that the
ca- would again be appealed to
the Supreme Court, but the fore
going letter seitles that.
Now is the

THE TOMAHAWK
HUGHES' LEADING
Judge Hughes is making the
civil service the leading issue in
his campaign and has attacked the
Wilson administration for making
certain changes which he said in a
speech was a violation of the civil
service law.
By his attacks upon the Wilson
administration, on account of the
civil'service law which is not pop
ular witl? the masses because of
the manner in which it has been
conducted, Judge Hughes is mak
ing votes lor his opponent.
It is not the mistakes of Presi
dent Taft that made him so un
popular throughout the country,
but it was the manner in which
the departments during his admin
istration administered the affairs
of the government, and he allowed
subordinates to have full sway.
Under the civil service law
rings have organized in the de
partments of the government that
a president could not overcome in
one term even if he should devote
much time to doing so.
Whenever a new president is
elected and promulgates his poli
cies, they are ruthlessly ignored
by the rings of the departments if
not in line with their views, and
he remains in ignorance of this
until it is too late, or when he is
about to relinquish the high office
which he is filling.
When President Wilson was
elected it was hoped by the masses
that he would make such changes
in the departments as would cause
the country to be relieved from
the thralldom and oppression of
the subordinates of the depart
ments, and by making a sufficient
number of changes the rings would
be destroyed.
Among those who are familiar
with the rings in the different de
partments it is said that the same
conditions exist almost to the
same extent as in the Interior de
partment.
The worst branch of the Inter
ior Department is the Indian ser
vice, and while the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs and his assistant
may be trying to do all in their
power to correct evils, informa
tion from the different reserva
tions throughout the country is
given that not much, if any, im
provement is being made.
The civil service law with its
provisions to establish practically
a monarchial form of govern
ment will never become popular in
this country, and it is even prob
able that unintentionally Judge
Hughes has raised the issue which
will cause its repeal sooner or
later. Should Apply Govern
ment's Filipino Policy
Here,
The federal administration's
policy of giving the Filipinos the
preference of filling the offices in
the administration of their own
affairs must be source of much
gratification to them, and will no
doubt have a great tendency to
wards settling the questions which
have been more or less a source of
trouble.a'id anxiety to the govern
ment.
Recently Harry T. Edward*,
for fifteen years director of agri
culture in the Philippine islands,
resigned and Andriano Hernandez,
a Filipino, was appointed to suc
ceed him. Vincent Aldaness, an-
Truth before Favor."

other Filipino, v\ill succeed John
S. Stanley as deputy collector of
customs. Jose Escaler, a .Filipino
attorney, will probably be appoint
ed to the position of assistant di
rector of education.
The most important position to
which a Filipino has been appoint
ed was that of Joaquin DeLuna as
governor of the mountain province
of the Philippines.
The Wilson administration has
taken a wise step in conceding to
the Filipinos the right to a large
extent to administer their own
affairs, and from this the Ameri
can Indians should take courage,
for the policy applied to the Fili
pinos may be applied to them.
There is evidently an encour
agement from the administration
to resignation from white citizens
in the Philippines, and when va
cancies thus occur to at once fill
them with Filipinos.
But note how it stands with the
Chippewas. It, is not a mere de
partmental policy but a United
States law which provides that the
Chippewas of Minnesota shall be
given preference as employes in
the Chippewa Indian service of
this state where the salaries of the
positions are paid from Chippewa
tribal fund".
How is the Indian office acting?
It is ignoring the law as expressed
not only in the last Indian appro
priation act, but in prior laws and
treaties. It evades by saying:
"There are no vacancies."
Resignations should be asked
for from white employees if Chip
pewas of Minnesota file applica
tions for the positions, and are
competent to fill them.

prices and kindly, courteous treatment.
r
in serving you, well come here.
When transfers are made and a
local vacancy occurs the place
should not be filled by a transferee
from another point, or froai an
awaiting list, but should be filled
at once by a Chippewa of the
Minnesota bands. In order to do
this applicants should file and not
withdraw their applications, or
suffer them to be forgotten with
the answer: "No vacancy.1'
The Filipino situation will fur
nish a strong precedent for the In
dian office to follow.
The Filipinos aie paying their
own way to a large extent, while
the Chippewas are paying theirs
entirely, and therefore morally as
well as legally are entitled to the
benefits which would be derived
from their own funds, in salaries
as well as otherwise.
The Filipino policy is in line
with that advocated on behalf of
the Chippewas by TIIK TOMA
HAWK, to give the position-, in the
Chippewa Indian service to Chip
pewas and which belong to them
by law.
Indians Will Lose Good
Friend.
For many years Representative
Stephens, chairman of the House
Indian committee at Washington,
has represented his state in Con
gress, but during the past summer
he was defeated at the primaries
for a renomination, and, there
fore, he will cease to be a con
gressman after March 4th next.
It seems unnecessary to mention
to the Indians generally ihrough-

has been one of thi-ir best and

In view of his familiarity with
Indian questions and Indian legis
lation, President WiUon \sould
improve the Indian service im
mensely if he is re elected and
should make Mr. Stephens Com

No man could be appointed who
could and would give the Indian

than Mr. Stephens, and who
would put through the recent laws
which aim to improve Indian con
ditions and the service.
The EMj_lB_SiEM.
According to the Minneapolis
Tribune, the land cases of this
reservation are about to be settlt d.
Attorney Kearful of the Depart
ment of Justice has done more
towards trying to secure an equit
able settlement of the White
Earth land suits in six months
than M. C. Burch and C. C. Dan
iels did or attempted to do in six
years witli a large force.
The trouble with Burch was
that he started in to keep an aimy
of relatives and friends employed,
while Daniels settled down to hold
a position indefinitely without ac
complishing anything.
The plan which will be the basis
of settlement, according to the
Tribune, should bo satisfactory to
every person interested in a fair
deal.
