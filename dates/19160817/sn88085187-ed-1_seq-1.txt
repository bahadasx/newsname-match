FOREIGN NATIONS
MAPPING ALASKA
COAL LAND; WHY?
For three months Jack ■liingmc.ver, of the Times staff, has been traveling in Alaska and through
the Hering Hea islands—a country unknown, yet of vast richness; a country teeming with news,
romance and adventure. He Is just returned.
Mis first article—the story of the Alaska coal fields, unprotected and a tempting bait for any
foreign power—is printed herewith.
In May, through the courtesy of the coast guard service, Juiic»meyer left lhe Sound iiboard the
cutter Manning for Dutch Harbor, I'nnlaska, on the Aleutian peiinsuln. Since then he has cov
ered 7,000 miles aboard I'mlo Sam's Far-North |«atiol l-oat*.
He visited the Pribiloff seal islands, Uncle Sam's «18,000,000 inc.eminent ,„ the Arctic circle.
He wUI tell you about them.
Ho visited every coast city of importance in Alaska and dozens of small, unknown islands, the
outposts of YOUR pei sessions in lhe Far North.
He has colected dozens of stories of the romuiice, the adventure and the news of this unknown
country.
These stories you will get from time to time in The Times. Match for them. They are the stor
ies of the pioneers of the Northland; of the men aud women who risked their lives to blaze the trail
of . h Hi/;,Hon into the wilderness.
BY JACK JUNGMEYER
SEWARD, Alaska, Aug. 17.—Alaskan coal, a big national asset, is also a
grave national menace.
§ Unless properly protected at Resurrection Bay and Cook In
let, the fine steaming fuel of Matanuska and Nenana fields,
tapped by the government railroad, will be rich bait for an in
vading enemy.
A hostile fleet from the Orient would want no finer base of
operations against the Pacific ('oast that Resurrection Bay, large
and deep enough to float half a dozen navies.
Linked with coal mines by rail, such a harbor becomes a tre
mendous war factor.
Confidential agents of every foreign government in the
la<) , North Pacific have heen closely watching developments on the
Jungmejer government railroad here and preparations to tap this new coal
supply.
Japanese, Russian, English and German agents are known to be here now,
completing the most detailed surveys of the entire region.
Within a few months steel will have been laid from Seward and Anchor
age to the Matanuska coal district, and terminal facilities provided at the
wharves.
Alaskan coal thus becomes the key to the preparedness program for the
West and North coasts, not alone as a source of supply for our own navy, but
as a prize that must be protected.
fortified possession of Resurrection Bay as a naval base whence subma
rines and fast cruisers might issue full-fueled would make the North Pacific
untenable for any antagonist.

■■ THAT ONE SPEECH
PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 17. —
Charles Evans Hughes spoke here
last night. He criticised the
democratic party for its Philip

he said it had assumed as to the
tariff.

For several years they lived in

Then, anxious to see his foster

to this city.

talking about his boyhood days
when he recollected that years
before he had packed away a lot
of trinkets and toys in an old
trunk.
Tho man came upon a locket.
"A picture of my mother and
father," he said, handing it to His
wife.
The woman stared wide
eyed at the picture, then at
her husband. Hurried sen

was a picture of her father
and mother, too. In addition
to being man and wife, they
were also brother and sister.
