Political Qossip from
Washington.
Washington, Aug. 14. (Special
Correspondence.) One of the no
ticeable and somewhat important
features of the present political
situation is that the Democrats
are frequently excusing or even
ly condemning some of the poli
cie3 of the Wilson administration.
Members of the Senate and of
the House ha?e came to realize
that Wilson's popularity and his
conseauent strength are not what
they were two years ago and that
they cannot hope to , win their
own flection? by merely shout
ing for Wilson. On the contra
ry, they can now see that when
he November race has ended,
the man who is hangii.g to the
coat tails of WoodroW Wilson will
be too far in the rear to be a win
ner. XXX
Senator Stone of Missouri, who,
however, does not come up for
election this year, is one member
of the Democratic side of the up
por rVouse of Congress who has
recently taken a fling at the ex
ecutive branch of the govern
ment for its violation of the
pledge of simplicity and economy.
, While the agricultural appropri
ation bill was under considera
. tion and the item for purchase Df
- . automobiles was up for action,
Senator Stone , condemned in
s;athing terms the extravagance
of the departments in the pur
chase and use of automobiles.
Stone , declared that for many
years he has traveled about the
city of Washington on business
connected with his office and has
used the street cars, walked, or
paid his own auto bills. He could
see no reason why the well-paid
officials of the executive depart--'ments
should sot do the same.
While he did not call particular
attention to the Democratic
pledge of simplicity, he must
have had it in mind when he
" condemned the "3tiobbery ex
ploited at the,-public expense." j
While the Stone speech may help
Stone when he comes up for re
election, it won't help President
Wilson win votes in November,
1516.
The break to cover the Demo
crats madt on the child labor bill
in the Senate, has caused great
amusement to the Republican
members. The anxiety of the
President himself, was one of the
ludicrous things. It ' was the
plan of the southern senator to
put this measure off jantil the
next session and try to place the
blame on ' the Republicans, but
v Senator Gallinger, the Republi
can floor leader, very forcefully
placed the issue before the Sen
ate and the country and showed
up the Democratic party in its
true light. ; Then came the DenV
ocratic scramble led by the Pres
ident in favor of immediate ac
tion on this important measure.

The remaining members of the
House in Washington and they
jure few aVe oaly those who are
interested in legislation that is
pending in conference. One of
the measures that has kept a
number of members present was
that relating to the continuation
of an appropriation of $3,000,000
for the extension of the Appala
chian mountain forest reserve.
This sum of money expired un
der the original bill for the rea
son that it lapsed before it could
be legally used. Several of the
New England and the southern
members are much interested- in
this proposition.
XXX
Republican members cf Con
gress in both branches are re
ceiving many words of encour-
agement of the Republican out
look in ' their respective states
The attempt of Vance McCor
mick and the Democrats to stir
up turmoil in the rar ks of the
former Progressives has every
where virtually met with failure.
News comes from all sections of
a united and enthusiastic Repub
lican party
XXX
"Mr. Hughes bas already dem
onstrated his ability and his fit
ness in the manner in which he
is so skilfully " handling the re
cent rehabilitation of the Repub
lican party," said Congressman
Edward Wason of New Hamp
shire. 4 'The course of Mr. Hughes
ha greatly-helped -to- ironotit
many things" that' might have
been perplexing. He has dealt
fairly with all and with firmness
and great judgment. He is go
ing to have no bickerings in the
party and we are going into the
coming campaign united and in
harmony. ,This means nothing
but victory in November."

Quite a change in the temper

Without doubt our vicinity will

An all-day meeting will be held

We predict an interesting' and

been generally satisfactory. A
good ticket has been nominated.
but the question remains wheth

have resulted from the rule in

seems certain r the present mode
is much more costly, but it is
classed as progressive and it
seems certain we cannot have
anything worch while without
paying the price.

Why Endure Summer
Colds?
it isn't necessary to have a
stuffed head, running nose. To
cough your head off as it were.
All you need do is to use Dr.
Bell's Pine-Tar-Honey. The
soothing and healing balsams op
en the clogged air passages and
in a short time you get relief and
start on the road to recovery.
Your nose stops running, you
cough less and you know you are
getting better. Get a bottle, use
as directed. Keep what is left
as a cough and cold insurance.

More Room for Autos.
That mpra room has been need-

by its recent action. A portion
of the southeast corner of the
grounds' heretofore occupied by
hitching racks has been arranged
for parking auto3, and machines
coming in the Eaton, , Arcanum

admitted at the south gates. Ar

The dealings of the administration
with Mexico constitute a confused
chapter of blunders. It is a record
which"" cannot be examined without a
profound sense of humiliation.
We must take Vera Cruz to get Huor

policy!
Destroying the government of Huertaf
we left Mexico to the ravages of revo
lution. I stand for adequate federal work

The administration was to seize and
punish Villa for his outrage on our soil.
It has not punished any one; we went
in only to retire.
I favor the vote for women.
THINGS
IN PREPAREDNESS THE AD
MINISTRATION HAS FOL
LOWED, NOT LED.
In the demand for reasonable
preparedness the administration
has followed, not led. Those
who demanded more adequate
forces were first described as
"nervous and excited." Only
about a year and a half ago we
were, told that the question of
" preparedness was not ft pressing
one; that the country had been
misinformed. Later, under the
pressure of other leadership, this
attitude was changed. The ad
ministration, it was said, had
"learned something." and it made
a belated demand for an in
creased army. Even then the
demand was not prosecuted con
sistently and the pressure ex
erted on congress with respect
to other administrative measures
was notably absent.
We are told that the defects re
vealed by the present mobillza-
- tion are due to the "system." But
it was precisely such plain de
fects that under .the constant
warnings of recent years, with
the whole world intent on mili
tary concerns, should have been
studied and rectified." The ad'
ministration has failed to dis
charge its responsibilities. Ap
parently it is now seeking ta
meet polftlcal exigencies by its'
naval program. But It has im
posed upon the country an in
competent naval administration.

FAVORS WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Some time ago a consideration
of our economic conditions and
tendencies, of the position of
women in gainful occupations,
of the nature and course of the
demand, led me to the conclu
sion that the granting of suf
frage to women is inevitable.
Opposition may delay, but in
my judgment canuot defeat this
movement. If women are to
have the vote, as I believe they
are, it seems to me entirely
clear that in the interest of the
public life of this country the
contest should be ended prompt
ly. I favor the vote for women.
