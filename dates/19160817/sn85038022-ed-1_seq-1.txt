Preparr-diir
Through PralM'tlve
Tariff.
Portland, Ore., August 16-Oharles
K Haghea in an address to the Port
lnd Advertising Cltib, In which he ad
vocated commercial preparedness for
European competition through the
agency of a protective tariff, today
branded aa a traitor to hla country
the man who aonghr to build up hla
private fort ana al public expense.
"The man who trios to got the bet
ter of the public for hla private
purpoae," the nominee said, "Is a trai
tor to the government. We will go
ahead and put theae traitors out of
business while wa build up the busl
ncaa of the United States."
The commercial problems which
the country will face after the war,
Mr. Hughes said, will be greater than
ever before.
Moat Save Country
"We must save this country every
day. It won't be saved by letting it
drift. It won't be saved by taking
everything for granted. It industries
won't be conaerced by Indulging in
good wishes around the club table.
"We have got to take account of the
lessons learned on the other side and
apply them. We have got to consider
honest business with the success and
pride that It deserves, and we have
got to fearlessly condemn abuses.

"Wa have got the haals for suocees
What we now need la the motive
power of unawervlng lowalty and a
real consciousness of national unity
which will nil us with a dominant
cnae of patriotic loyalty to the Unit
ed States.
"With that we want a conception of
real government. We want to be woll
tirepared, well organised commercial
ly and Industrially We have got to
rnatch organisation with organisation,
preparedness abroad with prepared
ness at home-In all things "
In opening his address. Mr. Hughes
declared that, while he waa speaking
to the Portland Advertising Club, he
waa a member of the "Republican Ad
vertlalng Club."
"For the present I am spokesman
of that organization," he continued
"It waa not ever thus." After the
laughter which greeted this remark
had subsided the nominee continued:
"A short time ago I was long on
silence and short on talks; now I am
lung on talk and short on silence. The
reason is that I was mandamuaed in
Oregon."
Refers to Oregon's Action
Mr. Hughes' reference to the notion
of Oregon Republicans In Instructing
their delegates to the Chicago conven
tion for him waa greeted with ap
plause. "I waa intent on observing
the obvious properties of the position
that I held," he said. "It was a place
of great distinction and power in
whfch I waa content to remain. When
suggestions came from Oregon that I
should run In your primary, I waa
very curt In refusing. I had no de
sire to run; I wanted to remain alone
"But they reckon ill who leave Ore
gon out. You listened and did what
you pleased, and for the first time In
the history of the country a state
court mandamused a federal Judge."
In speaking of preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said:
"I desire to see the United States
holding its head erect among the peo
ples of the earth, not trembling, not
blustering, but ready for any emer
gency. We have In this country op
portunities that dazzle the Imagination."
These said the nominee, could beat
be developed under an efficient form
of government.

TlTtlf 0!T THE WATER
Since the removal of the watering
trough at the corner of Commerce and
East Second streets quite a bit of
complaint has been registered because
the drivers have no place to water
their horses. It seems as If the water
might be turned on In the fountain
The water now In the fountain is what
collected there during the rain yester
day and is an excellent home for
mosquitoes. The Board of Health
might condemn It as a nuisance or or
der the water to be turned on. The
contents of the basin la a follows: One
old shoe, a cord of wood, a bale of
loose paper, remains of a cantaloupe
feast and an old hat. It should be as a
matter of civic pride that the fountain
be cleaned out and the water turned
on. This would take about fifteen
minutes and do a great deal of good
BRICK STREET NEWS
COL. HRIIHJKS SERIOI'SLT ILL
Preparations were being made this
morning on feaat Second street to do
aome more bricking. It seems as If
the contractora are rather slow In
this matter as they have nothing at all
to hinder them In the work. They will
probably push the work now until they
nave finished to Poplar street. Excava
tion haa not been carried on this week
on account of the wet weather. The
south side of the street will be excava
ted and concreted as far as Union
street and then the mixer will be
brought to Bridge street again.
Schoolfleld and Jones have not done
any work this week on bricking upper
Button. All of the material la on
hands, sand for the bed, brick, etc.
Yeaterday they received two cars of
brick which are being unloaded.

"The Home of QUALITY Clothes"
""""""""""" BBaaaaaaaiMsaaSBae
There Was a Time When a Man Dressed
According To His Years
This conception has undergone a change. Men dress as old as they feel now. There is no
good reason in the world why a man's years should decide the cut of his clothes.
We have clothes for young men eighteen to sixty. These clothes are for men who realize
the important part "youthful" clothes play in their lives.
Carlyle wrote a book about clothes. But it pretty well simmers down to the idea that we
can make ourselves what we will by dressing and thinking tho part.
