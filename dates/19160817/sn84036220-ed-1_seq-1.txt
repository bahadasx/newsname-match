NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
PETROGRAD, Aug. 16—(Via Lon
don Aug. 17, 31:5 a. m.)—Gen. Nicho
las Ruzsky has been appointed com'
mander-in-chlef of the northern armies
of Russia.
General Ruzsky was In command of
the northern Russian army at the out
break of the war. He was credited
with the series of brilliant operations
which culminated In the capture of
Lemberg and was hailed as the hero
of the hour in Russia. Shortly after
wards It was announced that he was
In ill health and in May, 1915, he re
tired from the army and was succeed
ed by General Alexlev, the present
chief of staff.
In July, 1915, General Ruzsky re
sumed command of the northern arm
ies but six months later was rellevj.1
from his post by the emperor. An im
perial rescript said that the difficult
task of defending Petrograd had ser
iously Injured the general's health.
General Ruzsky is 62 years old. He
was wounded In the Turkish war of
1877-78 and was quartermaster gen
eral during the Russo-Japanese v f i \
For the first time in many days no
Important action iB reported from the
Russian front and the same dearth of
news prevails in regard to the Italian
operations. The most interesting Item
of news regarding the Italian advance
against Trlest is contained in a news
dispatch from Milan, which says that
German troops are to be employed in
the defense of the big Austrian port.
If corroborated, this means that Italy
end Germany will at last enter an
active state of war.

GREAT PICTURE
"RACING WITH DEATH IN ANT
ARCTIC BLIZZARDS" IS GENU
INE THRILLER.
ENTERTAINERS ARE ALSO PLEASING
The Chautauqua held its own in
spite of the circus yesterday, espec
ially in the evening when the big tent
was filled to see the extraordinary pic
tures of the Antarctic world and listen
to the lecture by Dr. Hunsbarger. The
audience yesterday afternoon was de
lightfully entertained by the Elite
whistlers and Francis Labadie, a read
er and impersonator of no meager tal
ent. These entertainers also preced
ed the lecture last evening. They all
were insistently encored and Mr. La
badie charmed particularly In his
readings from Robert W. Service.
The famous pictures and lecture,
"Racing With Death in Antarctic Bliz
zards," a most marvelous hour and
a half of entertainment. To know
that the wonderful scenes upon the
screen were actually taken where
blizzards sometimes roar at 216 miles
an hour and where the warmest sum
mer weather Is below zero, was almost
awesome. Some of the scenes were
beautiful, some grotesque and all won
der-lnsplrlng. Of course, it was the
greatest picture of its kind ever shown
here and one which never will be for
gotten by those who saw it. Dr. Huns
berger, who gave the very interesting
lecture which accompanied the pic
tures, was a personal friend and asso
ciate of Sir Douglas Mawson, who
was the first to explore these great
Ice regions and for whom the pictures
are named. This entertainment is one
of the Chautauqua's biggest features
tills year.
The program for today will be as
follows:

ISSUES OUTLINED
In a Letter Addressed to the Voters
of Montana the Governor Submits
For Consideration the Record of the
Present Administration and Out
lines the Issues Upon Which He
Proposes to Conduct His Campaign
For Re-Election—Speaks Only of
Facts Which Are Disclosed by the
Public Records.
HELENA, Aug. 15.—In an opon let
ter, addressed to the people of Mon
tana, Gov. S. V. Stewart today re
viewed the record of the present ad
ministration and outlined the issues
upon which he proposes to conduct his
campaign for re-election, in his let
ter the governor said:
"To the people of Montana:
"In submitting to you my candidacy
for re-election as governor, I deem
it fitting that I should call attention
to the record of this administration,
to the end that, with the facts before
you, you may give earnest thought to
the question of whether that record
merits your approval. A public of
ficer is but a public servant. When
ever his official acts are contrary to
the desires of the people it is their
duty to dismiss him; but, whenever
his official acts reflect the wishes of
a majority of his constituents, that
constituency owes to good govern
ment the duty of sustaining him. On
this basis, I cheerfully submit my of
ficial record.
Law and Order.
"During my administration I have
endeavored to uphold and enforce the
law. On one solemn occasion 1
deemed it necessary to use the su
preme power of tlie state to protect
life and property. For the first time
in the history of this commonwealth,
I called upon the national guard to
uphold constituted authority and to
suppress anarchy. Happy indeed was
the result. Without the spilling of
a drop of blood and without the firing
of a shot order was restored, life and
property were made safe and indus
trial peace and an unprecedented de
gree of prosperity succeeded what
threatened to be a long period of vio
lence and disorder, with its inevitable
poverty and suffering.
"DOES THAT ACTION MERIT
YOUR APPROVAL?
Workmen's Compensation.
"After more than 10 years of agi
tation, this administration has placed
in operation a plan which insures
compensation to workingmen injured
in hazardous employments and pro
tection to their dependents in case of
fatal injury. The machinery of the
industrial accident board was placed
in operation at a cost of less than
half of the minimum ever attained in
any other state. During the first year
of the operation of this law, the sum
of $388,505.70 was promptly paid to
injured workmen or their dependents,
a greater sum than was ever awarded
in any one year in personal injury
cases growing out of similar acci
dents. These payments were made
without long and tedious court trials
and without the burdensome fees of
attorneys which formerly cut so deep
ly into the award made the claimant.

The Chamber of Commerce lunch

noon was very successful if one took
into account the talks tliut were made
rather than the attendance. There
were about forty there, and there is
little doubt but the usual number
would have been present hud it not
been circus day. The reason circus
day was chosen in the first place was
to get hold of the unusual number of
farmers who might be in the city and
who would he interested in a subject
as vitally interesting as the county
high school.
Principal F. L. Cummings of the
Fergus county high school was pres
ent and made an address on high
school matters which convinced his
hearers that he knows what he is
talking about. He will be asked by
the Chamber of Commerce members
again in the near future questions
pertaining to the high school, and the

Railways company hud violated the
agreement of August 7, which brought
the strike on the surface car lines to
an end.
Mr. Shouts denied that his com
pany had discharged workers because
of their affiliation witli the carmens'
union and added that "in many cases
employes of tills company iiuve clear
ly violated the rules of this company,
some of the violations increasing the
hazard and endangering the safety of
passengers on our cars."
In a circular distributed among its
employes, the position of the company
was defined in part as follows:
"Tills company lias not sanctioned
the unionizing of its men. It has said
that if any employe desires to Join a
union he shall not be prevented from
doing so by coercion or intimidation,
neither shall he be discharged for
joining. It has also been said that if
any employe does not desire to join
a union lie shall not be coerced or
intimidated into doing so either by
unionized employes of this company
or members of any organization not
employes of this company.
"The company explicitly reserved
the direction and control of employes
in all matters looking to efficiency in
the service. The most important item
of efficiency of service is the mainten
ance of reasonable and fair disci
pline. The agreement stipulates that
no matters relating to questions of
discipline or efficiency shall be sub
ject to conference or arbitration."
Tlie resolutions of the car men
adopted tonight after authorizing
their leaders to call a suspension of
work on all lines of the New York
Railways company unless a satisfac
tory agreement can be reached to

This is the time of the year that
(lie hoboes and undesirables are pen

in nearly every case, they take advan

that all doors and windows are se

WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.—Today
President Wilson completed a definite
plan for settlement of the threatened
nation-wide railroad strike and will
submit it to representatives of Die
managers and employes tomorrow. Al
though udmiuistrulion officials said
negotiations would be continued until
a peaceful solution was found, the out
eome of tlie president's mediation is
expeeted to depend largely on tho at
ilt tide of the two sides toward the
plan ho bus drawn up.
The proposal framed by tlie presi
dent following conferences with tlie
managers and employes since Monday
morning Hiiys Hint the railways should
concede the eight-hour work day with
an agreement that it will he reserved.
I.liter it. pniliulily will he proposed Hint
a federal commission appointed by tho
president or created by congress In
vestigate nil problems which have
arisen during Die present discussion.
Tlie obstacles in tlie way of accep
tance of Die plan, lies ill tho Insis
tence of Die railroad managers on ar
bitration and their opposition to Die
eight-hour day ami Die demand for
time and a half for overtime. Whether
the two sides will give in on these
points constituted tho chief danger in
Die situation tonight.
The general committee of the em
ployes, Including 640 representatives
of the trainmen mid ougltinmen on tho
225 railroad systems of the country
arrived here tonight In response to
a summons by their sub-committee
which Iiuh been meeting with tho pres
ident. The general committee has
plenary powers to accept or reject
any suggestion.
The men, although refraining from
discussing tho plan of the president,
said they thought Die outlook encour
aging for a settlement.
At 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon the
president will meet the entire com
mittee of 640 in tho east room of the
White House and lay before them Ills
plans, lie will accompany it with a
statement, nppoullng to their patriot
ism and urging a compromise In tho
Interests of the people of the nation.
While no time has been set. for a
conference between the managers'
commit tee and the president, it fa
thought probable It will take place to
morrow morning.
When Mr. Wilson sees the man
agers lie will mnke practically the
same statement he will deliver to tho
employes, paying particular attention,
however, to the points he feels the
managers should concede. Tho presi
