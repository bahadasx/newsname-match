erators on the Iron Range where a
strike is In progress complained to the
authorities to-day against repeated
threats from representatives of the
Industrial Workers of the World to
destroy the operators and their prop
erty. The operators charged that in
asmuch as the threats have been sent
by mall they involve violation of Fed
eral laws.

ben received by loyal employes, some
enclosing a small piece of black crepe.
This, the letters pointed out, was only
a sample of what would be hanging
on the recipient's door unless he

Renewal of Recent N. Y„
Trolley Strike Threatens
New York, Aug. 17. A conference
to-day between Frank Hedley, general
manager of the New York Railways
Company and a committee of commis

bring their differences which threaten
a renewal of the recent strike any
nearer a settlement. Two thousand
employes of the New York Railways
Company voted last night to quit
work if their grievances were not ad
justed. Before going on strike, how
ever, they voted to call upon Mayor
Mitchel and the chairman of the
down State Public Service Commission
to use their influence to induce the
officials of the company to put Into
effect agreements which were made
as a result of the strike early this
month.
Members of street car men's union
have voted to sustain the committee
in conference with Mr. Hedley to-day
in insisting upon recognition of the
union, reinstatement of union men
discharged, it is alleged because of
their union activities, and for the right
to meet officials of the company to
request higher wages and better work
ing conditions. William R. Fitzgerald,
general organizer of the Amalgamated
Association of Street and Electric Rail
way Employes, says that If the union
calls a strike on the surface car lines
the men employed on the elevated and
subway routes In Manhattan also will
be called out.

Woman Paroled From Insane
Hospital Seeks Reconcilia

SHE GOES TO SUNBURY
Lunacy Commission Did Not
Meet Her Before Adjudging
Her Insane Members Admit
Mrs. Walter T. Keiner, who yester
day was released on parole from the
Insane hospital at Carlisle, was in Har
risburg to-day seeking a reconciliation
with her husband. This was first veri
fied by her husband who is one of the
proprietors of Hotel Plaza, and later
by an attorney on whim Mrs. Keiner
called this morning. The husband
said:
Mrs. Keiner called me up by tele
phone last night and asked for a con
lerence. She said she was sorry for
what had occurred and wanted to
come back and live with me. 1 told
her that If she had anything to say, it
would have to be told to my attorney.
I was then told by Mrs. Keiner that
she was coming to Harrisburg ami to
me.
"X told her she should not come
here. Following pleas from krg.
Keiner to allow her to go to Philadel
phia, which 1 denied, 1 suggested that
she go to her relatives at Sunbury. The
conversation ended with a statement
that Mrs. Keiner would be in Harris
burg to-day on her way to Sunbury.
1 again refused to see her."
"I do not wish to commit myself at
this time as to future actions, but I
want to say that a full and complete
account ot all money spent out of
Mrs. Keiner's income will pe presented
to the court at the proper time, and I
will request that 1 be discharged from
further duties as guaruian. It was
through a request from the bank at
Sunbury that I took cnarge of the
money for Mrs. Keiner. uther action
may follow as soon as Mrs. Keiner is
released from parole by the court and
adjudged sane."
The attorney corroborated what i
Mr. Keiner said, and told of Mrs. i
Keiner's presence in Harrisburg for'
the purpose of taking up with heri
husband. She told the attorney that
Mr. Keiner had been good to her, and I
that she wanted to go back and live I
with him. Mrs. Keiner made the ap
pointment with the attorney last night
but came to Harrisburg earlier than
was expected, and it is believed left
here for Sunbury about noon.
Attorney J. H. Reiff, one of the
members of the lunacy commission,
said to-day when called by telephone
that he could not recall whether Mrs.
Keiner had a representative at the
hearing but was positive that a legal
notice had been served upon her to be
present or have a representative. He
added, "I talked to Mrs. Keiner a
number of times and gave as my
i opinion that she was not of sound

U. S. Pays $2,920,000,000
of Debt Since War Started
New York, Aug. 17.—Nearly half
the $6,500,000 of world Indebtedness
which the American people owed
when the European war began has
been liquidated in the two years since.
Such, at least, is the estimate made
to-day by leading bankers here, who
have inside sources of information as
to what has taken place.
This estimate cotints as a debt re
duction the offsetting credits which
this country has extended to the world
during the period, including the $250,-
000,000 new British credit which was
publicly offered to-day.
When the war began this country
owed the world on open accounts $40,-

strained to protect international set
