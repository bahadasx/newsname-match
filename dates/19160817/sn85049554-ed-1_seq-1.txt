Berlin, Aug. 17.—A German officer
who, until recently, was aide de camp
in the Lille district of northern France,
has given the Overseas News Agency
service an account of his experience
during the "removal of the civilian
population of Lille," as it has-been al
luded to by the press in hostile coun
tries.
"The main reason fjr sending the
people from Lille," the officer is quot
ed as saying, "was mat the town was
being furiously shelled by the British,
who do not show regard for the French
cities that the French artillery men do.
In addition to this there ha.i been much
difficulty in the distribution of food in
the congested districts of the city.
Therefore civilians from the densely
populated workingmen's quarters were
sent away. By no means all civilians
were sent ortly those from the quar
ters mentioned.
"These civilians were not forced to
leave, but were notified by proclama
tion of free labor awaiting them. It
