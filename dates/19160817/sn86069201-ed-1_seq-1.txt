On Tuesday August 1st, news was

and Mrs. Wm. Hurte Sr, at Lowell,
that their son M. E. Hurte, abrakeman
on the Pennsylvania and Lake Erie
Itailroad, had met his death Monday
evening July 31st near South Heights,
Pa. This was indeed, a sad message
to come to the aged parents, who were
unable to make so long a journey to see
the last of their darling bey.
M. E. Hurte was born in Garrard
county August 20th, 1SS3, and spent
the greater part of his life here. Some
ten or twelve years ago, ho left here
for Pittsburg, Pa, where he was soon
married to Pearl Vernon, eldest daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. George Vernon, of
Nadino Pa. To them were given three
children, who with their mother are
left to mourn the loss of a devoted
father.
He united with the Baptist church in
his young manhood, and held fajt to
this belief to the end. He was a mem
ber of the I. O. 0. F. of Verona, Pa.,
also of the Mechanics of Troy Hill.
Mike was a boy who numbered bis
friends by his acquaintances, and the
high esteem in which he was held was
fully testified by the beautiful floral
tributes, and the many kind messages
of sympathy tendered the bereaved
wife and relatives.
He leaves, besides a wife and three
children, a father, mother, three broth
ers: Sam and Arthur of this county,
Edward of Pittsburg, Pa., anj four
sisters; Mrs. J. S. Ileitis of Pittsburg,
Pa., Mrs. Ancil Parks of Richmond Ky
and Misses Ida and Cora Hurte of this
county.
Funeral services were conducted at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Ver
non, Filday August 4th, by Key. Hack
man, after which all that was mortal
of this splendid young man, was laid to
rest in the Allegheny Cemetery of
Pittsburg Pa., to await the resurrection
morn. May the bereaved and grief
stricken ones look for comfort to "Him
who giveth and who taketh away."
TO THE GARRARD
COUNTY DEMOCRATS.
I I wiili to publicly announce that I will
lie n candidato for the nomination for
Assessor of Garrard county at the Aug'
ust primary 1917 subject to the will of
tho Democrats of Garrard County.
While I have never held public office
of any kind, yet I can submit my can
dldacy to jou with confidence that my
loyalty to our party and active work to
bring success to our nominees for the
past twenty five yea's is so well and
generally known to you that my candi
dacy will claim from you a favorable
consideration.
I believe in party organization, and
all things t eir.g equal, that those who
do the best wcrk for the party and
serve the organization best, should be
honored by the party with the offices.
I am willing to have my claims meas
ured by this test. As you know, I have
never sulked or bolted, and whether
you decide to honor me with the nomi
nation or select a more worthy demo
crat, you will find me in line willing to
do my best for your nominees as I have
done in previous elections. Mr. David
Sanders will be my deputy if nominated
and elected. Your help will be appre
ciated. E. H. KAY.
SECRETARY WILSON
To Be Labor Day Speaker At Lexington.
The Dlue Grass Federation of Labor
is arranging for a big celebration at
Lexington Septemper 2nd. when Hon
orable W. B. Wilson Secretary of Labor
in President Wilson's cabinet will
deliver the principal address at 7:30
that evening. There will be other
speakers and a great time is anticipated.
A general invitation is extended to
the public and all organizations of
labor.
ORDER SUSPENDED
Kentucky Troops Not To Go To Border.
Orders for the remaining mobilized
units of the National Guard to proceed
to the border have been suspended by
the War Department. No official
explanation has been made, but it is
known that the delicacy of the railroad
strike situation has be in the moving
consideration.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, which would have moved some
25,000 men to the border, should not be
taken as an indication that the Pres
ident's negotiations with the railroad
brotherhoods and the railroad managers
have taken an unfavorable turn, but is
a measure of caution.
It was considered highly undesirable
that all the remaining guardsmen
should be moved to the border while
there was a possibility of a railroad
strike, which they might be called upon
to preserve order throughout some of
the States. There is even the
possibility that some of the troops, in
the event of a strike, might be called
upon to guard or operate mail trains
supplying the troops already on border.
The suspension of the orders prevents
the immediate movement of the troops
from Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont,
and the movement of all other mobilized
units which were to have gone forward
soon as they were equipped. Some
of the Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont
troops were nbont ready to go to the
border.
TO THE DEMOCRATS
OF GARRARD COUNTY;
I hae accepted theCounty Campaign
Chairmanship for Garrard County and
propose to give it my earnest and hear
ty support and ask the co-operation of
every Democrat in the County who en
dorses the policies of President Wilson
and desires his re-election to aid in roll
ing up a handsome majority in old Gar
rard. We hope at a very early date to
see a complete organization in every
precinct in the County. There is no
doubt but that our political enemies are
making strenuous efforts to carry the
State for Hughes but with vour earnest
support with me in this work we will
hold this County in the Democratic col
umn, and see anoverwhelmlng majority
in November. With no political fac
tions in Kentucky, sentiment in favor
of a great Democratic victory grows
brighter every day. Never before in
the history of the party has there been
less dissension.
We expect the vote In this county of
those Republicans who place the
National Honor above party success,
and of those Progressives who retuse
to go back to the boss ridden party
which they repudiated In 1912.
The Democratic party asks for an
endorsement of the Wilson administra
tion. If you approve of the course
which the President has followed, the
party expects your support.
Very truly yours.

OPENING OF DEMO
CRATIC HEADQUARTERS.
Large Attendance And Great Enthusiasm
Displayed.
State Campaign Chairman J. Camp
bell Cantrill, opened heedquarters at
Seelbach s. Louisville, Monday, when
if any donbts were entertainad of the
enthusiasm of Kentucky Democrats for
Wilson and Marshall they were dispelled
and a determination was evinced to
carry the State by such a majority as
will settle its politicial status for years
to come.
The quarters embrace a number of
large rooms on the tenth floor of the
hotel, which had been handsomely
decorated with flags, bunting and
other ornaments, embellished by large
pictures of the presidential nominees.
Senators James and Beckham, the
party's nominees for congress and
Mayor Buschmeyer. They were
crowded all day with men who came
from all seotions of the State to do
honor to the occasion and to register
their hecrty approval of the selection
of Chairman Cantrill for tbe important
and difficult position, and it was the
unanimous opinion that he was the
right man in the right place and that
his efforts lo bring all factions
to-gether would result in the elimination
of Kentucky from the so-called doubt
ful column, leaving no leg for the
boastful republicans to stand upon in
their claim for supremacy in the state.
Reports from all the districts now
held by democrats were full of comfort
and joy and showed that the party is
fully alive to the importance of
re-electing Wilson and the nominees
for congress, who are ably supporting
him in his efforts to faithfully serve a
common country, and the indications
aro that the delegation will remain as
it is, if not indeed there is one addition.
Among the democrats in attendance
were Gov, A. 0. Stanley, Lieut. Gov.
Jas. B. Black, with many of the state
officials, Congressman Harvey Helm of
th eighth c'istrict. Chairman Chas. A.
Harden ot Harrodsburg with members
of the state and executives committees.
Mayor J. H. Buschmever, the city
officials and many other Louisville
citizens, Representatives and prom
inent men generally. The gathering
was a real love feast and all went
away feeling that victory Is In the air
and determined that they will leave
nothing undone to thoroughly redeem
the state.
It was most gratifying aud auspicious
opening of a campaign that is sure to
result in the election of Wilson and
Marshall and insure to the country four
more years of peace, plenty and pro,
peritv.

CROP REPORTS FOP JULY.
The July crop report from the office
of Mat S. Cohen, Commissioner of
Agriculture, show that all crops are
badly needing rain, and unless they get
it soon they will be materially damaged.
This is the case In some sections more
than others. Showers which have been
falling have been local, reaching some
counties, while the adjoining counties
did not get any. The temperature has
been high along with the dryness, which
has been harder on the growing crops.
About one or one half inches of rain
would make a wonderful difference on
the condition ot crops at this time.
The averaga yield of grain been small.
the average for the state being nine
bushels per acre for wheat, ten for rye
and seventeen for oats. The hay crops
have turned out very good, especially
alfalfa. The average for the second
crop of alfalfa wasone and one-half tons
per acre. All grasses eem to be good,
and unless cut off by continued drought
will furnish good pasture all summer.
The prospects for a good fruit crop are
very poor. There will probably be
about a half normal crop. Poultry of
all kinds is reported as being in good
condition, and there is very little dis
ease over the State. Little hog chol
era exists in the State at this time,
and a hard fight will be made to keep
it under control. The Bourbon County
Breeders are handling the problem
more systematically than any other sec
tion of the State.
