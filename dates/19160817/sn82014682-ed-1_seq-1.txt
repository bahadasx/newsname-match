; Lawyer Urges for War
(Special Cablegram to Hawaii Shinno)
TOKIO, August 17. Under instruc
tion from his government. Minister
Hayashi at Peking has begun nego
tiations with the Chinese government
today on the question of the Chinese
soldiers at Cheng-chia-tuh, who at
tacked the Japanese garrison. Minis
ter Hayashi officially informed the
Chinese government that Japan will
be compelled to , reinforce her garri
son on account of want of confidence
in Chinese soldiers.
Upon careful examination the cas
ualties are found to be: 7 soldiers, 2
corporals and 1 policeman killed and
4 soldiers and 1 corporal wounded.
Lieut Matsuo, : who commanded the
garrison, was not killed as reported,
but is fatally wounded.

Civic Organizations, Officials

Honolulu is today re"llziug for Abi

hope that she expressed in her letter
to the Star-Bulletin that the people ofr
Hawaii would support ner errorts to f0r tHe ap pointment, or reinstatement,

wiJl be presented by Mayor Lane to mcus ntigntion which, on Wednesday,

and forwarding te the secretary of the b virtue cf a decision by the supreme
navy. Civic organizations are als COUrt

prominence and influence will support the opinion that Kuhio has no con
her proposal. '! necticn with the case as a Party plain-
Although it develops that In accord
ance with present customs a battle
ship could hardly be named Hawaii,
the modern fast and formidable battle
cruisers are eligible for the honor.
The ruling ha3 been that battleships
are to be named' after states. It is
claimed that ' Hawaii not having at
tained statehood h not in line for the
naming of such Vessel but is eligible
for vessels of the cruiser type and
classes. This point was raised by
Raymond C. Brown and by Charles R.
Fcrbes. Neither of them opposed the
proposal of the .'princess but on the
contrary offered ihe amendment that
Hawaii seek the best obtainable.
Mayor Lane received the advices of
what Princess David Kawananakoa
has done in Wurfngtnn with enthusi
asm and said that he would do all in
his nower to bring about the end she
desires and would use his personal
and official influence to do so. He
then promised to have drafted resolu
tions an the subject for presentation
to the oupervisors at their meeting to
night and to bo sent to the secretary
of the navy following adoption.
Raymond C Brown said that this
was not the first time the matter had
been considered but that he was con
fident the chamber of commerce
would support it and would have its
representative in Washington call per
sonally on the secretary of the navy
and urge the naming of a cruiser of
the most modern type Hawaii.

is the first one to be placed in con

LANAI ISL
Trip Declared to Have ' Been
One of Pleasure Only and
Not Business
"The results of our trip to Lanai?"
repeated R. W. Shingle of the Henry
Waterhouse -Trust Co. "Oh, we had
a fine time went fishing, visited Mo
Ickini; went swimming every day;
had the best vacation in years?"
'Was the island sold? Where did
you get that Idea? No one has asked
us to sell them the island. It was a.
purely pleasure trip. I wasn't trying
to sell anything. There are no nego
tiations on that I know of."
Thus he disposed of rue rumor
printed when the party left that H. J.
Lcrentzen has an option on the prop
erty for $1,000,000. Lorentzen was one
of the party and the fact that he
made an offer for A. M. Brown's inter
est in the Cornwell ranch before it
was sold lent color to the rumor.
W. B. Pittm'an, a brother of Senator
Key Pittman of Nevada, was also one
cf the party. It was rumored that the
Nevada senator, having made a great
deal of money in tungsten since the
war began, was looking for a place
to invest it when hearing of the op
portunities for i vesting it in Lanai
ranch property he sent his brother to
investigate.
But Shingle denied this.
. Asked abcut the statement of James
Woods, representative f the St. Fran
cis Hotel interests, who visited here.
that the Beckley property, has been
selected as the site for a hotel to be
erected by local capitalists, of whom
Shingle was named as one, he refused
to reply aefinitely. "I am not ready
to say yet." he declared. "We have
not bought the Beckley property, nor
have we an option on it."

that the Beckley site had been select

Later he presented hisres!gnation to
the governor and it was accepted. He
considered ' that this was final and
ended his being a public officeholder.
On the other hand there are lawyers
who contend that under the organic
act the governor has not the power to
accept the resignation of a member
of the legislature and that hence the
resignation was inoperative and inef
fective. This phase of the matter is

It is understood that Bitting has re

Police Surgeon R. GV Ayer, who has
