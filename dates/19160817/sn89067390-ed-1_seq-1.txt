outside of his own county and did not

' he got ih usands of votes. He even
nicked up s wethiog like four thou

A still more s riking fact is that, in
every county in the state, Democrats
scratched ofl ol the primary ballot all

The patent medicines manufactured
in this country are valued at more than
$14,000,000 annually, and we import
almost $500,000,000 worth of drugs
and medicines a year. It is impossible
that this much medicine is needf d in
the country. A large amount is taken
without the advice of a physician, and
without any clear diagnosis having
been made as to illness. It stands to
reason that any drug that is strong
enough to produce marked effects of a
cutative nature, must produce bad
effects on the body when taken in
large doses or over a long period of
time.
Th:s dependence ondrugsisirration
al. Drugs are powerful, and should be
taken only on the advice of those who
have made a study of their actions and
uses. Under such conditions a much
smaller quantity of drugs would be
taken because all physicians realize
that drugs cannot cure most diseases,
however useful thej may be in alleviat
ing symptoms and assisting uature to
to the desired end.
Especially to be avoided are those
medicines containing alcohol, opium
or other habit-forming drugs. We are
using less ol these than we were a few
years ago, but we are still using more
than we should.
In some states every remedy sold
for the treatment of live stock must
have on its label the name of every
active drug in it. Also the term "live
stock remedy" is not allowed to in
clude patent medicine primairly intend
ed for human beings but sometimes
used for animals. Therefore if the
farmer wishes to give medicine to his
pigs with safety he must be careful to
do so with a remedy put out for pigs
and not for his baby, because in this
case there is no requirement . that the
active ingredients be put on the label
Is it not curious that we take better
care of our animals than we do of om
children?

A Better Oat Crop for Next Year
-V f 'LA
Was your oat crop satisfactory this
year? Or was it so poor that you are
thinkiug of not planting it again?
The oat crop has yielded so little in
the past lew years in Missouri that
farmers in the state are beginning to
abandon in cultivation. But the place
of oats as a food for horses and young
stock and as a factor in rotation is
still important enough to justify its
production in the opinion ol the Ex
periment Station of the College of Ag
riculture of the University of Missouri.
The factors which determine the pro
fitable growing of oats in this state says
a bulletin, "Factors influencing the
Yield of Oits," are the use of the best
adapted varieties, fanning of seed to
prevent running out, better preparation
ol ground, drilling instead ol broad
casting, early seeding and the pre
vention of the smut by the formalin
treatment.
The best varieties arc: White Si

Dakota, Black Jt acetic, Martinsburg,
NichoU', Black Comet, Victor; Red

He is a Young Oil Man
How agreeably surprised were the
people when they saw Judge Lamm.
Instead of a bent, gray-haired, infirm
old man, walking with a cane, they
saw standing before them a husky six
footer, straight as an arrow, with broad,
powerful shoulders. He walked with
the springy step of youth and on the
platform he spoke with the vigor and
entnusiasrn of a man of 40. There
are few wrinkles in his slightly florid
face, and his reddish hair and mustache
are pnly partly gray.
I: is sufficient to say that every
where Judge Lamm went and that
v in the strongholds of the enemy
ie won the support oi the people, lor
-e carried most of the counties that
ne visited. The impression that he
was to be barred irom the governor
ship on account of his age was dissi
pated, and counties where, a few weeks
ago, the politicians said he would get
no votes turned out enthusiastically
lor him and gave him a Substantial
majority over his opponents. Post
