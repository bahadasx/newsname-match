BUSINESS FOR EVERBODY
Kase with Which a Practical Riisi-
ness Education fan lie Secured

Under the present industrial ami
. oomtnerclal systems t hat prevail in
this country, everybody should havt
a knowledge of the fundamental
principles that underlie business
transactions and understand book
keeping which is a systematic record
of them.
There was a time when it was
commonly" supposed that only a sel
ect few could know how to "kce,
books", but limes have changed in
this respect and we fully believe will
cbange more within the next few
years. There is coming to be niort
of u need for persons who are not
professional bookkeepers, and neve
expect to even engage in clerical
work, to be able to keep a record o
business transactions and affairs t It a

Alliance Business ami Professional
Men (live Their Kndornement
to Canimign for Funds
PROMISE TO SUPPORT CAMPAIGN
The committee appointed to Inter
view the business men and others of
the city regarding their opinion of
St. Joseph's hospital and the cam
paign for funds for the new Duiiding
have met with remarkable success.
Practically every citizen interviewed
has had good words for the project.
We print below a few of the. inter
views secured during the past week.
Others will be published later.
Roy Beckwlth, proprietor of ihe
Right clothing store: "An enlarged
hospital will be a great benefit for
humanity in this pare of western Ne
braska. , I speak from personal ex
perience In the matter and feel
grateful for Its presence In our
midst."
George Fleming, cigar and news
stand: "You bot your life, a hospital
is a good thing."
J. C. Morrow, receiver U. S. Land
ice: "The hospital is a good thing
and an Institution in which every
one should be interested."
James 11. H. Hewitt, chief clerk,
U. S. land office: "There is no ques
tion that it is a good thing from ev
ery standpoint to have ample hospit
al facilities in every community, iho
growing needs of every western com
munity must be fully provided for."
Robert Graham, postmaster, when
interviewed expressed u great deal
of interest in the matter, especially
regarding the growth and develop
ment of the Institution since its Btart.
He slated that he would like to see
a larger hospital, as Institutions of
this kind are few and far between in
western Nebraska. From the hu-
humanitariun point of view it is a
great benefit to all the people In this
portion of the state and especially to
ihe people of Alliance.
A. T. Lunn, cashier of NewDerrys
Hardware Company: "There is no
question of the neod of a hospital in
this community. It certainly has
proved its great need."
Lee Basye, county attorney: 1
think it is necessary not only to the
city but to this part of the state lit
which we live and we certainly have
a well qualified management of its
affairs. ' :
H. A. Dubuque, proprietor of tin
Imperial: "There can be no question
of the value of the hospital to the
community, both from the commun
ity and humanitarian standpoint.
L. II. Highland, grocer: "Every
citizen of Alliance is fully aware thai
the present facilities of the hospital
are inadequate to meet the demand
of the city and surrounding ccunliy.
There is great need for the enlarge
ment of the present hospital.
Colonel Evans, veteran of the civil
war: "We are in need of an enlarged
hospital."
Capt. S. P. Tuttle. veteran of the
civil war: "A hospital is needed and
very one is forced to recognize the
beneficial fruits of such an institu
tion." L. A. Berry, county judge: "A hos
pital of the character of the one here
in Alliance is certainly needed and
we all hnve felt its beneficial effects."
T. S. Fielding, tailor: "St. Joseph's
hospital Is all nut lit."
Marcus Frankle, proprietor of The
Famous clothing store: "The hospit
al is certainly a benefit to the city or
Alliance, but above all things a ncc
. x;n nenefif to humanity."
George A. Mollri'ig. proprietor of
Mollring's dry goods store: "One has
,o recognize that a hospital Is bene
ficial to this coin . uiw.) in which we
!ive in more ways tltnii one. This b
i self-evident fact."
.1. II. Yaughi. n. of Vaugban K
on: "I am in favor of any public or-
:ar.lz.ttion thru will benefit the com
munity. And the hospital is cer
tainly a beneficial institution."
A. V. Gavin, chief dispatcher Bur
ington railroad: "I know from per
sonal "Xperlence that the hospital Ik
loing an excellent work. I'nfortun
it.ely we find it necessary to send
.ome of our employes there and I
;ini quite safe in saying that ninety-
five per cent of them have nothing
but tlie highest regard for the devo-
tiori and efficiency of the sisters
Very few have made any complaints
hid we all feel that this is an effici
ent organization. So far as we are
(oncerned, I think I am safe in say
ing that everything is satlcfactory. It
will be an enlarged work for buinati-
ty and as such It ought to receive
i ne generous support oi uie
com-
nunity that depends upon It.

lug the Use of Dimmers to
Prevent Accidents
At the meeting of the city council
held Tuesday evening the city attor
ney was instructed to draw up an
ordinance requiring the use of dim
mers on auto lights In the rlty. The
use of strong, glaring headlights Is
the cause of many accidents and the
council will see taht this danger la
avoided.
The proposition of placing light
poles or standards at the street In
tersections on Box Butte avenue, at
Second, Third and Fourth streets
was taken up and will be acted upon
at the next meeting of the council.
This would avoid cutting corners
and assist tn making autolsti ob
serve the traffic regulations.

pointed to fill this vacancy.
Improvement district number nine

ance number 224. This ordinance

ald this week.

Company 3, 18th Infantry Reserves
who has been employed at the pot
ash plant at Antloeh, received notice
Sunday noon on train No. 43 to re
port at once at Fort Riley, Kansas
The notice was accompanied by an
order for his transportation. The or
der was dated August 10.
Gilbert Joined the army December
1. 1912. and was mustered out In
October of last year. He did . noi
know .the reason for tho call but left
on the first train after receiving it,
which was Monthly noon.
Orders were Issued the first of the
week by the war department to semi
all national guard organizations to
the bonier without delay. These or
ders were rescinded two days latei
without renson being given thuiefor.

W. Nation, one mile southeast of Al

gation purposes, half of the expense

Ken feet. Boring was continued

DUNBAR AND LEWIS
ARE THE ROBBERS
Hoys Arretted for Breaking Into
Freight Car Prove to be the
1 lot Men Store Robbers
Orvllle Lewis and Willie Dunbar,
arrested by Marshal Wheeler the
first of the week for breaking Into a
box car In the Burlington yards, have
proven to be the burglars who broke
a plate glass window In the Holsten
drug and Jewelry store on August 6
and got away with watches, rings
and stickpins to the value of $200.
The boys entered a house In east
Alliance and attacked the woman of
the house, tearing her clothing from
her body and causing a general row.
Later they broke Into a box car and
got away with eight macklnaw coats
aud other clothing. The clothing
was recovered by Chief of Tollce
Jeffers In the Vaughan & Son coal
yards, where they had hidden them
under piles of coal. The chief was
unable to locate the bad boys and
kthey were arrested by Marshal
Wheeler the next day.
The boys were lodged in the coun
ty Jail and while there Sheriff Cul
Cox discovered some of the stolen
Jewelry on them from the Holsten
store. He secured a confession from
them. They acknowledged breaking
the window In the Holsten store and
stealing the Jewelry. Only a part of
the Jewelry was In their possession.
They took the sheriff to Antioch
Wednesday afternoon and more of
the Jewelry was recovered thero from
a party to whom they had sold It.
Most of the missing articles have
been recovered.
Dunbar is now on parole from the
state refronintosy. Both boys have
been In trouble before. Their pres
ent crimes will probably land them
behind the bars for long sentences.

NEW CLUB SECRETARY
IS NOW ON THE JOB
II. M. Ilushnell, Jr., of Lincoln Take
Up Dutiea of Alliance (Jommer
clal Club Secretary
H. M. Bushnell, Jr., of Lincoln, a
graduate of the law department or
the state university and a young man
of energy and pleasing appearance,
arrived Monday to take up the duties
of secretary of the Alliance Commer
cial Club. v
In response to a request of Tho
Herald for an Interview regarding
his plans for the work here, his Im
pression of Alliance and Its commer
cial club, and bis opinion of commer
cial club work In general, Mr. Bush
nell made the following statement:
"My Initial impression is most ex
cellent and especially am 1 pleased
with the personnel of the board of
directors of the club and the num
erous members I have mot. They
seem cognizant of the large factors
in community development. Eman
cipated from petty prejudices they
approach the tasks with an admira
ble spirit of progress that bodes well
for the future of tho club. It Was
because of this same spirit that Alli
ance has advanced to Its present
prosperity and that Identical attitude
will bo the power that will accom
plish even more In the future.
"Since coming to Alliance many
have inquired of me, 'What are your
plans?' I could onl7 answer, 'Noth
ing definite at thlB time." For a nov
ice In the community to formulate In
advance definite and concrete Ideas
would be but to deter and hamper
the work. Rather do I prefer to
come here open-minded, with a spirit
of seeking out conditions, studying
the members and then from time to
time eonaumate concise plans. In
general I can say that I contemplate
no radical change from the policy of
the former secretary, Mr. Fisher. I
shall give Alliance all possible pub
licity In every way; shall push good
roatls until Box Butte county Is a
criterion In that respect. Every lo
cal enterprise will be encouraged
and new business concerns aided In
establishing themselves here. The
paramount need In this territory Is
more people for the land and it bo
hooves not only tho Commercial
Club but all citizens to hold forth
every Inducement for new settlers.
From a civic standpoint there are in
numerable factors that deserve aid.
And so along with the upbuilding of
the'ci's buslnes let-ns nofc be Jin-
mindful f the wants of the public.
"There is an evil that Is beginning
to display Itself In a few scattered
commercial clubs. That Is tbeafuic
t Ion of Injudicious expenditure of
funds, or to ue a harsh word ex-.
trnvagnnco. -Le)- nitr hot leave the
in pression that 'closonoss' Is a vir
tue for I am a confirmed disciple to
the doctrine that nothing Is so Im
portant to a club ss solid finances
aud ample funds to carry on the
work. You can take out In returns
only In proportion to what you put
in, so therefore the more money the
more results, so long as the funds
are properly expended. What I de
sire Is an Investing of all funds In
such a manner as to assure the max
imum returns. It Is the principle of
pecuniary efficiency. '
"My personal desire in the begin
ning is to become Intimately ac
quainted with all the members. Af
fability is an antidote to misunder
stand and 'talkabillty' (not talka
tiveness) is something that will as
sure concerted action among all. It
Is a 'cedium through which I can de
termine the wants and Ideas of the
individuals and from that source
promote plans that will be In sub
stantial accord with all the members.
I desire to know everyone and to
command the confidence of all.
"I am sure that it will prove not
oi ly a pleasure but also an Inspira
tion to be connected with such an ac
tive bntly of men as this club. I
shall endeavor to ever promote the
interests of Alliance, Box , Butte
county and western Nebraska and do
everything in my ptTwer to make
matters a success."
Mr. iiusnneii can De round at tne
Commercial Club offiae In the base
ment of the Alliance National Bank

club members drop In and get ac
quainted witb him when onnortunitr
