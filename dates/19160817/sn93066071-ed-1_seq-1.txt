VALUABLE IMPROVEMENT FOR BEAVER
We note with pleasure the comple
tion and operation of the Heaver ice
plant, lc in a valuable Improvement
tor Heaver nnil one which should be
patronized by all who believe in town
tmorovement nnd development. Very
few Jowns the size of Heaver can boast
of such an institution and it required
considerable faith In the town and no
little expenditure of money on the
part of thii proprietor, 8. N. Wlble, to
establish sucli a plnnt. In the past
Beaver people have been compu'led to
jiay nil the nor from 70 cents to U'.OO
per hundred for Ice and at times the;
could not get It at any price. Now,
since the establishment of the ice
plant) we may get it delivered to our
door for from CO tu 7 cents and we can
Ret It when we need It.
We understand that a foreign con
cent, in order to put the Heaver plain
jiuf of business and re-establish high
prices, has made a decided cut In
prices since the operation of the plant
lieia and we are sorry to also be in
formed that a few business concerns
here nrjs patronizing the outside house.
In our opliifon this is not showing the
proper loyalty to home industry nnd
should be discouraged. If tills concern
can now sell ice at such a low rate,
uiy did it not do so before the opera
tion of the Denver plant? If by cut
ting prices tielow cost of production
and closing up the Heater plant, have
Beaver people any assurance that they
would continue to sell their ice at the
low prices ottered now? Not by any
means. The Beaver plant would no
sooner shut, Its doors than we would be
paying the sumo old high prices again.
We believe that Mr. Wible is honest
and honorable and that Mo will con
tinue to supply Beaver with ice at a
price consistent with good business
and so long as he does this, he should
receive the support and patronage of
every citizen of Beuver. ''Buy It at
home," is our slogan.
GRADE SCHOOL TO HAVE NEW BUILDING
The contract was let this week for a
new brick school building for the'grade
xchool. Contractor W. F. Shaw was
the successful bidder Work will com
mence at once and it Is hoped to have
the building ready for use after the
holidays. The building will be erected
orr'th6'PreSfcnt- gfaUe'ecKopl sitonmP'
will be two-story with basement. The
nrrungement of tne plan Is for a gym
nasium, play-room and boiler-room in
the basement; four class rooms on the
first Moor; two class rooms, tin assemb
ly room, which may bo converted Into
two class rooms, nnd the superintend
cut's olllce on the second tluur..
A new building for tiie grades has
long lieen a necessity for the old build
ing was not inly inadequate but was
not altogether safe and the fact that u
new building 1b to be evected will Lu
received with delight by the children
an well as the patrons and all those in
terested in the schools.
Hepresentative H. M. Drake, of
DombeyMand the republican nomineo
for re-election from this district, was
a Beaver visitor Saturday. While here
ne caiieu at tne neraiu oinco and we
learned from him that crop conditions
are very much the same in his section
lis around Heaver. While the wheat
crop uaa short, averaging from ten to
twelve bushels per acre, though in
some instances a high as twenty-two
bushels was produced, yet the quality
was good and ,1s bringing top prices.
Fall crops will bo short "but if frost
holds oil considerable maize and kallr
enough for roughness and winter
grain will be produced. He tells us
that land continues to chauge haude,
George Kyser having sold recently to
E. it. Sherrlll and Wulter Parmalee
purchased the' Tom Hoy farm. Hoy
and Kyser will move to Texas, where
they have both secured land. Another
event of the Dombey neighborhood,
particularly of Interest to Mr, and Mrs.
Alex Urhhmage, was a visit of the stork
to their home the 6th, when a Liaby girl
came to blest) their household. Mr.
Drake also tells us that there is some
oil agitation in his neighborhood and
that land is beiug leased to put down
a test well. An Oklahoma City con
corn Is interested and has agreed to
put down the test well If -1,000 acres of,
land cari be leased for them. It looks
like it should be an easy matter to se
cure a lease on that much land for
that purpose. Anyone who owns land
fn that vicinity could scarcely afford
not to lease their land for the increase
in value should oil or gas be found
would be enormous. We trust that
Mr. Drake may be able to secure suf
ficient acreage and that the test may
be made, It la the general opinion
that oil or gas or both exists in this
county and we would llkesee thor
ough tests made in the Dombey neighborhood.

High school

Thu school board have used their
usual good judgment in the selection
of toauhers for another year and there
is eyery reason to believe that our
schools for 11)10-17 will bu fully up to
the high standard of excellence which
thoy have maintained in tne past.
Six of the teachers were with us last
year and proved their ability to such
an extent that thu patrons of the dis
trict tvero well pleased when it was
known that they had been retained.
The four additions to the faculty we
are sure have been selected with care
and with the best interest of the
schools in mind and we have every rea
son to believe that they will make
good.
Beaver can justly point with pride
to its' excellent school t) stent-. It
stands without n- peer in tho county
and (n fact, very few schools of thu
Southwest have reached our class

SLIGhTAUlO ACCIDENT
A Blight nuto accident, which luckily
did not terminate seriously occurred on
thu street Saturday when Hill Price
proceeded to try to drive his Ford over
Jim Provost or Provost tried to walk
over the Ford. Mr. Provost sustained
a slightly bruised and sprained ankle.
While this accident was only slight
yet, it should be enough to cause auto
drivers as well as pedestrians on the
streets to use greater care. KverjjOuy
we note instances of reckless driving
on nur streets which could very easily
terminate tcrlodtlf.' Why not use &
little more care? Ilettdr bu safe than
sorry. i
