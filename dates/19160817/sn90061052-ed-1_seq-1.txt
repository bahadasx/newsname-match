A Ffarik Statement
All over the Unlteil States news
paper publisher are facing difficulties
greater thup Uley were ever before
called upon to Incet These troubles
arecmbanisdngtiie liirqcst newspapers
in the country and the smallest as well
and probably the country publisher is
Hie hardent lilt because of lack ofor
ganlmtlon and vpry much less oppor
tunity to ctetidhis business
The difllculty is in the unprecedent
ed high price of paper and supplies of
all kinds and added to the high price
of newsprint paper Unit particular paper
is hard to get at any price
Nearly all the big papers and many
smaller ones arc increasing the sub
scription price and tit the same time
are cutling down the size of the paperB
and eliminating and condensing news
features
The publisher hereof is feeling the
strain of present conditions more than
anyone else than himself realizes
More than a moij th ago we paid over
the counter in Kansas City to 177 for
a ton of paper and up to this date we
hove received but 17 reams of it about
one third of the paper paid for The
wholesale house claims they cant get
the stock from the mills A year ago
we bought a much better grade of pa
per at the rate of about G0 a ton and
bought as muchorus little us suited
our needs
Wo are making the very besi prices
wecan foradvertlslngand Job printing
but if customed notice an increase in
the price ofeUherwe hope they -will
take into consideration the condition
which confronts us
We mailed thla week 112 notices to
subscribers calling attention to unpaid
subscriptions many of them having
run over but a short time and we hope
to receive prompt remittance from the
friends and subscribers to whom the
notices were sent The payment of
subscriptions promptly will very
matcrliilly help us to meet the con
dition we face
