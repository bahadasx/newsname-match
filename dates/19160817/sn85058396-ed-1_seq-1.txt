(tion and besides are menacing the

ONlHE TARIFF
Declares American Working
Men Cannot Compete With
the Outside World.
Portland, Ore., Aug. 1G. Charles
E. Hughes, before a large audience in
the ice rink here tonight, assailed
! the Democratic party for its policy
toward the Philippines.
"We cannot afford in' this country
to lose sight of national obligations,"
Mr. Hughes said. "Our friends on the
other side were almost ready to say
that we should abandon tho Philip
pines. That was a matter of na
tional honor. We assumed obligations
there which we are bound to dis
charge. "It Is not so much a matter of self
interest. I do not care so much with
respect to the argument of self-interest.
But when this nation under
takes before the world a responsl-1
bility, it must discharge it.
Would Not Scuttle.
"And we ought not td consider tho
suggestion of scuttling out of the
Philippines to leave them In tho pre
dicament which you know 'perfectly
well without my describing it.
"We need more of a sense of obli
gation, as individuals. If we have
the sense of national honor, a domi
nant consciousness of national unity,
a proper upbuilding of American en
terprise, we shall do well, but we need
still more. Wo need throughout our
administrative departments high
standards of public work. We need
efficiency in every department of
American government."
Takes Up the Tariff.
Mr. Hughes, speaking of the tariff,
referred to a letter written, he said,
by "an eminent Democrat," on July
2S, to the president of the Illinois
Manufacturers' association, In which
it was said that "It ought to be pos
sible to make the question of duties
merely a suestlon of progress and de
velopment." "I don't care whether this letter
is authentic or not," Mr. Hughes
said. "If it is not authentic then the
provision of law is little more than a
sham. If it is authentic, It does not
represent the sentiment of the Demo
cratic party."
The nominee reiterated his argu
ments for a protective tariff, for com
mercial preparation for competition
with Europe after the war, for "rea
sonable, adequate preparedness," and
repeated his declaration that the
Democratic party was opposed to na
tional progress.
Cemetery Monuments.
"Why, if i WQre a member of that
party and I speak with all good na
ture, because we are threshing things
out here now and looked through the
platforms of the past, I should feel
that I was going through n cemetory
richly embellished with monuments."
Mr. Hughes referred to tho number
of unemployed in 1914, duo' largely,
he said, to the Underwood tariff.
"They know why they wero unem
ployed," he said. "Every one of them
was a tariff expert. There were 300,
000 unemployed tariff exports In the
city of Now York alone.
, "You can't put American working!
men alongside working men of other
countries who work at less wages and
expect tho American working men to
survive. You have got to get down
to tho common basis of competition.
It Is perfectly idle tb suppose you
can have the American wage scale
and the American standard of goods
and let in goods made under a lower
standard of living without hurting.
American enterprises and American
working men."
Refers to Alaska.
In reference to Alaska, Hr. Hughes
said:
"I would not have much confidence
in speaking of a new spirit in Ameri
can life if I did not believe in the in
tegrity of the business men of Ameri
ca. I believe that we can do things
right in this country and develop our
resources. You have got an empire
in Alaska; I want to see it developed.
I want to see it developed right.
"I think the time has come when
we have got to be sure of ourselves,
sure of our integrity confident and
equal to our emergencies.
"I have had something to do in my
life with correcting and preventing
abuses In connection with public mat
ters, and I tell you now, my friends,
that whether I speak of Alaska or
whether I speak of the tariff, no one
Is going to pull anything out at the
public expense if I can prevent it.
Not Afraid of Test.
"It I am charged with the high of
fice for which I am a candidate,"
Mr. Hughes said in closing, "to put
my principles to the test, I am not
afraid of the test. I know what it
means, but, my friends of Oregon
you who mandamused me and made
me become a candidate at the prim
ary against my will I have left the
bench to undertake the active work
of this campaign with but one ambi
tion. "It is not an ambition to hold high
office. That has no illusions for mo.
But I have the amoition to try, so
far as within me lies, to have effi
cient American government worthy
of America's best capacity, and
America's name honored throughout
tho world."
Mr. Hughes left late tonight for
San Francisco, where he Is due to ar
rive Friday at 12:30 p. m.

PRESIDENT OUTLINES PLAN OF I
SETTLEMENT TO BROTHERHOODS I
Eight-Hour Day With Creation of Commission by Congress
and the President to Investigate Working Out of the
Eight-Hour Day and Collateral Issues Men Retire
to Vote and Will Send Result to Wilson
President Explains His Plan in Detail and
Urges Its Acceptance for the Good
of the Country.
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today outlined to the general
committee of railroad employes his
plan for settlement of the threatened
general strike based on acceptance of i
an eight-hour working day and crea
tion of a commission by congress and
the president to investigate the work
ing of the eight-hour day and collat
eral issues.
Administration officials were un
able to determine by the attitude of
the men as they heard the plan
whether they would accept it, but
there was a general expectation that
at least Its principle would be agreed
to. The same plan will be presented
io the presidents of the railroads to
morrow. Under the president's plan the dou
ble compensation propostion would
be eliminated. The eight-hour day
would carry ten hours pay as the
present rate.
"The president's propositions," said
one of tho brotherhood leaders, "is
far and square and the men would be
fools not to accept it."
It was understood that under the
president's plan, the eight-hour day
would go Into effect pending the out
come of the investigation. The com
mission would be a small one, practic
ally composed of three members and
would have authority to summon wit
nesses and determine all of the facts
-on--the.-costtO'-thej.raiIroadsHrOf the
eight-hour day.
After leaving the White House the
men went to their hall to discuss ,the
proposal and take a vote on it. It
was said they probably would reach
a decision tonight and that the presi
dent would have it in his hands when
he meets the railroad presidents tomorrow.
Men March to White House.
The 640 Brotherhood men held a
secret meeting today, lasting a little
more than an hour, then marched in
a body to tho White House. The day
was hot and the men, many of them
stripping orf their coats, took the
shady side of Pennsylvania avenue.
They made quite a column as they
marched along to the treasury build
ing, where they assembled in a mili
tary order and then proceeded to tho
White House, where they went to the
East Room. They planned to meet
again soon after seeing tho presi
dent. Just at 4 o'clock the brotherhood
representatives finished their confer
ence with the president and went to
their hall to vote on tho president's
plan.
The employes heard the presidents
plan without demonstration and said
they would send word to the White
House as soon as possible as to their
decision.
After the meeting A. B. Garretson
refused to comment and declared the
decision of the men would be given
out at the White House if at all.
The president did most of the talk
ing at the meeting, explaining his
plan In detail and urging that it be
accepted for the good of the country.
Afterward Mr. Garretson and W. S.
Stone of the engineers, spoke
briefly.' ,
At the conclusion of the discussion
all of the men formed in line and
shook hands with the president be
fore leaving.
Will Call Owners.
In case President Wilson finds that
any of the railroad presidents cannot
speak absolutely for their roads, ho
may invite to the White House the
financiers who control them. Officials
said today that the president wants
to deal with the "ultimate authority"
on both sides, in order that negotia
tions may bo considered here.
The feeling prevailed that the atti
tude of the railroad heads was now
the same as tho managers' commit
tee. The railroad presidents are ex
pected to mako a strong plea for pre
ervation of tho principle of arbitra
tion and will express their fear that
if the present difficulty cannot be
settled without it, there is little . hdpe
of its being successful In the fu
ture. Another indication of the delicacA
of tho situation was seen In the de-'
clslon at the White House not to
make public the president's remarks
to the men, at this time at 'least. It
was first intended to publish tho
president's statement nnd then his
statement to the managers, thus lay
ing the case before the high court of
public opinion.
Judge Chambers Meets Leaders.
Judge Chambers of the federal
board of mediation and conciliation
held a brief conference with the broth
erhood heads this morning. Further
than to say he had one question on
which he wanted a definite answer
and that he got it, the conferees would
not dlscusB tho nature of hiB visit
Mr. Chambers went to tho Whito
House immediately upon leaving the
brotherhood officials,
"I should not like to say that the
situation still Is hopeful," A. B. Gar
retson, spokesman for the employes,
said after Mr. Chambers had left.
"Hopeful is hardly the word that I
should use. I would say. though, that
I deem a settlement still possible."
Wilson Calls President.
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today Invited the presidents
of the principal railroads of the coun- IH
try to" come to Washington immedi
ately to confer with him on tho
threatened railroad strike. Pending
their arrival he does not plan, to see
the committee members here with
whom he has been meeting.
The president sent the following
telegram to the leading railroad presl
volved in the threatened railroad
strike has reached a point which
makes it highly desirable that I
should personally confer with you
at the earliest possible moment,
and with the presidents of any
other railways affected, who may
be immediately accessible. Hope
you can make it convenient
1o come to Washington at once."

mittee had refused finally to concede

plan proposed, and the question now
Is to be taken up with the heads of
the railroads themselves.
The situation as it stood this morn
Ing was this: The railroads flatly
refuse to concede the eight-hour day,
but are willing to arbitrate that ques
