Washington, D. C.. Aufl. 1®"—
President Wilson late today com
pleted a definite plan for settle
ment of the threatened railroad
strike which he will submit to
morrow to the oeneral committee
of the 640 representatives of the
employes and to the general man
igtrt' committee.
The plan Involves the accept
ance of a basic eight hour day»
with regular pay for overtime and
an investigation by a commission
of other issues.
The president regards the plan
he has prepared, after confer
ences with both sides, as a fair
one which can be accepted. He
has fortified himself with figures
regarding the cost of an eijht
hour day to the railroads In order
to enter fully into a discussion
with both sides.
Should either side reject the
proposal It is understood the
president will turn to public opln
Ion to force a settlement.
It was stated that In ease the
president's efforts fall action off
som^ Kind may be taken In con
gress to prevent a tleup of the
railroad systems of the country.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 16. —Presi
dent Wilson decided today to postpone
further conferences with the repre
sentatives of the' railroads and em
ployes on the threatened railroad
strike until tomorrow, when he will
Jreceive the general committee of 640
Workmen in the east room of the
White house.
In .the meantime the committee of
managers here and the general com
mittee of employes will meet to dis
cuss tentative plans now before them.
The president, through Judge Wil
liam L. Chambers of the federal board
of mediation and conciliation, will
keep in close touch with the represen
tatives of both sides. No engagement
has been made for the managers' com
mittee but it is probable that the pres
ident will see them tomorrow.
The plan on which the president is
working is to put into effect the eight
hour day and have a federal commis
sion investigate collateral issues. It
was said to be possible today that if
the railroads conceded an eight hour
day the employes will be urged to give
up their demand for time and & half
overtime.
The proposed commission investiga
tion would not have power to enforce
any decision but would investigate all
questions involved in the controversy
and make recommendations. The halt
In negotiations has been caused pri-
2ood
iarUy by the fact that the brother
leaders who have
been,
meeting
with the president have no plenary
powers and have to refer all important
questions back to their general com
mittee in New York.
Calls Whole Committee.
President Wilson decided time
would be saved and better results
achieved 1* the 640 members of the
general committee were brought to
Washington and met him directly.
Therefore, it was decided to hold a
general meeting at the white house
Thurif ay.
The committee of managers remain
ed in session almost continuously to
day discussing the conferences with
the president and the tentative sugges
tions outlined. It was stated that the
negotiations are now in such form
that definite decisions may be made
by both sides befbre the end of the
wools*
Administration officials would not
predict the outcome of the negotia
tions today because everything de
pends on the decisions of the man
agers ajnd the employes. It was stated
that hope for a peaceful settlement
had not been abandoned.
MEN ACCEPT INVITATION.
NeW York, Aug. 16.—The invitation
of President Wilson to the 640 gener
al chairmen of the four brotherhoods
of railroad employes to meet him in
Washington to consider his proposals
for settlement of the threatened rail
road strike was accepted by the men
here today and announcement made
that they would leave earlylhi3 after

TO
AVERT STRIKES
IS LATEST IDEA
PLAN 13 SAID TO BE GETTING
SERIOUS ATTENTION AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 16.—Out of
the deadlock between the railroad
managers and the brotherhood leaders
a new proposal appeared today for a
special commission to consider not
only the present wage dispute, but all
others In the future.
While President Wilson, the man
agers' committee and the spokesmen
for the men awaited the arrival of the
employes' committee of 640, which Is
expected here from New York tomor
row for the next white house con
ference, administration officials and
the representatives of the two sides
considered the commission idea with
a degree of seriousness which indicat
ed it would some into the Negotiations
as one of the next steps in the presi
dent's attempt to avert a nation wide
strike.
Representatives of the railroad
managers, were favorable to the plan
in principle, and administration of
ficials investigating its, availability
conferred with A. B. Garretson, spokes
men for the men, while a member of
the federal Industrial relations made
a report favoring such an idea as an
enlargement of the present federal
board of mediation and conciliation.
It was realized on all hands, however,
that the proposal was merely in the
status of a suggestion which must
pass the test at further conferences
with the president.
Meanwhile the situation remained
unchanged with both sides hoping for
a way out of the difficulty.

EXTENT OF SERVICE THE
MIKADO 18 GIVING.
Paris, Aug. 5.—(Correspondence of
T'ie Associated Press)—The extent to
which Japan is clothing, shoeing,'arm
ing and munitioning the Russian army
was fSrclbly presented to a military
observer who has just returned from
a trip along the Russian front.
"I was astonished," he said, "to
find great numbers of Russian soldiers
clothed from head to foot in uniforms
made in Japan.
"It is strange that Russia went to
war with Japan over Korea and now
Korea is supplying Russia with shoes
in which her soldiers are marching to
victory."
"How did these supplies get from
Japan to the Russian front?" the ob
server wa»* asked.
"It was noted," said he, "that about
the only vital point where the Ger
mans had not been able to send their
submarines was in the waters of the
East China" sea, the Straits of Korea
and the Sea o\ Japan. These are the
waters separating Japan from Russia
aqd the Asiatic mainland and the
routs over them, commercial and mili
tary, are open and without menace."
"Russia is getting all sorts of arms
and ammunition from Japan," he con
tinued, "from the service rifle and
small field pieces up to the big twelve
lndh guns.''
The observer said the report that
French and Japanese officers are now
furnishing expert direction of the Rus
sian artillery fire is not correct.
"The Russian artillery officers are
directing their own fire, and are get
ting splendid results," said.

PRACTICALLY LAW
Washington, D. C., Aug. 16. —Navy
officers virtually had before them to
day the task of carrying out the lar
gest program for building warships
ever adopted with a single appropria
tion by any nation.
Although technically not completed,
the naval bill, carrying $315,800,000,
had been approved in its main provi
sions by congress and was in the hands
of a conference committee only to set
tle minor differences between the
house and senate on navy yard ap
propriations.
Anticipating speedy disposition of
remaining questions, the navy depart
ment already had begun plans for put
ting into effect provisions of the big
building policy and increased person
nel features approved yesterday by the
house. The senate's building program
was ratified by a vote of 283 to 51 and
the personnel increase by a viva voca
vote. Senate Increases in appropria
tions for navy yards' were disagreed
to and the bill sent back to conference
for determination of these points,

Great Effort Being Made to

Defending Lemberg
Berlin, Aug. 16.—German troops
havr won a success In the Car
pathian region, according to the
wi.t office announcement today,
capturing 8tarawipozyna height
north of Capul.
To the north of the Dniester In
Galicia the Russians only attacked
weakly and were repulsed.
Paris, Aug. 16.—It is reported
that Germany is taking over the
defense of Triest, sending troops
especially organized for that pur
pose, says a dispatch to the
Temps from Milan today.
London, Aug. 16.—The Russians, af
ter a considerable period of inactivity
In the Carpathians, are moving aggres
sively against the Teutonic forces
there. Following the taking of Jab
lonitza, one of the chief gateways to
Hungary, reported last night, they
have captured a series of heights west
of Vorokhta and Ardezemoy. Petro
grad reports an Austrian retirement
to the west in this region.
The movement is considered of im
portance as tending more effectively
to protect the left flank of the Rus
sian armies moving.northwestward In
the Stanislau-Hallce region in their
advance on Lemberg.
This is the first news Qt_ap advance
by the Russian southern army since
the conquest of the Austrian crown
land of Bukowina was completed.
Further north the Russians are ad
vancing against the Austrians, appar
ently with uninterrupted success.
Fierce fighting is in progress along
the entire line south of Brody and
Gen. Brussiloff Is making a supreme
effort to cut off the army of Gen. von
Bothmer and force its surrender.
At Verdun there was a violent ar
tillery bombardment east of the
Meuse but no infantry activity. Raids
by both Austrian and Italian airmen
are occurring with frequency in the
region around Triest and Gorizzla.
There is renewed discussions of ef
forts to Induce Rumania to play a
more active part in the war. Germany,
anxious to insure Rumania's continued
neutrality, is reported by a Rucharest
newspaper to have offered her terri
torial compensation to this end, at the
expense of Austria.
NEW8 FROM THE FRONT.
German trenches opposite the Brit
ish position at Gomecourt on the
Somme front, Monday, Aug. 14.—Via
Berlin, Aug. 16.—(From a staff corres
pondent of the Assocjated PreBs)—
Half a million British have been en
gaged in the effort to break the Ger
man lines on the Somme front. Often,
as In the fighting between Gomme
court and Hebuterne, the British out
numbered the Germans six to one.
They have gained around to a depth
of from three to five miles over a front
of about eighteen miles but nowhere
have been able to break through.
More than' ever, death has become
a commonplace In this most murder
ous battle of all times. The Germans
in the first line know that they prob
ably will be killed if their positions
are attacked. Trenches are virtually
useless for the heavy British shells
widen them into broad channels, af
fording no cover of any sort. The
first line usually perishes.
The advancing British foot troops
are no better off because the Germans
reverse the process when part of their
positions have been captured. After
the British artillery haB leveled the
German trenches the Infantry rushes,
often to be thrown out again as soo
as the British artillery ceases fire,
which it has to do owing to the prox
imity of the opposing lines. Thus the
battle has been going on for weeks,
the opposingp forces now gaining at
terrific, cost and then losing at even
greater cost a few yards of trenches.
At present all thfe fighting by the Brit
ish is,:,carried on from their Pozieres
salient, where their drum fire is un
ceasing day or night. German officers
who were in the Champagne offensive
said no such artillery fire ever had
been developed previously.
MANY TEUTONS CAPTURED.
Petrograd, Aug. 16.—Between June
4, when the Russians offensive was
Inaugurated, and August 12, Gen.
Brusslloff's forces captured more than
358,000 men, the war office announced
today.
The Russians have captured a series
of heights to the west of Vorokhta
and Ardzemoy, in the Carpathians. In
the Vorokhhta .and Delatyn regions
the Austrians are retiring to the west

Nome, Alaska, Aug. 16. —Six mem
bers of the Vilhjahnur Stefansson Arc
tic expedition who arrived here yester
day on the power schooner Alaska to
day related their experiences in the
polar regions during the last three
years. They said Stefansson, who re
mained In the Arctic to continue his
work of exploring newly discovered
land north of Prince Patrick land,
probably would not return to civiliza
tion during the present season.
The party aboard the Alaska was
the southern party, under Dr. Rudolph
Anderson. Stefansson's chief subordin
ate, who had been exploring and chart
ing the coast line bordering Union and
Dolphin straits and the Coronation
gulf region, far east of the Mackenzie
river muoth.
All of the little party which left here
on the Alaska in July, 1913, returned
with the exception of Daniel Blue, en
gineer, who died of disease at Bailey
Island during May, 1915. The mem
bers of the crew which reached here
today were Dr. Anderson, J. J. O'Neill,
geologist John R. Cox, surveyor Dr.
D. Jenness, anthropodlst J. Johnson,
oceanographer and etomologist and
George Wilkins, photographer. The
schooner was under the command of
(Japt. Sweeney, who Joined the expedi
tion while it was in Arctic waters. The
entire party was In good physical con
dition. They said they thoroughly en
joyed their long experience In the Arc
tic, Respite the many hardships en
countered.
Most of the time since the spring of
1914 the party has been in quarters at
Bernard harbor on Coronation gulf
east of the Mackenzie river, one of the
least known sections of the habitable
earth.
The last member of the party to see
Stefansson was the photographer, Wil
kins, who was one of those who de
parted from the 111 fated Karluk short
ly before that vessel was carried away
in the grip of the northern ice in the
fall of 1913 and later crashed near
Hearld Islands. Wilkins was with
Stefansson last winter, having rejoin
ed him last year. Later Wilkins made
the trip over the ice to Coronation
gulf and joined the Anderson party.

LATE
AIDED BY RAINS
FEDERAL BUREAU GIVES OUT IN
FORMATION ABOUT THE CON
DITION OF CROP8.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 16.-s-"Dam
age -by blight and rust continued on
late sown spring wheat In the north
ern part of the spring wheat area and
extended into northeastern Montana,
although the extension of rust damage
was checked somewhat by the cool
er weather that prevailed," the weath
er bureau today announced in review
ing crop conditions for the week
which ended yesterday in the national
weather and crop bulletin. Corn gen
erally was benefitted by the weather
except in Kansas, Oklahoma and
north and west Texas, where little or
no rain fell.
"In Kansas the prospect for corn de
creased steadily and In many places
in that state the crop promises to be
a failure because of the lack of rain
fall," says the bulletin.
"It is feared that the rain came too
late for most of the corn in Missouri,
although the late planted will un
doubtedly be greatly benefitted. Early
corn was badly damaged in Iowa and
many stalks have failed to ear well
but the rain will greatly benefit late
corn in that state. The rainfall was
very beneficial in Illinois, Indiana and
Ohio and corn, together with other
crops, is responding well to the more
favorable conditions."
