Midland Gets Property for
City Station at Jamestown
Jamestown, Aug. 14. Announce
ment was made late this afternoon
that the Midland Continental Railway
company closed a deal with G. W.
Howe, one of the last men in line for
the Midland extension to the down
town business district of Jamestown,
for his property, comprising one house
and lot in block 30, original addition,
comprising a space of 40 by 140 feet.
The consideration was given at $4,500.
The deal, which is of wide importance
locally, was closed through the law
firm of Thorp & Chase.
This is the site of the Midland's new
passenger station and freight house
which will place its trackage facilities
in the heart of the downtown business
district. The freight house, it was an
nounced will be 200x50 feet and the
new station 100 feet in length. Work
on the structures will commence as
soon as possible.
With the sale of the Howe property,
the company with the exception of the
property owned by Mike Wenzell, has
purchased its right-of-way up to Third
avenue and will in all probability go
farther as permission was recently
asked at the session of the city council
by the company to cross over Third
avenue. Wenzell is the only man hold
ing out. Whether condemnation pro
ceedings would be started could not be
stated for certain.
The Howe property in block 30 is
located at the corner of Main street
&n0 Third avenue south.

MINNESOTA FARMERS JOINING
Harry Schumacher passed through
Valley City the first of the week on
his way to Wadena, Minn., to take
charge of a crew for the purpose of
organizing the Nonpartisan league in
that state. He states that he finds the
farmers very anxious to organize, and
while the price has been raised to $16,.
it is even easier to get them to join
than when they could get in at $9.
The entire state of Minnesota will be
a strong Nonpartisan state within a
short time. This state is practically
organized, just a few who were a little
afraid at first being left, but they will
be reached some time this fall, and
will no doubt fall in line with the rest
of the farmers. Harry is rated as one
of the league's best field men and is
doing well.
Their Tenth Annual Picnic
Celebrated at Jaberg Farm
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Jaberg, at their
home one-half mile north of Sanborn,
gave their tenth annual picnic Sunday.
The affair was held in the fine, large
grove on the Jaberg farm.
Ten years ago a picnic was given
by the Jabergs to the old settlers of
the west end of the county, and every
summer since that year one has been
held. Now they are an annual affair
and looked forward to with pleasure
by those who attend.
The picnic Sunday was an exception
ally pleasant event, and the attendance
was over 100. About 90 people par
took of the dinner at the first table and
about 25 were served afterwards. And
talk about dinners! Ing Moe and
other old timers who have never miss
ed one of these annual feeds say this
was the best ever, and both in quan
tity and quality left nothing to be de
sired.
-There was no set program, only a
social good time for the friends and
neighbors of this worthy family. The
spirit of goodfellowship so prevalent
with the pioneers of that section was
manifest throughout the gathering,
and everybody present was made to
feel that their presence was appre
ciated.
It was a great day for visitors and
hosts, and will be retained in their
memories as one of the sunny days of
their lives.

Short Crop Means an
Increase in Dairying
Dairy Commissioner Greenwood was
a visitor over Sunday at his home in
this city, coming in from Bismarck Sat
urday evening. Mr. Greenwood was a
visitor last week around Minot and re
ports that the crop is just about the
same in all parts of the state.
He reports that dairying is get
ting more attention that ever
before in the history of the
state, "'which will mean that the
present short crop will in reality be
worth millions of dollars to the farm
ers in the future. Wherever the dairy
cow has been given a fair trial she
has been the biggest money-maker on
the farm, and will undoubtedly prove
so in North Dakota.
HOGS BRING BIG MONEY

HiiiiiiiDiiiimii
Calumet Co. Thinks
Ladd Hurt Business
Fargo, Aug. 13.—The Calumet Bak
ing Powder company, of Chicago, has
filed suit in federal court against Dr.
E. F. Ladd, state food commissioner
of North Dakota, asking $100,000 dam
ages in connection with an effort
which Dr. Ladd made to prevent the
sale of the company's product in this
state.
About Jan. 1, Dr. Ladd brought ac
tion in district court before Judge Pol
lock asking the court to determine
whether under the North Dakota pure
food laws the baking powder manu
factured by the Calumet company
could be sold in this state.
Dr. Ladd contended that the pow
der contained albumen which, while
not actually injurious, made the pow
der appear to be of better quality than
it really was.
Before the case came to trial attor
neys asked that it be transferred to
the federal courts. It was then taken
before Judge Charles C. Amidon, of
the Utoited States district court.
Judge Amidon decided that the com
pany should not be permitted to use
the water glass test of the powder in
making demonstrations because the
presence of albumen made it appear
that the powder was more effective
and better than it actually was.
He also ruled, However, that the
company could not be prevented from
selling its product in North Dakota
and enjoined Dr. Ladd from taking
any action to prevent the sale of the
baking powder in North Dakota.

junior high school will open in Sep
tember for the first time. An enroll
ment of over 200 students is expected,
according to announcement made by
Superintendent N. C. Koontz today.
Miss Emma Thompson, who has been
principal of the Franklin school for

These contests are one of the best
means of keeping the buttermakers
posted as to the quality of the butter
they are turning out for the market.
The better the quality of cream the
better, of course, the butter that can
be made.
Dairying in North Dakota is rapidly
advancing. Milking machines are get

last fall'was allowed to dry up, owing
to the big crop, this fall is being better
cared for to keep up the flow of milk.

Thomson Building Modern
Coal Handling Facilities
J. H. S. Thomson, of the Farmers'
Elevator Co., has a big improvement
under way that will greatly facilitate
the economical handling of coal the
coming fall and winter. Work has be
gun on two reinforced concrete pockets,
each of 500 tons capacity, to be situat
ed on the north side of the Northern
Pacific tracks just east of the engine
stalls. The size of the foundation, now
going in, gives indication of the weight
and stability of the structure. The
work is being done by Leilich Bros.
Concrete Co., of Dundee, 111.
Coal will be unloaded by dumping
from hopper cars into a pit under the
track. It will be carried by an elec
tric conveyor to either pocket, where
an electric elevator will dump it into
any bin desired.
In unloading coal will be dumped
into the wagons in any desired amount
up to several tons, without any shovel
ing or hand work.
Around World for a Wife
Dies After Four Months
Mandan, Aug. 14.—To work for a
year and a half to get home with a new
wife for whom he had traveled all
around the earth, and then to live with
h^r in the North Dakota home for but
four months, was the trick fate played
on Peter Eckroth, farmer of the St.
Anthony vicinity. He died at 6 o'clock
Saturday night of cancer of the stom
ach. The body was taken to Kennel
ly's parlors and later taken to St.
Anthony, where the funeral services
were held Sunday morning. Deceased
was about 45 years of age, and is sur
vived by his wife and ten children.
Eckroth was the pawn with whom
the diplomats of two nations worked
for nearly a year and a half. He left
for his old home in Russia just before
the war broke out and with the open
ing of hostilities was held for military
service. State's Attorney Langer and
Congressman Norton took the matter
up with the state department and Sec
retary Bryan started action which fin
ally persuaded Russian authorities
that Eckroth was a naturalized United
States citizen. He was permitted to
return, and in order to get back home
was forced to travel eastward around
the earth to Vladivostock, Japan, San
Francisco and thence home. But his
mission had been successful and he
brought home with him the wife he
had gone to get.
Deceased owned a large amount of
land and was very well-to-do.

North Dakota Troops
Are Splendidly Fixed
It has rained every day since we ar
rived, but the second night we were is
sued cots and mosquito bar coverings.
The small field hospital has been fill
ed a few times, but only with men with
stomach trouble caused by the water.
We have had no cases of disease. We
all have had to work hard getting our
camp in shape, but we get plenty to
eat and a good dry place to sleep.
I If the army rules force the guard to
lay its sick in the mud, as the writer
of this clipping states, them the offic
ers in command of the North Dakota
regiment may be charged with violat
ing the army rules, for we have a good
comfortable place for each man in the
I hospital.
There is another camp three miles
from ours where over 15,000 men are
stationed. Most of the men in that
camp are without cots, but do not
I seem to be suffering any from the
rain. The officers there have ordered
flooring for all the tents.
This certainly is an interesting coun
try. It is very thickly covered with
mesquite trees, brush and cactus.
There are lots of flies and gnats, but
no mosquitoes. We have killed sever
al tarantulas and scorpions since we
have been in camp. The farming dis
trict is a network of irrigation ditches.
The land sells for from $200 to $500 an
acre.
We have had very little drill so far.
We have been on a couple of hikes.
Our camp is now in good shape, so I
suppose we will follow our daily sched
ule, which is as follows:
5:30 a. m.—Reveille.
6:00 a. m.—Mess.
6:35 a. m.—Drill.

Fine Showing forFmgal Banks
Two weeks ago the Times-Record
clipped from the Litchville Bulletin a
compilation of the bank deposits of
the county, in which Fingal was cred
ited with $142,216 in deposits. The
Herald calls attention to the fact that
their deposits are really $245,392.58,
and the Litchville paper acknowledges
that a typographical error was made.
We gladly do our share in putting the
banks of Fingal in their proper place
in the column by calling attention to
the error.
Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Aamoth and son

Detroit, Minn., where Mrs. Aamoth

A letter from Bert Weston to the
Times-Record encloses a clipping from
the Minneapolis Journal telling how
army rules force the national guard to
lay sick men on the wet ground. He
says that if such conditions prevail in
other camps, they certainly do not in
the North Dakota camp, which is in
first-class shape. The letter follows:
Mercedes, Texas, Aug. 7, 1916.
Editor of Times-Record:
Dear Sir:—Enclosed you will find a
clipping from one of the northern pa
pers describing the conditions at one
of the Texas camps. For fear that the
people of Valley City will think that
we are suffering similar hardships, will
say that we have not suffered any yet
from the weather conditions. It will
probably be interesting to know that
the North Dakota regiment is the sec
ond is the best equipped regiment in
the United States, being surpassed
only by one Illinois regiment.
