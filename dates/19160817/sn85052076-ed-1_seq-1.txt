School
" Yes, the children are out of school this week,
allow we will pet them in next week or the week after.
This is what a father says, and a father who thinks
he loves his children. His excuse is that he is a "pore "
. man. He and his children will always be poor if they
do not have enough "spunk" to get an education, when
it is offered to them in the free school.
The people tfho do send their children to school
have a duty to their neighbors who neglect the matter.
Those parents whose children are out of school ought to
be kindly talked with by their neighbors and urged to
send their children to school, and to send them immedi
ately, and to send them every day.
Hurrah for the New Pike!
There is a " boom " on for pike building. The fash
ion sets that way. The United States government is giv
ing money, and the people along the roads are subscrib
ing money and labor and paying taxes. It looks as
though our horses would have an easier time and draw
heavier loads, and automobiles would flash through the
country at a great rate.
There is one question, will good roads pay. The
saving in horse flesh and wear of vehicles will pay for
any pike in a few years, and we shall all be better neigh
bors for having good roads.
There is, however, one danger. This money is likely
to be spent without giving us the good roads. In the
first place a great many people want to get the money
without doing any work. And in the second place there
are very few people who know how to make a good
pike. If this money is spent and the roads are not
greatly improved and made permanent, the people will
be discouraged and the cause of good roads set back
for thirty years.
Kvery good citizen should 1 on the watch and see
that the money spent on roads is spent in the right way.

TU RAILROADS
Wilson Confers With Men and
Managers.
BASIS FOR MEDIATION NEAR
Outlook Over tha Situation Brightens
Following Conferanoes at tha White
Houa Further Conferences May
Find Solution of Differences.
Washington, Aug. 15. President
Wilson put squarely ap to tho rail
roads the questing of prerentlng
nation-wlda strike.
The president held separata confer
ences with the representatires of the
brotberhoode and the representatives
of the railroads. It Is understood that
tha labor leaders agreed to arbitrate
their main contentions, namely, the
eight-hour day and time and a half
pay for overtime. It la understood
they refused to consider arbitration
of tha railway's counter demanda.
The railway managera seam glum
and despondent. They have been
closeted for hours In secret session,
threshing out the situation.
The union men appear entirely sat
isfied. They aeem more confident
than jubilant
Following bis conference with the
railway managers tne president au
thorized this statement:
"I have met both sides and have
gone over the case with the utmost
frankness. I will not be able tojudg-i
until later whether we hare found a
feasible basis of - settlement."
The president, according to those
who attended the conference, showed
a familiarity with the situation that
surprised the men. "The president
was most sympathetic," said one of
the brotherhood leaders, "and his sur
prising knowledge of the situation.
and of our position, may result In an
understanding being reached."
The president, it was said, submit
ted no counter proposition to the mn,
but he held out hope for an adjust
ment by legislation. If necessary.
The Impression prevailed amon?
the brotherhood leaders that as a last
resort the president might ask the
congress for eight-hour day legisla
tion. The president will meet both of the
opposing groups today. The commit
tee from the managers will visit the
white house first. When their confer
ence Is concluded the union heads will
meet the chief executive.
The fact that the railway managers
will have their conference first is
taken to mean that they will Inform
the president whether they have ac
ceded to or refused his requests.
One railroad manager said: "Evi
dently if the strike ia averted all the
concessions will hare to be made by
tha railroads."
This Is the railway point of view,
On the other hand, the employes ap
pear to have made concessions by
agreeing to arbitrate certain parte r!
the matters In dispute. They hoi
said they were unalterably opposed to
such action.
The economic disaster incident to
such a strike were strongly stressed
by the president In his conference
with the railway managers. He drove
homo this point, making it the more
timely by emphasising the country's
present prosperity, and Its millions
of dollars of watting freight.
Both employers and employee were
most reticent over what occurred at
tha white house. Each said the mat
ter was "in the hands of the president
and until ha had disposed of It there
would bo no comment." '
Judge William L. Chambers of the
mediation board, waa prominent . io
tha negotiations. He visited the presi
dent before either of the disputants
Mr. Wilson. Tho mediator was
oalUd In by the president following
each of the two conferences. He sat
with the railway managers in tholr
meeting. Late In tha day he, Justice
Brandela and Attorney General Gig-
ory were in consultation wtto tne
president.

Evefs on the western frontier
of the war have been at a standstill
during the week on account of the
had weather. The English and
French have held the positions gain
ed and minor attacks and .
attacks have been made.
The Russians have made notable
advance against the Austrians and
Germans during the week. Tho
rapture of Stanislan brings Lem-
berg, the capital of Galicia, within
a distance of eighty miles. It also
gives the Russians advantage of a
railroad center, from which roadi
radiate in all directions.
The most signillcient event of the
week, in this European War, has
been the capture of Gorizia by the
Italians. The occupation of this
place opens the way to Trieste.
Austria's seaport at the head of
the Adriatic and a place long covet
ed by the Italians.
There has been much discussion
throughout Germany, during the
week, of possible peace terms. A
greater decree of freedom than is
usual is given to the discussion. The
treatmen of Alsace-Loraine seems
to give rise to more difficulty than
either Belgium or Poland.
Plans are being made for laying
cable direct from Russia to tha
United States, at the present time
business relations must be carried
on Ihroiurh Great Britain, which
'
auses much inconvenience in theso
disturbed times.
President Wilson has sent, during
the week, a personal letter to the
mperor of Germany, the content of
which is not fully known but is
thought to be a request to allow the
people of the United States to carry
on relief work in Poland.
Reports from Mexico City indicate
a shortage of food which has led to
serious riots. The light and power
plants of the city are said to be in
the hands of the rioters. People
collect along the railroad and beg
bread and fruit from passengers.
It is well to notice that Japan is
taking advantage of present con-
itions to extend her trade. Her
exports have increased many mil-
ions of dollars during the year and
