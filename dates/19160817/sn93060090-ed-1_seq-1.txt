Beautiful aoeneries, which the

their feet upon their frontier
Their curiouBity is aroused,.. The
beautiful bubbling springs as
they burst forth from the foot of
the mountains, from -under - the
rugged cliffs; And ripple off
down the beautiful vallies, from
which the thirst of the traveler
Is slacked, - which brighten the
eye of the close observation of
the grand foliage spread upon
the mountain side. Onward and
upward tbey go, until the very
summit is reached, and it broad

the eye calches the beautiful
golden grain fields.
And the great herds of cattle
