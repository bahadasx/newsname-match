LETS PROPERLY
NUMBER HOMES
IN LOGAN CITY
It occurs to us that there Is an or
dinance In the Btatute books of Logan
I City requiring tho residents of tho
city to properly number their homes.
If this Is the case, would It not be a
good plan to see that the ordinance
Is lived up to?
It may be charged that The Logan
Republican Is urging this matter be
cnuso It needs tho houses numbered
In order to give tho proper delivery
service, and we admit that this is
the case.
There are other papers delivered In
Logan City. Delivery boys hnvo to
make delivery for the merchants.
The post office department has to
make delivery of malls. And when a
new man conies on the Job In any
one of these capacities, thoy havo,
hard time to get their bearings.
Would it not be a good thing for Lo
nn City officers Jn charge of such
matters to take up the question with
tho residence owners and havo them
attend to this work?
Tho Logan Republican has a solic
itor In tho field and he says thero Is
not one houso In every live that is
properly numbered, with the number
displayed where It can be easily ob
nerved by persons who are trying to
locate any particular number. In
tome towns the post office department
vdll not deliver malls where homes
oro not numbered. Wo cannot see
why this matter should not be at
tended to.

DRAINAGE
LANDS GIVEN
NEW TITLE
Richland Acres, a name suggested
by Milton Merrill, 3CS East Center
street, Logan, Utah has been chosen
by the board of directors of the Lo
gan and Drainage Company as .io
official title of Its land that Is being
drained lust west of this city A
check for $23 -will be handed to the
Voung man us soon ns he returns to
tho city. He la a boii of Lorln A.
Morrill and Is 15 jenrs of age.
Richland Acres Is being drained
rapidly now. Tho results, according
to Manager A. F. C'urdon. are most
gratifying and show conclusive')- that
success is sure to come in time ns
rains and snows aid In washing tho
land. Three more machines for dig
ging trenihes will arrive within a
short time, two from Iowa and one
from Box Elder County. Nearly a
mite of tile a day should be latd by
all of the machines when they get
started properly.
"One of the finest sights for any
one loving the soil Is to see the type
of soil bolng drained at the west end
of our project," said Manager Cord
on. "The land Is between Little BAar
and 'Logan rivers, and Is a marsh
when the river Is up; but when the
river goes Jown the rushes and tules
wo cut for ha . We are building a
largo open drain through the center
of this area and the cuts show a very
deeb black loam made up of decayed
vegetation that has been accumulat
ing there for ages. No finer soil can
bo found anywhere and Is worth a
trip to see. The results of our drain
ago are Just being realized here, but
another month will have the entire
piece dry ns It should be. Wo believe
Uiat' the wholo piece can be sublrrl
gated, in which ovent our open drain
ican'1ie'usedto flood It without much
trouble. Our plan 1b to experiment
with it with that end in view. Sub
bing land has been so successful else
j where that we are anxious to see what
can bo done here."
Actual selling will bo begun for
Richland Acres within a short time.

WB JH
Officer In Army flfl
London, Aug. 15 Tho Germans nt Effl

of Inhumanity nnd brutality which flfl

an Associated Piess corroipondent 'ill
protested strongly ngalnBt what thoy flfl
termed the campaign of defamation '81
which was being waged against thefn. '
A high German officer, who has lee f Kjfl
tured on tho various actions of the ujjM
present offensive, said: Cvfl
"We officers and men at tho front Klfl
aro well Informed on what our oppo
nentg and neutrals sav of us, Wn ilfl
know that we are called Huns - and - fl

world havo been scattered through- jfl
out the city for tho past four years. fl
This condition, he wishes to remedy, jfl
and therefore Is tolerating a negro- ifl
