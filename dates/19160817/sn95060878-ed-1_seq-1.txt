NEER R0GKW00D ADMITS
CRIMINAL INTENT AT Hill
(By B. F. Fly)
Chief Engineer C. R.
Rockwood, of ,the Imperial
irrigation district, in trying
to bolster up his administra
tion, has made the astound
ing statement over his own
signature that it was always
his intention to construct a
rock and pile dam at Hanlon
heading, notwithstanding
the fact that the Government
had originally forbidden any
thing other than a dam of
sand and brush, and he open
ly accuses Editor Howe, of
the Imperial Press, of "giv
ing, the snap away."
In fact, he brazenly asserts
that Editor Howe was the
first to apprise Yuma valley
farmers' of his intention to
break the law in defiance of;
the War Department permit.'
! For' the sake of keeping
the record straight it can be
asserted most positively that
Project Manager Layson had
his eye on Rockwood all the
time, and knew within an
hour of the arrival of the first
car load of piling at Hanlon
heading, which was long be
fore the Calexico Chronicle;
(not the Imperial Press)
"gave the snap away."
In fact, Mr. Lawson advised the
officials in both Denver and Wash
ington of the outrage Rockwood -was
preparing to perpetrate, and the facts
were so stated in these columns long
before they were admitted by the
Calexico Chronicle.
As a matter of fact, all the time
that Rockwood was using his "bird
cage man" to try to dam up the Colo i
rado with four strands of wire, Rock-
w'oocl himself was' assembling" his pil
Project Manager Lawson, always
on the job in the interest of Yuma
valley farmers, has today, as a direct
result of his efforts, received instruc
tions from the Interior Department
to put into effect the following rates
on cotton, in car lots, over the Gov
ernment line (3,000 pounds to the
car:
Boundary line to Yuma, 8c cwt.
Gadsden to Yuma 7c cwt.
Somerton Sd'g to Yuma, 5c cwt
Willets to Yuma 4c cwt.
Ludy to Yuma 3c cwt.
This favorable rate means a. great
saving to valley fanners who have
cotton to ship to the Yuma gin.
Formerly, Yuma valley growers
paid the Southern pacific 16c per
hundredweight to the Imperial val
ley gin.
