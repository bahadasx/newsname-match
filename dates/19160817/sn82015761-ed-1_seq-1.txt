KOLBSEXPEDITION
Three Days , of Frightful
Adventure And The Gun
nison Whirlpool Blocked
The Way ,
News readers were interested in i
Bertha Metzger's story July 27, of
the proposed expedition of ; 531s-.
worth Kolb and his three compan
ions down the Black Canyon of the.
Gunnison - for the purpose of
gathering engineering data for the
Denver and Rio Grande railroad
and to add more picture?, to the
collection of the Kolb Brothers.
The sequel to that story may now
be told since the expedition has
been completely wrecked in the
attempt to make the passage thru
the canyon.
On Wednesday July 26 the four
men of the party launched their
two boats and a life raft just above
the mouth of the Cimarron river.
The mad waters of the Gunnison
soon tore to pieces one boat and
the raft. The plans of the party
were rearranged and another start
was made on Friday The single
boat was let down the river with
tow lines. The men frequently
dragged into the turbulent waers,
but by helping each other and
swimming a good deal, six miles
were made. Sore and still weary
the trip was resumed the following
day, but the utmost . endeavors "of
the party could only accomplish
one mile of the perilous passage.
. Again the journey was taken up
and the men fought the raging
torrent, sometimes in -the water
and sometimes ""clinging " to the
walls of the canyon. The day's
fearful exertions netted the party
five miles but they were the last.
They were now down to the furious
whirlpool of the Gunnison whic'u
none may pass and live. Again
and again on the following day
they essayed to make progress,
only to be thrown back with great
violence by the swirling waters,
Night found them at the morning's
starling point, sore, beaten and dis
couraged.
The situation was thoroughly
studied in the morning, lo go
forward was impossible and to go
back was equally impossible
lhere was only one way to escape
and that was to climb 3,500 feet of
nearly " perpendicular precipice.
This they did and they are alive to
tell their wonderful tale of adven
ture and make plans for another
attempt to go down Black Canyon
when the water is at low stage.

WANTED A DEMO-
Two republicans of Coconino
County have announced their can
didacy for the republican nomin
ation for the office of representative
in the legislature. Are Coconino's
democrats going to let this office go
by default? . Surely Williams can
find a democrate who ' would fill
this office satisfactorily and who
would . accept the nomination,
were his friends to urge him to do
so. No - time should be - lost- in
moving in the . matter. The time
limit will soon expire.
P. S. RONAN FOR
JUSTICEJJF PEACE
P. S. Ronan who has announced
his candidacy for the nomination
for Justice of the Peace of Williams
Precinct on the republican ticket
is known to every one in Williams
and to a great many people outside
of Williams. He has lived in Wil
liams eight years and has been in
business here for nearly the whole
time. His only promise " to Wil
liams voters is that, if elected to
the office of Justice of the Peace,
he will strive to perform the duties
of the office with credit to hi nisei f
and to the satisfaction, of law-abid
ing people.
S. S ACKER FOR
COUNTY TREASURER
In this issue .' appears the an
nouncement of S. S. Acker for
the office of County Treasurer.
Mr. Acker' promised the people
that he would try and be the
right man in the right place, and
he thinks he has made good.
According to the present law
no Treasurer can hold this office
but two terms, and he asks that
you support him at the coming
election with the same liberal
vote you gave him two years ago,
His motto is the same now as
then, "What is just and right
for one man is just and right
for all." In the year 1915 he
collected $18,356.13 back taxes
that were delinquent Irom one
to five years, and not with stand
ing the twice a year payment of
taxes which makes twice as
much work in the office, the ex
pense of running the office has
been less than in previous years.
Mr. Acker is an old timer
comins: to this county in
1877, he worked hard and
scent a good deal of his
own money to defeat the bill
granting a subsidy to the Selig-
man and Frescott K. K. and on
which this county is now paying
interest on $159,000.99, their
proportion of that debt that was
assumed when this county was
formed.
At the election two years ago
Mr. Acker carried this precinct
by a very large majority and he
has given such general satisfac
tion that his name should be
even better received this year.
Booze Plenty, Drunks Common
The. interpretation which our
local court has placed on the feder
al court decision relating to the
shipment into a prohibition state
of liquor for personal use is likely
to fill Williams full of booze and
the streets with drunks, j The same
suitcases full of liquor over which
there was controversy in the court
were noticed to come into town on
No. 10 last Friday night and on
the same night men were stopped
on the street by drunken rowdies,

carefully disinfected. When the
work of preparation is all done the
building, outside and in, will look
spick and span.
The contractors promise that the
addition will be completed in time
for the beginning of school. The
hew rooms will be seated with
single seats of the most modern
design. They will have a shelf on

in writing! Several new bookcases
will be ready for use by the begin
ning of the school year. The book
cases were included in the contract
with Baumann & Hinds who are
building the addition.
. The drinking water at the school
house has never been entirely satis
factory and many pupils have car
ried water to school. The school
board has remedied this fault by
securing permission from Mr Bug-
gel n to take water from his well
near by. The water from the
Bug gel n well is of excellent quality
and easily- the" best In the 'city.
The water will be'. piped to the
schoolhouee and the drinking

trip. They are making expenses
by selling photographs of them
selves in different settings. The

capable of taking care of them

with virtue unassailed.

Mr. J. D. Dunn who seeks re
election to the office of County
Assessor is a Flagstaff man of
several years residence. He was
elected to the office of County
Assessor two years agj and seeks
reelection this year on his official
record. Mr. Dunn is too well known
in Coconino couniy to need an ex
tensive write-up. Every-body
knows him. He invites an exam
ination of his record and feels con
fident that it will bear thoro in
spection It looks reasonable that

to grant him the customary second
