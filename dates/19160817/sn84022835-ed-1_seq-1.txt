cess oC our Dress Goods Department has been due to the
fact that we have always carried a conservative stock of
the very newest and neatest patterns of seasonable mer-.

our Dress Goods at the end of each season, so that we can
start the next season with a nice, fresh stock of goods
for that reason we are offering some Wonderful Bargains
in Summer Dress Goods.
