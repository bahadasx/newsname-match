The directors of the Fair have done
everything in their power to make this

all classes of stock. They have also
the finest list of entries for the races
that was ever given in this entire west
ern country. Having as many as ,T6 j
horses entered for one race; also there
will be numerous other attraction in
the amusement line. They have secured
the celebrated Gate City Band of Poca
tello to furnish the music at the Fair

not lie a success unless you, (the farm- ;

the exhibits to show the people what
is produced in this county.
We' are having daily from ten to

section of the United States going thru
Blackfoot to the Yellowstone Park and
other points. Some of these parties will
be here during the fair and we want

A MATRIMONIAL FAILURE
Hazel Straehen has applied for a div
orce from her husband on the grounds
of incompatibility of temper, brutali
ty and jealousy. She alleges that the
cruel hubby even went so far as to
pinch her flesh, which inhuman conduct
gave her great and physical anguish and
pain for which she asks as balm a di
vision of community property, alimony
and the custody of their only minor
child. The deposed husband is a popu
lar fireman on the Mnck'ty branch who
has the reputation of being a nice fel
low and liis many friends are surpris
ed at his wife's startling allegations.
J. M. Stevens of Pocatello is this ag
grieved woman's Moses and her tale of
woo will probably be told in the dis
tri. t court.
