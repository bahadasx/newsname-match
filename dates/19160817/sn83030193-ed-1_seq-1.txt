In the face cf the official claim made by the French War Office

fronts totaling thre miles, Uerlin officially announces to-day that the
Anglo-French troops who penetrated positions around Maurepas have
teen driven back .fur suffering heavy losses.

The French War Oftice reports that a great artillery battle is in
progress near Maurepas. It says there were no infantry attacks last
night, but Berlin asserts that five French attacks in that region were
beaten off last night. Berlin does admit that German first line trenches
near Belloy-en-Santerre, south of the Somme, were lost to the French.
The London Wsr Office declares that the British, in conjunction with
the advance at Maurepas, pushed forward west and southwest of Guille
month, three miles away. The British also claim the capture of trenches
west of High Wood, in the same section.

It was towed In by a Drltlsh cruiser

No one on the Alaunla know any

PRESIDENT IS DISTURBED
BY DFFIANCE OF MANAGERS
AS HE MEETS WORKERS
Men at Conference Willing to Agree
to Tentative Proposal Providing
for Trial of 8 - Hour Day Under
Federal Supervision.
(From a Staff Correspondent of The Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. When tho 040 members of tho general com.
mlttee of executive chairmen of tho railroad workers' brotherhoods and
their sub-commltteo ot thirty-four, headed by tho four president ot tho
brotherhoods, this afternoon went beforo President Wilson to exchange with
htm pledges of co-opcratlon to end tho railroad strike thero could bo no mis
understanding ot tho willingness of tho chairmen to follow tho lead ot their
head In agreeing to tho tentative peaco plan proposed by President Wilton.
The union chiefs met In a local theatro Just before going to the White
IIoubo and heard from President Garrctson of tho conductors hli version
of the earlier conference of tho labor men with tho President, which, Ib sub
stantially as explained to them yesterday on their way hero.
Tho attitude of tho railroads, their'
managers and presidents still caused i ipr nr D1DI I1MCUT
uneasiness nt thn White llouso. Tho'LIlT Ul I All LI AlTltll I
action of tho President in sending for nnm nnnrn rn nnr -in
tho railroad presidents for n confer
euro with him nt tho earliest posnlblo
moment has not bettered tho temper
of tho managers. Tho mnnagers are
going nround saying, "Nobody Is go
ing to get nnywhern by going over
their heads," and that If tho Prosl
dent could soo tho telegrams ex-
changed between them nnd tholr pres.
Idents In tho last threo days hn would
realize that by calling the presidents
hero ho nnd simply doubted tho num
ber of enrnest experts who will tell
him that nn arbitration commission
much decldo whether n rigid eight-
hour dny Is practicable for "good rail- t
roadljig" and will not force inn roads
Into bankruptcy.
MANAGERS BELIEVED TO BE
UNDULY AROUSED.
Tho answer of the While lloiisn Is
that the managers am unduly con
rented, thntjhn President is calling
the railroads' executive heads to
gether to nssuro them no wasteful
demoralisation application of tlio
eight-hour day Is intended, but that
ho does Insist ion thn acceptance of
tho plan for a definite porl'xl ns nn
experiment of which tho lio.ird of
mediation and conciliation (with Its
appropriations rguch Increased and
Its powers enlarged) shall bo the
Judge.
Should this compromise bo rejected
by tho rnllrond corporation, as Mr.
Wilson does not believe it will be, It
Is pretty well settled they will ask for
ten days or two weeks m which to
mnkn new statistical survejs tu make
sure thero are no profitable and me
chnnlcally effective ways of adapting
tho eight-hour day to raipiadmg.
It Is nlso settled that when all else
falls, Mr. Wilson, with full knowledge
of tho fact that thn men most sensl
tlvo to public opinion nie not the
operators of tho lines or the titular
heads of the corporations, but the big
flnanclers back of the systems, will
not hesltnto to send a message lo
certain very touchy miiimnalii-N liv-
lug near Central Pink, New Vork,
nnd tho shores of Like Mir'ilg.m In

euro to underwrito the attitude ol
their hired men.

HEDLEY REFUSES TO ACT

ON DEMANDS OF CARMEN
POTS REPLY UP TO BOARD
Place of Directors, Who Discharged
Men, to Pass on Reinstatement,
Says Traction Manager Labor
Leaders Give Transit Officials
Until To-Morrow to Avert Strike.
THIRD AVE. MEN THREATEN
TROUBLE OVER DISMISSALS
General Manager Hetllty of the New York Hallways Company, in
conference to-day with a committee from the Street Carmen's Union,
Including officers of the "alien organization," with which both President
Shouts and he vowed they would never do business -passed responsibilily
for the discharge of seventy-'three employees since the agreement was
signed last week along to the Hoard of Directors. As a result of his
action, New Yorkers will not know for another day at least whether they
are lo be inconvenienced by a new city-wide traction strike.
At the outset of the conference General Organizer Fitzgerald of the
union forces demanded the reinstatement of the men who had been dis
missed before he would consent to discuss the other questions involved.
Medley said he was without authority to put the men back to work, as
their discharge had been ordered by the Board of Directors.
"If you nro without authority," said Fitzgerald, "thoro Is no need of going
any further with this conference. Our business Is with your Hoard of
Directors. Wo will kIvp you until to-morrow to get them together bo that
wo can cotiler with I hem." ,
"I can makn no promises about getting them together on luch short
notice," was lledlcy'.i answer to thltt ultimatum. "However, I'll seo what
can bo done In tho matter."
Later In (he. afternoon W. L. 1'ep-f'
pennnn, nn assistant ot President
Shunts, announced that thn traction
oinclalN wero mahlnB every effort to
Kl In touch with thn directors. Uu
said many of them wern spending
their vncntions In different parts of
tho country, but It was hoped to
reach a sutllelent number to havu a
quorum hero by to-morrow.
The colifereneo which ended so un
satisfactorily consumed about nn
hour. Whllu thn union leaders would
not discuss tlio subject, It was plain
that they looked upon Medley's aKree
tni? to confer with them as a sltrn
Hint tho company was weakening In
It determination not to recognize, tho
union.
Iteporters wern excluded from the
conference, but all reports nKroetl that
tho meotlnu proceeded without fric
tion. At Its conclusion tleneral Or
KanUur I'lUKernld said:
"Wo havo requested -Mr. Medley to
arraiiKo n meeting ot tho Hoard of
Dllectors, and If hn dnexn'l succeed In
dnlnK so wo will Immediately take up
thn matter with Mayor .Mltcbnl and
Chairman Straus of tho Public Service
Commission. Tho whole thin H a
question of n violation of the agree
ment slh'nod last week. Wn shall in
sist that these discharged men bo put
bark to work before, any other ques
tion Is considered."
Mr. Medley when asked for tho com
pany's version of what took plaeo at
tho meetlnK said:
"I havo no stateim nt to make at
present. It was aieed that tho min
utes of what took place would be
given to tho press after tho represent
atives of tho company and tho men
had made necessary corrections,
Tliesn minutes will speak for them-
SelWN."
FINAL EFFORTS MADE FOR
PEACE, SAYS UNION LAWYER.
Attorney l-'rhliger for tho union said
that If tho city officials were not
Miccessful- In compellliiK tho company
to 1 1 v o up to Us agreement his organ
ization would (cot that It had douo
verytblng possible to bring about a.

m aim
rmiii
peaceful settlement of the controversy
and would feel free, to act as It saw
fit.
Ilesldes Manager Medley, the com
pany was represented In tho confer
ence by Assistant Manager Norrls
and James I. Uuaekenbos, ono of Its
attorneys.
Several times during tho confer-,
enco Manager Medley endeavored to
liavw Hie union representative! lay
nslde, temporarily, tho demand for
the reinstatement of tho dismissed
employees, so that the other grlev
ances might ho considered, Tho
union leaders steadfastly rofusod to
alter their plans not to proceed with
the other questions until the soventy
threo men woro put back on their
cars.
Oeneral Organizer Fltigeraid
pointed out that under the agree
ment of last week every man who
went on strlko was to bo taken back
without prejudice. Mo characterized
thi' action of the company in dis
charging them as a gross violation of
th.it compact.
The union commltten was mndo up
as follows: William II. Fitzgerald,
general organizer of tho union and
tho man who has engineered tha
unionizing of tho employees on all
tho transportation linen of the city;
Louis J. I'rldlger, counsel for the
