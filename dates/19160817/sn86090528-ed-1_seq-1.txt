convenient to come to Washington."
Managers Obstinate
The action of the president resulted
from the attitude displayed by the
railroad managers in a statement left
at the While IIoise last night. In

that the strongest concession which
they would make would be to 'submit
the whole matter to arbitration, the
president to name the arbitrators.

The managers today showed no dis
position to recede from this position.
Several of their number declared they
saw politics in the president's efforts

Chief of Police
' 'Kill every dog you see running
loose on the streets that is not muz
zled" is the order tht: w-ent n;t; of th
office of the chief of police this morn
ing and a raid on the canine popula
tion of Chickasha may he expected
in the next few days.
On July 1. Mayor Coffman issued a
proclamation to thej citizens of the
town, warning them . that death to
canines would follow their being found
running loose on the streets for the
following sixty days, i. e. until Sep

ly bitten the other day the police force
have been given stricter orders. No
fear is entertained of rabies by the
city officers but these natural precau
tions must bo observed by citizens or
death to their pets will result.
Dr. E. Ij. Dawson, city physician, de
clares that no alarming symptoms
have developed in any of the four
cases of dog bite which have been
reported to him. The two Edgar chil
dren have already bctjii subjected to
the Pasteur serum treatment and
more of the serum has been wired for

THOUGHT DEPUTY WAS DEAD
Sorrow and gloom pervaded the of
fice of Sheriff Hodge Bailey last night.
Bob Castleman, the intrepid and
faithful deputy who has many good
catches to his credit, was dead. The
sheriff ''Tiiew he was dead although
he bad seen no evidences of a corpse.
The intelligence was the result of the
following deductions:
For nineteen months Bob had serv
ed faithfully without a day's layoff in
the service his country. Wednes
day morning, accompanied by Judge
Will I. Inn and Mr. Linn, senior, he
set out on a deferred fishing trip to
some point along the river, which, for
the sake of convenience, will be called
Lucile. "I'll be back Thursday if I
live." he declared to his chief before
departing.
"Hob has never lied to me" said the
sheriff mournfully last night, "and as
he did not come hack he must he dead

"Sammy'll get them" was the lacon-

of the appointment.
Dwyer has recently been engaged
in the garage business but up to a
month ago had been connected with
the Chickasha fire department for
nearly three years. His appointment
seems to meet with general approval
by those -who were, cognizant of it
