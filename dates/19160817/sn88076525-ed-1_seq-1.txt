Enthusiastic Meeting and Consider
able Sparring.
According to the call of President
Kelly of the Chautauqua association
for all who were interested to attend,
-there was a large crowd of people
who seemed interested in this associ
ation at the Commercial Club Tues
day evening. It was very plain from
the start that Devils Lake'has a
large number of people who aire in
terested in seeing our Chautauqua
not only kept up but to grow and
prosper. Various ones talked and
while there was some criticism, most
of the speakers were of the opinion
that possibly the management had
done all possible under the circum
stances', as it is well known that the
association has not beep making
money enough to pay bills and keep
up the interest on the bonded- indebt
edness, and therefore were consider
ably hampered on that account, and
'had been compelled to put on the best
program they could with the meant
they had.
Most of the speakers seemed to be
lieve that it would be best' to get back
to the real Chautauqua idea and put
on a program acordingly. It is well
known that in past years we have
drifted somewhat from the original
-Chautauqua program, and among
some this has caused a dissatisfac
tion.

When it came to the matter of
Electing directors it was very evident
that well laid plans had been formul
ated and. that the large. number., of
proxies in evidence much interest had
been shown. Several names were
presented as candidates for directors
and when the smoke of battle had
cleared away it Was found that P. P.
Mann had been elected to succeed
himself and for the other two vacant
places D. V. Brennan and Siver Ser
umgard had been selected.
Some of those who spoke seemed
to feel that there should be a better
financial accounting, as no intelligent
report had been made of the trans
actions of the association. It wasL
however, determined that over $6,000
had been taken in at the session tills
year and thatthe program had cost
only about $2,000, the balance of
$4,000 going for various other' pur
P0868i
From the statement made it ap
pears that the Chautauqua: -i$ run
ning behind each year approximately
$800, and that if there was no in-,
terestto pay that there would be suf
ficient revenue /to, keep it going.
Various onegjwepe leaped upon to
'express themwves sJndRev. Stinson
seemod to thiru^that progi^nj or
attendance is ntft what was several
years ago and favored a shorter' and
more snappy program of a real Chau
tauqua nature. Rev. Oehler, who was
platforn) manager for the past two
years, seemed to think that the prog
ram had been fairly good, possibly
all that could be expected with the
means at hand. P. H. Hyland and
"Mrs. W. H. Reid expressed themselves
to the effect that lot holders who were
not stockholders should have some
thing to say, and many seem to think
that they are right. Among the other
speakers were Siver Serumgard, L. J.
Wehe, Mrs. Elizabeth Preston Ander
son and F. P. Mann. Mr. Mann, who
.has been one of the ardent boosters
'of this institution, seemed to think
that the Commercial club of this city
should contribute a certain
each year to keep it up. He contended
that the Chautauqua is one of the
best assets the city of Devils Lake
has—and there is no question but
what he is right—and that the people
should take an interest in it and help

it financially through the commercial
club.
The meeting until after midnight,
and nearly all lasted who were there
remained until the finish. Whether
this meeting will be for the better
ment of the Chautauqua or not, there
is one thing sure and that is that fo.
once Pres. Kelly succeeded in getting
together a real meeting.
Rolla, N. D., Aug. 15.—Carl Bern

and thirteen years -of age, was
drowned at Jarves lake. Carl and
two other boys of about the same age
got into a boat, Carl having removed
his clbtfteg for the puipose of taking
They rowed a short distance
from the shore when Carl dived into
theater from the end of the boat,
and- never came to the surface again.
Becoming alarmed, the boys pulled
for t|e. shore and called for help.
Warden S. Cain and others soon aU
rived ^nd made desperate efforts to
find the body, but were unable to
discover it for nearly two hours as
the two boys who were in the boat
were Excited and could not locate the
place of. the accident. When found
the body was only a short distance
from the shore in four feet of water.
A physician, who was spending the
day at Fish lake, examined the body
but found that life was extinct. A
telephone mesage was sent to County
Coroner M. S. Mangan at Rolla, who
drove at once to Jarves lake. After
inquiry, Mr. Mangan decided that an
inquest Was unecessary as it was
plainly a case of accidental drowning.
It is thought that the boy became
stunned when he struck the bottom of
the lake and lost all control of him
self.
REV. F. H. OEHLER
MAKES STATEMENT
Editor of The World:—
I happened to be in Fargo last
Thursday, when Mr. Hughes, Republi
can candidate for President of the
United States, spoke in the Auditor
ium of that city. I am in no sense a
partisan, although I have usually vot
ed the Republican National ticket.
Above all I like to see fair play, and
therefore I would like to correct what
may be a misunderstanding with re
gard to that Fargo meeting of Mr.
Hughes. I scarcely think it just to
call it a "frost," as the Auditorium
was filled to its capacity, and hundreds
were turned away. In a speech last
fifty minutes the speaker was ap
plaiMtf twenty-ninev times, and at
times *qciorously. Whether one
agreed with er. Hughes or not, it can
not be denied that he held the closest
attention of his hearers. His style is
unadorned, and as forceful as it is
clear. There is no beating about the
bush, no appeal to the gallery", no
rhetorical flourishes, and the most'
dense cannot fail to understand his
drift. But what impressed me the
most was the evident sincerity and
fearlessness of the man. It was not
the speech of a smooth politician, and
if I am not mistaken he would be a
difficult person for politicians to han
dle. I can now understand why the
so-called "(did guard" did not want to
see him nominated, but were compell
to do so, if they wished to defeat one
whom they disliked more. Whoever
is elected President, apart from any
consideration of policies and methods,
a high-minded man will occupy the
White House.
Yours truly,
P. H. OEHLER.

Duell at New Rockford.
MAN SLAIN BY HAIL
IN NORTH DAKOTA
ANDREW ERICK&ON DIES NEAR
RULETTE FROM EFECTS OF
POUNDING HE RECEIVED IN
STORM.
Kehtmare, N. D., Aug. 11.—One per
son is dead and thousands of acres of
grain are said to have been hailed
out by a storm which swept Northern
North Dakota last night.
Andrew Erickson, farmer living
near Rolette, was caught in an open
field by the hailstorm and was pound
ed into ^unconsciousness. He died a
few moments after he had been found
lying in the field by persons who went
hunt for him.
Kenmare, Rolette, Norma, Bowbells
Portal, Rugby, Glenburn, Crosby and
Toley are among the isolated points
reporting damage from the storm.
The medical men of the Lake Re
gion held a very interesting meeting
at the city hall Tuesday evening.
There was a good attendance and
from start to finish it was a most in
teresting meeting. Among the pa
pers read was one of Dr. Lamount of
the Dunseith sanitarium, the topic be
ing tuberculosis. Dr. Herron of Tol
na presented a case of glandular
fever, and Dr. Drew a very interest
ing paper on a complicated case of
eye trouble. Discussions on various
subjects were had, and after the meet
ing was over there was a banquet at
the Colonial hotel.
Members present were: Drs. La
mount and Lemieux, Dunseith Rob
erts and McDonald, Cando Swenson
and Philips, Bisbee Wydmeyer art1
Verret, Rolla Bu,ssen, Baker Carter,
Warwick Herron, Tolna Lohrbaur,
Lakota Fawcett, Starkweather
Cuthbert, Crary McGurren, Hors
man, Sihler, Peppard, Drew and Mc
intosh of Devils Lake.
When one considers how much less
subject a disease grass and some other
crops are than wheat, and how stock
can be fed successfully after a hail
storm has put the grain crop out of
running, it ought to cause some of the
farmers to look more favorably upon
clovenhoofed farm animals.

While playing about the Chautau
qua grounds yesterday afternoon the
young 12 year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
S. A. Hann had a narrow escape from
death. There is a stone gasoline
house near the ticket office at Chau
tauqua, and the escaping gas has
made it dangerous for anyone to re
main in this place for any length of
time. Young Hann went in there for
some purpose and remained too long
and was overcome by the gas. Some
other boys who saw him enter, the
place became suspicious that some
thing was wrong and notified Chas.
Kennedy and Mr. Kennedy went to
the building and found the boy uncon
scious. He was immediately remov
ed to the open air and was taken to
the General hospital in this city,
where he was given proper attention
and at this time he is considered out
of danger. Had he remained there
much longer he would have lost his
life. We understand the place has
been closed so that there will be no
danger of other boys having the
same experience.
VOTE TO DEMAND
$1.50 FOR WHEAT
Several Million Bushels Will
Reaped But of No Grade,
Be
Fargo, Aug. 16.—That North Da
kota farmers should hold their wheat
for $1.50 a bushel was the recom
mendation adopted by 75 grain grow
ers in sesion here yesterday. Twenty
six counties in North Dakota and sev
eral in Minnesota and Montana were
represented. John M. Anderson,
president of the Equity Co-operative
Exchange of St. Paul, presided.
Several gave their experiences in
wheat raising and the cost of produc
tion was gone over thoroly. That the
cost was not the same in all counties
and for all those present was shown
in the figures submitted.
Costs $1.25 to $2 Per Bushel.
While some showed they could
raise a bushel of wheat at a cost of
$1.25, others proved that it cost them
as high as $2.
None of those preset ventured to
estimate what the wheat yield will be
this y€ar It was stated there will
be Several million bushels shipped
from North Dakota this year but
practically all of no grade.
"North Dakota will raise several
million bushels of macaroni wheat
and some marquis wheat, but I doubt
if there will be 10,000 bushels of No.
1 northern wheat," said President
Anderson of the Equity Exchange.
Discuss Livestock Shipping.
A resolution was adopted asking
the Equity Exchange to devise ways
and means to get proper seed wheat
next spring. Another resolution
adopted asks farmers not to sell
wheat held over from last year's
crop.
The marketing of livestock was
discussed and it was decided to push
the organization of shipping associa
tions over the state. Several live
stock men made short addresses and
answered questions.

Previously the house had refused to
adopt a continuing building program,
had authorized only five capital ships,
all of them batle cruisers, and had
provided for a personnel of only 65,
000.
Expect Early Agreement
On several less important sections
including appropriations for improve
ment of navy yards, the house insist
ed on its disagreement to senate in
creases and voted to send the bill
back to conference for settlement of
these points.
An early agreement is expected,
hWever, and the measure may be
sent to the president for his signa
ture within a week.
Biggest Building Bill.
Secretary Daniels issued a state
ment tonight pointing out that the
building authorizations in the bill
were the greatest ever passed in any
country and would give the United
States, in the opinion of naval au
thorities, the second largest navy in
the world.
He declared the program so com
plete and nearly perfect that it
stand as a model for all navy bills in
future legislation.
Non-partisan Vote

cepted the senate increase in the
building program was hoh-partisan,

During the debate on the building-
program, the republicans insisted *t««t
they had led the way toward increases
and that the administration was not
entitled to all of the credit.
The time alloted opponents of the
big program was controlled by Demo
cratic Leader Kitchin, who charged
the democrats with a sharp change of
front.

MEN ARE NOT KEEN FOR A

Should the efforts of those now try

men in the United States prove fruit
less, it is estimated that between 800
and 1,000 trainmen who have homes in
St. Paul will be thrown out of employ
ment. In addition to these there are
many more whose runs terminate in
St. Paul and who spend from two to
four days of each week here.
That trainmen here and in the
Northwest hope a strike will be avert
ed is the opinion of those in touch
with local labor conditions.
