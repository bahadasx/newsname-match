The First Primary
We give below as much of the
election returns from the Nor
thern Supreme Court District
and the Fourth Congressional
District as we were able to get
with the facilities at our com
mand. The vote here given is
incomplete and may be very
erroneous, but the results indi
cated by these returns will not
likely be materially changed.
The latest returns indicate
ihat Sykes has a lead over Knox
of about 2200. Sisson's majority
is about 600. All the old Con
gressmen go back by majorities
ranging from 600 to 4000. In
the middle district Potter and
Ethridge are in the run-off with
the latter in the lead.

Rid the Farm of Weeds
WE WANT
Every body in the county to get
some of our money. If you do
not it will be your fault. Bring
us your Bones, Iron, Rags, Books
and Magazines. Large crowds
have been to see us every day.
Get in the push and come to.
Clean up your place and turn the
waste into cash.
We will stay here as long as
we get good business.

By J. D. Newton, Prop.
By preventing this years crop
of weeds from reseeding them
selves a long step will have been
taken toward ridding the pastur
es and fields of weeds. This is
the suggestion 'recently offered
to Mississippi farmers by J. M.
Beal, of the Mississippi A. & M.
College, who states that by ob
serving the following rules many
noxious weeds, such as bitter
weed; giant rag weed, cockle
burr, and cypress weed, may be
practically eradicated in one or
two seasons.
1. Allow no weed seed to
ripen.
2. Kill weeds in the tender
seedling stage.
3. Induce fall sprouting by
giving a late cultivation.
4. Burn wood3 bearing ma
ture seeds. Never plow them
under.
5. Thoroughly compost stable
manure if contaminated with
seeds of noxious weeds.
6. Sow only pure seed.
7. Watch for weeds new to
your locality.
8. Practice rotation of crops.
9. Turn weeds into pork,
beef, and mutton by grazing
them.
10. Plant smothering crops.
