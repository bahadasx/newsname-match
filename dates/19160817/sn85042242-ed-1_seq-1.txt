London, Aug. 16.—The French and
British striking with terrific force in
three directions on the Somme front
have stormed nearly' three miles of
German trenches, driving forward at
a point to a depth of 300 to 500 yards.
The most important gains iwere made
iby the British and French troops
striking north and west of where the
allied lines meet. iMerepas and Cler­
gy, two of the most important points
held by the Germans in this sector,
have been flanked on both sides, ac»
cording to the official statement is­
sued by Paris.
iNearing Combles.
The road has also been reached 'be­
tween iMarepass and Gtyillemfint, th§,
latter town being the' immediate ob­
jective pf the British. This advance,
if mainlined, brings the Allies di­
rectly in front of. the large railroad
town of .Gom'bles.
South of the Somme, the French
stormed. German trenches over a
length of about three-quarters of a
mile, driving forward ill a southerly
direction' frpm J3elleoy-enjSanterre.
Paris renorjia that a. considerable
number of prisoners were taken in
these operations.
Quiet on Russian Front.
For the first time in many days,
no important action is reported from
the Russian front and the same
dearth of news prevails in regard to
the Italian operations. The most in­
teresting items of news in regard to
the Italian advance against Trieste
is contained in a news dispatch from
Milan, which says that German troops
are to foe employed in defense of the
big Austrian iports. If they co-oper
ate, this, means that Italy and Ger­
many jyill at last enter an actiye state
of war.
Again, Berlin reports .fighting at
Doiran, on the Saloniki front, but
Paris and London maintain their si­

this theatre.

JO SELL AB
11.60 BUSHEL
Terminal Price of'No. 3 Grade
Is Agreed on by The
Farmers,
WILL HOLD GRAIN
FOR FIXED PRICE
Fargo, iN. D., Aug. 16.—Farmers of
the Dakotaas, Montana and (Minneso­
ta will not sell No. 3 spring wheat
for less than $1.60 a 'bushel, terminal
price, if they follow the recommenda­
tion of their delegates, who closed a
session today. No. 1 and 'No. 2 grades
will not be sold at any prices, all of
this being retained for seed.
This was the word that went out
today ,from the Society of Equity
headquarters
sat
Fargo and St. Paul
to farriiers in northwestern states,
following the conference here yes­
terday, attended by 60 farmers of
innesota, South Dakota, and North
Dakota, at-which fully a thousand re­
ports' covering the cost of wheat pro­
duction were considered.
The grain growers' division of the
Society of 'Equity, 'of which J. M. An­
derson of St. Paul is- president, will
make an activ# campaign among
farmers to hold their grain for the
price they have fixed in the cose of
No. 3 Northern and the following
other prices, all at terminal prices:
Oats, No. 3 white, 50c durum wheat,
No. 2, $1.50 barley, No. 2 feed 90c
flax, $2.25 rye, $1.20.
Charging grain manipulators with
forcing the iprice of wheat down dur­
ing the marketing season in other
years, the grain growers say they
have set these prices as a means of
combating grain exchanges.
WIFE MORE POWERFUL

Judge C. A. Nye.
Mrs. Mack dif not appear at the

resulted in his obtaining a separation
Mr. and Mrs. Mack were married
in 1912 and since then have lived on
their farm near Glyndoft. Mrs. Mack
is ten years the senior ot her husband
and, according to. the testimony yes­
terday, she is a great deal more pow­
erful, not only in muscular strength,
but in her command of

by
a
dhartefrnrillionfelB the
opinion of C.
A. I*: Turner, of Minneapolis, Chicago
and New York, designer of some of
America'8 most famous bridges, and
who spent a day in Bismarck this
week looking into the possibility of
spanning the Big Muddy.
Mr. Turner's figures are from $&0,*
000 to $150,000 lower than other esti­
mates received to date. He regards
his estimate as very conservative, and
is ot the opinion that the maximum
named will serve not only to complete
the bridge, but may care for the ap­
proaches at either side.
The big bridge engineer does not
favor a suspension type for the Mis­
souri. He admits that it would be
cheaper than any other form of con­
struction. At the same time, he has
found it to lack the stability and per­
manency of the cantilever type.
Mr. Turner is thoroughly familiar
with the Missouri. As consulting en­
gineer for the Soo Line, he has de­
signed all of that company's spans for
the last sixteeh years, and recently
prepared rians fw4bei« ?ISQ
over the MissouTl WfaichsJs to link the
proposed extension wesP And north
from Sanish. One of his late struc­
tures is the half-million-dollar bridge
over the iSt. Croix river at Sommerset.
The famous aerial bridge at Duluth is
a Turner creation, and his plans were
accepted just before the war depres­
sion reached northwestern Canada for
a $2,000,000 bridge across the Nar­
rows at Vancouver.
The bridge architect believes that if
contracts for the Missouri span could
be let next year and an allowance of
at least two years pr6vided for the
delivery of steel, a saving of $50,000
to $60,000 over present prices of struc­
tural fabric could be effected. He does
not believe it feasible to endeavor to
complete such a project within less
than two years after the beginning of
operations.
Should Burleigh and Morton coun­
ties decide to bond for the erection of
this bridge, as they are permitted to
do by special acts of legislature, it is
probable that state and federal aid
might be procured, under the terms of
the Shackelford good roads bill,
which recently became a law. There
would also be a bare possibility of as­
sistance from the war department.
Barring any assistance from these
sources, it is said that the interest
charges on the bonds would be but
$5,000 per annum for each county, or
less than the city of (Bismarck alone
now pays annually into the Burleigh
county road fund. If the bridge were
operated on a toll basis and only a
nominal fee charged, such as has been
exacted for years on the Bades bridge
over the Mississippi at St. Louis,
those familiar with such projects
claim that the interest charges and
something to apply on the principal
easily could be earned.
Mr. Turner is much interested in
thd possibility of a wagon bridge be­
ing built here, and he believes that he
could easily procure bids within the
maximum cost which he has named.
Both the Mandan and the Bismarck
commercial clubs have bridge com-,
mittees which have had this import­
ant problem under consideration for
some time, and there is some proba­
bility of an active campaign being
opened on the Mandan side.

Infantile Paralysis.
MATTER TO BE TAKEN
UP IN DETAIL
Washington, Aug. 16.—What offi­
cials regard as one of the most im­
portant medical conferences in the
country's history will meet here to­
morrow to discuss means of combat­
ting infantile paralysis.
Health authorities from 38 states,
officials of the federal public health
service, and many leading scientists
will exchange views on methods of
treatments and prevention, and will
work out a more definite scheme of
co-ordinating their campaign against
the disease. Representatives of vari­
ous railroads will also be present for
consultation on the question of check­
ing a further territorial spread.
Officials here have insisted there is
no occasion for fearing a panic or
that the health service has become
thoroughly aroused by the persist­
ence of the disease in spite of the
best efforts of local and federal offi­
cials. The outbreaks have presented
many methods baffling to scientists,
and there are questions relative to
the origin, transmission and control
of the disease on which authorities
differ widely.
Issues Statement
All of the subjects will be gone
over in detail at the conferences,
which probably will last two days.
This statement regarding its purpose
was issued tonight at the treasury de­
partment, which has the health ser­
vice under its jurisdiction.
"The conference is made necessary
by the seriousness of the infantile
paralysis situation, and is considered
one of the most important confer­
ences of this sort ever held. Consid­
eration will be given to the prevention
of the interstate spread of the dis­
ease, ^research problems, symptomat­
ology epidemiology, general princi­
ples of control and the relation of the
after care of infantile paralysis pa­
tients. One of the most important
points that will come up for discus­
sion undoubtedly will be the preven­
tion of the Interstate spread of the
disease."
In his call for the conference, is­
sued August 9, General Surgeon Blue
asked each state to send one repre­
sentative. 'Fourteen secretaries of
state health boards are among those
who have been resignated to attend,
while twenty-four other states have
designated chief health officers,
health commissioners or other offi­
cials to represent them.

will be a renewal of the surface car
strike, together with t* complete tie
up' of the subwa:y and elevated rail­
way lines in this city, as threatened
in an ultimatum iby a committee of
employes, was said to depend on the
result of a conference to 'be held to­
morrow morning between the men
and officials of the companies. The
situation has become so acute that
Mayor iMitchell and Oscar iS. Strauss,
chairman of the public service com­
mission, are said to have 'been sum­
moned 'back to the city, the former
from Plattsiburg, and the latter from
Maine.
Theodore F. Shonts, president of
the Interborough Rapid Transit and
the iNew York Railways companies,
in a letter addressed to the mayor
and Chairman 'Strauss tonight,^called
attention to the ultiniatuft delivered
to him by the employ^' c6mntlttee,
which charged that the 'New York
Railways companies had violated,the
agreement of August 7, which 'brought
the strike on surface car lines to an
end. Mr. 'Shonts denied that his com­
pany had discharged 'workers .because
of their affiliation with the carmen's
union, and -added that- '.'in many
cases employes of this company have
clearly violated the rules of this com­
pany, some of the violations increas­
ing the hazard and endangering the
safety of passengers on our cars."

New Bismarck Life Insurance
Company Writes Over a
Quarter Million.
Commencing business on June 12,
last, the Provident Insurance Com­
pany of Bismarck, North Dakota, or­
ganized for the writing of life insur­
ance, has just completed its first two
months' period with a business pro­
duction of considerably more than a
quarter of a million dollars. Inas­
much as the active organization of
the company's agency force was not
commenced until about July 1, practi­
cally all of this insurance has been
written during the past six weeks.
The officers are much pleased with
the results as at the same ratio as
the past two months, it indicates a
business volume the first year of
$2,000,000, which should be increased
with the rapid extension of its pro­
ducing organization.
The "Provident'" has been fortu­
nate in making agency connections,
which include some of the best
known bankers and business men in
the state, many of whom are stock­
holders, giving them an added inter­
est in the advancement of the com­
pany.
An active campaign for $1,000,000
of business during 1916, is the goal
sought by the officers and the outlook
indicates that this amount will be
reached.

Mercury Soars
All heat records for 1916 were
'beaten, when the weather man yes­
terday recorded a maximum of 97 de­
grees in the shade of a degree
higher than any previious day this
year.
The morning Was cool, after the
early shower, in which only enough
water fell to slprinkle the streets.
The temperature dropped from mid­
night to 7:00 a. m„ when the ther­
mometer registered 66.

It then began a sensational up­
ward movement, after the style set
,by wheat, and reached the 97-degree
Ibar at 3 o'clock.
Evening only ibrought a little re­
lief. The thermometer recorded 91
at 7:00 p. m.
The heat, however, was not felt
nearly as much as was the warm
weather earlier in the summer, and
few thought that the season's record
would ibe distanced.
No heat prostrations were reported
in Bismarck.

BUSINESS CONCESSSIONS
WILL BE QUESTIONED
Washington, Aug. 16.—Secretary
Lansing was asked today to appear
Friday before the senate foreign re­
lations committee to answer ques­
tions relating to the treaty for the
purchase of the Danish West Indies.
The committee, at its first meeting to
consider the treaty, decided a per­
sonal explanation from the secretary
would be necessary to satisfy some of
the members regarding details relat­
ing to business concessions In the
islands, and to the purchase price.
Some of the leaders on the com­
mittee, although they favor purchas­
ing the islands, believe the $25,000,000
asked by Denmark exhorbitant, espe­
cially in view of the fact that she of­
fered to sell them for $5,000,000 in
1902.
The committee will question Mr.
Lansing particularly, however, about
business concessions, which the Unit­
ed States, by terms of the convention,
proposes to maintain. Among these
area license to a company called "det
Ves Indiske Kompagnie, "giving it
rights to drain, deepen and utilize cer­
tain areas in St. Thomas Harbor, and
preferential rights as to commercial,
industrial, or shipping establishments
'in the harbor. Another concession
gives the same company the right to
supply electric lights for the city of
Charlotte Anlalie.
Senator Stone, chairman of the
committee, said tonight the treaty
.probably would not be reported to the
senate for ratification until next week.

SUMMONED
Men Believe Outlook Is Pavorablii
For Peaceful Settlement of
Difficulties.
Washington, Aug. 16.—President
Wilson today completed a definite
plan for settlement of the threaten^
nation-wide railroad strike and will
BUbmit it to the managers of the Mil*
roads and employees tomorrow. 41*
though administration! officials said
negotiations would be continued bntil
a peaceful solution was found, the
outcome of the president's mediation
is expeoted to depend largely on
attitude of the two sides toward tje
plan he has drawn up.
•:-A
'It
will be observed. Later, it proband
will be proposed that federal eon*
mission, appointed by the ptesld^nt
or created by congress, investigate
all problems which have arisen dur­
ing the present discussion.
The chief obstacles in the way oC
the acceptance of the plans lie in tiMf
Insistence of the railroad manage?*
for arbitration and their opposition to
an eight-hour day and their demand
for time and a half for overtime.
Whether the two sides will give in on
these two points constituted the chief
danger tonight.
General Committee Arrives.
The general committee of the em*
ployees, including 640 representatives
of the trainmen and englnemen on
the 225 railroad systems of the 'coun*
try, arrived here tonight in response
to a summons by the sub-committee,
which has been meeting with the
president. The general committee
has plenary powers to reject or ac«
cept any suggestions.
Is Favorable.
The men, although refraining from
discussing the plan of the president,
said the outlook was favorable for'a,
settlement.
At 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoOd
the president will meet the.general
committee of the 640 representativea
in the White House and lay his plin
before them. He will accompany it
with a statement appealing to their
patriotism and nrging a compromise
in the interests of the people, ot the
nation.
While no time has been set for a!
conference between the managers'
committee and the president,' it
it
thought probable it will take place
tomorrow morning.
Will Lay Same Plan.
When Mr. Wilson seesi the managv
ers he will make practically the aa$«
statements he will deliver to' fhe Mi*
ployees, paying particular attention*
however, to the points he feels the
managers should concede. The yres
ident completed his plana In a con*
ference today with Judge Wm. J.
Chambers, of the federal board of
mediation and conciliation, who took
to the White House statistics compil­
ed by experts, showing the probable
cost to the railroads by granting the
basic principle of the eight-hour day.
iDuring the day Judge Chambers tatt­
ed with the managers' committee, its
did not talk with the employees' re»
presentatives.
The conference between the preiT
dent: and Judge Chambers waa the
only formal meeting of the dap tm
connection with the. situation^
Depending On PuMie Opinion.
The president is depending largely
on public opinion to fofce a aeTtle
