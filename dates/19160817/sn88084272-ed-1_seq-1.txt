President Hasn't Time
To Sign Commissions
Of Promoted Officersnt??&t?.
Washington. D. C. Aug 17 Because
the president has been unable to find
time to sign the 1000 or more officers'
commissions piled upon his desk, the
completion of the army reorganization
under the recently created law has been
delayed. Until the commissions are
signed, the officers have no autohrity
to exercise the functions of their rank.
Army officers are recommending the
passage of special legislation permit
ting the commissions to be signed by
some person other than the president.
It is pointed out that if a volunteer
army of 500.009. with 50.000 officers
were raised it would take the president,
the secretary of war and the adjutant's,
generals whose names must appear on
the commissions, nine full working days
each to carry out their part in the
purely routine matter.

Limit Work To 6 Hours Daily
Union Men Present Petition
to City Council; Mayor
Given 10 Days' Leave.
The street car strike situation came
up at the council meeting Thursday
morning in two petitions, one filed by
property owners along Rivera, and Pera
streets, the other by the Central Labor
union. Each petition charges that,
since the street car strike began the
street railway company is hiring inex
perienced men and claims that the pres
ent service is a menace to the lives of
the people. Wrecks and accidents are
cited in support of this contention.
The property" owners petition asks
that Pera and Rivera streets again be
opened and protests at their having
been closed. It is recited that the clos
ing of the streets forces the children
who walk to go around by the danger
ous canal or ride in street cars, which.
It is charged, are unsafe under the pres
ent conditions. The petition is signed
by 77 property owners.
Want Jitne Ilondu RemoTed.
The Central Labor union's petition Is
the same as that adopted Wednesday
night by the crovd attending "Mother"
Jones's speech in Cleveland Square. The
petition sets forth that, since the car
strike, the number of cars in use has
been decreased and that incompetent
men have been employed Three collis
ions with automobiles, a street car
wreck on the park line, two cars
wrecked on the smelter line and a rear
end collision on the park line are cited
as proof of this charge
It Is also charged that the nonunion
emplores are being armed and. on three
different occasions, are eald to have
fired at El Paso citizens without justifi
cation The alleged increase in the
number of damage suits against the
company also Is cited.
The petition then asks that the jitne
ordinances- be suspended or repealed,
thereby removing the requirements as
to bonds. No action was taken on the
petitions.
Mayor Gets Leave.
Mayor Tom Lea was not back from
his California trip and councilman R. B.
Stevens presided. The council voted to
extend the mayor's leave of absence ten
days.
A number of paving matters came up
for discussion and Richard F. Burges
and officials from the Rio Grande & El
Paso railway (the Santa Fe) protested
against the company being forced to
pay for the pavement of Davis street.
It was contended that this would cost
the railroad about J3600; that It would
derive no benefit from the work and
that there was little demand for such a
pavement.
W. W. Evans and C T. Kinne pro
tested against the paving of Cotton
avenue, contending that the expense
was not justified by the value of their
property.
To Pair tncr.
R. J Schmailhausen discussed the
question of paving Ange street, but
said he would enter no protest if the
other property owners believed pave
ment was needed. It was announced
there would be no car line on Ange
street because of the proximity of a
school house.

WHAT hae tbe wonderful achieements of the French 75 millimeter
gun in this war to do with the notorious case of Capt. Drevfu. which
shocked the world 20 rears ago? Did you know that count Esterharr
at last confessed his part in the plot and is still livins? Did vou know that
Col. Henri committed suicide when his part was discovered"? The whole
dramatic story of the persecution and martyrdom of Capt. Drevfus because
he was a .lew. has a direct bearing on the present terrible power of the
French artillery and the failure of the Germans to prepare in time to improve
upon it. In the Wetk-Knd Herald will appear a remarkable storv from the
pen of a Frenchman who knew the inside circumstances and the principal
actors ii the drama -the man to whom Esterhazv confessed. If T0U want to
see to what Icninhs race prejudice can go; if you want to learn something
about the methods of the French military proup; if you want to see what
persistent searching after facts and belie'f in the innocence of a friend can
sometime accomplish: if you want to refresh your memorv as to the manner
in ihieh France t'inalli made partial amends for her injustice, if vou want
to know where IVu.i. is now, and where the others are who fought him

marched along to the treasury depart

tary order and then proceeded to the
white house, where they went to the
east room. They planned to meet again
soon after seeing the president.
