RECORDPASTSEASON

Two Games are Tied Secures
182 Hits, Opponents 136.
SEASON CLOSED SUNDAY
WAS A FINANCIAL SUCCESS
Frank Leads Batting Averages for
Local Players Kannerberg and
White Pitch Good Ball.
The Bemidji baseball season which
closed Sunday was very successful,
both from a financial and sport view
point.
The proceeds of the games paid for
the baseball grounds and the new
grandstand and bleachers which were
constructed last spring, according to
M. Brown, president of the Ath
letic association
Play Good Ball.
Bemidji fans were able to witness
some excellent games and the Bemidji
team made a record of which the city
can be proud Previous to this sea
son Bemidji was one of the poorest
baseball towns in Northern Minne
sota, but this was due to the fact
that the city had not been represent
ed by a strong team for a number of
years.
The athletic park will be used by
the high school and city football
teams during the next few months
Already plans are being made for a
city eleven and it is believed a good
schedule of games will be arranged
All-Salaried Team?
No arrangements have been made
for the 1917 baseball season. It has
been reported that Bemidji will have
an all-salaried team next season. Ath
letic association officials stated today
that nothing would be done regard
ing the organization of the 1917
team until next spring Whether or
not some of the present players will
be retained is not Known.
