Two Accidents.
Last week, two autos turned
turtle on the mountains near Mc
Connellsburg. One was on Scrub
Ridge, and one was on the Cove
mountain on the east side near
the top. No one was seriously
hurt in either accident. Care
less driving was supposed to be
the cause in both cases. John
Barleycorn is strongly suspected
a3 having been a passenger in
one of the cars. State police are
riding the Lincoln Highway west
of this county, but we believe
the Bedford and Fulton county
mountains would afford a3. much
'game" for these men a3 would
any part of the Highway. Driv
ers naturally a little light in the
upper story try to cut too many
smart capers on these mountain
curves.
Rev. W. W. Spriggs, of the A.
M. E. church, Cito, was a wel
come visitor at the News office
Tuesday. The Reverend gentle
man filled Rev. Croft's preaching
appointments at Mt. Zion, Bed
ford Chapel, and Needmore last
Sunday and was greatly pleased
with the reception those good
people gave him. Rev. Spriggs
strictly all right, and well
worthy the respect, encourage
ment, and sympathy of every
body interested in tne betterment
of mankind.
funeral took place at her father's
home on Monday afternoon, and
interment was made in the Ev
erett cemetery.
For more than two years Miss
Blanche had diabetes, and on the
evening before her deatn, sne
became very ill, soon became un
conscious, and remained in that
state until death came. She was
a devoted member of the M. E.
Church, an active worker in the
Sabbath school and in the Ladies'
societies connected with the
church to which she belonged.

WHOLE FAMILY KILLED.
Relatives of Fulton Coaaij Families
Killed and Injured in Street Car
Wreck Near Johnstown.
Intermarriage has brought so
many of the Ribblatt and De
shong families residing in Johns
town, Pa., and vicinity into close
relationship, that it has been their
custom once a year to hold a
joint family reunion. As most
of the Deshongs in Cambria coun
ty owe their nativity to Fulton
it follows that many Fulton coun
ty people are in close touch with
this annual event. Last year it
was held on the L'Sth of August
at Island Tark Johnstown, and
Lincoln I. Deshong, Joseph M.,
G. E. and John F. Deshonfc-all
of Licking Creek township at
tended. Last Saturday wa3 the day
fixed for the event this year and
the party were aboard a trolley
enroute for South Fork. As they
were gliding joyously along a
run-a-way car from Ebensburg
came dashing down with light
ning rapidity and ploughed its
way through the car, containing
the excursionists causing the
death of twenty-six persons and
the injury of more than half a
hundred more..
Among the dead were Darrell
Deshong, his wife, and two chil
drenthe entire family. Darrell
is a son of the late Percy De
shong, a grandson of Jacob and
Rebecca (Strait) Deshong form
erly of Licking Creek township.
(Darrell's father was killed on a
railroad.) Two Bisters of Dar
rell's wife, Mrs. Robert Mc
Laughlin and Mrs. Bruce Ribb-
; lett were killed last Saturday
a3 wcll as the only two children
of Mrs. Bruce Ribblett. Her
brother,. Irvin Clark, was per
haps fatally injured.
David Deshong the eldest mem
ber of the Deshong family on the
car, was among the killed, . as
was. also. Joseph Ribblett, who

THE FLY AND EPIDEMICS.
Little Tsl!;s on Health cr.J Hjgieae bj
Samcc! C. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Reams have been printed about
the danger from the house fly.
Despite all that has been said it
is a self evident fact that people
do not understand how real is
the danger from these pests. If
they did, a single season would
be sufficient to wipe out the dan
gerous nuisances. Let people
once understand the part that
the fly plays in the transmission
of disease, and they will look up
on anyone who maintains a con
dition which breeds them as a
public enemy to be summarily
dealt with.
There is much wasted advice
about swatting the fly and trap
ping the fly. What we must
learn to do is to exterminate it
by doing away with all breeding
places.
Stables with manure piles that
are left for weeks, and garbage
dumps, and unscreened and care
lessly constructed outhouses are
the sources of the fly pest. Un
pleasant as this may be to con
sider it i3 true. Any community
which will bo able to free itself
from flies will eliminate these of
fensive features.
While it has not been definite
ly proven what the fly ha3 to do
with infantile paralysis, we have
good reason to believe that it
takes a part in the spread of the
disease. That they can, and do
carry the germs of typhoid fever
and other diseases we know. It
is a wise mother who screens her
baby's crib.
Thousands of children under
one year of age die annually who
would be saved if the fly were
eliminated.

THAT HARVEST HOSE.
Annual Picnic Affords Opportunity fcr
Exchange of Ideas, Keeping Step
With Inevitable Progress.
Common picnics, family reun
ions, and social gatherings of all
kinds are highly important func
tions in the life of any communi
ty; but in a distinctly agricultur
al district, a meeting like that
held in Sloan's Woods, last Fri
day, carries with it infinitely
greater possibilities than that of
partaking too freely of a good
dinner. The possibilities for co
operation cannot be measured.
Last Friday, speakers Jackson
Lighty, and Reisner sounded the
keynote of the situation when,
with evidently no. knowledge of
what their fellow speakers inten
ded to say, they each pointed out
the rapid changes in world mat
ters that reach out and down in
to the lives of all classes of indi
viduals, and in no case having
more direct effect than upon
farming communities. The
wheels of progreos cannot be
blocked by anything one class
may elect to do all must cither
move with that progress or suf
fer. Education, organizat i o n,
and co-operation are the three
stays upon which rests the future
of rural communities. Rev. Jack
son's reference to the present age
as one of re-construction was
well put. Lighty's reference to
the hornet's nest was so apt that
we repeat it below, and Reisner's
reference to tne necessity oi an
education fitted into the present
day conditions exactly.
Mr. Lighty endeavored to illus
trate his and other farmers' help
lessness in matters of legislation
as compared with the power ex
erted by organized business in
other lines. He compared the
farmers to bees, butterflies, and
all kinds of insects flying or liv
ing carelessly, though apparently
happy, along the roadsides. A
colored driver who was an ex
pert with his whip, amused him
self for miles by "shooting" all
these little creatures with the
snapper of his whip nevermiss
ing a bug, boo, fly or ether living
object at which he struck. Fi
nally, he and his salesman com-
Engineer Howard Hole Writes From
Nogaks, Arizona Under Date of
August Fourth.
We were sent from El . Taso
(or, rather Fort Bliss which, is a
suburb of El Paso) to Nogalea
(No-gollies) on the l(!th of July.
Our orders were to proceed with
all possible haste. We received
the orders at 7 o'clock in the eve
ning and before midnight we
were all "packed up" and on the
train ready to pull out. We were
commended very highly by the
commander of the Division for
our quick work. We broke camp
during a bad sand and wind
storm, and it might be noted in
passing that engineers in the
army reqjire more time to move
than any other division, owing to
the large quantity of equipment
carried. So, in making thi3 time,
we received "another star in our
crown."
We ere laying out a camp site
here fur General Tershing when
he returns from Mexico. Our
boys are working hard and have
solved problems that on sight
would seem impossible to the un
trained army engineer.
We build bridges with a ca
pacity of fifteen tons without
using a nail or a bolt. All timbers
are lashed with cable. Our work
is composed of building roads,
laying pipe lines, and drains,
the erection of shower baths, etc.
While it is hard work, it i3 very
interesting. Of course, one com
pany of ninety men cannot do all
the work, so we really do only
the overseeing and the other
troops, which comprise the mili
tia of California, Utah, Idaho
and Connecticut, do the labor.
We are also surveying and
mapping the country in this sec
tion. This work, which is very
accurate must all be done by us
without help. We don't know
how long wa will be kept here.
We may bo sent back to Texas
or some other place soon, as we
received orders to-day to use all
perishable food as soon as possi
ble, and all material which could
not be maved to be used in two
weeks.
I wish you could see the camps
along the bordershow neat and
sanitary they are kept; also, the
quantity of provisions required
to equip an army of a few thous
and troops. I am able now to
understand the report of the
European War costing so many
millions a day. And the equip
ment here is only the primary
equipment
Only wish I could tell you of
the work that is going on here,
but that is something I can re
veal to no one. I never couhl
understand how things were
planned, and all arrangements
made for the
army, weeks
fore it moved,
gineers are in
movement of an
or even years be
Eut as the en
charge of all this
I now understand how it is done.
Would like to tell you all about
our life as individuals, but it
would fill many pages.
I wish to acknowledge the re
ceipt of magazines from C. J.
Brewer, and the boys of Co. B,
a:e all very thankful for them.
With best wishes to all, I re

panion passed within reach of a
hornet's nest, and the traveling
man asked his driver why he did
not reach out for the nest. The
old darkey replied "NoSuh, dem
follows is organized."
Mr. Frank Ranck received the
plaudits of his fellow farmers
for having set out in the face of
threatened storm to bring a mem
ber of the State Board of- -Advisers
to the picnic Mr. Lighty, a
York county farmer who is an an

jects. ,
We compliment the committee
for the nice program and for the
smooth workings of same.
