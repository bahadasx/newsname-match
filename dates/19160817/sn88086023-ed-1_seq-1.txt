PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 17.
Charle.s K. Hughesi, before an audi
ence in the Ice Rink, here last n ght
assailed the democratic party for its
policy toward the Philippines.
"We cannot afford in this country
to lose sight of our national obliga-
tions,'' .Mr. Hughes said. "Our friends
on the other side were almost ready to
say that we should abandon the Phil
ippines. That was a matter of na
tional honor. We assumed obliga
tions there which we are bound to
j discharge.
"It is not so much a matter of self-
interest. I do not care so much
with respect to the argument of self
interest, liut when this nation un
dertakes before the world a responsi
bllity, it must discharge it.
"And we ought not to consider the
suggestion of scuttling out of the
i'hiiippincs to leave them in the pre
dicament which you know perfectly
well without my describing it.
the nominee reiterated his argu
ments for a protective tariff, for com
mercial preparation for the competi
tion with Europe after the war, for
"reasonable, adequate preparedness"
and repeated his declaration that the
democratic part was opposed to na
tional progress.
"Why. it I was s member of that
party and I speak with all good na
ture, because we are threshing things
( ut here now and looked through
the platforms of the past. I should
feel that I was going through a cem
etery richly embellished with monur
ments."
Mr. Hughes referred to the number
or unemployed in 1914, due largely,
he said, to the Underwood tariff.

Wilson Calls Presidents
of Eighteen Railroads
Action is Result of Managers1 Refusal to
Concede the Eight Hour Day-Pressure
is Brought to Bear to Submit Situation
to Arbitration.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. Wilton has proposed the im
mediate granting of an the eight hour day, the appointment of
a presidential commission to investigate the other demands.
The trainmen started a caucus immediately after the confer
ence. The leaders predicted they would overwhelmingly ac
cept Wilson 's plan.
WASHINGTON, Aug., 17. Six hundred forty of the
railroad brotherhoods general committee began entering the
White House at two forty five. A large crowd witnessed the
arrival. Before the meeting A. B. Garretson of the conduc
ters, received a copy of Wilson's proposal. It was only ten
lines. Garretson refused to discloie contents. Wilson met the
committee at three o'clock and personally read the proposal.
Five railway presidents left Chicago enroute to Washington
this afternoon in response to Wilscn's call. President Ripely
of Santa Fe did not go.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. Wilson long distance telephoned
President Willard of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad. He tele
graphed eighteen railroad presidents: "The discussion of mat
ters involved in the threatened strike has reached a point imag
ing it highly desirable that I personally confer with you at the
earliest possible moment. Hope you make it convenient to
come to Washington immediately."
Wilson's action was a result of the railroad managers refusal
to concede the eight hour day. Last night the managers urged
Wilson to submit the whole dispute to arbitration. Wilson's ar
guments did not move the managers. Several charged him
with attempting to delay settlement until after election. It is
learned the managers balloted against Wilson's proposal thrice
during the dast two days.
Six hundred and forty trainmen's representatives are here
ready to meet Wilson at three this afternoon. They secretly
conferred at the National hotel this morning.
The historical White House east room is prepared for the
session this afternoon. The gorgeous state furniture has been
removed. Camp chairs are crowded closely on the polished
floor. The definite terms of Wilson's proposal are not known.
The basic idea is an agreement whereby the eight hour day
becomes effective immediately.
Trainmens representatives were serious and silent as the
conference hour approached. They did not divulge what thev
were prepared to concede. They jammed the corridors of the
old time Pennsylvania avenue hotels. Their minds were ap
parently determined as there was little debating among them
selves. Federal Mediator Chambers brought the brotherhood heads
this morning a question from Wilson based on the managers
last communication refusing the eight hour dav. He remained
eight minutes and took the reply to the White House.
Wilson sent Chambers to ask the trainmen if the president's
attitude was thoroughly understood. He replied in the affirma
tive. One brotherhood leader said : "Evidentlv the managers in
tend to stand pat. We're willing, while the president is the
.judge between the parties. We intend to accept what Wilson
believes fair."
Another leader said a temporary settlement of major issues
was not acceptable. The district chairmen met at the Bijou
theatre early this afternoon.
NEW ()RK. Aug. 17. A dozen railway presidents leave
here at four this afternoon enroute to Washington in response
to Wilson's summons. Railway managers headtiiitirtcrs an
nounced that other presidents leave Chicago tonight, arriving
at Washington tomorrow.
