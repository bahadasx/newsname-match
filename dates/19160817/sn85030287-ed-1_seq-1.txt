' Who Owns Mexico?
'
A recent issue of La Follette's
Magtzine . contains an article,
signed by Senator LaFollette of
s Wisconsin entitled, "Who Owns
Mexico?" Ia view of the fact
Mr. Hughes devotes so Jarge a
proportion of bis speech of ac
ceptance to criticism of Presi
dent Wilson's Mexictn policy,
this notable article of Senator
" La 'Follett' acquires renewed
. interest aod is well worth read
ing by alt students of national
. 'politics, , ' " . ':' '''.' .,
' The 'Senator point out that
the amount of investments in
Mexico by United States capital
ists, speculators, and promoters
is $ 1057,770,000, while the
amount invested by Mexicans
themselves is reported as only
$793,187,242. This extraordi
nary fact, the Senator believes,
accounts largely for the demand
for "intervention" in. various
quarters.
Important parts of the article
are herewith reproduced;
"The people of the United
States do not want war with
Mexico. The Mexican people
do not want war with us, and
both President Wilson and Car
ranza have don everything in
their puwer to avert war..
What is it, th to, tbat menaces
the peace' of these neighboring
countries? .
It dates far back of the Colum
bus raid. Tbj)t outrage upon
the residents o one of our bor
der towns was: the-logical out-
come of conducts of which the
; Mexican people were in no wise
responsible. Worse than that!
The Mexican pewte were really
innocent ' victims of traitors in
our midst, for i is charged up
on the highest authority tbat the
raid was inspired and arranged
for in our own country!
Do you get the f uji meaning of
the statement? Btnedict Ar
nold was not more', guilty of
treason. J
The secret service ui in
government has a Jong arm an
a strocg arm. l ne net may ye
be drawn on the "higber-up". I
is fair to assume that President
Wilson did not disclose all cf the
facts in his possession when he
declared officially a few days af
ter the raid that:
"There were persons along
the border actively enga
creating friction betwee
government of the United States
and the de facto government of
Mexico for the purpose of b r i n g -
ing about intervention in the in -
terest of certain owners of Mex -
i
lican proper ties."
There you have it! The genua's
tlemen who want war with Mexlter
ico are the gentlemen . wh-

, Auto Accident
Frank Gates and Earl Ray
mond, a Ford and a hay rake,
made a rather undesireable com
bination, when the rake and the
Ford came in contact Monday
night about eleven o'clock, some
where in the neighborhood of
the Artesian school house. The
boys' were in Mr. Gates' Ford
and were driving west. Atsome
point along the road they met a
man driving a team hitched to
a big wagon. From the report
we' get, fee failed to give half the
road. ' Frank Gates, who was
driving the car, turned to the
right sufficient distance to pass
tbt wagon, but the dust raised
by the horses and the wagon
made it impossible for him to
see tbat a rake was hitched on
behind it and that it extended
out several feet. The result is
easily guessed: The car was
overturned and the occupants
thrown out but fortunately, not
hurt. The Ford and the rake
both were quite badly wrecked.

entry of sufficient land in any of
said States, not contiguous to
his original epry, to;inake-up
320 acres.-' p- "'' V'V y
The land embraced in the ad
ditional entry must be cultivat
ed in accordance with the three
year homestead law, bat, if with
in 20 miles of the original entry,
residence need not be maintain
ed on the additional if the entry
man owns and resides. on his
original entry when he makes
the additional and continues '
such ownership and residence
until proof ia made on the addi
tional. If the additional entry '
is more than 20 miles from the
original, or if the entryman does
not own and reside on the origin
al entry, residence must be main
tained on the additional entry.
The benefits of this act may
be claimed by a peron who has
perfected more than one home
stead entry, but the aggregate '
area of the land thus applied for,,
is limited to 320 acres.
No person who has made an ad
ditional entry under the enlarg
ed homestead law, nor can any
person make such entry if be
has not made fir al proof on his
original entry.
.No person can make an addi
tional entry.if the tract applied."

Before any entry under this
law can be allowed the land em
braced in both the original and
the additional entries must be

ed to mean land which, as a rule
lacks sufficient raiofall to pre- '
duce crops without resorting to
unusual methods of cultivation,
such as "dry farming," and for
which there is nb known source
of water supply from which such
land may be successfully irri
gated at a reasonable cost. If the

their designation.

larged homestead law applies

do, Kansas, Montana, Nevada,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Or
egon, South Dakota, Utah, Wash
ington, and Wyoming. -
