T110 annual re-union of Confederate
.terans of Hender30n county at Lau
IJt Park last Thursday drew a large
IrUd cf town aad county people,
rphe exercises were held in the Casino
which had been decorated for the oc
raion with the large Confederate
.nt fevers
Rev. A. I. Justice, chaplain of the
Alarcraret Davis Hayes Chapter of U.
1 c, opened the program with prayer.
The Hendersonville band interspersed
the exercises with thrilling Southern
muic which added much to the en
thusiasm of the day. Mr. Ben Clayton;
a visiting veteran from Asheville, play
ed - Dixie' on his violin in the good
old fashioned way, to the delight of his J
old comrades and tne enure auaienc.
McKinlty Pritchard.. Esq., of Asheville,
delivered the address of the day, and a
splendid and appropriate address it
vas. Among other things he told the
following anecdote illustrating the
tender heart of the peerless leader.
Robert E. Lee, as told by a northern
so'dier who was wounded at tne
battle of Gettysburg: "I was badly
w ounded."' says the soldier, "a ball had
shattered my left leg. I lay on the
ground not far from Cemetery Ridge
and as General Lee ordered his retreat,
he and his officers rode near. As he
came along I recognized him, and
though faint from exposure and loss
of bleed., I raised up both my hands,
looked General Lee in the face and
shouted as loud as I could, 'Hurrah
for the Tnion. General Lee heard me,
looked stopped his horse dismounted
and came toward me. I confess that
at first 1 thought that he was going to
kill me; but as he came up he looked
at me with such a sad expression on
his face, all fear left me and I won
dered what he was about. He extend
ed his hand to me, grasped mine firm
ly looked right into my eyes and said,
'My son, I hope you will soon get well
"If I live a thousand years," says the
relator of this incident, "I will never
forget the expression on General Lee's
face. Here he waa, defeated, retiring
from the field that had. cost him and
his cause almost their last hope, yet
he 'stopped to say words like this to a
wounded soldier of the opposition who
had taunted him as he passed by. As
soon as the General had left me I cried
myself to sleep there :on the bloody
battle field.' The combination of
strength and gentleness in Lee Was
without counterpart, for truly,
' The bravest are the tendest,
The loving, are the daring."
Mr. Pritchard also paid the follow
ing tribute to Southern womanhood:
thinks that whTn ',, "SSJ
Southern woman, he sent his angel3
out into star-strewn realms of space
and bade them gather all there .was of
heauty, brightness, honor and virtue,
and when they returned and had laid
aown their sheaves at the Master's
feet, God in all his omnipotence creat
ed a distinct type, the Southern wo
man, the embodiment of honor, purity
and virtue, of what-so-ever things ere
lovely."
ronowing the mornings program!
the old soldiers were lined up and
marched to the bountiful spread on a
table especially prepared for them.
After dinner the veterans held their
business meeting, J. P. Johnson, of
Horse Shoe, president, presiding. They
elected the following officers for the
i"suing year: J. F. Shipman, presi
dent; J. K. Hale, vice president; W. G.
Gullick, secretary and treasurer. They
also voted to meet at Laurel Park

E. B. Wooten, Fonnjr Manager of the
Old Wheeler HoteJ, to Take '
Charge November 1.
The largest ral estate deal consum
ated during the present season was the
sale of the Kentucky Home to E. B.
Wooten, of Columbia. The transaction
was handled through the real estate
firm of Smith, Jackson & Morris last
Thursday. The purchase .price is said,
to have been $32,500. and Mrs. A. M.
Goverb the former. owner is to relin
quish possession November 1.
This fine hotel was built by Mrs.
Gover some ten years ago. Owing to
the rapid increase every year of pa
tronage she found it necessary to make
additions.. Mrs. Gover has won fame
all over-the South for the bountiful
table and excellent service she has ren
dered her guests. Kentucky Home has
always been the first of Henderson
ville's hotels to fill with guests at the
beginning f the season and the last
to feel the close of the season.
About seven years aS extensive ad
dition were made to the hotel and new
furnishings "were placed throughout.
Last year many rooms were added
With private baths and other improve
ments were installed making it a mod
ern hotel in every sense of the word.
Mrs .Gover has done a great deal to
sustain Hendersonville's reputation as
j a summer resort and no better proof of
this.fact can be found than that many
of her guests have been coming here
every season for ears past.
E. B. Wooten, of Columbia, is no
stranger to the business men of Hen
dersonville. He managed Wheeler
rotel here during the season of 1914
and has been spending a part of sev
eral seasons with his family here. He
is an experienced hotel man, being now
manager of the Imperial hotel in Co
lumbia. In talking of the deal Mr. Wooten
said that the thing which influenced
him most was the progressive city of
Hendersonville and next he felt that
with" the reputation of the hotel he was
buying he could not see but that he
wa? making a valuable investment.
Mrs. Gover will remain with the ho
tel some- time. She did not sell her
handsome bungalow in the rear of the
hotel and has not announced her. plans
for the future.

Board of Trade: Condemns
Action Co. Commissioners
A splendid meeting of the Hender
sonville Board of Trade was held 'in
the rooms vof that organization Mon
day night. Although the attendance
was not so large, he meeting was en
thusiastic. Besideg the regular routine business
and reports, a resolution was passsed
condemning the act of the board of
commissioners of Henderson county
instructing Judge Bly the, county at
torney, to institute suit against George
Stephens of Charlotte, owner of Kanu
ga Lake And Club, for damages to the
bridges of the county that lay in the
path of the wateTS of tlfe. lake- when
they were Teleased by the breaking of
the dam.
.'It was felt by the board of trade that
Kanuga has been a valuable asset to
Hendersonville and that Mr. Stephens
was in no way responsible for the loss
of the bridges, as the breaking of the
dam was beyond his control. Although
suit has not yet been started against
Mr. Stephens by the Henderson com
missioners he ba$ been notified
through Attorney Blythe that such a
suit-would be' commenced at some fn
ture date. - v ' ... . ,
An interesting feature of the meet

' Following tfie breaking of the dam
Sunday evening and the . consequent
darining of the lake, the Toxaway Inn
has been closed for the season.
Mr. Jordan Rushing
Worn on Mill Dam
It took W. C. Jordan only a few
seconds to-make up his mind just what
he was going to do, after looking over
his wrecked flour mill, rendered so by
the breaking of his big dam during the
flood of July 17. He decided that the
quicker he could reconstruct his dam
and place back a part of the machin
ery which had been washed down the
stream, the quicker he could keep the
growing trade for "Purity" flour gup
plied. Mr. Jordan secured a large force ft
men and at once began the building of
a concrete wing of his dam and some
abutments for the big steel water
wheel which was" torn away during the
flood. He is overseeing the work him
self and thinks that his mill will be
running sometime this month.
"Purity" flour' has won quite a repu
tation, in the hpmes of many Hender-r
son county people. They are no doubt
eager to begin using this county pro
duct again. Mr. Jordan is well pleas
ed with the way in which his flour;
both white and graham have been sell
ing. As soon as his mill begins opera
tion again a sample sack of flour will
bL distributed among the housewives
who are not using "Purity" flour.

Last Plank Laid in Bridge Over Gren
- River Sunday Afternoon Road
in Good .Shape.
After being closed to the public 27
days the Spartanburg-Hendergonville
highway was finally opened to automo
bilists and aravelers last Saturday af
ternoon when the last plank was laid
on the new wooden bridge over Green
river. ,
The first reports after the July flood
stated that this valuable scenic high
way was entirely washed away in Hen
derson and Polk counties; but upon
investigation it was found that with
considerable work the road could soon
be opened for travel. Bob Stepp, one
of the county's efficient road overseert.
was sent with a large force of hands
to clear, the away the debris. Another
force of menwas put on the recon
struction of the Green River bridge!
The fine steel bridge was carried awa-y
in the flood. One of the abutments
gave way and the structure fell into
the river.
Large timbers were' hewed out and
in a short time a bridge was swung
across beautiful Green river. Rt.ror"
b races have been put on the sides pi
the bridge making it absolutely safe
for automobiles, r
The -Polk county end of the highway
was opened about the same time as
the Henderson county part. It is said
that a portion of the road in Polk
county had to be , entirely " rebuilt.
Private contributions aided in the work
considerably in Polk. Spartanburg
cars arrived here Sunday and Monday
over this road.

Had Been "Weakened by Recent Heavy
Rains Small Damage Done
Through South Carolina.
Lake Toxaway, the largest and most
beautiful of the artificial lakesIn Wes
tern North Carolina, is no more, the
waters having been released Sunday,
evening by the breaking of the large
dam, erected at a cost of about $38,000.
The dam was 50 feet high, 400 feet
long, and held v back waters covering
550 acres of ground. The lake wa3
noted for its scenic beauty and its
shore line was 15 miles in length. The
total damage is estimated at $58,000.
No loss of iif e is reported as a resul
of the breaking of the dam; but a re
port from Greenville says much dam- -age
was done to crops along S'eneca
river before the waters spread out over
the low country sufficiently to lose its
force. Brown's hotel on White rivet
was partially flooded by back water
and in several instances homes along
the Toxaway or Keowee rivere were
injured although there is no report of
any washing away.
The lake was well stocked with the
finest salmon in the south and moun
tain trout and bass, and . was famous
for its splendid fishing. ' iLany fine
specimens were found stranded in tho
bed of the lake after the water had
gone out. Only a stump field, cover
ed with mud and slime is now where,
the lake once was. '
The dam' built in 1902. at a cost of
$38u000, was constructed at a point
where the hills are not more than 400
feet apart. Over this dam the waters
of Lake Toxaway River flowed down a
narrow and densely wooded gorge for
a distance of 16 miles of comparative-
ly uninhabited country before empty
ing into the Chuga River and striking
the first towns in its' path in South
Carolina, 3;500 feet below the Toxaway
section.
There have been no unusual rains
in the lake section for several days,
but it is ' thought that the dam was
weakened by . the heavy rains which
flooded Western North Carolina dur
ing the week of July .16. This is the
third and largest of the lakes in the,
mountains of Western North Carolina,
which have gone out since the July
storms."; 12:f&i :

Four weeks ago during the flood
period, fears for the safety of the Tox

and there were several reports that
the dam had gone out.

OetoI)r Best Month in
Mountains, Say Many
Prolong the season.
This is rapidly becoming a favorite
expression of a majority if the citizens
of Hendersonville; Many plans by
which it can be accomplished are be
ing expressed by those directly inter
ested. If there 13 anything in that old
expression ' where there is a will,
there is a way" then Hendersonville is
going to have the latest season in its
history. It is said that quite a num
ber of the present summer visitors Lave
expressed their desire to spend an Oc
tober in Hendersonville. Those who
have tried it say that this month is
the finest of the entire twelve in the
mountains. The golden clad moun
tains and the Indian summer clouds
together with ideal climate is an in
ducement that no other section, except
the mountains can offer, the tourists.
