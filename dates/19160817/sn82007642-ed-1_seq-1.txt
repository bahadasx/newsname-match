fundamental issues may not be
decided in prejudice and igno
rance. "Mr. Wilson's beliefs have boon
expressed in law and in declared
policies. He has made an open
record by which he raay be jud
ged. Wise choice is not possible
unless you yourself make equally
specific statement of purposes
and convictions.
"Without intent to offend, we
feel justified in charging that in
no single public utterance have
you filed a bona fide bill of par-
ticulars nor have you offered a
single constructive suggestion.
"Personalities are without val
ue. Blanket criticism is worth
ess. What we desire to know,
what it is fair that the electoral
should know, are tho exact de
tails of your disagreement with
President Wilson. What has he
done that you would not have
done, and what has he failed to
do that you would have done or
will do? Honesty and patriotism
demand that you should put
yourself upon record in such
manner as to permit people to
judge you as they are now able
to judge President Wilson. Tor
example:
"Would you have filed instant
protest against the invasion of
Belgium and backed up that pro
test with the United States na
vy? "It is arrant nonsense to talk
about action that would have
prevented the Lusitania tragedy.
The vague advertisementdidnot
appear until shortly before the
hour of sailing. Tho occurrence
was one of those things that civ
ilization has made the world re
gard as incredible. The only
honest question is this: Would
von harp mnrlA tho flisfiKtpr flip
subject of diplomatic negotia
tions or would you have broken
relations with Germany at once?
"Would you have urced upon
Congress an embargo upon the
shipment of munitions to the Al
lies? "Would you urge universal
compulsory military service?
"You are frank in stating that
Huert'a's morals were of no con
cern to America. Does this mean
that you would have recognized
Huerta?
"As matters stand today would
you be in favor of intervening in
Mexico?
'Does your attack upon the
Wilson Shipping Bill mean that
you are in favor of ship subsides?
"You speak enthusiastically of
the rights of the worker. Does
k Tins impjy maii you indorse me
h Clayton Anti-Trust Law and the
V Seamen's Bill? or will you urge
their repeal?
"What are your specific com
plaints against tho Federal Re
serve Law?
"As Governor of New York you
opposed the income tax amend
ment. Does this antagonism
persist? Do you or do you not
believe in paying for prepared
ness out of the tax on incomes,
inheritances and munitions?

Boys a Lot of Islands.
Washington Disuatoh.4th.
Purchase by the United States
of the islands of St. Thomas, St.
Croix and St. John, lying to the
east of Porto Rico and compris
ing an archipelago known as the
Danish West Indies, is provided
for in a treaty Bigned by theUni-
ted States and Denmark. It will
be submitted at once to the Uni
ted Statss Senate and theDuuish
Parliament, whose ratifications
are necessary to complete the
purchase agreement.
No serious opposition is expec
ted in the Senate, where action
will be sought at the present ses
sion. Members of the foreign re
lations committee are under
stood to be virtually unanimous
in their approval of the treaty.
Senator Lodge, the rankina: Re
publican member, issued a state
ment tonight declaring the argu
ment in favor of the acquisition
of the islands are unanswerable.
Tho only objection is expected to
come from Senators who believe
the purchase price of $25,000,
000 too great.
The outcome in the Danish
Parliament is more uncertain.
although the expectation here is
that the treaty will be accepted
European powers which have
wanted possession of the islands
tor military reasons are not ex
expecieu to iook with favor on
the proposed sale to the United
States and they may bring strong
pressure to bear at Copenhagen
It is recalled that failure of a sim
ilar purchase treaty in the Dan
ish Parliament years aero was
attributed to German influence.
The signing of the treaty took
place in New York, where Secre
tary Lausiug and Constantin
Isrun, the Danish minister, met
to affix their signatures to the
document. The copy which will
be filed at the State Department
was brought to Washiugton to
night b y Assistaut Solicitor
Woolsey.
Details of the pact will not be
made public until it is transmit
ted to the Senate, at least. It is
understood to provide, however,
for complete acquisition of the
islands, but to stipulate that
Danish business interests there
shall be guaranteed protection.
A clause also is included ceding
to Denmark the undefined Araer
ican rights of discovery in Green
land, a Danish possession.
Senator Lodge emphasized in
a statement tonight the possibil
ity that the islands, if notacquir
ed by the United States, might
fall into the hands of some Eu
ropean power and involve this
government in difficulties under
the Monroe Doctrine "which
might easily lead to war" aeon
sideration which it is understood
has been prominently before the
eyes of officials here in their ne
gotiations for tho purchase.
"The population is only 33,
000, of whom nearly 30,000 are
negroes," said Senator Lodge.
'There is no possibility of any
material increase in population
and annexation would never in
volve at any time the trouble
some question of Statehood.
"The Danish Islands could be
readily defended from attack, oc
cupy a commanding strategic
position aud are of incalculable
value to the united btates.

Issues Scarca.
For practically the first time
in a national political campaign
io may De said that there is no
distinct issue outlined by either
party whereon the judgment o
the voter may be based. The on
ly issue that the Republican par
ty can present is Woodrow Wi
son, who must be defeated at a
costs according to the Republi
can way of thinking. It may be
1 J 1. 1 IT1 II .
saia mat vv lison is much more
of an issue than is Mr. Hughes
for the record of the present ad
ministration will be either endor
sed or condemned at the polls
next November. It may be said.
however, that the former justice
of the Supreme court comes very
near having an issue when bv a
policy of silence he practically ac.
cepts the endorsement of his can
didacy at the hands of the Ger
man and German-American so
cieties. Tho issue, as far as this
phase of the campaign is concer
ned, will revolve around the ques.
uou wueiner or not uerman in
fluences can control the result o
a presidential election in theUni
ted States.
Of course, some effort will be
made by the Republicans to ere
ate an issue out of President Wil
son's Mexican policy, butalways
this attempt will be weakened
by failure of candidate Hughes
and his managers to say what
they would have done under the
circumstances which the presi
dent has encountered since he en
tered the white house. It is wel
enough to dispose of the question
in glittering generalities, but the
American people are going to
ask for a bill of particulars when
the Republican spellbinders set
out to enlarge on Mexico. Then,
too, there are many who. while
still believing that the Mexican
question should have been settled
by force of arms, now realize that
this country was in no condition
to begin hostilities, even when
fucing an admittedly inferior foe.
Ihere is little hone. then, for
Mexico as an issue, and it is gen-
erally admitted that the poor
old tariff can not be dragged out
this year. Republican leaders
have been advised by members
of their own party that there is
nothing whereon Republicans
can base a general attack on the
existing tariff law, and it were
well to let it alone. Business
men the country over have found
the Democratic tariff legislation
to be generally satisfactory, and
there is no marked demand for
its repeal.

The Spirit of Western North Carolina.
Asbeville Citizen.
There is no cross without its
crown, no disaster without a
blessing somewhere in its wake,
and we firmly believe that West
ern North Carolina the tourist
section of the State will reap
great benefits from its n cent vis
itations. Such has been the expe
rience of many cities in the Uni
ted States where catastrophes
of every description have been
followed by unprecedented pros
perity. And why? Because a new
spirit of solf-help was born in ev
ery instance.
The Citizen would not seek to
minimize, nor underestimate the
misfortune that havo come to
many of our people, butyet it be
lieves that the people of Western
North Carolina have much to be
thankful for. The damage done
by the recent storm was not so
greatthatitcannotbe repaired,
and even lay the foundation for
greater fortune. We have many
things that the storm and flood
'cannot affect our spirit of con
fidence and determination, the
spirit of Western North Curoli-
na.
The Almighty and nature have
given to this section three sourc
es from which it mav crow to
greater dimensions, to greater
prosperity, to greater usefulness
to all humanity. From these for-
st-clad ramparts of the world
may be drawn health, real hap
piness, the joy of contemplating
the beautiful, an inspiration to
do the best work that is in man
or woman. "From tho hills com-
eth our strength," aud we be
lieve that this little bit of Heav
en was placed here for nil man
kind. From the forests them
selves, and from the untransmu-
ted gold beneath their floors, is
now pounn- into this section a
material prosperity which must
coutinuo to increase in value and
worth.
Supplementing all these natu
ral sources of greatness is that
almost undelinable thing named
"public spirit." The spirit of Wes
tern North Carolina has been
manifested so often that to enu
merate tho instances hero might
be tiresome. Possibly the recent
storm, however, called forth the
finest manifestation of that spir
it, without which the vast poten-
tial wealth bestowed upon this
section wou'd be quite without
value. .

Horn to Get Money Under tho Rural
Credits Law.
Stateeville Landmark.
Tho Landmark has printed
from time to ti mo considerable
information about tho rural
credits bill, which recently pass
ed Congress and is now a law.
The Monroe J curnal has put in
a few paragraphs, in understan
dable form, the main features of
the law, which arc reproduced as
further information:
1. Ten or more farmers await
ing loans must organize an asso
ciation. 2. No man can get a loan for
more than $10,000 or less than
f 100, or for less than five or
more than 40 years.
3. Borrowers must be, ora-
bout to become, the owner of
the land offered as security, and
engaged, or about to become en
gaged, in its cultivation.
4. JJorrowers to use money
for. the following purposes and
none other: (a) To purchase land
for agricultural uses; (b) to pur
chase equipment, fertilizers and
livo stock necessary for the prop
erand reasonable operation o
the mortgaged farm; (c) to pro
vide buildings and improve the
mortgage lands; (d) to liquidate
the indebtedness of the owner
, A board of five directors
must be elected by the members
of the association, and these
directors must elect a president,
vice presideut, secretary, treasu
rer, and a loan committee of 3
members.
G. The loan committee mstap.
praise the lands of all members
aud the reports of these apprais
ers, together with other necessa
ry information, must be forwar
ded to the secretary to tho dis
trict Federal land bank.
7. If tho district land bank
and the Inderal larm Loan
Board, upon examination, find
that all requirements have been
complied with a charter will be
issued and the loans granted.
1 here is. another very impor
tant provision, whijh is that in
case a man wants to borrow and
is pliable to secure the co-opera
tion of tho nine neighbors neces-
ry to form a local association, he
may borrow direct that is. if
the general farm loan bank has
appointed an agent within h i s
reach. This agent may be a local
bank or trust company which
secures the money from the cen
tral farm loan bansj for the cus
tomer and becomes responsible
to it for the debt, which is regula
ted as in the case where the far
mer has secured a local associa
tion.
