The bridge on the Chicago & Alton
line between Bowling Green and Lou
isiana was washed out Monday night
None
of the Chicago and Alton trains had
been able to run on schedule up to ten
o'clock Tuesday on accout of the
washout. The trains were sent via
Hannibal and the short line in order
to reach Mexico.
Officials at the Chicago and Alton
depot say it will be sometime before
the damage can be repaired and traf
fic resumed over the line, and that In
the meantime the trains will be sent
here over the Wabash.
In normal times there is very lit
tle water in the creek over which the
bridge passes, but after a heavy rain
the water rises rapidly. The heavy
rains of the past few days overflowed
the banks of the creek and washed a
way the bridge.
The John Robinson ShowB, the cir
cus which showed in Vandalia Mon
day, is tied up there by the washout,
railroad officials say. They are una
ble to state just how long they will
be there, but it is thought they will re
main for sometime. The circus trav
eled in a special train of twenty-eight
cars.
4.98 inches of rain fell in Mexico in
the past week. A heavy rainfall was
general all over the county, causing a
rapid rise of the creeks and streams.

In the fifteen days since the first of
August the price of flour in this city
has gone from $7 to $8 a barrel.
This rise of a dollar in little over ten
days is almost unprecedented in the
history of the milling business in
this community. In Kirksvllle the
prices increased $1.24 and in other
parts of the State there were similar
increases.
Wheat is bringing close to $1.60 a
bushel and as a consequence the flour
has to follow the market, no matter
where the market goes. The millers
who have been caught by having
some high-priced wheat on hand and
been forced to lower the price on their
flour, have decided it best to keep
close to the market on the price of
Hour.
The bakers are especially feeling
this increase in the price of flour.
While no move has been made to in
crease the cost per loaf in this city
or to decrease the size of the loaf, it
is quite likely that some move along
this line will develop before the month
ends. The Mexico bakers are doing
all they can to maintain their loaves
at the same price and size. In Kirks.
ville some of the bakers have discon
tinued the manufacture of five-cent
loaves almost entirely and now sell
10-cent loaves to the greater part of
their trade. The housewives find
that flour by he sack has increased in
price from 16c to 80c a sack. '
DRINK MASTERED A PASTOR
Rev. Williamson, Formerly of Kansas
City, Victim, of AlcohoL
Have You Trouble
With Your Feet?
Mason
ST. LOUIS, Mo., August 11. The
Rev. Dr. William Williamson, former
pastor of the Third Baptist Church
here, known as "the frendliest man
in St Louis," in an interview given
to reporters yesterday morning said
his recent breakdown was due to
drink. He left St. Louis for Kansas
City, where he formerly had a pastor
ate, on his way to Denver. After a
month's visit ' n"e "win"'reTurir to 'SE
Louis and begin anew his career as
clergyman.
Dr. Williamson's collapse six
months ago was one of the most dis
cussed topics in church circles in St.
Louis. His intimate friends were
aware that his breakdown was tne
result of drink, and it was discussed
to some, extent in various churcn
gatherings. The pastor was taken
from St. Louis and was kept at va
rious institutions in the hope that
he would recover and could again take
up his work at the church. Later the
church voted to accept his resigna
tion.
Gave Out a Statement '
A signed statement given out by
Doctor Williamson, in which no
blames drink for his present condi
tion, follows:
For fifteen years I labored
amongst you as pastor of one of the
churches of St. Louis. Most of those
years were spent night and ' day
among all sorts of conditions of men
who had no claim upon me as pastor.
No pastor was ever more rewarded
in precious friendships than I. , Few
pastors have touched as many Bides
of life. The call on my time, my
energy and my physical, intellectual
and spiritual resources was enor
mous. For years I went at such- a
pace that a taxicab could scarcely
follow.
HadNothing to Meet the Crisis.
"Giving my life, inch by inch, for
others, little did I think I was leav
ing myself resourceless when a moral
crisis came into my life. That crisis
came, and for months I was a wreck
ed man. " The habit of drink fastened
itself upon me, and before I knew it
alcohol had conquered me."
