off will be Necessary.
Complete unofficial returns from
the Democratic primary held Tues
day to nominate congressmen and
supreme court judges show that in
the congressional race Hon. E. S.
Candler defeated his opponent, Hon.
J. R. Rankin, by a safe majority,
while Hon. E. 0. Sykes led in the
race for supreme court justice, with
Hon. R. H. Knox second and Hon.
J. G. McGowen third. Judge Sykes
has a lead of from one to two thous
and votes over Mr. Knox, and a sec
ond contest will be necessary to de
termine the final result.

nine of the thirty-one counties in
the district gave the results of the
race for justice of the supreme
court to be as follows: Sykes, 9,967;
Knox, 7,551; McGowen, 3,561.
Mr. Candler is the present repre
sentative of the First Congressional
district and Judge Sykes now repre
sents the Third district on the su
preme court bench. Both these dis
tricts include Lowndes county.
In this county Mr. Candler and
Judge Sykes the favorites, the
former havi.. received 604 votes
. out of a total of 772, while the lat
ter had a plurality of 197 votes over
his two opponents.
The Memphis Commercial-Appeal
estimates Mr. Candler s vote at
,417 and that of Mr. Rankin at 4,
189, giving the foimer majority of
1,229.
The contest incited but little in
terest, the vote not only in Lowndes
county but throughout the state hav
ing been not more than 50 per cent
of normal.
The . unofficial results in Lowndes
county follows:

In the fourth district returns show
a good lead for the present encum
bent, Congressman T. U. Sisson, over
his two opponents, W. C. Ward of
Montgomery ' county and C. E
.Franklin of Pontotoc without a run
ff. Later returns may make a run-
toff necessary, however, with Ward
probably being eliminated.
J. W. Collier s renomination in
Ithe Eighth district over J. W. Howie
seems assured. Collier carried his
own county, Warren , by almost
1,500 votes, which gave him such a
lead that despite the loyal support
given the Hinds county man Col

TALKS SERVE TO
RESTORE HARMONY
Members of Board of Revenue
Agree to Abide by Commit
tee's Decision.
A meeting of vital importance to
the Jackson Highway was held at
Vernon, Ala., Monday, its purpose
having been to settle a dispute
among citizens of Lamar county, of
which Vernon is the county seat, re
garding the route of the proposed
thoroughfare through that county.
The meeting was presided over by
Hon. J. T. Millner, of Vernon, and
was largely attended, it being esti
mated that there were fully 750
people present. Hon. R. T. Simpson,
of Florence, Ala., president of the
Jackson Military Highway Associa
tion, was the principal speaker, and
addresses were also delivered by
Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., local member
of the executive committee; J. G.
Weatherly, secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce; Hon. W. P. Stribling,
senator from Lowndes county
Judge Richard Bradley, a prominent
Lamar county politician, Hon. Wal
ter Neesmith, a well known attorney
of Vernon, and others.
At the suggestion of Mr. Weath
ly it was agreed to appoint a com
mittee to go over the two proposed
routes and decide as to which one is
the most feasible. Members of this
committee are to be men who do not
reside op either one of the proposed
routes and whose decision therefore
will be unbiased and unprejudiced.
A1J of Hi!! ".vnt nhfrjtcf. ,th$ !!;?, of
revenue of Lamar county were pres-
nt and each of them agreed
to abide by the decision of the com-
y Mr. Milner, who presided over the
meeting.
The meeting was characterized by
perfect harmony, and the people of
Lamar county seemed to be entirely
willing to lay aside personal desires
and ambitions in order to bring
about results which will be for the
public good and which will result in
the speedy construction of the high
way. Columbians in attendance take
very optimistic view of the situa
tion, and believe that a route accept
able to all will be speedily agreed
upon and that construction of the
highway through Lamar county will
be resumed at an early date.
CITY COUNCIL DECIDES TO
EXTEND RAILWAY FRANCHISE
MEMPHIS, COLUMBUS AND PEN-
SACOLA GIVEN ONE YEAR
LONGER.
At a special meeting held Wed
nesday afternoon the local munici
pal council decided to extend for
a period of one year the franchise
of the Memphis, Columbus and Pen-
sacola railroad. The franchise,
which was originally granted several
years ago, was about to expire, and
its extension was requested by Mr.
G. T. Heard, president of the com
pany. There was some opposition to
granting the proposed extension,
and petitions asking the council to
deny the request were circulated.
They were not liberally Bigned,
however, and the municipal solons,
upon motion of Councilman Harris,
voted to extend the franchise as
requested.
Five of the six members of the
board were present, and only one
vote was recorded against the ex
tension of the franchise.
A local committee consisting 0f
t wr t i nf v i.f
terson, H. J. Brewster, Annie
Brooks and John R. Laws has been
appointed to solicit donations to
the fund which the Anti-Saloon
League is raising to prevent a ref

shipments of liquor to persons re
siding within the borders of the
state. .

Mrs. F.mm Dowdle. 35. was al

fully bruised on the forehead, in a
horrible accident which occurred at
lieersheba crossing on the Mobile &
Ohio Railroad about eight miles east
of Columbus at 10:20 o'clock Sun-
lay morning, when a buirvrv in which
they were riding was struck by pas
senger tram No. 106, due here at
10:30.
The railroad crossing where the
accident occurred is on a hiirh trad-
inu and only a short distance from
a curve, and neither Mr. Dowdle or
his wife knew that the train was ap
proaching. Mrs. Dowdle realizing
that her life was in danger, leaped
from the buKiry and fell beneath the
engine. Both of her legs were sever
ed and practirully every bone in her
body was crushed. Her husband re
mained in the carriage, which was
thrown off the track. Besides several
bruises, he received two cut places
on his face.
Mr. and Mrs. Dowdle were
en route to Beersheba church to at
tend services, and upon leaving
home took with them their three
children, one son,' Leighton. and
two daughters, Lorraine and La

to IWrsheba cemetery where the
funeral took place.

CONFERENCE AT WHITE
HOUSE FAILS TO RESULT
IN SETTLEMENT.
SOMK PKOORKSS
IS MADE HOWEVER
Magnate May Concede Eight
Hour Day, which will Great
ly Simplify Matters.
Washington, August 11 Presi
dent Wilson's efforts to bring the
railroad managers and the brother
hood leaders UKther in some form
of tettlement of the differences
which threaten a nation-wide stre
Las, after two days' conferences,
piogressed only to the point where a
giourdwork for further negotiacior-s
has been laid.
Hope of arbitration of all issues
waned yesterday but the situatioa
was brightened by the possibility of
a settlement beinir reached bv the
railroads conceding the principle of
the eight-hour day and both sides
settling collateral issues by some
form of negotiatioa as yet undeterm
ined.
After communicating with Pres
ident Wilson the employes' sub-com
mittee sent word to New York for
tiie 640 members of the general as
sembly to come to Washington in
order to facilitate negotiations.
They are expected here Thursday
and will probably see the President
Friday. The managers committee will
nlso confer with him again.
Two official statements issued
from the White House during the
day merely stated that the dbtcus
sions still were in progress and that
nc report could be made on result.
The first statement, issued - by
rUry Totally, after the Pre
ident had , met the railroad mana
gers during the forenoon, follows:
"The President spent an hour
and a half this morning with the
representatives of the railway man
agement. After the conference he
said it was impossible as yet to re
port on the results, all that he could
say was that a very candid and hon
est discussion in progress about
a practical basis of settlement."
Latrr in the day, after the Pres
ident's meeting with the represen
tatives of the men, he made this
statement;
"There Is no change. There is an
earnest effort bekig made to work
out a settlement."
When it became clear that arbi
tration of the entire problem preba
bly never would be agreed to, but
the railroads might concede the
principal of the eight-hour day and
dispose of other issues by some
form of negotiation, the President
directed his energies to obtaining
expressions from both sides on how
negotiations could be carried on.
Direct conferences and inquiry by
at) investigating committee were
suggested and the President indicat
ed his willingness to appoint such a
commission himself.
It was understood that the
plpyes' representatives offered
suggestions on this feature of
situation. The railroads were
ported to be ready to concede
em
no the
principle of the eight-hour day on
condition that all collateral issues be
thoroughly investigated by the in
terstate commerce commission or
some other body.
