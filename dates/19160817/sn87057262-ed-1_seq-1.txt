Appeal.

Means.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 17.—The'first
of the 640 members of tbe railroad
brotherhoods' general committee be
tas filing into the east entrance of the
white house at 2:45 this afternoon.
A large crowd witnessed their arrlyal.
Although A. B. Qarretson, of the
gttb-commlttee had a copy of the presi
dent's proposal—ten lines in length—
written on white house stationery by
the president himself-—none of the
general committee had read it. Lee,
Carter and Stone of the sub-commit'
tee had- duplicates. It was not dis
cussed,. it was declared, at the meet
ing of the general committee at the
Bijou theatre which lasted from one
o'clock until
two.
"The president himself Is
to
it,"
The expression "ultimate authority"
was used by Chambers. Exactly what
the president has in mind is not
known, but it was thought possible
that he may appeal over the heads of
the railway presidents to the -stock
holders themselves, or aSk a new ref
erendum vote by the employes on the
proposals he has' made for a settle
ment.
Immediately folowlng his conference
with Judge Chambers the president
returned to bis library to complete
the proposals he Is to make to the
640 representatives of the railway
brotherhoods when they gather in tho
historic east room of the white house
this afternoon.

CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 17.—Western
railroad heads invited to a confer
ence with President Wilson at Wash
ington were out of town today with
the exception of E. P. Ripley, presi
dent of the Santa Fe. Ripley said he
had not made up his mind as to
whether he would accept the invita
tion. A. J. Earling. of the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul, was reported
In California and R. H. Aishton of
the Chicago and Northwestern, and
Samuel Pulton, of the Chiqyso Great
Western, were "out of town." John
M. Glenn, publisher of the Manufac
turers News, today directed an ap
peal to manufacturers to send a mes
sage to President Wilson upholding
the attitude of the railroads.
"The unions took advantage of the
situation existing at the time of the
breaking out of the European war
and were given concessions and they
now take advantage of the peculiar
conditions which our country fiaces.
"Right must be maintained. The is
sue is a principle. It may cost some
thing to enforce it but it must be en
forced sooner or later," the appeal
reads.

the Russian and Italian offensives
temporarily, though the great battle
of the Somme continues to progress
favorably for the allies.
For the first time in more than a

no further gains. Petrograd dis

enemy counter attacks have checked

HOW DID IT LEAK OUT?
The Suggestion Regarding German
Surveillance, Was In Confl
j, id^ntial Communication
to State Department.
BEiRLiN, Aug. 17.—A vigorous at
tack on Ambassador Gerard was
made today by the Berlin Morgenpost
and the Cologne Gazette, two influ
tial German newspapers, for the atti
tude toward the German censorship
he is alleged to have displayed in a
confidential communication to the
state department.
American correspondents In Berlin
recently handed to the ambassador a
protest against British censorship of
cable dispatches and mail matter
they had sent to the United States.
They pointed out that British censors
badly ^mutilated many of their dis
patches and that a large percentage
of their mail stories failed to reach
America at all.
In transmitting the report to the
state department. Ambassador Ger
ard is reported to have sent along a
confidential note recommending that
no action be taken .by the American
government unless Germany removed
the censorship on news sent to
America. How this alleged confi
dential note became public property
i3 not known but the contents of the
message soon became known In
newspaper circles.
"The American government and its
organs already have endured many
brutal English infringements," said
the Morgenpost, even Americans re
proach their officials. They have de
graded themselves by giving up their
neutrality and 'honor as accomplices
of England, eo it is presumable that
they will also endure this infringe
ment and the attitude of their am
bassador whereby the British in
fringement is supported.
'We doaibt whether the German
foreign office will be satisfied with
Gerard's conduct. We hope the gov
ernment will find means to correct
this strange attitude. The German
censorship does not concern him and
he has no right to criticize measures
necessary for the safety of German
interests."
The Cologne Gazette editorial was
in similar vein.

RAIL LINES TO DEPOT
Veritable Network of These Carry
Supplies and Munitions to
Put Punch Into
Blows.
[By Henry Wood, United Press Staff
Corresponflent.]
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY ON
THE SOMME, Aug. 17—Like a
gigantic multiplied sledge-hammer,
the French army is smashing away
at the German lines on the Somme
battle front. The new French offen
sive in no way resembles the Rus
sian steam roller. Instead it hammers
continually with blow upon blow at
any given point until eventually the
French officers believe, it must break
down both the German defenses and
the resistance of the German army.
The success of this steady hammer
ing. is demonstrated both by the actual
advance, and the influx cf prisoners
who have surrendered in large num
bers.
Berore going to tho nghting rront
I inspected the vast organization he
hind the lines for feeJ'ng the offen
sive. It is this incredible preparation
on which apparently everything has
been forseen and nothing overlooked
that puts the punch into the French
sledge hammer blows.
I first visited one of the eight muni
tions and material depoto established
last May, miles behind the line. The
depot covers a square half mile into
which France's northwestern network
of railways daily pours material com
ing from all parts of the world. If
the French offensive has carried ter
rible destruction in advance of the
armies, it has wrought equally incred
ible progress in the rear. The eight
munition depots have been connected
with the battle front by a veritable
mystic maze of railways of both
broad and narrow gauge. In peace
times it would have required a year's
work to construct them. Approach
ing the battle front these lines con
verge even thicker and even more in
tricately. So perfected is this rail
way system that each of the eight
depots can pour out upon the Somme
battle front its entire square half
mile of munitions and material every
thirty-six hours.
Carry Guns by Trains.
On other specially constructed rail
ways, all of broad gauge, guns are
being carried to the front. France
does not lack neavy artilerly on the
Somme front, but is making constant
additions for the purpose of increas
lng the power of her punch.
From the depot, the way led to one
of the four aviation camps which pro
tected every depot, but which are
only a small part of the aviation ser
vice on the Somme front. During the
visit scarcely a minute passed that
armed aeroplanes either did not re
turn or depart for the German front.

and is Spending iit With
Thrillers, His Manager
Has Procured.
FEW SPEECHES TODAY
Candidate Hits Philippine Situation
in His Appearance at
Portland Last
Night.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
ROSEBITHG, Ore„ Aug. 17.
Charles E. Hughes, republican presi
dential candidate, today took the
toiggest "jump" in his transcontinent
al trip. He was enroute from Port
land to San Francisco with only one
stop of more than a few minutes
scheduled for the day at Shasta
Springs tonight. Three or four
points were scheduled to hear the
candidate for a bare three or four
minutes but no formal speeches had
been arranged, not even at Shasta
Springs.
A day of almost solid ooanfort was
in prospect for Hughes. Solid com
fort, be it known in the governor's
opinion, consists in a place to
stretch out and time in which to rest
his mind by reading horrendous,
hair raising detective stories, dime
novels, to be exact. It is only a
trifle less restful to read heavy
historical essays.
Carl D. Shepherd", Hughes' person
al representative, went out In Port
land last night and raided the news
stands for sufficiently" thrilling liter
ature, accumulating one of the larg
est libraries of lurid detective nar
ratives ever assembled. But stuck
away in this pile of paper 'bound
volumes was a copy of "The Rdse
and Fall of the Roman Empire," from
the Hughes library.
In his speech tit the Ice Rink in
Portland last night, the candidate
delivered another broadside at the
democratic policies, concentrating his
fire particularly on the Philippine
'situation. He declared the United
States undertook to govern the is
lands properly and that "we assum
ed obligations there which we are
'bound to' discharge."
"We ought not to consider the
suggestion of scuttling out of the
Philippines," he said, "to leave them
in the predicament which you know
perfectly well without my describing
it."
'Hughes made a pronouncement on
the tariff and attacked the adminis
tration's attitde, asserting that tbe
democratic party has opposed reg.1
progress. He said:
"If I were a member of that party
and looked through the platforms of
the past I should feel that I was
going through a cemetery richly em
bellished with monuments."
He declared that he wanted to see
the "empire of Alaska'' developed
right.
"If I am charged with the high of
fice for which I am a candidate," he
concluded, "to put irfy principles to
the test, I am not afraid of that test.
I have no ambition to hold high of
fice, but I have an ambition to try,
so far as it lies within me, to have
efficient American government."

[By Robert J. Bender, United Press

WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 —Reaching
what apparently was a deadlock in
the attempted settlement of the
threatened strike on the railroads.
President Wilson today eent a tele
gram to the presidents of the great
railway systems of the country, ask
ing that they come to Washington at
onoe for a conference.
The telegram says:
"Discussion of the matters involved
In the threatened railroad strike has
reached a point which makes it highly
desirable that I should personally,
confer with you at the earliest pos
sible, moment,and with the president,
of any other of the railways affected
who may be immediately accessible.
Hope you can make it convenient to
come to Washington."
Before sending the telegram the
president talked with President Wil
lard of the Baltimore and Ohio, by
long distance telephone and was as
sured by Willard that the railroad
heads would come to Washington im
mediately.
The president's action resulted from
the attitude taken by the railroad
managers in a statement left at the
white house last night by Eltsha Lee.
chairman of their committee. In this|
they strongly indicated they wouldj
not concede the eight hour principle,
even for the proposed trial period and
that the strongest concession they]
would make would be to submit the*
whole matter to arbitration, the presi
dent to name the arbitrators.
Claim There Is PolKlcs.
Today the managers showed no dis
position to recede from this position.,
Several of them declared they saw
politics in the president's efforts*
since accepting this plan would meanj
putting the whole matter over until
after the elections. The commission
could not accomplish anything tan
gible before next spring, they said.
X*
a,
The managers apparently are un
moved by arguments of the president
that his proposal would result in a
system that would probably enable!
them *to avoid sudden strikes in the1
future.
Three ballots have been taken in
the past two days, it was said today,
and each time the managers have
voted down the president's proposal.
