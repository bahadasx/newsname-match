The month of July was rather a
warm month in the Estancia valley.
There were two warm periods, the 1st,
2nd, IJrd, 4th and 5th, and the 20th, 21st,
22nd and 2lrd, when the temperature
went to 00 or above; the highest was 94
on the 2nd. The lowest night tem
perature was 42. There was rain at
Kstancia on the Gih, 7i h. 10th, 11th,

A daughter of Mr. Barron living
west of Estancia near the mountains
met with a serious accident Tuesday
evening. She was in a wagon going

sharp turn to entera gatu Approach
ing the turn the team broke into a trot
Hiidatlhe turn she was thrown out
and the v-agon wheel passed over her
breast. She seemed to be severely in
jured, and a doctor was summoned. At
last report she was getting along well,
and it was hoped the would soon re
cover. Here is something for the weather
sharps to talk about: 'lhe theory has
been propounded here that the creation
of the Elephant llutte reservoir would
increase the rainfall in the Estancia
valley, because during the months of
greatest evaporation the wind are al
most continuously from the southwest
and would carry the moisture taken up
from the reservoir surface over this
valley, and in passing through th! cool
air above the mountains ic should form
clouds and under proper conditions pre
cipitate in the valley, According to
statements heretofore printed in re
gard to the extent of the reservoir, the
surface should be near one hundred
minare miles. According to i.h gov

The hearing on the motion to oust
Receiver Ely of the N. M. C. is pro
ceeding in Santa Fe. An interesting
story in connection with the applica
tion for authority to dismantle the
road "m whole or in part" is that the
Santa Fe has made a reasonable oiler
to purchase the road provided per
mission is given to tear it up between
wiuaru ana Torrance anu between
Kennedy and Santa Fe, the remainder
to be operatod between Santa Fe and

A couple of weeks ago the report
was circulated here that an attempt
nau neen maae to ourn the olllce of
the Willard Record. The Record did
not mention it. Yesterday in re
sponse to a question the publisher,
Mr. Hitt, confirmed the report, but
said it was not mentioned in the pa
per for the reason that he thought it
uiu not uo tne town any good for it to
be known that such things occur there.
Of course it is bad that such things
can happen in any town, but it is a
mistake to attempt to suppress news
of it, because it can't be done. The
report travels by word of mouth
and doesn't lose anything on the
road. The facts as stated by Mr.
Hitt are that coal oil was poured on
the litter of naners and letters on the
uesk anu set on lire. The papers and
oil burned up, but the desk being of
nara wood, lulled to burn. The back
door was found standing open the
next morning, the printer having
failed to lock it when he left the office
on the previous evening.

at the dam during June was slightly
nlmve one and one fourth feet. This
amount of water lifted from a surface
of one hundred square miles is some
water, but there is some country east
and northeast of the reservoir, h'or
example, Torrance county alone is
more than thirty times the area of the
reservoir. And there are many other
factors entering into a problem of this
kind, making it a complex one. And
as for the month of June, the rainfall
in the Estancia valley was not in
creased, because there wasn't any.
Mrs. Guttcrman, who had levn
visiting her son. Charley Gutternian,
returned this morning to her home in

Each Precinct is entitled to

is entitled to at least one del e-

J. N. Burton, Chairman.
Ralph G. Roberson, Secretary,
Estancia, Aug. 12, 1916.
The Republican convention held
here yesterday was quite an interest
ing affair for those on the inside,
The outsider could see plainly that
something was popping, but he didn't
know just what it was.
The clans began gathering on Tues
day. There were visiting statesmen
from Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las
Vegas, including Secundino Romero,
candidate for governor, Frank Hub-
bell, candidato for senator, Attorney
Wood of Albuquerque, Jose Ortiz y
Pino of Santa Fe, and many lesser
lights. District Attorney Hamilton
was here also, trying to bolster up
tne wobbly places in his fences.
. There were contesting delegations
from Manzano, one headed by Candido
rauuia and the other chosen fruin the
opposing faction.
lhe convention was called to order
in the forenoon and immediately ad.
journed to three o'clock in the after
noon, to enable the managers to iron
out the wrinkles. The ironing process
required so much time that the con
vention did not reassemble until a few
minutes before four o'clock.
The convention was called to order
by Candido Padilla, county chairman.
Cristino Chavez and Federico Cha
vez were elected temporary chairman
and secretary respectively, and these
officers were later made permanent,
E. D. Amnio acted as interpreter.
A motion that the chairman appoint
the usual committees, made by Can-
dido Padilla, prevailed.
The chairman asked to have the
delegates pass in review before Win
in order that be might know who they
were, and thus be enabled to select
members of the committees. Most of
the delegates complied with the re
quest. A recess was then taken, and upon
reassembling the temporary organiza
tion was made permanent. The con
vention then listened to speeches by
Secundino Romero and Mr. Wood.
The Manzano contest was settled by
seating three delegates from each
delegation.
A motion was mado to adjourn until
eight o'clock, which precipitated con
siderable turmoil, some delegates op
posing the motion very strenuously,
but the motion prevailed.
At the evening session the Romero
program was put through and the Ro
mero slate of delegates elected.
Resolutions instructing the delegates
for Romero for governor and for
Frank Hubbell for senator were
passed. The instructions for Hubbell
are said to have been in the nature of
a compromise to placate the Bursum
Hubbell men, of whom there was a
respectable minority enough to kick
up considerable dust, although the
Romero men were in firm control.
The delegates are Federico Chavez,
Perfecto Jaramillo, Jo Davis, Ray
mundo Romero, Max Zamora, Nico
las Tenorio, Julian Sanchez, Gil
Perea, J. N. Bush.
The matter of Mr. Hamilton's for
tunes was left for future considera
tion, and it is understood that so far
as the Torrance county delegation is
concerned, his fate will depend very
largely on what his opponent, Mr.
Mechem, has done or will do to or
for Mr. Romero.
The Estancia schools will open
September 11th. The board have
decided to let the contract for
the new school building to be
erected immediately after the
close of school next spring. It is
believed that this plan will be
better than to build this fall and
winter, particularly as the latter
plan would involve renting rooms
for school purposes -probably
during the greater part of the
term. Under the course decided
upon the contractor may get ma
terials on the ground and do a
great deal of work before begin
ning actual building.
Here is something new. E. C.
Halderman of Palma has seeded
ten acres to timothy. He says
he has a fine stand. We hope
there will be plenty of rain to
give his crop a good start. The
road is so long that Mr. HaluVr
man does not often come to Es
tancia, but he has promised to
let us know the result of his ex
periment, which will be awaited
with much interest.
