Arthur J. -Meyer, secretary of the
agricultural extension division of the
Fnhcrsity. and W. II. Hargrove will
go to Scdalia tomorrow to look over
the University Iluilding at the State
11 j Fair for the purpose of mapping out

Councilman Whose Engagement Is Announced
and planning the exhibit and demon-'
stration work at the fair. September
23 to 30.
The tentative plans provide that the;
agricultural extension service will
use half of the University Building,
conic to Washington for a conference J. Mr. .Meyer said this morning. The
at once.
The telegram says:
"Discussion of the matters involved
In the threatened railway strike has
reached a point which makes it high
ly desirable that I should personally
confer with you at the earliest possi
ble moment and with the presidents
of any of the other railroads affected
who may be immediately accessible. I
trust you can make it convenient to
come to Washington at once."
Before sending the telegram the
President talked with President Wil
Iard of the Baltimore and Ohio Kail
road by long distance telephone and
was assured by Willard that the
railroad heads would come to Wash
ington immediately.
.Managers Don't Want Trj-Out.
The President's action resulted from
the attitude taken by the railroad
managers in a statement left at the
White House last night by Elisha
Lee, chairman of their committee. In
this they strongly indicated they
would not concede the 8-hour prin
ciple, even for the proposed trial pe
riod, and that the greatest conces
sion they would make would lie to
submit the whole matter to arbitra
tion, the President to name arbitra
tors. Today the managers showed no dis
position to recede from this position.
Several of them declared that they
saw politics in the President's effort,
since accepting this plan would
mean putting the whole matter over
until after the election. The commis
sion could not accomplish anything
tangible before next spring, they said.
The managers apparently are un
moved by the President's claim that
his proposal would result in a system
d-'tails of the arrangement of the ex
hibit are being left to .Mr. Hargrove.
The agricultural extension division '
is planning to install a permanent

The Columbia police force has
started a campaign to rid the city
of unnecessary noises from automo
biles, and speeding through the busi
ness section of the city.
Several complaints were made at
the last meeting of the City Council
in regard to persons running their
machines with the cut-outs open at
all times of night. .Mayor Batterton,
in calling attention to the fact that
Columbia has an ordinance prohibit
ing the running of machines without
the muffler on, today said:
"The city docs not need the money
and the city officials desire to be
friends of every citizen, but the speed
ing and running car3 with the cut
outs open must stop. We have an
ordinance prohibiting it and I intend
to see that the ordinance is enforced.
The penalty for breakers of this ord
inance will be heavy."
Complaints were made against the
Bowser Taxicab Company at the last
meeting of the council. Mr. Bowser
said today:
"I will do everything in my power
to see that my drivers do not violate
the ordinance. There are times, how
ever, when a car breaks down in the
middle of the business section and
it is impossible to prevent some
noise."
Here is a copy of the ordinance on
cut-outs:
S.- 1. That it Oi.ill Im unlawful for
inv per'-iiu to rn.i and o-rate any mo
tor vehicle Hithiii this city without a
muffler on the exhaust.

Harry Jacks Played on Winner

Few Columbians realize that they
have right In their midst a man who
was a member of a team that once
took a series from the St. Louis
Browns the team that is nov; fur
nishing the thrill of the American
League by winning two out of three
games. That man is Harry .Jacks of
the Herald-Statesman Publishing
Company and the team was Fulton.
Back in 1895 the Browns journeyed
to Fulton for a series of practice
games. They got plenty of practice
and went home with only one game
cut of the three to their credit.
One of the features of the series
came when three Fulton players

mored Today.
Columbia must get up at an early
hour, if the unloading of the Robin
son Circu3 is seen. The cars are ex
pected to arrive in this city some
time between 5 and 7 o'clock in the
morning, according to Wabash of
ficials. The circus shows at Moberly
today, and there is little chance that
the arrival will be late.
The rumor heard over the city to
day to the effect that the show was
marooned by a washout is unfounded.
The Wabash Railroad is clearing the
tracks today, and everything will be
ready when the first train comes into
the yards.
The circus will show at the Fair
Grounds, and not on West Broadway,
as was reported earlier in the week.
JAPAX PLAXS TO IMPROVE XAYY
Expense Said to Amount to 300,IMI0,-

Ily Uulted Press.
TOKIO, Aug. 17. Japan plans to
improve her navy as fast or faster
than the t'nited States. At least, that
is the deduction made by the Japanese
people from the just-announced plan
to spend 23 1,000,000 to 300,000,000 yen
building new battlers in the next sev
en years.
Exactly what the plan under con
sideration by tho Finance Department
of the government is, nobody knows;
but according to the paper Jiji. the
outlay for "the ideal fleet" calls for
about $130,000,000. Other papers' es
timates are a bit lower.
A hot debate on the program is ex
pected at the forthcoming session of
the Diet because of the expense in
volved. The program is backed by
navy leaders and also, it is said, by
the ministers of marine and finance.

"The new Hall Theater will open
Sun sets. August 28.' said O. II. Wilson, who

tlie theater, at the Commercial Club
Luncheon at Harris' today.
, "We will open with one of tlie best
shows that Columbia has ever had,
and show two feature pictures, of live
rfels each, and two of the best acts of
jiudeville that it is possible to Fe
cure. Manager Woods is now in St.
Louis looking after the first shaw. and
we hope to fill the new house, which
will scat 1300 people.
Theater Costs $;3,MK.
'I heard of the action taken hy the
Commercial Club in respect to the
benefit show, and I am proud to live
in such a community," continued Mr.
Wilson. "All the money that has
gone into this new house is foreign
money, and as I have written all the
checks I can say that the building has
cost nearer $63,000 than $30,000, for
what we thought P could be erected
The equipment is the est and has
cost much more than we had planned.
We have tried to put up a sosd house
and it is now up to us to put on the
show."
Frank Conley, the If.rst speaker at
the luncheon brought up the proiosed
benefit, "which -iras -endorsed by-the
club last fall. "It Is only fitting to
recognize such a person who has
brought such a business to this city,"
said Mr. Conley. "We should show
our appreciation cf the new theater
and sell the tickets for the first show.
This is a voluntary movement on the
part of the Commercial Club, and one
that is due, not only to Mr. Hall, but
to any enterprizing citizen."
Others AImi Speak.
J. It. Schwabe, F. W. Neidermcyer,
and Dr. J. B. Cole also siioke, each
endorsing the action of the club, and
praising the new theater.

Wants Pamphlet on Columbia.
Mayor Batterton proposed to the
club that names of citizens whom the
tourist can call and be shown over the
city be posted in Automobile filling
stations. "There are many travelers
coming through Columbia," said Mr.
Batterton, and many go away, not
even knowing that the L'niversity is
here. We should get out a pamphlet
telling about Columbia, and the citi
zens shculd do everything possible
to show the tritsuoctyihite
to show the tourist the city."
The plan was heartily endorsed, and
will be brought up later. At the next
luncheon, representatives of the life
Insurance companies of Columbia will
speak.
