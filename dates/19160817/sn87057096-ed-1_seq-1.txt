CHAUTAUQUA PLEASES
Fine Programs Given Every Day, the
Attendance is Good, and the
Patrons Well Satisfied.
ed last FJ^day evening, and which
will clos^ on Friday evening of this
week, ig being well attended, and the
Midland Chautauqua System has been
•pFoviding a splendid program, and
we have yet-to hear of the first per
son complaining of the talent furnish
ed. The attendancee is much better
than it was hoped for, and has been
increasing daily.. The Midland peo
ple came to Leon with their Chautau
qua without any guarantee whatever,
and considering the short notice the
attendance has been remarkably good
and if they return to Leon next year
it will be much larger.
Rev. Henry Esch, who has been
acting as local manager, has made
good, and has looked after all the
details in a very satisfactory manner.
To his work much of the success of
the Chautauqua must be attributed.
V* The first program was given Friday
evening when Carmeliny's Old Colon-
ial band gave the program, and it is
the biggest little band ever heard in
Leon. The band has only ten pieces,
but every man was an artist, and they
pleased everyone.
Saturday, the musical numbers
we're by Tom Lewis and Prisciila Car
ver. Lewis is a Welsh singer with
a fine voice and his singing was great
ly enjoyed, Miss Carved being a fine
accompanist. The afternoon lecture
was by Morris G. Hindus, a Russian
exile, who spoke on Russia Today,"
and it was one of the best lectures
ever heard in this city, and every
body spoke well of the speaker. The
evening lecture was by Dr. Frank W.
Gunsaulus, the noted divine, his sub
ject being "America of Tomorrow,"
and it was a masterful lecture. "Dr.
Gunsaulus also preached at the Chau
tauqua tent Sunday morning, when a
large congregation heard his eloquent
sermon. The music Sunday after
noon and evening was by James Bu
tin and the McDowell Trio. Mr. Butin
is the finest whistler and bird imita
tor ever heard in this city, his bird
(s-\ imitations being especially fine, and
his whistling with orchestra accom
paniment the best we ever heard. Mr.
Butin is a nephew of Mrs. L. A.
Blackman of Blockley, his home be
ing at Fredonia, Kansas. Rev. E. C.
Newland, the platform manager, gave
an exceptionally fine lecture at the
afternoon session. The evening lec
ture was by that whirlwind Dr. C.
W. Wassam, of the State University,
who made the commencement ad
dress at Leon: this year, his subject
being "The Stuff That Wins." Was
sam can do more talking in a given
length of time than any man we ever
heard, but he is saying something all
the time. He spoke for the future
of our boys and girls.
Monday was the big day, the spec
ial attraction being Helen Keller, and
her teacher, Mrs. Macy, the big tent
being filled to hear her, and many
who were coming*in autos were pre
vented by the muddy roads. Mrs.
Macy told of her work of 29 years
with Helen Keller, and how she had
been able to secure a college educa
tion, and master a number of foreign
languages, although she had been
blind and deaf since ske was 19
months old. She was followed by
Miss Keller, who gave a lecture on
"Preparedness, for Peace." It was a
rare treat to see and hear her. The
DeKoven Male quartet furnished me
music afternoon and evening, and Dr.
LaMont Cole gave an illustrated lec
ture telling of his explorations of the
cliff dwellers in the evening.
Tuesday afternoon Dr. L. G. Her
bert. delivered a splendid lecture "A
Man Among Men," and the Maud
43clieerer's Shakespearian players,
who arrived late, gave some readings.
In the evening they presented "The
Taming of the Shrw, and the big
~Kf* .audience was mighthy pleased. They
are a fine company of artists.
The program for the balance of the
Chautauqua is a splendid one. Yester
*day the music was by the Sibyl Sam
mis-McDermid Company, the after
noon lecture by Senator Elmer J.
Burkett, the Sibyl Sammis-McDermid
&>' Company giving a grand concert in
the evening.
Thursday afternoon Katchel's Met
ropolitan Singers and Miss Helen
Smith in concert, and Ned Woodman,
the humorist. In the evening a grand
concert by the Metropolitans, as vest
ed choir, with Scotch songs by John
Brodie.
Friday, the closing day, there*will
be two concerts, afternoon and even-.
ing by Victor's Florentine Band, the
biggest band on the Chautauqua syg-
tem.
Home From a Long Auto Run.
Prof, and Mrs. I. N. Beard return-,
ed Monday from a five week's auto
outing that took thein as far east as
the Potomac. The greater portion
of the time they spent in company,
with their son Vivian and his wife.1
who reside in Pittsburgh. They to-,
gether made an excursion to Gettys-1
burg, thence down the Potomac to
points near Wasnington. They
traveled (he Lincoln Highway much
of the way east from Tlowa including
the trip over the mountains and they
returned to Pittsburgh over the Na
tional Pike. With the exception of
a few instances they were greatly
impressed with the highway improve
ment that is being made in the sev
eral states through which they trav
eled. They report crop conditions
-generally good. They enjoyed a
month, with their only son and they
returned feeling greatly invigorated
by the delightful outing.—"Osceola

Two Barns Burn.
Two barns were destroyed by fire
which started from lightning during
the thunder showers last Thursday
evening, those of Alonzo Fulton, a
couple of miles south of Leon and
Will Roberts, who lives about three
miles south of Decatur City, both be
ing struck a few minutes before 9
o'clock.
The barn of Mr. Fulton was a new
one, just completed the past year to
replace the barn on the same site
which was struck by lightning and
burned in August, 1914. Mr. and
Mrs. Fulton were at home at the time
and immediately after the flash saw
that the barn was on fire. Mr. Ful
ton pushed a buggy out of the run
way. but that was all he saved from
the barn. Fortunately his live stock
were out in the pasture, but he lost
grain, hay and all his farming tools
and harness. The bam cost him
*$f -r
about
$1,000 and he had insurance of $600.
The barn on the Will Roberts farm
south of Decatur which was burned
about the same time, contained a
quantity of hay, grain ana farming
tools. He had insurance on the barn
of $600, and the loss on the contents
was covered by insurance.
Received Electric Shock.
A young man named Parsons re
ceived a severe electric shock at the
Chautauqua grounds Sunday evening.
It seems that one of the young men
in charge of the tent named Peck,
had connected the wire which holds
up the canvass fence with the electric
light wires, which charged the whole
wire. Parsons was on the north
side, and the rain made the ground
wet and when he Jook hold of the
wire to look over the fence he could
not let go. His cries for help dis
turbed the lecture for a few minutes,
but he was not seriously injured.
Mayar Gardner on learning of the af
fair gave orders that the electric con
nection should be stopped. It was a
dangerous thing to do, and might
have resulted in serious injury to
some one. Peck claimed he connect
ed the wire up to prevent toughs from
breaking down the canvass, but there
has never been any trouble of this
kind at anay of the Chautauquas ever
held in Leon.
We Need a Fountain.
Leon is sorely in need of a drink
ing fountain. We have a splendid
system of water works, plenty of wa
ter, but people who attend the Satur
day evening band concerts, and on
other occasions have no place to se
cure a drink of water except from the
pumps in the wells in the court house
park. Just watch the children play
ing around these wells, notice the un
a a a
agree with us that we need a sanitary
drinking fountain where people can
get a good drink of water without
fear of contracting disease. Here
would be a good opportunity for some
of the clubs of the city to do some
good work by&starting a fund to .in
stall a drinking fountain, or inducing
the board of supervisors to install
one in the park.
McGinnis Will Do Campaign Work.
V. R. McGinnis has been requested
by the Democratic National Commit
tee to make a number of speeches, in
other st&te? during the coming presi
dential campuJgn, and the Deipocrat'c
State Committee of Iowa, has also
asked him to give them at least two
weeks of his time to speak at various
places in, Iowa. Mr. McGinnis is one
of the finest and most logical cam
paign speakers in the state of Iowa,
and the fact that the National Com
mittee has requested his services in
tne national campaign is a tribute to
his ability as a campaign orator. He
will endeavor to arrange his law
business so as to devote as much time
as possible to campaign work, and
expects to speak in several states dur
ing the campaign.

JOE WHITE IN TROUBLE
former Notoribus Leon Citizen In
Jail at St. Joe, Charged with
Consiracy in Murder Case.
Joe White, at one time a resident
of Leon for a short time, is in jail at
St. Joe, Mo., charged with conspiracy
in connection with the murder of the
wife of prosecuting attorney Oscar D.
McDaniel in that city on the night of
July 14tli. White had an unenviable
reputation while he resided in this
city and the authorities and every
body else were mighty glad when he
moved to St. Joe. James Vaughn,
who it is claimed was one of the men
White tried to incriminate, was also
a resident of Leon for several years,
but the whole Vaughn family left
hern several years ago.
The following account of the affair
is taken from the St. Joe News-Press
of last Saturday:
.Toe White, a south St. Joe police
character, was araigned in Justice
Wilson's court toaay on a charge of
conspiracy to procure the arrest of
one Perry Holiday by wrongfully ac
cusing him of the murder of Mrs.
Harriett Moss McDaniel, wife of Os
car D. McDaniel, prosecuting attor
ney, the night nf July 14. White
pieadea not guilty, and his case was
set for trial August 16th.
Holiday was arrested by the sheriff
in Kansas City, Kan., several days
ago, was brought to St. Joe, "sweat
ed" by the police and discharged. Ap
parently there was no reason to be
lieve that he had any knowledge of
the McDaniel murder.
The circumstances of the White
case are peculiar and singularly in
volved. A week ago he displayed to
Prosecuting Attorney McDaniel the
following letter which he said he had
received from Kansas City, Kan.:
Kansas City, Kan., 8-4-16 Joseph
White, Dear Sir: I thought I would
write you a few lines to let you know
that I am well and hope you are the
same. I was at your place. .Well
Joe how is the PROS CUTING ATOR
NEY geting along Have you forgot
what I told you the last time I saw
you. I told you I would get that
if I had the whole bunch to get and 1
aim to make my words true I fired 3
shots ad they fired 4 but I was so
nervous that my gun flew straight up
and dont know wheather hit him or
not it is a such (cinch? I got part of
them ad will tier (tear?) his head off
befor I quit so tell the boys they need
to worry for this PRCS ATOtiNEY so
I an Shie will be up Sat sure to give
this letter to Mine (Minnie Himmel
burg, daughter of Joe White I am
going to do as I agreed to do wilf
close.
From Jim Vawn and Shie S Burn
this letter up as soon as you read it
and dont tell nothing.
It is the theory of the prosecuting
attorney that White, by means of this
letter sought to incriminate James
Vaughn and Perry ^hi) Holiday,
both of whom are known to the po
lice. Vaughn, whose home is near
Leon, Iowa, was sent to the peniten
tiary four years ago, and served eigh
teen months for guntoting. His pres
ent whereabouts are unknown. Holi
day has been arrested by the St. Joe
police a number of times on petty
charges, but there is no record-ef his
having been convicted. For some
time he has been making his home in
Kansas City, Kan.
Relatives of White identified the
handwriting in the foregoing letter
as that of one Jack McVey, a south
end character and friend of White,
and McVey, when arrested, admitted
he wrote it at White's solicitation.
"White came to me," said McVey
to the prosecuting attorney, "and said
he wanted me to write a letter for
him. He said he had received a let
ter from x^ansas City, Kan., and had
lost it, but that he remembered what
the letter said, and wanted me to
make a copy of it as he dictated. Then"
he told me what the letter said, and I
wrote it off."
A specimen of McVejrs" handwrit
ing was obtained and the prosecuting
attorney says it corresponds perfect
ly with tuat in the \J£hite letter.
Wliite, when confronted with these
facts, admitted all that McVey had
said.
"That's all true, said White. "He
did make a copy of the letter for me.
but after he made it, I found the or
iginal letter which I had lost, and the
letter I gave you (McDaniel) is the
original."
The only flaw in this story, the
prosecuting attorney says, is the fact
that the "original" letter is in the
handwriting of McVey.
The-authorities are unable to ad
vance a satisfactory explanation of
White's activity in the matter and
are at a loss for a motive. White was
in trouble at the time, being charged
with the theft of a large quantity of
copper wire belonging to the strwt
railway company, and when the let
ter was written was out of jail on
bond. Some think that White hoped
the prosecutor would be lenient with
him in the larceny case if he deliver
ed a "clew' in the murder case.
In default of bond White was com
mitted to jail today to await trial
on the conspiracy charge.

Big Circus and Great Spectacle Oc
cupy Five Trains Crammed
With Wonders.
The big event for which the young
sters and grownups have been im
patiently waiting is drawing near lor
on Monday, August 21, RingUng
Bros.' circus is to exhibit afternoon
and night in Des Moines. Expectancy
never ran so high before and it is
likely that this district will send a
large delegation to feed the els
phants. Unusual interest centers
around the gigantic spectacle, "Cin
drella," with which the famous
showmen are this season opening
tiheir wonderful main tent program.
'jCindrella" is probably the best lov
ed of all fairy tales and to see it
produced with more than 1000 per
sons, hundreds of dancing girls and
glorious pageants, indeed give prom
ise of making "childhood's" golden
dreams come true." in the same great
tent, will come the marvelous circus
numbers in which 400 men and wom
en performers, scores of trained ani
mals and a galaxy of special features
are introduced. The majority of th^
acts are entirely new to America, the
Ringling Bros, having secured the
pick of those European performers
who have been obliged to seek en
gagements in this country because of
the war. The all new street parade
will take place show day morning.
When We Were Young and Rode a
liicycle.
In glancing over the Indianola Ad
vocate-Tribune last week we found
|he following item in their column of
tnirty years ago, and, what memories
bf our boyhood days it brought back.
fWe well remember this trip, which
occupied a week, and what a change
there has been in the country roads
since then. At that time many of
them were mere cow paths, and such
hills as there was, for nobody ever
thought of cutting down a hill in
those days, and such a thing as a
road drag was unknowrn:
O. E. Hull, of the Chariton Herald
for.ce, and Fred Voiland, of the Char
iton Democrat office, came over from
Chariton on their wheels last Sunday
and interviewed the wheelmen of our
town and the editor's table then they
and Frank Schooley mounted their
noiseless steeds and started for Des
Moines to join the wheelmen of the
state on their annual tour. They go
tnis year to Spirit Lake, with route
mapped out as follows: Leave Des
koines at 1 p. m. Monday, the 9th,
then go via Waukee to Adel, twenty
three miles Tuesday via Redfield,
Linden, Panora andj-lerndon to Jef
ferson, forty-six miles Wednesday to
Lohrville, twenty-three miles. Here
they will take the train for Fonda, to
miss some very rough road. Friday
they mount their wheels again, riding
to Sioux Rapids for dinner, and then
on to Spencer, a forty mile ride. Sat
urday they ride twenty miles to Ar
nold's Park, on Lake Okoboji. They
expect to have all the fun they want
on the wheel on the outward trip, and
will return by rail next week.
Leon H—Bethany 2.
The Leon base ball team were
scheduled to play at Bethany, Mo.,
last Sunday, but heavy rain at Beth
aany prevented their playing, so the
game was transferred to the Leon
grounds. Leon won by a score of
8 to 2, Moies being in the box for
Leon. The Bethany pitcher objected
to the location of the pitcher's box
and on measuring it was found to
be three feet too far from the home
plate. Leon secured 5 scores in the
first inning, before the box was
changed, and had it been located
properly in the start, the score would
no doubt have been different.
They'll Miss C. M. Akes at the State
Fair.
(7. M. Akes, who has been chief
marshal at the Iowa State Fair for
many years, will be misced by the ex
hibitors and public this year. He has
served so long that he was regarded
as a fixture, and last week received
a letter from the board of directors
requesting him to serve as chief mar
shal again this year, but he has de
clined the place on account of hav
ing too much business right here at
home to looJt after. He expects to
drive up in his auto and spend a day
or so at the fair visiting, but is not
going to do pny work.
Oats a Good Yield.
Reports from the fields near La
moni where the threshing machines
are humming are to the effect that
oats are yielding as high as 55 bush
els to the acre with an average of
about 30 bushels. The quality is
first class. The fine weather we have
been having has offered an excellent
opportunity for haying and harvest
ing. We doubt if a finer crop of
hay and small grain was ever harvest
ed in Decatur county.—Lamoni
Chronicle.
