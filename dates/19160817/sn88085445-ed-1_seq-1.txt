Register Saturday, Governor Asks
Make Saturday, August 19, n general day of registration through
out the Siate, is the plea of Governor Ernest Lister In the following
statement to the people issued this week:
A movement has been inaugurated lo many parts of the State for
the designation of Saturday, August 19th, as Rural Registration D ty.
Up to the present time, registration in the rural precincts
throughout the State tuts moved s owly and thousands of voters must
yet place their names on tbe dookb before they can take pari in tie
approaching elections.
The next general election, which will occur in November, is of
special importance, for in addition to the selection of national, state
and county officials, the voters of Washington have several import
ant initiative and referendum measures coming before them for 808 1
sideral ion.
I therefore join in urging all who have not yet regis'ejfd, wheth
er In city or rural precincts, but [Specially in rural precincts where
the registration lias been backward, to set aside Saturday, August 19lh,
as Registration Day and would suggest that all who have not yet reg
istered do so on that day, and also urge their neighbors to register.

Thursday afternoon just before (I
o'clock. He had reached 7th and
Front Streets; a buggy was s'.OWjy
preceding him, and he turned Sharp
ly to the left to pass i', placing
himself directly in the path of a
Bellingham stage. The driver, Al
bert McSorley, made every effort lo
avoid striking him, without avail.
The lit tie boy was carried to his
home, where he died a few mlßUtea
later.
Funeral services were heTd in the
Christian Reformed Church Satur
day. A great crowd was in attend
ance, and many beautiful flowers
sent, tokens of how deeply the sad
accident had stirred the comniunitv.
The children of the Lynden Chris
tian School marched to the Church
in a body, four of the schoolboys,

assured us that the matter would
be carefully checked In order that
ihe discrepancy might be verified

It has been the practice that
whenever local Improvement bonds

issue local improvement warrants
to cover the amount. Handling ihe
matter In this manner makei the
accounting cumbersome, therefore
it. is recommended that the practice
be discontinued.
