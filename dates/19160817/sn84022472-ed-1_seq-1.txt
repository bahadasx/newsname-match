t 'New Haven, Aug. 17. Ma
chinists at the Winchester Re-i
peating Arms Co. went on
' strike this" afternoon - for the
v. eight , hour - day. Their action
follows a strike vote that has
been taken in everv department
.of the factory during the last
few weeks. . '
', Harry Housont chairman of
' the strikdreominitteei' tbid The"
' Farmer this afternoon that 5,
000 machine workers," includ
irig 2,500 specialists are out. He
declared a , big demonstration
occurred during the noon hour
outside the plant.
An 1 official ' statement , from
t the Winchester factory this af
ternoon saysi "At the outside,
100 are on strike. 1 After a care
ful count we have figured that
the excessive absentees number
in the neighborhood of 100, not
counting six who are on leave
of absence. 'From an observa
tion pf the situation, we should
r say the strike was a fizzle."
Chairman Houson declared shortly
before press hour today: - ':The strike
was called for 12 o'clock, and at 1
o'clock I estimated that 5,000 failed to
. respond to the' factory whistles. In
, the morning officials of the plant went
among the men and threatened to lock
the doors against them if they talked

"Some gauge. makers Joined ' us,
which was unexpected.
"There will be a big mass meeting
: tonight on the Green, when plans will
be made for tomorrow, when more are
expected to leave." '
, A strike of union metal workers
who, during a .campaign by organiz
ers of the machinists 'international
' union, . covering, many months, have
been holding meetings and open air
'gatherings in advocacy of the eight-
hour day, has been expected from
time to time.: - No strike of conse
quence materialized although in the
late winter a number of metal work
ers left their work. . ' -
The explanation given by the lead
ters was' that the strike is a prema
ture one in that the strike, movement
was to have been a concerted one
under the lead of Bridgeport machin
ists. There are about 2.600 . ma
chinists among: the 18,000 employes.
The labor men expect other, metal
workers to act sympathetically with
the machinists. Thomas J. Savage,
. . of the executive board of the machin
ists' union, reached here last night
. to assume charge of the situation.
In his Initial statement today, with
out mentioning what -the machinists
seek, he said that efforts to "avert
; cessation of work had failed" because
"the company took the position that
there is nothing to give and nothing
- to arbitrate."
The shop committee stated that at
the conference with company officials
they were asked to sign a paper on
"which there were two questions, in
fcrief, whether they were satisfied with
conditions as they exist and whether
they could continue at work if condi
tions were not. changed. Those who
answered 11 the negative, say they
. were discharged. f
The concessions asked of the com
. pany in short were: An eight-houx
day with overtime as time and a half;
wages to be Increased so that there
was no change in that respect with
lessened hours; 'the company to adjust

(Special to The Farmer.) .
New York, Aug. 17 The United
States, submarine G-1, the only craft
in the United States which will have a
gyroscope stabilizer, has met with an
accident which will delay her trials
in Long Island Sound.
A pair -of diving rudders which
were made especially for the vessel
at the Brooklyn navy yard, cracked,
an new ones will have to be cast be
fore the ndersea boat can be made
ready for tests,
The G-1 was built in Bridgeport
under the name "Seal." It is the first
submarine ever fitted with torpedo
tubes that could be trained to fire to
either broadside. All other United
States submarines must manoeuvre to
bring the axes of the ship in line with
the target before firing. -' The man
oeuvring is very apt to betray the
position of the submarine's periscope
when moving through he water. In
cidentally the G-1 is the only United
States submarine known to have a
diving compartment, among the first
to be "fitted with a "drop-keel" and
holds the submergence - depth record.
It is the last boat to pass acceptance
tests by the United States gdvernment.

ATTY. MORSE TO
APPEAL DECISION
OF JUDGE MILLER
Will Contest. His Removal
As Trustee of Lucinda
Ward Estate.
Attorney Joseph B. Morse of New
Haven has filed in the probate court
notice of his intention to appeal from
the decision of judge "Paul L. Miller
removing him as trustee of the 'estate
of Lucinda Ward. May (Ward, of
Huntington avenue, widow -of Harry
C. Ward, has also filed notice of her
intention to appeal from the decision
of Judge "Miller, ruling that she is
not an heir to the Lucinda Ward es
tate. The matter will now have a
hearing before the superior court for
final adjustment.
The Lucinda Ward estate is esti
mated at $20,000. Harry C. Ward, of
this city, the only surviving heir, died
in Bermuda. He had the lire use of
the Income. Judge Miller then de
cided that Brownlee Robertson, Ward
of New Haven, nephew of Harry C.
Ward, was the only heir. The Judge
at the same time ordered the trustee
to make an accounting. This Attor
ney Morse refused to do. Judge Mil
ler then removed him and appointed
Attorney William H. Comley, Jr., in
his place. Mrs. Ward, widow of
Harry C. Ward, applied for a share in
the estate as an heir. Judge Miller
disallowed'her claim. Judge A. Hea
ton Robertson is attorney for Brown
lee Robertson Ward, and long litiga
tion appears probable before settle
ment is made.

HEALTH EXPERT
i
Planning Public Welfare De
partment Where No Ques

MONEY READY FOR
GETTING A START
Criticises System of Inquisi
tion Applicants For
Treatment Suffer.
The best obtainable medical treat
ment and medical advice for the poor,
at municipally-owned clinics and a
city hospital where it will be assumed
that the applicant is honest, will be
afforded In - Bridgeport if the plans
of Dr. Abraham Sophian are carried
out. v
' "The poor have no place to go in
Bridgeport," said Dr. Sophian this
morning, "it is the duty of the city
to provide for them."
In discussing his plans Dr. Sophian
criticised the system of Inquisition,
that is in use at the emergency hos
pital in this city, where the entire
history and business of an applicant
is drawn from him before treatment
will be given, even In urgent cases.
At the same time, he declared that
the charities department's name
should e changed, because it is not
charity to care for the poor. He de
clared that the health and charities
department should be merged lftto, a
public welfare department, the duty
of which would be to afford medical
and other aid to those who can't afT
ford to pay for it or can afford to
pay little. : . ...
He commended the editoriaj stand
of The Farmer that Bridgeport should
apply Itself to lessening the infant
mortality by an intelligent expendi
ture of funds now used in more or
less efficient manner.
."The poor of Bridgeport have no
place to go," ,said Dr. Sophian.
Bridgeport should have supplied
adequate facilities for them long ago.
"The facilities will be ' provided
now, and yotf believe me, when the
plans are carried out, the infant mor
tality -here will drop like a shot. That
has-been the experience of other cit
ies. "There should be no charities de
partment.' The name conveys a false
Impression. There should be a pub
lic welfare department, combining the
functions of the two.
"The people of Bridgeport had
raised $75,000 to be expended on clin
ics. Whether or not this will be
enough, I don't know, but I do know
that if it isn't, and the neeji of the
changes is sufficiently understood, the
people, will not hesitate to give more.
"These clinics should be established
in a central structure,, containing the
public welfare department. In charge
will be a man who understands the
bacteriological treatment, skin disease
treatment and veneral disease treat
ment. The physicians will be men
who are thoroughly proficient. They
will be the best men obtainable, who
will serve the city without pay.
"When they are established, the
clinics will make the infant moi-tality
rate drop. For instance, now, the
child of poor parents,, when -taken ill
with diarrhoea often gets no treatment
because the parents are too poor to
get a doctor. They wait until the child
Is in the last stages, then they have
to get a physician or let the child die.
' "With the clinics available, where
the poor will be welcomed, where no
questions will be asked, treatment
will be given while the illness is cura
ble. It is perfectly easy than; You
will find the infant mortality will de
cline greatly. ,
'"It will be -the same with tuberculo
sis. Every person who applies at the
city dispensary for treatment or medi
cine will be examined and his case
will be followed up . later at the home.
Thus, if there is, an incipient case of
tuberculosis,, it will be checked. Pre
ventative measures, not curative, are
the solution of the mortality problem.
"It will be the same with skin di
seases and venereal diseases. There
is no proper city aid for sufferers with
these ailments now. . Ignorance is re
sponsible for a large majority of the
cases. Education is the solution. This
may be supplied at the clinics.
"I am not in sympathy with the
system of inquisition in public wel
fare departments It should be as
sumed that all who ask for treatment
or advice are honest. As a rule, any
way, those who can afford private
treatment will seek it.
" "There Is no doubt that Bridgeport
will get these things. The money for
giving the start is ready. Private per
sons who thoroughly understand the
need of them have volunteered to sup
ply the money that will be needed for
the-study of the best institutions in
the country, and hiring the best ar
chitect obtainable.
"NOw is the time to put health mat
ters on an efficient basis."
No new cases were reported" today.

Morris Farm Loses Many
Valuable Fowl Through
Agency of Paris Green.
BELIEVE MAN GAVE
POISON IN REVENGE
Many Other Birds Still In
Danger of Death From
Arsenical Poison.
A discharged employe of the. famous
Morris ehicken farm of Nichols, which
raises nothing but shdw birds and
pedigreed laying fowl, is charged with
having distributed parts green among
the 1,000 birds in the pens.
The poison, to which chickens are
attracted on account of its color and
flavor, is said by the deputy sheriffs
and state police engaged in the Inquiry,
to have resulted in the death of 87
birds, valued at more than $1,500 by
their owner, Robert Morris.
The powder was distributed during
the night of Monday. The death rate
on ' Tuesday was comparatively light.
There was a higher ratio yesterday
and it is expected from the condition
of the remaining birds that nearly
three-quarters of the great flock will
succumb within the next three days.
In this event the loss will total nearly
13,000. ;
As a result of Investigation by Dep
uty ..Sheriff Frank Olmstead, A.J
French, ' Sheriff Simeon Pease and
State Policeman Frank Virelll, Charles
Zimmerman,- aged 29, a former em
ploye of the Morris farm was placed
under arrest and is said to have ad
mitted after several hours" question
ing that the wholesale- poisoning was
the result of his discharge and done
for, revenge. He is held for examina
tion before Justice Elmore T. Nichols
on Saturday, Aug. 26.
The Morris farm, located in Nichols,
is one of the best known in New Eng
land. , For several years exceptional
strains of Light Wyandottes, Rhode
Island Reds and Buff Rocks have
been raised there. The birds are well
known in this and other cities where
they have been placed on exhibition
and have carried off many honors.
In-order to prevent interbreeding,
the birds are all kept in small pens,
some even in individual pens. This
made the distribution of any poison
a hard matter for one person acting
in the night season. . i (
It is alleged by the authorities that
Zimmerman, upon whose clothing
parts green is said to have been found
when suspicion pointed towards him,
placed the poison In the "mash"
which is made up in large quantities
and then distributed it at feeding
time in the morning.
The chickens began to droop and
die Tuesday. Immediate analysis was
made of- the contents of crops of the
birds with the result that arsenical
poison was found in large quantities.
Inspection of the feed showed that a
large quantity in . storage had been
poisoned in like manner. . -
So great has the death rate among
the chickens become that special pre
cautions for burial of the bodies have
been made on the farm, where they
are thrown in a large trench and
immediately covered with -earth.
The act will ruin the season's busi
ness of the Morris farm, though ef
forts will be made to immediately re
establish the strain from surviving
birds in other sections. '

To Save Her Child
Danbury, Aug. 17 Mrs. Joseph
Bacher, of New York, narrowly es
caped death while trying to rescue
her infant son from a burning house
in Miry Brook district, west of this
city, last night. Mrs. Bacher, who
was visiting there, dropped a lighted
lamp at the head of a stairway lead
ing to the room where her child was
asleep and her clothes took fire as
she carried the child down the burn
ing stairs. The house, which was
owned by Joseph Buzaide, a farmer,
was destroyed with a loss of $2,500.
Registrars .Believe
Population 175,000
The registrars of voters are inclined
to believe . that the population of
Bridgeport is nearer 175,000 than
147,000, tlfe latter being the estimate
of the publishers of the new city di
rectory. The canvas of the registrars
for the voting lists is not complete but
the canvas to -date indicates that the
lists of voters will be increased from
18,779 last year, to about between
25,000 and 27,000 this year. The
canvas of the registrars discloses
many names and many voters who are

Pending their arrival he does not plan to see the committee

The President sent the following telegram lo the leading!
railroad presidents: " ' j
"Discission of the matters involved in the threatened rail-i

that I should personally confer with you at the earliest possible i
moment and with the presidents of any other railways affected
who may be immediately accessible. I hope you can make it!
convenient to come to Washington at once." '
The President's action in asking for the conference with!
railroad presidents themselves is interpreted as meaning that!
the managers' committee had refused finally to concede the 8-1
hour day as the President's plan proposed, and the question nowt
is to be taken up with the heads of the railroads themselves. 1

The situation as it stood today was this: .

do everything possible to arrange

In case President Wilson- finds any
of the railroad presidents cannot
speak absolutely for their roads ha
may Invite to the White House th
flananciers who control them. Offi
cials said today that the President
wants to deal with the "ultimate au-
thority" on both sides In order that
negotiations may be considered here.
, Immediate acceptance of the Pres- ,
ident's plan appeared improbable. Th .
railroads insist on arbitration and1 the
employes are equally resolute that
they-be conceded pay for overtime
work equivalent to one and a half
times the usual rate.
Representatives of the ' railroads
were prepared tov maintain that the
entire principle of arbitration is at
stake. They also were, mindful that j
when they applied recently . to the in- ;
terstate , commerce commission for a
fire per cent, freight rate Increase the '
commission Intimated tTiat when the
railroads grant , higher wages -without

Among the managers it was pointed
out that the presidents have been con
utantly Adviied of the negotiations with .
President Wilpon and the feeling pre-'
vails that the attitude of the railroad
heads was now. the same as the man-ipel-s
committee, although' no one
could forecast what effect a personal ,
conference with, the President would:
have. The la'lroad presidents are ex- j
pected to make, a strong plea for pre-;
serration of the, principal of arbitra

between President Wilson and the 640

the East Room of the White House,
the scene of many notable events.
. Another indications of the delicacy
of the mtuatioii was seen In the de

intended to publish the President's
stnter.ient and then his statement to.
tlic niimngcrs, thus laying the contest
before the high court of public opin

was hope of moving the committee of

or the financiers, the negotiation!
would be kept confidential.
