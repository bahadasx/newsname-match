Camp Llano Grande, August 10.
Just one month ago today we entrained
at Fort Snelling for some unknown
point on the border. It has been a
month that no member of the com
pany will soon forgetthe five-day
trip through a strange country to most
of us, the camp making and the sub
sequent soldiers' training that is be
ginning to have its effect on the men
and if continued long enough will
make real soldiers out of us amateurs.
That question of "how long are we
going to stay here?" is still the main
topic of conversation and there is no
disputing the fact that there are a
lot of homesick young men in this
camp. We refer to the camp as a
whole, but will admit we have our
share of afflicted ones in Company G.
A natural condition if you stop to
ponder on the situation and circum
stances.
The monotony of camp life was
somewhat broken for the company
last week, for it was their turn to do
regimental guard duty. And here's
where the weather man slipped in a
little joker on the outfit. The tour
of duty extended from 7 p. m. Satur
day to 7 p. m. Sunday, and about 8
o'clock Saturday night word was re
ceived at the guard house that a tor
nado was reported from Brownsville
headed this way. And it was no false
alarm, for about thirty minutes after
the report came in the forerunner of
the storm was on the job and in an
other hour it was blowing a gale and
the ram came down in torrents. In
fact, it was a regular gulf storm and
it took all night for it to blow itself
out. It was the hardest and worst
storm that we have tiad since we hit
this neck of the woods, and was out
in the whole performance, walking
sentry and relieving the guards when
their two-hour shift of sentry duty
was over. The guard house was flooded
during the first hour of the storm and
there wasn't a dry spot left big enough
to throw a blanket on. The two re
liefs not on duty were ordered back
to their company tents and got some
little sleep there, but before the night
was over every member of the guard
was completely drenched and* when
Company marched up to relieve
them Sunday evening we were all glad
to get out.
The storm did considerable damage
around the camp. Several of the tents
were blown down, others and the con
tents and occupants thereof were
thoroughly drenched and it took prac
tically all of Sunday to gpt the camp
back in shipshape again. Companies
A and suffered the worst from the
storm, as they are down the lower
part of the regimental street and the
water naturally drifted down their
way. Some of the other companies
took unholy glee in watching A, the
Duluth millionaire company, out
wallowing around the mud and wa
ter next morning. Sergeant Umbe
hocker saved one cook's life early Sun
day morning when he rescued the poor
"dough boy" from a hay mattress
which was floating around in a foot
or so of water.
Lieut. Morton was officer of the day
and Lieut. Kalkman commander of
the guard. Both performed their
arduous duties with promptness and
dispatch and thereby reflected credit
on themselves and their organization.
Lieut. Morton has also been appointed
as one of the instructors for the non
commissioned officers' school and is
making good in this important ap
pointment. "Mort" is one of the most
conscientious and best posted lieuten
ants the regiment.
The company has been quite heavily
drawn on for outside details, some of
which are as follows: Sergt. H. H.
Nelson, in charge of regimental can
teen Anfinson and Flink, postal clerks
in the camp postoffice Umbehocker
and Flink in regimental band, and
Sergt. Carmody, according to a recent
report, on recruiting detail.
Umbehocker's transfer to the band
left a sergeantcy vacant and Jack Car
mody was appointed to fill the place.
Jack has been in the service a long
time and will make good in his new
position. A. I. Nelson and Lee San
ford have also been awarded corporal's
stripes for efficient services and
soldierly conduct.
Last Sunday the Third regiment
ball team defeated a team represent
ing the First regiment, by the score
^tlitm^mmi^iiiimi^tifMitMm
of 5 to 3. Inasmuch as was on
none of the Princeton or Milaca
big leaguers got into the fracas.
The weather continues to surprise
us and for the first ten days of August
we have not had a single scorcher.
Probably you home folks can't say
this much.
Ralph Olmstead, a member of the
company who joined at Milaca, re
ceived his honorable discharge and
has gone back to Minneapolis where
he is employed by the Minneapolis Gas
company. "Skinny," as he was called,
was dismissed because physically unfit
for service owing to a slight hernia
which he has had for ten years, but
which began to bother him when he
took up the arduous duties of a soldier.
Everybody is anxiously awaiting
payday, as they have not received a
cent from the government since they
have been in the service. Just before
they left Snelling each enlisted man
received from the state $16.50, this
being the amount due from it, and the
balance, together with the July pay,
they still have coming from Uncle
Sammy. Pretty slow pay when you
stop to think of what the "Uncle" de
mands of the boys and the meager
rate of wages that prevails in the
army. Some more of the government
red tape that you hear so much about
is probably responsible for this con
dition of affairs.
Captain Davis of the regular army,
who is assigned to our regiment as
instructor, is the typical type of the
reguar army (officer.

Efficient, thor
ough, courteous and still a strict
disciplinarian. He is well liked by the
officers and men of the regiment but
we sometimes wonder if he doesn't
have a quiet little laugh in private at
some of our antics in trying to be
come regulars.
We now have a tented city of about
15,000 men, although the linotype man
in the August 3rd issue had it only
1,200, when it was 12,000 at that time.
That northern heat that you people
are suffering from probably made the
figures blur.

Farmers Will Derive Greatest Benefits.
Bob Dunn hits the right heart string
the core of every true Minnesotan
when he says, "the matter of an offi
cial designation is of little value unless
the roads are there to entice the peo
ple to travel in any particular section.
Get the roads and all else will follow."
We might add also "have something at
the end of the road." Cass Lake's
forests make the greatest playgrounds
in the world, a little park of white pine
and Norway on islands and points
nestled among springfed lakes, flanked
by some of the best farm lands
the state of Minnesota make it a land
of opportunity for the settler and a
paradise for resorters. We have ev
erything a town might want all that
is necsssary now is to reach out and
tap the highways around us by well
built and well kept turnpikes. Soon
all roads would lead to Cass Lake and
the "gem of the north" would become
the hub of a great agricultural region
and the most beautiful of American
playgrounds.Cass Lake Times.
Cass Lake is one of the scores of
attractive spots on the route of the
Minnesota Scenic Highway. While
the Scenic Highway will render acces
sible beautiful resorts for tourists and
pleasure-seekers, it is the farmers who
will derive the greatest benefit, par
ticularly those along the eastern and
northern ends of the loop. That part
of the Highway that passes through
Mille Lacs county will be of immense
benefit to the farmers for miles on
either side of it.
Lieut. Kalkman Promoted.
An Associated Press report from
Brownsville, Texas, conveys the in
formation that a number of second
lieutenants from the national guard
have been drafted into the regular
service, and among them appears the
name of Eugene C. Kalkman, second
lieutenant of Company G, Third Min
nesota. Lieut. Kalkman has been
assigned to the Twenty-sixth U. S.
infantry. The militia officers will serve
with the regiments to which they have
been assigned until they have satisfied
the commanding officer that they are
qualified to accept commissions. This
is in the nature of a promotion for
Lieut. Kalkman.
Married Men to Return.
Three of the married members of
Company are now speeding back to
Minnesota, and the other married
members will start on their return trip
in the near future.
A telegram from Llano Grande,
Texas, received by T. M. Olson Tues
day morning contained the news that
L. F. Wilkes and Eldon and Ralph
Jones had departed for Snelling the
previous afternoon, that Escherisch
would leave in about three days, and
that Smith, Doane, Shockley and the
other married men would leave in a
week or ten days. The telegram also
stated that all the boys are well.
SMDERSJEFEATED
By Princeton's Speedy Diamond Stars
at the Fair Grounds Last
Sunday Afternoon.
Locals Play Shut-Out Ball for Six
Snappy InningsThe Final
Score is 7 to 5.
N The victorious march of the Prince
ton base ball team to the state cham
pionship was not even momentarily
halted at the fair grounds last Sunday,
when the Snyders of Minneapolis op
posed "Pongo's" peppery pastimers,
and the locals stowed the game away
by a count of 7 to 5. For six innings
the Princetonians played rings around
their opponents, and six large ciphers
on the score board represented the
scoring efforts of the Minneapolis per
formers. Princeton slowed up in the
seventh and eighth frames long
enough to allow five of the visitors to
cross the tabulating rubber, however.
Michaud was on the hill top for
Princeton, and delivered a classy
article of ball. Only four hits were
collected off of his delivery, and while
three of these were bunched, on the
whole his performance was very satis
factory. In the strike-out division he
fairly scintillated, sending 13 back to
the dog house on strikes. Skahen was
at the receiving station, and his work
was all that could be desired. Glass
and Barsteen were in the points for
the visitors, and weathered the storm
in good condition.
After blanking their opponents in
the first round, the locals tore into
the offerings of Glass right briskly,
and two of the local pastimers can
tered across the plate. Jesmer was
first up, and he drew a pass. Berg
was retired, and Caley, the reliable,
lifted out a man's sized clout with his
bludgeon. The blow carried him to
second, and scored Jesmer. Captain
Mallette then came to bat, andbang!
A steaming drive to left field counted
Caley, and carried Mallette to second.
Staples walked, but Skahen and Pet
terson were retired, and the side took
to the field.
The second and third stanzas saw
no scoring, but in the fourth Petter
son, Roos and Michaud tramped across
the registering station for Princeton.
Shut-out ball on both sides featured
the fifth and sixth rounds also, but in
the seventh the visitors penetrated the
Princeton defense, and broke into the
run column by pushing three over the
plate. Princeton started its scoring
machine also, and put the game on ice
this round, when Caley and Mal
lette counted.
The visitors made a desperate at
tempt the eighth, but but failed to
reach Princeton, although they short
ened the margin separating the teams
by grabbing two more runs.
NOTES.
Caley's bat is proving a valuable
asset to the team.
Staples pulled off a couple of nice
catches the center garden.
H. J. Plaas and a gentleman from
Minneapolis handled the umpiring to
the satisfaction of all.
Berg has been hitting out of luck
of late, but he will undoubtedly soon
regain his stride.
Michaud and Skahen make up a
truly classy battery. They are both
there and then some.
Joe Mossman was not at the game
and some of the more superstitious
attribute Princeton's failure to score a
shut-out to his absence.
For next Sunday "Pongo "Olson has
scheduled the powerful Merchants Ho
tel aggregation of St. Paul, and a
ripping contest is assured. Why
miss it?
Princeton has a real ball team, but
it is not being properly supported. A
goodly crowd was in attendance, but
expenses exceeded the receipts by
over six dollars.
Yeomen Organized at Zimmerman.
The Brotherhood of American Yeo
men organized at Zimmerman last
Thursday evening with a class of 30
members. District Deputy Tiel and
State Manager Murphy had charge of
the ceremonies and visitors from Elk
River and Princeton attended. After
the obligation had been given the class
by Mr. Murphy, a recess was called
during which ice cream and cake was
served to the members and visitors.
After recess Zimmerman Homestead
No. 5545 was called to order by Mr.
Murphy, and election of officers was in
order. The following were duly elected
and installed: Foreman, Lyle D. Iliff
M. of C, Neil J. Neumann correspond
ent, Goldie A. Hetrick M. of A., Ar
thur F. Olson chaplain, Ellen Jenni
son overseer, Wm. E. Barnes watch-
man, John McCormick sentinel, Roy
Iliff guard, Floyd N. Neumann Lady
Rowena, Myrtle B. Iliff Lady Rebec
ca, Sophia Backman.
During the evening, talks were
made by Messrs. Murphy and Tiel and
Mr. Chas. Kaliher of the Elk River
Homestead, as well as other visiting
members. The officers of Zimmerman
Homestead readily assumed their new
duties and a very bright future is in
prospect.
Fine SceneryPoor Roads.
Under the caption "Fine Scenery
Poor Roads," this item appeared in the
St. Cloud Journal-Press:
H. R. Neide and family have recent
ly returned from an auto trip from St.
Cloud to Mille Lacs lake. Mr. Neide
says that the road from Milaca to the
lake was about as bad as it could
be and be negotiated by an automo
bile. He was delighted with the
grandeur of the lake and says he is
not surprised that people in that sec
tion wanted it on the Jefferson high
way. From St. Albans to Brainerd
and from Brainerd to Rice the roads
were excellent. "I drove home by
way of Brainerd, which was twice
the distance, rather than go back
over the road from the lake to Mil-
aca," said he. "They are doing con
siderable work on this stretch of road
and when completed it will probably
be in good condition. Then it will be
a very popular drive, because the big
lake is well worth seeing."
There is considerable truth in the
above. The scenery in and around
Mille Lacs lake is simply grand, and
although there has been a great im
provement in the road from Milaca to
the lake, still it is nothing to blow
about. But if the Union's suggestions
are adopted ere another 12 months
roll around the road from Milaca, no,
from Minneapolis, to the lake, will be
in keeping with the scenery at Mille
Lacs.
Want a State Road.
Four Sherburne county farmers
Louis Brolin, member of the board of
supervisors of Becker, Ben W. Ander
son and Richard Johnson, also of
Becker, and Charles Kopperall of San
tiagowere in town Monday. They
were anxious to have the mam trav
eled road between Becker village and
Princeton designated as a state high
way. They claim that the road, which
passes through parts of Becker,
Santiago and Blue Hill, is poorly cared
To-^and in places is aknostampassable
and they think if a state road was
established it would receive better
care. It was only a few days ago that
a Santiago farmer called at this office
to complain of the lack of attention
bestowed on the state road leading
east from Santiago to Princeton. Our
own judgment is that there are al
ready too many state roads in Sher
burne county. It should be kept in
mind that the county is obliged to
maintain and keep in passable condi
tion all state roads, and with the
limited means at their disposalthe
proceeds a maximum tax of three
millsit is impossible for the county
commissioners to properly care for a
large mileage of state roads.
Parcel Post May Aid Farm Market.
How to enable the farmer to get a
little more for his products, at the
same time supplying it to the con
sumer for a little less than he now
pays, is a problem that the Postoffice
department is investigating. The in
vestigation is provided for in the ap
propriation bill which calls for three or
more separate demonstrations of the
efficiency of the parcel post system
in distributing farm products among
consumers.
The movement for the use of the
parcel post in distributing farm prod
ucts was started by the Southern Com
mercial congress. There are nine par
cels that go from the city to the coun
try to one that goes from the country
to the city.
The National Association of Com
missioners of Agriculture believes
that the government's machinery can
be used profitably in selling farm
products directly from the farm to the
consumer, just as it is used now to
distribute supplies from mail-order
houses., to farms.
Present Process Too Slow.
Piecemeal road improvement will
never get us anywhere in Mille Lacs
county. A comprehensive scheme of
road improvement, covering all the
main traveled highways of the county,
must be carried out. Once the main
roads are permanently improved the
major share of the state and county
road funds can be devoted to the lat
teral roads. If the right policy is pur
sued we can have a complete system
of good roads all over Mille Lacs
county within the next two or three
years. Under the present patchwork
system our roads may be maintained
after a fashion but it will be a long
time before we can have any really
permanent good roads.
COUNTY DADS* MEET
Board of County Commissioners Met
at Office of the County
Auditor on Tuesday.
Three New School Districts Formed
and Other Matters of Interest
Are Disposed of.
The board of county commissioners
met at the office of the county auditor
Tuesday, with all members present
and Chairman Cater presiding.
On motion duly made, seconded and
carried the sum of $300 was appro
priated out of the county revenue fund
and set aside as a county attorney's
contingent fund. Commissioners Ca
ter and Thomas voted no.
The resignation of John P. Soder
strom as county highway engineer was
presented to the board. Same was ac
cepted, and an order was adopted nam
ing James D. Gray as his successor.
Mr. Gray's salary will be fixed at the
next meeting.
The school petition of E. W. Goff and
others asking for the formation of a
new school district out of territory in
the town of Hayland came on for final
hearing, and same was granted. The
board also acted favorably on the peti
tition of J. A. Watson and others ask
ing for the formation of a new school
district out of territory in the town of
Hayland, and also on the petition of
John M. Schelin and others asking for
formation of a new district out of ter
ritory in the towns of Hayland and
Borgholm.
C. P. Jorgensen presented a petition
to the board asking that his lands be
set off from district 14 and attached to
district 25. September 12 was desig
nated as the date of hearing in the
matter.
On motion duly made and carried
Pluimer's plat of the S. W. of the
N. E. Vi of section 13, township 37,
was approved, accepted and ordered
placed on file.
Plats of the resurveys of sections
29 and 36 in Borgholm were presented
to the board and same were exam
ined, accepted and ordered filed. The
board then made its order of assess
ment in connection with said resur
veys, and assessed each quarter of a
section one-sixteenth of the costs of
said surveys. The costs of the resur
vey of section 29 totaled $239.36, and
of 36 $207.36.
A resolution was adopted providing
that when a new bridge is put in to
span O'Neil brook that the cost of
same be defrayed out of the road and
bridge funds of the third and fourth
commissioner districts.
After acting on the usual grist of
bills the board adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on September 12.
Flourishing Little Isle.
The writer was one of a party who
enjoyed a spin on f/Iille Lacs lake
from Cove to Isle in P. P. Blackstad's
staunch motorboat Sunday afternoon.
The distance covered, going and com
ing, was about 36 miles, and only one
corner of the lake was traversed. Mille
Lacs lake is no frog pond.
The scenery along the southeast
corner of the lake nit this season of
the year is beautiful in the superlative
degree.
Isle is a smart little village with
gravel-surfaced streets and cement
sidewalks. It^ boasts of several sub
stantial business houses. The First
State bank is a neat pressed brick
structure and is doing a good business.
The Advance weekly sets forth the
advantages of Isle. But the especial
pride of the place is the model co
operative creamery which opened for
business a few weeks ago and is al
ready turning out more than a ton of
first-class butter weekly.
Otto Haggberg conducts a comfort
able little hotel which looks very home
like right on the shore of the lake.
Charley Malone, one of the first
settlers, has retired from active busi
ness but is as full of vim and vinegar
as ever and is taking life easy.
By far the best developed farms in
the lake region are located in this
vicinity, and Isle is bound to grow and
prosper.
Proper Road Maintenance.
An article in last week's Anoka
Herald on road maintenance meets
with the hearty approval of the Union.
It is the best goods roads article that
ever appeared in the Herald. The
Herald condemns the present system
of road maintenance by farmers in
spare time, and takes the sensible
position that on the main traveled
roads maintenance men should be
hired by the montb. A man and team
could easily care for a 15 or 20 mile
stretch of roadr once it was placed in

good condition, at an expense of from
$25 to $40 per mile during the season.
Each maintenance man would be re
required to be on the job all the time
and would be held strictly responsible
for the proper upkeep of the road.
This is the proper and only correct
system for permanently maintaining
roads.
Late News Items.
Captain Henry A. Castle died yes
terday at his home at Silver Lake
near St. Paul. Captain Castle was a
veteran of the civil war and was for
many years connected with the St.
Paul Dispatch. He was also postmas
ter of St. PAUI during President Harri
son's administration. For many years
he figured prominently in state politics.
Just as the Union has asserted, the
investigation of conditions on the iron
range by the state labor department
proves that some of the miners have
real grievances. The report condemns
the hired guards employed by the
mining companies and condemns the
I. W. W. exploiters.
President Wilson is laboring hard to
bring about a truce between the rail
road managers and the brotherhood
leaders, and it is altogether likely that
he will be successful and that there
will be no general strike. A strike of
the railroad employes would paralyze
business in every section of the United
States and cause want and suffering
in every large city in the country.
Minnesota Road Conditions.
Mr. C. A. Jack, who recently re
turned from an automobile tour
through northern and southern Minne
sota, reports that road building is very
much in evidence in all sections of
Minnesota.
Mr. Jack encountered the best roads
of the trip in northern Minnesota.
Even in remote Cook county splendid
graveled highways are to be found.
The new roads being constructed there
are wide, there being room for three
automobiles to run abreast. Hills are
graded down, and Mr. Jack says the
highways are a source of pleasure.
Through the iron range country ex
cellent roads surfaced with gravel and
low grade ore are also to be found.
And the streets of the range cities and
villages are a joy forever.
In central and southern Minnesota
conditions are not so favorable, but
the work of improvement continues,
and in time all sections of Minnesota
will be blessed with good highways.
Mrs. Christ Jacobson.
Mrs. Christ Jacobson, an esteemed
resident of Bogus Brook, succumbed
to cancer last Friday after an illness
of several months, at the age of 55
years.
Funeral services were conducted
from the family residence Monday
morning at 10 o'clock, by Rev. C. Lar
son of Princeton, and were largely
attended. Interment was in Oak Knoll
cemetery.
Mrs. Jacobson has been a resident
of this county 15 years, and was a
loving wife and mother and a con
siderate neighbor. The husband and
four children survive her, viz: Mrs.
Ignatz Weisgram, Princeton, and
Rudolph, Albert and Mary.
The husband and children take this
means to extend their sincere thanks
to all who assisted them during their
recent bereavement. They are more
than grateful.
Glendorado Creamery Picnic.
A picnic will be held under the
auspices of the Glendorado creamery
on Sunday, August 20, 1916, and all
will be cordially welcomed.
A prominent speaker from the state
dairy and food department will talk on
dairying and an address will be given
by a representative of the extension
division of the university. Hon. Harold
Knutson, candidate for congress, will
also speak, and stirring band music
will entertain the multitude. A fast
base ball game will be staged for the
benefit of the lovers of the national
game, and a pleasant as well as
profitable day is promised those who
attend.
Refreshments will be served on the
grounds, but picnickers should bring
basket dinners.
Last Call for the Boys' Fund.
If there are any public-spirited peo
ple in Mille Lacs county who wish to
contribute to the fund for the boys in
Texas, let them do so before Saturday
evening. All subscriptions will be
duly acknowledged in the Union next
week.
