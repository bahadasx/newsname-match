Two Face Murder Charge at
Roselaud.
Roseland, La., Aug. 11.-Al.
phonse Watson, was shot and
killed here last night when he
fired upon Mayor S. E. Brown,
Marshal A. C, Germany, and
Murray Sharkey, who were at
tempting to arrest Watson. A
coroner's jury which concluded
the investigation of the killing,
sitting at Amite City, this after
noon rendered a verdict that
Watson came to his death thru
wounds inflicted by Brown, Ger
many and Sharkey and the kill
ing was a justifiable homicide.

slain man, then swore out war.
rants charging Brown and Shar
key with murder, and they were
arrested and lodged in the Tangi.
pahoa parish jail. Marshal Ger
many was also arrested in con
nection with the killing.
Watson had a large number of
relatives in the parish and they
are indignant over his death, al
though it is asserted that for
seveial days Watson had made
repeated threats that he intended
to kill Mayor Brown and Sharkey,
who is a swayer employed by the
Roseland Veneer and Package
Company.
Wednesday night Watson met
Sharkey in a barbor shop and
threatened his life. Sharkey, be
ing unarmed, made a hasty exit.
Last night Watson, who it is said
had been drinking heavily, is said
to have boasted that he would not
wait another day before killing
Sharkey. Mayor Brown, when
told that Shaakey was in danger,
sent for him to warn him to avoid
Watson.
Sharkey then armed himself
and requested Marshal Germany
to arrest Watson for making 1
threats. Germany swore in the
sawyer as a deputy and accom.
panied by Mayor Brown. they
went to Main street.
In a short time Watson came
by, Marshal Germany ordered
Watson to stop as he was under
arrest. Watsan at once drew his
revolver and began firing.
The three officers of the law
then fired and Watson fell. It is
said that the bullets which caus
ed the deaih were fired by Mayor
Brown against whom it is claimed
Watson nursed a grudge because
Mr. Brown had him indicted for
S perjury.
Watson was a widower, but
leaves a little girl of 13, who has
been residing with his sister, Mrs.
Iva S. Addison, at Greensburg.
The slain man has numerous rel.
atives there and in Areola and
Amite City.
Watson's burial was at Greens.

Farming Is The Best.
William Jennings Bryan gives
eight good reasons why young
men should choose farming in
preference to the other occupa.
tions and professions. Here they
are: (1) Farming is the most
independent way of living; (2)
less capital is required to start
farming than to enter any other
independent business; (3) all
members of the family can par
ticipate in some way in the work
ofthe farm; (4) farm life is
healthful; (5) farming develops
useful habits of industry and ap
plication; (6) the farm provides
the most wholesome environment
for growing children; (7) farm
life teaches the true philosophy
that labor is honorable and wor- i
thy of reward; (8) the farmer is
the most independent factor in
our political life.
Several American firms were

The Heiiitz LHuniting Bill.
Under the Heintz bill, as pass
ed by the legislature of 1916,
every man or boy who desires to
hunt must pay one dollar for a
hunter's license. Under the law,
as it sto6d before this bill was
passed, any one could hunt on
his own land or in his own ward
without paying a license. If he
desired to hunt outside of his
own ward in the parish, he could
do so by paying a license of fifty
cents, but if he wanted to go
outside of his own parish he
would have to procure a $3.00
State license. Under the new
law every man who hunts with
either dog or gun must have a
license.
There are but few people be
sides professional hunters who
care to hunt outside their own
parish and it is the professional
hunters that destroy our game. i
If Mr. Heintz wanted to save the I
people money, as he now says I
since he is running for District 1
Attorney, why did he saddle the
people with this extra tax?
The tax is very unfair. What
little game we have by rights
belongs to the people of the par- a
ish. It should be theirs to en
joy. t
Under the old law the outsider c
had to pay the license and our a
home people did not, but under
the Heintz bill every man who
shoots a rabbit, squirrel or bird
will have to pay $1.00 license or
be subject to prosecution.
A Stump Cutter That Saves i

next few days by the Great

is rated to reduce a stump every

ment between stumps. The big
auger cuts stump 18. inches in
the ground, leaves a small hole
and the land ready to plow. It
is known as the Moore Rotary
stump Cutter and is owned by a
group of prominent New Orleans
men. Recently a moving pic
ture film of the cutter at work in
the field was exhibited to the of
ficers of the Great Southern
Lumber Company at Bogaluea,
who were so impressed with
what they saw that they at
once entered into an arrange

on their land. If it proves satis

154 Barrels Liquor Spilled
at G(irard On Court's Order
Girard, Abl., Aug. 10.-One
hundred and eight barrells of
beer and forty six barrels of
whiskey belonging to six Girard
residents who recently left the
state to escape prosecution on
charges of prohibition violations,
were destroyed here late today by
Sheriff Richard Lindsey. of Rus
sell county, and his deputies.
The beer and whiskey were pour.
ed into gutters, running into the
Chattahoochie river.
A great crowd, including thous
sands of persons from Columbus,
Ga., across the river, watched the
proceedure. some even taking a
hand in the destruction. A by
stander set fire to a quanty of
whiskey which trickled down the
gutters of the street and the fire
department was called out when
it seemed for a time that the blue
flames would reach the ware
house in which the liquor had
been stored. Otherwise there
was no disorder.
The deputies tired of their task
early tonight and suspended
operations until morning. It is
said that a large quantity re
mains to be destroyed. The en
tire amount to be destroyed un.
der the sheriff is said to be worth
approximately $200,000.
Clears His Name of Charges.
The State-Times wishes to ex
press gratification, as all who are
jealous of the good name of
Louisiana must feel like doing,
that Ex.Gov. Sanders has cleared
himself fully of the charges made
against him with almost convinc
ing sincerity and plausibility by
Mr. Ponder.
Like others we heard with
grave concern made against the
former 'governor of Louisiana;
like others we have waited to
hear the charges refuted, hoping
earnestly and believing sincerely
they would be.
Had some obscure person, or
one whose name had not been
officially linked with the state,
been charged with looting a bank
it would have caused us no anxi
ety, but when the charge was
made against a man who has
occupied the governor's chair we
could not regard it lightly,
Upon any man who has been
honored by the people of a state
with the governorship there rests
thereafter the moral obligation to
the people of that state of keep
ing clear from the name that has
stood at the top of the official
roster for four years. When a
man has thus been closely identi
fied with a state, has been in pop
ular conception the state, itself,
when he is spoken of always as
the ex-governor of that state, his
actions subsequent to retirement
from office do not affect his repu
tation alone. A change made
against a former governor is in
some measure against the state
itself.
For this reason, aside from the
fact that we have enough of the
mill of human kindness in us to
feel pleased when we see any
man defend himself successfully
against attacks upon his integri
ty, we are glad that Mr. Sanders
has explained to the satisfaction
of us all that he is not deserving
of the accusations made against
him by Mr. Ponder.
While we do mot question Mr.
Ponders sincerity in his attack
upon Mr. Sanders, we cannot re
I frain from expressing amazement
that he should launch such an
attack upon such seeming lack
of correct information.

LOUISIANA BOYS
ARE MAKING GOOD
Go Through Their First Teii
Mile Hike Like Season
ed Soldiers.
When an Iliinois regiment took
a practice hike the other day and
most of the men fell by the way
side through fatigue, it was taken
as a commentary on the unpre
paredness of the militia for actual
service. Two weeks later the
same regiment made the same
hike, and redeemed itself, for not
a single man dropped out and the
boys stood the march like sea
soned soldiers. Louisiana has
reason to feel proud for its only
infantry regiment on the border, I
for its first "hike" has establish
ed it as a bunch of seasoned vet
erans. It did almost as well on
its first hike as the Illinois boys a
did on their second.
A personal letter received from
Everette H. Dean, a New Or
leans boy, attached to the ma
chine gun company of the first
Louisiana regiment, tells of the
recent events in camp at San
Benito as follows:
"Bright and early this morning
the Louisiana infantry, headed by
Colonel Stubbs, Lieutenant Col
onel Hodges, and Major Gear,
took a ten-mile hike. Colonel I
Stubbs said it was to toughen us
up. There were over a thousand 1
men in line, and only twenty-five
fell out through fatigue. You
see we have been pretty well
hardened by drilling, digging
trenches and ditches, and other
outdoor work in camp since we
have been on the border, and
were capable of standing the
hardships of the march. The of
ficers were greatly surprised at
the small number who fell out,
because we made a much better
record than some of the other
militia regiments, on their first
hike. It made me feel so good to
be able to stick it out the entire
distance. I had the same feeling
of pride that stirred me that day I
when with my fellow workers of
the Standard Oil -Company, we
marched the route of the Prepar
ednes parade in New Orleans, and
showed the people that we still
loved our country, though we
seemed to have forgotten her dur
ing late years.
"Yesterday evening there was
a regimental parade held by the
Second battilion, and it would
have made any mother's heart
glad to see the manner in which
the boys drilled. There was not
a singlefluke, and every man
looked like a real soldier, Just a
little more of this camp life on the
border, and wewill all be real
soldiers, ready for any call our
country makes on us.
"The machine guns for our
company are due to get here on
August 14, and the boys are
looking forward to the event with
interest. Most of them have
never seen one at close range,
much less handle one, and they
are anxious to begin learning how
to operate this deadly weapon
that seems to be the main reli
ance of the contending armies of
Europe. You know the men of
the machine gun company are
the pick of the regiment (I say
this with btcoming modesty), and
each wants to justify the faith of
his officers, so as soon as the
guns arcready for us, we will
buckle down to practice and stick
to it till we are proficient."
