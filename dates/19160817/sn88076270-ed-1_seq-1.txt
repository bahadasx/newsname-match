NEW CORPORATION TAKES OVER
THE OLD—REMAINS A FARM
ERS' INSTITUTION
At a meeting of the old and new
directors of the co-operative cream
ery, held last Saturday, the business
and legal details of taking over the
affairs of the old corporation by the
new corporation, under a new charter
and a new name, were completed.
The Farmers Co-operative Cream
ery and Produce Company has be
come the Williston Co-operative
Creamery and. Produce Company.
Certain legal exigencies which could
not be fully met by the managers of
the former concern made it necessary,
according1 to the advice of state offi
cials, that the company take out a
new charter and assume a new name.
This was the whole reason for substi
tuting the?' word Williston for the
word Farmers', and the creamery is
no less a farmers' institution than
it was before.
W. W. Keltner, president of the
former company, states that the
creamery is in far better financial
condition than ever in its history.
About $10,000 worth of new stock
has been subscribed by farmers and
Williston business men. This gives
the company ample working capital
and will enable it to take up its out
standing indebtedness and buy the
creamery plant, and the ground it oc
cupies, from E. A. Sharp.
President Keltner, Secretary Eke
berg, and the board of directors of
the old company are entitled to great
credit, according to the opinion of
those familiar with the history of the
creamery, for their tireless and faith
ful efforts during the early struggles
of the company. The creamery has
been made an absolute success and the
foundation of all the difficulties lay
in lack of capital. The capital stock
of the new company is $10,000.
The officers of the newly incorpor
ated company are John Bruegger,
president B. J. Schoregge, treasurer
-A. C. Lowheed, secretary. These
three, together with B. C. Keihl, Geo.
Howard, J. J. Larson and J. L. Smith,
constitute the board of directors. Mr.
Keihl is the only one of the former
directors who would accept re-elec
tion. The creamery is enjoying an
excellent patronage by the farmers
and finds ready market for its pro
ducts at good prices.
H. L. Bolley's Opinions
Concerning: Stem Rust
Rusted grain should be permitted
to ripen normally, the theory that
such grain should be cut early, be
ing unsound, according to H. L. Bol
ley, state pure seed commissioner.
"I have had a number of letters
from farmers asking whether rusty
wheat should be cut early in order
to keep the grain from shriveling,"
"For three years, particularly in
1904, I carried out a number of cut
ting experiments to ascertain wheth
er there is any time previous to ma
turity at .which it is preferable to cut
rusty wheat. These trials, even on
rusty wheat, seem to indicate that it
is preferable to allow the straw to
ripen normally, for rust does not at
tack all of tho plants equally and
those that are not heavily attacked
will ripen some plump seed. If the
grain is cut while there is milk in it,
all of it will be shriveled. Therefore,
it is my opinion that the wheat should
be allowed to stand until by study
of the straw and grain each farmer
is convinced fhat his particular field
is ready to cut. Usually the straw
should be yellow the second joint from
the ""round. When the kernel is
pinched it should emit no moisture or
milk.
"Observations made this year and
past years, convince me that the
barberry bush, commonly planted as
a hedge, should be declared a public
nuisance and be destroyed wherever
possible. This is a great destroyer
of wheat ,as it starts the rust early
in May. .The sexual stage—male and
female form of the wheat rust, is
carried by the Barberry buslu and
seems to serve as a constant reinvig
orator of the Stem or Black Rust.''
Opportunity To Visit
Park Without Cost
Secretary Morrill is in receipt of a
wire from H. A. Noble at Glacier Na
tional park inquiring- if it is possible
to secure any girls from Williston to
act as chambermaids in the Park ho
tels. The terms offered are $30 per
month, board, room and transporta
tion both ways.
Those who have visited the park
and have observed conditions there
sav that many young ladies such as
school teachers, clerks and office girls
avail themselves of this opportunity
for a vacation without cost. The
waitresses and chambermaids are
made up almost entirelv of ^his
of young ladies. The work is said to
be not difficult, and does not require
all of the time of those employed,
there being plenty of time left for
recreation and outines.
Those interested should see Secre
tary Morrill of the Commercial club
at his office in the city building.
STATE EXAMINATION
An Examination for Professional
Certificates will be offered by the
State Board of Education on Aug. 31
and Sept. 1, 1916, at the following
places: Bismarck. Ellendale, Grand
Forks, Rugby, Minot, Valley City

Autos That Pass
In The Evening
When the passing is good, how
many autos ought to pass a given
point on Main street in an hour.
John C. Oveson an employee of
the Hedderich department store
was curious
/to
know the correct
answer.
He supplied himself with a
large board, a supply of pencils
and a comfortable chair in front
of the Hedderich store one even
ing last week.
Down the length ot the board
and back across again— and
again, and ditto—and then some
more round trips—one, two, three,
four, check, marked the counter.
It was just like keeping tally
on a nonpartisan candidate, June
28.
For three hours Mr. Oveson
marked for every car that pass
ed up or down. Then he counted
his marks—There were 579 of
them—193 per hour—3 1-5 per
minute—one every 18 seconds.
Take it the other way and the
total for a business day of twelve
hours is 2316 for one week,
16,912 for thirty days, 69,480
for a year 833,760, and every
one of them drinks gasoline and
honks and lays back its ears at
pedestrains.
If you don't believe that 833,
760 buzz wagons pass through
Main street in one year get a
board and pencil and disprove it.
The revised figures will gladly
be published.
Elks Entertain
State Champions
By way of showing their appre
ciation of the splendid brand of sport
furnished by the Williston base ball
team the present season, the Elks
entertained the members of the team
and the managers at a "Bye Bye Base
Ball Boys Ball" Tuesday evening.
About thirty-five couples enjoyed
adelightful evening at the cozy Elks
home. Onstad's Orchestra furnished
the music, punch was served through
out the evening, and at the stroke of
eleven Exalted Ruler Lavallee called
upon Wm. G. Owens, who gracefully
and pleasantly referred to the pur
pose of the occasion, expressed the
appreciation of the Elks for the good
work of the team, and made severa.
humorous hits at the expense of some
of those prominently connected with
the game.
Clarence Marshall, playing man
ager of the Opportunes, was called
for and in a neat manner expressed
the thanks of himself and team mates
for the kindly appreciation shown by
the Elks.
McKay and Hawley
Take Stable West
The Hawley & McKay racing sta
ble of Williston came in on the Soo
line from Canada, where they have
been entered in many important
events.
The horses left over the Great
Northern today by express on their
way to Montpelier, Idaho, where they
will, race through the inter-mountain
circuit.
The stable consists of nine head of
thoroughbreds, amorr which is the
trood colt, Sir Archibald, the largest
money-winning pacer in western Can
ada this season. Another member, the
little horse Axbybetta, lowered three
track records and holds the Canadian
record. On May 24 he also paced the
fastest mile paced or trotten in Can
ada this season, his record for this
beino- 2.10 1-4. T. A. McKay, the
driver of the string, proved the bisr
best money-getting driver in the Do
minion for 1916. R. F. Hawley and
T. A. McKay are the owners of the
stable and their many friends
throughout the northwest will be
pleased to hear of their splendid suc
cess and will wish them a continua
tion of wins in the inter-mountain
series.—Minot Optic-Reporter**
Electric Chimes
Advertise Bank
The electric chimes and clock sign
just installed for the Williams Coun
ty State bank is a decidedly metro
politan improvement for that section
of the city. A master clock and a
set of batteries, placed inside the
bank, operate the clock and the chimes
that are outside. The pleasing notes
of the chimes not only tell each hour
but mark the succeeding quarters.
Four strokes denote the first quarter,
eight the half hour, twelve the three
quarter hour. Sixteen notes mark
the close of the hour followed by the
number of strokes denoting the hpur.
From 11 P. M. to 7 A. M. the chimes
do not ring.
The clock is of the best construc
tion and the most modern on the mar
ket. It was installed by .E. Shels
trom. representing the manufacturers,
McClintock-Loomis Co., of Minne
apolis.
Pontoon Bridge To
Be Ready For Fair
President Calderwood of the Mis
souri River Bridge Co., states that
rapid progress is being made with
the construction of the bridge. The
timbers that were delayed in transit
have been received and word has come
that the hardware has been shipped.
About two-thirds of the boats are now
completed.
Those in charge of the work are
confident that the bridge can be put
in place and made ready for use be
fore the opening date of the fair. The
low stage of water makes it compara
tivelv easy to bridge the channel
south of
fhe
island and a temporary
road wQl be built over the island and
the flats on the south side.
FIVE RURAL SUNDAY SCHOOLS
JOIN FOR PROGRAM ARRANG
ED BY COUNTY ASS'n.
In spite of the threatening weather
there was a good-sized gathering at
Gromatka's grove last Sunday after
noon to enjoy the fellowship of a pic
nic dinner in the grove and the pro
gram prepared by the County Sunday
School Association for the afternoon.
Five different points were represent-'
ed, .Spring Coulee, Garden Valley,
Missouri Ridge, East Fork and Palm
er school house. A number of people
autoed out from Williston and the
crowd probably numbered about one
hundred and fifty, all told.
After the dinner, which was a most
generous and delicious repast, of
spring chicken and other good things,
the automobiles gathered in a circle
about the organ, which had been loan
ed for the occasion by Mrs. S. M.
Clark, and everybody joined in a song
service. Mr. Harriss, as president of
the County Association, was in
charge of the program, and made the
opening address. Other speakers
were Mr. Goodwin of the Congrega
tional Church, Miss Baldwin, in
charge of the Teacher Training work
for the county, and Miss Palmer, the
very efficient and energetic county
secretary. All emphasized the need
of doing things thoroughly, and of
getting hold of definite and practical
methods of increasing the usefulness
of the rural Sunday schools. The of
fering taken for the county work was
a generous one and covered the entire
amount pledged by the five rural
points at the county convention in
rFhe musical program was unusual
ly good and thoroughly enjoyed. The
numbers consisted of a quartet, a
duet, a solo by Mr. Rhodes and a vio
lin solo by Mr. Onstad. The slight
shower did not seem to dampen any
body's enthusiasm, and the crowd dis
persed with the feeling of having had
a really good time.
Repairs On Top
Walls Of Post Office
The scaffolding on the north side of
the postoffice building means that re*
pairs are being made. In spite of
federal inspectors and the construe*
tion company's superintendents, Jthq
brick used as a backing and filler for
the battlement walls or the part of
the wall projecting above the roof,
was of such inferior quality that the
elements are already causing it to
crumble away after the manner of the
adobe brick used by the natives in the
far southwest.
The briclc used in the backs of
these walls is of a ridiculously rotten
quality, and the word "rotten'' is
used advisedly. Many pieces of the
brick have less strength and tough
ness than a gumbo clod from the road
and can be ground to dust between
the fingers. Although the exposed
surface of the wall was tar coated,
the elements are already causing it to
crumble and fall away.
The Stiles Construction Company of
Chicago, who built the building have
a crew of men here for the purpose of
replacing1 the defective brick.
The Stiles Company state that they
will call upon the Northern Briquet
ting Company, who furnished the
brick to stand the cost of the repairs.
Weather observer Craig, in his
visits to the instruments on the roof,
discovered the condition of the wall
and reported to Postmaster Leon
hardy who reported it to the Treas
ury department.
F!ayed Last Series
At Plentywood
The Williston ball team finished
the season at Plentywood where they
met the Westby team in three excit
ing games. The boys from the state
line put up a, fine article of ball but
the luck seemed to all. break in Wil
liston's favor and all three games
were annexed to the season's string
of victories.
The first game was plaved Satur

and 8 to 1 with Siebert dishing up

•The boys say the trip was one of
the pleasantest of the seison. The
Plentywood team, management and
fans extended them the most cour
teous treatment and are first class
sports and good losers." .The games
were free from the hostilities,
rooting and personal abuse that some
crowds seem to delight in using to
ward a visiting team, especially if the
visitors happen to be the victor? TT°lf
a dozen local fans accompanied the
team and corroborate the story of
the players as to the splendid spirit

THREE GOOD DAYS
FAIR PROGRAM FULL
LARGE ENTRY LISTS ASSURE
GOOD RACES—CLUB EXHIBITS
AND LIVE STOCK
Tho daily programs of events for
the Williams County Fail', which, as
everyone now knows, will be held
Aug. 30, 31 and Sept. 1, are taking
definite shape and promise some of
the best features ever offered.
Secretary Morrill and the directors
are making every effort to make tlv
fair all that it should be in every
respect. The entries for some of the
speed events are unusually numerous.
The 2:18 and 2:25 pacing events seem
to be the favorites. Besides the har
ness horse races there will be run
ning races, farmers' slow race, farm
ers' team race (harnessing, hitching
up and driving around the track1)
pony races, fancy riding contests and
bucking contests.
Large Live Stock Exhibits
The management feels confident
that the entries in the live stock de
partment will be much more numer
ous than at former fairs, although
there have been good exhibits on for
mer years. More good live stock is
raised each year in the county, and
the awakened interest in this depart
ment of agriculture is certain to in
duce farmers to bring in what they
have. The Fair affords a splendid
opportunity for a farmer to learn
what his neighbor is doing with horses
or cattle or hogs, and to show what
he is doing himself. There is an
abundance of live stock within an
easy radius around Williston worthv
of exhibit, and every pen and stall
should be filled during the Fair.
Farmers Club Exhibits
Much interest is shown by the
members of numerous farmers clubs
in the farm club competition. Some
of the finest collective club exhibits
ever gotten together are certain to
be found in the agricultural building.
Some of the clubs which in the past
have not before competed, or have not
suceeded in landing one of the best
prizes, are going into the competition
this year with firm determination to
win.
Secretary Morrill has found a brisk
demand for refreshment and amuse
ment concessions and has sold a large
amount of space at an advance rate
over other years.
Last Game
Of The Season,
Benefit Co. E
Another last ball game is booked
for Friday evening at 6:30. No for
eign baseball foe will strive to wrest
honors from our now famous team,
but a game between two home aggi*e
gations will furnish entertainment for
those who patronize the game.
Friends of Company E desire to im
prove the opportunity that exists
this week to swell the Company fund.
The boys have been poorly provided
for so far, and have as yet received
no pay. It is a matter of real duty
to keep some money in the company
fund. Every company in the regi
ment was provided with a larger
fund than Company E. All money
received for the Friday evening bene
fit game will be placed to the credit
of the company fund which is kept
in a local bank.
Mutt and Jeff
The opposing teams will be cap
tained by "Mutt" and "Jeff"—the real
characters in the flesh. The plan for
a benefit game being a newspaper
idea the teams will be designated as
The Heralds and The Graphics. Each
team will have a nucleus of players
from the Opportunes surrounded and
"supported'' by an assortment of erst
while stars who will have the oppor
tunity of their lives to show how the
national game should be played and
to "show up" the weak spots in the
playing of the regulars.
Positively this will be a "good"
game and you simply must not miss
it. The management is in search of
high class talent for umpires. Such
will be needed as the fine points of
the playing will require careful judg
ment.
Buy a ticket—25 cents or as much
as you wish to pay— the money all
goes to make our soldier boys on the
border comfortable. Remember the
time—Friday evening, the 18th at
6:30.

The Man, the Monkey
And the Gentle Art
Not so very much is required

mind
Of course that is not news but
it is philosophy.
Besides an oilchith covered
handorgan, which he never for

from Italy's sunnv H^k's a
monkey on a string—a very small
monkt'y, dress wl liiio so''.tier.
And such a serious monkey—the
wisdom of the ages and the cares
of the whole monkey tribe were
his, or hers, as the case may be.

a small excitable dog was put

little traveler—and there were
other ways and thev nil tickled
the crowd in the right spot and

Cando Too Stro^
For the Minot Team
Local baseball fans will be inter
ested to learn the result of the series
between Cando and Minot on accpunt
of the great interest in the Cahdo
Willistoil series.
First game—Minot 5, Cando 2 sec
ond—Minot 0, Cando 6 third—Mi
not 1, Cando 8 fourth—Minot 1, Can
do (5 fifth—Minot 1, Cando 1, thirteen
innings, called.
The memory of eleven straight
losses to Williston still rankles in Mi
not's breast. In writing up the first
game, in which they bested Cando, the
Optic-Reporter had a brief return of
confidence, saying among other things:
"The Cando bunch, reinforced by
Hinbury, the Williston third sacker,
opened up against the Magicians last
night. Local fans are wishing that it
might have been the whole Williston
team, for despite the many defeats
administered to them by the Oppor
tunes the present outfit are aching to
take another crack at the lads from
the city west of here."
Now the joke is that in this same
game, said Himbury made two of the
four hits secured by Cando and both
of their runs, so if it had been "the
whole Williston team" it is easy to
calculate where the Maericians would
have gotten off at. At the end of the
series the reporter commented on the
strength of the Cando team and just
could not refrain from handing us
another slam by remarking that they
looked better than the Opportunes.
Hit By Auto
In Public Road
While walking in the broad highway
near the Experimental Farm with a
companion Monday evening John Abel
a young man employed at the Model
Cafe, was run over by an automobile
and severely though not seriously in

was going south.
According to the testimony given
at the hearing, held before Justice
Smith at the court house Wednesday,
the car which was driven by Ray
Eddy, a salesman for the American
Tobacco Company, was steering an
uncertain course and going at consid
erable speed. The witnesses stated
that there were two wa»on trails at
the point where the accident occurred
and that they got well to the ricrht
of the right hand trail. They say
that the car turned diroctlv tow*- '1
them and one jumped to the right
and the other to the left, but Abel
could not avoid the car and was
struck* and thrown violently to the
ground.
Abel caused the arrest of Eddy who
was bound over to the district court.

EMPLOYMENT FOR BOYS AND
GIRLS —/IMPORTANT THAT
PUPILS START FIRST DAY
After the summer recess, the city
schools renew their work at the usual
date of opening,—the day following
a a
While the new building is not yet
ready for occupancy, other arrange
ments have been made which will be
entirely adequate for the immediate
needs of the schools.
There is need as always for homes
in which high school boys and girls
can secure work to meet their board
and room expenses. The demand for
high school girls has exceeded thair
number and those homes desiring
these young ladies will do well to
place their names and address with
the superintendent early.
During the past year some diffi
culty was encountered in finding suffi
cient opportunities for the young men
of the high school who desired places
to work. Several deserving boys had
to leave school because work could
not be found. It is hoped that this
notice will interest many who will co
operate with the school in helping
these young men who are willing to
work well, in order to maintain them
selves at school.
As heretofore, first grade children
should enter school like all others on
the first day of school. Any child who
is six years of age, or who will be
six on or before the first of January
may enter school on September 5th.
It will not be possible to enter first
grade pupils at a later date except
under unusual circumstances. No
first grade pupils enter in January.
It is imperative throughout all de
partments and schools of the system
that every pupil be in his place from
the opening date. A tardy start
means retarded work, if not failure.
Two years ago two additional first
grades \vere added last year two ad
ditional second grades were needed,
and this year two more third grades
are being provided for.
As heretofore the "Boundary Line"
is First Avenue west. Pupils whose
homes are directly upon the Avenue,
either side, attend Central school, ex
cept in those grades for- which there
are two grades in each building, and
the Junior High school, and the Senior
High school.
St. Paul Tourists
Enjoyed Their Trip
In a letter to the Graphic the party
of St. Paul trade representatives who
spent an hour in Williston the morn
ing of July 29 extend the following
message of appreciation and felicita
tion to the community:
"The St. Paul party of Wholesale
Merchants, Manufacturers and Bank
ers which toured Montana and a por
tion of North Dakota for two weeka.
July 16th to 30th, inclusive, returned
home with most enthusiastic feelings
over the country they had seen, the
people they had met, and the cordial
receptions tendered them every
where. .,,
"Since it is quite impossible to
thank individually all of# tho v'io
assisted in making our visit to your
city pleasant and profitable, I am di
rected to express to you, and through
you to your people, the thorough ap
preciation of all the members of our
party for their very cordial welcome.
We 'shall all feel a little better ac
quainted with and a great deal more
interest in your city because of our
visit.
"Trips such as ours, although un
dertaken primarily in the hope of es
tablishing closer business relations,
serve a much higher and mn-c
ful purpose. In addition to correct
ing erroneous impressions frequent
ly entertained concerning th« re
sources and advantages of different
localities, they emphasize the com
plete inter-dependence of Citv
Country,—the necessity for a better
understanging between them, and
closer co-operation in all things per
taining to the common welfare. No
one can make such a tour as
without being profoundly impressed
with the magnificient resources and
great prosperity of the territory
traversed, and the splepdid future in
store for it."
Engineer Meets
Death On Engine
William B. McGrath, an engineer
for the Great Northern, met a sad
den death while driving his engine
near Poplar, Montana, at about 9 A.
M., western time, Tuesday.
Mr. McGrath was called out for
the run at 2 A. M., and the news of
his violent death was a heavy shock
to his wife and friends. Th»
manner of death is not known, but tho
fact that a bridge had just been pass
ed and that the wound that caused
the death was on his head makes
plausible the theory that he was
leaning out of his engine to oil a cer
tain part that had been giving trouble
and that he was struck by some part
of the bridge. The fireman missed
the engineer and, after he had stop
ped the train, discovered Mr. Mc
Grath's body at the side of the track.
The remains were brought to Wil
liston and it is probable that services
will be held tomorrow but arrange
ments
have not yet been completed.^
The deceased, who resided at 70S
1st Avenue West, leaves a wife and
two children. He belonged to the
Elks and the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers.
