WITH PET BILL
Oklahoma Senator Fights
to Have Corrupt Practice
Kill Voted on.
REPUBLICANS WANT
IT SHOVED ASIDE
.Administration Men Can't
(Jet Robert L. to Agree
to Compromise.
WASHINGTON, Aug. Repub
lican senate leaders and Scna
tor Dwhi, Democrat, tied llio legislu-tv-
situatinn in the senate Into a
haul knot today, threatening the
plans of administration leaders to ex
pedite the shipping, workmen's com
pensation and revenue Mils and as
sure an early adjournment of con
gress. The obstacle Interposed was the
Owen corrupt practices bill to limit
and regulate political campaign con
tributions. The Democrats did not
include the measure ill their legisla
tive program, but Senator Owen wants
it passed and the Republican leaders
want definite assurances of Us post
ponement until the December session.
W hen Senator Fletcher sought an
agreement to vote on the shipping bill
late today. Republican leaders de
manded in return a promise from the
administration forces that the cor
rupt prirctices bill would not be
pressed to a vote before adjournment.
Most of the Democrats were willing
to give such a promise Inasmuch as
the bill was not In the Imperative pro
gram. They found Senator Owen,
however, determined to call his bill
up somo time beforo adjournment
and to demand a vote on It no matter
what the result might bo.
Knd in Tangle.
Senator Owen's attitude resulted in
a declaration by the Hepublicans that
they would not agree to any unani
mous consent requests to fix a time
for voting on either the shipping or
revenue hills. Senator Owen there
upon announced he also would refuse
unanimous consent on request to fix
a time to vote on the other bills as
long as opposition to taking up his
messure persisted.
That was the tangled situation when
the senate adjourned tonight without
a vote on tho shipping bill. Some ad
ministration leaders thought Presi
dent Wilson might have to be ap
pealed to If the way were to be
cleared for the shipping, revenue and
workmen's compensation bills which
would complete the legislative pro
gram. If Senator Owen and Republi
can leaders remain determined, it
was declared, congress may bo held
In session indefinitely. Tho revenue
hill was reported from the flnanco
committee today, but the present plan
Is to pass both the shipping and work
men's compensation bills before It Is
taken up.

KNID, Okla., Aug. 18. A move
ment to oust Mayor John Clover and
Commissioner Fred Mct'lane was
started hero today when petitions
containing the signatures of more
than 1,200 .citizens were filed with
the city clerk. Misconduct in office
is charged. The proceedings had
been contemplated for some time, it
is said, but not until today it became
apparent those who have tired of tho
administration had decided upon
drastic action against the officials
named. It is said to be tho intention
of taking similar steps against ottiers
of the city's official family.
The charges against the mayor and
Commissioner Met Mane are based on
affidavits sworn to by Harry tjlasser,
former county attorney, who recently
was dismissed from office. Mo
charges that city employes long had
been in the habit of drinking all
liquors confiscated in raids, and that
such misconduct was with tho full
knowledge and sanction of the mayor
ami Mct'lane.
The city clerk will require ten days
to examine the petitions to ascertain
whether they are regular and contain
the number of names necessary to be
gin such a proceeding.

The landsthing, tho upper house of

a committee of the whole to consider
the treaty providing for the sale of

States, and 47 of tho 61 members
present placed themselves In favor of
the order of the day stating that the
sale can not be settled before elec

have been held.
The situation has been further com.
plicated by a proposal from Premier
Zahle that the government resign and
help in the formation of a cabinet
representing the various parties. This
proposal, if carried out, would avoid
the holding of elections as advocated
Success Is certain as the Socialists
have hitherto declined to be represen

the other party.
Nothing can be settled at present
as many members of the folkcthlng
are not In town.
An influential member of the radi

the government offer to resign did
not mean that it feared the result of
an election, but that if elections were

branded as a traitor to his country the
man who sought to Imilii up Ins pri

"The man who tries to get the bet

to the government. We will go ahead
and put these traitors out of business
while vc buiiil up the business of the

"For the present I am spokesman
of that organization," he continued.
"It was not eer thus."
In spc:iking of preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said:
"It desire to see Ihe United States
holding its head erect among tint peo

Creation of Commission to
Investigate Situation Ts
Proposed.

of the managers and employes to

ficials said negotiations would be con
tinued until a peaceful solution was
found, the outcome of the president's

up.

president after conferences with tho
managers and employes since Monday
morning .proposes that the railways

day with an agreement that It will
bo observed. Uiter it probably will
be propoicd that a federal commis
sion appointed by the president or
created by congress, Investigate all
problems vvhiih have arisen during
the pres. tit discussion.
The chief obstacles in the way of
ncceptaneu of the plan lies In tho
It sistence of the railroad managers on
arbitration and their opposition to
the eight -hour day and the dt mand
f r time and hulf for overtime.
Whether the two sides will give in
on there points constituted the chief
danger In the situation tonight.

ployes. Including 610 representatives
of the trainmen und englnemen on
the 2i.'5 railroad systems of tho coun
try, arrived here tonight in response
to u summons by their subcommittee
which has been meeting with the
president. The general committee
bus plenary powers to accept or re
ject unv suggestion. '
