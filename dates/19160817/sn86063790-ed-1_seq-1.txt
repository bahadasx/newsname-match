JAMES WHITCOMB RILE>\
Sketcli of Famous Bard of Indiana
Who Has Passed Away. '
The following is a sketch of James
Whitcomb Riley, the famous Hoosier
poet who died recently at his home
in Indianapolis. M?. Riley was the
author of "That Old Sweetheart of
Mine" and scores of other songs and
poems that are famous all over the
United States:
James Whitcomb Riley, bard ot
the middle west, sang the joys, sorrows,
fancies and humors of its folk,
largely in its own dialect. The world
was so touched by his inspiration and
the realism of his homely symbols
that he was one of the few, that, demoting
their lives to poetry, gained
a fortune.
Mr. Riley was peculiarly sensitive
as to the advance of age and evaded
inquiries as to the date of his birth
but the most accurate information
available indicates that he was born
in 1848.
"Should you ask his age," one of
his friends said, "he would answei
'This side of 40,' and leave you to
guess which side."
The poet was the son of Reuben A.
Riley, a lawyer and political speaker
of Greenfield, Ind. The boy could
not be brought to the dull routine of
i school days, but he was wise in the
lore of streams and fields. His mother,
who was Elizabeth Marine before
her marriage, was a writer of verse
and Riley in latter life attributed
some of his impracticability to her.
Instead of preparing for the practice
of law, as his father wished, the
son turned itinerant sign painter.
For ten years he roved through the
Ohio valley, painting signs on fences.
He had the trick of the brush and
pencil and clearly drew sketches illustrating
the virtues of merchandise.
He was naturally musical and
shone as a fiddler in the villages at
which his party stopped at night.
TT -1 J i? J 3 ^ X _
.tie piayea ior aances anu ac i-uucerts
in country hotels. He wrote
rhymes, which sometimes found their
way into country newspapers.
The total income of the people of
the United States is about $35,000,000,000
a year. Of this, $10,000^
000,000 is derived from agricultural
products, $2,500,000,000 from minerals,
and $10,000,000,000 from
manufactured articles.
Now is a good time to use the 'split
log drag.
Friday, and the second regiment
reached the same destination Sunday.
The men were reported to be in fine
health, and they stood the long trip
well. The two regiments were accorded
a royal welcome by the towns
along the route to Texas.
The body of a baby boy between
one and two months old was found in
an old valise near Chauga, Oconee
county, last week. It is believed that
the baby was thrown from a passing
railway train. For a long distance
along the railway child's clothing
was found scattered. No clue as to
the murderer has been found.
Last Friday special whiskey constables
in Charleston confiscated 107
barrels of beer and 15 barrels of
whiskey on a side track just outside
of Charleston city. The shipment
was consigned to an unknown party,
and was put on the siding by permission
as a carload of bricks, it is
said. No arrests have been made.
Mistaken for a burglar, Roy
Smith, 8-year-old son of Sam Smith,
of Greenville, was shot and instantly
killed by John Sullivan, his brotherin-law
Saturday. The boy was spending
the night with Sullivan. During
the night Sullivan heard a noise at
the back door, and seeing a shadow,
thought it a burglar and fired, and
was horrified to find that it was his
brother-in-law whom he had mistaken
for a burglar.

THE COUNTY CAMPAIGN IS FORMALLY
OPENED.
Meeting Was Devoid of Enthusiasm
or Sensation.?All Candidates
Given Careful Hearing.
The county campaign was formally
opened last Thursday "at Ehrhardt.
A crowd of about 250 heard the candidates
for the various county offices,
each candidate being given 'a
careful and respectful hearing. The
meeting was absolutely devoid of
anything that could be construed as
enthusiasm; no unpleasant personalities
were indulged in. The meeting
was especially conspicuous for
the absence of practically all applause.
A few half-heartedv handclaps
marked the close of nearly all
speeches, but no candidate was cheered.
The meeting was held in a grove
on Main street, and was called to order
by Mr. D. P. Smith, who presided
and introduced the speakers. The
speaking began at 11:30 and lasted
until nearly three o'clock, by which
tme a good many of the crowd had
left, and the balance was tired and
hungry.
In calling the meeting to order
Chairman Smith requested that every
Democrat present give the sum
of one dollar for the Democratic
national campaign fund. He praised
the administration of Woodrow Wilson,
and called on the Democrats to
stand by the party and help reelect
Wilson.
Cotton Weigher.
The first candidates introduced
were those who offer for cotton
weigher at Ehrhardt, Boyce W.
Bishop being the first to speak. Mr.
Bishop promised, if elected, to give
everybody a fair deal. He said he
would provide good scales and hooks
to handle the cotton with.
B. C. Hiers was next called, but
was not present.
D. F. McMillan, Jr., was next introduced.
The place he wants, he
said, is not one for words, but of
work, and he has "no better sense
than to do it." He said the people
are well acquainted with him, and if
they elect him cotton weigher he
promised to attend strictly to the
business.
Magistrate.
J. H. Kinard, candidate for reelection
as magistrate at Ehrhardt,
promised, if reelected, to continue' to
do his duty as he has done in the
past. He thanked the voters for
electing him two years ago.
J. C. Copeland said he had served
as magistrate once before, and he believed
that he would serve again. If
the office is not worth asking f9r it
is not worth having?and he is asking
for it.
J. A. Johns promised, if the people
will elect him as magistrate, that he
will do his full duty.
Coroner.
J. H. Zeigler, candidate without
opposition for reelection, as coroner,
thanked the voters for past favors.
He has tried to do his duty, and will
continue to do so?and he can
promise no more.
County Commissioner.
W. D. Bessinger was the first candidate
introduced for county commissioner.
He offers for reelection
as commissioner of the upper district,
and has no opposition. He
thanked the voters for their support
in the past. He said he did the best
he knew how, and promised to contimina.
fn Hr* cn in thf* flltlirp.
A. G. W. Hill is a candidate for
reelection for commissioner from the
lower district. He feels that he has
done his duty. He had no help from
the chain gang, but he did the best
for his section that he could with
the commutation road tax. He used
the money to the best advantage,
and built some new roads. He gave
a detailed statement of the receipts
and disbursements for the several
townships. He has nothing to say
against his opponents, and said if he
is reelected he will not offer for
election again.
Otis L. Copeland promised, if
elected, to give his time and services
in keeping the roads in good condition
and carrying on the work of the
office.
W. W. Steedlv is running on his
own merits. He stands upon the
platform of letting all work out by
contract to the lowest bidder, and
would let this rule apply to all materials
and supplies as well as road
work. He stands also for economy,
good roads and bridges. He was
raised on the farm and is used to
hard work.
Joe W. Zeigler has no record as
COUPLE WAKED BY LIGHTNING.
Strange Antics of the Bolt That Entered
Their Bed Room.
News of the strange antics played
by a bolt of lightning that invaded
a home of this city has just come to
light about town, and as recounted is
probably the most singular incident
of its kind Anderson has ever known.
During the height of the rain and
thunder storm that passed over this
city Sunday night, Mr. and Mrs. P.
A. Dobbs, 26 Lyon street, Orr mill,
were rudely awakened shortly after
1 o'clock by a shock that almost hurled
them both from bed.
Standing in the middle of the
room, stunned and almost incoherent
from fright or amazement, the
Dobbes slowly took in the results of
the lightning's visitation. A circular
hole was seen in the door, and near
' i
the bed lay an object but little larger
than a piece of kindling wood. The
lightning, it seems, had entered the
house through the door and passed '
through the Wooden bed post, neatly
chiseling out a piece of wood from v
the centre of the post and leaving a
v , r-L
surprisingly smooth hole, almost /
large enough to pass one's hand
through. The post stood squarely ?
under the bed, none the worst for
the blow, it received, except for the
f
portion slashed from its centre.
The lightning's exit from the home
could not be located. Scores of people
visited the Dobbs home during
Monday to view the strange sight.
Other than being stunned and badly
shaken, Mr. and Mrs. Dobbs were
none the worse for the experience.?
The Intelligencer.
county commissioner, but referred
the people to his previous record as
masgistrate. He does noi promise
anything, but will hew to the line
and let the chips wall where they
will.
Supervisor and Treasurer.
L. P. McMillan, candidate for reelection
as supervisor, without opj
_ ,..5?
position, was next called, but was
not present. A letter from him was
read thanking the voters for their
support two years ago.
G. A. Jennings, candidate for re- ^
election as treasurer, without opposition,
thanked the voters for past
favors. He promised to continue to
do his duty. He said he tried to
have as few tax executions as possible,
and if anybody had executions
issued against them, it was not his
fault.
Auditor and Supt. Education.
R. W. D. Rowell; for reelection as
auditor and superintendent of education,
was next called. He wras not "V
present, but sent a letter, wrhich was <
read. He thanked the people for
their vote in the past, and asked for
reelection. He was detained on account
of ill health.
G. W. Folk said he has a lot of
friends at Ehrhardt. If elected he
promised to fill the office and do his
full duty. He regretted that there
are so many people in the county
who cannot sign their names on the
club rolls.
E. L. Price was next introduced.
He needed no introduction to most
of the people. He is a graduate of
the Citadel, having been the 26th in
a class of 53. He has been a bookkeeper
most of the time, and feels
that he is well qualified to fill the
office, which he considers one of the
most important in the county. He
had nothing to say against any of his
opponents, but he hopes that the vosters
would look at the matter from a
business standpoint.
She^ff.
S. G. Ray, candidate for reelection
as sheriff, said that he had had a
trying time since January first, but
that he had succeeded well in the
enforcement of the prohibition law.
He considered that Bamberg city is

blind tigers, but with the able support
of the citizens' vigilance committee,
the situation is well under
control, and almost all of the illicit
sale of whiskev had been wiped out.

He promised to continue to enforce
the laws. He read a report of the
State board of charities and corrections
commending the excellent condition
ip. which the jail is kept. He
will appreciate the votes of the peo-?
pie' if he merits reelection. .
D. J. Delk has lived in the county
all his life, and has contributed
of his means to schools, churches and
other worthy objects. He said he
had always been identified with movements
for the betterment of the people.
He declared conditions in the
county had improved, but there was
