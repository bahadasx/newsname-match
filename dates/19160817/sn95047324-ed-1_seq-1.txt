MYSTERIOUS
AEROPLANE
Passed Over Punta Gorda Early
Sunday Morning
WAS GOING TOWARD TAMPA
Observed by Town Marshall J. H.
Lipscomb and Constable Leslie
Lewis Was Seen also by Peo
ple at Tarpon Springs
About 1 o'clock, Sunday morn
ing, Town Morshal J. II. Lips
comb and Leslie Lewis were com
ing to town in an auto and, when
within a mile of Aclino, a large
air-ship flying about a mile high
and heading in the direction of
Tampa, passed to the westward of
them. It was showing two big,
bright lights and theh engine oc
casionally emitted sparks. It kept
an even keel and flew in a direct
course.
The noise made by ther auto
prevented the gentlemen from
hearing the buzzing of the. , air
ship's propeller. This is all the
account they could give of the
mysterious object, which they are
sure was an aeroplane of some
kind. It could not possibly, they
say. have been a meteor, ignis
fatuus or a balloon set free with
' lights attached to it.
w P. S.. Since the above was in
' yppi The Herald's scientist has
come to the conclusion that the
supposed air-ship was merely the
. -reflection in a lunar mirage of the
." gentlemen's auto. The moon was
shining brightly and it could,
here fore, easily reflect the
f lights of the fluto on the mists a
f'f rsing from the bay. Atmospheric
. ' conditions were just right for
such a phenomenon.
Wonderful mirages have been
seen here in the day time, and it
,''V should not be doubted that they
are sometimes created by the re
'fleeted and refracted rays of tbo'
nioon.
i i : jtfAnother P. S. Capt. Lipscomb
ywists that it could not possibly
,ave been a mirage, because the
?tr-ship passed directly across the
'path' of his auto, and he was able
to see the great bulk of the plane
as it passed. That he was not de
ceived, that it was really an air
ship of some kind, is now confirm
ed by people who saw it passing
over Tarpon Springs about an
hour after it left this locality.
The following is the report from
Tarpon Springs, which is taken
from the Tampa Times of Tues
day evening:
Tarpon Springs, Aug. 15. J. A.
Whitehurst, night marshal here;
Lewis Gaines, assistant night mar
shal, and others, saw an aeroplane
over Tarpon Springs between 2
and 3 o'clock Sunday morning.
The machine was distinctly seen,
Hying sufficiently low so the ex
haust of the engine could be heard,
though it was not near enough
for the men on the ground to de
cide what type of machine it was.
They were first attracted by the
sound of an engine apparently a
liove their heads, and then as the
machine approached made out the
location of the machine. Once
found, it was casHy visible, and
then suddenly the beam of a high
powered searchlight appeared.
The light, switched on, played on
houses' and other objects about
Tarpon Springs as the machine
kept on its course in the general
direction fo Tampa.
In addition to Whitehurst and
(iaines, officers who were on duty
at the time, a number whose atten
tion was called joined the group
in watching the arcoplane until
it passed from sight. Among those
who declared they had seen the
aeroplane today were George Har
shaw and Claude Barnhill, both of
this city.
Losses Through Lack of Birds
Scientists have determined by
careful computation, study and
investigation that the farmers and
fruit growers over this country
are losing over $1,000,000,000 a
v-'ar by reason of the reckless and
senseless destruction of birds dur
ing the past thirty years, says Col
onel G. O. Shields.
The cotton growers of the south
are suffering a loss of $100,000,-
000 a year by reason of ravages of
the boll weevil, an insect that
bores into the cotton boll and kills
it, Whyf Because the quails,
prairie chickens, meadow larks
and other birds, which were for
merly there in millions, have been
swept away by thoughtless men
and boys. ,
The grain growers are losing
over $1,000,000,000 a year on ac
count of the work of the chinch
bug. They arc losing another
$2200,000,000 on account of the
work of the Hessian fly. Both of
these are very small insects, al
most microscopic in size. It takes
24,000 chinch bugs to weigh an
ounce, and nearly 50,000 Hessian
flies to weigh an ounce.
Scientific men announce that
there is no way on earth by which
these insects can be destroyed ex
cept for the people to stop the
killing of the birds, absolutely and
at all times, and let them come
back and take care of the insects.
Our Dumb Animals. '
Now a Money Crop
Black-eyed peas may now be
considered one of the "money
crops" of Florida. About a year
ago the Jacksonville Wholesale
Grocers Association became arous
ed on the subject of the large
sums, $5 00,000 to $1,000,000,
which annually were sent out of
the state for that nutritious article
of diet. That body proceed to
investigate. The attention of the
Times-Union was drawn to the
subject of this economic waste
and on the last Sunday in August
an article appeared in our local
columns which gave the contents
of a letter from an expert of the
national agriculture department
telling how the Florida black-eyed
pea may be saved from the rav
ages of the weevil which render
ed the Florida product commerci
ally worthless.
Now we learn that the associa
tion took steps to increase the sup
ply from this state and to put in
to effect this expert's advice. The
result is that the crop of this stato,
duly kiln-dried at a degree of heat
that kills the weevil and its eggs
but low enough to leave the germ
of the pea unharmed, is passing
hit- '--state commerce. This
was successfully done at a kiln
established at Gainesville for the
purpose. I he process made them
as fit for storage as the Califor
nia product, which is standard.
To increase the supply the Jack
sonville Wholesale Grocers Asso
ciation has furnished with seed all
Florida farmers who would agree
to raise the black-eyed peas, prom
ising to buy the entire crop at a
minimum price of $2.50; or pay the
market price should it go above
that, figure. The price did go a
bovo that minimum by 25 cents
and the members of the associa
tion kept their word by paying
$2.85 per bushel.
Tli us the wholesale grocers arc
cooperating disinterestedly with
the farmers of Florida in produc
ing a crop which is said to be
rather superior in quality to that
of California. It is a crop, too,
which responds generously to
proper cultivation in both amount
and quality. There is no other
edible legume which quite equals
it in the amount of both nrotein
and carbohydrates it contains, un
less it be the soy bean so popular
in Asiatic countries. The popu
larity in the Southeast of this
American product is shown by
the fact that in some seven years
ago the price had risen from one
dollar below to one dollar above
the price per bag for Lima beans
or pea iVans.
There is nothing of profit to the
wholesale grocer in preferring to
deal in the Florida rather than in
tho -ilfornia product. It is an
evidence of their interest in con
serving and developing the re
sources of Florida. Florida

"Three cheers for the motor
car," says an Oklahoma paper,
which also adds: "And three
cheers, along with the others, for
the faithful horse, upon whom so
many of us find ourselves so large
ly depending."
It's all up with an aviator when
he tumbles down.

Such hay must first of all be true

Berlin says that south of Brody

Russian attacks were put down
with heavy losses, and that Rus

were driven out and 300 of them
