Two shots were fired througlyhis
open bedroom window, piercingfthe

Winnebago Chieftain: Wm. Best.
of Dakota City helped us celebrate
Thursday.... M rs. C. B. Betts and
children motored to Crystal lake in
A. M. Smith's new Ford Wednesday
. . .Several Winnebagoites have been
camping at Crystal lake this week,
among whom were Mrs. Emory anil
children, Mrs. Dr. Johnson and child
ren, Mr. and Mrs. Jensen, Mr. and
Mrs. lirassheld . . . . With this issue
we surrender possession of the
Chieftain plant to R. J. Taylor of
Emerson. We wish Mr. Taylor all
the success possible in his field
In our last week's issue we spoke of
a rumor concerning the sale of the
Chieftain and said further that we
knew nothing of such a sale. We
knew nothing of it until after the
sale had been made and possession
demanded. In leaving the Chieftain
office we have nothing to say except
just this. We built up the subscrip
tion list of the paper and we expect
to retain it. Next week we will
send to our subscribers the new
Winnebago Journal and ask your
support. We are not going to pub
lish a paper because of any hard
feeling against the future editor of
the Chieftain but because of circum
stances over which he had no con
trol. He had a perfect right to pur
chase the Chieftain and the selling
agents had a perfect right to sell
but the peculiar part comes in the
fact that the sale was not made thru
the authorized agents of the pro
prietors. This and reasons that
most people in Winnebago know
cause us what seems to be a necess
ary step.

Wigle died at the home of his sister
Mrs. John Watson, last Saturday,
Aug. 5, at the age of 59 years. He
was born at Dakota City, Nebr., and
is said to be the first white child
born in that county. Soon after he
became of age Mr. Wigle took up a
homestead northeast of Emerson
and lived thereon until 1897 since
which time he has made his home
with his sister. For eighteen monthB
he has been an invalid under the care
of a trained nurse most of the time.
During all this time he has been a
constant although patient sufferer
and has realized for some time that
he could never be well again. Be
sides his sister, Mrs. John Watson,
he leaves a brother, Jason; a niece,
Georgia Church of Van Tassel, Wyo
ming; and a nephew, Jesse Campbell
of Minnesota. Mr. Wigle( was a
perronal friend of Rev. Drulinger, a
formerly pastor of the Methodist
church of this place but now of
Plattamouth, Nebr., and it was the
request of Mr. Wigle that Rev.
Drulinger be secured to conduct the
funeral services. Mr. Drulinger ar
rived Monday night and services
were held from the Presbyterian
church Tuesday afternoon, interment
in the Hose Hill Cemetery. The de
ceased will be remembered as one of
Nebraska's pioneers and one of her
most likable citizens.
Roosevelt Applauds
Hughes' Speech
Theodore Roosovolt eat In a box at
Carneglo Hall whoa Mr. Hughes do
llvorcd his speech of acceptanco and
vigorously applauded every tolling
point.
Tho Colonel repeatedly aroso and
bowed In response to tho choors for
him and tho shouts of "Toddy 1" "Ted
dy I" "Hurrah for Teddy 1", and when
the ineotlng adjourned ho inado the
following statement:
"It Is an admlrablo apoech and I
wish to call attention to tho following
points:
"I am particularly pleased with tho
exposure of tho tolly, and worse than
folly, of Mr. "WlUon'a Mexican policy
and of tho way In which tills policy
has brought humiliation to tho United
States and disaster to Mexico itself.
"Moreover, I am very glad of the
ctratp-ht forward manner In which Mr.
Hi:f!ui has shown tho rtdlculo with
wu.ri. Mr. Wilson has covered this na
ttou U) tho mannor In which ho al
lowed foreign powers to gain the lm
prosslon that although ho used the
strongest words in diplomacy thoy
were not to bo taken seriously.
Not Words Which Count.
"Aa Mr. Hughos sold, it Is not words
but tho strength and resolution bohlnd
tho words which count Ab Mr.
Hughes pointed out, there Is no doubt
that if Mr. Wilson's conduct and ac
tion had been such as to mako the
foreign nations hellevo that ho meant
precisely what ho said In his 'strict
accountability' thoro would have been
no destruction of American Uvos by
the sinking of tho Lusltanla.
"When Mr. Hughos uses strong
words his record shows that they aro
always backed by strong deeds, and
thoroforo In tho enormous majority of
cases the uso of strong words renders
It unnecessary ever to havo recourso
to strong deeds.
"Again, Mr. Hughes speaks In char
acteristically straightforward fash
Ion of tho outragos committed on mu
nitions plants, and all men, whether
citizens of forolgn nations or nominal
citizens of our own land, who had in
any shape or way abetted or condoned
thoBp actions can understand that Mr.
Hughos, If Prcsldont, will protect
those domestic American interests and
punish offenders against them with
tho fearlossnoss and thoroughness
that ho showed in doallng with tho
powers of evil at Albany.
Brought Nation to Ignominy.
"Just beforo coming In to listen to
Mr. Hughes' Just characterization of
Mr. Wilson's falluro to protect tho
Uvea and property of Americans In
Mexico and on tho high seas, I hap
pened to pick up John Piske's "Critical
Period of American History," and was
struck by tho following two sentences:
" 'A government touches tho lowest
point of Ignominy when it confossoa
Its Inability to protoct tho lives and
tho property of Ita citizens. A gov
ernment which has come to thlB has
failed in discharging tho primary func
tion ot eovornment and forthwith
teases to havo any reason for exist'
Ingi,
"Mr. Hughes has pointed out in his
speech with eolf-restralnt, but with
emphasis, that dt Ib precisely this
primary function which Mr. Wilson's
Administration has failod to discharge
and that it is proclsoly this point ot
Ignominy to which ho lias reduced
tho nation ovor which ho Is ITeal-dent,"
;333?)s8aa)smosmGm
A POLICY OF FIRMNESS AND
CONSISTENCY NEEDED.
The Nation ha,s no policy of
aggression toward Moxlco. "Wo
liavo no deslro for any part ot
hor territory. Wo wish hor to
havo peace, stability, and pros
perity. Wo shall havo to adopt
a now policy, a policy of firm
ness and consistency through
which alono v. can promote an
enduring friendship. Wo do
mand from Mexico tho protec
tion of tho Uvos and tho prop
erty of our citizens and tho se
curity of our border from doprc
datlons. Much will bo gained
if Moxlco is convinced that wo
contemplato no moddlcsomo In
terference with what does not
concorn us, but that wo proposo
to insist in a firm and candid
manner upon tho performance
of international obligations. To
a otablo government, appropri
ately discharging 1U interna
tional duties, we ehould give un
grudging support A short peri
od of firm, consistent and
friendly dealing will accomplish
moro than many year sf vacll
,Iation. (From Mr. Hughos'
speech of acceptance.

AN ADMINISTRATION TOO
CONTENT WITH LEI6-
URELY DISCUSSION.
I do not put life and property
on the eanio footing, but tho
Administration has not only
been remiss with respect to tho
protection ot Amorican lives; It
has been remiss with renpect
to the prolectkn of American
property and Amorhun com
nxrco. It has bcon too much
disposed to bo content with
leisurely discussion. -From Mr.
5 Hughes' speech of acceptance. Q
WANT8 AN EFFECTIVE SYS

Wo proposo to promote by
every prnctlcnblo mentis our
agricultural Interests, anil wo In
clude in this program nn effec

Wo favor the wlso conscrvntlon
