NUMBER 25
Tidings
Would Replace Two
. Boards with One
Petitions are In circulation In the
city seeking to call a special election
lor September 22 for the purpose of
abolishing the springs water commis
sion and park board and providing
for the election at the regular De
cember election of a board of three
members, to be known as the mineral
springs nad park board, and to have
jurisdiction over the parks of the city
and the mineral water system. Funds
are also provided for the upkeep of
the park and for publicity purposes.
The full text of the proposed charter
amendment is published elsewhere In
this Issue and should be read care
fully and studied by every citizen.
With the possible exception of one
or two points, the proposed change
appears to be a good one. The lack
of harmony which has been evident
In the part has been a factor which
has retarded the development of Ash
land. The city council and the park
board did not work in harmony, the
springs commission and the city coun
cil frequently worked at cross pur
poses, and the park board and the
springs commission failed to get to
gether on vital matters, the resulting
friction causing a loss of dollars and
lack of efficiency. The abolishment
of the two boards and the placing of
exclusive jurisdiction over the park
and water system in the hands of the
proposed board appears as a wise
remedy. Under the close scrutiny
which is bound to be given the pro
posed changes, every point Is sure to
he brought out. The Tidings' col
umns are open for discussion of the
proposed charter amendment by citi
zens. Will Fix City Hall
Quarters for Club
The city council has asked for bids
for the reconstruction of a room in
the city ball, used for a jail prior to
the construction of the present jail,
into commodious and well-lighted of
fice quarters which are to be turned
over to the Ashland Commercial Club
at a yearly rental in the neighbor
hood of one dollar. While no definite
. contract has been made for the room
by the club, a representative of the
club made a verbal outline of the
club's wishes in the matter at Tues
day's council meeting which was giv
en the approbation of the council.
The Commercial Club will also have
the use of the assembly hall in the
city hall for their monthly meetings
and other gatherings. The chairs be
longing to the Commercial Club will
also be Installed In the city hall, re
placing the rickety old benches upon
which many a spectator has torn his
trousers.
The new room Jn the city hall is
to be plastered, walls and ceiling,
floored, wainscoted, a big window
and door put In the front, window at
the rear, woodwork stained brown
and walls and ceiling kalsomined a
tan color. Bids are advertised for
In this paper, and the work will be
rushed bo that the club will probably
be able to move into the new quar
ters in a month or so.
Movie Camera
May Be Smashed
Movie Man Hull may be minus a
valuable camera as the result of a
peculiar accident which happened
about a mile and a half this side of
Long's Cabin last night. Mr. Hull,
who had secured some pictures of the
Epworth party on Mt. Ashland, came
on to town ahead of the wagon which
hauled his camera. Mr. Stoner, driv
er of the team, states that a big buck
jumped out into the road in front of
his team, scaring them and causing
them to plunge down over the- grade.
The wagon turned over. Mr. Stbner
escaped with minor bruises and cut
the horses loose, but the movie cam
era Is burled beneath the wagon.
Mr. Hull left this noon to bring in
the remains and hopes that it may
have escaped serious injury, as do the
people who realize the advertising
which Mr. Hull's camera will bring
for Ashland.
The C. A. Smith, Lumber Company

mailed notices of the arrival of his
son, Robert L., who Is just six days

mother. The great, great grandmother,
Mrs. Katherine DacDonald, of Coch

For S.F. Visitors
John Dill, chairman of the com
mittee which is securing cars to bring
the San Francisco Chamber of Com

Saturday, August 26, outlines the

Mayor Johnson, a number by the
Elks quartet and a short talk by
President Smith of the Commercial
Club, with a response from the visit
ors. The ladles of the Civic Improve
ment Club have planned a surprise
which it is rumored will take the
form of roses and big juicy peaches
for all of the two hundred visiting
heads of San Francisco firms.
The visitors will then visit the bus
iness houses of the city. They leave
about 7 o'clock if the attractions of
Ashland do not prove too great.
Eastern States

Friday

setts, Main, Vermont, New . Hamp
shire, Connecticut, Rhode Island,
Delaware, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania are going to have
a meeting at the city hall on Friday
afternoon for the purpose of forming
an organization, which probably will
be known by such a name as the East
ern States Association.
There will probably be a good
many prominent men from these
states in Ashland from time to time,
and by having an organization it will
be possible to entertain these visitors
by the citizens who know them best.
The qualifications for membership
have not as yet been decided, but
will probably specify that one must
have been born In one of the states
or has resided in any one of them
for a period of not less than five
years. This question, together with
the adoption of the constitution and
by-laws, will be taken up at this
meeting.
All residents of Ashland who are
eligible to membership are urged to
attend.
