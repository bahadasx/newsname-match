First Chautauqua
Is Great Success
Plans Under Way for a Bigger and Better
Chautauqua for Next, Year
Malta's first Chautauqua and also I
the first affair of this kind to be
pulled off in this section of the Milk
River valley is now over. The big
tent has been taken down and is now
on its way with thirteen other huge
tents to its winter home in Kansas
City. But the glory of Chautauqua
week will live forever in the hearts
of the Malta people. We have heard
some of the best speakers on the
Chatauqua platform. We have heard,
some of the best musical talent in
the west and we all feel better that
we have had the opportunity of see
ing and hearing what we did.
When the business men of Malta
were approached by the representa
tive of the Ellison-White system last
spring for a Chautauqua here this
summer, it was not with the best of
grace that some of them signed the
guarantee, but now that it is all over
and the people pleased, even the
most radical kicker cannot but say
it was for the best in bringing the
Chautauqua here.
The big doings opened last Thurs
day night and every afternoon and
night up to Tuesday evening, when
the Hawaaians closed the entertain
ment with that beautiful Hawaaian
selection "Aloe-Oe" crowds of our
own and neighboring towns enjoyed
every minute of the week's enter
tainment.
We have heard Victor Murdock.
one of the *greatest speakers of the
day, and we have also heard Sias.
Some of our city fathers may not
have liked the hot shots Sias gave
the city about the weeds, etc., but is
not every thing he said the truth,
and as one of our most prominent
business men told us only last Sun
day, "Sias did not tell anything but
what you have been telling for the
past two years and all the reason it
don't set well is because it is the
truth."

Sunday night the big audience was
well entertained by the Witupski
Hungarian orchestra, assisted by the
beautiful Madame Orvallis in vocal
selections. Her rendition of "My
Rosary" and Mr. Witupski's playing
of "Silver Threads Among the Gold"
were only two of the many good
things of that memorable. night.
Taken as a whole the Chautauqua
program was good from start to fin
ish and we have yet to hear of any
night or afternoon program that
did not please. The entertainment
closed with the Hawaalan concert
Tuesday night at which time Sup
erintendent Murphy announced that
the contract for 1917 had all been
signed up and they would be pleased
to come here again next year and
many more years to come.
The local committee which has
worked so faithfully and well for the
success of the affair are deserving of
the loudest praise and they no doubt
feel well repaid for their work in
that it was a grand success.
During the afternoon and eve
nings of the week the ladies of the
Altar Society of the Catholic church
served ice cream and cake and other
refreshments at the lent which net
ted them quite a tidy sum.
Many have already signed up for
season tickets for next year and the
outlook for a big time ,)gain then
is most promising.
Last week we were in error when
we said David Turner and C. E. Har
per were mixed up in a fight in the
restricted district. They were in a
fight, but it was on this side of the
track and neither of the two boy:
above mentioned had been drinking
The fight was forced on them and
we are pleased to make thecorrection
as we do not care to do any one an
injury.

The self-styled Able, Active, Ag

'T'uesday to even- up with the editor
of this paper for the things we have
said about him and his campaign for
Judge Utter. We were coming out
of the office of Messrs. Tressler &
Kirton when the learned (?) gentle
man (?) swatted us one on the jai.

CITY ADMIINISTRIATION
E. J. flies, in his lecture at the
Chautauqua a few nights ago, told
several facts that did not go down
well with some of the people of
Malta, but nevertheless they were
VACTS and undisputable. He told
of the conditions to the streets and
alleys of Malta, of the unhealthy
and unsanitary conditions, of the
need of lights and numerous other
necessities to keep pace with a town
such as we have here. We have no
apoligies to offer, what the gentle
man said was the truth, but it ap
pears to us that some of the present
city officials would be ashamed to
look the people of Malta in the face
after the grilling the city received
at the hands of Mr. Sias. The pres
ent administration of city has ex
pended from 25 per cent to 40 per
cent more than under that of any
other, and we have less to show for
it. Our streets are in a deplorable
condition the alleys are worse. Filth
abounds everywhere, poll taxes about
one-half collected, dog tax about the
same, gambling in two or more plac
esdrunks on the streets at all times.
There is not an ordinance on the
books of the city but has been brok
en time after time, and what is the
result? A few boys get into a fight
and they are immediately arrested,
but how about the other ordinances?
At the present time it is costing
the city something like $500 per
month for superintendents,police and
clerks. This town, nor any other
of the same size, can stand a drain
like that. We should have some
thing to show for the money.
Let a stranger drop into town and
he will promptly be shown around
and told what great improvements
will be made. How much nicer
would it be if they could say such
and such improvements have beer
made and more are to follow.
Discrimination seems to be the
only plank in the present adminis
tration. R. M. Trafton was forced
to put in something like $2,0011
worth of cement sidewalks. The
United Brethren church was forced
to do likewise, but when it came t.
a the Dunbar property it was left out
and no sidewalk. Mrs. Dorres was
w compelled to move trees to put ii t
cement sidewalk, but when it cant
to an estate on the corner nothint
n was done and the residents of that
particular section of town are stif
without sidewalk,
It is up to the people of Malta tC
k' see that the officials give the city
iq a business administration and iii
something, and let us know what is
a becoming of our money. It is pait
8 out in taxes, but where does it gi

On June 4th, 1915, in criminal
case 140, in Valley county, two de
hi darts charged with gambling
pleaded guilty before Judge Utter.
lie fined each of them $5.00.
On June 5th, 1915, in criminal
case 147, in the same county, two
other defendants charged with gam
bling, pleaded guilty before Judge
Utter. He fined each of them
$25.00.
Section 8416, Revised Codes of
Montana, provides that the crime of
gambling "is punishable by a fine of
I not less than $100, nor more than
$1,000." And also provides that the
guilty person be imprisoned
for not less than three months, nor
more than one year, or such person
may be punished by both such fine
and imprisonment.
It will be observed that under the
statute no fine of less than $100 may
be imposed. Judge Utter not only
i violated the plain provisions of the
; statute In these cases but deprived
t the county of the sum of $340. The
aggregate of the fines collected was
$60, but had Judge Utter followed
the law, the total minimum fines
- would have been $400. Evidently
it was Judge Utter's purpose to make
ta good fellow out of himself with
the gamblers.
This is but one example of Judge
Utter's failure to enforce the crimi
r nal laws. He promises, if elected,
i "to do in the future exactly as he
r has done In the past."
1 Judge Utter has exercised every
- power as judge even to the extent of
violating the statutes of this state to
I gain favor of voters, as these and
I many other cases in the district dis
close. How do you like his law en
r forcement? How do you like his
t promise to conduct his court in the
future, if elected, as he has done in
the past? How do you like this use
less squandering of the taxpayers'
- money?

Judge Utter
Wants Grand Jury
But Phillips County Taxpayers May Ask
for Jury to Investigate Utter
Judge Utter has been on the bench
of this district since March, 1911.
No grand jury has been called in any
county by him. In his public speech
es throughout the district he now
asserts that a grand jury should be
called in each of the three counties
After his five years of neglect of
duty, failure to enforce the criminal
law and squandering the taxpayers'
money, a grand jury is probably bad
ly needed. Since, however, his con
duct is the most important thing to
be investigated, a petition ought to
be made by the tax payers to Gover
nor Stewart to send outside judges
into each of the three counties of
the district to empanel a grand jury
and properly instruct it. For the
consideration of the grand jury in
each of the three counties we suggest
the following subjects for investiga
lion:
1. Judge Utter's threat to call a
grand jury to investigate those op
nosed to his nomination apparently
mnade for the purpose of destroying
opposition to him.
2. Treating various electors
through the district in saloons for
the purpose and with thi 1)ope of in
1noencinig their votes.
The calling of I wo or three
limes as manvy jurors as; is noce-,sary
and excusing a large tnum1br of
them to vote for Iin1.
4. The offering to limn furors
r'rving in his court money wiithoun
disclosiig to such jurors that ml:
sllerk of the court had authority t
issue warrants for thi ilonge a n l
per diem of such jurors, therchy en
deavoriig to induce such juror01 to
believe that he was ,-ranting a 1,1)1
to them so as to indite them t I
vote for him.
Imposing blie i uider I 't anti
gambling law of less than the mini
inum provided for in such law, fot
the purpose of gaining favor o
those upon whom the finel, were in
posed.
6. The refusal of 1Judge Uttel
to call judges from other district
into this district when lie has beei
disqualified, thereby preventing liti
gants from having a speedy trial o
their cases.
7. The drawing of $2391.00, a:

section 30, article 8, of the constitu
tion.
8. Lack of attention to business,
and so conducting his court as to
squander uselessly a large amount
of the taxpayers' money.
We understand that the taxpayers
of this district are now considering
the circulation of petitions asking
Governor Stewart to send judges in
to the three counties of the district
for the purpose of trying and dispos
ing of the large number of cases
neglected by Judge Utter, and to
consider the calling of grand juries
in each of the three counties of the
district.
