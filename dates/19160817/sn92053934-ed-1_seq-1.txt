WILSON CALLS RAILROAD
PRESIDENTS TO CAPITAL
TO ACT IN CONFERENCES
PRESIDENTS PLAN
FOR SETTLING THE
STRIKE SITUATION
As closely as It may be outlined,
the president's plan of settling tho
dispute follows:
1. The railroads must concede with
out qualification the 8-hour day at the
present pay for 10 hours.
2. The men must agree not to Insist
upon their demand for pay and one
half for overtime until a commission
with plenary powers has had an op
portunity to investigate and report on
the cost of the demand to the carriers.
3. The railroads must waive their
counter proposals altogether.
4. Both the railroads and the men
must agree to get together on the find
ings of the commission with respect to
the cost of the overtime scheme. If
those findings develop the fact that the
cost would be excessive to the carriers
the men must consent to pro rata pay
instead of pay and a half. If the find
ings disclose the men should receive
more than pro rata for overtime the
railroads must consent to put into ef
fect the recommendations.
PROWLER KILLED
BY MILL GUARDS
Young Polish Worker Shot to Death at
La Salle Situation Grows 3Iore
Alarming.
La Salle, 111., Aug. 17. Two guards
at the German-American cement plant,
Joseph Burkhardt and W. A. Davy,
were removed to Jail at Ottawa today
as a result of the killing last night of
a young Polish worker who was dis
covered, the guards say, prowling
around the" p fan t. The victim was shot
to death.
The shooting resulted in the first
death since the strike of cement work
ers was declared more than a month
ago. Guards in large numbers are said
to have been imported to protect the
mills. s
Conditions in the strike rone, the
authorities say, are becoming more
alarming and a request may be made
that state troops be returned here.
State's Attorney Wiley of Ottawa ar
rived here today to investigate the sit
uation.
The investigation into the cause of
the fire, which Wednesday night de
stroyed a warehouse of the German
American company, is under way. Au
thorities believe the blaze was of in
cendiary origin.
THE WAR TODAY
After scoring Important gains
in the Somme region, both north
and south of the river, the French
are busily making preparations
for the expected German counter
stroke.
"o such attack developed last
night but the Paris bulletin today
reports intense artillery activity
north of Maurepas.
The new allied advance north of
the Somme weakens the hold of
the Germans on Guillcmont and
Maurepas, which latter place the
French already partly hold. The
objective of the operation is the
important railroad town of Pe
ronne. Today's London official state
ment reports the pushing forward
of the British line west and conth
west of Guillcmont,
Further indications of th stif
fening of the Teutonic resistance
to the Russian advance in Galicia
is contained in today's statement
from IVtrograd which announces
renewed counter attacks by the
Austro-German forces.
Indications of important activity
in the Balkans are increasing.
From the Russian front, the
scene of important developments
yesterday shitted back to the
Somme front where the British and
French stormed nearly three miles
of German trenches, driving for
ward at points to a depth ortfOO to
600 yards. Maurepas and fiery
have lcen flanked on both sides
and official statements say the al
lies are directly in front of the
large railroad town of Cornbles.
South of the Somme, the French
stormed German trenches along
three-quarters of a mile.
For the first time In several days
no imKrtant action is reported
either from the Russian or Ital
ian fronts. The most Interesting
item of news regarding the Italian
advance against Triest Is contain
ed in a dispatch front Milan which
sajs that German troops are to be
employed In the defense of the
Austrian port. If corroborated,
this means that Italy and Germany
will at la.st cuter an active state
of war.
German troops bate won a sue
cess in the t'arathian region. Iter

MANAGERS DROP PLAN.
Is Believed They Refuse to
Concede Eight-Hour Day
i Awaiting Chiefs. .
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today invited the presidents
of the principal roads of tho coun
try to como to Washington Immedi
ately to confer with him on the
threatened railroad etrike. Tending
their arrival he does not plan to see
the committee of managers hero with
whom ho has been meeting.
Tho president sent the following
telegram to the leading railroad pres
idents: Discussion of the matters in
volved in the threatened railroad
6trike has reached a point which
makes it highly desirablo that I
should personally confer with you
at the earliest possible moment
and with the presidents of any
other railways affected who may
be Immediately accessible. Hope
you can make it convenient to
come to Washington at once.
Sock "I Itimatc Authority."
In case President Wilson finds that
any of tho railroad presidents cannot
6peak absolutely for their roads, he
may invite to the White house the
financiers who control them. Officials
said today that the president wants to
deal with the "ultimate authority" on
both sides, in order that negotiations
may be conducted here.
Presents Plan to Employes.
This afternoon at 3 o'clock the pres
ident was to have presented bis plan
to the full committee of 640 employes
in the hope of getting them to ap-
, prove it The result will be present
ed to the railroad presidents later.
Early this mornicg Secretary Tu
multy telephoned to Daniel Wlllard,
president of the Baltimore & Ohio,
regarding the invitation to the rail
road presidents to come to tho White
house, and Mr. Wlllard said he would
do everything possible to arrange a
conference. Judge Chambers of the
federal board of mediation and con
ciliation held a brief conference with
the brotherhood heads this morning.
Further than to say he had one ques
tion on which he wanted a definite an
swer and 'that he got it, the conferees
would not discuss the nature of his
visit. Mr. Chambers went to the
White house immediately upon leav
ing the brotherhood officials.
Settlement Still Possible.
"'I should like to say that the situa
tion still is hopeful," A. B. Garretson.
spokesman for tho employes, said
after Mr. Chambers had left. "Hope
ful is hardly the word I should use. I
should say, though, that I deem a set
tlement still possible.
The president's action In asking for
the presidents themselves Is interpret
ed as meaning that the managers had
refused finally to concede the eight
hour day as the president's plan pro
posal and the question now is to bo
taken up with the heads of tho rail
roads themselves.
Refuse Elght-llonr Day Plan.
Tho situation today was this:
Tho railroads flatly refuse to con
cede the eight-hour day, but axe will
ing to arbitrate that question and all
others before any tribunal the prsi
dent or tho men may decide upon.
The men are willing to arbitrate
some questions under certain condi
tions and are unwilling to arbitrate
others.
Names of Invited Chiefs.
President Wilson's invitation was
sent to tho following railroad presi
dents: Daniel Willard, Baltimore & Ohio;
Samuel Rea, Pennsylvania; Fairfax
