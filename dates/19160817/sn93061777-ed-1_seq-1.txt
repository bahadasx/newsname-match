, BOYS OF COMPANY "K" MAKE
APPEAL FOR MESS FUND
A Call Which Will Have
People of Clovis
The Clovis News received a
letter from the boys of Clovis,
who compose Company "K,"
nivv doing duty on the border at
Columbus, N. M.. which we
print below. The people of Clo
via and Curry County are proud
of its boys on the broder and no
doubt they will raise a mess
fund for them at once. In fact
the movement is already under
way.
The News will take it upon
itself to see that any funds or
food left in our care will be for
warded to the boys at once.
This is a worthy movement and
one that will touch the heart of
every loyal citizen of Clovis.
Ix-t us all put our shoulder to
the wheel and see that a mess
fund worth while is sent to the
boys at the front without any
unnecessary delay. .

Editor News:
It has been quoted that the
Clovis Company "K" is the beBt
organized company, and the city
of Clovis the first in supporting
its men, either in peace or war.
They are men who have left
homes, friends, mothers and rel
atives. No one that remains at
home can imagine the hardships
that we soldiers on the border
must undergo, living in tents,
facing the dust storms, rain and
the oppressive heal, and yet we
always go forward with laughter
and delight in the thought that
the people of Clevis are proud to
knew that we are making good.
Our Ciptian and lieutenants
are always trying in every way
to make our duties (which are
many) lighter. The out-post
guard has its hardships in the
rain, dust or blistering sun, but

duties are no joke in this coun

our mess fund. We are only al
lowed 25 1-4 cents per man, per
day, which is hardly enough to
allow much more than the faint

people of Clovis for that pur

NOW IS THE TIME TO OIL
THE STREETS IN CLOVIS
While the City is Confronted with the Street Sprink
ling Problem. Some Data On the Subject.
While theeity of Clovis is con
fronted with the street sprink
ling problem, now is the oppor
tune time to oil the streets,
which will do away with sprink
ling. The News has gathered some
data upon the subject which we
are pleased to give the citizens
of Clovis, and trust they will
give the matter due consider
ation. There can be no doubt
about the practicability of the
oiling proposition, and coming
timely as it is, will solve the
street sprinkling question once
and fer all.
ihe citizens of this town
would not take ten times the
con of oiling the streets after
they once get it. This is what
the people say in the towns that
have oiled streets. Some claim
that they are more satisfactory
tnan pavements, tnat they are
not so hot and dusty.
Bert Curless, Secretary of the
Chamber of Commerte, has just
received a letter from J. L. Staker
a prominent attorney of Clayton,
Illinois, giving some valuable
pointers in oiling the streets of
that little city, Mr. Staker
writes:
"I have your letter to hand
and take pleasure in replying to
your inquiry. Many of the
streets in this village have been
oiled. The expetase of the oiling
of a lot is about $2.50 for the
owner of each lot of 59 feet
front: that is to pay one-half the
street, in front of his house.
"Samuel I). Hyler, street com
missioner performs the service
very thoroughly. The village
has a tank which carried about
300 gallons, and it takes about
three and a half to four and a
half tanks for a block, to proper
ly oil.
"The village pays for one-half
of the expense of oiling and asks
the lot owner te pay the other
half. This is done by the peti
tion of owner or tenant, who is
generally glad to get the favor
of oil in front of his property.

soil will make a difference in the
amount of oil necessary. You
can probably get oil at a closer
price than we have to pay, but
you might have to use more for
your sandy ground than we use
in our black soil. Our folks find
it veiy acceptable and are pleas
ed with the result, after a season
or two of trial. We got a tank
at first and experimented, per
haps you might better do so and
thus find out the best and most
economical way to use the oil,
cost, method, etc."
The Tucumcari American is
starting a movement to oil the
streets in that town. Read what
it says:
"Say, don't you think it would
be a business proposition to oil
the streets ef this city? We
have been having a lot of dirty
weather, lately, and a little oil
on the troubled waters would be
applicable in this instance.
There is no use to kick about ex
peases but figure on a plan that
will increase your income. There
is no question that you will see
things different when the sand
blow is eliminated and you are
moving about with your eyes
open. A man can't sit on a red
hot stove and write poetry.
Neither can you see much on the
right side of life when your eyes
are sanded while you are on the
way to dinner. Really, there
are many towns poorer than
Tucumcari that have had this
improvement ever since Beau
mont put Texas on the map. If
this city government wants to
pull a stunt that will put our
neighbors gOFsiping. it can be
done with a street grader and a
little crude oil."
Upon investigation the News
finds that the price of crude oil
at the oil fields in Texas is about
$1.50 per barrel or 3 cents per
gallon. An average car will hold
10,000 gallons and the freight
on a car of crude to Clovis is
from $200 to $225, according to
ts sapacity. Therefore the eost
of a car of crude delivered in
Clovis would i be from $500 te
$525.
Twin Girls Die on Same Day
The ten months old daughters
of Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Crandall
of Artesia, died in Clovis last
Friday within a few hours of
each other. The little ones were
twins. The parents had been
here only a short time. One of
the little girls took sick early in
the morning and died shortly
afterward, and the other took
sick about noon and died that
evening. The case puzzled the
attending physicians. The re
mains were shipped to Artssia
for burial.
The Stewart-Reagan Land Co.
recently sold a half seotion of
land three miles east of Clovis to
Tom Keagan. Dr, Miller and Mr.
Bridges. The land was pur

Kansas. They also sold a quar
ter section of land 20 miles
northwest ef town to C. H.
