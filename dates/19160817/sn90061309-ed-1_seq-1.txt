Last Sunday was a very good
day with us. Visiters from some
of the other churches were present.
The subject of the morning dis
course was, "A Good Soldier of
Jesus Christ." Text for the same,
Second Timothy, 2-3.
The singing of the choir added
greatly to the service We hope
the interest in this part of the work
will continue to grow. Nothing adds
so greatly to the life of the service
as really strong spiritual singing.
The return of the bass and alto is
welcomed.
The subject of this weeks prayer
service was, "An Evening with the
Firsts." Suine one member took
the subject, "The First Man," un
other, "The First Jewish General to

Two general stores were entirely
destroyed. The flirms of Sharp &
Son and the Misses Brown occupied
Charles Carlyle's building. The
fire was discovered between 8 and
9 o'clock but practically nothing

Misses Brown had just moved into

TERRIBLE WRECK
Two Killed. One Injured When Uurl
tinfton Fist Freight Leaves
. The Rails Near Here.
About 5 o'clock Tuesday morning
an extra freight. No. 2160 was
wrecked a quartet of a mile west of
the city, or between the fair grounds
and the city lake.
The train was made up of one
car load of wheat and about a
dozen empty box cars.
The culbert was too small to
allow the enormous rain fall to pass
through and the water was backed
up south of the track, flowing over
in places. This naturally softened
the road bed and when the train
went to pass over, the track spread
and the cars were thrown down the
embarkment
The engineer. Al McDonald was
instantly killed. The fireman Rex
Wickizer. and conductor. Darley
Dean, jumped into the water and
escaped. They were badly cut and
bruised. The brakeman. H. E. Mc
Kiddy was caught under the engine
and for 13 hours lay face down
under the wreck. Everything that
could possibly be done to relieve
his suffering was done Citizens as
well as the radroad men, worked
heroically, part of the time in mud
and water above their waists. Two
wreckers and a pile driver was here
but the ground was so soft that the
engine could not be lifted.
After five o'clock in the evening
it was decided his leg must be
taken off
Dr. Turner administered the
anaesthetic and Dre Pipkin, Guilford
ami- Southern.-uok the iojuraii
member off just above the knee
He was placed on a cot and this
put in a car and taken at once to
the New Monroe hotel but he died
before he was put to bfd. The
body was taken to Wilsons under
taking room and prepared for burial
He was taken to Brookfleld on No.
55 His wife had oeen called and
arrived during the afternoon.
Harold Eugene McKiddy was
27 years of age He had been
msrried less than a year.
Engineer McDonald was about
48 years of age. His body was
taken to Brookfield Tuesday He
left a wife and several children.
Messrs Wickizer and Dean were
both from Brookfield. They were
experienced train men. This was
Mr. McKiddy's third trip. He had
formerly been employed in the
shops at Bronklield The wreck is
being rapidly cleared away and the
track has been in use since about
midnight Tuesday.
It is estimated that the wreck
will cost the Burlington about
$75000
No. IB was late that morning
and passed over the track only
abou: an hour before the wreck. It
is said that the freight side tracked
at Hunnewell to let the passenger
pass. No. 16 carried 13 coaches
that morning.
Dr. Guilford was called to the
wreck Wednesday morning to dress
the band of one of the repair men
which had been crushed. He was
not seriously injured.
Removal Notice.
We will be ready for business in
our new room, north east corner of
Main and Summer streets, Saturday.

neighbors these were saved. Elbert
Yates was one of the volinte :n
an I his face and hands were burned
in the work.
The approach at the south bridge
was washed away by the high wat
er which was higher than it has
been at Indian Creek for thirty
years
Electric Storm Friday
The rain that came Friday even
ing was a general one and the
clouds were full of electricity.
Len Gosney'8 icw home north of
town was struck by lightning. It
took a flue off to the roof and
made a hole the size of a tub
where it entered the house. The
rafters were splintered and there
would, no doubt, have been a ser
ious blaze, but that the rain that
fell in torrents extinguished it.
Mr. Gosney's daughter, Helen,
and their guest, Miss Beulah Jack
sun, had gone down stairs about
five minutes before the house was
struck. They were not hurt. We
understand Mr Gosney had some
insurance.
South of town the lightning was
just as bad. A burn belonging to
C. A Jones was struck and with
its contents, was burned Cecil
Greeves and J. H. Bond were haul
ing goods out to the store at Far-
mersville They drove into the
barn for shelter, The lightning
stunned them both but they were
able to get out with their loads.
A buggy belonging to Mr Jones
was all that was saved. The barn
contained hay and oats, The fire
wns scattered over the hay and all
was consumed in a few moments.
We understand that Mr. Jones
had $1200 insurance.
