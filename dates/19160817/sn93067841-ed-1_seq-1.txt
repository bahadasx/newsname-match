Saturday, August 5, Mr Ragsdale
tvent to Kingstree and by special anpointment
spoke to a large number
of Williamsburg citizens to whom he
undertook to .explain the flood sufferers'
relief measure which passed
Congress August 2. In the course of
his remarks Mr Ragsdale stated that
he understood that his opponent, Mr
Evans, had circulated a letter published
in The State of that morning
signed by Mr Richard S Whaley, a (
member of Congress, from the First
district of South Carolina, denying 1
that Mr Ragsdal? had offered any 1
resolution for the relief of the flood 1
sufferers or that the Military corn- 1
mittee of the House had considered
any resolution looking to that end 1
except his (Whaley's). Mr Ragsdale '
stated that he would put up $500 to 1
go to the fbod sufferers if it could 1
be proved he had not offered the
resolution which was incorporated in
the measure that passed Congress,
. provided Mr Evans would put up
r $100 the same purpose if Ragsdale
not able to prove that he 1
had offered that resolution. Mr Evans
stated that he had circulated no
report of any kind; that he had read
and directed attention of several to
Mr Whaley's letter; that he did not
vouch for the accuracy of either Mr
Whaley's or Mr Ragsdale's statements.
that being a question of veracity
between those two gentlemen..
Mr Ragsdale then read a resolution
which he stated he had offered in
Congress.
Returning to Florence, Mr Evans 1
sent a telegram to Mr Whaley in 1
Washington which appears below. 1
* Mr Whalev replied to that telegram.

To the Editor of The State:
In your issue of August 1 there
appears on page 6 an article entitled
"Favors Assistance to Flood Victims.
House Military Committee Indorses
Rag^dale Resolution in Aid of Sufferers."
The article states the committee
on military affairs made a
favorable report on the Ragsdale
resolution appropriating $540,000
for the relief of sufferers in South
Carolina, Alabama and other States.
This article is misleading and evidently
your correspondent was wrongly
informed. I introduced the only
resolution for the relief of the flood
sufferers of South Carolina and it
was referred to the committee on
military affairs, of which Representative
Nichols is a member. I appeared
before the committee in advocacy
of my resolution. No resolution
was introduced by Mr Ragsdale
and he did not appear before the
committee, but reported an omnibus
resolution carrying an appropriation
for all the States which suffered from
the flood and combined the resolution
introduced by the members
from the respective States.
The resolution which was passed
today by the House was the Senate
resolution in practically the same
pnnfainpH in fhp HniijSP rps- i
station as reported by the committee.

In reply I beg to sav I do not care
to take or have any part in the Con- 1

am only replying in order to keep
the record straight.
I introduced resolution for relief
i of flood sufferers of my State July
j25, appearing before the Military
! committee July 31 in advocacy of it. ]
! Mr Nichols of Spartanburgis a mem;
ber of that committee. We were the 1
only South Carolinians present. The
committee included all the resolu- 1
i tions introduced by members of dif- 1
j ferent States in one resolution. This y
1 committee resolution with South *
! Carolina included along with other c
States was acted on by the House f
August 2. I searched the Congres- 1
sional Record for a resolution intro- 1
duced by Mr Ragsdale up to the day ^
; this resolution was passed by the 8
; House and could find none for my ?
1 State except my own. Mr Aiken and 1
Mr Nichols searched the Bill Clerk's t
' office and made inquiry and could $
find and learn of none and so inform- ^
! ed me. Thursday morning when the *
! Congressional Record of August 2 ^
! came to our hands I found on page ?

j that the gain in the past two or

and believing that there
are yet many constructive measures
to engage the attention o, 1 ongreas
which vitally affect the well being
of the South as wel! as the economic
life of the nation, the friends of Mr
Mclnnes feel that he is eminently
the proper man to represent this

Letters which have been received
here from prominent men in every

The second week of the county
11 campaign opened Tuesday at Trio.
The candidates had had an opportui
nitv to rest up since last Thursday
and get their speeches rounded out
into apple pie order for their audir
; ences.
The editor of The Record, as he
1 stated last week he would do.accom!
pahied the party to Trio for the
purpose of giving a synopsis of what
' the various candidates had to tell
i the voters. This we are forced to
I make as brief as possible on account
of lack of space,there being a greater
demand upon the columns of The
Record for advertising space this
, week than we had anticipatfd when
1 we struck out for Trio Monday af'
ternonn.
" The meeting. was held under a
* large 9hed in the heart of the town
. and was presided over by Mr W T
, Rowell, one of the big-hearted citi1
zens of the village and himself a
3 candidate for the office of Sheriff.
[ The meeting was called to order at
; 10:30 and opened with prayer by Mr
1 Williams, a village layman. Candii
dates for the office of Magistrate at
' Trio were the first to speak. Mr J
. W Lockliear was present but did not
[ speak on account of sickness.
FOR CORONER.
Following these gentlemen, the
aspirants to the office of Coroner
were next introduced. Mr J J Han
* na was absent.
Mr Eddie D Epps announced his
candidacy and told the audience that
he was competent to fill the office.
Mr H M Burrows said he had held

Mr J I Morris presented himself
as a candidate for Coroner the second
time, thanked the voters of Trio
for their past support and told them
that in the present contest they could
not vote for a man who needs the
office more than he.

and pledged a faithful performance
of its duties if elected, and

I other Coroner this side of Black fiver,
j Mr T J Spring told the audience
, that he was neither a politician nor
a statesman,but an honest citizen aspiring
to be Coroner. He referred to
the office as an important one, because
in case the Sheriff becomes incapacitated
his duties fall upon the
Coroner. It'was therefore necessary
to elect a competent man to the office.
His advantage over other candidates
lies in his residence at the
county seat, where all matters pertaining
to law and order have to be
referred. He promised a faithful
performance of duty if elected.
Mr W I Tisdale announced himself
a candidate for the office of Coroner
and pledged his very best efforts to
fill the office satisfactorily if elected.
