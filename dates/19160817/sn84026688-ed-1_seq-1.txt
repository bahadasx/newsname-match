GERMANS USE THE INRIATiVE
IN SECOND YEAR OF GREAT WAR
Co-Operation Among the Entente Allies Brings Sweeping Change
Over the Aspect of Military Affairs—Two Largest Em
pires of Earth, Russia and Great Britain, at
Last Fully Organized Second Year’s
Campaigns Reviewed.
New York. —Germany in on the de
fensive. The Initiative Ims passed to
the entente allies. This- Is the one
great outstanding fact of the second
year of the great war.
Before, she alined a blow where she
pleased and the allies parried It as
best they might. She seized most of
Belgium and a seventh of France,
Twice she overwhelmed the Russians
who had penetrated East Prussia.
She smashed her way far Into the
czar’s dominions and crushed Serbia
and Montenegro. She directed a fear
ful battering-ram of shells and hu
man bodies on Verdun.
But with the present summer a
sweeping change came over the as
pect of military affairs.
Co-operating through the allies’ war
council with Gen. Joseph Joffre at Its
head, the Italians heat back the Aus
trian columns In the Trentlno, the
Russians drove the Teutons before
them In the East with horrible de
struction and the British and French
began a slow and methodical bending
of the long established lines In the
West.
At Last Fully Organized.
These are the movements which are
still going on ns the war enters Its
third, and according to Lord Kitch
ener’s Delphic prediction, final year.
Whether the kaiser will retrieve him
self again seize the Initiative and en
ter on new campaigns of conquest
cannot be foretold. One thing Is cer
tain, the two largest empires of the
earth, Russia and Great Britain, are
at last fully organized for war
against him.
On the first anniversary of the war,
August 1. 1915. the Austro-Germaff
sweep of Poland was In full swing.
Lublin fell that day: Cholrn, August
2; Warsaw. August 6; Ivnngorod. Au
gust 7; Seroek. August 9; Lomza, Au
gust 11 : Siedlce and Sokolow, August
14; Kovno, August 19; Novogeor
glevsk. August 21 ; Ossowlec, August
24; Kovel, August 25; Brest-IJtovsk,
August 27; Ollta, August 28; Lutsk,
September 2; Brody, September 3;
Grodno, September 4; Dubno. Sep
tember 16; Plnsk, September 17, and
Vllnn, September 20.
It seemed to neutral observers noth
ing could stop the Teutons In the
East, and It was generally believed
the Invaders had themselves chosen
the line extending from just west of
Riga, nearly straight south, to Rou
mania on which they spent the win
ter.
Russia Seemed Beaten.
Even when, on September 8, the
czar took command of all his armies
In person, won a victory near Turno
pol, September 10, and recaptured
Lutsk September 20, aud Czartorysk
October 20, few believed the Russians
could revive. Lutsk was soon lost
again, and on October 25 the Germans
stormed Illuxt. Then things settled
down for the winter and almost every
neutral critic thought the spring would
see a resumption of the Teuton drive.
On October 8, the Teutons crossed
the Serbian border at mauy points
and five days later the Bulgarians,
newcomers In the war, Invaded from
the east Fighting desperately but
hopelessly, the Serbians were pressed
back by torrents of heavy shells to
which they could not reply, and on
November 29 the German general staff
was able proudly to announce that the
operations against Serbia had ended
In complete success, while Austria at
the same time was finishing off Mon
tenegro.
But unsuccessful as the year 1915
hud been to the allies In the field,
their will to conquer did not waver.
At the moment early In December,
when the German Imperial chancellor
was making a clear offer of peace lu
a speech to the relchstag, the rep
resentatives of Germany's enemies
were meeting lu a new war council at
Paris, resolved to redouble their her
culean efforts and never compromise.
Conscription in England.
On December 21, David Lloyd-
Oeorge, the strongest man In England,
declared Great Britain faced defeat
unless greater efforts were made; and
Just a week later he demanded general
conscription, threatening to resign If
this measure were not put Into effect.
The conscription bill passed Its first
reading In the house of commons Jan
uary G, and spring saw It In full force.
Premier Asquith was able to announce
that England’s total effort was five
million men.
Meanwhile In the East, a greater
giant was nursing his wounds and re
gaining his strength In four-fold de
gree.
A forewarning came to the world on
February 17, when Erzerum was ta
ken. On April 19 the great Black
sea port of Treblzond fell, and two
days later the first Russian contingent
landed In France. Still the German
writers would not believe, and It took
the magnificent Russian drive of June,
which won nil of Bukowlna and a
large slice of Volhynla and Galicia to
convince them that Russia was again
a force to be reckoned with.
Russia Well Equipped.
To understand this phenomenon of
Russian resurrection It Is necessary to
realize not only that the Russians now
have the heavy artillery and shells
THURMONT. FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, AUGUST 17, 1916.
they Inched In the great retreat, but
that their losses In numbers bother
them not at all.
Seven million young men have come
of military age in Russia since the
war begun, and of these at least five
million are fit for duty. Despite her
gigantic losses, It is quite possible
there are more soldiers and potential
soldiers in Russia today than when the
war started. Certainly there are now
and will he for many years to come
all the "cannon fodder’’ that can bo
utilized at the front.
Erroneously considering the western
front the most dangerous, the German
general staff ou February 21 begun a
heavy attack on the fortress of Ver
dun, with the object of using up
French ammunition and men until no
allied offensive would he possible this
year.
Being on the outside of a curved Hue
they were able to place more guns and
maneuver more freely tlmu their op
ponents, and month after month they
drew closer to the now famous little
city.
Whether their gains were victories
or defeats will only be known after
the war, when we learu the number of
killed and wounded they paid for
each point. Tiny advanced, but were
never able to stampede the defenders.
Perhaps Verdun will be the lust
great German offensive. Certainly to
day the Teutons have their hands full
stemming the Russian advance, which
Is pcnctrutug Transylvania, and the
Anglo-French pounding attack along
the Somme.
Austria on Defensive.
The Austrians, who In the latter half
of May debouched from the Trentlno
and almost gained the foothills and
smiling plains of Italy, are also con
tent to stand and ward off the blows
of the Italians, after giving up most of
their gains.
The year saw the Germans lose
their Cameroon colony In January,
while columns of Belgians. French and
British close In on the stout defenders
of the East African colony, the last of
the kaiser's oversea possessions.
In Mesopotamia the British, pene
trating to within seven miles of Bag
dad, were defeated and forced to re
treat, being finally besieged in Kut-el-
Ainiira on December 10. A relieving
expedition was unsuccessful and on
April 30 the garrison capitulated.
On April 25, Sir Roger Casement
was captured attempting to land from
a German submarine on the Irish
coast. The next day the Sinn Fein
society revolted, seized Dublin and
set up a provisional republic. The re
bellion was quelled lu less than a
week.
On June 3 the German and British
fleets engaged in a great battle off
Skaggernik. Although the Germans
claimed a victory, they have not yet
followed It up by coming out to deal
another blow at the blockading ves
sels. The reports of losses by the
two sides are impossible to harmonize.
War Costs Fifty-Five Billion.
On August 1, the second anniversary
of the start of the great war, the di
rect money cost to all the belligerents
reached $55,000,000,000.
This Is the consensus of financial
opinion here. Estimates six months
ago were slightly lower, but the dully
cost has mounted steadily and the
figures given are considered conserva
tive.
The direct cost does not Include the
losses by destruction of property, by
the disorganization of civilian Indus
try, by the death and crippling of

The war Is now costing all belliger
ents more than $110,000,000 a day. This
is divided among thu principal nations
us follows: Great Britain, $30,000,000
(official figures); France, $17,000,000;
Russia, $18,000,000; Italy, $8,500,000;
Germany, $23,000,000, and Austro-Uuu
gary, $12,000,000, the lesser powers
making up the balance.
Great Britain Is the only power
which Is paying pan of the capital cost
of the war out of current Income. Ger
mauy Is compounding her debt by not
taking In tuxes enough to cover all her
Interest charges.
The financial situation of both sides
is fairly good. The same cannot bo
said for the economic situation. Ger
many aud her allies are plainly In dis
tress In many ways. Few or none have
died of actual hunger, but the vitality
of many noncombutuuts is lowered by
luck of proper food. There Is a great
scarcity of rubber, copper, high grade
Iron, material for warm clothing aud
au almost absolute luck of strictly ex
otic products, such us tea, coffee uud
cocoa.
In Great Britain the common people
have never been so prosperous. The
cost of living has advanced by more
than half, hut wages have Increased
still more and the demand for labor,
both by the government aud by private
enterprises Is insatiable.
Neutrals Wax Fat
France, too, has largely recovered
from the financial shock, though ac
tivity is not ou such a great scale us lu
England. In Russia private business Is
not good, but owing to the suppression
of vodka, the mujlk, Is happier today
and Is saving several times us much
money us ever before.
Italy Is suffering from a dearth of
coal, which has closed most of her fac
tories.
Some of the neutral countries of Eu
rope, especially Denmark, Sweden and
Norway are becoming opulent from war
business. In Holland the upper classes
have made money, while there have
recently been food riots by the lower
classes.
Switzerland Is harassed continually
by both sides to the quarrel, Germany
demanding to he allowed to purchase
nud export goods freely from Swiss
towns and the allies threatening to
withhold food and other supplies if
Germany Is provisioned by her moun
tain neighbor.
Japan, the United States, Culm and
some of the South American countries
were never so prosperous before lu
their history, due to the stimulus of
war orders, which has galvanized do
mestic business as well,

The man gave chase. Others Joined

He was brought to the Emergency hos

THE NATION IS SHOCKING
LY UNPREPARED.
It Is apparent that we are
shockingly unprepared. There
is no room for controversy on
this point since the object les
son ou the Mexican border. All
our available regular troops
(less, 1 believe, than 40,000) are
mere or in Mexico, and as these
have been deemed insufficient
the entire National Guard has
been ordered out; that Is, we
are summoning practically all
our movable military forces in
order to prevent bandit incur
sions. In view of the warnings
of the past three years, it Is
Inexcusable that we should find
ourselves In this plight. For
our faithful guardsmen, who
with a fine patriotism responded
to this call and are bearing this
burden, 1 have ) othing but
praise. But I think it little
short of absurd that we should
be compelled to call men from
their shops, their factories, their
offices and their professions for
such a purpose. This, however,
Is not all. The units of the Na
tional Guard were at peace
strength, which was only about
one-half the required strength.
It was necessary to bring In
recruits, for the most part raw
and untrained. Only a small
percentage of the regiments re
cruited up to war strength will
have had even a year's training
In the National Guard, which at
the maximum means one hun
dred hours of military drill, and,
on the average, means much
less. Men fresh from their
peaceful employments and phy
slcally unprepared have been
hurried to the border for actual
service. They were without
proper equipment; without
necessary supplies; suitable
conditions of transportation
were not provided. Men with
dependent families were sent;
and condition* which should
have been well known were dis
covered after the event. And
yet the exigency, comparatively
•peaking, was not a very grave
one. It Involved nothing that
could not readily have been fore
seen during the past three years
of disturbance, and required
only a modest talent for organ
ization. That this Administra
tion while pursuing Its course
In Mexico should have permitted
such conditions to exist is al
most incredible. —From Mr.
Hughes' speech of acceptance.
ON THE SAND
By LOUISE OLIVER.
The swim out to the sand bar and
back six times repeated hud made Ted
tired. Add to that a scorching July
sun, the inviting shade of a beach
chair, and a natural propensity for
sleep at any time aud under all condi
tions, and you can readily understand
why morplieiis found him an easy vic
tim that eventful morning.
Suddenly something lilt him with
sickening force in the solar plexus.
Then something said softly: "Goo!"
and, with a few delighted gurgles,
“Goo!” again. A baby looked up at
him with placid blue eyes and twisted
the corners of its little rosebud mouth
Into u thousand smiles.
"Hello, there, mister or miss or
whatever you are!" Ted exclaimed.
"Where did you conic from?"
Baby gurgled an answer.
"You don’t say so! Well, if you hud
only sent word I might have been bet
ter prepared to receive you. I sup
pose—” Ted looked around and saw
no one who appeared to have lost a
baby recently, or who might lu any
way be associated with one. "I sup
pose," he said, “that you fell out of
the chair, seeing that you bad such
a nice soft tiling to land ou!”
“When you smile at me so sweetly,
I think you’re a girl. The girls all
like me to pieces. Honor bright!" The
wide-open blue eyes searched him In
quiringly. "All except one, and she
doesn't think I’m worth two for a cent.
But It's all because she doesn't know
me. We have never been Introduced.
By Jove, here she comes now I"
A variety of reasons caused him to
pick the baby up just then—either to
hide the confusion which he always
felt when the girl came near, or lie
cause It looked heartless to let a beau
tiful, embroidered, sbell-pluk baby lie
unprotected on the sand.
The girl passed, but not before she
had taken In the stage setting and the
chief performers of the little act.
To go back, Ted and the girl were
staying at the same hotel. He had
tried to meet her —as lie had explained
to the huhy—hut no mutual friend had
so far appeared.
The girl walked along with her com
panion. hut turned hack as she saw
something lying on the sand. Ted’s
heart nearly stopped when he saw her
coming, and he almost dropped the
hahy, hut he clutched it tightly, desper
ately, when she picked up the toy and
handed it to him, with: “Here Is your
baby's rattle!" and, half-stopping, add
ed: "Cute little thing—looks like
you 1"
She was gone with that, and Ted
suddenly wished the sands would swal
low him up and spare him any further
torment of living. His huhy! Merci
ful heavens!
He laid hahy In Us soft nest, gave
It the rattle and tried to collect his
scattered senses by another swim to
the bar. When he returned baby was
gone. He breathed more freely then.
Another day Ted came out of a
movie Just as a woman passed wheel
ing a baby perambulator. Something
flew out of the carriage and landed at
his feet. He recognized the blue rattle
of his friend, the baby, and bunded It
over.
"Oh, thank you!” beamed the mother.
“She’s always throwing it out.” She
was young and pretty—scarcely more
than a girl. It occurred to Ted to re
late the episode of the baby’s full, and
he did so, suiting his step to her own.
Of course, the girl passed Just then,
as the young mother was listening with
all attention to Ted.
"Darn!” ho exclaimed, stopping.
"I beg your pardon 1"
He apologized profusely. “I forgot
something, and must go back If you
will excuse me,” ho said, as he lifted
his hat and turned in the direction the
girl had taken.
He followed, unabashed, desperate I
Ted came up beside her, and after
an Irresolute minute spoke: "I should
like to talk with you just a minute, If
you don’t object I"
She looked up. “Object? Well, I’ll
have to listen, I suppose. Go ahead."
"That baby Isn’t mine!”
“I know It Isn’t.”
"What! Excuse me—l didn’t under
stand. I thought you thought—”
"He thought, we thought, you
thought, they thought,” she finished
mockingly.
Ted was very red lu the face by this
time.
“Now listen," said the girl. "I am
that baby’s aunt. I was only teasing
you, so don’t worry about It any more."
He digested this. "Why don’t you
like me?” he went on. “It’s been so
evident lu a hundred ways that you
don't. I’m really curious about it. Do
you mind telling me?"
"Mercy 1” she cried. “I have cer
tainly developed Into a regular bureau
of Information. But I'll tell you that,
too! It’s because you are here having
a good time for a mouth while George
Bronson, your partner, who happens
to be my hrother-ln-law and that ba
by’s father, Is at home working his
head off In a hot office when he Is
dying to be here with his family. He
can’t leave as long us you are away!”
Ted was speechless. "But I’d have
gone a week ago If —If—It hadn’t been
for you!” he declared suddenly.
Then the girl smiled, the very sort
of u smile he wanted to see. “It’s
wicked for me to keep George away
from May and the baby, Isn't It?” she
said. “I'll go home tomorrow.”
"Then I'll go, too,” smiled Ted.

dy!” "Hurrah for Teddy!”, and when
the meeting adjourned he made the
following statement:
“It is an admirable speech and I
wish to call attention to the following
points:
"1 am particularly pleased with the
exposure of the folly, and worse than
(oily, of Mr. Wilson’s Mexican policy
and of the way In which this policy
has brought humiliation to the United
States and disaster to Mexico itself.
“Moreover, 1 am very glad of the
straightforward manner in which Mr.
Hughes has shown the ridicule with
which Mr. Wilson has covered this na
tion by the manner In which he al
lowed foreign powers to gain the im
pression that although he used the
strongest words in diplomacy they
were not to be taken seriously.
Not Word* Which Count
“As Mr. Hughes said, It is not words
but the strength and resolution behind
the words which count. As Mr.
Hughes pointed out, there Is no doubt
that If Mr. Wilson’s conduct and ac
tion had been such as to make the
foreign nations believe that he meant
precisely what he said In his ‘strict
accountability’ there would have been
no destruction of American lives by
the sinking of the Lusitania.
“When Mr. Hughes uses strong
words his record shows that they are
always backed by strong deeds, and
therefore in the enormous majority of
cases the use of strong words renders
It unnecessary ever to have recourse
to strong deeds.
“Again, Mr. Hughes speaks In char
acteristically straightforward fash
ion of the outrages committed on mu
nitions plants, and all men, whether
cit'zens of foreign nations or nominal
citizens of our own land, who had In
any shape or way abetted or condoned
those actions can understand that Mr.
Hughes, If President, will protect
these domestic American Interests and
punish offenders against them with
the fearlessness and thoroughness
that he showed In dealing with the
powers of evil at Albany.
Brought Nation to Ignominy.
“Just before coming in to listen to
Mr. Hughes’ Just characterization of
Mr. Wilson’s failure to protect the
lives and property of Americans In
Mexico and on the high seas, I hap
pened to pick up John Flske's “Critical
Period of American History,” and was
struck by the following two sentences:
“ ‘A government touche® the lowest
point of Ignominy when It confesses
Its inability to protect the lives and
the property of Its citizens. A gov
ernment which has come to this has
failed In discharging the primary func
tion of government and forthwith
ceases to have any reason for exist
ing.’
“Mr. Hughes has pointed out In his
speech with self-restraint, but with
emphasis, that it Is precisely this
primary function which Mr. Wilson's
Administration has failed to discharge
and that It Is precisely this point of
Ignominy to which he has reduced
the nation over which he Is Presi
dent.”
I I A POLICY OF FIRMNESS AND g
CONSISTENCY NEEDED. 8
The Nation has no policy of 8
aggression toward Mexico. We S
have no desire for any part of X
her territory. We wish her to 8
have peace, stability, and pros
perity. We shall v ave to adopt
a new policy, a policy of Ann
uess and consistency through 5
which alone we can promote an :*
enduring friendship. We de- x
mand from Mexico the protoc- £
tion of the lives and the prop- x
erty of our citizens and the ee- c
curlty of our border from depre- x
datlons. Much will be gained x
If Mexico Is convinced that we £
contemplate no meddlesome In- x
terterence with what does not I
concern us. but that we propose ;i
to insist tn a firm and candid \
manner upon the performance *
of International obligations. To
a stable government, appropri- ;*
ately discharging Its Interna
tlonal duties, wo should give un- X
grudging support. A short perl- 5
od of firm, consistent ajid X
friendly dealing will accomplish S
more than many years J vacil- X
latlon. —From Mr. Hughes’ 3
