lie found ithographing presses, chem

the other essentials of a complete plant
for making counterfeit money.
Antonio Monteforti, expert engraver,
who was at work. was arrested, along
with Luigi Barracotta, who was proiilly
survey.ng a b'g press that had been
moved recently into the ground floor.
An alleged plot to flood the country
with $I,000,00 in counterfeit $1, .2, $5 and
$10 bills was uncovered, it is said. just
before the leaders wore ready to print
and send the money to the middlemen.
The scheme was the biggest ai.d most
elaborate that has been unearthed in
many years, and the arrests were made
and the ;araphernalia seized before one
bill had been piinted.
Chief Flynn nipped a scheme that had
been worked out with the utmost detail.
According to the evidence obtained, the
plan of the big enterprise was to make
enough plates so that $1.000.L0 of the
notes could be printed within a short,
time. The next step contemplated was
to destroy the entire counterfeiting equip
ment and dispose of the bills at the rate
of 35 cenl on the dollar, realizing about
$I 50,000.
There was not a flaw in the smooth
scheme-exc'pt one, namely that two of
the conspirators were overheard dis
cussing a phase of it one night in an
Italian cafe. That was in March. When
Chief Flynn got word of the plot he

London, Aug. 16.-A new blow, for
which the French and British artillery
ias been preparing the way for more

against the German front both north and
south of the Somme. As a result Teuton

mn both sides of the villages of Maure

wvhile south of the river the German line
:hree-quarters of a mile long was seized

These successes, which mark the oren

Throughout Germany the authorities
have their hands full confsrating dand
trying to trace the source of pamphlets
advocating peace at any price.
This symptom of revolt among a large
section of the people recently assumed
ilarming porportion A few days a;;o
there was a house to house search in Ber
lin, resilting in the arrests of an editor
and printer associated with the Socialis1
Drganization. Strone-st measures, how
ever, failed to suppress this form of
agitation against war, which is so wide
spread as to baff:e the efforts of the
military and polic.-. It is proof of the
existen-e of a grat under-current of
discontent approaching rebellion among
the working classes of Germany.
The well-informed Cologne correspon
dent of the Tyd, writes:
'Complete removal of the censorship
may be expe ted shortly. as the authori
ties can no longer oppose the incras
Ing stream of protests and the bitter
agitation among the people. The only
result of the government's measures of
suppression is the appearance in suc
cession of secret'y produced pamphlets
distributed from hand to hand, which ar
increasing the prevailing unrest and the
general feeling of collapse.
Removing the censorship would be a
