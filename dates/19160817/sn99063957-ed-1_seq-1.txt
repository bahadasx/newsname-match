Dallas, Texas, Aug. 17. Nationnl

border and are choosing the two most

tion and self inflicted wounds.
This was the statement today of Roy

connected with the hospital corps of "the
Texas National Guard. He was in Dal
las to take a deserter back to camp.
"There are now between 10 and 20
men in the Texas national guard hos

their legs, feet, and hands, as a result
of their trying to get their relense from
border duty," said Oaiubrell.
"Since I have been down there a
large number of men have been sent to
the hospital who shot a finger or toe
off, but none of them have been re
leased. The officers decided in most
of the cases that the shooting was not
accidental. We have had a large num

The new French offensive in no way
resembles the Russian stejm roller. In
stead, it hammers continually with
blow upon blow nt any giveu point
until eventually, the French officers
believe, it must break down both th
German defenses ami the resistance of
the German army. The success of this
steady hammering is demonstrated
both in the actunl a Ivance and the
influx of prisoners who have surrend
ered in huge numbers.
Before going to the fighting front 1

the lines for feeding the offensive. It

London, Aug. 17. Strong Austro-Ger-mau
counter attacks have halted the
Russian and Italian offensives tempo
rarily, though the great battle of the
Somme continues to progress favorably
for the allies. .
For the first time in more than a fort
night, the official statement from the
Russian war office today recorded no
further gains. Petrograd dispatches
carried the admislson that enemy coun
ter attacks have checked General Brusi
lo'ff 's armies. The German war office
reported not only tho repulse of all Rus
sian attacks but the capture of a dom
inating height In the Carpathians.
The arrival of Austrian reinforce
ments and the necessity of straighten
ing out the Italian front have halted
General Cadorna's march southward
against Trieste. Officinl dispatches
from the German, French and British
war offices regarding the outcome of
severe fighting on the Somme front
vesterday and Inst night contained
sharp contradictions. The Germans ad
mitted the loss of COO yards of first
line trenches to the French south of the
Somme, but announced that both the
British and French wero driven out of
trenches they penetrated north of the
river.
General Haig in his first report on
yesterday's fighting ' on the Som
me front, announced the capture not
only of positions around Giiilleinont, of
ficially reported from Paris last night,
but also the taking of 300 yards of Ger
man trenches. The French war office
reported violent artillery struggles on
the Somme front last night, but said
the Germans mado no attempt to re
conquer positions captured by the al
lies yesterday.
Similar contradictious are contained
in official reports regarding recent op
erations in the Balkans. A delayed Bul
garian official statement today claimed
the repubie of strouir French attacks

French wnr offico announced successes

have displaved in a confidential com
munication to the state department
American correspondents iu Berlin
recently handed to the ambassador a
protest against British censorship of
cable dispatches and mail mutter tboy

pointcd out that the British censor
badly mutilated many of their dis
patches and that a large per cciilnge
of their mail stories failed to reach
America at ail.
In transmitting the report to the
state department, Ambassador Gernril
is reported to have sent along a confi
dential note, recommending that no ac
tion lie taken by the American gov
ernment unless Germany removed the
c-c:iHor.-hi) on news sent to America.
How this alleged confidential note be
came public property is not known, but
the contents of the message soon be
came known, in newspaper circles.
"The American government and its
organs already have endured many
brutal British infringements. " said the
Morgeupost. " Kven Americans re
proach their officials. They have de
graded themselves by giving up their
neutrality and honor as accomplices of
Knglnnd, so it is presumable that they
will also endure this infringement and
the attitude of their ambassador,
whereby tho British infringement is
supported.
"We doubt whether the German for
eign office will be satisfied with Ge
rard's conduct. We iioe the govern
ment will find mesns to correct his
strange attitude. The German censor
ship does nut concern him ami he has
no right to criticise measures necessary

having talked to them just one
hour.
The president told the meu he
wanted quick action on his pro

the country, for whom ho was
speaking, were impatient to
know the result. He said he
would havo to tell the people
what he proposed and what both

(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 17. An eight hour
day at once with the present 10 hours'
pay and the investigation of overtime
pay and other collateral Issues by a com
mission appointed by himself was Bug
gested by President Wilson this after
noon to the 640 representative of the
railroad brotherhoods as a means of
averting the threatened general strike.
The men adjourned to talk It over
among themselves tonight, declining the
president's suggestion that they use the
East room where he had addressed them
to ballot on the proposal. However,
prominent men among the brotherhood
represtntatives indicated strongly as
they left the White House that the
president's plan is acceptable.
Washington, Aug. 17. The first of
the 040 members of the railroad broth
erhood general committee begnu filing
into the Fast entrance of the White
House at 2:45 this afternoon. A large
crowd witnessed their arrival.
Although A. B. Garretson of the sub
committee had a copy of the presi
dent's proposal 10 lines in length,
written on White House stationery by
the president himself none of the gen
eral committee had read it. I.ee, Gar
ter and Stone of the sub-committee had
duplicates.
It was not discussed, it was declared
nt the meeting of tho general committee
at the Bijou theatre, which lasted from
1 o'clock until 2.
"The president hiaiself is to present
it, " said I.ee.
As the men passed through the doors,
Garretson, I.ee, Carter and Stone identi
fied each, to muke certain none hut
members of the genernl committee gaia
ed admission. The lust man wus inside
by 3 o'clock.
I.ntcr leaders of tho men announced
privately that President Wilson's pro
posal is primarily for an eight hour
day with postponement of less impor
tant matters until Inter. The men went
into caucus after leaving the White
House and lenders predicted they would
overwhelmingly accept the plan.
Wilson's proposals were characterized
us following substantially the line of
discussion in the press tho past few
days, though the United Press informant
indicated that both punitive overtime
and pro rata overtime was suggested for
luter disposition.
The president's proposition was very
short and what he read embodied the
granting of the eight hour day immedi
ately and the creation of a commission
by the president to be given full pow
ers of investigation of orln un uiiiin
crs of investiirntion by congress. The
commission would devote itself only to
investigation of the collateral issues, in
volved in the application of the eight
hour day to railroad operation, it was
stated on high authority, ,
After making his statement the presi
dent o'ffered the men the service of the
Kast room for balloting Wut they decid
ed it would be better to adjouru to
their hall.
An Apparent Deadlock.
Washington, Aug. 17 Reaching what
apparently was a deadlock in the at
tempted settlement of tho threatened
strike on the railroads, President Wil

Boseburg, Ore., Aug. 17. Charles E.

his transcontinental' trip. He was en

with only one Btop of more than a few
minutes scheduled for the day, at Shasta.
Springs tonight. Three or four points
wero scheduled to' hear the ; candidate
for a bare three or four minutes, but
no formal speeches had been arranged,
not even at Shasta Mpriugs.
A day of almost solid comfort was in
prospect for Hughes. Solid comfort, b

consists in a place to stretch out and
time in which to rest his mind by read

novels, to be exact. It is only a trifle

Worried Oyed Philippines.
. In his speech nt the Ice rink in Port
land last night, the candidate delivered
another broadside at the demo
cratic policies, concentrating his fire
particulnrly on the Philippines situa- '
tion. He declared that the United
States undertook to govern the islands
properly and that "we assumed obligsv
tioas there which we are bound to dis
charge." "Wo ought not to consider the sug
gestion of scuttling out of the Philip
pines," ho said, "to leave them in the
predicament which you know ver'eetly
well without my describing it. Hughes
again made a pronouncement on the tar
iff and attacked the administration's
nttitude. Asserting that the democratic
party has opposed real progress, he
said:
' "If I were a member of that party,
and lookeil through the platforms of the
past, I should feel that I was going
through a cemetery richly embellished
with monuments."
He declared that he wanted to see
the "empire of Alaska" developed
right.
"If I am charged with the high of
'f ice for which I am a candidate," he
concluded, "to put my principles to the
test, I am not afraid of that test. I
have no ambition to hold high office,
but I havo an ambition to try, so far
as within mo lies, to have efficient
