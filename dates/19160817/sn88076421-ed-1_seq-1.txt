SAVE EXHIBITS fOfi
MIDWINTER FAIR
It Is Not Too Early to Make Plans
for Your Exhibit for the
Annual Shoy.
The Association of Commerce wants
all the farmers of this vicinity to be­
gin now to save exhibits for the Mid-:
winter Fair this coming winter. It is
expected that a great deal of corn will
mature this fall, as the stand is all
that could be desired. Also the veg­
etables are exceptionally fine this
year, and there should be some splen­
did vegetaible exhibits available.
As outlined to some of our farmers
last winter, it would be a fine_ thing
for each farmer to have his individual
exhibit, that is, have the products of
his farm all together in a booth,
and
it goes without saying that a fine set
of prizes could be offered for the best
of these booth exhibits.
At the Panama-Pacific International
Exposition last year the exhibit of
the state of Virginia was composed of
grains, grasses and vegetables all
raised on one farm in that state.
The Montana exhibits were compos­
ed of individual exhibits from a num­
ber of farms, and each farmer win­
ning a prize or medal had the trophy
turned over to him at the close of the
exposition.
Last year a small admission fee was
charged during the Midwinter Fair,
and it was found that this plan work­
ed out well. Of course, those who had
exhibits at the fair were admitted free
every day of the fair, but those who
did not take enough interest to bring
any exhibits had to pay this small ad­
mission. The citizens of Minot also
paid this admission fee. The fee also
worked "well in that it precluded the
children of the city crowding the
building and interfering with the peo­
ple who were really interested in the
numerous exhibits. As stated, this
plan worked so well that during the
next fair and admission charge will
prevail, with the proviso that all who
exhibit will be admitted free all thru
the week.
Special attention will be also paid
to poultry, but there will be no other
live stock exhibited. last year the
poultry show made an excellent show
wig, and this coming year it is hoped
that many more people will exhibit
their fowls.
Therefore, we would respectfully
urge all the farmers of the Minot vi­
cinity to begin now to save up their
best exhibits as stated, and be ready
for the next Midwinter Fair.
NOT SECURES UN
EXPERT TRIMMER
L. M. Van Coutren, Who Has a Na­
tional Reputation, Will Arrive in
Minot Sept. 1.
L. M. Van Coutren will arrive in
Minot Sept. 1, to take charge of the
advertising, display work and mer­
chandising end of the game at the
McCoy Department store.
Mr. Van Coutren is now employed in
one of the large cities of Illinois but
wants to come west. C. E. DeNoon,
the manager of the store, has known
Mr. Van Coutren for a number of
years and considers that the store is
very fortunate in securing the services
of a man of his calibre. He has won a
national reputation as a window trim­
mer. He won the first prize in 1907
at Niagara Falls, for having trimmed
the best window in the United States.
His windows have been copied by
Marshall Field & Co., of Chicago. He
has had 18 years experience in the
business. His family will accompany
him to Minot to make their home
here.
Max Klang, who has held this posi­
tion for several months, goes to
Charleston, S. C.
Minot Dairy Ice Cream in Great De­
mand.
Under the managership of Peter
Miller the products of the Minot
Dairy arc in great demand this sea­
son. This concern has attained an en­
viable record among the leading
creameries of the state, their butter
scoring among the top notchers upon
several occasions when in competition
with the various creameries. Man­
ager Miller informs the Independent
that of late the demand for ice cream
has been unprecedented, and it has re­
quired some tall hustling to secure a
sufficient supply of fresh milk and
cream to meet the demand. This firm
makes a specialty of fancy brick ice
cream and the expert who has charge
of this department produces a delicacy
in this particular line that has no su­
perior.
M. E. Frettem Bought Larson Tailor­
ing Co. Shop.
M. E. Frettem has purchased the
tailoring business of Larson & Co. in
the Citizens Bank block and will con­
tinue the business under the style of
The Model Tailoring Co. The shop is
being remodeled, the workrooms occu­
pying a balcony above the salesroom.
Mrs. Frettem has resigned her posi­
tion with The Fair, where for the past
three years she has been in charge of
'V »1
the silk and dress goods department,
and will devote her time exclusively to
the ladies' tailoring department, which
will be operated in connection with her
husband's tailoring establishment. Mi­
not has long been in need of more
ladies' tailoring shops and this new
enterprise will fill a long felt want
in this particular. Mrs. Frettem en­
joys a wide acquaintance among the
ladies of the city and surrounding ter­
ritory and the shop will beyond a
doubt enjoy an extensive patronage.
Four tailors are now being employed,
dry cleaning being done in connection
with the regular work of the tailors.
This department is under the immed­
iate supervision of E. R. Brey, for­
merly in the employ of the Ideal Tail­
oring Co. of this city, which is suffic­
ient guarantee that this department
will be in capable hands. The new
firm starts under the brightest pros­
pects possible and we shall expect to
see it attain an eminent success.
MINOT MOTOR
SALES CO. DOING
ENORMOUSM
Although But a Short Time in Busi­
ness This Enterprising Firm Al­
ready Are in Front Ranks.
The Minot Motor Sales Company
are enjoying unprecedented business,
notwithstanding the fact that they
started in business at a time when
crop conditions were anything but fa­
vorable. The Oldsmobilc distributed
by this firm has met with instant pop­
ularity among those desiring a first
class car. They have already sold a
large number in this city and vicinity.
J. J. Kann, Harry Dingman, C. Aur
land and O. A. Malm of Minot and
Mrs. Schilling of Velva are among the
number who have recently invested in
C'ldsmobile cars. Their success in this
line Has been little short of phenom­
enal. At the present time the sales
force of the Minot Motor Sales Co.
are confining their attention to dem­
onstrating the superior merits of the
big four-plow Simplex tractor. This
tractor is peculiar in the fact that it
is manufactured by a concern who
manufacture tractors exclusively. Per­
haps no tractor on the market today
shows greater adaptability to the
farmers' needs than the Simplex. It
is a one man tractor and draws four
14 inch plows and costs $950 f. o. b.
the factory. In witnessing a demon­
stration of this tractor we were sur­
prised to note that one person can
easily push it about, the floor of the
salesroom, which shows the degree of
perfection manifest in, every appoint­
ment of this splendid machine. The
extreme care exercised in the con­
struction of this if also at­
tested by the fact tnat during the past
two years the manufacturers have
never been called upon to replace a
single transmission gear—something
noteworthy in tractor construction.
The Minot Motor Sales Company will
soon have a number of the Allwork
tractors in stock. This unique ma­
chine is the lightest and most power­
ful four wheel tractor, pulling three
plows, that can be obtained on the
market today. This tractor is said to
be the only tractor using kerosene as
fuel successfully, a point that will
recommend it to a public accustomed
to paying high prices for gasoline. It
is equipped with a four cylinder en­
gine it is simple in design, solid,
sturdy, compact, with no intricate
parts to confuse the operator. It
weighs but 4800 pounds and costs but
$975 f. o. b. factory.
The era of tractor farming is here
and here to stay. The large area
cultivated by the average farmer
makes the element of time a matter of
the greatest moment. The general
prevalence of wild oats and other nox­
ious weeds make deep plowing im­
perative, and the tractor seems to be
the only implement offering a satis­
factory solution under present condi­
tions.
Valet Buys New Studebaker Delivery
Car.
(?hrist Demopoulos, proprietor of
the Valet tailoring establishment in
the new Parker block, has purchased
a handsome new Studebaker delivery
car. It is beyond question the hand­
somest car of the kind in the city.
"Chris" says the best is none too good
for the Valet. Mr. Demopoulis estab­
lished his dry cleaning and dyeing shop
in this city late this spring and al­
ready his business has grown to such
proportions that he found a delivery
car essential as well as necessary in
the conduct of his business. His pat­
ronage is growing rapidly. This sum­
mer ne has made a specialty of clean­
ing straw and Panama hats, in con­
nection with his regular business of
cleaning and dyeing. He has been
very successful in this line as in the
others. His establishment in the new
Parker block is a model of its kind,
and here four workmen are regularly
employed in addition to two experts
who are kept busy at the dyeing and
cleaning plant located in another sec­
tion of the city, where there will be
no danger from fire, the regulations
requiring places of this kind to be
maintained beyond the fire limits. The
Valet Tailoring Co. have an announce­
ment in this issue of the Independent
which it would be well to clip from the
paper and preserve for future refer­
ence when in need of such service as
the Valet can render.

THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
LETTER FROM
(0. D. MEMBER
I'aul Hofacker Writes About Life at
Mercedes—Says Bill of Fare is
tirawing Better.
Judge Leighton received an inter­
esting letter from Paul N. Hofacker,
of the Northern Telephone Co., who is
along the Mexican border with Co. D.
He said: "We've got quite a camp
down here, located on the edge of
'City of Mercedes,' which is a combi­
nation of Texas land boom and border
town population, about seven-sixths
Mexicans. You have no doubt heard
of the Mercedes coast. It irrigates a
'piece' of country down here. The
Minnesota, Nebraska, Indiana and Il­
linois troops are camped about three
miles from here, but as far as location
goes, it does not compare with ours.
They have about 17,000 troops alto­
gether.
"The proposition of getting accli­
mated worked rather hard on some of
the boys after living on 'canned horse'
for five days on the train, together
with about two watermelons per man,
which could be purchased at about ten
cents each. After arriving in camp,
we enjoyed about six days of the
same kind of stuff, mostly canned
meats and crackers, no bread, ice, and
not even prunes. Things are better
now and the boys are coming around
O. K. We get about four hours drill
four days a week, a ten mile hike on
Friday and nothing to do Saturday
and Sunday except wash and go to
church.
"Of course, the chance for glory is
past now, but it isnt' a bad life a:
tViat—if they don't keep us too long.
I can easily imagine why a regular
army man is what he is. Say 'Hello'
to all the fellows. We are making up
the long delayed pay rolls today. The
boys have been broke since the first
iwo or three days at Lincoln, so pay
day will be quite welcome."
Halsey Tailoring Co. Now C. L. Cran
dall Co.
Manager C. L. Crandall of the Hal­
sey Tailoring Co., has changed the
name of his establishment and it is
now known as the C. L. Crandall Co.,
Tailors, Cleaners and Dyers. Mr.
Crandall has recently engaged the
services of A. Anderson of Minneapo­
lis, an expert in this particular line.
The Crandall establishment is one of
the leading establishments of this
character in the city and the firm en­
joys a wide patronage.
TAYLOR'S SHORTHAND
SCHOOL WILL OPEN
Miss Leona Taylor, sister of Frank
P. Taylor, the well known druggist,
will manage the school, where the fol­
lowing courses will be taught: Short­
hand, typewriting, spelling, shorthand
penmanship, business English and of­
fice training.
Miss Taylor is not a stranger in
this city. She was well known here in
the early days when she held a home­
stead in old Ward county, teaching
school in the county a number of years
ago. She studied stenography in Mi­
not, after which she attended the Nor­
mal session, securing a teachar's di­
ploma at the Gregg school, Chicago,
the headquarters of the Gregg short­
hand system. She was then offered
a position in this school, teaching
there two years, where she learned
Mr. Gregg's methods of teaching. She
also taught two years in the Lincoln
Business College, Lincoln, Neb., a
school which enrolls between five and
six hundred students annually. She
has also taught in the Minneapolis
Business College, and last year was
connected with the St. Cloud, Minn.,
Business College. Miss Taylor's train­
ing has been the very best and the
Taylor Shorthand School ought to be
a rapidly growing institution.
It will accupy a number of rooms in
the front of the Fair block, an ideal
location.
Attorney Stenersen of Parshall Here.
V. E. Stenersen motored over from
Parshall yesterday. Mr. Stenersen
says that crops on the reservation are
much better than those he passed on
his way into the city. There will be
an immense acreage of flax on the
reservation this year and that crop
is looking excellent. A large percent­
age of the harvesting is being done
with tractors. He mentioned seeing
one tractor pulling a self binder with a
gang plow hitched behind. Evident­
ly the Campbell system has its advo­
cates among the new settlers in that
section.
Dr. Myklestad Writes From Germany.
Dr. J. Semple of this city received
a letter from Dr. Myklestad this week
which had been mailed June 28. The
letter bore the stamp of the censor,
which may account for the delay in
its receipt. Dr. Myklestad writes
that he is enjoying an exceptional op-

po^tunity in the study of what are
known as plastic operations. He is
connected with a clinic at Berlin. Un­
doubtedly the knowledge that his corn
implication would be censored had
something to do with coloring his
statements but he wrote that living
expenses were cheaper in Berlin than
nuthe states. He has first class ac­
commodations at a hotel and his room
costs but $1.00 per day. He mention­
ed^ a dinner of roast goose which he
enaoyed the day he wrote, saying the

thi|it he would continue his studies a
couple of months longer, when he
w^uld return to his old home in Nor­
way before returning to the Unite

to§ the effect that he will never be
caught voting the Democratic ticket
when he gets back home. The pres­
ent administration he says is consider­
ed in the light of amused contempt in
Germany.
SCOTS ENJOY
5 MERRY PICNIC
Biirns Club Held Annual Picnic at Oak
Park Wednesday Interesting
Program Rendered.
A merry company of Scots, mem­
bers of the Minot Burns club, gathered
al£ beautiful Oak Park in the western
part of the city Wednesday afternoon
fdr their annual summer picnic.
An interesting program was render­
ed during the afternoon. President
Win. Hetherton Sr. read letters from
Norman B. Black and Governor Han
ra. who sent their regrets at their in­
ability to share in the festivities. Each
paid a glowing tribute to the memory
of the late Colonel Scarlett, whose ab­
sence wis felt by one and all.
N. C. MacDonald of Valley Cty, who
has charge of the rural school exten­
sion work in North Dakota, gave a de­
lightful talk on a six months' sojourn
in Scotland. Rev. Mr. MacMullen of
Rochester, Minn., gave a splendid talk
on Bums and Dr. A. J. McCannel told
one of his best Scotch stories. Pres­
ident Hetherton sang a number of
Scotch songs in his rich baritone voice
and Mrs. ¥m. Murray delighted all
$rtth a Scotch reading. The program
ended with prayer, led by Mrs. John
Campbell.
Secretary Stewart was exceedingly
busy thruout the afternoon, and es­
pecially so during the lunch hour,
when haggis, scones and other tempt­
ing Scotch dishes were served. Wm.
Mfcjray presided at the ice cream can
in a mahner that denoted generosity.
The picnic was successful in every
way.
Young Woman Took Picture of Glen
burn Cyclone.
Dick Barrett of Glenburn brot to
this office a picture of the twister
which operated north of Glenburn,
Wednesday evening of last week. The
picture was taken by a young woman
who evidently had plenty of nerve, for
she could not have been more than a
mile away from the cyclone at the
time. The funnel-shaped cloud is
plainly shown.
The storm fortunately did not do a
great deal of damage, for it missed the
best buildings. Its path was eight
miles long and two blocks wide. It
dipped down and took fences and
grain fields along its way. Shocks
were carried away from the John
Sharpe farm. The house on the Pe
tras homestead was carried away and
as the funnel crossed the tracks, it
tore up the telephone and telegraph
wires. At the Marean farm, the gran­
ary was twisted from its cement foun­
dation and the shocks from a forty
acre field of rye disappeared. Nick
Roles' wind mill was twisted out of
shape and twenty fence posts were
jerked out, and the wire twisted into
a mass. At the Winderl farm, the
cyclone made a hole in the earth 35
feet long, 15 feet wide and afoot and
a half deep. At Ray Anderson's place
it dug big holes in his pasture, while
a deep hole was made on the John
Hake farm, filled with remnants of
wind mills, bricks, posts, iron, wire
and a lot of straw and water.
At the H. H. Marean farm the
chimney was torn from the house and
all the windows in the west side of the
house were broken. Chairs were car­
ried out of the rooms upstairs. The
storm was preceded by hail, all crops
being destroyed in the Tom Willis
neighborhood. The hail stones were
unusually large. Several of the larg­
est ones were measured and they were
ten inches around one way and eleven
inches the other. Two hours after the
storm, hail stones as large as hen's
eggs were found.
The storm came up about four o'­
clock in the afternoon, hundreds
watching it form in the sky.
Winters in New York.
The Independent received a post
card from H. L. Winters, the jeweler,
who is buying stock for the Winters
Jewelry Store in New York city He
said he had been shopping all week
long, finding some of the prettiest
novelties, both in glass and silver, he
has ever seen. The store will have
the finest lines this fall it ever car­
ried. Mr. Winters spent a day in
Philadelphia and hobnobbed with the
"four hundred" at Atlantic City last
Sunday.
LECTURE FOR
MINOT AUTO OWNERS
Henry H. Hower, Noted Engineer, to
Talk With Motion Pictures
at Grand Theatre.
Minot motor car owners and motor
car drivers within a radius of one
hundred miles of here, will have the
opportunity on Tuesday, August 22nd,
to see at close range the mechanism
and operation of an automobile motor.
This was announced yesterday by I„
C. Stearns of the Minot Auto Com­
pany. Mr. Stearns has secured Henry
H. Hower of the Society of Automo­
bile Engineers to lecture on the
Knight sleeve valve motor at the
Grand Theatre.
"It was not until yesterday," said
Mr. Stearns, "that definite arrange
ments for Mr. Mower's appearance in
Minot were completed. Now that pre
liminary arrangements have been
made, we are going ahead with the
preparations for an elaborate program
which we believe will long be remem­
bered by motor car owners in this part
of the state.
"Mr. Hower's lecture is in no sense
a technical talk. With the aid of mo
tion pictures and stationary slides
produced under his supervision, Mr.
I Hower brings out vividly, every ponit
concerning the construction of an au­
tomobile motor."
"Mr. Hower tells the audience that
carbon deposits are actually beneficial
to a Knight motor and with the aid of
his motion pictures, he backs up his
statement by showing that the sleeve
in the motor is so constructed as to
gather carbon.
"The lecturer will tell of the early
struggles and other triumphs of Chas.
Y. Knight, the American inventor of
the sleeve valve motor. He will re­
count how after years of bitter dis­
appointments in this country Mr.
Knight went to Europe, where the
Daimler Company finally agreed to
try out his invention. That was'about
eight years ago and today twenty
three European automobile manufac­
turers equip their cars with the
Knight sleeve valve motor. Today the
King of England and the Emperor of
I Germany may not agree on matters
,of state, but they do agree on auto­
mobile construction, both drive
Knight motored cars."
In addition to the lecture itself,
there will be a program consisting of
vocal and instrumental music. One
feature of the entertainment will be
an animated song in the form of a mo­
tion picture, the scenario of which
.was written around a catchy rag-time
air.
Mr. Stearns, on the evening of the
lecture, will entertain at dinner deal­
ers in the Minot territory.
NEW MILLINER
AT MOTS
Miss Strausenback, Experienced Mil*
«liner in Large Cities, in Charge
of Department.
Miss Strausenback, a milliner who
has had experience in her work in
Winnipeg, El Paso, St. Louis and a
number of othpr large cities, has been
secured by the McCoy Department
Store as manager and designer in the
millinery department.
Miss C. E. Smith, who held this po­
sition for a number of years, resigned
recently, as she is opening a millinery
store of her own in the east.
Miss Strausenback will arrive Mon­
day and it is expected that she will
soon have an interesting announce­
ment to make to the public. She comes
very highly recommended and wili
make a record in this department of
one of the state's largest stores.
I. W. W. ARGUMENT RE­
SULTS IN SHOOTING
Nelson Forrester, a transient labor­
er, shot Pete Pietrick of Wolford in
the right side. The bullet struck a rib
and came out of his back without do­
ing any serious injury. Forester was
arrested but will be turned free as
his victim does not desire to prose­
cute. The men had had an argument
over the I. W. W. situation, which
brot on the shooting.
Mr. Horton, of the Horton Motor
Co., of Fargo, was in the city this
week on business. It is altogether
likely that Mr. Horton will soon move
to this city as Minot is more nearly
in the center of his business territory.
GETTING RID OF WILD OATS.
(By W. A. Peck.)
Where wild oats have seeded them­
selves this year:
First—Shallow plow and harrow thio
fall (1916).
Second—Plow five or six inches deep
in late spring after the wild oats have
come up and seed to barley. (Spring
1917).
Third—Follow the barley with rye,
seeding on stubble, preferably righ*
behind the binder, without disking,
(fall 1917).
Fourth—Double disc, or shallow
plow rye stubble in fall (1918).
Fifth—Replow five or six inches
deep ir. late spring after volunteer rye
and wild oats have come up and seed
to barley (spring 1919).
Another method:
First—Shallow plow and harrow
this fall (1916).
Second—Seed to oats or barley early
in the spring to be cut for hay while
wild oats are green.
Third—Plow five or six inches deep
as soon as possible after hay is re­
moved. Prepare ground for seeding
rye sometime in August (1917).
Fourth—Double disc or* shallow
plow rye stubble in fall (1918).
Fifth—Replow five or six inches
deep in late spring after rye and wild
oats have come up and seed to barley
(spring 1919).
The above methods may fail if the
following fall and spring are too dry
to germinate the wild oats. In such
a case in the first method the land
may be summerfallowed the last of
June or the barley, if seeded too late
to mature, may be cut for hay.
C. L. Mathews, of Campbell, Minn.,
Met Death Monday Evening—in
Sight of Other Bathers.
C. L. Mathews, a transient painter
from Campbell, Minn., met death in
Mouse river at Wildwood park about
seven o'clock Monday evening. Tha
body was recovered within fifteen min­
utes and altho doctors worked over
him with pulmotors, life could not be
restored. The remains were taken to
a local undertaking establishment and
the body prepared for shipment to the
old home, where the parents, each of
whom is past 70 years of age, reside.
Mn Mathews and A. L. Cross were
touring the country in an auto. When
near Minot, their machine broke down
and they brot it to the city for re­
pairs. While waiting for the repairs,
they camped out at Wildwood and in
the evening, joined the body of camp­
ers from Idlewild Camp, and went in
bathing. Mathews, who was forty
years of age and single, remarked that
he had not been in swimming for six­
teen years, but he was urged to go
into the stream by Mr. Cross. The
party of bathers were having a great
deal of sport, splashing the water
over each other, when a woman on the
bank noticed that Mathews was in per­
il. He was seen to be sinking, his
arms being waved above the surface.
None of the bathers were good swim­
mers. but Cross tied a rope about him­
self and made a frantic effort to save
his friend. The body sank in about
ten feet of water.
The fire department was notified
and the truck with Chief O'Leary,
Henry Slocum. Chester Jacobson and
Keith Thompson made a record run.
The firemen threw off their clothing
and at the first dive, Henry Slocum lo­
cated the body. He dived again and
brot the body to the surface. Doctore
were soon on hand with two rmlmotors
and worked for nearly an hour over
the man, without success. It is be
luved that he died from heart failure.
The water was rather cool and the
man was not used to bathing in a
stream.
Chief of Police Dougherty phoned
to the parents that evening and ar­
rangements were made to ship the re­
mains to Minnesota.
Mr. Cross feels very badly over the
accident. He and Mathews were boys
on a farm in Minnesota, living close
neighbors for years. Mr. Mathews
was a fine fellow. He was an Odd
Fellow, a K. P., Maccabee and Wood­
man.
Visit From Iowa Contractor.
W. C. Carpenter, of Newton, Iowa,
arrived to spend six weeks with his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Carpen­
ter. A. L. Carpenter is building a fine
home in this city and the son, who has
had twelve years experience in the
contracting business, will have charge
of the work while here.
Mr. Carpenter comes from one of
the busiest little cities in Iowa, which
has a population of 5,000. Newton
boasts of a large number of factories,
twelve different washing machines, in
eluding the One-Minute washer, being
made there. An advertising novelty
works employs 400 girls, and the Par­
sons ditching machine, band cutter
and self feeder are manufactured
there. Crops are fair in Iowa, late
rains saving the corn crop. 5
New Masseur at Turkish Bath Parlors
Edward O'Donnel, a professional
masseur from the famous Andrew Ho­
tel Baths In Minneapolis^ has arrived
to take charge of the Turkish bath
parlors at Erickson's barber shop.
These baths are the best in North Da­
kota. They are perfectly sanitary.
The place is kept nice and quiet and
the patronage is very large. When a
Turkish bath with bed costs only $1.50
the public should not overlook a good
bet.
Old Scout Visits Minot.
Charlie Lewis, better known as
"Dad" Lewis, arrived from Whitefish,
Mont., this week to visit at the home
of his sister, Mrs. E. A. Dunn. "Dad"
Lewis was a resident of old Ward
county, out along the Missouri, for
years. He was one of the best known
trappers and hunters in the west for
years and in the early days was a
