This store never wab-

We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the x
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value.

ENCAMPMENT IS
GREAT SUCCESS
GRANGERS FOR RURAL PROGRESS
Mea of Prominence Deliver Address-
Billy Sunday Closes Event With
Sermon Against Ram
With total attendance of 600 at the
different meetings, tee number! for
pleasure and business of the program
of the first annual Hood Kiver County
Pomona Orange encampment were
brought to a successful close Saturday
night. Since last Tuesday evening the
members of the five granges of the
county, moat of them temporarily dom
iciled in a city of tents in a magnifi
cent fir grove about bu yards from
Parkdale station and the large Mclaaac
hall, where Upper Valley meetings are
held, have forgotten the routine chores
of farm life and participated in sports,
dances, and musical and dramatic en
tertainments and have listened to
addresses touching on the betterment
of rural life from the lips of prominent
men of Oregon. As a result or the
week's session Hood River rural
schools, rural churches and farm life
generally will reflect a trend of devel
opment throughout the year to come.
"It has been the best camp meeting
that 1 have ever attended, says Dr.
Hector McPberson, of the Oregon
Agricultural College, "who addressed
the grangers yesterday afternoon,
"and it has been to me a concrete
evidence of the co-operation that
exists here among you people of the
Hood River valley. President W. J.
Kerr, of O. A. C, who motored up
from Portland with bis family Friday
over the uoiumoia Kiver mgnway.
talked to the vacationists Saturday
afternoon. Others who have addressed
the grangers have been: Talk on
rural education. Miss Mary Frasier;
"Books and Reading for Children,"
Miss Alice See. Hood River county
librarian: address. Prof. L. B. Gibson,
county school superintendent ; lecture,
C. fci. apence, master oi Oregon Mate
Grange; "Betterment of Rural Schools
and Consolidation," J. A. Churchill,
state superintendent of education;
Wild Birds and Their Habitat."
W. L. Finley, state biologist; original
readings, Anthony Euwer, New York
author : talk of boys and girls' indus
trial club work, C. J. Seymour, of the
O. A. C. extension department; talk
on co-operative marketing, by C. J.
Hurd; and "Problems of the Parent,"
Mrs. Geo. A. McMath, of Portland,
president of the Oregon Mother's
Congress.
Sneakers and members or the granges
at their encampment expressed a strong
opposition to the proposed bill, provid
ing for the limited manufacture of
beer in Oregon, but one of the moat
unexpected actions of the meeting was
a resolution in disapproval of the pro
posed measure advocated by C. C.
Chapman, of Portland, who proposes
that the license tax of Oregon motor
cars be increased to raise a fund for
road building. Most of the grange
members rode to the encampment in
their automobiles.
The grangers adopted a resolution
endorsing the action of Representative
N. J. Sinnott in bis efforts to secure
for Oregon reclamation work a 40 per
cent of the Oregon land grant funds.
The address of Miss frasier dealt
with conservation. The conservation
of our material resources, she declared,
are important enough, but of much
greater importance is that of the
country's children. Miss Frazier told
her audience that the sum or $o,uuu,uuu
was spent annually in the conservation
of youth. "Over twice this amount,
she said, "is spent in reclaiming young
men and women who have gone wrong.
This is a mistake of our social system
that should be remedied, for we should
make our conservation work of such a
nature that the boys and girls would
not go wrong."
She recommended that children be
given something practical to hold their
interest. That they should be made to
feel both at home and in school that
they are responsible citizens.
Miss See gave an excellent talk on
books for vounzer children.
Prof. Gibson, whose subject was
"Politics and Pumpkins," said the
pumpkin was used as a characterization
or rural spirit. He urged that country
people perfect their co-operative oper
ations and make them more efficient.
He called attention to the trend of
population to drift to the cities.
"Country people," be declared, "should
make it possible for their organizations
to pull together for rural interests."
According to Prof. Gibson, rural Amer
ica is not properly represented in
legislative bodies. He suggested that
farmers have a legislative committee
with which candidates, as in the case
of commercial and business organiza
tions, might consult and learn the
wishes of country people.
F. M. Gill, of Dufur, candidate for
the joint senatorship from Hood River
and Wasco counties, told the grangers
of his plnas for road building.
State Master u. c. spence urgea me
members of granges to become imbued
with a more fraternal spirit. He took
uo the Question of road building and
declared that road construction was so
much in the experimental stage that
extreme care should be practiced in
establishing definite plans.
The address of J. A. unurcniu. stste
superintendent of education, was in
teresting tnrougnout. nr. nurcnui
called attention to the fact that Hood
River county pays its teachers the
highest average sarlaies and offers the
longest terms oi scnoois oi any county
in Oregon.
Prof. Seymour, of the extension
denartment of the Oregon Agricultursl
College, discussed the industrial clubs
of bovs and girls. Mr. Seymour cited
instancea or scnooi iaira to snow tnat
the extension department waa incul
eating in the youths of the state a
sense of practical business and thrift.
He told oi a iair last year, wnere swine
were entered in a contest. Everybody
thoueht a bov who bed exhibited an
extra fine big white hog would be prize
winner. But when the premium was
awarded a boy with not so beautiful a
soecimen was the fortunate youth
While the do? wud toe woue nog
showed that he was in debt 116 on the
raisins of bis big pig. the winner
showed a net profit of $7.
One of the most appealing of all the
talks at the encampment waa that of
Dr. Hector McPherson. of O. A. C,
Mr. McPherson. quoting Albion Small,
named the following six points that an
individual mutt have; health, wealth,
sociability, knowledge, beauty and
Tightness qualification of religious
interest.
Dr. McPherson declared that the
people of Hood River county have
great advantages in that they were
privileged to behold daily the most
wonderful scenery in the world. He
urged the conservation of roadside
trees. Bow often, according to hia
declarations, do the people of the
country allow their beautiiul and var
iable trees to be sacrificed and permit
defacing billboards to tske their place.
Dr. McPherson urged that the inter
ior of homes also be beautified. For
a trifle, he declared, the farmer'a wife
may purchase reproductions of the
world a masters.
Dr. McPberson gave a talk to the
grangers again Sunday morning.
Sunday afternoon there was a gath
ering of the clana from all parts of the
valley to hear Billy Sunday clinch the
argument against old John Barleycorn.
i be attendance at this meeting was
larger than at any other session of the
grangers.

made a great many supporters by his
masterly ripping asunder of the conten
tions of Mr. Uren.
"I believe that 'not 10 per cent of
those filling the crowded hall would
have voted for Mr. Uren at the close
of the meeting," says J. F. Tnomp-
son," who was here Monday.
Wednesday night a fine exhibition
drill was given by a Parkdale team.
New members were initiated into the
Pomona grange.

editor of the Grange Bulletin, who ad
dressed the grangers. Mrs. Bond,
President Kerr and family, Dr. Mc
Pherson and other visitors all declared
that they would be present at the
meeting of next year.
HIGHWAY FAME EX
TENDS TO SOUTH
The fame of the Columbia River
highway has extended to the Sunny
South, according to Tolman Tbomison,
of Fayetteville, Tenn., who has arrived
here for a visit with nis Drotner, joe
D. Thomison. to fish in mid-Columbia
streams and to study methods of apple
tree cultivation.
'You people of the Northwest are to
be congratulated on the way you con
duct your publicity campaigns. Mult
nomah r ails, wown Point and a num
ber of other points of the Columbia
highway have become familiar to us
people of the South. We have seen
pictures of them in leading publica
tions and scenes of the road have been
shown in the movies.
"Perhaps you haven t beard so much
about them, but we, too, have been
doing some highway work, and the
Dixie and Jackson highways, travers
ing Kentucky and Tennessee, bid fair
to become as well known longitudinal
routes as is the Lincoln highway cross
ing the country from coast to coast.
The motor car has worked an evolution.
Yankees have motored down among us
and we have journeyed in our automo
biles up to tbe Northland, and we of
Dixieland have learned that the Yan
kees are human beinga not much differ
ent from us, and they have found out
the same things about us.
'But your campaign of pupliclty is
going to be valuable. 1 know of a
dozen families at least who are plan
ning automobile trips across tbe conti
nent next year, in order thatt they see
at first band your wonderfully acenic
country."
Mr. Tbomison declares that the
Notrhweat has set a standard for fruit
raisers of the South.
Apples from Hood River and other
Northwestern sections, shipped into
southern distributing points and sold
throughout all the country," he says,
have done more toward spurring
growers there toward the production of
a better fruit man any otnerone thing.
Orchardists have learned the value of
spraying and the necessity of packing
their fruit attractively, wnne some
of the highlands of my state are well
adapted to the production of a fine
duality of apples, weather conditions
make the industry very uncertain.
Frosts and late freezes kill the young
applea or blight the blooms too ol ten
for tbe raising of apples to be highly
profitable."
Columbia Traveled by Skiff
Prof. W. D. Lyman, of Whitman col
lege, passed through Hood River last
week, traveling down tbe Columbia
river in a skiff. Prof. Lymsn is well
acouainted with the Columbia. He is
author of a book dealing with the ec
centricities of the current of the great
"Wauna."
HOOD RIVER TO
HAVESOLDIERS
COAST ARTILLERY CO. IS ASSURED
Major Wilson Here From Portland Last
Week Sees Spirit That Will
Lead to Success
Major W. W. Wilson, of Portland,
last Friday gave Hood River county
young men the assurance of a company
in the Coast Artillery of Oregon, and
according to present plsns, the new
company, with a minimum of 75 mem
bers, will be formally mustered in next
Monday evening.
Major Wilson addressed a party of
young men of both city and valley and
business men at the Commercial club
at noon, and Friday afternoon be visit
ed with professional and business men.
Hood River, according to the officer's
statements, while other towns have put
in previous applications for the com
pany, has secured the organization be
cause of the Jkeen interest evidenced,
not only among those who will actively
particpate. but on the part of the con
servative business element of the Ap
ple Valley.
"After talking with your business
men," said the visitor, "I immediately
felt that I could assure you of success
for the company. You've got the spirit
that it will take to make a company of
Coast Artillery a live organization.
The new company will be formed
around a nucleus of 45 young ranchers
of the EaBt Side orchard district, who
several weeks ago informally signed
papers and petitioned for the organiza
tion. Chief among the men working
for the company have been Ned Van
Horn, of the East Side, and Dr. F. C.
Brosius, major in the Oregon medical
reserve.
It is likely that a list of 100 or more
will sign the formal applications, but
it is expected that failure to stand
physical tests will disbar some. The
remainder of the company will be sup
plied by Dee, Parkdale and city boys.
Bright and early Monday morning
Geo. R. Wilbur, of the city, and repre
sentatives in the Dee and Parkdale
districts began the work of formally
signing prospective members of the
artillery company. Every prospect is
fair for more than 100 charter mem
bers. Dr. F. C. Brosius will be busy this
week making physical examinations of
the recruits.
GROWER GRIVEANCES
EXPLAINED AWAY
The grievances of Upper Valley and
Dee Flat strawberry growers, who
came here Monday to eonfer with board
of directors and officials of the Apple
Growers Association and lay before
them their complaints, disappeared af
ter a lengthy session at which the Bales
agency officials explained the season's
strawberry deal to tbe visiting delega
tions. The conference lasted through
out the morning until the middle of the
sfternoon without a recess for lunch.
The growers claimed in instancea that
they had received during the first of
July but 60 cents per crate for their
fruit, a sum 40 cents less than the cost
of production and harvest. They main
tained that the sales organization
should have warned them against pick
ing the fruit, when a clear loss might
have been expected.
It was explained by the sales officials
that the losses were incurred during
the week of the Fourth, the Tuesday
following Sunday. For four days, it
was declared the fruit trade was at a
standstill, and berries remaining over
that time in cars moulded because of
the prevailing rains of the valley. W.
M. Dickerson, a sales representative of
the Association, told the growers that
the fruit might have been a total loss
but for the action on the part of the
Association repacking the berries. Tbe
average sales of the Association dur
ing the past season have been highly
satisfactory.
After the meeting ' says J. K. bd-
gar, "we feel that our Association did
tbe best for us.
Other growers here to attend the
conference were : Henry Steinhauser,
W. I. Mason, A. C. Sallenbach, W. I.
Kirby, S. G. Emilio, W. F. Shannon,
L. r. Parker, Luhr Jensen and Anton
Flint.
Concrete Paving Lasts Well
Comment has recently been made as
to the possible life of Hood River con
crete pavements. R. E. Scott recently
received tbe following letter Irom
Detroit. Michigan, from the Wayne
County Good Roads commission relative
to concrete pavements there, and the

local men:
'The concrete roads in Wayne county
are standing up in nrst class manner.
They are free from ruts and holes
and by the end of this year there will
be over one hundred and fifty miles of
concrete roads in this county. The
oldest of these concrete roads in this
county are in their eighth year of wear
and give every appearance of having a
long life.
'Wayne county this year win spena
upwards of $450,000 on building con
crete roads in the county. The road
autboritiea here have practically aban
doned tbe construction of every other
type of road due to tbe excellent ser
vice tbe concrete nas given.
