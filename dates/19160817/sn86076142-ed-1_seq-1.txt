WASHINGTON, August 17. As a
step in the direction of hit) desire to
reach the "ultimate authority," both
aides with whom he wishes to deal

the threatened strike of the four

In response to the Invitation many
presidents are hurrying from all parts
of the country, even the Pacific

The president declared that if the
presidents of the railroads are unable
to speak absolutely for their roads
ha will Invite to the White House

RAILROAD PRESIDENTS
ACCEPT INVITATION
I By Aaaorlatrd Prm.l
NEW YORK, August 17. The
railroad presidents have accepted
the presidunt's invitation to visit
and confer with him on the rail-
road strike situation. Many left
this afternoon and others depart
for Chicago tomorrow.
hour day, but are willing to arbitrate
that question and others before any
tribunal the president or men decide
upon. The men are willing to arbi
trate some questions under certain
conditions, but are not willing to
arbitrate others.
Some . of the union leaders are
planning to meet the demand of the
railroads for arbitration by Insisting
to the president that 75 more lines
for which the managers have no
authority to speak be included In the
negotiations. Tbus the old dispute

between the managers and brother
hoods is reopened and probably re
sult in an inquiry into the ownership
and control of these roads.
Investigation will prove, the em
ployes' representatives insist, that
the larger roads for which the man
agers are acting control a majority
of the smaller lines.
The railroad presidents are ex
pected to make a strong plea for the
principle of arbitration and will ex
press the fear that, if the present
difficulty cannot be settled without
arbitration, there is little hope of
being successful in the future.
This afternoon the 640 union chair
men conferred with the president in
the east room of the White House
where they marched in a body. They
heard the president's plan without
demonstration and went to tbeic. ball
to discuss and vote on the plan.-
An indication of the delicacy of
the situation is seen in the decision
not to make public the president's
statement to men and managers. It
was intended to give out public state
ments, thus laying the case before
the high court of public opinion.
