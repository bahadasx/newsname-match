TO ASK COURT
TO INSURE CAPE
FRISCO CLAIMS
Knehans Wants Franchise
Upheld Before Road's Sale
Is Approved.
PETITION IS BASED
UPON TENNESSEE CASE
City Counselor to Leave For St.
Louis Conference
Tomorrow.
Federal Judge Sanborn of the
United States District Court will be
asked by the City of Cape Girardeau
to both define and secure the rights of
the city under its franchise with the
Frisco Railroad, before he approves
the recent sale of the road to the group
of Eastern capitalists.
City Counselor O. A. Knehans early
tomorrow morning will depart for St.
Louis where he will have a conference
with George B. Webster, attorney re
tained by the Commercial Club to aid
in prosecuting the case of the city
against the Frisco.
Mr. Knehans yesterday afternoon
declared that because the city now is
on record as notifying the purchasers
of the road that the city expects the
franchise to be maintained, the way is
open for a new intervening petition of
the character which he will file.
Judge Sanborn will take up the sale
of the Frisco August 29 when a mo
tion for the sale's approval will come
before the court. Other unsecured
creditors of the road who hold bonds
of the Cape Girardeau & Northern
Railway also have filed a petition seek
ing to have the sale quashed until def.
inite arrangements are made for tak
ing care of unsecured creditors.
The petition which will be filed by
the City of Cape Girardeau is based
upon an opinion of the U. S. Circuit
Court of Appeals which held that un
der similar circumstances in Tennes
see, the court may define and secure
the rights of a city under a franchise.
This case is a suit between the State
of Tennessee and Quintard, and Judges
Taft, Clark and Lurton held that un
der circumstances parallel to the Cape
Frisco situation, the court could order
the franchise contract maintained.
The Cape stands in the position of
an unsecured creditor with reference
to the Frisco Railroad. The sea wall
that was to have been constructed, the
new station and favorable freight
rates all have been neglected by the
Frisco and the city is now seeking to
have the Court order an absolute main
tenance of the franchise before the
Frisco sale is approved.
FIGHT ON MAIN STREET
Whitener Arrests W. H. Coggins and
Llovd Reese After Fisticuffs.
Patrolman Arthur C. Whitener last
nigt arrest ed W. H. Coggins and Lloyd
Reese, both of the Cape, following a
fist fight in which the two men en
gaged about 8 o'clock at Main and
Themis street. ; Tm
Neither of the combatants succeed
ed in injuring his opponent, although
they fought for several minutes before
Whitener arrived on the scene and
caught them. A large crowd gather
ed to watch the men fight. The cause
of the fight was unknown, but it was
said they had been quarreling for some
time during the evening.
Coggins is the man who got out a
warrant last week against Ed Arms,
whom he accuses of shooting at him in
a fight in Smelterville.
Reese remained in jail for the night,
but Coggins was able to furnish bail,
and was released.
BIRD STAYS BY NEST
IN GREAT BOMBARDMENT
London, Aug. 16. A British staff
officer writes:
"A blackbird's nest with three young
birds in it was found in the ruins of
a village which had been captured by
us some days previous.
"This particular village is situated
practically right on the old German
front line, and thus the old bird must
have sat on its nest during the whole
of the preliminary bombardment and
the subsequent terrific fighting. Every
thing around the nest was smashed to
atoms."

JACKSON HUNTS
BABOON HIDING
IN CORN FIELD
Monkey, Belonging to Home
Comers' Carnival, Escaped
During Storm.
TWO ARE CAPTURED
AFTER WILD CHASE
Three Day Pageant Opens Coun
ty seat Today To be
Record.
"Bill," the baboon, which broke
away from a concession on the Pike at
the carnival which is showing at the
Jackson Homecomers' celebration, is
still at large. He was chased into a
cornfield at the edge of the county seat
yesterday afternoon, where he disap
peared. H. S. Smith, manager of the carnival
company, informed the tribune last
night that "Lizzie" and her son,
"Tom," two monkeys that escaped with
"Bill," were captured yesterday after
noon.
The baboons, which became fright
ened at the storm Tuesday night, broke
out of their cage and fled into the sub
urbs. Their absence was not discover,
ed until yesterday morning.
The three monkeys represented a
whole family. "Bill" is the head of the
family, and "Lizzie" is his wife.
"Tom," a lad of ten months, is their
only offspring. The parent monkeys
are devoted to their boy, and they re
sent any attempt to tease him. While
the three were at large, Mr. Smith
feared that the old monkeys might at
tack some of the men and boys who at
tempted to capture them yesterday.
The mother and son remained to
gether and defied capture for 12 hours.
Finally "Tom's" hunger forced him to
give in. When Mr. Smith entered the
cornfield yesterday afternoon and yell
ed: "Tommy, I have some peanuts for
you," the young monkey could not re
sist the temptation to eat, and he
scampered out of the corn thicket and
screamed pleasantly at his master.
While he was enjoying a peanut
feast, Mr. Smith had some men carry
the big monkey cage from the conces
sion on the pike to the cornfield, and
when "Tom" had finished his lunch,
Smith urged the little baboon to go
into the cage.
"Tom" looked into the big box, but
upon finding the family away, he re
fused to enter. "'Lizzie, go into your
house and behave yourself!" shouted
Smith in a tone that indicated "Liz
zie" was watching him. To his sur
prise, the mother emerged from the
corn and entered the cage.
Then Mr. Smith called loudly for
"Bill," but he refused to respond. A
posse of about 500 boys and girls was
then organized and the hunt for the
elusive monkey began. "Bill" saw
them coming and ran into the middle
of the field and hid. When darkness
overtook the pursuers, the baboon was
still missing. Another hunt will be
made today.
The carnival concessions were run
ning full blast last night, with several
thousand people present, although the
pageant formally opens today. It is
by far a more elaborate exhibition
than on previous years, and unless all
predictions go awry, it will break all
records for attendance.
SEIZE BEAUTIFUL SPY
AT AMERICAN BALL
G?neva, Aug. 16. Two dramatic in
cidents marked the great ball and con
cert given by the American colony in
Lausanne in behalf of the fund for
the Allied prisoners of war and the
invalid Swis soldiers.
In the middle of one of the dances
Swiss detectives entered the Casino
and arrested a young and beautiful
Spanish woman on a warrant charg
ing her with being a spy in the pay of
Germany. The incident created a
great sensation, as the prisoner has
been for some time a popular and
prominent figure in the best society in
Switzerland.
The second sensation occurred short
ly before midnight, when Herr
Schmidt, formerly Austrian Consul at
Lausanne, and a director of the Palace
Hotel, made insulting references to
thf Allies, and was promptly knocked
down by a well-known Swiss resident.
The manager o the Casino summoned
the gendarmes, and both Herr Schmidt
and his assailant were arrested.

on
River improvement work in the Mis
sissippi opposite the Cape which was
to have been started this 'week by the
Federal dredge and tow boats from
the government fleet lying off Gray's
Point, has been indefinitely delayed,
it became known yesterday, on account
of the rising stage of the water.
The river yesterday rose at the rate
of a tenth of a foot an hour and about
midnight the stage registered at If)
feet. It is necessary for the water
to be much lower than that in order
for the dredge and tow boats to oper
ate successfully.
Rivermen last night declared that
the river will reach a good stage be
fore a fall sets in.
The work that is to be done on the
Fast Side is in repairing what is
known as a fence. For repair work
and all kinds of river work in the St.
Louis district that segment of the
river between St. Louis and Memphis
Congress recently appropriated
$.150,000 which has become available
and the work will be started shortly.
The government fleet within the
last two days has been split into two
sections, one remaining fn this part of
the stream and the other going north
to Keokuk, la., where they wfll be
operated in making experiments with
all sorts of dredging machinery.
A special appropriation of $350,000
has been made by Congress to be de
voted exclusively to experimental work
with all river machinery in an effort
to learn what will be the most efficient
engines to use in river improvement
work. Captain Irvin, commander of
the fleet, now is at Keokuk in active
charge of the experimental work and
several of the tow and dredge ma
chines have been moved north.
Between 75 and 100 pieces still re
main stationed at Gray's Point, how
ever, to be used in doing the river im
provement work this season. These
pieces consist of dredge boats, tow
boats, tugs, barges and every other
kind of floating apparatus used in the
river work.
Capt. Brose Channois now is in com
mand of the fleet at Gray's Point, in
the absence of Captain Irvin.
DU PONT FAMILY IX
PRIMARY BATTLE-ROYAL
Wilmington, Del., Aug. 1. A pic
turesque light between rival factions
of the great Du Pont powder-making
family was staged today at the Re
publican state primaries to elect dele
gates to the state convention and nom
inate county and district candidates
for places to be filled at the November
election.
The two branches of the enormous
ly wealthy clan are headed by Alfred
I. Du Pont and T. Coleman Du Pont,
the latter being Delaware Member of
the Republican National Committee
and boomed for the Republican presi
dential nomination at Chicago recent
ly. It is believed Senator Henry Du
Pont is lined up with T. Coleman's
party.
In the courts and in politics the pow
erful family is now struggling, thus
carrying out the prophecy of an old
employe of the powder company made
nearly half a century ago:
"Mind what I say, my boy, this Du
Pont family, one of these days, will
be divided by the creek, and bitter will
be the fight."

TO ANTE-DATE FIRE
PREMIUM RATE CUT
15-Cent Reduction Will Begin
When Occupation Tax
Was Repealed.
A storm of protest that has been
brewing among business men of the
Cape who plan to pay their fire insur
ance premiums w ithin the next month,
was frustrated yesterday afternoon
when it became known that a l-Veent
reduction in the rate on commercial
risks will be made, dating from the
repeal of the city ordinance providing
a $23 a year occupation tax against
fire insurance companies.
La:-t spring when the Swat-the-Fire
campaign was carried on in the Cape,
promises were made by the insurance
rate men that the 15-cent reduction
would be made as soon as the city re
peal ?d the occupation tax against the
companies.
Thia was done by the council in June
and virtually at the same time a new J
license ordinance was passed impos
ing licenses on delivery wagons and
vehicles in ways that had not been
done theretofore.
Business men have paid their licens
es, and within the last few days they
believed they would be forced to pay
the additional 15 cents per $100 valua
tion on their insurance premiums also.
The rate was not amended by the Mis
souri Inspection Bureau.
Last week when E. W. Watson, rat
ing expert for the Missouri Insurance
Department, was in the Cape, he dis
cussed the insurance situation with A.
C. Vasterling, when he told him that
the new rate will be dated from the
time of the passage of the repeal or
dinance. Mr. Vasterling yesterday afternoon
when he made public this phase of the
situation, said that he had sent the
Missouri Inspection Bureau a copy of
the repeal ordinance, and yesterday
afternoon City Counselor O. A. Kne
hans requested City Clerk R. W. Fris
sell to furnish the inspection bureau
at St. Louis with a certified copy of
the ordinance.
Insurance men also lookTorward to
an additional decrease in the fire in
surance rates in the Cape when the
fire department is installed in the
Cape.

London, Aug. 16. A new blow for J
which the Franco-British artillery has
been preparing for several days, wa-
struck this afternoon against the Ger- f
mans on both the Xorth and South side i
of Somme. The Teuton trenches were
carried on a front of two miles, on
both sides of the Village Maurepas, to
a depth of from .".00 to 600 yards deep.
South of the river the German line
for three quarters of a mile was cap

strategy," said a German officer, "be
cause the faster they advance with
their left wing in tho Southeast, the
more they weaken the position of theis
right wing along the Stochod."
It is admitted here that th,.- Rus

The Russian tactics kept the Austrians
guessing for several weeks, but now
the whole Austro-German front is re
organized and the earlier Russian ad
vantages are being overcome.
The fall of Stanislau and Goritz was
admittedly unpleasant, but viewed
strategically have a different meaning,
according to German military men.
These reverses are completely out
weighed by the Russian failure to
reach Kovcl and Lemberg. The Ger
mans marvel that they didn't succeed,
in view of the gigantic English and
French blows, but at the critical mo
ment German troops arrived and stiff
ened the lines east of Kovel.

RAILROAD WORKERS
REACH THE CAPITAL
President Says He Will Confer
With Road Heads, If
Plan Fails.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Washington, Aug. If,. Six hundred
chairmen of the railway employes'
union, representing to the full limit
the authority of the railroad workers
of the United States, arrived in Wash
ington on a special train at 5:41) and
6:25 tonight to participate in a meet
ing with President Wilson at the
White House, at :i o'clock tomorrow
afternoon.
The President will lay before there
his p!an of settling their difference.?.
Upon their acceptance or declination
rests peace or a strike. It is under
stood tonight that the employes will
be asked to abandon their stand
I against arbitration in the matter of
time and a half for overtime.
The railroad managers have agreed
the principal of the 8-hour day, but
thev refuse to nrant timo :iml li.ilf fnr
all overtime. The program which the
unions must either accept or reject, is
this: That they continue to work on
an eight hour day basis; agree to Fed
eral investigation of hours and the
pay. If time and half for overtime is
found to be just by the investigator,
the agreement will be restorative and
all members of the union will lie paid
time and half for all overtime from
the !;.te of the :grcenicnt. Ur.t if the
time and half pay is found to be not
prarticable, the men must agree to
arbitrate the matter of a new overtime
wage scale.
This program was mapped out by
President Wilson today, and it is said
it has the sanction of some of the
representatives of the union. Presi
dent Wilson at first asked for a con
ference with the union men at 10
o'clock in the morning, but he later
changed the hour to M in the after
noon. President Wilson let it be known to
day that he would summon the presi
dents of many railroads to Washington
for a conference if the meetings to
morrow do not result in u settlement.
As he has taken a stand in favor of
the men, he is not expected to experi
ence any difficulty in inducing them to
postpone a break until he has exhaust
ed every effort for peace. He hdd a
long conference with Sa luiel Gomp
ers tonight, but neither discussed the
topic discussed.
The union men received a long mes
sage from William J. Bryan tor.giht,
giving his views on the strike situa
tion. The contents of the message
were not divulged.
BRIDAL PAIR WEATHER STORM
Elbert Vogelsanger Was 18 Hours on
Way to Cape from Bucodav
After driving over road:; heavy with
either mud or sand almost continuous
ly for 18 hours. Elbert Vogelsanger
yesterday morning arrived in the Cape
with his bride, who, before their mar
riage, was Miss Opal O'Brien.
They were accompanied on the trip
by Mrs. J. F. Vogelsanger and Miss
Hortense Hancock, an intimate friend
of the bride's with whom she visited
for several days in the Cape this sum
mer. The party started from Bucoda, the
home of the bride's parents, at 4
o'clock Tuesday afternoon and after a
continuous drive, they pulled into the
Cape at 10 o'clock yesterday morning.
On the first few miles of the journey
no rain was encountered, but the deep
sand made driving slow.
As the party approached Dexter, the
rainfa'l set in and they traveled
through the storm. Three times the
machine had to be pulled out of the
mire.
Mr. and Mrs. Vogelsanger now are
making their home at the Sander place
on Themis street.
