MINXKOLA SPRING!.
WhHt the nnd Indian Did Boy
Hcoula Teach the Doing of Ctood
loedN A ViHlt nt the Spring.
(By L. Roy Ferris.)
Did you ever go to the circus to
see the painted Indians dance their
1 war dance and hear them sing their
war song, which sounds like a little
bny crying because he can't gototown
with Uncle John, only It sounds a
great deal louder? And watch them
shake their awful looking war hatch
ets. I tell you It makes a fellow feel
creepy up and down his back, and
he Is glad he has hold of dad's finger,
for dad Is a big man and can do any
thing, and you are going to be Jusl
like your dad when you grow up.
Well, one time In the year of 1813,
about 35 miles from Mexico, lived a
man, his wife and little boy about 12
years old. One day when little Tom
went, down in the pasture after old
Bossy, the cow, down where the vi
olets and columbines grow, old Bos
sy was not there, for she had taken
a notlon.to go viBltlng up at the won
derful Salt Gum Springs, which is
now called Mlnneola. You see the
water was a salty taste and the ani
mals liked it. But someone had
sawed down old Brother Bear's
home (the hollow sycamore tree),
and cut off a length, like you do when
you make a whistle out of elder, and
had put it down in the spring to keep
the mud from filling the spring. Old
Bossy, the cow, had caused the little
boy's father so many trips to the
spring to bring her home that the
boy's father decided to move close to
the spring, so old Bossy could drink
alt the salt water she wanted.
So he built a log house, which
still stands, and cut down some tim
ber and planted i field of corn.
One day when the boy and his fa
ther were plowing they thought they
heard old Mr. Owl catl across the
creek, and in a minute another owl
answered and the boy's father told
him to continue plowing while he
went to investigate but to be sure
and carry his gun on the plow for it
is something unusual for Dr. Owl to
call In the morniug when every res
pectable owl is supposed Ao be at
home In bed.
Now here is the sad part of the
story. You see the Indians imitate
the different animalH in their calls
and Boon two painted Indians had
swam the creek and bad found the
gun the boy had put aguinst the tree
Instead of carrying It with him as
IiIh rattier told him to, and now 1 re
gret to tell you the rest, but the In
dians killed the little boy and sj
most killer his father, so you see it
always pays to mind father, for the
Indians only had their bows and ar
rows, and the boy was a good shot.
I don't know what would have
Anally happened if a man, dear to ev
every boy's heart, Daniel Boone, Lad
not come to that part of the-couutry
to visit his uncle, and succeeded in
driving the Indians away.
Daniel Boone built a platform iu a
great tree close to the spring from
which be shot deer when they came to
lick the- salti and it is only of late
that the tree has blown
down. A
band of good women have placed sev
eral granite shafts, one of them
right near the spring, to mark the
path Daniel trod.
Now, the other day, a bunch of
Boy Scouts visited this very spot,
but they were not the kind that love
war. What they love la to do a good
deed every dav, and the corners of
their mouths turn up Instead of
dowu, which means they love to be
pleasant.
You could look In every knapsack
thru every pocket and In every hoi'
low log near the camp and you would
uot find a cigarette, for they want to
be strong, healthy men when they
grow up. .
The patrol leader Is a red beaded
boy named Archie, for you know It
takes a red headed boy to do things.
If you will bave your dad hitch up
the automobile before they leave and
vltilt the camp, which u located on
Mr. E. B. Scauland'a farm, near
Mlnneola Springs, they will show you
the wonderful secret of what it
means to think about other people's
pleasure as well as your own
