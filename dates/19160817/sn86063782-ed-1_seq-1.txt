State and carpetbagging days in South
Carolina formed the i? pic of a rare
Interview with Greeen Coleman of
Charlotte yesterday, When the aged
negro, once a State Senator, wearing
a high beaver hat and Prince Albert
coat was in the seventh zenith of
negro heaven in the halls of the old
South Carolina Statehouse at Columbia.
"Them was days when de nigger
was in his g]ory fo shure," remarked
Coleman, as he related with a relish,
recollections of 1875 and *76 when the
carpetbaggers and the niggers held
the State of South Carolina at th;ir
mercy; when the corridors of the State
House at Columbia reeked with drunken
statesmen, when thousands of dollars
worth of liquors and cordials and
choioe cigars were kept constantly on
tap at the Statehouse for the hundred
or more nigger Senators and
"statesmen'' ana tneir carpeiuaggmg
friends, who conducted a reign of terror
.second only to the days of the
Roman upheaval.
The skies were overcast with dark
pminous clouds of socia] and political
unrest back &ere in '75 and '76 when
Wade Hampton stepped in and redeemed
the fair name of the Palmdtto
State, with the co-operation of native^hiteg
and the ^slnce-fa^ha
shirts turned out <Tvery"negro^^B
a statesman's berth, stopped the lo<^
ing of the State Treasury, bridled
graft and bribes and again made Sou.j^
Carolina righteous and unashamed. And
Green Coleman, then a resident
of Chester, S. C., and a typical
negro of his day and time in intelligence
and moraj^?uina, was elected
to office by his uenchmen and nigger
votes to represent Chester in the State
Legislature. The o]d negro tells about
it with rare frankness.
He described in his own inimitable
way how the niggers and carpetbaggers
ran rampant with the people's
money and with their voting power,
appropriations for anything under the
sun being as readily obtained as a
match with which to light a twentycent
cigar purchased at the expense ot'
the Commonwealth. There were maybe,
he says, 150 niggers in the halls
of the State Legislature back there in
'75 and '76, and every one of them
felt that It wa6 a wonderful time for
the black race. And they made every
minute of it count because deep
in their hearts they knew a day of
reckoning would come, and when it
did?they realized the negro would
be no more in the exalted places so
rudely usurped by the power of men J
who stripped the Sta'e of all it held
dear and sold themselves to the highest
bidders.
Votes were sold openly and without
shame ten twent, thirty at a time,
some for as high as a hundred dollars
and others as low as five and ten dollars.
according to the amount of graft
the niggers had been told were available.
Green Coleman admitted without
a touch of shame or remorse, that
the highest price he ever obtained for
his vote in the South Carolina State
House was $100 in United States currency,
and it was a '"heap sight of
money" to a nigger brought up on a
plantation in those days.
Then the former Chester negro
told of the silent, mysterious, awe-incnirtncr
notivitips of the Klu KlllX Clan
"K" **?
and the terrible way in which one alter
another negro Senators and lawmakers
of the day before disappeared
as if the earth had opened and swallowed
them, until the fear of the
wrath of God or some unseen, unknown
force turned craven tlie nigger
heart and his little stock of courage
oozed through his skin until it
left him weak, hollow eyed and shivering
on the threshold of frantic despair.
x "We took our meals with the white
carpetbaggers at the hotel near the
Statehouse in Columbia and slept
there, too, when we got any sleep,
because there was gambling goiug on
all night and games of chance for
money and such things, but we mixed
with the white folks all the tiiue and
at night we had carriages and spans
of horses to draw us about town or
Senator
tirring Days of '76
wherever we wanted to go with our
) beaver hats and our good clothes. 01:,
B boss, things come easy in those
^ days.
"Yas, sir, boss, I done sold my votes
many en many a time fer most cash
in sight, but de highest bid ever I
got was $100, en I tucks it in my
1 jeans like al] de rest. I didn't caro
no moah fo South Carolina den what
I could git outen it, jes like all of de
: white folks en niggers in power dem
days. We bad good liquor too in our
1 desks and out in de halls where we
could ask folks to take some with
us, en we had paiges fer to wait on
us like we all was lords of the land."
Coleman described in negro vernacular
of the appearance on the political
horizon of Gen. Wade Hampton,
twice Governor of South Carolina,
and how Hampton's mighty
power and stalwart personality cleared
the atmosphere within a few
months, drove the carpetbaggers to
cover, and the niggers to the swamps
for the safety of their own worthless
lives.
Day after day the "red shirts" and
the Klu Klux clan made inroads into
the ranks of the pilferers of statehood
and one by one the dark Senators
and lawmakers disappeared as
if by magic, leaving no word, writing
no regrets, telling no tales, but always
that mysterious, inexplicable
silence, after the warning, and some
never even told their associates of
those grewsom? warnings of the fate
that lay fefore them.
"I done got scared unto death,"
said Green, in relating his own experiences.
"I done see dem disappear
like dey go up in smoke, one by
one, 'til they begin whispering 'bout
de Klu Klux gitting die one en dat.
Den one day I-goes to mah room in
de hotel whare we all stay and dare
I finds a note to^ a lin' ^
'spects ef I dope stpld dereC anodder
^ight dem red shirte or dem Klu Klux*
done kotch me to shure."
Within a few days later every one
of the nigger long-coats and beaver
hats had disappeared forever from
(the historic halls of the old State
House and the hotel nearby was
almost deserted even the few carpetbaggers
remaining in seclusion
with their doors securely locked and
chained and their sleep distur ?> 1 by
fitful dreams and sounds of shots.
The notes written by unknown hands
continued with alarming frequency
and the red shirted patriots of a new
freedom and a newer Statehood,
were visible day and night at every
corner and on every hand, until
name and fame and power of Wade
Hampton became a byword on e\estreet,
in every house and at all
times, on every lip it foretold the beginning
of the end of misrule, negro
power and carpetbagging throughout
the length and breadth of the Palmetto
State, even then milked dry of all
its richness save the heritage o' un
sullied manhood and the flower of its
womanhood, many of whom had been
openly insulted, jostled on the streets
and degraded to the depths of despair
by the growing boldness ot the
niggers and their vain, pompous airs
of superiority assumed.
N<? one knows or ever will know
how the Klu Klux disposed of scores
of negro bodies that paid the penaltj
for the vain exaltation, but one b>
one they disappeared, sometimes with
mysterious assistance, and at other
times l?\ fright by freight. Oft*
times a rough wooden casket was laid
at their door in the night. Again a
brief note pinned to the door told
them in terse language what to expect.
Those who defied the Klu Klux
almost without exception slept in unmarked
graves within a few short
days.

New Revolution Possible. I
Reports to the state department* (
however, show that the border states v
: of Mexico are in a pltifl economic
condition and that the situation for ?
that reason, ifnd because of the in- <j
creased numbers of lawless bands operating,
threatens to result in a new j

any hitch in the negotiations between 1
the two governments.
