CLUE TO
AUTO THIEVES
Station Bandit and Auto Thief
Believed to Be Working
Together.
Marshlll Hortoa and tbr
officers of the A. H. T. A. havf
established, they believe, th
identity of the thief or thieve
who stole Geo. W. Sikes' Foru
last Wednesday night from bis
garage.
They have also connected the
same men with the hold up oi
Nieht Agent Collins and two
other men at the Frisco depot the
night before.
The man who took the car is
believed to be one J. 0. White
side, a man about 22 years old,
whose home is at Miami. He
has been around this city all
summer and is a ball player, de
scribed at a slender six footer,
with auburn hair faded out
around the edges to a light
yellow.
On the night of the thefts
a man stopped at Chetopa and
got gosoline from a garage. He
is described as a man about 30,
dark complected, smooth shaven,
about 5 feet 9 inches tall. This
man answers the description of
the man who robbed the depot
the night previous.
This circumstance indicates
that the two men are working
together.
Shortly before his disappear
ance Whiteside cashed two or
three checks at Baxter stores.
These checks were returned
marked "no funds."
Police officers all over the
country have been given a de
scription of the men and the cat
and a reward of $50 00 has been
offered for their capture and tbr
recovery of the car.
The officers think that they
went into Oklahoma and are very
likely making their way t
Dallas or some other large city
where they expect to dispose ol
the stolen car.
