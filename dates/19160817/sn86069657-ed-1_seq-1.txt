to him from his great great grand
daddy Niblack a" bcund volume of
the Methodist Magazine published
in 1825. Written in the back of
"this book we find this inscription,
legibly penned, in ink:
"May the 9th, 1835": In the year of

cun the improvement oi uiat
stretch of rough road along his
farm. He is nutting down bed
rock and grading up the road, and
graveling it, making a first-class
road of its kind.
Elder Mcintosh so improved a
' portion of this road two years ago
on his own responsibility, and
' therefor received the thanks of hun
dreds of travelers. This will be on
the route of the Stanton-Irvine in
tercounty scat road. It thus seems
that Estill without bonds will beat
us. There aro other enterprising
citizens in tho neighborhood who
will join in where Elder Mcintosh
, leaves off. It is also a cinch that he
knows how to build a road, and has
dona as much work on tho roads.

Man Escapes Horse Drowns.
After the heavy nun Tuesday
,aferiloon, a traveling optician,
whose flame we could not, learn,
but-is some foreigner, drove into
a -creek crossing on the Hard
wick's creek ro.'d. The water
was very swift and washed the
buggy and horse down stream.
The man made his escape by some
one coming along and rendering
aid. The buggy was found some
distance down the creek next
day, completely demolished; the
horse was found still further
down the creek.
Ihe horse nnd buggy were the
property of a Richmond livery.
Persons who saw the horse before
drowning say he was well worth
S200.00.
And still some people think it
is right to tax the peoplo living
along rue Uardwick's Lreek road
and all other roads in the county
for 20 years to build one and a
half roads in the county and at
tho same time let these peonle
swim the creeks nnd plunge the
mud. Tho vyriter is one that
does npt believe this is righUand
shall fifjlir such an unfair Dron-
ositiou.

weeks ago in a very serious con
dition, and who so remained for
some time, is uow improving

awaiting a turn for the better.
Dynamiting Fish.
Two distinct explosions of dy.

trify. The people of Winches
ter and Clark .county aro work

The Times. He enlisted in the
service of UncleSam about twelve
months ago. but could not at this
time pass the examination on ac
count of underweight and a crip
pled font which he cut a sliort
time after he enlisted.
Trustee Election Changes Time.
The election of trustees for the
common schools will not be held
this year in August as formerly,
but will be held the first Satur
day in October instead. The law
was so changed owing to the fact
that the primary and trustee
election coming on tho same day
in August always caused a slack
ened interest in the trustee elec
tion in favor of the often oxcita-
able primaries.
Returns from Hospital.
F. G. Coulee returned yestor.
day from Lexington where he
underwent a slight operation
ast week. Except from weak
ness and a slightly paled face,
Mr. Coulee looks but little worst

Tracy, of Dayton, is visiting his
cousins, Hoke and Frnnkliu
Smith.
The condition of Wm. Eaton.
Sr. has become juiore critical in
the past fow'day8.
Colored Folks Leaving
According to a well informed
local colored citizen, over 250 ne
groes hn,ve left Montgomery coun
ty in the past few months for
Northern cities, principally in
Ohio, where attractive wages are
ueing oitereu by big concerns
who have war munitions con
tracts. The vote in the two col
ored wards here in the recent
primary was less than half cast
last fall. Many vacant houses
are to be found throughout the
colored section. Local agents
for industrial insurance compan
ies who do a large business
among the colored folk place the
estimate of migrating negroes
much higher than above quoted.
Mt Sterling Gazette.
Increase in Population.
The preliminary report of Vi
tal Statistics show that there
were reported during the first six
months of 1910, 28.G06 births and
14,003 deaths, leaving a net gain
of 18,703 in population. Of the
deaths 2,070 were taken away by
tuberculosis; 1,078 by pneumo
nia, and one by small pox, the
most guarded against of all dis
eases; 070 met death by violence.
This vital statistics law is re
garded by many as a bother, but
it is good for us to know how fast
we are coming into the world,
and how rapidly we are depart
ingand from what causes.

Shoot Well rails.
The Virden well drilled in two
weeks ago was shot Monday with
nitroglycerine, but it did no
good. The oil in this section
is not producing the show we
have" all been fondly hoping for,
uuc uriuing is not all over, we
earn. Here is still hoping for
something better at the last hour
Oil is found in nearly every hole
put down, but the quantity is too
smau.
Kentucky's Share
Kentucky will get, this year,
$07,471, of the Government's
$5,000,000, appropriated to all
the States for the improvement
ot roads over which U. S. mail is
carried. The law provides that
the btato or county must put up
ike amount, this money can
only be spent in building roads,
which, when built, must bo kept
up by tho counties. The law
provides that all roads so im
proved must be substantial in
character.
