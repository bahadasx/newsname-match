PARTY OPENS
nous
Postmaster Joe Moseley Tells
Leaders of Situation in
Christian.
REGULAR LOVE FEAST
Vigorous Campaign to Be
Conducted; Victory
Predicted.
Postmaster Joe E. Moseley return
ed yesterday from Louisville, where
he attended the opening of the
Democratic Headquarters and dis
cussed the political situation in this
part of the State with the organiza-.
tion leaders. Mr. Moseley was well
satisfied with the way the Democratic
phieftains were entering into the bat
tle which is predicted to be one of the
lest of Tnsny years. The party
workers will begin immediately work
ing up their plans in Christian county.
OPENING WELL ATTENDED.
Headquarters were officially open
ed by State Campaign Chairman
Campbell Cantrill at Seelbach, Lou
isville, Monday morning. If any
doubts were entertained of the en
thusiasm of Kentucky Democrats for
Wilson and Marshall they were dis
pelled and a determination was evinc
ed to carry the state by such a major
ity as will settle its political status for
years to come.
The quarters embrace a number of
large rooms en the tenth floor of the
hotel. They were' crowded all day
with men from all sections of the
state to do honor to the occasion and
to register their hearty approval of
the selection of Chairman Cantrill for
the important and difficult position.
and it was the unanimous opinion
that he was the right man in the right
place and that his efforts to bring all
factions together would result in the
elimiuation of Kentucky from the so
called doubtful column, leaving no leg
for the boastful republicans to stand
upon in their claim for supremacy in
the state.
Reports from all the districts now
held by democrats were full of com
fort and joy and showed that the
party is fully alive to the importance
of re-electing Wilson and the nomi
nees for congress, -who are ably sup
porting him in his efforts to faithfully
erve a common country, and the in
dications are that the delegation will
remain as it is, if not indeed there is
one addition.

Russian Army of South Cap
tures Principal Pass of
Carpathians.
WARSHIPS LEAVE TRIESTE
Cadorna Reported Within 13
Miles of Prize Long
South by Italy.
London, Aug. 10. The Russians
have captured Jablonitza, one 'of the
principal gateways from Galicia to the
Hungarian plains and Petrogrnd re
ports that their offensives in this di
rection are continuing. This is the
first news of an advance by the Rus
sian southern army since the conquest
of the Austrian crownland of Buko
wina was completed. A Router dis
patch says the Russians 'have rcoccu
pied Vormkhta and Ardjeliet on the
river Pruth, south of Jablonitza. The
Russians captured 1,038 prisoners.
Further to the north the Russians
are continuing their driving opera
tions against the Austrians with ap
parently uninterrupted success. Their
troops are pouring across the Zlota
Lipa at several points in spite of 'des
perate resistance on the part of the
Teutonic forces. Fierce fighting is
being waged along the entire line
south of Brody and Gen Brussiloff
apparently is making a supreme ef
fort to cut off the army ot uen. von
Bothmer and force its surrender.
As far as the other theatres of war
are concerned, main interest centers
in the Italian operations, no impor
tant action being reported on either
(he British or French fronts.
The Italians are vigorously press
ing theiradvance on the Carso pla
teau and Rome reports the capture of
several sections of the Austrian
trenches and the taking of more than
1,600 prisoners. Unofficial dispatches
from Italian sources claim Gen. Cad
orna now is within thirteen miles of
Trieste and that the Austrian fleet has
left the harbor.
