CHAUTAUQUA
STARTS FRIDAY
Secure Season Tickets Before the
Opening Entertainment.
Many people when approached to
buy Chautauqua tickets reply with the
statement that they are going to buy
single admission tickets, and do not
realize that if they do and attend an
average number or these entertain
nients it will cost them more than sea
son tickets would if purchased in ad
vauce and the money has all gone to
the company and the local guarantors
have received no credit for the money
sient.
lluy a season ticket and it is good
for all the members of your family,
and the credit for the sale goes to help
make up the amount guaranteed by the
local people who stand behind the er
fort to get a good entertainment in
Vale and who stand to lose if 4(N
tickets are not sold before the opening
of the llrst entertainment tomorrow.
There is no money to be made by the
guarantors, but if the people do not
come up and purchase the tickets they
stand to lose a pro rata share of the
delicit.
The Uedpath Chautauqua last sea
son was above expectations and we
have the assurance of the company
that the one this year is fully as good
if not better than the one last year.
Last year there was a small deficit
but the guarantors cheerfully put their
names to another guarantee trusting
that the people appreciated it enough
so that they would support another.
Should there be more than the 400
tickets sold the money left after the
expenses are paid will be held as a fund
to help llnance another Chautauqua.
If we are to have a success this year
and another next year it is up to all to
buy Beason tickets.
Announcement has just been made
by the management of the Uedpath
Chautauquaa of the mang good things
in store on the forthcoming season's
program in this community. This pro
gram covers a period of live days, af
ternoons and evenings, in addition to
the work of the story hour lady or
playground worker.
Friday afternoon at three o'clock
there will be a grand concert given by
the Smith-Spring-Ilolmea Company
with trombones, cornet, violin and
piano, llute and 'cello. Mr. Smith and
Mr. Holmes of thiB company are well
known composers of music and their
selections for band instruments are
played by bands everywhere.
On Friday night at eight o'clock a
half hour concert will be giyen by the
Smith-Spring-liolmea Quintette pre
eluding the splendid lecture on "Amer
ica's Destluy" delivered by Dr. George
il. Bradford, who looks so much like
William Jennings Uryan that he is of
ten mistaken for him. Dr. Bradford
has long been known, not only as a
lecturer but as chancellor of the Uni
versity of Oklahoma.
We are pleased to announce a much
stronger program for Saturday niter
noon, as the Kuauiau Count's talk has
been discontinued and in his place was
secured the well known Clarence Locke
Miller, who will give his lamous and
masterful lecture on the "Democracy
of Achievement." A deep subject
forcefully handled.
A very entertaining half-hour pre
lude will be given to the above men
tioned lecture by Hobert il. Manlove,
an impersonator and humorist. Mr.
Manlove's time on the platform will
pass all too quickly for the audience,
but everyone may have an opportunity
of seeing him again Saturday night,
at which time he gives another half
hour prelude to the unique and beauti
ful entertainment given by Mr. and
Mrs. Francis Itawei and daughter,
highly educated New Zealanders in a
presentation of the scenes, music and
customs of the South Sea Islands. At
tired in native costumes they stand
amid the scenes of their country which
are thrown by means of a powerful
stereoptican on the background of the
stage, while Mr. Itawei describes the
Mew Zealand of sixty years ago and
Mrs. Itawei the Mew Zealand of today.
Grouped about the platform In front
of them is the basketry and samples of
Polynesian weaving which may be Been
more closely by the audience at the
close of the evening.
There will be no program on Sunday
this year.
The regular program will be returned
on Monday afternoon wheu the Ueulah
Buck Concert Company give a half
hour prelude to Frederick E. Hopkins
in his lecture specializing on communi
ty building, h or many years Mr. Hop
kins haB been a favorite orator upon
the Lyceum and Chautauqua platform.
On Monday night the entire evening
will be given over to a grand concert
by the Jieulah Jluck Ladies' Quartet
which has been upon the Lyceum and
Chautauqua platform for seven years
with great success. This is one of the
best known ladies' quartets in America
today.
Tuesday will be another big event
of the week known as "Health Day"
when Dr. Charles K. Barker, who was
Pres. Taft's advisor during his admin
istration in Washington, will give two
addresses. One of these will be entitled
"Health and Happiness" and the other
"How to Live One Hundred Years"
Dr. Barker was one of the biggest at
tractions in 1915 on the big Uedpath
Seven-day Chautauquaa which opened
in Jacksonville, Fla., and closed in
Chicago. It was not unusual for 30U
people to be gathered about him at the
close of his lecture, asking questions.
And on Wednesday the last and big
gest day of all.
Frank Kryl and his band of nearly
twenty men will appear In two con
certs oa Band Day. Mr. Kryl, director
and soloist on the French horn, a broth
er of Bohumir Kryl, the coruetist and
band leader, was born and educated
abroad, but has been in this country
about twenty-live years. He played
during the World's Fair In Chicago
and at every big exposition since, in
cluding the recent 1'anaraa Exposition,
For years he has played with the Chi
cago Symphony Orchestra, of which
Frederick is In charge, also with Dr.
Kimwald of the Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra.
STORY HOUR FOR CHILDREN.
The Play ground Work and Story
Hour of this season's Chautauqua will
be held each morning, beginning with
Saturday morning from nine-thirty to
ten thirty at the Chautauqua tent with
Miss Uallie Collins in. charge. All
children are cordially welcome to at
tend the story hour free of charge.
However those parents who wish their
children to have advantage of the spec
ial training during the week to take
part in the Pageant given the last
night of the Chautauqua will buy a
child's season ticket.
A Popular Resort
"The weather has been so warm this
summer that people do not realiie that
the river and lake excursion season is
quickly drawing to a close," said O. S.
Dustin, general passenger agent of the
Ashley it Dustin line, whose steamers,
Put in-Bay and Frank K Kirby make
daily trips from Detroit to Put-In-Bay
and Sandusky.
"Less than a month remains for peo
ple to take the cruise from Detroit to
the Lake Erie resorts or from Sandusky
to Detroit. Many inquiries are being
made as to when the season closes, and
we have informed all that the Put-In-Bay
will make its final trip on Sunday,
September 9.
Mr. Dustin says that Cedar Point,
to which the steamer Put-In-Bay goes
on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, is more popular this year than
ever before. The number of people
who have taken the trip to Cedar Point
Is greatly in excess of that of a year
ago.
The wonderful bathing beach at
Cedar Point, which is called "The At
lantic City of the West," has drawn
thousands to the Lake Erie resort this
summer according to Mr. Dustin.
"Put-In-Bay remains as popular as
ever, and provision has been made to
entertain the excursionists in every
possible manner," said Mr. Dustin.
"Bathing, boating, and dancing are en
Joyed by thousands. Then, too, there
is always an opportunity to visit the
wonderful caves as well as go to the
top of the million dollar Perry monu
ment." Mr. Dustin says that the 1016 season,
up to the present time, has been one oi
the most successful in the history of the
Ashley & Dustin line. While the num
ber of passengers carried on holidays,
Saturdays and Sundays has been un
liuiillt larna thsra la I amm ..lontv nt
room on the Put InJiay the other days
of the week, accordiug to Mr. Dustin.

Friday and Saturday mornings, talks
on agricultural subjects were given at
the V. M. C. A. at Lakeport. The lirst
day soil principles and testing were
demonstrated. Simple experiments
were set up showing the rise of water
in the soil by capillarity and the eiiect
of tile draining. The testing of soil for
limo was also illustrated and explain
ed. On Saturday, the food require
meuts of our plants and animals were
discussed. It was shown tc the boys
by means of charts how the plants
take simple substances or elements
from the soil and build them up into
complex compounds suitable for per
sons or animals, and an effort was made
to make plain the great plan which
controls these processes. Mr. E. C.
Lindeman. State Leader in Boys and
Girls' Club work, was also secured to
assist with the program and was at the
camp from Saturday noon until Mon
day evening explaining vocational work
and nature study for young people our
ing morning lecture hours. Arrange

of some cow testing clubs with the boys
on the farms In different parts of the
county. This will be explained more
fully in a later report.
The Joint meeting and picnic held by
the Union and Burnsfde Farmers'
Clubs at Lake pleasant in Lapeer
county was attended on Thursday.
Various problems were discussed, but
special emphasis was Jaid on market

Sleeper For Governor And A "
United Republican Party In Mich.
According to reports received duriug
the past week from every section of the
state by Albert E. Sleeper of Bad Axe,
leading candidate for the Republican
nomination for governor, this slogan
has been adopted by the candidates for
county oflJce and the Republican work
era who are confident that Charles Ei
Hughes and Albert E. sleeper will head
a united party to a magnificent victory
at the November election.
Entrenched to some extent by feder
al patronage and state Jobs obtained
during the Wilson and Ferris adminis
trations, Democrats In some sections of
the Btate are planning desperate as
saults on the Republicans lines next
November.
In Charles E. Hughes the Republican
party has a candidate who will sweep
Michigan by a tremendous majority.
To successfully repulse the Democrats
all along the line it Is necessary that
the Republican candidate for governor
be a leader capable of welding all fac
tions together.
From all indications the county can
didatesthe boys in the trenchesfeel
that it is necessary to nominate a man
to head the state tl cleat who will make
their campaigns easier in the fall.
While many of the candidates for
county oflice have primary contests of
their own and are unable to participate
actively in the gubernatorial campaign,
many are quietly passing the word to
their friends that Sleeper's nomination
will cinch their election In November.
During the Republican Btate conven
tion last spring many leaders declared
that the sentiment among the dele
gates was practically unanimous for
Sleeper. "1 venture the prediction,"
declared a man who has watched con
ventions for many years, "that If a vote
could betaken in this convention today
eighty per cent or the delegates would
favor Sleeper."
Holmes For State Senator
Not a politician, not an orator, but
just a plain business man and employer
or labor.
If L. A. Holmes is chosen to repre
sent this senatorial district in the state
legislature he will serve the people well.
Mr. Holmes hails from Macomb
county. But he has factories In Port
Huron as well as in itomeo. lie is the
largest individual employer of labor In
the district.
Mr. Holmes seeks the nomination for
state senator on the republican ticket
at the primaries to be held August 2ft,
1918.
HE COULD HARDLY WALK
Deranged kidneys cause rheumatism,
aches, pains, soreness, stillness. Am
brose Gary, Sulphur, Okla., writes: "I
was bothered with kidney trouble 'ten
years and at times could hardly walk.
1 began taking Foley Kidney Pills. I
got relief from the first but continued
till 1 had taken three bottles. I feel
like a new man." Herb T. Hennessy,
Expositor liners pay, try on.

MORE MEN THAN WOMEN
HAVE APPENDICITIS
Surgeons state men are slightly more
subject to appendicitis than women.
Yale people should know that a few
doses of simple buckthorn bark, ply
cerine, as mixed in Adler-i ka, often
relieve or prevent appendicitis. Thia
mixture removes such surprising foul
matter that ONE SPOONFUL relieves
almost ANY CASK constipation, sour
stomach or gas. The IN STAN 1, easy
action of Adler-1-ka Is surprising.
