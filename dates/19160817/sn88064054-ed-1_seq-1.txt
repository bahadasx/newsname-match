IEANS ASK FOR REYENGE AND 1ET A BEATING
WHICH WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST GAME
The game of baseball between the
Fats and Leans last Saturday de
monstrated again that the Fats are 1
best ball players and hereafter the I
Leans must hold their peace despite
the fact that Sunday morning they i
tlimed that the New York Amer
icons could not defeat the Fats with ,
Mayor Sullivan umpiring.
W. P. Haley, a pitcher, was taken 1
out of the box because he tried to i
injure several of the Leans for per- .
sonal reasons. He hit Andy Dobbs
between the home plate and the
grandstand but Dr. Slaughter has
not been able to locate the exact
spot. He tried to brain his boss but
J. B. Lindsley knew what he was up
toand ducked just in time. Then
Dave Leer stepped up to the bat
and "Red" tried to fix Dave so that
he could not attend to business for
a month and the manager of
the Fats decided that it was not a
case of personal revenge so he re
moved Haley from the box. Major
Wood was then placed on the
mound and he held the Leans at
his mercy, only permitting them to
hit as he desired. S. Moore proved
a star behind the bat. J. Vol. Brock
played first with the same success
she convicts the criminals. H. J.
Cowgill proved to be the best all
round player, hitting, running and
fbiing like he did 20 years ago, but
SunWay morning he presented a pit
hal condition but was able to hob
ble around. Leopold Saux., who runs

the cost of the schools which will

the Pine Tree Inn as a side line and
plays baseball for a living, gave a
few exhibitions of what a regular
player can do. He is credited with
saving the game at four different
times. H. L. Porter proved to know
more about playing baseball than
managing a team and his stick
work was the talk of the day (for
'his batting average ask him, we
have not the heart to make it pub
lic.) The only trouble about Chas,
Flournoy in the game was that he
treated the ball as he does violaters
of the law-did not want to get his
hands off it until it was before the
judge. And Jake Purvis, his play
ing was worth the price of admis
sion, and he claims to have made
11 of the 13 runs made by the Fats.
Lamkin made known all about the
express rates. Jesse Johnson is cred
ited with knowing Blackstone, Lind
sley on running a bank, Copeland
on writing insurance. C. L. Johnson
on making a pay roll. Dobbs, "why
it is cheaper to own your own home
than to pay rent," Dave Lear may
know how to make pills and OBrien
how to conduct a hotel, but when it
comes to playing ball they know
nothing, so says the Fats, because
Letten and Morris, of the Leans are
said to have been responsible for
the 9 runs the Leans secured.
The proceeds of the game has
been given to the Patriotic Fund
and.it is said that a nice little sum
was realized.
MAIlX STARTS SHINGLE MILL
WHICH Will EMPLOY TEN
Another little industry which will
give work to not less than ten men
and at the same time open up a
market for the cypress timber will
be started this week when the mill
of M. Marx will open. Cypress
shingles will keep the force working
six days a week and aside from
cutting special orders of oak for
contractors no other sawing will be
d(one. The mill is located just out
I side the city limits and Mr. Marx
expects to keep it busy the year
round.
" Will Do Treach Work
I The many friends of Rev. Ed
I mund LaVergue. formerly pastor of
I the First Presbyterian Church of
I Bogalusa, but now of Victoria,
Virginia will be interested to learn
that a recent letter to Mr. and Mrs.
SLaBesseconveyed the news that
SRev. LaVergue will sail for France
in a few weeks, where he will work
among the soldiers as a Y. M. C. A.
-Secretary. Rev. LaVergue will be

mother.

ready Busy Serving
Last Notices
If your front or back vard is in
r bad condition you had better get it
in the proper shape at once and if 1
t you have a hog pen in the city
,f limits that causes offensive odors
r you had better get busy on it to- 1
l1 night and if their is any drainage
a from your place into the public
Y streets or gutters that your neigbors
d might complain of you can save a
h few dollars and the embarresment
of being brought before Judge Ott
and ask to pay a fine, a few dollars
r costs and then having the work
e done at your expense. Dr. Slaugh
ter made a detailed report of every
section of the city which showed
that some mighty bad conditions
existed, from a standpoint. There
were not so many, but enough
to raise the ire of the Com
mission Council and the entire
police department is going to co
d operate with the Board of Health
a in placing the city in a perfect
ir sanitary condition and property
h owners will be given five days to
it show cause why their premises
W have not been placed in perfect
n sanitary conditions.
In Richardsontown the hog pens
'r came in for censure, Columbia street
section got it from the back alleys
and the South Side from bad alleys
s' and weeds. North Bogalusa came
ie forward with complaints that the
negroes servant houses were not
connected with the sanitary sewer
system and Northwest Bogalusa
brought complaints about open
se sewers and bad alleys while Pleas
ant Hill was revorted the same.
e The negroes quarters, near the mill.
were reported in good condition.
The question of the city putting
d on garbage wagons was discussed
but no action was taken. The
i police started serving notices Tues
day morning on bad cases and the
tennants and owners will be given
,n until Saturday to have them in first
it class condition. Then the places
will be reinspected. If they are not
to the liking of the officials you are
re going to be served with a warrent
asking you to come before Judge
Ott and give your excuse for vio

SIANDERS WILL CRRY 10 OF THE
12 PARISHES OF THIS DISTRICT
Will Spend Several Days In Washington Parish As
Campaign Draws To Close--Just Question
Of Majority
Governor J. Y. Sanders spent
Sunday with home folks and while
here was given a warm welcome
and assurances that Washington
Parish will give him the largest
majority in the district at the pri
mary next September. The election
of Sanders is as certain as election
day comes and it is just a question
of his majority. The wise politicians
who have studied the situation say
that Governor Sanders will be elect
ed by no less than 3500 majority
while the average voter can see
nothing less than 5000. More inter
est is now being centered in which
parish will give him the largest
majority. East Baton Rouge Parish
claims that they will give the Gov
ernor at least 1000 majority, and
St. Tammany say they will give
him not less than 600. Washington
Parish, with even a smaller vote,
should give their home candidate
the largest majority in the entire
district and it is safe to predict now
that he will get a larger majority
in Washington than in St. Tamany.
PREVENTION OF CRUELTIY
TO CHILDREN ORGANIED
'Will Be A Parish Organi
zation Instead Of
Local Affair.
Every citizen of Washington Par
t ish will be invited to become mem
f bers of the Washington Parish So- r
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty I
to Children and vice-presidents will k
be appointed in each town and a
vicinity of the Parish who will co
operate with the president, E. L, s
SMiddleton and the officers and di- s
i rectors. The necessity of extending r
t 'the good work so as to include the v
t entire parish. instead of the city of r
s Bogalusa, was an idea which met
c with unanimous approval. The re
cent work of the Mothers Honor
Commission and the Juvenile Court
demonstrated that the officials have
more work outside of Bogalusa than
I in the city proper. The dues of the
- Society will be $3 per annum for
men, $1 for ladies and 25 cents for
children, and it is expected that the
membership will reach several <
thousand within the next few
p months. Committees will be formed 1
s to solicit members in each section I
t of Bogalusa. A meeting of the
board of directors will be held in 1
the next few days to decide upon i
definite committee appointments,
s The officers of the Society are E. 1
s L. Middleton, president: Mrs. N. S. 1
e Young. vice-president: C. J. Wade,
e secretary, and Mrs. C. L. Johnson,
,t treasurer. The Board of Directors
elected are as follows: Mesdames.
N. S Young. J. E. LaBesse, H. W.
Wolfe, W. C. Flanders, C. L. John
son, J. N. Ball, H. L. Porter. Messrs.
E. L. Middleton, H. H, Wilcox, C.

Engagement Announced
s Rev. and Mrs. T.J. Warlick an
t nounce the engagement and ap
e proachming marriage of their daughter
t Miss Frances Williams Warlick to
e Dr. James Hinton of Macon Ga.
SThe wedding will be celebrated in
September.
Governor Sanders stated while here
that he would carry ten of the
twelve parishes and would be no
I surprise if he carried the eleventh.
In Tangipahoa Parish and Amite,
the home of Mr. Sanders' opponent,
it is conceded will be the closest
parish in the district with both sides
claiming a majority of about 100.
The campaign which Governor San
ders is making is one of themost
interesting in the history of Louisi
ana politics and more interest is
attached to the race here, on ac
count of its onesidedness, than in
any other congressional race in the
State. Wherever Governor Sanders
is billed to speak he is greeted by
I large and enthusiastic audiences.
He is holding up well under his
heavy work and on Monday opened
his campaign in St. Tammany Par
ish: Governor Sanders stated be
fore leaving on the St. Tammany
i trip that he would speak in Boga
lusa and other towns in the parish
near the end of the campaign.
