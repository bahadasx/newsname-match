Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hospital
Prospectively the Henry W. Put
nam memorial hospital came into
existence on the afternoon of Octo
ber 15. 1912. when the trustees of the
village were requested to meet at the
office of the Mennington Water com
pany and were there informed that Mr.
Putnam had decided to give the water
system to the community for the pur
pose of founding and endow ing a mem
orial hospital. The conditions of the
gift were that the then-existing water
rentals for household use should be
reduced one-half and that beginning
the following January the net income
from the system should semiannually
be turned over to the treasurer of the
Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hospital
association.
During the 1912 session of the leg
islature the hospital association was
incorporated and other necessary acts
to carry out the puropose of Mr. Put
nam were enacted. Soon after the In
corporators of the hospital association
had organized a building committee
consisting of A. W. Mralsted. L. S.
Norton and J. It. Wilbur was selected.

has systematically but rapidly car

were secured from the architect,
Harry l,eslle Walker of New York. At
one period it was proposed to build the
hospital through an issue of bonds
which should be guaranteed toy the
village. The plans were submitted to
contractors and bids were received,
but the bonding Idea did not meet the
views of the more conservative niem
tners of the association and was
abandoned.
That the construction of the hospi
tal could be begun so much earlier
than was expected is due to the gen
erosity of Henry W. Putnam. Jr.. of
New York who in April this year
notified the hospital association that
he proposed to provide the sum.
$90,000. which the contractors had es
timated would be required for the pur
pose. Ground for the excavation was
broken May 111. Mr. Putnam turning

Governor Gates Sets Meeting for
Thursday Hug. 24
TO PROVIDE FOR SOLDIERS
So Many Things To Be Done That
Governor Decides That the Legis
lature Should Act.
Montpelier, Aug. 16. Gov. Charles
W. Gates issued a proclamation today
calling a special session of the Legis
lature at 10 a. m . Thursday. August
24, for the purpose of making pro
vision to put the Vermont soldiers,
now serving in the United States
army on the Mexican liorder, on the
state payroll and to provide tunds for
relief work among the soldiers' depen
dents. On several occasions since the
Vermont troops left for Texas rumors
have been circulated to the effect that
Gov. Gates was to call a special ses
sion but on each occasion the rumor
was denied from the office of the exe
cutive. It is expected that the session will
occupy two days and that nothing out
side of the voting of funds lor the
soldiers and relief work will be
brought to the attention of the Legis
lature. The proclamation issued by
the governor at 3 o'clock this after
noon reads:
"Whereas, the Vermont troops
Are now serving in the United
States army to preserve and main
tain peace and protect our citi
zens on the Mexican border;
"Whereas, Such seivlce is be
ing willingly and patriotically per
to personal interest and duty to
formed by our men at a sacrifice
family and home;
"Whereas. It appears that the
compensation received by these
men is not sufficient to meet their
needs and the needs of their fam
ilies and that if provision is not
soon made for such purpose such
families must become subject to
charity;
"Therefore. I. Charles W. Gates
governor of the state of Vermont,
do herehy. by virtue of the consti
tution in this respect, summon the
members of the Senate and House
of Representatives to meet In
Montpelier in their respective
chambers in the state house, to
gether with the officers of the
two houses, on the 24th day of
August, A. D.. 1910. at 10 o'clock
in the forenoon, to provide for
such compensation to Vermont
troops, in addition to United
States pay. and for such relief to
their families and their depend
ents as may seem advisable.

great seal of Jho state, at Mont

of the maples in Hunt's upper grove.
There was no athletic program this
