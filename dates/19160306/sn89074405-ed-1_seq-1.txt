Second Phaae Different.
The situation as a result of this sec
ond phase of the German offensive is
regarded as altogether different from
that of the first days of the battle.
The only progress made by the Ger
mans was during the first two days of
the second attack. After the first 43
hours they have not advanced.
The comparison also is in favor of
the French by reason of the fact that
the Germans now have lost the ad
vantage of surprise, and also because
the ground has been torn up to such
an extent that it cannot be organized
properly.
Demoralizing to Germans.
This information from semi-official
sources points out that it must be de
moralizing to the Germans to see
some 40,000 to SO,000 corpses of their
comrades lying before the French'
lines.
Reinforcements brought up .by the
Germans since the inauguration of
the second phase of the battle on
Wednesday are estimated here at
250,000 men, raising the total forces

Demoralizing to Germans to See Over

Before French Lines—Many
Sanguinary Attacks
Paris, March 6.—Yesterday was a good day for the French at Ver
dun, according to information received here today, and public confi
dence is greatly strengthened by the news of continued repulses of the
German attacks. In military and political circles lively satisfaction is
expressed regarding the situation, and the opinion now begins to pre
vail that the great efforts of the Germans will be more easily disposed
Of than at first was expected. There was no infantry fighting north of
Verdun last night.
GERMAN'S CHANGE PLAITS.
Having failed to make any Impression on the Douaumont position
or on Vaux to Its right, the German general stall determined to
smash the French left on the Vacherauvllle and Wood-Cote-De Poivrc
position.
REPULSED WITH HEAVY IIOSS.
Without regard to cost, the best troops were hurled forward, but
with no more success than elsewhere. Pomeranians, and what were
left of the Brandenburgers dashed themselves vainly against, the French
who stood as Immovable as a rock wall. At Vaux, the Germans fell
back, leaving heaps of dead on the field. Tfae French infantry, support
ed by their formidable artillery, which will never henceforth lack am
munition, showed themselves able to resist every onslaught.
ARTILLERY IS ACTIVE.
On the left bank of the Meuse artillery on both sides thundered
all day long. French Infantry in that section had little to do, but It re
mains there, ready for any eventuality, although military experts be
lieve It is extremely doubtful that the Germans will attempt to storm
Mort-Homme, the key to the position, for to do so they must deploy
over the plain a mile wide, under cross fire from the heights around.
It Is chiefly the French artillery which to Involved In the Woevre
fighting. French hold outskirts of the village of Manheulles firmly,
and have stopped all attempts of Germans to debouch In that direction.
STUBBORN FIGHTING CONTINUES.

W6men Nearly Create Riot

Odessa, Russia, via Londan, March
6.—It is reported from Constantinople
-that Turkish women broke into rail
way yards whence troop trains were
about -to leave, shouting protests
against sending the men "to go to
their, death." They threw themselves
on the rails in front of the trains. The
authorities refrained from using force
to remove them, these advices say,
fearing a mutiny among the soldiers.
The men were taken from the cars
but later were sent off secretly by
night.
It also is reported that the Turkish
general staff declined to summon be
fore a court martial Kiamil Pasha,
commander of the Turkish army in
the Caucasus, on account of certain
disclosures which might be made.
Consequently, the commander will
receive an honorable discharge.
These reports say further that the
people of Constantinople were led to
believe that the German army had
achieved a much greater victory at
Verdun than was actually gained, and
that when the facts were ascertained,
rioting occurred. It is stated German
troops suppressed the rioting.
Forty persons are reported to have
been killed in the wreck, of a passe'n
gertrain on the Berlin-Constantinople
railway near Nish, Serbia. Investiga
tion showed that rails had been loos
ened, and many arrests have been
made.

is Confiscated.
New York, March 6.—A party of
thirty nuns, members of the Order of
Salesians, who said their, church and
convent property at Morelas, Mex.,
valued at $250,000, had been confis
cated by the Carranza government,
arrived here yesterday on the steam
ship Antonio Lopez from Mexican
ports.
The members of the party, in
charge of the mother superior, Fran
cesca Chaony Antequera, are on their
way to Spain. They said they had
reaching a been forbidden to work longer in Mex-
ico.
"Our convent, where for more than
12 years we had been educating chil
dren of the peons, was closed early
in December," one of the nuns said.
"We were accused of being in sym
pathy with General Carranaa's en
emies and we were evidently convict
ed. At any rate we were told to leave,
being allowed to take with us only
our personal property.
"FYiends of our order in Vera Cruz

not subjected to any indignities but it
is hard to leave our work and the
hundreds of children whom we have
learned to love. Friends in Spain

Madrid."
Reports of an epidemic of typhus
in Mexico were confirmed by mem
bers of the party and other passen

however, that a systematic cleaning
up of the towns and widespread sani
tation work, mainly under the direc

Boston Police Take Trio of Men Who
Are Armed With Enough Ex
plosives to Blow Up Church.
Boston. Maroh 6.—Three men.
armed with revolvers and carrying
dynamite, percussion oaps, fuses and
blasting powder, were arrested bv a
squad of police on a shed roof ad
joining St. Mary's Catholic church in
the north end district, after a sharp
struggle yesterday.
They refused to tell what their pur
pose was or why they were hiding
near the church.
After the police had questioned
them unsuccessfully, they were held in
J20.000 bail each on charges of break
ing and entering, having burglars'
tools in their possession and "assault
upon an officer."
Later they were identified through
records in the rogues' gallery as John
Costa of Cleveland. Ohio, and John
Denatli and Rosario Conti of Phil
adelphia.
Police inspectors were much inter
ested in the resemblance between
Costa and Jean Crones, who is wanted
in Chicago on a charge of putting
poison in food served to church men
and other guests at a banquet.
A comparison of records carried out
the resemblance in many wavg, with
the exception of a very slight differ
ence in the measurements of the jaw.
The police expressed the opinion
that the men intendd to rob the safe
in the basement of the church. They
carried enough explosives the officers
said, to blow up half the edifice.
