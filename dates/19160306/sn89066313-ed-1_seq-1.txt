adviser of women
"When I hear the graduates of other
colleges tell about the training their
schools give along these lines and see
its beneficial results, I feel that I
have been deprived of much by M. U.'s
failure to help its women along these
lines. It is as little as I can do now
to call the attention of the people who
are looking out for the development
of our girls to Missouri's deficiency in
this respect."

dilhcult composition mat taxed her
technical abilitj'. Her tone is lull and
