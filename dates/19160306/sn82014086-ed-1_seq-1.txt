VERMONT TO VOTE ON
PROHIBITION TUESDAY.
Also Referendum Vote on the Direct
Primaries Act.
Montpelier, Vt., March o. -The ques
tion whether Vermont, which for four
teen years has permitted the licensing
of liquor selling under a form of local
option, shall again adopt prohibition
will be decided on at a town meeting
day next - Tuesday. . There will be a
referendum vote also on the accept
ance of the direct primaries act.
A prohibitory amendment to the
state constitution was passed by the
last legislature and will come before
the people on a yes and no vote. A
majority of the ballots cast in the 246
cities and towns will be sufficient to
determine the issue.
The prohibitory law first appeared in
the Vermont statutes in 1852, the state
being one of the earliest in the coun
try to forbid the sale of intoxicating
liquors within its borders. A quarter
of a century ago agitation in favor of
a local option law was begun and,
gradually gaining strength, culminated
in a repeal of the prohibitory amend
ment at a special election in February,
1902. The vote in favor of local option
was Yes 29,711', No 28,892, a majority
of 729.
On the next town meeting day 92
out of 246 cities and towns voted in
favor of liquor selling. The following
year the number of license towns drop
ped to 40, and there has been an al
most yearly decrease ever since.
At the elections a year ago 20 places
favored liquor selling, including the
cities of Burlington, Rutland, St. Al
bans and Vergennes. In six of the 16
towns voting yes the authorities re
fused to issue any licenses, which left
Bennington, Bethel, Brighton, Canaan,
Colchester, Fairhaven, Pownal, Shel
burne, Shoreham and West Rutland
as the only towns in which liquor
could be obtained legally.
If the prohibitory amendment is
adopted it will go into effect May 1,
the day on which all licenses expire.
PLAN TO ORGANIZE
AMATEUR RADIO OPERATORS
Would Make a Valuable Asset of Na
tion, Says President Wilson.
New York, March 5. The plan to
organize amateur radio operators
throughout the country into signal
corps and give them military trainitQ
as outlined by the National Amateur
Wireless Association "undoubtedly
would be a valuable asset to the na
tion," in the opinion of President Wil
son, from whom a letter to J. Andrew
White, acting head of the association,
was made public here today.
President Wilson wrote that it is
only through the agency of such or
ganized bodies under the direction of
representative American civil, military
and naval officials, that maximum effi
ciency can be obtained.
"The value of such an organization,1
continued the president's letter. "In
co-ordinating the activities of a large
number of specially qualified young
men along carefully planned lines will
be of great benefit not only in an edu
cational way to the young men them
selves, but also to the country at
large when the necessity for their em
ployment, individually or as an or
ganization, may develop."

a Barricade.
Paris, March 5. An episode of he

man who has arrived here and who
was posted in a quarry at Louvemont

"The quarry ended at the rear in a
deep cafe running under the plateau of
which the Germans would have ad
vanced to the attack. A detachment
to which I belonged took refuge in the
cave, while the heavy bombardment
lasting 48 hours was going one and
alter which the attack was delivered.
Arriving at the top the of pleteau, the
Germans dug an opening into the
cave from above, but were prevented
from entering, as they saw us with a
machine gun ready to receive them.
"In the meantime they had got in
to the quarry, so that part of our de
tachment had to rush forward to de
fend the entrance to the cave. The
Germans had no machine gun, but
they used long jets of liquid fire of red
and green color and it was by the light
of this given that the struggle went on.
"For some minutes the Germans
held their ground by piling up their
dead so as to for ma barricade, but at
last our machine gun drove them
back and they were then attacked and
driven out by another of our de
tachments, which arrved in the nick of
time."

4,O00,C0O SHELLS USED
IN BATTLE AT VERDUN.
Nothing Like Such an Expenditure cf
Munitions Known Before.
Paris, March 5. rrench artillery of
ficers who took part in the battle of
Verdun estimated that during the first
four days of the struggle the Germans
discharged two million shells, most of
them f h.ivy calibre. The number
of prolccMlcs r.red by the French
probably was as great.
Nothing l!ke such an expenditure ot
muntions as bee.i known before even
In the Champagne a'. tack. The whole
theory of operations was to pulverize
defenses at long range, drive out or
kill defenders and then occupy the
ground by massed rushes of infan
try. The principle of the defense was
to search out heavy pieces of tre ad
versary with equally heavy shells,
withdraw from demolished first line
works and then, when those deserted
trench works were approached by at-
tnfYi forces on the run. to catch
them with multiplied enfilading artil
lery and machine gun fire. At times
this fire was suddenly suspended and
the attackers were engaged In hand-to-hand
clashes.

ship, having lost the mate, Antonio T.
Pina. and a sailor. Fidily CeceliaL The
men were in a small boat pursuing a
whale which had been harpooned when
the quarry turned and attacked them.
The mate and Cecelia were crushed
by a blow from the whale's flukes.

COMMERCE RAIDER i
of the gold captured by
Moewe, at least, was taken from the
Appam, which put in at Newport News
several weeks ago under command of
Lieutenant Berg with a German prize
crew. It was announced in London,
however, that the value of the gold on
the Appam was less than $200,000.
Announcement was made in London
on Jan. 10 that the British battleship
King Edward VTI had been blown up
by a mine. The place at which the.
disaster occurred was not revealed by
the British admiralty. It was said no
lives were lost and only two men were
lnured.

ably were captured by the Moewe on
her way back to Germany, as their
failing dates show they were both on

been established here deftnitelv. Pris
oners from captured ships which were
transferred to the Westburn said on
their arrival at the Canarv Tltvrt

than seven inches. According to one
report, ehe was formerly a tramp

been fitted out with guns as com
merce miders. The last rreviotis re
