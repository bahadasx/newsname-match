In reply to the publication last week
by tho lirltlsh Admiralty of Instructions
for the use of armament on merchant
men, says the Overweas News ARency, i
the follow Iiir statements lire made b) I
"a comiieteiit (ierman authoilty" (
"l'or three weeks KiiKland attempted
to deny tile existence of secret onlers
for the use of armament lor ufTenMvn
purposes. Hut now- the lirltlsh Ad
miralty apparently Is compelled to rec
oRiilze the accuracy of the Ocrinan
memorandum.
"The lirltlsh Admiralty states Its In
structions were l-sued on October '.'0, ,
1 ! I Hut the steamship WoodlWd,
1 which was Peine used by the Hrltlsh
i Admiralty as a transport ship, did not
leave ICnitkind until October IS. Never
theless, she had on board Instructions
dated May 31. 191.". Therefore, It Is
, necessary to assume that the so-called
, orders of October in have only now 1
been manufactured. Apparently it also
' seems advlnable. for political reasons,
to make these orders more Reiitle or.
as the Hrltlsh Admiralty sain, to im
piove them.
"This authoiit.v further states n Is
not true tluut the uddltlou to the (ierman
prize rules of June. It'll, concedes rUhts
of resistance. The panmraph iefrted
to is; 'f mi armed hostile inetch.ititman
otfers armed leslstance against measurcH
regulated by prize law uslstanco must
be bioken by all means.'
"The new Hrltlsh Instructions contain
an order to attack every submarine
which is slRhit-1. The attempt to call
such attai !.n a measure of defence Is
pitiful. Kurtbeimore, It is nivessary to
ask how this order Is compatible witli
