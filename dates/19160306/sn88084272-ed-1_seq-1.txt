Twenty-Seven Trainloads of German Wounded Leave
Verdun Battlefield; Massacre of Germans Occurs at
Vaux; French Stubbornly Resist Attacks on Fort
Tavannes; Intense Artillery Fire Maintained.
LONDON. Eng.. March 6 The Cen
tral News correspondent at The
Hague says dispatches received
there from the front show that the
Germans are ihaking vigorous efforts
to capture Fort Tavannes, four miles
northeast of Verdun, but that the
French are resisting them resolutely,
inflicting heavy losses on the attackers.
Stubborn fighting continues near Ver
dun, the correspondent savs. The vil
lage of Vaux no longer exists. It is
also said that 27 trainloads of German
wounded have left the Verdun battle
fields for Germany.
French Regain Confidence.
Sunday was a good day for the
French at Verdun, according to in
formation received today, and public
confidence is greatly strengthened by
the oens of the continued repulse of
the German attacks. In military polit
ical circles lively satisfaction is ex
pressed regarding the situation. The
opinion now begins to prevail that the
German efforts will be more 'easily dis
posed of than was at first expressed.
