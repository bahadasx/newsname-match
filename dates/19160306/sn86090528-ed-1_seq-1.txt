The gathering of political leaders
loda has aakened a wide-spread in
i.'rcst in the selection of the district
and state delegates to the national
convention at St. Louis, and the
nomination of presidential electors
by the stae conventions that will be
held at the same time and place. Thus
far few names have been presented
for the district delegates, and only a
few hBa ben talked of for the posi
tions of delerates-at-large.
For the latter places, the names of
Governor Williams, Judge J. B. A.
Ttobertson. Senator Owen and State
Chairman Utter Melton are most fre
quently heard, but the ball has hardh
begun, and ii is probable that man'
additional names will tie suggested
before the mating of the state con
vention. The fact that each congres
sional district is entitled- to two dele
gatM and two alternates anl that ten
loyal and reputable Democrats are t'
be named for presidential e-lectorv
will afford wide opportunity for con
