INCREASED VOTE
Found That Percent of Loss Among
Disfranchised Voters In Adams
Comity (().) Is Very Small.
After closo examination statement 1b
mado that there will bo but slight
shrlnkngo In tho number of votes from
tho number disfranchised In Adams
county In the elections to bo held this
year. Tho word had gone out that of
tho 1,800 who were disfranchised by
Judgo Blair, probably half of them
had removed from tho county or had
died. The Investigation that has now
been made brings to light that the only
material loss has been created by
death. The belief prevails that Ad
nms county will cast 1,700 more votes
In the coming election than In tho last
election. This discovery has been the
causo for quickened Interest being
found at every hand, thnt correct tab
ulation may bo kept by those who will
look after the affairs of the dominant
parties.

FIGHTING CONTINUES AHOUNH
VERDUN.
Fighting of great vlolenco continues
at Douaumont In tho Verdun region,
tho British War Ornco announced
Sunday night. Tho Germans made a
heavy attack against tho French front
along tho lino from tho Haudremont
wood to Douaumont fort. This as
sault, tho statement says, was repulsed.
French- artillery officers who took
part In the battle of Verdun estimate
that during tho first four days of the
struggle the Germans discharged 2,
000,000 shells, most of them of heavy
caliber. Tho number of projectiles
fired by tho Frcncli probably was as
great. Nothing Hko such an oxpendl
turo of munitions has been known be
fore, even In the Champagne nttack.
The whole theory of operations waB to
pulvcrlzo defenses at long range, drive
out or kill defenders and then occupy
the ground by massed rushes of In
