Cjptaiu O. C. Applegate has Just
teielved u letter from Senator Lane,
in which he says:
"1 urn In receipt of our letter con-'
corning the Keating bill, which has '
1 as.ed the house, to pension survivors
of certain Indian wais. In reply !
wish to state that I intend to offer
an amendment -which will take care
of the thirty day men and those who
were wounded In the service. ' '
The Keating bill requires a mini-1
mum service of ninety days, which i
iciiulrement would exclude practically'
all the state troops nnd volunteers
who took part In the later Indian '
wjrs. These men were hurriedly or-i
r.aulred Into companies for tho pro
tection of Immigrant trains or en
dangered settlements, and though
their service was trying and danger
ous, It, wns often concluded in less
than ninety days.
Thoso inoii, "minute men" as they
cro, rendered most efficient service,
and the plnntlug of permanent settle
ments on tho Pacific Coast depended
much on their prompt action and
heroism. After all, the value of such
service should count for more than
thu mere length of time.

wars. Including service rendered prior

would bo unfair not to make the re

ment in tho sennto.
