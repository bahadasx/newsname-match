ROW BREWING
ON SEA ORDER
House and Senate Certain to
Come to Show-down on
Wilson Policy.
FORMER BELIEVED LIKELY
TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT
Report of McLemore Resolution To
day Expected to Precipitate Bitter
Fight on Floor.
Statements made yesterday by leaders
In Congress made it certain that not only
the Senate. but the House will sooner or
later declare directly for or against a
esolution warning Americans off armed
merchantmen of belligerent nations.
Tn the opinion of these,. igadera.-tbe
Touse probably will voie' Its opinion in
favor of such it warning.
Although it Is practirtily settled that
the McLemore resolution will be tabled
when the Rules Committee makes its re
rort to the House tomorrow, every Indi
catlon last night pointed to this a"tion
as not ending the matter, hut. rather,
.narkinc the beginning of a new fight on
th- floor of the lIlouse that would make
the outbreak in the Senate Friday seem
tame by comparison.
Leaders Given Score.
A scare was thrown Into adminlstration
leaders yesterday when the report spread
that the Republicans woubl vote almost
soildly against the rule to be reported h
the Riles Committe-. If enouzh anti
administration Democrats voted with the
Republicans it was realized the rule
I might be defeated.
These reports served to muddle a situa
tion already tied up In an amazing par
'lamentary tangle.
For one thing. Congressional leaders de
cided that the MeLemore resolution was
already on the table, since it was reported
to the House by the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee. The effect of the report of the
Rules Committee. therefore, would be to
recommend the tabling of a resolution al
ready tabled.
To relieve this situation, it was planned
to have Chairman Flood, of the Foreign
Relations Committee, move today to lift
the McLemore resolution from the table
and place it or the calendar.
Would Reverse Action.
The adoption of the Rules Committee
report tomorrow would reverse the
process by taking the resolution from
the calendar and placing it again on the
table.
When the scare over the defeat of the
rule arose yesterday, many administra
tion leaders Questioned the wisdom of
placing the McLemore resolution on the
calendar while any danger existed of the
defeat of the Rules Committee report.
This move may be delayed until a poll
is taken to establish definitely just what
the vote on the rule will be.
Meanwhile. Mr. Bryan is expected back
in Washington today, He will confer
with several of his supporters in the
House. but his friends insist he will not
attempt to defeat the tabling of the Mc
Lemore resolution.
Another cause for worry is that mem
bers of Congress are beginning to hear
from home.
