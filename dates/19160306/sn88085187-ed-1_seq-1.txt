Germans Swoop Down In Greatest Air Raid
SOUND VESSEL IS DISMASTED OFF FLATTERY
Builds Up a $500,000
Farm Near Tacoma By
Parcel Post Marketing
A. li. Hi-own, "Parrel Post Farmer," on hi- Kentucky thoroughbred.
Have you boon told that "Western Washington is no place to farm"?
Well, it isn't so.
Did yon know that a "bum lawyer," as he called himself, in the last few
years had taken over a slrelch of swamp land near Tacoma and now lias
Iransformed it into a half-million dollar property?
Probftbly yon didn't, because this remarkable farm hasn't heretofore
broken into the limelight a great deal.
You'll be surprised perhaps to know that it was PARCEL POST MAR
KETING that brought about this result.
How it happened is another INDUSTRIAL ROMANCE.
We have had one of our staff members, Jack .Jiingnieyor, searching out
Just such enthralling stories as these for several months now.
Yon recall his mighty instructive articles on ihe co-operative lumber
camps, on the Puyallup ■ Sumner Fruit Growers' association, and on the hali
but industry.
Well, this one is the best yet, because it hasn't broken into print before.
It is chock full of inspiration and helpfulness to every man and woman,
whether on the farm, in the office or in the kitchen.
if you plan on going back to the land, here's a story you'll peruse with
profit.
If you want a few hunches on how to make the pennies grow into dollars
you cannot afford to miss reading about Farmer Brown's use of system.
Even if you are only interested in following what other successful men
have made of their opportunities, you'll be warmed up by getting acquainted
Kith the man who created the PARCEL POST FARM.
A. L. Brown is the man who did it, and Nisqually, midway between Ta
coma and Olympia, is the location of his great property.
Jack Jungmeyer's entertaining story of the farm and how it was devel
oped will appear in The Times beginning tomorrow. Watch for the first in
stallment.

The latest estimates placed the
combined losses of the two armies
at over 200,000. The dead are

Berlin declares the Germans
have captured between 80 and
100 square miles of territory ln

Sunday's battle was the fiercest
at Pepper plateau. Following
two hours of unprecedented ar
tillery fire, three German bri
gades advanced in a headlong
charge. French rifle, mitrail

Germans, and the foremost ranks
were riddled.
Others, Paris declared, halted
at the rear in confusion, pre

Caught thus, (he Germans were
slaughtered where they crouched,

When a pretty child grows ip

won't frighten the horses or send

Whiskers are extremely er

never grow on red-haired men.
