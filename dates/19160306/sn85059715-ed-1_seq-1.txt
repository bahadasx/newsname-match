LONDON, Murcli 0.?Important
movements of German troops in Belgium
nre reported In n Central News
despatch from The Hague. It Is said
information has reached The Hague
from Maastricht, Holland, that 40,000
German cavalrymen of the Landstrum,
are one their way to the front
near Ypres.

PARIS. March 6?There was no
infantry fighting north of Verdun,
last night, the war office announced
today.
Yesterday was a good day for the :
French at Verdun. Public confldenco
is greatly strengthened by the news
of continued repulses of the German
attacks. In military and political
circles lovely satisfaction is expressed
regarding the situation and the
opinion now begins to prevail that
the great effort of the Germans will
be more easily disposed of than was
at first expected.
Having foiled to make any impression
on the Dou&umont positions, and
on the Vaux to its right, the German
general staff determined to
smash the French left on the Vaclierauville
wood, Cote Du Polvre position.
Without regard to cost the
best troope were hurled forward but
with no more success than elsewhere.
Pomeranians and what was
left of the Bradenburgers dashed
themselves vainly against the French
who stood as immovable as a rock
wall.
As at Vaux, the Germans finally
fell back leaving heaps of dead on
the ground. The French Infantry j
supported by their formidable artll- i
lery which will never henceforth s
lack ammunition, showed themselves t
A KIA Ik AWAMV Anslfttlffkl Aw

~ the left bank of the Meuse, artillery i
on both sides thundered all day long. I
The French Infantry In that section
had little to do but It remains there
ready for any eventuality although
the military experts believe It is extremely
doubtful that the .Germans
will attempt to storm the Morthomme
key position, for to do so they
must deploy over a plain a mile wide
under cross Are from the heights
around.
It Is chiefly the French artillery .
which is Involved In the Woevro I
fighting. The French hold the outskirts
of the village of Manheulles
firmly and have stopped all attempts
of the Germans to debouch in that
direction.
An Idea of the relative small per- (
centage of French casualties In the ]
veraun oattie is considered as aeducible
from a statement made by a
lieutenant, who has arrived here
wounded. "Our losseB," he said, "are
comparatively slight. My regiment,
for Instance, has only forty-seven
killed and thirty-five wounded. This
Is small for a unit which has been
acting as support and which was engaged
In the most violent of the
fighting."

LONDON. March 6.?The British
