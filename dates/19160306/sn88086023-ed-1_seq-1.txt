N Teal, prominent Portlandcr and
"Father" Of the open river movement,
has written to County Judge Marsh
upon the subject. In his letter Mr.
Teal sets forth the fact the river can
not be of service unless there are
roads connecting with the waterway
and ho predicts that such roads when
built will actually pay for themselves
through savings in freight costs.
Mr. Teel's letter Is as follow:
March 4, 1916.
Hon fj II Marsh, County Judge,
Pendleton, Oregon.
Dear Sir: I have been observing
with considerable Interest the good

purposes to bo raised by a bond is

keenest personal Interest In the devel

but of the Interior generally, and feel
that 1 am Justified in making some
suggestions In connection with a mat

couty as good roads and their loca

Umatilla county being a great pro
ducing section, largely or farm pro

vital factor, one would nuturally as
