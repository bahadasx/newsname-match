SENATE VOTE MAY
LESSEN BREAK WITH
GERMANY, SAYS BERLIN
Berlin, March 6.Well informed
Americans here claim that the sen
ate's vote of confidence in the presi
dent has lessened the possibilities of
a German-American break. There is
a wide difference in interpreting the
meaning of the senate's action. It is
generally thought that it means that
the president will be given a free
hand to make negotiations with Ger
many, calling on the senate only in
case war is planned.
Washington, March 6.Olney Ar
nold, United States diplomatic agent
and consul general at Cairo, Egypt,
is dead at Lisbon, Portugal.

Berlin, March 6.(Official)The

APPROPRIATE MONEY
FOR COUNTY FAIR
The board of Beltrami county com
missioners has appropriated $600 to
the Beltrami County Fair association
for use this year.
The board also appropriated $500
for the Beltrami county exhibit at
the Minnesota state fair and appoint
ed Bueford M. Gile as manager of the
exhibit at a salary of $100, to be
taken out of the fund appropriated.
THREE IMPORTANT
FACTORS IN BIG
FOREIGN SITUATION
Washington, March 6.Three im
portant factors developed 4oday in
the delicate international situation.
They are:
Colonel House's return from a sec
ret European mission to tell the
president what he learned.
German decree against armed mer
chantmen and the photographic
copies of alleged secret British or
ders to merchantment to attack sub
marines.
The presence of William Jennings
Bryan at the capitol.
Pioneer advertisements are re
liable.
WOULDN'T THIS CHILL YOU?
The idea is spreading that the
year 1916 will be summerless.
The year 1816, after the disas
trous end of Napoleonic wars, had
scarcely enough summer to be worth
mentioning, and the theory seemed
to be that the terrific bombardments
on European battlefields are bound
to have a similar effect upon weather
conditions this year.
June of 1816, so the story goes,
was a month of frost and ice. New
England, Ohio and Pennsylvania
were covered with snow.
June 17 there was a great snow
storm and flocks of sheep were over
whelmed and suffocated.
The ice was an inch thick on the
Fourth of July, and August 20 wit
nessed a heavy fall of $now.
Not until after September were the
climatic conditions restored.
The notion is that history will re
peat itself after the passage of a
century, and the alarnnng thought
in this connection is thrall the Na
poleonic wars caused the de
rangement of meteorlogical condi
tions, then the amount used in the
present war is likely to keep the
temperature at 40 below zero at least
all next summer.
ROBBERS BREAK

Unlocked,
i
WORK OF AMATEURS
POLICE INVESTIGATING
Money Taken From Secret Drawer
Other Funds in Cash Registers
Are Overlooked.
Robbers early this morning en
tered the Barker Drug store and stole
$25 The loss was discovered short
ly after the store was opened for
business this morning.
Break Latent^
The robbers gained admittance to
the store through a back window,
taking off the storm window and
cutting a hole in the sash so that
they were able to lift the catch. That
the robbery took place only a short
time before the store was opened
was evident as tracks in the snow
were still discernable.
Funds Overlooked.
About $20 belonging to the Moose
lodge was taken from the bookkeep
er's desk and five dollars was taken
from the front cash register. An at
tempt was made to open the big cash
register with a screw driver, but no
money was taken from other regis
ters which all contained money.
Familiar With Store.
It is believed that the robbers were
familiar with the store and familiar
with the place where the $20 was
located. It is thought probable that
someone during the day, while up
in the bookkeeper's office, noticed
the $20 in the desk.
The work is believed to have been
that of amateurs.
The police are investigating.
FEDERAL INSPECTION

even of 1914, was famed at Minne

$8,000 for the protection of the for
ests outside the national forests

cepted as a recognition of the effi
ciency of the state service in pro
tecting woodlands.

LATEST SAYS DISPATCH
An aeroplane neck is the latest,
according to the St. Paul Dispatch.
Symptoms are visions of moving

sound as of a motor turning rap
idly.
The Dispatch article in part says:
According to the aeroplane branch
of the health corps, the epidemic is
most severe around Bemidji. The
city is dry under the Indian treaty.
Various efforts have been made to
smuggle in liquor, but to no avail.
They have a clue, the corres
pondent wires. Lewis Carroll's words
are recalled:
The time has come, the walrus said,
To talk of many things,
Of shoes, of ships and sealing wax.
Of cabbages and kings,
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings.
The nightly visitor in a flying
blind pig, is one theory.
