BIG VAULT DOOR
AT STATE HOUSE
REFUSESTO OPEN
State of Kansas Is Shnt Ont
From Its Valuables.
i Clock Which Operates the Time
Lock Has Stopped.
$21,000,000 IN SECURITIES
Are Beyond the Reach of
Treasurer Earl Akers.
May Be Necessary to Call Ex
perts From Lansing.
Kxpert yeggmen and electricians
may be required to open the big vault
In the office of Earl Akers, state treas
urer. The big safe refused to open at
the appointed time today and it is be
lieved that the clock which operates
the time lock has stopped. Securties
worth 21 million dollars are in the
vault.
Apprehension was felt in all tate
departments this afternoon when an
expert declared that the clock which
operates the vault's time lock, had
stopped running. Not until Tuesday
nfbrning will the state make another
effort to open the big safe. If at that
time it is impossible to open the giant
money box. experts will be called to
the assistance of the state treasurer.
It is even probable that several pro
fessional yeggmen in the state peni
tentiary at Lansing will be brought to
Topeka at display their ability.
A 11 of the state's valuable records
are locked in the safe. That the state's
troubles might not be discounted,
Treasurer Akers this afterpnoon point
ed to the fact that the state had just
started its annual inventory of assets.
The books and records are now be
hind the fire and burglar proof vaults
and all efforts to open the safe have
failed.
Money in Another Vault.
The state's supply of currency for
daily use was kept in another vault
and Treasurer Akers was today able
to meet the daily demands for cash.
Another day's tie up, however, will oc
casion embarrassment In all depart
ments. In the meantime not a bond
or coupon held by the state can be
reached.
It is believed that when the treas
urer's office was closed Saturday aft
ernoon that an assistant forgot to
wind the clock which operates the
time lock. Again, it is possible that
the dial was not changed and that
proper provision was not made for the
opening of the vault this morning.
Akers waited until noon today for
the vault to respond. Then he sent
for a man with a stethoscope. The
instrument failed to assure the expert
that the clock had not stopped. But
Akers is yet undecided.
"1 will wait until Tuesday morn
ing," he said. "If the vault cannot
be opened at that time, we will send
for experts."
It is possible that yeggmen from the
state prison will be given a chance to
demonstrate their ability. Akers,
however, doubts If there is a man at
Lansing with sufficient cunning to
open the vault.
On but one former occasion in fif
teen years has the state been kept
from the vault for a period of more
than a few hours. One day last sum
mer the time locks on the vault re
fused to work promptly and a delay of
several hours was suffered. Nearly
ten years ago it was necessary' to start
the dials with a battering ram.
TWICE AS MANY FIRES
The Number This Year Is Double That

Up to noon today there had been
just double the number of fires re

'Damn 9 No Longer
Swear Word,
Students Assert
Cambridge, Mass., March 6.
"Damn" is no longer considered a
swear word at Harvard.
A group of students specializing
in numismatics have discovered
that the Persians years ago had a
coin, the dam, the smallest they
had in size and the worthlessness
of which is exceeded only by Mex

Consequently the Persian
bloods got into the habit of say
ing they did not give a dam about
this or that to show their indif
ference. The word was later
adopted into the English language.
BABIES RECEIVE
ATTENTION FROM
COUNTRY TODAY
This Is First Day of "Baby
Week" in United States.
Topeka and Kansas Sharing
Responsibilities of Occasion.
EVERY CITY TAKES A PART
Household Hygiene Instruction
for Mothers Here.
.After This Dr. DeVillbiss Will
Carry on Campaign.
Kansas did it last October, and now
everybody's "doin it," and Kansas Is
doing it again. It is "baby week" in
the whole United States. Topeka in
cluded. Hundreds of communities,
representing every' state In the Union,
will think especially about babies this
week; they will hear lectures about
babies, and it is expected that the re
mainder of the year will be marked by
a strengthening of all community ac
tivities for saving babies lives and giv
ing them a better chance to grow to
healthy maturity.
Six months ago a proportion of
Kansas people, and especially male
citizens, were sneering about "a skin
ny old maid who was to come to Kan
sas to teach mothers how to feed and
bathe babies." Aside from the fact
that the imported head of the child
hygiene department, Dr. Lydia DeVil
biss, is neither skinny nor an old maid,
and that Kansas mothers, as well as
all other mothers, can profitably be
taught the proper care of babies by a
highly trained specialist, that bit of
sarcasm was entirely appropos. "The
mere fact of maternity," Dr. DeVilbiss
said this morning, "is a great experi
ence, we all grant, but there is noth
ing about it that gives any woman any
particular knowledge or guidance in
the proper care of a young baby. She
has to learn, and the object of 'baby
week' is to disseminate such knowl
edge among the mothers and fathers
of the state and the nation."
In Topeka.
In Topeka, the Good Government
( -lub, thT' Federation of Women, the
merchants and the School of House
hold Economics, now in session at the
auditorium, is co-operating.
The babies will not he entered in a
judging contest this week. a that was
done in Topeka last October, but lec
tures are being given each day of the
economics school, and every afternoon
in the rest room at the Warren M.
Crosby store. The Pelletier store is
observing baby week with windows
decorated for the occasion, and pho
tographs of the babies taken at one
of the local photographer shops will
be given by the store. Tuesday aft
ernoon and Friday afternoon the store
wiil give baby partie from two to five,
and will serve ice cream to the babies
and their mothers.
Mother's Influence.
At a meeting this morning at the
auditorium at 9:30 o'clock Dr. De
Vilbiss made an address on "The Care
of the Young Mother and the Child."
"The question begins away back in
the matter of heredity, and it has late
ly been discovered that the mother
influences the moral and intellectual
nature of her child very greatly, in
stead of being the 'passive host," as
she was formerly considered.
"If women live in a state of su
pine subjection in married life, the
race suffers by the children she bears,
who will be a non-progressive, diffi
dent, supine set of men and women.
The care of the young child and the
mother should be both pre-natal and
post-natal. The first thing to consider
is whether or not the mother is well
nourished and if she has sufficient
food.
"Nature is partial to the child, and
the baby is a successful parasite. If
there is not sufficient nourishment for
both, the child gets the best for its
growth and development. But if fresh
air and proper food are not furnished,
both suffer. Cleanliness is another
matter of vast importance, and so is
the matter of exercise. The woman
who lies around munching chocolates
and bemoaning her fate is not nearly
so well oft as the woman who does a
normal amount of house work and
takes moderate, regular exercise."
Dr. DeVilbiss spoke at considerable
length on the proper food for babies.
"The bottle fed babies die at the rate
of ten to one, faster then breast fed
babies."
She showed the impossibility of sub
stituting any food as suitable as the
babies' natural diet, by explaining the
chemical makeup of milk, and the
difference to be found in the different
species of animals, and the various
ways in which the protein and the fat
act in various animals.
Dr. DeVilbiss says that in order to
determine a decrease or increase in
the percentage of infant mortality, a
period of about four years should be
considered.
"No healthy, happy baby is such an
exception to the great rule that it is
a rare possession. It is our hope to
create such conditions that all babies
may be healthy and happy, that all
may be proud possessions. Babies
have not been highly enough valued.
They must be made an asset and not, a
liability to the state. The institution
for the blind in Kansas City is costing
the state an enormous sum every year,
thousands of dollars, whereas a solu
tion costing five cents a treatment
could have prevented nearly every
case of blindness in that institution."
Mortality in State.
The mortality among the babies of
this state is appalling. In the year
1915 there were 2,598 deaths of babies
less than one year old in the state of
Kansas. Of this number about 1,300
were from what are known as pre
ventable causes that is, through ig
norance or carelessness. .1. W V.
Deacon, of the state board of health.

a hotel near the capitol. A boot 20
members of congress were invited,
most of whom are strong advocates of
