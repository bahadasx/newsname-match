ITU liltK.VT IXTENMTY
l'AKIS, March .j.?According to semi
oflii'ial advicea, tho fighting at Verdun
continued yesterday throughout tlm
iln.y with th? same Intensity and with
out causing any change in the respec
tiv" positions of (he opposing armies.
Kirrhting Is -?*<ill going on for rieflnit>4
po.-si.ssion of tin* village of Pouau
niont.
The situation, as a result of this
11<l phase of the German offensive,
is regarded as altogether different
from tlti- days of the preceding battle.
The heaviest lighting by the Genua ns
\wir- during the first two days of the
second attach. For the last forty,
eight hours thoy have not advanced
Th.- comparison also is in favor of
I In Ktviioh. by reason of the fact that
tin- Germans now have lost the ad
vantage of surprise, and also because
th?> ground lias boon torn up to such
an extent that it cannot be organized
properlj.
This infoi ni.uion from semiofficial
i'iri les points out thai it must be de
moralizing to tho Germans to see ;;onie
iiI.imm) in ,0.000 corpses of their rom ?
ilying before the Wrench lines.
Itc-enfor cements hronuht tip by th*
Germans since the inauguration of th".
second phas?? ?(f tin- battle on Wedncs
daj ii r" estimated here at 250.000, rais
ing t lie total forces utilized by the
assailants to more than ,">00,000. Esti
mates of losses show wide variance
I>etntls of local actions and the size
of the reserve forces iirought up calls !
I'l'-ie h observers to make the deduc
tion that the Germans have paid ?
\ ei y l\cav\ price for the six square
mile- ni i-roMud they have gained.

In flout of the village of Vaux alone
1.000 Herman coi*?s?-.-> wer*- counted
after the eighth unsuccessful attack.
This par' of the battle, though over
shadowed i?> the fight for 1 ?ouauniont,
is regarded m Paris as a serious check
fur the attackers. The Germans car
ried on tin assault with groat courage
until I lie dead lay thick on the Held.
Then the officers. it is .said, were com
pelled to urge .in the troops as they
clambered over the < orpset: of their
fallen comrades for the last assaults.
The attack on \ .tux began on tho
evening of Match -. after a ftirioua
she llinir. and continued until the fol
lowing night, .oliiiiic- of German; ad
