Cleveland, Mar. 6. Newton D.
Baker, former mayor of Cleveland,
nnouneod today that he had accept
ed President Wilson's oftor of the
secretary of war portfolio.
Chlraio, Mar. 6. "That' bully,"
exclaimed Vice-President Marshall
today, when informed Newton D.
Baker, of Cleveland, had been ap
pointed secretary of war. Marshall
la a close personal friend and fra
ternity brother of Baker. He said:
"With due reverence for the other
candidates, Baker Is the best man for
the Job, A man unexperienced In
military matters will make a better
secretary Jban a eoldler tor various
"reasons. He Is more likely to listen
to advice." ; ; , ;'. .''
Baker said:
"1 have accepted. ' I do not know
when I will go to Washington, but
It will be within a week. The ex
pression of President Wilson's confi
dence In me carried toy the appoint
ment la certainly most flattering.
"Of course, I know nothing of the
duties of the office and have all to
learn." ;. -
Baker always has been known as
a pacifist At a recent meeting ot
cltltcns he was boosted as the man
to bring peace In Europe when the
time Is ripe. Asked when be had
ceased to be a paclfls, and became an
advocate .of preparedness, Baker said:
"I am still a member la good stand
ing of several peace societies."
"But you believe in President Wll
on'a 'preparedness' policy?" he was
aaked. '
Yes. I believe In all his policies
aa far aa 1 know them."
When the difference between the
president and congress on the pro
position of passing resolutions warn
ing Americans to avoid armed liners
first developed, Baker wired to Sen
ator Pomerene: t
"My opinion la wholly with the
president. He will doubtless save
the country'! honor. Out can not
something be done to save the party,
which at present is a dismal failure?"
With regard to the senate vote,
tabling the Core warning resolution,
Baker ald quietly: '
"I am sure no European power wlir
misinterpret that action."
Baker heard the news ot hli ap
pointment while conducting a case In
the court of common pleas. The In
formation hardly caused a ripple in
the decorum of the court. '
. "I have long been a joace a al
most any price man," said Baker.
"The first step toward Insuring In
ternational peace would be, I foellove,
the establishment ot a world peace
court as Tho Hague tribunal pro
vided, but never executed, as there
was no agreement of all nations re
garding its constitution.
"1 shall continue to bo a member
of peace societies, for I believe that
peace must oome through the courts
of law. ' ,
, "The question of preparedness Is
now under congressional considera
tion. It would be Improper for me
to express an opinion on It. 1 can'

Newton Dlohl Baker retired as
mayor of Cleveland January 1, after
four years of service In that office.
His first experience In public life was
In Washington as private secretary
to Postmaster General William L.
Wilson, In Grover Cleveland's second
administration. Wilson came from
Baker's state, West Virginia, but af
ter the election of McKlnley to the
presidency Baker moved to Cleveland,
and became Junior law partner to a
close friend ot Tom L. Johnson, after
ward the famous "people's mayor"
ot Cleveland. Johnson was attracted
by the young man, and when In 1901
Johnson became mayor, he had
Baker named aa assistant city solici
tor. Shortly afterward Baker became
city solicitor and served In that office
until Johnson was defeated In 1909.
In 1911 Baker himself was elected
mayor of Cleveland and was re
elected In 1918. He was not a can
didate In the election of 1915, when
his party went out of municipal office
In Cleveland. t ,
Baker Is a' studious, small, spec
tacled man. He Is notod In his home
city as having no Intimate friends,
preferring to bury himself in bis
study when not engaged in public
business. His friendship for Presi
dent Wilson dated from Baker's fight
In the national democratic conven
tion in Baltimore, when he made the
fight against the unit rule that prac
tically Insured Wilson's nomination.
Baker led the minority of the Ohio
delegation that favored Wilson.
Baker was born December t, 1871,

Teuton Army Withdraws After
Reverse in Assault Upon
French Center, and Lull
Follows h Battle for Verdun
London, Mar. 6. Official announce
ments from both Paris and Berlin to
day Indicated that, following the re
pulse ot the Germans on the Douau
mont plateau, where they concen
trated their attacks on the French
center, Teuton corps withdrew and
did not attempt any fresh assaults
last night. It Is believed that no
more advances will bo launched In
that region until plenty ot heavy ar
tillery Is available to support the In
fantry. Elsewhere around Verdun infan
try fighting almost ceased during the
night. O
On the east bank of the Meuse,
north of Verdun, Berlin said there
were minor operations, which result
ed in the capture of 14 French officers
and 934 'men. Paris did not men
tion this, dismissing all Infantry en
gagements with the statement that
they were "unimportant"
There waa, however, severe artil
lery battling on the left bank of the
Meuse, west ot Douaumont and 6a the
Woevre plain. Jn the Choppy woods
and alongthe Avoricourt-Malancourt
road Gorman positions were swept
with heavy artillery shells all night,
thongh no attempt waa made to seise
those wroks which suffered from the
continuance of the explosion!.
