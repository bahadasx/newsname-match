The present trip will result in the

therefore Is most directly interested
In populating the state. On this ac
count the company is now fathering
the greatest advertising campaign un
dertaken in its history to promote the
occupancy of farm lands in this state.
Three large colonies from Iowa and
Minnesota have bought lands In Elko
county and are preparing to Invade
Nevada carrying the banner of pros
perity. These settlers, who come well
financed by their own money to begin
right in a new country are already
clamoring for literature to distribute
among their friends.
The advertising campaign Is con
ducted under the direction of Mr. C.
K. Wantiand, general sales agent, who
with his staff will meet Mr. Martin
at Reno this evening to map out the
work of letting the world know that
Nevada is in the market for the men
and women who are willing to lay the
foundation of rapid wealth making.
Three years ago Mr. Wantiand pre
dicted that inside of ten years this
state would be harvesting a wheat
crop of 10,000,000 bushels a year. Since
then the production has trebled and
the next five years is likely to witness
the fulfillment of the prophecy, al
though at the time of Its utterance
the author was openly derided by Home
of the best posted authorities who still
clung to the belief that Nevada was
only fit for cattle and sheep ranges
and that the real farmer would always
be a by-product of these industries

ONE QUART OF WHI8KEY
TO BE VIRGINIA LIMIT
Will the miiws of Nevada be compelled to close down as a re
sult of the greed of the powder trust? That Is a question that Is agitat
ing mine operators, not only In Tonopah, but throughout the state.
A gigantic trust has been formed, the opportunity being offered by
the European war. The little companies have been bid in by the big
companies and the big companies have formed a combination which
makes the bathtub trust look like what the canary laves In.
A' Tonopah operator said to the Bonanza this morning: "I was
pleased to note the knock which you put in against the powder com
panies several" days ago when they boosted dynamite an additional
three cents, but you didn't go far enough.
"I am one of the smaller operators and when the war started I was
buying powder In such small lots that it cost me 15 cents a pound.
The big fellows, who were ordering by wholesale, got it for 14 cenls.
Now there have been three jumps and we are all paying 23 cenls and
no one knows when the screws will be put on again.
"Do you realize that In some workings powder costs more than
men! I have a heading that takes 40 pounds of powder for a round.
At 23 cents that costs JM.20. The drill man Is paid M 50 for his shirt
and the mucker $4, making 70 cents less than the cost of the powder.
"And this has nothing to do with the price of fuse which is the
highest in history, while the cost of fulminate of murcury, now un
paralled, has put I he price of caps up a couple of hundred percent.
"In the face of all this, the powder companies are paying big dlvl-.
dends an their stock is creating fortunes for its owners. It really
mnkes a fellow ashamed that he hitherto voted the Democratic ticket "

MR. BRYAN OPPOSED
TO PREPAREDNESS
MAKES HEADQUARTERS IN THE
VERY SHADOW OF THE GREAT
WHITE DOME t
(By Aanorlnlrd Prr.)
TOKIO, Mar. 6. From a great
power Japan has become a world
power, and the nations of the west
can no longer make light of Japan's
strength, particularly of her preemin
ent position and immense influence in
the affairs of the far east, according
to Premier Count Okuma In an arti
cle in his popular monthly, New
Japan.
He calls his contribution "Japan's
New Position in the World's Diplo
macy." In a general way it bears out
the feeling of observers in the Orient
that Japan's policy of the future will!
be that of trying to play the pre
dominating role in China on account
of her power and special position and
interests.
He says: "Japan, which half a cen
tury ago was an insignificant and mere
Island empire, isolated in a corner of
the extreme east, has now become one
of the world's powers and come to
sway a great Influence. Japan finds
herself with Great Britain, the United
States, Germany, France and Rusgia
and every move mad. by Japan af
fects In some way or other the Inter
ests of those great nations and reflects
on the situation of the world. Even
Great Britain, which took pride in
her world-wide Influence and stuck
to her favorite traditional policy of
'honored isolation' was compelled to
oooJMto" an offensive and defensive
alliance with Japan, casting aside her
national pride of 'Isolated indepen
dence' a proof that Britain recogniz
ed the greatness of Japan's national
activity and future ascendancy. The
great work and rapid development
Japan achieved in the comparatively
short period of half a century after
the country's opening to international
intercourse favorably compares and
competes with the progress and de
velopment attained by the occidental
countries through several centuries
and after hard laborious experience
of wars and revolutions."
He points out that adhesion to the
London peace agreement by which
the entente allies mutually promised
to make peace only In common gives
Japan the right of speech at the peace
conference to be held at the conclu
sion of the war not only on questions
pertaining to the Orient but also on
matters concerning the Balkans, the
disposition of the colonies of the
powers in Africa, and their territories
In the Pacific in fact, on all problems
that may arise, on equal footing with
the other great world powers.
The. premier concludes: "In short,
Japan's participation in the London
agreement makes her an important
element In the maintenance of the
balance of power In the world. Prac
tically, peace east of Suez has been
and is maintained by Japan. Our
nation has come to sway a great
power by which we can control the
peace or disorder of Asia and effect
the iaaue of the great Euroiean war."

NO SPOOFING ABOUT
THIS INDOOR GAME
When the Elks and the Moose play
ed the initial gsme of indoor baseball
for sweet charity it was a case ot
locking horns, but now that the Moose
have the Eagles for their antagonists,
it is a matter of antlers against talons
and it will require quick perception,
psychological ingenuity, prescience,
incffersilillity of connuolatlng persi
flage and a lot of other qualities to tell
who will come out on top.
Best see the game yourself. It will
be played' at. the Airdome tomorrow
evening and will cost only two bits,
one quarter of a dollar, a shillln' or
five jitneys, according as you figure
money. Afterwards it will cost ten
cents a dance and seven musicians to
fiddle, toot and thump for you. R
member, all the money taken in goes
for the relief of the unfortunate. You
will not be unfortunate If you attend.
