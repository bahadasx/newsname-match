GREAT VICTORY FOR

Others Under Fire Granted
Dauphin county courts this after
noon dealt the rum traffic the stiffest
blow of years by refusing applications
for the re-licensing of three city ho
tels. transfers of two others and one I
applicant for a new hostelry.
The request for liquor selling privi- j
leges in one hoiei in the country re- j
fused last year, was granted by the I

Washington streets; R. Leslie
Potter, proprietor.
Hotel Savoy. James J. MeClel--
ian, 143-45 South Third street.
Hotel \ldinc, Edwin S. Miller.

Transfers for long-established hos
telries which were refused' were the
applications of Fred W. Ebel. proprie
tor of the National Hotel. Fourth and i
State streets, who wanted to move to
1802 North Fourth street. Eleventh
ward, and Renjamm A. Striplin, pro
prietor of the Lcroy, 323 State street,
who wanted to move to 945 North
Seventh street.
The only new applicant was Sam
uel Fish man who wanted the liquor
privilege at the Lennox, 424-28 Mar
ket street.
William H. Bowman, proprietor of
the St. Lawrence," Berrysburg, was the
only new hostelry added to Dauphin
county's list. The licensing of this
place was refused last year.
Heal Reasons For Refusal

Constable Haines Shot in
Leg by Jealous Wife
Because she believed her husband,
James W. Haines. aged 40, 21C South
Second street, Steeiton, was paying- at
tentions to Mrs. Wiley A. Kllßore, of
1505 North Fifth street, Mrs. Lillian
Haines shot him in the right leg last
evening, at Fifth and Holly streets,
within a short distance of the home
of Mrs. Klleore.
Haines, who is an ex-co'nslable of
the Second ward of Steelton, is in the
Harrlsburg Hospital, but his condition
is not serious. After Mrs. Haines had
shot her husband, she fell unconscious
and was Riven medical treatment at a
house nearby. Haines walked to the
hospital and was admitted for treat
ment. It is said that just before the
shooting, Mrs. Haines and Mrs. Kil
gore were arguing in the street, and
that Haines turned the corner while
they were talking. As he walked up,
Mrs. Haines fired. The ex-constable's
son, Raymond Haines, was one of the
first on the scene. He is a caller for
the Pennsylvania railroad. It is be
lieved that the police will take no ac
tion in the affair.

When the big Baby Welfare Exhibit opens next week, mothers of Harrisburg and vicinity will get expert advice
on the care of the little sunbeams that are cooing—and now and then crying—about their homes. The welfare exhibit
will teach the mothers how they can prevent much of the Tying. And there, dad! is a tip for you on how to spend your
nights asleeping instead of walking o'er the nursery floor.
The picture shows the girls of the Reading high school studying Infant care. It is just possible that the idea may
spread to the Harrlsburg High School, although Dr. F. E. Downes, superintendent, says that he has no action along
this line in mind at present.
AUSTRIA AT WAR j
WITH SMALLEST
STATE IN WORLD
Little, 1.000 Year Old Republic
of San Marino Is Drawn
Into Conflict
By Associated Press
Home. March 5. via Paris, March 6.
—Austria considers herself at war
with the republic of San Marino, is
the message conveyed by Frederick C.
Penfield, American ambassador to
Austria-Hungary, to the regents of
the smallest State in the world, who
had applied through him to have
their citizens interned in Austria re
leased. Austria justified her refusal
with the statement that San Marino
has committed a serious breach of
neutrality.
The republic of San Marino in
northern Italy, 14 miles southwest of
Rimini, is 22 square miles in area
and has a population of 9,500. The
supreme power of the republic re
sides in the general assembly and it is
governed by two regents selected
twice a year from the sixty life mem
bers of the tireat council. The avail
able armed forced of the republic form
a total of 1,200 men. all citizens able
to bear arms, being technicallv obliged
to do so from the ages of 16 to 60
years. This little State has had an
existence of 1,000 years. The nature
of the serious breach of neutrality
which Austria alleges that San Marino
has committed is not recorded. Soon
after the declaration of war by Italy
on Austria it was rumored that San ;
Marino had made a similar declara- i
tion, but this was never confirmed.

Outright by Dropping of
Forty Bombs
loniion, March «.—Twelve per
sons were killed and thirty-three
injured in Inst night's Zeppelin
raid. Three Zcpix-lins took part
in the attack. This information
was Riven out officially to-day.
The statement follows:
"After crossing the coast the air- j
ships took various courses, and from j
the devious nature of their flight ap
parently were uncertain as to their |
bearings. The area visited Included j
Yorkshire, IJncolnshire, Rutland, !
Huntingdin, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk,
Essex and Kent.
"As far as is known, about forty
bombs were dropped altogether. The 1
casualties so far as ascertained amount j

dren: Injured, 33. The material dam- j
age was: Two terrace houses prac- {
tically destroyed, one office, one public :
house, a cafe and several shops partly I
destroyed and a block of almshouses !
badly damaged."
The censor permits publication of a I
few incidents in connection with the
eppelin raid. In one of the principal
areas visited a block of workmen's!
dwellings was demolished. A woman
and her four children, all under nine j
j years, were killed. The woman's i

French Lines Hold Firm
Against Desperate Assaults
Around Douaumont
With the French center in the

holding firm against the desperate as

the Germans are again turning their j
attention to the flanks of the French
positions around the stronghold.
| Intense artillery activity in the
Woevre region was reported in the

upon the regions of Haudomont and

Paper Famine May Hit
Printers and Publishers

Washington, March 6. Higher
prices will follow the increased freight
rates on news print paper awarded
j here on Saturday to the railroads from
i mills in New Yqrk and New England
• to various points East of the Mississ
i ippi. The new rate is to be twenty
cents a hundred.
j Paper manufacturers represented
I here say that the new rate only com
-1 plicates a very serious situation in
j the paper market. No paper or paper
' pulp of any kind As being imported,
j on account of the war, and on the con
trary paper pulp is being shipped
from this country to England and
I France, where it is being used in the
! manufacture of munitions. Another
disturbing feature has been the pur
chase of immense quantities of rags
j in this country by the powder makers
j who are using them as a substitute
I lor new cotton.
Paper prices are going by leaps and
| bounds, and this in the face of a
j greater demand for all kinds of print
paper than the country has ever be
, fore known. The better grades of
paper are most affected but a news
print famine of large and serious
I proportions is expected by early
I summer. The situation is pronounced
I very grave.
