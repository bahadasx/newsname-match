I . ployment for 500 Persons.
II On last Saturday evening, action
LJ -was taken by the principal stockhold
ers of the Ogden Packing & Provision
company authorizing the expenditure
of 300,000 in making improvements
on the company's plant west of the
viaduct on Twenty-fourth street, and
at the same time plans were complet

of $250,000, of which $100,000 is to be
expended immediately in the con
structing of modern stockyards on 70
acres of ground just west of the pack
'1 ing plant, across Weber river.
J These two expenditures mean that
Ogden is to be indisputably the pack
3 ing house and livestock center of the
1 west, as the packing plant will be en
ao larged to a capacity beyond anything
hej west of Omaha and the stockyards

ft With the building of packing houses
and yards, Ogden will give employ-
ment to 500 persons in the preparing
of meats for the market and stock
buyers representing all the large pack- ,
I ers in the United States will make
this their headquarters. There will
( be killed in the local plant 1000 hogs,
1 1500 sheep and 300 head of cattlo each
S day, representing in livestock and
3 dressed beef 47 carloads moving m
, and out of Ogden every 24 hours.
1 The 1000 hogs will require 12 cars;
the dressed product of 150,000 pounds,
7 cars.
The 1500 sheep will call for 6 cars;
in dressed form, 75,000 pounds, or 4
C3.rs
The 300 cattle will occupy 10 cars;
as dressed meat, 165,000 pounds, or
r S carB.

This traffic over the railroads en
tering Ogden will add to the import
I ance of this city as a shipping point.
', Work on the stockyards is to begin
before the end of this week. Concrete
floors are to cover the entiro area as
a sanitary measure and the very lat
1 est improvements will be made part
of the enclosures. When completed,

COLONEL HOUSE
VISITS WILSON
Reports to President Results
of Visit io Europe Praises
American Diplomats "
Aboard.
Washington, March 6. Colonel
E. M. House, who returned yesterday
from Europe, is understood to have
told President Wilson that he found
no more prospects for peace during
his recent visit to the capitals of
befllgerent nations than he did on his
"visit last spring.
Colonel House is understood to
have told the president there is con
stant danger in the negotiations with
Germany because of feeling there over
the submarine issue. Varying opin
ions over tho use of submarines exist
He told the president that the faction
favoring using submarines to the limit,
regardless of protests of neutrals is
a strong one and cannot be disregard
ed. Generally speaking, however, he
found no sympathy in favor of war
with the United States.
Washington, March 6. Colonel B.
M. House, who returned yesterday
after visiting Berlin, London and Par
is as a special envoy of President Wil
son, conferred with the president this
morning and told him of the results
of his mission. He plans to remain
here until tomorrow and then return
to New York.
Colonel Houso today parried ques
tions as to the status of the armed
ship controversy with the statement
that those in Washington know more
about the subject than he did. He
absolutely refused to discuss any pend
ing diplomatic questions or to com
ment on tho foreign situation.
When Colonel House left for Europe
reports were persistent that he went
abroad to investigate the peace situ
ation but that was emphatically de
nied by both president Wilson and
Secretary' Lansing.
It was understood today that Col
onel House expressed great admira
tion for the way American diplomats
abroad were carrying on their work.
He told the president in detail about
the state of public sentiment in Ger
many, France, and England and is
understood to have had much to say
on the Reeling in Germany In support
of the submarine policy.

ZEPPELINS KILL
TWELVE I RAID
Airships Drop Bombs in Eng
land and Destroy Houses
and Kill and Injure Wom
en and Children.
Berlin, March 6. By wireless to
Sayvllle. The German admiralty an
nounces today that during last night's
air raid over Eng'land tho naval depot
at Hull was bombarded, the explosions
being observed to be effective. All
the airships returned despite violent
shelling.
London, March 6, 1:45 p. m.
Twelve persons wore killed and 33 in
jured in last night's Zeppelin raid.
Three Zeppelins took part In tho at
tack. This Information was given out
officially today.
Tho statement follows:
"The number of Zeppelins which
took part in last night's raid is now
believed to have been throe.
"After crossing the coast, the air
ships took various caurses, and from
the devious nature of their flight, ap
parently wore uncertain as to their
bearings. Tho area visited Included,
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland,
Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk,
Essex and Kent.
"As far as is known about forty
bombs were dropped altogether. The
casualties, so far ascertained amount
to:
"Killed 3 men, 4 women, 5 children;
injured 33.
"The material damage was: Two
terrace houses practically destroyed,
one office, one public house, a cafo,
and several shops partially destroyed
and a block of almshouses badly dam
' aged."
An official statement issued in Lon
I don last night said two hostile alr
jghips had crossed over the. northeast
cornerof England. At that time their
movements had not been defined
clearly.
The number of casualties reported
Is much smaller than that of the pre
vious Zeppelin raid in which 67 per
sons were killed and 117 injured.
The censor permits publication of a
few incidents In connection with the
Zeppelin raid. In one of the principal
areas viBited, a block of workmen's
dwellings was demolished1. A woman
and her four children, all under nine
years, were killed. The woman's huB
band was taken to a hospital In a ser
ious condition.
Aged Pensioner Killed.
In another locality a doctor's house
was destroyed but the doctor and his
family had left the building. In an
other case a pensioner ninety years
of age was burned to death in his
bed.
The bombs dropped by the aircraft
were some of them incendiary and
some explosive.
Unofficial reports state that two of
the dirigibles were seen passing over
Lincolnshire from inland towards the
coast. They dropped bombs, but It
is, believed they did little damage.
It is also reported that bombs were
dropped In tho east of Yorkshire, the
only damage being the breaking of
windows. In view of the large areas
Isited, it is thought there may have
been more than three Zeppelins.
Raiders Have Narrow Escape.
The raiders had a narrow escape
from being caught in a snowstorm In
a northern county.
Many trains from the north of Eng
land were late In reaching London,
having, remained stationary while the
raid was in progress.
In some counties official warning
of tho approach of the Zeppelins was
given and the usual precautions were
taken. A correspondent on the east
coast says the approach of the dirigi
bles from the northeast was heralded
from ships and that immediately aft
erward the sky was lighted by incen
diary bombs

Olney Arnold, American Consul-General
at Cairo, on
Leave of Absence, An
swers Last Call.
Washington, March 6. Olney Ar
nold, American diplomatic agent and
consul-general at Cairo, Egypt, died
yesterday In n hospital at Lisbon,
Portugal. Advices to the state depart
ment from tho American consul there
told of his death, but did not state
tho cause.
Mr. Arnold was granted leavo of
abponce recently b5r the stato depart

ed States. His home was In Province,
R, I. He had been In the government
service since September 1913. He was

HOUSE DECIDES
ON SPECIAL ROLE
Debate on Armed Ship Resolu
tion Limited to Four Hours
Leaders Expect to Kill
McLemore Proposal.
Washington, March 6. The house
rules committee today decided upon
and will bring Into the house tomor
row a special rule for four hours' de
bate on the McLemore resolution
warning Americans off armed ships of
tho European belligerents. This ac
tion puts tho much discussed resolu
tion into a parliamentary position
where administration leaders are con
fident they can kill it.
WhPn Representative Gardner de
clared In the house today that there
should bo a clear vote on the subject,
Republican Leader Mann announced
he was against bringing the matter up
in the public at alL
"I have believed," said Mr. Mann,
"In letting the house attend to its
constitutional duties and letting the
president attend to his constitutional
duties."
Mann Takes Floor.
Tho houso resounded with cheers
when Mr, Mann fook the floor and as
Balled Americans who might involve
the country In war by traveling on
armed ships.
"I hope our citizens never will be
put to tho test of having to fight be
cause somo fool has Involved us by
entering upon a Joy ride," he shouted.
"The gentleman from Massachu
setts, Mr. Gardner," said Republican
Leader Mann, "haB charged that the
membership of the house In this mat
ter has been actuated, first by parti
san reasons, and second by fear of the
votes at home. The gentleman from
Massachusetts Is entitled to his opin
ion for himself but not for anyone else
on either side of the house. This Is
too grave a question for the patriotic
men of this house to be actuated by
baso motives as suggested by tho
gentlemen from Massachusetts."
The four hours debate on the Mc
Lemore resolution itself will be even
ly divided between the administration
forces and those opposed to it and
will be preceded by an hour and a
half of debate on the adoption of the
special rule -. -
Preliminary Victory For
Administration.
The rules committee's action today
is a preliminary victory for the ad
ministration forces.
Republicans on the rules committee
voted solidly against the special rulo
while the Democrats unanimously sup
ported It.
The special rule will provide that,
after tho four hours' debate, the Mc
Lemore resolution will bo before the
house for action. The program is to
table, as was done with the Gore reso
lution in the 'senate.
Washington, March 6. President
Wilson appealed directly to Represen
tative Bennett and Representative
Lenroot, Republican members of the
house rules' committee today, to con
sider tho armed ship issue without
partisan bias and assist in getting a
vote on a resolution warning Ameri
cans off armed ships. For an hour ho
discussed the foreign situation with
tlie two Republican juembors of the
committee and told of the necessity
of demonstrating that reports abroad
that the majority of congress was not
with him aro erroneous.
After the conference Mr.' Lenroot
said the Republicans had. no Inten
tion of bringing party considerations
into the issue. Both he and Mr. Ben
net rofused to discuss the details of
the conference They left the White
House to attend a mooting of the
rules' committee.

FRENCH FORCES
Repulses of Germans Contin
ue Enemy May Be Easily
Disposed of Than
first Expected.
FRENCH STAND FIRM
Best Troops of Enemy, Hurled
Forward Without Regard to
Cost, Finally Fall Back.
Paris, March 6, 5.45 a. m. Yester
day was a good day for the French
at Verdun, according to information
received this morning und abllc con
fidence Is greatly strengthened by the
news of tho continued ropulseB of the
Gorman attacks. In military and po
litical circles llvelysatlsfactlon Is ox
pressed regarding the situation and
the opinion now begins to prevail that
the great efforts of the Germans will
be more easily disposed of than was
at first expected.
Having failed to make any impres
sion on the Douaumont position and
on Vaux, to its right, the Gorman
general staff determined to smash the
French left on the Vachcrauville
wood Cote-du-PoIvro position. With
out regard to cost, the beat troops
were hurled forward but with no
more success than elsewhere. Pomer
anians and what was left of the Bran
donburgers dashed themselves vain
ly against the French, who stood as
immovable as a rock wall.
As at. Vaux, tho qormanaXlnallieUi
back, leaving heaps of dead on the
ground. The Frnech infantry, sup
ported by their formidable artillery
which will never, henceforth, lack am
munition, showed themselves able to
resist every onslaught. On the left
bank of the Meuso, artillery on both
sides thundered all day, long. Tho
French infantry in that section had
little to do, but it remains there readv
for any eventuality, although tho mil
tary exports believe it Is extremely
douotful that the Germans will at
tempt to storm the Mort Homme key
position for to do so they must de
ploy over a plain a mile wide under
cross fire from tho heights around.
French Holding Outskirts.
It is chiefly the French artillery
which is Involved in the Wroevro fight
ing. The French hold the outskirts of
the village of Manheulles firmly and
have stopped all attempts of the Ger
mans to debouch In that direction.
An idea of tho relatively small per
centage of French casualties in tho
Verdun battle is considered as de
ductible from a statement made by
a lieutenant who has arrived here
wounded. "Our losses," he said, "are
comparatively slight. My regiment,
for instance, has only forty-seven kill
ed and thirty-five wounded. This is
small for a unit which has been act
ing as support and which was en
gaged in the most violent ql the fight
ing. French Inflicting Heavy Losses.
London. March 6, 11:40 a. m. The
Central News correspondent at The
Hague says dispatches received there
from the front show that the Germans
are making vigorous efforts to cap
ture Fort Tavannes, four in lies north
east of Verdun, but that tho French
are resisting them resolutely, inflict
inp heavy losses on tho atacks.
Stubborn fighting continues near
Verdun, the correspondent says. The
village of Vaux no longer exists.
More than 10,000 Germans carried out
an assault upon the French positions
at Vaux but, tho correspondent says,
wore repulsed with heavy losses, sev
eral German lines being swept away
bv the famous French 75's.
It is also said that twenty-seven
trainloads of German wounded have
left the Verdun battlefields for Ger
many. oo

Review of War Situation.
The slashing attacks of the Gorman
Infantry In the Verdun region evident
ly have been suspended for tho time
being as neither of tho official state
ments of today mentions any activity
by the infantry arm, and the Berlin
statement notes a slackening in the
struggle. The deadlock in the Douau
mont region continues.
Today's official French bulletin
mentions tho bombardment by the
French of German positions in the
Argonno. The Germans continue
heavy bombardment of French posi
tions in the Woevre region.
Today's Berlin statement says near
ly one thousand French wore taken
prisoners Saturday and Sunday.
With the French center in the Dou
aumont sector apparently still hold
ing firmly togothor, tho Germans aro
again turning their attention to the
flankB of the French position around
the stronghold.
Inteuse artillery activity In the Woe
vre region was reported in the Paris
night bulletin, thcifire centering upon
the regions ot Haudomont and Fres
not, about ten miles southeast of Vei
dun. On the extreme French left,
across tho Meuse river, the heavy ar
tillery of the Teutons Is pounding tho
French defenses In Lo Mort Homme
region.
Meanwhilo the testing ofthe French,
strength by rurious assaults on the 'H
main defenses Is continuing. H
Correspondents who have been at i '
tho front, quote French military men H
as declaring that tho German achieve- ( I H
ments so far in the great battle for 'M
Verdun have resulted mere in restor- H
ing the lines to the positions they ocr H
cupied at the beginning of 1914, be-
fore the French, in a series of "local H
attacks began expanding the defensive H
area about tho fortress. H
Indications that the Germans may. H
bo planning another offensive jnbve- H
ment on the western front are contain- H
ed in reports from Dutch sources that
forty thousand German cavalrymen . '
are on their way to the battle, line H
near Ypres. H
In Armenia the Russians report con- H
tinulng their -pursuit of tho defeated H
Turks. Russian torpedo boats have ' H
bombarded Trebizond. H
The British otficlal report on the , H
last night's air raid over England i H
says twelve persons were killed and J H
33 injured. Three Zeppelins are be- H
lieved to have taken part in the at- j H
tack, which was over an area includ- H
ing eight counties. " I H
