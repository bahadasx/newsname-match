AND CHURCH AND CONVENT
PROPERTY CONFISCATED BY
CARRANZA GOVERNMENT
VALUED AT 250,CC0.
New York, March 5. A party of
thirty nuns, members of the Order of
Salesians, who said their church and
convent property at Morales, Mexico,
valued at $2",0.000, had been conns-1
cated by the Carranza government,
arrived here Sunday on the steam
ship Antonio Lopez from Mexican
ports.
The members of the party, in
charge of the mother superior, Fran
ceaca Chaon y Antequera, are on their
way to Spain. They said they had
been forbidden to work, longer in
Mexico.
"Our convent, where for more than
twelve years we had been educating
children of the peons, was closed ear
ly in December," one of the nuns
said. "We were accused of being- in
sympathy with General Carran.a's
enemies and we were evidently con
victed. At any rate, we were told
to leave, being allowed to take with
us only our personal property.
"Friends of our order in Vera Cm;:
and other Mexican cities gave us
she -lit r until the ship sailed. We
were not subjected to any indignities,
but it is hard t: leave our work and
the hundreds of children whom we
have learned to love. Friends in
Spain have paid our passage from
M"xio to Madrid. '
Reports of an epidemic of typhus,
in Mexico were confirmed by mem
hi rs of the party and by other pas
sengers. It was said, however, that
a sys'emntu: cleaning up of the towns
and widespread sanitation work, main
ly under the direction of American
doctors, was rapidly stamping out the
disease and that the epidemic would
be under control inside of two months.

SANK FIFTEEN SHIPS
Feat Sa d to be one of the Greatest of
the War and Government is Being
Urged to Send Out Other Ships on
Similar Missions.
Amsterdam, March 6. The Berlin
newspapers declare that the adven
tures of the commerce raider Moewe
which successfully came back to Ger
many yesterday, after sinking fifteen
ships, taking 1J9 prisoners and one
million marks in gold bars, was one of
the greatest events of the war.
The newspapers today urge the
government to permit other ships to
go on similar missions.
Awarded Iron Cross
London, March t). An Exchange dis
patch from Amsterdam says the
Moewe reached Wilhelmshaven Satur
day. Count von Dohna, the Moewe's com
mander, has been awarded the Iron
Cross of the first class and the mem
bers of the crew have received the I
iron cross of the second class. Count
von Dohna has been ordered to meet
Emperor William at headquarters.
The Moewe's capture of two of the
15 vessels listed by the German ad
miralty has not been reported pre
viously. They are the Saxon Prince
and the Martini both of which were
engaged in the trans-Atlantic service.
The Saxon I'rince, owned by the
Prince line of Newcastle, England,
was last reported on sailing from Nor
folk, February 2. for Manchester.
The Martini sailed 0:1 February 15
from Bordeaux for New York. She was
owned by the Compagnie Generale
Trans-Atlantique, of Havre.
The Moeve, previously made famous
by her exploits, has performed one
of the most spectacular feats of the
war on the seas by reaching a home
port. The great German naval port
of Wilhelmshaven Is on the North
s. a. which is patrolled with ceaseless
vigilance by British warships.
At least part of the gold captured by
the Moewe was taken from the Appam,
which put in at Newport News several
weeks ago under command of Lb-uteii- j
