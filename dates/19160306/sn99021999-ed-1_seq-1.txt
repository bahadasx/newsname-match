POLITICAL GOSSIP
AT STATE CAPITAL
Governor Morehead Has Promises of
. Both Sides to Support Zim for
Senator Next TJme. -
STRING TO DEAL WITH SUTTON
Political pilgrims returning from
tbe breeding place of candidates at
Lincoln bring back with them some
spicy gossip In circulation among the
knowing ones down there. '
"The projection of Governor
Morehead as a candidate for vice
president on the democratic ticket,"
said one of these back-from-t he
capital voyagers, "la merely Intended
to give him a little advertising and
fcep him in the public eye, for he
has definitely stated he is not to be
a candidate for any office this year.
There Is no secret about It,hongb,
that the governor is Incubating &
senatorial bee which he Is holding
In storage for two years hence, 'if
he can maintain his political grip
that long. ,
"The governor has been occupying a
peculiarly strategic position, being- as
siduously courted by both democratic
faction.
Wist nlaa tm Baa Acala.
"Senator Hltchcok and . bis bunch tried
their best to persuade hint to stand for a
third term as governor, and the Bryan
crowd at the sama time exerted all their
blandishments to Induce him to try for
senator . against Hitchcock. Senator
nitchoock Is commonly supposed to have
promised In advance to support More
head for senator next time, with the full
steam of his newspaper thrown In, In
consideration of his keeping- out this
time, and Governor Morehead Is credited
with havinr played h cards so shrewdly
on the pther side of the fence also that
he has a letter, written and signed by
W. J. Bryan, telling- him what a fine
senator he would mako and how glad the
Bryana would be to ivo him the prestige
of their, favor, which .letter has been
carefuly filed away for use whenever It
can be properly capitalised.
' draft aa, I'akaowa.
"The drafting of a completely unknown
like Keith NevlUa as the gubernatorial
candidate of the Hitchcock democrats Is
taken to reflect the desperate straits they
are- in. Having- vainly done their level
best first to set Morehead on the track
and then to draw out ex-fienator William
V. Allen, they were 'p In the air with
one or two other names in renerve, but
none satisfactory, and when at tbe con
ference of the senator with his demo
cratic ' lieutenants -someone .proposed
young Neville, he was'sclsed on as a life
saver and' orders at once Issued for the
llvjiest publicity campaign to Introduce
him to the public and to extell his .vir
tues ever pulled off before- a primary,
and this campaign Is now In progress.
"Another piece of gossip comes as an
aftermath of the deal which eliminated
Pollard from the republican competition
In favor of Sutton. Aa put up to Pollard,
the proposition provided for submission
of the question as to which should with
draw to a committee of mutual friends,
and Pollard accepted the finding like a
good loser and Issued his statement ask
ing bis friends to fall In Una for Sutton.
It has since leaked out. so the story
goes, that Sutton's acquiescence had a
string to It, and that the condition of
his consent was this: . That should the
decision favor Polls rd and Pollard be
elected governor, he should appoint gut
ton to the first vacant place within bis
gift, -either as I'nited States senator or
aa member of the state supreme court.
But What Sutton was to do for Pollard
In the reverse situation seems to have
been overlooked." ,

hide the ugly fact that our people are

our rights In taking thia business,, but it
leaves us In a weak position to invoke the

shall have to fight unless our defense Is

The conference at ita final bualneas ses

ADVANTAGE OF SURPRISE LOST
PARIS, March 5. It is stated
seml-offirially , that the battle . at
Verdun centlnued yesterday through
out the day with the same intensity
and without causing an change In
the respective positions of the op
posing .armies. Fighting Is still
going on for definite possession of
the village of Douaumont. -
The situation, as a. result. of tble
second phase o tthe German of
fensive la' regarded - as altogether
different from that of, the first day
battle.t , The only progress made by
the German , was during tue first
two' days of the second attack. For
the last forty-eight hours they have
not advanced..
The comparison also is In favor of the
French by reason of -the fact -that the
Germans now have lost the advantage of
surprise and also because the ground baa
been, torn up to such an extent that It
cannot be organised properly. .
Great Bfamaera el Dead,. .
This Information from semi-official
source points out that it must be de
moralising to the Germans to see soma
40,000 to 60,000 corpses of their comrades
lying before the French Unea.
Reinforcements brought up by the Ger
mans since the Inauguration of the see-1
ond phase of the battle on Wednesday
are estimated here at 250,000 men. raising
the total forces utilised by the' assailants
to more than 600,000. Estimate of losses
show wide variance; Details of local ac
tions and the glse of the reserves brought
up cause French observers to make the
assertion that the Germans have paid a
very heavy price for the aix sqjare miles
of ground they have gained. ,
In front ef the village -of Vaux alone
4.000 Gei-map corpses were counted after
the eighth - unsuccessful attempt. This
part of the battle,' although overshadowed
by the fight for Pouaumont, Is regarded
In Paris as a serious check for (he at
tackers. t lloaa Over Fallea ( oairaa.
The Germans ' carried on the assault
with i great courage until the dead lay
thick on the field. Then the offloers. It
la said, were compelled to urge on the
troops as they clambered over the corpses
of their fallen comrades for the last as
saults, t
The attack on Vaux began on the eve
ning of March I. after a furious shelling,
and continued until tbe following night.
Columns of Germans advancing simul
taneously from the north and northwest
tried to envelope the village. French ar
tillery Immediately opened a heavy fire,
which separated the first wave of Ger
mans from their reinforcements. Never
theless, the fresh troops came on and
observers saw plainly the tragic spectacle
of Unea of men lunging into that storm
of ateel and emerging thinned to half
their strength. Some contingents lost six
out of every ten men before even having
fired a shot. ' .
Sis Hr.lmrila Advaace.
The survivors, unilwsittd resolutely
stormed the French trenches and fought
hand-to-hand In fierce melees at the out
skirts of the village. The bitterest fight
ing was for possession of the road lead
ing to Pouaumont, the advantage of
which was obvious. The Germans chsiged
eight times there. The Supreme effort

The determination of the German at

explained by the atrateglc advantage of

French barring th way to the- bastion
