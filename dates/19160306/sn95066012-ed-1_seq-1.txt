Famous German Raider Back Safe

HAS SUNK FIFTEEN SHIPS
German Raider Took 199 Captives
Home and Safely Eluded Whole
British Fleet.
BerJJn, March 5. Official announce
ment was made by the Naval General
Staff today that the German com
merce raider Mowe had returned to a
German port. She had on board 199
prisoners and 1,000,000 marks (about
f250,000) In gold bars. The state
rnent follows:
.the Mowe, previously made famous
by her exploits, has performed one of
the most spectacular feats of the war
on the seas by reaching a home port
in safety. The Great German naval
poit of Wilhelmshaven Is on the North
Sea, which is patroled with ceaseless
vigilance by British warships. It Is
through these waters, which have
been blocked off in districts for patrol
by the different British units, that the
Mowe must have threaded her way to
home and safety.
The Mowe has captured and de
stroyed 14 British and French ships in
addition to" the Appam which is at
Norfolk. .' The value of property de
stroyed by the raider is many millions
and the tonnage of ships destroyed is
over 60,000. '

DEFENDED PERRY BILL
Rev. Clifford H. Smith of. Burlington
, Spoke at Methodist Church.
Ilev.; Clifford H. Smith of Burlington,
secretary of the Vermont Anti-Saloon
league,' spoke to a union meeting of
the Methodist, Congregational and Bap
tist churches of the village, at the
Methodist church Sunday evening.
The church was filled to hear Mr.
Smith debate the positive side of the
Prohibition question and clear up
some doubtful points about the Perry
bill. 4
Mr. Smith was recovering . from a
severe cold aud it was necessary tor
him to conserve his voice, in spite of
which he delivered a highly entertain
ing as well as instructive address. His
remarks, were punctuated with illus
trations and the services were pro
traded to nearly double the usual
Sunday evening period, in spite of
which he held his audience.
Mr. 'Smith discussed tho ultimate ef
fect iof the Perry bill on Vermont In
general and Bennington in particular.
Theine of his argument was that the
Perry act was exactly tho same as
iqupr'is, sold under In Vermont at the
present time, but with the local option
claijae sfrjken out, and from this ar
gument he- proceeded to show by
figures the comparative cost of the
liquor traffic to Vermont and Benning
ton Jn cash under Prohibition and un
der local option.
Following his address, the meeting
was opened for questions aud discus
sion and several Bennington people
asked the speaker questions on points
on which they were not clear. Philip
T. H. Pierson, Merritt B. Morgan, W.
B. Sheldon and others took part in the
discussion.'

OBITUARY-
Short
Sketch . fit . the
Late , Barker
. i
j ,,; ... ;,r, Vail,.'; ; ,
. Barker F. Vail, who passed to his
rest on Wednesday. March 1st, was a
highly respected citizen and member
of one of the older families of Ben
nington. Mr. Vail s father, Ossamus
Merrill Vail, left Bennington when
quite a young man, for what was then
considered the far west. He settled
and married in Louisville. Kentucky,
and there Barker F., the youngest oi
seven children, was born March 20,
1852. '
When he was about four years of
age, tho family removed to Brooklyn,
where ho remained through his early
boyhood. When he entered his teeus,
he was sent to the Yates Seminary in
Old Bennington., While there he lost
both parents and henceforth remained
in Bennington, making his homo with
his uncle, the late John W. Vail. Up
hls uncle's death Mr. Vail ' inherited
tho Vail Homestead, which has now
been in possession of the family con:
siderably more than one hundred
years. ' ' ' ' 0
Mr. Vail was of a quiet, retiring dis
position, a good neighbor and friend,
a man of remarkable . energy and in
dustry, and had made his farm one of
tho best in town. He was exceedingly
loyal to his friends and they were al
ways sure of a hearty welcome to his
home, where they will greatly miss
him. He was a member and for many
years a Deacon of the church in Old
Bennington.
He had always enjoyed good health
until this past winter. His fatal ill
ness, which was of several weeks dur
ation, was very trying but he bore It
with undaunted courage and fortitude.
His wife pre-deceased him in 1910.
He leaves surviving him two sons,
John W., "of San Francisco, Calif., and
Lester B., of Clinton, Mass., and two
daughters, Mrs. S. Everett Harwood
and Miss Louise M., both of Bcnning
ton, and two grand children, Harriet
and Lester Harwcod. His funeral, at
'Vhlch the Rev. Isaac Jennings,
officiated, took place on Friday, March
3d", at 2:30. The interment was in
the Od Bennington cemetery. F. C. W,

Raymond Trainor Thinks Per.y Bill
Beaten By 5,000

U id Vote Expected all Over State
Primary Referendum Overshadowed
By Rum Issue.
The fight over prohibition comes, to !
a head tomorrow in the 24G towns of f
Vermont and indications are that. a ;.
largo vote will be cast. Regular town j
meeting affairs take a secondary place
in interest. , ,
Tho supporters of the Perry bill ex
pect to carry the state by a safe lead.
Some of them estimate from 1500 to
2000. .
Raymond Trainor, secretary of the
local option league, says the Perry bli
will be beaten by nearly 5000.
The leaders, on both sides, are still
hustling for votes which shows they
are not as sure as they claim.
The state vote 13 years ago was:
for prohibition, 28,982; for local op
tion, 29,711. This made the official
local option majority 729, but It was
actually about 300 more as one or two
towns fa Hod to send their returns in
season to be canvassed.
The vote of Bennington in 1903
was: for local option 1430; for prohi
bition, 1S8. This gave a local option
majority here of 1248., The vote of
Bennington county was 2670 for local
option and 1076 for prohibition.
There is also a referendum tomor:
row cn the primary, but It is largely
lost sight of owing to the liquor issue.
The men, v : ir" generally con
trolled the pu.iuL otv!2-vont, are
trying hard to defeat the primary
which gives the plain voters control of
nominations and : . party , machinery.
The voters should not forget to vote
"yes" on the green ballot
SPEAKS FROM' EXPERIENCE
50-Year Voter Says Drink Was Sold In
i-' i 40 Places in Town,
Editor The Banner: I
Away back in the good old prohibi
tion (?) days it was an absolute fact
that with the Bennington House ' at
North Bennington as a "starting
point" and the little white house close
to the Benton Bridge as a "final,"
there were nearly 40 places that sold
altholic drinks.
Mostly, these places had open
doors, but some kitchen were on the
sly. This is true, and while I write it
as an influence for local option, It re
mains a fact, just the same. I wonder
if voters would like to havea repeti
tion of these things?
Nevermore, nevermore, for me, 50
years a voter!
