AMERICA IS PREY
OF CRIMINAL BAND
Attune? Jloyne of (hicaeo Says a
Powerful Organization is in
Operation Here.
Chicago, March 6. A powerful or
ganization exists for the purpose of
assisting fugitive criminals, to whom
the war has closed the capitals of
Europe, to escape to Havana, accord
ing to the belief of State's Attorney
Hoyne.
Traces of the organization, it was
said, have been brought to light in
the search for a widely known crim
inal wanted here as a witness. It was
pointed out that the stringent regu
lations in Europe have rendered value
less the fraudulent passports former
ly employed by escaping criminals and
that Havana is within easy striking
distance of Talm Beach, a fashionable
American w inter resort.
It is asserted that the organization
has been perfected to a point where
criminals are warned of a pending
attempt to extradite them from Cuba
in time to escape to Honduras, where
there is no extradition to the United
States or to some of the nearby is
lands where they may hide in safety.

THE WAR
TODAY
With tho French center in the
Douaumont sector apparently still
holding firm against the desperate
assaults of the crown prince's
armies, the liermnns are again
turning their attention to the
Hanks of the French positions
around the stronghold.
Artillery activity in the Woevre
region was reported in the Paris
night bulletin, the tire centering
upon the regions of Handomont
and Fresnot. about ten miles
southeast of Verdun.
The heaTy artillery of the Ten
tons is pounding the defenses
across the Meuse riTer. The
French are ready for an infantry
attack there but it is doubted in
Paris if the Germans will attempt
the storming of the commanding
position, to reach which their
troops would hare to deploy oTer
a mile wide plain under a destruc
tive cross fire.
Testing of the French strength
by furious assaults on the main
defenses is continuing.. In yester.
day's attack on the left of the
Douaumont sector, near the Cote
Du Poivre, French lines also held
firm, according to Paris, while in
front of Douaumont German as
saults were temporarily suspend
ed, the heavy French artillery con
tinuing its answer to the rain of
giant sliells which the Teuton 42's
and similiar big pieces were pour
ing upon the defensive trenches.
Correspondents who have been
at the front quote French military
men as declaring that the German
achievements so far in the great
battle for Verdun have resulted
merely in restoring the lines to
the positions they occupied before
the French, in local attacks, began
expanding the defensive area
about the fortress.. Verdun itself
is now under German artillery fire
bnt, according to correspondents
little damage lias been done.
The fighting around Verdun is
still described as vigorous, but
within the last 24 hours it has con
sisted mostly of artillerx,. duels.
According to Paris official reports,
the French arc withstanding the
Germans and no gains have been
reported by either side, except in
Lorraine, near the forest of Thla
ville, w here the French forced the
Germans to evacuate certain posi
tions, in onler, according to Ber
line, "to avoid unnecessary losses."
In northwest Russia near III
sukest, the Russians and Germans
fought a furious battle for the pos
session of II mines exploded by
the Russians. Petrograd reports
that the Russians captured six of
the craters. Inflicting severe losses
upon the Germans.
The London Times today prints
an account of the situation on the
Verdnn front, written by Lord
'orthcliffe, publisher of the paper
in which he estimates the German
losses at 100,000 men. He believes
the struggle has not yet reached
the climax of intensity and says:
"Verdun is not likely to be taken.'

EX-MAYOROF
CLEVELAND
OFFERED JOB
Newton D. Baker Chosen to
Fill Vacancy in the
Wilson Cabinet.
IS DEFENSE ADVOCATE
He Is Said to Be Strongly in
Sympathy With Prepar
edness Plans.
Washington, March 6. Newton D. !
Baker, former mayor of Cleveland, has
been selected by President Wilson for
secretary of war. Mr. Baker formerly
was mayor of Cleveland. He was of
fered a place when the cabinet was
formed but declined. Mr. Baker has
accepted the position and is now ar
ranging his affairs in Cleveland prep
artory to coming to Washington to take
up his duties.
The president and Mr. Baker have
been close friends for some time. Mr.
Baker is said to be in close sympathy
with the president's policies and is
known to have had the support of some
members of the cabinet for the war of
fice. Mr. Baker is 44 years old. He was
born in Martinsburg, W. Va., and at
the age of 25 was appointed private
secretary to Postmaster General Wil
son in President Cleveland's cabinet.
In 1897 he began the practice of law at
Martinsburg, but not long thereafter
moved to Cleveland where he became
city solicitor in 1902. He held this of
fice for 10 years until his election as
mayor. In 1914 he was reelected
mayor for a two-year term.
For years Mr. Baker has beep, close
ly identified with the reform movement
in Cleveland. He brought an adjust
ment of the street railway franchises
in Cleveland.
Vice Presidency Expected.
At the time of the Baltimore conven
tion when President Wilson was nomi
nated, Mr. Baker was prominently
mentioned for the vice presidency be
cause of the fight he made in support
of Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Baker has been known for years
as a leader of the Ohio bar and is high
ly regarded by the president as a law-
yer.
I Mr. Baker was known as the original
! man in Ohio. At the time of the Balti
more convention in 1912 Judson Har
mon, former governor of Ohio was
candidate for the presidential nomina
tion and controlled a majority of the
Ohio delegation, but Mr. Baker was for
Wilson and swung with him a number
of northern Ohio delegates. The suc
cessful fight, which he personally led
on the floor of the convention to pre
vent the adoption of the unit rule
saved these Ohio votes to Wilson.
Prominent Democrat.
Mr. Baker is a member of the Ohio
state democratic committee and chair
man of the executive committee of his
county committee. He has the record
of having run for public office in Cleve
land during 14 consecutive years with
out defeat. He declined to run for of
fice again in order to devote his time
to private law practice.
Grateful to President.
Cleveland, March 6. "I have noth
ing to say except that I feel compli
mented by the president's confidence.
I am deeply grateful and certainly ap
preciate what he has done."
These were the words of Newton
Diehl Baker, former mayor, today
when asked for a statement regarding
his appointment by President Wilson
to secretary of war. Mr. Baker con
i firmed his acceptance and then con
tinued arguing a law suit in common
pleas court, in which he was engaged
when the word came to him that his
appointment had been announced.

and will bring into the house tomor

CAPITAL CAR
TRAFFIC TIED
UP IN STRIKE
People of Washington Are
Forced to Walk or Seek
Other Conveyances.
Washington, March 6. The capital
of the United States realized fully to
day that it had a street car strike.
When the companies began running
cars this morning with the few men
who stuck to their posts, recruit crews
of inspectors, clerks, machinists and
former employes, they gave service
about 25 per cent of normal.
The result was that the few cars
operating between 8 and 9 a. m. were
overloaded and thousands of people
walked.
So far the strike has proceeded with
out violence. Leaders have urged the
men to be peaceable and to remain
away from saloons. Conferences be
tween strike leaders, railway company
heads, the board of commissioners
which governs the District of Colum
bia, and representatives of the depart
ment of labor, in progress here all
night, continued today.
Better Hours Demanded.
The men demand a minimum wage
of 30 cents an hour and 10 hours' work
within 12 consecutive hours. One com
pany now pays 22 cents an hour and
the other pays 25. The men contend
that some of them are obliged, by in
terrupted runs, to be practically on
duty 16 to 18 hours to get in a day's
work.
The railway company heads main
tain that the strike was called prac
tically without warning early Sun
day. One of the companies has two mass
meetings arranged, at which the offi
cials will explain the company's po
sition to the strikers.
Trucks Come to Aid.
Many public service corporations,
such as the telephone company, and
the lighting company, got out their
I own trucks to distribute their em
, ployes. Large motor trucks are used
regularly by the postoffice department
here to collect mails and distribute
i carriers to their routes, and there was

CAPTURES OF
MEN TOLD BY
TEUT REPORT
Nearly 1,000 French Taken
by Germans in Sunday
Battle, Claim.
BOMBARDING FORTS
Heavy Artillery Fire Con
tinuesParis Hears of
Little Action.
Berlin, March 6 (via London 8:20
p. m.) Capture of nearly 1,000 French '
near Verdun on Saturday and Sunday
was announced today by the war of
fice. The prisoners captured east of
the Meuse number 14 officers and 934
men.
The statement follows:
"Western front: Lively mining
duels occurred northeast of Vermel
les. British Infantry which delivered
minor attacks on several occasions in
this neighborhood was repulsed by
our fire.
"On the eastern bank of the Meuse
the day passed more quietly than
previous days. Nevertheless we cap
tured yesterday and the day before,
during minor engagements, 14 officers
and 934 men.
"Eastern and Balkan front: There
Is nothing to report"
Paris, March 6 (2:30 p. m.) There
was no infantry to the north of Verdun
last night, the war office announced
today. The statement follows:
"In the Argonne we have bombard
ed different sections of the forest of
Cheppy and the Malancourt-Avocourt
road.
"In the region north of Verdun the
night passed without infantry action.
The artillery action continued violent
ly on the left bank of the Meuse and
intermittently west of Douaumont and
in the Woevre.
"Our batteries have actively bom
barded the enemy. The night was
calm on the rest of the front."
A semi-official statement Bays there
were no infantry actions last night
north of Verdun but that violent artil
lery engagements continue along the
left bank of the Meuse and intermit
tently elsewhere. Calm prevails on
the remainder of the front.
Good Day for French.
Yesterday was a good day for the
French at Verdun, according to infor
mation received this morning and pub
lic confidence is greatly strengthened
by the news of the continued repulses
of the German attacks. In military
and political circles lively satisfaction
is expressed regarding the situation
and the report now begins to prevail
that the great effort of the Germans
will be more easily disposed of than
was at first expected. Having failed
to make any impression on the Douau
mont position and on Vaux to its right,
the German general staff determined
to smash the French left on the Vach
erauville wood Cote Du Poivre posi
tion. Without regard to cost the best
troops were hurled forward but witJi
no more success than elsewhere. Pom
eranians and what was left of the
Brandenburgers dashed themselves
vainly against the French, who stood
as immovable as a rock wall.
Violent Fighting at Vanx.
At Vaux the Germans finally fell
back, leaving heaps of dead on the
ground. The French infantry, support
ed by their formidable artillery, which
will never henceforth lack ammuni
tion, showed themselves able to resist
every onslaught. On the left bank of
the Meuse artillery on both sides thun
dered all day. The French infantry
! in that section has little to do, but it
remains there ready for any emer
! gency, although the military experts
believe it doubtful that the Germans
will attempt to storm the Mort Hommo
; key position, for to do so they must
j deploy over a plain a mile wide under
j cross fire from the heights around.
I Halt Itcrman Action.
It is chiefly the French artillery
which is involved in the Woevre figi.
! ing. The French hold the outskirts of
; the village of Manheulles firmly and
' have stopped all attempts of the Ger
j mans to debouch In that direction.
An idea of the relatively small per-
centage of French casualties In the
; Verdun battle is considered as deduc
' ible from a statement made by a lteu
j tenant who has arrived here wounded.
j "Our losses," he said, "are compara
I tively slight. My regiment for in
j stance had only 47 killed and S3
; wounded. This is small tor a unit
! which has been acting as support and
! which was engaged la the most viy
ik'ut of the sh.Uil.',
