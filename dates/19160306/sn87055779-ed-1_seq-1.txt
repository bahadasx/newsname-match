Lips Sealed.
WASIIINOTON, March 6. Prea't
AVilson plans to make the position of
the United States on tiefenaive arma
ment for merchant ships, plain to all
of the belligerents. Such action,
however, will not be taken until af
ter compress has disposed of the pro
posed lejfinlatlon warning American
citizens not ty ride on armed mer
chantmen. It is hoped by the ad
ministration that congress will final
ly dispose of this question within
the n o few day.
The appendices to the German an
nouncement of the new submarine
war are now in the hands of Sec'y
Lansin?. They arrived on the steam
er Rotterdam yesterday. In addi
tion the secretary ha received by
cable from Ambassador Page in
London, the official copy of the Hrlt
ish admiralty announcement showing
Just what instructions British mer-
hant captains are now working1
under. It is expected that 'as soon
:ih he has had opportunity carefully
to examine these documents, the sec
retary will notify Count von Bern
xtorff exactly what constitutes de
fensive armament.
To Confer with Hoilm.
.Meanwhile Pres t Wilson will con
fer at length this week with Col.
II. M. House, who returned yesterday
from his trip to Kngtand, France
and Germany. It was. stated that
the colonel will be a house Kuest of
the preMden at the white hode for
two or three days and will present a
complete report of his observations
abroad. The colonel Is known to
have, sounded out the dlplomaMo
heads of tho belliKerent nations on
the questions that are so vital to the
Cnlted States, a well as to havo
.ought their views on whether It
would be possible to initiate a pace
movement at this time. It wan
stated at the white house that it was
unlikely that any announcement
would be made concerning- the
colonel's trip.
Col. House came to Washington
on the midnight train and was met
at the station by one of tho white
house automobiles. He refused to
ay anything whatever about his
Kuropean trip.
"My lips are sealed," he said. "If
finythin? is to be said the president
must say It."
The president returned this morning-
from a trip down the Potomac
on the Mayflower. He and Col.
Jfouse had breaktast together. After
the meal the president conferred
with Heps. Lenroot and Bennet, re
publican members of the rules com
mittee. The president explained to
lhem his desire for speedy action by
congress.
Both Bennet and Lenroot gavt
out the impression when they left
the white house that they had
pledged their support to Pres't Wil
son. Rep. Inroot stated that they
assured the president that they did
not intend to make a partisan mat
ter of the international situation.
Still Sock AKTevment.
Houe leaders today were still en
deavoring to reach an agreement as
to what action that body will take
n the McLemore resolution. The
leaders, headed by Hep. Kltchin.
would like a vote on the merits of
the proposition. Chairman Flood of
the foreign affairs committee, how
ever, today declared that he will op
pose this.
"Our committee has recommended
that the Mclmore resolution be
tabled and has asked that the rule;?
ommlttee report a resolution that
will permit this." he said. "We will
insist that this he done."
Reports that William Jennlns
Bryan intended to t.nke a hand in the
riirht against the president were de
nied on h!s behalf today by Rep.
Stephens of NeVraskn. The latter
stated that while Rryan believes
that congress should warn Americans
not to travel on armed ships h? will
not try to influence congress one way
or the other at the present time.

tion had gained material strength
over Sunday and they will endeavor

SEE ERB TESTS
Aviators Will Test Advisabil
ity of Endorsing Lincoln
.Highway Route,
South Bend will In all probability
be one of.the stations . alonJho
routc'of the Lincoln highway which
will b4? used by aviators of the Aero
club of Ai lerica which Is to stage
a series of teats this summer along
the highway. The purpose of the
tests is to determine whether or not
the highway should be endorsed by
the Aero club as the otliclal coast
to coast "air line" route.
The Information was brought to
South Bend Monday by H. C. Oster
mnnn, held secretary of the Lincoln
highway. He was in the city inter
esting the local association in the
tests.
In order to make South Bend one
of the stations along the route, Mr.
Ostennann pointed out that it would
be necessary that adequate prepara
tions for a landing place for the
aviators be made. A large maltese
cross painted white would be laid
out in the center of the landing
placo to indicate Its location to the
aviators flying above. A huge search
light with various colored streams
would be u:?ed at night to direct the
flyers to the landing place.
Assurances that these features
would be provided for In outh Bend
was made Monday by Abe Frank.
He stated that the fair association
had capable facilities for the sta
tion, and that the entire matter
would be taken care of by that or
ganization. FlisM to Tako Four Days.
These flights will take place dur
ing the summer and continue from
day to day. The Usts will be thor
ough to demonstrate the advisabil
ity of selecting the otttclal rcute,
and will be made in relays. The flight
from coast to coast is expected ti
consume four days In all.
The proposition of carrying mall
by the "air route", Mr. Ostermann
Bald, was also under consideration,
and had been taken up with the
government postal authorities ,at
Washington. Sulflcient assurance
from them that a trial tesr of this
method of dispatching mail would
be made, had been given to the ottt
cials of the aero club, t'ae held sec
retary pointed out.
Another plan being broached by
the Lincoln highway Is to make a
test on June 3 5 of the road from a
military standpoint. It is planned to
have F.. C. Patterson of Colliers,
Julian Street and a representative
of the Saturday evening Post, to
gether with an army engineer to
make the trip. The probable adop
tion of the highway as a ml itary
route from coast to coast wouM then
!e succinctly brought before ths at
tention of congress, Mr. Often lann
Indicated.
It is planned to make this test a
record run, and the automobile
tearing the government olticialsand
magazine representatives will pro
ceed loth day and night. It Is
hoped to better the time made by
the railroads.
Mr. 0ttrmann s.ilj that the high
way was being shortened and that
curcs and detours, especially in the
wes-t, are being eliminated. He said
that the route was now only 20 miles
longer than the transcontinental
railway lines and 11 C mile shorter
than the transcontinental Ultihonc
und telegraph route.

TD SCHOOL BOAR
Local Attorney Accepts Posi
tion Made Vacant by Hub
bard's Resignation.
CTTa"rles P. "Dnimmond has been
appointed to fill the unexpired term
of A, L. Hubbard, who resigned from
the school board several days ago as
the result of the Montgomery mud
dle, according to the announcement
made Monday morning by Mayor F.
W. Keller. Mr. Drummond, upon
inquiry, stated that he had accepted
the appointment and "qualified" for
the place.
The new memher of the school
board will attend his first meeting
Tuesday night with E. li. Kupel and
William Clem, the two administra
tion appointees who were responsible
for the dismissal and subsequent
resignation of L. J. Montgomery, su
perintendent of schools. Mr. Drum
mond is an attorney with offices in
the Jefferson building and has prac
ticed law here for several years. He
was recently president of the bar
association and has held several
other offices.
Hubbard's resignation came at the
height of the school controversy.
Rupel and Clem ruled the board and
voted to remove Supt. Montgomery
at the close of the present year.
Veiled charges were made against
the superintendent but not sub
stantiated and no definite reason for
his dismissal was given. Mr. Hub
bard first stated that he would re
sign from the board if Messrs. Rupel
and Clem would do the same. They
refused to budge' from the position
they had taken although public sen
t'.ment was against their action.
Hubbard resigned anyway, feeling
that he could not work In harmony
under the existing conditions.
Fntll Monday Mayor Keller had
given no intimation as to who the
new board member would be, even
stating early Monday morning that
he was unprepared to say whether
the appointment would be made be
fore the Tuesday night meeting. At
11 o'clock he gave out the announce
ment that Mr. Drummond had been
chosen for Mr. Hubbard's place.

International News Per loo:
LONDON, March 6. Twelve per
sons were killed and 33 injured in
the zeppelin raid over the northeast
coast of England last night, it was
otnV!ally announced this afternoon.
Three zeppelins took part in the
raid instead of two, a-s was origin
ally reported. Forty bombs were
dropped by the aerial raiders.
The following statement was given
out by the admiralty:
"The number of zeppelins taking
part in the raid is believed to have
been three. After crossing the coast
the airships took various courses and
from the devious nature of their
flight the pilots were apparently un
certain as to their bearings. The
area visited included Yorkshire, Lin
colnshire, Rutland, Huntingdon,
Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Essex and
Kent. About 4 0 bombs were drop
ped. Five Children Killed.
"Altogether the casualties so far
ascertained amount to three men.
four women and ttve children killed
and 33 persons wounded. The ma
terial damage is two terraces and
houses destroyed, one office, one
public house and several shops part
ly destroyed. An alms house was
also damaged." v
The" "eigTiF'counties Include nearly
the whole area of the northeast, east
and southeast coast. Yorkshire, Lin
colnshire, Norfolk, Essex and Kent
are on the North sea. Cambridge
shire, Rutland and Huntingdon are
inland.
From the mouth of the Thames
(the northern border of Kentshire)
to Yorkshire is approximately 160
miles. It Is 130 miles from London
to Yorkshire. The zeppelins pene
trated from 75 to S5 miles" inland
from the coast
The German admiralty Is feeling
with zeppelins in an effort to locate
th-e British, grand fleet. This is the
belief which exists in England today
as a result of the queer behavior of
the zeppelins which took part in
Sunday's raid over the northeast
coast. The German balloons pene
trated far to the north and followed
a z g-zag course which, at times,
took them far out over the sea.
It is believed to be the hope of
the German admiralty of locating
the grand fleet and then attacking
the dreadnaughts with bombs.
The whereabouts of the high seas
fleet has been a mystery since the
the early days of the war. It is
known that the coasts are guarded
by speedy cruiser and scouts and
destroyers, but the great super
dreadnaughts and battle cruisers of
the home fleet have been kept hid
den. It is possible that they may be
in well protected harbors on the west
coast, but many think that they are
In northern waters. This suspicion
receives some suptrt from the fact
that many merchant ships which
have been seized were taken into
port at Kirkwall, Scotland.
The raid on Sunday was the 30th
made over English territory- by the
Germans since the attack on Dec.
24, 1914. Two hundred and 3 4 per
sons, many of them women and chil
dren, have been killed during the
raid.
B2RLIN. March 6. (Via Amster
dam) Count von Dohna-Schlodien
and his crew of the German com
merce raider Moewe, are the heroes
of Germany today. All the lierlin
pap rs pay tribute in their editorials
to the exploits of the Moewe and Its
gallt.nt commander and sailors who
captured 15 entente ships during the
commerce-destroying cruise in the
Atlantic ocean while fleet British
cruiners were searching everywhere
for the elusive vessel.
German experts declare the suc
cessful return of the Moewe to a
home port was its greatest feature.
When It set sail, thty -ay, it was
expected that it would be able to
sink a number of merchantmen, but
there was never any hope that it
wou d be able to return. That it
was able to do so they declare Is
substantial evidence that Britain's
threatened blockade of Germany
couli never be maintained.
Bestowal of the iron cros upon
Count von Dohna-Schlodien and the
crew of the Moewe i3 omy one of the
honors to be given the able com
mander and his men. Th" count, it
is announced, has been invited to
