Cleveland, Ohio.. Mar. C
Mrs. Newton 1). Hiker, wife of
the new secretary of war-elect,
was prosecuting a number of al
leged had egg dealers as leader
of the Housewives League when
she heard the news. She said:
"I seems to he fate that .Mr.
T)nl;er, who belongs to .tltuost
every peace society in the world
should he named, lint I feel
he owes this duty to his coun
try, which is demanding every
service that can he given. I am

any pricer. ' "
Washington, Mar (i. Newton D. Bak
er, former mayor of Cleveland, is Presi
de. it Wibon's choice for secretary of
r, the White House admitted today.
He twice declined the portfolio of sec
retary of the interior when President
Wilson formed his cabinet.
Newton Diehl Baker retired as mayor
of Cleveland, Ohio, on January 1, after
four years service in that office.
His first experience in public life was
in Washington as private secretary to
Postmaster General M illiam L. Wilson,
in (Irover Cleveland's second adminis
tration. Wilson came from Baker's
state, West Virginia. After the elec
tion of McKinley to the presidency,
Baker moved to Cleveland and became
junior law partner to a close friend
of Tom I.. Johnson, afterward the fa
mous "people's mayor," of Cleveland.
Johnson was attracted by the your
man, and when, in 1901,' Johnson be
came mayor he had Baker named as as
sistant city solicitor. Shortly afterward
Maker became city solicitor, and served
in that office until Johnson was de
feated in 10(19.
In 1011 Baker himself was elected
mayor of Cleveland, and was re elected
in 1013. He was not a candidate in
3!'15 when his party went out of mu
nicipal office in Cleveland.
Baker is studious, small, spectacled
man. He is noted in his home city as
having no intimate friends, preferring
to bury himself in his study when not
engaged on public business.'
His friendship for President Wilson
dated from Baker's fight In the nation
al democratic convention at Baltimore,
when he made the fight against the
unit rule that practically insured Wil
son's nomination. Baker led the mii
orltv of the Ohio delegation that favor
ed Wilson.
Baker was born in Mnrtiushurg. W.
Va., December 3. 1S71. and was grad
uated from Johns Hopkins and Wash
ington and I.ee universities.

Reginn, Sask., March (1. When the

Fridav involving cabinet ministers,
stateif everything would be referred to

investigation invited. All of the gov

the disposal of the judiciary, he de
clared. For the ministry he entered complete
denial of w rong doing. The chief sub

circles today is the sudden death of
John F. Lindsay. He was under arrest
charged with stealing li.OUII from the

London, Mar. fi. Official announce

fighting almost ceased during the night.
On the east bank of the Meuse, north

ture of 14 French officers and 0114 men.
Paris did not mention this, dismissing
all infantry engagements with the state
ment that they were "unimportant."
There was, however, severe artillery
battling on the left bank of the Meuse,
west of Douaumont and on the Woevrc

Sail Over Several Counties
Killing Three Men, Four
Women, Five Children
London, ' March (i. Zeppelin raiders
killed 12 persons and injured 33 in an
attack on the northeast const of Eng
land last night, it was officially an
nounced today. Two raiders dropped
bomb in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Hut
land, Huntington, Cambridge, Norfolk,
Essex and Kent.
The dead are three men, four women
and five children.
Although tho original admiralty
statement declared two Zeppelins par
ticipated, it is now believed three took
part in the attack.
Forty bombs were dropped, wrecking
nouses on two terraces and damaging
several shops.
The counties of Yorkshire. Lincoln
shire, iS'orfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon,
r.ssex, tvent and Kntland, raided by
Zeppelins, extend along the east coast
of England from the southermost part
of the island almost to tho Scottish
border. They are thickly populated
and fringed with seaside resorts.
The raid's extent is perhaps the
greatest in the war's history. It was
the twenty-first and Drought the total
of killed by German air bomlrs up to
242, while 4D2 have been injured. Sev
eral largo munition manufacturing
towns arc within the affected area. The
counties of Essex and Kent adjoin Lon
don. "Soaring high over the towns and cities
in their path, the Zeppelins showered
high explosive a id 'M endiir.v bombs on
the homes of workingmen, according to
the admiralty account. One entire
block crumpled in a whirl of fire and
smoke as the missies descended.
In the ruins of a wrecked dwelling an
aged woninn, bedridden seven years,
was found uninjured. She did not re
ceive a scratch.
After crossing inl.ind from the east
coast, the air fleet moved eastward. It
was ovserved to change its course re
peatedly, finally soaring in a huge
circie nign overhead, evidently uncer
tain of its position. Finally one of
the Zeppelins detached itself from the
squadron and hovered motionless over a
village, dumping a veritable hnil of ex
plosives upon the houses, until its sun-
ply was evidently exhausted. Then it
rose suddenly to a great hcightn and
vanished, the glare from burning build
ings illuminating it dimly against the
skv until it wis lost to view.
Southern Pacific Sits Up and
Takes Notice of Some
i Caustic Criticism
The visit of William Spronle, presi
dent of the Southern Pacific, railway
system, to the offices of t lie Public Ser
vice Commission today was productive
of two personal promises from the pres
ident which indicate that the present
car shortage will begin to decrease at
once. President Sproule promised the
public service commissioners that Su
perintendent l. W. Campbell would be
returned to Oregon within ,'tlt d ijs to
nssuine personal charge of the traffic
situation in this state and that u car
distribution bureau would be estab
lished at once to facilit ite the efforts
of the commission to relieve the cur
shotage.
The public service commission has
made a careful study of the present car
shortage which today is siiid to be about
2,001) cars In Oiegon on tho S. P. lines
ind Commissioner Frank Miller states
that it is an ab-olute fact that the en
tire shortage exists on the Southern Pa
cific lines where thero is no competi
tion. Tiie records of the office show
H at there is no severe car shortage in
California and although Mr. Sproule
maintains there is no discrimination in
iiregon it is admitted that with his
headquarters in San Francisco he is
out of clo-e personal touch wit.i condi
tions in Iregon.
When I). W. Campbell was iu Oregon
the commission was nbie to treat direct
ly with an officer of the company who
had the authority to settle question but

SUBMARINE IS LEGAL
BUT ARMED TRADER NOT
Says United States Should Pay
No Attention to England's
Illegal Blockade .
By Carl W. Ackeiman.
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, via Amsterdam, March 6.
"Armed merchantmen arc the sjiipers
of the sea," declared Dr. Heckscher,
reichstag leader, "and the British ad
miralty by instructing merchantmen to
fire on submarines, began franctircur
wai'fLre on the seas."
Dr. Heckscher whoso position in the
reichstog is similar to that held by
Senator Stone as chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, dis
cussed the German-American contro
versy over armed merchantmen at some
length today.
"If an officer and 10 men in a hos
tile country saw a group of civilians
across the street armed with two or
three rifles the officers couldn't wait
until he had warned the civilians
before ordering his officers to shoot,"
said Dr. Heckscher. "That is an exam
ple of f ranctircuring and the same
principle applies on tho seas to mer
chantmen who snipe at submarines.
"The submarine is a legal sea weap
on as Secretary Lansing himself has
admitted, ana tne suiimnnne tnar ar
tempts to wnrn nn armed merchantman
puts itself iu grave danger, sinco it is
easily damaged.
"It i-s said that tho I'nited States
wants to settle the submarine question
with Germany before taking up her
trade relations with England, holding
that questions affecting human lives
should be first. Conceding this view
point, does America realize how many
thousands of women and children in
Germany and Poland lack nourishment
today became America doesn't insist
on tho right to send milk and food to
the German people. Isn't that a ques
tion of lives toot
"Germany has waited for months for
America to take steps against Eng
land's illegal blockade, but nothing has
been accomplished. Now Germany,
finding the English admiralty instruc
tions aboard tho steamer Woodfiehl
must act for herself. Germany's of
ficial declaration is but the counter-
step any belligerent would tnke against
an enemy."
