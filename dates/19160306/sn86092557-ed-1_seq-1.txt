(Special to The Wat Vlrtrinlan.)
WASHINGTON. D. C.. March G.?
What may turn out to bo the adminis
tration's bill for tho creation of a
tariff-commission, as a sequence to
President Wilson's recent public
statement reversing his previous
views and favoring the establishment
of such a body, was introduced in
the House of Representatives this at-,
ternoon by Representative M. M.
Neely, of the First West Virginia dis
triTlie bill is the result of much labor
upon the part of its author, many
conferences with administration lead
ers and, it is claimed, embodies some
suggestions by the President himself,
after he had read tho original draft
and discussed its provisions with Mr.
Neely. Under instructions from admin
istration leaders, the 1)111, and parti
cularly the lengthy and detailed ex
planation of Its various provisions
given out at the Neely office by Secre
tary Nickerson, was distributed to
every Washington correspondent and
news agency in advance to insure Its
countrywide reading. This is taken to
mean that the Neely MU' has the part
ial endorsement of the administration
and that much depends upon its re
ception by the country, and the ensu
ing discussion, wheither the favor ?*
the President and his advisors for the
proposed measure will continue.
On the framing of this bill, Mr.
Neely admits to having been given in
valuable assistance from leading con
stitutional lawyers "J*
in&r-'experts tariff* W^tfwthe.dis
research work. He expresses pride in
the result of his work and strong
hopes that it will meet with the ap
proval of Congress and be. eventually
enacted into law, as representing the
majority party's reversal of its time
