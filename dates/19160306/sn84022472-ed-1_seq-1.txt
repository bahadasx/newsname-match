Some of the bombs dropped by the
aircraft were incendiary and some ex
plosive. In one instance a fall of snow
had just preceded an attack and the
Zeppelin overhead was seen to remain
stationary above . the spot for several
minutes.
An official statement' lssused in Lon
don last night said two hostile airships
had crossed over the northeast coast
of England. At that time their move
ments had not been defined clearly.
Some bombs had been dropped, which
fell into the sea near the shore.
The number of casualties reported
is much less than that of the previous
Zeppelin raid, in which 5 7 persons
were killled and 117 persons injured.
This raid, made on Jan 31, was over
the middle eastern counties.

RUSSIAN FLEET
EXTENDS SCOPE
OF ITSACTIVITY
Petrograd, March 6. The Russian
Black sea fleet is extending the scope
of its operations far to the westward
of Trebizond and has bombarded the
mouth of the Terma river, where a
fleet of sailing vessels had taken ref
uge. The Terma is 210 miles west of
Trebizond.
Thirty miles east of the Terma, the
fire of the warshipe, aestroyed barri
cades and depots and many Turkish
craft. Along the coast line, included
between these two points, the -Russians
during the last few days, have sunk
more than 30 sailing vessels laden with
war supplies.
The civil population of Trebizond Is
reported to have virtually all left the
city, those remaining falling victims,
according to advices received here, to
the demoralized Turkish soldiers who
are said to be looting stores and
houses and creating a reign of terror.
The Russian front southward of the
Caucasian theatre extends for a dis
tance of 270 mile.''. Military critics : T
emphasize the caution and delibera
tion which are characterizing the ad
vance along this whole front, the dif
ficulties of which multiply daily with
the increasing distance from the Rus
sian basis ia contrast with the impetu

HARITIES BOARD
Commissioners in Annual
Meeting Not In Agree
ment on Candidates.
ELLIS OPPOSES MOVE
TO OUST DR. BEAUDRY
Walter Garrity, Bridgeport
Brass Co. Clerk, to Suc
ceed Thomas F. Cox.
This is the1 slate wiich the board
of charities is likely to elect, at its
annual meeting, which was called for !
late this afternoon at the police and j
charities building:
Superintendent, Spencer R. Gor
don, re-elected for one year.
Clerk, Walter Garrity, 505 Park
avenue, to succeed Thomas F.
Cox.
Investigator, Alexander F. Mor
rissey, re-elected.
Outside poor physician, Francis
P. Carroll, Bridgeport hospital,
succeeding Dr. George B. Garlick.
Superintendent of Lakeview
Home, Dr. John J.' MacDonald,
re-elected.
Stenographer, charities head
quarters, Miss Elizabeth Merry,
re-elected.
Family visitor, Mrs. Mabel L.

Family visitor (new), Mrs; Jo
hanna Silvey, 153 Lewis street.
Children's agent, stationed at .
Fresh Air Home, Fairfield, Miss
Clara Fouper, re-elected.
Druggist, Alexander MacPher
son, at present transfer ambulance
driver and-assistant pharmacist.
Ambulance driver, Aubrey F.
Burlison, re-elected.
Eye and ear specialist, Dr. D.
C. DeWolf e, re-elected.
Emergency hospital nurse. Miss
Kathryn Hehir, re-elected.
Night ambulance surgeon. Dr.
E. B. Weldon, re-elected.
Day ambulance surgeons, John
F. Canavan, succeeding Dr. Jo- -seph
H. Beaudry; Dr. George B.
Garlick, succeeding Dr. John H.
Finnegan.-
Lakeview Home staff, no .'
changes, , ' ' , '-.V;
. It is understood that there are sev?
eral of these offices in which the
commissioners are iiot wholly In ac
cord, and that there is a likelihood
of the calling of Mayor Wilson to
break ties, especially in the cases of
Dr. Joseph H. Beaudry and of the
clerkship, scheduled to be filled by
Garrity.
There will- be a new order of things
at the emergency hospital. Each
physician of the ambulance staff will
work six days a week. Dr. George B.
Garlick will be the hief of staff,
and will regulate the substitution of
physicians for members of the regu
lar staff.
The clerkship vacancy grows out of
the ousting of Clerk Thomas FCox.
Cox is both pharmacist and clerk of
the department. Cox and Gordon
have not worked in harmony.
The salary of Cox is $1,425 annual
ly. This salary will be split between
Garrity, a young man, at present em
ployed in the Bridgeport Brass Co.'s
office, and MacPherson, who, though
employed as transfer ambulance driv
er, has been acting in the pharmacy
under Cox. v
MacPherson has had experience on
pharmaceutical work. He is not a
licensed pharmacist, but the commis
sioners have been advised, that it is
not compulsory for them to employ a
licensed pharmacist. When prescrip
tions are called for, which MacPher
son will not compound, they will be
filled at the drugstores near the emer
gency hospital and dispensary. Gar
rity and MacPherson will share a part
of Cox's salary, and the remainder will
be used towards defraying the ex
pense of a new family visitor.
The post for which Girrity is slated
has beer sought on behalf of several
young women. It is not unlikely that
one of these will be. nominated this
afternoon.
The possibility of a tie vote on sev
eral of the position looms large. Pres
ident F. W. Behrens and Mrs. M. H.
Ford, according to report, are favor
ably inclined to Canavan for Beau
dry's post. Commissioner Ellis is not
likely to look with favor on this plan.
Commissioner Harris views are not
known, but it was reported this af
ternoon that he planned to attend the
meeting, in spite of ill health, to cast
his vote for Dr. Beaudry. This will
make a tie vote, and it may be neces
sary to break the tie through the in
tervention of Mayor Wilson.
Another position which may pre
cipitate trouble is that of physician
for outside poor. For this Dr. Ellis,
of the ambulance and emergency com
mittee, is favorably inclined towards
Dr. Edward W. Paine, 871 Park ave
nue. Dr. Carroll is said to be the
choice of President Behrens. Dr.
Carroll 1s a Hartford man. He is on
the Bridgeport hospital staff.
This forenoon Mayor Wilson, Presi
dent Behrens and Alexander J. H.
Robinson, the city, clerk, and chair
man of the Republican town com
mittee, spent several hours In con
ference. The salaries of the positions are;
Superintendent, $2,400; investigator,
$1,600; stenographer, $780; outside
poor physician, $1,500 (raised by tax
board at last meeting from $1,200);
family visitor, $750; superintendent of
pvipw, $1,500; children's agent.
Fresh Air home, $7.50; day physicians
al emergency hospital, $750; nig-ht
phvsicinn. $900; emergency hospital
nurse, $780; ambulance driver, $1,150,
eye and ear specialist, 53 00.

DIDN'T SHOOT TO
KILL, MARSHALL
ADVISES CORONER
Pulled Trigger Only To
"Frighten" Peter Deas, is
Negro 's Testimony.
"I didn't shoot to kill him. I shot
to frighten him.- I was told he had
a gun and I was afraid he would
kill me."
This is the statement made today to
Coroner John J. Phelan by Joseph
Marshall held for killing Peter Deas
during a row last Saturday night in
the shack at 584 Iranistan avenue.
Continuing Marshall told the cor
oner that a fight started between
Mrs. Violet Diggs of 1320 Chapel St.,
New Haven, and her brother, Robert
Valentine because the latter would
not pay his weekly room rent. All
are negroes. Mrs. Diggs furnished
the shack and rented to the men
coming here from New Haven each
week to collect her rent. Marshall
said when he interfered to save the
woman from a beating at the hands
of her brother, Deas struck him- with
a lighted lamp.
He said he was knocked down on
his bed and he thought Deas was
reaching for a revolver when he drew
his own revolver from beneath his pil
low and fired. Marshall is held with
. out bail. Mrs. Diggs, who says she
did not see the shooting, is held in
$500 bail. The ibonds for her brother
are $1,000. They have not been able to
obtain bail. The cases have been con
tinued for trial until after the cor-,
orer's investigation.
Charles Coleman and Albert Peter
son, who were witnesses of the shoot
ing, agreed in the main with Mar
shall's story. Marshall fired twice they
said one of the bullets going into
Deas' left temple. After the shooting
Marshall fled from the house and
went to a lunch room where he ate a
hearty meal. i
Sergeant John O'Connell caught
Marshall. He with Policemen Jere
miah Lavin and Thomas Walsh were
in the barn in the rear of the house
when about an hour later Marshall
returned. Sergeant O'Connell grabbed
him and the latter handed over the
gun and admitted that he had done
the shooting. He was taken to police
headquarters where he made a con

In Accord With Policies
of the President on U. S.
Defenses.
Washington, March 6 New
ton D. Baker, former Mayor of
Cleveland, has been selected byj
President Wilson as Secretary
of War.
Mr. Baker has accepted the
position and is now arranging.
his affairs in Cleveland pre
paratory to coming to Wash
ington to take up his duties.
Mr. Baker formerly was,
mayor of Cleveland. His name'
had been mentioned in connec- j
tion with the position several '
limes. He was offered a place
when the cabinet was formed
but declined.
The selection of Mr. Baker Is un
derstood to have been discussed by
President Wilson with Col. E. M.
House soon after the latter's arrival
here this morning.
. When President Wilson was mak
ing up his cabinet in 19 IS, he offer
ed the place of secretary of the in
terior to Mr. Baker twice. Mr. Baker
then was mayor of Cleveland and de
clined for that reason. The Presi-
dent- and Mr. Baker have been close j
friends for some time and have 'cor-
responded frequently.
Mr. Baker is said by his friends to
be in close sympathy with the Presi
dent's policies and Is Known to have
had the support of some members of
the cabinet for the war office:
When President Wilson recently
was touring the middle west on his
preparedness program, he saw Mr.
Baker at Cleveland, and had a long
talk with him. Mr. Baker has been
in Washington frequently of late and
on his last visit here said he had" not
been offered the post of secretary of
war and did not believe he would be.
Ever since Lindley M. Garrison re
signed, the President has been seek
ing a middle western lawyer for the .
place. .
At the White House today it wa
neither officially confirmed nor de
nied that Mr. Baker would get the
place. Officials strongly encouraged
the use of his name and it was un
derstood that Mr. Baker had been de
finitely selected.
The 30 day period for which Major
General Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff,
was designated secretary of war ad
interim, will expire March 11. It is
believed Mr. Baker's nomination will
be sent to the Senate before that time.
Mr. Baker is 44 years old. He was
born in Martinsburg, W. Va., and at the
age of 25 was appointed private secre
tary to Postmaster-General Wilson in
President Cleveland's cabinet. In 1897
he began the practice of law at JNlar
tinsburg but not long thereafter moved
to Cleveland where he became city
solicitor in 1902. He held this office for
10 vears until his election as mayor. In
1914 he was re-elected mayor for a
two year term. Mr. Baker in July,
1902, married Miss Elizabeth Leopold,
of Pottstown, Pa
Mr. Baker has received degrees at
Johns Hopkins and Washington & Lee
Universities. For years Mr. Baker has
been closely identified with the reform
movement in Cleveland and has taken
an active part in the street railway
controversy.
Second Panel Drawn
For Month's Trials
Because of Business
Because of the great amount of jurj
business at the present term of th
civil superior court and the fact that
some of the present jurors have served
more than two months it has been
found necessary to draw a second
panel for this month's trials.. There
are a sufficient number of cases as
signed to furnish business for . two
months more.
