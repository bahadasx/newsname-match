An Old American Institution That Never Goes Out of
Style -Things To Be Thankful For and How
To Show Thankfulness
The president of the United States
and the governors of the various
States of the Union have proclaimed
Thursday November 30th as a day
set apart for the purpose of return
ing thanks to Almighty God for his
manifold blessings upon the nation
wt its peopje.
-"Xhtt the American people have
many blessings for which they might
and should return thanks, many that
all the people of the nation should be
thankful for some that only a part
of the people have reason to be thank
ful for and a few that only a very
few of the people have reason to be
thankful for, is known to all.
All American citizens have reason
to return thanks that their land is
not in the throes of a devesting war;
that in a large measure all the peo
ple are free to follow the pursuits of
(peaee and that in spite of high prices,
.famine does not threaten nor is there
danger of a pestilence that shall cut
down the population with the grim
scythe of death. For a produc
tive and fertile land unscar
red by the destruction of war;
for harvests that are prac
tically inexhaustible; for a Govern
ment that is controlled by the people,
founded upon the principles of liber-
ty, Justice and right, that exists for
- the purpose of bettering the condi
tions of all classes alike and minister
ing to the welfare of all, that main
tains a system of free education un
surpassed in' the history of education
and protects its citizens in their in
dustrial, commercial and social activities-
Let us all be sincerely and
profoundly thankful!
The wage of prosperity that has
included a large part of the popula
tion of this land since the outbreak of
the European war in 1914 is of such
a nature that it would seem almost
aacreligious to express thanks for,
and yet there are some who profited
largely and many more who other
wise would have been out of employ
ment have been enabled to earn good
wages because of these extraordinary
conditions The few who have some
things to be thankful for are apt to
be that class of persons who forget
to be thankful for anything and that
is a dangerous condition to get in:
Dangerous for individuals themselves
and dangerous for the community.
There are very few whatever their
circumstances in life who have not
omthlng to be thankful for; whon
they have found and reoognized those
things fof which they have reason to
be thankful, they have found the
means by which they may rise to bet
ter and larger things, and herein lies
one great value of thanksgiving.
The generally accepted method of
expressing thanks among the Ameri
' can people is to make a holiday of
the day set apart by official procla- J
mation the principal feature of which
ia a big dinner; this is alright as far
as it goes providing of course that
people have the means amd opportun
ity of providing themselves with the
dinner; but this does not seem to us
to be the sort of Thanksgiving dem
onstration that will be of greatest
value to' the giver of thanks or the
one that is entirely commensurate
with the gift and blessings receiv
ed. '
. There are some, not the majority
who lwill attend some religious ser
vice, but even this may not go as deep
as it ought to or accomplish all the
good that genuine thankfulness ought

There are not many who may not
find themselves in better circum
stances than some one else. It may
safely be said that there is no one so
destitute that they mag not by some

simple word or deed of kindness, goodj
cheer or helplulness help somebody
else less' favored or less happy than
themselves- This approaches an ideal
expression of thankfulness; that each
one give of what he has to give, be it
small or large to some others who
have not and who stand in need or
distress. This kind of thanksgiving
need not be confined to one day . in
the year it better be spread over
every day in the year for its benefits
are, as great upon those who give in
this way as upon those who receive.
Such an expression of thankfulness
is in fact the real and true signifi
cance of the word, thanks-giving. '
We find ourselves in hearty accord
with the following extracts from
President Wilson's Thanksgiving pro
clamation: "The year that has elapsed since we
last observed our day of Thanksgiv
ing, has been rich in blessings to us
as a people, but the whole face of the
world has been darkened by war. In
the midst of our peace and happiness,
our thoughts dwell with painful dis
quiet upon the struggles and suffer
ings of the nations at war, and of the
peoples upon whom war has brought
disaster without choice or possibility
of escape on their part. We cannot
think of our own happiness without,
thinking of their pitiful distress-
And I also urge and suggest our
duty,, in this, our day of peace and
abundance, to think in deep sym
pathy, of the stricken peoples of the
world upon whom the curse and ter
ror of war has so pitilessly fallen and
to contribute out of our abundant
means to the relief of their suffer
ings." Our people could in no better way
show , their real attitude toward the
present struggle of the nations than
by contributing out of their abund
ance to the relief of the suffering
which war has brought in its train.

MUTUAL APPRECIATION
At the Fulton County Teachers' In
stitute held in Fayette last Summer
the one .instructor whom all the teach
ers liked was Professor C. O. Hoyt of
the Michigan State Normal College at
Ypsilanti; in fact they were so well
pleased that these teachers got to
gether to plan some way by which
they could express their appreciation
of Professor Hoyt in a tangible man
ner; the result was that they deter
mined to present him with a rod and
reel which he might use in vacation
time when by stream and lake the
professor might follow the precepts
and practice of Izaack Walton.
In due course of time the rod and
reel were procured and forwarded to
the Professor. Recently this letter
of acknowledgement and appreciation
was received:
November 15, 1916
Mr. Walter Brown,
Wauseon, Ohio.
Dear Mr Brown:
I am in receipt of an elegant rod
and reel sent to me by the teachers of
Fulton County. I never expected to
own anything quite as nice as that,
and I wish you to convey to the
teachers of Fulton my sincerest thanks
My work in Fulton county was more
pleasant than any I have had for a
large number of years, and I shall al
ways hold the teachers of that coun
ty in the highest regard, and then to
have this beautiful expression of your
kindness come to me, it certainly
gladdens my heart. When spring
comes and I begin to cast out the bait,
I can see no earthly reason why the
bass would not jump out of the water
and meet me half way.
Again thanking you all, and wish
ing you every pleasure and success
in life, with best wishes I am
Sincerely yours,
C. O. HOYT,
Professor of Philosophy and Educa-
tion.

Board of Health Asks Questions,
A group of gentlemen represent
ing a Mauseoleum building associa
tion entertained the councilmen and
cemetery trustees at the council meet
ing last Monday night with some very
fine desertations on the mausoleum
method of burial and incidentally ex
plained the superiority of the particu
lar mauseoleum which this company
is engaged in constructing over all
kinds, types, -designs and manner of
last resting places for the dead.
The main points were the beauty of
the exterior construction, the abso
lute protection of the bodies of loved
ones, perfect sanitation durability and
certain endowment fund for the per
manent maintainence-
The talks were very interesting and
instructive, but none of the council
men or the trustees seemed to be con
vinced that they would care to rest
even in one of these absolutely up to
date crypts, not just at present and'
moreover as they have pending nego
tiations with another ' Mausoleum
building concern at the present time
no proposition from the Toledo peo
ple could be entertained and after, an
exchange of courtesies the Mausoleum
builders departed and the councilmen
came down to the prosaics of sewers
sidewalks and State Board of Health
demands.
A sewer on East Elm street plug
ged with feathers by the carelessness
of employees of one of the poultry
dressing concerns in the east end of
town occupied the consideration and
attention of the councilmen for some
time,, the street commissioner was
instructed to .try the fire hose and
the maximum water pressure on the
obstruction in the sewer under con
sideration and if that failed, to dig

REPUDIATION
As a Republican newspaper we wish
hereby to express our candid opinion
in regard to the Cincinnati Republi
can, a paper that comes to our office:
We believe that the name is a mis
nomer for we do not find very much
Republicanism in , it. Its chief pur
pose seems to be to belittle and be
smirch the name of Governor Frank
B. Willis in particular and the rest
of the Republican- candidates State
and National, in general. From the
point of view of this sheet, the in
competency of the Republican State
central committee was stupendous and
it seems to be very successful in
thinking up all the things that Gov
ernor Willis is not and publishing
them as the true presentation of
what he is-
SURE! WE'RE PROUD OF HIM
Bryan Heise is another of our Wau
seon boys of whom we have every
reason to be proud because he is re
flecting honor upon his home town.
The Columbus Dispatch of Wednesday
November 15th contained the follow
ing: Bryan Heise of Wauseon, sopho
more in the college of arts at Ohio
State university, has been elected
president of the Ohio organization
of the Inter-college Prohibition asso
ciation He is the third Ohio State
student to be thus honored in the last
three years, the others being Glenn W
Foster of Coshocton, last year, and
Earl F. Baumm of Toledo, the year
previous.
TO THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATURE
Mr. C. W. Hallett is in receipt of a
letter from his brother W. .B. Hal
lett a former resident of Wauseon,
announcing the fact that he has been
officially notified that he has been
elected to the office of State Repre
sentative from his home city of Kala
rilazoo, Michigan-
Kalamazoo is normally 1500 to 2000
Republican in presidential years. Mr.
Hallett is a Democrat and there is no
party paper published in the county
but he won by a majority of 500 votes
showing that he must have received
at least 1000 Republican votes. Mr.
Hallett is the manager of The Bee

A Land Where Americans Look Good
to Each Other Where The Climate
is Perfect and the People Bright
Alert and Interesting-
By Mrs. F. E. Kenyon.
Does distance lend enchantment?
Well perhaps it does, anyway Ameri
cans down here look and sound mighty
good to us. We are fortunate to be
located in this place, there were six
American teachers here before we
came and the mother of one girl is
here Mo- The mother and daughter
are from Utica, New York, and we
like them very much.
There is an American young man,
Mr Knapp, from Buffalo, New York,
a graduate of Cornell University,
boarding here at the hotel . For the
last three days he has been sitting at
our table. You people who have
plenty of fine young men to talk with
cannot imagine what an acquisition he
is. He has been here with the Irri
gation Service six years, going home
once in that time On account of hav
ing his residence here he has never
had a chance to vote. Mr. Knapp has
promised me some items in regard to
the service .which may be of interest
in another letter- I am becoming much
interested in the Country and the peo
ple and I now appreciate the prob
lems, educational and political, as I
never could have done by any amount
of reading. The people are supposed
to be slow, but they are very impres
sionable, highly sensitive and musical.
The school pupils are bright and alert
and have splendid memories.
We were invited to attend a con
cert and dance at the Casino last Fri
day .evening but the affair was post
poned until next Friday, on account
of the very rainy weather. The con
cert program looked very good to
me with the names of such composers
as ; "Paderewski," "Pacini" and
"Moszkoswski."
The climate surpasses even ones
fairest dreams- There is always a
lovely breeze and here in the hotel it
is delightfully .comfortable, though in
the streets it is rather hot in the mid
dle of the day when the sun shines.
The air is never chilly and there
seems to be no difference between day
and night in temperature and such
moonlight! The atmosphere is so
clear that its brilliancy is beautiful
Some of our American friends were
calling on us last evening and we went
out on the balcony over looking the
Plaza, beyond which there is a fine old
Catholic church and beyond this the
mountains. We watched the moon ap
pear from behind the heavy clouds
overhanging the mountains. It was
a wonderful scene and no words can
express the beauty of it-
On account of the heavy rains
rivers have been very high, some
thrilling experiences have been re
lated. One American young man in
