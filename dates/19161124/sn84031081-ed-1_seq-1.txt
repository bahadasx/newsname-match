"Since Craiova was conquered, the

dominate the situation In the western
part of Rumania; the so-called small

Impede the advance into this part Of

Which is proved by the great efforts
they made near Orsova and their ex
traordinarily stubborn resistance in
the JUil valley.
"AH these desperate efforts, how
ever, were unable to diver) the fate of
