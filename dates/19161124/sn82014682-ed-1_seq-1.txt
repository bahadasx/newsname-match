' Many .weeks" ago the Star-Bulletin
' forecast Coke's selection, on the basis
of authoritative news from, Washing-

It is therefore conjectured that as

After he was hero a short time he
went to Maui In the . latter part of
1898 and remained there for 11 years.
'He frved on Maul as prosecuting and
; county attorney with .success. Com

: Democratic ticket with one of the
biggest votes ever given on Oahu. He
served two terms In the senste, re
signing as previously related.
He has recently been serving as at
torney for the public utilities commis

Mr. Coke is 41 years of age one of

in.imerview ..: , .
That the order of the public utilities
commission In the Inter-Island case
will; in all probability be ready for
tho printer within two more weeks is
the statement made today by Chair
man Charles R, Forbes of , the terri
torial body. Forbes intimates during
the course of conversation that It
will be "some" order. L
"We of the commission have been
keeping; up closely with the evidence
as it has come in from time to time,?
said the chairman today. "I liave been
writing all the time on it ana i uuna
It will not take more than two weeks
before it is ready for printing. I hope
to have the hearing finished in a few
days.;-. :-. V- ; ;
' ."This Is the first time that an in
vestigation of such magnitude has
been conducted in the territory, and
the public is vitally interested In it
and will want to know reasons for the
commissioner's order which can only
be obtained after complete Investiga
tion. " - ' : ' ; .... .; ; '
"Like all new commissions, no mat
ter how efficient they are,, this one
has been the subject of more or less
criticism for the simple reason that it
Is holding; forth In a country where
service, corporations have previously
operated without restriction." '
After the hearing is completed, the
chairman says, the commissioners
will get together In. conferences or
sessions: for discussion of. the order.
This will mean conferences, not hear
Ings, he added smiling. In explana
tion of the careful and detailed inves
tigation that is being made of. the
auditor's report he said:
. "A mass of figures was found in the
books of the company, and along with
this mass there are conclusions drawn
by the auditor. The Inter-Island has
questioned the propriety of these con
clusions. So the commission began
an Investigation of the report review
ing It page by page and allowing
cross-examination.
"After this has all been argued the
figures will be checked over and veri
fied and both sides given in full. This
gives the company a -chance to explain
their procedures and the' commission
a chance to get testimony on why cer
tain funds are reported as book ac
counts instead of tangible.' This pro
cedure has been followed by all util
ity commissions, especially in detail
by that of California.

NEED FOR REVENUE
MIGHT BRING ACTION
Possibility of Consumers' Tax
Canvassed But It is Most
Unlikely
By C. S. ALBERT
(Special 8Ur BwllU" Crrppondmc)
WASHINGTON, I). C Nov. 1 2.
The status of sugar promises to re
main unchanged as a result of the re
cent elections. The only chance for a
better protective duty hinged on a
complete -reversal of conditions. This
required the election of a Republican
president, senate and house. Not one
of these expectations has been realized
though the house will probably, be
slightly. RcpubLcan.
Although control of the house may
be In doubt It is a safe assumption
that the i Democrats, Socialists and
other minor tactions' will dominate.
With the disaffection of such Demo
crats as favor-higher rates for sugar
it might be possible to pass a measure
in that body restoring the terms of the
Payne-Aldrich act. '
The process of remedial legislation
would stop right there. The senste
seems to be certainly 54 Democrats to
42. Republicans. Allowing that' four
Democrats, including the two senators
from Louisiana, would cooperate with
the Republicans there would be no
possibility, of favorable action! Even
If a miracle could be performed the
president's .veto wduld still constitute
an impossible barrier to success.
.Tariff legislation in which sugar
!td4M t?nfited aecms entireivut
of the question. The Democrats are
disposed - to let the Underwood
Simmons law work out its own salvation-
until the present European War
la ended. Beyond that point no one
can make predictions and escape -the
insane asylum. t -;
The' only possible Juggling with
sugar might arise in connection with
the necessity for additional revenues
to keep the governmental wheels re
volving. This would not come In the
form of restoring -the remainder of
the Payne-Aldrlch rates. It would
take the : form of a consumer's tax.
This would be collected at the refin
eries and be paid by the consumer
purchasing the refined product for
retailing.. A mite would be contrib
uted 'by all thosa using sugar as a
necessity or luxury.
The imposition of a consumer's tax
on sugar was much discussed during
the last session of Congress. It was
thrown aside because.of great unpopu
larity. It will not be brought up ex
cept in the last extremity.
Hence, the sifgar planter must fig
ure oh the present without much ref
erence to the future. No Hope Is held
out for the producers of I-oulalana.
The existing status seems certain to
remain unchanged unless monetary
necessities make some additional form
of taxation essential.
