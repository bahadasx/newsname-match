Some very heated discussions
have been taking place during
the past few dsys over Baxter's
water works problem.
For several weeks the citv
council has bad nnder considers
tion an application for a franchise
! to instal a new water plant to
take tbe place of ibe plant now
xejrving tbe city.
The applicant is Herbert
Wheeler of Joplin. Last Tues
dav niebt Mr. Wheeler was in
Baxter at tbe call of tbe coundl,
it is said, and the council held a
special meeting to confer .with
l.im about the franchise.
Somehow the rumor got noised
about that tbe councii.or a major
ity thereof, had planned to grant
tbe franchise that night. The
rumor was erroneous, evidently,
for the franchise was not granted.

Water Plants.
"The News bas a clipping from
the St. Louis Republic of March
30,' 1913, showing that at that
time out of 200 municipalities in
- Kansas having water works all
but 13 owned their own plants.
In Nebraska in August, 1914,
out of 17& municipalities having
waterworks 169 owned their own
ed plants, leaving only 8 towns
that at that time were-furnished
with water private systems and
one town which received water
from municipal plant in an" ad
jointing city. In cities of the
third class, similar in size to Bax-
' ter, the municipal rate is from
7 to 60 cents per 1009 gallons,
.while the private rate is from 35
to 80 cents. Without exception
the service is tetter from munici
pal plants than from privately
owned plants. One very distinct
advantage of the municipal plant
is that the city always is willing
...to serve every house in the cor-.
. rotation, while private water
companies draw the line at isolat
ed residences. There is noargu
. meat in figures of this kind, all
is in favor of the. municipally
owned plant.

desired that the members of tbe
council should hear Mr. Palmer,
but Mayor Willard had called
the' special meeting to talk with
Mr. Wheeler and on that account
tbe councilmen did not attend
the Commercial Club meeting.
Mr. Palmer, who bad read tbe
proposed franchise now before
j the council, strongly condemned
it as unfit and unfair and recom
1 mended that the city should not
tie up with such a contract,
p He urged the citizens to use
I their influence to induce tbe

to go more thoroughly into tbe

Mr. Palmer recommended that
before taking action Baxter's
city council should have two
propositions prepared in detail.
First have an estimate ai to tbe
needs and cost of a municipally
owned plant, and tbe schedule of
rates that would be necessary to
make tbe plant pay its way and
eventually pay eff the bonds.
Second, have a franchise drawn
up thaf would be . fait to the ap
plicant and at the sams time pro
tect the city in every particular,
guaranteeing a schedule of
charges and tbe quality of service.
7itfetB two prcpositiara at
hand the city council should take
the public intuits confidence.
Call a meeting for the jconsidera
tion of the subject and then leave
it up to taxpayers to decide
whether they wish to have a
municipal plant or prefer to
award a -franchise igr a private
company. ' '. -
In case a private 'plant should
appear the most desirable then
the franchise as prepared br the
city should first be offered to the
company at present serving tbe
city. If that'cotnpjoy should
turn it down then , give Mr.
Wheeler pr some otbir company
a chance. Should the franchise
as prepared to protect the city's
interests not be desirable to any
private concern then the city
still has the alternative of voting
bonds and installing a plant of
its own.
At tbe conclusion of the meet
ing of the citizens Thursday
night a committee was appointed
to prepare a petition to be circu
lated for signers and presented
to the council.
. In the petition' tbe plan out
lined above is set forth and the
council is rrquested to take no
action until such information
has been secured and the whole
matter submitted to the public to
decide.-'
Different members of the coun
cil with whom the News man
has conferred appear disposed to
respect the wishes of the tax
payers in this matter and there
ii no doubt that the whole thing
ill adjust itself satisfactorily
and when Baxter does get a new
water service it will be amp'e
and reliable and run in the in-
interests of those who will be
called upon to foot tbe bills. At
any rate it is to h hoped that !
the progress of the city will not
be blocked by bigoted adhesion
to personal ideas or interests.

Rev. C. W. Yard, who has been
conducting a grocery store in
Baxter for the past year has sold
bis business to J. W. Cook, the
corner groceryman. Mr. Cook
will vacate thecorner and occupv
the building at present occupied
by Mr. Yard. The corner build
ing it is rumored has been leased
by the new owners to a general
merchandise firm, which will
begin business shortly after Mr.
Cook vacates. Rev. Yard will
not reengage in business, for the
present at least, but more than
likely will devotehis time and
efforts to the ministry wbich
profession, he followed for more
than forty years prior to coming
to Baxter Springs. The News
together with numerous other
friends, hopes that Rev. and Kirs.
Yard, will find it to the best
interests of their work and welfare
to continue to reside in th: city.
A lady from out of town who
had to just hang around". tho
stores one day this week while
her husband's auto was being
repaired, remarked that the first
garage that is thoughtful enough
to provide a rest room for ladies
will get a lot of business on tbe
strength of the innovation in
Baxter. Tbe suggestion surely
is worthy the attention of Bax
ter's automobile dealers.

Judging from the amount of
railroad talk passing around in
Baxter and in neighboring citietr
it appears not a question now of
what kind of a new railroad
Baxter can get, but rather how
many she wants.
Several companies have their
eyes on this coming metropolis;
in fact several have already gone
to the expense of making surveys
into the city. ,
One is already assured; that is
the Southwest Missouri In ter ur
ban wich has not only announced
its decision to build from Ga
lena, but already has construe
tion under way and material on
the ground.
This week The New man as
certained from a reliable source
that the Oklahoma and Northern
Interurban company will come
into Baxter with its new line,
now building from Bartlesville,
Okla., to Joplin. We- look for
definite news from this campany
in a few days. It is not a pro
motion scheme; but financed by
some very. wealthy oil men and
surely bas every appearance of
being genuine. This company
says that it will come into Baxter
if a suitable franchise can be te
cured and adds that it will be
the first new road to get into
town.'
During the fast week J. R.
Rose, well known railroad pro
moter, ' was in Baxter,- accom
panied by Indian Agent Ira C
D-'aver. They came to negotiate
tor a right of way for another
railroad from the Picher-Cardin
district into Baxter. Mr. Rose
has been working on railroad pro
jects in this vicinity for- several
months but as yet has never
brought any of them to a reality
He declares that he now bas bis
proposition financed.
Still another railroad proposi
tion, and one which most vitally
concerns Baxter is tbe revival of
the rumor that the O. K. & M.
railroad, which at present runs
out of Mia ma up through the
mining towns and as for as Blue
Mound, is planning on extending
into Baxter soon. The News has
good authority for the statement
that the company wants to come
here and could be induced to
build now if Baxter people were
willing, to offer some assistance
in the matter of securing a right
of-way. Tbe subject will very
likely be brought to the attention
of the Commercial Club. A line
from here down into the mining
district would add tremendously
to the business and prosperity cf
Baxter and every month the
building is delayed is costing
this city thousands of dollars in
trade. . .
A rumor was in circulation
last week that because of the
Southwest Missouri bad refused
to accede to the demands of the
city of Galena that its cars to
Baxter be ran over certain city
streets, that town would -: not
grant a franchise to the railroad
and in "conscanence the road
Pastoricould not be built. There is 00
truth in such a rumor. It is safe
to bet that the road will be built
regardless of Galena's demand.
The Galena evening Times of
Tuesday, intimates that thtroad
has decided to' run around that
city, instead "of through, it, be
cause the city council has been
too exacting in its demands, and
suggested that the council should
no longer split hairs over the
matter. The paper also asks
t le Community Club and business
men to come to the rescue and
poll for the Rogers ettniloa to
cits through Qaleaa and not to
the south of tbe city, where it is
understood a survey has already
