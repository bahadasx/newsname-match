Explosion
200 OF CREW ARE MISSING
Vessel Was One of the Three Modern
Dreadnoughts of Russian Navy
and Was Built In 1914.
London, Nov. 24. Russia officially
announces at Petrograd the loss of
the dreadnought Imperatrltsa Maria.
A statement issued lust night reads.
"The Russian dreadnought Impera
trltsa Maria has been sunk by an In
ternal explosion. Two hundred of the
crew are missing."
" Early In November a report was
In circulation that the Imperatritsa
Maria had gone to the bottom in the
Black sea and that nearly all of her
crew had perished. Later on Novem
ber 11, Berlin reported by wireless
that a Bulgarian headquarters dfs
patch announced that a fireman on
the battleship had reached the Bul
garian coast and confirmed the de
struction of the dreadnought, which
it was stated had been sunk by a mine
near Sullna, or Feodossia island, at
the mouth of the Danube.
The Imperatritsa Maria was a new
dreadnought. She was launched in
1914 and displaced 22.600 tons. Her
officers and crew numbered about 1000
men. The vessel was 550 feet long
and had a draft of 27 feet. Sho was
armed with 10 12-inch, 20 5-inch and
four 2-5-inch guns and four three
pounders and four torpedo tubes.
The Russian naval staff, saya a
Reuter dispatch from Petrograd, has
Issued the following statement: "At
6 o'clock on October 20 fire broke out
in the forward magazine of the Im
peratritsa Maria. An Internal explo
sion followed immediately and the fire
spread rapidly and reached the petrol
tanks. The officers and crew strove
with the utmost bravery to localize
the effects of the explosion and flood
the magazines. The commander-in-chief,
Vice-Admiral Koisohak, went
aboard and took personal command
of the operations.
"Shortly after 7 o'clock, however,
the vessel sank. The greater part
of the crew were saved. An officer
and two first-class subofficers and
149 sailors are missing. Sixty-four
of the crew have since died from the
effects of burns.
"The position of the ship, which lies
in shallow water, gives hope that it
may be refloated and completely re
paired In a few months. The bridge is
only one yard below water level."

BILLY SUNDAY, IN BOSTON, SAYS
Women keep the ship of Zion off the
rocks.
Try praising your wife even if it
does scare her at first.
Happiness is better for wrinkles
than powder rags.
Too many rosewood coffins are
bought with money that ought to have
been spent for a hired girl.
When you drive the saloon into hell.
you'll do away with crime.
The man that knocks the Gospel Is
low down I wouldn't spit upon him.
Treat your wife after you're mar
ried fifty years as you did when court
ing her.
There is many a fellow trying to
work some shell game on God today.
You never see a Jew among tho
hoboes, panhandling and mooching
you for a handout. You seldom hear
of a Jew committing a crime.
God will not hear the rich man be
cause he is rich; neither will he re
fuse.
Red whiskey and the church have
nothing in common.
Graft has got the strangle hold on
religion and the church. It has gag
ged and bound the church.
So-called gentlemen and ladies rent
their property to dive keepers and
ruin men. They are no more to be re
spected than the unfortunate prosti
tute. Judging from the church attend
ance today. Heaven won't be packed
with men.
i m t
If Boston had had to wait for cer
tain members of the churches the old
town would have been in hell long
ago.
Some people think they can't run a
church without oyster Boup. The
more soup there is the faster the
church is going to the devil.
I don't care whether they have a
Prince Albert or whether their col
lar's buttoned In the back or not, just
so they get to Him.
There are lots of preachers who
don't know Jesus. They know about
Him, but they don't know HIni.
There is too much playing hide-and-seek
and tng with the devil in the
churches.
You can pray till you are black In
the face and bald-headed, but you're
wasting your time unless you agree
with God.
What the church needs today is a
baptism of horse seiiBe.

I
Record Number Responded to Ap
peals of Evangelist
MEETING WAS FOR MEN ONLY
Sunday Assailed the Liquor Interests
and Says That He Plans to Make
Boston Cry,
Boston, Nov. 23. Billy Sunday start
ed the trail hitters tonight, breaking
all other first nights for converts in
the history of his religious revivals.
Just 1440 people in the tabernacle re
sponded when after a windup of re
markable oratory the baseball evan
gelist called lor trail hitters. To
night's service was for men only, and
the evangelist took advantage of the
opportunity presented. He assailed
the booze interests and reiterated his
statement of last night, when he said
he would make Boston a dry city.
His sermon this evening was taken
from the text II Chronicles xviii: 15.
"As tho Lord liveth, even what my
God saith, that will I speak,"
Mr. Sunday said In part:
"Micaiah was a man whose ser
mons were not written on the head
of a flour barrel; the condition of his
cellar had nothing to do with his liber
ty in the pulpit. His theology and
nantry were not dependent on each
other. He was afraid of being canned
by taking dead aim at some influential
sinner on the front seat. A patch in
his coat did not make him think he
had no call to preach.
"He did not lose sy sleep because
his preaching was not popular with
a certain crowd. He did not throw
up the sponge because all-star
preachers knocked him.
"Let a preacher get in the pulptt
and tear the mask from the devil's
face and the congregation is shocked.
At the mention of hellflrq'and brim
stone, they have hysterics. A ser
mon by a man filled with the Holy
Ghost bores them to death. They
see nothing in it. It is hard for them
to keep awake.
"The kind of a preacher they want
is one who will allow them to serve
the devil all week, then go to church
on Sunday without losing any self-
respect. They do not mind heariug
about the sins of Europe, but they
want nothing said about the sins of
tho United States.
"They will agree with the preacher
who proves there is a devil in the
slums, but disagree with a man who
proves there Is a devil on the boule
vard. They will agree with the man
who says there is a devil in the red
light district, but will crucify the fel
low who proves there Is a devil In
the drawing room. They will agree
with the preacher who knocks the sa
loon, but it will rail againft tho man
if he tells them they are running a
booze Joint in their own home.
"Somehow. Jehosaphat could not
lead himself to believe in the proph
ecy of Micaiah. He faced about on
the throne that he could look Ahab
In the eye and asked, is there not
here a prophet of the Lord.'
"Ahab said, 'Yes. a fellow I forgot.
Eccentric creature who robs his
family of their bread and butter
every time ho opens his mouth to
preach. A man, lacking in discrimi
nation anil correct judgment. A
prophet of ability 1 admit, but lie is a
fanatic. Nothing his talent, I took In
terest in him and would have ad
vanced him to a gcod appointment
with good pay as spiritual advisor of
the court, but to my chagrin found
that in his preaching he had no more
legard for the feelings of royalty than
a steel trap.
" 'I had to change my preacher or
stop going to church. He never
phophesled any good for me in all his
life. And in order that brotherly
love might prevail! and someone high
ly connected might not take offenso
and withdraw his fiupjHirt I decided
to have this obstinately eccentric and
fanatic preacher locked up in other
words, canned! But to show you to
what absurd extremities religious' hot
headedness can go I will have this
unfortunately dogmatic preacher
brought out. Then you will see he
never looks to see who Is in the
church before he preaches.'
"And, summoning an officer to ap
pear, Ahab said: 'Fetch me quickly,
Micaiah, son of Imla.'
"Micaiah said that tho troops
should not bo sent In the field but
be sent home in peace. Ahab warned
him to tell nothing but the truth. It
was not tho truth that Ahab wanted.
He wanted tho prophot say that ho
would have It all his way. No rebel
against God wants the truth. All he
wants Is all high authority for living
in sin without being brought to judg
ment. "Tho reason why some people hate
the Bible is because it tells them if
they live as they want to. God has
determined that they will suffer.

LOW PRIGEO flDVEBTISlNS
FOODjUPPlY
President Wilson Said to Have Giv
en His Consent
MEASURE IS NOT RETALIATORY
Will Not Be Directed Toward Any
Foreign Country But To Lower
Cost of Living in U. S.
Washington, Nov. 23. Information
was obtained today that the Admin
istratlon, in an effort to redeem In
some measure the promise for a lower
cost of living made four years afo, ac
tually Is behind the proposal for an
embargo on foodstuffs.
There has been reluctance in ad
ministration circles to take a step
which might bo misinterpeted by the
countries at war, but it is understood
that administration officials felt bound
to support the embargo since the cost
of the necessities of life, instead of de
dining, has mounted rapidly to a level
at which many articles of food can be
bought only by those who are more
than well to do.
For this reason Representative Fitz
gerald of New York is secure in the
knowledge that he will have at least
silent approval from the executive and
of the avenue when he places his pro
posal for an embargo before Congress.
That tho State Department does not
desire the impression to go abroad
that the measure is in any degree in
tentionally retaliatory was indicated
today by a statement of Secretary
Lansing, in which he said he consider
ed the question purely a domestic one
and one in which the State Depart
ment had no concern.
Why Hughes Lost California.
An esteemed Michigan subscriber
writes us, blaming tbe result of the
election on Hushes. He also encloses
a copy of the Detroit Journal, giving
prominent place to an article from the
staff correspondent of tho United
Press, giving facts regarding the elec
tion in California, where Hughes lost
by about 3,000 and the state elected
Gov. Johnson. Senator, by over 300,
000. The facts are as stated, we judge,
from all that we have read.
The conclusions are wrong, we
think.
Anyone who has campaigned with
a great speaker, who knows some
thing of how a speaking tour is con
ducted, would not blame Mr. Hughes
for the snub given Gov. Johnson in
his own state, a slight that was re
sented by fair minded men of all par
ties, who were proud of their gover
nor and jealous of the dignity that at
taches to that office in the golden gate
state.
When Roosevelt toured Vermont
four years ago, he was speaking from
six to ten times a day, during the
three days he was in the state. It
took all his tremendous vitality to
stand up under the strain. He had
no time to meet or think of anything
or anybody. Those he met were
those whom the Progressive party
leaders introduced to him, Every
other moment was spent in resting,
etc.
This is exactly what probably hap
pened in California when Hughes
made his very short trip through that
state. The chairman of tho Califor
nia and National republican commit
tees had, jointly, charge of the speak
ing arrangements and Mr. Hughes
had no opportunity to meet anyone
except those whom these gentlemen
wanted him to meet. They were bit
terly opposed to Gov. Johnson. Like
Mr. Roosevelt in Vermont, Mr. Hughes
undoubtedly knew nothing of the situ
ation in California till too late.
The blame lies wholly with those
hldcblund, reactionary stand-patters,
Chester H. Rowell, Francis Kecsling
and W. H. Crocker, who tried to vent
their spito upon Gov. Johnson, and
cost the republicans the presidency.
Tho United Press man says that
when Hughes was leaving the state
he was given the other side of the
case, and immediately sent a trusted
friend to see Gov. Johnson and ex
plain the situation. That the latter
knew Hughes was net to blame was
evidenced by the effort he made to
carry tho state for Hughes, but the
poison was spread so thoroughly
through the blood of loyal Califor
nians, who resented the insult, to the
governor cf their state, that it could
not be eradicated by even Gov.
Johnson.
These are the facts, we believe.
Spito cost the republicans the presi
dency. Blaine lost New York by a foolish
friend, Hughes lost California and the
Presidency, by worse than foolish
friends. Morrisville Messenger.

DEER POACHERS IN DANBY
Section of Town Being Watched By
Came Wardens.
That Rutland county is tho home of
a chain of camps populated by "game
hogs" or fish and game outlaws" Is
the belief of the officials of the state
and county and many of the residents
of the town of Danov. the infested
section being on the mountain ranges
east of the village of Danby. A few
days ago County Game Warden F. W,
Hayward of Rutland and County War
den Edward S. Higgins of Bennington
were in the vicinity all day but they
did not find sufficient evidence to
make arrests.
The authorities have been trying to
clean up the situation for several
months and it is probable that the
state fish and game department in the
near future will employ men not
known to the campers to gather evl
deuce. There are camps along the
top of the mountain where dogs are
kept and this is Rtrictly against the
law. Deer have been taken out of
season and trout are taken during the
closed seasons, it is alleged, by tho
men of the woods.
Warden Higgins, who was in Rut
land Saturday, complains of the state
laws which do not prevent a man
carrying a revolver. He says many
foreigners and hunters from without
the state take advantage of this situa
tion by hunting with revolvers and
thus escape paying a non-resident li
cense, or any license at all, for that
matter.
Early last week the authorities were
notified that two good-sized deer had
been shipped out of a camp in Danby
by way of an automobile and that both
of the animals were shot before the
opening of the season. An' investiga
tion followed and on Saturday Frank
Baker of Danby, a fern picker, was
arrested and brought to Rutland.
State's Attorney C. V. Poulin and
the two game wardens interrogated
the man but he did not disclose any
evidence which would tend to convict
himself or anyone else. He claimed
his machine had been broken for sev
eral days. Tho man wa3 arraigned be
fore Judge F. G. Swinnerton and the
case against him of transporting deer
contrary to law was nol prossed.
Tho situation in Danby has been
reported to State Commissioner John
W. Titcomb. who is giving the matter
his personal attention. The commis
sioner says it is an extremely hard
matter to get the necessary evidence,
although the officials are satisfied as
to the identity or some .of, the law
breakers.

HAD DOGS IN WOODS
Two Readsboro Men Each Fined $100
and Costs.
County Game Warden E. S. Higgins
was in Readsboro Thursday to con
duct the prosecutions of Partire Bar-
tisto and Eugene Bartisto of that
town whom he arrested for a viola
tion of that section of the fish and
gamo lawB which prohibits the taking
of hound dogs into the woods during
the open deer season. Both pleaded
guilty before Justice M. O. Hicks and
were each fined $100 with costs of

ROUMANIANS WILL
ALT VALLEY
Have lost 10,000 Square Miles
of Territory in Few Days
WESTERN ARMY PROBABLY TAKEN
New Line of Defence Is 90 Miles West
of Bucherest and Accessible For
Reinforcements.
London, Nov. 23. Ten thousand
square miles, nearly half of western
Rumania, have been yielded to the in
vading Teutons by the Rumanian
army which lost Craiova. The Ru
manians have retreated to the Alt Val
ley, ninety miles west of Bucharest,
where they plan to make a stand.
This is the opinion here In the light
of an official statement Issued today
by the Rumanian War Office, its first
official word since Sunday. It is be
lieved this statement spells the aban
doning of the Rumanian army at Or
sova, in Hungary, to Its fate. This
army appears to be surrounded.
Rumania thus relinquishes, because
of von Falkenhayn's successful and
rapid strategy, a part of the rich grain
conntry of the Wallachlan plain. A
good share of this country, -however,
is still protected by the Alt and the
new Rumanian line.
As the Rumanian official statement
is read here it means that the Ruman
ians have retreated east along the
front for a distance of from twenty
five to forty miles. This retirement
has been made along a front of ap
proximately a hundred miles, It is be
lieved. The Teutonic allies in the Wallach
ian province are keeping up their ad
vance against the Rumanians.- The
operations there, according to the lat
est German official communication,
are "progressing In accordance with
our plans." Semiofficial advices from
Eerlin arc to the effect that Gen von
Fallkenhayn's army up to Tuesday
had 11,000 square kilometers of wheat
soil in Wallachia and, with the cap
ture of the railroad had shut off com
municatiou of all the Rumanian troops
west of Craiova.
Except in Macedonia little fighting
of moment is taking place. Here, in
