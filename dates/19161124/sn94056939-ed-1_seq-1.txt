of HELPS HASTEN FINAL
DECISION IN MATTER
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 22
Thc Adamson eight-hour law
was hold unconstitutional here
today by Judge William C. Hook
in United States district court.
Judge Hook directed the
receivers of tho Missouri, Okla
homa and Gulf railroad, which
brought the original action in
this case, to enjoin the law from
going into effect, to assist the
government in expediting the
case to the supreme court of the
supreme court of tho United
States for final decision and in
structed thorn, through their
attorneys, to invito tho represent
atives of every railroad in this
country to participate in tho
hearings before th" highest court
in the land. This va3 requested
in tho goverment'a motion to
dismiss the injunction petition of
the railroad, tho government
desiring, to avoid "prolonged,
unnecessary and scattered litiga
tion" through the hearing of
countless similar suits filed by
everv railroad system in every
federal district in the United
States through which their lines
run. It is expected that the ulti
mate decision as to whether tho
law will go into effect Jannary 1
will be handed down before that
time. A transcript of tho pres
ent case will bo filed at tho su
preme court before it reconvenes
December 4.
Neither the attorneys for many
large railroad systems, who were
present in court, nor tho govern
ment counsel present, would
comment on thn decree. Appar
ently both sides regarded tho
caso only as a means of hasten
ing a decision by tho supremo
court which is the final arbiter.
Tho text of Judge Hook's dc-
crco follows:
"This is an independent suit
ti onloin the inforcement of a
recent act of congress, commonly
called the Adamson law, ujxm
the ground that it is contrary to
tho constitution. In the plaintiff's
bill of comnluint is stated to bo
typical of a number recently filed
by railroad companies in various
district courts of tho United
States. A motion to dismiss has
bauii presented on behalf of
the defendant United Stales
attorney. Tho boIo question
raised by it is that of tho consti
tutionality of tho law. The
court is informed that tho other
cases stand on applications for
temporary injunctions.
An appeal from an organ
granting or refusing a témpora
ry injunction goes to tho circuit
court of appeals and not further
by ordinary proccedurc, while an
appeal from a final order or de
cree in such caso would go di
rectly to the supreme court of
tho United States.
"The former decision would bo
inconclusive, tho latter decision
would settle definitely tho ques
tion for tho whole country. Tho
motion to dismiss tho caso here,
however, it is decided, will re
sult promptly in a final decrco
from which an appeal will bo
taken to tho supremo court.
The assistance of this court
has been invoked to facilitate a
final and authoritivo determina
tion of tho constitutional ques
tion. Tho caso was present
ed hut yesterday and a decision
is duo today. It in far from be
ing an agreeable duty for a judge
to record a judicial conclusion
without tho care and dclibara
tion o33cntial to a conviction that
ho would stand to in every cir
cumstance. Upon tho merits of
a case the government neither
asks nor receives from a court
greater consideration than íb re
quired by the settled rules and
presumptions of law; but a re
quest by tho department of jus-
tico to aid the progress of a case
consistently with tho rights of
every ono cannot uc declined,
certainly not for personal con
siderations.
Upon a consideration of tho
Adamson law and of what is
said of its practical effect and
what was intended to be accom
plished by it, the judgment is
that as tho court construes the
terms oi t h e law, i t cannot
bo sustained.
"Since both parties have said
they would not plead further,
whatever tho decision might be,
a decree will be entered for tho
plaintiff, reciting that tho def
endant prays and is allowed an
appeal in open court. Tho case
In which tne plaintms wcro ap
pointed receivers is in charge of
the judge who is acting here.
An order will bo entered in that
case directing plaintiffs and their
council to co-operate with the
department of justice in lodging
tho appeal in the supremo court
by December 4 next and in then
moving for the advancement
thereof for such early hearing us
that court may find it consistant
to grant; also to invito counsel
for all railroad companies and
others similarly interested in the
question involved to participate
in the presentation of tho motion
to advauco and in tho arguments
on tho mérito. Though the de
cree of the court in tho case here
will be final in form, yet because
of theoxcoptional circumstances,
the plaintiffs will be directed to
keep their accounts and ho pre
pared promptly to pay their em
ployes on the basis of the Adam
son law should tho decrco bo not
sustained."

STATE WIDE MAY
BE HEREJN SPRING
Probable That Prohibition
Issue Will be Brought
to Light.
LEGISLATIVE BODY
TO CONSIDER ACT
Tho resolution to submit the
question of sUitcwide prohibitioi
to tho voters next year will be
tho first to bo introduced at the
legislativo session, if present
pluns arc succáteful. Prohibition
ists feel that tho pledge of both
parties to submit the question
will he kept, especially since E.
C. d Haca, elected governor,
a pronounced prohibitionist, m
is also W. E. Lindsey, who, vm
lieutenant governor, will preside
over the state senate and will act
us governor whenever E. C. d
Bact is out of tho utale. In fact
prohibitionists assort that they
threw several thousand votes t
both men and elected thorn be
cause of their unequivocal stand
for prohibition.
They assort further that it wi
this factor which re-elected
Chief Justico Clarenco J. Rob
erts, J. H. Wagner, elected su
perintendent of public instruc
tion, is ulso a prohibitionist
Tho fact that Antonio Lucero
ran so far ahead of his ticket is
ascribed to tho samo influence ac
is the close raco that Attorney
Patton gave such a popular vet
eran as Frank W. Clancy for the
attorney generalship. Wherever
a pronounced prommtionlst on
tho state ticket, tho former won.
At the samo timo that tho pro
hibition question is submitted
to tho voters, tho woman's buí
fragc amendment to the consti
tution, pledged by both parties,
will also bo submitted, but be
cause of the difficulty of amend
ing the franchise section of the
state constitution, will hardly
succeed at tho polls. Clovis
