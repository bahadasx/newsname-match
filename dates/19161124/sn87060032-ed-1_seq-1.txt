BARBOURVILLE
HI(?:f SCHOOL NEWS

Miss Barton's room has caught
the banner spirit, as a few weeks
ago they were at the end of list,
but finally encouraged by receiv
ing it last week, they found' It
easier to obtain this week. Who
will have it next?
Last Monday afternoon a game
of basketball was played between
the High School Boys' team and
the Union College boys' team.
The score was 27 to 16 in favor

Affirms Bid Damage Suit
In June. 1913. Edward Parker,
the son of Nathan Parker, was
killed on his engine in the yards
at Middlesboro while working for
the Louisville & Nashville Rail
road Company. Soon after his
death Nathan Parker, as admin
istrator of Edward Parker, thru
his attorney. J. M. Robsion, filed
suit in the Knox Circuit Court
for damages. The case was tried
before Judee Sampson and a ver
dict was awarded the plaintiff for
$7,000.00. The railroad company
carried the case to the Court of
Appeals of Kentucky which court
affirmed the judgment of the
Knox Circuit Court. The rail
road company then appealed the
case to the Supreme Court of the
United States and a few days ago
tnis court, the highest in the na
tion, affirmed the judgment of
the Knox Circuit Court and the
Kentucky Court of Appeals.,
We understand that this is the
first case that ever went from
the Knox Circuit Court to the
Sunreme Court of the United
States. It was one of the hard
est fought cases ever tried in the
state.
The judgment now amounts to
nearly $10,000.00

Charley Randalls
Convicted
Last Wednesday morning the
jury in the case of the Common
wealth against Charley Randalls,
who was on trial for the murder
of Bessie Holt, brought in a Ver
dict of guilty and fixed his pun
ishment at confinement in the
State penitentiary for life.
Mr. Randalls was represented
by Sawyer A.. Smith and RV N.
Jarvis, while the prosecution was
represented by .1. B. Snyder and
J. F. Catron.
Messrs. Smith and Jarvis made
a noble fight for their client and
we believe they did all that could
have been done by any one and
much more than could have been
done by many others who prac
tice law. In fact, there are, no
better lawyers to be found than
these two gentlemen, yet the
jury brought in a verdict for wil
ful murder. It is said the case
will go to the Court of Appeals.
No Contest I
There has been some newspa
per mention that Judge Koberson,
of Pikeville, would likely contest
the election ot . Judge iampson
as Judge of the Kentucky Court
of Appeals from this district.
But, the Advocate is not prepared
to believe this, because it seems
so ridiculous and unreasonable:
In the first place, the only
question which Judge Roberson
could raise is the same one tried
out in the Kirk contest, and the
Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the Circuit Court,
declaring Judge Sampson nomi
nee of the party. The judgment
in the Knox Circuit Court in that
case is written out in full on the
order books and signed by the
trial Judge, and tht Court of
Appeals affirmed this judgment
and so says the opinions in the
books.
In the general election there is
no charge of any wrong doing so
far as Judge Sampson is concern
ed, and could be none. There is
no claim he did not file a state
ment of expense and there is no
other technical question raised.
He was elected by about seven
teen thousand majority, which is
considerable more majority than
the head of the Republican ticket
received in the same counties,
and the largest majority ever re
ceived by a Republican in this
distric. In other words, he ran
ahead of his ticket. He carried
Judge Roberson's county by a
large majority. ihere is no
doubt that Judge Sampson is the
choice of the people, and we do
not believe any reputable lawyer
who aspires to the office of Judge
of the Kentucky Court of Appeals
would contest an election upon
such, narrow and flimsy grounds.
Out information is that Judge
Roberson is a good'lawyer and a
man of good standing in his com
munity, and we do not believe
that he can afford to. or that he
will enter a contest in this case
where where he knows it would
be hopeless and where he has
been so overwhelmingly defeated
at the polls. This should not be
done, and we hope it will not be
done.
Good Farm For Sale
I have a good farm for sale,
about 40 acres, a fine bunch of
timber, good orchard, and one
oil well, with oil in paying quanti
ties. Located about 2 1-2 miles
from Barbourville, Ky., close to
church dnd school. For particu
lars, call or write Mrs. Mary

James S. Golden.
After the smoke of the late po
litical battle has cleared away
and we take inventory of our
forces, and review the conduct
of our leaders and fighters, both
old and young, we feel that we
can congratulate Knox County
on the number of her sons who
went into the fray and fought
with manly vigor to restore our
country to the Republican stand
ard. Among the many worthy young
men of our county who engaged
in this fight we predict that none
will mount the ladder of fame
quicker or bring more honor to
his native county, than James S.
Golden, son of Capt. B,B. Golden.
Young Mr. Golden, who is now
only 25 years of age, has already
established himself before the
people of this county as a stal
wart Republican and active work
er, and one of no mean ability in
our late campaign.
Mr. Golden was born in this
county in 1891, graduated at the
Kentucky University in 1912, and
out of a class of 250 none stood
higher. After completing his
literary course he took a course
in law at the University of Mich
igan, at Ann Arbor, one of the
best law schools in the country,
and by his ability and untiring
efforts completed a three year
course in that school in two years,
and he is the onl person to accom
plished that in the long life of
the institution.
Keep your eye on this young
man with his ability and energy
he will be heard from in the great
battle for honors and fame in this
life.

NOAH DUNN
UWt Fourmile, Ky,
Dishman Flats Destroyed
bvFire
,!,"
Last Tuesday about
fire alarm was turned
was found that the old
Dishman I
Flats were ablaze and that it wasl
a fight to the finish if the re -
maindcr of the block was saved.
The fire started in the South
west corner of the building and
before the department could get
there the whole house appeared
to be in a flame, but the boys did
their full duty and within an
hour the fire was out.
The Flats were occupied by
Mr. and Mrs. R. M. Stansbury.
They lived in the upper part and
had one of the finest ladies' de
partment stores in the lower
part anywhere to be found. The
whole stock of goods was lost
and most part of the furniture
was either burned or damaged so
that it is practically worthless
l ne damage to the building is
total, as it will have to be re
moved. Judge Dishman did not
have any insurance on it at all.
The store of Mrs. Stansbury,
which was called "The Little
Shop" was a total loss. It is es
timated that the total loss is
$4,000.00 with $1,000.00 insur
ance. The household goods,
worth about $2,000.00 were par
tially covered by insurance.
There was quite a lot of other
goods stored in the building and
most part of it was removed, but
it was badly damaged in moving
and by water and smoke.
This was the most dangerous
fire that we have had for many
years and it may be justly said
that it was the young men of the
city who volunteered to fight the
flames that it was putunder con
trol as soon as it was. It looked
like the water was in better con
dition to fight the fire than usual
as there was no lack of pressure,
and the company had a large sup
ply in the reservoir and ready to
turn on the pumps if necessary.
Walter Cody, one of the nozzle
men, was overcome oy smone
and received several bruises, but
soon recovered.
Electrical Demonstration
Last Tuesday Mr. J. T. Noe,
representing H. G. Tafel & Co.,
of Louisville, gave a most inter
esting demonstration of electrical
appliances. Mr. Noe is an artist
at the business and showed the
public generally that it was easy
to get along if you have the elec
tric current.
He demonstrated how easy it
is to make coffee, bake biscuits,
fry eggs, cook roast, and in fact,
cook anything, no matter what,
from soup beans to the most del
icate kind of cooking. He did
not stop at that He showed how
to run the sewing machine, grind
coffee, rock the cradle, cnurn the
milk, beat the butter and, keen
the baby quiet. He could have
shown, if he would, how to kiss
by electricity. That is, he could
have shown, with a switch prop
erly arranged, how you could
kiss your sweetheart, your wife,
or some other man's wife, in the
dark when any one would swear
it did not happen for the light
was burning all the time.
The light company here will
handle all these accessaries all
the time and will be glad to show
you how easy it is to live within
your own means by using thest
olectrical utensils. They will
soon have continuous current for
domestic use and it will be. easy
for you to have a quick lunch at
any timo in the day or night and
you need not worry about the
price of coal nor wheter or not
tht gas is working,
