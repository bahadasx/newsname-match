According to all reports, the east
end of the county, the apple growers
in this section have been hard hit by
the sudden change in temperature and
the heavy frosts, during the last week
or ton days. A considerable part of
the crop had already been placed out
of danger, but there was a large
quantity of apples picked and ready
for packing in the orchards when the
weather changed and it is expected
that these will be unfit for shipment
now. . '
In the west end of the county tiie
damage to fruit will not be es great
because of the relatively smaller crop,
but many of the farmers who have
been planning on reaping large re
turns from their potato acreage this
year find It almost a total loss. The
frost has reached several inches into
the ground and many of the tubers
are frozen.
Yakima report that a sudden drop
in temperature has frozen 2$ carloads
of apples in the Yakimavalley. Thou
sands of boxes of apples, still on the
ground or standing in open packing
sheds, were badly frozen. There are
frozen apples in every part of the val
ley hut more in the Naches than in
any other section.
' In his anxiety to save his crop Sun
day night, Walter Arnold put a fire in
his packing shed that got beyond con
trol in the night, burning the shed and
its contents. The loss was 32500.

Dullards has changed its name to

its output will be increased to 200

Following a report of John W. Cun
ningham, a government agent sent to
investigate the demand for and prac
ticability of in-proved roads connect-"
ir.g Wallowa and Union counties with
UmaUla eounty and the Walla Walla
valley a movement that has been
encoursged in every possH.: way by
Walla Walla good roads men Uiose
who are deeply interested in the im
provement begin to see a ray of light
because bf the possibilities of state
and federal aid for these roads, says
the Walla Walla Union.
Inspector Cunningham went over
both the proposed routes one from
La Grande by way of meacnam to
Pendleton and the other way by way
of Elgin and Toll Gate to Milton
and reported to the District Forester
at Portland that the first road's rouie
was not a good one but that one would
prolaUy be worked out that could be
made feasible; while the second road.
the one in which local people are more
interested, is entirely feasible and
needed.
Mr. Cunningham advised the people
and the courts of. Union,: Umatilla
and Wallowa counties to concentrate
their efforts on one of the roads first
so fur as federal aid is concerned.
- It now eppears, however, that the
La Crande-Pend'.cton road will be
assisted by the state and the Elgin
Milton road by the government for
estry service, as this latter road Jles

prospects for the two roads is now
good and invites comments from other
