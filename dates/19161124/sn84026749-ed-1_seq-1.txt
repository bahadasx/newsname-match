U.S. PUZZLED
BY RUMORS ON
U-BOAT PLANS
Officials See Nothing to War
rant Reports of Crisis
With Germany.
MIQ'HT BE PEACE EFFORT
Passage of Dispatches by Cen
sors So Regarded by Some.
Stock Market Hints.
Responsible officials of tho Amerl
can Government aro unable to per
ceive In the present rumors that Qer
many Is on the point of throwlnr
overboard her pledge to the United
States concerning the conduct of sub
marine wnrfare.
What these rumors are based on, or
what the motives nro that lie back of
them are questions for which the
State Deportment can find no answer.
From an absolutely authentic source,
The Times learned today that the
State Department Is as much mystified
over tho reports as anybody else.
Uncertain as to Motive.
Whether the persons starting; the
rumors are In position to speak from
a more Intimate knowledge of Ger
many's Intentions than the State De
partment possesses; or whether the
rumors, which have originated for
the most- part In Wall Street, are put
out with the deliberate purpose of in.
fluenclng tho stock market, neither
we l'resiaeni nor any or nis uovisers
are ablo to say.
Thus far, It Is declared by officials
who speak with unquestionable au
thority, there Is absolutely nothlnit In
the situation as It stands at the pres
ent moment to warrant the belief that
a new crisis Is pending1.
Developments Possible.
It Is admitted, of course, that de
velopments may occur at any time
which might exposo a purpose on the
part of tho Kaiser's government to
forco an Issue with the United States.
On the surface, however. It Is de
clared, the Marina case Is the only
one of the recent series of subma
rine attacks which, at this time and
on the basis of Information obtained
by the State Department. Indicates
a violation of Germany's pledires.
And. even In this case, the State De
partment, it was stated, has no rea
son whatever to beluva that Ger
many will "not make full amends as
soon as the facta are presented fully
to the German foreign office.
Von Jbcjow's Hetlrenseat.
It Is stated that the State Depart
ment can see ho significance what
ever of a hostile character In the re
tirement of Count von Jagow from
the portfolio of foreign minister at
Berlin, and the substitution of Herr
Zimmerman.
On the contrary the American Gov
ernment has Invariably found the
latter friendly to the United States
and anxious to preserve the friendly
relations between the two countries.
There Is considerable doubt at the
department as to the possible sig
nificance of the pessimistic press re
ports which, predicting early com
plications between the two countries
over the submarine question, are per
mitted to pass the rigid German cen
sorship. , . .
The Interpretation placed by many
officials on this Is that Oermany
really Is seeking, by means of these
reports, to stir up further agitation
among the neutral countries ana
among the British shipping Interests
In favor of peace.
Maay Ileporta Unfounded.
Many of the reports which are find
ing circulation In Wall Street, Depart'
ment officials point out, are manifest
ly unfounded, particularly those
which persist In stating that the
American Government has determined
to hand Count von Bernstorff his pass
ports and thereby sever diplomatic re
lations as a result of the recent sub'
marine attacks. There Is nothing
whatever , It Is stated, to Justify such
a statement.
Many of these rumors have come to
the State Department, It was stated,
but not from official sources.
In German embassy circles today a
similar surprise was expresed over
the persistency of these pessimistic
predictions. Persons In close touch
with the German Ambassador Indi
cate that even If Germany were con
templating a return to the former
submarine practices, It Is not likely
that such aotton would be taken until
after the matter has been discussed In
the Oerman Reichstag, which will not
meet again until next April.

GRANGE FIGHTS
EMBARGO PLAN
i
Farmers' Organization Takes
Firm Stand Against Any Re
striction of Exports.
Embargoes on food products of any
descriptions will bo opposed with
all the strength of the Individual
members and affiliated organisations
of the National Grange of Patrons .
of Husbandry.
The Grange acted unanimously and '
with little debate upon a resolution
to this effect at the closing sessions
of Its annual convention at the I
Italelgh Hotel today. The Grange of-1
fleers, when asked regarding the
matter, stated that the resolution j
speaks for Itself. The farmers of the
country, they stated, areunequlvocally '
opposed to any restriction of the ex
ports of grain or other farm prod
ucts, and will fight the enactment
of such legislation as hard as they
can.
Dissatisfaction General.
"Everybody Is complaining of the
cost of living," said Senator Oatllnger
of New Hampshire, who has arrived
here for the session. "I hear com
plaints everywhere I go. There can
be no doubt it la a most serious sit
uation." Senator Qalllnger said he was aware
of the movement for an embargo on
foodstuffs. He did not know, however,
whether it would give the relief ex
pected or whether It was practicable.
"I question whether Con it ess would
Impose an embargo," he said. "You
know we tried that policy once and It
was not a success. It la possible It
would do some good In this instance. It
la quite clear there is going to be a
great deal of agitation In Congress this
winter because of the serious complaint
over the high cost of living."
Adoption of a resolution followed
several heated speeches all favoring
the embargo.
"The motto of the profiteers," shout
ed Delegate Joseph Cannon, of Now
York, ''seems to be, not 'America
First," but 'Starve America First!'"
A. V. of L. Wants Embargo.

Several Members Said to Have
Come Out Against Satur
day Recess Plan.
Vigorous opposition Is understood to
have developed at today's Cabinet
meeting against the movement to
grant Government employes a Satur
day half holiday the year around.
Although most of the Cabinet offi
cers have reported favorably on tho
proposal, several of them are said to
have Insisted at today's meeting that
Its operation, particularly In Govern
ment offlcess outside the District
would seriously embarrass the hand
ling of Federal business.
Practically the entire meeting was
devoted to a discussion of the propo
sition, but without any definite de
cision being reached.
Members declined to state which of
them had opposed It. Written re
ports favoring the proposal had pre
viously been received by the Presi
dent, It Is understood, from all the
members of the Cabinet with the ex
ception of PostmMst General Bur
leson and Secretaary of the Navy

have Indicated that his mind was still
open on the subject. ,

shared by the commission as now con
stituted. Mr. Darr was Informed that the

No statistics were available to show
the comparative prices In lr-34, and
today, but It la commonly believed
that they were lower In the former
year.
Average Balary Higher.
In 1877, the average salary here In
Government service was higher than
It Is today, an analysis of the fig
ures of appropriations for that year
revealed. By tho revised statutes of
1871, the following classes of clerk
ships were established: Fourth class,
$1,800 per year: third class, $1,000;
second class, $1,400; first class, $1,200.
There was also a grade of women
assistants, at $0O0, messengers, at
$U40, and laborers at $740.
There were no posts with the ser
vice, in the District of Columbia,
which paid as low as $340. Neither
were there any $600 employes. The
men who received $720 a year did
the same work aa the $06O and $040
men do today. The women clerks who
received $000 per year In 1N71 do the
same grade of work as those who
get $720 under present conditions.
There are higher positions today than
there were In 1STI. but these are com
paratively few, and are mostly occu
pied by experts. The chief Increase In
the number of government employes
In the District Is shown by statistics to
have been In the lower grades of ser
vice. More Cheaper Positions.
The appropriation bill for the current
year contained provisions for twenty
six copyists In the Land Office, each to
receive $720 per year. This grade of
work woyi not known In 1S54. The Patent
Office had fifty copyists at the same
rate; It also employed fourteen laborers
at l&M. and forty-two at IS40. On the
rolls of the office were forty messengers
getting M50 per year. These grades
were unknown In 1&54, or In 1871.
There are ten laborers In the office
of the chief clerk of the Treasury get
ting JiOO pr year. The total number
of Treasury employes In Washington
getting under 73) a year Is likely 20.
The present grades of clerk psy In
the departments are, per years: tl.SOO,
ti.coo. h.too, ii.joo. $1,000, $900. $mo. $;.
K00, $540. The employes at the $340 and
$720 wages, who In old days were un
skilled laborers, today are occupied at
clerical and stenographic work. "Mes
senger" as many of them aro listed,
means clerk or stenographer. It is au
thorltatlvly declared.
Clerk Goi at Least I.20O,
In 1634 no clerk, listed aa such, got
under $1,200 per year. Now clerks are
listed at $840. "The average pay In
Government service Is a great deal
less, both actually and proportionate
ly, now than forty years ugo," de
clared one who had been an "inplnye
of Uncle Sam's for the Inst thlityflvs
years. "I should s.iy there fn n ill f
ference of almost 10 per innt In the
absolute uverage--uun tho relative
difference. Is much more."

These classes have not changed
