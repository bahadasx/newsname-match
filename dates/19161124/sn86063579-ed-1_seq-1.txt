Still Longs for Sunshine Stats
In n letter received by the editor
this week from B. J. Sisco, who will
be remembered as the boostor man
ager of the Qrnphio's big publication
ii few years ugo, and who married one
of our Deming girls and took ber to
Del riot, he gave the chering infor
mnlion: "Ben and Bess are both
still Ntniiueh Deming Boosters," and
nil hunch fortune hns been smiling
upon t hem in the north, they expect
to return to the sunshine state.
In speaking of their babies he
says: "We have thirty million dollars
north of children. 1. Martha, 2.
James 3. B. J., Jr."
He inquires particularly after his
brother-in-law, Edgar Ilepp, and
want to know if he will make a real
sure-enough politician.
Ho Hiiyn that Billy Sunday had a
great deal to do with making Mich
ignn dry, nnd that he and Bess are
both glad that Wilson was elected,
although they are not giving any time

DEMING MEN ARE QUESTIONED
We are very sure that the funnels
of the Mimbrcs nllfy will take u
treat interest iu this hcnclit that will
j be theirs in a space of very hborl
: time ami the Graphic feels under ob
ligations ,, our bunkers and Mr. Me
('an for going to the expense.- of ul
1 ling I hi- important meeting and
obtaining so much direct informa
tion, at the sumo time, impressing up
on the federal loan hoard the great
importance of the ilevelopuicnt we are
carrying on iu this urctit vallev.
It is very easy to understniid. to
those who have visited the New Mex
ico National Guard at the camp two
and ii hall' miles this side of Colum
bus, that the hoys must be provided
with some sort of building as n rec
reation hull, and ,i place for gjiihcr-
mgs of soldiers.
Some lime ago Ci plain Vincent ami
others made an appeal to the gciu-r-oiis

was met with a ready rcspons,. hyj
miiiiy communities. .Severn I m.liwil- j

bullous with splendid results.
The Graphic suggested the matter

definite character has been done k.
further this most worthy object.
As winter is coining on. it will he
vitally important that the New Mex
ico regiment be fiu-ui-hctl suitable

day The uovernnic.il will furnish the
material at cost, the boys will o the
work, but it will lake from i-ll'OO to

remote from the border have contrib
