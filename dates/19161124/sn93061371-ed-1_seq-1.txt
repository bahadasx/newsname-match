co, In 1518.
Long before that
he hud been wor
shiped by Aztecs.
Luter, when his
religious! vogue
Was past, he Was
given place of
honor nt tho marriage banquet of a
klntf. So superior a viand w;us he con
(tittered when first Introduced to Ku
rope that In u "constitution" set forth
by Cruniuer In 1514 turkey Is nnmed
lis one of tho greater fowls, of which
nil ecclcslawtlc was to "have but one
In a tlishe." But he speedily multi
plied to such an extent that no later
than 1555 two turkeys and four tur
key chicks were served at n feast of
the sergeants-iit-arius In London.
Turkeys nt that period were men
tioned In connection with cranes and
swans as Important and rich Items of
a banquet. A little later, lt 1573, tur
key were used on the tables of Kng
llsh husbandmen for the Christmas
feast. In the meantime they wert
more than plentiful In their home land,
where turkey con I limed to sell for
about six cents apiece as late ns, the
nineteenth century. For six cents In
those good old days a turkey weighing
about 12 pounds could be bought by
a good shopper. If the family need
ed a turkey weighing 25 or !I0 pounds
It was necessary to pay as much as u
quarter. But It must be remembered
that six cents in those days counted a
good deal more than it does In this.
Turkeys of Various Kinds.
The turkey that the Aztecs wor
shiped was probably either the Mexl-
can wild turkey, which Is known by
the white touches on its tall coverts
and quills, or, more appropriately, the
oeelluted turkey of Honduras and
rithet- parts of p (South America, .whose,
brilliant pitmhige, sjffitieVl almost' as
gloriously with vivid colors as a pea
cock, somehow allies it particularly
with that vivid early people. The tur
key which strolled out of the forests
of New England and furnished so ni(nr
velous a banquet for our Puritan fore
fathers was n handsomer bird than
that of Mexico, In the opinion of some
lovers of beauty, but not so brilliant
a one ns the Honduras turkey.
The American wild turkey, which
rViltly htittirigS ttt Thanksgiving, was
the North AhleHerin wild turkey
found throughout the eastern United
States and Canada. Scientifically It Is
known as the Meleagrls Americana.
Its plumage is black, shaded with
bronze. Iu the rays of the sun the
bl I'd gleams in a beautiful harmony of
black coppef, gold and bronze. And the
turkey likes the fays of the sun. He
hates damp weather, not alone because
it Is bat) for his health, but because
It obscures his beauty,
I. Is generally believed at present
that all the turkeys of tiio world havw
descended from the three forms knowr'
as the North American bird, which hat
Just been described; the Mexican bird
and the ocellated bird.
Credit May Belong to Spaniards.
The turkey which wns lirst intro
duced Into Europe may have been cur
lied there by the Spaniards from Mex
ico or the Jesuits may have taken It
buck across tho waters from one of
their scattered stations In the great
woods of Canada. In any event, one
of Its representatives figured at the
marriage banquet of Charles IX and
was regarded as of sufficient Impor
tance to be mentioned in the reports
of that festivity.
The Mexican turkey is the wild bird
of Mexico, which ulso came over the
line Into the southern part of ,the
United States. Meleagrls Gallopuva
Is the name that Is generally employed
to describe tills turkey. It Is some
what shorter in the shank than the
non hern species. Its body color Is
a metallic black, shaded with bronze.
This is thought to be the species that
the early navigators llrst bore back
to Spain ami England. The white tips
of Its plumage ulso have suggested
that It is to this bird rather than to
the wild turkey of North America
that most of tho domestic fowls owe
their origin.
Tho ocellated turkey, Meleagrls Ocel
Iata, which is smaller than tho oth
ers, has it bare head find neck. Its
hotly plumage Is bronze iihd green,
bunded with gold bronze and va-led
with spots of eyes of brilliant colors
blue, red und brilliant black.
THANKSGIVING
The cornfields sr ripe ifitf if tppUt are r4
Full are the btrn and the bin ;
The heYd n the prairies .'. numberless head
The harvest is now fathered in
The forest paid tribute the shoe) lVf mine
Have gladdened the grateful heart;
The looms have b' en clacking, the weaving Is fine.
And voices ..re loud in the mart.
The children .ire laughing and running to tdiool
Everywhere I Spirit call.
Fair Scioto li straining to viden her rule.
The earfh, (a and air enthrall.
A moment a silertfe . rapturous fhrill
Let's give CX sSanltsgivinl to Cod,
For all these good gifts of htt tMnteous wiO
r Are poured on America's sod
The people in answer responsive arise,
Each heart is now turned to a shrine;
The old hymn! WswU sing themselves out to the
skies.
And lips to the old prayers Incline,
But the old songs fall short; lougoes falter and
halt.
The music Is Just off the key.
The harvest is wondrous, so where is die fault
What lacks in our jubilee?
Then the fsul breaks forth of that worshiping host
In Te Deum thai shall not case,
"We thank thee. Lord, for the htrVMM rich, bus
most
For our harvest of peace."

Why la Turkey So Named
Why the turkey Iir called the tur
key when Its origin is admittedly pure
ly occidental is a subject that lut puz
zled uiuny persons. There are setcrttl
reasons glVen by those who huve
delved deeply Into this problem, and
one is privileged to take his choice,
Iu the first place, it is stated that the
turkey was originally supposed to
have come from Asia, Thus at a
time when d great stretch of territory
on the Aslutlc continent was culled
"Turkey" the bird derived Its name
from Its supposed origin. Another
speculative chronicler records that the
Indians called the' bird "flrkee" and
that from this its common nume wns
created. Then, again, It is somewhat
generally believed that the bird named
Itself by its pecttllur utterances, which
are still translated as "turk-turk-turkee."
Again, still more subtle philos
ophers have traced the naming of
the bird to its kinship In the matter
of polygamous habits with the Turks,
and there are other explanations.
The pilgrims were not so bad off
In some ways ns we have been led to
Imagine, for although they were de
prived of the Joys of tinned meats and
vegetables and cold storage and sim
ilar blessings turkeys were so plenti
ful that It is recorded it was custom
ury to refer to them as bread. An
other chronicler sets forth the fact
that the breast of the wild turkey
when cooked In butter was esteemed
by even the epicures among the ex
plorers. But in spite of their abun
dance turkeys were regarded with fa
vor even by the red men, if one is to
Judge by the following prayer which
they uttered:
"Oh great Being, I thank thee that
I have obtained the use of my legs
again so tbut I am able to walk about
and kill turkeys."
Choose Thankfulness,
Thankfulness Is not the inevitable
result of certain conditions, but a mat
ter ot deliberate choice. It Is a mis
take to tell ourselve that we should
be thankful If we possessed this or
that, for possession has little or noth
ing to do with thankfulness.
Be thankful. Do not waste any
time arguing whether or not you huve
any reason for It. Lift your heart to
tho Futher of us all in reverent grati
tude, and in the mere act of thankful
ness you will realize your blessings as
never before. .. .
cause It would bring turkey and "trim--'
miiigs" to every man aboard ship In
the navy. But now well, the suilor
meu are not any less patriotic, only
they have such Improved food condi
tions that a holiday has lost some of
its desirabilities, at least from 8 cu
linary standpoint.
In every other respect Thanksglv-'
Ing day is Just as longingly antici
pated, for greuter freedom Is allowed
the men, and events, unheard of In the
"old days," enliven the ship during
the forenoon und after dinner and tea
or tiffin.
All sorts of athletic contest possi
ble to the floating gymnasium ore In
dulged In and more than one promise
Ing "White flope" has made his debut
at a holiday bout.
From the time they turn out every
man aboard feels a tangible difference
In the day. No matter what th
weather conditions Whether they be
nenr the equator or plowing ubout Ice
crtts'ted seas It is Thnnksglvlng day
and there will be "doings."
Every vessel of the navy must be
kept shipshape and for this purpose
ubout a fourth of the men are told
off to look after the nbsolutey neces
sary routine, such us cleuning, scnuV
blnff, cooking and accomplishing thtr
thousand and one odd Jobs a man-of-war
is always providing.
Whenever It Is possible mpn ore per
mitted to go home for Thanksgiv
ing, und of course their "Day" be
comes ail individual holiday, but the
majority simply go ashore for a Jollitt
cntion, a theater or n footbnll game
if the fleet is In any home port or
for whatever happens to be provided
by "the natives" of u foreign port at
that time.
Of course the elaborateness of the'
day's! etcises depends upon the tal
ent of the err and tlie ai::e of the
ship. Athletic rivalry iff often intense
among various vessels of the fleet, and
v!lln one possesses tin ewjieclully
clever boxer, or fox trotter, or pie eat
er, or-singer,- the -others -are. sure to .
learn it there Is no hiding of lights
under bushels at such times and his
ability lends added luster to the program.
Thanksgiving Day Window.
Itunnuh More says of prnle that It
is the only employment In which self
bus no part. Surely on one day in the
year, If no more, the Lord of harvest
and tho nation's God should be re
membered. Like the (impel In a hos
pice on Mount Sinai, in which Is one
window so located that the sun shines
through It only on a single day in ev
ery year, so on Thanksgiving day, at
least, light enough should ruy Into ev
ery soul to show how good God I.
And this should ttwuken prulse, as the
kiss ol u sunbeam Is said to have smit
ten into music the chords of a lyre
in the temple of Memnon. Never
wns God better to us than now. It
Is a good time to be alive. A brim
ming cup Is ours. Whether we think
of our territorial possessions, of our
material prosperity, or of our civil and
religious blessings, the national thanks
giving ought to be volcanic a very
Vesuvius for its . Are and a very
Niagara for Its flow.
Creek Indians' Thanksgiving.
Among the Creek Indians of Okla
homa the New Year begins with the
"Busk," which Is a celebration corre
sponding to our Thanksgiving, except
that they celebrate the ripening of the
corn, and not its harvesting. Yet the
Idea Is exactly the same one of giving
thanks. By early writers It wus called
the "green corn dance," and was re
garded us n time of general forgive
ness, of absolution of all crime ami a
doing uwtiy with any feeling of hatred
towurd others.
