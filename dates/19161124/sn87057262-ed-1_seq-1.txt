VIENNA, (via Berlin) Nov. 24.—In

ruled Austro-Hungary, the body ot
Emperor Franz Josef lay In state to
day. His hands clasped a sliver and
pearl rosary which the dead mfcarch
had always used during his lifetime./
At each corner of the casket were
great candles, while his favorite flow
ers, HUies of the valley and violets
were massed on either side of the bier.
Priests intoned constantly the vigils
of the dead.
The official cause of the emperor's
death was announced today as perit
onitis and paralysis of the heart.
Just before}

Franz Josef received newe oi the Teu
tonic success in capturing Craiova, In
Rumania.
His last words, it is saifl, were *T •.

the Emperor Charles will make a few
changes in the government stafT, the
main one being replacement of Baron
Rurtan, now imperial privy counsellor
with Count Berchtold, who a year ago,
was detached from his place in the for
eign office and named master of the
imperial household, that he might tu
tor the heir in statesmanship and pre
pare him ?or the throne.
Arrangements for the funeral were
complete# today. The remains of the
late ruler will lie in the Grott gallery
or working room of the palace until
Monday niglit. At ten o'clock, the
body will be carried with the solemn
pomp of the ancient Hapsburg Spanish
ceremonial to the chapel of Hofburg
Augustiner. In this ancient structure
—more than 400 years old anT"one of
the finest specimens of medaeval archi
tecture in Europe—the body of the
late sovereign will rest until next
Thursday.
At 4:30 that afternoon the remains,
will be borne to the resting place of
the Hapsburgs—the ancient chapel of
the Capucines, where Franz Josef will
join in his last rest the 132 other Haps
burgs buried there.
Monday's funeral procession will in
clude every member of the imperial
household, every court officer, every
guard, every footman—in addition to
t~e new emperor and empress. The
latter two will receive the h,oly sacra
ment at the Hofburg chapel and then
the. lord steward of the imperial
household will shut the door until the
next morning. Then the public will
be permitted during Monday and Tues
dav to ta^e farewell of their beloved
ruler. Admittance to Schoenbrunn
palace is forbidden the populace, the
