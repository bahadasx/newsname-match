There have been 4,463 traffic accidents in Seattle since December 1, 1915.
Kittle girls, women and old men have been killed outright.
Dozens have been maimed for life.
Property damage rolling up into thousands of dollars has been the toll.
The total number of accidents has been checked at police headquarters
under the direction of Capt. Charles Sullivan, secretary of police. All manner of
injury to property and persons is included in the list. Some accidents, of course,
were never reported or recorded.
The situation has set officers to thinking of ways to prevent the loss to the
community.
