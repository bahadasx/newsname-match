The opening of the Tobacco Pair
and Corn Show ot the Liberty Ware
house on Commerce street yesterday
at noon marked the beginning of one
of the greatest attractions ever
brought to this city. All was in
teadiness for the opening at the ap
pointed hour and no display of the
products of Maysville and Mason
county every looked more attractive
than In the various tooths and on the
stands holding the competitive ex
hlbits. Practically every booth owner
in the building had all of his display
ready and there was no hurrying back
ward and forth during the afternoon
searching for material with which to
decorate booths.
A steady stream of entries kept
several men and women busy during
the entire forenoon and as a result a
large amount of corn, vegetables,
fruits, fancy work, pastry, etc., Is on
exhibition. There was not as much
tobacco as was expected by the man
agement as the fall has been very dry,
the farmers not being able to strip
the same. The corn exhibit is the
largest and to an inexperienced eye,
all of the entries have the same cTianoo
to win the prizes offered. In the
vegetable department a number of po
tatoes are shown, some being very
large. I'astry that would tempt an
epicure next confronts the visitor while
further along are the examples of
woman's handiwork.
The baby show will be held this af
ternoon at 3 o'clock. No previous en
try is necessary but at the appointed
time a call will be made for those
wishing to place their babies in com
petition. All babies up to the age of
IS months are eligable and a first prize
of SS.OO. will be offered for the finest
baby, $2.!i0 being a second prize.
Ample fire protection is given in the
building, the fire-fighting machine
