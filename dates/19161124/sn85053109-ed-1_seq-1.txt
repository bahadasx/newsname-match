Anderson Talks
Market Problems
Explains Workings of the
Equity Exchange
at St. Panl
John M. Anderson, of St.
Paul, one of the founders and
President of the Equity Co
operative Exchange of St. Paul,
delivered an address to local
members of the society at the
Electric Theatre, Tuesday after
noon.
Mr. Anderson, who is a force
ful and interesting speaker,
traced the humble rise of the
Equity, by a few tobacco grow
ers in Kentucky who had been
exploited for years by the to
bacco Trust and its develop
ment into a great cooperative
organization, extending its in
fluence and usefulness to the
agricultural regions of the north
west, where, today, it was em
ancipating the grain growers
from the thraldom of the old
time elevator and milling inter
ests.
The speaker told of the fight
made by the Minneapolis Cham
ber of Commerce to keep the
Equity out of the big grain
terminal, how the city of St.
Paul was chosen as the seat of
the Equity Cooperative Ex
change and declared that the
prospect for making this a sig
nal success was the brightest.
Equity elevators are now to be
found in all parts of the North
western grain belt and the St.
Faul Exchange is handling the
grain bought by these eleva
tors, as well as live stock and
other products.
Mr. Anderson gave the local
members some timely advice
as to how to manage their re
cently opened elevator. "Keep
your records in good shape,
don't expect to get all the
grain, even not all the grain of
those who are members of
your society. Don't worry and
you will win out—but don't
expect to win without doing a
little fighting."
Stock in the co-operative Ex
change was offered for sale at
the conclusion of the address
and a few shares were taken
by Cut Bank farmers.
Those in need of eye treat
ment should see Dr. Howe at
Cu t Bank Hotel, November 29.
Horses bought and sold at the

Big Screen Stuff
The biggest "screen stuff" that
patrons of the Electric Theatre
have ever seen was "The Battle
Cry of Peace," shown Wednes
day evening. The Battle Cry
of Peace is a stinging indict
ment of maudlin sentiment for
peace at any price and a power
ful sermon to support the doc
trine of preparedness as a guar
antee of permanent and honor
able peace. The destruction of
New York city by an enemy
fleet, aided by air engines, sub
marines and other death-dealing
devices, gave the audience
many thrills. A great many
Cut Bank people declared after
the show that they had been
suddenly brought to a realiza
tion of the dangers confronting
the United States, today the
least prepared of any of the na
tions. by witnessing this great
production.
Piatt Freed
V. M. Piatt, charged with
murder in the first degree for
the death of D. W. Bunday at
Bole on March 16. has been
found not guiltv by the jury
which heard the evidence at the
trial just concluded before Judge
J. B. Leslie in the district court
at Choi eau.
The killing of Bunday was
the result of a quarrel which
took place between him and
Piatt regarding some work in
connection with the erection of
a schoolhouse at Bole. The two
fought, and Bunday died as a
result of his injuries.
Piatt was arrested on a charge
of murder, but as the prosecu
tion was not ready for trial
when the matter c.me up l'ur
trial at the next term of court,
it was continued and Piatt was
released on bail.
The case came up at the pres
ent term of court and the hear
ing was commenced last Tues
day, with County Attorney
Green of Choteau and J. W.
Freeman of Great Falls prose
cuting. The defense was han
dled by J. W. Speer of Great
Falls and T. H. Pridham of Cho
teau. The evidence was con
eluded on Saturday, when the
arguments were commenced.
Attorney Speer concluded his
argument Saturday night and
the last argument for the state
was made Monday b y Mr.
Green. The case went to the
jury Monday at 11, and a ver
dict was returned about 4:30.
Jack London, America's best
known writer of virile fiction,
died at his California home on
Wednesday.

Pete Delre, Merchant Prince,
Has Business with Cupid—Now
On IjSadding Tour in Minnesota
um
Pete Delre, Cut Bank merchant
prince, stole quietly out of the busy marts
of trade here early this week. Pete's
mission out of the city was not a mission
of commerce—rather a business meeting
with Cupid, whose only stock in trade is
a bow and arrow, provided mythology
and the cartoonist have it "doped" right.
It has been an open secret for many
months that Pete was nurturing the ten
der passion. He did not neglect business
nor did he appear a bit "mooney," but
just the seme his friends, with fine intu
ition, kiiew that the longing' for domestication was possessing
him. \
But to the climax of the narrative. Pete journeyed to
Hastings, Minnesota, and one day this week, details are lacking,
he was united in marriage to Miss Agnes Geng. a very estimable
girl, who spent some time here last summer, visiting at the home
of her sister, Mrs. Tracy Poor. It was during her visit here that
the romance which culminated this week was begun.
Mr. and Mrs. Delre will arrive in Cut Bank the latter part of
the week, it is said, and the Cowbell Orchestra is rehearsing for
a great welcome.
MY TH ANKS GIVING
Foe all the good my dayi afford,
Fot all the blessing* on roe poured,,
For every kindly act and word,
1 thank Thee, Lord.
I thank Thee, Lord, for thoughts that rota
Beyond the narrow walls of home
To gather good from days to come,
And from the past.
I thank Thee, Lord, for length of days,
For guidance through life's devious ways.
And in the darkness for the raya
Of light and love.
1 thank Thee e'en fot hour* of gloom.
For crushing grief, and darkened room} |
For in the shadow Thou didst cosae
To heal and bless.
1 thank Thee that the weight of things
No longer binds my soul's fiee wings.
Than she can soar, and «oaring sings
Thy praise, O Lord!
That sae and mountain, flower and tree.
Their message bring to me of Thee,
And fill my soul with ecstasy,
1 thank Thee, Lord.
And so not only on this day.
When, many hearts thanksgiving say.
But now forever and alway,
I thank Thee, Lord!

Murphy Is Made
U. S. Commiss'n'r
Appointed by Bourqufn
to Fill Vacancy at
Cur Bank
Ed Murphy is a rather modest
appearing fellow, but that does
not seem to be a barrier to his
pet ambitions— matrimonial and
otherwise- but that is some
thing else, diverging from what
we started out to say, and as
the serial story editor says—
"Continu-, d in our next issue."
Through the activities of local
friends Ed has been given the
appointment as U. S. Commis
sioner. to fill the vacancy caused
by the death of Charles N.
Thomas. Shortly after the
death of Mr. Thomas friends of
Mr. Murphy circulated a peti
tion praying for his appoint
ment by Federal Judge Bour
quin. This week he was noti
fied that he had been given the
appointment and he will soon
qualify for service.
The appointment will meet
with general approval. Ed is
competent to handle the work
and is obliging and painstaking,
prime requisites for the filling
of positions of this nature.
A surprise silver shower was
tendered Miss Emma Croff at
her home here last evening, by
the ladies of the Catholic Guild.
The bride-to -be was presented
with a number of very pretty
gifts in silverware. The ladies
spent a most enjoyable evening
in various amusements and all
took occasion to dole out sage
advice to the bride-elect, as to
her coming responsibilities.
Clapper & Bakke announce
that they have secured the

Shed. They hope to be able to
keep the Ford sales up to the
mark set by Mr. Larson.
