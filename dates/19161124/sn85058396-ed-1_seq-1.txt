forces have assumed the offensive in the province of Dobrudja,
j says the official statement issued today by the Rumanian war
department, and have advanced along the entire front, cap
! i turing several towns about fifteen miles north of the Tcher-
navoda-Constanza railroad line.

conquest of Little Wallachla is an
nounced today by Berlin. Orsova and
Turnu-Severin on the Danube have
been captured by the Austro-German
forces which have broken the resist
ance of the Rumanians In this section
of west Rumania.
No mention is made of the fate of
the Rumanian forces which were de
fending the Orsova region. The re
treat of these forces is assumed to
have been cut off with the recent cap
ture by General von Falkenhayn's
armies of Craiova and with It the only
main line railroad leading eastward.
Pushing eastward from the Jiul val
ley after their capture of Craiova, the
Austro-German forces are now an
nounced as approaching the Alt val
ley. It is along this valley that the
Rumanians apparently have elected to
make their next stand. Bucharest
yesterday reported a withdrawal of
the Rumanians from the Jiul region
and announced they were holding
their own in the Alt valley.
Simultaneously a movement has
been started, presumably by tho Bul
garians, which may prove of notable
importance. Bucharest reports an at
tempt by hostile forces to cross the
Danube at ZImnitza, 35 miles south
west of Giurgiu, on tho railroad lead
ing to Bucharest. This move if suc
cessful would mean a cutting in far
behind tho present Rumanian line
along the Alt. ZImnitza is 70 miles
southwest of Bucharest.
Russians Make County Move.
On tho other hand tho Russians
have made a counter move in Dobrud
ja. Petrograd announces that they
are pushing south and have reached
to Lake Tashaul, about twelve miles
north of Constnnza, which is the
Black sea terminal of the railroad
from Tchernavoda, and have crossed
the Kartal river. Berlin announces a
battle in this region declaring that
the Russians were thrown back from
I advanced positions.
Both east and west of Monastir on
the Macedonian front tho entente
r armies are pressing tho Germano-Bul-,
garian lines nard and making further
( advances, according to the .French

pulse of local attacks by entente

the newspapers." The council of the
empire has been adjourned by impe
rial ukase until December 2.
Liberals Win Victory.
Tho retirement of Premier Stunner
and tho appointment of M. Trepoff as
his successor probably are outgrowths
of what has been referred to in a few
carefully censored Petrograd dispatch
es recently as a serious political cris
is. The chango apparently implies a
victory for tho Liberal elements of
Russia over the 'bureaucratic regime,
for Sturmer always has been promi
nent in the affairs of the Russian bu
reaucracy, while M. Trepoff in the
past has engaged in a variety of re
form work.
A recent Petrograd dispatch quoted
Paul Mllukoff, one of the prominent
Liberal leaders, as saying an agree
ment had ben reached between the
government and the duma which was
entirely satisfactorily to tho repre
sentatives of tho people, but there had
been no previous Intimation that this
would "result In the retirement of the
premier. In fact, a dispatch filed In

that M. Sturmer was convinced the
crisis had passed and that the exist
ing order would remain without
change for the present at least.

SIR HIRAM MAXIM
DIES IN LONDON
Was Inventor of Automatic
System of Firearms and
Many Other Mechanical
Devices.
BORN IN MAINE
Appointed in 1915 as Member
of Inventions Board to Meet
Needs of War.
London, Nov. 24. S:20 a. m. Sir
Hiram Maxim, Inventor of the auto
matic system of firearms, died, at his
home hero early this morning.
Sir Hiram Maxim was born in San
gerville, Maine, on February 5, 1840.
He was a descendant of English Pur
itans who were among the early set
tlers of Plymouth county, Massachus
etts. After a meager schooling he
went to work in a machine shop and
later was employed in the machine
works of his uncle, Levy Stevens, at
Fitchburg, Mass. At 2S he was a
draftsman in a large steamship build
ing concern in New York city, where
: he invented a new locomotive head-
light which went into general use.
He also did much to perfect auto
matic gas machines for lighting pri
vate houses. In 1877 he took up the
question of electricity and was among
the fh'st to make dynamo electric
machines and electric lamps in the
"United States. He took out a great
many patents on electrical machinery
and in 1881 was made a chevalier of
'the Legion" of Honor by President
Grevy.
The Maxim automatic gun was in
vented in London and was immediate
ly adopted by the British govern
ment, which used the gun at Mata
bele. The gun fired 600 rounds a
minute and caused such slaughter
that parliament seriously discussed
the question as to whether its use was
justified. Some years later Sir Hir
am, created a baronet by Queen Vic
toria after having become naturalized
as an Englishman, invented tho first
smokeless powder.
In 1S94 Sir Maxim invented a heav
ier than air flying machine which
raised itself from the ground carry
ing a driver and passenger. This
was nine years before tho first prac
ticable airplane was created by the
Wright Brothers. Sir Hiram's ma
chine was a ponderous affair and
broke down In its early trial. In 1915
the inventor was appointed a member
of tho inventions board created by
the government to meet the needs of
tho war.

EVERY MAN TO

Germany to Mobilize and Place
at Work All Men Between
17 and 60.
London, Nov. 24. 9:50 a. m. The
German auxiliary service bill is con
sidered by Secretary of the Interior
von Loebell as surpassing in import
ance all previous war measures, ac
cording to an Amsterdam dispatch to
Router's describing tho debate on the
bill before the main committee of the
relchstag.
Secretary von Loebell opened the
debate on the bill, which provides for
the services of all men from 17 to GO.
He said that besides the millions
whom it would render llablo to ser
vice in the army, it would affect three
million others to be called upon for
other services In the war "which Is
not only a war of armies but a war
of political economy, a war of na
tions." Explaining that the object of the
bill was the mobilization of labor, the
minister declared that, instead of the
lack of employment, which prevailed
at the beginning of tho wan. there was
now a positive lack of labor, especial
ly in the manufacture of munitions
and war matorial of all kinds. He
said the bill is intended to assure the
sustenance of the laboring population
and that compulsion would only be
used as n last resort and was not
needed for women.
"The bill must prove to tho whole

General Grounerpolntedput that
the exertions of tlie "Britislf"mlnistry
of munitions necessitated a consid
erable increase in the manufacture of
munitions in Germany. He explained
that the bill proposed to add to the
army all men liable for service who
had hitherto been regarded as indis

GER5ngship
Submarine Did Not Attack
British Hospital Ship Britan
nic in Aegean Sea.
London, Nov. 24, 12:30 p. m. A vir
tual disavowal that a German subma
rine had anything to do with the sink
ing of the British ship Britannic in
tho Aegean sea is contained in a wire
less dispatch received today from Ber
lin which reads:
"According to the reports so far at
hand, the Britannic was proceeding
from England to Saloniki. For a
journey in this direction tho large
number of persons on board was ex
traordinarily striking and justifies a
strong suspicion of the misuse of a
hospital ship for transport purposes.
"Inasmuch as the ship bore the dis
tinguishing marks of a hospital ship,
in accordance with regulations thero
can naturally be no question of a
German submarine in connection with
the sinking."
