KENDRICK. LATAH COUNTY. IDAHO. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 24. 1916
NUMBER 47
A Reader's Version
The following letter was received
from a former resident of Kend
rick. We believe the criticisms it
contains are of the right sort. If
we would all get busy and criticize
the town critics, instead of our
town, better results would follow.
Editor Gazette ;— Glancing over
the last issue of the Gazette, I find
numerous letters written by busi
ness men on the subject of "What's
The Matter With Kendrick." One
business man says, "I cannot give
the name of a single yoüng man
from Kendrick who has graduated
from a College within the past ten
years." This sounds like a typical
wail of the pessimist. Without
even considering facts or looking
up records, he criticizes the town
at the expense of the young men
who have gone out, Sir, I can give
you the names of a score of young
men and women from Kendrick,
within the last eight years, who
have attended Colleges and Univer
sities and whose college records are
above reproach and open for your
inspection. We have graduates
from the University of Idaho, and
Washington State College, we have
graduates from the University of
Washington at Washington, D. C.
We have today students at the
most reputable medical institutions
in the country. Yes, look at the
number of normal graduates from
Kendrick and who are teaching the
younger generation today. The
fact is this, that even though Kend
rick is lacking in educational fa
cilities, the young men and women
are as full of energy and ambition
or in other words as full of "Pep and
Vinegar" as any in the state. The
best thing the town can do is to
rid itself of these pessimists and
get the Pull-together habit. Adopt
the slogan "Live and Let Live."
The little town has made wonderful
progress within the last few years.
Look at the magnificent High

say Kendrick is the biggest little
town in the northwest and she may
well feel proud of the young men
and women who have gone out

Potato Varieties
The "Great Divide" is the best
general purpose potato that can be
grown here, in the opinion of Rag
nar Kullberg, a member of the high
school garden club, who has been
experimenting in the growing of
potatoes the past two or three sea
sons. On his experimental plots
young Kullberg has grown the
Great Divide at the rate of 376
bushels to an acre, though no such
yield should be expected in grow
ing large fields for market.
The Early Rose is the best early
^-'potato, and Carmen No. 3 is the
best late potato, Mr. Kullberg
thinks. The latter is so like the
Rural New Yorker that it cannot
be distinguished from it except by
its yield, which is much greater for
the Carmen No. 3.
Selecting the best potatoes from
the best hills for seed is the secret
of growing large crops of good po^
tatoes, says Mr. Kullberg. He be
lieves that many people make the
mistake of not cutting their seed
carefully. Experiment has shown
that there should be two or three
eyes on each piece of seed put in.
Ground that has been in alfalfa and
clover makes particularly good po
tato land.—Star-Mirror.

been so great, due to the first report of the election of Hughes anti then the switch to President Wilson. No decisive war
actions were reported from any of the various fronts. A train wreck at New Portage Junction, Pa., caused the death of ten per
sons and serious injury to twenty others. A lightship, the Relief, was added to the many craft in New York harbor. In England services are being held out
of doors, and prayers are offered daily for the successful termination of the war.

The affair in which the men took . f
part, according to the evidence, 1 0
was the result of a mob spirit on j f
the evening of October 13, when
another federal officer by the name
of Hanson, assisting Minnis to ar
rest alleged violators of the laws
prohibiting traffic of liquor with
Indians, shot Fred Stevens of Lap
wai outside a dance hall in the
presence of a large crowd. j
The government brought out in
its case that Weeks went for a rope' s
and brought it to the hotel where
Minnis went following the shooting-.
and to which the victim had been
taken, and threw it on the steps
admonishing "someone ,to put it on ^
him I'll do the rest.' '
The defense contended that Weeks
was not responsible for his rash act
on account of intense suffering from
wounds infllicted by one of the of
ficers who struck him while trying
to arrest him.

Hupp Wins Match
One of the best amateur wrest

was pulled off at • the Barnum
Theatre last Thursday night be
tween Orphie Hupp of Little Bear
ridge and Will Mielke of Cameron.
It was exciting from start to finish
and the two contestants were even
Mielke, being about
35 pounds heavier and much strong

advantage in the first part of the
bout, getting the first fall in 35
minutes and 15 seconds.
Hupp was game and full of grit
and by conserving his strength be
gan to show up strong in the last
two falls, securing the second fall
in 15 minutes and 21 seconds and
the third in something over 22
minutes.

At the End of a Good Road
To see what really happens at the
end of the good road, a public road
specialist of the U. S. Agricultural
department recently had observa
tions made in different sections of
country. The observers noted many
country-bound teamsters who drove
two loaded wagons, hitched one be
hind the other, to the end of the
good road, and then found it neces
sary to leave one wagon by the
roadside to be'returned for later,
while all the power of the their
teams was devoted to hauling a
single wagon over the unimproved
road.

two loads were consolidated and
easily hauled by a single team the
remaining distance to market over
the improved highway.
In one section of the country
where oxen are still uSèd, teamsters
were observed to bring their loads t
over the dirt roads with two or
three yokes of oxen. When "the be

One phase of the recent election
gives genuine satisfaction to the
people of the far west regardless of
their politics. This is the fact that
the balance of power has been
wrested from New York, that a
president can be elected without
the 45 electoral votes of the empire U
state.
Early on the night of the election,
when it was learned that New York
As The Idaho Post Sees It
had gone overwhelmingly for Jus
tice Hughes; when it was made cer
tain that Tammany had "knifed"
President Wilson, a roar went up
that reached from ocean to ocean.
It was taken for granted that the
nation would follow in the footsteps
of New York—it had never failed
since the Civil war.
No doubt the betting fraternity
in Wall street and other nearby
gambling resorts became aware,
days before the election, that Jus
Jtice Hughes was to carry New York
by a great vote, and on this know
ledge they bet millions sending
money to all parts of the country
where takers could be found. In
their judgement it was absolutely
impossible for {he country to go
against the mandate of New York.
Yet this is just what happened.
The New York gamblers lost their
millions and New York surrendered
her scepter of political power. The
federal reserve bank act had already
deprived Wall street of the power
to corner the money of the nation.

Wholly outside of all partisan j ^

consideration, this is a glorious vie

the whole world to sit up and take
notice of the western half of the
continent. It will compel leaders
of all parties to take the woman
voter into their future calculations.
It will make it seem less of a joke

to speak of western men like Will

It is a fearful shock to those who

Death of Jack London
Jack London, one -of California's
best known authors, passed away at
his Glen Ellen ranch near Santa
Rosa, Cal., Wednesday, a victim of
uremic poisoning.
Jack London was born in San
Francisco, Cal., January 12, 1876.
He entered the University of Cali
fornia but did not complete his
course. He left college to go to
the Klondike during the famous
gold rush. .
He went to sea before the mast
in 1892 and followed this the next
year with g trip which included a
visit to Japan and a seal hunting
cruise in the Bering sea. In 1894
he tramped through tne United
States for the purpose of making a
first hand study of social and eco
nomic problems, which he used
with his other experiences in his
prolific writings.
In 1906 London built a 55-foot
yacht, the Snark, and 1907-1909 he
cruised the south seas in it.
His life was stressful and many
of his books, particularly "John
Barleycorn", were popularly ac
cepted as autobiographical exper
iences. He was an indefatigable
writer. Early in his career he set
himself the task of writing a cer
tain amount every day and he lived
U P to the undertaking to the last,
London was deeply interested in
socialism and latterly devoted him
self to faim,n £' a hobby, he testi
fied in court a few days ago, to
which he devoted all the earnings
from his pen. He made a deep
study of agricultural problems and
recently qualified as an expert on
' rr 'Kation.
He married Bessie Maddern of
Oakland, Cal., April 7, 1900, and
November 19, 1907, married Char
mion Kittbridge of Berkeley, Cal.
London came into 1'terary promi
nence in 1903 when he published
"The Call of the Wild." This was
followed the next year by The Sea
Wolf. He was the author of at
least forty books, several plays and
innumerable short stories.
