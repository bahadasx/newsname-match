jars to arrange all the various

HEATH OF E. K. PENDERGAST
About b o’clock last Thursday even
i»fi, just after th o Gazette had been
printed, word was received of the s'.id
'uVeT-K t p h,B H ho,neat
’ U , K K - Fendergast. It is learned
t .mt Judge Fendergast had boon in his
usual health and spirits all day. attend
ing to business at his chambers In the
enur, house. He left for his home about
•- o tlock. Upon reaching his home, the
• udge complained of feeling nauseated.
,nd ' is wife K«ve him some simple
i emedy at hand. Mrs. Fendergas, went
to the kitchen and In a few minute
'.a- by hearing groans from
he room where she had left her hus
band Hastening back the lady found
the judge lying on the floor uncon
scious. I hysicians were Immediately
summoned and everything known to
medical science was done to restore
the stricken man. He never regained
consciousness and in a few minutes he
breathed his last. The immediate cause
°l death was pronounced to have been
heart failure.
The funeral took place Sunday after
noon under the direction of the Ma
sons, of which order the deceased was
a prominent member. A .arge number
of people from all parts of the county
.attended the funeral.
The news of Judge Pendergaal’s
death was a shock to his manv ac
quaintances in Oroville, and one and
all expressed keen regret at his un
timely taking off. While from all out
ward appearances of robust health the
judge was far from being a well man,
He was a sufferer from that Insidious
disease, diabetls, ana had been afflicted
with blood poisoning for several
months. Vet even with these Infirma
tlves no one thought that his condition
was serious and hence his sudden de
mise caused profound surprise. He was
a devoted husband and father and his
loss i£ a terrible blow to the family.
The heartfelt sympathy of this com
munity goes out to the stricken wife
and son in this hour of grievlous afflic
tion.
Judge Pendergast was an able and
eminent member of the bench and liar.
He was a lawyer of far more than ordi
nary ability, and as a judge made a
most creditable record. He located at
Waterville at the time of the opening
of the Columbia land office, and there
really comenced his career as a practi
tioner of the law. Some fourteen years
ago he came to Okanogan county,
whore he has since resided. He was
married at Waterville, and to that
union was born one son, who is Just
reaching man’s estate. He leaves a
wife, son, sister, Mrs. it. W. Greonburg,
o;' Spokane, and numerous other rela
tives to mourn his sudden and untime
ly death. The Okanogan Independent
contains the following brief biography
of n very active life:
“Edmond Kimball Pendergast was
born March 19, 1864, at Salisbury,
Mass. When two years of age, his
family moved to Hutchison, Minn.,
where Edmund resided until 1889. At
16 years of age lie commenced to
teach school for $25 a month, riding
horseback 1000 miles during a Minne
sota winter to and from his school,
and arriving at the school house in
time to build fires and warm the build
ing for the school children. When not
attending or teaching school ho work
ed as a farm laborer, also in a saw
mill, and v, Ith thrashing outfits, earn
ing <ll the money he expended while
receiving his legal education.
in ..nne, 1885, he graduated from
the Minnesota state high school at
Hutchinson. Four years later lie grad
uated with a degree of bachelor of
laws from the University ol Michigan,
and whs admitted to the bar of the
supreme court of Michigan, ooon aftei

I rritoiy of Washingim at Spokane.
In w‘!'P he was admitted to practice
in .| 1( . United Stati-s circuit ’our*, of
appeals at San Francisco and the Su
preme court of the United States.
He was elected mayor of Waterville,
in 1891, and during the same year was
appointed prosecuting attorney °f
Douglas county on a salary of $2uU n

>0 of them.
At the next election Fendergast was
defeated by five votes, but afterwards
was twice elected prosecuting allot

POINTERS TO PARENTS.
I lie schools are open, yet the
measles are still with us. There ar«
not manycases. but any at all are alto
gether too many. Children subject to
e disease are liable to take It whl e
t e conta ß ,on , 8 on , lt is up to ™
l-irents to prevent a spread of the
c.isease, and to prevent any sen, ~
frequences from following an at
tack of the ailment. The health offu
r continues the mandate that no
> hiren under 15 years will t, e per
mitted to attend picture shows oi pub
lic meetings. The local physicians urge
upon parents not to permit their chil
dren to go upon the street after having
•be disease until every symptom is
eradicated. Where children on the way
to recovery are permitted to run at
large there Is not only danger of
spreading the disease, but a very grave
c.mger that the measles may develop
Into pneumonia. Seven-tenths of all
1: °uble of the eyes grow out of the
measles. This was proven in some of
our neighboring towns last year when
most ot Hie children that suffered
irom this disease had to wear glasses
utter recovery, and tills could have
lieu prevented had parents used some
precaution. The advice of physicians
is that children shotted be kept In a
medium dark room for a week or tea
days after they are apparently well.
'lbis advice is lor the benefit of the
public, and it followed strictly will
save the eyesight of many a child and
be the saving ot money to parents. Fur
thermore, following that advice will
contribute to an early elimination of
the disease In the community.

DOWN FROM THE NORTH.
Win, ForJ, brother of Mrs. W. L.
Davis, arrived in Orovillo Friday last
direct from Alaska, and will spend
some time visiting with the Davis
family. It was more than a pleasure,
It was a Joy, to again meet and greet
genial Bill Ford after these many
years. Formerly Mr. Ford was a resi
d< nt of Okanogan county, and took an
active and prominent part in county
politics and county affairs. He was an
uncompromising republican, and did
much for his party when he was a
member of tiie community. Mr. Ford
went from Okanogan county to Alas
ka, where he has been living for the
past six years, putting in most of his
time at (JincJiorage. He believes that
Alaska presents to' trio man of energy
the greatest opportunities to be found
any where on earth, and predicts that
it, will yet become one of the most 1m
portant subdivisions of the the Unite 1
States, as its varied and wonderful re
sources are in the very infancy of
their development. Though well ad
vanced in years Mr. Ford is hale and
hearty and as capable of accomplish
ment as most men of half his years.
He Is a typical westerner, rugged,
sturdy, forceful, resourceful, absolute
ly fearless, a man of sterling honor
and integrity, a true and steadfast
triend, genial, kindly and genetous.
I robably it would be impossible to
wean him from Alaska, but if be ever
makes a change of residence we trust
that he will head in to Orovillo and
here spend Ills declining years.
A MARVELOUS INVENTION.
Dr. 1). 11. Lewis has his X-ray ma
chine set up and in working order. It
is a marvelous invention, ana one of
the wonders of Hie present day in
wmch science lias made such astound
ing advances. The penetrating power
of ihe Rotlgen rays is beyond all un
derstanding. The doctor has taken sev-
eial photographs of the hones of the
human body, that show the delicate
and Intricate formation of the human
organism. One of the first pictures
taken was the broken bones in Mrs.
!•:. N. Grubb’s arms, which were dislo
cated in an automobile accident. The
displacement of the bones could be
seen as plain as though the flesh had
been stripped off and the hones ex
posed. it was necessary to rehreak
iv, e hones, as as they had commenced
to knit, and Mrs. Grubb submitted to
the ordeal without raking anaesth
etics, showing remat sable nerve and
fortitude. This X-ray machine is one
of the greatest aids to modern surpuy
so far discovered, for by means of the
lays the entire interior of a patient is
exposed to view, the bones standing
cut like a skeleton, thus enabling the
practitioner to actually see the full
extent and nature of a break, fracture
or dislocation
A SERUM'S CHARGE.
Sheriff-elect Clair Ward was in town
Monday after Clark W. Carey, an Indi
vidual wanted by the authorities of
Williston, North Dakota, on a charge of
incest. It appears that Carey flew west
~ escape arrest and the South Dakota
ofifcers got a line on his wherabouts.
The sheriff’s office of Ibis county was
notified. Ward, who has proven himself
ihe most energetic officer who has evei
served in .he county, located Carey at
Swansea a station on the branch in the
south part of the county, where he has
been working as a section hand ( are>
started to leave (he county by the wa.v
"J Brewster, but doubled back and

OROVILLE. WASHIN 4TON, NOVEMBER 24, 1916
Happenings When the Laud Was
Tonng and Sparsely Settled.
(Prom Loomis Prospector, November
26. 1897.)
All summer long Win. Lewis and his
associates have been driving In a tun
nel on the north slope Hill
to tap a ledge that crops out on the
claim. Recently the boys cut into a
ledge that showed up well and an assay
just had on the product'jshows It to
carry 117.20 in gold. tOlm man Lewis
worked these claims for ibveral years
at lust becoming discouraged and re
turned to his former hotye at North
Yakima. As we have not heard of Mr.
Lewis for years it Is the presumption
that he is dead, as he was well advanc
ed in years when carrying pn this min
ing work. The claims on Whisky Hill
were never thoroughly developed, and
the only evidence of their existence Is
tile old prospect holes.)
A petltio uls being circulated to have
the postoffice at Golden reestablished.
(Today, the old site of Golden is a
plowed field. Twenty-five years ago It
was n lively place, although It rapidly
lost its population, and calmness hung
over Hie village even at the time an
effort was being made to have the post
office reopened. We were at Golden in
the spring of 1888, when the first log
cabin—and about all the houses that
afterwards 'decorated the flat were of
logs—was built. Activity in surround
ing mines soon collected quite a popu
lation at Golden, and take it up one
fide and down another Golden was a
pretty hot number during Its brief
heyday. Why, the place even boasted of
a baseball club, and a great future was
predicted for the camp. Like the old
town of Ruby, below Conconully, in its
day tlie livlieat mining to)vn in the
west, Golden disappeared from the face
of the earth, and a few years hence will
even have passed from the memory of
man.)
There was enough snow on the
ground in November 1897 to encourage
me use of sleds, although the Pros
pector slates that "sledding Is as yet,
pretty ragged around here.”
.las. H. Granger sold his ranch on
the Okanogan river, near Oroville, to
fMmuud Haney, this week, the consid
eration being $1,500. (That ranch In
cludes like 160 uguas and
considering what 160 acres I *®! land Is
worth on the Okanogan river, near
Oroville, today, it looks as though Mr.
Granger almost gave his property
away. Mr. Haney stilt owns the prop
erty. ui> to a recent date at least. Ho Is
now living in California. Mr. Granger's
w hernbouts, if living, is not known.)
November of 1897 was somewhat ot
a counterpart to the present November
as skating was the populat amusement

,). O. Calhoun lias purchased all the
lumber at Conconully. Forty or fifty
thousand feet are Inleded for Frank
Richter. (That was handling lumber
under unfavorable circumstances, mak
ing the material cost almost Its weight
in money. From Conconully Mr. Cal
houn had to have the lumber hauled to
Loomis, a distance ot 22 miles, and In
order to deliver it to Mr. Richter it
had to be hauled to Keremcos. a much
longer distance. Mr. Calhoun was liv
ing at Seattle the last we heard of him
and Mr. Richter, who in his day was
the oldest while settler on theSlmil
kameen, died a number of years ago.)
Mention Is made of Frank Keck and
Tom Pierce being out on a successful
hunt. Mr. Keck is now a resident of
of Republic and Mr. Pierce is still
Republic and Mr. Pierce is still living
at Loomis, where he has a store.
A statement Is made that freight
shipped from Spokane in October bad
not arrived the latter part of No ’em
ber and is mentioned to show that' the
man doing any kind of business in that
upper country in those days was handl
es ppod.
Ed. Thayer, who has been in Fair
view all summer, returned to Loomis
today. (Mr. Thayer is still a resident of
the Loomis neighborhood.)
Mention is made of A, L. Spencer
bringing in a load of freight. Mr. Spen
cer was one of the most reliable
frlengliters doing business in this up
per country in those days. From here
be went to Wilbur and was engaged in
farming for a long time. Nothing is
known at ibis time as to his where
abouts.
Del Hart left yesterday for the east.
He will visit Chicago, New York, rnd
a number of other eastern cities, ex
pecting to be absent until February.
(Mr, Hart made the trip at that time
on mining business, and was able to In

( ALL FOB CAUCUS.
Notice is hereby given that there will

pose of nominating the following can
didates: a mayor for two years, a

LOOKING BACKWARD.
FROM A BLUE JACKET.
It will be remembered that Otis J.
Johnson, sone of Ole Johnson, enlisted
. in the marines last summer. The young
man has already seen considerable of
the world that few of us ever have the
c pportunity to see. Moreover, he is
taking an interest in the service that
he has embraced, and is making good,
improving in efficiency and at the
same time studying. He has won recog
nitlon as a marksman, and if he keeps
on will leave the service at the expi
ißtlon of his enlistment with a credi
table and honorable record. A letter to
his brother Theodore, written- from
Mare Island, Cal., contains much of
interest, from which we take the fol
lowing exerpts;
‘‘l am a marine now and am glad 1
am in the service. I start south day af
ter tomorrow, Nov. 14, aboard the U. S.
S, Denver. 1 am with a%expeditonary
force and rated as scout. I had a hard
time passing my examination, but the
little knowledge I acquired about to
pography while I was with a survey
ing party la British Columbia was u
help in getting me through over TO
applicants. A scout's duty in time of
war is to gain information about the
enemy's movements, and he travels
from 1 to 25 miles In advance of the
I main body of the army. I am also the
t best shot in our company. I made the
highest score with army rifle, machine
gun and a 3-lnch mounted cannot.
Shooting with the rifle I made 239 out
of a possible 250, range two, three,
live and six hundred yards at a 8 and
16 inch bull's eye. You probably would
think that the wind would make no
difference in shooting but it does.
With the wind blowing at.the rate of
20 miles an hour you would have to
/nave the rear sight enough either to
the right or left to make a difference
in the aim of 36 inches. I got a silver
medal for my rifle snooting. I have to
wear the medal whenever in dress
uniform. It pays me $3 per month
extra, When I was at Santiago, 10 days
ago, about the U. S. S. Yorktown, I
v-as made gunpointer with a 3-lnch
gun, and that pays $5 extra. After I
wrote Henry 1 came back here and
wont on board the battleship York
town. She went directly to Honolulu,
staying only 24 hours. We did not get
any shore liberty. Honolulu is a nice
looking place. The first glimpse you
get is worth going that far to see.
"The Denver sUrts on the 14th, go
ing from hereto San ITlag6, and TfßtJl
there to Vera Cruiz and Nicarauga,
Panama and down the South American
i oast, then back to Seattle in about 10
months, when It is to be transferred to
tne Asiatic fleet. I will be picking
bananas within 30 days while you are
skating. 1 expect to be pretty near the
equator Christmas.”
AT THE LYRIC.
The attractions for this week at the
Lyric theater are of exceptional merit.
The hooking for Saturday and Sunday
evenings is that delightful romance
entitled “The Heart of Paula” with
Lenore Ulrich carrying the leading
role. This Is a delightful story of old
Mexico romance depicting the Intense
love, loyalty. Jealousies and devotion
of a beautiful Mexican maden for a
young American. The scenes are laid
mainly In old Mexico and has to do not
only with the wealthy Americans but
the Mexican bandits, with all their
thrills and develtry. The scenery is
beautiful beyond description and the
production Is heralded as one of the
best. In addition to the regular run
there will be the regular side splitting
Bray’s Cartoon.
For Wednesday and Thursday ot
next week there will be one of the
wildest, woollest, side-splitting featu
res that has ever been staged in this
city. On these dates Anita King, the
girl transcontlnetal race winner, will
appear in one of the most famous
features ever shown, entitled “The
Race.” It is said that in the making of
this feature more people were sent to
the hospital than In any other film that
has ever been produced, and after see
ing It you wll not wonder at that. If
you want thrills, swift action and hair
breadth escapes from instant death,
with freqeuent oases of laugh convul
sers, go see “The Race on Wednesday
and Thursday.
SECOND PRIZE.
The sceond prize at the Spokane
Exchange National bank corn show
held at Spokane this week, was award
ed to .1. J. McLaughlin, of Orovllle. As
stated elsewhere In this issue there
were several exhibits from Orovllle, all
of which attracted considerable notice
from visitors. Mr. McLaughlin was
among the exhibitors and grabbed oft
second honors. The first prize went to
W. H. Harding, of Manson, Chelan
county.
UOUNTIL MEETING.
Minutes of the regular meeting of the
town council of Orovllle, Washington,
November 20th, 1916.
Present, Mayor Samson, Councilmen
Rcale, Frlls and Smith. Minutes of the
previous meting read and approved as
read. The matter of calling a caucus
tot the nomination of candidates for
the coming town election was discuss
ed and the council recommended that a
caucus be called on November 28th for
the purpose of nominating a mayor for
two years, a treasurer for one year,
two councilmen for two years and one
councilman for one year. The clerk
asked what price the council wished to
place on blue prints of the town and
was Instructed to sell them at cost.
On motion the council adjourned.
APFOIXTED JUDGGE.
Friday last Governor Lister tele
graphed to Judge C. H. Neal that he
had been appointed judge to fill the un
explred term of the late Judge E. K.
Fendergast, whose sudden death
Thursday evening left a vacancy in the
superior court bench ot this district.
As the business of the court had to go
on this hasty action was absolute)/
necessary. It is understood that there
were several applicants, and it was
an honor to the gentleman who receiv
ed the appointment to receive the same
without personal application. It was
the proper appointment under the cir
cumstances, as a very heavy minority
of the voters of the district had voted
for Judge Neal at the primary election.
Furthermore, he has had long e.xper
icnce on the bench and made an excell
ent record while acting as judge in
tnis county and subsequently in Lin
coln county. Whether a new election
will be ordeerd or the appointment be
extended over covering the next two
years, is not known at this time.
Judge Neal left for Okanogan Monday
r ' assume the duties ot the office If
he Is continued In the position U will
le necessary for him to move to Oka
nogan, which means the loss of a val
uable citizen.

Lorltz Johnsen or Antwyne crock,
one of the early settlers of Loomis,
spent last Thursday night in Orovllle,
coming up from his ranch on a busi
ness trip. Mr. Johnson while living on
a farm, is paying more attention to
stock raising than fanning and is grad
ually building up a large herd. He is
also raising horses of a superior breed,
and between the steers and horses is
gradually accumulating a comfortable
competency. And as Mr. Johnson is
both industrious and on the square it
is a pleasure to learn that things are
at last coming his way.
The band boys have served notice
that they will give a grand ball next
Wednesday evening. Thanksgiving eve.
This social event, that promises to be
the big dance of the season, will take
place in the Orpheum. The music will
be furnished by the Justly celebrated
Orovllle orchestra, and there is not a
superior combination of melody mak
ers in the county. The dance is given
for the benefit of the band, and It is an
institution that every resident of the
town should cheerfully and liberally
support, and that support in a small
measure can be extended by investing
in a ticket of admittance. Even if you
do not dance Invest a dollar's worth,
thereby helping out a moat worthy
object.
| INCREASING SHIPMENTS
Notwithstanding there is more
1 passenger travel in and out of
Orovllle than at any railroad sta
tion in the county until the pres
ent fall freight shipments have
been rather meagre. A marked
change has recently taken place
in that respect, and the freight
tonnage handled out of Orovllle
is growing into very respectable
figures. More freight has been
billed out of this station during
the iiast mouth than during any
year since the railroad was con*
structed, and this business will
continue to grow, now that a
start bus been made, until the
freight business will become
quite an important item In the
receipts of the railroad. Among
the shipments made has been 24
cars of grain, which Included
1,600,855 pounds of wheat, 28,487
pounds of barley, 23,672 pounds
of rye and 39,926 pounds of oats.
Also seven cars of hay, three
cars of potatoes, ten cars of ap
ples and six cars of live stock.
Ci. B. Parks, of Omak, was in town
Tuesday.
Following the instructions of the
prosecuting attorney, which was con
curred in by Dr. Lewis, Justice of the
Peace Parsons dismissed the case
against Otto Mills, in which the young
man was charged with taking Dr.
Lt wis’ car, running it to Bridesvllle
and wrecking it. The young man had
at ail times declared bis Innocence of
the < rime and his friends will be pleas
ed to learn that the charge was with*
drawn by the constituted authorities.
We are always pleased to make
changes for regular advertisers, and
the best results are obtained in making
such changes, but we respectfully re
puest advertisers to get in changes not
later than Tuesday, if that be possible.
When changes are brought in later in
the week it crowds the office work,
and not infrequently delays the publi
cation of the paper a day. in order to
catch the rural routes we endeavor to
go to press with the last sides Thura*
day afternoon.
Mrs. Georgia Loundigan, of Chesaw,
yaka guest of Dr. and Ml*. fJ. B. Bfner
A c r Friday evening, and while in town
upended and greatly enjoyed the con
cert at the Orpheum. Since the death
of her husband some two years ago,
Mrs. Louudagin has conducted a store
at Chesaw and has proven to be a bus
iness woman of exceptional ability.
The lady also owns a tract of land un
dor the local irrigation system, and
her friends In this place trust that at
some future time she may come down
into the valley and make her home.
A few days ago J. H. Killian was
exhibiting some cigars the wrappers of
which were made from home grown
tobacco. So far as appearances are
concerned the clgarswere equal to any
thing in that line imported, and those
who tasted the cigars pronounced them
to he us good as any in the market.
Mr. Killan, who is a cigar maker by
trade and thus from experience is in a
position to know and pass Judgment
upon the merits of tobacco, states that
tin; local grown tobacco is equal In
every respect for wrappers to the
Connecticut or Florida grown tobacco.
That is certainly a high recommenda
tion, and If the valley lands will grow
that class of tobacco In quantities,
there is no reason why tobacco grow
ing herabouts should not become an
important and profitable industry. It
is worth experimenting with, anyhow.
A caucus has been called to meet at
the town hall next Tuesday evening
for the purpose of nominating candi
dates for certain municipal offices.
That is the customory method of plac
ing n ticket in the field at town elec
tions. The caucus is open to the entire
public, and the object is to name men
who will be satisfactory to the citi
zens. Too often the caucus falls of its
purpose. Mon will attend, take part,
aiit in the naming of candidates, and
them hold a star chamber session in
some obscure room, with a few dis
gruntled present, name other candi
dates and precipitate an unpleasant
(outest. It would be a unique change
In the old system if a representative
body of citizens got together and nam
ed a list of candidates that can be sup
ported by every resident, feeling as
sure that the men standing for office
would work for the best interests of
the entire town.
C, W. Tage. traveling representative
of the Merganthaler Linotype com
pany, stopped over In Orovllle last
Friday night on a trip through the
country. Mr. Tage installed the No.
model machine used in this office
some four years ago, and after his
eagle eye and dexterous fingers had
passed over it ho declared that the
machine, which is a marvel of human
ingenuity, to be in as good condition
as when first set up. Mr. Tage reports
that the house is far behind In their
orders for typesetting machines, which
would indicate that hand set type,
even in country offices, Is becoming
; 1. at art. Owing to the large territory
;. he has to cover Mr. Tage makes
this county only at long Intervals, It
being two years since his last visit. It
is part of his duty to keep in touch
with offices that have Installed lino
types even after the machines have
been paid for, showing that the com
pany have not lost Interest In patrons
even after all financial obligations are
met
