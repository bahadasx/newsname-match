TWO ARRESTS
IN HARRIMAN
JEWEL THEFT
Part of Gems Found
as Bank Employe
Is Taken
BROTHER TRAPPED
IN ESTATE OFFICE
Police, Working Secretly,
Tracing Missing Por
tion-?f Loot
Tvno men were arrested last nifh*
charged vith stealing the $f>5,000
worth of jewels which Mrs. K. H. llar
riman riiscovcrcd she had lost when
she dressed for the opera on the even
ing of November 13. !t was announced
that the police had recovered part of
the stolen property and that detectives
had learned where the rest was hidden
and were hunting for it.
Orville Daggett, one of the men ar?
rested, is cmployoti in the Harriman
National BanK. It was in her safe de
posit box at that bank that Mrs. Harri?
man had placeJ the black bag which
lha supposed contained the jewels !?>t
Htrch. 1lie ba? hatl lain on h" drcsv
ing table over night and she deposited
it unopened, thus making it uncertain
whether the thi.'ves obtaincd the gems
from her house at Fifth Avenue and.
Sixty-ninth Street, or?from the bank.
Arrest at Estate Offlce
Arthur P. Daggett. the other man
arrested. was found by the detectives
at 475 Fifth Avenue, the office of tbe
Harriman estate.
Although C. C. Tegethoff, man.ger
0f ,he estute. .vas informed that he
men had been arrested and someof he
,W1. recovered he refused to 1
what had been discovered about the
theft or how it happened that one of
the alleged (Uff? had been arrested
at the office of the eatatc. There was
a rumor that others were concerned
in the plot to get the jewels and that
this WM the cause of his reticence.
He is named as complainant.
The property stolen consisted of one
diamond and two rubies of largc s,ze
and w.thout toWi and a diamond stud
ued platinum chain from which the
stones were pendant.
Orville Daggett is forty-eight years
old and lives at 422 Quincy Street,
Hrooklvn. The other prisoner, who is
said to be his brother, is forty-two
years old and lives at Larchmont.
Secrecy Marks Arrest
When the jewels were stolen the
value placed upon them was JbV.,000.
On the blotter at Headquarters. how
ever. the valuc is placed at $60,000.
The same secrecy which surrounds
the arrest and the reported recovery of
??>omc" of the jewels wa? d^splayed
whtn the loss was made known last
week. It was not until after the Pin
kerton Fictective Agency had worked
on the case for two days that the po?
lice were notified and the vanishing
of the precious stones becamc public^
Detectives were assijmed to the ca>e
without the knowledge of their su
perior. and, it was said. reported prog
r, ss to a man higher than he.
Although the gems were insured with
.everal companics, there was xome
douht as to wheth.-r anything could
be recovered, owing to the myMery
which surrounded their disappeamnee.
The companies, it was said, were liable
only if the stones were stolen from
Mrs. Harriman'* house. and there
seemed to be at least a possibility that
they had been -tolen from the Harri?
man National Bank.

350,000 BELGIANS
ALREADYEXILED
Foreign Minister Sends
Pleas to Madrid
and Rome
Havre, Nov. 23. "The Germans boast'
of having already deported 350,000
men," says the Belgian Minister of For?
eign AfFairs in a telegram sent te the
Belgian ministers at Rome and Madrid
to be communicated to Pope Benedict
and King Alfonso. The telegram fol
lows:
"The situation in Belgium is becom
itig day by day more frightful. The
raids on valid Belgians now extend
throughout the whole country. If they
are not sent to work in (iermany in miir
nitions factories, they are sent to the
occupied parts of France to work on
systems of trenches and the stratcgic
railways of F,ille, Aulnay and Givct.
The Germans boast of having already
deported 350,(100 men.
Factories Being Slripped
"Rcqulsitions of materials eontinue,
with the objeet of hindering after
peace a resumption of work. I'o sup
pre.ss rompetitiori and ruin the coun?
try, machines which could be used have
been carried off or hold as old iron.
"The Governor Generul pretends in
declarations made to a reporter that
deportations in mass pass without in
cident. and even that the Belgians go
joyfully. In renlity, they luffer at the
same time moral torture and the physi
ca! pains of slavery. The (lermsn Ifov
ert'.inent tries to excuse itself by the
neressity of rombating the unemploy
ment which they themselves created by
forbidding the communrs to employ un
employed without their authorizution,
and by preventing them, as in I.uxem
burg, from being used for public works
or in exploiting the coal fields of Lim
burg."
Delivered (her to Vlolenre
"Belgium is delivered over to the vio
lence of the military authorities, while
th. ehrll authorities approve and stand
aside.
"Insist strongly that the government
to which you are accredited invite" the
German government to reflect on the
consequences of the treason to human
ity committed in its name. (iermany
before she is forced to abandon our
country wants to leave it in the condi
tion of a corpse, but while thus en
gaged in torturing it she is putting
hernelf under the ban of nationa. and
instead of impoiiing peace on her ad
versan<?s by terror, she is only runing
the civilized world against her."

the campaign against the high cost of
living yesterday.
Should present high prices of coal
and food continue, these measurcs, the
city's experts believe, will offer imme
diate relief to New Yorkers. The
Mayor has completed the machinery
under which he proposes to collect
and distribute coal, if necessary, so
that the plan could go into effect
within forty-eight hours. The cold
storage proposal, although less defi
nite, Ia looked upon as almost equally
promising.
Meanwhile. other city, county and
borough officials entered the campaign
against high prices with offers of aid
that ranged from sending guilty food
speculators to jail to reorganizing the
city's old market system and permit
ting small dcalers to use booths free,
if need be.
Several Meetlnga Srhedulrd
Half a dozen meetings have been
scheduled for the next few days, and
the leaders in the movement an
nouneed their conviction that the
promise of drastic action would re
sult in forclng food eommodities down
to something approaching normal
prices within forty-eight hours.
Mayor Mitchel's plan for providmg
coal at reasonable price in the city's
tenement districts came after a con
ference with coal producers and deal
ers, who agreed to furnish the fuel
with which to carry out the project,
An offer of suffieient cash to place the
first supply at the disposal of the city
came from members of the Mayor's
Food and Market Commission, thus re
moving every obstacle from the course
suggested a few days ago.
The city's programme is based upon
the simple scheme of having the mu
niripal dump wagons, that carry ashes
and garbage from tenement houses,
rcturn with the necessary coal to heat
them. Since the wagons empty their
refuse near the very spots on the river
banks where coal is delivered. and,
under normal times, return empty, it
is thought that little extra energy or
time will be necessary. The coal, it ',
is proposed, will be taken on the re?
turn trip and delivered to the con- :
sumers who to-day purchase fuel by
the basket from cellar dealers.
Only in Caae of Hifh Prkea
"Of course, this plan will be carried
out only if high pricej continue," the
Mayor explained. "W'e bave no desire
to put the city in the coal busineis
unless tho small dealers or specu?
lators force us to."
Mayor Mitehel issuel tbii itatement
exjdaimng his plan:
"For some time, through Mr. Wall
stein, Commissioner of Accounts; Mr.
Hartigan. Commissioner of Weights
aad Maaaoraaj Commissioner Woods
and other departments, I have b.en
making an ir.ve'tigation of the exorbi
tant price of coal to the smali con?
sumer. As a raaalt, I have reached.
the conclusion that some dealers in
the city have taken advantage of an
tpparent shortage in the supply of coal '
and have boosted the price, especiaily
to thoso people who buy it by the
bucketful.
"I have been in personal conference
with a number of the producers of coal
and v ith some of the larger dealers m
this citv. I have said to these men
that with increasing cost ot foodstulfs
the increase in cost of coal will be an
added burden that will b*e intolcrable,
aad I propose to do everything in my
power to prevent it.
Has Aaked Producers to Aid
??! have c.-ked the producers and
th<*e large dealcrj to do everything,
':.,>? an immediately to tn-1
? the ?uppiy of coal to this city,
and they have very promptly agree 1
to do all in the.r power to relieve the
ittnatioa. This <.hould in itaelf reduce
the eoat cf coal U the small consumer,
but if it does not, or if with colder
weither the price is raised to exorbi

the following course:
"Through the Mayor'? Food Supply
Coamitta* I have received an offer of
whatever tir.ancial aid is necessary *o

a lnrge kupply of coal. The producers

CZAR RUSHES
RUMANIA AID
Reinforced Russians
May Strike Flank
of Falkenhayn
London, Nov. 23. The situation in
Rumania still ia veiled in mystery, with
the fate of King Fedinand's troops at
Orsova still In the balance. But from
Berlin comes this signiffcant announce
ment:
"On the eastern border of Transyl
vania the Russians have been rein?
forced."
This sUtemeut may explain the con
fidence in high ctreles here despite the '
serious situation created by the German
occupation of Craiova and the swift
advance that cut off the Rumanians on j
the west. For Rumania, in the hasty
withdrawal in Wcstern Wallachia, may !
be pursuing the same tactics that guid
ed the Austrians in their retreat last |
summer before the Pumanian invaders I
of Transylvani'i.
Rumania's hope of salvation has been
tha Russian armies. If the Czar's troopa
eai launch a heavy blow from the Mol
davian line thoy will imperil Falken?
hayn'* flank and so force his with?
drawal from Wallachia.
Falkenhayn'a Strength I? Isaue
The announcement that the Russians
are strengthening their line along the
eastern border leads increased strength j
to the feeling that sueh a move is I
planned. Whether Falkenhayn has suf-1
ticient forces to repel that stroke is the
vital issue.
Buchur'st at length has broken ei-;
lence. She announces the withdrawal
of the Rumanian armies in the Jiul ;
Valley to "their old positions," but |
makes no mention of the evacuation of
Craiova.
The German and Russian communiea
tions report little change, Berlin claim
itig the capture of 300 railway trucks in
Craiova.
Few deductiens are drawn from these
statements, but there seems to be no
uoubt that a considerable Rumanian
force is still holding Orsova and, if de
featcd, will face a periloue situation.
Rumanians Deatroy Urldge
As if to anticipate a Bulgarian at-;
tempt to strike into R imania from the
south the Rumaniana have blown up the
biidge at Carabia, the end of the rail?
way line that runs from the Danube to
the Craiova-Bucharest road.
This is held by eome observers to in
dicate that King Ferdinand's troops are :
in straits, but the general feeling of
optimism is growing. It is beheved
that the Allied troops in the Dobrudja
will attack Mackenaen before long.
They advanced along the Black Sea
coast to-day, capturing two towns and
driving nearer to Conttanza.
Bucharest reports that the winter haa
set :n week* earlier than usual. Heavy
-? t-w has fallen in Transylvania and the
A.ps and intense cold pravaili every

Reinforced, Teutons
Fail in Monastir Attack
London, Nov. 23. Heavily reinforced
by Prussian Guard troops and new
Bulgarian formations, the Teutonic
forces launched fierce counter attack*
jesterday from their new line in the :
mountams north of Momstir. The
Geiman-Bulgar armies failed la every
attempt to regain lost grcund, but
were successful in holding u.i the ad
vance of tne Allied right and centre.
On the extreme left of Genrral Ser

IBr Cahle (o Tt>? Trtbur.t 1
London, Nov. 24.?An attcmpt ?p
parently is about to be made to
shelve Premier Asqutth .nd placo
Lloyd George at the head of the Cab?
inet. All aigns point that way, but
it is inrpossible to estimate tho
ehar?ces of the opponent? of the Pre?
mier, who has faced the MHM situa
tion successfully several times sinco
the coalition was formed.
New seriousness is given to the
situation by developments of the l.st
few days, emphasizing thrpe issues.
"The Daily Mail" dedares th.t a
critical situation has arisen in con
sequence of the government'a ro>
peated postponement of considera
tion of the British Air Board's de
mand for greaU?r powers and tho
Admiralty's refusal to grant them.
It intimates that if the question i*
not taken up at the War (ouneil to
day important resignations are proh
able.
Greater Energ) Asked
All the morning papers display
prominently an appeal by Sir Will
iam Robertson, chief of the Imperial
Staff, for greater energy in the war.
"There is no doubt whatever of our
ability to wi. the war if only we reaily
put our backa int-i it,'' he say*. "We
have not yet done this. We still do
not recognize the issues at stake nor
the efforts we ought to make and can
make if we will but try.
"I have every conndence in my
countrymen, but they arc not yet fully
awake."
"The Times," referring to reccnt
criticisms of the Admiralty. says th.t
the government now rccognizes the
necesaity of strcngthening the bo.rd.
Certain changes are impend'.ng, the
paper says, and are likely to be pub
lished within the next few days."
The Conservative "Morning Po^t"
refers to Lloyd George .s "the power
that makes for victory; he is a force
to which the nation may adhere, and
which the nation may follow."
"The Evening Standard" chimes in
with:
"There is a natural reluctanee to
show any dixloyalty to the Prime Min?
ister, but it i. strongly feit that new
blood and new ideas are wanted. and
Unionists are beginning to look on
Lloyd George .s the onlv possible
natural le.der to e.rry on the w.r ?nd
attack the work of reconstruction ef
ter the war."
Advoc.tes New P.rty
It continue. with advoeacy of the
formation o( . new p.rty, to be headed
by Lloyd George and composed of Lib
erals who have abjured free trade and
Unionista who want to get rid of the
lrish difflculty and cut adrift from the
traditional policy on land, Chureh,
House of Lorda, l.bor and other qu??
tions.
Many thinga may happen thia wlnUr,
including a change in the Cabinet, but
it ia cert.in th.t Asquith h.. a power
ful hold. There are so many eonfliet
ing forces and so great a confusion of
intereata that it ia dtffieult to form and
hold together any ron.iiderable opposi?
tion.
There are two factiona in the nation,
both eqooJIr desirou. of winning the
w.r, but ditfering aa to methoda. ,One
believes in atrong action, the other
prefers to move alowly and cautiouel).
The tirst f.ction cor.aiders BriUin's
methods in Greece we.k; the other ia
satisried with those methoda.
But in both factiona are aome rr.en
who are not agreed over the vital
issues. The Irsah Nationals, for in
st.nce. ur.ite with the Unionista on
or.e proposition, with the Liber.la on
another. I'nlees the opposition ean
unite on aome single vital iaane, it
will have little power. So far it haa
failed to unite.
There are aeveral issues whleh are
cauaing dissatisfaction-the Insh
question, Greece, the food situation,
the Admiralty m.nagement and the
South W'.le. difficultiea.
Want War 1'uahed Faater
The Tribune's recent editorial re
garding the British and French objects
of the war expresaea ex.ctly the ff?l
ing of members of the growing opposi?
tion. They do not want peace until
Germany admita ahe ia wrong and un?
til they have a gu.rantee that there
will be no repetition of this war. They
want to tight hard they don't want to
prolong the w.r, .nd they w.nt . cleaa
cut victory. Briefly, their motto is tho
anf.thesis of "to wait and see."
But Asquith's wonderful Parlia
mentary ubiiity, hi. cleverncaa tr> de
b.te .nd his poaition give him a big
.dvantage, no rr.atter who head. the op?
position. Lloyd George has many
friends, but he also haa enemtea among
men who onco were hia frienda and
aupportera.
The lull in the rightirg is bound ii
turn people's minds mofe and more to
home affaira.
