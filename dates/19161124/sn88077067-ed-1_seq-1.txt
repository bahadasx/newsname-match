A NEW TII .KH(ilVI.J
yeeai
New York WprldJ
The President's Thanksgiving pro
cla matlon this year takes on an at
tercd form. It not merely appoints
a day for the American people to ren
dor thanks for peace and prosperity
which they enjoy hut admonishes
them to give heed to the warring
countries of Europe from which these
blessings have been . withheld "to
think In deep sympathy of the peo
pies of the world upon whom the
curse and terror of the war have so
pitilessly fallen, and to contribute out
of our abundant means to the relief
of their sufferings. It Is an appeal
for the observance of the anniversary
not ns a day ot self-satisfied gratitude
for our material gain but as a day of
comrurlsAn and charity for the suff
orers whom the war has deprived not
only of co:nfort and wealth but of
home and kindred.
This Is a new not and a new spirit
in American 1 nannsgivinj oDser
vance, a spirit of fellowship and bro
therhood r.nd mercy. U marks
long spiritual advance from the old
idea of Thanksgiving that "we hae
meat and we can eat, and so the Lord
be thanklt." Much as Americans
have heard of the devastation of the
war, they have yet no adequate con
ceptlon of the distress and destitution
uid calamity it has brought upon
once peaceful and happy lands.
To devote the day. therefore, to
taking thought of the evils visited
upon them and from which we have
happily escaped, and to -make it a day
of sympathy and relief, with some of
the aspects of humility of an old New
En eland fast dav. will be to out the
observance of Thanksgiving this yeaf
to its highest use. Least of all
should It be celebrated as a day of
thanks for what we have gained
through the misfortunes of other
people's.

years, well known in this city and
county, died at his home at Versailles
as the result of injuries sustained in
an accident near Osgood on last
Th.irsday night. Ju?t how the acci
dent happened may never be known,
but. conditions near the scene of the
accident lead to supposition that the
buggy in which he v.as riding was
side-swiped by an au'.omobile, which
tore off a rear wheel and dum.ped the
occupant into the ditrh, where he lay
unconscious until early Friday morn
ing. He regained consciousness a few
minutes before he died, and when
questioned as to the accident re
plied that "it dida't matter; he
couldn't live, and if he told nothing
no trouble would come."

of the best judges of live stock in this

prosperous and influential, but drink
got the best of him. For several
years hi resided in this city, coining

DETROIT
Now the Largest Anti-Saloo
City in America
Prohibition Gain of Five Stales
Leads to Dope of Submission
of National Amendment.
Philadelphia. Temperaie look live
ore States In Tuesday's elcitlun and
half the lint I. Ml is dry.
Prohibition swept Michigan. Souih Da
kota, Nebraska and .Montana, and t'tah
electe d a Governor und a Legislature ab
solutely pledged to tile principle that lli-
uor hus no place In a modern community
Tho eli t tlan brings the numlier of com
ple tely dry Mates up to twenty-four, and
upon the returns the anti-saloon leade-rs
of iho country base predictions that the
We bb Smitli-cJallinger-.Sl.eppard rendi
tion for u prohibition amendment to the
National Constitution will be passed by
Congriss In December or January.
"It is clllllcult to believe that Congress
can continue to resist, the proposition
that tliis amendment be submitted to the
people In face of the overwhelming senti
ment, not alone in favor of the rer.se, lutiim
Itself, but absolutely In favor of prohibi
tion," said 11. M. Chalfat, ed tor of the
Pennsylvania edition of the State Antl
Saloon League. "1 llrmly believe that the
riscilullon will receive a sulllclent num
ber of votes to win, If not from the
present Cogn.ss, then surely from the
next."
The result In Michigan makes Detroit
the largest dry eily on the continent up
to date. The light In -Michigan was one
of tlio most brilliantly conducted cam
paigns on tiler part of Ihe foes of liiiuor,
that was ever waged In America.
Some of the richest men In the State
aligned themselves on the side of prohi
bilion and gave freely of their wealth to
lin.ence ihe light. One of Ilium ,11 not
the most promient, was Se-bastian S.
Kresger, river and ten cent store proprie
tor, who, when the campaign begun, gave
S1O.0UU to start it. His lead was followed
by a number of others and a $lau.tiiM) fund
was put up in one day. The brewers
heard of Kresge's gift and sent word that
they woudl boycott his stores. He wrote
back that he had received their letter,
was glad to know how they felt anelcon-
luded with the statement that their at-
titudc! had led him to pour another $10,-
ihm) into Hie light. Next day the treasur
er of the prohibition forces received the
check.
t'rohibition has been an issue in .Mich
igan for many years, buf It was only
once before put up to tho people, 'that
was in 18N7, when it was re jected.
In Pennsylvania, the anti-satoon ele
ment Is claiming credit for the de tent of
Congressman A. J. Ilarchfeld, of Pitts
burgh, ami of Congressman Warren
Worth Bailey, of Johnstown. Jlarchfelel
is a Republican,' while Kaih-y Is a De ino-
rat. lie Anti-baloon l-,eague lights
ithout regard to party.
Probably the biggest factor In the pro
hibition hope that Congress will piuss the
amendment resolution is the fact that the
resolution in 1!I14, then know as the
Hobson resolution, rece-iveel 1'J7 votes,
tight more than were cast against it.
But it required a two-third vote.
v hue twenty-four states are eitherr
dry at present or will be within the next
ear, some of the Stales allowing the
loons a year to close, prohibitionists
helm that most of the territory In the
other states has abolished drink tlu-ough
the inslruuient .of local option, ft is de-
lared that tour-htths of the luiuor trar-
11c is now ce-ntered in the big cities.
Ihe dry Staters, including those which
voted for prohibition on Tuesday, are as
follows:
Alabama, rizona. Arkansas, Colorado,
Gerorgla, Kansas, Idaho, Iowa, .Mississip

of the Three Counties Oil Co., Of
Portland. The well is located on the
Frank Slaughter farm, one-half mile
east of Sharpsburg and was shot Frl.
day forunoon of last week. Oil was
thrown high over the derrick and it
Is estimated that the daily production
of the well w ill be about 72 barrels.
A large numbe- of spectators,
some of whom were in the oil busi
ness witnessed the shooting and sev
eral speculators immediately began
to lease the surrounding territory.
The Standard Oil Co. suspected that
the well would be a success several
weeks ago and quietly leased 55 acres
adjoining the Sttigh.er farm. The
Standard and other companies hold
many more leases besides the great
number that have been "wlld-cated .
Two Fort Recovery business men
obeyed an impulse early this fall and
leased several hundred acres In the

hns never been tapped and the drill
