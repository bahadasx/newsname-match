TAZEWELL, Vll
NO PREACHING
TO HIS SOLDIERS
General Funston Refuses Per?
mission to Baptist Preacher to
Hold Services in Mexican Bor?
der Camps.
The Baptist denomination, or a part
of it, at least, arc having a small mix
up with General K?nsten on the Mex?
ican border, which has caused some
sensations and protests, etc.
The facts as gathered from the
State papers and tho Now York
World are about as follows:
Dr. Ganibrcll, a prominent Baptist
minister of Texas, living near the
border, nnd perhaps other Baptist
ministers of Texas, requested Gen?
eral Fuuston's permission to hold re?
vivals among tho soldiers nt the
front. Tho request was refused, it
seems, by General Funsten, who stat?
ed, according to dispatches, that he
did not want tho soldiers stirred up
nnd excited by being told that they
were lost nnd going to hades?that
it frustrated discipline in camp nnd
that a general religious excitement
among the troops would cause troub?
le and in tho interest of "good gov?
ernment," tho request of the minis?
ter to hold revivals in enmp was re?
spectfully declined, and right there
General Fred started something.
Tho mntter got into the papers in
Texas. There was a protest against
the intcrferenco of General Funston.
He was forbidding the right of min
istors in tho exorcise of "freedom of I
conscience nnd religious liberty,"
guaranteed by the constitution of the
United States. The news was wired
:o New York. A Baptist minister in
that city turned himself loose in a
sermon from his pulpit, advising the
soldiers to whom tho right nnd priv?
ilege of the gospel were denied, to
resign immediately from the nrmy
and come home. The Now York
World, editorially, took the minister'
to task, nnd said ho wna, putting it
mildly, "seditious," nnd condemned
his course severely. Other Baptists
ministers were interviewed nnd said
thoy had no criticism to offer ngainst
General Funsten's order, nnd that no
official notice was likely to bo takon
of the matter by the New York min?
isters.
The Baptist in Norfolk Convention
Send Protest to the President.
Tho action of Genernl Funston was
taken notice of by the Bnptist Goner
al Association of Virginia, nt its an?
nual meeting held lust week in Nor?
folk. Tho correspondent of the Rich?
mond Virginian reported to that pa?
per that several warnt speeches were I
made by the brethren condemning the I
course of General Funsten, and that
resolutions were adopted, providing
for tho appointment of a committee
to coll on President Wilson and lay
the mntter before him. A committee
of three wns accordingly appointed,
one of whom is the Rev. R. II. Pitt,
editor of the Religi?s Herald, of Rich?
mond.
In this connection it will bo ro
cnlled, that, during the civil war
great revivals were held among the
soldiers in camp. Instead of object?
ing the commanding officers were
urgent thnt these revivals be held as
often as possible.
There were a large number of
chaplains in the Southern army, thru
whose influence thousands of soldiers
were converted, out of which num?
ber of converts a number of men en?
tered tho ministry nnd others return?
ed homo to become useful members of
the churches.
If Genernl Funsten is correctly re?
ported, he no doubt thought he had
good cnuse, but it is nbout the first
time in history that it was ever
claimed that religion would interfere
with or was inimical to military dis?
cipline, says tho protests.
Rev. Mr. Campbell, who attended
the Baptist state convention at Nor?
folk, last week, was asked about the
matter and said he heard very little
snid about it.
The following appeared in yester?
day's Lynchburg News:
TO CARRY PROTEST HIGHER.
Dallas, Texas, Nov. 22.?Dr. J. B
Gnmbrell, corresponding secretary of
the Baptist Genernl Association in
Texas, issued a statement in reply to
what he styled "a reputed interview,"
in which Major Genernl Funston was
quoted as saying facetiously:
"If the Baptists are determined to
persist in distorting my statements,
they hnd better put their property
in the names of their wives."
Dr. Gambrell said:
" Ihave no property to hide nnd
take full responsibility for the pro?
tests of Baptists against the attitude
of General Funston concerning preach
ing to the soldiers along the Ri<:
Grande."
After referring to his visit to south?
ern department headquarters at San
Antonio lost summer, during which
he sought permission for Bnptist min
isters to conduct revivals at the bor
? ? ??_,,,, nn(\ was told, he snys, that
General Funston objected to revival
at i tie camps and the soldiers being
told they were "lost," Dr. Gambrcl
continues, in pnrt:
"If President Wilson, the com?
mander in chief of the army, issued
'? * *h<* ?r?test of every Bap?
tist in tho country would be count
IG IN I A. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER
i'd out. And I go further to auy thnt
rf tho president wore to undertake to
proscribe the preaching in the army
a9 to doctrine, he would invite Im
i penchntent for violating the consti?
tution of the United States.
1 "The issue in the question which
I the Baptists are protesting all over
the country is a clear one. General
I Funston has violated the religious
'rights of the Baptists and tho soldiers
I in the army.
i "Tho short of it Is. Geaeral Fun?
ston has made a prodigious mistake
in projecting militarism into the realm
of religion. He ought to take time
to correct the mistake. Ho has had
time and does not correct it. Bap?
tists will ro higher up with their
protests. In the meantime they will
I treat him with perfect fairness."

BISHOP WILSON
DIES SUDDENLY
Distinguished Methodist Divine
Once Held A Conference in
Tnzewell?Tribute From Itev.
Mr. Platt.
Press dispatches this week tell of
the decth of Bishop Alphous \V. Wil?
son, which occurred nt his home in
Baltimore, Md., early last Tuesday
morning. He was horn in Balti?
more 82 years ago and at an early age
entered the itinerant ministry of the
Methodist church. After the divis?
ion of the church he joined the South
ern branch of Methodist nnd was elect?
ed to the Episcopacy in I88'J. Bishop
Wilson attended the last session of
the Holston conference which assem?
bled in Tazewell about twenty-two
years ago nnd ninny who heard him
sermon hero at that time still speak
of it as tho greatest they ever lis?
tened to. Itev. lt. B. Platt, Jr., pastor
of tho local church says of him: "In
the death of Bishop Wilson not only
the Methodist church, hut Christiani?
ty nt large sustains n very serious
loss. As u preacher, an eloquonl ex?
pounder of the deepest meanings of
tho principles of religion, he was
without a superior. He had the mind
of n Btntesmnn, the heart of a mar?
tyr nnd the body of a soldier. Thin
his long lifo bo performed tasks in
the promotion of tho Kingdom which
wore beyond tho powers of men with
much more than ordinary endowment.
No mnn in the church was more
widely known, none more dearly loved,
nnd his going cauls u gloom which
can be lifted only by thoughts of
tho immortality of his work and of
the Resurrection which assures eter?
nal reunion."
KNIFE MEN AND BOOT- LEG (;EUS
IN THE TOILS.
I'ocuhontns, Va., Nov. 28.
There has been a little more activity
around police headquarters for n day
or two, due, of course, lo the fact thnt.
there has boon n little more activity
among tho offenders. A shooting on
Church Street Sunday afternoon caus?
ed the police to bo suspicious that
there was something wrong in that,
part of town, but no one was hit. A
colored woman was shooting at a man
both with her tongue and Ute pistol,
the former being much more ac-l
tive of the two. And it was not both
blessing und cursing that was com?
ing out of the same mouth, but only
curving nnd obscene lnnguugo.
At Thnxton's while the police were
investigating, William Thnxlon was
seen coming up from tho bottom
floor with n sack, which he promptly
bid from view when ho saw the po?
liceman. But Tom Tinsloy told Hill
Lowe "he smelt about three mice" and
he expected to find out what was in
thnt sack, which Bill denied that he
had. Tinsloy took his flashlight and
went in the direction Bill came from
going up next to the Street in one of
the subterranean caverns, where he
then anil there found several pints of
whiskey in the aforesaid sack and af?
ter returning upstairs and looking in
toBill Thnxton's overcoat pockets he
found two larger bottles of whiskey.
So Bill was brought down und put un?
der n $500 bond for selling whiskey.
Arthur Hickman, colored, had a
pocket knife with u blade sufficiently
long lo bo interesting nnd enterpris?
ing, and he proceeded to give n dem?
onstration of its superior carving
qualities on tho body of one Oscar
Barnes, also colored. It seemed to
work all right, nt least it was thought
for a long time by the doctor thnt
Burns was down and out. It was re?
ported yesterday, however, that he
has a chance to recover. Hickman
csenped to West Virginin, but Tinsley I
and Rutherford discovered his where- I
nbouts and knocked at the door of
one Robert Connor, at Rolosvillo,
whero Hickman was supposed to bo
biding. Tinsley was informed that
Hickmnn had been there but had left
at 6 o'clock in the morning. Evident?
ly Tinsley was not so easy, for,
? hnving stntioncd Rutherford (of the
Bnldwin-Foltz ngoncy), at the bnck
door of the house, he went insido nnd
soon found Hickman tucked away in
a wardrobe. He was brought to Po
cahontns nnd locked up in jail.
Yesterday afternoon Will Tabor re?
ported to the police thnt n bunch of
negroes were having a game of crap
at Beartown. Tinsloy, Lowe, Cox
jumped in Raleigh Trigg's automobile
and were soon on the scone, much to
the discomfiture of the negroes some
of whom tried to escape; in fact about
three of them did escape, but the ofil
oers brought eleven of thorn to jail.
Brnss knucks and other implements
were found on them. One of them,
who denied being in the game and
denied having nny money, was search?
ed nnd a $10 bill and other bills were
found in tho lining of his cont.
