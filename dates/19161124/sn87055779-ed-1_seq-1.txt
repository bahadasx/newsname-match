the railroads out of politics." was
the demand voiced by Alfred P.
Thorn, general counsel for the ad
visory committee of railroad execu
tive."? as ho continued his opening
statement for the railroads today
before the joint congressional com
mittee Investigating interstate com
merce conditions. The railroad law
yer asserted that while the railroads
themselves had been reformed. " so
far as participation in political elec

under "political management"
"The big railroad problem con
fronting this coimtry.'' he said, "will
never be solved until these great
transportation facilities, essentially
business organizations, are removed
from the realm of politics, and reg
ulated on sound business principles.
It cannot be solved while conditions
allow any politician to base his
whole public life on a reputation for
fighting railroads."
The railroad argument for reform
in the present sstem of railroad
regulation was continued and elab
orated by Mr. Thorn. lie pointed
out that not only were the railroads
regulated from a political viewpoint
by political organizations, but that
there were 4'.i separate government
agencies in the various states, and
the federal government itself, each
prescribing a different standard of
conduct for the roads.

it is easy to see that they will be

the rest of their lives. No one with

International News Service:
LONDON, Nov. 24. Dissension is
again rife in the Pritish cabinet.
There are strong indications that
a powerful political faction is about
to attain a coup by which it hopes
to oust Premier Asquith and put
War Seo'y David Lloyd-Oeorge in
his place.
The parliamentary correspondent
of the raily Chronicle had the fol
lowing to say about the situation:
"Rumors are flying about of a.i
impending reconstruction of the
government. They seem to spring
from a state of mind rather than
from real ty, but it is undeniable
that the house of commons just now
is very critical and dissatisfied with
the government. The 'ginger groups'
point to the IJalkans and the sub
marine menace as evidence of the
government's incapacity to waxre war
with foresight and vigor. At the
other extre me the opponents of con-
seription assert that our shipping
troubles and some of the food prob
lems have been caused by the whole
sale withdrawal of men from pro
ductive employment, and that as we
enlarge the army we make inroads
into our reserve and economic
strength."
