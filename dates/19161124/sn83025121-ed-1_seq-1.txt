Seven Furious Attacks Launched

(AhmIiM rrwa fcf Tt4ani WImUm)
EL PASO, November 24 De
feated in the supreme effort
of his present campaign and with
his army scattered, Pancho Villa
is again a fugitjye, fleeing before
the pursuing cavalry of General
Trevino. Yesterday morning he
headed any army, of eevefal thou
sand men, whom he led, in an as
sault upon th? Ci.of Chihuahua.
This mqrnirig he lias only a small
baud of followers, with 'pursuing
horsemen close ontheir trail
'1"fieTa11finwdtrrlauiic'Vie7nTri Attack upon the, Carranea garrison
of tht capittU Chihuahua early
yesterday mormng, reaching the
outskirts of the city with his ini
tial drive. . ,
ATTACKS SEVFN TIMES
Seven times he led his storm
ing parties against the defences
and seven times he was driven
back, leaving dead and wounded
on the field. On the seventh re
pulse his army broke and Villa
gave the order to fall back. This
move was the signal for a sortie
in force by the Carranzistas, be
fore which the Villistas fled.
General Trevino, the Carranza
commander, was wounded early
in the afternoon, a bullet plough
ing through his scalp. He was
taken to a hospital and treated,
but refused to stay there, leaving
the hospital in time to take part
in the later fighting and the pur
suit of Villa,
VILLISTAS MOWED DOWN
The defenses of the City of Chi
huahua included a score of field
pieces, posted on the heights com
manding the approaches to the
city. Against these Villa had
nothing heavier to bring to bear
than machine guns, and the
schrapnel mowed his troops down
as they advanced to their several
attacks.
Early in the day a sortie by
the garrijU -led to the capture
of a number of prisoners, while
the pursuit last night has added
to that number very largely. The
number of dead and wounded ly
ing on the field when darkness
fell has not been estimated, but
it is certain that Villa lost heavily,
the ground being strew with the
fallen.
The attack of the bandit force
began at eleven o'clock on the
fortifications south and southwest
of the city. General Trevino, de
ending the city, replied with his
artillery. The noise of bursting
shels in the region of the battle
was deafening, say reports reach
ing here from the unbattled city.
Trevino had twenty field pieces
