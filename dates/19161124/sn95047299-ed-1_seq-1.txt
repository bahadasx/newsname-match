Arrangements have been completed
with Col. II. M. de Montmollin where
by the Southern Utilities Company
i' Jacksonville has acquired 77 feet
f rentage n Water street next north
of the Griffin building, a part of die
Martin Gni'i. homestead. In? is a
trade whi h has been hanging f.rc for
some woi, , but which was cl wen :v a
manner satisfactory to all parties can
cel ned only within the past few days.
The lot secured by the Southern
Utilities Company extends back 85
feet toward the river, but does not in
clude the water front, which still re
mains in possession of Col. de Mont
mollin. Jt is gratifying to note that the
business men of Palatka generally
got behnd Col. de Montmollin when it
was made known that he was nego
tiating this deal and gave him valua
ble assistance.
W hat it means to Palatka is much.
The Southern Utilities Company
with headquarters in Jacksonville, is
doing business in all parts of Georgia
and Florida. The company owns val
uable franchises for electric lighting
in many cities of these states. The
company owns the Palatka franchise,
originally given to the old Palatka
Gas Light iVr Fuel Company, which it
purchased about a year ago.
It is the purpose of the company to
move its headquarters from Jackson
ville to Palatka, and to this end it has
secured this property in the down
town secton.
It is also the purpose of the com
pany to immediately begin the erec
tion of a three story brick, fire proof
building, with basement. The build
ing will be size 48 x 70 feet, and will
be both imposing and ornamental. II.
G. Perring of Jacksonville is the arch
itect. The building is to cost about
$0.000.
For some time past the company
has used the old ice factory for stor
ing its great volume of supplies. It
was found that Palatka afforded the
very best shipping facilities and
freight rates. When the new build
ing is completed the basement will be
utilized for storage purposes. The
entire building will be occupied by the
company, and its general offices will
He here.
The coming of the Southern Utili
ties Company to Palatka means that
fifteen families will come here to live,
in all about -10 persons. These peo
ple will need to find homes.
The coming of this company with
its officers and staff to Palatka to
make this city headquarters, is the
most important event commercially
and socially to take place in several
years. One can hardly realize what
a difference it will add to the commer
cial aspect of the city, and what a con
tinuous line of managers and employ
es from the various cities where the
company is operating will be coming
and going to Palatka because of this
citv's being headquarters.
And it should lie remembered that
much of the credit for this enterprise
is due to Palatka's transportation fa
cilities the fact that it is on navi-
craMO water aim is a lamuuu whlw.
Hv pressing these advantages
the
entlemcn who assisted in promoting
I the location of this company were
wise.
And there are others.
Reorganized Bridge Club.
The club formerly known as the
West End Bridge Club, which suspend
ed for the summer months has reor

Palatka's streets and hotels have
been filled all this week with repre
sentative farmers of the nation, gath
ered to attend the annual convention
of the Farmers' Educational and Co
operative Union of America.
Delegates are here from far-off Ore
gon and Washington, from Texas,
Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, Iowa;
but it is only when'you call the near
states that delegations are here in
force. The number of delegates in
attendance has been stated at be
tween 500 and 600.
President Barrett of the national
organization and President Shepard
of Florida were here a little in ad
vance of the great body of delegates,
who began straggling in groups on
Monday. Tuesday was the day of
the great influx.
On Tuesday morning one contingent
of Georgians numbered about 200.
These marched two abreast from the
Union Station to the Grand Theater,
where the opening, or welcomng ex
ercises were being held.
The big theater was packed to ca
pacity long before the opening, which
was delayed because it so happened
that all incoming trains to Palatka
were late that morning.
Gov. Trammell who was to be here
in time for the opening at 10 o'clock,
was unable to get here until 11 :30.
Senator Fletcher was also late.
Mayor Merriam made the address
of welcome for the city and his words
seemed to take hold of the visitors
and impress them as ringing true; his
honor hadn't talked long before the
visitors began to feel at home. He
told the vistors many important
things regarding Florida, Putnam
county and Palatka, particularly of
the latter, and told them not to hesi
tate a moment when they wanted in
formation, but to ask any Palatkan.
Hon. S. M. Rhodes, president of the
Tennessee State Farmers' Union re
sponded to the Mayor's address of
welcome, and following that gentle
man came an address on Co-operation
by Mr. Bradford Kneff.
Gov. Trammell arrived at this
juncture and was piloted to the stage,
where he was next introduced amid a
thunder of applause, and gave a hear
tv address of welcome in behalf of
Florida.
Senator D. U. Fletcher followed
Gov. Trammell, and after a few words
of welcome, launched into an address
in behalf of rural credits.
The senator was at his best, and
handled his subject in a masterly
manner. Stating in his introduction,
that the farmer and the cause of ag
riculture had not had adequate jus
tice done to them in the past, but
rather that they had been discrimi
nated against in the interests of com
mercial and business men and enter
prises, he proceeded to very clearly
outline the working of the Farm Loan
Act, which, he stated, would bring
immense relief to the farming indus
try, and tend to its greatest develop
ment. He stated also that the pres
ent indebtedness of the farmers of the
United States amounted to something
like $0 for every minute of the Chris
tian era, and that the amount paid
annually in interest alone on the in
debtedness was about 600 million
dollars. This, he stated, the act aim
ed to reduce by at least one-half,
while at the same time it made it
possible for farmers to liquidate their
debt by easy annual or semi-annual
instalments. Our readers are al
ready familiar with the methods by
which Farm Loan Association will
accomplish these desirable ends, so
nothing further along that line need
be written. He concluded by saying
that hitherto the farmer had been
"playing the other fellow's game" but
the time had come when he could play
his own game, and win the profits for
himself. The senator's speech was
listened to most attentively by the
srreat audence. and he was heartily
applauded as he resumed his seat.
The meetings of the Union are
held behind closed doors at the court
house and took up much of the first
afternoon, Wednesday evening and
Thursday.
Ocala has a delegation of its board
of trade here composed of some of the
city's leading business men, who are
making an effort to secure next year's
convention for that city.
Today it is thought a large num
ber of the delegates will go to Orange
Springs to attend the Colonist's Fair
given under the auspices of the Flori
da Farms & Homes, Inc.
Have you noticed the brilliant light
in front of the G. Loper Bailey Co.
office? That light is 1.500 candle
power. Makes some of the street
lamps look feeble.
Too much praise cannot be given
the board of trade committee charged
with handling the big crowd of visit
ors attending the Farmers' Conven
tion this week. Of course the hotels
were overflowing and many had to be
accommodated with rooms in private
homes, but everything went without
a hitch and every person was placed
in comfortable quarters. The main
committee was composed of Mayor
Merriam, II. F. Leeks and Mr. Walsh.
The sub-committees also are due their
full share of praise, especially the
committee on decorations and amusements.
Wednesday was picnic day at the
Farmers' Convention. And according
to arrangements the visiting dele
gates were all given a steamer ride
25 miles up the river to pretty, live
oak shaded Welaka, where they were
the guests of the good people of that
I own for the day.
The trip was made on the steamer
Clivedon of the Beach & Miller Line,
and as the boat pulled out from the
dock in the morning just as the sun
was dispersing the thick mists, it was
a happy crowd that filled her decks.
A colored orchestra made music on
the main deck and those Georgia boys
had a hard time to keep their feet
still. When the string band ceased
the newly ormed cornet band under
the uirecticn of Prof. Seger struck
up lively airs. To many of the visit
ors a steaml oat ride was a new pleas
ure and one that they enjoyed to the
lull.
Welaka is on the east bank of the
river, seme 25 n-.des above Palatka
The town is situated on a high bank
and is beautifully shaded with wide'
spreading live oak. On arrival the
visitors were met by the 'town's peo
ple and e.-cortcd to the park, where
tables and a speakers stand had been
erected. litre before the serving of
dinner, a i umber ot addresses were
made.
Mayor Frank E. Reeder, who was
ill and unable to make the address of
welcome, was represented by Rev. W
P. Trouimaii, who in a few cordial
words of welcome put the visitors at
ease. His address was followed by
others from repreesntative visitors,
including Hon..W. A. Bowen of Paris,
Texas, editor of the Farmers -r ire
side Bulletin, Hon. W. P. Young, ag
ricultural agent of the Southern Pa
cific Railraw; Hon. W. C. Langdon
of Kansas, and a late candidate for
governor; J. J. Brown of Georgia and
others. These addresses were all
bright and filled with interest both
for the people of the town and the
delegates.
The barbecued dnner followed,
served on long tables spread under
the oaks. The menu consisted of
beef, pork, fish chowder, bread, pick
les, hot coffee, etc., followed with an
abundance of fresh oranges, tange
rines and grapefruit.
The people of Welaka were the soul
of hospitality; the visitors, many of
whom had never seen an orange
grove, were permitted to go through
them at will and pick what fruit they
wanted, and hundreds of them accept
ed the invitation. The day was one
of unalloyed pleasure to all the dele
gates and the experience novel in its
every feature.
Mr. Bowen in his address referred
glowingly to the river trip and de
clared that "the upper reaches of the
St. Johns for scenic beauty and classic
picturesqueness could not be supass
ed by any river in the world, and he
had traversed all the famous water
courses both at home and abroad."
The party returned to Palatka just
at dusk. More than fifty of the re
turning excursionsts told The News
that nothing in the way of pleasure
could Have been provided that could
have taken the place of the river trip
to Welaka. "We will always remem
ber little Welaka," said one enthu
siastic matron.
The dinner was supurb. It was
barbecued as only an artist like Ju
lus Neubeck knows how. Mr. Neu
beck went up on Tuesday and did tlu
work.
Many visitors also made the trip
to Welaka in autos, thereby having
opportunity to view the big camphor
farm.
Mrs. Neck Meets Sudden Death.
The sudden death of Mrs. R. E.
Neck at her home on Sunday morning
brought gloom to many households,
for the lady was highly esetemed and
had a large circle of friends. The sud
denness of her going was appalling.
Mrs. Neck had been in her usual
health and with her husband had just
returned from an auto ride.
Soon after returning to her home
she complained of her head feeling
bad, fell into her husband's arms and
expired. A physician was summoned,
but too late. Her death was instan
taneous. Mrs. Neck was a natve of Palatka,
where she was born some thirty-three
years ago. She was a daughter of
the late John Grooms. She was a
member of the Pythian Sisters and
the Order of the Eastern Star, and
had extensive social connections. A
lady of charming manners and kindly
disposition she cemented strong
friendships. Her unexpected death
cast a gloom over the community.
Besides her devoted husband, Mrs.
Neck is survived by her mother, Mrs.
S. J. Reynolds, two sisters, Mrs. Ken
nedy and Mr-.. Austin, and two bro
thers, John J., and Alonzo B. Grooms,
all living in this city.
The funeral arrangements were in
the hands of Mooney & Davis, and the
obswiuies were held from her mother's
home on Dodge street Monday after
noon, being conducted by Rev. S.
Grady of the Methodist church, her
pastor. The interment was in West
View cemetery, the service at the
grave beng conducted by the frater
nal organzations to which she belonged.
The new Atlantic & Gulf Insurance
Company building for which ground
was cleared last week on Second
street next south of the East Florida
Savings & Trust Co's Bank, is to be
erected immediately.
The contract has been let to Buck
land & Fitchner of Jacksonville, the
same firm which only some three
weeks ago completed the new Hotel
James.
The new building is to be 50 feet
front by 90 feet deep, will be two
stories high and will have a front of
pressed brick and terra cotta orna
ment. The up-stairs rooms will be
divided into offices.
G. Loper Bailey & Co. will occupy
the ground floor offices next to the
bank, and this room will have a width
of 28 feet. Mr. Bailey has decided
on plans which will give him one of
the handsomest, best fitted insurance
offices in the state.
The south ground floor office will
be to rent.
It was expected that ground would
be broken by the contractors on Mon
day, so it is only a matter of a day or
two when the buildng is under way.
FAIRJPENS TODAY
Fine Exhibits Have Been
Arranged for Visitors.
If the weather proves good today
and tomorrow it is expected that a
large number will go from this city
and other parts of the county to at
tend the Colonists Fair at Orange
Springs.
This Fair is chiefly to show the
products of the lands of the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc., and Col. Jas.
R. Murphy and his staff of assistants
have been unspairing in their efforts
to mak': the exhibit one or real worth."
1 he Ocklawaha Valley railroad is
making a round trip rate from Palatka
to Orange Springs to all who desire
to attend the Fair. Orange Springs
is a beautiful rlace one of the nat
ural fceauty ?pots of Florida, and no
one will regret making the trip. Ad-
missior. to the I' air is said to be free.
A large number of the delegates to
the convention are planning to re
main over for the day to attend this
exhibit, and The News is assured that
they will see much to make the trip
memorable.
