IT'S ALL OVER NOV
HUGHES WIRES CONGRATULA
TIONS TO WILSON.
Official Count In California Shows
Victory For All of 13 Demo
cratic Electors
Lakewood, N. J., November 22.
Charles E. Hughes this evening con
ceded the re-election of President
Wilson. The Republican nominee for
President was advised late today
that the official canvass of votes in
California was completed and that
Wilson had carried the state by a
safe margin. He then wrote out the
following telegram:
"The President,
"The White House, Washington, D. C.
"Because of the closeness of the
"vote I have awaited the official count
in California, and, now that it is vir
tually completed, permit me to ex
tend to you my congratulations upon
your re-election.
"I desire also to express my best
wishes for a most successful admin
istration. Charles. E. Hughes."
William R. Wilcox, Chairman of
the Republican National Committee,
this evening issued the following
statement from the headquarters,
Fifth avenue and Forty-second street
New York City:
"Having conferred by telephone
during the day and late this after
noon with the Republican State Com
mitteemen and the Republican Na
tional Committeemen of California,
I am informed that the official can
vass of the vote has been so nearly
completed that no change will re
sult from the few precincts not
counted in the returns thus far com
piled. "This means that the majorities for
the Wilson Electors in California
range from 1,200 to 3,800 and that
this is the final message for which
we have been waiting. As far as any
recount is concerned, the National
Committee is not advised of suffi
cient grounds to call for such an ap
plication." Republican leaders decided todav
there was no necessity for demand
ing a recount. They gave up the last
faintjiope they had held when they
"met in conference and received in
formation by telephone from San
Fi-anciseo that the canvass was about
completed.
Charles B. Warren, of Michigan;
Theodore E. Burton and James R.
Garfield, of Ohio and Mr. Wilcox,
Herbert Pai-sons and George W. Per
Icins, of New York, were in the con
ference. The party leaders in many
states have been urging the managers
to concede the election, it was learn
ed. California Safe.
Careful checking of all pi'ecincts
in California shows there is no possi
bility of President Wilson losing Cal
ifornia, according to the announce
ment by the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. The committee's
checking shows thjowest iJemoaticejghcd a ttS -i-,d3muS

in wheat, has judiciously invested his !
pronis in some line uiue grass larms
mostlv in Mercer county. He bought
the Wm. Spilman farm of 400 acres
at S150 per acre. Mr. Caddell pur-cased-the
Dr. T. 0. Meredith farm of

Flour Extinguishes Fire
When It Seemed That George H.
Farris' Grocery Was Doomed
Flour proved that in some cases it
is as efficacious as water as a fire
extinguisher Wednesday night about
seven o'clock when the acetylene gas
tank at the grocery store of George
H. Farris at the corner of Main and
Somerset streets took fire. The blaze
began spreading quickly, and efforts
to extinguish it with water and then
smothered it with sacking and blak
ets proved unavailing. Mr. Farris
shouted to John Bright to grab the
books and get out, thinking there was
little chance to extinguish the blaze
before arrival of the fire department.
The cry of fire, however, quickly
brought many in to see what help
they could give. Joe T. Embry, the
well known high school student and
foot ball star, was among the first in,
and it was his quick suggestion that
sacks of flour be cut open and thrown
upon the blaze that saved the day. A
force of men began pouring flour
onto the blaze and within a few min
utes it was successfully smothered
and put out, and a very disastrous
conflagration prevented. Mr. Fai-ris
says his damage will not amount to
over $25 probably. He carries $4,000
insurance on his stock, which he says,
would not nearly have covered the
loss at present, and he has in an ex
tra large stock of Thanksgiving and
Christmas goods.
$10,000 Worth of Turks
Slaughtered Here for Thanksgiving
Market by Local Firm
Northcott and Tudor, of this citv,
have bought over $10,000 worth of
turkeys, delivered at Stanford ior
the Thanksgiving market, and are
dressing them and loading them into
fast freight cars for shipment to the
eastern market. Mr. Tudor, Charley
Pendleton and others have been keep
ing guard at the turkey pens with
loaded weapons each night, to pre
vent any theft of the very valuable
cargoes. "Turkey Tom" Gooch, of
McKinney, has been doing most of
the buying and delivering of the
fowls to Stanford. He has deliveerd
4,000 so far, which, he says will aver
age 13 pounds to the bird, and as the
price has averaged 20 cents a pound,
it can readily be seen that the hand
some figure of $10,400 has been
paid to turkey raisers in this section
of the county within the past few
weeks. It is hard to obtain an esti-
mate of how many have been sold in
other parts of the county, but the
Thanksgiving business in Lincoln
will easily approximate $15,000, while
the Christmas business will be half
or two-thirds of that amount.
As usual the largest check given
by Mr. Gooch for birds was to Miss
Mary North, who has gained the rec
ord as the champion turkey raiser of
Lincoln county by always delivering
the largest number each year. She,

of 30 indictments into court for
crimes ranging from murder down.
Only one murder indictment was
brought, it being against John Baker,
who killed Renzo King with a corn
knife at Moreland some weeks ago.
The trial of Baker was set for the
second day of the February term of
court. He is in jail here. Other- in
dictments returned by the grand jury
were: two for rape; four for having
liquor in possession for purpose of
sale; two for disturbing religious
worship; three for assault and bat
tery; two for conducting a public
nuisance; two for petit larceny; two
for maintaining a public nuisance;

E. C. Wal
ton, Foreman, Nov. 21, 1916.
An interesting and unusual pro
ceeding was taken by the court when
the judgment of 1 cent and costs as
sessed against M. S. Baughman by a
jury last week, on a charge of having
his fence too far out on the pike, was
set aside and the ease thrown out of
court, when it was shown that there
was
no indictment ajrainst him on
such a charge, and that the trial had
been gone into upon the mistaken I
supposition that he had been indicted
along with others by the
-- . , , .
previous
grand jury on this charge. J. B. Hon
aker foreman of the grand jury which
brought in a number of "fence" in
dictments at a previous term of
court, went before the court and tes
tified that no indictment had been
bi-ought in against
Mr. Baughman,
fas did Wes Ho
ltzclaw, clerk of the
grand jury, and did W. P. Dishon, a
member of that grand jury.
A $9,000 judgment against the

Will Mean A Fortune I
If Hemp Breaking Machine Invented
By Local Men Makes Good
Hemp breaking machines are be
coming such an important item of the
equipment of every farmer who
raises hemp in Lincoln county that
two of Lincoln county's most suc
cessful young hemp men have invent
ed and patented a hemp breaking ma
chine of their own. They are Sam
Holtzclaw and his brother, Wesley
Holtzclaw, who this week received
patents, on a breaking machine they
have been working on for sometime.
They applied for patents last April
and are greatly pleased at securing
the papers protecting them in their
invention, which, they say, tests have
proven to be superior to anything on
the market, and a successful hemp
breaking machine has so far been
one of the long-sought-for goals of
all inventors.
Josh B. Jones, one of the biggest
hemp growers in this section of the
state, this week got in from Win
chester, a Skinner hemp breaking
machine. This machine is also a new
invention. It is operated by a gaso
line engine, and breaks on each side.
The Holtzclaw boys say that if the
Skinner machine is a success theirs
will be a great deal more so for they
say their machine will break six times
as much hemp in a given time as the
Skinner machine. If their machine
will do what they believe it will and
it will be given exhaustive tests this
season, these well known local young
men have a fortune easily in their
grasp.

tion. both Perry and Kidd stand in
grave danger of the electric chair,
and if what is said about them is
true, they richly deserve it.
Robert Padgett is an aged farmer
j about 65 years old, and said to be in
feeble health. His wife is some years
his junior, perhaps 45 years of age;
she is also in delicate health both
mentally and physically, and has
been a partial invalid for some time.
On the night they name, they say
that the Perry and Kidd men came
to their house, drunk, broke into the
dwelling and, threatening death to
the aged husband if he interferred,
both men attacked Mrs. Padgett. An
other witness is said to have told the
grand jury that before going to tho
home of the Padgetts, one of the two
men charged
with the assault told
what he was going to do, and was
urged not to do such a thing, but be
ing drunk at the time, paid no at
tention to the warning, and went
ahead with the dastardly deed.
Both Kidd and Perry are said to
have left that section, and their
whereabouts are unknown at present.
Both are men of family. Their wives
and friends are understood to vigor
ously deny that they committed any
such awful crime, such as they are
charged with, and the wife of one is
said to have sent word to Mrs. Pad
eett, warning her against telling
"any such lie as that" on her hus
band. The whole affair is a horrible and
almost unbelievable. It is expected
