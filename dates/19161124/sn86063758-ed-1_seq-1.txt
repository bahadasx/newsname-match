.and the same good feeling that has
-dominated the campaign since its in..-v^ception
still exists. The good n3^r-:

Good Work.
Extremely good wor". has been done
by most of the candidates from th<?,
^beginning. I
All are doing their level best to
^ outdo their competitors within the
next week. They are leaving no "turn
unstoned and no stone unturned" to
I secure every subscription possible,
and as a result thousands of votes
^ will be aded to ear;U candidate's totals.
The list in today's paper shows
^h^that a determined effort is being put
Bptorth by each and every candidate to
break all past records in securing
W subscriptions and everyone realizes
" that they must have votes in order to
secure the valuable prizes, and a hard
fought fight is expected. j

Hard, earnest work must be done during
ing the remaining days and as the
ambitious candidates appreciate the
W high value .of the prizes at stake they
are not gpjng to allow them to go to
? a competitor without a struggle.
Those candidates who made exception-!
al gains last week, will, of course,
K continue their splendid work now that

their goal is aooui 10 ue reaciieu.
eryone appreciates the fact that the
reward to be gained for all past efforts
depends upon the effort put
forth and the result obtained during
the last stages of the campaign.
Candidates: Tli? prizes are still be-i
fnre vou to be won. in .fact, they are!
just as far from being won as they
were when the campaign was first
announced. A little extra effort on j
the part of any of the energetic candidates
may. perhaps, turn the tables
entirely. Just who will secure the
prizes is the main thought of the hour,
and as the campaign draws near its
end, the interest, of course, increases.
Many inquiries are riede each (lay!
as to just how this candidate or that j
candidate stands, and whether or not j
she has a chance for the Maxwell j
Touring Car or one of the other splen- i
did prizes. Votes, of course, will be
the deciding factors in determining
who the winners will be and votes
must be had and they are only issued
on subscriptions secured by each candidate.
Eight D?us More.
A little more than eight days remain
in which to jecure subscriptions
and votes. If you are a candidate
who aspirrs to secure any one 01 me
prizes this question is asked you directly:
"What will these eight days
means to you?" They will mean the
Maxwell Touring Car and five other
prizes besides and cash awards which
wil go to the ener-5::?i.\ Secu ring any
of the rich prizes will be a viftorv
indeed, but, the greatest victory will
arise fn winning the best prizes. Joy
will reign suprvmo!1/ ir. the ramps of J
the successful. Do not overlook an
fo jejure a subscription,}
vv?
but redouble your efforts and finish I
with colors flying. The present indications
are,, the race will be a very
close one* especially for the greatest
prizes, and a few more votes and subscriptions
than you intended to get
may prove of tremendous value to
you.
But now is the time to get them.
It will be too late after Saturday, December
2nd.

Fire in the Country,
The residence of Mr. Marcus B.
Hendrix near Trinity was completely
^frnvo/1 hv fire Tuesdav morning at
uvww* v v? J M. ? ? m
9 o'clock. Mr. Hendrix was on the
farm away from the house when the
fire was discovered. It came from a
closet and as Mrs. Hendrix threw a
busket of water on the flames she
was burned about the hand and arm
and had her hair singed, but was not
seriously injured. Everything in the
was'destroyed, save a very few
small articles. The loss is about $1,;>vu
with no incurance. Among the
things burned were seven barrels of
new home-raised flour and the meat
of a big hog just killed. The fire is
supposed to have originated from a
rat gnawing a match.

Pomaria, Nov. 22.?Pastor Ballentine
is kept busy these Sunday afternoons
speaking the words that unite
two hearts to beat as one. On Sunday,
November 12, at 5 o'clock Mr.
Ernest Graham and Miss Eunice Rinwr
drove to the Darsonaso where
they were made man and wife. Mrs.
Graham is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert G. Ringer. Mr. Graham
is a son of Mr. W. B. Graham.
At the parsonage on the same afternoon
Pastor Ballentine married
Mr. Eddie Wicker and Miss Belle
Lominick. Mrs. Wicker is the daughter
of Mr. W. B. Lominick and Mr.
Wicker is the son Of Mr. D. T. 'Wicker.
Both these young men are prosperous
farmers of this section. The
young ladies are also from tnis ction
and have many friends who ie'i
them mighty well.
On the 10th of this month we had an t
invitation to Jolly Street where we:
were told that the people of that com- j
rnunity would serve supper in appre- j
ciation of the fine work done by the j
chain gang in that section. We under-!
stood the supper was being given iu j
honor of Supervisor Sample, Capt. |
? ? * i
Miller and Mr. Tom Kicnarason wnu
know just what it takes to make a
good road and of course we were anx- j
ious to attend. When we reached the;
place with several of our Pomaria
friends we found about sixty-five;
friends who had been invited to help;
enjoy the feast. There was 'possum j
with smiling potatoes, barbecue pork,;
kid, hash, pickles and so on. Thej
r~eats were fine and had that pecu-j
liar flavor which compels any one to j
ask for more even when he knows he!
has enough. After supper had been j
^ - 1 <2?_ ,
served at tlie request 01 me uuvs ,
porvisor Sample, Sheriff Cannon j
Blease, Hons. W. B. Boinest and H. |
H. Evans made short speeches. The j
occasion was a very pleasant one and i
pne that shall long be remembered. I
The roads in and around here are l
put in the best condition they have j
even been. We cannot be too grate-1
ftii to Mr. Sample and Messrs. Miller'
and Cameron who have charge of the I
gang and who are doing everything J
possible for the best interests of the j
county. We must also mention Mr. j
J. J. Epting who kindly gave dirt of j
his own free will and accord for a j
forty foot fill to be built near his
home, and which adds so much to the
i mu? niona hPAn needing j
ru, x iic ww*
attention for some time. The bridge
used heretofore was about 12 feet
wide. The road coming in from St.
Pauls and the road from Jolly Street
interesct on the bridge and it was
impossible for any one coming down
the steep hill to the bridge to see
more than a few yards ahead wiiicn

can now pass and feel safe, n we I
bad more men like Mr. Epting who
would open their hearts and help the
county by giving new roadbeds and
roads about to be widened *^nd so on
we would have much better roads and
less complaining.
iWihile returning home from Colum'
bia on Friday night Mr. H. F. Counts
