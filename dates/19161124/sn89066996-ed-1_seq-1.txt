county and in the lower part of Pike
county, were biding their time. Other
companies were organized in Pike,
Lincoln, St. Charles and adjoining
counties.
Such an array of fighting men of
course could not be kept entirely
nuiet and secluded, and it was gen
erally known that Captain Jamison,
who was as fearless as he was dar
ing, was associated with this quietly
waiting organization of prospective
Southern soldiers. Persistent efforts
were made by the Union forces to
get hold of him. He was kept busy

steamboat there to take us across the

in time to receive our baptism of
fire.
Here Captain Jamison was taken ill
had hemorrhage of the lungs and
was forced to return home, where he
was taken prisoner. Subsequently
he and Miss Jacoby were married.
The writer never met him again un
til the close of the civil war. After
the war he continued to live in
Clarksville and became editor and
publisher of the Clarksville Sentinel.
In 1884 he was a warm supporter of
the nomination and election of Gov
ernor Marmaduke, who appointed him
Adjutant General. At the close of
his term of office he removed with his
family to Guthrie, Oklahoma.
Captain Jamison was a brave,
warm-hearted and generous gentle
manone of nature's noblemen.
Though ripe in years, and in the
course of nature he could not have
survived but a few years more at
most, the news of his death is re
ceived with regret by all who knew
him and pleasant memories of him
are revived. Peace to his soul.

HOG KN MILLER HUBER
The marriage of Mr. Fred Hogen
miller to Miss Annie Huber occurred
Tuesday night, at the home of the
bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Huber, at Weingarten, about fifteen
miles east of Farmington. It was a
splendid social affair, and many guests
were in attendance. The ceremony
was followed with a splendid supper,
to which all did full justice, and yet
enough good things remained to feed
a multitude. An enjoyable dance fol
lowed. Both contracting parties belong to
excellent old German families of that
community. The groom is known as
one of the most energetic and suc
cessful young men of Ste. Genevieve
county. The bride is one of the most
popular and accomplished young la
dies in that community. She is a
graduate of the Ozark Business Col
lege, of this city, and popular with all
who know her.
Among the guests from this city
were: Mrs. B. J. Robinson, Miss
Byrd Watts. Miss Ruby McBride Will
Overall, Homer Carver and Henry
Cleve.
Messrs. W M. Harlan, W, J. Bru
ett, W. E. Matkin, W. A. Gardner, A

Granite for
Road Surfacing
The writer was out motoring last
Sunday afternoon with an observant
friend who i3 familiar with road con
ditions all over the county. Passing
over Stono and along the road to Iron
Mountain, the wealth of granite stone
is very noticeable. "What a pity,"
he remarked, "that our County Court
can't see the wisdom and economy of
crushing this granite and surfacing
our roads with it, instead of iho rot
ten lime stone that is being used for
this purpose and which is continually
being ground to dust and swept away
by wind and rain, so that the roads
are continually needing patching up
an expensive proceeding in the long
run. This granite would make roads
that would last and cost little to keep
up."
We were impressed with the sug
gestion, and were told that he had
more than once urged this matter on
the County Court, but that that body
had so far taken no action upon the
suggestion. Whether this is because
of Borne idea of false economy and
that it would add too much to the
cost of road building because of the
distance the material woi!d have to
be hauled to some points, we do not
know. Of course the cost would be a
little greater, but when the advantages
to be obtained, the solidity and per
manency of the roads are taken into
consideration, would it not be econ
omy in the long run?
But Stono and the long stretch be
tween Doe Run and Iron Mountain are
not the only places in the county rich
in granite formation. Splendid gran
ite quarries are also to be found all
around Knob Lick. Not knowing
much about what would make good
roari material, we suggested to our
friend that the hardness of granite
and the rough edges of the material
would increase the wear and tear of
vehicles, and especially of the rubber
tires of motor cars. But that, accord
ing to his theory, would bo no greater
than results from crushed lime stone,
and that it would soon become so
compact and smooth as to sweep
aside such objection.
Why should our County Court and
Highway Engineer not take up this
question and give it due considera
tion. In constructing roads we
should mnke them as good and lasting
as possible, for therein lies the true
economy of road building. Any ad
dition in cost might be made up in
saving in other directions. Com
plaints have come to us of road work
that strikes us as wastelul. we are
told Uiat. frequently long stretchy of
roads are nicely graded and then left
without hard surrace finishing the
money runs out perhaps and the
rains and heavy hauling over tne
fresh grades cut them up so badly
that much of the work must be done
over again before they are finished.
Close calculation should be made of
the money available for the improve
ment of any piece of road as to how
far it will go to complete the work,
so that when the grading is done the
hard surface finishing may be put on
as soon as the grading is sufficiently
rolled and settled to admit of it.
Hotels Agree to
Raise Rates
A' meeting of hotel proprietors of
St. Francois county was held last
Saturday in Flat River, for the pur
pose of considering the question of a
raise in hotel rates throughout this
countv, and an agreement was entered
into to raise the rates from $2.00 to
S2.fi0 per dav. owing to the continued
advance of practically everything that
goes to make up hotel fare and ser
vice. All present were agreed the
raise that was decided on is the only
way in which they could keep up
their menu to its present standard.
The Times has been informed that
some drummers are objecting to the
raise in the price of board. Of all
people who patronize hotels, it oc
curs to us that traveling men should
be the very last to enter such an ob
jection. On their ability to sell goods
depends their salary, and they must
sell goods in order to draw pay. It
is these same goods, too, very large
ly, that the hotel man must buy,
which these same traveling men have
sold to their customers at greatly in
creased prices. If the" traveling men
have any reason for complaint at the
action of the hotel men, in raising
their rates, then they should carry
such complaints back to the wholesale
houses they represent, and have them
remedy the wrong, if there is any
wrong in the premises.
FINE SERVICE AT INFIRMARY
The Epworth League of the M. E.
Church. South, conducted their regu
lar monthly service at the County In
firmary last Sunday afternoon, en
joyable features of which were spe
cial music by the junior choir and the
Sunday school quartet of boys, and
an address by B. H. Marbury. The
inmates especially were delighted
and plainly showed their apprecia
tion and enjoyment. Mr. Marbury is
well known as a finished speaker, and
his address on this occasion is most
highly spoken of as one of his best
efforts.
A program will be rendered in the
Methodist Church at Bismarck, on
Monday afternoon and night, Nov.
87th, under the auspices of the St.
Fratreois County Church Extension
Society. Able speakers, from differ
ent parts of the conuty, will be in at
tendance and will address the meeting.
Telephone Company
Judging from the many commenda
tions The Times has received on the
publication of the petition to the
State Board of Public Utilities, to
gether with this paper's comment, in
which was suggested that the Board
would do well to investigate the ser
vice that is being rendered in Farm
ington by the telephone company, to
gether with the antiquated equipment
with which they ure attempting to
render service, for which they are re
ceiving "top of the market" prices,
our suggestions were right in line with
the public demands. While "That's
bully," "It was fine", "That's what we
need," "Go to it, we're behind you,"
and similar encouraging expressions
have been numerous, not a single crit
icism of the course The Times is pur
suing in this matter has reached us.
With such a hearty and unanimous
approval of its course, The Times
would indeed be selfish find unappre
ciative of its friends and supporters
if it should now diver its attention
from the somewhat musty subject of
a wholly inefficient telephone service
with which Farmington has been al
ready entirely too long. Neither is it
our disposition to quit, so long as we
have right and justice on our side, as
evidenced by the approval of the gen
eral public. This fight is just now
starting, insofar as The Times is con
cerned, unless speedy refief is of
fered, which we believe will come
when the Public Utilities Board gets
Coal Prices are I
Sky-Rocketingi
Now that the season of the year
has arrived when it is necessary to
use fuel to temporize the wintry
blasts, the price of coal is rapidly ad
vancing. About $1.00 a ton has been
added within the past ten days, and
an upward tendency continues. The
reason given by the dealers is that
they are unable to secure the coal,
owing to the scarcity of cars. Yet,
for the past several months coal for
,l.rt ..mini, Mfhifn,' nnulft VinVO hflnTl
coming in. But now, that winter is
... i : :n::,... 0
upun us, ' is mi . . .in i- ,i cup-
ply of coal in the hands of dealers to
supply even present demands, which
automatically, it seems, causes the
price to slide upward. It all seems
very strange, and yet, when one is so
unfortunate as to require the filling
up of his bin, he is immediately forced
to the jjlusian that it is neverthe
less true.
But what has become of all the
coal cars? We have not even been
told that they have been exported to
the war zone. Wc have been told that
thousands upon thousands of cars now
fill all nvailable trackage in and
about New York City, Galveston and
perhaps other seaports, loaded witn
freight, but with little or no effort be
ing made to unload them. Thus they
are removed from their natural place
as supply agents for the great Amer
ican public. But for what purpose,
do you ask? Apparently for just the
purpose that is being so well accom
plished to force up the price of ev
erything that the railroads are sup
posed to carry, and that the public
requires.
And this condition, it would seem,
is the principal cause of the enormous
advance in the cost of everything that
the public demands. Is it possible
that there is no law to compel ine
railroads to supply cars for the de
mands of the public? What, in the
name of reason and common sense,
have our law-makers been doing all
these years if they have neglected to
safe-guard the public against such a
calamity as this? Such, a general
scarcity of cars as there now appears
to be should not be permitted.' even
for a brief space of time, much less
for months. Also, it now seems plain,
that there should be a law requiring
the supply of home demands, at a
reasonable margin of profit, before
anything could be shipped abroad.
Under the system tnat now appears
to be in vogue, the people of this coun
try can be made to suffer ns much
perhaps more than the people are
suffering in the warring countries. If
there is now no protection fir Amr
ica in these things, then that is the
kind of "protection" the count v is
sorely in need of the kind wa
have. With no war in this country,
why should we be "held up" for 1 'a
prices. We must "beat back" tn the
first principles of Americanism hu
manity. A Nice Bunch

Be a Booster
For Farmington
Do you know that Farmington is
one of the VERY BEST towns, in
the BEST State in this Union? We
earnestly believe it is THE BEST lit
tle city, in the best State of the sis
terhood of States. And yet, we
would not be greatly surprised if you
hud never given this matter a serious
consideration. Then is it not high
time, don't you think, that you were
arousing yourself to the true condi
tions, environments, advantages and
opportunities offered in this communi
ty? Many communities, with nothing
like the prospects and opportunities
that are so apparent in this communi
ty, are going steadily forward with a
satisfactory and healthy growth, sim
ply because the citizens of such plac
es have come alive to the opportuni

effort to push their communities for
ward. A wide-awake, progressive cit
izenship can do wonders to ward push
ing a community, even with small
natural opportunities, into the lime
light of publicity. A live bunch can
create opportunities. It is hand-made
opportunities, very largely, on which
many prospering communities are now
very largely thriving.
While Farmington and this com
munity has as great a percentage of
first class citizens as can be found
anywhere on enrth, and many live
wires in the way of public boosters,
there is no organization or unity of
action in such matters. It is public
co-operation, of all things, that any
community stands mor.t greatly in
need of, if it is to enjoy a full meas
ure of prosperity.
That is the one thing most needed, in
Farminizton. Then other thines will
! come with apparently little or no ef
: fort. With wide-awake, skillful in-
dustry and hearty co-operation on the
part of the business men of Farming
ton, this city can soon be made to take
on new life and renewed eneriry that
will put her in the place she was evi
dently intended to fill the brightest
and most flourishing little city on the
globe." Is it worth the effort? Or,
would it really be an effort? Then
wake up and be a booster for Farm
ington. Kindle the fire and let the
light shine for the many who are con
stantly looking for just such a home
m they can make here.
Auto Accident
Last Tuesday evenin"- nhout 7
o'clock Loo Florence of Dosloge had
an automobile accident that came
near costing him hla lif. It occurred
about four miles from Farmington on
the Flat. River road, near Ed Herring
tor's. Hi." machine ran off a culvert
and was overturned, pinning him be
neath it. A hoy who was in the ma
chine was nnhurt, but his bull dog,
which the boy had with him, was
killed. Parties coming up at the time
released him from his uncomf"! table
position under the car and b-ought
him to Farmington, where his in
juries were attended to by a physi
cian. He suffereu a ecsId wound of
about 2 1-2 inches on the lop i f his
head, and his right wrist was badly
cut. He says that the headlights of
an approaching car blinded him and
caused the accident.
Let Us Give Thanks
Next Thursday, November 30th, has
bean designated by President WM-on
as Thanksgiving. Never in history
has this country nad g'-efcer cause
for heart-felt thanksgiving and
praise than it has this year. All
should return most profound thanks
that in this country peace and happi
ness prevail, and that nrosnerit' ex
tends the length and breadth of our
shores.
But, in the midst of our plenty, we
should not forget a prayer and a
thank offering for the millions of war
sufferers across the waters.
