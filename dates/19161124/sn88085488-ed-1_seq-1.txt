WAS EARLY SETTLER
lasted Present Farm Home Near
Pullman US Years Ago—Died
in Spokane
The final chapter in the life his
tory of Thomas W. Savage, early
pioneer, substantial citizen and pro
gressive farmer, was written last
Friday, when acute Bright's disease
sdded another victim to its long list
of human tolls and brought.to a close
! life that was filled with happiness,
food fellowship and industry. Lo
oting on a farm two miles west of
Pullman 38 years ago, when agri
culture in this region was in its in
fancy and Pullman as a village hart
sot been conceived, Mr. Savage bent
to his then uncertain task of digging
a livelihood out of the Palouse soil
with the determination that char
acterized his every effort and was
one of the first to point the Way for
thousands to Pullman and the Pa
louse country as one of the greatest
agricultural regions on earth.
Throughout his long years of resi
dence near Pullman Mr. Savage, add
ed daily to his list of friends through
lis companionable disposition, hon
esty and integrity; he nursed no
pudges, did no man wrong and had
do enemies.
When failing health began to sap
the energy which had made possible
•he successful, thrifty life, and after
death had called his ( helpmate of
nearly half a century, -Mr. Savage re- j
lnctantly ceased active farming, and
(or the past two or three years has
lived almost continuously in Spo
kane, where he made his home with
his daughter, Mrs. Ortis Hamilton.
Frequently, however, he made trips
It Pullman, and was always wel
comed by a horde of staunch friends,
a deserving tribute to the honor of
the esteemed pioneer. He died at
the home of Mrs. Hamilton Friday
»nd the body was shipped to Colton,
where is was laid to rest Tuesday
beside the remains of the loving wife
who preceded him to her great re
ward. The funeral, held from the
Catholic church, was largely attend
ed, many friends going from Pull
man to pay their final respects.
' Thomas Wallace Savage was born
in London, England, August 10,
1842, being 74 years of age at the
time of his death. At the age of
seven years he accompanied his par
ents to the United States and settled

illness opportunities superior to
those of New York City, he removed
'o California in 1866, settling in San
Jose, where he engaged in the breed
■ng of thoroughbred horses until
B'2, when he became proprietor of

WALTERS TO LEAD TEAM
After a season somewhat disas
trous ho far as winning percentage
was concerned, the Pullman high
school football team disbanded for
the year, electing Kenneth Walters,
quarterback, captain for next year.
The team lost the county champion
ship to Colfax for the first time In
sin years. The season's reverses may
be attributed largely to the ineligi
bility of several of the star players,
some of whom were ruled out of the
game by the faculty just prior to the
important contests because of inade
quacy in scholastic work. The play
ers who were granted the honor let
ter were Captain Mclvor, Walters,
Burgess, Nash, Kampen. George.
Meeks, Crow. Llngg, Randall. Bar
clay, and Douglas.
