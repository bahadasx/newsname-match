AUSTRIA FACES CRISIS
IN ARMY RESERVES
MILAN, Nov. 24. The Rome war
office has Issued startling informa
tion relative to the critical state of
the military reserves of the Austro-
Hungarian empire.
Up to the end of April last Austria
had called under arms, 7,400,000
n. Only 2,000,000 of these, in
cluding 300,000 still In training, are
available for during the war twenty
three "marsohformatlonen" each of
which average 215.000 men, making
a total of nearly 5,000,000 marching
reserve troops have been drawn up
on to fill gups left in the armies in
(he flel.
About 00,000 of these are men
who have returned to the ranks after
a period of convalescence, so that the
enormous difference of 4,400.000 men
represents the Austro-Hungarlan
wastage In killed, permanently dis
abled, prisoners and missing.
Austria Is now, therefore, faced
with the crucial Indeed, Insoluble
problem of forming fresh reserves.

foreign countries have contracted to
purchase two hundred million bush
els of American wheat.
The resolution said, "Flour has
reached a higher price than at any
time since the civil war. All other
staples are advancing proportionately,
it is rapidly becoming impossible-for a
great portion of working people to ob
