ALL-DAY CONFERENCE
TURNS OUT IN VAIN
Hagerman, Worn Out After
Long Struggle, Promises
"News Tomorrow."
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 21.
Fro:n 9 o'clock this morning to 6
o'clock tonight counsel for the federal
government and counsel for the rail
roads remained In deadlock as to a
test cuse for tie Adnmson law.
They went to bed with the situation
unchanged, but with formal expres
sion of hope that an agreement could
be announced to mo i low morning.
The Injunction ease of the Atchison,
Topeka ik Santa ! was tt have c.une
up before Judge Pollock on the Kan
Mas side this morning but counsel be
ing unable to decide on u harmonious
eoursi of procedure, the court post
poned thcxave until tomorow. When
the lewyers retired tonight It was by
no mums certain that u further post
ponement woultl not be required to
morrow. Hinges On IHi'Nion.
The whole problem hinges on the
decisicn of Judge Hook yesterday In
the it se of the Missouri, Oklahoma &
Gulf railroad which is In the hands of
a rccOver. Frank Hagerman, re-,
tallied as special counsel to represent
the government In tho Adutnson law
litigation, working in harmony with
the receivers, represented In this In
stance-by Judge Hook, obtained a fi
nal decree Holding that the law was
invalid and consigning It bn its merits
to the supreme court of the I'nited
States.
This case. Mr. Hagerman explained,
was In the gnvernmiit lew ample as
a lest of the constitutionality of the
wide law.
Huilroails Take Issue.
With this view attorneys for the
railroads took Isue. They maintained
that an adequate case could be pre
sented to the highest court in the land
only by Including in an appeal the Is
sues involved by participation in litiga
tion of such great systems as tno
Santa Fe or the Pennsylvania, prefer-
ubly the former.
As darkness fell neither side hud
given In. In the conferences Frank
llagcrmnn, widely known for his
eminent participation in the Missouri
2-cent fare law, headed tho govern
ment forces us special counsel for all
Adamsou litigation. Supporting him
were Carroll Todd, In charge of anti

Gregory, und K. Marvin I'nderwood,

PRICE OF BUTTER IS -RAISED
TO 50 CENTS
Increase of n Nickel a Pound for
Commodity Announced by
Grocers Here.
It costs Just one nickel more to lay
a pound of butter on Tulsa's pantry
shelf than it did two days ago.
Tho best grade has increased In
price from 45c to 50c In the Inst
couple of days and all dealers In the
city huve adopted the new figures.
The demand rising while the sup
ply Is lulling is given by the local
grocers as the reason for the boost.
The butter used in Tulsa comes from
parts of Oklahoma and Missouri and
Kansas and the increase uffects till
parts of the territory.
Tho Jump In butter cost comes close
on tho heeis of an exactly similar rise
In the price of eggs. Theso rose from
45c to 50c about a week and a half
ago and housewives have hardly got
used to the bigger figures on the
grocery bills.
