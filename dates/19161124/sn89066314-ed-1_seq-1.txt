NO RELIEF IN SIGHT
FOR COALSCARCITY
Necessary to Turn Off Heat
Again in M. U. Buildings
Early This Morning.
ARE TRACING CARS
Local Dealers Unable To
Supply Demands of the
School and City.
After heating the University build
ings temporarily for a few hours this
morning, the University found It nec
essary to cut off the heat at 10 o'clock
flue to the coal famine. There will
be no heat tomorrow and probably
- none Sunday or Monday unless a sup
ply of coal is received.
Edward E. Brown, business man
ager for the University said this morn
ing. "We arc tracing the cars, but
have been unable to locate any be
tween Columbia and St. howls. We
expect to receive a shipment of coal
between now and Sunday. Our pres
ent supply is exhausted and we have
been buying coal from local dealers,
but they "are unable to furnish us
with what we need to keep the Uni
versity heated. ,
'"Many of the classes were dismissed
this morning and probably more will
be this afternoon, for nearly all of
our coal was used this morning, and
the steam is cut off at present, with
the exception of the hospital. I do
not see how the University can con
tinue to hold classes unless we find
some means of meeting the coal fam
ine." t
The local dealers see no immediate
relief, and unless a flood of cars are
turned loose immediately there is like
ly to be much suffering for the de
mand cannot be met. Whittle &
Hockaday arc receiving from one to
two cars a day, but this In no way
&U.thelemanda-of the. people.- II. R.
Jackson, also a local dealer, says that
the situation can be handled fairly
well as long as the weather Is mod
crate, but extreme cold will cause
much suffering. He Is receiving very
little coal, and believes that the situ
ation will become worse If the thou
sands of empty coal cars in St. Louis
are not rushed to the mines.
Mr. Dalton of the Dalton Coal Com
pany received one car this morning,
and expects two tomorrow, but sees
no permanent relief from the threat
ening famine. Davis and Watson are
receiving on an average one car a day.
That firm furnished coal to the Uni
versity yesterday, but expect no perma
nent relief during the winter. The
Columbia Coal Company is turning
out about twenty-five ton a day.

The Student Senate last night de
cided to take final action on the fresh

IX THE FIELD OF TEACHING
Dean Charters Tells of the Advantages
of the Profession.
"The average teacher who is a Uni
versity graduate makes as much
money as the average lawyer or doc
tor, notwithstanding the general
opinion that a teacher is poorly paid,'
according to Dr. W. W. Charters, who
delivered the third lecture In the fac
ulty series last night, on the subject
of "The College Graduate as a Teach
er." To support this assertion he told
of the progress that members of the
class of 190S, in the School of Educa
tion, have made since graduation.
Out of the twenty-six men in the
class, one 'Is president of-" Stephens
College, one Is president and part
owner of Kemper, one Is director of
extension work, three are University
professors, six are normal school pro
fessors, three are superintendents of
schools, two are principals in St.
Louis schools, two are in religious
educational work and one Is a high
school professor. They have been out
of school only a shorts time yet they
are making on the average of $2,50P
or $3,000.
"Although the remuneration may be
a little low, the teaching profession
has many desirable advantages. There
is a permanence In the position and
one does not have the worries of busi
ness life. Pensions are being provid
ed for old teachers, so the worry for
the future is cast aside. Then, too,
the teacher has more leisure than
other professions leisure In the sense
that after he is through with class
work he can do what he likes with
the remaining time. The teacher has
a pleasant social environment For
the man who thirsts for knowledge,
the teaching, profession gives plenty of
time for investigation."
."There are four necessary charac
teristics for the teacher; first, a me
dium ability In the line in which he is
interested; second, a fondness for
study; third, he must be a hard work
u
er; and fourth, .he must be fond of
people." " ""

, .
Members'Favor a Permanent
Maintenance Fund for
the University.
That the University has made a phe
nomenal growth within the' last
twenty years with the appropriations
which have been granted is the' opin
ion of the board of visitors appointed
by the governor, expressed today by
A. E. Douglass, of Kansas City, a

member of the board. Three members .
of the board, Mr. Douglass, R. L. Al
ford of Vandalia and Frank H. Crow
ell of Butler, came last night for the
biennial inspection of the University.
They will leave Columbia tonight
The board of five members is ap
pointed to visit the University once
every two years to investigate its
needs and is required to report to the
governor before the meeting of the
General Assembly. The chairman of
the committee is Jay L. Torrey of

This Trip Merely for Inspection.
"Our trip to Columbia today is
merely one of inspection," Mr. Doug
lass said. "We will tabulate the
needs of the institution and formulate
our report at a meeting of the com;
mlttee which will be held before the
convening of the General Assembly.
"We feel that the state should stand
behind its University to the largest
possible extent What we are endeav
oring to incorporate in our recommen
dations is a plan for a permanent
maintenance fund which will place; the
University of Missouri in a position
to cope with the best state institu
tions of the United States. Missouri- is
one of the rictTst states in the Union,
and there is no reason why such a
thing is not possible. I
"The growth of the University wljh
the small appropriations which it re
ceives and the place among the edu
cational institutions of the United
States which it has taken, are Re
markable and almost unprecedented.
Committee Realizes Need of Fundi.
"The committee is pleased with the
spirit of co-operation In the institu
tion between the students and the fac
ulty. We realize that with the in
creased proportions of the student
body that ample funds must be pro
vided to maintain the University as
it should be maintained.
"We feel that a strong ajpeshoulff
be made throughout the state for a
united support of its chief educational
institution. There is no one thing
which speaks more for the progre -slveness
of a state than the hitl
standing of its state university, aid
this Is true of Missouri,
The University is also of great ai
sistance to Columbia. Jin Douglai
said, and the people of the tovii
should not fall to appreciate Just whi
the state institution is doing.

Unheralded, Robert I. Simpson
Missouri's greatest athlete, the same
unassuming Bob that left for Europe
some two months ago-arrived in Co
lumbia at 5 o'clock this morning. En
riched only by the wonderful exper
ience of the trip, some fifteen gold and
silver sups of various sizes, a few
medals, a world's record or two and
several pounds of flesh, the great ath
lete slipped quietly Into town, ready
to resume his University studies.
The American athletes. Ward, Mur
ray, Meredith, Loomis and Simpson,
who were in Sweden, Norway and
Denmark for four weeks arrived in
New York Wednesday morning, and
Simpson was not slow in making his
way back to Missouri. The party was
held up at Kirkwall, England, for

no delays.
From the time the athletes landed In
Christiania, October 11, until they Ief;
Copenhagen, November 8, there was
never an idle moment, according to
Simpson. Banquets, rides and various
other forms of amusement filled In the
time between the four track meets in
which the Americans participated. Bob

time to themselves in which to write
letters or to order a meal as they

Another record Simpson made was

guished himself, winning more points
than any other man and proving his
"all-around ability by participating in
the dashes, high jump and relay, as
well as his specialty, the hurdles.
"The cold, damp weather .was the)
only disagreeable feature of the trip,'
said Bob this morning. "We could n.ot
have asked for a better time anywhore
and the Swedes and Norwegians sire

but the lateness of the season In these I

the freezing weather and the conse

use water for is to wash with.
"Stockholm is the cleanest city I
have ever seen. All the pavement is
of cobblestones, and the houses are
built for permanence. The stores
know how to dress their windows. We
used to walk down the street just to
see the attractive window displays
so different from those in American
stores. The trains, hotels and res
taurants are all crowded, and reflect
the clean prosperity of the people.
They Didn't Get Seasick.
"We didn't get a bit seasick that's
all a matter of the mind," Bob replied
to an inquiry. Later he was asked
about the Swedish girls. "There are
certainly, lots of them, in Stockholm,,
and pretty, too," said Bob S'millng.
"It was impossible to Hnd out a
thing about what was happening in
the states," Bob wen; on. "The En
