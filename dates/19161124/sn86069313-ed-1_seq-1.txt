Washington. Nov. 21. Tlio pros
f Ductlvo European commercial war
rur tho war, viewed with Increas
ing seriousness here. Is being watch
, d carefully by American consular
ollicers ubroad and reports nre being
received regulurly at tho department
. rom many different sources. It bc-
mo known to-day that all available
able facts nro being sent on to Wash
ington, both ns to tho progress al
ready made In planning this econom
ic struggle and ns to expected future
developments.
Officials here think tho American
people do not fully realize the possi
blo effects of such post-bellum strlfo
on their hugu foreign trade, which
has passed the $8,000,000,000 mark
annually. Uncertuln ns the futuro
Is and varying as aro nil tho reports,
no doubt Is felt here that tho coun
try faces n grnvo economic danger
unless it does all possible, first to
forestall such a struggle, nnd second
to prepare against it In case present
indications aro borne out.
To Seek U-Klslntloii.
Legislation along this lino will bo
nought in Congress. Tlio Webb bill,
nllowlng American firms lo unite for
fonlgn trade without iolatlon of the
antitrust laws, is to bo urged again
in the President's next address. Tlio
Shipping Hoard, provided at iho last
Congress, Is expected to bo named
shortly und to' submit a programme
designated to freo America's sea
borne trade from dependence on for
Ign bottoms, A maximum and mlnt
inutu tariff to automatically favor
friends and punish thoso discriminat
ing against American goods Is anoth
er proposed means of defense which
will bo submitted for' consideration
by tho new tariff commissions.
Tho Stnte Department is deeply
Interested In tho threatened trade
complexities and It Is largely for
this reason that as ninny consular of-
tlcers as happen to bo in this country
f:U tho time will be sent to tho fourth
