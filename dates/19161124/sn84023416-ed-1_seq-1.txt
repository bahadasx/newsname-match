at the time, complaint was made to
Grand Juror, T. F. Butler, who im
mediately caused the arrest of re
spondent. The family came here about two
months ago from Charleston, where
the house in which they lived was
burned. Since coming here Amsden
has worked out by day's work, fol
lowing no one occupation.

Judge Lund Holds Court Ad
journed Cases Taken Up and
Hearing on Case of Charles
Shamon Set lor Tuesday, Nov.
28.
Judge Lund of Canaan held a ses
sion of municipal court at the office
of State's Attorney Powell Tuesday.
Several adjourned cases were taken
up and hearing on the case of Charles
Shamon set for next Tuesday. This
case was put over so that respondent
could secure counsel.
Late Saturday night Shamon was
arrested by Sheriff Beattie on the
charge of shooting Archie Riggie.
State's Attorney Powell and Attor
ney General Barber have been per
sistently working on this case which
has been baffling them for some
time. They have succeeded in se
curing evidence and .are holding
Shamon for the hearing next Tues
day. James R. Wood of the Wood
detective agency was given the case
and is reported to have secured a
confession from Shamon to the ef
fect that he accidentally shot Archie.
Immediately after the detective
came Shamon was arrested.
Shamon is 27 years old, a resident
of Portland, Me, He married Archie
Riggie's sister and they have been
in town abioit four weeks. Mrs.
Shamon stoutly defends her husband
and proclaims his innocence. Sha
mon is an Armenian, and is a chef,
having been employed at that work
until coming here about four weeks
ago.
Happenings that took place at the
time of the shooting of young Archie
Riggie are being brought to light.
Ovil Riggie, who is a man of small
build, was being set upon by a gang
at his home, who were bent upon
giving him a beating, and the
brother-in-law, Shamon, went to
his aid. In the melee Shamon was
getting a severe beating when Mrs.
Shamon came to his rescue. Some
time during the fight Shamon fired
his revolver and young, Archie, who
was going to his brother's aid, was
hit twice, the shot in the neck sever
ing an artery, and before medical
aid arrived was past help and soon
died from hemorrhage. Shamon
says he shot the lad but it was ac
cidental and done while defending
himself from the gang, who were
beating him up.
Sheriff Beattie, who has been per
sistently at work on the case for the
past ten days left Wednesday morn
ing for his home in Maidstone.
MUSICAL ART QUARTET
This is the Next Numher of the
Lecture Course Nov. 27 A
Male Quartet.
The Musical Art Quratetis another
star number of the Lecture course
and will be enjoyed by all lovers of
good music. This is a male quartet
that presents a program that spar
kles with life and color and will
please all who desire variety.
In talent and training, they are
splendidly equipped to deliver what
they offer. The exquisite blending
of the voices is a marked feature of
this superior entertainment. Male
quartet programs as usually given
in the lyceum, have not been on a
par with other progaams presented
by musicians of no greater ability
why? There is no reason why a male
quartet of . sincere artists should
not attain at least the same measure
of success as a mixed quartet of
acceptable artists and we present
The, Musical Art Quartet as pleas
ing proof of this position. Person
nel: Hugh Aspinwall, first tehor;
W. P Lovelass.second tenor;Fred K
Bollman, baritone; Gustave Spaethe,
bass.
