NEW SEARCHLIGHT INVENTED

Vt Ing Object Only.
Rome. Slgnor Olullo Ullvl, the In
ventor of F-raya, was badly Injured In
a laboratory experiment some time
ago, and only recovered after many
months spent In a military hospital at
Milan. Eignor Ullvl announces now
that he has succeeded In applying the
Invisible Infra red waves beyond the
red band of the spectrum to detect
objects In darkness by determining
their length.
, The new invention is known as "Sco
toscopla," meaning vision lu darkness,
and consists of a searchlight emitting
Invisible rays which Illuminate distant
objects and render them visible only to
the obserVcr. Thus by means of Sco
toscoplc searchlights warships are en
abled to see without being seen.
Photographs or rather Bcotogrnphs
of objects in durkness can be taken
and enlarged so that enemy coasts can
be mapped. The Invention can be
used on land and sea as well as In the
air, so that It will be found most use
ful in waging war against submarines
and In the defence against aerial raids.
Signals can be exchanged invisibly be
tween ships equipped with Scotoscop
tic apparatuses and other practical ap
plications of this wonderful invention
can be easily obtained.

Under Federal Guidance Crows

WosV Too Has Raised the Price of ths
Grazing Lands Upon the Reserve.
, tione Take Good Cars of
Cattle.
Washington.--The Crow Indians of
Montana went Into the cattle-raising
business two jerrs ago, under the su
pervision and e' liert guidance of tho
department of the Interior. The oth -
er day, Cato Sells, commissioner of
Indian affulrs of the department, an
nounced that the Indians' little flier
In cattle had netted them no less than
1350,00a
In announcing the climax of this
bit of business Mr. Sells told how he
hud personally aided lu the recent sale
of 34 carloads of Crow cattle at the
Chicago stocltyanls. The day before
the Chicago sulo IT other carloads of
cattle had been sold at Omaha.
It was in June, 1014, tluit the Indian
commissioner persuaded the Indians
to ninke their cattle Investment The
funds tor the accumulation of a herd
were obtained by the sale of Crow
lands, and for the Indiana the govern
ment agents bought 7,000 young heif
ers, 2,000 yearling steers and 8S0 bulls.
The care of Jhe herd wae personally
supervised by government agents In
Montana.
Took Great Care of Cattle.
The year the herd was purchased
the Indians took extraordinary pre
cautions to protect their bovine,
charges from the rigors of a Montana
winter. The summer before they cut
and stacked no Joes than 7,000. tons of
hay, and while starvation and cold
were cutting Into the profits of white
stock raisers at an alurmlng rate, the
Indiana had the satisfaction of seeing
only 2 per cent of their herds succumb
ing to the ravages of cold.
"Heretofore," said Commissioner
Sells, In speaking of the venture of the
Indians, "our conduct of the stock
business among Indians of the various
tribes has consisted largely of the up
breeding and development of herds.
Everywhere, the Indiana have taken
tremendous interest In their stock,
both as to tribal herds and those in
dividually owned, and the Increase in
number and value has been such as
to Insure a business man's profit"
In the good eld days It was the pol- i
icy of the Indian tribes on reservations ,
to lease tbelr grazing lands to white '
cattle owners at some ridiculously low
figure with the usual result that the
white man made most of. the mpuey.
Within the past three years, however, .
the Indian ofllce has been encouraging ,
Indian stock breeding, and the flnan-1
rial results after two years of stock
raising by the Crow Indians seem to
justify the value of this policy. ' ,
Three years ago, for example, one
Indian reservation In the northwest ,
had 2,800 acres under cultivation. As j
a result of the Interior department's
policy In urging the Indians to do
tliAtp nwn fnttnlnir anrl atripfe ralfllnff. 1
this same reservation had 10,000 acres
under cultivation last year. ,
Now Prosperous Farmers.'.
Back of the idea of encouraging
farming and stock raislngJiowever, Is
the basic lika "of the department of
the interior to change the western In
dian from a plainsman into an In
tensive farmer. This change, of
course, cannot be made In a genera
tion and no such rapid transforma
tion Is expected, but the Indians have
met the Intentions of the government
' more than half way, It Is declared.
' Many Indians on reservations are now
the most wealthy and prosperous
farmers In their section, while as
stockmen they are even mors success
ful. ;
The Indisn of the plains, the Indian
office 'declares, Is a natural herds
man. He Is a lover of horses, and
readily adapts himself to the raising
of cattle and sheep. During the last
three years the Indisn office has pur
chased with funds .gathered by the
Indians, more than 12,000,000 worth of
cattle, horses and sheep, both for
tribal and Individual herds. -In
cases, however, Where ths de
partment agents have been unable to 1
persuade individual Indian land own- j
ers to go into the business of cattle i
raising, they have In many cases en
abled the Indians to get higher prices '
for the leasing of grazing privileges.
For Instnnce, on the San Carlos reser
vation In Arizona, the Indians are
now receiving about 125.000 more a .
year for this privilege than they re
cslved a fi yenr ojo. . -.
,If the plan of ComtcbWloner Sells
slid Ms nft.otftt.nnta can be carried out
to Uiolr fullest extent, officials believe '
J the American Indian may some wgr
' become the cattle king of America, a
f vital factor In the wool market and a
formidable contender for horsi-breed-
lng honors. "
