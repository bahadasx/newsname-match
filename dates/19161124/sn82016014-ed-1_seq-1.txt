MYSTERY IN AUTO THEFT
George Cole and Harold Wright

Youths Stayed With Girl and

Father and sweetheart waged a bat

George Cole, charged jointly
with Harold Wright with stealing th'.'
Buick roadster of Charles D. Cuth
bert. George Cole, father, an Kast side
groceryman. spent a long time with
the boy. He tried to get him to tell
the officers all about the matter. He
tried to get him to agree to give up
the girl. Marie Koaney. He tried to
persuade him to go back home and
begin over again as he was before he
became acquainted with the girl.
When he and his father came out
of the county attorney's private o"1

"Come on," said Kiene.
The bov and his sweetheart staged
a motion picture kiss and he followed
the sheriff out.
"Murie. said Robert Garver, assist
ant county attorney, "you might Just
as well figure on letting that boy go.
You've put him in bad and he's a
goner."
The girl went out of the office cry
ing and went "tumbling down me
stain. Apparently she had won as
against the father, but in winning she
lost, for apparently it is because of
her that young Cole is standing pat
and refusing to take advantage of any
of the things that might lead to a
parole.
Harold Wright. Cole's companion on
the drive to Lawrence, was in another
private room and officers were trying
to get information from him without
success. The officers believe there
was a third parly to tne tneit 01 trie
automobile: that someone besides the
boys engineered it and told them
where to take it and how to dispose
of it.
"They refuse to admit anything of
that kind." said W. K. Atchison, coun
ty attorney. 'I never saw two young
boys who were more headstrong. They
ore stubborn and I believe the best
thing that can happen to them is to
spend a term in the reformatory. I
hate to send them over the road, too.
They are young and this is the first
trouble they have had."
Girl Is Blamed.
Marie Roaney is blamed by the of
ficers for the trouble the boys are in.
They do not charge her with having
aided in the theft of the automobile
but they hold that if the boys had not
been associating with her there would
have been no theft.
She has a house at 1818 East Tenth
avenue and both boys have been stay
ing there. Before she moved there
she was on West First street and four
or five arrests were made of men who
were hanging around that place. She
Is only 18 years of age and an excep
tionally good looking girl.
Cole told the officers today that
Marie Koaney tried to make the boys
take the car back after they had driv
en it out to her house.
"Cole told me." said Mr. Atchison,
'that she begged them to take it back
where they got it; that she knew it did
not belong to them and that she knew
It would get them into trouble. Sh
even kept Cole's clothes so he couldn'
get away with the car but he got hold
of his overcoat and drove away in the
clothes he had on."
Cole is apparently infatuated with
the Koaney girl. Apparently she is
infatuated with him also but county
officers doubt it. Cole is merely a boy
while she is a woman, so far as ex
perience is concerned. Heretofore she
has been associating with grown men.
When Cole was first brought back
to the county jail the Roaney girl was
at the jail ready to go out and raise
a oond tor him. But his father was
there abo and he objected to having
his son released upon any bond fur
nished by the girl. He stated that he
would prefer keeping him in iail to
having him associate with her." The
officers refused to release Cole upon
any bond furnished by the girl and un
less somor.e relents he will say in
jail alon;; with Wright until his case
comes up for trial.
Take a Gun and Got Money.
Young Wright is related to Mr. and
Mrs. H. E. Pendry. They were at the
court house today to talk with him
and

Wright refused to talk to any

"1 don't know anything about such '
matters, he said. "I was never in a I
court room in my life. I don't know
where the Judge sits nor where the

like I was going to find out all right"
Cole told the officers that Wright

Wright denied this. Then Marie

Trepoff Gets Highest Folitical
Position in Empire.
Premier Sturmer Removed to
Stem Crisis, Is Belief.
GREATEST VICTORY IN HISTORY
First Time People Succeeded in
Moulding Government.
Trepoff Won Distinction by In
vestigation of Noble Class.
Petrograd. Nov. 24, via London.
The appointment of M. Trepoff as pre
mier is announced in the newspapers.
The council of the empire has been
adjourned by imperial ukase until
December 2.
The retirement of Premier Sturmer
and the appointment of M. Trepoff as
his successor probably are outgrowths
of what has been referred to in a few
carefully censored Petrograd dis
patches recently as a serious political
crisis. The change apparently implies
a victory for the liberal elements of
Russia over the bureaucratic regime,
for M. Sturmer always has been prom
inent in the affairs of the Russian
bureaucracy, while M. Trepoff, in the
past, has engaged in a variety of re
form work.
Altho Russia has been a constitu
tional monarchy since 1905 when the
first step toward a representative gov
ernment was made, the legislative.
executive and judicial powers have
continued to be united to a great ex
tent in the emperor, who still bears
the title of autocrat. There is a dis
tinct cleavage, moreover, between the
duma and the government whose
members are appointed by the em
peror and are not responsible to the
duma. It was this condition that was
largely responsible for the serious
political crisis that came to a head
with the recent assembling of the
duma. At that time the government
was made the object of a bitter attack
by various influential parties, repre
senting the voice of public opinion
which could not be ienored. ami th
displacement of M. Sturmer probably
means that for the first time in Rus
sian history the representatives of the
people have succeeded in moulding
the government in accordance with
their wishes.. ...- . -

Diplomats Believe Peace May
Be Jfearer Than Supposed.
Washington. Nov. 24. Official and
diplomatic Washington was taken
agreeably by surprise today by the
peace dictum of the Earl of Derby,
British under secretary of war. His
declaration "that any peace proposals
from Germany will receive the con
sideration they deserve," was said to
be the first utterance of the kind,
holding out any promise of possible
peace, emanating from a responsible
member of the British government.
Diplomatists especially viewed the
declaration as a hint from Britain that
reason and discussion may prevail
where force has failed. The earl's as
sertion that "the allies can not enter
tain an idea of peace which does not
give them what they are fighting for,"
was interpreted by diplomats to mean
that there is no clearly defined pur
pose on the part of any of the belliger
ents at the present moment to over
come the enemy, which to date has
been proved impossible of accomplish
ment. What Do They Fight For?
A discussion of peace terms among
the belligerents, it was said, alone
could discover the objects of the war
so that the belligerents themselves
might understand them. All are now
fighting blindly; the objects of the
war hb stated at the commencement
are ignored. A diplomat of the high-
esi sianuing saia today:
the allies can not say they are
fighting to give Constantinople to
Russia and to restore Poland to Rus
sia, uermany Is known to be readv
to restore Belgium and to return to
France her occupied territory. Austria-Hungary
is willing to cede a por
tion of Galicla to Russia and probably
the rest to new Poland; she is also
willing to cede to Italy a portion of
tne territory in possession of Italian
troops.
Can't Crush Germany.
"Questions of compensation, of eco
nomic arrangements . and collateral
problems can only be settled by the
peace. What else remains? If the
allies should insist Germany be
crushed, they know that they will
have to face many years of terrific
fighting with expenditures of men and
treasure that will not pay them for
any advantage they might gain and
the world would then know that the
allies were fighting really for con
quest. Lord Derby has indicated that
there must be discussion to end the
war and that only discussion can end
it."
This authority, who is in a position
to know the official attitude of the
British government as well as that of
Germany, the two predominant bel
ligerents, toward peace, continued:
Peace May Be Near.
"Peace may be nearer at hand than
is commonly supposed. It appears to
be beyond doubt however, that neither
I England nor Germany will make the
iiiumi move, ana mat the discussion
must be opened by some neutral
friendly to both governments. All the
neutral world is of the opinion that
only one power is in a position to
f!aK Wi',th SUC.h convincing force that
the belligerents would hesitate long
unore turning a aear car to it
power is the United States.

As a diplomatist, I think President
Wilson has it within his power to
bring the' war to a close. I don't be
lieve he would suggest an armistict
or truce, but would mako a blunt
statement to the warring nations,
rather than an appeal even.
"The president's most effective plan
would be. I believe, to prepare an

Washington, Nov. 24. President
Wilson will be given a free rein by
the railroads of the country in work
ing out legislative remedies for In
dustrial disputes. It was learned to
day that assurances to this effect hav
come from railroad officials.
The reasons are two-fold. First. It
has become known the roads, devoting
their entire time in combating the
'constitutionality of the Adamson eight-
hour law, have not considered formu
lation of a plan which would meet the
approval of the brotherhoods.
Second, the road executives believe
the president can be depended on by
themselves, brotherhoods and the pub
lic to put forth a feasible plan that
will eliminate the strikes to which
transportation systems now are sub
jected and would be supported by all
parties concerned.
Put Wh' - Thine Vp to Wilson.
It was admitted today after frequent
conferences of the railroad executives
to formulate some definite plan of eli
minating strikes and lockouts, it wa
decided to "put the whole thing up to
Wilson." In this connection, it was
explained that the executives have
reached the conclusion that anv such
plan submitted by them could not be
regarded "the best and most iAtisrsL--
tory" since it might be looked upon as
a measure constructed "in submission
to the acknowledged power of labor
and tempered with threats of strike
by tho workers."

Baltimore, Md., Nov. 24. Tho
Adamson law was expected to be a

Federation of Labor convention today.
With the general subject of the shorter

members of the federation were ready
to press home the advantage given
them In their long fight with the fed
eration administration over the ques
tion of obtaining shorter hours by leg
islation rather than by sticking strictly
to labor organization means.
1!n" reD,y of tne administration is
that the Adamson act was thrust upon
organized labor, without having been
asked for. Speeches of the brother
