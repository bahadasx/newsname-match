THE INCONVENIENT BRIDE.
THE melancholy fate of Ellen Scan.
lan has been the theme of many
heartrending ballads and tragic tales,
and although it is nearly a century
since she died, her story still is told in
Irish homes. She was a beautiful girl
--so beautiful as to attract much at
tention in a city noted for lovely wom
en. She was also clever and witty, and
had many admirers. She lived with
I her uncle, a prosperous Dublin rope
maker, named Conery, and when John
Scanlan appeared upon the scene she
hadn't a care in the world.
Scanlan was a native of County Lim
erick and was closely related to po
pie of wealth a'nd distinction. lie was
on his way home from the wars, with
his servant. Stephen Sullivan. Travel
Ing in those days was an onerous busi
mess, so the young officer was glad to
take a lay off at Dublin. While loung
ing about the town, to see what he
might see, he met Ellen and fell in love
with her on the spot. He was an ag
gressive wooer, and, being handsome
and eloquent, and of a higher station
than the girl, It didn't take him long
to win her consent to marry him. While
Ellen was making her few brief prep
arations for the ceremonx, Scanlan
went away to charter a clergyman, and
that his heart was evil is shown by the
fact that he engaged an unfrocked
priest, believing that a marriage cere
mony performed by such a man would
not be valid.
The two were married, and at once
repaired to the little village of Glin,
on the banks of the River Shannon,
where they gave a demonstrat3n of
love in a cottage, the faithful Sullivan
being in attendance. For a little while
the girl was entirely happy, and her
husband professed to be, but only for
a little while. One day Scanlan re
ceived a letter from his sister, who was
He Stood Up With the Club Upraised.
the wife of a nobleman, in which she
notiti.d him that she had engineered
a great match for him. There was an
heiress in the nobleman's neighborhood
Swho was prepared to surrender as soon
I as Scanlan laid siege to her. There
fore, his sister reasoned. It was his
duty and privilege to get busy at once.
None of the young man's relatives
;knew anything of his marriage. That
Shad been made a profound secret.
lie must have been a peculiarly cold
blooded individual. If he had a heart
at all it was made of galvanized iron.
SEven while his beautiful girl-wife lav
Ished her caresses upon him he plotted
her destruction. One day when she
was in the garden gatlhering roses
Scanlan called Sullivan into the house
and told him. In so many words, that
the woman would have to be put out of
the way. It is creditable to Sullivan
that he made a protest, and was I
shocked. But Scanlan was his heredi
tary lord, so to speak, and obedience'
to his master was the first principle
of his life. He soon yielded to his
master's persuasion, and the inhuman
butchers sat planning the crime, while I
the victim, smiling and singing, was
ransacking the garden under their eyes.
Scanlan had a pleasure boat on the
river, and riding in it was one of hist
wife's chief pleasures. They took an
excursion every evening. On a July
evening in 1819 Scanlan explained that
he had been called away on business, I
but Sullivan would take her for the i
customary boat ride. She took her t
seat in the boat, and Sullivan took the a
oars, and presently she noticed a heavy
I club in the bottom of the boat. She (
Sasked what that was for, and Sullivan (
was greatly confused. He didn't know
what it was doing there, he said.. Then
she saw a large rock with a rope at.
tached to it, and she wanted that exa
plained. Sullivan was more e
rassed than ever. He didn't like* .
explain that it was meant to sink her
body in the water. But the girl had
no suspicion of evil She was merely
curious. After a while they reached an
Inlet cut off from human view, and Sul
livan set about his task. He stood up
with the club upraised, to dash out
her brains, and she looked at him and
smiled. She thought he was fooling.
Sullivan threw the club overboard, took
the ours, and rowed back home without
a word.
"I couldn't do it," he explained t
Scanlan, who upbraided him .bitterly
to his failure; "when that poor girl
smiled at me my muscles seemed
turned to water."
There was no pity in Scanlan's gal
vanized iron heart, however. He was
determined upon the girl's death. His
sister was becoming impatient, and the
heiress was growing restive, and a dele
gation might arrive any time, to see
what was holding him at Glln. A few
evenings later he and Sullivan and the
bride went for another boat ride, and
she was seen alive no more. Scanlan
told the neighbors that he had sent
. his wife for a sea voyage, but few peo
y ple believed his story. There was a
general impression that something was
y wrong, but nobody knew just what.
n The whole community knew, though, a
-I week later, when the body of Ellen
t- Scanlan was washed ashore. She had
I. leen so mutilated that identification
( was difficult. Most of her bones were
h broke.n. lHer skull was shattered, as
though beaten in with a club. Her
n teeth had been knocked out and her
e once beautiful face was one great
bruise.
Scanlan made an effort to escape but
was overtaken. His trial was the sen
sation of the time, and he was found
h guilty. He was ordered to immediate
execution, so that his powerful rela
tives would have no time to exercise
,their pull in his behalf. Those rela
tives used all their influence, but in
e vain. If ever capital punishment was
,justified, it was when this man ap
peared upon the scaffold.
e Sullivan escaped for the time. After
n selling the dead woman's clothes, and
some small articles of jewelry she had
owned, he fled and concealed himself,
but the law was looking for him, and
Sfound him twelve months after the
I crime. After being jailed and brought
to a realization of the fact that his
1 door of hope was everlastingly closed,
he made a full confession, and in due
j season was operated upon by the pain
less executioner.
The story entitled "The Poor Man's
Daughter," in the once famous "Tales
of Irish Life," was one of the innumer
able printed narratives founded upon
the atrocious murder of Ellen Scan
lan.
PUBLIC'S DEBT TO DRUGGIST
Many People In Community Fall to
Give Him All the Credit That.
Is Coming to Him.
From the nature of the problems
,considered by the druggists in their
national convention it is plain that
they take their business with the se
riousness that its intimate relation to
practically the entire public demands.
They seem especially interested in
combating the trend of public opinion
in favor of restricting the freedom of
the druggist to handle his commodities
about as he pleases. The druggist's
point of view is, of course, not that of
the public. Long association with dan
gerous drugs breeds a certain con
tempt for their dangers. Yet the drug
gist is morally-when not legally
obliged to protect the public against
its own folly and incompetence.
An unscrupulous druggist can be
the means of spreading almost as
much evil in a community as an un
scrupulous physician. And a dishon
est physician working in league with
a dishonest druggist can become a pos
itive menace to the health and morals
of any communit'. The druggist is
called upon to observe many laws.
This state of affairs has come about,
not through any public desire to sin
gle out a particular line of business
for careful regulation, but because a
certain class of druggists themselves
have In the past abused their responsi
bility. Thus the laws have been forced
upon the people by druggists, para
Sdoxical as this may seem.
The average druggist is a far more
important person in the community
than he gets credit for being. His
store is a kind of combination pharm
acy, cafe, club, cigar store, news stand,
waiting room, post office and tele
phone station. For many of his favors
to his patrons he receives no pay, and
he is not to be blamed for trying to
educate the public to its obligations to
him. In his business competition ia
strong. He works early and late, Sun
days and holidays, and still the drug.
gists who grow rich are very rare. The
difference between the reward the
Sdruggist gets and the reward the same
Sdevotion to business would earn in
other lines is his contribution to pub
lic welfare, and this the public should
not forget-Indlanapols News.
Mixture of Many Races.
Not only in their features, but in
their language, do the natives of Saw
dinla retain traces of the many races
which have occupied the island through
the centuries-Phoenicians. Carthagin
lans. Romans. Saracens, Italians and
Spaniards. Many dialects are spoken,
but Italian is now taught In the
schools and the men acquire the off
cial language during their period of
compulsory military service.-National

HERE were 900 of us from
6 Calgary," said a young man
in khaki, with the word
"Canada" in gold letters on
his shoulder, "and now there are not
200 of us left worth looking at."
"We were cut up," he said, "three
separate times. I was called out for
special duty and the man who took
my place got it right between the
eyes."
"What are you waiting here sort' I
asked him, Hope F. M. Ross writes to
the Manitoba Free Press from Lon
don.
"Well," he said, "I was just waiting
here to see if I could hear Big Ben."
"I read a story many years ago about
London bridge. In the old days there
was a fortified gate at each end and,
as a rule, there was an array of human
heads in view, placed there, as the
French sat, for the encouragement of
the others. The edifice was more like
a street than a bridge, having a row of
houses along each side.
"The old picture was a strange one,
but the people of that day would have
deemed the picture df this sunny sum
mer morning much more remarkable.
On the bridge today there were
young soldiers of South Africa, of New
Zealand, of Australia and of Canada.
There are many aFnls both mailors
and soldiers, mes it ualtms which
are not seen in Canada. All these young
men are in Britaln and Iunliform to
day in this incredible war.
I told my Canadian friend that he
might hear Big Ben-which, as every
body knows, is the huge bell in the
main tower of the house of parlia
ment-provided it was rang, but that
it would not ring again until after the
war.
We looked out from the bridge over
the city on both sides of the river and
I was reminded of these words of'
Heine, written, of course, long before
the world dreamed of the present de
velopments. "I have seen," said Heine,
"the greatest wonder that the world
can show to the astonished spirit I
have seen it and am more astonished
than ever, and still there remains in
my memory that stone forest of houses,
and amid'them the rushing stream of
faces, of living human faces, with all
their motley passions, all their ter
rible impulses of love, of hunger and
of hate."
The river itself was peaceful enough
and serene, clearer than Canadians
would expect to find it and much nar
rower. The Thames is only 900 feet
wide at this point, which lonstitutes
the reason why the first structure was
built here. Up to the latter part of
the eighteenth century everyone used
this crossing, since there was no other
medium except the boats,
The soldier by my side looked long
into the busy "pool," but I do not think
he saw anything except the bloody
struggles of the war. He did not tell
me, but I was aware that he was not
thinking of London. Perhaps he
thought of that little prairie village in
Alberta, out of which 20 young men
came with the first contingent, and to
which, if destiny so wills it, not a sin
gle one will return.
At St Margaret's Church.
We decided to make the long jour
ney down to St Margaret's church, ad
joining the abbey. The preacher of
the day was Canon Murray of St.
John's college of Winnipeg, and
among the auditors I maw one of the
wardlns of the St. John's cathedral
Sheriff Inkster.
St. Margaret's does not make the
same appeal that,the abbey and St.
Paul's do, but there is plenty in this
historic structure to satisfy the imag
Ination. As the service proceeded, this
morning it came on to rira, as they
say in Scotland, and the church -grew
dimmer, the light slowly fading. The
wonderful windows gained in beauty,
and the entire place became redolent
of the past.
After the service one roa the wardens
showed me the wlidows in detail. I
asked after the faeous east one, since
I had knows sbout it, and the warden
said that he did not know where it
was. This swindow, as I recollect, was
presented by 8pain to ing Uenry VII
and at a later tlm it was emoved
from Its place Sm the east of St. Mar
garet's in the fear that the soldiers of
Cromwell might ~stry it Now, ap
parently, it *u~ose agatn and its
place was akE plain glass, O.
the former occasion or Its diasappearý
ance it was said that it was hidden
in the tower of the church.
"I do not know where it is," said
the warden. "It was taken out in the
fear that it might be destroyed in a
Zeppelin attack. We know that the
chance was slight, but it was best to
be safe."
The warden then called my atten
tion to windows ls which people of
the United Stateb bad an interest.
Among these is the large one in the
west which bears the American flag,
a very small one, at the upper left
hand side, with the British arms in
the corresponding place on the other
side. This was placed in the church,
as is well known, wholly by people of
the United States, and beside it is an
other put in by George W. Childs of
Philadelphia.
The large church had been well
filled for the morning service of
prayer, and as the rain was falling
heavily at the close many f the wor
shipers lingered longer than usual. I
am not well up on the dlierences be
tween the high and low church, but I
am free to say that the service in St.
Margaret's seemed very natural and
sincere. The war has had its efect
on many things, and Iias given an
atmosphere of reality to the teaers
of the church which w.e not slWhis
present in the past. The words were
read In normal human tone and under
the circumstance it is no wonder.
In and Around Hyde Park.
It was the afternoon and- my friend
the captain and I were standing at the
Marble arch, Just outside the entrances
to Hyde Park. It was raining and we
were waiting the arrival of another
friend, looking eastward toward the
city.
Suddenly we heard the music of a
band coming from the west, and turn
ing in that direction I saw for the first
time the army of the working men of
London, more interesting to me than
the most brilliant and inspiring mili
tary display.
They filled the street from side to
side, marching on with a hundred im
mense banners and bands playing in
spite of the rain, falling now actually
in torrents. They are used to the
showers, these London people, and
they cheered and shouted and marched
into the park.
In the park the men gathered about
various platforms in accordance with
the usual custom, and twenty or thirty
addresses were given. The speaking
was good in quality, too, the leaders
being men of force if not of much edu
cation. "While the navy has been
blockading the Germans," said one of
the speakers, "the mercantile marine
has been blockading us."
In the evening we walked down to
Kingsway and down Kingsway to Ald
wych and the Strand. London is very
dark at night, but the inconvenience
is slight and there is less crime, as
the records show, than usual. I asked
a police officer on the Strand why it
was that under the circumstances of
fenses were less numerous than before
the war, and he replied that a lot of
young men who had formerly gone
about bashing private edtizens were
now bashing the Germaqp. There is
another reason to which the officer did
not refer, but which is worthy of con
sideration, namely, that crime has di
minished in London because poverty
has diminished. Wages are higher
both for men and women and there is
not the same reason fer certaln classes
of violations of the law.
In the evening we werq close to one
of the sites visited by devotees of
Charles Dickens, and when I made
some inquiry and received a reply not
particularly illuminative I was remind
ed of the answer made to Dickens hinl
self. Long after he had written "Lit
tle Dorrit" he made the attempt to
located the Marshalsea prison. He final
ly found a portion of it and learned
that someone was lodging in $he old
room.
"Who is living in this apartment?"
Dickens asked of a very small boy.
"Tom Pithick," was the reply. "And
who is Tom Pithickr'" pursued the
great novelist, to which he rOceived
the natural answer, "He is Joe
Plthick's uncle."
