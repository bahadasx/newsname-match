American Firm Loeeg Big Contract as
Allied Munition Industry Grows
—"War Babies" Doomed.
New York. Nov. 24.—Confirmation
of a report that the British govern
ment had obtained the relinquishment
of a $60,000,000 munitions contract
by the Mldvale Steel Aid Ordnance
company was taken In many quarters
today to. lndioate that the days of
some of Wall street's most thriving
war babies are numbered.
That the allies have worked Into a
position Where they are almost in
dustrially Independent of the United
States beoame a matter of common
knowledge three weeks ago, when H.
B. Davidson of J. P. Morgan and com
pany returned from Rurope. Mr.
Davidson brought with him the news
of waht England, France and Russia
have been accomplishing behind the
lines, and also a warning.
Unless the American manufacturers
of munitions decide to relax their
terms, he predicted, the allies would
probably withdraw a great share of
their war trade.
"Great Britain and France," said
Mr. Davidson, "have developed their
manufacturing resources in a way
that surpasses belief. Today they
find themselves well equipped and
able to provide not only for them
selves, but in a large degree to assist
their allies."

London, Nov., 24.—Alexander Tre

has been appointed premier, accord
ing to a Renter's dispatch from Petro
grad. The retiring premier, M. Stur
dier, by an Imperial ukase, has been
appointed grand chamberlain of the
imperial court, retaining his functions
as a member of the council of the
empire. Petrograd newspapers say
the appointment of M. Trepoff as
premier implies the necessity that the
government make a communication
to parliament explaining impending
problems connected with the work of
the government.
The retirement of Premier Sturmer
of Russia and the appointment of M.
Trepoff as his successor, was an

today. This probably is the outgrowth
of what has been referred to In a few
carefully censored Petrograd dis

crisis.
The change apparently impllee a

a bureaucratic regime in Russia, and
some reports Indicate, the change
may result in an agreement between

GERMANS HAMPERED IN
RUMANIAN CAMPAIGN
Failure at Predeal Pam Costly—Allies
Capture All Objectives in West,
Maurice Says.
London, Nov. 24.—"It Is for Hln
denburg to say whether the gains of
the German army in Rumania pay for
the losses sustained on the other
fronts by the withdrawal of divisions
to operate there," said Major General
F. B. Maurice, chief director of mili
tary operations of the war office, in
discussing today with an Associated
Press correspondent, the latest mili
tary developments.
"It is impossible and foolish to
prophesy the outcome of the German
campaign in Rumania," continued
General Maurice, "but I can say the
first efforts to cut through by the way
of Predeal Pass have been a failure.
Since that time the Germane have
had to go a long way around, thereby
giving the Rumanians time which
they need.
'^The Germans have a long line of
communications to defend while the
rapid approach of mid-winter oper
ates In favor of the Rumanians.
"I will not undertake to say wheth
er further successes by the Germans
in that area might compensate them
for other losses. Since their venture
began, the French at Verdun have re
gained much lost ground and captur
ed 6,000 prisoners, while we gained
a considerable victory on the Ancre
with 7,000 prisoners and the Italians
took more ground on their front as
well as 5,000 prisoners.
"I have just returned from a visit
to the scene of our late success and
can assure you we captured everything
we set out to gain, despite the official
German communiques asserting that
we had much greater objectives in
view."
