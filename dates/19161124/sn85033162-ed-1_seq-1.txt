NUMBER 40
NEWPORT
The Women's Civic Improve
ment Club Mrs. Dave Harding
president is engaged in improv- I
ing the city park. Four teams ;
under the direction of Joe Park-
hurst road supervisor are engag-
ea m scraping sand off the hill
on the west side of the park to
fill the lily pond as it used to be
called, so as to raise it up out of
the water about four feet. The
pond is now about two thirds
filled and it wont take long to
fill the remainder and the park
"with its beautiful surroundings
is the prettleBt In the county. It
, is the intention of the Club to
place a living fountain n the cen
ter lof the park and this will add '
much to its usefulness and at
traction. After the hill is grad
ed down, a pavillion will be
placed on the ground. A build
ing large enough to hold com
munity fairs and to accommo
date public assembly3 that may
meet there. Whore this bulldirg
is to be put up, gives a-splendid
view of the Pacific ocean and
surrounding country. This park
contains four acres donated by
the late Samual Case to the city.
It is now valuable and the. name
ought to be changed from the
City to Case Park to perpetuate
the memory of the donor. The
money to make this Improve
ment is raised by giving public
entertainments. Newport con
tinues her improvements right
along and still keeps from mak
ing more debt.
The Women of Woodcraft will
give a Thanksgiving turkey din
r.er at the banquet room of the
I. O. O. F. Hall Thursday 'even
ing the 23d; and a dance at night
in the Rod and Gun Club Hall.
A general Invitation is extended
to all who may wish to come and
onjoy this festival occaosion.
The supper will be unusually
fine as the Women of Wood
craft don't make any failures.
The Rod and Gun Club will al
so give a grand masquerade ball
and supper on Thanksgiving
evening at their hall Nov. 30th.
Prizes will he given to the best
sustained characters.
Tho Churches will have a Un
ion Service at the Baptist
Church Thanksgiving day at 10
o'clock A. M- A special pro
gram will be prepared and every
body is envitod.
The election being over the
people are quietly settling down
to business for another four
years. V.'hat 4he future has in
si ore Tor us no one knows. Hut
"we will patiently wait and see.
Thore Republicans who voted
for Air. Wilson because "he kept
us o.it i" war" may live to see
war wiih Mexico before the
trouble is nettled. Murder, rape
and crime still goes on In that
country unabated. The war in
Europe seems to be gathering
momentum and no one knows
where it will stop. We may have
n world war before we get peace.
The lowering sky looks dark and
portentous. It is Bald Mr.
Hughe.! w:i3 defeated because
lie did not canvass the 3tates of
California and Washington in
company with Senator Poindex
ter ami Governor Johnson. If
these gentlemen were peeved at
this and these states were lost
to the republican column fo
lark o" harmony, It may read
o.i the flenublican party at s.nr.e
future lime. As the Republicans
had a splendid candidate it
Bims !:i'i!;Hh that they did not.
Etny together and elect him. The
DeinccKits stick better than Re
publicans do ad though they
were out of power for many
yours, did not fail to keep up
their party organization and now
that they are in the saddle for
another four years, all emolu
ments and appointments will go
to deserving Democrats and the
weak kneed Republicans who
helped them In will have to whis
tle. While the Valley is having
frost, fog and cold weather, wo
are having bright sunshine.
FIECLES CREEK
Trio?
Our legal voters save one
(your humble Bervant) were
able to make use of the polling
privlledge. I "goes" wita Taft
and the G. O. P. I Bay Taft be- j
cause the judicial mind as pres
ident of these great united states
appeals to me. At this 6tage of
the game there is no room for
bombast, brass bands or flam
beau clubs. No time to squib
away the vote which is a syllog
ism. No time to place some pet
upon a pedastal and fall down
and worship him. We must
stand by our party and the plat
form using the elective merely
as a medium or meap.s to the
end. It la a beautiful thought
that women now have the oppor
tunity to help place the right
personage in power, for when I
was knee high to a grasshop
per I attended with my mother
a Women's Right Convention
(at that time some what cen
Borcd) at Portland, where Mrs.
Dunlwaj ring leader, her sister,
Mrs. C. A. Cobura, Mrs. Dr.
Thompson and my mother were '
principles assisted by spirits of
progress. One of these spirits
was Rev. Elliot, D. D. of the
Baptist Church clleganf, ello
quent of polished ebony. For
aught I could determine he was
St. Claire's valet, and his mouth
did not run on shutters.
Harking across the years it
makes me wioth that splendid
plea and peroation for the en
franchisement of women. The
attainments of that black man
born In slavery Bhame me as
does Helen Keller, Booker T.
Washington and Abe Lincoln.
Mental champions Ability to
whip natural talent Into use and
Ini'luence ior self and others.

TOLEDO 13; NEWPORT 0
The football game between
Toledo and Newport played on
the local gridiron, last Sunday,
proved a surprise to everyone,
and demonstrated that "pep"
counts for more than "beef" in
a football game. The Newport
ers outweighed the locals con
siderable, still they were out
played in all departments of the
game.
The game started off with To
ledo kiclfing to Newport, and
the flrst few downs the heavy
Newport team ploughed through
Toledo's line for big gains, and
;'t looKect line an ea3y victory tor
mircrs by the way thev tore
through the Newport line for
yardajie. Carson. McMillan. Al-
tree ana bturaevant seemed
to
never tire, and made good sub
stantial gains on almost every
down. "Cannon-Ball"' proved
that he was well named, as a real
cannon-ball could not have
wrought much more havoc.
Sturdevant and Carson pulled off
a double pass that mystified
their opponents and netted a big
gain. A foreward pass, Carson
to Ofstedahl, gained about twen
ty yards and paved the way for
the first touchdown. The locals
jgoaj Ull0 fmir t,m but tvdce lt
j wag brought back for off-side
iPlaying. nnd the Toledo goal line
never was in danger. McMillan
and Carson did the pinning for
Toledo and got their punts off in
.better shape than did Coffield
iwho did the punting for New
port. Genn for Newport tore off
a long end run that netted con
siderable yardage, and did Borne
I good work tackling. Fogarty
and Coflleld each bad their heads
ihurt, and McMillan received a
sprained ancle. Miller, and IJelt
