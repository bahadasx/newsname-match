Entertainment
Course Planned
By High School
Six Fine Attractions Booked For
v This Season Beginning On
December 5th.
The High School has taken charge of
the Lecture Course for this season and
has arranged for a series of exception
ally fine entertainments. Several of
these attractions have been booked
independently of any bureau so that a
better quality of talent has been secur
ed tnan can usually be afforded. Also
because of the better rate received,
there will be six fine attractions in
stead of the five usually booked. The
price of the course tickets however,
will remain the same.
Manager Adams of the Temple Thea
tre has booked no big attractions for
the winter and a Lecture Course is al
most a necessity to furnish high class
entertainment for the public. It is a
benefit to any community and every
one interested in a better town ought
to get behind it and boost.
On Tuesday, Dec. 5th, the Course
"will be opened by the Chicago Orches
tral Sextette, a strong company of ex
perienced musicians, giving a high
class popular concert, of great variety.
The company includes a male quartet,
soprano soloist, contralto, reader and
in the orchestral numbers uses the vio
lin, saxephones, cello, trombone and
piano. No other company can surpass
it in playing either classical or popular
music and the vocal numbers never
fail to please the most critical. This
one number is worth the one dollar
which the entire course ticket will cost.
Dr. John Merritte Driver, whose
lecture is usually secured only on pay
ment of a fee of $150 will be the at
traction on Dec. 18th. Dr. Driver is
the successor of the famous Dr. Frank
Crane of the People's Church, Chicago,
and has degrees from several large
universities in this country and abroad.
He returns to Europe on the tenth of
January for a study of the war condi
tions and we are fortunate to get him
for this number.
On January 9th we have a return
engagement with Byron V. King, the
veteran lecturer who made such a hit
on the course last season and who is
better known than any man on the
lecture platform today. He can enter
tain with humorous as well as serious
thoughts and is famous as a reader of
humorous verse. He never fails to
leave an impression of being a master
in his art and a keen and witty philoso
pher of life. Many East Jordan people
would pay a dollar just to hear King
again.
'The attraction on Jan.- 18 will be the
Kuehn Concert Company, a party of
four artists giving a program of instru
mental and vocal. Mr. Kuehn, leader
of the company, was for many years
the first violinist for the Thomas
Orchestra of Chicago. He is a native
of Germany and was for some years
the concertmaster or the Hamburg
Philharmonic Orchestra. The cellist
with the company is Mr. Nicolai Zedeler
who will be remembered here as hav
ing appeared with the Schumann Quin
tet two years ago. He has been solo
cellist with the Mertropolitan Opera
Company of New York. The vocalist
of the party was characterized by Opie
Read, the author, in these words There
is no sweeter voice on the American
platform, which means the platform of
the world.
On February 2Gth we will have the
Operatic Quintette, representing a
program of celections from standard
operas and operettas. The five people
making up this company .are sent out
by the Ithica Conservatory of Music
and have pleased large audiences all
over the country. It is of the same
high class as the other concert numbers.
The course will be cjosed on March
14th with a lecture by. Frank Dixon,
one of the Redpath Bureau's most able
and most popular men, a man of long
platform experience. Mr. Dixon has
a itfecial message along the line of civic
pride which should be heard by every
citizen. He is a brother of Thomas
Dixon, author of the Birth of a Nation
and other great plays and novels. Mr.
Dixon has as great a reputatidn as a
lecturer as his brother has as an author
and we are fortunate to secure him for
te number.
. The price for season tickets for the
entire six numbers is only $1.00 for
adults and 75c for pupils of the schools.
This is the biggest bargain that lecture
course patrons were ever offered and
the attendance should be larger than
ever. Don't fail to buy when called
upon by the students of the high school.
Carnegie Library
Is Assured
East Jordan
After Years of Debating, East
Jordan is to Finally Have
a Public Library
The mills of the gods grind slowly,
but East Jordan has been slower yet in
reaching a decision on the public
library proposition. Without question
a majority of our citizen tax payers
were in favor of a library but for years
we had a small percentage who were
opposed to the proposition and it has
taken years to have these people see
things in their proper light. For the
past six or eight years VV. P. Porter of
the East Jordan Lumber Co., has gener
ously offered to donate a fine building
lot on the corner of Main and Williams
street as a site for a library building.
In addition to this. A. H. Frost of the
East Jordan Lumber Co., has recently
come forward with an offer to donate
Five Hundred Dollars per year for a
period of five years for the maintenace
of such an institution.
The Carnegie Corporation make us a
liberal proposition and easy to meet.
They will furnish the City of East Jor
dan $12,000 to erect a free public library
providing the city will pledge ten per
cent of this amount per year for main
tenance. With a building donated, a
site donated, and $500 per year for five
years donated for maintenance, East
Jordan could not afford to pass the
opportunity by. A petition to our City
Commission asking them to accept the
offer, was presented that body, signed
by practically all of our tax-payers. As
will be seen in the proceedings of the
Commission published elsewhere in
this issue, the matter was taken up and
passed. East Jordan will undoubtedly
have its long-needed public library
within a year.
LEWIS-PORTER NUPTIALS
The home of Mr. and Mrs. W. P.
Porter was the scene of wedding festivi
ties Wednesday evening when their
daughter, Flora M., became the bride of

shower bouquet of lilies of the valley.
Following the ceremony the young
couple left on a wedding trip and after
this will be "At Home" at Beloit, Wis.,
where the groom has a fine position as
head of one of the departments of a
large manufacturing concern.

wedding were Bert Lewis of Atlantic
City, N. J., Miss Eva Lewis of Bad Axe,
Miss Pearl Lewis of Grand Rapids, and
Miss Esther Porter who is attending
Oberlin College.

IT
East Jordan Responds
THE "GO-TO-CHURCH" CAMPAIGN FRAUGHT
WITH GRATIFYING RESULTS.
Contributed
We believe the full value of churches to any community
receives its share of recognition by the people of East Jordan.
During the "Go-to-Church" campaign which was ushered in by a
Proclamation from Mayor Cross, pleasing results are reported by
our local churches and we are sure that if everybody reasoned
this matter of church-going to its logical conclusion there would
not be many vacant pews anywhere. By the way now that we
pause a moment to think about it who would want to live in a
churchless town anyway. Children wouldn't be safe outside the
home, business would go to smash, moral and religious matters
would exist at its lowest ebb, the respectable people would all
move away and the name of the town would become a joke.
A church attending people make a. town the opposite to a
churchless town. Nearly everybody believes that the Christian
church is absolutely necessary to our civilization. If its existence
were threatened, the great mass of the people would fight for it,
but every non-attendant upon religious services virtually votes
for the elimination of the institution from society. Kindred
failures in ones duty to society is absenteeism from the ballot-box
and absenteeism from church. The church stands for the best
things. The church-goqf lines up with the forces which make for
righteousness and we would suggest that an increasing enthusiasm
be shown our local churches from now on by every family
establishing a "Go-to-Church" principle in continuous action the
Lyear through.

PRIZE WINNERS IN
IRONTON CORN AND
POTATO SHOW
In spite of the unfavorable weather,
the corn and potato show at Ironton
Grange hall, Nov. 17th, was well at
tended and much interest was aroused
by the contests. Members of the Char
levoix Commercial Ass'n attended in a
body, coming up the lake by boat. Mr.
R. O. Bisbee of East Jordan drove up
thru the storm and declared that the
show was well worth coming to see.
There were thirty-one entries in the
corn contest and ten entries in the
potato contest. The entries, as a rule,
were very good. Many of the contest
ants, however, were boys and girls
with no experience in preparing ex
hibits for show. As the judges explain
ed the reasons for awarding the prizes
as they did, these young farmers will
be in a much better position to select
prize-winning samples another year.
The educational value of contests of
this sort is the best reason for promot
ing and supporting them. Parents
who took no part in this contest, nor
encouraged their children to compete,
missed a fine opportunity for interest
ing the boys and girls in the world's
biggest business the big business of
modern farming.
In the corn contest Breezy Point
farm won first place in the yellow dent
class with Minn. 13. Emil Nasson sec
ond with Reid's yellow dent. Mrs.
Earl Clark won the special prize for
the best single ear with a fine sample
of Early Rochester.
In the white dent class Edward
Hammond won first place. Mary Weldy
second. Oakley Saunders showed the
best single ear.
Ole Lyngklip won first prize in the
white cap dent class. Joe Courier
took second place and also showed the
best single ear.
In the pop corn class Willard Bird
won first with White Rice and Harold
MacMulkin second. Lillas Flanders
took first prize with black pop corn
and Oral Lewis second.
In the potato contest, early varieties,
Jerry Saunders took the first prize
with Early Six Weeks and Geo. Mac
Mulkin second with Early White Rose.
With late varieties, russet class,
Breezy Point farm won first place with
Petoskey Russets and Lillas Flanders
second with same variety. In the white
potatoes, Edward Hammond easily won
first prize with Rural New Yorker No.
4. and Vaughan Orvis got second with
Noxall.
The corn was judged by B. J. Hol
comb' of East Jordan. Messrs. Joe
Courier, John Nasson and Ole Lyngklip
awarded the prizes on potatoes.
Testimonial
Dear Doctor: I am truly grateful for
the results your most wonderful medi
cine brought to me. My kidneys had
so weakened my back that I was un
able to climb the stairs to my bedroom,
but after taking three bottles of your
splendid preparation my husband put
in an elevator.
(Signed) Mrs. I. R. Well.
Annual High
School Fair
Monday Night
Big Celebration Planned by the
Student Council Should '
Be a Winner.
The annual county fair of ,the high
school will take plaee next Monday
evening, Nov. 27th, at the Armory and
Temple Theatre. This Fair is given by
the Student Council of the school for
the purpose of raising money to sup
port the athletic and debating teams.
The fair will be held in the Armory
and there will be many attractions to
lure the elusive nickle from the crowd.
All kinds of refreshments will be on
sale in booths conducted by the differ
ent classes of the school and there will
be a number of side shows furnishing
plenty of excitement. Admission to the
fair will be entirely free.
Preceding the opening of the fair
there will be a fifteen minute band
concert in front of the Theatre by the
High School Band. A six piece or
chestra will furnish music during the
Fair.
There will be two performances in
the Theatre, beginning at 8:30 and 9:30,
these performances including a forty
minute minstrel show, a gypsy dance,
solos by a boy soprano and moving
pictures of the Ford factory. This
entertainment will be well worth 50c
but the admission will be only 15c for
adults and 10c for children. If you like
to hear good music with lots of life you
should at least attend this show. Then
you should not fail to go up to the
Armory and share in the fun that is
sure to be going on there. The students
of the high school do not very often ask
the patronage of the public and this at
traction is worthy of a crowded house.
Next Monday, Nov. 27th.

Dependents of
Guards Get Aid
Federal Help Will Start This
Month Says Head of the War
Department
Washington, Nov. 21. Dependent
families of all soldiers who are doing
patriotic duty on the Mexican border
ought to be receiving federal aid from
Uncle Sam before the end of this month
according to Major II. M. Lord of the
quartermaster's depot of the war de
partment. After weeks of delay, oc
casioned by neglect and red tape at
both ends of the line, the families are
to receive the assistance to which they
have been, entitled under the law since
Sept. 8, and by right since last June.
The applications of many men have
been received and placed on file, which
means that their families soon will be
receiving support. The final step that
remains before these checks are sent
out is a verification of the applications
with the records of enlistment in the
service. Any families which need aid
and are left out, either have made im
proper applications which have been
sent back for correction or have ne
glected entirely to make the necessary
applications. The news that Uncle
Sam's relief machinery is finally work
ing will be a big relief to the local or
ganization of citizens which undertook
to furnish aid up to the time the gov
ernment funds were available. It
means that they can disband and that
contributions from citizens will no
longer be necessary:
Thanksgiving"
A PROCLAMATION:
BY THE GOVERNOR
"No Man Liveth to Himself Alone."
This declaration is so simple that a child
can understand it. The whole world
frequently contributes to the ingredi
ents of a simple morning meal. The
every-day comforts of life are the con
tribution of many minds and many
hands. Literature, science, art, schools
colleges, universities and churches are
the gifts of the people. Our own United
States, the greatest and noblest nation
on earth, is of the people, as proclaim
ed in that matchless document, the
Declaration of Independence. This
charter of human rights recognizes the
divine in the human. . If it were adopt
ed by the nations of the earth; it would
bring abiding world-peace, prosperity,
and happiness. God has given man
the earth and its manifold riches.
This year, of all the years of this
great Republic, is a fitting time for
thanksgiving. No nation liveth to itself
alone. May we on Thanksgiving Day
remember in our prayers and acts, the
millions of widows and orphans, the
millions of maimed and dying, the
millions of prisoners of war in other
lands. They are our kindred. May
America become a beacon light of liber
ty to all the world.
Therefore, I, Woodbridge N. Ferris,
Governor of the State of Michigan, do
hereby join the President of the United
States in designating Thursday, the
thirtieth of November as a day for all
of the people of this Commonwealth to
celebrate in thanksgiving and prayer.
Given under my hand and the Great
Seal of the State this twenty-fourth
day of November, in the year of our
Lord one thousand nine hundred and
sixteen, and of the Commonwealth the
eightieth.

Making Things Hum in Rome.
The Romans hnd three recognized
methods of applauding the bombus,
the imbrices and the testate. The word
bombus did not carry any allusion to
explosives. On the contrary, this form
of applause was the most decorous, in
asmuch as it consisted merely of a
humming or buzzing noise. Thus in a
way the Romans were the first "to
make things hum" in a public assembly.
The bombus was not the chief feature
the Romans had to offer in the way of
applause. The imbrices meant a dem
onstration made with the hollow of the
hands. The testae meant the striking
together of the flat portions of the
hands. From this we may conclude
that the Romans clapped, but there is
no certainty on this point
