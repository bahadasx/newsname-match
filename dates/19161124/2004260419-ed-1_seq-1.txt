ANOTHER BIRTHDAY
The circuit court took a recess on
Tuesday. The Mist cannot learn the
reason but strongly suspect It wa
because It was the 70th birthday of
Tom Watts, the bailiff. Mr. Watts
was born In St. Louis In 1846, and
located in St. Helen In the year
1862, so he has lived In Columbia
county 64 years. No wonder he
knows everybody and everybody
know "Tom." The Mist wishes Mr.
Watt many happy returns of the
day.

mine which was discovered by Mr.
McKay several years ago. The mine

good quality and burns clean. Sev
eral years ago, so we are informed,
Mr. McKay was hunting in the neigh
borhood of where the mine is and
accidentally discovered a ledgo of
coal. At tho time it was on a rail
road land grant place, so Mr. McKay
covered up the ledge and waited
until a few months ago, when he filed
on it for "mineral rights."
Mr. Van Orshoven, the county
surveyor, states that there is a 6 or
8 inch face to the ledge, and from his
observation he thinks the property
can be developed Into a paying pro
position. No definite plans have been made
for the development of the property,
but a little emore preliminary work
will be done to ascertain the feas
ibility of the project.

to carry their products to foreign
ports, the St. Helens creosoting plant
lias closed. Superintendent Rawson
states that the company has good
prospects for several domestic orders
and he thinks operations will soon
be resumed. A large portion of the
output of the plant has boen shipped
o foreign countries, and with no
tonnage available for these ship
ments the markets of foreign nations
are not open to the local manufac
turers.
The creosoting company now has
000,000 feet of creosoted ties ready

will have to rely on domestic trade
to keep tho plant running.
