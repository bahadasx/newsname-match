Harold Lewis, a Cape County
Boy, Produces 97 Bushels
on One Acre of Ground.
SHANNON COUNTY IS
GIVEN FIRST PRIZE
Eric Palmer of Eminence Gar
nered 107 Bushels From One
Acre Field Crop Slumps.
Harold Lewis, a lo-year old Cape
County boy, won the second prize in
the annual com contest, hold liy the
Cane Normal School, under the super
vision of Seth Babcock, the well-known
agricultural expert.
Farmers living in all sections of t
Southeast .Missouri participated in the
contest. Eric Palmer, of Eminence,
Shannon County, who produced slight
ly more than 107 bushels of corn on
an acre of ground, carried away the
highest honor, according to the list
of awards announced by Prof. Babcock J
last night. Palmer is 20 years old.
Young Lewis, who lives a few miles
southwest of this city, produced 97
bushels of corn on an acre of ground,
which he tilled alone. This lad's rec
ord is remarkable because of his youth
and his inexperience. When he an
nounced that he was going to compete
with the champion farmers of South
east Missouri, his parents told him he
was only wasting his efforts, but they
wished him good luck.
He prepared the ground according
to the rules laid down by Prof. Bab
cock, and he followed the advice of
the Normal expert to the letter in tak- j
ing care of the crop. His success was
the boast of the neighborhood, and
veteran farmers came miles to inspect j
the growing corn and see the youthfuJr;
agriculturist in action.
His acre of corn made his father's
crop look like the work of an amateur.
When the stalks quit growing and be
gan to take on a comber hue, they,
stood like saplings with ears a foot
long hanging two on a stalk.
Prof. P.abcock .stated last night that
Harold was the youngest farmer to
land a prize. The child's efforts came
as a distinct surprise to Mr. Babrock.
Palmer, who captured the first
award, has a reputation as a champion
corn grower. Last year he produced
121 bushels of corn on the sam acre
of ground that grew 107.t this year.
Prof. Babcack stated that there was
a noticeable decrease in the yield in
almost every locality this year as com
pared with the crop grown last season.
This is attributed to the unseasonable
year, which showed a slump in the
production of all kinds of grain
throughout the country.
The yields of the prize winners in
the 1916 contest, as announced by
Prof. Babcock, were:
Eric Palmer's yield was 105 bushels
and 9 pounds; Harold Lewis gathered
in 07 bushels and r'.'.-a pounds of corn.
Matthias Brown of Catawissa, Frank
lin County, 00 bushels; Richard Hop
per of Sikeston, Scott County, 81
bushels and 10 pounds: Fank Yount,
Quaker, Washington County, 76 bush
els and 20 pounds; William Stum
baughn, Jewett, Madison County, 75
bushels and 19 pounds; Claude Ed
wards, Holland, Pemiscott County, 57
bushels and 55 pounds; Samuel Mc
Kee, Zalma. Bollinger County, 56
bushels and " pounds; Ernest Funk,
Annapolis, Iron County, 522 bushels
and 16 pounds; Eric Duncan, Tied
mont, Wayne County, 45 bushels.
ILLMO GIRL OPERATED ON"
Miss Emma Roth Has Appendix Re
moved at Hospital.
An operation for appendicitis was
performed yesterday on Miss Emma
Roth, the daughter of Casper Roth of
lllmo. She is a patient at the St.
Francis Hospital, where the operation
was performed by Dr. L. S. Mayfield,
the family physician.
Miss Roth was brought to the Cape
Wednesday morning, and after an ex
amination it was found that an opera
tion was necessary. The young lady
recovered soon from the effects of the
anaesthetic and is thought to be on
the way of complete recovery. She
is the daughter of a well-known farm

Dr. J. C. Vorbeck yesterday employ
er Sonator Thomas F. Lane and M. A.
j Dempsey, two well-known attorneys.
to defend him against the State Hoard
of Pharmacy, which is endeavoring to
revoke Dr. Vorbeck's certificate to
practice pharmacy
Dr. Vorbeck was given a license to
practice pharmacy by the State Board
in 1901 and practiced under it for
eight years. He permitted his license
to elapse in 190!) by not paying the
j annual tax of $1. He was not prac
ticing pharmacy at the time and per
mitted the matter to go by default.
When he was ready to open the
Vorbeck-Dohogne drag store on Good
Hope street several months ago, he
sent the State Board the amount of
the penalty for permitting his license
lo lapse.together with thetotal amount
of the license for eight years. After
holding this money for a month, the
board returned it to Dr. Vorbeck with
a statement, declaring that he would
have to take another examination. In
the meantime certain druggists in the
Cape furnished the board with the in
formation that Dr. Vorbeck had em-
pioyed a druggist who was not licensed
to prat.tice in this State, and the board
threatened prosecution,
n Vorbprk ,vrole the Dvesident of
the body a letter, inviting him to go
into the courts and test the law. The
physician also declared that lie had
no intentions of taking the examma
tion. "If I was a druggist when 1
began the proctice of the profession in
1001, I must be just as competent to
practice
it now," Dr. Vorbeck con-
tended.
He also says that the action of the
board is prompted by spiie work on
the part of certain individuals in this
city.
Dr. Vorbeck last night issued the fol
lowing statement, explaining his posi
tion: "The State Board
of Pharmacy, j
knowing mat- i am not omy a i"at

tittoner of medicine and surgery, nui
that I was a qualified pharmacist of ,- t w M.,partv 0f Cairo 111.

before their present law, which the
druggists' association slipped through
the State Legislature went into effect,
presumes to harass me into a m-j
quishment of my right to practice a J
profession which I not only studied for
but which I actually carried through
with many sacrifices.
"After spending twelve years in lit
erary institutions fitting myself for
the study of medicine and pharmacy,
and walking two miles to college every
day for eight months during three
years, I qualified myself for the prac
tice of medicine, surgery and phar
macy in the State of Missouri. I
qualified in these professions and have
in my possession certificates from the
State of Missouri showing that I have
submitted the proper evidence of my
qualifications to practice them.
"The State Board of Health knows
my ability and accords me the right
to handle and dispense to the public
any drug, poison or medicine under
the sun; but despite the fact that I
also have a certificate as a registered
pharmacist, the members of the State
Board of Pharmacy demand that I
either employ a druggist or permit
them to again examine me or rather
quiz me on the subjects of materia
medica and pharmacy. Why? Be
cause they either are urged or they
are inclined to use their official power
as an engine of malice and spite. The
law permits them to accept the phar
macy certificate I have as an evi
dence of my qualification to practice
pharmacy in the State of Missouri, but
they prefer to arbitrarily oppose this
course.
They prefer to 'weed' me out
in the language of the president of
the board and I take it that this would

Washington. D. C, Xov. 2". An
important move was made today lead
ing to an early decision of the United
States Supreme Court on the validity
of teh Eight-Hour Law, when the
railroads signed an agreement with the
Attorney-General to co-operate with
the Government to rush the case
through the higher courts.
Under this agreement, the repre
sentatives of the railroads will select
from a large number of cases one that
is typical of all issues involved.
All other proceedings will be sus
pended until the Supreme Court has
passed on this case.
The Government agrees to permit
the railroads to make this selection
j themselves. From all indications the
case of the Santa Fe Railroad will be
selected as the test case. The decision
in this case will be universal and be
applied to all others.

I),ck c,aU(le Speak's veteran bird
i dog, which was sent down to the
j Speak farm in Stoddard County to
spend the winter, is dead. The old
pointer was assassinated by a sow,
which he encountered while attempting
to flush a covey of quail last week.
The dog made a stand in a thicket,
while hunting with several boys. When
one of the hunters urged him to flush
the birds, he rushed into the under
brush. He leaped into the bed of a
large sow and her pigs. She seized
Dick before he could get out of the
brush and killed him. The boys made
j an effort to rescue the dog, but the
. enraged hog worked too rapidly for
them.
Dick had been the property of Mr.
Speak since puppyhood. He was ene
of the best hunting dogs in the city.
Mr. Speak sent the pointer to his farm
because the dog. due to old age, was
becoming savage.

PREDICTS COLD WILL SEND
NEGROES SOUTH AGAIN
Atlanta Ga.. Xov. 2". It has been
generally believed in Atlanta that a
large number of negroes had felt the
mysterious call of the North in the
weeks preceding the national election.
The total number from this city alone
is said to be fully 2500 and this is light
as compared with the inroads made on
some sections.
Many residents of this city have re
called a similar exodus of negroes to
the North about ten years ago. These
persons feel confident all the blacks
who have left their homes will find
their way back before many weeks
have passed, for, they say, it was zero
weather that made them return before.
With the coming of snow and freezing
weather conditions it is believed the
negroes will return.
bur Wortman saved his life where
medical attention later would have
failed. He has been pronounced en
tirely out of danger by attending phys
icians. Wortman was spending the day in
the woods with a party of friends. He
became separated from the others and
was unable to attract their attention
when the repile bit him. After cutting
ithe poisoned flesh out he tied the
wound up with his handkerchief and
made his way to a negro cabin nearby.
