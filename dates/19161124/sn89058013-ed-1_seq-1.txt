They who are not missionary
Christians that is, who make no
effort to seud the gospel to others
are dead Christians so far as
their real spiritual life is con
cerned. ' -
1, Jesus was the great and supreme
ly, unselfish missionary' from the
celestial world to, bur earth of sin
and sorrow, and they who have not
his spirit are "declared to be none
of his (Komaua viii 9)
' This gracious gospel is to - be
preached to all uations to all the
worldr and is to be succeeded by
the sitting up of the reign of uni.
versal righteousness, peace and
blessedness. But thereis yet much
to be done before th is glorious
period can be ushered in.

MRS. O'CONN-ER N
GAINS 8 POUNDS
Suffered From Stomach Trouble
and Catarrh for Five or' Six
.Years. . . . . " . y
1 Mrs. John O'Contier, who livfB
at 338 Ea8t Oldham btreet, Knox
viliejTenn., called up theKuhlulau-Chambliss-Dnig
Co. recently and
aaid Bhe wanted to speak to the
Tanlac" man; Vheii M t, JV1 IHb
au8wered the telephone," Mrs.
O'Couner made the following. re
markable aiatemeut: : V " v
"I just wanted you to know, and
everybody else to know, what that
Tanlao,medicine haa done forme.
-Why, I have gained eight poundfl,
already, and have only been taking
it for ten daya; r.l; have joat fiu-,
ished taking the first b'ottle and
have sent Mr, O'Connor back io
the store this morning for another
bottle.N This Tanlao certainly does,
just what you say it will do. 1 be
gan to eat better, sleep better and .
feel better from the very first dose, :
and the change in my condition
has jnst been wonderful. I had a
good doctor before I began, using,
Tanlac, but -he didn't seem to nn-
derstniul mv rnnp. nnd hin mpdiVirm
didnot"beemto do me any good,o
I just set it aside aud didn't use it.
v ?qt the past five or sis years I
have been in a run-down condition
-r:nervous,weak aud at times very
dizzy. I had nervous headache
and indigestion perfectly awful, "
My stomacn wao so weak I coulcWt
djgest the lightest kind of food--. I ,
was nervous and depressed and
slept.yery little.' I had becbmoYo
despoudeut over my, condition 1
thought nothing conld help me.
It certainly, was lucky for me when .
I heard of Tanlac. i It . is not like -any
other medicine I have tried
it seems to soothe my stomach, and
is a floe tonic, too, becauso rqy ap-
petite is good now, and I digest '
what I eat. If anyone had told me'
there was a medicine, on earth that"
wouid make me gain eight pounds
in ten days, I would have thtiught "
tliem crazy. , " ' .
dou't believe there. is another
medicine on earth like Tanlac, My
catarrh is also a great deaj better
in fact, I hardly not ice it any more."

that accomplishes such remarkable
results in Mrs. O'Conner's cafie, m
