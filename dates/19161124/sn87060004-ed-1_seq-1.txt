After Lingering Illness of
Several Months Beloved
Lady Passes Away
FUNERAL SERVICES THURSDAY
Mrs. Annie W. O'Brien, the
boloved wife of Mr, J, Douglas
O'Brien, passed into the great
beyond on Tuesday afternoon at
4-,30 6'clock. Tho kkillod advice
of -her own physician with that
of specialists from Louisville and
Nashville, the mtastrations of
trained nurses, the tondor watch
ing and earnest prayers of her
own loved ones with many
frtends availed nothing, for God
had called and although she
answered tho summons willingly
there is sorrow and sadness in
Earlington, for we will see her
no more. All her life had been
lived here and she was known
and loved by many who had
known her in her infancy, her
tchool dayp, her young woman
hood and her motherhood. In
all there phases of life she wa8
.winsome and dutiful, iu fact her
whole life has been as an open
book and above reproach..
Mrs. O'Brien was the youngest
daughter of tho late P.t Henry
Wbaleu and about fourteen years
ago was unitod in marriage to
Mr.'J. Douglas O'Briou. To this
union, four children have beou
ljorn, thrco of whom eirvivo
their mother, Anule Marie, the
oldest, nine years of age, and tho
baby boy is not yet a year old.
The grief stricken father and lit
tle ones have tha sympathy of
the whole community. M'sses
Mollie, Maggie, E len and Ki ie,
four eistere, and M . Patrick
Whaleu, the elder" brother, were
'dovoted beyond measure to this
youngest sister and it is (vith
iieurta almost brak'tig Mnt they
try to bo resigned to His will.
Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien have nude
their home for a number of years
past with the btothor and sisters
and there the many friends
passed in and out to mingle their
tears and sympathy with the be
reaved. The funeral tu couducted

way to tho live and esteem held
by our people for this good
woman.

'WHAT YOU SAY

Pray don't forget yonr own;
Remember those in homos of glass
Should seldom throw a stone.

But talk of thoio who sin,
Tie batter to commence at home,
And from that point begin..
We have no right to Judge a man
Until he's fairly tried;

Some may have faults and who has

The old as well as young;
Peihaps we may, for aught we know,
Huye flrty to their one.
I'll tell you of a better plan,
And find it works full well
To try my own deftots to cure
Before of others tell.
And though I sometimes ,hope to be
No worse than some I know
My owu shortcomings bid me let
The fanlts ot others go.
Then let us all, when we commence
To slander friend and toe,
Think of the barm one word maV do
To those wo little know.

Don't speak ot others' faults until

THE DANGER
1 OF ILLITERACY
It is gratifying; to'iiote that the ten
dency of tqe age is setting more
strongly to a general education of the
youth of the land. Many states un
able to solve the educational problem
in any other way, have passed com
pulsory schools laws, and in some
localities these, are being enforced.
Needless to say that where such is
the case the results are most gratify
ing. Still there are many sections of our
country where this is not, the case
many sections where ignorance is
still at a premium.
This should not be. No child
should ever be permitted to reach
maturity without being given the
ground work of a liberal education.
Thete can be no greater menace to
the safety to this republic than of
ignorance. It is the father of crime
Jand the mother of treason.
Of late we have been deluged with
argument for national preparedness.
To our way of thinking most effect
ive preparedness that this nation could
attain to would be to see that every
child within its borders is lifted above
the soul paralyzing slough of igno
rance. It would be worth more than
the eniire heavy ordinance of the
Kaiser or all the dreadnaughts of
Britian.
"Vox popuh, vox Dei" is indeed
a noble sentiment, but it true only in
so far as the voice of the people is
the voice of an enlightened, intelligent
pepple. It were a mockery of an om
niscient God to suppose otherwise.
Let us as a people awake to the
great fact that this land can never be
-what the Creator intended it should be
until our people are all intelligent, ed
ucated, well informed citizens.
There are few social or political
problems of whjch ebucation is not
the sure solution.

CALOMEL SALIVATES
AND MAKESYOU SICK
Acts Like Dynamite on a
Sluggish Liver andYou
Lose a Day's -Work
There's no reason why a per
son should take sickening, sali
vating calomel when 50 cents
buys a largo bottle of Dodson,s
Liver Tone a perfect substitute
for calomel-
It is a pleasant, vegetable
liquid which will start your liver
just as surely as calomel, bnt it
doesu'tjnaka you Bick and can
not salivate.
Children aud grown folkr can
take, Dodson's Liver Tone, be
cause it i'b perfectly harmless.
Calomel is a dangerous drug,
It is mercury and attacks your
bones. Take a dose of nasty cal-
oraol today and you will feel weak
sick and nauseated tomorrow.
Don't lose a day's worK. Take a
spoonful of Dodsnn's Liver Tone
instead and yon will wake up
feeling great. Nonore bilious
ness, constipation, sluggishness,
headache, coated tongue, or sour
stomach, Your druggist says if
yon don't find Dodson,s Liver
Tone acts better than horrible cal
omel yonr money is waiting for
yon.
CHILD DIES
The infant child of Mr. and
Mrs. B- B. Hackney, formerly
residents of this city, died in
Nashville Thursday and was car
ried to Madisonville today for
interment, Mrs. H. W. Rogers,
of this place, accompanied Mr.
Hackney and the remains from
here.
We picked ud a daily paper the
other day and noted that England
had won a great victory. In the next
column the Kaiser was sweepine
everything before him. Turning over
a page, we found Russia sweeping
her foes into eternity, and Austria,
Italy and the whole gang exterminat
ing their enemies on every hand Now
if war i? hell, just what is a
war
correspondent?
The cost of print paper conlinnes to
go up, and sooner or later our sub
scription price will have" to hang onto
its coat tails.
