SPECIAL SESSION , OF COUNTY COURT
ACCEPTS COMPROMISE OF G0L0ST0H
' o
Justices Vote Nineteen To Six
teen For Acceptance Of
Proposition
$1,000 PAID IN SETTLEMENT
OF ALLEGED INDEBTEDNESS
Court Was Called In Special
Session For Consideration
Of Matter
At the special session of the
county court last Monday, which
was called by Judge D. T.
Spaulding for the purpose of
considering the proposition of
former judge M. H. Goldston,
offered in settlement of his al
leged account with the county
which it is said accrued during
his term of office, 1910 to 1915,
the offer was accepted by a vote
of 19 to 16.
At the time of Judge Goldston's
retirement from the office he was
indebted to the county something
more than $1,900. ' according to
the auditor's report, this amount
being the unaccounted for differ
ences shown in his office by the
audit of the county's books, and
awing during his administra
tion as 'financial agent for the
comty.
The case has been in Chancery
Court for,a year, and the sum in
settlement was offered by the
former judge, , he says, while
feeling that the audit showed
considerably more than was
feally unaccounted for, he de
sired a settlement rather than
going through the courts.
At the time the shortage was
reported, Judge Goldston and
his friends claimed that such was
not the case, and since that time
there has been considerable
doubt that the office wa3 short
the amount shown by the report.
Many of the 'terns which were
checked as . shortages, it is said,
were never collected and could
never have been collected they
were worthless.
It is claimed by some of Gold
ston's friends that there was no
shortage whatever, and that the
entire amount could be account
ed for by the worthless bonds
and other items that appeared
in the auditor's report.
The Court, after due consider
ation and upon motion of Esq.
B. W. Rushing, accepted $1,000
as settlement in full of the
amount. Goldston to Day the
costs of the suit in Chancery
Court.
The justices voted
proposition as follows.
For Cross, Snow,
Erwin, Humphreys,
'Rushing, Steele, Allen,
Veazey, Lyon, Edgar,
on the
Pierce,
Dowdy,
McRee,
Hansel,
Wynn, Thompson, French, Alex
ander, Tyson. 19.
Against Hartsfield, Riley,
Brite, Atkins, Morris, Ligon,
Patterson, Mabry, Hodge, Boden,
Huddleston, Coleman, Ross, Cul
pepper, Orr, Hooper. -16.
In the opinion of many, the
Court is to be commended for Us
action in accepting settlement in
.this manner, for, it is pointed
r it, the county can use this
money to much better advantage
than they could have done by
entailing the expanse of a long
legal tangle.

HELPS TO IKE
BRIGHTER FOR ALL
And Paris, Following Custom
of Many Cities, Will Have
One This Year
EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE
COUNTY INVITED TO ASSIST
Will Be Located In Heart Of
the City. Just Opposite
Post Office
Paris is to have a "Communi
ty Tree" this Christmas.
The arrangements are almost
completed, and have already
taken definite shape. Christmas
night-Monday, December 25
is the date announced for the
festival.
The tree will be located on
Market street, directly opposite
the post office. The committee
will furnish the tree and every
thing necessary to make it
beautiful; the city of Paris will
furnish the lights for it, and the
entire population of the city and
county will be expected to fur
nigh everything 'else necessary
to make it a success.
All singers in Paris and Henry
county are requested to be pres
ent and join .in the songs and
Christmas carols, and to other
wise contribute to the spirit of
the occasion.
What is a "Community Tree"?
It is everything that the word
implies-and more. It is a tree
for the community, excluding no
one. Its object is to contribute
to the spirit of pepce and good
will of the season to cheer the
lonely and friendless.
The idea of the Community
Tree, or "Tree of light," origi
nated years ao with an Ameri
can student in Germany. It was
a lonely holiday for him. and one
which he never forgot. Years
later he described it to a friend
in New York and a tree for the
community, in Madison Square,
the very heart of the city, was
the result. And since then the
"Tree of Light" has become an
annual Christmas party, the idea
has spread, and today all over
ihe country, cities, towns and
villages have a. "Community
Tree."
No gifts are distributed from
the tree except music and light
and there's enough of that for
everybody.
The object of the tree in this
city will be the same as those of
other cities to arouse communi
ty spirit; to bring to all its mes
sage of good will and-friendliness
and gladness; to distribute
the Christmas cheer to N all the
city instead of boxing it up at
home and serving it to none but
your family.
