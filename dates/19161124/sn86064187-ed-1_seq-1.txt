been appointed grand chamberlain of
the imperial court, retaining his func

the empire.
Explanation Required.
Petrograd newspapers say the ap

plies the necessity that the government
make a communication to parliament
explaining the impending problems con
nected with work of the government.
The council of the empire has been
adjourned by imperial ukase until De

Liberal Element Wins.
The retirement of Premier' Sturmer
anil the appointment of M. Trepoff as
his successor' probably are outgrowths
of what has Veen referred to in a few
carefully censored Petrograd dispatches
as a serious political crisis. The change
apparently implies a victory for the lib
eral elements of Russia over the bu
reaucratic regime for M. Sturmer al
ways has been prominent in the af
fairs of the Russian bureaucracy, while
M. Trepoff in the past has enRSged
in a variety of reform work.
