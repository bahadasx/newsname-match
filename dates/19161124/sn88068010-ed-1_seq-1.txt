Mary E. Emmerich vs Charles
- Lamkin Escaped Injury
Last week as C. F. Lamkin
was returning from Triplett in a
two horse livery rig owned by
Adams & Garnett he : drove
against a pole of the Bell Tele
phone Co. on the west side of
the dump running north along
the Friesz land west of town. ,
Mr. Lamkin investigated in
the semi-darkness and saw more
poles leaning over the road
ahead. He undertook to lead
the team to the top of the dump
which was very steep and high.
When on the side of the dump,
the wire between the leaning
poles which had caught on the
buggy top, pulled the top off the
buggy. This frightened the
team and the horses lunged for
ward. Mr. Lamkin to avoid be
ing tramped to death or suffer
ing great bodily injury, jumped
aside and let the team take its
course.
fhe horses tore the buggy to
nieces and ran to town, circled
about and alarmed pedestrians,
then went to their barn "while
Mr. Lamkin was plodding his
way home. Had he remained in
the buggy and been there when
the tOD was jerked off he would
have had some skidding.
8-hour Law Contested
Many railroads are resisting
the 8-hour law emergency act of
congress and a suit has been ad
vanced to the Supreme Court of
the United States to test its con
stitutionality. .
California For Wilson
The secretary of state for Cal
afornia refuses to issue an elect
ion certificate to the Wilson elec
tors until, as he says' certain ir
regularities in Yuba ahd Orange
counties are corrected, and yet
the returns from the whole state
show that the lowest Wilson el
ector received 1242 more votes
than the highest Hughes elec
tor. The 13 votes are necessary
to the election of Mr. Wilson.
Judge Hughes tendered Presi
Wilson his congratulations Wed
nesday evening.
In his telegram Mr. Hughes
said:
"Because of the closeness of
the vote I have awaited the offi
cial count in California, and now
that it has been practically com
pleted permit me to extend to
you my congratulations upon
your re-election. I desire also
to express my best wishes for a
successful administration." '
Col. Roosevelt has quit talk:
and therefore has nothing to s y.

Thanksgiving.
. . . By Douglass Mattock.
We may be shy of cannon and we may be short of guns,
We may not have as many men as many other ones.
We may require a fort or two, some infantry and horse,
A little' more artillery to back them up, of course;
But in one matter we have not a reason to be scared
For, when it comes to pumpkin pies, we surely are prepared!
We may be short of men of war and shy of submarines,
And low in mines and other subterranean machines;
We ought to have an aeroplane, or, maybe two or three,
To nest among the mountain tops or hydroplane the sea;
We havo't any instruments for shooting poisoned gas
. But we can beat the universe at making appfe sass!
We have the pumpkins and we have the pippins big and fine;
And, if you want preparedness, pie paredness for mine!
If someone sails across the sea America to try,
We'll shoot them full of apple sa ts and full of pumpkin pie
I bet they'll throw their guns away, beneath the magic charm
And settle in America and buy them each a farm!
State Teachers Meeting
There were about ten thous
and teachers in Mo. registered
at the State Teachers Associa
tion meeting at St Louis last
week, but many from every
section of the state failed to
attend. There were a number
of teachers from other states
with reputations who were on
the program. County Supt
CarlBtead regards the meeting
as one of the most beneficial to
teachers ever held in the state.
The next meeting will be held
in Kansas City Nov. 1917. ,
Bought Law Library t
. Attorney Louis Merrill bought
the Capt J. C Wallace law libr
ary and together with Lud wig
Kinkhorst took it to Brunswick
in the Kinkhorst truck Monday
afternoon.
This is a fine library of itself,
but added to the law books al
ready in Mr. Merrills collection,
he can feel fully equipped for
the practice of his profession.
Deutchland Detained
The German Submarine which
has made three trips with freight
to and from this country to Ger
many, was detained by the legal
proceedings brot about by the
Deutchland sinking a tug as she
started to leave this country last
week. She ran into the tug and
sunk it and five on the tug were
drowned. Bond has been fur
nished and the submarine de
departed for her ' hme port
Wednesday, getting awav clear.
' Hon. W. W. Rucker left for
W. Virginia today for a few days
visit at his old home when he
will go to his post in .Washing
ton. . . . V '
Marion Veatch has the -half
guinney-half chicken - hybrids
raised by Osie Perkins, i They
are singular . looking fowls, re
sembling a turkey buzzard more
than either chicken or guinea.
; Walter Wilkerson has sold his
farm near ' Roth ville to Joseph
Bible of Carroll Co. : Mr Wilk
erson will probably locate in the
south. All his many friends in
the county will regret the loss
of so estimable citizen, but com
mend him most highly to what
ever community he may go.
Hon. Paul F. Prosser who
made the speech of the evening
at the big rally here last week,
is among Missouri's greatest ora
tors. , Numbers of those - from
the country who heard him were
more than pleased and instruct
ed. Mr. Prosser is rcall a
Chariton County boy and we are
justly proud of his achievement
Prepared
Sante Fe To Extend
It is a fixed fact that the Sante
Fe Railroad will extend its line
from Carrollton to St Louis in
connection with the Burlington
road.
Terminals have been secured
in St Louis and surveying is
pushed to make ready for build
ing road bed in the spring over
whatever route is regarded most
'desirable. A survey has been
completed placing the route about
two and one half miles south of
town. . Another resurvey will
run thru the north side of town
anq etill another to run north of
Brunswick ' about 3 miles and
Aoouta mile north-of' Keytes
ville.'. It may be that the Sante
Fe will use track and bridge
from Carrollton to Dean Lake.
; Basket Ball
K. H. S. played Salisbury High
School last Friday and lost 2 to
13. Brunswick played Prairie
Hill H. S. at Salisbury Saturday,
Brunswick 13, P. Hill 10.
Brunswick has won the cham
pionship honors in the first divi
sion and Dalton is easily winner
in the second for girls. The fact
is that Dalton should be in the
first division and the champions
in the county.
Mendon has easily the cham
pion team in the second division
of boys. We have in our girls
team the making of a champion
ship club and we will realize it
in a short time.
- While going thru the country
last week we saw a cat on
' m
garden ienceana a salmon can
over its nead. bucn antics as
the cat cut trying to see out o:
the can and stick to the top of
the fence at the same time were
deeply amusing to another cat
on the ground as well as to other
bystanders. The owner of the
feline undertook to pull the can
off and was rewarded by being
scratched. We lent a hand and
while one got hold of the cats
tail on one side of the fence the
other grabbed the can on the
other and a vigorous pull in op
posite directions released the cat
from the can or the can from
the cat and the cat lost no time
in getting off the fence.
, Deutschland Gone Again
The German undersea freight
er without attempt at secresy,

full cargo Tuesday. ' No report

sumed she is clear of any hostile
craft. . : . -

Guy Westenkehler, Mrs. Sarah
Garhart and W. A. Johnson.
R. A. Gehrig and family have

A good rain fell here last Tues
day night and Wednesday and
filled up the wellc and ponds. .
The finishing touches are be
ing put on the Mcuurry and
Piltz building and the end can
now be seen approaching.
When corn sells for cne dollar
a bushel, owners shooting at mid
night prowlers helping them
selves to the stale, are apt to
aim too high, as Will Draper,
rural mail carrier on route 5 i
few nights ago, when he punctur
ed the air instead of the thief,
who dropped his sack and 65
years of corn and flew. The
revolver shots which followed
accelerated, instead of slacken
ing the speed of the sprinter,
and he made good his escape. A
stick of dynimite placed in
shock may bring better results.
Lean calves are more inevi
dence than ever before. But
no one is anxious to buy while
feed is so high.

: Austria's Emperor Dead
Emperor Franz Joseph died
Wednesday night aged 86 and
with a record for the longest
reign of any Monarch. For 68
years he has been the ruler o:
Austria.
Since the assassination of his
heir to the throne by Serbians
which was the act which precip
itated the war, Emperor Franz
Joseph has lost vigor and several
times his death was expected.
Archduke Charfes Francis was
slated for the throne and to as
sume the position Dec. 2.

Germany's Submarine Activity
Increased. Allies Mount Mer
chantmen. Situation Acute
It has developed that Ger
many intends to destroy all ships
carrying contraband of war,
whether such ships are hostile
or neutral. The Allies have lost
a number of merchant ships dur
ing the past week and it is learn
ed that Germany has a great
number of new submarines which
she will send out against all
ships carrying supplies to either
of the Allies.
Great firitian expects to mount
a gun fore and aft on her
merchant ships to protect them
against submarines and this
means, that submarines will act
without warning such ships if
it is thot necessary. The sit
uation is critical for President
Wilson sees that the armed ship
will be forced on the United
States by the Allies if the ad
ministration will permit of such
violation of regulations pertain
ing, the attitude of the admin
istration at this time being pos
tively against such attempt by -England.
The situation in this regard,
complicated with the trade open
ed up with this country by Ger
many thru the undersea freight
er method to which England so
vehemently objects, renders the
position of this country a trying
one and President Wilson is
keeping thoroughly informed.
Allies captured some towns and
prisoners in the east and made
advances in the west during the
week, but the Teutons havede-
I mdedhrihy,-ad ragtags M"fea--
caiKan country ana are pus rung
it The proposal of the Germans
to take nearly all the able bodied
Belgian men and put them to
work has met with strong dis
approval by England.
Mexico
The Administration has de
livered an ultimatum to Mexico
to the effect that this country
will persue any and all who cross
the border into this country and
commit any sort of outrage, no
matter how far into Mexico such
culprits have to be followed.
Carranza appears to be unable
to handle the situation and that
he will be ousted soon, there is
little doubt New revolutions
have broken out, rapine and dis
regard for the rights and im
munities of foreigners running
rampant again and the action of
the members of the Mexican
committee selected toco-operate
with a committee from this coun
try has been such as to indicate
indifference to peace. Under the
existing circumstances, Presi
dent Wilson has decided to take
immediate and drastic measures
if conditions are not speedily
changed.
Shoe Business Exchanged ,
Milt Bennett closed a deal
Saturday for his Shoe Stock with
Ira Hott, the consideration being
the 180 acre farm known as the
Piper place northwest of this
place.
The stock invoiced over $6000
which went as part payment for
the farm.-
ULr. Hott has taken charge of
the store and Mr. Bennett looks
after affaiis connected with the
farm.
The deal was conducted by
J. W. Way land and was made
witnout delay or dissatisfaction.
Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Vosa of
Oscaloosa, Iowa, arrived Tues
day afternoon for a visit to-
relatives.
