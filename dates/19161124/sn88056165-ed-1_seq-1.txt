STATE ROAD
WILL STRIKE US
County Commissioners Ask
For Slight Changes in Sur
vey so Road May Pass
Through Towns.
According to late reports the
north and south state highway
will pass through both Grange
ville and Cottonwood when fi
nally completed. This decision
was reached late last week at
Grangeville when Surveyor
Burns was called before the
board of county commissioners
and a number of citizens and,
after talking the location of the
state highway over at some
length, was asked to re-survey
portions of the road so as to have
it pass through both of the towns
mentioned.
The fact that the surveyors
have sought to secure the short
est route between Whitebird and
the county line north of Ferdi
nand has caused most of the
route to be laid through the fields
and has caused much antagon
ism among the farmers affected,
and will later result in a very ex
pensive right-of-way. This fact,
together with the fact that the
best interests of the people are
not served by the road missing
the towns by several miles and
the difficulty that would arise in
financing such a road across the
prairie, caused the county board
to ask for a change in the route
to include both towns mentioned
and it is believed the state board
will accept the changes made
when matters are fully explained
to them. The changes wiil do
away with several miles of ex
pensive roads that would other
wise have to be built in the
Grangeville and Tolo country,
and it is possible the road may
follow much of the present road
between Grangeville ahd this
place, thereby doing away with
necessity of purchasing much ex
pensive right of way between
the two towns. North of this
place the road will no doubt
maintain practically the present
route, with possibly a few slight
changes, as the present county
road between this place and Fer
dinand is entirely too rough to be
utilized.
Miss Wagner Showered
The Wagner home in this city
was the scene of a very enjoyable
party Wednesday evening when
more than thirty friends sur
prised Miss Helen with a mis
cellaneous shower in honor of her
approaching wedding. The
guests descended on the home in
a body and took Miss Helen com
pletely by surprise but she soon
recovered and made all welcome
and the evening was passed very
pleasantly with games and music,
Five Hundred was played at
seven tables, Miss Minnie Lange
winning first prize, a very dainty
sugar bowl and cream pitcher,
and Miss Theresa Funke second
prize, a fruit dish. The prizes
were then given to Miss Helen,
who was also showered with
many dainty and useful gifts
suitable for her new station in
life. Lunch was served at a late
hour, after which the guests de
parted wishing the bride-to-be
all kinds of happiness in future
years.

Joseph. The deceased ruler had
reigned over his kingdom for 68
years.
Beans Paid Poor Man
Peck, Nov. 21.—-In the spring
of this year a man called on Mr.
Steele of Central Ridge inquiring
for "bean ground," with the re
sult that Mr. Steele rented him
forty acres, supplying everything
even to living expenses, board,
room, etc., for the man and his
wife. The conditions were that
Mr. Steele and the man should
share equally in the crop.
The man proved to be a worker
of the whirlwind type. He hoed
beans from daylight to dark
working out for his neighbors in
the spare time.
Several times during the sea
son the man (who was no farmer
by the way) tried to make a deal
with Mr. Steele whereby the
latter should take the beans off
his hands owing to his getting
discouraged with the weather,
etc., offering to sell his share at
one time for $200 and later for
$300.
Mr. Steele, however, gener
ously pursuaded the man to hold
on with the result that at the
settlement recently made the
man has $1,200 practically clear
money, the beans realizing just
about $60 an acre.
Truly this is a poor man's
country and we ought to have no
poor as there are opportunities
similar in abundance in this sec
tion.
Rehder Sale Proved a Big One
The sale held last Friday at the
Henry Rehder farnrwest of town
drew a nice crowd and every
thing sold at very satisfactory
prices, the sale totaling right
around the $4500 mark. The
cattle brought nice prices, milk
cows selling for $75 to $91 dollars,
and the young stock in propor
tion. Harry C. Cranke, the
Spokane auctioneer who cried
the sale, showed his ability as an
auctioneer and disposed of all
the property at good prices and
was back in town by five o'clock
that evening. Mr. Rehder was
more than pleased with the re
sults of the sale and says it
would have totaled more than
$5,000 had he not held out the
hay and one or two animals. Mr.
Cranke made a fine impression
with the local public and will no
doubt secure other sales here in
the spring.

COTTONWOOD
GROWING FAST
Spent More Money For Im
provements This Year Than
Any Other Town in Upper
Country.
The walls of Cottonwood's new
$10,000 brick garage building
are now completed and the work
of putting on the roof and put
in the windows and front is un
der way. Within a short time
the building will be ready to re
ceive machinery and supplies.
The new building makes a fine
appearance on Main street and
adds much to the appearance of
the business section of the city.
When fully equipped the garage
will be one of the best in the
Lewiston country.
With two new flour mills, a
new elevator, a new creamery, a
$10,000 garage, a new concrete
business block, two large imple
ment houses, several new lumber
sheds and several residences,
Cottonwood can lay claim to hav
ing expended more money for
improvements this year than any
other town in the upper country.
And the end is not yet. Watch
out for continued improvements
next year and perhaps a good
chunk of street paving. Cotton
wood is perhaps the best town
south of Lewiston and is destined
to forge rapidly to the front dur
ing the next few years. It has
the country and people back of it
to make it the leading town of
central Idaho, which it is certain
to become as time passes. Watch
and see.
Confirmation Services
Were Fine
Rt. Rev. Bishop A. J. Glorieux,
of Boise, arrived in the city
Tuesday evening and on Wednes
day morning administered the
sacrament of confirmation to a
class of about sixty children of

at 9:30 o'clock at the Catholic
church when the confirmants,
followed by Rt. Rev. Bishop and
Rev. Fathers Wiilibrord, Philip
and Martin, marched from the
school building to the church.
Holy mass was read by Father
Willibrord, assisted by Fathers
Philip and Martin, after which
confimation was given the child
ren, several grown persons also
receiving the sacrament. Bishop
Glorieux delivered a very inter
esting lecture to those confirmed
and the services throughout were
very edifying, the large church
being filled by people who had
come to attend the services.
Bishop Glorieux departed again
yesterday morning for his home
in Boise.

County Commissioner I. H.
'Lowrey, of Winchester, the well
.known breeder o f Clydesdale
horses, last week sold the coming
two year old stallion, Idaho
Stamp, to the Idaho University.
This young beauty won junior
championship at the Northwest
-Livestock show in Lewiston last
year and was selected by the
Univerity Agricultural College to
head their class in draft horses
and for use as their model in
stock judging, showing, etc.
He is a fair sample of the Clyde
stock Mr. Lowrey handles and on
which he has taken premiums at
many shows in the Northwest.
At present he has 24 head of this
olas3 of animals, and it is to such
men as him that Lewis county
and the Lewiston country is in
debted for the reputation they
are gaining in the world of high
er-class live stock.—Nezperce

Mat Pederson, of Keuterville,
also owns a fine Clydesdale pur
chased from Mr. Lowrey and
which has won prizes wherever
ahown. It carried off grand
champion honors at the local fair
and stock show last October.
Idaho Leads In Beet Seed
Culture In United States
Thomas R. Cutler, manager of
the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company,
returning from a visit to Colo
rado, where he went to consult
with the other officials of the
United States Beet Seed com
pany, reports that as a general
thing, the beet experiments in
Idaho were more satisfactory
than those conducted in any other
section and believes that in time
the United States will be an ex
porter instead of an importer of
beet seed.
The three companies in Utah
and Idaho have paid for approxi
mately 60 per cent of their en
tire crop, all deliveries up to
October 31st being settled for
November 15 by the offices in
Salt Lake, Ogden and Layton.
The Utah-Idaho will pay the
beet farmers close to $2,000,000,
the Amalgamated Sugar $1,350,
000, the Layton Sugar company
approximately $200,000 a total of
about $3,500,000, which reaches
the pockets of the beet farmers
at the period of the year when
its arrival is the most welcome.
Just to remind you that Cotton
wood has a 5c and 10c store.
John Bies this week sold his
farm northeast of town to Mat
Duclos, of this place, for $10,
000 .
Since the discovery that Pete
Johnson was missing out at Buf
falo Hump the efforts put forth
by a searching party to find him
have proved fruitless and there
is little doubt that he has joined
the list of those who failed to
survive the dangers of the primi
tive mountain life. There is no
probability that the body will be
found before spring as day by
day the snow blanket back in
that country has been getting
deeper and deeper and will frust
rate any effort to locate the place
where he is laying.—Free Press.

Notice
Owing to the fact that patrons
of the local post office, particul
arly those who patronize the ;
general delivery, remain in and
crowd the lobby of the office
from the time the train arrives
until the mail is distributed, to
such an extent that others, es
pecially ladies, are reluctant to
enter and work through the
crowd, and that the attendant
noise and confusion greatly re
tard the distributing of the mail
and the tobacco smoke becomes
stifling unless the practice abates
it will be necessary to close the
lobby during the distribution of
the evening mail, in accordance
with provision of the postal
laws and regulations.
Repeated complaints have been
lodged because of this tendency,
but action has thus far been de
ferred because of reluctance to
inconvenience those patrons who
are not responsible for the above
stated conditions.

Postmaster.
