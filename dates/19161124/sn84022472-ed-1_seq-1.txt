Additional Annual Capital of
Billion and a Quarter to

Washington, Nov. 24 Railroads wiU

annually for the next ten or twelve
years to increase their facilities to
handle the country's growing com
merce, Alfred P. Thom, ' counsel . for
the railway executives' advisory com
mittee, . told ,the Congressional rail
road investigating committee .today,
continuing his statement on , behalf of
the railroads begun yesterday. . '
About $250,000,000 .a year additional
will be required, he said, -to refund
maturing indebtedness.
To attract investors; Mr. .Thom sug
gested that federal regulation should
replace the present system of author
ity divided between the states and the
central government. ,
"Referring to the need of additional
railroad facilities, Mr. Thom said: ,
"It has been found that the wealth
of the country has been increasing at
the rate of 8 or 9 per cent, a year and
thfe same ratio of increase has" held
good as to the demand for transporta
tion. As the forces which have af
fected the : growth and development
of the past apparently still continue
in full operation, and may1 reasonably
be expected to continue for the next
ten or fifteen years at least the invest
ment in railroad facilities -to meet the
.large requirements of he future must
consequently grow at a corresponding
rate, of increase. The .estimate of $1,
250,000,000 for 1 additional transporta
tion facilities Includes nothing for ex
tensions into new territory," he added.
"Where" is this money or arty sum
approximating it to come from?" asked
Mr. Thom. "This problem is of vital
interest' to the public v because . on its
successful solution depends the com
mercial .facilities of the country. '
; "Would it do to confront the inves

are fixed and. limited not only by gov

Nine barges and their cargoes val

in the Sound or strewn on the beach
at Fairfield. There is a possibility of
salvaging one overturned pig iron
barge and one boat loaded with sand,
"how high on the beach.
The tugs John Garrett and Robert
McAllister, which stood off "Fairfield
today, returned to port with reports
that pulling the two surviving wrecks
off the beach today is an impossibility.
Seventeen persons were rescued in
the teeth of a gale in one of the most
perilous Sound trips recorded for
many months, ; some of whom '. nar
rowly escaped death in New York two
days ago as a tugboat lying alongside
their barges blew up with great loss
of life.
Reports, brought to . this port from
New Haven and along the coasit indi

Blakeslee, from Pine Skrcharcr to New
York with trap rock, lost three barges

The rescued bargemen . and :. their
wives will be returned to New York
as soon, as possible, having lost their
entire belongings, with the exception
of a. few doss. Some of the captains
were owners of their boats, the total
value of which is not definitely known.
One boat load of pig iron was des

the Elm - Automobile Company of
Bridgeport, Joseph Rozgonyi, a well
known photographer in the West End,
living at 322 Spruce street, has been
arrested in New York. ,
The arrest which . was made by
Frank Virelli, under direction of the
Connecticut state police department,
is said .to .be the start of a campaign
designed to break up, the practice of
buying-Vcars 'on the installment plan
in this state and then taking them
elsewhere for sale.
-Rozgonyi, who is an expert retouch

has a large following -in that section
of the West End inhabitedv by the
Hungarian people. After leaving these
parts he went to New York and was
apprehended! yesterday by Ppliceman
Virelli in the White Photographic stu

noted society and theatrical studios In
the metropolis. He was . residing at
420 East 81st street. ,
Extradition papers for his return to
Fairfield where he will 'be placed on
trial, have already been applied for
and .will be presented at once to Gov.
Whitman at Albany. Rozgonyi is al
leged to have purchased a 1914 . Over

said to have paid all but $133 in instal

himself as the owner, of the car to
Mr. Beach who was induced to buy it
for cash.
When ownership was .shown to be

another boat off the reef two months

spirits.
Before being- taken in tow for New
Haven, the Louis was lying at New
town creek in Brooklyn, two boats dis

blew up, supposedly from dynamite
placed in her coal bunkers. Captain
Ridge, with his mate, Cal Taylor, were
in the cabin of their boat at. the time.

Instructions." Boyer in the meantime
was becoming suspicious of his' peusdo
employer and went the next morning
and called the firm in New York by
phone. They didn't . know Champion
and advised Boyer to see a doctor.
With fire In .his eye Boyer returned
to -the lodgings in the Park House,

which read, "I have taken your trunk

agreement as it stands, however, even
after, certain modifications had been
made unless sanctioned by Carranzaj

should render a report in person.
