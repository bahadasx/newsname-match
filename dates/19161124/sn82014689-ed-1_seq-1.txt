Natural Beauty Of Scene Is Animated By Scores
Of Busy Workmen Who Are Engaged
In Placing Many Exhibits.
With the white tops of the tents standing out in broad relief
against the green of the surrounding cane fields and hedge, the Maui
Fair grounds took on an additional appearance of beauty this week,
which was animated by scores of active workmen engaged in arrang
ing the exhibits which arrived early. "The stage for the big show is
now nearly set," says Manager Cameron.
From Monday until today, the men of one Honolulu exhibitor,
the Theo. Davies Company, have been' busy putting together and plac
ing in position, a great collection of modern machinery. This exhibit
in bulk, will be one of the greatest on the grounds, and it is being plac
ed in one of the largest tents. E. O. Hall and Son has had a man on the
grounds, also, since early this week, taking the initial steps toward mak
ing a big exhibit.
All during the week other exhibitors, or their representatives have
been arriving and Manager F. B. Cameron and Chairman Wadsworth
have been kept figuring and refiguring to meet the demand, for space.
By careful elimination and use of all available space, it now seems that
there will be room for all, excepting, perhaps, those who wait until the
last day or two to try and get reservation.
Even Maui people have been making exclamations of wonder at
the maenitude the fair seems to be approaching, and there is constant
surprise shown by strangers. The
have been growing so in number during the last few days that :t is
believed it will be necessary and advisable to close the grounds to all
except exhibitors and workman on Tuesday of next week, two days
before the show really begins. Tomorrow and Sunday will be about
the last opportunity to see the fair, (in course of construction.
The lumber construction work has progressed with wonderful
strides in the last two or three days. The pens for Daisy, the elephant,
and the waterbuffalo, are already attracting attention from the youngst
ers, who are making well the location for an early dash to that spot,
on their first visit to the grounds after the show starts.
Through the assistance of the county supervisors and the sheriffs
department additional labor, which was badly needed, was secured Jy
putting a gang of prisoners to work on the grounds.

lu to cover any possible ac
cident that may beset Daisy on
her Maui trip. She la expected
to arrive here several days be
fore the fair, but will be given
a rest of several days, far from
curious eyes, so she may with
stand the ordeal of being rode
and fed by all the Maui "ktjd
dies." n-
Abundant proof of the bound to be
success of the Maui County Fair was
given yesterday, when nearly thirty
heads of Maul business enterprises
gathered in the Town Hall for the fin
al general meeting of the various
committees. It was the largest and
most enthusiastic meeting of the
chairmen held since the Inception of
the fair.
Progress was reported by every
chairman present, in realty the re
ports were nearly all of the consuma
tion of efforts of the committeemen.
Without exception, it developed that
all the chairmen and their helpers
had attended to the duties which had
been assigned to them and that there
remained only the gathering in of a
few loose ends of details. A more
satisfactory report could not have
been expected, if the committeemen
had been high salaried men who had
been devoting their entire time to the
building of a big exposition.
That the attendance is expected to
be large, even by the pessimistic ones
who have to look after the financial
end of the fair, was indicated when
one of the finance committee declared
that he did not know where space for
the exercises on the grounds would be
found to accommodate the crowd.
This remark warf mdde after principal
McClusky had stated that there would
be 2000 children in the school parade
on Children's Day. "There are seve
ral hundred other children who would
attend if there was some way to get
them here," he added.
The Lahaina committeeman report
ed that the west end of the Island
had so many pople who were going to
be present that it was a Lahaina pro
blem to find machines enough to con
vey them here, even though all the
big trucks of the Pioneer Mill Planta
tion Company are to be used.
Another optimistic expectation of
big attendance was shown when Su
perintendent Walsh of the Kahulul
railroad said the schedule had already
been prepared which would, bring
trains into Wailuku almost every hour
during the. fair. These trains will
run evenings up until midnight.
Regular fares have been cut in half
for the fair dates, and in some instanc
es much lower, x '

tions will be equally- good, as
there will be returning steamers
on Friday and Saturday even
ings. By the opportune arrival of

Tuesday morning, the Manoa's
Maui call will have all the ad
vantage of a special excursion
service. The Manoa will leave

Maui Is Ready To
Welcome Guests
Great preparations are being made
by Maui citizens to entertain visitors
who come to their county fair Thanks
giving Day. Daniel H. Case, of Wal
luku has made a special trips to Hono
lulu as ambassador plenipotentiary to
extend Maui's greetings to Oahu and
bid all welcome, reports the Adver
tiser. The particular business that bro
ught Mr. Case to the metropolis was
to charter a fleet of steamers, if
necessary. However, this will not be
necessary, because the Mauna Loa,
Mauna Kea, Manoa and Kilauea are
all going to make trips in the usual
course of events, and those who have
preferences can take their choice.
For the accommodation of the re
turning visitors, the Mauna Loa,
Mauna Kea and Manoa will land pas
sengers back in Honolulu Saturday
and Sunday. The Mauna Loa is now
on the Claudine run.
As to hotels, Wailuku can take care
of 250 visitors without asking anyone
to sleep in the bathtubs or on the bil
liard tables, and as many more in pri
vate homes. In fact, Mr. Case said
Maul can take care of a big crowd
comfortably.
The Grand Hotel is complete as to
furniture and fixtures, although some
of the windows have not arrived, but
everybody sleeps with their windows
ajar in Wailuku and there are no mon-
quitos, except an occasional specimen
brought on board the steamers from
Honolulu. Anyway, the Grand will be
ready for guests during fair week.
The Governor will be there, and many
distinguished visitors.
The Maui Hotel has recently been
enlarged and completely renovated.
While these inns are Maul's best, there
are other hostelrles besides. Maui in
tends to have "one big time" from
Thursday to Saturday. A special
watch committee representing the
Maul chamber of commerce guarantees
that there will be no gouging of visit
ors by auto men, hack drivers, restau
rateurs, promoters and others during
fair week. Maui Is opulent and can
afford to give all visitors a good time.

Spirit Assures
Show's Success
Maui Citizens Take Hold
Plans With Live And Credit
able Enthusiasm.
Of
By RILEY H. ALLEN
Editor or the Star-Bulletin.
Maui County's first annual fa'r, to
lie held at Wailuku on November 30,
December 1 and 2, wilK be the great
est the territory has seen.
So much advance plans and prom
ises indicate, and Maui does not fall
down on plana or fail to make good
on promises. The men and momen of
the Valley Isle have the habit of put
ting through to an unquestioned suc
cess whatever public undertaking they
are called upon to attempt.
The fair at Hilo, with which Ha
waii County began what may be a
yearly series, was a good beginning.
Pioneering the way, venturing into
new territory, so to speak, the Hawaii
people arranged a two-day event, after
wards lengthened to three days, and
more than 15,000 people passed
through the gates. The fair was a
financial success and a success also
in its showing of exhibits.
Maul Is planning a fair larger event,
wider In scope, and with many of the
traditional "county fair" features
which Hilo was unable to arrange.
Maui has had two additional months
of preparation, and sent a delegation
to Hilo with the idea of looking at the
Hawaii County Fair and profiting by
Its experiences.
Site is Big Asset
The site chosen by the committee
in charge Is a big asset in favor of
the Maul event. The Wailuku base
ball feld wa3 nelected as the most
suitable spot. It provides abundant
room not only for the exhibit, com
mercial and otherwise, but. leaves
rlentv of accommodation, for amuse
ment features and facilities for carlns
foi the crowds which are expected to
attend. '
Certainly no county fair ever had a
more magnificent scenic setting. In
this respect the Wailuku field rivals
the famous scenic polo fields of Moa
nalua and Kapiolani park, on Oahu.
The field is flanked on one side by a
wide higway, giving easy access for
vehicles and foot traffic, and on the
others by caneflelds. These fields
strech away almost without interrup
tion to the mountains of Western
Maui, beyond the town of Wailuku,
and on the other side the rolling
slopes of Haloakala that finally merge
into the bulky crater-mountain that
lifts 10,000 feet of looming hills into
the clouds.
Field Will Be Cool and Clean
The baseball field Is being especial
ly grassed, given paths and arranged
for fair purposes. The crowds who
attend will not tramp through dusty
Rlleys and over dusty stretches of
ground, but over soft turf.
A, grandstand, a bandstand and
dancing pavilion and other construc
tion features augment that space allot
ed for exhibits.
One disadvantage found by Mana
ger F. B. Cameron is in the lack of

O. J. Manalo and Miss Ah See were
married at the Paia Cathojic Church
on last Saturday evening. At a wed
ding luau afterward, they were the
recipients of many congratulations and
proffers of best wishes from all the
hundred guests present, as well as in
the speeches of John Medeiros, M. S.
Deponte and Antone Fernandez. Pedro

POISON SPREADER ENDANGERS
LIVES OF SCHOOL CHILDREN
By spreading pieces of bread con
taining strychnine about the building
and yard of a Japanese school at
Keokea the lives of many young
Japanese school children were endang
ered by a vengeful resident of the
district, whose motive seems to have
been to poison the dog of an enemy.
About a week ago eight or ten dogs
died in one night in that district and
since then the police have been in
investlgatioa the matter, as it was
charged by some of the Japanese that
an attempt had been made to poison
the children of the school by some
ant-Oriental fanatic. This was after
the bread was found early one mornr
ing by the teacher of the school, who
immediately had all the bits of bread
gathered up, after giving strict warn
ing to the children to not eat it.

Election Amenities
Bob Breckons And Dr. Raymond
Enter Contest Of Polite Sarcasm
Over Senatorial Scrap
Election amenities are not all past
on Maui, even thought Charles
Hughes has congratulated President
Wilson on his reelection, for the cam
paign bitterness of the Cooke-Ray-mond
senatorial fight is still manifest
here In the courtesies which are be
ing interchanged by R. W. Breckons,
Republican national committeeman
for Hawaii, and Dr. J. H. Raymond,
the defeated Defhocratio candidate for
election as senator from Maui.
Breckons recently wrote to Dr. Ray
mond, in a "you may read it any
way you wish manner," congratulat
ing him on his defeat by Cooke. The
letter has aroused full memory of the
senatorial election and is being much
discussed as to whether its intent
was friendly or the reverse. The let
ter from Breckon, which started the
election amenities, was as follows:
"My dear Doctor:
"May I say to you that I am exceed
ingly pleased that you were defeated
in your aspirations for a seat in the
Senate. May I couple this statement
with the further statement that the
pleasure does not come from any per
sonal animosity towards you. As you
know full well, I am a Republican
first, last and always. You know also
that I would scrap with anybody who
sought to come to the legislature as
a Democrat. If we had to have a De
mocrat In the Senate from Maul, I
would as soon see you there as any
body. "I have written to George Cooke
congratulating him on beating you.
I am glad he did IV. I am writing you
to assure you that there was nothing,
as far as I, was concerned, in the na
ture of a personal objection to you.
"Very sincerely yours,
"R. W. BRECKONS."
Dr. Raymond, not to be outdone In
the written exchange of courtesies, re
plied to the letter of the Republican
national committee in a tone which
equals or surpassess that of Breckons
in studied politeness. The doctors'
letter to Breckons is given below:
"My dear Mr. Breckons:
"I am in receipt of your letter of
the 8th instant, and in reply would
say that I accept it in the spirit in
which it was written.
"May I say to you, my one regret is
that I am unable to congratulate Mr.
Cooke upon beating me, for the reason
that I have sufficient knowledge of the
conduction of his campaign by the
manager, Mr. Kalama, to convince me
that as political campaigns go, it was
most disgraceful, and has, I believe,
done more harm to the Territory of
Hawaii, than anything else that has
happened politically wittfin the past
twenty years.
"May I say further, that the result
of the presidential election In return
ing President Wilson to that exalted
office, is a great consolation to me in
this hour of defeat to which you refer;
and I am truly thankful to Our Good
Lord, for having, In His infinite wis
dom, relegated your standard-bearer,
Mr. Hughes, and his various satellites,
not excepting those in Hawaii, to the
political dumping-ground, where they
will remain for four long years In a
state of innocuous desuetude." .
Governor L. E. Pinkham will arive
at Lahaina next Saturday afternoon,
where he will be met by a fair com
mittee and escorted to Wailuku. That
evening he will be the guest of the
Grand Hotel, where a banquet Is to
be given In his honor, and at which
the new hotel is to be formally open
ed.
was a wise one Is now made certain
by the receipt of a letter from the
Honolulu oflice of the territorial
board of health, where the bread was
examined. The letter states that
strychnine in large quantities was
found in the bread, which was given
to W. B. Bairos, the deputy food com
missioner, for analysis.
In a letter to County Attorney Be
vins, the board of health man writes
aa follows:
"In regard to a number of scraps
of bread, submitted by you on Novem
ber 20, 1916, and said to have been
picked up by the police department
of Makawao In the yard of the Japan
ese school at Keokea, Maui, I beg to
state that the same has been analyzed
by this office and found to contain
strychnine in considerable quantity."
