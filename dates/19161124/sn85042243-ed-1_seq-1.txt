WAR GREAT LEVELLER
OF THE SEXES
"Colonel's Lady" and Judy 0'
Grady" Rub Elbows Most
Democratically
By MARGARET MASON.
(Written fo- the United Press).
Oh! London's tSpsy turvy town
They dim the lights when night
comes down, I
The'theaters but two nights play
And give a daily matinee,
And most the women that you
meet
Have all turned workmen in the
street.
The rich walk while the poor ride
out.
Ah! truly things are turned
about.
London, Nov. 24.—If you are afraid
to so home in the dark these days,
you'd better not venture out after .tea
time in London these days or rather
nights. You feel as if you had been
transported back into the medieval
or more fittingly the dark ages when
you step blinking like an owl into
the murky dimly lighted thorough­
fares.
I for one am glad that most of the
theaters give daily matinees and but
two night performances a week. It
is far from a cozy thing after the
play to be all alone in London in the
dark and on the outside of a taxi
looking in with absolutely no hope
of being on the inside looking but.
Petrol..
High.
The price of petrol is so high and
the chauffeurs are so scarce that
taxis at nightfall.-become an fleeting
and elusive as -bats awing. They
whizz by yon deaf to your shouts and
blind to your tears. ,1
Taxi drivers are now known as
"haughties" so fastidious and parti­
cular have they become aibout their
fares. If they siae you up 'and Uke
your looks even then you mustn't be
too optimistic. They may not like
your destination and refuse to, take
you after all. Indeed so near perfec­
tion do ydu have to be in appearance
and address that it is really simpler
and safer to begin walking right
away.
There are not many women driving
taxis yet but they are running ele­
vators, acting as conductors on buss­
es, cleaning streets, working in rail­
way yards, running delivery wagons
and working in munition factories.
Jt is a curious thing that in all the
manual, strenuous and more virile
work heretofore dpne.by .the man the
women now excel, but those trying
to replace the men in the finer seem­
ingly more feminine arts are of cook­
ing, tailoring and hairdressing are
but sorry substitutes for the sterner
S6X.
War, A Leveller.
As a leveller of sexes and classes
the war is doing wonders that vie
with its horrors ^for a balancing' re­
sult. Women are coming into thefr
own as independent wage earners and
the "Colonel's lady and Judy
O'Grady" are rubbing 'eltfptys. in the
hospitals and munition factories. The
rich and titled are working side by
side with the poor and lowly. The
pampered pets have given up their
motors so the poor wounded Tommies
may ride and after the theater they
too are forced often to hotfoDt it
home to thp ancestral mange since
the haughties are no respectors of
either birth or breeding.
Yes times are dark and streets are
dark in London, but there are bright
spots. For though its Zepps that
make London dark, London makes
light of Zepps. Sometimes they make
them alight and sometimes they make
a light of them. When word arrives
that Zepps are on the way there is
some zest and thrill in staying up all
night and upon a roof to glimpse a
huge flaming mass, pointed out by the
silver Angers of the searchlights, that
falls from the sky like a Gargantuan
skyrocket set off by an intrepid young
British airman.
Airships Biasing.
Hut bringing airships blazing out
of the clouds and women filling
bombs instead of nursing bottles and
pedestrians blundering around like
moles in the Stygian streets are but
commonplace.
When it comes to turning all the
clocks up an hour for summer and
now back again an hour for the win­
ter season then it does seem going
a bit too far. It's so really unsettir
for one's social engagements don't
you know, and for the life of her.
Lady Diana can't remember whether
her date with Lord Percy is at five
o'clock winter time or summer time.
Verily tempting Fate is as nothing
to juggling Time.
The two men whom it took to per­
sonally adjust Big Ben's hands across
his startled face undoubtedly telt the
truth of this original aphorism, the
like of which I always have on tap on
time.

BITTERNESS IN GERMANY
Christiania. Norway, Nov. 24.—Nor­

the "War Insurance association" for
$25,000,000 sailing ships aggregating
50,000 tons, and insured" for $1,888,000,
and many sailing craft loaded with
lumber and pit props for England,
which were not insured. One hun­

have been taken by belligerents and

Submarine Warfare.
Germany, after a few months' rest(
suddenly started a submarine warfare
against Norwegian ships last Septe-m
ber much sharper and more merciless
than ever before—exposing the lives
of many sailors to the dangers of the
Arctic stors. At the same time, it
is declared, a hostile campaign
against Norway was launched in the
German press, all of which the Nor­

Chicago, Nov. 24.—America wastes

economic waste results from denying
justice and a legal status to such ba­

St. Joseph, Mai'Nov. 24.—"The woman in the case"—the woman
thrust into the McQaniel case by the charges of McDaniel's prosecutors
asserts she is entirely innocent just
as McDaniel himself, the prosecuting
attorney on trial for the murder of
his wife, maintains his guiltlessness
and denies .that Mrs. McDaniel ever
threatened divorce proceedings.
The woman is Mrs. Dagmar Kruck

clerk, herself a statuesque, handsome
woman, well dressed, and the mother
of a 13-year-old girl in school.
At her father's home Mrs. Krucker

My life speaks for itself.
"There are no hidden chapters in

Baltimore, Md., Nov. 24.—The Am­
erican Federation of Labor used the
Adanison Eight-Hour bill as the foot­
ball to arouse a storm of discussion
on the floor of the convention today.
Socialist members of the body led the
arguments demanding an eight-hour
day and better working conditions, al­
though they uniformly insisted that
it come through labor organization
channels ratehr than legislation.
The contended that to delegate
these issues to congress and state leg­
islatures will destroy the efficiency
of the unions and permit the entrance
of the seeds of dissolution of the Am­

the sake of the country."
Dr.'Lucy Waite spoke of the need
of legislation and said the bill to be
presented to the legislature does not
contain the word "illegitimate." "The
bill," she said, "provides that a child­
birth constitutes a marriage unless
one of the parties is already married.
Really, there is no such thin.? a$ an
illegitimate child. There may be ille­
gitimate parents, but every child that
comes into the world has legal rights.
Here in Illinois we have the worst
law in the world. It provides that a
man can settle with the mother of his
yinfant by paying her $550 within ten
years after its birth."

fhe pretty little mangling girl in

impetus to the elopement, returned to

story to the attorney.
Asked Her to Take Vacation.
"Ho just asked me to take a vaca­
tion to Jamestown and not to tell mo­
ther," was the prefacing statement,
to the girl's story. "Yes, we had
planned it for a week and another boy
and girl were to go with us. 1 knew
he was married and had a wife and
two children, but he always told me
he didn't live witb her and that lie
was going to get! a divorce."
She Gets Rooms in Hotel.
The young girl, who told the states
attorney that shfe would be 16 years
old on February 4. 1917, said she left
here with Marquette on No. 2 of Sat­
urday evening, that they arrived in
Jamestown about 10:45 o'clock that
evening, -went to a dairy lunch and
then to a hotel "on the left slde~of

watch and ring. She declared that
she "found the ring." hut when told
to tell the truth, admitted that he
had given it to her about two or three
weeks ago, and the bracelet watch,
last Saturday before leaving for
Jamestown.
Questioned sternly and closely on
her actions in Jamestown since last
Saturday night, the girl was emphatic
that there was no intimacy between
the two. She said he was going to
take work on the sewer there and
that, she had been promised a job to
begin w5rk today, but both decided
to return "to Bismarck after Mar
quete had talked with his mother over
the telephone last Wednesday.
Didn't Know Warrant Was Out.
"Did you know that a warrant was
out for the arrest of Marquette?" ask­
ed the states attorney, to which the
girl answered in the negative, stating
that they had inquired for a Bismarck
paper, but could not get one.
"I didn't want to go home. I wanted
to stay and go to work." said the girl,
'"and I didn't know we were wanted
until told so at Marquette's liome."
She told the attorney that she "was
afraid" to go to her home after ar­
riving in Bismarck and that Mar­
quette had telephoned to some place
(the name of which she did not re­

board and room.
