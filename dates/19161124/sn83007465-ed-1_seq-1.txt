EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA
. OIESAT CASTLE
86 AT TIME OF HIS DEATH
Old Francis Joseph Yields to
Death's Chill Hand?Charles
Francis Will Follow Him.
London, Nov. 22.?Emperor Francis
Joseph died last night at 9 o'clock
at Schoebrunn castle, according to a
Reuter dispatch from Vienna, by way
of Amsterdam.
Archduke Charles Fxancis, grandnephew
of Elm per or Francis Joseph,
became heir to the throne of AustriaHungary
by the assassination of
Archduke Francis Ferdinand prior to
the outbreak of the war. lie has been
in command' of the Austrian armies
on various fronts during the past two
years.
Archduke Charles Francis was born
on August 17, 1887. IJis wife was
Princess Zita of the Ilourbon house
of Parma. His father was the Archduke
Otto, who was the younger
brother of Francis Ferdinand.
Reports of Illness.
London, Nov. 21.?The first intimation
received here that Emperor
Francis Joseph's health was again
the subject of solicitation was contained
in a dispatch dated November
12, emanating from the Vienna news
agency, which reports that the emperor
had been suffering some days
from a slight catarrhal affection.
Subsequently reports from various
sources, more or less conflicting, represented
that his condition was becoming
worse but none of them indicated
that his illness threatened to
reach a critical state gnd from
Vienna ca-tno assurances that he still
was able to give audience to one or
more ministers daily.
A. What, gave some credence to the
iuspicion that his condition was
much graver than the ofllcial bulletin
indicated was the report, which still
lacks Offlcthl" rmrflrmnt+cm. -that it
had been decided to associate the
heir to the throne Archduke Charles
Francis, in the government of the
country and that he was to assume
the position on December 2 on the
68 anniversary of the emporeror's ascension
to the throne.
So far as is known here Archduke
Charles Francis still is at the front
in command of the army.
Climax to Tragedies.
With Francis Joseph's death in the
midst of this great contlict there is a
remarkable climax to a long list of
tragedies in the Hapsburg family?a
list unparalled in any other reigning
house in Europe?including the assassination
or violent death of seven
near relatives.
The fortitude with which the emperor
bore each blow and in later
years withstood the inroads of ill
health himself was the wonder of his
people. Fears that the shock of the
assassination of his heir, the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, and his consort
while on a state visit "to Bosnia
on June 2 8, 1914, would kill the emperor
were answered in characters
tic manner'.
Francis Joseph, then nearing hi*
84th birthday, recuperating at Iscbi
from a catarrhal affliction which
each spring had borne heavily upot>
him. mustered strength to return to
Vienna immediately and take a firm
grip on the confused state of affairs.
With the royal funeral rites observed
and the new heir, the young
Archduke Carl Francis Joseph, recognized,
(he venerable emperor and
his advisers turned to Servla with
demands which startled all Europe.
From the ultimatum of July 23, denouncing
t l*e anti-Austrian propaganda
and demanding prompt punishment
of the assassins of Archduke
Ferdinand, according to items supposedly
dictated by Francis Joseph
himself, practically dates the war
now ravaging Europe.
At 19 j(^nr8 aKp hp ascended the
throne of Austria, upon abdication of
his uncle, Ferdinand I, December 2.
1848. His death today ended an active
reign of 68 years, all but the
first 20 years of which he was also
apostolic king of Hungary.
Tradition says that i'haraoh ruled
for 09 years and there is the more
credible instance of Uameses II
L (Seostris of the Greeks) whose reign
iftf la reputed to have covered 67 years.

Present Fair Surpas
Ex
Lancaster county is indeed fortuJnate
in the interest manifested by its
ipeople in their fair and the great
event this year is the biggest and
best we have ever had. Fortune has
favored the 1!?16 fair and everybody
iia in .holiday mood. The opening
.days of the fair were spent in visiting
I the exhibits, which are well worth
a careful study. Time and space
I forbid more than a mere mention of
'the general features of these exhibits,
lall of which are most creditable.
| neginning at the court house, in
I which are to be found the houseI

well as other interesting exhibits, we
will take up in order the things to be
seen in that building. A beautiful
community exhibit is to be found at
the right of the entrance, the Pleasant
Valley booth in charge of Mrs. M.
C. Culp, Mrs. P. P. Stevenson and
Mrs. O. W. Potts. This booth represents
the work of the community

members and a chart records the
total of their summer work in canning
fruits and vegetables. 4,32 7
besides 62 9 glasses of jelly, as well as
the Girl's Sewing Club. Attractive
specimens of canning are to be
seen and also elaborate articles in
tatting, crochet and hand embroidery.
A lovely basket of homegrown
apples and lemons, bread
'made from home-grown wheat,
j mammoth yellow chrysanthemums,
!etc., make this booth very ' epresentative
of home and garden. A

passerby, young and old.
Likewise interesting is the Van

Hyatt, who brought the com'lU

arranged them most artistically.
I Pantry products, prepared by the
I Home Demonstration Club, hand emIbroidery,

lIUKh Ilarrelson Meets Death at
< 'ommissnry.
Dillon, Nov. 111.?Hugh Ilarrelson,
a prominent planter of this county,
i was killed late this evening while
jserving a number of negroes at his
commissary. Mrs. Ilarrelson. who
iwas in the home at the time of the
killing, was severely beaten by a negro
who was sent to the house to
prevent her from giving the alarm.
She will recover. A considerable
inumber of Dillon people, as well as
some other sections of the county,
(have gone to the scene. If the pursuers
capture any negroes against
whom there seems to be proof a
lynching is feared.
Yesterday Mr. Ilarrelson had tro\ij'ble
with a drunken negro, who stood

iturning from Dillon and dared him
| to nass. Mr. Harrelson threatened
him with the law. Today, however,
'the negro came to Mr. Harrelson
(and apologized, the matter apparently
being cleared up.
Date this evening while Mr. Har'relson
was waiting on several negroes.
| who had come to his commissary
|near Pleasant Hill church, seven
! miles front Dillon, he was attacked
and beaten to death with some blunt
instrument. The motive was apparently
robbery. The slayers went
through his clothes and took all the
money he had with him. Mrs. Harrelson
explained that her husband
was known to carry from $30 to $40
in his pocket all the time, and it was
probably for this that the negroes
killed him.
Mrs. Harrelson, who was in the
house alone, was beset by a negro,
whom she recognized. His mission
! evidently was to prevent her from
(giving an alarm. He struck her over
the head with a club and she fleo,
,taking refuge under a table. Shortly

TI1K ATHLKT1C SHOW. 1>
Champion Hover and Wrestlers at the I
Lee County Fair.
During the summer months it is 1
customary for boxers and wrestlers j
to abandon the ring and mat and to c
seek out a favorable resort for a long 1
rest, and to enjoy life through the.t
hot season. The result often times s
is more or less dissipation on the i
part of the athletes, and when they e
again enter the ring they find them- 1
selves out of condition. Kid Mender- c
son, the manager of the Athletic s
Show with the Great American t
Shows, has solved the problem for f
hiR clever athletes. Instead of a'
popular resort he chooses a traveling o
organization, and has thereby kept f
them in the pink of condition and I
given them vacation at the same ->
time. They are all clever ring artists, 1
and are pleasing hundreds of people t
highly where the Grent American s
Shows go. Young Herman, who is p
well known from coast to coast, will v
meet all coiners at the hair, in fact
the management issues a sweeping,
challenge to any local boxer or
'wrestler who would care to meet any
' of the whirlwinds with the show.
They are always In condition, and
always ready. r
Mose Marshall is the proud pes
sessor of a number of medals, and is <
|always anxious to meet the local M
atletes wherever he goes. K
i Mr. Henderson himself is always ?
on hand to give some clever exhi- R
bitlons, and the Athletic Show never
has a dull minute.
