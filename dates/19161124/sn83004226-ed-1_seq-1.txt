DEDICATION OF MASONIC
HALL 50 YEARS ACO
INTERESTING
BIT OF LOUISA
HfSTORY RECALLED BY
ANNIVERSARY.
, November 20, 1916, is a memorable
date In the history of local, Preemus -
onry, it being tne ootn anniversary or
the dedication of the Masonic Hall In
Louisa. Much preparation had been
made In anticipation of the day, and!
Louisa people then and now proverbial
for their hospitality, had spread them
selveH to do honor to the event. Fat
', ted calves, pigs, turkeys and chickens
had been killed and prepared with
skill no less pronounced than that dls-
played by their successors and descend
ants of the present day.
A very large crowd was anticipated
and all expectations In this regard were
fully met. Delegations from every Ma
sonic Lodge In this end of tho State
and adjacenl Weat Virginia were pres
ent, coming In all manner of ways and
all kinds of transportation. On the af
ternoon of the preceding day the fa
mous Rover, commanded by Capt.
Henry Hager and ploletcd by his now
distinguished son John F. Hager, of
Ashland, brought a crowd which pack
ed the boat to Its utmost capacity.
Among the Freemasons In attendance
were some of the most distinguished
craftsmen In the State..
About nine o'clock on the morning
of the 20th Apperson Lodge was open
ed for the last time. That place was
in the second story of the old court
house. The officers of that last meet
ing were as follows:
John W. Jones, W. W.; B. A. Stub
bins, S. W.; F. R. Moore. J. W.: G. R.
B. Chapman, Treaa.; G. F. Johnson,,
Sec.; C. 8. Chapman, 8. D.; J. D. Ren
hart, J. D.i Thos. D. Marcum, S. St T.
One glance at these names will show
he average Loutstan that few of these
olllcers are now living. A procession
was formed which marched through
Louisa to the new hall, which was
crowded to Its utmost capacity. Rev.
J. F. Medley had been appointed Dep
uty Grand Master of the Grand Lodge
of Kentucky and he in his most Im
presslve way, assisted by his brother
officers, dedicated Apperson Lodge, No.
195, In ample form.
Previous to the dedication subscrlp
tlons for a payment of the debt then
remaining were asked for with most
succeesful results. This "ceremony"
too, was conducted by Brother Medley,
who beside being a past master In Ma
sonry was a "past master" In ralslsg
money for lodges and churches. A
great many of: the visitors remained
over night, enjoying the hospitality of
our citizens. As Is well known the
first floor of the Masonic Hall was for
many years used as a school room. A
day or two after the dedication Dr. G.
W. Wroten, of this city, was made
principal of what was then Masonic
Academy, which position he held for
six consecutive years. At the close of
that period he resumed the practice of
medicine.
We are Indebted to Dr. Wroten for
this bit of ancient history, and It Is given
here In the belief that It will Interest
hundreds of readers of the NEWS,
many of whom were living at the time
if this dedication and others are de
scendants of those who took part In
the affair.
It may be of Interest to some to hear
that It had been the Intention of the
surviving pupils of the Academy to
hold a reunion, but the continued 111
health of Its old principal has prevent
ed consummation of this Intention.
MRS. ELIZABETH YOUNG.
In memory of my dear grandmother,
Mrs. Elizabeth Young, who died Nov.
18, 1916, aged d2 years. She was laid
to rest In the family graveyard and her
funeral was preached at the old home
place, Also, that of M. B. Young's buby
lessle Jones, who died some time ago.
Servtcea were conduoted by Rev. E. D.
Parker, M. V. Berry and A. L. Hicks.
She leaves three sons and three daugh

erected a standpine for fire protectibn
and equipped the volunteer department'
of which Walters was chief. One hot
dry summer day Walters conceived the
idea of relieving the situation by
sprinkling the main street. Incidental

As Walters was employed by the com

street Leslie made the company a par
ty; but the court said sprinkling the
street was no part of Walters' duties,
