OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY
VOL. LVm.NO.14
'•Sfezi'A&i
HERE THEY
A E!
One of the young ladies whose name is list below will represent and enact
prominent part in "The Wild Rose of Iowa," a five reel motion picture tbat
3a to tell the story of Iowa to America's millions. For the girl thus selected
there will come distinction and honor. If she should be so fortunate as to be
•d to enact the title role "The Wild Rose of Iowa," it would mean fame
•|and fortune. She would be universally regarded as the Iowa feminine proto
type—she would be "Miss Iowa."
What would you not give—what would any girl not give to win the rare
distinction of representing her city and her state in a capacity at once so worthy,
so dignified and so alluring as to challenge the highest and most exalted gifts
tt nature and culture?
Here becomes apparent the obligation of every worthy citizen—an obliga
tion born of civic pride—to take part in the naming the fortunate young lady
to whom this distinction is to be given. Ballots, your votes are to decide the
iwie. Votes are issued with admission tickets at the Opera House. The bal
lot box is locked and the keys are deposited at the Opera House. The election
•'^--"jopena Dec. 6th and closes Jan. 10th at noon. Three prominent citizens will be
®v|*riected as judges in the final count. No standings are made public until the
l^doae of the election and then only of the winner, to avoid embarrassment to
others. Tke public is advised that this election should in no sense be cori
|f£ jsfased with an ordinary contest, which dangles a sordid dollar at its goal. The
"State Historical Film Corporation is primarily engaged in producing pLoto
plays, not conducting contests. You ara always assurred of an excellent pro
jv- Cram at the Opera House.

Rahl Rah! for Wilson.
San Diego, Cal., Nov. 13, 1916.
Dear Plain Dealer:
Can't you see why I did not stay to
vote for Wilson—knew California was
calling me. Got here in time to atump
the state for Wilsm Close work, but
right will prevail. Made up my mind
some time ago when tbat Bewhiskered
Gentleman starting out with his speech
es did nothing but criticise and con
demn every act of Pres. Wilson, he
was cooking his Goose. My feelings
were same as when Cleveland was
elected and I put up accordingly, only
a little more so. The old G. O. P. is
sure dying hard. The Old Elephant
here since the election has groaned and
moaned sighed and cried and finally
toppled over and died. Tne pall bear
ers here are many but he is at last con*
signed to the lonely tomb where I
think he will remain for several cam
paigns to come.
Call it coincidence or what you like,
but when we bad filled the program at
the Smoke House, I played a game of
Smear with a dear friend, I for Wilson
he for Hugnes, and I won. The night
of election here, we were invited to a
fine chicken dinner at the home of Geo.
Tillson. A .fine young man who sat
next to me got the wishbone. I told
him I would like him to pull for Hughes
and had Miss Stella pull for Wilson for
me and we won again.
The Tillsons are located in what I
call the best part of the city in a fine
home. The two daughters are lovely
girls and are sure full of business. We
are located near them in the home of a
lovely female widow.
Have put in one day at the Expo
sition and don't think we looked over
one hundreih'part of it. The Canada
exhibit was the grandest I ever saw in
my life and with the trip here to see:
Was surprised to find the weather so
different from Florida. There all one
needed to wear was a fig leaf and straw
hat, here overcoat and furs, but the
air from mountain and ocean is fine.
We stopped off at Williams and went
out 70 miles to Grand Canyon and look
ed over in the' afternoon the grandest
sight I ever saw and planned some
trips for the next dpy, but the next
mring it was coot astf blowing a gale
so took the trip for' hefo. Shall re*
main a'month longer or more and then
to Los Angeles and to many other
(daces of interest. Expect to take a

trip to Honolula some time during the
winter and if not intruding may write
you of the sweet Honey Lu Lu girls.
Must add that George, Cora, John and
Hattie are making our stay here very
pleasant and hope the climate will be
such that we will remain here for a
long time. John Brown is getting fat
enough to kill and when you see them
taking in provisions you don't wonder
at the high cost of living. Saw Thos.
Gaskill and wife yesterday—bad just

Faraers' Institute.
Farmer's Institute meeting Dec. 16,
1916, at one p. m. Court House hall
called by the President, John F. Mur
tha for the purpose of determining the
needs of the forthcoming institute to
be held amid winter and acch other
matters as may properly come before
it.
The busy season will soon be over,
the time for diversion lengthens and
Thanksgiving time is at hand. To no
one does these times of opportunities
mean more than to the former. He is
of the most numerous class of these
fayored by the conditions which creat
ed the present high eost of living. He
is especially so favored in this locality
in the bounteousness of the harvests,
and last but not least in the prevalent
general good health of people and do
mestic animals.
Considering these things which in
part have come to pass through efforts
of preparedness, we therefore in fur
therance of and to the end that a great
er preparedness may grow upon us, in
vite and desire the attendance of all
who feel inclined to do something tow
ard making the next farmer's institute
all that it should be as a Mecca of at
traction. Some of the questions to be
considered are: Will the entire session
be held at Cresco? Or will it be ap
portioned to Lime Springs and Ches
ter?
Is it desired to have farm and other
exhibits?
The foregoing question is suggestive
of fair grounds, buildings to grow and
an agricultural society. Reader, if you
are interested, think it over of your
own free will and speak out at the
meeting.
Will tbe boys and girls, school teach
ers and church ministers render their
valuable assistance?
In the matter of expense, no remun
eration direct or indirect goes to any of
the officers, save incidentals such as
postage for secretary.
The state appropriation of $75 does
not extend out very far in securing
outside ability and less when divided,
consequently much will depend on our
home capacity to supply tbe talent nec
essary to a complete and entertaining
program.
Satnrday for the teachers and boys
and girls, Lime Springs and Cbester to
hear from, the meeting to get your
ideas if you can't come send them.

ter Mamie, and Katie Falada, cousin of
the bride, while Joseph|£Huber and.-./ Jy^
Louis Kalishek acted as best men* -8
Dorothy Birmingham," tbe bride'a v"
cousin, was the flower girl.
The bride was charmingly attired in
a gown of white silk crepe de chene
trimmed with lace and pearls'and wore
a veil crowned with a wreath of white
roses and carried a bouquet* of white
chrysanthemums. The bridesmaid*
wore dresses of cream color china sillM
After the ceremony an elaborate din*
ner was served at the .home of the
bride's parents to about one hundred
and seventy guests. The dining room
was beautifully decorated in a color
scheme of green and white.
The young couple will "reside on the
groom's farm east of Protivin wher^
the best wishes of their many friends
accompany them. A Friend,
Mr. McKitrich will talk on rural
problems in economics. Rural teach
ers may feel that this is a high school
subject, but it is not, Mr. McKitrich
will take up questions that every rural
teacher should know, questions that are
vital to rural life. Patrons and school
officers should find something of inter
est in this work and are invited to at
tend.
Miss Atchison gives a type lesson in
geography, one that should be helpful
to teachers in every grade of world
Those who heard Miss Atchison last
year will remember her splendid work,
and be glad to have her return,

representing the same nurseries.
