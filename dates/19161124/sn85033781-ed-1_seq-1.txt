SHERIFF BEATTIE
GAINS NOTORIETY
Gets a column story in the
Chicago Daily News
This Week
TOOK FORGER WANTED IN CITY
Xook Prisoner te Chicago
and Cheated Sleuths
Out of Trip
Seldom does a sheriff of the so-
-ailed rural communities break into
print with a column story in the met- ,
ropolitan dailies. Such was the honor I
wever, accorded Shenfl Beattie.
Following is the story which ap
peared in the Chicago Daily Tribune
?f last Monday:
"Van Huron county, Michigan, has
a "sherilf who is right up to snuff.
His name is Gladstone Beattie. The
Chicago police wanted Michael Novak
of 1905 South Kedzie Avenue, for
'putting over a bum check." He was
opposed to be on a farm somewhere
in Van Buren county. That was the
only information Dectectives Howe
and McSwiggin of the bureau could
fire Sheriff Beattie.
At 11 o'clock yesterday morning the
sheriff drove up in his automobile to
mmwm fiinn nur Covert. It
was a thirty-three mile drive from
Paw Paw, the county seat of Van
Buren. Sheriff Beattie threw robe
over the engine and walked toward ;
the farm house that stood back quite

response to his knock at the front
door. He went around to the rear
ind knocked again.
"Hullo!" he shouted. "Ain't there
nobody home?"
There was no reply.
"Maybe they're out in the barn,"
Mid the sheriff to himself M he
walked in the direction oi mat nuuu-
mg. A horse and a cow were the
only occupants.
The sheriff stood behind the barn
scratching his head. He looked afar
off and saw a man and woman husk
ing corn in a field. He cut across and
was soon up to them.
"How de do,", spoke the sheriff.
Want to hire a good corn husker?"
The man and woman laughed. Tak
ing the husking peg from the man's
hand, the sheriff grabbed up an ear
of corn and said :
"Let me show you how."

I H1IH Y-FIGHT CENTS FOR EGGS
Katon and Mosier's "ad" this week
states that they pay thirty-six cents
per dozen cash or trade for eggs.
The price was alright when the copy
was written, but prices raise USSM
flays in the twinkling of an eye, and
the price at this store as we go to
press is thirty-eight cents per dozen
.cash or trade.

A Proclamation
"No M an Liveth to Himstlf Alone. This declaration is so
simple that a child can understand it. The whole world frequently
contributes to the ingredients ol a simple morning mea I. The every
day comforts of life are the contributions of many minds and many
hands. Literature, science, art, schools, colleges and churches are the
gifts of the people. Our own United States, the greatest and noblest
nation on the earth, is of the people, as proclaimed in that matchless
document, the Declaration of Independence. The charter of human
rights recognizes the divine in the human. If it were adopted by the
nations of the earth, it would bring abiding world-peace, prosperity
and happiness. God has given man the earth and its manifold riches.
Th is year, of all the years of th is great Republic, is a fitting time
for thanksgiving. No nation Iiveth to itself alone. May we on
Thanksgiving Day remember in our prayers and acts, the millions of
widows and orphans, the millions of maimed and dying, the millions
of prisoners of war in other lands. They are our kindred. May
America become a beacon light of liberty to all the world.
Therefore, I, Woodbridge N. Ferris, Governor of the State of
Michigan, do hereby join the President of the United States in des
ignating Th ursday. the thirtieth of November, as a day for all the
people of this Gommonwea Ith to celebrate in tnanksgl ving and prayer.

Big Job Offered Warden Simpson
Best Warden Michigan Ever Had May Become Business
Manager of Order of Gleaners.
Some weeks ago, Warden N. F.
Simpson confided to the writer, while
on a visit to Paw Paw friends, that
he had been tendered the business
management of the Order of Glean
ed at a tempt mgsalary. He was un
decided at that time as to his future
plans, and we were not at liberty to
make the matter public. The Hart-
o v. i
ford Day Spring, however, run the
following story in its last issue, from
which it would seem that the Warden
is seriously considering the prop
osition: "That Nathan P. Simpson of Hart
ford, present warden of Jackson state
prison, may become the business man
ager of the Order of Gleaners, is a
possibility that has become known to
the Warden's Hartford friends.

Warden admitted that the position

MERITED BOOST FOR
! O'GRADY BROTHERS
One of the busy places in Paw Paw
these days is the O'Grady Bros, big
tete on the corner. Both of the DO)
' are hustlers, and are building up a
business that will eclipse the busy j
i days of the "Long I J rick" in its palmy
I days of years gone by, when it was
the Hub of the clothing business for i
all the county. This store is not only
appreciated by the home people who I
' know both the O'Grady boys, but at- I
j tracts the attention of strangers as
, well. Following is a paragraph elip ,
j ped from The Michigan Tradesman of
last week and If from the pen of E. R.
Haight, a travelling salesman.
"One of the most attractive display
windows we have seen in many a day
is the one just completed by O'Grady
Brothers (Ed and Jim) of Paw Paw.
These boys handle all the high grade
haberdashery on the market and have
a city store in a country town."
IS MUSTERED OUT
Aver ill J. Roundy Passed

Lingering Illness.
Averill J. Roundy was born n Wood
stock, Windsor county, Vermont,
March 11th, 18.'i.". He pas.sed away
at his home in Paw Paw, November
21st, 1916; aged eighty-one years,
eight months and ten days. While
yet a small boy his parents came to
Michigan. For many years he has
resided in Paw Paw. On September
30th, 186f he was united in marriage
to Miss Ellen S. Southwell. Their
home was blessed by the birth of four
children, Harry who died in Los An
geles, California, July 20th, of this
year; Frank of Calexico, California;
Mrs. F. J. Wildey of Long Beach, Cal-
ifornia; and C. F. Roundy of Paw Paw

Mr. Roundy enlisted April 21st,
181 for a term of three years, in
Company C. which was formed in Paw
Paw and sent to fill the Seventieth

MARKETING ASS'N
As Organized in Berrien Co.
Articles of Incorporation
Have Been Filed.
WILL INCREASE EFFICIENCY
Co-operation of All Associ
ations Is the Ultimate
Result Desired.
Our neighboring county of Berrien
Is f ast being converted to the idea of
co-operation and organization in the
handling of fruit. Three Fruit Asso
ciations have been formed in that
county within the last six months.
The latest to be organized is the Ber
rien County Fruit Association with iU
main ofh'ce at Coloma. Articles of in
corporated have been tiled with the
secretary of state. The association
is without capital stock, and is a non
profit corporation. The membership
fee is one hundred dollars, and the
money derived from the memberships
will be used in the establishment of
a central packing house and providing
equipment for the same. The object
of the association will be to more
efficiently market the fruit products
of its members. Instead of dividends
on shares of stock, the members will
receive a larger share of the consum
er's dollar. This is the third fruit
association formed in Berrien county
within six months.
As soon as standard associations
are scattered throughout the Fruit
Belt of Michigan an effort will be
made to combine the associations into
a strong federation which will outline
a single definite policy for all the
locals belonging to the federation. In
this way, it is believed, that the fruits
will be much more efficiently marketed
than is now the case. At the present
time there is a great waste, because
of the competition between rival
associations. The new policy will
call for co-operation among farmers
so that they will not compete one with
another, and co-operation between
associations for the same reason.
