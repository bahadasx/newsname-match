testimony there may probably be onS
or two more witnesses put on the stand
before the defendant rests his ctu»e.
In reply to the usual customary

stated he had lived In Kansas City for
four years and was now employed by
the W. J. Burns International 'Detec
tive-Agency, located in that city. He
has been with the Burns people since

bad never been in Vlllisca and enterr
talned no thought in his mlnft as to
who the party guilty «C~the ax murder

counsel he said he had never taiet Sen
ator Jones, W. B. McOaull. Mansfield
.. or Harry Whipple prior to beginning
JjljlS VUliSflar investigations.
i-a
Had No Malice.
Vi-jn reply to his counsel's question
wKether or not he had ever made any
statements of his Investigations thru
^malice Wilkerson replied, "I had mal
ic* toward no living soul".
(Mr. Mitchell first called upon his
client to relate the conversation he
had wlth sknator Arney in the Pilgrim
Hotel. Marshalltown. Senator Arney
was qr witness for the plaintiff and tea
tided,that In that conversation Wilker
son Vtn substance had .told him h^ had

the Moore murder. Wilkerson said
l-that on this occasion he hac^eaten din
ner opposite Senator Arney and that in
reply to questions he had told'the sen
ator he was the man that arrested
"BllT*^ -Mansfield for the Moore murder.
"WllkersQn sal4 that in reply to a query
from Senator Arney as to how he ex
pected td connect the name of Senator
Jones wi^i the murder he had, declined
to ^discuss the case with the Marshall
town man.

tion with the murder in his Charlton
conversation.
'Admits Implicating Jonas.
Wilkerson also denied having made
any characterisation of Senator Jones
to Joe Aldrich on the train between
Vlllisca and ^Creston, as had 'been
brought out by the plaintiff's case in
ohief. He did say at that time, he tes
tified.' that as far as hia investigations
showed, Senator Jones was at the bot
tom of It.
The detective then went into a re
cital of what he said were the sources
of his information in conducting his
investigations, much of which lias been
testified to by. witnesses the defense
has put on the stand. Wilkerson said
he relied on this information as being
the truth. Jjje was just going into the
story he claimed Vina Tompkins had

against the wall in the room in the Joo
Moore home where the two little Still
inger girls "were discovered with their
heads crushed on the morning of June
10, 1912, was exhibited publicly for the
first time when it was offered in evi
dence on behalf of the defense by
8herlff O. E. Jackson, of Montgomery
county.
Sheriff Jackson on direct examina
tion was called upon to tell what Mrs.
Vina Tompkins had fold in his pres
ence tn the Pilgrim Hotel at Marshall
town when she was shown a picture of
Senator Jones. The sheriff testified
that Mrs. Tompkins, at. that time in
the presence of Wilkerson and, himself,
had said tft&t the ploture was a like
ness of the man "with the Whiskers"
at the alleged plot held on the middle
Nodaway river. Sheriff Jackson also
.said that he was present when P. H.
Thorp, of Jefferson, identified" William
Mansfield in "the county Jail here as the
man who had ridden on the train with
him from darinda to New Market, the
morning the Snurder was discovered.
M*. Jackson said he told Wilkerson of
this. Sheriff Jackson further declared
that Wilkerson was present when
Thorp picked out a ploture as being
ne of Harry Whipple, who was with
dansfieldl that morning.
On cross examination Mr. Jackson
declared he did not know who put the
writing on the back of the picture of
Sena/or Jones, shown to Vina Tomp
kins, and didn't know whther Mrs.
Tompkins' signature had been put
there before' 0* after the written state
®®^t. Mrs. WUlard, he. said, saw
Mansfield when he was In the jail here
but made no identification of him In
his presence, it was also brought out
on cross exiamination that the conver
sation in the Pilgrim Hotel between
WUkerson. Sheriff Jackson and Mrs.
Tompkins was recorded by means of a
dictaphone. Jackson ,sald that prior

1912 and that four yjMu-s later Thorp
had recognized him in the court room
here when the grand -Jury was In ses
sion. This latter fact, which th^ de
fendant offered as a test of Thorp's
memory, was stricken from the records
on objection from Jones' counsel.

taker in Vlllisca in 1912 and assisted
in the preparation of the axman's vic
tims for burial, was called to the wit

Bulgarians, which may prove of
notable Importance. Bucharest re
ports an attempt by hostile forces
to oross the Danube at Zimnitsa,
vthirty-flve miles southwest of
Glurglu, on the railroad leading to
Bucharest. This move, if suc
ceesful, would mean a. cutting in

Germany Pians to
Call Into Service
Men Up to 60 Years
London, Nov, 4,—The German auxil
iary service bill la considered by Sec
retary of the Interior von Loebel as
surpassing in* importance all previous
war measurHMS according to an Am
sterdani'dispatoh to Rcuter's describing
the debate on the bill before the main
committee of the reichstag.
Secretary Von Loebel opened the de
bate on the im which provides for the
services of ?]1 fnen from 17 to 60. He
said that besides the millions whom it
wouldvrendek* liable to service in the
army It would affect 3,000,000 to, be
called upon for other services in this
war, which "is not only a war of armies
but a war of political economy, a war
of nations."
Explaining that the object of the bill
was the mobilization of labor, the
minister declared that instead of the
lack of employment which prevailed
at the beglnnlng of the war there was
now a positive lack of labor, especially
in the manufacture^of munitions and
war material of all kinds. He said the
bill is intended to assure the susten
ance of the laboring population and
that compulsion would only be used as
a last resort'and was not needed for
women.

NEW RUSSIAN PREMIER.
Alexander Prepoff Named Beeauaa of
Political Conditions.
London, Nov. 24.—Alexander Prepoff,
Russian minister of railways, has been
appointed premier, according to a Reu
ter dispatch from Petrograd. The Re
tiring premier, M. Sturmer, by an im
perial ukase, has been appointed grand
chamberlain -of the imperial court, re
taining his fiinctlonB as a member of
the council_of the empire.
Petrograd newspapers say that the
appointment of M. Prepoff as premier
implies the necessity that the govern
ment make a communication to parlia
ment explaining the impending prob
lems of government.
[The retirement of Premier Sturmer
and the appointment of M. Trepoff as
his successor probably are outgrowths
of what has been referred to in a
few carefully censored Petrograd dis
patches recently as a "serious political
crisis." The change apparently im
plies a victory for the liberal elements
of /Russia over the bureaucratic regime,
for M. Stunner always has been prom
inent In the, affairs of the Russian
bureaucracy* while M. Trepoff In the
patt has engaged in a variety of re
form work.
A reoent Petrograd dispatch quoted
Paul MUoukoff, one of the prominent
liberal leaders^ as saying an agree
inen&f JSattt&een reached between the
gov«MpK and 'the dusfia. which was

Career as Maohinist in Plymouth
Mass.
London, Nov. 24.—Sir Hiram Maxim,
Inventor^ of the automatic system of
firearms, died at his home here early
this morning.
Sir Hiram Maxim was born in
S&ngerville, Maine, on Feb. 5, 1840.
He was a desoendent of English Puri
tans among the early settlers in
Plymouth, Mass. After a meager
schooling he went to work in a ma
chine shop. At 28 he was draftsman in
a large steamship building concern in
New York City, where he invented a
lccomotive headlight which went Into
use. He did much to perfect gas ma
chines for lighting private houses. In
1S77 he took up electricity and was
among the first to make electric lamps
in the United States. He took out
many patents on electrical machinery.
In 1881 he was made a chevalier of
the Legion of Honor of France, by
President Grevy.
Becomes British Subject.
The Maxim automatic gun was in
vented in 1884 in London and was im
mediately adopted by the British gov
ernment, which used it in the war of
England with the Matabeles in South
Africa. The gun fired 600 rounds a
minute and caused such slaughter that
parliament seriously discussed the
question as to whether its use was
justified.
Some years later Sir Hiram, created
a baronet by Queen Victoria, in 1901
after beiiw naturalized as an English
man, invented the first smokeless
powder.
In 1884 Sir Hiram Maxim invented a
