FAVORS EMBARGO
ON
Chairman Fitzgerald To Launch Bill
In Ihe House
Farmers May Protest Against The
Contemplated Action
Washington, Nov. 23. Represents-'
tlvo Fitzgerald, Democrat, chairman
of the house appropriations 'Commit
tee, announced that ho favored an em
bargo on foodstuffs and that it wao
his purpose to proparo a hill and to
press the subject early the -coining
vession of congress.
"Two reasons chlelly impel me to
favor omburgo legislation on food
stuns," said JIr. Fitzgerald. "It U
tho most elfectlve weapon in our con
troversy with Great Britain over her
unwarranted, outrageous and indefen
sible blacklist of American merchants
As our foodstuffs are needed abroad
an. embargo will be more -effective
than weary months of diplomatic ne
gotiations which end in t'no continu
ance of tho indefensible .practices
against our rights.
"The embargo also should be ire
posed for purely domestio reasotifa.
The prices of foodstuffs have reached
levels that are bringing widespread
distress to tho country.
"Many hundreds of thousands of
our peonlo are suffering from the lack
of tho necessities of life. Wholesale
prices in many commodities are les;
abroad toddy than they wore a year
ago; here the retail prices ihave ad
vanced alarmingly.
"The argument that nothing should
be done to Interfere with the -expansion
of our foreign trade does not Im
press me. Of what profit Is it If our
foreign trade Is to grow -w'ith leaps
and bounds while our own people are
brought to the verge of starvation as
a result of it? The time 1b Tipo for
the embargo and I hope to boo legis
lation speedily enacted to lmposo It.
lt America bo for Americans first."
Government's Attitude.
It seems to bo gouerally agrcel
iore lhat the coming session -of con
gress will see a fight over the em
bargo proposal, which Is backed by
monster petitions signed by thousand".
of persons and organizations.

the secretary of stato after all county
certifications reach him.
Official figures show the lowest
Democratic elector to bo 1,242 ahead

moves all doubt that Wilson will gei

London, Nov. 23. In the Walla

would indicate that the perilous posl

Vienna, Nov. 23. Archduke Charle
Francis Josephs heir apparent, as
sumed the guidance of state affairs
automatically as a result of the death
of Kmpeior Francis Joseph. It is not
likely lhat festivities of any kind will
usher In his reign, certainly not dur
ing the war.
The end of Emperor Francis Josepa.
was peaceful, tho aged monarch pass
ing away as though sinking Into sleep.
Among those In the death chamber
at Sch'cenbrunn castle was the heir
apparent.
The emperor had been suffering
from a bronchial inflammation, but
pneumonia developed and suddenly
reached a critical stage. Baron Bu
rian, who, in addition to being for
eign minister. Is also minister of the
imperial and royal household, was
summoned. He left the sick chamber
a little later,vbut hardly had reached
his 'office w'hen the death' of the em
peror was announced.
Comment in the newspapers voiced;
regret that the emperbr had not been
spared inng enough to see the end ot'
the war, which, according to the ac
cepted view here, nobody regretted
more than he. as he never tired of
assuring his Intimates.
With Emperor Francis Joseph
passes the world's oldest monarch, a
man whose life was one continuous
tragedy, which ended In the greatest
tragedy of all time the present war
Francis Joseph was really beloved
by his people, "who comprised half a
score of races. They found In him the-,
cement which held together the stata
structure of Austria-Hungary.
To the very last the emperor, who.
had no conception of the value of'
money, spent prodigious sums In
charity, never overlooking any of the.
many old men and women who used
to come to Schoenbrunn palace to re
ceive alms.
The emperor had a prodigious ca
pacity for work, rising generally at 4,
o'clock in the morning and taking- up,
various reports.
In connection with the death of
Francis Joseph, attention Is belnp
called in Italy to the fast that Arch
duke Charles Francis Is married to an
Italian. She was Princess Zlta of Par
ma and was brought up In Italy.
