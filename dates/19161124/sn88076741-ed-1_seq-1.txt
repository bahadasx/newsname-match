(OFFICIAL PAPER OF OITY
VABOWBLL THOMPSON.
F- A. WarAwreU. G.G. Thompson
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
On the fcommettie British report some
slight advances, which is important only
as they prove that in that region they
are still on the ofiensive.
In southern- Serbia the Serbian armies
are still moving north in their own
country and have occupied .Monaetir.
The latter city-eats not much, figure as
a military center but as it has been a
bona of-contention during two Balkan
wars and.latter taken by the German
Austrian armies, the recapture has
something of a-moral significance. The
German-Austrian armies areretreating
northwards.
In tioumania things am -somewhat
mixed with the.proabilities *3 consider
able German-Austro succeesee. On the
north the Teutons are apparently gain
ing in tbe fight with Roumanian and
Russian forceB for the possession of the
mountain passes, which onoe. gained by
the Teutons will allow them to invade
Kou mania.
On the western border Field Marshal
Yon Volkenhayn has pressed the .Rou
manians backward and will probably
over-run all western Routaauia which is
a fine agricultural county. At the south
eastern corner of Roumania where the
Roumanians were reported last week as
having defeatedMackensen'sarmy, there
is but little news, and one war critic
ventures that the retreat of Maokensen
was purposely to draw the Roumanians
into a trap. All critics agree that the
Roumanian armies are in a very critical
position.
The death of Francis Joseph .Aus*
tria Hungary opens up new possibilities
in this war. It was often stated before
the war that when Emperor Fxancis
Joseph died that .the dual monarchy
would fall in pieced. The Austrian
-em­
pire is composed principally of at least
four nationalities of .peoples who have
but little in common, besides a very
laige number of smaller peoples, each
speaking a different language, with
many other racial distinctions. But it
is not probable that there will be anf
internal disturbances at this time be
cause war with its common dangers will
unite them at least while the danger
exists. The suoeessor to the throne is
evidently a fighter as he
is
now in com­
mand of an army in the eastern part of
tbe war zone.
The "Deutschland" after trying to
leave New London harbor and running
down one of her own tugs, and drowning
its crew of five, returned to port with
some slight damages and sailed again pn
Monday. It is claimed that the acci
dent was caused by an eddy, but from a
seaman's point of view, "somebody blun
dered."
Is the "squeezing process" beginning
to get exhausted Except on the Somme
we hear but little pressure. Russia in
Galicia which made so great a push at
first has made no progress for two or
three weeks. So with the Italians.
While in the Balkans the news from an
allied stand-point is not favorable.
There is talk of a vigorous winter
oampaign from the allies
Bide.
We won­
der what the effect of bombardment of
tvesen trenches would be? It it were
possible to deetroy them by artillery, as
seems nectssary before progress can be
made, in what kind of position would
attacking troops find themselves in pos
session of demolished trenches where
ground was frozen too solid for immedi
ate ''reorganization" as the despatches
term the repairs? It would look as
though the enemy who still held the
second-line trenches would have the
attadkers at considerable disadvantage.
THANKSGIVING.
How the years roll around. Here we
ere at the eve of another .Thanfcsgiviug
•day at the time when we annually bal
ance our bookserf profit and loss, indi
vidually, socially and nationally. To
(the few there 'may eeem to them a
balance against them, though possibly
they have forgotten to give the Giver of
all things duecredit for goods received,
possibly the :greatest and most common
of all.
Individually it is up to each person to
do his own bookkeeping, 'but socially
and nationally the books ar9 open to all.
Perhaps this year, we may be more
thankful lor what are not rather than
for what we have. Nationally
if the question were asked, for what
should we be most thankful, the answer
would oome from every citizen of this
country "That we are -not involved in
the European war.*1
Even with a bare-existence, with poor
crops and bad times .generally, even in
that case our lot would'Jbe so far in con
trast to that of tbe waning nations that
we would still be very grateful for our
own peace. But we are not only peace
ful but we are also prosperous. Per
haps to some degree that prosperity
cones'from the misfortunes of others,
but we still are prosperous. Peace .and
prosperity we have in sufficient quantity
to allow us to say-a heartfelt "Thank
you" to Him whoirules our prosperity*
But be who i& truly grateful waots to
share his good fortune, otherwise ihis
gratitude is not very deep. We who are
so thankful because we are at peace,
should not forgetthose who are deep in
the manifold miseries of war. It is their
plight that makesiushapjfty by contrast.
In your own comparative comfort there
should be pity for those who through no
fault of their own-are tilled with sorrow
and misery.
-When you breathe your prayer -of
thankfulness and'blessing over the abun
dance of your Thanksgiving dinner and
after the meal -has been eaten with so
much satisfaction—don't forget to let
some of the crumbs of your prosperity
fall to the destitute, the sick and suffer
ing who are arouud about the devasted
battlefields of Europe.
-Just think what a splendid show of
real gratitude might be had if each-of
the twenty millions of families of the
United States would spare a few crumbs
from the bounties.on the Thanksgiving
tables and a smallshare of the Christ
mas gifts, to the tRed-Cross, or to one or
more of the national committees in
charge of relief operations in almost
every warring nation of Europe at this
time. A million wounded men are in
hospitals, thousands of families are home
less and starving. Can you eat without
giving to eat? Can .you give to your
own without caring for-others?
Gratitude and charity are Siamese
Twins.
Yes, give thanks, hut in deeds as well
as .in words.
THE ISSUE THAT BEGAN THE
EUJIOPEAN WAS IS ALSO AN
JSSUE IN THE UNITED STATES.
The death of Emperor Francis Joseph
of Austria—Hungary recalls to many
newspaper editors the immediate Cause
of the great European wax. Archduke
Francib Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian
throne was assassinated in Serbia. The
Austrian emperor demanded that the
assasin and his sympathisers who were
claimed to be many in Serbia, be punish
ed and that Austrian officers and police
forces be allowed to enter Serbia and en
force these demands. Serbia did arrest
and punish the assassin and some of his
friends, but denied tbe demand of the
emperor to allow Austrian officials or
forces to enter Serbia for that purpose.
This latter was the direct cause of the
present European war.
We are calling particular attention to
this fact because it is practically the
same question as between the United
States and Mexico, and is the question
which has mostly taken the attention
and arguments of the Mexican Peace
commission which has not yet ended its
labors.
In brief, the question is, whether
when a country fails to punish crime8
eommitted by its own citizens
against for
eigners, whether tbe country to which
the victims belong, has the right to enter
tbe former country for the purpose of
punishing the offenders and incidentally
to protect its oitiieaa who happen then
from farther injury.
Or to state it concretely, after Villa
had murdered foreigners in Mexico, and
after making a deliberate assault and
massacre at Colombus, and escaping
without punishment or prospect of pun
ishment, bad tbe United States tbe right
to send an army into Mexico to arreet
Villa?
Ordinarily, where there are well estab
lished governments, this would not be
come an issue as any self respecting gov
ernment would punish such breaches,
and any demand for an outside force
or tribunal to come into its own territory
would be indignantly rejected. But A us*
tria claimed that Serbia and Serbian
authorities were sympathisers with the
plotters (against Austria, and that the
latter would not feel like searching out
and convicting the plotters against Aus
tria, -So-in Mexico, there was 'no real
government, there was no piospect of
punishment of Villa for past crimes, nor
yet-for prevention of future repetition of
of similar transgressions.
Will the invasion of Mexico finally
plunge all tbe countries on tbe American
continents into
a war
Meanwhile Villa keeps right on with
ihis villany.
Again, .the UnitediStates immediately
after the Columbus massacre also mob
ilized about all the. militia availableand
has kept them on the border as a sort of
boundary guard at considerable expense
as well as inconvenience to the rank and
tile. -During all this time until the last
few weeks no Villa or other villains were
in sight, and the-only bandits that the
militia boys had to. fight were mosquito
es, centipedes and-horned toads.
But now, after election, but when some
Vi-llarists are in -sight who are killing
Americans and-other foreigners that are
under the care and protection of the
United-States by virtue of the Monroe
doctrine, when there are declared and
known enemies in force in sight, then
we hear of these militia or parts of them
being ordered home and discharged.
-Just now also there has been a "peaoe
commission" holding solemn concaves in
order to prevent further war with Mex
ico
Putting all these things together, to
the -outside observer, the whole "war
policy" between thia country and Mexico
appears to be about as ridiculous as
could be imagined, and the status of the
American army .now in Mexico about as
absurd as it could possibly be.
An .invading army, which dares not
move south because of Carranza, and
dares not come home because of the
shame of it.
We ware about to say we wonder what
the army officers in Mexico think of
their position, but we will amend by say
iag that because they are American offi
oes we know what they think and the
way that they are expressing it (their
think) when they are in private.
