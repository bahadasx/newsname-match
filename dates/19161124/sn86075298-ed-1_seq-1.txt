FRENCH AND SERB
ARMY IN SERBIA
London, Nov. 20.-1%lonastir, in
Southern Serbia, was evacuated by the
German and Bulgarian forces which
have been defending it against the
protracted assault of the Entente
armies.
French and Serbian troops imme
diately occupied the city. By this
-move the Serbians, who for months
have been without a country, are en
abled to re-establish their capital on
their native soil.
The French and Serbians having
captured the crest of hills partly sur
rounding the valley town, the Germans
found their position untenable and
withdrew, according to Berlin, to a
new position north of Monastir.
Unofficial advices from Saloniki say
a temporary capital of Serbia will im
mediately be established at Monastir.
With the re-occupation of Monastic
the railway line from the Entente Al
lied base at Saloniki now is in Eutente
hands.
To the east and southeast of Mlona
stir the French and Serbian troops
continue to make gains in the Cerna
river region against the Teutonic al
lies.
Teuton Armies Gain.
On the Transylvanian front the Aus
tro"German armies at almost all points
-continue to make progress against the
Russian and Roumanian forces or to
`hold them back without gains when
they attack.
The latest reports from Berlin say
the Teutonic allies have forced the
narrow mountain passes leading to the
Wallachian plain of Roumania. Buch
arest reports a Roumanian advance iu
the region of Dragoslavele.
From Nov. 1 to Dec. 18 the Austro
Germans are said to have made pris
oners 189 officers and 19,388 men and
-to have captured twenty-six guns, sev
enty-two machine guns and seventeen
ammunition cars.

Perlin says that in fighting over a
front of seven and a half miles the
British met with a sanguinary reverse.
Except for insignificant gains south

French attack south of Sailly-Saillisel
met with a similar repulse.
WORLD FOOD FAMINE
PREDICTED IN ROME
Rome, Nov. 20.-Rigid economy
throughout the world in the consum -
tion of food, in view of the deficient.
crops and the extraordinary require.
meats of the European armies, is urs
ed by the International Institute of
Agriculture, which has made the most
extensive report it has isued since the
war began.
The institute says all nations aro
,confronted with a grave situation.
It is estimated that at least 2,300,
000,O00 bushels of wheat will be con
cormed in the year ending July 31
1917, and at the end of this period the
world's surplus supplies of wheat wil
have decreased to 46,000,000 bushels.
The report says it is only on account
of the fact that last year's harvests
were abundant, leaving a balance om
2 ,t00.00m bushels, that there is avail
i Wle stfh cient wheat for the year end
ing next July.
SUIT WILL NOT STOP U-BOAT

New London, Conn., Nov. 20.-Libel
proceedings instituted here against
the Eastern Forwarding company,
owners of the German subsea freight
er Deutschland will not delay it from
again starting on the homeward voy
age to Bremen. This was made plain
when the forwarding company's offi
cials were given to understand that
furnishing of sufficient bond to cover
any possible damage proceedings by
owners of the tug T. A. Scott, Jr.,
sunk on the Deutschland's interrupted
dash Thursday, would be acceptable.
An interesting part of the proceed

court the exact building cost of the
big subsea boat and the value of its
cargo may be brought out.

LAND IS NOI TAXABLE
BUT EQUITY IS TAXAELE
Below we print a letter from
Assistant U. S. Attorney Frank b.
Woody to Mr. Sam Higham relating,
to the tax question on lands under the
Flathead reclamation project. Many
inquiries are made regarding this
matter and the Pioneer has been un
able to answer them. We can not
say that the letter below has made
the matter clear, but it may help some
to figure out where they stand. The
letter is dated Butte, Montana, Nov.
2, 1916, and reads:
Dear Sir:-As I have handled the
Flathead reclamation homestead cases
almost entirely, and as Mr. Wheeler is
out of town and will not return for
some days, I am taking the liberty of
answering your letter of the 31st ult.
to him with reference to these cases.
Judge Bourquin in rendering his
decision in these cases held, in effect
that until the entryman has done
every thing necessary to be done by
him to entitle him to a patent, that is
made not only his proofs under the
homestead law and payment for the
lands, but also the proofs of additional
reclamation required by the reclama
tion act and payment of all amounts
due to the government up to the time
of making such reclamation proofs on
account of the construction and main
tenance of the reclamation system, the
lands belonged to the government and
could not be taxed, and ordered an in
junction to issue restraining the
county officers from either taxing the
lands or selling them at tax sales for
delinquent taxes.
He further held, however, that an
entryman's equity in the land is sep
arate and distinct from the land it
self, or the title to the land, and that
such equity can be taxed.
. Just what constitutes an entryman's
equity in the land is rather difficult to
determine. The improvements would
not be an equity as, the improvements
being affixed to the soil, they are a
part and parcel of the land, and to
attempt to tax them would be taxing
the land, just what the court decided
they could not do. My own idea is
that the equity is the interest the en
tryman has in the land, and that is
the amount of money he has paid to
the government as the purchase price
for the land alone at the present tima.
If, after the cost of constructing the
reclamation system is apportioned and
an entryman pays installments, from
time to time, without making the proof
of additional reclamation required by
the reclamation act, his equity might
increase in value, from time to time,
by adding to the purchase price paid
for the land the amount paid in in
stallments, so that each year tuEt
equity would increase in value the
amount of the installment paid.
I do not believe that the decision
rendered invalidates and wipes out
all back taxes. Undoubtedly it does
remove all tax liens from the lands
which may have been created by at
tempting to assess the lands, but it
is probable that the county officers can
assess the equities of the entrymen
for past years, where they have not
raid the taxes which have been as
'.sessed against the lands.
If the counties go aherd and assess
the entrymen's equities I ;m some
what at a los; ;o i nderstani how thry
can enforce the payment of the taxes
thereon. They nmay, of course, ad
vertise and sell the equiti"s, but the
mere selling of the equities wouirl
give no purchaser the right of
possession of the lands, neither do I
believe that the counties could give
any purchaser a tax deed if no re
demption was had from such sales.
The only effect assessment of the
equities might have, so far as I can
see, would be that there would appear
on the assessment books unpaid
taxes against the equities, and pur
chasers of the lands from the entry
men, or persons loaning money and
taking mortgages on the lands for
security, might insist on these taxes
being paid before purchasing or tak
ing sportgages.
I have made no examination of the
present assessment records of these
counties to acertain the value which
has been placed on these equities, altho'
I understand, that, in conformity
with Jpdge Bourquin's decision, the
different counties have only assessed
the entrymen's equities in the land.
Truly yours,
Frank Woody

RAISE IN WAGES
FOR N. P. MEN
On Thursday of last week the North
ern Pacific Railroad announced from
the St. Paul office that a voluntary in
crease in the salaries of employes who
receive less than $200 per month will
be made. At San Francisco, accord
ing to R. W. Clark, secretary to Presi
dent J. M. Hannaford, the employes at
the Northern Pacific offices were noti
fied today of an increase in salaries,
which became effective with the an
nouncement.
"We started the increase six weeks
ago in some localties and are gradually
spreading them." said Mr. Clark to
night.
"There is no flat increase to all em
ployes. Some of the lesser paid em
ployes on the coast were the first to
be affected.
"I cannot say when the salaries in
St. Paul or any other point will be in
creased, but it is the policy of tn.
company to increase salaries, gradu
ally when practical."
Increased earnings of the company,
coupled with the increased cost of liv
ing, was given as the reason for the
action of the company.
ENGINEER COVELL REPORTS
ON RONAN WATER SYSTEM
Engineer Earl D. Covell made his re
port to the town council last Monday
night on the survey of the proposed
water system for Ronan. From the
survey it is sihuwn that the intake of
the pipe line will be on Crow creek
about a mile above the A. J. Brower
farm and that the line will be approx
imately four miles long with a fall of
over 300 feet from that point to Ronan.
The town council will file their ap
plication for a water right with Su
perintendent Crowe of the reclamation
service at St. Ignatius early next week,
the mayor and councilmen and some
other Ronanites going to St. Ignatius
for that purpose. After its approval
by Mr. Crowe, the application will be
forwarded to Washington and it is be
lieved the permit will be granted with
out delay.
Estimates of the cost of construction
will be prepared in the near future and
further steps taken to insure an up-to
date water system for Ronan next
summer.
ATOW HOSTILITY
TO INJUNCTION
Organized labor forces assembled at
the convention of the American Feder
ation of Labor at Baltimore on Mon
day, unanimously adopted a resolution
urging organized labor everywhere to
make the injunction question "the par
amount issue in all of their future po
litical activities." The resolution is
said to have been brought forth by the
recent action of the railroads in secur
ing injunctions against the Brother
hood of Railway Trainmen, preventing
them from going on a strike pending
the settlement of the constitutionality
of the Adamson eight hour law.
A more radical step was taken later
when the convention unanimously
adopted a recommendation "that any
injunction dealing with the relationship
of employer and employe, and based
on the dictum that labor is property,
be disregarded, let the consequences
be what they may.

DAMAGES FIXED
BY COMMISSION
The commission appointed by Judge
Duncan in the district court some three
weeks ago to fix the damages in the
coudemnation proceedings brought by
the Northern Pacific railway against
Messrs. Howard. Jones, Larson, Lind
say, West and Mrs. Jensen, for right
of way for their line thrhugh their
places, completed its labor last Satur
day night and filed its report with
Judge Duncan on Monday. The com
mission was composed of John N.
Bailey and J. A. McGeorge of Ronan,
and Elmer Hughes of Missoula.
In the Howard case the company of
fered him $290 for right of way across
his forty acre place. The commission
allowed him $1,065.
$aSf Junes also owns a forty and the
company offered him $250. The com
mission gave him $1,015.
For passing through Mr. Larson's
eighty the railroad offered $300. The
commission raised this to $1,475.
The company thought it would be
worth $300 to them to get through
Mrs. Jensen's forty, but the commis
sion considered $1,225 about the right
price.
Lindsay was awarded $3,350 for
right of way across his 120 acres,
whereas the company only wanted to
pay around $800. In this case the road
will run between his house and barn.
necessitating the removal of both. His
improvements are large and substan
tial and he is therefore damaged to a
large extent.
West was allowed $1,550 for allowing
the company to pass through his 120
acres.
FARMERS' SHORT COURSE
USEFUL AND ENTERTAINING
The Farmers' Short Course at Round
Butte was a decided success. A large
enrollment of ladies were present every
day and were keenly interested in the
domestic science demonstrations by
Miss Rowe and the chicken lectures by
Mr. Abbey.
Dr. Hartman, state live stock spec
ialist, Mr. Hillman, state dairy expert,
and County Agriculturist J. R. Camp
b11 discussed all the different phases
of the live stock industry. Much inter
est was shown in the butchering dem
onstration on Thursday afternoon.
Two large porkers were properly
dressed and later cut up after the most
approved methods.
Mr. Perce, federal cheese expert,
gave some very interesting talks on the
cheese industry and in all probability
the not distant future will see this very
important and profitable industry flour
ishing in this vicinity.
Messrs. Campbell and Hillman in
duced our farmers to form several Com
munity Bull associations. The idea is
to buy several Shorthorn bulls of the
very best breeding to improve and
breed up the herds of the community.
Our people are to be commended on the
progressive course taken thus far. We
have every reason to expect very sat
isfactory results. The school exhibit
was very much appreciated by our
patrons. We are now planning another
such exhibit to be held sometime next
May. The very high class of the ex
hibits displayed at the community fair
was a genuine surprise to all visitors
as well as to the judges. Plans are
already being made for another such
fair to be held at Round Butte next
September, so that all prospective ex
hibitors may prepare in due time.

RAIL UNIONS AND
A. F. OF L. IN PACT
Washington, Nov. 20.-A significant
and far reaching alliance was con
tracted here between the railroad de
partment of the American Federation
of Labor and the four train service
brotherhoods, whose nation-wide strike
threat last August necessitated the
passage of the now disputed Adamson
wage law.
This affiliation joins in a common
cause approximately 800,000 railroad
workers, a little less than half the to
tal number of all those who are em
ployed in the railroad industry
throughout the country.
Object is Two-Fold.
Although no definite statement is
obtainable, no doubt is entertained in
Washington that the object of the
alliance is two-fold, to strengthen the
brotherhoods' demand for an eight
hour basic day and to aid in a move
ment of the other organized railway
workers for the same concessions.
Officials at the capital regard this
new alliance as exceedingly ominous.
in the light of the controversy over
the Adamson law, which, it is feared
'in some quarters, may again bring the
country face to face with a national
transportation strike.
Brotherhoods Are Active.
The formation of the Brotherhood
Federation alliance was not the only
salient happening in the railroad labor
situation. In fact, things began to
happen immediately after the arrival
of of the four brotherhood presidents,
William G. Lee of the trainmen, War
ren S. Stone of the engineers, W. S.
Carter of the firemen and L. E. Shep
pard, acting for A. B. Garretson of the
conductors.
The four brotherhood presidents
held an extended meeting at the old
National hotel with their four legis
lative representatives to discuss their
campaign in the coming session of
congress against what they consider
obnoxious proposals.
Announcement was made that the
four chiefs would address the conven
tion of the American Federation of La
bor at Baltimore.
BANDITS MURDER
AGED AMERICAN
El Paso, Thxas; Nov. 20.-An un
identified Ameriean was killed when
a Villa band took Jiminez, and four
Americans were seen under a guard of
bandits at Parral during Villa's occu
pation of that town, according to re
ports, believed by federal agents to
be authentic, brought to the border
by refugees.
Refugees further state that the dis
trict between Parral and Jiminez has
been cleared by Villa's followers of
more than 200 Chinese. The American
killed at Jiminez was described as
about sixty years old and known to be
from Torreon on his way to Chihuahua
City. He was murdered, the refugees
said, in the Jiminez hotel and his body
lay for some time in front of the
building, when, after being robbed of
clothing and valuables, it was placed
on a bonfire.
Mexican Women Burned.
The same refugees also say that two
Mexican women who had married Chi
Chinese and their five half Chinese
children were found and thrown alive
into the fire and cremated in sight of
the crowd. The bodies of the seven
murdered Chinese, according to the
same authority, were seen in the
streets of the town.
Two Mexicans who escaped from
Parral affirm that they saw four Amer
icans there under a Villa guard. They
also said they heard that the Amer
icans working at the Alvarado mines
escaped the bandits.
Another report brought to the bor
der was to the effect that the bodies
of thirty-five Gypsies of both sexes
were seen on the roadside near Par
ral, murdered and robbed by Villa
bandits.
All foreigners that Villa has caught.
except the Japanese and Germans,
have been put to death, the reports
agree, and even the Germans are said
to have suffered, at least in the in
stance of Theodore Hoemuller of Par
ral. Various - reports of Hoensulikr'a
death have been received here during
the past week.
JOINT CONFERENCE
CERTAIN TO END SOON
Washington, Nov. 20.-Armed with
President Wilson's complete approval
of his course, Secretary Lane will re
turn to Atlantic City today, deter
mined to bring the sessions of the
American-Mexican joint commission to
an early conclusion.
lie still is hopeful an agreement as
to the border situation can be reached,
but it was clearly indicated in official
circles that the joint conference is
entering on its tinal phase, agreement
or no agreement.
Army officials believe the American
expeditonary force soon will be mov
ing toward the border, yegardless of
the turn events may take at Atlantic
City. In its present position, many
officers hold the expediton would be
of no strategic value should general
hostilities break out.
If the commission dissolves, it Is
believed there will remain no reason
for keeping the expedition where it is.
159 DEAD IN MEXICAN WRECK
Many Others Seriously injured When
Train Rolls Down a Cliff.
Laredo, Texas, Nov. 20.-One hun
dred and fifty-nine persons were killed
and many more or less seriously in
jured in a railroad wreck on the Inter
oceanic line to Vera Cruz, between
Dehesa and San Miguel, near .Jalapa,
Nov. 12. according to reliable reports
received here.
The wreck is said to have been dua
to the engineer running at too high a
rate of speed over a dangerous part
of the road.
According to this information all ex
cept one of the five cars of the train
left the track and rolled over a cliff.
The passengers were literally ground
to pieces. No Americans were among
the dead, it was said.
FOUR KILLED IN AUTO RACE
Los Angeles Driver Swerves From
Course and Causes Fatalities.
Santa Monica, Cal., Nov. 20.--Four
persons were killed, one a woman, and
three were injured in the seventh an
nual international prize automobile
road race here. The event was won
by Johnny Aitken, driving as a relief
for Howard Wilcox.
Lewis Jackson, a Los Angeles
driver, on the thirteenth lap swerved
into one of the palm trees lining the
course and caused his own death and
that of three others.
