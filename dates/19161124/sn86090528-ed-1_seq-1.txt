ist bodies, the captains of the differ
ent teams within each Christian En
deavor organization are trying to see
which' church society within the lim
its of a twelve weeks campaign can
secure the largest number of effi
cient members. Each young peoples'
organization is to work within the
field of their own church and urge
those to join who -do not belong to
any other church or Christian Endeav

worship, Miss Minnine Singleton; so
cial service, Miss Esther Schafer; lit
erary, Miss Ruth Martin; missions,
Miss Hallie Grimsley; Epworth Era
agent, Miss Viola Weir. For the pres
ent campaign the league Ib divided in
to four sides with the following cap
tains: "Reds," Miss Valedia Pross;
Blues," Miss Hallie Grimsley; "Gold,"
Miss Helen Kimbro; "Green," Norman
Duncan. These four captains and
Miss Marian Duncan arranged the
"Field Meet," Dr. Lawrence L. Cohen,
the pastor, acting as field manager,
with Mr. Sam Pack as judge and Mr.

lows: 1 Stand Broad Grin; 2 Dis
cus Throw; 3 Nine Foot Dash; 4
Shot Put; 5 Low Hurdle Race; 6
Hammer Throw; 7 Boys' Relay

the work of the contestants each team,
led by their "yell loader," kept the

yells." The happy party after being
served with refreshments reluctantly
broke up to continue the contest some
future day.

GRAVE PERIL
Absence of Sidewalks on Minnesota Be
tween Ninth and Tenth Presents Daily
Risk to West School Pnpils
EDUCATION OFFICERS
ADDRESS CITY DADS
Superintendent Ramey and President Hayes
of School Board Say Tragedy is
Imminent at Ail Times
That several small pupils who are
attending1 the West school have not
been killed by both speeding and slow
running automobiles Is a marvel, was
the assertion made by President J. Q
Mayes of the board of education and
Professor W. F. Rumey, superintend
cnt of public schools at the regular
session of the city council last night
The imminent peril to life and limb
to which these little tots are dally sub
jected during the school term was
brought out so clearly by the speak
ers that the street and alley commit
tee was instructed to invea'gfltn the
matter and decide upon the necessity
for placing a sidewalk either on the
north or the south side of Minnesota
avenue between Ninth and Tenth
streets.
The condition of the street, In the
absence of sidewalks, Is such that
children have practically no alterna
tive except to walk In the middle of
the street and notwithstanding the dil
igence which is exercised by the prin
cipal and teachers of the schools in
conforming with the injunction of tb 5
superintendent to observe the closest
watch over the youngsters, there 1b
no t'ssurance that at any noon hour or
immcdiaely succeeding the dismissal
of school In the afternoon a frightful
tn.j-edy might not occur.
Mr. Mayes cited incidents of very
narrow escapes which have come un
der hl observation and one in partic
ular to which he was one of the par
ties. WhUo driving at a very low rate
of ppeed between Ninth and Tenth
ptreets neveral children rushed toward
his car waving and hailing him In a
happy manner and it was only becausn
ho was able to turn the machine Into
the curb quickly enough that one or
more of the youngsters was no eith
er killed or crippled.
He had received many complaints
and expressions of anxiety on the part
of parents and was himself a witness
to the jeopardy In which pupils of the
West school are constantly placed.
With a sidewalk on either or both
sides of the street the teachers would
be more successful in keeping their
wards out of that particular street,
made more dangerous by a high grade.
Superintendent Ramey supplement
eti the statement or Mr. Mayes ami
asked that the council should not wait
until three or four children are killei
before making proper provisions for
ti'.olr safely.
Councilman Hayes moved that the
matter be referred to the street and
ally connt'Ittee for immediate atten
tion. Councilman DuBose suggesed that
until a remedy is applied the children
be kept off the streets.
Councilman Hayes asked Mr. Du
Bose to suggest some manner In
which this could be done but no solu
tion was offered.
Children are children, it was point
ed oi. t. daring, reckless and full of
life and as there is no other way to
get out except to go into the middle
of the street the construction of a side
walk Js imperative in order to assure
spfety of life and limb.

NUMBER 280
CITY DADS
TO CONSIDER
BILL LATER
Did Not Take Up Building Ordinance
Which Contains Many Important
Provisions
OFFICIAL FIRE TEST
TOMORROW AFTERNOON
Chief ol Police Phillips Instructed to Have
Full Force to Control Expected
Great Crowd
None of the Important matters
which were to come up before the reg
ular session of the city council last
night received definite attention for
specific reasons. The questionable
automobile license clause could not be
handled owing to the absence of
three members, Councilmen Neal, Linn
and McKay. Without at least six
members preset,: the council was not
disposed to consider the Important
proposed building ordinance which Is
calculated to be a factor in the reduc
tion of fire Insurance premiums paid
by Chickasha property owners. This
was also the case with the motion pic
ture ordinance.
After considerable discussion It was
decided that the building ordinance
should be taken up, considered and
passed or rejected sectloa by section
but that it would be wise to consider
this at a special meeting when It is
probable the council might have' the
advice of some member of the state
tiro marshal's office or an official of
the underwriter's bureau.
Fire Chief Gattls, when asked for
an opinion, believed that one of the
officers who is scheduled to be here
for the official test of the $9,000 motor
fire truck at 1 o'clock Saturday after
noon, would be competent to pass up
on the extent to which the council
might go in modifying the proposed
ordinance and at the same time keep
well within the limits which should
insure a reduction in the key rate for
Chickasha. The chief expressed the
opinion that several sections in the
bill which on first thought might work
a. hardship on Chfikasha property
owners in the residential ulstnet
might be stricken out without jeop
ardizing the lowered rate.
Fire Chief GatttB was charged with
arranging for a meeting between the
necessary official and the city coun
cil on Saturday at an hour to be agreed
?pon later.
Councilman Hayes asked that Inas
much as the fire engine test is to be
made at 1 o'clock Saturday afternoon
at the corner of Fourth and Chicka
sha, an hour when that portion of the
city's thoroughfare is likely to be
most congested, that Chief of Police
Ben Phillips be instructed to have the
police force on hand to keep order
and control the large crowd which U
expected to be present.
City Treasurer Clark told the eoun
II of the preparation of a suit In con
nection with the reimbursement to
the paving tax payers of the $20,000
penalties which Is now being held !n
the city treasury.
That the arrangement for loading
and unloading wagons at the Santa
Fe freight house Is a acuse of con
stant annoyance and Inconvenience to
pedestrians in that part of the city
wus explained to the council by L. C.
Wright of the Hart Cotton Machine
company who asked that some reme
dy be applied.
The platform is so situated that pe
destrians are often obliged to wait
ten or fifteen minutes until a large
wagon is unloaded. It was suggested
that an opening be made for this traf
fic between the freight house and the
north end of the grounds.
On motion of Councilman Caneman
the city attorney was instructed to
investigate the matter in order that
a proper ordinance might be drawn
up for consideration ai. a future meet
ting. Later it was decided that the
mayor and the city attorney should
look after the metter.
