Lansing Says Most of the Attacks
Have Been Made in Accordance
with International Law
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov 24 State depart
ment' officials have let it become
known that the department has adopt
ed a policy of silence regarding the
submarine situation. It was indicat
ed that such a course was necessary
because most of the cases of German
submarine attacks, which have been
investigated, developed no violation of
international law and they said a pre
mature discussion is calculated to stir
up useless excitement in the United
States.
With no less than ten inquiries on
attacks on American vessels and ships
carrying American citizens 'pending
in Berlin, Mr. Lansing declined to
even talk about the cabled reports
from Berlin.

I'JILL FORECAST FOR THE NEXT TERM THE FQR-
EICII POLICY Of Mil
New York, Nov. . 23. A special
from .Washington to the Herald says:
Germany apparently has violated
her pledges to the United States by
torpedoing an unresisting merchant
ship without warning and by menac
ing the lives of American citizens in
violation of the rules of law and the
dictates of humanity.
Mr. Lansing, secretary of . state,
went to the cabinet conference at the
White House this morning with sworn
testimony to this effect in his posses
sion. It was the testimony of Amer-
ican survivors from the steamship
Marina. ;
The testimony leaves no , loophole
for defense to Germany nor does it
afford the United States government
any chance to palliate the offence.
The Marina was torpedoed without
warning at half -past three o'clock p.
m., and the submarine commander
made no move to succor the survivors,
left in small boats on a heavy sea
which grew worse as night drew on.
For more than thirty hours some of
those survivors, two score of them
American citizens, drifted ' in the
small boats in danger of their lives.
Six Americans lost; their lives. And
the method of attack could not have
been more stealthy, more violative of
every dictum of fair play. The sub
marine hid her identity. She did not
follow the invariable rule of war
ships in action of hoisting her colors.
The first torpedo fired destroyed the
wireless aboar dthe. Marina so that
no cal If or 'help could be sent. , The
survivors were huddled ' into J., small
boats, and then ; the submarine left
them, although it appears that no
risk, save the risk of detection in
crime, would have been invited by the
submarine in undertaking Jo aid the
survivors, as some - submarine com
manders have done. ,
But what is to be done about this?
That is still unknown in .Washington.
Of course, representations will be
made to Berlin. . The , whole question
is in what spirit will those represen
tations be made.
1 When that question is answered by
the decision of President Wilson the
American people will know what is to
be the bent and aim of the nation's
foreign policy for the next four years.
The answer cannot be long delayed.
There is a long list of casses about
whic ; hthe United States must ad
dress Germany. In reply to informal
inquiries from the American embassy
in Berlin the German -foreign office,
according to cable dispatches today,
has submitted a defense- in several in
stances of submarine attacks, includ
ing attacks upon American ships.
When this statement from the Ger
man government is received, within a
day or two, the administration will
begin the preparation of its represen
tations to Germany. These will date
back to and include the raid of the
U-53 off Nantucket lightship. But the
Marina case will serve as the focal

MOVE TO ORGANIZE
REAL ESTATE MEN
, Geo. E. Brown, Scriven Dozier, P.
J. Lannayene and C. C. Kirby made
up a party of gentlemen who arrived
in the city from Jacksonville Wed
nesday evening, making the trip in a
Jeffrey car. These gentlemen made
the "Sun an agreeable call yesterday
morning. They are interested in the
oganization of the reputable real es
tate men of Florida into an organiza
tion that will distinguish them from
the "land sharks," so frequently oper
a ting under "the guise of real estate
dealers.
To this end an organization meet
ing will be held in Jacksonville on
December 6, and speaking of the ben
efits to be realized, Mr. Dozier stated
that the factors of the organization
were: To establish and standardize
the business of real estate dealing on
brokerage or otherwise, so that it will
obtain the respect and confidence of
the public, both buyer and seller. To
establish and maintain the dignit and
responsibility of its members in their
duty to the public To institute rules
and regulations, customs and practice
in the handling of real properties. To
cultivate good fellowship among its
members, in their buying, seeling and
handling real properties. To organ
ize a center of effort for adequate eco
nomic civic development. To procure
just and even, taxation. To promote
such a system of law and administra
tion as shall protect our citizens, en
courage industry, and attract a desir
able population, such as our advan
tages, entitle us to. Especially to
guard and advance the interests of
real estate owners and to devise, ad
vocate and support such legislation,
state and municipal, as is calculated
to improve our cities, towns and com
munities, so far as is possible and
protect them ; against unscrupulous
persons, misrepresentations, deception
and fraud, such as we hear or know
are being practiced to an alarming ex
tent. '
Such j an " organization, on the high
plane proposed will prove of untold
value to Florida, and the Sun hopes

County Fair
Everything is lining up in good
shape for the opening of our fair on
Tuesday, thes 28th. But there are a few
last words of information that may
save someone inconvenience.
Cars will be parked same as last
year on the vacant ground north of
the woman's building. Doctor's cars
south, of the ofSce building.
Tickets will be on sale beginning '
Saturday at Gerig's and Court Phar
macy. Exhibitor's tickets will be sold
at the grounds only. Please get these
if possible on Saturday afternoon or
Monday. ' -
; , You can make entries any , time
after 9 a. m. Saturday. Stop at the
ticket office at the entrance to the
grounds and get your entry number 1
ticket. Then take this ticket to all
the different departments in which
you wish to make entries. Your en
try number will be the same in all de
partments, and you will keep your
entry card and bring same when you
come to remove your exhibits.
Bring all exhibits that you possibly
can in your wagons or cars as the ex
press company has refused to make us
rates this year. In sending your ex-
hibits by express it will be necessary
to send same express prepaid.
Those exhibiting cooking and bak
ing that does not win a prize will be
permitted to remove same . any time
after judging i3 completed in order
that there be as little needless waste
as possible. This will not be compul
sory however. .
A number have asked about the
charge of ten cents at the gate at
night. This ten-cent night gate gives
you the privilege of seeing on the mid
way three attractions as free acts
that if you were to see them inside a
tent would cost you ten cents each.
There are many who would avail
themselves of the privilege of going
to see these three acts if they can see
them for ten cents, who would only be
able to see one ten-cent show other
wise. With this thought in mind we
decided on the night gate fee of ten
cents. .
Please remember that the ladies of
the civic committee of the Woman's
Club will serve dinners at the dinner
booth and lunch at the building where
the ladies of the Christian church
have served heretofore. The dinners
and lunches will be worth while, well
cooked and nicely served. Don't fail
