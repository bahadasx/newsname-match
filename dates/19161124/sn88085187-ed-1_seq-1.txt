W. E. Henry, director of the lTni
versity of Washington library and

at the suggestion of Librarian
Kaiser and offered his services
free in making a detailed survey.
As the result of his survey,
Henry, in his report to the board,
declared that none of the branches
could bo maintained even on part

He also declared that the Ta

far more service than almost any
other similar library in the coun
try at a cost per person served and
per volume circulated far below
the average.
In other words, he concluded
that the library was offering a

which was all out of proportion to
the amount of funds provided by
the people of the city for Its main
tenance.
The retrenchment plans will call
for a nine per cent cut In the sal

The stock room of the Cole-

by a fire which started at 8
o'clock Friday morning.
The damage was mostly done
by smoke and water. The blaze
was confined to the upper floor
on the Commerce street entrance,
and the main store was touched
only slightly.
The origin of the blaze has not
been determined. A couple of
boys employed in the store were
In the stock room when the fire
started. It is thought possible
one of them may have dropped a
lighted match on the floor.
A small blaze, starting in a
waste basket in the law offices of
Gordon & Easterday on the 11th
floor of the National Realty
building called out the fire de
partment an hour later.
Judge Gordon, It was reported,
dropped a cigar stub or a match
Into the waste basket, Igniting a

his desk.
As the National Realty building
Is supposed to be a fireproof
