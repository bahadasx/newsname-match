DOMESTIC SCIENCE DEPART
MENT DOING PRACTICAL WOR
The girls of the Domestic Science
Department, under the direction of
Miss Ruth Wood, are doing a great
many practical things in their course
f study this year. The girls have
een giving weekly receptions and in
iting their teachers and intimate
Sriends that they may have experience
in the managing and carrying on a
"unction of this sort.
On Thursday afternoon, November
th, Miss Scott entertained her friend
'Mrs. Ford" who has just returned
'from a trip to Europe. The guests
were the high school teachers. Re
freshments consisted of Scotch 5
o'clock teas, peanut wafers, chocolate
nut bar and coffee. Miss Irene Bess
assisted the hostess by pouring.
On the afternoon of November 16th,
Miss Isham entertained her friend
"Madam Le Brun" the noted singer
from Paris. The Lincoln school
teachers, also Mr. Neal and Mr. Clif
ford were guests. The young ladies
served refreshments, which consisted
of horseradish, lennox and mosaic
sandwiches with porcupine salad and
coffee. Miss Bly Sanberg poured for
Miss Isham.
Girls Expect to Give More Receptions
Miss Wood expects to have the
girls of this department give at least
three more receptions of this sort dur
ing the school year, along with other
types of entertainment, which should
be understood by the young ladies of
each progressive community. Many
of these girls are taking a course in
Household Management, which Miss
Wood is offering this semester and
which in itself will be of great value to
the members of the class. The sub
ject consists of study of the various
problems of cause and effect, with re
gard to household conditions and the
things which govern the expense ele
ment in housekeeping. The class lias
made several trips to various mercan
tile establishments of the city to study
first hand many articles that are re
quired in the home. They learn to
apply practical tests to fabrics and
foods in order that the pudity of them
may be ascertained. This particular
branch of the work is especially valu
able at a time like the present, when
war conditions have depleted many
important household supplies and
cheap substitutes are being offered
in their places.
Cafeteria to Start Soon.
The Domestic Science Department
will open the Cafteria soon after
Xmas. On account of the excellent
weather conditions that have been
prevailing and the numerous changes
that have been made in the Domestic
Science Department this year, the
serving of hot luncheons to students
has not been taken up. It is expected,
however, this work will commence
after the Xmas recess.
School Out for Thanksgiving.
School will close "on Wednesday
afternoon November 29th, for Thanks
giving. The regular session will take
up again on Monday morning, Decem
ber 4th. Many of the grades are
planning Thanksgiving exercises for
the benefit of the children, and the
boys and girls are looking forward to
this phase of their year's work with a
great deal of interest.

The Parent -Teachers Association of
the Washington building has pur
chased a slide for the children of their
school, which will be instaled soon.
The slide purchased is a standard type
which is used throughout the city play
grounds of Chicago, and is furnished
by Marshall Field and company of
that city.
Caldwell Defeated Emmett.
Caldwell high school eleven de
feated Emmett decisively last Satur
day afternoon. On account of the ab
sence of Wilson, Huett and Cook
from the first half the team made a
very poor showing. It was, however,
Houghton's desire to give as many as
possible of the substitute players ex
perience in an actual game. The Em
mett eleven was able to hold Caldwell
machine to a scoreless half. During
the last half of the game "Wilson,
Huett and Cook were put into their
places and the machine went charging
up and down the field for a score of
41 to 0. Emmet was unable to get
within striking distance of the Cald
well goal at any time during the
game. Breshears got away for a long
run of about 80 yards for a touch
down; he secured the ball on a punt.
JOHN JESSEN ONLY DIRECTOR
NOMINATED AT MIDDLETON
Tribune Made Error in Statement
Giving Wrong Impression.
At a meeting of the Settlers' Recla
mation association held at Middleton,
November 9th, John Jessen was nomi
nated for director of the Black Can
yon Irrigation District. Mr. Jessen
was the only nominee of this associa
tion.
Mr. W. S. Hawkes is a candidate for
re-election in the district, however,
as stated by The Tribune, but he was
not nominated at the meeting which
placed Mr. Jessen in nomination.
The error of The Tribune has been
called to our attention. We trust that
the foregoing statement clears up any
erroneous impression that may have
been created by this newspaper.
BOYS ON BORDER
TO HAVE BIG FEED
Thanks to the relatives and friends
of the boys on the border. Company
G's Thanksgiving dinner was started
south Tuesday, the 21st, and if all
goes well, will reach Nogales by the
29th, just in time to insure a good
roast for the eleven turkeys which
formed the key note of this feast.
The committee in charge of the din
ner report a most generous response
to the invitation to donate materials,
the list when completed including be
sides the turkeys, thirty plum pud
dings, fourteen loaves of nut bread,
four quarts of salad dressing, twelve
quarts of pickles and relishes of var
ious kinds, twenty-five glasses of
jelly, one pail of honey, two devil food
cakes and six fruit cakes, fourteen
pounds of butter, eleven quarts of
cranberries, one quart of marmalade,
bread by the wholesale, fifty pounds
of candy, and cigars for all.
Platters were sent for the turkey,
oil-cloth to cover the wooden tables
and tiny American flags as favors.
The hospital was remembered with
four chickens, a half dozen cans of
fruit and a dozen glasses of jelly. Be
lieving that vegetables could be pur
chased near the camp cheaper than to
sen them, money was sent in lieu
of the roots—those specified being
potatoes sweet and Irish, parsnips and
caibbage. -Transportation charges
figured up between $35 and $40.
The candy was made and con
tributed by the pupils of the college
and the high school. Out-of-town
contribution were sent in through
Mrs. Howard of Roswell, Mrs. Foote
of Middleton and Mrs. Bates of Par
ma. The consignment was prepared
and packed bv loving hands and the
big dinner will be a tangible reminder
that home-folks have not forgotten
tiie home-hungry boys on the border.
Some would-be donors who were
too late in their proffers for the
Thanksgiving feast asked to be al
lowed to contribute to a Christmas
dinner should Company G not be re
called before that time, and it is safe
to assume that another round of the
good things that mother used to make
will be most acceptable about holiday
time.

CALDWELL WILL 60 TO
WEISER SEVERAL
Caldwell football enthusiasts to the
number of 250 will leave here at noon
Friday for Weiser where the Weiser
and Caldwell high school football
teams clash for the championship of
southwestern Idaho. The Commer
cial club special train carrying the
Caldwell team, band and rooters will
leave at 11:30, arriving at Weiser at
2 o'clock. Stops will be made at Par
ma, Nyssa, Ontario, and Payette to
enable fans from those places to at
tend. The Oregon Short Line has
granted a special round trip rate of
$1.50 form Caldwell and a rate of two
cents per mile from intermediate
points.
That the Caldwell team faces the
crucial test of the season is the opin
ion of football followers. On com
parative scores the Weiser aggrega
tion has a distinct advantage and has
demontsrated throughout the season
that it possesses a powerful offensive,
scoring practically at will in prac
tically every game played.
Coach Houghton, of the local squad
has been working the men hard dur
ing the last week in preparation for
the game. Injuries to a number of the
Caldwell team has materially lessened
the prospects of victory and followers
of the team are pessimistic regarding
the outcome. The squad is grimly
determined, however, and the fighting
spirit for which Caldwell high school
teams are noted will be very much in
tv.'dence.
The committee in charge of the
train urges every one who intends to
make the trip to secure their railroad
tickets early. The train will leave on
schedule time and will not be held for
late arrivals. Orange and black
badges, the high school football
colors will b< provided excursionist»
on the train.

ADDITION TO THE HIGH
ing.
SCHOOL BUILDING IS
CONTEMPLATED
If everything works out as it should,
Caldwell is in line for an addition to
her high school which will accommo
date the present school attendance
and anticipate a healthy growth for a
few years to come. The building at
present is wholly inadequate. The
assembly has to be supplemented by
an overflow in the a class room for
general exercises, and there are not
rooms enough to accommodate the
various classes without undue crowd
It is up to the school board to sup
ply this pressing need, and the matter
lias been under consideration for some
time past. One of the plans under ad
visement contemplates the formation
of a junior and a senior high school,
the former to include 7th, 8th and 9th
grade pupils, and the latter 10th, 11th
and 12th grades. Under this plan, the
congestion in both the Lincoln and
the Washington buildings would be
relieved, and as the tw;o grades
dropped would be cared for in the en
larged high school building. Either
this or the erection of another grade
building is an imperative necessity
before the beginning of another school
year, and since either alternative
means a bond issue, the matter is one
of vital interest to the entire com
munity. Using the present high school
building as a central unit, wjngs could
be added an either side at a cost of
perhaps $60,000, which would furnish
an adequate working plant for some
years to come.
The matter was discussed at the
regular meeting of the school board
last evening.
CALDWELL IS IDAHO
POULTRY CENTER
The five poultry dealers in this city
have just about concluded the Thanks
giving clean-up, and the totals make
some interesting reading.
The Farmers' Equity operates at
Caldwell, Payette and Nampa, and ex
pects its turkey receipts alone from
these three points to spell something
like $50,000. This firm has gathered
14,000 pounds of turkeys from the sec
tions around Caldwell, which at 20c
per pound, the buyer's price, means a
come-back of nearly $3000 to the
rancher for this nice little side issue.
The Equity ships to Seattle, most of
the stuff gathered here being sent
out from Nampa, which accounts in a
measure for some big figures over
there.
The Mutual Creamery has handled
during the month of November 40,000
pounds of turkeys and other birds, or
about $8,000 worth. They ship to
Boise from which point the poultry is
sent out in car load lots to various
buying points.
March and Breshears have collected
and disbursed a car and a half of tur
keys and mixed fowls, about 30,000
pounds, or about $5,0000 worth from
the rancher's standpoint. A half car
of this was contributed to Nampa for
her Boston shipment last week.
The Hazlewood Creamery Co., sent
out a car of turkeys to Spokane which
figures 20,(XX) pounds or in the neigh
borhood of $4 000.
The Caldwell Ice and Cold Storage
Co., has a total of 24,000 pounds of
Thanksgiving essence in one of its
zero rooms awaiting transportatian to
Butte. Another 10,000 brings their
amount on hand up to 34,000 lbs
which means another $4000 or $5000
to the ranchers round about.
The aggregate of 140,000 is figured
mostly on the basis of turkey prices
since more of these than any other
birds were handled, and the dollars
exchanged mount up toward the
$25,000 mark. This by no means rep
resents the output of turkeys and
other fowls around Caldwell, as
takes no account of the large numbers
purchased directly by agents of buy
ing concerns who deal direct with the
farmers, but the figures show some
thing of the scope of this growing in
dustry.
WIFE'S SUIT DISMISSED;
HUSBAND STARTS ACTION

wedding nests last Sunday. At the

to manhood in this city. The young
people made a safe get-away to Boise

of good wishes attends them.

CIVILIZATION MOST
WONDERFUL FILM
On Friday the wonder feature
"Civilization" comes to the Bungalow
theatre for a two days engagement.
The Evening Telegram of Portland
on September 2, has the following
article:
"Civilization," the spectaular and
convincing sermon for civilization as
against war, which has been running
two weeks at the Heilig theatre, will
stay for another week in Portland. It
is probable this will be the last week
of the film, which has been proclaimed
the greatest achievement in motion
picture photography and plot writing
since the moving picture became an
institution.
The film has been one of the great
est successes of moving pictures yet
produced, not alone in Portland, but
in all other cities where it has shown.
It is a large entertainment; inspired
by a purpose and representing $1,000,
000 outlay and a year and a half in
time for the production.
From a speculative viewpoint
"Civilization" is a wonder play. It
combines all that has been evolved in
motion picture art and at the same
time brings the essence of grand
opera and the essentials of the speak
ing stage into play. The picture as it
has thrilled and entertained thousands
during the last two weeks at the
Heilig, is combined with a veritable
grand opera score written by the
brilliant young composer, Victor L.
Schertzinger, 40 speaking actors in an
impressive prologue and an orchestral
nd pipe organ accompaniment. The
releasing of a flock of doves at the
close of the performance is a unique
novelty.
Basically the photoplay deals with
war, and Thomas H. Ince, the pro
ducer, has provided a war setting far
ahead of any other attempted by mo
tion picture geniuses. The scenes ap
proach realitv of war more nearly than
it was believed possible. War-ships in
battle, submarines in action, torpedoes
plowing through the water, trench
fighting, the wrecking of an ocean
liner, engagements between whole ar
mies, a naval encounter between op
posing fleets, an aerial battle, indus
trial destruction in the wake of land
battle—all these and many more thirll
ing and impressive incidents are gath
ered together into the picture, through
which runs a most appealing love
story and a pretty picture of mother
love. One can never forget Baby
Reed in "Civilization" once it is seen.

Lieutenant M. G. McConnell is
