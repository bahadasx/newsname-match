Paris. No meduls are pinned on the
breasts of the dogs of war, but they
have ployed u wonderful part as as
sistants to the ambulance corps, on
patrol duty, currying dispatches, and
dragging machine guns Into action for
the Belgians and others.
In addition to their work on the bat
tlefield, dogs did much to aid refugees.
They took their masters and their
families out of the line of invasion.
War correspondents have told how
,, much sagacity and courage the Bel
gian draught dogs displayed upon the
battlefield at Hnelen, where with the
aid of the Lewis machine gun they
held back for a time the German ad
vance through Belgium.
Just how muny wounded men ou
both sides of the firing line have! been
saved by sheep dogs and other breeds
probably never will be known. These
dogs have been trained to search for
wounded, and by taking n man's cap
to headquarters in the field a trained
nurse or doctor follows the dog, who
leads back to the place where the
man is lying. Frequently a wounded
man with his last ounce of strength
will use It to drug himself out of the
line of Are. It Is In the out-of-the-way
places that the dog has been purtlcu
uarly valuable.
Training War Dogs.
Europe has been training dogs for
years to the work which they did upon
'Jc battlefield.
Those trained dogs immediately be
came attached to the Bed Cross work
and many of them gave up their lives
in aiding humans.
There Is a story told of Belgium
dogs which aided their masters. The
Belgians, surrounded so that it seemed
hopeless; to break through, probably
would have been destroyed but for the
Idea of a captain In charge of what
was left of the machine-gun section.
He gave orders to loose the dogs from
the guns, and to encourage the dogs to
Hint; themselves upon the enemy. The
dogs did it with such telling effect that
they made a lane through which some
of the Belgian gunners escaped.
Sergeant Major I'oulsslgue's dog
Artemis was wounded in the Argonne.
Lying beside his master In the trench
at a listening post he smelled the Ger
man advance guards and indicated a
warning of the enemy's approach.
Sergeant Pouisslguc ordered the dog
back to warn the regiment to be on
the alert. The dog, however, refused
to go, when suddenly there was a
slight noise behind the listening sol
dier and Artemis sprang over the para
pet and flung himself at the throat of
a German soldier. In the fight between
man and beast a bullet went through
his right front leg. Later the dog re
covered. On another occasion, when his mas
ter was attached to the Ninety-fourth
regiment of Infantry in the Ypres sec
tor, the soldier was having a fierce
hand-to-hand fight with one German
while the other was slipping up to
bayonet him from behind. Artemis
leaped at the tatter's throat and fin
ished him. The dog's roaster also got
the better of his adversary.

Dogs on both sides do sentry duty at
night, carry messages buck to line with
more security thun men and give no
tice of the advance of the enemy by
barking. These dogs are trained to
bark whenever a stranger approaches
within 200 yards, and surprise attacks
have often been frustrated by this ad
vance knowledge.
According to the Gazette de Franco
a certain French regiment possesses a
dog which is sent out from advanced
sentry posts at night with a telephone
strapped over his mouth and a wire
connecting the instrument with the
post. If the dog hears the Germans
approaching he barks quietly Into the
telephone.

Madame Miriam Ardini, a Native
American, Takes Delight In
Housekeeping Work.
Every prima donna has a tempera
ment, and every temperament pos
sessed by a prima donnn Is nursed and
cultured and made the most of. As a
general rule the temperament pos
sessed by prima donnas prevents them
trom accustoming themselves to the
ordinary tilings of life. Exceptions
there are to this rule as to every other.
The big exception Is Madame Miriam
Ardini, an opera singer who Is gifted
not only with remarkable talent as a
piano virtuoso and composer, but
is also the possessor of a beautiful
lyric voice which has won her fame
In nil the large cities of Europe.
While the name suggests the foreign,
Madame Ardini is a New Yorker born
and bred. As one of nine children, she
soon learned the fundamentals of
housekeeping. Then it wus discovered
that she wus possessed of a voice
which brought forth exclamations of
surprise from no less a person than
the noted Bonci of the Metropolitan
Opera company. She gave up her do
mestic Inclinations and started study
ing for the prima donna's goal. Back
again In her native land after years
of study abroad, she has surprised her
circle of friends not by her singing but
by her cooking. All the dishes pluced
before the guests were cooked by

abroad the natives of Italy were
shocked because mudume did her own
shopping. There no woman does her
own shopping, but delegates it to her
servants.

"I have retired from the mat," says
Frank Gotch, the world's champion
wrestler, "not because I do not think
I am capable of defeating them all,

wrestlers Is that they are mechanical.
They do not use their brains In train

That makes me think. And It also
makes every muscle employed the

GRIDIRON ELEVENS
USING BUCKING
When thousands of people are
thrilled by the struggle of two college
football teams they gather from the
Intricate moves and counter-moves and
from the high example of team play
that the contestants have given an un:
usual amount of their time to prac
tice In order to reach this- advanced
state of development. Not only do the
crowds which view the Intercollegiate
contests reach this conclusion, but
those who attack intercollegiate sport
and who seek to reform it claim that
one of Its grandest problems Is to re
duce the great amount of time utilized
In the practice of teams for games.
A study of the facts brings to light
the surprising information that college
athletic teams, especially football elev
ens, which are more highly perfected
than other Intercollegiate athletic or
ganizations, are developed In consider
ably less time than Is generally sup
posed. And In some Instances not
more thnn six hours u week Is given
over to practice.
All of this Is u result of scientific
FUMBLE IN FOOTBALL GAME
Arthur Poe, Famous End on Former
Princeton Teams, Would Inflict
Distance Penalty.
From Arthur Poe, the famous end on
the Princeton teams of iw8 and isoo,
cornea a suggestion that n fumble In
football should not result In the loss
of the ball, but should Incur n dis
tance penalty only. This Is a radical
suggestion, but not one to be dis
missed without careful consideration.
Poe, it will be recalled, defeated
Yale in 1808 by getting the ball out of
a Yale halfback's arms Just as the lat
ter was scoring on Princeton, where
upon Poe ran the entire length of the
field for the winning touchdown.
C. C. Mahan of Princeton Tackling
Dummy.
Hence, Poc's suggestion carries with
It the personal prestige of a great
player who won u great game as the
result of a technical fumble.
Poe contends that the entire work
of a year, coaches, councils during the
winter, Individual practice of the play
ers In spring and summer and com
bined coaching and practice through
out an entire fall should not be nulli
fied by a fumble which can happen at
any time to the very best of players,
has been designated by the most repre
henslhle word in football, "fluke," car
rying satisfaction to a winning team
but not credit.
Poe's suggestion is that a fumble be
penalized by the loss of 10 yards, or
if made within one's 15-yard line, by
half the distance to the goal line, the
rambler's side still to retain posses
sion of the ball. This In general is the
suggestion. It, of course. Involves de

given by their athletic authorities for
the failure of these two teams to-show

less, In 1013, because Pilchard -andM
