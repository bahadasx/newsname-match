Corrective Legislation Is

ANOTHER HEARING
ON ADAMSON ACT
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 23.—
Counsel In conference over the
Adamson law cases today agreed
to request that the Santa Fe case
scheduled to come up in the ,U. 3.
district court In Kansas City,
Kas., be postponed until tomorrow.
The conference, It was stated
authoritatively, was as to whether
the record of the case of Missouri,
Oklahoma A Gulf, appealed to the
supreme court yesterday, could be
made to cover the problems of all
railroads or whether one or two
additional test cases should be
brought.
Judge Pollock agreed to the
postponement.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 23—The
railroad view of what is the matter
with the country's transportation facil
ities was presented to the Joint con
gressional investigating committee to
day by Alfred P. Thorn, counsel for the
railroad executives' advisory commit
tee. Mr. Thom, chosen as first spokes
man for the roads when the committee
decided to begin fts
inquiry
by hear­
ing their side of the case, blamed the
present system of "corrective" regu
lation, divided between the state and
federal governments for most of the
problems troubling the public and the
carriers, and appealed for a discussion
I of necessary changes "not upon any
mere theory or jealousy as to the dis
I tribution of governmental power, but
upon the large Issue of what public in
terest requires."
Rates, Mr. Thom declared, are less
Important to public interest than "cer
tainty, safety and-'suffldency of trans
portation.' Under present conditions
in which "the railroad business is
(largely controlled by political instead
of business considerations," he added,
"railroad credit is so poor and returns
so small that adequate extension of
lines into undeveloped territory and
enlargement of facilities are impos
sible."
4 EXPECT NEW DECI8ION.
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 23.—Wheth
er or not the constitutionality of the
Adamson eight hour law is to be test
ed in a single case expedited to the
supreme court of the United States
was expected to l^e indicated here to
day in the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe railway's injunction suit against
the law, which was set for hearing in
the United States district court in
Kansas City, Kas.
Judge Hook's decision yesterday
in the Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf suit,
holding that the law is unconstitu
tional and allowing the government an
Immediate appeal, did not affect prepa
rations for hearing the Santa Fe's ac
tion today.
Attorneys for leading railroads who
are here to witness the proceedings
pointed out informally that the opera
tion of the law varied in its effect on
different railroad systems, according
to extent and local conditions and
said that close study would be requir
ed to determine whether one case
would develop the points affecting all
railroads.
A difference in the case heard yes
terday and the one today was that the
Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf is in the
hands of receivers under the direction
of the federal court, while the Santa
B*e is an independent agent
Walker D. Hines of New York, gen
eral counsel of the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe railroad and Gardiner
Lathrop of Chicago, general solicitor
of the road, arrived here this morn
ing aftid went into conference with
Frank Hagerman, special counsel for
the government, and other attorneys
Interested in the injunction suit
brought by the Santa Fe against the
Adamson law.
Judge Pollock said that the pro
ceedings in his court would await the
outcome of this conference.
INJUNCTIONS DENIED.
Chicago, Nov. 23.—Two railroad
companies today sought an immediate
injunction to restrain its employes
and the federal government from en
forcing the Adamson law but the mo
tion was denied by Federal Judge
George A. Carpenter to whom it was
presented in the absence of Federal
Judge Landis. The cases were set for
hearing December 4 with the other
railroad injunction suits against the
Adamson law. The companies who
made the demand for Immediate issu
ance of injunctions today were the
Pennsylvania comuany and the Pitts-1

COMPLICATIONS IN
SIGHT IS NEW FEAR
ACTIVITIES OF GERMAN SUBMA
RINES MAY CAUSE FRESH
TROUBLE.
Berlin. Tuesday, Nov. 21, (by wire
less to The Associated Press via Say
ville, N. Y., Nov. 23.)—A period of
complications may again be Impending
in German-American relations. Ger
many's conduct of submarine warfare
has brought forth an abundant crop of
American inquiries of which Joseph C.
Grew, the American charge, recently
has filed no less than ten—five of them
today. Six remain to .be answered in
cluding the cases of the Marina on
which a number of Americans appear
to have been killed, and the liner Ara
bia. the sinking of which the American
government declares appears to be in
consistent with the promises of the
German government regarding the
treatment of passenger liners.
The United States bases its attitude
in the case of the Arabic on the as
sumption that it was unarmed and tor
pedoed without warning and is unable
to see that there was adequate justifi
cation for forcing the passengers in
to the boats. Washington believes the
submarine commander, on ascertain
ing that there were women and chil
dren on the decks, should have re
frained from making an attack.
Germany in the four cases in regard
to which replies already have been
made was found to have fairly con
vincing answers, which it is believed
may put quite a different aspect on at-\
fairs. It is pointed out here for ex
ample, that according to testimony o(
her own passengers the Arabia was
armed and used her cannon that the
sea was smooth and that other vessels
were near. It is argued that the Ara
bia, having on board a large number
of coolie war workers, should be re
garded as a transport
U. S. OFFICIALS INTERESTED.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 23.—The
wording of the Berlin dispatch that "a
period of complications may be im
pending in German-American rela
tions" aroused much interest in official
circles, especially as the dispatch was
allowied to pass a very strict censor
ship.
Officials refused to disclose details
of the Inquiries sent to Berlin on tho
ground that they were only inquiries
for fact and would have a very bad
efTect on public opinion if an alarm
were given, only to be shown ground
less.

London, Nov. 23. —The Poles of
Austrian Silesia have declared against
a grant of autonomy to Galicia, accord

way of Amsterdam.
JACK LONDON DIES
Noted Author Passes Away Suddenly
While Apparently In Good Health
Friends Shocked.
Santa Rosa, Cal., Nov. 23.—Only the
Immediate relatives and intimate
friends of Jack London, who died last
night at his Glen Ellen stock farm,
near here, were permitted today to
view the body of the man v. ho was
California's best known contemporan
eous author, pending completion of ar
rangements for the funeral. London
will be buried in Oakland, in the fam
ily plot, probably Friday. The cere
mony probably will be private, the de
ceased author having expressed such
a wish.
London complained of indigestion
when he went to bed Tuesday night,
but notwithstanding during his last
conscious hours, sat up in bed writing.
His physicians attributed death to "a
gastro-intestlnal type of uremia."
Besides his widow, the Charmion of
his books, he is survived by two
daughters by his first wife, Joan and
Bess, the oldest of whom is seven
teen a sister Mrs. Eliza Shepcrd, and
his mother.
The news of London's death was
broken last night to the first Mrs. Lon
don, who lives In Oakland. She de
clared that the news staggered heiMr
that he had so much before him.
Glenellen, Cal., Nov. 23.—The body
of Jack London will be cremated In
Oakland tomorrow at noon. Only near
relatives will be present.
WIRE THIEF DIES
Roughly Clad 8tranger Is Found Elec
trocuted Had Cut High Power
Conveyers.
Burlington, Nov. 23. —The body of a
shabbily dressed stranger was found
in an outlying portion of the city last
night. Lying beside the body was a
pair of wire clippers, with a red hand
kerchief wrapped around the handle,
evidently for purposes of Insulation.
Two six-thousand volt electric light
wires dangled from a nearby pole,
where they had been released from
their insulators. The insulation on one
of the wires was mutilated Indicating
that the dead man after dropping the
wires had attempted to cut one of
them.
Many pounds of wire have been
stolen from the People's Gas & Elec
tric company recently and It is
thought that the man whose body was
found this morning was the author of
the thefts.
The stranger apparently was thirty
years of age. There was nothing about
him to indicate his identity. A Toledo,
Ohio, newspaper was found in his
pockets JOrd his rough clothing bore
the name of a Canton, 111,, clothier. He
evidently was a tramp.f.-'v*

ON THE THRONE
Announces Intent to Carry
on the War and Other
Policies of Nation-
London,(Nov. 23. —Emperor Charles
of Austria has issued a proclamation
to the Austro-Hungarians declaring his
inflexible decision to maintain the war
until a peace assuring the existence
and development of the monarchy," ac
cording to a Vienna dispatch to Reut
ers by way of Amsterdam. The dis
patch says the proclamation was print
ed in a special edition of the Wiener
Zeitung, together with an autograph
letter addressed to Premier Koerber.
The letter announced that the new
monarch has taken over the govern
ment and confirmed the premier in hia
present function. After paying homage
to the late emperor, the proclamation
paid
"I will continue to complete his
work. I asfcend his throne in a stormy
time. Our aim has not yet been achiev
ed and the illusion of the enemy to
throw down my monarchy and our al
lies is not yet broken. You know me
to be in harmony with my peoples in
my inflexible decision to continue the
struggle until a peace assuring the ex
istance and development of the mon
archy is obtained. I will do all in my
power to banish as soon as possible
the horrors and sacrifices of war and
to re-obtain peace as soon as the hon
or of our arms, the conditions of life
of my countries and their allies and
the defense of our enemies will allow."
BRITISH COMMENT.
London, Nov. 23. —The editorials in
the morning newspapers today concur
in the view that the death of Emperor
Francis Joseph and the accession of a
new monarch will not materially affect
the course of the war.
"The future of Austria-Hungary,"
says the Morning Post, "was never
darker or more forboding. Whatever
the outcome of the war she stands to
lose. Even If the Central powers avoid
a decisive defeat she will remain a
vassal of Germany, in fact, if not in
name."
Although Emperor Francis Joseph Is
recognized by the editorial writers to
have been personally friendly to Great
Britain and the tragedies of his reign
are sympathetically recalled, today's
estimates of his achievements and his
personality are not flattering.
BERLIN PAPERS MOURN.
Berlin, via London, Nov. 23 —All the
Berlin newspapers appear with mourn
ing borders today in respect to the
memory of Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria and print eulogistic articles
on the late monarch.
GERMANS MEETING
GREAT DIFFICULTIES
Berlin, Nov. 23.—(By wireless to
Sayville)—The difficulties of cam
painglng in mountainous districts on
the Rumanian-Transylvanian border
through Which the Austro-German
armies have been pushing in their in
vasion of Rumania are depicted today
in an Overseas News agency review of
the recent fighting. Recently bitter
cold has prevailed in the hill regions,
where the fighting zone at some points
has been at an elevation as great as
7,500 feet, and the narrow pass roads
have been blocked with snow and ice.
At certain places where the invading
columns were advancing there was
but one such road available for the
troops and all the heavy equipment of
artillery and supplies needed to press
the offensive, with only carts and auto
mobiles as a means of transportation.
Despite these difficulties and the
tenacious resistance of the Rumanians
who are declared in the review to have
been aided by civilians in guerilla war
fare, the AuBtro-German armies
stormed height after height and stead
ily forced their way forward. In
eight days General von Falkenhayn's
forces striking down towards Craiova
advanced no less than fifty-five miles.
BULGARS CLAIM
FOE HAS STOPPED
Sofia, Nov. 23 (Via London)—At
tempts of entente forces to develop
their success on the Macedonian front
by advancing north of Monastir have
failed, it is announced by the war of
fice.
"Between Lake Ochrida and Lake
Presba," the statement says, "there
were engagements with advanced
guards of the enemy's infantry push
ing forward north of Monastir. which
were repulsed. In the Cerna bend all
the desperate attacks of the enemy on
Hill 1050 east of Paralovo were broken
by the determined resistance of the
German chausseur guard.
"Artillery and infantry firing occur
red at some places along the Danube.
The Rumanians sank their Herges on
trie Danube and destroyed the bridge
near Cornbla, where they set fire'to
stores of ammunition."
DUTCH STEAMER

London, Nov. 23.—The Dutch steam
er Helina from Rotterdam for New
York In ballast has been sunk by
mines in the North sea, according to
a dispatch from Hull today to the Cen

No Dutch steamer Heltna is listed
in available shipping records. There
are two Dutch steamers Helena, one
of 1.798 tons gross and the other 1,146
gross tons. The former was last re

HUGHES CONCEDES
ELECTION OF RIVAL
PRESIDENT WIL80N TELEGRAPH8
A REPLY WISHING OPPONENT
WELL.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 23.—Presi
dent Wilson today sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes acknowledging his
message of congratulation received
last night.
The president's telegram said:
"I am sincerely obliged to yon for
your message of congratulation. Al
low me to assure yo4i of my good
wishes for the years to come."
In his telegram Mr. Hughes said:
"Because of the closeness of the vote
I have awaited the official count in
California, and now, that it has been
virtually completed, permit me to ex
tend you my congratulations upon
your reelection. I desire also to ex
press my best wishes for a successful
administration."
After the president had telegraphed
to Mr. Hughes the white house made
public several thousand telegrams of
congratulation from cabinet members,
governors of states, democratic lead
ers in practically every state and pres
idents of several Latin-American re
publics.
No messages were received from
any of the belligerent nations.
Replying to the congratulations of
the cabinet the president said:
"One of the best things abont the
result is that it means four more
years of active association in public
service and in that we are genuinely
rejoiced."
This was taken by some to forecast
an invitation from the president to the
members of the cabinet to remain in
office.
STATEMENT BY WILLCOX.
New York, Nov. 22.—William R.
Willcox, chairman of the republican
national committee, last night issued
the following statement:
'Having conferred by telephone dur
ing the day and late this afternoon
with the republican state committee
and the republican national commit
teeman In California, I am informed
that the official canvass of the vote
has been so nearly completed that no
change will result from the few pre
cincts not counted in the returns thus
far compiled.
"This means that the majority for
the Wilson electors in California
ranges from about 1,200 to 3,800 votep,
and that is the final result of the can
vass for which we have been waiting.
So far as any recount is concerned, the
national committee is not advised that
there are sufficient grounds to call for
such an application.''
NEW YORK BETS PAID.
Holders of some of the largest wag
ers made In Wall street on the presi
dential election began paying the bets
off tod$y on the assumption that there
now was no doubt President Wilson
bad been elected.
Estimates of the total sum wagered
in the financial district range from $3,
000,000 to 15.000,000. Probably half
was paid within a week after election,
but the balance was held by stake
holders pending a final agreement be
tween bettors. It was said, however,
there still remained a few who placed
money on Hughes who insist their bets
be not paid until President Wilson's
election is officially conceded.
War Summary
Latest reports of the vigorous
campaign General von Falkerihayn
Is waging against the Rumanians
indicate that the Teutonic forces
are overrunning western Walla
chia, following up sharply their
defeat of the Rumanians In the
Jiul valley region and the capture
of Craiova.
Berlin has reported progress for
the Austro-German armies that
are extending the Teutonic front
westward from the Jiul region to
wards Orsova. The fate of the
Rumanian army that was operat
ing in the Orsova region yet re
mains in doubt, as does the extent
to whleh the Russo-Rumanlan
forces In the Jiul valley were able
to withstand the swift southward
thrust of Von Falkenhayn's troops.
Indications of the abandonment
by the Rumanians of a large sec
tion of western Wallachla may be
found in today's announcement by
the Bulgarian war office. It re
ports the destruction by Rumanian
forces of the bridge over the Dan
ube near Corabla. fifty miles south
east of Craiova, the firing of stores
of ammunition there and the sink
ing by the Rumanians of their
barges in the Danube, presumably
In the region indicated.
So far it appears that the en
tente forces which captured Mon
astir have not been able to press
their advance beyond the new line
taken up by the Bulgarians and
Germans a short distance north of
the city. Sofia records the repulse
of entente attacks in the bend of
the Cerna and further eastward
and the stopping of advance gnarda
which were pushing forward in
the regions of Lakes Presba and
Ochrida to the west.
Only artillery and aviation oper
ations along the Somme In north
ern France and elsewhere on the
Franco-Belgian front are report
ed in todny's bulletins from Lon
don and Paris.
The British admiralty today
confirmed press advices that there
were no wounded on board the
British hospital ship Britannic
when she was sunk In the Agean.
Those on the vessel were her
crew and the hospital staff.

OTTUMWA, IOWA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1916 NUMBER
I
Eddyville People Feel That
River May Cut a New
Channel There
A matter which may come before
the supervisors of Wapello and Mon
roe county soon is that of protecting
the Des Moines river bridge at Eddy
ville from a possible change in the
current of the stream.
Many persons in Eddyville feel that
should the new channel be cut across
the Bridgeport bottom it would neces
sitate the building of a new wagon
and railroad bridge in Monroe county
or an immense amount of reconstruc
tion work and diking to force the riv
er back into the old channel with a
more imminent hazard of its recur
rence at every future high water.
Laymen, discussing the matter frota
the river's bank, advise that one or
more substantial wing dams or bar
rages should be constructed below
the mouth of Gray's creek to deflect
the current back into the old channel
and to cut out the accumulated sand
and debris. They feel that it should
be done this fall to head off any pos
sible danger from the effects of the
spring freshets.
Eddyville people are strong in their
convictions that unless something is
done, and done at once, the next high
water may tear a new channel Aross
the bottom and leave the bridge stand
ing inactive and the town an inland
place.

U.S.MEDIAT0RS ARE

GOING TO MEET MEXICANS HALF
WAY IN EFFORT TO COMPOSE
DIFFICULTIES.
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 23.—When
the Mexican-American joint commis
sion convened today it appeared evi
dent that the Americans were willing
to meet the Mexicans half way in so
phrasing the proposals made Tuesday
that the Mexicans would feel Justified
in agreeing to them.
It has been Indicated that the Amer
icans were content to have eliminated
from the official document reference
to the right of the American govern
ment to send troops into Mexico. It
was understood that the chief objec
tion of the Mexicans was to such pro
vision. With that feature eliminated
there would remain little more than
the agreement for the withdrawal of
American troops now in Mexico and
the provision that the armies of the
two countries should guard their re
spective frontiers.
BATTLE JN MEXICO
Report Says That Villa has Com
menced His Long Expected Attack
Upon Chihuahua.
fel Paso, Tex., Nov. 23.—Francisco
Villa began an attack on Chihuahua
City at 11 o'clock today, a message re
ceived by Carranza officials in Juarez
at noon today stated. Villa is making
his attack from the south, the mes
sage stated.
General Murgia, who was reported
to have reached Mapula. about twelve
miles south of Chihuahua City, is ex
pected to attack Villa from the rear
according to this information. Gen
eral Trevino is in command of the
forces which are defending the capi
tal of the state and has approximately
5,000 men with artillery and strong
fortifications surrounding the town to
the west and south, the Carranza offi
cers in Juarez declare.
An attack upon the state capital by
Villa bandits has been expected since
yesterday as Villa was reported to
have reached Horcasitas, about thirty
miles south of Chihuahua City, yester
day with his main column.
Ammunition from the Juarez arsenal
was rushed to Chihuahua City yester
day on a special train to be issued to
General Trevino's troops.
Carranza officials here and in Juarez
are authority for the statement that
General Trevino intends to defend the
city against any bandit attack as long
as his ammunition lasts. The fact that
the telegraph line is open from Juarez
to Chihuahua City indicates the con
centration of Villa's forces to the
south ot Chihuahua City as it Is cus
tom to cut telegraph communication
as soon as he begins an attack upon
a town and his men would have cut
the wires to Juarez if there were ban
dits north of the capital.

Study Grocery Business.
There is a new feature being
out in the seventh grade under the^
directions of Superintendent Blaek^J
mar which is somewhat novel but
sesses much of the practical. The
youngsters in this grade in all of the?l
local schools have been studi
grocery business. Thus fa^WI^
pupils of the Adams school have
in their papers and the others are
pected daily. The results of this
of study will be watched with lnte
by both superintendent and teachers.
The pupils have taken to it with ft
degree of seriousness that in SOBM/I
cases amused, in others gave posslMs|.
annoyance to some of the dealers
of whom they asked questions. Child:.
like, some of these questions
perhaps somewhat direct bat fhetj
school authorities beg the merclwptvj
to be patient with the youngsters 'In
the study of theqe subjects for
purpose is to get a better undent
ing between the fellow behind t!
counter and his neighbor or cnstOBB
on the outside of the counter.
Fallowing the study of grocery b«
iness some trade will' be studied and
then perhaps another branch pf baa
lness. After that perhaps a profts—
sion, manufacturing, etc., and thns the£
seventh grader will be given a new?
line of study not common in the class:
room yet fitting him or her better In
the work of life after he or she leaves
school. Superintendent Blackmar, the
principals and teachers, in the various
schools, are watching closely the r»
suit cf the experipent In the niV
study to determine Its worth.
