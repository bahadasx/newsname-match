WASHINGTON. Nov. 23 Confer
ences between Attorney General Greg
ory and counsel for important railway
3ystems of the country, looking to the
expedition to the supreme court of
one of the suits attacking the constitu
tlonality of the Adamson act, virtual
ly were concluded today and the ques
tion of which shall be made the test
case was placed in the bands of de
partment of justice attorneys and le
gal representatives of the railways
now in Kansas City.
It was said tonight that in the con
ference here the form of the agree
ment between the attorney general
and the railway lawyers was In sub
stance decided upon, and that the on
ly matter to be determined in Kan-,
ecs City is whether the suit of the'
Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway
decided yesterday against the govern
ment or that of the Santa Fe, set for
hearing tomorrow should be made the
test case. Terms of the tentative un
derstanding were telegraphed by the
department to G. C. Todd, assistant to
the attorney general in charge of anti-trust
prosecutions, now aiding in
handling the Kansas City cases and
by counsel for the carriers ta Walker
D. Hines. counsel for the Santa Fe.
In substance the plans provide that
both the department and the railways
agree in every way to expedite anfl
actively press the case to be deter
mined upon in a final decision in the
supreme 6ourt and that during the
pendency of these suits, the govern
ment will not begin any prosecutions
of carriers for failure to apply the
law. During its pendency the carri
ers will institute no more suits, and
at its determination no parties to the
agreement will be bound by the su
preme court decision, the carriers
agreeing not to bring such actions if
the law is found constitutional and to
drop all others. Neither party is
bound by the agreement to refrain
from efforts to obtain legislation that
n.ight change the Adamson act.
It was explained tonight that the
question of choosing a test case had
been put in the hands of the attorneys
in Kansas City because of the lack of
sufficient information to warrant an
agreement. It developed that when
the attorney general asked railroad
representatives last night if they
were willing to make the test on the
Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf case
they answered that they knew about
that and could not say that it would
cover all the ground that should be
covered. They were confident, how
ever, that the bill of the Santa Fe,
with which they were familiar, was
sufficiently broad to make a typical

Paris Pays Hearty

A id From A merica
Sorbonne Is Scene of Most
Brilliant- Assemblage of
French Notables Since Col.
Roosevelt's Appearance.
(By Lawrence Dean Clark)
PARIS, Nov. 23. The great amphi
theatre of the Sorbonne had not been
so crowded since Theodore Roosevelt
spoke there several years ago as it j
was today when a brilliant assem
blage of French men and women as
sembled to give evidence of their rec
ognition of what Americans have done
for France.
The audience, which was composed
of those who had assembled by invita
tion, was largely of persons of dis
tinction. The stage was occupied by
members of the French Academy, the
official representatives of President
Poincaire, members of the cabinet,
many ladies, and officers in uniforms.
When the band of the Republican ,
Guard played the Star Spangled Ban-!
ner the entire audience arose and re
mained standing until the American j
national anthem was finished. Then
rousing cheers were given for the
United States.
The reading of telegrams of salu
tation from Americans was greeted
with applause as also were references
to the individual cases of devotion
and sacrifice made by Americans.
After the more formal part of the
program had been carried out a poem
by Walt Whitman was read. Another
poem, entitled "To Our Friends in
America" which was written for the
occasion, also was read.
Replying to the remarks of M. Mil-
Wand and Prof. Bputroux, the Ameri-
can ambassador, Wm. G. Sharpe, ex-; lence on the part of the state depart

CHICAGO. Nov. 23. Two masked
men held up the messenger on an ex
press car on the Chicago and North
western Railway train No. 50S after
it left Barrlngton, Ills., tonight, and
in the thirty minutes run to Chicago,
rifled the safe of cash estimated at
$1,000, selected what valuables they
wanted from the packages and drop
ped off the train when it reached Cly
bourn Junction, a switching stop in
the heart of this city.
The train crew found the messen
ger, W. E. Carter, strapped to his
chair gagged and half conscious. The
holdups had strewn the floor of the
car with checks and securities and
vasion, but more particularly on ac
count of the activity of legalista Jun-
tas in Arizona. An invasion of Sono-j
ra by members of this party, with the '
ultimate Intention of capturing Cana
nea. is said to have been thwarted by
bringing the troops northward.
General Sobarzo's scouts along the
Chihuahua border have been unable j
up to this time to locate any Villistas
or discover any signs of a Vlllista :

(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Nov. 23. "It is for Hin
denburg to sum up whether the gains
of the German army in Rumania pay
for the loss sustained on the other
fronts by the withdrawal of divisions
to operate there," said Major General
F. B. Maurice, chief director of mili-
tary operations of the war office in
discussing today with an Associated
Press correspondent the latest mili
tary developments.
"'t is impossible and foolish to pro
phesy the outcome of the German
campaign in Rumania," continued
General Maurice, "but I can say the

first efforts to cut through by way of

Since that time, the Germans have
had to go a long way around, thereby
giving the Rumanians time, which
they need.

BERLIN. Nov. 23. The Overseas
News Agency sends out the following
statement regarding the battle in Ru
mania: "Since Craiova was conquered, the
German and Austro-Hungarian troops
dominate the situation in the western
part of Rumania, the so-called small
Wallnchla. The Rumanians tried to
Impede the advance into this part of
the Wallachia plains by all means,
which is proved by the great efforts
they made at the Orsavo.
"All these desperate efforts, how
ever, were unable to divert the fate of
western Wallachia. On the 21st the
German troops entered Cralvoa itself.
"This means the conquest of 11.000
square kilometers of fertile wheat soil
The occupation of Craivoa is also of
high strategical importance. A net
work of roads radiates from Cralvoa
which is all the more important since
strategically the most important rail
road between Rothentliurm pass find
the Danube, running north and south,
is distant only forty kilometers."

WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.
President Wilson's annual mes-

I that the reports of the several

are not discussed.
The President emphasizes the
incomplete legislation on rail-

' pressing problem facing Con-
gress. He .then goes on to a gen-

JUAREZ. Nov. 23. Three times to
day Francisco Villa attacked the first
line trenches which defend Chihua
hua City and three times he was re
pulsed, leaving his dead and wound
ed on the plains outside of the city
to the south, according to military
despatches received at the Co-an-dancia
Militar here from the besieged
city, by General Francisco Gonzales.
At 11 o'clock a. m. today (mountain

bandits were seen to be south, along
tbe Mexican Central line, according
to these messages. The battle opened
a - few minutes later with, a
salvo of cannon shots from Santa Ro

The first and second line trenches,
protected by barbed wire entangle

this reason the twenty or more pieces
