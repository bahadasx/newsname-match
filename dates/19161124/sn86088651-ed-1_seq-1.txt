This it a hurried world. Yet we linger long over interest
ing things, and wish to linger longer.
We like brief sermons, but not brief plays.
We want our sweetmeats in bulky form, but our quini- e
in a capsule.
All this applies to advertising.
Tell an interesting story to an interested man and brevity
becomes a fault
For instance, a motor enthusiast, about to spend a year's
savings on a car. You can't say too much to him.
"Reason Why" a Lord A Thomas copy idea has had
a thousand critics. But look at its successes.
This all depends on the ad.

better stop talking entirely.
If you are talking bombast, brevity is much to be desired.
If your treatment Isn't interesting, length is an added
fault.
But don't omit things worth snying. None of your readers
is seeking amusement Unless they want information
they'll pass the briefest ad by.
Don't skimp them on what they want
