ing to these messages. The battle
was oncned a few minutes later with
a s:ilvo from cannon on Saita Rosa
Hill, the key to the state capital. The

nt !et:st 3.500 men, nearly all of whom
arr armed and mounted. He is also

TREVINO HOLDS THE
KEY TO CHIHUAHUA CITY
Has
Fortified Santa Rosa Hill
Seven Large Cannon.
Witl
El Paso, Texas, Nov. 23. Santa Rosa
Hill, an eminenece 600 feet high, which
is located about one mile from the
plaza in Chihuahua City, is the key
to the state capital and northern Mex
ico, prominent American refugees from
Chihuahua City declare.
It was in tne vieniii of the hill that
Villa and hi3 forces attacked Chihua
hua City early in November, 1913. He
was driven off by General Salvador
Mercado's artillery and then Villa en
circled Chihuahua City, attacked and
took Juarez on November 15 of the
same year.
This hill is an elevation between
mountains, the American refugees
say, and must be taken before an en
trance can be made into the city. On
this hill General Trevino has mounted
seven large calibre cannon, according
to the Americans and had further for
tified it with machine guns and barbed
wire entanglements.
The refugees believe a greater part
of the fighting today occurred in the
vicinity of Colonia Dale, a British set
tlement to the southwest of Chihuahua
City. To attack the forces in the Vi
cinity of this natural fortification
from the south, the bandits would
have to cross an. open plain, the
Americans familiary with the locality
say. It was here that the heavy losses
in the Villa forces are believed to
have occurred.

pelling the government to affirm the
constitution ility of the law?"

out. We will resist to the uttermost.'
Jurisdictional disputes took up most'
