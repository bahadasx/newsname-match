INCREASE FARM VALUES
Review of Livestock and Crop Condi
tions In Lemhi County by Newton
H ibbs.
The farmers of Lemhi county are
holding more stock over winter than
ever before. Practically no stock is
being led for butchering, but all herds
have been increased by holding breed
ing and young stock. The hay crop
was better than normal, but the in
ei eased holdings have advanced the
price of hay over the average for five
yeaps almost 100 per cent.
There was no damage in this coun
try from early fall freezing. The po
tato crop was about normal, but the
outside demand has left a shortage
for home demand. There are not po^
latoes enough in the county to meet
the demand for food and seed. The
price nas advanced to »3 a hundred.
The limited supply is controlled by
ihe speculators. Not more than 10
per cent of supply that may be distri
buted later is in the hands of the
growers. The quality of the potato
crop was good.
Woven wire fences are being built
almos exclusively. Sheep are being
distributed among the farmers to be
ranged in enclosures. Hogs are near
ly all sold for shipment.
Grain is high with a local demand
for all the surplus on the farms at a
price above that of the market cen
ters. Some grain has been shipped
.nto the county from Montana. The
extensive stock ranges have brought
such large numbers of sheep to this
county to be fed through the winter
I hat grain crops are being sacrificed
for hay crops to carry' the sheep
through the winter. There is range
for more than can be fed from the re
turns front the present meadow' area.
Many farms are changing ownership
on account of the demand for head
quarters for the flockmasters. The
extensive ranges on the national for
ests have made good stock farms very
valuable. The owners of farms in the
valley are favored with permits
which control the summer ranges.
WOMAN'S FRATERNAL ORDER
HONORS GRAND MATRON HERE
Hugn Duncan chapter. No. 2, O. E.
■>., held a special meeting last Tues
day evening in honor of the Grand
Matron of Idaho, Mrs. Stella H. Van
Riper. After a brief talk on ritualistic
work Mrs. Van Riper gave an enter
taining report of the Grand Chapter
meeting in Louisville, Ky., in October
from which session she is just retura
ng. At a banquet after the ceremo
nies of the order Mrs. Van Riper in an
informal talk commended this chap
ter upon their donation to the fund
for an O. E. S. Home. Mrs. McCaleb
was the only charter member present.
Grandma Yearian and Mrs. Thomas
Yarian of Lemhi wer- 1 present be
side a large gathering of the Salmon
members. Dr. Whitwell presented for
the chapter to Mrs. Van Riper a
beautiful silver souvenir spoon.
MR. KIRKPATRICK APPOINTED.
O. E. Kirkpatrick came over from
Leesburg on Wednesday to spend the
week in Salmon. This is his first visit
since his gun shot accident last sum
mer, but he has entirely recovered
and is now himself again. At Lees
burg as well as in all the other inter
mountain country winter set in early,
with zero temperatures prevailing
much of the time since the first week
in November.
Mr. Kirkpatrick was appointed some
time ago by Governor Alexander a
delegate to the American Mining Con
gress at Chicago. Mr. Kirkpatrick
tells The Recorder that the congress
was organized 19 years ago and that
it has originated many valuable ideas
which have resulted for the progress
of the mining industry.
Safety First a Success.
A table recounting the fatalities to
employees occurring annually on the
t iregon Short Line since the Safety
First propaganda was begun shows
the number has decreased from eight i
teen in 1913 to four for the fiscal year!
•-nding June 30. 1916. j
It is a splendid record of achieve-1
ment, a decrease of 75 per cent in j
fatalities to the railroad s own men
worth whatever of effort, of lime, and j
of money it has cost. To it both offli (
ers and employees must have contrib
uted with that hearty spirit of effic-k,
ient co-operation which, even the ver
_ , I
iest tvro in transportation affairs can
J I, .w
perceive, animates all the depart
K ...
inents of that railroad.
To the patrons of the Oregon Snort,
Line, this successful solicitude for (
the safety of employees may seem less
interesting than data as to precau-,
lions Tor passengers But If should be
obvious that in guarding ita own men
the railroad is also protecting its
passengers to the best of Its ability. (
JOHN E. MULLEN IS A
WORKING MINING MAN
John E. Mullen has closed his
Moose creek dredge for the winter af
ter another successful season. The
told weather came a month sooner
lhan usual. Until next May. when
the dredge starts up again, Mr Mullen
w ill be engaged In mining coal from
his own property, which is taken out
and delivered at the dredge at an
expense or 22 per ton. For the year
now closed he used 600 tons of this
coal which proved to be a go-getter as
a steam producer.
\\ ood fuel used heretofore cost as
much with less satisfactory results.
Mr. Mullen is well pleased with tbe
business outlook and regards Salmon
a* entering upon the period of last
ing and permanent prosperity. Be
ing a practical worker and producer of
wealth himself he finds conditions en
tirely satisfactory and expects Salmon
to take a place of more and more im
portance right along.
Spring Mountain Mines.
The Winnie Mine, which is owned
by the Excelsior Mining Co. (as the
Wood Livestock Co.) and was leased
during the early part of the summer
to J. K. Robinson, Ned Boomer, W. M
Snow and Robert Tweely, all residents
of Gilmore, Idaho, and who shipped
several carloads of ore during the
summer and then closed down about
Ih* 20th of August. The mine then
was dormant until the 11th of Sep
u mber, when J. K. Robinson and
Frank Howe took over the lease and
Mr Howe states that he intends to
ship several cars of high grade lead
ore during the life of the lease. The
lion Mask mine, owned by P. H.
Clarke and associates, have shipped
one car of lead ore and were well
pleased with Returns. This property
is now. about readyto release another
car to the smelters at Salt Lake. P.
11. Clarke Sons are now planning to
operate a copper mine in which they
are interested, during the winter, by
sinking a shaft on the vein and ship
ping the ore that is taken out to Ana
conda for treatment.
Jack White and associates, who
have a lease on the Russell, Teddy,
and Elizabeth, (commonly known as
the Big Windy hill) have encountered
a large vein of lead ore of which its
quai is unknown in this section of
the county for value in lead. The
vein is at present 7 feet wide and the
hanging wall has yet to be located, the
.in is above and below themand it is
quite difficult to ascertain the amount
of ore they have in actual tonnage
in sight. Those mines are owned by
C. H. Oakley, T I). Ellis Min. foul
son, Joe Jugivich and Bert Ethier
During the summer of 1908 and 1909
the Lemhi Smelting Co who built a
smelter at Hahn, had a lease on those
mines, and during the life of the lease
shipped to their own plant about 1800
tons of 20 per cent lead ore, but for
tunately, for Mr. White failed to dis
cover this remarkable treasure. The
Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Co.
own several claims adjacent to and
below the Teddy group and have been
driving a tunnel to cross-cut the for
mation and intercept a vein that is out
< ropped on one of their claims known
as the Red Bird. This property has
an excellent showing of ideal smelting
ore and it is understood that they now
have a small shipment of this ore as
a trial to assure themselves of its
value. When they have completed
the tunnel it will tap the Windy Hill
at a depth of 1400 to 1600 feet perpen
dicularly. This tunnel has encounter
ed five fissures and in one of tbe flu
sures the vein is now about four feet
wide with a gross value of about $3n
per ton The company is now contem
plating to drift on the vien and open
it so as to begin shipping There are

GROWING GRAIN ON SOUTH
ERN IDAHO DRY FARMS.
Washington, U. C.. Nov. 20.—With
the object of supplying settlers with
reliable information which will en
able them to make homes on the dry
(arms as quickly and at as little ex
lieuse as possible, the v. S l>epart
tneni of Agriculture has )u»t publish
ed Farniers'Bullentin 7rt9. "Growing
Grain on Southern Idaho Dry Farms."
The author of the bulletin, L. C Amb
er, assistant agronomist in IheBureau
of Plant Industry, discusses in detail
I he soil, climate and conditions on
tbe Snake river plains of southern
Idaho and the dry-farmed valleys op
ening into this great basin, the section
to which the publication applies.
Several page* are devoted to a dis
cussion of the proper dry-farming ma
chinery and its use. The remainder
of the bulletin deals with selection
and treatment of seed, and seed-bed
preparation, and rocommenda the va
rieties of spring and winter wheat,
oats, barley, enimer, spelt, rye and
fiax found best adapted to the dis
trict. The author after discussing va
rieties gives definite directions as to
time of sowing and methods of hand
ling the different varieties to attain
ihe best results.
Of the general soil situai Ion in this
district, he states:
"Humus and nitrogen are lacking
more or less in the southern Idaho
soils. The dry farmer on the plains
is handicapped because of lack of suf
ficient moisture in the soil to rot any
great .quantity of vegetable matter
Si raw, manure and legumes should be
used to help build up the dry land soils
but owing lo the light rainfall this
must be done very slowly.
"The dry-farm soils, if properly
laitiled, will yield good returns. If
a profitable rotation can be planned a
permanent dry-farm agriculture prac
tit-ally is assured."
Importance of Good Seed.
The author lays particular stress
on the importance of selecting and
treating seed, particularly wheat
On this subject he says:
Wheat growers and seedsmen often
claim that wheat 'runs out.' Some of
the best farmers in southern Idaho
ship in Turkey wheat from other lo
calities eeery three or four years be
cause they say their seed is running
•>ut. These growers think that yields
decrease and the percentage of yel
low berry increases each year the crop
is grown.
'This is not really the case. If
properly bandied, the quality of the
crop can be improved or at least
maintained as long as it is grown in a
community. The variety becomes
adapted to local climatic conditions
If the conditions are severe, only th«
best and most fit plants survive.
"The results of many experiments
prove conclusively that the source ol
«eed has nothing to do with the pro
ixirtion of yellow berry in the crop in
my year. It is proved also that de
creased yields need not result from
using home-grown seed. Other fac
tors are responsible for the low yields
Grading the Seed.
Grading the seed with a fanning
mill will do more to maintain yields
than the Introduction of new seed
Blow out all the chaff, straw, and
shrunken kernels. How only plump
seed, which contains plenty of food
to supply the sprouting plant until the
roots are able to obtain food from tbe
soil I'lump grain also is less injured
by the smut treatment and aiway«
germinates better than shrunken seed
Get a pure, high y ielding variety from
-our state experiment station or some
other reliable source and then take
good care of it.
Treating Wheat for Stinking Smut.
Ihe first essential for treating
wheat for bunt or stinking smut is to
(an the grain well, thus blowing out
all light material and any «mut balls
that may be preagnt. If smut balls
■
still are present put the wheat in a
barrel of water. They then come to
ihe surface and can be skimmed off
Tne aster is then drained out of the
barrel, and tbe seed resacked and
made ready for immediate treatment
in the smut destroying solution
The formaldehyde treatment for
stinking smut require* soaking the
grain about ten minute* m a solution
of 1 pint of commercial formaldehyde
to 45 gallons of water. The seed
should then be dumped in a pile. prof,
erably on a canvas, and covered for
two hour* This is done to distribute
-the formaldehyde gas throughout the
.. ..
pile and to prevent the escape of the
the seed then should be *pread
out thinly on a canvas, dried suffic
iently to sow in a drill, and put in
sacks which have been dipped in the
foimaldehyde solution The hopper
and tube* of tbe drill should also be
cleansed with the solution, in order to
, * 1 * treated seed free from smut,
i It is useless to traat seed and then

QOOD ^ASSOCIA
TION WILL CO-OPERATE WITH
OTHERS BEFORE LEGISLATURE
The decisive vote of bonds to the
amount of 6150.60«} for Lemhi county
roeds. or rather for the two main
highways that traverse this county, is
hailed as the moat advanced step ever
taken for progress in Central Idaho
Custer county is also in Ihe same pro

polls of a slmillar bond Issue of flUU.

These funds will all be expended
directly and indirectly u> the benefit
of Salmon, the main supply depot for

both counties together will expend a
luarter of a million of dollar* In road
making, an amount considerably larg
er will be appropriated in all likeli
hood by the stale and ftvderal gov
ernments largely on the same roads,
he appropriations by the state and
general gov et muent, indeed, depend
ing on and hanging upon these coun
ty bond issues.
Thus It is that Salmon people are
jubilant at the brightness of the out
l<sik for the city'* development and
growth. We should double tbe town's
population in the next year or two
The business stimulus from the proa
