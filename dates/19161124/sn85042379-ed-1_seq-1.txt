^ -r—.. . . •
The Glasgow F ire Department is
now a reality. After months of care- j
ful preparation, the organization has |
attained its membership, the new auto I
truck, hose cart and chemical appara- j
tus is on the way here, and the fire
hall is rapidly Hearing completion. j
Until now the system of fighting
fires in the city has been of an erratic
nature. While it has served the pur- j
pose and volunteers have responded ;
to every call, there has been a lack j
of system, and it was to remedy this, J
and to have trained men who could,
be depended upon to be the first to
answer the al arm, that the fire com- j
pany was organized. |
Early last spring, Dug Hall, who is j
chief of the Glasgow fire department, j
laid his plans to build up a model fire ;
lighting and property saving organi
zation. Many obstacles presented
themselves, but these have beeji over- ]
come, and with the cooperation of the
city council, the necessary apparatus
and equipment was purchased.
The big studeba^ei tiuc , em )o y .
ing hose cart and chemical in one was
shipped a week ago. It is expected to
arrive at any time and will be kept in
the fire hall. This new fire fighting
machine will be able to answer alarms
from any part of the city on short no
tice. I
The building formerly occupied by,
Wells Bros., adjoining the Coleman
Hardware Co.. has been remodeled and
will be the city fire station. Several
rooms are to be ntted up where sin-1
gle men belonging to the department
, . , , , ^
may sleep and be^ready to respond to
a call on the instant. An office will
also be arranged .there. !
It is compulsory for every member
of the department to answer every
call, and fines and penalties are lev-.
ied for those who fail to appear. !
The fire company has the support
of every business man in the city and
its members have been carefully se
lected. I
To raise funds for the company, a
dance will be given in the Gibson
Opera house on New \ ear s e\e and (
the committee in charge promise one
of the best dances and the bigge*t
time of the season. Tickets will soon
be placed on sale and whether you
dance, or not, you will be helping an j
organization that is deserving of sup
port by buying a ticket.
NOTED ORCHESTRA
COMPANY COMING
Crotian Tamburica Orchestra to Give
Concert at High School
On Monday evening, November
27th, the Croatian Tamburica Orches
tra will furnish the fourth entertain
ment of the High School course.
The tamburica is a peculiar native
instrument of the people of Croatia,
a province of Austria-Hungary. The
instrument is similar to a mandolin,
banjo and guitar, but different from
them all. It is to possess more life
fem a ». » .s to possess more me
and sweetness of tone than any of (
these !
The character of music played and '
sung by the company is varied, rang- j
from Balkan melodies to selections
from popular and standard operas. J
This entertainment promises to be a
real musical treat for the .Glasgow '
people and is worthy of liberal pat- j
ronage. The program will begin at
8:15. Tickets may be secured and
reservations made at the Glasgow
Drug Co. I

NEW PIANIST AT ORPHEUM
Patrons of the Orpheum Theatre t
have been commenting on the fine
musical accompaniment to the pic
tures the last few days. The reason j
is easily explained. Prof. Henry Al
len, formerly with the Orpheum the
atre at Williston, and more recently
with the "Civilization" orchestra, ar
rived here the other day to accept the
position at the local Orpheum.
Mr. Allen is an experienced band
and orchestra leader, and no doubt
will organize both here, and if he re_ !
ceives no support from the musically j
inclined, he will organize a juvenile 1

in a most astounding manner.
The census shows that there

and mercantile houses, not including
state and national banks real estate j
dealers or professional men. A
year ago there were according to the
i .
R. G. Dun & Co. census for 1915, only
10,971 mercantile establishments in
! Montana. In other words there has
been a gain of practically 1,000 mer
chants in the state in twelve months,
Most of these merchants are new peo
! pie in Montana. Such a gain is al
most unprecedented in any of the
northwestern states except in boom,
and while Montana has had a good

boom as that expression generally is
understood.

SOO MAY EXTEND ROAD
> There has been a persistent rumor
J ; n t h e north country the last few
weeks that the Soo line contemplated
extending its Ambrose branch from
j Whitetail west in the spring. The
rumor is strengthened by the fact
j that President Edmund Pennington of
I the Soo line, and a party of officials
have been in the north country
t specting conditions. The immense'
crops raised in the north country this
season has been a big inducement to
j get them to extend their line, and it is
claimed that the Soo officials gave as
surances that the new line would be
built in 1917. As the Great Northern
also contemplates tapping the terri
tory, it will be a merry race to see
who gets there first to haul next
year's crop to market.

Circumstances Strange
A double tragedy occurred at Froid
last week, when Gust Manos, known
in some places as Nick Paulos, killed
his young wife and then committed
suicide.
The affair has created more than
ordinary feeling in Sheridan county,
s the circumstances were unusual.

According to reports their married
life was not harmonious and Paulos,
fired by jealousy, comitted the double
murder.
BUY RED CROSS SEALS
A million Red Cross stamps will
probably be sold in Montana this sea
son, and Glasgow will no doubt be
one of the leading cities to contribute
to the fund which is used in the fight
against the great "White Plague."
All the money gained from the sale
of the stamps within the state, will
be kept here to be used in combatting
and suppressing tuberculosis.
Stamps are now on sale at all three
of the local drug stores and a booth
will probably be placed in the post
j office to aid in the sale. The Art
j Club has also made arrangements to
handIe a large quantity, on every

I the fight against tuberculosis.
AFTER RECRUITS
Sergeant John W. Spicer of the Re
cruiting Service of the U. S. Army,
has been in the city several days with
a view to obtain recruits.
He was detailed to come here from
the Spokane office to inspect a recruit
which the postmaster at Opheim had
written about, and on arriving in
Glasgow he found that the town is lo
cated 5;> miles from a railroad. The
government will pay transportation!
on the railroad, but not for auto liv
ery, so the Sergeant decided that;
while it might be good training to
walk the distance, that it would be

Sheridan County Authorities Issue
Warning to Farmers and
Ranchers
Sheridan County authorities have
issued a warning to farmers, ranchers
:>nd bankers to beware of one F. H.
, Smith, posing as a horse buyer for a
, . . ,. . ,
lug ( hicago live stock company.
They declare they have evidence to
show that the man is an imposter,
j w the fipm hp daims to be connected
;
At Poplar Smith drew two drafts,
one for $25,000, and another for $20,
000 on the Drexel State Bank of Chi
cago, but the Chicago bank says that
Smith is unknown to them. Several
other checks which were given in pay
ment of bills came back with payment
refused, says the Poplar Standard.
According to the report, Smith
started in to buy horses on a big
scale. He bargained for several large
strings, and branded one bunch of
them. The theory advanced is that
Smith figured to get a big bunch ^of
horses together, load them quick, and
by making a quick sale, beat the game
before he was discovered.
He has been gone some time now
and with every evidence that he is
gone for good. Farmers in other sec
tions are warned to be on the lookout
for the horse-buying stranger.
