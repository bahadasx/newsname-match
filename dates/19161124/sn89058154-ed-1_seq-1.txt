The ginnera' report made Nov.
1, 'shows for Tennessee a total of
228,450, bales for this year,
against 146,886 for 1915. . Mc
Nairy county shows 6, 175 against
6,613 for 1915. That means to
the county so far $617,500, esti
mating an average of $100 per
bale, which it will do, counting,
of course, the seed. The crop
will give McNairy county three-
fourths of a million dollars for
the 1916 crop.
Game Laws "
We give below the game laws
. of Tennessee for the benefit of
our readers. They are compiled
by the state game warden and he
calls upon the citizens of the
state to observe them, and prose
cutions will be rigidly enforced.
We trust our people will be law
abiding. ,
Birds are considered the farm
er's best friends. It is claimed
the quail is the enemy of the
boll-weevil. There is a good
' crop of quail, and if unmolestod
will be abundant in the future.
Those who have notices in the
Independent mean business, and
- we trust that none will put them
selves in jeopardy.
The following is the law:

New York Letter
I am back here in New York, amid
the. told, raw winds, the hurrying
crowds, and the sordid cares of office,
but thoughts of smiling Tennessee
and the old friends and kin folks are
with me, and I long to be able to
spend at least part-of the year there
raising things to eat, and eating my
share of them. : To many men who
have come from the farm to the city
these desires cmd dreams will often
return, and happy is he who can earn
enough in the cjty to afford to spend
the rest of his life on a farm! '
The contented gruntings of Clem
Lea's tremendous hogs still linger in
my ears, and I have day-dreams of
those 600-pound porkers that are
oafing around his premises and get
ting ready for the scalding kettle,
the knife and the gambril. Just think
Of turning out those great, big greasy
giants by the hundreds for two or
three cents a pound, as Clem has
done with the few he has, and send-
ng them off to St. Lous and Chicago,
to warm the hearts (and stomachs)
of the cold and hungry!
I called on Mr. H. W. Collingwood,
(he editor of the Rural New Yorker
of this city, the other day. (the fore
most farm paper in America, if not in
the whole world) and talked to him
about Clem Lea and his hogs; how
Clem trimmed up his oak trees and
pastured the woods with hogs, and
bow the acorn yield was increased by
this simple treatment. Mr. Colling
wood was very much interested, and
asked me to write it up for his paper,
which I promised to do. Clem preach
es a sermon from a text that every
one can understand, about using tVe
nsourcea of nature in a coram' n
sense way, and if his ideas were fully
followed out, western Tennessee would
soon be famous as a stock-growing
center. He pins his faith to lespe
deza and other clovers and legumes
that thrive there, and raises not only
hogs but also the quality of his soil
at the same time. If he had the
money andthe time to follow out
those ideas he would make himself
and the country around Selmer im
mensely rich. .
On the train coming back to New
York, I had the good fortune to meet
Mr. Frederick C. Minkler, director of
the New Jersey State Agricultural
College, who makes a specialty of
hog-raising. For several hours he
gave me most valuabje information
covering almost the whole range of
swinology.and it was the most interest
ing talk I ever listened to. It is inspir
ing to listen to a man who is a rea
master of his Subject, and this man is
such a master. He believes that the
hog business, if carried on so as to
raise them on mixed rations raised on
a Farm in Tennessee, offers the best
outlook for ready-cash farming that
he knows of. Mr. Minkler showed
pictures of hogs weighing over 1,000
pounds each, of the Duroc breed.
vhich he says has proved best for
the South, or at least for Kentucky
He also told all about the anti-cholera
serum and its effects, which are onl
temporary and in some cases retard
the growth of the hog, and should
only be used when cholera breaks ot
in a herd; of crude-oil dips for lice,
how to make hog houses for $10
apiece; of self-feeders he has devised;
of the land and the capital needed
for certain sized herds, and a hundred
other essential things about hog
raising. He invited mo to come and
see him, and to visit the great hog
ranch at Secaucus, N. J., where
20,0(10 hogs are raised on city garb-
'9- '
it seems to me that a hog farm and
a cow ranch would go-well together,
the skim milk being one of the best
and cheapest of all pig feeds. A
creamery would take care of all the
butter-fat,'and the skim milk turned
into pork would pay big dividends
A writer in this week's Rural New
York who says he lives in Tennessee
wishes to know about how to raise
hogs in New York, and the paper
tells him very properly that he had
better stick to Tennessee, where the
summer season is longer and the feed
and land cheaper. He , is reminded,
however, that hog raising means
work, and that he cannot manage
such a ranch from a roller-topped
desk. . -
