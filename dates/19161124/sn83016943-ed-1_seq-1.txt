Now, John' Sharp is no dude.
He haa not the appearance of an
Apollo, and his is not a tuneful
tongue. I am always reminded of
an anecdote taken from French
history when John rises to make a
speech. - A.t the siege of Toulon,
Dugommier, the commander .of
the French forces, was holding a
conference with his generals and
Bonaparte, then a subordinate,
left the councils. A general spoke
up and asked who "that little in.
gain the victory. We kept three of
the four voteB which that city had.
The road will be a graveled high
way, within a few months, from Chi
cago to thr Vempef county l'ne . this
state. It u ' .i g.avelit
Kemper county line to New
Orleans. We can do this if we can get
the co-operation of the counties
through which it will pass. One man
who owns a third of the land in Han
cock county told m that he would
pay the entire coat of graveling
through his property if the rest of the
county would attend to that which did
not touch it.
"Work is being done now in the
Pearl river swamp. Gravel is being
placed on the road that is thrown up
by e dredge and. the time is not fa
distant when wa shall be ablo to ride
on a gravel road from Meridian to
New Orleans."

the commander reolied, "That lit
tle insignificant officer is a greater
man than any of us."
When John Sharp Williams
takes the floor in the United
States Sedate the chamber and the
galleries give ear. He never rises
unless he has something to say
and before ne nas nnisned says
something that will give the Sen
ate food for thought. That., is
why John Sharp Williams is the
biggest man in the United States
Senate. As a debater the Senate
nas not known ms matcn since
Allen G. Thurman and Ben Hill
and in a rough and tumble, I
don't know John Sharp Williams'
match since Stephen A. Douglas.
Francis Jeffry, the famous es
sayist of the Edinburg Beview,
opined that had Benjamin Frank
lin been a graduate oi Harvard
the world would never have heard
of him, and it is doubtless true
that many considerable men have
been spoiled by classical educa
tion, but there are numerous cases
Where college training has been
of great assistance. James A.
Garfield is one example; so is John
Sharp Williams. Cabot Lodge is
another. John Sharp Williams is
perhaps the best educated man in
Congress. Not only is he a grad
uate of the Unn ersity of Virginia,
but he studied at famous schools
in Germany and France.
All a college is for is to fit
a
man to be a student. This country ing indeed to hear him tell
is lull of college graduates who times and older people of
Mrs. A. D. Binion received a phone
message Wednesday morning announc
ing the death at French Camp of her
brother, Mr. Norman McLeod. He
was in his ninety-seventh year and hia
death was due to general infirmities.
The deceased was born in January,
1820, in Greene county. Miss., and
came with his father to Noxubee soon
after the removal of the Indians to the
west. He was married three timeB
first to Miss Sarah Hopkins, daughter
of Dr. Hopkins, afterwards he mar
ried Miss Wootten of Brooksville. His
wife, who survives him, was Miss Sue
Rosser, daughter of Dr. Levi Rosser,
of this county. After the death of
his first wife, he went to the "Mississ
ippi Swamp" as the delta was called
in those days, where he cleared up and
made himself a home for many years,
where the town of Indianola is now
situated. Afterwards fearing for the
health of his wife and children, be sold
out and came back to Noxubee, where
he lived a few years, then on account
of the excellent school advantages at
French Camps, he bought a home and
lived there until hi death, at 8. 30
o'clock on Nov. 22nd.
For many years he has been a de-
vated member of the Presbyterian
church.
Though afflicted with blindness sev
eral years before his death, his mind
waa clear and vigorous and he was
much interested and well posted on
all public affairs.
Blessed with a good memory and
keen sense of humor, it waa intereat-

The Noxubee County Teachers
Association met last Saturday for their
second regular meeting with about
forty members present. If it is re-
-
membered that there are only about
fifty white teachers in the county this
is a very fine attendance on the part of
the teachers and shows a healthy in
terest In progressive and co-operative
school work.
The program was a very Interesting
. ... i
one; all those to whom supjecta were
assigned were present and rendered ex
cellent papers. The program was
follows:
The Alms of the Recitation, a paper.
by Mrs. McLeod.
The Importance of the Assignment,
a paper by Miss Douglass.
The Imimrtance of Clear Picturing, a
paper by Miss Adams.
Our Most Prevalent Mistakes In the
Recitation, a naner by Miss Annie
S tennis.
The discussion of these subjects led
by Messrs. Chandler, McMillan. Dabbs,
and Stubblefield were omitted by the
association in order to give more time
I to Mr. R. H. Pae of the A. & M. col
lege, who was here by invitation of I
the countv superintendent to discuss I
running water for farm homea.
Mr. Pate is an effective speaker on
any subject, particularly so on any
subject pertaining to better conditions
for the farmer. It is hoped that the
teachers who were forturate enough
to hear him may go back to their com-
munities with a purpose to assist in
improving the conditions, for the farm-l
ers' wives. The A. & M. college
authorities have worked out plans and
specifications for home water works
which can be installed for the extreme
ly small sum of $18.40. The college
further agrees to send a man at their
own expense to install this system, or
one of the more expensive ones at any
time they are called on; surely the
teacher who lives in a community
where not a home has running water
pill do that community a great service

It is possible some of tne teachers of
the county are not familiar with the
law passed by the Mississippi Legis

a legal holiday for all public schools.
This day is now a legal holiday and
teachers in making their monthly re-

Judge,
Jhe South' All Right
The Democratic victory has
evoked the customary expressions
of indignation at the South for
the supposed crime of going Dem
ocratic from a few unreconciled
citizens and from a grouchy news
paper organ here and there.
Isn't it getting about time for
that sort of thing to stop! The
South's all right. If she wants
to go Democratic, why, bless her,
let her keep it up as long as she
feels like it. That's her business,
and the overwhelming majority of
people around here and every
where else iu the North are per
fectly willing to let her attend to
it. They have business enough
of their own to keep them fairly
occupied.
What is more, if the south
keeps on furnishing a quality of
public men for committee chair,
mauships and legislators superior
to those the northern Democrats
seem to be able to find, there's no
sound objection to that either.
The South has sense enough to
keep her leading public men in
office until they acquire prestige
and experience. Thire arc other
parts of the country that might
learn a useful leon from it iu
that regard.
Economic conditions in the
South are chant;. ng arid those con
ditions are sure to result in a
growing uivisi... of political opin
ion. It's suga'- that makes Louis
iana look more kindly to the Re
publican doctiine of protection
and not ait.u:K on sectional
grounds. And its factories and a
growing diversification of industry
that will lay the foundation for a
newer point of . vir w on the part
of great numbers of southerners.
While this process goes inevitably
forward, northern and eastern and
western citizens are going to keep
on liking the South just as much
as ever.
And they do like her well,
you might say love her without
making it too strong. "When
we know each other better we will
love each other more" has cer
tainly worked out in the rclationa
of the northern and southern sec
tions of this country. Nobody is
going to make a hit either in pub
lic or private by attacking the
South these days. It happens to
be a notorious fact that about one
of the best ways to make a hit in
public is to praise her or strike
up "Dixie" or something that
calls her to mind.
Southern newspapers needn't
get unduly excited over the occa
sional outbursts of spleen in a
newspaper here and there. Those
things mean just as little as the)
occasional outbursts against tho
North down .South. There are al
ways some newspapers locking for
a popular way to be unpleasant
and failing to liud it. But no
body pays a great deal of atten
tion to them up here, and we
trust they pay as little attention
to the type across the Macon and
Dixon line. Chicago Herald.

Since the discoveries of gold
the Klondike twenty years ago
most of us have thought of Alaska
in tcims of the yellow metal. It
is more fitting however, to think
of it in terms of salmon. Last
year Alaska shipped to this coun
try 8-8,307,000 worth of canned
salmon and $10,200,000 worth of
gold. There were also many mil
liou dollars' worth of copper, sil

output for a region that Uncle
Sam paid $7,200,000 for half a
century ago. Moreover, Alaska
