CHARLESTON. Nov. 24?Investigation
of the charge that efforts were
being made to induce members of the
house of delegates by use of large
sums of money and promises of political
preferment to oppose the legislative
program of Governor Hatfield
made Thursday in the house by
T. L. Wolfe, of Ripley, and who was
later appointed chairman of the investigating
committee, was delayed
Friday morning until Friday afternoon.
Chairman Wofe conferred for
an hour with Thomas Townsend,
prosecuting attorney of Kanawha
county, and then announced to the
committee assembled in the governor's
reception room that subpoenas
would not issued until noon. The session
was rapidly drawing to a close,
he said, and about all the committee
could do would be to place in the
prosecuting attorney's hands such information
as he could later use in his
official capacity.
Delegates James R. Moreland, a
Democrat member of the cpmmittee
from Morgantown. reminded the
chairman that Thursday night had
been wasted as Friday morning was
being wasted and the House did not
want to rest under the charge any
longer than was absolutely necessary.
Wolfe said all possible haste would be
made and the subpoenas woud be issued
in a few hours.
It was understood that some of the
witneses wanted were not now in
Charleston. Mr. Townsend said that j
a dozen or more witnesses would likely
be called Friday.

SIR HIRAM
EXPIRES 1
Inventor of the Automatic System
of Fire Arms is
Claimed by Death.
<?r ASSOCIATED FEUS)
LON'DOX. Xov. 24.?Sir Hiram Maxim,
inventor of the automatic system
of fire arms, died at his home here
early Friday morning.
Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim, Americanborn,
was one of the most famous inventors.
civil, mechanical and electrical
engineers of Great Britain. He
was most widely known as the In
veil tor of the Maxim machine gun,
which makes the recoil of the weapon
Berve as the power for reloading, and
j which is the weapon largely used in
the European war today.
He was born in Sangerville, Me,,
February 5, 1840, the son of iBaac
Weston and Harriet M. Maxim, and received
only a common school education,
but he acquired scientific knowledge
by reading and attending lectures. He
went to England in 1881, and had resided
there ever since. He was knighted
by Queen Victoria in 1901.
His son, Hiram Percy Maxim, is a
well known inventor in the United
States, known particularly as the inventor
of the Maxim silencer. {.
For many years Sir Hiram was a director
In the firm of Vickers Sons
and (Maxim, but resigned that post in
1911. For more than thirty years he
experimented in aeronautics and Invented
flying machines. In the light of
the present war, with its numerous
German airship raids on England, it Is
remarkably interesting to recall that
eight years ago Sir Hiram took the
British nation to task for its small
interest in aeronautics, and pointed out
then, at a time when aeroplanes were
in their infancy, that England was In
grave danger of bombardment by airships.
"Does any one donbt for a moment,"
said he, "that in case we find ourselves
FINAL SES

Dr. Frank N. Palmer, of Winona
Lake, Ind., and' Mrs. George Geyer
deliver the final addreses on the program
of the institute. The institute
has been one of the most successful
ever conducted in the county. The
attendance at all the sessions has
been large and the speakers on the
program at the different sessions
were the best ever brought to this
city. *
Dr. Palmer and Mrs. Geyer delivered
interesting and educating talks
at the Friday afternoon session but
their best addresses were held over
for the closing program tonight.
Thursday afternoon, C. W. Shinn,
of Toedo. O., educational director of
the Ashland Avenue Baptist church,
talked on "The Manning ot Different
Departments of the Sunday School,"
and at the evening session his subSect
was "Why Sunday Schoos are
not Worth More to the Church."
Both talks were very good and notwithstanding
the inclement weather
of Thursday evening a large audience
enjoyed the talk.
"How to Teach the Lesson," was
the subject selected by Aflred Day, ol
new IUI VL XUlXli*3I DCUlCtttl J' VI
New York Sunday School Association,
for his address Thursday afternoon
and at the evening session he chose as
his subject "The Home and Mother."
Both of the subjects were very nicely

enjoyed by all present.

Following the success of the Wright
biplane. Sir Hiram renewed ,his long
continued interest in aviation and In
1910 perfected a machine which he de-j
clared had. oertain advantages over thei
Wright's. It was he who, with others, j
interested the British government in [
beginning its organization of an aerial
navy, and though he was then 70 years
old he lived to see the great war bring
air fighting to pass in even greater
probably, than he himself had
dreamed.
.^ition to his gun and aeroplane,
he patented many electrical inventions,
including Incandescent lamps, selfregulating
current machines, several
pieces of ordance? and a smokeless
powfier.
The aged inventor took a keen interest
In the war, and from time to time
there were unconfirmed reports of his
Invention of devices to meet the needs
of the war, one of them being an apparatus
to counteract the effects of the
poisonous gases which the Germans
were first to bring into use. In 1915
he was appointed a member of the inventions
board of the British munitions
department under Lloyd George.
Sir Hiram applied himself so strenuously
to science throughout his long
life thht even his recreations were
given by him as "reading scientific
dooks ana suiaying tne abstract
sciences." He wrote many important
articles, and an autobiography, "My
Life," in 1915.
He was a chevalier of the Legion of
Honor, a member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers, the Royal Society
of Arts, the British Association
for the Advancement of Science and
numerous other scientific bodies.

DAY NURSERY
IS INDORSED
BY MR WHITE
Wtio Gives Several Cogent Reasons
in an Article Contributed
to the Telegram.
J. E. White, superintendent of the
First Baptist Sunday school, writes
follows about the day nursery
here: ,
I will give a few reasons why wo,
as citizens, should encourage the opening
of a day nursery. First, because
we, as citizens; must take care of our
poor, who are left destitute.
Second, because we should not only
look after their present needs, but
do it in a manner to help them also
in the future.
Third. In a way that will make the
dollar do the greatest amount of
good.
Fourth, we as Christians are
fftllflfTif 4 Vi o f if io /l?i f?? 4 ?- IamI*
uiai, ill A.a vui UUL/ ty ll^un. ?iter
the widows and orphans, therebyreducing
the cost of caring for themselves.
' What is the work of a day nursery?
It is this: Should a widow be left
with small children, she may be
strong enough to go out and work
to support them if she has some place
she knows they are safe and taken
care of.
So the day nursery will keep these
children for a very small fee ajld see
that they have proper food and care.
Clarksburg must make some advancemehts
along these lines or fall
behind other great cltiesr which are
doing a similar work.
When an appeal Is made let us
give liberally. Read Psalms 68:5;
also read James 1:27.

( V ASSOCIATED PRIKl
SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 24.?Within
the last 11 vo months the most complete
medical organization known to the
the United States army has been developed
to care for the 150.000 state
and regular troops stationed at border
joints and in Mexico.
The syBtein Includes five base hospitals,
located at strategic points In
the long stretch of border territory;
eight camp hospitals at other points
where troops are stationed, a canton
ment hospital at Columbus, N. M., to
serve the force on duty In Mexico,
and twenty-six ambulance companies
and forty-one field hospitals distributed
among troops In the field.
The base and camp hospitals afford
accommodation for a total of 4,600
patients and have medical and surgical
facilities, equal to the finest
hospitals. Not more than half the
beds have been occupied at any one
time since the nation's militia
strength was called into the federal
service, but the room is available in
case of need.
Back of this array is the potential
organization. A hospital train of ten
Pullman cars, with a capacity of 250
patients, has been placed In use to
transport patients from the camp to
the baso hospitals and from base hospitals
to general military hospitals In
various parts of the country, should
a campaign in Mexico be undertaken.
These lhrger Institutions are the Walter
Reed hospital at Washington, D.
C., the General Army and Navy hospital
at Hot Springs, Ark'., and the
L>ettimann hospital at San Francisco.
About 1,200 beds are vacant In the
three hospitals at the present time.
In addition, a number of army posts
have been selected for transformation
Into general hospitals in case of
emergency. This list includes Fort
McPherson, at Atlanta; Fort Oglethorpe,
also in Georgia; Fort Benjamin
Harrison, Indianapolis, and other
army stations where barracks are |
available for hospital purposes. *
The medical corps;~has complete
equipment in storage for twenty evacuation
hospitals and two base hospitals.
