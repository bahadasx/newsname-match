UNTRAINED YOUTH
TO RULE AUSTRIA
DEATH AT LAST CLAIMS FRANZ
JOSEPH. EMPEROR FOR
ox YEARS.
The eyes of Europe are turned now
cn the Archduke Charles Francis Jo
seph, emperor of Austro-Hungary,
now that official confirmation lias
been given of the death Tuesday of
the aged emperor Franz Josef, one
of the strongest rulers of modern
times. The new ruler of the nation,
whose demands on Serbia precipi
tated the great war. is 2!t years of
age.
The death of Franz Josef ends a
reign longer than any in modern his
tory, except that of Louis XIV. of
France —and Louis, unlike the Haps
burg sovereign, ascended the throne
v-hen a mere child of five.
It was a reign bathed in blood and
shrouded in tragedies. Franz Josef
ascended the throne when lie was 18
years of ago and has therefore held
the scepter of imperial authority for
68 years. He was born August 18,
1830.
Starts and Ends In War.
War marked the beginning of his
reign, as war has marked its close.
Domestic tragedies, murders, sui
cides, violent deaths have decimated
Ms family. His dearest relative, as
a child, was his grandfather, a man
bowed with sorrows of having seen
Ms own aunt, Marie Antoinette, guil
lotined in Paris.
Five years after he had ascended
the throne he was seriously wounded
by a would-be assassin. Wars came
text and Internal dissensions. Then,
in 1889. his only son, the Crown
Prince Rudolph, died a violent death
near Vienna, the details of which,
even after these years, have never
been revealed. It was either a mur
der or a suicide, with the woman he
l ove d—probably no one will ever
know.
Nine years later, the empress, his
ccnsort, was assassinated in Geneva.
His favorite niece was next the vic
tim of the family misfortune, burn
inn to death at Schoenbrunn. The
Duchess d'Alencon. favorite of his
wife's sisters, died in the charity
bazaar fire in Paris.
Meanwhile, constantly a reminder
of tragedy, was the Empress Carlotta,
who lost her reason years before
when her husband Emperor Maxmll
ir.n of Mexico was executed.
The next domestic tragedy oc
curred when the Archduke John, the
emperor's nephew and heir to the
throne, renounced his royalty, took
the name of John Orth, and sailed
away with the woman he loved. The
earth swallowed him up. He has
never been heard from since.
A little later the Archduke Will
lam Francis Charles, another of the
royal family, died from a hunting
fall. Then Archduke Ladislaus was
horribly wounded by accidental gun
fire. Last of all, his heir, the Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, who had
been forgiven for contracting a mor
ganatic marriage, was assassinated,
with his morganatic wife at Serajevo,
Bosnia. It was on the ground that
this assassination was done by Serb
ians that Austria started the great
conflagration of the European war
by declaring war on Serbia.
The man who will now become
Austria's ruler is known to have had
p Rood military education and has
achieved some success as a military
commander in the great war. He has
lacked any training whatever in
statecraft or diplomacy. Moreover,
he assumes the throne at a time when
♦he strongest of men would have a
tr.sk in maintaining the empire of
Austro-Tlungary intact and strong.
Democratically inclined, very little
vias known of him up to the time that
ar. assassin's bullet murdered the
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the
heir, in Sarajevo, June 28, 1914.
Hungary has grown restive under
the yoke. Strong leaders
of men have recently appeared there.
They fear swallowing up of Hungary
ii. the Teutonic empire and have not
hesitated to express that belief and
Vork for Hungary as a separate
kingdom.
Rut immediate results of the re
moval of the strong figure of the
aged emperor are believed to mean
on increase in Prusssian domination
of the central empires.

AWARDS TOWER CONTRACT,
Council Gives W. A. Writer Job of
Building Water Improvement.
After considerable argument over
plans and specifications for the work,
at two meetings, the city council by
<i vote of 4 to 8 at a special meeting
Wednesday evening awarded Con-
tractor W. A. Weller, of this city, the
contract for constructing the new
water tower on the Westside, on a
bid of $3,434.
When the bids were first opened
'i uesday evening it was discovered
t! at none of the contractors had sub
mitted a proposal on the plans as pre
vailed by City Engineer J. H. Wed
('<•ll. and in the discussion that fol
lowed a Portland engineer, declaring
that Weddell's plans were not fea
sible, withdrew his bid. At Wednes
day's meeting Engineer Weddell told
tic council the tower would be built
on his plans modified to conform with
certain features of Weller's plans.
MRS. BUSHNELL ASKS
WILL BE SET ASIDE
CONTENDS HUSBAND HAD BEEN
INSANE FOR YEARS—LOCAL
Declaring that her husband, who
died at Manitowoc, Wis., July 5 last,
had been insane for years and that
he had been taken from an asylum
<n Illinois to a hospital in Wisconsin,
where a will and a codicil were dic
tated by a relative, Mrs. G. M. Bush
rell, a wealthy rancher of this coun
ty, filed answer this week in the
King county superior court to a pe
tition recently filed there for probate
of her husband's will.
The will purported to devise dece
dent's property to Mrs. Bushnell and
a number of nieces and nephews and
asserted that Mr. Bushnell was of
sound mind at the time of his death.
The will represented also to bequeath
the Bushnell ranch in this county as
community property between Bush
rell and his wife.
In her answer Mrs. Bushnell denies
that the Thurston county land was
community property, but avers that
she is the sole owner. She denies
j that her husband left any property
! whatever in this state.
According to the widow's answer,
the couple lived in Tacoma in 1890.
Bushnell went to New York, she af
firms, where he was adjudged insane
and put in an asylum at Blooming
dale. He escaped from the New York
I'.sylum, she relates, and went to Chi
cago, where he again was taken into
custody and sent to the asylum at
Kankakee. At the latter asylum he
remained, she contends, until two or
three years ago. He was past 80
years of age.
The widow charges that through
the instrumentality of a relative
Bushnell was taken from Kankakee
and placed in a hospital at Manito
woc, Wis. Here, she alleges, he was
induced to make a will and to add a
codicil. The will, the widow deposes,
was dictated by the relative, and
"might have been signed by Bush
nell." She asks that it be declared
void.
WARNS HALED HAY BUYERS.
Government Inventigatinji Practice j
of Veneering Bal«.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 24. — [
The United States Department of
Agriculture is investigating the prac-;
tice of some shippers of hay of
veneering or facing the bales.
Veneering consists in feeding to
baling machine an occasional fork- ;
ful of hay that Is of higher srade
than the bulk of the lot being baled
mid manipulating the forkful in such
a way that the high grade hay cov
ers the outside of the bale, making
the bale appear to contain better hay
than it actually does contain.
The National Hay Association has
requested the Department of Agri
culture to co-operate with it in try
ing to eliminate this practice be
lieved to be dishonest. Huyers of
baled hay are warned to be on the
lookout for this practice in order to
avoid accepting on a cursory examin
ation a lower grade of hay than they
intend to purchase.

FIGHT STARTS IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY RANKS
IRENHOLME DEMANDS POGARTY RESIGN AS STATE CHAIRMAN—
liATTER SARCASTICALLY REFUSES CONTEST CENTERS
AROUND EFFORTS OF PROGRESSIVE ELEMENT TO OUST WAL
LACE FOLLOWERS FROM CONTROL OF ORGANIZATION.
Democratic political circles of the
state, and particularly here in Olym
pia, have been stirred with excite
ment this week over the open letter
sent to John B. Fogarty, of Everett,
the other day by J. D. Trenholme, of
Seattle, demanding that Fogarty re
sign as state chairman of the party,
and Fogarty's sarcastic reply, refus
ing to resign and daring Trenholme
to do his worst.
In his demand Trenholme charges
that the future of the Demosratic
rarty in the state depends upon pos
sessing the confidence of the pro
gressive an.l independent voters,
something ho declares is impossible
under the Fogarty regime. He as
serts that tho election of Fogarty as
state chairman was brought about
by methods which approached coer
cion, and that two federal officehold
ers, in aiding Fogarty. committed a
grave offense, which is punishable
severely by law. and declares that
the campaign conducted by Fogarty
rs state chairman "was not in the
interest of *he candidates on the
state ticket."
In his reply. Fogartv says "you
are the firsj to even suggest that the
campaign was not in the interest of
all the candidates": points out that
Dill, the state's first Democratic con
gressman, was elected and re-elected
and the state carried by Wilson dur
ing his regime as chairman: says that
p.s to proxies "my opponent and I
ere both tarrnd with the same stick":
and tells Trenholme to "go to it" on
his "veiled threat to prefer charges
against some federal appointees."

C. D. KING CRITICALLY
ILL WITH APPENDICITIS
i
Local Attorney. Taken Sick Sud
denly, Re|M>rted to lie in
Grave Condition.
Charles D. King, one of the best
known attorneys of Olympia and an
old-time resident, is reported to be
critically ill at St. Peter's hospital,
following an operation for appendi
citis hastily performed late Wednes
day afternoon. His condition Thurs
day afternoon was such that the at
tending physician, Dr. N. J. Redt ath,
held out little hope for recovery.
Mr. King was taken suddenly ill at
his office and was removed directly
10 the hospital As late as 2 o'clock
that afternoon he was out on the
street talking with various friends,
and made no complaints other 'han
that he was tired from a business
trip he had taken to Seattle the day
before.
Word tha* he had undergone an
operation an 1 was in a critical con
dition quickly circulated about the
city and was a great surprise tj his
riany friends and acquaintances.
CROPS BOUGHT AND LEFT
TO ROT TO BOOST PRICES.
So Government I yearns In Its Inves
tigation of High Cost of
Living.
CHICAGO, Nov. 24. —definite In
formation to support rumors that
produce dealers are permitting fruits
and vegetables to rot in the fields in
order to cause a shortage and in
crease prices, came to the govern
ment officials who are investigating
the causes of the present high prices
of food.
B. L. Brundage, a farmer of Gary,
lnd., reported that he had sold his
ciop of seven acres of pumpkins for
cash. When the crop ripened and
the pumpkins were allowed to rot In
tLe field, he tried to find the buyer
and learned that the name and ad
dtess he had given were fictitious.
That similar conditions prevail
elsewhere and that speculators are
buying potatoes, cucumbers, cabbage,
pumpkins, apples and other fruits
and vegetables and allowing them to
rot unpicked, have been rumored in
tbe federal investigation from time to
time.
lo be a bitter contest between the
progressive faction of the party,
l>eaded by Governor Lister, and the
Wallace-Fogarty faction, generally
rtyled as conservatives, standpatters
and reactionaries.
The purpose of the fight is, first
of all. to destroy National Commit
teeman Hugh C. Wallace's influence
at Washington, and then to build up
a Democratic organization in this
state that will be controlled by the
rrogressive or liberal, or advanced,
or plain, common Lister element.
It goes without saying that the
men leading the antl-Fogarty fight
intend to make Governor Ernest Lis
ter their leader, whether through
active co-operation or by tacit con
sent to the use of his name.
Former United States Senator
George Tuner is declared to have
pledged himself to aid the contro
versy. In any event it has been
made plain that he has come to real
izf that he was the "goat" and that
ty not breaking definitely with the
Fogarty organization he not only
lest the pledges of support they jrave,
but failed to get the full sympathy
of the Llsterltes. Now that the cam
paign is over and Turner is fr< e to
rpeak his mind he is quoted as de
claring that undoubtedly he was sac
rificed to bol'ter up the federal brig
a tip's power.
Charges Against Officials.
| When the anti-Fogarty forces, led

; vill file direct charges against two
or three federal appointees, alleging
'they not only violated departmental
orders, but p.'fo violated federal stat-

FARMERS LOOKING FORWARD
TO COURSE BY STATE COL
LEGE EXPERTS.
Much interest is reported among
| tbe farmers of the county in the se
, rles of lectures on farm, agricultural
and home economic topics to be de
livered here during the extension
course offered by the State College
the week of December 4 to 9, under
the auspifces of the agricultural bu
reau of the Chamber of Commerce.
All of the Granges and other or
ganizations of the county have re
ceived letters regarding the exten
sion school, announcing the dates
and urging lie clubs to encourage
attendance by their members, and
Chairman C. C. Aspinwall, of the
agricultural bureau, plans to send
out letters to several hundred farm
ers in the county—all those whose
inames and addresses he can get—
'giving them detailed information as
|to the course and specifically urging
'each one of them to attend.
! Leading farmers of the county and
the different organizations are co-op

extension school, and ip the prelim
inary campaign which seeks to per
suade as many farmers as possible
to attend, so that the school will be
highly successful in every way and

Chamber of Commerce, made ar
rangements this week with the Olym

HUGHES FINALLY
CONCEDES ELECTION
SKXDH CONGRATULATORY TELE
GRAM TO PRESIDENT WILSON
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
After waiting just a day more
than two weeks since the election,
Charles K. Hughes, Republican can
didate for President in the recent
campaign, Wednesday night sent
President Wilson a telegram congrat
ulating him upon his victory at the
polls.
In his telegram Mr. Hughes said:
"Bectiuse of the closeness of the
vote I have awaited the official count
in California, and now that it has
been virtually completed, permit me
to extend to you my congratulations
upon your re-election. I desire also
to express my best wishes for a suc
cessful administration."
Mr. Hughes' telegram removed all
question as to President Wilson's re
election, which had been generally
acknowledged two weeks ago.
The same evening William R. Wil
cox, chairman of the Republican na
tional committee, issued the follow
ing statement:
"Having conferred by telephone
during the day and late this after
noon with the Republican state com
mittee and the Republican national
committee in California, I am In
formed that the official canvass of
the vote has been so nearly complet
ed that no change will result from
the few precincts not counted In the
returns thus far compiled.
"This means that the majority for
the Wilson electors In California
ranges from about 1,200 to 3,800
votes and that this is the final result
cf the canvasß for which we have
been waiting. So far as any recount
is concerned, the national committee
is not advised that there are suffi
cient grounds to call for such an ap
plication."
President Wilson was attending a
theater at the time Mr. Hughes' tel
egram was received at the White
House.

Illicit Idquor Traffic, Says Allen
Bootleggers who cause liquor to
be shipped into this state from Brit
