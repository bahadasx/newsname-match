GEORGE FERNANDEZ DROWNS
BAYOU
BOEUF
Falls Overboard From Launch Id Darkness. Second
Similar Tragedy of the Week.
For the second time within the
span of a week, Morgan City hears
with horror of an accident which has
resulted in the death of another of
her stalwart young men and valued
citizens. Late Thursday evening,
while returning by boat with a
crowd of co-workers from the scene
of their employment with the Wad
dell-Williams Lumber Company on
the eastern outskirts of this city,
George Fernandez, employed as a
stenographer s in the office of that
concern, fell into the deep waters of
Bayou Boeuf and was drowned,
while his companions, unable to ren
der assistance, because of the dark
ness that created an impenetrable
veil between them and the dying
man, stood on the stern of the
launch helpless to sense the catas
trophe or to lend aid to the victim.
A searching party recovered the
body of Fernandez within an hour,
too late, however, to revive him.
The mill employers were returning
from their labors by boat, as is their
custom, after the days work was
done. From Rhoda, the site of the
Waddell-Williams mill, to Avoca an
uninterrupted run was made. At a
point near Avoca, the launch was
slowed down to permit one of the
passengers to get off. He landed
near a barge load of cane. Standing
on the stern of the boat with a num
ber of others and as the boat was
nearing the barge, it is said that
Fernandez reached out for a stalk
of cane: He grasped it but the cane
was evidently fast to the barge and
the movement of the launch caused
him to be jerked into the Bayou.
The water at that place is about ten
feet deep. Wearing a raincoat which
probably handicapped him in his
struggles in the water, Fernandez
made a few swimming strokes then
sank from view and was seen no
more. No cries was heard from the
drowning man and did he shout for
help the words were probably in
audible because of the noise created
by the exhaust of the gas engine in
the boat.
Knowing that their comrade had
fallen overboard, yet unable to
locate him in the darkness, the other
gentlemen on board were at a loss
to tell his whereabouts. A negro
nearby in a skiff claims that he saw
the accident but that his skiff was
between the bank and the barge and
that he was thus prevented in reach
ing the place until Fernandez had
sunk from view. A searching party

was hurriedly gathered and before
an hour had passed the lifeless body
of the unfortunate man was dis
covered. The corpse was brought in
to this city and laid out in a local
undertaking establishment, whence
it was taken to the Fernandez resi
dence on Duke Street.
The loss of her devoted husband
prostrated the young wife. Happily
wedded but about eightteen months,
the nineteen year-old widow of
young Fernandez has suffered a
paralizing sorrow which calls forth
the heartfelt sympathy of the entire
city. On th*» threshhold of a life of
promise and with well-laid plans fo r
the future, Fate unfolds her hide«,.,:;
arms and demolishes their house of
dreams, laying waste to the fertile
field of life which spread smoothly
out If fore them. It is understood
'that Ivlr. Fernandez contemplated
leavinp the city shortly for Natchi
toches, La., where he had accepted
a position. He was a native of Si.
Mary Parish and his birthplace was
at Centreville where the body was
taken this morning on train No. 5
for burial. The deceased was twenty
seven years of age and was a highly
esteemed and honorable citizen.
Relatives and friends who had has
tened to this city on bçjw informed
of the tragedy accompanied the body
and the sorrowing widow to the
scene of his birthplace where funeral
services will be held and the body
consigned to its last resting place.
The tragic death of George Fer
nandez follows closely in the wake
of the fearful accident which de
prived Charles Lirette, another
young man held in high esteem in
this city, of his life. This death oc
curred on Tuesday evening of thisj
week and resulted from injuries re
ceived while the young man was per
forming his duties as flagman on
the local railroad siding. With this
terrible mishap still fresh in the :
minds of the community, the drown- 1
ing of young Fernandez, coming i
with shocking unexpectedness, has :
intensified the gloom of sorrow that
had already enfolded the city. Like
a bolt from the blue sky, these
deaths have transpired and it is the
vivid example of the passage that "in
life there is death," forcing its
meaning upon the minds of onlook
ers, which causes them to feel deep
ly and keenly the great loss to their
citizenship and the uncertainties
which attend the seemingly safe
routine of existence as lived by men
in their walks of daily endeavor.
