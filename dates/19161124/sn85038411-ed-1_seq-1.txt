TROOPS DIDN'T
* VOTE ON JITNEY
OR SCHOOL LOAN
Returns From Border Show
That Soldiers Had Voted on
Neither Question
ONLY LOCAL ISSUES
So State Sent Down No Tickets;
Troop "C" Count First;
Splendid Records
Harrisburg voters who are doing
police duty for Uncle Sam along the
Border didn't voice their sentiments on
either the high school loan or the Jit
ney problems, according to the returns
of the "soldier vote" which was opened
for official counting at noon to-day.
The bundle of packages from the
company officers which contained the
sealed tally sheets, registration books,
and ballots, were received a few days
after election but they couldn't be
opened until, to-day.
The remainder of the official count
including all the votes cast in the city
and county has been computed and to
taled but the final returns can not be
certified to until after the soldier vote
is computed.
For this reason, incidentally, Pro
thonotary Harry F. Holler couldn't
certify the jitney amendment return
nor the high school loan vote to Coun
cil or the School Board. Much to the
surprise of the election computing
board to-day, no returns of either the
jitney amendment nor the high school
loan question were included in the
vote from the Border. Inquiry from
State officials revealed the fact that
because these matters were entirely
local, the State had not officially ac
quainted the troops of the problems.
Incidentally, it developed that the
County Commissioners hadn't sent any
additional ballots to the Border for
the purpose, so the Harrisburg men
voted on neither question. Conse
quently, as soon as the official vote is
definitely completed, the Prothonotary
will certify to the count that has al
ready been made on the jitney and
high school loan questions in Harris
burg.
At Tuesday's meeting of Council, the
jitney amendment will be formally in
effect.
The first vote to be counted to-day
was included in the returns from
Troop C, of the Pennsylvania cavalry
command, the organization that had
formally been the Governor's Troop.
Additional Law Judge McCarrell com
mented enthusiastically on the splen
did appearance of the records and re
ports of the soldier election boards.
Miss Copelin to Go
'Long to Border With
Father at Yule Time
If train service doesn't go wrong
and the timetables aren't guilty of
false pretense. Miss Eleanor Copelin
and Christmas morning are due to ar
rive simultaneously at the far away
Border town of El Paso.
For Miss Copelin, who is the daugh
ter of Captain O. M. Copelin, ordnance
officer of the Eighth Regiment, Sev
enth Division of the United States
National Guard, is going to accom
pany her father to the Border when
he leaves here December 20, at the
expiration of a 30-day furlough. The
trip, it is expected will require about
four days.
Captain Copelin, who is an ex-city
treasurer, reached Harrisburg last
evening for a brief stay on home
leave. He visited the courthouse to
day and was kept mighty busy greet
ing friends in city and county of
ficialdom. Incidentally Captain Cope
lin said he "doesn't like the Border
duty"—the same complaint which so
many of the Pennsylvania men and
officers have voiced since the inac
tivity of police work has become so
monotonous.
When Captain Copelin goes back
to Texas he will take along a brief
communication from Captain H. M.
Stine, the recruiting officer, to Col
onel Maurice E. Finney, commander
of the Eighth urging that officer to
acquaint the men of the importance
of filing applications for assistance
for dependent families at home from
the $2,000,000 fund provided by Con
gress.

HARRISBURG, PA.,FRIDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 24, 1916
IS THE HIGH COST OF LIVING
A PROBLEM IN
LYING the high cost of living is the chief problem in every family just now.
Work is plentiful and the daily wage has been advanced in nearly all lines. But
the dollar's purchasing power has been steadily falling by reason of constantly in
creasing prices.
There appears to be no hope of immediate relief so far as prices are concerned,
so it becomes necessary for the thrifty housewife to learn economies whereby the
table and the home may be suppled at a figure within the family income.
Short cuts must be devised, cheap dishes that are wholesome and toothsome
must be discovered; money must be saved, but not at the cost of household effi
ciency. The problem is a big one.
The Telegraph has engaged the well-known writer, Mrs. Anna Hamilton
Wood, to make a study of conditions in Harrisburg and to write her views for the
benefit of the housewives of this city. The first articles will appear in a few days.

Expect Allies to Make Their

Virtual completion of the Teutonic
conquest of Little Wallachia Is an

Turnu Severln, on the Danube, have
been captured by the Austro-German
forces which have broken the resist
ance of the Rumanians in this section
of Western Rumania.
No mention is made of the booty
taken or of the fate of the Rumanian
forces which were defending the Os
sova region. The retreat of these
forces is assumed to have been cut off
with the recent capture by General
von Falkenhayn's armies of Craiova
and with it the only main line railroad
leading eastward.
Pushing eastward front the Jiul val
ley after their capture of Craiova, the
Austro-German forces are now an
nounced as approaching the Alt valley.
It is along this valley that the Ru
manians apparently have elected to
make their next stand. Bucharest yes
terday reported a withdrawal of the
Rumanians from the Jiul region and
announced that they were holding
their own in the Alt valley, where a
Teutonic force is driving from the
northern Rumanian border in a con
verging attack with the forces from
the west.
Bulgarians Oil Move
Simultaneously a , movement has
been made, presumably by the Bul
garians, which may prove of notable
importance. Bucharest reports an at

successful, would mean a cutting in

Clark Act Is Contention
of City Fathers
City Council, 'tis said, isri't a wee bit
enthusiastic about Mayor Meals' new
police code.
The rules cover a multitude of
things—nearly as varied a list of them
as the walrus once discussed—but the
City Commissioners aren't a bit favor
ably inclined toward adopting them
as they sland.
The regulations were laid over for
printing so that they can be taken up
one by one at Tuesday's meeting. And
among other things' that will require
decided revision, so eouncllmen de
clare. is that initial paragraph which
prescribes the duties of the chief of
police.
In brief, the rules provide that the
chief shall be the sole head of the
department; that he has to do the
"hirin" and flrin' " of cops, etc.: shall
prescribe all the rules and regulations
for the department—in other words,
the r hi"f is to he boss.
Which just can't he. say eouncllmen;

Hence the revision.
