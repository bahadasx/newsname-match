NUMBER 27
DISTRICT FORESTER
IS INVESTIGATING
FOREST HIGHWAY
Has Conference With Board of Super
visors and Taxpayers' and Leaves
for Personal Inspection of Proposed
Route Between Clifton and Springer
ville
That the proposed Clifton-Springerville
Forest Highway, to be built on
the co-operative plan by the taxpayers
of Greenlee county and the Depart
ment of Agriculture, at an estimated
cost of $375,000, is receiving the earn
est consideration of the Forest offi
cials in this district, was again evi
denced this week when Forest Super
visor Frederick Winn, of Springerville
and District Forester P. G. Reddlng
ton arrived in Clifton.
While other minor affairs occupied
the attention of the Forest Officials
while here, their most Important mis
sion was a conference with the mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors, offi
cials of the Greenlee County Chamber
of Commerce, and large- taxpayers of
the district, at the conclusion of which
they departed for a five days' trip
over the proposed route leading north
from Clifton through the Apache
Forest Reservation.
Under the terms of the Act passed
oy Congress during the last session,
appropriating ten million- dollars dur
ing the period of the next ten years,
for highway construction with forest
reservations under a co-operative plan
with states and counties, it is incum-
Dent upon the District Forester, Mr
Reddington, to make recommenda
tions to the Secretary of Agriculture
in favor of those projects, which
after a careful investigation, can be
recommended as meeting the full re
quirements of the Act, viz., develop
ment of the forest resources ana toe
general good of the communities adja
cent. For the purpose of making such an
investigation at first nana Mr. Kea
dington is on the ground.
Seven applications for participa
tion in the appropriation allotted to
the FrrrarttB rfi -' "' . have been
Teceived by Mr. Reddington from Ari
zona communities, and while on-
commital on what his recommenda
tions may be on January 1, the fact
that he is looking over the Clifton-
Soringervilie Highway in person, au
gurs well for favorable consideration
at his hands
It is "safe to assert that no other
section of Arizona offers more advan
tages to all parties concerned than
that afTorded by connecting the im
mense virgin forest on our northern
boundary with the producing Clifton-
Morenci mining district by the means
of this proposed connecting highway
link between Springerville and Clifton.
Another strong argument in favor of
this proposed highway is the splendid
spirit of co-operation manifested by
our Board of Supervisors and the
heaviest taxpayers in the district.
Mr. Reddington spent - Wednesday
to Clifton 'and during the afternoon
in company with W. T. Witt, Chair
man of the Board of Supervisors,
Frederick Winn, Forest Supervisor, J.
A. Adams, Forest Ranger, W. B.
Kelly, President of the Greenlee Cham
ber of Commerce and W. S. Eradfield,
Secretary, called upon Mr. Sforman
Carmichael, General Manager of the
Arizona Copper Company, Ltd., who
has evidenced a keen interest in' the
proposed Clifton-SpringerviHe High
way since its inception. Mr. Car
michael assured Mr. Reddington. that
personally he was heartily in favor of
the co-operative plan evolved between
the Board of Supervisors and the
Forest Department and gave it as his
opinion that a bond issue for this pur
pose would be voted by the taxpayers
of the county.
On Thursday morni Mr. Redding
ton left for the northern boundary of
the Apache Forest anl expects to re
turn to Clifton on Monday afternoon.
During his trip he will be present at
the installation of a wireless tele
graph station at the Baseline Station
on the Blue which it is hoped will
prove a succes and enable communica
tion between Clifton and the Blue
station. Mr. Ray Potter, of Clif
ton, accompanied the party to assist
in its installation. There are two
amateur wireless stations in Clifton
which can work with the Blue station.
And if the experiment proves a suc
cess the wireless system will he in
stalled in other forests throueh- t th
United States now ' without comrcKP''
It C2n be stated that every
tion points to favorable consideration
by the Department of Agriculture of
the Clifton-Springerville Highway, one
of the greatest projects for the pros
perity of this district, and the develop
ment of our forest resources, yet ad
vanced .

CAUSES THAT LED TO
ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION
The editor of the Prescott Courier,
never at any time a fanatic or extrem
ist on any proposition, gives the rea
son of the large popular vote for abso
lute prohibition as follows:
"The fact, that Arizona has gone
wholly and -completely dry can be at
tributed most largely io the open and
brazen defiance of the law by men
who should have known that such
could be the only result of such a law
less course. It threw into the ranks
of the prohibition fanatics hundreds of
men who hold first to the enforcement
of the law and next to minor oues -
tions, and we hold to the enforcement
of the law and the upholding of the
hands of aM persons and officers
seeking the law's enforcement. We
still believe that regulation of the
proper kind will prove more effective
than prohibition, and we voted to!
maintain the situation lust as it was
under the personal use decision. But
for the flagrant and defiant violation
of the Ihw we mirht have voted other-

BOOZE SHIPPED III
NOW WILL NOTBE
Liquors shipped in how will not -
Persons who are in possession of in
toxicating liquors ' at the time Gover-"
nor Hunt proclaims the new prohibi
tion amendment will not be molested
This announcement was made yester
day by T. K. Marshall, president of
the state temperance federation. -. '
Mr. Marshall's announcement fol
lowed a series of rumors, which gain
ed wide circulation, that the prohibi
tion advocates in Tucson were plan
ning to make raids on the hotels and
restaurants of the city which have
had a large amount of wine stored
since the state went dry as well as
upon all of the homes of the city
where it was suspected that a bottle
ot "personal use" might be found. :
"I will use all the force at my com
mand to prevent any person who gets
liquor before the amendment becomes
a law from being bothered," said Mr.
Marshall. "I think to interfere with
any man who gets liquor before the
amendment is in force would be plain
ly against the law.'"
Mr. Marshall sail '.Le report that
the prohibition forces planned ' to
r&id the express office and seize the
shipments there also was without
foundation. "We would have no right
to take anything that comes in
before the law prohibits it, and we
do not plan anything sensational any
way." :.
Mr.' Marshall added that he had told
several people,, who came to him fnr
information, that they would be safe
ir. ordering liquor for their persona'
use. .;
it is charged by Mr. Marshal that
anti-prohibitionistd are responsible
for te delay in the official count In
Cochise county. ile says he believes
it is a trick to foice Gover ior Hunt
to d- ! y his proclamation so as . to
Mt'.ow more tims for "pi sonal use"
