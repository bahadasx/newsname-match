Without allowing for any special gain in the value of the silver
content, and, comparing It with previous shipments this year, the
Tonopah Belmont sent out today one of the heaviest consignments
of bullion that has been sent away from Tonopah. From the Tono
pah mill 56 bars weighing 109,060 ounces were sent out, while from
the Millers plant another 27 bars weighing 51,549 ounces were
picked up. This total of 160,609 ounces Is valued at ,136,517.65 on
the old appraisement of 85 cents an ounce that has been continued 1
since silver passed the 60 'cent mark. It is apparent at a glance
that the intrinsic value of the shipment is much more than these
figures, as it is estimated that the Joint gold and Silver contents
would represent more like a dollar an ounce. "4
