IN KANSAS ('ITV
It was explained to-night that the
question of choosing a test case had
been put in the hands of the attor

lack of sufficient information here to
warrant an agreement on this point.
The Joint congressional committee
investigating the subject of transpor
tation began its work in earnest to
day, with A. P. Thorn, counsel for the
railway executives' advisory committee,
speaking for two hours and a half on
railroad problems of the day. Me will
continue to-morrow, and may not end
his argument before the end of the
week.
Mr. Thorn went into many phases
! of railroad conditions, but dwelt par
! ticularly on their need for credit, if
they arc t>> extend and keep trans
! portation facilities up to the standard
the public demands. lie said that in
the last sixteen years the percentage
of railroad securities constituting liens
against the property had increased
' from about -19 per cent to about ?>.">
j per cent of the total securities, and
' predicted that financiers who would
come before the committee later would
j testify that the danger line had been
reached. The investing public. Mr.
Thom said, demanded a t'. per cent re
i turn and a ." per cent surplus fund
yearly to provide against lean years.
' and such return is almost impossible
on railroad stocks under present condi
tions. He pointed out that Kurope
j not only has ceased to take American
j railway stocks, but is selling back
< hundreds of millions of those once
owned, and that the new money to
keep the roads going, t?? extend them
1 and to open up vast undeveloped fields,
! must come from the American people,
who are now unwilling to invest.
"If government ownership of rail
roads comes in this country," said Mr.
Thom. "it will he because of the need
of credit which private owners cannot
supply."
III.A M KS I'HKSr.NT SVSTIMI

Mr. Thom blamed the present system
of "corrective" regulation, divided be
tween the State and Federal govern
j men is. for most of the problems troub
ling the public and the carriers, and
! appealed for a discussion of necessary
j changes "not upon any mere theory or
j jealousy as to the distribution of gov
ernmental power, but upon the large
? issue of what public Interest requires."
Kates, Mr Thom declared, are less
! important to public interest than "cer
j tainty. safety and sufficiency of trans
? portation."
1'nder present conditions, in which
"the railroad business is largely ??on
trolled by political instead of business
considerations," he added, railroad
credit is so poor and returns so small
that adequate extensions of lines into
undeveloped territory and enlargement
of facilities are impossible. He said
I increased transportation facilities
j would tend to reduce the cost of living

I causing increased production.
Mr. Thom pointed out that the pres

It was contended by City Attorney
Pollard, on behalf of the city, that a
rate of taxation to be followed by local

erty as is expressly segregated and
made subject to State taxation only, i
and that the same act provides that '
capital of merchants shall not be sub
ject to State taxation, but may be taxed
locally as prescribed by law.
In disposing of this contention and ?
in explanation of the meaning of the
ad. the court has this to say:
"Now the State taxes the capital of

chases. calling it a license, and the :
purpose of the language relied on was

"Apart from the manifest desire and !

j order thereby to induce more general

i about uniformity in the rate of tax1

onu as the State continued to tax !

JUAREZ, November -3.?Three times
; to-day Francisco Villa attacked the
' lirsl-llne trenches which defend Chl

j repulsed, leaving liis dead and wounded
011 the plains outside of the city to
the south, reports to military head
quarters received by General Gonzales
here from the besieged city said.
At 11 o'clock A. .M. to-day (mountain
time) the high-crowned hats of the
bandits 'v. ere seen to the south along
the Mexican Central mail line, accord
ing t?> these messages. The battle was
opened a few minutes later with a
salvo from cannon on Santa Itosa llill,
the key to the state capital. The tlrst
and second-line trenches, protected by
barbed-wire entanglements, took up the
lighting, and by noon a general en
gagement was in progress along the
entire southern line, which continued
through the early tifternoou. At that
time the bombing of large-caliber guns
011 Santa Itosa llill and other artillery
stationed along the tirst-line trenches
was so deafening that it was almost
impossible to hear the click of the
telegraph instruments, the military op
erator in Chihuahua City told the op
erator in Juarez,

WITH GOVIOUNMK.VT KOHCIiS
At 3 o'clock the battle was still
raging, the apparent advantage being
with the government forces. Villa is
reported by General Gonzales to have
at least 3.500 men, practically all of
whom are armed and mounted. He is
also believed to have machine guns,
but no heavy artillery. For this rea
son, the twenty or more heavy field
guns of General Trevino's command
were able to rako the advancing lines
of Villa bandits, the messages from the
state capital stated.
The tleld was covered with dead and'
dying men, one message stated.
A sortie by Carranza cavalry, sup
ported by artillery, resulted in the cap
ture of many Villa prisoners, who were
without ammunition, and had gone
since morning without food and water,
another message declared.
Carranza's ollicers here are opti
mistic regarding the outcome of the
battle at Chlhjahua City. The only
cause of worry to them is the fact that
General Trevino's ammunition supply
for small arms and machine guns is
limited. However. the supply of
artillery shells is ample, it is said here,
to keep the bandits away from the
city.

; Through an error in a message early
in the day. General Francisco Murguia
was located at Mapula, twelve tidies
south of Chihuahua City, and the hopes
of Carranza officers for an early re
enforcement of the garrison there were
raised. Later, however, it was found
the message referred to Villa, Instead
of Murguia, who was said to be at
Santa Rosalia, some distance south.

General Trevino's artillery, which
carried 1 lie brunt of the attack, did
heavy execution in the ranks of the
bandits, according to the message (Jen

the Slate capital. Many Villa pris
oners were taken by the Carranza
forces when a detachment of infantry
and cavalry made a sally from the city,
he said.
Villa in person was leading his
forces against the Carranza troops, ac
cording to the reports received a' the
Juarez military headquarters from
Chihuahua City, given out by Car
ranza ollicers. The bandit leader was
said to be riding horseback, with his
crutch strapped to his saddle. He wan
said by the de facto authorities to
have approximately 3,500 men In his
main column. As he is reported to
have more than fi.OOO troops under his
command, the remainder of the bandits
are believed to be advancing to re
enforce their chief.
