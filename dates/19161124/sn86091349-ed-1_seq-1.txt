A legislative program involving
some changes and some additions
to Nevada laws, was considered yes
terday afternoon at a meeting of
the state board of the Nevada Wom
en's Civic league. The legislative
program is the same as the program
adopted at the state con
vention of the league in April.
Among other things it recommends
the raising of the age of consent
from' 16 to 18 years; recommends
a modification of the race track,
gambling and divorce laws; asks that
a law be passed that will provide for
the use of schools as civic centers;
recommends an eight-hour law for
women; favors the passage of a law
that will give the wife control of her
own earnings and also a community
property law.
It was decided at the meeting yes
terday that the league should make
every effort at the next session of the
legislature to have the laws pased.

Word was received in Pioche sev

resident of this city. The remains
were shipped to Davenport, Iowa,
for interment.

From time to time we read that
the comptroller jof the currency or

price of silver settle on the dictum when the strugle to rob the world
of any United States treasury of- ( of half Its money began. Less than
flclaP We had thought that th two hundred men in London and In
power of fixing the price wm In th Nw York were in tb conspiracy.
It has cost the country at large much
more directly, while the indirect
cost never can be estimated. Aside
from what It has done at home, It
has driven our trans-Pacific steamers
from the Pacific and practically
killed our export trade with three-
of the inhabitants of the
During the great war the people
payable in specie.
The next step was to try to de
stroy half the specie. This, too,
when the interest bearing debt of
the government and of the corpora
tions of the country amounted to
more than 4,000 millions of dollars
and when half the area of our coun
try was a wilderness to be redeemed.
This was accomplished through
the treachery and square lying of a
few men In high stations in Wash
ington., who were under oath to serve
their country faithfully.
Then silver, measured by gold,
began to fall in value, silver from
the first had been the steadier metal
of the two and that had never tall
en one penny In value so long as It
had the same recognition as gold.
But at the same time the proper
ty of all kinds of men began to
fall in the same ratio, but while this
was perfectly apparent and thousands
of men were being ruined month
ly the people could not see it. But
when the truth was told them they
refused to listen, and with an as
sumed superior Integrity declared j
that they did not desire to pay their
debts in the half-weight dollars of
the thieving silver miners. Sueh
fools these mortals be.

Finally, when the buslnes of theJ
country was in extremity, a great)
crop at home and famine the outside!
world around, brought to us in two;
years a surplus of 2,000 millions of j
dollars, and business revived. j,
Then came the great unexpected
gold discoveries of Cripple Creek,.
Hip Tinnd and Australia. i
Business would have righted up
and moved on an even keel, but the
little coterie of gold men in New
York always held their clamps upon
it. They brought on the panic of
1907, and full soon it was made clear'
that their work had killed our ex-f
ports to the Orient, demoralized our
exchanges with Spanish America,
and southern Europe; but those gold.
