WASHINGTON. D P. . Nu 9d
James L. Coke of Honolulu was today
appointed by President Wilton as
third judge of the circuit court, first

Immediately the congratulations be
gan to pour in on the popular attor
; . ney: , -:
Many weeks ago the Star-Bulletin
v. I.VHUU! wii l ij c uoaia
of authoritative news from Washlng
. ton. It has been understood for some
time that he was the choice of the
attorney general's department, which
had recommended him to the presi
dent, and that the only bar to his ap
pointment was the fact that he was a

to the recent territorial elections.
However, the wording of the Organic
Act maintained his disability for his
official -terra." This term, it has
M..I.I.Al t. . a . .
ewueuuy ueea ceia Dy tne authorities
In Washingtqn, ended when his suc
cessor was elected, that is, at the re
mil fccuciai cicvuuu.
It is therefore conjectured that as
soon as the president returned to
Washington and took up a mass of
official tasks demanding his attention
just after election the appointment
or tne Hawaii Jurist was definitelj
settled and today's recess appoint
ment followed.
The appointment will come before
the next session for confirmation, but
there is no question but that it wil:
be confirmed. Coke has many strong
friends in Congress, besides the back
ing of the attorney general's depart
ment.
He takes the place left vacant when
Judge T. B. StuarY resigned, accom
panying hit resignation with the now
famous letter severely criticizing the
president. Secretary Lane, Governor
Pinkham and others.
Has Been Long In Hawaii
James L, Coke has been a resi
dent of the Island for nearly 19 years
He came from Coos Bay, Ore., wherf
he had taken two years' study at the
University of Oregon, and completer
his law work by private study, later
being admitted to practise before the
supreme court of the state.
After he was here a short time he
went to Maui in the latter part o!
1898 and remained there for 11 years
He served on Maul as prosecuting and
county attorney . with success. Com
ing to Honolulu in 1903, he began
practise. In 1912 he was elected to
the territorial senate, leading thv
Democratic ticket with one of the
biggest votes ever given on Oahu. He
served -to) terms In the senate, re
signing as previously related.
He has recently been serving as at
torney for the public utilities commis
slon.
Mr. Coke is 41 years of age one of
the youngest judges in the territory
and married. He is a member of sev
eral clubs, societies and fraternal or
ders and a popular citizen.
"One of the gratifying things about
rcy appointment," he commented to
day, ia that everybody tells me It
has met general favor."
It is probable that he will be direct
ed by cable or mail to qualify at once.
Early this afternoon Mr. Coke re
ceived a ;. telegram from Attorney
General Gregory, saying that the pres
ident today signed the commission
naming Coke as judge.

at first planned in answer to criticisms
of the territorial school system, re
ceived by him last Monday morning.
"I acknowledged receipt of the let
ter In a formal note," said the execu

be of considerable Interest to College
Club members as well as other citi
zens of Honolulu as the answer has
been awaited eagerly since the gov
ernor first announced lhat he would
send It after he had had time to study
It completely. Superintendent Kinney
also announced that he would reserve

The work of the regiment Thursday
was very interesting, both from the
viewpoint of the troops 'who partici
pated and also from that of specta
tors, as it consisted of the capturing
of trenches by the three battalions,
and afterwards consolidating and hold
ing them against counter attacks. In
the morning each battalion leader was
told that In a certain direction an
enemy was entrenched, the positions
being designated by flags. Soon each
battalion found the enemy and with
yells charged up the hill, the last fifty
yards being made with fixed bayonets.
The imaginary opposing force was
finally forced to retreat after a spirit
ed engagement and the trenches tak

In the afternoon they returned and

Payment of Bonuses Occasion
For Rejoicing; $40,000
Distributed Today
A veritable shower of gold was
poured yesterday,' and is being pour
ed today, into the hands of the hun
dreds of laborers at Ewa plantation
as bonuses in addition to their regu
lar wages for the year. The payments
will be completed tomorrow.
At the plantations the payment days
have been virtually holidays and there
is rejoicing and jollification among
the laborers. Yesterday about $50,
000 was distributed among 500 laborers
and today a like number are being
paid approximately 140,000. It Is es
timated that tomorrow the payments
will run up to $75,000 and that about
1000 laborers will receive their bonuses.'.-
" The children, perhaps, are the ones
who are exhibiting the greatest enjoyr
ment from the liberal . bonus system.
Plantation officers today pointed out
that some of the boys and girls, Span
ish and Portuguese, are receiving bo
nuses amounting to as much as $40
and $50. These children are planta
tion workers. Some of them work
continually while others work only
during the vacation time.
"The little Spanish and Portuguese
girls are very happy," one plantation
officer said when communicated with j
by telephone. "They love finery, pret
ty dresses, neat shoes and show hats.
There is fcund to be a raid on the
plantation store after the payments
are all made and an S. O. S. call may
have to be sent to Honolulu for more
frocks and shoes."
The work of paying the bonuses is
progressing quietly and without mis
hap and in no instance has any dis
satisfaction been shown. In fact, it
is pointed out. the laborers appear ex-:
ceedingly gratified. Waialua planta-j
tion also is paying bonuses today.

SAILORS' WAGES
Japanese Say Part of Increase
Asked For Has Been Given;
Officials Are Silent
In Japanese, sources It was said to
day that the Iriter-Island has granted
the petition of - Its Japanese . sailors
for a further increase of pay.
As the story was told a Japanese
reporter of the Star-Bulletin this morn
ing, the steamship company put the
raise into effect today, and will from
now on pay its Japanese sailors $1.70
per day instead of $1.45, also give the
men an inereasftt of 10. cents, an hour
overtime pay above the old rate for
overtime work.
Nearly a month ago the sailors
asked the Inter-Island to raise their
wages from $1.45 to $2 a day and to
grant them 50 cents an hour for over
time. "'
This week about 20 of the Japanese
walked out because the Increase had
not been forthcoming. The majority
of the company's Asiatic sailors, how
ever, stayed with the .company.
Norman E. Oedge, acting general
manager of the Inter-Island, when told
of the reported raise, would neither
confirm nor deny it. He said he might
have a statement to make late this
afternoon.
A conference was held from 11:30
until shortly after aoon today, between
the acting manager and .lames H.

sailors' representative in the nego
tiations between the men and the
steamship corporation..

ELECTIONS HAD
UTILE REARING
ON SUGAR DUTY
Not Even Changes in House
and Senate to Cause Re- ;
vision of Tariff
By C. S. ALBERT
(Special Star-Bulletin Correspondence)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 12.
The status of sugar promises to re
main unchanged as a result of the re
cent elections. The only chance for a
better protective duty hinged on a
complete reversal of conditions. This
required the election of a Republican
president, senate and house. Not one
cf these expectations has been realized
though the house will probably be
slightly Republican. '-;.
Although control of the house may
be In doubt, it is a safe assumption
that the" Democrats, Socialists and
other minor factions will dominate.
With the disaffection of such Demo
crats as favor higher rates for sugar
it might be possible to pass a measure
in that body restoring the terms of the
Payne-Aldrich act.
The process of remedial legislation
would stop right there. The senate
seems to be certainly 54 Democrats to
42 Republicans. Allowing that four
Democrats, including the two senators
from Louisiana, would cooperate with
the Republicans there would be no
possibility of favorable action. Even
if a miracle could be performed the
president's veto would still constitute
an impossible barrier to success.
Tariff legislation in which sugar
would be benefited seems entirely out
of the question. The Democrats are
disposed to let the Underwood
Simmons law work out its own salva
tion until the present European war
Is ended. Beyond that point no one
can make predictions and escape the
insane asylum.
The only possib!e juggling with
sugar might arise in connection with
the necessity for additional revenues
to keep the governmental wheels re
volving. This would not come in the
form of restoring the remainder of
the Payne-Aldrich rates. It would
take the form of a consumer's tax.
This would be collected at the refin
eries and be paid by the consumer
purchasing the refined product for
retailing. A mite would be contrib
uted by all those using sugar as a
necessity or luxury.
The imposition of a consumer's tax
on sugar was much discussed during
the last session of Congress. It was
thrown aside because of great unpopu
larity. It will not be brought up ex
cept in the last extremity.
. Hence, the sugar planter must fig
ure on the present without much ref
erence to the future. No hope Is held
out for the producers of Ioulsiana.
The existing status seems certain to
remain unchanged unless . monetary
necessities make some additional. form
of taxation essential. .
