Lower Potato
Rate (or N. D.
Potato Growers of. North Dakota
Can Now Ship Spuds to
Three Markets— Means
Better Markefts
Ward Co. Independent: The
Minot Association of Commerce
has at last succeeded in securing
a new potato rate to the Pacific
coast via l'he Great Northern
Railway*
The only potato rate up to this
time 'was 92 1*2 cents per 100
pounds—nearly one cent a pound.
As a-consequence potatoes have
always been shipped east and
south, the growers taking what
ever the dealers there would give
them. For a long time North Da
kota grown potatoes have been
used for seed as far south as
Texas and as far east as Indiana
and Ohio. But upon a number
of occassions the North Dakota
growers have come out at the
short end of tlie hornt because
when they arrived in Kansas
City or Chicago the market was
way off, and they look a loss. In
order to tnen up another mar
ket the Minot association of Com
merce undertook to seeure a low
er rate to the Pacific coast, so
that another outlet would be gain
ed for our growers. This effort
has been crowned with success
at last.
During the Panama-Pacific-In
ternational Exposition at San
Francisco. Larimore, this state,
put on a baked potato day, and
right after the event the market
for NorlEi Dakota spuds was
ready and waiting, but the
freight rate wvfi prohibitive- Cal*
ifornians never ate such good po
tatoes before, and they wanted
them bad, because they tickled
the palate of the most particular
potato epicure.
The Association of Commerce
has maintained all along tfie 75c
per 100 pounds was an ample
rate, for the main shipment of
spuds from this state to the coast
would occur when the fruit ship
ment was eastward, and the rail
way company, instead of send
ing fruit car «v$t empty thoy
hate been do .ij oukl h- a'l:
to haul them loaded with
the best potatoes that grow. This
week the Secretary of the
asso­
ciation receiv'ti l! re»v tariff,
which provides for the rate of
75c per 100 pounds between
points in 'Minnesota, South and
North Dakota to San Francisco.
California. 'Phis tariff provides
the following: Potatoes, includ
ing sweet potatoes, carload, min
imum weight 30,000. No charge
"will be made for stoves and lin
ing used to protect carload ship
ments from October 1st to May
1st, the maximum allowance in
weight therefore to be 1400
pounds. Stoves and lining so
used will be returned free to
original point of /shipment.
This new rate goes into effect
December 3rd, and while it may
not affect ipments this year, it
will have a great bearing on ship
ments in the future.
The Association of Commerce
suggested that in making ship
ments to San Francisco or inter
mediate points, that the potatoes
be graded as to weight and color,
wrapped and packed in regular
apple boxes. In this way the top
price for fjjie potatoes can be se
cured. for people nowadays like
their eatables put' up in neat con­
dition.
The Association of Commerce
does not consider its work done
in the matter of this new pota
to rate, and the organization
stands ready at all times to co.
operate with all growers in the
part of the state who desire to
(hip west instead of the low mar
ket in the east and south, which
fluctuates so much.
Potatoes in Ohio at the present
time are selling for $2.50 per
bushel. Good potatoes on the
coast will bring that much or
more, and if packed in the right
manner there is no limit to the
price that can be secured for
fancy stock. Baked potatoes in
San Francisco sell at from 20c
apiece upwards, so it can be seen
that 'the market will be a good
one.

8-Hour Law
Unconstitutional
Lawyers Push Matter With Speed
Seldom Witnessed in
Court of Law.
Kansas Citp, Mo., Nov., 24—
Judge Wm, C. Hook, in the
United States district court here,
eld the Adamson eight-hour law
unconstitutional today, but made
it plain that his decision was not
based on mature consideration of
ihe merits of the case but on ex
pediency desired by all parties at
interest because of tthe necessity
of a final dcision by the supreme
court of the United States before
Jan. 1 next, when the law goes
into effect.
The legal moves in the process
of consigning l'he problem direct
to the highest court of the land
where some-what involved from
the lay point of view, but the
lawyers concerned rushed the
matter thru with a speed seldom
witnessed in the courts of law.
Gregory's Course Secret.
Just vUiat action Attorney Gen
eral Gregory would take remained
a closely guarded secret until yes
terday when Frank Haberman,
retained as special counsel to re
present the federal government in
the Adamson law cases, suddenly
set the ball rolling by asking
Ilook to instruct the receiver for
I lie Missouri. Oklahoma & Gulf
railroad, complainant in an Ad
amson law injunction suit, to join
with the defendants in proceed
ings which would consign the
case on its merits to the supreme
court.

were instructed,to notify counsel
for all railroads of the moves
made here and to invite them to
join in the case before the su.
preme court.
The present case, in the view
of Mr, Hagerman, provides all
of the factors necessary for a
test case, but it was said by James
Dunlap, of the legal staff of t'he
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
that among lawyers, there is some
difference of opinion on this
point. He said that in some quar
ters it was thought that perhaps
one or two additional test cases
should be brought to afford a
wider range of inquiry and anal
ysis.
