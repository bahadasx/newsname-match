Lehigh Valley Head Declares
Big Producers Are Not to
Blame.
GIVES THREE REASONS.
Desire to Fill Bins, Insufficient
Labor and Broken Miners'
Agreements.
Thrp la no Justification for New
Vorker.i being charged 110 or 112 ptr
ton for coal. II. II. Thomas. President
of the l,"hlL'li Vnlloy Railnm I Com
pany, made tl.ls declaration to. day
that put nil the coal boosters In the
class of extortionist. Mr. Thomas,
was ono of tho Big Four of tho coal ,
world whom The Evening World, In j
Its editorial columns to-day, called on i
to stand by tho public. In reply, Mr.
Thomas Issued tho following ntate-1
ment:
"The Lehigh Valley Coal Company1
1o In no way tesponslblo for the pres
ent high rrio-o of coal In New York
City.
"I do not hesitate to ssy that there
is no justification for a charno of $10
or $12 a ton for anthracite.
"To tho best of my knowledgn nnd
belief none of the largo producing
companies has Increased tho prlco of
anthracite beyond that necessary to
take caro of the new wage agreement
effective April 1, 191C, an Increase
wholly Insignificant In comparison
with ,i $10 or J12 retail prlco In Now
Vork City.
"1 hnvo stated before nnd I deslrt
to lepent that statement with em
phasis that there are threo reasons
for the abnormal conditions jn the
City of New York. Theno reasons
arc:
"1- Tho evident desire of the
public to till Its coal bins nil lit
once, having failed to pui chase
tlio customary amount of coal
during the summer months.
"2. An insufficient supply of la
bor to produce a suttlclcnt amount
of coal to tnko caro of tho ab
normal demand.
"II. The absolute refusal of tho
miners to respect their tiBieeiiicut
with the operators, which pro.
vldcs that they shnll work eight
hours n dny, six days a week, ex
cepting only legal holidays.
"During the ten mouths period
ending Sept. 30. 1310, there haa been
an Increased production of anthracite
of 660,673 tons, whlcn increased pro
duction tumlshes conclusive evidence
that thero Is not a serious coal short
age, all it ports and statements to the
contrary notwithstanding.
"Thf Lehigh V.ilh j Coal Company
has nothing whatever to do with th'
retail prlco of coal In the City of .Vv
York. Under the terms of tho coin
modules clause of tho Interstate Com
merco net, the company Is prohlhite I
from engaging In Interstate commerc
and In strict compliance with the
terms of that act every pound of co.ii
produced by tlu company is sold at
tho mouth of the mine.
"Aa to the Lehigh Valloy Coal Sales
Company, In which company neither
the Lehigh Valley Railroad as a cor
poration nor myself as an Individual,
have a dollar's worth of stock.
"It Is utterly beyond the power of
the Company to say, or even suggest,
at what price that coal should bo sold
In New York City, To do so would
be a violation of the Foderal Stat
utes," The Lehigh Valley Railroad owns
and controls tho Lehigh Valley Coal
Company, which is Ita mlno operating
organization. When tho railroads
wero compellod to separate tholr coal
mining nnd coal carrying business
the Lehigh Valley Coal Sains Com
pany, a separate and distinct corpor
ation, way formed to piire.hH and
maiket tho output.
While some of the stockholders of
the railroad company aro stnckhold
ers In the sales company, tho two
ciiiKerns are otlh-Ully, at lejsi, not
under the same management or con
trol. Tho railroad company after celling
the coal at a fixed prlto at the mouth
of the mlno, disclaims all further re
sponsibility for price and dlatrttmtloa.

Braemer Castle Destroyed in
Aegean Sea 60 .Wiles Erom
Where Britannic Sank.
LONDON, Nov. 2l.-riK British hos
pltal ship Braomor CaMlc, of ,2S0
tons gross, hound from Salonlea to
Malta with wounded, has ben mined
or torpedoed In tho Aegean Sen, It
was officially announced to-day. All
on board were saved.
Tho disaster occurred In the My.
konl Channel, sixty mllea from the
'.cn, whero on Tuesday the hospital
ship Britannic was sunk by a mine.
A Router despatch from Athens
.-ays tho Braemer Castle nns torpo
doed. A virtual disavowal that a Herman
hiibmarlno had anything to do with
tho sinking Is contained In a wireless
despatch lecelved to-day from Ilor
lln, which rpads as follow:
"According to the reports so far
at hand the Britannic was pro
reeding trom Uiigland to Salonlea.
For a Journey In this direction
the large number of persons on
board was extraordinarily strik
ing and Justifies a strong sus
picion of the misuse of a hospital
ship for transport purposes.
"Inasmuch as tho ship born the
distinguishing marks of a hospital
ship In accordance with regula
tions thero can naturally be no
question of u German suhmurlno
in connection with tho sinking."
All the New York evening
paper yesterday printed a story
cabled to London from Athens
by a British correspondent, de
claring, that the Britannic had
been torpedoed and sunk by a
submarine. The correspondent
declared that two U boati fired
torpedoes. This story was psned
by the British censor, and no inti
mation was sent from London
until last cvenlna that it had been
officially announced that the hos
pital ship w actually tunli by
mine.
