PRESENT PENDING REVENUE
DILL. ,
Address by Mr. F. E. Butler, of the
Law Department of Valparaiso Uni
versity, before the members of the
"Emanon Club":
Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Emanon Club:
I have selected for my subject this
evo, one of the most Important and vi
tal problems before the American na
tion today, a problem which should
' and does concern eveiy person who
lives within the borders of our great
- United SUtes. My remarks will be
: in respect to the "Presen: Pending
I Revenue Bill," with especial emphasis
I on that section entitled: To provide
I for d tax upon all pcijons, firms or
como rations ens-aired in Interstate
mail-order business."
The pending bill la indeed, the most
complete and exhaustive bill concern
ing revenues ever brought before a
Conercts. I wish I had time to go
Into It thoroughly and po:nt out In
detail its many important features,
but since my time isx so limited, I
feel that the best possible mariner in
which to deal with this sujject is ij
devote my remarks to tiie section per
taining to "Interstate mail-order bus
iness". Now, this bill propines to tax
mail-order 'houses doing an interstate
business. It provides that any peí
. son or corporation conducting an in
ter state mail-order business for the
purpose of selling goods, wares and
merchandise dirrct to the consumer
Shall pay a tax of one (1) per cent,
upon the total cash va:ue o.' its sales
within any state.
It further provides that the mount
of the tax hall be ascertained by the
Secretary of the Treasury, who shall
compel the mail-order houses to report
the gross amount of goods sold by
them In each state.
The hill also provides that the Us
collected by the government shall be
apportioned to the respective States
in the ratio of the actual amount of
P goods sold In each sUte.
Almost every other business has
been Uxad heavily to raise funds to
meet the tremendous expenditures of
the government. The iocal, sute and
national governments are levying Ul
es upon the people In many different
ways. The national government ia,
in my opinion, infringing upon the
prerogative of the sUle In collecting
Uses from the people of the various
state, which la practically resulting
in double Uxation. Why exempt the
mail-order houses from Uxation Y
Why not make them aUnd their ahare
if of tfhi gre'. Ux burden T
If the revenue bill should go Into
effort without this provision it would !
mean that every- sUte In the union
would pay more money to the United
SUtes government than it Ukes to
t ' tin the whole aUU government, ana
rUFport.its institutions.
The large mail-order houses are
doing milions of dollars a year busi
ness throughout every state, and yet,
they contribute nothing toward the
support of any sUte or local gov
ernment outside of the placea wher
they are located, and then they con-
tribuU only a trifle compared with
the amount of business they do.
There are at present over one thou
sand mail-order houses In the UniUd
SUtes doing, it is estimated, about
one billion dollars worth of business
annually.
It Is not the object of this bill to
put the' mall-order houses out of bus
iness, it Is simply a measure to make
them pay their ust share of the Uxea
1 per cent of their gross sales.
The mall-order house keeps In stock
only a sample of the great list of ar
ticles that it sella, and ha (U con
tract with the manufacturer of the
articles to send the same direct to the
consumer when he mall order hou
obtain a customer and semis the or
der. In VhU way, the mall arder
house runs no risk of goods getting
shopworn, and all the tax that It pays
is on these" samples which It has In
stock, which Is a very small Ux in
proportion to the business it does.
It employs the minimum amount of
help, and I might IncidenUlly add,
pays a minimum wage, and is general
ly located so that It pays small rent,
since a good location is of little value
or concern to a business selling thru
the mails.
The mail-order house is making
more money today than most any
business institution and without any
responsibilities or obligation to the
thousands of communities where it
conducts iu business in competition
with the local merchants. In fact, it
Is the beneficiary of more favors from
the United SUtes government than
any private Institution, and yet, it
pays only a -trifle toward the support
of the government.
The Ute and local communities
have no power to deal with an Institu
tion doing an IntersUU business. The
Federal government alone has the
power and can and should meet the
problem.
You know, the transient merchant
or peddler is compelled to Uke out
SUte and local licenses before he ran
do business in any totality. The jus
tice of such a law is recognised by all,
since the local merchant pays a heavy
Ux to support the sUte, county and
city or village government where he
conducts his business and livesfl This
.tax is used in supporting the schools,
affording police and fire protection,
providing roads, bridges, and side
walks, and lighting the city. There
fore, it would be unjust to allow a
transient peddler, whx pays nothing
toward the support of these things,
who feels no obligation or Interest in
the community, to compote with tho
local merchant without paying the
Uxes hat the local merchant Is com
pelled to pay. The peddler Is, there
fore, compelled topny trie sluie and
local license.
But, how about the maii-oruiv
house? It is allowed to do business
in every locality in the United SUtes
wi'hout paying ANY license, fee or
Ux to the community. Th compcl.
tion of this in.ititution is manifestly
more unfair than the competition of
the peddler, and yet, we discrimina c
against the peddler, "the Individual
man" and in favor of the mail-order
house, "the large corporation ',
The peddler sUys over nigiit, .ptn-
a few dollars for board and lodging
in every community. Ine mail-order
house does not leavk one csnt in the
community whore it does thousands
of dollars wor'h of business.
The mail-order house sends out iU
huge caUlogucs whMi are more ef
fective as salesmen than the peddler
who goes about with his measly stock.
The big mail-order house sella every
thing, from a pencil to an automobile,
thus,' competing with every mercan-

tee consister of Scott Ktter, Henry
Tipton, C. M. Richards, S. P. Hostler.
Mr. Ktter, as chairman of the com
mittee, presented the cause of the

states this morning that the Ixinn
Hoard held that they were going to

now anticpate. Chairman Norria of
the I.and Hoard went further in the
announcement of their decision and
stated that if any legal complication
should arise that their Board will Im
mediately present to Congress in De
cember a small amendment to the act
legalizing loana upon auch landa. He
advised the committee to proceed
with their applications under the art
and present them direct to the Board
at Washington at an early data. The
Board also requested chairman Etter
to prepare a brief in detail upon the
Carlxbad Project and submit It to
their Board at Washington Immed

lands, the production of crops, the
amount of live stock upon sume, the
equipment with which the furniers
are now supplied and all other in

of the d'y land farm'-rH in Eddy coun
ty ui well ns that of the Irrigated

cause of these people. He urged the
necessity of the Farm Loan Board ap
plying benefit of this act to these
people, especially upon the plains and
surrounding territory in Eddy coun

if any effort to secure the location
of the hank and it seemed to be a
general opinion that Amurillo would
