I.O.N"DON. Nov. '-'1 Sir Hiram. Ill
vcntor of an automatic system of fire
arms, died at home here early today. j
Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim, Amerl- >
ran-born, was one of the most famous
inventors, civil, mechanical and electrical'engineers
of Oreat Britain. Ho
was most ftdely known as the Inveutor
of the Maxim machine gun. which
makes the recoil of the weapon servo
s the power for reloading, and which
is the weapon largely used In the European
war today.
Ho was horn In Snngervllle. Me.. I
Kebrunry 1N40. the son of Isaac I
i. Weston and Harriet M. Maxim, and!
received only a common school edu-'
ration, but lie acquired scicntilic I
knowledge by reading and attending j
lectures. He went to England in 18S1, |
ind had resided there even since. He
was knighted hy Queen Victoria in
1901.
? His Bon, Illram Percy Maxim, 1b a
well known inventor In the United
States, known particularly as the in. ester
of the Maxim silencer.
, Kor many years Sir Hiram was a J
director in the llrtn of Vlckers Sons J
and Maxim, but resigned that post |
Si in 1911. Kor more than thirty years
he experimented in aeronautics and
t invented flying machines. In the light
J Jf the present war. with its numerous
I German airship raids on Englund. It
Is remarkably interesting to recall|,
i that eight years ago Sir Hiram took ,
?, !he British nation to task for its small
interest in aeronautics, and pointed j
6 'hen. at a time when aeroplanes wore ;
S in their infancy, that England was in ,
grave danger of bombardment by air- .
ships.
"Does any one doubt for a moment." ,
said he. "that in ease we find our ,
solves at war with a continental pow- |
or. airships will he used for bombard- j
ing English towns, both ou the coast1,
and inland? The city of London with-1
in a year's time can he attacked with-.
out our enemy needing to fear the
boasted British fleet."
Following the success of the Wright
biplane. Sir Hiram renewed his long
continued interest in aviation and in j
1910 perfected a machine which he t
declared had certain advantages over i
the Wright's. It was he who. with
, others,' interested the British government
in beginning its organization of
an aerial navy and though he was
, then 70 years old he lived to see the j
\ great war bring air fighting to pass
r in even greater measure, probably. 1
\ . than he himself had dreamed. ,
In addition to his gun an aeroplane,
t he patented many electrical invea- ,
tlons, including incandesent lamps,
8 self-regulating current machines, scv- 1
\ eral pieces of ordnance, and a smokeless
powder.
The aged inventor took a keen interest
in the war. and from time to ;
> time there were unconfirmed reports
. of his Invention of devices to meet 1
r the needs or the war. one of them bc\
lng an apparatus to counteract the ,
; effects of the poisonous gases which
the Germans were first to bring into
use. In 1P15 he was appointed a member
Of tire Inventors' Board of the Brltiy
Ish Munitions department under Lloyd i
R George.
Sir Illrain applied himself so stron- ]
uously to science throughout his long '
life that even his recreations were giv- i
en by him as "reading scientific books
and studying the ahstraet sciences." i
- He wrote many Important articles anil i
an autobiography. "My Life." in 1915.
He was a chevalier of the Legion
of Honor, a member of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, the Hoval
' Society of Arts, the British Associa- 1
tlon for the Advancement of Science 1
... and numerous other scientific bodies. 1

Investigations I)o Not Produce
Improvement in
Conditions.
WASHINGTON. I). (\. Nov. J4.?
Convinced that tin- consumers of tlic
country uiust have relief, President
Wilson personally is to tackle the high
cost ot living pronlem. The President,
seeing no hope In Congressional and
departmental investigation* which in
the past have never been productive
of results, is considering drastic suggestions
for meeting the soaring prices
of the necessities ot life. Legislation
is contemplated which woul 1 permit
the government, In eases where artificial
stimulation of prices is uncovered,
to take over for a limited period
the business of distributing nil commodities
necessary to lite, such as food
and coal. The matter has been discussed
In detail with members of the
cabinet and the decision reached that
the situation 1b serious enough to command
the host thought of the administration,
this thought to he translated
into offcctlt e action as speedily as pos
libit.
President Wilson, it Is learned, has
reached the conclusion that the time
lias arrived for action which will result
in something more than the filing
of a voluminous report discussing conditions,
kuown by pretty nearly everybody,
at great length but suggesting
no effective remedy. Accordingly the
President is considering ways and
means of giving the government a
club to use whenever the situation demands
strenuous action.
Tile proposal now being given careful
stuuy 1s to place tbe power in the
hands of the Federal Trade Commts
sion, the commission to act upon tbc
complaint ot the Attorney General.
The Attorney General, under the proposed
law, through his ugents, would
keep watch ot the situation throughout
the country with respect to the
concenratlon of food supplies, combl
nations, pools, or manipulations of any
kind, including the manipulation of
transportation agencies.
Whenever, under tho proposed law,
any such action is discovered or suspected,
it will bo the duty of -he Attorney
General to notify the Federal
Trade Commission. The commission,
in turn, will at once call a hearing to
last but nine days. On the tenth day
the commission will render a decision.
Should it be demonstrated that there
had been any concentration, combination
or manipulation designed to in
flate prices, the commission, through
agents, would lake over the distribution
i f the commodities in question. A
price would be fixed giving the dealers
a profit ot not more than three per
cent, and this would be the cost of
the commodity In question until normal
conditions prevailed. It is proposed
to attach a heavy penalty for
violation of the orders issued by the
commission.
Salvation Army to

Oil hundred and lifly persons will
be invited lo the Thanksgiving dinner
