her as'a Russian composer, she wrote:
"The ballet opens with the first of

Miss Luranah Aldrldge's musical
compositions are published by thirteen
or fourteen music publishing houses in
London. Her vocal and Instrumental
productions seem to have struck a
popular chord, and tbe output of her
facile pen finds a ready sale and a pop
ular reception among the higher class
of artists and music lovers In England.
It the war is soon brought to an end
these two talented women, who have
done so much with voice and pen In
foreign lands to lift up the race of
which tbelr father was a notable,and
worthy example, may, If sufficient In
ducement Is offered, visit tbe United
States on tour and charm the music
loving public with exhibitions of tbelr
wonderful art.
In another private letter from Miss
Luranah she speaks of her sister, Ira,
who was visiting friends at BatbfEng
land, and while there was urged and
consented to sing at the celebrated
Pump Room concert In 1906. One of
her pupils, writing to ber sister, Lu
ranah, about the concert, said "My
dear Miss Aldridge, I am sure you and
your mother would like to know that
I have heard front several sources how
beautifully ytfur' sister sang at tbe
Pump" Room. My aunt writes to me
that all agree sbe has a. glorious voice!
I don't fancy they often hear such
singing In Bath, .fnd I can quite un
derstand how much It was appreci
ated."
The achievements of these brilliant
and talented women ought to be an In
spiration to every colored girl and wo
man in America who is musically In
clined. What the Aldridge sisters have
done and are doing they can do.. Go to
it, young women. The world Is yours.
