erty of Mr. J. A. Bouvier.

sell the city a 30 foot strip off a lot in
North Ocala near the A. C. L. water
tank for street purposes was referred
to the street Committee with instruc
tions to report back ' to council their
findings.- It seems that thelot has
for some years been left open and the
people in the neighborhood have come
to look upon it as a public passage
way and used it as such, so when it
was closed up some time ago the
fence was removed by "parties un
known to this affiant." - "

for the Ocala House property was
read, in which notice was served on
the city officials that the owner would

furnished to the tenants of the build

of the building be notified that a

cessary when service is desired on this

pairs necessary on the sewer disposal

was brought on that the city engi
neers had not filed a bond as agreed

that it would be economical for the
city to own and operate a rock crush
ing plant at the quarry from which
street paving material is secured, and
the matter was referred to the street
committee. A bid from the Ocala Iron
Works to furnish this plant, exclusive
of the electric motor, was read and
accepted. The price, to be paid for
this is $2235. An offer from the Fairbanks-Morse

AN INTERESTING CHARITY
For the past months an observing
man has seen some men and boys pick
ing up the pieces of tin-foil that may
be found on the streets, the. wrappings
of chewing-gum and cigarette pack
ages. He may have wondered what
a grown man is doing such a thing for.
Well, thereby hang3 a tale. Several
months ago' up in Washington City
the Atlantic Coast Line officials found
a poor crippled waif left at their
station." Nobody seemed to know
where he came from or who he was.
Being generous hearted people there
seemed nothing to do but to take care
of him. By some means, the present
writer does not know how, it was
suggested that his support could be
taken care of, if the agents along the
A. C. L. could interest people in sav
ing" the tin-foil which is so largely
thrown away, and in sending it to
Washington for the support of thi3
unfortunate boy. It has been taken
up all along the line, and a great deal
of it has been shipped to George P.
James, D. P. A at Washington, who
sells it and applies it to the care of
the railroad's ward. An interesting
item in the Tampa Tribune, of Friday,
said that a shipment of 588 pounds of
tin-foil was sent from that city for
this purpose, 300 pounds of which was
the donation of one man, a cigar mak
er. This was not the first large ship
ment from Tampa.
So this 13 the reason persons in the
city may be seen picking up the pieces
which chewers -' and smokers have
thrown away as useless. It is being
turned over to Mr. E. M. Finch of the
A. C. L., who will be glad to receive
all that may be given him and will
forward it to it3 proper destination.
Thus that which hitherto has been
thrown 'away may be put to a most

ORGANIZED DEMOCRATS
HOT ONTHE TRAIL OF THE
INSURGENTS
(Special to the Star) V
Jacksonville, Oct. 18. The demo
cratic campaign is now in full swing.
A big force is busily-engaged mailing
literature to the' voters, and speakers
have started with the itineraries pre
pared by the campaign committee and
the various county committees. "
Mr. Knott will speak the balance of
this week in North and "West Florida.
He will be accompanied through West
Florida by IL H. Wells, a member of
the campaign committee.
Will II. Price, democratic nominee
for. presidential elector, will begin
speaking Friday covering an itinerary
through . West Florida terminating at
Pensacola.
Amos Lewis and Ellis F. Davis ad
dressed a large meeting last night at
Marianm cn the occasion of the or
ganization of a Knott campaign club
in Jackson county. Eimilar clubs will
be organized during the week in other
counties of West Florida.
W. S. Jennings viiTI begin his speak
ing itinerary at Green Cove Springs
next Monday, and will proceed down
the East Coast.
E. W. Davis, begins an itinerary at
Bushnell next Monday morning that
takes in Webster, Brooksville, Crystal
River, Inverness, . Dunnellon, Mcin
tosh, Lee sburg, Ocala, Eustis and Ta-
vares. 1
Reports are persistently coming to
the democratic headquarters that
speakers for Sidney J. Catts, prohi
bition candidate for governor, are
making the positive statement that if
the supreme court had allowed the
state canvassing board to count the
vote Mr. Catts gained in Alachua,
that he would have been tie demo
cratic nominee. In crder to refute
this false impression, designedly
created to hurt the democratic candi
date, George P. Raney, state chair
man, directed the following telegram
to H. Clay Crawford:
"H. Clay Crawford, Tallahassee:
"Please wire at my -expense num
ber uncounted votes in gubernatorial
mater on file in your office Oct. 10 for
Sidney J. Catts, also for W. V. Knott,
also as of dat of October ICth. .
"George P. Raney, Chairman."
3Ir. Crawford promptly replied as
follows:
"George P. Raney, Jacksonville:
"Uncounted votes gubernatorial
race on file this office October 10,'
Catts C6, Knott 88. No new returns
filed since the tenth.
"IL Clay Crawford."
This statement from the secretary
of state shows beyo:d any possibility
of argument that Mr. Knott is the
rightful and legal nominee of the
Florida democracy. As no time since
Sept. 21st do the records show that
Mr. Catts was ever entitled to be con
sidered the democratic nominee.
The supporters of the prohibition
candidate are beginning to realize
the seriousness of the turning tide of
public sentiment and reports are com
ing to the headquarters that it is be
ing circulated in the rural districts
that Mr, Knott is a Catholic, in the
face of the fact that Mr. Knott ha3
been for many years a devout member
of the Baptist church, has contributed
libei ally of his means and time for
the up-building of this denomination
and for years has been a deacon of
his church, and the secretary of the
beard of trustees of Columbia College,
a Baptist educational institution in
this state. "
