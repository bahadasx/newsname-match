Stephen High Wins Game
Last Saturday the Warren high
school foot ball team went down in
her game against the strVifrg aggre
gation from Stephen. K'The home'
team was outclassed by' tjie/ Stephen
back field. Our line as a whole was
much better than that of 'the oppos
ing team but due to the superior
work of the Stephen team ,?n working
the forward passes they outdid our
boys. The Stephen back field was
much heavier than that of* the War
ren team, thus enabling %ythem to
break up the interference
fof our
team and stop the work in spite of
the efforts of the home team.
Stephen was not successful in line
plunges and nearly all of their gains
were made upon their forward pass
es. The work of the Warren line
was equal or superior to that of the
Stephen line. The work of Kenneth
in face of defeat their work was
clear cut and consistent through out.
The back field, in spite of the fact
that they were working against heavy
and experienced odds, did their work
well
The score was 45 to 0 in favor of
Stephen. We are hoping that the
next game will be more 'of,an even

Those Pesky Weeds.t
It has been clearly demefhstrated
to most of the farmers this season
that to get rid of the weeds it will
be necessary to prevent them from
going to seed, and that in order to
do this the infected lands will have
to be seeded down to tame grass.
War on the weeds will have to be
carried on by the individual land
owner, the town officials ^and the
grand jury. The man who fails to
prevent noxious weeds growing on
his land or along his side, of the
road from going to seed should be
shown no consideration what ever.
The iron hand of the law' must be
made to grip the offenders. A couple
of years would suffice to get rid of
the weeds if all work together and

tatoes are not of the best class

them scurvey, else they would have
brought more money If the different
farmers' clubs around here will act
conceitedly, in planting a uniform
variety of potatoes and raise enough
of them to warrant the installation
of a potato warehouse here, and the
sorting of the potatoes so that car
loads of uniform size and quality can
be shipped, the receipts will be great

Here's a Sure Road to Wealth
American Magazine: There is one
sure road to wealth. It is not a get
rich-quick scheme, no wildcat mining
venture, no "war baby'' speculation
it is simply a common-sense way of
attaining a small fortune in a strict
ly legitimate way.
One dollar deposited in a savings
bank each week for twenty years
would amount to $1,612.
Five dollars deposited each week
for the same length of time would
become $8,000. The interest on this
$8,000 would be $6 a week. Any
one following out this plan of week
ly deposits of $5 for twenty years
could at the end of that period draw
out of the bank $6 each week as long
as he lived and still leave to his wife
and family at his death not only all
he deposited but half as much
more.
The young man of 20 who will save
27J cents a day in a savings bank
paying 4 per cent compound interest,
and keep up these payments or de
posits till he is 70 years of age,
would have a fortune of $29,000,
which would pay interest of $22 each
week. This interest would be about
ten times the amount saved each
week.2**
