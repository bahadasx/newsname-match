ATHENS, Oct. 18.—Threat-
ened with attack by a huge
crowd of anti-ally demonstra
tors, the French marine force
that occupied the municipal
theater has abandoned the
building and encamped in the
Zeappaleon gardens, near the
Royal palace.
Greek troops are still patrolling
the streets and a Greek battalion
is guarding the Royal palace.
The situation is most tense.
Anti-ally leaders are working
among the crowds, denouncing
the allies for seizing the Greek
warships and attempting to stir
the mobs to new demonstrations
of hostility toward the allies' sail
ors.
Athens is virtually under mar
tial law.
Reports that King Constantlne
had fled are denied by Greek of
ficials.
The trouble began Monday aft
ernoon. Great crowds had gath
ered to watch Greek sailors from
the ships taken over by the al
lied powers, in review before King
Constant inc.
As the parade ended and the
king took his departure amid
cheers, several shouts of "Down
witli Vennizelos" and "Down with
the allies" were heard.
Shortly afterward French ma
rinnes, landed at Piraeus an re
ports that riots wer threatening,
reached the capital and took pos
session of the municipal theater.
A great crowd, formed partly of
Greek reservists, swarmed about
the marines and shouted insult
ing remarks.
The French got their machine
guns ready for action, but to
avoid trouble, withdrew Inside
the theater.

GALVESTON, Tex., Oct. 18.—
The circus train was stalled by an
empty water-tank of the engine.
The engineer and fireman were
vociferously mingling mutual' ac
cusations with profanity.
Then they saw a long, snaky
object wriggle over the rear of
the tender and dart down into
tho empty tank.
The object proved to be an ele
phant's trunk.
Following this very tangible
clue, they discovered that three
elephants who were occupying
the rear of the tender had lifted
off the cover of the tank and
utilized the entire contents In
shower-bath.-.
As a punishment for this in
fraction of railroad etiquette the
elephants were compelled by a
Hindu hahout named O'Reilly to
push the locomotive three miles
to the nearest source of water
supply.
