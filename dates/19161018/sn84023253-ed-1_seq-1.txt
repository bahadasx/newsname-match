BOY KILLED BY AUTOMOBILE.
Dr. Allen Who Owned and Drove
Macliine Is Held Blameless By
Witness.
Simeon Vermette, 15 years old,
son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Vermette
of Maple street, was Instantly killed
by being struck by an automobile
owned and driven by Dr. J. M. Allen,
Friday forenoon at about 11.30, near
the Maplewood farm on the road 'o
Lyndonville.
The boy In company with Leroy
Brooks, both of whom were employ
ed by George H. Morrill as farm
hand, had just left the house on the
way to the pasture. As they started
north in the main road, Brooks heard
an automobile and also the warning
horn, and turning saw Dr. J. M. Al
len in his new roadster about 100 feev
away. Brooks was walking on the
outside with the boy toward the, mid
dle of the road. According to the
former's story he warned the youth,
saying, "Look out Sim, there's an auto
coming." So saying he stepped to one
side and expected young Vermette to
do the same. For some unexplain-
able reason, just as the car got to
ther... the boy looked over his should
er and then jumped sideways toward
the middle of the road and directly
In front of Dr. Allen's car. One of
the lamps struck him, knocking him
down and he was dragged a short dis
tance beneath the car.
Dr. Allen applied the emergency
brakes and stopped within a few feet.
He glanced at the boy and then tele
phoned for Dr. C. A- Cramton. The
authorities were also notified and
Health Officer F. S. Harriman and
Officer Thomas "Wallace responded.
Dr. Cramton found life extinct ana
the body was removed to Calder
wood's undertaking rooms.
Dr. Allen's statement that he was
running his car at a moderate rate or
speed is verified by Mr. Brooks, the
only witness of the accident and is
further borne out by the fact that
loose gravel has recently been placea
in the road there which rendered
fast driving practically Impossible
Other evidence, if any is needed, to
prove that the doctor had his car un
der perfect control, was the straight
path made by the wheels up to the
scene of the accident. According to
both Mr. Brooks and Dr. Allen neither
of the persons on the road were ir
any danger had they remained where
they were, as the road is very wide
and the car would have cleared them
bv several feet. Neither one of them
could explain the action of the boy I
in jumping as he did toward the car
unless it was that he did it in a spirit
of fun or became confused when he
looked over his shoulder and saw 'the
car so close upon them.
Simeon Vermette was the only son
of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Vermette and
would have been 15 years old next
December 9. He had been employed
as chore boy by Mr. Morrill since the
closing of St. Gabriel's school last
June. Besides his parents he is sur
vived Dy two sisters. Rose, aged 13,
and Lora aged 10.
Fred Vermette, father of the boy,
had just returned from Whltefield, N.
H., where he was called last Saturday
to attend the funeral of his mother,
who died in the hospital there after
the amputation of a leg.

MILK STATION FOR
Boston Concern Will Open Business
ing- -Newport Producers Hold
A new creamery and milk receiving station will be opened in St.
Johnsbury, probably within ten days, in the Griswold-McKinnon
building on Railroad street. The concern interested is the Plymouth
Creamery Co. of Boston, John P. Davies, proprietor.
It is planned to make St. Johnsbury a shipping center for cream
and milk in this locality, which will be bought anyway convenient to
the producer.
It is understood the company will pay highest prices at this re
ceiving station and special inducements offered to the farmers of this
locality and surrounding towns to bring milk and cream here.
The Plymouth company operates extensively in Vermont, owning
creameries at different points in the state, one of which is at Newbury.
Some creameries in the locality also furnish an amount of milk and
cream which is shipped by the Plymouth company.
It is not expected that butter making will be included in the
scope of the new concern but that a large shipping plant will event
ually be established. The necessary repairs to the building for the
accommodation of the new business has been pushed rapidly and the
necessary machinery is now being installed.
Newport Will Stop Shipping Milk To Boston
Nwport, Oct. 16. At a meeting of local milk producers held
Saturday night at School hall, in co-operation with the New England
Milk Producers association it was voted to discontinue the shipping
of milk for Massachusetts markets after October 17. This action is to
hold until a six months contract offered by the purchasers is made
effective on the basis of 50 cents per 8V2 quart can of the Massachu
setts standard of .335 butter fat, delivered in Boston and a premium
of 3 cents for each tenth of one per cent butter fat in addition.
W. T. Kilborn of Derby is president of the association and F. J.
Libbey is secretary.
Newport is probably the largest milk center in northeastern Ver
mont and the action of the producers in that vicinity, if widespread,
would be significant in the face of recent statements by the Hood Co.
that their milk was all contracted for at a price below 50 cents.
About 45,000 pounds are shipped daily from Newport for Massachu
setts by the Hood Co.
F. L. Alexander, the local manager of the Hood Co., told The
Caledonian tonight that only a few of the smaller producers are mem
bers of the association and that two-thirds of the officers did not have
more than 10 head of cows and many others less than that. He con
tinued: "The large producers of the Hood Co. are sticking by the
company. The members of the association represent only from 10 to
15 per cent of the milk usually brought in to us and the total member
ship will not exceed 25. We anticipate no serious competition."
The Newport Milk Co. is said to be affected somewhat more than
the Hood-Co., it L'ing reported that they have lost some of their best
producers through the new organization. .

lAUTO KILLS
BARTON LAD
Lewis Stratton, 8 Years Ot Age,
Dies Almost Instantly After Be
ing Struck By Jenness' Machine
DRIVER IS NOT BLAMED
Hoy Was Driving Cows at Intersection
of Glover and Elm Streets When
Accident Occurred Was Son
of Mr. and Mra. Leon Stratton
of Lake Street.
Barton, Oct. 17 Louis Stratton,
aged eight years, was Instantly killed
when struck by the automobile owned
and driven by C. P. Jenness of this
place. The accident occurred at th
Intersection of Glover and Elm
streets about 3:30 this afternoon when
the boy stepped from behind some
cows he was driving, into the path of
the machine. The driver is held
blameless.
Glover and Elm streets Intersect at
right angles and according to specta
tors Louis Stratton was driving a herd
of cows across the intersection as the
car driven by Mr. Jenness approach
ed at right angles from the other
street. The boy was partly hidden by
a cow at the rear of the herd, and he
stepped out just as the auto reached
the spot. The boy's face was crushed,
although the machine did not go over
him, and the supposition is, that one
of the lights struck him in the face.
He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Leon
Stratton who reside on Lake street.
CALEDONIA COUNTY LEADS.
Has More Cows Under Test Than Any
Other County In United States.
James D. McNulty of the United
States Dairy Division has spent part
of two weeks here with County Agent
L. A. Wood, purchasing cows for a
demonstration herd at the National
Dairy show. The purpose of this
demonstration herd is to show that
records are absolutely essential in or
der for a farmer to know what his
herd Is doing. Only cows with Cow
Testing association records for one or
more years were purchased.
It is a significant fact that Mr. Mc
Nulty came to Caledonia County for
his cows because Caledonia county has
more associations and more cows on
test than any other county in th
United States. At the present time
more than 2,000 cows are being tested
In 141 herds.
Nearly every farmer believes In the
Cow Testing association, but many
farmers hesitate to put their herds In
an association because they fear that
they will find several cows that are
"boarders," and that their herds are
not good enough to put Into an as
sociation. Some .think that their
dairies must make a good showing,
but the poor dairies are the dairies
that need the association and its help.
If the association keeps closed books,
one will hot know what another's
dairy is doing. Some feel that thy
can do their own testing. Many
farmers can test but in Caledonia
county, to the county agent's knowl
edge, there are but three farmers that
are doing it and keeping complete
records.
There are a dozen good reason's
why every dairyman should be In in
association and know Just what each
cow is doing and whether she is on
the profit or loss side at the end of the
year. A pretty good vindication or
the value of the associations is that
our most' successful farmers are
members.
County Agent L. A. Wood is at the
National Dairy show and will not te
in his office Saturday, Oct. 21.
The L. S. C. of the Universalist
church will hold a rummage sale at
the old Mission rooms, Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday, Oct. 26, 2 7, 28.
