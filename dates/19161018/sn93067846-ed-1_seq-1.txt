The Stu e.
The Scimitar, a semi-monthly
political paper edited by a Blease
partisan, W. P. Beard, and published
at Abbeville, displays conspicuously
a ballot headed "For Governor: Cole
I* Blease," and calls upon "the Re?
form Democrats" to vote that ticket.
The Scimitar says that Mr. Blease
himself, bound by tho pledge he took
on beccming a candidate, is obliged
to abide by the decision of tho ex?
ecutive committee, which nominated
R. I. Manning, and therefore he will
not likely make a statement. "But
the voters are not bound by anything
but the on h to support the nomi?
ne?," The Scimitar says, "and a ma?
jority has .he right to say who Is
tfie nominee."
Folio vlng Is the ballot published
by Tho Scimitar, with the caption,
"Our Ticket " "For govornor, Cole

thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, blind

riff-raff of society and thanked God

And what is all this for? And why
do they claim that Mr. Bleaso must
announce himself a candidate before
ho can be voted for in the general
olectlon ? Tnat is not true, we can
vote for any man we choose,
whether he is a candidate or not.
Mr. Bleise as far as we know will
muke no statement at all. There Is
none th&t he should make.
"He entered the primary at tho ur?
gent solicitation of the leading He
form Democrats all over the State.
His pledge as a candidate binds him
to abide by the decision of the execu?
tive committee. All ho could do wus
to offer his evidence of fraud and
abide by the result. He did that and
' the committee treated with contempt
?refused to act. If the people also
lay down and submit to such treat?
ment that is usually accorded to ne?
groes, then thero is nothing for Blease
to do but submit also.
"Tho question is altogether a moral
one, and one of Individual conscience.
Blease Is bound by his pledge to sub?
mit to the findings of the committee,
' and can not?for that reason- offer as
? a candHate before the general elec?
tion. But the voters are not bound by
anything but the oath to support the
nominee, and a majority has the right
to say vho is the nominee.
"Therefore if you honestly believe,
us most of us do, that Please was

hound by anything, becauHc a broach
of the contract by one party releases

Building One or More Battlcsliips ot

Washington, Oct. 13.?Navy officials
anticipate that American battleships,
authorized next year will be armed
with twelve 16-inch rifles as againgt
the eight lG-inch guns of the ?hip?
for which bids will be opened October
25. Members of the general board are
said to be in favor of radically in?
creasing the size of the new battle?
ships in order that the 50 per cent ln-l
crease in gun power may be attained.
To carry twelve lU-inch rifles it has
been roughly estimated that the ships
I would require a displacement of prob?
ably 38,000 tons, as against the 32,000,
tonnage of the lour ships to be laid
down next year. The first of thC
larger ships will not be laid down, in
all probability, before 1918.
The general board ft.vored four ,16,
000-ton vessels carrying ton 16-lnch
guns ouch for tho coming year. The
decision of the department to make
them 32,000-ton ships with eight guns

CARRANZA'S DOWNFALL PRE
DICTEl).
Reports Say He Ha.s Alienated All of
Ills Loyal Supporters.
Washington, Oct. 13.? Disquieting
reports from Mexico reached here to?
day from many sources. They Indi?
cate that Curratua has alienated
practically all of his former loyal sup?
porters and his downfall before Jan?
uary is predicted. Should this occur
another wild-scramble between at

of the department of justice are
watching large quantities of arms

Is follows: "I read your ticket in

500 if not near 1,000 In Dillon county.
We will scratch Manning anyway and
want every true Bleaselte to scratch

TO DEAL TO CHINESE DIRECT
CHARLESTON TO BE VI SITEB OCT.
17 BY FORMER MAYOR ROSE,
i OF MILWAUKEE.
China's Government Backs Steamship
. Line Which Will Call at Charleston
?Talks on Oriental Trade.
Washington, Oct. 13.?"There are
as many business opportunities in
China today as there were in this
country 100 years ago," declared for?
mer Mayor David S. Rose, of Milwau?
kee, who as general counsel of the
Chinese-American Product Exchange
Company, will visit Charleston next
Tuesday, October 17, in company with
Dr. Clarence J. Owens, president of
the organization. Charleston is to be
?ne of the ports of call for the steam?
ship line projected by the company.
Mr. Rose, who was for five terms
tnaygr of Milwaukee, has recently re
1 turr#:d to the United States, after a
'six months' stay in China, where he
became so impressed with the desire
of that vast and rapidly awakening na?
tion to deal directly with the Unite
States that he decided to devote his
time entirely to an effort to develop
this neglected field. His brother,
Robert F. Hose, who Is secretary of
the Chinese-American Product Com?
pany, was formerly trade adviser of
the department of State and resigned
In order to throw his energies and
Interests into thla work. ,
It is the confident belief of Mayor
Rose and his associates in this effort
jto build'up a direct trade with China
j that success is sure if we go at the
I thing in the way the Chinaman un
i.derstands and requires. We must ap?
proach him ourselves and not through
European or Japenese agents. We
must have the ships to carry the goods
we desire to sell and to bring back
goods which the United States will buy
from China. We must eliminate the
' business of exchange through Lon
&on or Liverpool and have our own
inraneh banks In China to handle, the
erisbfish.
The Chinese-American Product Ex?
change Company is now undertaking
to organize a steamship company to
build power schooners of 4.F00 tons
capactiy to operate between China
and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of
the United States (through the Pana?
ma canal.) It is also proceeding to
organizing a string of Chinese-Ameri?
can banks at the treaty ports of the
Celestial Em?beg pardon, Republic?
I with,' the parent bank in Atlanta, Ga.
So much is the Chinese government
interested that it is guaranteeing that
the profits of the steamship company
shall be sufficient to pay the interest
and sinking fund on its bonds, prom?
ising to make up any deficit that ma>
accrue.
Mayor Rose talked most eloquently
and enthusiastically on China while
seated in his office at the head of the
suie which has for some months
been occupied by his company in one
of the large otFlee buildings of Wash?
ington. His praise of the business
character of the Chinaman was un?
stinted.
"The reason the people of China are
so anxious to have direct commercial
and industrial dealings with the Uni?
ted States," Mr. Rose said, "is that
we are the only great nation China
does not suspect of having designs or
her territory or her independence. The
Chinaman knows from experience
that the United States is not trying to
take advantage of him politically or
otherwise.
"The return of our portion of the
Boxer indemnity exacted of China
some years ago by the combination of
world Powers which participated ii
the expedition to Peking produced a
lasting impression to our credit on
tho Chinese consciousness.
J "Eevery million of the sum return
j ed by Uncle Sam will soon come back
to him n hundred-fold in business
which he will owe to Chinese confi?
dence* and good will. They have u
great University In China which the\
have built out of this remitted money,
and It will stand forever as a inoun
ment, more enduring than brass, to
'the generosity of the only great Pow?
er thai has been really sympathetic
with China and friendly to her people
In a national way."
As to the industrial backwardness
of the Chinese, Mr. Kose cited the
fact that the farm laborer gets an
average wage of $1 a month.
, "There is not a tannery or a shoe
factory In the whole Republic," he
sa d. "though the Hhoes I have on
and they are the most comfortable 1
ever wore, and i have been wearing
them practically ever since 1 got them
In China- were made from American
leather by a Chinese shoemaker, nt
a cost to me of $3.60 for the complet?
ed product.''

Tho shoes looked all right, and the
interviewer would never have suspect?
ed that they had not come from an
American factory or shop.
"And there is nothing to be said
against the looks or the quality of
this suit I have on," continued Mr.
Rose?and he was quite right, in the
opinion of his newspaper guest.
"What do you thing the Chinese tail
jr charged me? Just $20! The suit
Aiuld have cost twice as much .over
here "
A new Chinese railroad has been
financed by American capital, and its
construction is about to begin at an
estimated ultimate cost of 100,000,?
000. The National City Bank ,of New
York, is understood to be among the
?ackers of this enterprise.
One of the statements made by for?
mer Mayor Rose to illustrate the
normous possibilities of Chinese de?
velopment was this:
"There are not 25 miles of highway
it for an automobile to travel on in
.he whole of China."
