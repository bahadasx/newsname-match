That
Is What This Milwaukee Man Man Who Cracked Crossville Postoffice
Thinks of the Chronicle. Safe, Caught in Virginia.
The following letter from Chas.
Braun, a prominent real estate dealer
Laat week an officer of the govern
ment waa ia the county with a picture
of Milwaukee, Wis., ia aelf explanatory ' uf a man recently arrested in Virginia
and should act as an encouragement for
our merchants and other persona who
wish to reach buyers. The letter fol
lows: Milwaukee, Wis., Oct. 11, 1916.
Dear Mr. Bishop :
I received today, from a Mr.
Wilkes, of Loretto Tenn,., a draft tor
$310 for the land advertised in the
Chronicle. Mr. Wilkes nad seen it in
the Cfironicle. While the deal was go
ing on with Mr. Wilkes, 1 received nu
merous inquiries, one as far away as
Dakoto, ail said they had seen it in the
Chroincle. This certainly speaks well
for the Chronicle as an advertisng me
dium. This closes out my holdings in
your county. 1 intend to always stay
in touch with the plateau and its peo
ple through the chronicle. The people
of the plateau I have found to be hon
est, upright, hospitable, law abiding
citizens. But right here I want to give
your business men a little advice. It
has been my experience with your
business men, that they will not answer
letters written to them by non-residents.
This to a non resident is exas
perating, for it leaves bim practically
up in the air ; he does not know where
he is. it is also .injurious to your coun
ty. It was not so in the. day of C. C.
Way, U. C. Stevens and U. G. Dunbar.
These men all had more pep than your
business men of today. I would advise
all non-residents that get the same
treatment that I got, to ao their busi
ness through the Chronicle, where they
will not only get prompt attention, but
prompt results as well.
In conclusion let me wish you and the
Chronicle the bountiful success that
you both so well deserve. With kind
est regards.
Very truly yours,
Chas. Bruun.
as being the person who robbed the
postoffice here over a year ago.
The officer showed the picture to
"Duck" Smith' and asked him if he
knew the man. Mr. Smith replied that
he did and that it was the likeness of
the man who robbed the Crossville
postoffice. The Federal officer stated
that he wished- to get some papers
from Cookeville and secure a pass forj
Smith and have him go to Virginia and
identify the man.
It will be remembered that "Duck"
Smith arrested the postoffice robber in '
the woods near Lreston the morning
after the postoffice was robbed. After!
landing the man in jail Smith returned l
and made a search tor stamps the rob
ber had taken, along with a small
amount of money. Smith found over
$1,200 in stamps but no money. The
robber was taken to Cookeville for
trial when the federal court convened
following the robbery and escaped
from jail there. Until now nothing
had been known ot 'he whereabouts of
the robber. He was arrested while
acting as bookkeeper for some firm in
Virginia.
HOOPER SPEAKS
TO LARGE
COUNTY COURT.

Unable to Get Within Hearing Dis

Paying Bills and Report of

A Short Dock.t and Few Felony Cases.
FLOTERIAL CONVENTION.
Democrats Name Hon, A. D, Hargis. of
Grundy County, as Standard
Bearer.
The democratic flotenal convention
met at Pikeville Saturday and named
Hon. a. D. Hargis, of Grundy county,
as their candidate. Mr. Hargis is a
Confedeiate soldier and comes highly
lecommended by his people as a man
of high 2haracter, honesty, sobriety
and morality.
Following is the committee tor the
next two years, by counties :
Grundy W. C. Abernathy, Chair
man; C. W. Hembry,
Bledsoe N. J. Ferguson,
Cumberland G. W. Davenport,
Sequatchie R. E. Standifer,
Van Buren- M. C. Sparkman.
The selection of a democratic candi
date from Grundy county places both
notorial candidates in ihat county,
which would indicate that the fight
will surely be a warm one in tbat
county at least.
The work of the circuit court at the
last session was light and much to the
satisfaction of good peoole over the
county, the number of criminal cases
was small. They were as follows:
Irvin Norris, carrying pistol, sub
mitted and fined $50 and costs.
Clay Stone, public drunkenness,
nolled on costs and taxes.
Raymond Shernll, furnishing liquor
to a minor, nolled on costs and taxes.
James Hall, gaming, nolled on costs
Monday at one o'clock Gov. Ben W.
Hooper delivered one of his character
istic addresses in behalf of his candi
dacy for the United States senate as
the republican nominee against Con
gressman Kenneth D. McKellar. The
' speaker was introduced by Hon. A. L.
I Garrison, candidate for the state sen
I ate from this ninth district.
I Before introducing Gov. Hooper Mr.
Garrison stated a few things that he
i would favor in the event he is elected,
i among them being: That he would
endeavor to secure an appropriation of
$5,000 for the Cumberland Plateau
Fair Association, a good stock law that
would be approved by the farmers, a
change in the manner of appropriation
of the state school funds and the ex
tension of the open season in hunting
and the abolishing of the hunter's li
cense, unless the money should go to
the schools of this county. Also a good
and effective law for maintaining our
roads after being built.
Mr. Garrison spoke in most glowing
terms of the honescy, courage and
ability ot Governor Hooper according
no man in tre United States his super
ior along those lines.
The address of Governor Hooper was
strongly punctuated with ringing ap
plause by the large audience of nearly
800 people that filled the court room
until standing room was at a premium,
while many were unable to get within
hearing distance at all. Not for many
years has such a dense and enthusiastic
crowd been seen in that room or in
Crossville as greeted Gov. Hooper
Monday.
He handled his opponent in a way
The work of the quarterly term of
county court was the lightest at this
October term of any for many terms.
The county judge made his report,
which was accepted and other reports
were made.
The report of the county judge
showed much the same conditions as
usual. It showed the liabilities of the
county to be about $275,000 with assets
amounting to a little over $1,500. The
outstanding bonds ot the county are:
Pike Roads, $240,000; Court House
$19,000; Railroad $16,000, making a to
tal of $274,000.
Health Officer W. A. Keed made his
report, which was accepted. As H. K.
Webb is away no report was received
from the commissioner lor the poor
tor the past quarter.
A report was made by C. G. Black,
secretary of the Highway Commission,
showing disDursements and the amount
still on hand. The report showed that
$168,553.29 ot the $200,000 road funds
is still on hand. No statement was
made as to the number of miles ot
completed road as most ot the road
work is still in an uncompleted condi
tion. The progress made, however,
is very satisfactory to the public gen
erally, so tar as we have been able to
learn, and the feeling is general that
we are to have many miles of good
grade from the expenditure when com
pleted. Several persons were relieved from
road work on account of physical dis
ability. The road commissioners of the four
districts were directed to also look af
ter the bridge work of their districts
and send warrants against the county,
when the amount did not exceed $25,
when in excess of $25 it was to he pre
sented to the court for authorization.
FAIR SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Increase Small the Past Week Because
All Have Been Busy.
Owing to circuit court being in ses
sion here the past two weeks, some
political speakings also being on hand,'
not much has been aone in the way f
increasing the subscriptions to the
Cumberland Plateau Fair Association.
Elsewhere in this issue appears the
call of the chairman ot the association,
Dr. W. B. Young, of Clifty, asking the
people to meet in the court house to
morrow (Thursday) evening for a fur
ther discussion of the fair question.
A few more subscriptions have been
received since our iast issue, which
brings the total to $1,965. At the
meeting tomorrow night there will
very likely develop such interest as
will soon result in the subscriptions
going far beyond the present point.
No person should look upon this en
terprise as one that is asking people to
GIVE. It is only asking you to invest
a small amount in what is practically
sure of becoming an investment that
is sure to at least pay lawful interest
on the money invested.
Following are the names and amounts
of those wh., have subscribed up to
date:

the Frey and Stewart case gave Stew

days in jail and found damages for
Frey in the sum of $4'JU. A new trial
was asked and denied whereupon the
case was appealed
CIVIL CASES.
J. D. Burkhart, administrator, vs.
Cumberland Lumber Company. This
was a case in which Mr. Burkhart
brought suit for damages because his
son was killed while peeling tan baVk
for the Lumber Company. The suit
went against Mr. Burkhart and no
damages were allowed.
Wm. Beyers vs. Chas. Brewington.
This was a case wherein Chas. Brew
ington was charged with stealing hogs
claimed by Beyers. The case was
tried before justice of the peace and
Brewington came clear. Beyers then
brought suit in the circuit court to i
recover the hogs and was successful.
"McKellar claims to have aided in
enacting the Rural Credits bill, but he
did not vote on it and was not there
when it passed. " 'The Governor proved
his statement by showing the copy of
the. Congressional Rec.rd giving the
vote and the name oi Mr. McKellar
was not in the list ol those present.
"McKellar has falsified his own record
ill congress," said Governor Hooper,
WINTER COVER CROPS.
Good Farming in Our Beloved Southland
Cannot Be Done Otherwise.
A truth that Southern farmers,
sooner or later, must come to realize is
that saving our soils for our children
is one ot the greatest i all tasks con
fronting us, and that the intelligence
and energy with which we tackle the
job must in very large measure deter
mine our individual success or failure,
of the whole agricultural South.
Undoubtedly the most serious drain
on our stock of soil fertility has come.
j not through the cr.ips grown, but rather
I because we have allowed our plant
; foods to leach ami waeh away,
j Any good farmer knows that the
j leve land, however overcropped it may
j be, can be put back in good shape by
la tow crops of legumes plowed under
j or by an application of stable manure;

voters to get by with it and I say that
any man who will do that is not fit to
go to the senate, whether he be demo
crat or republican. "
The speech by Gov. Hooper aroused
the republicans of the county as they
nave not been aroused for years and
every indication points to a record vote
of the republican party in this county
in the coming election.
Gov. Hooper arrived from Monterey
shortly before noon by auto. He re
turned the same way to Monterey,
where he spoke Monday night and
from there he went to Jamestown yesterday.
THE IMPLEMENT SHED
From now till next spring most of
! the implements of cultivation will not
be used, nor will the planters. The
place for them, and for all o;ber lm-
i task of remaking
j trying one.
The wise farmer, then, is he who
1 saves his fields, and on our rolling lands
i the surest and best of all ways of doing
j this is by means of cover crops kept on
the land winter and summer.
We have particularly emphiszed the
value of crimson clover as a winter
cover crop because (1) it is a legume
or nitrogen-gatherer, maturing in
ample time to plow under for the corn
crop to follow ; (2) the seed required
to sow an acre coats much less than
similar quantities of bur clover and
vetch ; and (3) the crop is well suited
to practically all well drained soils In
the Cotton Belt. However, if for any
reason crimson clover cannot be used,
by all means cover the cultivated fields
with a crop of rye.
Abruzzi rye particularly is proving
