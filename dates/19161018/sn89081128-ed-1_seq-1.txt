NEW ULM TO HAYE
WHOLESALE STORE
SAUK CENTRE COMPANY WILL
OPEN BIG GROCERY HOUSE
HERE
TEMPORARY OFFICES SECURED
AND STOCK OF GOODS ON
WAY.
Hew Ulm is to have a wholesale gro
cery house. It will be in operation be
^#een now and December 1. Temporary
quarters have been secured and building
operations on a large warehouse and
offices will be begun this fall to be com
pleted early next spring. This is despite
the fact that the Brown County Journal
announced two weeks ago that the
project had fallen through, the pro
motors having gotten "cold feet" and
given up the idea.
Company Will Incorporate
The Nichols-Hicks-McNairy Com
pany of Sauk Centre has made arrange
ments to locate here with a large branch,
although a new corporation will be
formed to be known as the New Ulm
Grocery Company. Final incorporation
of the new concern will be completed
within a short time.
R. M. Hicks of Sauk Centre, vice presi
dent of the Nichols-Hicks-McNairy Com
\pany, who is to be manager of the new
^sompany, was in the city Saturday, to
complete arrangements for the beginnng
of business at once. For the present the
offices will be at 13 South Minnesota
street, and temporary storage room has
been secured in that building and in the
basement of the building occupied by the
South Side Garage. The first shipment
of goods is already on the way and will
be here within a few days.
While here Mr. Hicks looked over
several sites on the Chicago & North
western and Minneapolis & St. Louis
tracks for the new building, but definite
"*"s-astion has not yet been taken in that
respect. He was accompanied by Mrs.
Hicks, and they searched for a suitable
house as the Hicks family will move to
New Ulm as soon as possible. The
Albert Pfaender house on South Broad
way, was rented to be occupied by the
company's shipping clerk, who wiU move
here from Sauk Centre.
Decision Kept Quiet.
The Sauk Centre company has been
considering locating at New Ulm since
^Jfist winter and decided to make the move
several weeks ago, but this fact has been
known to only a few, including the
eview, until this time.
F. H. Behnke, who probably deserves
,e credit more than any one else for the
curing ol this enterprise for New Ulm,
never since the subject was first
scussed, given up the idea but that the
Ian would prove a reality. Discussing
ne coming of the firm to New Ulm Mr.
3ehnke said:
"I know of no better location for a
wholesale grocery house in Southern
Minnesota than this city. It is because
of my faith in New Ulm and its future
that I have been anxious for its coming
/here. The company has plenty of
backing and it will prove a great benefit
to the city. The company is locating
here for the business that is in sight, and
has never asked a bonus at any time.
It is such a relief for a concern seeking a
new location not to ask aid from the
^seitizens that I have been especially
anxious to see these people locate in New
Ulm.
In Local Territory.
"Their territory will be all over
Southern and Southwestern Minnesota,
covered by the M. & St. L. and the
Northwestern roads. In my opinion
this is the greatest acquisition the city
has had in a long time."
This is the first wholesale firm to locate
this city, but it is quite possible others
will soon follow suit.
CONGREGATIONALISTS AND
/*"*"-.
BAPTISTS TO CO-OPERATE
Rev. E. F. Wheeler returned Monday
from the annual conference and fiftieth
anniversary celebration of the establish
ment of Carleton College, aÂ£ Northfield,
Minn. Several matters of importance
were taken up dunng the session, which
occupied a greater part of last week,
one of the most important of which was
an agreement whereby there will be
actual co-operation in the future be
/*NKeen Carleton College and Pillsbury
V^ademy, a Baptist institution, located
at Owatonna.
By the new arrangements the Carle
ton authorities are to recognize the
Pillsbury institution as a preparatory
school for Carleton, and the officers of
the Owatonna institution are to urge
their graduates to enter Carleton to
complete their education.
Most of the larger colleges of the coun
try were represented at the Northfield
conference, the majority of theem by
their presidents.
Among the New Ulm people present
besides the Rev. Mr. Wheeler, were the
following: Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Beecher,
Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Krook, Mrs. C. A.
Zelle, Mrs. James Dougher, Mrs. W.
B. Mather, Mrs. H. C. Hess, Dr. Charles
Hess, and Mrs. Otto Seiter.
With the exception of Rev. Wheeler,
the New Ulm people returned home
Saturday. The latter stopped over to
hold services in the Congregational
church at Mapleton, having exchanged
pulpits with Rev. Edmund Larke, pastor
of the church at the place, who filled the
pulpit here Sunday.
MUNICIPAL PUNT
HEAT TURNED ON
STEAM IS FORCED THROUGH
PIPES FOR FIRST TIME
SUNDAY.
SOME OF BUILDINGS NEARLY
READY TO BEGIN USING
SERVICE
Steam has been turned on in the pipes
of the Municipal Heating Plant, and
as fast the buildings on Minnesota
street that are to be heated from the
central station can be connected up
they will receive their heat from that
source.
Steam Turned On
W. A. Rupea, superintendent for the
Healy Plumbing & Heating Company
of St. Paul, which has the contract for
installing the plant, said yesterday that
the Dakota House and the Somsen
building, corner of Minnesota and First
North streets will probably be the first
buildings to receive heat from the new
plant, as they will have their connections
completed within a day or two also
that most of the buildings on the west
side of Minnesota street, between First
and Second North streets, were nearly
ready to be served.
"It will be well toward Christmas be
fore all of the buildings will have their
pipes connected so they can take ad
vantage of the new system of heating,"
said Mr. Rupea.
Labor Scarce
It had been expected that the Healy
contract would have been completed
by October 1, but thf work was
held up somewhat by the non-arrival of
supplies and the scarcity of labor during
the summer and fall months, but as it
was, Mr. Rupea says, they were only
two weeks later than expected, which
he considers very good under the cir
cumstances.
Several of the owners are tardy in
letting contracts for their heating con
nections and some of them may be o
bhged to use their own plants, as in the
past, for at least the first part of the
winter, especially should this vicinity
be visited by an early cold snap.
FIREMENS' BANQUET OCT. 28.
Invitation cards have been issued by
the New Ulm Fire Department for its
annual banquet, which will be held at
Turner Hall, Saturday evening, October
28. The committee is making exten
sive preparations for the event, which it
is endeavoring to make surpass all
previous efforts.
THANKSGIVING NOVEMBER 30.
President Wilson yesterday designated
November 30 as the date to be observed
as Thanksgiving Day. A movement had
just been put under way to request the
President to name the 23rd as the holiday,
so that Thanksgiving and Christmas
would not come so near together, but
the plan was too late.
GRAIN SHOW AT FAIRMONT.
A grain show is to be staged at Fair
mont next February, under the auspices
of the Minnesota Crop Improvement
Association. The Fairmont Commerical
Club and Martin County Crop Improve
ment Association will co-operate with the
Minnesota association in securing at
tractive exhibits and a large attendance.
Persons desiring fuller information should
address Secretary of Minnesota Crop Im
provement Association, University Farm
St. Paul.
WATER SUPPLY OF
NEW ULH IS PURE
STATE HEALTH BOARD BRINGS
OLD CONTROVERSY TO END
AT LAST.
SAYS IN REPORT OFFICIALS
HAVE NOW COMPLIED WITH
REQUIREMENTS.
New Ulm's water supply has been
given an 0. K. by the State Board of
Health, according to reports received
here by city officials. The water in the
three wells from which the water used
by our citizens is pumped, is pure, the
state board says. A controversy of
long standing has now been settled and
the people of this city can breathe
easier.
The trouble started a couple of years
ago, when there was a typhoid fever
epidemic here, since which time there
have been numerous recommendations
to the authorities here as to how im
provements should be made, and analysis
of the water has been made at various
times.
Superintendent Gets Report.
According to the report received a few
days ago by A. J. Mueller, superintendent
of the water and electric department,
signed by Engineer J. A. Childs and
Direccor H. A. Whittaker, of the State
Board of Health, the water now is
relatively low in bacterial count and
the absence of B. coli in all samples
collected would indicate that the supply
is free from contamination.
"The field investigations," the report
continues, "showed conditions which
were satisfactory from a sanitary point
of view, and in the analytical results
indications of contamination were not
found. The water from this supply
can be considered safe for public con
sumption in its existing condition."
Samples had been taken by a repre
sentative of the state board from two
weils at the pumping station andJthree
from the distributing system.
Satisfaction Long Delayed.
Technicalities by the state authorities
have delayed satisfactory reports until
the citizens of New Ulm had about given
up hope of getting a cleart bill for their
water supply, which in their own minds
had been pure all of the time.
The report just received implies that
the officers here have just got around
to comply with the recommendations
made by the state board, which was that
sand be placed between a cistern and
well No. 2 at the plant, and a minor
change in the well on the hill west of the
city.
The report suggests that when altera
tions are to be made in the wells at the
station that the pipes be placed at least
six inches above the pump room floor.
Not only are the city officials, but the
citizens as well, glad that the controversy
with the State Board of Health is at an
end at last.
WILL HELP BUILD ROADS
Watonwan county is going to assist
the various townships to build roads in
that county. At a meeting of the coun
ty commissioners last week it was
voted to appropriate $1,000 for each
$3,000 that the township spends in
building new highways or in improving
the old ones.
Graveling of the St. James Butter
field road has been completed and work
on the Long Lake road is now under
way and will be finished soon.
IMPROVEMENTS ON M. & ST. L.
The new management of the Minne
apolis & St. Louis railway, has its
headquarters in Minneapolis, having
been removed from New York. A
number of improvements to be made at
once are announced. Depots and other
property of the company in this part of
the state are to be put in good condition.
A large number of freight cars, loco
motives and other rolling stock have been
purchased recently.
FREIGHT CARS TURNED LOOSE.
Following the complaint of several
shippers the Minnesota Railroad and
Warehouse Commission has ordered the
Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce and
the Equity Grain Exchange to let loose
a large number of cars they are alleged
to have been holding in the Twin Cities.
It is said this will relieve the shortage of
cars in the Northwest for the handling
of grain and potatoes.

NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, OCT. 18, 1916.
ROBBERS RANSACK
STOREAT GOMFREY
ERICKSON & KISRO'S PLACE
ENTERED BY THIEVES
AT NIGHT
ABOUT $500 WORTH OF GOODS
ARE TAKEN LATE FRIDAY
NO CLUE
Another robbery was staged at Com
frey, in the southern part of this county
Friday night, when thieves entered the
general store of Erickson&Kisroat that
place and carried away goods valued at
between $400 and $500. Sheriff William
J. Julius was notified early Saturday,
and Deputy H. F. Jahnke left at once
to make an investigation.
Picked Yale Lock
The robbers gained entrance through
the front door by picking the Yale lock,
and closed the store when they left.
The robbery is supposed to have taken
place sometime after midnight but was
not discovered until the next morn
ing when the store was opened for the
day.
The stolen property consisted mostly
of clothing, including a handsome coon
skin coat, valued at $150, two trunks
and two imitation leather suit cases.
It is believed that the thieves with
their plunder passed through New Ulm
shortly before 4 o'clock Saturday morn
ing. At that time Night Policeman
John Girg saw a Ford automobile, con
taining two men and several trunks,
drive in from the west and turn toward
the Northwestern depot, but believed
it was someone intending to take a
train. When the auto did not return
within a reasonable length of time he
concluded that it must have been some
one traveling through toward Mankato.
Reward is Offered
Erickson & Kisro, through Sheriff
Julius, has offered a reward of $100 for
the arrest and conviction of the thieves,
Not'-j^s âto that effect were mailed to
sheriffs and police officers throughout
this region. The stolen goods are dis
cribed as follows:
Three or four dozen men's dress
trousers, all striped, worth from $3 to
$6 each.
Ten men's suits, blues, brown checks
and greys.
One coonskin coat trimmed with
otter on cuffs and collar, Mc
Kibben make, size 52x52 valued at
$150.
Two leather lined vests, with mole
skin cloth front.
Four pairs men's shoes.
Eleven watches, retail value about
$2.50 each.
One 36-inch traveling trunk, brass
corners.
One 34-inch steamer trunk with brass
corners. Both trunks were provided
with straps.
Two brown imitation leather suit
cases.
"The men suspected were traveling
in an automobile, presumably a Ford,"
says the sheriff's circular, "with the
large trunk tied to the running board on
the left of car."
Mourns Loss of Coat.
Mr. Erickson, of Erickson & Kisro,
mourns the loss of the fur coat more than
all else in the stolen property. He says
that it was the handsomest coonskin
coat that he had ever seen, and he had
planned it for his ov/n use.
No trace so far has been discoverd
of the thieves, except that observed by
Officer Girg, when it is believed they
passed through this city.
BOND ELECTION CARRIES.
At a special election held at Comfrey
last week, the proposition to issue school
bonds by Independent School District,
No. 49, to the amount of $45,000 was
carried by a large majority. The dis
trict is comprised of what was formerly
known as common school districts Nos.
49, 72 and 80 in Brown county, and Nos.
34 and 63 in Cottonwood county. The
money derived from the bonds is to be
used in the construction of a modern
school building.
It is planned to have the building
completed and ready for occupancy at
the beginning of the next school year.
NEW ULM PEOPLE GIVEN A
GENUINE MUSICAL TREAT
New Ulm people,, who filled Turner
theater to its capacity, Wednesday
night were given a real musical treat,
when they listened to a recital by Miss
Elizabeth Spencer, the noted soprano,
assisted by Abraham Bond, violinist.
The entertainment was given through
the efforts of Eugene A. Pfefferle of this
city, the prime object of the recital being
to demonstrate the ability of the Edison
phonograph to "re-create" musical com
positions in competition with human
skill of voice and hand.
Miss Spencer's renditions were given
in unison with the phonograph, and at
frequent intervals when she ceased her
singing the audience, unless they were
watching the movement of her lips, were
unable to distinguish just when she left
off and when she began again.
The violin selections were equally
well rendered, showing what a really
wonderful creation the Edison phono
graph is and demonstrating the fact
that prejudice against "canned music"
is founded on a fallacious idea and is
therefore altogether unjust to the
Edison machine.
MUSIC LOYERS OF
CITY HAYE TREAT
MEYER-TEN BROECK OFFERINGS
PLEASE LARGE AUDIENCE AT
HIGH SCHOOL
FIRST OF LYCEUM COURSE IS
PRONOUNCED SUCCESS BY
ALL PRESENT
The High School Auditorium was
well filled Monday evening by a repre
sentative audience of New Ulm music
lovers to hear the Meyer-Ten Broeck re
cital, the first in the Lyceum course to
be given here this season under the aus
piecs of the Current News Club.
All Are German.
Otto Meyer as usual could not resist
the temptation to address the audience
and said that it was a pleasure to be
here again and that he had asked the
hack driver to take him to the same hotel
that he had stopped at before,
can't remember the name of it, but it
was a German hotel." "Why," the
driver replied that is a description that
would fit all the hotels here." Mr. Meyer
got into the" right place all right for he
looked happy anc[ wore the smile that
would not come off.
Miss Ten Broeck opened the prog
gram with a waltz by Benioski and was
encored. An unexpected treat was
offered when Mr. Meyer brought with
him Miss Louise Trabert, a well known
singer of St. Paul, who sang the follow
ing numbers, in addition to the regular
program:
"Schlupw inkle by Frank LaForge.
(German.)
"Were My Song with Wings Provided.'
"Just Awearying for You."
These songs were so well received
that an encore was necessary and Miss
Trabert responded with John McCoi
mack's song hit, "A Little Bit of
Heaven."
Among the musical numbers played
by Otto Meyer were:
"Rosemarie," arranged by Kreisler,
"Ave Maria," the ever popular "Mo
ments Musical," Schubert's "Stand
chen" "Liebesfreud," a waltz of old
Vienna "Meditation from Thais" "Ca
price Vienese" and "Believe Me If
All Those Endearing Young Charms".
Miss Trabert's other numbers in
eluded "Lift Up Thine Eyes" and "Ave
Maria" in Latin, and "Somewhere A
Voice Is Calling"
Hit of the Evening
The hit of the evening was a de
scriptive piano number by Marie Ten
Broeck, "Guter Mond du Gehst so
Stille," in which the artist skillfully de
picted a couple of lovers, sitting in a
gondola, the wash of the waves on the
shore, the chimes in the distant church
tower and the calm of the water.
Both Mr. Meyer and Miss Ten
Broeck had made themselves very
popular with New Ulm audiences while
here during University Week last sum
mer, and as Prof. H. C. Hess announced
in his opening remarks, the music lovers
of this city considered themselves for
tunate in securing them for a recital in
the Lyceum Course this season.
COUNTY DITCH ESTABLISHED.
At a meeting of the Board of County
Commissioners, at the court house Mon
day, ditch No. 35 was established. The
new ditch lies in the town of Bashaw,
west of Comfrey.
The board will hold a special session
next Tuesday, October 24, at which time
bids for the $45,000 county ditch bonds
recently authorized, will be received and
considered. County Auditor L. G. Vo
gel says a large number of Twin City
and eastern bond houses are expected to
be represented at the meeting.
NUMBER 42
PRESIDENT GIYEN
PRAISE FOR ACTS
REPUBLICAN TELLS AUDIENCE
AT ARMORY WHY HE IS FOR
WILSON.
HON. R. HERRICK ADDRESSES
DEMOCRATS ON ISSUES OF
CAMPAIGN.
"Duty to work the right to live, and
leisure to think are the three fundamental
treasures of the American people,"
declared Hon. Robert Herrick, formerly
lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, in
an address, under the auspices of the
Democratic County Committee, at the
Armory, Thursday evening. A good
sized audience listened attentively to
Mr. Herrick's speech, and' it was the
general opinion that he created a most
favorable impression in the minds of hJs
hearers.
Mr. Herrick, who until the present
campaign has been an ardent Republican,
gave eloquent reasons why he is now
supporting President Woodrow Wilson
for re-election. He scored Charles E.
Hughes, the Republican presidential
nominee, for failure to state his own
stand on the various vital issues of the
day, instead of roaming the country
from coast to coast, doing nothing but
criticise the present administration. For
mer President Roosevelt, of whom Mr.
Herrick said he had been an ardent
admirer until within the past two years,
was also declared insincere in his de
clarations against President Wilson and
his foreign policies.
Roosevelt Would Declare War.
"Mr. Roosevelt would now thrust this
country into war on the side of the
Allies," declared the speaker, and read
extracts from some of the Colonel's
recent speeches to verify this contention.
His denunciation of President Wilson
for refusing to interfere with Germany's
invasion of Belgium was proven by Mr.
Herrick, to be only the usual Roosevelt
buncomb when he read an article written
by the former president for the Outlook
magazine, and appearing in that pub
lication in September, 1914, a few weeks
after the war broke out. The article
written two years ago declared that it
would be worse than folly for the United
States in any way to interfere with
affairs in Europe.
"The 'Old Guard' of the Republican
party is now in the saddle," the speaker
said, "and the progressive members of
that organization are left to shift for
themselves." "This campaign as being
fought out is one of the most cunningly
contrived conspiracies of any party in the
history of the United States," he con
tinued. "The Eastern press and Eastern
capital are both in favor of this country's
entering this war on the side of Great
Britain, and it is only President Wilson's
patriotism and sound judgment that has
kept us out of it."
Adamson Bill Explained.
The Adamson bill, which gave the
railway trainmen of the country an 8
hour work day, and at the same time
saved the tying up of commerce from
ocean to ocean, and preventing untold
hardships to the entire country was ex
plained in a very thorough manner.
Mr. Herrick said that he had always
been an admirer of ex-Senator Beveridge
of Indiana, but that some of the state
ments made by the former senator in his
recent speech at Minneapolis were so
violently false and misleading that he is
now compelled to brand him as a most
vicious falsifier. He referred to Mr.
Beveridge's printed statement denying
that the present administration had kept
us out of war, and other criticisms of the
President, in his Mill City speech.
Mr. Herrick justly praised the ad
ministration for the several items of con
structive legislation which have been
enacted into laws during the past four
years. He spoke especially of the Rural
Credits measure which is designed toÂ»
make it possible for the farmer of small
means to buy and improve a farm of his
own, on long time payments and at low
rates of interest. "This one act," he
said, "is of inestimable value to the
farmers of this country.
Low Interest for Farmers.
"The commission," continued the
speaker, "which has been investigating
the conditions throughout the country,
found that in some places farmers were
paying as high as 60 per cent interest on
their indebtedness. In other places they
were unable to borrow money at any
rate, even on the best of security. Now
they can secure all necessary cash to
carry on their business and make such
improvements as they deem necessary.
