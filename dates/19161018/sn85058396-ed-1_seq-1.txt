I French Inflict Heavy
Loss on Germans in
I Furious Somme Fight
I Official announcements today from
I the entente side report an effective
I stand by the Rumanians against Gen
eral von Falkenhayn's armies along
the Transylvanlan border and the
sanguinary repulse by the French of
; heavy Gorman assaults on the new
French positions In Sallly SallHsel
on the Somme front.
Tho approach of the cold season Is
accompanied by no diminution In ac
tivity In most of the European battle
areas. In some of them, indeed, the
efforts of the belligerents apparently
are being redoubled. This seems
seems notably true along tho eastern
front from Volhynla to Rumania,
whence continuous fighting is report
ed, with a virtual deadlock the result
! so far.
; Further south, the attempt of the
central powers to drlvo a wedge be
tween the Russians and Rumanians
1 near Dorna Watra in the southern
Carpathians is in an uncertain stage.
1 Berlin has reported the capture of
; some heights, but Petrograd claims
the repulse of all the Teutonic at
tacks. Tide of Battle Turns.
Temporarily, at least, tho tide of
battle apparently has changed along
the Transylvanlan border. Berlin has
conceded tho stiffening of the Ruma
nian resistance along this front and
Bucharest advices today declare that
King Ferdinand's troops are making
a sucsessful stand at one point at
f least, in tne reaeai region soutn ox
1 Kronstadt and are pushing General
von Falkenhayn's armies back.
From tho Rumanian view point all
the military news Is reassuring, is Is
declared.
Russian troops In force are reported
helping the Rumanians to defend the
passes from Transylvania into their
territory.
German Attacks Fall.
On the Somme front German at
tacks were delivered against the
French line both north and south of
the Somme. Three assaults by the
Germans upon the French in Sallly
j SallHsel are declared by Paris to have
been repulsed with heavy losses to
the Germans who also were repelled
after they had gained a footing in a
French first line trench near Berny-
en-Santerrc, south of the river.

IRISH QUESTION
BEFORE HOUSE
System of Government in Ire
land Inconsistent and Re
sponsible for Trouble.
London, Oct. IS, 11 a. m. The Irish
question was again brought to the
fore in the house of commons today
with the Introduction by John Red
mond of a motion criticising the sys.
tern of government of the Island.
The motion reads:
"That the system of government at
present maintained In Ireland Is In
consistent with the principles where
for the allies are fighting In Europe,
and is, or has been, mainly responsi
ble for the recent unhappy events
and for the present state of feeling In
that country."
Since Mr. Redmond gave notice of
his Intention to attack the govern
ment, the Irish leaders have held a
number of conferences with Baron
Wimborne, lord-lieutenant of Ireland,
but these probably had more to do
with the suggestion of extension of
conscription to Ireland than with tho
grievances arising from continuance
of martial law and the failure to real
lze all those arrested during the up
rising in Ireland last spring. How
ever, tho question of conscription did
not come under Mr. Redmond's mo
tion. It doubtless will be discussed tomor
row when the whole subject of tho
man power of the empire comes un
der review.
John Rawlinson moved as an amend
ment to the Redmond motion the fol
lowing: "Having regard for the importance
of the United Kingdom, and Ireland
i combining with the rest of the empire
In presenting a united front to the
enemy, it is not desirable at tho pres.
cnt time to discuss controversial mat
ters of domestic policies."

VISCOUNT GREY

Washington in Querulous,
Captious Mood Makes De
mands Not Legally
Tenable.
BITTERLY ASSAIL ACTS
Behavior Regarding Recent
U-53 Incident Stirs Anger
of British Lords.
London, Oct. 18, 11:37 a. m. The
statement of Viscount Grey, the for
eign secretary, to the house of lords
yesterday regarding operations of bel
ligerent warships off tho coast of the
United States, caused a considerable
stir, says the London correspondent of
the Liverpool Post.
"It has thrown a most disagreeablo
light upon the attitude of the Ameri
can government in the early stages of
the war," the correspondent com
ments. "Washington is shown In a
querulous, captious mood, making de
mands which it admitted were not
legally tenable.
"The incident referred to Is now
ancient history and might well be for
gotten, but In view of the extraordi
nary proceedings in connection with
the TJ-53 incident are spoken very bit
terly of the behavior of tho American
government The stories mentioned
by Charles Beresford and Earl Grey
seem to have some foundation, and if
they are authentic the foreign secre
tary should be pressed to demand an
explanation.
"We are awaiting some announce
ment from tho administration in
Washington after they have completed
the inquiries which Viscount Grey as
sumes they are making, but there is
no evidence that any such Inquiries
are in progress and tho general feel
ing is that the matter will have to be
pressed a little further."

REGENT STREET
NOT DESTROYED
American Arriving in New
York Declares Zeppelin
Story Is Untrue.
New York, Oct 18. Edgar Rickard,
an American, arrived in New York
yesterday on the steamer Ryndam,
said today in reference to the Zeppe
lin attack on London of September
23:
"I lived within a few blocks of Re
gent street until October 5. No huild
ing on Regent streot was oven struck.
There was no damage whatever In
the metropolitan district except at
Brixton."
"Eye witnesses state that more
than 100 buildings were badly dam
aged, some of them being completely
wrecked," says the news agency. "Tho
damage Is estimated at more than
12,000,000. Regent street, London,
which 1b tho main artery of com
merce, was for the most part laid in
ruins. In a southern BUburb of Lon
don an ammunition factory was blown
up.
"In Liverpool a bridge and tracks
were damaged so badly that it will bo
Impossible to use thorn for a long

Thames were damaged.
"Tho Grimsby barracks were hit
and more than 400 soldiers wero

factories and railroad stations at
Leeds. An ammunition factory and
other buildings of Portsmouth wero
struck, twelve cars loaded with horses
wero destroyed, a dock was damaged,
and railroad cars were blown up."
London Papers Quoted.
The German nowe agency
gives quotation attributed to
a London newspaper in which
the theory Is advanced that the
purpose of Zeppelin attacks is not
the killing of women and children, but
the curtailment of the production of
ammunition by causing the suspen
sion of work in ammunition factories
after warnings of Zeppelin raids have
been given, rather than by the de
struction of factories. The news
agency says this newspaper stated
thousands of working hours wero
lost In one week and continues:
''German papers compare these re
sults with the affirmations of Brit
ish papers that the air attacks caused
no damage. They point out the fact
that the British government blocked
the cables of tho Hearst International
News service because It sent out 'In
correct reports to New York about
the successes of German airships.' "
Tho official British account of tho
Zeppelin attack on the night of Sep
tember 23 issued the following night
said no reports had been received of
any military damage. It was said a
considerable number of small dwell
ing houses and shopB, two factories, a
railway station and some empty rail
way trucks were destroyed or dam
aged, and that thirty persons were
killed and 110 wounded.
Berlin, Oct 18, by wireless to Say
vllle. The Berliner Tageblatt de
clares that a London police court has
absolved a dairyman who had been
accused of adding water to the milk
sold by him. The dairyman declared,
according to the newspaper, that his

pelin attacks that the milk was spoiled.

NORWAY CLAIMS
RIGHTTOWATERS
Informs Allies of Govern
ment's Attitude Toward Bel
ligerent Submarine Boats.
London, Oct 18. 10:40 a. m. Reu
ter's Christianla correspondent says
Norway has informed the entente al
lies that it does not recognize that it
is its duty to prohibit passage through
or sojourn in Norwegian waters by
belligerent submarines. The Norweg
ian note is In response to the mem
orandum of the entente powers to
neutrals suggesting that belligerent
submarines should bo excluded from
neutral waters.
Tho Norwegian government de
clares it considers it has the right to
prohibit submarines, designed for wnr
purposes and belonging to belliger
ents from passing through Norwegian
territorial waters or sojourning In
them, and says it mado use of this
right in issuing tho royal docvop of
October 13, under which belligerent
submarines aro forbidden to traverse
Norwegian waters, except in cases of
emergency, when thoy must remain
-upon the surface and fly the nation
al flag. The decree also provides
that mercantile submarines are to bo
allowed in Norwegian waters only In
a surface position In full daylight and
when flying the national colors.
Norway does not find that it is Its
duty, aB against any of tho bellig
erents, to prohibit such passing or so
journ. Concerning commercial sub
marines, tho now Norwegian regula
tions Impose no prohibition, it is
pointed out, so far as concerns ar
rival or sojourn of such submarines
under tho conditions designated in
the royal decree.

People Feel Best Interests De
pend Upon Preservation
of Friendship.
ASK FAIR TREATMENT
Christian Missionaries Doing
Much to Ameliorate Social
Conditions in Orient
St Louis, Mo., Oct 18. Japanese
people feel that tho best Interests
of their country depend upon their I
preservation of friendly relations with
the United States, tho Rt Rev. H. H.
St. George Tucker, bishop of Kyoto,
told delegates to tho general conven
tion of the Protestant Episcopal
church today.
Bishop Tucker spoko at a joint ses
sion of the two houses, reviewing the
scope and methods of tho church's
foreign mission work.
"I have had large opportunities for
meeting Japanese of all classes," he
said, "and I have never heard the
opinion that there is any essential
conflict between tho interests of Ja
pan and America exprossed.
"Tho only possible cause of trou
ble would bo in a conviction on the
part of the Japanese that they were
being unjustly discriminated against
and their national honor was involv
ed. Even In regard to the question
of emigration of the Japanese in this
country, tho Japanese government has
shown willingness to meet the
wishes of America by the so-called
'gentleman's agreement'
Japs Want Fair Treatment.
"It has undertaken to prevent fur
ther emigration of Japanese to Am
erica and statistics show in the nast
two or three years they have carried
out this agreement All they ask is
fair, undiscriminating treatment of
the Japanese, at present residents of
America."
Bishop Tucker asserted that Occi
dental thought and lifo is penetrating
the countries in the Orient in an ever
increasing volume and said that the
purpose of Christianity there is to
receive not only tho intellectual life
but the idealistic side.
"While tho Japanese, whose think
ers realize that some form of relig
ion is essential to safeguard the mor
al life of tho peoplo," ho said, "aro
not yet persuaded that Christianity
is best fitted to meet their need, our
progress in Japan gives every reason
that in the future the peoplo will rec
ognize its value."
Missionaries In China.
In speaking of China, Bishop Tuck
er declared that Christian missionar
ies in that country have done much
to ameliorate social conditions, build
ing hospitals, establishing medical
schools and encouraging the Chinese
to study modern medical methods.
Similar work has been accomplished
in Japan, particularly in establishing
a leper colony.
"One large effect of Christian mis
sionary work lies in avoiding misun
derstandings, promoting a better ap
preciation on tho part of eastern peo
ple of the attitude of the western na
tions," he continued. "There seems
to be in this country a feeling that
the development of Japanese interests
in China constitute a peril to tho peo
ple of tho United States. I do not
believe that all of Japan can ever bo
Christianized, but there seems to be
no peril in Japanese development of
China."
Today's joint session over which
the Rt Rev. R. Graves, bishop of
Shanghai presided, will be devoted to
conference on "what the church is
trying to do in her work abroad."
Joint Business Session.
At a business session which pre
ceded the joint meeting, announce
ment was made that a resolution had
been adopted by the House of Bish
ops and concurred in by the House
of Deputies, providing for tho ap
pointment of a commission "to pro
mote the spread for tho desire for
peace in the world and international
friendship and to relate their opera
tions to the world alliance for pro
moting international friendship
through the churches. The commis
sion will be composed of ten bishops,
ten clergymen and ten laymen.
Announcement was mado in the
house of bishops that it had received
a request from Huyso Wolcott Yeat-man-BIggs,
bishop of Worcester, Eng
land, asking for an expression of opin
ion as to when the next Lambeth
conference could be held and that
they had fixed 1919 as a possible
year. The Lambeth conference is a
decennial conference of leaders of
the Church of England and has been
postponed because of tho war. It was
explained that tho request of tho
Bishop of Worcester was merely for
an expression of opinion from the
American church which does not par
ticipate in the gathering.

CREW SELECTED
FOR THEARIZONA
Men Drawn From Older Bat
tleship to Man the New
Superdreadnought.
GREAT 14-INCH GUNS
Throw Ten Tons at a Broad
side Distance of Twenty
Miles.
New York, Oct 18. The crew of the
now Buperdreadnought Arizona, which
takes her place today in the battle
lino of the Atlantic fleet with her sis
ter ship, the Pennsylvania, came from
the older battleships Kansas, New
Hampshire and Vermont, recently
transferred to the Atlantic reserve
fleet at Philadelphia. An officer ot
the Arizona pointed out that the Ari
zona's 12 14-inch guns th'row 6,000
pounds more to a broadside than was
contained in tho combined broadsides
of the Kansas, Vermont and New
Hampshire. The Arizona's broadside
weighs about 10 tons and can be
hurled about 20 miles. The other
three ships combined carried 12 12
inch guns in their main battery.
"The Arizona Is too big and impor
tant to risk a chance with a green
crew," said one of the Arizona's offi
cers. "The only sensible thing to do
was to give us a trained crew and the
only place to get these men was out
of tho active fleet. As the Kansas.
New Hampshire and Vermont were
going into the reserve, where they be
long, they furnished a majority of the
men."
The Connecticut, the sole remaining
vessel of the pre-dreadnought type
now in the Atlantic fleet, is destined
to go in tho reserve fleet, as the fleet
has been reorganized so far as Its
first fighting lino is concerned, into
an all-dreadnought fleet When the
Idaho and Mississippi go Into commis
sion noxt year there will be 19 vessels
of the dreadnought class in the four
active battle divisions of the fleet
MANAGING THE
SOIL FOR PROFIT
Soil Expert Advises More Ef
ficient Work and Suitable
Plant Food.
Indianapolis, Oct. IS. Delegates at
tending the thirty-sixth annual session
of the Farmers' National congress,
which is being held here today, made
a trip of inspection to the Moreland
Biological Farm, near here, where
Prof. Henry G. Bell, of Chicago, spoke
on the subject, "Managing Soil for
Profit"
Professor Bell stated that it had
been demonstrated reliably that great
profit in increased crop yields and
products of superior quality accrues
to farmers when fertilizers of suitable
analysis are properly used on soil in
good physical condition.
"Everybody knows," continued the
soil export, "that farm labor is becom
ing scarcer and less reliable. Fortu
nately more efficient farm machinery
Is finding its way on the market. This
in itself is a great aid in meeting the
labor problem. Approximately as
much labor, exclusive of the actual
handling of the products at harvest,
has to bo expended on a wheat field
whether it yields 10, 20 or 30 bushels
to tho acre. If the addition of a lib
eral amount of suitable plant food will
obtain the higher yield, Is It not the
essenco of good business to mako tho
investment in fertilizer?"
Other speakers on the program to
day included GIfford Plnchot, who
was to talk on "National Control of
Water Power," and Dr. H. J. Wheeler,
former director of the Rhode Island
experiment station, on "Farming the
Air."

Secretary of the Treasury Mc

HUGHES INDEFINITE
Roosevelt Out as Spokesman
of Party Urging Country to IH
Assume Bellicose ll
Attitude.
Chicago, Oct. 18. Praise for Presl-
dent Wilson's diplomatic and legisla- IH
tlve achievements and charges that jH
"Wall street always has dominated 1
the Republican party," and that vie- jH
tory for that party next month would
endanger the country's prosperity,
were voiced here today by William G. jH
McAdoo, secretary of the treasury, be- H
fore a non-political meeting in a down-
town theatre. jH
"The American people are being IH
asked to put in peril the peace and ll
prosperity the country is now enjoy- IH
ing under President Wilson by turn
ing their government over to the in-
experienced Mr. Hughes and the or- H
ganlzed band of Incompatible ele-
meats which aro supporting him," IH
said Mr. McAdoo.
Hughes Stilt Indefinite.
"For two months they have con- IH
demned every act of the Democratic
administration in the most unfair and
untruthful manner, but the American
people are still without a definite an- IH
swer from Mr. Hughes as to what IH
they will do with the government if IH
they get possession of it
"The only definite thing we have
had in the campaign came from Colo
nel Roosevelt who said at Battle
Creek, discussing the Lusltania: fH
'"You ask me what I would have
done? I would have seized every in- IH
terned German ship.' " jH
Mr. McAdoo then quoted Germany's IH
declaration on Portugal because of IH
seizures of German ships by that IH
country, ana aaaea: ih
Roosevelt Act Would Cause War. JH
"Mr. Roosevelt's action would have jJ
resulted in war between the United jJ
States and Germany. And now comes IH
Mr. Hughes and admits as far as he IH
is ever definite, his accord with the
bellicose attitude of Mr. Roosevelt jH
This is shown by his reply at Louis- jJ
ville to the question as to what he jJ
would have done in the Lusltania IH
case. He said, in substance, that he IJ
would have threatened the kaiBer so H
effectively that 'the Lusltania would H
never have been sunk.' This is char- flH
acteristlc evasion, for Mr. Hughes was
asked what he would have done after jl
the Lusltania had been sunk. I chal
lege him to answer that question.
"Who can doubt that If Mr. Hughes
is made president, Mr. Roosevelt will
be the dominating influence and dl
rcct our foreign and domestic poll-
Easy to Provoke War. J
"A president has It in his power
to plunge the country into war at any IH
moment A single misstep, a rash
act or blunder on his part Is all that
is necessary. It does not require
courage or statesmanship to provoke jH
war. Any wild man, or blunderer. In
the presidential chair can precipitate
such a calamity."
Taking up domestic affairs, Mr.
McAdoo said that the Democratic ad
ministration had destroyed the sys
tern "by which the reserve money ot
the banks of the country was con
centrated principally In New York
City." He believed that Mr. Hughes,
"If elected intends to repeal the fed-
eral reserve act," and establish a cen- IH
tral reserve bank, "because the Re- jH
publican party always has stood for JH
