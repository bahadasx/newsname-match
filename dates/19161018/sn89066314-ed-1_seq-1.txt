By United PnM.
ATHENS, Oct. 18. Venixelos lead
era have deoided to call upon the
Allies to recognize formally the new
provisional government . favoring
Greece's entry into the war. This de
cision was reached after two days of
serious disturbances in the, capital, 'in
which mobs threatened to attack the
Allied marines.
Two diplomatic commissions were
organized. They will present the case
of the provisional government to the
Ailies, declaring that only V formal
recognition of this government will
save Greece from chaos.
Negotiations have been begun in
formally with the United States to
permit the recruiting of Greek armies.
Recruiting agents will be sent to the
United States, to Egypt, and to Cyprus
ii the desired permission is obtained.
Threatened with attack by a huge
cfowd of anti-Ally demonstrators, the
French marine force that occupied the
municipal theater has abandoned the
building and encamped in the Zeap
paleon garden, near the royal palace.
Greek troops are still patrolling the
town, and a Greek batallion to guard
ing the royal palace.
The situation is most critical. Anti-
Ally leaders are working among the
crowds, denouncing the Allies for
seizing the Greek warships, and at
tempting to stir the mob to a demon
stration of hostility to the Allied
sailors .Athens is practically under
martial law."
