E Hughes, f"'i"K ft friclldy aul',ncc
wrinkled with hecklers, tonight re
irtictl in answer to a question as to
whether he would repeal the Adam
son law if fleeted president, that "a
wrrender could not he. repealed."
Mr Hughes was asked what he
would have done to avert tlie threat
ened railroad strike.
"If arbitration had heen refused,'
Mr. Hushes replied, "I should have
gone right to the American peup.e, j
stated the farts and put the respon-,
gibility where It belonged.
" should at the same time," Mr.
Hughes continued, "have secured a
commission of inquiry so Impartial,
so fair, as to command the respect of!
the eniiro country and directing pub-
He opinion to that end that there is j
no croup of men in the United States j
that would have dared hold up the j
Instrumentalities of commerce if
that were done." j
Thd heckler still had another ques
tion lo ask.' --.
"Mr. Hushes," he said, "any quos-j
tion that Is asked here is asked with
no enmity toward the candidate of
the republican party. You would
hav. d nr i ll (hat within twenty-i

the president asking for an imiuiry.
A resuli.,..,., was asked In the senate
for an inquiry, and was laid on the
table. For months the business men
of the United States asked for an in
quiry as to this very matter, und the
crisis was allowed to be developed,
when It was unnecessary that it
should have been developed and there
was adequate time to ascertain what
the facts were."
Great Confusion.
The heckling was attended by the
utmost confusion. The audience,
which had cheered and Applauded
loudly in the earlier parts of .Mr.
Hushes' address, apparently was in
censed at the interruptions, and there
wore many fries of "put him out,"
"sit down," and "shut up." As the I
nominee replied to each question,
the audience cheered its approval.
It was necessary after each Interrup
tion fur Mr Hushes to step forward
and request that the heckler he al
lowed to proceed.
In the first part of his speech, Mr.
Hughes also was heckled.
Mr. Hughes cited his record as life
insurance investigator and as gov
ernor r.f Now York, In answer to the
declaration that his election might

Has Tilt With Heckler.
A man with a big stick in the gal
lery sought to heckle the nominee on
labor affairs. He asked a question
that apparently was misunderstood in
the confusion and Mr. Hughes, amid
a roar of applause, read what the
Legislative .News, the official organ
of organled labor, had to say in
praise of Vds record as governor.
When the applause died, the man
"rose again. The crowd would have
Put him out and fur more than a
minute the audb-nce was a tumult of
confusion.
Mr. Hughes, with outstretched
Wis, sought to quiet the crowd. He
finally made himself heard.
"Let the gentleman ask any ques
tion he wants to," the nominee said.
What do you want to say, sir?"
Among hisses and boos, the man
asked his question, waving the stick
in his hand.

lost their lives in a fire which de
stroyed two factories in the manufac
turing section of Queens boiouuh late
to:ay, with a material loss estimated
at Jiiafl.OOO.
The charred bodies were not found
until tho flames had been extin
guished and firemen were pouring
water into the ruins of the buildings.
Search is being made tonight for two
persons still missing, but it is believed
thev perished. All those burned were
employed in the plant, of (tie (lakes

the flames started. The known dead:

The. fire started among chemicals
on the first floor of the Lakes build
ing, and spread with such rapidity
that the office force was trapped on
the second floor.
In addition to the office building,
five one-story buildings of the Cakes
company were destroyed. Krom these
buildings, the fire spread to the As
toria Veneer Mill and Lumber yard,
where many thousands of feet of lum
ber was destroyed.
The police have barned that an
tlectrician at work on the first, floor
of the dve-making plant, making i e
pairs to the electric liuht fixtures,
cropped a ladder which struck a jar
of chemicals that burst into flames
There were six young women and
the three men on flie second floor
when the fire began. Not one of
them has been seen since. A fr"'-l
stairway led from the upper floor to
the first floor on the inside of the
building. There also were two iron
fire escapes and one sletl st.nrwa
. h niltside.
A half-dozen windows were located
close to where the young women were

The question concerning the Gor

oPois. Huron lleicsford asked whether

Of filial Complaint.
The official complaint staled that
the llrilish goveriiineul was aware
that the l ulled State government had
,ihvas regarded the practice of bellig
eient cruisers patrolling tho American
coast in close proximity to the terri
torial waters of the I'nited (States and
making the neighborhood a station for
their observations, as inconsistent with
the treatment to be expected from tho
naval vessels of a friendly power in
Utile of war, and had maintained that
the consequent maintenance of such
proceedings to the freedom of Ameri
can coinmi icc was vexatious and uu
courteous to the Pnlted States.
"We assume that tho Mew of the
Pulled Stale government is still that
contained In their dispatch of Octo
ber 4, 1S70."
Viscount Gitey quoted this to )tlu!
effect that the Pnlted Stales govern
ment would regard as nit unfriendly
act the hovering of belligerent vessels
near the American const In tho track
of commerce to American potts, with
Intent to intercept entente merchant
men. In conclusion, he said:
.Matter in Mate of SiisH'iisc.
"I will sum up the situation by ('
lug this: The whole matter seems to
be In a statu of suspense as far as
we at concerned. It Is evidently the
ci.se that u German submarine visited
a Pnlted Stales port und subsequent
ly sank llrilish and neutral vessels
off the American const. We do not
know what precautions were taken to
prevent the submarine from obtain
ing supplii'H or lufoi inatlon from the
newspapers, or othetwi.se, as to the
movement of merchant ships off the
coast. Nor do wo know whether
American ships of war facilitated the
operations of the submarine by get
ting out of the way us reported In the
press.
"It is only the I'nited States gov-
eminent and their officials who can
authoritatively ascertain all the facts
and until We know what the facts ac
tuullv were, and what view the Pnlted
Slates government takes of the pro
ceedings of the German submarine,
we do not propose to muKc an otric lal

the subject, which,

"Of course, the allien altogether

danger of permitting submarines of
