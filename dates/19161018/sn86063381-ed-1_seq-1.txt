to Connect Highway With Red

DISTANCE FROM HIGHWAY
TO AGENCY IS 27 MILES
Will Ask for an Appropriation of
$20,000 From the Federal
Government. 1
Thief River Falls, Minn., Oct. 18.
An appropriation of $20,000 from the
federal government for the improver
ment of the road leading from the
Jefferson highway at Winsor, to the
Red Lake agency, thence around the
southern and eastern shore of the
lower Red Lake to the point on the
narrows connecting both lakes, will
be sought by the various commercial
clubs of cities on the Jefferson high
way between Bemidji and Thief
River Falls, together with the Com
mercial club of Crookston.
Largest Body of Water.
The fact that Red lake is the larg
est body of fresh water in North
America outside of the Great Lakes,
is one of the advantageous points that
will be brought to the attention of
congress. Then again there are some
exceedingly fine beaches along the
shore at places readily accessible and
the stand of virgin pine on the point
at the narrows is one of the few such
growths remaining untouched by hu
man hand.
Clearwater to Aid.
The distance from the Jefferson
highway to the agency is about 27
miles, and all but sixes miles of this
distance is within the Red Lake In
dian reservation. Clearwater county
is willing to improve this short dis
tance if the federal government will
properly do its share. There is a
stretch of about thirty miles beyond
the agency proper to the point on the
narrows which would also come under
the government supervision.
This step was advocated at a meet
ing of representatives of commercial
clubs held in Red Lake Falls Monday
afternoon, at which several cpmmer
cial clubs along the highway: werj$*
represented. The resolution as out
lined above will be presented to Con
gressman Steenerson, who will no
doubt give the same his careful at
tention at the proper time.

KOOCHICHING PROBE
International Falls, Minn., Oct. 18.
Hating to quit and desert his
friends under fire, District Engineer
Ogaard told Commissioner Brown,
who is taking testimony in the Koo
chiching county probe here, Monday
afternoon, that he decided to stick
with them to the end. Previously
County Attorney Ogaard had testified
that Engineer Ogaard had misrepre
sented him in testifying that he
(Jevne) recommended him to accept
Highway No. 34 with a reduction of
25 cents a yard for uncompleted sur
facing.
A settlement was made at the 25
cent reduction whereas Ogaard had
previously stated at a meeting of
Birchdale taxpayers that surfacing
would cost $1 per yard. The total
area on which the 25 cent reduction
was made amounted to 19,772 yards.
JeVne testified that he had not giv
en any advice on the road work, had
drawn no contracts nor otherwise
been connected with the highway
building.
Minutes of the county board of
commissioners showed that the same
day he had written the commission
as stated above, he had recommended
the acceptance of the road. The loss
to the county ..was approximately
4130,000.
The purpose of the investigation,
instigated on petition of county tax
payers, is to show the loss to the
county by actions of the-board, coun
tjy auditor and engineer in order to
find a basis for suits to recover the
amounts.
BEADY FOR SECOND
VISIT TO MICHIGAN
Makes Big Impression With Audi
ences in Iowa City in Fight-
iugTrim.
(By United Press)
Chicago, 111., pet. 18.Charles B.
Hughes is ready for his second ex
cursion into Michigan. He is in his
best fighting trim since he was se
lected standard bearer. He was
pleased with the impression made on
big audiences at Sioux City last night
when he answered hecklers.
Sioux City,, Ia. Oct. 18.~-eharles
B. Hiighes, fa,cing a friendly audience
sprinkled with hecklers, last night
replied In answer to a question as to
whether he would repeal the Adam
son bill, if elected president that f%
surrender could not be repealed."
Mr. Hughes was asked what- he
would hav&done to avert the threat
ened railroad strike.
Mr. Hughes cited his record as life
insurance investigator, and as gover
nor of New York, in answer to the
declaration that his election might
mean the setting up of '"invisible
government" in the United States.
Asks Question.
A man with a big stick in the gal
lery sought to heckle the nominee on
labor affairs. He asked, a question
that apparently was misunderstood in
the confusion and Mr. Hughes, amid
a roar of applause, read what the
Legislative News, the official organ
of organized labor, had to say in
praise of his record as governor,
When the applause died, the man
arose again. The crowd would have
put him out and for more than a min
ute the audience was in a tumult of
confusion.
:Mr.r ljughes, with outstretched
hands, sought to quiet the crowd. JHe^
fiW^&ad hft^f^
''Let the gehetleman ask any ques
tion he wants to," the nominee ^aid.
"What do you say
Among hisses the man asked his
question, waving the stick in his
hand.
Stated in Facts.
"If arbitration had._been refused,**
Mr. Hughes replied, "I should have
gone right to the .American people,
stated the facts, and put the responsi
bility whiere it belongs."
"I should at the same time," Mr.
Hughes continued," have secured a
commission of inquiry so impartial,
so fair as to command the respect of
the entire country and directing pub
lic opinion to that end. There is no
group of men in the United States
that would have dared hold up the
instrumentalities of commerce if that
were done."
