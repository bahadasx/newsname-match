BAK§R LIBELS PATRIOTS.
Denver Historical Members Criticise
Slur Cast on Continental Army.
Denver, Oct. 18.—Members and offi
cials of the national patriotic societies
in Denver expressed emphatic con
demnation of Secretory of War Baker's
statement regarding the continental
army.
"As president of the 'Washington
Lincoln Memorial Association, and
knowing that I voice the sentiments of
many thousand members," said Dr.
Clarkson N. Guyer of the Sons of the
American Revolution, "I resent the re
marks of Secretary Baker. To say
that the patriots were as bad charac
ters as the iMexicajis Is to voice the
sentiments*1 of the Tories who desired
to ruin their own country."
Dr. Shaw Duncan, professor of his
tory at Denver university, pronounced
the statement of Secretary Baker "an
"unwarranted exaggeration." The sol
dier of the American revolution was a
taan of a much higher/type than the
Mexican of'"today. Dr. Duncan thought
C. C. Eckha^t, professor of history
at the University of Colorado, said:
"'We can not deny that there were acts
'of vandalism on the part of the Amerl
'ca soldiery, but they were not a na
ture to place them on ,a level with the
"barbarism that prevails in Mexico."
Here are some other opinions:
J. C. Starkweather of the Sons of
the Revolution—"I am surprised that
Secretary Baker would make such a
'statement It was unfounded."
Dr. George Vosburgh. chaplain of
the Sons of the Revolution—"All tftat
Is necessary Is to publish the state
ment in black type and add, 'This
needs no comment'
Mrs. John Campbell of the Daugh
ters of tbe American Revolutidn-^-'Tt is
not fair to cast a reflection upon all
the men who fought Between the
American army and,.the Mexican army
there is no comparison."
Mrs. J. N. HSall, of. the Daughters of
the confederacy—'It is the individual
rather than the army that commits
depredations. It is'not tight to make
so general a statement"
Mrs. J. R. Donaldson of the Daugh
ters of the Revolution—"In every
Country at warvsucft thing* have been
done by individuals, but the army can
-riot be blamed for It Dhe statement is
too sweeping."

Athens, Oct 18.—After demonstra

landing of French marines, a delega
tion of six persons called at the Amer

one by Daniel Webster said the strug

NORWAY DOES NOT BAR SUBS.
Not Nation's Duty to Prohibit Passage
Thru Watsrs, Says Nota,
London, Oct 18. Reuter'* Chris
tiania correspondent says ^Norway has
informed the entente allies that it does
not recognize is its duty to prohibit
passage thru or. sojourn in Norwegian
waters by belligerent submarines. Tbe
Norwegian note is in response to tbe
memorandum of entente powers to
neutrals suggesting that submarines
should be excluded from neutral wa
ters.
Tbe Norwegian government dgblares
It considers it has the right tp^rofilbit
s\tu£arinu .designed tot war purpose*
and belonging to b^UlgeretltB -Xrohf
passing thru ^orwegianr^waters or BO
Joufning in them, and said it made
u*e of this right in issuing the royal
,-decree "of Oct. 13, under which belliger
ent submarines are forbidden to -tra
verse Norwegian waters, except' in
cases of mergency when they must re
main upon the sutface and fly the na
tional flag.,. The decree also provides
that mercantile submarines are to be
allowed in Norwegian waters only in a
surface position and in full daylight
and flying the national colors.
On the other hand, the government
doest not find that it Uj its duty as
against any of the belligerents to pro
hibit such passage or sojourn. Con
cerning merchant submarines the new
provisions impose no prohibition so far
«s concerns arrival or sojourn of such
submarines.
U. S. TOBACCO CARGOES HELD UP.
Charge Made Shipments Fail to Com
ply With Arrangement on Destination.
Liondon, Oct.
18.—Large
consign
ments of tobacco from the United
states for Dutch and Scandinavian
parts are being held here on the claim
of the government that they fall to
comply with the recent arrangement
under which cargoes paid for before
Aug. 4 and shipped prior to Aug. 80
might proceed to neutral destinations.
Many American tobacco shippers
who have their own representatives in
Eurqpe with whom they do a whole-^
sale business, shipped to them under
the Impression that the new order
would permit such action. The gov
ernment however, contends that proof
must be furnished that the cargoes
were .paid for before Aug. 4 by the ac
tual European buyers.
May Cause Heavy .Lessee,
"Washington, Oct. 18.-lGreat Brit
ain's detention'of American tobacco
shipments is expected here to cause
heavy losses to members of the trade
in this country unless a modification of
the British ruling can be secured. The
state department already has made in
formal representations, and officials
said tonight they hoped to clear up the
misunderstanding to the satisfaction of
American interests.
Besides the consignments reported
held In Lo/idon, American tobacco val
ued at* more than tl,-500,000 Is detained
aboard British ships and in ware
houses at Danish ports on the charge
that its shipment violated the shipping
arrangements.
The interpretation applied to the ar
rangement by British officials' was as
much a surprise to officials here as It
was to tbe American shippers.
In her previous agreements for .pas
sage of shipments thru the blockade
lines, It was declared today. Great,
Britain never attempted to apply tjje
doctrine of ultimate sale.
The understanding here was that
only a bona fide sale to European
wholesalers would be required In the
case of the tobacco consignment^

Chicago, Oct 18.—Charles E. Hughes
spent virtually the entire day today en
route from Sloux City, lowta, to points
In Michigan, where he will speak late
today and tonight The nominee's
special train left Sioux City at 11
o'clock last night and reached Chicago
at 11:30 today. A stay of an hour and
a quarter in Chicago, due to switching
the train, was necessary.
Mr. Hughes' first speech of the day,
a rear platform address, was at Nlles,
where he remained fifteen minutes. He
Is due to reach Kalamazoo at 4 p. m.,
and to remain there an hour and a

and for his departure early tomorrow
morning for other Michigan cities and
Younigstown, O., where he will make
the last speech of his third trip tomor

McAdoo Praises Wilson.
Praise for President Wilson's diplo
matic and legislative achievements and
charges that "Wall street has always
dominated the republican party", and
that victory for that party next month
would endanger the' country's prosper
ity was voiced here today by William
G. MoAdoo, secretary of the treasury,
before a noon political meeting In a
downtown theater.
"The American people are being
asked to put in peril the peace and
prosperity the country is now enjoying
under President "Wilson by turning
their government over to the Inexperi
enced Mr. Hughes and the organised
band of Incompatible elements which
are supporting him," said Mr. MoAdoo.
"In one or two months they have
condemned every act of the democratic
administration in the most unfair and
untruthful majiner but the-American
people -atJJl. are^lthout a definite an
swer from Mr. Hughes as to what they
get possession of it.
"Tbe only definite thing we- have liad
came from Colonel Roosevelt who
said, discussing the LuSltanla.* "You
ask me what I would have dorte, I,
woufd have seized every interned Ger
man ship.'"
Demands Answer From Hughes.
Mr. 'MoAdoo then referred to the
seizure by Portuguese of German
ships, and added:
''Mr. Roosevelt's actfon would have
resulted In war between the United
States and Germany. Now comes Mr.
Hughes, who shows what he would
have done In the same case. He said
in substance that he would have
threatened the kaiser so effectively
that 'the Lusltania would never have
been sunk'. This is characteristic
evasion, for Mr. Hughes was asked
what he would hfive done after the
Lusltania had been sunk. I challenge
him to ansiwer that question.
"Wiho can doubt that If Mr. Hughes
Is made president, Mr. Roosevelt will
be the dominating Influence and direct
c.ur foreign and domestic policies."
Taking up domestic affairs Mr. Mc
Adoo said the democratic administra
tion had destroyed the system by
•which the reserve money of the banks
of the country was concentrated In the
banks of New York. Mr. Hughes, if
elected, he said, Intends to repeal the
teserve act and establish a central
bank.
