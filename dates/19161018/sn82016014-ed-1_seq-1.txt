Athens. Oct. 18. The French force
of marines that was threatened by a
huf-e mob that gathered about the mu
nicipal theater, abandoned the theater
and encamped in the Zeappalon gar
dens near the royal palace. A bat
talion of Greek infantry has surround
ed the palace. Thus far there has
been no serious clash between the al
lied troops and the anti-ally crowds.
Several thousand Greeks, gathered in
the streets near the square surround
ing the threater, watched the transfer
of the French marines but there was
no dem -"Titration except an occasional
shout.
The allies have detained twenty-five
carloads of ammunition at "Volo, in
Thessaly, which was destined for the
interior of Thessaly. It is suspected
that the ammunition was being
shipped to enemies of allied powers.
Deny King Has Fled.
Athens is virtually under martial
law. All sorts of alarming rumors
are in circulation, but cool heads are
attempting to prevent a. clash between
French sailors and the civilian dem
onstrators that would develop into
street fighting with most serious con
sequences. Reports that King Constantine has
f)t-d. are denied by Greek officials.
They declare the king returned to Ta
toi palace Monday night after review
ing the Greek marines and attending a
cabinet council at which a proclama
tion, calling upon the soldiers to re
main loyal, was drafted.
The trouble began Monday after
noon. Great crowds had gathered to
watch Greek sailors from the ships
taken over by the allies pass in review
before King Constantine. As the pa
rade ended and the king took his de
parture amid cheers, several shouts of
"Down with Venizelos" and "Down
with the allies" were heard. A Greek
politician, a supporter of Venizelos,
was recognized by several in the crowd
and badly beaten without interference
by the police.
Cheer TTnited States.
Shortly afterward French marines
landed at Piraeus on reports that riots
were threatening reached the capital
and took possession of the municipal
theater. A great crowd, formed partly
of Greek reservists, swarmed about
the marines and shouted insulting re
marks. The French got their ma
chine guns ready for action, but to
avoid trouble, withdrew inside the the
ater.
Greek troops appeared and drove
the crowds back, establishing a cordon
about the square. The crowd then
split into several sections. One band
demonstrated before the British lega
tion, where a man who shouted "Down
with England," was arrested by the
legation guards.
Another crowd obtained an Ameri
can flag and carrying this at the head
of the procession, marched to the
American legation cheering the United
States. The American minister was at
the Athenian club, but the demonstra
tors left behind a communication call
ing upon him to protest in the name
of the United tSates against the re
cent steps taken by the allies. This
was signed by a deputation of Gounar
i?t reservists. They were informed
today that the communication would
be transmitted to Washington.

NAPHTHA RUNS VESSEL
New Type of Italian Rattlcship Is
Proven a Success.
Rome, Oct. IS. Correspondents
with the Italian navy have just been
permitted to describe vaguely a new
type of ship, only recently launched,
which may effect a revolution in
naval warfare. The speed of the new
vessel is double that of the swiftest
dreadnaught afloat. The correspond
ents pay the ship is equipped with a
very long turbine, propelled by 25 000
horsepower and burns naphtha as
fuel. So successful have been the ex
periments with the first ship of the
type that Italy is now engaged in the
construction of three more.

TO ANNUL MARRIAGE
French Duke Petitions Church to
Sever Bonds With Austrian Wife.
Paris, Oct. 18. The Duke of Orleans
is about to apply to the court of Rome
for the annullment of his marriage to
the Archduchesse Marie Dorothea of
Austria, according to the Figaro. The
duke contends that the marriage was
not concluded on the Austrian side in
accordance with all the requirements
of ecclesiastical law.
The Duchess of Orleans won a suit
for separation in January, 1914. It
was reported that she charged the
duke with neglect owing to the fact
that she was childless. At the out
break of the war the duke In send
ing back the insignia of the golden
fleece to the Austrian emperor wrote
that his marriage had been the curse
of his life.
RAZOR AND PISTOL
Landlady Battles With Roomer Who
Cut Her Throat.
Dallas, Texas, Oct. 18. Mrs. Minnie
Edrington, her throat cut by a razor
in the hands of A. D. Cannon, wrested
herself free from her assailant early
today and seizing a revolver with
which he was also armed, chased him
from the house. He was arrested.
Mrs. Edrington is in a critical condi
tion. Cannon, a roomer, invaded Mrs. Ed
rington' s bedroom. Three shots fired
by her as she chased him down a
backstairs aroused the neighbors. The
police were called and Cannon, dress
ed in a night shirt, was arrested a
block away. Mrs. Edrington would
make no statement.

Men Who Make Money on

TESTIFY BEFORE STATE BODY
Representatives as Witnesses
Before Utilities Commission.
Fight for Higher Demurrage
Charges Has Been Requested.
Gambling of grain men, tie up of
traffic in the east and the smallness
of demurrage charges are responsible
for the shortage of freight cars in
Kansas, according to testimony pre
sented to the public utilities commis
sion this morning. The only testi
mony presented at the morning session
of the car shortage hearing, came
from C. B. Strohm of Chicago, super
intendent of transportation for the
Santa Fe.
A long, stormy hearing is promised.
The utilities court room was filled
and standing room was at a premium.
Representatives of grain dealers, rail
roads, produce men, commission men,
grocerymen and all classes of business
men who ship goods were gathered
before the commission from all parts
of the state. i
Want Increase in' Rates.
Only one method of relief was sug
gested by the railroad man. He pr
posed that the demurrage rates on
cars, standing on tracks more than
two days, the free time allowed, be
increased. The amount of the in
crease was not stipulated but it is
generally understood that the rail
roads desire that demurrage charges
be increased from $1 a day a day to
5 a day
Further it was suggested that the
public utilities commission take the
matter before the interstate com
merce commission and that a fight for
permanent increase in demurrage
rates thruout the courty be inaugu
rated. Present Rates a Joke. ,
Statements" -were made that with the
price of grain increasing from 1 to
Xhi. cents a bushed dally, the present
demurrage charges were laughed at
by grain gamblers. It was declared
that they were only too glad to meet
the demurrage in order to use the
freight cars for storage purposes until
the market had reached proportions
to satisfy them financially.
Figures presented by Mr. Strohm
showed that on October 14, there were
17,549 Santa Fe box, or grain cars,
on eastern lines and 13,200 eastern
line cars on the Santa Fe line. The
approximate detention of cars on the
eastern line is three months while the
detention of eastern cars on the Santa
Fe line is much less, according to Mr.
Strohm's estimates. This, because the
class of cars, open for the most part.
and loaded with piping for the oil
fields are more quickly unloaded.
Hold Cars a Month.
In testifying to local conditions, Mr.
Strohm declared that in many in
stances grain cars had been tied up
at Hutchinson and Wichita for more
than a month and he read figures
showing that a large number of cars
on the side tracks in those cities on
Saturday were subject to demurrage
charges. In Kansas City the number
of cars on the tracks Saturday subject
to demurrage charges was much less.
There a public storage house is avail
able and the railroads have an oppor
tunity to avail themselves of a rule on
the bill of lading permitting them to
dump grain, at the shipper's expense,
into the public warehouse after they
have kept the cars on the track a cer
tain length of time.
Announcement was made that a
representative of the National Demur
rage association was present to testify
to freight car shortages thruout the
country. It was intimated that such
testimony would be of benefit to the
commission if it decides to go before
the interstate commerce commission
and plead for nation-wide relief
against the car shortage. The chair
man of the commission stated that the
commission is dealing with local con
ditions altho it might be possible that
testimony from the representative of
the national association would be
accepted.
COTTON MAKES RECORD
Storm Scare Boosts New Orleans Price
to 19 Cents a Pound.
New Orleans, Oct. 18. The most
sensational advance of the sensational
season in cotton occurred around the
opening of the market today as the
result of the rumor that the tropical
hurricane had struck into the cotton
region near Mobile. Prices were lifted
65 to S9 points, nearly J 4. 50 a bale, on
the strongest months. The July option
went to 19.17 cent a pound, the high
est ever recorded cn the local future
contract boards.
New Tork. Oct. 18. Cotton contin
ued its record making advance at the
opening of the cotton exchange today
with advances ranging from seven to
48 points on first sales. Cotton for
May delivery sold at 13.85 cents a
pound, a gain of 48 points, or more
than $2 cn the bale. October was up
seven at 18.05 and March was up 4o
at 18.73.
Paper Plant Loss $250,000.
Petoskey, Mich., Oct. 18. Estimates
today of the damage done by fire here
late last night at the plant of the
Wheat Paper company, of Elkhart.
Ind., place the loss at $250,000. The
blaze started during a strong gale and
destroyed all of the buildings. Its
origin, has not been determined. One

TAKES U.S. STAND
Norwsfy Declines Allies' Ver
sion on Submarines.
Not Prohibit Passage Thru or
Sojourn in Her Waters.
London, Oct. 18. Reuter's Chris
tiania correspondent says: "Norway
has informed the entente allies that it
does not recognize it as its duty to
prohibit passage thru or sojourn in
Norwegian waters by belligerent sub
marines." The Norwegian note is in
response to the memorandum of the
entente powers to neutrals suggesting
that belligerent submarines should be
excluded from neutral waters.
The Norwegian government declares
it considers it has the right to pro
hibit submarines designed for war
purposes and belonging to belligerents
from passing thru Norwegian terri
torial waters or sojourning in them,
and says it made use of this right in
issuing the royal decree of October 13,
under which belligerent submarines
are forbidden to traverse Norweigian
waters except in cases of emergency,
when they must remain upon the sur
face and fly the national flag. The
decree also provides that mercantile
submarines are to be allowed in Nor
wegian waters only in a surface posi
tion in full daylight and when flying
the national colors.
On the other hand the government
does not find that it is its duty as
against any of the belligerents to pro-
nioit sucn passage or sojourn. Con
cerning commercial submarines the
new Norwegian regulations impose no
prohibition, it is pointed out, as far as
concerns arrival or sojourn of such
submarines under the conditions de
signated in the royal decree. The
Norwegian government says care will
be taken to see that commercial sub
marines which may arrive in Nor
wegian waters really bear the induti-
able character of merchant ships. Un
til experience nas snown what diffi
culties may arise for maintenance of
neutrality in consequence of the use of
commercial submarines, the note con
tinues, the question of issuing special
new regulation lor such vessels cannot
be taken into consideration.
Position Similar to That of TJ. S.
Norway's position in some respects
is similar to that of the United States,
which in replying to the submarine
memorandum of the entente allies said
that in its opinion, "The allied powers
have not set forth any circumstances,
nor is the government of the United
States at present aware of any circum
stances concerning the use of war of
merchant submarines which would
render the existing rules of interna
tional law inapplicable to them."

JOHN'S IRISH UP!
Kedmond Makes Attack on
British Eule in Ireland.
Not Consistent With Principles
Allies Are Fighting For.
London, Oct. 18. The Irish ques
tion was again brought to the fore in
the house of commons today with the
introduction by John Redmond of a
motion criticising the system of gov
ernment of the island. The motion
reads:
"That the system of government at
present maintained in Ireland is not
consistent with the principles where
fore the allies are fighting in Europe,
and i& or has been mainly responsible
for the recently unhappy events and
for the present state of feeling in that
country."
Mr. Redmond gave notice of his in
tention to attack the government. The
Irish leaders have held a number of
conferences with Baron Wimborne,
lord lieutenant of Ireland, but these
probably had more to do with the
suggestion of extension of conscrip
tion to Ireland than with the griev
ances arising from continuance of
martial law and the failure to release
all those arrested during the uprising
in Jreland last spring.
Didn't Talk Conscription.
However, the question of conscrip
tion did not come under Mr. Red
mond's motion. It doubtless will be
discussed tomorrow when the whole
subject of the man power of the em
pire comes under review. John Raw
linson. moved as an amendment to the
Redmond motion the following:
"Having regard for the importance
of the United Kingdom and Ireland,
combining with the rest of the empire
in presenting a united front to tha
enemy, it is not desirable at the pres
ent time to discuss controversial mat
ters of domestic politics."

Broadside of Superdreadnaught Ari
zona's Twelve 14-ln. Ouns.
New York, Oct, 18. The crew of
the new superdreadnaught Arizona,
which takes her place today in the j
battle line of the Atlantic fleet with
her sister ship, the Pennsylvania,
came from the older battleships Kan
sas, New Hampshire and Vermont,
recently transferred to the Atlantic
reserve fleet at Philadelphia. An of
ficer of Arizona pointed out that the
Arizona's twelve lMnch guns throw
6,000 pounds more in a broadside than
was contained in the combined broad
sides of the Kansas, Vermont and New
Hampshire. The Arizona broadside
weighs about ten tons and can be
hurled about twenty miles. The other
three ships combined carried twelve
12-inch guns in their main batteries!
Now a Dreadnaught Fl- et.
"The Arizona is too big and impor
tant to risk a chance with a green
crew," said one of the Arizona's offi
cers. "As the Kansas, New Hamp
shire and Vermont were going into
the reserve where they belong, they
furnished a majority of the men."
The Connecticut, the sole remaining
ship of the pre-dreadnaught type now
in the Atlantic fleet, is destined to go
in the reserve, the Atlantic fleet hav
ing been re-organized insofar as its
first fighting line is concerned into
a dreadnaught fleet.
When the Idaho and Mississippi go
into commission next year there will
be nineteen vessels of the dreadnaught
class in the four active battle divisions
of the fleet.

Attorney Up for Re-Election,
Charged With Wife Slaying.
Most Baffling and Sensational
Case in City's History.
St. Joseph, Oct. 18. Judge Ryan
this afternoon overruled the motion
to quash the indictment against Mc
Danial and soon afterward a recess
until 9:30 a. m. tomorrow was taken.
It will not be known ur.til then
whether the trial is to proceed or be
continued. One or two of the state's
most important witnesses are said to
be ill and Special Prosecutor Lock
wood probably will fight for a con
tinuance. St. Joseph, Mo., Oct. 18. The first
delay in the trial of Oscar D. McDan
iel, prosecuting attorney, charged with
the murder of his wife, resulted when
attorneys for the defense moved to
quash the indictment charging that
the grand Jury acted illegally in ap
pointing Bart M. Lockwood, special
prosecutor. Lockwood asked for a
forty-eight hour continuance to an
swer the motion. Criminal judge
Ryan granted a continuance to 1:30
this afternoon, adjourning court at
10:30 a. m.
McDaniel declared he was ready for ,
trial and had been since the indict
ment was returned.
"I am innocent," he again asserted.
One hundred and sixteen witnesses
have been summoned and were pres
ent. Ninety-one of the 126 veniremen
had been summoned. Of this number
eight were excused, one because he
was past 65, others because of sick
ness in their families.
Veniremen Iodge Summons?
Despite the fact that he was to go
on trial for his life this morning, Mc
Daniel was at Woodbine last night at
a political meeting. The trial will not
interfere with his campaign, his at
torney said. . -;
The sheriff was instructed to try to
summon the. remainder of the , ve
niremen by 1:30 o'clock today. Lock
wood, who went into the trial alone
for the state said he was unable to
say yet whether he will announce him
self ready for trial.
It is reported many persons left
town when they learned their names
were on the venire list.

McDaniel announced himself ready
to face a jury, but almost up until the
moment the case was called it remain
ed uncertain whether or not the state
would consent to open the hearing. !
Bart M. Lockwood, special prose
cutor in charge of the case, said the
success of the sheriff in serving sub
poenas on witnesses would determine
his course. There are several score
of these, including society women and
business men, telephone girls, politi
cians, physicians and persons in many
other walks of life.
Slain Woman Prominent Socially.
The murder of Mrs. Harriet Moss
McDaniel. the daughter of a fam
ily socially prominent, was one of the
most notable crimes that has occurred
in Missouri for many years. Baffling
to the police and detectives, fraught
with numerous clews, but none of
which pointed strongly to the murder
er, and stirring St. Joseph as it sel
dom has been, the case reached its
climax when Oscar D. McDaniel, the
dead woman's husband, went to trial
in the criminal court here today under
a grand jury indictment that charged
him with the killing. i
Mrs. McDaniel was attacked and
beaten as she lay asleep in her home
here the night of Friday, July 14. She
died in a hospital a few hours after
wards without having regained con
sciousness. Two of her three children
one 5 years old and the other 8
were asleep in a room adjoining their
mother's but were undisturbed.
History of Murder.
Prosecutor McDaniel had been call
ed away from home on a fake tele
phone call
purporting to come from
his brother in an uptown saloon, ac- to arrive at a successful standardiza
cording to the accused man's version ' iton test and warned state legislative
of the murder. As he returned, he , bodies to go slowly in settling tests
was met by one or more of the sup-j when the proposed laws cannot receive
posed murderers and, in the darkness
outside of his home, engaged in a re
volver duel with them.
The deed at once was placed at the
door of men who had been prosecuted
by McDaniel and who had sworn ven
geance against him in numerous let
ters received by him shortly before

INVASION HALTED
Rumanians Put Spike in
ranee of Teutons.
Ad-
Heavy German Assault
Somme Meets Bepulse.
on
London, Oct. 18. Official an
nouncements today from the entente
side report an effective stand by the
Rumanians against General von Fal- j
kenhayn's armies along the Transyl
vania border and 'the sanguinary re-j
pulse by the French of heavy German
assaults on the new French position
in Sailly-Saillisel on the Somme front.
The approach of the cold season is
accompanied by r.o diminution in ac
tivity in most of the European battle
areas. In some of them, indeed, the
efforts of the belligerents apparently
are being redoubled. This seems no
tably true along the eastern front
from Volhynia to Rumania whence
continuous fighting is reported with a
virtual deadlock the result so far.
Further south the attempt of the cen
tral powers to drive a wedge between
the Russians and Rumanians near
Dorna and Watra In the southern
Carpathians, is in an uncertain stage.
Berlin has reported the capture of
some heights, but Petrograd claims
the repulse of all the Teutonic attacks.
Tide of Battle Changes.
Temporarily at least the tide of bat
tle apparently has cha'nged along the
Transylvania border. Berlin has con
ceded the stiffening of the Rumanian
resistance along this front and Bu
charest advices today declare that
King Ferdinand's troops are making
a successful stand and at one point
at least in the predial region south of
Kronstadt are pushing General von
Falkenhayn's armies back.
From the Rumanian viewpoint all
the military news is reassuring, it is
declared. Russian troops in force are
reported., helping the Rumanians to
defend the passes from Transylvania
into their territory.
On the Somme front German ' at
tacks were delivered against the
French line both north and south of
the Somme. Three assaults by the
Germans upon the. French in Sailly
Saillisel are declared by Paris to have
been repulsed with heavy losses to the
Germans, who also were repelled after
they had gained a footing in a French
first line near Berny-En-Santerre,
south of the river.
On the British front in the Somme
region progress by General Haig's
forces between the Albert-Bapaume
road and Lesboeuf is reported despite
tne prevalence of rainy weather.
