pointment never comes to the

they havo to obtain results;
The calves raised by the Lee
County Club members wore con
sidered good enough to be plac?
ed ahead of calves from other
counties and when wo consider
tin? $225 won by the Leo Coun?
ty boys and girls against the$25
won by the Tazewell County
Club it is more pleasant than
mir predictions authorized

cannot be extended the manage

Editor Post:?
1 noticed your paper pub?
lished Wednesday October Ith,
made mention of the Motor?
cycle race at Wise, and gave
the machine 1 rode as a racing
machine.
1 wish to say in this connec?
tion that the machine I rode
was a strictly slock motor, 1014
model with 191-1 clttch and car
buretor; the fork also was 1914
strictly stock, having had the
springs removed from it, the
tire, lank and frame wero the
racing type. 1 wish for your
readers to not be mislead along
this line, ns 1 was not riding a
racing motorcycle, but merely
part of a racing frame. The
engine has been in use here in
the County for over two years
und is now in our shop, and I
would be pleased to show it to
anyone and convince them it is
the same as all the 191-1 twin
motors put out by the Hendee
Manufacturing Company dur?
ing 1914 and 1915. There are a
great many boys, 1 think, that
do not know the dilTeronce in
a racing machine and a draft
horse.
You may publish any part of
this letter you desire in your
next issue Thanking you, 1 am
Yours very truly,
S. O. Thomas.

WOULD DEFRAUD BY
RURAL CREDIT ACT
Many Fake Organizations
Throughout Country
Fleece Farmers.
Washington, D. U., Oct. l'J.?
Seeking to head oil" what thoy
believe in developing Into one
of ihn greatest financial frauds
the United States has known,
the federal farm loan board to?
day asked Hui aid of the depart?
ment of justice. Clear across
the continent,in a strip of states
from Virginia to California, tho
hoard reported to tho justice
department, organizations, ei?
ther deliberately fraudulent or
at heut illegal, have sprung up
for the purpose of defrauding
farmers through the hitter's
ignorance of the now rural
credits act. In oho single in?
stance, it is Haid, the farmers
have been victimized to an ag?
gregate of $350,000.
Governors of states and mem?
bers of congress have been
uiadu unwilling parties to a
few of these illegal operations,
it in said, the promoters taking
advantage of them, as well as
of the farmers. Prominent men
in all walks of life have been
involved, their names being us?
ed in some cases .-imply to lend
respectability. The hoard be?
lieves it will be ahle to prose?
cute successfully. A short time
ago it. announced a ruling that
no proposed joint stock hind
bank will be chartered if it has
spent money for promotion.
This was designed to hold the
expense of operation down to a
minimum iu order that thu in?
terest rateB to f?rmere may be
tho lowest possible.
In the face of this ruling, it
is said, promoters have con?
tinued to sell stock in the pro?
posed land bunks and to take
parts of the proceeds for their
own services. One of these con?
cern failetl before it could have
oven applietl for a charter, but
it had sold stock to thu amount
of several hundred thousand
dollars to farmers- In many
cases the stock bud been sold
with the understanding that
the company is to apply for a
chartor under tho now Federal
law, vjhon there has been no
such intention on tho part of
tho promoters. The board to?
day would not make public the
names of the concerns to which
lit is calling tho justico depart?
ments^ attention, and refuse to
give their locations, save that
by coincidence they have ap?
peared in tho belt of Btatoa
across the middle of tho coun?
try, comprising some of tho
most prosperous farming sec?
tions.

Virginia Coal Products Cor?
poration Capitalized at
$1,500,000.
Norton, Oct. 12.?Papers of
incorporation have been (ileil
and a charter issued by the
State Corporation Commission
to the Virginia Coal Product
Corporation, of Tncoma, Va.,
with a capital of $1,000,000.
It is understood that this new
corporation has acquired by
purchase the properties of tho
Fork Kidge Coal Company,
linost Mountain Coal ami Coke
Company, and M. .1. Mills, ag?
gregating about four thousand
acres of lino coal land. As
soon as machinery and material
can be acquired, the corpora?
tion will start the errection of a
modern by-product coking plant
that will cover about nine acres
of land at the present mine Of
the Pork Kidge Coal and Coke
Company. An expenditure of
about $3,000,000 is contemplat?
ed.
'The promotion of this enter?
prise is duo to the efforts of
Dr. \V. .1. SproleB, of Ashevillo,
N. O, who tor the past two
years has spent most of his
time studying the by-product
industry and examining the
coals in Virginia,West Virginia
and Pennsylvania, Dr. Bprolos
has found the coal in this sec?
tion to be superior for by-pro?
duct purposes;.
It is expected that Dr. Sprplcs
will be identified with the new
corporation in an oflicilal capo,
city.
While TuCOina will receive
the greatest direct benefits from
this immense enterprise, the
business will be so extensive as
to be felt throughout this sec?
tion, especially in Norton and
Coeburu, which are only about
live miles from 'I'acoma.
