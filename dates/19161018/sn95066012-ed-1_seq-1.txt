President Elliott Appeals to Public
Service Commission
MUST HAVE LARGER INCOME
Eight-Hour Law Will Add $2,000,000
to Operating Expenses of
' , Company.
Boston, Oct. 17. An appeal for in
creased passenger and freight rates
for the New York, New Haven & Hart
ford Railroad Company was made by
President Howard Elliott before the
State Public Service Commission
today.
"It is a sum in simple arithmetic,"
Mr. Elliott said, "that the New Haven
cannot pay out millions more each
year for labor and materials and have
an adequate amount for betterments
and improvements while the revenue
remains stationary."
Mr. Elliott suggested that local pas
senger fares be increased to 2 8-4
cents a mile and the mileage rate be
increased to 2 1-2 cents from 2 1-4
cents.
President Elliott informs stockhold
ers in his statement that the eight
hour law will cause an increase of ex
penses of $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 a
year, depending on the way the
statute Is Interested.

POLISH RELIEF FAILS
President Wilson Unable to Secure
Co-operation of Belligerents.
Long Branch, N. J., OcL 17.
President Wilson announced today
men ma vuuris lu ui llis uuuui an tijsicn j
ment among belligerent nations to al
low relief supplies to be sent to In
land had failed.
The President gave out a statment
saying he had received replies from
the rulers of Great Britain, France,
Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary
to a letter he sent in July, sug
gesting that those nations combine to
assist in Polish relief work.
The statement says:
"I have now received replies from
the King of England, the President of

Emperor of Germany, and the Ernper
or of Austria, to my letter of July 20,
1916, in which I tendered the offices of
this Government in negotiations look
ing to a fresh consideration of the
possibility and method of relieving
Poland. It appears, 1 greatly regret
to say, that there are still important
differences between the Allied and
Central Powers as to the terms under
which relief supplies may be sent to
Poland. I am disappointed that I have
not yet been successful in induring
the powers to conclude a definite set
tlement." CLASSIFIED

TO REGAIN LOST
Counterattacks in Somme Region
Repulsed with Heavy Losses
FRENCH MARINES IN ATHENS
King Constantino Urges His Naval
Officers to Remain Loyal to
Greece.
London Oct. 17. Unusual artillery
activity by both sides marked the
day's operations on the Somme front.
The British guns also shelled the Ger
man lines north of Arras and near
Ypres.
The only infantry fighting took
place on the French front. South of
the Somme the Germans have been
making great efforts to regain the
ground recently lost and three coun
terattacks were made in the last
twenty-four hours in the neighborhood
of Veriiy and Belloy, on the Santerre
plateau. All three were repulsed, the
French War OIHce says tonight, with
heavy losses.
North of the Somme the French
captured another portion of the vil
lage of Sailly-Sarllisel and repulsed a
strong counterattack which succeeded
at first In penetrating their front
lines.
With the occupation of Athens and
Piraeus by marines from the warships
of the entente powers, a tense situa
tion has arisen in Athens. Great
crowds of royalists have paraded the
streets of the Greek capital, cheering
the king and cordons of Greek troops
and marines have been thrown about
the railway stations, city hall and oth
er points occupied by the entente
forces to prevent clashes between
them and the royalists.
An unofficial dispatch says
Admiral Dufournet was hissed by the
throngs In the streets of Athens and
that a detachment of French sailors
was driven back by the hostile crowd.
King Constantine, In a speech to the
officers of his fleet, told them he
would stand by them, no matter
what consequences might follow their
loyalty to Greece.
Volhynla, Galicia and Transylvania
are still tho points where the heaviest
fighting is taking place. Along the
Somme front in France, bombard
ments alone have prevailed, except to
the east of Belloy-en-Santerre, where
tthe Germans threw two attacks
against the French, only to be re
pulsed. In Macedonia, the hostilities
have been confined mainly to patrol
engagements and artillery duels. Bad
weather has set in throughout the
Austro-Ualian theater, and with snow
in the mountains and rain in the val
leys, little fighting of moment has tak
en place.
Continuing their violent offen
sive in Galicia, tho Austro-Germans,
according to both Berlin and Vienna,
have taken trenches over a front of
1 14 miles from the Russians and
made prisoner 30 officers and 190
men. West of Lutsk, in Volhynla.
the Russians attacked violently many
time?, but, according to Vienna, were
everywhere repulsed with greut
losses. In tho southern Carpathians,
near Dorna Watra, additional bights
have been taken from the Russians
by the Teutonic allies.
In Transylvania. the Rumanians
fighting near the border passes con
tinue to hold back the Austro-Germans
almost everywhere. In the Uzul val
ley they have driven the Invaders back
across the Rumanian border.
"Honing" For Vermont
There's just one thing I really want,
And that's to get back to old Vermont;
Away from the hustle, the tussle and
push.
And revel again in tho old sugar bush.
I want to see the dear old folks,
And hear again all their Yankee Jokes,
I want to see the Green Mountains
again.
And stroll on the shore of blue Cham
plain. I've wandered in the desert in its
glare of burning sand,
The wanderlust has led mo to the
banks of the Rio Grande.
If I could beg or borrow the right
amount of dough,
I'd chuck the game tomorrow and to
Old Vermont I'd go.
Oh a ticket for St. Albans, Barnet or
Hurlington,
Just put me off at Rutland, Newport,
or Bennington;
Oh to flirt once more in Rockingham,
or in Montpelier's whirl.
Or to hold the hand of a Lyndon maid
or a Brattlehoro girl.

FACTORY FIRE
Two More Employes Believed tO
Have Perished
BLAZE STARTED BY CHEMICALS
Nine Office Workers Trapped in
Room Only 16 Feet from the
Ground.
New York, Oct. 18. Seven persons
were burned to death and two others,
who are missing are ieared to have
lost their lives in a fire late yesterday
with a material loss estimated at
$250,000. Tho charred bodies were
not found until the flames had been
extinguished and llreinen were injur
ing water into the ruins of the build
ings. Search was being made laat
night for the two who are still miss
ing, but it is believed they perished.
All those burned were employed in the
plant of the Oakes dye manufacturing
company where the flames started.
The first started among chemicals
on the first floor of the Oakes build
ing and spread with such rapidity
that the office force was trapped on
the second floor.
Tho police have learned that an elec
trlcian at work on the first floor of
the dye-making plant making repairs
to the electric light fixtures dropped
a ladder on it jar containing chemi
cals which burst in flames.
There were six young wdmen and
the three men on the necond floor
when the tire began. Not one of them
has been seen since.
A half dozen windows were lo
cated close to where the young wom
en were at work and it would have
been a drop of only It! feet to the
street. The authorities believe tho
employes were suffex'ated by chemical
fumes and were unable to attempt es
cape.
THE HUTCHVILLE TRAIL
New Route to Top of Mount Manfield
Open to Climbers
Robert M. Ross of the state forestry
department has returned from Mt.
Mansfield, where he has been complet- I
ing a trail up tho mountain for the use
of the fire patrol, which, however, is
open to the public as well. This trail, I
which will be known as tho Hutch
ville trail, starts at Ilutclivllle, four
milts lrom Underhill Center, and pro
ceeds In a northerly direction In tho
state forest to Nebraska Notch, after
which it hits the Long Trail, cut out
by tho remainder of the way to tho
top of the mountain. The trail is an
ledal one and one of the best In Ver
mont. It proceeds through beautiful
section of the count: y, including the
spot where the picturesque waterfall,
known as the 100 Toot lall, is located.
By this routo it is about eight miles
from Mutchville to the top of the
mountain, the part of the trail just
completed by Mr. Ross being about
five miles in length. This trail is a
very easy one, and is marked by prom
inent red blazes.
The trail known as the Stevensvillo
trail, which was slatted last year and
has Just been completed, runs from
Stevensville to the Ixmg Trail, run
ning into the latter just south of the
point known as the Needle's Eye. This
trail is also marked by red blazes,
which are placed sufficiently high as to
be seen above the snow In winter. To
hikers from this city this trail Is pro
bably the best, being shorter than the
Mutchville trail.
As stated above, while the trails
were built primarily for the use of the
lire patrolmen, they are open to tho 1
public as well. A telephone has been
installed in the ranger's cabin at
Hutchville, which will afford easy com
munication in ease of a fire.
STATE MAY BUY
Has Option of Tract of Forest Land
near Camel's Hump
State Forester A. F. Hawes and 11.
A. Chandler have just returned from
Huntington, where they have been
looking over a tract of land about 2.
300 acres In extent, adjoining the state
forest on Camel's Mump. Mr. Hawes
has secured an option on the tract and
has recommended to Governor Gates
thut the state purchase the same.
There is much valuable timber, con
sisting principally of spruce and birch,
on tho land, practically none of which
has been burned over, which would
soon be cut off if the state did not
make tho purchase, so for this reason
it is desirable to buy the tract now.
If this is done, it would make tho .total
area of the Camel's Hump state forest
over 3,500 acres. It Is also of consid
erable importance to protect the two
or three streams which have their
source on this tract. The tract is near
some of the property left by Colonel
Battell to 'Middlebury college. Mr.
Haves stated to a Fre Press reporter
yesterday that the price asked for the ;
land Is very reasonable.
CATHOLIC' MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
To Be Erected at Burlington in Honor
of Bishop le Goesbriand '
A hospital will be erected at the
south west corner of Pearl and Pros
pect street by Catholics of the diocese
of llurlingon, in memory of the late
Rt. Rev. Bishop lie' Goesbriand. An
nouncement of this was made in
every church in the diocese on Sun
day, by means of a pastoral letter
from Rt. Rev. Brstrop J. J. Rice.
The cost of the building and when
It will be constructed depends largely
upon when the funds are raised.
This year is the 100th anniversary
of the birth of the reverend Bishop
The land upon which the new hospital
will stand was purchased by Bishop
DeGcesbriand during ills lifetime and
given to the diocese. The site years
ago contained an orphanage and
later St. Joseph's college which was
torn down 1(5 years ago.
A meeting of all those Interested
will take place in the Cathedral Wed
nesday evening. I
Bishop Rice's letter, in its entirety,
is as follows:
Cathedral of the Immaculate Con
ception,
Burlington, Vt, Oct. 10, 1916.
Rev. Dear Father: .
The present year marks the 100th
anniversary of tho birth of the late
Bishop De Goesbriand of sarjrtly mum
ory.
For 46 years Bishop le Goesbriand
went about the State of Wimnnt iln-
I Ing good, and every . portion of this
vast diocese felt the uplifting In
fluence of his pastoral care.
Practically every advantage that
we, as catholics, enjoy today, is the
result of his wise planning and zeal
ous encouragement, tind not a few of
our, churches, schools and institutions
owe their existence, or at least re
ceived substantial aid through his ard-
ous In soliciting funds in other dio-
ct ses.
Vermont is deeply indebted to the
noble Breton called by Divine Provi
dence to shape the destinies of the See
of Burlington.
It has frequently been our happy pri
vilege to hear from the lips of both
non catholics and catholics, expres
sions of profound reverence and abid
ing gratitude inseparably linked with
the name of Bishop DeGoesbriand. It
has therefore occurred to us that the
present anniversary should not be al
lowed to puss unnoticed by the re
cipients of his benefactions; a suitable
memorial bearing the honored name of
Bishop DeGueghrtand should evidence
to posterity the esteem, love and gra
titude in which we hold the pioneer
bishop of Vermont.
But a mere monument, incapable of
lending itself to' the service of man
kind, would ill become the memory of
one whose life radiated service to suf
fering humanity. A memorial to wt
petuate the memory ol Itishop DeGoes
briand, should be something more than
a mere monument of artistic merit
and it should embody what was near
est and dearest to his priestly heart,
unselflish devoted service to his fel
low men.
The one institution which would en
list the active sympathy of all loyal
Vermonters, and at the same time
serve as a perpetual memorial of a
grateful state to a noble benefactor. Is
a hospital.
It seems providential that the good
bishop during his lifetime purchased
out of the funds which came to him
through his family inheritance, a beaut
if ul plot of ground directly opposite
the University of Vermont medical
Bchool. Where could a more advan
tageous site for a hospital be found!
And this superb site was purchased
and donated to us by him whose mem
ory we wish to enshrine; no wit be
hooves us to continue the good work
and erect a suitable memorial where
ailing humanity may continue to bless
the memory of one of Vermont's great
est benefactors.
As the proposed memorial is to be a
work which will benefit Catholics and
non-catholics alike, we earnestly be
feech you to consult with the leading
catholic and non-catholic friends of
Bishop DeGoesbriand, living within
the limits of your parish, in order to
be ablo to from an estimate of the
amount of money (in cash, or pledges
payable within a year) which we may
expect as a contribution from your
parish to the Bishop DeGoesbriand
Memorial hospital. Of course this es
timate will not be considered as in any
way binding you to furnish the amount
of money stated: it is simply a state
ment of the amount you judge your
parish capable of furnishing.
Pleaso fill out. the enclosed blank
and return same to the Rt. Rev. Bish
op at the conference.
Devotedly your In Domino.
Joseph J. Rice.
Bishop of Burlington.

FOR FLETCHER'S
C ASTO R I A
TO BRATTLEBORO
AND RETURN
With Lever Chained and Locked
Into High Gear "
WAS REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT
Over Green Mountain Range and Hog
back Twice Without Shift of
Gears.
A Hudson Super-Six driven by Farl
W. Williams, owner of the Bennington
garage arrived from Brattleboro early
Tuesday evening after making the trip
from Bennirrgton to Brattleboro and
return with the shift lever chained
into high gear.
Just before the start a paddock was
bought at the Adams Hardware store
and a short sited chain was passed
around the lever and socket frame and
publicly locked so that it could not be
moved. The keys were then left with
W. C. Firth at his shop and Mr. Wil
liams started lor Brattleboro ac
companied by F. K. Howe of the Ban
ne.1. They left at 12 o'clock Monday and
reached Wilmington in 55 minutes
without stopping the car though Mr.
Williams was forced Into the ditch by
a big limousine on the steepest part
of the road above the Dunville forks.
A stop of an hour was made at Wil
mington for dinner.
Beyond Wilmington there are ex
tensive road repairs in progress. Two
temporary bridges have to be crossed
aud in ono place a Tllford foundation
is being built of Held stone right
across the full width of the road.
This new work added to the stiff
grade of Hogback made the trip to
Brattleboro from Wilmington difficult
but Mr. Williams made the distance
in 48 minutes with one stop on t!?e
down slope of Hogback: to wait for a
dumpcart to get out of the road.
With the machine chained and
locked Into high gear it was of course
impossible to reverse or turn around
as under ordinary circumstances and
if the car stopped on a hill it would be
necessary to back down by gravity un
til a grade was reached where the car
could he started again on high gear.
The Super-Six reached Brattleboro
in one hour anil 43 minutes actual run
ning time. While in Brattleboro Mr.
Williams with John Munley and . h.
Haskell, two Brattleboro passengers
drove the car up Union hill which is
considered the worst climb in Brat
tleboro. He also drove the car at the
ate ol 05 miles per hour on the Put
ney road and at less than two miles
per hour on the streets of Brattle
boro.
Mr. Williams and Mr. Howe re
mained in Brattleboro over night and
started for Bennington Tuesday morn
ing. The Hudson worked perfectly
and with one pause they reached Wil
mington in 50 minutes.
During the morning there had becA
a hard shower and on reaching Sears
burg mountain they found the surface
of the road very elippery and partly
covered with wet loaves. At the same
time there was a 70-mile gule sweep
ing down into their faces and retard
ing the car. With these drawbacks
they dhl not reach the top of
the mountain but failed by less
than 100 yards. After three trials
they returned to Wilmington and
waited for wind to slow down and the
mud to dry np.
At 4.45 they made another start and
Mr. Wllllums succeeded with com
parative ease in driving the Super-Six
over the mountain and they reached
Bennington at C.10. On the success
ful attempt Mr. W;' lams had a speed
of better than 15 miles per hour reach
ing the top of the grade.
It was undoubtedly the most re
markable automobile exploit ever ac
complished in New Kngland and one
of the most unusual In the history of
nutomohiling. All the auto owners of
this section know tho double moun
tain pans over the Green mountains
and the Hogback between Bennington
and Brattleboro. The elevation of the
high points of tho roadvy In Wood
ford and Searsburg Is about 2350 feet
while Hogback is nearly 2200. The
road is largely narrow and winding
ind rough in many places.
With the car locked into high gear
it was necessary to keep going or back
out and only a perfect car with al
most unlimited power would stand a
show of making the trip under the
conditions imposed.
The mountains and the road are
still there and thine Is an opportunity
for other ambitious car owners to
tost out their favorites if they have
the courage to make the trial.
The Hudson Super-Six can run from
Bennington to Brattleboro and return
on high gear locked there and tho
keys left in Bennington. It is the on
ly car that bus ever done this or tho
equal of this in this part of the coun
try. . I

Yoang Woman's Leg Broken at
Pike's Crossing Underpass
CAR RUNNING AT SLOW SPEED
Accident Reported to Be Due to1
Wind Which Muffled Warning of
Auto Horn.
Miss Lottie Rice, who lives with her
mother, Mrs. Hattie Rice on the Har
wood hill road, suffered a broken leg
and other injuries shortly afcer noon
yesterday when struck by an autorno
xnlle a short distance from her home.
She was at once taken Into the car
which figured in the accident and car
ried to her home. A telephone call
summoned Dv. c-. Uardlnier who set
the broken bone, put the young wo
man in his car and carried her to the
Samaritan hospital in Troy. An X-ray
photograph of tiie broken limb was la
ter made to ascertain the exact ex
tent of the fracture.
The car, a Dodge roadster, owned
and driven by L. V. Crocker of Chest
er with one man passenger, was on its
way to this village. According to the
statements of the occupants the car
jih not running at a rate of speet
higher than 15 miles an hour. The
horn was sounded for the underpass
at the Pike crossing of the Rutland
railroad but because of the heavy wind
that prevailed yesterday the signal
did not reach Miss Rice who was on
way to the Harmon corner to take a
trolley car lor Bennington.
Miss Rice was directly under the
railroad track when she was hit by the
car. L'nware of the presence of the
automobile It la reported that she at
tempted to cross the; highway and Mr.
Crocker was unable to avoid the acci
dent. Stopping the car immediately, the
two men picked up the injured woman
and carried her to her home, the sec
ond house north of the underpass. Dr.
Gardinier found that she had sustained
a fracture of the right thigh a bruised
ankle, an abrascd forehead and other
bruises.
The Injured woman was accompan
ied to the hospital by her brother,
K. Wheeler Rice. At the institution
sho was later reported to be resting
as comfortably as could be expected
under circumstances and that there
was every indication that she had
suffered no permanent Injuries.
