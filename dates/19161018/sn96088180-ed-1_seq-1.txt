HOT ACCEPTED BY
UNITED STATES

German memorandum to tbl govern
ment, proposing certain terms for
tha settlement of tbe Lutltania sink
ing, hat not been accepted by the
United State, Acting Secretary of
State Polk formally announced to
day.
Polk made thl announcement be
cause of published report that tbe
memorandum had been accepted and
would be used tt a basis for a final
settlement These reports stated that
Germany reiterated her contention
that the torpedoing of the Latittnia
yat Justifiable, hot admitted the lott
of American Uvea wts unjutiltable
and expressed regret and promised
financial reparation.
"The note ha not been accepted,"
said Polk, "and It will not be made
public. Stories that It hat been ac
cepted tnd wonld be published were
printed for ptrtitta pnrpotet. The
state department it not going to be
drtwa into t discussion tt Milt time."
It was plainly stated tt tbe depart
ment that officials considered the pub-'
llcttlon of the story today as a poli
tical move to embarrass the depart
ment in the conduct "of Its foreign
affairs. In addition, it was also made
clear that the department believes
foreign Influences also 'were seeking
to take advantage of the political situ
ation in hringtng up the Issue at this
time."
? Although no omdal would say de
finitely when tbe Losltanla case
would be tattled,' Indications were
the question would not be concluded
until after the election. '
Polk'e view. It wss pointed out, It
similar to that of Secretary Leasing

affairs should not he mixed with
politics. Tbe general view has been
that there is very little difficulty
ahead for actual settlement Polk
refused to be specific as to the con
tents of the memorandum.
Tbe published story referred to de
clared that the United States htd
waived Its demtndt for a disavowal
of the 'Lusltanla torpedoing. - Tbe
article continue that an tgreement

ognise that the Losltanla linking waa
Justified, thoagh the lota of American
Uvea vat not Justified. ' Germany, the
article asserted, would express regret
