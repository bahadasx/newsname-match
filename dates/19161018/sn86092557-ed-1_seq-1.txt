Progressive Leader anc
Friend of Roosevelt
1 Writes Hot Letter.
fSpecial Dispatch to Wc?t Virginian)
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.?The Progres
slves of the country are supportim
Hughes and not Wilson, for the presl
? I dency, because they are for real ac
complishments. not fine phrases. Si
says George W. Perkins, chairman o
the Executive committee of the Pro
9 grcssive National committee, and closi
friend of Colonel Roosevelt, in an opet
s letter to President Wilson made pub
} lie here today.
"When the good name and welfari
j* of a people are at stake," wrote Mr
J Perkins, "everything else must be pui
1 aside." The letter in full follows:
* "The morning papers again recort
' the pouring out at Shadow Lawn yes
terday of abuse of those of us wh<
^ for several years have been flghtlni
: for real, not make-believe, progress It
this country
j "The audacity of some of the state
mente made yesterday Is past belief
. Those of us who have been fighting it
p this progressive movement for severs
5 years cannot be satisfied with beau
j tifully, round phrases or with the pass
. age of a new law every fifteen minutes
I which is so worded that it becomei
. Impotent fifteen minutes after It it
. passed. The Wilson laws, from be
ginning to end. are largely patterned
1 after your famous "Seven Sisters'
j laws in New Jersey, which you passed
i under the whip one day. At that time
? you assured the people that thos lawt
w were the cure all for the trust prob
1 lcra, but you know, and every othei
r man In the country at all familiar will
- the situation knows that those law:
i have not change the corporation ques
- tlon one lota Those laws have noi
been worth the paper they were writ
ten on. and the same la the case wltt
most of the laws with htgh-eoundln|
titles passed during your presidents
term
I "For instance, you have referred of
L ten to your great accomplishment If
passing the Clayton bill and > b<
numerous benefits the country Wb re
- ceived therefrom; yet Seator Reed
of Missouri, one of your staunch sup
porters and a Democratic member ol
a half dozen or more senatorial com
mlttees, in speaking of this bill a:
I it was about to be passed, said: "Whet

, anaemic appearance It is a sort o
j* legislative aplogy to tho trusts, de
' llvered hat in hand, accompanied h;
h assurances and no discourtesy (g in

' "This Is an absolutely accurate dc
* scription of the Clayton bill by oni
' of your own associates and can, wltt
equal truth, be applied to most of youi
, other legislation. We Progressives
who are supporting Mr. Hugres art
supporting him because, as Govcrnoi

3 and we are opposing you becaust
0 yours do not. We are for fine phrases;
9 we are for real accomplishments. Youi
motto seems to be, a problem post
r poned is a problem solved. The re
suit is that not since this nation waf
founded have our people accumulated
) so many liabilities as they have un
J der your three and onchalf years ol
, mismanagement. You have not set
J tlod definitely, once and for all, t
single great question that has pre
' sented itself. In each and every cast
you have taken one step forward, twe
steps backward, hestftated and thee
k sidestepped. The result is a sltua
1 tlon of the gravest possible concern
t to the welfaro of our country, and wt
Progressives who are opposing you
I are doing it with motives of the high
, est patriotism, without regard to par
j ty affiliations, past, present or fu
ture, for when the good name and wel
fare of a people are at stake, every
1 thing else must be put aside"
) Made It Easy to Understand.
I A grate and dignified 0. D? after
r listening to the recitation of the eatei
cblsin by a class of children, was
asked to make a few remarks to them,
I. whereupon he arose and said: "I dei
sire, my young friends, to express an
i unqualified approbation of this exercise.
I regard the rntechlsm as the
a most admirable epitome of religious
I belief extant." The superintendent
pulled Meeve nnd naked him to explain

of the children He elucidated as fol)
