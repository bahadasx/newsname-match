REPORT. SUBMARINE
OFF NEW ENGLAND
ENTIRE DESTROYER FLOTIlLA
OF ATLANTIC FLEET ON NEU
TRALITY DUTY.
BRITISH CRUISERS ARE NEAR
English War Vessels Lurk Near Am
erican 'Waters-Neutrality Patrol
Searching For Possible Hidden Sup
ply Base or Wireless Station.
Boston.-An unidentified submar
ine off the New England Coast was
reported by the steamship Bovic at a
time when the steamship lane to
Europe was dotted with munition
laden ships just released from the
embargo placed on their movements
after the German submarine raid off
Nantucket.
The reports of the strange sub
marine were coincident with an
nouncements that a fleet of British
cruisers and destroyers was off the
coast and that virtually the entire
available destroyed flotilla of the
Atlantic fleet. of the United States
Navy was on neutrality duty. That
the American destroyers were con
ducting an active investigation of sto
ries of secret submarine bases on this
coast was indicated in a dispatch from
Bar Harbor. Maine, which said the de
stroyer Paulding, sent out from the
Newport naval bsse, made an ex
haustive search of the coast between
Bar Harbor and Rockland. There was
not a cove or rock inlet that escap
ed the sharp scrutiny of the destroy
er's crew. At dusk the Paulding put
back to Rockland and it was under
stood that she had discovered noth
ing suspicious.
Other destroyers known to be off
the coast and believed to be engaged
in much the same work as the Pauld
ing are the McDougal, Fanning and
Warrington.' The McDougal, during
the evening anchored at Eastport, in
proximity to the Canadian border.
The presence of these destroyers in
Eastern Maine waters recalled rumors
that have -nersisted for months that
- Teutonic sympathizers had a hidden
wireless station somewhere in the
vicinity of Bar Harbor and that there
was a suspicion also that they were
establishing a secret submarine base
on the Baine coast. Few places on the
Atlantic shore line of the United
States, shipping men say, offer better
advantages for submarines having de
signs' on allied supply ships. Submer
sibles operating from one of the in
numerable isolated coves on the
Maine coast, it is pointed out, could
threaten both the steamship lane to
Europe and the transport ships.

The king discussed the form wwhich
Greece's proposals to the Entente
with a view of abandoning neutrality
should take and declared his convie
tion that Greece's future depended up
o nher joining the Entente. He ex
pressed a readiness to do so, not de.
manding more than a guarantee of
the integrity of Greece and such ma
terial assistance in equipping the
army as would be essential to render
Greece's participation In the war of
real value to the Allies.
Discussing a telegram from M.
Romanos, the Greek Minister to
France on September 30, reporting a
conversation with Premier Briand,

three compensations which the
French Premier offered informally
did not include a guarantee of integ

ALLIES INSIST ON
SEARCHING MAILS
LATEST REPLY TO AMERICAN
PROTESTS REITERATES CLAIM
TO RIGHT.
U. S. DOES NOT ADMIT THIS
Promise to Remedy Any Faults,
Abuses of Serious Mistakes in Cen
sorship That May Be Brought to
Attention of Allied Governments.
Washington.--In their last reply to
American protests against interfer
ences with neutral mails just made
public, by the State Department, the
Allied governments reiterate their
right to intercept and search all gen
uine mail found on neutral vessels
on the high seas or in allied ports but
they promise to remedy "any faults.
abuses or serious mistakes" in cen
sorship that may be brought to their
attention. They declare unjustified by
facts the American charge that illegal
juridustion has been gained by diver
sion of neutral ships from the high
seas into the territorial waters of the
Allies. The next move of the Ameri
can Government has not been deter
mined.
The note, transmitted jointly by
the British and French governments
was delivered to the State Depart
ment by the embassies several days
ago has just been made public by
agreement of the governments con
cerned. It makes reply to Secretary
Lansing's memorandum of May 24 in
which the United States declared the
Allies had been guilty of "lawless
practices" in their mail censorship
methods and that "only a radical
change, restoring to the - United
States its full rights as a neutral pow
er will satisfy this government."
The Allies maintain they are "sin
cerely endeavoring to avoid any en
croachment on the legitimate exer
cise of the rights of inoffensive neu
tral commerce" and suggest that the
Hague convention uoted in the
American memorandum is not bind
ing because it has not been ratified
by several belligerent powers, though
the allied policy has been guided by
the intention it expresses.
The note is nearly 5,000 words in
length. It argues that the United
States and the Allies agree that the
postal union convention does not ap
ply and that postal packages may be
examined to see if they contain con
traband.
AMERICA ALWAYS READY TO
FIGIT FOR THINGS AMERICAN
Pennsylvania Democrats Hear Presi
dent Wilson at Shadow Lawn.
Long Branch, N. J.-In a speech
before a large delegation of Penn
sylvania Democrats who came here
with bands playing and banners fly
ing, President Wilson declared that
while he is for peace, "America is al
ways ready to fight for things that
are American." He summed up his
idea of the issues of the present cam
paign in these words:
"America knows that it Is faced
with this choice: Peace, the continu
ance of the development of business
along the lines which it has now es
tablished and developed and the
maintenance of well known progres
sive lines of action, on the one hand;
or, on the other ,a disturbance of
policy all along the line, new condi
tions, new adjustments, undefined al
terations of policy and back of it
all invisible government."
VOTE FOR HUGHES DOES NOT
MEAN A VOTE FOR WAR:
Lincoln, Neb. - Charles Evans
Hughes characterized as "preposter
ous" the declaration that a vote
for him meant a vote for war.
"I am a man of peace." Mvr. Hughes
said in a Nebraska speech. "Who
wants war? I don't want war."
Ccrrect policies, Mr. Hughes said.
would keep America out of war.
"That sort of thing we have been
having will not keep us out of war,"
he said. "It will embroil us in diffi
culty."
In the six addresses which marked
the opening day of his presidential
campaign in Nebraska the Republi
can nominee discussed nearly all the
Issues of the campaign. He charac
terized as '"temporary nnd abnormal"
the present prosperity of the country
and urged support of the Republican
party so that a protective tariff might
be enacted to fortify American enter
prise in post bellum days against un
equal competition.
"The country was living," he said,

war and wL ' ' t long have the stim

COMMITTEE TO MAKE PLANS
Great Live Stock Conference at
Orangeburg First of Many to be
Held in State Next Year.
Orangeburg.-The coming of the boll
weevil will not find South Carolina un
prepared. A definite --ogram of pre
paredness by diversification is being
planned and before the conclusion of
the live stock conference here a com
mittee of five South Caroiinaians was
appointed to serve for one year, to
amke plans for the holding of other
similar conferences in the state, pro
mote the live stock industry, diversi
fication of farm crops and kindred sub
jects. This committee consists of: M.
0. Dantzler. Orangeburg: D. C. Hey
ward, Columbia; R. L. Montague. Char
leston; L. I. Guion. Lugoff; N. B. Dial,
Laurens.
The Orangeburg packing house and
the Orangeburg Farmers' Co-operative
creamery were indorsed and the farm
ers were urged at once to begin the
growing of hogs and cattle and the
establishing of dairies. The confer
ence also adopted a resolution in favor
of the complete eradication of the cat
tle tick from the 13 remaining counties
under quarantine in this state at the
earliest possible day and urge' :pon
the people the necessity for full and
active co-operation with the state and
federal authorities having this work in
charge.
The high points of enthusiasm for
the entire conference were aroused by
two addresses. one by Mrs. G. H. Ma
this. representative of the Alabama
State.Bankers' Association, and H. B.
Mobley, president of the Arkansas
Farmers' Union, the largest attend
ance of the entire conference being
the last session. And, while these two
speakers were carrying the conference
by storm, the time between their ad
dresses was taken by experts from the
United States department of agricul
ture. Clemson College, and farmers of
South Carolina in giving the large
audience of representative farmers
beneficial and practical information
upon the ordinary problems affecting
the breeding, feeding and marketing
of their stock
This conference demonstrated that
the farmers o: South Carolina are
earnestly and seriously studying the
live stock situation with a view to
ward ctinging their methods of farm
ing from the crop system to diversi
fied farming.
Mad Dog Bites 12 at Anderson.
Anderson.-Ten of the 12 people
bitten by a mad dog here went to Co
lumbia, where the Pasteur treatmjent
was administered. All of those bit
ten are white people, and range in
age from 20 months to 33 years. The
dog was a French poodle, belonging
to the family of J. B. Quarles, and
was but a few months old. The dog
was killed and the head sent to Co
lumbia for examination. A telegr-aph
c communication was received, indi
cating that the animal was afflicted
with rabies.
Those bitten were: Claudine Bar

and a child of S. E. Kay. The peo
ple are all prominent in Anderson.
Florence Schools Growing.
Florence.-The growth of the Flor
nce schooLs is something appalling to
those who have them to take care of.
[t was thought that when the new
Park school was built there would be
plenty of room and the new teachers1
who had been emp-loyed for this ses
sion were thought to have been a suf
ficient number to take care of the
schools, but the board found that it
would be necessary to employ two
more, one for each school.

"GO-TO-SU NDAY-SCHOOL"D
South Carolina Ascta.:.ation Designate
February 11, 1917, Date For Great
Attendance.
Spartanburg.-At a special meetir
of the central committee of the Soul
Carolina Sunday School Associatio
held in the office in the Chapm
building recently, February 11, 191
was adopted as the state-wide "Go-t
Sunday School Day," for South Car
lina.
"Go-to-Sunday School Day" was c
igniated by the Kentucky. Sunda
School Association a- few years at
as at state-wide interdenomination
movement. Since that time, it h,
been adopted by other state Sund
School associations and some of ti
denominations. The purpose of tl
"Come-to-Sunday School Day"
South Carolina is to get as many pe
ple as posible, not ordinarily in ti
habit of going to Sunday school,
come at least one Sunday; then mal
them welcome on this Sunday, infor
them of the work, provide them wi1
suitable classes and competent teac
ers, and use every effort to enrc
them as 'permanent members of tl
school.
There are now enrolled in t
white Sunday schools of South Car
lina about 209,000 people. If all tl
Sunday schools will join in this e
operative campaign, it is believe
that one-third of a million people w
be in attendance on February 11. A
extensive plan of publicity will beg
in December, 'and all needed supplii
will be in the state Sunday scho
office ready for distribution early
January.
The central committee also tot
steps toward preparing for the ne:
state convention, which is to be he

e
de- Those who hold antiquated Ideas of
1s. the dignity of authorship, who look
ire upon it as a profession, will doubtless
n- repel with horror the Idea of atiliat- nl
the lug the Authors' League of America sl
'he with the American Federation of la- in
as bor, a writer in the Philadelphia
Ledger observes. That would be a kI
confession that authorship is a trade. it
But why not? Tempora mutantur et of
m nos mutamur in illis. Space rates, -w
-from the munificent sums paid to the S,
er Kiplings to the earnings of newspa- B
e per writers, have made the pushers n
of the pen (or typewriter) laborers for a
ing hire. Should not they be unionized of
It like other craftsmen? Shoul& not It
ax they have an effective weapon to four
for 'ish over the heads of editors and pub- a
sal Ushers? We hear much of the earn
ings of the successful novelist or B
ed playwright. He no longer has his ci
is address in Grub street. He rejoices
re in an automobile, a yacht, a country
place. But that is no reason why he
%w- should evade the debt which Bacon
in said every man owed to his ~profes- to
e- soin, or if to modify Franklin's phrase, f
ng should work together lest they starve
1e- separately. It is gratifying to find
im- the great lights of the league willing D
*in- to ally themselves together with Mr.
ies Gompers for the sake of their lesser
nt- brethren. h
In There has always been difficulty in tr
making brains a marketable commod- m
ted Ity. For one thing there has been.
er. no fixed standard of payment. The
cd public taste Is fickle, as becomes the Ia
ee arbiter of the goddess of fortune. The
lu- Inventor of a "best seller" may selz.e
ire- the skirts of happy chance. But how
rk often genius has to be like virtue, Its
Lid, own reward! If there had been ana
ion authors' union In Milton's day hea
Lng would have got more for "Paradise at
Lost" than ?5 down and a conditional
Is promise of ?15 more. To be sure,
L~d. he had various government appoint
his m'ents that kept him from penury.
c- Other English writers have been sim
e ilarly fortunate. But the pensioning a
ad of art and literature has never been h
rh a favorite expedient with democracy. E
e American writers have always had
to depend upon themselves. Do they si
lnot owe It to themselves and to their
efamilies to adjust their lives to a
nhbusiness basis? Should not a man
hsJ who writes a book be as well protect-e
ened as a man who makes a door? Doc
n-tor Johnson, writing "Rasselas" to get
money to bury his mother, knew hewa
et twas:

Toll, envy, want, the patron and the jail.
The distinguished men- of letters
ofwho are engineering this union project
e show a generous concern for the rank
and file. For union wages mean lev-p
reling down as well as leveling up.
When the scale is fixed the employera
bcan neither go over nor go under it.
ab-A novel will cost just so much, no
>-matter who writes It. Between the
-lcarefully polished sonnet and vers t
.Ilibre, as between Trojan and Tyrian, ki
'there will be no discriminnan. Ed- t
r- Itors and publishers ought to jump In
e- at the suggestion. If they can no ai
nelonger screw down the hack writer m
to the limit of his necessities, on the
dother' hand they will not have to bid to
against one another for the services si
of the idol of the moment. Decidedly ti
this unionizing scheme will be a good be
thing all around. The pen pusher
should push It along. Ja
