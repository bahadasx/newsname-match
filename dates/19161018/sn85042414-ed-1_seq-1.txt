Board Trimmed off $27,500,

(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D.,'Oct. 18.—Did the
state board of equalization in making
its recent flat ten per cent reduction
in the valuation of farm lands, rail
ways and town and city lots exceed its
authority
The state tax commission holds that
it did, and to sustain its contention it
cites paragraph five of section 2141
of the compiled laws of 1913, which,
referring to the duties of the state
board of equalization, reads as fol
lows.
"They shall not reduce the ag
gregate valuation of all the prop
erty of the state as returned by
the several county auditors more
than one percentum on the whole
valuation thereof."
Was More Than One Percent.
There is no question that the recent
ten percent cut on three of the state's
most important classes of property did
exceed a reduction of one percent up
on the aggregate value of all the
property of the state as returned by
the several county auditors. The re
duction on farm lands totaled $21,
000,000 on railways, $5,000,000, and
on town and city lots $1,500,000, a
grand total reduction of $27,500,000
on a whole assessed valuation of ap
proximately $354,000,000. If the sta
tute is to be literally enforced, the
tax commission claims that the total
reduction which the board is author
ized to make cannot upon this ap
proximate whole valuation exceed $3,
640,000.
Statute Confusing.
The tax commission has not to date
formally called the attention of the
board of equalization to its ulleged
oversight. Informally, however, the
pending action discussed yesterday
by State Auditor Carl O. Jorgenson,
secretary of the board, Governor Han
na, its chairman, and Commissioner
of Agriculture and Labor Flint. They
state that their action was taken un
der the authority conveyed in subdi
vision four of sectlon.2141 of the com
piled" acta of 1913, immediately pre
ceding subdivision Ave, above quoted.
Subdivision four provides:
'"They shall deduct-from the
aggregate valuation of all the
property of every county in the
state which they believe to be
valued above its true and full
value such percentum as will re
duce the same to its true and full
value in money."
Equalization, Not Reduction.
The board's action at its last meet
ing was along the line of equalization
rathgr than reduction, its members
claim. There was no flat reduction af
fecting all property. The reduction
made in the three classes named,
however, does result in a flat reduc
tion of the assessed valuation of the
entire state, somewhat exceeding sev
en per cent.
Flat Raise is Legal.
The supreme court has held that a
flat increase in the assessed valuation
of the state is legal. Such was its de
cision in a test case brought to de
termine the legality of the 12.5 per
cent raise ordered in 1909, in order to
provide more funds. A similar flat in
crease of twenty per cent was ordered
in 1915, and its legality has not been
questioned. The board of equalization
is inclined to believe that any author
ity given for a flat increase in the
valuation of the state must also extend
to permission for a flat reduction.
No Action as Yet.
The state tax commission had the
matter brought to its attention only
yesterday, and it has not determined
to date on what action will be taken,
if any, by that body. It is entirely
probable that upon the error, if an
error has been made, being formally
brought to the attention of the state
board of equalization, it may be cor
rected without further process- If
legal action is resorted to, it will be
in the form of a petition to the su
preme court for a writ of mandamus.
Would Mean Much Work.
A re-equalization of the valuation
placed on farm lands, railroads and
town and city lots would mean a great
deal of work for the county auditors,
whose returns already have been re
ceived from the state auditor. The
tax commission suggests that some of
the details might be simplified by de
termining the per cent of excess re
duction, if any. and certifying the
same to the county auditors to be
spread pro rata over the several valu
ations affected.

(Herald Special Serviced
Bismarck, N. D., Oct. 18.—More
than 41,000 North. Dakota automobile'
owners are being urged by Secretary
of State Hall to do their Christmas I
shopping for license tags early. Dur
ing the past two years, because of the
possibility of a change in the license
law, automobilists have held off until
April, when the demand for tags has
come in a rush. Last April 10,000
tags were issued, and the force, was
swamped. Eighteen thousand more
applications were received for the
months of May and June.
"Why wait until April or May to
get your tag?" asks the secretary of
state in his circular letter. "The fee
is the same whether you register in
January or in November."
The letter Is accompanied by the
regulation application blank, upon
which the owner is expected to Btate
the make of his car, the model or

which the car is used, and other in

Athens, Oct. 18.—On the initiative

in case of a declaration of war by
Greece or other complications. Per

Three hundred French marines
were transferred from the municipal
theater to Zappelon exposition build

palace. They marched through the
streets, with bayonets Axed and
trumpets blowing, accompanied by
moving picture photographers.
The situation is quieter today, al
though there have been frequent
demonstrations in various sections of
the city. King Constantine's order of
the. day, in which he congratulated
his sailors, stirred the populace to
new efforts, and, for a time, it was

City of Excitement.
Athens, Oct. 18.—Marines from the
ships of the entente powers to the

streets of Athens swarmed with
Greeks frantically cheering King
Constantine and chanting the Greek
national anthem. Great crowds
marched through the streets, thou
sands gathering In the neighborhood
of the postoffice square.

square In order to prevent any clash
between Greek civilians and the
French, who occupied that section, es
tablishing a complete cordon about
the French and taking all precautions

streets hauling life-sized portraits of
the sovereign and wildly cheering for
the monarch.
Admiral Damianos. minister of ma

MAY REDUCE RESERVATION.
Tucson. Ariz., Oct. 18.—A tentative

It is well at this time that the west

dinary importance of Rumania to the
entire cause. Apart from any question
of sentiment, German occupation of
this country would give them great
oil flelds and a rich agricultural coun

make it manifest that the enemy will
