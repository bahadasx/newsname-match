FATHER ACTS UNNATURAL
Young Daughter is Worried in
to Taking Father's Life by His
Persistent Bad Attentions.
Lena Bonafiglio. a thirteen-year- j
old school girl, is a prisoner in the,
county jail charged with murder and
Frank Bonafiglio. aged 44 years, her
lather, lies dead at the Lynch-O*
born Undertaking Company's morgue,
his death being due to deep gashes ?
In his neck inflicted by his daughter
?with a hatchet after her father had
Attacked her for the purpose of com
mitting an unnatural act.
Dr. S. M. Mason, coroner, was
called to the Bonafiglio home shortly ,
after 2 o'clock Wednesday morning
and aftpr making an investigation
or the body hud It removed to the I
undertaking establishment to be pre- ,
pared for burial and had the girl
placed In the county jail to await;
the action of the cornorer's Jury
which will hold an inquest today or I
tomorrow.
In an interview in the county!
jail Wednesday morning, the girl
told her story of the whole affair in j
a cool, clear voice, not seeming to- j
realize the gravity of what she had |
dom\ She said her father had asked i
her several times on Sundays to take
a walk with him, and that on each
occasion they walked to the hills j
near their home at Tin Plate. It I
was on these excursions that her |
father first approached an unnatural
subject to her and told her that she !
would have to do what he told her, j
as he was her father and it was not J
right to disobey him. Each time she I
r.ald she objected and it made him j
iingry. The last walk taken by them |
was on last Sunday when he was j
more persistent than ever in carry-;
ing out his object, but she said she
escaped from him by running home. ?
When she reached home she told her ;
Another of the affair. This enraged
her father and he had been mad at
her over since. For some small of
fc fenso she committed Tuesday after
P noon, she says, he struck her.
She said she and her three small;
brothers went to bed at the usual i
time Tuesday night. She slept in a
room by herself. The next thing she i
remembered was when she was was !
awakened about midnight by her j
father who was standing over her>.
bed. She said he again started talk
ing about the subject and started to
get in the bed with her. She ob-1
jected and after a lot of arculng he i
finally left her and went to his room.
After he loft her room she was wor
ried and afraid that he would come
back again; so, she got out of bed.!
picked up a hatchet which was near;
the bed and went to her father's
room. He and her mother who were
1r. tho room were both asleep. She j
struck her father twice with the,
hatchet and returned to her room.
She did not. know he was dead until:
told at the jail Wednesday morning.
A short time afterwards, two men ,
who board at the house, came to her
room and told her to dress, and they
brought her to the city police station
here, where she was turned over to
the police. She was later moved to
the county jail.
The murdered man is survived by:
his widow, three sons and Lena, the;
daughter, who kiljed him. No funer-i
al arrangements have been made yet.

All over the County Are Enroll
ing in the Hughes Alliance in
Large Numbers.
f.MXIAL TO TH? T?t?OHAMI
NEW YORK, Oct. 18?The tre
mendous high enrollment in the j
Hughes alliance of Democrats from ;
tho southern states is strongly Big-,
niflcan of the great vote which Mr.
Ilughes will get from the Democra.ic I
ranks all over the country. Every,
day the Hughes alliance receives a I
large number of enrollment cards |
signed by men who report them
selves as life long Democrats. The
enrollment from southern states is!
naturally almost wholly Democratic,
and it has been large enough to war- ;
rant the establishment of Hughes al
liance branches in nine states south j
of the Mason and Dixon line. Tho
ninth state is Florida, headquarters
having just been opened in Jackson-1
ville. Charles F. Goldstrohm writes,1
from Duquesne, Pa., "You can en
roll me, a Democrat for forty years,
as a supporter of Charles E.
Hughes." John C. Carroll, of the
Third National Bank, St. Louis,
writes, "I have been a Democrat all
my life and assure you that I can be
even a better Republican after tho
present administration.

Valley Forge Heroes
Shamefully Defamed
? 1
Secretary of War Baker Casts I
Unforgivable Slurs Upon the
Fathers of Our Country.
NEW YORK/bc" "8?The heroes i
of Valley Forge and the boys of *76
wero just as had characters as the j
Mexican revolutionists of today, ac
cording to Newton D. Baker, secre
tary of war and special defender of
President Wilson and the adminis
tration's Mexican policy.
Mr. Baker made a speech in Jersey
City Monday night, in the course of
which he made this comparison of
George Washington and his old Con
tinetnals to Carranza and Villa ancj
the Mexican "patriots" of today. Mr.
Baker admitted that the Mexicans do
not respect American life and prop
erty, that they do not pay their debts,
that they desecrate churches, steal
and generally are worthless. "But
that is the customary thing in times
of revolution," he said. "That was
the way with Washington's army as
it marched to Valley Forge. Tho
Continentals stole the silver vessels
out of churches and sold them to buy
food and drink. They drove tho
priests and ministers out of churches
and sometimes out of tho country.
Their money was as worthless as the
Mexican money is today, and they
were in general Just as bad charac
ters as the Mexicans."
Mr. Raker peomed to believe that
this disparagement of tho soldiers of
the American revolution and this
comparison of them to the Mexican
bandits of today was an adequate de
fense of President Wilson and his
Mexican policy.

Judge Morrison, when introduced

and never before In the history of this

in a clearer manner than Judge Mor
