County Republicans Plan Rallies.
A largely attended meeting of Or
leans county Republicans was held at
the rooms of the Orleans club, Or
leans, yesterday afternoon and nearly
every town in the county was repre
sented. The meeting was called to
order by C. S. Skinner, Orleans coun
ty member of the Republican state
committee. Colby Stoddard of Or
leans was chosen secretary. The
meeting was for the purpose of de
ciding or ways and means for the
successful handling of the coming
campaign in the county.
The meeting was addressed by Hon.
H. F.Graham, candidate for governor;
S. B. Bates, state highway commis
sioner; A. H. Grout, state's attorney;
George Russell of Irasburg and M. A.
Adams of Derby, candidates for the
Vermont senate from this county;
Colby Stoddard, candidate for state's
attorney; W.W.Reirden, candidate for
Barton town representative, and by
nearly a score of others.
It was practically decided to hold
rallies in every town in the county
that wanted one, and to call upon the
state and national, committees for
.suitable speakers.
Many members of the county com
mittee were present and this com
mittee organized by choosing the fol
lowing officers: W. W. Reirden, chair
man; A. H. Grout, treasurer; Frank
O'Rourke, secretary, and an executive
committee consisting of the foregoing
officers, F. W. Tenney of Albany and
F. M Sears of Irasburg. The county
committee will work in hearty co
operation with C. S. Skinner, who rep--esents
the state committee.
The attendance and enthusiasm
shown speaks well for the success of
the republican ticket and an earnest
effort will be made to roll up an old
time Orleans county majority.

SERIES AUTO ACCIDENTS
One Fatal in Barton. Another in
Charleston Serious. Third
Minor Affair.
At least three automobile accidents
in the past few days are chronicled in
Orleans county.
One in Barton yesterday proved fa
tal to Louis Stratton, the eight-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Leon Stratton
of Lake street. The accident occurred
near the Congregational church where
Glover, Church, Elm and Mill streets
intersect at right angles. The Strat
ton lad was driving some cows from
Mill street to Elm for C. A. Nute,and
C. P. Jenness in his car was coming
up Glover street. On approaching the
cows Mr. Jenness slowed up as all
autoists find by experience it is wise
to do, but the Stratton boy darted
from behind one of the animals just
in time to get the full blow of the
Jenness car, which killed him instant
ly. Eye witnesses of the accident lay
no blame upon Mr. Jenness.
Sunday as the car of Mr. and Mrs.
John Austin of Irasburg was on the
road between West Charleston and
Derby, the car went over a bank when
turning out for a vehicle. Mrs. Aus
tin was driving and in the car were
Mr and Mrs. Levi Bashaw all of Iras
burg. Mr. Bashaw was quite severely
injured and most of the others sus
tained bruises or scratches, while the
car looks much the worse for the acci
dent. The last accident was to George
Jennings' car. F. H. Pillsbury was
driving it from Newport to Barton
for Mr. Jennings when the car skidded
on the slippery road and one wheel
was smashed in a roadside fence.

BARTON BOY ON BORDER
Howard Dutton Writes Monitor Com
plete Account of Texas Trip
with Militia.
Complying with the editor's request
for a story on his soldier-life experi
ence, Howard Dutton gave the Moni
tor the following:
When the president's call to mili
tiamen in old Vermont was issued, it
was not long in being answered from
all quarters, and soon the armories
were full of eager youths ready for
rthey knew not what.
As for Co. L, hardly a moment was
used for leisure while at Newport and
soon we were on the train moving
toward the mobilization camp at Bur
lington. We started early in the
morning, hot so early that the people
of Newport did not give us a hearty
send-off.
Flags were out at farmhouses, and
at small villages where we stopped
along the way, many, many farewells
were given us.
At Burlington the scene became
one of intense anxiety and specula
tion as to what place in Texas we
were to concentrate and whether we
would enter Mexico or not. We were
soon relieved, however, when it was
learned that Eagle Pass was to be
our destination. Before we hardly
realized it, we were on the day coach
es provided for us, and the fields of
old Vermont were fast disappearing.
Night overtook us in a strange state,
yes, a strange state of mind, also.
Day coaches are not so bad to sleep
in if a fellow is really tired, and we
were soon in the land of nod. Next
day New York state appeared with
more excitement, and at Jamestown
the girls were not satisfied to stand
on the platform and bid us farewell,
but had to be gently lifted up into the
car windows, and believe us, let down
with more reverence. Ask any fellow
who went through Jamestown what
he thinks of the place, it won't take
long for an answer. During the trip
through New York the car that was
unfortunately ours had a hot-box, and
oil had to be used at every station.
We had not slept long that night
when the call for "all out" was heard.
We expected that Mexico had made
good her threat against New York or
Washington, and sleepy-eyed we took
our guns and packs. It was soon evi
dent we would have to give up our
car as we could see fire riaring out
around the wheels.
It was a long time before the imag
ination could grasp what kind of a
j Air i "j
tnmg we were on at Jiirie. At nrst it j
looked as if we were cninp" nn t.h.- !
canal on a barge. After drifting a
short distance, we were fully awake,
however, (awake to the fact that the
Erie railroad had slipped something
over on us) then speculation went riot
as to what kind of a car we were in,
some said electric, others box, still
others vowed it was a hand car, but
just at this point the major came in
and settled it by saying that was the
best car he could get. Dissatisfied,
we hung our shoes over the bell rope,
bringing the train to a stop. After
things were at a standstill we ar
ranged ourselves for the night;
Some nestled in the hat racks,
Others held on the strings,
A few turned up the backs of seats,
Making a kind of swing.
Chicago brought us to the next
point of interest. Chicago has the
largest stockyards in the world. We
stopped there over half an hour, hold
ing our hands over our no?es. That
wasn't all, Before we were on our
way again, the cooks came out with
corned beef and bread, (exit cooks
with corned beef and bread )
The western country has a same
ness which is not altogether pleasing,
although we enjoyed the beauty of
the golden wheat fields, and our first
sight of the fields of cotton. At
Kansas City we were allowed to leave

H., where she resides. She was re
membered by a shower of postcards
from friends.
Mrs. Emily Baker, who has been in
the West for some time, was the
guest of Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Cutler
the first of the week on her way to
her home in West Glover. Mrs. Bak
er's daughter, Mrs. Levi Wild, of Roy
alton, was also a guest at Mr. and
Mrs. Cutler's.
The teachers' reception given by
the W. C. T. U. was held at the home
of Mrs. C. F. Cutler last evening. A
large number were present and the
Magazine and Newspaper Prices Will
Increase.
In common with the increased cost
of almost everything many newspa
pers and magazines have increased or
soon will increase their prices to the
public. . .
This will serve notice upon the
large number of people who subscribe
for their newspapers and magazines
through the Monitor that any or all
prices quoted heretofore are with
drawn. As soon as possible a new
a new list showing new prices will be
issued. i
Several magazines go up on No
vember 1 or soon thereafter. Until
that date we shall accept subscrip
tions at the old rate . One of the
most notable is the Christian Herald,
which goes to $2 after the first of
November. Before then our old pric
es will prevail.
We advise any and all who can do
so to renew their subscriptions to all
the magazines and newspapers they
intend to take immediately. Paper
has reached such a price as to make
it impossible for many publications to
continue at the old price.
Body of North Troy Suicide Found
Dangling from Tree.
James Wentworth of North Troy,
aged 77 years, committed suicide by
hanging Oct. 11, his body being found
suspended from a small tree about
7.20 in the evening after a searching
party had started out for him. There
is no known reason for his act other
than despondency.
Mr. Wentworth was called to din
ner by hiswife, but replied that he
was not hungry, and his wife sat
down alone. When last seen he was

4 President Wilson seeks to jus- 4
4 tify himself on the ground that 4
It was "futile" and dangerous to
"stand firmly." This Is an appeal
41 that can with equal truth be 4
made by every soldier who runs 4s
4 away in battle. He further al- 4
4 leges his belief that the cause he 4
4 championed "has the sanction of 4s
4& the judgment of society in its fa- 4
4 vor." I remember thirty-odd 4
4s years ago in the Black Hills a 4s
4 local vigilance committee which 4
4 was in doubt about hanging a 4
4 suspected wrongdoer. While they 41
were discussing the matter, there 4s
4 appeared over the neighboring di- 4
4 vide a frowsy, elderly horseman 4
4 in a linen duster, who promptly 41
4 galloped towards them waving 41
4s his arms and shouting "Hang 41
him! Hang him!" The leader of
4s the vigilantes at once asked the 4
41 frowsy stranger what he knew 4
41 of the facts, whereupon the 41
4? stranger" answered: "I do not 41
know anything about the facts, 4
4 and I never saw the man before; 41
bat there's eleven cf 3ou and 41
tlf- only one of him, and I believe in 4
if majority rule!" This is merely
if- a picturesque paraphrase of what 4s
4 Mr. Wilson calls action under 4s
4 "the sanction of society."' It 4
4 exemplifies the principle upon 4
4s which President Wilson has act- 4
41 ed in those public matters, inter- 4
4s nal and external, where he was 4s
& threatened with the use of force. 4
