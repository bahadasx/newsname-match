HOW MEN WHO ARE OUT
OF COUNTY MAY VOTE
In order that vote' who may be ab
Bent from the county on election day
may have a clearer idea of their priv
ileged under the new election law, S.
C. Durbin, chairman of the county
election board, gave out the following
explanations to a representative of
the Daily Express this morning:
Under the election law passed at the
recent special session of the legisla
ture, a registered voter of the state
who Is unavoidably absent from the
county of his residence may vote in
dence, giving the reasons therefor. The
inspector will endorse on the registra
tion certificate the date of the election
and the precinct in which the elector
voted and sign his name. He will
theu hand the elector both state and
county ballots. The voter, with pen
and ink will strike out names of can
didates tor "ounty and district offi
cers for which he is not entitled to
vote and write Instel the names of
candidates for whom he is entitled to
vote and stamp his ballot in the usual
Buy precinct of the state in which he . manner,
Is temporarily located.
In order to do so, he will present
The inspector is required to forward
the ballots and affidavit of the yoter
his registration certificate to the pre-! by registered mail to the secretary of

tiie use of both quinine and arsenic
preparation hypodermically and into
the veins. The various forms of ma
laria were discussed and the differ
ence in the treatment of each form
was mentioned.
Dr. S. L. Morgan, associated with
the Pasteur institute at Oklahoma
City, read a, very comprehensive paper
on hydrophobia or rabies and the
present method of treatment. His sug
gestions aa to the proper ' procedure
in cases of suspected dogs or animals
are: First, if possible to avoid doing
so, do not kill a supposedly rabid dog.
Keep him securely chained or confin
ed for ten day. If the living anijnal
remains healthy during the ten days
confinement no rabies is present. As
long as it remains healthy it should
not be killed and there is no need to
send It for laboratory diagnosis. If an
animal suspected of rabies dies its
head should be sent immediately to
the Pasteur institutione or the state
board of health laboratory. In warm
weather always put the dog's head in
ice before Bending by express. If the
er-oi't oC li.u institute states that the
animal had rabies any one infected
by the saliva of the animal tyther
through a bito or other wounds,
should immediately begin Pasteur
treatment at his physician's office, for
it is not necessary to come to the in
stitute for treatment as the treatment
is sent out successfully by mail to the
physicians. In all localities where
rabies 'is known to have been present
all dogs should be muzzled. All dogs
known to have been bitten by a rabid
dog should be killed. As an essential
preliminary measure all wounds made
s nal should be cauterized im
mediately with commercial formalin
and this should not bo neglected after
a delay of one or two days.
Dr. C. J. Fishnian of Oklahoma City
read a paper on the newer methods of
blood examination in relation to dis
eases, his paper being enjoyed very
much by the physicians doing labora
tory work.
Dr. W. J. Wallace of Oklahoma City
discussed the subject of latest meth
ods of treating a disease which- he j
emphasized the fact that the success!
of the treatment depended greatly on
the thoroughness of the physician in
checking up his treatment by a labo
ratory and blood test.
Dr. J. M. Cooper of Oklahoma City
discussed the effect of constipation re
sulting in disease of the rectum and
what would be a successful treatment
for these conditions. The last paper
was by Dr. W. II. Livermore of Chick
asha on focal affections. This paper
showed very clearly the results of the
work that is being .icne In the investi

CO. ROAD
MEETING

"Indications point to a large meet
ing in Chickasha Monday evening,"
said Dr. It. J. Gordon, of Ninnckah,
referring to the good roads gatliwing
that is to be held at the city hall on
October 23 for the purpose of taking

ance of bonds for roads and bridges

a movement was initiated looking to
a largo bond issue for hard-surface

tions concerning the cost to the tax
payers and this committee will report
at the next meeting. "I find senti
ment in favor of the bond issue grow

we are going to accomplish some
thing this time. We hope to have as
many citizens of the county present as
possible when we meet next."
