RESUME OF
DOINGS ON
(By Assoc Is ted Press.) -
With the occupation of Athena and
Plreaua by marines from the war
ship of the entente powers, a tense
situation has arisen in Athena. Great
crowds of royalists have paraded the
streets of the Greek capital, cheering
the king and cordons of Greek troops
and marines have been thrown about
the railway stations, city ball, and
other polnta occupied by the entente
forces to prevent clashes between
them and the royalists. An unofficial
dispatch says Admiral Du Fournet
was hissed by the throngs In the
streets of Athens, and that a detach
ment of French sailors was driven
back by the hostile crowd.
King Constantlne, In a speech to
the officers of his fleet, told him he
would stand by them, no matter what
consequences might follow their loy
alty to Greece.
.Volhynia, Oallcla and Transylvania
are still the points where the heavi
est fighting is taking place. Along
the Somme In France, bombardments
alone have prevailed, except to the
east of Belloy-en-Santerre, where the
Germans threw two vain attacks
against the French.
In Macedonia, the hostilities have
been confined mainly to patrol en
gagements and artillery duels.
