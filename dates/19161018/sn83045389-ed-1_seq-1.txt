.ST. LOU IK. MO., October IT.?The (
bouse of deputies of the General Con
vention of the Protestant Episcopal
Church to-day voted to eliminate the
special prayers for the President of
llie United States from the' morning
and evening prayer services and to s-ub
wtitute for them a prayer for the safety j
and preservation of th*- nation rh?
same prayer will be used In both ser- I
vices.
As it is now in tlic prayer b?> ?!?*. the
morning prayer an Us lor the l'rt isielent '
the boon "lit health an') t r?'Hsjeriiy
long to live," and that he finally may
attain everlasting Joy and l.-lioity. 1
The new prayer is adopted for l>oti:
services, and, while asking that tho ;
Pre-sioeiit ".intl all others in authority ' |
be given "the* wisdom and stren*Ml to j
know and to do "Thy will'." makes no
roCetcnco to Ions life. health, pros*
perlty or eternal felicity.
The houso also votod, d'-splt'- vh; ?
orous protests, to omit the wo.'Js, !
"The Governor of this .State" from the
evening prayer, it being argued "thai
all others in authority"' Included the
Governors.
The change must be approved by
the house of bishops and by the next
general convention before it can be
come effe-etive.
Ilev. l.eighton Parks. of N'fw York,
who spoke in favor of the cliantre.
the present prayer in the morning
service was an adaptation of the prayer

the Church of England. and that it

In the house of deputies the day
TiiiCffttV was oee\:pie<i by the reading
of the proposed changes in the l.cok
of Common Prayer. The house or I?:>li -
ops. holding it* meeting behind closed
di-.ir.s also spent the day considering
t |n> proposed changes.
Skillful parliamentary maneuvering
saved the resolution admitting women
to membership in the house of depu
ties from being killed by an adverse
committee report. From the ti-i- of
the cluire\*'? first convention, in Piii;:>
iielphia. ii 17sr.. mesi only hav.
allowed to represent <iioe.se- on th?
jloor. P.efore the .idvers" report was
acted on to-day, a motion was maeb
which put tlie original resolution on
the calendar, thus gi\ing it a chanc.;
for discussion in tljo house.
Cognizance of the European war was
taken in both houses of thV convention
to-day. From the house of bisnops
came the announcement that the pas
toral letter this year will "or.tain
,nessage to the communicants of the
' church "in view of the present worid
crisis." This letter is read in each
Protestant Episcopal Church in the
l.'iiitee' States. Steps looking for an
ofllcia.1 expression on methods tending
to minimize war were tak- n to-day
when the house of deputies adopted a
resolution which proposed that a com
mittee of three clergymen and thre.
laymen be appointed to draw up a re*,
olution, embodying 111rsideas. The
house of bishops concurred in the ac
tion.
A larger religious life in the hoine?
of the United States was urged in a
resolution introduced in the house of
deputies by the Ilev. Charles N". Tyn
dell, of W'illlamsport, Pa. This reso
lution, which was referred to a com
mittee, provides for a committee e>f
live bishops, five < le rgvmen and live
laymen "'to study the whole; eiuestion
of the present status and condition of
the home and family life of the peo
ple of the United States in its relation
in religion and morals," making a re
port to the l??p.i convention.

duct of the business of the church,
coupleel with a Itrger publicity for
church propaganda, was; urged by del
egates to the General Convention of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, in session
here, to-day.
^ Ilev, James Wise, of St. f.ouis, suf
fragan bishop-elect e.f Kansas, has |
drafted a resolution calling for a per
manent church publicity commission.
"In e>ur churches wo can reach many,
but it is through the newspapers and
other periodicals that, an best
reach the man outside," ho said. "We
?r<- coming to the peiint where we must
realize that I he- church, like till other
large organizations interested in
molding public sentiment, can best elo
it through organized publicity."

ci.vwcks is rit<;r.i>
A report e>f the jo>nt commission on
business etlleiency urges new systems
of handling parochial, diocesan and
provincial linanc.'s, the regular audit
ing of the funds by "outside" account
ants and the handling of such finances
in trust funds.
"The. church is a large business e-on
cej-n, to all intents and purposes." said
Robert S. 1'ruyn, of Albany. N. V.,
chairman of the committee, comment
Ing to-day on the report. "Conse
quently wo must handle its business
?s wo would that of any firm."
The house of deputies to-day de
feated ft proportion that the "Te Ileum,"
