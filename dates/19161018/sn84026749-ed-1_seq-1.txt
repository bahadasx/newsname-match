Rumor That Washington Fran
chise in American League is
' To Be Shifted Denied.
STOCKHOLDERS SATISFIED
Clark Griffith Joins Others in
Scouting Theory That a
Change Is Contemplated.
By LOUIS A. DOUGHER.
The Washington American Lcaguo
franchlso la not going to bo transferred
io Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, or Toronto, ac
cording to officials of tho local organ
isation, and thoy express tho hope that
their doclslvo statements to this effect
will effectually squelch rumors that
have been appearing In Now York
papers over slnco tho world's series.
'There Isn't a word of truth In any
story that tho franchise will bo trans
ferred," said W. Harrlman Ropley,
treasurer or the club, today. "Thcro
nover has been any truth In these
ntorles. it would cost a whole lot of
money to dispose of tho holdings In
Washington.
Stock Always for Sale.
"Speaking for myself, I may say, with
Mr. Lannln, president of the Hcd Sox.
my stock Is always for sale, If I can
get the prlco I want. But It Isn't the
prlco you hear talked of In the streets.
I don want to sell. I'm satisfied, and
ho aro all the other stockholders. But
ns for taking the club out of town,
that's all wrong. Wo were never In bet
ter financial shape than we are now. Our
debts amount to little or nothing. We
have a 100.000 mortgage on our plant,
ftnd that runs for twenty years, so I
can't see why wo should be bothered
with theso rumors. Thcy'ro untrue."
'The wholo story Is untrue. It has
been cropping up frequently, but It's
untrue," was what President Benjamin
8. Minor had to say of the rumor from
New York.
Manager Clark C. Griffith, the largest
Individual stockholder In tho club, was
most emphatic In his denial of the
story.
"Let's kill this story once and for
nil," said he, "It has been Instigated
by a lot of small towns out of Jealousy.
Ualtlrrioro and St. Louis hay? been
great rumor-mongers along this llns.
"'h$$$cltiited Shift.
V "I jM'-aaUsneawVut' conditions: I am
thankful to all our supporters here and
have lievor considered shifting to Bal
timore, Toronto, or Brooklyn, as some
have1 wrltUn. All I can say Is that the
next tlmo this story comes to the sur
face the fans should treat It as a
Joke."
The latest story hns the local fran
chise shifted to Brooklyn, using Eb
bets Field with tho Dodgers, cham
pions of the National League. Man
iiger Griffith laughs loudest at this
because, as he says, "Brooklyn never
was a good ball town nnd Isn't as
Rood as Baltimore right now. and
everybody knows where Baltimore
stands In comparison with Washing
ton." President Barrows, of the Interna
tional League, whllo admitting today
that Toronto may be a big league
aspirant after the European war, says
that it Is not now seeking member
ship In th American League.

Into Market.
,Jrt!W YORK. Oct. 18. Charges tnat

Hughes at 10 to 8 and 10 to 7 yesterday,
,000 was reported offered today on
the curto. Fred Bchumm, of "Brooklyn,

clared Wilson supporters held out for
10 to 8. M ,

Says Lack of Cars

Head of Farmers' Congress Biamejs
High Prices on Congestion
of Transportation.
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 18. Conges
tion of transportation Is tho Indirect
cause of the steady advance In the
prlco of foodstuffs, II. E. Stockbrldgc,
president of the Farmers' National Con
gress, said today.
"Our distribution system Is faulty,"
said Stockbrldge. "In one place some
class of food Is nbundant and tho
price Is low and In another place It
Is impossible to purchase the same
product at a reasonable price.
"Railroads say that It is 'shortage
of cars.' But It Is really a congested
condition ot transportation facili
ties."
The farmers are planning to go to
Congress to get relief for the car
shortage. A Federal Investigation may
be asked.
Stockbrldge pointed out) that last
summor farmers of the wtujat bolt had
to pllo millions of bushels of wheat on
the ground becauso they were, unable

DELAY SETTLEMENT
OF LUSJT1A CASE
State Department to Hold
Agreement on Submarines
Secret Until After Election.
Settlement of the Lusitania case, which
brought the United States to the brink
of war with Germany, will be delayed
until after the November election.
This was authoritatively stated in the
pilghest official quarters today after pub
lication by the New York Sun of an
article stating that President Wilson
had accepted the terms of a proposal
In which the German government held
the sinking of tho Lusitania was Justifi
able, but the destruction of American
lle was contrary to International law
and nn occasion for deep regret.
Acting Secretary of State Polk au
thorized the following statement:
"The Lusitania note has not been ac
cepted. It will not be given out. The
State Department will not be drawn Into
a discussion of a case of this Importance
at this time."
Would Not Discuss Articles.
Mr. Polk would not discuss the state
ment made In the Sun article, which
was reproduced In tno noon edition of
Th Tlms-1liat "the United States
recognitca thnt the. .attack of tho. Ger-,
"JSJ?! V " T, X 1&

Hlit rnfllfn Hid tvilnf !- iY Xnmm nt
- . asv jywssa v aw,
American lives was not justified." He'
reiterated that he would he drawn Into
no discussion whatever.
From the discussion of (he Lusltnnla
case following published articles, how
ever. It was clearly lndlcnted that the
State Department does not consider
this a propitious time In which to close
Lusitania negotiations.
In the lluht of today's develop
ments new significance was seen In
the authorized statement by Secre
tary Lansing yesterday that he Is
"quite opposed to bringing foreign
aAalrs Into domestic politics."
Lansing Would Not Consent.
There Is highest authority for the
statement that Secretary Lansing
would not for a moment consent to
concluding the Lusitania and allied
submarine negotiations at a time
when such notion might be used to
tnfluenco domestic politics.
If any steps are taken toward
bringing the Lusitania negotiations
to a close It was apparent they will
have to be dictated from Shadow
Lawn,
The Lusitania caso now rests where
it did when Secretary Lnnslnr an
nounced more than six monthsago
that the plan of settlement proposed
by Berlin was "substantially satis
factory." Then came the Sussex trag
edy, and the Lusitania settlement was
held uo until, the United States as
sured Itself that German Dlednes were
worth more than the paper they were
written upon.
Wouldn't Disavow Sinking.
There waB no secret when the Lusi
tania proposals were made that Ger
many refused to disavow In specific
terms the sinking of the Lusitania.
but It was then announced Germanv
had. admitted, the destruction of
American lives was not Justified. The
killing of American Was then, as now,
the chief bone of contention.
It Is accepted that the assurances
lven by Germany In settlement ot the
ussex case were satisfactory to the
United States,, and that final agree
ment on the submarine Issue was de
ferred only until the United States as
sured Itself that Germany would keep
her pledges. It also la accepted that
the United States now Is assured Ger
many Is conducting legal submarine
operations.
But officials today Tnade It plain that,
although satlsflod the submarine Issue,
as It relates to. past offenses, 1b closed,
It will not be officially closed until the
present campaign ends.

200-WORD NOTE.
"The note, which has been the sublei
of diplomatic speculation for months. Is
approximately 300 words long, and In
formal In character. It Is addressed :a
'My Dear Mr. Secretary and slimed
simply 'J. Bernstorff.'
"The ambassador states that his gov
ernment, desirous of reaching a satis
factory settlement with regard to the
Lusitania, has given him Instructions as
to Germany's position, which Is based
on the conferences which Secretary
Lansing and Count von Bernstorff had
on tho matter.
"The nolo then proceeds to cover tho
three points about which the negotia
tions revolved regret, reparation. In
demnity. But the agreement on these
lines is not what It was understood to
be at the time.
"The United States recognizes that the
attack, of the German submarine com
mander on the passenger ship Lusitania
was Justifiable, but makes the point
that tho loss of American lives was not
justified. The German government ex
presses deep regret and authorize
Count von Bernstorff to undertake nego
tiations for. arranging a "suitable In
demnity" for tho American lives lost.
Followed Conferences.
"Recdgnltlon by the United States that
the German U-boat commander was
justified In sinking the Lusitania fol
lowed. It Is explained, a. long series of
conferences between Secretary Lansing
and Count vo nBernstorff over the
question of Oermany's right to retaliate
against Great Britain's - blockade by
sinking all British ships found on tb
high seas.
"Secretary Lansing desired tho Ger
man government to express 'disavowal
of the act' In tho terms of settlement,
but tills Germany, It now develops, has
declined to do. Count von Bernstorft
took the ground that disavowal meant
that the aot was Illegal. Ho .contended
that It was retaliation against Great
Britain's Illegal blockade, and therefore
juaUnable.
"After debating the question of legality
of the act for weeks, the State Depart
ment, It now appears, yielded te Ger
many on this point. The sinking of ths.
Lusitania was justifiable, according to,
the. terms of settlomcut. but. the de
struction of American lives was con
trary to international law and'tin Iftcca,
slon for deep regret.
Note on Lansing's Desk.
"The terms of the Lusitania settle
ment may formally be announced any
day by Secretary Lanslne. The Ger
man ambassador's noto Is on his desk
and practically all he has to do Is
io make It public to close the .case,
ir. Lapsing has statod that ho has
agreed to the terms as contained In
the note, ,
"After the attack on tho Sussex last
April he said he would hot make the
note public until he was assured that
Germany's pledge would be kept.
President Wilson naa now, six months
later, stated that he has no right to
question Oermany's pledget and Secre
tary Lansing says that during tie
last six months there has been no
violation of It. Count von Bernstorff
therefore Is understood to feel that
his note of February 16 should be pub-
, usned.

lieve that the President would author
ize its nuhllcatlon lust lirlor to "lec
tion In order that It might appear ns
another "diplomatic victory," but the
