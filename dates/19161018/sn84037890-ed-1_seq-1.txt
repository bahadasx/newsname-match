J. R. WELLER, Pres.
HENRY M. PIRTLE. Sec'y.
Now since the national union of
the A. S.. of E. Is willing and has
been spending money by sending
men to our county to reorganize U3
into the American Society of Equity,
and since we all know and are will
ing to admit that the A. S. of E. is
the only and the best real farmers
organization we have ever had, and
since we have reorganized tho coun
ty union and have a. nice little to
bacco pool for Hartford delivery,
why not every one return and show
their alleglence to 'the order again
and show tho Northwestern members
that we have not forgotten how to
do things In Kentucky?
Some of the old members that
have always stood faithful and al
ways been in the harness havo been
working hard to assist the men that
the national organization has sent
among us and without compensation.
Now the national office is getting
tired of this without "the members,
or rather farmers, taking more In
terest In the work, and cannot and
will not, keep their men In the field
much longer unless We take more In
terest. t So now I beseech you,
brethren, don't stand back to see
what tho other fellows are going to
do, for they aro watching you. I
beg you to please come forward
with your part and let us get busy
and do things. You are charged no
dues and you pay only a small per
cent on the business you dp. So
you see every ono pays according to
what benefit he gets out of It.
Respectfully,
HENRY 51. PIRTLE.

ANGRY MOB
HANGS
AND BURNS
BODIES
Of Two Negro Men At
Paducah, Ky.
FIVE THOUSAND SPECTATORS
Watch Double Lynching Siege
and Hanging Process Last-
ed Five Hours.
AHMED MEN STORM THE JAIL
Paducah, Ky., Oct. 10. Hanging
Brack Klnley, a negro, accused of
an assault on a white woman, and
Jesse Thornhlll, another negro, who
made a remark deploring the pro
posedlyuchlng, to thesanie limb, a
mob of i00 armed men and boys,
who had stormed the McCracken
county jail seized Klnley at noon to
day, Ilred about 1,000 shots Into the
writhing bodies of their victims and
thou set them on fire.
Tho double lynching followed a'
siege and assault of the county jail,
which lasted for five hours and cul
minated In the negro Klnley being
taken to the scene of the assault
Friday on Mrs. Etta Rose, wife of
O. D. Rose, a mechanic at the Illi
nois Central shops here, who had
been robbed, beaten and criminally
assaulted by a negro at her homo, a
mile from the city on the Poole road.
Mrs. Rose identified Klnley as her
assailant.
The negro Thornhlll, an employe
at the Illinois Central shops, was ov
erheard to remark that the "lynch
ing was a dirty shame and he'dldn't
blamo Klnley." He was seized by
members ef the mob, searched and
relieved of a loaded revolver and
hanged by the mob first. Thornhlll,
It is alleged, had threatened to "kill
some white man."
As the negroes were choking to
death tho mob firpd fully 1,000
shots into their bodies and then
built a fir? under them. The flames
caught the hanging men'3 clothing,
and in ha'f an hour the ropes were
burned in two. The burning bodies
dropped into the fire below and were
consumed.
While I'Inley was presented to
Mrs. Ross for her Identification, the
other was taken to a tree, a rope
thrown over a limb, his neck en
circled in a noose and an automobile
hRch-.'d to the other end. As soon
as Klnley had been Identified as the
assailant of tho woman, ho was led
to tho same tree and the process re
peated. Five thousand men, women and
children witnessed the lynching.
Hundreds went in automobiles to
the scene of the hanging. For sev
eral days a lynching had been threat
ened openly on the streets. A mob
had pursued tire negro arter the as
sault on Mrs. Rose Friday, threat
ening summary vengeance. The mob
began gathering shortly after C
o'clock this morning and tho lynch
ing occurred just before noon.
The spectators mounted a rail
road trestle In the Immedlato vicin
ity, one of the points of vantage.
While Klnley was taken to tho Rose
home, the leaders of the mob resolv
ed to hang Thornhlll. Pleading for
his life, tho boy was bound and ex
ecuted. In a few minutes It was an
nounced that Mrs. Rose had satisfi
ed herself of the Identity of Klnley.
He was hanged to the same tree and
a number of sjiots tired Into his
body. Quietly and methodically the
mob gathered a quantity of wood,
built a fire and placed the bodies of
both negroes upon it.
By order of the Board of City
Commissioner all saloons In Padu
cah were closed at noon as a pre
caution against a possible race riot.
This was the first lynching In Mc
Cracken county for about twenty
five years.
Only a few of tho mombers of tho
mob were masked. There was no
attempt by the sheriff's office or the
police to arrest any of tho lynchers.
The mob stormed the jail, held
tho Jailer and deputies at bay and
chiseled the bars of tho cell con
taining Klnlfy. ,
It was the expressed determina
tion of the mob to make suro that
the negro was the woman's assailant
by havlng'her ldontlfy him, in which
event ithoy said they luteuded to
hang him. .

HUNDREDS OFDARKIES COMING

Officials To Keep
Cloce Watsh.
PROSECUTIONS WILL FOLLOW
Washington, Oct. 14. It became
known to-day that the Department
of Justice has taken cognizance of
the claims of prominent business
men that the. large number 'of ne
groes who are being persuaded to
leave the South, particulaily the cotton-growing
States, and come North,
ostensibly to work, are in reality be
ing brought into doubtful States to
participate In the national election.
Whether or nut iiii'Se nonpartisan
claims and fears are justified, it de
velops that the department has been
in correspondence with Its District
Attorneys in various States, and the
closest watch is to be kept for elec
tion frauds.
In some Instances, it is reliably
asserted, the District Attorneys back
up the suspicions of Democratic pol
iticians, and have assured the de
partment that they will be vigilant
before and on election day.
Ohio, Indiana and Michigan are
paid to be receiving hundreds of la
borers imported from tho South. It
was declared to-day that the two
Democratic candidates for the Sen
ate in Indiana, Senators TaggaU and
Kern, were among the first Demo
crats, to suspect a vote-getting
scheme, "and their- fears are reflected
in other Democratic quarters.
The Department of Justice, it ap
pears, has begun an Investigation of
the exodus from the South, and
there will be relentless prosecutions
in the event "colored ringers" are
voted in any State.
Prosecutions aro to be made re
gardless of whether Imported voters
cast their ballota for the Democratic
or Republican tickets.
It lias been charged in Democratic
circles, however, that the Republic
an party Is more likely to benefit by
the influx of hosts of negro voter3
from the South, and it is intimated
that large sums are being expended
to bring tho Southern laborers to
Northern States.
Tho Republican vote In the South,
It Is pointed out, is negligible, but in
close States the oliange of a few
hundred votes might affect the re
sult of tlio Presidential, Senatorial
and Congressional elections.
Thero Is authority for the state
ment that tlie Department of Jus
tice, aside from the question of par
tisanship, will insist that District At
torneys be on the alert on election
day.

'T FOLLOW FALSE LEADER
Back Into Camp Of the Old
Guard He Stands For
Worthy Principle.
WANTS FRIENDS TO DO SAME
Weir, Kan., Oct. 11, 191 fi.
To The Herald and Its Readers:
On the eve of tlie election for Presi
dent of the greatest Republic In the
world, I feel it my duty to express
myself on some things of vital inter
est to myself and all other persons
who have to earn a livelihood by
work. As many persons in Ohio
county know, four years ago I was
an ardent supporter of the Progres
sive ticket, because I felt that the
principles advocated by thorn were
for the best interests of tlie common
people and would better conditions
for every one. It is now a matter of
history how our leader lias deserted
his party which he helped to create
and has Joined hands with the old
guard of the Republican party who
stand for the same old things that
Mark Haiinn, Matt Quay and Joseph
G. Cannon stood for a quarter of a
century ago, so I am not willing to
be a party to such a backward st";i
in our political progress as our erst
while booted and spurred leader
would havo us take. No doubt som
staid old Democrat who may rea-1
this article will use that worn-out
phrase "Chickens come home to
roost," but I do not care whsjt is
said, I try to vote for a principle as
I seo it, and when I tevlow the noble
and glorious work done In the past
three and one-half years by a Demo
cratic President and a Democratic
Congress, I am free to say without
fear of successful contradiction that
more Progressive, remedial legisla
tion has been enacted and enforced
than lias been effected since the Civ
il War. To point out just a few of
the many things, I might refer to the
Child Labor Law, tlie Widow's Pen
sion, the Federal Reserve, the re
cent Adamson Law to avert tho
threatened railroad strike and oth
ers too numerous to mention. Presi
dent Wilson has been severely crit
icised for not taking more decided
action townrdGermany.No other man
could have handled a situation so
acuto with such a master hand as he
has done without involving our na
tion in that terriblo calamity, war.
Why any falrmlnded man should
want to plunge our country Into that
maelstrom of death and destruction
unless our Government was drawn
Into it in such manner that our na
tional honor could In no other way
be preserevd, Is more than I can un
derstand. The motto that tho good
mothers of California have adopted
as their slogan applies very forcibly:
"I did not raise my boy to go to
war." Just think of the homes bro
ken up, tho crippled, the lame, the
blind and maimed for llfo that might
have been caused by ono misstep of
our President nnd Congress. I am
not in favor of peace at any price,
but I am for peace so long as war
can bo averted by any honorable
means. 1
Now, as to Mr. Hughes policy of
campaigning. He has utterly failed
to produce any argument that prom
ises anything for the future. He
has spent his time and breath crit
icising Wilson from overy angle and,
so far, in this part of tho country lias
only weakened his own position and
strengthened Wilson's. A vote for
Hughes means a vote for a possibil
ity, while Wilson stands on a record
that no man need bo asliamed of. so
I can speak for one, that Wilson and
men of Wilson's kind are good
enough for me.
In closing, I wish to urgo upon ov
ery ono of my friends, be they Dem
ocrats, Progressives or Republicans, .
let us not fall to cast a vote for Wil
son, tho friend of tlie common peo
ple, and especially tho laboring men
of this great country.
Go tp tho polls and vote, rain or
shine, and let us show the money
barons of Wall Street that tho peo
plo still rule and not the few.
