SENATOR FULTON DECLARES
DEMOCRATS BROKE PLEDGES
Former United mates Senator
Charles W. Fulton addressed a large
crowd at the Oregon theatre last night
In N'tvilf of the election of Chnrlea E.
Hughes for president of the United
fifties The meeting was attended by
a number of out of town visitors from
... it. in the county. Music
was furnished by Mrs. Ralph Haling I
of Weston wno renueieu
llKhtful oo "m,h appreciated solos
end a male quartet.
fJenafr Fulton wns Introduced by
Judge Btephen A. Lowell.
Mr. Fulton declared that the Uni
te,) States Is on the verge of a great
rrlls and consequently the present
political campaign is one of the most
Important.
"The Issues are these. said Mr.
Fulton, "the question of a sound bus
iness and flnnnclal policy; the ones
tlon of good faith and honesty In
carrying out the promises of the
pnrtv to the people, and the question
of loyalty to the constitution, our flag
onrt our Institutions."
The speaker then devoted the re
tralnder of the evening to the criti
cism of the democratic party during
the present administration. "The
democratic party," said Mr. Fulton,
"has proved Itself Incompetent to
conduct the government along a
"ound business nnd financial basis.
They have actunlly Increased the cot
of living Instead of lowering It a third
flKhl against liquor. The first tem
perance meeting on this continent
was hold by an Indian council In the
St. Laurence valley In 1(4!). she said.
The first temperance lecturer was
Cornplanter, a Senaca chief. The
first congressional law pawed to cur
tail the liquor traffic was passed In
response to the plea of Little Turtle.
The first petition for legal prohibi
tion wai presented to President Jack
son by the Cherokee, the aame tribe
which drafted tribal laws ugain.t
drinking before the white man had
ever lifted a hand against the evil.
The pioneer prohibition worker in
Kansas for prohibition was Satantn
chief or the Klowas."and in South
Dakota It was Red Thunder She al
io recalled the part the Indian tem
perunc society at Tulullla had play
ed in the fight for prohibition In
1914
The Onward MarHi.
In discussing tne onward march
made by the cause of temperance
during the past year. Mrs. Kemp re
marked upon Russia's order making
prohibition permanent, upon the fact
that Finland has for the second time
voted dry, that Norway hag forbidden
the manufacture of liquor, that
France has abolished absinthe, that
Germany has reduced the manufac
ture of beer 50 per cent, that Rou
manian first war measure was an r
der against the use or liquor, that
nrent Isrltain still restricts the num.
ber of public houses and the hours of
fnle. that Canada Is mostly "white"
nnd that Lloyds have refused to In
Hiiro the palooninen of California
against prohibition.
Nhe urged that the organisation
press the battle for national prohibi
tion In this country and urged all
unions and church societies to me
morialise congress to refer the ques
tion to states.
Kesulta In Oregon.
In discussing the first year of pro
hibition in Oregon, she sa'd that the
results had proved the falsity of the
predictions of the wet workers. Oro-1
cers. tailors, restaurant men and oth-1
er DUSiness men were reauy io iwn
(Continued on Page S.)
more than It was at the time they
came Into power. I do not charge the
democratic party with the reponsl
blllty of all of this Increase, but I do
maintain that the party, honest as
they are. In their purpose, are labor
ing under a delusion. In addition
they have greatly Increased the cost
of the administration of onr govern
ment. "Secondly, the democratic pRrtv
has I con false to Its pledges and
prciiil-i'S. They have failed to make
good on a slimle promt..
"In the third place Ihey have low
ered the standard of American patri
otism, they have proved themselves
Incompetent to nmnace the Internati
onal affairs of our country with otlur
nations nnd as r result have earned
the enmity nnd contempt of the civi
lised world for us."
Senator Fulton predicted a terrible
state of affairs following the end of
the European war should the demo
cratic party he returned to power this
fall. The nation with the democratic
tariff policy will then either he forc
ed to lower our standard of living
and meet the competition of the for
eign nations or else vote the repub
lican ticket nnd secure ngnln the pro.
toetlve tariff policy.
, Fulton declared that war with all
of Its etrocltles nnd Its terrors Is a
thousand times better than "peace
without honor."

SUIT IS STARTED
That the brakeman on the train
under which John Milton Morgan met
his death near Milton last July, in
stead of kicking the boy off the train,
was actually trying to assist him and
himself nearly met death at the same
time was the opening statement this
afierniwn of Attorney Riley, chief
counsel for the O-W. R. & N. which
is being sued by Mrs. Bledsoe, the
boy's mother, for $10,500 damages.
The plaintiff will by witnesses un
dertake to show that the brakeman
forcibly ejected the youth from the
train, causing him to fall under the
wheels. The defendant will contend
that one of the iron steps of the train
came loose nnd precipitated the brake
man to the ground as wt 11 as the boy.
Mrs. Bledsoe is asking for $7500
damages as administratrix for the es
tate nnd for $3000 which she alleges
he would have earned until he reach
ed his mnlority. She is being repre
"ented bv Arthur Clark of Cnrvnllia

GERMAN NOTE
ON LUSITAN1A

Indicated That Lost tarda Case Will

WASHINGTON. Oct. 18. Acting
Secretary of State Pojk announced
that the last German Lusltanla me
morandum was accepted. It propos
ed certain settlement terms.
Polk denied the published reports
that the memorandum had been ac
cepted. These reports stated that
Germany reiterated that the torpedo

the American casualties were unjusti
fiable expressed regret and promis
ed financial reparation.
"The note was not accepted. I will
not make It public. The stories of its
acceptance were printed for partisan
purposes. The state department will
not enter a discussion at this time."
Officials considered the publication
a political move, to embarras the de
partment. It Is believed foreign in
fluences are seeking to take advant

Indtcnted the Lusltanla case will re

ATHENS, Oct 13. Venlzellst lead
era have decided to ask the allies to
formally recognize the new provis
ional government established at Sa
lonika, favoring the Greek war par
ticipation. They reached the decision
after two days of serious mob dis
turbances at Athens. Th mobs
threatened to attack the allied ma
rines. They will also ask the United State
to recognize the government. They
plan to ask Washington to permit
Greek recruiting agents to operate In
America and will send recruiters to
America, Egypt, Cyprus and Paris.
French marines are occupying the
municipal theater, an abandoned
building and are encamped at the
Zeaphaleon Gardens near the royal
palace. Greek troops are patrolling
the streets, guarding the palace. The
situation Is most tense.
Anti-Any Readers at Work.
Anti-ally leaders are working
among the crowds, denouncing tbe
allies for sehnng Greek warships and
are attempting to causa a new dem
onstration against the allies.
The allies detained twenty-fly car
of ammunition at Veto. Theasaly.
They suspected the ammunition was
being sent to the central power.
Athens Is virtually under martial
law. Many alarming rumors were
circulated but cooler heads ar at
tempting to prevent street fighting.
King Has Not Fled.
Greek officials denied the reports
that King Constantine had fled and
declared the king returned to Tatol
palace Monday night after reviewing
the Greek marines and attending the
cabinet council.
The mob demonstrated outside th
British legation. One shouted:
"Down with England." Legation
guards seized him.
HUGHES WORKERS
STAGE APARADE
Supporters of Charles Evans
Hughes for president last evening pa
raded through the streets of Pendle
ton behind the Round-Up band by
way of advertising the meeting at
which ex-Senator C. W. Fulton later
spoke. The first section of the pa
rade was comprised of 20 or 30 au
tomobiles, decorated with flags and
penants, and these were followed by
foot marchers. It was not a long pa
rade or one marked by any distin
guishing features but it was the first
attempt of the campaign to line up
the workers for a candidate. Yes
terday had been designated by the
republicans as "Hughes Day" but
aside from the parade and the speak
ing there was no demonstration. The
effort to bedeck the town In flags
met with but little response.
