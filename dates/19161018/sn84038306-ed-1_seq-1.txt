H. A. GRANGER IS
GRANTED RELEASE
MERCHANT AND BANKER OF
MANCHESTER FOR NEARLY
FORTY YEARS.
FUNERAL SERVICES HELD SUNDAY
Deceased Was Native of Vermont—
Came to Volga City
in Year 1870.
After a wearisome illness, marked
with intense Buffering much of the
time, H. A. Granger passed away at
Strawberry Point early Friday morn
ing, October 13th, 1916. It was near
ly two years ago, while living at Jack
sonville, Florida, that Mr. Granger was
taken ill. During nearly all of the
time since he was confined to his bed.
Early last spring Mr. and Mrs. Gran
ger came to Manchester to spend the
Bummer months, hoping that the
change would be beneficial. For a
time during the summer a marked im
provement was noted in his condition,
but this was only temporary. The
last few weeks of his life were full
of intense suffering, death coming as
a gracious release from it all.
The remains were brought to the
home of his daughter, Mrs. M. J.
Voran, and funeral services were held
in the Congregational church on Sun
day afternoon at 2:30. Rev. W. J.
Suckow conducted the services. Inter
ment was 'made in Oakland cemetery.
H. A. Granger was born at West
Milton, Vermont, January 20th, 1841.
His early life was spent in his native
state, and in 1870 he came to Iowa,
locating at Volga City, where he re-
Miss Isabel Bremner, of this city.
The marriage ceremony was perform
ed in the First Congregational church
by the Rev. E. R, Stiles, then the pas
tor. Sdon after their marriage, Mr.
and Mrs. Granger came to Manchester
to make their home. Mr. Granger was
engaged in the grocery business here
for nearly twenty years. Retiring from
the mercantile business, he engaged
in banking, serving the First National
Banlt in the capacity of cashier for
many years. About six years ago Mr.
Granger severed his relations with
the Manchester bank and went to
Jacksonville, Florida, in the hope that
I the milder climate would be beneficial
to his health. For four years he was
I associated with the First National
Bank of Jacksonville.
For almost forty years Mr. Granger
was actively associated with the busi
ness interests of Manchester, and by
dealing fairly with his fellowmen he
established himself in their confi
dence, and won a large circle of
friends who will miss him. He united
with the First Congregational church
in 1871, and for many years took an
active part in the work of the organ
ization.
Mr. Granger is survived by his wife,
with whom he lived happily for forty
six years, and who cared for him so
tenderly during the long period of his
illness and by one son, Alson Gran
ger, of Lakeland, Florida, and daugh
ter. Mrs. M. J. Yoran, of Manchester
and three grand-daughters, Helen, Mar
yaret and Dorothy Yoran. and sister,
Mrs. A. H. Blake, of Manchester, and
one brother, George Granger, who re
sides on the old homestead in Ver
mont. One son, William Howard, died
in early childhood.
The Democrat offers its profound
sympathy to Mrs. Granger and her
family in this hour of sorrow.
A SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTE.
One of the most successful teach
ers' institutes ever held in Delaware
county was held here last Thursday
and Friday. Of the 192 teachers em
ployed in the city and rural schools
of the county only six failed to at
tend. Three of the teachers not in
attendance were in quarantine, and
the other three teachers failed to send
an excuse.
The addresses given by the instruc
tors proved of real value to the teach
ers, and every one present was great
ly benefitted as a result of the meet
ing.
Much of the credit for the very suc
cessful meeting is due to Cecil Dut
ton, the very efficient deputy super
intendent.
PHYLLIS BARR.
Miss Phyllis Barr, who resided In
Manchester until 191o, died very sud
denly at St. Charles, Minnesota, Octo
ber 3rd. 1916. Miss Barr was born at
St. Charles, and was in her forty-first
year at the time of her death. For
many years she eared for her aunt,
the late Mrs. Hatch. Miss Barr was
a sweet-spirited woman and did her
part to help those in need or distress.
She was a member of the Congrega
tional church of this city, and took
an active part in the work of the
church during the years she resided
in Manchester.
