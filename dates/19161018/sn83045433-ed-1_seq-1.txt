HECKLER STIRS
IRE OF HUGHES
"Did Not Compromise," Re
ply to Invisible Rule Taunt.
(By the laternational News Service.
Sioux City, Iowa. Ut 17.-Aroused by
alternate cheers and heckling at a big
demonstration here tonight, Charles E.
Hughes made this answer to President
Wilson's charge that he stands sponsor
for invisible government:
"In the first place, during my gover
norship at Alhany, there was no barter of
appointments for legislation.
"In the second place, legislation was
considered upon its merits in the open.
There was no semblance of inyisible gov
ernment.
"We did not buy our way through the
legislature. We did not compromise with
people. We went straight to the people
of the State and the people sustained our
policies and they were enacted into law."
Hughes paced the platform In agitation,
a he shot his words out. punctuating
each phrase nith a blow with his clench
ed fist.
In the midst of his address came the
heckling from a moan in the gallery. As
Hughes declared the Republican jarty
was "truly a party of correction and a
tarty of honorable progress,' a voice I
cried out:
"Through compulsion of organized'
labor."
Hughes darted to the front of the plat
form. 'I'm blad you said tht.'- he shout
ed. "I- i lad of t.e pportnity."1
hen cotmparative quiet was restored.
lhe rI t, the audience a tribute paid
himt 1 .i labor organ when he went upon
the bench.
TI h- tier was upon his feet again.
Tumult broke loose. Half a dozen zealous
Repuiicarns moved toward the man.
Hughes besought the crowd to ''lt the
gentI nian ask his quertion."
iltimately the heckler, using his stick
to force home his question, demanded.
ironically: "According to that, you mian
labor has taken you from Tie bench to
make you its standard-bearer '
"I am here. not as the standard-bearer
of any gr-up . et of mien in tie triliel
States, but desirous of serving to the
best of imy abI tN the awhole peop!e og
the United States."
The heckling was renewed from a fresh
quarter when Hiughes opened his attack
on the Adamson act.
"If I am elected. I will follow the prin
Piple that I now state, of racertaining
the exact facts and what justice would
dictate ought to be done at that time'
replied Hughes.
