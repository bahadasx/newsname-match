CROWD EXPECTED HERE
FOR CELEBRATION.

With the finishing touches to the
fair grounds, the final meeting of the
officials scheduled for tonight and ex
hibits and entries pouring in from all
over the country, the Xorthern Ari
zona Fair, to be held the last three
days of this week, promises to be the
most successful undertaking of its
kind that has ever been attempted by
the citizens of this city. The low
ratcs on the railroads and the perfect
condition of the roads arc expected
to attract the largest crowd that has
ever attended a local fair.
The decoration of the streets and
fair grounds will be commenced to
day and it is the earnest wish of the
committee that all of the merchants
assist as much as possible by making
their windows attractive. The official
fair colors are purple and gold and
these colors will predominate at the
fair grounds.
Under the auspices of the Grand
Lodge of the Free and Accepted Ma
sons of Arizona, Judge F. W. Perkins,
officiating, the laying of the corner
stone of the new court house will be
held Thursday morning at 10 o'clock
and will mark the opening of the fair.
Masons from all over the county will
be in attendance at this ceremony.
One of the features of the fair will
be Rcdewill's 20-picce band from
Phoenix. This band is known through
out the State and is classed as one of
the best in the country.
For the first time in the history of
the fair the Santa Fc railroad will
have an exhibit on the-grounds. This
will be under the supervision of W.
H. Hoover and all matters pertaining
to transportation will be explained at
the booth. It will also serve as a
rest room.
Representatives of the various de
partments will be in the Chamber of
Commerce during the last two days
before the opening of the fair and up
until noon Thursday, for the purpose

VERSY, DECLARES UNDER
SECRETARY AT BERLIN.
BERLIN. Oct. 16. Xorway, Hoi
land and Spain arc now playing the
leading parts in Germany s interna
tional submarine problem, to the sub
ordination of the United States, which
so lontr and so often has held the
center of the stage.
The Associated Press correspond
cut discussed the present situation to
day with Dr. Alfred Ziimnerman, un
der secretary for foreign attairs, who
indicated that the tables had been
cleared and that no negotiations were
in progress as far as the United States
was concerned. He outlined develop
ments regarding other neutrals.
The case of Holland is simplcst.jt
concerns only the liloomcrsdijK,
which was sunk off the Xcw England
coast by the German submarine L-o3.
Germany is unwilling to accept the
cabled version of the circumstances
under which the Bloomcrsdijk sunk
and is convinced the submarine com
mander must have kept within the
German prize regulations as strictly
enjoined. Full compensation has
been offered in event the commander
exceeded his instructions.
Spain's grievances have to do with
the sinking of fruit steamers. Strictly
speaking, these are valid prizes, be
cause the cargo is contraband bound
for hostile ports. The Spanish gov
ernment, however, has pointed out
that the prosperity of the countrv.
and particularly of the great class of
small fruit raisers, has been affected
seriously by interruptions of this
trade, and Germany has offered to let
such ships pass unmolested if they
arc provided with proper certificates
from German consuls and if the En
tente Allies permit similar cargoes,
ship for ship ,to pass for the German
market.
Xo reply has been received.
The Norwegian measures barring
submarines from Xorwegian waters,
in accordance with the British mem
orandum, is regarded as incompatible
with Xorwegian neutrality. Xo ex
haustive report on the legal aspects
of the question has as yet reached Dr.
Zimmerman's hands, but the under
sccrctarv said the matter undoubtcd-
would be the subject of a strong
protest to Xorway.
Dr. Zimmerman spoke with high
satisfaction of the terms of America's
reply to the memorandum of the En
tente Allies on the treatment of sub
marines. He declared it was marked
by a true spirit of neutrality.
The appearance and activity of a
German submarine off the American
coast had not been made the subject
of diplomatic negotiations or com
plications, he continued, and all re
ports indicated that the German com
mander had observed in every way
the letter and spirit of Germany's un
dertakings with the United States.

gates to the international irrigation

al reclamation act of 1902 were not
due to ignorance but were the result
of a compromise with "pork barret

fluence of "pork barrel" policy upon
the farm unit plan as insidious and
one which allowed the farm unit to be
left so large it became a handicap to
the farmer in making payments and
needed improvements.
He said the reclamation service will
be unable to consider new projects
for some years unless the reclamation
fund is replenished or other means of
financing the projects arc devised.

10 ASSAOLT
A WOMAN
MOB HANGS AND BURNS 2
MEN CHARGED WITH
ATTACKING WIFE OF
RAILROAD EMPLOYE.
By Associated Press.
PADUCAH, Ky., Oct. 16. The au
thorities arc prepared for further
trouble tonight following the lynching
and burning of two negroes today.
The saloons were ordered to remain
closed and extra peace officers depu
tized. It is feared that the summary ex
ecution of the negroes, one of whom
was charged with attacking the wife
of a railroad employe, and the other
alleged to have lauded the act, might
whet the lust for blood among the
railroad employes and associates of
the woman's husband.
Followed by a crowd, estimated at
6,000 persons, a large part of them in
automobiles, the negroes were taken
to the home of the woman, about two
miles away.
While one of them was presented
to her for identification, the other
was taken to a tree, a rope thrown
over a limb, his neck encircles in a
noose and an automobile hitched to
the other end.
As soon as the other negro had been
identified as the assailant of the wom
an, he was led to the same tree and
the process repeated.
After assuring themselves that both
negroes were dead, the members of
the mob lowered the bodies and burn
ed them on a blazing pile of brush.
The lynchings came after five hours
of labor to enter the cells in the jail
and were the outcome of an attack
made Friday upon Mrs. George Rose
at her home in the suburbs.
Tho mob gathertil aout 7 o'clock
today after hearing that the police
had arrested Brack Finley, a negro
about 35 years old, who answered to
the description of Mrs. Rose's assail
ant. The mob demanded the prisoner
and brushed aside the police reserves
j who had been sent to the scene. They
battered down the jail door but found
that the prisoners had been locked in
steel cells.
Failing to find the keys, they sent
for a foundryman to cut the bars to
I Finley 's cell. Shortly before noon, he
i had made an opening sufficient to en
able the negro to emerge. The march
to Mrs. Rose's home was begun and,
on the way, Asa Thornhill, about 20
years old, who, it had been reported,
' had lauded Finley 's attack, was seized.
! The cavalcade, when it reached the
Rose home had grown to several
thousand.
While Finley was being identified,
the leaders of the mob resolved to
hang Thornhill. Pleading for his life
the boy was bound and executed. In
i a tew minutes it was announced that
j Mrs. Rose had satisfied herself of the
(identity of Finley. He was hanged to
the same tree and a number of shots
I fired into his body.
I Quietly the mob gathered a quan
tity of wood, built a fire and placed
the bodies of both negroes upon it.
I The mob and spectators then dis
persed. WASHIXGTOX, Oct. 16. The Su
preme court toda; refused to review
the convictions of four labor leaders
" - .. ..-
