(Voter who are seeking for infor--nation
on the proposed municipal
- bond issue should read the news be
low and "let it soak in." The case in
favor of the Issuance of bonds la for
the- first time given detailed and strong
presentation..
-Who wants to block the way?"
This was the straightforward ques
tion put before the Ad Club at its
weekly luncheon today, and Supervisor
F. M. Hatch put it The query was
., put on the subject of the pending city
bond Issue, and the club lunch was de-.
voted almost entirely to discussion of
this plan of municipal financing.
Supervisor Hatch put the question
wfcen he was two hours out of Hono
lulu, steamer-bound for San Francisco,
-but he left behind him paper, so full
of "meat" that it was greeted with j
prolonged applause when read to the
" Ad Club members.
Supervisors Arnold, Logan and Hor
ner spoke, Logan at some Length,
' favoring the city's proposals for bonds.
A. F. Clark, chairman of the- road
committee, spoke briefly, advocating
. bonds for Bewers and waterworks im
provement
The club found the discussion so
" interesting it voted to hold notner
luncheon meeting on Friday, when the
bond talks will be confTnued.
City Treasurer ' Conkling opposed
the bond issue on the ground that it
piles up too large a debt and that the
territory, should .share a. Urge-expected
baiance"Ua'the 'City
Judge 'Thomas of Santa Ana,
Orange Countr. Cal.. who was a
guest at the lunch; contributed a fea
ture the members appreciated when
he said that his county put. up $1,500.-
COO for good roads recently, built 300
- miles of road, and the people consider
It about the best investment they ever
: made. . :'y ....
Ed Towse, speaking aglnst the en
tire bond issue plan, said in brief
that he had boiled the issue down to
the bonds for roads and sewers, which
he believed should- pass. He then
went Into figures to show that if the
. entire bond was passed the people
would only get $270,000 worth for an
expenditure of $480,000. When, asked
how he derived this figurCTie explain-
. ed that the interest on the bonds for
15 years amounted to $2107)00, sub
tracted from the total issue left $270,-O00.-
He said-that if the city wanted
money for the rest of the work it
should be obtained from taxes or the
: territory. '
- Supervisor Hatch's paper was as fol
lows: ; ' ' ' ,
, "At the outset and as a preliminary
observation. I desire to say; I am
not addressing those who are satisfied
with present conditions, and would do
nothing because it costs too much.
That is a perfectly logical attitude; If
there be any among us who wish to
fester over cesspools because too
stingy to pay the cost of sewers, I am
. not going to try to argue with them.
'"What should be held up to derision
is the attitude of those who are over-
flowing with criticisms of existing con
. ditions, want the best possible in
roads, water; etc., and object to pay
the price.
"Addressing you now" as men who
think that Honolulu has outgrown her
public facilities in many items and
details, and who realize that the prob-
, lem at this time is that of selecting
proper methods of procedure to fin
ance our improvements, I must say
the situation looks to me about like
V this:
"I. Ve 'are facing' grave emergen

"ll. Jn times of emergency it is
justifiable to take advantage of mod

"These are simple propositions. It
should be easy for fair-minded peo
ple -to convince themselves "of the
truth of the first and the "good logic
of the second of my texts.
Some Facts
"I. As to the fact of emergency:
"The very rapid growth of our city;
in the last 10 years has left many of
the public utilities which are essen
tial and beyonj the reach of argu

been without unhealthy, spurts, but it
has been steady. Does this club be
lieve we'have cotne'to the end of-the
growth? Criticism of past efforts to
keep the town op to its class w ill
not help us much. The thing to do is
to look the situation in the face, as it

BUT GETS CLEAR
Matson Steamer Grounds While
Between Makapuu Point and
Koko Head Early-Today
While steaming between Makapuu
Point and Koko Head about 4 o'clock
this morning nearlng this port, the
Matson steamer Lurline from 1 San
Francisco, rubbed her stern on a sub
merged jock. The shock "was felt by
several Dasseneers. who sar the
steamer grounded but cleared the ob
struction and did not come to a stop.
She arrived off port at daylight and
docked at 7:30. Officers of the steam
er made no mention of the accident
this morning and such facts concern
ing it as are available were learned
from passengers. The' local agent.
Castle & Cooke, said it had not receiv
ed any report of the grounding.
According to one passenger, the lin
er grounded about 4 o'clock, with the
rays from the Makapuu Point light
house shining brightly and plainly visi
ble from the vessel. This man felt
the shock when the steamer struck
the rock. He stuck his head out of
the port hole and said he could hear
the surf breaking on the beach. There
seemed to be two distinct shocks.
Another passenger said the steam
er took two or three inches of water
from the dent made in her stern.
The Lurline moved from Pier 10 to
Pier 15 about 10:30 this morning. A
diver will be "employed to see what
damage the hull has sustained and
whether it will be necessary to put
her In drydock here for repairs.
SHINGLE, CANDIDATE
FOR SENATE, GOES TO
COAST ON BUSINESS DEAL
Robert V. Shingle, president of the
Watcrhouse Trust Company and can
didate' for senate on the Republican
ticket sailed for the coast on' the
Matsonia this morning on an import
ant business deal. -
Several rumors centered about his
flying trip. One is that he is going
on the Lanai island deal about which
there have been numerous reports;
another that it is in connection with
the disposal of property which may
be acquired by a "hui" figuring on
bidding for the Mahuka site next Sat
urday. Still another is that it is to negotiate
on behalf of local interests for the
sale of a site to mainland hotel in
terests: .
Shingle's lare vote in the recent
primary election placed him out of
danger of defeat in the general elec
tion, November 7, Republican leaders
say, and they do not fear that his ab
sence dnring the campaign will hurt
him. He expects to arrive home on
election day.

as an idle dream.
"It is an absolute lie," he declared,
"and you can put that down in black

"I intend to resign on the first of

tended for more than a year. My only
reason for not announcing It sooner
was that 'the governor asked me to
wait for a time.
"Furthermore, I did not know just

"Mr. Thayer has at various times

second, if he is. to continue in legal
