Death of Capt. Waters. W. C.
T. U. Holds Meeting. Gov.
Manning Visited John
ston.
The regular monthly meeting of
the W. C. T. ?. was held on last
Friday with Mrs. T. R. Denny and
a short devotional was conducted
previous to business. The reports of
the officers and committees showed
that all were interested in the work.
The model member contest will be
started at the next meeting and dur
ing the winter the manual will be
studied. The chief feature of the
meeting was the report from the re
cent state convention in Sumter
from which the delegates came back
all enthused. There were four from
the Johnston union and each one
took a day to tell of, this being
done by Miss Zena Payne and Mes
dames T. R. Denny, A. P. Lewis
and James White.
A. splendid chautauqua has been
in progress here during the week
and every one has greatly eujoyed
this most plausible way for good
entertainment. On Sunday afternoon
Dr. Pound, spoke in the Methodist
church on "The heroes of the Bible"
and on Sunday evening in the Bap
tist church on "The passion play."
Capt. Philomen Waters died at
his home here on last Monday and
although the end was not unexpect
ed, the news of his passing into the
great beyond brought deep sorrow
to the town for he was one of its
earliest residents and was held in
greatest respect and iove by all. He
was To' years of age and for the
past two years had been in failing
health. Capt. Waters was a noble
and uprierht christian and was a
member of the Methodist church.
His fidelity to every trust and un
faltering faith in God were charac
teristics of his life. He was a Con
federate soldier enlisting for his
country's service at first earl and
later was appointed Capt. of his
company. At the close of the war
he was married to Miss Amory
Huiet and during the past Christ
mas holidays they celebrated their
golden wedding. Their union was
blessed with S children and the
lives and character of these which
he and his faithful companion have
reared, are as a monument to him,
more lasting than stone or marble.
During the years of his early life
he was an attorney having his office
at Edgerield. He was a man of bril
liant intellect. The funeral services
were conducted on Tuesday after
noon at 8:3U o'clock in the home
by bis pastor, Rev. J. H. 'I hacker,
and later the body was laid to rest
in Mt. of Olives cemetery. Flowers
were sent with sympathy from the
Methodist church, the W. C. T. U.,
the Daughters of the Confederacy,
the New Century club and the P.
A. R. Besides the devoted widow
the children left are Mrs. Bo?rer of
Manning, Mrs. Philipps of Spring
field, Dr. John Waters of Saluda,
Miss Annie Waters of Augusta and
Mrs. B. L. Allen, P. B. Waters,
Huiet Waters and Miss Mallie Wa
ters of this place. He leaves a half
brother, Dr. Ben Perry of Augusta,
and a half sister, Mrs. Mary Hamil
ton of this place.
A good mee; 1 ig of the Y. W. A.
was held on last Sunday at the Bap
tist church. Miss Sara Norris is
president and after the devotional
an excellent program was carried
out in which several of the mem
bers took part. The auxiliary decid
ed to agaiu send a Christmas box to
the Connie Maxwell orphanage to
assist Santa Claus in making the
children happy. Last year they sent
their box to the home which con
tained the little boys and the box
W3S tilled with gifts that would
please.
On last Friday Hon. and Mrs. J.
L. Walker entertained Gov. R. I.
Manning for the day he, being here
upon invitation of the local chau
tauqua managers to make an ad
dress at the opening of the chautau
qua. After this delightful feature
had been enjoyed the remainder of

were invited to meet with the dis
tinguished guest and all enjoyed
being numbered with the party and
also the cordial hospitality of the

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Cotton Picking Almost Over.
Grain Sowing Has Begun.
Will Make Exhibit at
County Fair,
i ,
Summer lingers with ns and we
are glad to have it. Cold weather
draws us np and chaps our hands,
so they ache as though there were
fine bits of glass in them.
Guess we will have rain on the
18th., when we have a change of
the moon and the circus in Augusta,
then we will have cold weather in
earnest.
We would like to kill a hog or
too, to catch on where our old
meat gives out. But 'tis early yet
for that, o we "pinch off" a little
at a time, trying to make it hold
out, until hog killing time. Talk
ing of hog killing, and all the hay
not cut and housed, or oats, wheat,
or rye sowed. Almost the last scrap
ing of cotton is over, though. We
have had grand weather for gather
ing it, and the price ought to be
good, for so little of it has been
stained.
The farmers are rushing to get
things gathered, and grain sowed
before a long wet spell comes on.
In the cities, 'tis rush, rush, to catch
the most dimes and dollars. So it
goes, the world over.
Sunday was lovely, but very few
ont at the Hardy's service. Con
sidering the crowd, there was a
ver.v good collection taken up for
the Orphanage.
Thursday of this week the W. M.
S. will meet at Mrs. Frances Townes
and we hope to have a good collec
tion then for the Orphans.
We hope all the other churches
may send in collections, for that is
oi?? institution, and the aged minis
ters another, that deserves more aid
than any other.
The ladies of the Meriwether
Club, and members of Sweetwater
church, will be put on the club ex
hibitr at-the-farr this sta?on, and
hope to win first prize, to assist
their church funds toward repairing
the church and painting it. We
wish them every success, and hope
the men will exert every effort to
make this the finest exhibit ever
put on yet.
This being the week for the sui's
against the Georgia and Carolina
Power Co., there are several of our
men folks at Edgefield. Messrs.
Will Briggs. John Roper, P. B.
Lanham, Jack Harling, Tom Miller,
H. L. Bunch and II. F. Cooper.
The men are so scarce in our
neighborhood, we miss them when
they go off. But my! how they do
enjoy getting away from the hum
drum, every day life on the farm,
and to exchange ideas with others.
All work and no play, makes us all
dull and blue. It does us good to
mingle with our fellow creatures.
We can begin again, and while at
work, think of the many pleasant
people we have come in contact with.
It makes life worth while.
Hardy's. J
Morgan-Harling.
Another tie has been formed be
tween two very old and honored
fa nilies. We refer to the marriage
ot Miss Annie Lee Morgan aud Mr. !
J. T. Harling, which occurred inj
Augusta Sunday afternoon at the
parsonage of the First Baptist
church, the Rev. Ashby Jones, D.
?., officiating.
A merry party, consisting of Mr.
J. T. Harling, Miss Annie Lee Mor
gan, Mr. and Mrs. C. M. Melli
champ, Miss Eileen Harling, Miss
Annie Mae Culbreath, Miss Bettie
Lou Morgan, Miss Rhett Warren,
Miss Grace Thomas and Mr. Frank
Lyon, motored to Augusta Sunday
afternoon. Soon after reaching the
city the wedding party repaired to
the parsonage where the lives of two
Edgefield young people were united
until death shall part them. The
Advertiser joins the host of friends
of these popular young people in
extending sincere congratulations.
Dr. Fuller's Bereavement.
The Edgefield friends of Dr. R.
M. Fuller, of McCormick, sympa
thize with him deeply in the death
of his wife, a noble Christian wo
man, which occurred last week. In
addition to her devoted husband,
she leaves three daughters, the
youngest being but a few hours old.
Dr. Fuller is greatly beloved in
Edgefield and his friends here min
gle their tears with his.
RED OAK GROVE.
School Makes Good Beginning.
Boll Weevil Scare. Large
Acreage in Wheat and
Oats.
It was Lowell who said "Each
day the world is born anew for him
who takes it rightly"-and so
thoughtfully may each of us apply
to ourselves, never letting a time
come for us to think life a burden,
especially when blessed with good
health and strength. A mind invest
ed with self-consciousness, self-de
termination and self action are ca
pable of amazing achievements and
again I say we never know what we
can do till we have tried. With
these thoughts in our minds we are
determined to let you hear some
thing from the outcome of a Teach
er Training class in our Sunday
school at Red Oak Grove, Mr. Geo.
Bnssey as leader.
I was sick last week and I won
dered why my thoughts were so
sweet all the while and too sick to
sit up for eight or nine days but
could one be otherwise with kind
attentions at home and loving
thoughtfulness of every one. Really
sickness is not without silver rays
made thus by good neighbors who
come in with sweet, cheerful faces,
the index of their lives and too,
again helping by refreshments and
dainties so tastily prepared helps
make the sick get well and how it
makes us feel each day the .world is
born anew.
Mrs Joseph Ramsey, nee Wates,
of Florence was warmly greeted by
her friends last week. It was so
sweet to see the affection of her
school children towards her. Know
ing her nature as I do it made her
feel deeper interested than ever in
Flat Rock pupils, meaning much
more than can be imagined when
she told our present teacher, Miss
McAfee, "You have a school of
godchildren."
Uur school opened last Monday
with thirty-odd pupils. The entire
enrollment will be about forty-six.
And for one teacher to be expected
to do justice to that number is ab
surd, impossible, so now good peo
ple of Flat Rock get busy and get
assistance. The children are all de
lighted with and love Miss McAfee
and we feel quite sure she is the
right teacher for us. But we know
she'does need help and want her to
have it. She is entitled to it in jus
tice to ourselves.
Our farmers have new thoughts
coming since hearing the boll wee
vil at M od oe. Mr. Charlie Stone
sent specimen to Clemson college
which was pronounced the weevil.
We should look with interest for
what Gov. Manning may instruct
for our state.
We hear of a number sowing
larger than usual of wheat, oats
and rye. We think the gardens are
receiving renewed and unusual inter
est at this season of the year and
let us keep cool, don't get scared.
People are not capable of handling
anything intelligently, and times
are worse with the whole world we
may say in an upheaval, which calls
forintelligent,steady nerves. If worse
seems to face us let's live one day
at a time and that day the very best
we can, knowing that''lle who is for
us is mightier than they who are
against us."

The School Parade.
The county fair is a county-wide
enterprise and the citizens of every
section of the county should take an
active interest in it, feeling that it
is their fair. An opportunity will be
offered Friday, the third dav of the
fair, for every community to par
ticipate. A parade of school wagons
has been planned and handsome
prizes offered. There should be at
least 25 or 30 decorated wagons in !
the parade. One of the very best
features of a former fair was the
school wagon parade. Let's all cora- J
hine our efforts and make the school
wagon parade the best part of this I
fair. It can be easily done, if the pa
trons aud trustees of the schools
will co-operate with the teachers in
having the schools represented.
County Superintendent of Educa
tion W. W. Fuller heartily en
dorses the holding of the school
wagon parade and has written to
the teachers urging them to have
their school participate in the pa
rade. Have your school represented
and win one of the prizes.

The hostess served a very dainty
salad course with coffee, and the
meeting closed just in time to allow
the Trenton ladies to reach their
homes before the evening shadows
fell, but the visitors were overtaken
by darkness, and moonlight aud star
light guarded them to their desti
nation, until the electric lights of
our fair city sent their magic beams
to illumine their way.

HISTORIC PAPER.
Sketch of Stephen Tompkins.
Prepared by Mrs. Maggie
Hill Read Before Edge
field D. A. R.
The Tompkins' are of both Eng
lish and Welsh decent. Sir Plugh
Treberne, a gallant knight who was
with the Blaek Prince at Poitiers,
was the founder of the Welsh
branch of the family. In Yorkshire,
England, the name appears as Tomp
kins. Oue lost his life in hi* sov
ereign's cause. "Mr. Nathaniel
Tompkins, gentleman of Holborn,"
appears on the records. Nathaniel
Tompkins was loyal cc King Charles
1st and was tried at Guildhall June
30, 1643, and was beheaded for his
loyalty to his King. Particulars of
his trial and his speeches are preser
ved. The organist of the chapel
royal was Thomas Tompkins. This
was in 1625, and much of his manu
script is preserved in the British
Museum. William Tompkins was
an artist, and also his son Peltro,
who was portrait painter to George
III, and drawing master to the prin
cesses.
One of the first of the name in
this country, was Micah Tompkins,
who with his wife, Mary, came from
England about 1639, settling in
Wethersfield, Conn., going from
there to Milford, of which be was
one of the founders. In May 1668,
he was one of a company of eleven
to purchase from the Indians the
site upon which Newark, N. J.,
now stands. He was also one of
the committee to build Newark's
first church. Much data of this
sturdy pioneer, is preserved by the
New Jersey Historical Society.
Another pioneer father, was John
Tompkins, who also came from Eng
land.
The founder of the New York
branch of the family was Nathaniel,
who settled at Eastchester, about
-1680.--Nathaniel, it may be noted,
is a favorite family name. A branch
of the family also settled in Virgin
ia, John and his wife, Annie Tomp
kins, who was his cousin. They re
moved to Kentucky in 1794, and
left a large estate. The Rhode Is
land family descended from Nathan
iel, who married in 1671, Elizabeth
Allen. The coat-of-arrns belonging
to the Tompkins' of Sussex, Ens
land, is produced on azure parch
ment, consisting of a chevron be
tween three Moorcock's, and as
many crosses. The crest being a
ship under full sail.
Of the two families who came to
Virginia about 1740, one was Cap
tain Stephen Tompkins, the pater
nal ancestor of the family in South
Carolina. He went from Virginia
lo Anson county, North Carolina,
where he met and married "Puggy"
Franklin, a paternal cousin of the
famous Benjamin Franklin, and it
is said that she possessed as strong
mental endowments as her after
wards famous kinsman. If she ever
had any other name than Puggy,"
it was never heard of by her de
scendants.
Stephen Tompkins was born in
New York, May 9th 1730. He was
tall and slender, and of rather strik
ing personality. Stephen Tomp
kins, having moved to Anson coun
ty. North Carolina, before the out
break of the Revolution of 1776.
raised a company ef cavalry, which
he commanded during the war. It
was related by him that the best
soldier he had in his command was
one Le had himself shot for stealing
his horses. The horses of his troop
began to disappear and he su.>pected
some of his own men of this breach
of law as well as of military discip
line. Ile did not trust a detail to
watch for the thief, but did it in
person, and soon discovered a there
tofore Tory leading a horse from
where they were parked as if carry
ing him to water. Ile did not. hail,
but fired the contents of a blunder
buss in the region of the horse
thief's pedal extremities. He recov
ered the horse, and sending the
wounded thief to his home, improv
ised as a hospital, with his adored
"Puggy" as the whole Red Cross
Corps, to whom the sick and wound
ed were committed, and dear Grand
ma "Puggy," not only nursed her
patient back to health, but convert
ed him from a loyal subject of King
George, to an ardent patriot in the
cause of American Liberty. Tho
convert afterwards said: "lt was
