-Who wants to block the way?"
This was the straightforward ques-.j
lion pu; bcrore the Ad Club at Its
- weekly luncheon today, and Supervisor
F. M. Hatch put It. The query was
on the subject of the pending city
l!d issue, and the'club lunch was de
Nd almost entirely to discussion of
this' plan of municipal financing. '
Supervisor Hatch put the question
when be was two hours out of Hono
lulu, steamer-bound for Sari Francisco,
but he left behind him a paper so full
of "meaf that; it was .greeted' with
prolonged applause when read to' the
Ad Club members.
Supervisors Arnold, Logan and Hor
ner spoke," Logan : at some length,
favoring the city's proposals for bonds.
A. F. CUrk, chairman of the roau
committee, spoke briefly advocating
bonda for sewers and waterworks im
provement. . , -
The club found the discussion o
Interesting 1 it voted . to hold iaiotiier
luncheon meeting on Friday, wheu the
bond talks , will be continued.. '
City Treasurer ; Conkllng opposed
the bond Issue on the ground that it
"piles up too .large a.debt and that the
territory should ehare a. large' expect-
ved balance with the city '.
Judge . Thcuias " of Santa .- Ana;
Orange County, Cal who was' a
guest at the lunch, contributed a fea
ture the members appreciated when
be said that his county put up $1,500.
COO for good roads recently, built 300
miles of road, and the people consider
It about the best investment they ever
made.-"'"' ,' .' -
Ed. Towse.. speaking aglnst the en
thre bond issue plan, said in brief
that he had boiled the issue down to
the bonds for. roads and sewers, which
he believed should pass. :;" He then
; went into figures "to show that if the
entire bond waa . passed" the people
mvouM only get $170,000 worth for an
i expti!ture of $4.50,000. "When asked
t ho'vle derived this flgurffne explaln
edlwrt the interest on the.bonda for
15 years amounted to $210)00, sub
tracted froia the total issue left 1270,-'
v O00. He aald that if the city wanted
money for the rest of the work it
should be obtained from taxes pr the
territory. . . ; 1
! Supervisor Hatch's paper was as fol
' - lows: - " " - ' . '
At tho outset and as a preliminary
observation, 1 desire to-, say: I am
: not addressing those who are satisfied
with present conditions, and would do
nothing because it costs too. much.
That Is a perfectly logical attitude: If
there be any among us who wish to
fester over cesspools " because too
- stingy to pay the cost of sewers, I am
not going to try to argue with them.
What should be held up to derision
is the attitude of those who are ovcr
' flowing with criticisms of existing con
ditions, want the best possible in
nuads, water, etc, and object to pay
the price.
"Addressing you now as men who
think that Honolulu has Outgrown bcr
, public facilities in' many Items and
details, and who realize that the prob
Jem at this time is. that of selecting
proper methods of procedure to fin
ance our improvements, I must say
the situation looks to me about like
;, this: .. . . : .
"I. A'e are facing grave emergen
: cies: .
. "II. In times of emergency it i Is
justifiable to take advantage of mod
em jnethods of financing improve
vayi: In fact all methods available
( fse are simple propositions. It
stVaid be easy for fair-minded peo
ple to convince themselves of the
truth of the first and- the good -logic
of the second of my texts.
Some Facta
- As to the fact of emergency: .
"The very rapid growth of our city
in the last 10 years has left many of
1 the public utilities which are essen
tial" and beyond the reach of argu
ment, in the rear. The growth has
- been without unhealthy spurts, but it
has been steady. Does this club te--lieve
we have come to the end of the
growth?- Criticism of past efforts to
keep the town up to its class will
' not .help us much. The thing to do Is
to look the situation in the face as it
Is today. - "
Ml. How great la the emergency?

'. While steaming ' between Makapuu
Point and Koko Head about 4 o'clock
this - mofnlng nearrngMg'pW-the
Matson steamer Lurllne from, San
Francisco, rubbed her stern on a sub
merged rock. The shock was felt by
several passengers, . who say the
steamer grounded but cleared the ob
struction and did not come to a stop.
She arrived off port at daylight and
docked at 7:30. Officers of the fsteam
er made no mention of the accident
this morning and such facts concern
ing It. as are available were learned
from passengers. The local agent.
Castle & Cooke, eald it had not receiv
ed any report of the grounding. : '
According to one passenger, the lin
er grounded about 4 o'clock, with the
rajs from the Makapuu Point light
house shining brightly and plainly, visi
ble from the vessel. This man felt
the shock when the steamer struck
the rock. He stuck his head out of
the port hole and said he could hear
the surf breaking on the beach. There
seemed to be two distinct shocks.
Another passenger said the steam
er took two or three Inches of water
from the dent made In her stern.
The Lurllne moved from Pier 10 to
Pier 15 about 10:30 this morning. A
diver, will be employed to see what
damage the hull has sustained and
whether it wllKte . necessary to put
her in drydock here for repairs.

Not Yet Considered
"Such stuff as dreams are made of,"
Is the manner in which territorial of
ficials at the capitol today classify a
report printed in a morning paper to
the effect that a "plan" has been ar
ranged whereby Dr. J. Jl. Raymond,
present, candidate for senator from
Maui, is to be appointed to the office
of secretary of the territory if defeat
ed In the present campaign.
. Governor jpinkhara went even far
ther than to classify the "plan" story
as an Idle dream. .
"It la an absolute lie," he declared.
'and you can put that down In black
letters if you want to. The territorial
secretary is appointed by the presi
dent through the Secretary of the In
terior. I have; not even taken into
consideration my names for recom
mendation to the president." ;
Secretary Thayer, today authorized
the Star-Bulletin to publish .the state
ment that he Intends to resign on Jan
uary .1.- ' ' . --' t :
"I intend to resign on the. first of
the year,". he said, "and have so in
tended for more than a year. My only
reason for not: announcing it sooner
was, that the governor asked me to
wait for a time.. .

when I should send in my resignation

and undoubtedly t' should, be informed
of if ff - uch a thing , were being
'planned.'."
Governor Finv nam saia toaay:
Mrv Thaver has at various times
intimated that he might resign from
office for two reasons: First, that of
fice is not overcrowded with work, and
second, if he is to continue In legal
practise he felt that It required more
attention and wider scodb than the of
fice consultation that he had main
tained with his former clients. -.
"Recently he has emphasized Jhls
latter noint of view, but has "not taken
absolute steps necessary to the lib
erty he feels his prore6sion requires,
it la at hi nnMon to do what he be-
lives best for his. personal Interests."
At 2 o'clock this morning the body
of Miss Effie Crichton was found on
Walkikl Beach, between the outrigger
anil thft Majioa' Dre'mises. A post
mortem examination was made by Po
lice Surgeon. TL G. Ayer and w.uu
Patterson, who report drowning as
the cause of her death. :
Miss Crichton's only relative in
Honolulu is Mrs. John Lind of Moana
lua. 'j She camo here, about five years
ago, from Vancouver, had been em-
nlnveri In various homes as a eovern-
ess for children and -had Intended to
return soon to her home in Scotland.
The funeral was to be at Williams'
undertaking parlors at 3 o'clock this
afternoon and burial will be In the
Nuuanu cemetery.
The 'tragedy was first discovered
when Miss Crichton's clothes were
found about 6:30 last night by the at
tendant in the Moana ' Hotel - balh
house when he started to close up for
the night After waiting seme time
for her appearance he notified -me
hotel management and an alarm was
sent to the police.':
Deputy Sheriff Asch, Chief McDuf
fie and Detectives Stein, Apana and
Kellett went to the beach and dragged
the bottom, played searchlights on the
wares and went out In canoes with
no success for about three hours. The
darkness was intense and apparently
the body was under the water. This
morning the discovery was made by
a hotel watchman oing the rounds
ot the beach.
Friends of Miss Crichton have ad
vanced as a cause of her drowning
the fact that she sustained a dislo-.
cated shoulder some time , ago while
in charge of te Harold K. Castle
children and that possibly she had
dislocated it in some way in the
water and .fainted through pain. Dr.
Ayer says, however, that there Is no
indication of this. The first disloca
tion of the same ' shoulder occurred
when Miss Crichton slipped and Tell

' . Topics for Discussion
: By.Candidates V .
Woman suffrage is to be made a
live issue in the campaign of the. Re
publican candidates ; which will pre
cede the general election on Novem
ber 7 and which will be opened with
a rally at Aala Park at 7.: 30 o'clock
next Saturday evening.
A report to this effect was issued
from Republican headquarters today,
r-.nd at a meeting of the advisory com
mittee with the candidates tomorrow
evening, it is probable that several of
the candidates will be assigned to ex
plain the woman suffrage plank to the
voters during the campaign talk-fests.
The plank , in the local G. O. P.
platform dealing with woman' suffrage
is as follows: , '
"Believing that the continued dis
franchisement of women is a relic of
antiquity that belongs to other days
and that" women never have maintain
ed and never will maintain their mo
ral, natural or legal rights save by
ihe possession of political rights, we
favor the enactment of laws granting
equal suffrage to them. As this is a
kubject which the territory itself
should be permitted to legislate, we
ftvor the submission to Congress of
a: memorial for an amendment to the
organic act by , which the legislature
of the territory may have power to
act or may, should such a course seem
advisable, call a special election for-a
submission of the. question to the
vcters." ' :
At the meeting tomorrow, the final
arrangements for the campaign will be
made and various other topics will be
assigned to the candidates, including
an explanation; of the frontage-. tax
system. . ".' ' .

Robert W. Shingle, president of the

ticket, sailed fot the coast on the
Matsonia this morning on an Import
ant business deal. . :
- Several rumors centered about his
flying trip. One is that he, is going
oh the Lanai island deal about .whicn
there have been numerous" reports;
another that it is in connection with
the disposal of property which may

bidding for the Mahuka site next Sat
urday. "
Still another is that it is to negotiate
on behalf of local interests for the
sale ot a TBite to mainland hotel in
terests. ' .
Shingle's lare vote in the: recent
primary election placed him out of
danger of defeat in the general elec
tion, November 7, Republican leaders
say, and they do not fear that hia ab
sence during the campaign will hurt
him. He expects to arrive home on
