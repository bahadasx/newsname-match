House of Deputies of Protest
, ant , Episcopal Church
Trims Up Forms
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 13. With the im
portant prayer changes concurred in by
the house of deputies of the Protestant
Kpiscopnl, church, the joint session of
the deputies and the house bishops took
up the question of missions today.
There was comment on the possibilty
of a debate on the question of unction.
The so-eallcd "Catholic" wins of the
conference is expected to' bring the
question beforo the house, if further
nction is taken in revision of prayers.
The "unctionlsts" aro hopeful, despite
the fact that the join t. commission on
common prayer .refused to .make, any
recommendation for an "office for the
nnnointing of the sick."
Members of tho joint commission on
common prayer today said there might
he further debate on some of the pray
ers now used by the church. The adop
tion of the prayer I,' asking the health
of the president of the Tinted States
and all iu authority" and asking "the
tafety and preservation of the nation"
enme Into yesterday. The omission of
the words "the governor of this state"
from the evening prayer also caused con
siderable debate, but tho commission re
port to omit the words finally .teas
adopted.-
Changes In Commandments.
The report of the joint commission on
the revision of. commandments which
recommends the shortening of the Ten
Commandments is yet to come before
the deputies for consideration. In its
present position on the caleudar of the
'liouse it is likely to eome up for debate
late today or tomorrow. The report pro
poses the following changes from the
("resent commandments, if the report
is adopted the commandments will read:
1 No change from present.
2 Thou shalt not make unto thyself
any graven image nor the likeness of
anything that is iu heaven above or in
the earth beneath or in the water under
lie earth; thou shalt not bow down to
ttiom nor worship them.
3 Thou ehalt not take the name of
-the Lord thy God in vain.
A Itemember that thou keep holy the
Sabbath day.
5 Honor thy fnther and thy mother.
(1 No change from the present.
7 Nonhango.
8 No change.
1 Thou shalt not bear false witness.
10 Thou shalt not covet anything
tliat is thy neighbors.
The proposed form eliminates words
of explanation or nrgument for their
observance. This is the part which it is
proposed to eliminate because they are
'used in the litany of the church, which
forms one of the most important parts
of the Protestant Kpiscopul prayerbook.

to Workers
Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. IS. Los Au
geles wag all aflutter today over the
reception to be tendered the women
r.bonrd the special train bearing fair
crusaders about the nation, who nre
pleading for Hughes votes.
Two receptions have been planned.
Ono by republican women the other by
'fair democrats. The latter aro in turn
sub-divided as to their mode of recep
tion. Some have planned au austere dig
nified protest, while an equal number
inclined to the more militant, favor a
repetition of the heckling party accord
ed tho Hughesites at Portland.
So fearful nre the Hughes supporters
in this city that there may be a disturb
ance that Mrs. Charles A". Gibson, vice
chairman of the National Hughes Al
liance for California, applied to Chief
Butler for protection. .
A detail of police will also escort Mrs.
Raymond Robins, who is to address
workers at the Baker Iron Works.
At 10 a. m. Wilson supporters gath
ered for the reception.
Women who are aboard the womeu's
Hughes campaign train will be escorted
to the Alexandria hotel, after a parade
of "the downtown streets in which more
than 100 autos will participate.
The parade is to be followed by a
luncheon at the Alexandria. The speak
ers will include Mrs. Maude Howe El
liott, Mrs. William C. Demorest and Mrs.
Frank Mehnne, nil prominent members
ot the republican partv from New York.
At 3 o'clock a mass meeting at Trin
try auditorium is scheduled. Addresses
will be made by local woineu republican
leaders and visitors.
Submarines Will Not
Get Much Information
Washington, Oct. 18. If. any more
German submarines put in to American
harbors this government will guard
against transmission of unneutral in
formation to them.
This clearly indicated today from
the activities of neutrality experts at
Newport, probing the 'talks of civilian
visitors n board th l'-5;l iu her recent
stay there. The British suggestion that
valuable information may have beea
given the German vessel is having
weight.
Officials generally, however, do not
look for genuine complications with
England, despite the serious discussion
of the matter yesterday by Foreign
Secretary Grey in the house of lords.
Grey's talk, pointed to as full of in
timations, rather than direct charges or
protests, was thought by some authori
ties here to have been in the nature of
an offset to-American protests against
British interference with mails.
After 20 years of activa service. Rod

and taken care of for the rest of hit

HUGHES WILL TALK
Is Pleased with Reception at
Sioux City and Will Preach
the Tariff
By Perry Arnold.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, Oct. 18. Governor Hughes
made his second incursion into Michigan
today in the best fighting trim ho hus
enjoyed since tho republican convention
here choso him standard beurer for the
party.
There wasn't any question that the
nominee was pleased with the impreB
sion which he made on his big uudience
in Sioux -City last-night. As on prev
ious occasions during his stumping
tours, it was the heckler who started
Hughes spilling real fireworks. -
Aroused and stimulated by the way in
which his 'audience supported him and
sought to drown hecklers by booing,
Hughes "cut loose." Never before in
his presidential campaigning litis the
nominee been more earnestly emphatic,
more dramatic or forceful than when he
hurled his vitriolic denial to any charge
that he wus ossoeiuted with "invinible
government" and coupled this with a
pledge that if elecfed he would flnve
" visible" government.
Hughes arrived in Chicago shortly be
fore noon and remained on his private
car while it was being transferred from
one road to another. The candidate
slept lute on his train todpy, benig con
siderably fagged out by last night's
experience and, moreover, favored by a
schedule which did not provide any pub
lic apeparnnce for him until late this
afternoon, Hughes expected to make
the tariff and labor issues the main bur
den of his discussions in Michigun.

The south, and Liverpool were heavy

Americans Must Go Hungry
To Let Speculators Ac-,
cumulate Big Fortunes
Pasadena, Cal., Oct. 18. Declaring
that unless a large vote for socialism

race an unprecedented food shortage
and resultant high prices, Allan L.
Benson, socialist ' candidate for presi
dent, discussed the high -cost of food
problem in an interview today,
, Mr. Benson charged both republican
and democratic candidates with being
indifferent to this question.
"It is a scandal, ' said Benson,
that the people of this country, hav
ing produced an abundance of food, are
compelled to sit by while a few spec
ulators are stripping the country ot its
food and exporting."
Benson will speak in Los Angeles to

ROOSEVELT BITTER
IN ATTACKON WILSON
Fears Peoples' Moral Sense
Will Be Dulled Unless He
Guides Them
By J. P. Yoder
(United Press staff correspondent)
Aboard Roosevelt's Train, Corbin,
Ky., Oct. IS For the first time in his
western stumping tour for Governor
Hughes, Colonel Roosevelt todav gave
one of his specific reusons why the re
publican candidate should succeed
President Wilson at the White House.
"President Wilson," said Roosevelt.
"by adroit elocution has stilled the
spirit of patriotism in the tuition's
breast. Against this man of mere elo
cution, we have put in Mr. Hughes, the
mnn whose intellectual straightforward
ness; whoso, rugged strength of char
acter and whose courageous sincerity
of purpose, give us guarantee that ev
ery promise he makes, either expressed
or implied, will bo made good by his
actions."
Roosevelt's speech here was impromp
tu. "I feel," he said, "that primarily
tho great count against Mr. Wilson is
that by his substitution of words for
deeds and his betrayal of his fine words
by his deeds, he has loosed tho spring
of American put riot ism and hus dulled
the moral sense of our peoplo
"Moreover, in addition to the fact
that his deeds have made his lofty ut
terances matters of contemptous de
rision, some of his words themselves
have eaten into the minds of our peo
ple with the acid of degradation,
"A little . while ago in one- of our
largo cities a school teacher doclinod
to allow the children in his class to sing
patriotic songs. It is smnll wonder that
such should be the cuse when the chief
executive sets the kind of example that
President ilson has set.
"if the president is inspired by tho
sinking of the Lusitania with tho loss
of DUO lives only to make his remark
about being too proud to fight, it is not
to bo wondered at that some of his
friends should feel reluctant to sing
the 'Star Spangled Bunner.'
"If the president ventures to raise
his voice in protest against the treach
erous murder of Boyd and Aduir and
their troopers, those who lollow nun
are to be excused for refusing to sing
America. The election of Mr. Hughes
is the only way by which we can-now
restore the tone of the national con
science and give to our people once
more the feeling of the duty of patriot
ism."

VENIZELOS' SUPPORTER
ATTACKED AND BEATEII
Great Mob of Reservists
Gather and Shout: "Down
With the Allies"
Athens, Oct. 18. Venixelist
today decided to call upon the allies to
formally recognisse the new provisional
government set up at Salonika, favor
ing UTeoec'B intervention in the war.
lhis decision was reached after two
lays of serious disturbances in tin
Greok capital, in which the mobs threat
ened to attack allied marines. :
Two diplomatic missions were organ
ized. Thoy will present the case of the
provisional government to the allies,
declaring that only formal reeognitiaa
of this new government will save
Greece from utter chaos.
Negotiations have been begun infor
mally with the United States to permit
tho recruiting of Greek armies in Amer
ica, in the event that the United State
recognizes the new government. Re
cruiting agents will be sent to the Unit
ed States, to Egypt, Cyprus and Patris,
if the desired permission is secured.'
Athens, Oct. 18. Threatened with
attack by a huge crowd of anti-ally
demonstrators, the - French - marine
forces that occupied ' the municipal
theatre has abandoned the building
and encamped in the Zeappaucou Gar
dens, near tho royal palace.
Greek troops are still patrolling the
streets and a Greek .battalion is guard
ing the royal palace. Tho situation is
most tense. Anti-ally leaders are work
ing among tho crowds, denouncing the
allies for wising the Greek warships
and attempting to stir the mobs to new
demonstrations of hostility toward the
allies' sailors. - -
Thus far there has been no serious
clash between the allied troops and the
anti-ally crowds. Several thousand
Greeks, gathered, in the Btreets near
the squnre surrounding tho theatre,
watched the transfer of the FTcncli
marines, but there was no demonstra
tion except an ocensi nal shout.
Tho allies havo detained 25 carloads
of ammunition at Volo, in Thessuly,
which wns destined for the interior of
Thessnly. It is Buspectcd that the am
munition was being shipped to enemies
of the allied powerB.
Athens is virtuully under martial
law. All sorts of alarming rumors are
in circulation, but cool heads are at
tempting t'. prevent a claxh between
French sailors and tho civilian demon
strators that would develop into street
fighting with most serious conse
quences. Reports that King Constantino had
fled are denied by Greek officials.
They declaro tho king returned to
Tatoi palice Monday night after re

trouble began "Monday after
noon. Great crowds had gathered to
watch Orcek sailors from the .ships
taken over by the allied powers, in re
view before King Constantino. As the
parade ended and the king took hia
departure amid cheers, several shouts
of "down with Venizclos! " and "down
with the allies!" were heard. A Greek
politician, a supporter of Veniaelos,
was. recognised bv several in the crowd,
set upon and badly beaten without in
terference by the police.
Shortly afterward French marines,
landed at Piraeus on reports that riota
wero threatening, reached. the capital
and took possession of the municipal
theater. A great crowtl, formed partly
of Greek reservists swarmed about the
marines and shouted insulting remarks.
