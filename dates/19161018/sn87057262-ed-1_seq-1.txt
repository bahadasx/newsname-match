there is very little difficulty ahead of

NBW YOdCK, Oct. 18.—While an
increase in the price of foodstuffs
amounting to IS per cent picked
pockets of New Yorkers today, many
grocers predicted another 26 per cent
which will make many staple articles

blamed.
The allies are willing to pay such
high prices for food, that wholesalers

A short crop klso is playing havoc
in the prices, and Canada's participa
tion in the war is having its effect
for that British possession is sending
all its surplus to feed the great arm

munition plants is taking men from
the farms and farmers are forced to
pay higher prices to harvest their
crops. Speculators also help, boost

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct- J*.—With the
important prayer changes concurred
In by the house of deputies of the
Protestant Episcopal church, the joint
session of the deputies and the house
of bishops took up the question of
missions today.
There was comment on the possi
bility of debate on the question of
unction. The so-called "Catholic
wing" of the conference Is expected to
bring the question before the house if
further action is taken on the revision
of prayers. The "unctlonlsts" are
hopeful despite the fact the joint com
mission on common prayer refused to
make any recommendation for an "of
fice for the annointlng of the sick."
Members of the joint commission
on common prayer today saU there
might be further debate on some of
the prayers now used by the church.
The adoption of the prayer "asking
the health of the president of the
United States and all in authority"
and asking the "safety and preserva
tion of the nation," cajne late yester
day. The omission of the words "the
governor of this state" from the "ev
ening prayer also caused considerable
debate, But the commission report to
omit the words finally was sdopted.
The report of the joint commission
on the revision of commandments
which recommends the shortening of
six of the Ten Commandment^ is yet
to come before the deputies for con
sideration. In its present position on
the calendar of the house, it is likely
to come up for debate late today or

following changes from the present
commandments. If the report is
adopted, the commandments will
read:
1—No change froni present.
2—Thou shait not make unto thy
self any graven image nor the like
