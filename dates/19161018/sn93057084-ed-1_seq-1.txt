If yon want a real good joy ride
this editor advises vou to get ou
"the kears*' at Gettysburg an 1 take
a trip to Pierre. He returned
Monday evening from another visit
there, consequently he knows
whereof he speaks. Even at this
"melancholy" period of the year
there is much to make a visit worth
while and especially, you should
visit there while the Legislature
is in session. Each visit we make
we find the grounds around the
State Capitol enlarged and beauti
fied, while "Capitol Lake" sets
like a jewel in the diadem of the
Ship of State. With a minimum
of expense, it is worth while for
anyone to visit the capitol building
with its marbled columns, magnifi
cent dome, treasures of art, his
tory, literature etc, all to be seen
free of charge..
Included in our visit, was a trip
to Capa, where the hot water from
the artesian well heats up the rail
road depot, being the hottest ar
tesian water in the state. J.E. and
R.K. were all in usual health and
circumstances and Al. has got a
new renter in his hotel. Grandma
was as well as usual, considering
her age which is eight3*six
As a member of the last two
sessions of the So. Dakota Legisla
ture, F. B. Patterson, who is a
candidate for re-election, was a
"live wire," originating some val
uable legislation, which became
laws. One of these was the act
reimbursing the different school
districts for the school tax on land
owned by the State. There are
several thousand acres of this land
in Potter county, that in the Forest
City school district amounting to
5000 acres. On this account, this
district is receiving annually
not less than §196.99 to put into
her treasury, as a result of Mr.
Patterson's interest in school af
fairs. Two other districts in the
county each received, in 1916, a
still larger amount, the total sum
appropriated by the legislature for
the State, for said year, being
$15,000.00.-.4efo\
"The Great Conspiracy of the
House of Morgan Exposed" and a
practical plan to prevent its con
summation, is a new book just off
the Press, by H.L.Louek?, Water
town South Dakota.
In view of the recent legislation
changing our financial system from
Government money to that of
national bank credits, the con
fering on a small group
of men the special privilege of a
nonopoly, for private profit, of
the constitutional power to issue
and control the money of the na
tion, and to charge such rates of
interest for the use of money or
credit, as will satisfy the demands
of private monopoly, the study is
A timely one. „"y-

FOREST
Spends Two Nights and Day in
Forest City
The snagboat Mandan was a
pleasant visitor at this port again,
after a long absence, arriving here
Saturday evening and remaining
till Monday, in command of Capt
ain Charleswoith.' Near Swift
Bird camp something happened to
the machinery, so that she had to
drift down. While here repairs
and instructions were telagraphed
for, and she was ordered to report
at Pierre, which point she had to
also make by drifting. A large
number of people had the pleasure
of inspecting her, including sever
al from Gettysburg
The Sioux City Journal contains
the following Marine news:
"The Mandan will be placed
dry dock at the government harbor
on the Big Sioux riyer at North
Riverside this winter.
The snagboat McPherson com
manded by Capt. J. Fred Farris,
will take a barge up to Elk Point
and suag the river on its return
trip south to Kansas City. The
vessel will be quartered this winter
in the new government harbor
near St. Joseph. Mo.
The Elk Point made a trip down
stream to Decatur, Neb. The boat
will he quartered at North River
side this winter."
POPULAR GOVERNMENT IS OVER
THROWN IN SOUTH DAKOTA!
Shall the People Rule?
Officialdom has repealed the
Richards primary law which the
people adopted by the direct vote
in 1912, and which the people,
themselves refused to repeal by a
second vote in 1914. The 1915
legislature, nevertheless, repealed
it and also attached the emergency
clause to prevent the people from
referring this act of the legislature
to a vote.
The politicians do not want the
Richards law. They want the se
cret spoils system for the few, in
place of the open merit system for
everybody. They want the pre
sent confused ballot. They do not
want issues discussed so the people
can hear both sides before they
vote as is provided in the Richards
law.
The people have therefore again
petitioned for the Richards law
iu amended form to be voted on at
November election. Vote "YES"
and put it back to give it a fair
trial, and let officialdom know that
"Under God the People Rule" in

TWELVE REASON8 WHY
WOMEN SHOULD VOTE.
1. Eecause those who obey
the laws should help to choose
those who make the laws.
2. Because laws affect worn
en as much as men.
3. Because laws which af- 4*
feet women are now passed
without consulting them. 4
4. Because laws affecting 4*
children Include the woman's 4*
point of view as .well as the 4
man's.
5. Because laws affecting
home are voted on in every ses- 4
sion of the legislature. 4
6. Eecause women have ex
perience which would be help- 4
ful to legislation 4
7. Because to deprive worn- 4*
en of the vote
is
•i-
4.
to lower their 4*
position in common estimation. 4
8. Because having the vote 4
would increase the sense of re- 4*
sponsibility among women to- 4*
ward questions of public im- 4*
portance.
to. Because hundreds of 4*
thousands of thoughtful intelli
gent, hard-working women want 4*
the vote. 4
11. Because the objections
against their having the vote 4*
are based on prejudice, not on 4*
reason. 4*
12. Because to sum up all 4*
reasons in one—IT IS FOR 4*
THE COMMON GOOD OF ALL.

The Mysterious Nightingale.
The nightingale is the most mysteri
ous of birds. No one has yet been
aide to discover why it favors districts
and shuns others, and no one yet has
ever succeeded in inducing it to settle
'n places it dislikes. Sir John Sin
•lair, about a century ago, tried to ln
roduce it in Scotland. With this end
procured at great expense a large
"imber of nightingales' eggs, which
vere packed in wool and sent north,
liere they were put Into robin red
.•easts* nests. Their foster parents
iooked after them well, they were
hatched and flew about, and at the
usual time they migrated. But they
never returned, as birds usually do, to
tbe land of their birth.—London Mirror.
