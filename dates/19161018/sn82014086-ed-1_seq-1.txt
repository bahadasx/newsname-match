Marines From Warships of Entente Powers
CROWDS OF ROYALISTS

Clashes Between Them and the Royalists King Con
stantine Told Officers of His Fleet That He Would Stand
by Them, Regardless of Consequences Berlin and Vi
enna Claim Capture of Trenches Along a Front of Mile
and a Half in Galicia Rumanians are Holding Back
Austro-Germans in Transylvania.
With the occupation of Athens and
Piraeus by marines from the warships
of the entente powers, a tense eitua
t.on has arisen in Athens. Great
crowds of royalists have paraded the
strews of the Greek capital, cheering
the king, and cordons of Greek troops
nd marines have been thrown about
the railway stations, city hall and other
points occupied by the entente forces
bo prevent clashes between them and
the royalists. An unofficial despatch
ays Admiral Dufournet was hissed by
the throngs in the streets of Athens
and that a detachment of French sail
ors was driven back by the hostile
crowd.
Kins Constantine in a speech to the
officers of his fleet told them ho would
stand by them no matter what conse
quences might follow their loyalty to
Greece.
Volhynia, Galicia and Transylvania
are still the points where the heaviest
fighting is taking place. Along the
Homme front in France bombardments
alone have prevailed, except to the
east of Uelloy en Santerre, where the
Germans threw two attacks against
the French, only to be repulsed.

in order to prevent any crash between
Greek civilians and the French, who
occupied that section, establishing a
complete cordon about the French and
taking all precautions to avoid any
incidlnt or accident capable of start -ine
strife.
It is impossible to predict whether
trouble can be prevented throughout
the night. The Greek government is
fully alive to the fact that Greece's
fate hangs on the prevention of fur
ther measures on the part of the
French commander

Elliott Pleads for
Increased Rates
BEFORE MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC
SERVICE COMMISSION
2 C PASSENGER RATE
Declares New Haven Road Contem
plates Expenditure of $30,000,000 for
Improvements Says Parcel Post is
Causing Delay of Trains.
Boston, Oct. 17. An appeal for in
creased passenger and freight rates
for the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad was made by How
ard Elliott, president of that road, be
fore the state public service commis
sion today. "It is a sum in simple
arithmetic," Mr. Elliott said, "that the
New Haven cannot pay out millions
more each year for labor and mater
ials and have an adequate amount for
betterments and improvements while
the revenue, remains stationary.
Passenger Fares 2 3-4 Cents.
He suggested that local passenger
fares be increased to 2 3-4 cents a
mile and the mileage rate be increased
to 2 1-2 cents a mile from 2 1-4 cents.
The hearing was held as a result of
a recent report of George W. Bishop,
chief inspector for the commission, in
which he stated that the passenger
train service rendered toy the New Ha
ven in Massachusetts was "far from
being reasonable or satisfactory."
President Elliott, who presented the
New Haven's side of the case, said in
part:
Money Being Spent for Improvements.
"As all the money within the con
trol of the company is now being
spent for improvements and payment
of debts, additional revenue should be
permitted by Increasing the rates now
charged for transporting passengers
and freight, for the use of freight
cars used as storage houses and for
the carriage of mail and parcels post.
Trying to Adjust Affairs.
"The various commissions, both
state and national, have been investi
gating and analyzing New Haven af
fairs for a number of years and have
criticized them. The management is
trying to adjust its affairs to meet the
suggestions and criticisms. The time
has come in the United States as a
whole, and particularly, in New Eng
land, which man yof us in the busi
ness world have been expecting,
namely, when transportation is not
sufficient for the needs of the coun
try. The reasons for this are nation
wide and they are accentuated in New
England by the peculiar conditions of
the last five years.
Asks for Constructive Policy.
"Has not the time come now for
Massachusetts and its commission to
take a lead in a constructive and up
building policy toward all railroads,
to help put them in first class condi
tion, in the interests of New England,
which sadly needs better transporta
tion, as well as in the interest of the
unfortunate stockholders? To put
them in better condition needs mil
lions of dollars.
"The quickest and simplest way to
obtain more revenue throughout New
England is to permit an increase in
the .passenger rates, not only on the
steam roads, but on the electric rail
roads. The amount paid by each in
dividual is small, but the aggregate
sum will be large and will hasten the
day when the railroads can finish the
work of improvements.
$30,000,000 for Improvements.
"The New Haven contemplates the
expenditure of $30,000,000 for improve
ments as fast as the company can get
the money, men and material. The
management is aware of the inade
quacy of the passenger service and is
anxious to remedy it as quickly as
possible. Though trains are being
equipped with heavier and better lo
comotives and better equipment is thus
being made available for use on the
branch lines."
Parcel Post Causing Delays.
The parcels post business is largely
responsible for delays to passenger
trains, according to Mr. Elliott, who
said that the railroad was required by
the government to load or unload all
parcels post matter at each station
and that New York trains were fre
quently delayed on this account.

NOMINEE C. E. HUGHES
FRANKLY A.NSWERS HECKLERS
Would Have Submitted Railroad Con
. troversy to the People.
Sioux - City, la.,- Oct. 17. Charles E.
Hughes, facing a friendly audience,
sprinkled with hecklers, tonight re
plied in answer to a question as to
whether he would repeal the Adamson
law if elected president, that "a sur
render could not be repealed."
Mr. Hughes was asked what he
would have done to avoid the threat
ened railroad strike.
"If arbitraricn had been refused,"
Mr. Hughes replied, "I should have
gone right to the American people,
stated the facts, and put the responsi
bility where it belonged.
"I should at the same time," Mr.
Hughes continued, "have secured a
commission of inquiry so impartial, so
fair, as to command the respect of the
entire country, and, directing public
opinion to that end, that there is no
group of men in the United States that
would have dared to hold up the in
strumentalities of commerce if that
were done."
Mr. Hughes spoke before an audi
ence that crowded the auditorium. He
cited his record as life insurance in
vestigator and as governor of New
York in answer to the declaration that
his election might mean the setting up
of "invisfble government" in the
United States.
A man with a big stick in the gal
lery sought to heckle the nominee on
labor affairs. He asked a question
that apparently was misunderstood in
the confusion, and Mr. Hughes, 'mid
a roar of applause, read what the
Legislative News, the official organ of
organized labor, had to say in praise
of his record as governor. When the
applause died the man arose again.
The crowd would have put him out
and for more than a minute the audi
ence was a tumult of confusion.
Mr. Hughes with outstretched hands
sought to quiet the crowd. He finally
made himself heard.
"Let the gentleman ask any ques
tion he wants to," said the nominee.
"What do you want to say?"
Amid hisses and boos the man asked
his question, waving the stick in his
hand.
"Evidently, according to what you
have said," the man began, "the labor
field has taken you from the bench and
put vou up as their standard bearer.
Is that right?"
There were cries of "No! No!" and
"Put him out!" It was some time be
fore Mr. Hughes could make, himself
heard.
"One moment," the nominee shouted
to the crowd. "One moment, please,"
when some sort of order was restored,
and he went on:
"I am not here, sir, as the standard
bearer of any one group or set, tout
desirous to serve the whole of the
American people."
The house roared again, the heckler
sat down, and the nominee went on
with his speech-
CHANGES IN P. E. BOOK
OF COMMON PRAYER.
Prayer for President in the Evening
Instead of in the Morning.
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 17. The house
of deputies of the general convention
of the Protestant Episcopal church
today voted to remove the present
prayer for the president of the United
States from the service of morning
prayer and to substitute therefor the
evening prayer for the president.
The morning prayer asks for the
president the boon "in health, and
prosperity long to live-"
The evening prayer, while contain
ing an intercession for the president,
has no reference to long life, health or
prosperity. Neither does it ask for h,is
eternal felicity.
The change, which was adopted at
the suggestion of the commission on
prayer hook, must be approved by the
house of bishops and by the next
general convention before it can be
come effective.

Committee No Disturbance.

hundred striking employes of the
Standard Oil company who gathered
late today to hear a report from a
