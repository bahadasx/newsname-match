RULES ALREADY MADE
DEEMED SUFFICIENT
Special Regulations Won't
Be Issued Until the
Need Arrives.
London, Oct. 18 Reuters Chris
Mania correspondent says Norway has
Informed the entente's allies 'that it
does not recognize it is its duty to
prohibit passage through or sojdurn
in Norwegian waters by belligerent
submarines.
The Norwegian response is to the
memorandum of the entente powers
to neutrals suggesting that belliger
ents should be excluded from neutral
waters. . The Norwegian note de
clares fhe government has the power
to prohibit submarines engaged in war
purposes and belonging to belliger
ents from passing through Norwegian
territorial waters or sojourning in
them and says it made use of this
right in issuing the royal decree of
Oct. 13, under which belligerent arm
ed submarines are forbidden' to tra
verse Norwegian 1 waters except in
cases of enjergency, when they must
remain upon the surface and fly the
national flag.
The decree also' provides that mer
cantile submarines are to be allowed
In Norwegian waters only In a surface
position In full daylight and when fly
ing the national colors.
On the other hand, the government
does not find that it is its duty toward
any of the belligerents to prohibit
such . passage or sojourn. Concern
ing commercial submarines, the new
Norwegian regulations impose no pro
hibition, it Is pointed out, as far as
concerns - arrival or - sojourn of such
submarines under the codes designat
ed In the royal decree. The Norweg
ian government says. care will be tak
en see that commercial submarine
which may arrive In Norwegian wat
era really bear the Indubitable char
acter of merchant ships.
Until experience has shown that dif
ficulties i may ' anise Tor maintenance
of neutrality in consequence of the- use
of commercial submarines, the note
continues; the question -o(r issuing
special news regulations for such ves
sels cannot be taken Into considera
tion. In view of the generally recog
nized precepts, of Impartial neutrality
which were given clear expression- in
the Introduction to' the thirteenth
treaty adopted at The Hague, the
government says it is always necessary
aunng tne existence of war to avoid
a change of neutrality regulations un
less experience demonstrates the ne
cessity of doing so in Order to protect
neutral states in their own rights.
Norway's position in some respects
is similar to that of the United States.
which in replying to the submarine
memorandum of the entente - allies,
said Vhat in Its opinion "the allied
powers have not set forth any cir
cumstance, nor is the government of
the United States at present aware of
any circumstances, concerning the use
of war or merchant submarines which
would render the existing rules of
international law Inapplicable to
them.

David E. Fitzgerald, of the Demo
cratic state central committee, today
notified J. Henry Roraback, chair
man of the Republican state central
committee, that he concurred In the
proposal for a Joint debate between
United States Senator- George P. Mc
Lean, Republican candidate for re
election and his Democratic opponent.
Homer S. Cummings, of Stamford, on
the issues of the campaign to be held
at Waterbury, Oct. 31. '
Considerable correspondence has
taken place between the two chairmen
over the meeting of the respective
candidates, the primary suggestion
having come from the Democratic
side for a series of Joint debates.
After reviewing the . conference at
length, Mr. Fitzgerald, in his letter
today says:
Mr. Fitzgerald's letter to Mr. Rora
back says: '

DISCOSS CLAIMS
FOR AND AGAINST
DOUBLE TRACKING
Stratford Factions Air Their
Views in Superior Courts
i Hearing. '
The factions In Stratford for and'
against the double tracking of East
Broadway 'appeared before Judge
Gager in the super ior court this morn
ing to testify in the appeal from' the
decision of the Public Utilities com
missioners, favoring the projecf A
number of property owners in East
Broadway were opposed to the double
tracking but the three selectmen ap
peared in favor of.lt and so did Presi
dent. Earl French of thfc' Devon" Im
provement association. . State High
way Commissioner Bennett and Con
necticut Co. officials also testified that
the double-tracking was needed.
Alice Hudson, a property owner on
that thoroughfare, said the street was
too narrow for two tracks. She said
that with two tracks there would be
no room for carriages Or automobiles
ta stop in front of her home. She
thought property values would be in
decreased by the change. Julia
Thompson, another property owner,
also thought the double-track system
would decrease land values.
jsupu unaries vjimymitu ui i no uu
necticut Co. said there was no other
street that, could carry the heavy
traffic between this city and the shore
colonies beyond Stratford. He de
clared this one block was one of the
few stretches of single track that re
main in the Bridgeport-New Haven
line. - " '
John K. Punderford, general man
ager of the Connecticut Co., explained
that the tracks would have ten foot
centers and .there would be nine and
one-half between the outside rail and
the curb. This is one foot and one-
half more than the distance required
by law. He declared public conven
ience required a double track at this
point.
First Selectman James Lajly testi
fied that the doube track was badly
needed. He said the present system
resulted in a tine-up of cars in the
center of Stratford during rush hours.
It would be of great benefit to com
muters if the double tracks were in
stalled, thereby, permitting cars to run
on a faster schedule. , Selectman John
J. . Williams and Fred W. Nettletop
testified along the same line.
Judge' Gager reserved decision.
CITY WILL PAY
HALF WHAT THE
OWNERS ASKED
Bridgeport's Pumping Sta-
tion Site Cost Fixed By
Court at $48,40U.
The city of Bridgeport must pay
pay 48,400 for the Cedar creek prop
erty which is desired for a pumping
station. Thlswas the decision given
today by the commission appointed by
the superior court to . appraise the
property, which is part of the
Nathaniel Worden estate. The com
mission's finding is a victoy for the
city, inasmuch as the Worden estate
riemaTided 898.000 for the property.
The city wasiot willing to pay more
than $20,000, but probably named this
figure as a basis for further negotia
tions. -- .
During the hearing" before the com
mission City Attorney William H.
Comley, Jr., Introduced as a witness
City Engineer Terry, who said that
part of the tract was under water at
high tide and that it would cost the
city a large sum to fill in the land.
The members of the commission were
Attorneys J. Birney Tuttle and John
N. Wheeler of New Haven, and Fred
A. Taff of Stamford.
DEBATE IN
made this suggestion because tha
cities mentioned are the four leading
cities of the state and are convenient
places for large assemblages to gather
and are well equipped with newspaper
facilities.
That such debates would attract
wide; attention is manifest. That they
would go far toward clearing the po
litical sluatlon Is undoubted and that
they would offer the people e. fair op
portunity to see and hear both Mr.
McLean and Mr. Cummings and Judge
between them is also clear. - This
method of presenting political Issues
has long been familiar to the public.
It was not beneath the dignity of
President Lincoln or Senator Douglas,
and in our own state there were at
least three famous debates, one series
between Congressman Russell and the
well known economist David A. Wells.
There were also debates between
Congressman Sperry and Mr. Sorgunt
of New Haven and recently there were
debates between Congressman Hill and
Congressman Underwood.
Of- course, I realize, as you also
evidently' do, that several debates be
tween the same candidates constitute
a severe ahd striking test of their
respective abilities. . It Is a compsiri-
son that we seek and solicit tind
which evidently you desire to avoid.

v Battle In Bar Boom.
Every liberty-loving Lithuanian
dispises the Czar Nicholas, with
hatred Implacable, and revers the
memory of Tolstoi with a love akin
to idolatry. A dozen of them this
morning demonstrated this fact, fight
ing with such valor and fierceness,
that they turned the liquor store, at
424 Main street topsy-turvy. '
Pool balls rained through the air
like hail, chairs broke against wall,
the splinters flying like shrapnel,
knives were flashed, and a scene re
sembling the meeting of two opposing
companies of infantry ensued.
The neighborhood was thrown Into
a state of wild excitement and a riot
call sent to the police, with the result
that seven of the participant) tho
smallest of whom weighed 184 pounds,
were arrested by Policemen T. Flynn
and P. Riley. , ,
From the many stories of the af
fray, it, is gathered that the Lithuan
ians, pleasure-bent visited the sa
loon, at 10:30 this morning. They
were uproariously happy. One of
their number proceeded to drum an
air on the piano, while a secona sang
a song, to entertain the others who
were playing ' pool.
The key was bad, and the efforts
of the player to strike the right one
exasperated a nervous member of the
crowd who reached over and ripped
off a half dozen of the ivories, in
viting ' the,' singer to .pick whatever
key he chose.
At the pool tables a discussion of
the inevitable subject, the' war, is said
to haves tarted at this point. The
Czar's name was heard mentioned.
while a late comer, grabbing a pool
stick waved it In the air saying some
thing about Tolstoi in his native ton
gue. '
Some one drew a knife, a pool
ball whistled through the air, next a
chair crumpled on the wall, ana a
pool sticl. struck on some pne's head
with a resounding whack the battle
was on. Bartenders took to the
trench behind the resplendent rail;
the proprietor, fearing for his life
fled.
Participants were catapulted over
the pool tables, with the speed of a
shell from a Krupp gun and blood
was flowing freely when the police
arrived on the scene to separate the
belligerents. . .'
The seven men arrested gave the

that party next month Would endanger the country's prosperity,!
were voiced Here today by William G. McAdoo, secretary of the
treasury, before a noon political meeting in a downtown thea-e
tre. ' .
"The American people are being asked to put in peril the
peace and prosperity the country is now enjoying under Presn
ident Wilson by turning their government over to the inexperi-j
enced Mr. Hughes and the organized band of incompatible ele-fj
ments which are supporting himN," said Mr. McAdoo. 1
' Still No Answer From Hughes ' , f
. "For two months, they have condemned every act of then
Democratic administration in the most unfair and untruthful
manner, but the American people are still without a definite an-
swer from Mr. Hughes as to what they will do with the govern-j
ment if they get possession of it
. "The only definite, thing we have had in the campaign fromij
Gol. Roosevelt, who said at Battle Greek, discussing the LusUr
tania: . ' ! '
" 'You ask me what I would hav done. I would have seiz-
ed every interned German ship'."
' Action Would Precipitate War
Mr. McAdoo then quoted Germany's declaration of war on
Portugal because of seizures of German ships by that country
and added : '
"Mr. Roosevelt action would have1 resulted in war between
the United States and Germany. And now comes Mr. Hughes
and admits, as far as he 4s ever definite, his accord with the beK
licose attitude of Mr. Roosevejt. This is shown, by his reply to
the question as to what he would have done in the Lusitania
case. He 'said, in substance, that he would have threatened the .
Kaiser so effectively that 'the Ltasitania would never have been
sunk.' ; This is characteristic evasion,for Mr. Hughes was ask-;
ed what he would have done after the Lusitania had been sunk, ,
I challenge him to answer that question.
Sees Roosevelt Dominating Hughes v t
"Who can doubt that if Mr. Hughes is made President Mr.j
Roosevelt will be the dominating influence and direct foreign!
and domestic policies?
' - .....
"A President has it in nis power to piunge me country init)
war at any moment.. A single misstep or rash act or blunderj .
on his part is all that is necessary. It 'does not require courage;
or statesmanship to provoke war. ' Any wild man-or blunderer'
in the Presidential chair can precipitate such a calamity."
