the mutilated bodies of Andrew Frey,

Chicago, Oct. 17.—Mayor Thompson
testified today that he was guided
largely by the recommendations of
the chief of police, Charles IS. Healey,
in revoking and in restoring saloon
licenses.
Restorations, however, ho said, usu­
ally were backed up by the pleas of
"reputable citizens, influential busi

Members of House of Commons
Complain of Many Inade­
quate Measures
London, Oct. 17.—In the house of
commons today a debate arose over
the food situation, a number of the
members complaining of the inade­
quate measures of the government to
control food supplies and prevent an
excessive rise in prices.
Walter Runciraan, president of the
board of trade, in reply to the com­
plaints, said he was hungering for a
practical proposal, which had not
been forthcoming. For preventing
evils that were largely due to the in­
creased food consuming acpacity, not
only of the army, but of munitions and
other workers, and the decreasing
supplies of food
Mr. Runciman said there was no evi­
dence of serious monopolization, or
exploitation of foodstuffs and if there
had been, he would not have hesitat­
ed to ask parliament for power to
deal with such a situation.
In relating the measures the govern*
ment has taken with regard to meat
and wheat, Mr. Runciman said every
effort was being made to increase
available tonnage for imports and that
the admiralty had agreed in many in­
stances to do with a smaller number
of vessels. In conclusion, the presi­
dent of the board of trade said there
would be no extension of the principle
of rationing and that the government
had no intention of putting the country
in the position of a blockaded city.

Hughes Answers Question Rel­
ative to Celebrated Threaten­
ed Rail Strike
WOULD PUT FACTS TO
AMERICAN CITIZENS
Sioux City, la., Oct. 17.—Charles E.
Hughes, facing a friendly audience
sprinkled with hecklers, tonight re­
plied in answer to a question as to
whether he would repeal the Adam­
son law if elected president, that "a
surrender could not be repealed."
Mr. Hughes was asked what he
would have done to avert the threat­
ened railroad strike.
"If arbitration had been refused,"
Mr. Hughes replied. "I should have
gone to the American people, stated
that facts and put the responsibility
where it belonged."
"I should, at the same time," Mr.
Hughes continued, have secured a
commission of inquiry so impartial,
so fair, as to command the respect of
the entire country, and directing pub
lie opinion to that end there is no
group of men in the United States
that would have dared hold Up the in­
strumentalities of commerce if that
were done."
Mr. Hughes cited his record as life
insurance investigator and as gover­
nor of New York, in answer to the
declaration that his election might
mean the setting up of "invisible gov­
ernment" in the United States.
A man with a big stick in the gal­
lery sought to heckle the nominee on
labor affairs. He asked a question
that apparently was misunderstood
in the confusion, and Mr. Hughes,
amid a roar of applause, read what
the Legislative News, the official or­
gan of organized labor, had to say
in praise of his record as governor.
When the applause died, the man
arose again. The crowd would have
put him out and for more than a min­
ute the audience was a tumult of
confusion.
Mr. Hughes, with outstretched
hands, sought to quiet the crowd.' He
finally made himself beard.
"Let the gentleman ask any ques­
tion he wants to," the nominee said.
"What do you want to say?" Among
hisses, the man asked his question,
waving the stick in his hand.

city yesterday on business and while

"In the meantime we set to work to

Are Repulsed
London, Oct. 17.—With the occupa«
tion of Athens and Piraeus by marines
from the warships4 of the Entente
powers, a tense situation has arisen
in Athens. Great crowds of Royalists
have paraded the streets of the Greelc
capital, cheering the king, and cor
dons of Greek troops and marines have
been thrown about the railroad sta*
tions, city hall, and other points occu*
pied by the Entente forces, to prevent
clashes between them and the Royal*
ists. An unofficial dispatch says Ad*
miral Du Fournet was hissed by the
throngs in the streets of Athens and
that a detachment of French soldiers
was driven back by the hostile crowd.
A Reuter's dispatch from Athens
says:
"The situation appears to be dan*
gerous. There have been Royalists'
demonstrations in the streets. A pro*
cession of some 4,000 malcontents*
headed by the Greek and American
flags, stopped outside the American
legation, protested against the ianij*
ing of the foreign marines and de*
manded the protection of the Ameri*
can minister, who was absent.
"The demonstrators then paraded
the streets, singing the. Greek nation*
al anthem."
King Constantine, In a spSefch td the
officers of his fleet, told the men he
would stand by them, no matter what
consequences might follow their loy*
alty to Greece.
Germans Repulsed on Somme.
Volhynia, Galicia, and TransylvanUC
are still the points where the heaviest
fighting is taking place. Along the,
Somme in France bombardments
alone have prevailed, except to the
east of Belloy-en-Santerre, where the
Germans threw two attacks against
the French, only to be repulsed.
Bad Weather in Eaat.
In Macedonia, the hostilities have
been confined mainly to patrol en­
gagements and artillery duels. Bad
weather has set in throughout the
Austro-Italian theater, and with
snow in the mountains and rains in
the valleys little fighting of moment
has taken place.
Austro-Germans Make Gains.
Continuing their violent offensive
in Galicia, the Austro-Germans, accord*
ing to both Berlin and Vienna, have
taken trenches over a front of one and
one-fourth miles from the Russians,
and made prisoners thirty officers and
1.900 men. West of Lutsk, in Volhy*
nia, the Russians attacked violently
many times, but, according to Vienna,
were everywhere repulsed with great
losses. In the southern Carpathians,
near Dorna Watra, additional heights
have been taken from the Russians by
the Teutonic allies.
Romanians Stand Firm.
In Transylvania the Roumanians,
fighting near the border passes, con*
tinue tenaciously, to hold back tbe.
Austro-Germans almost everywhere.
In the Uzul valley, they have driven
tbe invaders back across tbe Rou*
