Nothing When Warned
Crisis Was Near
[rrom i WafT forrrij>r.nr1erit of The Trlbu/i* 1
Sioux City, Iowa, Oct. 17. Charles E.
Hughes, answering a heckler who asked
him whether he would repesl the Adam?
son eight-hour law if he were elected,
declared that a "surrendcr cannot be
rcpealed." Then he told what he would
have done to avert the threatcned rail?
way Mrike.
"If arbitration had been refused," he
said, "I should have gone right to the
Ameriean people, Btatod thc facts and
put thc reepoBflibilitf where it be
longed.
*'I ahould nt the same time have se?
cured a commission of inquiry so im
partial, so fair, as to command the re?
spect of the entire country and direct?
ed public opinion to that end. There is
no group of men in the L'nited States
that would have darcd hold up the in
gtrumentalities of commerce if ihsxl
arera done."
Hecklers in rapid succession to-night
gave Mr. Hughes opportunities to nail
severai charges the Democrats have
spread against him in this part of the
country. llc scized these chances glee
fully, and hi.- answers won him in?
creased cnthusiasm from the 6,000 per?
sons in thc auditonum.
\\ ins on Labor Record
The heckiing on the Adamson law was
the most sensational of thc-e incident!-.
Mr. Hughes had vanquiehed two pre?
vious qucstioners who asked him about
his labor record. They stood far off
in thc balcony. He had passed on to a
discaaaion of ihe Adamson law, as a
menacing indication of the tendency of
the Exflcativfl to yield to force instoad
of Btandinf for principle. ,______?
"Will 1'ou back and back and back,
he askcl, 'hoping that somewhere in
the rear you Will get courage enough to
htand Bl-B for a principle? When prin
eiplfl ia involved, stand now. That is
the way." , ,.
"Mr Hughes," lnterrupted a well
dreaaed man standing right down by
thc atBffl wmg "if you were elected
Preaident would you repeal the Adam?
son bill '."'
?'(annot Repeal Surrender"
**My dear sir," retorted Mr. Hughes,
"you cannot repeal a surrender. .oil
cannot repeal what has been done by
this abdication of authonty, and, fur?
ther, your question rhows that .???_?*
not fully undersund the Adamson bul.
"It goes into effect January 1; then
there is a provision that there shall be
observations of its working. Six flBontbfl
is the minor period, nine months tho
maximum. and then the wages v,h:ch
are to bfl upon thlfl new basis ahall
continue to be paid until thirty d?ys
after the report of the commission..
Will Learn Facts Firat
"Now, sir, thia arill hava been in op?
eration'for a very long time before 1
should even take the executive chair if
elected, and will have completed its pur?
pose before Congress would hav. Its
session in the following December. I
do not suppose that any question of
repeal would be involved, but I do Bay
that when that question ariaea, lf it
doea anae, if I am elected. I will follow
the principle that I now state and have
laat atated of aacertalning the exaot
facts and what Justice would dicUte
ought to be done at that time."
A man then asked: "What would you
have done in the eleventh hour tn avert
and forestall the railroad strike .'
Mr. Hughes waa warming up to this
klrid of campaigning. He made the re?
ply quoted above and tho crowd re
sponded wildly.
Warnlng Not Ileeded
"You would have done all thia in
iw.r.:. -four houri?*' continued the
heckler. __ _.
This was a chance that Mr. Hughea
rehshed. He walked nearer to hia in
terrogator and said:
"Why, air, the business men of the
United States, through thc I hamber of
Commercfl of the I'nited Staten, on July
|9 eent a telegram to the Preaident I
asking for an inquiry. A resolution ;
was introduced in the Senate for an in- |
quiry and was laid on the table. ror!
months the busineas men of the l nited
StBtflfl asked foi an in<-uiry Bl tO this i
very matter, and the crisis waa allowed j
to be developed, when it was unneees- ;
sary that it should have beea devel
oped, and there was adequat*^ tiflflfl to
aaeortaia what the facts were."
Real rrogreaa Republican
Mr Hughes anawered the I'rcsident'a
clairn thal tho Hemocratic party waa
the party of progress with this asscr
"It i* perfectly idle for our j
opponent*. to poae as the special'
guardiani of progress. If I were to
recall at thia fme the greatest service,
that has been rendere.l ia divorcing
buaineaa from politlcfl, in securing fair
regulation of public enterpri-.es and in
th. iBterofltfl of labor I should refer i
?,, Bopublicaa naeaaorea passed under'
Republican adrniniatrationa, which
showed that the Republican party araa
truly a party of '!OITOOl iOfl and a party i
9i bonorajfl ? progress."
Before the applaaae died away a
husky rolee >? tbe Bachad balcony
shouled "Hy compulsion of organi'.ed
labor!" Immediately the house waa m
tumult, but Mr. Hughes silenced thfl
crowd and went on:
"I am raij glad to take this oppor?
tunity aa I am not, perhaps. aa well

BAKER'S SLUR
ON 16 HEROES
IS CONDEMNED
Likening of Patriots
to Villa Bandits
Starts Protest
O.A. R. CHAPTER
DENOUNCES HIM
Members Declare He Is
Unfit for Cabinet
Place
The defenee which Secretary of War
N'ewton D. Baker offered for Mr. Wil?
son's Mexican policies on Monday
night found quick response yesterday
from patriotic Americans but hardly
the. response Mr. Haker could have
wished for.
In a speech in Jersey City, the Sec?
retary' likened the Mexican revolution
ists to the Continentals who fought
with Washington. He admitted the
Mexieans were a rascally lot, but said.
their actions were those of all rebels.
The patriots of the Ameriean revolu- \
tion looted churches and drove minls
tera from them on their famous march
to Valley Korge, he added.
I'rotests have come from far and
near. The Kmpire State Society of the,
Sons of the Ameriean Revolution met;
last night and adopted a resolution !
condemning "in the strongest Urrtij j
the unpatriotic language of the See-.
retary of War." Members of the society ;
were outspoken in their denuncia
tion. Some declared that unless his
rcmarks were repudiated at once by
President Wilson a movement should
be started to force the Secretary's res
ignation.
Friend of Baker*s Joina
The Kmpire State Society meeting
waa in the Waldorf-Astoria. In the
chair was Louis Annin Ames, president
of the society, a Democrat, a stanch
supporter of the Administration and
a close friend of Secretary Baker. He
was asked if he had any person*! com?
ment to make on the action of the head
of the War Department,
"It is all told in the resolution," sald
Mr Ames. "The resolution waa passed
unanimousiy. so it embodies my views.
The resolution followa:
"Whereas, It is reported in The New
York Tribune this morning that Seere
Ury of War Baker, at a public meeting
held in Jersey City last night, used the
following language reflecting upon the
character of the members of Washing
ton's army at Valley Forge, and likened
them to the present Mexican reeolu
tionists:
"'I know that the Mexieans do not
respect Ameriean life ar.d property,
said Mr. Baker. 'I know that they do
not pay their debts, that they are rag
amufRns, thai they desecrate Church
property, thnt their mon**y is no good
and that they are generally worthless.
But people never respect those things
ln revolutiona. We did not respect
them in our Civil War. Waahington'a
soldiers in the march to Valley Forge
stole everything they could lay their
hanJs on; took the silver vessels out of
the churches and sold them to buy
drink. Thev drove miniaters out of tha
churches. their money was worthless
BBd thev weie just as bad ch.ractara
aa the Mexieans.'
"Resolvad, That wa, the deaeendanta
of thc patriots of the Revolution, eon
d-imn in strongest terms the U'_P?trl
ctic language of the Secretary of War,
nnd direct that a copy of this **reamble
nnd resolution be aent to him.
(.lad He Couldn't Come
Some time ago Secretary Baker wai
lnvited to be the guest of honor and de

of the aociety, which will be held on De?

CUT OUTPRaiYER
FOR PRESIDENT
_
Episcopalian Deputies De
cide to Substitute Plea
for Nation
St. Louis, Oct. 17.-The house of
deputies of the general convention of
the l'roteatant Episcopal Church voted
to-day to eliminate the special pr&yers
for the Preaident of the I'nited States
from the morning and evening prayer
service and to substitute for them a
prayer for the safety and preservatlon
of the. nation. The same prayer will
he used in both serviees.
As it is now in the prayer book. the
morning prayer asks for the President
the boon, "in health and prosperity
long to live" and that he finally may
attain everlasting joy and felicity. The
new prayer as adopted for both ser?
viees. while asking that the President
"and all others in authonty" be given
"the wiadom and strength to know and
to do Thy will," makes no reference to
long life, health, proaperity or etemal
felicity.
The house also voted, deaplte vigor
ous proteats, to omit the words "the
Governor of this state" from the even?
ing prayer, it being argued that "all
others In authority" included the gov
ernori.
Muat Be Approred by Blahopa.
The change moat be approved by tha
House of Biihops and by tbi next
general convention before it can be?
come etTective.
Skilful parliamentary manceuvrir.g
saved the resolution admitting **o*nen
to membership in the House of Dep
utiei from being killed by an adverse
committee report. From the time of
the Church's first convention, in Phila?
delphia In 1785, men only have been
allowed to reprcsent dloceses on tne
floor.
The commlsnon to which the resolu?
tion, introduced by Robert EL Gard
iner, of Maine, had been referred, re?
ported the propoied change was Inex
pedient at this time. Mr. Gardiner,
before the report was acted on, m.'.de

BRITISH ASK

Protest HeldUpPend
ing Announcement
by U. S.
London. Oct. 17. The raids of the
U-.3 off the Ameriean coast raised
very important issues. Bntain ex?
pects the I'nited States to announce its
attitude on sueh raids by German aub
marines. Until the Ameriean position
is denned the British government will
not make any official representetion to
the I'nited States.
This statement of the British stand
?as made by Viscount Grey. Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs. in the
House of Lords to-day in reply to a
question raised by Baron Charlea
Beresford. forrner commander of the
British home fleet, who crlticises the
Ameriean reply to the Allied memo
rnndum on submarines and aaid the
Ameriean ideas of neutrality were cu
rious.
Patrol Irrltatlng to I'nited State*
In reply to a question concerning the
attitude of the Unted States toward
brrtlsh patrois, Viacount Gray saiat the
United Statee admitted that British
ships were not execeding their legal
rights under international law, but that
the Ameriean government complained
of their presence on the ground of the
irntation which the eontinued pres?
ence of belligerent warahipe off the
coast of the United States naturally
caused in a neutral country.
He declared the I'nited States had
requested Great Britain very emphat
ica'.iy not to patrol off its coast, and
said that instructiona were sent to the
British ahips thera to avoid cau-ing
any unnecessary irriUtion and to cora
ply as 'ar as possible with the Ameri?
ean request
"With regard to the U-53." the For?
eign Secretary continued, "we do not
know what steps were taken by the
I'nited States for patrolling its waters
or in regnrd to her coming into port
snd securing information from news?
papers.
Awaits Ameriean Announcement
"We do not know whether it is true
th_t Ameriean warships got out of the
Bflbmariae. way. That is a matter for
the Ameriean government only. and we
M8BBM that government is making full
inquiries. We also assume lt will an?
nounce ita attitude in due course.
Pending that. we do not propoie to
make any official representation on the
auhiect of the aubmarine."
The question concerning 'he German
submarine raid in Ameriean waters was
raised by Baron Beresford, Karl Grey,
forrner Governor General of Canada.
and others. Baron Beresford asked
whether British cruisers were removed
from Ameriean wateri owir.g to Ameri?
ean objectiom. and. if io, what steps
thn government proposed for the pro?
tection of Britiih vessels. He wanted
an assurance that the report that
Ameriean commanders of destroyers hau
acceded to the request of the German
submarine commander to clear out of
the way and give him room to b':ow up
shipi waa untrue.
Correepondence Revealed
In replv to Lord Beresford's question,
the Foreign Secretary aummari.ed th.'
correspondence between the I'nited
States and Great Bntain on this sub?
ject since the beginning of the wa*.
In September, 1914, th.> United BtBtflfl
took thc tirst action, interceptmg wire?
less communicationa from a British
cruiser to New York asking for aup
pliea. The view taken was that this
would be making use of United Btatel
territory as a base for suppliea and in?
formation.
ln October of the same year an un
offl n! communication reached the
British government. protesting against
tha ataoenee of Britiah war vessels in
the vicinity ef Ameriean ports. If tbfl
practice was continued, the communi?
cation added, it might be eonstrued as
an act of ur.fnendliness, requinng
action by the I'nited States.
This was followed by an official com
plaint in December, concerning the
shadowing of a ve.sel along the Amer?
iean coast by a British warship.
( alled Patrol l nrourteous
"The complalnt stated." said Vis?
count Grey, "that the British govern?
ment was aware that the United Stat's
government had always regarde.l the
practice of belligerent cruisers patrol?

fnendiy power in time of war, and had
maintained that the conaequent nienac*
of sueh proceedingi to the freedom of
Ameriean commerce waa vexatious and
uncourteoue tn the United Statee."
ViflBOaat Grey said the British gov?
ernment had acted on the assumption
that the Ameriean vr*ew waa still the
