ote Ui Mr. Wilson. If recent
reports aptuk true, the Senator
has been representing to tin
leaders nf the (lennan antl Wil
son sentiment that tbu aipaient
pro Ally policies of the Wilson
atimintstrntton were only for
public consumption, and that prl
vately the President was really
disjnmed to "pull" with the Cer
man American leaders. N o w,
what do you think of thsty If
Ksosror Shme has presented the
situation orrt!y, Mr. Wilson is
not pro Ally at all, but Is really
the Kaiser's man. Of all the fool
things that the present campaign
has produced this outstrips them
all in plain idiooy. Wilson is
England's Mend and has repeat
dly damned all in thic country
who have criticised his one-sided
leaning in his policies relating to
tho Kuropean war. To spring it
on the eve of the election that he
is at heart, with the iiermana of
this country in thels sympathy
with the fatherland become Hie
