NEGROES LYNCHED HY KY. MOB.
Crowd storms Jail-After Lynching
Both Bodies Wore Burned.
Paducah, Ky., Oct. 16.-Two ne
groes were lynched by a mob here to
day and their bodies burned. Ono
was charged with attacking a white
woman and the. other was accused of
voicing approval of his action.
One was taken from the county Jail
and the other was seized on the
streets. Followed by several thou
sand persons the negroes were taken
to the home of the woman, two miles
away. While one of them was pre
sented to her for identification the
other was taken to a tree, a rope
thrown over a limb, his neck encir
cled In a noose and an automobile
hitched to the other end. As soon as
tho other negro had been identified
by tho woman the process was re
peated. The bodies later were taken
down and burned. ,
.y The lynchings came after five
hours' labor to outer the cells in tho
jail and were the outcome of an at
tack Friday upon the woman at her
home. Tho mob gathered about 7
o'clock to-day after hearing that the
police had arrested Brick Finley. .
Tho mob demanded the prisoner,
refused to heed the appeal of city and
?. county officers to disperso and brush
ed aside the police reserves sent to
tho scene. They 'battered down the
jail door, but found the prisoners
locked in steel icells. Falling to find
tho keys, they summoned a foundry
man to cut the bars to 'Finley's cell.
.Shortly before noon he 'had made an
opening sufficient to enable the ne
gro to emerge.
He quietly walked out of the build

CLEMSON FULL TO CAPACITY.
Moi>o Thai? 800 Cadet? Now Enrolled.
Foot Hall Scores-Oconee Club.
Clemson College, Oct. 1G-Special:
Dr. Higgs recently returned from a
week's tour of the boll weevil in
fected sections of Louisiana and
Mississippi. Ile was a member of a
delegation appointed by Governor
Manning to visit portions of these
States and obtain a first-hand knowl
edge of the destructiveness of tills
pest and to study the conditions ex
isting where lt is impossible to grow
cotton. The delegation consisted of
the foremost agricultural leaders of
the State and they will make a report
of the Impressions that have been
made upon them and of the condition
of tile sections the boll weevil has de
vastated. The object of the scheme
is to impress upon the farmers ol'
South Carolina that adequate prepa
rations should be made In order to
keep tlie boll weevil from driving
them from their farms.
Over 300 new students arrived on
September 2Gth and nearly 4 0 more
came in last week. The former en
tered the freshman class, with a few
exceptions, and the latter make up
the one-year agricultural class for
this year. This brings the total en
rollment above the 800 mark, which
ls the capacity of the barracks here,
a number of thc larger rooms having
I three occupants. All cadets here*
! now have been assigned to classes,
sections, etc., and all have begun
their regular work.
Those cadets desiring to do so were
given permission to go to Anderson
October 7th to see the Clemson
Georgla foot 'ball game. Over 400
availed themselves of the opportu
nity and went, but saw Clemson de
feated by a score of 2G to 0. A sDe
cal! train was run from Cherry's to
Anderson and returned the same day
at about ll p. m. .
The University of Tennessee de
feated Clemson here Saturday after
noon by a score of 1 4 to 0. The game
was very Interesting and closely con
tested until the last few minutes of
the game, when the Tennessee team
secured revenge for last year's de
feat hy some extra fine work.
Clemson will play Auburn In Ala
bama next week, but the Clemson
Carolina game at Columbia during
the State Fair is of greater Interest
to every Clemson man, Last year's
game resulted In a tie, and this
eyar's game promises to be a good
j one indeed.
The cadets here from Oconee coun
I ty met one night last week and or
ganized the Oconee County Club. W.
A. Meares, of Westminster, was
elected president; 13, H. Strlbllng. of

Important Hearing to Ho Hold in Co
lumbia on October 25th.
Washington, I). C., Oct. tc.-Spe
cial: A hearing of great Importance
to fanners and farm demonstration
organizations of South Carolina will
be held at Columbia on October 25th
by tho Federal Farm Loan Hoard.
This hearing is for tho purpose of
getting information to guido the
board in determining the boundaries
of tho twelve Federal Land Hank dis
tricts Into which the country is to he
divided for the administration of the
new rural credits law, known as the
Federal Farm Loan Act. The session
will be held in tho Federal building
at Columbia. The members of tho
Federal Farm Loan Hoard who will
conduct this hearing are Hon. Wm.
G. MoAdoo, Secretary of the Treas
ury: Geo. W. Norris, Farm Loan
Commissioner; Herbert Quick, Capt.
W. S. A. Smith and Chas. H. Lobdell.
The board has issued an invitation
to all farmers and farm organizations
of South Carolina to attend this hear
ing to get information about, the
operation of the Farm Loan Act, and
to furnish tho board with informa
tion about the farm loan needs of the
State. It has also asked Interested
cities to present their claims for the
location of one of the twelve Federal
Land Hnnks.
Farmers will be asked lo give in
formation regarding the prevailing
rateB of Interest on first mortgage
loans; the difficulty of getting ex
tensions; the rate of commissions
charged; the development of farms
as affected by credit; farm tenantry
as affected by the ability of tenants
to borrow; and any other fact that
will give the hoard an understanding
of the farm needs of tho State.
Tho new Federal Farm Loan Act
provides a way for the farmer or
prospective farmer to borrow money
on long-time mortgages at actual
cost. The government provides the
machinery for assembling capital to
be loaned to farm owners or pros
pective farm owners. The loans may
run up to F>0 percent of the value of
thc land used an security and 20 per
cent or tho value of the Improve
ments. The loans will he made at a
low rate of interest not yet deter
mined, hut it will be less than fi ->r
cent. Provision is made for the bor
rower to pay off the debt, Interest
nnd principal, through periods of
from five to forty years, at his own
option.
The legislation is expected to prove
a great boon to those sections of thc
country where farm development has
been retarded because of high inter
est rates, and lt is predicted that lt
will tend to make agricultural pros
perity permanent and uniform, sta
bilize and equalize interest rates, and
greatly improve Hie conditio i of the.
farmer.
The nation-wide Interest in the
provisions of the bill is indicated by
the fact that more than 100,000 in
ti ilrieB have come to the Treasury
Department for information about it.
Secretary McAdoo predicts that the
banks will be established and ready
to make loans early in 1917.

Hulls Spread, Derailing Cars-Engine
Crawlies Into Auto.
('linton, S. C., Ort. 15.-Two acci
dents, one already fatal and tho other
very likely to result so, happened
near Clinton this afternoon.
About 2 o'clock, two and a half
miles from here, Seaboard Air Line
train No. 5, solid vestibule, south
bound, left tho track, jim Ha ton,
the colored llreman, In jumping from
the engine, was perhaps fatally In
jured.
Nearly an hour after the Seaboard
Air Line wreck, and a'bout 300 yards
from the scone of it, an automobile
carrying nine passengers waB struck
by Atlantic Coast Lino train No. 53,
from Greenville to Charleston, and
Mrs. Ellen Douglass, a widow, had
her skull fractured, from which ehe
died nt 7.30 to-night at the Clinton
Hospital.
Tile Seaboard accident took place
just bevond Dover .lumtion. It seems
tbnt the train was running at the rate
of about 50 miles an hour and while
it was rounding a sharp curve the
rails spread. The tender, mail car.
combination baggage and passenger
coach wore turned over, while the en
gine and day coach were derailed,
rhe diner. Pullman and observation
cars remained on the track. Many
of the passengers were thrown from
their seats, but so far as can lie
learned, none was seriously hurt.
Train Crashes Into Auto.
The automobile ?truck by the A.
C. L. train was on its way from Clin
ton Mills to Hurricane church, about
five miles from Clinton, with nine oc
cupants, who wero thrown in every
direction. The car was complotely
demolished.
Besides Mrs. Douglass, who was fa
tally hurt, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Crow
were severely bruised, but apparently
not seriously injured. Mrs. Douglass
was the mother of Mrs. Crow. The
other occupants of the car wore chil
dren, who were pretty 'badly shaken
up, but so far as could bo told, not
otherwise hurt. All the inlurod were
brought to tho Clinton Hospital.
lt was stated that the driver of tho
car could not ROO the approaching
train until within a few feet of tho
track and was then unable to stop his
car, although applying tho brakes
until the front wheels -were on tho
track.
Ten Killed, Eleven Injured.
El wood, Neb.. Oct. 15.-Ton men
were killed and ll others seriously
injured when a train on the Burling
ton railroad crashed into the freight
caboose in which they were riding, 12
miles east of here to-day. 'Five other
men standing on the rear platform of
the caboose saw the approaching
train soon enough to jump to safety.
One other man in the caboose was
thrown clear of the wreck and es
caped injury.
The trains in collision were sec
tions of a regular ?tock train. Lack
of lights and warning signals wore
given by survivors as the cause of tho
accident.
Every farmer in South Carolina
needs, and should "have, a good homo
orchard to furnish fruit and berries
for home uso. Ono aero devoted to
such an orcliard will give all the
fresh fruit that a family can uso
throughout tho wholo summer, and a
surplus for canning and preserving
for winter use.
