Put Your Mules to Work This
Fall
Clemson College, S. C.#?
October is the month in which
to begin fall plowing, and it can
be kept up with profit during
most of the fall and winter.
Fall plowing for next spring's
crops not only distributes the la
bor more evenly thruout the
year, but it favors earlier seeding,
improves the soil structure
and kills many injurious insects.
Usually there is a rush at
spring planting time, but in the
fall work is slack. By plowing
in the fall, then, there need not
be such a rush in the spring.
Furthermore, the early seeding
of some crops has a decided ad
..nn?n<v/> /v..n.
vauia^ WC1 laiC dCCUlLl^i US
has been repeatedly shown by
experiments.
Freezing and thawing during
the winter months makes plowed
soils finer. More moisture has
been found in the fall plowed
soils in the spring than usually
is found in the unplowed soils.
White grubs, wire worms, cutworms
and corn-ear worms live
over Winter in the ground.
Plowing in the fall turns them
up to the cold and kills many of
them.
Since you must feed vour
mule if you are going to keep
him, why not use him for fall
plowing and let your land and
crops receive the benefits mentioned.
A handsomely dressed damsel
entered a crowded tram car.
A rough looking old fellow,
wearing a dilapidated hat and a
suit of homespun clothes, rose
to his feet.
"Miss, take my seat. I don't
look as well as these'ere gentleman,"
he said, nodding to sever
al men, "but I've got more politeness."
Without a word of thanks the
young woman sat down.
"Miss," said the old fellow,
with a smile, "I believe I left mv
tobacco-pouch on the seat. Will
you please get up?"
No sooner was the seat unoccupied
than the old fellow deliberately
sat down again.
"Believe I'll keep sittin' here,
miss," he explained. "I've got a
little more politeness than these
'ere gentlemen, but I have found
OUt that I ain't f*Ot niorh sn murti

Atty. General Peeples Will Run
For Governor
Columbia, S. C., Oct. 13.?"I

Blease man that ran on a State

What Me An' Jim Did
Twas jest about five years ago;
Jim Green an* me was at the
sto'?the one that's run by Old
Man Simm, right on the road
not far from Jim?an' we nosed
an' looked around, we spied
some apples, good an' sound.
"Now what's the price of these?"
says Jim. "They're two for five,"
says Old Man Simm. Jim give
a start an' pulled his beard, an'
looked as if he's kinder skeered
?he didn't need no fruit, he
guessed, 'cause with much money
he wa'n't blessed.
This set our heads to workin*
though, an* I said this when I
rose to go: "Somebody growed
them apples, Jim, as sure as fish
and ducks can swim. They
didn't grow that way for fun,
not in a thousand years, my son!
Then if some &uv did grow 'em,
Jim, we're jest as good and
smart as him?an what he done,
we sure can do if we've got the
grit to see it through."
Well sir, we got some saws
an* things, an' perked our orchards
up, by jings! We read
some books on how to spray;
we read some orchard stuff each
day; this put our troubles on the
run, an' growin' apples now is
fun. We furnish Old Man Simm's
store an' jtst about a dozen
more with apples, peaches, bears
an' figs, the finest ever growed
on twigs. The things we did
ain't out of sight; we won out by
a steady fight. So if you want
good fruit to eat, the kind that's
juicy, big an'sweet?w'y, go to
work, work with a vim, an'you'll
win out like me an' Jim.?H. in

Vernon Helms Twice Attempts
Suicide, and Runs Away
Vernon Helms, a young white S
man ot Wingate, attampted sui tl
cide last Thursday morning by v
cutting his throat in the barn at p
the rear of the Helms residence, c
where he was found bv his c
mother a short while afterward, a
Messrs. Kemp Helms and E. C, r
Snider hurried him to a Char- a
lotte hospital, where he made a S
second attempt at his life Friday, 1
Sunday morning he escaped v
from the hospital and was found n
an hour later a few miles down s
the Seaboard railroad. p
Helms is a son of Mrs. Flon- 5
nie Helms and the late Mr. Tal- fi
bert Helms, who was a promi- c
nent farmer of Lanes Creek b
township. His family are excel r
lent people, and there are a great S
many sympathizers. r
The Charlotte Observer gives s
the following account of the f
young man's experiences: t
v
Observer, Sunday. ^
vernon Helms, the young
white man who was brought to
the Brenizer Sanitorium in this ^
city for treatment following an
unsuccessful attempt at suicide g
in Wingate, again attempted to j
end his life at the sanitorium, .
Friday morning, bjT tearing the
bandages from his neck. The
first attempt at Wingate came j
near being successful, Helms ^
cutting his windpipe and half j
severing his jugular vein with a ^
razor. ^
At the hospital Saturday he j
was reported to be resting easily
although his condition is still
serious. ^
According to reports from at
tending physicians, Helms had
bees placed in bijuse&lBhospital
following ac operation, j,
It had been necessary for the ^
surgeon to place an artificial
tube in his wind pipe to allow t|
respiration. tl
With the patient, the hospital j
authorities had stationed an orderlv
on watch to see that he jj
did not injure himself. While ^
the orderly was looking, Helms ^
is said to have reached nn and
pulled the tube loose from his q
throat. k
Aid was immediately summoned
by the orderly, who over tj
powered the man and the wound
was again dressed. It is neces- y
sary now tor the patient's arms
to be strapped to the bed for
fear that he will further harm
himself.
According to hospital attend ai
ants Helms is laboring under the c<
delusion that "God is calling a
! him" and explains his action by ^
that statement. Another reason
which he gives for attempting to J*
hurt himself is that he is the only k
Holy man who ever came to cl
Charlotte and for that reason he j tc
wished to die here. I
