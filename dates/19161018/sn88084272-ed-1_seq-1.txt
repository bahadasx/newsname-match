BERLIN. Germany. Oct. IS. (By

on England on September report,
according to the Overseas News agency,
that trombs hit the Grimsby barracks,
killing more than 400 soldiers, and
that about SO men were killed on board
a cruiser which was hit by a bomb. It
is said that Regent street, London, was
for the mot part laid in ruins.
"Eye witnesses state that more than
100 buildings were badly damaged,
some of them being completely

The news agency gives a quotation
attributed to a London newspaper
whlch th, theorj- is advanced that the
purpose of the reppelin attacks is not
he killing of women and children, but
the curtailment of the production of
ammunition by causing suspension of
work in ammunition factories after
warnings of zeppelin raids have been
given, rather than by the destruction
of factories. The news agency says
this newspaper stated thousands of
working hours were lost in one week
and continues:
"German papers compare these re
sults with the affirmations of British
papers that the air attacks caused no
damage."
