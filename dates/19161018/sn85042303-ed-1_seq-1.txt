ANOTHER BIG
HIGHEST PRICE EVER PAID HERE
WAS RULING TODAY PREDIC
TIONS ARE THAT COTTON WILL
GO TO TWENTY CENTS.
Cotton was selling on the streets
here today for 17.73 to IS cents. This
13 the top price so fur for the season,
but cotton buyers are predicting that
the staple will reach 20 cents. The
highest price ever paid for cotton In
Ardmoro previous to this season was
14 cents, but that season was a fail
ure from the growers' standpoint, as
very light crops prevailed In this sec
tion. The farmers in this locality still
liave a lot of cotton to market There
is quite a lot yet to be picked, and
then too, the recent rains have pre
vented many farmers who have their
cotton out and ginned from putting it
on the market here. Up to last night
approximately 7.000 bales bad been
received from wagons. All this cotton
has brought a good price, nothing
selling under 14 cents, and while the
recent rains will lower the grade of
the remaining crop, It will not mater
ially injure the price to any extent.

JAMES MILLER, 81 YEARS OLD,
SAYS WILSON WISEST PRES
DENT WE HAVE HAD.
New York, Oct. 18. The popular
subscription campaign for the re
election of President Wilson has now
spread into every part of the country.
Hundreds of small sums from people
of all ages and conditions are pour
ing dally into tho office of W. W.
Marsh, treasurer of the Imocratic
national committee. The letters ac
companying these gifts show clearly
that the people appreciate that Wood
row Wilson is their president and
that they welcome tho opportunity to
contribute their share to offset the
wealth of Wall street that is being
poured into the Republican cam
paign. Miss Alice Armstrong writes from
Baltimore: "This Is pitifully little,
but, if a million times as much. It
could only faintly express my appre
ciation of our efficient and faithfu
prescient."
'He is engaged in the work of the
world." declares Francis Olcott Al
len, Jr., of Philadelphia. "No limited
Americanism animates blm. In either
his domestic or foreign policies. His
patriotism Indues the aspirations of
all peoples."
Miss Ida Hagen of Lake Linden,
Michigan, sent $10 and writes that it
was from a teacher who wishes she
could afford to send one hundred
times as much to nelp reelect the
greatest man in the world to the of
fice which he has filled with so
much credit to himself and so much
honor to the country."
"As a great leader of a nation, and
as a solver of great national prob
lems, bis equal has certainly not ap
peared since Lincoln, and I am some
what doubtful If It ever has," declares
Dean Swift, a prominent patent law
yer of Washington, D. C.
Dr. S. Wolfenstein of Cleveland,
former superintendent of the Jewish
orphan asylum In Ohio, declares that
the president's demonstration that a
Republican victory would Involve us
In war caused the German-American
element to think, and that "a large
number of Germans w ill vote f or ,
Mr. Wilson."
Says Ella Goad Hooker of Itur. j
lingame, California: "Mr. Hughes's,
election would mean handing the
I'nlted States over to the rule of
that Invisible and ruthless govern
ment of those quiet, fklllful. well
equlppel gentlemen who know exact
ly what they want, and. when the
Republican rrty is In power, how to
get It, without a fuss but at great
