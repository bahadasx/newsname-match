GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN., OCTOBER 18, 1916
FOREST FIRES THREATEN
VILLAGE LAST SATURDAY
Northwest Wind Drives Flames to
Our Very Door Steps. No
Damage Done.
On Saturday afternoon our village
was threathened by a forest fire
which swept toward the western
part of the village at an alarming
rate of speed, driven by the south­
westerly wind which had been blow­
ing all day and which seemed to
gain in velocity as the fire neared
the residences of the village. For­
tunately at sundown the wind died
down somewhat and changed to
more northwesterly direction. The
fire burned to within about one hun­
dred feet of the Axel Berglund, John
Anderson and A. V. Johnson resi­
dences.
While the fire was quite a menice
to the safety of the village for pe
veral hours on Saturday, it Jias
proved to be more or less of a blejss
ing in disguise as it will lessen the
danger from forest fires for sevcjral
years to come. It has also cleaned
up considerable land on the farims
west of the village and next yfear
will see a good many additional acres
under cultivation which could mot
haye been prepared without great
expense in hand clearing.
The fire which threatened the vil­
lage was the result of two fires
meeting within our village limits one
coming from the west and the other
coming from farther north. Thej &
was no damage to timber excepjt
some that was only valuable as fire­
wood. i,
For a time the farm residences of
Ole Allen, J. N. Brenton, Mrs. Mary
Method and Chris Murphy were in
danger but this was before the fire
had progressed to endanger the vil­
lage and quite a number of our citi­
zens had gone out there to assist
in protecting the property in that
settlement.
The fire along the shore road was
burning on both sides of the road
and the auto stage and a large num­
ber of auto tourists bound for our
village were compelled to make a,,
dash through^ the dense smoke-
trUr
the intense heat from the fires a
long the road. One auto turned
back a short distance west of the
village and drove to Lutsen, driving
through to the village on Sunday
morning.
Other fires were reported on Sat­
urday at Elbow Lake, North Lake,
Island Lake and several other points
in the county. While the brush and
weeds and dead and down timber
was quite dry, the soil was puite
damp and there was very little burn­
ing in the ground as there was dur­
ing the destructive fires of the past.
DEATH OF MRS: PEPPLE
Late last week news reached here
of the death at Worthington, Minn.,
her home, of Mrs. Samuel F. Pepple,
mother of Mrs. Jack Scott, Jr., of
this place. Mrs. Scott, who went to
Worthington several weeks ago, on
account of the illness of her mother,
was at her bedside when' death
came.
In a notice of Mrs. Pepple's death,
the Worthington News pays the de­
ceased this beautiful tribute:
"The deceased was a woman of re­
markable character and refinement,
as is evidenced by the sons and
daughters in whom she must have
taken great pride. Between these
and herself existed a strong attach­
ment, which brought them to her
bedside from the corners of the na­
tion when it was thought her end
was near. And in them she still
lives on."
Narrow Escape from Drowning
Mrs. Hjalmer Eliasen of Hovland,
was horrified on last Friday to have
her two oldest chidren come in and
tell her that her youngest child was
in the lake. She immediately ran
out to find that the infant was float­
ing in the chilly waters of Lake Su­
perior and she immediately summon­
ed help who carried the apparently
lifeless body into the house. Resu­
scitation efforts were commenced
immediately and continued for over
an hour before the child responded
by coughing and expellingX some of
the Water that it had swallowed.
From the last reports that we
have received the child is suffering
no bad results from its narrow es­
cape.
For Sale—Three second-hand sew­
ing machines in good condition.

TITANIUM VALUABLE
IN CASTING STEEL
Ore That Was Considered Useless is
Now Found to be Valuable. Large
Quantities in Cook County.
By D. E. Woodbridge, M. E.
The steel industry has expanded so
greatly as a result of the war in
Europe that ironmasters, foundry
men and chemists have been busy
for a year or two devising improve­
ments in the use of various alloy
metals during the processes of mak­
ing steel. Their experiments have
found uses for some of these ele­
ments and have greatly extended the
efficacy of others until, under sharp
demand the prices paid have put in­
to profitable operation many proper­
ties that hereto have been of limited
commercial value. Among these ele­
ments, titanium, hereto much neg­
lected, and even regarded as a detri­
ment in smelting iron ore, has been
found useful as a deoxidizer in the
preliminary casting operation, and
steels treated*with it have been
found to possess certain valuable
qualities not found in other metals.
In fact, although it does not rectify
•all the existing evils in the steel
casting operation it goes a long way
toward making steel better.
The ordinary deoxidizers of iron
and steel are ferrosilicon and ferro
managanese, but it has become ne­
cessary to use a more active agent
,for cleansing and purifying steel de­
signed for certain uses, so ferro-ti­
tanium has come into popularity and
is admirably adapted for this pur­
pose. Ferro-titanium, as made by
the electrical furnace, carries in the
neighborhood of 15 per cent titan­
ium, 75 per cent iron and the bal­
ance carbon and other elements. It
would be comparatively easy to
make such an alloy from ores exist­
ing in northern Minnesota, especially
in Cook county, many of which ores
run up-to 13 per cent titanium.
Titanium is called a rare metal,
but is only so because it is seldom
met with in nature under its own
§nd identity. This is because it
unites with extraordinary eagerness
with berth the oxygen and nitrogen
of the atmosphere and with other
elements and metals prevalent in na­
ture, and because it can be separat­
ed from these combinations only
with great difficulty, so that it has
never been found in the free state
and has rarely been reduced from
its compounds by artificial means. In
every other respect it is far from
rare, for it is on of the ten com­
monest elements in the earth's crust
The fact above noted, that it unites
with extraordinary eagerness with
other elements is the secret of its
value as a cleanser of steel. It
unites with the impurities and car­
ries them away.
From the standpiont of the blast
furnace, iron ores are not classed as
titaniferous unless they contain
more than 2 per cent or three per
cent titanium, because smaller pro­
portions give no especial difficulty
in smelting. But there are moun­
tains of iron ore in various parts of
of the world, including Sweden,
Greece, Australia, and North and
South America, that are idle because
they contain from 5 per cent to 50
per cent titanium oxide. Most of
these titanium bearing, or titanifer­
ous, ores are magnetic.
The separation of titanium from
iron in these titanium magnetites is
usually carried out with great diffi­
culty and high losses of iron be­
cause of the iron in the ore is con­
tained in two different chemical
combinations, one called magnetite
(Fe 304), the other called ilmentite
(FeTi 02). Both these minerals,
magnetite and limentite, contain
iron in chemical combinations with
oxygen, and in the case of limentile,
in chemical combination with both
oxygen and titanium. It is impos­
sible to break chemical combinations
by mechanical means, such as mag­
netic separation and the like, there­
fore when magnetic separation is ap­
plied to these ores, a large portion
of the iron in the limentite is car­
ried through in tailings, and the
higher the percentage of titanium
in the ore, the higher will these
tailings assay in iron. Extensive
experiments have been carried on
with certain crude ores assaying 35
per cent iron, making this separa­
tion a commercial impossibility.
But there is a certain use for high
titanium alloys. How limited this
use may be is shown by the fact
that in making steel rails, for in­
stance, an addition of 13 pounds of
ferro-titanium containing 15 pounds
of titanium to the ton is sufficient

Mis. F. R. Paine returned last
Wednesday evening from Ashland,
Wis., at which place on Monday last
the body of her mother, Mrs. Ca­
therine Hedican, was laid at rest in
the family cemetery, following fu­
neral services at the Catholic church
at that place.
Mrs. Hedican, whose death was
briefly noted in these columns last
week, was born in Kerry county, Ire­
land, in 1827, she being 89 years old
at the time of her death. At the
age of nine years she emigrated with
her parents to Pembrook, Canada,
and at the age of nineteen she mar­
ried Edward Hedican at that place.
Thirty-one years ago the family
moved to Ashland, Wis., where her
husband died and was buried in 1891.
Following the death of her husband
she remained in Ashland about three
years and then came to Grand Ma­
rais, having since made her home at
this place with her daughter, Mrs.
F. R. Paine.
Mrs. Hedican was the mother of
eleven children, eight of whom are
still living, the surviving children be­
ing five sons, Michael, Thomas, John,
Daniel and Patrick and three
daughters, Mrs. Patrick Maney, Mrs.
John Hanlon and Mrs. F. R. Paine.
Through the ravages of age Mrs.
Hedican was bed ridden during the
last three years of her life. She
was a patient sufferer, and with her
pious thoughts ever turned to hea­
ven, death came to her as to one
passing into pleasant dreams. Hav­
ing outlived the alloted span of life,
the bereaved ones may well find
much to console them in the beauty
and peacefulness of her departure.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.

Turkestan Seed to Make up For
Short Domestic Supply—Unde­
sirable for Humid Sections.
During the fiscal years ending
June 30, 1913, 1914, and 1915, ap­
proximately six million, five million,
and seven million pounds, respective­
ly, of alfalfa seed were imported,
while during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1916, less than three and
one-fourth million pounds were im­
ported.
For several years Russian Turke­
stan has been the only country hav­
ing a large surplus of seed available
for international trade, but the sup­
ply of seed from this source has
been practically shut off since the
beginnning of the European war, un­
til the past winter, when shipments
were begun by the way of the trans
Siberian railway, Vladiyostok, and
the Pacific ocean. Of the seed im­
ported into the United States since
July 1, 1915, more than half has been
from Russian Turkestan, and no
doubt more of this seed will be
brought in as transportation can be
arranged.
The short domestic supply of last
year, together with the decreased
imports, have resulted in a marked
increase in the price of seed over
that of a year ago. The lack of al­
falfa seed in this country this year
must be made up by importation,
and this will necessarily be Turke­
stan seed. It is known that Turke­
stan seed is not well adapted fo
general use in the United States and
that it is particularly undesirable

RURAL SCHOOL WEEK
October 16 to 20th is Rural School
Week throughout Minnesota. The
State Department of Education has
sent to certain selected counties of
the state, men connected with the
Department of Education, the State
University, and the State Noi'mal
Schools. These men visit the i*ural
schools of the county in company
with the county Superintendent of
Schools, for the purpose of learning
the actual conditions in the rural
schools of the county and to secure
information that will enable the De­
partment of Education to be of
greater service to such schools.'
Supt. R. E. Denfield, of Duluth,
has been detailed by the State De­
