LONDON, Oct. 17. A Reuters
dispatch from Athens says:
"The situation appears to be
dangerous. There have been roy
alist demonstrations in the streets
Admiral Du FWurnet, commander
of the entente allied fleet in the
Mediterranean, was hissed in the
streets and a detachment of
French sailors was driven back
by a hostile crowd.
"A procession of some 4000 mal
contents, headed by the Greek and
American flags, stopped outside
the American legation, protested,
against the landing of foreign
marines, and demanded the pro
tection of the American minister,
who was absent The demon

ATHENS, Oct.' 16, via London. Oct

explains that the landing of" marines
at Athens and Pireaus was merely in
tended to reinforce the police. It is
generally thought, however, that this
action was taken to prevent demon-
strations like those of this morning i
(Monday).
Take Greek Capital
ATHENS, Oct. 17. Marines from
the ships of the Entente powers to the
number or about a thousand, have
been landed at Piraeus and have oc
cupied the railway station at Piraeus
and several buildings in Athens. Im
mediately this became known the
streets of Athens swarmed with
Greeks frantically cheering King Con
stantino and chanting the Greek na
tional hymn. Great crowds marched
through the streets, thousands gath
ering in the neighborhood of the post
office square.

The war minister. General Dracos,
ordered out Greek troops and marines
to guard every approach to the square

Outbreak Expected
It is impossible to predict whether
trouble could be prevented through
out the night. The Greek government
is fully alive to the fact that Greece
fate hangs on the prevention of fur
ther measures on the part of the
French commander.
Earlier !n the day a review by King
Constantine of the sailors belonging
to the vessels or the Greek navy,
which were taken possession of by
the allies, was made the occasion for
an immense royalist demonstration,
crowds parading the streets hauling
life-size portraits of the sovereign and
wildly cheering for the monarch.
Adm'ral Damianos. minister of Mar

the loyaltv of the sailors and compli

most trying circumstances.
After the ceremony the king assem

EPISCOPALIANS REVAMP
PRAYER FOR PRESIDENT.
"
ST. LOUIS. Oct 17 The house
of deputies of the general conven-
tion of the Protestant Episcopal
Church voted to eliminate the
special prayer for the president
of the United States from the
morning and evening prayer ser-
vice and to substitute for them
a prayer for the safety and pre-
servation or the nation. The
same prayer will be used in both
services.
As it is now in the prayer book,
the morning prayer asks for the
President the boon "in health and
prosperity long to live," and that
he finally may "attain everlasting
joy and felicity." The- new pray-
er as adopted for both services.
while asking that the President
"and all others in authority" be
given "the wisdom and strength
to know and to do thy will,"
makes no reference to long life,
health, prosperity or eternal fell-

CORPORATION COMMISSION
LOSES SUIT
PHOENIX, Oct. 17. That the law
is unconstitutional and that it would
force an unreasonable conflict with
.the rights of a corporation to conduct
its business, were reasons given by
Judge Wm. W. Morrow of the federal
court this morning for making perma
nent the temporary injunction of the
Copper Queen Mining Company a
gainst the state corporation commis
sion and the Attorney General. There
will be no appeal.
Judge Morrow spoke the decision of
himself, with Judges Van Fleet and
Sawtelle concurring, and the order, to
be drawn up by the attorneys for the
con-plaining corporation, will be sign
ed by the judges.
Judge Morrow said among other
things that if the law should stand, it
would prevent the company from ever
going into bankruptcy, or litigating a
patent, or taking any legal action that
might require federal jurisdiction. The
statute under which the state sought
to revoke the charter of the company
says that it shall be unlawful for a
corporation to take an action from a
state to a federal court, under certain
circumstances. The suit was in no
manner a fight, but was merely to de
cide once and for all whether the law
was constitutional or not

SIOUX CITY. Ia., Oct. 17. Charles
E. Hughes, facing a friendly audience
sprinkled with hecklers, tonight re
plied in answer to a question as to
whether he would repeal the Adamson
law if elected president that "a sur
render could not be repealed."
Mr. Hughes was asked what he
would have done to avoid the threat
ened railroad strike.
"If arbitration had been refused,"
Mr. Hughes said, "I should have gone
right to the American people, stating
the facts and put the responsibility
where it belonged."
Delay Was Fatal
"I should at the same time," Mr.
Hughes continued, "have secured a
commission of inquiry so impartial, so
fair as to command the respect of the
entire country and directing public
opinion to that end that there is no
group of men in the United States that
would have dared hold up the instru-
meniauues oi commerce u mat were
done."
The heckler still had another ques-
tion to ask.
"Mr. Hughes," he said, "any ques-
tion that is asked here Is asked with
no enmity toward the candidate or the
Republican party. You would have
done all that within twenty four
hours?"

"Why. sir." the nominee replied.
