Anti-entente Demonstrations
Result From Seizure of
Nation's Navy.
Irternctienal News Service:
ZURICH, Oct. IS. French and
Italian marines who are policing
Athens, have arrested a number of
the ringleaders in the anti-entente
riots, according to a dispatch from
the Greek capital today.
LONDON, Oct. 18. The throne of
Kin Constantine of Greece is tot
tering. Civil war threatens the Hel
lenic kingdom.
The Athens correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle reports that the
kind's advisers have counselled him
to abdicate and llee. The seizure of
the Greek navy ami the landing of
strong forces of French and Italian
sailors and marines in Piraeus and
Athens have brought about a situa
tion more dangerous than any other
that has existed in Greece since the
war began.
It is believed that Gen. Sarrail,
the commander-in-chief of the
Anglo-French armies in the Falkans
will establish powerful military
posts in Athens and the other chief
cities of Greece at once.
Intermittent rioting has been in
process in Athens, Piraeus and
ether cities during the last 48 hours.
Itecent anti-entente demonstra
tions have been carried out. Vice
Admiral Fournet. comander-in-chief
of the Anglo-French lleet in
the Mediterranean, received a hos
tile greeting when he visited Athens.
Crowds also gathered in front of the
I.ritish legation shouting "Down
with I'ngland."
The Fnited States flag has played
an important part in the demonstra
tions. Four thousand Greeks, somo
of them carrying the United States
l!au', marched to the United States
legation, to make formal protest
against the entry of foreign sailors

MAY
"AMERICA FIRST, AND AMERICA ALWAYS" OR IS IT "REPUBLICANISM FIRST, AND
REPUBLICANISM ALWAYS " THAT IS OUR MAIN STREET CONTEMPORARY'S GOSPEL?
Thank you! The Tribune, stune; to sensibility by
the following criticism published in The News-Times
this morning, that paper comes out this afternoon, in
a brief editorial, and following what it said previous
to the arrival of Mr. Hughes, checks itself into saying
that the public should turn out to honor the nation's
executive. Our criticism, however, on the basis of the
orginal reason for it, still stands:
For a specimen of the infinitesimal smallness of republican
politics even as it permeates the republican press; as witness
ing its snakelike' policy of hiding whatever comes along that
might tend to throw a different light on the things that it is
contending for, while exaggerating whatever looms in its ap
parent favor we commend you, gentle reader, to the minia
ture publicity given by our Main st. contemporary Mondav, to
the announced coming of the president of the United States
for a brief stop in South Bend. It amounted to a measly
nine-line item, hidden inside the paper, followed yesterday
without mention. characteristic, indeed, of a party, and a
party organ, so much more partisan than patriotic, and afraid
to be trank, open, and even respectable, in the face of its lack
of real issues, toward the nation's executive.
It makes no diifcrence that Pres't Wilson is a candidate for
re-election he is president of the United States. It would
make no Jiilerence if he were coming to make a political
.speech, which he isn't. In the same issue of our contempo
rary, it has it on the front page, what we had carried in the
morning, they, under glaring headlines, that "Hughes will
be in Niles Wednesday," but that the president is coming to
South Bend, is hidden' Are the republicans afraid to let' the
public see or hear Pres't Wilson, even on a non-partisan sub
ject, for a small ten minutes? It is a tacit admission that they
are; same as their organ's failure to report anything in partic
ular said by John Sharp Williams or livan B." Stotsenburg, in
their speeches here, and then hiding what they did report, was
a tacit admission of their fear to let the public know what was
said.
When The News-Times becomes so weasenly narrow in its
partisanship, and when its party has become so unprincipled
in its advocacies, that it is afraid to let its readers know what
the opposition is saying, or that a representative of the oppo
sition is coming to town; well, it will either suspend publica
tion, turn independent, or else go over to the opposition.
There ouht to be some conscience, some promotion of public
intelligence, even in the newspaper world. There ought to be
some respect for the chief executive of the nation even among
"copperhead" republicans. We do not preume to tell our
contemporary what it should regard as valuable, or valueless
news. That is a matter for their own estimation, but their es
timation in this case is too patently based upon what they re
gard as political expediency, permitting it to override every
vestige of patriotic or Americanized sense, to admit of any
other construction than an un-American poliiic.il cowardice.
Such lack of respect, of interest, of consideration for the
head of the nation, is a splendid example, isn't it, for a news

GE SUIT
Spectators in Court Room
Thrown Into Panic Broke
Up Her Home.
International News Serrig:
CHICAGO, Oct. IS. Spectators in
the court of Judge Foell were
thrown into a panic shortly before
noon today when a black-gowned,
heavily-veiled woman suddenly rose j
and fired three shots at Jacob Klaus,
seriously wounding him.
The woman was Mrs. Katherine
Marek, whose hufband was suinp;
her for divorce, naming Klaus. The
woman was juickly overpowered by
court attendants, but not before
there had been a general rush for
exists in which several persons were
seriously shaken up. Klaus is a
brother of a Chicago alderman.
Mrs. Marek held a baby in her
arms when she lired.
"Von will nof. try to ruin my home
again." she screamed as Klaus
tumrd to the floor.
"This man broke up my home,"
she told the police, without a trace
of emotion. "I had a nice home
four children. lie came to me and
won my love and then betrayed me.
I have lost my home, my children,
everything. So I shot him."
Marek accused Klaus of being the
man who wrecked his home in his
bill of complaint. Today Klaus was
to have taken the stand to testify
against her.
Two of the bullets hit Klaus. The
other buried itself in the judge's
bench and narrowly missed hitting
him.
APPEALS TO ENGLAND
International News Serviee:
PARIS. Oct. IS. An appeal to
England to save Roumania is made
by the newspaper Victoire. In dis
cussing the critical situation of the
Palkan kingdom the paper says that
England. with .strong forces in
Egypt, should not leave Roumania
in the lurch.
paper to set in the midst of its preaching of "Americanism ' to
the "new American," in a city in which the new American is
so numerous? For proof of its unprincipled, worse than
damnable hypocrisy, with respect to its "Americanism"
preaching, this action is sullicient to anyone save an equally
unprincipled republican bonehead.
"America first!" No, not with them. It is "republicanism
first, and republicanism always," that is their motto; let the
broader sentiments of Americanism, of respect for authority,
of a decent regard for men high in public life, be hanged.
Differing with a president's opinions and policies is one thing.
Attempting to crucify him by lies, misrepresentation and
calumny, and then because he don't down, bury him alive, is
quite another thing.
A president of the United States is deserving of the highest
respect, and his approach and presence deserve to be heralded,
out of respect for the nation, to inspire the young, encourage
patriotism, and make Americanism the more secure; this,
wherever he goes, and regardless of his political faith or breed
ing. . Even a candidate for president deserves a larger re
spect, for this same purpose, than our Main st. contemporary
in its narrow partisanship, has afforded the president. J.
Frank Manly, at the high school auditorium, last night, only
coming, was heralded more loudly, by our contemporary,
than is the coming of the president."
Perhaps it is not for us to say of our contemporary, but we
would say it of ourselves as well, that the newspaper which
through such an un-American partisanship, fails to fill its mis
sion in this regard; tilling it tor American patriotism's sake;
regardless of partisan expediences, say nothing of compara
tive news values, forfeits the respect of the community that it
serves. It is the next thing to gloating over the assassination
of a president, of whose opinions and policies it does not ap
prove. Perhaps that is putting it a trifle Marsh, but the dif
ference 'is one of degree and not of kind.
We call attention to the fact that when Mr. Mughes came
to South Bend, regardless of advertising ar.d editorial com
ment carried regarding his contentions or presence, the news
columns of The News-Times were wide open to tell of his
coming, and what was done while he stayed. And a similar
policy has been pursued with respect to every republican
speaker that has visited the city. They h:tve "had fair and
courteous treatment in the news columns, regardless of what
you may think of our editorial criticisms. News is news, and
the importance of news, from every standpoint save that of
our contemporary's is always measured b the prominence
of the parties involved, and comparative provable effect upon
the public mind.
Ai;d even our contemporary seems to have had a regard for
that measurement fearing the possible effect of tlie presence
of the presdent on its party's local destinies. Assured as we are
from the recent presence of former Progressive 'National
Chairman Dye, pleading almos; on his knees for a larger pro
gressive support even to the point of offering rewards, and
this supported by evasive admission from the local republican
chairman, that the party locally is skating on thin ice, it re
quires no occult power; to demonstrate wh:.t the republican
organ, in its excessive partisanship, is afraid cf.
Wall Street's Schemes For
Central Bank But Sleeping
Sec'y IVTAdoo Declares Jus
tice Hughes Would Have
Nothing to Do but
Repeal Acts.
CHICAGO, Oct. 18. William G.
McAdoo, secretary of the treasury,
today at nocn before a throng that
tilled Cohan's Grand opera house,
ripped into the wishy-washy stand
taken hy Mr. Justice Hughes in his
race for the presidency and branded
the former supreme court justice as
the candidate of Wall st. and all
that that implies with its aims to
undermine the llrm financial foun
dation upon which this government
nov stands as the result of legisla
tion brought about under Wood row
Wilson. .
The secretary was cheered time
and again as he asked what Mr. Jus
tice Hushes would do in regard to
the federal reserve law, the farm
loan law, and climaxed his charges
with the Roosevelt statement that
hewould haveeized German ships in
our waters when the Lusitania was
sunk. This, the secretary said, woul"
have meant war.
Mr. McAdoo pointed to the repub
lican platform as it touched the
farm loan lnv and said there is
nothing for Mr. Hughes to do if
elected but to repeal the act that

International News .Service:
WASHINGTON, Oct. IS. Reports
reached Washington today that Gen.
Trevino. commanding, the Carrnnza
garrison at Cnihuahua, had failed to
accept Francisco Villa's challenge to

lation as to whether Trevino still

snatches the farmer from the grasp
of the money shark or substitute
something else for it.
Wall st.'s schemes for a great cen
tral bank are hut sleeping, said th
secretary, and a central hank means
panics a.s in the old days lefore the
federal reserve act was enacted into
law. Mr. McAdoo quoted Rot t and
Rurton. former senators, and other
republican wheelhorscs who predict
ed panics if the act was made a law
and his sighting the fact that they
are very bad prophets brought wild
applause.
Sec'y McAdoo recalled how the
republicans in both house and senate
voted against the measure almost to
a man, and asked if the people were
again going to return t the Wall st.
regime after having once been freed
from it.
The American people, the secre
tary pointed out, are heintr asked to
put their peace and prosperity in
peril by electing an inexperienced
former supreme court justice. Mr.
McAdoo said the voters would not
forget the hand that was backing
him.
The secretary pointed to tlie
perils that even now best the gov
ernment and told how any wild man
could throw the country into war if
in the presidential chair. He point
ed to the diplomacy that had carried
thivs country safely through under
Wilson and then asked the women
in the audience what they thought
of war. . Here cheers again broke
out.
