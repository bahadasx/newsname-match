MR. LANSING IS OUT
FOR HALF HOLIDAY
Recommends Short Saturday
All Year in Report Sent
to President.
PRAISES HIS SUBORDINATES
Secretary Lansing has adopted the
recommendation of Chief Clerk Davis
of the Department of State In favor of
a half-day Saturday holiday all the
? year round, and has sent a report to
j that effect to the President at Shadow
Lawn.
\ The Secretary's letter was not made
j public, but it is understood he based
, his recommendation for the Saturday
half holiday, mainly on the erround that
| the clerks and messengers in the State
I Department were faithful and efficient
, and always met the frequent calls for
extra work after hours without com
plaint, and needed a short holiday once
a week, for recreation and health.
Secretaries Baker and Daniels are out
| of the city taking part in the political
campaign and have not yet replied to
the President's request for their views
on the advisability of applying the
legal half holiday in the District to
the War and Navy Departments
throughout the year.
But Two Dissenting Views.
In advance of the transmission yes- I
terday of Secretary McAdoo's letter to
the White House favoring the yearround
Saturday half holiday for federal
employes, evdfry bureau and division
chief of the Treasury Department.
save two, had gone on record as
favoring the half holiday extension,
-v The exceptions are the controller of the
w currency, John Skelton Williams, and the
director qf the mint, F. H. J. von Engelken.
Controller Williams does not favor
the ideai in view of the fact that he
has asked for additional clerks in the
estimates for this year, and that the
working time of his office would be reduced
7 per cent by the operation of a
year-round Saturday half holiday.
"I do not see how I could consistently
recommend the granting of the Saturday
half holiday," he says. "It seems
to me that seven hours a day, with a 1
half holiday, on Saturday for three ]
months in the summer, is not an un- |
in view of the numerous other holidays '
allowed during the year." 1
The director of the mint is opposed to ]
an extension of the Saturday half holidays
unless those who benefit thereby 1
compensate the government by making up. \
the time during the other days of the
week. He is conscientiously opposed to i
reducing the hours of labor of govern- i
inent clerks. He cites the long hours of i
labor that were exacted of him in the ]
past to establish a contention that the 1
k government clerks are most leniently
treated in this respect. 1
?
Favored by Twantj^terea. <
There are twenty-nine bureaus and dl- ]
visions of the Treasury Department. *
The other twenty-seven chiefs, or those I
acting for them in their absence, in- i
dorse the proposition, some with great J
enthusiasm. Most of them record that j
no further working force nor overtime .
will be required. Some of them expect
a great deal better work In exchange i
for the privilege. ;
- Some of them intimate that condi- ^
tions may arise where overtime will |
be necessary. Others speak of the pos- i
sibility of this condition, but state that '
it might occur at any time even were J
the all-year round Saturday half holidays
not in vogue. (
One of the most significant indorsements
is from Surgeon Gen. Blue of j
the public health service. He favors ,
the idea both from an administrative ,
and health standpoint, giving it scientific
and professional encouragement.
Wants Engraving Bureau Included.
Director Joseph E. Ralph of the bureau
of engraving and printing ex- 1
4:3U. as suggesiea oy uirecior naipn.
*a>s P. J. Ryan, editor of the Plate
. Printer.
Mr. Ryan declares that there are now
on the civil service register names of
numerous eligible plate printers and
other employes who could be taken on
by the bureau in case the Saturday half
holiday were granted, and thus obviate
the necessity of the present employes
working a half hour more each d*y.l
If
presses his hope that those employed i
under him will be given the benefit, of '
the half holiday. If granted generally, ]
this in spite of economic difficulties,
the prospect of reduced production or 1
h increased expense due to the fact that
the bureau is a manufacturing plant
on a different pay basis than are other
government offices.
"The employes of this bureau, in my
opinion," he comments, "are required
to perform more arduous duties than
In any of the clerical departments, and i
if the other branches of the government
are given these half holidays I
should certainly hope to have this bureau'included
within the order.
"The matter seems more particularly
to affect the employes of this bureau
"than it does the clerical branches of
1 the service, for the reason that nearly
1 all the male employes and a great
i many female employes are members of
labor organizations which have particularly
been appealing for tha half
holidays."
Director Ralph explains that the production
of the bureau will be curtailed
? to an amount of 13,205,000 sheets. To
. prov de for this he would regard it as
necessary to procure an additional appropriation
of J245.000 to employ addl11
nr\1 hpln nr to extend the work hours
of tfe other week days from 4 to 4:30
o'clock.
Commissioner Osborn's View.
"V i: further believed that additional
clerks will not be necessary on account
of 'he proposed change," adds Commissioner
W. H. Osborn of the bureau
of internal revenue to his indorsement,
"for the reason that the additional rest
^ granted and better spirit inspired will
tend to Increase the efficiency of the
' present organisation."
The attitude of the bureau and division
chiefs was obtained at the request
of the Secretary of the Treasury
in order to enable him intelligently
to form an opinion. Joseph L. Wilmeth.
chief clerk, assembled the data
and presented it in forin. Secretary
McAdoo's indorsement followed this
overwhelming sentiment in favor of
Saturday half holidays all year round.
SEES NO ADVANTAGE IN IT.
/
P. J. Ryan Opposes Director Ralph's
Half-Holiday Proposition.
There would be no advantage in giving
employes of the bureau of engraving
and printing a Saturday half holiday
ail the year round if the hours of
work were extended from 4 o'clock to
... . . . 4 . _ . .
which course of action would be an injustice
to employes of the bureau, Mr.
Ryan declares, and more than make up
for the half day itself.
Mr. Ryan says that Mr. Ralph, who
3'esterday said that uC'hile he was in favor
of the proposed holiday he did not
see how it could be granted at the bureau
without extending the hours of
work, or by getting an increased appropriation
for the bureau, should not
expect that the half holiday could be
granted without extra appropriations
for all the departments.

Gloomy Picture of Industry in
America After War Painted
by Railroad Man.
ADDRESSES MEETING HERE 1
A gloomy picture of business America 1
after the war in Europe is ended was
painted this morning at the opening <
session of the convention of the Society i
of Railway Financial Officers, at the 1
Raleigh Hotel. T. H. B. McKnight, treas- i
urer of the Pennsylvania railroad lines ]
west, in his annual report, which he read i
to the treasurers and other high financial ]
officials of almost all the railroads in ,
the country who were present, predicted
that manufacturing will be i
halted or greatly lessened, with a con- *
sequent heavy falling off in railroad J
freight earnings; that immigration i
from Europe will be prevented, with a *
consequent increase in the price of ?
labor, and that because Europe will
want so much money with which to re- 2
habilitate the belligerent countries J
there will be practically none left for
the development of American railroads (
except at prohibitive loan rates. t
"With the regulation of railroad
freight rates down," Mr. McKnight
said, "and with wage increases made
by congressional enactment"?in allusion
to the so-called Adamson "eight- ^
hour law" recently passed by Congress
?"who will feel like trying to develop t
the American railroads, the mainstay r
of commerce?" n
B-ii ? ?? *
wuoiuci Moiuvau nuuieiliS.
S
The financial officers of the railroads e
gathered at the Raleigh to take up the v
problems that confront them, with ?
great enthusiasm, singing "America" t
at the top of their voices as the opening fl
Incident of the convention. They departed
from previous custom by a reso- *
lution of the executive committee inciting
newspaper correspondents to be
present at their deliberations, and it D
was announced that the presidents of v
the Washington banks will be Invited d
to take part in the convention Friday tj
morning, when Frank A. Vanderlip,
president of the National City Bank of j,
New York, will address the convention. n
The convention was welcomed to t]
Washington by Oliver P. Newman, a
chairman of the board of Commissioners
of the District of Columbia, who
old something of the origin of the
District government, and In response to
i request to explain why it is that
smokestacks obscure the view of the
Washington Monument, he explained 01
vhy it is that the federal government ei
must observe the rights of owners of cj
private property, notwithstanding the ti
Tact that the federal government is c(
paramount here. 1
"I understand you are governed like
Elussians;" Mr. McKnight said to Mr. el
Newman, in introducing him; "that ir
you have no vote, no common council, C1
Put that you pay taxes." When Mr. 5(
Newman told the convention that the w
people of the country are the real ^
rwnej*s of Washington, and pay half
>f Washington's taxe's, describing the {b,
;ity as "Your capital," Mr. McKnight itl
promised that the members of the so- j
piety would take a more personal in- t.
terest in Washington now that they ] ^
know that they help to pay taxes here.
Guests at Beception Tonight. ^
E. C. Brandenburg, president of the
Washington Board of Trade, addressed
the convention this afternoon, and
shortly thereafter pleasure parties for
sightseeing, etc., were made up. To- ai
night the members of the convention, b
who have brought their families to c,
Washington, will be guests at a re- a
ception of H. C. Ansley, treasurer of fl
the Southern railway, and Mrs. Ansley 0
at their home, 2627 Connecticut avenue. a
During Mr. McKnlght's address he a
pointed out that he does not believe tj
that the governments of Europe will |
allow immigration after the war. The jrj
men, he said, will be needed to rehabil- ^
itate?to rebuild?Europe. J
"There will be a great dearth of un-jp
skilled labor here, and we will have to
pay more for it. It may even turn out j ^
that we shall have to do as Europe is i tj
doing, employ women in the men's ! ^
trades. That will mean that the washing
and cooking will be put out of the
house, and that we shall have more
and more community living," Mr. Mc- f
Knight said. He continued, in part: I
Much Money Will Be Needed. *
"Great sums of money will be required
abroad. Great sums will be required
here, too. The United States
fovernment must put out bonds to pay
or preparedness, and they must be absorbed.
In no other country in the
world except the United States is there ?
money to lend. When the munition
business is over we will find the American
railroads bidding against foreign
governments for money. The railroads
have not been able to finance their
business for the past ten years, and |
many floating loans must be taken care j
of. Improvements are badly needed by
the railroads, extensions are badly
needed. Where is the money to come
from?" C
Mr. McKnight advocated universal
military Instruction on the Swiss or 8
Australian system, and declared that i h
"the people of the United States are
living in a fool's paradise." so far as
possible attack by foreign govern- c
ments is concerned. The whole tenor
of his address was the necessity for r
increased industrial, financial and military
preparedness.

FAMOUS AVIATOR WOTJHDED.
Capt. Boelke Had Brought Down
Many Entente Aeroplanes.
PARIS, October 18.?The newspaper

severely wounded, by a shell from a
French anti-aircraft gun. On October
8 Boelke brought down his thirtieth

FLOUR TAKES RISE;.
NOW SJ2ABARREL
Advance Follows Wheat's Sensational
Jump ih Chicago
Yesterday.
NO RELIEF IS IN SIGHT NOW
The price of flour, for several weeks
higher than at any time since the civil
war. advancer! again today in varying
figures, ranging from 25 cents to 50
cents per barrel, putting the cost to the
householder in the neighborhood of $12
i barrel.
This advance, flashed by wire to growers,
both wholesale and retail, followed
in exciting session yesterday in the
Chicago wheat pit, where the grain itself
advanced from 5 to 7% cents a
bushel.
Although news from the big milling
centers seems to indicate that there is
i fairly labge supply of flour in sight,
:he men in the trade covered themselves
from possible loss by immediately
advancing the price of flour to
wholesalers, and in most instances it
ivas discovered today that the retail
auyer will soon begin to pay the advance,
if not today.
One of the biggest grocery concerns
n the District of Columbia received tolay
a notice of an advance in price of
10 cents a barrel for the best grade
Minnesota flour, putting the scheduled
>rice today at $10.25 a barrel wholesale
tnd $10.55 a barrel retail at that paricular
establishment. The manager
laid that he had on hand a supply
which would be sold to his customers
it the old rate, but that the advance
nust be paid for by buyers as soon as
he old supply is exhausted.
Other dealers quoted flour of differ;nt
grades from $10 to $12 a barrel
his morning.
High Prices Here to Stay.
"The high prices of flour are here
o stay for a time," said P. T. Moran
oday, as he opened telegrams giving
lotice of the flour advance, "and I do
ot expect any material reduction from
he present levels until this country
ees a big crop of wheat and we quit
ndeavoring to feed all the rest of the
irorld and ourselves at the same time
n a short crop. From the knowl
Uge Ul LUC UU31UGDO a ua.v, ?
0 me that we will have these high
our prices for about a year at least."
Philip M. McKim, manager of a large
rocery establishment, predicts a sim!ar
situation:
"The only chance we have for a reuction
from present levels in flour
rices," he said, "is to get Russian
rheat through the Dardanelles, and I
on't see any possibility there at this
1 me."
"There isn't enough wheat and flour
1 this country for domestic requirelents,"
said R. B. Earnshaw, "and un1
we get enough we will have to pay
big price for it."
Cheaper Ocean Freight Bates.
The occurrence which sent wheat
>aring in Chicago yesterday was based
i the statement that the British gov nment
is making strenuous efforts to
leapen the cost of ocean transportaon
of gain, so as to benefit English
msumers. Transactions amounting to
500,000 bushels ran the price up.
The British government has taken
itire charge of the business of importig
wheat for England, and has already
it the ocean freight rates to less than (
) per cent of what they were a few
eeks ago. On that basis news from '
hicago says that in addition to the big I
salings yesterday more than 2,000,000 ,
ushels of winter wheat have been con acted
for. '
However, reports .from milling cen- <
>rs, where the manufactured flour is (
ealt in. indicate that there is a suply
of generous proportions on hand '
rid that millers are simply covering '
lemselves because of the mercurial i
>mperament of the wheat pit. ^
Price of Bread May Go Up.
Although there are no indications of 1
ny immediate advance in the price of 1
read to the people of the District in
snsequence of today's sharp advance !
nd the rather steady recent rise of i
our, those familiar with the problems
f the retail bakers here and elsewhere '
dmit that their difficulties in obtaining J
fair profit have grown steadily since '
he outbreak of the war. ,
The last three months, especially, are !
eKerihwt as "a erueial neriod" for tho 1
akers and one that calls for every 1
racticable economy. It would appear j
robable. therefore, unless new econ- j
mies are devised and operated for the
eneflt of both retailer and consumer,
fiat Washingtonians may eventually <
ave to share the increasing: burden of <
ost with their bakers.

ipeaker Clark Describes National
Contest as a "Horse Race"?State
Result Doubtful.
? j
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
ST. LOUIS. October 18.?Speaker i |
lhamp Clark has a homely way of de- 1
crlbing things, a kind of a broad- 1
rimmed Missouri way. He says that
he national election is a horse race. It
ertainly is a horse race In this state.
A man would be foolish to bet his 1
noney on Missouri at this time. Nornally
democratic, sometimes republt-i
an, the outcome now depends upon the j
lerman vote. And how is the German |'
joipg to vote? Four weeks ago he was |'
o vote for Hushes, now he Is switch- i
ng. He thinks President Wilson is no*
luch a bad man, after all.
One can feel it in the air all through
his region. .From Milwaukee down
hrough Chicago to this town a portion of
he German vote is swinging to Wilson,
iow much? That is the question. And
vho can answer it when dealing with ,
i temperamental race?
The Germans in the west are as highitrung
as a guitar string. Col. Roosevelt's
recent utterances struck a dis:ordant
note. Nobody knows how the
jtate is going. They will tell >you here
hat the republican candidate for gov;rnor
will win, that Wilson will get the
lectoral vote and that Senator Reed is
ifrald for his life that Mr. Dickey will
>eat him. But Senator Stone and Speakir
Clark and Mr. Niedringhaus will adnit
to you In a burst of confidence,
vhile smoking a cigar in a removed
sorner of the lobby of the hotel, that it
s a "horse race."
So let's leave it open until Mister
German Voter decides what he is going
o do.

tober 18.?After the demonstration ii
here against the entente allies, during A
which a procession of several thousand c
persons marched to the American lega- 0
tion and protested against the landing ii
of French marines, a delegation of six
persons called at the American lega- gl
tion and presented resolutions asking e
the sympathy and protection of the G
United States against the encroachments
of the entente powers. The
spokesman said in English, in present- ing
the resolution: j I
"Henry Clay's speech in regard to J a
Greece's struggle for liberty, as well as
one by Daniel Webster, said the struggle
would have been made meaningless
If the liberties of Greece had been subsequently
lost."
Petition to Be Forwarded.
The American minister, Garrett Droppers,
promised to forward the petition
to Washington. ?
On the initiative of the central em- ?
pires Washington has been asked to ^
permit the American legation here to
take charge of Austrian, Bulgarian and
Turkish interests in case of a declaration
of war by Greece or other com- 8
plications. Permission has been given ^
as regards Austria. ^
The British legation explains that the
landing of marines at Athens and
Piraeus was merely intended to reinforce?
the police. It is generally
thought, however, that this action was f
taken to prevent demonstrations like
those of yesterday. ta

DISCUSSES RESERVE ACT I
By the Associated Press.
CHICAGO, October 18.?Praise for
'resident Wilson's diplomatic and leg- 1
siative achievements. and'charsres that 1
'Wall street has always dominated the 2
epublican party" and that victory *or c
hat party next month would endanger (
he country's prosperity were voiced i
lere today by William G. McAdoo, Sec- t
etary of the Treasury, before a noon I
>olitical meeting* in a downtown the- t
iter.
"The American people are being ask- i
sd to put in peril the peace and pros- f
>erity the country is now enjoying un- t
ler President \yilson by turning their c
government over to the inexperienced i
dr. Hughes and the organized band of <
ncomparible elements which are sup- <
jorting him," said Mr. McAdoo. <
"For two months they, have con- ?
lemned every act of the democratic ad- 2
ninistration in the most unfair and un- J
ruthful manner, but the American peo>le
are still without a definite answer
!rom Mr. Hughes as to what they will
lo with the government if they get
>ossession of it.
Act Would Have Meant War.
"The only definite thing we have had
n the campaign came from Col. Roosevelt,
who said at Battle Creek, discussng
the Lusitania: 'You ask me what I
vould have done. I would have seized
svery interned German ship.' "
Mr. McAdoo then quoted Germany's
leclaration of war on Portugal because 1
>f seizures of German ships by that <
country, and added: 1
"Mr. Roosevelt's action would have ;
resulted in war between the United
States and Germany. .. And now comes ;
Mr. Hughes and admits, as far as he is
aver definite, his accord with the bellicose
attitude of Mr. Roosevelt. This is
shown by his reply at Louisville to the
question as to what he would have
ione in the Lusitania case. He said, in
3ubstance, that he would have threatsned
the kaiser so effectively that 'the
Lusitania would never have been sunk.'
rhis is characteristic evasion, for Mr.
Hughes was asked what he would have
lone after the Lusitania had been
?unk. I challenge him to answer that
question.
Predicts Colonel Dominating Factor.
"Who can doubt that If Mr. Hughes
is made President Mr. Roosevelt will
be the dominating influence and direct
foreign and domestic policies?
"A President has it in his power to
plunge the country into war at any
noment. A single misstep, or rash act,
>r blunder on his part is all that is
lecessary. It does not require courage
:>r statesmanship to provoke war. Any
ivild man or blundere** in the presilential
chair can precipitate such a
lalamity."
Taking up domestic affairs. Mr. Mc\doo
said that the democratic adminstration
had destroyed the system by
nrhich "the reserve money of the banks
pf the country was concentrated prinpi
pally in New York city." He believed
:hat Mr. Hughes "if elected intends to
epeal the federal reserve act" and es:ablish
a antral hank, because the republican
party has always stood for
Wall street and a central bank.
Demand of Wall Street.
"The demand of Wall street for a
jentral bank will be gratified if the
epubiicans regain control of the government,"
he added. The Secretary
laid that if Mr. Hughes "stands by his 1
>arty platform he must either repeal
>r substitute something for the farm
oan law."
He argued "that the Roosevelt panic
>f 1907, the worst in our history, is
inclusive proof of republican incom- 1
>etence," and added that "our virile, .
ich, unmaimed and highly developed
>eople" need fear nothing from "the \
jompetition of stricken and broken '*
Curope" after the war.
He continued that if even we are en- 1
[angered the creation of * a non- 1
artisan tariff board and the enact- *
nent of anti-dumping and unfair com- 1
ctition laws by the democratic Con- 8
rress have already provided means to ^
protect every legitimate interest a
.gainst hurtfyl combinations against t

Hughes Heckled in Iowa;
Denies He Is Sponsor for
Invisible Government
SIOUX CITY. Iowa, October 18 ?
Charles E. Hughes, facing a friendly
audience sprinkled with hecklers, last
night replied, in answer to a question
as to whether he would repeal the
Adamson law if elected President, that
"a surrender could not be repealed."
Mr. Hughes was asked what he would
have done to avert the threatened railroad
strike.
"If arbitration had been refused," Mr.
Hughes replied, "I should have gone
right to the American people, stated
the facts, and put the responsibility
where it belonged.
"I should at the same time," Mr.
Hughes said, "have secured a commission
of inquiry so impartial, so fair, as
to command the respect of the entire
country, and directing public opinion
to that end, there is no group of men
in the United States that would have,
dared hold up the instrumentalities of
commerce if that were done.
The man still had another question
to ask.
Says Crisis Was Unnecessary.
"Mr. Hughes," he said, "any question #
that is asked here is asked with no enmity
toward the candidate of the republican
party. You would have done
ill that within twenty-four hours?'
"Why. sir," the nominee replied, "the
pusiness men of the United States
hrough the Chamber of Commerce ol
he United States on Julv 2d sent m
elegram to the President asking for
in Inquiry. A resolution was introluced
in the Senate for an inquiry
nd was laid on the table. For months
he business men of the United States
.sked for an inquiry as to this very
natter, and the crisis was allowed to
e developed when it was unnecessary
hat it should have been developed and
here was adequate time to ascertain
/hat. the facts were."
Utmost Confusion Reigns.
The questioning was attended by the
tmost confusion. The audience which
ad cheered and applauded loudly in
he earlier parts of Mr. Hughes' adress
apparently was incensed at the
iterruptions, and there were many
ries of "Put him out," "Sit down," and
Shut up." As the nominee replied to
ach question the audience cheered its
pproval. It was necessary after each
itecruption for Mr. Hughes to step
)rward and request that the quesoner
be allowed to proceed.
A man with a big stick in the galtry
sought to heckle the nominee 011
ibor affairs earlier in the evening. He
sked a question that apparently was
lisunderstood in the confusion and

When the applause died-the
an arose again. The crowd would
ive put him out and for more than
minute the audience was a tumult of
nfusion. Mr. Hughes with outretched
hands sought to quiet the
-ow'd. He finally made himself
sard.
"Let the gentleman, ask any question
i wants to," the nominee said. "What
> you want to say?"
Among hisses and boos the man ask1
his question, waving the stick in his
ind.
"Evidently, according to what you
tve said." the man began, "the labor
ild has taken you from the bench and
it you up as their standard bearer. Is
at right?"
There were cries of *'No! no!" and
>ut him out." It was some time bere
Mr. Hughes could make himself
ard.
Desires to Serve Whole People.
"One moment," the nominee shouted
the crowd, "one moment, please."
hen some sort of order was restored
b nominee went on. "I am not here,
, as the standard bearer of any one
oup or set, but desirous to serve the
