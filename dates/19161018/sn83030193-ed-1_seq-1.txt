Gaetano Montemagno. the youthful
bootblack who Is under sentence to

to-rday to the story he told yesterday
to Assistant District Attorney llroth
ers In tho trlul of former Deputy

Michael A. Rofruno for Inspiring tho

Montemngno resisted with a dogged
patlenco tho efforts of Martin W. Lit
tleton to cause him to contradict his
direct charges that Rofrano not only
paid him tu kill Oalmarl, but threat
ened him with Instant death If ho did
not tflre tho fatal shot when signalled
to by another of Rofrano's lieuten
ants. The witness took full ndvantngo of
tho delays caused by tho florid lan
uago used by tho Interpreter In put
ting his briefly snapped answors into
Enllsh. Thus ho kept cool and held
his temper when Mr. Littleton triad
to anger him Into Incautious speech.
In not a single incident of his nar
rative about his first Introduction to
Rofrano at tho Homo Rulo Club,
which was tho centro of the revolt
against former Sheriff Foley In tho
Second Assembly District, did Mon
temngno change his story; ho didn't
mind In tho least, apparently, ac

red In un underworld love nffalr and
$300 moro as expenso money In bring
Ing thugs from Hrooklyn to terrorize
the district on Primary Day with
an incidental promlsa "to stab some
body" and went philandering with
tho money instead of doing the things
for which he won paid.
In his bootblack days Montemagno
could not have smiled away the bad
gering of an Impatient patron more
cheerfully than he took the sharp
prodding of Rofrano's lawyer.
