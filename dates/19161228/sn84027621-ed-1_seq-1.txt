THE PEOPLE OF JACKSON
The Jackson Clarion-Ledger has the
following about the performance , of
Coburn's minstrels, who will be at
the Temple tomorrow night: ,
Coburn's Greater Minstrels enter
tained a good-sized audience at the
Century last night, and judging by
the applause and encores, the show
was greatly enjoyed, many of, the
musicians and actors being compell
ed to respond several times.
All the good singers are introduced
ifi the first part, the. second part be
ing an olio of many vaudeville acts,
and some of them, very good.
The first act represents a scene in
TtrncL India, at the palace of the
rajah, the scenery being very fine
Tha minstrels represent members of
the Millionaire Hunting Club of Am
erica, giving their songs and acts in
the presence of the rajah and his
queen, Lester Lucas, with his fine
hnsso voice, doincr the Dart of the
rajah, the " interlocutor. The other
singers are Frank Melville, Harry
Ford, Earl Rowland, Charles Cam
eron, Charles Vermont, Tom Post,
Ed Clifford and Charlie Gano.
Charlie Gano is the real life of the
show. He is not so long on singing,
but he is a fine talker and a superb
actor, reminding one somewhat of the
late George Wilson, in manner and
dress a comedian of the upper class
. and one that always makes a laugh.
whether talking or acting. His trick
mule act was a genuine laugh-pro
ducer.
The contortionist, Harry Toledo,
was good in his part!, which was to
bend and double himself up into all
sorts of shapes, impersonating the
Marvebua Mcphisto. The jokes were
good, clean and new.
The three musical Cates on Saxa-
phones, clarinets, cornets and other
instruments, appealed especially to
those of refined musical taste, being
unexcelled.
The singing of "Mississippi," by
the musical quartette, led by Ed Clif
ford, ths song adopted by the Fed
eration of Woman's Clubs at Green
wood, proved a pleasing event of the
long program. . '
In Charlie Gano's preparedness
skit, Charlie was the largest part, in
which all the company were introduc
ed, the grand finale being very pleas
ing. The song, "When I Get Back to
the United States," by Ed Clifford and
full chorus, closed the entertainment.

Newspapers have been flooded with

The suggestion of the government
to raise the dog tax from $1.50 to $5
is one of the proposed steps to "re
duce the dogs." But it is pointed out
that the breeder and well-to-do owner
will not be deterred by an increased
tax. v In favor of the dogs, it is de
clared, that dogs were never more
useful than today. The head of a
