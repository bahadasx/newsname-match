GERMANY'S REPLY HAS
WASHINGTON. Dec. 28. The Ger
man reply was received today. It to
said to be identical in essentials with
the presj version.
Secretary Lansing provided that
copies of the note be sent Wilson. He
had purposely avoided study of the
rote as contained In press reports
so as to keep his mind cler that the
points made by Germany would not
be confused with possible mlstate
ments of the press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28. Austria's
reply, which is similar to Germany's
reached the state department this
afternoon.
A man must be in business with an
other man or married to a woman In
order to discover that he doesn't
know them.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2S There is
growing belief here that Carranza has
not signed the protocol but instead
will submit counter proposals. The
belief even grew in official circles
where it was thought at first Carran
za would SiKn the protocol.

LONUOX, Dec 2S. The dispatch

phraseology is Identical, with the note
to the entente nations.
From authentic sources the United
Press learns the allied note will con
tain the rejection of peace as based

There is a vigorously worded sum

To remove the menace of militarism

probably make clear their alms by a
recital of the crimes which they pro
