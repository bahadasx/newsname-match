largest trade last week of any week

in a substantial, conservative way, as
it has never done before. Stop your

The deserving poor of Mexico and
the King's Daughters Home for Aged
Women and the Mexico Hospital
were well remembered Christmas Day
by the Social Service Association. All
had dinners in large liberally filled
baskets. The work was under the
superintendency of Hiss Cordelia
Ranz, the Social Service worker em
ployed here and no one deserving at
tention was overlooked.
A report of the Christmas Day work
fallows:
Families supplied with dinners by
Sunday School classes: Methodist,
three; Presbyterian, four; Christian,
six; Baptist, six.
A bountiful dinner was provided the
matron and ladies of the King'i
Daughters' Home by Mrs. J. R. Jes
se's Sunday School Gass of the Bap
tist Church, Mrs. Fred Howe, Mr. Ross
Wagner, and The Federated Clubs.
A small Christmas tree was prettily
decorated and a gift was given each
lady of the Home by Mrs. Maurice
Phillip, who also delivered the eat
ables and tree Sunday afternoon,
She was accompanied by Mrs. Turley,
who entertained the ladies with a
reading; Pauline and Flavius Collins
sang a duet, and Elizabeth
Squires, who sang a solo. Talbot
Harper and Harper Shouse called to
represent their Sunday School class.
Miss Hattie Kennan's Sunday School
Class of the Baptist Church had the
pleasure of providing dinner for the
Superintendent and nurses of our
Hospital. Six members of the class
presented in person the dinner and a
small decorated tree Sunday after,
noon.
The committee supplied three fami
lies, a member delivering one cooked
dinner in person, and reported a pleas

member has expressed real joy in hav

this time.
' In all twenty-three families were

Christmas Entertainments.
The Presbyterian, Christian, Bap.
tist and Methodist Churches held
Whito Christmas exercises Sunday
evening. All had beautiful programs
and each house of worship was crowd
ed to capacity with parents and chil
dren.
The Elks' Charity Christmas Tree
was held Sunday evening at the Home.
Over 275 children were given toys
and candy. The building was crowded
beyond capacity before the hour of
beginning and the final rush was so
great the toys lasted but a few min
utes and more toys had to be secur
ed to supply the waiting children. The
affair was a great success.
The south end of the Mexico and
Santa Fe electric line, which has
steel laid for four miles, is for sale.
Judge W. W. Botts, of the Mexico A
Santa Fe road, says a buyer is being
sought who will continue the southern
extension as well as give service over
it at once. As it stands, without con
nection with the northern extension,
it would prove too expensive to main
tain service on it for the present own.
ers.
Several have been here inspecting
the line. If a buyer cannot be found
who will operate the line and extend
it, the equipment already installed
May be junked and sold. The copper
trolley wire, some of which was stolen
by the famous Lewis Bros., is worth
today more as junk than it was when
purchased by the company new.
The fact there is no connecting
link between the two ends of the line
has made the southern end a com
plete loss under the present arrange
ments. Judge Botts Bays nothing de
finite has been done regarding the dis
posal of the southern section, except
offer it for sale.

SKINER ITEMS.
Most all of our farmers have fin
ished binning their com this season.
The yield was light; the quality good,
likewise, the price is. high. As beau
tiful a fall as the most exacting could
ask. Old Dina has yielded his ef
fulgent beauty almost daily; plenty
of moisture to keep the air balmy,
and bounteous enough crop to keep
the wolf from the door of all our farm
ers, making numerous houyant spirits
to waft us into one of the most de
lightful Xmases that time has
known. So we chose at inis lime ui
extend to our editors and asociates
and all our readers and friends the
heartfelt wish of the most joyous
Christmas time and New Year greet
ings ever extant. Jim Payne, young
est son of Mr. and Mrs. O. F. Ellis,
was in the Meyico Hospital last week
nnrl underwent an operation that
proved most successful. Drs. Gibbs
and Harrison did the operating. The
rabbit hunt pulled ofT here Thursday
was a rather joyous affair. Twenty
of our boys and men carried their guns
from morning until night They suc
ceeded in bagging an average of 20
taniece or 400 bunnies. There were
v r
really about 60 to hafe participated,
and but for 8 below zero weather
and divers other causes only the above
number partook of the joyousness of
the day. There were two sides, of
course, the losers to put up an oyster
supper some night this week. John
JoneB has rented a 360-acre farm near
Clark, Randolph County, from his
cousin, Walter Ridgeway, who is the
editor of a Fayette paper. All John's
friends here think he has a good lay.
Here's hoping him unbounded suc
cess in his new venture, but sorry
indeed to have him and his excellent
family depart from our midst.
Elmer Conley continues to work on his
new barn, which will certainly be a
dandy when completed. W. Rivisdon
has just about completed his second
barn this fall. His big barn burned
down in the summer and he has built
two handy sized ones in its stead.
John Styles and wife left for sunny
Colorado, recently, to make their
home. Mrs. Styles' parents moved
there last fall for her mother's health,
and are liking it very much. This left
Elmer Gatewood in a tight place for a
while, for he nver had o much to
do since he was bom arid nobody to
do it except his little self. Elmer will
come through no matter in what tight
places he may be placed. Misses Ruth
Ellis and Hazel Halloway, of Hardin,
are home to spend the holidays. Cap
tain Nolan V. Ellis, of Fort Sam Hous
ton, was here last week, the guest of
his kinfolks, the Elises. Nolan looks
fine and came to his present place of
elevation from a private at $13
month in 1898, to $260 a month and
traveling expenses. He's one of our
boys who has kept hammering and
only two years ago took unto himself
a better half, which accounts largely
for good looks and fine deportment.
Here's hoping he reaches the highest
generalship in the army. Mrs. Bur
net entertained her boys and daughters
Sunday with a turkey diner. Two
20-pound turkeys were killed for the
occasion. Boys and girls, it is cer
tainly fine to have a god mother, for
she's always doing kindly deeds, work
ing for you incessantly (perhaps not
noticed by you so much), so appreciate
her yhile you may, and gladden her
great heart with exuberant joy. Mr.
and Mrs. W. F. Wilfley entertained
at turkey dinner Monday Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. Ray
Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. R. T. Baker, Mr.
and Mrs. Geo. Neale, and the scribe,
to the most toothsome spread it has
been our lot to partake of for a num
ber of moons. Mrs. Wilfley has the
culinary art down fine and has cer
tainly taught the same to her daugh
ters, the Mistresses Baker and Roy
Bruce. It is certainly a grand privi
lege to have the honor to partake of
such a good dinner. The Christmas
tree at the Ladies' Hall Saturday
night was largely attended. Many
nice presents, a fine crowd and a good
time were had by all present. The
Christmas program and tree given by
Miss Mildred Cook and pupils at Gate
wod Friday evening was very fine.
Every number was rendered in a pro
ficient manner and old Santa, with
his Christmas tree lent great mirth
to the little tote and grown up ones,
too, for that matter, Rev. Fred White
filled his regular appointment at Beth
lehem Saturday and Suriday. The
Christmas program and tree at Duey
Friday night last, by Misses Bessie
Day and her school, was a very pleas
ing affair. Every number was very
artfully arranged and was rendered
tasteful manner. The little fel
lows held their breath expecting old
Santa, where finally he appeared in an
auto and had the veil lifted from the
tree, and delivered the presents to the
various little ones and grownups.
Lest we forget again we shall chron
icle now the marriage of four of our
very excellent young people. First
that of David Zook and MiBS Orpha
Hall. They had been sweethearts for
6 or 8 years and finally took a notion
to work a trick on their parents and
friends when by previous arrange
ments they sped away to Fulton and
were happily pronounced husband and
wife. They would have worked it
for a week or two more but for the
school teacher of the bride's own
dis'rict, who happened to be on the
train, and who very naturally appre
hended their intent. There are lots
of ways these little things irork and
two just alike. Cupid suits
the fancy of one couple to try
it one way, and the fancy of another
another, and so on. They will live on
a farm southwest of Thompson. Dav
made us an ideal citizen here the
past year, excepting, of course, he
was a bachelor, DUt couian I ao any
better, he said, until she finally y'eld
ed to his tender entreaties. The sec
ond marriage was that of Clyde Weav
er and Misse Gertie Graybeal of Kan
sas City. Mrs. Weaver is a trained
nurse, a woman of exceptional ability
and presentment in her field and

The entertainment and Christmas
I tree at Central Friday was very good
and largely attended. Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Pickett came up from Colum
bia Friday and dined at Mr. and Mrs.
W .H. DeJarnett's Saturday and Sun
day at Judge and Mrs. Henry Spurl-
ine's. C. M. Berrey got out three
loads of cattle last week ,two of rough
cattle and one of calves, bringing
around the $9 per cwt mark. The
big rough cattle weighed 1600 lbs. or
better. Mr. Berrey has over hun
dred fine fat porkers ready to go any
time he chooses. The cattle fed
made good money as they were the
kind, the cost price was low, and when
the porkers go will roll up s handsome
profit still. Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Spurt

NOTHING HEARD FROM
WUIU F. ATKH
No word has been heard from W. F.
Atkinson, who left Mexico for St
Louis month ago, since he checked
out at the Planters Hotel a few days
later. It was first thought that Mr.
Atkinson had been killed and robbed
on account of valuable diamonds which
he wore. The police of St Louis took
the matter up and ao far as they could
learn, Mr. Atkinson left St Louis on a
business trip to Texas, since which
time nothing has been heard from
him. .','
1 Mr. Atkinson's creditors are ad
vertising his properties for sale under
deeds of trust, and a trustee in bank
ruptcy has been appointed for his es
tate. In view of the condition of Mr.
Atkinson's affairs, it seems now as
I though he might not have met with
any foul play, but is staying away
of hia own accord. The whole matter
is most deplorable, as Mr. Atkinson
was one of Mexico's most progressive
and active young business men.
It is to be hoped that his business
affairs are not in as bad shape as is
currently reported. Claims are being
made that tome of his transactions
were irregular or at least unique,
and it would seem as though if he
were here many of them could be ex
plained and probably straightened
out
