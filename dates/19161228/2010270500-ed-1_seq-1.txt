Reduce your Tire Expense from 50 to 75
Other autoiata profit by this economy, why shouldnt you. Bring
me your old tires and I will save you some money.
We mean by C-W Rebuilt Tires, that for each pair of old tires you
sent us, we manufacture for you a tire not duplicated on the market.
Through our process of selecting, tearing down and steam vulcan
izing together, we have,added from one-third to one-half more material
and strength than your tire originally had.
The tread will be much heavier, giving greater resistance against
puncture; the side walls much thicker, eliminating rim cuts and blow
outs; practically getting away from these dreaded defects you have
experienced in tires in the past.
Do not confuse our process of rebuilding with the old manner of
sewing or riveting two old tires together. We rebuild by factory
process,
We do all kinds of tire and tube repairing in addition to building
tires. If your work has not been satisfactory in price or workman
ship, send it to us we absolutely guarantee first-clas3 work.

character, having been under the
government's s61icitouscare on sev

broke jail at Emerson and was ab
sent from the town for some time.
It was an open secret that he was
suspected of illicit liquor trade but
it seemed impossible to get sufliciont

charge which has been placed

his wife's money. Ho married a
half breed Indian girl.
Sioux City Journal, 27th: Police
officers in New Mexico who have
been searching for the travelingcom
panion of Clyde D. Armour, of Sioux
City, both of whom mysteriously dis
appeared in New Mexico while en
route to California in Armour's mo
tor car two months ago, believe the
stranger was E. W. Blaucett. Ar
mour disappeared in New Mexico
and the traveling compar. - lrter
soiu tne car in Albuquerque uiiu pro
cured funds from relative of Arm
our and also from the Liou.t City
Gas and Electric company, which
firm employed Armour previous to
his making the trip. Mrs. Roy Ar
mour, sister-in-law oi tne missing
man, who lives near Hubbard, Neb.,
said-last night she expected her hus
band to return from New Mexico
shortly. 'Glen Armour, another bro
ther, who also lives near Hubbard,
has been assisting in the search, and
also is expected to return soon.
Blaucett, using the name of Armour,
obtained $150 from relatives in
Fresno, Cal., and wired to the Sioux
City Gas and Electric company on
two occasions for $200. As Armour
held a note for that amount, the
money was wired as requested. The
automobile was sold far $500. Sev
eral guns, a camera, blankets and
other articles in the car also were
sold by Blaucett. The investigation
of Glen and Roy Armour and their
brother-in-law, M. L. Sawyer, which
has been conducted for nearly two
months, showed that Blaucett imper
sonated Clyde Armour and attempted
to imitate his handwriting in send
ing telegrams. Blaucett was a free
spender in Albuqerque, and was seen
frequently with women and frequent
ed saloons, reports from Now Mex
ico state. Blaucett was traced to
Needles, Ariz., and it was apparent
that ho continued to some point in
California.
Iowa to the Nebraska side, officials
of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapo
lis and Omaha railroad virtually up
held the contention of South Sioux
City declared Ed Metz, acting mayor
of the Nebraska town, yesterday.
"That is just what we have been
arguing'" said the acting mayor,
"and now the road officials have ad
mitted it."
Citizens of South Sioux City can
see no way in which the change has
worked a benefit except to the rail
road, Acting Mayor Metz said. Only
two westbound and one eastbound
trains of the Nebraska division now
stop at South Sioux City. The West
bound train necessitates long lay
overs at Emerson for passengers des
tined for Norfolk and other points,
he said.
W. V. Steuteville, formerly city
attorney of South Sioux City, said
the admission of the railroad officials
before the commission would appear
.on the face of it a clear admission of
all the Nebraska protesters have
been contending. Attorney Steute
ville said, however, that it might bo
possible for the roads to make a
showing before the commission that
South Sioux City and the other
towns making protest are receiving
as good service in other towns of
equal size and, consequently, as
good servico as they are entitled to
receive.
Otherwise, Mr. Steuteville said,
he could see little reason to antici
pate an adverse ruling for the affect
ed towns at the hands of the commission.

Sioux City Journal, 22: Born in
Sioux City, la., Wednesday, Decem
ber 20, 1916, to Mr. and Mrs. Jess
Teller, McCook, S. D., a son.... Ice
cutting will begin at Crystal lake,
Neb., this morning at 7 o'clock, it
has been announced by Julius A.
Malory, of the Consumers' Ice com
pany. About Mi) men win ue em
ployed for a period of from five to
six- weeks. Many of the laborers
will live at the lake during the har
vest season Confident that a
ruling favorable to South Sioux
City, Neb,, and other towns affected
by a recent nonstop order issued by
the ChicagoSt. Paul, Minneapolis
and Omaha railroad will be returned
by the Nebraska railroad commission
was expressed' by Ward Evans, city
attorney of South Sioux City, who
returned 'from Lincoln yesterday.
Mr. Evans represented his city in
the fight to compel' the railroad to
reestablish train stops on Norfolk
line trains which recently were an
nulled by the road.
Written arguments will be submit
ted next Thursday and an. early de
cision is anticipated by Mr. Evans.
The attorney said railroad officials
admitted on the witness stand that
street car competition from Sioux
City to South Sioux City and Dakota
City, affecting both east and west
bound traffic, had had a largo part
in prompting the change of sched
ules. Mr. Evans said the road- offi
cials failed to show that South Sioux
City ia receiving the service to which
it is entitled by reason of its size and
Ideation. Street car competion, not
only caused a loss of revenue in
straight traffic, but helped passen
gers to evade increased rates gov
erning interstate traffic as compared
with intrastate traffic, it, was ar
gued by the road.
Sioux City Journal, 21: Mr. and
Mrs. Harry Ostmeyer and daughter
of Dakota City, Neb., are the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ostmeyer.
. . . .The annual ice harvest will be
gin in Sioux City tomorrow. At
that time the Consumers Ice compa
ny will put on a force of men on the
Big Sioux river. Monday another
force will begin operations at Crys
tal lake.... Ward Evans, city attor
ney of South Sioux City, who ha3
been at Lincoln, Neb,, representing
the city in the hearing before the
Nebraska state railroad commission
to force the Omaha railroad to stop
its trains at South Sioux City, is ex
pected to return today.... In admit
ting before the Nebraska state rail
road commission at Lincoln Tuesday
that the principal reason for omit
ting stops at South Sioux City and
other Nebraska towns on the Nor
folk division was the loss of revenue
caused by use of stroot cars from the

County Agent's Field Notes
BY A. H. DECKHOFF.
Short Course a Success.
The only bad feature to tho meet
ings which closed last Friday evening,
was that tho attendance was curtail
ed occount of the very cold weath
er, while some others wero kept
away by the proximity of tho holi
days.
In point of interest, to use one of
the speakers' own words, "Wo have
never had a better one and never
expect to have a more responsive
audience."
That the instructors gave satisfac
tion in tho presentation of their
work is attested by tho fact that
those who came the first day wero
regular in their attendance through
out tho entire course.
The domestic science work was
conducted by the Misses Itokahr and
Canflcld, while the men's branch was
under tho supervision of Professors
Wood and Warner, all of tho Exten
sion Service, University of Nebraska.
It was especially pleasing to noto
that quality and not quantity was
tho dominant factor, and that thoso
in attendance voiced their approval
by going on record unanimously as
favoring another short course next
year.
Friday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, in
the court house in Dakota City, will
bo held the annual meeting of the
Dakota County Farmers' Associa-.
tion.
All who possibly can should at
tend. The year's work will be sum
med up in a report by County Agent
BeckhofT, whoso resignation was
tendered a short time ago. ,
The speaker of tho day will be
Prof. W. W. Burr, lato of North
Platte Experiment Station, now head
of Agronomy at the Nebraska Ex
periment Station at Lincoln.
All will enjoy hearing him nnd
will profit by his address. The
weather permitting, let's see if
tho court house cannot be filled.
