Punta Gorda and Bartow had the
best asphalt paving they had seen.
The actual wrk Jiere was dona by
the Cornwall Construction Com

Jaudon Engineering . Company,
which also supervised the con
struction of the sidewalks. The
chief credit for making it possible
to carry out the asphalt paving
project is due to , Commissioner
Whitten.
As in all public works, there has
been a division of opinion as to
the wisdom of these undertakings,

the bond trustees, the other two

had an important part in the spec

The fin..l estimate for the

missioners and settlement made
with the Cornwall Construction
Co. for the work. Check for some-
thins over $6,000.00, the final pay

The sheet asphalt is laid two
inches thick on a special founda
tion of marl that was put down
to a good depth and packed with
heavy rollers; and by many who
have made a thorough inspection
of it, it has been pronounced one
of the best pieces of street paving
of this kind in the state. A com

ever having been done in any oth
er campaign for the United States
Senate. Enough said. . ' ; -
fWhcn Mr. Knott was first de
clared nominated, he.- requested
that all of his net gain votes m
the recount of Madison county,
173, be thrown out. There was
much talk of fraud in the Green
ville precinct, where the net gain
was 58 ' votes. L have always
thought , and still think, that
reward of fully $1,000.00 should
have been offered for the convic
tion of those who perpetrated the
fraud in the Greenville precinct
Mr. Catts intimated in his speech
es that he had secured some infor
roation relative to this fraud,
through a dective. He has never
divulged the same. Whoever
tampered with these ballot boxes
should be punished, as it was a di
rect crime against every one in
Blorida. I trust the Incoming
governor will offer a suitable re
ward.
Exclusive of the Greenville pre
cmct, Mr. Knott's net gain in
Madison county was 115. Throw
ing these out, left Mr. Knott's net
gain throughout the state about
21 or 22 in excess of his nearest
competitor, Mi4, 'Catts.-The throw
ing out of these votes of Madison
county, gave Mr. Catts Attorney
the opportunity of demanding the
counting of C9. votes, which Mr
Catts received in the Alachua pre
cinct of Alachua county. These
votes had not been counted, be
cause the inspectors of the elec
tion failed to sign and swear to
the returns. Upon these being
properly certified, Mr. Catts was
undoubtedly entitled to them.
Twice before this, Air. Calls
local attorneys had ? instituted
mandamus proceedings vto h a ve
them counted. On both occasions,
his chief attorney, Mr. Flournoy,
had the proceed bigs st opped. ; Af
ter Mr. Knott had had the Green
ville precinct and the other 115
stances, it becomes a real nuisi e
to the subscriber. In sections
where but few 'phones are instal
led, these are regarded as public
conveniences. While the average
person is really pleased to favor
a friend or a nearby neighbor,
even at the cost of a little incon- j
venience and trouble, he does not
like to be errand boy for the entire
neighborhood.
"Some people have the nerve to
call at any time of the day or
night and request that you go a
block or two and bring some per
son that they desire to speak to
to your 'phone. Both parties may
be utter strangers to the one hav
ing the 'phone. Where something
af vital importance is at stake,
there is excuse for the imposition,
but in most cases where the matter
is of trivial character, it justifies
a flat refusal. The best way to
break up this practice is to polite
ly to refuse to be made the goat."

Mr. Catta'-.juanagers shelled the
woods with tfhe statement, that the
69 votes of ''Alachua precinct had
never been ounted, the natural
inference being that if they had
been, Mr. Catts would have been
the nominee of the Democratic
party. The majority of the Dem
ocrats evidently thought that Mr.
Catts had been swindled out of the
nomination.
The election is all over with.
The truth might as well be re
cognized. Mr. Catts' pre-pri-mary
speeches were all directed a

ident ' Wilson 'a , Secreta :y . ' No

It was the duty oi Mr. Knott to
contest the election. He would
have been unworthy of thesupport
of those who voted for him, if he
had not done so. Five candidates
for governor, about 85,000 polled.
Mr. Catts led Mr. Knott by 2i)t
votes, including first and second
choice votes, in certain precinct
were ignorantly credited to Mr.
Catts. The inspectors afterwards
stating that in as much as the tal
ly Bheets called for all the first
choico votes to be placed in the
first column, to the left of the
names of the candiates, that all of
the second choice votes should be
placed in the first column to the
right of the candidates. M". ;atts'
name , coming alphabetically first,
be received the benefit of all such
errors. In many precincts, ' the
inspectors placed all of the sec
ond choico votes in tho . erossed
out column, where they could not
be counted at all. Thore isn't
any man living who doesn't say
that , the votes should have been
credited a they were cast.
These errors show on the face
of the returns at many of the
county seats. Mr. Knott would
have been a great coward if he
had not insisted on the correction
of such errors. . ? ; ,4
It should be shown who stolo
the ballot box in the Watertown
precinct; who stole the ballots out
of the boxes in certain precincts
in Baker coun ty.Such thefts pre
vented a re-count of those ballots.
The ballots had to stand as orig
inally counted: Who received the
benefit of such! It should be
shown who tampered with the
Greenville Dreeinct ballot box.
A reward should be offered.
Mr. Knott's great error consist
ed in having thrown out the 115 j
votes of Madison . county.: Tiffs
was exclusive of the 58 votes of
tje Greenville precinct. By so do
ing, he gave the opposition the op
portunity ofi contesting the nomi
nation up the within thirty days
of the November election. The
69 votes of Alachua county were
ulwcys kept in the front. A con
tinuous campaign of "swindling"
Mr, latts out of the nomination,
was always in evidence. The peo
ple .were led to believe that Mr.
Catts, was being swindled out of
the. nomination. Thirty davs be
fore the November election, Mr.
ivnott was finally known as the
nominee -too late to chantre the
tide.
Every candidate in the Demo
cratic primary swore that ' he
would support the nominee. I
supported Mr. Knott for gover
nor. I would have supported Mr,
Catts, had he been the nominee.
he continued and continuous
claim that the 69 votes of the A-
achua precinct had never been
counted for Mr. Catts, Mr. Knott's
lead being only about 22, did
much toward the election of Mr.
Catts. Many Democrats voted
for Mr. Catts, believing that he
was the rightful nominee. Some
people say that figures won't lie.
