COMMUNITY TREE.
BRINGS JOY TO CHILDREN FROM
- EVERT NEIGHBORHOOD.
1,200 Packages Delivered And ManjSib-
slanlial Gifts To Poor. Church
es Also Celebrate.
The Community Chrii tmas tree entered
Into by practically every citizen of the
town and quite a number from the
county, brought happiness and joy to
tlio hearts and homes of over twelve
hundred children, to say nothing of the
more substantial necessities which
were distributed to the needy and poor.
Six crates of oranges, two barrels of
apples, 400 pounds of candy and 200
pounds of i.utu were distributed to the
children, giving each child an orange,
an apple, about one-half pound candy
and some nuts. The lights In the park
which so gorgeously illuminate the tree
were turned on promptly at 5:30 o, clock
and simultaneously began the carols,
sung by 100 children, led by Mrs. May
Hughes Noland, in the balcony of the
court house. The public square and
the court house was packed with men,
women and children, the latter being
lined up, two abreast and marched
through,the corridors of the building
wtiere over one thousand children un
dcr twelve years of age were handed a
sack containing the candies, nuts,
oranges and apples, during the entire
time the Danville band composed of
fourteen pieces was playing appropri
ate airs, that added very much to the
joyous occasion 'No more successful
or philanthropic enterprise was ever
undertaken before in this community
and as a result, it seems to be the
unanimous opinion of every one, that
it should be permanent and the happy
celebration be held every Christmas.
Lancaster and community fairly out
did herself this Christ.nus. Never
before has the entire city joined hands
in such a charitable undertaking. Not
only this, but the churches of the city
had their Christmas trees and some
distributed "white gifts" and every
precaution was taken by them to see
that none of the needy of the com
munity were overlooked. Songs,
carols and recitations wero held during
the celebrations at these churches and
altogether it has been a joyous Christ
mas indeed.
