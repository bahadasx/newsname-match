said by a man known to be close to Villa; ' - -
A Mexiean refugee who arrived here from Torreon-' also
affirmed that Villa was preparing to move north with a column of
approximately 5(KK) men in order to attack Chihuahua' City. He

"""WASHINGTON, Dee. 28. In spite of the wide gulf between the
insistence of the central powers for an immediate peace conference
and the forecast of an unanimous refusal by the entente allies to
enter such a conference without knowing Germany's terms in
advance, the American government believes the negotiations in
progress are resulting in good. It is said with authority that until
the door to peace actually is closed
Wilson will continue to hope that any discussion of the subject will
tend to hasten the end of the war.
Count von Hernstorff, the German ambassador, returning unex
pectedly last night from Now York, authorized the Associated
Press to make the following statement: "I regard the note of my
government as constituting an acceptance of everything suggested
by President Wilson in his note

It was made clear at the embassy that Germany stands ready
to make known her terms on the first day of any conference that
may be held, and officials expressed themselves as being greatly
surprised at the view prevailing

to make peace. The German diplomats say President Wilson had
no intention of drawing a public declaration concerning terms from
the central powers. On the contrary they think the president's
suggestion that an early occasion be found to call out from all the
nations now at war such an avowal of their respective views as to
the terms upon which the war
met by Germany in seeking an

The German policy, upon which the reply to President Wilson's
