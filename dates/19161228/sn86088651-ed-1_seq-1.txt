(Br Associated Preaa)
Iredo, Texas, Dec. 28. A project
whose magnitude suggests the build
ing of the Panama canal la being con
sidered In Mexico, according to Vera
Crux newspapers which have reached
the border recently.
This project Is the building of a
pipe Hue from the Mexican coast,
probably with one terminal at Tarn-
Pico, to the coast of England. The
object Is to pump oil from the fielda
of Mexico to the European terminal.
The cost of the oil duct, or "oleo
ducto," would approximate 10 million
pounds sterling or approximately 50
million dollars.
While the plan baa not yet been
fully developed, the projectors assert
that their proposition is feasible, that
a flexible pipe line, the principal In
gredient of which would be a species
of gum, could be built whereby crude
oil could be pumped at a cost of two
shillings (25 cents) for each 1,000
mllea.
Engineers, ao the newspapers state,
figure that a gum pipe line could be
utilized capable of sustaining aa In
ternal pressure of 2.000 pounds to the
square inch and an external pressure
of no less than 10,000 pounds.
