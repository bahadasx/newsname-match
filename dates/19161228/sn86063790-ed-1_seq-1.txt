CHANGED BRITISH FACE. |
Scientist Reports Alteration in Sliape
as Food Changes. j
??? \
The influenceTof imperfect dentition
on the individual face may be
often seen, but a change in the form i
of the British face that is general
has been traced by Prof. Keith in a
British association paper. From a
onmnnrisrm nf anoipnt and modern
skulls, it appears that the cheekbone
is becoming tilted. This is due to
gradual atrophy from disuse of the
bony processes connecting the temple
and jawbones, and is a natural
result of the substitution of cooked
food and soft cereals for the tough
means and imperfectly ground corns
used until the early years of the
Christian era. Besides the obvious
narrowing of the jaws, there has
been increase in their height, bone
being also added around the orifice
of the nostrils. No theory of mechanical
action seems to explain this
deposit of bone, and Professor Keith
thinks it may have followed some
change in bone production under the
influence of the internal secretions
of the ductless glands, also that it
may possibly be associated in some
way with the increased prevalence
of adenoids. In connection with the
changed diet, it is noted that the

Robert Gonzales Dead.
Columbia, Dec. 20.?Sergeant
Robert Elliott Gonzales, of the machine
gun .company in the Second
South Carolina infantry, died of
pneumonia late last night in the base
hospital at El Paso, Tex. He was in
private life the paragrapher of the
State, the morning newspaper of Columbia.
He was 28 years of age.
The funeral will be held in Columbia,
on a day not as yet designated.
Sergeant Gonzales had been ill only
three or four days. His is the eighth
death from pneumonia among the troops
at El PasQ' within a week.
Mr. Gonzales was the only spn of
William E. Gonzales, American minister
to Cuba. He had been granted
a furlough and was to have passed
through Columbia this week on his
way to New York, where the family
intended assembling for the holidays.
His father had been informed of his
illness and was en route from Havana
to El Paso. A telegram informing
him of Sergeant Gonzales's death
intercepted him in Florida and he
changed his course to Columbia.
Sergeant Gonzales' uncle, Ambrose
E. Gonzales, with his mother and his
little sister, Alida, reached Columbia
this afternoon, learning of their
bereavement only on their arrival.
Col. Holmes B. Springs, commanding
the Second, telegraphed to the
State: "Bob died at 11 o'clock tonight.
The regiment mourns the loss
of a good and true soldier and South
Carolina loses a valuable and distinguished
citizen. He died with
honor to the State arid its pfeople.
Our sympathy to you all in your'
sad bereavement."
/ Robert Gonzales was born in Columbia
28 years ago and was educated
at the Citadel and at the University
of South Carolina. He joined
the editorial staff of The State not
long after he left the university, h:s
father being then editor of the paper,
which was founded by his uncles,
Ambrose E. Gonzales and the
late N. G. Gonzales. He had been continuously
on the staff until on the
calling out of the troops in June he
enlisted as a private. He was made
a sergeant before the regiment left
Camp Moore last August. He was
an ardent young soldier, having gotten
a taste of military life during the
Spanish-American war, when he
lived for some months in the tent
of his father, a captain in, the Second
South Carolina Volunteers, at
Marianao, just outside Havana.
His paragraphs were. liberally
quoted in the Literary Digest and
other publications and he was generally
regarded as one of the most
brilliant paragraphers in the country.
Former Governor Blease this afternoon
paid a fine tribute to the
memory of Mr. Gonzales. "While I
did not know him personally," he
said, "and while The Columbia State
has always fought me, I admired his
brilliancy, and the newspaper world
has suffered a loss in his death."
Plenty of Practice.

SCHEME TO CHECK WEEVIL.
\
1
Propose System of Quarantine Zones
to Stamp Out Cotton Pest.
1
Creation of a series of zones in i
the South in which no cotton could 1
be grown for a period of one year as 1
a means of checking and exterminating
the boll weev;l m this country 1
will be proposed in a bill which Sen- i
ator Smith of South Carolina an- 1
nounced Wednesday night he soon ]
would offer and urge for passage.
The senator proposes that the nongrowing
area shall be started in the
extreme northeastern limit * of the
cotton section and gradually work
southward and westward in a series
of zones 100 miles in width each
year until th# entire cotton growing
section shall have been covered.
The federal government,. Senator
Smith eaid would be sriven the dow
er to police the zone to see that the 1
law was observed and growers and 1
ginners affected would be compen- {
sated by the government. Experts 1
estimated that it would cost twenty- 4
five million dollars to maintain the 4
boll weevil zone in Alabama which (
Senator Smith proposed a year ago. T
The first year the cotton prohibir 1
tive zone woud include the extreme 4
eastern portions of North Carolina 1
and South Carolina. The next year 5
this zone would be released and the c
non-productive area extended one
hundred miles and this rotation (
would be kept up until the entire 1
territory had been covered.
"Highest entomological authori- *
ties have approved the zone system {
as the only practical means of ex- 1
terminating the devastating boll *
weevil in this country," said Senator 4
Smith. "The annual cost would be 5
11111111 lesiiilili as wui^aicu iu 1.11c ucuefit
that would be derived. Six hundred
million dollars has been expend- [
ed to eradicate the boll weevil in
this country, but he still thrives and J
is moving rapidly toward the fields ^
of North and South Carolina.
"The zone system not only would 1
prove the practicability of this meth- 1
od of exterminating the boll weevil, 1
but by giving farmers opportunity to 1
grow cover crops, would demonstrate '
whether the South can successfully ;
grow other food products."

IMPROVING THE MODEL. j
laint-Gaudens's Task of Making Distinguished
Sitter Intellectual.
In his younger days Saint-Gaulens
was shy and avoided somewhat
he company of the great, and he deicribed
to me as one of his early
rials his modelling of a bust of a
iistinguished diplomat. This gentlenan's
doctor had ordered him to
>oak his feet, so when he posed for
ny friend he sat wrapped up in a
ilanket on a high chair, his feet
>tuck in a tub of water which it was
)art of Saint-Gaudens's duty to keep
lot. When the bust was well under
vay Saint-Gaudens noticed that the
Iistinguished diplomat kept bringing
:he conversation around to Socrates
md Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and
Plato. The reason for this was not
long obscure. "I find," said the D.
D., "after a careful examination,
:hat all these great and distinguished
nen had very broad foreheads. Just
broaden mine a bit." So SaintGraudens,
afraid to object, meekly
jomplied. Repeated urgings and the
resultant broadenings brought the
forehead finally to the point where
it seemed to be affected with some
dreadful swelling disease. But this
did. not bring complete satisfaction
to the heart of the sitter. He suggested
that these same great forerunners
of his were also notable for
having had very deep-set eyes. So
poor Saint-Gaudens was forced to
bore and bore, deeper and deeper,
until he almost pierced through the
back. He told me this story with
?reat excitement, interspersing in
the narrative many uncomplimentary
remarks on celebrities in general,
md illustrating it all by puffing out
bis cheeks and making violet boring
gestures with his forefinger. He said
be'd give anything to get hold of
that bust and smash it to atoms.?

Negroes Lured North in a Plight.
Savannah, Dec. 16.?The plight of
the negroes who went North last
summer from Georgia seeking work
is deplorable, according to a letter
received today by Miss Helen Cinnamond,
secretary of the Associated
Charities, from the Bureau of Associated
Charities of Newark, N. J.
The letter states that "during the
last month Newark has been overrun
with colored families from Georgia
and Alabama. They told us that
two months ago a white man came
to that section of the country and
told them common laborers would
be paid $3 a day in Newark.
"The families which arrived here
found this to be untrue. Most of
them have returned and some were
taken ill with pneumonia and removed
to the hospital."
The Evolution of Rdosevelt.
Mr. Roosevelt's disappointment
with the outcome of the elctioii is
keen but not overwhelming. And
the more he thinks over the matter,
in the course of his brief resume the
more cheerful he gets to be. In
the beginning he is inclined to think
Lhat the trouble is with the nation's
moral fibre. Later it occurs to him
:hat we are not really wicked, but
Dnly asleep. Towards the end it
turns out that we are not asleep at
ill, but, on the contrary, very wide
iwake. So awake were we that the
ordinary pre-election gold brick of
the professional politician utterly
tailed to deceive. In developing this
irgument Mr. Roosevelt makes confession
of his own errors, in very
subtle form, to be sure, but still a
confession:
When public men are readily parioned
for making any promise whichthey
think will secure public favor
3efore. election, and for repudiating
my promise which they think it inconvenient
to keep after election, it
is impossible to expect that the vot3rs
will not finally grow skeptical
ibout all promises, prophecies, and

Now, this at first sight would
seem to be pointing straight at Mr.
Wilson but logically it cannot be.
It would be absurd to argue that
:he people, disgusted with Mr. Wilson's
violated pledges, showed their
resentment by re-electing him. The
reference is really to Mr. Roosevelt
himself. The people, wide awake to
the emptiness of pre-election pledges
ind conversions, refused to vote for
Roosevelt, the ally of Perkins and
Penrose, and voted for the real
Roosevelt as embodied in the ideas
which Mr. Wilson stole. Thus while
the outcome of the election is to Mr.
Roosevelt a sorrow, yet it is a sweet
sorrow.?New York Evening Post.

PEACE MOVEMENT IS MADE
SENIXS NOTE TO BELLIGERENTS
TO OUTLINE VIEWS.
President Does Not Propose Peace or
Offer Mediation, But Suggests That
Warring Nations Discuss Terms.
Washington, Dec. 20.?President
Wilson has appealed to all the belligerents
to discuss terms of peace.
Without actually proposing peace
or offering mediation, the president
* _ _ X ? 1 A 4. ~ iUA
nas sent iorniai uutes lu me suvcmments
of all the warring nations suggesting
that "an early occasion be
sought to call out from the nations
now at war such an avowal of their
respective views as to the terms upon
which the war mght be concluded
and the arrangements which would
be deemed satisfactory as a guaranty
against its renewal or the kindling
of any similar conflict in the future,
as would make it possible frankly to
compare them."
Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration
officials have described as his course,
the president last night despatched
notes to all the belligerents, and to
all the neutrals for their information.
Summarized in the president's
own words as contained in the notes
his attitude is as follows:
^ot Proposing Peaee.
"The president is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering mediation.
He is merely proposing that
soundings be taken in order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with
the belligerent, how near the haven
of peace may be for which all mankind
longs with an intense and increasing
longing. He believes tha^t
the spirit in which he speaks.and the
objects which he seeks will be understood
by all concerned, and he
confdently hopes for a response
which will bring a new light into the
affairs of thtf world."
The notes to the belligerents are
prefaced with the instruction by Secretary
Lansing to the American ambassadors
presenting them:
"The president directs to send
you the following communication tc
be presented immediately to the minister
of foreign affairs of the government
to which you are accredited."
The text of the notes themselves
then begin identically as follows:
"The president of the United
States has instructed me to suggest
to the (here is inserted a designator
of the government addressed) a
course of action with regard to the
nresent war which he hoDes that the
government will take under consideration
as suggested in the most
friendly spirit as coming not only
from a friend, but also as coming
from the representative of a neutral
nation whose interests have beer
most seriously affected by the wai
and whose concern for its early conclusion
arises out of a manifest necessity
to determine how beat tc
safeguard those interests if the wai
is to continue."
At this point the texts vary.
In the notes to the central powers
this paragraph follows next:
To the Central Powers.
"The suggestion which I am instructed
to make the president has
long had it in mind to offer. He is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
a desire to play a part in connection
with the recent overtures of the central
powers. It has in fact been in
no way suggested by them in its
origin and the president would have
delayed offering it until those overtures
had been independently answered,
but for the fact that it also
concerns tne question 01 peace ana
may best be considered in connection
with other proposals which would
have the same end in view. The
president can only beg that his suggestion
be considered entirely on its
own merits and as if it had been
made in other circumstances."
To the Allies.
In the note to the entente allies
the fololwing paragraph takes the
place of the one just quoted:
"The suggestion which I am instructed
to make the president has
long had it in mind to offer. He is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
the recent overtures of the central
powers. It is in fact in no way associated
with them in its origin and
the nresident would have delayed of
fering it until those overtures had
been answered but for the fact that
it also concerns the question of peace
and may best be considered in connection
with other proposals which
have the same end in view. The
\
> i
._ / _ * .
president can only beg that his suggestion
be considered entirely on its
own merits and as if it had been
made in other circumstances."
Identical Wording.
Then, all the notes proceed identically
as follows: v
"The president suggests that an
early occasion be sought to call out
from all the nations now at war such
an avowal of their respective views
as to the terms upon which the war
might be concluded and the arrangements
which would be deemed satisfactory
as a guaranty against its renewal
of the kindling of any similar
conflict in the future as would make ~ ^
it possible frankly to compare them.
He is indifferent as to the means tak->
en to accomplish this. He would be
happy himself to serve, or even to
take the initiative in this accomplishment,
in any way that might
prove acceptable, but he has no desire
to determine the method or the
, instrumentality. One way will be as
acceptable to him as another if only
the great object he has in mind he
attained.
Aims of Both Sides.
"He takes the liberty of calling attention
to the fact that the objects
which the statesmen of the belligerents
on both sides have in mind in
this war are virtually the same, as
( stated in general terms to their own
people and to the world. Each side
desires to make the rights and priv- , JS
ileges of weak peoples and small
States as secure against aggression
' or denial in the future as the rights
and privileges of the great and pow-? ^
; erful States now at war. Each ? < %
> wishes itself to be made secure in the
1 iuture, aiong wun an oiuer uauuiut
L and peoples, against the recurrence ./
of wars like this, and against ag
-gression or selfish interference of any > ^
< kind. Each would be jealous of the
f formation of any more rival leagues
to preserve an uncertain balance of
! power amidst multiplying suspicions;
' but each is ready to consider- the
1 formation of a league of nations to t
insure peace and justice throughout
' the world. Before that final step
can be taken, however, each deems it
necessary first to settle the issues ot
the present war upon terms whiclr" .
I will certainly safeguard 'the inde>
pendence, the territorial -integrity^ ,
and the political and commercial ;
freedom of the nations involved.
America's Interest
1 "In ,the measures to be taken to - -viJ
! secure the future peace of the world,
; the people and government of the
United States are as vitally and a* , |
directly interested as the .govern- v;<~?!
| ments now at war. Their interest,
[ moreover, in the means to be adopted
to relieve the smaller and weaker
DeoDle of the world of the peril of'
, \. \-J r
wrong and violence is as quick and ,
, ardent as that of any other people
| or government. They stand ready, - .
t and even eager, to cooperate in the
, accomplishment of these ends, when
the war is over, wilh every indues-ft s /
and resource at their command. Tlie
( terms upon which it is to be conclu i.
ed they are not at liberty to suggest;
.but the president does feel that it
is his rights and his duty to point - /
, out their intimate interest in?its conclusion,
lest it should presently be
too late to accomplish the greater
things which lie beyond its conclu-'
, sion, lest the situation of neutral nations,
now exceedingly hard to endure,
be rendered altogether intoler'
able, and lest, more than all, an injury
be done civilization itself which
can never be atoned for or repaired.
\ Comparison of Views.
"The president, therefore, feels altogether
justified in suggesting an
| immediate opportunity for a comparison
of views as to the terms .

arrangements for the peace of the
world, which all desire and in which
the neutral nations as well as those
at war are ready to play their full
responsible part. If the contest must t /
continue to proceed towards undefined
ends by slow attrition until the
one group of belligerents or the
other is exhausted, if million after
million of human lives must continue
to be offered up until on the
' one side or the other there are no
more to offer, if resentments must
be kindled that can never cool and
, despairs engendered from which
there can be no recovery, hopes of
peace and of the willing concert of
| free peoples will be rendered vain
and idle.
"The life of the entire world has
been profoundly affected. Every
part of the- great family of mankind
