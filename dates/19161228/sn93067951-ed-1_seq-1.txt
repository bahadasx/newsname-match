Washington, I). C. ?Approval bj
Denmarks' parliament of the treat}
by which the United States will ac
quire the Danish West Indies opens
the way for a prompt exchange ol
' ratifications between the two irovprn.
ments and consummation of negotiations
that have been in progress intermittently
since the war between
the States. The United States senate
already has given its approval and
as soon as the formal exchanges have
taken place the administration will
press measure in congress appropriating
the purchase price of $25,000000,
and providing for the institution
of an American territorial government
on the islands.
The three islands of the Danish
West Indies?St. Croix, St. Thomas
and St. John?lie cast of Porto Rico,
and their value to the United States
is strategic from a military point of
view. The harbors ofSt. Thomas and
St. Croix are of first importance to
the American navy, and St. Thomas
itself lies in the lane of shipping
from Europe to the Panama canal.
3 Important German, French and English
mail companies have coaling stations
there.
The acquisition of the islands by
the United States has been the subject
of unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations
since Secretary Seward began
negotiations for their acquisition
in 18G5, because the naval operations
of the war had shown the necessity
of a base in the West Indies.
A treaty was made and ratified by
Denmark, but the United States Senate
failed to set on it in proper time,
and it lapsed.

DEATI1 OF JOHN DAVID ADAMS
Little John David Adams, the HI- year
old son of Mr. and Mrs. I\ W.
Adams became intangled in a rapidly
revolving shafting at a gin in
his neighborhood on December 14;h
and was so badly crushed and bruised
that he died the next day while at the
Wadesboro hospital.
News of this terrible tragedy did
not reach this olfice until yesterday,
and details then were meagre. Just
how the little fellow was caught was
not learned, but he was hurled with
such force as to break both legs and
crush his bodly severely.
The funeral was held Saturday, the
KSth, when the Itev. J. D. Purvis ofR- I
ciated. The entire Vaughn School
settlement is in mourning on account
of the death of this bright boy.

Mr. anil Mrs. I'. W. ('. Adams.
In Memory of Little David Adams
(iod moves in a mysterious way
His Wonders to perform;
He plants his foot upon the sea
And rides upon the storm.
How true is that hit of Scripture
that says, "In the qiidstof life we are
in death."
In the early afternoon of Wednesday,
December lkth, (iod, in Ilis mysterious
way, called the soul of little
David Adams hack to his own.
Was it a kind, loving Father who
did it? We know it was, yet in a
distant city a broken hearted little
friend goes out in to the silent night
and looking up at the twinkling stars
wonders why he should be stricken
down in the very prime of his young
life.
Was it for the sake of some care- '
loss, thoughtless one? Was it to
make some one pause in life and
think how uncertain is life?
Then in the silence of the night i
comes back the answer in God's great
eternity beyond, "Doesn't He need
clean, pure souls to carry on His
work?"
So let us realize that He is not an
angry God, dealing with our precious
little friend, but a tender, loving
Father, beckoning through the little
ones to a life beyond the grave, where
there is no more death, no more sorrow
and no more parting. ?
