Dear Editor I read nn editorial in
Inst weeks News about the work of the
Commercial Club and 1 thought your
readers would like to hear from some
I one outside of Jasper We think the
club has accomplished a great deal for
Jasper nnd vicinity and should have
credit for It The majority of its mem
berspan be depended upon to do what
lry think is nest and tho majority
viould rule and we need not be sur
prised if some of the money is spent on
the park and streets of Jasper as most
of the money is paid by the citizens of
Jasper and the people in the country
can have the use of the park and streets
as well as the people in Jasper
Yours truly

which were well attended and a great

days wherein all work was donated
and the result of these good roads days
were that 910 loads of rock and gravel
were placed on the rotd free of charge

BANK ROBBERS IN JASPER
Yeggs Get a Small Haul from
First National Christmas
Morning
A muilled explosion was heard by a
number of Jasper residents Christmas
morning between 015 and 510 and a
few minutes later the hurried departure
of an automobile going north No at
tention was paid to either and not un
til about 8 oclock was it discovered
that cracksmen had attempted a little
job at the First National Bank The
discovery was made by Assistant
Cashier E L Crawford who went to
the bank to get his gun to go hunting
The robbers forced the backdoors to the
bank to make their entrance and drilled
a hole into the vault door lock and put
in a shot of nltro This part of the
job was very nicely done for it shat
tered the lock without doing any other
damage and without attracting atten
tion from the outside
After gaining an entrance to the
vault the men rilled the safe deposit
boxes and other private boxes in the
vault but found no money except a
sum less than 200 which had been re
ceived by the bank after the safe had
been locked Saturday evening This
money had been placed in a pigeon
hole in the vault
The safe is a screw door time lock
allair and sets in the back end of tne
vault The robbers tried to force the
safe door with heavy hammers of some
kind but failed and gave up the job
about 5o going north in some kind of
a car according to Hie belief of people
residing in the block north of the bank
The owners of private papers in the
boxes in the vault have btfen going ov
er their papers but nothing is reported
missing except the small amount of
money above stated
As far as we know there is no clew
to the robbers although several strang
ers were noticed about town the night
before It is believed the men with
the automobile did not ariive inJasper
until very late for some reason which
accounts for the explosion so late in the
morning
Depositors in Jasper banks however
need have no fear of such visitors as
both banks are fully insured in every
respect
