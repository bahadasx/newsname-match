K. Irwin Describes Visit To Great
Willys-Overland Conven
tion at Toledo.
W. It. Irwin, Willys-Overland deal
er in this city, who was one of the
6,000 dealers visiting the great To
ledo plant iu connection with the im
mense convention which was held
there, recounts his experiences in this
entertaiuing letter to the editor:
Some action!
Nothing was ever so impressive as
our tour of the great plant thai
turns out Willys-Overland cars.
Our pullnians all parked in the
company's yards. There was room
enough, for there are seven and three
quarters miles of track within the
plant.
Each man got a card containing
a picture of Mr. Willys and an auto
graphed message of welcome from
him. Next thing I knew we vere up
on the steps of the stunning new ad
ministration building getting photo
graphed. Slovators shot up to the company's
own restaurant on the sixth floor.
There we had a corking breakfast.
At each plate was a copy of the live
Willys-Overland house organ "The
Starter." It mapped our day's pro
gram. Then started our tour of the plant.
Our guides were carefully picked
men. They knew the plant from end
to end, and the parties were small
so that each member of the party
could have his questions answered.
Nobody ought to try to .(ell Willys
Overland' without knowing this plant.
You can't grip the immensity of the
proposition till you do.
It Is no piker business.
$25,000,000 are tied up in land,
buildings and machinery, not to say
a word about the stock of parts and
raw material. -
From the roof of the wonderful ad
ministration building, which stands
out like a state capita!, you get a
panorama of the plant. You can
then readily believe that it occupies
103 acres, with 4,486,680 square
feet of floor space In daily use and a
production capacity of 1000 cars per
day.
You can appreciate t(je growth
from 250 employes in 1908 to 17,
300 in 1916.
1,000 persons, more than the en
tire manufacturing force of many a
company, work in the administration
building alone. This structure, 375
feet long, has every facility for rapid
work, including dictaphones, its own
telegraph and telephone system and
a mall handling department that does
about everything but write the let
ters.
388 persons can be fed In the res
taurant at one time.
But this is nothing to what one
hits when you cross Into the shops.
It is a whirl of action, yet all is sys
tem.
Parts by the untold thousands are
here, with a value into the millions of
dollars. There are lines of motors II
never saw so many crank shafs to
gether. Our guide said 6,000 I'd
have believed 60,000
There is stock in bins, stock in
yards, stock along the walls, con
nectlng rods, frames, fenders, mud
guards, hoods, rims springs, axles,
torsin tubes, transmission gear,
shnfs, brake parts, steering rods, pe
dais it is an unending procession.
Every thirty days sees ar. average
of 1000 tons of steel come in. It is
handled by a magnetic crane that
enables two men to do a work that
formerly required thirty.
There are amazing machines.
The toggle press, for example, held
us all. This monster with its pres
sure of 1000 tons, shapes cold steel
like cardboard. A piece of metal
fed to it comes out as a side frame.
It can make 2000 of these In an eight
hour day.
Other machines stamp out radiator
shells, fenders, cowl dashes and
doors.
You take off your hat to the drop
forging machines. Down comes the
hammer, and the fiery piece of iron
Is beaten Into shape. The complete
drop forging ofthe front can be ac
complished with one heat.
Every kind of part requiring
strength was dropforged while we
looked on, axles, crank shafts, brake
assembly rods, brake and coptrol
rods, spring shackles, gear blanks and
brake rod sectors.
We saw the company's accurate
jystem of die making. It calls for a
special workman on each detail.
One works on the shaper, another on
the plane and a third on die sinking.
The multiple spindle drill in one

HEPPNER HIGH DEFEATS
LEXINGTON HIGH 26-11
10 to 4 and 26 to 11 were the scor
es marked on the score card last Fri
day evening when the Lexington high
school girls' and boys' basket ball
teams played Heppner high aggrega
tions. The first score was the re
sult of the girls' game and Lexington
claimed the long end. The visitors
outplayed the local girls in nearly
every department and their team
work and accuracy in shooting bas
kets were responsible for their vic
tory.
Heppner carried away the big end
of the score in the boys' game and
showed much Improvement since the
game with Ione'two weeks ago. Bar-
ratt took the center position, Hughes,
the first string man, being on the sick
list. Nlckolson and Crawford, at
forward showed up to good advantage
and Peterson and Brown, at guard,
held the Lexington forwards down to
only a few baskets.
For Lexngton, Johnson, at forward
played the stellar role and to him can
be credited the lion's share of the
visitor's points.
Karl Beach of Lexington refereed
and Wm. O'Rourke of Heppner um
pired the boys game. David Wilson
acted as umpire for the girls and Mr.
Beach refereed.
After the games the visitors were
guests of the local high school at an
Informal reception at the high school
building.

Average Annual Kate of Increase Has
Been 10 Per Cent For The
Last 12 Years.
University of Oregon, Eugene, Dec.
25. If the University of Oregon
grows for the next ten years at the
average rate of the last twelve years
its enrollment for the college year'of
1926-27 will be 4,500.
The average rate of annual In
crease in the residence registration
at Eugene for the last twelve years
has been 16 per cent.
This average increase has been ex
perienced in spite of the loss of the
engineering schools, which however,
only temporarily retarded the rale of
growth.
The Increase this year over the cor
responding date last year is 18 per
cent. The percentage of increase has
been larger during the later portion
than during ti.e earlier portion of the
twelve year period. No reason is
seen at the 'Jnwj.'siw why the per
centage ahral'i get any smaller for
the next ten y:jars.
An attendance of 4500 would give
the University of Oregon an enroll
ment equivalent to the present en
rollments of such well-known Amer
ican institutions as Ohio State Uni
versity, University of Missouri, Uni
versity of Nebraska, Syracuse Uni
versity and Northwestern University
of Evanston. Only a few American
universities have now a larger enroll
ment. Non-residence enrollments have
been growing much more rapidly
than merely 16 per cent per annum:
The correspondence-study enroll
ment is now 675, an increase of 150
per cent In two years. The extension
class enrollment is now 1694, an in
crease of about 333 per cent In two
years. The estimated attendance at
extension lectures for tills college
year Is 74,000, an Increase of about
20 per cent.
Increase In the class room facilities
of Deady halt, the orginal building
on the campus; construction of John
son hall, the new administration and
classromm building; of the architec
ture building; and of the new educat
ion building, have made it possible
to provide room for the added stu
dents. To meet the continued in
crease, however, a continued building
program will be necessary.

that Ed Wright county clerk of Union
county, probably will become secre
tary of the Public Service Commission
after the first of the year. The posi

er. Mr. Ostrander will remain on

position held before H. H. Corey,
then secretary, became a member of
the Commission.

Corey was defeated, he would use his
influence to retain Mr. Corey as sec
retary. The selection of Mr. Wright has
