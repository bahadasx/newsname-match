WHO KILLED
CHAS. 0. CURTISS?
Nobody Charged With Killing
Deputy on City Dock
November 5
The battle betweent the I, W. W.s
and deputies on tho city dock Novem
ber 5 has developed a mystery. Last
week 74 men v. •>. < placed on trial in
this city charged with the killing of
Jefferson Beard, but two men, who
were playing tho part of deputies on
that day were killed, yet we find that
nobody has been charged with the
killing of the other man Charles O.
Curtiss. Elsewhere in this pa] or will
be found the form of information filed
by attorney Webb against the 74 men
now in jail.
It will be noted that the ir,formation :
was changed at the last minute. The I
first information charged the men!
with killing both Curtiss and Beard
but the Curtiss charge has been drop
ped.
This lends one to suspect that the
authorities hnve other information re
garding the killing of Curtis*, which
they refuse to crive out. If the author*
ities kjtow that in I. V. W.s did not
kill parties then Lh n-j ■ have other
information u> ;! .■ sff . that some
body alse killed him. Why don't they
let us know instead of holding us in
susper.ee V.o o o as anxious
to have the person or persons who
killed Curtiss brought to trial as we
are those who killed Beard. The
authorities MUST La.o the Informs.
tion or they would i.et have changed
the charges.. We would not like to
believe that some frii n 1 of the Ever
ett Commercial club did the deed and
that the Club is holding it secret. Hut
all kinds of rumors are likely to Ret
afloat unless the puilty one, o:- the
suspect is named. In the name of
"Justice" come across. Get the blood
hounds on the trail, "Murder will
out."

The well known nheriff of Snoho

of the "rats" from hia drinking. He
does not "see snakes" any more. All
he sees is I. W. W.'fc All the men

The United States is the richest na
tion on earth.
When the war broke out the wealth
of tho British Isles, Germany and
' Prance combined was n little greatW
i than the total wealth of the United
State-. After two years and n half
•of conflict, the wealth <>f tho Euro
pean nations has decreased rathe*
than increased, while the wealth of the
i Unit#d States has mounted to as
toundiag proportions. Today the
wealth of the United States is prob<
ably equal to the total wealth of Great
i Britain, France. German; and Russia
combined.
Sum Is Staggering
Tho department of commerce esti- j
'mated the total wealth of the United
States, during the sumr er of 1916 at

We are wholly vi tccustomed to
■■.■os. The ordinary man deals
in hundreds; the well-to-do in thou

I • deal in hundred of l>'llions.

There are nbout 20,000,000 families
in the United States. If each family
had an equal share, it would own
$11,400 worth of wealth.
Most People Are Poor
Needless to remark, each family
does not have a share. We are bil
lionaires—some of us, but the rest are
on a lower rung of the financial lad
j der. A few hundred American fami
lies enjoy incomes of $1,000,000 or
over each year. At the same time
6,000,000 families are living in pov
erty.
\ Send to the United States public
| health service in Washing-ton and ask
! for Bulletin No. 7ft. Read carefully
i over the figures cited there, and you
will be forced to the conclusion that
in so far as figures mean anything
those in that bulletin show that about
30,000,000 persons in Iho United
States are living in poverty.
Million:: in Poverty
Perhaps we should hesitate to say
it, aloud, but if there was a family in
which the fati:jr had .-. ctrong-box
full of gold, an;', in which so:r.e of the
children were milk-fi ! and fur-clad,
while others we c nt kc i an i starving,
we would consider the man a fit sub
ject for the jail or the madhouse.
How then sha.ll we think of a nation
which rates its ..•..-'■!; in 12 figures
and permits million pf its citizens to
; live in poverty?
The situation is bo grotesque that
one might lau^h were it not for Jie
fact that its big aspects are so sinis
ter as to make one draw hack in ter
ror from the abyss thai, jawna ahead.

The 74 men confined in Ihe'ootlnty

Attorney 0. T. Webb on new i''fo;mn

asked that his cliont3 bi given until
January 15 to declare their guilt or
I innocence, but Prosecuting Attorney
Webb objected to any extension of
time, and the court held that BO long
an extension was unreasonable.
The prisoners were brought from
the jail to the court hoin'c'iiti! three
divisions, 10 in the first lot, "1 in the
second and 82 in the thli'd. A heavily
tinned guard of deputy sheriff 8 ac

to Rent Decent Home
PROVIDENCE, R. I.— How is the
underpaid American wage ecu-net 1 gro
ing to be able to afford a decent
home ?
This question was put by John No
len, noted city planner of Ca;nb->ldg9,
Mass., at the recent national confoi'
ance on housing hold hero.'
"The minimum desirable li<v,i«a of
four or five roor.'.is can not be provid.
Ed in the United State-3 for lew than
about $1,800 or $2,000," he said, "that
is, for house and lot, with street im
provements, essential public utilities
and neighborhood recreation.
$15 Per- Month Is Lowest .
"A house costing that sum enn not
he offered on the basis of an economic
rent of, gay, "> per cent or 0 per sent,
for tall til ■:. ;" .1,.", -:::■ month. .■ ', > ,
"Unless' r •.»«:•! <-a 'nar with a nor«
mal family of '~':.t'o and three depend
ent child; on. ha.i an income of $15 a
week, op 1800 a yesv, ho c?.n not afford

"Thus wo gee thjU no solution ef

I form, affaeting matt than 50 ptsi1 cent

a better adjustment can. bo iiinde it)
the relation of these t'oi;!; point*. ' i
"Hers is our choice, Either the eo'st
of the hou«e and lot Baatt bo wihstun
tidily reduced, ot 1 the Btandard -,©f.
healthful living must be lowered, or
tha w»a;eg of tha poorest paid work

; possible alternativas are to put the

i the family Income, to take in board
'«y« or lodgers, or to count upon pii
i v»t# philanthropy or the public treas
: lirj to provide not a few but great
I u:s^es of wage workers with a house
nt tee« than economic rent."
There is another choice that Mr.
Nolen overlooked. That of collective
ownership of the land and machinery
of production.. With land the collect
ive property of the whole people,". it
would bo an easy matter to "squat" on
a piece cf land and proceed to buikl
thereon. The building of the house
would only require the expenditure of
physical energy. There li a surplus
of this going to waste these days in
building battleships and munitions of
war, drilling soldiers for war and
building barracks for the same, mak
ing shoddy clothe-; an 1 tumbledown
shacks, building jails and filling them
with men taken from the "eld of pro
duction, traveling salesaien selling
something that we c.:n do 'without.
Millions of us wasting cur energy on
non-essential things, blindly grasping
at freak solutions, while the only sol
ution is at hand every day in the yea,-.
The hc-usL'is' prdblem, jus:-, a? all other
problems, will not bo colved until
competition a;:.'.! (ho private owner: hip
of the means of Life is abolished and
its place taken by a system of pro
duction based on the collective owner
- hip of the..things collectively used in
.'..3 production of wealth.
