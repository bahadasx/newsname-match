Gen. Carranza's answer to the
request that he either sign or
repudiate the pending protocol which
will be delivered late today to sec
retary Lane by Luis Cabrera, chair
man of the Mexican commissioners, is
understood to contain suggestions or
modifications which have been care
fully worded to avoid ending the nego

the comment of one Mexican official
who had read the reply. Further than
that no intimation was obtainable as
to what were Its terms.
While Carranza was informed flatly
that the United States expected a final
reply last Tuesday, it seemed possioie
that the American commissioners would
not force an end of the negotiations
if his reply, even late, was not of such
character as to preclude further con

Luis Cabrera arrived here from New
