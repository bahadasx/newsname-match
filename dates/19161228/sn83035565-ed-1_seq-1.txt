"Our schools ire vacant for a
week.
Christmas is here, and as it
comes only once a year it can af
ford, as it does, to come arrayed
in its best attire and laden with
gifts for about everybody, the
old and the young, the children
and babies. If this were not the
case, Santa would go out of busi
ness, and much of the joys of life
would be lost or at least would
take the place of a passing phan
tom. No, this cannot be. As
the day was one great gift from
God to man, so we ought to es
teem the day of gift-giving and
not fail in our benefactions, giv
ing gifts to our fellow-man and
thus cultivate the grace of giv
ing and helping our fellow-man.
Christmas is now. among the
things of the past and our next
festival is New Year, and as this
will be our last appearance in the
columns of the Journal, will take
occasion to wish its readers pros
perity .and an abundant peace
and plenty through the year we
1
are about to enter upon. We
are now in a world's war which
has run about two and one half
years and which has been san
guinary and destructive without
para and the tnought presses
hpeJpon us, will the year see
ell of it. -No happier event
ccuid happen, if ended upon a
right basis. While, peace over
tures ardpassing from one bel
ligerent to another, it is hard to
conceive that the situation ?s ripe
for peace. The conflicts will pro
ceed until exhaustion will make
it impossible to continue longer,
so that it is probable the side en
dowed with the greater store of
the sinews of war, men and mo
ney, is the side to win out ultim
ately. If the leaders of this un
holy war were put on the front
line to take part in a couple of
battles, with the improved means
of war, peace would come with
out much ceremony, is the pro
phecy of this scribe.
Dismissing the subject of the
war, let us take a retrospect on
past year and ascertain, if possi
ble, whether we haye exerted , to
our full measure our opportuni
ties for right doing and correct
living, and in case we find dere
liction in our conduct that we
make needful reparation and so
amend our conduct that the mis
takes of the past will find no
place in our lives during coming
time. This is eminently the time
to make resolutions for a better
life, though many persons doubt
the propriety of doing so for the
reason that resolutions may fail
Failure or no failure, it is well to
i . -
resolve and resolve again in favor
of right doing and righteous Jiv:
ing. - Never weary in well doing
and begin life anew 6n every
New Year Day.

part in the recitation of a couple
of readings, which was greatly
appreciated by the audience.

How to Kill Insects in
the Grain Bin.
Carbon bisulphide used at the
rate of five to eight pounds to
1000 cubic feet of apace is rec
0 ommended by the Ohio Experi
ment Station for the destruction
of all insects in stored grain
The grain bins should be air tight
and the temperature above 70 de
grees. Burlap sacks or cotton
wabte saturated with the liquid
may be thrust into the grain, or
the material may be poured into
a short section of pipe plugged at
one end and perforated along the
side. The carbon bisulphide may
also be sprayed over the grain
with a pump through a small op
ening in the side of the bin. The
formation of a gas, which ishea
vier than air and settles down
through the grain, kills all the
weevils within 36 hours.

For correcting soil acidity, 1

Successful methods for the con
trol of the foot-rot of sweet po
tatoes, a serious and destructive
disease in several states, have
been developed by the specialists

In 1334 the actual cash road

much moisture in the atmosphere
are so injurious that it is difficult
to grow the crop successfully un
der these conditions.
The pasturing of corn is espec
ially applicable to semi-arid re
gions. The dry soil is not in
jured by the animals, , and very
little corn goes to waste or spoils
by coming in contact witn tne
soil. The stalks are left in good
shape to prevent the drifting of
snow.
Good stable manure is one of
the most satisfactory top-dress-
n
ings for alfalfa. It should be
applied in the late fall or early
winter and distributed evenly.
Where manure is not available,
300 or 400 pounds per acre of
acid phosphate will nearly al
ways give good results
When alfalfa is to follow win
ter wheat or other small grain
crops in the Est, a. thorough
disking, followed by frequent
harrowings, will often be all thai
maybe required, provided the
land is worked shortly after the
grain is removed. When plow
irig in this case ia necessary, the
preparation of the' seed bed will
often be facilitated by disking a
nead of the plow and by follow-
inar the plow at once witljr a pul
yerizer and harrow.
' Rye will thrive on acid or poor
soils where wheat will not grow
well and may be planted on any
soil later than wheat. It makes
one of the earliest spring , pas
tures and is excellent as a green
manure. Tnese characteristics
make rye an important factor in
farm, economy, even iri sections
where its yield of grain is not as
profitable as that of wheat.

Washington, Dec. 18. The Congres
sional Joint Committee on Interstate
Commerce, which has been conducting
the Inquiry into government regulation
and control of transportation, last
week decided to suspend its hearings
on the subject and adjourned, subject
to the call of the chairman, because of
the pressure of other work lefore Con
gress. According to the resolution cre
ating the committee, it is required to
submit a report by January 8th next
It is understood that before that time
the committee will ask for nn exten
sion of time and that the hearings will
be resumed at a later date, when some
of those who already have appeared
before the committee will be question
ed further and a great many others
will be heard. It Is probable, howev
er, that the hearings will not be resum
ed until after adjournment of Congress
on March 4lh. In addition to regular
routine business the commerce com
mittees of the two houses are charged
with the Important duty of preparing

vions investigation. This will leave
little or no time for the consideration

Country Wants Something Done,
amharl n, rnnCTPg9 and others
who are interested in the Inquiry un
dertaken by the Newlands Committee
insist that there .f Is no intention of
It seems doubtful, indeed? if th
country would permit the matter to
be dropped if there were evidence of a
desire on the' part of Congress to do
so. The nation-wide evidences of in
terest evoked by the initiation of the
Newlands humiryV show that the peo
pie of the country shippers, consum
ers and investors, as well as railway
men themselves arc aiive to the fact
that the railway situation is highly uu
satisfactory and that steps must be
taken without unnecessary delay to
make it possible for the railroads to
meet the growing needs of the nation.
From reports received here It seems
as though almost every commercial or
ganization and business interest in the
country were engaged in studying the
railroad question. The Chamber of
Commerce of the United States has
been conducting an elaborate inquiry
into various phases of the subject for
many months past. Many local and
state commercial bodies in every part
of the country have committees en
gaged in study of the problem and
have indicated a desire to come here
and present their views. National or
ganizations of manufacturers, lumber
men, coal operators, wholesale and re
tail dealers, have expressed through
resolutions their desire for the unifica
tion of the system of railway regula
tion. The National Industrial Traffic
League, speaking from the viewpoint
of shippers using the railways, has
Indorsed exclusive federal regulation
providing It is accomplished In such a
way as to give full protection and
prompt adjustment in matters relating
to transportation within the states.
Many Interests Studying Problem.
All these organizations represent pri
marily the shippers of the country, but
they are not the only ones who are
taking a hand In the discussion. The
investors of the nation, through their
own associations and through commit
tees representing the savings banks and
other financial organizations, are pre
paring to show the necessity of Improv
ing railroad credit and protecting the
rights of those whose money is invest
ed in railway securities. Finally the
railroads themselves, being vitally con
cerned in the improvement of existing
conditions, are planning 10 suomu tneir
vlews thrwlgh their executives, oper
ating officials and traffic experts and
to assert their willingness to accept far-
reaching federal regulation along lines
that will enable them to attract capital
and to provide the facilities needed for
the prompt and .efficient handling of
the country's transportation business.
Main Troubls Is Too Many M attars.
Not all of these Interests are in ac
cord as to the remedies that should he
adopted. There seems to be a general
agreement, however, that many of the
difficulties which confront the railroads
t0 meet the requirements of the na-
tion's commerce promptly and satisfac-
. arlse from tne hapnazard Bn(j
often c"fllctlllS measures of regulation
adonted from time to
time by the federal government and the
forty-eight states and that what is
needed is a well ordered, systematic
scheme of federal regulation that shall
cover the whole country and make it
possible for the railroads to provide the
extensions and improved facilities so
badly needed, while at the same time
; protecting fully the public interests.
WENT BACK TO THE RANKS.
Sergeant Johnny Poe Asked t Be Re
duced to Private.
When Johnny Poe. ex-Princeton foot
ball star, soldier, adventurer and mem
ber of the family to which Edgar Allan
Poe. the poet, belonged, was killed In
France during the allies' offensive
while serving as a private In the Brit
ish Clack Watch regiment, officers of
the United States marine corps began
to recall incidents in Poe's career with
the American marines.
In 1003. when a wur between the
United State and Colombia over ths
Panama canal strip threatened. Poe.
by authority of the then secretary of
the navy, John D. Lous, enlisted with
the ""Hen soldiers" to Ben e during the
war. If war should not result he was
to be discharged, for. excellent soldier
though he via, he could not bear the
"rigors" of a peaceful campaign.
Captain Smedli-y D. Butler appointed
Poe a sergeant In his machine gun
company, an aptwlntment not at all to
the adventurer's liking. So he went to
Colonel Littleton W. T. Waller and
asked to be reduced to private.
"I don't think I'm capable of holding
the rank of sergeant in the United
States marine corps." he told Colonel
Waller.
This was a:i unusual case, and the
colonel wanted to know why Poe con
sidered himself not fitted to hold the
rank.
"I tmve n fair education and consid
erable military training." Poe replied,
"bi.t I haven't been in the marine
corps long enough to be a sergeant and
t do the duties as well as a marine
sergeant should do them."
Colonel Waller smiled. "Why. Poe."
he said, "a number of second lieuten
ants, only recently commissioned, have
just joined us, and no one expects
them to know everything there Is to
know."
"That's all right, colonel," Poe re
plied quickly, "No one expects a sec
ond lieutenant to know anything, but
they do expect a whole lot from a ser
geant" Poe was reduced to private and was
put in charge of the mule corral, a job
more to bis liking, since there would be
no war.
Shaving Eyebrows a Fad.
Shaving the eyebrows to look spir
itual is the latest fad among women.
which threatens to make the razor an
essential of the fashionable makeup
table. The beauty expert says that
fine, thin and -highly arched eyebrow
greatly enhance the general expression
of the face, and almost any one can
cultivate such eyebrows. The spiritual
eyebrow is made by shaving the hair
away, leaving a wide space between
the brows and slli'injr the brows down
to the finest possible line. "The more
worldly you are." says the beauty doc
tor, "the more saintiy you must look.

PRACTICAL HEALTH HINT.
Dropsy.
; Dropsy is not a disease, but a
symptom. Any disorder that
causes the blood to become im
poverished and watery and at
the same time to flow through
the veins with increased pressure
can cause dropsy. For that rea
son it is often associated with
jT serious forms of heart or kidney

Dropsy that arises from heart ,
troubles is worse at night and
after exertion. Exactly the con-
trary is true of the dropsy caus-
ed by kidney trouble, which Is
more marked in the morning.
Sometimes the patient suffers
from both heart and kidney trou
ble, In which case his condition
Is very grave, and the dropsy
may become excessive. Many
persons who suffer from general
weakness, but have no actual
disease, find that their feet and
legs swell toward night, but that
symptom disappears as the de
bility passes away. Such cases
should be treated with tonics
and rest and plenty of fresh air.
