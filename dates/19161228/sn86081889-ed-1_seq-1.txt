of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel F. Peck,
of Caldwell, Kansas, died at the
home of her parents at 4 o'clock,
Tuesday afternoon, December 19,
1911 Funeral servicerwere held
from the Presbyterian church in
that city last Sunday afternoon.
Miss Gertie was born in Sum
ner county, Kansas, February 28,
1893, and hence was aged 23
years, 9 months and 21 days.
About four years ago, she
graduated in a four-year's course
from the Caldwell High School,
with first honors. Although at
that time her parents lived on
their farm four miles from the
City, she drove from home to the
school every school day never
missing a day, and never once
tardy. Since her graduation she
has taught in the public schools
with more than ordinary success.
The cause of her death was ty
phoid fever, and three of her
brothers have it all at home.
The Pennsylvania relatives and
friends extend sincere sympathy
to Mr. and Mrs. Peck in this
hour of sore affliction.

The McConnellsburg Institute.
The following details of the
work of the Farmers Institute
held in McConnellsburg last week
has been handed us for publica
tion by the secretary, Mr. W. C.
Patterson.
The Farmers' Institute was
opened at 2 P. M. The session
was inaugurated by divine ser
vices conducted by Rev. J. L.
Yearick, thus recognizing an ov
er ruling Providence in all the
affairs of life. Kev. Edward
Jackson gave a cordial and whole
some address of welcome. Mr.
J. T. Campbell as leader of the
corps of Institute lecturers re
sponded with a statement of
some of the difficulties that con
front the farmers of Pennsylva
nia, and then introduced the oth
er lecturers of the course, Mr.
J. Stewart Groupe occupied the
first period in a talk on "Twen
ty years experience with Hogs"
Sometime was spent on discuss
ing the difficulties that confront
the hog raisers, as well as some
of the mistakes many farmers
make. A ration' for brood sows
is slop made of bran middlings
and warm water after the pigs
are 24 hours old and then gradu
ally increasing the feed after
wards adding corn to the ration.
In summer a clover pasture
should supplement the grain ra
tion. As an aid to sanitation a
mixture of charcoal ashes black
antinumjandjeopperas and sulphur
should be provided. Large hogs
have no grain ration except corn.
Mr. L 0. Van Noy occupied
the next period, giving his ex
perience with milking machines.
The speaker's opinion of such ma
chines is that they should not be
used except where a large herd
of cows is kept
Wednesday evening session
opened with Mr. Campbells' story
of Woodbine Farm; This is the
story of Mr. Campbell's own life
as a farmer with out money and
only a mortgaed farm to draw a
living from. The speaker em
phasized the value of the farm
for building a fortune as well as
a character. Mrs. Evelyn Binz
was then introduced and gave an
interesting talk on the economic
and civic phases of women's
lives. Mr. Van Noy gave his
talk on "Things worth While."
Much of the speaker's time was
Bpent in telling the farmers how
other big businesses are conduct
ed and how these organizations
work against the interests of the
farmers; and as dairying is one
of the most profitableluies of
farming, it was shown that this
line of farming is doomed unless
the farmers unite to keep the
State tax on oleomargerine.
Thursday morning session. The
Devotional Service was conduct
ed by Rev. Edward Jackson. The
first period was taken by Mr.
Groupe in an interesting talk in
Increasing the Corn Yi6ld."
This is accomplished first by seed
selection, namely, time ofmatur
ity, weight of ear and general
conformation. Cross fertilization
is necessary and is accomplished
by the ear to row method, Bdetas
seling the row selected for seed.
This treatment usually increas
es the crops about 5 per cent
Fertilization is a next requisite
and the speaker, on his own farm
uses ground raw phosphoric rock
applied as an absorbent in the
stables. The manure is carefully
saved, and .all other vegetable
matter, and applied to the. land
intended for the corn crop.
Mr. Van Noy next gave a talk
on silos and silage. '.The speaker
thinks the silo indispensable to
the dairyman, and the very
cheapest method of obtaining
ing food.
Friday afternoon session.
The first period was occupied by
Mr. Campbell in answering of
questions relative to his special
ties. Mr. Groupe, next spoke on
Potato Cultivation as follows:
Seed needs to be of medium Bi'ze
kept in cool cave till near plant
ing time. Depth of five inches
below the level of the field and
covered but lightly and the seed
18 inches in the row.
Cultivation is done with har
row and later with the five tooth
cultivator. A clover sod is prefer
red for potatoes plowed in the fall
and sown down to rye which is
turned down the next spring in
time for the planting of the pota
toes. Manure is applied prefer
ably 18 months previous to the
planting. Mr. Geo. A. Harris
occupied the next period with
an address on Relation of Agri
culture to Banking. Very inter
esting data was given showing
that while in 1887 there was only
$10,000 deposited in Fulton Coun
ty's one bank. At present there
areobout $800,000.00 deposited
in our two banks or about $80 for
each of our inhabitants as good
an average as is found in any like
area in the state. The Rural
Credit Banking Bill was explain
ed in detail and its advantages
noted as well as the offer of the
fact that the State Bankers Agri
cultural Committee has offered
to pay the expenses of two boys
to State College for ' the short
course in Agriculture. Mr. Mc
Clain of Farm Advising Board
wa3 then introduced and spoke
for some time on the work of the
board and reminded our people
that the services of the members
of the Board are at their request
Mrs. Binz conducted a meet
ing for women in aa adjoining
room during this period.
Thursday Evening Session.
Prof. Emory Thomas opened this
session with a talk on Agricul
ture in the Public Schools. Mr.
Thomas reviewed the growth of
the school curriculum to the pres
ent time showing that with the
limited time at the disposal of
the teachers it is probable that
Book Agriculture can hardly be
successfully taught in the Public
School. Some discussion follow
ed after which Miss Ruth Ken
dall gave a most beautiful origi
nal tribute to the life of the
farmer.
Mr. Groupe occupied the last
period of the Institute with a
talk on "Country Life vs. City
Life." The speaker says that
joy is what every one is seeking
and that each of us should have
a goal before him and the impor
tant thing is to know he is right.
With illustrations and compari
sons the speakers showed the
real value of life. Some excel
lent recitations closed the period
and after suitable resolutions
passed the Institute adjourned.

DISTRESSING ACCIDENT.
A Falling: Tree Last Friday Caused (he
Death of Scott H. Knepper, of
Taylor Township.
A most peculiar accident
happened to Mr. Scott H. Knep-
per of Taylor township last Fri
day which resulted in his death
at the Nason hospital at Roaring
Spring, Pa., last Sunday evening.
The circumstances connected
with the sad affair are about as
follows:
Scott II. Knepper, a son of Mr.
and Mrs. David Knepper, was
born August 9, 1882, and at the
time of his death, wa3 aged 34
3 ears, 4 months and 13 days.
Never having married, he had
not left the parental home. He
was a fine specimen of physical
manhood, a good citizen, and as
a side line, paid some attention
to dealing in live stock.
Most of our readers will re
member that last Friday was a
stromy day. In the morning he
told his father that he would go
over to Harry Black's some three
miles distant just across the line
into Huntingdon county, and get
a sheep that he had bargained
for.
His not appearing at home that
evening did not create any seri
ous alarm, as he had remarked to
his father when he left, that if
he did not get the sheep, he
might go farther and look at
some cattle. Learning, incident-
ly, Saturday morning that Scott
had not spent the night at the
place his father expected, he at
once went to the telephone and
found that Scott had been at
Black's Friday, got the sheep,
and started home with it. Mr.
Black told Mr. Knepper over the
phone that he had accompanied
Scott to the Black Bridge over
Sideling Hill creek, and after
having suggested that Scott take
a by-road to his home on account
of the distance being much short
er, Mr. Black returned to his
home. Further inquiry around
the neighborhood by phone re
vealed the fact that Scott had
not been seen since he left Mr.
Black about noon the day before
and had started home on the by
road. Accompanied by his sons at
home, the father went at once to
the point where Scott had enter
ed the by-road, and as there was
snow on the ground, they had no
difficulty in following his and the
sheep's tracks.
After following the trail for
some distance, they found where
a groundhog had crossed the
path. At this point Scott had
tied the sheep to some bushes,
and followed the trail of the
groundhog until he found where
the groundhog had gone into its
burrow. Returning, Scott got
his sheep and went on toward
home. '
The father and sons following
on came to a spot where they
found the sheep in the road pin
ned to the earth by a fallen tree,
Gravest fears for the safety of
Scott were now aroused as they
followed the trail of his footsteps
marked the entire distance by
blood stains. Hastily following
the gruesome trail, through the
woods,' over fences, and through
fields, for a distance of more
than a half mile, they suddenly
came upon the prostrate form of
Scott, lying in the snow, almost
devoid of clothing, frozen, un
conscious, but still alive.
He was taken home, tenderly
cared for, Dr. Campbell summon
ed. When the doctor arrived,
he felt that the chances of sav
ing the life of the unfortunate
man were exceedingly meagre,
but that it might be worth the
effort to take Scott to a hospital.
This was done Sunday, but the
hospital staff found that Scott
had been bo much weakened by
exposure and the loss of blood as
to preclude any thought of an
operation, and he passed away at
5 o'clock Sunday evening.
His remains were brought
home, and the funeral held yea-
State Agricultural Notes.
It is estimated that almost two
million barrels of Pennsylvania
grown apples were shipped to
the New York markets this sea
son and that a larg percentage
was exported.
Farmers clubs and associations
throughout the State are asking
that increased appropriations be
given the Department of Agri
culture for the work of the Farm
ers' Institute and the corps of
Farm Advisers.
It is estimated that there are
about 9,000,000 apple trees in
Pennsylvania.
The 1916 Pennsylvania apple
crop is estimated at 16,932,000
bushels, worth to the growers
$11,513,760.
Every farm crop of the past
season shows an advance in price
over last year with the exception
of hay and in some sections of
apples. The difference in price
in these two products is very
small as compared with a year
ago.
The average yield per acre of
onions showed a decided increase
in the State during the past year.
The average yield was 300 bush
els to an acre,

and apples are being received at

Altoona Man Injured.
Joseph Knotts, of Altoona, was
injured last Saturday when he
fell down the cellarway in A. H.
Whetstone's store.
Mr. Knotts had gone into the
store to secure a box or a crate
in which to ship a turkey. The
trap door to the cellar had been
left open by someone, not an
employe at the store, and before
anyone was aware of Mr. Knotts
danger he fell down the cellar-
way. He received a cut over
the right temple, several body
lacerations and contusions and a
severe abrasion over the right
hip. It is not thought he was
seriously injured. Mr. Knotts
was able to go to Huntingdon in
the afternoon, where he consult
ed a physician, later going to his
home in Altoona. Everett Press.

terday, interment being made at
Center church.
From indication, it is believed
that the violent wind caused a
black oak about ten inches in
diameter to break off about ten
feet above the ground and fall
across the road crushing the
sheep to death and greatly in
juring Scott about the head. It
is believed that as he wandered
away from the spot where the
accident occurred, he was in
a dazed condition and blind, as
he was wandering away from
home and it was seen where he
had run against trees, into bush
es and against other objects.
Almost 24 hours elapsed between
the time of the accident and the
time he was found. All this
time, his wounded body was sub
jected to the violence of a winter
storm.
An Old Newspaper.
Our young friend George A.
Smith, of Ayr township, who is
this winter teaching in Lancaster
County, showed to us on Tues
day a copy of the Bedford Ga
zette that looked good as a relic.
It is a6-column folio, pages 13x21
inches, and was printed in Bed
ford by Charles McDowell on
Friday, October 24, 1828. The
subscription price was $2,50 a
year. Among the curious things
seen in this paper are: National
Republican Ticket: For President
Andrew Jackson; for Vice Presi
dent John C. Calhoun. John
McEldowney, grandfather of Wil
liam McEldowney, living in Bel
fast township, announces him
self a candidate for the office of
County Commissioner.
At a meeting of a respectable
number of citizens of the East
end of Bedford county, friendly
to the present administration of
the United States, convened at
the Stone Schoolhouse in the
borough of McConnellsburg, Sep

maker, Esq., was appointed pres
ident and Eliphalet Smith, a re
maining Revolutionary soldier,
Vice president Captain William
Bishop and George Denig, were
appointed secretaries, when it
was unanimously

Wendel Ott advertise for sale a
valuable farm of 193 acres situate
in Ayr township, 2 miles from
the town of McConnellsburg.
The Gazette which was for
Andy Jackson for president and
of course, against the re-election
of John Quincy Adams, hands
out the following bit of informa
tion : "We are constantly hearing
something about John Q. Adams'
great learning his profound
scholarship &c. but his Trumpet
ers always forget or neglect to
tell us that Old John Adams
Johnny Q's father, applied to
the Senate of the United States
for an appropriation of money to
pay for young John's Education.
The old man gave his son a good
education, in England and then
applied to Congress to pay for
it But here he missed it There
was too much wisdom in Congress
in those days of Roman virtue,
to admit such claims; and Old
Adam was sent off with "a Flea
in his ear," and told to pay for
the education of his son out of
his own pocket as other men did.
A few days ago, Reynolds For
ner, East Extension, McConnells
burg, handed us a copy of the
Fulton Republican published
Thursday, January 9, 1868. Mr.
James Pott was the editor and
proprietor, and the price was
$2.' 0 per annum, if paid strictly
in advance: otherwise, it was
$2.50. Among the professional

DOCTOR AND PATIENT.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene ty
Samuel G. Dixon, H. Li. D
Commissioner of Health.
Do you know how to use a
doctor? When you are ill vou
send for him of course. He has
an automobile to go to see people
who wait so long before seeking
his advice that he must go to
them. He begins by asking all
sorts of questions which may
seem to have little to do with t'he
matter in hand.
Suppose you did go to a ban
quet eat and perhaps drink a
little more than usual. Perhaps
you have been working extra
long hours at the office and nat
urally you haven't had time to
take exercise. Maybe you have
neglected yourself a trifle. The
important thing is, that you are
sick and it is the doctor's business
to give you medicine that will
right all this promptly.
You
and
the
haven't time to stay in bed
he knows it Therefore.
thing for him to do is to
give
you a teaspoonful of somethimg
three times a day before meals
that will set everything straight
forthwith. This is an ordinary
man's conception of a doctor's
duty to his patient.
Now as to the doctor's side of
it When he comes to see a
patient he probably thinks, after
asking questions; here is a man
who works hard, he eats too fast
and too much, neglects to exer
cise, is careless about his daily
habits, feels a little fatigued and
resorts to a nip two or three
times a day to "buck himself up"
his digestive organs are over
worked and what he needs is a
change of habit and modification
of his method of living. A little
rest if I insist upon it a tonic
and some restriction of his diet
for a few, days, will pull him
through this spell. H e will
probably take the medicine I have
prescribed but the advice he will
forget in a week. That's the
doctor's Bide of the case.
Then of course there is the
man or woman who is almost
certain that something is wrong
with them physically. Some of
the bodily functions are not rieht
and they know it but they keep
on because they "haven't time
to be sick." Finally they must
seek advice and then the doctor
discovers that there is some pro
found organic disturbance that
may have gone so far that he is
helpless to aid.
If you are going to build a
house ycu call in an architect
who acts as your adviser, makes
your plans and sees that they are
carried out If you are going
into a bus;ness deal, your lawyer
draws up the contract, sees that
your interests are protected and
advises you how to proceed.
But your doctor you call in when
the damage is done and you ex
pect him to give you something
in a bottle that will undo the
results of weeks, months or years
of indiscretion.
