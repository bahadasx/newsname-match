ENATOR IS
OPPOSED
TO DELAY
Senator Thos. J. O'Neill of this city
is opposed to the postponement of the

gested by dispatches from Oklahoma

committee of members visited the new
capitol which was in course of con
struction and we v.ere then assured
that the legislative chambers could
be ready for occupancy upon th'rtv
days' notice to the con t:-. l i
the senator. "Many months have
elapsed since that time and I' see no
reason why at least that portion of
the building set aside for the legisla
ture should not be, ready for use. If it
is not ready now it should be within a
very short time.
"There are many matters demanding
prompt attention at the hands of the
legislators and I am not in favor of
delaying the session." Senator O'Neill
planned to go to Oklahoma City this

W. L. Hightower, Charged with
Arrives from Dallas and
Explains Situation
Theft,
HAD TOLD BAGLEY
WHERE CAR WAS
Higlitowcr Not Son of Minister and was
Only Employed by Phillips to
Sell Bibles
Declaring Uiat his arrest was the
result of a misunderstanding and re-
gretting that the warrant was served
just as he was signing up a contract
for a good po: ition with a Dallas firm.
V. L. Highlower arrived hero this
morning from Dallas in charge of Dep
uty Tidwell and was lodged in tho
county Jnil.
The prisoner in an interview with a
representative of tho Daily Express ex
plained that he had no more connec
tion with the Bagley car than an out
sider. He was working for Phillips,
who represented the A. J. Holman
publishing house of Philadelpria, and
was selling bibles. He was being paid
by Phillips for this work but had quit
him last week to accept a position
traveling man in Oklahoma for the
Texas-Oklahoma phonograph company
a rtV-iv We Dallas concern.
IHghtower declared that tho Foul
car, was left at Bradley for repairs it
having broken down enroute, and that
Phillips continued his work in a bug
gy, instructing Hightower to come to
Chickasha to notify Bagley what had
happened to his Ford and where he
could find his car, which Hightower
did.
Sheriff Bailey this morning tele
phoned to Bradley as directed by
Hightower and found that what High
tower said was truo and that the car
had been In a livery stable there all
the time. The owner of the stable
said there were $19 charges against the
auto but Hightower knew nothing of
this. "
"All that I did in the matter was
open and above board," he declared,
"I was working for Phillips and came
to B"'- n deliver his message as
"Levied. ' had nothing in the world
to do with renting the car. That was
done by Phillips who mado the pay
ments direct to Bagley. Even if there
had been anything wrong, and there
absolutely was not, I could have had
no connection with it.
"WThen I left hero to take my new
position I left my address with several
people, my friends, who were glad that
I had landed something better."
Hightower is not the son of Rev.
Emmett Hightower of Fort Worth as
reported.

$9,000 A
YEAR SAVED
BY MOTOR
Chickasha Advanced Froiii Place 4 1-2
to Place 4 in Fire Bureau Rating
for New Year
HOPES TO MOTORIZE
FIRE DEPARTMENT
Willi Saving of $9,000 a Year by Addi
tfca of Fire Engine Immense Sav
ing fould Be Made
That tho saving afforded by the new
fire insurance rating for Chickasha
will pay for tho $9,000 motor fire truck
In a single year Is the estimate made
by Councilman II. O. Hayes, chairman
of the lire and water committee, who
is also in the fire insurance and real
estate business.
Councilman Hayes Is in receipt of
(he new key rate which determines the
firor insurance rates to prevail in the
business section of every city in the
state of Oklahoma. This Is gotten out
yearly by tho Underwriters Bureau.
In tho new book Chickasha is ad
vanced from her former place, 41,4 to
4. Tho rates range from one to six
with Intermediate halt numbers. It
is equivalent, thoreforo, to being
moved up from ninth to eighth place
with the first place enjoying the low
est fire premium rates,
"While tills rate only affects the
business districts," said Mr. Hayes to
day, "for residence sections we have
the lowest minimum rate for tho state
of Oklahoma, sixty cents per hundred
on frame buildings.
"What tho advanced rating meanso
property holders may ue judged frohi
(ho yollowlng estimates: Take for in
stance tho Kozy theater. The pre
mium rate on this building for years
has been $5.45 on tho $100 valuation.
Under the new rating it Is only $3.00.
The average saving is over a dollar on
a hundred. Lot us say that the block
in which the Kozy la situated is in
sured for $100,000, which is far below
tho actual figure. The saving to those
owners alone in a year would be over
$1,000.
"I'm sure that the addition of the
$9,000 fire engine will save its cost in
premiums every year Jtnd I hope the
day is not far off when the entire fire
department, at both engine houses, will
be motorized. This could be done at
a cost of about $2500 and the saving
on tho maintenance of horses would be
great and Immediate. The $9,000 mo
tor truck was added without bonding
the city and, In fact, up to date at
least, without making any tax levy.
It will probably be paid without an ad
ditional levy and the city will be at
least $9,00 a year ahead."
Councilman Hayes made a hard and
long fight for the new motor ruck, do
daring that its purchase would be a
great saving to tho citizens and the
new rate book substantiates all that he
has declared about it In tho council
rooms during tho past two years.

Francisco Gulindo, a Mexican farmer
from Norge, was held over without ball
by Judge Fuller yesterday afternoon
to await the action of tho district court
for tho killing of Tomas Aldaba in
Chickasha on Christmas Day.
Great Interest was manifested by he

defense but the case for the Btate was
equally hotly contested by Prosecuting
Attorney Venable and Judge Holding.
The testimony of Jose Negrete, the
principal stato witness, wati practically
the same as whs published In the Dally
Express on Tuesdty. He stated that
the deceased had entered the store and
had ordered chile and sardines. Af
ter concluding the meal Galindo enter
ed and insulted Touias Tomas" dd
not reply to it..
Weighed 230 Pounds
The deceased was a mail of about
five feet ten and weighed about 230
pounds. Galindo, according to tho
witness, again insulted him and draw
ing his weapon shot Tomas through
the body. The two men then grappled,
bue Negrete saw no knife in Tomas
hand.
- Lying in Wait
Three witnesses were brought iz T.'uO
testified that the deceased and his
brother-in-law, a few nights previous
to tho tragedy, were seen Standing in.
the doorway of the restaurant of Juan
Trevino on Second and Chickasha
avenue. The brother-in-law had a
knife which Tomas took from him and
placed in his bosom. A dishwasher,
knowing of the difficulty between
Francisco Galindo and Tomas, warned
Galindo, who was in the restaurant, of
the presence of danger and advised
him to escape, which he did.
Had Threatened Life
Other witnesses testified that tho de
ceased had threatened to kill Galindo
and saying he would dance a jig on
Gallndo's dead body.
Juan Trevino testified that tor a
week before the tragedy the deceased
was seen drunk in ChicVasha.
Fired Three Times
Charlie Masoner and Buck Powell
testified hat they had gone into Ne
grete's place at 418 South Second
street to get a plate of chile and that
after their entrance Tomas was the
first to speak. Tomas had risen from
his chair and in his hand some glitter
ing instrument resembling a knife,
though they did not see the handle.
When Tomas arose Galindo started to
shoot, the first ba!l entering his ene
my's body. Then the men grappled.
When they had broken away Galindo
again fciiot and later fired a third shot.
Saw Knife in Hand
Officer Lee Tuck saw Tomas lying
on the floor on his left side after the
shooting with a knife in his hand and
almost under him.
Surrendered to Officer
The testimony showed that Galindo
wi the last to come out of Negrete's
place and that when he did so and saw
the officers he dropped his gun to a
hanging position on his finger and
! threw up his hands as an act of sur
render.
Shot Three Time
