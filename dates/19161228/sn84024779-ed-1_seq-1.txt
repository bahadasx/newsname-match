SOCIETY PAYS FOR
LONG WORKDAY
I hear and read the outgivings
of Many Eminent Minds about an
Eight-Hour d)ay and they all
seem to proceed upon the theory
that eight hours for a day's work
is a recent invention, a leap in
the dark, a daring experiment and
nobody knows what may come of
it.
As a matter of fact it is so old
it makes Bunker Hill monume.iiL
look like thing of yesterday. It
existed before the ten-hour day
the twelve hour day or the four
teen-hour day. Four hundred
years ago among our forefathers
an eight-hour dav was the rule
and standard.
If there had been no change in
the way we produce things, eight
hours would probably be the
standard today, and anybody that
wanted to shorten it would be look
ed up as a demagogue and revolu
tionist.
It was only because we had an
enormous increase in the pres
sure for production, particularly
since the introduction of factor
ies and steam, that he work-.ng
day was ever lengthened it .l
life came to mean for the worker
nothing but toil and sleep.
In modern times the increase
in labor saving machiery should
have offset all that. The aver
age factory hand or transporation
worker now is 200 or 300 times
as efficient as the average worker
of 75 years ago, but he is no bet
tef- off. The huge increase in his
output or effectiveness hasn't
shortened his hours.
This is plainly wrong. It is
rottenly and intolerably wrong.
It is dangerously wrong
for the community. The eight
hour movement seeks to set it
right.
The eight-hour idea means
something to the worker, but a
lot more to the rest of society.
See how this is. Up to 1847
women and children worked 16
hours a day, or something like
that, in the Welsh coal mines.
Women, harnessed like cat'le,
dragged from the mines great
baskets
at
coal. There was a
board in the cenier of the run
away with cleats nailed upon it.
Bent far over their heads almost
to the ground, the women brac
ed their feet, against these cleats
and tugged at their loads.
Most of them were unsexed by
their toil. Nature mercifullv
made them incapable of bearing
children. The rest, if tli^y had
offspring, brought forth idiots.
The little children that worked
in the mines were so injured or
brutalized that they grew up
either criminal- of strange types
or imbeciles.
Society had to pay for all this
and pay appalling costs. is
paying for them still.
Yet when it was proposed to do
no more than to mitigate some of
its worst features, mine owners
violently protested and said they
would be ruined.
In this case of the Welsh coal
mines the government determined
to risk the ruin and reduced the
hours of labor.
After a time observers were
astonished to see that social con
ditions improved, general intel
ligence rose, good order increased
and the general welfare grew in
porportion as the working hours
were shortened.
There has been the same ex
prience wherever the thing has
been tried.
In the olden days, when one
man made a pair of shoes, let us
say, he could) exercise his mind
and please his taste in designing
and creating them.
In these davs to stand all day
turning- a piece of metal back and
forth, or lending a machine that
custs out leather heels is to flat
ten the mind, pervert the soul
and darken the life.
The more people you have
working these hours at these
deadly employments, the worse
for the average condition of the
population, which is the only na
tional strength.
II skills strange to be arguing
these things in America.
Sixty years have passed since
Australia adopted the eight-hour
day April 21, 1856, was the day.
In Australia it is celebrated now
as a kind of Fourth of July—a
day of national freedom a id
greatness.
In the United States we are
till talking about it, more or less.
"The glorious spirit of American
progress" go.es rather lame when
you think of that

PRICE MUCH REDUCED
The subscription price of the
Journal is greatly reduced this
year. In fhe past we have
charged from three to six bushels
potatoes for a year's subscription,
while now. we charge only one
bushel. We have seen the time
when a bushel of white beans
would scarcely pay for a year's
subscription, while now the same
quantity will pay for four years.
A sack of flour would pay for the
paper a little over a year back in
the nineties, while now we give
the paper between three and four
years for hundred weight of
(lour. So vMI see the paper is
very cheap. Now is fhe time to
subscribe.—Kenmare Journal.

skipped another fellow of whom

THE BEST LAYERS
The early hatched pullet is the
one that lays the winter eggs, ac
cording to Mr. Pettcrson, poultry
man at the North Dakota Experi
ment Station. The late hatched
pullet does not mature before
winter and is apt to be a winter
loafer instead' of a winter layer.
Hens over two years old do not
lay many eggs, and they are more
apt to be diseased and hence dis
ease carriers. Secure the early
hatched) pullet, feed it well and
swat the old hen if you want
wi iter eggs.
