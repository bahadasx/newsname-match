the Great Beyond.
Sunday evening, December 24th
Henry Butler, an acred pioneer,
died at his home in Eagar. He
was born June 15th, 1844, at Red-
burn, Herefordshire, England.
Mr. Butler spent the larger and
best part of his life in Arizona,
coming to St. Johns about the
year 1880, where he remained un
til some fifteen years ago, when
he moved with his family to
Round Valley. He has always
been a man who tilled the soil for
a livelihood snd many has been
the battle he has had with the
elements and the many reverses
that he met with were endured
with patience -and with a heart
that was willing to try it again.
He leaves a wife and ten child
ren to mourn for him. All of the
children are. married except the
youngest agirl the children are
all. well respected and good men
and women. Mr. Butle r was al
ways a minute man in the L. D.
S. Church in which his standing
is counted among the best ever
ready to go and to do what was
asked of him . He was a quiet,
unassuming man, a friend to all
and was ever ready to do a friend
ly act. His memory will long be
revered by the people of St. Johns
and Eagar and his family will al
ways remember him as a kind and'
loving husband and father.
The funeral services were held
yesterday at 11 o'clock a., m., at
the Eagar Assembly hall where
a large audience gathered to pay
their last respect to the deceased.
Many fitting remarks were made
by the speakers. The remains
were interred in the Hillside cemetery.

and was under the directed of
Mrs. Winn.

head of his "Studie" up Christ
mas day andthe"gol-darn-thing"
bolted. None of the occupants
were injured to any great extent,
but we would give several thous
and for the "movie" rights of the
scramble to get out of the car.
If Springerville citizens live
through Christmas, New Years
and Fourth of July, they are safe
for the balance of the year.
Rev. Miller of Presbyterian
Church in Springerville has re
ceived a letter from Dr. Dixon,
Secretary of the Board of Home
Missions congratulating him upon
his good work for righteousness.
Dr. Dixon was at one time in fav
or of abandoning the Church here,
but owing to the efforts of Mr.
Miller the Church will remain in
this field and Mr. Miller will be
retained in the pulpit, until such
time as he desires to leave.

Danger Signal .
If the fire bell should ring
would you run and stop it or go
help to put out the fire? It is
much the same way with a cough
A cough is a danger signal as
much as a fire bell. You should
no more try to supress it than to
stop a fire bell when it is ringing
but should cure the disease that
causes the coughing. This can
nearly always be done by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
Many have used it with the most
beneficial results. It is especially
valuable for the persistent cough
that so often follows a bad cold
or an attack of the grip. Mrs.
Thomas Beeching, Andrews, Ind.
writes: 'During the winter my
husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy is the best
medicine for breaking up these
attacks and you cannot get him
to take any other." Obtainable
