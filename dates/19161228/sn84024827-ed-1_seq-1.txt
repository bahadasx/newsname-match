banks were announced today by
the farm loan board and it is ex-
pected that within sixty days the
new system will be in operation,

Stock subscription books of the

Farmers to Dominate
Temporary directors, five to each
bank, will be named, probably within
the next three weeks, by the board.
As soon as the banks have been organ
ized and borrowers have subscribed
to $200,000 of the stock of each bank,
the temporary directors will surrender
their authority to boards of nine di
rectors each, six of whom will be
named by the farmer borrowers and
three by the farm loan board. The
permanent directors will serve three
years and receive per diem compensa
tion, as in the case of the federal re
serve bank director.
Location Explained
In designating locations for the
banks, the board was guided chiefly
by the needs of rural sections. This
has resulted in placing only two of
the 12 banks in New England and
middle Atlantic states, tbe chief cen
ters of population. Three go to the
south, five to the farming states of
the middle west and west, and two to
the Pacific coast.

EL PASO SHIVERS
DEVOID OF COAL
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Dec. 27. There is not a
nound of coal to be bought tonight in
i EI Paso, owing to a shortage that may
continue indefinitely, the dealers say.
The excuse first given by the coal
men when the supply began to grow
short was the scarcity of coal cars on
the railroads connecting with the
mines. But now they say it results
from the scarcity of labor at the mines
Coal has advanced in price from $7.50
to $15 a ton within the past two
months.
The coal shortage, coupled with the
spe1 of frePzine weather, has caused
acute suffering among the poor of the
Mexican quarter. It is not felt in the
arn,y camps, however, where the fuel
is pine wood imnorted from eastern
Texas and New Mexico.
