Washington.- The notes to the belligerents
are prefaced with this in

American ambassadors presenting
them:
"The president directs me to send j
you the following communication to J
he presented immediately to the Minister
of Foreign Affairs of the Government
to which you are accredited."
The text of the notes themselves
then begin identically as follows:
"The President of the United States i
has instructed me to suggest to the '
(here is inserted a designation of the
Government addressed! a course of
action with regard to the present war
which he hopes that the Government !
will take under consideration as sug- ,
gested in the most friendly spirit and j
as coming not only front a friend, hut j
also as coming front the representative
of a neutral nation whose interests
have been most seriously affected by
the war and whose concern for its
oarly necessity to determine how best
to safeguard those interests if the war
Is to continue."
At this pol:?t the texts vary in the
notes to the Central Powers this paragraph
follows next:
"The suggestion which I am Instructed
to make the president has
long had it in mind to offer. Ho is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
a desire to play a part in connection
with the recent overtures of the Central
Powers. It has in fact been in

layed offering it until those overtures
had been independently answered
but for the fart that it also concerns
the question of peace and may
best bo considered in connection with
other propasls which have the same
end In view. The President can only
k sey that his suggestion be considered
entirely on its own merits and as if
It bad been made in other circumstances."
Tn the note to the Entente Allies
the following paragragh takes the
place of the one just quoted:
"The suggestion which I am it*atructed
to make the President has
long had it in mind to offer. lie is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
the recent overtures of the Central
Powers. It is in fact no way associated
with them in its origin and the
President would have delayed offering
It until those overtures had been answered
but for the fact that it also concerns
the question of pence and may
be best considered in connection with
other propasls which have the same
and in view. The President can only
beg that his suggestion be considered
entirely on it sown merits and as if it
had been made in other cironm- !
stances."
Then all the notes proceed idonti- j
rally as follows:
May Take Initiative.
"The President suggests that an i
early occasion be sought to call out 1
from all the nations now at war such
an avowal of their respective views as
to the terms upon which the war |
might be concluded and the arrangoIftka
meats which would tie deemed satisfactory
as a guarantee against its renewal
or. the kindling of any similar
conflict In the future as would make 1
It possible frankly to compare them.
Hi|H He is indifferent as to the means taken
to accomplish this. Tie would he happy
himself to serve, or even to take
the Initiative In its accomplishment, in
env way that might prove acceptable,
but he has no desire to determine the
method or the instrumentality. One
Br way will be as acceptable to him as
r another If only the great object he
has in mind be attained.
"He takes the liberty of calling attention
to the fact that the objects,
which the statesmen of the belligerents
on both sides have in mind in this
war are virtually the same as stated
I In general terms to their own people
Land to make the rights and privileges
of weak peoples and small states as

secure against aggression or denial In
the future as the rights and privileges
or the great and powerful states now
at war. Eac h wishes itself to be made
secure in the future along with all
other nations and peoples, against the
recurrence of wars like this and
against aggression of selfish interference
of any kind. Each would be
jealous of the formation of any more
rival leagues to preserve an uncertain
balance of power amidst multilying
suspicions;* hut each is ready
to consider the formation of a league
of nations to insure peace a::-i justice
throughout the world. Hefore chat final
step can be taken, however, each
deems it necessary first to settle the
issues of the present war upon terms
which will certainly safeguard the independence,
the territorial integrity
and the political and commercial freedom
of the nations involved.
U. S. Vitally Interested.
"In the measure to he taken to secure
the future peace of the world the
people and the Government of the
I'nited States are as vitally interested
as the Governments now at war.
Their interests, moreover, in the
means to he adopted to relieve the
smaller and weaker people of the
world of the peril of wrong and violence
is as quick and ardent as that
of any tether people or Government.
They stand realy, and even eager, to
co-operate in the accomplishment of
these ends, when the war is over, with
every influence and resource at their
command. Hut the war must first be
concluded. The terms upon which it
is to be concluded they ore not at liberty
to suggest; but the President does
feel that it is right and his duty to
point out their intimate interest in its
conclusion, lest it should presently be
too late to acmomplish the greater
things which lie beyond its conclusion,
lest the situation Of neutral nations,
now exceedingly hard to endu
be rendered altogether intolerable.
and lest, more than all, an injury
be done civilization itself which
can never be atoned for or repaired.
"The President therefore feels altogether
justified in suggesting an immediate
opportunity for a comparison
of views as to the terms which must
precede those ultimate arrangements
for the peace of the world, which all
desire and in which the neutral nations
as well as those at war are ready
to play their full responsible part. If
the contest must continue to proceed
towards undefined ends by slow attrition
until the one group of belligerents
or the other is exhausted, if million
after million of human lives must
continue to he offered up until on the j
one side or the other there are no
more to offer, if resentments must be
kindled that can never cool and despairs
engendered from which there
can be no recovery, hopes of peace
and of the willing concert of free
puopies win tie renaereu vula and Idle.
"The life of the entire world haa
been profoundly affected. Every part
of the great family of mankind has
felt the burden and terror ??f this unprecedented
contest of arms. No nation
in the civilized world can be said
in truth to stand outside its influence
or to be safe agninst its disturbing
effects. And yet the concrete objects
for which It is being waged have
never been definitely stated.
"The leaders of the several belligerents
have, as has been said, stated
those objects in general terms. But
stated in general terms they seem the
same on both sides. Never yet have
the authoritative spokesman of either
side avowed the precise objects which
would if attained, satisfy them and
their people that the war had been
fought out. The world has been left
to conjecture what definite results,
what actual exchnnge of guarantees,
what political or territorial changos
or readjustments, what stage of miltarv
success ever would bring the war
to an end.
"It may be that peace is nearer than
we know; that the terms which the
belligerents on the one side and on
the other would deem it necessary to
insist upon are not so irreconcilable
an some have feared; that an interchange
of views would clear the way
at lenst for conference and make the
permanent concord of the nations I
iHipe for the immediate future, a concert
of nations immediately practicable.
"The President is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering mediation.
lie is merely proposing that
soundings he taken in order that we
may learn the neutral nations with |
the belligerents, how near the haven
of peace may be for which all mankind
longs with an intense and increasing
longing. He believes that the spirit
in which he speaks and the objects
which he seeks will be understood by
all concerned and he confidently hopes
for a response which will bring a new
light into the affairs of the world."

n Discussing Present System Major
General Scott Tells House Military
Committee Bill Wi I Be Ready During
Next Month.
Washington.?A definite plan for
universal military training will he laid
before Congress next month in the
shape of a bill formulated by the General
StaiT of the Army, accompanied
by complete estimation of cost as
compared to the present volunteer system.
Major General Scott, chief of
staff, told the House Military Com
nuttee that the work was in progress
and would require about a month to
complete.
In response to a laughing question
as to who would introduce it in the
House. Representative Kahti of t'ali
fornia, said:
"And I would he glad to have the
honor to introduce it."
General Scott was subjected to sharp
cross-examination 011 his reiterated
recommendat ion for u universal service
measure based in part on results
of the volunteer system as shown In
th' mobilization of the National Guard
for border service.
Representative Tilson. himself a
colonel in the National Guard, following
General Scott's repeated assertion
that the federalization of the National
Guard would not meet the country's
military needs, said:
"I agree with you that voluntary
military service is not an adequate }
system and probably would break |
down in time of war as Tt has 'lone
before. The National Guard system in
particular is economically unwise because
of the dual control of the forces
by the Federal Government and the
State." ^
Taking dtP report on the mobilization
of thtt iguard Representative
Tilson then assed:
"Don't you think that in view of the 1
enormously greater task of the regular
service as the agent which con
ducted the mobilization, the regular
array fell down harder in proportion
than the National Guard."
"We make many criticisms of our- .
selves," Geeral Scott said, adding that
a report on the Array's share in the
mobilization already had been asked
for and would be presented.
"That is what. 1 want to appear in
this record," said Representative Tilson,
"because I want to show that no
set of officers, no matter how well
trained, could make this National :
Guard system work."
W. J. BRYAN APPROVES
APPEAL FOR PEACE.
Lengthy Wire Sent Wilson by Former
State "Secretary Congratulating
Him Upon Efforts to End Wad.
Washington.?President Wilson re
reived a telegram from former Secretary
Bryan congratulating him on his
note to the belligerents. It said:
"You have rendered an invaluable
service to a war-stricken world in asking
the belligerent nations to set forth
in specific terms the concessions and
assurances which they deem necessary
to the establishment of a lasting
peace. It would be a reflection upon
the nations at war to doubt that they
know the ends for which they are
fighting or to assume that they have
any purposes which they are unwilling
to reveal.
"A definite statement by both sides, i
no matter how far these statements
may he apart, will dear the air ana
afford a basis for negotiations and
when negotiations begin they are not
likely to terminate until an agreement \
la reached, because neither side will
consent to assuni" respostbility for
continuing the unspeakable horrors of i
this oontliet. if any reasonable terms j
can be cesured.
"Accept cordial congratulations and
my earnest wish for the success of the 1
movement which you have hail the
honor to inaugurate."

OF NEW PREMIER
LLOYD-GEORGE.
ASK COMPLETE RESTITUTION
Only Peace Terms That Wi.' Be Considered
Says Lloyd-George is Complete
Restitution, Full Reparatior
and Effective Guarantees.
London.?The announcement in the
House of Commons hy David Llovd
George, the new Prime Minister, that
the first act of his Administrat'on,
was the rejection of the proposal ol
the Central Powers for u peace con
ference constituted one of the most
momentous scenes which the oldest
Parliamentary veterans had ever wit
nessed.
The new Premier declared that be
fore the Allies could give favorable
consideration to such an invitation
they must know that Germuuy was
prepared to accede to the Allies'
terms, giving "complete restituiun.
full reparation and effectual guarantees"
and to enter a conference upon
the invitation of Germany, proclaiming
serself victorious without any knowledge
of her proposals would bo putting
our heads into a noose with the end ol
the rope in Germany's bands."
Mr. Lloyd-George asserted that at
the moment Germany was penning the
note, assuring her convictions as to
the rights of other Nations, she was
dragging Belgians into slavery. Ho
announced that the note presented
through Washington contained no proposals
of terms, but was a paraphrase
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg'a
speech and that the Allies had separately
concluded to reject it. although
they had informally exchanged views,
and would within a few days present
a joint reply.
Mr. Asquith. the former Premier,
seconded Mr. Llyod George's decision
with even stronger words, and almost

as they appeared on November 9. The
returns of three precincts in the county
not officially reported at that time
were included when the county canvassing

that legislation for a change might be
