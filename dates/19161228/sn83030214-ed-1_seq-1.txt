This is regarded in Entente ami government quar?

the aim of Germany'- warfare?in other words, that ihe
looks on a peace loaffuo a-? a moans of preventing her
victims in this war from attempting at any future time
to rojjain the conquests she may make.
The German government has repeatedly protested
that it was fighting only for the assurance that Ger?
many would never again be attacked by a coalition. She
now proposes to mak?*- peace without receiving this as?
surance.
On tho other hand, the Allies declare they will make
