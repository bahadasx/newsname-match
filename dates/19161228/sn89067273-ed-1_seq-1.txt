All

Tommie began to think just aw

forgotten something, and in less time
than it takes to tell it Tommie had
placed the drum Uncle John bad giv
en him on the brand new coaster, ard
then, after a silent struggle, the new
air:gun was tied to the sled, and
Tommie slipped out the door.'drag-
ging his sled after him. A few min
utes later Old Granny Possum, look
ing out of her hollow-stump home,
saw Tommie pass and heard him say.
"My, but the cold wind does cut a
fellow's face."
Tommie noticed Brother Red Fox's
dainty track in the snow. Brother
Fox is michtv Darticnlsr .Ke,.f
wl
. . . ' """.ting ibis feet n Ihe snow. He puts his
right hind foot in the track of the left
hind-foot In the track of the left
front one and his left hind-foot In
that of the right foot, so you see he
has a path for two of his feet. There
was urotner Kabbtt's track, two In
front and one behind, only the two
front tracks are his hind-feet. Fun
ny way for a rabbit to travel, but
Tommie understood. There WAPA
Muskrat's tracks, flvo toes on each
foot, only he leaves the print of tour
toes behind
"Looks like they are trying to fool
a fellow," said Tommie to himself,
"Father says you can tell what kind
of a fellow you are by the tracks you
make. He says that the fellow who
will steal walks on his toes, like Bro.
Fox, and a fellow that will work
snradilln. hi. fi ,,,1 iu, n,, n.i

Squirrel, and a fellow who is cross
Mike a bear, always drags his feel
et
and kicks up the snow In a slovenly
way, and is sure to be a boy who
doesn't help mother; a fellow that
sneaks, turns his toes in. like Slim
Weasel."
T imtnio looked so happy that Mrs.
I'os.-uin told Sister Coon, and Sister
ji'oon told Brother Xight-Hawk. You
know everybody loves to spread good
news, and before morning every lit
!e friend of Tommie In the forest

When the children went out to

there on the front porch was the
most gaily painted sled, a box of
"Uts and candy, an air-gun with a
fierce bear painted on the nock,
and a note, which the older of tho
