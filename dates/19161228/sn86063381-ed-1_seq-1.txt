BY COMMITTEE OF
THE CITY COUNCIL
^President Lycan Calls Attention to
Conditions as They Have Been
Reported to Exist.
WELLS GO DRY DURING THE
RECENT DALTON BLAZE
City Purchases Wood Question of
Cleaning Snow From Walks Conies
Up for Consideration.
"Bemidji's water supply plant is not
the best of shape, and to be per
fectly frank about it in poor con
dition.
This, in substance, was the
statement made in the city council
last evening by President Lycan of
the council and the matter is to be
looked into with the view of remedy
ing the present conditions. To this
end the superintendent of the water
system and the fire and water com
mittee of the council were instructed
to make an investigation and report
~to the council at its next meeting.
Water Plant Bad.
President Lycan asserted that'he
had been informed the pumps and
wells were not all they should be and
urged immediate action. It wast
brought out that this same matter
had been up several times but that
nothing tangible ever came out of
the calling attention to the status of
the plant The wells are choked, it is
said, and the pumps are not doing
the work they should. The new wells
are not producing what was expected
and in the matter of the recent fire
whifch swept the Dalton building out
of existence it was known to some
"in the know" that the wells were
pumped dry and this* was also men
tioned in the discussion last evening.
Looks to Future.
"Some day the city will have two
fires at the same time and then we
will be up against it," was a com
ment of President Lycan.
It might also be mentioned that
in the bills presented for allowance
it was disclosed the Dalton fire "ost

Chief Doran of the fire department
asked for two new fire hose nozzles,
two dozen gaskets and three dozen
rings and the city clerk was instruct
ed to purchase them, the chief to
designate what was desired. The
new nozzles are to replace two that
are practically out of commission, it
was stated.
Walk Cleaning Up.
The council had scarcely taken
their steats when Mayor Vandersluis
broached the question of clearing the
sidewalks of snow, he specifying the
need for such action along vacant
lots, vacant improved property and
walks not so prominent as others.
"There is an ordinance covering
that," ejaculated President Lycan.
"But it doesn't seem to be en
forced," replied the mayor.
"The city has such an ordinance
and that provision is* included in all
leasesthe removal of snow and all
other obstructions," came back Presi
dent Lycan. "If it isn't done, it is
a lien against the property," he
added.
It was mentioned that the steel
scraper was being repaired and that
the city should have additional fa
cilities for caring for the snow.
PATIENT IS RECOVERING.
Mrs. Dahleen, who underwent an
operation at St. Anthony's hospital a
week ago, isi recovering and expects
to leave that institution in a few
days.
Mystery Pelt Returned To

Everybody nearly has heard of the
"sheep in wolf's clothing" but Deputy
County Auditor Alsop is evidently of
the opinion that saying might be
given a more modern version to read
"dog in wolfs clothing He hasn't
said so in so manv words, perhaps,
but when asked by a Pioneer rep
resentative what became of the "mys

in a nook of the county auditor's of
fice for the past several days, Deputy
Alsop merely smiled and replied "It's

"And I haven't heard another word
from it," interposed County Auditor
George.
In the course of events there ar
rived at the auditor's office a pelt al
leged to have been a wolf hide, for
which the usual wolf bounty was evi
dently expected, but when Deputy Al

Also the course of events there
was wont daily to' call at the office
persons who are supposed to be ex

ted the "stranger." The discussions
that ensued were oft times animated
and earnest but at no time did Mr.
Alsop participate. He would again
wrap up the "mystery" and return to
his books. After the rounds had
practically been completed and all
had had their say, Mr. Alsop quietly
wrapped up the hide more securely,
placed thereon an address and took
it to the postoffice.
And the Pioneer representative has
a sneaking idea it wouldn't do for
some one to try to sell Mr. Alsop a
rotten head of cabbage lor a water

PASTOR WARFORD PREACHES
SERMON AT CASS LAKE
Rev. Lester P. Warford, pastor of
the Presbyterian church of this city,
went to Cass Lake yesterday where
he preached the opening sermon last
evening at an evangelical meeting.
This is the first of a series of meet
ings to be held in Cass Lake during
the next two weeks*. Rev. Baselle
is pastor of the Presbyterian church
in Cass Lake.
Bemidji awoke this morning with
another ward added to its corporate
limits and two new representatives
added to its city council. The new
ward is the Fifth, formerly Nymore,
and its representatives in the city's
aldermanic body are O. J. Tagley and
Fred Brinkman.
Two more aldermen were also
elected by the city council last eve
ning to fill vacancies, John Moberg
being named to represent the Third
ward and Paul Foucault will occupy
the vacant seat in the Fourth. Mr.
Moberg for several years* sat in a
First ward seat and moved to the
Third. Mr. Foucault found himself
in the Fourth precinct in a new ward
division and his election was merely
a case of resigning the Third ward
aldermanship and being seated as
representing the Fourth, he not hav
ing to move his residence in making
the change.
Changes Quietly Made.
The selection of the new aldermen
from the Fifth (Nymore) precinct
and the steating of the others was
done without a ripple.
The resignation of Alderman Fou
cault from the Third was first read
and accepted. Alderman Smart moved
the nomination of Mr. Foucault for
the vacancy that existed in the
Fourth. Alderman Miller moved that
the selection be made unanimous and
his motion carried as put.
For the vacancy in the Third, the
seat that had been occupied by Alder
man Foucault, Alderman Phillippi
placed the name of O. B. Stevens in
nomination and Alderman Smart
nominated John Moberg. The bal
loting showed Mr.* Moberg with five
votes to his credit and Mr. Stevens
with two and Mr. Moberg was given
the seat.
FjfihJ&ajtf Selection..
The naming of the aldermen from
the new Fifth ward started when
Alderman Ervin nominated O. J. Tag
ley. Alderman Smart placed Fred
Brinkman's* name in the running and
Alderman Lahr sponsored J. W.
Smith. At the meeting was H. C.
Blackburn from the Fifth and he was
asked if he knew of any sentiment
in the Fifth for the naming of any
certain Fifth ward resident as its
representative. He replied that he
did not but that so far as he was
concerned he favored Mr. Smith. Mr.
Blackburn is boiler inspector for the
M. & I. railroad and Mr. Smith is
roundhouse foreman for the M. & I.
road.

Terms of Service.
The shakeup in the council, so far
as the rearrangement is concerned,
means, according to City Attorney
P. J. Russell, for the unexpired terms
of the regularly elected aldermen.
This is held to mean that Alderman
Moberg will serve in the Third un
til a year from next March and Al
derman Foucault's term will expire
next March.
The selection of the new Fifth
ward representatives by the council
will hold until next municipal
election when of the candidates in
the race the two highest in the bal
loting will be the choice, the one
receiving the most votes to serve
the long term and the second highest
taking the short term. This was also
given as the offhand legal opinion
of the city attorney to questioning
on the part of a Pioneer representa
tive as to the status of the new alder
men and the added changes in the
council body.
