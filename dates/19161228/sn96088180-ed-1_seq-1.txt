SINKING OF THE
DELTQ JUSTIFIED
111 GERMAN REPLY
; Berlin, via Sayvllle, Dee. II.
Germany's answer to American in
quiries aa to the sinking of the Nor
wegian steamship Delto (or Delta)
as transmitted to Ambassador Oerard
today, Justifies sinking of that vessel,
on the ground that ahe waa violating
neutrality and dismisses the conten
tion that bar passengers were Jeop
ardised aa unjustified.
The German reply follows:
"After Investigations made tfy Ger
man naval authorltlea, the ahlp Del
to, chartered by the Italian govern
ment for transportation of coal, waa
topped October IS of this year about
40 sea mllea southeast of Cap Poloa
and sunk by artillery fire fof assist
ing tbe enemy la a way contrary to
neutrality" and here the German
I government eltes article forty-six,
tflrst paragraph, line A three of the
! London war law declaration.
"After the German commander
lisd, taken the shlp'a papers and
jciused the crew to go Into the boats,
; ha'f an hour waa given the crew
I to leave the ahlp. The weat'.er waa
, fcooil and very bright with Mireme
(ly low sea, The boitt had ti travel
joM. short way to tlitf Spanish
coast, so that the usual security was
given for the crew's safety. Tbe
conjecture expressed by tbe Amer
ican government that the life of Am
erican cltlsens that might have been
i aboard the Delto waa endangered.
J therefore la not Justified."

Washington, Dec. 28. Germaay'a
answer to President Wilson's pea
not reached the state department to

receipt of tho reply said nothing
confidential was attached to the an
swer. There had been suggestion
that Germany might give her terms
secretly la a message to Ambassador
Gerard for transmission her.
The atate department cable office
notified Secretary Lansing of receipt
of the message about 10 o'clock and
Immediately provided him and Pres
ident Wilson with copies. Secretary
Lansing bad purposely avoided study
of th note aa contained la press re
ports ao bis mind would be clear
on the exact points mad by Ger
many and not confused by any pos
sible ml statements In press texts.
The official copy waa understood.
however, to conform In all essentials
with the jqress versions.
Secwtary' Lansing gave out th
text, which waa practically identical
with that sent to the press by wire
less. London, Dec. 28. Despatch of tho
allies' reply to Germany's peace prof
fers Is imminent. Information today
Indicated that the phraseology ot th
Identical notes, to be sent by all th
entente natlona, had practically been
settled upon.
Russia's reply couched In th
terms, agreed upon by the allies
already la en route to Paris, where
It will be handed the American am
bassador with France's note, for
transmission to Berlin some tlma
within the next few days.
From authoritative sources, the
United Press 1 earns the allied not
will contain:
A rejection of a peace based on
German-made plans.
A vigorous worded summary ot
tbe principles tor which the allies
allege they are fighting for to re
move the menace of militarism, of
might over right, of the rule ot force
over International law.
Probably the allies will make still
clearer their alms and purposes by a
recital of the "crimes" tor which
they purpose to hold Germany re
sponsible. The note, however, will not state
specifically the terms on which th
allies will consent to talk peace,
such terms must be lnferentlally
drawn from ths statement ot the.
alms and guarantees for which the
alltea contend they are fighting.
It will not admit the timeliness of
the German plea, nor ot President
Wilson's suggestion.
At the earn time these allied notea
go forward to the central powers,
through the diplomatic agents ot
Spain, Switzerland and the United
States, the alltea probably will for
ward an Identical not answering
President Wilson's peace suggestions.
This American note Is likely to point
to the German reply and elaborate
somewhat In meeting the American
president's plea for a statement of
principles. Probably also it wfll em
phasise the importance to America
ot th establishment, eventually, ot
a peace of such permanence as to
prevent all recurrence In the future
of another such world dlatrubnaoa,

tion today.
