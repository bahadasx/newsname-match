BELLIGERENTS REPLY
TO PRESIDENT WILSON.
SUGGEST CONFERENCE Off" WARRING
NATIONS IN NEUTRAL
CITY TO DISCUSS PEACE.
Berlin, Dec 25?Germany and her
allies, Austria-Hungary, x Bulgaria
and Turkey, today replied to the npte
of President Wilson, in which he asked
the belligerent nations to state the
aims for which they were fighting.
The proposal is made by the Central
Powers that a conference of del
egates cf all the belligerents ne neia
immediately in some neutral city.
The task of preventing future wars,
the official statement says, can be begun
only after the end of the present
struggle.
The answer, which also contains
the reply of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,
and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded suggestion
made by the President of the United
States of America in order to create
a basis for lasting peace has been received
and considered by the Imperial
government in the friendly spirit
which was expressed in the President's
communication.
*"Tho Prpcirlon t noints out that jvhich
he has at heart and leaves open the
choice of roads
"To the imperial government an
^ exchange of views seems the most
appropriate road to reach desired
results.
"We, therefore, suggest an immediate
meeting of delegates of the beligerent
States at a neutral place.
"The imperial government is also of
the opinion that the great work of
preventing future wars can be begun
only after the end of the present
struggle of tlte nations.
"It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure
to collaborate entirely with the
^t aiTmted States in this exalted task."
The answer of the Central Powers
concludes with the usual diplomatic
terms "bf politeness.

Unique Test of Honesty.
1
Dr Riley has proved that the people
of this town are more than honest.
Every visitor to nis store was attracted
to the notice stuck up in a
box on one of the out of the way
counters reading "Stamps, help yourself
and make the change." It has
been the custom for generations for
the drug stores to keep stamps for the
accommodation of the public after
j postoffice hours, and the fact tfcat
j the stamps were there was not a surj
prise, but the fact that the customer
j was to wait on himself, and take out
! what he wanted, make his own
, change and go his way rejoicing.
| The opportunity was a tempting
one for any customer not strictly honest,
for he had every advantage, but
1 not only did the Riley DrugComoany
; not lose anything, but in the week
that they have tried the plan they
have come out two cents ahead, in,
stead of being short changed, some
1 |
customer thought that in getting
; stamps that way the necessary four
cents on the two letters was worth a
I penny interest to the drug store.
Dr Riley, being a man with great
i faith in his fellow man. and no small
degree of brotherly love is delighted
j with the success of his plan, though
i it was not primarily intended as a
test for the honesty of the people of
the city.? Fhrewe Time*.

OF PRESIDENT WILSON'S RECENT
COMMUNICATION.
Washington, December 26:?Ger
' * n ?? J ? i. nr;i
many s repiy 10 rresiaeni wusuus
I note is regarded here as having ad?
vanced the peace movement another
step despite the fact that it disapi
pointed in meeting his suggestion
for an avowal of terms. f
The reception .that Germany's reply
receives among the entente al:
lies whose statesmen have publicly
' declared against such a programme,
' now becomes a point upon which a
' further move is hinged. The Geri
man note probably is the prelude to
a series of carefully considered delicate
moves in the great game of
; world diplomacy, all possibly leading
i: to an approach for a real discussion j
of Deace terms on grounds which all i
the belligerents may feel can place
them at no disadvantage.
This is the official view of Ger- j
many's reply so far as it has been |
formulated on the basis of the un
official text. The official copy had <
; not been received to night and President
Wilson was keeping his mind (
open.
] Neutral diplomatic quarters, too, ]
regarded the fl&it as a step toward {
peace and rather leaned to the view
: that Germany might follow it with ,
ja confidential communication of
I some sort outlining her terms. ,
, i The view of the entente embasj
sies, frankly expressed, was that the
i note was not an-onswer to President
Wilson's communication, but rather
a document for circulation in Ger(
many and in neutral countries with
the object of moulding opinion to
.1 place the responsibility for continu|
ing the war on the entente.
. j Among the Germanic diplomats
the only, expressed view was one of
i surprise that the reply preceded re,
ceipt of the entente's reply to Ger|
many's original peace proposal of
, j December 12.
I It was everywhere agreed that
the principal sticking point was the
lack of a definite statement of terms '
such as President Wilson asked and
such as Lloyd George declared the j
allies would require if they were!
, not to put their heads in a "noose
i with a rope end in the hands of the
i'
j German." It is not beyond the
! realm of diplomacy, however, to!
find a way to bridge the difficulty :
and Germany's failure is not yet re-!
, | | '
garded as a block to the negotiations
although it makes them exceedingly !
difficult.
Germany's declaration that she j
regards the work of securing the
world against future wars as a work
to be taken up after the present'
conflict is ended was regarded with
a diversity of opinion.
Officials who turned back and j
'compared the statement with1
phrases of President Wilson's note!
did not find the two out of harmony'
nor in disagreement with the President's
public utterances on a world
league to preserve peace; yet there j
i ?1_i_ ? 1 ? j |
was an inaennauie upunuu auiuau m
official quarters that the ending of
the war and the safeguarding of
peace of tee future were joint problems
so inseparable that one dependI
ed on the other. Those taking this
view referred to Lloyd George's
declaration that the allies would ,
| consider it possible to enter a coni
ference only if Germany would i
first openly offer "reparation, re-1
stitution and guarantees."

Darlington Man Killed By Anto. ^

the Philadelphia section of Darling-ra
ton County.
He was returning home with his 0
wife from a call on her parents, and
when opposite old Bethel, on the 0
road from Lydia to Bonsai, he found t
it neccessary to pass to drive - close s
to a ditch. ^
Fearing his automobile would fall
into the ditch, he stopped the engine. c
Getting out, he cranked the encine, r
and it fired and at once started for- v
ward, as it had been left in high gear. a
Mr Yarborough made a desperate
attempt tostop the machine. His chin f
was caught and his neck was broken, t
A brother who had followed him, c;
though the road was out of his way, came
up soon alter the-accident and
took the widow into his car. The
dead man was taken home.
A Dastardly Crime.
As the "Carolina Special" was
pjlling out from the station here
Sunday night a bystander discovered
a crosstie jammed into one of
the trucks of a Pullman, and called
the attention of the crew to the
fact. The train was stopped and
the tie removed after some fifteen
minutes hard work. Investigation j
showed that two crossties had been j
placed on the track between Dorchester
and Ridgeville. The engine
evidently threw one tie from the
track, but the other was picked up
by a truck of a Pullman and was
securely wedged in the truck and
brought a distance of some fifteen
miles. Fortunatelv, and wonderful
it is tnat no serious aamage was |
done to the train or the truck. It
was a narrow escape from a serious
wreck.
After the tie was removed the
train ran off and left Flagman Warren,
who had been sent back to
guard the rear of the train, and he
was forced to spend the night in
Summerville.
Detectives are investigating the
matter, and it is hoped that they
will be able to bag the miscreantwho

lame Warden In Jasper Shot by
Poachers, it is Believed.
Ridgeland, Dec 24?W D Thomas,
ne of the wood? riders for the Okee?e
club, was found dead late Friday 1
fternoon about ten miles from here
i Savannah river swamps with three
uckshot in his head. Wednesday
fternoon he left his home to make (
is usual rounds in the woods to try ]
nd keep off poachers and as he had <
t times been in the habit of spending |
he night at the club house, nothing 1
;as thought of his failure to return, j
Vhen he failed to return Thursday!!
lis family became alarmed at his ab- ;
ence, and searching parties were <
ormed to look for him intheswamps. i
..ate Friday afternoon his body was j
ound, still astride the horse that he j
iad been riding, the horse also hav- |
rig been killed with buckshot. 1
From all appearances it seems that 11
ie rode upon poachers who had just |
illed a fine deer, the dead deer be- 1
ag found within about 100 yards of (
rhere the body was found. Rather ]
han to submit to arrest one of the!'
loachers fired a load of buckshot at '
Ir Thomas' head, killing him and.
lis horse instantly, as it was shown ! <
t the inquest yesterday morning !'<
hat shot had penetrated the brains I
f both man and horse. '
Evidently Mr Thomas was unaware j j
f the presence of the poachers, as 1 j
he pistol he carried was still in all
mall bag that he always carried tied :'
o his saddle. '
Mr Thomas was a man of fine t
haracter and known and liked by | {
nost every man in the county. He ,
.as about 55 years of age and leates f

Lake City. December 26:?News
>f a homicide reached us from Hannah,
this county, where it is report- ' ||'
?d that C Wilbur Daniels was shot
by his brother, Anderson Daniels.
a'hilo rho rurvirte u r*-? / nr.fli/?tinor it 1
appears that Anderson had warned
him some time ago not to marry
Miss Vera Gaskins, and when on
Sunday afternoon he brought his
wife to the home of Anderson Daniels,
with whom hp was living since
the death of his father, neither his
brother or wife noticed them, which
treatment angered him, and he, with
pistol in hand, went to the room of
lis brother and proci eded to club
lim with the pistol till he was taken
>ut by another brother. Later, as
le was entering the front door, he
was shot in the stomach, from which
ie died Monday morning. \
Shortly after he was shot he made
i statement which would clear his
slayer, but it is reported that he
stated to some parties who were with
lim after the shooting that he wa9
>nly returning to the house to apol)gize
to his brother, and that he did
lot even have a pocketknife with
lim at that time. After examining
:he wound Dr McLeod told him that
le could not live, to which he replied:
"I do not hate to die, but I'
did not think it was wrong to marry
he girl I loved." He made his will
ind gave definite instructions with
eference to settling his affairs, one
iccount of which he enumerated be ng
only for a dime, showing clearl y
hat he was in his right mind. H is
