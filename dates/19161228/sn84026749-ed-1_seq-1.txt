Instead of the fair weather pre
dicted for Washington today by the

The failure of the weather to run
true to form, It was said by the fore

WILSON 60 TODAY, '
BUT DOESN'T LOOK IT
President's Outdoor Activities
Give Him Youthful
Appearance.
President Wilson Is sixty years old
today. From a "close-up"' view he
looks at least ten years younger. A
side view of the Chief Executive us
"he stepped almost Jauntily through
the corridor leading from the White
House to his offices gave him the
appearance of a man about half his
three score.
According to Dr. Cary T, Grayson,
the President's private physician,
President Wilson never waa In better
health. Plenty of outdoor exercise
la what haa kept him fit. Dr. Gray
son says.
Scores of Telegrams.
Scores of letters and telegrams
were received at thn White House to
day congratulating thn President on
his birthday.
Among the rongratulatory mesa
agea were cablegrams from European
emperors and kings, but the texts of
these messages are withheld from
publication.
President Wilson celebrated his
birthday tfy taking a complete rest
He gave word that no official en
gagemonLa-wara to be. made for the
day. (The President with Mrs. Wilson
and the holiday White House guesta
had a family luncheon, and planned a
quiet family dinner tonight with no
guests except members of the Im
mediate families.
Health Greatly Improve-
A deluge of rain prevented his usual
game of golf with Mrs. Wilson, and
he spent the .forenoon quietly with
hope, of an automobile ride this af
ternoon. Three years ago the President waa
reported from time to time as being
In a bsd physical condition. He con
tinually suffered from colds, which
held on tenaciously. Walking and
golfing have driven away hlr predis
position to colds and added weight
gives him the appearance of perfect
health.
SLUMP IN MARRIAGES
Cupid Palls to Keep Up Pact He
Started Friday.
There waa a decided slump In the
Washington "marriage market" to
day. The movement which set In
early Friday morning and caused Col.
William A. Kroll and Col. W. P. Rele
to work overtime Issuing licenses to
wed, suffered a severe reversal of
form, either because of trie rain or
other causes unknown.
Fifty-four coiiples obtained licenses
on Tuesday, twenty-seven were given
permits to Journey to the altar yes
terday, and today, well, to use the
words of Cupid's chief aid, Colonel
Kroll, "tho love spell Is over for o
while."
"How long will It remain dormant"
the colonel waa asked.
"You can never tell how, when or
why love Is or will be," h,e philo
sophically replied.

MEXICAN ENVOY
WITHDRAWN BY
GEN.CARRANZA
Due to Failure to Send Fletcher
to Mexloo, Says
Embassy..
LUIS CABRERA IN CAPITAL
Impression Prevails Carranza's
Answer Is Not a Flat
Rejection.
Ellseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador-designate
to the United States,
haa been recalled from his post by
General Carranta. He will leave
Washington some time today or to
morrow. '
Ilamon P. Megrl, Mexican consul
general at San Francisco haa been
designated by Carxanxa to nerve as
charge daffalres oT the embassy, pend
ing the appointment of a new am
bassador. According to authoritative Infor
mation the aotlon was taken by Car
ransa entirely apartfrom the sltna
tlon created by Carranxa's unwilling
ness to sign the border protocol, and
was due to the persistent failure of
the United States to accept the cre
dential or Arredondo an a full-fledged
ambassador- and to nend Henry P.
Fletcher, who was designated a year
ago as ambassador to Mexico, to
Maxlco City.
The Mexican embassy Issued a de
nial of thn story that Mr. Arredondo
ws leaving because of the protocol
deadlock. It la not understood, how
ever, that the denial waa Intended to
dispute thn fact, admitted at the
State Department that Mr. Arredondo
will leave.
Cabrera Brlnga Answer.
Thn development nerved today to
emphasize thn growing seriousness
of the relations between the two gov
ernments. Lula Cabrera, chairman
of the Mexican section of the Joint
commission, la In the city today, pre
sumably for the purpose qf present
ing Carranta'a reply to the request of
thn commission that he approve the
protocol,
Secretary of the Interior I-ane, chair
man of the American section of thn
commission, has waited all day to
hear from Mr. Cabrera, but up to 1
o'clock the latter had not called.
Moreover, Mr. Cabrera denied himself
to all callers.
The Impression prevails In Mexican
embassy circles that the reply Is not
a flat rejection of the protocol, but
discloses an effort on the part, of
Carransa to keep the negotiations gu
Ing without agreeing to the main
featurea of the proposed agreement.
Administration Disturbed.
The Administration Is greatly dis
turbed by recent events, but It hsd
hoped to receive a conciliatory note
from Carransa In reply to the de
mands which tho American commis
sioners made to the Mexican commis
sion two weeks ago.
They are satisfied that Carransa
haa decided to rebuff this Government
by making some political play against
the United States with the hope of
offsetting the loss of prestlgo which
he Is sustaining atmost dally In the
northern section of the country
through the activities of Villa.
That some political move may serve
Carransa, at least among the few fol
lowers he has gathered around him In
Mexico City, Is accepted by those fa
miliar with the workings of the
Mexican mind. They appear to be
lieve he Is convinced that President
Wilson's patience la nearly exhausted,
and that ho may again rally Mexlcana
about him by Insulting the "Orlngo."
Soon after Carranxa waa recogjilsed
last year Arredondo waa appointed
ambaaaador designate. In that capa
city he has received great considera

READY TO CUT OUT "PORK"
Wilson to Veto Three Bills Unless
First Pruned.
The so-called "pork barrel" rlplets
the publlo buildings, flood reclama
tion, and rivers and harbors bills
are dun for a cold reception If'thevl
are loft on the White House door
steps, It was learned today. Owing
to the tremendous needs for revenue
during the next fiscal year the Presi
dent and Secretary of the Treasury
McAdoo are determined, It la declared,
to prune tho "pork barrel" measures
to the limit. If theyq are passed In
their present form and sent to the
White Jlouse for approval It la de.
clared the Preaident will veto them.
It is probable the Administration's
vjew on these measures will be ex
plained In some form If the expected
fight In Congress over them threatens
to tie up other legislation.
The President himself let It be
known today that he In opposed to
the publlo building bill as It now
stands.

VIOLATED PLEDGES SEEN
End of Diplomatic Relation!
Called Necessary Unless.
Hostilities Stop Soon.
CASE OF ARABIA IS CITED
Sinking Described as Flagrant
Breach of Promise Made
- by the Wllhelmstrasaa.
Strong Intimations were given to
day to The Times that If tha peaie
negotiations collapse, as Is now fear
ed, and Germany does not quickly
come forward with a satisfactory ex
planation, of recent submarine inci
dents, dlplomatlo relations between
the United States and Germany will
be severed.
These intimations were given by
high officials of the State Depart
ment, whose Information heretoforo
haa been unfailingly accurate.
It had been suggested previously,
of course, that President Wilson's ev
.prehensions concerning the course
which German submr.rlne tactics have,
been taking recent! was tha princi
pal Impulse which caused him to
make hla audden and spectacular
move for peace In Europe.
Delnlte Hint.
In the first cf the two contradic
tory explanations given on December
21 by Secretary Lansing concerning
the President's peace note USat In
which the Secretary stated that the
United filatee waa approachlnfr -the
"verge of war' a somewhat more
definite hint waa given of what was
behind the American peoce proposals.
Today the Information obtained
from high quartera makes It certain
that President Wilson feels that un
its peace la brought about, or un
less Germany once and for all aban.
dons her submarine tactics, tMbre Is
no course rrt to this Government but
to sever dlplomatlo relations. To do
leas, he Is said to realise, would be
to make his warning to Germany In
the Sussex note last April redlculous.
Warning In flnaaex Note.
In that communication the Amer
ican Government sajd: ,
If It U still the purpose of the
Imperial government to prosecute
relentless and Indiscriminate war
fare agalna,t vessels of commerce
by the use of submarines, without
regard to what the Government of
the United States must consider
the sacrd and Indisputable rules
of International law and the unl
varsally recognised dictates of hu
inanity, the Government of the
United States Is at last forced to
the conclusion that there la but one
cours It can pursue, '
Unless the Imperial government
should' now Immediately declare
and effect an abandonment of Its
present methods of submarine war
fare against passengsr and freight
carrying vessels, the Government
of tho United States can have no
choice but lo sever dlplomatlo rela
tlons with the German Empire alto.
gther. This action the Govern
ment of the United Statea contem
plates with the greatest reluctance,
but feels contsralned to take In be
half of humanity and the rights of
neutral nations.
Clumsy JustlScatlon.
Although In response to that note
the German government declared, and
promised to effect, an abandonment of
the tactics complained of. Stale De
partment officials declared today that
there Is no quetslnn that, frorna care
ful examination of all the circum
stances In connection with the recent'
submarine cases, and particularly the
Arabia case, the Herman government
haa not only failed to effect an aban
donment, but seeks In clumsy fashion
to justify her failure.
"In these circumstances," declared
one high official of the department to
day, "It would foe abaured for the
United States to proceed with another
exchange of format notes. There
would seem to be but one course open;
namely, the carrying out of the threat
lit tha Sussex note, unless Germany
promptly, and of her own ascord, re.
pudlatea the recent attacks and gives
