MERRY XMAS
Last Sunday was a great day of ac
tivity in and around the K. P. hall,
the occasion being the assembling and
distribution by the K. P. lodge of
Christmas cheer among the unfortunate
in our community, and all afternoon
the jitq^ys of J. A. Martin and W. W.
Davis could be seen running around de
livering good things.
Groceries, clothing and coal were dis
tributed among 23 families, according
to their immediate needs. The total
value of the gifts being more thau $300,
the committee of the lodge spending
$215, the balance being contributed in
merchandise by Pearson & Co., Biethau,
Bowles ft Mack, Alexander, Blackfoot
Milling Co and E. M. Hubbell.
The items were as follows; Groc
eries, $144; Clothing, $117; meat, $15;
coal, $12; toys, $11; school books, $4.
It is a source of surprise that there
ftssli be so many families in this city
in dire need, and something should be
done at once towards putting some of
these families in a better position. We
appreciate deeply what the K. P. lodge
has done, but such help is necessarily
temporary, and after a short time
the recipients of the Christmas gifts will
be in the same condition again. Some
thing should be done and done at once.
Card of Thanks.
Athenian Lodge No. 44, K. of P.,
desires to thank all those who so gen
sf*. erously contributed to its Christmas
fund, and assures them that every cent
helped to gladden the hearts of those
who, but for this timely aid, would have
had a dreary, bitter, sad Christmas.

of the guards who turned in their

at the prison.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH
President Joseph F. Smith of the Mor
mon chureh celebrated his 78th birth
day in Salt Lake City NovemberlS.
He received felicitations from all sec
tions of the United States and from
all foreign countries, where his work
is well known uni) where bis influence
as a builder has been recognized.
At the family gathering held in the
afternoon President Smith enjoyed
ilv, including 63 of hia'78 grandchildren.
In the evening he received officials of
the church and prominent citizens at
his residence, the Beehive house.
The followng appreciation of Presi
dent Smith ws written by a personal
friend :
''Born November 13, 1838, at Far
West, Caldwell county, Mo., President
Joseph F. Smith's cradle was adver
sity and his tutor was poverty and re
ligious persecution. His mother was
one of the great pioneer heroines of the
Mormon church. His inherited loyalty
and courage taguht him the value of
patieuee and endurance. He drove one
of his mother's ox teams across the
plains and entered with her into this
valley September. 23, 1848. Plowing,
harvesting and woodehopping hardened
his muscles and taught him resourcefuf
uess and initiative.
' ' He started out on a mission when
but 15 years of age, assisting to repair
the ship in which it was intended that
he and fellow missionaries would be
transported to the Sandwich Islands.
He labored there for four years, fill
ing several other missions there in later
periods of life. He has filled missions
in Europe also, presiding there for a
long term in his early manhood. Not
only did he serve his church assiduous
ly', but he was an active member of
the Salt Lake municipal council for
several terms and urged the dedication
of Liberty park to the city, and later
Pioneer square was also purchased
through bis efforts.
' ' He served in the legislative assem
bly, and during one session he acted
as the president of tliesenate—or ** coun
cil." He also was president of the
constitutional convention held in 1882.
' ' He served in every capacity in
his own church from a deacon to the
president of the church and was coun
selor to the first presidency in the
administration of Presidents Taylor,
Woodruff and Snow. The 15 years of
his own adminstration have been most
fruitful in constructive measures. School
buildings and churches, both at home
and abroad, have been built under his
policy. Land has been purchased, meet
houses bought or built, not only in our
intermountain states and Utah, but also
in Chicago, the eastern states, southern
states, California, Sandwich Islands,
Europe and Mexico.
''He is a patron of the arts and sci
ences and is devoted to the cause of
education for the young. Home indus
try claims his deep allegiance. He is
a good Republican and rigidly' encour
ages all forms of home industry and
sustains home manufacture in every
sense of the word.
"Among other public utilities which
he has fostered is our great heating
and lighting systt-ius, the street car
service und the splendid gymnaisum,
built for both the church and schools
in this city and for those in other parts
of the church. His wise, conservative
financial policy is demoustrated in the
successful banks, stores and institu
tions of which he is the head. He is a
foe to debt and obligations of all kinds.
Among the activities of his adminis
tration the Hotel Utah will be mon
unients to his liberal views; the beauti
ful church office building now nearing
completion, unsurpassed for design and
construction in the west; the L. D. S.
hospital and other public structures all
testify to his constructive powers.

ALLEGED GAMBLES« ARRESTED.
Last Saturday night Sheriff Sim
mons made a raid on room 47 of the
Cottage hotel, where he found ten in
mates, seven of whom were arrested,
«barged with gambling. They were ali
men of good family connections and
next day each pleadod not guilty and
put up $50 bail to appear for trial next
week. One of the defendants hailing
from Firth, promised to plead guilty
tomorrow and get the clemency of the
law. The county attorney was willing
to give them the minimum fine of $100
if they would plead guilty last Tues
day, but they refused. If they stand
trial and are convicted, the fine can
not be less than $200 with a jail sen
tence- in connection. Mrs. Ashton is
very indigant that they should um
her house for such an illegal purpose
and has appealed to the county attorney
for protection. She says the room was
hired from the night clerk by one of
tfo; alleged gamblers, who wanted a
room with two beds. The room has
also a back door by which the arrested

A WHITE CHRI8TMA8.
Christmas was ushered in with a
beautiful snow storm and all day long
sleigh riders had ten inches of frozen
enow to jingle their merry bells. All
the churches had appropriate and well
attended services, and all our citizens
seemed to enjoy the day in their res
pective and happy homes, eating Christ
mas dinners, and making merry. The
unfortunate few whose finances were
insufficient for much Christmas cheer
were not overlooked if they were dis
covered by the Knights of Pity, who
scoured the city thoroughly fior needy
and worthy poor and made their Christ
mas as cheerful and happy as money
and the necessaries, and even the lux
uries, of life could possibly do so. This
must humane and Christianlike act of
the Knights of Pythias is worthy of
the highest praise as it is typical of
the only true Christian spirit that man
can possibly display.
"So many gods, so many creeds,
So many paths that wind and wind,
When just the art of being kind,
la all this sad world needs."
W. H. Bean of Pocatello was

for the next two years. There were a
number of applicants for the position
but Mr. DeKay haa the strongest pull
and got the appointment. Saturday

the congratulations of many of his
friends. Warden Snook, who has held
the position since Jits. 11. Brady was

successor will resume the duties of ward

now on the job familarizing himself
with the duties of warden.

Mrs. Frank DeKay leaves tomorrow
for Boise where she will prepare to
commence her duties of matron of the
state penitentiary over which her hus
band has beeti appointed warden. As
a matron Mrs. DeKay will no doubt
be a success as she is an intelligent,
philanthropic and conscientious woman

to the unfortunate inmates of that in
stitution as any woman we know of,
and the state is fortunate in having
secured her services. The salary of
the warden and matron is $2400 per
annum.
