TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS-
Every kern tfcat goes into the makeup of The Times has more than doubled
n cost in the past few yean. In addition to this all forms of living expens
es have also neaily doubled. These conditions make an increase in our
rates for both subscription And advertising absolutely necessary to enable us
to exist without a loss. If every subscriber should pay cash at the old rate
of subscription, based on die present cost -of producing the paper, we would
lose $ 1 66 per year, and our time in. getting It out. To overcome this loss
we have raised the subscription price of the paper to ONE DOLLAR
per year, and no subscriptions after Jan. 1,191 7' will be received for less
than that amount But In order to equalize matters as much as possible.we
will accept subscriptions to The Times at 75 cents per year until Jan. I st
If you- desire to save 25 cents on your 1917 subscription, see that the pa
per is paid for before Jan. I st, as positively after that date no subscriptions
will be, received for less than one dollar per year. Until Jan. 1st, 75 cents.
