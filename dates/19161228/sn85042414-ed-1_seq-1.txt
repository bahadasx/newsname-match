COURT'S DECISION
NOT TO BE HALTED
Managers to Decline to En
ter into Any Alliance
With Unions.
New York, Dec. 28.—The National
Conference Committee of railroad
managers and representatives of the
ployes resumed here today their con
ference relative to the application of
the Adamson law in the event that it
la held constitutional by the United
States supreme court.
Through an agreement between
Attorney Gregory and the railroad
attorneys the effectiveness of the Ad
amson law has been suspended pend
ing the outcome of the test suit.
Therefore, on January 1, the employes
will continue their work without any
Immediate benefit from the law, which
was to have gone into operation on
that day.
The railroads, it is understood, will
not withdraw the suit or permit any
thing to halt the decision of the court.
It was stated also that the railroad
managers would decline to enter into
any allegiance with the unions, in re
turn for their support, in the effort
to defeat President Wilson's proposed
policy of compulsory investigation of
labor disputes. The railroads also will
decline, it was stated, to co-operate in
any way to have the Adamson law re
pealed.
A possible outcome of today's con
ference was the appointment of a
Joint board to determine the opera
tions of the law if its constitutionality
is established.

MARINA CASE
IS HELD UP
Settlement Delayed Pend
ing Receipt of Further
Word from Washington.
Berlin, Dec. 28.—(Via London.)—
The replies of the German govern
ment to another of the American in-
by
submarines, In this instance re
lating to the destruction of the Nor
wegian steamship Delto, with Ameri
cans in the crew, declares that the
steamship was chartered for trans
port purposes to a belligerent gov
ernment and hence its destruction was
legitimate.
This reply which has been deliv
ered to the American embassy says
that so far as was possible the safety
of the crew was provided for. The
men were given half an hour in which
to enter the boats. The weather was
clear and the distance to the shore
was not excessive.
The settlement of the Marina case,
which hinges on the question whether
the steamship was a government
transport, is being delayed pending
receipt of further "advices from Wash
ington.
The American government has
transmitted for information two
statements from the British govern
ment claiming that the vessel was
engaged in carrying horses as part
of its cargo on eastbound voj-ages,
but was under no engagement for
westbound trips and, therefore, could
not be regarded as a transport. Ger
many is waiting to learn what inter
pretation the American government
gives these sentiments.
There have been no further de
velopments in the case of the Arabia.

German Papers Also Say
Lloyd George and Briand
Must Apologize.
Berlin, Dec. 27. Via London, Dec.
28.—^-Germany's answer to President
Wilson's and the promptness wltlj
which it was made has caused general
comment in the press. Only .the anti
American newspapers show a ten
dency to dissent and express the' view
that interference of any kind by
America is Intolerable. The latter
papers find a certain satisfaction in
the proposals that delegates of the
belligerents meet on neutral territory
which is clearly interpreted as ex
cluding the participation of neutrals
In the conference.
Count von Reventlow, while avoid
ing a direct attack on the German
answer, assumes -that no German del
egates will be found willing to take
a seat at the same table with Eng
lish and French delegates after the
recent speeches of Premiers -Lloyd
George and Briand, or until those
speeches are apologized for.
The Taegllcherundschau says that
the note emphatically .rejects the par-
ticipatlon of neutrals in a peace con
ference, which. It thinks, would un
duly prolong negotiations beside dis
turbing the natural' determining
forces. It believes that the German
people will approve the proposals in
the German note' that the question
of league to enforce peace be post
poned until after a settlement of the
present war. It reasons that by pur
suing such' a course the problem- of
permanent world peace can be dealt
with by an assembly Iti which all the
nations of the world can take a share.
Comment on
Berlin, Dec. 27,' via London, Dec. 28.
-—The .promptness with which. Ger
many' replied to .President Mllaon'a
note-is emphasised Inthe comments
of the Berlin newspapers. The Morgen
Post, says that Germany's speedy an
swer should show President Wilson
that, his note was appreciated "ac
cording to its merits."
..' The Boursen Zeltung, the Tageblatt
and the Vorwaerts also called atten
tion to the quickness of the German
response as.a favorable factor in con
trast, with the delay of the entente.
The papers, however, do not reach
optimistic ..conclusion* based on the
exchange of notes. The Lokal Anselg
er says that it .has not even a'remote
belief that the .allies jr|ll send dele

Message Was Deliver
ed Today.
Washington, Dea 28, -Germany, It
was made known here today, will not
permit the road to peace negotiations
to be blocked by a refusal of the en
tente belligerents to enter a confer
ence without prior knowledge of her
terms. It has been forecast that the
entente powers would base a refusal
on such a condition.
The central powers are represent*
ed as willing to permit a confidential
exchange of broad tentative terms
through President Wilson, should It
become necessary to do bo to bridge
the gap which threatens to prevent a
gathering of peace delegates. There
were broad intimations today that a
statement of this position by Germany
either had been communicated to the
United States government or soon
would be.
Germany, it waa said, la looking
to the United States to put forth ev
ery effort to bring about a peace con
ference and to that end Is willing
to consider any suggestion from the
president. As the case stands now,
the German government considers it
has met all the suggestions in the
president's note and a statement to
that effect has been made by Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor.
Germany never has bettered that
