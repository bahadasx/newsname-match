THE SPEAKERSHIP
The Minneapolis Chamber of" Com-
merce Very Active Against
Charles H. Warner.
*Wet" and "Dry" Issue a Fake Issue
Warner Promises the Farm-
ers a Square Deal.
St. Paul, Dec. 27, 1916.
How easily the dear people can be
fooled! Many good souls in the rural
-districts have believed that the "wet"
and "dry" question was the main issue
involved in the election of a speaker
and the organization of the House,
and the interests, with an ax to grind,
or rather the henchmen of those in
terests, have industriously cultivated
this belief. It is another case of
stealing the livery of heaven in which
to serve the devil.
In plain terms the Minneapolis
Chamber of Commerce is prostituting
the cause of temperance to further
the ends of the gang of parasites, with
headquarters in Minneapolis, who have
amassed colossal fortunes at the ex
pense of the grain-growers of Minne
sota and the Dakotas.
It is absolutely certain that the
Chamber does not want Charles H.
Warner to organize the house. Why?
I is a long story and I cannot even
touch the high spots. For years the
grain-raisers of Minnesota have had
grievances that they wished to have
^redressed and that ought to have been
Redressed years ago. It is not neces
sary to go into details. Suffice it to
say that the ele\ator men and grain
gamblers have always manipulated
things so that nothing has been ac
complished in the way of remedial leg
islation.
At the last session of the legisla
ture the chairman ol the Grain and
"Warehouse committee was L. A. Lyd
iard, a Minneapolis lawyer. Mr. Lyd
iard is not a bad fellow, but his sym
pathies were not with the farmers.
The idea of a lawyer heading a
farmers' committee, and especially a
lawyer who was known to be in close
touch with men diametrically opposed
"to the interests of the farmers! What
would the lawyers think of a farmer
ufoT chairman of the Judiciary commit
tee
There were hearings galore before
Mr. Lydiard's committee last session
in fact, it was all hearings. The ob
ject seemed to be to kill time and as
a result nothing was accomplished
no remedial legislation was enacted.
Now again the Chamber of Com
merce and its henchmen are busy, very
busy. They care nothing about tem
perance legislation. It is a cloak un
ier which they are working to further
their own mercenary ends. Some of
the wettest of the wet members of the
Bouse are hand in glove with them.
It is not necessary to mention names.
How does Mr. Warner stand as be
tween the grain-growers and the Min
neapolis parasites Here is how he
stands. I quote his own language:
"If I am chosen Speaker a good ma
jority of the House Committee on
Grain and Warehouses shall be com
posed of bona fide farmers and the
chairman of that committee shall be
a bona fide farmer."
There is no ambiguity Mr. War
ner's statement. Farmers of Minne
sota, do not be fooled. Do you want
a man for Speaker who will give you
a square deal? One who will not
pack committees against you? If so,
instruct your representatives to vote
for Charles H. Warner.

H. S. Alumni Game.
The Princeton high school basket
ball team and the Alumni staged one
of the most interesting contests ever
seen on the local floor at the Armory
Tuesday evening, and a large and en
thusiastic gathering of fans witnessed
the game. The Alumni won, but by
a margin so narrow that honors were
pretty evenly divided between the win
ners and losers. The final count was
22 to 21.
The high school displayed a com
plete reversal of form from the show
ing of Friday evening, and scintillated
in all departments of play, being par
ticularly clever in passing.
Play started at 9:12 with Tom Olsen
acting as referee. The high school
had the edge during the first half and
negotiated three field goals and four
free throws for a total of ten points.
Four field goals netted the Alumni
ajgkt points for this period.
\The last half was a hummer and the
f/a sides contested on almost even
terms throughout. At times they
were tied, and interest was keen dur
ing the entire period. The Alumni
tossed seven field goals to five field

the high school.

last half.
The Christmas Exercises.
Christmas was observed with ap
propriate exercises in the various
churches of Princeton.
At St. Edward's church, which was
decorated for the occasion in ever
greens and flowers, solemn high mass
was held at 6 o'clock Christmas morn
ing. Rev. Fr. Willenbrink delivered
an inspiring sermon, and special music
was furnished by the choir.
The Methodist Sunday school held
its annual Christmas program in the
church Sunday evening, and a pleas
ing program was carried out. Christ
mas trees were in evidence, and the
interior of the church was tastefully
decorated with bells. The little folks
in attendance were each given a pres
ent.
A Christmas party given by the
Bible school at Allen's hall featured
the Congregational observance. A
splendid program of songs and recita
tions was carried out, and the Christ
mas spirit predominated.
The exercises of the Swedish Luth
eran church on the evening of Christ
mas day attracted a large congrega
tion. A program, especially prepared
for the occasion, was rendered, and
the participants did very well.
Will Hold Big Meet.
Minnesota's great group of 1,250
farmers' clubs will hold its second an
nual meeting at University Farm, St.
Paul, January 2, 3, and 4, and during
this time will make a special study of
the subject of farm loans under the
new federal farm loan act.
The meeting will be held during
Farmers' and Home-Makers' Week,
which is expected to bring at least
2,000 to University Farm, so that the
farmers' club group, of the Minnesota
State Federation of Farmers' Clubs as
it is known, will be very largely ai
tendfd.
L. H. Bugbee, president of the fed
eration, however, has issued a call to
every farmers" club in the state
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1916
+o
send at least one representative. In
this call he says that the first years
work of the organization has pointed
out great possibilities of development,
and that the meeting should be large
ly attended in order that the federa
tion may take steps to meet oppor
tunities, and further that it may make
a careful study of the new federal
farm loan act. The call closes with
the words:
"Every farmers' club should take
an interest in this coming meeting."
Two Changes at Court House.
The first of the year will see only
two changes in the official family at
the court house, when Clerk of Court
King will retire to be succeeded by
Mr. H. A. Garrison. Mr. King has
held the office twelve years, and
proved an efficient and accommodating
official. He expects to continue in
the land and loan business, with head
quarters in Princeton. Bob's friends
will miss him around the court house,
but all wish him only success in the
future.
During his tenure of office Mr. King
has always been prominently identified
with the state association of clerks,
and aided in drawing up measures
which, when enacted into law by the
legislature, resulted in greatly bet
tered conditions.
Mr. H. A. Garrison, who was elected
to the office last fall, enjoys the con
fidence and esteem of his acquain
tances in a marked degree, and will
doubtless discharge the duties of his
new position in a manner that will
meet with the approval of the public.
County Commissioner J. F. Warren
of the Fifth district will retire at the
end of the year to be succeeded by
Peter Sehlin of Opstead. Mr. Warren
served his constituents and the county
well. Mr. Sehlin is a progressive
young farmer and will doubtless prove
a valuable member of the board. He
has the qualifications to make a first
class commissioner.

POTATOJITUATION Local Market Quiet and Prices Remain
UnchangedThree Cars Are
Shipped on Tuesday.
Chicago Market Strengthened Last
WeekNotes of Interest to
Growers and Shippers.
The local potato market remains
unchanged as to prices, and no spuds
are being marketed here. The farm
ers have potatoes on hand yet, but
buyers estimate that the bulk of the
crop is out of original hands.
Three cars of potatoes, seed stock,
were shipped from here this week.
There appears to be no demand for
eating stock.
At the present time local buyers
estimate that there are about 200 cars
of tubers (120,000 bushels) stored in
Princeton warehouses. Last year ati
this time the local houses contained
800 cars or more.
It is expected that after the first
of the year a brisker movement will
develop.
The Chicago Market.
Early last week the Chicago potato
market strengthened, and the demand
has shown some improvement. The
call has been for strictly frost-free
stock, and stock that was badly
touched or off as to quality was hard
to move at any price. While the de
mand for the week was somewhat
better than has been prevailing, still it
was not active and operators were not
expecting renewed activity until after
the first of the year.
The cold weather which has pre
vailed has occasioned considerable
trouble on account of frosted cars,
and a good proportion of stock arriv
ing from distant shipping points was
thus affected. Receipts from the
western states have suffered the great
est damage but Minnesota shipments
have also been quite badly affected
cars from near-by sections have also
suffered but in a lesser degree. This
frosted stock was in poor demand and
moved very slowly at prices low in
proportion to the amount of damage.
A good proportion of the cars ar
riving at Chicago have been of stock
from the western states, which have
shipped unusually heavy so far. One
operator returning from that section
'this week states that big inroads had
been made upon the supply and that a
reduction in volume of shipments
might be expected.
Wisconsin Certified Seed Holdings.
About 41,000 bushels of certified
seed potatoes were grown in Wiscon
sin this year. The bulk of this, ac
cording to officials of the Wisconsin
Potato Growers Association, was pro
duced by 80 growers, living in 20 dif
ferent counties and was of the Rural
New Yorker and Green Mountain var
ieties. The remainder of the crop con
sists of Burbanks, Irish Cobblers and
Triumphs.
The average acre yield on the cer
tified stock this year is estimated to
be about 115 bushels. Due to un
favorable weather and various other
conflicting causes, the total of the cer
tified seed potato crop is about 14,000
bushels less than last year. It is,
however, still more than twice the
production of 1914, the initial year of
the certified plan.
It is thought that nearly 80 per cent
of the certified stock raised this year
will be held by the growers for spring
planting purposes. Most of the stock
will probably be used within the state,
despite an increasing outside demand.
New Varieties of Potatoes Developed.
Among other things discussed in
the annual report of the chief of the
Bureau of Plant Industry is an account
of efforts of the government to im
prove potatoes. The report says:
"The department is conducting a
number of potato investigations, chief
ly at Presque Isle, Me., Greely, Colo.
Jerome, Idaho, and Norfolk, Va. One
of the main features of the work is
the development, from seed, of new
varieties of potatoes specially suited
for certain purposes and adapted to
the special growing regions in which
such products can most economically
be produced. A large number of seed
lings have been grown and those of
greatest promise only retained, of
which there are some 300 considered
of sufficient value to warrant further
testing. These are being tried out in
co-operation with the various state
stations, and as soon as they have
proven their worth in any locality ar
rangements will be made to establish
the variety in the region to which it
is best adapted."
Clovers Win.
The Clovers of Minneapolis proved
too strong for the Princeton high
school basket ball team, and romped
off with the long end of a 32 to 9
count in a contest at the Armory Fri
day evening.
The locals started strong and more
than held their own at the outset,
scoring the first five points. But when
the visitors got to going, they ap
peared to be invincible and the ball
was wafted through the net with a
regularity that made the discomfiture
of local enthusiasts decidedly no
ticeable.
The final half was all one way.
Princeton did not play up to form and
a cipher represented its scoring ef
forts, while the Minneapolis lads were
hanging up a record of 20 points.
Several free throws were attempted
by the Orange and Black marksmen
but the ball went wide each time.
The Clovers won the state cham
pionship in the junior division last
year, and they displayed real class
here. Princeton could scarcely ex
pect to win, but the showing in the
last period was somewhat disappoint
ing. The boys will doubtless redeem
themselves, and then some, before the
close of the season. When right they
are good.'
Tom Olsen and a Minneapolis gen
tleman were the officials. Both did
credidable work.
A preliminary contest was staged
between the high school scrubs and
the eighth graders, and it proved in
teresting. The scrubs won, but the
margin separating the two teams was
extremely narrowonly one field
goal. The final cdunt was 19 to 17.
Both sides displayed considerable
"pep" and ability.-
Porter- Anderson.
Mr. Joseph A. Porter of Lewiston,
Mont., and Miss Eleanor V. Anderson
were united in marriage at the home
of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
P. O. Anderson, in this village yester
day morning.
The impressive ring service of the
Methodist Episcopal church was read
by Rev. James A. Geer, at 9 o'clock,
in the presence of immediate relatives.
The wedding march was played by
Mrs. Geer, who also sang, "O, Promise
Me," after the ceremony. The bride
was attired in a handsome gown of
white Georgette crepe.
At t^e conclusion of the ceremony*
congratulations were in order, and
then a bounteous wedding breakfast
was partaken of by the guests.
The groom is well and favorably
known here, having formerly been
employed in a garage at this place.
He is a young man of real worth, and
holds a responsible position with the
Marshall Wells Hardware Co., of Du
luth, being western representative of
that firm. The bride is a young lady
whose winning ways have endeared
her to all. Mr. and Mrs. Porter have
the best wishes of a large circle of
friends for a wedded life of uninter
rupted bliss. They left on the morn
ing train for Montana amid a shower
of rice and felicitations.
Byers-Hastings.
A quiet wedding was solemnized at
the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Ira G.
Stanley Saturday evening at 8 o'clock,
when Rev. James A. Geer of the M. E.
church spoke the words that made Mr.
Leslie G. Byers and Miss Wava B.
Hastings man and wife. The bride
and groom are estimable young peo
ple and their future will indeed be
happy if the well wishes of friends
can make it so.
BONDS, HIGH TAXES, IS PLAN
Congress Must Find Way to Meet
Prospective Deficit.
Washington, Dec. 27.Issuance of
$125,000,000 of Panama canal bonds,
increased income and estate taxes,
additional taxes on whisky, beer,
cigarettes and bottled waters and
higher tariff duties on coffee and tea
are proposed in a tentative program to
be considered by the house ways and
means committee when it begins
framing revenue legislation to meet
the prospective deficit of $370,000,000
at the end of the next fiscal year.
The committee will undertake its
task soon after congress reconvenes
next week. The problem has been
given serious attention by President
Wilson himself.
The president may address con
gress soon to outline how he thinks
the necessary money could be raised.
Trial of Mayor Postponed.
Two Harbors, Minn., Dec. 27.The
trial of Mayor Ernest Strand of
this city, who is also representative
elect, on the charge of accepting
bribes from so called "blind piggers"
while acting as mayor, did not begin
in district court as had been expected.
County Attorney Jelle said it might be
taken up later in the week. Strand
is a Socialist.

RATE 0F_TAXATI0N
Increases Are Made in the Rate of
Taxation for the Villages of
Princeton and Milaca.
Rates in Towns, Villages and School
Districts, Also Comparisons
With Previous Year.
The rate sheet for the county of
Mille Lacs for the year 1916, and com
parisons made with the 1915 rates
makes interesting reading.
The rate of taxation in Milaca vil
lage shows a decided increase over
last year, and the Princeton rate has
also increased. In Milaca village the
total rate for 1915 was 84.20 mills and
for 1916 it is 101.20 mills, an increase
of 17 mills. The rate in Princeton
village is 80.80 mills, as compared to
63.58 mills last year, an increase of
17.22 mills. The rate for school pur
poses in Milaca is 48.4 mills and for
state, county and village purposes
52.8 mills. In Princeton village the
rate for schools is 34.-7 mills, and for
all other purposes 46.1 mills.
To ascertain the total rate of tax
ation in any school district add the
state, county and township or village
rates to the school district rate, and
the total will be the rate of taxation
in the district. If a special tax has
been levied that rate must be added
also. In district No. 1 (Princeton
village) the state rate is 3.7, county
.9, village 32.5, school 34.7total80.8.

\A Sample Criticism.'
New York, Dec. 23.George W.
Perkins issued a statement yesterday
in which he declared President Wil
son's note of Wednesday breathed hy
pocrisy and Secretary Lansing's state
ment breathed incompetency.
The statement follows:
"Any school boy ought to have
enough intelligence and patriotism to
AA^sdmi,
VOLUME IXL NO. 1
blush with shame at their action.
"The President's letter was weak
and pointless and offered a gratutious
insult to the Allies when he said 'each
side desires to make the rights and
privileges of weak people and smaller
states secure.'
"The letter bears every indication
of having been written for the sole
purpose of butting into the situation.
No wonder London prevented the pub
lication of the note on its receipt.
"When I read the statement Secre
tary Lansing issued yesterday I could
scarcely believe my eyes. It bears all
earmarks of a man who is rattled and
incompetent. Within six or eight
hours he practically took back his
first statement by issuing a second
one.
"Imagine our secretary of state say
ing to the entire civilized world that
he did not realize the meaning of the
words he had used in an important
pronounciamento until the meaning
was pointed out to him by others.
"Mr. Wilson's note breathes hypoc
risy. Mr. Lansing's statements
breathe incompetency. Imagine the
United States of America standing be
fore the world at this great hour of
peril and crisis represented by two
such men. Surely the cup of humilia
tion is full to overflowing."
George R. Bates.
George R. Bates, a respected resi
dent of this village, and a veteran of
the Civil war, answered the final sum
mons last Friday.
Funeral services were conducted
from the family residence Sunday af
ternoon by Rev. S. Johnson of the
Congregational church. Six members
of Co. G. acted as pall bearers. In
terment was in Oak Knoll cemetery.
Geo. R. Bates was born in Quebec,
Canada, February 12, 1840. He came
to the United States when a young
man, and enlisted in Co. I of the First
Wisconsin, at the first call for volun
teers for the Civil war. He served his
adopted country well, and received an
honorable discharge on July 9, 1863,
because of disabilities. On December
2, 1864, deceased, having fully recov
ered from battle wounds, re-enlisted
and served until hostilities ceased.
Mr. Bates was united in marriage to
Miss Martha Howard on October 1,
1867, and came to Minnesota with his
"wife about 35 years ago, locating on
a farm in Spencer Brook, Isanti coun
ty. They resided in Spencer Brook
eight years, and then removed to
Princeton, which place has since been
their home.
Besides the widow deceased is sur
vived by three sons, Jackson, Burdette
and Henry.
George R. Bates was a companion
able gentleman, a good citizen, and as
husband and father was all that could
be desired. His war record was a
splendid one. He volunteerd his ser
vices at the outset of hostilities, and
after receiving an honorable discharge
re-enlisted and served his country
with honor and credit until the close
of the war.
The widow and children take- this
means to express their heartfelt
thanks to all who tendered sympathy
and aid to them in their hour of sor
row. They are truly appreciative.
Mrs. Fannie Clough.
Mrs. Fannie Clough, a former be
loved resident of Spencer Brook, suc
cumbed to cerebral hemorrhage at the
home of her daughter, Mrs. W. .J. Al
berts, in Oshkosh, Wis., Christmas
day. Mrs. Clough went to Oshkosh
Saturday for the holidays, and was
taken ill Christmas day, passing over
the great divide at 9 p. m.
The remains arrived in Minneapolis
yesterday, and the funeral services
are being conducted at the family
residence in that city, 609 Eighth ave
nue S. E., today.
Deceased, whose maiden name was
Fannie Shearston, was born in Weeds
port, N. Y., October 1, 1856, and came
to Minnesota when a girl. She was
united in marriage to Gilbert Clough
in 1873. Mr. Clough, who answered
the final summons 29 years ago, was
extensively engaged in the lumber
business, being associated with D. M.
Clough, former governor, in the well
known firm of Clough Bros. Mrs.
Clough had resided in Minneapolis
since the death of her husband.
Three sons and the daughter sur
vive her. The sons are Charles F.,
druggist in St. Paul, Rowland of
Washington state, and Gilbert of
Spencer Brook. Three brothers and
two sisters also survive, viz: Chas.
Shearston and Ernest and George
Patten, Mrs. Clarence Morton and
Mrs. David Berry.
Mrs. Clough was a faithful member
of the Methodist church, ever active
in the service of the Master. Her life
was lived well, and she displayed
qualities of goodness that win lasting
esteem.
