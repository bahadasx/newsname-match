they believed the bandit had
changed his oolicv toward
foreigners, heeding the ap
peal they sent him urging
him to cease killing foreign
ers and protect foreign prop
erty; also give guarantees to
the non-combatants, as the
world is watching him. It is
said Villa would make Tor

DOUGLAS, Dec. 28.
Threatened with death unless
he and his wife left Douglas
immediately and promised
definitely before going that
they would not appear
against C. C. "Kid" Lee, the
"King of the Tenderloin," ar
rested on a federal charge of
opium smuggling and a coun
ty charge of bootlegging, Sol
omon Davis told the police
Sunday night that he intend
ed to "stand pat" and make
the would-be intimidators
make good. If other threats
of a similar nature are made
it is possible that Davis will
swear out warrants for the
arrest of the men making
them and have them put un
der bond to keep the peace.
Davis and his wife were ar
rested last Wednesday night
in a raid on Kid Lee's "Quo
Vadis" club in the tenderloin
district. Opium was found in
their possession and they
were charged with having
smuggled it.

(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.
Louis Cabrera, chairman of
the Mexican commission, ar
rived today bearing Carran-
za's answer to the American
demand that he ratify or re
pudiate the protocol signed
at Atlantic Citv. Cabrera ar
ranged to deliver the answer
to Lane. The nature of the
reply was not revealed, but
it is generally believed to in
clude another suggestion for
a modification with an insist-
nece that the United States
withdraw the Perishing ex
pedition unconditionally.
The Mexican note deliver
ed to Secretary Lane today
covers eignr lypewuucu
oases. It will not be pub
lished until communicated to
the other American commis
sioners.
WILSON'S BIRTHDAY
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.
President Wilson is 60
years old today and has re
ceived many congratulatory
messages. There was no spe
cial celebration.
IS IGNORED Bf DAVIS
the negroes who were taken
with him have assumed what
ever blame there was, and he
has gone scott free. This time
it was different.
Davis and the officers had a long
talk. He made it very evident that he
and his wife had no desire to be "fall
guys" for Lee. His tentative offer to
turn state's evidence was accepted and
when he and the woman were taken
before U. S. Commissioner H. C. Beum
ler for arraignment, each made affi
davit that the opium in their posses
sion had been purchased from Lee.
Lee's arrest followed. He was held
under bond of $1500 for appearance at
his preliminary hearing. He gave bond
but was immediately re-arrested by
county officers on a charge of bootleg
ging and his bond on that charge fixed
at $1000. He was unable to give that
amount and remained in jail. Saturday
night, one of his sureties withdrew
from the federal bond, only one, R. O.
Fitch, remaining on it Lee was there
fore doubly in jail. And there he re
mained over Christmas, despite the ef
forts of his friends to find bondsmen.
One rearon, perhaps, no one else
could be found was that it was gen
erally understood Lee would be prompt
ly re-anestcd on another charge even
though he furnished both bonds. It
was stated at the city hall a few days
ago that there were several charges of
various kinds standing against him, in
any one of which the officers feel sure
they have iron-clad evidence which
cannot be evaded.

AND MEN
(By the Associated Press.)
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.
The railway managers and
brotherhood presidents' con
ference terminated abruptly
this afternoon after two hours
without any announcement
of any future meeting. It was
learned that the railroads
suggested that the Adamson
law, if upheld, be applied as
was the recent switchmens'
award, giving nine hours' pay
for eight hours' work. The
brotherhoods declined to ac
cept such a basis, insisting
that the Adamson law provid
ed ten hours' pay for eight
hours', work. The brother
AMERICAN SOLDIERS
ARE KEPT WARM
(By Associated Press.)
EL PASO, Dec. 28. Un
like the American soldiers of
the Revolutionary war, who
shivered and froze at Valley
Forge, the soldiers encamped
along the Mexican border
have warm sibley tents heat
ed by a small sheet iron stove
wherein the wood crackles
cheerily.
The mess houses, which
during the warm weather
were mere sheds screened in
from flies, now are walled
with tarred roofing paper.
Officers' tents and other
buildings are boarded up.
In the regular camps, can
vas has been displaced by
wooden huts, but it is felt the
uncertain stay of the guards
does not warrant improve
ments of such permanence.
Winter clothing was issued
before the cold weather set
in, so there has been no suf
fering on that score except
.t p
in tne case or a envision on
a practice march which began
in warm weather and ended
in a cold wave.
The winter along the bor
der differs in severity accord
ing to the altitude. At El
Paso which is about 4000 feet
above sea level, the middle
part of the day is comfortab
ly warm, so that the men or
dinarily go without overcoats
and sometimes without jack
ets or sweaters. The sun is
bright and the air crystal.
But as the sun wanes, the ef
fect is felt sharply.
At night the glass drops to
freezing or below. The wind
and dust storms that mark
the spring and summer are
rare at this season.

The Official text of Ger

(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.
Uermany will not permit
her peace negotiations to be
blocked by the allies' refusal
to enter a conference without
a previous knowledge of the
terms, was made known here
today. The central powers
are represented as willing to
permit a contiaentiai ex
change of broad tentative
terms through the president
if necessary. It is broadly in
timated that Germany either
communicated this position
or would do so soon.
Germany it is said would be
looking for the United States
to make every effort to ar
range a peace conference,
and consequently would be
ready to consider any of the
president's suggestions.

PHYSICAL TRAINING A GREAT FACTOR

NEW YORK, Dec. 28. In
an interesting aaaress on
"The Making and Remaking
of a Fighting Man," deliver
ed at the annual meeting of
the National College Athletic
Association here today, R.
Tait McKenzie, professor of
physical education of the
University of Pennsylvania
and late Major R.A.M.C.,
England, said, in part:
You do not need to watch
to tell when it is 9 o'clock at
the headquarters gymnasium
at Aldershot. For 15 minutes
or more groups of men in
black trousers and jerseys, or
officers in tennis kit, have
been -accumulating, and at 9
o'clock precisely a shrill whis
tle petrifies them in the po
sition of Attention.. There
is a dead silence and the
sharp command 'Fall In' is
succeeded by a scramble, out
of which emerge 20 classes
of officers and men, each in
proportion to about 4 to 1,
neatly arranged on the floor,
each with a staff instructor
in charge. At the command
Staff Fall In' each instructor
doubles to where the ser
geant major stands, and there
they stand at attention to re
ceive the day's orders. These
given, they make a right turn,

off to their respective classes.!

BERLIN, Dec. 28. The
Russo-Rumanian defeat by
Teutons was complete. Yes
terday the Teutons took three
thousand prisoners.
III THE MUG OF FIGHTING MEN
Another silence, and the
sharp command 'Carry on' is
followed by a babel of orders
as the various groups march
out of the four doors to se
lected places in the twenty
acre grounds that surrounded
the gymnasium. For the next
hour and a half each class is
put through the table of exer
cises for the day; each exer
cise detailed, repeated and
corrected until officer and
men have the proper speed
and accuracy for which they
strive.
"At 10:30 the whistle
breaks the classes up into
groups for rest. After 15 min
utes the same proceeding is
gone through again, but this
time the men are paired off;
No. 1 teaching the last hour's
work to No. 2 and back again
