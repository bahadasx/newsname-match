GREAT-UKES-TO-OULF PROJECT
VISITING MORGAN CITY
Well-Known Waterways Booster, of St. Louis, Expresses
Amazement at Morpn City's Water Facilities.
Predict Barge Line From St. Louis.
With Castell Party on Delphine
Mr. W. K. Kavanaugh of St.
Louis, one of the leading business
men of that place, but better known
for the interest he has taken in deep
water projects, arrived in Morgan
City last night with the Castell party
of New Orleans on the yacht Del
phine. The arrival of Mr. Kavan
augh was totally unexpected and
had it not been for the fact that a
Review reporter recognized him, he
would have probably gotten out as
quietly as he arrived.
The visit of Mr. Kavanaugh at
this time shows that the * eyes of
really big men are on Morgan City,
and that outside capital is deeply in
terested in the future of this city
and the surrounding country.
Mr. Kavanaugh has been president
of the Great Lakes'to the Gulf deep
waterway project since it was
launched. He personally conducted
President's Roosevelt and Taft on
their trips of inspection down the
Mississippi River.
Asked his opinion concerning the
water facilities surrounding Morgan
City, Mr. Kavanaugh expressed him
self as being perfectly amazed at the
advantages we have, saying that,
"He could see no reason why there
sHbuld not be a barge line from St.
Louis down this far. He added that
he expected to see dinky streams
with a couple of feet of water, but
that the trip after the Delphine left
Plaquemine was a revelation to
him."

aid for maintaining the ship channel

Miss Leah Norman entertained a
large number of her friends with a
party at her home on Tuesday even--j
inê- The preparations for the event '
were complete and every one who at

one of the most delightful of the)

ette Greenwood, Esther Lynch, Amy
Young, Vivian Cropper, Mary
Beard Freida Bass and Fannie Gold-I
man. Messrs Lyman Reed, John'

Moncrief, Arthur Golden, Raymond
Jaret, Norman Bauar, Daniel Nor
man and Chas. Kahn.
Delicious refreshments were »er- (
ved in a charming manner.
man Whit P. Martin, Mr. Kavanaugh
stated emphatically that this aid
should be given by the government.
Deviating from the subject of
water facilities for a moment Mr.
Kavanaugh asked if there were a
more beautiful home in Morgan City
than that of Wm. Cotten Jr., saying
that this was a splendid home. This
is quite a compliment, as Mr. Kavan
augh maintains one of the finest
homes in St. Louis, and until ten
days ago owned "Kennets Castle"
one of the show places on the Miss
issippi river about forty miles below
St. Louis. He sold the place ten days
ago to a millionaire oil man from
Oklahoma.
Mr. Kavanaugh said that he was
going out with Mr. Castell today to
look over the latters reclamation pro
ject, and that they would go out as
far as the Gulf and would return to
Morgan City tonight.
Mr. Kavanaugh said that this was
his first trip to Morgan City but em
phatically stated that it would not be
the last.
Mr. Kavapaugh will go to New
Orleans for New Year's to take din
ner with his old friends Mr. and
Mrs. Phillip Werlein.
Mr. Kavanaugh was accompanied
by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Cocke, also
of St. Louis. Mrs. Cocke said that
St. Louis was in the grip of a severe
storm when the party left on Mon
day. They made the trip to New
Orleans on the Illinois Central's new
train the Panama Limited which
Mrs. Cocke characterized as one of
the country's finest.

We Hope Fire Won't Come
to your home during the com
ing year, hut there is a possi
bility that it may, and if it
does you should be prepared
for the consequences. It
seems to us s«i foolish when a
man says he doesn't need tire
insurance, that he has never
had a tire and doesn't expect
to have one. When a tire
starts yon can never tell
where it will end. Be pre
pared in any event by taking
out a fire insurance policy.
