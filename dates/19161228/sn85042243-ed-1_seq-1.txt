Latest Announcement
LEGISLATURE MAY FORM
CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS
Nothing in Constitution or Stat
utes To Prevent Such Action
'Tis Said
LATEST SLATE.
Howard R. Wood of Deering,
ton of F. B. Wood, president of
the League Exchange and vice
president of the Non-partisan
league, for speaker of th« house.
A constitutional convention,
composed1 by the legislature of its
own members aa a committee of
the whole.
William Lemke for supreme
court reporter.
A. E. Bowen for clerk of the
house.
The above are some of the ante
assembly developments of the day.
A. E. Bowmanof Kulm is conceded
the support of the Equity for the
speakership, hut $he league, according
to prominent itate leaders, .will be
solid for Wtoodl1 Wood received the
endorsement of the Ward county dele­
gation some time ago, and this start­
ed his'campaign rolling. It has been
gathering momentum ever since, and
for several weeks he has been rec­
ognized generally in league circles as
the man for the place. Wood is- a
young man, with lots of pep, ana
friends predict that he will make a
corking good presiding officer for the
house. There may be a merry little
contest betweqa Bowman and Wo6d
for the speakership, but it is not gen­
erally regarded .probable.
Convention Certain.
One of the certainties of the ses­
sion is a constitutional convention.
"There is nothing to -prevent the leg­
islature itself constituting this con­
vention," said a league chieftain this
morning. "It would save a great deal
of time and probably accomplish the
same results as a convention compos­
ed of specially elected delegates."
North 'Dakota attempted a consti­
tutional convention in 1896, when Sec­
retary of State Dahl submitted the
question to the people, after being
mandamused by J. P. Weineman. The
people voted no in large quantities,
and there was no convention.
The method, time and place of
holding a constitutional convention
are entirely in the hands of the leg­
islature. It is claimed the legislators
may themselves constitute delegates
to the "Con Con" they may appoint
delegates of their own choosing, or
they may call a special election, at
which the people will have an oppor­
tunity to name delegates.
Lemke Gets Good Berth.
The .berth of supreme court report­
er is one of some ameliorations, and
that William Lemke, chairman of the
Republican state central committee,
would receive some such reward for
his labors has been a foregone con­
clusion. Justice-elect James G. Rob­
inson announces today that Mr. Lem­
ke has it, and that he will succeed
F. W. Ames of Mayville in this ca­
pacity January 1.
Bowen Gets Clerkship.
.It has been equally certain that
A. E. Bowen, one of the league's
most efficient organizers, would have
some recognition for his pains. It
was more or less definitely announc­
ed this morning that that recognition
will take the form of the (clerkship of
the house, confirming the Tribune's
report of several days ago.
Caucus Tomorrow.
Up to noon today only a handful
nf .legislators had reached the city.
The league, however, is here in force,
with Townley, Bowen. McKaig,
Coates, Hagan, .Wood and other bat­
tle chiefs in the fore.
GERMANY OFFERS
TERNS FOR PEACE
REPORTS DECLARE
(By raited Press.)
Berlin. Dec. 28.—The opinion pre­
vailing in Berlin is that Germany's
answer to President Wilson's note
warmly appreciates the President's
intention and adds a practical sug­
gestion for peace, the Press Bureau
semi-officially announced today.
The statement says that all Central
Powers were handed by United States
diplomats a copy of the note at the
same. time. The statement says that
nothing secret is connected with the
message. This disposes of a report
carried by irresponsible news agen­
cies mat another confltfential note ts
being sent to Ambassador Gerard with
Germany's answer.

catch "Pancho" Villa and the Mexi­
can bandit is still at large. He has
just captured the Mexican city Tor
reon.
The war department has not yet Is­
sued an official report on the cost of
trying to catch the $49,000,000 bandit.

school kiddies gathered at the ruins
of their Fargo high school today. The
school was destroyed «by fire last
night. Without visible signs of sad­
ness, the kiddies looked for their
books, destroyed in the fire. By the
fire, the vacation will, perhaps, be
extended a couple of weeks. The fire
started by 127 night pupils accidently
causing an explosion while working
in the chemical laboratory. The loss
is $75,000 of which ninety per cent
was covered by insurance. The pupils
and eight teachers escaped safely.

Washington, Dec. 28.—Over $60,
000,000 was made in Wall street this
month by those having advance in­
formation on President Wilson's
peace note, according to a telegram
received today by Representative
Wood, Indiana, from Lawson. Wood
has been investigating alleged leak­
ing of government diplomatic infor­
mation.
Tip From Lawson..
The telegram said:
"I have just received New York -pa­
pers in which you are being quoted
as not being able to And me .in Bos­
ton. I am surprised. In my office, I
have a letter addressed merely 'Tho­
mas W. Lawson,' without another
word on the envelope, and mailed
from a little interior village in China.
The letter reached me in record fast
time without apparent trouble. If
you would like to communicate with
me, please just toss an envelope out
of the window of the Congressional
building, addressed either just Thom­
as W. Lawson, without the name of
any city on it, or just "T. W. L.. Eos
ton," and you will get me in a short
time. Take a tip from one who play­
ed the international publicity game
before you were old enough to tell
the difference between a stock mar­
ket and a congressional hall."

Four Brotherhoods and Rail
Heads in Conference Over
Adamson Eight Hour Act
JOINT BOARD PROPOSED
TO DECIDE OPERATION
(Associated Press.)
New York, Dec. 28.—The 'National
Conference Committee of Railroad
iManagers atyi representatives of four
brotherhoods of employes resumed
here today to determine the applica­
tion of the Adamson law, in the event
it is held constitutional by the Unit­
ed States supreme court.
Under an agreement between At­
torney General Gregory and the rail­
road attorneys, the effectiveness of
the Adamson law has been susppend
ed pending the outcome of the test
suit. Therefore, on January 1, the
employes will continue their work
without any immediate benefit from
the law, which was to have gone in
effect on that date.
The railroads, it is understood, will
not withdraw the suit or permit any­
thing to halt the decision of the
court. It was stated a,'so that the
railroad managers would decline to
enter into any alliance with the un­
ions in return for their support in
their effort to defeat President Wil­
son's proposed policy of compulsion
of investigating labor disputes. The
railroads also will decline, it was
stated, to co-operatc in any way to
have the Adamson law repealed. A
possible outcome of today's confer­
ence was the appointment of a joint
board to determine the operation of
the law if its constitutionality is es­
tablished.

London, Dec. 28.—Dispatch of the
Allies' reply to President Wilson's
peace note will be made immediately,
it became known by the United Press
today. The phraseology of all the En­
tente allies' notes will be similar.
They will all reject the peace note
drawn upon German plans.
Vigorous Statement.
A vigorous statement will make
clear the aims of the Entente allies
in the present war. These, the state­
ment will say, are the right to oppose
militarism and the policy of might
makes right. The note, other than
this statement of the war's aims, will
not state the terms upon which the
Entente allies are willing to make
peace. The note will further reject
plans for a peace conference, suggest­
ed by Germany. After the dispatch
of this joint note, it is thought that
England will send another supple­
mental note.
TEXT RECEIVED.
(Associated Presa)
Washington, Dec. 28^THrTincial
text of Germany's reply to President
Wilson's note was received here early
today. So far as was known, it was
unaccompanied by any other com­
munication, and was said to b# sub­
stantially the same as the unofficial
text received Tuesday from Berlin.
The official text, which differs in
phraseology from the unofficial, fol­
lows:
"The imperial government has ac­
cepted and considered in the friend­
ly spirit which is apparent in the
communication of the president's, the
noble initiative of the president look­
ing to creation of basis for the foun­
dation of lasting peace.
"The president discloses the aim
which lies next to his heart and
leaves the choice of way open.
"A direct exchange of viewa ap­
pears to the imperial government as
the most suitable for arriving at the
desired results."
MAKES GOOD IMPRESSION.
(Associated Press.)
Berlin, Dec. 27.—Germany's answer
to President Wilson and the prompt­
ness in which it was made has caused
a good impression generally in the
press. Only anti-American newspa­
pers show a tendency to dissent and
express the view that interference of
any kind by America would be intol­
erable. The papers find a satisfaction
in the proposal that delegates of bel­
ligerents meet on neutral territory,
which is interpreted as fairly exclud­
ing participation of the neutrals in
the conference.

ing a direct attack on the German an­
swer, assumes that no German dele­
gates will be found_willing to take a

The most recent attack scored
its greatest success in the region
of Rimnik-Sarat, on the railway ,'

sians from the new line they had
taken up after the failure of a

corner of the province. Forty-five
heights east of Matchin were tak­
en. Military correspondents re­
port that the Teutonic guns on
the Dobrudja side at thiB point
are able to reach Braiia, which
