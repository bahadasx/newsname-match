The president and secretary of the
Commercial club took into account
that it was a stormy day and that
probably many of the business men
would lunch down town that it seem
ed a good opportunity to get them to
gether for an informal meeting and
dinner, so a call was sent out to meet
at the Rudolf. Thirty-nine responded
to the summons and graced the dining
room of Mine Host Varco with their
presence. After a fine and substantial
feed Secretary Moe called upon one or
two from each of the several tables
for a short talk. Several matters of
importance were discussed by the var
ious speakers, and a general good feel
ing pervaded the atmosphere. Optim
ism was present a plenty. At the
conclusion of the speeches the secre
tary further stated that there were
three large conventions scheduled for
Valley City in the spring and early
summer. These gatherings must be
taken care of by the citizens of the
city, and the membership of the Com
mercial club should take an active and
large part. Also that the membership
of the club must soon be recruited to
the 200-mark.
Another informal meeting of the
club members will follow soon, and
then another and another. Let the
good work go on.

James Ready to Give Aid
in'Securing Farm Loans
Considerable interest has been
shown by farmers of the county in the
matter of borrowing money through a
federal farm loan association. There
is«no reason why the farmers of Bar
nes county should not make use of
money .at a moderate rate of interest
if they will form an association in
compliance with the regulations as out
lined by the federal farm loan act.
The law allows any farmer or any
one about to become a farmer, and
who will join a federal farm loan asso
ciation, to borrow money up to one
half of the appraised value of the land
and one-fifth of the value of the per
manent improvements, on' first mort
gage.
There are several advantages to be
gained bv borrowing money through
this means. One is that th^ interest
rates will be moderate. This rate can
not exceed six per cent and mav be
less. Another is that there will be
no commission to nay at time of bor
rowing, as is xisually the case,.
Then too, one can borrow on the
amortization plan. That is, he Days a
small Ter cent of the principal each
vear along with the interest. Again,
he can make a long time loan uo to
40 vears, which loan can be paid as
fast as he desires after five years.
In order to get these benefits, far
mers must form an association, which
must consist of at least ten members,
and at least $20,000 must be asked for
by such association. While ten far
mers may form an association, it will
be to their advantage to get a lareer
group together. After an association
is organized, as many as care to may
join. Thev must bd voted in bv the
men already belonging to the associa
tion.
The money is not yet available. b»t
the preliminary organizations should
be organized soon.
Those interested in this matter
should eet In touch with their county
agent, who is supposed to give assist
ance in the way of Information and
in the matter of forming associations.

REITERATES CLAIM THAT
WINTER WILL BE "OPEN"
"No, I will not recede one jot from
my original contention," asserted Dr.
Eeede of the Standing Rock reserva

diction that North Dakota would en
joy an "open winter." "We have had
our cold snap," said the missionary,
"and from now on we are going to
jhave nice weather. I have read the
signs, and the signs never lie. I pre
dicted last winter that the past sea
son would be a poor one for wheat,
but excellent for flax, corn and forage
crops. On the strength of this pre
diction Dr. Stackhouse broke a quar
ter and sowed it to flax, and he in
tends to make me a nice present from
the proceeds. I cannot tell until
March what the next season will be,
but I will know then."
