England and France Have f greed
Upon Terms of 1 heir Reply
MAY BE SENT THIS WEEK
Official London Apparently Waiting
for Advance Suggestions
From Germany.
.London, Deo. 28. England and
France have fully agreed upon the
terms of the reply to be made to the
peace proposals of the Teutonic al
lies, the Associated Press learned at
the foreign office yesterday. It is
hoped at London that the answer may
be dispatched by the end of this
week, but other nations erf the en
tente, although agreed In principle,
may require verbal alterations which
would necessitate further delay. It is
expected that once this reply has
been forwarded, the response to Presi
dent Wilson's note will follow very
soon.
Russia's reply to the German peace
proposals was telegraphed Monday to
the French government, says a Keuter
dispatch from Petrograd received at
London. It adds that the Swiss min
ister has handed to the Russian for
eign minister the note of the Swiss
government supporting President
Wilson's note.
It la believed In official circles at
London that there does not exist any
possibility of assembling a peace
conference, as proposed in the Ger
man reply to President Wilson's note,
unless Germany is willing to make
suggestions In advance regarding her
Ideas of the terms of peace.
.. ..ANCIENT INCA CAPITAL
-1 l
Interesting Picture Presented To
Mlu Carpenter's School.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Bingham
has presented to the Maude E. Car
penter school a fine picture of "The
Ruins of an Ancient Inca Capital,
Machu. Ricchu." This wonderful city,
which was built by the Incas probab
ly 2000 years ago, was discovered in
1911 by Professor Hiram Bingham, of
Yale University, and uncovered and
excavated under his direction in 1912,
under the auspices of the National
Geographic society and Vale Univer
sity, and may prove to be the most
Important group of ruins discovered
in South America since the conquest
of Peru.
This city Is situated on a narrow,
precipitous ridge, two thousand feet
above the river and seven thousand
feet above the sea, In the grand can
yon of the Urubamba, one of the most
inaccessible parts of the Andes, sixty
miles north of Cuzco, Peru. It con
tains about two hundred edifices built
of white granite, and including
palaces, temples, shrines, boths, foun
tains, and many stairways. The city
does not appear to 'have been known
to the Spaniards.

NOT YET TIME TO TALK PEACE
War Must Continue Until Russia is
Complete Victor Over Her
Enemies.
London, Dec. 2S. A dispatch from
Petrograd, by way of the British ad
miralty wireless, says that In tin or
der issued to all the units of the Rus
sian army, dated the 25th, Emperor
iNicholas, In a brief review showing
how the inequalities in the technical
resources for warfare as between the
allies and the central powers are be
ing gradually removed, with the re
sult that' the enemy strength is ap
parently waning, while that of Russia
and her allies is continually growing,
says:
"Germany is feeling that her com
plete defeat is near, and near also Is
the hour of retribution for all her
wrongdoings and violations of the
moral law. As in the time of her
strength she declared war, so now
feeling her weakness she suddenly
offers to enter upon peace negotia
tions, desiring to complete such nego
tiations before her military talent is
exhausted. At the same time she is
creating a false impression about the
strength of her army by utilizing her
temporary success over, the Rumani
ans, who lack experience in the con
duct of modern warfare."
Arguing that the allies are entitled
to choose a favorable hour for peace
negotiations, just as Germany chose
a favorable hour for declaring war,
the order says: "This time has not
yet arrived. The enemy has not been
driven out of the provinces he has
occupied. Russia's attainment of the
tasks created by the war regarding
Constantinople and the Dardanelles
as well as the creation of a free Po
land from all three of her now Incom
plete tribal districts has not yet
been guaranteed.
"To conclude peace at this moment
would mean failure to utilize the
fruits of the untold trials of the heroic
Russian troops and fleet. These trials
and the still more sacred memory of
those noble sons of Russia who have
fallen on the battlefield do not permit
of thought of peace until final victory
over our enemies. Who dares to
think that he who brought about war
shall have it in his power to conclude
the war at any time ho likes?"
In conclusion, the emperor, ex
pressing confidence tin t no Russian
soldier would desire peace until the
enemy had been expelled from Rus
sian soil and had given guarantees to
prevent a possible repetition of a
treacherous attack, says: "Let us
be firm in the certainty of our victory,
and the All Highest will bless our
standards and will cover them afresh
with glory and give us peace worthy
of your heroic deeds, my glorious
eratlons will bless your memory,
which will be sacred to them."

ADMIRAL DEWEY IS 79.
Congratulated by Secretary
Daniels
and Bureau Chiefs.
Washington, Dec. 20. Secretary
Daniels and his bureau chiefs today
went In a body to the General Board
Rooms In. order to congratulate the
Admiral of the Navy, George Dewey,
on his seventy-ninth birthday.
I During the general felicitations Sec
retary Daniels read to Admiral Dewey
j an extrac t from the log of an old ship
mate ui me .vuiuiiai. liua oaipniuia
i was First Assistant Engineer Henry
Brown, who was with the old Colora
do Just after the civil war, at the
time when Admiral Dewey was First
Lieutenant on that warship. Several
months ago Dr. S. W. Gibson. Chief
Clerk of the Bureau of Medicine and
Surgery, was at Nantucket, where En
gineer Brown now lives, and saw the
entry in the engineer's diary' which
the Secretary read today to Admiral
Dewey.
Commenting on this, Mr. Daniels
said It showed the Interest in the wel
fare of the men of the navy displayed
by Admiral Dewey "when he was a
young officer in the nevy. which had
ever been characteristic of the man
none the less in his green old age,
with successes and honors heaped up
on him by his own country and by the
whole world."
The entry in Engineer Brown's
diary was dated Dec. 26, 1866, having
reference to the Christmas Day pre
ceding, and is as follows:
Doc. 26. 1916.
No Christmas, perhaps, passed off
pleasanter ou a man of war than this
one. Mr. Dewey. First Lieutenant, as
well as Captain' in absence of Captain
Wynian, succeeded in making all on .
board happy and contented. j
The day before he gave permission j
to all the caterers of the messes to go
on shore so that they might preimre
their Christmas dinners, and also
that the galley could be used for cook
ing all the night, so as not to interfere
with the officers' meals. Each man
endeavored to outvie his neighbor In
the good things appropriate for the
day. I
The First Lieutenant made each I
man a present of a bottle of wine or
in that proportion from the money
obtained from the Slush Fund. At an
early hour all the men were actively
arranging the tables and dressing the
ship between decks with flags, pic
tures and greens. j
The tables extended from the cabin
to the forward gun deck, and were
capable of just holding the ship's com
pany. At noon all was ready, and the
700 men commenced eating, no
doubt, one of the most happy meals
on shipboard. The whole affair
showed excellent taste. I
All the officers paid visits to differ
ent messes and were cheered with a
welcome known only to the sailor.
The ship was, in a manner given up
to the crew so that after their dinner,
which lasted two hours, all com
menced smoking. Throughout the
I whole day all was perfect order, with
the exception of here and there a loud
J voice from one who had probably tak-
Admiral Dewey showed evident
pleasure at having tho old days re
called, and was very happy in express
ing his appreciation.
Urand Canyon Rocks.
In the very bottom of the Grnnd con
yon lie the dark, Inconspicuous rocks,
mostly tough crystalline granite gneiss
and schist, the oldest iu the canyon
and among the oldest In the world. I
They were in part deposited as sands '
and muds in n sen, in part accumulated
us lava Hows and In pnrt intruded be
neath the surface as molten rock. Ail
these materials became solidified, and
later they were slowly heaved and
crumpled Into mountains, which were
lu time worn down by rain, rivers and
perhaps the waves of the r ea to n near
ly level hind surface. This 'surface
finally sank beneath the sea and be
came thf floor on which fresh sedi
ments began to accumulate. Twice at
least was this' mighty cycle repented In
the Grand canyon region.
A Polite Doubt.
A fond parent was telling Oliver Iler
ford of the really bright remark of her
three-year-old daughter.
Ilerford was much impressed.
"How old did yon say little Lena is?"
he asked.
"Only threo," answered the mother
proudly. '

solemnly, "1 have a suspicion that some
times thee children lie about their

LEAVE All EUROPE BEHIND
Present Resources of National Banks
More Than Double What They
Were 10 Years Ago.
Washington, Dec. 28. Resources of
national banks of the United States,
Controller Williams announced last
night have increased more than $4,
000,000,000 during the past two years
and now aggregate $15,520,000,000,
exceeding by about $1,000,000,000 the
total resources of the bank of Eng-1
land, the bank of France, the bank of
Russia, the German Reichsbank, the
bank of Italy, the bank of Spain, the
bank of the Netherlands, the bank of
Denmark, the Swiss national bank
and the Imperial bank of Japan com-.
bined. j
In a statement based upon returns
from the last bank call, November 17,
the controller calls attention to the
fact that the increase has been at the
rate of approximately 18 per cent a
year during the past two years, as
compared with 6 per cent a year for
the 10 year period from 1904 to 1914, J
and that the total resources are at I
present more than double what they
were 10 years ago. j
"The compilation just completed of
returns for the last bank call," the
controller's statement reads, "dis
closes a condition of strength, pro
gress and growth beyond all prece
dent. Resources of national banks
on the date of the last call are greater
than the total resources of all report-1
ing state DanKs, savings banks, pri
vate bunks and loan and trust com
panies throughout the United States
at the time of the inaugurated of the
federal reserve system about two
years ago.
"It is also noteworthy that the re
sources of our national banks at this
tlmo exceed by $321,000,000 the total
resources of all the reporting bank-.'
ing institutions in the United States,
including state banks, savings banks
and loan and trust companies and na
tional banks as well, as late as the
year 1904." j
The greatest percentage of in-.'
crease, the controller states, during
the two-year period in which the fed
eral reservo system has been In oper
ation, was in the western states.
Geographically, the increase was as
follows: New England. 22 per cent;
eastern states, 3!) per cent; southern
states, 32 per cent; middle western
states, 31 per cent; western states, 50
per cent: Pacific states, 33 per cent. I
"In this period" the statement
says, "the New England and east
ern states Increased a total of $2,005,
000,000 while the South and West, In
cluding the far West, increased $2,-

CHEMICAL PLANT
AT STAMFORD If!
ALLEGED EXPOSE
Boston Paper After Bennington
County Concern
COMPANY HAS PI-ORGANIZED
Newspaper Story Hints at Two Stock
Selling Operations With Not
Many Assets In Sight.
The plant of the Union Cement and
Chemical company at Stamford,
, which was sold by Bennington coun
ty owners some two years ago to in
terests without Vermont, is tho basis
of a sensational story which appeared
in the Boston American .of Tuesday,
j "The plant, which is not now run
ning and which is in charge of the
foreman, Is said to have been the
basis of a stock deal when the Union
Cement company was formed and Is
now being offered as the basis of
another stock deal under the corpor
ate name of the Woods Product com
pany. It is asserted that the Union
Chemical company was a half mil
lion dollar afiair and that Its stock
Is now claimed to be worthless, and
that the new Wood Products com
pany, launched six weeks ago, is an
other half million dollar affair.
Speaking of its allegal revela
tions, the Boston American says
that they "concern the formation of
two companies to operate the same
plant for the manufacture of chem
icals from wood. When one com
pany, capitalized ten months ago for
$500,000, had ceased to operate the
plant, which Is now mortgaged, an
other was formed to operate the
same plant, and a selling campaign
Is now under way to dispose of an
other half million in stock.
Connecting the alleged stock
transactions with the firm of 'James
J. Benelisha of Boston, the Ameri
can goes on to describe the ven
tures as follows:
"At Stamford, Vt., almost within
sight of the famous Mohawk Trail,
which winds down the side of one of
the Berkshire hills, is located a plant
which until early this year was con
ducted by Stamford residents for the
manufacture of charcoal, chemicals
and wood alcohol from wood.
"Jt is this plant a cluster of
small wooden buildings which Is
the basis for the promotion of two
companies tho Union Cement and
Chemical company, being first or
ganized and being floated for a half
million of dollars, and the Wood
Products company, making its ,ap
pearance six weeks ago with the
same capitalization.
"Officials of Cotter and company,
a brokerage firm formed eight weeks
ago at 99 State street, and who are
selling the stock in the Wood Pro
ducts' company, today declared that
it was tho plant at Stamford, Vt.,
to which they refer In their circu
lar setting forth the tremendous
profits to accrue to investors in this
company. j
"Finillar predictions and promi
ses were set forth in circulars and
advertisomenits . emanating from
James J. Benelisha and company, ;
when the Union Cement and Cliemi-:
cal company was floated six months !
before to provide the funds to take
over and operate the same plant in
the Berkshire hills. j
"Union cement stock was sold very
freely to hundreds of people In Bos
ton and New England. Wood Pro
ducts company stock is now being'
sold. In many cases efforts are be-:
ing made to sell the latter stock
to owners of Union Cement. J
"Both companies were organized
in Portland, Me., and incorporated
under tho laws of Maine. The cap-,
ital stock of Union Cement Is $500,000
of which $400,000 is common and $100, 1
000 preferred. j
"No definite itemized financial
statement could be obtained from
those who had sold Union Ceraonc
stating just what assets existed up
on which this stock was issued.
The value of this plant, which is
not now running, could not bo ascer
tained, but there is a mortgage of $40, i
000 on record against it.
"No record of any other assets
could be found."

rison I. Norton, at 4 o'clock Wednes
day afternoon was married to Lieut.
Francis Augustus Englehart of tho
United States coast artillery, Rev.
Thornton F. Turner, the rector, of
ficiating. Simple but effective decorations of
Christmas green and Easter lilies
and the subdued light of candles in
the approaching dusk of the late at-'
ternoon added an element of solemni
ty to the impressive service. Young
spruces had been placed at the base
of each pillar, the double row of lofty
candlesticks extending the entire
length of the church had been roped
with ground pine and a bank of
Easter lilies surmounted the marble
altar. The contrast of white and
green, nature's own at the Christ
mas Bcason, together with the beauti
ful church interior combined to com
plete an appropriate setting for the
ceremony.
The matron of honor, Mrs. Edward
Stevens of New York, the maid of
honor, Miss Elizabeth P. Taylor of
Philadelphia and the bridesmaids.
Miss Katharine Boyer of East Orange,
N. J., Miss Mary Shaw of Old Ben
nington and Miss Helen Boyd of Phil
adelphia, entered the church from the
parish house and marched down the
berlbboned aisle to the church en
trance to meet the other members of
the bridal party.
The bride, walked with her father,
who gave her in marriage. Her
gown was of white satin cut entraine
and trimmed with rose point lace. Her
long veil of tulle fell from a wreath
of orange blossoms about her hair
and her bouquet was a shower of
bride roses and Miles of the valley.
The matron of honor, the maid of
boner, and the bridesmaids wore yel
low satin trimmed with gold lace and
velvet hats. They carried red roses
tied with bows of wide red ribbon.
Lieut. William Capthorne, the best
man, Lleuts. Alfred Balnbrldge John
son, James Crawford and Raymond E.
Lee, the ushers, who like the bride-'
groom, are instructors at the West
Point military academy, wore the full
dress uniform of the United States
army.
Preceding the service, Augustine
Daley at the organ gave a recital of
songs by American, French, Russian
and English composers. The proces
sional was the bridal chorus from
Lohengrin and the recessional the
wedding march from Mendelssohn's
Midsummer Night's Dream.
At the conclusion of the ceremony
the ushers formed the arch of swords
from under which the bride and
bridegroom and the bride's attendants
marched out of the church to await
ing automobiles.'
Immediately after the service a re
ception was held at the residence of
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison I. Norton on
Elm street, attended by about 150
relatives of the bride and groom and
immediate acquaintances of the bride
and her parents. The bridal party
and the bride's parents were assisted
in receiving by Miss Margurlte Engle
hart of Cameron, Mo., sister, of the
bridegroom. Forest green, cut flow
ers and potted poinsettias were used
in an exceptionally pretty scheme of
Interior decorations. Donnelly's or
chestra was in attendance and re
freshments were served.
Mr. Englehart is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry F. Englehart of Cameron,
Mo. He was appointed to the mili
tary academy at the conclusion of his
first college year and received his
commission with the members of the
class of 1913. He elected the
coast artillery branch of the service
and was assigned to the . military
academy as instructor In mathema
tics. . ..
Mrs. Englehart is the only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Norton. She has
passed her enflre life In the communi
ty where she has taken u prominent
