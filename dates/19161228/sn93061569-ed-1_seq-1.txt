CLAYTON TO HAVE
CHATAQUA COURSE
A committee composed of'H Rich
mond Mills, 'Prof. Chamberlain, Mrs.
Joe Gill, Mrs. M. R. Jones, Mr. Lord
and Mr. Lord and Attorney Woodward
met with a representative of the Red
path Horner Co., about a month ago
and signed a contract for a five day
Chataqua, to be held in Clayton dur
ing the coming summer.
The personel of the committee rep
resented the churches, schools, and
clubs of the town, while Mr. Wood
ward drew up the contract.
This company has contracts in Trin
idad, Amarillo, Dalhart, Springfield
and Clayton made up the required five
towns to complete the circuit.
Clayton is very fortunate in secur
ing this contract and doubly so as
they were secured without signing the
customary iron-clad contract calling
for a large guarantee. This was
i.voided through the efforts of the
committee, who impressed the repre
sentative with the fact that unless they
storned here they would lose time
and money between jumps from Trin
idad to other towns, and also that they
were figuring on securing another
company and that f a contract such as
wa3 dictated by the committee was not
signed, the Redpath company would
lose Clayton in their circuit. By
agreement secured . by " wire from
headquarters the contract was made
and Clayton is to have one of the
most entertaining courses ever given
in this country without being tied to
& Mff oniarantee. v
7-o o
The course consists of 10 numbers
and includes te "Melting Pot," Mili
tary Girls," Chicago Glee Club," "Kil-
arney Girls," besides a large orches
tra, a band concert and several of the
best lecturers on the public platform.
The prices of admission were alsot
arranged for so that there could be
mo "hold-up." v Season tickets are to
be $2.50 while single admission will
run from 50c to $1.00, according to en
tertainment
These entertainments are always
. worth double the price of admission
and are of educational advantage to
all vho attend and the committee who
have succeeded in landing this con
tract for Clayton surely deserve the
thanks of the community. Now let
everybody boost for the Chataqua,

The events of Jesus' life, from the

UNION
PLAIN FACTS mm
THE GOVERNORSHIP
The Santa Fe New Mexican, the of-
ficial organ of the McDonald Wing of 8tate, and thus be able to carry out his
the Democratic party, was the first ; plan to run for United States Sen
newspaper in the slate to intimate that ator from the Governor's offi'.c.
Governor elect E. C. de Baca might 1 McDonald did not realize his own
not qualify as governor on the first of ' weakness; few politicians ever do. He
January, the time appointed by the; thought his great task was to "p.it
constitution, and that Governor Mc-'de Baca across," so that he would be
Donald would continue to ' execute !
the duties of the office until such time
as Mr. de Baca was able to return to
New Mexico, and, in the event of his
death before his return, that Mr. Mc-1
Donald would continue to tct as gov-.
ernor for the full two years.
Now, because the republican press
has insisted that, in justice to the ex-
pressed wish of a majority of the vo
ters of the state, Mr. de Baca should
take the oath at the time appointed
by law, the New Mexican says that the
republicans are attempting to force
Mr. de Baca to return to the slate,
though his return should cause his
early demise. No such suggestion has
ever been made, so far as we are ad
vised, by a republican leader or news
paper. Our insistence, and that of
other republican papers, has been that
Mr. de Baca, in justice to the people,
and to carry out his repeated promis
es, made from the platform and thru
the newspapers, should take the oath
of office at the time prescribed by law.
This oath can as well be administered
to him in California as it can here,
and when it is filed in the office of the
Secretary of State, Mr. McDonald will
walk out as governor, and Mr. de Baca
will be the legal governor of the State.
If he is out of the state, or is in
capacitated, the duties of his office will
be performed by the Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Mr. Washington E. Lindsey. The
people have said, in unmistakable lan
guage, that if Mr. de Baca isn't able
to perform the duties of his office, they
want these duties discharged by Mr.
Lindsey.
But the McDonald Democrats don't
want Mr. de Baca to take the oath of
office, either here or in California.
They never did want him to become
governor of the state. The niirht be
fore he was nominated, they labored
with him incessantly in an attempt to
persuade him not to become a candi
date, and to permit Mr. McDonald to
be nominated. This is denied by the
Santa Fe New Mexican, but it is true
nevertheless, and can be verified by
asking any prominent Democratic
leader who was on the inside.
It is true that Mr. McDonald stated
publicly that he did not want the office,
but this is the way that gentleman
plays politics. At the first state con
vention when he was nominated, he
nid he didn't want the office, and nev
er did indicate that he would ncceptl
the nomination until after he had been
nut over by the convention. He was
attempting to play the Bame (rame
this time, but it diim't work. When
he found out that Mr. de Eaca would
be nominated, ard that he was sched
uled for the "toboggan slide," he got
busy with his close friends, and they
attempted to head oft de Baca in order
that "Mac" could be put across. But
de Baca wouldn't quit. He took Mc
Donald at his word and went out and
got promises enough to insure his own
nomination.
McDonald wants to succeed Albert
B. Fall in the United States Senate.
He has had this "Bee" in his bonnet
for a long time. He thought it would
ha nosier for h!m to be nominated and
elected from the governor's office,
'-ith his hand on the "political throt
tle" than it would as a private citi
zen. When he saw that he could not
get back in as governor, because he
couldn't be nominated, he pul'ed off
what he thought was a cute political
trick. He knew, as did everyone else
that Mr. de Baca was affiicted with
pernicious anaemia. In fact, when
Mr. de Baca made his speech of ac
ceptance he was so weak that he was
compelled to use a cane to assist him
to stand. Mac knew, as did everyone
else, that in all probability Mr. de
Baca would not live very long, and
that the man who was nominated as
Lieutenant Governor would oon be
come the governor of the State. Hence,
.the convention was startled and taken
completely off its feet by the an
nouncement that Mr. McDonald was
candidate for Hie oillce of Lieutenant
Governor.
He realized that if he could b
elected Lieutenant Governor, that he
would soon become governor of the
8Ure ta become Governor. Hence, he'011? cve of F66" f
i.directed all his energies, as did the
state committee, to elect de Baca. Not
a line was written, nor a dollar spent
to further the candidacy of another
man cn the Democratic State ticket,
gave dc Baca and Jones," and very lit-
tie was said about Mr. Jones. Mc-
Donald, in company with Ex. Gov.
Otero, visited every county in the
state, and covered Mr. Bursum with
slime. So vile were they that no other
candidate on their ticket would travel
in their company, save Mr. de Baca
who made one trip with them to the
Peros Valley. They succeeded in de
feating Mr. Bursum, but both of them
went down with him in defeat. Gov
ernor McDonald was overvhelmingly
repudiated by the people of his own
county, and ran almost 3000 votes be
hind president Wilson in the state.
Now the action of the people in
terfered materially with McDonald's
plans. If their will was carried out,
he realized that he would retire to
private life, and saw the chances of his
goinsr to the United States Senate
slipping away. What was he to do,
in order to retain his grip on the ma
chine, and keep in the limelight?
Subsequent events demonstrate that
he has not been asleep at the switch.
Immediately after the election, he
appointed one Elmer E. Veeder of Las
Vegas legal advisor of the Governor.
What did he need a legal advisor for?
He had refused to appoint one after
Mr. Wade resigned, because he said
he didn't need one and would save the
state the salary. After he was defeat
ed he only had two months to serve,
and had nothing to do save issue a
few reouisitions and sien commissions
for notaries public. When the facts
,are known, his act ia readily under
stood.
Mr. Veeder is perhaps closer to Gov,
elect de Baca than any other man in
the state. He has, for years, been de
Baca's legal and political advisor.
An article in the Sunday's issue of
the Albuquerque Journal let the cat
out of the bag, and throws an illumin
ating light upon the Governor s ac
tion. Ths paper stated that Mr. Elmer
E. Veeder, legal advisor to Gov. Mc
Donald, left for California to explain
to Gov. elect de Baca that he was in
no danger of losing his office by fail
ure to qualify on the first of January,
and that he could, with safety, remain
in California until his health was such
that he could return to New Mexico a
well man
Any doctor will tell the reader of
this article that pernicious anaemia is
ir.cural)'! disease, and that a pa
tient nfüictcd with it HI almost cer
tainly die within ei"hteen months
from the time the disease is contract
ed. This being true, the motive in
sending the Ic'nl advisor to Govern
or McDonald to California is at once
anparent. Mr. McDonald don't want
Mr. do Baca to take the oath of office
because once he takes the oath Mr.
McDonald becomes a private citizen
vith no duties of a public nature to
perform. ITe can't do much toward
furthering his chances of becoming
United States Senator by herding and
branding cattle in Lincoln county. A
man doesn't get much notoriety
"punching cattle," if he attends strict
ly to his own business. Hence he is
trving. by every means possible, to
persuade Mr. de Baca's close friend
was dispatched post haste to Los An
geles to assure Mr. de Baca that Gov
ernor McDonald would quietly and
peacefully surrender the office to him
it any time he presented himself in
?".nta Fe; that, regardless of his right
to qualify after the first of January,
no question would be raised by him on
this point
Of course if some other person
should raise the point, and the courts
should decide that Mr. de Baca had
abandoned his office by not qualifying
on the day fixed by law, that wouldn't

J. F. BRANSON NAILS
. AN ELECTION LIE
The following is a copy of an article
that appeared on first column on first
page in Clayton News under date of
Nov. qji, marked EXTRA:
"Execution Issued Against -Republican
Candidate
J. F. Branson, Republican Candidate
for Senator, to be haled into Court
In the possession of Lon Cash, un-
dersheriff of Union county, ia an ex
ecution issued by Judge Kingdom
against J. F. Branson, Des Moines
man, and the Republican candidate
for Senator whom the voters of Union
are requested to vote for Tuesday,
the execution is for the insignificant
sum of five dollars and is in favor
of Fifer Caudle, to whom the small
sum has been due for a long time, for
labor performed in repairing a gaso
line engine. The execution was issued
the latter part of the week and will be
served this week."

When the votes were counted after
the election and it was found that Mr.

tried to forget the above lie and
other things just as rank, and devote
my time to my business affairs, but
on November 20th, I was summoner
to appear at Clayxon on November 25,
to answer a charge made just before
election; evidently made for the same
purpose that the above lie was made,
which was defeat me.
After they had accomplished their
unmanly schemes they should have
called everything off but they did not
and would not let me drop it My
first step was on Nov. 25. I asked
Judge Kingdom and Lon Cash to sign
the above statements which neither
refused to sign, and I handed the
above, copied from the News, and
their statements to the press for pub
lication. The suit referred to has
been tried this week and I ask the
press to publish the proceeding and
evidence in de ail to enable the peo

WRESTLING
MATCH TO
BE HELD MONDAY
The sporting event of the season is
to bo staged Monday night, at the Mis
sion Theatre immediately after the
first show. The bout will be between
lack Collins, the cyclone of Nebrasl.a
and George Fallis, Champion of Ok
lahoma. These are the same boys who
made such a splendid shoe ing on De
cember 4th, when Fallis defeated Co'
lins after 46 minutes of the hardest
wrestling ever witnessed in this part
of the country. Cllins at that time
claimed that he was not in the best of
condition and challenged Fallis for a
return match which has been accept
ed and arrangements made for the
bout. Both men are on the ground
and are in the pink of condition. The
writer has interviewed the men, and
Collins informed us thnta ho feels con
fident that he will tie a bow-knot in
the vertibrae of Falliá und get off
with the winner's end. Mr. Fallis on
the other hand seriously doubts Col
lin's ability to perform this feat, and
expects to walk away the victor, hence
the rvalry wll put both boys on edge.
If you re a lover of good Bport by
all means be at the Msson next Mon
day night. (New Yenrs) and witness
this contest between the two best men
of their weight in the southwest
