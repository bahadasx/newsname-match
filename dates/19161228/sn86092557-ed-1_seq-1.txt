"WASHINGTON. D. < . Inc. 2k.? I)
Germany, U was made known Ii-to to-1 II
day, will not penult the road to peace
negotiation-! to lie blocked by h refusal
of tbo Entente belligerents to enter u
conference without prior knowledge
of her terms.
It has been forecusl that the Entente
powers would base a refusal on such a
condition. I y
The Central Powers are represented '
as willing to permit a confidential exchange
of broad tentative terms
through President Wilson should it be,
come necessary to do so to bridge the
gap which threatens to prevent a feath-,
erlng of peace delegate?.
There were broad Intimations today ; w
that u statement of this position by'.,
Gerrauny either had been eomniunicatud
to the United Status government el I 111
soon would be. j b
% Germany it. was said is looking to the i fi'
United States to make every effort to ; K
bring about a peace conference and to 1 "
that end is ready to consider any such
suggestions from the President. As j 'r
the case now stands the German gov- "
eminent considers it has met all the;1'
suggestions in the President's note i r'
and a statement to that effect has been j r
made by Count von Ilernstorff. the Get- j ul
