WHERE AMERICA STANDS
IN PEACE CONTROVERSY
President Wilson's message to
belligerents was not a "peace note."
but was sent in an effort to fore
stall what appeared to be an im
pending break with Germany on
the submarine issue.
It was sent as a warning, not as
a peace overture.
The object of the administration
is first to keep this country out of
war. Bringing about peace In Eu
rope is a secondary consideration,
predicated solely on the first ob
jective. No more notes will be written

The United States acted alone in

Financier Sends Representative

i
Big Shifting of Bank Accounts
i Predicted ext Monday,
j Congress Leaves Investigation
i of Tip Up to Wilson.
! Washington, Dec. 2S. OVer sixty
million dollars was made in Wall
I street by those having advance in
i formation on President Wilson's peace
; note, according to a telegram received
; today from Thomas W. Lawson by
j Representative Wood of Indiana.
The telegram follows:
"New York, Dec. 27. Just read to-
day's Xew York papers. You and
I Chairman Henry unable to locate me,
really! Framed over my desk is an
j envelope inscribed 'To Thomas W.
, Lawson,' no other address. To settle
a. wager, it was mailed in an interior
town in China and landed a: my Bos-
ton office in record short time.
"If you and Chairman Henry wish
to communicate with me, toss a post
card from any window in the capitol
! addressed 'Thomas W. Lawson or T.
j W. L., Boston.' and you will receive
', answer by return mail.
"Take a tip from one who played
'the big Washington-Wall street game
and the big international publicity
game long before you were -Id enough
to distinguish between a stock ex
! change and a congressional hall
' spend less time on last week and more
! time on this week's leak, which is lia
' ble to inundate both Wail street and
i Washington.
I Another Leak Coming.
"There were only sixty-odd million
i hogsheaded from last week's , this
: week's may run into billions,
j "And this tip, too, is mer.nt in the
best of spirit if it was actually be
lieved in Washington there was to be
a real investigation of last week's leak,
there would not be a quorum in either
the senate or house next Monday and
there would be a shifting of bank at- ,
counts " similar to those in the good
old sugar investigation days.
"Whether, or not 1 receive a post
card from you or Chairman Henry,
rest easy in the knowledge I will an
swer your public talking as reported
by the press and that when you digest
1 niy answer you will know more about
Washington-Wall street stock gam
bling leaks than before you began try
ing to locate 'Thomas W. Lawson, ot
j Boston "
! Wood said that at no time has he
stated he could not locate Lawson or
get In touch with him. He says he's
taken it for granted when the proper
time comes there will be no trouble in
reaching Lawson and getting a full
statement from him on what he knows
concerning leaks connected with the
president's peace note.
Wood stated further the reflection
cast by Lawson's telegram "upon
every member of the house and sen
ate." was sufficient to warrant tho
fullest investigation of all the matters
involved in his resolution and that the
senate and house out of-self respect
for each of these bodies should insist
on such an investigation.
Wood said that if the editorials ap
pearing in newspapers of the country
are any reflection of public opinion,
the public itself will insist in the full
est investigation, not only for the pur
pose of ferreting out those who are
responsible for the advance informa
tion received by Wall street, but to
prevent a recurrence of such a scan
dal. Plans No Investigation.
"Whether there will be a congres
sional probe of alleged "leaks" that
led to the Wall street peace panic rests
with the administration. Leaders in
congress have made it plain that an
investigation will not be ordered until
the administration says the word.
To find out precisely what the ad
ministration wants done Chairman
Henry of the house rules committee
arranged to confer with Secretary
Lansing before congress reconvenes,
concerning the desirability of a report
on the Wood resolution, demanding
, the inquiry. Unless the state depart
i ment concludes that good can com
! of the probe, the Democratic members
of the rules committee will permit the j
j resolution to repose in the commit
I tee pigeon hole. Representative
! Henry, at his conference with Secre
tary Lansing, will discuss the charge
of Thomas W. Lawson that advance !
information reached stock speculators
thru "leaks" on the president's peace
message. j
Chairman Henry stated that if ad- 1
ministration officials believe that a
public hearing should be conducted
and Mr. Lawson's testimony should be
deemed valuable, the latter will be
summoned to Washington, altho per
sonally, he said, he regarded Mr.
Lawson's statement of alleged "leaks"
as "all bluff." He asserted that he did
not believe that good faith character
ized the demand for a probe.
FRENCH AVIATOR
SHOOTS DOWN HIS
25TH AEROPLANE
Paris, Dec. 28. Sub-Lieutenant
Guyenemer, France's premier aviator,
has brought down his twenty-fifth
German aeroplane, today's official

tailed considerable aerial activity on
the western front, with aerial bom-

Teutons Now Occupy Seven
Eighths of Rumania.
ODESSA, RUSSIA, NEW GOAL
Capture 3,000 More Russo

Take Rimnik-Sarat; "ear the
Grain Stores at Braila.
- London, Dec. . 28. Attempt to in
vade Russian soil, north of Dobrudja,
or easjt of Moldavia, is the next devel
opment in Field Marshal von Mack
ensen's eastern offensive expected
here. Advance of the Teutonic col
umns is being opposed in fierce fight
ing by the Russo-Rumanian troops.
The German forces have lost heavily
in their northward advance and from
now on they will have even heavier
fighting cut out for them, as the
Russo-Rumanian lines are now at
taining their greatest strength thru
consolidation.
Very little doubt existed here today
in the minds of military experts that
Mackensen's objective was Odessa,
Russia. They recalled recent dis
patches from the eastern front, hint
ing that this was the point beyond
Bucharest at which the Teutons were
aiming.
Defenders' Army Safe Here.
Almost seven-eighths of the entire
territory of Rumania is now in Ger
man hands. Moldavia alone remains
free from the invader. But here the
Russian and Rumanian line is safe
from the sort of military tactics by
which von Mackensen and von Hin
denburg achieved most of their suc
cesses in the Rumanian campaign
flanking operations. On the west, the
allied front is protected by the great
Caiathian range and on the east the
rivers Danube and Pruth are safe

the resistance along this Moldavian
line and a halt put to the German
advance. Capture of Rimnicu-Sarat.

GET CARRANZA REPLY
Will Be Delivered to Secretary Ine
Ivate Today.
Washington, Dec. 28. General Car
ranza's answer to the request that he
either sign or repudiate the pending
protocol, which will be delivered late
today to Secretary Lane by Luis Ca
brera, chairman of the Mexican com
missioners, is understood to contain
suggestions or modifications which
have been carefully worded to avoid
ending the negotiations.
"The door hai not been closed,' was
the comment ot one Mexican official
who had read the reply. Further than j
that, no information was obtainable
as to what were its terms.
While Carranza was informed flatly
that the United States expected a final
reply last Tuesdry, it seemed possible
that the American commissioners
would not force an end of the negoti
ations if his reply, even late, was not
of such a character as to preclude
further consideration.
OFFER 30-CENTRATE
Vtilitics Commission May Try Another
Gas Peace Pact. I
The state utilities commission is pre
paring to hold out the olive branch to
the gas companies. Plans for an of
fer of a thirty cent rate to the Do
herty interests have been advanced
and the offer may be made by the
state commission at an early date.
A year ago J. Bristow wrote an
opinion for the state commission in
which he said 28 cents was ample. The
Doherty interests have refused to ac
cept the rate. In Kansas City today
Hugh J. Smith, counselor; and Mayor
Green conferred concerning a revision
of gas rates. Following the conference
it was admitted that the commission
might extend an offer for an increase
in gas rates, the new rate to be nlaced
at thirty cents a thousand cubic feet, j

FREEZE TO DEATH
Only 50 of 400; on Board
Wrecked Jap Ship Survive.
Give Up Hope for Lost Ameri
can Vessel, Maryland.
-i
Tokio. Dec. 28. Fifty survivors ojf
the passengers and crew of the steam
er Sankahu Maru, which was wreck
ed off Chefoo, landed safely, accord
ing to a dispatch from that city receiv
ed today. The survivors included two
American passengers.
'A few Chinese passengers escaped
by boats to Dairen before the other
passengers left the Sankaku.
Fear for Other 400.
- The fate of the remainder of the
400 passengers and crew who were
aboard the Sankaku when she went
aground is not made clear by the dis
patches. It is feared, however, that
many may have frozen to death.
First dispatches yesterday stated
that there were 400 passengers and
crew aboard the Sankaku when she
went ashore. Today's advices account
for only fifty Americans and Japanese
and "a few Chinese passengers."
This would leave the unaccounted
for approximately 350. Dispatches
from Tokio do not indicate clearly
the probable fate of these, except to
express the- fear that many may have
frozen to death.
Dairen, mentioned in the Tokio
cable, is believed to refer to Tairen,
across the Straits of Pechili from
Cheefoo. Tairen is a short distance
north of Port Arthur and about seventy-five
miles from Chefoo. The
point where the Sankaku Maru went
aground is located in cables as "o(T
Chefoo," probably near one of the
Miao Tao islands, between Chefoo and
Port Arthur.
Steamer Sunk; Crew Saved.
Galveston, Tex., Dec. 28. The Brit
ish steamer Istrar, of the Bates Line,
was submarined in the Mediterranean
near the African coast, according to a
letter .from one of the vessel's officers
to a relative in Galveston.
All of the crew, was saved. The
sinking of .the Istrar has not been of
ficially reported.
Slight Hope for Crew of 30.
Nantucket, Dec. 28. The steamship
Maryland was regarded as probably
lost today. Search for the vessel and
her crew by the coast guard cutters
Acushnet and Gresham, which was
begun after the Maryland wireless
calls of distress were suddenly silenced
Christmas night, was abandoned with
out developing any trace by either.
Flotsam found by the cutters could
not be identified as being from the
Maryland. Hope for the steamer's
thirty-odd men lies in the possibility
that they were picked up from the
ship's boat by a passenger steamer.
Sunk for Assisting Enemy.
Berlin, Dec. 28 (Via Sayville wire
less) The Norwegian steamship Delto
was sunk by the German naval au
thorities because she "was assisting
the enemy in a way contrary to neu
trality," Germany explained in a spe
cial statement to American Ambas
sador Gerard today.

it was unaccompanied by any other

Berlin, Dec. 28. A Vienna dispatch
says that the Austro-Hungarian gov
ernment today answered the Swiss

Rejects German-Made Proposal
for Peace Conference.
SPECIFY ENTENTE WAR AIMS
Conquest Is for Rule of Right
Over Might.
Will Reply to President Wilson
in Like Vein.
London. Dee. 28. Dispatch of the
allies reply to Germany's peace pro
posals is imminent.
Information todav indicated that the
phraseology of the identical notes, to I
be sent by all the entente nations, had j
practically been settled upon.
Russia's reply couched in the
terms agreed upon by the allies is
already en route to Paris, where it
will be handed the American ambas
sador, with France's note for trans
mission to Berlin some time within
the next few days.
From authoritative sources, it is
learned the allied notes will contain:
Why Allies Are Fighting.
A rejection of a peace based on
German-made plans.
A vigorously worded summary of
the principles for which the allies
contend they are fighting to re-"-move
the menace of militarism, of
might over right, of the rule of
force over international law.
Probably the allies will make still
clearer their aims and purposes by a
recital of the "crimes" for which they
propose to hold Germany responsible.
The note, however, will not state
specifically the terms on which the al
lies will consent to talk peace. Such
terms must be inferentially drawn
from the statement of the aims and
purposes for which the allies are fight
ing. It will not consent to the peace
conference urged by Germany. It will
not admit the timeliness of the Ger
man plea, nor of President Wilson's
suggestions.
Statement or Principles to U. 8.
At the sarhe time these allied- notes
go forward to the central powers, thru
the diplomatic agencies of Spain,
Switzerland and America, the allies
will probably forward an identical note
answering President Wilson's peace
suggestions. This note is IJkely to
point to the German reply and elabo
rate somewhat in meeting the Ameri
can president's plea for a statement of
principles.
Probably also it will emphasize the
importance to America of the estab
lishment, eventually, of a peace of
such permanence as to prevent all re
currence in the future of another such
world disturbance, according to au
thoritative information today. Such
peace, the note will point out. can
onlv be achieved by victorious estab
lishment of the principles for which
the allies are striving.
Begin to See Lansing's Motive.
The Daily Telegraph today, corrob
orating yesterday's dispatches, assert
ed that the entente notes as approved
by the allies will set forth in plain
words why the allies are fighting and
what they are fighting for.
In view of Washington dispatches
intimating that President Wilson's
note and Secretary of State Lansing'3
original statement that the United
States was "on the verge of war"
were based on the belief of American
officialdom that German submarine
warfare would shortly force the put
ting into effect of the threat of a
diplomatic severance with Germany,
made in the Sussex note, press and
public comment was noticeably less
bitter today.
Sees Germany Weakening.
London, Dec- 28. Germany is
weakening: her peace proffers come
from knowledge of that waning
strength and realization of the in
creased strength of her enemies. Czar
Nicholas of Russia asserted in army
orders sent to all Russian fronts to
day. "Germany is feeling that her com
nlete defeat is near and near aln
the hour of retribution for all her I
wrong doings and -violations of moral
law." the order said. "As in the time
of her strength she declared war. so
now, feeling her weakness, she sud
denly offers to enter upon peace nego
tiations desiring to complete such ne
gotiations before her military talent is
exhausted."
The czar declared his knowledge
that no Russian soldier desire peace
until the enemy is driven from Rus
sian soil and guarantees against repe-
ihiuii ui ijLuie ireacnerous attacks

Gilberg told the commissioners of

discouraged endeavoring to keep the

had not sufficient money to purchase
heat for the night and not sufficient
