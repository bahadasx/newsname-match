REPLY TO SWISS NOTE.
German Answers Along Same Lines as
in Reply to United States.
Berlin, Dec. 28.—The German reply
to the Swiss note was handed to the
Swiss minister today. It was an the
-same lines as the reply to the United
States. The text of the note to Switz
erland reads:
"The imperial government haa taken
notice of the fact that the Swiss gen
eral council, as a result of having plac
ed itself In communication with the
president 6t the-United States, is ready
to take action.and side with the United
States toward bringing about an un
derstanding between the belligerents
and toward the attainment of lasting
peace.
'"The spirit of true humanity, where
with the steps of the Swiss" gederal
council are inspired, is fully appreciat
ed by the imperial government.
"Tho imperial government has in
formed the president of the United
States that a direct exchange of views
seems to it to be the most suitable
means of obtaining the.desired results.
"Led by _the -same considerations
which caused Germany on Dec.. 12 to
offer her hand for peace* negotiations
the government has proposed a meet
ing of all belligerents at a neutral
place.
'In agreement with the president of
the United States, the government is of
the opinion that the work of prevent
ing future wars' can only be taken in
hand after (he present world war has
terminated. So soon as that time
comes, they wHI be ready to engage in
this autflime task.
"If Switzerland, which, faithful to its
noble traditions in mitigating the suf
ferings caused by the present war, has
won unending gratitude, will also con
tribute to safeguarding the world's
jeace the German nation and govern
ment^ will highly welcome such action."
Austria Answers Swiss Note.
"A Vienna dispatch says the Austro
Hungarian government today answered
the Swiss note by transmitting a copy
of the note sent to President Wilson.
Atr-accompanying note assured the
Helvetian government that the "noble
minded suggestion of President Wilson
met with a thoroughly sympathetic re
ception."
The mesage added thait the Austro
Hungarian government regarded the
Swiss action as evidence of the "noble
and humane disposition which: Switz
erland since the beginning of the war
has manifested taw.ardjall the bellig
erent*." -. -.

European Tradea Uniona. and Religioua
Bodiea Sand Meaaages.
The Hague, Dec. 28.—A flood of
cablegrams is belqg- sent to President
Wilson by trades unions, social welfare
societies, religions bodies of all de
nominations and other (organizations,
wishing him success in what they re
gard as his efforts to bring about peace.
The Dutch socialist party sent the fol
lowing message to the president to
day:
"The Dutch socialist party supports
in the strongest way. your initiative in
appealing to the belligerent powers to
accept your proposal."
The newspapers regard the actuation
rather hopefully with the exception
of the Telegraaf, which favors a war
to a finish and sneers at Germany's an
swer, using the woigs, "If It can be
called an answer." Tne\Telegraaf says
the central powers are grateful to Pres

Inasmuch as their idea of a durable
peace is to arrange things so, as to
avoid haying to give the territory
they have grasped."

Regardless of Supreme Court's De

-•cs^sa^-P
New York, De^SS.—Creation of a
federal commissiq^i»4ji decide disputes
between railroads pqji their.employes,
regardless of whether the United States
supreme court nuty Jiold the Adamson
act constitutional orsnot, was a sug
gestion whieh the chiefs of the four
railway brotherhoods intimated today
they might place before the conference
of the railroad managers. Representa
tives of both sides today went into ses
sion to discuss the terms of the Adam
son law. W. G. Lee, of the brotherhood
of railway trainmen, said:
'•I- believe, and some of the railroad
managers agree, that the creation of p.
federal commission of eight members,
four representing the roads and four
the brotherhoods, sitting as a court of
adjudication could satisfactorily dis
pose of whatever grievances might de
velop. The members of such a com
mission must be men who understand
their positions. But before becoming
members they would be required to
sever connections with either side. Such
a commission would hold hearings and
after deliberation would announce its
decision.''
According to the brotherhood chiefs,
the roads' representatives have already
considered, the idea of such a commis
sion. Mr. Lee would not say. definitely
that discussion today would.center on
the proposal.

said, was largely disregarded by cer

While congestion of traffic'* is some
what less at, present than recently, the
Improvement in conditions apparently
has not been as rapid as the commis

phases of today's hearing was the claim
advanced by certain railroad interests
that the commission' was without au
thority to issue such an order.

Steamer Delto Was Enemy Transport.
Berlin, via London, Dec. 28.—Tho re
ply of the German government to an
other of the American inquiries in re
gard to steamships sunk by subma
rines, in this instance relating- to the
destruction of the Norwegian steamer
Delto, with Americans in the crew, de
clares that the steamer was chartered
Sr transport purposes to a belligerent
government and hence its destruction
was legitimate. The reply says that
so far as was possible the safety of the
crew was provided for. The men were
given half an hour to enter the boats.
The weather was clear and the dis
tance to the. shore not excessive.
Thej settlement of the Marina case,
which hinges on the question whether
the steamship was & government
transport, Is being delayed pending re
ceipt of further advices frm Washing
ton. iThe American government has
transmitted for information two state
ments from the British government
claiming the vessel was engaged in
carying horses for east bound voyages
but under no engagements for west
bound trips, and therefore could not be
regarded as a transport.
There have been no further develop

^Protoool Understood to Contain
Suggaatiena, So Worded aa to Pre
vent U. S. From Ending Negotiations.
Washington. Dec. 18.—General Car
ranza's answer to the request that ha
either aign or repudiate tho pending
protocol, to be delivered late today to
Secretary Lane by Luis Cabrera, chair*
man of the Mexicatp commissioners, la
understood to contain suggestions or
modifications, which are carefully
worded to prevent a break in the con*«
ferencea.
"The door has not been closed," said
ono Mexican official, who had read the
reply. While Carranza was informed
flatly that the United States expected
a final reply last Tuesday, it seemed
possible that the American commis
sioners would not foroe an end to tha
negotiations if his reply, even late, waa
not of such a character as to preclude
further consideration.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the (Mex*
lean commission,, arrived here from
New York this morning, bearing the
answer of Carranza to the demands of
the American representatives that ha
ratify or repudiate the protocol signed
at Atlantic City. He made telegmphla
arrangements last night with Secretary
lane to submit the answer today.
Character of Reply Unknown.
iThe character of Carransa's reply ha«
not been revealed, but It is generally'
believed it is another suggestion for
modifications and contains the Insist
ence that the American troops hi Max*
ico be withdrawn unconditionally.
It has been understood here for aav-*
eral days that if General Carransa dl$
not return such an answer aa would
warrant a reassembling of the joint
commission the negotiations would bf
declared ended and that Q«neral Cart'
ransas &»t «s«a4or.
would return to MwUco leaVIng""the
embassy here In charge of a confiden
tial a«ent. This would not amount t#
a severance of dlpiomatio relations, be
cause In a strict sense there never haa,
been any. Such a turn, of course, would,
prevent sending Henry P. Fletcher.
American ambassador designate, to
Mexico City, and In short the situation
wuuld return to the point it occupied
before the commission's negotiation*
began.
Arredondo Denies Recall, 'a
Mr. Arredondo today denied pub-*,
ilshed reports that he had been recalled.
"It is absolutely untrue that 1 have
been recalled by my government." said
he.. "Nor 4o I know If the government
is contemplating summoning me. If It
should occur, as It did a few weeks agot
It would not be in the nature of myi
withdrawal from my post."
Murder of Foreigners Stopped,

risen Villa has altered his attitude to

any more foreigners. This appeal waa
sent to Villa during his occupation o£
Chihuahua City. The document, it wa»
said, reached him after a number
foreigners there were killed. The mes
sage to Villa informed him that tha
world was watching his movements and
urged guarantees to non-combatants
and protection to foreign property. It
