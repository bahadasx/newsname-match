Oil Drillers About Ready
Bowdoin Oil and Gas Company Hampered In Their Work
By Delayed Shipments of Material-Eight Carloads
Used - Expect To Commence Drilling Soon.
After having suffered many delays
in getting freight moved by rail the
Bowdoin Oil and Gas Company is
nearly in shape to begin .drilling.
Two care of drilling machinery are
now between here and Shelby and
operations can be started ten days
after their arrival. The company
intends to drill two wells immediate
ly, the first being located near the
northern end of Bowdoin Lake. A
substantial camp has been built
there to quarter the men.
Drilling an oil or gas well is a
hu. ness of greater proportions than
can be realized in any community
other than a producing oil field. It
t;s costly, the risks are many and
the operation itself is delicate. In
this case six car loads of material
have been shipped in and taken to
the location, these with the two now
on the way will make a total of eight
earloaeds or material necessary be
fore drilling could be begun. The
derrick, which has been erected, is
one hundred and six feet high with
a twenty-four base. The well will
start with a diameter of fifteen and
one-half inches and reduce in diam
eter from time to time, as drilling
progresses, so that at a dep'h of
2,500 feet the hole will have a diam
eter of 8 Inches.
Drilling is accomplished through
precussion or churning, the drill be
ing suspended from one end of a
twenty-five foot walking beam by
means of a cable. The drill and the
stem and attachments constitute a
rigid mass of steel ofrty feet long
and having a weight of several tons.
To locate a drill site with the ex
pectation of discovering oil and as
is he work of he geologist, and al
though there are many failures in
unksown areas, his work is marked
with a large degree of success. The
fundamental points upon which he
v orks are the knowledge that there
w 'e osrtain recognized formations
,:,a structure is conductive to accu
1. eation of oil and gas, are likely
to produce when drilled. By struc
1 9 I meant the form in which the
" , eta of these formations have been
4c t by the mountain making forces
v tin the depths of the earth.. It
! bees found that the best struc
t' is that where the stratas have i
I :. in the shape of an inverted
'v or bowl. Gas being the
1 e highest point. Oil being next i
tight will take its position at a I

point in the structure.

NEW OFFICIALS
TO CLEAN COUNTIES
Newly elected officials in many of
the counties are brealking lnto
print in an effort to inform the peo
ple of the wonderful things they ex
pect to do towards cleaning up the
counties. The new Valley county
Attorney says he will prosecute
every case where complaint is made.

IS
t- CONGRESS THIS WINTER
y
We do not anticipate that much
,e real work beyond passing the appro
a priation bills will be done in con
's gress during the short session. The
It Democrats won the election and
with the exultation over the victory
e there comes the natural reaction
d after four years of strain, and the
e unspoken thought in their hearts
:t is: "We are solid for four years,
a let us take a rest." Then there are
s some heart-burnings in the party
e and it will take adroit management
e on the part of the president to keep
the ill-feeling from breaking out.
- Two or three of the ablest Demo
a cratic senators, and they from the
south could not bear the infamy of
- the Adamson bill and openly de
- nounced it while itwas being con
- sidered.
a Only the danger of an open rup
ture on the eve of a presidential el
ection kept mostly smothered the
indignation that many felt. Then,
since the election Mr. Bryan has
been too much in evidence to suit
that class of Democrats who think
that statesmen has had his day and
t should subside. Then a multitude
of the Democrats feel that they have
- been absolutely dominated by the
r presideet for four years and they
t chafe under the thought.
We do not look for much earnest
work this next sixty days. They all
feel that the appropriation bills
- must go through, but beyond them
not much may be, looked for. Then
the Republicans may become thorns
in the side of the dominant party.
They are not in good humor. They
feel that they should with good
management, have carried Ohio and
California and that they were vic
tims of dishonorable trades in other
states, and they too are hot over the
way the chief executive has subord
inated coneress to his will. Unless
some suden danger arises there will
be little done this winter.
MALTA HIGH SCHOOL,

The excursion of the high school

On Thursday, December 21, Glas

[HE CALL AND THE
COUNTY PRINTING
JEnterprise Secures County Work
Because of Ability To Do Work
And Low Prices.
In the last issue of the Call there
was an extended wail sent up' be
- Jause it was not given the contract
or the county printing for the next
two years, and would give the read
'rs of that paper the impression that
the Call was not properly dealt with.
I'he editor of the Enterprise does
not claim to be lucky or anything of
the kind and our bid was not based
on luck, but on the cost of material
ind production. We admit the Call
was lower on some items than the
Enterprise, and the Enterprise was
lower on other items than the Call,
and when he says he would have
saved the county several thousand!
1ollars had he received the contract.
it shows just how little he kn ws
about the game, as the entire eno
i'act will not amount to that sum.
I ditor Flint says he does not
:ow wihi tlt' ELi terpr:se was fay
'lb with the contract, and the Call
rej- ted. It i, very plain to us and
if an explanation is necessary it is
as follows: The entire board of
county commissioners is made up of
men that know their business anA
are running the affairs of the county
to the best of their ability. One of
them is a practical printer and one
of the foremost editors in the state.
He knows the condition of the vari
ous printing offices in the county.
The law is very plain and says the
contract for county printine must be
'et to "the lowest RESPONSIBLE
bidder," The word "responsible,"
when the equipment of the two of
ecs and their ability to turn out,
the work, is taken into considera
tion, should settle all doubt in the
mind of our friend across the street.
No, P. Tt., it isn't oum good looks,
nor our health, that got us the con
tract it was simply our ability to de
liver the goods.
Still he goes further and says he
must wait two years before he has'
a chance to figure on the work and
eat of the county pie. If Editor
Flint has not had his feet in the pub- 1
lie trough for the past eighteen
months in the way of federal patron
pgo we would very much like to bell
referred to some one who has.

The switchmen had asked for an

BOYS' AND GIRLS'
WEEK AT BOZEMAN
A special feature of this year's
Farmers' Week at the State Col
lege will be a school of instruction
for boys and girls between the ages
of ten and eighteen. In the past
farmers and their wives have been
invited to come to Bozeman and
spend a week receiving instruction
along the lines of Agriculture and
home making. The boys and girls
were left at home. As a result few
of them know anything about the
work of the State College of Agri
culture and the fundamental prin
cipals of Agriculture which under
lie successful farming. It is safe to
state that ninety per cent. of the
young people who leave the country
and go to the city have never had
an opportunity to learn of the op
portunities that are found at their
very doors. They have seen only
the dark, hard side of farm life.
They have not be shown that when
the labor of the hands is mixed with
the labor of the head that farming
is not only the most attractive but
the most lucrative occupation open
to young people at the present time.
The old trite, yet ever true state
ment that it is hard to teach old
dogs new tricks is true of farming.
Better farming and home mak
ing will come when we teach our
Montana boys and girls the things
which we are attempting to teach
their parents. We must teach them,
however, from the lays' and girls'
standipoint. It goes without say
ing that a boy or girl so taught
will develop a strong incentive to
stay on the farm, t ohelp make it
more attractive, more profitable and
the whole community a better place
to live. Director Cooley and his
assistants realize this and are spar
ing no effort to bring boys and girls
from all parts of Montana to Boze
man during the week of January
29th to February 3rd. Lectures,
demonstrations and judging con
tests will be conducted by the dif
ferent departments of the college.
Every hour of the day will offer
something of interest and profit to
young people. The girls will be
given instruction in domestic science
dpmestic art, home management9
nursing and allied subjects. Par
ents of schools, clubs and other or
ganizations throughout the state
are asked to cooperate in making
new movement in Agricultural Edu
cation a success.

the agent will be asigned to teach
the tillers of the soil how to best

Tiine most. difficult tfling in deal

which one to deal with.
We've crowded a whole 101 into
this sinful old year 1916, mtost of
wit ch should he crowded out again.
The Maud Henderson opera com
pany of Harlem, returned home
Tuesday minus all their baggage ex
cept the clothes on their backs.
Fourteen trunks containing their
clothes, scenery, costumes and other
theatrical equipment, were complete
ly destroyed in a fire at Kildeer, N.
D., on the Thursday before, in which
they had been showing burned to the
ground. They were completely
stranded and unable to fill their ad
vance dates, so returned to H-al'lem.
They will remain there for a timf
until they can get equipment again
to finish the season.
The loss falls a teacy blow on
each member of the company and es
pecially on Joe Parent, the manag
cr. This calamity came as the cul
inination of n. couple of weeks of
hard luck. Blizzards in some places
prevented the people from turning
out, smallpox in one town prevented
them from getting a paying house
and several other obstacles one af
ter another beset them along the
route, until they were just about on
the verge of dispair, and then to cap
the climax they lost everything in
this fire.
The loss amounts to several
thousand dollars. Miss Anna Hughes
was probably hit the hirdest of any
of the company as her loss amounts
to about $1,200.
According to the reports the fire
started from a stove in the opera
house. A boy had been delegated to
build the fire to warm up the hall.
After starting the fire and putting
on a lot of lignite coa he left it and
hurried off to school. The next
thing known the building was eo
veloped in flames. It is thought that
the gasses generated in the stove
exploded, throwing the door open,
and scattering the fire on the floor.
This happened once during a per
formance. The fire had gained such
a headway that it was impossible to
save anything. In 20 minutes the
building was level to the ground.
The citizens of Killdeer knowing
the members of the company were
hard hit by the loss passed the hat
and in half an hour had secured a
purse of $200, which was given them

THE PASSING OF 1910.
With the earth covered in a beau
tiful mantle of white and the air
crisp with below zero weather, the
year 1916 will soon hobble off the
map and we will draw aside the cur
tain for the dawn of the new year of
promise. Old 1916 has been a good
year at that. It has been a good year
for Malta an dthe surouniding coun
try. It has marked another year of
progress for our city and farming
comm iuniity in general. Good prices
have prevailed for grata inti this in
