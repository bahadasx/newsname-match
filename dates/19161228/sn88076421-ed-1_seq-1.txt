SONS OF NORWAY
HOLD THEIR ANNUAL
YULEFE8T TUESDAY
Large Number Brave Elements Tues­
day Night to Attend One of the
Happiest of Social Events.
A large number of members and
their friends of the Sons of Norway
organization met at their hall, west
Central avenue, Tuesday evening, to
hold their annual Yulefest, which is
always one of the happiest events in
their calendar. The essence of "Peace
on Earth, Good Will to All Men" is
expressed in the Norwegian greeting
"Gladelig Jul," which was heard on all
sides at this happy gathering, and if
there was a dull moment spent or a
harsh, thought harbored, it was not
outwardly manifested during the en­
tire evening.
A splendid banquet had been pre­
pared, consisting of a large number of
both Norwegian and American deli­
cacies, which was served at 9:30
o'clock, "being preceded by a musical
program by Hovind's orchestra.
John Sveen presided as toastmaster
in a masterly manner, and at the con­
clusion of the feasting called upon a
large number of the banqueters who
responded in a happy manner, the
speaking being done, with but few
exceptions, in the language of their
adopted country.
TTie first speaker of the evening was
Peter Fugelso, president of the order,
whose remarks, though brief, were lis­
tened to with close attention. He was
followed by John J. Lee, R. A. Nestos,
Prof. Haugelund (the guest of hon
2*)' Martin Jacobson, Dr. Bonnichsen,
H. A. Martinson, Grant S. Youmans,
and.Isak Mattson, all of whom seemed
to be inspired with the gaiety of the
happiest season of the year.
Prof. Haugelund, who was the guest
of honor and principal speaker of the
evening, spoke in the Norwegian lan­
guage and spoke on "The Duties of the
Norwegian in America," showing the
relations of the Norwegian to his ad­
opted land and comparing them with
those of the native land. During his
remarks Prof. Haugelund referred to
Minot as an "oasis in the desert" and
•aid that owing to the hospitality of
the Norwegian people of Minot he had
spent the most pleasant Christmas in
his recollection.
After the speaking, the orchestra
played the overture, "In Norway,"
after which dancing was indulged in
until the morning hours, and it was

with reluctance that the happy gath­
ering dispersed.
A most noticeable feature of these
gatherings held by the sturdy Norse
people is the true spirit of democracy
that prevails. There is no such thing
as caste known to them when they
gather together for their festivities.
This was a very pronounced feature
of the gathering Tuesday night, and
one which more than any other gave
their "Gladelig Jul" a ring of sincer­
ity.
Returned From Brother-in-Law's
FuneraL
Herman Schwede, a prominent
farmer from Donnybrook, is in the
city today enroute home from
a month's visit in Wabash, New Ulm,
Fosston and Bemidji, Minn. His
daughter accompanied him. Mr.
Schwede and his brothers, Fred, Ed
and Louis, and sister, Mrs. Val Bott,
all from Donnybrook, were called to
Minnesota recently to attend the fu­
neral of their brother-in-law, Arthur
Kroueger, who met his death while
working on the new Masonic Temple
at Rochester, Minn. Mr. Kroueger
was an expert brick mason. The build­
ing was nearing completion when a
portion of the front gave way, allow­
ing the scaffold to fall to the ground,
fifty feet below. Four workmen fell
to their death.
The Schwede family comprises
twelve, six brothers and six sisters.
The six brothers are engaged in farm­
ing in North Dakota and are doing
well.
Thrilling Hold-up.
A thrilling hold-up is reported in
one of Minot's business houses at 3
o'clock Sunday morning. A stick-up
artist" who evidently wanted to rake
in the entire pot took a shot at young
Gow, who thwarted his plans. Gow
was shot in the eTbow, the bullet com­
ing out at the hand, and the injured
man, to save himself from more ser­
ious consequences, is said to have
dashed thru the plate glass, making
his get-away. The police were noti­
fied of the affair but no arrests have
followed.
Shanley Dougherty Died.
Shanley, the sixteen-year-old son of
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Dougherty, who re­
side on Sixth St. N. W., died Thurs­
day from paralysis. The remains were
shipped to the old home, Conway, N.
D., for interment. The death of the
young man was a severe blow to mem­
bers of the family, who have the sin­
cere sympathy of their many friends.
Whitney is Now Adjutant.
A. E. Whitney, second lieutenant of
Co. D, was recently promoted to Ad­
jutant of the North Dakota regiment,
which gives him the same rank as
First Lieutenant. Mr. Whitney's pro­
motion was well merited and his many
Minot friends are glad to hear of it.

ASKS REHEARING IN
GRANT YOUMANS CASE
Action Unduly Advanced and Justice
Denied Youmans, Declared Man
ahan, His Attorney.
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 23.—Contend­
ing that the hearing of the Grant S.
Youmans case against Governor
Hanna and other members of the for­
mer state banking board was "im
providently and unfairly advanced on
motion of the defendants," without the
knowledge of attorneys for the plain­
tiff that the motion to advance was
made by the defendant in bad faith,
and that the undue haste with which
the supreme court acted in the matter
denied justice to the plaintiff, Con­
gressman James Manahan, of Minne­
sota, attorney for Youmans, filed a pe­
tition with the supreme court this
morning for a re-hearing. The case
was the last one decided by the old
supreme court before the contest for
seats began. If the hearing is granted
the fight between Youmans and Gov­
ernor Hanna over closing the former's
bank will come before the new court.

The above is a picture of the C. M.
Christenson farm home, located in
Freedom township, fifteen miles south­
west of Minot. Since the picture of
the home was taken, a number of im­
provements have been added.
Mr. Christenson homesteaded the
land thirteen years ago and he has
made his own way, adding to his im­
provements gradually as he could af­
ford them, making the farm pay its
own way. He might be considered
ultra-conservative, yet the safe way
is often the best way and a man is
bound to win out in the end. Mr.
Christenson has a very comfortable
and commodious house, a barn 40x42,
granary, a hog and poultry house com­
bined 12x48, the buildings all being
permanently constructed. A 300-foot
well affords plenty of good water. Mr.
Christenson believes in diversification,
keeping cows, hogs, poultry and a
number of good brood mares on the
farm. While he does not farm on a
very large scale, he has never had to
Senator Mostad's Grandmother Dies.
Mrs. Tosten C. Mostad left Tuesday
morning for Belview, Minn., to attend
the funeral of her mother, aged 88
years, who passed away on Christmas
eve from infirmities. Mrs. Turi Rudy
was born in Norway and when yet a
young woman settled in Fillmore
county, Minn., where she has resided
ever since. She was a resident of Min
nesota during the stirring days of the
Indian massacres and was able to tell
.some thrilling experiences. She once
'visited at the Mostad home in Ward
county and will be remembered by
some of the old settlers. She was the
grandmother of Senator Thorwald
Mostad.
Salvation Xmas
Army Gave 50
Dinners.
The Salvation Army distributed
sacks of food, each sufficient for a
good Christmas dinner, to 50 Minot
families. Included in the lot were 155
chickens, bread, butter, and many other
good things to eat. Some of the food
was donated by the Minot merchants
and the remainder was bought by
money given for the cause. The Christ­
mas donations this year were better
than ever. Ensign and Mrs. Ellis, in
making the rounds of the city, found
poor families who will be assisted
during the remainder of the winter.
The Christmas exercises at the Bar­
racks Monday night were rendered to
a packed house. There was a fine
Xmas tree, Santa Claus, etc., and each
child received several toys, a sack of
candy and several apples.

Six Hundred Youngsters Given the
Time of Their Lives Wednesday—
Xmas Tree, Presents, Etc.
According to the annual Christmas
custom, the beautiful Elks' Home was
turned over to the "kiddies" Of Minot
Wednesday from three until five o'­
clock. So intensely interested were
the youngsters in the proceedings that
were to follow that many of them ar­
rived at 12 o'clock. It was a very cos­
mopolitan, good natured crowd that
E. L. Rowan, the genial custodian of
the Home, had in his charge. The
doors were not even barred to the col­
ored children. Twenty-five of the
wives of Elks had the children in
charge and saw that they were all en­
tertained properly. The entire home
was given over to the six hundred
youngsters. They were given ice
cream cones, presents, candy and or­
anges. A beautiful Christmas tree had
been decorated by Mr. Rowan and the
entire Home was decorated in the
Christmas colors, green and red. The
afternoon was spent in playing games.

buy a bushel of seed or feed during the
thirteen years. He owns a half section
of land. In building up this home,
Mr. Christenson has received valuable
assistance from his wife and often
remarks that he never could have done
it without her assistance. Mr. Chris­
tenson, with all of his work at home,
has found time to do considerable
well drilling each year, which brings
in an additional income of several hun­
dred dollars.
Mr. Christenson visited the live
stock show at Chicago recently and af­
ter looking over the possibilities in
the east, concludes that our opportun­
ities out in North Dakota are two to
one as compared to those other places.
"I saw farms in the east that didn't
look any larger than my door yard,"
he remarked, "but they seem to be
making it. We don't realize what we
are wasting here. I don't see why our
land isn't worth almost as much as the
land in the east if we will only work
it right."
LOWE MAY BE NAMED CLERK
Minot Attorney Said to be Scheduled
for Clerk of Supreme Court to
Succeed R. D. Hoskins.
Justice James E. Robinson announc­
ed that John C. Lowe, of Minot, who
I has been court stenographer in the
I Eighth Judicial district for more than
a decade, will probably receive very
favorable consideration from the new
supreme court when it takes up the
appointment of a clerk of the supreme
court. R. D. Hoskins, who has been
clerk for many years, will probably be
retired and it is said that Mr. Lowe
will without doubt be selected.
Mr. Lowe is regarded as an able at­
torney and an efficient court reporter.
Justice Robinson sent the following
I reply to a number who had applied for
the appointment as clerk:
"We want a clerk who can walk and
not weary who can run and not faint
I one who can get into training to fit
himself for the office of supreme court
justice in the course of a few years,
according to the rules of civil service.
We want a clerk of quick and clear
perception and good judgment who can
virtually decide half the cases cor­
rectly and present the other half in
such a way as to make it easy to de
I cide them.
e"
"We are starting out with new court
rules. The clerk must be in the office
from 8 a. m. until 5 p. m., except an
hour at tfbon. He must boss the judges
keep an account with them lay out
their daily work on their tables and
see that they report for work at 9 a.
m., and work during business hours.
"We have made a rule that on the
last day of every nionth each district
judge and judge of each county court
of increased jurisdiction, must file with
the clerk of the supreme court a re­
port of the business done by him and
the cases decided during the month
and the cases remaining undecided,
and the business disposed of on each
day and the time given to the same
•ana the court may call for additional
reports on any matter.
The clerk must make a similar re­
port for us, and each of us, and lay
v7
icv.
'/w ,hL
before us and direct special attention
to the report of the other judges. We
think the people who pay for doing
the work have a right to know how it
is done and to know the time that each
judge devotes to his work. We are
convinced that no court can be trusted
to do good work without some system
of supervision and reporting. That is
true of the U. S. supreme court and
the New York court of appeals. It is
reported they are nearly two years be­
hind with their work. Is it the fault
of their clerk?
"Now, if you think you can fill the
bill, please write us specifically on
each point. Do not think that you
will have to copy decisions covering
20 or 30 pages, because if I mistake
not, our decisions will be sharp, short
and pointed."
