FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Death Brings Most Profound
Grief to Family and Many
Friends.
The joy which the Christmas sea
son usually brings was transformed
into sorrow at the home of Mr. H.
J. Dashiell, No. 624 Main street, by
the death of his beloved wife, Mrs.
Sallie Sneecor Dashiell which oc
curred .about 7 o'clock Sunday even
ing:. She had been in bad health for
some time, and the untimely death
of her son, Mr. Frank Dashiell, who
was waylaid and murdered by a high
wayman last October, naturally had
a depressing effect upon her and is
thought by some friends of the family
to have hastened hernd.
Mrs. Dashiell, who was about 50
years old, was a native of Gainesville,
Ala., and was married to Mr. Dash
iell in that city in 1891. Since her
marriage she had resided in Colum
bus, and occupied a prominent posi
tion in social and religious circl's.
She possessed a voice of unusually
exquisite timbre and for many years
past had ntt only been a regular
member of the First Methodist
church choir but had appeared at
many amateur entertainments given
in behalf of charitable and eleemosy
nary causes. She was not only a de
voted wife and fond mother but pos
sessed an unusually sweet disposi
tion, and was loved and admired by
all who knew her.
Surviving the deceased are her
husband, Mr. JI. J. Dashiell, two
daughters, Misses Frances and Ida
Dashiell, a son, Mr. II. J. Dashiell,
Jr., and many other further removed
relatives. The hearts of many warm
friends go out to members of the
family in their bereavement, nnd the
Commercial joins these friends in
. extending sympathy and condolence.
Funeral services were held from
the First Methodist church at three
o'clock Monday afternoon, conducted
by the pastor, Rev. W. L. Duren,
and the remains were tenderly laid
to rest in Friendship cemetery. The
following friends acted as pall bear
ers: Honorary, Messrs. B. A. Wea
ver, George Sherman, F. P. Phillips,
P. W..Maer and J. T. Wood; active,
Messrs. W. II. Brooks, E. S. Moore,
J. I. Sturdivant, J. T. Searcy, T. W.

SOUTHERN ROADS
SHOW BIG GAINS
Interstate Commerce Statistics
Furnished Basis for Calcu
lation. Washington, Dec. 27. More than
$l,00p,000,000 net income from op
erations was made by the railroads
of the country during the year now
closing. The huge total is the peak
of prosperity in railroad operations
and stands more than one-third high
er than the total of 1913, hitherto
the banner year. Eastern roads led
in revenue per mile by a great mar
gin, With southern roads next.
Statistics gathered by the inter
state commerce commission, com
plete for nine months and made the
basis for calculation for the entire
year, indicate that the total net in
come from operations will be approx
imately $1,098,000,000.
For the first nine months of the
year complete returns show $785,
558,2C6. Even this does not repre
sent the amount, as roads whose in
come is less than $1,000,000 are not
included.
The estimate of $1,098,000,000 is
regarded by officials as conserva
tive. It makes no allowance for nor
mal increase in business during the
last three months of the year re
turns for which are unavailable
but places the income for October,
November and December at the same
figures as for July, August and Sep
tember. There is no question, of
ficials say, but that there will be
an increase; the only doubt is as to
it-- pi7,e. , ,
Analysis of the returns for the
first nine months shows a startling
increase from January to September,
amounting to more than 67 per cent.
Thus, net income in January, $G4,
915,286, had mounted to $107,910,
814 in September, an increase of
nearly $43,000,000.
For the first nine months of the
year the commission's figures show
that the railroads collected $2,054,
829,647 from all sources of opera
tion, the chief items of which were
as follows:
Freight, $1,875,019,990; passenger
traffic, $522,103,907; mails, $45,
348,609; from express companies,
$65,089,474; incidentals dining and
buffet car service, operation of ho
tels and restaurants, sale of vending
privileges on trains nnd at stations,
parcel rooms at stations, demurrage,
storage of freight and bggage, tele
graph and telephone wires leased to
other companies, operation of grain
elevators, etc. $60,414,597; and all
other transportation charges, $76,
087,611. The last item embraces
sleeping and parlor car service;
freight on milk, which has virtually
an express service; switching charges
and the operation of special trains.
This total, using the first nine
months as a basis, will reach $3,600,
640,502 when the year closes, offi
cials estimate, and without doubt will
exceed it. Never before in the his
tory of railroad operatons have the
roads had so great an income.
Expense has not kept pace with
the rapid rise in receipts, although
they have measurably increased.
From a total of $182,881,269 in Jan
uary expense had increased to $203,
235,394 in September, aproximately
11 per cent. During that period re
ceipts had increased from $260,054,
30G to $324,954,301, approximately
25 per cent.
The chief items of expense for the
nine months period for which returns
are available are as follows:
Maintenance of way, $320,157,
526; maintenance of equipment,
$441,750,069; transportation, $858,
973,536; traffic, $46,679,422; mis
cellaneous operations, $19,904,769;
general expenses, including adminis
tration, $61,996,428. AH operating
expenses totalled $1,744,160,022.
On the same basis, the year's ex
penses will approximate $2,346,990,
leaving net revenue from operations
$1,254,573,512. From the last fig
ure, however, must be deducted the
railroad's annual tax bill, approxi
mately $155,625,546, and bad debts
down on the books as uncountable
revenue approximating $965,928, a
total of $165,561,474.
About 230,500 miles of railroad
were in operation during lie e.

COTTON MARKET MADE
GOOD GAINS YESTERDAY
ADVANCE OF ABOUT 40 POINTS
ACHIEVED AT WEDNES
DAY S SESSION.
The cotton market has been rather
active since the exchanges re-opened
atter the Christmas holidays, appre
ciable gains having been made both
Tuesday and yesterday. Tuesday's
session brought an advance of from
12 to 22 points, while on yesterday
there was another net tain of some
thing like forty points.
At the close of business yesterdnv
afternoon New York spots were quo
ted at 17.35, January futures in New
York at 17.28, New Orleans spots at
17.25 and January futures in New
Orleans at 16.77. In the local mar
ket good middling was quoted at
16.75.
low 230,000; daring the latter part
of the year it exceeded 230,000. Us
ing 230,000 as an average, returns
show that for every mile of road op
erated in the country the railroads
will receive $15,655. in gross receipts
and a net income of $ 1,774, or little
more than 30 per cent of the gross.
Compared with previous earnings,
net income for 1916 shows an in
crease of more than 52 per cent over
the fiscal year of 1915, 59 per cent
over 191 1 and 34 per cent over 1913.
Wide divergence in receipts among
the roads of various sections is dis
closed. The over-burdened railroads
of the east have skimmed the cream
of the traffic. The congestion at eas
tern seaports and almost on "nil ens
tern roads has spelled, in glutted sid
ings and slow moving traffic, a flood
of revenue the like of which was un
dreamed of even a year ago. For
every mile of the 59,200 in the eas
tern group, more than $20,000 has
been received in revenue, and every
mile has earned a net income of near
ly $5,900.
While the usual eastward trend of
traffic, the great demands of nations
at war and the location of most of
the country's factories, munitions
and otherwise, in the east are at
tributed as prime causes for this con
dition, secondary causes attributed
are said to be in the fact that eastern
roads for the most part have short
hauls and traverse densely populated
areas. Especially is this noticeable
in the revenue from passenger traf
fic, eastern roads with 59,200 mile
having received almost as much in
passenger fares as all the rest of the
roads in the country put together,
with a total of 170,800 miles.
The railroads of the south, with
42,600 miles, come next to those of
the east in revenue per mile, with
$11,922, about 58 per cent of what
the eastern roads received. Net in
come on southern roads was approx
imately $3,500 per mile. On western
roads the revenue per mile was ap
proximately $11,217, with net in
come of $3,614. The western roads,
however, show a greater net income
in proportion to receipts than is
shown in any other section.
Percentage of net income to gross
receipts was: For the entire coun
try, approximately 30 per cent; for
eastern and southern roads, 29 per
cent; for western roads, 32 per cent.
The difference is attributed by of
ficials to careful additions and to
higher tariffs prevalent in the sparse
ly settled sections.

NEITHER DEMOCRATS NOR RE
PUBLICANS CAN ELECT A
SPEAKER WITHOUT AID.
Washington, Dec. 27. Revised
figures on returns of the last elec-
tion show definitely that neither
democrats r.or republicans will ha-.
a majority of the next House, ncees-
sary to elect a speaker, and that n j
handful of independents will divide
which iiide will control the organisa
tion.
Conceding seats to candidates, be
cause they are certain to participate
in the organization of the House, the
personnel now stands:
Republicans, 21 democrats, 213;
independents, 2; progressives, 2; pro
hibitionist, 1; socialist, 1; contested,
2. A majority is 218; hence should
either democrats or republicans win
both of the contests they still would
be short of a majoiJy.
All of the independents are main
taining strict silence regarding their
attitude on the speakership, h.it the
democratic and republican leaden
are agreed on how most of them will
vote, provided caucuses are held end
solidarity maintained by the two par
ties. Kelly of Pennsylvania, a progres
sive, who formerly was a member oJ
the House, is listed, as a democratic
probability, so is Randall, prohibi
tionist of California, who vot.'d for
Speaker Clark the last time, and
London of New York, socialist, sits
on the democratic side now and has
been shown favors by democratic'
leaders.
Schnll of Minnesota, progressive,
the lenders agree, probably would
lean toward a republican candidate
if convinced of his progressiveim.

E COMET TO SHINE IN

New York, Dec. 27. Unless some
thing unexpected occurs the world
will witness next spring a great heav

blazing forth night after night with
iU tail sweeping an immense arc
through the heavens, a source of ter

We may see again, as we did when

Chinese mobs trying to frighten away
the uncanny visitor with flaming
torches and savage races falling on
their knees in gibbering prayer to
the supposed deity.
We may even have absurd scares
among usually well balanced people,
who believe the tail of the comet will
sweep the surface of our Mother

them a source of minor danger, ts

BEAUTIFUL SERVICE HEIO
IT FIRST i E.
"WHITE CHRISTMAS"EXERCISES
SUNDAY ATTENDED BY
LARGE CROWD.
A beautiful "White Christmas"
service was held at 4 o'clock Sunday
afternoon in the main auditorium of
he First Methodist church, and an
! elaborate program was rendered.
Thj affair, which was one of the pret
tiost services ever held in Columbus,
r i attended by many people, even
tne galleries or the church being
crowded.
As the congregation sang "Joy to
the World," a huge electric star,
which was arranged over the altar of
the church, was lighted, and made a
most touching scene. After several
musical numbers and recitations,
three "wise men" made their appear
ance from the rear of the church dur
ing the singing of "Silent Night," and
as they slowly passed down the aisle
a picture true to life was made. This
was followed by the carrying of gift
to the altar by the members of the
different classes of the Sunday school.
Nearly fifty l'arucas were present
and went in a body to make their of
fering. Messrs. J. I). Cooper, R. M. Young
and G. E. Moss, represented the three
"wise men." They were well made up,
and took their parts splendidly. The
church was decorated in snow white.
Christmas trees at th Christian
and Central Methodist churches Mon
day evening were enjoyed by many
children.
Two hundred families were pre
sented with baskets by the Salvation
Army on Christmas day, and last
night a Christmas tree, loaded with
toys, was lighted at Faith's chapel,
in northwest Columbus, and many
children of the factory district were
made happy when they received gifts.

COLUMBIANS CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS IN ORDER

LITTLE DRINKING
AND NO ROWDYIS
Conduct of People Is Ciicum

to Do.
The holiday seuron now in progre-s
will probably be recorded as t'.u'
quietest and most uneventful Yul '
" niMiwry oi loiumou lor
quiet has prevailed sUadily, and Co
lumbus dining the past few days has

There was a good crowd on the
streets of the business district Sat
unlay night, but the behavior of the
people was circumspect and then-
were no disturbances of any charac
ter. Most of them spent their time
in making belated holiday purchases,
and were principally on the street
only during the time required to
journey from one store to another
or while waiting for street curs.
Christmas eve came on Sunday,
and the majority of Columbians evi
dently spent the day either at home
or taking the air in their automobiles,
as there were very few people on the
street. Conditions were much the
same on Christmas day, and had it
not been for the fact that the mov
ing picture theatre was open anil that
the Sabbath-like calm was broken at
intervals by the boom of a firecrack
er one might easily have believed
that the calendar had become twist
ed and that one Sunday had followed
another without a single intervening
day.
The orderly way in which the peo
ple conducted themselves is worthy
of more than passing comment. There
was little drinking, nnd if any Co
lumbians indulged too freely in the
flowing bowl they kept themselves
in seclusion, as no drunken people
were seen on the streets, nor was
there rowdyism of any character.
There were special services at the
local churches both on Sunday nnd
on other days sine the holiday sea
son began, and all have been well at
tended.
Leigh-Procter.
The mnrringe of Mr. Richard
Leigh and Miss Ine Procter, which
was solemnized at the home of the
bride in Houston, Texas, last Friday
night, was a surprise not only to Co
lumbians but to Houstnnians as well,
having been kept secret even from
the most intimate friends of the con
tracting parties.
Mr. Leigh, who is a native of this
city, is recognized as one of the
south's most successful educators.
He graduated from the University of
Virginia in IH'.Ki, and after having
taught for a short time in the public
schools of Columbus went to Houston,
where he became associated with the
public schools of that city. His merit
was soon recognized, and he rose rap
idly, having been made principal of
one of the largest and most impor
tant schools of the Texas city when it
was erected a few years ago. His
bride is a charming ami highly edu
cated young lady, being a native of
the Lone Star state and a member of
one of Houston's most aristocratic
families.

A telegram was received here Mon
day by Mrs. G. W. Boyd announcing
the death of her brother, Mr. R. E.
Craddock, which took place at San
Antonio, Texas, Sunday. Mr. Crad
dock was a sufferer from tuberculosis
and went to San Antonio more than
a year airo in the hope that the salub
rious climate would have a benefi
ial effect upon his health. The hope
proved a vain one, however, and in
stead of improving he grew steadily
worse until the end came.
Deceased was 38 years old, and is
survived by his widow, two children,
a sister, Mrs. G. W. Boyd, who lives
near Columbus, and two brothers,
Rev. E. P. Craddock of Iuka, Miss.,
and Mr. W. P. Craddock of Denver,

CONFERENCE ON
PEACE SUGGESTED
Powers Expect American Gov
ernment to Formulate Plan
of Procedure.
Berlin, December 27. Germany
and her allies Austro-Hungary,
Bulgaria nnd Turkey yesterday re
plied to the note of President Wilson
in which he asked that the belligerent
nations state the aims for which they
were fighting. The proposal is made
by the central powers that a confer
ence of the delegates of all the bel
ligerents be held immediately in a
neutral city. The tak of preventing
future wars, the official statement
says, can be begun only after the end
of the present struggle.
The text of Germany's answer to
President Wih.t.n-; t .: was trans
mitted to Janu-s V. Gerard, Ameri
can ambassador.
The answer, which also contains
the reply of Austria-Hungary, Bul
garia and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded suggestion made
by the president of the United States
of America in order to create a basis
for establishment of a lasting peace,
has been received and considered by
the imperial government in the
friendly spirit which was expressed
in the President's communication.
"The president points out what he
has at heart Bnd leaves open the
choice of road.
"To the imperial government an
immediate exchange of views seems
to be the most appropriate road in
order to reach the "desired result.
"It begs, therefore, in the sense
of the declaration made on Decem
ber 12, which offered a hand for
peace negotiations, to propose an im
mediate meeting of delegates of the,
belligerent states at a neutral place.
"The imperial government is also
of opinion that the great work of
preventing future wars can be begun
only after the end of the present
struggle of the nations.
"It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure
to collaborate entirely with the Unit
ed States in this exalted task."
The answer of the central powers
concludes with the usual dispomatic
terms of politeness.
