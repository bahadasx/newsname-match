III POUTICAL FIGHT
Biennial Struggle Is Begun,
With President Hill as
Object of Attack.
FINANCES IN DANGER
Gordon Thought to Be Mak
ing' Trouble St. Louis
Alumni Send Protest.
Kewspaper discussion of University
affairs, which comes at eacn menniai
session of the General Assembly, has
been accentuated by the antagonism of
the state auditor, John P. Gordon, to
President A. Ross Hill and other mem
' bers of the University faculty.
jlr. Gordon was defeated for re
election to a third term as auditor
the only Democrat on the state ticket
vbo failed of election and charges
that newspaper statements credited to
President Hill regarding the failure or
the state to meet appropriations to
the University were, in large measure,
responsible for his defeat.
The truth of the statements as to
the financial condition of Missouri is
not denied. Former Senator Ben M.
Anderson, who was defeated for the
Democratic nomination for represen
tative, is also, as usual attaching the
University administration. Under cov
er of these personal attacks a serious
effort is being made to create senti
ment to remove the School of Engi
neering from Columbia to Rolla. The
St. Louis Times has published several
urtiles attacking President Hill, while
at the same time urging liberal sup
port of the University.
Hoard Denies One Report.
A report from Jefferson City that
the Board of Curators would ask for
Doctor Hill's resignaUon was prompt
ly and emphatically denied by the
members of the board.
The Board of Curators is composed
of nine members, each appointed for
six years. The terms of three, Dr. J.
C. Parrish of Vandalia, C. B. Rollins
of Columbia and G. L. Zwlck of St.
Joseph, will expire January 1, 1917.
The terms of Dr. S. L. Baysinger of
Rolla, Judgo A. D. Nortonl of St. Louis
and Sam Sparrow of Kansas City will
expire in 1919; fhose of Governor Dav
id R. Francis of St. Louis, John H.
Bradley of Kennett and H. B. Mc
Danicl of Springfield, in 1921. Par
rish, Rollins and Zwick are Republi
cans; Nortonl is a Progressive; the
others are Democrats. Under the law
co more than five members can be
long to any one political party.
ST. LOUIS ALUMNI SPEAK
Forrest C. Donnell, president of the
St Louis Alumni Association, writes
on behalf of the association to the St.
Louis Times:
"ST. LOUIS, Dec. 19. Sir: An edi
torial in your issue of Dec. 1G, after
referring to the physical equipment
and finances of the University of Mis
souri, inquires, "Why has the Univer
sity been left to crumble in its physi
cal affairs?" and then answers, "Be
cause Prof. Hill has not been big
enough to force action. Because his
influence with the Legislature is lim
ited to immediate necessity.. Because
he has been unable to make legislators
understand the needs and require
ments of a great State University."
The editorial then declares' that "un
til a man big enough to undertake the
Job Is placed in charge of the work, no
progress will be made."
"As president of the St. Louis Alum
ni Association of the University of
Missouri, I protest against the unwar
ranted conclusion that the blame for
Its financial or physical difficulties
rests upon the shoulders of Dr. HIU,
ind I submit that to urge such a con
clusion would be most unfortunate to
fw university Itself.
Agrees Willi Some Statements.
"While I heartily commend the de
8fre of the Times to see the Univer
sal more adequately supported, and
asree with your correspondent as to
nel of better provision, yet the im
pression to be drawn from the head
toeg and body of his first article re
ining to the physical condition of the
( tylTersity could easily be a mistaken
- While the University is like
er state institutions in need of
ttre adequate support, yet to infer
Jkt its principal .buildings are
"shacks" and "sheds" is more sensa
om than accurate.
"U is true that its buildings are in
itiate and the old ones are cheap
klullt, yet in 1911. 1913, and 1915 the
kjislature made special appropria
tions for their repair and an examina-
of them will disclose that they

ent who contemplates sending his son
or daughter to Missouri University
need hesitate on account of its physi
cal condition.
Thinks Test Is Wrong.
It is to be regretted that the caliber
of a university president is to be
measured in the press by his ability
to "force action" by the legislature.
There are those who feel that skilled
ability as a lobbyist should not be a
requirement of a university president.
and that If the people of a State, or
their legislators, refuses to adequately
support its highest educational insti
tution, it is not the function of its
president to "force" them to do so.
But be that as it may, I assert that
Dr. Hill has succeeded most satisfact
orily In securing legislative appropria
tions and you are gravely in error in
charging that "he has been unable to
make legislators understand the needs
and requirements of a great State Uni
versity," and that he is not "a man big
enough to undertake the job." My
opportunity for knowing the work of
Dr. Hill comes from my having repre
sented the University as attorney from
1909 to 1914 and having had frequent
and Intimate later observation of his
work during and outside of the session
of the Legislature. If any legislator
has failed to understand the needs
and requirements of Missouri Univer
sity it has been his own fault and not
that of Dr. Hill, as those who have at
tended sessions of the Appropriations
Committees can testify.
"Appropriations Not so Bad."
"The apropriations to the University
at Columbia during his administration
bear eloquent testimonial to his abil
ity to convince the Legislature of Its
needs. The appropriation In the ses
sion of 1907 (the last preceding his ad
ministration) was $800,000. The ap
propriations since are as follows:
1909 $ 919.940.6S
1911 1,167,905.85
1913 1,559,500.00
1915 1.311.44L13
"The aproprtation of 1915 Is the only
one during his administration which
included nothing for new buildings.
"During his administration he has
succeeded in constructing 14 hand
some new buildings, seven of which
are fireproof six of them absolutely
and one in all essentials. These rep
resent an outlay of $900,000, which is
more than had been spent by the
State on buildings at Columbia in the
entire 69 years past h'istory of the Uni
versity previous to his administration.
".Misconception of the Facts."
"To say that Dr. Hill has not been
effective before the Legislature is to
disclose lamentable misconception of
the facts.Even in the session of 1915,
when selfish reasons aligned certain
of the most powerful members of the
Legislature against the University,
and when false charges of extrava
gance and misappropriation of funds
were used as weapons against the
University and Dr. HIU, he succeeded
in exploding every charge in public
hearing, and the resulting appropria
tion, exclusive of buildings, was the
largest In the history of the Univer
sity. "The reason for Missouri Univer
sity's financial difficulties lies far
deeper than the cause which you as
sign. The real reason Is the one
which The Times so capably discussed
nearly a year ago, viz., that the reve
nues of the state are insufficient to
properly support its institutions.
Says Revenue Is Lacking.
Tho Legislature has, for the most
part, been as liberal toward the Uni
versity as the finances of the State
..tii nermlL The trouble is not
that the Legislature fails to perceive,
or that Dr. Hill falls to demonstrate.
The trouble Is tfiat thT State has not

M. U. VACATION BANQUET
ENJOYED BY 150 STUDENTS
The. flimsy Idea that the spirit of
lonesomcncss and sentimentality is
cultivated in Columbia during the holi
days was made obsolete last night at
the eighth annual banquet given in
honor of the students remaining in
Columbia during the vacation.
Missouri Christmas spirit was
crystalized in an atmosphere of cheer
fulness. The war god was laid upon
the altar of sacrifice when 150 stu
dents of differing nationalities clasped
hands.

CLUB PLANS TO AID
G000 ROADS EFFORT
Speakers at Luncheon Talk
of Proposition for Better
i Support in State.
MAY KEEP UP WORK
Temporary Organization to
Arrange for Continuance
Dues Set at $2.
The Columbia Commercial Club
members assembled at luncheon ta
the Virginia Grill at noon today and
thoroughly considered the proposition
of forming a permanent organization
of the Motor and Good Roads Asso
ciation in Boone County, to be affiliat
ed with the state association.
E. Sidney Stephens, in explaining
the movement, said that the purpose
of the organization was to,obtain a
reision of the present road laws that
would remove the restrictions that
prevent the state from using the fed
eral appropriations for good roads.
Missouri's share of the good road
fund is $2,544,000, to be distributed
over five years. The first payment
was $169,000, and the second payment
of $339,000 will be made next June.
"We must have a state fund to match
this amount dollar for dollar, or we
will lose it," said Mr. Stephens. "The
Motor and Goods Roads Association is
an organization that will endeavor to
get the necessary legislation to bring
about the standardization of the seven
highways."
Dr. J. B. Cole, chairman of the tem
porary organization, spoke a few
minutes in regard to membership. He
said that the membership at the pres
ent was not sufficient to guarantee a
permanent organization, but that the
committee in charge will endeavor at
the next meeting to get the necessary
support to make certain the organi
zation. ' The membership fee has been plac
ed at $2, half to be turned over to
the state association, the other dollar
to be used for the local organization,

dents. Greeting Extended to Guests.
"At this Christmas season residents
of Columbia and members of the
Young Men's Christian Association ex
tend a welcome greeting to you who
are away from home," said Professor
Taylor
"The evening of good cheer has cm
bodied the spirit of good-fellowship
and brotherhood. Most of us seem to
be able to take ourselves humorously,
which is an essential principle in life.
After the days of toll and devotion
to our books, vacation comes, and we
give ourselves over to the hilarity of
Christmas spirit. Such spirit cultivates
the mind, body and soul.
'If I were asked," said the speaker
In his conclusion, "to write ten com
mandments for vacation time, they
would all express festivity. I would
begin with, 'do not work,' and the last
would be, 'have fun."
One-Act Comedy Is Given.
After Professor Taylor's greeting to
the students, a comedy in one act,
"The Loquacious Woman," was given.
The play was of more than usual bril
liancy in its setting, costumes and act

SANTA FE TO ST, LOUIS
Operations Begin in 1918
Says President Ripley
May Enter Columbia.
By United Press
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 28. The Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad sys
tem will enter St. Louis not later than
January 1, 1918. Phillip W. Coyle,
traffic supervisor of the Business
Men's League, said today that he had
received official word from President
Ripley that the roadj would be In a
position to begin freight and passen
ger operations in and out of St. Louis
by that date. The Santa Fe will ex
tend Its tracks from Carrollton to
Mexico and from Mexico will enter
St. Louis over the Burlington road.
About the same time the Chicago
and Northwestern Railroad now run
ning to Benald, 111., will come into St,
Louis, it is thought, over the free
bridge. The Santa Fe and the North
western, under joint, agreement, will
compete with the Terminal Railway of
St. Louis.
This announcement confirms the
report that the Santa Re will run
from Carrollton through Mexico and
strengthens the rumor that the tracks
will go through Columbia.
COAL SITUATION IS UNSETTLED
Difficulty Caused by Confiscation by
Railroads Says E. E. Brown.
That the coal shortage trouble is not
yet settled for the University was
made plain by E. E. Brown, business
manager, this morning.
"We received two car loads yester
day," said Mr. Brown, "making our
supply about 100 tons. With our pres
ent usage of from thirty-five to forty
tons a day, this will .not last very
long. We have ordered more, how
ever, and I expect two cars today. I
am sure we will have enough next
week to keep the Farmers Week vis
itors from being cold, and'l think we
will pull through the winter. The
trouble now seems to be in the rail
roads confiscating the coal they car
ry to run their engines and returning
it later, which they have a legal right
to do."

TIP NETTED SIXTY MILLIONS
Market Leak a Reflection on Repre
sentatives Says Investigator.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28. Sixty
million dollars was made In Wall
Street by those having advance infor
mation on President Wilson's peace
note, according to Thomas W. Law
son in a letter yesterday referring to
the Investigation proposed by Repre
sentative Woods of Indiana.
In Lawson's letter he 'did not say
whether or not he received a post card
from Woodsnr Chairman Henry of the
Committee or that he will advance any
charge in regard to the Wall Street
gambling leak.
Woods said at no time could he lo
cate Lawson or get In touch with him,
but he said there would be no difficul
ty in getting In touch with Lawson
and getting what he knows In regard
to the President's peace note, when
the proper time comes.
Woods stated further that the pres
ent situation was a bad reflection
upon every member of the House and
that the fullest Investigation of mat
ters involved in his resolution should
be made.
