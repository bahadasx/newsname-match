plans-Fail, Trouble With
Germany Is Expected to
Demand Attention.
WARNING IS HIDDEN

Break With Germany Is Not at All
Improbable as Result of Re
Jeetlon of Poace
Overtures.
America's relations In peace dis
cussions as they stand today:
President Wilson's message to
belligerents was not a "peace
note," but was sent In an effort
to forestall what appeared to be
an impending break with Germany
on the submarine Issue.
It was sent as a warning not as
a pease overture.
The object of the administration
Is first to keep this country out
of war. Bringing about peace in
Europe Is a secondary considera
tion, predicated solely on the first
objective.
No more notes will be written
Germany on the submarine issue.
The United States acted alone
in forwarding its recent message
and suggestions that Sweden,
Switzerland or other neutrals
were consulted resented.
[By Robert J. Bender. United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.—The fear
that if present peace negotiations fail,
this nation then must clear its slate
on the submarine situation with Ger
many, grew apace today.
But President Wilson intends to
push this peace work to the limit to
avoid possible subsequent unpleasant
ness with Germany If possible.
Both President Wilson and Secre
tary Lansing have decided to main
tain a discreet silence on this topic.
This Is duo, It is believed, to the
fact that they do not wish to appear
to be ^rearing a chip on the shoulder
when peace is being talked with even
slight hope of success.
There is now no mistaking, officials
believe, that President Wilson's peace
notes to the belligerents and the two
subsequent "explanations" by Secre
tary Lansing, in effect, constituted a
warning against any unbridled acts
of war that would Involve American
lives or rights. Since it has always
been this government's attitude that
violations which affect property are
not even to be compared to violations
wbicn affect life, the warning is gen
erally interpreted as being directed,
therefore, chiefly against the central
powers, whose submarines have not
only destroyed and endangered Ameri
can lives, but have also destroyed
American property admittedly in viola
tion of all rules of humanity and in
ternational warfare.
Officials, however, are trying not to
over emphasize this as they really
want to aid peace, and have already
put the government on record as not
Considering any change in the neu
trality policy at this time.
One autnority. however, repeated
that there will be no more note writ
ing to Germany and he indicated tnat
If Germany cuts loose with her sub
marines folloving probable failure or
peace negotiations, then a break must

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, Dec. 28.—Attempt to in
vade Russian soil north of Dobrudja
or east of Moldavia Is the next de
velopment of Field Marshal Macken
sen's eastern offensive, expected
here. Advance of the Teutonic col
umns Is being opposed in a fierce
fight by the Russp-Rumanian troops.
The German forces have lost heavily
in their northward advance, and from
now on they will have even heavier
fighting cut out for them, as the
Russo-Rumanian lines are now at
taining their greatest strength
through consolidation.
Very little doubt existed here today
in the minds of military experts that
Mackensen's objective was Odessa,
Russia. They recalled recent dis
patches from the eastern front, hint
ing that this was the point beyond
Bucharest at which the Teutons were
aiming.
Almost seven-eighths of the entire
territory of Rumania is now in Ger
man hands. Moldavia alone remains
free from the Invader. But here the
Russian and Rumanian line is safe
from the sort of military tactics by
which Von Mackensen and Von Hind
enburg achieved most of their suc
cesses in the Rumanian campaign,
flanking operations.
On the west, the allied front is
protected by the great Carapthian
range and on the east the rivers
Danube and Pruth are safeguards.
London now expects a stiffening of
the resistance along this Moldavian
line and a halt put to the German ad
vance. Capture of Rimfnicni-Sarat,
announced last night, was not unex
pected here.
Twenty-fifth Plane Wrecked.
PARIS, Dec.
28.—Sub-Lieutenant
Guyenemer, Prance's premier aviator,
has brought down his twenty-fifth Ger
man aeroplane, today's official state
ment asserted. The report detailed
considerable aerial activity, on the
western front, with aerial bombarding
expeditions on Rompbach, Dillingen,
Briey and Hagondange. Two French
dirigibles, it was stated, bombarded
factories at Neueklrchen.
South of the Avre, a German raiding
party was dispersed, the statement as
serted and in the region of Beauv
raignes, French forces successfully ex
ploded mines against German posi
tions. The crater of one of these
measured 140 yards In length and
forty yards in width.
German attacks on the eastern
slopes of Hill 304 were checked.
