TAKE CASE TO PEOPLE
Now Having Drafted a New Franehlao
Which Will Be Submitted to Vetera
on Initiative Ptltlerv-New Company
Declares Amendment Offered by
Sheets and Mathewa Impose Untol
arable Burdens.
Ou the ground that the several
amendments In the new franchise Im
pose burdens not Included in tbe
franchise voted by tbe people of Klam
ath Falls at a special election held on
November 14th. Kerns Brothers, own
era of tbe Xeno Powder company, re
fuse to accept tbe aew franchise. This
announcement waa made today by
Charles P. Stone, attorney for the
Keno Power company. -
"A franchise is being prepared to be
submitted to tbe voters of Kbonath
Falls by Initiative petition, and Kama
Brothers believe the-aime-wiM be ap
proved when tbe time cornea to vote on
It," aaid Mr. Btone.
Tbe new franchise was Introduced
at the city council meeting Tuesday
evening- by Councilman R. J. Sheets.
It is the same franchise voted by tbe
peoplo last month, with several amend
ment added. It is these amendments
to which Kerns Brothers object.
"Had these amendments been pro
posed at the time of submitting the old
franchise to the people of this city, the
Keno Power company would have re
fUKed the franchise at that time," said
Mr. Stone. "The amended franchise
is not w hat the Keno Power company
sought, and not what the people voted
on."
Tho amendments referred to were
printed in )elcrday's Herald for tbe
Information of the readers.
SUFFRAGISTS ARE
YET ON WARPATH
ARE NOT SMASHING WINDOWS,
BUT ARE FIGHTING PACIFISTS
IN ALL PARTS OF THE BRITISH
ISLES
LONDON, Dec. 17. (By mall) Eng
land's militant suffragettes are atill on
tho warpath. But the battle of the mil
itants has turned from smashing win
dows for vote to an energetic cam
paign against pasive war makers and
pacifist.
"The suffragette urmles are princi
pally fighting for big battles," Miss
Jessie Kenncy, one of the leaders, ex
plained today. "Most important is our
campaign to force England's ministers
to fight the war to a finish. We are
fighting In South Wales, where peace
cranks abound; we are fighting on the
f 'lvde. in Scotland, where pacifists are
'interfering with tho workero, and lastly
we are sending our workers Into muni
tion factories to help toward victory
b;- making abells.
i "We are fighting Lord Haldano and
Viscount Grey because we think, they
are- mainly responsible for a pro-Ger
man atmosphere wblch still pervadea
the foreign office."
M1b Kenney was recently arrwted
far eatiiB Lord If aldAM. torn war
minister, a "traitor" In public. Tbe suf-
fragettea blame Viscount Grey for
rtritatn'a failure to recognlie the pro
visional government of Venlialoa at
