BOOZE KING CONFESSES!
YACOLT
The happy chronicle of
Yacolt, Wash., Is continued
this week in It- faithful diary,
the Yacolt News.
The Yacolt High School
IJterary club lias had a meet
ing, of which the piece de re
sistance was a debate, "lie
solved, a piano is more neces
sary to the home than a
Ford." — Affirmative, Lois
Mi Mnun and Killth Cole;
negative, Bam Rotschy and
Ray Roper.
The girls won.
The bustle of affairs in
Yacolt 1* echoed iv the col
umns of the News. "S. 1111-
stromi of Vancouver was hero
seeing to business relating to
telephone affairs Wednes
day."
The only cloud, on Yacolt's
content seems to be that "Ow
ing to bad roads between here
ami Vancouver the Sunday
paper* will not be brought
out on Sunday during tho
winter months, but they will
be sent out Monday hy ex
press."
The city council has been
up aud doing.
UNIONS
OPPOSE
BONDS
At the regular meeting of the
labor council held last night, It
went on record as opposed .to the
bond issue for an army post, after
a general debate on the matter
lasting until nearly midnight.
It was asserted hy the delegates
opposing the bond issue that with
15,000 enlisted men, whose term
of service is three years, that there
would be fi.noo discharges a year
or about 415 a month, and a large
percentage of them would be
thrown on the labor market of this
city and vicinity.
Another objection raised was
that such a large bond issue might
cripple other necessary work of
the county.
These, coupled with the natural
antagonism tn anything pertaining
to "militarism" ln its present
form, were the principal objec
tions.

WILSON AT 60
FEELING FINE
(I 1,11. il In-.. I rici-il V\ir.-. I
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.—Pres- 1
ident Wilson is 60 years old to
day. From a "close-up" view he
looks at least 10 years younger.
According to Dr. Cary T. Gray
son, the president's private phy
sician. President Wilson never
was in better health. Plenty of
outdoor exercise is what has kept
him lit, Dr. Grayson says.
A deluge of rain prevented his
usual game of golf with Mrs. Wil
son, and he spent the forenoon
quietly with hope of an automo
bile ride this afternoon.
Three years ago, the president
was reported from time to time
as being in a bad physical condi
tion. He continually suffered
from colds, which held on tena
ciously. Walking and golfing have
driven away his weakness for
colds and his added weight gives
him the appearance of perfect
health.

the effect that—
"Tlie Tacoma Times seems
to bemoan the fart tbat Tn
i .una men have to come to
Yacolt to get spars for ship
building purposes. That is
nil right, but we wonder what
they will have to say when
Clarke county gets the Hrl
gade post which Tacoma is
making such an effort to be
placed in that part of the
state."
MEANS
HIGHER
WAGES
Mayor Fnwcett Thursday issued
a statement to the worklngmen of
Tacoma, pointing out specific rea
sons why the American Lake army
post will benefit them and urging
them to "get busy and put this
army post over" in the bond elec
tion.
The statement follows:
"You want to hold your job;
you'd like a better one; you want
more pay. That's right. But has
it occurred to you the army post
will give you the best chance you
ever had of getting them?
Fveryone a Consumer
"Ordinarily if 15,000 jjew men
came to Tacoina they would he
bidders for your job. But these
soldiers have a job they cannot get
away from. Every soldier ls a
consumer. He will make work
here but not do any. That means
more demand for your labor. Your
employer will need you more than
ever and your chances for increas
ed pay will be better.
"These soldiers will get about
$16 a month. That means at
least $240,000 a month to be spent
here. If tlie business man here
get that money they must give
servico for it and service means
more work for labor. Besides,
there will be the foodstuffs, cloth
ing, building and other things
Uncle Sam will supply for the men.
They all mean more work here.
There will be no lay-offs or four
days-a-week working for railroad
ers then. Teamsters, draymen,
longshoremen, railroaders, ma
chinists builders, cigar makers,'
bookkeepers, clerks, and all kinds
of laboring men will find more
work to do and that means greater
security in the job and more pay.
Hrlng In New Money
"Besides this new money ln cir
culation will put new life in bus
iness. If you want to buy a home
you will have more money to do
|it with. If you have a place to sell
other workers will have more
money with which to buy.
"ln the final analysis the labor
ing man ls the only producer and
the advent of 15,000 or 25,000
new consumers in this section can
not help but be a big boost for
these producers.
"The working man should real
ly be the biggest booster for the
army post bonds of any Tacomans.
Will Increase Wages.
"Tbe reason Henry Ford can
pay his workmen all $5 a day or
more ls because there Is a big de
mand for the thing they produce.
When the demand for the things
Tacoma labor produces Is increas
ed here by a new army of con
sumers coming In It will have the
same tendency to boost tbe price
of labor here.
"Get busy Mr. Worklngman and
put this army post over. It will
be your financial salvation."

"Million Dollar" Idea
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18, 1016.
Editor The Times: 1 certainly congratulate you and The
Times for the successful fight you have, made for equality IB
tourist fares between Northwest cities and California. I think
it is a victory which means more than any one can possibly
estimate at this time.
Your plan to advertise Puget Sound temperature in Eastern
papers (the "million dollar" idea) strikes me as well worth
while. If carried out on the lines you suggest, it ought to
prove a most beneficial method of publicity for Tacoma. I wish
you the greatest measure of success in carrying it out.

It Looks From This
as If Tacoma Wasn't
Much on Classical
By Mabel Abbott
What Is your favorite phono
graph selection?
Ten to one it's Hawaiian.
If so, then five to one it's
"Vaaka Hula Hickey Dula;" or
four to one It's the "Hilo March."
If It isn't Hawaiian, then ten
to one it's "Pretty Baby," or five
to one It's "A Perfect Day."
These odds may not be exactly
figured out, but they're conserva
tive, according to revelations made
by the leading Tacoma agencies
for the principal makes of phono
graph records.
L. C. S.s in Majority
A clever reader of The Times,
who signed himself "L. C. 5.," sent
a warm letter to the editor the
other day on the subject of "low
brow" vs. "highbrow" music. L.
C ; . 8. declared himself a "low
brow," and asserted that he and
his kind should "organize in de
fense of our class," as there ls
"great and imminent peril that the
songs that mean something to us
will be excluded altogether from
concert programs."
A reading of tho lists of new
records put out by the big record
companies—Edison, Victor and
Columbia —ought to he comforting
to L. C. S.; and a list of the actual
"best-sellers" of these companies
ln Tacoma within the last month,
proves that the L. C. S.s are in
the majority among the owners of
music machines.
What Sells Iteat
At Hopper-Kelley's, for instance,
where records of all the compan
ies are handled, the three best-
sellers at present are "Pretty
Baby," a song from the "Passing
Show," "Memories," and "A Per
fect Day."
At Filers, the best-sellers among
Columbia and Victor records are
"»>retty Baby," "Yaaka Hula
Hickey Dula," and "O'Brien Tryin'
to Talk Hawaiian."
At the Shaw Supply Co., the
three Edison records that go tiic
quickest are Hawaiians. "On l lie
Beach," "1 Left Her on the BOMI
at Honolulu," und "She Sang
Aloha to Me;" and the three fa
vorite Columbia records, are "She
Sang Aloha to Mo," "Pretty Baby"
and "She's the Stin.shine of Vir
ginia."
Classical Music Nowhere
At Sherman-Clay's, the winning
record is "Yaaka Hula Hickey
Dula," with "A Perfect Day" a
close second, and the "11110 March"
third but rapidly gaining.
"Classical music is nowhere, if
.ou go by number of sales," re
•orted the manager of the record
department In one of the stores.
"There are people, of aourse,
who want it; but they are com
paratively few.
"Artists have found thrs out;
|and they are singing popular or
: patriotic music, for the records.
I Farrar's 'Star Spangled Banner'
record sells 20 to 1 as compared
with any operatic record of hers
that we carry. Cluck, Evan
Williams, and all the other big
ones are singing what people
want.
Not True Everywhere
"Take the 'Hilo March,' a Vic
tor record. If it keeps up at its
present rate, it will catch up with
'Tiperary,' which was the biggest
seller ever put out."
The salesman put the "Hllo
March" in the machine. It is *
rhythmic little tune, with the
whine of the ukelele and the plunk
plunk of the Hawaiian guitar; but
why It should catch the popular
gar in preference to dozens of
others like it, Is not clear on *
first hearing.
"Yes," said a salesman In an
other house. "It's true every
body wants ragtime or Hawaiian
DID IT
TO AID
"Wo went to several cities in
west and Tex promoted a couple
of lights and we went broke.
"We had money enough to ;et
to St. Paul, and lie tried to get a
fight there and couldn't, and we
were broke in good earnest.
"We hadn't a dime. We were
up against It. And then 1 Wired
Holly for money and she sent us
$200.
"Later, when we were In Aber
deen, the man Dolly bad gone to
California with came to see us,
and showed us some letters from
Dolly.
Reciprocity.
"They said she wanted to come
buck to Aberdeen; that she w:is
broke nnd wanted to come back,
and that sho wa:; going to live
decent now. The man said he
WM going to get a divorce and
marry her.
"So I thought it no more thin
right I should lni|i Dolly, because
she had helped me."
This was the explanation given
by Mrs. "Tex Vernon," in federal
court Thursday morning, for her*
ing sent, money to Dolly Howard
in California to come to the room
ing house which the prize fighter
and his wife conducted in Aber
deen.
Case Near an I nil.
Vernon, whose real name is My
ron D. Kllgore, and his wife, are
accused under the Mann act.
They are both young. She is
only 23.
Dolly Howard looks still young
er. The plain language of the
prize-ring, the half-world and the
under side of things fal'a. with
strange effect from their lips.
They allege that Dolly Howard
was brought to Aberdeen to work
as a chambermaid ln their room
ing house, and that the money
sent her was in payment of a debt,
which is not yet entirely paid.
The case will probably go to the
Jury early this afternoon.
Endorse Post
Tho Arlington Park Improve
ment club notified Mayor Fawcett
Thursday that It had unanimously
endorsed the American lake army
post.
or similar music here. It is not
true In all cities, however. I
have worked tn towns where
classical records sold almost or
quite as well as popular ones.
