It was a banner meeting last
Thursday night and the association
decided to reorganize and "incor
porate not for profit" but simply
to buy the building which has
been occupied for the past two
years.
Mr. Norman L. Hanson, as ad
ministrator of the estate of Mary
Taylor, offered to give to the as
sociation the resedue of the estate,
as per provision of the will, for the
purchase of the building.
Members signed subscriptions
for almost enough to complete the
payment.
A splendid Dutch lunch was
served and greatly enjoyed.
Pipes, cigars and music closed
the evening's session which was
thoroughly enjoyable.
BANK IS CLOSED
PENDING PROBE.
Bowling Green, Dec. 2G. At the
Fii-st National bank here this
morning there is posted a notice
that, owing to the dcatli of B. C.
Harding, cashier, it lias been de
cided to make a thorough examina
tion of the bank before opening it
to resume business.

adopted Saturday, is posted.
The resolution closes thus:
"This is done in the interest and
for the protection of the deposi
tors." Nothing definite is given
out as to the time the bank will re
open, but it is believed that it
probably will take a day or two to
receive reports from those banks
in other cities with which it does
business.

Little Helen Strayer, aged 5, of

fect in her legs, tearing them to
shreds. Dr. Rhonehouse gave
every possible attention and then
brought her to, the Rhinefrank hos

Eggs for market should be the
most imporant source of income
from the farm flock, according to
M. C. Kilpatrick of the College of
Agriculture. There is a steiulily
increasing demand for fresh eggs
of good quality at profitable
prices. In addition, eggs are pro
duced with less labor than other
poultry products and are more
conveniently marketed.
Poultry for market should be
the second source of income. Under
present conditions, the larger part
of the poultry meat produced on
most Ohio farms is a by-product
produced and sold with little re
gard to the cost of producion. The
poultrynmn should plan his work
so that while producing eggs for j
market, he may obain considerable
revenue from the sale of broilers
during June and July, fowls dur
ing September and October and
capons from January to April.
Diffculty in starting gasoline
in cold weather may be relieved by
one of the following means :
Fill the water jacket or radiator
with hot water.
Heat the gasoline by putting a
bottle of it in hot water, being
careful to keep the cork off the
bottle.
Place a few drops of ether in
the priming cup or spark plug
hole. -
NEGLECTED COLDS G.UOW WORSE
A ctough that racks and Irritates
tKo throat may lead to a serious
chronic cough, if neglected. The heal
ing pine balsams in Dr. Bell's Pine
Tar Honey Nature's own remedy
will soothe and relievo tho irritation,
breathing will bo easier, nnd the anti
septic properties will kill tho germ
which retarded healing. Have it
handy for croup, sore throat and chron
ic bronchial affections. Get a bottlo

Learned judges of the supreme
court of Ohio are going to have a
lot to do with the future of a 5-year-old
Toledo girl says the
Blade.
They are going to decide wheth
er she will he Virginia Tailford or
Virginia Weil; whether she will
grow up with her brothers and sis
ters in the humble home of her
really, truly father and mother,
or in the more affluent home of the
foster parents, who claim legal
title to the little miss by adoption.
The little girl is all unconscious
of the fact that she is at the turn
ing point of her lifo, and probably
is more concerned about what
Santa Claus has brought her for
Christmas than she is about the
fuss that the judges and lawyers
and other grown-ups are making
over her, and which is to be de
cided soon after the holidays.
Under instructions from the su
preme court, Attorney Mark Win
chester is taking testimony, and is
to make his report this week. Then
the rival claimants for the child
are to appear personally before
the court January 3, for a settle
ment of the modern version of the
question which confronted Solo
mon. The little girl is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Tailford. The
father is a herdsman for the Crane
Bros.' dairy in Oregon township.
She is unusually pretty.
The mother, Mrs. Rillia Tail
ford, who is making the fight for
the recovery of the little girl, left
her husband October, 1915, be
cause of a disagreement, in which
a letter to him which she discov
ered, is said to have figured.
The mother took Josephine with
her to the home of her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Eller, at New
port, Mich. She left the other
three children with her husband.
Tailford brought Josephine back
and left her at the home of Mrs.
Daisy Provancha, 2907 Chase
street, from whom she was ob
tained by Mr. and Mrs. Herman
Weil, 51G Victoria Place. They
later adopted her. Weil is man
ager of the Home Furniture Co.
They changed her name to Vir
ginia Weil. In January last Mr.
and Mrs. Tailford adjusted their
differences and are living together.
The mother wants her little girl
back.
Tho legal dispute over Josephine-Virginia
revolves on tAvo
points, The juvenile court of
Wood county held that the mother
had deserted the children and pro
bated them to tho father.
The mother maintains she did
not desert the child, and her at
torney, Ben W. Johnson, asserts
that the action of the court, in ef
fect, held the mother guilty of a
criminal charge, abandonment,
without giving her notice and a
chance to enter a defense.
It is alleged also that the father
consented to the adoption January
10, last, but revoked the consent
three days later, when the parents
reconciled their differences. This
consent, it is alleged, was used
when the Weils adopted the child
in October last. For these reasr
ons, the mother alleges tiie adop
tion was illegal.
STOP THAT COUGH
A hacking cough weakens the whole
system, drains your energy and gets
worse if neglected; your throat is raw,
your chest nches and you feel sore
all over. Relievo that cold at once
with Dr. King's New Discovery. Tho
soothing pine balsams heal tho irri
tated membranes, and tho antiseptic
and laxativo qualities kill the germs
and break up your cold. Don't let a
, cold lingor. Get Dr. King's Now Dis

Burton C. Harding is dead, lie
pascd away Thursday afternoon
shortly before three o'clock with
out regaining consciousness. It
develops that he was self-slain.1
This has added to the shock to his'
host of friends in the city caused
by the slddcnncss of his death,
says the Sentinel.
No. cause for his act is known ;
but there is belief that he may
have been temporarily deranged
by a very hard fall which he sus
tained the day before his death
and which gave rise to tho story
of apoplexy. He had slipped on
the porch of his home and fallen
down the steps. He struck heavily
on the back of his head and being
a heavy man, tho blow to the base
of the brain was very great. He
complained of much pain that day.
Thursday morning he went
down to his work as usual but
gave manifestation of not being
himself and it was suggested that
he go home. A friend walked
part way home with him. Shortly
after evidently he went to the
Elks' club where he greeted broth
er Elks Later he was found by
members of the order lying on the
floor of an upper parlor of the
lodge. Nearby was an ounce bot
tle of carbolic acid, a two drahm
phial (and a one ounce bottle of
chloroform. That he had used
their contents was evident.
He was removed to the office of
Dr. Mercer on the floor below
where several physicians worked
over him three horn's. At two
o'clock he was removed to his
home on West Wooter street.
There heSpassed away.
Buron C. Harding was born in
Johnstown, O., June, 22nd, 1S70,
being 46 years old at the time of
his death. He went to Prairie De
pot at the age of .twenty years and
became station agent for the T. &
O. C. R. R. there. Later he added
a coal business to his activities and
was successful in it.
He served two terms as County

A Number of Perrysburg Homes
Were Lighted.

The custom prevails in many
citjes throughout the world and
will probably be universal in its
acceptance and practice.
