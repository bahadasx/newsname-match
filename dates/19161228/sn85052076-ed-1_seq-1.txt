Every Ixnly ought to know by this time that feerea
College admits no student who does not pledge himself
to let tobacco alone.
And everybody ought to know the reasons.
Tobacco is poison.
It is listed among the poisons in every up-to-date
medical book. .
It stunts the development of young men, and di
minishes the strength so that any man entering a race or
a contest has to give up tobacco.
t It is an enslaving habit; the man who uses it is mis
erable if he has to go without it. And it breaks down
the conscience and the sense of truth and honor.
Between two and three hundred young men broke
themselves of the tobacco habit in Berea last fall, and
nearly fifty found the habit too strong for them and had
to be sent home.
This week a neat placard is tacked up in every store
and public place in Berea with a polite request that men
who use tobacco will not tempt or seduce students into a
violation of their pledge.
Turning Over a New Leaf
Before another Citizen is printed we shall be in a
new year, 1917. Some of us are glad to be older, and
some of us are sorry.
Anybody who thinks knows that he is imperfect and
desires to be much better than he is. The first step trf
improvement is to see one's faults. The next step is to
resolve, by God's help, to cut these faults out root and
braneh.
It does not amount to much to just wish to be bet
ter; the thing is to mark of! one's faults one by one and
say, "I am going to quit that."
But the best way of all is to start new habits of good
ness. In cutting off a bad habit plant a good one in its
place.
The Heavenly Father gives us 1917 on purpose that
we may start and establish new habits of goodness.
Christmas Trees and Whisky
Which is best?
If we could have a Christmas tree in every district,
would it stop whisky?

President Frost's Invitation
Many times I have ridden over
the distant mountains juwt to call
at the school houses and invite the
linger lxys and girls to come to
llerea fr a term of schooling.
There is nothing which I would
rather do right now. I would glad
ly ford any stream or climb any
hill in order to reach the boys and
girls who have never yet been away
from home to school.
Hut this year I have spent all my
time and strength raising money so
that we could have more rooms for
our students to live in.
We have three new buildings this
year two for young women and
one for young men, each to contain
a full hundred students.
These girls' buildings are the
best Berea has ever had. See the
description in another place in this
week's Citizen. And now the ques
tion is whether yon will be one to
have a place in these new "dormi
tories" as we call them.
I wish to invite the boys and girls
who have never been away from
home to school. Let me tell you a
little about what it is like and what
the way, towns and places you have
heard of 'but have never seen be
fore. And you will meet other
young people from other places who
are coming to Berea just as you are.
And then you will meet the peo
ple you have heard of at Berea:
Marshall Vaughn, the Secretary,
who has been writing you letters,
arid the dean of the department you
are going to enter Edwards, if you
are coming for the Foundation

This tract of twenty-seven acres is

School; Clark, if you are coming
for some of the Vocational courses;
and McAllister, if you aim to be
come a teacher.
You know what has been best in
the school you have been attending.
There have been gome lessons that
you enjoyed and that you know will
do you good. Now, you are going to
find a great deal more like that
when you come to Berea, More
things are taught and everything
is taught in a better way.
Now what are some of the things
you want to know? To begin with,
you want to know what things are
to he known. And you want to
know the things that will help you
in life. Every hoy and girl that
amounts to anything is dreaming
of a home of their own which they
will have in a few years, they hope.
Now to get such a. home, and to
manage it when you get it means
knowing things, and Berea is teach
ing the kind of things you want to
know. Many a boy has learned in
Berea in one term more than in all
Ibis life about raising hogs and corn
and garden stuff and working with
tools; so many a girl in even
single term has learned more than
in all. her life before about cooking
and sewing and managing a house.
And liesidcs these, things, all stu
dents have free instruction in music
and a great many lectures about
different parts of the world, and
the great men of history and a
thousand other interesting and pro
fitable things.
Just remember two things about
the education you can get at Berea:
, In the first place, it will be a
thing, you can never lose
In the second place if you are
ever to have it you must get it
while you are young.
Let 11s greet you at Berea, Jan
uary third.
