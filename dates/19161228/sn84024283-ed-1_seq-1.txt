Why Kansas Stood Up For Wilson.
- (Colton, (Cal.l Information.)
(S. Robinson of Shiron, Kmisax, was
sont a copy of the Ooiton Daily
Courier in which appeared a criticism
of Kansans tor voting for Wilson. Mr.
Robinson, who has h"en farming in
Kansas for twenty years, is an uuole
of Wm. B. McKittrick. A letter writ
ten by him by way of reply to the afore
said Courier editorial is printed be
low.)' Sharon, Kansas, November 26 (To
: the Editor of the Colton Daily Couri
er) In your issue of the 20th inst. a
flaming article appeared about Demo
cratic) Kansas which for downright
spleen would be hard to surpass.
The rigid, oold fact of the matter :
is we went for Wilson because he has ;
conserved our interests and not that
of the rich plutocrats of Wall Street.
Under Republican reign interest was
8 and 10 per cent; under Wilson it
dropped to 5. Did we want money to
move our vast crops, the rich barons
furnished at high rates; but no-4he
federal government supplies us at
moderate rates., In fact, however,
you are correct; for, under a "peo
ples' President" Kansas has money
galore, and does not need help "S
formerly.
Just think that the last four years
should make such a reversal!
Under Republican rule, wheat, 75
cents; corn, 11 cents; hogs, 2 and. 3
cents a pound; yearling steers, C10;
and all farm products corresponding
' in price. The small profit yielded to
the farmers, eat up with high tariff,
farm mortgages foreclosed on every
hand, ruin relentless, poverty every
where, and all laws made to foster
the rich, and because Kansas left the
thrallddm of this party you deign to
malign us. Anyone who thinks should
see the Republican party is as crooked
' as a barrel of snakes and hasten to
purge themselves of its chicanery.
It seems" all states bordering on
Mexico were satisfied with Wilson's
policy and sustained him.
Americans have been killed In
Mexico under every President from
Lincoln down and nothing said about
it. ' :
- Five, billion dollars in gold piled up
in our coffers is not likely to meet the
opprobrium of foreign countries nor
cause him to desecrate our flag.
Wealth has always been rospected
and our country is freer from molesta
tion than any other neutral power.
It was Mr. Hughes' constant theme,
. yet he never In a single Instance stat
ed what plan he had in view or where
In he would have acted different from
Mr. Wilson; and with all his quibbling
and fault- finding he offered no method
different. As between the two con
trast would be invidious. The great
pyramid of Egypt and the fly on its
dome, the King of the Titans and the
dwarf at his feet, Hyperion and Satyr,
the towering eagle and the mousing
owl none of these Irlte similes show
the immeasurable distance which
separates the one from the other,
So It Is no wonder the common
people rolled up for the President
' plurality of over 400,000-the largest
ever given to a President.
It has been , estimated that if that
strike bad not been averted the pro
ducers would Jfove lost $50,000,000.
Think of the millions your state would
have lost In perishable fruit. Yelp
- all yon want to, but at least be just
Call this rescue cowardice, call it fol
ly; but recollect sensible people will
call It doing the right thing at the
right time. 8. Robinson.

Hop Cholera Control.
Hog cholera eradication work was
successfully carried on, during the
past year, covering fourteen counties.
In one county, the State Veterinarian,
under the Missouri State Board of
Agriculture, carried on the work
alone.
Iu thirteen other counties, the State
Veterinarian cooperated with the
agents of the Federal Bureau of Ani
mal Industry. Altogether, over 200
outbreaks, scattered well over these
fourteen counties, were reported and
placed under control. .
.. There wasNiucludea some open
range country, some prairie counties,
and three that might bev, classed as
strictly corn and hog raising counties,
They fairly represent the entire state
as to the prevalence of hog cholera
and the difficulties attending its con
trol. -
Personal investigation by the State
Veterinarian, and reports coming to
his office, indicate outbreaks, greater
or less in extent, in all sections of the
state-. There are few counties, if any,
in the state which entirely escaped
an outbreak of hog cholera during
the past year.
Under the plans pursued in the four
teen counties, the district school
board formed a nucleus of the organi
zation in each school district for de
tecting and promptly reporting out
breaks of hog diseases. The district
clerk acts as the official correspond
ent. This provides a permanent or
ganization without expense to the
state.
A near-by deputy state veterinarian
promptly answers any call to investi
gate outbreaks of hog diseases. He
draws no pay, except when on ' duty,
When bis work is done, his expenses
stop.
The work done in the fourteen coun
ties during the past year shows, be
yond a doubt, that hog cholera can be
controlled and at a very small ex
pense. There is every reason to be
lieve that the work can be made state
wide and carried ont in every county
In the state at a total cost less than
ons-nalf of the amount often lost as a
renlt of bog cholera in a single coun
ty in a single year.
Outlines of the plans of this work
will be furnished on request by Dr. D.
F. Luckey, State Veterinarian, Co
lumbia, Missouri.

Postal Savings Cain in State. '
The largest surplus on the history
of the Postoffloe Department Just
exactly $5,216,213 61 was realized
during the fiscal year 1816, according
to the reckoning of Third Assistant
Postmaster General Dookery. . '
In his annual report Gov, Dockery
points out that the 1916 surplus is the
the third in the four successive fiscal
years of. the Wilson administration
The deficit in the fiscal yean.1915, he
assert, was caused by the decline id
postal revenues that began in July,
immediately preceding the outbreak
of the European war, and continuing
in varying degrees throughout the
entire year.
"It is clearly apparent, therefore,"
Gov. Dockery says, "that the postal
services, if confronted with no
abnormal conditions affecting its
revenues, is self sustaining."
Gov. Dockery evinced particular
pride in the growth of postal saving
xystem under his immediate super
vision. At his suggestion, congress
this year amended the original postal
savings act removing the limit on de
posits and raising the credit balance
to 91,000 from 9500.
'The effect of the liberalizing leg
islation was an immediate and pro
nounced increase in postal savings
deposits," says Gov. Dockery. "As
the advantages of the new law be
came known the accumulated hidden
savings of the country flow to the
postal bankB, and are there restored
to the Circulating medium.
"At the close of the fiscal year
postal savings deposits amouuted to
$83,019,885, standing to the credit of
602,937 depositors, an average of
$142 67 for each depositor. Compar
ed with the returns tor the service at
the close of the previous fiscal year,
there was a gain of 20,335,177 in the
amount on deposit, 77,623 in the num
ber of depositors and $17.65 in the
average for each depositor."
The gain in Missouri was $337,711
the total for 1916 uei.'K $2,136,527 tor
1916, as against $1,799,356 lor 1915.

For Better Seeding.
It would add practical interest as
well as additionaltvalue to the farmers
institute or club meeting if citizens
would bring Bamples of farm seeds
Oats and wheat can be examined for
smuts, and demonstrations given as
to how the treating for smut is done
Clover and timothy and other small
seeds should-be brought to be ex
amined for purity. Demonstrations
can also be given to show how testing
for examination is easily done. Seed
corn will be examined and plans per
fected for testing each ear, so Bug
gests Samuel M. Jordan of the State
Board of Agriculture.
It would add interest to attach

OUR PUBLIC FORUAl
COUntV authorities,
of railroad difficulties and grievances is full. I am far from holding the
railroads blameless for some of the conditions with which they are now con
fronted. Not a few of them were arrogant in the days of their power, many
imxea m ponucs, some iorgot that Besides having a duty to their stockho'.d
ers, they had a duty to the public, some were guilty of grievous and inoxcus
able financial misdeeds. But In their natural resentment and their legitimate
resolve to guard against similar conditions in the future, the people have
overshot the mark. The proof of the
Si railroads comprising 41,988 miles and
ization, are in receivers' hands, and the
in iai5 is less than in any year since
ship has become longer and longer, far longer than it used to be, owing to
the difficulty of raising the necessary funds for tho rehabilitation of the
properties and for taking them out of receivers' hands, which difficulties are
largely due to the complications and delays resulting from the Jurisdiction
and views of stats commissions. .
"Railroad construction has practically stopped, the purchases by railroads
have been reduced to a minimum, so much so that, had it not been for the
windfall of the 'war orders' our steel and cognate Industries would have
faced an exceedingly serious situation. Railroad credit has become greatly
affected. It is true that faults of management and disclosures of objectionable
practices have been contributory causes in diminishing American railroad
credit, but from my practical experience in dealing with investors I have no
hesitation in affirming that the main reason for the multiplication of railroad
bankruptcies and of the changed attitude of the public toward investing in
railroad securities is to be found in the federal and state legislation of the
years from 1906 to 1912 and in what
narrow and frequently antagonistic

Chinese Sportsmen.
Foreign sportsmen in China have al
ways observed with curious interest
the maneuvers of native fishermen
and Hunters. When, for Instance, the
Chinese gather a harvest of mussels
and winkles, they go about it in an
extraordinary manner.. In the first
place- the fishermen are dressed like
hunters, in flowing costume, consisting
of a cowskln coat and stockings nil In
one piece with the hair turned inside.
The only openings in the garment, Into
which the wenrers have worked their
way foot foremost, are at the neck
and cuffs, which are securely tied be
fore the men enter the water. The
fishermen wade iu up to their necks.
As soon as their feet come In contact
with' any of the shellfish, which seem
to He In beds, the men loosen them ns
well as they can from the muddy'bot
tom of the creek nnd then bring up the
catch in a grasp net

ON RAILWAY LEGISLATION.
In a recent discussion of the effect of railway legis
lation upon railway development. Otto H. Kahn, one ol
America's leading financiers, said among other things:
"What with the regulating activities of 43 commis
sions besides the interstate commerce commission, the
adoption by state legislatures of rate-fixing measures,
extra crew bills, and all kinds of minute enactments (be
tween 1912 and 1915 more than 4,000 federal and state
bills affecting the railroads were Introduced and more
than 440 enacted) the enormous increase within the last
seven years In federal and state taxation, the steadily
mounting cost of labor, the exactions of municipal and
etc.. it will ha tAmttoA that tha ruti
pudding is in the eating. Not less than

spirit toward railroads of commissions

History of the Dahlia.
By a curious horticultural irony the
Jahlia, which has become the popular
fdol of our early autumn flower shows,
possesses a sadly prosaic history, the
London Chronicle remarks. It has
been developed from the Mexican tu
bers introduced about one hundred and
thirty years ago by the Swedish bot
anist, Doctor Duhl, for the purely
commercial purpose of supplanting or
supplementing the potato. They did
not "catch on" and the dahlia dish
soon disappeared from British dinner
tables, but our gardeners at once saw
the latent possibilities of the flower,
from whtyh they . have , cfoiv
l the
double- dsjlilia and other dl;htfuIT
floral fantasies. Thus the dahlia has
exactly reversed the fate of the red
clover, which came to us in the guise
of a garden flower but was found to
make fine forage. The tubers of the
dahlia, too acrid for our taste, are
still eaten in some parts of France.
Your Own Fig Tree.
It may interest you, says the New
York Sun, to know that figs can be
grown In pots, or in the open ground
in regions where there are three
months of warm weather. The fig is
less like the apple and the peach,
which ripen all their fruit at once, than
like the raspberry and the blackberry,
which ripen their fruits continuously
through the bearing season. Figs cou
tinue to ripen fruit until checked by
cold weather. For pot culture, the
fig requires about the same treatment
ns a rubber plant, and If it gets plenty
of water the fruit will ripen. Vigorous
plunts will have fruit In nil stages of
growth, from the smallest green fruit
to the ripe figs ready to be picked and
eaten.
He Knew.
A pretty governess was remonstrat
ing with her young hopeful, aged eight,
on the grounds of his incorrigible lazi
ness, endeavoring to impress him with
the seriousness of his offense. "You
must remember, also, Harry," she con
tinued, "that you've got to work while
you are young, if you want to be a
successful man when you grow up.
Look at your father, for instance. Why
do you think he stays late in his office
three or four hours every , week?"
Harry looked up suddenly. "D'you
know, Miss Jones?" he exclaimed. "Of
course I do," she replied. "Well," he
muttered, ns he drove his hands deep
er Into his pockets, "you keep it to
yourself. If mother got to know

A party of gentlemen Who were stay

DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE CHAIR
MAN ISSUES STATEMENT OF
FACTS AND FIGURES.
MANY ILLEGAL ACTS EXPOSED
Impeachment of Partisan Courts Wiil
Probably Follow Investigation of
Frauds Negro Colonization
Scheme Partly Thwarted.
Facts have come to light, since
election day, which demonstrate be
yond any doubt that there was an in
Bidious and widespread attempt on
the part of some of the Republican
state organisations to commit a series
of illegal acta leading up to the recent
general tlacticn, with the object of
casting a lot of fraudulent votes and
causing to be miscounted votes le
gally cast.
This concerted action on the part
of some of the Republican managers
was of such nature and of such wide
extent that it jeopardized the lawful
will of the people of this state as ex
pressed by their ballots.
So wrongful was this attempt and
so many instances of its existence
have come to light that we feel it is
due to the people of the state of
Missouri that these acts should be
made public and that they be put on
their guard In the future against any
such willful, malicious and wrongful
conduct on the part of a few unscru
pulous men. With that object in view
this statement is made and is given
to the public.
There existed a conspiracy to regis
ter and to vote, In the city of St.
Louis alone, thousands of negroes
brought here from places outside of
the state of Missouri only a short
time before registration day. They
were induced to register, as required
by the law of the city of St. Louis,
before they could vote. To support
that allegation we hereto append
few names copied from a report mad
by order of the chief of police of tho
city of St. Louis and now on file in
nIs office.T This -repot t.is th.e.iesu't
of a canvass that was made in order
to determine whether or not there ex
isted any fraud in registration and
was made before election day. It
contains nearly a thousand names of
persons not entitled to vote for vari
ous reasons specified in the report.
These names are just a few picked out
simply as giving substantial evidence
of the charge made and to point to
particular cases and individuals. The
report in part reads as follows:
Ward 18, Precinct 4. Louis Benlon, 424
S, Garrison avenue. Only six months In
city.
Ward 23, Precinct S Wm. L. handler,
40S3 W. Bell place. In the city only eight
months from Frankford. Ind.
Ward 23. Precinct 8 Robert Howell,
4068 W. Bell place. Hero only six months
from the Boutn.
vvard , Precinct 1 William Bradley,
404S Cook avenue. Hero only four months
from Arkansas.
Ward 17, Precinct 15 Charles Prich-
nrd, 3500 Tjiwton avenue. Only In city
tnree montns.
To furtner substantiate the cnarge,
attention is called to the fact that an
election was held in the city of St.
Louis during the early months of
1916, at which the question of negro
segregation was to be Voted upon.
This was a question of peculiar im
port to the uegro race. A special
registration was held, prior to the
election, in order that all who were
not. regularly on the books and who
were entitled- to be registered might
be so registered. After that registra
tion it developed that there was near
ly, but not quite, nine thousand ne
groes registered a3 voters. After the
rumors of nerra colonization had
spread through the country, and after
the reports had been dignified by com
ment 1 hereon by the attorney general
of tho United States, and after a hur
ried and cursory investigation at the
hands of the department of justice,
and after the registradon in the city
of St. Louis preceding the recent gen
eral election, there appeared nearly
fourteen thousand negroes registered;
an increase of nearly flvo thousand
In the city of St. Louis alon.
Besides registration of negroes re
cently moved here from the south,
there was an attempt to register and
vote many thousands of negroes who
had forfeited their right to vote be
cause of conviction of certain offenses
specified by law. Quoting from this
same police report, there are hereto
appended the names of a few of many
Individuals taken rrom mat report:
Word 22. Precinct 14 Abe Shelton. 426
Kninerly avenue. Served term of six
mnthB In city jail on charge of attempted
robbery: also term in city worKnuune 01
lx months for murder in second degree.
Ward 16, Precinct 1 Jumps Buckner.
2731 Papln street. Served one year In city
workhouse on charge of burglary. Bccond
deirfco, and larceny. ,
Ward 6, Precinct 14 Edw. Moore, 2343

workhouse on charge of burglary second ;
degree and lnrceny. '
Ward 7, Preclnot 10 Charles Postley'
fnMBR Priestly), 1414 Papln street. Served
two terms in penitentiary In Jollet, III.
Entirely separate and distinct from
tho names appearing on the police re
port there was made at the request of
tho Democratic state committee a list
of persons not entitled to vote because
thfy had been convicted of certain
crimes. The nameB of the persons,
tho offenses with which they were
charged, the fact that they were found
guilty and the sentence with which
they were punished, together with
jyne date of the sentence, were taken
rom the records of the courts of the
mate ol missouri. uu eiecuua uay
these men were challenged as they
appeared to vote and through the ef
forts of the Democratic state commit
tee some thousands of these illegally
registered persons were prevented
from casting their fraudulent votes.
With further regard to the city of
St. Louis that same police report
shows that there was a general and
wholesale attempt made to register
negroes and to have them vote from
houses where they did not live. Ex
tracts from that report are hereto
appended in order to give substantial
and particular testimony to the truth
of the above charge:
Ward 17. Precinct 6 Front Moore. 2741
Clark avenue. Not known at this ad
dress. Information given by William
Wright, same number. There is a Thont
Moore residing at 2747 Clark avenue.

And hundreds more Hlmllar instances.
Besides these attempts, there were
imported Into Missouri, on election
day, across the Mississippi river from
the state of Illinois into almost every
country from 20 to 175 negroes, who
were taken to the polls to vote. Tho
same thing was done across the . Ar
kansas border into the counties in
the southern tier of this state.
In various counties of the state of
Missouri, which it is not now deemed
advisable to specifically name, there
were made, and have been discovered,
attempts to miscount the ballots le
gally cast and to give to the Repub
lican nominees the advantage of the
willful miscounts so made.
' Iu various registration booths in
the city of St. Louis there was an
attempt made, on the part of the
members of the Republican organiza
tion, to register, so as to permit them
to vote, a great number of residents
of foreign birth whose citizenship
papers had not vbecn properly per
fected. As an instance of the wide
spread nature of this attempt, this
committee knows of one precinct in
St, Lou& city whtf& 27 persons were
brought in a hoiji by a member of the
Republican organization, each one of
"whom -ad-Ali?al ..naturalization pa- '
pers more than five years old, but
which papers had never been per
fected. Under the United States laws
such persons are not entitled to regis- '
ter or to vote and in this particular
precinct these men were not allowed
to register. In many other precincts
persons in similar circumstances were
registered at the instigation of mem
bers of the Republican organization
contrary to law and did vote.
There were various attempts made
by Republican officials to drag the
courts of the state of Missouri into
politics and to prostitute their au
thority, functions and powers to serve
the ends of partisan purposes which
are disgraceful in' themselves, and
which- tend to bring disgrace and
shame upon the whole state of Mis
souri. In one instance, in the city of
St. Louis, the judge of a high court
freed 96 negroes who had been ar
rested because of alleged fraudulent
attempts to vote and freed them with
out even requiring them to appear iu
court; without ascertaining whether
or not the men charged with the
crime, and out on bond, were present;
and did so over the protest of the
assistant circuit attorney of the city
of St. Louis, and after he had asked
that the cases be continued a suffi
cient length of time to permit the
facts to be Investigated and the per
sons, if guilty, to be prosecuted. The
act of the court, in this instance, not
only freed many persons undoubtedly
guilty, but it is our understanding
that it was so carelessly done that
there was freed at the same time an
individual arrested on an entirely dif
ferent charge.
There are several other instances
which have come to our attention of
official misconduct in office and which
are of a grave nature.
We believe a thorough, rigid ars.i
Impartial investigation will confirm
the truth of the charges above re
cited, warrant the Impeachment of
those who have for partisan purposes
prostituted the functions of the court,
and result In the conviction and pun
ishment of those "hlgherups" who
conspired to induce the ignorant to
colonize, and the vicious in other
ways to violate our election laws and
to try to thwart the will of the people.
The purity of the ballot boxes is
the foundation of the exercise of
rights and the mainspring of the ex
pression of the will of the people in,
this commonwealth. We hope that
all those citizens, irrespective of
party, who desire a full and complete
investigation of the ' recent frauds,
who desire the establishment of such
a condition as to render impossible
their perpetration in the future, and
who desire the punishment of all
guilty persons, will Join with us in
this attempt which we. believe to be
a crusade to maintain the righto
which were established by our fore
bears and handed to our 'keeping as
a trust that we might maintain and
Improve upon them and hand them
down to posterity in an undamaged
and an untarnished condition.
