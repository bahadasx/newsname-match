"Thero were only sixty-odd millions

It for granted that when tho proper
time comes there will bo no trouble
In reaching lawson and getting a
full statement from blm on what he

Wood stated further the reflection
cast by" Lawson'a telegram "upon every

sufficient to warrant the fullest Invei
tlgatlon of all tho mutters Involved in
his resolution, and that tho Senate nnd
House, out of sclf-resopct for each of
these bodies, should Insist on such on
Investigation.
Wood said that if tho editorials ap

to the Mexican situation a most

that Carrana's formal reply to the

Senor Cabrera arrjved hero from
Now York this morning, it wus
generally believer! ho would Insist that
tho American troops In Mexico be
withdrawn unconditionally.
It has been understood here for
several duys that If Gen. Carranxa
did not return such un unswer ns
would warrant a reassombllng of the
Joint Commission, tho negotiations
would bo declared ended and that Gen.
Cnrransa's Ambassador would return
to Mexico. This would not amount to
a reveratico of diplomatic relations
he.kJto In n strict sense thero never
havo been any. Such a turn, of
course, would prevent sending Henry

designated, to Mexico City and. In
short, thn situation would return to
tho point It occupied before tho com
mission negotiations began.
Kllsoo Arredondo, Carranza's dip

unqualifiedly denied publls.icd reports
that he had b?cn recalled.
"It Is absolutely untrue that I have

SURGEONS ATTEND ii
Many Women and Children
Among the Injured Dif
ferences as to Cause
A New York Central suburban train
of four steel cars, carrying passengers
from Peekskill and Intermediate sta
tions entered the lower level of the
Grand Central Station on Track 7 at
10.03 o'clock to-dny and crashed Into
two empty etel coaches standing at
the extreme end of tlie track against
the platform butnpera.
The shok broka.all the wlndowa cf
the first two cars of. the suburban train
and about forty passougora were In
jured, twelve of whom were treated by
Dr. Mrl-eod and his assistant. Dr. till
lenple, of tho Grand Central Station
hospital.
No report of the accident wns made
to tho police nnd at tho offlco of Vice
President Daly of the New York Cen
tral It was stated that none of the
injured passengers gave their names
nn'd that all woro able to go about
their uslnass when the surgeons had
patched up their cuts and bruises.
This statement Is disputed by pas
sengers on the train, who say that
some of the Injured wero quite pain
fully hurt nnd that agents of the
tallroad took tho names of everybody
who claimed to havo imstnlned Injury
of any sort.
Motor Knglnenr (leorgo Schneider
and Conductor Joseph Dlnaut were In
charge of the train trom Peekskill.
Most of the passengers wero women
and children, Ismnd for tho city on
shopping excursions. Tho big com
muting rush was over when the acci
dent happened.
As the train entered tho station
nearly nil the passengers left their
seuts and started down the aisles to
ward tho doors. The New York
Central officials say that Schneider,
who has been bringing trains Into the
terminal for a long time and has of
ten stopped his train right up against
empty enrs standing at the stub
end of the tracks, must have mis-
Judged bis distance this morning.
Schneider has mado no statement,
but trainmen pay tho brakes prob
ably norkod Improperly,
Tho moving train might as well
have encountered a (-olid body as the
two empty cars, for these cars wero
Jammed up against the massive plat
form bumpors. Although the train
was baiely moving, all the standing
passengers were thrown from thdr
feet, and the passengers In tho llrst
two cars were bombarded with
broken glass.
The crnsh was heard In the station
and attendants, hurried to tho lower
level. Screams of women and chil
dren resounded through the waiting
rooms as tho doctors reached tho
sceno.
Many more passengers would havo
been cut by broken glass but for tho
fact that the women on tho train wore
hony coats, which they had buttoned
nround their necks preparatory to go
ing Into the street.

WASHINGTON, Dec 28. Germany, It was made known here
to-day, will not permit the road to peace negotiations to be blocked by a
refusal of the Entente belligerents to enter a conference without proper
knowledge of her terms. It has been forecast that the Entente powers
would base a refusal on such conditions.
The Central powers are represented as willing to permit a confi
dential exchange of broad tentative terms through President Wilson
should it become necessary to do so to bridge the gap which threatens
to prevent a gathering of peace delegates. There were broad Intimations
to-day that a statefnent of this position by Germany cither had been

Theiu is now no mistaking, officials
believe, that President Wilson's note
nnd the two subsequent "explana

fect, constituted a warning against
any unbridled acts of war that would
Involve American llvos or rights.
Since It has been this Government's
