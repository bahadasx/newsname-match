IT WAS A WHITE
CHRISTMAS AFTER ALL
Fears of Superstitious Remov
ed By Sunday Storm 15 In
ches Total Snowball for
Williams .
"A Green Christmas and a
fat graveyard" is an old saying
in which many people believe,
and probably there js some
truth in it : for a snowless con
dition of the atmosphere in
late December likely bespeaks
a temperature too high for per
fect sanitation. But be that as
it may, there is a feeling on the
part of most people in a tem
perate or colder climate that
snow and Christmas should go
together and there is genuine
disappointment if they do not.
Very seldom has Williams
been without snow on Christ
mas day. The day had got so
near this year without snow,
that people were saying "we'll
"not have a white 'Christmas."
On Saturday the storm clouds
which had overcast the sky for
some time had nearly disap
peared by night and the prom
ise was for fair weather. The
night brot a change, however.
Snow was flying early Sunday
morning and by night the air
was full of pnow and big drifts
were in the street. Sunday
night several inches fell and
Christmas morning about a
foot of snow covered the
ground. Snow fell fitfully dur
ing Christmas day and by that
night there was fifteen inches
on the ground, as determined
by the Forest Service. Christ
mas night was the coldest to
date, the mercury going down
to 4 degrees below. Tuesday
morning was clear and bright.
And so Jack Frost and the
Storm King brought snow with
a snap in it and the supersti
tious and the fun loving are
pleased. -
STREET COMMITTEE DO
INGJ300D WORK
Paths Opened for Citizens
On Principal Streets- -Street
Force Works Early and Late
to Make Travel Convenient
Thru the activity of G. B.
Kirkpatrick, Chairman of the
Committee on Streets and al
leys, the citizens of Williams
k have been largely saved the
labor of breaking paths on the
sidewalks of the town. Sunday
evening the Town ditcher was
started, tho snow began to fall
oniy Sunday morning, and the
ditcher was kept steadily at
work opening paths on side
walks until the more thickly
settled part of Town had been
accommodated. The law does
not provide for the perform
ance of this work by the Town.
On the contrary, it is usually
assumed that each property
owner will clear the snow from
the walks in front of his own,
property. Chairman - Kirk-
patrick foresaw, however, that
unless he took hold of the mat
ter and put the Town's equip
ment at work on the job, paths
would not be opened in time to
serve the public. Doubtless,
the work done by the com
mittee on streets and alleys will
be appreciated and the verdict
fc will be, "well done !"
Mrs. Nichols, of Ash Fork,
v spent Christmas week with Mr.
nd Mrs. Prince Yoder.
2ND STEP IN THE
KLOCKVS. RIEMERCASE
In the matter of the estate
of Gustav Reimer, deceased,
Mrs. Eva J. Reimer has been
cited to appear before the
Judge of the Superior Court
December 29 and show cause if
there be any, why the prayer
of Mrs. Nellie Norene Klock
that Mrs. Eva Riemer, be re
quired to give bond insaid es
tate as excutrix or be removed
from such office should not be
granted. This is the second
step in what is destined to be
come quite a celebrated case
in court. The points at issue in
the case will be ably contested
and a -conclusion will probably
not be reached until the high
est court of the state has been
resorted to.
THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH
Rev. E. W. Boone held his
last service here last Sunday,

Mr. W. W. Bass of ' Grand
Canyon was in town Christmas
day to arrange for affidavits
relating to his assessments on
his mining claims in the Grand
Canyon. . Mr. Bass has done
the required work and wished
to make an affidavit to the fact.
Mr. Bass' claims are down
well towards the bottom of
the Canyon and about half a
mile from the Colorado river.
He has both copper and asbes
tos mines in the Canyon. Mr.
Bass' mines, both copper and
asbestos, are pronounced by
experts to be very rich. Their
present inaccessibility prevents
their profitable operation. Lat
er, Mr. Bass expects to have a
way to get his mineral to the
market.
Mr. Bass will go to Wicken
berg soon to spend the remain
der of the winter. He has min
ing interests at Wickenburg

will devote his time, while
there, to the -development and
improvement of his properties.

MUNICIPAL CHRISTMAS TREE
PROVES A UREAT SUCCESS
'THE BIRTH OF A NATION"
Netted Library Association a
Neat Sum.
Shakespeare says, "When a
woman will, she will and you
can depend on't. When she
wont, she wont and there's the
end on't." The success of the
Williams Public Library in se
curing the presentation of "The
Birth of a Nation" in Williams
for the benefit of the Williams
people is evidence that the im
mortal William was right in his
first postulate. It required persistence-
and tact to get the
company owning the films of
this play to send them to Wil
liams for presentation on the
screen of the Sultana, but the
trick was turned thru the de
termination and work of Mrs.
W. M. Hughes acting for the
association.
Mrs. Hughes wo.uld, and she
did. By rapid-fire correspond
ence she finally obtained the
consent of "the owners to for
ward their films and she then
proceeded to sell the tickets to
the show, with the assistance
of some of the other members
of the association, in sufficient
numbers to meet the expense
of the films, pay Mr: Reese for
the films which he intended to
present as apart of his regular
program and make a net profit
of -$39.30 which -was divided
equally between the library
association and Mr. Reese.
The Library Association felt
very well pleased with their
success. The profit was not
great, but the venture from a
financial point of view was a
bit desperate and except for
the energetic manner in which
it was attacked, would doubt
less have netted a loss. The
Association feels gratified that
they were able to present this
powerful and famous produc
tion to a Williams audience.
Otherwise it would not have
been seen.
Mr. Shakespeare's second
postulate is doubtless suscepti
ble of proof in Williams,

I In Spite of Raging Storm. An
Interesting Program "Well
Rendered
The entire success of the
Municipal Christmas Tree in
the Sultana Theatre Sunday
night is evidence that the com
mittees appointed to make the
arrangements for the tree per
formed their various duties
faithfully and well. A beauti
ful program was arranged and
it was carried out, perfect in
every detail.
The tree, a symetrical pine
,22 feet talj, was resplendent
with strings of glass beads and
different colored electric lights.
The first six grades of the pub
lic school were seated on the
platform, each dressed in black
gown and white cape, and ar
ranged in six rows on each
side, one above another, radiat
ing from the tree vas a-center
j.vxj.xuxij a uann. Kill eiwier
side in which the children's
faces were set like flowers in a
field of white. The higher
graaes were seated on the
front seats at the foot of the
stage.
The program was largely
musical. Christmas songs were
sung by the school children
with accom$ animent by the
School orchestra. The band
and the .orchestra also render
ed several numbers. '
The three recitations : one by
Dorothv Wilson : on hv Minnie
Hughes and the third by Junior
McConkey and Albert Ragen,
wcxc aypxupnate, wen renaer
ed and heartily applauded.
While the children were
singing "Santa Claus,"Santa in
the person of Larry .Williams,
arrived and came marching
down the aisle, , dressed .. in
Santa's own costume and greet
ed the children. His appear
ance was hailed with delight
and was the signal for bringing
in the Christmas presents of
candy and fruit. Several boxes
and barrels of goodies were,
then distributed, Santa remain
ing a few minutes to assistfand
then excusing himself to go on
his way to other Christmas
gatherings.
The presents distributed, the
spectators and audience were
dismissed by music.
The ' general opinion was
that this year's Municipal Tree
was in no way inferior to last
year s. it has been definitely
settled that there shall be a
Municipal Christmas Tree next
year and committees will be
appointed early in January to
be ready to start arrangements
