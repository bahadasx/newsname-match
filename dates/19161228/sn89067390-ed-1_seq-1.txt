Missouri Crop Report for 1913.
The contents o! thi Sinta Claus
stocking of the Missouri firmer are
this year valued at 8231, S83, 951. ac
crding to the annu.il crop report of
the Missouri State Board of Agriculture
which was m ide public last week b
W. L. Nelson, assistant secretary.
"Gratifying as are these returns,
which shows values twelve and one
half million dolhrs in excess of the
1915 figures," said Mr. Nelson, "there
is in them but little satisfaction for the
for the farmer. In the main, tl.e
figures represent paper profits onlv,
if, in fact, there is any profits. With
a corn crop almost 70.000,000 bushels
short of the 10-year average and with
wheat but little more than half a nor
mal harvest, there is scant surplus for
sale.
While prices for farm products are
high it is also true that the cost of
production due to decreased acre
yields and to the high cost of living,
which hits the farmer just as it does
everybody else was never before so
great. Were it not for the somewhat
higher prices now prevailing prices
which in racst instances do not cover
the increased cost of production
every pound of beef or pork, every
pound of butter, every quart of milk
and even every dozen cf eggs sold
would represent a loss. In view of
the proposed boycotte on many food
products to dissatisfaction due to
lack of understanding or to conditions
for which the farmer is in no way re
sponsible and over which he has no
controll there is grave danger lest
farmers, fearing for the future, dispose
of much of their breeding stock and
curtail operations generally. This they
may do instead of engaging more ex
tensively in live stock farming, dairy
ing, poultry raising and kindred ac
tivities. These are facts worthy of
the most thoughtful consideiation."
In arriving at the result, as publish
ed in the Missouri Board of Agricul
ture report, figures from each of the
114 counties cf the state are carefully
considered. Prices are for December
1. It should be born in mind that
8231.SSS.951 does not represent the
total value of all Missouri agricultural
products, but only such field and
garden crops as are enumerated. Orch
ard, dairy, poultry, apiary an I timber
products are all emitted. Nor is the
value of Missouri live stock included
in this report.
CORN' The Missouri corn yield f(,r
1916, as estimated by correspondents
totals 139.909.735 bushels. The av
cr.ige yield of corn for the list ten
years has been approximately 203.000
000 bushels. The 1915, yield was
220,235,191 bushels. The 1916 corn
crop was grown on 7,363,334 acres,
the average yield per acre being 19
bushels. The va'ue of this crop, a'
the estimated state price of 86.7 cents
per bushel, is 5321.294,523 con
siderably more than oue million dol
lars to the country. The 1915 crop
averaged 30.5 bushels per acre,
la the Northeast section th- vel'i
from 1,321,095 antes was 28,023,
911 bushel?, an avenge of 21 2
bushels a compared with the 1915
acre yield of 523. 1 bushels. At 84 4
cents per bushel this represents a val ie
of $23,654,912. St. Charles county,
with an acre yield of 34 bushels, leads
in average production. Audrain, with
3,315,060 bushels, is f rat in total pro
duction for this section.
The Northweit rect'on leads in total
corn yield and in iverage yield per
acre. This section, with 2,001,035
acres in corn, grew 43,563,901 bush
els an average cf 24.2 bushels per
acre. The value of the corn grown in
this seccion is placed at 82.9 cents
per bushel, a total of $47,163,952,
In 1915 this group of counties pro
duced 63.791.285 btithels of corn
valued at C36.462.324. She acre
yield was 31.5 bushelrj and the aver

In the Central section the yield
from 1,253,317 acres was 23,795.473
bushels or an average of IS 9 bushels
tier acre. At the estimated price of
9J.4 cents per bushel, the value ol
the can in this section is $21,523,643
Im 1915 the Central section produced
42,111,703 bushels, an average of 34.-
ushels per acre. In this section
Stline c.-ttnty is first with an avrrag"
yield of 23 bush 'Is per acre ar d total
production of 3,770,56 bushels.
The Southwest division ol the stale
hit hard by the very unfavoraile sea
son which made impossioie proper
planting and cultivation. In this crop
section the yield of corn is reported at
but 9.4 bushels per acre. The crop
was grown on 1,693,018 acres and the
total yield is 16,037,129. This, at
93.8 per bushel, represents a valve of
$15,053,495. In 1915 these same
counties produced 40,210,280 bushels
of corn, an average of 24.2 bushels
per acre.
The counties in the Southeast sec
tion report 1,094.871 acres ul corn,
with an acre yield of 21.4 bushels and
total production o! 23,484,321 bushels.
The value, at 88.9 cents per bushel,
is 20,898,521. In 1915 this sec
tion reported 36,119,587 bushels, an
average of 33.5 bushels per acre.
Quality of corn, taking the state as
a whole is rather low, being but 71.6.
Correspondents estimate 83 per cent
of the crop cribbed by December 1.
WHEAT. The Missouri wheat crop
for 1916 was harvested from 1,882,
840 acres and amunted to but 15,133
892 bushels. The average yield was
8.3 bushels per acre. High prices,
though, offset in part the loss. Corres
pondents place the price ol wheat on
December 1st. at $1.65 per bushel.
At this figure the value of the crop
would be $24,991, 948. However,
the average price at which wheat actu
ally sold is given as $1.27 per bushel
This on the total crop, represents $ 5
771,905 less than when figured at the
the December price a pice at which
but little wheat was marketed.
The total and acre yields of, wheat,
by sections, were as follow":
Northeast, 272,850 acres avenging

Evils Of A Fee System.
It might be called a paradoxical to
say that a going concern in business is
ever fined for an obscrveance of law.
Yet that is what happens whenever a
factory or other industrial establishment
in Missouri has been officially inspected
and lounJ to meet legal requirements.
Its owners are called upon to pay the
inspection fees. The owners are in
t fleet, and in actual fact, forced to pay
for the privilege of proving that they
have not been guilty of any violation ol
law. State factcry inspector Johnson
in his forth coming annual report will
say that proprietors are growing tired
of paying fees to the factcry inspector
and to other inspectors whose duty it
is to inspect the same pl.-.ces under
other sections cf the law. He will
urge upon the legislators the wisdom
and Justice of consolidating a number
of ixtsting inspection bureaus into one
all ol the ifTuials and employes of
which bha.ll be on a salary and under
the merit system securing appointment
only by exiinination calculated to prove
competency lor the work in view and
to coid ofli.-e during gjod behavior
and competent discharge of duty.
Tir.se are txcellent suggestions and
the inspector does some cungent r.as
oning in nuking them. "The fee
system I consider an insurmountable
barrier iu :ti t fh'cient wor oi this de
partment." he has said in a statement
issued Lt publication. It is an intol
erable evil and a blight on Missouri re
putation as a progressive American
state. No other state tolerates such a
sytem and to the others and to the
Federal Government it is inconceivable
that Missocri should fail to acknow
ledge her responsibility as a state by
failing to appropriate a single penny
from her treasury to protect the life
health, comfort or general welfare of
any of her hundreds of thousands of
industrial toilers. Globe Democrat,
Enforcement The Main Thing.
The demand for revision of the
election laws of Missouri however mori
torious it may be should not supplant
the main issue now, rhe enforcement
of existiug laws. The contest ol the
1910 election proved beyond contro
versy that a fair election had been held
under the old law. But it required the
co operation of all instrumentalities ol
government. There has never been a
self executing fraud prool election law
and there will never be one. Nor will
fraud be suppressed through forgiving
past offenses and relying on future
preventive statutes.
It is a matter of common knowledge
that there were certain offenses against
the ballot committed in the November
election in St. Louis and in Kansas
City and they are, well defined rumors
of similiar offenses elsewhere. Some
of these offenses were of such a charac
ter that the only redress is the punish
meut of the guilty. Every single case
of th'.s kiud should be relenitesssly
prosecuted, without fear or favor. Both
criminal aud civil proceedings should
be brought. It matters not how high
the offenders stand socially, profession
ally or politically or in whose interest
the oflenses were committed. Tne
results of other offenses may be and
should be corrected. The Supreme
Court has held that the purity of the
ballot is paramount to its secrecy. The
offender should be criminally prosecu
ted aud nobody should be permitted to
enjoy the fruits of their fraud. Con
tests should be vigorously pushed and
the public should be interested in the
development of the facts, no matter
whom they hurt or help. These of
lenses were a.l forbidden by existing
law and they should be punished un
der existing law.
Proposal Amendment to the elect
ion law should not be discomageel al
though they should be scrutinized
Calling a measure an honest election
law does not make it so. But offenses
against the ballot cannot be discour
aged merely by the devising ol new
election laws. The certainty ol punish
ment for violating the law is the only
thing that will strike terror to the hearts
of iffenders. Globe Democrat.
Hog Cholera Control.
Hog cholera eradication work was
successfully carried on, during the past
year, covering fourteen ainerent
counties. In one county, the State
Veterinarian, under the Missouri
Stale Board cf Agriculture, carried on
the work alone.
In thirteen other conuties, the State
Veterinarian cooperated with the
agents of the Federal Bureau ol An
imal Industry. Altogether, over 200
outbreaks, scattered well over these
fourteen counties, were reported and
placed under control.
There was included some open
range country, some prairie counties,
and three that might be classed as
strictly corn and hog raising counties,
They fairly represent the entire state as
to the prevalence of hog cholera and
the difficiliies attending its control.
Personal investigation by the State
Veterinarian, and reports coming to
his office, indicate outbreake, greater
or less in extent, in all sections of the
state. There are few counties, if any,
in the state which entirely escape an
outbreak of hog cholera during the last
year.
Under the plans pursued in the
huiteen counties, tie district school
board formed a nucleus of the organ
izition in each school district for de
tecting and promptly reporting out
breaks of hog cholera. Ihe district
clerk acts as the official correspondent.
This provides a permanent organization
without expense to the state.
A near-by deputy state veterinarian
promptly answers any call to investi
gate outbreaks of hog diseases. He
draws no pay: except when on duty.
When his work is done, his expenses
stop.
The work done in the fjurteen
counties during the past year shows,
beyond a doubt, that hog cholera can
be controlled and at a very small ex
pense. There is every reason to be
lieve that the work can be made state'
wide and carried out in every county
in the state at a total cost less than
one-half of the amount often lost as a
result of hog cholera in a single county
in a single year.
Outlines of the plans of this work
will be furnished on request by Dr. D.
Lucky, State Veterinarian, Colum
bia Missouri.
As To The Middleman.
Between the shipment of his pro
duce by the farmer and its purchase by
the consumer there is a mysterious hia
tus which, in the popular imagination
is peopled by sinister goblins called
middlemen, who are supposed to rob
the producr coming and the dealer
going with equal zest and to derive in
cidental amusement by the ghoulish
destruction of perfectly good property
They conduct their nefarious business
in ou-of the way aud rather smelly
places where nobody sees them but
their victims, and in times of ordinary
prices their existence is ignored by the
public. But when the necessities ol
the table begin to leap skyward in
values, the public turns a shaking
finger upon the place of shadows and
denounces the phantoms that inhabit
it. Now we do not pretend to know
what goes on within that middle king
dom of the provision trade. It may
be region of treason, strategems and
spoils, but many years of observation
have taught us that Senegambiaus are
not to be found iu every woodpile and
that a barn door is no', as piin as it is
supposed to be. In other words, we
have a queer sort cf an notion that
evidence ought to preceed a convict
ion.
We have seen the epidermis of the
middlemen completely removed by
federal, state and municipal investi
gator, not once but often. This is
not the first time that high prices have
aroused a popular c'amor for a reason
and a victim, nor will it be the last.
But wj arc unable to recall that the
case against him was ever proven. It
may be he is "sly, devilish sly." We
are not prepared to acquit him. But
in the face of the evidence we are.dis
posed to give him benefit of the doubt.
We are impressed by the fact that the
middleman in the provision trade are a
numerous class, too numerous to be
generally crooked without detection,
or to be continuously successful in con
spiracies against the public. It is a
sort of axiom of conspiricy that it shall
be small and seclect. And we have
noticed, too, in our occasional inva
sions of their odorous habits that these
middlemen are prespiring, shirt sleev
ed chaps who show no indication of
predatory plutocracy. Nor have we
been able to discover many of them
holding seven figurer places in the
mercantile registers or sitting in the
seats of the mighty. Still, a3 we said
before, it may be their superior sly
ness Globe Democrat.
State Revenue Problem.
In his address to his tax conference
Col. E. Gardner reminded Missouri
ans that the state revenue needs are
urgent and that it is idle to talk of
changes in the constitution as a solu
tion. Neither will a compliance with
the provisions cf the constitution and
the statutes by the State Boarl of Equ
alization meet this emergency. We
disagree with Col. Gardner as to the
duty of the board anl also as to the
ultimate effect of an eqiitable assess
ment, but as he has remarked, this
subject can be dealt with at the proper
time. Someway of raising money to
meet the deficiency ol 82.000.000 or
' '
more which will exist on January 1
and of providing for proper employ
ment cf the convicts that will become
ldle on that date throug i expiratton of
contrasts, is an imperative duty.
Col. Gardner proposes a schedule of
new taxrs (or state purposes to be levi
ed at once. In the main these taxes
would constitute a burden on busmess.
Some of the special subjects already
bear unsual federal taxes, but the fact
is not as important as competitive con
ditions. Public utilities, which do not
seem to be included in the proposed
plan, enjoy a monoply so far as con-
cerni of other states are concerned, Vat
most other businesses meet the keen-
est competition from neighboring
states, not only in the general market
but iu Missouri, owing to the freedom
of interstate commerce. Great care in
the levying of gross receipts and gross
productions taxes should be taken to
see that Missouri business is not seri
injured. It is doubtful whether increase of
the saloon license will add to the reve
nue, although it might be worth while
as a matter of regulation. A general
poll tax would be odious and not worth
the trouble of its collection. The sug
gestion that the State University be de
prived ol its inhertiance tax and that
all inheritance taxes go to the general
revenue fund is reactionary. It would
be far better if the State University
were supported by a definite tax and
did not depend at all on the whims of
the General Assembly or the governor.
Time now devoted to lobbying could
be spent in casrying on the work of
the university and there would be less
likelihood of the institution becoming
tainted with the political spoils system.
But almost any method of getting
the state past the present cti is in its
finances will be temporally acceptable'

The "Missouri Calf Club"
There are several "Calf Club" plans
in use in different states, the "Mis
souri Calf Club" as revised and im
proved by State Dairy Commissioner
E. G Bennett commends itsself to the
Missouri farm boy and girl, because cf
its simplicity and financial advantages.
"The Calf Club" is (in short) as
follows: Forty or more beys and girls
whose parents (or guardians) consent
to their each owning a heifer calf, are
organized into a club with elected
officers. Trie club selects some one
to buy the calves alter the members
with their parents havi by a vote se
lected the breed aud age of calves.
Purchased and delivered, each calf is
numbered a id each child draws anum
oer by lot, un.ier directions ol a com
mittee cf cluo members. "Calf dis
tribution Day'' cau be made a big
event.
Tne total cost of the group of calves
shall be averaged. A pure bred bull
of the same breed is bought i,t the
same time, and his cost prorated out
on the lorty or mors calves, added to
the average cost ol each call. All
calves shall Le mated to the sire owned
by the club.
Arrangements are made by the club
with one or more banks, a.il at the
bank if one's choice each (hild signs
a note lor one yeir lor the average to
tal cost ol his or her calf, with parent
(or guardian) as security. Banks,
cornercial clubs, farm clubs and farm
ureaus are in some cases financing
this plan. However, the regular in
terest rate is a small mitt.-r for such a
small sum for one year.
The club bylaws provide that at the
end of one year on 'Vail Club Sale
Day" (another big day) all calves are
to be auctioned c f!. All money above
amount of note goes to the child who
fed the calf. The bull is to be
auctioned also, and one-fortieth (or
one share) shall be laid to each club
member. Club holds meetings at
least once every eiht weeks to dis
cuss feeds and other agricultural
questions.
Prizes of 815, $10 and $5 for calf
in best sale cot.dition is offered by
I banks, commercial or ether clubs, or
individuals. Calves are judged by a
