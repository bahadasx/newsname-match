Big Time Planned
For State Merchants
February 19 to 24 will be mer
chants' week In Portland. During
the first three days will be held the
eleventh annual convention of the
Oregon Retail Merchants' Association
which, aside from snappy business
meetings and comnetltlve talks on
business ;ondltlons by merchants and
lady visitors, will include original
entertainments, sight-seeing tours,
theatre parties, etc., to be provided
by the convention entertainment com
mittee. Reduced rates of a fare and one
third have been named on all rail
road lines in Oregon, Washington
and Idaho, and elaborate plans have
been made for a meeting of the mer
chants of Washington and Idaho on
February 22, 23 and 24, During
these three days style shows, stock
keeping and window-decorating ex
hibite.'pure food shows, etc., will be
staged for the benefit of visitors.
All merchants of the Pacific north
west are cordially invited to partici
pate in business and celebrations of
the week. It isn't necessary that a
merchant be a member of any par
ticular association, the fact of his
being a merchant giving full evidence
of his eligibility.
Prominent Men Head Committees.
Nathan Strauss of the firm of
Flelchner, Mayer & Co.. who distin
guished himself as a director of the
Buyers' Week excursion to Portland,
is chairman of the committee of man
ufacturers and sales managers who
will have in charge the entertain
ments of the week. The experience
of Mr. Strauss in affairs of this kind
is assurance that the entertainment
will excel any that has been ever
given before In Portland.
O. Clifford Barlow, president of
the Oregon Retail Merchants' Asso
ciation, has appointed a committee
of retailers to assist In the program.
Everything of a dry nature will be
eliminated from the convention ses
sions. Snappy business talks and
progressive debates on business top
ics, together with demonstrations of
the latest business methods, Is" bound
to keep all In attendance on their
toes.
Every individual firm In Portland
will constitute a member of the en
tertainment committee, and the cour
tesies to be arranged will be Innum
erable. The last day for the use of return
tickets Is February 27. In addition
to providing a week of recreation
and pleasure, the convention and
congress will give dealers of every
community a chance to become ac
quainted with better methods of do
ing business and with the up-to-date
expedients which are being carried
on successfully by the city retailers.
Heavy Snows Put
Down Power Lines
'The heavy snows put down both
the Prospect and Fall Creek power
lines ol the California-Oregon com
pany yesterday morning at about the
same hour and threw the lighting
and heating of tho entire valley upon
the Gold Ray plant. Ashland had no
street lights last night and heating
current was reduced, hut this city
suffered little owing to the municipal
plant, which for a while yesterday
handled the whole city. At 10:30
o'clock last night the Fall creek line
over the Siskiyous was put In shape
again, but owing to the fact that the
plant over there 1b loaded down to
the limit, It aided the valley situa
tion but little. The trouble crews on
the Prospect linos had failed to lo
cate the troublo this morning, but
expect to have It found and fixed by
night. There Is three feet of snow
at Prospect.

Elks Make Children
. Of Ashland Happy
Nearly six hundred children of
Ashland were made happy at the Vln
Jng theatre Christmas afternoon and
evening by the Elks of Ashland. A
gift and bag of candy were distribut
ed from a wondorful tree by a big:
fat, jolly Santa Claus. A short pro
gram and the motion pictures round
ed out the event.
The Borgmann Shoe Company of
Portland is enlargisg its output and
has added a waterproofing shoe oil to
its line of products.
Milkmen Feel High
Cost of Living
As may bo gleaned from an an
nouncement elsewhere In this Issue,
the milkmen of Ashland have been
hit by the high cost of living. It
seems thnt the high cost of living
piles to cows as well as humans and
it is costing more to produce milk to -
day than ever before. The milkmen,
or those represented on the price an
nouncement, do not make extensive
raises in pricoB, but have brought all
prices to an equal plane. The only
rise of consequence is that in the
price for tickets in quantities. One
pint less for a dollar is the new rul

Ashland Homes See Many Happy
Xmas Gatherings of Friends and Kin
Ashland had one of the happiest
'and most perfect ChrMmases of all
time. There is little want In Ash-!
ap-Uand, and this Is all banished by the
J all-pervading Christmas spirit which
i turns this one day at least Into a
happy one for rich and poor alike.
What is more beautiful for
I Christmas setting than pure white
'fleecy snow, enveloping the trees and
shrubs and carpeting the rounded
hills and mountains which encircle
Ashland? Truly one feels the spell
of the fairy's wand and it is a joy
with such environment to believe In
Santa Claus.
A few of the scores of happy
Christmas home gatherings follow:
Among the long list of hosts and
hosteiises on Christmas day were Mr.
and Mrs. Otto Wlnte of the Boule
vard. The artistic skill of the gifted
hostess and her sisters transformed
the happy Winter home into verita
ble bowers of green and red; the
doors and windows were garlanded
in fir; a huge Christmas tree pleased
the eye us each guest entered the
drawing room. The dining table was
perfect In appointment with its mam
moth centerpiece of choice fruits out
lined in Oregon grape on the snow

friends. Their fortunate guests were
the Fred Wagner family, including
Mrs. Case, the mother of Mrs. Wag
ner, and the Davenhllls. In an at
mosphere of such true friendship,
character buds and blossoms and
pure happiness is found; but our
readers must not Imagine there was
any lack of creature comfort or
Christmas cheer In the McCoy house
hold. Mr. Charles B. Wolf and Mrs. Wolf
gathered the Whited family about
their festal board. Good wit, good
will and good things to eat in almost
unsurmountable quantities were
there.

complete. As a near echo of Christ-
mas hospitality one of Ashland s
I most charming young matrons, Mrs.

j informal breakfast Tuesday morning
with the Mfcsos Hansen of Medford
as honor guests. Tho breakfast table
was a dream.

(with Mesdames Harold II. Millican
and E. L. Jack as chaperones), en
tertained her Sunday school class of
bright, young girls most .gleefully
Thursday afternoon, the 28th, and

peep Into the future through the in
strumentality of the wonderful men

A Community Celebration.
Although attenuated In the matter
of numbers but whole-souled in the
sense of a joyous celebration of the
claims of old Father Xruns, the gath
ering in evidence at the residence of
Mr. H. G. Gllmore, 283 Scenic Drive,
on Monday last when the united fami
lies of Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Dill, Miss
Amy Ramsey and Mr. Thomas Hud
son with the Gllmore clan thrown
in as a sort of balance wheel was an
occasion of family rejoicing and right
good fellowship not soon to be for
gotten by half a dozen of Ashland's
convivial souls. The Gllmore home
was made doubly attractive by skill
ful decorations with a view to the
beautiful and symbolic In art, at
Chrlstmaatlde, while the festive board
literally groaned (as Dickens would
say were he In the flesh) with the
creature comforts and delicacies suit
ed to the gastronomic capabilities of
half a dozen woll-nourishod and well-
proportioned devotees of the culinary
department. To Mr. Hudson was
committed the task of dissecting into
sundry highways and byways a tur
key as tender and succulent as any of
the many that have been brought to
town this season. It may be stated
lihat, in an atmosphere of so much
geniality, it was, emphatically, an oc
casion of that happy blonding of the
feast of reason and the flow of soul
that has brought so much Inspiration
and loving kindness to the family
home circle.

Commercial Club
Has Money Ahead
For the first time in many years
the Commercial Club has every debt
paid up and over $100 In the bank.
The trustees of the club met Tuesday
night and passed the month's bills
and found when the month's account
was balanced up that a neat little
balance was on hand to put by for
future needs. The trustees are work
ing on several important projects and
hope to have something definite lined
up before long. There will be no
meeting of the club In January owing
to the fact that the regular meeting
night falls on New Year's.

This Thursday evening the Vining
attraction is William S. Hart, the
most noted portrayer of western
roles, but this time In a new and
even more likeable role. Hart takes
the character of a patriot who has
fought for his country and loves it
undevlatingly. He suffers the loss of
his gold claim through a flaw In the
law and can get no help at Washing
ton from the country he fought for.
His boy dies and the shock partly un

gade. A contact with a motherless
lad brings him back to his old self
and he saves his fellow countrymen.

Millions Found
In Dead Letters
More than two and a quarter mil
lion dollars worth of checks, drafts,
money orders and other valuable pa
pers were found in undeliverable let
ters by the dead letter office at
Washington during the last year, and
practically all were restored to their
I owners. First Assistant Postmaster
.General Daniel C. Ropor in his an
nual report announces that the dead
I letter division handled 10,839,890
; letters aud parcels during the year,
a slight lncreaso over the previous
year. One-third of these letters and'
parcels, or 3,677,194, was delivered;
101,485 contained things of valua
without, clew to their senders and
were held for claimants; 7,019,436
had to be destroyed and 41,775 were
still being investigated.
In ad'liiion to the valuable papers,
with a face value of $2,303,119,
found In undeliverable letters, many
contained stamps and some currency
was found loose In the malls. The
stamps and curroncy unclaimed, to
gether with proceeds from the sale of
articles of merchandise removed from
undoliventblo letters, aggregated
$53,665, and $11,000 was realized
from six months' operation of a new
postal regulation requiring collection
of 1 cent on advertised letters, mak
ing the total net revenue $64,665.
Mr. Roper says that the revenue esti
mated under the present condition
for a year would be approximately
$75,000, which would make the dead
letter division self-sustaining.
To prevent the unnecessary ac
cumulation of letters containing val
uable enclosures, a provision was
contained in the last postal appropri
ation law reducing tho limit of tima
that such letters shall be held await
ing reclamation from four years tc
two years.
On account of the large growth in
the parcel post business, experience
has demonstrated that the accumu
lation of this matter at tne points
designated for handling uead parcels
hns become so large as to make it
; difficult to find space for its accom
modation. Regulations provide, in
the case of insured parcels, that
claims for Indomnity must be filed
within six months, and it has been
found there is very little call for lost
parcels after the lapse of that time.
Accordingly, an order will be issued
amending the regulations so as to
reduce the time for holding such par
cels prior to sale from twelve months
to six months. Last year 395,161
parcels were found undeliverable.
Dead mall received by tho division
of dead letters during the year con
tained 677,700 misdirected letters.
115,766 unnddressed letters, 228,700
letters held for postage. 440,200 let
ters written on hotel paper by per
sons unknown to the hotels, and
104,700 letters bearing fictitious sig
natures. Horse at Play
Killed by Electricity
A valuable draft horse belonging
to Fred Putnam lost its life by elec
trocution in a most extraordinary
manner on Christmas day. The ani
mal, which was one of a team which
Mr. Putnam recently refused $400
for, was romping in the barn lot In
the snow with its mate, and from all
indications must have reared up and
caught his mouth on a low hanging
wire which formerly furnished cur
rent to the barn. The wire hooked
in the horse's upper teeth and in his
struggles he wore through the insula
tion and was killed by the 120-volt
current. He was found with the wiro
still hooked in his tooth. Electricians
state that a horse Is killed by a light
current f.nd that the fact that he got
It through his mouth was almost sure
to cause death. The wire was nine
feet from tho ground. The barn was
formerly used by the Hotel Oregon
and was electrically lighted when
they used it. One wire had been con
nected. The barn Is located on the
Allan Davis, property on First street
and Mr. Putnam had leased It. Tho
horse was one of s beautifully match
ed team and was valued at over
$2.50.
