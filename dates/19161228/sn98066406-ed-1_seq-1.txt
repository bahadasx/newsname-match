M. P. Church Notes
Kiev. F. L. Ckandkll, Pastor.
The Christmas tide has come and
gone again, and we feel Just a touch of
sadness as we realize this year is so
near its close. To some it has brought
largely of joy and happiness, while to
others sorrow, pain and disappoint
ment, but we know a great God rules
over all and have faith to believe that
some day we will understand. So let
us bow our heads as we say "Thy will
be done," and look ahead to the new
year as it stretches ahead of us. Its
pages are all clean. Let us fill them
with records of kindness, cheer, charity,
sympathy and the "Peace on Earth,
Good Will Toward Men" spirit of which
we have leen Einging. The past is
gone but the future is ours to make of
it what we will. Let us prove our
selves men and women indeed, and
make this coming year bigger and bet
ter than any preceding it. We know of
no better way to prepare for it than by
hearing our pastor's new year address
on Sunday evening next entitled "The
Four-fold Man."
Our pastor and his wife wish to ex
press their thanks to all who so kindly
remembered them at Christmas time.
The L. A. S. was entertained last
Wedneseay afternoon by Mrs. Charles

We will be glad to welcome you at

The Cantata given on Christmas

out the program. All who were pres
ent speak highly of their work.

THE BEST YET.
One of the greatest events in the his
tory of the motion picture art will take
place at Princess Theatre on Monday,
Jan. 1, afternoon and evening, when
Russia's dancer, Anna Pay Iowa, will
appear on he screen in a massive spec
tacle entitled "The Dumb Girl of
Portici."
"Who is the greatest box ollice at
traction in the world?" This is a query
one may hear at every hand, not only
where stage folk congregate, but in
the clubs and the foyers of the theaters
and opera house. The general impres
sion is that the great singers and great
opera make the biggest box office, at
tractions, but aside from Caruso there
is not one singer of either Bex who
would fill the Metropolitan Opera
House at 65.00 a seat or higher without
the aid of other famous names. Un
questionably, the only celebrity in the
world who could pack the opera house
at 95.00 a 6eat through her own per
sonality is Anna Pavlowa, who has
drawn $10,000 in one night, and in one
evening at the Metropolitan Opera
House so frequently, that the box office
executives could always predict within
a fraction what the gross results would
be.
Pavlowa drew $17,000 in two per
formances in Los Angeles, Cal., while
during the week afterwards the Metro
politan Opera House Company, includ
ing all of the world's greatest singers
combined as the attraction, could not
attract the equal average at the box
oflice. Therefore, the public which is
now privileged to see Pavlowa in
massive film spectacle at the price of
admission vastly below any she has
ever appeared, may congratulate itself
on the wonderful development of the
motion picture art, which is now beck
oning the world's greatest artists in
the direction of a film studio.
Afternoon show begins at 2 o'clock.
Admission, children 15c; adults 25c.
Evening show begins at 7 o'clock. Ad
mission, all seats, 25c. ,
December Weddings
The farm home of Mr. and Mrs. Levi
Donnenworth was the soene of a very

Holt. The ceremony was performed

Mich., brother of the bride, in the pres
ence of only the immediate relatives

cousin of the groom, was bridesmaid
and Mr. Kawley Ilallman, cousin of the
bride, acted as groomsman.
After the ceremony a sumptuous wed
ing dinner was served, soon after which
the happy couple left on a thort wed
ing tour to Detroit and other points.
