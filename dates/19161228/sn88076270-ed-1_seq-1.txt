Expect Severest Test For England

Spring—lers»an Position
Pari*, Dec. 26.—In addresses at the
National Congress of the French so
cialist party, Sir Arthur Henderson,
the British cabinet minister, and G.
H. Roberts, member of the British
Bliuslastic
arliament,
both
affirmed, amidst en-
cheers, that the war inust
be fought out until full guarantees
had been
obtained
for a lifting peace.
"In my opinion," Mr. Henderson
said, "if France and ourselves were
to enter into negotiations under ex
isting conditions we should be nations
in bondage. Nothing less than that
is the price our enemies woiild exact
for peace today."
Emile Vandervolde, the Belgian So
cialist leader, said:
"Our comrades who have remain
ed in invaded Belgium endured 'Ger
man dominion with admirable firm
ness. Nothing but encouragement
reaches us from them. So that it
would seem that the persons most
hostile to war are those farthest from
it/'
In his speech, Mr. Henderson said
"In my opinion, we have now
reached the most dangerous and dif
ficult period of the war. During the
next few months the democracies of
England and France are going to be
tested as never before. Do not mis
understand me. I do not m®iip that
the stress and strain of i:ghting in
the field will be more severe, al
though I do not ignore such a pos
sibility. But the danger is of en
tirely a different character

cedented sacrifices, our horror of war,
our love of peace, may lead us to

negative action against material
forces which are highly organized,
but we are engaged in a great spirit
nal conflict upon the results of which
depend all our great ideals. If we en
ter into negotiations now we do so
when Germany is not repentant for
her wrong doings and is glorifying
in the success of her military efforts,
in fact, in the victory of German im
perialism.
I'T^e choice today is between an
peace, with years of fear
untimely, ^onths of suffering, and

From Berlin
Berlin, bv wireless to Sayville, Dec.
26.—The text of Germany's answer
to President Wilson's
note
was trans­
mitted today by James W. Gerard,
the American ambassador.
The answer which also contains the
reply of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded suggestions made
bv the president of the United States
of America in order to create a basis
for the establishment of a lasting
peace have been received and consid
ered by the imperial government in
the friendly spirit which was ex
pressed in the president's communi
cation.
"The president points out that
which he has at heart and leaves open
the choice of road.
"To the imperial government an
immediate exchange of views seems
to be the most appropriate road
order to reach the desired result.
"It begs, therefore, in the sense
of the declaration made
on
Septem­
ber 12 which offered a hand for peace
negotiations to propose an immedi
ate conference of delegates of tne
belligerents, at a neutral place.
"The imperial government also is
of the opinion that the great work of
preventing further wars can be be
gun only after the end of the present
struggle of nations."

"The official reply cannot state

will demand reorganization of Aus-

which form the first step of their
progress for world power. Diplomacy
cannot suggest these terms until the
allies have laid the firm foundation

would acknowledge a result of the

"Flatiron" Building
Destroyed At Minot
Daily News and Many Other Concerns
Suffer Great Losses—'Total Put
At $100,000
Minot, Dec. 22.—A fire which start
ed from a gasoline explosion when
John Beckman attempted to light the
coffee boiler in the Calumet restaur
ant at 4:30 a. m. yesterday, complete
ly gutted the Flatiron building, lo
cated on Central avenue at the south
end of the viaduct, causing a prop
ertay damage of $100,000, with a
probable insurance of $60,000 and put
ting the plant of the Daily News out
of commission and inflicting a loss
impossible to determine at this time
.on the paper. A number of families
who were living in the flats which
were located on the upper story of the
building were left homeless and all of
them were forced to flee in forty de
grees below zero weather in their
night clothes.
When Mr. Beckman turned on the
gasoline to start the generator in
the coffee boiler, it is evident he al
lowed more than the required quan
tity of gasoline to escape and the
holder into which the gasoline is burn
ed to develop the gas, overflowed and
ran over the shell upon which the
boiler was located and onto the floor
underneath. When he touched a
match to the gasoline the entire
quantity of spilled fluid instantly
caught fire, wrapping the room in
flames.
The building was owned by W. M.
Smart and was worth $20,000, on
which he had $9,000 insurance. It
was 105 feet long on Central avenue
and 35 feet deep at the east end,
tapering to almost a point at the
west end. It was erected abo.it three
years ago. It was of brick. The up
per floor besides having a number of
apartments, was occupied by Jour
gen Olson Co., investment bankers,
Johnson & Sheets, attorneys, and W.
M. .Smart.
The street floor was occ ipied
Fr"d Howard, who operated a barber
shop in the west room of the build
ing D. C. Mitchell, who had a con
fectionery the business office of the
Daily News, the Calumet restaurant,
where the fire originated, and the
Myers jewelry store and F. J. Reko,
musical instruments.
The first sub-street story was prac
tically all occupied by thr- mechani
cal and editorial departments of the
Daily News, tht stock rooms of the
papt-r, including the job department.

WASTE FROM HIE

HIGH PER CENT OF PREVENT
ABLE LOSSES PROVES NEED
OF "SAFETY FIRST"
Figures to prove that at least one
half of the fire losses in the state last
year could have been prevented, and
were therefore pure waste, gives rise
to the question as to whether prop
erty owners and the general public
are, right now at the most dangerous
season, exercising tie ordinary pre
caution against fires that goes with
the policy of safety first.
Of all fires in North Dakota dur
ing 1915, 32.2 were wholly prevent
able, and 41.2 per cent were partly
Sres
xeventable, while 25.3 per cent of
had their origin in unknown
causes.

nesota, which had 25 per cent wholly

that the North Dakota situation is
about the same as in the neighboring
states*
The percentages are worked out by
the actual bureau of the national
board of fire underwriters, copies of
the statement prepared by the bureau
being received in Fargo today.
Total fire losses in North Dakota
from wholly preventable fires were

DAKOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1916.
ADVOCATES PLANTS
OH MISSOURI
POINTS ON OLD MUDDY LOGI
CAL FOR STATE ELEVATORS
AND OTHER PLANTS
Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 22.—The pro
posed terminal elevator and the state
owned packing plant should be lo
cated on the Missouri river, at the
Bismarck and Mandan side, respec
tively, in the opinion of John Blood
good of New Salem, who says:
"The terminal elevator recently
dedicated by the Society of Equity
will be
a
great help to the city of
and
it is
state of Minnesota. But
not
fair for North Dakota pro­
to
go in with the money they
from
North Dakota farms and
build up St. Paul and Minnesota.
Rather, they should build up North
Dakota
and
our own cities.
"I have lived in Morton county 33
years. I am 68 years old and I am.
not looking for anything for myself.
But for the good of the state of which
I think so much, I ask, 'Why not
build terminal elevators and £tate
packing plants here in our own
state?' Surely no state has a better
right to such plants. This state has
everything within her own .boundar
ies to ju«tify the building of such en
terprises. And a start should be
made this winter.
Question of a Site
"An important question is that of
a proper site. I will suggest as the
logical location for a state terminal
elevator the Missouri river landing
on the Bismarck side, and for a state
packing plant the Missouri river land
ing on the Mandan side. First, be
cause these locations are nearly in

of the state second, be­
the
selection of the sites named
would place these important enter
prises upor* one of the greatest rivers
in
world, a stream which soon
must become one of the northwest's
greatest arteries of commence. This
will mean an opportunity for the
producers of all the northwest to ship
their grain, livestock, dressed meats,
every product of the farm, from Man
dan and Bismarck by an all-water
route to Europe, via New Orleans,
with but one transfer. Think of this
saving in transportation and of sill
the middle men's profits which would
be
eliminated! And then consider
the
hundreds of cities this route
would bring us as a market for our
produce. North Dakota railroads
would be compelled to meet river
competition if the plants were lo
cated here, and we could do away
with our railroad commissioners—
the river would be the best regulator
'of rates.
River Route Feasible
"Friends of the railroads will tell
you
that the river route will never
work
that river transportation has
been
going backward for the last fifty
years,
and this
is
all true. But thev
may not tell you the real cause, which
is
that the legislatures of every state
in
thevUnion except New York have
assisted the railroads in killing the
canals
and river transportation. But
now
the order of things has changed,
and peop.' £"e
comin?
once
in­
to their own.
"If our government in the last fifty
years had stood by its rivers and built
canals instead of spending millions in
fighting the railroads and pleasing
political pork seekers by dumping
millions into worthless creeks, we
would now be in ft position where
transportation tariffs would adjust
themselves without any tinkering up
on the part of the interstate com
merce commission or local boards.
And I trust that as a means of ad
vancing the development of our zre&t
river and of furthering the progress
of
the entire state, our new adminis
tration will work for enterprises
within the state of North Dakota to
the complete exclusion of anything
outside the state."

It is now stated that nothing defi
nite is known of the time when *he

Organizes Relief
Work In Montana
Dr. David Lavs Foundation For Worl
of Collecting Funds For Syrian
Sufferers
Dr. T. H. David
has just returned
from a trip to several of the
prin­
cipal cities of Montana, including
Havre, Great Falls, Butte, Joplinand
Chinook, where in connection
with
others, he laid the foundation for a
campaign for funds for the relief of
the suffering Syrians and Armenians.
As secretary of the North Dakota
Syrian Relief Committee, Doctor Da
vid from his headquarters in Wil
liston has during the past several
months carried on a successful relief
campaign in North Dakota.
Montana has a larger Syrian pop
ulation than North Dakota and, with
its high degree of prosperity, brought
about by a bumper wheat crop, is
in a position to contribute generously
to this urgent call for help. Doctor
David carried with him to Montana
credentials to prove his authority to
engage in the work and his reputa
tion for integrity, signed by several
prominent Williston officials and by
Governor Hanna. The doctor met
with an encouraging spirit of co-op
eration at the hands of the press and
of individuals. The Great Falls Tri
bune publishes the story of a meeting
in that city at which an organization
for relief work was effected with Mr.
David as chairman. The work as con
templated in preliminary plans, will
include tag days, illustrated lectures
on Syria, and public subscriptions.
Prominent people in each city will be
interested in the work.
After the campaign in Montana,
Doctor David, who is deeply concern
ed over the plight
of
the
people in
his
native country, expects to assist with
campaigns in several other Mountain
and Coast states. He is devoting his
time to the work without compensa
tion.

The War Causes It—
New Peace Argument
Something must be done and that
before very long. The food specula
tors must be ferretted out and pro
secuted, the European war must be
stopped, production., must be increas
ed, or else a crimp put in prosperity
in order that consumption may be
reduced—most anything to bring the
high cost of living down within the
reach of the average young man.
The matter is really becoming se
rious. The fact was disclosed here
this week by Judge Butler that there
is a direct relation between the II. C.
L. and the dreaded tendency toward
race suicide. Here are the cold stub
born figures:
Marriage licenses issued in 1915—
162^
Marriage licenses issued in 1916—
144.
In spite of prosperous times ana
increasing population, in spite of the
fact that a marriage license is one
of the few things that has not gor.e
up in price but can still be obtained
for a bushel and a half of whe it or
two bushels of potatoes, and further,
in spite of the fact that 1916 was
leap year, there has been an actual
falling off in the volume of matri
monial business of eleven per cent.
This is something of vital interest
to ministers, justices of the peace,
probate judges, furniture dealers,
grocers and landlords. Something
will certainly have to be done. Per
haps the legislature can be induced
to start an investigation possioly
the matter can be put under the su
pervision of the supreme court.
Not only was there a falling off in
the total number of marriage licenses
in 1916 as compared with the num
ber in 1915, but there were no tem
porary spurts to equal the speed rec
ord of November 1915 when 26 li
censes were issued. October 1916
made a creditable attempt to equal
that record when 24 men took vows
to love, cherish, and build the kitchen
fire for partners who promised to
love, honor and (sometimes) obey
and to keep the buttons sewed on.
An upward tendency in matrimon
ial stock is indicated by last weeks
record of ten licenses.
