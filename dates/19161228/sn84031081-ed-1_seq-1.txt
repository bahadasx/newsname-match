nuinv in seeking an immediate

German Policy Outlined.
The German policy upon which the
reply to President Wilson's communi
cation is based was outlined as fol
lows: "Germany feels that the conference
suggested by it first should be com
posed of delegates from the belliger
ent countries, whose duty it would be
to settle territorial terms. Once these
terms are agreed upon, representa
tives of the neutrals should be called
in to participate in consideration of
the questions of guarantees for the fu
ture, in which neutrals are as vitally
concerned as belligerents. These

of arbitration.

While there were no official advices
upon the subject, the view still per
sisted in German quarters tonight
that the noe of the central
powers might he followed by s"me
highly confidential oral or written
communication to President Wilson,
In which at least broad tentative terms

cussed the peace situation with him.

Commenting on the German rTly
to President Wilson's note, the Lokal
Anzeiger of Berlin says:
"From the fact that Germany has
not allowed the Christmas festival to
pass without replying to President
Wilson's note, not even our enemies
must gain the conviction that we
made the peace offer seriously. Should
Mr. Wilson be induced by our note to
recommend to our enemies that they
send representatives to a neutral place
for the purpose of peace negotiations,
we should still be far from abandon
ing ourselves to the hope that the
move would meet with success at Lon
don. Paris. Petrograd and Home."
The Tagliche Rundschau of Berlin
says:
"Our government's announcement
of its desire to bring about an end
of the conflict with our enemies in
personal negotiations Without the co-

operation of neutrals Is very satisfac

that we will decline decisively the in
terference of non-purth ipnnts in the
fighting and in the creation of peace."
The Vossische Zeitung, referring to
the Swiss note, .says:
"If further neutral notes are
couched in similar tone they certainly
will find a sympathetic understanding
among us. The Swiss note hrenthes
the honesty of that true neutrality
which has characterized Switzerland
during the entire war."

The newspapers continue to discuss
President Wilson's note to the bellig
erents uh an important diplomatic
event. The Giornale d'ltalla suggests
that the allies should treat it precisely
as President Lincoln did In rejecting
France's effort to intervene in the
American civil war.
"If the dead of Gettysburg inspired
President Lincoln's respect," says the
newspaper, "so our dead of the Tren
tino must inspire Huron Sonnino's an
