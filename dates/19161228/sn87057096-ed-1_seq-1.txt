BIG FIRE AT OSCEOLA
Northeast Corner of Square at Os
ceola Destroyed by Disastrous
Fire Thursday Morning.
About 2 o'clock last night Marshal
Bggleston and Dale Paschall discov
ered a fire in the basement under
Bond's jewelry store and London &
Boehmes drug store. The alarqk^was
sounded and chief Moyers ana his
men responded as quickly as the fire
department could be put in operation
under the unfavorable weather con
ditions. But when the fire lighters
were prepared to make the attack
the interior of the buildings mention
ed were wrapped in flames to such
an extent that it seemed for a while
that the entire block might be de
stroyed.
Hundreds of people gathered in
the vicinity of the burning buildings
and stood shivering in the frigid at
mosphere ready to do what they
could to assist in fighting the flames.
The records of the post office were
taken from the building. The stock
and fixtures of Alfred Fluke's shoe
store were piled on the side walk.
But the firemen made such splen
did progress that it was soon appar
ent that they would be able to put
the flames under control. There
wag- a good supply of water in the
tank and reservoir and the pumping
plant was able to keep up all the
pressure reauired. The greatest
difficulty was encountered by the
fact that some scoundrel had stolen
tiie best hose nozzles from the fire
house. By three
an(j
O'CIOCK
it was evi­
dent that the post office, Fluke's
shoe, store, the restaurant and the
barber shoo would be saved, though
considerablely damaged by smoke
As nearly as could be learned by
the facts gathered hurriedly this
morning, among the heavy losses are
U. S. Bond & Bro.'s jewelry stock
estimated vaiue $15,000, insurance
12,000 London & Boehme's drug
store, valued at $6,000, insurance
|3f500 Smith & Ray Grocery, valu
ed at |5,000, insurance 92,000 Bev
ans 4b West'restaurant, valued at
|3,00€. insurance fl,000.
.Alfred Fluke'B loss will be heavy
—not so much bv the fire and water
as by the fact that his stock and
fixtures were badly damaged by bet
ing hurriedly removed. \Ve were
advised that he had a light insur
ance.
The fixtures of the barber shop
were saved, but somewhat damaged
by being removed.
The post office fixtures and the
big Christmas mall were saved but
all were injured by smoke and water.
The office will be opened and the
mail distributed this afternoon. The
carriers did not make their routes
today but it is thought that the of-'
flee service will be re-established this,
afternoon..
It is probable that steps will, be
Men at onee to reconstruct the?
burned district. It is a hard blow,
to the business firms who sustained
the losses as well as to Dr. Boli
baugh who owns the buildings.

Volunteer Fire Department for the
efficient service they rendered under

HOW TO SAVE COAT
Get (Greater Efficiency and Heat, from
Your Coal—Follow These
Instructions.
Does your coal burn too fast? Are
you consuming more than you think
you ought to? Let me tell you how
to get greater efficiency and increas
ed heat.
First. Wet your coal good once
every week. feecond. YVhen your
fire is burning nicely shovel ashes to
the center of tlie fire in such a way
as to make the fire burn from the
outside next to the fire pot. This will
make some clinker but what do you
care if ft does if you increase ilie ef
ficiency of the fuel burned by 23 per
cent.
You will have clinkers because
they ere the result of the intense
heat fusing the ashes into one solid
mass and, that is also the reason
that the coal that made no clinker in
inild weather clinkers in extremely
cold weather. When you have an ex
tremely hot fire try this.

Trouble Threatened at Cory
don Over
"Come to Church" Sign.
The Twelve Apostles of Leon wtto
were recently stung by the smooth
sign man, LeonarcT Fowler, who
.cleaned up a small fortune by erect
ing "Come to Church" signB all over
Howa, may get some consolation from
the. thought that there are others.
Out at Corning last Hreek the Free
Press wrote up the schemet saying
tl&t in order to forget about it, the
signers all paid up at once. Over at
Corydon there is some trouble as will
be seen from the following taken
from last week's Times-Republican:
Considerable trouble is threatened
over the big electric "Come to
Church" Bign which was to be placed
on one of the prominent buildings of
Corydon. It seems that a number of
citizens and buftiness men of Corydon
contracted to pay 5 cents, per day
for a period of three years to com
pensate the sign company for placing
and maintaining a big sign in Cory
don. This occurred last summer,
but the sign has never been erected
as none or the landlords of suitable
buildings seemed willing to permit
having it placed on the roof of (lis
building.
Now some of the local men who
contracted with the sign company are
said to be anxious to have the con
tract cancelled and this the sign
company does not propose to do.
Overland Girls.
One of the big attractions coming
to the Leon opera house Saturday,

Horse Kicks Axe Into Leroy Man's
-. Ffcee.
Sanford Exlfty met. With a serious
accident last, week when he and his
man went for a load-of wood. It
seems one of the horses was hanging
back and net puuing.his shgre and
Mr,. Exley got olf the wagon and
went up to the slew horse and gave
it a lick With' the flat side of his
axe which was a double' bitted one.
Thie horse lUnged.forward and
at
the
same time kicked with'both its feet,
one hoof striking the axe in such a
way as to drive it backward With
great force into Mr. Exley's face.
The sharp
naTt
of the axe cut his
face from tne top of the eye to the
lower Up going through to the roof
of his mouth. Mr. Exley was hur
ried to his home a distance of mile
and medical aid was summoned and
the wound dressed, it being neces
sary to take ten stitches to close the
wound. It was a very close call.
However, he is doing as well as
could be expected, being about fifty
years of age.—Garden Grove Ex

A Big Change at Hansell's.
A big change is taking jlace at
Hansell this week.
the bit department store-of Frank N.
this week. Mr. S. E. Bene
flel of this city ha& purchased a part
of the Hansell stock, and a partition
is being built to divide the double
store room, with an arch between so
that the two stores will be connect
ed. Mr. Benefiel will run the north
room as an up-to-date variety store,
taking the line of men's wear, tne
five and ten cent counters and a'll
racket goods, and he will at once
greatly enlarge, this stock so that it
will be a real variety store and one
which will be a credit to Leon. There
has been a demand" for this kind of a
store in Leon, and Mr. Hansell's
growing business in the dry goods,
shoes and ladles' wear has grown
until he could no longer care for the
other lines. He will now devote all
his time and energy strictly to the
drv goods, shoes and ladies' wear
lines, and you can look for him to
have one of the best stores of this
kind in the state.

Hud Davis Dead
G.
D. Davis, one of our most
prominent and successful business
men, died at the family home in the
east part of town Tuesday morning
at 9:30 after a comparatively brief
illness.
He was out last Friday night and
was found by the family Saturday
morning sitting on a lawn swing on
the porch of their residence in a
very serious condition. He was put
to bed by the family and a physician
summoned who found that Mr. Davis
was sunering from an injury to his
head, the indications being that he
had fallen, or in some other way had
sustained a fractured skull. His feet
were also badly frozen, but death re
sulted from the injury to his head
and not from the effects of the freez
ing.
Funeral services were held from
the Baptist church yesterday after
noon conducted by Rev. J. H. Bur
rows, assisted by Rev. R. L. Wood,
after which interment was made in
Oakland cemetery.
He leaves a wife, son and a num
ber of relatives and host of friends
who will sincerely regret his un
timely death. The sincere sympathy
of the entire community goes out to
the bereaved ones.
We hoped to have an appropriate
obituary for our next issue.—Caines
