Laredo, Tex., December 10.
Quite a movement was made
here by the troops last week, we
were out four days hiking and
butting through the cactus and
over the hill sides. Our first day
out we hiked to Santa Rosa
Ranch, which is fifteen miles.
Taking up our hike the next
morning we camped at DeLores
Creek, 27 miles from Laredo. On
our return the sham fight took
place between DeLores Creek
and Santa Rosa, the Fourth
Regiment forming the tiring
line. The next engagement was
between Santa Rosa and Laredo,
the Second Regiment doing the
fighting. Our enemies were the
Third U. S. Field Artillery and
the Second Florida Infantry.
The four days was well spent in
maneuvering, but was quite a
hardship on the boys, us the
weather was very cool at nights.
It was impossible to keep warm.
The water we had for our first
day's drinking was from
DeLores Creek, the alkali water
being so salty we couldn't use it
for 10 days, and we had no water
during all of one day, Upon our
return squads of Florida boys
could be noticed along the road
side, almost completely played
out. Tho Orange Juice boys can't
stand the test. A remark was
iieard from the post hospital
about them which stated that out
of the 1,200 there must have
been 800 of them reported for
treatment.
The Fourth Regiment will be
the last of the Missouri troops
to leave the border. The Sec
ond Missouri Field Hospital and
Ambulance Companies are
ordered home and will leave us
soon.
Our ball team won the pennant
of the Laredo district, the sea
son closing Sunday, they bring
ing in the silver cup. Our regi
mental band took part and
paraded the team through the
Regiment with the beautiful
silves cup in view. The boys of
the Fourth did the cheering.

spend Christmas with his

s.
AS the year 1916 approaches the end
and we glance back over its fruits
Joys and Sorrows, Sunshine and
Sadness, we are prone to fall into a philo
sophical mood and analyze the results and
reason out the "why" of the happenings of
Old 1916. The "Sadness and Sorrows are
to receive but scant consideration at this sea
son when the holiday spirit should permeat
all humankind. Rather, wc turn to the
blessings that have been ours in a measure
the blessing of being allowed to live; the
blessing of being allowed to meet almost daily
the best citizenship of the county and com
munity in which we reside. And it is to
the acts and encouragements of these "citizen
patrons" that we attribute our blessings
the blessings of a fairly prosperous year, a
year in which we have made many new
friends and cemented more firmly the "old
ones" whose patronage and many kind deeds
have banished the ghosts of business and
helped make smooth the pathway of 1916.
It is to these old friends and patrons that
we wish to extend our most sincere well
wishes for the New Year, and to the new
ones we extend the same greeting with the
assurance that during the year 1917 we will
use every honest enueavor to merit a contin
uance of that friendship, Wishing you all
a Happy and Prosperous New Year, we are
Very Respectfully

Negro Murdered
A negro was killed in the lim
its of Hayti Sunday morning at
about 4:30. We understand his
name was Temple. He was found
in the weeds to the rear of the
old Beeman Building, and is
supposed to have been killed by
Will White, another negro.
There was three shots fired by a
number 20 guage automatic
shotgun, one of the shots taking
effect, and which appears to have
caused sudden death.

practice certainly performed
well, and much credit is due
