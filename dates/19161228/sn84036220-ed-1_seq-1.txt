REPLY TO
GERMANY
England and France Are
Agreed on Terms to
Peace Proposals.
MAY GO THIS WEEK
Other Nations of the Entente, How
ever, Although Agreed in Principle,
May Require Verbal Alterations,
Which Would Necessitate Further
Delay—It Is Expected That Once
This Reply Has Been Forwarded
the Response to President Wilson's
Note Will Follow Shortly—Note
May Be Sent Last of This Week.
LONDON, Dec. 27.—(6:23 p. m.)—
England and France have fully agreed
upon terms of the reply to be made
to the peace proposals of the Teutonic
allies, the Associated Press learned at
the foreign office today. It is hoped
here the answer may be dispatched
by the end of this week, but other na
tions of the entente, although agreed
in principle, may require verbal alter
ations which would necessitate further
delay.
It is expected that once this reply
has been forwarded the response to
President Wilson's note will follow
shortly.
SOCIALISTS WANT WAR.
PARIS, Dec. 27.—(4:01 p. m.)—The
congress of French socialists today by
an almost unanimous vote adopted a
resolution requesting the entente al
lied governments to reply to Presi
dent Wilson's note concerning peace
by saying that they are ready to tell
him their conditions of peace, which
must include just reparation for the
wrongs done by the central empires.
The socialists also declare they were
for such a peace as was defined by the
international socialist congress in
London in February. 1915.
It was decided by the socialists of
the entente allied countries at the
Ixmdon conference that "no hope for
peace can be entertained until German
militarism is crushed."
Resolutions were passed urging that
Belgium he liberated and compen
sated, that.ths question, of Poland
should be 3etUed in accordance with
the wishes of the Polish people and
that "from Alsace-Lorraine to the Bal
kans those populations that have been
annexed by force shall receive the
right freely to dispose of themselves."
RESULTING IN GOOD.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.—In spite of
the wide gulf between the insistence
of the central powers for an immedi
ate peace conference and the forecast
of an unanimous refusal by the entente
allies to enter such a conference with
out knowing Germany's terms in ad
vance, the American government be
lieves that the negotiations in progress
are resulting in good. It was said
with authority tonight that until the
door to peace actually is closed by one
side or the other. President Wilson
will continue to hope that any discus
sion of the subject will tend to hasten
the end of the war.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, returning unexpectedly
tonight from New York, authorized the
Associated Press to make the follow
ing statement:
"I regard the note of my govern
ment as constituting an acceptance of
everything suggested by President
Wilson in his note to the belligerent
nations of Europe."
It was made clear at the embassy
that Germany stands ready to make
known her terms on the first day
of any conference that may be held,
and officials expressed themselves as
being greatly surprised at the view
prevailing in some quarters here that
the Berlin government had failed to
meet the president's suggestions by
not setting down in the reply the
terms upon which it is willing to make
peace. The German diplomats say
President Wilson had no intention of
drawing a public declaration concern
ing terms from the central powers. On
the contrary, they think, the presi

OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES IN U.S.
NEW YORK, Dec. 27 .—Adoption of
the metric system of weights and
measures tor commercial use In the
United States and also of the "day
light saving" plan was advocated to
day by speakers in different sections
of the convention of the American As

An unusual opportunity is afforded
at present to make the metric system

George F. Kuntz, president of the New

The demand for war materials, he
said, has forced the Introduction of

WILSON'S
FUNERAL I
LAST TRIBUTE WILL BE PAID TO
MEMORY OF WELL-KNOWN
OLD-TIMER TODAY.
am FROM THE CREEL CHAPEL
The funeral of the late "'Tug" Wil
son, who died at St. Joseph's hospital
Christmas day, will be held at Creel's
undertaking parlors this afternoon,
and many old-time friends of the range
will be in attendance to pay the last
tribute to his memory.
It is quite probable that not many
of the newer settlers in the country
knew Arthur Wilson, or "Tug," as he
was nearly always called. But in the
old days, when there were cattle by
thousands where are now the grain
fields of Fergus county, "Tug" was a
familiar figure on the roundups and
amongst the range men of those days.
He was one of the real old-time range
hands, the kind who knew brands and'
cattle as well ak does a certified ac -1
countant know figures. For more than
40 of the 58 years that he lived, Ar
thur Wilson's life was with the trail!
and roundup outfits of the ranges of
Nebraska, Colorado and Montana.
When the Bay States Cattle com
pany came to the Judith Basin in
1886, "Tug" Wilson came up with
them from Nebraska, and worked for
Tom McShane for a season or two.
Then he went over to the Two Bar
and worked under Tom Shaw for sev-,,
eral years. After that he worked for
; .he Bower outfit, and when there was
no more range and no more cattle he
took his little savings and located on
a small ranch on Chippewa creek, a
ew miles from Gilt Edge, where he
accumulated a nice bunch of cattle
and prospered in a modest way.
There is nothing peculiar or unusu
al in the fact that "Tug" Wilson is
dead; he merely paid the price of liv
ing. But in his passing it is fitting
to remember a man of his type. He
was not a genial man. He made few
close friendships. But in his heart
there did abide in plenteous abund
am o that blessed gift, charity.
No friend in distress ever appealed
to this man in vain, and no helpful
act of his was ever mentioned to an
other. Sheriff-elect John H. Steph-Lj
4.. snnxlritllT <xf him COW ' "II
ens, in speaking of him, said: "I
worked with old 'Tug' for several
years, and not in my life have I known
a man so generous in every way. To
help somebody seemed to be his pleas
ure in living." The writer has cause
to know of his kindness of heart, and
the gentleness that hid itself behind
that rather gruff exterior.
It may be that the long yea-s of,
service in the lonely places of the
range, combined with the vicissitudes
and hardships of such a life caused
this man to live within and depend
entirely upon himself, to reject rather
than to invite companionship, but not
any suffering, worry, danger or hard-,
ship ever dulled within him that read
iness to assist his fellow in need.
There are many of the old-time
friends who will regret to know that
Arthur Wilson is dead.

The end came last Friday at 9 p. in.

Born in Hamburg, Germany, some
6'J years ago, the decedent left Ills
home across the sea, being beckoned
to America by glowing accounts of
opportunities for the ambitious. He
resided in various sections of the
country, hut came west in the latter;
seventies, locating in the cattle coun
try of Montana. He was I'irut em-1
ployed by Trepp Bros, at their Mis
souri valley ranch, near Townsend,
and later rode on u number of round
ups in the Musselshell for tills firm,
looking after the oTo cattle. Meyer
was an expert horseman, and a fine
cow puncher. He followed this vo
cation exclusively until the last
years, when the settlement of the
country practically put him out of

business. Reluctantly he went to
farming, locating on a ranch near
Deerfield, where lie raised a little
stoek. At odd times lie continued
breaking horses, and was known as
an excellent bronco buster, being a
goodrider, as well as having the knowl
edge of that calling down to a fine
point.
A short while ago he disposed of
some of his livestock and personal
property, as well as his ranch, which
is located near the Theodore Hoge
land ranch. Being quite ill he came
to Lewistown to spend what he
thought would he his lust winter. Tlie
best of attention failed to prolong Iiis
life and the end came peacefully last
Friduy evening.
Tile deceased is survived by a broth
er and a sister, who live in California.
He was unmarried.
To take his chances witli a wild
and bucking broncho, or to have a tus
sel with some equally wild Montana
steer, was the work of Otto Meyer
lor years. He was a fearless rider,
a genial fellow, whoso friends were
numbered by legion. He was distinct
ly of the type of the fast disappearing
American cowboy, generous, gentle
manly like tlie rest, yet not free from
some of the faults common to the
majority of them. In recent years lie
became more frugal and settled down
to farm life to some extent. But his
nature called for the free life of tlie
cow puncher. However, he adapated
himself to the new order of tilings,
and spent his declining years in com
fort.
