The following wire story from Gilson Gardner gives the view
of the incident in Washington ano in congress —EOiTOR
WASHINGTON. D. C., Dec. 28.—Invasion ot the
privacy ot the mails in time <>t peace by army officers or
at the instigation of the army is just as criminal a per
formance as if such an art w ere performed by a com
mon highwayman.
This is the opinion of the postoffice department
officials, and it is this nspert of the trouble over tlv
seizure of the "round robin" sent by the Highlit Ohio
regiment that has stirred congress. It is the real reason
for Senator Pomerene's resolution demanding an inquiry.

"HIGHER-UPS"
ARE INVOLVED,
SAYS C. ALLEN
Logan Billingsley, the "brains" of the
bootleggers' ring in Seattle, today completed
his confession to United States District At
torney Clay Allen, which not only involves
him, his two brothers, the Jesse Hunt Moore
company of San Francisco, but also a num
ber of officials here.
"Billingsley talked freely and of his own
volition," Allen said today. "To what ex
tent he has involved others, I cannot say."
Billingsley, who is under several federal
indictments for violations of the interstate
act against liquor shipments into dry terri
tory, was closeted with Allen for three hours
late Wednesday.
lie was tben removed to th»
I'lfrin county Jail. being still un
a! le to furnish tin- lionds of I! !.■
M>o required of him.
At 11 o'clock thin morning, he
nan brought back to Seattle by
Hepuiv Marfbnl Fleetwood and im
mediately was taken to Allen's of
fice
lie f-mained there only five mih
tiles, and left tin* federal building
with Fleetwood.
I wa« reported that he may
have decided to induce hi* broth
er#. Fr«d and Ora. to tturrender.
He is to ba*e JttMhsr session
with Allen this afternoon.
While the lK>oks and records of
the Jesso Hunt Moore Co. show
that Hlllingsley jr had bought ap
proximately MO.ftOO of liquor,
r hich stretched" with water and
other ingredients, ran the total tip
to approximately JJOO.OOO when
llilllngaley sold it. he Is today al
most a bankrupt. Mis, bank ac
count shows he has only $2.70®.
Ililllngslev Is about 35. He is
usually suave and cheerful. Today
he looked rath< r haggard and pale
It is believed that he wants to
mnV>' a "cle'in breast of the whole
IsKize ring and the graft that went
wlth'lt." because the men whom
lie hnit "ereased" failed to come
thru with bail money for him.
. Several raids by Sergi Putnam's
dry stpiad on drug stores and ware
houses of the Hilllngsleyn put a
large > rimp in their bankroll. This,
however.*did not amount to any]
more than the protection" money
which Hltlinnaley. in his easy-going*
»a>. is alleged to have paid to va
rious officials
millngsley was to have been ar
raigned before Judge Xeterer yes
terday afternoon, but this was post
ixaied t<> this aftemoon. •
Hillingsley is represented in the
proceedings l»>' Wilbur U Cum
mins*. of the firm of Vanderveer &
-Camming*.
R. J. Margett. former Seattle po
liceman. who is under indictment in
another liquor case. was one of (he
chief witnesses before the grand
Jury Wednesday. It Is believed that
he "squealed" on Hlllingsley.
Margett was suspended from the
force la«t fall when he is alleged
to have tipped off Clarence Herald
tha' a raid was planned by Sergt.
Putnam and the dry squad
l.n|er he was arrested In a ware
house. and correspondence showed
hltn to have been an active bootleg
ger. liii- business being.conducted
with the Jesse Hunt Moore com
pany of San Francisco, the same
firm wllh whom Ililllngslev dealt.
This morning, when Hlllingsley
vas brought to the district attor
