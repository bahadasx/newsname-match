■ T wns a suprems
tost of friendship,
in ar s on N e w
Year’s. Wrapped to
her ears in fur,
with a cap meeting
her collar, Wini
fred stood on the
bleak little platform at Byers' Cor
ners and looked through the snowfall
for anything that seemrd to be u con
veyance.
She had left Boston at s:4s—plenty
of time to reach Windyheath in good
time, Anne had written her.
“It’s Just a nice little run over from
Providence on the Providence and Wll
llmantic line. We'll meet you at Byers’
Corners. The trains only slop there on
signal or to let off visitors, and the
only visitors that ever come are ours.
If Itolf or I can't come over I’ll send
a wonderful substitute."
Evidently Itolf* Anne and the sub
stitute had been overcome by the
storm. Trains had been delayed from
Boston to Providence and on the little
local line they had waited again and
again along the way. There had been
no real need of any signal to let bet
oil' when Byers' Corners came in view
The drifts were so high 'that it took
the train -it minutes to get out ol
Byers' Corners, let atone getting In.
But again Anne laid written:
"Don’t feel discouraged •'
We in the
on . I
but u underfill ' ll( ‘
and we're idling on
Stood on the Bleak Little Platform.
and the latchstring dangles, so be
sure and come. Also, I have your—
romance! lie has come true, Win, at
last, and he’s all that anyone who
loves you could wish for you.”
It certainly was stimulating, if noth
ing else, both the lure of the letter
and the trip Itself. Winifred went
around the other side of the tiny sta
tion and heard voices. A man was
arguing about some way of reaching
the Delmars, and the stocky driver ol
a two-horse sleigh demurred evasively
“It’s nine miles ordinarily up there
and we’d have to go rouadbout by
Butts’ bridge tonight ’cause the roads
ain’t been broke through t’other way,
and then like enough we’d never make
it. It’s worth live dollars to drive over
there, every cent of It.”
‘Til pay you five,” said the stranger.
"Hurry up.”
“I can’t guarantee to get you there,
hut I’ll do my best. This here’s the
only team in town you could get to
night. There’s a dance over at Pom
fredt Green and everybody’s gone. I
meant to go, Hut I hud to take some
folks down to tills train, so I don’t
mind making a little going since I had
to earn some .coming.”
"Oh, could I go with you, please?"
Winifred broke in. “I’d pay half, don’t
you know, and ttierc’s plenty of room.
I’m going to the Delmars, too.”
It seemed too good to be true when
she found herself safely tucked away
on the back sent, with buffalo robes
around her and the two horses taking
up the road splendidly, their hoofs
throwing buck a spray of light scow.
He was Gregory Knmsdell, he told
her, writer and globe trotter. He had
jusl got hack from a year at the front
In Europe and he said Connecticut
hills looked better to him than all the
old world put together. Even In the
darkness the pine trees stood out, their
branches heavy with snow, and before
them here and there in the fields were
clumps of white birch and red oak,
with dry leaves still clinging to their
boughs. The stars shone famously up
In the winter sky.
. Gregory half turned In his sent and
talked. They had many friends In com
mon. He had known Kolf since they
were boys hack In Denver. Neither of
them noticed after five miles had been
covered that the horses were walk
ing, breasting the drifts and literally
wading through, until they came to a
dead halt and the driver jumped out.
They couldn’t go on, he said. The snow
was up to the top of the fences as
far as one could see. He could turn
around and get them up to the old
Annabelle Smith place, where there
was a telephone, and they could cull
up Windyheath.
“It’s only nine-thirty,” Gregory said
reassuringly. “And we don’t get an
adventure every day. Let's go.”
The Smith place was dark when they
reached It, hut the driver knocked
lustily and finally there was a faint,
frightened voice from the Inner side
of the front door asking who It was at
that time of night. Gregory explained,
with the driver’s help, and they were
admitted.
"But you can’t get word through to
night. The wires don’t work. They
never do after a big storm on these
here party lines," said Miss Smith,
holding up a big oil lamp. “.Just step
right out into the kitchen and you stir
up the lire, Ira. Make yourselves to
home, folkses. Ira can drive hack and
maybe telephone from the village up
there.”
Winifred never forgot that New
Year’s eve. After Ira had gone, they
sat out in the cheery old kitchen,
drinking ten, eating nuts and apples
and mince pie, and getting fearfully
well acquainted, us Miss Smith put it
laughingly. Gregory carried in wood
lilitI ilit kindlings for morning, and
up for the night. While Miss
went up to look after her old
len father, (hey sat together by
*, and somehow talk died away.
1 clock up on the chimney man
:ly struck twelve in the* silence.
i*d looked up and smiled, her
eanlng hack on the cushioned
the old black rocker,
ipy New Year!" she said. "Isn’t
queerest tiling, our being way
tip here miles from everyone we know,
and not knowing each other even, and
starting off the new year together?”
"It’s great,” Gregory clasped his
bunds around one knee, seated on the
woodbox under the big Dutch oven.
"I’m not superstitious, but after ramb
ling for a year over there this seems
awfully much worth while. You know
I’d almost begun to think, If you won’t
mind my saying so, that there wasn’t
anyone like you In the world.”
Miss Smith hurried through the en
try way.
"Ira’s back with a bigger team and
he’s going to take you through all
right, he says. He drove over that
bad spot In the roads and broke It for
you. And he’s telephoned to Mrs. Del
mar that you’re coming.”
It was nearly two when they reach
ed Windyheath. All of the windows
of the big country house were lighted
up, and Anne herself, wrapped In a
wonderful velvet and fur housegown,
ran down the steps to meet them.
“Oh, my dear, my dear!” she cried
when she had Winifred safely upstairs
In he- room, “You poor child 1”
“I’m not poor,” Winifred said ra
diantly. "I’ve had the most beautiful
adventure of my whole life, and I’m In
love. I agree with you and fate this
time."
“But It isn’t Gregory I want you to
meet,” faltered Anne. “You haven’t
gone and fallen In love with dear old
Greg?”
“I have," Winifred laughed happily.
"Both of us have. I never believed in
love at first sight before, or anything
like It, but I’ve made some wonderful
resolutions for the new year this
time.”
"Now listen to me and the whole
comedy. Anne curled up on the bed
confidentially. “The man you were to
marry Is right down smoking with
Itolf this minute. He’s Madison Forbes,
with money, position, everything, my
dear. But he didn’t think you’d try
to make the trip such a night, so I’ve
been 'phoning madly everywhere to
find out if you had arrived and where.
Then I would have tried to get to you.
We sent out a car and It couldn’t get
through, and the horses couldn’t ei
ther.”
“Don’t worry," Winifred smiled at
her reflection in the triple mirror at
the dressing table. “I don’t give a rap
about the money or position or any
thing, Anna. We’ve been right out In
to the primitive world together, lost
In the snow, and I’d go with him to
the ends of the world If this blessed
old world had any ends. He said, Just
as we were driving In here, It was the
most promising New Year’s he had
ever known.’’
Old Father Time
By HARRY IRVING GREENE V
Western Newspaper t’nlon.
""I 1 came with Space, and hand in hand ■—
We two sat here alone,
As two twin Kings of equal might
Sit side by side athrene
While eons came, and eons went,
In ceaseless passing flight,
And all was still as dungeons deep,
And black as moonless night.
Then age by age—a million years
We watched the Sun take form,
While through the void in endless count,
The Stars were being born -%
And then from out unfathomed Space,
We saw the world appear.
I shook my glass—and from it fell,
A Sand of Time —the first New Year.
The Years! I watched them come and go,
Till I could count no more,
The Old —the New—like falling rain,
Or sands upon a shore.
Through age of Mist, and age of storm,
And age of sweeping Flame,
Till last Man came with gift of speech.
And gave to me my Name
Old Father Time, he calls me now,
As close 1 glean my tithe.
1 walk the Earth with silent thread,
Yet ever sweep my Scythe.
Forever old, yet doomed to live,
I’d rest —but none is here.
Again 1 raise my Glass and pour
mJ Another Sand—a new, New Year. L*

“How strange a thing Is the Ingrati

accents. “Man is not satisfied with all
the benefits the year has bestowed
upon him, hut must scoff at winter
and regard him ns a mortal foe.
‘Thus winter falls
A heavy gloom oppressive o’ci the world.
Through Nature shedding influence ma

for winter?” —Countryside Magazine.
