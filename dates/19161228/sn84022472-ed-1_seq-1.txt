TRY TO PROVE
S. FAIR WAS
ALIVE IN JUNE
1 ' ' :
Defense in Manslaughter
Case Introduces Testimony
of Her Physician.
.. . i
Proof that Margaret Fair was alive
in June, '1914, was offered in the
criminal superior court this morning
by. counsel for .William F. Fair and
Jack Deveraux, tao claim the 'body
found in the Darien woods was not
that' of Mrs. Fair. A deposition of
Coroner's Physician Charles L. Bailey
of Albany, N. Y., in which he declar
ed he performed an operation on Mrs.
Fair- in December, 1914, was read
to the jury. - ..
Dr. Bailey . testified that hfe often
treated Mrs. Fairwho was known in
Albany as Grace Clifton. She came
to him December 3, 1914, for an op
eration .which was performed the fol
lowing day. . She gave the name of
Grace Brown when entering the hos
pitaV because1 she did not wantj it
known that she was to undergo ap
operation. . Dr. Daily said the wom
an was addicted to these of a druer
called varanol. He identified a ptc
tureXof Mrs. Fair as the woman he
had treated but was confused regard
ing the color of her hair.
I Dr. Allen Wadsworth', who conducts
a sanitarium in Norwalk, was intro-r
dhced as another witness for the de
defense to tell of the effects of varanol
upon , the human system. " He said it
gave the same results as a "concen
trated jag." Those addicted to Its use
bought the drug when they could not
get whiskey for its effects are, about
the same. He said it caused women
victims to have a desire to disrobe.
As.. Mrs. Fair used the drug the de
fense inferred that she might have
walked out into the woqda and dis
robed after taking a dose.
The trial was continued this after
non. It is expetced it will be finished
in two more days.

'". Ill ( T V
A nocturnal descent- on the coal
barge, "C. R. Gardner," by ten men
led . in person by Roderick McNeil,, a
prominent coal dealer- whose actions
the captain of the boat charges were
due to the scarcity of coal in Bridge
port resulted in a pitched- battle,
when McNeil ' attempted J' to make off
with the boat, in which "one of, the
raiders received injuries from . which
he may die. , '
Courageously facing the men, the
captain of the barge, Jacob Shepp, 39
years of age, and his wife Elizabeth
drove McNeil and the coal heavers
headlong from the barge. McNeil,
according to the , woman, mistooK a
flashlight which she was carrying for
a gun.
She told Lieut. E. O. Cronan this
morning that McNeil crying "Don't
shoot, for God's sake," leaped over the
side of the barge into the tug "John
Glen" which lay moored alongside,
fled precipitately into the tug cabin
and locked himself in. Their leader
gone, , the others followed: leaving
Christopher Oisen, . a coal heaver, in
the employ of McNeil, lying uncon J.
scious on the deck. . :
'His skull had been crushed. in hy a
smashing blow dealt him, 'frith an im
mense capstan bar in the hands of the
captain. He was ' removed and - taken
in an' automobile to the : Bridgeport
hospital, by McNeil. , . It was stated at
the latter institution that Olsen is 26
years of age, lives at 591 East street,
and is -: receiving private treatment.
The , records at the institution 1 state
that" he is' employed "by 'Archibald
McNeil, coal dealer." .
The trouble which, led to. the battle
"cm the deck of the iboat started about
;8 o'cjapk last night Capt. Shepp had
arrived in the outer harbor, with his
barge containing i;000tons of soft
coal .and lay moored to a stake boatv.
Owing j to the darkness of the night
he did not venture up the power house
channel to thedocks of the Connect!
cut Co. power house,5 to" whom, he
states, the cargo was consigned. .
. A'thick fog had settled like a. funer
al pall over the harbor, when the cap
tain's wife, who was out on deck, dis
cerned in the. murky atmosphere, the
wraith-like form of a tug steal noise
less alongside. .The forms of ten
or a dozen men, she could not tell the
exact number, ; ijlid silently over the
BiutJ UJ. ixi uaigc ,.uu. liio iu, wuivu
proved to be the "Glen" was' made
fasfalongside. -. ..; ,. ,
A man whom the captain and his
wife now state was Roderick, McNeil,
approached the lone woman, who
stood at the bow of the" boat', and
asked, where the captain was. Mrs.
Shepp replied, he was in the cabin.
She says that, thereupon, McNeil
turned to his men, and said: - .
"Let the lines go, boys. We're go
ing to take this iboat." , . .,
Shepp's wife ran and summoned
him from " the cabin , and the cap-,
tr'n rushing on deck.i inquired what
he mean't hy trying, to take his boat,
reaching over at the same time to re-
tie the lines, before the barge was
adrift. In his story of the trouble
told today to Lieut. E. O. Cronan,
Shepp claims that McNeil then said to
him: '
"I'll give you a dollar; if you'll, let
me tow you up to my dock.. I know
the coal isn't mine, but. there is not
a pound of coal in my yard and I need
it. .These men here are all idle and
need something to do."-. '.., .,. .
1 The captain states that lie refused
the offer' and the stake was raised to
$20, Shepp replying that no money
could bribe him. -.
"This cargo of coal is consigned to
the Connecticut Co. . I have ' the
the-papers here in my pocket3 and
nothing will stop me delivering it.
I'm the boss, and .you f ellows get to
h off." ,
Shepp then states that McNeil said,
"Is that so? Well, we'll take it any
how," following his remark by push
ing the captain, and grabbing his
arm. Shepp is a doughty, thick set,
typical mariner, with Isturdy legs. He
shook McNeil off him, and admits
that he struck the coal dealer a back
hand blow in the mouth, which
slightly disturbed the latterfs equili
brium. ,
McNefl, Shepp related to the police,
then turned to his followers and
shouted: "At him, boys! Get him!
Get him!" But the captain was not
to he "got." His wife, shivering in
the y damp , fog, peered through the
maze with clenched fists and assumed
a threatening attitude at the , cap
tain's side.
The gang rushed for the two lone
figures, a burly coal heaver leading
the way. He got within about two
feet of the captain when Shepp's right
fist shotthrough the air. A resound
ing whack followed and the intruder
hit the decks with 'a thud. The crowd
backed away and the captain ran , to
his cabin, reappearing with the cap
stan bar.
His wife meanwhile had procured a
flashlight which, she pretended was a
gun. The pair .again took a resolute
stand on the deck" and once more the
coal , heavers rushed him. With deadly
precision the captain swished through
