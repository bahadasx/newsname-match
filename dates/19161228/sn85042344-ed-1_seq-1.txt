are resulting In good. It was sal. I w it h
authority toiitehl that until the door
to peace actually is closed hy the oiift
side or the other, President Wilson
will continue to hope that any dis.
ciisshin of the subject will tend to
hasten the end of the war.
Count von Iternstorff, the (ierman
amlmssador, returning unexpectedly
tonight from New Voik. authorized
the Associated Press to make the fol
lowing statement:
'I regard tin' note of my govern
incut us constituting an aiTcptumi' of
ovoiv thing suggested hy I'rosldciil
ll-im ill his note tu the belligerent
nations in l iiionc."
It was made clear at the
embassy .
that Germany stands ready to make
known her terms on the first day of
any conference that may he held and
officials expressed themselves as helm;
greatly surprised at the view prevail
ing in Home quarters here that the
Mcrlui government had failed to meet
the president's suggestions hy not sct
tinv down in the reply the terms upon
w hich it Is willing to make peace. The
German diplomats say President Wil
son had no intention of drawing a
pulilic ilcoliiation concerning terms
from thi' central powers.
The Herman policy upon which the
reply to President Wilson's com
munication is liused wag outlined at

Germany feels that the con
ference suggested hy it first

whose duty It would ho to settle
tt rrltorial terms, unce these
terms are agreed upon, repre
sentatives of the neutrals should

that neutral nations can have no
Interest of their own In terms
such as those relating to territory.
While there were no official advices
upon the suhject, the view still per

That the allies will declare that

to

the
president and in their reply
to
entral powers was the growing belief
lore today both on the basis of atate-

mcnts at the allied embassies and from
...ii.i.wl nress comment. A London
dispatch today following one from
Pelrograd yesterday as well as intima
tions from both Paris and Koine that
the allies could not discuss peace until
they actually held tho territories they
considered essential for their future,
was, taken to indicate that the allies
wanted to wait for n substantial vic
tory and a reversal of tho present
military situation.
Itiilnln's Move Surprise.
c.reat Hritn.li! n invitation to me
premiers of all the colonies to attend
an imperial war conference to iiscuss
"possible conditions on wnicn in agree
ment with our allies we could consent
to its termination," proved n decided
surprise here where the step Was taken
as Indicating the seriousness with
which the peace movement Is viewed
in Kngland. The holding of such u
conference, however, Is expected to be
subsequent to tho allied replies to
President Wilson and tho central
powers, and for the purpose of out
lining much hronder polities thuti
have yet appeared. .
Altho Secretary Lnnslng said today
that full Information regarding all of
the recent submarine attacks on ves
sels In w hlch the Pnited States Is In

on that question is expected du ling the

The unfinished condition of the new

discussion a loom- the state legislators
and the members of the legislitut "

that lie Is rather in favor of a nost

While rtv, ernor Williams has not
signified any decision relative to a
postponement of the session, ho did.
before the Tulsa Invitation was ex
tended, declare that such a move
might not be unwise, and thai this
action would not Interfere with the
general operation of the state govern
ment. For some years the legislature has
occupied quarters in the India Temple
building in Oklahoma City, but now
these are used for other purposes and
cannot be secured as session halls.
Damp. AsM-rt,
The greatest objection raised by the
early arriving legislators who have
visited tho Incompleted capltol build
Inn to holding the session there on
schedule time Is that the dampness of
the structure, due to the freshly
poured concrete, will be dangerous to
the health of the representatives.
Senator It. A. Keller of Marietta
declares that it would be ridiculous

That the new building is in such an

meeting nnv where else than lit II. o

them to hold tho session now he has
no particular objection to waiting a

but he can bo outvoted Just the sumo

lhat ho should take a view opposite
that of Governor Williams. However.
II the lieiilenant-governor says there
will be no recess he will probably
have some support In that. There are
those who want the session held now,
even If quarters downtown must he

there Is no absolutely urgent legisla

of
W. S. Hooker," said Judi'o Colin
i.tnn last night "An answer was
filed by Mr. North, alleging sul stan
llallv the same things as set forl.'i bv
Hooker. I appointed A. A, Unt il as
referee and ho began counting th

It seems that tho vods cast for Sher

tin grounds that he had erred In
I ringing the action. 1 believed he
was right on tho polnla of law In

Mi. North asked that the recount he
continued i n tho strength of the an
swi r he had filed, f gave Hen Conner,
his alti'imv, half a day to prepare
his arguments. lie came into court
and the iiiiestinn was argued pro ami

Issued cl'tiflcalc.
' Hooker then upplied for s writ of
mandamus compelling the election
board to Issue him a certificate. I
issued the writ and made II return
able today. This morning two mem
bers of tile election board stated un
der oath that the alleged error in
Lynn Lane .precinct No. 1 had heen
made and announced their willingness
lo Issue Hooker a certificate of elec
tion. I Instructed them to do so and
he now has Ills certificate.
"Tho only legal manner in which a
locoiint of votes can ho had is by ipio
warranto proceedings, which can only
bo Instituted after one of Ihe candi
dates Is in office. As soon ns Mr.
Hooker takes tho oath of office Mr.
North can file quo warranto proceed
ings alleging Irregularities In all or
a pail of the precincts and then we
can go back of the returns and re
count nil of the votes.
"It is all a question of law and t
have ruled as I thot tight. I believa
i very lawyer in town will say that I
have done the light tiling."
North Was Flocled.
Thru mi error in precinct No. 10,
city of Tulsa. Mr. North lost 4.1 votes
that were rightfully h's. A recount
will adjust this error and Insure his
election by a plurality of more than
loiiy-flve votes in spile of the errors
In l.itill Lane and lsewher that were
against Hooker. In the recent re
count precinct 10 was one of three
precincts that were not counted when
