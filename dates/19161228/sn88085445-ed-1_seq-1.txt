Vol. IX
WOULD START UP A
BACK-FIRE BOYCOTT
Dairymen I'rge Blacklist of City Pro
ducts as Retaliation for Fight on
Butter and Eggs.
That a counter boycott against city
products may be started by the
flallJlHWl of the state as a means of
retaliation against the city black
listing of dairy products, is indicated
in a campaign started this week as a
preliminary to the State Dairymen's
Association meeting in Auburn.
The Clallam County Dairymen's
Association this week adopted reso
lutions to bring the matter before the
state meeting, and instructed its del
egates to work for a boycott.
The following are the Clallam
County resolutions:
•Whereas. Certain associations
and clubs af the city of Seattle have ;
recently held meetings and passed J
resolutions looking to the boycotting
of certain farm products of the state
'of Washington, more particularly
butter and eggs, said associations,
after having obtained full and com
plete information as to the cost to
the farmer of the production of said
produce, have and are now unfairly,
unjustly and without due cause, con
ducting a boycott and endeavoring
to arbitrarily fix the price that the
farmer shall receive for such prod
uct; and
"Whereas, If by reason of such
boycott the price of said products
drop to the level aimed at by these
boycotters, it will result in a clean
loss to the dairymen of the state oi
Washington, during this season, ol
$750,000 and will not Injure the so
called middleman one dollar; and
further.
"Whereas. The.se boycotters seen,
to fail to understand that the whok
world for the present is living undei
abnormal conditions, and that thf
citizens of all classes should be pre
pared to bear their share of the bur
den imposed by these conditions and
not shoulder them onto another class
no better able to bear them;
"Wishing to live in accord witl
our neighbors of the cities, we stil.
believe in justice and fair play, anc
It is with regret that we feel com
pelled to take steps to protect our
selves by the starting of a countei
boycott by abstaining from purchas
ing. as long as the city boycott re
mains in force, all articles of cloth
ing, groceries, farm machinery, etc..
from the merchants or branch houses
of the cities showing pernicious ac
tivity in the boycott of said farn
products.
"All dairymen. _ creamerymen
poultrymen. grange'and farmer or
ganizations and all others directb
interested in the above named indus
tries are invited to cooperate in tint
movement and arrange for a staU
meeting.
"The delegates elected from this
county to the State Dairymea's Asso
ciation meeting are hereby instructeo
to bring this matter before the State
Dairymen's Association."
Whatcom County and the Lynden
district will be represented at the
state meeting.

UNTIL we have at least eight thirty-five-knot battle cruisers (two divi
sions of four each, armed with sixteen inch guns) in the Atlantic
and an equal fleet in the Pacific our coast* anil coastal cities will
not be safe from ATTACK AND RAID, ALMOST AT WILL, BY
THE SWIFT BATTLE CBTJISEB DIVISION'S OF A HOSTILE
POWER, NO MATTER HOW MANY BATTLESHIPS WE MAY
HAVE.
For the United States more than for any other naval power a swift,
powerful and homogeneous battle cmiiser fleet in each ocean is a sine qua
non for our naval supremacy and for the safegvarding of our extended
coasts from ruinous and humiliating attacks and raids.
No nurrber of battleships within reason will protect our coasts from
raid and damage by an enemy's battle cruisers vi less we have a sufficient
number of battle cruisers ourselves.
No one interested in insuring our country against attack can object t<
building more battleships if they are built in addition to a sufficient num
ber of battle cruisers.
But I submit for the most earnest consideration whether it may no
be most unwise at present to build battleships at the expense of brttl.
cruisers. We now have a considerable number of battleships. We hay
no battle cruisers.
A HOSTILE BATTLE CRUISER DIVISION WILL BE A DEADLY MEN
ACE. THE ONLY ANSWER TO IT if A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BAT
TLE CRUISE RS OF OUR OWN.

LYNDEN'S ORIGINAL
EDITOR RETURNS
W. H. Dobbs, Who Started Pioneer
Press in November, IHHH, Comes
Back for Visit.
W. H. Dobbs. who published the
first newspaper in the city when
Lynden was not much taller than a
sparrow, visited in Lynden this
week. Dobbs is now connected with
the Automatic Electric Controller
Company of Seattle.
Dobbs began the publication of the
Pioneer Press in Lynden, November
1, 1888, and kept it running over
the hard times for seven or eight
years. One edition during the strin
gent times was printed on wallpaper
owing to the fact that no money
could be raised to purchase regular
print paper. This edition contained
an expose of conditions in some of
the state institutions, and was mtiiled
to all the legislators and aided in
bringing about reforms.

WHATCttM COUNTY HINTERS
FAVOR LATE OPEN SEASON
Whatcom County sportsmen went
on record Tuesday favoring the open
ing of the season for all upland game
birds October 15 aud the closing of
the season November 30, in place of
the present season of six weeks, be
ginning September 15 and closing
October 31. The action was taken
following the request of Representa
.ive C. I. Roth for an expression of
opinion on the matter and was the
.esult of discussion of ways and
means of checking the present de
crease in the game birds of the
county.
The meeting was helu at the call
of C. C. Siegel. chairman of the coun
ty game commission, at the Belling
ham Chamber of Commerce rooms,
and plans were laid for the forma
tion of a permanent organization of
fishermen and hunters for the pro
tection of fish and game and for co
operation with the authorities to this
end. There were nearly forty per
sons present.
A number of proposed changes in
the fish and game code of the state
recommended to the legislature by
the state convention of county game
wardens and commissioners were
presented by Mr. Siegel and dis
cussed at length by those present.
The appropriation of $25,000 from
the game fund of the state for the
establishment of a hatchery and rear
ing station at Walla Walla for the
propagation of pheasants was talked
of. and although no vote was taken
it was tacitly approved. Another
amendment which proposes to place
the opening and closing of seasons in
the hands of the commissions of the
various counties was argued pro and
con.
—From the Maple Falls Leader.
A B. & N. passenger train the
other day made the amazing time of
37 miles in five hours, or 7 2-5 miles
per hour, between Bellingham and
Maple Falls. It will be remembered
that Stevenson, who used to invent
steam engines, railroads, etc., could
travel five miles an hour with ease.
He could speed up to 15 miles an
hour, but ordinances, etc., were in
farce prohibiting joy riding above
five miles per hour. There are no
speed ordinances along this line, so
there is no limit to speed, and the
B. & N. trains are at liberty to beat
Stevenson's record of 15 miles per
hour if they feel sporty.
Mr. and Mrs. H. H. Jamieson cele

WANT PAVED ROAD
ALONG BOUNDARY
Havnie Grunge Starts Movement to
Have i .on it.\ Hard-Surface Blame
Sumas Highway.
A proposal to hard surface the
road from Blame to Sumas with
county funds has been maue by the
Haynie Grange, and is being sup
ported by the Blame people.
The movement is outlined in the
following article from the Blame
Journal:
"The proposition to have the
Blaine-Sunias road paved next year if
possible, one that has been talked of
more or less for some time, took de
finite shape this week when it was
announced that the Haynie Grange
had selected a committee to promote
the improvement. The idea origin
ated with the Haynie Grange, which
has quietly communicated with sis
ter granges with the result that no
thing but encouragement has been
met with.
"The plan is to pave the present
road between Blame and Sumas with
concrete. This can be done by the
property owners along the road pay
ing half and the other half to be paid
out of the state aid funds as practi
cally all of the paving in the county
has been done. Another suggestion
that might have some merit is that
federal aid be secured and designate
the road an international highway.
"The people in the Lynden country
are a unit in favor of the proposition
we are informed, and will render all
all the aid in their power.
"All of the paving yet done in the
county has been from Bellingham
out. The Blaine-Sumas road is about
the only main highway runnnig east
and west in the county and there
ought not to be any serious opposi
tion to its improvement from other
parts of the county.
"Next year there will be a goodly
«urn -n the state aid road fund to the
cr dit of Whatcom county, and so far
as we have learned, the Blaine-Su
mas paving proposition is the only
one that has been mentioned for the
coming year,the Ferndale-Enterprise
proposition having been turned down
by the State Highway Commission.
"The people of Blame, Lynden and
Sumas ought to get back of the
Blaine-Sumas paving proposition
with one accord. It is an important
road and its hard surfacing would
make it all the more so. Un the other
hand, the northern part of the coun
ty has paid thousands of dollars of
taxes into the state aid road fund
and the nearest they have ever come
to getting any of it back is the pave
ment this last season into Ferndale."
