Our end of the past week's
blizzard which swept the country
to the north, manifested itself in
high jwinds and snow squalls.
Saturday and Monday were the
worst days in that respect seen
here for years. At the present
writing the weather is fine.
B. C. Barker, a homesteader
who is located twenty miles
straight east of Estancia, reports
having secured a plentiful sup
ply of very fine water at a depth
of 332 feet. It furnishes all the
water that a 2-inch pipe will car
ry R. N. Maxwell tells us that the
state has at last got water on the
state land in the Palma district.
One 700-foot well furnishes a
fair supply, and one 1275 feet in
depth furnishes a copious supply.
Mr. Ballard, the Pecos Valley
cattle man who leased most of
the state land in that district,
now has pumping outfits over
both wells. It is said that the
outfit over the deep well cost
$3,000. Engines are used, the
lift being too great for wind
mills. The Btate supreme court has
entered an order releasing
Augustin Kayser from jail to
which he was sentenced recently
by District Judge E. L. Medler
of Las Cruces for sixty days for
consecutive contempt. The
charge was that. Kayser tamp
ered with a witness during the
trying of a case at Estancia.
Judge Edward R. Wrighc insti
tuted habeas corpus proceedings
and the court granted the writ
on the ground that no regular in
formation against Kayser had
been filed New Mexican.
Farmers' Week at State Col
lege will be a highly interesting
and instructive week for those in
attendance, and it is hoped there
will be a good attendance from
this county. No matter what
you are particularly interested
in, you will find it ably handled.
It is called "Farmers' and Home
makers' Week," and every
phase of the subject is covered
in the program, which includes
the names of all the College
Staff as speakers, besides a num
ber of prominent men from oth
er states. The dates are Jan. 8
to 13 inclusive. County Agent
Harwell will furnish anyone in
terested with a full program,
and give any other information
desired.
Burrus Bros,, got in a car of
corn, corn chop and oats the lat
part of last week.
J. D. Fuller, who came from
Texas a month or two ago, has
rented the M. C. Daugherty
place. He has taken possession
and is getting ready to farm
next season.
Mrs. Minnie Brumback, who
has been official stenographer of
the state corporation commission,
has been named corporation
clerk by the commission, taking
the place made vacant by the
death of Thomas J. Sanford.
Miss Mamie Hotz, of the commis
sion, succeeds Mrs. ürumback as
official stenographer. New Mex
ican. It is to be feared that a num
ber of us in Estancia have fallen
into the habit of letting our cut
going letters accumulate until
we hear the train whistle,' and
then rushing to the train with
the whole batch. This is not
only unfair to the mail clerk, but
it may react upon ourselves. The
privilege of mailing letters on
the train is granted to accom
modate emergency cases for let
ters that cannot be prepared in
time for dispatch through the
postoffice. We had better break
the habit, and mail ail letters
through the postoffice that are
ready in time.
J. A. Teague, who lives near
Mountainair, was in Estancia
last week. Mr. Teague does not
farm very much, devoting his at
tention to stock and particularly
to poultry. During the past
year he kept 300 hens, and his
egg sales have run from $60 to
$120 per month. He finds diffi
culty in getting good hatches of
chicks thinks it may be due to
the altitude, and so he has adopt
ed the practice of buying day-old
chicks from Albuquerque, which
he raises with a very small per
centage of loss. Last spring he
bought 1,000 at 12 1-zc each, and
will soon have a large increase in
his flock of laying hens.
The Sunday school board of
the Methodist Episcopal church
met Thursday evening after

Mayme Hayes;

Roll superintendent, Mrs. Kemp.
There was no change in the
teachers of classes. It was de
cided by the, board to observe
the first Sunday of each month
as Mission Sunday, the collection
to be divided between the boards
of home and foreign missions.

The pupils of Mrs. Parrett's
and Mrs. Grimmell's rooms gave

motion picture theatres in the
United States; a Delco lighting
system of the largest capacity
made, which will furnish electric
lights for the building and the
machine; and the best curtain
made.
The films used will be the
Paramount, Fox and Essenay,
which stand at the head of the
list in quality and popularity,
featuring such stars as Mary
Pickford, Marguerite Clark and
Charlie Chaplin, varied by oc
casional educational and current
event films. There will be music
at every show.
This kind of an outht and this
class of films will give Estancia
as goo'd a show as any city in t,ne
i i i
iana can uuasi.
Mr. Stubblefield promises to
make popular prices, and it is
sure to bea highly popular place
of entertainment.
ELY TO HOLD HIS JOB
District Judge Edmund C. Ab

days' furlough, left this after

serving as colonel or tne iNew

He confirmed the report that
he had denied the petition of
certain bondholders to have
Ralph Ely removed as receiver
of the New Mexico Central rail

Mr. Ely was filling the position
in an acceptable manner. The
judge added that he did not wish
to see the railroad torn up ana
he expressed satisfaction with
the efforts Mr. Ely has been
making to cut down expense and
to put the road in a condition to
appeal to investors. Ely has
traveled a good deal since he be

terest investors in the railroad
prjject and he has conferred
with a number oi nnanciers in
the middle west, east and also on
the coast.
