KANSAS GAME PPEW $23,500
Thanksgiving Day Given as Cause
for 12.500 Attendance.
The annual Missnuri-K insas foot
ball game is assuming the prupor
tions of the largest athletic contest
in the Missouri Valley. The re
ceipts for the Thanksgiving Day
game at Lawrence, Kas. were $23,
.500. The receipts for the game of
two years ago in Lawrence were
$18,600. The change of the date of
the game from the Saturday before
to Thanksgiving Day is given as
the cause for the increase. Twelve
thousand five hundred followers of
football saw this yea r'scon test.
Fire Alarm Again
Last Sunday morning fire was
discovered at the home of Mrs.
Watson Derritt, in the east part ol
town. The flames started from a
bucket of ashes thrown against the
aide of the smoke-house. The fire
bad a pretty good start but was
quickly extinguished by the
"Bucket Brigade". The smoke
bouse was considerably damaged.
You Ought to See It
You ought to see that new milk
ing machine Walter Moss does his
milking with. It certainly beats
milking by hand. With it Mr. Moss
milks two cows at a time without
doing any work at nil He milks
28 cows in an hour and fifteen
minutes now and it used to take
two men two hours and a half to
milk them by hand. Just figure
for yourself how much time he is
saving.
Mr. Moss now sells rtom 80 to 90
gallons of milk nich day and it is
easy to see where the profit from
the machine will come in. He can
increase the number of cows from
28 to 56 and do the milking in the
same time that it used to take. He
can aitnch to his machine six more
units, or "cow-milkers",
and by hiring three more men. can
milk 112 cows in the same time in
which he now milks 28. That would
mean instead of selling from 80 to
90 gallons of milk each day, he
would sell from 320 to 360 gallons.
This machine is constructed by
the Sharpies Separator Company
and is the first of its kind to be in
stalled in this neighborhood. If any
one thinks it impractical they
should go out and wutch Mr. Moss
use his machine. He can tell you
a whole lot more about it than we
can, and what he can't tell you.
you'll find in the bulletin describ
ing it, which you can obtain from
A. Jaeger
McClintic Leads
R. S. McClintic, of this city, seems
to be in the lead for President Pro
Tern of the State Senat . The
choice bad simmered down to he and
another fellow. From the latest
reports, Gardner is in favor of our
fellow townsman. Mr. McClintic
is one of the leading men in tbe
State Senate and we are sure that
no better man could be found to
fill the place.
