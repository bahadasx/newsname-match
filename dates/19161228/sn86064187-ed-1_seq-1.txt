Ames Sayings ,
HIGH rates of interest will soon
be permanently abolished in
all parts of the Unit erf
States.
Labor organiratinns resent control
by the public as much as the organi
rations of capital resented it forty
years ago.
These organiiations are just as
billing to make the people pay the
price as capital was forty years aRo.
We need not be surprised in the
near future to nee a test of strength
on this subject.
The tendency of modern legisla
tion is toward an extensive control
by the state, both of property ami
people within its domain.
There is an activity of governmen
tal control never before known in
our country.
That state governments will eventu
ally and soon attempt to pass legis
lation controlling organired labor, as
in the past they have enacted laws., by
which theyLsupervivf'ferganiied capital,
was the verbal bomti shot into the midst
of the Oklahoma Par associations an
nual meeting here this morning in the
Skirvin hotel by Judge C. B. Ames of
Oklahoma City in the president's an
nual address, the title of whiih was
The Tendency of Modem Legislation."
In addition, he predicted that the for
mation of the federal farm loan bank
ing tystem in connection with the fed
etal reserve act will remove perma
nently high interest rates in the United
States.
Power Settled.
"The power ot the state to regulate
srest aggregations of capital it pretty
thoroughly settled." said Judge Amet.
"and not only is the power to do it tet
tled. but the purpose to do it is like

aggregation of capital has resulted in

Carrania's answer to the request that
he either sign or repudiate the pending
protocol which will he delivered late
Mav to Secretary Lane hv l.ins li-

been carefully worded to avoid end

who had read the reply.

that the United States expected a final

to a severance of diplomatic relations
because, in a strict sense there never
