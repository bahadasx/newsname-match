In determining the Federal land
hank districts and in designating the
cities within such districts where Fed
eral land banks shall he located, the
otlb ial announcement says; "The Fed
eral Farm-Loan Hoard has given care
ful consideration to the farm-loan
needs of the country. The board held
public hearings in nearly every State
in the I'nion, and in this manner col
lected information of great value in
determining its decision.
"Every reasonable opportunity has
been afforded applicant cities to fur
nish evidence to support their claim as
locations of Federal land hanks. More
than seventy-five cities applied to be
designated as the headquarters of a
hank and were heard through repre
sentative committees and individuals."
The batiks will he established as soon
as practicable. Each will have a capa
city of $75,000. Application for loans
have been pouring into the board in
great volume recently, and it is esti
mated that a sum more than twenty
times in excess of the combined capi
tal stock could be used in making
loans.
Almost the first work of the bat.ks.
.ifter approving and issuing loans, will
be the Issuance of farm-loan bonds, a
new form of security In this country.
The bonds will he issued In denomina
tions as small as $2.1, it is expected,
and will bear interest at a rate of
1 per cent less than the interest rate
charged farmers on tljeir loans.
intkhkst iiatk not
ni--.FI N ITKI.1 niCTKH M I A Kll
What this interest rate will be has
not definitely been determined. I> is
limited by law to a maximum of
per cent. The expectation is that it
will not exceed 5 1-2 per cent at first
and subsequently may be lowered.
Loans on farming land are limited
by the law to 50 per cent of the value
of the land, and may be payable in
from five to forty years. As fast as
loans are made, bonds will be issued
to cover them so that at no time, un
der the present plan, will a bank's en
tire capital l?e tied up in loans to the
detriment of other applicants.
One of the chief tasks now con
fronting the board is to find ex
perienced employees for the new
banks. More than fi.000 applications
for positions have been received. The
appointments will be exempt from
civil service regulations, but the board
intends t.o assemble a corps of men
experienced in banking.
The head of each bank will be de
signaled as the registrar. They proh
ably will be only residents of the dls
trlets Involved and preferably attor
neys.
The banks will be organized tcm

immediate peace conference. ami the
forecast of a unanimous refusal by th?*
entente allies to enter such a oonfor
ence without know ins: Germany's
terms in advance. ilio American gov
< rnmont IpoIIcvps that the negotiations
in progress are resulting In good. It.
was saiii with authority to-night that j
until the door to peace actually is
I'iosfil by one side or the other. Presi
dent Wilson will continue to hope that
any discussion of tli?' subject will tend
to hasten tliend of the war.
Count von Iternstorff. the German
ambassador. returning unexpectedly
to-night from Xew VorU. authorized
the Associated Press to make the fol
lowing statement:
"I regard the note of tny govern
ment as constituting an acceptance of
everything suggested hy President
Wilson in his note to the bellligerent
nations of Kurope."'
It was made clear nt the embassy
that i iermany stands ready t" make
known her terms on the first day of
any conference that may be held, and
officials expressed themselves as being
greatly surprised at the view prevail
ing in some quarters here that the
Berlin government had failed to meet
the President's suggestions by not set
ting down in the reply the terms upon
which it is willing to make pence.

The German diplomats say Presi
dent Wilson has no intention of draw
ing a public declaration concerning
terms from the central powers. On thb
contrary, they think the President's
suggestion "that an early occasion be
sought to call out from all the nations
now at war such an avowal of their
respective views as to terms upon
which the war might be concluded."
has been fully met by Germany in
seeking an immediate conference with
her enemies.
The German policy upon which the
reply to President Wilson's communi
cation is based, was outlined as fol
lows:
Germany feels that the conference
suggested by it first should be com
posed of delegates from the belligerent
countries whose duty it would be to
settle territorial terms. Once these
terms are agreed upon, representatives
of the neutrals should called in to
participate in consideration of the
questions of guarantees for the future,
in which neutrals are as vitally con
cerned as belligerents. These guaran
tees. in the German view, necessarily
would have to do with the freedom of
the seas, limited disarmament, forma
tion of a world league of nations to
enforce peace and the establishment
of an international court of arbitra
tion.
Germany is said to consider that neu
tral nations can have no interest of
their own In terms such as those re
lating to territory.

While there were no official advices
upon the subject, the view still per
sisted in German quarters to-nlglit
that th.* note of the central power?
might be followed by some highly con
fidential oral or written communica
tion to President Wilson, in which a*
least broad tentative terms might be
sia ted.
In this connection officials noted with
Interest I'.erlin press dispatches saying
that Ambassador Gerard had taken
lunch with Alfred Zlinnierniann, the
German l-'orelgn Minister, anil probably
discussed the peace situation with
him.
Count von P.ernst orfT's arrival In
Washington was entirely unexpected,
as he had not planned to return until
to-morrow. It is not improbable that
he will \lsit the State Department
within the next few days to seek in
formation for his government and fur
nish the administration with any he
may have.
.lust what the United States could
do toward hrldginu the uulf in case
the allies hold to their opposition to
.i conference is the subject of serious
discussion among oflicials. ? but as yet
no concrete proposal has been ad
vanced. It is said officially th.it It
even has not yet been decided whether
this country will send on to the entente
the Teutonic reply to the President's
note as embodying a new suggestion,
oi whether its lucre publication h.-re
would be considered sufficient. The
official text of this reply is awaited,
and no further step is expected before
it arrives.
