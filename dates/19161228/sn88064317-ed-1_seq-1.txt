O NE Year ago in this week's issue of the paper appeared our announcement to the public telling them
that we had opened the "SERVICE" GARAG Î, and the past year we have builded up a business
that we are proud of. But we are prouder of the fact that it was LOYALTY and CONFIDENCE
of our FRIENDS in us and thereby giving us their business, which enabled us to do so.
Now we wish to announce to all our friends, customers and au
tomobile owners that we have contracted for a building, fireproof
and with all conveniences so that we can give you "SERVICE" in
even more efficient ways.
We Are Handling The
Chandler, Dodge and Maxwell Cars
The Maxwell-Smith F orm-a-truck, Ford pa.rts, Firestone
and Goodyear Tires and Tubes and
Accessories.
We ask you for your business, and in return we give you Service unexcelled.
We are yours to serve,
Wood Breazeale, Fair Hyams, Verne Breazeale
