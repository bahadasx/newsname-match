NEW YORK. Dec. 27 Represent
atives of the national conferen.-c
committee of railways and the four
brotherhoods of railroad employes
will resume their meetings here to
morrow for the announced purpose orT
arriving at some agreement as to the
application of the Adamson law iu
tile event it is held to be cons' itu -tional
by the United States suprtm-i
court. The meetings had been ad
journed to await the handing down
of the award in the, cise of the
switchmen's arbitration which, it was
expected, might have some bearing
on the eventual interpretation ot the
Adamson act. The railroad managers
held a preliminary meeting today.
It was intimated in ra'lroad circles
tonight that among nth"r ihings
which would le considered was an
agreement that would br;n the two
forces together in a concerted effort
to fight the president's pioposd com
pulsory arbitration legislation. The
railroads, however, are not altogether
opposed to the principle r f oornp'.tlsory
aroitration. it was indicated, :-ovld-ing
a suitable plan can be evi hel

In a gun duel with Deputy Sheriff J.
T. Murphy yesterday morning, Pedro
Salinas, the Mexican who shot Otto
Grossbienner in a midnight holdup at
Riverside Tuesday night, was seriously
wounded by the officer.
Half a dozen or more shots were ex
changed during the fight, at one time
the daring deputy who made the cap
ture bejng completely out of ammuni
tion. Grabbing a gun from Deputy
Alex Ray, who in the meantime had
arrived with reinforcements, Murphy,
who had been under fire for several
minutes, fired the effective shot. Sa
linas dropped to the ground. The bul
let entered just above the right eye and
passed through the head, lodging back
of the right ear. The man was re
moved to the sheriff's office where he
received immediate medical attention
and was removed a few hours later to
the Sister's Hospital. It is not beliived
the wound will prove fatal.
Not satisfied with his fruitless nold
up of Grossbrenner, Salinas and his
companions are alleged to have robbed
a Chinese grocer at an early hour yes
terday morning. The Chinaman re
ported the matter at once and Deputy
Sheriff Murphy was detailed to look
into, the matter. With China Dick to
act as interpreter. Murphy sought the
robbed man's plate of business on Jef
ferson street between Tenth and
Eleventh streets. Here he obtained a
description of the robbers and started
with Dick toward town. Nearing Sixth
and Jefferson streets they saw three
men walking rapidly toward the rail
road tracks. When they came to view
Murphy recognized Salinas, not only in
answer to the Chinaman s description,
but as a man with a reform school and
penitentiary record. He stopped the
automobile and called to the trio to
surrender. In response Salinas t?rew
and leveled bis gun and fired. Three
shots were exchanged.
The three men separated, Salinas
running directly across the street from
where the officer stood. Murphy, with
empty gun in hand, hailed a passing
automobile whose driver was ordered
to the sheriff's office for a' gun and
ammunition.
The residents in the vicinity hearing
the disturbance, rushed to the scene
and were commanded by .Murphy to
guard the block. One of the compan
ions of Salinas had in the excitement,
endeavored to hide from the eye of the
officer, in the colored school in the
neighborhood where he wan taken into
custodv by Murphy whi'e he was still
maintaining his watch over Salinas.
Th. confederate oved to be Albert

meantime gotten under cover in one of

surrounded, he made a ouic!? gJki'.vcv.

took effect. At that time he wjs 75

handling of the sanation alone is due

Immediately after shooting Salinas,

tity of Flores. The third bandit, who
made his escape is said to be known
by the officers, who are bending ev
ery effort toward his capture.
! every case liberal donations were of
, fi red. In fact President Lesuour stal
, ed, that although the plans tcntem
. plated only called for the people of
1 Mesa and vicinity ot contribute $25,
. 000, in case of necessity' $50,000 could
be raised. In the neighborhood of
i $lf.,000 has been voluntarily subscribed,
j The temporary plans call for an
edifice costing about $100,000. Th-.-ihurcn
will furnish $50,000 of this
j amount, the members living in Mesa
;and nearby are expected to contribute
$23,000 and the members of the church
living in Arizona, Now Mexico, Tex
as, old Mexico and Southern Calil'or
I nla. will be asked to furnish the other
Ji5,000.
If the temple is erected, thete will
be but two temples in the world oiu
side of Utah, of greater or equal size.
A new temple nearing completion in
Canada, and one about completed in
th Hawaiian Islands, will be about
the same size.
In an interview yesterday President
Lefueur stated that in spite of the
fact that the building of the temple
in Mesa, would result in a rather
heavy expense to his people at first,
that in the long run it would be sav
ing. At the present time, in order to
have a marriage ceremony , performed
according to the" ritual of the church
it is neccessiiry for the bride and
groom to go to one of the tempies
in Utah. The trip he explained cost
anywhere from J200 to $300.- The
building of the temple in Mesa, would
eliminate this trip, and would cause
tnousands of the church members to
make-the journey to Mesa.
There are in the neighborhood of
f0,000 Mormons in the Arizona, New
Mexico, Texas, Mexico and Southern
California district, who would be un
der the supervision of the Mesa
temple.
In the event of the erection of- the
temple, according to President Le
sueur, there would be a constant In
flow of people from the outside states.
It would mean that mr.y of them
who had never heard of the Salt
River valley, would come hre, and
ho doulit decide to stay. He also
stated that it would he the means of

fRepublican A. P. Leasee Wire!
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. In spite of
the wide gulf between the insistence
of the central powers for an immediate
peace conference and the forecast of
a unanimous refusal by the entente
allies to enter such a conference with
out knowing Germany's terms in ad
vance, the American government be
lieves that the negotiations in progress
are resulting in good. It was said on
good authority tonight that unless the
door to peace actually is closed by one
side or the other, President Wilson will
continue to hope that any discussion
of the subject will tend to hasten the
end of the war.
Count von Herstorff, the German
ambassador, returning unexpectedly
tonight from New York, authorized the
Associated Press to make the follow
ing statement:
"I regard the note of my govern
ment as constituting an acceptance of
everything suggested by President
Wilson in his note to the belligerent
nations of Kurope."
It was made clear at the embassy
that Germany stands ready to make
known her terms on the first day of
any conference that may be held, and
officials expressed themselves as be
ing greatly surprised at the view pre
vailing in some quarters here that the
Berlin government had failed to meet
the president's suggestions by not set
ting down in the reply the terms upon
which H is willing to make peace. The
German diplomats say President Wil
son had no intention of drawing a
public declaration concerning terms
from the central powers. On the con
trary, they think the president's sug
gestion "that an early occasion be
sought to call out from all the nations
now at war such an avowal of their
respective views a3 to the terms upon
which the war might be concluded."
has been fully met by Germany in
seeking an immediate conference with
her enemies.
The German policy upon which the
reply to President Wilson's communi
cation is bused, was outlined as tol
lows: Germany feels that the conference
suggested by it first should be com
posed of delegates from the belligerent
countries whose duty it would tie to
settle territorial terms. Once these
terms are agreed upon, representa
tives of the neutrals should be called
in to participate in consideration of
the questions of guarantees for the
future, in which neutrals are as vitally
concerned .is belligerents. These
guarantees, in the German view,
necessarily would have to do with the
freedom of the seas, limited disarma
ment, formation of a world league
of nations to enforce peace and the
establishment of an international court
of arbitration.
While there were no official advices
upon the subject, the view still per
sisted in German quarters tonight that
the note of the central jiowers might
be followed by some highly confi
dential ora.1 or written communication
to President Wilson, in which at least
broad tentative terms might lie stated.
In this connection officials noted with
interest Berlin press dispatches saying
that Ambassador Gerard, who as a
result of his recent visit to the United
States, is thoroughly familiar with the
views of President Wilson, had taken
lunch with Alfred Zimmerman. . the
German foreign minister, and probably
discussed the peace situation with
him.

measures for commercial use in the
United States and also of the "day

day by speakers in different sections
of the convention of he American As
sociation for the Advancement of

An unusual opportunity is afforded
at present to make the metric system
the American, as well as the interna
tional language of commerce, asserted
George r . Kunz, president of the New
York Academy of Scierrce.
"For the effective development of our
trade, he said, "it is most urgent that
all foreign catalogs and publications
issued hy our manufacturers should
hafe all dimensions expressed in met
ric as well as in English terms of
weights and measures."
The demand for war materials, he
added, had forced the introduction of
the metric system in many factories. A
permanent organization to urge the
adoption of the metric system was
suggested by Henry V. Arn" of Mont
clair. X. J., professor of chemistry in
the collee-e of pharmacy at Columbia
University.
"It is high time for this countrv to
throw off the shackles of an Eliza
bethan set of standards and add our
110.000,000 people to the 437.000.000 al
ready using the metric system." he as
serted ,
Urging the merits of the "daylight
saving" plan, Marcus M. Marks, pres
ident of the Manhattan borough, said
il would srive more time for recreation,
improve the nubile health, and that it
was estimated it would save $73,000,000

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 27. Cross
examination of Lieutenant G. W. von
Rrincken, German consulate attache
on trial with Consul General Franz
Ropp and five others for conspiracy to
djnamite entente munition shipments
in 1915, brought out today that von
Uiincken received but $150 a month
from the consulate, although Louis J.
Smith, whom the defense claims was
ven Brlncken's subordinate received
from $250 to $300.
Smith, as a government witness,
previously testified that he was paid
by the consulate to blow up trains, tun
nels and ships on Puget Sound and in
Canada. The defendant consul general
and aides have insisted that he was
merely an investigator for them.
L'nited States District Attorney John
W; Preston, after inquiring scarchingly
inlo von Brincken's financial affairs,
said:
"Is it not true that you conspired
with .1. H. van Koolbergen, an absen
tee defendant in this case, to blow up
those shipments and to divide the
money
"Absolutely no," von Rrincken re
plied. That van Koolbergen, whom the de
fense alleges to be a spy, sent by the
Rritish consulate here to involve the
German consulate in legal difficulties,
was a person with tw distinct na
tures," was stated by von Rrincken to
day. He told me he was the son of a
Count Dumouceau of Holland, exiled
fr marrying a Swiss woman beneath
hi;i rank," von Urincken testified. "We
had the pleasant social relations. Ke
took $200 from me to invest in a mag
nesite mine in Canada. With his wife,
he chaperoned my fiancee and myself,
buying $25 worth of champagne, and
making me pay him for it. While he
was in Canada in 1915. we corre
sponded a-s 'bob' and 'Jack' and he
asked me as a fellow nobleman, to look
after his wife."
Yon Rrincken is understood to be a
member of a German baronical family.
Later van Koolbergen undertook to
sell two mules for me from my ranch,
and he absconded with the money.
Then I knew him for a scamp. But I
had always suspected him, von Rrin
cken concluded.
Van Koolbergen, one of the seven
defendants with Ropp, von Rrincken,
Smith, Vice Consul E. H. von Schack,
C. C. Crowley, a detective, and Crow
le's secretary, Mrs. Margaret W. Cor
nell is at present in Canada.
The prosecution sought today to
show that all sums forwarded by von
Rrincken to van Koolbergen were real
ly consular funds. . Von Brincken's
bank account and checks were aired
in court' to show that his own means
were more slender than he claimed.
C. Ci Crowley, whom Smith has
charged with aiding him to try to blow
up ships and trains, will take the stand
tomorrow.

EL PASO, Dec. 27. Krancisco Villa's
forces are preparing to attack Chi
huahua City and Juarez s;multaneously
in an effort to establish railroad traf
fic between the border ard Torreon, it
was said late today by a man known
to be close to Villa .
A Mexican refugee who arrived here
today from Torreon also affirmed that
Villa was preparing to move north
with a column of approximately 5.000
men in order to attack Ch:huahua City.
He said another force of 500 Villa fol
lowers wjjs reported to have been yes
terday at the Calderon ranch, B5 miles
southeast of Juarez.
Skiimishing between the rebels at
Calderon and the de facto troops
which left Juarez yesterday for Chi
huahua city was reported here late
today but could not be confirmed in
Juarez. The Villa forces southeast of
Juaitz aie commanded by Colonel
Manuel Ochoa and Colonel Mariano
Tamez, according to a deserter who
arrived at the border here yesterday
from the Calderon ranch. He said
the Vila followers were all well armed,
mounted and had a plentiful supply of
food. They were said to have been
sent north to take Juarez as soon as
Villa started his attack on the state
capital.
It is not believed here that Villa
has any direct tactical connection with
the operations reported from the east
ern military zone near San Luis Potosi,
Tampico and Monterey, but General
Carrera Torres and the Cedilla
brothers are said to be operating in
that section under the banner of Villa.
The occupation of San Luis Potosi
