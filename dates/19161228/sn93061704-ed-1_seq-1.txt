FARMERS' AND
HOME MAKERS'
AT COLLEGE
Short Course to be Given at
State College
WEEK Of JANUARY
Sth to 13Lh, 1917
Program will be of Special Inter
est to Farmers
The Farmers' and Home Makers'
Week has been arranged for January 8
to 13, 1917, by tht New Mexico Agri
cultural College. During this week
there will be special lectures, discus
sions, demonstrations and round table
talks for the farmers and their wives.
Matters of interest to farmers, stock
growers, horiculturaltist, dairymen and
ladies will be discussed. Farmers will
be urged to ask questions and these
will be answered by specialists and the
reasons for the answers explained.
'The program is arranged jointly be
tween the State College and the De
partment of Agriculture of the United
States. A few of our people attended
these classes last year and profited
largely thereby. There ought be a
score or more from this immediate vi
cinity this year. Reduced rates have
been arranged by the railroads. Take
a receipt from your agent when pur
chasing your ticket and secure a re
duced rate on the return trip. The
whole week's expense, including board
and room, will not need exceed twenty
five dollars. Take a week's vacation
and Bpend it at the College at Mesilla
Park, where you will not only enjoy
the week, but where you can secure in
formation on questions that have vexed
you. If requested in advance, rooms
will be reserved. Write the Extension
Service, State College, New Mexico.

Jo Build Garage
C. L. Burt expects to begin work on
a new building on the corner lot now
:cupied by his residence, soon after
the first of the year. It will be occu
pied by the Mountainair Garage, being
constructed especially for that purpose.
The structure will be 50x80 feet, with
cement floor throughout. There will
bi office rooms, oil room, supply room,
Lidies room, nd an office room for
Mr. Burt. At the rear of the building !
will be a workshop 15x50 feet. In all
probability the building will be frame,
p?bble-dashed, but this has not been
jte'ded definitely ae yet.

Mrs. Corinne Harris, .. .2,000 "
Aileen Roberson, 1,700 "
The prizes were awarded according
to the count, Miss Hazel Doyle receiv
ing the first prize of $25.00; Miss Lois
Hollon, second, $15.00; Miss Mabel Sel
lers, third, $10.00; Miss Fairy Arnett,
fourth, $5.00; Misses Mabel Hine and
Josephine Capt tying for fifth place,
the prize of $5.00 was divided equally
between them.
The Independent desires to thank the
young ladies for the interest they took
in the matter of securing subscriptions
and feels that the advertising received
by the Independent through their ef
forts is well worth the expense.
Christmas Exercises
On Monday night the Sundayschool
had its entertainment at the Chapel.
In spite of the stormy weather, which
interfered with the drilling of the child
ren, a good program was rendered, the
little folks proving their interest in the
work. Every number on the program
was appreciated by the large audience,
from the "Merry, Merry Christmas
Everywhere." of little Meryl Putsch
to the singing cf the young people.
Old Santa made his appearance at
the close of the program, and distri
buted sacks of candy nuts and fruit to
all the little" folks, and found some
presents on the tree for quite a num
ber of others as well.
At the Schools
Exercises appropriate to the Christ
mas Season were held in both Mils
Hoyland's and Mrs. MeNeese's rooms
at school last Friday afternoon. Both
rooms had been decorated by teacher
and pupils, and a small tree had been
arranged in Mrs. MeNeese's room.
Here, too, the children had written in
vitations to their parents to visit the
school and attend the exercises. Sev
eral of the patrons were present as a
result. As a part of their art work
the children of both rooms had pre
pared calendars, beautifully water
colored as gifts to their mothers. Old
Saint Nick made his appearance, leav
ing each of the little folks a bag of
candy nuts and fruit.
Finds Turkey on Door Step
On opening the front door on Sunday
morning, Mrs. R. E. Farley of Albu
qoerque was surprised to find a package
from which escaped most savory odors.
Investigation showed it to contain a
roast turkey, all ready for the table
and a large toothsome cake. Whence
these good things had come was not at
once apparent. A little fairy has
whispered to us that perhaps Mrs. Far
ley might be enlightened had she known
how many turkeys roosted in Mrs. Hoy
land's poultry house before and ;:fter
Cnristmas, and how surprised Mr. Oime
wasi when he learned what a great
ruantity of good things are supposed
t have gone into the cak that graced
the Orme table on Christmas Day.
EARIRS MAKING
GOOD PROGRESS
I FALL PLOWING
County Agent Harwell Shows Advantages to
be Gained thereby
During the past two weeks trips
over the county have disclosed the fact
that wintr plowing is making good
progress. While the area plowed at
this time in individual fields is not ne
cessarily large, it shows that the right
idea is being incorporated by the far
mers. Practically ninety per cent, of
the people interviewed had either be
gun plowing or were planning to do so
in the very near future. , This state
ment holds as true in the Spanish
American districts of the Foothills as
it does throughout the central portion
of the Valley.
Tractors are beginning to play an in
teresting part in the program of fall
and winter plowing. Several purcha
ses of machines have been made re
cently with the sol idea of putting
them to this use. Our labor problem
is getting to be acute. It seems to be
impossible to get men to assist in plow
ing the large areas which will go in
next year's crops.
Most of the conditions for plowing
are ideal, and permit of unusually deep
plowing, where the necessary horse
power is available on the farm. Judg
ing from various conversations with
farmers, the idea of what constitutes
deep plowing in this county is not very
well settled. In some instances 4 to 6
inches was called deep plowing; in oth
er instances, 6 to 8 inches seems to be
the proper definition. Our plan is to
recommend plowing to a depth of about
7 inches, with a gradual increase in fu-
ture seasons. This furnishes the basis
for good winter storage of moisture, by
offering the necessary capacity. Some
writers contend that the amount of
mnintiire which can be stored in the
ground, is practically proportionate to
the depth of plowing; that is, in a giv
en season, a 4-inch plowing would store
only one-half as much moisture an is
stored in ground when plowed to a
depth of 8 inches. While we do not
claim that this statement is altogether
true, it is at least worthy of considera
tion. Undoubtedly larger amounts of
moisture cai be stored in deeply plowed
g.-our.d than in shallow plowed ground.
If we are io seriously consider our next
year's interest, we must necessarily
provide as early as possible for our
moisture. There is nothing particular
ly new about this statement, though
the benefits to be derived from its ap
plication are sometimes overlooked.
The manner in which deep plowing
furnishes more storago capacity for
moisture is found in the following:
When the soil is turned deeply and left
in the rough state, it is more suscepti
ble to fully thawing after a freeze, be
cause of the deeper penetration of
warm air, and the freer circulation of
the same. Thus it will be seen, that
at the time our winter snows melt, the
moisture is able to penetrate the spa
ces and crevice3 and become absorbed,
thereby bringing evaporation to the
minimum. The snowfall is likewise
i
! less subject to blowing, and is held in
j the field where it can accomplish the
! most good. Contrast this method with
the method now practiced by some of
; our farmers, who leave the field as it
remains after harvest . until warm
weather opens in the spring. Upon the
' first serious drop in temperature the
s il lreezes. Being protected by a thin
blanket of more or less loose dry soil,
it remains in a frozen state throughout
t .e winter. Following snow fall, when
tie melting period arrives, we notice
j that instead of penetrating the soil,
fchis moisture penetrates only to the
I frozen earth under the blanket, and
thereafter forms into a vapor cloud as
it evaporates from the puddles of wa
ter on the surface, or is drawn up
through the now compact blanket
through capillary attraction. We lose
most of it. Unless the period of warm
weather lasts for some time, the light
snows have, to all practical purposes,
done us no good. On such fields blow
ing and drifting is decidedly evident.
Aside from the matter of the conser
vation of moisture, plowing through
the fall and winter months is very ad
vantageous. The weathering of the
soil in this manner makes more availa
ble plant food. In fact, this weather
ing is the chief factor in the formation
of plant food. Also the humus, which
rests principlly in the upper few in
ches of soil, is distributed to a greater
depth and deeper root growth is conse
quently encouraged. Any litter which
may cover the field is placed in such
position that it may readily rot and add
materially to the plant food in the soil.
Vegetable matter on the surface of the
ground oxidizes readily, and to a cer
tain extent its most useful elements are
lost to the plant world.
The matter of insect control furnish
es a very desirable object for fall and
winter plowing. This is a preventa
tive measure, and as most of us have
come to realize, it is the true attitude
to. have in combating insect pests.
The first thing to do, where possible,
is to eliminate the trouble through pre-
j vention. This is the cheapest and most
satisfactory course to follow. The cure
is of necessity of secondary importance
This phase of the question has been
previously discussed and should be well
understood. Our losses from the cut
worm during the last two years should
furnish a most conclusive argument for
fall and wintei plowing.
The one objection most commonly
met in advocating fall and winter plow
ing is that, in the opinion of some.more
blowing of the soil in the spring is like
ly to occur. This opinion is hardly like
ly to be borne out in experience. We
can find very little justification of the
same by talking to men who have had
fall plowing experience, either here or
elsewhere. Assuming that the spring
work be the same in either case, it
seems unreasonable to believe that the
field which now remains with the loose
mulch on the surface, which was left
by the last cultivation and harvesting
of crops, can be subject to less blowing
than the fields which have been fall
plowed and left in the rough. Weather
ing of the soil on the smooth fields also
takes place, and we find the light loose
particles of earth which are responsi
ble for filling up about our fences and
roads where obstruction is offered,
when the spring winds blow. Even at
present clouds of dust are noticable
from these fields, while the fall plowed
fields are at rest.
Fall and winter plowing is now prac
ticed in practically every successful
district where crops are grown under
our conditions. ,It seems mo3t likely
that our advance along these lines has
been retarded rather by the lack of
horse power and funds than a sincere
question of the principles involved.
To the new comer this subject is im
portant, and should receive earnest
CDnsitleration. If thid statement of the
case is questioned, it is suggested that
the people most successful and experi-
. enced be closely questioned before the
matter is passed. Investigation will
bear out the above. 1

RANGER PUTSCH TRANS-
: MIRED TO TIJERAS
Ray King to Take Charge of
Local Station
L. J. Putsch, who for some time has
been in charge .: of the local ranger
station of the .Manzano National Forest
has been transferred to the Tijeras
Station on. the east side of the moun
tains, and is to take up his residence
and work there January 1st. Not only
the people of Mountainair, but all the
residents .of this portion of the county J
hate to give upthe Putsch family. As
an officer, Mr. Putsch has made, friends
of all with whom he has. had dealings.
Always courteous and every ready to
give information desired, he has de
fended the rights of the government
without tramping on the toes of tne
homeseekers and stockmen. The whole
family, including Lorinne and Meryl will
be missed from amongst us, especially
in church and Sunday School, where
they have taken prominent part.
The change is in the way of promo
tion, and we wish for Putsch many
more such, until he shall have reached
the topmost round of the ladder. His
successor here will be Ray King.
Bill Reported out of Committee
Washington, December 21. The na
tional prohibition constitutional amend
ment, materially altered from the form
in which it was reported to the House,
was ordered favorably reported by the
Senate Judiciary Committee today by a
vote of 13 to 3. Senators Culberson,
Reed and Brandegee voted against it.
As reported by the Senate Commit
tee the resolution would read:
"The sale," manufacture or transpor
tation of intoxicating liquors within,
the importation thejeof into and expor
tation thereof from the United States
and all territories subject to the juris
diction thereof for beverage purposes,
are hereby prohibited.
"The Congress shall have power to
enforce this article by all appropriate
legislation. This article shall not be
construed to abridge the power of the
several states to enforce state prohibi
tory laws."
Automobile Etymology
, ,
The Cleveland Plain Dealer, speak
ing of the use of foreign words by
American manufacturers to describe
American-made products, says that
automobile terms are almost all im
ported from France, and some of these
have homely meanings in the French
that are quite unlike the rather aristo
cratic sound they have in our ears.
We talk of the tonneau, of the limou
sine, of the garage, of the chassis of
the chauffeur do we ever stop to in
quire where these words come from
and how they come to be?
A tonneau in French is a vat or tub.
That is surely a fine name to apply to
that part of the automobile in which
the passengers loll at their ease! What
is a limousine? It is cruel to be obliged
to state that a limousine 3 a rough
goatskin coat such as is worn by the
peasants of the countryside near
Limoges.
The driver of a motor car is a cut
above the driver of other vehicles. We
do not even call him a driver. We dig
nify him with the title of "chauffeur."
With fear and trembling, Ictus again
consult the dictionary. Here he is:
'Chauffer, a fireman, a robber."
Having learned in passing that "han-
ger" means a shed for a farm cart, we
shall not look up the word "garage.'
It probably means something even
more plebeian! Ex.
