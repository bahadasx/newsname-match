That the campaign for the water
and sewer bond issue for which a
plebiscite has been called for Feb
ruary 21 will be entirely along educa
tional lines is the Intention of Harry
Murray superintendent of the water
department. ; . - ,
Murray believes 'that the .citizens
will vote for the bonds if the . need
of the city for such, an issue Is clearly
put before them and to carry out this
scheme he Is having maps for the
various districts' where the improve
ments are to be puMn drawn. These
maps will be distributed among the
people and also posted in conspicu
ous places. . Slides showing where all
the new pipes are to be laid will also
be shown at the moving picture
houses.
The campaign will start the -: first
v.eek in January and from the very
start to February 21 Murray plans to
I. hold as many meetings as possible.
"Practically everybody is now in
favor of the bond issue," Murray said
tills morning. "There is some opposi
tion in the Kalihl district because the
people have been told that only 7000
feet of pipe is to be laid there. Tho
plans call for nearly 17,000 feet, of
pipe, which proves my contention that
if the plans are properly explained to
the people they will see the need of
the Issue." ', "!
A canvass of the members of the
board of supervisors this morning also
showed that they are willing to do all
they can to have the bond Issue
passed.

That t':e mbrement of local Chinese
societI and rrsinessmen to seek,
throus'i action at Washington, the ad
mission of Chinese laborers here was
pros-jejted act!ely at the national
capital Jive months azo was learned

lAKt August W. H. Hindle, who has
just lef: for Washington with Farm
Cornn, was in .Washington partly on
private business and appeared on
August ?J at a formal hearing before
a subconimittee of the louse commit
tee on territories. He represented
th-i I'n.ted Ciiintse Pf iety of llopo
1 ui li, bearing credenti:ils ' signed by
prominei.t local Chinese,, and showing
that on August 4 he was named to
represent all the Chinese' In Hawaii
on the i-'an favored.-
The lu aring before the house sub
committ?e goe fully into the re
quest by the Chinese A Ion? peti
tion, ligiied by the United Chinese So
c4ety, Vee Yap, president, was. filed,
going Into the history of the Chinese
here md dwelling on present business
and agricultural conditions. The , pe
tition conclude j in part as follows:
. "The loregoias staten etts are made
with a .iew'to endeaor,.lf possib'e,
that the gove-nment of the United
States of America, md the repuijlic
of China, can enter into a special
agreement for the territory of Ha
waii; that Chinese laborers may be
admittf?.! to the islands; that the same
privile.? be accorded to the Chinese
race as to other nati. ns of Oriental
race. -
Throughout ihe hearing It was em
phasized that the chief benefit of such
Chinese labor immigration would be
to the rice industry in the Islands.
The petition was also presented
to the house conmi.ttee on terri
tories. ' ' '
In an.i Aer to a question by Congress
man Brumbaugh, Hindle said: "The
Chinese will be bound by this agree
ment, if any of them come to Hawaii
for the purpose of labcr, never, under
any clrcamstanr.es, to enter the United
States of America.
Hindi's return to Washington, ac
companied by Farm Cornn, is be
lieved to forecast a more active press
ing of the objects set forth In the pe
tition. Local Chinese say that they
have received substantial encourage
mejit tiom Congressman Burnett,
chairman of the immigration com
mittee, and. others.'
Favor Movement
To Bring Young
Folk to Hawaii
That a concerted movement should
he started here to interest the schools
of the mainland to send their rriembers
to Hawaii, either as athletic teams or
simply as a tour of education, is the
opinion of Mayor John C. Lane, who
has become greatly interested in the
ideas expressed in recent Star-Bulletin
editorials and stands ready to aid the
work in every way possible.
"It is one' of the best means of
boosting the wonders of Hawaii that
I can think of," he said this morning.
"When these, young people return
home air they will think and talk
about for months is Hawaii and that
kind of talk, enthusiastic in the ex
treme, will do mora for Hawaii than
all the literature every printed. I
hope the matter will be taken up and
I shall be ready to help in every way
i can." ;
Berndt Strongly Indorses
. "From a promotion standpoint the
plan to bring a boatload of students
bere for a big meet In 1918, as sug
gested by the Star-Buleltin, is one of
the biggest projects that has been in
troduced," said Em 11': Berndt, chair
man of the Hawaii Promotion Com
mittee, today.
"The plan advocated in the schools
would give the students a desire for
traveL It would be a plum held up. to
them which would be more than worth
while. A trip to Hawaii would be in
the nature of a scholarship or post
graduate course. A plan to have the
students come here would receive pub
licity throughout America."
"Scholarship would naturally be bet
tered If the student were given some
trip which would be of educational
value. It is certain that a liner as
large as the Great Northern would bo
able to accommodate the students. I
can see great possibilities in the plan,"
he concluded.

CROOKED DEAL IN
OPIUM IS PROBED
BY U. S. OFFICERS
Japanese Said to Have Bilked
Fellow Countryman Out ;
of $1000
- Dftails of a "badger" game, where
in &' tins supposed to have contained
opium were used as ' nait" to secure
$10im3 from a local Japanese, and hav
ing all the earmarks of the now fa
mous Seully-Bower-M Cirath-Boggs
swindle, have Itaked out through tne
local Japanese press. The - alleged
deal is being investigated by V. S.
Marshal Jerome J. Smiddy and the
U. S. attorney's office.
If sufficient evidence is gathered
the matter will be presented to the
federal grand jury, says District At
torney S- C. Huber. : Already Huber
has interviewed a number cf persons
professing to know something about
the deal, but he says that the affair
has a number of angles "and - that it
may take some little time to bring
the matter : to a head.
A. ccording to" stories ; told by those
interviewed by the U. S. attorney,
three local Japanese arranged to sell
f0 tins of opium to another Japanese,
the consideration being the payment
of $1000 upon the delivery of the tins
and the payment of . another ? 1 000
after the recipient of the opium had
disposed of It.
Arrangements were ra3de, the story
goes, whereby the three Japanese
met the fourth at a Rouse In Kewalo
one night al)out three weeks ago. The
r0 tins were placed on the table and
the buyer , hsnded ovei $10u0. At
that point another Japanese, believed
to be a confederate of the sellers,
rushed in shouting, "Here are the po
lice, we are caught." whereupon thera
was a general scramble of the Japan
ese to get out of the room. But there,
were no police. "
,' When the Japanese who wag to buy
the opium returned to the house botn
the opium and the money had disap
peared. .Marshal Smiddy has in his
possession a tin partially filled with
opium which Is alleged to be one of
the 50 tins. It was turned over to
the dist lict attorney's office by one
of the Japanese .interviewed in con
nectlon with the deal.
BELIEVES SURVEY
A federal survey of the schools In
Hawaii is net necessary, asserts Capt.
L. G. Blackman, principal of the Ho
nolulu Military Academy and mem
ber of ;he board of school commis
sioners.. ....'''.
"There is little doubt that a fed
eral survey would be a very good
thing," says Capt. Blackman, "but I
do not think Hawaii needs it.
If there
was one, however, tne investigators
would 'e surprised at and pleased with
educational conditions as they exist
in Hawaii today. They would find
that the standard in Hawaii is higher
than )ne might expect, taking into
consideration the conditions teachers
are laboring under and the tremendous
alien population. ;
"Personally, I vdo not think the
survey is needed; but if it Is desired
it undoubiIly would be worth while.
We have notuing to hide in our
schools and the greater the publicity
regarding their- work the better it
will be Jor all concerned.
"The 'ederal government does not
know what we are doing In Hawaii in
the way of education, and for this rea
son I would welcome a survey-." .
Capt. Jlackmin thinks the expenses
of a federal survey should be met by
the legislature.
