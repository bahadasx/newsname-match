Doctor Oats Before Planting
Large acreages of oats will be
planted in Mississippi during
late December , and January, as
, it is estimated that less than
forty per cent of the oat crop
t was planted in the fall on ac
of the dry weather.
To protect next years crop
against smut which is one of the
enemies of oats, doctor the oats
Mfor this desease before planting.
In this way an increase yield of
' eight to ten per cent can be se
cured on the average Mississippi
oat field.
John M. Beal, plant patholo-
. gist of the Mississippi A. and M.
College Experiment Station, re-
cently made this statement and
is suggesting that all oats ta . be
used for seed, unless known to
be free from smut, be treated
with a solution of formalin to
kill the smut spores before they
are put into the ground.
1 The importance of this treat
l ment is shown by the fact that
' practically the only way that oat
smut may live over from year to
( year is on the grain. arid when
the seed is planted in the spring
the spore is planted with it,
both germinate at the same
i time, and by the time the green
I; sprout comes out of the ground
! the smut has a strangle hold on
; rtt. This affection does not show
lufetil-the plant begins to head
when the entire head is spoiled,
i becoming a source of infection

Don't Fail to Feed
Your Cows Liberally
To the Dairy Farmer:
in going over tne state we
find that there are a number of
farmers who are not feeding
their cows anything, giving them
the run of the fields to pick up
their living. Others are only
feeding a mall quantity of hay,
Cows which are being handled
in the above ways will soon be
dry, if not already so, and have
to be carried through the winter
on expensive feeds and will give
little or no returns for same.
This practice is a serious mis
take. We realize that feeds
which have to be bought are
very high in price but at the
same time butterfat is exception
ally high this winter which will
serve to counteract the high feed
cost. Butterfat" is now selling
for about 43 cents per pound
which is the highest we have
known it to be. At the above
price it will pay well to keep the
cows giving a full flow of milk
The farmer who has fed his cows
a full, well balanced ration has
cows which have held up in milk
flow and is coining some money
this winter. Are you getting
any of the money from this high
priced butterfat or have you let
all your cows gd dry by iot feed
ing them properly?. If you have
kept them giving a reasonably
good flow of milk yon should
give them all the good bright
your herd. Also grow a large
quantity of soy and velvet beans
to have crushed to take the place
of some of the high priced cotton
seed meal. Breed as many o
your cows as possible to freshen
in the nonths of October, No
vember and December and your
cows will make you money next
winter. L. A. Higgins, Stark-
ville. Miss.
Calomel Today,

Colomel salivates! It's mercury
Calomel acts like dynamite on a slug-

to your druggist and get a 50 cen
bottle of Dodson s Liver Tone, which
is a harmless vegetable substitute for
dangerous calomel. Take a spoonful
and if it dosen't start your liver and

straighten you up better and quicker
than nasty calomel and without mak
ing you sick, you just go back and
get your money.

I told my husband I
a bottle of Tanlac he
said 'You might as well throw
your dollar out in the street, but
if you want to try it I will get
you a bottle.' He did get it,
and when I had finished taking
it he went straight to the drug
store and got another bottle, for
he saw the wonderful good it
had done me, was convinced it
was a grand medicine, and was
mighty glad to pay out another
dollar," said Mrs. G. R. Burgin,
of 214 Second street, Birming
ham. V
"Since I began taking Tanlac"
continued Mrs. Burgin, "it looks
like every time I look in the mir
ror I am heavier, and no wonder
for I went from 80 pounds to 103
a gain of twenty-three pounds.
It took jr?.t five bottles of Tan
lac to do ' this for me. Besides
it has changed me from a sick,
rundown, worn-out and nervous
wrecK into a neaitny woman,
and now I feel like living.
"Really, I had gotten so weak
I couldn't hardly lift a scuttle of
coal to the fireplace. My kid
neys were all out of shape. 1
was in too nervous to sleep and
my stomach was all out of order.
I was in this very condition
three long years. I was losing
ground every day, and lost
weight until I was almost a liv
ing skeleton. I had about des
paired of ever seeing a well day
again, tor no kind oi medical
treatment seemed to help mat
ters in the least. Finally, I got
practically helpless.
If anybody would have told
me there was a medicine on
earth that would increase my
weight twenty-three pounds I
would have thought them crazy
but as sure as I am alive today,
Tanlac did it for me and only
five bottles at that.
"It looks, like every day th; t
am stronger and feel better,
have a good appetite, and en
joy everything I eat Before
began taking Tanlac I couldn't
eat hardly anything without be
coming , nauseated. I , sleep
sound and am rid of nervousness
My kidneys bother me no longer.
To tell you the truth. I don't
feel like the same person at all
since laniac straightened me
out."
Yes, Tanlac is the greatest
medicine on earth," said Mrs.
Burgin's father, who entered!
her this bottle. If her appetite
picks up much more she will
come pretty near eating us out
of house and home. I guess she
has starved long enough and it
does me a lot of good to see her
eat heartily."
