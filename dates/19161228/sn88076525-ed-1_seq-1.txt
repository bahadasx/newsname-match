Washington, Dec. 26.—Approved by

by'which the United States will ac
quire tiie Danish West Indie&, opens
tiie way for a prompt exchange of rat
ifications between tiie two govern
ments and consumation of negotiations
that have been in progress intermit
tently since'the civil war.
The United States Senate already
has given its approval, and as soon as
the formal exchanges have taken
place the administration will press
measures in congress appropriating
the purchase price $25,000,000, and
providing for the institution of an Am
erican territorial government on the
islands.
American naval strategists for years
have regarded possession of this little
archipelago, lying 50 miles east of
Porto Rico, as absolutely necessary to
prevent any European poorer from ac
quiring it, and moreover to establish
there a great naval base and coaling
station for tiie United States fleet.
Foreign interference having been
"credited with upsetting at least once
in the past plans for acquiring the
uplands, negotiations this time were
conducted with the utmost secrecy.

While co-operative stores' in the
United StateH are relatively pnsuc
cesSful as compared with typical c^.
operative, stores in European countries
the lack of success is not due' to the
failure of the underlying principles of
such entehri8es to hold goods -a
Am^riqi, but to the busiiaess^methods
generally followed in such undertak
ings in this~ country. This conclusion
luurbeen reached as a result of a sue

the Office til Markets and Rural Or

mant^mente, inadequate accoiniiing
and auditing lack.of !(Mperation, poor

T^EIE DRESSING PRECENTAGE.
There is considerable difference in
the dressing, preccntage of different
class as sof livestock, Some of this
differisncke comes from the fact thcit
a different basis is used in figuring
for the different dasses. In the case
of tfeo hog tiie hidc?is left on aid th^
varies from 65 to 85 per cent an
rage of 75 per cent. Cattle vary from
48 to 70 per cent with an average of
53 per cent. Sheep dress out 44 per
cent to 56 per cent with an average
of 48 per cent.
The variation in the dressing pre
centaga for the same kinds of live
stock is,due to the animal being fat
or lean and to the amount of fill or the
amount of feed and water in the in
testines when butchered. In cattl

WILLEMS STARTING
ON LONG TRIP
Special Foreign Representative of
Dodge Brothers Makes Long
Jumps to See Dealers.
E. G. Willems, special foreign repre
sentative of Dodge Brothers, is about
to start on a little juant that will carry
him to the far east, including Manilla
and other island points and eventually
to Australia and New Zealand.
Mr. Willems is apparently trying to
set a traveling record. During the
past year he has traveled more than
50,000 mile, visiting the far eastern
region to which he is how rehiring,
and also South Africa and South
America.
On the portion of his journey he
made a direct jump of 10,000 miles.
Mr. Willems is enthusiastic pver the
possibilities for American can iit dis
tant lands.
"Just a few years ago the American
cars had no standing with'the foreign
buyers," says Mr. Willems, "but they
have won their way and the c£f$Nritii
good reputations in this country are
winning like prestige aboard:.
"The remarkable reception given
Dodge Brothers car when introduced
at home has been duplicated wherever
it has been shown, and the dealers ap
pointed on my trip during the past
year, all'report excellent business."
