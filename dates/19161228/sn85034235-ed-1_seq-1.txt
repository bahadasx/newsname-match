''Free and Equal.''
The author of the phrase "All men
are horn free and eiiual" was John
Lowell, a Massachusetts Jurist and
statesman, who was born In Newbury
port. Mass., In 1743.
John T.owell was the first descendant
of I'ereival Low ill, the English found
er of the famous New Eugland family,
to gain wide fame. lie wus the sou of
the first minister of Newburyport and
after studying law settled in Boston.
lie was elected to the convention
which framed the constitution of Mas
suchusetts in 1780 and was a member
of the committee which formulated
that document. He Insisted upon the
Insertion in the bill of rights of the
phrase "All men are born free and
equal" for the purpose, as he avowed
at the time, of abolishing slavery In
Massachusetts. It was largely through
hl» efforts that Massachusetts put an
end to negro slavery in 1783.—St. Louis

Have you ever sat alone in the even

books associated with the friends of
yore? the busy whirl of life i^tfiere
uot a Tpy* Iil «tun« the roil x>r old
friends and wondering where this one

moment of retrospective and Intro

wells of gratitude are opened as we
think how greatly various friends
have influenced our pathway on life's
journey; how this one or that one mny
have unconsciously determined the

We become mellowed when we think
of those passed beyond. The memory

different books, written by between
forty and fifty different authors—writ
ten aenturles apart, in different lan

forms. It is the selected literature of
fifteen centuries. It includes law, his

philosophy. It is to be read as a lit

may therefore reject a book from this
collection of literature and yet believe
in the literature. It is not like a paint-

"Any Road, at Any Time, For Any
where."
T HE boy Collie took the empty to
mato can and went for water
with which to put out the fire.
Louise and Overland Red gae
ed silently at the youthful figure cross
ing the meadow. The same thought
was in both their hearts—that the boy's
ehanc-e in life was still ahead of him
Something of this was In the girl's
level gray eyes as she asked, "Why
did-you come up here, so far from the
town and the railroad?"
"We generally don't,'' replied Over
land Red. "We ain't broke. Collie's
got some money- We got out of grub
from cornin' up here. We come up to
see the scenery. I ain't kiJdiu'; we
sure did! 'Course, speakin' in general,
a free lunch looks better to me any
day than the Yosemite. but that's be
cause I need the lunch. You got to be

of doin' anything but decomposin' my
feelin's and smokin' and wrltin' po'try."
The fire steamed and spluttered as
Collie extinguished it. Overland Red
handed the tobacco and papers to him
"About cornin' up this here trail?'' ho
resumed as the boy stretched beside
them on the warm earth. "Well, miss
it was four years ago that I picked up
Collie here at Albuquerque. His pa
died sudden and left the kid to find
out what a hard map this o!e world Is.
We been across, from Frisco to New
York, twice since then, and from Seat
tle to San Diego cn the side and 'most
everywhere in California, it bein' my
native state and the best of the lot
Ydu see Collie, he's gettin' what you
might call a liberated education, full
of big ideas—no dinky stuff. Yes. I
picked him up at-Albuquerque, a half
starved, skinny little cuss that was
cryin' and beggin' me to get him out
of there."
"Albuquerque?" queried Louise.
"Uhuh. Later, coinin' acrost the Mo
jave, we got thron off a freight by
mistake for a couple of sewin ma
chines that we was rid in' with to Bar
stow. So the tickets on the crates
said. That was hear Daggett, by a
water tank. It was hotter than settin'
on a stove in Death valley at 111 o clock
Sunday noon. We beat it for the next
town afoot. Collie commenced to give
ont. He was pretty tender and not
strong. I lugged him some, and lie
walked some. He was talkin' of green
grass and cucumbers In the icebox and
ice cream and home and the Maumee
river and a whole lot of things you
can't find in The desert. Well, I got
him to his feet next mornin'. We had
some trouble and was detained a spell
in Bnrstow after that. They con kin t
prove nothin', so they let us go. Then
Collie got to talkin' again about a Cal
ifornia road that wiggled up a hill and
through a canyon and had oue of these
here ole mission bells where it lit off
for the sky ranch. Funny, for lie was
never in California then. Mebby it
was the old postcard he got at Albu
querque. You see, his pa bought it
for him 'cause he wanted it. He was
only a kid then. Collie, he says it's
the* oulv thing hiS pa ever did buy for
him, and so he kept it till it was about
wore out from lookin' at it. But con
siderin' how his pa acted, I guess that
was about all Collie needed to remem
ber him by. Anyhow, he dreamed of
that road and told me so much about
it that I got to lookin' for it too. I
knowed of the old El Camino Real and
the bells, so we kept our eye peeled
for that particular dream road, kind
of for fun. We found her yesterday."
"What, this? Tiie road to our
ranch?"
"Uhuh. Collie, lie said so the minute
we got In that canyon. Moonstone
canyon, you said. We're restin' up and
enjoyin' the scenery We need the
rest, for only last week we resigned
from doin' a stunt in a movin' picture
outfit. They wanted somebody to do
native sons. We said we didn't have
them kind of clothes, but the foreman
of the outfit says we'd do fine jes as
we was. It was fierce—and, believe
me, lady, I been through some! I been
through some!
"They was two others In checker
clothes and dip lid caps, and they
wasn't native sons. They acted like
sons of—I'd hate to tell you what. Miss
— to the chief dollie in the show.
They stole her beau and tied him to
the k P. tracks—kind of loose, though.
She didn't seem to care. She jest
stood around chewin' gum and rol
lin' her lamps at the head guy. Then
the movin' picture express, which was
a retired switch engine hooked on to
fi Swede observation car. backs down
on Adolphuj. and we was to rush np
like—pretty fast, and save his life.
"She was a sassy little chicken with
blond feathers and u three-quarter rig
skirt. She had a regular strawberry
ice cream soda complexion, and her
eyes looked like a couple of glass al
leys with electric lights In 'em. I won
dered if she took 'em out at night to
go to sleep or only switched off the
current. Anyhow, up she rides In a
big reddish kind of automobile and
twists her hands around her wrists
and looks up the track und down the
track and sees us and says: 'Oh, w'lch
wuy has he went? W'ieh way did
Disgustus Adolphus beat it to?' And
chewin' gum right on ton of that too.
It was tough on us, miss, but we need
ed the money. .
" 'Bout eighteenth time she comes
coughin' up in that old one lung ma
chine—to get her expression right, so
the boss kept hollerin'—wliy, l gets
sick and tired. If there's anything do
in' why, I'm game, but such monkey
in'! There was that picture machine
idiot workin' the crank as if he was
shellin' a thicket full of Injûns with a
Gatling and his fool cap turned round
with the lid down the back of his neck,
and me and Collie, the only sensible
actin' ones of the lot, because we was
actin' natural, jest restin'. I got sick
and tired. Tbe next time up coughs
that crippled up automobile with the
mumps on its front tire, and she says,
'Where, oh, where has he. went?' I
ups and says, 'Crazy, miss, and can
you blame him?'
She didn't see no joke In that, so the
boss he fired us. He wasn't goin' to
pay us at that, but I picks up the little
picture machine box and I swings her
up over the track kind of suggestive
like. 'One!' said I. 'Do we get our
money?' „ ;
" 'Drop that machine!' says he, rush
in' up to me.
*" 'I'm a-goin' to,' says I, 'good and
hard. Think again while I count Do
we get our money?'
" 'You get pinched!' says he.
" 'Two!' says I. and I swings the box

" 'Hole on !' yells the boss. 'Pay the

"We got paid."
"But the bell and Moonstone can
yon?" questioned Louise, glancing back
at Boyar, grazing down tbe meadow.
"Sure! Well, we flopped near here
that night"—
"Flopped?"
"Uhuh. Let's see. You ain't hep to
that, are you? Why, we crawled to
the hay, hit the feathers, pounded our
ear—pr—went to lied! That's what it
used to be. Well, in tlic morning mo
and Collie got some sardines and crack
ers to the store and a little coffee. It
was goin' over there that we seen the
bell and the road and the whole works.
I got kind of interested myself in that
canyon. I never saw so many moon
stones lavin' right on top the gravel,
and I been in Mex too. We liked it,
and we stayed over last night, ex
pectin' to be gone by flow."
"And when yoq leave here?" queried
Louise.
"Fame old thing," replied Overland
cheerfully. "I know the ropes. Collie
works by spells. Oh, we're livin', and
that's all you need to do in California."
-And that is all-now that you have
found the road?"
"Oh, the roatl Is like all of them
dreams," said Overland. "Such things
are good for keenin' people interested
in somethin' till it's done, thats all.
It was fun at first lookin' up every
arrovo and slit in the hills till Me found
it. Same as them marriages on the
desert after that"
"Marriages?"
"Uhuh. Seeln' water what ain't there
like."
"Oh, mirages!" And lionise laughed
joyfully.
"I don't, see fto joke." said Overland,
aggrieved.
"I really beg your pardon."
"That's all right, miss. But what
would you call It?"
"Oh, an illusion, a mirage, some
thing that seems to be, but that is not."
"I don't see where it's got anything
cn marriages, llien, do you? But I
ain't generally peppermistie. I believe
in folks and things, although I'm old
enough to know better."
"I'm glad you believe In folks." said
Louise. "So do I."
"It's account of bein' a pote, I guess,'
siglicd the tramp. "Course I ain't a
professional. .They got to have a li
cense. I never took out one. not havin'
the money. Anyway, if I did have
enough money for a regular license I'd
start a saloon and live respectable.'
"Won't you quote something?" And
tbe girl smiled bewittfcingly. "Boyar
and I must go soon. It's getting hot.
"I'm mighty sorry you're goin'. miss.
You're real California stock. Knowed
it the minute I set eyes on you. Be

"Red, you shut up!"
Overland turned a blue astonished
eye on Collie. "Why, kiddo. what's
hirin' you?"
'Because the lady give us the mak

Overland grunted. "Because you're

does it? Them sandwiches hns gone to
your head. Chico. Who said she did
smoke?"
Louise, grave eyed, watched the two
men—Overland sullen and scowling.
Collie fierce and flaming.
We ain't used to—to real ladies,"
apologized Overland. "We could do
better if we practiced up."
"Of course." said Louise, smiling
"But the poetry."
"U-u>m, yes. The po'try. What'll
I give her, Collie?"
"I don't care," replied the boy. "You
might try 'Casey Jones.' It's better'll
anything you ever wrote."
"That? I guess not! That ain't her
style, i mean one of my own
thin' good."
"Oh I don't know. 'Toledo Blake.' '
mumbled Collie.
"Nope! But I guess the 'Grand Ob'
Privilege' will do for a starter."
"Oh, good!" And Louise clapped her
hands. "The title is splendid. Is the
poem original?"
The tramp bowed a trifle haughtily
"Original? Me life's work, lady." And
he awkwardly essayed to button a but
toilless coat, coughed, waved his half
consumed cigarette toward the skie,
and began:
Folks say wo got no morals—that they all
fell in the soup;
And no conscience—so the would be
goodies say ;
And I guess our good Intentions did Jest
up and flew the coop,
While we stood around and watched 'em
fade away.
But there's one thing that we're lovin'
more than money, grub or booze.
Or even decent folks that speaks
fair;
And that's the grand old privilege
chuck our luck and choose
Any road at any time for anywhere.
And Overland, his hand above his
heart, bowed effusively.
"I like 'would-be goodies,* " said
Louise. "Sounds just like a mussy
sticky cookie that's too sweet. And
'Any road at any time for anywhere'—
! think.that is real."
Overland puffed his chest and cleared
his throat. "I can't help it, miss. Born
that way. Cut my first tooth on a book
of pomes ma got for a premium with
Mustang liniment."
"Well, thank you." And Louise nod
ded gayly. "Keep the tobacco and pa
pers to remember me by. I must go."
"We don't need them to remember
you by," said Overland gallantly. Then
the smile suddenly left his face.

CHAPTER IV.
Intruder on tho Scene.
OWN the Old Meadow trail, un
| seen by the giÿ and the boy,
ode a single horseman, and
something at his hip glinted In
tho sun. Overland's hand went to his
own hip. Then he shrugged his shoul
ders and slowly recovered himself.
"What's the use?" he muttered.
But there was that in Ids tone which
brought Collie's head up. The lad
pushed back his battered felt hat and
ran Ids fingers through ids wavy black
hah- perplexedly. What's the matter.
Red? What's the matter?"
"Nothin'. Jest thinkin'." Yet the
tramp's eyes narrowed as lie glanced
furtively past the girl to where Boyar,
the black pony, grazed in the meadow.
Louise, puzzled by something famil
iar in the boy's upturned, questioning
face, raised one gauntleted hand to her
lips. "Why, you're the boy I saw out
on the desert two years ago. Weren't
you lying by a water tank when our
train stopped .and a man was kneeling
beside you pouring water on your face?
Aren't you that boy?"
"Yes!" exclaimed Collie, getting to
his feet. "Red told me about yon
too."
"Yes, it's her," muttered Overland,
nodding to himself.
"And you chucked a rose out of the
window to us?" said the boy. "Over
land said she did."
"Yes, it's her; the rose lady girl,"
said Overland. "Soifie of the folks In
the train laughed when I picked up
the rose. I remember. Some one else
says. 'They're only tramps.' I recollect
that too."
"But those men were arrested at
Barstow for murder. Uncle Walter
said."
Again Overland Red nodded. "They
was, miss. Rut they couldn't prove
nothin', so they let us go."
"We always was goin' to say thanks
to the girl with the rose if wo ever
seen her," said the boy Collie. "We
ain't had such a lot of roses give to
us."
"So we says it now," said Overland
quickly. "Or mebby we wouldn't nev
er have another chance." Then he
slowly rolled another cigarette.
Just then the black pony Boyar
nickered. He recognized a friend en
tering the meadow.
Overland lighted Ills cigarette. As
he straightened up Louise was sur
prised to see him thrust both hands
above his head while he continued
smoking placidly. "Excuse me. miss,"
he said, turning the cigarette round
with Iris lips, "but the gent behind
•you with the gun has got the drop on
me. I guess lie's waitin' for you to
step out of range."
Louise turned swiftly. Dick Ten
low, deputy sheriff, nodded good morn
ing to lier, but kept his gun trained on
the tramp.
"Just steii out from behind that
rock." said Tenlow, addressing Over
land.
"Don't know as I will," replied the
tramp. "You're no gentleman; yon
didn't say 'please.' "
"Come on! No bluff like that goes
here." said the deputy.
"Can't you see I ain't finished smok

"Come on! Stet» along!"
"No way to address a gent, you

there hadn't been a lady present?
Why. you little nickel plated, rubber
eared policeman. 1 was doin' the dou

you was learain' the taste of milk!"
"That'll lie about all for you." said
the sheriff, grinning.
"No. it ain't You ain't takln* me

you even seen me!"
"Why didn't you, then?" asked Ten
low, restraining his anger, for Louise,
In spite of herself, had smiled at Over
land's somewhat picturesque resent
ment "Why didn't you, then?"
Huh!" snorted Overland scornfully.
"Do you suppose I'd start anything
with a lady around? That ain't my
style. You're a kid. You'll get hurt
some day."
Deputy Tenlow scowled. He was a
big man. slow of tongue, ordinarily
genial and proverbially stupid. He
knew* the tramp was endeavoring to
anger him. The deputy turned to Lou
ise. "Sorry, Miss Imcharme, but I got
to take him."
"There's really nothing to hinder, is
there?" Louise asked sweetly.
The tramp glanced u,., addressing
the deputy. "Yes, even uow there is
something to hinder if 1 was to get
busy." Then he coolly dropped his
arms and leaned against the rock with
oue leg crossed before the other in a
manner sometimes supposed to reflect
social ease and elegance. "But I'm
game to take what's cornin'. If you 11
just stick me up and extract the 38
automatic I'm packin' ou my hip—
and, believe me, she's a bad Gat when
she's in action—why, i'll feel lots bet

ln' by herself, and then somebody
would get hurt sure. You see, I'm glv
ln' you ail the chance you want to take
me without gettin' mussed up. I'm
nervous about firearms anyhow.
Deputy Dick Tenlow advanced and
secured the gun.
"Now," said Overland Red, heaving
a sigh; "uow, I ain't ashamed to look
a gun in the face. You see, miss," he
added, turning to address the girl, "I
was sheriff of Abilene once In the ole
red eye, rumpus days. I have plant

I kind of owe the ones I did plant a
silent apology for lettin' this here

"You talk big," said Tenlow, laugh
ing. "Who was you when you was
sheriff of Abilene, eh?"
"Jack Summers, sometimes called

quietly, and lie looked the deputy in

Something about the tramp's manner
inclined the deputy to believe that he
had spoken the truth. "All right," said
Tenlow; "Just step ahead. Don't try
the brush or I'll drop you."
"Course you would," said Overland,
stepping ahead of the deputy's pony.
"But the bunch you're takln' orders

me alive. 1 ain't no good all shot up

"I know tiicre's a thousand dollars

Louise whistled Boyar to lier and
bridled him. The little group ahead
seemed to be waiting for her. She led
the pony toward the trail. "Did lie do

Collie.
"No." he muttered "Red's the

"What you givin' us?" said the boy,
giaueiug at her sharply.
"Nothing. I was merely imagining
something."
"Red's square." asserted the boy.
"Sheriff Tenlow is a splendid shot,"
murmured Louise, with apparent ir
relevance.
They had crossed the meadow. Ahead
of tbe sheriff walked Overland, his
slouch gone, his head carried high.
Collie noted this unusual alertness of
poise and wondered.
"Don't try the brush," cautioned Ten

ness.
"When I leave here I'll ride. Sake?''
And Overland stepped briskly to the
trail, turning his back squarely on tho
alert and puzzled sheriff.
"He's been raised in these hills,"
muttered the tramp. "He knows tho

to do it, but I guess I got to."
"Step up there," said Tenlow. "What
you talkin' about, anyhow?"
"Angels," replied Overland. "I see
'em once in awhile." And he glanced
back. He saw Cgllle talking to the
girl, who stood by her pouy, the reins
dangling lightly from her outstretched
hand.
"Snake!" screamed Overland Red,
leaping backward and flinging up his
arms directly in the face of the dep
uty's pony. The horse reared. Over
land, crouching, sprang under its belly,
striking it as he went. Again, the pony
reared, nearly throwing the deputy.
"Overland limited!" shouted the
tramp, dashing toward Boyar. With a
spring he was in the saddle and had
slipped the quirt from the saddle horn
to his wrist. He would need that
quirt as he had no spurs.
Round swung Tenlow. cursing.
Black Boyar shot across the meadow,
the quirt falling at each jump. The
tramp glanced back. Tenlow's right
hand went up, and his gun roared
once, twice.
The boy Collie, white and gasping,
threw himself In front of Tenlow's
horse. Tbe deputy spurred the pony
over him and swept down the meadow.
Louise, angered in that the boy bad

Overland shouted, relented as she saw

"Oh, I thought you were hurtl" she
exclaimed,
"Nope. I guess not. 1 was scared,
I guess. Let's watch 'em, miss." And,
forgetful of his braised and shaken
body, he limped to the edge of tho
meadow, followed by Louise. "There
they go!" he cried. "Red's way ahead.
The sheriff gent can't shoot again—he's
too busy ridin'."
"Boyar! Boyar! Good horse! Good

flashed across the steep slope of the
ragged mountain side like a winged
thing. "Boyar! Boy!"
She shivered as the loose shale, plow
ed by the pony's flying hoofs, slithered
down the slope at every plunge.
"Can he ride?" shouted Collie, wild
tears of Joy in his eyes.
Suddenly Overland, glancing back,
saw Tenlow stop and raise his arm.
The tramp cowboy swung Black Boyar
half round and, driving his unspurred
heels into the pony's ribs, put him
straight down the terrific slope of the
mountain at a ran.
