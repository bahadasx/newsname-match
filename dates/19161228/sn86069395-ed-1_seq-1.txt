Gov. Stanley has an opportunity to
play some politics just now that would
utterly route his enemies. Let him
call a special session of the Legisla
ture, but only after getting a majority
of the members to sign an agreement
to quit in 30 days, and let ' them be
called together for two purposes only
to pass the new revenue law and to
submit a state-wide amendment. If
such an amendment is of doubtful
validity it can be submitted again.
The people are determined to vote on
prohibition and we believe Gov. Stan
ley, like everybody else, will see the
necessity .of getting it out of state
politics without delay.
A judicial "ripper bill" which has
passed the senate at this session of
-congress and is in a fair way to pass
We house would force judges of the
federal court to retire when they
reach the age of 70, whether they de
sire to do so or not. The effect of
this bill would be to legislate off the

tirement within 'a .short time of a
number.of other judges who are ap
proaching their seventieth birthdays.
One of the district judges is Walter
Evans, of Kentucky, now 75 years
old.
TbeLyon County Herald says of a
young .merchant of Eddyville; a for
mer Hopkinsville boy: "Frank Tan
ner is being mentioned as a probable
candidate for Representative from the
district composed of Lyon and Mar
shall counties. He is a prosperous
It T-
.business man and a sterling demo
crat and would represent his consti
tuents with credit to himself and the
state."
According to a dispatch from El
Paso, Gen. Bell refused to allow the
ladies of El Paso to send a pie of their,
own making to each of the 52,000
soldiers on the border Christmas Day.
At first blush our inclination was to
give the General a roast 'and not
mince matters, but it may be that ho
had sampled the pies and was trying
to be kind to the boys.

THE OMMUIS POTOSI
City CommisMMers Make a
Cut in jCity Salaries
For 1917.
5 POSITIONS ABOLISHED
Duties Will Be Taken Care of
By Commissioners or
Other Officers.
The City Commissioners have de
cided to abolish fivcf salaried positions
Tuesday at a saving of about $4,000
annually. The holders of these po
sitions have already resigned to take
effect January 1st.
Engineer C. A. Cundiff and police
man Geo. W. Walker resigned some
time ago. Dr. L. A. Tate, city physi
cian, and Sergt. J. J. Cliborne have
resigned this week.
Commissioner Bassett will look af
ter the duties of the street superin
tendent and employ an engineer only
when one is needed for engineering.
The physician's office will be abolish
ed and when a doctor is.needed the
nearest one will be called in at his
regular rates. This will make a con
siderable saving. The two positions
made vacant on the police force will
be abolished and the force reduced to
ten men. A" regular patrolman will
meet the trains at the L. & N. depot
Special Accountant C. O. Prowse's
position is abolished and he becomes
City C(erk at $75, the position vacated
by L.Bj, Flack. J
The retrenchments made in the sal
ary roll by the several changes are as
follows: x
City Engineer $1,000
Police Sergeant.. ... 900
One Patrolman... 840
Special Accountant i 1,200
City Physician 200
Total of,.' $4,140
This is offset to some extent by an
increase of $1,200 in the Mayor's sal
ary, but it gives another office man
all of the time, practically taking the
place of the special man.
The proposed increases a year ago
in the salaries of the Chief and Lieu
tenant of police will be repealed.
They were never put into effect, as
the old officers were never formally
re-elected. The old salary roll for
all police will be restored. Chief
Ellis Roper will get $80 and Lieut.
W. D. Hawkins. $75 and both will
most probably be elected next Tues
day for 1917. No changes in the
police force or other official positions
are contemplated. f -
PROPOSED '
NEW I. C. LINE
Would Run Direct To ProviJ
dence, a Distance of
40 Miles.
The Evansville Courier gives a imp
of the proposed new line of the I., C.
Railroad fro'm Hopkinsville to Provi
dence. The road would run through
Webster and Hopkins counties to
Dawson Springs, 18 miles; thence on
a direct line to Hopkinsville 22 miles.
It would give Hopkinsville two I. C.
routes to Morganfield.
QUARTERLY MEETINC. -
The first quarterly meeting of the
Hopkinsvillo circuit will bo held at
Longview Methodist church Saturday
and Sunday, Dec. 30 and 31. Pre

In Case He Rejects Protocol
Believed He Could Not
Make Loan.
, Washington, D. C., Dec. 27. A re
port received at El Paso by sources
known to be close to Francisco
Villa and his government agents, says
that Villa's forces captured San Luis
Potosi Monday.
Many foreigners who loft Torreon
before Vilia attacked that town re
cently went to San Luis Potosi.
No details were available.
Carranza's reply to the protocol is
sti'll awaited.
The more general opinion among
government officials, however, was
that the Mexican executive would not
change his repeated declarations that
the American troops must be with
drawn unconditionally and that any
further discussion ofN international
subjects could not take place while
foreign troops 1 'violated the sovereign
ity" of Mexico.
If Carnrnza persists in his refusal,
there will be nothing for the members
of the joint commission to do but to
hold one last session to close up the
records and say good-byes.
, Disruption of the commission would
it is believed, make very slim" the
chances of Carranza's obtaining an
American Ioart without which those
high in his own government concede
it will be alfnost impossible for him to
continue the task of conducting an
administration beset by organized
bandits.

London, Dec. 27. Rumania con
tinues the theater of greatest activi
ties! In northern Wallachia along the
southern Moldavian border and in
Dobrudja the Teutonic allies continue
to make gains over the Russians and
Rumanians. Thirty miles southwest
of Braila the invaders have captured
the town of Filipechti, and west of
Rimnik Sarat are on the offensive.
In this latter region during the past
few days 5,500 Russians have been
made prisoners.

are still in quest of Kut-el-Amara in
which sector they have made further
advances on the right bank of the
Tigris and consolidated and extended
their positions south and east of the
town. Gassabs fort, twenty miles
southeast of Kut, a base from which
hostile Arabs had been operating
against the British, has been destroy
ed.
The British victory over the Turks
atMaghdaba, 90 miles east of the Suez

about 2,000, seven guns, a large num
ber of rifles, much ammunition and
large quantities of other war stores
were ca'ptured.
On the other fronts there have been

Buggy House of Delker-
Schmitt Co., on Ninth
Street Destroyed.
JUDGE WINFREE'S LOSS
Grocery of Ed Herndon, on
Greenville Road, Burned '
Same Night.
Three fires occurred between 7 p.
m. Uec. 'Zxj and 1:30 a. m. Dec. 26.
The most serious was on Ninth street,
only a few doors from the fire depart-'
mcnt. The buggy store of the Del-
ker-Schmitt Co. was the scene of tho
fire and it was burning fiercely on
the inside when the fire was discov
ered. Owing to the combustible
nature of the contUETand the close
ness with which the buggies and
other supplies were packed in the
small building, it burned rapidly and
the stock of buggies was practically a
total loss. The house has been closed
up and the loss has not yet been ap
praised. Ed J. Schmitt is the local
manager of the corporation. The
building is owned by Mrs. Virginia
Dade Lipscomb. The losses on build"
ing and stock are covered by insur
ance. Damages were also sustained
by the stocks of J. R. Hawkins & Co.,
groceries, and" E. Tanner, dry
goods, in the two stores adjoining on
the east side. These losses Were
caused by smoke and water and are
i t nn 1
no; so large, liicyare covered Dy in
surance.
During the fire, which was close to
Richard Leavell's stock barn, Mr.
Leavell had the 140 head of horses
and mules in the barn driven Out and
turned loose without taking time to
halter them, and they were rounded
up with considerable difficulty next
day, some of them going several
miles before they were found.
BLAZE AT JUDGE WINFREE'S.
A fire that started from one of the
chimneys in the residence of Judge
W. P. Winfree, corner of Virginia
and Sixteenth street, caused an alarm
to be turned in at 7:20 Christmas
night, but the department responded
quickly and extinguished the small
blaze with chemicals, by tearing off
a few weather-boards. The loss was
small, fully covered by insurance.
SUBURBAN GROCERY BURNED.
An alarm of fire was turned in from
First street at 7:30 Christmas night
and when the department responded
they found tho grocery store of Ed
Herndon, on the Greenville road, out
side the city limits, on fire. It was
necessary to use 1350 feet of hoscJo
reach the fire and the grocery could
not be saved. A house occupied by
a colored family close by. was also
burning and that was saved with
some damage to the roof. Her don's
loss was several hundred dollai
