luveeugauou nua ivt-port
Construction oa Alliance's new
federal building, which was suspend
ed on December 6, was resumed
again this morning wuh D. E. W.
Jimes lu cnaige ot the work for the
contractor, Geo. A. Shaul of Seneca,
Kaus. S.epnen Oiop, superintend
ent of construction tor the govern
ment, early in December filed charg
es against Mr. Jones and until the
settlement of the charges work was
suspended, on orders from Washing
ton. A telegram froai Washington to
George A. Shaul at Seneca on Wed
nesday stated: "Investigation Alli
ance, Nebraska, shows no change in
orguuizaiiou required. Resume sus
pended work, weather permitting."
Shortly arter the charges were fil
ed by Stephen Oiop, the government
sent here for investigation J. W.
Roberts of San Francisco, who Is
supervising architect of construction
and superintendent of repairs on U.
8. buildings. In view of the action
taken by the department It is pre
sumed that his report was favorable
to Mr. Jones.
A number of Alliance people re
ceived the Impression that Mr. Oiop
waa an army captain or a graduate
of the military academy at West
Point and he has been addressed as
"Captain" since coming here. On
December 7 a wire was sent from
Alliance to Richard Fourchy In
Washington as follows: "Look up
and see if Stephen Oiop is now or ev
er has been a captain in army or a
graduate of West Piont." The an
swer received on the 8 th was as fol
lows: "Your wire seventh. War de
partment says they have searched
records but find nothing to show
that your man ever was in army or
West Point but he n.lght have been
in National Guard or militia. Civil
service says he entered civil service
1907, age twenty-eight, and in it
continuously since then. Ills papers
show military service previous to
1907." - Fourchy was formerly chief
superintendent of superintendents
for this diviBion and is now counsel
for contractors at Washington.
In support of his work and actions
on the Job Mr. Jones had as evidence
affidavits from workmen who were
employed by him. Among the affi
davits which Mr. Jones secured were
the following:
"Charles JohnBon, being first duly
sworn, upon his oath deposes and
says that he is employed by D. E. W.
Jones, who has the contract for the
construction of the federal building
at Alliance, Box Butte county, Nebr
aska, and Is at present working upon
said building under said D. E. W.
Jones; that on this 23rd day of Sep
tember, 1916, one Stephen Oiop,
who. is -superintendent of construc
tion for the government of said
building did assault three or four of
the laborers working upon said
building under said D. E. W. JoneB,
without cause or authority 'and did
curse and abuse said laborers with
out cause or authority. That upon
being spoken to about his conduct he
accused said D. E. W. Jones, super
intendent for the contractor, of curs
ing and abusing his men. This affi
ant further 'deposes and says that
while he has worked under said
Jones upon said building, which has
been five days, he has never heard
-.1 r V. W Jnnni abuse or curae
his men, nor has he ever heard him
swear or curse while aout the bund
ing in any way or at any time."
. Frank Seedorf and John Young
make an affidavit in which, they say:
"Frank Seedorf and John Young, be
ing first duly sworn, upon oath de
pose and say they are acquainted or
know D. E. W. Jones by sight, who
is superintendent for contractor in
the construction of the federal build
ing at Alliance. Nebraska, aud know
by sight Stephn Oiop, the govern
ment superintendent of construction
upon said building; that the yspend
considerable time about the building
under construction on this 23rd day
of September, 1916. While stand
ing near the grounds they heard a
conversation between said Jones and
said Oiop in which said Jones in a
nice way requested said Stephen
Oiop not to curse or abuBe the men
working upon the building; that
Stephen Oiop then became abusive
to said Jor.es and cursed and abused
him and told said Jones that he
would make his work upon the con
struction of said federal building
mighty unpleasant and that he would
' get him; that they did not hear said
Jones swar or use abusive language
to said Oiop in said conversation.
Henry Young made an affidavit in
which he said: "Henry Young, being
first duly sworn upon his oath de
poses an dsays that he has worked
upon the federal building at Alliance.
Nebraska, now under construction,
since the 16th of July. 1916, and
has worked under D. E. W. Jones up
on said building; that during bis
employment upon said building he
has never heard said D. E. W. Jones,

Some fifty members of the High
School Alumni Association were
highly entertained at the Episcopal
parish house by the E. S. II. society
last evening.
After the greetings! and welcomes
were over, the H. S. 11. Theatrical
Company presented "The Circlet of

acts. The spectators followed with
breathless interest the adventures of
Sinbad the Sailor, and showed u uch
appreciation of the players' abilities.

Pato, superintendent of the city
schools, called the number of the gilt
the guest holding the corresponding
number called for his parcel. A most
amusing feature of the tree was the
effective service of the sergeant-at-arms,
Martin Nolan, '12. Mr. Nol
an, in accordance with instructions
from Mr. Pate, refused to let anyone
return to his seat without opening
his present before the assembly.
A long table heaped with the usu
al Christmas treats was then pulled
to the center of. the room and every
one feasted.
The society, as hosts and hostess

of enthusiasm that pervaded the par

Met with County Agent
On F rlday afternoon, December
22, some fifteen farmers met ' with
(he county agent at the court house
to discuss the plan of borrowing
money under the provisions of the
Federal Farm Loan Act. It was af
ter a thorough discussion of the sev
eral . factors necessary' to borrow
money that the most of those in at
tendance signified their Intention of
borrowing money from Uncle Sam on
his long-time, low-interest "proposi
tion. The matter of organization
for a National Farm Loan Associa
tion, in order to receive the benefits
of the act, was gone into carefully as
were thexther things commonly used
to frighten the public taking advan
tage of the act.
Must Have a Reason
One of the things brought out was
the fact that even though one is able
to borrow money from a Federal
Land bank for forty years with op
NEW FEDERAL FARM LOAN BANK
TO BE LOCATED AT OMAHA
Washington, D. C, Dec. 28 The
federal farm loan board yesterday
announced the following cities in
which federal farm loan banks will

Md.; Columbus, S. C; Louisville,
Ky. ; New Orleans, La.; St. Louis,
Mo.; St. Paul. Minn.; Omaha, Nebr.;

FIFTEEN FREIGHT CARS
DERAILED NEAR WHITMAN
Fifteen cars were derailed two
miles weBt of Whitman Saturday af
ternoon, about 1:30 o'clock, when a
Journal on one of the cars broke. The
loss will reach $5,000, It Is said. The
damage to the freight will probably
be fifteen to twenty per cent of the
damage to the cars. 8ome 600 feet
of track was torn up. The wreck
ing crew from here was sent to the '
scene and the track cleared by 6
o'clock Sunday morning. Passenger
train No. 44 was detoured via Brush,
through Colorado, then to Lincoln.
ASK APPROPRIATION
OF 91,500 THIS YEAR
"Experience has proven that the
only equitable way to raise the most
of the local funds for county agent
work after it Is well started." said
County Agent Seidell In a talk with
a Herald reporter yesterday, "Is by a
county appropriation. Several coun
ties in Nebraska are doing this now
and some started in with that idea
right at the beginning. Box Butte
county has been asked to appropri
ate $1,600 for the work of 1917.
This is not to raise the taxes and
,will amount to an actual one and
one-tenth cents on average dollar of
i the present tax."
tional payments, at a rate that can
not exceed six per cent and may be
considerably lower, a rate of interest
about three per cent below the aver
age for this district a year ago, that
is no reason for borrowing money
when It is not needed and when it
will not be productive. Borrowing
without a purpose Is discouraged. It
is necessary to have a definite pur
pose In mind in order to borrow
through the Federal Land banks.
. The county agent suggests that those
, who wish to avail themselves of this
, privilege should do so at once.
To Explain Act Again
The act will be briefly explained
again, at the meeting to be held Fri
day of this week, at which time
those who have questions to ask that
have not been answered before may
gain additional lnforu atlon.
Effect Already Felt
The Federal Farm Loan a ct seems
to have already been the means of
reducing the Interest rate in this sec
tion, even before it actually goes in
to effect. Many are of the opinion
that if the act can accomplish this
effect now, it certainly must work to
the benefit of the masses from now
en. The act provides a means
whereby the farmer may borrow
from the Federal Land bank up to
fifty per cent of the property and a
percentage of the Insured valuation
of the Improvements. Forty years
are allowed in whicJi to make the
payments with the right to pay all at
any interest-bearing date, except that
borrowers must take the loan for a
period or five years. Those who
want, short loans must secure them
froji other sources.
Many Interested
. It is believed the plan Is going to
be taken advantage of In this Bection
by a large number. There are many
who nre still debating and who, when
they Bee their neighbors In on the
plan, will decide to delay no longer,
and will then secure a loan and make
needed Improvements that will tend
to make their farm labors more ef-
I ficlent as well as more productive.

JOKER OR MURDERER
SENT GERM-LADEN MAIL
Letter Sent from Alliance to Denver
Woman Contained Iinnthenome

Alliance people who chanced to
read tue Denver Post of Tuesday's
Issue were shocked' when they read
a news story stating that someone ti.
Alliance had mailed a letter contaln
.ng scallngs from old sores and la
beled "smallpox germs" to Mrs. O.
vV. Holde, 2430 Humboldt street,
(Mivr. Many 'were Inclined to be

iun Postmaster Robert Graham
started an Investigation they were
compelled to accept it as the truth.
.vttuo the news story did not state
that Mrs. Holdo Is a colored women,
that la the information received
here. The postu aster has consulted
with the local police department in
an effort to locate the Joker or
would-be murderer. According to
Police Chief Jeffers there are no col
ored families in Alliance who either
uuve had or now have the smallpox,
as near as can be learned. An ef
fort Is being made to apprehend the
person who mailed the loathsome
gift, and if found it will probably go
hard with hi in.
A Herlous Matter
The Denver Post tells the story of
the receipt of the gift labeled "small
pox germs" in the following langu
age:
"Either a practical Joker with a
very distorted sense ot humor or
someone with wholesale murder in
his heart Is at large. This alleged
humorist or fiendish slayer has been

"Mrs. O. W. Holde. 2430 Hum

card, mailed froai Alliance, Nebr. In

tissue-paper envelope containing a
number of scallngs from old sores
And these were ' labeled "smallpox
germs."
"To the frightened eyes of Mrs.
Holden they looked like Just what
ney were labeled, too. And to make
matters worse, she received the mall
ed card and the deadly lnclosure
while she was attending a Christmas
dinner party. Several of her friends
handled the package before it finally
reacneu ner nanos.
"Mrs. Holden hurried to the office
of City Physician C. B. James. He
vaccinated her and turned the con
tents of the envelope over to City
uacienoiogisi Mitchell ror analysis.
"The sender. If caught, may Dlead
a practical Joke, but Uncle Sam will
hardly laugh at the thing. It's cold
and his lips are chapped. Too many
postofflce clerks, railway mall clerks
and letter carriers handle each Indi
vldual piece of mall, and Uncle Sam
iuei is Juat a bit touchy about being
asxea or expected to lug epldemic-
spreaaing ger.ns thru his mails.

on the case, and, with the assistance
of the postal authorities, are looking

Floor with J loom for All
After receiving estimate on the-
re-bulldlng and remodeling of the
Alliance Hotel bolldlng, J. M. Miller,
proprietor or the hotel and lessee of
the building, has decided that the ex
pense would be too great and ha
therefore given up the proposition of
modernising and enlarging the build
ing. 8everal months sgo Mr. Miller
purchased the corner opposite the
Alliance hotel. The Burlington ho
tel, a frame structure, now stands oa
this' corner. He has had plans
drawn and estimates made for the
construction of a four or five-story
new, modern hotel building on this
corner. The plans may be seen at
the Alliance hotel. They were drawn
by O. J. Henke, Bcottsbluff architect
The new hotel with five floors-
would have 10t rooms and be con
structed at an approximate cost of
1100.000. It would be the most
modern and up-to-date hotel In this
part of the west and would aply
care for all business which might
come to the city tor years to come.
It only four floors should be built.
there would be 17 rooms and the
building could be constructed at a
cost of $80,000. The building would
be 67 tt by 140 feet in size. The
plans call for a largo dining room
with bard maple floors, which could
be used for dancing when desired.
The commercial club could be ac
commodated with quarters prepared
especially for them on one of the up
per floors, giving the club a fine and
comfortable home.
