How Dry Is Kansas
Washington', Dec. lO.Sena
tor3 Reed of Missouri and
Thomson of Kansas this after
noon entertained the Senate
with an exchange of brickbats
over an ancient question :
"How dry-is Kansas?"
"There are more drunkards to
the acre in Kansas than- in any
other state in the" Union," Sena
tor Reed declared.
-- Senator Thompson came back
with this virtual admission :
"They "were tempted with Mis
souri liquor." '
" "If there :was any place in the
world that needed prohibition it
was Kansas'," Reed said. "The
worst thing ! can think of is a
Kansah with a quart of Bour
bon." ,
The foregoing discussion was
brought on by the consideration
of the bni to make the, District
jected the "Underwood amend
ment to submit, the proposition
to a vote of .the inhabitants of
the District by a vote of 38 to 38.
Senator Salusbury, president pro
tern, declared 'the amendment
lost. Underwood gave notice
that on account of the . tie, he
would ask another vote before
the bill is up for final passage.
An effort was made by ' Under
wood to get unanirnous consent
- to an agreements vote on the
bill tomorrow.
Earlier in the afternoon, the
Senate voted to-permit women to
vote in the referendum election
Cl then later to'Jbar from suf
.1 fce persons - who can not read
a&rite orwho are delinquent
in heh taxes, .'An (-amendment
b;'' Senator Kern .fixing strict
penalties for bribery and corrup
tion in the election was accepted.
Friday morning .-about ten
o'clock fire was discovered in the
rear of the tailor shop on Cartil
age avenue. The fire department
at. nrvrp rpsTHvnrtpH nnrl Ht
flames were soon under control.!
It seems that a quantity of gas
oline left near the stove was re
sponsible. There wfes little wind,
and the building, located as it is
between two -brick buildings,!
perhaps saved a more serious
fire.
Frank and Chas. Wood spent
'Christmas with their mother,
;Mrs. L. E. Wood, of this city.

Goyerntnent statistics
show that:
Every minute 21 persons
are accidentally injured.
Every 5 minutes one per
son is accidentally killed.
11,000,000 are killed and
injured yearly.
This means 30,000 each
day.
. Five times as many per
sons are killed and injured each year as die from natural
causes. .
Out of 20,000,000 cases of disability that occur each year
Cnly five per cent are fatal. Just think of it! Life insur
ance only covers five per cent, and Health and Accident In
surance covers 95 per cent.
Does Not the Law of Average Say Your turn is Next?

Departed
From time to time it becomes!
our. duty to record the passing
from our midst -of those who

in its infancy tbe old timers
This e.k we note the de
parture of tne who may right-
fuJjj be., called a pioneer, ope
among Mea die's first residents,

Up until a couple of years agi,
the deceased was unusually act
ive fcT one of her year?; and was

But ever, sine? tbe death -of her

lost all interest and her health
has gradually- failed. Several
days ago she suffered an attack
, of asthma, a disease from which
she has suffered for years: on
; Christmas eve, at a few .minutes
! after eleven her duties upon
learth were ended, and. the soul
..of one whose first thoughts thru
out her whole life had been of
rher family, departed.
Mary Ja,ne'Weizel was born in
West Virginia, near Wheeling,
October J8, 1839. She was mar
ried to. Robert A. Ro enoerry,
at Point Pleasant, Virginia, io
18(5. Five .children were born
to tfcis unionx The family -ame
to Kansas in the fall f 1884, and

We dislike to find fault, but.
judging from the number who
were on the scene to return the I
hose cart and ladder wagons to
their proper place, when the fire
was over, last Friday, it does J
seem that Meade needs a revival i
in the way of a larger fire de
partment. There are always i
those who are ready to run when
the fire alarm is sounded, but
when the water is turned on and
the actual work begins, the num-!
ber diminishes, and too many on-;
lookers, and not enough helpers
are to be seen; As in the case
(Friday, when the fire was out
and the danger over, two men I
were left to return the fire fight
ing apparatus to the hose house.
We have heard it stated that
some of the members of the Vol
unteer Fire Department have
resigned their positions by rea
son of the fact that they were
required to pay poll tax. This
may or may not be true, but it
would seem that when a man
volunteers his services when the
homes and business places of our
people are in danger from fire,
he should be exempt from any
obligation in the way of poll tax,
at least. Meade has one of the
best water systems along the
Rock Island, and some of the
most willing fire. fighters to be
found anywhere, but we need a
little better organization, with
fewer leaners, and more lifters.
Miss Flossie Black is spending
the holidays with her parents.
Post Card Shower,
We have been requested to ask
the friends of Isaac Covalt to re
member him, by sending a postal
card on New Year's day. His
friends Tiave arranged for a post
card shower upon that date, and
are taking this means of letting
everyone know of it. As ' our
readers all know, he hasbeen
confined to his home for the past
several months, and a little re
membrance from his ' many
friends in' Meade will most sure
ly cfieer him up. .

More Than Million Cows
That the Kansas farmers re
coming to a better appreciation
of ;the milk cow is indicated by
the increased 'number of dairy
animals in the state, as reported
to the state board of agriculture
by assessors.
The enumeration this year,
which has just been compiled,
shows that Kansas has for the
first time more than one million
milk cows. The exact number is
1,077,067, a gain of 115,786 over
the count of 1915. Since 1910 ,
the increase is 435,497, or 67 per
cent. Butler leads all other coun
ties with 19,623, followed by
Barber, Dickinson and Reno with
more than 18,000 head each.
Commenting on this showing
J. C. Mohler, secretary of the
board, said:
"This is a most encouraging
sign. It means more farmers
are engaging in this high type
of husbandry. Dairying is one
of the marks of enlightened pro-
gressive and prosperous agricul
ture. The dairy method of farm
ing more nearly eliminates
chance as a factor in the farm-)
er's irfcome. , The dairyman is a J
soil builder, rather than a soil!
roblber. He is conducting a farm i
factory, converting the raw ma-
tefials of his farm into finished (
products, without seriously de-
pleting its resouces."

employed, at the Rock Island de
pot for several months, has been
