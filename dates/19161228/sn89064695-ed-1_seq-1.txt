The Society of American
Indians and the Indian
The Quarterly American Indian
Magazine in its last issue contains
some very spicy debates between
Dr. Montezuma, the noted Apache,
and Rev. Sherman Coohdge, ex
president of the society.
Doctor Montezuma paid his re
spects to the Indian Bureau as us
ual in his straight-forward and
drastic way.
Mr. Coolidge undertook to de
fend the Indians, who are employ
ed by the Indian office, by saying
\tbat an Indian who is employed
by the govern merit can be loyal to
his race as well as to the Indian
bureau of the government.
In reply to this Doctor Monte
zuma made the following state
ment: "A hireling only that is to
do service. As' a hireling he is
not himself, he cannot be. There
are Indians in the service, and
tha is what I m trying to
pi^S!a8thipr
w& ^&fc
do anything that will embarass
the Indian department, not only
the whites but everybody. If I
went into the Indian service I
would shut my mouth on a good
many things
The statement made by Doctor
Montezuma is as true as gospel.
^There is not a member of an Inular
dian tribe who resides on an Incan
dian reservation who does not
know that an Indian who is em
ployed in the Indian service can
look forward to immediate dis
missal if he undertakes to criticise
an Indian superintendent even if
the latter commits a violation of
United States law.
This has be^n the history of the
policy which has been followed by
the Indian bureau for fifty years
and more, and more especially dur
ing the past fifteen or twenty
years.
If an Indian wishes to retain his
position in the government Indian
service he simply becomes a ma
chine, and must wink at all kinds
of frauds that are perpetrated up
-on Indian tribes even if this comes
within his knowledge.
Jt. is true that a few, but very
few, Indians.have shown their in
depeLdfe-nce by not hesitating to
expose the fraudulent acts of some

It has been the policy of the In

that Doctor Montezuma is right in
his contentions.

People who are attracted to the
Indian temperment speak of his
qualities as a poet and a dreamer.
These traits have never been pop
in this country. The Ameri
people believe that paets
should saw wood. However the
Indian has had two qualities that
are much admired among us.
These are courage and endurence.
The red man was never charged
with being devoid of these traits.
In time he will make these
characteristics fit in American
daily life. Heroism and endur
ence are great qualities when they
are transferred from the ambush
and the war path to the corn field
and the cattle ranch. Hayward

The last vestige of the old Flan
dreau Indian Day School at Flan
dreau, S. has disappeared from
its original site in town, and the
orounrls have been donated by the
ground.
The school was originally opened
in 1876 by the Board of Presby

held recently indicate better days
for the red man. The claim is
made that there are now more In
dians in the country than at any
previous tune since the bureau was
established. Their death rate has
been reduced by a health cam
paign, and the birth rate is in
creasing. The race now owns
900,01)0,000 worth of property.
These figures look rather im
pressivp, until one reflects that
their wealth is in real estate, hand
ed down from the time when you
bought land with Wampun. How
ever the fact that the population
is increasing shows that the red
man is no longer pining his heart
out in the country of the pale
face.
When he drops his war oaint
and feathers, and changes his
name from "Peter the Bull th it
Lies Down" to Peter Bulldown, a
metamorphosis has taken place.
The greatest obstacle in the way
of the Indian's advance has been
his hereditary indolence. He came
by it honestly from his forefathers.
Many white men feel the same
way. A man of high intellectual
gifts remarked that he would

Launched.
The "Sisseton Indian Farmer"
is the name of anew Indian paper
at the Sisseton Indian
School, at SisvSeton, S. D., the first
number of which has just arrived
at our desk. E. D. Mossman,
superintendent at Sisseton, is theand
editor of the new hheetand has the
following to say in his prospectus
which is published in the first
issue.
"With this first issue of our
paper 1 suppose it is proper that
we declare our reasons for launch
ing it upon the sea of journalism.
'As stated above, this paper is
published in the interests cf the
Sisseton Indians and we will try
to keep this idea plainly in view
as long as the paper is edited by
us.
'There are many things that it
is desirable that all the Indians
should know but there has been no
medium through which we could
communicate with all of them at
the same time unless a large
amount of work was done in send
ing typewritten letters and circu
lars to them.
'We hop-* with the new paper in
the field to communicate to the In
dians through the paper, the cir
cujiuvs and instructions from the
bers of the tribe are particularly

interested
It is also expected that the
paper will contain all of my orders,
regulations and notices which are
of interest to the employees and
memoers of the tribe.
'The paper will be published
only in English because nearly all
of our people read Engli-h.
'The advertising in this paper is
spoken of elsewhere, and we mere
ly mention it here simply to state
that it is necessary to secure this
advertising matter to pay for the:id
publication of the paper by
therenioied
printer.
'it is not a money making scheme
we will be glad if the paper
will support itself.
'Neither are we starting this
paper so that we will have more
work, because the employees are
all worked to the limit at the
present time.
'We hope that this paper will be
a medium of exchange for ideas
among the members of the iribe
and keep the members of one part
of the reservation informed as tobeautiful
what is going on in the other dis
tricts.
'It is also desired to stir up theSoon
interest in the health campaign
which the Indian Office is waging
against diseases among the In
dians.
'We desire also to use the paper
to forward our efforts toward se
curing more diversified farming
among the Sisseton people.
'We hope also to use tho paper
to interest our white neighbors in
what we are trying to do."
