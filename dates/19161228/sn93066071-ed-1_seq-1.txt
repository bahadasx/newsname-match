SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION.
The matter of general education In
this country lian reached a point where
inore anil serious consideration will
have to be given the question of con
solidatlon of rural schools.
Of one fnct there win be no question,
our country hat reached n period In Its
history when Its people must be Riven
elucatlon. Ignorance and Illiteracy
are no longer compatible with twenti
eth century life.
Every person at all familiar with
conditions under which the country
schools aro maintained, knows that
under these conditions' It is absurd to
even hope that r. child may obtain a
competent education therein. With a
school house to every two or three
miles 6f territory, dividing up the at
tendance and. multiplying the number
of teachers, two unavoidable conse
quences result-T-terms are shortened
and inferior teueliera aro employed.
It is a fact, patent to all intelligent
observers, that toattalnginy proficien
cy in teaching, the person mustchooso
this as his or her life work, and must
labor to equip themselves for efllolent
service. To this end there must be
sulllclent Inducement. The utter ab
surdity of a three or four months term
at ?.'." or $30 per month furnishing that
inducement, is plain to all
One of the greatest possible detri
ments to the proper education of the
child Is a.-t incompetent teacher, and
that the conditions just described are
thus Injuring the desired results of a
longer term and more competent
teacher.
As to just how consolidation may
best bo accomplished, must be left al
most entirely to local conditions to do
termlne Tho public conveyance plan
Is working well In many sections. The
development of good roads is also hav
ing a beneficial effect and aiding In the
solution, nut, as we stated, this is
entirely a local question and must bo
worked out locally,
'The Important point Is that the. peo
ple bo brought to see tho absolute ne
cessity for sufficient consolidation of
our xchools to accomplish the desired
results. Given this conviction, we
have no fears but the solution of the
problem of ways and means will bo
worked out.
SLOAN'S LINIMENT EASES PAIN.
Sloan's Liniment is the first thought
of mothers for bumps, bruises and
sprains that are continually happening
to children. It quickly penetrates and
soothes without rubbing. Cleaner and
more effecivo than mussy plasters cr
ointments. For rheumatic aches, neu
ralgia pain and that grippy soreness
after colds, Sloan' Liniment Rives
prompt relief. Have a bottle handy
for bruises, strains, sprains and all ex
ternal pain. For the thousands whose
work calls them outdoors, the pains
and aahes following exposure are ro
lieved by Sloan's Liniment. At all
Druggists. Mo.

HAPPY
NEW YEAR
TO YOU
Following our usual custom, we are is
suing only the .advertising section of
TheHeraldthis week, giving the office
force and the editor, as well, little
Holiday vacation and getting things in
line for better and more luork during
the New Year which is just dawning.
What 1917 will mean to most of us,
depends largely upon what we make it.
Let us all resolve to make it the BEST
year of our life from a point of use
fulness, charity and right living. If
we do this, we will have done the thing
which will not only benefit us most
ourself hut those .about us, and the
town and community will be the better
for our efforts. We wish for all that
the year 1917 may be the best that you
have ever known and the worst that you
ever will know.

fast flooding tho land with n lot of in
competent) Is plain to nil. And tho
child is the sufferer. Where he should
be rightly and thoroughly grounded In
all tlieUWerent branches, in roality he
frequently has but an Imperfect, nnd
sbmef lines even a wrong groundwork
to build on, the results of which are
Men In the woefully Inefficient liveB of
so many of our people.
Again, it Is too plain even for argu
ment, that no community can educate
Its children on three or four month
terms of school, Practically tho entire
accumulations 'of the abort term aro
forgotten during the long vacation.
There are, then, two Indisputable
requisites to the proper education of
our rural population competent In
structors and school terms sufficiently
long. Of courso, in tho densely popu
lated districts, schools can be main
tained of sufficient size to guarantee
the length of term, as this depends al
most entirely on tho per capita, and
given the term, with an adequate sal
ary, the competent teaoher Is easily
secured and tho children's best inter
etts conserved.
But In the sparsely settled districts
this js not the case, and here arises the
Imperative need of consolidation re
ducing the number of schools, thereby
increasing the I urtfrf available for each,
DANGER SIGNAL
If the fire bell should ring would you
run and stop it, or go and help pat out
tho fire? It is much the same way with
a cough. A ;ough is a danger slgna
as much as a lire bell. You should no
more try to suppress it than to stop a
lire bell when it Is ringing, but should
euro tho disease that causes theoough
ing. This Can nearly always be done
by taking Chnin,berJaln's Cough Rem
edy. Many have used ic with the most
benefllclal results. It Is especially val
uable for the persistent 'cough that so
often follows a bad cold or an attack
of the grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching
Andrews, Ind., writes: Ddring the win
ter my husband takes cold easily and
coughs anil coughs. Chamberlain's
Cough Kv.rn.edy is the best medicine
for breaking up these attacks and you
cannot get him to take any other. For
