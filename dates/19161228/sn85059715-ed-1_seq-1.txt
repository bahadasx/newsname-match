Any Plan to Have Adamson

CONFERENCE IS ON AGAIN
Trainmen Will Receive No Benefit

(BY ASSOC! AT CO PNCI8)
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.?Creation
of a federal commission to decide
disputes between railroads and their
employes, regardless of whether the
United States supreme court may
hold the Adamson act constitutional,
was the suggestion which the chiefs
of the four railway brotherhoods indicated
Thursday they might place
before the conference committee of
railroad managers. Representatives
of the two sides went into conference
here to discuss the Adamson law and
its effects.
W. G. Lee, president of the Brotherhood/br
Railway Trainmen, discussing
the idea, said:
"I believe, and a number of the
railroad managers agree, that the creation
of a federal commission of eight
members, four representing the roads
and four the brotherhoods sitting as
a court of official adjudication could
satisfactorily dispose of whatever
ftnc?ftuuca in 1511 l. ucvciup ueiwccu
the roads and their employes.
"The members of such a commission
must be men who understand
their business, but before becoming
members they would be compelled to
sever all connections they previously
had with either side. Such a commission
should have plenary powers,
would hold hearings and after deliberations
would announce its decision."
(BY ABIOCIATIO PRCSS1
NEW YORK, Dec. 2 8?The national
conference committee of railroad
managers and representatives of
the four brotherhoods resumed here
Thursday their conference relative to
the application of the Adamson law
in the event that it is held to be
constitutional by the United States
supreme court. Through an agreement
between Attorney General
Gregory and the railway attorneys
the effectiveness of the Adamson law
has been suspended pending the out
come 01 xne xest suix. xnereiore on
January 1 the employes will continue
their work without any immediate
benefits from the law which was to
have gone into operation on that day.
The railroads, it is understood, will
not withdraw the suit nor permit
anything to halt the decision of the
court. It was said also that the railroad
managers would decline to enter
into an alliance with the unions
in return for their support in the efforts
to defeat President Wilson's
proposed compulsory investigation of
labor disputes. The railroads will
also decline, it was said, to co-operate
in any plan to have the Adamson
law repealed.
BIG DEAL
In oal Lands May Be Swung
by the Consolidation
Coal Company.
CONNELLSVILLE. Pa.. Dec. 28.?
Rumors of another great coal deal
place the Consolidation Coal Company
in the role-of probable purchasers
of the entire West "Virginia
holdings of Josiah V. Thompson, of
Uniontown, amounting to about 84,000
acres. Basing the value on the
average for West Virginia coal, $150
an acre, the Consolidation deal -would
amount to $12,000,000 and would be
the largest in the history of the coal
Industry.

NANTUCKET. Mass., Dec. 28.?
The steamship Maryland was regarded

I coast guard cutters Acushnet and
Gresham, which was begun after the
Maryland's wireless calls of distress
were suddenly silenced Christmas

they -were picked up by a passing
steamer.

And This Time the Dopester
Has the "Purchase" Price
Partly Paid.
CHARLESTON. Dec. 2S?Another
: trunk line railway is to enter Char|
leston. Negotiations for the sale of
' the Coal and Coke railway to the Baltimore
and Ohio road are, reported to
' have been completed and the report
I Is current in railroad circles that part
j i payment has been made for the propi
erty.
For several months negotiations
! for the purchase of the property have
; i been pending and various interests
are known to have sought to buy the
' Coal and Coke road, but it was only
| a few days ago that the Baltimore
I and Ohio system took over the prop- c
! erty and it has not yet been officially
j announced. n
The Coal and Coke railway, run- ?
ning between Charleston and Elkins, ^
Is more than one hundred miles in ?
length, traverses through a rather J
sparsely settled section of the state **
which Is also one of the wealthiest in e
undeveloped natural resources.
It was constructed by three of the
foremost of West Virginia builders,
the late Henry Gassaway Davis, who ^
was president of the road until his
death a few months ago: the late v
Senator Stephen B. Elkins and the a
late Richard C. Kerens, of Missouri, a
former ambassador to Vienna and an
intimate friend of Davis and Elkins. s
It has been suggested for many e
months that with the purchase of the
Coal and Coke railway by the great c
t Baltimore and Ohio system that ex- t<
tensions would be made from Elkins li
the northern terminus, which would
! connect the lateral road with the w
| main line of the Baltimore and Ohio
i giving that line a direct route to Is
; Charleston from New York wlf/h a h
much lesser distance than now prevails.
y.
With the Coal and Coke road in- it
gress to Charleston, the capital city
! of West Virgilna, acquires another ii
j trunk line, one of the greatest In the a
I world, and materially enhances the
prospects for the future of the city ^
from a shipping, as well as other 11
standpoints. e
The Coal and Coke railway is the h
most valuable of all West Virginia
lateral roads. At Charleston it connected
with the Kanawha and MIchi- a
gan line and with the Richwood- n
Clarksburg branch of the Baltimore
! and Ohio at Orlando, and finally with
| the Western Maryland road at the "
other end of the line.
That the Baltimore and Ohio sys- ^
tern, of which Daniel Willard Is
president, will make many repairs to
the new property. Is generally antic- ?
ipated. From Gassaway to Elkins J
the Coal and Coke is said by railroad men
to be in excellent condition, but
heavier rails and improvements to c
the road bed are said to be needed
between Gassaway and Charleston. rr
With the connection of the Coal
and Coke with the main line of the ^
Baltimore and Ohio the immediate ^
development of the large deposits of ^
coal and valuable tracts of virgin 0
timber in the territory traversed by s.
the road constructed by the Davis
and Elkins interests would naturally ^
follow. E
While development has already
started on the line of the Coal and -n
V->UtVC dull 111 <1 Llj IU1UCS uavc UCKU
opened, facilities for the removal of e
coal to the markets have been such
as to almost preclude Investment and t<
development in that section of the h
state. h
With the sale of the road these conditions
will be changed and there will a
be an influx of new capital into the A
territory effected by the transfer of h
the road to the Baltimore and Ohio
system. v

DAVID GOL
TO LEC1
Noted Boston Lecturer and
Author Will Speak Here
Sunday, January 7.
Ponce and War la the subject to
bo discussed under the auspices or
Clarksburg: Council of Knights or Columbus
at the Robinson Grand theater
on Sunday. January 7. by the
well known orator, debater and author.
David Golstein. of Boston. The
supreme officers oC the (Knights of
Columbus, who are conducting a nation-wide
lecture movement in defense
of Christian principles against
the insidious propagandas of the enemies
of God and country, have assigned
Mr. Goldstein for a lecture in
this city.
Great enthusiasm Is manifesting
itself among the local Knights at the
coming or their brother knight, who
is making his third annual tour for
the order.
In reporting his Chautauqua work
of last summer the Pontlac, 111., Daily
Leader says: "The address of David
Gllsteln, of Boston, secretary of the
Boston School of Political Economy,
attracted wide attention at the ffrst
Sunday meeting of the Chautauqua
yesterday.
"Mr. Goldstein is an interesting
speaker, gifted with a keen, penetrating
intellect, a marvelous flow
of language, and a trenchant, almost
cold-blooded way of driving fact after
fact right homo to his hearers. He
doos not mince words, and every sentence
he utters is given In a way that
almost forces assent."
Mr. Goldstein was formerly a foremost
leader in the Social movement,
having been the first candidate of
tho Socialist party for mayor of his |
home city,. Boston. He Is said to
have resigned from the Socialist
movement twelve years ago after n
futile attempt to get the organization
to repudiate Immoral teachings. Ills
reasons are outlined in a hook called
"Socialism, the Natloil of Fatherless
Children." which has a circulation of
over 40.000 copies. It Is highly recommended
by Cardinal O'Connoll.
Col. Roosevelt, Samuel Gompers. and
othor distinguished opponents of Socialism
the country over.
The committee of Clarksburg
Council of the Knights of Columbus
announces that Mr. Goldstein will
gladly answer all questions related to
his subject?"Peace and War"?at
the conclusion of his address. This
feature of the speaker's work adds
zest to the occasion, for Mr. Goldstein
is said to be a post master in
meeting friend and foe face to face
with a courteous but decisive defense
of his convictions. The Providence
Journal says: "The readiness with
which Mr. Goldstein handled the
queries which were hurled at: him,
sometimes two and three at a time,
indicated his thorough knowledge of
his subject, and his ability to discuss
it at all angles."
Speaking of Mr. Goldstein's work
in San Francisco, the Monitor says:
"There were 5.000 people in
Dreamland pavilion last night. That
immense auditorium and Its spacious
galleries was packed to the doors.
Hundreds were obliged to stand;
many were turned away. The sea of
humanity that greeted the speaker
when he stopped forth must have
been an inspiring sight to him. To a
less courageous man the knowledge
that hundreds of his sworn enemies;
the 'Reds,' were also gathered there, 1
come to defy him and cry him down,
might have been disconcerting, to say
the least. But to Goldstein, 'the more
the merrier.' There never was a
crowd of Socialists big enough yet to
do anything but sharpen his wit the
keener and reinforce his daring all
the more.
"Goldstein's lecture was more than
a lecture. It was a spectacle and a
debate?one man against hundreds.
The air was surcharged with the
electricity of the conflict. The dramatic
suspense was- keener than In
the most breathless play. To see that
little Napoleon of the "platform
marshaling his forces?'facts, facts,
facts'?against the guerrilla warfare
of his enemies, and mercilessly mowing
them down till they were flattened
like a wheatfleld after a cyclone,
was an intellectual treat and a sportsman's
joy."
The meeting will be held at the
Robinson Grand theater at 2:30
o'clock sharp. Admission' will bo
free.
