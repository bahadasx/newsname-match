DECISION AGAINST CATHOLIC ,
MUTUAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATION
Supreme Court of New . York State
Disapproves Reorganization Plan.
Buffalo. N. Y.," Dec. 27. Justice
Dudley in supreme fcourt here today
decided against the plan for the re
organization of the Catholic Mutual
Benefit Association under which the
reserve fund of the organization was
to have been divided into two parts.
It was proposed that the organization
be divided into two classes, one com
posed of men who had joined prior to
ltfu4, the others or those who had
joined after that date. Division of
the reserve fund proportionate to the
number of men in the two classes
was proposed after actuaries had re
ported that the organization was not
on a sustaining basis. It was plan
ned that the rates in the second class
should be revised on a scientific
basis. The old members would pay
the same rates as long as the reserve
fund proved adequate to meet the
claims. If it failed, extra assessments
might be imposed. The old men ob
jected to this plan and secured a tem
porary injunction which was today
continued.
Justice Dudley did not discuss the
right of the organization to form two
classes of membership, but held that
the reserve fund must not be divided.
The case, which affects members of
the organization all over the country,
will be appealed, attorneys for the C.
M. B. A., announced. The re-classification
was to have gone into effect
on January 1.

SERVICE IN CANADA
In an Endeavor to Make Conscription
Unnecessary.
Ottawa, Ont.,' Dec. 27. In a letter
sent today to organized labor. Premier
Borden said that "the proposal for
national service Is not connected with
conscription, but rather the idea was
to make an appeal for voluntary na
tional service which would render un
necessary any resort to conscription."
He declined to give assurance that
under ' no circumstances would con
scription be carried out in Canada, as
serting: "If conscription should prove the
only effective method to preserve the
existence of the state, I should con
sider it necessary and should not hesi
tate to act accordingly."

sents a market of 6,000,000 consumers
ha- itself, -as well as being . the chief
distributing, center ..for Europe, has
interested the producing men of the
country -in this plan purely as a good
business proposition, the commission
er said. "It is is. no attempt to put
the middleman out of business by leg

SPECIAL MESSENGER IS BEARING
COMMUNICATION
ON PRESENT PROTOCOL
Luis Cabrera, i Mexican Delegate, is
Accompanying Messenger to Wash
ington to Personally Explain Gen
eral Carranza's Position Delay May
be Overlooked.
'
Washington, Dec. 27. Carranza's
attitude toward the Atlantic City pro
tocol, which will determine whether
negotiations between the United
States and the Mexican de facto gov
ernment are to be continued by the
existing joint commission will be out
lined to Secretary Lane tomorrow by
Luis Cabrera, one of the Mexican
commissioners. No definite informa
tion to indicate what that attitude is
had reached officials tonight.
Special Messenger Bears Message.
Secretary Lane, who is chairman of
the commission, was notified early to
night that a special messenger bear
ing a communication from the Mexl
can commissioners, presumably Gen
eral Carranza's reply to the American
demand that he approve or reject the
protocol, had left New York lor Wash
ington. " When the secretary retired:
for the night, however, the messeng
er had not arrived and word had come
meantime that Mr. Cabrera himself
would reach the capital tomorrow
morning to explain personally General
Carranza s position.
Delay May be Overlooked.
Although the United States had set
last midnight as the time by which a
reply from General Carrana woulzd be
expected, it was indicated tonight that
if the protocol is approved the delay
may be overlooked, since the chief
purpose here has bee nto secure a sat
isfactory adjustment.
If the protocol is rejected Secretary
Lane will proceed with plans already
under way to wind up the commiss
affairs and adjourn sine die.
Just what the next step would be
officials would not discuss. A rejec
tion of the protocol, which provides
for conditional withdrawal of Gen
Pershings expedition would be interp
reted here as a reinforcement of Gen
Carranza s demand of last summer
that the American troops be with
drawn unconditionally.
. No Change in Policy.. .
! It is reiterated' that there has been
no chane-e. tfi the adrainlstratl'&'s ool-
Icy, which contemplates maintenance
of an efficient force at the border and
does not purpose withdrawal of the
Pershing expedition until it is appar
ent that the step will not endanger
American territory.
NANTUCKET FISHERMAN
GET. ABANDONED SCHOONER
Brought Ship Into Port in an A p part

Nantucket, Mass., Dec. 27. The
fisher folk at Great Point gained
rich prize today when they brought
into port here, apparently seaworthy,
the tree-masted schooner Roger Bru
ry, which was abandoned yesterday
by her crew." The men of the Drury
had reported that their vessel was in a
sinking .condition. Te fishedmen who
went out to her in the small steamer
Petrel, however, found her riding the
seas easily. With the price of tonnage
unusually high, their salvage reward
is expected to prove large. The Rog
er Drury was bound from New York
for St. John, N. B. !
The schooners Daniel McLoud and
Ravola, the latter of British registry,
which were thrown on te rip at Great
Point, in yesterday's gale, probably

CENTRAL POWERS' REPLY
IS SAID TO BE EVASIVE
By the Editorial Writers in Rome
May Lead to Some Negotiations.
Rome, via Paris. Dec. 27. 10.20 p. m,
-The answer of the central powers to
President Wilson's peace proposal is
declared by the editorial writers to
be evasive, and especially as regards
the president s chief request that the
belligerents state their terms of peace-
Some of the newspapers express the
opinion that the present opportunity
should not be allowed to pass, as it
may lead to some satisfactory form of
negotiations. All of them, however.
are agreed that the entente allies' can
only conclude peace on terms which
will preclude the possibility of future
wars.

THE HOPE EXPRESSED
PRESIDENT WILSON
BY
BUT GULF IS WIDE
Germany is Ready to Make Known
Her Terms on First Day of Con
ference,' Should One Materialize
Rumors Persist That Some Confi
dential Word Will Follow Note.
Washington, Dec. 27. In spite of the
wide gulf between the insistence of
the central powers for an immediate
peace conference and the forecast of
unanimous refusal by the entente
allies to enter such a conference with
out knowing Germany's terms in ad
vance, the American government be
lieves that the negotiations in progress
are resulting in good. It was said
with authority tonight that until the
door to peace actually is closed by one
side or the other, President Wilson
will continue to hope that any discus
sion of the subject will tend to hasten
the end of the war.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, returning unexpectedly
tonight from New York, authorized
The Associated Press. to make the fol
lowing statement:
Statement by Von Bernstorff.
"I regard the note of my government
as constituting an acceptance of ev
erything suggested by President Wil
son in his note to the belligerent na
tions of Europe."
It was made clear at the embassy
that Germany stands ready to make
known her terms on the first day of
any conference that may be held, and
officials expressed themselves as being
greatly surprised at the view prevail
ing in some quarters here that the
Berlin government had failed to meet
the president's suggestions by not set
ting down in the reply the terms upon
which it is willing to make peace. The
German diplomats say President Wil
son had no intention of drawing a
public declaration concerning terms
from the central powers. On the con
trary, they think the president s sug
gestion "that an early occasion be
sought to call out from all the nations
now at war such an avowal of their
respective views as to the terms upon
which th ewar might be concluded"
has been fully met by Germany in
Becking an immediate conference with
her enemies. .
German Policy Outlined.
The German policy, upon which the
reply to President Wilson's communi
cation is based, was outlined as fol
lows: .
"Germany feels that the conference
suggested by it first should be com
posed of delegates from the belligerent
countries whose duty it, would be to
settle territorial terms. Once these
terms are agreed upon, representatives
of the neutrals should be called in to
participate in consideration of the
questions of guarantees for the future,
in which neutrals are as vitally con
cerned as belligerents. These guaran
tees in the German view necessarily
would have to do with the freedom of
the seas, limited disarmment, forma
tion of a world league of nations to
enforce peace and the establishment
of an international court of arbitra
tion.
Germany is said to consider that
neutral nations can have no interest
of their own in terms such as those
relating to territory.
Something Confidential Coming
While there were no official advices
upon the subject, the view still per
sisted in German quarters tonight that
the note of the central powers might
be followed by some highly confiden
tial oral or written communication to
President Wilson, in which at least
broad tentative terms might be stated.
In -this connection officials noted with
interest Berlin press despatches saying
that Ambassador Gerard, who as a
result of his recent visit to the United
States is thoroughly familiar with the
views of President Wilson, had taken
lunch with Alfred Zimmerman, the
German foreign minister, and probably
discussed the peace situation with
him.
