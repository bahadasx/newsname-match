ROAD TO PEACE
Willing to Permit Confidential
Exchange of Broad Tenta
tive Terms Through Wilson
if Necessary
WOULD GIVE TERMS
ENTENTE DEMANDS
Intimated Statement of Teu
ton Positions Either Had
Been Communicated to U.
S. or Soon Would Be
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28.—Ger
many, it was made known here to-day,
will not permit the road to peace ne
gotiations to be blocked by a refusal
of the entente belliKerents to enter a
conference without prior knowledge of
her terms. It has been forecast that
the entente powers would base a re
fusal on such a condition.
The central powers are represented
as willing to permit a confidential ex
change of broad tentative terms
through President Wilson should it
become necessary to do so to bridge
the gap which threatens to prevent a
gathering of peace delegates. There
were broad intimations to-day that a
statement of this position by Germany
cither had been communicated to the
United States Government or soon
would be.
The official text of Germany's reply
to President Wilson's note arrived to
day and it was declared that no con
fidential communication from Ambas
sador Gerard accompanied it. It has
been announced in advance that it
would not be made public and it is
likely that the receipt would not even
be admitted.
Germany, it was said to-day. Is
looking to the United States to make
every effort to bring about a peace
conference and to that end is ready to
consider any suggestions from the
President. As the case stands now,
the German Government considers it
has met all the suggestions in the
President's note and a statement to
that effect has been made by Count

safety department to make arrests for
automobile law •iolations and for the
larceny or attempted lareenv of auto
mobiles. Names of the auxiliary po

planned to increase their number to
three hundred in a short time.

MAKE DEALER
WEIGH YOUR
BREAD-REEL
"Then Buy the Heaviest Loaf,"
Advice of City Sealer of
Weights
TESTS SHOW VARIANCE
Announces Results of Investi
gation of Various Makes in
This City
Bread Price Increase
Is Not Yet Decided
What the new year will bring in
bread prices is still an undecided
question. Grocerymen and dealers
who buy bread from the larger ba
keries anticipate a smaller loaf but
no change in price. Inquiries at
the Schmidt and West Shore plants
failed to bring any information as
what would be the final outcome.
Bernard Schmidt said there was
nothing to announce, and he could
not say when there would be a
statement. L. M. Bricker, of the
West Shore Bakery, was also silent
on the question of increase in price
or a decrease in size of a loaf. He
would not say what the new year
would bring.
*■
"Make your dealer weigh your
bread, Mr. and Mrs. Public—and then
buy the heaviest loaf!"
That is the advice City Sealer Harry
D. Keel offered through the Tele
graph to the people of the city, in
view of the talked-of increase in price
or decrease in size per loaf of the
staff of life.
Only a few weeks ago big baking
concerns declared that the increasing
cost of materials and operation un
questionably pointed to an advance
of from five cents to six cents in the
cost at the present weight per loaf.
"To Gouge tlio Public"
City Sealer Keel to-day reiterated
his statement of several weeks ago
that the contemplated move was
I merely "an attempt to gouge the pub-
I lie."
Investigations which have been con
ducted during the last few weeks re
| vealed the fact that the smaller ba
kers could bake bread weighing thir
teen ounces to the loaf, sell the com
modity at live cents a loaf—and still
make a fair profit.
Furthermore the Sealer submitted
figures showing the variations in
weights of the loaves of various kinds
as baked by the larger establish
ments.
Advice to Consumers
In answer to a question as to the
bread situation and the possible de
velopments incident to the approach
ing new year, City Sealer Keel went
into considerable detail in a brief in
terview.
"My advice to the consumer," said

Safer to Be Fireman Than
Policeman and Either Is
Safer Than Plain Citizen
New York, Dec. 28.—Statistics pre
pared by medical officers of the New
York police and fire departments and
submitted to Mayor Mitehel by Fire
Commisisoner Adamson indicate that
despite the risks of their service it is
safer to be a fireman than a policeman
and safer to be either than a plain
citizen. Percentages of death and ill
ness are lower in both services than ir
} the general average of the public.
Avalanches and Landslides
Threaten Swiss Villages
Berne, Dec. 27, via Paris, Dec. 28.
I The destruction of the village of
I Champery, a tourist resort in the Can
i ton of Valis, is threatened by the sud-
I den onset of a number of avalanches
coupled with a landslide. Several
houses have been crushed and the
whole population has evacuated the
village. Swiss troops and 200 interned
French prisoners of war are working
day and night to preserve the rest of
the village.
An enormous avalanche has swept
away many Alpine huts near Simplon
Pass, killing two men and many cattle.
OL1) STUMP TREASURE VAULT
Farmer Finds Jar of Gold and Notes
in Removing It at Last
Sellnsgrove, Pa„ Dec. 28. After
having postponed from time to time
the destruction of a stump near his
barn, ever since he bought the farm
three years ago, S. H. Kline, residing
three miles west of McClure, Synder
county, decided just for a little exer
cise to remove it.
He had worked but a little while
when his pick struck an earthen jar,
and gold and silver coins rolled out
on the snow. Kline labored with fev
erish anxiety unti lhe had extracted
the jar, then lie gathered up the spill
ed coins, and, clutching the jar in his
arm, galloped his horse to the bank.
When Cashier Eenfer told him his
find was $1,343, the excited old man
fainted. Half of it was in paper
money of 30 years ago, issued by the
Mifflin National Bank, of Lewistown,
and First National Bank of Selins
grove, and in good preservation.
Kline paid $1,400 for the farm.
People of the community are at a loss
to explain who secreted the money.
WOMEN* WANT TROOPS HOME
Cleveland, Ohio. Dec. 28.—Secretary
of War Baker last night was/oesieged
by a committee of Cleveland women
which demanded that he bring the
Ohio national guardsmen home from
the Texas border. Baker was on his
way to the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity's annual banquet when they
cornered him in the hotel lobby. He
said it was not his fault that the
guardsmen were not home and that he
couldn't promise when they would be
released.

PRESIDENT 00 YEARS OLD

WAR IN EUROPE RESPONSIBLE
FOR BIG INCREASE OF CRIME
HERE DECLARES WINDSOR
"The astonishing increase of crime
Is doubtless due to the European war"
was the declaration of Superintendent
of Detectives W. L. Windsor this
morning.
"An exhaustive research in the po
lice records of thla and other cities
shows that crime of every kind has
increased, in some cases GO per cent.,
during the year now closing, and this
must surely have some deep under
lying cause.
"That crime among the educated
class decreases yearly points to the
fact that men and women of weak
wills and mentality are more easily
affected by outside psychological in
fluences is the way 1 size up the sit
CARRANZA STANDS
FOR WITHDRAWAL
Reply Believed to Insist of
Troops Leaving and Sug
gests Modifications
Washington, D. C., Dec. 28.—Luis
Cabrera, chairman of the Mexican
commission, arrived here from New
York "tMs morning bearing the answer
of Carranza to the demand o£ the
American representatives that he
ratify or repudiate the protocol signed
at Atlantic City. He made telegraphic
arrangements last night with Secre
tary Lane to submit the answer to
day. The character of Carranza's reply
has not been revealed, but it was
generally believed it was another sug
gestion for modifications and con
tained the insistence that the Ameri
can troops in Mexico be withdrawn
unconditionally.
It has been understood here for sev
eral days that if General Carranza did
not return such an answer as would
warrant a reassembling of the joint
commission, the negotiations would be
declared ended nnd that General Car
ranza's ambassador. Eliseo Arredondo.
would return to Mexico, leaving the
embassy here in charge of a confiden
tial agent. This would not amount to
a severance of diplomatic relations,
but in a strict sense there npver have
been any. Such a turn, of course,
would prevent sending Henry P.
Fletcher. American ambassador-desig
nate, to Mexico City. In short, the
situation would return to the point
it occupied before the commission ne
gotiations began.
Mr. Arredondo to-day unqualifiedly
denied published reports that he had
been recalled.
"It is absolutely untrue that I have
been recalled by my government," said
he, "nor do I know if the government
is contemplating summoning me. If
it should occur as it did a few weeks
ago, it would not be in the nature of
my withdrawal from my post."
HONEST EGGS' INK AWFUL
Might Get into Coffee nnd Give It
Literary Flavor
New York, Dec. 28. Danger of an
ink flavor in coffee settled by eggshells
was advanced as one reason against
stamping "sold storage" on eggs in ar
gument here yesterday before the Su
preme Court on the application of
John J. Dillon, State Commissioner of
Foods and Markets, for an injunction
against selling eggs not so marked.
Another argument was that the indi
viduality of eggs as to shape made the
labeling of each one impracticable.
The arguments were presented by
grocerymen's counsel.

"We all know," he said, "that the
old saying, 'Violence breeds violence,'
is very true. Just so, the thought of
violence breeds violence. The dally
papers are filled with gruesome tales
of wholesale slaughter, violence and
confusion across the water. This all

mind of weaklings that In turn
prompts them to violence of every
sort.
"Neither do I see any Immediate
