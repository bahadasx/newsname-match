COUNTY OFFICIALS TO GET -lit

LAW IS EFFECTIVE.

News of North Dakota Officials an«
and Institutions Arranged in Com

Readers of This Paper.
Bismarck
County officers' salaries, beginning
January l, will be based on population
instead of assessed valuation, as here
tofore. The law to this effect wat
enacted by the last legislature. At
the same time the legislature adopted
an act providing that there shoulq be
no increases in salaries over tfjose paid
on the 1914 assessed value prior to
July l, 1917. The two conflicting
statutes left many county officera in
doubt and Attorney General Linde
was called upon for opinion. He has
advised that there is no question in
his mind that the salaries after Janu
ary 1 will be paid on a population ba
Bis, which will mean an increase ip a
majority of the counties.
Hanna To Live In Fargo,
Governor Hanna'a family has lefl
for Fargo to resume residence in thai
city. The Hanna family spent ChrlBt
mas in Fargo, but the governor return
ed to Bismarck the following dqy tc
wind up his administration and pre
pare for the inaugural of Governor
eleot Lynn Frazier, of Hoople,
Under the constitution the new gov
ernor can take his oath of office th«
first Monday in January, which this
year is New Years day.
Four years ago Governor Hanna
took the oath of office January 8 and
wo years ago he succeeded himseii
formally, Jan. 6.
When Governor-elect Frazier in
Bismarck recently, Governor Hwutq
met him and offered every ^gsiatanc^
to aid Mr. Fraizier in assuming the
governorship.
Governor Hanna has prepared his
.farewell messase which was tc b.,
livered previous to the message of Mr.
Frazier on Wednesday, J&n. a, when it
was expected all oaths of office would
be administered.
•k
Court Dispute Unsettled,
Justice-elect James E. Robinson
hats ji'.9t served notice on State Audi
tor Jorgenson that ha would be held
personally responsible for any war
rants issued to retiring members ol
the supreme bench. Robinson filed
with Jorgenson his certificate of elec
tion, dating from the first Monday in
December and advised the auditor that
hta term of office began December 4
and that he will olaim salary from that
date,
"Your are cautioned," read Jorgen
son's letter, "against paying the re
tiring justices any salary or giving
them a warrant for any salary for the
month of December, 1916. If you
should give them a warrant for De
cember salary it will put the state to
trouble, and the expense of bringing
suit against you and against the retir
ing justices to recover the same."
To Limit Game Bags in Dakota.
A game bag limit of five will be ree
commended to the state legislature this
Winter by the North Dakota game
boar(J of control, as a measure of pro
tection to the prairie chickens of
North Dakota.
The rapid disappearance of the bird,
which have brought to North Dakota
year softer year hordes of sportsmen
from over the entire nation, has
brought about such an acute condition
that North Dakota sportsmen are
practically a unit in favor of the re
duction of the bag limit, and they also
generally approve of the game board's
recommendation for a delayed
ing of the season.
More Home-Owners In N. D,
Rpte expert Little of the railroad
wommission in a recent delve into cen
sus statistics discovered the fact that
North Dakota leads all other states in
the union in the proportion of home
owners^ per capita, which is 80 per
?#nt. In other words, only one fam
ily out of twenty lives in rented prop
erty. In Minnesota the percentage of
home-owners is 63.5 in Montana 56.6
?er cent of the people own Oieir homes,
in South Dakota the proportion is 71.2.
Denies Discussing Case.
Governor Hanna emphatically den
ies allegations made by the county
commissioners of Hettinger in their
appearance from his ouster decision
tq the effect that he discussed the case
with parties not concerned as princi
pals or witnesses and that undue pres
sure was brought to bear to induce
him to change a decision originally
arrived at in favor of the commission
ers.

ANNOUNCEMENT
We beg to annouuc^ tb« closing of our Local Office at Hope until March first next'
when, at that time, we will open up with a stronger force and a greater determination
than ever to sell lands tributary to Hope. We have had a splendid business, particular
ly so, considering the unfavorable year for selling land. We attribute a great deal of
our success to the loyal manner in which the people of the town and the farmers in
general, stuck by and boosted the town, the country and this Company. We appreciate
these things as it helps more than hundreds of dollars worth of advertising, not only to
us but to your own community as well. We found no knocking in Hope among the farm
ers or business men, or any one else. This means something". It means better busi
ness, more business, more activity, in all lines and a pleasanter place to live.
You will have a number of good substantial farmers from other states move into
your community in the spring, through the efforts of this Company, and we hope you
will receive them, which we know you will, with a glad hand and encouraging words,
which means much to the new-comer. If he feels the hand of encouragement he will
not get homesick after the first year but will send the word back home and scores of
others will follow him. The way to build up a country is to get good people and good
settlers into it.
Again thanking you for your loyal support and hoping next year will be the best
and grandest of all, and wishing you a Merry Christmas, we are,
Sincerely,
P. S. Immediately after January first, we will begin soliciting listings and pre
paring our field books for 1917 business. If you have land you desire to sell, we strong
ly urge listing early as the sooner we complete our lists, the sooner we can get them to
our agents, and your farm may be the one to attract their oustomer. Remember th«
address and write us early.

voice: 'Any mail for Mike Howe?"
"Xo!" thundered the postmaster, with
out casting an eye toward the box
marked H. 'Not for your cow nor any
one else's cow. Move on." And he
moved. What's in a name? A good
deal some times.
We Can Do Bigger Things.
A Lyceum entertainment course has
been contracted for our young people
this winter. Financial responsibility
has been assumed by a few that our
community might enjoy this seriea
of entertainments. Now, a few can
not do very much in bringing big
things to our town, but five hundred
working together can bring to tftir
doors the very best the larger cities
can afford. Five hundred people giv
ing one dollar each can do more than
five people giving one hundred dol
lars each. It is the individual inter
est and enthusiasm in the success of
an institution that wins.
After all ia Mid and done, how

much does It cost us to furnish clean,
high class, instructive, entertaining
amusement for the entire community?
When you and I do our part, just a
dollar or two for a season ticket. Are
you not public spirited enough to cOtb
tribute, this small amount to the so
cial enbetterment of our community?
Be a booster and be among the first
to secure your season tickets.
Rabies.
A case of rabies reported In En*
land last spring was the first in that
country since 1902, and occurred in a
dog that was being held in the six
months' quarantine which the English
law imposes on all dogs brought into
the country to prevent the introduo
tion of this disease. Rabies was ban
ished from England by muzzling. Aus
tralia and New Zealand have never
bad any cases of rabies, and a system
of quarantine and inspection prevents
Its introduction. Sweden, Norway and
Denmark are practically free from It
