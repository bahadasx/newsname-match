Failure to find any trace of John

The dog last week did some watch
ful waiting and the animal's pati
ence resulted in Freddie Kraemer,
aged 8. of 344 Pacific avenue. being
bitten in the left wrist.
Young Kraemer and Robert Ser
pas. a boy of his own age, were sky
larking in front of Mrs. Murran's
residence, where there is a picket
fence. While the boys skylarked.
Mrs. Murran's dog followed their
movements by running from one end
of the fence to the other as the boys
wrestled back and forth on the side
walk. Soddenly Serpas pushed the
Kraemer boy, who fell against the
fence. his left arm going through
•ne of the openings.
Quick as a flash the 0og sank his
teeeth into the boy's wrlist and tore
a piece out of his coat. Young Krae
-mer was taken to the Charity Hos
pital, where he will undergo the
Pasteur treatment. His injury is
not regarded as serious.

LEVEE BOARDO OTES
Colonel Townsend, head of the
Mississippi River Commission, said
in a letter read at a meeting of the
Orleans Levee Board Wednesday
night, that the board is author'zed
to go ahead with protection of the
caving bank of the river at the ('a
nal street ferry landing in Algiers,
the work to be done without the
supervision of the federal govern
ment. Some time ago the Levee
Board asked the federal government
to do this work. and was informed
the government had neither the ma
terial nor the funds for the work. It
was proposed, instead the Levee
Board move the levee line back 150
feet, which meant the abandonment
of three or four million dollars of
property. The board, as a counter
proposition, offered to furnish the
federal government the material and
the funds to do the work. Now it
is given permission to do the work
itself.
tlorace Williams, of I)oullut and
Williams. brought up the matter of
the ship dock his firm proposed to
build on the Algiers side of the riv
er. Mr. Fiayssoux said the serious
matter that presented itse:f to tihe
committee that considered the pro
ject was whether the location 001ould
interfere with the Belt road, the
Grand Isle road. and the shipping
of the port, and the cotmmittee had
decided on further investigation.
Mr. Williams told the committee he
was prepared to pay $25 a month
rent and was told if this was his
figure there was nothing more to be
said. The matter was referred to
the executive committee. to report
back to the next meeting.
1()1'S HAVE (;4N)I) TIME.
The Sixth Precinct had a grand
rally and Christmas at Belleville So
cial and Political Club's headquar
ters. 615 Opelousas avenue, on Sat
urday. It was a most enjoyable af
fair and spirit of good will and
friendship prevailed. Sixty-five menim
bers were present from the 6th Pre
cinct. The hall was decorated for
the occasion and the Christmas Tree
was filled with presents for each
member and as their numbers were
called out the presentation of toys
were made which created much
laughter and brought back many
gray heads and bald ones as well to
memories of their childhood days.
Tim Allingham was tendered a vote
of thanks for having staged this lit
tle surprise on the boys. Refresh
ments were served and games were
enjoyed until midnight. Wm. Daul

TO BUiLD( GOOD ROADS.
On Saturday afternoon, a delega
tion of interested land owners, a
representative of the good roads
commission and representatives of
the New Orleans and Lower Coast
Railroad made a special trip along
the right bank of the Outfall Drain
age Canal where already some eight
hundred dollars has been extended
in grading this levee bank to make
a good road to connect the Belle
chase road with Algiers. The trip
was made by automobile from the
pumping station to the point where
the Lower Coast Railroad crosses
this canal, a distance of about four
and one-half miles. While the road
was very rough, it was very conclu
sive that a good foundation for a
good road is there and will require
a very little additional money to put
It in good shape. Those in the party
were Mr. Geo. Hero, Mr. Barksdale,
the new owner of the Belle Chase
plantation. Mr. McLean, of the Al
giers Railway and Lighting Co., and
Mr. E. W. Burgis, superintendent.
President H. D. Emerson of the N.
O. and Lower Coast Railroad and
Mr. Kerr of the Good Roads Com
mission. The object of the trip was
to interest the city officials and also
the good roads commission in the
opportunities afforded by construct
ing this road. It is understood also
that many private interests will be
glad to subscribe funds to help along
the construction of this new road
way, namely J. J. Manson, Eugene
Dyer and Meyer Eiseman, George
Hero, Mr. Barksdale and others. Ap
plication has already been made to
the city for help in the further im
provement of the road.
JUNIOR CIRCLE DOES MERITOR.
IOU8 WORK.
The "Junior Circle" of the King's
Daughters who are in charge of Mrs.
Jas. L. Higgins, made this a real
Xmas for thirteen little hearts who
were in unfortunate circumstances
and who had little or nothing to look
forward to in the way of the holiday
pleasures and Joyful times or Santy
gifts of their more fortunate friends.
Mrs. Higgins, who presides as leader
and the members of this noble and
charitable society, made a success not
only in bringing happiness and cheer
to the hearts of these little ones, but
In giving them good substantial shoes
and hose and the proper kind of un
ierclothlng, also brought comfort to
the little bodies who were so poorly
clad.
The Junior Circle is enjoying a hap
py Christmas in the happy thought
of knowing that they have brought
happiness to others.
