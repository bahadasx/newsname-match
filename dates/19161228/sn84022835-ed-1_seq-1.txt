Home Talent Musicale Pleases
Those who ventured out 'the' cold
wintry blasts in order to witness the
production of "Tho Rose Maiden", A
home talent musicale given at the Or
pheum on Thursday of last week
were well rewarded for their sacrifice
as this entertainment was one of tho
beatlf hot the best, ever given in our
cityjiMuch credit is due those taking
part in this musicale, as they exhibited
their musical talent to a marked de
gree on this occasion.
Owing to the severe winter weather,
the audience was not as large as such
a fine production warrants, neverthe
less, the smallnesa of the audience
did not in any way discourage the
players and the entire program was
carried out with as much vim and zest
as though they were playing to a pack
ed house.
Rod Cloud should be, and Is, proud
of the fact that she possesses such
talented musical artists and it is to
be hoped that when weather condi
tions are favorablo enough to insure a
much larger audiouce that "The Roso
Maldoii",tnay make another appearance
in our city."
