DEATH OF A PIONEER
CITIZEN
. Dr. J. Everingham Dies at His
Home in This City After a
-Long Illness.
Doctor J. Everingham, one of
Butler's nroBt prominent citizens,
passed away at his home on North
Delaware street, in this city, at
ten o'clock in the evening, Decem
ber 25, 1916.
Doctor Joseph Everingham
was born at Uxhridge, Middlesex
County. England, April T, 1831.
In 1840. the family came f rOm
London, England, where they had
resided for a time, to the United
States and settled at West Point,
i . Iowa, where the father, who had
preceded the family to this coun
try, by several months, had pre
pared a home. They were forty
days in making the journey from
London to New York. The acci
dental drowning of the father
soon after-the arrival of the fam
jly in this country, left the moth
er with her three sons and one
daughter to enter upon an experi
nce of responsibility in the then
new world, which can be better
imagined than described. Her
uon, Joseph, was the second of
the three 'sons, but perhaps more
of the responsibility and the care
of the family fell upon him than
upon the . other children. The
story of this man's achievements.
tions, were it all told, would seem
to be unrivaled.
Before the family left England
the subject of. this briet sketch
seems to have attended an excel
lent boarding school for a brief
time, but at the time of the settle
ment in Iowa there were no edu
eational advantages except brie"
terms of what was then tailed
subscription schools. This am
hitious boy learned the printer's
trade. He learned telegraphy. He
did chores. He helped his moth
fir.. He studied medicine. He
managed to finish a medica
uourse at the Eclectic Medical In
wtitute in Cincinnati, Ohio, from
'which institution he graduated
June 10, 1854. After practicing
-Ins profession at West Point,
University of Pennsylvania, grad
uating from the Medical Depart
ment of the University March 28
"1857. In 1858 he returned to Lon
don and availed himself of the ad
vantages of a year's practice in
the hospitals of the great city.
. Returning to this country in
1859 he was married to Miss Mary
K. Steele ot West Point, who sur
vives her husband. In 1862 Dr.
- Everingham was appointed a sur
geon in the Federal Army, and
served in that capacity till the
close of the civil war, rising be
fore its close to the place of chief
surgeon of an army division.' Af
ter the civil war Dr. Everingham
conducted a successful practice of
nis profession in the old home
town at West Point up to the year
1873, when lie removed to Butler,
Missouri, where he continued the
practice of his profession up to
about twenty years ago, when he
sought to retire from active prac
tice.
Dr. Everingham always took a
deep interest in civic affairs and
when any movement was started
looking to the betterment of the
",ity or to humanity in general, he
was always ready to do his part,
He -was one of the founders of the
old Butler Academy and during
the life of that institution took a
great interest in its Avelfare. He
was for many years.secretary of
the pension board of this county.
Doctor and Mrs. Everingham'
have had four children born to
them. Willie, an only son, died
at the age of twelve. Francis
(Frankie) died when nine years
of age. Two daughters survive,
Mrs. S. M. Brown, of Kansas City,
and Mrs. J. B. Walton of Butler,
Missouri. Doctor Everingham be
came a Christian and joined the
Baptist church when a young
man. He was a most devout man.
His religion was to him a matter
of. the prof oundest concern. Af
ter ne oecame uname to near so
as to enjoy the public services of
God s House, and after he became
so feeble as to 1e unable to even
attend the public worship ot uoa,
he pursued his religious duties at
home, studying a portion of God's
Word each Sunday, and speeding
the day with his religious .paper
and Bible. For integrity, hon
esty, economy, frugality and sin
centy ur. isveringham s lire is
unimpeachable.
Funeral services, conducted by
Rev. Alexander of the Baptist
church were held at the home
Wednesday . , afternoon, , after
Oak Hill cemetery, where the
beautiful-burial services of the In
dependent Order of Odd Fellows,
of which the deceased had long
been a faithful member, were car
ricd out.
Rich Hill Has New High School
The new Rich Hill high school
has been completed and has been
turned over to the school board,
says the Rich Hill Review. The
amount voted for the building was
$29,00, which together with the
interest and incidental expenses
will make it cost about $30,000. .
The new building will be open
ed to the public and to the pat
rons on Jan. IXr 1917, with an ap
propriate program. The chief
speaker will be President Hend
ricks, of the Warrensburg State
Normal school. The music will
be furnished by the Dalamater
orchestra.
Asks Compulsory Insurance.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 23.
Laws requiring every person to
carry health insurance were ad-
LvomleiL by . Ruf us. M . Po tt s .. In
surance Superintendent , of Illi
nois, speaking at a recent confer
ence on social insurance. "With
a compulsory law," Mr. Potts
said, "the -benefits of health in
surance could be made universal
at much less than half the pres
ent cost, thus bringing more than
double returns in benefits. It
would be wholly improper, how
ever, to enact such a law. unless
l)Hf State provided a system by
which the insurance could be ob
tained at actual cost.

DISASTROUS FIRE
Two Buildings on the East Side
' of the Square Burned Early
Wednesday Morning'
Loss About
$12,000.
'Die second disastrous fire of
the year visited Butler Wednes
day morning about two o 'clock
when the two buildings on the
East side of the square owned by
the Powers estate were ' entirely
destroyed, .together with most of
their contents.
The fire was first discovered in'
the rear of the Star Theater and
quickly spread to the building on
the South. The fire department
responded promptly but tho
flames had gained such headway
that little could be done except to
save t!j,e remainder of the build
ings in the block, south of where
the fire started, and at one time it
looked as though they were not
going to be able to-do that, with
the wind that was blowing from
the North.
The Star Theater , where the
fire started, is a complete loss.
Mr. Eggleson the owner, carried
$2,400 insurance, which will about
cover his loss. The second floor
was occupied by Dr. Crahtrce's
(.I't'ice which was a total loss, and
as j)r. Crabtree 'is on duty with
the troops on the border, Jt is not
known whether thercwjis-any in- -Kiiranec
or not. In 'the rear up
stairs Ihe United Drug Store had
a stock of wall paper and some
household goods belonging t
Clark Travis. There was $500 in
surance on the household goods.
. The ground floor of the build
ing on the south, which was also
owned by the Power estate, and
which was almost a total loss,
was occupied by the United Drug
Store, and Mr. Travis, the man
ager, estimates that his loss will
be about $6,000 with $5,000 in
surance. The show cases and
some of the stock was carried out
of the building and taken across,
the street to the court house
yaru.
The second floor was occupied
by the Bates County Record of
fice and Co office of B. F. Jeter,
.instieo, of. the' peace. The loss hf
Vne Jeter office was about $150,
which was covered by insurance.
The plant of the Record was a to
tal loss. All that was saved was
the rrld files, which were quit? val
uable as they extend back nearly
forty years and contain a good
history of the development of
Bates county, and the mailing
list. It is not known how much
insurance there is as Mr. Atkeson
is-m Columbia, visiting his chil
dren, and has not yet been heard
from.
The loss on the two buildings
will be about $7,500, with $2,000
insurance.
Thirty-six years ago, in the fall
of 1880, a fire-8tarted in the same
building and destroyed almost the
entire block.
S. F. AVarnock informs us that,
new, modern business buildings
will be immediately erected to
take the place of those burned.
