WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Con
tinuation that Gen. Carranza has re-
ailed his ambassador-designate to
ihr Fnited States, Filsen Arrer.don
)!.., w;-s received in Mexican circles
today. Specific denial, howfver, was
made that this action was in any
way nmiuTtcd with the refusal of
Carranza to sinn the protocol. It
wax stated that the real reason was
tii.- failure of the United States to
! Ambassador Fletcher, who had
been confirmed by the senate as
tivoy t Mexico, to his post of duty
tlore.
WASHINGTON. Dec. lS. The
administration today fared the most
serious situation In regard to Mex
i( o that it has confronted since
American troops were ordered
i'cross the border in pursuit of Villa.
Information has reached here that
On. Carrar.za has refused to ac
i pt the agreement reac hed by the
joint commission at Atlantic City
for
the conduct of future relation
et.ven his government ana the
Fnited States.
The next step by the administra
tion will be decided this week or
early next, when the three mem
bers of the American section of the
i cm mission confer here.
From sources close to members
of the commission, it was learned
today that the most probable course
v. nl be recognition of Francisco
Villa as a revolutionary leader, re
moving him from the status of a
I audit.
May Hen-all Troops.
If this course is followed, one of
th- objections raised by On. Car-lan-.a
to the protocol understanding
will bo removed, as the American
troops will be withdrawn. The ob-
tiöp. cf the 'Iirst chief to keep-
j ci-
iniC
niericui troops on Mexican soil
c stcriblv "to got Villa." was that
it constituted a violation of the sov
ereignty of Mexico. Military experts
here declare that the presence of
the column has been in reality a
bar to the activities of Villa as he
dare not enture west of the posi
tion occupied by Gen. Persuings
command, insuring Carrar.za con
ti id of that portion f northern Mex
ico. I.ui.-s Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican section of the commission,
is expei ted to present today to

j Delto Carrying
Coal When Sunk
By Submarine
International News Service;
RFRLIN, via Sayvllle wireless,
Dec. 2S. An explanation of the
linking of the Norwegian steamer
Delto by a German submarine has
been given to the American ambassa
dor, James W. Gerard. It was ex
plained that the Delto was under
charter to the Italian government
and was carrying coal when de
stroyed. "The conjecture expressed by the
American government that the lives
of American citizens on board the
Delto had been put in jeopardy was
not justified." the German govern
ment declares.
The following was given out
: throuch the Overseas News agency:
"After an investigation made hy
the German naval authorities it has
been learned that the Delto was
chartered by the Italian government
for the transportation of coal. She
was stopped on Oct. 12 about 4 0
miles soutneast of Cape Polos and
sunk by artillery fire for assisting
the enemy in a way contrary to
neutrality. After the German com
mander had taken possession of the
ship's papers he caused the crew to
get into boats. Half an hour was
given for this purpose. The v,vath
er was clear and bright."
