"On the left bank of the Menie,"

ZIG-ZAG IN
DARK SAVES HER
Raiders Supposed To Be
German Vessels That
Slipped from Kiel.
Memhcrs nf the crew of the Venezia.
! the Fabre Ine freighter whieh ar
' rived in port yesterday, brought with
them the stnry of how their ship waa
attaeked 700 miles off I'ape Raee nn
April 29 hy two eommeree raiders, from
whieh she only esraped after aeven
i hours' flight. Among those who told
of the Bttack were twenty Americans
who were returning to this country
af'er taking a shipment of horses t'>
Kurope.
They eseaped, they said. only because
the ship was coming in hallast and
eould mak" rer fastest spee.l.
The raiders were (ierman ahipe, the
crew believed. because th? Venezia
' drew their fire while fiy\r.g the French
colors.
One of the pursuers, the men said
was ennvoying two smaller boati,
thought to he submarines. If was the
opinion of those on board that 'Jer
j many is beginning a new submarine
'policy in conformity with her latest
promise to the I'nited States. Her plRn |
is evidently to maintain with "mother
i ghips" several submarines not far frorr.
' the American coast, and keep with them
a sw.fter packet ship to overhaul and
| warn ships of her enenv.es.
Kr,ti.=h N'aval Reserve nffirer* in
j this harbor said last night that the
two raiders probably had eseaped from
. Kiel on the night of Februcrv 28 in ;
| companv with t.he Greif, whieh was
Runk on the following mornine in the
Xorth Sea by the Britiah auxiliary
eruirrer Andes.
Four raiders got out at that time.
nnd the sighting of the two bv th?
Venezia on April 29 leaves one more to |
be nccounted for.
("aptain Boniface of the Venezia ar.d .
' the other officers were very reticent |
when rjuestioned about the attack. but ,
a member of the crew told the follow?
ing story of the incident:
"Ir was a little after noon when the.
capta.n sifjhted a su.picious lookinfl
ship about four miles ahead and to
por'. She seemed to be of about tflOO
trna. nnd had two masts and one fun- j
rel. Soon after he made out throuphj
hia teleseope another larjjcr ?hin tO |
Marhoard. and he eould see two little
boats with her that looked like sub?
marines. None of them were flyitig
flara.
?As soon as she saw us coming tne
first ship started toward us and sig
nflled us to stop. But the eaptain
sheared off sharp and ordered full j
stef.ni ahead. We hadn't been makirig |
more than 12 knots before that, but
ranfrer near the ellgineer munaged
;ee7.e out 14. because we were !
travelllBg light.
'?When we turned off the twe boats |
shead had a short conference; then tbe j
brst one put after BB. She looked lik*
a fast packet ship. They had evidentb
decided that the submannea couldn'ti

No co-operation is possiblc between the forces of the Car?
ranza government in Mexico and General Pcrshing's army in
the field. That is the fact which makes the conference here
between Obregon and Scott so fatuous. It is the fact which,
if not heeded, will lead us deeper and deeper into the mire of
this Mexican situation.
All Northern Mexico is in a state of anarchy. It is neither
Vi'lista nor Carranzista?all troops are united against us,
ready and eager to attaek us if they think they can gain an
advantage.
Do not mistake that I counsel immediate opposition to
the Mexican government troops, any "avenging" of Parral, or
even that final policing of Mexico by us which every thinking
man who knows the situation believes is some day inevitable.

General Scott was informed that the
Mexicans nia'anj, the tnple raid were
believed to be (arranza troopa, and that
they had recrossed into Mexieo at a
point near Terhngua. It ;s said that
General Scott laforBBOd Oeneral Obre

that the troops whieh made the raid
were former i arranza troops. He ed
mitted tha: the raid formed the sub
;?ct of discussion at the conference.
It is understood that he made a very
plain and determmed talk to the Mex
ican Mimster of War.
General Be!l was a.lv.aed 'o night
that the attack upon Glenn Springsand
Boquilla. is believed ?o have been led
by ( ol.nel Cervante*. a Villa com
mander, who led the attack upon Co

cent battle with Americans at Santa

border attack.
Kaida AfTect Parley.
Signiticancc in connection w.th the
raids is attached by army men here to
?he d>appearance flfteen days ago of
the entire garrison of ('arranza aoldiera
stat'.oned at San V'incente, oppoaite H..
quilla-.. It was reported at the time
that these soldier. had <!e?erted_ the
larranzista rause for that of Villa.
The fact that the raidera attacked the
American soldiers at Glenn Springs
arith cnea of "Vi.a Villa!" ard "Vi\a
(arranza!" is taken to lr.dicate that
the band was made up of Villistas and
men from the San Vineente garnson.
Army men generally are enraged
0\er the newe-t Mex.in ..utrage and
it is understood that the orders riven
hv General Kunston to (oionel B
are to go \n after the raiders and get
them, no matter how far into Mexieo
it may be r.eeessary to go or what
Mexican town. it may be necessary to
