The report of the fire department
at Tuesday's council meeting brought
out the fact that an alarm turned In
because a little steamer runabout
caught fire cost the city several dol
lars. The entire volunteer fire de
partment turned out and each collect
ed 75 cents due him under the pres
ent agreement. If citizens would In
form the fire department of the na
ture of a fire and its seriousness when
phoning In an alarm it would be un
necessary to call out the entire de
partment for minor blazes, thus sav
ing the city a few dollars.
The police department was not as
busy as usual handling hoboes last
month, the travel falling off by sev
eral hundred. However, activity In
other departments and an unusually
large number of arrests kept them
busy.
Twenty-five business men left the
doors of their stores unlocked on one
or more occasions during the past
month, according to the police report.
On several occasions the absent-minded
business men were hauled out of
the downy couch In the early morning
hours by the patrolmen to come down
and lock their doors.
After having fried hundreds of
eggs and cooked innumerable flap
jacks, the electric cooker at the mu
nicipal plant has gone on the bum
and the city dads authorized the pur
chase of another. The old cooker did
good service for over five years.
"Ashland stands In a class by Itself
for fire protection," said James N.
McCune, secretary of the state board
of fire underwriters. "You have the
highest pressure in your two-Inch
mains of any city In Oregon." Which
says a great deal for the Ashland wa
ter system.
The majority of the council ex
pressed themselves as most anxious
to provide the $500 asked by the dedi
cation celebration committee; -
Councilman Banta Is worried over
the regrettable fact that while cer
tain lads of Ashland who are becom
ing a little too rambunxious In their
behavior will probably have to be dis
ciplined in the near future, legally
toys of under 14 years of age cannot
be placed in the "public jail," accord
ing to his understanding. He believes
that a night of confinement would do
some of the kids a whole lot of good,
and upon his suggestion the city at
torney has been asked to render his
opinion on the matter. Mr. Banta
suggested the providing of a "private
Jail" for boys. The matter was
brought to his attention through the
mistreating of little children by a
13-year-old bully.
Low Railroad Rates
Will Swell Crowds
The Southern Pacific company has
announced a rate of one fare for the
round trip for Sunday trips between
any stations between Glendale and
Ashland where the one way fare is
fifty cents or more. This co-operation
upon the part of the Southern
Pacific will mean a great increase in
the number of Sunday visitors to
Ashland.
The Sunday fare will go into ef
fect on May 14th, and continue
throughout May, June and July.
Tickets may be bought for the one
fare price for the round trip on Sun
day only and are good for return only
on the same day.
Under the new fare Sunday visit
ors to Ashland will be able to make
the round trip from Central Point
for fifty cents, from Grants Pass
for $1.35, and in the same ratio
from other Southern Oregon sta
tions. The rates will be advertised by
the Southern Pacific company and
should mean trainloads of Sunday
visitors from lower valley points dur
ing the hot weather.

Land Grant Bill
Favorably Reported
The latest developments in the O.
& C. land grant case was the favor
able report to the house by the house
lands committee at Washington, D.
C, of a bill under which the federal
government would take over for
$2.50 an acre about two million acres
of timber land In Oregon which comes
under the land grant.
The land, granted to the railroad
under the stipulation that none of it
should be sold for more than $2.50
per acre, will be resold to timber In
terests or opened to homesteaders
where the timber Is not abundant,
by the government. Jackson county
has several hundred thousand acres
of the land grant and is one of the
counties most vitally Interested.
Suits to recover several million- dol
lars from the railroad on lands al
leged to have been sold by It for more
than the stipulated price also would
be authorized by the measure. Twen
ty per cent of the amount so recov
ered or received from sales of the re
maining lands taken over would go
to the state of Oregon for school pur
poses, 30 per cent to the respective
counties for roads, 40 per cent to the
reclamation fund and 10 per cent to
the federal treasury to offset expenses
of the proceeding.

Auto Camp's Fame
Is Nation Wide
. ..The amount of publicity which is
accruing to Ashland through the es
tablishment of the auto camp here
last year, is becoming more evident
every day.
All over the United States the Ash
land camp is talked of by motorists
wbo have returned home Irom a
coast trip. The many motoring
magazines of the country have near
ly all printed articles telling of the
camp.
The latest incident which corrobor
ates reports of the widespread fame
of the Litbla park resting place for
motorists comes from Washington,
D. C, where In a speech before the
American Civic Association by Cyrus
Kehr, which was printed by the U.
S. Government printing office and
distributed all over the nation, the
following mention was made of Ash
land's auto camp:
Recently In the city of Ashland,
Ore.,. In a public park, camp lots
were marked by suitable boundaries
and the free use of these, including
water and lights, granted to auto
mobile tourists bringing their own
tents.
This remark concerning Ashland Is
particularly notable because of the
fact that Ashland is the only city in
the West mentioned in the speech
and the only city mentioned in the
campground connection.
Mr. Kehr's speech was on "A Na
tional System of Highways and Land
scape Gardening." and was also sub-
mitted to the senate of the United
States by Senator Shields, of Ten
nessee. Many Attend .

30,000 Drink Lithia
. During Past Month
-"Approximately thirty thousand
people 'drank at the mineral water
fountains of Ashland during the
month of April.
The amazing total of over 2,900
cups were dispensed by the ma
chines at the fountains during this
month. On four different occasions
men kept tab on the visitors at the
fountains, finding that an average
of one in ten people patronized the
cup machines.
These figures are most conserva
tive since but two cup machines were
Installed for the first two weeks, the
other six being added for the last
two weeks. The record month runs
from March 25, when the first ma
chines were installed, to April 25.
Since this was a month of much
cold weather and rain the astonish
ing total is only an Index of the
crowds which will drink llthia and
visit the parks during the hot Bum
mer months.
The total receipts for the month
from the cup machines was $63,59.
A dim comprehension of the revenue
which the cup dispensers will bring
during the warm summer months
may be gained from the realization
of the amount taken In during the
past month. The April amount rep
resents 847 nickels and 2124 pen
nies or a total of 2971 coins.
One vendor at the llthia spring
took in over seven dollars on the
seventh of April. On four or five
other days the receipts were almost
as great.

Nineteen Autoloads
Of Gypsies Coming
Nineteen autoloads of gypsies will
arrive in Ashland some time this
week, bound for an unknown destina
tion In Oregon, where a Pacific coast
reunion of gypsies will be held. The
wanderers will then go east to Min
neapolis, where they will ultimately
meet the gypsy "big chief," Slatcho
Demetro, on July 4. About ten auto
loads passed through yesterday and
were the center of much Interest dur
ing their brief stay In the city.
The Redding Searchlight tells of
the band as follows:
"The entire band, containing 33
women, 42 men, 39 children, nine
dogs and one rabbit, were traveling
in automobiles. The majority of the
machines were of standard make,
costing In the neighborhood of $3000
or more. Each machine was piled
high with luggage, upon which the
occupants rode. The women were
dressed in the gaudy reds and yel
lows, while the men wore ordinary
suits. The little children wore dress
es such as Kipling describes in bis
"Gunga Din": 'The uniform 'e wore
was nothing much before, an' rather
less than 'arf o' that behind,' being
mostly wrapped with multi-colored
rags, the worse for wear.
"During their Btay at Marysvllle
the women started on a begging tour.
They secured little. One- of the
ragged urchins had giat delight
with a small rabbit he kept in a tea
pot. "The men of the party confided
that they Intended to make Chlco by
nightfall. All of them bemoaned the
high price of gasoline and were still
kicking because they had been com
pel led to pay 23 cents per gallon
south of Marysvllle."
Benton Bowers Not
Responsible for Recall
In Its issue of May 4 the Mail-Tribune
charged that Benton Bowers
launched the recall now being circu
lated for the recall of the Jackson
county court. The following open let
ter to that paper explains Itself:
Ashland, Ore., May 6, 1916.
Editor Mall-Tribune, Medford, Ore.
Dear Sir: I see In your Issue of
May 4, artlclo headed "Bowers
Launches Effort to Recall County
Court." Now, as a matter of fair
ness, I will ask you to state through
your columns that the report that I
am circulating recall petitions Is false
and without any foundation what
ever. I will state, since I have been a
member of the Tax League, that sev
eral men who were factors In getting
Judge Ton Velle elected came to me
in Medford with figures they clnlmed
to have taken from the county rec
ords, showing extravagance of the
county funds, rfnd asked If the Tax
League expected to accomplish any
good for the taxpayers of the county,
why they did not start a rocall; that
would ho the only relief. I replied
that If their figures and statements
were correct, and had I been as much
of a factor as they were In electing
Judge Ton Velle, I would take the
Initiative myself and not ask some
one else to rectify my mistakes. They
said all it needed was a start. I re
plied that it was up to those who
were responsible for his election to
start it.
Had I launched the recall, you
would have seen me in the fore
ground and not apologizing for being
there. But, the Tribune, in giving
me credit for launching the recall,
does bo In the hope of injuring me
politically. : i ;
Yours truly,
BENTON BOWERS.

Mathis Has Five
Great Messages
From Friday night to Sunday night
Evangelist Mathis brought five great
messages to largo audiences In which)
there were many men. Friday night
was Men's Night. In one section
gathered about 140 men. After Mrs.
Wolf and Vessey had sung "Jesus
Will," Mathis announced his text.
"Now Naaman, captain of the host of
the king of Syria, was a great man
was also a mighty man of valor,
but he was a leper." From this text
a message of Bin waB delivered with
great power and acceptance with the
audience. Often the evangelist was
applauded. "Men constantly live in
tho shadows because of what sin has
done In their lives." 1. "Sin has
made an unclean mind." "It Is an
awful thing to think evil thoughts."
2. "Sin makes unclean In word."
"If a leper had to cry unclean, should
not the law compel the man who ped
dles dirty, filthy stories to cry out,
'Unclean, Unclean'?" 3. "S!n makes
a man unclean In act." "A boy ought
to have just as good a chance to be
decent as a girl." "Tho fallen girl
Is no more fallen than tho young man
who put her down." "The average
mnn ought to live just as clean as his
wife."
On Saturday night after the sacred
concert Mr. Mathis found the begin
ning of his message In the words,
"The queen of Sheha came to Solo
mon; but a greater than Solomon Is
here." Then tho most of the message
clustered about two men In the New
Testament who were Interested In the
eternal question of eternal life. Nic
odemus came to Jesus by night, and
Jesus said to him, "Ye must be born
again." This spiritual life Is a great
mystery. So Is the natural life.
Things that are the greatest of mys
teries are nevertheless facts. When
Zachaeus found Christ he took Him
home with him. "What a marvelous
thing If every man In Ashland should
take Jesus home with him this Satur
day night!" 1
At the Sunday morning service Mf.
Vessey sang "Salvation." Say, by the
way, have you heard Vessey sing. He
Is certainly some s!nger. Come and
hear for yourself. After the "Love
Feast" of gathering the money for
the campaign expenses, which was
raised, Evangelist Mathis took his
audience back to that wonderful old
book of Genesis, to the text, "Abide
ye here with the ass, and I and the
lad will go yonder; and we will wor
ship and come again to you." "True
Worship" was the theme. "God
asked Isaac because he wanted Abra
ham." "People ought to spend time
preparing spiritually before going to
church as well as physically." "There
are two kinds of soakers, sermon
soakers and booze soakers. It Is ea
ler to save the latter." "Since God
has put us on the top of the earth ho
surely dll not Intend us to be
sponges." "If every church were a
warm-hearted church, poople could
not help becoming Christians." When
people come to church they do not
leave their business and cares behind
so that It in very difficult to get a
message to them from God, for they
are chuck full of other things.

Billings Crossing
Contract Delays
The contract submitted to the
county court by the Southern Pa
cific company regarding tho construc
tion of the subway crossing of the
Pacific Highway under tho Southern
Pacific track at the top of the Bil
lings hill, was deemed too drastic In
several respects, making the county
responsible for future damages that
might result from faulty construc
tion, and was rojected by Attorney
Evan Reamcs, representing the coun
ty court.
Attorney Reames and the county
court submitted a new contract to
the company and approval Is ex
pected from the S. P. officials within
the next week or so.
With the conclusion of the con
tract matter, nothing will stand In
the way of immediate beginning of
the construction work on the under
grade crossing and the paving of
the Billings hin. Every indication
points toward the Inauguration of
