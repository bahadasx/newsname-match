THE PATRIOT--As Manly Sees Him |
Congressman Tells Why
He Asks Income Tax Probe
By Oilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 8.

Kdward Keating of Colorado why
he has Introduced into congress
his resolution calling upon the
I'nited States government to in
vestigate the charges of income
tax frauds just made by Basil M.
Manly foi the newspapers served

said:
"I Introduced my resolution
largely because of my faith in
Basil M. Manly. Through his
work with the Walsh Industrial
relations commission, Manly has
demonstrated that he is an econ

defatigable investigator who, in
his researches, would display
neither fear nor favor.

"You may discount Mr. Munly's

"Three hundred and twenty
million dollars represents the to

This Movie Antidote
for "Swelled Head"
By Edgar 0. Wheeler
Any conceited young fellow
whose head has grown light with
unearned riches and power, who
has the Idea that he's just a little
better than anybody else, and
who has reached the opinion that
he has outclassed the good wife
who stood back of him when
things weren't so rosy, will get
some real profitable entertain
ment In "The Stepping Stone,''
at the Regent theater today.
"The Stepping Stone" is the
kind of a movie that wins, be
cause it is a true picture of life,
acted by real artists, staged with
extraordinary art and finish.

Albert lleresford, "the lamb,''

hadn't whimpered and let his
wife Mary do all his hard jobs for

that her husband had neglected.
Thereupon the big man deter

But riches and power were too
much for Albert's little soul, '.le

whole show and that Mary was
below his class, that when the
woman had served as a stepping
stone for her husband to climb,
her duty waa done. He told Mary
he was tired of her. She disap
peared.
It was then that the "bull"
came along and knocked the bot
tom out of the stock In which Ihe
"lamb" had plunged, just at the
time the "lamb" was thinking he
was a real money king.
What happened to the ungrate
ful soul that couldn't stand pow
er, when the props had been
knocked out from under It, Is ihe
story which Is holding the Re

And of course the "bull" loved
Mary, or he wouldn't have done
It all. A strong man and a strong
woman make the finest kind of a
love story.

Wilson Clashes With Senate
CLUB LEADERS
ENTHUSIASTIC
FOR A SURVEY
Letters received today by the editor of The Times
from officers of the Tacoma Commercial club not
only promise that The Times' suggestion for a build ,
ing and housing survey -will be taken up by the club, I
but voice enthusiasm for the project and bring out
many other interesting ideas.
For instance W. H. Paulhamus, the only trustee
who does not approve of the plan, suggested instead
that the building survey be left to various city of
ficials.
He then goes on to outline what he considers would
be a valuable undertaking for the club; namely, a
survey of the city by industries and an effort by the
club to help each industry solve its various problems.
Here are some of the letters:
Suggestion
Opportune,
Says Lyle
_.y J. T. S. Lyle
Trustee, Commercial Club.
Your propoeal of I building
anil housing survey of Tacoma
should he adopted at once.
The suggestion is most oppor
tune at this time when Tacoma
is entering upon a new period of
building activity.
It will be no easy task for the
committee you suggest because
frequently the old or second
class buildings bring in the great
est net Income.
However, 1 have confidence In
the civic pride of the property
owners in Tacoma and feel ti at
with your support the conimltteo
could accomplish much along the
lines you suggest.
I shall be pleased to present
the matter to the executive board
of Tacoma Commercial club md
Chamber of Commerce at its
meeting on Tuesday next.
'Die subject ia one that would
naturally come within the civic
bureau.
Speaking as one of the board
I feel that your proposal will
meet with favor by all the mem
bers.
Your policy of in,-king sugges
tions for the good of Tacoma
means much to Tacoma and 1
trust that you will keep on wit£
the good work. ■'- •
In Line With
Clean-up Idea
By E. G. Griggs
Trustee, Commercial Club.
The suggestion Is in line with
the general heautiflcaUon of the
city and clean up, which has been
advocated from tlme~to tyme.
Citizens should actively Inter-;
est themselves along the lines
you suggest, and also on the lines
of seeing that vacant lots are
cleaned up and not,a, continued
disgrace.
We have done some little work
In this line, and I am Inclined
to think it will require the activ
ity of all, to bring about the re
sults which we all desire. Par
ticularly In the tourist season, la
this beneficial.
Points to Big
Building Gain
By S. M. Collins
Trustee, Commercial Club.
A promising sign in the city o(
Tacoma Is found in .the building
permits of April, 1916, whlej.
show an Increase of about Ma
per cent over April, 191..
The reorganized Tacoma Cor_
merclal club and Chamber ot
Commerce Is thoroughly demo
cratic in character, in govern
ment and in its endeavors to do
thin-js for this community, and
your suggestion for a building
and housing survey of Tacoma
should he referred to the mem
bers councllo f the club, whereup
on their recommendation. It could
fee placed In proper committee.
Paulhamus
Also Has a
> Survey Idea
Sy W. H. Paulhamus
Trustee, Commercial Club.
i belle-re that If T«mmm __4|
the rlghl kind of a fire chief the!
wi, |< you outline could be done!
by I;im.
Tlie Commercial club of course,
Would not hiive any authority,!
ami ihe chances are that they!
would get into a serious dispute
wiili the cily council, in an effort
to urge ihe tearing down of a
|tuuitlty Of shaclis.
In my judgment, if you would
spend your energy on the city
council, on the health depart
ment, and on the chief of the fire)
department you would come near
er getting results.
Permit me to suggest some
thing that 1 believe the Com
mercial club could and should do
and that will he very beneficial
to the city of Tacoma.
Ip to the present time there
apirt-ars to be a disposition on the
pari of the board of trustees to
coniinually talk boosting for Ta
coma, and by boosting tliey ap
pear to mean advertising to the
world what a wonderful place Ta
conia is, with a view of seeking
more manufacturing plants und
more settlers.
To be perfectly frank with you,
my activity as a member of the
board of Trustees of the Com
mercial club is extremely limit
ed, for the reason that i appar
ently do not have much influence
with the present board.
In other words- their Ideas
and ny ideas do not run along
the same channels, nnd I am not
making tills statement in a com
plaining mood, hut because, I do
not believe that we understand
tht) problem alike.
In my judgment the Com
im i. ml club can obtain the
fcesl results by firm making
4 complete list of all the dif
ferent line* of business In
}»c city of Tacoma.
V- example say the shoemak
er* , hen the blacksmiths, und
thii»i ihe painters, In fact every
other line of trade.
A meeting should then be
c-iih it for example, all of the
blacksmiths in Tacoma, for the
purpose of ascertaining what
their real problems are, and how
the Commercial club of Tacoma
can be of assistance to the blaek
siul-iis of Tacoma.
Bow they are now buying their
supplies, how they are making|
tln'lr collections, and what profiti
If lay. is being made, and wheth
er I there Is a general system
adapted so that a blacksmith
really knows whether he is mak
ing! a profit or not.
In other words, the Commer
cial club can accomplish greater
results by helping assist the vari
ous lines of Industry now present
In the city of Tacoma. No dif
ference how many blacksmiths
we have In Tacoma, If they are
not making a success of their bus
iness they will not be an asset.
The Commercial club can and
should assist all of the different
lines of business to Ret on their
feet, because a successful mer
chant, no difference how small
his business is, Is an asset as
