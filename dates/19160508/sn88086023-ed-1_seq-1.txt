was learned on high authority that
Wilson will not make peace proposals
until the promised, offensive of the

of this.

edly mentioned the peace reference in
the note, saying It afforded Wilson an
opportunity to. make a move definite
ly In the way of peace. One paper
said that perhaps the passage in the
note will give Wilson an opportunity
to publish the .terms of peace which
he believes would be possible.
The Liberal Gazette said: "Wilson
can perhaps do more than merely
maintain German-American peace.
Fate has thrown such unheard of
power in this maifs lap that he could
do other things for bleeding and suf
fering humanity. The German reply
shows the way."
A majority Of the papers did not
emphasise the peace reference, pos
sibly fearing that British Journals
might accept the comment as an In
dication of German weakness
Though there unquestionably Is a
strong undercurrent or peace talk In
Berlin, officials resent the intimation
from Washington rsusotty that Holl
weg asked Gerard to cancel his vaca
tion so as to transmit peace offers.
The feeling here Is that the war should
end in the fall.

Military critics declared that the

fight west of the Meuse attained Its
greatest violence yesterday. The Ger

threatening to surround It. The same
method at attack was used east of the
