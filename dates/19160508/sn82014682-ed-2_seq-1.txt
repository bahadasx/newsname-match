BACKUP $98.55
OF FORBES BILL
Forbes Was Informed By At
torney-General That Dinner
, Account Was Illegal
"It has been intimated in a ques
tfon asked ne that there has been a
misuse of public funds. I don't know
anything about any misuse of funds
but I do know that I propose to back
up the expenditure of $98.55. I do not
know of any one in my end of the
business who has not spent a pretty
good per cent of his salary to keep
the . government going. By this I
mean that I will back up this item of
Mr. Forbes accounts out of my own
pocket'
Thus declared Governor Pinkham
today while testifying in the injunc
tion suit brought by Arthur A. Wild
er to prevent the payment of $98 5 in
curred by Charles R. Forbes, superin
tendent of pubtic works, during his
recent trip to Washington, D.( C. The
suit is one of four launched by Wilder
against the governor, Forbes and oth
er, territorial , officials, all seeking to
prevent the payment of expenses.
-Prior to the beginning' of the trial
riimitt Tnitva Rtnort HfnlAf1 n mntion
' to dissolve the temporary Injunction
and dismiss me case, lie suggested
that all the suits be tried together
but Attorney-general I. M. Stainback
stated that this would be impossible
The court then ruled that the cases
be tried separately. ; '
. The suit now on trial Involves 'the
expenditure of $98.55 for a dinner to
senators and others in the national
capital. There was Introduced in evi
dence a cablegram from the governor
to Forbes authorizing the latter to ex
pend $100 in this respect
Called to the witness stand, Forbes
testified he was Informed , by the at-torney-generai's
department that the
dinner bill could not be paid.
"I said it would be all right," Forbes
testified, "and added that, if that was
the caae, I would pay the bill out of
nly own pocket I am still of the opin
ion that the bill will have to be paid
out of my own pocket"" he added.
Governor Pinkham was asked
whether he intended to have the $100,
mentioned in the cablegram, paid out
of the funds of the territory.
1 . object to that question because
it is leading," Bald Governor Pinkham.
He added, however, "I authorized the
expenditure and expected it would be
paid out of the funds of the territory
for the benefit of Oahu and no one
else. - ' . - - :y
"Did you ever investigate Into the
legality of the bill?" the governor was
asked.',..,;;- - ; ;v ;.
"I did not," he answered. "I had
no data on which to make it'
The governor added that, Bince he
waa Informed that the bill was not il
legal, he has paid no attention to it
"I propose to pay it out of my own
pocket,- he added. "I do not propose
to see Mr. Forbes pay it out of his
pocket";''-, v-'---'
Further hearing of the case was
to be had this afternoon. It is not
expected that Judge Stuart will hand
down a decision until the hearings oi
all four cases are finished.
