Other developments jf, yesterday
are described textua'ly as follows:
"The night passed quietly on the
remainder of the front except in the
region of the wood of Remieres and
the wood of Joury, west of Pont-A-Mousson,
where our artillery was very
active.
"Two German aeroplanes have been
brought down as a result, of aerial ene
counters in the region of Verdun. Ctoe
of them fell not far from Ornes and
the other, seriously damaged, was
compelled to land south of Azannes."
Germans Open New Attack.
After seven days of battle the Ger
mans are making a new attack before
Verdun with another formidable army.
Fighting, almost equal in violence to
that of the beginning of March, is in
progress on both banks of the Meuse.
The principal effort of the Germans
is being directed against Dead Man's
Hilt Following the Napoleonic policy
of attempting to turn what cannot be
carried by frontal attack the Germans
with a whole army corps, made the as
sault by way of the ravine between
Hill 304 and Dead Man's Hill, seeking
to crush In the French line along a
front of one and one-half miles. The
ground there is favorable for attack
and the French commander, aware of
the weakness of the position, placed
one of his best trained army corps at
that placed. This corps disposed of
the initial attack without ceding any
important ground but the battle is still
raging and according to the latest ad
vices the result will not be known till
some time today.
Deliver Four Charges.
East of the Meuse the Germans de
livered four attacks on a front of 2,000
yards, each advance being made by a
different Prussian regimefit

the other side cf the river and as in
conclusive. Genera Nrve!le,'wtnse promotion to

charge at such a critical time, is a man
of 80. He comes from Tulle in the
Correze department. General Nivelle
is one of the discoveries of the war.
At the outbreak of hostilities he was
in command of the Fifth regiment of
artillery. General Joffre soon singled
him out for a leading role. He was
promoted to be general of brigade on
Oct 24, 3512 and shortly after that
was ptaced in command of the 61st in
fantry division. On Dec 23. 1915, he
received his three stars and at the
same time was appointed commander
of the Third army corps.

today:
"On the occasion of the Easter fes
tival Emperor William sent an auto

The correspondent says he obtains
this information from a circular just
issued by the German Humanity

kings of Bavaria and Saxony, who had
prolonged audiences with Cardinal
Gasparri, papal secretary of state.

ORDER RAID
AT RIG BEND
STIRS BAKER
New Attack by Mexican
Bandits Rouses Secretary
: of War Department.
HOLDS TO AGREEMENT
Gives Funston Authority to
Take Steps Necessary to
Pursue Band.
Washington, May S. Secretary
Baker stated today that the war
department considers the agree,
ment under which the army be
gan pnrsuit of Villa bandits still
in operation and that under its
terms General Funston will take
any steps necessary to pnrsne the
nana which raided the Big Bend
country, without further instruc
tions. A new American expedition may al
ready be across the Mexican border in
pursuit of the bandits who raided
Glenn Springs and Alpine, Texas, last
week. Secretary Baker said today he
bad received a report from General
Funston as to steps taken in that di
rection but declined to reveal its con
tents. He said General Funston's or
iginal orders still stood, however, and
they gave him authority to cross when
ever the need arose.
Has Funston's Report.
Secretary Baker on his return from
Cleveland today was prepared to act
on General Funston's report that three
American soldiers and two civilians
had been killed in a raid by Mexican
bandits at Glenn Springs and Boquil
las, Texas.
Hurried dispatch of additional,
troops to the raided district and pos
sibly another punitive expedition were
in prospect. Army officers considered
it possible, though not entirely prob
able, that Villa might have partici
pated in the attack which occurred
Friday night. That more than 500 out
laws might be hiding in the hills
south of the border was suggested in
a message from General Funston. Of
ficials hoped the new Taid would help
to hasten the signing by General Obre
gon, war minister for Carranza, of the
proposed agreement under which
United States troops might continue to
stay in Mexico and cooperate with
Carranza in hunting Mexican bandits,
farranza's Strong District
This was thought particularly de
sirable considering that the latest as
sault on American towns was made
from the Big Bend section of northern
Coahuila, a state in which General
Carranza asserted his soldiers had full
control. The apparent ease with which
the raid was conducted gave rise to
fears that it might be duplicated at a
number of localities where conditions
are similar.
Bandits Flee Southward,
Alpine, Texas, May 8. Piecing
through the wild mesas of northern
Coahuila, the seventy or more bandits
that raided the American settlement
of Glenn Springs and Boquillas last
Friday, killing three cavalrymen and
a nine-year-old boy, are believed to
be heading into the interior today,
many miles from the scene of their
depredations.
A posse from Marathon and a de
tachment of 23 troopers of the Four
teenth cavalry are said to have fol
lowed the trail of the Mexicans into
Coahuila, while other reports have it
that the Americans have not forded the
Rio Grande 85 miles from here but
are waiting at the river for reinforce
ments. Captain Caspar Cole is hur
rying to Boouillas to take command
while two companies of the Fourteenth
cavalry and a machine gun company
are expected here or at Marathon this
afternoon when they will head south
ward to the Big Bend country.
Pursuit 'ot Certain.
It is not known here whether the
new troops contemplate a long pur
suit of the bandits into Mexico or will
be placed as an additional guard along
the border. Reports here say there
are many bandits operating between
Boijnillas and Presidio, just south of
the Rio Grande.
It is about a three days' march from
either Marathon or Alpine to the Rio
Grande and as the bandits already
have a three days start only a re
lentless pursuit will bring the Ameri
cans up with them.
Nothing has been heard of Private
Roscoe Tyree, who was last seen as
he ran from the adobe house, where
he and his eight companions for three
long hours fought against the Mexi
cans and then fled because the roof
of the house was sot aflame by fire
balls.
Private Croskem. who was in the
fight, ihinks that Tyree was wounded
and wandered off in the hills where
he died. Others believe that Tyree
was captured and carried off a pris
oner by the bandits and probably kill
ed later.

Report Teut
Raiders Are
Loose Again
New York, May 8. Captain Guy
Gaunt, naval attache of the British
embasse at Washington, today inves
tigated the report that two German
commerce raiders, accompanied by
two submarines, are operating in the
trans-Atlantic steamship lanes off the
Azores islands, about 1,800 miles from
New YoTk.' The story was brought
here yesterday by the steamship Vcn
ezia of the Fabre line, from Bordeaux.
Members of the crew said one of the
raiders fired several shots at the Ven
ezia on April 28, but was unable to
overtake her. The naval attache said
he intended to wire at once to Halifax
so that British cruisers now in Amer
ican waters would be warned.
"They will know in Halifax if any of
our cruisers or auxiliaries are in the
region reported by Captain Boniface,"
said Captain Gaunt
"If these are really German raid
ers escaped from Kiel, they will have
a short lease of life. Undoubtedly
there will be great excitement in Lon
don when the news reaches there that
German raiders are loose again."
One of the men on the Venezia said
the vessel that fired on them flew no
flag and that she was accompanied by
a larger vessel which in turn was con
voying the two submarines. The larger
of the raiders did not join in the chase.
CHICAGO AND OCEAN
TALK BY WIRELESS
Chicago, May 8. Communication by
wireless telephone between Chicago

said to have been completely suc
cessful. Officials of the naval training
station at Lake Bluff, just nort h of the

who was on the bridge of the battleship
New Hampshire in Chesapeake Bay.
The conversation was part of the
series of experiments which the navy
department is conducting and followed
a demonstration in which officials in
Washington on Saturday talked with
various naval stations throughout the
country.

PERPLEXED
WILSON SCORES
BRANDEIS' FOES
Letter of President Giving Reasons for
His Nomination Is Read in
Senate 'o Tote Taken.
Washington, May 8. President Wil
son's letter giving his reasons for nom
inating Louis Brandeis for the supreme
court and urging confirmation was
read to the senate judiciary committee
today by Chairman Culberson, but no
vote was taken as had been expected
and no time was fixed for one.
President Wilson characterized the
charges against his nominee as "in
trinsically incredible to any one who
really knows Mr. Brandeis" and de
clared they "proceeded for the most
part from those who hated Mr. Bran
deis because he had refused to be
serviceable to them in promotion of
their own selfish interests and from
those whom they had prejudiced and
misled." The president added that the
"propaganda in this matter has been
very extraordinary and very distress
ing to those who love fairness, and
value the dignity of the great profes
sions." The president wrote that he believed
the reports of the sub-committee which
investigated the Brandeis nomination
had already made it plain that the
charges were unfounded. He added
that he had tested Mr. Brandeis by
seeking his advice on perplexing pub
lic questions and had dealt with him
in matters "where. nice questions of
honor and fair play, as well as large
questions of justice and the public
benefit were involved."
He closed by saying that "I beg that
your committee will accept this nomi
nation as coming from me, quick with
a sense of public obligation and re
sponsibility." FILIPINO AGAINST
FREEING COUNTRY
Washington, May S. Manuel Que
zon, Philippine commisioner who has
been urging Philppine independence,
told President Wilson today that he
and his followers had abandoned the
idea of freedom in the near future and
hoped congress would pass the house
bill giving a greater share of self-government
to the islands but setting no
date for independence.
Mr. Quezon urged the president to
support the house bill and not insist
upon the Clarke amendment approved
by the senate which would give inde
pendence by 1920. T. R. Yaugco, pres
ident of the Philippine chamber of
commerce, saw the president with Mr.
Quezon. The whole question was dis
cussed at length and the president
promised to consult with senate and
house leaders.

in the House
Washington, May 8. A- standing
army of 250,000 men, provided for in
the senate amendment bill to the army
bill was rejected by the house today,
221 to 142. The house till provided
for 140,000 men.
The senate's plan to provide for a

ed today by the house by a vote of 251
to 109.
Debate on the conferees' report
began with a speech by Representa
tive Caplin, ranking republican of the
committee, approving the larger force
and opposing the provisions of the
house bill to increase the national
guard. He said it would be impossible
to recruit the guardsmen proposed and
endorsed sections of the senate bill au
thorizing an army of 250,000 men and
for a volunteer army.
These two provisions, said Mr. Kahn,
are up.

was the only woman in Glenn Springs
when the bandits swooped down upon
the little settlement near midnight. In
the flickering lights of the burning
buildings, she and her husband stole
out of their house and fled in safety to
the hills, where they wandered around
until morning.
Telling her friends of her exper

"A fusillade of shots roused my hus
band and myself. Peering out of the
window, we saw the forms of men
moving in the direction of the sol
dier's little camp.
"The flashes of their rifles were .ike
lightning streaks against the darkness
and we knew there must be a number
of Mexican attacking the place. Mr.
Kllis told me not to strike a match or
make any light for fear of attracting
the attention of the bandits.
"In the darkness we hunted for our
clothes and quietly dressed. The ban
dits were now firing rapidly at the
adobe house where I later learned the
soldiers of Troop A made their stand.
"We could here the shots of the
Mexicans and saw a party of them

Washington, May' 8. A note to
Germany lias practically been
completed and probably wfll go '

be made public soon afterward.
It is understood it will be brief, in
forming tier-many that as long as
the new instructions to submarine
commanders are observed diplo
matic relations will be continued,
but tht the Fnited States cannot
allow Germany to dictate its
negotiations with Great Britain.
The president worked on the pro-j

Lansing last night. It is understood
officials are so far agreed on the pol
icy to be pursued that it will not be
necessary to wait for the cabinet
meeting tomorrow.
While the German note has averted
for the present at least, a break tn dip
lomatic relations, it was said today
that the president was not ""iM
with the apparent conditions attached
by Germany. The United States stands
by its demand that Germany cease beH
attacks on vessels in violation of in
ternational law, regardless of nego

Great Britain over the food blockade.
Some of his advisers wanted him to
make no reply to the German note and
