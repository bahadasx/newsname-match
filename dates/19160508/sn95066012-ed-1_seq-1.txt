Austria's Official Version of the Tor
pedoing of the Imperator.
Washington, May 7. The Aus
trian Government, tiirough American
Ambassador Penfleld at Vienna, has
furnished the United States, with its
erSion of the attack by one of its sub

erator, from which two Americans,
one -of them wounded, were lescued.
Austria denies that the vessel was
fired upon without warning, as was

the attack made to the State Depart
ment by the American Consul at Bar
celona, Spain. According to her ver
sion the submarine fired two warning
shots at the Imperator, which failed
to Ifeave to. A third shot, it is de
clared, went through the rigging. Then
the members of the barks' crew put
away in a boat and approached the
submarine. A wounded man who was
found to be in the boat was taken
aboard the submarine and received
medical treatment. Later, the sub
marine took the boat In tow and aban
doned it only when near a steamer.
It was authoriatively stated tonight
that the United States would proceed
to establish the facts in the case, with
view of taking further action should
it be warranted.
The United States still has pending
with Austria negotiations over the
case of the American tank ship Petro

RUTLAND WON 18 TO 10
High School Baseball Team Defeated
at Morgan Park Saturday Afternoon
Bennington high school lost a base
ball game at Morgan park Saturday
afternoon to Rutland high school by a
score of 18 to 10. The game was
characterized by more clean hitting
than Is usually seen in preparatory
school contests, and the errors, except
those perpetrated by tho Bennington
students in the seventh inning, were
not particularly costly. Each team
secured 18 hits but Rutland led in the
total number of bases.
Neither of the pitchers appeared to
have much speed but their control was
good and bases on balls were few.
The Bennington Infield was outclassed
both in accuracy and speed but the
team made a good showing considering
the fact that the majority of tho play
ers have had only one season's ex
perience and some are taking part in
their first season. '
Rutland led after the first Inning,
but there was an interesting period in
the sixth when Bennington tallied
three times and came within one of
evening the score. In the seventh,
however, Rutland landed on Parsons
for five singles and a double and ian
away with the game. The score:

Prosperous Condition.

it was hoped the town would replace,

feel that, if it puts in the fence, the
town should do the wall.
Two entertainments were given dur
ing the year to raise money for the
fence and also if possible to plant
trees in the vacant lot near the rail
road station.
' The first of these, a tea at the homo
of! Mrs.; George F. Graves in August,
wasv not. only a financial success, but
a klelightful social event. In Novem

tlements near the border Glenn
Springs, Boquillas and Deemers
took place Friday night and Saturday
morning, but news of it did not reach
El Paso until yesterday.
Within an hour preparations had
been begun for adequate action.
Maj-Gen Frederick Funston ordered
that in all, four troops of cavalry
should proceed to the raided, section
to reinforce small detachments al-
eady on their way to the scene from
'residio, Alpine and other( points.
niese troops got unuer way iasi
lght. It is said at El Paso that if
the exigencies of the case demand
such action they will cross the border
in order to run down and disperse the
bandits.
Practically all the details of ' tho
raid reaching El Paso yesterday came
to Gen Funston from Maj O. B. Meyer
of the 14th cavalry, stationed at Mar
fa. According to Maj, Meyer, tho
bandits, about 75 in number, crossed
the Rio Grande from the Mexican
ide late Friday afternoon at a point
south of Terlingua, Tex., where there
is a guard of about 30 men. From
there they proceeded eastward
through the desolate reaches 'of the
Dig Bend country over an old wagon
road toward Glenn Springs, a small
ranch settlement.
A few miles west of Glenn Springs
an American patrol of eight men
from Troop A of the 14th cavalry,
under command of Sergeant Smith,
was stationed. The bandits began
an attack on the little temporary
shack in which the eight troopers
were quartered before the single sen
tinel could raise an alarm. The time
was about 11 o'clock.
The attackers rushed toward the
shack shouting, ."Villa, Villa!" and
'Vive Carranza!" They were met by
sturdy defense from the half-asleep
Americans, however, and failed in
their evident attempt to make a quick
capture of the patrol guard.
From 11 o'clock that night until
after 2 o'clock in the morning Ser
geant Smith fought the Mexicans
from the shelter of the patrol house.
In that time three of his men, Privates
Colicni Coloe and Rogers, had been
killed and he and all the rest were
wounded. Then the shack caught fire.
It was impossible to stay longer, so
Sergeant Smith ordered a retreat. Two
of . his men were so badly wounded it
was1 necessary to carry them. Smith
ami the other men not only succeeded
ui! removing the; badly wounded, but
they took out the bodies of the three
dead men and carried them to a place
of safety. ;.,!,,
There was a motor truck attached
to the camp. The dead and danger
ously wounded men were loaded into
this and sent north toward Marathon,
a station on the Southern Pacific, 85
miles north, in the hope that medical
aid might be secured for the wounded.
One man loft with the truck. This
left Smith and two others to engage
the bandies. The yretlred to tho low
hills and fought from behind rocks and
mounds of gravel.
While this was going on ranchmen
of the vicinity had heard the shoot
ing and had hurried to the scene. Al
though few in number, they formed
an adequate' reinforcement. With the
badly wounded and deud .disposed, of,.
Seargeant Smith and his meu joined .
in the fighting aguin, and about . 4.
o'clock, as dawn neared, the Mexicans
retreated,
