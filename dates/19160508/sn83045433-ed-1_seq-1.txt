London, May 7.-The Germans have
sized the offensive from. the hands of!
the French and today delivered furious
attacks on the Often-mile front north of
Verdun, winning successes on both sides
of the Meuse,
On the entire fifty-mile fan-shaped
front around the great fortress the crown
prince has opened the most terrific battle
of the campaign. The bombardment has
attained a climax of violence from the
Argonne to far in the Woevre. At the St.
Mihlel salient the Germans are showing
signs of great activity.
The gains registered today are the
greatet won by the Germans in the last
month, and the largest registered in
twenty-four hours since the erst few
lays of battle.
East of Hilt No. 304, the dominating
height west of the Meuse against which
the crown prince is concentrating his en
tire energy in this region, the Germana
today took by storm sections of the
French communicating trenches.
The attack was launched after an artil
lery bombardment continuing two days
with such violence that it changed the
contour of the whole sections of lands.
The German troops swept forward on a
wide front, stretching from Hill No. 301
as far as Deadman Hill.
'he French brought to bear a tre
mendous artillery and machine gun
fire against the advancing ranks, in
flicting heavy losses and stemming the
attack on a great section of the front.
Only to the sector east of hill No. 304
were the Germans able to gain a foot

Simultaneous with the great drive
