WILSON ASKS
FOR FAIRNESS
Declares Charges are In
credible and Proceed
From Hatred.
Washington, May 8.—President
Wilson's letter giving his reasons for
nominating Louis Brandeis for Jus
tice of the supreme court, and urging
his confirmation, was read to the sen
ate Judiciary committee today by
Chairman Culberson, but no vote was
taken as had been expected, and no
time was fixed for the vote.
Charges Incredible.
The president characterized the
ehargee against his nominee ae "in
trinsically incredible to any one who
really knows Mr. Brandeis" and de
clared they "proceeded for the most
part from those who hated Mr. Bran
deis because he had refused to be
serviceable to them in the promotion
of their own selfish interests and
from those whom they had prejudiced
and misled."
Propaganda Unfair.
The president added that "the
propsganda in this matter had been
very extraordinary and very distress
ing to those who love fairness and
value the dignity of the great pro
fessions."

GERARD REPLIES
American Ambassador Says
He is not an Enemy
of Germany.
Berlin, May 7. via London, May 8.
—In an interview in the National
Zeitung, James W. Gerard, the Amer
ican ambassador, is quoted as saying:
"In this crisis as in all previous
crises I attached the greatest value
to removing misunderstandings be
tween Germany and America and did
everything in my power that a con
flict between the two countries might
be avoided. I want no war between
Germany and America. 1 have never
wanted and shall never want one.
"I assure you that the accusation
that I am an enemy of Germany is
totally wrong. I have never done any
thing to justify the charge that
hate German characteristics or Ger
man men."
Against those who have maligned
him, Ambassador Gerard appeals to
leading personages of the German
government who, he declares, the
quoted newspaper interview states,
know that he has done and is doing
everything possible to preserve peace
between Germany and the United
States.
All the morning newspapers, with
the exception of the Tages Zeitung.
reproduce prominently the National
Zeltung's Interview with Ambassador
Gerard.

Washington, May 8.—Secretary Baker stated that the war depart

suit of the Villa bandits still in operation, and that under its terms
General l'tonston tvill take any steps necessary to pursue the band
which Friday night raided the Big Bend country without further in
structions.
MEXICANS COMPltETEIjY orTCEASSED.
Field Headquarters, Near Namlquipa. Mexico, May 8.—The puni
tive expedition under General Pershing has accounted to date for
about 175 Villa bandits slain and more than 800 wounded. Meanwhile
the Americans lost six killed, a rate of almost 20 bandits slain for ev
er)- American life lost, in wounded, the bandits suffered more than'
80 casualties for every American hit by a bullet. While the expedl
tionary forces have lost one officer, the Mexicans have had half a dozen
of their most important leaders killed.
Hie significance of this showing was that it was made against some
of the most desperate fighters in Mexico and men whose reputations
ranked high among military men produced by a few vears of the Mex
ican revolution.
More important than the number of bandits killed haa been their
complete loss of morale, and nowhere will they stand any longer to
fight the Americans. After a few shot* from an advantageous ground,
the bandits run, abandoning their positions before the Americans an
on equal terms, this has been demonstrated in the last two fights with
the bandits.
