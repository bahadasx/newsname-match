dits w ho raided Glenn Springs and Al
pine, Tex., last week, secretary Bak
er said today he had received a report
from General Funston, as to steps tak
en in that direction, but declined to re
veal its contents.
General Fun.ton said that the
forces which arrived at Marathon to
day totalled only about 300 men and
that with stray detachments available
along the border. Col. Frederick W.
Sibley, in command would have less
than 500 men at his disposal. The
general Is anxious to get back to San
Antonio and will hurry there just as
soon as the conference here is ended.
Asked today if he intended sending
troops into the Bis Kend district, ad
ditional to those already on their way,
General Funston replied:
I have not any to send."

of the signal force.

General Funston, will, shortly re

Authorities can se no way to check
the raids until the guard is strength

Baker stat " today- that the war de
partment considers the agreement un
der which the army began pursuit of
Villa bandits still in operation and that
under the terms, General Funston will
take any steps necessary to pursue the
band which Friday night raided the
Rig Bend country, without further in
structions. Hurried dispatch of additional
troops to the raided district and pos
sibly another punitive expedition were
In prospect.
Army officers considered it possible
though not entirely probable that
Villa might have partienpated in the
raid.
Indications that more than 500 out
laws might be hiding in the hills south
of the border were suggested in a mes
sage from General Funston.

New York, May 8. The report that
the Fabre line steamship Venezia was
attacked and chased by two German
commerce raiders and submarines in
midsea on May 1. was denied today by
Captain Bonifacio, the ship master, in
making his report to the Kabre line
office, and to Captain (Jaunt. British
naval attache.
Captain Oaunt in reporting to the
British admiralty stated his belief that
the two ships sighted were either
Krench or British converted cruisers
guarding the steamship lane and were
evidently engaged in target practice,
employing the tenders in observing
and placing the target. .
"Neither of the steamers attempted I
to chase me although I altered my j
course, as I was suspicious of the ves- i
sels and several flashes of gunfire j
which, however, was at targets not '
visible to me or my officers." said !

STOCKMEN WILL

Kansas Investigation of Condi
tions in This State.
Fluctuations of Prices Cause
of Immediate Action.
GIVE EVIDENCE TO WASHINGTON
Department of Justice Will Re
ceive Result of Probe.
No Charge of Violations and
Manipulations Mercer.
Kansas stockmen will conduct a
probe of market conditions. That was
the announcement in Topeka today by
J. H. Mercer, state livestock sanitary
commissioner. The announcement
was made when Mercer returned from
a trip to Chicago, where he attended
a meeting of members of a special
committee appointed by the Kansas
Stockmen's association to Investigate
fluctuations of prices on the open mar
ket. The Chicago meeting devoted much
of its time to the preparation of a
program for gathering evidence. A
number of other meetings will be held
this summer, and a second conference
of the committee will be held in Gar
den City late this month when the
commitee meets in conjunction with
the executive commitee of the state
association. Should evidence of law
violations be gathered it will be turn
ed over to the department of justice.
The department is now investigating
the conditions under terms of a reso
lution recently introduced in congress
by Congressman Dudley Doolittle of
the Fourth Kansas district.
Have Long Complained.
In former years Kansas stock ship
pers have complained most bitterly
concerning market conditions and the
unexpected and unexplained slump in
prices. Usually the stockmen have
met and passed resolutions. That was
as far as the matter went until Con- ,
gressman Doolittle recently brought
the matter before congress. Now Kan- j
sas stock shippers are behind the fight j
and a real effort will be made to get ;
to the source of trouble. j
do not want to charge law viola-tio-ns
or manipulations, nor do I want i
to intimate irregularities in the action j
of the packers on the stock markets," j
said Mercer. "There is one thing cer- j
tain, though. The investigation will j
probably result in something more
than the passage of resolutions. If
there is any real evidence against the
packers, it will be turned over to the
department of justice."
Big Slump Last Fall.
In three days last fall there was a
slump of $1.50 a hundred on cattle on
the open market. No satisfactory ex
planation was made. At this time
market prices are high and a majority
of the stockmen are now said to be
making money. Losses last year, how- i
ever, were heavy.
The committee which will Investi
gate market conditions for the state
association is composed of George
Plumb, Emporia, chairman; J. H. Mer
cer, Topeka. secretary; W. J. Tod, Ma
ple Hill; W. Pv. Stubbs, Lawrence, and
H. M. Stonebraker, Kansas City. A
second meeting of the committee wil'
be held in Garden City late this month
probably May 2 7.

Following an agreement, which It
is understood here has been 'entered
into by the Heim railway and the
county commissioners of Shawnee and
Jefferson counties by which the three
parties are to share equally the cost
of erecting a brfdge over Kaw river
at Grantville, backers of the Kansas
City, Kaw Valley & Western railway
have abandoned their scheme to build
on the south Pide of the river from
Lawrence Engineers for the railway
have already completed plans1 for the
extension of the line on the north pide
of the river to Grantville. From that
point the road will follow the south
side of the stream.
After crossing the Kaw at Grant
ville, seven miles northeast of the city,
the line will be built into Oakland,
where it probably will connect with
the Topeka Street Railway company's
line. No arrangements have been
made so far, however, for the, use of
the street car companys tracks, ac
cording to Howard Patten, superin
tendent of company. Surveyors for
the Heim line are now working out of
Oakland and will continue to lay out
the line to Grantville.
Under the present scheme, the main
line of the K, C. K. V. & W. will not
enter Lawrence. A branch, however,
will take passengers to the city where
a station is now being erected. The
main line already has entered North
Lawrence.
Along Better Grade.
Several reasons are responsible for
the sudden change in plans of the rail
way. The principal factors, however,
are the greater number of towns on
the north side and the more conven
ient grade. From North Lawrence to
Grantville,- the country is practicallv
without a hill and a line can be built
through it at considerably lower cost
than is possible on the south side of
the river.
By building on the north side to
Grantville the line will tafte in Wil

and a number of other small towns. All
of these towns are desirous of having

For years, the county commission

Banks Outside Topeka Pay 3 Per Cent
on Dally Balances.
The plea that Topeka bankers made
to the effect that they could not af
ford to pay more than two per cent
I for the use of city and county funds,
j not long ago," received a hard jolt
.Saturday when the' county commis
sioners, through the county treasurer,
placed on deposit with county banks
the sum of $5,000 and are to receive
three per cent on average daily bal
ances. This fact was not given to To.ek .
bankers from a distant county but the
blow was delivered thorn right here at
home. The money was all placed in
Shawnee county banks, forty thou
sand dollars being placed in two banks
at Russville and fifteen thousand dol
lars in the bank at Silver-Lake.
Xot long ago Topeka bankers united
in lelling city md county officials they
could not pay either city or county
more than two per cent for the use
of city or county money on average
daily balances. This statement was
made in spite of the fact that they pay
the state over three per cent and the
school board three per cent on all
average daily balances. Just how they
reconcile the fact that a state dot Mr
is worth more than one owned by the
city or county, as to interest, the
county commissioners could n,ot figure,
o they began casting about for bet
ter rates for the use of county money,
with the above results.
This means a clear gain of fifty per
cent on daily balances these three
banks may have of county funds
over and above the amount the To
