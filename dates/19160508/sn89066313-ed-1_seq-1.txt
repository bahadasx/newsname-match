CONSOLIDATION VOTE
OPENS A NEW FIELD
Count is 143 to SI in Favor
of Modern School Plan
Around Hallsville.
AFFECTS 7 DISTRICTS
Similar Action Elsewhere in
County Is Beginning to
Be Agitated.
A new period in the history of
schools in Boone Count began Satur
day when seven school districts con
tering around Hallsville decided bj a
vote of I4"i to SI to consolidate into
one school district. This consolidation
will make possible seven good elemen
tary schools ami a high school at
Hallsville
Up to this time there lias been only
a two jears' high school cour in the
Hallsville school, although the total
valuation of the seven districts is
$533,000. No pupil in the district lives
more than two or three miles away.
This community enterprise thus
brings the school within walking dis
tance of the pupils who form rlj
found it necessary to attend bis'h
Sv'hcol at Centralia or Columbia.
The action of these seven districts
ij 1 1 accordance with the Uuford "on
soliiiation law, under which 10)
schools are alreadj- organized TI'c
liicf diflicultj in obtaining more aiich
C'i&olidated schools is, jt is said, tlf
lack of understanding of their purio:e
and organisation. After the election
at Hallsville many who had voted
against the measure expressed them
selves as pleased that the step in ad
vance had been taken.
Agitation for similar action in other
schools in Boone Count is now be
ginning. Ashland, Harrisburg, Roche
port, Sturgeon and Browns are con
sidered as centers for hit r consolidat
ed districts.
