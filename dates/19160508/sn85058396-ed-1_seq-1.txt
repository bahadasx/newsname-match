; Vjiie.jn the recent fighting on tho
-' Vordun front the Germans have
turned an entire system of trenches
i ,on tho northern slope of hill 304, the
r. war office announced today.
( "Western front: The operations
I rwest of the Meuse (Verdun front) dur
f ing recent days have been carried
out principally by brave Pomeranian
i (troops. They were attended by great
difficulties, but, with moderate losses,
wore successful. Notwithstanding the
t tenacious defense and furious counter
1 attacks of the enemy, the Germans
took an entire system of trenches on
the northern slope of hill 30-1. Tho
German lines reached the top of the
iheight. Tho enemy suffered extraor-
dlnarily heavy losses, so that only 40
-unwounded officers and 1,280 soldiers
were captured by us. Attacks by the
enemy on our positions on the west
ern slope of the hill were repulsed
everywhere with heavy loss.
Bitter Fighting East of Meuse.
"East of the Meuse, on t both sides
of Thiaumont farm, here was bitter
fighting. The enemy, along with
other troops, employed negroes in the
fighting east of tho farm. The at
tack broko down with 300 men made
pprlsoners. In tho engagements men
tioned fresh French troops were recog.
nlzed.
In tho Mouse sector the enemy has
employed 51 divisions, including
divisions which were used a second
time after being brought up to full
strength. This means fully twice the

There are about 12,000 men in a di
vision, so that according to the Ger
man statement, the French have em
ployed more than 600,000 men In tho

erally believed that the number of
troops used by the Germans was
much in excess of the 300,000 or so in
dicated in today's official report.

BRIEF NOTE TO
GO TO GERMANY
Will Be No Break While Sub
marine Commanders Obey
Their New Instructions.
United States Stands by De
mands Germany Cannot
Dictate American Nego
tiations With Great
Britain.
Washington, May 8. The American
reply to Germany's submarine note
was sent to Berlin today, and will be
Kiven out for piiblicatlon later today.
It Is officially described as being
brief.
Secretary Lansing announced that
the note was about 200 words in
length and would he given out today
for publication in tomorrow's morn
ing papers. He declined to discuss
it.
Tho understanding In official circles
Is that the note tells Germany that
diplomatic relations will not be brok
en whllo the new orders to submarine
commanders are respected hut reiter
ates that any negotiations between
Germany and the United States can
not be conditioned on negotiations be
tween the United States and Great
Britain.
Washington, May 8. A note to Gor
many has practically been completed
and probably will go forward to Ber
lin today. It will be made public soon
afterward. It is understood It will
be brief, Informing Germany that as
long as the new Instructions to sub
marine commanders are observed, dip
lomatic relations will be continued,
but that the United States cannot al
low Germany to dictate Its negotia
tions with Great Britain.
The president worked on the pro
posed communication early today, fol
lowing his conference with Secretary
Lansing last nhrht.
While the German noto has averted,
for the present at least, a break in
diplomatic relations, it was said to
day that the president was not satis
fied with the apparent conditions at
tached by Germany The United
States stands by Its demand that Ger
many ceaBe hor attacks on vessels in
violation of international law, regard
less of negotiations which may be car
ried on with Great Britain over the
food blockade.
GERMANS MAKING
A NEW ATTACK
After Fighting Seventy-seven
Days at Verdun New and
Formidable Army Is
Brought Up.
GREAT BATTLE RAGING
French Reinforce Weak Line
and Place Best Trained Corps
to Withstand Tremendous
Attack.
Paris, May S, 8 -45 a. m. After seventy-seven
days of battle the Germans
are making a new attack before Ver
dun with another formidable army
Fighting almost equal in violence to
that of the beginning of March is m
progress on both banks of the Meuse
The principal effort of the Germans
is beinp: directed against Dead Man's
hill Following1 the Napoleonic policy
of attempting to turn what cannot be
carried by frontal attack, tho Germans
with a whole army corps, made the
assault by way of the ravine between
Hill 304 and Dead Man's hill, seeking
to crush In the French line along a
front of one and one half miles. The
ground there is favorable for attack
and the French commander, aware of
the weakness of the position placed
one of his best trained army corps
at that place This corps disposed or
the initial attack without ceding any
important ground but the battle is
still raging and according to the latest
advices, tho result will not bo known
until some time today.
Four Attacks By Prussians.
East of the Meuse the Germans de
livered four attacks on a front ot 2,
000 yards each advance being made by
a -different Prussian regiment: ' The
fighting there Is as fiorce as on the
other side of the river and as incon
clusive. General Nlvelle, whose promotion to
the command at Verdun put him in
charge at such a critical time, is a
man of sixty and is one of the discov
eries of the war. At the outbreak of
hostilities he was in command of the
Fifth regiment of artillery. Gen. Jof
fre soon singled him out fora leading
role. He was promoted to be general
of brigade on Oct. 29, 1914, and short
ly afterwards was placed In command
of the Sixty-first infantry division. On
Dec. 23, 1916, he received his three
stars and at the same time was ap
pointed commander of the Third army
corps.

UNCERTAIN AS TO TAX
LEVY FOR SCHOOL
PURPOSES
County Clerk Harry Hales com
municated to the county board of com
missioners that there Is a seeming dis
crepancy in the statutory provisions
respecting tax levy for Bchool pur
poses. He states that in one provision
of the statutes a levy of 3.5 mills may
be made for schools in cities of the
first and Bocond class, and that there
is another provision fixing the limit
at 10 mills.
Mr. Hales suggests that the county
attorney be roquired to submit an
opinion as to which of the two provls
Ions shall be followed, aB he Is unable
to determine. The clerk states that
to raise ?160,000 for the Ogdon
schoolB, as asked for by the city board
of education, a lovy of 5 mills would
be necessary.
The county commissioners have tak
en the matter under advisement and
an effort will bo made to solve the

New American Expedition Crosses I
Border in Pursuit of Mexican Raiders I
BANDITS FLEE
INTO INTERIOR
Mexicans Who Raided Glenn
Springs and Boquillas Now
Many Miles From Scene.
TROOPS IN PURSUIT
Raiders Have Three-day Start
Only Relentless Chase
Will Enable Americans
to Overtake Them.
Alpine, Texas, May S Fleeing
through the wild mesaa of northern
Coahuila, tho seventy or more bandits
that raided the American settlement
of Glenn Springs and Boquillas, last
Friday, killing threo cavalrymen, and
a nine-year-old boy, are believed to be
heading into the Interior today, many
miles from the scene of their depreda
tions. A posse from Marathon and a de
tachment of twenty-three troopers of
tho Fourteenth cavalry are said to
have followed the trail of tho Mexi
cans In Coahuila, while other reports
have it that the Americans have not
forded the Rio Grande, 95 miles from
here, but aro waiting at tho river for
reinforcemonts. Captain Caspar Cole
is hurrying to Boquillas to take com
mand, whllo two companies of the
Fourteenth cavalry and a machine
gun company are expected here, or at
Marathon this afternoon, wbon they
will head southward to tho Big Bend
country.
It is not known here whether the
new troops contemplate a long pursuit
of the bandits Into Mexico or will be
placed as an additional guard along
tho border.
Many Bandits Operating.
"Reports here say that there are
many bandits operating between Bo
quillas and Presidio, just south of the
Rio Grande
It is about a three-days march from
eithor Marathon or Alpine to the Rio
Grande, and as the bandits already
have a three-days start, only a relent
less pursuit will bring the Americans
into contact with their quarry.
Private Roscoe Tyree Missing.
Nothing has been heard of Private
Roscoe Tyree, who was last seen as
he ran from the adobe house where
he and his eight companions for three
long hours fought against the Mexi
cans and then fled because the roof
of the house was sot aflarao by fire
balls. Private Croskem, who was in tho
fight, thinks that Tyree was wounded
and wandered off In the hills, where
he died. Others believe that Tyree
was captured and carried off a prison
er by the bandits and probably killed
later.
Storekeeper's Throat Cut.
Unconfirmed information says that
J. Deemer, the storekeeper at Boquil
las, has been found dead on the Mex
ican side, with his throat cut. His
clerk, named Compton, is known to
have been a captive of tho bandits.
He Is thought to have suffered the
fate of Deemer.
There were only a few Americans In
Glenn Sprlpgs and at Boquillas at tho
time of tho raid and tho bandits ap
parently made no effort to locate
them. They escaped Into the lillls
when the shooting started.
Several women aro known to bo liv
ing on tho scattered ranches in the
Big Bend country, but there is noth
ing to Indicate that they have been
molested. The Mexican employes of
the Ellis Wax factory In Glenn Springs
vere not molested.
Bodies to Be Sent Home.
The bodies of the three soldiers
killed in the Glenn Springs raid, Wil
liam Cohen, Stephen J. Coloo, and
Hudson Rogers, will bo sent to their
homes today. The body of the Comp
ton boy has been taken to Marathon.
A truck driver, Champ Woods, yester
day reported missing, is safe.
Mrs, W. K. Ellis and her husband,
whose wax Tactory was dostroyod by
the Mexicans, had narrow escapeB.
Mro. Ellis was tho only woman In
Glenn Springs when the bandits
swooped down upon tho little settle
ment near midnight. Jn the flickering
lights of tho burning buildings, she
and her huBband Htolc out of thoir
house and fled in Bafety to tho hills,
where they wandered " around until
morning.
Mrs. Elite Tells Story.
Telling her frieuds of hor experi
ences In Marathon, where she is rest
Ing today, Mrs. Ellis said;
"A fusillade of shots roused by hus- :
band and myself. Peering out of the ;
windows, we saw the forms of men i
moving. In the direction of the soldiers'
little camp.
I'The flashoB ot their rifles wore like 1
lightning streaks against the darkness I
and we knew there muBt be a number i
of -Mexicans attacking the place. Mr. l
Ellis told mo not to strike a match,
or make any light for fear of attract- J
23toBH5Ba9fl3fii
ing the attention of the bandit's.
"In the dark we hunted for our
clothes and quickly dressed. The ban
dits were now firing rapidly at the
adobe house where, I later learned,
the soldiers of troop A made their
stand.
Flee to the Hills.
"We could hear the shouts of the
Mexicans and saw a party of them
moving toward our bungalow. We
slipped out of the back door and hug
ging every shadow as we went, for
fear of being shot, made our way into
the hills.
. "There we hid behind boulders and
rocks and dawn found us wandering In
the mesquite andtlesert growth, three
miles from Glenn Springs. Heaven
knows how we got so far in the dark
ness. I don't.
"I don't know whose ranch it was,
but I was given a burro and rode on
it four miles to John Rice's ranch.
"After the raid, we returned to our
home in Glenn Springs, having heard
that the Mexicans had left.
Silverware Not Stolen.
The Interior of the house was
thrown Into disorder and clothes were
missing, but strangely enough, silver
ware, thrown about, was not stolen.
"My husband has been popular with
the Mexicans employed In his wax
factory, and that is probably the rea
son why the Mexicans did not burn
our home. I am not afraid to go back
and hope to do so when thero Is suf
ficient military protection."

Austin, Texas, May 8. The state ranger force is to be H
increased by fifty additional men at once, and a call may be H
issued for 1 00 additional rangers for service on the border, ac- H
cording to an official statement issued today by Governor 'jl
Ferguson. H
Washington, May S. A new Ameri
can expedition, may already be across
the Mexican border In pursuit of the
bandits who raided Glenn Springs and
Alpine, Texas, last week. Secretary
Baker said today he had received a
report from General Funaton as to
steps taken in that direction, but de
clined to reveal its contents. He said
,GeneraI Funston's original orders
stood, however, and they gave him au
, thority to cross whenever the need
arose.
No additional report of the raid had
reached the department at the time.
On the basis , of consular dispatches
yesterday, however, Secretary Jans
Jng has forwarded a report to the
Mexican de facto government calling
attention to the latest bandit activi
ties along the border. State depart'
ment officials said it was assumed
that prompt pursuit of tho raiders al
ready had been ordered by General
Obregon or his subordinates.
May Plan Co-operation.
It was believed posslblo that some
method of direct co-operation for the
extermination qv capture of the Glenn
Springs raiders might result from the
conference today between Generals
Scott and Obregon at El Pago. Tho
war department haB heard Informally
' that General Carranza approved the
Scott-Obregon plan with only minor
exceptions. It was hoped here the
whole matter would be disposed of to
day by tho conferees.
There was no indication at the de
partment that steps were in contemp
lation to increase the border forces
because' of the Glenn Springs incident.
Secretary Baker would not say wheth
er General Funston had made new
'recommendations on this subject. It
Is known that the calling out of a por
'tion of the National Guard to aid in
'the border patrol Is not now under
consideration.
Army Officers Feared Trouble.
Army officers have feared some
such occurrence ,ns that at Glenn
! Springs since it became necessary to
break up tho border guard into squad
paptrols. It is understood that com
pany commanders In several In
stances have urged that their com
mands be held together for protec
tion. j
The state department today re
ceived a report of the Glenn Springs
raid agreeing with those received from
General Funston and with press dispatches.
Telegrams Rushed to Governor.
El Paso, Texas, May 8. Telegrams
and letters from all along the Texas
border were being forwarded today to
Governor Ferguson urging that, he
use tho state militia for border pro
tection. Generals Scott indicated this morn
ing that the next move in the neg(
tlations must come from the Mexi
cans. , ,
When asked if he would lake any
steps toward arranging the next con
feience, the general Baid:
"Not one stop."
Obregon Must Make Move.
He added that the request for tho
meeting will have to be made by Gen
eral Obregon. '
From information received here to
day, it is thought tho bandits in the
Big Bend may have been under the
inn,i-aiitn nP T?nsallf Hernandez, a
Villa chief, who has been operating in
the vicinity of Santa Rosalia, about
150 miles south of Boquilla, Mexico.
Tho trull to Boquilla from Santa Ros
alie is an open one and would bo easy
for the Mexican horsemen to ride.
Obregon Calls Conference.
General Obregon announced at 9:30
o'clock, that tho next conference with
Generals Scott and Funston would bo
held about noon. General Gavlra,
Carranza commander in Juarez, said
today that the Mexicans take tho view
that the Big Bend raid was Instigated
by interventionists, and that no groat
importance was attached to it for that
reason. it ..
Marathon, on tho Southern Pacific
railway, almost 100 miles north of tho
international line, will be tho base of
operations, General Funston an
lounced today. From there a field
., - --.ii.m- Jr---iw"ifl?
telegraph line will he run to the ad ,-H
vanced base. IH
Asked today if he intended, sending H
troops into the Big Bend district ad- H
ditlpnal to those already on their way, H
General Funston said: H
"I have none to send." H
Qen. Funston Anxious. H
General Funston said today it , H
"would not be proper" for him to dis- . M
close whether or no an expeditionary . H
force was going into Coahuila in pur- H
suit of the Mexican bandits. He did H
not deny that there would be such a H
movement. He said, however, he be- H
Moved that troops had "not yet" cross- '
ed the border. ;M
Obregon Falls to Appear. 'M
At noon there was no sign of a con- 'H
ference. General Obregon remained M
in his private car at Juarez. It was :
reported on the Mexican side that the ' M
minister of war was preparing to start IH
south at six o'clock this evening. H
Troops Ordered Forward. H
Two companies of the 19th infan- JM
try in tho Muskriver school at Fort -
Sill, Okla,, havo been ordered to Fort H
Clark, Texas, to take the place of the
14th cavalry troops which were sent H
to the Big Bend districts. M
More Troops Neened. H
San Antonio, May 8. Army officers M
here are hopeful that the Glenn H
Springs affair will serve to arouse the 'M
war department to the pressing need H
of additional troops for border patrol l
duty. General Funston asked for more M
troops at the time he was forced to -H
take 2,500 men from the border to H
strengthen General Pershing's army H
in Mexico, but the request was not H
granted. H
The nine soldiers attacked at Glenn H
Springs belonged to a regiment, the H
Fourteenth cavalry, that has been at- H
tempting to patrol a stretch of nearly H
400 miles of the wildest country along H
tho entire Mexican border. Troops and H
detachments of the regiment are H
spread out from Laredo, almost to H
Sierra Blanca. The latter place Is only H
eighty miles from El Paso. Because H
of the immense territory to be cov- H
ered, it was necessary to divide tho H
regiment Into many small detach- H
ments. H
