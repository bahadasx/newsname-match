Fighting, After 77 Days, Al
most Equals violence of
Early Engagements.
Paris, France, May S. Fighting of
great violence continued Sunday night
on the Verdun front Furious German
attacks near Hill 301 were broken by
the French, the war office announced
today. v
After 77 davs of battle the Germans
are making a new attack before Verdun
with another formidable army. Fight
ing almost equal in violence' to that
of the beginning of March Is in progress
on both banks of the Meuse.
The losses of the Germans are de
scribed as extremely heavy The
I rench attacked cast of Hill 301 and
drove the Germans from a communi
cating trench which they ' penetrated
Sunday.
East of the Meuse, in a series of
night engagements, the Germans Were
driven irom a irencn soutn 01 nauu
reniont, which they occupied today
and SO men, including officers, were
captured.
The principal effort of the Germans
is being directed against Dead Man's
Hill. Following the Napoleonic policy
of attempting to turn what cannot be
carried by frontal attacks, the Germans,
with a whole army corps made the as
sault by way of the ravine between
Hill No. 304 and Dead Man's Hill, seek
ing to crush in the French line along a
front of one and one-half miles. The
ground there is favorable for attack
and the French commander, aware of
the weakness of the position, placed one
of his best trained army corps at that
place. This corps disposed of the ini
tial attack without ceding any import
ant ground but the battle is still raging
and, according to the latest advices,
the result will not be known until some
time today.

Washington, D. C. May 8 President
Wilson's letter, giving his reasons for
nominating Louis D. Brandeis for the
supreme court and urging his confirma
tion, was read to the senate Judiciary
committee today by chairman Culber
! 'on. but no vote wast taken,' as hard
been expected, and no time .-was fixed
for one.
President Wilson characterised the
charges against his nominee as "In
trinsically incredible to anyone who
really knows Mr. Brandeis." and de-
clared they ' proceeded for the most
I part from those who hatarl Mr Ttmndeifl
because he had refused to be service
able to them In promotion of their own
selfish interests, and from those whom
they had prejudiced and misled."
The president added that the propa
ganda in this matter has been verr
extraordinary and very- distressing to
those who love fairness and value the
dignity of the great professions."
Intended llrnndrin for Cabinet.
The president wrote that he believed
the reports of the subcommittee which
investigated the Brandeis nomination
had already made it plain that the
charges were unfounded He said he
had serlouslv considered appointing
Mr. Brandeis to ins cabinet three years
ago and at that time examined his
qualifications verv thoroughly. He
aded that he had tested Mr. Brandeis
by seeking his advice on perplexing
public questions and had dealt with
him in matters "where nice questions
of honor and fall -lay. as well aa
large questions of justice and the pub
lic benefit were Involved. '
The president closed ty eaylng that
