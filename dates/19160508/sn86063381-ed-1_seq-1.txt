LIVELY BIDDING
IS EXPECTED AT
GOVERNMENTSALE
Lands Being Sold at Court House
Under the Volstead Act Many
Buyers Here.
SEVERAL AFTER SAME
TRACTS: KEEN COMPETITION
Sale Conducted by J. L. George,
County Auditor Delinquent
Tax Lands Sold.
With a large number of pur
chasers in attendance, so many that
there will not be enough land to go
round, the tax judgment sale of gov
ernment land was started at the court
house this afternoon at two o'clock.
The sale, which is under the direc
tion of J. L. George, county auditor,
will probably continue for several
days.
This morning was taken up by the
disposing of privately owned lands
on which taxes are delinquent.
Represent Clients.
A large number of land buyers are
in the city representing clients to
purchase land for them atthe gov
ernment sale. Several of the
purchasers are anxious to secure the
same tracts and spirited bidding will
result. Considerable excess of the as
sessments is believed certain.
Methods Differ.
For privately owned lands the
method is to bid downwards on the
interest demanded, when there is
competition with the idea that the
purchaser will receive his money back
in case the land is redeemed, with'in
terest at the rate he bids. The legal
rate in case of no competition is 12
per cent.
For government land, the method
differs, from the fact that the pur
chaser buys taxes for the purpose of
homesteading, and would therefore
become the owner himself, and any
interest paid by him would come back
to him when he redeemed. Besides,
under the provisions of the "Vol
stead Act" competition is provided for
and bids to any amount above the
delinquent tax or interest for which
the land is sold, may be made, the tax
certificate going to the highest bid
der, and any excess being paid to the
government before patent shall be
issued.
Liens for Year.
The delinuent taxes for which gov
ernment land is sold consists of the
delinuent interest on drainage liens
for one year. The interest is payable
yearly and must be paid before June
1 to save penalty and interest. The
interest for 1915 which is now due,
must be paid by purchasers before
patent will be issued.
