Columbus, N. M.. May B.—Details of
:he raid upon Glenn Springs, Texas,
transmitted to American detachments
along General John J. Pershing's line
of communication, stirred them to a
new activity, according to reports here
to-day.
In Columbus military officers mani
fested much uncertainty as to the re
sults of the foray and pointed out that
It materially complicates the border
situation. It seems generally under
stood that should it lie deemed neces
sary In pursuit of tli" raiders to dis
patch a second expeditionary column,
some of the 1,000 nivn on station here
and troops encamped along the upper
end of the line of communication -vil 1

Townspeople in Columbus and in
neighboring towns alone the bonier
were aroused by the reports and mani
fested a greater unrest than at any
lime since the raid here two months
igo to-morrow.

Alphine. Texas, May 8. Fleeing
through the wild mesas of Northern
• 'oahuila, the seventy or more ban
dits that raided the American settle
ment of Glenn Springs and Roquillas
last Friday, killing three cavalrymen
and a 9-year-old hoy, are believed to
be heading into the interior to-day,
many miles from the scene of their
depredation.
Many Bandits al l.argc
V A posse from Marathon and a de
tachment of 23 troopers of the Four
teenth cavalry are said to have fol
lowed the trail of the Mexicans into
Coahuila, while other reports have it
that The ATiieitranH are awaiting at
the Rio Grande for reinforcements.
Captain Caspar Cole is hurrying to
Roquillas to take command. Two com
panies of the Fourteenth cavalry and
a machine gun company are expected
here or at Marathon this afternoon.
It is ahout a three days' march
front either Marathon or Alpine to the
Rio Grande and as the Ivtndits already
have a three days' start, only a re
lentless pursuit will bring the Amer
icans into contact with their quarry.
Private Still Missing
Nothing has been heard of Private
Roscoe Tyree, who was last seen as
he ran from the adobe house, where
he and his eight companions for three
hours fought the Mexicans and then
fled because the roof of the house was
set aflame by fire balls.
Private Croskem things Tyree was
wounded and wandered off in the
hills where lie died. Others believe
that Tyree was captured.
Cut Throat of Captive
Unconfirmed information says that
J. Deemer, the storekeeper at Roquil

ican side, with his throat cut. His
clerk, named Compton, is known to
have been a captive of the bandits.
The Americans fled to the hills
when the shooting began.

were only partly successful to-day.
Four thousand of the 4,.100 employed

GIVES NEW FACES
TO WOUNDED MEN
Sculptor, Son of Former Har
risburger, Docs Re
markable Work
In the New York Sun yesterday a
story was printed from London re
garding the remarkable work of Lieu
tenant Derwent "Wood, a sculptor well
known in the United States.
Before the outbreak of the Euro
pean war Wood was commissioned liy
Lady Paget and the Duchess of Marl
borough on behalf of the American
women in England to execute the
statue of William Pitt which, as soon
as circumstances make the thing
more suitable, will be presented by
them to their native land in com
memoration of the hundred years of
peace between England and America.
Lieut. Wood has discovered how to
give new faces to men who have lost
theirs in the war. He can make new
eyes, cheeks, foreheads, chins, in fact,
he is making thpm daily.
The restoration of the disfigured
faces is little short of marvelous. His
"masks," as he calls them, consist of
plates of thin copper, slH'ered and
then painted to match the hue of the
patient's skin. They are light to
wear, they fit like gloves and the men
declare that they give no discomfort
whatever. Yes, they are intended to
be removed at night exactly like a
set of false teeth, and they are easily
cleaned with a little potato juice.
Most of them can be kept in place by
means of "ether'gum" such as actors
use.
Father a Harrlsbuifspr
Lieutenant Wood enlisted in the
Royal Army Medical Corps at the be
ginning of the war. He was not
available for active service. His fath
er, Alpheus Baylies Wood, who died
in England in 1907, where he had
lived for many years, was born in
Harrisburg an(i was a descendant of
two distinguished officers of the
American Revolution. Col. H. Baylies,
aide-de-camp on General Washing
ton's staff, and Capt.' William Rice,
of the Continental line. His nieces
residing here are Mrs. William C.
Pfouts, Mrs. John A. Westbrook and
Mrs. George W. Mindel.
Lieut. Wood declared that the
American-made artificial limbs were
by far the best in the world and spoke
admiringly of the work that is being
done at Roehampton by Americans in
the way of equipping armless and
legless soldiers.
Aged Woman Attacked

Hearing a woman's screams
shortly after 10 o'clock last night

aged lady who said that she had just
been attacked by three colored men
who robbed her of her pocketbook.
The woman was extremely nervous,
and said that she lived in North Fifth
street. She forgot to give her name
and city police officials say they knew
nothing of the holdup.

FURIOUS DRIVE
OF GERMANS IS

Lost' Part of Terrritory Won at
Outset of Renewed At

OTHER FRONTS QUIET
Situations Unchanged in East
and Along Austro-
Italian Lines
The Germans are continuing the !
furious offensive at Verdun which
grained them important ground both
east and west of the Meuse yesterday.
They made no further advances dur
ing their attacks of last night, how
ever, Paris declares, and in fact lost i
part of the territory won at the outset :
of their renewed drive in force on the \
defenses of the fortress.
The principal German gain Sunday
was northeast of Verdun, where a foot
ing was gained In the French first line
on a front of SOO meters between Hau
dromont wood and Fort Douaumont.
During Sunday night French attacks
drove the crown prince's forces from
one of the occupied trenches south of
Haudromont. Near Hill 304, north
west of the fortress, the Germans were
ousted from a communication trench
occupied during yesterday's drive.
There is a lull in the fighting on the
eastern front, according to Vienna,
which announces the situation is un
changed there. Likewise there is a
comparative quiet on the Austro-
Italian front, with no advances by
either of the opposing armies re
ported.

RING CEREMONY
TO BE CHANGED
IN NEW RITUAL
Methodists Will Eliminate
"With All My Worldly Goods,
I Thee Endow"
iTO THROW "DEVIL" OUT
"Sin" Will Be Substituted in
Certain Passages; Modify
Burial Service
Saratoga Springs, N. Y„ May 8, —A
service for the burial of children and
their reception into the church is pro
posed in a revised ritual of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church which was sub
mitted to-day for action by the Gen
eral Conference, in session here. Pre
i viously only a ceremony for adults has
i existed.
The report was offered by a special i
committee appointed in 1912 and is
the third proposal recently made for a
change In the form of service pro
vided by John Wesley when ha insti
tuted the church in 1739. The argu
ment was advanced during discussion
to-day that a modification of the word
ins is necessary to consistency of usage
and greater clearness and brevity. Op
position was heard on the ground that,
the language; of the present ritual had
been made sacred by continued use.
"Sin" for '-Devil"
The new form suggested provides
that the service for the baptism of in
fants and for ordination shall be
greatly shortened. The burial service
would be modified by the insertion of
additional scriptural selections giving
fuller expressions of the Christian
hope as found in the New Testament.
In the marriage ceremony It Is pro
vided that when the ring is used the
words "and with all my worldly goods
I thee endow" shall be omitted, for
the reason, the committee reported,
that the ceremony itself implies com
mon ownership of property.
It is also proposed that the word
"devil" shall be stri'-kon from passages
where it occurs and thai the word
"sin" shall be substituted. The phrase
"the trumpet shall sound and the dead
be raised" would be eliminated, on
the ground that it means the resur
rection of the spirit and not of the
body. The same reason is advanced
for substituting in the burial service
the Twenty-third Psalm for the Thirty
ninth Psalm.
The committee reported that desire
not to lengthen the ritual led to the
rejection of proposals for. services for
special purposes.
