AFTER SEVENTY-SEV J 1AYS'
BATTLE, GERMANS R ' AT
TACK ON VERDUN.
LOST TREIR
Paris -Reports Today Say That Ger
mans Were Driven Out of Some of
the Five Hundred Yards of Trench,
es Which They Captured.
London, May 8. After seventy
seven, days' battle, the Germans are
making renewed formidable attacks
about Verdun almost equaling in vio
lence the first engagements of the
long battle.
The Germans, who captured five
hundred yards of French trenches
Sunday near Douaumont, were driven
out of some of them and failed to
advance further last night, says a
Paris report today.
Sunday's gains were made by the
Teutons at heavy cost, and except
near Hill 304. The entire attack,
which was thrown against the sector
between Hill 304 and Le Mort Homme
was repulsed with serious losses to
the Germans and a similar fate be
fell the forces attacking In the north
west, except near Haudremont wood.
The other fronts are comparatively
quiet again.
REGISTER IF
YOU EXPECT TO
DAY DRAWS NEAR WHEN THE
BOOKS WILL BE CLOSED, AND
MANY HAVE FAILED TO GET
THEIR NAMES ENROLLED.
Wednesday night at midnight the
registration books of the county will
close and all who fail to register be
fore that time will 'be denied the bal
lot both in the primary and In the
general election.
The registers of the county have
done their best to get the voters out
and enroll them, but aside from the
socialists and republicans it seems
that there Is a vast indifference up
on the part of the members of the
dominant party whether they register
or not.
This fact they will regret this fall if
they fail to register and attempt to
vote in the election there will be not
only prosecutions but contested elec
tions following.
Many of the candidates have inter
ested themselves in this matter and
are working with the delinquent ones
to get their names on the register. Un
less this is done, the democrats of
Carter County are going to bump into
the surprise of their lives this fall,
according to reports of some of -the
leading democrats who are working
with might and main to get the voters
to comply with the law before it is too
late, and if the other two parties grab
off a major portion of the offices, the
democrats of the county will have only
themselves to blame.
The registers of the city precincts
especially are doing all In their power
to get the voters registered, but the
Indifference upon the part of so many
of them, they fear, will prove fatal
when the votes are counted this fall.

ACTING IIOR
STOPPED BALE
GAME SUNDAY
CITY OFFICIALS PREVENT YES
TERDAY'S GAME AND SAY THAT
THERE WILL BE NO MORE SUN
DAY BALL IF THEY CAN STOP IT
There was a bunch of sore baseball
fans in the city yesterday when it was
'announced that acting Mayor Lasher
' had issued a warning that any attempt
to p!ay ball in Ardinore on Sundays
while he was serving in such capacity,
would be followed by arrest of all par
ties concerned.
When the southern circuit was form
ed by Mayor Mullen who is now out
of the city, it was understood that
there would be no objection to Sunday
ball If it was conducted in a decorous
manner, and Sunday games have been
played here. But it seems that the
acting mayor and the city commission
ers decided to put the lid on tight.
Just what Mayor Mullen will say to
this when he returns, Is speculative,
It Is a well known fact that without
Sunday ball the league cannot survive
and the sport-loving people who see
no harm in a game of ball on Sunday
will be denied the pleasure. For sev
eral years Ardmore has had an ordi
nance against Sunday baseball, but it
was suspended for a time. Whatever
Mayor Mullen may think about the
matter when he returns, he will ibe
unable to do anything unless the ordi
nance lsr epealed by the board of city
commissioners.
The games scheduled for this city
will be played Tuesday and Wednes
day. The Ardmore High School Orches
tra, under the able direction of Sol
Lowenstein, took first honors at Nor
man Friday over all other entries.
Five schools had entered their or
chestras, but when the time for the
contest arrived only one was found
to meet the Ardmore contingent,
that of Ponca City. Critics in the
audience asserted that the Ardmore
orchestra would do credit to the Uni
versity itself.
Prof. Homburg. dean of music at
the University, was amazed at the
playing of the orchestra, and stated
that it was indeed a revelation to
see and hear the Ardmore High
school orchestra perform.
At Durant on April 13, the High
School Orchestra competed with Me
Alester and Atoka, and came away
with the honors, a handsome silver
cup.
Eighteen members attended. Sev
eral others were unable to go, on
account of other matters. Superin

Indian Scouts with American Troops
Participate in Battle for First Time
and Rode at Head of Cavalry with
Their Shrieking Warwhoops.
Field Headquarters near Namiqulpa
(via wireless), May 8. General Per
shing's expedition to date has ac
counted for one hundred and twenty
five Vil'.istas dead and nearly three
hundred wounded.
The Americans lost six killed and
about ten wounded by bullets.
The significance of this showing Is
in the fact that the Americans were
pursuing some of the most desperate
fighters in Mexico.
The details of the raid on Glenn
Springs have stirred the expedition
ary detachments to renewed activity.
Apache Indians in Fight.
Namiqulpa. May 8. Twenty .war
mad Apaches, scouts of the expedi
tionary force, participated prominent
ly in the recent OJoazules battle.
Shrieking their war whoops they rode
at the head of the cavalry, demon
strating their pistol marksmanship by
killing a goodly number of the fifty
five Mexican victims.
This was the first time the Indians
have been engaged In the fighting.
tendent Richards- stated that he was
more than pleased with the work of
the orchestra, and was unstinted In
his praise of Mr. Lowenstein, to
whose efforts the success attained
by the orchestra is due. Mr. Lowen
stein is gradually adding to his in
strumentation, and before another
year hopes to add materially to the
effectiveness of the orchestra. The
orchestra lias created favorable com
ment wherever it has been heard,
and the citizens of Ardmore are justly
proud of It.
The trophy presented by the Stale
University was a beautiful shield, ap
propriately engraved, and bearing
the seal of the state, which Is added
to the other trophies at the High
school auditorium.
Following are some of the standard
numbers played and perfected by the
orchestra in the past year's work:

Washington, D. C. May 8. The note

LARGE CONGREGATIONS ATTEND!
EVERY SERVICE AND MUCH
GOOD WORK IS BEING ACCOM
PLISHED BY EVANGELIST.
After meeting unusual interruption.
the great revival at the Williams
tabernacle has at last swollen to high
tide. To attempt a report of four
services in one brief article is like
trying to crowd a tornado into a
tin whistle.
Saturday evening was Booster choir
evening. Fully ')) girls, after sing
ing on the streets in the afternoon,
paraded the streets in their May day
cost nines in the evening and rendered
a program at the tabernacle by far
the finest of the entire series. They
thrilled everyone with delight. The
girls have caught the spirit of reli
gious enthusiasm. If now the boys
can be given equal attention, we may
hope not only for a bigger but a bet
ter Ardmore.
The evangelist's appeal, based on
llosea, chapter II, was addressed
to wanderers and backsliders. He
stressed the truth that many fall by
their own Iniquity. They are sin
ners from choice. Everyone must i
give an account of himself to God.
We cannot shirk individual respon
sibility. You will be as the dew to
Israel will warm the heart Into lifo.
He will have mercy. By slandering
God, the devil tries to keep the wan
derer and backslider away from God.
Through his favor they shall grow
