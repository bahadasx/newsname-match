east of the Meuse, where for many
weeks the Oermana havo been attack
ing Pepper heights, four and ono-halt
tnllcs north ot Verdun. , . -Facing
frightful losses by making
.frontal attacks onwcll entrenched
positions, the Oermana are hacking
.'persistently at positions In the ra
vines west of Pepper heights, hoping
,'to drive through to the Meuse and
lores "! retirement from strong works.
Yesterday the Frenoh first line

nearby post to aid the stricken settle

Tbe Mexican raid began at 10
o'clock Friday night. A force estim
ated at between 150 and 300 Mexi
cans crept up on the settlement. They
avoided the American border patrol
by (making a wide detour, forded
rivers and crossed the Intervening
stretch ot territory In the night Nine
men ot the Fourteenth regiment were
in Glenn Springs to protect the settle

post for many miles. A few Mexican
families -made up the remainder of
the population.
When the attack began the Ameri

its doors and windows, and began a
desperate fight against overwhelming
odds. They were routed when tho
Mexicans, despairing of approaching
the beleaguered Americans while
they had any ammunition left, hurled
fireballs upon the thatch roof. Three

No hope Is felt here for Deemer
and Compton. Knowing the) eharae
ter of the raiders, residents of the
district are prepared for the worst.
Tbe Mexican attack was centered
against the American soldiers. When
tbe surviving troopers, most of them
severely wounded, escaped to the
house In the rear of the settlement
the raiders turned their attention to
the village store. At dawn the build
ing was set afire. Compton and
Deemer were tossed into a wagon and
Deemer was ordered to drive.
The first alarm was spread by W.
A. Ellis and his wife, who escaped
on foot and ran to the hills when the
Invaders appeared. After the Mexi

rushed back and found their automo

Driven from their first stand, the
soldiers retreated to the adobe hut,
where the conflict raged tor three

Americans. The troops shot at the
flashes of the Mexican guns.

gotiations with Germany.
It may be stated on the highest
authority that the American message
may be summed up briefly as accept
ance of that part of the German reply
which covers orders to submarine
commanders and rejection of every
thing else.
The answer will eliminate the pos
sibility of a break on any . .episode
which has happened In the past.
Future friendly relations depend on
German adherence to the new orders
Issued to submarine commanders.

ALONG THE MEUSE
Paris, May 8. French troops have
recaptured a large part ot the ground
lost yesterday on both banks ot the
river Meuse. A successful counter
attack last night drove the Germans
from communicating trenches.
The Germans were ousted from
trenches they had seized on Hill 304,
said the communique. A series of
night combats threw the Germans
from the greater part of the 500
yards of threnches occupied between
Haudremont wood and Fort Douau

reason to believe It will be acceptable

The general feeling among admin
istration members was that peace
without the fighting ot another win
ter campaign was possible, and even
probable, but that the - first move
would be a matter ot njonths rather
than weeks. It was hoped that peace
suggestions might take definite form

The Champagne battle has demon

Is decided on, it is recognised that

Washington, lUy 8. Just aa the

President Wilson urged by letter to
act Immediately upon his nomina
tion of Louis D. Brandels as asso
ciate supreme court justice, waa pre
paring to 'ballot today, two senator
object and as a result the action
waa postponed.
Who the objecting senators were ..
members of the committee would not
say. It was understood that Senator
Shields, who attended the Judiciary :
meeting for the first time la months,
was the chief objector.-
President Wilson's letter,' It was
learned, was received with resent
ment When the meeting broke up
friends of Brandels had failed even
in getting an agreement to vote on
his nomination at a definite date.
The president's letter was in reply
to Senator Culberson's note asking
for the "reasons which actuated the
president i the nomination."
The letter was addressed to Cul
berson and said: '
"My dear senator: I am much ob
liged to you for giving me the oppor
tunity to make clear to the senate
judiciary committee my reasons for
nominating Louis D. Brandels as as
sociate justice of the United States
supreme court. I am profoundly In
terested in his confirmation by the
senate.
"There is probably no more im
portant duty Imposed upon the pre
sident than that of naming members
ot the supreme court, and I need
hardly tell yon that I named Louis
D. Brandels as e, member ot that tri
bunal only because I know that be is
singularly qualified by his learning,
gifts and character for that poaltlon.
"Many charges have been made
against Mr. Brandeie, trot the report
of your sub-committee already has
made plain to you. and to the country
at large how , unfounded these
charges were. They threw a great
deal more light upon the character
and motive of those who originated
the charges than upon the qualifica
tions of Brandels. I myself looked ,
into them three years ago, when I
desired to make Brandels a cabinet
member, and found they proceeded
mostly from those who hated Bran
dels because he refused to be ser
viceable to them for the promotion
ot their selfish Interests, and from
those who had been prejudiced and
misled. The propaganda In this mat
ter hos been most extraordinary and
moat distressing to those who love
falrneB and value the dignity of a
great profession.
"I perceived , from the first that
the charges were lntrlustoally inore
dlble to anyone who had really,
known Brandels. I have known and7
tested him by seeking advice upon
some tf the most difficult and per
plexing questions about which it has
been necessary for me to form Judg
ment. I have dealt with litm In mat
ters were nice questions ot honor and
falrplay as well as large questions of
Justice and the public benefit were
Involved.
"In every matter In which I have
made this test of his Judgment and
viewpoint I have received from Mm
counsel singularly enlightening, sin
gularly clear-sighted and judicial,
and, above all. full of moral stimula
tion. : . . -
