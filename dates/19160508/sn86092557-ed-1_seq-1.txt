Entire Board of Directors
Was Reelected This
Morning.
The entire board of directors was
re-elected at the annual stockholders'
meeting of the Monongahela Valley
Traction company today and a num?
ber of plans for the ensuing year were
discussed. The report of the past year
of the company was satisfactory and
the prospects are even better for in
creased prosperity during the coming
year. The high price of all steel and
other materials that are used by the
cmpany has not impeded the develop
ment of now territory nor delayed the
purchase of new equipment. A num
ber of new cars and other supplies
have been contracted for and will be
received in a few days. The construc
tion of two new branch lines is in
progress near Clarksburg, fr-.m Jane
Lew to Berlin, and the extension ot
the line from Haywood to Bridgeport.
Other new construction is contemplat
ed for the summer and the policy of
extending the lines as fast as the ter
ritory develops will continue to be car
ried on.

To the Boys
Club Workers of West Virginia,
greetings:
It is a pleasure and an honor to
have the privilege of giving you a
few words of greeting and endam
agement.
I have long sinco learned that
If a farmer desires fruit trees of
a certain shape, and fruit of a high
quality and large quantity his
surest way to secure these is
through a young orchard rather
than by pruning and grafting the
old orchard that had a poor start
and poor training. I am oqually
convinced that the shortest cut
and surest method of making pros
perous, happy farmers in West
Virginia is found in the proper
training of our farm boys and 1 con*
aider the Club Work a very import
ant phase of that training. It
pleases me to note that this sub
stanfal basis. In a true sense, the
Joadors in this movement may be
considered educators and states
men.
We need a lot of 4-H men in this
state?men with trained hands and
heads, courageous kind hearts, and
health to back up good work: and
wo are expecting a large crop of
such men from the Club Boys of
the stato.
In your difficulties, I sympathize
with you; *.n your many joys, I
rejoice with you; in your work, I
heartily Join you, for "I was once
a barefoot boy" on the old farm.
Very truly yours,
M. P.SHAWKEY. ,

Mayor Bowen is Asked to
Find Out What Holds
It Up.
TAX ORDINANCE A LAW
Board Accepts Invitation to
Visit Safety First
Train.
It was most too warm this morning j
o the city Board of Affairs to get
up enough enthusiasm to do much,such ?
business as came beforo the body wMft
rushed through with the result thati
the mooting lasted but an hour. Pres-!
ent, to administer and to make laws I
and regulations were Mayor Anthony
Bowen, Finance Commissioner, J. Wal
ter Barnes, Street Commissioner Al
bert Lehman and Water Commission
er Ira L. Smith. City Clerk Albert
Kern acted as amanuensis for the
speakers.
The first and most important mat
ter smoothed over by the Board was
the Great White Way. This so-called
Great White Way is overdue and ac
cording to conservative figures will
be built before the snow falls?per
haps. Mayor Anthony Bowen was in
structed by the members of the board
to look into the Great White Way mat
ter immediately and to report at the
next meeting the reasons why the.
work of constructing the street light
ing system is not progressing.
The tax ordinance which went into
effoct last Monday night when the
city council failed to sit was an
nounced at the meeting as having be
come a law. This license ordinance
and the hog and pig ordnance have
both become effective on account of
the city council which has but voto
powers failing to meet to discuss them.
The city council has powers to veto
these ordinances.?#$? investigation
when an ordinance is passed by the
Board of AfTairs and the council falls
to sit such ordinance bocomes law.
The liquor ordinance was passed ov
er until next Monday morning for sec
ond reading.
The Board, at the invitation of the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad company
officials will attend the "Safety First"
meeting being advertised to &how at
Walker's Siding. May 15. They will
attend the exhibit In a body at 2 p.
m. Water Commissioner Ira L. Smith
has been instructed by the Board to
investigate and alter to purchase a wa
ter pressure valve to be used on the
water tanks which have a habit qf
flowing over and flooding the property
of some neighbors . Heretofore the
water has been turned on every morn
ing at 8 o'clock and turned off at ev
ery afternoon at 4 o'clock. At times
the water has flooded out at 2 o'clock
in the afternoon showing that the
amount of water used daily by Fair
monters fluctuates considerably. The
water tanks were built in 1894 and ev
ery day in the intervening 22 years n
man has turned the water on at 8
o'clock and off at 2 o'clock. This
valve will eliminate the manual labor
attached to the water tanks and will
also be an absolute preventative
against overflowing unless of course
the valve gets out of condition. A
very good valve and one which will
most likely be purchased is a Foster
Engineering Company of Newark, N.
J., product that costs $104.
Water Commissioner Ira L. Smith
was also privileged to purchase six
flro hydrants to be placed at different
places about the city. The Board after
scanning and worrying over figures or
sometime has decided that It is more
economical to buy fire hydrants than
it is to pay $1 per foot for fire hose
which lasts about a year.
The controversy which is existing
betwoon J. L. Torrey of Locust avenue
and a body of Locust avonue cittzens
and which has been shifted upon the
shoulders of the city fathers was put
off for further argument until next
Monday morning. Building permits
?ere granted to Mike Powell and Har
ry B. Scott.

Captains of the Four Teams
Will Meet Tonight to
Completion of the'plans for the Y*
M. C. A baseball league and the ar-'
raugement of the scedule will likely
be accomplished at the meeting to
be held tonight at which the captains
solected for the Tour teams will bo
present. These captains are Maurer,
Toothman , Peters and McDougal.
These men have ail been notified to
meet with Physical Director Bllckley
at 7:30, and the work of choosing team
members from the membership of the
Y. M. C. A. will be begun.
The actual opening of the Y. M. C.
A baseball season is hoped to be held
in a few days and the officials are
making every effort to have the teams
picked so that some preliminary prac
tice may be held before the'first game.
The names for the four teams that
will compose the league will to cho
sen tonight .and it is probable that
the first dates on the scehdule will be
named.
All of the games will be playod at
South Side Park and practically every
member of the Y. M. C. A. who wish
es to engage in the national pastime
will be given the opportunity to play
as much as he can, The idea is not
to develope a few stars that may be
come good enough to join the major
leagues hut to give the various men
of Fairmont who desire to see and
play baseball the chance to do so.
The Y. M. C. A. league last, year was
a splendid, success and from the in
terest that has been shown already
this season the prospects are for a
league that will be even m'oro satis

The correspondent says he obtained
this information from a;'circular >.just;
i88eud by thft Tynans .Hum&iiity

arrival in Rome of envoys from the
Kings of Bavaria and Saxony, who!

Effort to Turn Opponents'
Flank Is Now Going
On.
(B.v Associated rress)
PARIS, May S.?Fighting ot grent
violence continued last night on tho
Verdun front. Furious German at
tacks near Hill 3*04 were broken by
the French, tho War office announced
today.
After 77 days of battle the Germans
are making a new attack before Ver
dun with another formidable army.
Fighting almost equal in violence to
that of the beginning of March is in
progress on both banks of the Mouse.
The principal effort of the Germans
.mg directed against Dead Man
hill. Following the Napoleonic pol
icy of attempting to turn what can
not be carried by frontal attack, the
Germans with a whole, army corps
made the assault by way of the ra
vine between Hill 304 and Dead Man
hill seoking to crush in the French
line along'the front of one and one
half miles. Tho ground there is fa
vorable for. attack and.the French com
mander aware of the weakness of the
position placed one of his best train
ed army 'corps. at - that' place. This
corps disposed of the initial attack
without ceding any important ground,
but the battle is still raging, and ac
cording to the latest advices, the re
sult will not be known until some
tfme today.
East of the Meuso .the Germans de
livered four attacks on a front of 2,000
yards each advance being made by
a different Prussian regimorit. The
fighting there is as fierce as. on the
other side of tho river and as incon
clusive. -
