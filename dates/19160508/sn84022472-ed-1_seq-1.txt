Levine, a peddler, living at 124 Island
Brook avenue was placed under bonds
of $750 in the city court today. Held
in connection nvith the thefts of cop

of more than $3,000 are John Plukas,.
aged 11, 40 . Railroad 1 avenue, Mike

Wallace Rano, aged 8, 294 Main street.
Several other peddlers believed to
have been implicated in the receipt of
the stolen goods are sought today by
the police who . have been compelled
today to make a store canvas on foot

The police say that frjom statements
made by the ' youthful thieves they
were told by Levine to get the copper
and he would buy it. Fearing he
would be traced if he utilized his- reg
ular licensed wagon, the police assert
Levine used another vehicle that bore
no license hmber. Some of the' stolen
property was found in his possession

Simon. "

COMPENSATION
LAW OF STATE
Occupational -Disease Does
Not Cpme Within Scope of
' . Present Legislation
STATE'S ATTORNEY
POINTS OUT DEFECT
Letter of Law As Now Writ
ten Does Not Carry Out
Its Purpose
The next session of the General As
sembly will have the duty of broaden
ing the terms of the Workmen's Com
pensation act, which, by a recent deH
cision or-.tne supreme uourt or jjjt
rors, proves unexpectedly narrow.
That, -this duty will coma to the Gen
eral Assembly is the -opinion of Homer
S. Cummings, and ' his 1 views are
founded upon" the decision in the -trase
of Louis Miller ' vs. American Steel and
wire company or. New jersey. -Speaking
of this- case to a represent
ative of The Farmer, today. Mr. Cum
mings said:' . V. ' r
"In this case the r question arose
whether an employe. Who, had worked
in a room where fumes - from molten
lead arose, from which he contracted
lead poisoning, could recover under'
the .Compensation Act." - Our court
held" that he could not. -
"This decision is important' because
it places an interpretation "Upon the
Workmen's Compensation Act Which
excludes from its operation alt recov
eries due to what are known as 'occupational-
diseases' .Those of us who i
have been interested . in -the passage
and - perfection of our; Compensation
Act and have rejqicwd tha Connecticut
had placed upon its statute books so
humane and enlightened a piece of
legislation will be .disturbed'-, to , find
that the act 4s unexpectedly 'narrdw
in its terms.- " .-.
"The question apparently turned up
on, the interpretation to be placed up
on the words 'personal injury.' Under
the act an employe is entitled to re
cover for a personal injury "arising in
the course of and out of his employ-
ment, The present decision seems to
indicate that this refers only to acci
dental injuries and not to inluries
caused by disease. Of course, it is
manifest that, as a matter of principle.
an occupatiopal disease is as much a
proper subject for compensation as jan
industrial accident. 1 j v - - j
iduetryad society .-mustmaKe,
provision -f or its - victims; TJe real
purpose of the act was to protect our
working ; people against industrial
hazard.. It is. manifest that the spirit
of the law . covers such a hazard
whether it arise . Tfrom accident or
f ronr a disease Contracted in the very
occupation in which the worker was
necessarily, employed.. . :.
"I am not criticising the. decision
of the Supreme Courts of Errors. I
am merely calling attention to the
fact that t-he decision reveals a f3e
fect in our .Workmen's Compensation
Act which should jbe remedied as
speedily as possible." ' ' '
"And the duty or ; proviairrg a
remedy?" . .' "'-
"Is for the General SAssemhly," re

FEW CONTESTS
ARE PROBABLE
IN CONVENTION
Burr, Minor, Fitzgerald and
Kennedy Likely to Be the
x Big Four.
.. . . v
Outward indications are ihat the
Democratic State convention, which
opens tomorrow- evening' at Music
Hall, New Haven, will be a very har
monious gathering. There are no
signs ,of serious .contests for places
in the delegation to the nationafcon
ventiori, and the work of the conven
tion undoubtedly will be conducted
with dispatch.
State Chairman David E. Fitzger
ald will call the convention to order
at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening. The
state central committee, at a meet
ing tomorrow afternoon, will approve
the temporary roll of delegates. Na
tional Committeeman . Homer S.v
Cummings will be introduced as tem
porary chairman and will deliver an
address. '
Immediately after the - temporary
chairman's address , the convention
will recess so that Senatorial caucuses
may be held. . The caucuses will name
members of the various convention
committees. ; The congressional cau
cuses .for the nomination of two dele
gates and alternates to the national
convention will be held after the
senatorial meetings. - v
The convention will meet again at
10 o'clock Wednesday morning, and
it is probable that Mr. Cummings will
be made permanent chairman. The
selection of delegates to the national
conviction - and the adoption of reso
lutions will complete the session's
business.
Pre-convention gossip Jias it -that
the "big four," as the . delegates-at-large
are termed, will .consist of Wil
lie O. Burr, of- Hartf ord ;-former
Senator Alton T. Miners of New -Lon
don;" State Chairman David E. Fitz
gerald, of 'New Haven; and former
Congressman William .Kennedy, of
Naugatuck. The. names of Thomas
Spellacy of Hartford, and Charles W.
Comstock, of Montville, have . also
been mentioned in connection with
the "big four."
The First district .. probably will
name former Congressman Augus
tine Lonergan, Hartford; former: Sen
ator George Mi Landers, of New' Bri
tain; or Michael J. Connors, .of En
field for delegates. -
Former Comptroller Daniel Jr. JJunn.
of Willi mantle; is a possibility for one
of the delegates from the Second dis-.
trict, while the Third district probably
will name former Congressman Thom
as L- Reilly, of -Meriden, and. Major
Jouis p. Stoddard, or JNew iaven. -
Daniel E. Walker, of Brdigeport, has
the endorsement of Bridgeport's nine
teen delegates for one of the Fourth
district's representatives at the na
tional convention. : Charles D. Lock-
wood, of Stamford, --and Hanford S.
Weed, of New Canaan, are other pos
sibilities from this district,
Wom the jrrrth oistrrot, Tormer
Mayor William Thorns, of Waterbury,
John F. Addis, of New Milford, and
E. S. Roberts, of Canaan, are mem-
tloned. V
The committee on the revision of
rules, of which John J. Cullinan of this

a notice received today, by Naturaliza
tion Clerk Flanagan from. Judge

try a El ( Paso. Tex., in Feb!. 1906,
From the ' statement of a man who
entered the country at El Paso with
Stevens it was learned that the real
date of Stevens' entrance was Feb
ruary, 1907. The government offi
cials discovered this and called it to
the attention of Jpdge Thomas.
FEARS FOR SAFETY OP . :
HIS JWXFE AND CHILDREN"
Fears for the safety of his wife and
children, who are in Epros, Greece,
led Thomas S. Adams of 871 State
street to appeal to Naturalization
Clerk M. J. Flanagan. Adams asked
the United States government to pre
vail upon Grecian officials to allow
the family to leave- the country. He
said they had been refused permission
to leave Epros. t '
Clerk Flanagan wrote to Congress
man E. J. Hill, who replied today ask
ing Adams to file an affidavit giving
the facts in the case and stating the
ages of his wife and children. When
the facts are in hand Congressman Hill
says he will see that the attention of
the. Grecian officials is called to the
plight of the Adams family. Mrs. Ad

Greece at the time that country was
drawn into the war zone.

today .where several telephones were
cut off. '
South Main street, the East End and
the ' ' neighborhood of vWater ' street,

didn't take away the wire, merely
putting ,it out of commission and 'go

"We have known of these occur
rences for several weeks and attribute
them to malice. . Some person or per
sons with a grudge must be doing
.it, -:,-' .
'We have had no trouble with our
men who are satisfied with their Jobs,
and it would Vbe Tather far fetched
to suspect any electrical worker who

C. J. Boyle, international organizer
of the .Electrical Workers, heard of
the destruction today and he hasten
ed to say' a word that might offset
Jumping to conclusions.
"This is "unfortunate," , he saidj
"coming at the time of the strike,
because some persons will be all too
ready to blame it on the strikers.
"We have no quarrel with the tele
phone company. The linemen here
aren'torganized and won't be involved
in this strike. Besides, we wouldn't
adopt destructive methods because, ot
the nature of the tfhing in the first

ready be across pie Mexican'
border in pursuit of the bandits j
who raided Glenn Springs and I
Alpine, Texas, last week.
Secretary Baker said today,
he had received a report from I
General Funston as to steps i
taken in that direction but de-l
clined to reveal, its contents.
. He said General Funston's j
original orders still stood, how-;
ever, and they gave him au
thority to cross whenever the
need arose; -
No additional report of the raid had '
reached the department at the time.
On the, basis of . consular despatches
yesterday, however. Secretary Lansing
has forwarded a report to the Mexican,
de facto government" calling attention
to the latest bandit activities along the
border. No specific request was made
for disposition of Carranza troops to
betted protect the. border but state de
partment officials said it was assumed
that prompt pursuit of the raiders al
ready had been ordered by General
his subordinates. ' '
It was believed possible some meth
od of direct co-operation for the ex
termination or, capture of the Glenn
Springs raiders might result from the
conference today, between Generals
Scott and Obregon at El Paso. The
conferees net, yesterday . for the pur
pose of working out the final form of
the agreement they have reached re
garding the border situation, but news
of the Glenn Springs incident and un
confirmed rumops of other raids caus
ed delay.. General Scott reported to
Secretary Baker that after the meeting
today he :expectecl the agreement
would be completed in the light of
these most recent happenings.
The war denartrnfirtt has hparil in.
formally, that General' Carranza ap- j
proved the Scott-Obregon plan with ,
luwmjnor exceptions, out wnai is nos
satisfactory has - not .-stated. It was
hoped here the whele matter Would
be disposed of today by the conferees.
There is no indication at the war de- t
partment that steps were in contem
plation to increase the border forces
dent.' Secretary Baker would not say
whether General "FWinstOTi hnfl -marta
-. -v , .u.w
now recommendations on this ques
tion. It is known that the calling of
a portion . of the National Guard to
aid in the border patrol is not now
under consideration. '
, ' Army officers have feared som
such oceuThsence as that at Glenn
Springs since it became necessary to
"break up the border guard at var
ious towns and ranches. They be
lieve it dangerous to leave a few men
isolated from' larger commands in
positions where - they might be ex
posed to. attack by considerable num
bersof raiders.. It is understood that
company commanders in several in
stances have urged that their com
mands be held together for protec
tion and so placed as to be able to
hurry to any attacked or threatened
point.. ' ; ,
