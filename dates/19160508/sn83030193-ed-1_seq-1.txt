Slope of Hill 301.
PARIS CLAIMS VICTORY.
French War OtTice Says the
Ground Lost Sunday Was
Regained Last Night.
nnrtl.I.V, May 8. In n renewal of
the drive on Verdun from the north
wes. German troops have captured
the entire trench system on tho
northern slope of r 1 1ll 304. the War
OlTlce announced this afternoon. Tho
Germans took 1.320 Froncih prisoners.
German llnea have reached the sum
mit of the hclirht.
The txt of tho War Office state
ment Is as follows:
"Tho operations west of tho Meuan
during recent days have been carried
out principally by brave Potn
mcrnnlnn troops. They were at
tended by CTC.it dimcnltles, but, with
moderate losses, were successful.
Notwithstanding tho tenacious de
fense nnd furious counter attacks of
tho enemy, tho Germans took an
entire system of trenches on the nor
hcrn slope of Hill No. 301. The Ger
man lines reached the top of tho
height. Tho enemy suffered extraor
dinarily heavy losses, so that only
forty unwounded olllcers and 1,280
soldiers wero captured by us. At
tacks by tho enemy on our positions
on the western slope of the hill were
ri-pulsed everywhere with heavy
losses'
"East of the .Mouse, on both sides
of Thlaumont Farm, theto was bitter
fighting. The enemy, along with
other troops, employed negroes In the
fighting east of the farm. Tho attack
broke down, nnd 300 men wero made
prisoners. In the migngenvnta men
tioned fri'Hh French troops were rcc
ognlzod. "In the Mouse sector the enemy has
employed fifty-one divisions. Includ
ing divisions which were used a sec
ond tlmo after being brought up to
full strength, This means fully twice
the forceH put In action by the Ger
mans, who are making the attack.
There are about 12,000 met In
a division, so that, ncccrrdlng to
the German statement, the French
have employed more than tiOO.000
mnn In the battlo of Verdun. It
ban been generally believed that
tho numbor of troops used by
the Germans was much In ex
cess of the 300.000 or so Indicated
In to-day' olllclal report. He.
ports have estlmnted the Crown
Prince's force as high as 750,000.
"On the remainder of the front
there were no imiuirtant develop
ments, aside from successful enter
prises carried out by patrols In tho
district of Tlepvnl and I.lroy.
"After a battlo In tho air two
French biplanes which were over
Coto do Froldeterre fell to earth In
flames."

LONDON, May S,--.Iohn Hedmond,
the Irish leader, put a question to
Mr. Asquith In tho House of Com
mons to-day In which ho suggested
that tho continuance of military exe
cutions In Ireland was causing rap
Idly increasing bitterness nnd ex
asperation nmong a section of the
population which had no .sympathy
with the insurrection. Ho asked
whether, following tho precedent set
by Gen. Hotha In South Africa, tho
Premier would causo a stop to bo put
to executions.
Mr. Asquith replied that from the
very llr.it .Mr. Hedmond had been urg
ing upon the Government arguments
which had not fallen on unwilling
ears In favor of clemency for the
rank and flic. Gen. Maxwell, he wild.
1iud been In direct personal commu
nication with the Cabinet on tho sub
ject. Ho had great uontldonco In tho
General's disci otlon. Gen. MiixwoII'h
Instructions, which conformed to his
own judgment, wore to sanction thu
infliction of the extreme penalty as
sparingly as possible, nnd only In the
case of responsible persons guilty tn
the first degree.
Mr. Ai-qulth said no one was more
anxious than the members of the
Government or Gon. Maxwell hlm
sulf that these cases should bo con
fined within the narrowest limits and
that executions should cease as soon
us possible. The course to be adopted
with regard to tho rank and file was
at present being considered anxiously
by the Cabinet. Steps had been In
Itiatid to asteitaln whether Govern
ment otlltinls wero implicated.
The question of tho Irish rovolt was
first raised In the Commons to-day
by 1aurenre (llnnell, Nationalist. In
response to his question, Mr. Asquith
said that ho could not glvo an un
dertaking that no moro men would
be put to death before opportunity
was given for a discussion of tho
matter In the House, On receiving
this reply, Mrs. Glnnell shouted:
"Murder! Murder!"
James 5tark Sullivan, former I nl'ed
States Minister tn Santo Homlngo,
who was arrostod at Dublin in con
nection with tho rebellion, has been
set freo.
The American F.mbassy received
a letter from Sullivan to-day bring

that lie was .n rested on suspicion of

for eight days.

(RESENTMENT ISSIIOWN
Two Members of Committee'

WASHINGTON, Mny 8. Just as
I the Senate Jlldlelarv Committee.
urged to action by a letter from Presi
dent Wilson, prepared to ballot on
tho confirmation of Iouls D. Hrau
dels ns Justice of the Supremo Court,
two Senators objected to-day. As n
result action, which seemed near,
again was Indefinitely postponed.
Who tho Senators wero tnumhers
of tho committee would not say. Hut
It was understood Senator Shields of
Tennessee, who to-day nttended his
first meeting of tho commltteo In
moutliH, was tho chief objector.
It was learned too that tho Presi
dent's letter. In which he urged quick
action on Ilrandels, was received with
a spirit of resentment by the com
mittee. When tho final break-up
came friends of Ilrandels failed even
In getting nn agreement to vote at
any definite future date.
Tho President wroto the letter In
reply to a note from Senntor Culber
son asking for a stntecnent of "the
reasons which actuated the President
In making tho nomination." In his
letter tho President said:
"My dear Senator' i am very
much obliged to you for giving me an
opportunity to mako clear to the Judi
ciary Committee my reasons for nom
inating Mr. 1.0'uls n. Ilrandels to fill
the vacancy In the Supreme Court of
the Pnlted States created by the
death of Mr- Justice Lamar, for I am
profoundly Interested In the confirma
tion of the appointment by the Sen
ate. "There is probably no more Im
portant duly Imposed upon tin- Piesl
dent In connection with tho general
administration of the Government
than Hint of naming members of the
bupreme Court, and I need hardly tell
you that I named Mr. Hrandels as a
member of that great tribunal onl
because I know him to bo singularly
qualified by learning, by gifts and by
character for Hie position.
"Many charues havo been madn
anaintt Mr. Brandoiti tho report of
your tub-committee hat alrtady mada
it plain to you and to the country at
Inrno how unfounded theie charges
were. They threw a fjreat deal more
liqht upon the character and motive
of thoe with whom they orinlnateri
than upon the qualifications of Mr.
Brandeii. I myself looked into them
three years auo whtn I desired to
make Mr. Brandon a member of my
Cabinet and found that they proceed
ed for the most part from those who
hated Mr. Brandels becausa he had
refused to be serviceable to them in
the promotion of their own selfish in
tercsts, and from thoso whom they
had prejudiced and misled.
"The propaqanda in thio matter hat
been very extraordinary and very dis
tressing to those who love fairness
and valua the dirjnity of the ureal
profession.
"I peicolvod from th first that the

WASHINGTON, May 8. A new American expedition may be
already across the Mexican border in pursuit of the bandits who raided
Glenn Springs and Uoquillas, Tex., last wwk. Secretary Baker sitfi ttwtay
lie had received a report from Gen. Funston as to steps taken in that
direction, but declined to reveal its contents. He said Gen. Ftinston's
original orders still stood, however, and they gave him authority to cross
whenever the need arose.
Unofficial reports from Alpine say that a posse and a detachment
of twenty-three troopers of the Fourteenth Civalry are believed there
to have followed the trail of the Mexicans into Coahuila.
Troops A, J and H of the Eighth Civalry, under command of Major
G. T. I.onghorne, reached Marathon to-day from Ul Paso and Immedi
ately started southwest to Glenn Springs. Two troops of cavalry and a
machine gun company from Fort Clark were expected at Marathon later
this afternoon, and will follow Major l.onghornc's men.
Marathon, almost too miles north of the internatioy tl line, will be
the base of operations From there a field telegraph line will be run to the
advanced base.
Six Americans are reported to have been killed by the Mexican?, at
least part of whom are believed to have been former Carraiuista soldiers
who deserted the garrison at San Vincente, Mexico. Three American
soldiers and a boy were killed outright and two civilians captured by the.
Mexicans are reported to have been put to death later.
Thero Is a strong deninnd that tho President call out tho National
Guard to protect thu Texas border. Ttioro aro ut present less than C.000
mobile, troops In tho regular army which could rclnforco (Jen. Funstou's
forces on tho border and In .Mexico, though If the coast defenses were left
unguarded 14,000 maul artillerymen might bu dcbpatuhcd. It Is known that
tho calling out of n part of tho National Guard Is receiving serious con
sideration. Intimations that more than 500 outlaws might be hiding north
of the border was received from (Sen. I'miston.
