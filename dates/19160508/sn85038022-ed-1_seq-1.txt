Mr. David HechlnBor, clghty-ono
years old, one of tho oldest clothing
merchants in tho stnto of Kentucky,
and pioneer In this city's clothing
trade, passed away nt his home on
West Front street Sundny morning nt
1:30 o'clock nftcr n Bhort Illness of
acuta Indiecstlon.
Mr. Hcchlnger was taken suddenly
111 at his placo of business on West
Second street Saturday morning nbout
10:30 o'clock. His son, Mr. Ferdinand
Hechlngcr, ordered a carriage for him
to ride home In, but ho refused and
walked tho entire dUtnnco unnccom
pnnled. lie began to suffer nnd a doc
tor was cnllcd, and although ho did
everything In his power it was of no
avail and he passed awny nt the hour
mentioned above. At the timo of his
death ho was surrounded by his en
tire family and he retained conscious
ness until the Inst, realizing that the
end was near.
To Mr. Hechln'ger belonged tho dis
tinction of having been In business in
Mnysvllle longer than any of his con
frcrcrs, his Identification with tho com
mercial and merenntito lfo of this
plncu having extended over more than
half a century. Maysvlllc has been In
deed fortunnto to possess nmong her
business men n citizen of his typo, for
ho has ever been progressive, of
sound business methods, of absolute
honesty, charitable and generous, his
career having had a salutary effect
In n wldo clrclo of Influence.
As his name ludlcntcs, Mr. Hcchlnger
Is German, his nativity having occur
red In tho province of Itcln Ilalern
Juno 17, 183E. The names of his par
ents were Joseph nnd Sophia (Felstel)
Hechlngcr. Tho former died when
David was a young lad and the mother
with her two sons nnd a daughter sail
ed for America In 1844, threo years at
ter the head of tho house died.
Tho mother camo to Ilaltlmorc,
Maryland, where she had friends re
siding, believing that her children
would find grentor opportunity await
ing them In tho newer country. David
was reared to young manhood In Haiti-
more and there received his education
attending tho common schools.
When he becamo IB years of ago he
onterrd the ranks of tho wage earn
ers as a clerk in n clothing store for
sovcrul years, or until 1860. In the
meantime his slstter had married Mr,
O. Ilium, who was engaged In business
In this city. Ho induced Mr. Hechlng
er to come to this location and assist
him, which he did In tho year 18C0. He
arrived with thirty-fire cents In his
pocket, but despite his limited capital
received n partnership In his brother
In-law's business. Mr. Ilium tnibse
quently retired nnd died a few years
ago In Baltimore, Mil., nnd until 1888
the Arm was known ns Hechlnger Iiros,
Several minor chnnges occurred in
tho business in tho next few years, but
In 1890 the firm was changed to D.
Hechlnger & Co., nnd hns been called
that since that time. For tho past sev.
oral years Mr. Hcchlngcr's son, Ferdi
nand, nnd Mr. William Trouts, Jr.,
have associated with tho business. For
slxty-slx years Mr. Hechlnger has been
In business hero and during his stay
thero has never been a time that his
store has not been as solid as a rock
and his word regarded as n govern
ment bond.
Mr. Hechlngor was generous as woll
as just nnd his kind heart won for him
ninny loyal admirers. No worthy cause
or worthy person ever appealed to him
and went away empty handed. In this,
as he himself put it, was Incorporated
his religion. Every church erected In
Mnysvlllo since ho enmo hero has been
helped financially by him, Ho was
reared In the Jewish faith nnd was a
firm believer In hla religion. Ho was
very prominent and popular In frater
nal circles, being a Royal Arch Bason.
Knights of Pythias and Elk. He and
Mr. J. James Woods woro tho only sur
vlvlng charter members of tho Mason
County Building Association.
In IstH Mr. Hechlngcr was united In

marrlago to Miss Louisa Cochran,
blessed by the birth of three children.
The elest, Joseph, died December 20,
1907, aged 45 years. Retta is the wife

of C7.
The outpourings at tho various
schools showed that much work had
been done In propnratlon for tho dny

much Importance.
Some of tho schools had excellent
