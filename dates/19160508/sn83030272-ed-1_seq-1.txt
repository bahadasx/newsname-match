long confeience with President WIIon.

dellveieil yesteiday by the apostolic
delegate expiesslng the hope of the IVjie
for an e.irlv tivtoration of pence.

thi'ieby avert an Immediate break lu
( .' . "" ii ..ii mini, ui.tir i,r .ii in

i as having left the whole status of the I

. In addition. It Is explained, the Ger
man noli' Is so worded as to make
t lucld.'itiou necessaiy.
What the tenor of the President's next
communication to Germany will be has
not yet been deeded. It will probably

as American rights hip concerned. Is re-

iefeti nce to the HrltNli blockade
The other View Is that the President i
should bilelly Inform Heilln that -he

pledge to suspend illegal submarine
operations, that tills Government fully
expects tins pledge to be curled out for
reasons of "huinanlly." aside from ill
