OF HUGH'S
GASOLINE
The joy riders, who took Hugh
Cowan's Ford from his garage at 515
' Iowa avenue, last night, might be

thieves than auto thieves, for they
returned the car in apparently good
condition, minus only about four gal-
Ions of high priced operating Juice,
Both the garage and the car were
locked but that did not phase" tho
burglar, for they twisted tho lock
off the garage witn an iron oar, ana
carried their own Ford key to unlock
the car.
Mr. Cowan says ho does not think
the car was taken until after mid
night as tho family were up until
that time and heard no disturbance.
The car was found in an alley near
tho house this morning.

RIGGS BANK
CASE TRIAL
DUE TODAY
High Officers of Washington Institution
Must Answer to Charge of Perjury
in Connection with Alleged
Stock Transactions
By United Tress.
Washington, May 8. With the
leading legal lights of New York and
Yv'ashlngton as advocates and bank
er. throughout the country as audi
ence, the famous Riggs bank case
vas to come to trial here today.
Charles G. Glover, president; Wil
li.! m J. Flather. vice-president, and
Henry H.' Flather, former cashier of
ihe Kiggs National Iwuilc are to ans
wer the charge of perjury in the
district supremo court.
The three men are charged with
testifying falsely that the Riggs bank
did not engage in stock transactions.
Back of the case is the fight that
has raged for a year, or since tho
)ii;gs bank officials charged Secre
tary of the Treasury McAdoo, John
Skelt'jn Williams, Comptroller of the
Cturency and other treasury officials
.villi conspiracy to wreck tho bank.
"j he bank officials plead that the
stock transactions, alleged by the
ROveniin-nt to have been with the de
funct Lewis, Johnson & Company in
the name of the bank, were those of
the bank's customers.
Samuel Untermeyer, chief counsel
for the treasury officials in the con
spiracy suit, is expected to act in an
advisory capacity to U. S. Attorney
Laski-y, prosecutor. For the bank of
ficials, the star corporation lawyers
of Washington are acting.
The fight between Williams and
the bank officials has been bitter.
Charges of perjury, bad faith and
general undosirability havo flown
back and forth between them ever
ince the spring of 1913.
Upon the acquittal of tho official!
or their resignation hangs tho renew
al of the charter of tho Riggs bank
one of the oldest and strongest out
side of New York. Williams has
hinted that he will, not renew the
charter if the present officers remain
in charge unless they are freed of
the perjury charge against thorn.
It is possible the trial will not
bo ever before the present charter
of the bank expires July 1.
The government charges Z'M items
of stock dealing by the bank. The
fact that tho company with which
tue transactions allegedly were made
Is defunct was another angle expect
ed to be considered.
The fact that the trial started to
day was a defeat for the., bank offi
cers, who tried to have it advanced
.n the calendar to nsrure its com
pletion before the time for renewal
of the charter.

Cscar Harris, who secured second
place in the hammer throw. The
High School Booster received hon
orable mention among the student 1
publications but no reward. j
Said Principal Morrow of the high i
i
school: "We were not ashamed of
our few points but proud of tlmm, for

such as Tulsa, Muskogee, and Mc.M-
ester, did not win a point.- We feel j
that we lacked the long experience
of tho winning schools as this is
really tho first time we havo taken a(

VET AIRMAN
VICTIM OF
ACCIDENT
Capt. J. Hector Worden, Well Known id
Chickasha, Falls to Death from Spec
lacular Practice Flight Near
Dallas
FATAL DASH AFTER
SPIRAL DIVE TURN
Manoplane Collapses and Shoots lo Earth;
Body of Airman Being Broken into
Bits; Drops 1,500 to
2,000 Feet
Captain J. Hector Worden. retaranj
aviator who entertained the crowds)
in Chickasha on two fourth of. July;
occasions, will fly no more. He wa
the victim ot a fatal fall from a flight
in a field on the Greenville road neat"
Dallas late Saturday afternoon, thai
catastrophe following an attempt taj
turn to the right while doing the suU
ral dive.
Captain Worden was well known
hero. Last July he gave a spectacu
Iar performance called the "Bom
bardment of Liege." Tbe Dallast
Times-Herald tells the story ot hl
last flight as follows:
A little group of spectators Include
ing Tiis mechanician, Frank Smithy
was at the roadside at the Wordenj
landing. He had been steadily as
cending during the first half hour o$
his flight, which was uneventfuL
Then, when at a height of about 1504
or 2000 feet, Worden began his ait
trick practice. ? ,
One loop, made as perfectly as anjj
one could perform the feat, was the
sura total of his effort. Worden conn
pleted the loop and was flying on hist
back. He bogan a spiral dive an$
turned to the right. )
"It was the same thing which kill'
ed Lincoln Beachey," said Frank;
Smith, his right-hand man, in describ
ing the accident. "It cannot be done.
Spiral dives are made to the left o$
to death."
Worden fell like a shot from thai
sky when his great bird-like mono
plane turned with the peculiar twisn
of the Incompleted spiral, and hurtled
through space. Once, Smith said, he
seemed to have a chance. Then again
the peculiar collapse like that of a
wounded bird, and machine and man
were one tangled mass in the center
of the prairie.
The group which had been watch'
ing his flight, and then with baied
breath, his struggle with fate, quickly;
cranked the machines standing wait
ing and rushed across the field to
wheer the wreck lay.
"Worden was crushed, literally;
crushed." said Smith in describing the!
accident. "He had fallen with terri'
ble swiftness, as the engine was puUV
ing to the ground and didn't stop mv
til it landed. ' It was a headlong diva
and he was beneath all the wreckage.-
"His skull was sr;aehd, hia body
torn, and both legs were fractured to
bits. His face didn't seem human
distorted and torn by something jag
gew. When we picked him up. one of
his legs almost fell away, and bits of
bone almost a handful, fell out of
a great cut on the inside of the limb.
I do not believe there was a whola
bone in his body."
Tho machine was matchwood, twist'
cd iron and tattered canvas. The en
gine, pinning Worden to the ground
and certain death, was buried so deep
ly in the soil that it took the strength!
of six men, with a heavy timber tor a
lever, to pry it out. One cylinder was(
torn completely loose from the others.
During the first breathless drop of
a thousand feet, it seemed once that
the monoplane would right Itself.
Then came his greatest struggle, and
sealed somewhere in the tangled
wreck of his machine is the answer
to why he failed. Under the severe"
strain something gave way or thu
plane wings collapsed.
Capt. Worden has been a consistent
air performer for seven years, and has
seen some service In the military
field. He had the reputation for be
ing the only aviator ever employed by
a Mexican army. For several montha
hS was a Bcout for Gen. Carranza's
mala army when tho first chief was
