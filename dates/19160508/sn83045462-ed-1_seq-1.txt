LONDON, May 8.?The Germans
are continuing the furious
offensive at Verdun which gained
them important ground both east
and west of the Meuse yesterday.
They made no further advances
during their attacks of last night,
however. Paris declares, and, in
fact, lost part of the territory won

drive in force on the defenses of

The principal German gain Sunday
was northeast of Verdun,
where a footing was gained in the
French first line on a front of
500 meters between Haudromont
wood and Fort Douaumont. During

Rivals March Offensive.
I'ARIS, May S.?After seventy-seven
days of battle the Germans are making
a new attack before Verdun, with
another formidable army. Fighting almost
equal in violence to that of the
beginning of March is in progress on
both banks of the Meuse.
The principal effort of the Germans Is
being directed against I>cad Man hill.
Following the Napoleonic policy of attempting
to turn what cannot be carried
by frontal atack. the Germans,
with a whole army corps, made th* as ault
by way of the ravine between
hill 304 and I>ead Man hill, seeking to
crusn in nir rrim.ii line oiuii(^ n iiviu
of one and one-half mile*. The ground
there is favorable for attack, and the
French commander, aware of the
weakness of the position, placed one
of his best trained army corps at that
place.
Battle Still Is Baglng.
This corps disposed of the Initial attack
without oeding any important
ground, but the battle still is raging,
and according to the latest advices the
result will not be known till some
time ?oday.
East of the Mouse the Germans delivered
four attacks on a front of 2,000
yards, each advance being made by a
different Prussian regiment. The fighting
there is as fierce as on the other
aide of the river, and as inconclusive.
Fighting continued with great violence
throughout last night. Furious German
attacks near Hill 304 were broken
by tho French, the war office announced
today. Ths losses of the Germans are
described as extremely heavy.
Drive Germans Prom Trenches.
The Frsnch attacked east of Hill 304
and drove the Germans from a communication
trench which they penetrated
yesterday. East of the Meuse
there was a series of night engagements.
The Germans were driven
from a trench south of Haudremont.
which they occupied yesterday, an?J
thirty men. including two officers, were
captured.

!
Panel Exhausted Without ObI
taining a Jury at the First
Day's Session.
ELEVEN IN THE JURY BOX
WHEN A HALT IS CALLED
j Both Sides Are Exerting Extreme
Care in the Examination
of Talesmen.
The entire panel of twenty-six talesmen
was exhausted in an effort to oh-|
tain a jury for the trial of officers of;
the Riggs National Rank on the charge i
of perjury in Criminal Division 1 of the'
District Supreme Court today. The in-j
dictments are individually against
Charles C. Glover, president; William .1
Flather. vice president, and Henry H.
Flather. former cashier, of the bank,
and against the officers collectively.
The charges grew out of an injunction
suit of the bank against Secretary
McAdoo and Controller of the Currency
Williams, who were accused of conspiracy
to wreck the institution.
The prosecution today exercised the
[right of challenge for cause twice and
peremptory challenge seven times. The
defense made peremptory challenges
six times. Each side is allowed ten peremptory
challenges, and it is probable
that there will be a lively discussion
tomorrow, as some of the attorneys
propose to contend that they should
have thirty peremptory challenges
Prominent attorneys in court today expect
that the entire session tomorrow
will be consumed before a jury is selected.

the case and advised that they
should not even read newspaper reports
about it.
Court will convene again at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning.
Defendants Are in Court.
The defendants were all In court
when the case was vailed. Ex-Senator
William A. Clark of Montana chatted
with Mr. Glover before court opened.
Many attorneys of the. District bar
were in court throughout the proceedings,
as were also a number of members
of Congress.
Prosecution for the government 1s in
charge of John K L askey. United
States attorney, assisted by William C.
Fitts. assistant attorney general, who
is special counsel for the government
in this rase, arid James B. Archer, assistant
United States attorney. William
E. Leahy, who has been engaged in
trying cases before the present Jury,
sat with the counsel for the prosecution,
advising as to the personnel of
the jury.
The attorneys for the defense are
J. J. Darlir^ton, Frank J. Hogan. William
G. Johnson, Daniel W. O'Donoghue
and George T. Hoover. Mr. Darlington
announced at the opening of court
that ex-Gov. John B Stanchfleld of
New York will co-operate with the
attorneys for the defense. Mr. Stanchfleld
was last here defending George
E. Green, state senator of New York,
during the post office probe, and he
was acquitted.
Are Being Tried Jointly.
Mr. I-askey, In opening the case, asked
that the defendants be arraigned. The
defense waived the reading of the indictment.
and the three bank official*#
are being tried at the same time under
all the indictments, both jointly and individually.
Each one stood and pleaded
not guilty.
Assistant United States Attorney
Archer made a statement of the case
to the talesmen.
Extreme care in selecting the Jury
was shown by the careful manner in
which each van examined. United
States Attorney Laskey put the questions
for the prosecution and George P.
Hoover an^ Daniel W. O'Donoghue alternated
in asking questions for the
defense. The general trend of these
questions was w nmici in? pn/Bjici;u?c
juror was ever employed by the I'nited
.States government or whether any
members of his family were employed
by the government; whether they had
any acquaintance with the attorneys in
the case, whether they knew the
defendants: whether they ever
mad'- deposits or secured loans
at the Riggs National Bank or associated
institutions; whether they
had -read from the newspapers about
the civil suits or the indictments;
whether they had formed an impression
as to the guilt or innocence of the
defendants; whether they were employed
by persons who had contracts
with the government or who were doing
business with the Riggs Bank;
w tier her they themselves engaged in
stock dealings or had any prejudice
against persons or institutions engaged
in stock dealings; whether they
knew detectives employed by the district

prosecution were Joseph K. Dyer, a

the Washington <Jas Light Company,
living at J7M l^anier place. Both admitted
that they had formed very
strong impressions as to the guilt or
innocen? e of the defendants, and think
their minds would not lie impartial on
entering the jury box, and that it
would take considerable to wipe away
their biased opinions. Attorney Hoover,
for the defense, took exception in both

PRESIDENT TO SEND
BRIEF ACCEPTANCE
OF BERLIN PEEK
No Break in Relations So Long
as Latest Submarine
Promise Is Kept.
TO GIVE NO ASSURANCE
OF PRESSURE ON ALLIES
Document Practically Completed and
May Go Forward Without
Conference of Cabinet.
NOTE FROM POPE IS SECRET
Message From Pontiff Supposed to
Bear on Submarines and Peace
Is Withheld From the
Public.
A note to Germany practically
ha? been completed and probably
win go lorwara to Berlin today.
Tt will be made public soon afterward.
It is understood it will be brief,
informing Germany that as long
as the new instructions to submarine
commanders are observed
diplomatic relations will be continued,
but that the United States
cannot allow Germany to dictate
its negotiations with Great
Britain.
Agreed as to Policy.
The President worked on the proposed
communication early today following:
his conference with Secretary
Lansing last night. It is understood
officials arp so far agreed on the policy
to be pursued that it will not be
necessary to wait for the cabinet meeting
tomorrow.
While the German note has averted,
for the present at least, a break in
diplomatic relations, tt was said today
that the President was not satisfied
with the apparent conditions at- ,
tached by Germany.
U. S. Stands by Demands.
The United States stands by its demand
that Germany cease her attacks
on vessels in violation of international
law regardless of negotiations which
may be carried on with Great Britain
over the food blockade. Some of his
advisers wanted him to make no reply
fo the German note and only wait
developments, but he is understood to
have decided to send the new communicatlon.
tt was authoritatively stated that
should another ship carrying American
citizens be sunk by a German submarine
in violation of the principles of international
law diplomatic relations would
be severed just as soon as the facts were
established, and without further exchange
of communications.
Pope's Message Kept Secret.
Efforts to obtain the text of the message
from Pope Benedict to the President
on the submarine situation and
peace delivered by Mgr. Bonzano. the
apostolic delegate here, yesterday were
unavailing. At both the White House |
and the papal legation it was said nothing
would be given out.
In connection with the peace suggestions
in the German note .the attention
of officials was attracted here today by
a passage in a statement given out in
London last night by Lord Robert Cecil,
minister of war trade, in which he j
mentioned the discussion of peace by
Germany, and added that "our attitude, i
at any rate, is unchanged." This statement
was regarded as meaning that the |
allies were not re?*Hy to discuss peace j
on Germany's terms. .
Ambassador Gerard Denies 1
That He Ever Sought Break

BERLIN. May fl. via London, May 8.
? In an interview In the National Zeitung.
James W. Gerard, the American
ambassador, is nuot d as saying:
"In this crisis, as in all previous crises,
I attached the greatest value to
removing misunderstandings between
Germany and America, and did everything
in my power that a conflict between
the two countries might be
avoided. I want no war between Germany
and America. I have never wanted
and shall never want one.
"1 asure you that the accusation that

wrong. I have never done anything to
justify the charge that I hate German
characteristics or German men."
One of the stories to which the ambassador
referred resentfully was that
his wife had bedecked her dog with a
decoration the kaiser had conferred on
her and taken the animal for a walk
in inter den Linden
Against those who have maligned
him Ambassador Gerard appeals to
leading personages of the German government.
who, he declares, the Quoted
newspaper Interview states. know
that he has done and js doing everything
possible to preserve peace between
Germany and the I'nited states.

THE
HHF
ON SEW BALLOT
Managers of G. 0. P. Candidates
to Hold Voters in
Leash at Convention.
SUCCESS WILL PREVENT
WALK-OVER FOR HUGHES
Long Contest Then May Follow.
With Course Boosevelt Pursues
Being Big Factor.
It lg ascertained by conversations
with men affiliated with opposing candidates
for the republican presidential
nomination to be their opinion that
if the second ballot In the national
convention can be had without any
candidate showing a commanding
lead, the likelihood of a stampede to
either Hughes or Rooosevelt will be
averted, with the contest thereafter a
free-for-all affair and the chances of
several of the leading candidates approximately
even.
As one of them expressed it: "If
Hughes is not nominated on the second
ballot, or his nomination forecasted
by the vote, his chance for a walkover
will be gone and his friends will
have to fight for his nomination."
Aim to Prevent Stampede.
I As stated in The Star yesterday, every
I efTort will be exerted by the field to
I hold their forces on the second ballot
and prevent a rush to Col. Roosevelt
or Justice Hughes. If they can accomplish
that, they expect to enter
, upon a period of test voting, conference
I and trading, each man fighting for his
I own hand.
Inasmuch as the belief is widespread
that Roosevelt, failing to obtain the
nomination himself, will prefer either
of several men over Hughes, each man
think he will have a chance for the
colonel's favor. Politicians say that
while the colonel would support Mr.
Hughes when nominated, they think
his name is a? the bottom of the list of j
men the coJonei would choose. (
The first ballot will not only be in-I
conclusive, but will be absolutely de- |
ceptive; a snare and a delusion, in fact. '
No candidate will permit his full j
strength to be displayed on the first
ballot; he will hold out some votes;
i to make a showing of increase on the
succeeding ballot. Thus the Cummins
managers, if they have 172 delegates I
in leash, as they claim, would vote, say, I
I 340 of them and distribute the others'
[ among the low men. Ford or La Fol- !
lette. Then, on the second ballot they I
! would take them out of cold storage j
and cast them, thereby showing an ap- i
parent gain. j
To Come Out in Open.
I So this game of "Brer Fox, he lay J
low." will be played by each of the 1
high men until they have' to come out !
in the open on the second ballot. From j
that time --on. finesse arid strategy i
will be laid aside and it will be a|
straightaway fight for delegates, catch j
. ^ i
as eaten un. ? I
It is thought likely that after the second
ballot there will be a recess, to allow the
leaders and the heads of the larger delegations
to confer?"to put their cards on
the table, face up." as it is said. The
third ballot will be another try-out of
strength, developing the trades made in
the interim. After that nobody knows
how long the contest will run. The best
opinion is that it will depend very much
upon the course Col. Roosevelt pursues,
for no one denies for an instant that he
will play an Important part In th? choosing
of the candidate.
The convention will assemble Wednes
INTERRUPTED CONFERS N(
day. one day later in the week than I
usual, and threatens to run over Sunday. 1
which, in such event, would he devoted I
to conferences. If there is a deadlock. |
Wednesday will be taken up with the
temporary organization. Thursday devoted
to perfecting the permanent organization,
Friday to the platform and nominating.
and the voting probably will begin
Saturday.
Three Second-Ballot Estimates.
From first hand sources, in three op- ^
posing camps. The Star has obtained
estimates of their approximate strength
on the second ballot. As will be noted,
they vary materially, but they were presented
in good faith as the expectation
of the several authors. Here they are:

George M. Bowers. b
e:
Th3 managers of the republican con- a
gressional campaign committee are im- ai
mensely gratified over the action of (*ol. **
Roosevelt in telegraphing a ringing in"dorsement
of the candidacy for Congress
of George M. Bowers in the second
West Virginia district. tl
His support is ail the more valued j
from the fact that two years ago the L
colonel opposed Mr. Bowers' candidacy si
in favor of a progressive candidate, ?
which resulted in the election of a p
democrat. p
National significance also is seen in
Col. Roosevelt's course, as this is the
first time since the break in 1912 that
he has openly indorsed a regular re- d;
publican. Politicians here construed a.'
this as forecasting intention upon the
part of the colonel to work with the
old party.

EL PASO, Tex.. May 8.?Gen. I
Obregon, minister of wafr of the n
de facto government, announced !c
tliat the next conference with j b
Gens. Scott and Funston would j a
be held today. j r
Indirect Effect of Raid. | c
Gens. Scott and Funston regarded the j t
military operations in the Big Bend region
of Texas, caused by the incursion
Friday night by a Mexican raiding party,. C
as only indirectly related to the confer- |
ences begun for the purpose of secur- I
ing greater co-operation between the I
American troops in Mexico and those j
of the de facto government. It was
realized, however, that military developments
in the next day or two might y
cause further delay.
(Jen. Obregon has been assured that
the American representative has said r<
I the last word. and. it was reported, told I t|
that he could gain nothing more by I
further parley. It was said at his,"
headquarters today that there appeared j w
little doubt that he would be pre- g
pared to conclude negotiations perhaps
this afternoon.
B Overnight reports received by (Jen. s;
Funston added little to the information 0
i regarding the raid by Mexicans Friday .
night. Later reports indicated that the
size of the attacking party was greater s
than at first believed, some estimates 0
being as high as 300. The raiders at- b
tacked the guard of nine men of Troop .
| A of the 14th Cavalry, at Glenn Springs.
just before midnight.
The total number of killed was placed 0
at six. three soldiers and three civilians, r
two of whom are small boys. After con- r
tinuing their raid to Deemers and Bo- e
quillas. they were reported to have re- C
crossed into Mexico, although some of the
military reports indicated that a part ot
the Mexican force was yet on the American
side.
Capt. Cole at Glenn Springs. 1
1 Capt. Cole of the 11th Cavalry arrived r
at Glenn Springs this morning with part n
of one company, and four troops of
cavalry sent from Fort Bliss and Fort a
Clark are expected to detrain early today c
at Marathon, from where the march to the
border would be begun. It was not ex- g
Ipected.that this force would reach the
border before Wednesday night, and per- p;
J haps not before Thursday. The actual , *
I distance they will have to march is 110
miles. r*
The additional troops being sent into pi
the region will be disposed of in such a w
manner as to give to the ranchers and b<
towns greater protection, but it was indi- u
cated at Gen. Funston's headquarters dt
that fresh efforts would be made to have
the War Department add to the p;
strength of the forces in the southern t*
department. If it is decided to send into b?
Mexico from that part of the interna- Stional
line a punitive expedition, a much (J
larger force is necessary than is now ni
available, according to army officers. ki
Heroism of Sergt. Smyth. tJ
Lieut. Norton of the 14th Cavalry cc
sent to headquarters a dispatch that ot'.
confirmed earlier reports and added
information regarding the heroic fight *; y
made by Sergt. Smyth, who continued at
to handle his men in efficient manner be
after he had been seriously burned, ni)
and who rescued his wounded and re- po
moved his dead while under a sharp

A new American expedition

border in pursuit of the

nd Alpine, Tex., last week. See
etarv Baker said today lie had reeived
a report fronf (ien. Futisnn
as to steps taken in that direcion.
l)ut declined to reveal its
ontents.
He said ( ien. Funston's origins'
irders still stood, however, and
hey gave him authority to cross
chenever the need arose.
No additional report of the raid had
pached the department at the time. On
tie basis of consular dispatches yesteray,
however. Secretary I^ansing has forwarded
a report to the Mexican de facto
overnment calling attention to the latest
andit activities along the border. No
pecifle request was made for disposition
f Oarranza troops to better protect the
order, but State Department officials
aid it was assumed that prompt pursuit
f the raiders already had been ordered
y Gen. Obregon, the Mexican war minster,
or his subordinates.
It was believed possible some method
f direct co-operation tor the extermitation
or capture of the Glenn Springe
aiders might result from the confernce
today between (Jens. Scott and
ibregon at El F'aso.
Meeting of the Conferees.
The conferees met yesterday for the
urpose of working out the final form
f the agreement they have reached
egarding the border situation, but
ew*K of the Glenn Springs incident
nd unconfirmed rumors of other raids
aused delay.
(ien. Scott reported to Secretary

spected th^ agreempnt would be coml^ted
in the light of these tnosf re?nt
happenings. The War Department
as heard informally that Gen. Oarinza
approved the Scott-Obregon

hat part is not satisfactory has not
aen stated. It was hoped here the

by the conferees
There was no indication at the deait
ment that steps were in cormplation
to increase the border forces
causp of the Glenn Springs incident.
?cretary Baker would not say whether
en. Funston had made new recoro*
lendations on this question. It Is
nown that the calling out of a poron
of the National Guard to aid in
te border patrol is not now under
msideration.
\rmy officers have feared some such
eurrence as that at Glenn Springs
me it became necessary to break up
le border guard into squad patrols
various towns and ranches. The>
lieve it dangerous to leave a few
en isolated from larger commands in
isitions where they might be exposed

iders. It is understood that company
nimanders in several instances have
ged that their commands be held totlier
for protection and so placed as
be able to hurry to any attacked ?r
reatened point.
