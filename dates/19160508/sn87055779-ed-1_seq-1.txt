Wilson Lauds Brandeis
Explaining Nomination
For Supreme Court
Senate Committee Sets No
Day For Vote on Confirma
tion of Nominee, However.
International News Service:
WASHLVCToN. May S. Despite
the fact thai there was before them
a letter from Fret Wilson prac
tically demanding the confirmation
of luis D. Hrandeis of Hostn. to Ve
an associate justice of the supreme
court, the members of the senate
judiciary committee totlay failed to
set a date for a vot rn the piestton.
The committee held an executive ses
sion at which Sen. Culberson, chair
man, presented the l'itrr from the
president and asked for a vote n
whether the nomination should be
favorably reported to the senate.
Several of the members objected and
an adjournment without action was
ordered until Wednesday.
The president's letter was as fol
lows: "My dear Senator: It am very
much obliged to you for giving me
an pportunity t make clear to the
judiciary committee my reasons for
nominating Mr. Ixmis T. Frandeis
to fill the vacancy in the supreme
court of the Fnited States created by
the death of Mr. Justice bim.ir, for
I am profoundly interested In the
confirmation of the appointment
by the senate.
"There is probably no more im
portant duty imposed upon the pres
ident in connection with the gen
eral ml min ist rat ion if the govern
ment than that of naming members
of the supreme court: and 1 need
hardly tell yon that I named Mr.
Hrandeis as a member of that rreat
tribunal only because I knew him to
be singularly juallfied by learning,
by gifts anil by character for the
positio n.
Charges I'nfoundetl.
"Many charges have been made
against Mr. Hrandeis; the report of
your sub-committee has already
made it plain to you ami to the
country at large how unfounded
those charges were. They threw a
great deal more light upon the char
acter and motives of those w:th
whom they originated than upnn the
qualifications of Mr. Hrandeis. I
myself looked into them three years
ago when F desired to make Mr.
Hrandeis a member of my cabinet
and found tliat they proceeded for
tlie most par! from those who hated
Mr. Frandeis because he had refuse, I
to be serviceable to them in the pro
motion )f their own selfish interest,
and from those whom they had
prejudiced and misled. The propa
ganda in this matter has been very
extraordinary and very tlist ressi ng to
those who love fairness and value
the dignity of the great professions.
"I perceived from the first that
the charges were intrinsically in
credible by any one who had really
known Mr. Hrandeis. I have known
him. I have tctel him by seeding
his advice on some of the most dif
ficult and perplexing public ques
tions about which it was necessary
for men to form a judgment. I
have dealt with him in matters
where nice questions of honor and
fair play, as well as large questions
of justice and the public benefit,
were involved. In verv mitter in
which I have made t.-t of his judg
ment and point of view I have re
ceived from him counsel sinsrularlv
clear-lighted and judicial and above
nil. full of moral stimulation. H is
a friend cf all Just men and a lover
U. S. Super-Dreadnaught
of the right; and he knows more
than how to talk about the right
he knows how to set it forward in
the face of its enemies. I knew
from direct personal knowledge of
the man what I was loing when I
named him for the highest ami most
responsible tribunal of the nation.
Fuller IV.iisod Him.
"Of his extraordinary ability as
a lawyer no man who is competent
to judge can speak with anv tiling
but the highest admiration. You
will remember that in the opinion
if the late Chief Justice I- tiller Ii1
was the ablest man who ever ap
peared before the suniprenie court
if the Fnited States.
" 'He is also.' the chief justice
added, 'a bsol u t ely fearless in the dis
charge of his duties.
"Those who have resorted to hlin
for assistance in settling treat in
dustrial disputes can testify to Iiis
fairness and love of justice. In the
troublesome controversies hetvveen
the garments workers and manufac
turers of New York city, for ex
ample, he gave a truly remarkable
proof of his judicial temperament
and had what must have been thp
great satisfaction of rendering le
cisions which both sides were willing
to accept as disinterested and even
ha nded.
"I did not in unking choice of
Mr. Hrandeis ask for or depend up
on 'endorsements. I acted upon pub
lic knowledge and personal ac
quaintance with the man and pre
fereri to name a lawyer for this
great orlke whae aMhties and t har
a ter were so widely recognized teat
he- needed no emlorscnent. I dul.
however, personally consult manv
