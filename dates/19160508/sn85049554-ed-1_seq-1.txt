little temporary shack in which the

the single sentinel could raise an
alarm. The time was about, 11 o'clock
at night.
The attaoloers rushed madly on the
shack, shouting "Viva Villa!" and
'Viva Carranza!'- They were met by
a sturdy defensfe from the half-asleep
Americans, however, and failed in their
evident' attempt' to make .a quick cap
ture of the patrol guard.
All Aft Slioti',
From 11 until after 2 o'clock In the
morning Sergeant Smith fought the
Mexicans from the shelter of the'patrol
house. In that time three-of his men
were killed, and he and all the rest
were wounded... Then the shack caught
fire.
It was impossible to stay any longer,
Sergeant Smith ordered a retreat. Two
of his men were so. badly wounded it
was necessary .to carry them.
Smith not only succecded in remov

as well, carrying the bodies to a place
of safety.
At noon there was no sign of a con
ference. It was reported on the Mexi

MAY ALREADY BE
ACROSS BORDER
Army Officers 8ay Villa May Have
Headed Outlaws in Latest Raid
Towns Attacked in Wildest Section
of
Texas Border and One Regiment
Left With Duty of Guarding Frontier
of 400 Miles.
Washington, May 8.—A new Ameri
can expedition already may be across
the Mexican border in pursuit of Villa
bandits who raided Glenn Springs and
Alpine, Tex., last week. Secretary Baker
said -today General Funston reported as
to steps taken in that direction. He
said General Funston's original orders
stood and they gave him authority to
cross whenever the need arose.
Secretary Raker stated that the war
department considered the agreement
under which the army began the pur
suit of Villa bandits still in operation
and that under its terms General Fun
ston. will take any steps necessary to
purpue the band which Friday night
raided the Big Bend country without
instructions.
Army officers considered it possible
tho not entirely probable that Villa
might have participated in the attack,
which occurred Friday night. Indica
tions that more than oOO outlaws might
be hiding in the hills south of the bor
der w&s suggested by General Funston.
The apparent ease with which the
raid was conducted gave rise to fears
that it might be duplicated at a number
of other localities.
Word Sent to Carranza.
No additional report of the raid had
reached the department at tho time. On
the basis of consular dispatches yes
terday, Secretary Lansing has for
warded a. report to the de facto govern-
assumed that prompt purauit of the
raiders had been ordered bjr^General
Obregon or his subordinates.
It was,believed possible that some
.definite co-operation for the capture of
the raiders might result from the con
ference today between General 9cott
and General Obregon. It is said- Gen
eral Caxranza apjjroved the Scott-Ob-,
regan plan with minor exceptions
No Surprise to Army Officers.
There' was no Indication at the de
partment that steps were in contem
plation- to increase the' "border forces
because of the Glenn Springs Incident
Secretary Baker would not say whether
General Funston had made representa
tions on this question.
Army officers have feared some such
occurrence as that at Glenn Springs
since it became necessary to break up
the border guard Into squad patrols.. It
is Understood that company command
ers in several instances have urged that
their commands be held together fcr
protection.
The state department today received
a report of the raid agreeing with those
received from General Funston and
with, press dispatches.
U. 8. FORCE INADEQUATE
Qne Regiment Patrols 400 Miles of
Wild Border Country,
San Antonio, Tex., May 8.—A section
of Company iH, signal corps, will leave
Fort Sam Houston today .fry? (Marathon
to establish a telegraph line from thaf
point to Glenn Springs, the scene of
the latest Mexican border bandit raid.
The distance is about eighty-five
miles. 'Captain Herbert Evans is in
command of the section which will "be
rushed to iMarathon by, a special train
over the Southern Pacific. The sec
tion will carry Its own telephones,
mules and wagons, so there will' be no
delay In stringing the line.
Army officers here are hopeful that
the Glenn Springs affair will arouse
the war department to the pressing
need of more troops for border duty.
General Funston had asked for ./more
troopB but the request was not grant
ed.
The nine soldiers attacked at Qlenn
Springs belonged to a regiment the
Fourteenth cavalry, thait has. been at
tempting to patrol a stretch of nearly
400 miles of the wildest country along

While the German note has

WILSON DEFENDS*
COURT NOMINEE
Urges Confirmation of Brandeis' Nomi
nation to Supreme Court, In Letter
to Senate—No Action By Senate
Committee.
Washington, May 8.—President Wil
son's letter giving his reasons for nomi
nating Louis D. Brandeis to the su
preme court, and urging his confirma
tion, was read to the senate committee
today by Senator Culberson, but no
yote was taken as had been expected
and no time was fixed for one.
President Wilson characterized the
charges against his nominee as "in
trinsically Incredible to any one who
really knows Mr. Brandeis," and de
clared "they proceed for the most part
from those who hated Mr. Brandeis be
cause he had refused to aid in their
own selfish interests."
The president added "that the propa
ganda in this matter has been very ex
traordinary and very distressing to
those who love fairness and value the
dignity of the great professions."
The president said he believed the
reports of the sub-committee, which
Investigated the nomination had al
ready made it plain that the charges
were unfounded. He said he had
seriously considered appointing Mr.
Brandeis to his cabinet three yeats
ago and at that time examined hfe
qualifications very thoroughly. He
added that he had tested Mr. Brandeis
by seeking advice on perplexing ques
tions and had dealt with him "with
nice questions where the public benefit
was involved."
The president characterized Mr.
Brandeis as a friend of all Just men
and a lover of the right.
