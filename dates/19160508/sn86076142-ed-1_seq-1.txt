Ing to the Murrays on Murray hill
down near the Victor mine. The ml .-j
ale flew wide of the mark and killed ;
a spaniel belonging to another party. ,
The serious part ia that the bulloisl
flew close to the head of John Jones '
an ore sorter working In the Victor
dump and came within a few inche
of the head of little Jack Schweble
only six years old who was starting
for school.-
The residents of that vicinity are
enraged to think the county commls

risk of audden death at the hands
of the bully on whom they have con
ferred extra police power and, It is i
asserted, that unless some action is
taken to curb, the bloodthirsty In

take the law Into their own hands
It was fortunate for Jefferson that
none of them living In that vicinity

REPUCIMBOLOOIIE
CONGREGATION OF 8T. PATRICK'8
IN FAVOR OF ERECTING A
" NEW BUILDING
The congregation of St. Patrick's
church at a meeting yesterday morn
ing absented to the suggestion that a
new building would be more compa
tible with the dignity and numbers of
the flock and considered plans and
proposals for alterations to the old
church and also for the construction
of a stone structure to take the place
of the present edifice located on Jim
Hutler ground. The sense of the meet
ing favored a new building which
would cost comparatively little more
than what would be required to ren
der the present church safe and
sound. The matter was not finally de
termined and the pastor, Father Diss.
adjourned the meeting to Thursday
night to Knights of Columbus hall
when positive action will be taken.
. The present building was erected in
the early days of the camp at the cor
ner of Central and St. Patrick street
and Bryan avenue. When the neces
sity arose for extending the dump at
the Wandering boy shaft the mining
company agreed to move the church
and pastor's residence to the present
site. In the process of removal the
old timbers were badly warped and
during severe windstorms the building
shakes In such a way that it Is not
deemed safe for continued occupancy.
