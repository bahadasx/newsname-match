Alpine, Texas, May 8. American troops are rushing
today through the barren and desolate Big Bend country
in pursuit of the Mexicans who raided towns in that ter
ritory last Friday night, killing three United States sol
diers and a boy and kidnaping two American citizens.
The raiders crossed the Brewster county line and invaded
American soil.
The section is white hot with rage today. Cattlemen,
ranchers and others are rallying to the hunt with ven
geance as their watchword. Fifteen cavalrymen dashed
from Alpine at the first news of the raid to aid the small
detachment which had arrived from a nearby post to aid
the stricken settlement.
The Mexican raid began at 10 o'clock Friday night. A
force estimated at between 150 and 300 Mexicans crept
up on the settlement. They avoided the American border
patrol by making a wide detour, forded rivers and crossed
the intervening stretch of territory in the night.
Nine men of the Fourteenth regiment were in Glenn
Springs to protect the settlement. Other men in the vil
lage were C. D. Wood, W. A. Ellis, J. A. Deemer and F.
Compton, Deemer's clerk.

mainder of the population.
When the attack began, the Americans retreated to a
hut, barricaded its doors and windows and began a des
perate fight against overwhelming odds. They were
routed when the Mexicans, despairing of approaching the
beleaguered Americans while they had " any ammunition
left, hurled fireballs upon the thatched rotof. Three men
fell as the little detachment fled from the blaze.
One was riddled with 10 bullets, the other two were
struck many times. Those who survived reached the
shelter of a rocky field and continued their battle until
daylight when the Mexicans, with triumphant yells, rode
away, carrying as captives J. A. Deemer and F. Compton
and leading pack horses loaded with loot.
No hope is felt here. for Deemer and
Coinpton. Knowiii" thp character of the
raiders residents of the district are prc
pnrod for tlio worst. The Mexican nt-
t-ick was centered against the Amer
ican soldiers. When the surviving troop
ers, most of them severely wounded, es
caped to the hills in the rear of the set
tlement, the raiders turned their atten
tion to the village store. At dawn, thp

Driven from their first stand, the sol

the conflict raged for three hours with

Provisional President Carranza today

further suggested thar n readjustment

GERMANY'S PLEDGES ARE
ACCEPTED BY PRESIDENT
This However Applies Only to That Part of Reply WhieH
Covers Orders to Submarine Commanders, Rejecting
Everything Else-Position Is Taken That the United
States Is Dealing With England Without Any Reference
to Negotiations With Germany-Neither Can Tell It How
to Act Towards Other
By Robert J. Bender '
(United Press Staff Correspondent.) .
Washington, May 8 President Wilson will not move
to bring European peace at this time. The veiled sugges
tion that he do so in the German note was not heeded at
the White House. It was learned on high authority that,
acting on the advice of the American embassies in London
and Paris, the administration will not make any peace
proposals until the promised great offensive of the allies
has been launched.
This reply may be en route to Berlin even now. Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing conferred last night
with regard to its contents: The fact that it will not be
made public until this afternoon was believed due to a
desire to allow the note time to reach Germany.
The communication will be a formal acknowledgement
f the receipt of the German reply, and it will indicate, it
is declared, that this government, accepting the new
pledges, considers itself in no way bound to the condi
tions of the answer. '
The president is known to take the position that the
United States is dealing with Germany apart from its
negotiations with Great Britain and that it will continue
to deal with Great Britain without any reference to its
negotiations with Germany.
It may be stated on the highest authority that the
American message may be summed up briefly as accept
ance of that part of the German reply which covers orders
to submarine commanders and rejection of everything
else.
The answer will eliininnto the possi
bility of a break on any episode which
had happened in the past. Future
friendly relations depend on German ad
herence to the new orders issued to sub
marine commnndcrs.
It was learned that tho statement of
Carl W. Ackermnn, Cnited Press Btnff
correspondent in Berlin, that the time
was opportune for another trip of Col
onel House to Europe in the interests of
pence occasioned no surprise at the
White House. It is no secret Hint Ger

ton that President Wilson would accept
the concessions made in the German re

caused the greatest satisfaction here to
day. The public believes that the German-American
controversy is definitely
closed.
Newspapers nre discussing the pos
sibility of President Wilson being ac
ceptable to Germany as mediator when
the time to consider pence terms comes.
Certain papers in vei.r ffunrded phrases
pointed out that the ponce reference in

"The note contains a passage of tho

from one belligerent must be in such
form thnt this government will have

Tho general feeling among adminis
tration members was that peace without
tho fighting of another winter cam
paign was possible and even probable,
but thnt the first move would be a
matter of months rather than weeks. It
was hoped that pence suggestions might
take definite form before snow falls,
but that depends on the success of a
allied offensive or on Germany's back
down from its present position.
