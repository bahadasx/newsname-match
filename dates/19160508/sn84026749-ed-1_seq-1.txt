A brief note, terse and to the point
wilt Inform the German government:
That the United States accepts the

demand that Germany declare an
abandonment of the lawless methods
of submarine warfare against mer

That the United States looks to the

That the United States observes with"
surprise that Germany again Insist
on suggesting the course which this

It Is declared that the President wll
not avail himself or the peace sug
gestions thrown out In the German
note, or of the message received from
Pope Benedict, to renew offers of medi

Official Washington Is awaiting with
Interest the effect which the American
note will have on Germany, If, as is
suspected In some quarter. Germany's
compliance Is actually conditioned upon
action by this Government towards
British violations of International law.
It Is believed that the note will have
the result of "smoking out" Ger

her submarine warfare unlcs s the
United States presses Its case against
Great Britain, or the German admiralty

confidently predicted that there will "be
a severance of diplomatic relations.
Hegardlng the peace prospects. Presi
dent Wilson Is said to feol that he
'would not be justified In renewing any
offers of mediation so long as the re
lations between the -United Btates and
Germany are unsettled, and until the
other belligerents signify a willingness
to hear such proposals.
German Public Thinks
Controversy Is Closed
BERLIN, May 8. Direct word from
Washington that President Wilson
will accept Germany's submarine
concessions has caused the greatest
satisfaction here. The public now
' believes the Gernan-Amerlcan con
troversy densely closed,
The newspapers arc now discuss-
Inr the possibility that President
W(Ison may provo acceptable to Ger
many as a peace mediator when the
time comes to ond the world wor.
Certain of the papers, commenting
guardedly, point out that the pe.ace
jeference In Germany's reply affords
the American executive an oppor
tunity to make a definite more for
peack.
"The German note contains one
pissage which we consider of the
utmost Importance.' said the Vor
waerts, "narroly. the reference to
the fact that Geimany has twice,
within recent months declared Its
readiness for a peace which would
secure Its vltnl Interests."
In conservative papers In the last
few days the opinion has been ex
pressed that behind the action of the
American Government there was
hidden an Intention to step forward
as a peace mediator. Perhaps this
passnire In the German note will
give Mr Wilson an occasion to mtke
public tjte terms of peace whlnh ho
believes possible, they say.
"President Wilson can perhaps do
more than merely maintain seace
between Oermanv and the United
States,' said the National Liberal Go.
xettc. Tate has thrown much unheard-of
power In this man' lap
that he could do still other things
for bleeding Buffeting humanity.
Our answer shows him the wey."
The majority of tho German papers
do not emphasise the peace reference

A strong, manly young Italian, a dif

shoulders, each clasping a hand of a
child, paused before the door of the
Baby Welfare Exhibit at Fifteenth and

"How much!" asked the man.
"Nothing at all," replied one of the

Distrustful, and Inquiring whether
"everything Is really free," the couple
and their child went In.
They were only one group, among the
hundreds who, despite the circus, de

Declaring that charges made against
Louis D. Brandels have proceeded from

he refused to be serviceable to them
in the promotion of their own selfish
Interests." President Wilson hss writ

Retake Trenches in Series of
Fierce .Night Combats, War
Office Says.
TAIUS. May 8 French troops have
recaptured a large part of the ground
104t on both banks of the Meuse.yester
day, when the Germans made a most
violent attack, believed by French mili
tary critics to signal a fourth great at
tack on Verdun.
A successful French counter-attack
last night drove the Oermans from the
ccmmuntcatlng trench they had occu
pied In yesterday's heavy battling east
of Hill SH. on the northwestern front
of Verdun.
In a series of night combats the
ITronrh Ihnw the Qermiiu out of the
greatest part of the M0 yards of flrst-
Une trenches they occupiea oeiween
Haudromont wood and Fort Douau
mont. the war office announced today.
Heavy Force In Attack.
It Is now confirmed that the Sunday
attack on the east bank of the Meuse
was made by large German forces on
a front of about one and one-quarter
miles. The Germans attempted to
break through the French lines be
tween Haudromont wood and Fort
Douaumont, but despite heavy sacri
fices in men, penetrated only a 600
yard sector of the first line trenches.
With the grenndes and bayonets, the
French last night attacked this sector.
Before the Germans could organise
their defenses, they had been driven
out of nearly the entire E00 yards,
the French taking thirty-two pris
oners. Battle All Night.
A violent battle continued through
out last night on the west bank ot the
Meuse, northwest of Verdun, and was
still In progress early today. Hill 304
waa the center of the most desperate
struggles, the French resisting most
stubbornly and checking repeated en
omy advances.
In recapturing the underground
communicating trench taken by the
Germans yesterday east of Hill 304,
the French captured fifty, prisoners.
The Germans suffered heavy losses In
last night's fighting.
Two German aeroplanes were
brought down by French flyers In the

School Board Wins
Suit From Teacher
Court Dismisses Mandamus Ac
tion Brought By Former Princi
pal of Armstrong.
The mandamus action brought by
Wilson Bruce Evans against the Board
ot Education to reinstate him as princi
pal of Armstrong Manual Training
School and director ot colored night
schools was dismissed today by Justice
titatiord.
The court held It 'has no authority
to act aS a court of appeals from a de
cision of the board." and "the board,
having reached the decision In gooo
faith-. Its action, even If mistaken, can
not be overruled. '
Evans sued the Board of Education to
reinstate him. on the grounds that he
was dismissed without a hearing and
that the procedure of the board was not
lawful.
Justice Stafford's opinion holds that
"the board removed him on the ground
or Inefficiency, and It Is admitted by the
plaintiff that If that was the real
grounds upon which tho board acted It
was acting within Its authority and not
required to give him any opportunity to
be heard."
Evans alleged the board acted In bad
faith bv "falsely asserting Inefficiency
ns a means of avoiding a trial upon tho
real cause."
Justice Stafford held that "the evi
dence does not satisfy 'the court that
the charce of the plaintiff Is true."

raiders. General oott- and War Mia
fsterObregon will meet today as sched

ment to solve the Mexican situation.
Ubregon presented Carranza's annrov
al Sunday, and arrangements were
made for the final conference today.
Unofficial but dennlte statements from
authentic sources said there waa little
likelihood of a break In the Internation
al plan because of the Glenn Springs
outrage. Officials regard the raid as
an Incident of the Mexican situation
ana noi as a dominating ractor.
Scott and Funston Rage.
Scott and General Funston raged
whey news of the raid was received
here, while Mexican officials were vis!
bly worried or frankly scared. Funs
ton got busy at once, sending two
troops of the Fourteenth Cavalry from
Port Clark to Marathon and two troopa
of the Eighth Cavalry from El Paso,
under Major Langhorne, bound for the
same concentration point. A perma
nent campaign is contemplated, accord
lng to indications here. The forces
leaving El Paso carried water wagns.
Indicating a hard drive across the
desert Is contentplated.
Marathon, eighty-five miles from the
border, already has become the second
military base, but If the Mexicans have
moved across the border again, as seems
likely today, the operations may not be
on a large scale from that point.
Mexican officials today stated the El
Paso agreement provides that each na
tion may send troops 100 miles across
the border after bandits in case of
raids. This was urged as one reason
for speedy signing of the agreement to
day despite the fact that a second
American expedition is on Its way to
Invade Mexico.
Refuse To Alter Plan.
Though Carranza assentod to the plan,
his approval was contingent upon minor
changes suggested In dispatches from
the Mexican capital. Scott and Funston
refused flatly to make any alterations,
pointing out that Obregon, armed with
diplomatic authority, had approved the
entire plan during the second confer
ence. The balance of their two-hour con
ference yesterday was given over to
discussion of the Glenn Springs raid,
Obregon detailed measures Carrama Is

un the little settlement They
avoided tho border patrol' by a wldo
detour, forded the R,Jo Grande and
crossed ihe intervening pandy
stretch at night.
Thero were nine men of the Four
teenth Cavalry stationed at Glean
springs to protect the ?etJement.
Others In the village were C. D.
Wood and W. K. B1U& owners of a
wax factory, with their families; J.
Deemer, owner of a general store,
and F. Compton, employed as De.ein
erja clerk.
Tlio wax factory represents the
town's only Industry and the store Is
the only trading poit In a radius of
many tntles, A few Mexican fam
lles compose the remainder of tho
tllage. The nearest city lieu eighty
Ave miles away anJ the village Is
far removed from railroad cqnjmu
nlction. Soldiers Retreat To Hut.
Retreating to an adobe hut after firing
a few shots with revolvers, the Ameri
cans barricaded the doors and began a
five-hour fight against tremendous odds.
In the end, they wero routed by fire,
when the Mexicans, despairing of ap
proaching the hut while the Americana
had any ammunition left, hurled Are
balls on tho thatched roof.
Three men fell as the detachment fled
at last from the biasing hut. One waa
riddled with ten bullets; the other two
were struck many limes.
The remainder, Including some wound

yells, mounted their horses and rode

and Compton, and leading pack horses
loadcil with loot.
No hopo was held out for Deemer and
Compton today. Knowing the character
of the Mexican raiders, through fre

hear tho worst regarding the fate of the
two frontiersmen.
Compton's son, a mute, was slain In
tho first few minutes of the raid, sup
posedly because tho Mexicans thought
the child was concealing information.
Bandits Loot Store.
The attack centered on the soldier.
When the surviving troopers, most of
them badly wounded, escaped to the
hills back of the town and lodged them
selves behind sheltering rocks, the Mexi
cans turned their attention to the vil

building, as tho loot was carried Into the
open and strapped to the pack horses.
Then at dawn the bulldlhg burst Into
flames. A residence soon followed, and
In n few minutes tho country was light
ed by the flames of the burning settle

houeted against tho light, and stains
on the sand lalor convinced the Ameri
cans that some of their bullets had
found their mams.
