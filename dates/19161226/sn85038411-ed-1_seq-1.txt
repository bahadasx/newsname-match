Drders Piled High on Desks
Will Keep Plants Running
For Months
Ten to forty per eent. increases in
output, wage increases in a number
of instances ranging from ten to thir
ty per cent., completion of big im
provements and new plants and con
tinued operation during the entire year
are the reports ojcials in practically
all the industrial interests in Harris
burg and vicinity give as they declare
that the year 1916 has been unequalled
In production and has been a record
one for the city.
Many of the managers and officials
say from present indications, 191"
will prove another record breaker
with ten to forty per cent, increases in
output over the record of the year just
closing.
The hum and throb of machinery in
practically every plant has not stopped
once during the year, and will con
tinue indefinitely, it is believed. Or
ders in some instances which will not
be delivered for the next six months
are lying on desks in the offices of
many of the plants. Prosperity every
where is in evidence, millions of dol
lars have been paid out, and millions
received for the goods manufactured,
from baby shoes to big shells for for
eign governments, to be used in the
European war.
Never before in the history of Har
risburg has the record been equaled,

Car Runs Away When
Motorman Slips to Road
While Stamping Out Fire
Fire in a Camp Hill car of the i
Valley Railways this morning caused I
a bit of excitement and might have i
resulted in serious injuries to the' pas
sengers but for the foot work of the
motorman.
A short circuit started the blaze on
the front platform and when the mo- |
torman, J. C. St oner, attempted to ,
stamp it out he slipped from the plat- i
form to the road. Without a motor- 1
man to throw on the brakes the car J
began to run away. When Stoner saw I
that the car was heading toward the j
down grade of a big hill he sprinted !
alongside and yelled to the conductor ,
to pull oft the trolley and throw on the
brakes. The car was stopped just in j
time to prevent a possibly serious !
accident.
WOMAN' KNOCKED DOWN
Mrs. . C. Llddich, 1009 North l
Seventh street, was injured about the !
head this morning when knocked j
down in a runaway accident. A horse '
hitched to a Standard Raking Com-'
pany wagon, was frightened when an I
engine blew off steam and run up !
Seventh street. An automobile be-!
longing to Vandel Maheck, hutcher, |
at 532 South Cameron street, was
standing near Forster street. The!
runaway team crashed into the auto- :
mobile, knocking down Mrs. Liddick,
who was purchaing meat at the rear
of the auto. The wagon was badly
damaged, and the front axle of the !
automobile bent. In the crash the
horse became entangled in the lines
and was stopped.
