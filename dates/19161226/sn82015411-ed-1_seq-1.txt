THE CANTATA AT
THE LIHUE CHURCH
The "Nativity of Christ ' cantata,
on Sunday evening, at the Lihuo
Union church, was, perhaps, the
most ambitious musical event ever
presented in hihuc and was a great
success. The full chorus of fourteen
selected and trained voices gave
power and volume, yet with careful
modulation and expression that
was most effective. Tnc solos inter
spersed through the cantata were a
very charming feature of it, and
, werrtftely rendered by Mrs. II. T.
Sheldon, Mrs. K. C. Ahana, and
Miss M Wood, sopranos; Mr. W.
N. Stewart and Mr. A. (. Kaulu
kou, tenors: and Mr. 15. W. Car
den, bass. Mrs. W. II. Grote han
dled the organ with skill and preci
sion. The initiative and executive
behind the whole affair was Mrs: J .
M. Lydgate.
The musical part of the service
was preceded by scripture recitations
of the Christmas story, largely in
concert, by the Sunday School chil
dren, which were very well tione.
The church was a bcautifiul sym
phony in red, of shaded lights and
potted red flowers, with a fine Nor
folk Island Christmas trce of gener
ous proportions, suitably decorated
for the occasion.
The collection amounted to 8GS.20
which will go toward macadamizing
the entrance roadway, a much need
ed improvement.

The Christmas Mail
On account of heavy seas the
steamers leaving Nawiliwili Friday
afternoon did not take the mail.
All of tho Chrismas letters and pre
sents intonded for Honolulu wen
left on tho dock here, and did not
get away until Saturday night On
account of tho fact that both Sun
day and Christmas are postollieo
holidays, in Honolulu President
Patterson, of the Kauai Chamber
of Commerce, appealed to tho city
postmaster to have the mail from
Kauai delivered on Sunday, and al
so asked the good oilices of tho Ho
I noiuiu unanmor oi uonuneieo in
the matter. Tho result was a wire
less from Secretary Brown, of the
Honolulu Chamber of Commerce,
on Sunday stating that tho Christ
mas mail from Kauai would be dis
tributed by carriers that day.

DAMAGE
THE WAIMEA SIDE
The rainstorm of last week was-
piobably not heaviest on the Ilana
lei side of the island, as was at first
supposed, after all. Whimea valley
appears to have gotten the worst of
it, and the happenings there arc of
interest. For instance:
A Japanese named Miyake lives
(or lived) about three miles' from
Waiinoa, up tho valley. When the
flood came down from tho moun
tains lie realized that his place was
in danger. Taking two of his chil
dren in his arms and a third cling
ing to his neck, ho waded to higher
ground, tho water being almost up
to his waist. Shortly afterward tho
forsaken house was lifted by the
flood and carried down tho river.
About a mile up the valley the
louse of one Ogata was carried from
its foundation and lodged in a giove
of orange trees.
Several Japanese lost their crops
of vegetables, their gardens being
buried as much as two feet under
sand washed down from the high
ands.
The Japanese store at the junction
of Waimea river and Makawcli
stream was several feet in water,
while water rose six inches in the
parlor of T. Blackstad.
Although tho mouth of Waimea
rivor was open, so great was tnc
flood from the hills that tho water
rose over the retaining wall recent-
y constructed and submerged the
streets of tho town up to tho higher
levels at and beyond tho premises
of the Waimea Wine Company. It
is the opinion that had the mouth
of tile river not have been open the
whole town would have been wash
ed out.
Tho rain was general all over Ka
uai, but appears to have been heavi
est toward tho mountains.
RACES AND POLO
NEW YEAR'S DAY
There will be great doings at Wai-
pouli race track next Monday, Jan

horse races and a big polo match
The races will begin at 10 o'clock
in the morning, and the polo match
will take place at 2:30 in tho after
noon. The latter will he between
tho Oahus and the Kauai team.
(Senator Rico says t lie odds are on
tho Kauai team, but admits that he
is just a little prejudiced in the mat
ter.) It will be a great day of sport
and undoubtedly a large crowd will
be present from all parts of the is
land. The Honolulu polo team will con

Arthur Rice and Charlie Lucas.

PARK IDEA A JOKE.
Tho Honolulu Advertiser of last
Tuesday contained the following,
alleged to be the opinions of Land
Commissioner Rivenburgh concern
ing the proposed summer wimp
plans for Waimea Canyon.
Hawaii has no more need , for a
camping park on Kauai, on the up
per Waimea ranges, than a monkey
has for two tails, according to Ber
tram G Rivenburgh, land commis
sioner, who, in company with Hy
drographer G. K. Larrison and
Superintendent of Forestry Judd,
made a visit last week to the site of
tho proposed park, returning Sun
day. Tho land is now, Mr. Rivenburgh
says, an arbitraiy forest leseivo,
having been set aside as such by
Senator Knudsen, of tho Garden
Island. It is in a wHd and practi
cally inaccessible country. The land
is now held under leasehold, but
part of it will revert to the Terri
tory next year, and tho remainder
the year following.
When the land reverts to the Ter
ritory, it will form, part of a forest
reserve, Mr. Rivenburgh says. In
fact, it is now practically such a re
serve. It was set aside as such by
the Knudsens, and no other use is
being made of it.
Therefore, says Rivenburgh, there
is no necessity for sotting it aside as
a nark. If Kauai people or people
from Honolulu or other parts of the
Territory, want to camp on the
land, all they have to do is to get
permission from the forestry board,
which will l)e a mere formality.
There is now no good road to the
land, says Rivenburgh. The Knud
sens have maintained a srt of trail,
but each winter this is washed out.
However, says tho land commission
er, if tho people want to go 911 the
land and camp, there can be no
particular objection. It is nothing
the land department lias anything
to do with.
Rivenburgh said yesterday that if

Washington Switzerland joined hands with the United States on
Fridav and sent a note to the European powers announcing her sup
port of the efforts of President Wilson to secure peace. "We would
consider ourselves most fortunate," Switzerland modestly savs, "if
we could aid in bringing about peace. The step taken by President
Wilson, of the Uniied States, has found a mighty echo in the hearts of
the people ot Switzerland where day after day we are forced to listen
to the moans of suffering Europe."
Thi note was received by the beliggerents on Saturday. France
and Great Britain were hardly less antagonistic to the Swiss move
than to the note of Wilson. Some of the. French iournals say that the
Swiss support of Wilson's proposals should "be received with courte
ous attention." One and all of the papers, however, repeat the
determination to continue the war until the Allies are completely vie
torious.
The Republican Wrangle
There is a marked agitation in the ranks of the Republican
partv in the lower lmue. Gardner, of Massachusetts, announced
last night that he would call for a conference with a view to out
lining a policy, which would likely follow the old lines, but would
probably fall flat in the Senate. The Republicans are also having
trouble over minority leadership.
Torreon Falls To Villa
The renort that the city of Torreon had been captured by Villa
has been confirmed. The Carranza forces were driven out, hut fur
