signed ah order creating the Polish
state credit bank, which shortly will 1s
^ue new paper currency in Polish
marks of a value equivalent to German
marks and guaranteed by the German
government
The step waB taken after long delib
eration on the problem as to,how the
financial and credit situation in Poland
could be improved with a view to stim
ulating the development of the Eco
nomic life of that country.
The bank, which will operate (for the
duration of the war and until Poland
is on a peace footing, will be opened as
soon a# the^currency can be prepared.
Its operation will be extended to the
portion of Polahd occupied by Austria
Hungary as soon as an agreement with
the dual monarchy to that effect is

Allied.Ships Off U. S. Coast.
Boston, Dec. 26.—The presence on
this side of the Atlantic of a formidable
fleet of allied warships was indicated
definitely today. The vessels are known
offleiiilly as commerce protectors.
They are heavily armed" and dis
guised. For obvious reasons their exact
disposition-is not revealed,'but the ar
rival recently in American^ waters of
the newest uniy-of the British and
French admiralties was made known
from a sourc& that hardly can be mis
taken.
For some days skippers of Reamers
have brought to New England ports
news of the appearance of strange
crafts that were making their way
westward. They made no reply to sig
nals and couid not be apprpached. It
is said that the fleet safely arrived
at Halifax, N. S., a few days ago, but
nothing then becaipe known generally
about Jt, because of the arict censorship
maintained.
The commerce protectors are de
scribed as large and powerful but cap
able of flair speedi They wereNdesigned,
it was said, to meet the German U-boat
danger and In anticipation of an at
tempted raid off the Canadian cosStr
similar to that of the U-5.3 recently.
At that time shipping men figured
that there was not an allied warship
within 500 miles of the spot that Capt
Hans Rose deliberately selected in
which'to operate.

Washington, Dec. 26.—Unless Cren
eraKCaranaa Returns a favorable an
swer today to the last communication
made to his commissioners by the
American representatives a week ago
at Philadelphia, the negotiations will
come to an end.
The Mexican commissioners will
meet at New York today' and If Car
ranza has sent to them his answer it
is expected Luis Cabrera, chairman of
the Mexican delegation, will forward it
immediately to Secretary Lane, chair
man of the American section,
When the joint Mexican-American
commission reconvened at Philadel
phia, Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican
commissioner who had carried the
protocol signed at Atlantic City to
Queretaro for the ratiiication of Gen
eral Carranzi* submitted a counter,
proposal. It was in effect a rejection,
of the agreement entered Into by the
commissioners and the substitution of
another protocol that had been drafted
by the Mexican commissioners at the
direction of Carranza.
Couritor Proposal Rejected.
The Americana replied in a written
cemmunicatiiNi, Spying th&tvth-ey could,
not consider the"counte?,protocol and
insisting that the agreement already
made must elthe.r be ratified or defi
nitely repudiated. Some aspect of an
ultijpatum was given the communica
tion by thejhsistence .that an answer
would be expected by Dec. 26. It. was
not specifically stated that failure to'
ratify the agreejnent woud result in a
final break in negotiations, but an in
timation that therAmericans would not
continue the debases that already have
extended over three months was clearly
made.
Whether Carranza has ratified tlw
agreement is unknown by the Amer
ican commissioners or by the state de
partment. Mr. Cabrere was in Washing
ton yesterday to spend Christmas with
Ambassador Designate Arj-edondo and
returned to New York last night to'
meet with Commissioners Pan! and
Bonlllas. He did not communicate
with Secretary Lane while hero and at
the embassy it was said this morning
that when he left here no word as to
Carranza's action had been received.
Conferences Dependant on Reply.
If Caranza's action is communicated
to Secretary Lane today arrangements
for continuanqes of the conferences o(
the joint commission will be made un
less the character of the reply is such
as to make It evident that continued
debate on the subject is useless. In
that case a formal exchange of notes
by thee hairmen of the commissions
will probably mark the finish of the
work.
In the event that Carranza agrees
to ,the terms of the protocol it is ex
pected that the^sessions will be re
sumed one week from today, perhaps
in Washington, altho the Mexicans
have .expressed a desire that they
might be held in New York.
No Word From Carranza.
New york, Dec. 26.—The Mexican
members, of the joint commission had
received no word from General Carran
za up to 1:15 o'clock this afternoon, It
was stated here by Luis Cabrera.
Mr. Cabrera was in confownne thru
put the day with his associates, Com
missioners Pani and Bonillas. He de
scribed the meeting as one In which
they "discussed important matters," but
further than that he declined to say
anything concerning the Carranza re
ply. He said any statement concern
ing results of a conference tonight must
come from the commission as a whole.

El Paso, Tex.. Dec. 26.—Three hun
dred recruits for the regular army on
the border and in Mexico were quaran
tined in tents on the parade grounds

BANK CONNECTION ABROAD.
Bank of England to Become Corre
spondent of United States.
"Washington, Dec. 26.—The govern
ment yesterday took its first formal
step thru the federal reserve boarcf
looking to the establishment of finan
cial connections abroad thru which it
hopes to strengthen the position of the
United States as a world banker.and
to maintain the American dollar as the
standard of oxchange.
Under a section of the federal re
serve act the board authorized the ap
pointment of the Bank of England as a
foreign correspondent of the fedora!
reserve bank^of New York and an
nounced that"the, eleven other reserve
banks might participate in the agency
relations.!
Connections with other foreign gov
ernmental institutions such as the
Bank of France is foreshadowed, offi
cials say. by today's action. The Bank
of England is the first foreign corre
spondent whose appointment has been
authorized since -the operation of the
new financial system in this country.
In addition to being the first step by
the government toward going after
foreltm business it is undcrstiwd that
authorization of this appointment is a
part of general plans for establishing
financial connections that wiij
strengthen the United States as a
creditor nation in the commercial com
petition which probably will result
when
the war closes and to provide a
ready means to ofTset any tendency on
the part of foreign ^bankers to with
draw the huge supply of gold accumu
lated here during *he war.
The action marks a radical departure
from the previous financial policy of
the country, inasmuch as it plaees' the
government of the United states an*
Great Britain for the .first '(me In di
rect continual financial relationship.
