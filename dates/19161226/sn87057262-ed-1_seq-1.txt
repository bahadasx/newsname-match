Jtec. 26.—Germany today banded to

cording to wireless messages picked
up here. The revenue cutter AcuBh
net and steamship Savanah started to
h^r assistance early today.
Four vessels are now on their way
to aid the distressed Maryland: The
steamship Savanah, the cutter Acush
net from Boston, the cutter Seneca
from Newport and the cutter Mohawk,
which picked up the distress signals
at sea.
Wireless messages said the engin
rooms of the Maryland were rapidly
being flooded. There are two steam
ers in the maritime register under
the name of Maryland. One of these
is a British vessel of 3,962 tons, the
other an American vessel of 1,899 tons.
The latter departed December 23
leaving Philadelphia for Liverpool or
bonbon. This is the vessel believed
In distress.
The American ship Maryland is
owned by the New York, Philadelphia
and Norfolk railroad and when she
left port in Philadelphia on Saturday,
carried a cargo of oil, iron piped',
fibre, paper and miscellaneous mer
chandise. She last reported her posi
tion as seventy-flve miles eaBt of the
Five Fathom Bank lightship.
Because her wireless was weak, no
messages giving cause of distress
could be interpreted at wireless sta
tions here. The position reported,
however, latitude 39, longitude 67, is
in that region where allied shipping
was recently raided by the German
submarine IT-53.
The Maryland was built in Wyan
dotte, Mich., for lake trade. She car
ried a crew of twenty while engaged
in lake traffic.
No Word by Owners.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 26.—Crew,

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press

OBERAMMERGAU, Bavaria, Dec.
25.—(delayed)—"This is not God's
war it. is man's war. So long as there
are armies and so long as nations pre
pare, there will be war.
So spoke Anton I^ang, "Christus'" in
Oberammergau's world famous pas
sion play today—on the saddest yule
tide the little Bavarian village had
ever known. Of her 1,800 population
Oberammergau has given 350 to the
army. Including Alfred Bierling, the
Saint John of tne play, who is now an
artilleryman in the German army.
Through the United Press, Lang de
sired that greetings be sent to his
friends in America and that denial be
made that he has joined a machine
gun company.
"I have never been to the front,"
said this bearded man, whose face
most nearly resembles the features of
the Saviour.
"I am still alive. Please tell my
many American friends that for me."
And then Lang showed his visitors
a brfok, with the names of thousands of
friends signed therein. One signature
was that of the king of Rumania.
"Fifty of our people have fallen,"
Lang continued sadly. "How shall it
end? I see no end. I see another
spring of fighting, bloodier than ever.
And if neither side is defeated—then
more fighting, with millions bein» kill
ed and millions of others working so
other millions shall be killed, with
some of those millions becoming rich
in the war.
"I recall Christ's words—'who takest
the sword shall perish by the sword.'
That doesn't mean Europe shall perish
by the sword, but I Interpret the
phrase to mean that he who starts
war shall perish.
"I would be glad If there were no
militarism in any land. Shall olson
always be used to destroy roison?
Isn't there another method? Cannot
all militarism be destroyed by interna
tional agreements? Cannot America
take the first step?"
Lang was told how some of Ru
mania's soldiers said they did not be
lieve in God any more, because God
wouldn't permit such murder as the
great war has brought about.
