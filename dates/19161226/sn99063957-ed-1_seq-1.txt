MEETING OF
r.nncf tmfinnnla
Politicians See Long Period of
Friendly Relations of the
Two Countries .
Tokio, Dec. 8. (By mail.) Plans for
strengthening the new alliance between
Japan and Russia are believed here to
be behind the selection of Viscount
Yasuya Uchida, former ambassador to
the United States and as Japanese en
voy to Russia.
Viscount Uchida fills the post vacat
ed when Viscount Motone was recalled
from l'etrograd to become foreign min
ister in the new Terauehi ministry.
Politicians here accept the conclusion
of the Russo-Japanese pact last spring
as only the beginning of a long term of
friendly political and commercial rela
tions between the two countries. The
general 'belief is that Russia has re
quested Japan to wait until the close of
the war for signature of additional
clauses of the new convention.
Viscount Motone is given credit here
for having laid the foundation for the
new alliance and his service us foreign
minister is expected to develop pro-Russian
tendencies. Upon Viscount Uchida,
however, is placed the responsibility of
promoting relations in l'etrograd". so
that, after the war, the two nations will
be even more closely aligned in promot
ing their interests-in the far east.

With the French Armies iu Alsace-

-France's soldiers celebrated Christ

Especially was the conviction of

It was this conviction felt by cv

to exceptional efforts to render toduy's

Hundreds of regimental letter car

at great risk, under heavy shell lire, de
livering to the first line trenches all
Christmas packages. Opening of these
parcels was the only celebration pos
sible in the first line trenches.
But in the rent, the celebrations were
elaborate. There were Christinas tree
exercises at. all churches, where oper
atic singers, violinists nnd other musi
cians now serving in the army made up
programs of entertainment.
I attended one of the celebrations iu
a Protestant church where the audience
was made up of soldiers from tho

German efforts to fruternalizc were
discouraged by grenades and trench
mortals. On one occasion the Saxons,
in an opposite trench, lifted up over
Iheif parapet a Christmas tree and as
the Tommies facing it remarked "we
hung oranges, apples a nil bonbons on
it." Or in other words, they deluged it
with grenades. It was observable that
the experiment was not repoatocd.

Packages Prom Home.
In the front trenches the fighters, be

For the most put these were trinkets
made by mothers, sweethearts or wives.
But for the Tommies Who had nono of

Wireless Says Engine Room
Flooded-Is About 150
Miles from Sandy Hook
New York, Dec. 26. The steamship
Maryland is reported sinking about 150
miloB off Handy Hook, according to
wireleBS messages picked up here.
Four vessels are now on their way to
aid her. The steamship Bavannah, the
cutter Achusnet from Boston, the cut
ter Hencca from Newport and the cut
ter Mohawk, which picked up the dis
tress signals at sea.
Wireless messages said the engine
rooms of the Maryland were rayidly be
ing flooded.
There are two steamships in the mari
time register named Maryland. Ono of
these is a British vessel of 2,062 tons
and the other is an Amorican vessel of
1,H!9 tons. The latter was last reported
on December 23, leaving Philadelphia
for Liverpool or London. This is be
lieved to be the ship in distress.
Tho American ship Maryland is own
ed by the New York, Philadelphia &
Norfolk rnilroad and when she loft port
in Philadelphia on Saturday she carried
a cargo of oil, iron pipe, fiber, paper
and miscellaneous merchandise. She lust
reported her position as 75 miles cast of
the Five Fathom bank lightship.
Because her wireless was weak no
messages giving cause of distress could
bo interpreted nt wireless stations here.
The position reported, however, latitude
.'III, longitude 67, is in that region where
allied shipping was recently raided by
tho German submarine U-53.
The Maryland was built in Wyan
dotte, Mich., for lake trade. She car
ried a crew of 20 while engaged in lake
traffic.

locating the Maryland is expected un
less she can inform the rescuers of her
whereabouts by wireless, according to

London, Dec. 26. Knglish hostility
toward President Wilson appeared to
havo been considerably modified today.
The change was attributed to the latest
interpretations of the motives which iiu-
jpelled dispatch of the. American peace
note. London now regards it as having
been sent with the main pnrpose of forc
ing Germany to state her peace terms
and to carry the implication that unless
these terms are "satisfactory" Amer
ica may enter the war on the side of the
allies. There was, however, considerable
continued criticism of what was termed
the president's obscurity and "infelic
ity" of language nnd his apparent re
versal of principles since May 27, when
he stated that America was not con
cerned with tho causes and objects of
the war.
The declaration in the Swiss state
ment that the Swiss government was
"in touch" with President Wilson five
weeks ago was regarded ns conclusively
disproving the almost universal Initial
belief that the American proffer was
a mere appendix to the German peaee
note.

President Wilson's peace plea forward
ed hero today. No official confirma
tion was to be obtained. The report,
however, went so far as to suggest that
the A. B. C. (Argentine, Brazil and
Chile) governments wero mainly con
cerned in the move.
Houth America has generally applaud
ed the timeliness of President Wilson's
peace suggestions and saw in Secretary
Lansing's hirrts of America joining a
league of nations afer tho war to force
peace, inn opportunity for a closer Paa
Ajnericanism. Lansing suggested that
the Unitod States would first of nil,
