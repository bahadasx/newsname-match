Towl, former mayor of this city, was
found not guilty of a charge of ac
cepting a bribe of $10 from P. L.

Commercial hotel on Dec. 6, when
Fullerton accused Towl of having
given the key to the "blindpig" to
the authorities sto they could raid

At the time of the conference it

concealed in a closet adjoining the

both, Towl did not deny having re
