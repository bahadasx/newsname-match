THEIRtNCHES
On Western Front Men Feast While
Big Guns Keep Up Their Boom
MACKENSEN FLAYS RUMANIANS
German Field Marshal Gives Newest
Allies No Chance to Be
Merry.
The third Christmas of the Euro
pean war passed without much fight
ing on the British and French fronts,
where virtually only the artillery was
active and the men were feasted and
entertained as far as was compatible
with the sterner business of war.
Rumania's first Christmas as a par
ticipant in the war witnessed heavy
fighting on the Rumanian front.
Ground was yielded by the Rumanians
at some points under the pressure of
the Germans end north of the Buzeu
Rimnlk road a height was lost by the
Russians.
In the northwest corner of Dobrudja
province, the sector to which the
Russo-Rumanlaa retreat has taken
them, and army of Field Marshal von
Mackensen has begun to attack the
bridgehead of Matchln, after Isakls
he, on the eastern bank of the Dan
ube, was captured. In addition to
announcing the evacuation of Isalshe
Hie Russians admit the occupation 01
Tultcha.
British mounted troops, with the
co-operation of aircraft, carried a
strong position at Maghdaba, 20 miles
distant from El Arish. which was cap
tured on Thursday. Incomplete re
ports, says the statement from Lon
don, show that 1130 prisoners were
captured and a large quantity of
arms and war material taken. Heavy
casualties were suffered by the Turks.
The Russians claim to have Inflict
ed heavy losses on the Austro-Ger
mans when the latter attempted to
recapture bights occupied by the
Russians on Sunday in the wooded
Carpathians.
Macedonia except for artillery
struggle. Is void of momentous actlvl
ty. The same Is true generally of the
Austro-Itallan theatre, except for the
Julian front, where even such opera
tlons have been prevented by mist.
Two British destroyers have beer,
sunk In a collision in the North sea
Fifty-five officers and men were lost
WOULD CALL. ALL CANADIANS
Sir Sam Hughes Advocates More
Vigorous Policy.
As a recruiting policy for Canada
Sir Sam Hughes, former minister o!
militia In the Canadian cabinet, In ar
address at Lindsay, Out, yesterdaj
advocated the Immediate calling ou'.
cf all single men between the ages of
38 and 45, not now exempted unde
the law for active service training un
der the Canadian militia act. He
declared that the national service
commission was more or less of c
failure and that It would be a yea
before the commission could begin to
operate with any effect. Prompt ac
tlon is needed, Sir Sam said, and the
calling out of the single men couU"
be done under the provisions of tlu
act In order, however, to remove
all doubt regarding compulsory serv
ice for overseas, he said, the act
should be amended so that the milltu
could bo sent abroad for the defense
of the empire. Under this plan, Sii
Sam asserted, he would undertake tc
have at least from 200,000 to 300,00(
men ready for the front within foui
months.
The former minister of militia
praised the work of the Canadians at
the front and stated that he hac"
found the British government and tlu
war office fully in accord with his
policy of making promotions, as far as
possible, from the ranks on the bash
of merit and efficiency.
RAID BY CANADIANS
German Trenches North of Arras
Cleaned Out by Daring Exploit.
North of Arras certain Canadian
troops have Just accomplished what
the British officers declare marks a
new phase In modern trench warfare
nays an Associated Press correspon
dent with the British armies in
France. In a raid, which, however,
was much more than a raid, they sue
ceoded in putting out of actiou, tem
porarily at least, an entire battalion
of German Infantry. They took 59
prisoners, including one commission
ed Officer and estimated that they
"killed 150 Germans In dugouts which
were blown to atoms after their oc
cupants refused to surrender. The
Canadian losses were extremely light
The "raid" took place at 3 o'clock
In the afternoon on & front of 400
yards. The German prisoners admit
that they were taken completely by
surprise. The officer captured said he
was convinced that something was
about to happen, but believed that
the attack was coming on Christmas
eve. He reported to the higher com
mand, but received no support.
CONFERENCE OE
BELLIGERENTS
Reply to President Wilson's Peace
Note Delivered today
CHOICE OF ROAD LEFT OPEN
Advises That Immediate Meeting of
Delegates Be Held on Neutral
Ground.
Berlin, Dec. 26. Germany's reply
to President Wilson's peace note was
handed today to Ambassador Gerard
to be forwarded to Washington. It
proposes a meeting of delegates of
the belligerents na'tions to be held
at some neutral place named by the
president. The president, "the note
says," points out that which he has in
his heart and leaves open the choice
of the road. To the Imperial govern
ment an immediate exchange of views
seems the most appropriate in order
to secure desired results. It there
fore begs, in view of the declaration
of December 12, which offers Its hand
for peace negotiations, to propose an
immediate meeting of delegates at
some neutral place."
PEACE EFFORTS INDORSED
President Wilson Has Many Cable
grams from Europe.
A large number of cablegrams from
people and organizations in Holland,
Switzerland and the Scandinavian
ountries were received at the White
House yesterday, indorsing President
Wilson' recent note to the belliger
ent nations. In connection with the
Swiss government's formal noto to
the belligerents published yesterday
pledging support to the president's ef
forts toward peace, the cablegrams
were read with deep interest.
MORE PEACE PROPOSALS
They Are Coming From Scandinavia
and Holland.
The overseas new agency gives
out at Berlin the following regarding
peace reports: "The Heme (Switzer
land' Tageblatt reports that the
Scandinavian governments, according
to rumor, will In the immediate tu
foster peace negotiations by com-
eon propositions. Likewise the Neue
Zuricher Zeitung reports from The
Hague that Holland will probably is
ue a note similar to that of Switzer
land."
SHERIFF PUTS OUT A FIRE
He Also "Puts Out" an Obstreperous
Negro Prisoner.
About 5 o'clock Christmas morning
Sheriff Frederick Godfrey noticed
hat the county building was rapidly
"lling with smoke. In the darkness
'he sheriff began searching for the
riffin of the smudge anj eventually
ound It In the cell occupied by the
big negro lumberjack, Calvin Wil-
iams, who has been indicted for as
sault and who Is awaiting trial
vhen county court resumes Its ses-
ilon next month.
Williams has been giving the slier-
ff considerable trouble since he was
ocked up hero last fall. He made an
Utempt to escape some weeks ago
and was knocked out by the sheriff's
wife who used a big padlock to sulv
due the prisoner. Williams' Christ
mas morning diversion was to set fire
o his bedding, presumable in the
hope that enough disturbance would
'je created to enable him to escape.
Attaching a garden hose to the fau
cet in the jail kitchen, the sheriff pro
ceeded to extinguish the fire. He al-
o extinguished Williams. In order
to make sure that not a spark of tire
was left in the cell, the sheriff kept
the hoso going until the negro's teeth
attled like a dancing gypsey girl's
castanets. Since his impromptu bath
Williams' manner has been much more
ubdued.

MILK PRICE
ISPtniEocy
Meeting Called at Manchester
Depot r ext Saturday
CLOSE UNION OF PRODUCERS
Effort Under Way to Hold Meeting
To Organize Every County in
New England States
All the milk producers of Benning
ton county are requested to meet in
Odd Fellows hall at Manchester
Depot next Saturday morning, Dec. 30
at 10 o clock to organize to secure
better prices and better selling con
ditious. The principal speaker will
be John K. Mills of Xorthboro, Mass.
On the same day similar meetings
are to held In every county in New
England. The Now England Milk
Producers association has sent out
notices from which the following
paragraphs are taken:
"To enable all New England dairy
men to organize in a single day!
"Such is the master stroke planned
by the directors, otlleers and mem
bers of the great New England milk
producers' association, co-operating
with the officers of county farmers'
associations, county advisers, grang
es, fair officials and editors of the
ccunty local press.
"Richard Pattee, secretary N E M
P A, has Issued a call for every cow
owning farmer in each county in each
state of ail New England, to meet at
the comity seat next week Saturday,
December 30, at 10 a. ni. An organiz
er or representative will be present
at each of these county meetings to
tell all about the N E M P A. what it
has done, what it aims to do, what it
can do if every milk producer In New
England join with it.
"The idea Is better prices for bet
ter milk, cooperative purchase of sup
plies, associated selling. N E M-P A
projxwes that the brand "Made in
New England," applied to dairy pro
ducts, shall become so well and favor
ably known to New England consum
ers that every pound of milk and
cream, butter and cheese, consumed
by the millions of consumers in New
England shall be produced In New
England. It is believed that this plan
may double the amount of money paid
to New England farmers for dairy
products, eventually. It may do more
for agriculture, for the upbuilding and
for the prosperity of rural New Eng
land than any other one thing.
"No group of American farmers
ever attempted such a sweeping
movement for organization. These
county meetings on December 30 will
be followed up closely by a trained
corps of organizers, let every milk
producer do all ho can to keep push
ing forward this worthy New England
wide movement.
"Each county meeting next week
Saturday, December 30. beginning at
10 a. m., will have one or tnoro
speakers from abroad. It will be un
der the combined auspices of the ag
ricultural leadership of tho county.
It will be provided with full suggest
ions as to just what to do and how to
do it, provided the farmers present
approve. One plan is that every
township cr milk-shipping section,
which Is represented by five or more
farmers at this county seat meeting
next Saturday, may complete on the
spot tho temporary organization of
their local union of tho N E M P A.

SPORTING NOTES
Paragraph News Concerning Profes
sional and Amateur.
If anybody thinks Johnny Evers is
all in as a major-league player they
should listen to his ambition, expres
sed last week. It is to play ball long
enough to be the oldest player in
point of service in tho National Lea
gue. Tliat record is now held by
Hans Wagner of Pittsburg, who is tho
only active player In the National
league who was performing when
Evers Joined the Cubs in 1902. As
Wagner started with Louisville in
1897 that means that all the players
between that season and 1902 have
come and gone. The Trojan can
hardly count 11)02 as a season In the
big show because he did not join the
Cubs until Labor Day of that year, so
that he has actually completed four
teen years In the National League.
Now If he intends to go after Wag
ner's record he will have to stay up
for nix more seasons, but he can gain
the distinction of being the oldest
player in the league by remaining In
harness for one season after Wagner
retires from active play. Christy
Mathewson was ahead of Evers by
two years In making his big league
debut, but Big Six intends to be a
bench manager of the Reds, leaving
Wagner as the only man who has
played longer in tho National League
than Evers.
From what can be gleaned from the
Boston papers appears that Bill
Carrigan, although he has retired
from baseball, would consider return
ing to manage the Red Sox next sea
son. However, It appears to be a
question of whether tho new owners
of the club Intend to make Carrigan
seek the job or the Job seek Carrigan.
If the latter course is pursued there
is a possibility of Bill returning to
help out the new owners; If the for
mer Carrigan will stay In retirement
so far as baseball is concerned. By
some it was thought Carrigan was
holding out for a large increase in sal
ary from tho new owners, but such is
not the case. Bill Is sincere In his
desire to get away from baseball for
other business and for that reason
did not go to Boston when Messrs".
Frazee and Ward were there. Now
the latter intend calling upon Carri
gan at his home at Lowiston, Me., and
when they. d,o it will be definitely de
tided whether Carrigan or some one
elso will lead the Red Sox next sea
son.
Babo Kuth, the Boston southpaw,
was the leading pitcher of the Amer
ican League last -reason, according to
tho olficlal pitching records made pub
lic yesterday. In forty-four games
Ruth pitched a total of 323 2-3 Innings
and allowed an average of only 1.75
earned run8 for each full game of
nine Innings. Eddio Cicijtte of the
White Sox was next in point of effec- j
uveness. allowing lis earned runs
for each nine-inning game. He twirl
ed 187 innings in forty four games.
Walter Johnson, despite lack of sup
port from his team at times, managed
to pitch himself into third position
and proved the hardest working
twirler in the league. Johnson took
part In forty-eight games and in them
pitched a total of 371 innli.gs, which
was more than any ether pitcher
worked. The average against him In
earned runs for each nine-inning
game was 1.89.
It was simply a difference in
courses that gave isrown university
Fred Pollard, the sensational half
back, for the colored wonder bad in
tended to enter Dartmouth, where his
older brother had studied and played
football. But Fred thought the
courses at Dartmouth were not as
well suited to his needs and passed
up the Hanover college for Brown.
Pollard has ability In athletics other
than football and Intends to try for a
place on the Brown track team. He
is a hurdler of more than ordinary
ability and because of his speed on the
flat may also represent the Provi
dence university in the sprints.
It is hard to get accustomed to
connecting Christy Mathewson s
name with the Cincinnati club, but
Big Six Is manager of the Reds in
reality and has been working quietly
to reconstruct his team for next sea
son. So confident Is he of what he
has accomplished that ho recently ex
pressed himself as quite certain the
Reds would finish in the first divis
ion. Matty has not made public all
he has done in the way of rebuilding
the team, but it is asserted that Hal
Chase at first base, Heinle Groh at
second and Ed Rousch In the outfield
are the only players sure of their
places next season.
Harold Janvrin is the only native
of Bcston who is a member of the
champion Red Sox and the young
man's friends in Boston are going to
give him a night all his own In recog
nition of what he did toward helping
to win the American Leafiue pennant
and the world's series. . It will be on
January 15 that the friends of Jan
vrin will gather at a banquet with the
player as the guest of honor.
The announcement by Owner Com
l?key of the Chicago White Sox that
Clarence Rowland had been reap
pointed manager for next season com
pletes the list of leaders in the major
leagues for next year. Despite the
rumors that several changes were to
be made there will be only one new
manager In the big show Fred Mit
chttll of the Cubs.

Startling Experience of Mrs. laura
. ti. lo'e
METHOD CF ENTRANCE A MYSTERY
Neither Money or Goods Taken by In
truders Who Escaped Through
Rear Door,
Early Sunday afternoon two men
were discovered In the Cole clothinc
store by Mrs. Laura Cole. An im
mediate alarm was given but the men
escaped through the back tloor and
their identity has not yet been dis
covered, although the police during
the day made a half dozen arrests on
suspicion. Nothing was taken from
the store and the stock wa3 not dis
turbed. Mrs. Cole and. hor two grandsons,
Charles and John, stopped at the
store on their way to church Sunday
forenoon. Mrs. Cole and the younger
boy remained for the Sunday school
exercises and on their way homo
again called at the store. As she ap
proached the rear end of the fctore
Mrs. Cole noticed that the back door
leading into the alley was unlocked.
Sustiicious that something was
wrong she again made her way to the
front of tho store and as the clia sc
she noticed a man attempting to con
ceal himself behind the long tables
and at the eame time make his way
toward the trail door loading into
the cellar. Thoroughly frightened
Mrs. Cole nevertheless kept up a con
versatiou with the boy until she
reached the front door when she
whispered to the lad that there was a
man in the store.
John dashed into the street where
he met Dean I. Martin and Harry R.
Buss who hurried into the store Just
In time to see two men rush through
the back door. Tracks showed that the
men jumped the fence in the rear oi
the Btore and mado their escape b
the way of the alley in the rear of the
New England Telephone company'b
oftlce.
No one of course knows how the
men effected an entrance into the
store. Mr. Cole Is of the opinion tha:
they went in and concealed them
selves during Mrs. Cole's first visii
to the store Sunday forenoon. An
ether theory i3 that they were In tlu
store during the rush of business Sat
urday evening and took that occasior
to conceal themselves in the base
nient.
If the men had intended to commit
burglary, they had made no progress
at the time they were, discovered
The drawer of the cash register witl

BUSY DAYS FOR MERCHANTS
Carol Singing at Putnam House Cor
ner Attracted Large Crowd
' in Spite of Cold Weather
The Christmas spirit overflowed la
Bennington during the past f-daya.
After his attempt to display all his
wares on Friday, tho weather man
was good and gave us the best holiday
weather he had In his repertoire. Sat
urday was an ideal day for the shop
ers and the deliveries, Sunday was
pleasant and Christmas day Iself waa
ideal, the air being crisp and the sun
deigning to show himself most of the
time.
Tho stores experienced the best
business lr; history. All the facto
ries and other places of employment
in tho village have been running all
year and as a result there was plenty
of money to spend and everyone spent
a goodly sum. The Christmas clubs
were productive of the large amount
which was handed over the counters
in the last few days. The general trend
of the buying was more than ever be
fore toward useful and practical gifts,
the little knick-knacks that are usually
associated with the thought of pres
ent being conspicuous by their ab
sence. The post office and express office
were very busy have not yet caught
up with their regular schedules. The
pestoffice had the biggest rush In
years and, while the force put every
effort into setting thojr deliveries out
ono time, they were handicapped by
the lack of extra help furnished by
the government from keeping up with
the demand. The parcel post busi
ness especially was very large in
volume, as many as four extra ve
hicles being employed to care for it.
The community song festival held
in Christmas afternoon fro mthe Put
nam house veranda was a great auo--ess,
being attended by a large crowd,
which might have been greater but
'or the cold, which forced the listen
ers to keep moving. There were
bout sixty singers in the chorus,
which rendered the following pro
gram:
Oh come, all ye faithful. Old
hymn, sung by everyone in tho
Square.
