"Com t will open at 9 o'clock to

last night, "ami wo are going ahead

ot pi osicntion will hold and an effort
will be made to lift this city out of
tin haiiils of Iho lawless element and
place It where It belongs," he con
tinued. City Attorney Mescrves was em
phatic in bis declaration that no con
victions secured in tho municipal
limit would stand the acid tost thut
defending attorneys would make.
"The convictions will not be worth
a dime," ho declared last night, when
Informed that Judge Cavitt hud an

"I have talked with Judge Doylo
about hts recent decision," Mr. Me
sirvo continued, "und I nm of tho

Justice in Ills recent ruling. We may
get convictions in the municipal court,
hut they are worthless. They will
not stand."
Mr. Mesorve seemed surprised that

W hether this instruction was Issued
by Ciller of Police Lucas or direct
from Judge Cavilt the sergeants did

detectives had the authority of either
tho chief or the Judge to book all

Tho Judge has Inllanctod that ho
will do his share III the vigorous pros

BY SALVATION ARMY
Giant Christmas Tree Loaded
Down With Fruits and
Good Things to Eat.
A screaming, shrieking sea of hu
ninnltv surged toward the stage at
the Convention hall at 1) .'-lock last
night when the entertaining feature
of the Salvation Army's Chrlstmus
exercises for the poor of Tulsa wero
over und tho curtain was raised re
vealing one of the most monster
Christmas trees that was ill evidence
III the city this year.
Following u program of song nnd
recitation given by small boys und
girls, none over 17 years of age, the
tree was revealed and it wus with
ex ding difficulty that Adjutant V.
E. Hlckmun succeeded In quieting tho
three hundred children sufficiently
to render the distribution of tho
many toys possible.
A (.hint Tree.
A monster tree profusely decorated
with electric lights and tinsel stood
in the center of the stage at the mu
nicipal stadium and spivud about Its
base was u mountain of dolls und
other toys dear to the hearts of chil
dren. Distribution of the many sacks of
canilv, the oranges, apples and toys
was greatly delayed by the Inability
of the promoters to keep the children
quiet. Names had boon pinned to
ull of the dolls and other toys and
owing to the great noise tcrought
about by the unbounded enthusiasm
of the children It was much of a tusk
for the dispensers to make their
voices hoard above the cheering.
Convention Hull Filhil.
An audience that completely filled
the Convention hull was seated In
the uuditoiium when the first num
ber on tho program wus announced.
On the first floor all of the scats had
been reserved for the children and
nearly ull were occupied.
When seen shortly lifter the dis
tribution or the toys and fruits wus ,
started, Adjutant Hickman stated
that the tree wus the most success
ful thut the local Salvation Army .
has yet staged.
Ten boxes of oranges wero given
away, several hundred pounds of
candy was presented to the poor chil
dren of tho city und Innumerable ap- ,
pies were likewise passed over ths
footlights to tho wildly scrambling I
children who hud been waiting im
patiently for the vent.
