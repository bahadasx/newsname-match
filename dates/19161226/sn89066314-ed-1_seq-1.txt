GERMANY WANTS MEETING
OF ALL NATIONS IN WAR
In a Reply to President Wilson's Note the Imperial
Government Makes Proposal for An Immedi
ate Gathering of Representatives of the Belig
erents to Discuss Peace.
ASSERTS IT IS
But the Teutons Believe That the Glorious Work
of Attempting to Prevent Future Wars Can Be
Started Only After the Present Struggle Is
Ended.
By United Press
BERLIN, Dec. 26. Germany today proposed an imme
diate meeting of delegates of belligerent nations in her an
swer to President Wilson's peace note, it was officially an
nounced here.
The proposal was made here formally in a peace reply to
the peace suggestions made by the United States by giving a
note to United States Ambassador Gerard at Berlin and at
the same time American diplomatic representatives of the
other Central powers.
The note also hints that the glorious work of attempting
to prevent future wars can be begun only after the end of
the present struggle of nations. It declares that when this
moment shall have come Germany will be ready with pleas
ure to co-operate with the United States in this exalted task.
The German note holds that the most appropriate route to
reach the desired results is a meeting of delegates of bellig
erent states in a neutral state. The text of the note follows :
"The high minded sugges
tion made by the President of
the United States of America
in order to create a basis for
the establishment of a lasting
peace has been received and
considered by the Imperial
Government in the friendly
way which was expressed in
the President's communica
tion. "President Wilson points
out that which he had at heart
and what he believes is the
best and most feasible peace
route. To the Imperial Gov
ernment the immediate ex
change of views seems the
most appropriate plan in or
der to reach the desired re
sults. It therefore states in
the sense of a stipulation made
on December 12, which con
firms its language for peace
negotiations, to propose an
immediate meeting of dele
gates of the belligerent na
tions in a neutral place.
"Although the Imperial
Government is of the opinion
that the great work of the pre
vention of future wars can be
begun only after the end of
Jhe present struggle of nations
ended, it (The Imperial
Jerman Government) will,
when this moment shall have
come, be ready with pleasure
to co-operate with the United
"States in this exalted task.

THE BEST WAY
taincd in President Wilson's note.
British Xot So Hostile.
LONDON, Dec. 26. British hostili
ty toward President Wilson's peace
message has been considerably nulli
fied today. The change was. attribut
able to the latest interpretation of the
motives behind the dispatch of the
American note.
London now. regards it as having
been sent for the main purpose of
forcing Germany to state her peace
terms and to carry the implication
that unless these terms are "satisfac
tory" America may enter the war upon
the side of the allies.
There was, however, considerable
criticism of what was termed the
"President Wilson obscurity and unfe
licity of language," and his apparent
reversal of principles since May 27,
when he stated that America was not
concerned with the causes and objects
of the war.
Wont Satisfy the Allies.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. i A hasty
examination of Germany's reply to
President Wilson's peace message as
contained in Berlin's dispatches to
Ambassador von Bernstorff today
leave an impression that the entente
allies will not be satisfied to meet
the Teutonic proposals. Officials de
clare that Count von Bernstorff is
strongly of the opinion that the pro
posals would be unsatisfactory to the
entente powers as far as hope of ar
ranging a peace conference at this
time is concerned. He expressed the
view that the allies would not be will
ing to consent to a meeting on any
terms as set forth by Germany.
Representatives of the entente al
lies held that Germany had directly
dodged the request of the United
States for something specific in the
way of peace terms.
Germany's answer agreed with Am
bassador von Bcrnstorff's recent state
ment that Germany is willing to set
forth her terms at a round table ses
sion. Xo Future Peace Term'?,
fly United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. More Im
portant than any other consideration
as regards success of the President's
negotiations is the fact that Germany
declines now to discuss future guar
antees of peace. Ambassador von
Bernstorff held that the allied nations'
reply on the subject of future guar
antees of peace are the basis for Ger
many's taking this attitude, after giv
ing the peace proposal more careful
study and hence her refusal to discuss
anv such guarantees.
Preliminary examination indicates
to American officials that the Entente
allies will be unwilling to join in
mnvinir such assertions unless they
get something more definite on which
in nrnepprt.
All officials expressed pleasure over
Germany's prompt response to the
President's note. While many ad
mittedly were disappointed at the ab
sence of specific terms asked for they
point out that any peace discussions
at this time and for some time to come
must of necessity be prolonged from
the nature of the circumstances be
fore the "belligerents can get right
down to brass tacks."
Austrian Dettrojer 3Inke Raid.

BERLIN, Dec. 2G. Four Austria
Hungarian destroyers made a success
ful raid in the straights of Otranto,

companied by infantry action, in the
region of Monastir, were reported in

CARRANZAJSIN CRISIS
Settlement of Mexico's Trou
ble With U. S. Depends
on the Chief's Answer.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2G Settlement
of difficulties between Mexico and the
United States by peaceful means de
pends upon what answer Carranza
gives to the last order on troop re
moval. Official announcement was
made today that the government ex
pected to hear from Carranza tomor
row. Difficulties in transmission may
delay the answer, but this government
does not propose to negotiate farth
er with Carranza on this point. If Car
ranza signs this stipulation the com
mission's sessions will be at an end.
This will leave the situation as it
was before the commission convened
at New London in the early fall. It
may mean, too, a firmer policy on the
part of this government in dealing
with Mexico.
The War Department, it was said
officially, declared that no order to
deal with the situation which might
follow a refusal to sign, had been is--sued.

All 31aterlals Used for Feeding Do
mestic Animals to Be Analyzed.
The conference, called by the presi
dent of the Missouri State Board of
Agriculture in St. Louis last week to
discuss the proposed pure feeding
stuffs law, decided that the law was
desirable, and Dean F. B. Mumford of
the College of Agriculture was chosen
to prepare it. The law will provide
for the registration of all materials
used for feeding domestic animals. All
feeds sold, under the law, would have
the guaranteed chemical analysis
printed on the cover, and an organiza
tion In charge would collect samples
of the feed, publish a report concern
ing them and see to the penalties for
disobeying the law.

THE DREWS DISCUSS
T
Member of Famous Actor
Family and Missouri Girl,
His Wife, Are Here.
ASKS NATURALNESS
Mr. Drew Says That He De
plores Managers Who
Say, "Pose."
Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, given
a chance today to talk about any
thing in the world from cabbages
to kings, spoke on the subject in which
they arc both most interested motion
pictures.
At the home of Mrs. Drew's mother,
Mrs. C. F. McVey, in the Dumas Apart
ments, they arc taking a week's rest
from their all-absorbing work of writ
ing, directing and acting photoplay
comedies for the Metro-Drew Com
pany. "I demand naturalness in motion
pictures," said Mr. Drew, "and I de
plore the sort of manager who says
to his victim: 'Pose! Hold it' with
a characteristic gesture. Mrs. Drew
tries to portray the middle-class
American woman as she is, and the
result is a more Interesting character
than the too 'dolled-up' leading la
dy, wjipm we tend to, and which she
calls;' 'heroine-worship.' "
The Drews like motion pictures bet
ter than the stage, because in the for
mer one does not have to live "in a
trunk." Then, too, as Mrs. Drew sug
gested, it is more like an ordinary
business life in which they start to
work early In the morning and work
all day. Her husband expressed ad
miration for the opportunity his pres
ent occupation affords of being amus
ed at night instead of having to
amuse others as he did when on the
"legitimate" stage. Mr. Drew thinks
he 'will probably never leave the mov
ies for the stage, but did not say
poJUIvely that.ho wQuJd..ijot, If. he
used bromides, which he doesn't, he
might have used George Bernard
Shaw's familiar idiom, "You never can
tell."
The Drews like the plot clement to
be uppermost in a scenario; other
wise, they think the camera clement
plajs too great a part. Mrs. Drew
considers Daid Wark Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation" the best produc
tion ever filmed.
. The American public probably does
not appreciate the hard work this
member of a family of famous actors
and the former Sedalia girl, his wife,
undergo to make them laugh. They
make one scenario a week, buying
merely the idea and working them up,
themselves. Even on Saturday after
noons and Sundajs, which they spend
at "Seagate," their home by the sea,
they must prepare their comedy for
the following week out of the best ma
terial they have on hand, instead of
relaxing completely as they would like
to.
This is Mr. Drew's second visit to
Columbia, the first, however, being a
professional one, when he played in
"Billy" at the Columbia Theater eight
years ago. Mrs. Drew has made two
other visits to Columbia, one when
she was on a chatauqua program and
the other when she gave several read
ings at a University Assembly.
Although Mr. Drew is surprisingly
serious in private life, discussing
weighty matters for thirty minutes,
was too much for him. He excused
himself to "arrange his pedal ex
tremities," preparatory to being taken
downtown by a friend.
ROCK BREAKS SHOP WINDOW
Only An Automobile Accident, Was the
Theory of the Police.
A rock, weighing about one-half
pound, thrown by either a person or
by an automobile wheel, smashed one
of the large plate glass windows in
the Kress Store Company's building
on East Broadway early this after
noon. The rock broke the window but
did not go through it.
The police believe that the damage
was accidental, since the rock hit the
window just as a large automobile
passed.
Eastern Star Installs Officers.
The installation of officers of the
Boone chapter of the Eastern Star was
held Thursday night in lodge rooms.
A sandwich tray was presented to
Miss Pauline Klass in recognition of
her services of the last two years as
organist of the lodge and in honor of
her approaching manage. After the
installation, refreshments were served.

GIVE LA1VS0X CHAXCE TO TELL
Congress Would Know About Leaks
From Washington.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 If Thomas
W. Lawson can prove there is always
a leak In important moves in Wash
ington, especially in connection with
European International matters, he
will be given an opportunity to de
liver such proof to Congress in per
son. Lawson may even be called to give
such testimony as" he claims to- have,
whether he wants to or not. Chair
man Henry of the Rules Committee,
to which Representative Woods' inves
tigation resolution was referred today,
extended a formal invitation to Law
son to tell the committee all he knows
about any leaks.
"If Mr. Lawson has any information
about leaks he has to come before the
Rules Committee and furnish us with
the evidence. We will be glad to have
it if he has any to give, as his testi
mony would result in a favorable re
port on the Woods resolution," said
Chairman Henry today. "Let Mr. Law
son come here and we will give him a
hearing, since he claims to be so well
informed," declared Mr. Henry.
Chairman Henry said no considera
tion would be given the Woods reso
lution until after the holidays.
The Woods resolution demanding a
probe of charges that insiders on Wall
Street profited through a leak in in
formation regarding the Wilson peace
message was followed by a statemen
from Lawson's office Saturday night
that millions had been made through
such leaks.

LUTE HOLDUPS SI
TO BE EXAGGERATED
Chief of Police Believes He
Has Found Man Who
Robbed Students. .
IS GETTING EVIDENCE
Suspicious Conditions In So
rority Houses Lead to
Fruitless Inquiry.
That the number of robberies and
holdups in Columbia recently has been'
greatly exaggerated, that none have
occurred since Friday night and that
considerable "pranking" has been
connected with the socalled "crime
wave" is the belief of Chief of Police
J. L. 'Whitesides. Moreover, Chief
Whitesides believes that he has in cus
tody the negro who held up four Uni
versity students two weeks ago.
The negro is in the city Jail and evi
dence is being collected to add to
what the officers already have against
him.
Although many reports have been
made since Friday as to attempted rob
beries and holdups, the police believe
that none have occurred.
J. R. Richards, 1606 University av
enue, this morning said that he found
evidence of an attempt to break Into
his garage when he returned home
about 12 o'clock last night The glass
door was broken and the lock had
been bored out of the door. Mr. Rich
ards believes his automobile was the
object of the attempte'd theft, but as
he was driving it at the time, the at
tempt was futile. Nothing in the gar
age was disturbed.
The police know nothing about the
case.
A reported holdup on Fifth street
last night was said, by the police, to
be unfounded.
Saturday night a telephone call to
the police gave the information that
the lights in the Kappa Alpha Theta
house. 906 University av?pue, were
burning. The police went to the ad"
dress and found the lights in one
room on the second floor burning, but
that none of the contents of the
rooms had been disturbed.
Sunday night the Rev. W. W. El
wang telephoned the police that the
electric lights in the Delta Gamma
house, 315 Hitt street, were burning.
Chief Whitesides visited the place
and turned out the lights. Nothing
had been disturbed.
N.o report of the supposed holdup
near the Law Building Saturday night
has reached the police. "
