A - President Wilson in which he asked '
that the belligerent nations state the
aims for which they are fighting. The
proposal is made that a conference of
I delegates of all the belligerents be
f held immediately in a neutral city.
The task of preventing the future
wars, the official statement says, can
be begun only after the end of the
; present struggle.
BEPtlptf, 'Deer*2 6?The text of
Germany's answer to President Wilson's
note was transmitted Tuesday
to James W. Gerard, the American
ambassador.
The answer, which also contains
the repW "" *-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded suggestion made
by the president of the United States
of America, in order to create a basis
for the establishment of a lasting
peace, has been received and considered
by the imperial covernment in
the friendly spirit which was expressed
in the president's communication.
"The ' president points out that
which he has at heart and leaves
open the choice of roads.
"To the imperial government an immediate
exchange of views seems to be
the mo-t appropriate road in order to
reach the desired results.
"It begs, therefore, in the sense of
the declaration made on December 12,
which offered a hand for peace negotiations,
to propose an immediate meeting
of delegates of the belligerent
states at a neutral place.
"The imperial government is also of
the opinion that the great work of preventing
future wars can "be begun only
' after the fj}d of the present struggle
of the nations.
"It will when this moment shall have
come be ready with pleasure to collaborate
with the United States in this
exaicea lasn. .
The answer of the Central powers
concludes with the usual diplomatic
terms of politeness.

PARIS, Dec. 26.?In addresses at the
national congr ess of the French Socialist
party, Arthur Henderson, the British
cabinet minister, and G. M. Robterts.
member of the British parliament,
both affirmed amid enthusiastic cheers.
V that the war must be fought out until
full guarantees have been obtained for
a lasting peace.
"In my opinion," said Mr. Henderson,
"if France and ourselves were to
enter into negotiations under existing
conditions we would be nations ii
bondage. 'Nothing less than that is the
price our enemies would exact for
peace today."
Emile Vandervelde, the Belgian Socialist
leader, said:
"Our comrades who have remained
in invaded Belgium support German
dominions with admirable firmness.
Nothing but encouragement reaches us
from them. So it would seera that the
If persons most hostile to war are those
fartherest from it."
M. Vandervelde also declared that
the struggle must be -carried on un*il
Belgium and Serbia are. delivered and
"Ceasarism is laid low."

BRIDGEPORT, Dec. 26?Hundreds
of friends and relatives attended
the funeral of Miss Wilda'Chorpening,
which was held from the
Bridgeport Baptist church Sundaymorning
at 11 o'clock. The services
were impressively conducted by the
pastor, the Rev. Robert Bragg, with
the Rev. George Woofter reading the
Scripture lesson, and the Rev. A. B.
Withers offering prayer. At the
close of the service the Rev F. S. Arnett
offered a word of prayer, and
"Not One Forgotten," "Why Not Tonight"
and "We'll Never Say Goodby
in Heaven" were rendered by the
choir, and "The Cross is Not Greater"
was sung by the pastor and Alfred
Bragg. The selections were all
iavontes of tne deceased girl. Misses
Virginia Withers, Flora Davisson,
Mabel Williams, Esther Cornwell,
Audra Perry and Flossie Lanham,
schoolmates of the deceased girl,
were the bearers of many floral tributes.
Donley Taylor, Gordon Cornwell,
Murray Cornwell, Clark Perry
and Hollls Perry-were the pallbearers.
The body was laid to rest in
the Masonic cemetery.
"Hope of the Christmas Day" Is
the title of a sacred cantata that was
well rendered by the Methodist Protestant
Sunday school at their church
Sunday evening. The theme was a
most beautiful one. Hope, the daughter.
of the inn-keeper, found a vase
left by one of the Wise Men which
she eagerly believes was left behind
intentionally as a token of appreciation
of some kindness shown them.
She proudly shows it to her many
friends until Herod, fearing that this*
might be some evidence of the visit
of the Wise Men to the Savior's
birthplace, seeks one of his trusted
messengers with an offer to buy it.
But Hope treasures the vase too highly
to part with it, and Herod, thwarted
in his plans, instructs his man to
dash the vase to the floor, if opportunity
offers, and break it into a
thousand pieces. When the vase is
broken it liberates a most fragrant
npvfnrr*o tchlnh cnTea^o all amnnfl
attracting much attention and admiration,
Herod's attempt to destroy it
actually assisting in its becoming
well known. It reaches the lame,

Told by German Government
to Mind Their Own Business
about Belgians.
(BV ASSOCIATED PRCS*'
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 2 6.?The Telegraff
says It has reason to believe
that Germany's reply to Holland's
note regarding the deportation of
i Belgian workmen is framed in such
terms that it was inadvisable to communicate
it. to the Dutch parliament
and that the government has requested
Berlin to alter the reply in such
a manner that it may be presented
to the parliament.
The Dutch government last month
instructed Its Berlin representative
to notify Germany that the Belgian,
deportations had caused a painful
impression in Holland. A despatch
on December 5 said Germany had responded
in words which were tantamount
to saying "mind your own
business."
