sides with lnrtre bamboo canopies, be
neath whioh were tables lnden with
re'freslimrnts of all descriptions. In
the center were a great number of
tables where the guests were to feast
on imperial food. The culinary was
a very interesting and important part
of the party. The food was foreign
but arranged in Japanese style. Of
course one is elaborately served by
the Japanese and his affair, to say
the least, proved no exception to the
rule.
We chatted and ate until Anally ev

a second view of the emperor and
empress.
As all things draw to a close, thus
did the garden party. We passed out
from those most beautiful grounds
realizing we had enjoyed a rare priv-
ilegefnot granted to many of the em
peror's own subjects.

It is rumored that the state high
way commission 's report on the inter-
county bridge may give the structure
several years more of life 'though with
greatly restricted traffic. This latest
possibility is contrary to the belief
of Polk county officials and bridge
men but is given credence in some
quarters. It is understood that, in
case the state highway commission
rules as above, the maximum load on
the bridge will be placed at 3000
pounds. Other restrictions such as
distance between vehicles, direction of
traffic and speed, may be suggested,
Polk officials feel that a good
bridge, a safe bridge, is needed across
the river at Salem. They think that
it would be an unwise policy that
would prolong the life of a tottering
structure which can not handle traffic
properly. They are agreed that a new
bridge should be built immediately
und the men from all parts of the
county who have been in the court
house the past week agree with the
county officers. "Build a good bridge
right away ' ' epitomizes the expression
of men from each section of the coun
ty. They say this with the knowledge
that Polk county, if it advances its
one-third share of the minimum,
$250,000, for the bridge, will have ex
hausted its 1917 funds. They realize,
in that case, that there can. be no
road building in 1917. They are be
ing told just that by the county judge
and yet not one has even intimated
that he would rather have a road than
a bridge. Polk opinion seems to be
solidified ,' Build a bridge."
Dallas will have Uf wait. A con
crete bridge, said to have been prom
ised early this year by the court to
a section near this city for 1917, can
not be built. The covered wooden
bridge that has spanned the creek at
this place for the past 35 years and
which is now sadly incompetent to
handle the traffic will have to creak
out another year of life. And so it
is in all parts of the county. Each
section will have to postpone, says the
county court.
There is just one hope that the
county will have enough money to
build the Salem bridge and keep up
with the progressive road work that
is the receipt of back 0. and C.
taxes. That possibility has' gleamed
for several years for the county and
when it is received the amount will
be reckoned with.

Mill Closed Down Friday Noon.
A slight break caused the Willam
ette Valley Lumber company s mill
to close Friday, a day before it was

pairs. .
Finish Giving Examinations.
As no candidate for life certificates
appeared before the county school
superintendent for examination Sat
urday the examinations were declar
ed closed and the papers of those per
sons who took specified examinations
Thursday and Friday were sent to the
office of the state superintendent of
public instruction Saturday after
noon. The papers will be passed up
on by the county school superinten
dents who will gather in Salem dur
ing the second week in January, and
then will be handed to the state school
superintendent.
Partridge To Live in Monmouth.
It is rumored that B. M. Partridge,
who has operated a brick and tile
yard near this city, will move to
Monmouth in 1917 to engage in bus
iness there. He is said to have leased
the Monmouth plant of C. Lorence,
administrator of the estate of the
late George F. Shew, and expects to
start work about April 1.

Sheridan Has Community Celebration
The city of Sheridan held a com
munity Christmas celebration on the
street Sunday night, a big tree having
been placed on Bridge street, near
the Hotel Sheridan, and profusely
decorated and lighted for the occa
sion. Christmas carols were sung by
a chorus, and the chief feature of
the entertainment was the rendition
of "The Holy City" in song and pa
geant. Other numbers were also on
the program, and 600 bags, liberally
filled with candies, nuts and oranges,
were distributed. It was the first
community Christmas held in Sheridan.

SANTA VISITS THE POOR
K. OF F. ANNUAL GIFT DAY WAS
SATURDAY.
Jo Helgerson and 'Top" Morton
Were Deputized as Assistants.
Food and Candy Given,
"I guess Santa won't come this
year" said a six-year-old little girl
"because we have no Christmas tree.''
And then she was shown that Santa
had not forgotten her. Santa was
ordered not to forget her 'by the Mor
mion lodge, number 96, Knights of
Pvthias. She was just one wnose
child's dream eame true because there
are big hearted men in Dallas men
who easily spanned the years back,
back to the time when they, too, wait
ed anxiously for Christmas morn.
This little girl was alone when Lot
Brown's automobile with Joe Helger
son at the wheel, called at her house.
"Mamma is at church, reading out
of the Bible. Daddy is at work," she
answered the questions asked ber.
Her three little brothers were away.
The bed was unmade and badly soil
ed; the kitchen floor was clean but
pots with the grease around the sides
stood on the cold kitchen stove. Most
likely her father and mother and
brothers were happy when the got
home for potatoes, a sack of flour, a
box of apples and a stocking full of
childish goodies were left for each
child. The only difference between
these children's stockings and that of
their more fortunate brothers and sis
ters was that they eame earlier than
the others.
There was one place a tent where
father and mother and six children
lived. There was no money there and
four of the children were just recov
ering from the measles. The father
and mother were happy to receive tbe
food; the children's eyes sparkled at
tbe package of toys and tbe candy
and nuts and oranges and popcorn,
and da, and da, and da. An old eon-
pie, over the three score and ten, were
children again a they reeeived tbeir
gifts. There wasn t mneh food in this
bom.
She can't read or writ and she
lives alone. She has a daughter in
Colorado who won't do anything for
her. She was made happy. And so
the list might be extended.
'The poor ye have always with
-on" is just as true now a ever,
it seems. They are right here may

N'la K. of P. lodge hadn't oH-r
. to go.
A meeting of the taxpayers of Polk
county is scheduled with tbe county
court next Friday morning at 10 o'
clock, when the budget for the year
1917 will be thoroughly gone into and
the final levies set. Judge Kirkpat
rick, who will preside at the meeting,
is particularly anxious that a large
number of Polk's taxpayers turn out
to this meeting. A full opportunity
will be given them to discuss pro or
con the estimated expenditures and
receipts of the county for the coming
year, as proposed by the court.
One of the most important items
to be discussed is that of the inter-
county bridge over the river at Sa
lem. The court proposes to raise
about $42,000 by special taxation for
the construction of the bridge in
1917. This amount will have to be
added to make approximately $83,000, ;
which is Polk's one-third ot the to
tal cost of $250,000. For this pur
pose it is intended to use $25,000 from
the bridges and ferries fund, on the
bridge besides $12,000 as the coum-
ty's share of the three-mill tax levy
raised in the road districts, so that
at ine ouisiae rout county wiu uuijr
be able to put $79,000 into a bridge
next year, unless the $50,000 back
O. & C. taxes are received. Thy

year has all been expended, - ;"
