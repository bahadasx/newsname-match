Expenses have not kept pace with
the rapid rise in receipts. From a total

approximately 11 per cent. During that
period 1 ecelpts had Increased from

About 230,50i) miles of railroad were

' ompared with previous earnings,
net income for 1916 shows an increase
of more than 52 per cent over the fiscal
year of 191,5, 59 per cent over 1314 and
34 !>er cent over 1913.
Wide divergence in receipts among
the roads of various sections is dis
closed. The overburdened railroads of
ihe East have skimmed the cream of
the traflic. The congestion at Eastern
seaports and on almost every Eastern
road has spelled, in slutted sidings
and slow-moving traflic. a flood of
revenue, the like of which was un
dreamed of even a year ago. Por every
mile of the 59.200 in tlie Eastern group
more than $2,000 has been received in
revenue, and every mile has earned a
net income of nearly $5,900. Eastern
roads have received almost as much
In passenger fares as all the rest of
the roads in the country put together,
w.th a total of 170.S00 miles.
The railroads of the South, with
42.UOO miles, conic next to those of the
East in revenue per'inlie. with $1 1,922.
about 58 pet- cent of what the Eastern
roads received. Net income on Soul It
em roads was approximately $3,500
per mile. On Western roads the reve
nue. per mile was approximately $11.

Western roads. however, show a
greater net income in proportion to
receipts. Percentage of net income to
gross receipts was:
For the entire country, approxi
mately 30 per cent; for Eastern and
Southern roads, 29 per cent; for West

also led those of all other sections in
the amount of taxes paid, $71.263,6)1.

"Calls for aid are always more nu

about sixty miles south of Diamond

Sucrosa's bow. then, circling, crossed
astern and disappeared in the dark

repeated the performance. This time

Swiss note, pledging support to the
President's peace policy, was accepted
as practically guaranteeing prompt

Scandinavian nations could he ex

Swiss note, within a few days.

he felt confident that Sweden would

: for more than a year has been active

Minister ISkengren some time ago
l sought to secure the co-operation of

' tions. but President Wilson declined
i to enter any "entangling alliances" at
I that time. Since the. German peace

more than ever anxious for peace ne

An overenthusiastic indorsement of
the President's proposals by Sweden at
this time, administration officials said
to-night, might prove embarrassing,
j rather than helpful. The accepted pro
(iermati tendencies in Sweden, it was
? stated, might serve to further com
j plicate the difficulties which President
I Wilson's proposal confronts in the en
! tente nniions, because It was for
warded so closely on the heels of the
| German peace advances. For this rea
i son, there was a feeling that the cause
of ultimate peace might be better
served, if other neutral nations, not so
closely identified with the war tone,
came forward to the support of the
President before Sweden's note was
sent. Whether any general under
standing among the neutrals of the
world as to the time of forwarding
their notes approving the President's
course has been arranged could not
be determined to-night. Such an un
i derstanding. if it exists, will probably
, delay Sweden's communication until
! some of the other neutrals have stated
j their views.
