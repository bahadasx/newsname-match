HENEY MAY RUN FOR
GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 26. Political
wiseacres are all excited over the pros-,
pects of Francis J. Heney being a can
dldate for governor of California at ,
the next election. In view of the per
sistent rumors that the Californlan la
slated for a cabinet position, the boom
for Heney started at a Woodrow Wil
son banquet here has shattered the
good old dope, and even the wiaeat
admit they are at sea.
Heney. aside from saying he appre
ciated the compliment extended to bira.
and inUmatlng that the boomlet might
be premature, has not discussed the
matter. Reports that he will not take
a federal portfolio so he can run for
governor are current and so are re
ports exactly opposite.
