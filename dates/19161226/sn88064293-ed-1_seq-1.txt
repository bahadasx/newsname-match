Dislribatisn of Dolls end Toys by Hie Kings üoügiilers if
liily Hail Saturday Was Successful.
Long before the hour set loi
the distribution of the Review j
Dot I and Toy Fund by the Kings
Daughters, which was set for j
8 o'clock Saturday afternoon,
lundred of them j
gazing in wonder I
children from every direction
were seen gazing expectantly at j
the city hall, When the hour
of the distribution arrived there j
were several
in the build in
at the magnificent feast which
had been prepared for them by
the thoughtful people* of Morgan
City. When Santa Claus ap
peared and went the rounds,
shaking hands with each one oj
them, the Joy of the kiddies was
complete and their faith in Santa
Claus was sustained, and when

Sagta showed that he had human I
tendencies by grabbing a pretty j
girl and dancing a lively one step
they cheered iustily. «

'THE EAGLE'S WINGS'
Party lines were obliterated by the
fight in Congress over the Maynard
preparedness measure. Senator
Wright, millionaire pump manufac
turer, is leader of the opposition.
Richard Wallace, foreman of the
Wright's works, is in love with Mona
Wright, but her father's opposition,
based largely on Wallace's enthus
iasm for preparedness, is an
mourftable obstacle to Wallace's am
bition.
While the Mayland Bill is under
discussion before Chairman Wright's
committee, Wallace goes to the bor
der to establish a pumping system
on the ranch of Senator Wright's
son. Responding to an invitation to
visit his son's ranch, the Senator in
definitely adjourns consideration, in
insur
committee of the Maynard Bill, and i
leaves for New Mexico. While Sena- i
tor Wright is on the border Mexican
bandits make a raid, and Wright and
the other men are forced to give vig
orous battle in defence of their loved
ones. *
Wright wires to the War Depart
ment to send an army to defend the'as,
border. The department answers
that it has no army. Wright, now a
live to the emergency, returns to
Washington and in vigorous speech, j
swings enough of the opposition to j
support the Maynard Bill and pass it ;
by a large majority. Wallace has j
long cherished plans for industrial
co-operation in time of National
need, and he is now called before
the president and cabinet to explain
his ideas for the captains of America
industry to come to the rescue of the
country.
Every lathe and wheel that can
be applied in any way to manufac
turing guns and munitions is put to
work for the army and navy. For
eign intrigue is baffled and America
is quickly prepared.

With cotton, rice and sugar in a

Coast States are taking steps to in- j
sure a long continued era of pros-j

The Gulf Coast Country of Ala

■ organized the Gulf Coast Develop
ment League and backed by bankers,
cut-ovet land owners and winter re
sort proprietors, will'spend $250,000
in a five year campaign of national
publicity and advertising to settle
and develop the cut-over lands of
the Gulf Coast Country, bring in
new investment capital and attract
we'althy tourists. Henry Hall, presi

POISONS THAT LURK IN INNO
CENT FLOWERS
Many people fall into the habit of
unconsciously biting off petals of
flowers, the stems and leaves of
plants etc., and chewing them. This
is a dangerous practice, as analyses
of the juices of the different plants
have showç many of them to contain
dangerous poisons.
Red poppies, the source of opium, j
will produce drowsiness if chewed,
and poisons in the leaves of the au
tumn crocus cause vomiting. Flow
ers of the jonquil, white hyacinth
and snowdrop are all poisonous; if a
small leaf of the narcissus should be
put in the mouth the result might be
fatal, as it contains a dangerous
poison.
People have lost their lives as a
result of tasting the berries of the
yew and it is a well known fact that
eating the kernals from peach or
cherry pits is fraught with danger,
they contain prussic acid. Every
one knows of the painful, disagree
able reS ults that follow handling
poison ivy, and lady's slipper's some
times poison even as much as ivy
does. Lobelias are poisonous, and
unies of the valley, seeminly, the
most innocent of plants, should be
handled with caution. The leaves,
and flowers of the oleander contain
an irritating substance and even
bark of the catalpa tree will often
work harm when handled with
sweat hands. Some of the common i
and supposedly least harmful trees,
flowers, ect., contain substances
which are injurious when taken into
the body or when allowed to come in
uuntact with the skin.
IN REMEMBRANCE
Washington, D. C., Dec.—-In re
membrance of her son who was
drowned twenty-one yars ago while
[heroically trying to save the life of
ja comrade, Mrs. M. A. Ommanncv of
Stanford University, Calif., has
written to the commandant of th'
United States Marine Corps, enclos
ing a contribution for the purpose
of sending a little Christmas remerr*
; brftnce to some Marine serving his
1 country in Haiti. With« the letter
was a brief homily to be sent to the
recipient of the gift, filled with
-motherly sentiment and advice, and
an offer to adopt the Marine as he:
son, should he be without a mother,
; Major General Barnett was so im
! pressed with the thoughtful sympa
' thy expressed by Mrs. Ommanney in
j her letter, that he has considered it
! worthy of being brought to the at
j tention of both men and officers of
j United States Marines, serving in all
! parts of the world.
