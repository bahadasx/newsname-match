The United States weather bu­
reau late this afternoon gave out
the information that the storm
which reached the proportions of
a blizzard is the worst ever known

since the weather station was es­
tablished here 48 years ago.

line trains out of Mandan are be­
ing held there. With the blizzard
showing no sign of abatement at
5 o'clock, it will probably mean a
tie-up of all traffic for a few days.
The Capitol street car line has not
operated its car today. Taxis and
automobiles this afternoon used
the side-walks in places where
snow was too deep to buck. There
is no traffic from the downtown
district to the capitol building.
Eighteen inches of snow was re
ported late today on the level, an
inch falling since noon.
The Western Union office an­
nounces tnat all messages for
all points west of Chicago, includ­
ing the RopKy mountain states
and the Pacific'coast, are taken
subject to delay.
Growing hourly in density and in­
tensity and yith a zero wave pur­
suing, blizeafd, which is general
over the northwest, is sweeping
across this section of the state, pro­
pelled by a 3&inile an hour gale.
Warnings were sent out early by Or­
ris W. Roberts, government observer
here, to livestock dealers, railroads
and rural mail carriers. A tempera­
ture of ten degrees below by tomor­
row morning is predicted.

Slump
New York, Dec. 26.—America is in­
toxicated! Intoxicated with money!
Wle are reeling through the last days
of 1916 in an extravagant luxury
spree unparalleled in all world his­
tory!
"The fact is," says an observer,
"your Uncle Sam is actually as light­
headed from over-indulgence in gold
as he .would be if he'd imbibed too
freely of the golden lijquid that flows
these nights in the champagne chat­
eaux of Broadway!"
While the prosperity fever is na­
tion-wide, it has come to a head in
New York, the world's money center.
And recent whirlwinds in Wlall street,
the money center of New York, are
declared to have revealed in a start­
ling manner the extent of the reck­
less extravagance sweeping America.
Nothing short of tlie peace propos­
als of Germany and the consequent
partial collapse in Wall street could
have so sharply shown up the golden
skeleton of our .prosperity. The re­
cent slump was like the caving-in of
a small portion of a great palace, re-'
vealing an amazing cross-section of
wealth, luxury and extravagance with­
in
In that peace proposal flurry for­
tunes were lost, two men died be­
side the tickers in biokers* offices,
lire times as many shares were trad­
ed In the week of the excitement as
in the corresponding week of 1915!
But the fortunes lost we're merely a
drop out of a bucket of wealth. The
big losses simply served to uncover
how the millions made in America in
the last two years are being spent,
without even slowing down the spend­
ing!
Several paper fortunes of over a
million were reduced to less than
$100,000 in a couple of lioura. A
young broker who had made $120,000
in war brides was put suddenly $15
000 into the hole!
A leading steel man wrote off
$1,'900,0'00 from his .profits in United
States Steel!
Fortunes Melt Away.
A girl telephone operator who had
built up $800 into $18,000 and was liv­
ing a luxurious bachelor girl life on
$200 a week income, lost everything
and is now in a sanitarium with nerv­
ous prostration.
A curb broker, caught short, tried
to sell his $1400 car for $500 cash!
Losses Not Felt.
The significance of these figures is
said to be in the fact that the losses
have hardly ibeen felt! They simply
disclose in startling fashion the amaz­
ing scope of America's war-made for­
tunes, and of Wall street's gambling.
The stage is already 'being set for
more speculative sprees on the stock
exchange. The money madness
grows fiercer still, and New York's
holiday extravagance booms along,
greater than ever, to the joy of mer­
chants, hotel keepers, restaurateurs
and theatre managers.

Washington, Dec. 26.—Unless Car
ranza returns a favorable answer to
the last communication made to his
commissioners by the Ameircan repre­
sentatives a week ago at Philadelphia,
the negotiations will come to an end.
The Mexican commissioners will
meet at New York today, and if Car
ranza has sent to them his answer, it
is expected Luis Cabrera, chairman of
the Mexican delegation, will forward
it immediately to Secretary Lane,
chairman of the American section.
When the joint Mexican-American
commission reconvened at Philadel­
phia, Alberto J. Pani, the Mexican
commissioner who carried the proto­
col signed at Atlantic City to Quere
tero for the ratification of General
Carranza, he submitted a counter pro­
posal. It was, in effect, a rejection of
the agreement entered into by the
commissioners and Ihe substitution of
another protocol which had been
drafted by the Mexican commissioners
at the direct'on ,pf Carranza.
The Aemr.'cans replied in a written
communication saying they could not
conside the counter protocol and in­
sisted the agreement already made
must either bp ratified or rejected
definitely. Some aspect of an ultima­
tum was £iven thee communication by
the insistence that, an answer would
be expected by December 26.
NO ORDERS GIVEN.
'Washington, Doc. 20.—No order lias
been issued by the war department
to the American forces for any ac­
tion in event of Carranza refusing to
sign the troop withdrawal protocol, it
was stated at the war department to­
day. It was stated that in event of
the first chief's refusal to sign, the
agreement that 75,000 more militia­
men might ibe sent to the border.
NO WORD RECEIVED.
(By Associated Press.)
New York, Dec. 26.—The Mexican
members of the joint commission had
received no word from General Car­
ranza regarding the American com­
munication up to 1:1") o'clock this af­
ternoon, it was stated 'iere by Luis
Cabrera.
SAND STORMS.

Rome, Dec. -26,—Germany has hand­
ed to the world's neutrals representa
tis at Rome, through .whom she com­
municated the last peace note she
sent to the Entente allies, a sealed
package in which are the terms ui»on
which she would make peace, accord­
ing to an unconfirmed rumor current
here today.
The package is to be opened, and
its contents made known to Germany's
enemies, in case her enemies actually
and specifically ask for the terms up­
on which Germany would consider
peace. Otherwise, the package is to
be returned unopened. No comment
upon the reported package \vas to be
had at the Vatican today.
Upon President Wilson's peace pro­
posal, officials today refused to com­
ment. The Italian press still thinks
some secret diplomacy^, was respon­
sible for President Wils«*'s move.
To Confer With Kaiser.
American Ambassador Gerard was
due to have a conference with Kaiser
Wilhelm late this afternoon, accord­
ing to Berlin dispatches received at
Amsterdam. The same dispatches al­
so reported that thekaiser had invit­
ed Dr| W. E. Deberlacde, Swiss min­
ister, to a conference at the German
palace.
It is presumed that tho object, of the
conference was discussion of the Wil­
son peace note, in which Switzerland
has now joined.
PEACE TERMS DISCUSSED.
Potrograd, Dec. 26.—Discussing the
fisrt forthcoming reply to the peace
proposals, the Rech says:
"The official reply cannot state that,
the Entente allies' aim to bring the
Turkish empire to an end in order to
remove forever German aims of world
dominion, or that the allies will de­
mand reorganization of Austria-Hun
garq in order to make impossible the
fulfillment of German ideas regarding
Central Europe, which forms the first
step in progress for world power."
ITALY NOT AFFECTED.
(Associated Press)
Rome, Dec. 26—The feeling of peace
in the air has not affected in the slight­
est measure Italy's military activities.
The new class, those born in 1898, has
been called to report to the colors
January 1, which will considerably in­
crease the contingent available for
the front, while 2,500 factories are
running day and night turning out
arms ad munitions.
But at the peaks of Tretino, to the
shores of the Adriatic, Christmas pass­
ed in vigilant watching, varied in some
spots by sudden attacks, not unmixed
with fearful weather conditions. Snow

Washington, Dec. 26.—That the
United iStates intends to sit in at the
world's ipeace conference whenever
that may :be held, is the outstanding
significance of President Wilsons ad­
dress to the powers.
This address is an anomaly in the
diplomatic world. It is neither offi­
cial nor unofficial. It is like a good

situation it established a new prece­
dent.
Old Method.
Mediation used to tbe the method
by which warring powers got togeth­
er. A powerful neutral nation would
serve as a medium through which
the warring powers would match up
their ideas as to settlement. This is
what took place when Roosevelt got
the (Russian and Japanese ambassa­
dors together as a preliminary' to the
Portsmouth conference, which work­
ed out the details of the peace be­
tween these nations.
Deals Directly.
Theoretically ambassadors of war­
ring nations do not speak to each oth­
er and thoretically there is no com­
munication 'between warring nations.
That tradition and make-believe have
broken doiwn. Germany smashed it
the other day by dealing directly with
her enemies.
The German offer of peace was as
unusual in the diplomatic world as a
flash of lightning out of a summer
sky. Such a thing never had been be­
fore. It was a recognition that the

Paris, Dec. 26.—French soldiers»cel
ebrated Christmas with the absolute
conviction that they will spend Christ­
mas 1917 at their own homes.
On the Somme, recent victories,
these men think, will make "peace on
earth, good will toward men," an ab­
solute certainty. At Belfort, the
French soldiers spent Christmas de­
fending their first line trenches against
German attacks.
There the older men in the trenches
think their age will give them a super­
iority over the enemy.
Hundreds of. regimental letter car­
riers worked overtime distributing
mail in the trenches and made them­
selves veritable Santa Clauses. Min­
isters delivering Christmas morning
sermons said that fighting might be
necessary to carry out Christian ideals
when fighting was done against those
who had made the carrying out of
Christian ideals impossible.

Steamer Maryland Reported
Sinking About 380 Miles Off
Sandy Hook
NATIONALITY OF CRAFT
NOT KNOWN AS YET
(Associated Press)
New York, Dec. 20.—The coastwise
steamship City of Savanna and the
coast gu:ud cutter Acu.shet, today hur­
ried to the assistance of the steamship
Maryland which wired shortly after
midnight, stating thai she was sink­
ing and asking immediate aid. The
Maryland gave her position at about
oSO miles east of Sandy Hook.
Wireless Out of Commission.
Since the first call for help, which
was picked up by wireless stations in
this city and at the naval station at
Newport News, R. I., no further word
has been received from the Maryland,
and it is believed the vessel's wireless
has been put out of commission, ow­
ing to the flooding of the engine room,
and consequent lack of power.
Two of Same Name.
Although two steamships named
Maryland are listed in the maritime
register, one a British vessel of 2,962
tons, and the other an American of
1,892 tons, it is believed it is the lat­
ter vessel in distress off the coast. The
American ship left Philadelphia Dec.
23 for London with a cargo of oil,
iron pipe, paper and miscellaneous
merchandise. She was owned by the
New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk
Railroad company.
Philadelphia, Dec. 26.—The steam­
er, Maryland, which sailed from here
last Saturday for London, and is re­
ported sinking, is owned by the Crew
Levik company of this city, and for
years was engaged in trade on the
Great Lakes. She was brought here
last September from the lakes and
overhauled for the transatlantic trade.
The Maryland is 31® feet long, 42
feet beam, and has a depth of 20
feet. She carried a crew of 34.
FOUR TO AID.
(United Press)
New York, Dec. 26.—Four vessels
were today rushing to the aid of the
steamship Maryland, believed to be
the American registered vessel by
that name, which is sinking off Sandy
Hook.
Wireless dlispatches today said that
tlie Maryland's engine room is being
flooded. She carried a cargo of oil,
iron and paper. The scene of the re­
ported sinking is in the vicinity of the
recent activities of the U-53.
So serious has the coast guard ser­
vice grown to consider the plight of
the steamer Maryland that the cutter
Greshan has been ordered to her re­
lief.
NO INFORMATION.
(United Press)
Philadelphia, Pa., Dec. 26.—Phil Le­
vik & Company, reported owners of
the steamer Maryland, said they did
not have any information from their
Maryland, but that they thought it
was the British Maryland, not theirs,
in danger.
NO
WORD RECEIVED.
(Uited Press)
Boston, Dec. 26.—The difficulties of
locating the Maryland will be increas­
ed unless she C3n inform her search­
ers of her location, maritime men to­
day said. Nothing had been received
from her here, it was said this after­
noon.

Washington, Dfec. 26.-—The

the response argues well toward
