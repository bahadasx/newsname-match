Dr. Ritter was concerned over
newspaper reports that the action of

Messages from individuals and or

PEACE NOW MEANS
DEFEAT OF ALLIES
RUSSIAN PAPER SAYS NONE
THE ENTENTE AIMS ARE
REALIZED.
OF
Petrograd, Dec. 24, Sunday, via Lon
don, Dec. 26.—(Delayed)—Discussing
the forthcoming reply to the peace
proposals, the Rech says:
"The official reply cannot state that
the entente allies aim to bring the
Turkish empire to an end in order to
remove forever German aims of world
dominion, or that the allies will de
mand reorganization of Austria-Hun
gary in order to make impossible the
fulfillmient of German ideas regarding
central Europe which form the first
step of their program for world power.
Diplomacy cannot suggest these terms
until the allies have laid the firm
foundation for success of their pres
ent military tasks. But by saying less,
diplomacy would acknowledge a result
of the war unsuccessful for the allies.
"Italy has not occupied Trieste,
France has not created a firm frontier
U.
S.
along the Rhine. England has not sisted that the agreement must either
destroped the German fleet nor have be ratified or definitely repudiated,
the allies as a whole succeeded in crip- In the event that Carranza agrees to
pling the German land forces and the terms o£ the protocol it is expect-
therefore there are no guarantees for
the future in national relations which
will free the world from the oppres
sion of militarism."
The Rech says that even if Germany
should make the unexpected conces
sion of relinquishing territorial gain
and restoring ante-bellum' conditions,
the aims of the allies would not be ful
filled and that the only terms accept
able to Russia would be those dictated
by herself and her allies.
SEA FIGHTERS MEET
Austrian* Report Sinking Of Several
Enemy Vessels In An Engage-
Berlin, Dec. 26. (By Wireless to Say
ville)— Two allied patrol boats were
sunk and four other allied warships
were damaged in the recent naval en*
gagement in the strait of Otranto. the
Austrian admiralty announces. Two
Austrian destroyers were hit.
The announcement says:
"On the night of December 22-23
four Austro-Hungarian destroyers
made a raid on the Otranto strait and
after an engagement sank two armed
petrol boats. On their way back at
least six hostile destroyers of greater
size and speed evidently of the Indom

which was one vessel of a more power

"One of our destroyers was hit
twice in the funnel and another was
hit in the superstructure. One man
was killed. There were no wounded."
The Indomito class consists of ten
Italian destroyers 239 feet long, armed
with one 4.7 inch gun and four 12
pounders. The official Italian account
of this engagement, received last night
said two French, destroyers and one
Italian patroj 'boat were damaged

PEACE1^6TE~NOT
WELL INTERPRETED
London, Dec. 26.—Professor A. F.
Pollard, who holds the chair of Eng
lish history in London university,
writes to the Times urging that while
it is clear that somebody blundered
regarding the phraseology and pre
sentation of President Wilson's note,
it is also clear that the people here
are also blundering in interpreting it
"We have to remember," writes
Professor Pollard, "that it is ad
dressed to our enemies as well as to
ourselves and has therefore to ob
serve the diplomatic conventions and
to assume the sincerity of enemy pro
fessions. Secondly, we should re
member our own procedure before the
war. We addressed an Identical in
quiry respecting German neutrality to
France and Germany. France* gave
prompt and satisfactory assurances.
Germany evaded the question and in
vaded Belgium.
"Immediate war between the United
States and ourselved is out of the
question, because we are bound by a
recent treaty to a cooling off period
of not less than a year. Germany re
fused that restraint and the imme

DUTCH OFFENDED
BY GERMAN REPLY
Amsterdam,. Dec. 26 (Via London)—
The Telegraaf says it has reason to
believe that Germany's reply to Hol
land's note regarding the deoortation
of Belgian workmen is framed in such
terms that it was inadvisable to com
municate it to the Dutch parliament,
and that-the government has request
ed Berlin to alter the reply in such a
manner that it may be presented to
the parliament.
The Dutch government last month
instructed its Berlin representative to
notify Germany that the Belgian de
portations had caused a painful im
press'on in Holland. Rotterdam dis

telephone service was interrupted for
more than two hours by a break at

New York, Dec. 26.—The coastwise
steamship City of Savannah and the
coast guard cotter Acushnet, today
hurried to,the assistance of the steam
ship Maryland, which shortly after
midnight sent out messages stating
that she was sinking and asking im
mediate aid. The Maryland gave her
position as latitude 39, longitude 67,
or about 380 miles east of Sandy
Hook.
Since the first call for help, which
was picked up by wireless stations in
ut,
Newport. R. I., no further word was
received from the. Maryland, and it
was believed that the vessel's wire
less had been put out of commission
owing to the flooding of the engine
room and the consequent lack of
power.
Although two steamships named
Maryland are listed in the maritime
register, one a British vessel of 2,96?
tons, and the other an American of
1,892 tons, it Is believed that the lat
ter is the vessel in distress off the

a cargo of oil and iron pipe, paper
and miscellaneous merchandise. She
is owned by the New York, Phila

PORTO RICO USED
FOR WAR TRAFFIC
San Juan, Dec. 20.—(Correspond

Rico has bqpn used as a base of sup

Santo Domingo, in the belief of U. S.
officials here who recently discovered
and confiscated a large quantity of re
volver and rifle shells concealed in
barrels of codfish and destined for the
neighboring republic.
Two arrests were made following
the confiscation of the ammunition but
when a grand jury investigation fol
lowed it was discovered that although
the smuggling of ammunition into
Santo Domingo was prohibited that
there was no punishment provided by
the law prohibiting it.
Daring the administration1 of Presi

joint .resolution authorizing the pres
ident to issue a proclamation forbid

into Santo Domingo but the proclama

EARNINGS OF RAIL
ROADS SET RECORD
TRANSPORTATION LINES OF THE
COUNTRY HAVE UNPRECE
DENTED PROSPERITY.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 26.—More
than $1,000,000,000 net income from
operations was earned by the rail
roads of the country during the year
now closing. The huge total is the
peak of prosperity in railroad opera
tions and stands more than one-third
higher than the total of 1913, hitherto
the banner year.
Statistics gathered by the interstate
commerce commission, complete for
nine months and made the basis for
calculation for the entire year, indi
cate that the total net income from
operations will be approximately fl,
098,000,000. For the first nine months
of the year complete returns show
$785,558,266. Even this does not rep
resent the fun amocmt, as roads whose
income is less than $1,000,000 are not
included.
The estimate—$1,098^)00,000—is re
garded by officials as conservative. It
makes no allowance for normal in
crease in business during the last
three months of the year—returns for
whieh are unavailable—but places the
income for October, November and
December at the same figures as for
July, August and September.
Data for Nine Months.
Analysis of the returns' for the first
nine months shows a startling in
crease from January to September,
amounting to more than 67 per cent.
Thus, net income in January. $84,915,
206. bad mounted to $107^910,814 in
September, an increase of nearly $43,
000,000.
For the first nine months of the year
the commission's figures show that
the railroad^ collected $2,654,829,647
from all sources of operation, the
chief items of which were as follows:
Freight. $1,875,019,990 passenger traf
fic, $522403,907: mails, $45,348,609
from .express companies, $65,089,474
incidentals—dining and buffet car ser
vice. operation of hotels and restau
rants. sale of vending privileges on
trains and at stations, parcel rooms at
stations, demurrage, storage of freight
and baggage, telegraph and telephone
wires leased to other companies, oper
ation of grain elevators, etc.—$60,414,
597, and all other transportation
charges, $76,087,611.
This total, using the first nine
months as a basis, will reach $3,600.
640,502 when the year closes, officials
estimate, and without doubt will ex
ceed it. Never before in the history
of railroad operations have the roads
had so great a gross income.
Expenses Fall Behind Pace.
Expenses have not kept pace with
the rapid rise in receipts, although
they have measurably increased.
From a total of $182,881,269 in Janu
ary expenses had increased to $203,
235,394 in September, approximately
11 per cent. During that period re
ceipts had increased fro^n $260,054,300
to $324,954,302, approximately 25 per
cent.
On the same basis the year's ex
penses will approximate $2,346,066,990,
leaving net revenue from operations
$1,254,573,512. From the last figure,
however, must be deducted the rail
roads' annual tax bill, approximately
$155,625,546 and bad debts—down on
the books as uncollectable revenue—
approximating $965,928, a total of
$156,591,474.
About 230,000 miles of railroad
were in operation during the year. In
the first months the total fell below
230,000 during the latter part of the
year it exceeded 230,000. Using 230,
000 as an average, returns show that
for every mile of road operated in the
country the railroads will receive this
year approximately $15,655 in gross re
ceipts and a net income of $4,774. or a
little more than 30 per cent of the
gross.
ARMING OF SHIPS
PROVIDES PROBLEM
Washington. D. C„ Dec. 26—The re
ports that Great Britain contemplates
shipping American supplies hereafter
from Halifax attracted much attention
in German circles.
This was considered in connection
with the recent demand of Lord North
cliffe that all merchant ships be ai^m
ed fore and aft for fighting submarines.
This would mean that sach ships no
longer could ent^r ports of the United
States. It is thought probable that
Great Britain would convoy them with
destroyers.
This development, it is argued, should
give the American government no con
cern. On the contrary, it should be
hailed with delight and relief.
The only possible effect it could have
in practical operation would be to re
move submarine warfare from its pres-!
ent scope of endangering all ships.
Such activities probably would be di
rected then against vessels plying be
tween Canada and other British ports.
