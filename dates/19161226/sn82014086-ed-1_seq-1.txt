THROB OF GOOD CHEER
FOR MEN IN TRENCHES
To All the British-Armies in -the-Uat-tls
Lines of France
With the British Armies in France,
Dec. 25, via London, 6:45 p. m. (From
a Staff Correspondent of The Associat
de Press) Christmas has sent a throb
of good cheer to ail the British armies
In the battle lines of France, and wher
ever a British soldier ate his Christ
mas dinner today, whether in the front
fire trenches or in the secluded secur
ity of the reserve camps, enthusiastic
toasts were offered to King and Em
pire and to the coming year, - which
Britons confidently believe will bring
victory to the allied cause.
The' soldiers from overseas, the Ca
nadians, Australians, New Zealanders
and South Africans, drank wistfully to
the folks at home, but soon shook
away any tendency to homesickness in
the sturdy work of war, for war, grim
and determined, went forward today as
relentlessly as yesterday and as it will
tomorrow.
The Christmas carols, which rose up
from all parts of the world were not
far enough this year to muffle the roar
of angry guns or shut out the unceas
ing, song of flying shells.
It was Christmas of bounteous plenty
along the British front and the sol
diers in the field were Joyously immune
fro mthe three course dinners prescrib
ed for the British Isles. Each individ
ual company of vast army o realiza
tion had a jubilant Christmas spread
and monetary, and the canteens nd
elaborateness of the camp menus.
The members of the various com
panies pooled their assets, both edible
and monetary, and the' canteeens and
samll French shops which persist and
prosper in the war zone were called
out for all their sweets and delicacies.
Mess halls were splendidly decorated
in man cases holy and mistletoe and
paper flowers made by the soldiers
themselves, most of the, flowers being
made into Christmas mottoes. The
Young Men's Christian Association and
other organizations provided entertain
ments. Where conditions permitted, as
tiany of the men as possible were re
ieved from front line duty for din
ner, steaming not, was carried up
tnrougn me communication trenhces,
some times under the pelting of shells,
to the men held by duty at the outposts
of war.
Some- of the men serving the big
guns cnaiKea satiric greetings on the
shells befor firing thm. "If it's a dud
shell and doesn't explode," exclaimed a
gnner, 'Brother Boche can -. read
what we think of him."

Increase in the Cost of - Coal. Track
' Material and Rolling Stock.
Paris, Dec. 25. Increase in the cost
of coal, track material and rolling
stock nave added so to operating ex
withstanding a considerable increase in
receipts since 1914, they show a deficit
of 715,000,000 francs for the two fiscal
years following the outbreak of war.
The principal lines spent two billion
francs in the year 1915-1916; they re
ceived 1,700,000. For the fiscal year
1916-1917, the anticipated outlay is 2
500,000,000. An increase of seventeen
per cent, in receipts is expected, but
this will stand to lave a deficit of 455.
OOOjOOO for the yearr
An idea of what coal prices mean to
the railroads is seen in the fact that
the Paris-Lyons and Mediterranean
lines spent 56,000,000 francs for coal in
1913 and 170,000,000 francs in 1916.
Steel rails that cost 180 francs a ton
before the war have gone up to 550
francs. Railroad ties cost 122 per cent,
more, locomotives are 0 per cent,
higher and are going on toward a 100
per' cent, increase, while cars have
gone up from 200 per cent, to 300 per
cent, since 1913.
The defiicit of the state railroads was
76 millions in 1914; it is estimated at
206 millions for the current fiscal year.

NATHAN STRAUS TO HEAD
AMERICAN-JEWISH CONGRESS
Elected Permanent Chairman
Compromise Candidate.
New York, Dec 26. After a heated
meeting here tonight of the executive
committee of 140 for an American
Jewish congress, Nathan Straus of
this city was elected permanent chair
man, as a ' compromise candidate.
Washington ;Was chosen as the place
for, the holding of the forthcoming
Jewish congress. The date probably
will not be later than 'May 1 next.
At the meeting tonight, the first of
theexecutlve committee thus far held,
two factions, representing opposite
views as to the purpose of the forth
coming congress, called for a vote on
their sitrengih. Several lively . tilts
occurred between the members ;when
the nominating committee recommend
ed Adolph Kraus. grand master of the
Independent Order B'Nai B'Rith, to be
permanent chairman. A minority re
port submitted by Cyrus L. Sulzberger
of New York "deplored the fact that
the committee had decided to nomi
nate as permanent chairman a man
who is at the head of an international
secret order." The reading" of this re
tort caused an uproar in the hall. In
the confusion Henry- Morgenthau, for
mer ambassador to Turkey, took the
chair and implored the members to
forget "petty differences."
Mr. Kraus, who gained the floor, de
nied that his organization is a secret
one and added that the rituals had
not been forwarded to the Russian
and other governments. He suggested.
however, that it would-be better for
him and Louis Marshall, candidate of
the faction opposed to Mr. Kraus, to
step aside in the interest of harmony.
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise then nominated
Mr. Straus, whose election was made
unanimous.
The committee divided on the ques
tion of placing the subject of con
etructive relief for Jews abroad on
the program of the congress. An
amendment was carried which de
clared that it was "deemed advisable
to place on the agenda of the con
gress the subject of the economic re
construction of the Jewish 'communi
ties in the war zone."

overturned on the beach today. All

a widow and two children, living in
tsiacK kock. .
The assistant, it was learned, saw
Jordan's boat swamped, and started to
his assistance in another boat- The
wind and the waves were so strong,
however, that he was forced to turn
back, and had a hard time reaching
the light. Afterward he was unable
to communicate with the shore. The
Bridgeport harbor master and a light
house keeper from New York tried to
reach the light today in a tug, but
were unable to do so because of the
waves breaking over the reef. They
got what faces they , could from the
assistant by using megaphones while
the tug bobbed up and down In the
seas, and then steered hastily away
from the danger zone.

DR. ARTHUR WAITE HAD
SECRETED BOTTLE OF POISON

for the Former's Arrest.
New York, Dec. 25. That Dr. Arthur
Waite, awaiting execution in Sing Sing
prison for the murder of his wealthy
father-in-law, John E. Peck of Grand
Rapids, had confessed to his brother,
Frank Waits, that he had secreted a
bottle containing poison in Frank
Waite's home shortly berofe his ar
rest was disclosed In a statement is
sued here tonight by the condemned
man's brothers.
Dr. Waite is quoted as saying that
he brought this poison with him sev
eral years ago from South Africa,
where he had been employed by a den
tal supply concern. If he had used
the South Africa poison instead of pur
chasing a quantity of the poison from
lecal dealers to kill Mr. Peck. Frank
Waite asserts that the authorities here
probably would not have been able to
trace the crime to Dr. Waite. This
oversight, the "brother contends, is of
itself proof that Dr. .Waite is not the
confirmed criminal he has . beep
described but that he is Insane.
" Frank ..Waite asserted this evidence
would be presented to the court of ap
peals in an effort to, obtain a new trial

Celebration at Field Headquarters.
It was at field headquarters, where
the greatest number of troops are en
camped that the most elaborate cele
brations were held from early morning
when the bands played carols, instead
of the bugles sounding reveille, until
taps, when the throng about the
Christmas tree -began to break up.

DUST SMOTHERED GREAT
.. CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION
At Field Headquarters of American
Puntive Expedition in Mexico
Feld Headquarters, Punitive Expe
dton in Mexico, Dec. 25. Dust smoth
ered the great Christmas celebration at
the field headquarters of the American
punitive expedition. A terrifflc gale
from the west drove officers into ther
quarters and soldiers into their little
shelters, gasping for breath. Swirling
down the chimneys of "the - adobe
shacks, it sent the occupants into the
open air until the fires in the grates
could be extinguishid, the smoke
cleared out and the shelters " recon
structed. Trees Were Uprooted.
Trees were uprooted, adobe housec
and officers quarters unroofed and
kitchen fires blown out.
Because of the games every man was
not on guard was allowed to seek
Shelter from the dust. Oderlies, sent
out with messages, became lost in the
Hints of the camp and took an hour
to walk a thousand yards. Travel
Without dust goggles was impossible.
Hundreds of Men Hurt.
. Hundreds of men are hurt, who, not
realizing the force of the wind, ven
tured into the open only to see their
headgear swept away over the Mesa.
The quarters camp appeared as a great
blur.
Sunlight Could Not Pierce Dust.
Although the day was cloudless, hard
ly a ray of sunlight pierced the open
ing dust.
Most of the offices were lighted by
gasoline and lanterns.
Bands Heard Only in Snatches.
The wind rose Christmas eve and in
creased 'in violence-steadily. By day
light, the music of the bands, which
played carols instead of buglers sound
ing reveille, was heard only in snatch
es. General John J. Pershing directed
the effort of a score of oderlies to save
his living quarters from being blown
away.
It was impossible to see more than
three feet in any direction for hours
at a time. Two artillerymen were in
jured by falling adobe walls, one had
leg broken, the other a hip.
