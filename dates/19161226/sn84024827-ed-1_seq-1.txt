For. the first time In many, many

sight it was to many people; stranger
still to others: the former, coming

Christmas was made far brighter in

prosperity and happiness, already at

Sunday night the first festivity of

Dust Smothers Great Christmas Celebration
Planned By Pershing's Troops Down In Mexico
(Py Review Leased Wire)
j FIELD HEADQUARTERS. Punitive
Expedition, Mex., Dec. 25. Dust
smothered the great Christmas celebra
tion at the field headquarters of the
American punitive expedition, borne
by a terrific gale from the southeast
whh h divc the soldiers into their
little shelters, gasping for breath.
Never In the memory of the oldest in
habitants of this section had such a
terrific wind prevailed. Swirling down
the chimneys of the adobe shacks, it
sent the occupants Into the open air
until the fires In the grates could be
extinguished, the smoke cleared out
and the shelters rendered habitable.
Tents were flattened, adobe houses
end offices unro'ofed and kitchen flies
blown away.
Because of the gale, every man on
individual company of the vast army
' organization had a jubilant Christmas I
' spread and thorn was much rivalry In
: the elaborateness of the (amp menus.
; The members of the various camps I
j pooled their assets, both edible and
monetary, and the canteens and small
' French shops which persist and pros- 1
I per in the war zone were called on ,
i for ail their sweets and delicacies. ,
i Mess halls were splendidly decorated 1
j in many instances with holly and
mistletoe and paper flowers.
Puddings, Anyway
At various places along the line ;
musicians visited the camps giving i
concerts for the soldiers.. Every Brit-1
ish soldier had his individual pluf
pudding, this particularly indispensi
ble item of the Christmas bill of fare .
having been looked after by the Lon- j
don newspapers which raised in the
neighborhood of L100.000 for their;
purchase.

It was the first snow of the
season and with all the relish of a
newly found ' toy, kiddies and
grown-ups wallowed in the downy
stuff and pelted each other in good
natured fashion. '
Last night a freeze turned the

JUAREZ POLICE CHIEF
IS SLAIN BY OFFICER.
EL PASO, Dec. 25. Shots heard in
Juarez late tonight involving the
death of Raoul Loya, acting chief of
police of the town, and causing the
report to spread here of a garrison
uprising, proved on Investigation to be
due to two murders. Loya, the victim
of one crime, was killed by a Carranza
officer whom he had previously dis
armed. Americans who saw the tra
gedy said the officer was intoxicated.
The second crime was the murder 'of
his wife by a peon laborer.
' guard duty was allowed to seek shelter
from the dust. Orderlies, sent out
with messages, became lost in the
limits of the camp and took an hour
to walk a thousand yards. Travel
without dust goggles was Impossible.
! Hundreds jf men are hatless who, not
realizing the force of the wind, ven
tured into the open only to see their
headgear swept away over the mesa.
The headquarters camp appeared as a
I great blur of dust.
Although the day was cloudless,
hardly a ray of sunlight pierced the
enveloping dust.
Most of the offices were lighted by
gasoline lamps and lanterns.
The wind rose Christmas Eve and
increased in violence stead'ly. By day
light the music of the bands, which
the shells befiije firing them. ' If It's
a dead shell and does not explode, ex
plained a gunner, "the Bocim can read
what we think of him. On the other
hand, if it does explode, he'll know
without reading."
Different Christmas
This, the third Christmas of the
British army in France, was vastly
different from lis two predecessors,
especially the first, when only a piti
ful handful of the orginal expedition
ary force was left to form a thin kha
ki line against the gray-clad enemy.
The field aimy was then so small that
King George personally sent a Christ
mas package to every one. The mul
tiplication of that army of tens of
thousands into the present force of
so many millions has altered the situ
ation. The news of Prchldent Wilson's
peace note wa.i made public through
the army today, but It cannot be said
to have been favorably received.
Whi'e It cannot be truthfully said
thst officers and men alike realize the
hardships of the' coming winter, all
anpecr eager for a new offensive In
the spring and say they can make that
offensive decisive. -

Action Marks Radical Depar

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 25. The
government today took its first
formal step through the fed
eral reserve board, looking to the
establishment of financial condi
tions abroad through which it
hopes to strengthen the position
of the United States and retain
the American dollar as the stand
ard of trade.
Connection with other foreign
governmental institutions, such as
the Bank of France, is foreshad
owed, officials say, by today's act
ion The Bank of England is the first
fcrei?n correspondent whose appoint
ment has been authorized since the
operation of the new financial system
in this country.
To Aid After War
Tn addition to being the first step
by the government toward going after
foreign business It is understood that
the authorization of this appointment
is a prt of plans for the establish
ment of financial connections that will
strengthen the United States as a
creditor nation in the commercial com
petition which probably will result
when the war close, and to provide
a ready means to offset any tendency
on the part of the foreign tankers to
withdraw the huge supply of gold sent
here during the war.
Bold Step
The action marks a radical depart
ure from the previous financial policy
of the country, inasmuch as it pluces
the government of the United States
rnd Great Britain for the first time la
direct, continual financial relation
ship. Will Conserve Gold
The first effect, it is thought, will
be noticeable in transactions which
might otherwise result in the expor
tation of gold from this country, as
the connection with the Bank of Eng
land will afford a channel through
which American banks readily cau
purchase British notes and securities
to meet any tendency toward gold ex
portation. It also will tend, officials
believe, to bring about a better feel
ing and understanding between bank
ers of the two countries. Whether
operations through the connection
will be extensive officials admit is
difficult to forecast. They might he
on a tremendous scale, it was said,
and on the other hand, might be com
paratively light in volume.
The enVct of the relationship prob
ably will be studied carefully before
similar authorizations are made in the
case of other government controlled
banks abroad.
