Berlin. Dec. fJ6. Germany and her
allies Austria-Hiinsury. Bulgaria and
Turkey today replied to the note of
President Wilson, in which he asked
the In inherent nations to .state the
alms for which they were fighting. The
propotl is made 1y the central power-
that a - onffience of the delegates
of all tin? belligerents be held immedi
ately in a neutral city. The task of
preventing future wars, the official
ttateuient says, ran he begun only
after the nd of the present struggle.
The answer, which also contains the
reply of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, says:
The high-minded suggestions made
by the president of the L'nited States
of America in order to create a basis
for the establishment of a lasting
peace, have been received and consid
ered by the imperial government in
the friendly spirit which was ex
pressed in the president's communica
tion. 1
"The president points out that which
he ha at heart and leaves open the
choice of road.
Siiiic-fts Kxclianjrc of Views.
", the imperial government an
immediate exchange of views seems to
be the most appropriate road in order
io reach the desired result.
"It heir, therefore, in the sense of
the declaration made on December 12,
which oftered a hand for peace nego
tiations, to propose an immediate
met -tins of the belligerent states at a
ncuti--tl place.
"The imperial government is" also of
the opinion that the great work of pre
v. nt.ng further wars can he begun
orly afti r the end of the present strug
gle of the nations.
"It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure to
collaborate entirely with the United
States in this exaited task."
The answer of the central powers
concludes with the usual diplomatic
terms of politeness.
Improsioiis In Washington.
Washington, Dec. 26. Hasty exam
ination of Germany's reply to Presi
dent Wilson's peace suggestions, as
contained in dispatches from Berlin,
led one of the foremost administra
tion officials today to Ktate his belief
that the entente allies will not be sat
isfied to meet the Teutonic proposals.
This official declared he is strongly
of the opinion that "the proposals
would be unsatisfactory to the entente
allies insofar as hope of arranging a
peace conference at this time is con
cerned." He expressed the view that the al
lies would not consent to a peace
meeting based on any such answer as
was given in the brief reply by Ger
many. I
He held that Germany had directly
dodged the request of the United
States for something Fpecific in the
way of peace terms.
Would Settle Terms Secretly.
The German answer squared with
Ambassador Bernstorff's recent state
ment that Germany fs willing to state
her terms at a round table session.
Preliminary examination indicated
to administration officials that the en
tente allies will be unwilling to join
such a session unless they can get
something more definite on which to
operate.
AH officials expressed frank pleas
ure over Germany's very immediate,
response to the president's note.
They declare "it augurs well" since
ii means Germany obviously went im
mediately to work on her answer.
While many admitted they were
disappointed at the absence of spe
ciric terms asked for. they pointed out
i hat any peace division at this time
ami for some time to come must of
necessity be prolonged with a consid
erable period, division to be expected
"before the belligerents get right
down to brass tacks."
Otiirials Are Surprised.
Officials here are surprised that
Germany's answer to President Wil
son's peace note was given out. in Ber
lin before it reached this country in
official form. They pointed out that
in sending his note President Wilson
allowed two days between the time of
its despatch and making it public that
it might first reach the German gov
ernment. In the absence of an offi
cial reply, formal comment was with
held at the White House and the state
depH rtment.
The direct proposal for a confer
ence of delegates at a neutral place
was regarded as a further step than
German's proposal altho officials con
sidered it as having been definitely
forecast in the first proffer. Such a
formal offer has repeatedly been men
tioned in authorized statements at the
( ierman embassy here. where the
opinion freely has been expressed that
i 1
if delegates once could be gathered
around a table for the purpose of dis
missing ueace the result surely would :
be an arrangement of terms. j
The Berlin dispatches containing the
German reply were read by President ;
Wilson and Secretary Lansing with the ,
greatest interest. Some otticials who i
compare the reply with President Wil-
son's note, professed to see some con-
ftict between the German statement
that the work of securing the future
peace of the world should be delayed
until the end of the present struggle,
while others were of the opinion that
it was not entirely out of harmony.
TERMS FOR PEACE
Germany Has Forwarded Them
to Xeutral Nations.
Are To Be Delivered to Enemy
Upon Latters Request.
Home, Dec. 26. Germany handed
to the neutral nations whose services
she asked in forwarding peace sugges
tions to her enemies, a sealed packet
containing the specific terms upon
which she was willing to make peace,
according to a report in circulation
here today.
The report had it that this packet
was sent with instructions that it was
only to be read and forwarded to Ger
many's enemies of the entente in case
those powers, answering Germany's
proffers, actually requested terms
Otherwise it was to be returned un
opened. The same report declared in the
case of the note submitted to Pope
Benedict, Germany permitted the holy
father to read this secret list of con
cessions and demands.

Santa Fe engineers today began the
survey of an extension of the rail
way's Holyrood iine from Holyrood,
across the northern part of Barton
county, Kansas, to Galicia. The new
line will be approximately thirty-five
miles long; will run thru one of the
richest wheat producing sections and
most rapidly growing livestock terri
tories in the state, and will be the
fourth Santa Fe line to penetrate Bar
ton county, in the central part of the
state.
The Holyrood line, now about fifty
miles long, leaves the Marion-McPher-son
line of the Santa Fe at Little River
and runs northwest to its present ter
minus, Holyrood, from where the new
extension will be surveyed almost due
west.

Xo Londs are being sought for the
construction of the extension. Actual
construction will begin at an early
date and will be completed as soon as
possible.
Farmers and other producers living
in the northern part of the county
have been working for such a line for
some time that they might be closer to
the main line markets. An idea of the
productive wealth of the territory is
obtained from the fact that the assess
ed valuation of Barton county is $45,
000,000. Santa Fe lines now running into
Barton county are the main line, the
Newton-McPherson branch and the
Scott City branch. The new Santa Fe
line will be the only one traversing the
northern part of the county.

"We are making a careful study of
the processes of marketing butter,
eggs and poultry," said Professor
I Macklin. "We intend to get out a

possible. We want to show what a
complex problem marketing really is
and that these processes are economic
functions which require compensation

want to emphasize the need on the
part of the farmer to lay his emphasis
upon his own door step in the way of
reducing his immediate cost of pro-
duction and to improve quality, both
of which will net him more returns

The same information has already

the state and also from the poultry
and egg dealers.

and on the curb. Many stocks dropped from fifteen to twenty-five points in a

!
Buenos- Aires, Dec. 26. Certain
South American chancellors are tenta-
tively communicating regarding the
dispatch of a note to belligerents
backing up President Wilson's peace
plea forwarded here today. No offi-
cial confirmation was to be obtained.
The report, however, went so far as to
suggesr that the A. B. C (Argentine,
Brazil and Chile) governments were
mainly concerned in the move.
South America has generally ap-
plauded the timeliness of President
Wilson's peace suggestions- and saw in
Secretary Lansing's hints of America
joining a league of nations after the
war to force peace, an opportunity for
a closer pan-Americanism. Lansing
suggested that the I nited States would
first of all feel the desire of joining
with South American nations in any
such plan. '

Boy Escapes Fiend and Baby
Slashed Slay Recover.
Minden, La.. Dec. 26. Three ne
groes were in jail here today, heavily
guarded, charged with the murder of
John N. . Reeves, his wife and two
children at their, farm home, nine
miles from here, yesterday. Every
precaution was being taken to pre
vent mob violence and no person was
permitted to approach within 100 j
yards of the jail. i
The first report of the tragedy was
received when Reeves' seven-year-old
son rushed into a farm house yester
day and said that "all the family are
killed." Neighbors rushed to the
Reeves home and found the farmer
dead in his bed, his head crushed
with an axe and his body covered
with wounds. An eleven-year-old son
lay before the fireplace in another
room, his skull fractured and his arms
and legs slashed. In the boy's arms
was clutched his fifteen months old
brother, bady cut and bruised. In a
third room was a five-year-old boy
alpo badly cut and bruised. He was
dead.
Robbery the Motive.
Members of the Reeves family were
killed by unknown persons evidently
bent on robberv. The victims are:
JOHN NELSON REEVES, aged 65.
MRS. JOHN NELSON REEVES,
aged 30.
DAVID REEVES, son, aged 9.
WOODROW REEVES, son aged 5.
A fifteen-months-old-infant was also
badly iiurt but reports from Shreve
port where the baby was taken for
treatment indicated today that he will
recover.
William Cody Reeeves, aged. 7. an-other-son,
was sleeping at the time the
crime was committeed and evidently
was overlooked by the -slayers. He
know nothing of the tragedy until he
awoke at dawn Monday and discover
ed it.
There seems to be no doubt that
robbery inspired the crime and that
the men respons-ible for it obtained
considerable booty. Mrs. Reeves, it s
said, recently received a legacy of 53,
500, and the money was kept in a
chest on the premises with about $500
that Reeves had saved. The chest was
broken open and its contents taken.
STEAMSHIP SINKING
Four Ships Itusli to Rescue of the
Maryland, 150 Miles Off Coast.
New York, Dec. 26. The steamship
Maryland is reported sinking about
150 miles off Sandy Hook, according
to wireless messages picked up here.
Four vessels are now on their way
to aid the distressed Maryland the
steamship Savannah, the cutter
Acushnet from Boston, the cutter
Seneca from Newport and the cutter
Mohawk, which picked up the distress
-signals at sea.
Wireless messages said the engine
rooms of the Maryland were rapidly
being flooded.
There are two steamships in the
maritime register under the name
Maryland. One of these Is a British
vessel of 2,962 tons and the other is
an American vessel ftf 1.899 tons. The
latter was last reported on December
23, leaving Philadelphia for Liverpool
or London. This is believed to be the
ship in distress.
Carried Valuable Cargo.
The American ship Maryland is
owned by the Xew York, Philadelphia
& Norfolk railroad and when she left
port in Philadelphia on Saturday she
carried a cargo of oil. iron pipes,
fiber, paper and miscellaneous mer
chandise. She last reported her posi
tion as seventy-five miles east of the
Five Fathom bank lightship.
Because her wireless was weak no
messages giving cause of distress
could be interpreted at wireless sta
tion here. The position reported,
however, latitude 39, longitude 67, was
in that region where allied shipping
was recently raided by the Germans.

NEW OFFICE PLAN
Santa Fe Will Build Sew Struc
ture at Ainth and Jackson.
Original Idea of Adding Three
Stories Is Abandoned.
The Santa Fe railway will rebuild
the old office building in Topeka in
stead of adding three stories to the
new structure, according to the pres
ent plans of the management. It is
believed that the work of tearing
down the red brick building at Ninth
and Jackson streets will begin with
the opening of spring. A new $350,
000 fireproof office building will be
built in its place.
The original plan as announced in
the State Journal several weeks ago
was to add three stories to the ten
story general office building built a
few years ago, making the structure
thirteen stories in height. The expen
diture was authorized and plans were
completed by the engineering depart
ment. Following Vice President Storey's
visit to Topeka a short time ago, in
which he announced the ultimate con
struction of a new building at Ninth
and Jackson streets, it was planned to
abandon the thirteen story idea and
rebuild the old builciing at the Ninth
Jackson corner.
The work on the new shops an
nounced by Vice President Storey has
not been determined upon. The vice
president's promise of a new Santa Fe
station is still an undetermined fea
ture. A COLD WAVE COMING

NO PEACE NOV

CABINETMEMBER
To Accept Offer Would Place
Nations in Bondage.
Arthur Henderson Addresses
French Socialists.
WAR'S MOST CRITICAL PERIOD
Anticipates 3rany Months More
of Sacrifices.
Xo Peace Until End of War
Forever Assured
Paris, Dec. 26. In addresses at tti
national congress of the French So
cialist party." Arthur Henderson, the
British cabinet minister, and G. H.
Roberts, member of the British parlia
ment, both affirmed amidst enthusi
astic encores that the war must bo
fought out until full guarantees have
been obtained for a lasting peace.
"In my opinion," said Mr. Hender
son, "if France and ourselves were to
enter into negotiations under existing
conditions, we should be nations in
bondage. Nothing less than that is th
price our enemies would exact for
peace today."
Enul Vandervelde, the Belgian So
cialist leader. s1d:
"Our comrades who have remained
in invaded Belgium have endured Ger
man dominion with admirable firm
ness. Nothing but encouragement
reaches us from them. Ho that it
would seem that the people most hos
tile to war are those farthest from it.'"
M. Vandervelde also declared that
the struggle must be carried on until
Belgium and Serbia are delivered and
"Caesarism is laid low."
In his speech Mr. Henderson said:
"In my opinion we have now reached
the most dangerous and difficult
period of the war. During the next
few months the democracies of Eng
land and France are going to bo
tested as never before. Do not misun
derstand me. 4 do not mean stress
and strain of fighting in the field will
be more severe, altho I do not ignore
such a possibility, but the danger is of
entirely a different character.
Would Not "Mortjcngo the Future.
"Our stupendous losses, our unprec
edented sacrifices, our horror of war,
our love of peace, may lead us to
mortgage the future. With such. aw.,
rill-experiences we are ept to forget
the great moral and eternal princi
ples and ideals for which we enter
ed the struggle. We are not only
fighting a negative action against ma
terial forces which are highly organiz
ed but we are engaged in a great spir
itual conflict upon the result of which
depend all our great ideals.
"If we enter into negotiations now
we do so when Germany is not re
pentent for her wrong doing and is
glorifying in the success of hr n.oi
Ltary efforts in fact, in the victory of
jeiiiiH.n imperialism. Jn my opin
ion if France and ourselves "were to
enter into negotiations under existing
conditions with such a spirit wo
should be nations in bondage. Noth
ing less than that is the price whiclt
our enemy would exact for peace to
day. "I cannot tell you how manv months
and what sacrifices stand between us
and victory. But 1 can tell you what
will be the rewards of victory if we are
true to ourselves. We shall have as
serted the rights of nations, large or
small, to live their own lives undis
turbed by the ambitions of pov.errul
neighbors. We shall have exacted Hucit
reparation for wrongs, done them by
this war as will be warning to aggres
sors for all time to tome. We shall
have laid foundations for that leiioo
of nations, beginning with those who
have fought and suffered at our side,
which will deliver Kurope and tho
world from the terror of war.
Peace Now t ntilm-ly.
"The choice today is between an un
timely peace with yenrs of frar and a
few months of suffering with a last
ing peace. Taking Into consideration
all the consequences of the decision I
say now as in August. 1914. both na
tions are presented with the choice as
between honor and family. The choico
is more sacred now as the cause has
been sealed by the blood of our heroic
dead. We in Britain feel to mako
peace now. to think of pea?e at anr
time with less than full indemnity for
the past and full security for the fu
ture, would be to dessert our allies and
betray the hopes of freedom thruout
the world.
"We hate war. It N brutal, the ne
gation of everything for which wo
stand. Therefore, we must prevent Its
recurrence so far as is in our power.
We desire to see the democracies of
the world free to progress to their
highest ideals. To accomplish this,
we must stand together for the des
truction of militarism, the vindication
of national right and liberty, the pnn
ishment of national wrong. Be tho
nations large or small, they must bo
free."
