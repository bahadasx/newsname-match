GOOD NEWS FOR GOLFERS
Report of the Death of James Braid
the Scotch Professional Proves
to be Erroneous
(Associated Press)
New York, Dec. 2G. Followers of
golf throughout' the United States
and Canada will be glad to learn that
the reported death of James Braid,
the famous Scotch professional, was
based upon a case of mistaken iden
tity and that Braid is very much
alive and looking forward to the time
when conditions abroad will permit
him to visit this country and play in
a series of exhibition matches.
Early in the month a short dispatch
from London announced that James
Braid, the famous golfer, 'had been
killed while 'boarding a moving train
in the Waterloo station. It further
stated that Braid had been thrown
backwards from the train and had
died on the way to the hospital, ap
parently from a fractured skull. The
report was given wide publicity and
it was not until recently that it was
learned that the man killed was not
the open champion' of 1901-5-6-8-10.
The Jame3 Braid who was killed In
the manner described was a profes
sional golfer employed by the South
sea Club and so far as .known no
relative to the James Braid who with
Ray, Vardon, J. II. Taylor and one or
two other players, stand out as the
most famous exponents of the ancient
and honorable game.

The Americans, in refusing the coun

that an answer would be expected to

where virtually only the artillery was
active and the men were feasted and

pation of Tultcha.
British moutned troops with the co
operation of aircraft carried a strong
position at , Maghdaba, twenty miles
distant from El Arish, which was cap

OYSTERS BEING EATEN
IN THEIR SHELLS
Voracious Little Fish Making Great
Inroads on the Bivalves
(Times-Union) '
The oyster bar at Port Inglis has
practically been destroyed and serious
injury has been done the bars at Tam
pa and Cedar Key bythe leech, a
small free swimmer which has recent
ly made its appearance on the West
Coast, according to T. R. Hodges,
state shellfish commissioner, who
spent yesterday at Hotel Mason, while
enroute to Tallahassee, where he is
to spend the Christmas holidays with
his family.
The commissioner has just return
ed from a tour of inspection of this
pest and he has sent specimens to the
bureau of fisheries at Washington
with the request that the government
send a man here to continue the inves
tigation with a view to finding some
means of getting rid of the fish.
"The leech has been found near
Tampa, Port Inglis and as far north
a3 Cedar Key," he said. "The Port
Inglis bar has practically been des
troyed by them and if they get up to
Apalachicola they will damage the in
dustry to the extent of several hun
dred thousand dollars.
"This pest is a kind of small fish
of a brownish color on the back and
white on the belly. In size they vary
from the size of a shirt button to an
irch in length. They enter the mouth
of the oyster and practically eat him
alive. In many cases two or three
of them will be found feeding from
the same oyster. "
A NARROW ESCAPE
Mr. F. W. Webber, who was the
victim of an accident that came near
being fatal several days ago, is now
doing nicely.
He was working around the cold
storage plant on Thursday afternoon
when his clothes caught in a revolv
ing shaft. Only his presence of mind
in grasping a belt and allowing the
machinery to tear his clothing from
his bodyQsaved his life. He lost two
fingers and was otherwise badly
bruised about the body. His recovery
was for a time doubtful, but a report
from him today indicates that he will
pull through all right, much to the
gratification of his friends and neigh
bors. All kinds of seed for fall garden

The booster week announcement in
yesterday's issue of the Star has
caused considerable excitement x and
generated a lot of enthusiasm among
the members of the 3,000 Club who
are getting in line for. their share of
the $2,080 in cash and prizes which
the Star is going to distribute on Jan.
20th.
Here is something real and tangi
ble to work for a mark by which to
guage your efforts. With every club
of $10 in subscriptions you turn in for
the Evening Star, you will receive
85,000 extra votes. With every club
of $7.50 in one-year weeklies, you will
receive 15,000 extra votes. With every
club of $15 you turn in for five-year
weeklies you will receive 250,000 ex
tra votes. All these extra votes are
in addition to the regular votes print
ed on the back of your slips.
This offer, while not quite as large
as that of last week,1 still affords you
a good chance to pile up thousands of
votes between now and the close next
Saturday night. After that time the
vote schedule will be reduced again
and " so. on down until the last" week
when votes will be scarce.
If you are now a member of the
3,000 Club, your aim should be high
enough to include getting in several
of these clubs under the present offer.
Of course there are some of you who
will think that this is said to boost
the Star, but there is another reason
than this. It is a mutual reason
you need the votes and we need the
readers. But there is another reason.
By starting now, you get the percent

SILVER SPRINGS
Is One of the Most Useful as Well!
the Most Beautiful Attributes
of Ocala
Hernando de Soto discovered Sill
ver Springs in A. D. 1539, but we do
not believe the people of Ocala really
discovered it until the summer of
1916, tho of course most of them
were aware in a general way that it
was there.
The only reason they discovered it
then was "that Ed. Carmichael put up
a big bathhouse and did other things
to make it a very pleasant place for
them to go to. Its dollars to dough-

bris, thus making both the wood Mr. Carmichael .won't build the
nymphs and the water nymphs grieve,
and finally driving them away.
So . Silver Springs remained the
better part of a century, its rare
beauty asserting itself against neg
lect, observed by almost every visitor
but disregarded by most of those at
home.
In the last few years, Mr. Carmich
ael has been improving the surround
ings to the springs, and in the last
two, he has (or he says his wife has)
been trying to beautify them, and al
though the work ' has been against
considerable disadvantages and dis
couragement, there is almost as much
difference between the Silver Springs
cr today and the Silver Springs of a
quarter of a century ago as there was
between the Silvef Springs of 1890
and the Silver Springs of 1539.
What strikes the eye most impres
sively is cutting out the undergrowth
or. the north side of the river. The
Star reporter stood the other day in
the pavilion and looked east along the
river and reflected to himself that
there was then a more unobstructed
view down the stream than there had
been at any time since the day prob
ably tens of thousands of years ago,
when the new vegetation rising from
the soil first clad the banks of the
river in green. This is going to
make a very great attraction, and will
be better appreciated by our home
folks who know how it has looked up
to the last few weeks, and can soon
see the entire silver band of the river
to the point1 where it looks like it
falls over the rim in its rush down
thru the canon of the cypress walls
toward the Oklawaha.
In the last few weeks, Mr. Carmi
chael, beside having this underbrush
cut out has had the low places on the
eastern side of the spring filled with
clean sand, which the Oklawaha-Val
ley railroad has patriotically hauled
in for him. The old Robinson boat-
house, which stood on the little point
at that side has been removed. These
three things make a wonderful im
provement, and clearing out of brush
and filling in of the low places is go
ing on until all that side clear down
to the end of the springs has been
improved.
The low place to the north of the
railroad will also be cleared and filled
up, and level, healthy ground will

f hotel just yet, but he does like to look
v
over the magnificent ground and ex
plain it to an appreciative friend
and why we should-not all be his ap
preciative friends on thi3 line is
something difficult to understand.
But while he thinks and talks of
what should be and may be, Ed.
works at what is and can be. As we
all know,- he has little help and con
siderable hindrance in carrying put
his plans, but he has fought onward
and gone a considerable way toward
making Silver Springs a- river, port
and pleasure-park for Ocala.
Last year, Mr. Carmichael had the
low ground on this side of the spring
cleared and filled, making quite . a
nice park. Then he put up a neat
and roomy building with many dress
ing rooms for the accomodation 'of
people who wanted to bathe, and had
it ready for them at. the beginning of
the season. It took greatly, and al
most every summer afternoon and
evening, there were from scores to
hundreds of people either in swim
ming or watching the swimmers. It
was then that Ocala really discovered
Silver Springs.
This last season was a great suc
cess, and Mr. Carmichael is going to
make the next one more so. He has
cleared away the old pavilion at the
water's edge, and built further back
from the shore a new one of two
stories. The upper story is a danc
ing floor, and he will be glad to see
it filled every weekday evening next
summer.-
He is now having the old freight
warehouse removed, and when that is
done, the shore will be clear of all the
shabby structures that have partly
obscured it. He has an adequate elec
tric plant, and in a short time the
shores and waters' of the springs will
be illuminated by this best of lights.
In the meantime, he has been pre
paring for the tourist business, of
which he has good promise for this
season. That swift and elegant little
beat, the "City of Ocala," has been
overhauled, and will leave on her first .
trip for Palatka Monday, Jan. 8. She
has a good passenger list booked, and
will make three round trips a week.
The bigget, newer boat,jthe Silver
Springs, is being greatly improved.
