KAISER ASKS PEACE MEETING
****** ****** ****** ******
HUNT ON FOR BILLINGSLEY HIGHER-UPS
ROLL UP YOUR
SHIRT SLEEVES
Nonpartisanship will sink or survive
by just the amount of help Seattle men
and women will give it the next two days.
If you have any red blood in you—you
will fight to the last ditch.
Already, all the crooks and grafters in
politics, the cheap political ward heelers,
those who make the public treasury their
private loot, arc smirking and snickering
in glee because they think they have
smothered nonpartisanship.
Arc vou content with that?
Chief Registration ("lerk Gaines makes
it possible to continue the campaign for
signatures up to 6 p. m. Thursday. Don't
give up the ship! Let us tight to the last
minute!
Seattle has furnished 14,000 signatures,
as many as the rest of the state put to
gether, and then some. But Seattle can
furnish quite as many more names. The
petitions are still shy from 7.000 to 10,(XM)
names.
It is the city's greatest opportunity to
render the state its most valuable political
service. Seattle can free it from party
slavery. Seattle can make the state set the
example for the whole Union, the example
that merit, and not party bunk, should
guide us in the election of public officials.
Isn't that worth an hour of your
time today? And tomorrow? And
Thursday?
In an hour, you can get 20 signatures
to the Nonpartisan petition. And 500
volunteers can get 10.0(H) signatures. That
would be enough to make Nonpartisan
ship absolutely certain.
Get busy, men and women of Seattle.
Nonpartisanship headquarters is at 3107
Arcade building. The telephone number
is Klliott 4255.

Says He'll Aid U.S. in
Fight for World Peace
BERLIN (via Sayville Wireless), Dec.
26.—Germany today proposed a meeting
of delegates of belligerents in her answer
to President Wilson's peace note.
Her formal reply to the American peace suggestion was made
in a note handed to United States Ambassador Gerard at Berlin
and at the same time the American diplomatic representatives at
the capitals of the other central powers—Vienna, Sofia, Constan
tinople.
The note also hints that the "great work of the prevention of
future wars can be begun only after the end of the present strug
gle of nations," and declares "when this moment shall have
come," Germany will "be ready with pleasure to collaborate en
tirely with the United States at this exalted task."
The German note holds the "most appropriate road to reach
the 4esired result" is an "immediate meeting of delegates of bel
ligerent states at a neutral place."

The text of the note reads:
"The high-minded suggestions made by
the president of the United States of America
in order to create a basis for the establish
ment of lasting peace have been received and
considered by the imperial government in the
friendly spirit which was expressed in the
president's communication.
"The president points out that which he
has at heart and leaves open the choice of
the road.
"To the imperial government the imme
diate exchange of views seems the most ap
propriate road in order to reach the desired
results. It therefore begs, in the sense of its
declaration made on December 12, which of
fered its hand for peace negotiations, to pro
pose immediate meeting of delegates of the
belligerent states at a neutral place.
The text as transmitted over Sayville
wireless by the official press bureau in Ber
lin does not contain any peace terms.
Whether this is the entire text of the note
was not made clear in the wireless message.
"Also the imperial government is of the
opinion that the great work of prevention of
future wars can be begun only after the end
of the present struggle of nations.
"It will (namely, the German govern
ment will), when this moment shall have
