The third Christmas of the Euro
pean war passed without much fight
ing on the' British and French fronts,
where virtually only the artillery was
active, and men were feasted and en
tertained as far aa was compatible
with the aterner business of war.

fighting on the Rumanian front.
Ground was yielded by the Rumanians
at some points under the pressure of
the Germans, and north of the Buieu-
Rlmnik road a height wae lost by the
Russians.
In the northwest corner of Oobrudja
province, the sector to which the
Russo-Rumanian retreat has taken
them, the army of Field Marshal von
Mackensen has begun to attack the
bridgehead of Matchin, after Isaklshe,
on the eastern bank of the Danube,
was captured. In addition te an
nouncing the evacuation of Isakisha,
the Ruseians admit the occupation of
Tultcha.
British mounted troops, with the
co-operation of aircraft, carried a
strong position at Maghdaba, twenty
miles distant from El Arish, which
was captured on Thursday.- Incom
plete reports, says the statement
from London, show that 1130 pris
oners were captured and a large
quantity of arms and war material
taken. Heavy caaualties were suf
fered by the Turke. ?

LINDSAY, Ontario, Dec. 26. As
recruiting policy for Canada, Sir Sam
Hughes, former minister of militia In
the Canadian cabinet, In an address
here advocated the immediate calling
out of all single men between the
ages of 18 and 45 not now exempted
under the law for active service
training under the Canadian militia
act. He declared that the national
service commission was more or less
of a failure and that It would be a
year before the commission could
begin to operate with any effect
Prompt action is needed, Sir Sam
said, and the calling out of the aingle
men could be done under the provi
sions of the act. In order, however,
to remove all doubt regarding com
pulsory service for overseas, he said,
the act should be amended so that
the militia might be sent abroad tor
the defense of the empire. Under
this put a, glr Sans asserted, ha would

selves in near a monument marking
the boundary between New Mexico
and Chihuahua. The outposts were
forced to abandon their first' line

trenches were dug yesterday in an

companies were put to their wits'

greatest trouble was with the mine
where fhe water waa likely to entail
serious consequence. In such cases
bulkhead ing waa resorted to and the
water .dammed up where it could do
no damage during the suspension of
pumping operations. At one mine,
while the men were bulkheadlng, air
was sent down by hooking up to a
ford engine, which kept the fan In
motion-and enabled the crew to re
