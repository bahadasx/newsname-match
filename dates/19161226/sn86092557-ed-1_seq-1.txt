In the county jail here yesterday.
Thus did George Smith and Tom

Sheriff Conaway took the more
practical view and passed around silver
pieces to the prisoners, knowing
that this is sometimes of greater bene
fit to the down and out than all the
pretty things in the world. The prisoners
were permitted to enjoy themselves
to the utmost, giving them all
the freedom of the interior of the jait
and allowing them relaxation from
the regular discipline.
At the city jail there were hut one

PRINCESS LOUISE
HAS LOVE TROUBLES
Hungarian Riding Master is
Banished from Belgium
During War.
(Correspondence Associated Press)
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Dec. 26 ?TI10
love affair of Princess Louise of llel
glum, and hor former riding master.
Count Ton Matasslch. a Hungarian subject
and first lieutenant in the AustroHungarian
cavalry, hnd an interesting
aftermath recently when the count
was ordered to leave Budapest for ' political
reasons.'' He was ordered to
remove to his native town in Croatia,
cut eleventh-hour Interce/ ion by l)r
Visontai, the legal adviser of Princess
Louise, influenced the police to
permit Matasslch to remain in the capital
under survellancc.
Hack of the action lies the continued
endeavor of tho family of the princess
to separate hor from Matasslch,
who eloped with her when she was the
wife of Prince Philip of ttaxe-Coburg
in 1SA6. Some tltuo ago the family
suggested that the princess place herself
voluntarily under guardianship
lmt the princess has not yet consented
to this. Slio was not permitted to live
in either Vienna or Budapest, but finally
obtained permission to roslde in
Munich, where she now Is. It is considered
unlikely that Count Mai assick
will be given permission to go 10
Munich, so that for the duration of
the war, at least, the coiiplo will be
separated.

J
Persons who practice Safety First
will bring: their Hash lights ami lanterns
with them if they come down
town this evening, for unless arrangements
are made between press time
and dark. Main Street will be bathed
in nothing hut mellow moonlight. The
i old are lights came down this morning
I when the old poles were torn away.
. and since the globes for the new atfrs
have noi?arriv-wL-there is nothing to
produce light. There is a hare possibility
that the globes will arrive this
evening and by placing a large force
of men at work the Traction company
can get them in place before t\rk. It
may be also, that the old arcs wil he
strung from the new poles.
The old wooden lighting and tele
phone poles on Main street were comI
ins down today, a force of HO men hav
nig almost completed the work this
evening. Practically all the cables
of the Hell Telephone qpmpnity are
now underground and as soon as they
arc subtcranneously interred the Bell
poles will be removed. This, it is believed.
will be possible before the last
of the this week.
Workmen were slititig along cables
high above tlie street and clambering
from pole to pole, while in other places
their comrades wcro chopping. The
poles before being chopped off at the
base were steadied with largo ropes.
When the base was cut through these
ropes were used to let the poles gent
ly to the street and thus avert the
possibility of someone being injured
1 by a falling timber.
A considerable difference is noticein
the appearance of the street with
1 the poles removed. The street looks
; cleaner and lighter and sonsiderable
; more roomy.

AMSTERDAM. Dec. 2(i.?The Telegraaf
says It has reason to believe that
Germany's reply to Holland's npte regarding
deportation of Belgian workmen
is framed in such terms tliut it
was inadvisable to communi/ate it to
Dutch parliament and the government
has requested Berlin to alter the reply
in such a manner that (t may be presented
to the parliament.
The Dutch government last month
instructed its Berlin representative
to notify Germany that the H..1.-(.... .in.

Germany had responded in words
