According to a dispatch sent out
from Des Moines the district judges
of Iowa will ask the Thirty-seventh
general assembly to raise their sal
aries from $3,500 to $5,000.
There are fifty-nine district judges
in the state. On the present pay
basis they receive $206,500 annual
ly. The proposed increase would
call for an appropriation of $295,000
for salaries for judges. The judges
at the last session of the legislature
were granted an allowance for ex
penses, not to exceed $200 a year.
In asking for salary raises, the
judges declare that the high cost of
living has affected the bench as well
as all other lines. They assert thkt
a salary of $3,500 a year is not suf
ficient for the work performed by the
judges.
The active support of all the dis
trict judges and attorneys of the
state will be enlisted by the judges'
Politicians have discussed the need
of one more member of the supreme
court. If conditions are favorable, a
bill may be introduced in the next
legislature providing for enlarging
the court. Attorneys say that, by
adding one more judge, the work of
the court will be. speeded up.
