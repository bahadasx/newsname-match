FEAR FOR SAFETY
OF 20 ON BOARD
No Word From the Maryland,
Reported in Distress 1 50
Miles Off Hook
Orriclals ot tho Coast Guard service
fear for tho safety of tho crew of tho j
steamship Maryland, bound from
Philadelphia to London, which was '
reported sinking ut a point lAout HO ,
miles duo east of Handy Hook yester- j
day and has not been reported slueo.
Tho Maryland's pllxlit was made '
known through :i wireless mcssago
sent from tho vcsel whluli reached
all tho radio stations along tho coast
and also all vessels within touch. Tim
last word woa that her engine room
was flooded.
It so happened Hint Uito was not,
apparently, any vessel equipped with
wireless In tho Immediate vicinity of
the Mnrylund. Tho nearest vessel
was tho Const Guard cutter
Orcsham, about 100 iiiIIom awuy to .
tho northeast, und alio la now belloved
to bo hunting for tho Maryland or
to huvo reached hor.
The coaster City of Savannah,
bound from Savannah to Uoston and
duo lit UoBton thU afternoon, was ZOO
miles from tlio Maryland when tho
first .SOS call huh sounded and Is
believed to liavo headed toward tho
crippled vessel. '
Tho Coast Guard cutter Mohawk
received tho Maryland's signal for
help, but was 300 miles away, down
tho coast. Capt. Dunwoodlo, In
chargo ot tha coast guard hero, docs
not know whether tho Mohuwlc made
a try for tho Maryland or not.
The Maryland Is a steamer of the
whale-buck typo. Sho was built at
Wyandotte, Mich., In 1830 for Oreat
Lakes trado and engaged In fresh
water truffle until last summer when
sho waa bought by tho Crow-Lovlck
Oil Co. ot Philadelphia for the trans
Atlantic; trade. Tho Maryland waa
rebuilt at tho Cramp shipyards In
Philadelphia and left that port on
Dec. S3 with a miscellaneous cargo,
including oil, oil cakes, Iron pipe,
fibre and paper. The vessel Is of S,U9
gross tons, 314 fcot lone and 42 feet
beam. Sbo carries a crow ot about
twenty men.
Tho first distress call from tho
Maryland was picked up at 12,45 A. M.
It said tho engine room was being
rapidly flooded and asked for Im
modiato uld. Tho first part ot tho
inessago could bo easily heard by
stations hundreds of miles away, but
tho last part, giving the vessel's posi
tion as latitude 33 and longltudo G7,
becamo gradually weaker until It
could bo caught only by the most
powerful stations.
Tho cause of tho steamer's plight
was not given or Intimated. Tho
position who gave Is within a fow
miles of whero allied shipping was
raided by a German U-boat re

un tho opjioslto shoro burning. They
towed across tho lake, trlod In vuln
to extinguish tho Humes by dipping
up buckets of water, but In an hour
nothing remained of tho house savo

Amid thu charred ruins In the cel
lar of tho bungalow was found tho
upper part of a woman's body. Tho
lower purt had been burned awuy,
but a pool of wator hud saved tlio
head und torso from Incineration.
Tho burned cottage belonged to
Small, Tho partially burned remains
wero Uioso of his wlfo. Around her
neck was a plcco of clolhesllno tightly
drawn. Her skull was crushed In.
Around It was wrapptd a pillowcase,
Tho police said It was plain sho had

change of views seems the most appropriate road in
order to reach the desired result. It therefore begs,
in the sense of its declaration made on Dec. 12, which
offered its hand for peace negotiations, to propose im
mediate meeting of delegates of the belligerent states
at a neutral place.
"Abo the Imperial Government is of the opinion
that the great work of prevention of future wars can
be begun only after the end of the present struggle of
nations.
"It will (namely the'German Government will)
when this moment shall have come, be ready with
pleasure to collaborate entirely with the United States
' at this exalted task."
The answer finishes with the usual terms of interna
