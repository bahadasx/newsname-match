Will Not Accept Appointment
as Assistant to Alex
Langel.
"Nothing doing! I will not ac
cept the appointment of assistant to
Alex Langel as superintendent of
the South Bend branch of the In
diana free employment bureau." So
6ays Warren C. Ireland, recently
honored, or dlshonoied, by such ap
pointment made by Henry A. Rob
erts, state statistician-elect, after a
merry local political roxv.' in which
A. G. Graham, F. A. Miller, and
others, were arrayed against Ire
land, in behalf of Langel. Ireland
having the backing of County Chair
man Slick, Judge Vernon W. Van
Fleet, and others. Ireland appears
to have been double-crossed at sev
eral corners" the appointment being1
fixed up as a compromise.
"I not only will not accept the
appointment," says Ireland, "but
there has been no understanding on
my part as to division of salary.
That understanding seems to have
been concocted in the brain of the
Langel supporters and tendered me
as a sort of olive branch, expecting
It to induce my acceptance and sat
isfaction. I do not, and xvill not be
assistant to Mr. Langel on any
terms."
Mr. Ireland is at present truant
officer in South Rend. Langel is in
the employ of the city water depart
ment, his political support being
seriously wanted in the coming mu
nicipal campaign on the supposition
that he carries much of the second
ward vote in his vest pocket. The
story that hailed from Indianapolis
with regard to salary ran that the
$1,200 a year for the superintendent,
and $800 for a clerk, were to he
added together and the $2,000 evenly
divided between the txvo men. Such
a manipulation of salaries, it is
said, would be illegal to hegin with
regardless of its being resorted to to
heal political sores.
Ireland seems to regard himself
as entirely out of the afi'air, the re
sult of Graham-Miller, etc.. manip
ulations. Anyhow he will not ac
cept as Langel's assistant and de
clines any part in the understanding
with regard to division of salaries.

LONDON, Dec. 26. In view of
the unanimity of opinion among the
alUes rrrpid progress is being mad
towards framing a reply to the note
of Pres't Wilson, it xvas stated in
government circles today.
The allies' reply may be on its
xvay to Washington by the end of
the present week.
Russia has reaffirmed her determ
ination to right until Germany is
vanquished and the allies can dic
tate their oxvn peace terms. A
statement to this effect, which was
issued with the approval of the Rus
sian foreign office, has been issued
in Petrograd. Advices from the
Russian capital say that it is gen
erally regarded there as indicating
what the contents of the allies' reply
to Pres't Wilson's note will be.
The Chronicle in discussing the
American note expressed the belief
that it may have been inspired by
the visit of the German xvar sub
marine U-53 to American waters.
PETROGRAD, Dec. 25 (via Lon
don, Dec. 26) The first expression
of Russia's official attitude toward
Pres't Wilson's note xvas obtained by
the Associated Press Monday in the
form of the following statement
emanating from a high official
source and approved by the foreign
office:
"We pay tribute to the humani
tarian motives xvhich actuated Pres't
Wilson in turning to the warring" na
tions xvith the wish to conclude
peace. These motives are not for
eign to us.
'The initiative of Russia in the
domain of peace conferences which
would have placed a limitation upon
destructix-e xvars has always met
xvith opposition from Germany
v ere the defender of peace in
to the very la.st moment, when
We

Ger-
many declared war on tu.
"We also understand to what ex
tent war reacts on the neutral coun
tries' interests principally on account
of the manner in xvhich it is being
conducted by our enemies. Rut we
cannot help keeping in iexv th fact
that the American declaration xvas
made almost simultaneously xvith the
German one.
"In its true sense the German of
fer is now known to all. Germany
considers herself a victor and thinks
to dictate to us terms of peace. Un
der such conditions the beginning
of peace negotiations with Germany
would signify our acknowledgment
of defeat. We deeply believe in the
triumph of right and justice for
xvhich xv e are lighting and xvhen
this will prevail then xvill rome the
time for sincere peace negotiations.'"
