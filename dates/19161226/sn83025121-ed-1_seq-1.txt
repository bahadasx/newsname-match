WASIIINC.TON, December
25 Switzerland's govern
ment has joined hands with the
Washington administration and
Friday addressed a note to the
belligerent powers announcing
that it will (Utpport Mr. Wilson's
effort' to secure'-a discussion of
peace terms by the warring na
tions. ajl the nations at war, as; well as
to the leading, nU.Ul, the Swiss
government declares that "we
would consider ourselves as most
fortunate and happy; if Switzer
land can, in the most modest fash
ion, act so as to bring peace near
er. BACKING PRESIDENT
"The step taken by President
Wilson lias found a ready and
mighty echo in the hearts of the
people of this country, where day
after day we arc forced to listen
to the moans of suffering Europe.
"Our whole land is 'illed to
overflowing with a longing for
peace, and we are ready to assist
by any and every means in our
power to put a stop to the endless
suffering which is brought before
our eyes daily by our contact with
the interned, the wounded and the
expelled peoples of our neighbor
ing countries."
Word of the action of the Swiss
government reached the chancel
lories of the warring nations Satur
day afternoon, the note having
been sent Friday, but was not
made public immediately. Yester
day however it was generally
known throughout France and
Great Britain, and the reception
given the note by tTie press of those
countries was hardly less antagon
istic! than that which greeted the
message of Mr. Wilson.
FRENCH DETERMINED
The French public and the
French papers, lead by the most
influential of them, characterized
the Swiss note in much the same
sort of language that they used for
the Wilson communications. Com
ing as it has upon the heels of the
recent vote of the French senate,
declaring without a single excep
tion that France is prepared to
fight on so long as one enemy oc
cupies one foot of French soil, they
declare that it is hardly necessary
In reiterate that France will fight
mi lo the end.
Many of the leading journals say
that the message should be "re
ceived with courteous attention,"
but that is all. They one and all
repeat the determination to con
tinue the war until victory has
nvned the efforts of the Allies.

Western Republicans, among others, be
cause in the recent election they see
the West slipping from their graxji and
the Smoot tye of officials being re
tired as fust as voters can get at them.
It ia 0Kuly talked, indeed, that there
is every prospect the voters of Utah
will "get" Senator Smoot at the very
next pulling for hi successor. For
tunately for him, perhaps, that is four
years Owuy. But eastern Republicans
years away. Hut Kustern Republicans
abta, want to omit no reasonable thing
toward winning the West back. And
they want to quelrb Smoot and others
with him who einphnsizo the ultra
standpatters. This process may not be very easy
for there is iniuh senate discuHsion on
the Republican side. The need of good
leadership is recognized but for the
present there is too much divided coun
cil on the Republican side to attain
it. Senator l.aFollette, of Wisconsin,
is not a leader of men iu the senute but
he exercises a tremendous influence
there more influence than ever since
the enormous vote Wisconsin gave him
at the last election. There are Senator
Cummins of Iowa, and Senator Horah
of Idaho, among others. A far as
leadership on the Republican sido of
the senate is concerned, it is growing
more and more Western. The 'power
of Kastem Republicans, particularly of
New buglnnd Republicans, is waning
iu that body. Nearly all of them are
so-called stuiidputtcrs. The fact that
nearly all of New Kngland ultnost went

strengthened this New Lngland group
iu the slightest.
