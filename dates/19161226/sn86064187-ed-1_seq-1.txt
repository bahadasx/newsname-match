TEXT OF GERMANY'S REPLY
BERLIN, Dec. 26. The answer of Germany and her allies,
Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, to the peace note of Presi
dent Wilson reads as follows:
"The high minded suggestions made by the president of the
United States of America, in order to create a basis for the estab
lishment of a lasting peace, have been received and considered by
the imperial government in the friendly spirit which was expressed
in the president's communication.
"The president points out that which he has at heart and leaves
open the choice of road.
"To the imperial government an immediate exchange of views
seems to be the most appropriate road in order to reach the desired
result.
"It begs, therefore, in the sens? of the declaration made on De
cember 21 which offered a hand for peace negotiations, to propose
an immediate meeting of the belligerent states, at a neutral place.
"The imperial government is also of the opinion that the great
work of preventing further wars can be begun only after the end of
the present struggle of the nations.
"It will, when this moment shall have come, be ready with
pleasure to collaborate entirely with the United States in this ex
alted task."
The answer of the central povvers concludes with the usual dip
lomatic terms of politeness.

must on ait average bring three chil
dten to maturity if the pnpulation ii to
he kept up and not decreased, it was
declared here today at a meeting of
the American (ienelic association, hy
Dr Robert M Spragtte of the Mia
ihtisetts Agricultural college. Of the
graduates of our wcvwn'a colleges, he
said, only one-half ever marry and
"the average number of children per
graduate is less than one" The meet
ing is being held by the association as
one of the affiliated organirations tak
ing part in the sixty ninth convention
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science
Discussing the constructive principle
of birth control, Dr. SpraRiie went on
to say that "for one great section of
the population we need hirth control
and for the other birth release" He
declared birth control was practiced
extensively among the middle daises of
our native population in the industrial
and "inteniely civiliied regious of this
country. " On the other hand, he said
excessive birth rate "beyond the abil
iiy of parents to support and beyond
the resonrrei of the nation to provide,
i pporl tin it ies for is one of the greatest
evils that can befall a people "

Central Powers Indorse
President Wilsons Note
and Suggest Conference
Meeting in Neutral City Urged to Ex
change Peace Terms; Co-operation in
Formation of League to Prevent Future
Wars Promised After Hostilities End.
i
BERLIN, Dec. 2fi. Germany and her allien Austria
Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey today replied to the note of
President Wilson in which he asked that the belligerent na
tions stale the aims for which they were fighting.
The proposal is made by the central powers that a con
ference of the delegates of all the belligerents be held imme
diately in a neutral city.
The task of preventing future wars, the official statement
says, can be started only after the end of the present struggle.
The reply was transmitted to James W. Gerard, American
ambassador at Berlin.
German Method
Surprises American Officials
WASHINGTON, Dec. .-Officials
here are surprised that Germany's an
swer to President Wilson's peace note
was given out in Berlin before it
reached this country in official form
They pointed out that in sending his
note President Wilson allowed two
days between the time of its dispatch
and making Ht public that it might first
reach the (ierman government.
In the absence of an official reuly
formal comment was withheld at the
White House and the state department
The direct proposal for a conference
oLdeUgatcs at neutral jilact was
regarded as a further step fiTTier
many's proposal, although officials con
sidered it as having been definitely
forecast in the first proffer. Such a
formal offer has repeatedly been men
tioned in authorized statements at thr
German embassy here. whAe the opin
ion freely has been expressed that if
delegates once could be gathered
around a table for the purpose of dis
cussing peace the result surety would
be an arrangement of terms.
The Berlin dispatch containing the
German reply was read by President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing with
United States Expects Peace
Projects From Other Neutrals
WASHINGTON. Dec. 26-Jndiea-tions
in official circles here this morn
ing were that Switzerland in support
ing the United States' peace proposal
may be followed by similar action on
the part of other European neutrals.
Holland, Spain, the Scandinavian coun
tries and the pope, it was said, are ex
pected to take some action in the near
future.
Dr. Paul Ritter, the Swiss minister,
will see President Wilson within a few
days to discuss the peace situation. He
called at the White House today to
gather information on how the Swiss
peace note had been received in this
country in order to send a report to
his government
Dr. Ritter was conierned over news
taper reports that the action of th
Swiss government was construed as
support for the caute of the central
powers. He told Secretary Tumulty
the action of his government was sole
ly in the interest of peace

UNKNOWN MAN KILLED

of Replying
the greatest interest Some official
who compaied the reply with President
Wilson pole professed to see some
conflict between it and the German
statement that the work of securing
Ihe future peace of thr world should
be delayed until the etui of the present
struggle while others were of the opin
ion that It was not entirely out of har
mony.
President Wilson's purpose has r
peatedly been expressed as making for
the preventing of future wars as a parf
of the settlement of the present con.
flict, but admittedly thtt is a subject
bttarjijoii&h to allow 'some variation
when it comes to final consMerafion.
Ibis afternoon the official text of the
note had not been received at the stat
department Count von Bernstorff. the
German ambassador, had gone to Nessf t
York and so far as could be learned,
the German embassy's onlv informa
tion was in the Associated Press dis
patch. The unofficial text of dertnany's re
ply did not get before the cabinet be
cause the Tuesday meeting was sud
denly abandoned a few minutes before
the secretaries were due at the Whitt
House.
tral European nations continued to tr
rive at the White House today in large
numbers. All commended the president
for his recent note and indicated that
strong pressure was being brought on
the government! of European neutrals
to take action.
While the United States will con
tinue to act alone, supporting action hs
other neutral nations, it is said, will
be welcomed hy President Wilson.
Spanish Minister Rian.i confrrredl

officials rrfusrd o disci,.,, me meet
