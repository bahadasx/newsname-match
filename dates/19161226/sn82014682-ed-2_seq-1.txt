ME TO SECURE

FOR IIAUAII WADE
Farm Cornn and W. H. Hindle
Leave for Washington to
Interview Congressmen
- Hope to Get Support of Or
ganized Labor r
To endeavor to Interest Washington
officials and congressmen in a plan
t.1 bring into the Territory of Hawaii
25,0:0 Chinese as laborers. Farm
. Cornn, well-known local Chinese busi
nessman, and W. H. Hindle of the
- Mercantile Reference Agency, left this
morning for Washington on the Great
Northern. This plan, which has been
vf under consideration for several years.
V is apparently backed by all the Chi
cese interests in the islands, Includ
ing the Chinese Chamber of Com
merce. From information received
from Washington It is understood that
neveral congressmen and government
officials are in favor of the. plan and
that Farm Cornu's proposition will be
given every consideration. ""
'. While -on the mainland be will also
. see Samuel Gompers, head of the
American Federation of Labor, and try
to obtain union labor's support, the
idea being that if the Chinese are per
mitted to come into the territory they
w ill remain here as a constant labor
supply, while a number of nationali
ties brought here soon emigrate to the
states and thus disrupt the labor or
ganizations there. .'
, As a local argument it is pointed out
that the rice Industry here Is dying
out and if a sufficient number of Chi
nese are-imported that important in
dustry will be revived.
C. K. Ai, manager of the City Mill
."' Company, is actlveir". interested in the
movement, believing It will be of un-
, told benefit, to the Islands. Al said
this morning that he nas had a num
ber of communications from United
' States congressmen, including John L.
Burnett, chairman of the house im
, migration committee, and James L,
felayden of Texas, in which the tone
indicates. that they favor the idea.
There are also a number of Honolulu
businessmen giving their support, he
caid. . - ... . . ' , ; 1
When a party of "congressmen visit
ed Hawaii in the spring of 1915, local
Chinese approached Burnett and other
members of the house immigration
1 committee, as well as congressmen
I not on the committee, to discuss the
' question of abrogating the Chinese
Exclusion Act or modifying it in some
respect so that a large number of Chi-
to obtaine union labor's support, the
