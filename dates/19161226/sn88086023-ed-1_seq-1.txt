In making hi annual report as
trustee of the Sturgi fund, Judge.
Jamoo A. Fee indulge In me point
ed pleamntriea that makes the report
anvthing but dry and prosaic.
For Instance In explaining why th
fund has not earned more during tho
past year, he state, he felt onlige.i
to call In certnln lonns and to hold
the money In the bank In case he
should need It In a fight to prevent
the endowment fund from being di
verted rrnm the purpose" Intended b
the donor. The responsibility for the
failure of the fund to earn more dur
ing the year, he snvs. he divides w th
the ronnjy emtrr. Commercial asso
ciation, women-' rliila. I'marllla cottf
ty tihrnrlan. the Oregon legislature
and diverse and sundry other Indi
viduals and corporations who all
wanted n hand In the management of
the fund
lie concludes with the statement
that. Inasmuch a.s tho Commercial
club now claims ownersh'-p of th
fund, he will not, as trustee, buy nn?
more hooks with the enrnlnes of the
fund until the association hns estno
llshed Its title or tinle's he feels able
to prm'ect the fund.
"It hns been suggested, he nd'M
facetiously, "that If the Commercial
association Is denied the privilege ot
using the money as a 'smok'ng fund'
the cemetery comml'tee will probably
lav claim tn lt."
The report shows that the Sturg's
fund now nmounts to J17.2H4.62. Its
value on April 11, 1!4, at the det i
of Col. lloyd. the other trimtee. was
$7,357.66. The Incron'e up until Dec.
