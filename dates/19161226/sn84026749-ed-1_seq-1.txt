Congressman "Wood, Author of

New Clues.
If Thomas W. Lawson can proro

portant .Governmental move In
Washington he may be given an op

Chnlrman Henry, of the House
lltilra Committer, before which la

Inquiry Into the 'leak" that caused
Ihr bear raid en the market aa the
I'rrsldent'a peace note went forward,
today extended Mr. Lawson an In
formal Invitation to tell the Rules
Committee what ho know.
"If Mr. Lawson .possesses In for
mntlon about a, 'teak' he ought to
cnniF before thla committee and
furnish ua with the facta," aald Mr.
Henry. "We will be glad to have
such facta and possibly Mr. Lawson'a
testimony would reault In, the report
of the Wood, resolution and a Con
gressional Investigation. Let Mr.
l.aweon come down and we will
Klyn him a hearing-, na he claims to
be well posted."
Held Vp By Holidays.
Chairman Henry aald no conaldera
tlon would be Riven the Wood reso
lutlon until after .the Chrlitmaa
holldaya. According to Mr. Henry,
the nulea Committee now haa noth
ing tangible before It to reveal the
nerfH of an Inquiry Into the alleged
leak" on tli? 'peace note, but It la
understood the committee Is not
averse to reporting the Wood reso
lution If a certain amount of Infor
mation Is furnished.
Mr. Henry read with considerable
Interest the recent statement of J."r.
I.awaon claiming that "leaks" from
Washington are of frequent occur
rence, and "the public "pays" therefor
la the stock markets.
If Mr. Lawson cares to make Rood
on that statement It probably will
have considerable Influence upon the
action of the Rules Committee, al
though It la not expected that a form
al request or subpoena will be Issued
for Mr. Lawson.

Congressman Wood of Indiana, au

whether any one high In Administra

directly by advance Information re

the holiday seeking cleus which he
may present to the Rules Commit

Mr. Wood claims to have found a
new line of Investigation which may
bring Important developmenta before
Congress reconvenes.
The Indiana members la also ex.

ha had advance Information about the
peace note, and that leaks of this
sort are of common occurrence.

"Thla man brags that he was aware

"That of Itself should be sufficient to
justify a report of my resolution. An
Investigation ahould be begun."
It la possible that the statement of

argue that It will be a waste of time
to vote on the prohibition amendment

Secretary Lane partially confirmed
the Impression that today waa the

for the signing of the protocol, but
as to all else he waa noncommittal.
"All that I can say," declared Mr.
Lane, "Is that we expect a reply to

"Are your expectations founded on
knowledge that a reply is coming, or
are they the results of a previous un

"That," he replied, "waa the under

Ellseo Arredondo also denied the re

Secretary Lansing, and avoided all

hearing nothing from his government.
- "The matter Is entirely oJt of the

SCARES AWAY INTRUDER
OSSlPnU, N. II., Dec, 20 Frederick
U. Small of Mountain View, Boston
broker, goes on trial this afternoon,
charged with the murder of nla wife,
Arltne, on September SO, and the
burning of her body afterward by
means of a clockwork bomb'.
The question of H mail's guilt may
hinge upon evidence showing whether
his wife ate two or three meals on
the day of the yriurder. If she ate
three. Small stands a good chance of
acquittal. If only two. the accused
man win have a hard right to prove
his Innocence, despite an apparent
alibi.
Ileata On Insurance I'alley.
On a Joint life Insurance policy, by
which Hmsll came Into $20,000 through
his wife's death, the State will rest
most of Its weight, flmall, when cap
tured In a Boston hotel after the
crlme.attempted to destroy the papers
which furnish damaging circum
stantial evidence against him.
On the 2Dlh of Beptember, the email
cottage, orr the ahore of Lake Os
slppee, waa destroyed by fire. VII
lagers who gathered to witness the
spectacle were horrified when, as
thi embera cooled, the body of Mrs.
Small, one of the most beautiful wo
men In the community, was found In
the ruins.
Fire Bet By Time Bomb,
Investigation showed that she had
ben strangled and shot through the
head, and that the fire had been set
by a time bomb.
Small left his home shortly after
lunch the day of the crime. If the
murdered woman'a stomach, which
waa examined at Dartmouth College,
showed that she ate supper that day.
Small will have, hla attorneys be
lieve, a perfect alibi, for It will ahow
that she was murdered after he left.
If, however, she had hut two meals,
another link will be added to tho
chain of circumstantial evidence
which surrounds her husband, for no
one else went near the small cottage
oerore nightfall.

Administration Official Pessimistic
as to Peace Conference.
Hasty examination of Germany's
reply to President Wilson's peace sug

dispatches from Berlin, led one of the
foremost administration officiate to

not be satisfied to meet the Teuton
proposals.
This omciai declared mat ne is
strongly of the opinion that "the pro

ranging a peace conference at this

He. expressed the view that the al
lies would not consent to a peace meet
ing based on any such answer aa w,as
given In the brief reply by Germany.
Moreover, he held that Germany had
directly dodged the request of the
United States for something specific In
the way of peace terms.
The German answer squared with
Ambassador Bernstorff'a recent atate
ment that Germany Is willing to state
her terms at A round-table session.
Preliminary examination Indicated
to Administration officials that the
entente allies will be unwilling to
Join such a session unless they can

the possibility of this being the first

British Anger Cools.
LONDON. Dec ;i-Brltlsh hostility
toward President Wilson appeared to
have been considerably mollified to
day. The change was attributable to the
latest interpretations or the motives

It aa having been sent with the main
purpose of forcing Germany to atate
her peace terms, and to carry the Im
plication that unless these terms are

the war on the side of the allies.
There was, however, considerable
continued criticism of what was
termed the President's "obscurity and
Infelicity" of language and his appar

objects of the war.
