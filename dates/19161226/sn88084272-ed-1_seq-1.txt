Field Headquarters. American Puni

great Christmas celebration, prepared
for the field headquarters camp here,
was spoiled late Monday when the
worst storm yet experienced In this
region descended and swept the mili
tary encampment from end to end- "
Swirling down the chimneys of the
adobe sharks, the wind filled the
dwellings with smoke which drove of
ficers and men into the open until the
hearth and stove fires could be extin
guished. Tents were flattened, adobe houses
unroofed and kitchen fires blown
away.
Because of the dust, eery man njt
on guard duty was allowed to seek
shelter from the stifling dust. Order
lies, sent out with messages, became
lost in camp and took an hour to walk
a thousand yards. Hundreds of men
were hatless tlay because the wind
swent their headgear away.
Gen. Pershing directed the efforts of
a score of orderlies to preserve his
living quarters from being blown
away.
Two artillerymen were injured by
falling adobe walls. One had a broken
leg and the other a fractured hip.

British Leaders Insist Peace
Now "Would Be Bondage
For Britain, France.
Paris. France. Dec 16. In addresses
before the national congress of the
French Socialist part-. Arthur Hender
son, the British cabinet minister, and
G. H. Roberts, member of the British
parliament, both affirmed, amid enthu
siastic cheers, that the war must be
fought out until all guarantees have
been obtained for a lasting peace.
"In my opinion." said Mr. Henderson,
if France and oursflves were to enter
i Into negotiations under evintine- con
ditions we should be nations in bond
age. Nothing les than that is the
price our enemies would exact for
peace today."
M. Vandelverde, uetlared that the
struggle must be carried on until Bel
gium and Serbia are delivered and
"Caesarism is laid low "
Dnngcrou Period at Hand.
In his speech Mr. Henderson said
In mv opinioii we have now reacheil
the most dangerous and difficult period
of the war. During the next feu
months the democracies of England and
France are going to be tested as never
before. Do not misunderstand me, I do
not mean that the stress and strain of
fighting in the tield will be more se
vere, although I do not ignore such a
possibility. But the danger is of en
tirely a different character.
Our stupendous losses, our unprece
dented sacrifices, our horror of war,
our love of peace, may lead us to mort
gage the future. With such awful ex-
per fences we are apt to forget the great
moral, eternal principles and ideals of
which we enter-d the struggle. We aro
not only fighting a negative action
against a material force which is high
!v organized but we are engaged in a '
great conflict noon the result of which
uepena our great ideals.
