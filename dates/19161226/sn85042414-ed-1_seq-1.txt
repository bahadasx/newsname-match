Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 26.—"It is

Sir Arthur Henderson and
G. H. Roberts Address
French Socialists.
MOST DANGEROUS
PERIOD OF WAR
France and England to be
Put to Their Severest
Tests in Spring.
Paris, Dec. 26.—In addresses at the
National Congress of the French So
cialist party, Sir Arthur Henderson,
the British cabinet minister, and G. H.
Roberts, member of the British par
liament, both affirmed, amidst enthus
iastic cheers, that the war must be
fought out until full guarantees had
been obtained for a lasting peacc.
"In my opinion," Mr. Henderson
said, "if France and ourselves were
to enter into negotiations under ex
isting conditions we should be nations
In bondage. Nothing less than that
is the price our enemies would exact
for peace today."
Emile Vandervolde, the Belgian So
cialist leader, said:
"Our comrades who liavo remain
ed in Invaded Belgium endured Ger
man dominion with admirable firm
ness. Nothing but encouragement
reaches us from then). So that it
would seem that the persons most
hostile to war are those farthest from
it."
In his speech, Mr..Henderson said:
"In my., opinion, we .have now
reached the piost dangerous and dif
ficult perlpd, .of the- war. During- tha
next, few jupp.ths the democracies of
Wngland and France are going to be
tested a?. nev?v. jDefore. Do not mil-,
understand n^e.. I.do'hot mean that
tho stres'p. and strain of fighting In
the field, jyijl bp. more severe, al
though I. do not ignore such a po's
filfoility. .But the danger is of en
tirely a different character.
"Our stupendous losses, our unpre
cedented sacrifices, our horror of war,
our love of peace, may lead lis to
mortgage the future. "With such aw
ful experiences, wo are apt to forget
the great moral., eternal principles
and ideals, fpr. which we entered the
struggle. We are not only fighting a
negative action against material forces
which are highly organized, but wa
are engaged in a great spiritual con
flict upon the results of which de
pend all our great ideals. If we en
ter into negotiations now we do a,»
when Germany is not repentant for
her wrong doings and is glorifying in
the success of her military efforts.
In fact, In the victory of German im
perialism.
"The choice today is between an
untimely peace, with years of fear
and a few months of suffering, an!
a lasting peace.
"We hate war. It is brutal, the
negation of even-thing for which we
stand. Therefore, we must prevent
its recurrence so far as in our power.
We desire to see the democracies of
the world free to progress to their
highest ideals. To accomplish this
we must stand together for the de
structioh of militarism, the vindica
tion of national nyht and liberty, the
punishment of national wront Be
the nations large or sjnall, they must'

Sandy Hook.
Since the first call for help, which
was picked up by wireless stations in
this city and at the naval station at
Newport, R. i„ no further word, was
received from the Maryland .and It
was believed that the) vessel's, wireless

and the consequent lack of power.
Although two steamships named
Maryland are listed in the maritime
register, one a British vessel, .of. 2,962
tons and the other an American of
1,892 tons, it is believed that the latter
is the vessel in distress off the coast.

of the building occupied by Jones and
Vassau Hardware .company and the

Within a few .minutes the entire
structure was enveloped in flames, and
fanned by a 40 mile gale, swept to the
J. H. McDonald machine shop and the
Ellis Ross pool hall- All three were
wooden structures and little progress
could be made by the volunteer fire
men.
Jfext to the Ross pool hall the H. H.
Teeson dry goods establishment, a

Wilson in which he asked that the belligerent na

The proposal is made by the central powers that a

Berlin, by wireless to Sayville, Dec. 26.—The text of
Germany's answer to President Wilson's note was trans
mitted today by James W. Gerard, the Amerisan ambassa
dor.
The answer which also contains the reply of Austria
Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded suggestions made by the president
of the United States of America in order to create a basis
for the establishment of a lasting peace have been received
and considered by the imperial government in the friendly
spirit which was expressed in the president's communica
tion.
"The president points out that which he has at heart
and leaves open the choice of road.
"To the imperial government an immediate exchange
of views seems to be the most appropriate road in order to
reach the desired result.

END OF CONFUCT
STOCK RAID ON

p.i. urcun
N. D. Senator Says Persons
Having Advance Infor
mation Sold Short.
Washington, Dee. 26.—That Presi
dent Wilson's friends had knowledge
of and made use of the fact that he
was to send his latest peace note to
the warring countries was the charge
made today by Senator P. J. McCum
ber of North Dakota, a member of
the senate committee on foreign re
lations.
"My information is," said Senator
McCumber, "that the friends of Presi
dent Wilson had advance information
concerning the sending of the peace
note and used that information to
make a raid on the stock market, sell
ing stocks short and cleaning up a
great deal of money when the publi
cation of the peace note was made.
I do not charge that the president
gave them this information, but I do
charge that they had it and made
use of it.
"The president's note was ill timed
and ill advised, and should not have
been sent. Secretary Robert Lansing's
statements merely served to make the
matter worse. There were several
things in the note which I do not like.
In the first place he Intimates in his
note that neither side knows what it
is fighting for, and I do not believe
that such an intimation will meet
with a cordial reception abroad. I
think that the allies have repeatedly
stated what they are fighting for and
Germany has contended right along
that it is fighting to defend itself."
