GERMANY ASKS "ROUND-TABLE"
Will State
Tolerate am
Execution?
On Jan. 19, at some point in this state, a
noose will be placed about the neck of a man
—Edward Mayberry, half-breed Indian,
convicted at Spokane, of murdering his
sweetheart, on federal territory.
A trap will be sprung. There will be a
tautening of the rope—and a life will be
snuffed out—the life of a human being!
IT WILL BE DONE IN THIS STATE,
WHICH HAS DECIDED THAT CAPI
TAL PUNISHMENT IS ARCHAIC, AND
ABOLISH ED IT!
How about it? Shall Mayberry hang?
This isn't a question of the man's guilt or
innocence. A jury of seemingly competent
men decided lie was guilty. Let it go at
that!
But it IS a question of whether the people
of this state, once having decided that capi
tal punishment belonged to the dark ages
and having wiped it from the slate, will
countenance it again.
A widespread appeal is being sounded to
President Wilton for clemency. One of
those who has become interested in the case
is Qov. Lister.
Each of you can do your share by writing
a personal letter direct to the president, just
as the governor did.
If this is done throughout the state, as it
bids fair to be done, a mighty voice of pro
test will ring back to Washington —a pro
test which it will be difficult to ignore! Will
you write?

Christmas Travelers
End Day in Talk Fest

The Seattle-Tacoma boat was
crowded Christmas night.
Holiday travel is different from
the travel of other days, say those
who handle it.
"No strangers," commented the
gray-haired little "Travelers' Aid"
woman at the municipal dock.
"Everybody knows where he's
going."
Like a great, lumbering firefly,
the boat churned and pounded
through the darkness.
The night was cold and quiet
and starry outside; but the long
cabin was warm with the heat of
many bodies, and noisy with the
rattle of the player-piano.
The hard brilliance of the elec

but with a different tiredness
from that of every-day.
Families had been spending
Christmas Day together, the home

SENDS REPLY
TG WILSON'S
PEACE NOTE!
(I'nited Ptass Leased Wire.)
BERLIN, via Wireless, Dec. 26.—Germany today
proposed a meeting of delegates of belligerents in her
answer to President Wilson's peace note.
Her formal reply to the American peace suggestion
was made in a note handed to U. S. Ambassador Ger
ard at Berlin and at the same time the American dip
lomatic representatives at the capitals of the other
central powers—Vienna, Sofia, Constantinople.
The note also hints that the "great work of the
prevention of future wars can be begun only after the
end of the present struggle of nations," and declares
"when this moment comes," Germany will be "ready
with pleasure to collaborate entirely with the U. S. at
this exalted task."
The German note holds the "Most appropriate
road to reach the desired result," is an immediate
meeting of delegates of belligerent states at a neutra
peace conference.
The text reads:
"The liigh-mimletl sugges
tions made by the president
of llul 1 . S. of America, in
order to create a basts for the

The text as transmitted over Sayvllle wireless by the official

Washington Optimistic
WASHINGTON, I). C, Dec 2t'>.
--Hasty examination of Ger
many's reply to President Wil-
son's peace suggestions, as con
tained in dispatches from Merlin,
led one of the foremost adminis
tration officials today to state his
belief that the entente allies will
not be satisfied to meet the Teu
tonic proposals.
He expressed the view that the
allies would not consent to a
peace meeting leased on any such
answer as was- given in Ihe brief
reply by Germany.
He held that Germany had di
rectly dodged the request of the
11. S. for something specific in
the way of peace terms.

Tlie German answer squared
with Atnliassador Mernstorff's re
cent slatement that Germany is
willing to state her terms at a
round table session.

that the entente allies will be tin
willing to join such a session un

Terms Given Secretly?
(VnilPd Prras l.rasrd Wire.)
ROME, Dec. 26. —Germany has
handed to the neutral nations

The report had it that this
packet was sent with instructions
that it was only to be read and

Otherwise it was to be returned

In some official circles It was

At the White House there waa
no disposition on the part of th*

Some officials in this connec
