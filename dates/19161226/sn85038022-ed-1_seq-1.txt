SOME SLIPPERY
Robert W. Kosa, aged about 27,
made the mistake of his life Sunday
night when he turned highwayman and
attempted to ply his "chosen profes
sion" in this city, but we'll have to
hand it to Robbie for his bold at
tempt.
Sunday night Mrs. James Ireland
and daughter. Miss Ada, after making
some purchases at the F. H. Traxel
Confectionery Store, started for their
home on West Second street. They
had proceeded but a ahort distance
when they thought they were being
followed by a young white man, who
passed them and dodged Into January
alley at the Second street entrance.
With their fears allayed, the ladles
proceeded on and Just aa they at
tempted to cross the alley the man
niade a lunge at them, striking Miss
Ada a stunning blow in the breaat.
Both ladles began screaming, and Of
ficer William Throckmorton, who was1
on his way down Second street on his
regular round, heard them and madei
a quick run to their secue. He saw
the figure of a man disappearing
through the alley towards Front street
and the officer immediately took up
the pursuit. The fugitive turned west:
on Front street with the officer close u 1
upi.n him. When about ten feet from
Wall street Throckmorton pulled his 42
centimeter and called to the man to'
Stop, which he did. The officer then
took htm back and the ladles Identl-:
fl"d him and he was taken before
Chief Mackoy, where he plead Ignor
ance of his recent bold act. The Chief
very promptly ordered him locked up

The condition of the sidewalks in
this city in the past few days have
been Buch that only those who are
experienced in the art of balancing
themselves could keep their footing.
Many preferred to take the middle of
the street Instead of risking them
selves on the pavements. Those
thoughtful persons that have scattered
ashes or aawduat on their pavements
certainly are considerate of others and
