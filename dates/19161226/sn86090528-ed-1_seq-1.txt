ANOTHER
MEXICAN
TRAGEDY
Peaceful Christmas Day in Chickasha
Marred by Killing in Store on Two
Street Yesterday
TOMAS ALDABA SHOT
DEAD BY FRANK GAL1ND0
Galindo Will Claim Self Defense Saying
Aldaba Had Threatened to Kill
Him on Sight
Claiming self defense as the motive,
Francisco Galindo, a farmer living
near Norge, is behind the bars charged
with, the killing on Ch.istmas on Two
street of another Mexican farmer, Tom
as Aldaba, who lives near his place.
Aldaba's remains will be sent to Ana
darko for burial.
Frank Galindo, who is forty-five
years old and has a wife and several
children, asserts that for some weeks
Aldaba had been threatening him and
that several nights ago Aldaba and an
other man, armed with knives, had
watched for him outside of a restau
rant in Chickasha with the avowed
pi rpose of killing him when he should
appear. That he had been warned
that Aldaba meant to kill him and that
he had gone to the sheriff of Grady
eoitnty before the killing and expressed
the fear that he would have to protect
himself against his neighbor, who when
drunk had been quarrelsome and had
even harshly attacked and quarreled
with Francisco's children, is a matter
of record.
Story of Eye Witness
'J;..,i: n. do Negri tc, in "i. jila .
at 42 South Second street the tragedy
per.,r d, was an eye witness to nearly
all that occurred in connection with
tho killing, lie said today:
"Tomas Aldaba, the dead man, was
half Indian and half Mexican and
farmed near Anadarko, where he
leaves a widow and several small chil
dren. His father had ji;st been operat
ed on at the hospital in Chickasha.
Both he and FranciHco Galindo, who
did tho shooting, were my friends.
Francisco, or Frank ha.d been sleeping
in my bed for a couple of hours just
before the trouble arose. Both visited
nie often when in town and I extended
credit to bolli of them.
"There was no one but my brother
and myself in the store at five o'clock
yesterday evening when Tomas same
in and ordered a plate of chile and a
can of sardines, saying he had not yet
breakfasted. He had just finished
when Frank came in. Tomas told me
that he did not bring any money -"'th
him but that he would pay his account
later, which was perfactly satisfactory
to me. At this moment Frank came
in with two white men and ordered
some chile but did not eat it. He hand
ed it to one of the white men who in
turn passed it to his companion and
Frank arose, addressing an insulting
remark to Tomas Aldaba to which the
latter did not reply. Frank kept up
the quarrel and I stepped in and told
them that my place was not the proper
one in which to settle difficulties and
asked them to leave. Another Mexican
boy, Table Romero, asked the men
why they were quarreling. "Do yon
want something out of me too?" asked
Frank. Romero replied that they were
all Mexicans and ought not to quarrel
and that he wanted them all to be
friends. Another Mexican entered and
took Romero out leaving Frank and
Tomas there. Then Frank told Tomas
that he was no man. Tomas replied
"All right. You call me eabresto' and
you call me no man. Maybe 1 am not."
"Then you may go to " shouted
Frank, at the same time drawing his
gun and firing at Tomas, hitting him
near the heart. Tomas then grabbed
a bench and strarted for Frank. While
the two me grappled the pistol was
discharged striking a white boy in the
arm. About this lime Tomas' strength
gave way and he collapsed. While
falling to the floor a third shot was
fired.
"While the two men were grappling
I left the room and Frank ordered my
brother to h-ave also. He did so ami
called the officers Who arrived just
after Tomas had fallen. They put him
on my bed but l:e died after reaching
the hospital."
"1 was so confused when he drew
his knife on tin yesterday at Negrete's
place I hat I do not remember much of
what happened," said Galindo today.
"t only know that ho fame "on toward
me wlih a knife and that to protect
myself 1 shot him. I had been warned
for a week to watch out for him."
About a year ago a brother-in-law of
the dead man shot und killed a nephew
of the prisoner but Francisco said this
did not. enter into (lie ease as he had
had no ill feeling toward Aldaba on
that score.
, After the shooting Tucker und Gun
nells arrested Galindo and took. him
to the city jail where he was later turn
ml over to the county authorities. The
wounded man was taken to tho hospi
tal but expired before reaching there
and the body was taken to the under
taking establishment of Clnycomb &
Anderson.

CHICKASHA ENJOYS
CHRISTMAS AND DELIGHTFUL DAY
Christinas was a day of cheer in
Chickasha and, needy and otherwise,
all enjoyed tho blessings of a beauti
ful day and a bountiful Santa Claus.
Many dinner parties added to the joys
of the season and hunting parties play
ed a large part in entertaining the
Chickasha sportsmen.
The poor and friendless were well
taken care of, provided for in many
ways, and Christmas trees both pri
vate and public were plentiful.
INSERT CHURCHES
The Other Churches
The Presbyterian, Episcopal, First
Baptist and other churches also had
pleasing Christmas programs.
INSERT ADD CHRISTMAS
With, the Xmas chopping days over,
all the stores reported this season to
be one of the best the retail market
has ever known.
All the extra help available had been
employed and still the clerks were
unable to givo prompt service to cus
tomers. Merchants more than ever
this year had their goods liberally dis
played, and to good advantage, which
was a wonderful help to the shopper.
Xmas decorations were in evidence in
almost every store. At Owsleys,
southern smilax. Arkansas ferns and
fibre roping in Xmas colors made the
store very attractive.
At Hunter's Booterie. a Christmas
tree decorated with house slippers,
stockings and tree decorations was
very pretty. The soda fountains have
winter s.cenes painted in white on the
mirrors and silvered cotton for snow.
At the Chickasha Gas and Electric
shop a revolving Xmas tree is the de
light of all the little folks as well as
the older ones. Xmas decorations and
colored electric lamps are on the tree
and on the floor around the tree are
many useful gifts of electrical descrip
tion. The Farmers Slate bank ordered a
big white thermometer, which they
were going to use for their decoration,
but when it arrived it was broken, and
was "respectfully laid away.".
Methodist Charities
The members of the Epworth Meth
odist church, with the assistance given
hy many friends played the part of

families of Chickasha during the past.

Washington, Doc. 2i" The settlement
of the difficulties between the United
States and Mexico by peaceful means
is believed to depend upon what un
swer Carranza gives on this, his last
day, for signing tho protocol for with
drawal of the American troops, us pro
vided ' for by tho American-Mexican
joint commission.
The official announcement was made
that the American government expir '.a
to hear from the first chief today as
to whether ho agrees to the proposed
terms for the withdrawal of tho troops.
If Carranza fails to sign tho protocol
as stipulated, tho sessions of tho joint
commission will end and this will leave
the situation as it was before the com
mission convened. It is thought that
it may mean, too, a firmer policy on
the part of this government in deal
ing with Mexico.

tho church, bought and gave to an
afflicted member a handsome rubber
tired invalid's chair. Another family
of the. church was happily remembered
but perhaps the greatest sight of all
was witnessed Sunday afternoon at
2:30 when more than twenty-five auto
mobiles gathered at the church to de
liver a Christmas pounding to all of
the poor families of the community.
Flour was stacked In sacks on tho
front walk, and several cases of syrup,
and thirty or forty backets of coffee,
