Football Weather Welcomes
Dodgers Home for Supreme
World's Championship Test.
FANS IN LINE BRAVE COLD
Bright Sun Helped Conditions as
Game Time Approached.
Speculators Lack Success.
NKW YORK. Oct. 10. New Yorlc
furnished Brand football weather for
the third world's scries game at Eb
bets Field today. A biting northwest
wind that played all sorts of havoc
with hats and skirts fairly knocked
the bottom out or tho thermometer.
There was a mercury drop of SO de
crees from high mark yesterday to
low mark today at 7:.10 a. m.
The wind diminished, slightly
toward afternoon, bringing with a
small rise In temperature. The mer
cury was 42 above at 10 o'clock.
The weather bureau promised cloud
less skies.
Shlverlnar In the cold blasts of a
stiff north wind, a crowd of nerv
1.000 Brooklyn fans stood In line
early today before the bleacher ticket
windows at Bbbets Field. Only a few
had spent tho night In line, however
At the morning wore on they came
In groups and slnglv, and before Un
gates were opened at 9 o'clock nenriv
1.000 persons were In front of the
windows.
Speculators Have Little Chance.
Speculators havo had little success In
Brooklyn, and only a few of the tickets
have found their way to other than fans
who want to see the games. However,
there are somo being offered for sale,
and at hugo prices.
One speculator was overheard to offer
an official of the Brooklyn club a bonus
of $3,000 If he would sell a block of
tickets. The offer drew only a laugh.
Game, willing and fighting all the
time, the Dodgers can to date number
themselves among their own worst ene
mies. They fought Boston to a stand
still, and then "beat themselves by
their own mistakes. A wobble In the In
field, a piece of bad base running, or n
slip In pitching and a chance has flown.
They have loot two games by a margin
of one run, and In both struggles they
went down with their flag flopping nt
Iho mast and their nerve unbroken right
up to tho lastgap,
Dodgers Are Fighters.
The Dodgers have shown their middle
name Is fight. The Bed Sox aro out to
make It four straight games and wind

Producers Expected to Divert
Large Part of Supply for
Two Cent Raise.
A talse of 2 cents per gallon In the
price of milk paid to the producers
In Baltimore Is looked upon as seri
ously menacing the Washington mar
kct by the diversion' of at least a
part of the local milk supply to
Baltimore. Its effect might be as seri
ous as a "milk strike" In Washing
ton.
Inquiry among the milk dealers nnd
producers In Washington today de
veloped the fact that a large part of
the supply of the local market comes
from points In Marylnnd from which
milk can be shipped as easily to Bal
timore. That lif milk nroducer who have
been shipping to Washington will send
some or tlielr supplies 10 uaiiimurc
to get the better price was admitted
today by those fnmlllar with the sit
uation. "We cannot say. of course, what the
producers will do," sulil one of the
dealers, "but It seems to be rather
obvious that they will ship to Haiti-,
more If thev can get a 'better price
theie and thereby will reduce the
supply In this city. I cannot say that
tho price- will bo raised in this city
unless there Is a serious shortage. At
the present lime thero Is plenty of
milk to be obtained at the prices we
are paying. I do not care to discuss
the Baltimore prices. That Is the
business of the Baltimore dealers
They know what their situation Is."

"I think It Is quite probable that
some of the producers In Maryland
will take advantage of the higher

milk to that city." suld Judson C.

BOSTON, Oct. 10.-Kxcept for the
howling forty-mile galo that swept In
from tho northeast, last night was the
most quiet night off the Now Kngland
coast since the German submarine U-&3
sailed out of Newport late Saturday.
Not a single vessel passing along the
"lane." off the Nantucket light ship
c rucked Its wireless or gave any other
sign of Iti presence. The German un
dersea monsters were equally quiet, and,
apparently, have vanished as suddenly
us they appeared.

New York Ship Brokers Declare
German Agents Boarded
U-53 in American Port.
Officials of the Amerlcun Govern
ment were advised today that charges
were being made In New York, that ".ho
communder of tho Geiman aubnuiiiuc
t'-M obtained at Newport, It. I., com
plete Infoi matlon upon whli It to plan
his successful attacks on lv meieluiut
ships.
These (ihatges, which have also been
bi ought to tho attention, iufoiiniilly, of
the Uiltlnh embassy, are regarded ns
serious in lew of the bearing they
might hap on a possible reversal by tho
United States of Its policy of permitting
Geiman submarines to visit Ameilcan
ports. In BiltUh circles It is held that
tho charges Involve u grave breaeh of
neutrality on the part of the port au
thorities at Newport.
It Is set forth In the assertions of
ship brokers In New York that among
the visitors who were allowed by the
German commander to board the sub
marine was at least one German secret
agent, armed with complete data con
cerning the schedule of sailings and
arrivals of British merchantmen.
it was to cover this mission. It is
hinted, that the German commander
resorted to the almost unprecedented
procedure of permitting all comers to
vi-u ami inspect tne submarine.
That German agents In this country
were fully Informed In advance of the
ai rival of the U-M Is confidently as
serted. In view of the full information
turnlshed them previously with respect
to the coming of the German merchant
submarine Dcutschland, and that they
were ready with all Information tho
commander needed, Is now charged.
Lansing Says Visit
Is Not Significiant
Denies Connection Between His
Presence In New York And
Gerard's Arrival.
NBW YORK, Oct. 10. Secietary of
State Lanslhg said today there Is
"nothing significant" In his appear
ance In New York on the day Am
bassador Geiuid arrived hero from
Berlin.
The Secretary Is stopping at the
Blltmore Just two or three blocks
from the llltz Carlton, where Ambas
sador Gerard went from the steamer.
German Ambassador Count von
Bernstorff also Is at tho Hit or he
was Immediately after his visit with
Prsdnt Wilson yestorday at Shadow
Lawn.
Secretary Lansing planned to leave
for Shadow L,awn at G o'clock to dis
cuss the new U-boat situation with
the President, Asked If ho would see
Gerard before he goes to Shadow
Lawn, ho Invariably replied!
"I hrve no appointment with Mr.
Gerard."
It Is State Department procedure,
for a returning ambassador "formal
ly" to see his Immediate superior
the Secretary of State before he pays
his formal respects to the President.
It was thought probable Gerard might
go to Shadow Lawn while Secretary
Lansing is there.

U. S. Warships Cover Area of
Fifty-five Miles Seeking Vio

STEAMER MAY NOT BE LOST
Belief Grows in New York That
Only Five Ships Were -Sunk
by Raider.
NEWPORT, Oct. 10. Eleven
American destroyers, steaming in a
line with five miles of rolling ocean
between them today swept the At
lantic off Nantucket where Ave or
six freighters were sunk by a Ger
man submarine last Sunday, in an
other effort to locate the crew of
the Kingston or Kingstonian.
When Admiral Gleaves ordered
the destroyers out-at 9:20 today he
admitted it would probably be- a
useless search after the all-night
gale and cold weather.
AREA OF 55 MILES.
The combing process started near
Montauk Point and swung eastward.
It covered a distance of flfty-flvs
miles north and south and out beyond
the Nantucket shoals lightship.
The Paulding was the flrst to get
away, leaving four minutes after the
order was lecelved and went e'.e ant
ing down Newport harbor at h spcod
of twenty-five knots. The sea was
choppy, but the amiosphere clear, en
abling each vessel to see tho next In
line.
The searchers were, besides the
Paulding, the Drayton. Jenkins. Fan
ning, Jarvls. McCall. Wadsworth.
Nicholson, Walnwrlght, PorUr, and
Conyngham.
Tho destroyers out last night failed
to locate any survlvora and Admiral
Gleavrs wus skeptical of the success
of the new expedition,
He planned, however, not to hare
them stay out longer than twenty
four hours, feeling that If such a ship
at. the Kingston was sunk and the
men are still alive they certainly will
be located In that time.
A radio dispatch to Admiral Gleaves
yestorday stated that the Conyngham
had picked up two survivors, but the
admiral said today that had been an
error In transmission and that so far
ns he knew no survivors had been
found.
BELIEF GROWS THAT
ONLY 5 SHIPS SANK
Shipping Circles Now Doubt Re
port oF Kingston's Loss.
XI JW YORK. Oct. 10 -Belief that only
five ship were sunk In the German sub
marine raid off Nantucket grew In ship
ping circles heie today, as vague and
contradictory reports concerning the
crow of the steamer Kingston were re
ceived. Thirty-six hours having elapsed since
the Kingston was supposed to have
bpen sunk without any trace of her
crew, steamship men were Inclined to
believe thp name of the vessel may
have been misread by wireless opera
tors nnd that no such ship as the King
ston was attacked.
Within tho last twelve hours an argu
ment has arisen as to whether the
name of tho ship supposed to have been
sunk win the Kingston or Kingstonian.
May Have Misread Name.
Capt. K. L. Yates, of the Uruguayan
steamer P. L. M., No. 4, which rescued
the crew of the British steamer Strath
dene, said he believed the name of the
Christian Knudson had been read
"Kingston" In some way when reports
wero transmitted by wireless,
It wns also pointed out that the steam
ers were sunk within a comparatively
small radius. The ciews of the five
Bhlpa known to have gone Jown wel
easily nnd speedily found by United
States destroyers.
In view of the core the German sub
mersible wns evidently taking to con
foi m to all requirements of International

three additional ships were reported as
sunk In wireless messages to all New
Kngliuid ppliyts early yestorday. The
