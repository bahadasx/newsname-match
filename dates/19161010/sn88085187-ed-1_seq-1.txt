MAN WHO KNOWS
BY W. G. SHEPHERD
(77k' Famous American II ar Correspondent.)
I have heen on every front in Europe and in every capital ex
cept Petrograd, On lhe fronts I have seen the horrors of war.
And in the capitals 1 have seen the efforts of the various fight
ing nations to draw ihe United States into the war.
ln war, thinking men become unthinkable beasts. Men of
business, science and achievement stop their work and heconie
mere physical units in an army. Youths drop their life dreams
and their futures. Ambitions crumble. Home and family
plans are swept aside.
Progress, whose figure we carve in marine lo decorate our
proud buildings, hecomes a withered, paralyzed wreck. The
hlight of hate reaches int., the innermost corner of every city,
of even- home, of every heart. WORSE THINGS THAN
DEATH FALL TO Till. LOT OF MILLIONS OF
HUMAN I.KLW.S IN WAR, inducting mental and moral
decay.
Into the situation which would produce these terrible
changes I have seen all the nations of Europe endeavor to
drag the United States.
Watched Europe Try to Tangle Us
From those capitals, ai ihe other end of the line. T have
watched Washington and the government there extricate the
United States from one plot after another, from one diabolical
machination after another.

NEWPORT, It. 1., Oct. 10. —
Eleven American destroyers,
steaming ln a line willi five miles

today swept the Atlantic off Nan

rlne last Sunday, In another ef

When Admiral Gleaves ordered
