LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct 10.—
Ambassador Gerard, who arrived in
New York this morning, bears no
message from Kaiser Wilhelm to
President Wilson suggesting Ameri
can Intercession in behalf of peace.
Nor doeta he come for the special pur
pose of discussing with the president,
reported revival of the submarine men
ace. It may be stated positively Ger
ard's trip to this country is made en
tirely at the suggestion of Secretary
of State Lansing, "in order to give the
American ambassador a much needed
vacation." As a matter of fact this in
vitation to come home didn't reach
Gerard until shortly before his ship
Sailed. He was in Copenhagen at the
time making preparations for Mrs.
Gerard's trip back to this country.
There is no doubt, of course, that
the president will want to know all
developments regarding the possibili
ties of peace in the near future and
regarding any preparations which

Body Found in Basement Where Murderer Had Carried

1 '^United Press Leased Wire Service]
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.—Strangled to death with the strap she used to carry her school
books, eleven year old Bella Bricker was found in the basement of a tenement building at
184 Monroe street today.
The little girl had been missing since she started for school yesterday morning. She
evidently was attacked on her way to school. Her clothing was badly torn and her face
bruised and covered with blood.
Morris Silverstein, the janitor who discovered the body, said he was in the cellar at
ten o'clock last night and saw nothing unusual. Detectives believe the girl was assaulted
and killed at some other place and her body dragged to the tenement building last night.

WASHINGTON, Oct 10.—Washing
ton officials, it w&s authoritatively
stated today have so far received no
report that leads them to believe any
inoident connected with the raid of
the U-53 off Nantucket Saturday night
and Sunday, was in the least a viola
tion of international law. All unoffi
cial advices, as well as official reports
so far received, agree thoroughly
with reports made to the navy de
partment.
Officials declared all evidence leads
them to believe the German boat
exercised most diligent
care not to trespass against interna
tional law. it was pointed out that
in every instance ample time was
given passengers and crew to take to
small boats that sinkings each time
occurred comparatively close to a
haven of safety and that there have
beenjio more torpedoings since rough
water has been whipped up by wind.
No Patrol Established.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.—Secre
tary of the Navy Daniels today de
nied he had established or at thiB
time proposed to establish a neutral
ity patrol along the north Atlantic
coast to prevent Infringement of this
country's rights by belligerent ves
sels.
It was merely a "report" Daniels
said. There is no intention now to
establish such a patrol. The destroy
ers now out were sent purely to save
life for no other reason. When this
work is accomplished, they will re
turn."
Rear Admiral Knight believes the
crew of the steamer Kingston has
been picked up by an outbound ves
sel, he reported today to the navy
department. He does not believe, he
said, that the crew has been lost,
principally bcause of the equalable
ness of the weather.

May Cut Cables.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.—Possibil
ity that German submarines operating
off the American coast may cut the
AtU ntic cables, crippling communica
tion with Europe or sow mines in
Tr»ns-Atla&Uc steamship lanes,
brought new menace into considera
tion today. What action the United
States could take if the Atlantic
cables were cut is a matter of doubt,
officials said. When British forces
destroyed German cables, no action
was taken 'by the United States.
Hold Up Immigrants.

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 10.^-Except for
the howling forty mile gale that swept
in from the northeast, last night was
the most quiet night off the New
England coast since the German sub
marine U-53 stood out of Newport
late Sunday. No vessels passing along
the "lane" off the Nantucket lightship
cracked their wireless or gave any
other sign of their presence. The Ger
man undersea monsters were equally
quiet and apparently have vanished as
suddenly as they appeared.
The Nantucket radio station report
ed that "all keys were silent" through
out the night and the Charlestown
nevy yard station said they had little
to do and heard nothing from the vi
cinity of the boat zone. No word
has been heard of the French-Canad
lon liner Great City, cargoed with con
traband and bound for St. Nazaire,
France. She left Boston early Monday
morning and was due to pass through
the "submarine war zone" some time
rast night.
The American-Hawaiian liner Kan
san, the only liner carrying munitions
for the allies that escaped being sunk
by the submarine, although her papers
were examined Sunday, has not left
her pier in Charlestown. The French
Canadian line office declares that the
shipment of horses which she stopped
here for 9n her way from New York
to St. Nazaire has"delayed her start,
but it is felt that the kaiser's under
sea navy ig the real cause.
"WTien it became known that the
Kansan stopped at Boston to take on
more grain and two thousand horses,
it was the belief in shipping circles
that one of the boats intended to
"lay" for her when she left Boston.
The Kansan is an American register
ed vessel, but is under charter to the
French-Canadian line.
Shell Across Bow.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.—A shell
across her bow, comanding her to
heave to, was the first knowledge the
British steamer Strathdene had of the
presence of a iJ boat near the Ameri
can coast. Captain Wilson declared
today. The submarine then signalled
"abandon your ship," shelled the
Strathdene after her crew had pulled
away and finally sent her to the bot
tom with a torpedo when shell fire
failed to sink her.

Naval Officers Express Opinion That
But One Submarine
Boat Is .Re
aponsible.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.T
NEWPORT, it. I., Oct. 10.—Al
though Admiral Gleaves received &'
radio from the Conyngham that two
of the missing crew of the Kingston
had been picked up off Nantucket
lightship late yesterday, they had not:
been landed here at an early hour
this imornlng.
A radio dispatch to Admiral Gleaves
yesterday stated that the Conyngham
had picked up two survivors, but the
admiral said today that there had
been an error in transmission and
that so far as he knew no survivors
had been found.
Naval officers united todaj^jp ex
pressing the opinion voiced by Asd
iKlral Gleaves that only- one'Germaif
tl boat la responsible for the sinking
of the six merchantmen.
Yesterday no word of the German
raider reached here. The American
destroyers which returned late last
night reported no signs of her or ot
her activities.
A recall order sent out late last
night by Admiral Gleaves, called all
but one of the destroyers back from
Nantucket and they began arriving
here just before dayligM. The pos
sibility that the search for the King
ston's crew would be renewed from
here today depended largely, naval
officers said, on weather conditions.
No official information as to today's
movements of the destroyers waa
given out.
A report that ten Chinese, menu
bers of the crew of the Strathdene,
were being brought here, proved to
be without foundation today. The
presence of an' unusual number ot
Chinese sailors along the water front
accounted for the rumor.
No Such Vessel, Perhaps.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.—Belief that
only five ships were sunk in the Ger
man submarine raid off Nantucket
grew in shipping circles here today
as vague and contradictory reports
concerning the crew of the steamer
Kingston were received.
Thirty-six hours having elapsed
since the Kingston was supposed to
have been sunk without any trace of
her crew, steamship men were in
clined to believe the name of the
vessel may have been misread by
wireless operators and that no such
vessel as the Kingston was attacked.
Within the last twelve hours, an
argument has arisen as to whether
the name of the ship supposed to
have been sunk was the Kingston
or Klngstonian. Captain E. L. Yates
of the Uruguyan steamer^ P. L. M.
number 4, which rescued* the crew
of the British steamer Strathdene,
said he believed the name of the
Christian Knudsen had been misread
Kingston in some way when reports
were transmitted by wireless.
It was also pointed out that all of
the freighters were sunk within a
comparatively small radius. The
crews of the five ships known to
have gone down were easily and
speedily found by United States de
stroyers. In view of the care the
German submersible was evidently
taking to conform to all requirements
of international law in giving the
crews ample time to take to their
small boats, it is also pointed out that
it hardly seems reasonable that the
