NEW YORK, Oct. 10. Returning
from Berlin aboard the liner Freder
ick VIII. Ambassador James W. Ge
rard today refused to answer any
yurfttons relating to the purpose of
Hi Tisit, saying that even the simp
lest question might "involve" him.
"Is it true that you have brought a
message from Kaiser Wilhclm to
President Wilson," he was asked.
"I cannot answer that question,"
replied Gerard. "To reply to any
question of that nature might involve
me."
The ambassador's attention was
called to an article from a New York
newspaper declaring positively that
he brought no such message but came
to warn President Wilson that Ger
many was preparing to resume its
submarine warfare. He was asked if
this was a correct statement. I can
not answer that, was his reply. He
said he did not know when he would
see President Wilson.
By United Tress.
LONG BRANCH, N. J.. Oct. 10.
Ambassador Gerard, who arrived in
New York today, bears no message
from Kaiser Wilhelm to President
Wilson suggesting American inter
cession in behalf of peace. Nor does
he come for the special purpose of
discussing with the President the re
""ported revival of the submarine men
ace. "It may be stated positively that
Gerard's trip to this country is made
entirely at the suggestion of Secre
tary of State Lansing in order to give
the ambassador a much-needed vaca
tion," said a high official today.
No da'e has been set for Gerard to
see the President. The President will
leave for Indianapolis early tomorrow
evening and will make two addresses
there Thursday. He will not return
until late Friday. It is likely Gerard
will not see the President before next J
week.
Secretary Lansing came to Shadow
Lawn late today to confer with the
President Owing to activities of the
German submarine U-"3 along the
American coast Sunday, his visit has
aroused great interest.
Ambassador Jusserand thi3 after
noon presented to the President the
French government's reply to Presi
dent Wilson's personal appeal to urge
co-operation to help starving Poland.

he believed the name of the Chris

It is also pointed out that all of
the steamers were sunk within a
comparatively small radius. In view
of the fact that the German submer
sibles were evidently careful to -see
that all requirements of international
law were observed in giving the crews
ample time to take to their boats, it
is also pointed out that it seems rea

All Merchants in Rebate
Campaign Report Increase
in Business.
Moberly, Higginsville, Fulton, Harts
burg, Fayette, and Mexico were all
represented among the purchasers
who today took advantage of Colum
bia's Trade Week.
"One purchaser from Stephen's
Store told me that the Missourlan had
done good work in advertising Trade
Week, ind a large number were plan
ning to come to Columbia later in the
week," was the report of one of the
Victor Barth Clothing Company's
force this afternoon.
Six of the leading stores offering
the Trade Week refund reported over
twenty-five rebate slips had been
given out up to 3 o'clock this after
noon. Leading the list was the C.
B. Miller Shoe Company, which has(
given out twelve slips. Six purchasers
at the Strawn-Neate Dry Goods Com
pany purchased over $100 worth of
merchandise.
A customer for Columbia stores
from a town forty-eight miles away
this is the long distance record for'
the first day of Trade Week- yester
day. This customer, a young lady from
Auxvasse, spent a total of J35.25 at
three Columbia stores.
The first three shoppers to pre
sent their rebate slips at the M5s
sourian office yesterday had traveled
a total of 10S miles to take advantage
of the opportunity to save their rail
road fare offered by Trade Week.
The ultimate aim of Trade Week is
to increase the selling field of Colum
bia merchants. The stock of goods
carried by the stores of Columbia is
sufficiently up-to-date and complete to
satisfy the needs of the most particu
lar within a radius of 100 miles. Re
sults have already been obtained from
a town half that distance away. An
inquiry as to the amount of rebate
that would be received by one com
ing from a town 71 miles from Co
lumbia was received early this morn
ing. Friends have been busy telephon
ing to the Missourian for details of
the Trade Week plan in order to urge
friends in nearby towns to visit them
and get their railroad fare paid by
purchasing their fall equipment here.
It you have not invited the friend
you are so anxious to have visit you.
it is not too late jet. You will never
have a better argument by which to
persuade him or her to visit you than
the one offered by Trade Week. If
there is anything about the method of
obtaining the rebate or the amount
of purchases necessary, to get the
complete fare refunded, call the Mis
sourian office. The opportunity to
save railroad fare is open until mid-
'nisht Saturday.

CM HAVE CLUB HE
O. M. Barnett, Founder of
Scdalia Organization, Sees
Success.
Orville M. Barnett, University at
torney, thinks that the people of Co
lumbia are of the type who would
most enjoy a country club and make
it a success. Mr. Barnett was one
of the founders of the Sedalia Country
Club twelve years ago and remained
a member until he came to Columbia
a year ago last March.
"Our beginning in Sedalia was a
very modest one," said the attorney.
"We used the fair grounds for our
golf links, so it was only necessary
to buy a lot for our house. The land
and house together cost us JC.000 and
we raised the money by issuing stock
at $23 a share.
"Six rears later we sold our house
and lot for exactly what we had paid
for it and bought sixty acres of land,
at $130 an acre not far from our old
site. We then put up a $12,000 club
house and now we have paid off all
except $3,000 of the total expenditure
of $21,000. The initiation fee is .$25
and annual dues are $23. The club's
membership is usually about one hun-
. .
"I don't think that too much em
phasis should be laid upon athletics
or there is danger that the club will
be a benefit only to golf and tennis
players. The Sedalia Country Club
has a standing social committee which
arranges for dances, card parties an'
other entertainments to be given
regular intervals. From May ur
November a chef is kept at the
and anyone can give a dinner ;
on a minute's notice.
"There is a street car line
goes past the club house, so mr
ship is not limited to owners o."
mobiles. In a town like Coluin.....
which doesn't have street car services,
I think the club should be within easy
walking distance. Last .week I played
golf at the Hannibal Country Club,
which is two miles from town, and
club members there who do not own
cars have to make use of the "jitney
Me Tifirnotf hna vlcitorl thn rnnntrr
. ... .. ... j i
clubs at Springfield, Trenton, Joplin,
Hannibal and Jefferson City, and he
says- that it has been his experience
that a club once started in a small
town not only continues, but that in
terest in it steadily grows, and that
there is no difficulty in maintaining
the membership.

ager Robinson to bring victory to
the Dodgers today .and though the
"Iron Man" was relieved by Pfeffer

a home run, the Dodgers held their
lead until the end and triumphed over
the Red Sox in the third game of the

for the game.
Carrigan chose Mays to make it
three straight with his underhand de
