WILSON'S SPLENDID GUIDANCE OF
NATION IS BECKHAM'S THEME
ii ... 4
Senator Eloquently Recounts the Great Achievements of the President
CALM COURSE CONTRASTS
Record of Democratic Administration One of Finest in American History
i:.- h
Senator J. C. W. Beckham open
ed the campaign for President
Wilson in McLean county Snturday
before one of tho largest audiences
that has hoard a political speaker in
that section of the State in many
years.
There have been persistent re
quests from Western Kentucky that
Senator Beckham begin tho most
important part of his speaking
tour in that section of the State,
where he has always been very
strong politically, and the address
as made by Kentucky's junior Sen
ator made a fine impression.
Substance of Address
Tho address of Senator Beckham
in part follows:
No party ever came before tho
American people in a presidential
campaign with a better record or a
stronger case than the Democratic
party presents to the people in this
'campaign. Democrats confidently
and unhesitatingly claim, and in
telligent independent voters and
many fair-minded Republicans ad
mit, that the administration of our
Federal government for the last
three and a half years has never
been excelled in the history of this
country, in the wisdom of its con
duct, in the number and importance
of its far-approaching nnd benefi
cial legislative reforms, in the ad
mirable anu patriotic manner in
which it has managed our relations
with foreign countries under the
most difficult nnd, at times, dan-'
gerous circumstances, and in its
many splendid achievements for
the advancement of the welfare
and happiness of tho great common
people of our land. It has fully
justified the faith of those voters
who by their suffrage placed it in
power nearly four years- ago, and
by its remarkable course in a mo
mentous period in the world's his
tory, it has won the unreserved ap
proval of that large body of Am
erican citizens, who aro indepen
dent in politics, who are not influ
ence'd by partisan prejudices, and
who have grown so in numbers and
strength in recent years, that thoy
can turn the tide of battle either
way in a national election.
Henry Ford's Statement
Henry Ford has been tho most
remarkable figure in the industrial
world for some years. " His extra
ordinary genius has established tho
largest and most successful manu
facturing plant on earth. IIo has
always beea a Republican, and in
tho primaries in his State, Michi
gan, before tho National Republi
can convention of last June the
Republican voters of his State, by
a substantial majority, gavo liinl
tho instructions in that state for
tho Republican nomination for tho
presidency, oven when he was not
a candidate and was not seeking
tho nomination. Hero Mr. Beckham
quotes Mr. Ford and continued:
I might quote Thos. A. Edison,
Prof. Irving Fisher, and many oth
er leaders of thought, and men of
genuis and achievement, to the
same purpose. But what is tho
ufeo of adding to what I havo al
ready given? Are not tho opinions
of these men, impartial and unin
fluenced by any selfish or partisun
motives, worth moro to the voters
in making up their minds how to
vote in tho coming election, than
the ill-tempered and warlike utter
ances of Col. Roosevelt, deeply dis
appointed in his uncontrollable am-
WITH HUGHES' DELUSIONS
bition to again wield the big stick
from tho White House or the child
ish nnd petulunt attacks against
the Democratic administration,
made by Judge Hughes, the candi
date without an issue?
A Successful Administration
The sober and impartial judg
ment of a large majority of the in
telligent nnd patriotic people of this
country will pronounce that admin
istration to havo been unparalleled
and conspicuous in its successful
conduct of the affairs of the na
tion. History will so write it, nnd
posterity must commend nnd praise
it, because within these brief years
of its cxistenco so far wo have
come to a turning point in tho
world's history, and the hand that
has guided us through such peril
ous experiences has kept us in the
pathway of peace and safety and
progress. Is it wise to take that
hand from the helm before we have
reached the end of the hard jour
ney is it the custom or passen
gers on a ship, when a pilot has
safely carried them through tho
storm and tempests of the sea, to
throw him overboard and substitute
in his place an untrained and inex
perienced mnn for tho place? Docs
thoarmer, or the merchant, or
thejrbnnker, discharge a faithful
nnd efficient servant, just to give
the place to some untried fellow,
who hnppens to want the job? Do
you know of nny successful busi
ness concern that follows tho prac
tice of dismissing its manager, who
has capably and satisfactorily con
ducted its business, simply to grat
ify the appetite of some hungry of
fice seeker?
Then,' what reason on earth can
there be to displace Woodrow Wil
son with Charles E. Hughes, unless
it be to satisfy, if possible, tho in
ordinate creed for office of those
back of the candidacy of Mr.
Hughes? What principle do they
represent? Their most resourceful
leaders can point to none. What
issue do thoy present? Tho most
powerful-political microscope has
so far been unable to discover a
single one.
Democracy's Cause
The cause of the Democratic
party in this campaign should ap
peal not only to Democrats, but to
all good citizens in our land. The
great mass of tho people, who take
no nctivo part in politics, aro not
intnri'.sted in tho mere victory of
one party over another, but they
should be deeply interested in tho
proper administration of their pub
lie affairs and in the cuuso of good
government. They should reward
that party, or those men, who havo
well and faithfully served them.
Thoy should look upon such mat
ters not as partisans, but as pa
triots. If this Democratic admin
istration has made tho excellent
record which many believe it has,
then it is entitled to the overwhelm
ing endorsement of tho American
people. It should bo continued in
power, not so much as an endorse
ment of what it has done, but be
cause what it has done has shown
it to be superior to its rival in ca
pacity and purposo for further
good service to tho people.
