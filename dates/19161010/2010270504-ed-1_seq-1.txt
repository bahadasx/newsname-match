INITIAL 3I0VE FOll NEW
SOUTH PLATTE BRIDGE
The initial movo toward a now stato
aid bridgo across tho South Platte
rlvor south of town will bo mado this
week, when a petition asking for the
submission of a bond proposition will
bo circulated. Tho matter is taken up
at this time for tho roason that a now
bridge Is needed, tho condition of tho
old bridgo having reached 'a point
where it will soon bo condemned ns
being unsafo, and for Alio further roa
son that stato aid Ih now obtainable,
whereas in a year or so it cannot bo
secured. Thoro is a goncral belief
that tho coming legislature will ro
peal the present state aid bridgo law,
on Alio ground that so comparatively
fow counties recoivo any benoflt, while
all counties contribute in taxes. Tho
counties not benefitted naturally ob
ject to paying taxes for an object
from which tthey receive no direct
benefit.
Tho present bridgo may last a year
or two, probably not so long, and as
a now ono must bo built soonor or lat
er, It is considered the wlso plan to
take advantago of tho state aid law,
under which tho state pays half of tho
cost of tho structure.

Dear Madam': .
It is the fixed policy-of this store to offerits ptftrons the best
possible service , and it was in keeping with this policy that we have Just
engaged the services of Mrs. Beckton a graduate of the Gossard. training
school. Mrs. Beckton was recommended to us very highly as a woman of large
experience in the fitting of their corsets. At the time we engaged her
services she was employed as Corsetiere in one of the large State Street
Stores in Chicago which should be recomendation enough. Gossard Corsets
are the standard by which all other front lace corsets are, compared. They
give beauty of form and a grace of carriage that is not equaled in any other
line. VVThey also are a great help to majiy, ladies that need the support that
this class of a corset alone can give . There are many Gossard models for
j" . "
every type of figures at $2. 00 , . $3 . 50 , $5.00 and up. If you spend only
$2.00 or; $3.50 for your Gossard Corset you will re.ceive the same scientific
f ittingUer.vice as' though you selected a $10 .00model . It will be intorest-
ing for you to come,iiin and talk over these matters with; Mrs . Beokton and
will be considered a favor by us. ,
