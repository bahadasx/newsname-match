Gainer Scores Most Expensiye
Run in Baseball History.
Ending Monday's Game in Tie
Would Have Meant Fortune.
Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, Oct. 10.-
Score the longest hit in history for
Dell Gainer. He knocked eighty
thousand dollars from Braves field to
Ebbets field late Monday. If you
don't believe it get out here and watch
it rolling into the box office.
Two inches above or two below and
Dell's bat might have fanned instead
of driving in McNally with the win
ning run. The game would have been
called on account of darkness, the tie
would have been played in Boston to
day and Bill Carrigan, the club own
ers, players and others involved would
have shoved their hands in their
pockets tomorrow and said:
"My goodness, here's an extra $S0,
000 we didn't know we had."
Ball players are getting prosperous
and plutocratic, but gosh, lambasting
an independent fortune from Massa
chusetts to New York Is going a little
too far.
Gainer not only knocked the eighty
thousand dollars from Boston to
Brooklyn, but right out of the pockets
of his fellow players, his boss, and the
national commission. Had the game
ended in a tie, the series would have
been certain to go three more games
and today's gate receipts would have
been a whopper in which the players
would have shared. As it Is the teams
will now play in a smaller park, the
crowd can't be as large and should
the Red Sox win today and tomorrow
the series will wind up In four games.

New York, Oct. 10. A day and

anxiety in shipping circles caused by
the activities of the submarine com

North Atlantic highway off Nan
tucket. If anything the disappearance
of the German t-boat and the mys
tery regarding her present location in
creased the precautions taken by
owners and agents of vessels of the
entente nations. Transatlantic liners
and freight steamers approached this
port today by unusual courses which
carried them far out of the customary

stake in the game of hide and seek
which may be going on off shore.

raid and the consequent advance of
the insurance rates on transatlantic
transportation -amounting in some
cases to 500 per cent will check ship

Word was received from New Or

pany won in the supreme court to
day in its fight against the utilities
commission when the supreme court
denied the application for an In
junction against the gas company
asked by the commission.
Even the Kansas supreme court ap
peared disgruntled at the endless gas
litigation today and issued instruc
tions to attorneys for the Kansas Nat
ural Ga3 company and utilities com
mission to cut long-winded arguments
short. By doing this it is considered
probable that the court will be able
to hand down a decision late this aft
ernoon in an action brought before it
by the utilities commission.
This time it is a hearing of one law
suit that might prevent the supreme
court from sitting in two other law-
Euits. It became apparent this morn
ing that the gas case has become so
tangled in the legal maze that the
attorneys have to stop and go thru
lot of legal papers to find out what
case, of tho myriad pending, is being
neaw.
The further entangling legal proce
dure was brought before the court by
the utilities commission today. Some
time ago tne commission filed two ap
plications for writs of mandamus
against the receiver for the Kansas
Natural. One was to compel him to
file a schedule of boiler rates and the
other was to require the receiver to
obtain the approval of the commission
before the change in the Olathe gas
rate is made.
After two cases were filed the re
ceiver and his attorneys went into the
federal court and asked for an injunc
tion preventing ihe utilities commis
sion from pushing the two suits in the
state court. Then the utilities com
mission went into the supreme court
and asked for an injunction to stop
the receiver and hit attorneys from
puaiiniB nujy.irat.iui. iur an injunc-
tion in the federal court. It is this
injunction that the supreme court is
hearing today.

NEWPORT A SUBMARINE BASE?

U. S. Protests ot Responsible
for $6,000,000.Loss.
Washington, Oct. 10. The United
States has refused to accept the con
tention of the entente allies urging;
that neutrals deny the use of their
harbors to all submarines whetner
merchantmen or warships. Counsellor
Polk of the state department an
nounced today.
The allied government in a memor
andum to neutral powers called atten
tion to "the grave danger incurred by
neutral submarines in the navigation
of regions frequented by belligerent
submarines "
Counsellor Polk refused to discuss
the reason for tho department's posi
tion. The American reply will not bo
made public before the return of Sec
retary Lansing from the summer
White Houtie Wednesday or Thursday.
Is I'nited States Responsible.
The claim of the allies that submar
ines are outlaws, as the note cabled
last night from London shows,
brought up the question of whether
the American government may be
sued for damages resulting from ths
call of the German submarine U-53
at Newport before she started on her
spectacular raid against commerce.
Under the interpretation of the al
lies, the position may be taken that
Newport was made the be.se for opera
tions which official estimate already
have caused at least J 6.000.000 dam
age to allied shipping and trade.
Any attempt to collect damages,
however, would probably be most
vigorously opposed by this govern
ment, which holds that a warrhip has
a right to enter a neutral harbor and
tnat tne u-bt in no way attempted to
make Newport a base.
Conformed With War Law, -
Washington. Oct. 1 Washington
officials it wu.3 stated today have so
far received no report that leads them
to believe any incident connected
with the raid of the U-53 off Nan
tucket Saturday night and Sund.iv was
in the least a violation of international
law. All unofficial advices an well
as official reports so far received agree
witn reports made to the navy de
partment. Officials declared all evi
dence leads them to believe the Ger
man U-boat commander exercised
most diligent care not to tresoass
against international law.
It was pointed out that In everv In
stance ample time was given passen
gers and crew to take to small boats
that the sinkings each time occurred
comparatively close to a haven of
safety and that there have been no
more torpedoings since rough water
has oeen whipped up by wind.
