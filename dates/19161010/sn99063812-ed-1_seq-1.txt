Collected From Hahl Iiiid.
A storm broke last night In the
council chambers of tho city hall
when ? Police .Judge- LeavlttThaoLf In'
Ished reading a petition from the
Klamath Commercial Club, nsklnc
that tho council exempt from city
taxes a tract of land near Shipping
ton nnd another south of Sixth atrect.
Councilman U. R. Doty of tho Fifth
ward caused most 'of tho storm, but
ho made up for tho silence of tho
others. To quiet things, Councilman
O. 1). Matthews moved that the mat
ter bo roferrcd to City Attorney It.
C. Oroc8beck Tor an opinion. The
council voted yea on this motion.
But the mater could rot be ua
usldo until Councilman Doty had lot
ii be known distinctively Just how
ho aloud on the propoaitlon.
"Aasoasmenta and bond laaues for
Howors and tho city hall are agalnat
that property and you can't remove
It from the tax rolls. The holders of
the bonds would bave you Into court
In no tlmo," said Doty.
"1 don't understand that It Is tho
purpose of this petition to have the
tracts of land cleared from any as
sessments against It. Tho petitioners
see only to hnvo it exempted from
annuul tuxes," said City Attorney
Orocsbeck. When bo asked it that
wero correct, simultaneously from
Fred Fleet and J. W, Siemens, secre
tary and prealdent of the commercial
club, came the respense:
"Yea, that Is all."
Judging from' City Attorney Qroes
beck's statement .last night, he prob
ably will report that there are no
legal objections to exempting' the
the property, from annual taxes. Mr.
Doty has made himself unmistakably
plain. A real, scrap is anticipated
