Von Falkenhayn's Forces Sweeping
Them Out of the Province
CAPTURE ISLAND IN DANUBE
Russians Gain Ground Near Kovel and
Lemberg But Sustain Heavy
Losses.
London, Oct. 9. Rumania's peril of
Invasion grows with today's news of
her disastrous Transylvanian cam
paign. Von Falkenhayn's Bavarians
have captured Toerzburg, southwest
of Kronatadt, the entrance to the
Toerzbuig pass, which leads through
the Transylvanian Alps to the Ruman
ian plan.
"The enemy is rolling back on the
whole .line," says the German official
statement. "In eastern Transylvania
we continue to march ;ahead. The Ru
manians were beaten in the battle of
Kronstadt. He-enforcements arrived
from the north in vain and joined th
combat northeast of Kronstadt."
Von Macken sen, too, struck quick
ly in the south while Von Falkenhayn
was sweeping the Rumanians out of
Transylvania. The German field mar
shal has captured by surprise attack
an Island in the Danube northwest of
the Bulgarian city of Sistova, a little
southweRt of Bucharest. The island
is opposite the Rumanian city of
Zimnitzea, rfom whicn runs a railroad
that an invading army would find use
ful. Two Rumanian officers, 156 men
and six guns were captured on the is
land. London, Oct. 9. At frightful cost
the Russians have pushed forward
their lines a few hundred yards nearer
to Kovel and Lemberg, the War Office
in Petrograd reports. Fighting of ex
traordinary stubbornness continues at
two points on the eastern front, in
which the gains are measured by feet
as often as by yards.

New York, Oct. 9. Under an order
obtained from the Supreme court to
day John J. Dillion, state commission
er of foods and markets, and the Dairy
men's league will be required to show
cause why they should not be "res
trained from Interfering with or in
timidating" milk producers from do
ing business with the Sheffield Farms
Slawson -Decker company, one of the
large distributing concerns here.
The company alleged conspiracy In
restraint of trade and stifling of com
petition. It charged that Commission
er Dillion had publicly stated that the
company would receive no milk ex
cept through the Dairymen's league.
The milk situation in New York
showed improvement today, between
50 and GO per cent of the normal sup
ply being received. An official of
one of the distributing companies
which refused to sign a contract with
the Dairymen's league asserted to
night that between 150,000 and 200,000
cows would be required to produce
enough milk to supply that concern's
patrons and would necessitate an out
lay of $10,000,000 should the proposed
project to establish barns within the
city be undertaken. This capital
would immediately be available, lie
said.

Pittsfield Merchant Tailor Expired
Suddenly Monday Afternoon.
David X. Nolmer. fiO, a merchant

CLAM UNDER PURE FOOD FIRE
Inquiry Started to Make Good Ones
Out of Bad Ones.
Washington, Oct. 6. 'nvestigation
of the clam has been undertaken by
pure food experts of the Department
of Agriculture. Dr. Carl 1,. Alsberg,
chief of the bureau cf chemistry, who
Is directing the inquiry, says that
scientists believed that the clam to
be even more subject to pollution than
the oyster, which now is considered
virtually iree from disease as a result
of the interstate shipment regulations
instituted by the Department.
The clam is more or less mysterious
to Federal investigators. Little is
known regarding its so-called habits.
The investigation is expected to de
velop what these are, as well as what
methods, if any, may be employed to
make good clams out of bad ones.
Oysters In polluted waters may be
cleansed by being transplanted for a
couple of weeks in waters that are
pure. Most of the clams consumed
in this country are taken from waters
close to shore during the Bummer and
fall, when the danger of pollution
from sewage Is greatest.
The scallop also is under investiga
tion. CASTORIA

GERMANS LOSE SOMME TRENCH
British Use Gas to Break Opposition
of Germans and Take Some

London, Oc t. 9. Hugar resistance is
growing weaker on both wings of the
150 mile battle line in Macedonia.
Serb troops in the west and British in
the east have forced the troops of
Czar Ferdinand to retreat before them
and have won important successes.
The Serbs, in force, have cut their
way across the Hiver Cerna at two

by the German official statement from
Berlin. Hreaking down the strong de

the Serbians captured the village and
with it 200 Hulgars. The invigorated
Serbian army is now within striking

The British have pushed forward

London, Oct. 9. German efforts to

and French beat back every counter
attack and the British advanced a lit

Today's German statement conflicts

HEAVY STORM PREVENTS SEARCH
Undersea Craft Which Sunk Six
Steamers off American Coast
Has Disappeared.
Nanntucket, Oct. 10. A 40-mile gale
off the island today makes further
search for the crew of the British
freighter Kingston of Kingstonlan, tor
pedoed and sunk by the German sub
marine Sunday impossible. Little
hope remains that the crew may still
be riding the waves in their life
life boats. The submarine has com
pletely disappeared.
Newport, R. L. Oct. 10. The whole
sale raid on foreign shipping south of
Nantucket lightship Sunday was the
Work of one submarine, according
to reports of American naval officers.
Rear-Admiral Albert Gleaves, com
manding the torpedo boat destroyer
flotilla which did such remarkably
speedy rescue work Sunday, said last
night that the reports of all his offi
cers agreed that to the best of their
observation one raider only was con
cerned. This boat, presumably, was the
German U-53, which called at Newport
Saturday afternoon to mail a letter
to Embassador Bernstorff and then
put to sea without taking on an ounce
of supplies, although she was 17 days
from her base, according to the state
ment of her officers.
Admiral Cleaves said he could
easily understand the positive state
ments ol the captain of the Nantucket
lightship and of sailors of the torpe
doed vessels that more than one sub
mersible was concerned. The U-boat,
he said, was very fast and appeared
to have been handled cleverly. It
easy, he pointed out, for her to disap
pear on one side of a ship and then
show up unexpectedly at another spot.
Doubtless, he believed, she had sub
merged and reappeared often enough
to mislead any but a keen profession
al observer, and to create the impress
ion that more than one sea terror was
operating.
Ten more refugees were landed at
Newport last night by the Melville,
lender of the destroyer flotilla, w hich
picked up 10 Chinese members of the
crew of the steamer Strathdene. They
were sent to the training station to
be held until Immigration Inspectors
tan pass upon their cases, after which
they probably will be transferred to
New Ytirk.
Destroyers swept the waters for a
wide area yesterday in a vain search
for the crew of the steamer Kingsto
nlan, who were seen by members of
the steamer Strathdene to take to
their boats before their vessel was
sunk. Rear-Admiral Knight, com
mandant of the Narraganansett bay
naval defense district, did not appear
!o be alarmed at the lack of success
in finding the missing men, and saw
no reason to change the previous re
ports that the raid so destructive to
property was accomplished without
loss of life. It was the commandant's
opinion that the Klngstonian's crew
had been picked up by an east-bound
steamer which did not dare to divulge
her position to lurking submarines by
reporting the tact by wireless.
.1, A, Andrews, who is connected
with the Grenfell mission in Labrador
was one of four Stephano, passengers
taken to the home of Mrs. Cornelius
Vanderbilt. Dr. Andrews was on his
way to New York. In describing his
experiences Dr. Andrews declared that
the Germans gave the boat proper
warning and then stood by until all
of the passengers had been taken off.
"Officers of the United States torpedo
boat destroyer which had arrived in
time to take care of tfio passengers of
the Stephano visited the steamer," he
said, "to make sure that all of the pas
sengers and crew were safe. Then
members of the German crew boarded
her and opened .her wntercocks." He
said no torpedo was discharged.
When Lleut-Capt. Hans Rose went
warring on enemy shipping be placed
the submarine U-53 in a position to
command both the Incoming and the
outgoing lane of what is known as
the "outside course" of Atlantic trnv

45 miles south of Nantucket island.
Pet ween tho Island and t ho lightship

have been in midocean.
No definite word had been received
up to noon yesterday of the fate of a
vessel recorded in wireless dispatches
Sunday as the British steamer Kings
ton, one of the victims of German
submarine attacks inthe vicinity of
the Nantucket lightship Sunday and
Sunday night. These men, who were
thought in Boston to have left tneir
ship before she was sunk, were re
ported to have been rowing their
small boats some 30 miles off the
lightship early iir the day but a num
ber of the United States torpedo
boat destroyers cruised over a large
radius during Monday without sending
ashore any message that they had
found the Kingston's crew.
The story cf how ships came with
in range of the U-boat raider so fast
off Nantucket that she had to keep
one waiting while she disposed of an
other was told at Newport, R. I., yes
terday by Arthur Gray, wireless oper
ator on tho Norweign steamer Chris
tian Knudsen. The Knudsen was sunk
about 9 o'clock yesterday morning -and
the crew rowed about in small boats
for 10 hours before being picked up by
a boat from the Nantucket shoals
lightship.
"We heard the sounds of firing some
time before the submarine hove in
sight," Gray said, "but we had no
idea what it all meant. By the time
we had discovered a submarine was
operating in our vicinity it was too
late to escape. When we came on to
the scene of action the undersea boat
was engaged with the British steamer
Stephano. While the passengers and
crew of the Stephano were disem
barking the U-boat ran alongside the
Knudsen and ordered us to steam
over nearer the Stephano.
"While the submarine was along
ride the Knudsen waiting for the cap
tain to take his papers aboard ; One
of the United States destroyers cau.e
into view. Almost immediately the
submarine disappeared beneath the
water and remained there until (t!38
destroyer came near enough to be rec
ognized as a neutral vessi'l when siji?
immediately camo to the surface and
continued her work.
"We were told to park up our be
longings and leave the ship, which
we at once began to do. We had plenty
of time to get off while the submarine
was disposing of the other vessel. We
had rowed sopie distance away before
the submarine fired on the Knudsen.
She fired at. least 150 shots and these
not having the desired effect she cut
loose a torpedo which struck the ves
sel amidships and she soon went

Brooklyn made ready last night to
take its place for the time being as
the' baseball center of the universe.
The shift called for by the world's ser
ies schedule bring3 the battling teams
to Ebbet's field for the third game of
the big set and gives the loyal legions
of Brooklyn rooters their first oppor
tunity to rally in force in vociferous
support of their favorlties.
That they were preparing to make
the most of it was evident, from tho
demand for tickets for the games to
be played at the home of the National
league champions. The Brooklyn club
announced that all the boxes and vir
tually all the reserved seats, provid
ing accommodations for abou 24,000
persons, had been sold. All that re
mained to be disposed of were some
2000 unreserved seat3 that had been
provided in temporary bleachers of
the circus variety erected In left field
Plans for an equal number along tho
opposite field wall had been canceled
because of the realization that their
erction would objectionably shorten
the already short right field, the
fence hounding which offers a tempt
ing mark for the home-run hitters,
whose solid raps frequently surmount
tho barrier.
Last night there was every indica
tion that the 2000 field seats would
be grabbed up as quickly as might be
after the ticket window was opened
at 11 o'clock this morning, and that
tho game would be witnessed by a
crowd that would fill the park to its
2i).O0O capacity.
This interest was evident despite
the fact that Manager Wilbert Robin
son's team had so far failed to win a
game in the series. The two defeats
in Boston were suffered by such close'
scores and. particularly in yesterday's
game, accompanied by the exhibition
of such high-class baseball and evi
dences of gamcness by the Superbas
that Brooklyn fans still clung strong
ly to hopes of ultimate victory.
The rival teams readied New York
on a late evening train from Boston,
the Red Sox going to an uptown hotel
in Manhattan for the night. The
members of t lie Brooklyn squad took
automobiles for Fhitbush to spend the
night in their homes there.
