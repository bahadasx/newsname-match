NO TROUBLE
EXPECTED,
Germany's New Activity Does:
Not Portend Complications
Submarine Warfare at Very
Door of United States.
HIGH OFFICIALS EXPRESS VIEWS,'
Diplomatic Clash With Germany Not
Likely So Long ss Submarine Oper
ations Are Carried On Within Llm
Itatlons of International Law Quec
tlon of .Neutrality Rights, However.
May Be Raised by Uncle Sam.
"Washington. Oct 9. High offlclala.
here state that submarine -warfare at
the very iloors of the United States
does not necessarily portend further
complications with Germany, so long:
as It is carried on within the limlta
tlons of international law. None of the
shlps destroyed yesterday appear to
have been attacked without warning
or without proper measures having
been taken for safety of those aboard
Academically at least. In Interns
tlonal law an allied ship destroyed by
a German submarine just outside the
three mile limit and In sight of Amer
ican shores is no different than a ship
dostrojed In the Arctic ocean, provid
ed Us destruction Is accomplished in
accordance with tho laws of the na
tions and humanity
But, despite the fact that It seems
to make little difference on which pa5
ticiilar part or the high seas German-r
prosecutes her newest submarine tain
paign, officials and diplomats see s.
situation filled with so many possible
ities that it is almost lmpossibiu' to
enumerate them, ho Ion? as commerce
in and out of American ports Is men
aced. '
The presence of a German subma
rine flotilla near American territorjej
waters, officials fear, maj raise- pei
plexlng questions of neutrality, and:
In fact, a most serious- issue would toe
raised If the operations of the sub
mersibles were carried on so neaf.
American ports as practically to con
ttitute a blockade.
At the outset of the war, when al
lied cruisers hovered off Xew Yorlc so
close that commerce was Impeded", tft
United States, construing their o-pen-tlons
as practically a blockade, notT
fled France and Great Britain or fte
objections, and the ships promntijr
were moed further out to sea. TA
posslbilit of a similar situation resnTi-
. lng from submarine operations Is. fore-
Accompanied by Submersibles-.
Half a dozen ships destroyed prac
tically ulthln sight of tho shores of
the United States wjile American
warships hovered near to take off Ore
victims aroused reports of German
bases and convoys. One renewed tc
Tort was that large quantities of fcvl
oil had been submerged at po!nt3 in
the Gulf of Mexico, on the coast af
Maine and on tJie Canadian coaHtt
I A conjecture which was generaH.4
accepted as ninon? the most likely-
possibilities v,as that the submarine
or submarines are accompanied 6j"
merchant submerslbles of the Deutscti
land and Bremen typ&, loaded wil
torpedoes and ammunition.
Many ntnria's leaned to that xlnvr
and pointed out that one lone sub
marine 3,000 miles from a base would
scarcely have spent torpedoes- so
j prodigally as did Commander Ross f
ine u-a.i. unless mere was a supply
closely at hand.
It was openly declared here that
the operations mark the opening of ai
organized campaign in tho waters ad
jacent to A-nr "ca against all com
merce of the al 's In general, and es
roclally vess"lf 'arrylng munitions oif'
war. It is CNpt.ted that attacks also
will be directed at transports carrying:
troops from Canada and at British nnd
French warships In patrol duty off the
coast.
Diplomatic representatives of th
central powers declared emphatically
that they ltnew the assurances regard
ing the conduct of subranrlno warfare
given to the United States would ba
strictly adhered to and that no ves
sels would be sunk without warning
or before the passengers and crows
had heon given opportunity to reach
a place of safety.
