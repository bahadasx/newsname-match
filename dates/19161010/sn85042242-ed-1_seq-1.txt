GOVERNOR HANNA IS
FOR ENTIRE TICKET
Republican Presidential Candi­
date Hailed as Man for
Crisis
Bismarck's first political rally stag­
ed by women only will go down in
history as a complete success a suc­
cess which crowded the Auditorium's
1,100 seats and which Ailed every
inch of standing room with an atten­
tive, interested audience.
The meeting conducted by the
members of the women's Hughes spe­
cial train party was satisfactory from
every standpoint—satisfactory in the
expressions of rock-bound Republican­
ism, which it brought from Gov. L. B.
Hanna in his introductory remarks,
and from all, of the speakers who fol­
lowed him, and satisfactory in the en­
thusiastic recaption which all the re­
marks met. v"
Opening by ChairmAf
At 8:40 the members of tl|e Wom­
en's party marched onto the sta^e, to
the strains of "America," wittr the
feudience standing. They war* follow
ed by W. J. Prater, chairman of th»
Republican county central commit­
tee, and Governor L. B. Hanna. The
county chairman neatly introduced
the governor, as chairman for the
evening,Utnd North Dakota's chief ex­
ecutive lose .to the inspiration of the
occasion^,,) J. -i'
Hanna For McCumber.
After expressing the appreciation
of the state and tne city for the hon­
or paid them in the visit of these
noted women, the governor renewed
his declaration of faith in the follow­
ing words: "The results last June
were not just what I would have liked
them to be, but I have found that,
every man who went into the Chicago
convention a candidate has come out
unreservedly for Charles Evans
Hughes, and in a lesser way I intend
to stand without reservation for the
national, state, .senatorial, congres­
sional, county and local candidates on
the Republican ticket, and I trust that
my friends will do so. I have always
oeen a Republican, because I believe
in Republican principles. I believe in
protection, and I believe we' need it
just as badly here in North Dakota
as elsewhere in America."
Mary Antin's Address.
Mary Antin, introduced by Gover­
nor Hanna as a Russian immigrant
girl who has become one of the great­
est women in America, author of
"Those Who Knock at Our Door,"
"The Promised Land," and other so­
ciological masterpieces dealing with
the assimilation of the immigrant,
told the.«tort of the women's Hughes
train, froll ttt inception to tbe pres­
ent. She had known/ she said, that
the coming election was to be one of
the most important of many decades
she knew that a crisis was impend­
ing, that a turning point in the ca­
reer of the United States had been
reached, but she had been interested
in her sociological works she had
many speaking engagements, and
when the call came to her she hesi­
tated to accept. But she did accept,
and she had been glad of it every
moment of the time since. All
through the sizzling hot summer
months the originators of this move­
ment conceived by women, financed
by women and carried out by women
had worked. The inspiration of the
train had come only a few weeks ago.
"When I was asked to join, I sim­
ply had to do it. I had been preach­
ing Americanism, and working for
Hughes gave me a short-cut to the
goal which I sought. He gave us our
first state legislation for the immi­
grant. and when he goes to the White
House he will give us our first real
federal legislation. I am making this
tour at a personal sacrifice—every
woman here has come at a personal
sacrifice. We are all working women.
Wlhen the call came, I simply told
my managers that I had been drafted
into the service of my country, and I
,came.
The Billionaire Special.
"We are doing more than we had
ever expected to do, judging from the

The vastness of the state of North

one of the biggest demonstrations

On all sides could be heard expres­

Republican Party's Program la
Outlined by Nominee at
Philadelphia
AGAIN REFERS TO
LUBITANIA DISASTER
Will Not Tolerate Any Improper
Interference With American
Rights
Philadelphia, Pa., Oct. 9.—Charles
E. Hughes, in a speech at the Metro­
politan opera house here tonight, vig­
orously assailed the president and
the administration for its Mexican
policy and outlined the Republican
party's program in two respects as
follows:
"We do not propose to tolerate any
improper interference with American
property, or with American mails, or
legitimate commercial intercourse.
"Xo American who is exercising on­
ly American rights shall be put on a
blacklist by any foreign nation."
In reference to the seizure of Am­
erican mails and the British blacklist
of American firms, Mr. Hughes recall­
ed the sinking of the Lusitania, re­
peating the declaration contained in
his speech of acceptance and that
had the American government left no
doubt that '"when we said 'strict ac­
countability' we meant precisely what
we' said," there would have been no
destruction of American lives by the
sinking of the Lusitania.

Executives Will Discuss German
Submarine Raids in U. S.

POSITION OF AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT MADE CLEAR
President Will See :French Am­
bassador and Discuss Situa­
tion With Him
Long Branch, N. J,' Oct. 9.—Secre­
tary Lansing, it Was announced to­
night, will come here tomorrow for a
conference with President Wilson
concerning German submarine raids
off the American coast. Mr. Lansing
is expected to remain over night at
the president's summer residence.
The announcement that the secre­
tary of state would aonfer with the
president confirmed the impression
gained here earlier in the day that
the American government considered
tbe attacks on vessels off the coast
by a German submarine as frought
with grave pb|»rfbllities, at tbe same
time It' .wa^.p£fe clear that there is
nothing inrefltfrts so far received to
show that-international law or the
earlier /promiser «f Germany have
ben violated. Concern over the situ­
ation centered chiefly (about the pos­
sibility of What mlghtv happen if the
submarine attacks are?continued.
Position MadejClear.
The position of theVUnerican gov­
ernment. and Its, djftfflanipation to
make a^full investlgiinort before^ act­
ing has been made clear by the presi­
dent.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, who cainie here today to
give the president a personal letter
from the German emperor, on Polish
relief, discussed with President Wil­
son the new activities of German sub­
marines. It was understood thai the
president made it clear that while
the American government had no in­
tentions of interfering with the legiti­
mate use of submarines, it would in­
sist on the strict observation of the
pledges given previously by the Ger­
man government.
Official Advises Lacking.
The ambassador, while lacking offi­
cial advices from his government of
the submarine attacks, said the Ger­
man government had promised to
conduct the submarine warfare in ac­
cordance with the cruiser rules of
warfare.
Before seeing Secretary Lansing,
the president will confer with Jewels
Juesserand, the French ambassador,
wflo is coming to Shadow Lawn, to
bring a personal letter from Presi­
dent Poincaire of France to President
Wilson on Polish relief.
It is considered probable that dur­
ing the conference the 'French am­
bassador may lay before the presi­
dent the view of the Entente govern­
ments that German submarines
should not be allowed to come into
American ports.

London, Oct. 9.—On the battle
fronts in Europe Transylvania and
Macedonia continue for the moment
the centers of greatest interest. Ac­
cording to Berlin, the Roumanians in
Transylvania are retreating along
the whole line. The Teutonic allies
have recaptured the town of Toerz
burg, within seven miles of the Rou­
manian border. In the Danube, north
of Sistova, the Germans have occu­

making prisoners of the Roumanian
troops there.
Serbs Cross Cerna River.
Serbians, in considerable force,
have crossed the Cerna river, in Ser­

have occupied positions along the
north bank of the river.
Hard Fighting Near Lutsk.
Considerable hard fighting has
again taken place in the region west
of Lutsk and farther south in Galicia,
but the results are osmewhat be­
clouded by reason of the contradic­

Near Brzezany, in Galicia, both
Petrograd and Berlin record Repulses
of attacks. In the Carpathians the
Germans have advanced at Babalu

UD ML) KILLED
Hebron, N. D., Oct. 9.—Paul, the
4_year-old son of George Urban of He­
bron, was instantly killed Sunday af­
ternoon, when he fell from the auto­
mobile in which he was riding with
his father, and was crushed to death
by the rear wheels of the machine.
The body of the little lad was brought
to Hebron immediately. Funeral ser­
vices will be held this afternoon.
It is supposed that the youngster
was leaning against the door of the
car and it accidentally opened, pre­
cipitating him from the moving ve­
hicle. In falling he undoubtedly
grasped the running board and was
thrown beneath the rear wheels. His
chest was badly crushed and all ef­
forts to save his life were unavail­

S
Newport, R. I., Oca. 9.—The whole­
sale raid on foreign shipping south
of Nantucket lightship Sunday was
the work of one submarine, according
to reports of American naval officers.
Rear Admiral Albert GleaveB, com­
manding the torpedo boat destroyer
flotilla, which did such remarkable
speedy rescue work yesterday, said
tonight that the reports of all his
officers agreed that to the best of
their observation, one raider only was
concerned. This boat, presumably,
was the German U-53, which called at
Newport Saturday afternoon to mail
a letter to Ambassador Bernstorff
an dthen put to sea without taking on
an ounce of supplies, although
she was seventeen days from her
base, according to the statement of
her officers.
This opinion would seem to be
naval officers indicates that but one
submarine was operating.
Statement Borne Out.
This opnion would seem to be
borne out by the statements of many
of the refugees, that the submarine
had more business on hand than she
could care of at once, and was oblig­
ed to request one steamer to wait her
turn while another was being put out
of commission.
Raiding Has Ceased.
Today, the raiding had ceased, at
least for the moment.
The unknown list of the victims of
the II boat's Sunday exploits re­
mains at six, notwithstanding reports
from the Nantucket lightship that
three other ships, the identity of
which could not be learned, were sent
to the bottom.
Ten Refugees Landed.
Ten more refugees were landed
here tonight by the Maville, tender of
th destroyer flotilla, which picked up
ten Chinese members of the crew of
the Strathdene.
Destroyers swept the waters on a
wide area today in a vain search for
the crew of the steamer Kingstonia,
who were seen by members of tha
Strathdene to take to their boats be­
fore their vessel was sunk.
Notwithstanding the lull in such
marine activities today, shipping men
were by no means reassured.
DEPUTY U. S. MARSHAL HERE.
Deputy U. S. Marshal Gammons of
Fargo was here yesterday on official
business.

BRITISH COMMERCE
Believed German U-53 Is Only One of Flotilla of Submersible^
that Directed Attacks on Vessels of Allied Nations.
SHIPPING ALONG NEW
ENGLAND COAST STOPS
Boston, Oct. 9.—German submarine warfare brought to this side
of the Atlantic Sunday night pursued relentlessly throughout, the
night. With the dawn came reports of more vessels torpedoed and
sunk.
The captain of the Nantucket lightship off which the attacks on
passenger and freight ships were made, reported three Oemum
submei'sihles were oprating south and southeast of Nantucket and
that a total of nine vessels had been destroyed.
The identity of three of this number was unknown, but ship9
from the American destroyer flotilla at Newport were searching the
seas for the crews that were supposed to have taken to their small
boats.
Eushing to give battle to the submarines, three British cruisers
were off Nantucket shoals at 2:40 o'clock this morning. This wa9
the first appearance of any warships of the British and French pa­
trolling fleet in that vicinity since the submersibles began their at­
tacks at (i o'clock yesterday morn ing.
The passengers and crew of the Red Cross steamer Stephano and
the crews of the British freighters Strathdens and Westpoint and
the Dutch freight steamer Chr. Knudsen, destroyed yesterday,
were landed at Newport, R. I. today.
The crew of the British freighter Kingston was missing th's
morning, but the men were reported to be in life boats thirty miles
southeast, of Nantucket.
American Officers Firmly Believe
One Sub-8ea Boat Did the
Work
INDICATIONS POINT
TO GERMAN U-53
Not Identified.
Early today the submarine or, sub­
marines had not been identified, but
there is doubt in the minds of'naval
officers that one of the engines of
destruction was the German U-53,
Which delivered mall for the derritaa
ambassador, Count Bernstorff at New­
port yesterday. The belief is grow­
ing that the U-53 is only one of a He*
tllla of German submarines gathered'
for attacks on vessels of the allied
nations and neutral bottoms carrying
contraband of war. Their operation*
so far as known have been known
south and southeast of Nantucket Isl­
and and from three to ten miles off
shore.
The submarine arm of the Imperial
German navy began ravaging ship*
ping off the eastern coast of the Unit*
ed States Sunday.
Four British, one Dutch and one
Norwegian steamers were sent 'to the
bottom or left crippled derelicts off
Nantucket Shoals.
Last night under the light of the
Hunter's moon, the destroyer flotilla
of the United States Atlantic fleet
was kept busy picking up passengers
and crews of the destroyed vessels
and bringing them into Newport, R. I.
So far as known, there was no loss
of life.
A submarine held up the American
steamer, Kansan, bound from New
York for Genoa, with steel for the
Italian government, but later on es­
tablishing her identity, allowed tha
American to proceed. The Kansan
came into Boston harbor late last
night for her usual call here.
The hostile submarine is believed
to be the U-53, which paid a call to
Newport yesterday and disappeared
at sunset. Some naval men, how­
ever, declared that at least two tab.
marines are operating close to tbe
American shore though outside the
three-mllo limit.
Holds Up Shipping.
Shipping at ports along the New
England coast had been held np to a
greater extent today and vessels at
sea were reported making for the
nearest harbor. The sudden onslaught
of underseas craft had thoroughly ter­
rified shipping interests engaged in
the carrying of munitions of war and
other shipping not flying the Amerl
can flag.
The American steamer, Kansan.
which was held up by a submarine
off Nantucket, at 4:30 o'clock yester­
day morning, arrived here today.' Her
captain said he had turned back in
response to the signals of distress
from the West Point, but Hading that
his assistance was not required ho
proceeded to Boston.
The richest prize bagged by tha
Germans yet was the passenger liner,
Stephano, which had just rounded the
east end of Nantucket when she fell
prey to a submarine. The vessel,
British owned, was on her regular
trip from St. John's, N. F„ to New
York, via Halifax, and carried 83 pas­
sengers, including 30 Americana.
Twenty-isix of the latter were making
the round trip on the steamer from
New York. The Stephano was" val­
ued at $400,000 when she was launch­
ed, three years ago. She carried also
a cargo of codfish, codfish oil' and
seal oil, consigned to parties la tfcs
United States and South America and
valued at $150,000. Her naval valM
was due to the fact that she had bees
sold to the Russian government
