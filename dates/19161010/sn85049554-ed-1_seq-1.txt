German submarine raider. First word
reached the Espagne Sunday by wire

Brooklyn I®
New Tork, Oct. 10,—With the battle
for the premier baseball honor of the
year transferred from Boston to Brook
lyn today the baseball enthusiasts of
Greater New Tork flocked by the thous
ands to EJbbets' field to view the world's
series from a new angle. The tide of
travel turned toward Flatbush, where
sits the stadium occupied by the pres
ent National League champions.
In contrast with the warm haziness
of the past few days, the morning broke
cool and' breezy, with a promise of a
day more suited to work on the gridiron
than the diamond:
Long before game time there was
every indication that the stadium, at
the call of play, would be ailed to the
limit of its 26,000 capacity,
On familiar ground, after the loss
of the two heart-breaking struggles on
alien soil, the Dodgers figured in the
calculations of the ardent Brooklynites
as likely to gather the inspiration to
give them the edge they lacked in the
past performances. Nevertheless, It
was realised that today's battle might
virtually decide the series.
Boston Hopes For Four Straight.
On the other hand. t^jRed StaK root

fident in the superiority of\the Boston
biachlne, supremely reliant that "elites'-'
would telL
One game, a most, for the Robins,
was all that tho great majority of them
would concede, and with their starter
likely to be Leonard', another left hand
er, who, when In shape, is one of the
hardest twlrlers to hit, few of them
could see anything but a third victory,
with another to follow with Shore or
Mays tomorrow.
The lineup today was:
oj*
Brooklyn—Stengel, right field Dap
bert, first base Myers, center field
Wheat, left field Cutshaw, second
base Mowrey, third base Olson, short
stop Miller, catcher Coombs, pitcher.
Boston—(Hooper, right field Janvrln,
second base Walker, center field Hob
lltzel, first base Lewis, left field Gard
ner, third base Scott, shortstop
Thomas, catcher Mays, pitcher.
Ebbets' Field, Brooklyn, Oct. 10.—To
turn the tide that has been carrying
them away from the world's title, the
Brooklyn Nationals made a back-to
the-wall fight today in the first contest
on the home field. A defeat for Brook
lyn today would leave their champion
ship hopes hanging by a hair. As it
now stands Brooklyn must win four
out of the remaining five contests,
while the Red Sox need but two more
victories to place them on the cham
pionship pinnace.
"We have our work cut out for us,"
remarked Jack Coombs, the Brooklyn
pitcher. "Our work will improve on
the home ground where we have
played out best ball. I hope Rdbinson
uses me today."
Manager Carrigan, of Boston, whose
strategy brought victory In the game
yesterday, was a sphinx on his pitching
selection today. It was recalled that
"Dutch" Leonard showed remarkable
form In his spring games when the
weather was cold, and it was^ believed
he would go to the mound today.
Brooklyn saw its first world's series
game today. Heretofore it has had to
cross the bridge and watch the New
Tork Giants perform In the all-impor
£ant series. Keen for the taste of the
big baseball events that make^ or un
makes a champl6n, hundreds came
early to the park and sat for hours in
the chilling wind. Scores of secytafors
wrapped themselves In sweaters and
newspapers to keep out the biting
edges of the north wind. The sun
shone clear and bright but it waa a
poor day for a ball game. The players
themselves hugged the warm rooms of
the club house until the last moment.
The temporary bleachers erected be
hind left and center field were the first
to fill up, While the box holders, se
cured In their seats, waited until lpte
before coming to the park. Apparently
ground rules on overthrows and hits
Into the temporary outfield stands
would be made.
The band tried to keep warm and In
tune down near the home bench.
Batting Practice Interests.
Brooklyn took their batting practice
first. Manager Robinson sent out
"Duster" Mays, a left bander, and Ap
pleton, to serve up the batters. Some
of the long drives brought cheers from
the early crowd. During Boston's bat
ting practice Pennlck worked on the
mound. The Boston batters tried out
the ranges of all fields, add then took a
PWiJ wW:9ii mm*
few shots at the right field wall, which
is a favorite target of Brooklyn's heavy
artillery. The first excitement came
whan the Boston Royal Boosters, 500
strong, led by a band in red coats, pa
raded around the field. "Tet'sle," the
battle song of the fans, was the tune to
which they marchcd.
There was plenty of snap, in the
fielding practice, notwithstanding the
cold. Both Daubert and Merkle worked
out at first base, and It looked as tho
Robinson intended to use Merkle if"
Leonard was sent in to pitch for Bos
ton.
Mays Pitches For Boston.
While Boston was batting Carl Mays
and 'Dutch" Leonard warmed up, while
the old Athletic star, Jack Coombs,
warmed up for the Dodgers.
The batteries Were announced as fol
lows: Mays artd Thomas for Boston,
Coombs and Miller for Brooklyn. It
was announced that O'Day would um
pire behind the plate, while Connolly
would make the bafe* decisions, with
Dlneen in right and Quigley in left
field.
There was a long conference of um
pires and managers on ground rules
and this delayed the opening of the
game.

U. S. REJECTS
"SUB" CLAIMS
Contention of Allies That
Use of Harbors Be De
nied is Refused.
UNDERSEA VESSELS
HAVE RIGHT TO COME
Contention That Submarines Are Out
laws Not Accepted by State Depart
ment at Washington—Text of British
Not* Made Public Upon Receipt of
American Answer Doolining to Up
hold Position of Entente Alliea,
Washington, Oct 10.—The United
States has refused to accept the con
tention of the entente allies urging
that neutrals deny the use of their
harbors to all submarines, whether
merchantmen or warships, Counsellor
Polk of the state department announc
ed today.
The allied governments in a memor
andum to neutral powers called atten
tion *to the "grave danger Incurred by
neutral vessels in regions frequented
by belligerent submarines". Consular
Polk announced the department's po
sition. It will not be mafe public be
fore the return of Secretary Lansing
from the summer White House.
The claim of the allies that subma
rines are outlaws, as the note cabled
last night from London shows, brought
!»n the* question of whether the Amer
ican government may be sued for dam
ages resulting from the call of the
German submarine U-53, at Newport
before she started on her raid against
commerce.
Under the interpretation of the al
lies the position may be taken that
.Newport was made the base for oper
ations which officials estimate already
have caused at least 6,000,000 damage
to allied shipping and trade.
Any attempt to collect damage, how
ever, probably would be most vigor
ously opposed by this government,
which holds that a warship has a
right to enter a neutral harbor, and
that the U-63 in no way attempted to
make Newport a base.
British Note Made Publio.
London, Oct. 10.—The text of the
memorandum recently sent by the en
tente allies to neutral governments re
specting the admission of belligerent
submarines into neutral waters or
Wrey Twrts'ts as .follows:
•V'Uny^wot.thp.development^fqufer,
marine -asDvlgation *UH"d TSy reason of
acts, which In the present'"circum
stances may be unfortunately expected
from enemy submarined, the allied
governments consider it necessary, In
order not only to safeguard their bel
ligerent rights and liberty of commer
cial navigation, but to avoid risks of
dispute, to urge neutral governments
to take.effectlve measures, If they have
not already done so, with a view to
preventing belligerent submarine ves
sels, whatever tho purpose to which
they are put, from making use of neu
tral waters, roadsteads and ports.
Tell ^Special Conditions.
"In *-ae case of submarine vessels the
application of the principles' of the
laws of nations is affected by special
and novel conditions—'first, by the fact
that these vessels can navigate and
reimain at sea submerged and can thus
escape all control and observation
second, by the fact that It is impossi
ble to Identify them and establish
their national character, whether neu
tral or belligerent, combatant or non
combatants, and to remove the capaci
ty for harm Inherent In the nature of
such vessels.
"It may further he said that any
place which provides a submarine war
ship far from its base with an oppor
tunity for rest and replenishment of Its
supplies thereby furnishes such addi
tion to its powers that the place be
comes in fact, thru the advantages
which it gives, a base of naval opera
tions.
"In view of the state of affairs thus
existing, the allied governments are of
the opinion that submarine vessels
should be excluded from the benefit of
the rules hitherto recognized by the
laws of nations regarding the admis
sion of vessels of war, or merchant
vessels into neutral waters, roadsteads
or ports, and their sojourn in them.
Any belligerent submarine entering a
neutral port should be detained there.
The allied governments take this op
portunity to point out to the neutral
powers the grave danger incurred by
neutral submarines In the navigation
of regions frequented by belligerent
submarines."
WILSON AWAITS DEVELOPMENTS.
No Action to Be Taken Immediately on
Recant Raids.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 10.—Presi
dent Wilson, gave his entire attention
today to considering facts collected by
the navy department regarding German
submarine attacks'lm merchantmen on
the Atlantic coast. He Intended to go
to Brooklyn for the world's series but
chahged bis plans.
Tho president, tlfls morning went
carefully over the evidence collected so
far. While this evidence was not given
out there was every Indication that the
president has received no Information
necessitating drastic action.
The president today was to confer
with Secretary Lansing and Jules Jus
serand, French ambassador to the
United States.
It was not believed that the American
government would take any Immediate
action on developments to date, but se
rious consideration was given to the
question as to whether attacks on mer
chantmen so close to the American
coast do not .virtually constitute a
blockade of American porta.
