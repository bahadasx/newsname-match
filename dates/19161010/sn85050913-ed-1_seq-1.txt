DIAMOND THEVES VISIT
Attempt to Substitute Rings With
Glass Settings for Diamond
Rings.
Evidently what was a small band
of diamond thieves was operating in
this city Friday, as attempts were
made at four jewelry stores to sub
stitute rings with Cheap glass set
tings for diamond rings.
'j The first known attempt was at
the Teed & Teed jewelry store in the
It .. afternoon, when a couple entered
and asked to see loose diamonds. Mr.
Teed was suspicious of them and re
fused to show the loose stones. He
did, however, show them the mount
ed diamonds but watched them very
closely and they soon left the store.
About 5:30 o'clock they entered
the Downard jewelry store. The pro
prietor had gone to supper and J. L.
Fentzer, the optician, wa3 on duty
They asked here- for rings for a
twelve year old girl, asking to see
small diamonds. The rings were all
tagged in the trays shown and no
attempt was made to substitute a
cheaper ring. The loose stones were
locked in the safe and these were the
ones they particularly wished to see,
so left the store only to return in a
few minutes and ask again for the
proprietor, who had not yet return
ed, that they might see the loose dia
monds.
At twenty mlnuteB of six the same
couple, according to description, en
tered the Oleson jewelry store and
asked to see small rings. Gradually
leading up to the subject of dia
monds, they requested the proprie
tor to get out his diamonds which
were mounted. The couple were a
womanwith auburn hair, rather ov
er medium weight, age probably
about twenty-two, accompanied by a
youth of about eighteen or nineteen
After looking at the mounted
rings for a time the young man held
one up to the light and in a few mo
ments apparently put it back in the
tray. Mr. Oleson, as is the habit of
jewelers, looked at once at the re
turned ring to see if it was the same
one and quickly detected the cheap
stone. "Drop that ring!" he shout
ed at the young man, who "dropped
it" hurriedly, with an "all right!"
The couple then edged toward the
door while Mr. Oleson made a hur
ried inventory of his tray. When his
survey was satisfactory he looked for
the couple, but they had vanished.
He, with a customer who was in
the store at the time, made the
rounds of the stores then, looking
for the couple, but found none an
swering their description. Their
"pals," however, were almost at that
minute busy with the same game of
"penny-weighting" in the J. M.
Richardson jewelry store of which
the proprietor had gone to supper.
The jeweler, Mr. Winslow, was in
the store and the couple which en
tered there does not answer the de
scription of the one in the other
stores.
This couple was a woman of prob
ably twenty-seven years, very chem
ically blonde as to hair, and she was
the spokesman. Her companion was
a youth of about eighteen, nervous,
and giving the appearance of a dope
fiend. Shortly after they began look
ing rings over, Mr. Winslow became
suspicious of them and in a few mo
ments, while putting away a tray of
rings, got the flash of a fake ring
secreted in the young man's hand,
just below the edge of the count
er glass.
At once he told them he was about
to lock up the rings and unless they
saw one they wished to buy, closing
time had come. They promised to
come in in the morning and left the
store.
A sequel to the story is one told
by Dr. F. A. Boysen whose office was
entered by a young man of the type
above mentioned, late in the after
noon. The stranger was nervous and
had evfery appearance of a dope
fiend. He asked for a "shot" of mor
phine, claiming he was Gnroute to
K^ngng city and must have enough
to get him there. He was referred
to a physician and left the office
without procuring his morphine.
There were evidently four in the
party which was observed several
times during the day, and a concert
ed effort made to smuggle diamonds
otft of the stores entered. Not in

this association is arranging a Find
Five Club, each member of which
will sign this pledge:
I agree to sell five tickets, at ten
cents each, for the Charity Style
Show. "v

To the Voters of Hamilton County.
Eds. Freeman-Tribune: If you will
remember four years ago, at the
June primary, there were six candi
dates ran for sheriff on tho republi
can ticket with the following result:
Candidate Votes
W. H. Cunningham 591
H. I. Thompson 1 402
J. W. Johnson 167
W. J. Monroe 309
B. F. Nickerson 727
Rufus Nelson 791
At that time Mr. Nelson received
a few more votes than I did, al
though I carried ten voting precincts
out of twenty-one precincts in the
county over all the candidates. At
that time Mr. Nelson told me and a
great many others that he would
not be a candidate at the end of
four years and I said I would be a
candidate at the end of his two
terms. Some time before the June,
1916, primary. Deputy Sheriff Carl
came to me and said that he was a
candidate and also that Mr. Nelson
was coming out for the third term.
I decided that Mr. Carl was more
entitled to the office than was Mr.
Nelson for a third term. I therefore
concluded to stay out of the primary,
not split the vote, and give Mr. Carl
a chance.
I hope this will make it plain to
all why I solicit your votes now.

patch yesterday stating that her
father. Samuel G. Clark, an old time
resident of this city and vicinity,
had passed away at ah early hour
yesterday at a hospital in Ox
ford, Kansas. He was afflicted with
cancer of the face and his death was
not unexpected.
Mr. Clark was a respected citizen
of this community in the early dayB

the older residents. He removed
from this vicinity to Kansas about
nine years ago, returning at inter
vals to visit his daughter and fam
ily. Since leaving Hamilton coun
ty he has made his.home at Oxford.

Final Golf Tournament on the Out­
ing Club Links—Players
are Paired.
The official golfing season at the
Outing Club for 1916, will be wound
up this week with a dinner
match, for which sides, headed by
R. W. Pote and R. S. Phillips, have
been chosen, the losing side in the
contest to pay for the banquet,
which will be served to the partici
pating players at the Club hou?e,
Thursday, Oct. 12th, at 6:30 p. m.
The players have been matched
according to their handicaps and
will therefore compete on even
terms, and the rivalry will be keen.
The pairings are as follows
Pote versus Phillips.
Wilson verses Bair.
J. M. Richardson verses Hughes.
Currie versus Crosley.
Jones versus Mason.
Miller versus Metcalf.
Boeye versus Henderson.
Pyle versus G. M. Teed.
Prince versus E. E. Richardson.
O'Connor versus Lehnhard.
Younkee versus Dysart.
Drake versus Parkhurst.
Banks versus Garth.
Clifton versus Sterling.
G. W. Teed versus Pearce.
Jenkinson versus Bermann.
King versus Brown.
Match play rules will govern the
contest, and 18 holes will constitute
a match. The points will be—
1 point for winning the first nine
holes.
1 point for winning the second
nine holes.
1 point for winning the match.
1 point in case of default by op
ponent.
The individual matohes may be
played any time before Thursday
night, and all cards must l^e deposit
ed in the regular tournament box
before 6 p. m. on the night of the
banquet.
The box will be opened, the points
counted and the losing side announc
ed during the progress of the ban
quet, so that all may really enjoy
the eats, secure for the time at
least, in the thought that the other
fellow has to pay for the feed.
In case the contest results in a
tie, the side of the losing captain
pays, and in such a consequence,
said captain will probably leave
town the following day—until after
it has blown over.
All platers are urged to take
early advantage of the prevailing
fine weather and complete their
matches as soon as possible.

The stabbing affray occurred
about 7 o'clock in the evening when
a good sized party of congenial
friends were gathered about the
foaming contents of an eight gallon
keg of beer. Both men were intoxi
cated and Bell claims that Butler
tried to take a one dollar bill away
from him. Bell denies using a knife,
but a knife was unmistakably used
upon Butler's body.
Sheriff Nelson and his deputy took
Bell into custody Sunday morning
but upon the furnishing of a $300
caBh bond, he was given his liberty
and the case set for next morning in
JuBtice Tucker's court.
The defendant, however, waived
preliminary proceedings and was
bound over to the grand jufry.
