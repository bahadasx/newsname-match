Giarley Laquire, a chaingang guard,
last night killed three men, including
himself, and with two shots probably
f fatally wounded a fourth. The trage'
<dv occurred at the county farm about
four miles east of town. j
The dead are: JDlton Townsend,
manager of the county farm and
alms house, Pamp Davis, his father-1
in-law, and Chiarley Luquire, the
guard who killed tliese two men and
then killed himself. Tom iMcCombs,1

% brother of Supervisor J. B. McCombs,
was shot twice through the right lung
and although still alive this evening,
Jris condition is regarded as mighty
precarious and his chances of recovery
are very sligfat.
I
Charley Inquire, the guard who J
ran amuck, came to town yesterday!
^ to attend the circus. He was told by '
iMcCombs to be ;back at the farm
5 o'clock. Luquire 'began drinK**_,
wihen he reached town and was In an
ugly imood all the afternon. He
started a row in a pool room and
4 once or twi^e pulled out his pistol
and threatened to "shoot <up" somebody.
.
He did not leave town until late,
reaching the farm a little after 7
o'clock. Tom McCombs was sitting in
a buggy in front of the residence occupied
by Manager Townsend. He
was expecting to come to town him
self and was waiting for Luquire to
| return. He says re remarked to Lui
quire that he was late and was about
i to keep the others from going to
f the night performance of the show.
Without a word in reply but with
an oath Luquire pulled his pistol and
fired twice at MoCombs, both shots
taking effect in the right lung. As
McCombs crumpled up on the buggy
seat, Mr. Davis, who lives with
Townsend, his son-in-law, and who
(
? noar remarked. "Why
'V> <XO OUVuuiu,^ mvm> , ?
Charley, you have killed Mr. Tom."
Without a word Luquire fired at
(him, one shot piercing him in the
(abdomen. Just as he fell, Townsend,
Who was eating supper, rushed
out of the ihuose and started down
the front path, calling out to know
what was the matter. Luquire fired
once at Sum 30 yards away* He too
fell with a wound through his body.
T-nnuire then walked in the house j
where Mrs. Townsend and children
were, went into the room he occupied,
remained about a minute and
walked back down the front path.
y McCombs saw him returning and i3
said to have said to him. "Well, j
Charley, you have killed tnree or us.'
Answering that was what he started
ou tc do, Luquire placed the pistol
against his own temple and fired and
with that fifth bullet ended his own
life.
t
Townsend, Davis and iMcCombs
were rushed to the Greenwood hospital.
Davis and Townsend lived
only two hours. McCombs is still
living but his chances are very slight.
McCombs is a brother of supervisor
Jim McCombs. He has a wife
tand two small children. Townsend
leaves a wife and three small children.
His father-in-law, Mr. Davis,
s been living with him for the past
few years. His wife is dead.
Ivuquire, who did the shooting,
leaves a wife and two children. All
are natives Of this county. Luquire
was reared at Callison. Townsend
/ |
and Davis are from the Cokeshury!
section of the county and McCombs!
I
has lived near town most or ins me.
It is believed that Luquire had a1
grudge against McCombs, fearing that
re was about to lose his job. It was I

Do it for Newberry.
Do what? Yo>u naturally ask.
Always and ever anything tb.it will j
make Newberry a bigger, better, more i
beautiful town to live in.
But right now, on the twentieth
I nf the month, do a man's part or a
woman's part to make the first entertainment
given this year by the Newfccrrv
schools a real success. The j
details of this entertainment will be j
published later.
The public schools of a city are one ;
thing that belongs to everybody. Stores j
I belong to merchants, homes to indi1
viduals, but the schools to everybody.
Twenty years from today the working
citizens of Newberry will be com-'
nospd r.hieflv of the girls and boys j
now being trained in the public
schools of iXewberry. Whether the>
will be working for a good town or
a poor one will depend on the train-!
:
ing the citizens of Newberry give j
them now.
Realizing that parents should know I
wihat the schools tare trying to do, j
ihow they are hampered, and what their j
needs are, the teachers and parents j
ihave formed associations.
At present there is a flourishing
Parent-Te^ciier's association at Boun-!
dary Street School. Both schools have j
god, well equipped buildings, but at1
each school some things are needed.;
Boundary Street school has an audi- j
torium, but it is not furnished with ;
seats. This means that the school
cannot assemble as a wttole. The:
- - - - i. A ? A ^ '
school ought to oe a unit, ougui UJ UU I
things together. Assembling the chil-!
dren in one room for opening exer- j
cises would help them catch the spir-j
it of working together for the good of'
the "whole. They will he better citi- j
zens in the future if they learn this j
lesson in school days.
The two associations will divide
the proceeds of the entertainment, and j
i
each will apply its share to what it
need most now\

On his graduation from tre Citadel,

Last year the State of Indiana appointed
October 7th as "Riley Day" in
tat tate. On Thursday morning at
the high school Dr. Kinard told the
story of Riley's life, and read severa.
selections from is work. On Friday
the children of the Speers street school
devoted one period to Riley. Severa!
interesting papers were read, and
I three or four of the children gave re-1
citations. Mrs. R. D. Wright read the
famous "Bear" story. Another pleasing
feature of the entertainment was
the recitation in concert of "Little
Orphant Annie" toy several members
of the sixth grade.
Some of the grades are very full;
greatest tragedy in its history for

The 'Wfoman's Missionary union 01 j
the Second presbytery of the A. R.
P. synod held their annual meeting
in the Newberry church October 4th
and 5th. The attendance was good
and the spirit of interest and enthusiasm
was manifest in all the sessions
of the union. The delegates were entertained
in the homes of the city with
J lunch at the church on 'Wednesday and
Thursday.
The president of the union is Mrs.
M. W. Rhodes of Louisville, Gaand
the secretary, Mrs. C. E. Miller of
Atlanta. These were most efficient
and kept the business of the union
well in hand.
The words of welcome were spoken
by Mrs. W. Y. Fair, to which responce
was made by Mrs. ^Rhodes.
in addition lo tae regular vuoiucm
of the union a number of interesting
and helpful conferences were held.
On Wednesday morning a conference
was held on the thank offerings with
Mrs. J. M. Cuddy of Troy, S. C., as
the leader. The thank offerings are
devoted to the Mountain mission and
nets a goodly sum for this encouraging
work. Mrs. J. I. Brownlee of Anlod

nal of Missions, the magazine publish-!
ed 'by the union. It was the unani- j
mos testimony that the journal is a
great help to the societies in keeping
in touch with the work and arranging
their progress. (Arrangement was
made to double the number of copies
at once.
The conference on tithing was under
the direction of Mnh. R. D. "Bryson
of Clinton and proved a very interesting
discussion. Mrs. W. 3. Lind-j
say of Charlotte who is the synodi- j
o:l secretary of junior work was
present and led the discussion Fri-1
day morning on this department of!
work. The Ladies societies are charg-!
ed with this work and the splendid
possibilities of this kind of work were
set forth bv a number of speakers.
The dscussion of the Orphanage
work led the union to create a special
department to look after this
part of the work. Mrs. I. H. Hunt of
Newberry was made secretary of this
department and will edit a page in
the Journal of Missions in the inter
est of the orphans.
Mrs. R. D. Bryson gave a demonstration
of Mission Study class. She
spoke of the importance of missinary
instruction, and said that the study
class was one of the most effective
means of imparting missionary inM

The evening sessions were devoted
to popular addresses on missions.

telling work in iMexico till the mis

that field spoke on Wednesday even,

and sympathy and moved the whole
congregation to a deeper interest in
Mexico and the people who have not
had a chance to know the true way of
life.
Dr. G. G. Parkinson of the Erskins
Thpnir.fnml seminarv delivered a
strong missionary sermon on Thursday
evening on the text: "How beautiful
are the feet of them that preach
of peace, and bring glad tidings of
good things!'' Rom. 10:15. This sermon
was vigorous in thought and presented
in his clear <nnd forcible style.
The ladies were well pleased with
f ' e fine hospitality; shown by the Newberry
people, and many expressed the
opinion that all things considered this
was one of the best meetings ever
held by the union.
