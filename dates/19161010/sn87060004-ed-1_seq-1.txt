After The War, What?
The Cincinnati Enquirer, an Inde
pendent paper with Democratic lean
ing, and which usually supports ther
the Democratic party, says of the in
dustrial outlook after the close of flic
European War:
Democrats and Republicans alike
realize that when the disbanded ar
mies return to their homes, and the
returned soldiers seek employment at
their former vocations, the mills the.
shops, the factories of Europe will be:
offered labor at low prices and that:
every wheel and every loom and ev
ery forge and every 'furnace will be
put to work using that low priced la
bor, and that its outputs will be
nresi iiir saif- in nnr maK it.'
well as the markets of every other
country on the face of the earth.
British and French, German and
Russian, Austrian and Japanese, Bel
gian and Turkish industries will be
supplied with millions of men who
have for years endured hardship anc
privations upon daily pay that would,
not provide an average American-
family with bread alone, and these?
millions must work, and will work
at starvation wages, and theamarketsv
of other nations will be swamped by
their cheaply produced produced arid
cheaply sold outputs.
Society in the United States may-
favor an eight hour day, as President
Wilson says, and every person in this
country would be delighted if our
workers could all afford to work hut
eight hours or five hours or three
hours and make profits over and
above expenses on their work at those
hours. But how about it when so
ciety in foreign lands competes with
our outputs through its outputs of
workers on one-third wages admirab
ly organized and very efficient work
ing 10, 12 and even 14 hours per
day in f reign countries? What
chances for keeping our trade in for
eign markets under these circum
stances? What prospect of keeping:
our own markets from being swamped
save by higher customs duties?
It will take all the energy, all the
knowledge, alt the wisdom of our
business men after the close of this
European war to prevent disaster to
our manufactures in many lines, and:
to prevent shutdowns and lockouts
in our industrial districts.
If the tnterests of the United States
are not made the paramount interest
by the government of the United States
if theories do not give place to
thoroughly practical ideas and meth
odsr if stalwart Americanism does
not succeed to idiosyncracies in our
foreign relations, it will not be x
Question of efrrht hours work in our
mills and shops and mines and fac
tories, but a question pf shutdowns
and no work at all.
