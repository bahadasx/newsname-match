' CRUICAL GAME
OF THE SERIES
Steady Flow of Traffic Ground

of the Day.
BATTLE ROYAL IS CERTAIN
Weather is Cool and Breezy
Better Suited for Football
Than Baseball Game.
NEW YORJX. Oct. 10.?With the
battle for the premier baseball honor
of the year transferred from Boston
to Brooklyn today the baseball en
thusiasts of greater tfew York
Hocked by the thousands to Kbbetts
Held to view the world's series from
a new angle. Brooklyn has sent many
ii large delegation to the Polo
grounds in Harlem, home of the
(Hants, to witness post season strug
gles in former years, but today saw
a reversal of the process with the
tide of travel turned towards Flat
bush, where sits the stadium occu
pied by the present National League
champions.
In contrast with the warm hazi
ness of the past few days, remark
able for Its suitability to the great
national pastime, the morning broke
cool and breezy with the promise of
a day more suited to work on the
grfdiron than on the diamond.
The ticket holders for the games
to be played on the Flatbush dia
mond?there were more than 20,000
of thom before the rush to the
prounds started?were not over 1m- j
patient to get to the playing field and
the Brooklyn traction lines were
easily able to take care of their fore
noon patrons. The thousands who
had not been forehanded, however,,
together with other thousands who
counted on winning out in the strug
gle fpr places in the unreserved sec- j
tion provided a steady flow of traf
fic groundward augmented later by
the throngs of possessors of the,
elaborately lithographed cardboard? ;
entitling them to specified seats wlth-j
in the playing arent. Long before
game time there was every indica
tion that the stadium at the call of *
play would be filled to the limit of
Its 26,000 cKpaclty.
The struggle of the day. coming
after the two desperate encounters j
In Boston, which left the Brooklyn." j
without a ?'ictory and gave the Tied
Sox a commanding lead in the battle
for the*title, prorfiised to be perhaps
the "cruclar* game of the series. The
probable lineups of the teams for
today's game is as follows:
Brooklyn. Iloston.

Monster Crowd Turns Out for
Political Rally in School
house at Sardis.
SAUDIS, Oct. 10.?One of the great
est crowds that ever turned nut to
hear a political speaking here was
present Monday night at the Sardis
school house at a monster political
rally, which was addressed by several
of the Republican county candidates.
It was a regular old fashioned Repub
lican jamboree. The crowd was most
enthusiastic and every time a speaker
showed up the Democratic misrepre
sentations in their true light the ap
plause was loud and long.
The speakers who addressed the
meeting wore R. M. Fisher, candidate
for house of delegates; Will R Morris,
candidate for prosecuting attorney;
Ira I., Swiger. nominee for assessor;
Charles A. Sutton, candidate for Judge
of the criminal court; Uovd n. Orlflin,
nominee for sheriff; and S. R. Harri
son. .Jr.. candidate for the house of
delegates.
The meeting was called to order by
L. M. Hustcad and the speeches fol.
lowed. Because of the number of
speakers, the speeches were necessar
ily short, but every one bristled with
good old Republican doctrine?the
doctrine that has brought prosperity
to the American people without the
aid of a foreign war, the kind that has
upheld American rights at home nnd
abroad.
Republicans of the district are unit
ed this year and even manv Democrats
concede that the O. O. P."tickets will
carry tho district by over 200 votes.

not yet determined, neither have I
made any plans", he added. "I ex
pect to go to Washington but when
I do not know. 1 am glad to be

crew of the British freight steamship
Kingstonian, missing since Sunday
when its members abandoned the ship
at the order or the German raiding
submarine in the waters off Nantuck
et shoals lightship, had not been
heard from Tuesday. Eleven torpedo
boat destroyers were despatched to
the vicinity of the lightship by Rear
Admiral Gleaves to continue the
search.
No further report of the submarine
or submarines which restroyed six
steamships Sunday on the trans-At
lantic lane that rounds the lightship
same to hand Tuesday. There has
been no trace of the submersible since
its last victim went to the bottom
Sunday night.
Search for the missing crew said to
number more than fifty men was
halted Monday on receipt of reports
that some of them had been found.
There was no confirmation from any
source by wireless and in fact the
report was officially denied. As the
men had been afloat for more than
thirty-six hours in open boats and
probably without food or adequate
clothing the anxiety on the part of the
destroyer fleet to locate them became
more intense especially as the weath
er Monday night became extremely
cold.

' of Daniel Huffman, an aged farmer
and Baptist preacher of Gilmer coun
j ty, which pave the major part of
. his estate to tho defendants.
The estate consists mostly of
, realty in Gilmer. Braxton and Cal
' houn counties, which of late years
have accumulated greatly in value,
. being now worth in excess of $50,
! 000, perhaps as much as $100,000.
| It is contended by the plaintiffs, who
i are the heirs at law of Daniel Huff
man. that he was so feeble physical
ly and mentaly at the time of deed
ing the property that he was in
capable of doing so legally. Daniel
HufTman died In March, 1916, at the

ro EXPONENT
FOm SLUR
One of Leading Townsmen
Minces No Words in Allusion
to the Wilson Course.
(By I/. K. IMiIiiimIn.)
i That ninny other votors In this
nelghhorhod who have boon made to
. fuel ashamed of their native land (hv
, reason of the rorelgn policies or tile
Wood row Wilson administration)
I may be defended In their position
along with myself, I answer the free
advertising given me In the mornlni;
1 newspaper.
The man who penned those lines
I was either a fool or al heart know
ingly misrepresented the matter by
the use of that conventional little
word "If." or course, no one Is
I ashamed or his country on account of
lt? virtues, but we must feel ashamed
of Its mistakes before we can see the
need of remedying them, and we be
llevo there is shame enough In the
country to apply the remedy on elec
tion day. As to those who nre
ashamed of their country's diplomacy
(under the guiding hand of Woodrow !
Wilson) going to Europe to seek
bloodshed, allow me to say that not
all of the people in Europe are light
ing. only the soldiers. The soldiers
are being slaughtered. Our country
him all It# available Holdlern and ro
serve (National Guard) In the field.
Our soldiers are being slaughtered,
our countrymen's properly being de
stroyed, nnd we dignifying Hie pro
cedure by calling it peace, according
to the "Woodrow" interpretation
Europe calls It war. You have but
little chance, except In matter of ex
tent. We even note by the papers
I that the government at Washington
; is afraid some portion nf our domain
I will be blown up by Europo's tight.
! conducted at our front door. What
we believe in and admire is a neu
. trallty such as this country maintain
ed during the war between Kussin
jand Japan, when the chief executive
of the United StateH was practically
the referee, and a potent factor In the
adjustment of the terms of peace
acquitting himself with honor to
himself and country. On the other
hand If war must come wc admire an
honorable war. such as wc had un
der McKlnley, wherein the blood
shed was less thnn that under the
Woodrow peace plan and the war tax
about the same. Let those admire
who will, but for me I do not admire
a spineless Imitation of a man or
administration made up of theories
that are not good enough ror him or
Itself to adhere to on all occasions.
As man or nation we must com
mand respect If we expect to receive
It. Cowardice Is not a guarantee
against attack.
WAItHANT DISMISSED.
