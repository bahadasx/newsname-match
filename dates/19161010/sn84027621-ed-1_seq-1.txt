THE PROBLEM
CREATED IN AUSTRO-IIUNGARY
BY INABILITY TO SECURE
AMERICAN COTTON
(Associated Press)
Vienna, Oct. 10. Paper has proved
of extraordinary value as a substitute
for cotton since the American crop
was cut off, helping solve one of Aus-tro-IIungary's
great economic prob
lems, Arthur Kuffler, president of the
war association of ; cotton spinners,
told the Associated Press. He exhibit

from a mixture of paper yarn as the

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
SPOKE IN OCALA
The republican campaign speaking
al; the courthouse last evening drew
quite a good crowd, about half of
those present being colored. All the
speakers were accorded an attentive
hearing, and at times they were ap
plauded. '
Mr. George W. Neville of Dunnel-
lon, chairman of the county executive
committee, was master of ceremonies
and introduced the speakers.
Mr. Allen of Key West, nominee of
the party for governor, was the first
speaker, and led. off with the advice
that Marion county ; people - support
Judge William Gober for representa
tive in Congress and in, that way get
protection of the citrus fruit industry.
He also boosted the cause of Mr. J. M.
Cheney of Orlando, for justice of the
supreme court, declaring- him to be
just the man for the place.
Mr. Allen said he wras not asking
the democrats to vote for him, but
was simply traveling the state to let
the voter look him over, though he had
been assured he would receive a large
vote because of the "muddle" between
the other gubernatorial nominees. He
cited the election in Maine as an ex
ample of what people sometimes did
when the party leaders placed them
selves in a position not desirable to
the voters. "We need political diver
sion in Florida," said Mr. Allen, and
he declared that - the present outlook
was that we would have it after the
November election.
Mr. Cheney said that the election of
Judge Gober to Congress was what
the people of this district needed, as
mis wouia Dnng about protection to
the citrus fruit ..and other industries
which were the life of Florida. He
declared that the whole country need
ed a change of administration, and in
proof recounted the stand of the pres
ent one in its Philippine. Mexican and
other policies of the past few years.
declaring that with a republican in
the chair our national honor would be
better protected. He said that the re
publican party had seen the error of
its tactics of the last campaign and
was now one grand united organiza
tion as of yore "going forward to vic
tory." He told the democratic voters
in his audience that they were dis
satisfied with their primary law, their
nominations and the actions of their
leaders of late, and implored them not
to be ashamed to vote their honest
convictions at the November election
and help' to rid themselves of the
whole outfit, and get1 their share of
the great ."protection" wave that
would hit us after the election. '
Mr. Bishop of Eustis, candidate for
Congress from his district, made a
speech for his friends Allen, Cheney
and Gober,' telling . our people of the

speakers, and said he had no inten
tion of keeping the audience longer,
as he and his principles were well
known to his hearers, : besides the
political ground had been covered by
those who preceded him. He how

reasons for his recent affiliations with
