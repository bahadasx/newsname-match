Washington, Oct. 10.—Figures make
dry reading oftentimes, but when they
tell the story of our prosperity and
our daily lesson in economics is view
ed in the light of political conditions
of the old world and the political
fighting of the new world, the figures
may- well become illumed and interest
ing. It is worth while to ponder over
the report of the U. S. bureau of crop
statistics of the department of agri
culture in the summary of the Octo
ber crop report for the state of North
Dakota and for the United States, re
membering that the war in Europe is
responsible for the splendid prices the
farmer is obtaining, but in no way re

MYSTERY SHROUDS
U-53 WHEREABOUTS
American Importers Have
Put $100,000,000 Goods
in Warehouses.
New York. Oct. 10.—One day and
night without further news of the U
53 has not quieted any of the anxiety
shipping circles caused by the activi
ties of the submarine commerce raid
er at the bend of the Great North At
lantic highway off Nantucket. If any
thing, the disappearance of the raider
and the mystery concerning her loca
tion, increased the precautions of
owners and agents of vessels of the
entente nations. Trans-Atlantic liners
and freight steamers approached this
port today by courses carrying them
far out of the customary lane. Car
goes worth millions are at stake in
the game of hide and seek. Exporters
announced today that the submarine
raid, with its consequent advance in
insurance rates, will check shipments
from New York to European ports.
American importers are. in part,
prepared for the interruption of trans
Atlantic trade, which might result
from the submarine raids, It was
learned to day. In anticipation of the
shortage of European goods, they
have placed in bonded warehouses on
the Atlantic coast foreign merchan
dise valued at $100,000,000.
Vessels Stay in Port.
Philadelphia. Oct. 10.—-No vessels
flying foreign flags have cleared from
this port since the reports of the Ger

SAY, GERARD'S
ONLY COMMENT
Ambassador Neither Affirms
Nor Denies Peace
Reports.
NOT PEACE MISSION.
long Branch, N. J„ Oct. 10.—
Ambassador Gerard, who arrived
at New York today from Germany,
Is not expected to see President
Wilson until next week. It was
stated authoritatively here that
-Gerard does not come on any peace
mission, and that his trip has no
connection with tho submarine
warfare, but he simply is on a va
cation.
New York, Oct. 10.—.Tames W.
Gerard, American ambassador to Ger
many, upon his arrival here today
declined either to affirm or deny pub
lished reports that he was returning
to the United States on a peace mis
sion in behalf of the emperor of Ger
many. Gerard's attention was called
to the story appearing in this morn
ing's New York World to the effect
that his errand was to inform the
administration that the renewal of
the submarine activity was being con
sidered by Germany in a manner
which might threaten German-Amsr
ican relations.
"You don't see me quoted anywhere
in it do you?" was his answer.
To questions asked by reporters at
quarantine, Gerard replied.
"It is useless to question me boys
cannot say a word. The length of
my stay here has not yet been deter
mined, neither have I made any
plans. I expect to go to Washington,
but when, I do not know."
London Thinks Time is
Not Ripe for Peace Talk
London, Oct. 10.—Wall street's
break on the reports that Ambassa
dor Gerard is taking to Washington
the kaiser's peace terms is regarded
here rather as an ilndex to the specu
lative posliton in New York than as
an Indication of any value in the in
ternational situation.
Whether or not Mr. Gerard has un
dertaken to act in any such capacity
Is a question of which, no one here
claims any knowledge, although spec
ulation Is rife. But the opinion is
practically unanimous that the time
is not ripe for the successful intima
tion of peace negotiations.
It Is, of course, well understood that
neither Mr. Gerard, in case he Is car
rying an offer, nor Mr. Wilson, in the
event of his putting proposals before
the allies, would be doing anything
but their plain duty as neutrals.
Such, a step by Mr. Wilson would
Dot necessarily'.Imply that he second
ed the motion, and in well-informed
quarters here, it is not believed that
Mr. Wilson will Identify himself with
any mediation proposal unless he un
derstands his good offices are desired
by both sides.
Were any delnite proposals for
peace made officially on behalf of the
German government they would be
submitted for the consideration of all
the allied governments and the de
cision would rest, not with England
or France or Russia, but with all
three jointly.
Outside of the practically, negligible
number of pacifists, the overwhelm
ing concensus in this country Is that
no useful purpose can yet ibe served
by efforts to substitute the machinery
of negotiation for the decisions of
war.

President of Farmers' Union
Says Congress Must Fix
it Quickly.
Fort Worth, Texas, Oct. 10.—H. N.
Pope, president of the Association of
Farmers' union presidents, has Issued
a statement asking the farmers to
urge their congressmen to repeal the
A damson law at the next session of
congress. Mr. Pope has issued a
pamphlet analyzing the effect of this
law on agricultural Interests. He de
nounces the law as offending the
covenant which our government made
the people to give equal rights to all,
and special privileges to none. His
statement says in part:
"The defenders of the Adatnson law
have had much to say about emanci
pating labor, but how about enslav
ing the farmer? If giving to the
trainmen is a virtue, is not taking
from the farmer a crime?
"Has congress the power to increase
the expenses of industry many jiiil
lions of dollars without someotfe pay
ing the bill? If so then congress
should Immediately assemble^ and
legislate all the people ftito idleness
and wealth. This law is unsound in
principle and unjust in application.
"If we are to extend this character
of benevolent legislation to all railroad
employes as well as to the employes
of all other lines of industry, it will
take the entire American wheat crop
to finance the Adamson law. This is
an annual contribution which the
farmers of the nation are not financi
ally able to make and the only way
to prevent it Is to persuade our con
gressmen, no matter of what poli
tical faith, to take this law off the
statute book- The question is not
whether this or that political party
should rule, but whether congress has
power to take the oat crop from the
American farmer and give it to the
trainmen whether our government
has authority to force one class of
citizens to turn over property to any
other class without compen&astion. If
this character of legislation Is permit
ted to inhabit our statute books, then
property has no rights that congress
is bound to resspect."
GERMANS REJOICE
OVER U-53 DEEDS
AS DARING VICTORY
Amsterdam, Qct. 10.—(Via Lon
don.)—A Berlin telegram says the
Lokal Anzeiger refers to the visit of
the U-53 to America as an unexpected
and brilliant victory for German tech
nique and German daring. It says the
U-53 abided strictly by international
regulations, under which, as a war
vessal she was not entitled to remain
longer than twenty-four hours in
neutral waters.
This fact, the Lokal Anzeiger says,
is of political as well as technical sig
nificance- The newspaper continues:
"it appears as a silent answer to
the last note of the entente in which
it was asserted German boats had
secret provisioning bases In waters of
neutral, countries and that It was,
therefore, in accordance with inter
national law to refuse them protec
tion. It is now proved publicly that
German boats require no interven
ing power to cover long routes.
Thanks are due the heroes who
achieved this exploit."

Clearing House Shows an
Enormous Total of 4
$14«va^ 709,000.
New York, Oct. 10.—There are in
numerable indices to the wonderful
changes worked in the position of the
•United States in relation to the
world's trade as a direct and un
avoidable consequence of the great
war, but none of them is more strik
ing than the increase in the work of
the New York Clearing House associa
tion. The first year of war, 1915, was
one of depression, at leapt until the
final days, and the transactions re
ported for that period were not un
usual, having been exceeded eight
times since 1905. The year ending
Oct, 7, 1916, reflected the full force of
the war's influence on business in this
country.
The United States, as the principal
neutral nation, and the greatest pro
ducer of foodstuffs and other materi
als needed by the belligerents, ex
perienced a demand for its products
that was totally unexpected, and most
of these moved through the port of
New York. Simlliarly. the tremend
ous financial operations incident to
the purchase of munitions and food
stuffs centred at the metropolis. These
operations, involving the receipt of
subscriptions for foreign loans, the
proceeds of securities sold here by
foreign governments, and the deposits
of gold on one hand, and the pay
ment of exporters and contractors on
the other, greatly added to the de
posits and payments of the big
downtown banks. The tendency of
New York to become the leading fi
nancial centre of the world is clearly
shown in the growth of the work done
by the clearing house.
The clearings for last year reached
the total, almost heyond human com
prehension. of $147,180,709,000, with
a dally average of $484,147,000- The
clearings last year alone nearly
equaled the combined total of the first
thirteen years of the Clearing House's
operations or from 1854 to 1866 In
clusive. The increase in 1916 over
1915 was greater than the total clear
ings for the year 1900, and substanti
ally equal to those of the largest year
experienced up to that time. The
dally average was just twice that for
the year 1908.

ing back the Boston Americans by a
score of 4 to 3. The series now stands:
Boston Americans 2, Brooklyn Na
tionals 1.
It was Brooklyn's lusty stickwork
that brought over the winning runs
for the National league champions.
They had no difficulty negotiating
Mays' underhand ball. The home folks
played a smart fieldiog game and not
an error marred their play. The old
veteran. Jack Coombs, started in the
box for Brooklyn, but he began to
lose his effectiveness in the sixth in
ning, when Boston put over two runs
and in the seventh when Gardner
knocked the ball over the fence for
a home run. Coombs signalled for a
relief pitched. The official box score:
