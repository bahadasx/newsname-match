BOSTON, Oct. 9. Breaking
' world's series records and teasing
teasing tradition to spread, the
Boston Americans defeated the
Brooklyn nationals by a score of
two to one in a 144-inning game
here this afternoon. It was the
second contest for be champion-
. ship and was decided only after a
struggle that surpassed in a situa
tion any ,e,ver evolved in the fer
tile mind of a baseball fiction writ-
er. i ' '
For more than two hours the
tean s, pennant winners in their
respective leagues, battled wih
almost superhuman skill and coui
age throueh a one run tie. Then,
wUh the stage set as if for the de
riding climax, a pinch hitter and
a pinch runner won victory for the
Red Sox just as twilight threw its
mantle of . semi-darkness, over
Braves Field.
Gainor, Man of Hour
Of the heroes who arose from
the playing field the warriors
from the dragon s teeth sown as
in tnles of Greek mythology. Deles
Gainer, of Elkins, V. Va., was the
star of stars.
Myers Starts It
It was his single in the gathering
darkness of the final inning that scor
ed from second base Michael McNally
of Minooka. Fa., running for HoblitzI
with the tally that won the second
straight victory for the Carriganites
over the champions of the sen'.or
league. The contest opened with a
sensational circuit srrash by Hy My
ers in the initial inning, and not for
a moment afterward did the struggle
halt or lose" in interest for the forty
odd thousand fans who hung on every
play with intensity equal to that of the
members of the two teams battling
for fame and financial rewards.
Scott Ties Score
For a short space of time the lone
ruu scored by Myers appeared to be
the margin that might give Brooklyn
an even break in the series. In the
third inning, however, Scott tripled to
center and scored the tying run when
Cutshaw juggled Ruth's tap", and had
time only to make the play at first
base.
Thrills Without End
From that point the Red Sox and
the Supcrbas grappled in a baseball
battle that rolled through 11
periods '
of play without there being a score by
cither club, while diamond deeds of
amazing daring and skill held the spec
tators enthralled. Sizzling hits, won
derful catches, scintillating throws,
and the keenest of baseball general
ship succeeded each other so rapidly
that those preceding were forgotten
in the stunning brilliancy of later
events.

i Wholesale Raid Is Believed to
Have Been Work of One
Lone Submarine Destruc
tive Work Subsides for Day
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEWPORT, R. I.. Oct 9. The
wholesale raid on foreign shipping
south of Nantucket lightship Sunday
was the work of one submarine, ac
cording to reports of American naval
officers. '
Only the U-53.
Rear-Admiral Cleaves, commanding
; the torpedo boat destroyer flotilla,
j which did such remarkably ' speedy
; rescue work yesterday, said that the
j reports of all his officers showed that I
to the best of their observation the j
' raid was made by one essel, the Ger- j
i man U-53, which called at Newport
i Saturday afternoon to mail a letter to I
' Ambassador Bernstorff and then put I
to sea without taking on an ounce of .
; supplies, although she had been 17
days from her base, according to the
statement of her officers.
! Appears as Two.
Admiral Gleaves said he could easi
ly understand the positive statement
of the captain of the Nantucket Light
ship and Of sailors of the torpedoed
vessels that more than one submarine
was concerned. The U-boat, he said,
was very fast and appeared to have
been handled cleverly. It was easy.
j he pointed out, for her to disappear
I on one side -of a ship and then show
i up unexpectedly at another spot
Doubtless, he believes, she had sub
merged and reappeared often enough
. to mislead any but a keep professional
I observer and to create the inipressl.m
that more than one sea terror was
operating.
This opinion would seem to be i
borne out by the statement Of many
refugees of the torpedoed boats.
Lieutenant Commander Miller, of the
; destroyer Erickson, who witnessed the
i destruction of the Stephano, said he
was positive that only one submarine
was ln the at thnektime'
rjday tn Bl,J,g8 ceased at
least for the moment. The known list
or vlctis or the U-53 Sunday exploits
remains at six, notwithstanding re
ports from the Nantucket lightship
that three other ships, the identity of
which could not be learned, were sent
to the bottom.
There also was a per-
sistent rumor, without verification
that a British cruiser one of the allied
patrols sent to the submarine zone
had been attacked.
Think All Safe
WASHINGTON. Oct. 9. Rear Ad
miral Knight at Newport reported to
the navy department tonight that al-
i though the American destroyer flotilla
was continuing its search for the miss
I ing crew of the British steamer Kings-
ton, he thought it likely that they had
. been picked up by some east bound
I merchantman which had taken them
I out to sea without reporting because
of fear that use or her wireless would
endanger her.
NORWAY SHIP SINKS
LONDON, Oct 9. Lloyd's announce
that the Norwegian steamer Risholra
has been sunk.
Cochise, but before he came here, was
such that the United States govern
ment refused to grant his application

LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct. 9
Secretary Lansing, it was an
nounced tonight, will come here
tomorrow for a conference with
President Wilson concerning Ger
man submarine raids of the Amer
ican coast. Mr. Lansing is expect
ed to remain over night at the
President's summer residence.
LONG BRANCH, N. J. Oct. 9. The
announcement that the secretary of
state would confer with the President
confirmed the impression gained here
earlier in the day that the American
government considered the attacks on
vessels off the American coast by a
German submarine as fraught with
grave possibilities. At the same time
Is was made clear that there is nothing
in the reports so far received to show
that international law or the earlier
promises of Germany have been vio
lated. Concern over the situation
centered chiefly about the possibility
of what might happen if the submar
ine attacks are continued.
Awaits Investigation.
The position of the American gov
ernment and its determination to make
a full investigation before acting was
made rlea in the following statement
given out by the President:
U. S. to Uphold Rights.
"The government will, of course,
first inform itself as to all the facts
that there may be no doubt or mistake
as rar as they are concerned. The
country may rest assured that the Ger
man government will be held to the
complete fulfillment of its promises to
the government of the United States. I
have no right now to question its will
ingness to fulfill them." '
Count von Bernstorff the German
ambassador who came here today to
give the President a per.-tonal letter
from the German emperor on Polish
relief, discussed with President Wil
son the new activities of German sub
marines. It was understood that the
President made it clear that while the
American government had no inten
tion of Interferring with the legitimate
acts of the submarine, it would insist
on the strict observance of the pledges
given previously by the German fcOv
ernment Bernstorff Surprised
The ambassador, while expressing
an entire lack of official information,
promised to conduct her submarine
warfare in accordance with the law of
cruiser warfare.
The ambassador remained with the
President only fifteen minuets and
was smiling when he left. He declar
ed he was as much surprised as any
body when the news of the sinking of
the first British ship reached him.
It is understood that the talk be
tween the President and the ambassa
dor was entirely friendly, but that the
President informed the ambassador of
his determination to act firmly if the
rights of the United States are in
fringed upon.
The President had seriously consid
ered going to Brooklyn tomorrow to at
tend the third world's series gasegall
game, but decided to remain here and
keep in touch with the submarine situ
ation. During the day the executive offices
here were in communication with Sec
retary Daniels and receied preliminary
reports assembled by the navy depart
ment on the submarine activities off
the American coast. The general
trend Of these reports were in effect
that so far the rules of international
law had been complied with by Ger
many. It was made clear, however,
that these reports were of a prelimin
ary character and were not conclusive
Secretary Daniels was instructed to
keep the President fully informed.

SUNK BY WHOLESALE
NEW PORT. R. I.. Oct. 9. The sto
ry or how ships came within range of
a U-boat raid so fast on Sunday off
Nantucket that she had to keep one
waiting while she disposed -f ar.o;h
er. was told today by Art'iur Gray,
wireless operato" on th.? Norwegian
steamer Christian Knudn. The
Knudsen was sunk about 3 o'cliok
yesterday morning, and thi crw row
ed about in s-rall boats for ten hours
before being picked up by a boat irom
the Nantucket Shoals ligh'ship.
"We heard the sound or firing some
time before the submarine hove in
sight." Gray said today, "but by the
time we had discovered that a sub
marine was operating in our vicinity
it was too late to escape. When we
came onto the scene ot action the un
derwster boat wa engaged with the
British steamer Stephano. While the
passengers and crew of the Stephano
were disn:bar:is. the U iniat ran
along-.! le the Kr'.'dsen ard ordered
us to steam nearer the S'ephano.
U. S. Destroyer On Hand
"While the submarine was along
side the Knudsen waiting for the cap
tain to take his papers aboard, one of
the I'nited States destroyers came
into view. Almost immediately the
submarine submerged and remained
under water until the destroyer came
near to be recognized as a neutral
vessel, when she came to the surface
and continued her work.
"We were told to pack up our be
longings and leave the ship, which we
at once began to do. W'e had plenty
of time to get off while the submarine
was disposing of the other vessel. We
had rowed some distance away before
the submarine fired on the Knudsen.
She fired at least 150 shots and these
not having the desired effect, she cut
locse a torpedo which struck the ves
sel and she soon went down."
Hasty in Shelling
NEW YORK. Oct. 9. Thirteen shots
were fired at the British steamer
Strathleen, one of the vessels sunk by
a German subamrine yesterday, before
the 33 members of the crew had taken
to their boats, according to Captain
Wilson, commander of the Strathleen
who was brought here today.
"My ship was attacked without warn
Ing." declared Captain Wilson after he
had given a detailed statement of the
incident to the British consul general.
"Thirteen shots were fired before we
left the vessel. None of the shots,
however, struck the ship until we had
taken to the boats."
