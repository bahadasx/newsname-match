Ship Owners Worried
.New York, Oct 9.—Owners, agents
and others Interested in vessels near
the Atlantic coast flying the flags of
nations hostile to Germany passed an
uneasy night and today sought every
possible avenue of news regarding
their ships. Many* of the vessels with
in the German boat danger sone
carry scores of American and Euro
pean
passengers, including same not
able in financial, business, theatrical
and social circles.
It seemed doubtful today that the
submarine raid would result in a gen
eral tleup of the shipping of the en
tente nations in American ports but
one of the most important steamship
companies controlling both British and
American*, the International Mercan
tile Marine Co., issued orders that no
British ships of that line should leave
Atlantic ports pending further orders.
The order will not Interfere with the
sailing of the American line steam
ships or of any of the company's ves
sels under the American flag.
Cunard 8hips Armedl^:
Officials of the Cunard, French and
•f the Italian lines declared that their
passenger and freight vessels would
sal! as usual despite the submarine
menace. All Cunard vessels, it was
pointed out, are armed with 4.7 inch
guns and the German submarines thus
far have avoided vessels so armed.
The Alaunia, of the Cunard line, which
sailed from here Saturday after word
had been received of the arrival of the
U-53 at Newport carried one of these
guns on her afterdeck.
8hips Are Warned.
More than a score of passenger and
freight steamers are believed today to
be near Nantucket Some are bound
to New Tork from foreign ports and
others eastbound from here. A con
siderable number of them are believed
to be laden with war munitions.
Most important among them are the
passenger steamships Cameronia. Dan
te Allghlerl, Sspagne, Philadelphia and
Krlstlanlaf]ord. The Anchor liner
Cameronia Is due here today from Liv
erpool with six hundred passengers.
Wireless warnings were sent to Capt.
McLean yesterday directing him to
look out for the U-53.
The French line steamer Espagne is
due to arrive tonight or tomorrow
from Bordeaux bringing a number of
Americans. It is said. Warnings were
sent to her captain.

SUBMARINES CAUSE
NEW COMPLICATION
UNITED 8TATE8 AUTHORITIES
FEAR THERE WILL BE BREECH
OF NEUTRALITY.
IPwifN:
Washington, D. C., Oct 9.— Possi
bilities of diplomatic complications
over the German submarine raid along
the New England coast seemed today
tto point toward the allies as well as
Germany.
State and navy officials, scanning
unofficial reports of the destruction of
ships within sight of American shores,
found no reason today to change their
first impression that the submarine
operations had been conducted, so far,
within the limitations of international
law, but they were fully alive to the
dangerous possibilities. Destruction
of an American ship carrying contra
band might easily cause'another Frye
case and any loss of life at all in any
case might easily reopen the whole
submarine question.
The threatened complication with
the allies lies in their contention that
submarines, because of their nature,
should be excluded from all neutral
ports. Today's London dispatches
quoting from the Manchester Guardian
to the effect that such a view has been
"set out In the recent memorandum
sent by the allies to neutral govern
ments," contained the first intimation
received here that anything in the
nature of a formal representation had
been made.
No Issue Raised Yet
The position of the United States,
as far as It has been announced, has
been to decide on its merits the case
of each submarine entering an Amer
ican port. Inasmuch as the German
submersible which entered Newport
Saturday took no supplies, asked for
no privileges and departed almost im
mediately, it Is not thought that she
raised any issue.
The general opinion prevailed today
was that with the gathering of allied
cruisers off the New England coast the
submarines would desert that field
and strike their next blows farther
south. 8ome officials expected to hear
of operations in the Gulf of Mexico,
where a persistent story says a Ger
man base has been established and
where? the submarines could strike at
Wilson Being Informed.
The American government's attitude
toward the German side of the new
situation will of course be decided by
President'1 Wilson himself. Full infor
mation is being gathered through
official channels and forwarded to the
summer white bouse.
Secretary Lansing, who returned to
his desk today after an absence be
cause of illness, refused to discuss the
situation at all, saying his reports were
not sufficient to warrant a decision on
any of its phases.
which picked up passengers and crews
of several of the vessels destroyed,
nine merchant ships were sunk.
One of the submarines is supposed
to have been the U-53, which visited
this harbor Saturday, and another was
declared to be the U-61. Mrs. Henry
B. Wilson of Williams town, Mass., a
passenger on the Stephano, one of the
vessels sunk, said that an officer and
several of the crew told her that they
had distinctly seen the name U-61 on
the submarine that attacked their ship.
Six vessels are known to have been
sunk and the report that the total was
nine was based on a statement of the
captain of the Nantucket shoals light
ship near which the attacks took place.
The captain ^said that three subma
rines were engaged.
The list of submarine victims in
cluded four British, one Norwegian
and one Dutch vessel. The identity
of the other three reported to have
been lost had not been learned early
today. The British vessels were the
freighter West Point, bound from Lon
don for Newport News the Strath
dene, from New York to Bordeaux
the Kingston, destination not stated,
and the passenger steamer Stephano,
of the Red Cross line, from St. Johns,
N. F., for New York.
The Bioomersdijk, Dutoh, bound
from New York for Rotterdam via
Kirkwall, and the Christian Knudsen,
a Norwegian tanker, are the others,,
whose identity is known.
No Lives Lost
Newport summer colony.
It was believed that no lives had
been lost and although the men of the
freighter Kingston were reported
adrift at sea In open boats, the fact
that the weather was mild and the sea
calm made it seem probable that they
would be rescued within a few hours
by some of the searching craft
Of the passengers of the Stephano,
thirty were American tourists return
ing from Newfoundland and the Can
adian maritime provinces. All came
through their rough experience with
out injury, according to officers of the
American destroyers, but lost nearly
all their effects.

Braves' field, Boston, Oct. 9.—The
Boston Americans, with one victory
notched in their bat handles, met the
Brooklyn Nationals here this after
noon in the second game of the world's

"If we can split with the Red Sox
on their own grounds," said Capt. Jake
Daubert of the Brooklyns today,
"there will be no holding us when we
get back home."
Manager Bill Carrlgan admits that
the Bostons are going to have no walk
away. "The Brooklyns carry a punch,"
he remarked, "and the game with
them is never over until the last man
Is out. I think, though, we have the
pitchers to stop them."
Toward game time the sky became
overcast with thunderclouds that gave
a threat of showers. The weather was
hot and sticky.
The crowds came late and there was
early estimates that more than 30,000

FAVOR SHORT DAY
CANDIDATE MAKES IT PLAlh HE
,,, AND PARTY ARE FRIENDS
OF LABOR.
Newark, N. J., Oct. 9.—Charles E.
Hughes, republican candidate for the
presidency, delivered a campaign
speech here this afternoon in which
he denounced the Adamson railroad
law and methods used "by the adminis
tration to get it passed in the closing
hours of congress. He endeavored to
make clear that be is not attacking
the eight hour day principle, nor any
honest endeavors to increase wages.
He claimed that the republican party
and he himself are already on record
in numerous instances In favor of the
eight hour day, of reasonable and fair
rates of pay, and of the best possible
working conditions. The speaker said
in part:
Record of Republicans.
"The republican party has not been
opposed to the principle of an eight
hour work day. Many years ago a re
publican congress provided that eight
hours should constitute a day's work
for laborers, workmen and mechanics
employed by 'the United States. In
189% it was provided that all laborers
and mechanics employed by the Unit
ed States, by the District of Columbia
or by any contractor or sub-contractor,
upon any of the public works of the
United States, or with the District of
Columbia, should be limited to eight
houra work a day and employment for
a longer period was punishable by fine
or imprisonment or both. In 1901 con
gress directed that in all irrigation
construction work eight hours should
constitute a day's work. In 1912 pro
vision waa made that letter carriers
in the city delivery service and clerks
In second class postofflces should not
be required to, work more than eight
hours a day except in case of exigency.

Improper Legislation.
"Hitherto the American Federation
of Labor has not favored legislation
limiting hours or fixing wages for
adult labor in other than governmen
tal employments. In November, 1914,
I understand that the federation adopt
ed the following resolution:
'Resolved, that the American Fed
eration of Labor as in the past, de
clares that the regulation of igages
and hours of labor should be undertak
en through trades union activity and
not by legislation, except insofar as
the employment of women and chil
dren, health and morals,
!and
the em­
ployes of the national, state and muni
cipal governments are affected.'
"This was approved again by the
federation in November, 1915. Not, at
the outset, did the brotherhoods seek
to attain their ends by legislation. It
was through the action of the admin
istration that the Adamson bill was
demanded. The administration threw
up its hands, abandoned the principle
of arbitration, abandoned the principle
of fair inquiry before the legislative
action, and in a panic of fear rushed
to congress to get this bill passed as
the price of peace. The Adamson bill
thus came to embody the terms of a
humiliating surrender to duress.
Issue Is Fundamental.
"We have here a fundamental Issue.
It Is the issue of free government It
Is whether^ we are a government of
law, or a government by groups who
dictate edicts in the form of laws. We
cannot afford to have a terrorized ad
ministration. We can solve all prob
lems If we adhere to the rule of rea
son if we are fair, open minded and
determined to do justice to all ac
cording to the facts. There is no oth
er way, and the attempts to turn us
over to the rule of force should receive
the swift condemnation of the people."
WHEAT CROP SMALL
Government Report 8hows That
Year's Yield ia Much Below the
Average Production.
Washington, D. C., Oct 9.—With the
price of flour higher than it has been
In many years, Interest in the govern
ment's October crop report issued to
day, centered in the forecast of this
year's wheat production which Is the
smallest since 1904. The crop of win
ter wheat is 200,000,000 bushels small
er than last year and the production
of spring wheat probably will be low
er by more than that quantity and the
smallest crop in the last twenty-one
years. With a carry-over of approxi
mately 160,000,000 bushels from last
year's record breaking crop of 1,011,
505,000 bushels, agricultural depart
ment officials believed this year's
short crop would be sufficient to meet
domestic requirements and leave
about 100,000,000 bushels available for
export to help supply the heavy de
mands of the warring European na
tions. A significant feature of the
grain trade this year is the importa
tion of wheat from Argentina, a cargo
of which is now on its way to this
country.
Other cereal crops also suffered
from the adverse conditions of the
past summer and smaller productions
have resulted In most crops. White po
tatoes particularly will be short, the
crop this year being the smallest in
the last Are years. Tobacco, hay and
rice, however, promise record crops
this year.
The condition of corn throughout
the nation was given as 71.5 per cent.
The yield of spring wheat was estimat
ed at 152,861,000 btuhelfc and the yield
of all wheat at 607,557.000. The corn
yield, is estimated at 2,717.932,000 bush
