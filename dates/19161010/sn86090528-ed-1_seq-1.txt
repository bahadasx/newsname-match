FAIR BONDS
County Commissioner, However, Authorizes
Straw Yote to Feel the Pulse of
the Farmer
LEGISLATURE MAY
AUTHORIZE ISSUE
No Law Which Empowers County Com
missioners" to Ask for Bond Issue
for Permanent Fair
The farmers of Grady county will be
given an opportunity to express their
wishes respecting a $60,000' bond issue
for a permanent Grady county free
faTr with permanent buildings and this
vbte will be taken at no cost to the
county. '
Investigation of the statutes reveal
ed the fact that there is no law nr.der
the provisions of which a county is
authorized to issue bonds for the pur
p'ose indicated in the petition which
was presented to the county commis-
sioners by farmers of this community
That was -the opinion rendered by the
county attorney's office and was also
stated by attorneys of the men who
were most eager to put the plan "or
a permanent fair through. The pet!
tioners were reprfcsentd before the
board ' yesterday by Colonel O'Neill,
Ed Burton, while Ed Sheegog and
Bert Jackson were present to discuss
the Snatter as members of the legisla
ture. They all decided that the com
missioners canild not grant the petition
but in lieu of this tho board passed
the following resolution:
Authorize Straw Vote.
Resolution.
Whereas, there has been filed before
the beard of county commissioners of
Grady county, Oklahoma, a petition
asking that an election be called for
the purpose of voting bonds for the
building of permanent fair grounds in
Grady county for county free fairs, and
Whereas, the petitioning parties have
agreed to bear all the expenses of such
an election,
Now, therefore, bo it hereby resolved
by the board of county commissioners
of Grady county, Oklahoma, that the
'''"'tei of officials of each and everv
voting precinct of the county be and
they are hereby requested to submit,
on the 7th day of November, 1916, at
the general election to be held on that
date to the voters of dach and every
precinct, ballot upon which shall be
printed the question as to whether or
not there shall be issued under proper
authority, bonds in the sum of $60,000
for the erection of permanent fair
grounds in Grady county, such ballots
and all necessary supplies required in
submitting such questions to be fur
nished by the petitioning parties to
such election officials, it being special
ly understood that the county is not
to be. liable for any such supplies.
This proposition to be voted upon to
ascertain the feeling of the voters of
the county upon this question.
Passed, this the 9th day of October,
1916.
The Board of Couiuy Commissioners
of Grady County, Oklahoma.
By J. A. Corzine,
Chairman.
In the course of the discussion the
opinion was expressed that there
would be little or no trouble in getting
a bill passed during the coming legis
lature authorizing county commission
ers to take such action as was psktd
iu tha petition.
Colonel O'Neill spoke in favor of the
establishment of a permanent fair pro
viding proper authorization couid be
secured. He believed the fair would
surround the people with more oppor
tunities to improve their general con
dition than any o'ther single thing
which could be established in the coun
ty. A good fair served to eliminate
scrub stock from the farm by showing
the farmer how to raise better grade?
which eventually take the plaee of the
poor breeds. This result is seen all

By United Press.
Newport, Oct. 10. Eleven American
destroyers are steaming in line five
miles apart, sweeping the Atlantic off
Nantucket where the five or six
freighters were submarined Sunday, in
an effort to locale tho crew of the
Kingston or Kingstonian.
When Admiral Cleaves ordered tho
destroyers out at 9:20 this morning,
it was admitted that it was practically
useless to search after an all night
gale and cold weather
Shipping men feel that the wireless
operators may have missread the name
of the Christian Knudsen for tho
Kingstonian. They say if the lptter
was really sunk, the destroyers must
have found evidence of it before this
time.

Rush Springs Delegation Wins Argument
in County Meeting and Big Move
ment is Launched
SO. CANADIAN BRIDGE
IS PART OF PROGRAM
Permanent Highway North and South and
Three Lines East and West are
Proposed
Receding from the attitude taken
two week ago, citizens from various
parts of Grady county, at a, meeting
held at the city hall Monday evening,
went on record for a county bond is
sue to build bridges and hard-surface
roads and steps were taken with a
view to requesting the county coramis
sioners to call an election for that pur
pose within ninety days.
The program agreed upon contern
plates one permanent highway through
the county north and south and three
east and west roads, with such bridges
as may be needed, including one across
the South Canadian river north, of
Minco. ;
For Hard-Surface Roadt.
Rush Springs delegates, with C. W.
Harper in the lead, made the fight for
bard-surface roads, winning their ar
gument after considerable discusion.
Delegates from the north part of the
county were not disposed to view Ui
proposition witli favor but were strong
for brldg-js while those from the south
end were luke warm on bridges but in
sistent upon permanent roads. "Our
people will support no bond Issue that
doesn't include a bridge across the
Canadian," was the general sentiment
from the north end. "We are willing
for the north end to have its bridge
but we want roads and our people wilt
not favor bridge bonds unless we get
roads," was the way the south end
contingent put it. In the end it was
decided to include the demands of
both sections in the program. A com
mittee was appointed to make esti
mates on thc.crct to the taxpayers
and to report at another meeting to
be held on Monday evening, October
23, Et the same place, when steps will '
be taken for getting up petitions to
present to the county commissioners.
Not All Hot Air. .
Representatives from eight town-
j bu.iM wcrei present at the committee
meeting held at i o'clock in the after
noon to prepare a report on bridges
needed in the county. A majority of
the townships r.ot being represented,
no report was nresented. the matter
being brought up for discussion in the
general meeting in the evening. Hen
ry Mileur, of Rush Springs, 'opened
the discussion by coming out strongly
for hard-surface roads." This is not
time for anybody to be discouraged
over the road situation." said he. "It
is high time for us to get together
and thresh these matter out. They
say we don't do anything but chew the
rag at these road meeting! but I say
to you ths we need to chew the rag
long and often til! we get something
done. I believe our people will vote
bonds for hard-surface roads. We
must make a beginning somewhere.
Let us build at least one good road if
we do nothing more."
C. W. Harper, of Rush Springs, said
in part. "We had an enthusiastic meet
ing in our town Monday night and we
are going to have another next Mon
day. We figured that we cau bmiid
one hard-surface road across the coun
ty north and soufh and three east and
west, with the nrcess.u-y bridges, for
about II.O'Kt.i'Oo ami nur part of the
county is ready to vote bonds for that
purpose. We need. roads more than
do bridges iiui not vote for
lrdge unless we ge; roads."
