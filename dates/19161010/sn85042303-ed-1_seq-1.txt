AGAINST SEVERAL PLACES
WHERE IT IS ALLEGED THE
LAW IS BEING VIOLATED.
County attorney Hardy nppeared
before the district court yesterday
and asked that Injunctions he grant
ed against several resorts In the city
and county and that the sheriff be In
structed to close the places and keep
them closed until further orders of
the court.
The Injunction was granted and the

ed closed as well as four places In
that portion of the city of Ardmore
known as the reservation. The sher
iff will proceed to carry out the or

beginning of a crusade in the county
