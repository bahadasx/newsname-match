The
WOMEN GO TO JAIL
RATHER THAN SEND CHILDREN
TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.
Two Waynesburg Mothers In Jail
Here to Serve Seven Days Each
What They Say.
Having failed to pay the fines of
S5 and costs assessed against each of
them in the county court several
weeks ago for violation of the state's
compulsory education law, Mrs. Mary
Tyree and Mrs. J. E. Johnson, of the
"Waynesburg section of the county,
-were brought to jail here Monday by
Deputy Sheriff Monroe Thompson.
T2ach will be required to serve seven
days in jail on the present fines, but
as each declares she will not obey
the law and send her children to
school, they will in all probability,
have other convictions and sentences
ahead of them. Both women declare
that they will not send their children
to school, as they are taught "noth
ing but lies" in school."
Mrs. Johnson, who is a step daugh
ter of Mrs. Tvree. is a daughter of
Samuel Tyree, of the Waynesburg
section ,where they have lived for
about three years, having moved
there from Whitley City. Mrs. John
son calls herself an evangelist of the
Church of God and eenies the report
that she is a holy roller. When inter
viewed this morning by an I. J. repre
sentative, Mrs. Johnson, who is the
evangelist of this church, called the
Church of God, said that they had
nn prppd. p-cent Christ. She said.
"The law can compel us to go to I
M V.J- AnMji4- nnmnal lie Tf .
JUU, UUk taniiuu nut uiii. n.3 wv,
send our children to school, where
they are taught nothing but lies by
teachers who are not christian, and
the books that they study are
full of lies. It is against our be
lief to send our children to school, as
they are given to us to train them
the way we think best and it is our
duty to keep our children at home
and teach them the Word of God and
not send them to school to be taught
by man, claiming that God is able to
make wise the simple." Mrs. John
son quoted, "Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind," Romans
14-5, saying that .she had a right
to her belief as to how to train her
children.
- Itfrs. Johnson is the mother of five
.children from the ages of one to 13
"'-years old. Her husband is working in
Tna6hine shops at New Castle, Intl.,
- and came here last week and wanted
.. to .pay his wife's fine and move his
family to New Castle, but his wife
,' "refused to go, saying that she would
Ljtfffctfoouiitil afteishe had served her
' time in jail as it was her cross and
that she must bear it, as her Savior
liad suffered the cross for her.
Mrs. Johnson has been going to
IRockcastle and McCreary counties
for several years as an evangelist of
the Church of God, and holding
-meetings. She says that she has a
call to come to Laurel county,but has
not had time to go. Both Mrs. Tyree
and Mrs. Johnson seem perfectly con
tented in jail, as they claim that is
is their cross to bear and say they
are willing to bear with it trusting
their Master.
Jailer George Deborde did not in
carcerate the two women in the jail
proper. For one reason, it is already
full with men, of both colors, and
then, too he is able to keep them am
ply safe and secure in the jail office
Worn and to afford them a little more
privacy than they would have in the
main cell room. Mr. Deborde's ac
tion in this regard is being generally
commended, for it is felt that these
-women are, probably the victims of
some sort of religious belief or hal
lucination, and not in the same cate
gory with the usual run of malefac
tors. Mrs. Johnson was not feeling
veil Tuesday morning, so Mr. De
Borde suggested that if she thought it
Tiecessary he would secure a physi
cian at once. The woman indignant
lv repulsed his kindly offer, however,
declaring: "You know, we do not
believe in having doctors." The
accommodating jailer, says, however,
that she will certainly have one this
time, if she gets really sick while in
his charge.

Acids In Stomach
Sour Che Food and
Cause Indigestion
'Pape's Diapepsin" Fixes Sour,
Gassy, Upset Stomachs
In Five Minutes.
If what you just ate is souring on
your stomach or lies like a lump of
lead, refusing to digest, or you belch
gas and eructate sour, undigested
food, or have a feeling of dizziness,
heartburn, fullness, nausea, bad taste
in mouth and stomach headache, you
can surely get relief in five minutes.
Ask your pharmacist to show you
the formula, plainly printed on these
fifty-cent cases of Pape's Diapepsin,
then you will understand why dys
peptic troubles of all kinds must go,
and why it relieves sour, out-of-order
stomachs, or indigestion in five min
utes. "Pape's Diapepsin" is harmless;
tastes like candy, though each dose
will digest and prepare for assimila
tion into the blood all the food you
eat; besides, it makes you go to the
table with a healthy appetite; but
what pleases you most, is that you
feel that your stomach and intes
tines are clean and fresh, and you
will not need to resort to laxatives
of liver pills for biliousness or consti
pation. This city will have many "Pape's
Diapepsin" cranks, as some people
will call them, but you will be enthu
siastic about this splendid stomach
preparation, too, if you ever take it
for indigestion, gases, heartburn,
sourness, dyspepsia, or any stomach
misery.
Get some now, this minute, and rid
yourself of stomach misery and indi
gestion in five minutes. 80-1

Highest In 44 Years
Is Present Price of Cotton, Says W.
H. Shanks, Back From South
President Wm. H. Shanks, of the
Lincoln County National Bank, re
turned Saturday from Columbus,
Ga., and other southern points where
he has been for several weeks look
ing over the horse and mule and cot
ton markets. He says that condi
tions in the south are very prosper
ous at present. Cotton is selling at
16 3-4 cents a pound, the highest
price it has brought growers in 44
years. The crop is rather scarce this
season and this has helped the price
of course. Mr. Shanks says that all
of the southern states will gfve in
creased majorities for Wilson on
November 7th, for the people fully
appreciate the fact that Wilson has
kept the country at peace and pros
perous and they can see no reason
for taking a chance on a change at
such a critical stage in the affairs of
the world and this country.
Monkey Caught In Trap
Ape Which Escaped From Circus Did
Not Eat Poison After All
The famous Sparks circus monkey
has been captured at last. Dr. Hugh
Reid thought that poison he had put
out after several raids upon the fine
poultry of his son, John 0. Reid,
had "got" the ape last week, but he
was mistaken. The monk showed up
safe and sound in a large tobacco
barn a few days later, so the Messrs.
Reid fixed a box trap for him, baited
it well, and he was found in it Sun
day. Dick Robb and Walter Hiatt
brought him to town and exhibited
him at the Bailey Garage. Several
offers have been made for him, but
Dr. Reid is endeavoring to learn the
whereabouts of the Sparks show to
return the monk to his owners. He
is a valuable animal and Mr. Sparks
left word when his circus went away
that he would pay a substantial re
ward for the capture and return of
the brute. Monkeys are said to have
advanced considerably in price on
account of the war. Animal trainers
and hunters of Africa are now said
to be hunting each other, according
to their nationality, instead of hunt
ing wild beasts for American menag"
eries.
MRS. BOREING ASKS DIVORCE.
Suit has been filed in the Bell cir
cuit court by Mrs. Gertrude Boreing,
asking for a divorce from her hus
band, John R. Boreing, of London.
Mrs. Boreing also asks for the cus
tody of her three children and alimo"
ny in the sum of $25,000. They
were married in August, 1906. Mrs.
Boreing is the daughter of R. B. Lo-"
gan a prominent lawyer and capital
ist of Pineville. She has been mak
ing her home with her parents there
since she and her husband separated.
Mr. Boreing is the son of the late
Vincent Boreing, who represented
the Eleventh district in Congress
several terms. The wife asks the
court for $150 a month pending the
outcome of the trial. Attachments
have been issued against Boreing's
property to prevent him from dispos
ing of any part of his estate, estima
ted to be worth $40,000.
WEST BUYS GARRARD FARM
J. W. West, who recently sold his
home on the edge of Stanford to
George W. Carter, bought last week
of Sam Archer his farm of 51 acres
in the Point Leavell section of Gar
rard county. West gets possession
about the first of November when he
will move his family to their new
home, much to the regret of their
many friends in this section. The
Archer farm is a nice little place of
good land, about seven miles from
Lancaster. Mr. West paid $100 an
acre for it.

Sherley's Great Speech
Wins Votes For Wilson Here Mon
day McChesney's Correct Date
One of the most representative
audiences that ever was gathered to
hear a political speaker in Lincoln
county was present in the courthouse
Monday afternoon and heard a mas
terful defense of President Woodrow
Wilson's administration and the prin
ciples of Democracy by Congress
man Swagar Sherley, of Louisville.
Soon after the speaker began every
seat in the room was taken and many
had to stand in the aisles. Others
were unable to gain admittance.
That Sherley's great effort did a
lot of good here, was heard on all
sides. Several men who have voted
the Republican ticket before, are re
ported to have openly stated that
they intend to vote for Wilson for
in this hour of world peril, it is no
time to remove the master hand from
the helm when he has guided the old
ship of state through so many dan
gerous passages, and that it would
be the sheerest fotlv to put a green
hand in charge under present dan
gerous conditions. Congressman
Sherley had to catch the 2:30 train
for Louisville and consequently had
to cut his speech short, but what he
did say was to the point and a mag
nificent argument in every way. A
great many who heard Sherley pro
nounced his speech, the finest they
had ever heard from the Democratic
viewpoint. That it was a masterpiece
there is no gainsaying.
The brilliant Louisvillian was in"
troduced by Congressman Harvey
Helm, of this district, with a few
pertinent remarks, during which Mr.
Helm also called the attention of his
hearers to the grave danger of plung
ing this country into war if the ad
ministration at Washington should
be changed at the present time. Mr.
Sherley, in opening his remarks, paid
high tribute to the good work which
Helm has done for Democracy and
his people during his term of office.
MIX-UP IN McCHESNEY'S DATE.
Through a mixup in the dates, the
I. J. stated last waek that Hon. H. V.
McChesney would speak for the
Democratic ticket last Saturday at
Liberty and at Hustonville that night.
The facts are that it is next Satur
day, Oct. 14th that McChesney Is
billed for these two appointments.
He goes to Liberty for the afternoon
speech and at Hustonville that night.
Big crowds are expected to hear Mc
Chesney, both afternoon and night.
BRUNER FAILS TO SHOW UP
Republicans of Stanford and Lin
coln county were somewhat disap
pointed here Friday night when Dr.
Ben L. Bruner failed to show up for.
his speaking appointment at the
court house. The campaign com
mittee sent instead Attorney J. M.
Robsion, of Barbourville, who is said
to have made a good speech from a
republican standpoint, but, of course
not up to the argument that a sea
soned campaigner and veteran like
Dr. Bruner would have delivered.
Democrats who heard Robsion, say
he did not hurt Wilson's chances in
the least, so there you are.

Latest War News
Apparently satisfied with the rec"
ord of at least six boats sunk Sun
day, or possibly short of torpedoes,
the German submarine raids on
steamers off Nantucket were not
continued Monday. Meanwhile,
however, the operations of the Ger
man underseas craft so close to the
American shore has created a situa
tion which President Wilson and
Secretary of State Lansing will dis
cuss Tuesday at Shadow Lawn. Al
ready the President has announced
that Germany "will be held to the
complete fulfillment of its promises
to the United States" concerning
submarine warfare. Details of the
sinking of the four British and two
neutral vessels which have been
brought in by persons who were
aboard some of them indicate that
no lives were lost in the hurried
transfer from the steamers to the
ships' small boats. Torpedoboat de
stroyers have not yet located the
crew of the steamer Kingstonian, but
the belief prevails that the men may
have been picked up by some east
bound merchantman.
According to Berlin the Rumanian
troops are retreating. The Teutons
recaptured Toerzburg, fifteen miles
southwest of Kronstadt.
In considerable force the Serbians
have crossed the Cerna River into
Serbia and captured Skochivir and
other positions.
Considerable hard fighting has tak
en place in the region west of Lutsk,
but the results are clouded by con
tradictory reports.
HOW CATARRH IS CONTRACTED
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less a s otngelTienecedlebr -hacohh
less as to neglect the colds which
their children contract. The inflam
tion of the mucus membrane, at first
acute, becomes chronic and the child
has a chronic catarrh, a disease that
is seldom cured and that many prove
a life's burden. Many persons who
have this loathsome disease will re
member having had frequent colds at
the time it was contracted. A little
forethought, a bottle of Chamber
Iain's Couh Remedv Judiciously us-
ed, and all this trouble might have
been avoided. Obtainable everywhere,

BATTLE ROYAL IN GREEN
A dispatch from Greensburg, Green
county, Monday, said:
Luther Sneed is dying, his brother,
Mont Sneed, is seriously wounded,
Will and AI Rogers, and Will Rogers'
daughter, and Mrs. D. E. Hayes are
slightly wounded as a result of a
battle at the Hayes home on the Cab
bell farm, in this county, Sunday.
The Sneed boys, who live at Grady
ville, in Adair county, arrived at the
Hayes home Sunday and took pos
session of the place running Hayes
off. They brought them the daughter
of Will Rogers, whom they had forc
ed to accompany them, and held Mrs.
Hayes and her daughter in the house.
Meanwhile, the Rogers brothers had
collected a crowd of about twenty
five men, heavily armed and made an
attack on the Sneeds, who had en
trenched themselves in the Hayes
home. The Sneed boys returned the
fire and about two hundred shots
were exchanged before Luther Sneed
fell mortally wounded. Mont Sneed,
tho known to have been badly wound
ed, made his escape. Mrs. Hayes and
the Rogers girl were struck by stray
shots and though both Will and Al
Rogers were in the thick of the fray,
their wounds are not serious. Posses
are in search of Mont Sneed. It is
feared that trouble will result from
the battle, as there is great excite
ment in the vicinity.
Don't Scold Mother!
The Cross Child Is
Bilious, Feverish!
Look at Tongue! If Coated, Clean
Little Stomach, Liver,
Bowels
Don't scold your fretful, peevish
child. See if tongue is coated; this is
a sure sign its little stomach, liver
and bowels are clogged with sour
waste.
When listless, pale, feverish, full
of cold, breath bad, throat sore, does
not eat sleep or act naturally, has
stomach ache, indigestion, diarrhoea,
give a teaspoonful of "California
Syrup of Figs," and in a few hours
all the foul waste, the sour bile and
fermenting food passes out of the
bowels and you have a well and play
ful child again. Children love this
harmless "fruit laxative," and moth
ers can rest easy after giving it, be
cause it never fails to make their lit
tle "insides" clean and sweet.
Keep it handy, Mother! A little
given today saves a sick child tomor
row, but- get the genuine. Ask your
druggist for a 50-cent bottle of "Cal
ifornia Syrup of Figs," which has di
rections for babies, children of all
ages and for grown-ups plainly on
i the
bottle. Remember there are
counterfeit? sold here, so surely look
and see that yours is made by the
California Fijr Syrup Company."
Hand back with contempt any other

MULE COLT DAY
BIG LOT OF PEOPLE AND LIVE
STOCK IN TOWN MONDAY
Cattle Crowd Stock Pens While Hun..
dreds of Young Hybrids Sell on
Streets Politics Warming Up
Monday was the biggest Court
Day seen in Stanford this year from
many standpoints. A record-breaking
crowd was on hand and there was
a "world" of stock of all kinds. Oc
tober court day is usually known as
Mule Colt Day, and it is aptly nam
ed. There must have been three or
four hundred of the young hybrids
on the streets here Monday, and a
great many of them were sold. The
nrices depended largely upon the
quality. The top figure of the day
was $110, which was received by
Ben Cohen, a colored fanner on the
Danville pike for a female colt out
of a splendid brood mare which
brings him a high class mule every
year. Several breeders got $100 for
extra classy colts. There was also a
healthy demand for aged mules and
these sold all the way up to $225 a
head. So far as could be learned by
the I. J., this was the top price of
the day and was paid by Bright, In
gram & Fox, of Danville to J. C. Mc
Donald, of West Fork, Tenn., for an
extra choice mare mule, about seven
years old.
The stock pens were loaded to
their capacity, close on to 2,000 head
being weighed up during the day.
Some steers of extra good feeding
quality were among the offerings, be
ing brought down by the Tennessee
bovs who are regulars on the market
in Stanford. Top prices for feeders
and sloppers were rom $6.75 to $7 a
hundred, mighty few reaching the
maximum figure, however. Medium
stuff and heifers sold around a nick
el a pound. Simon Weil, of Lexing
ton, bought a herd of 212 sloppers
during the day, from different par
ties, paying up to $6.75 for them.
There was considerable talk on
politics in the crowd during the day.
Interest in the presidential race is
increasing rapidly. The courtroom
was too small to accommodate the
crowd which gathered to hear Con
gressman Sherley, of Louisville, who
spoke on behalf of the Democratic
ticket. Considerable interest was
manifested in the secret straw vote
which was taken in the crowd on
Main street by the local correspond
ent of the Cincinnati Enquirer. The
result will not be known until it is
published in the Enquirer, as each
man's straw ballot was sealed by
himself and all were sent unopened
to the Enquirer at Cincinnati.
Merchants and business men of
Stanford report a very satisfactory
business during th2 day. The hard
rain which came up during the af
ternoon, made the farmers all feel
mighty good, and followed by a very
appreciable drop in temperature,
made a keen demand for heavier
apparel, which the merchants with
winter stocks on display, do not ob
ject to in the slightest.
LOCAL ELEVEN SMOTHERED.
The worst defeat the Stanford
football team has ever sustained was
administered to it Saturday when the
Eastern State Normal eleven wal
loped Stanford High 44 to 0. The
Normalites, however, outweighed the
local lads 25 to 30 pounds to the
man, and the defeat was not an in
glorious one by any means. Stan
ford made a hard, game fight, but
Normal was too big. This was the
first game of the season for Stan
ford, and she will do better later in
the season.

DESPONDENCY.
When you feel discouraged and
despondent do not give up but take a
dose of Chamberlain's Tablets and
you are almost certain to feel all
right within a day or two. Despon
dency is very often due to indiges
tion and biliousness, for which these
tablets are especially valuable. Ob
tainable everywhere.
