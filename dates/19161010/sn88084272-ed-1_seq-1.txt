Appreciates Herald Advertising
Chicago, IH, Oct. 7.
The Popular Dry Goods Co.. Inc., El Paso, Texas.
Your newspaper advertising is great. AVhenever the writer goes through
a bunch of clippings, to get an idea of the advertising our dealers are doing in
the territory under his direction, he always gets a peasant thrill and an in
spiration when he sees one of your full page advertisements.
The Popular page in the Week-End edition of "The Herald,'' dated Sept.
9 lu. is just about as attractive an advertisement as we have teen. The
'"heads" are fine, the display shows much care in the planning and the whole
thing is balanced perfectly.
You are to be congratulated. "The Herald" is to be congratulated, too.
because there can be no doubt bat what they render a very efficient service.
Without the co-operation of the newspaper, the advertising manager is cer
tainly handicapped. Yours very truly.

Foreign Relations.
Philadelphia. Pa . Oct. 10 Charles
K. Hughes vigorously attacked the i
policies of the Wilson administra- i
t:on in a speech delivered here Monday
night, declaring the Republican party
would not tolerate any improper Inter

Mr. Hughes's attack on the admnii

was couched in more vigorous terms
than any he has heretofore employed.

"The administration asks for a vote
of confidence," he said, "but its de

oaid, "we desire peace to be honora

tence on known rights, by deesrvlnc
and holding the esteem of the world.
We have not been kept out of war.
We have not enforced our rights: we
have sacrificed our honor.
Ignoble Personal War Waced.
Act after act b the administration
in its dealings with Mexico was cited
by the nominee to uphold his conten
tion that the countrv had not been
kept out of war. but that it had waged
"an ignoble personal war against
Huerta in the days of his power. John
I.tnd's alleged authorization to state
that Huerta would be "put out." the
occupation of Veracruz, the sending of
tbe punitive expedition Into Mexico
and the failure of the American troops
to utilize Mexican railways were points
upon wnicn nr. iiugnes touched.

"Has America forgotten Carrizal?"
he asked. "What was that peace or
war?"
"One brave officer." -the nominee
said he had been informed, "stricken
with pneumonia was competed to travel

rough roads in intense suffering and
died in the camp to which he was thus

"This followed the curt refusal by

war," Mr. Hughes repeated. "We have
had Intermittent peace without honor
