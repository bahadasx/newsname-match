The Seattle Star
: THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THAT DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS s
VOLUME 19.
WHY THE STAR IS FOR WILSON
The Star is for Woodrow Wilson.
Wilson has been president for three and a half
years. He has faced vital problems in international
affairs. He has given his country peace and
prosperity instead of the horrors of war.
Wilson has been a positive president. He has been a pro
gressive president. To his credit are such measures as the child
labor law, the income tax, the federal reserve act, the rural
credit bill, the shipping act, the Alaska railroad bill, and last,
the eight-hourlaw, which prevented a paralyzing railroad strike.
Charles Evan* Hughe* hat been before the country as a candidate for four
months.
We have watched Mr. Hughes closely. We have studied him and his
friends. We have read his speeches and we have heard him talk.
And this fact stands out —HUGHES OFFERS NOTHING. He is without
an issue. The tenor of his whole campaign has been one of complaining de
structiveness. He finds fault with the president in general terms, but sug
gests no specific remedy. He criticises the president's policy, but he fails to
say what he would do under like circumstances.
As compared with the clear thinking, sure-going Wilson, Hughes is an un
known quantity—• negative.
It is needless to say, of course, that The Star is guided in this determina
tion by no partisan fetish. If Wilson, the president, happened to be a repub
lican and Hughes a democrat. The Star would be for Wilson, the republican,
just as it is for Sen. Poindexter, the republican, against George Turner, the
democrat.
THE QUALITY OF THE MEN, AND THE PRINCIPLES
FOR WHICH THEY STAND, ALONE DETERMINE THE
STAR'S POLICY WITH REGARD TO THEM.
Finally, we are for Wilson because in this time of great crises
in the world's affairs, there being no beaten paths to follow, he
sets his course by the stars and is unafraid.

In opening the eaao Monday,

He declared the state would at

that Haliiulsl ran across the lobby,
and that Hohhl followed with gun
leveled; that witnesses Interceded

Hull. He aald that after the shot j

AMBASSADOR COMES
FOR REST; LANSING
MAKES SUGGESTION
I.O.N'C, BRANCH, Oct. 10.— Ambassador Gerard, who ar
med in New York tins morning, hears no message from
Kaiser Wilhelm to l'rcsidenj Wijson suggesting American in
tercession in behalf of peace.
\<>r di>es he come for the special purpose of discussing
reported revival of the submarine menace. It may be stated
poitivelv Gerard's trip to this country is made entirely at the
suggestion of Secretary of State Lansing in order to give to
the American ambassador "a much-needed vacation."
A* a matter of fact, thl* Invlta
• tlon to come home did not reach
Gerard until shortly before his ship
t sailed Me was In Copenhagen at
the time making preparations for
Mrs. Gerard'* trip back to thl*
country.
There Ik no doubt, of course, that
the president will want to know all
developments both regarding the
feasibilities of peace In the near
future, and regarding any prepara
tion* which nißy be under way In
Hermany to resume I'-boat prac
tices objectionable to the t'nlted
! State*.

GERARD REFUSES TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS
NEW YORK. Oct. 10— He
turning from Berlin on board
the steamer Frederick VIII.,
American Ambassador James
W. Gerard today refused to an
swer any question relative to
the purpose of his vieit to
America at this time, saying
that even th* simplest ques
tion "might Involve" him.
"I* It true that you are
bringing a peace message from
the kaiser to President Wil
son?" he was asked.
"I cannot answer that ques
tion," h* replied. "To reply to
any question of that nature
might Involve me."
The ambassador's attention was
railed to an article wirelessed from
the Frederick VIII. to a New York
paper, declaring positively that he
brought no peace message, but
came to warn President Wilson
that Germany was preparing to re
sume indiscriminate submarine
warfare. He was asked if tills was
a correct statement.
ONLY 5 SHIPS SUNK
BY DIVER IS BELIEF
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.—Be
lief that only five ships were
sunk In the German subma-
rine raid off Nantucket grew
in shipping circles here today
as vague and contradictory re
ports concerning the crew of
the Kingston were received.
Thirty-six hours having elapsed
since tile Kingston was supiiosed
to have been sunk without any
trace of her crew, steamship men
were Inclined to believe the name
of the vessel may have been mis
read by wireless operators and that
no such vessel as the Kingston was
attackf d.
Within the last 12 hours an argu
ment has arisen as to whether the
name of the ship supposed to Ijave
been sunk was the Kingston or
Klngstonlan. ('apt. K. U Yates, of
the Uruguayan steamer I'. L, M.
No. 4. which rescued Ihe crew of
the British S. S. Strathdene, said
he believe I the name of the Chris
Man Knudsen had been misread
"Kingston" in some way when re
ports were transmitted by wireless.
It w is also pointed out that all
of the -learners were sunk with
in a comparatively small radius.
The crews ol the five ships known
to have gene down were easily and
speedily found by V. S. destroyers,
lu view of the care the Cierman
BUbnurine was evidently taking to
conform to all requirements of In
ternational law in giving the crew*
ample time to take to their small
bo its. It is ulso pointed out that It
hardly sernis reasonable that the
crow of one ship could possibly be
overlooked by the rescue wunships.

The president is to make a strong

boat. There the ambassador, for 15
minutes, smilingly parried questions
from interviewers, fired at him in
volleys.
Seventeen destrojers wore In
the waters off Nantucket Light at
one time, and if a ship named thv
Kingston was sunk, some trace i>f
her crew or wreckage of some sort
