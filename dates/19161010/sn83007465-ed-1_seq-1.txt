COTTON CROP SHORTAGE
Valuable Information Concerning
Seed Corn for Next Year.
Roll Weevil Coming.
The ginners report for Lancaster j
county published in the last issue of
The Ufews, furnished by Mr. L. M.
Beckham of Pleasant Hill, in which
It Is shown that the bales of cotton
ginned this season are 2.100 short of |
last season, is convincing proof
of the cotton shortage in Lan-j
furnish considerable food for
thought to those who are interested
In the future welfare of our county.
In addition to the above we must
further consider the fact that, in all
probability, the dreaded boll weevil I
will reach this county during the next
two years, therefore, we should not
delay longer in beginning our preparations
with which to meet this
new foe. Those who have not witnessed
the dreadful ravage of thei
bolj weevil cannot begin to realize
what our farmers are up against
when it does arrive. Therefore, to
he prepared for the coming of this!
pest, we should get busy on crop rotation,
cover crops, small grains,
crimson clover, corn and stock raising.
Get in touch with the local
county agent, Mr. C. L. McManus,
and have him advise with you as to |
the proper line of procedure.
In discussing the possibilities of
corn raising for instance we can
truthfully state that a better county
than Lancaster for this purpose can
hardly be found In the State. Lancaster
county has fields of corn this
year that are excellent from every
standpoint. There are a great many
more that are only medium and too
many that are almost worthless. In
tome cases the farmer is whollv re
sponsible for the big yield; in others
the big yield has come in spite of tinfarmer.
In some eases the farmer is i
wholly responsible for the low yield:
and again in other circumstances I
over which the grower has no control
are to blame. The business of the
man who intends to grow corn next
year is so to act that no one can say
he is to blame for the failure. When
a crop does not meet our expectations i
learn the cause if possible and over-j
come the difficulty.
Now is the time to start the 1 ! 17
corn crop. Some time ago we pub- ,
lished an article in this paper calling
your attention to the matter of proped
seed corn selection. It is to he
hoped that every corn grower has se-j
lected some corn from the field. The
question "How can this corn best be
kept until planting season?" is the
one to be answered now. When seed
corn is taken from the field it should
be^~basked at once and placed in a
dry place where there is a free circulation
of air. The ears should be
so placed that they will not touch
each other. Corn must not be allowed
to freeze while drying, for that
rason a well protected place must be
selected in which to keep during the
winter. The amount of cold corn
can stand and still grow depends up-i
on the percent of moisture present.
After the corn has dried as thoroughly
as nossible store in a drv nlace
where the temperature it* reasonably
constant and not too cold.
In connection with seed corn discussion
a few facts should be stated;
seed corn selected from standing corn
in the field will yield a great deal
more per acre than seed corn picked
at the time of husking. A farmer's
time is worth $2.50 per hour when
intelligently devoted to selecting and
testing seed corn. Try it two years
and you will say that the estimate is
low. Is your time worth more at
any other farm labor?
The drop in the price of potash
makes the fertilizer outlook for the
future hopeful. As yet potash prices
are prohibitive. The price according;
to the presid?mt of the Armour Per
tllizer Work has dropped from $500
f>er ton for Muriate of potash to
$290. Fortunately America is not
wholly dependent upon Germany for
ipotash. According to the same au
thirlty the Armour alunite project in
Utah, which has been developed
icue the war is now snipping a curled
a day.
Farmers and others are looking
forward to more leisure during the

Market?Road Work Progressing?Many

van wycK, uci. iu.?uur weatner
prohphets who predicted killing
frost early in October, say they are in
error, that the present moon is too
far south for an early frost. Some
ot our farmers, thought they were
right about the early frost and
mowed their late peavities, and cut
ofT their late corn before it was ready
'to be harvested and thereby lost a
good percent of the value of these
| crops. We were our own prophet
land let our late crops grow on. and
will be well repaid in the increased
yield.
Cotton pickers are keeping right
up with the open cotton, and this is
being ginned and sold as fast as
gathered as the price is good.
We see the News is boosting Iaincaster's
cotton market. This is
right. On October the second we
were in Lancaster and the price of
cotton was booming?16 1-2 cents
and over. We had a little cotton
ready for market, so hired a man to
drive a team and loaded up our cotton
on Tuesday morning, expecting a
! fancy price from the Lancaster market,
but to our surprise, we were
[barely offered 16 cents, and finally
sold to the new cotton buyer of Lancaster,
Mr. Ahrens at 16 1-16. We
were offered 16 1-4 for the cotton at
[Van Wyck that morning before it was
I loaded on the wagon and by 12
] o'clock could have sold at 16 3-8
without moving it. So in posting up
l our books we had to place on the
, debit side of the ledger the price of
!our man, the worth of the team's
'hauling and few dollar's loss in the
I price between Van Wyck market and
'Lancaster market.
Other markets on October 3rd
j were 16 1-2 and over. Our conclu
sion of the matter was, that the Laniraster
market on the 2nd day of October
was on a boom and on the 3rd
must have been on a bad slump, or
that we did not Ret a fair deal, and
that no more of our cotton would go
| to Lancaster, unless we knew what.
I we would Ret for it before we delivered
the Roods.
We do not mean to knock Lancaster.
We like the town, like her people,
tier banks, her merchants and
her citizenship. Hut facts and figures
are stubborn thiiiRs and hard to Ret
a round.
Mr. It. S. Howard. District Superintendent
of l". S. Flood Relief, visited
Van Wyck to learn something of
th flood situation in our community.
We had a pleasant interview with
him and learned a good deal of what
'is being done in many of the flooded
districts. He seemed somewhat sur'
prized that the Supervisor of bancaster
county had not made any application
for some of the relief funds,
iwhich this county was entitled to. He
spoke very highly of Supervisor Hoyd
! of York county, and told how Mr.
Hoyd took hold of the matter and
[how well he distributed the work In
the flood districts of York?convenient
to the flood sufferers and the
great amount of good work he had
accomplished and the relief he had
given to the many sufferers.
He said other counties had done
well but he thought York county had
nliahnrl nw?u? I
*... ...wo., hi- npune nigniy
of the good work done on Ihe streets
of Lancaster, but thought the money
ought to have been better distributed
among the flooded districts, but no
I one had made a request except the
mayor of Lancaster. And my request
tot a more equitable distribution. He
assigned $:t00 for road work in Van
, Wyck community. Van Wyck will
soon organize a crew and get some of
the relief fund.
