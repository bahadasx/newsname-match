WASHINGTON, October 10 At least one of the steamers sunk
in Sunday's wholesale raid against shipping. by a German
submarine off Rhode Island was sent to her end without vrarning
. and thirfact, coupled with the announcement that Secretary of State
' Lansing' ha$ been summoned to Long Branch to confer with the
, President, lends weight to the apprehension in 'official circles that
complications are probable. V. f ' ' i. ' . .

' Secretary of the Navy Daniels, In s

says that the facts as reported, to his

various destroyers " despatched to the
scene of the torpedoing on rescue work
do not show that there has been any
isolation of International law. None
of the work of the submarine was done
within tba three-mile limit. ,
'STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY'
t The President told newspaper men
gathered at ' Shadow Lawn yesterday
that Germany will: be) held to a strict
ulnlment of her promises to safe
guard neutral lives and property while
carrying on her submarine warfare.
The pledgee given by the German
government in notes to the United
Jjtatee, . following ' other . submarine
crises, will be met, the President a,
sored his questioners.
- Ho added ithat Is Is not right how to
anestlon Germany's . willingness to
4 carry out her. pledges, or to take for
. granted that' the sinking of vessels off
Nantacket Is In violation of her assur
ances. The government of the United
States, he said, will first get full tnfor
"' and possess Itself of every mev
: serial fact...
"The country may rest assured that
Qermany will be held to complete ful
filment of, her promises," said the
President.
' OTHBR COMPLICATIONS '

hero that there is possibility of com.

ments arising out of the submarine
, raid although the V-63 Aid not take on
any supplies during Its few hours' stop

PAHia, October. 10 Whilethe fight
ing in Transylvania ' and 1 Itfaeedonia
continued to hold tEe greatest amount
of interest yesterday, the British aorth
of tho Bomme made gains, drswiDg
nearer to Bapaume and thrusting a
iwedge deeper lato the Oerman lines,
threatening the Teutonic ealient which
extends southward between the Albert
Bapaume road and tho railroad run
ning north from Albert.
General von Maekepsen, commanding
the BiHgar-Germanie force ,, which is
opeaing against the Russians and Ru
manians ie the Dobrudja district, an
nouneed an important victory last
flight. Ilia .troopa surprised a Ru
manian garrison o one of the islands
in the Danube river, northwest of the
town of Hislova. . The entire garrison
fell into German hands, together with
six field gnns.
The official Berlin statement says
that the town.ef Toersburg was cap
tured by the Austrian and German
troops, and that the Rumanians in
Transylvania are 41 falling) back all
along their line." Bucharest officially
admits this retreat, and,-aeeording to
a despatch to tha Wireless Press Agency
at Rome, the movement out of Kron
stadt was made to "save the city from
destruction by the' Teutenle gnns."
In the struggle on the Galieian bat
tie-flelds the Russians are continuing
their hammering tactics, but, Berlin d
clares that they have been repulsed
wherever they attempted to advance.
Petrograd makes so claims of im
portant victory but declares that the
Hlavs have pierced the Teutonic lines
in some places sod have consolidated
the gains that they have made.
In Macedonia the struggle for Mon
astir continues, with the Brbs batter
ing sway against the . positions held
by the Bulgarians. They have been
successful to some extent, having cross
ed the Ceroa river and have taken the
tows of Hhocklvir by storm.
Holla, however, deniea this, and de
nlarfir that the attacks against the
Monastir positions have been allowed
to slacken, if they have not been
abandoned entirely.
On the Htruma river front, where the
British troops are fighting, the Allies
have - made small gains, occupying a
number of unimportant villages. Tho
British are reported to be making use
of their latest weapon, the ".tank" or
armored tractor, ip this section as well
as on the Homme ront. They are re
ported to be doing considerable execution.

BOSTON, October 10 Every eitua
tion in sport or other kind of Ac
tion was sent to the discard lit-re
yesterday when the Red Hox capt'ired
the second game in the world's s-tJos
by the narrow margin of two to , one
after fourteen innings of Hid kiirdeet
and most brilliunt baseball over J.layed
on any diamond. .
The stage setting wus perfect. More
than 41,000 wild and dishevelod faas
yelled themselves hoarse after packing
themselves Into the grandstand, the
bleachers and every available plaue in
the field where they would iiot interfere
with the play. For most of the time
they were on their feet and critics of
the national, game declare there i.asl
never been such a scene on ny lihse
ball field since the inauguration of the
great American classic. 1 1 ,'
One tenso situation followed another1.
There were no lulls. Back and f ji-th
the game went for fourteen long In
nings, with two young southpaw; who
had never pitched in a world's series
game before, working like veterans and
holding to' s few scattered hite the
giant sluggers of tho two premier
leagues.
Pinch Players Won
That victory finally rested with the
hi-me team is due to one of those sur
prises that has mado ham-ball the fas
cinating game it is. It was not only
the two errors of the Brooklyn team or
the seven hits of the Km! Hoi that won
the game, but it was the fact that a
pinch hitter who was sent to the bat
at the last moment made good, with a
long single eud a pinch runner who' was
on seoond was able to dash across the
home rubber slab after streaking around
third bane on a drivn that 'would have
advanced a less speedier player but
one base,
The sum total of the fourteen innings
is remarkable, It shows only thirteen
scattered hits for both teams,' three er
rors for the two aggregations and a
combined score of only three runs. An
analysis of the result shows that des
pite the heroic efforts made by the
Trolley. Dodgers, the Boston team Won
on consistent playing and consistent
batting. Of the thirteen hits they are
credited with seven with only one error
charged against their account. Fortu
nately the error was not costly, but
more fortunately still the hits , were
made, especially the long drive in the
fourteenth inning, when tn'ey'were sore
ly needed. . ' ,...
Praise For Losers
After the atruggie was over and the
mad crowds had vented their wild de
light by throwing everything imagin
able into the field, including a shower
of coins, the .defeated Brooklyn team
became almost ae great heroea as the
victorious Ked Ho players. ' Every
inch of the game was contested by the
boys from Brooklyn and praise and
cheers were showered on them as tbey
ran from the field after the winning
ran had, been scored. . Baseball fans
almost mobbed the automobiles that
took them back to their hotel. . But
it was a good matured mob, a mob that
could Hfford to. be generous to a gallant
ff Which had ajene down to detest in
;f1 tatf ( r wfcal we perhape the
preHtest world 's series game, ever play
ed. And the Trolley Dodgers' would not
i'.d mil rf-feat. They are confident that
they will yet wrest victory from the
Hub City and flaunt the world's cham
pion pennant over the National league
grounds on the eastern side of the
Brooklyn Bridge The Boston players
were loud In their praise of the Brook
lyn lenm and declared that the 'fight
ing Mpirit of the play "is was tvonder
ful. .
More Than Spectacular
To c:ill the game the most spectaeulur
contest ever played in e world's series
Is trite. It was more than that. It
was a battle of science, skill, clean
American fair play from the time the
first ball waa i pitched until McNally
flung himself across the home pluto
with the winning mot
Better pitching than the kind offered
world's series game before, but tbey
lived up to the brave traditions of tha
game and their names will figure Con
spicuously in all future histories of the
national game. The fielding waa like
clock work and the three errors re-pixteri-.l
in the fourteen innings played
little pint In the. final result. J V
Scott Particular Star
If hiiv honors were due to individual
players aside from the masterful work
of the opposing; pitchers, they muat go
to Kveret( Heott, whose . sensational
stop and throw in Saturday 's , game
prevented Brooklyn from tying the
score in the final in sing of that con
tent. Scott accepted every chance that
came to him and rolled up to his credit
two outs end seven assists besides
knocking opt two bits and scoring one
run. Hcott proved the Nemiais of the
Dodgers. whenever the National
Leaguers threatened to break Into the
score box Hcott was there with 'Sensa
tional stops and cannon ball throws
thr.t ended all run-cetting aspirations.
He simply robbed the Brooklyn iteam

As the jubilant fans walked around

drive from off Johnson's bat and fol
lowed this a moment later by handling
mho iignming a hard drive from
