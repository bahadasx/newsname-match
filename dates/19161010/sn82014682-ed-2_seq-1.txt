Oaubert Comes Back .
Jake Daubert, guardian of the Initial
sack, won his way into the good graces
of the Brooklyn fans tdday after a
lapse of about 72 hours. He played a
sensational game at first, secured
three hits - and scored the first run
of the day. Charley Shorten, who
played his first game of the series
lor Boston, was the hitting star of
the visitors, securing three singles, one
of which was responsible for a run.
Ivor .Olson was the real hero of the
day in : the hitting line. Wheat and
Mowrey had walked In the fifth, and
the Swede came to the plate with two
men on bases and two out He had
singled in the fourth and scored the
tecond run, and the crowd gave him
a great hand as he marched to the

to wildness, but he sent one across

placed in Imminent peril of their
lives today when a sudden burst
of flame ran through a. lower -f
hail of the main university build-

through the smoke of the stair-

the outer air safely. So far as is
known there was not a single ras-

The origin of the fire Is un-

has been lively fire and patrol activity.
The furious Sorome battle continues
today. Yesterday the Allies already
terrific efforts were materially in

Near Lesars a British hold was

tors south of the Somme.
Army Group of the Crown Prince:
Extensive German blastings in the Ar
gonnes have destroyed French trench
es to a considerable extent East of
the Meuse artillery combats have been
temporarily revived.
The extreme strain on all forces
has required extraordinary achieve
ments from our flyers as well aa from
the land forces, since they must take
part in constant observation service.
The heavy task of observation raiders
can only be accomplished if the . bat
tle-flyers hold off the enemy. The
number of air combats has therefore
reached record figures in the past few
days, with a favorable result for the
Germans. We lost during September
20 machines in air combats and one
is missing. The Anglo-French losses
in air cotmbata were 97; shot, down
from the earth, 25; 4 forced to land
in our lines, seven, a total of 129 ma
