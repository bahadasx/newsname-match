against Governor Whitman came as no

Philadelphiii, Oct. 9. Charles E.
Hughes started hia tinal Western cam?
paign to-night with a vigorous de
nunciation of the foreign policy of the
Wilaan Administration. His lifltflBfln
interpreted it in the light of the new

warfare, but the Republican nominee,
however, made no upecific reference to
thc l'-boat news. He served just a
plain notice upon Europe of his inten
tiflfl u" elected to enforce American
rights on land and aea unflinchingly
and without fear.
The abortive "strict accountability"
policy of President Wilson he brar.ded
as a humiliating failure to Kafeguard
American rights. He charged the Presi?
dent svith attempting to eseape de
?-?erved condemnation by trying to make
the public think the altcrnative of his
policy is war.
"We have not been kept out of war."
clared Mr. Hughes. "We have not en
forced our right-:. We l.ave sacrit'.ced
our honor. We have had intermittont
peace without honor and intermittent
war without honor."
The Admir.istration's Mexican policr,
Mr. Hughes asserted, s.Tiously iBt
paired the nation's purestige when the
European war Ftarted.
"Again," he said, "the Administra?
tion lamentably failed to perform thc
primary duty to sateguarii American
lives. The Administration was r.ot con
vincing. Its words were many but in
effect;4e, because lt was not bolieve.l
that they would be backed bf deed'."
F'romisea to Protect Right*.
"We propose to p.-oteet Ameii.an

tl'roia a S'atf Cafgata a 1
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 9?The
situation brOOght about by tho U*
boat raids off Nantucket has p-rave
possibilities. This was indicated to
night, when President Wilson sum
rnoned Secretary Lan.-ing from
Washington tor a conference here to
morrow.
Karlier in the day the President
had announced that (iermany would
ba bii'I tu "complete fultilment of iti
pronii.>e.-." Then came a conference
with Coonl von Monistorff, the Gei
man Amba-.-aiior. who had no offi?
cial advice.- from Berlin, but said ho
had every rea.-nn to believe that (Jer
I many v.ould "live up to her promises
| in the future as ihe had in the past."
Rlockade Holds Dangrr.
The danj'er in the situation does
not lie in the fact that a sinfle sub
l marine _____ -ix or more vessels ofF
I the Ameriean coast. It lie.- in tho
j poaaibility that the one raid muy be
: the forerunner of more, and that the
I'-I.uats may cstallish wh'.t i.s prac
I tically a blockade ot' the Ameriean
| ports.
There is nothing in the report.* re
[ceived by Administration offieiais so
far to indicate that the Gennan com?
mander \iolat<*d Berlin'a pledpes.
, The concern felt in oAcial quarter
here is over what miirht happen if
thfl raids are eontinued.
That the Preaident appreciutes the
seriousness of the litaatiOB is iriii
from the fact that he Immedi
a'.elj got into connnunication arith Sec

Navy officers say their preparat.ona
are more for developments rather than
any immediate emergency. The Ger?

Nantucket. Shoals, it was 3aid, have
shown no disposition thus far to vio

v. iflh to be ready to establish the patrol
without delay.
Secretary Daniels 'gave high prais*
to-day to the Atlantic destroyer flotilla
v.ing the lives of those compe'led
to take to the small boats yesterday.
A record for quick action probably wa'
establi*hed when the destroyer Jarvis
put to sea from Newport within iifty
six minutes after the SGS call from
the torpedoed stearner West Point wa
recived. Fifteen minutes later six?
teen other destroyers had followed the

Secretary Daniels mad. it plain that
the only immediate interest of the
Navy Department had been to do every
thing within its powe. to prevent lo?

as the policy of the government in
regard to the submarine operations in
progress of the Atlantic Coaat at least
until ?uch time as developments ahall
