Her Story of Killing of jim
mie Culwell on Sep
tember 30th.
Lyman Lucas has been indicted for
murder in killing Jimmic Culwell on
the night of September 30.
Mrs. Mary L. Lucas will be the chief
witness against Lucas. Her story is,
that she was living apart from Lucas

on her own farm and that Culwell
lived with his father within 200 yards
of her house.
She says she and Culwell both
clerked for S. Klein on show day and
that she and the young man and her
son, Stanley E. Ward, aged 13, went
home in her buggy and after she had
gotten supper and the boy had gone
to bed in an adjoining room that she
and Culwell, who had stayed to sup
per, were sitting on opposite sides of
the fireplace when Lucas pushed open
the door and crabbed her by the
shoulder and with an oath shot at her,
missing her. She jerked loose and
attempted to reach for her pistol on a
table and he shot at her three times
more, one shot grazing1 her dress and
knocking a pin off her clothing. . An
other povder-burned her neckwLu
cas then turned and shot Culwell dead
as he tried to rise from the chair he
sat in.
She says her son will corroborate
her story, except as to the actual
shooting, which occurred while he
was In the adjoining room.
