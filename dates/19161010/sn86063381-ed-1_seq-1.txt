the series by a score of 4 to 3.
Brooklyn played errorless ball.
The summary:
R. H. E.
Boston 3 7 1
Brooklyn 4 10 0
The Dodgers jumped into the con
flict this afternoon confident and de
termined to win. They apparently
cared nothing of the fact that the
Red Sox had taken the first two
and appeared determined to
cop this afternoon's game or die in
the attempt. Coombs was on the
mound for the Dodgers with Miller
behind the bat. Mays and Thomas
I composed the Boston battery.
Much Enthusiasm.
For the first time during the
series the crowd showed much en
thusiasm. The bleachers and grand
Vfetand seats were filled early. The
sun shone bright and the air was
snappy but comfortable. The band
played "Tessie" and the crowd was
nqisy.
Although ticket scalpers had the
crowds at mercy in Boston, hardly
a ticket fell into any hands except
fans here today.
Both teams showed worlds of speed
in the final moments of practice.
Scores in Third.
Brooklyn took the lead on Boston
v\ in the third inning when it scored on
three hits. It scored again in the
fourth inning on two hits. With a
lead of two the crowd became noisy
and very much Brooklyn money was
flashed.
In the fifth inning the Dodgers se
cured two more runs.
Boston got its first scores of the
game in the sixth inning when two
scores were secured on two hits. Fos
ter replaced Mays when he was der
ricked. Mays had been nicked for
four runs and seven hits in five in
.nings.
In the seventh inning Coombs for
Brooklyn, realizing that he was weak
ening, called out Pfeffer to pitch for
him after Gardner made a home run
for Boston. Three runs and seven
hits were made off Coombs.
Neither side scored in the eighth
inning.
Boston failed to score in the ninth
inning.
First inningBoston, no runs, no

ducted by Mrs. Gosslin of Gemmell
late yesterday. He took a woman's
pocketbook from his pocket, opened
it and showed that he had only 26
cents and he asked that he be given
something to eat.
He was dressed in a dark suit* wore
a dark hat and wore button shoes.
His pants were fringed at the bottom
as if he had been walking through
brush and the heels of his shoes
were turned as if he had been walk
ing in a swamp. He was dirty and
showed signs of hard travel.

As he left the hotel Mrs. Gosslin
called J. A. McDonald of Bemidji,
state land examiner, who was in the
hotel at the time and told him that
she thought the man answered the
description of the man who assaulted
Miss Dahl.
Mr. McDonald then followed the
man and placed him under arrest.
On searching him he found a 22.
caliber revolver and a number of
cartridges. He also found many"
clippings of poems and a large num
ber of pictures of women clipped
from newspapers.

that he had been carrying newspa
pers there. He said that he left that
city Oct. 7 and he did not remember
anything after that until he reached
International Falls. He stated that
he then walked back to Bemidji. He
denied any connection with the Dahl
case.
Mr. McDonald turned his prisoner
over to Constable Brown who brought
him to this city.
