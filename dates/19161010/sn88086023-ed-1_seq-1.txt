Y ears Ago.
NEW YORK. Oct. 10. The Divine

.Miss Villa Mllholland, and her
press
representative. Abby Scott Baker. As
they stepped from the train thev were
met by Agent T. F. O'Brien who pre
sented them to the little group gath
ered. They Inquired eagerly as to the
situation here nnd were told by re
publicans that they were satisfied with
the Hughes outlook. One of the re
publicans added that the Wilson con
tingent also appeared satisfied.
Talking to representatives of the
press Mrs. Bolssevaln said:
"The democratic party Is the only
party which opposes the national po.
lltlcal freedom of women. The wom
an's party Is throwing Its entire
strength against President Wilson nnd
the democratic, nntionnl candidates In
the 12 woman suffrage states. The
woman's party takes no part in state
and municipal elections nor In the el
ections in the states where women
do not vote."

QUEEN MURIEL IS WED,
ROUND-UP RULER IS NOW
MRS. FRANK E. CRONAN
And they lived happily ever aft
erward."
That is all that remain to be writ
ten of the romance of Miss Muriel
Baling, twice queen of the Pendleton
Round-Up, Queen of the Portland
Rose Festival, Queen of the Columbia:
Highway and Queen of the Astoria
Regatta, who last evening became
Mr. Frank E. Cronan, all because she
has been so very much a queen.
Quite without the Knowledge of
family or friends she was quietly mar.
ried last evening at Heppner to a
young lone banker who had first seen
hed when she ruled over Rosarla, who
j first met her when she was queen of
tho Round-Up and who had wooed
I her ever since with an Impetuosity
that would not be denied.
The young husband of the festival
queen is a brother of J. E. Cronan of
! Portland, who acted as admiral of
; the Astoria Regatta over which the
j Pendleton girl ruled. It was this clr-
evenlnS at Happy Canyon. Apparent-
ly it was a case of mutual love at first
sight. During the remainder of the
Round-Up there was none so atten
tive to the fair ruler as the lone
courtier, and, after he had returned
home, he overcame the handicap of
distance by means of the automobile
and the telephone.
Sunday morning Miss Sallng left
Pendleton In the Dan Smythe auto
with a party of friends for Heppner.

NEWPORT. Oct. 10. Eleven
American destroyers steaming five
mile apart, swept the Atlantic off
Nantucket hunting the Kingston's

I The presence of an unusual num
ber of Chinese sailors along the wa

j A forty-mile gale and dark, cold
weather rendered the search most dif
ficult. Tugs which usually make
daily trips hunting the submarine lire
men failed to leave port.
Only Five Ships Destroyed.
It is now believed the submarine
sank only five ships. All were de
stroyed within a comparatively small
radius. American destroyers imme
diately saved the crews of the five
ships.
It is generally believed thai wire

dentified ships destroyed were un
true and the name ot the bessels
were never learned
The submarines have vanished.
No wireless calls came from the sea.
The Nantucket wireless reported "all
keys silent." Nothing was heard
from the French-Canadian liner,
Great City, carrying munitions and
bound for France. She was In the
dancer zone last night.
Shipping circles believe the subma
rine is lying quietly off Boston, wait

two thousand horses for the allies.

SUNK BY GERMAN U-BOATS.
SI CREW NOT LOCATED
They were met on the way by young
Crcnan. who accompanied them back.
He had already secured a license and
made other preparations for a wed
ding. The time and the place had
been arranged and all that remained
was to overcome certain objection ot
the girl to such an abrupt culmina
tion of their romance. In the end he
prevailed and last evening at 7:30 at
St. Patrick's rectory, Heppner, he
claimed her as hi bride, Rev. Father
P. J. O'Rourke performing the cere
mony. Only a few friends were wit
nesses. Immediately after the ceremony
the new was broken to the bride'
parent in thi city over the tele
phone, and the young couple follow
ed up their message by auto to re
ceive the parental blessing.
The new of their wedding spread
over the city thiB morning, occasion
ing a mild sensation because of the
unexpectedness of it, and the bridal
couple have been showered with con
gratulations all day.
They expect to make their future
home in lone where Mr. Cronan ha

father, Joseph E. Cronan, a prominent
Portland resident. The bride may re.
main here for a time to, assist her
father, County Clern Frank Sallng.

deputy. They plan to take a honey,

Cronan has a sister.
They are now stopping at the Hotel

Mr. Graham said:
"Ex-President Roosevelt,
in his
Battle Creek speech, stated in connec
tion with the anthracite coal strike,
that he had arranged and instructed
the general in command of the army
lo go there, if he so ordered, and take
control of the properties and act as
receiver. This would have been a
grosi usurpation of executive author!,
ty and a violation of the laws of the
country, as only the courts have the
right to appoint receivers, after a.
hearing.
"In this same speech, he stated
that after the sinking of the Lusitan.
ia, he would have seized all of the
cerman snips in our pons. Observe
first, that there were three men-of-war
in our ports. To have seized
these ships would have been a dec
laration of war and Germany wouid
have replied to it with a declaration
of war. Also, to have seized the nri.
vately owned ships would have been I
a violation of international law, be-
cause we were at peace with Ger-
many, it would have been a usurpa-'
tion of executive authority and Hle-

he would have seized these ships ot

NEW YORK, Oct 10. -Ambassador
Gerard has arrived from Berlin
aboard the Frederick Eighth. Ha re
fuses to answer any important ques
tions. He declared even the simplest
reply might involve him.
"Is it true you're bringing a peace
message from the katser?"
"I cannot answer. Any question ot
that nature might involve me."
"It's been reported you'll not re
turn to Germany."
"I am not sure when I'll return,
but it Is certain I shall go back."
Asked when he expected to see the
president, he replied: "That's up to
Wilson." He said he first learned of
the submarine activities Sunday night.
The steamer's wireleis received the re
ports., The Frederick passed large
field of floating oil several times.
A delegation of New York officials.
Including Collector of Port Malone,
went down in a police boat to wel
eome Gerard. A revenue cutter car
rying newspapermen also, met th
steamer down the bay. A, cold wind
swept the water. Despite the breeze,
Gerard and his wife went on deck
and posed for the movies and news
paper photographers. Thirty automo
biles at the dock welcomed Gerard.
Act'ng Mayor Dowling welcomed Ge
rard at the city hall and gave him the

The ambassador was visibly affect

; "Your countrymen feel the greatest
