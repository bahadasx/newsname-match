RIKER ABSOLVED
FROM BLAME IN
AUTO FATALITY
Coroner Phelan Hobis Young
Motorist Isn't Culpable,
v . After Hearing
Andrew L. Riker, Jr.; 18 year son
of Andrew L. Riker, vice-president of
th'e Locomobile Co., and member' of
the Naval Advisory board, this morn
ing was exonerated of blame for the
death of Frank Schremmer, who was
struck by Riker' s automobile, Sept. 23.
The coroner said he could find no evi
dence of criminal negligence on the
part of the young motorist.
The finding stated that Schremmer
started to cross at Fairfield avenue'
and Brewjjter street as Riker's car was
approaching. " The ' driver sounded
the horn and Schremmer turned but,
thinking he could heat the car, hur
ried on his way across the street. He
was , struck ( by the . mudguard and
fatally Injured. Riker swore he re
duced speed to 15 miles an hour as
soon as he saw Schremmer.
The- coroner declared he didn't
think - the accident could have been
averted, even if 'the speed had beet
less. ' Although young Riker had no
driver's license, this has no legal bear
inoMn the question of his negligence
since the courts have held that the
question of .a license has no bearing
on the responsibility for an acci
dent: -i - .
In the city court Riker was held in
bonds of $1,000 for the criminal su

Jointly obtained the services of Josepn

pinched.
X The scene opens at 652 State street,
about 10:30 last night. Enter the de
tectives. Worming. their way through
the front, door quietlvSand noiselessly,
they divest themselves of their shoes
and quietly creep up the front stairs.
Candle in hand they pass the door
of the room, where the two sisters ajre
sleeping, ' reach the attic and hide be
hind : the ' chimney. Fifteen minutes
later, the hero, a boarder at the
house, Phillip Vinka, blithely w-histUng
the "End of a Perfect Day," Ignorant
of the presence of the sleuths, enters
his room In the attic. Hife gaze Tv-an,-ders
to the' chimney, the dim ghostly
rays of the candle startle him and he
boldly saunters to the smoke funnel.
"Shish," whispers one detective;
"Curses, we're discovered, '' laments the
other, between cUnched teeth, as the
hero drags them, each with their shoes
in hand, from behind the chimney.
:"What do you want here?" boldly
interrogates the hero, while Walkotz
answers, "None of you business."
Harsh words foilow, the hero gets a
toe hold, they struggle and the scene
rapidly mounts to the, crisis.
' Freed from the embrace of Mor
pheus by the noise, the sisters arise.
Gertrude Leaby opens her room door,
runs, into the hallway In time to see
Levenson running to make his escape.
She grabs ; hold of him when he
makes a move as though to strike
her. i"Would you strike a woman?"
"No," Levenson simply breaks loose
and takes the stairs eight steps at a
time. n - ' .
Into the middle of State street the
discovered sleuths rush, hero in pur,

the participants. Now enter the po

"Converted" Him
T Trim n t- 51 I rummincra nf RtamfnrA
States Senator from" Connecticut, be-'
gan on Monday his whirlwind cam
paign among the small towns of the
state, and the first day's trip was rlcA
with interesting experiences, and
marked by cortlial 'greetings and en
thusiasms everywhere. '.
Starting from, Rockville Monday
morning, Jhe first day's trip took ii
the towns or villages of Somers, Som
ersville. West Stafford, West Wiiling
on, Tolland and Staffior Springs.
Mr. Cummings is making this cam
paign In an automobile. Half an hour
ahead of , him goes an advance car,
which draws up in the town square
where a speech is to be made. A bugle
is blown and announcement made of
the approach of the Cummings entour
age. Literature and campaign buttons
are distributed while the talk, is 'in
progress. i ' ' .
The opening speech of the auto-campaign
was made in the village of Som
ers, where a crowd pf 31 men a large
proportion Of the town's voters, had
gathered to listen. Opposite, on the
steps of the village store, a group of
eight or ten .stood apart. One of kh
Cummings party approached this
group and offered buttons and litera
ture. ' . : ' '. -' N
"Take it away or we'll throw it In
the street," was the cold retort. "We're
Republicans, we are."
Mr.. Cummings began his speech and
the crowd applauded. , One by one the
village store group drifted across the
street and into the audience. The en
thusiasm was infectious. At the end
pf the speech they joined in the ap
plause shook hands with Mr. Cum
mings every one of them and took
buttons and literature.
Meantime the advance car had gone
to Somersvllle where the principle
plant that of the Keeaey Woolen Mills,'
a tariff-protected industry. The owners
are strongly Republican so much so
that the watchman, or somebody con
nected with the, shop "sicked" a vic
ious bulldog on William FJnley, the
bugler. , X
wVle the handsome animal was
sparring to fix his teeth in Bugler
Finley's leg, Gen. George Ieeney,, pro
prietor ot the mils, arrived. ' He
promptly called off theT. "What's
it all about?" he asked.
, On being jtold that Homer Cum
mings was soon to speak he immedi
ately sent word through the shops that
every courtesy be extended to, the
speaker and ordered an extra recess of
10 minutes for thenoon hour, in order
to give his employes time to hear the
speech. i . . ' i
There are 50 employe's in the mills
and 200 by actual count stood for 20
minutes to hear the talk. The ap
plause was generous and the crowd
took buttons and literature.
West Willingtbn has about 28 voters
in the village. Twenty-three of these,
by actual count, were on hand to .re
ceive Mr. Cummings and listened at
tentively and appreciatively to his
talk.! West'Willington is the birth
filace of Jared Sparks, once president
of Harvard University, and author of
a life of George Washington.
In Tolland famed as the birth
place of a Democratic U. S. senator,
the late William O. Eaton, St per
sons were on hand- for Mr. Cummings
address and gave him hearty and
spontaneous applause. Tolland is
Democratic in complexion noVmally
and the assurances on every hand
were that Jt would give President
Wilson, Mr. Cummings and the whole
ticket a good majority this election
day. .
At West Stafford Mr. Cummings
was given a taste of TollamT county
humor. After his speech he was
approached by a sprightly gentltman
of 65, with bushy gray whiskers, felt
hat, carrying an umbrella neatly bag
ged at the top with a woolen string.
He shook hands with Mr. Cummings.
"It seems to me I've met you some
where," said Mr. Cummings.
"You're right; I was there," was the
dry retort.
It then developed that he was Ed
ward" Dimock, a leading Progressive
of West Stafford, enjoying the addi
tional distinction of being author of
a poem entitled . "The Progressive
Plow." ' This year the Progressive
Plow la turning over the .soil for

Dimock. ' 1 W .
The tour for the day ended at Staf
f orT Springs, where the town hall was
crowded with an enthusiastic meet
ing, despite a storm which burst in
the late afternoon and continued
through the night. One of those pres
ent, a clergyman, introduced himself
as a Republican who had intended
before hearing Mr. Cummings' speech,
to vote for Hughes. '

Washington, Oct 10. The United States haa refused to ac
cept the contention of the entente allies urging that neutral!
deny the use of their harbors to all submarines, whether m(yv
chantmen or warships, Gounse llor Polk, of .the state depart
ment announced today.
The allied governments in a memorandum to neutrals
called attention to,"the grave danger incurred by neutral sub

submarines." Y t '
Counselor Polk announced the department's position but
refused to discus the reasons for it. The American reply will
not be made public, before the return of Secretary Lansing to-
Seer etaryx Lansing lefrhere
way to the summer White House
with President Wilso on the

Officials realize the unlimited possibilities for development
may result from the transfer of German undersea activities toj.
America's shores, but as yet these are entirely eventualities ofj '
destruction of American commerce, and crippling of American
export trade in a purely legal way rather than actual violations
of international law. i.
Gerard Home,
Is Sifeiit On
Peace Rumor
New ' York. Oct. 10 James W.
Gerard, American anibassador to Ger
many, upon his arrival here today de
clined " either to affirm or deny pub
lished reports that he was returning
to the United States on" a peace mis
sion on behalf of the Emperor of- Ger
many.-. n
Mr. Gerard'r attention was called to
a story which appeared' this pnornlng
in the New YoUl World1 to the effect
that his errand was to inform the ad
ministration' that a-resumption of sub
marine activity is being considered by
Germany in. a manner' which might
threaten German-American relations.
Mr. Gerard, after nuicki? glancing
through this story, ald:
"You don't see me quoted anywhere
in It, do you?" "
To fruestlons put to the- ambassador
by reporters who. met him ajt quaran
tine, ne repneur ,
- It is' useless to question me, boys,
I cannot say a word." .
"The length pf my stay here is not
yet determined,) neither have I made
any plans," he added.vx "I expect to go
to Washington but i' when I do not
know." -
The ' Scandlnavlan-Amerloan liner
Frederik VIIL, on which M. Gerard
arrived, was met at Quarantine by a
municipal police) boat, on which was
Mayor Mltchel's reception committee
headed by Oscar S. Straus. Mrs. Ger
ard,' who accompanied the ambassa
dor, 'was presented with a large" bou
quet of American Beauty voses as she
came aboard the police boat. ,
Mrs. Gerard has been credited with
taking a leading part in war relief in
Germany. sAaked as to this work, she
disclaimed any personal credit, saying
that all American women in Germany
have done "magnificent work."" Mr.
Gerard said In response to a question
that there are about 8,000 Americans
in Germany at this time, of whom
about 700 are, in Berlin.

While evidence was not given outthere ,
was intimation that the President nasi
received information necessitating!

The President had on his program, 1
today conferences with Secretary Lan-' ,

Lansing will not come until late thia , "
afternon and will take dinner with the '
President and remain at Shadow Lawn; . - .
over night Ambassador Jessurand
has,, a personal letter from Presidnfc
Poincare of France to Mr. Wilson orJ
Polish relief, but it was expected thai
the new German submarine activities"
would be discussed. ! " i
It was not believed that the Arnerl-
can government would take any im-j
mediate action on developments totj ' . )
date in the renewal of German sub-j
marine activities.but consideration
was given to the question of whetheri
attacks on merchantmen so near thej
'American coast do not constitute sa
virtual blockade of American ports.
James W. Gerard, ambassador tot.
Germany, who arrived In New TorJcl
today from Germany, Is not expeoted.
to see President Wilson until new
week. It was stated authoritatively:
here that Mr. Gerard does not come on
any peace mission, area- can nis mp
has no connection -with submarine:
warfare but that he Is simply on a va
cation.
President Wilson plans to leave
Shadow Lawn tomorrow afternoon fop,
Indianapolis, where he will speak!
twice on Thursday afternoon. The
fact that he had shown no Indication:
of cancelling the IndianapoHs engage

he does not consider the submarine
