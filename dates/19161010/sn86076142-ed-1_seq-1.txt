POSSIBILITY AMERICAN
COMMERCE WILL SUFFER
Goods Valued at One Hundred Million
Dollars Already Placed in
Bond in the East
NEW YORK, Oct. 10. Exporters
lay that the mbmarlne raid will re
mit in advance of insurance rates
on transatlantic transportation and
jlll check shipments from New York
to European ports. There was talk
of a revival of the railroad embargo,
but no action taken.
American Importers are partly pre
pared fur an interruption of trade,
It is learned. Anticipating the short
age of European goods, they placed
in bond on the Atlantic coast foreign
merchandise valued at one hundred
million dollars. They began to store
this supply soon after the outbreak
of the war.

according to reports of American
naval officers. Iteur Admiral Albert
Cleaves, commanding the torpedo

remarkably speedy rescue work, said
last night lUt tbe reports of all his
officers agree! that to tbe beat of

ments of the captain of the Nan
tucket lightship and of sailors of the
torpedoed vessels that more than one
submersible was concerned. The U
boat, he said, was very fast and
appeared to have been handled clev
erly. It was eay, he pointed out, for
her to dlsapear on one side of a ship
and then show up unexpecedly at
another spot.
Doubtless, he believed, she bad
submerged and reappeared often
enough to mislead any but a keen
professional observer and to create
the impression that more than one
sea terror was operating.
This opinion would seem to be
borne out by the statements of many
of the refugees that the submarine
had more business on hand than she
could take care of at once and was
obliged to request one steamer to
wait her turn while another was
being put out of commission. Lieu
tenant Commander Miller of the de
stroyer Ericsson, who witnessed tbe
destruction of the Stephano, said he
was positive that only one submarine
was in tbe vicinity at the time.

GERARD NOT

TALKATIVE
Br Associated Preaa.)
NEW YORK, Oct. 10. Gerard, the
American ambassador to Germany, on
his arrival today declined to either
confirm or deny published reports
that he was returning on a peace
mission In behalf of the German- em
peror. His attention was called to a
Htory in the New York World to the
effect that his errand was to inform
the administration that renewal of
submarine activity was considered by
Germany in a manner that might
threaten German-American relations.
Quickly glancing through it, he said:
"You don't see me quoted anywhere
in it, do you?" He declined in any
manner to discuss his mission to the
United States.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF WAR NEWS OF DAY
B7AMorlate4PrcM.il .
Apparently satisfied w j the record
of at least six boats' sui Sunday, or
possibly short of torped Fs, the Ger
u man submarine raids on teamers off
Nantucket were not con 8!iued yester
day. Meanwhile, howe'TOr, the opera
tions of the German v -ersea craft
so close to tbe American shore has
created a situation which President
Wilson and Secretary of State Lan
sing will discuss today at Shadow
Lawn, the president' summer home.
Already the president has announced
that Germany "will be held to the
complete fulfillment of Its promises
to the United States" concerning sub
marine warfare. 1
On the battle fronts in Europe,
Transylvania and Macedonia continue
for the moment the centers of great
est interest. According to Berlin, the
Rumanians In Transylvania are re
treating along the whole line. The
Teutonic al)es have recaptured the
town of Toersburg, 15 miles south
west of Kronstadt and within seven
miles of the Rumanian border. In
the Danube, north of Sistova, the
Germans have occupied an island,
taking six guns and making prisoners
of the Rumanian troops there.
Serbians in considerable force have
crossed the Cerna river in Serbia and
captured the town of Skochivir.

There was evidence that when he

For some time, according to men
