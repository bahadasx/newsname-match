GERARD HOME,

United States Ambassador to
Germany Refuses to Con
firm or Deny Anything
When Met at Pier.
International News Service:
XKW YORK, Oct. 10. liefusinff
to confirm or deny any of the re
ports published about his mission,
James W. Gerard, the Fnited (States
ambassador to Germany, arrived
here today on ' the Scandinavian
American liner Frederick VIII. The
ambassador was accompanied by
Mrs. Gerard.
"I won't say a word," declared
Mr. Gerard emphatically. when
questioned by reporters. "I refuse
to confirm or deny anything."
Mr. Gerartl declared emphatically
that he would return to Germany,
say in it:
"I am just as sure that I will go
back as that I am standin here."
Pressed in particular about the
report that he is here to warn the
president of Germany's intention to
bCin a most drastic submarine war
fare, he retorted sharply:
Well, that didn't come from me,
did it?"
This was Mr. Gerard's tirst vaca
tion since the outbreak of the war.
Throughout the two years and more
of conflict he luus been UvinK in the
center of the Muroj-ean .maelstrom.
The Frederick VIII pas.sed the
new submarine warfare zone off the
New Fnuland coast without being
tnhmKe:ed in any way.
I aitliiislustic Grvctjnsr.
An enthusiastic preetin was
jriven the returning ambassador. A
committee, headed by Public Ser
vice Commissioner Oscar Straua
went down the bay to meet him.
Swarms of reporters besieged the
ambassador in the gray dawn as the
Frederick VIII slid into her moor
ings at (uarantine and later as he
was carried up the bay on the po
lice boat Patrol.
Was he coming with peace pro
posals from the kaiser for submis
sion to Pres't Wilson?
Was he bearing a message of
warning that Germany is to launch
a new submarine warfare more
ruthless than anythio.;,' ever known?
These and other piestions were
trained upon the diplomat, but to
all he was silent.
If, as has been reported, Mr.
Gerard was merely coming home for
rest and recreation after his ardu
ous labors in the war zone, he got
the welcome of a conquering hero.
All the way up the bay the police
boat was preete-1 with roaring
sirens end Hags thai were dipped in
salute. Fpon landing at the Pattcry
ther? was another demonstration.
Fomniitteo of Weli-oniO.
The committee of welcome was
composed of M members appointed
by th- mayor. Mayor Mitchel was
not Present in person, being absent
from the city, so New York was rep
resented officially by Acting Mayor
Dow ling.
The committee boarded the liner
and an impromptu reception was
held upon the deck.
Mr. Straus presented a huge bou
quet of American beauty roses to
Mrs. Gerard and made a short
speech of welcome.
The only i epresentative of th
rauernment present was Dudley
Field Mahme. collector of the port.
Some f the passengers of the
Frederick VIII who were gathered
en the dock said that a submarine
had been sighted from the deck of
the liner last Sunday.
Tb.e submersible was a long dis
tance off aiiu its nationality could
i.ot be ascertained, but those who
saw it thought it might have been
the F-" b
An American newspaper corre
spondent, who had accompanied Mr.
Gerard across on the Frederick VIII
had sent by wireless to his paper a
story saying that the real object of
tho ambassador's isit was to im
press Pres't Wilson personally with
the seriousness of the cloud hang
ing over German-American relation
as a r suit of submarine activities.
The correspondent also averred that
the ambassador brought no peac
proposals.
Mr. Gerard was told f this story
but refused absolutely to say a
word. His only answer was a
tightening of the lips.

a democratic victory on Nov. 7. The
republicans were a bit reticent in

the fact that the polls which were
