Notice by registered mail to Tobin
& Stevens, contractors on the lll-fam
ed Independence bridge, to resume
work on the bndge within ten days
was issued by the county court Fri
day afternoon. This order followed
meetings of the contractors) and coun
ty court Thursday and Fnday in In
dependence and Dallas. Following im"
mediately at the close of the meetings
the order is significant.
It is said that the contractors of
fered the county court use of their
equipment and their own superinten
dence in the repair of the bndge,
without cost. They showed their
teeth, however, by the presence of
their attorney, George W. Joseph of
Portland, in Independence Friday.
The written order entered on the
minutes of the county court is as fol
lows:
In the matter of the completion of
the concrete bridge on Main street in
Independence.
It is hereby ordered by the court
that the county clerk give notice to
Tobin & Stevens, contractors of said
bridge, to complete the construction
and repair of said bndge at once, ac
cording to plans and specifications
and that upon their failure to begin
work thereon within 10 days the court j
will take full charge of said work, I
holding cost of the same as a charge
against said contractors and that such
notice be given by registered mail.
A prominent Dallas lawyer gave
it as his opinion that it would neces
sitate a legal battle to obtain dam-!
ages from the contractors, if lezal ac-i
tion were started, and then a questior i
would arise as to collection. "I know i
one of the contractors: he has noth
ing. The other man I never heard of
until he took this work." It is evi
dent, too. that Tobin and Stevens
have said, in effect, 'take what we of-;
fer yon or fight.' That's evidently!
what the presence of their attorney
in Independence meant." j
W. O. W. to District Meeting. j
A large number of members of the
local W. O. W. lodge expect to go to
Salem tomorrow evening to attend a
district meeting and listen to address" j
es by rnpreme officers of the order.
A special train has been chartered j
from the Southern Pacific to take thej

Reports made by three or four cir
culators at a meeting of the Taxpay
ers' league Saturday afternoon indi
cated that the recall movement was
gaining influence and that, the Inde
pendence bridge failure was chiefly
responsible for the renewed interest.
Circulators say they are meeting with
more encouragement now than for
merly. This week it is planned to
have the petitions finished and in the
hands of the county clerk. Circula
tors will work in Dallas and Indepen
dence. The desire to have the peti
tions in this week is to enable the re
call to be voted upon at the general
election next month. The people in
terested in the recall say they do not
desire to put the county to the ex
pense of a special election.
Ed. Loose, who has circulated peti
tions in Spring Valley, Brush Col
lege and West Salem, said he had 150
names on his petitions. He believes
he will be able to secure 90 per cent
of the voters in these districts. A.
IL Dennett of Crowley reported senti
ment in his neighborhood was unani-'
mous. Mr. Krafts of DouglaB pre
cinct is reported to have 'phoned to
F. E. Meyers that every voter in
Douglas had signed the recall peti
tion he circulated. Mr. Oliver of Air
lie said he was experiencing little
difficulty in obtaining support to the
recall. Two circulators have promis
ed to work in McCoy this week ; two
in Dallas; and one in Independence.
J. K. Sears said to an Observer re
porter Saturday that he still retained
his interest in the recall movement
and that misinterpretation of The Ob"
server story of October 3 seemed ap
parent. At the meeting Saturday Mr.
Sears reversed himself somewhat on
his previous statement, that he would
not circulate the petitions, when he
promised the use of himself and auto
mobile to one circulator.
ASSOCIATION IS FORMED
WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IS TOPIC
OF MEETING. .
Gathering of Good Roads Men Here
Saturday Pledges for Perman
ent Road.
Season Closes Sunday.
Next Sunday evening, October 15,
at sundown, the open season for Chi
na pheasants in Oregon will close in
compliance with the recent order is
sued by the state game and fish com
mission. In sending out its official or
der to newspapers the commission
made error in marking the close of
the season as October 14 instead of
October 15, as was . intended. Cor
rections in the date, giving hunters
an extra day, will be published this
week.
Martini Are Improving.
Mr. and Mrs. John Martin, who
were hurt when their team ran away
near Derry last week, are both im
proving. Mr. Martin suffered a brok
en leg and Mrs. Martin was badly
bruised in the accident, and both
are still eonfined to their home. Drs.
Boll "-an and Staats are attending.
Witli the view that the country
west of the Willamette river shoul 1
be served with a good, permanent
highway the same as is proposed for
the East Side, fully 300 good roads
men gathered at the Dallas armorv
last Saturday night and organized the
West Side Pacific Highway associa
tion. These men, and a few women,
were from every center in the counties
of Yamhill, Polk and Benton and they
all came with the avowed intention
of showing that they could be depend
ed upon to do their part in seeing
that the West Side Pacific highway
would be given due consideration by
the state highway commission.
Judge R. C. Holman of the county
court of Multnomah county, who is
one of the leading good roads iren of
the west, gave the principal address
of the evening, explaining the intent
o? the association, and the bencfit-i
that would be derived from the suc
cessful execution of its work. He ex
plained that the West Side must have
an arterial road fromi the Multnomah
county line to Eugene, from county
seat to county seat and through tin
centers of population, with laterals or
feeders to less important points. The
building of such a road, he explained,
meant much in the development of
this part of the state, and all towns
must get together at the present, lay
aside petty jealousies, and work for
the road as a whole, deciding later
just what towns it would pass
through.
j)ther addresses were given by
Clairence Butts of Newberg, Oscar
Haj'ter of Dallas, J. D. Butler of
Monmouth, Judge Malone of Corval-
Hs, President Ackerman of the Mon
.month State Normal, Monmouth, who
.called attention to the - State-WSde
Tar " and Indebtedness limitation
Amendment, which if passed at the
November election will absolutely kill
any chances of getting the road in
the near future, Profs. Skelton and
McCullough of 0. A, C, I. L. Patter
son of Eola and Mayor Kirkpatnck
of Dallas.
C. C. Chapman, publisher of the
Oregon Voter, and a well-advised
road man, was to have been present
but sickness detained him. In Satur
day's issue of the "Voter" Mr. Chap
man expressed his deep regret at his
inability to attend a number of meet
ings in which he has been absorbingly
interested, among which was the We9t
Side Road meeting at Dallas.
Following the adoption of articles
of agreement R. J. Moore of Newberg
was elected president of the associa
tion and Win. T. Vinton of McMinn-
ville was elected secretary. The ar
ticles provide that the name of the as
sociation shall be the Wtest bide Pa
cific Highway association, officers of
which shall be president and secre-
tary, who shall be elected, and 20
viee-presidents who are to be appoint
ed by the president. Any person or
commercial club may become a mem
ber by subscribing his name to the
articles. The object of the associa
tion shall be the advancement of good
roads building and especially to en
deavor to build a highway on the west
side of the Wlillamette river. Ten
persons shall be a sufficient number
to constitute a quorum and the asso
ciation is empowered to name as many
standing committees as will be advan
tageous in locating and building the
highway. The articles were signed
by more than 250 persons.
President J. R. Craven of the Dal
las commercial club, acted as chair
man of the meeting, following which
sandwiches and coffee and cigars were
served.
Commercial clubs of Newberg, Mc
Minnville, Monmouth, Independence,
Corvalhs and Dallas were represented
by delegations at the meeting, a num
ber of farmers were present, and the
people of Dallas responded to the in
vitation to make a good showing at
the convention.

triui iMstor of McMinnville, will
preach for the first time in the Me
Minnville church, October 21. Mr.
Giffen has been in McMinnville the
part month bat ha been suffering
with influence. '
" Polk's crop of prunes is picked and
dried. With a big crop on their trees
growers four weeks ago prayed for
sunshine weather. Their prayer was
favorably heard. Sunshine weather
through the entire season enabled the
prune men to pick their crop without
loss and the sunshine caused the
fruit to sugar well: The crop has
dried heavy.
Most of the producers in Polk have
sold their crops at 6'2. A few got but
6V4. Early in the season several re
ceived 7. Some are now waiting for
the market to go to 6 or 7. Three
firms have purchased the majority of
the county's prunes, J. K. Armaby
packing company, Drager fruit com
pany and Mason, Ehrman company.
H. A. Woods has sold the 95 tons
of dried fruit from his 61-aore place
to Mason, Ehrman company for 6.
H. L. Crider has not sold the 40 tons
from his 3,300 trees. D. N. Kaegi dis
posed of his 60 tons to the Drager
fruit company at 6. R. L. Chapman
has not contracted for his 85 tons of
fruit. Dr. Mark Hayter's dried crop
of 65 tons belongs to J. K. Armsby
company for 62- Harry Butz will
receive a check irom A. u. feterson
of the J. K. Armsby packing com
pany for 40 tons of dried fruit at 6Vi.
K. B. Kugle has between 50 and 55
tons of fruit which he has not sold
yet.
The J. K. Armsby company' plant
is now working day and night pack
ing the 1916 crop. A crew of 85 is
employed to turn out the more tjian
4,000,000 pounds which this company
has contracted. The plant will run
under full head until about the first
of the year to handle this immense
quantity and it will require 100 ears
to ship the output to eastern, Cana
dian and European markets.
Pastor Is Changed.
Rev. F. W. Black, pastor of the Me'
Minnville Catholie church, has been
transferred to the Church of the
Blessed Sacrament in Portland by

Polk eounty reeeived the blue rib
bon premium for the best county dis
play at the Northwest Land Products
show in Seattle lost week. The dis
play was in charge of and arranged
by Mrs. Winnie Braden of this city.
It was in competition with counties
from all the northwest covering the
states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Montana and Alaska. Besides the
honor of getting first place, a neat
little cash sum of $400 went with the
award. Second place, with $200 cash,
went to Pierce county, Washington,
and third place, with $100 cash, went
to Morrow county, Oregon. Besides
these two high places, Oregon was
awarded another first prize, when
Leonard Gilkey, with a display from
Banner farm, Linn county, waB given
first award for the best individual
farm display, with $150 in cash. Out
of a possible 1000 points, the Polk
county booth scored 933. Gilkey on
his exhibit scored 863.
The show, which includes farm pro
duct displays from all the northwest,
covers an area of more than 70,000
square feet of space and is the great
est in scope since the Alaska-Yukon
Pacific exposition held in that city in
1909. The Alaskan display alone cov
ers more than five thousand square
feet, and the Oregon display includes
that of Polk, Linn, Wjasco, Baker,
Union and Morrow counties, besides
individual exhibits of fruits, vegeta
bles, grains and grasses. -
Five departments of falie state col
lege at Pullman, are represented on
the daily lecture programs, the United.
States forestry service has a big dis
play in the show, public schools have
garden exhibits and the machinery
displays provide life fend, action. The
Montana state exbibit ,an4 the Alaska
display are unique and attractive.
The show will continue until Ooto
ber 15. Thousands of persons are vis
iting it daily.
WILL SEE CANNING INDUSTRY.
Mrs.
Braden to Stop at Ohehalis on
Way Home.
Mrs. Winnie Braden, who has been
in Seattle since the close of the state
fair, and - where she arranged and
has charge of the prize winning Polk
county exhibit at the Northwest Land
Products show, expects to return to
Dallas about the 20th of this month.
Following the Seattle show she will
go to Ohehalis, where she will in
spect the plant of the Chehalm Can
nery company.. Mrs. Braden 's stopi
is at the request of the local
mercial club, and she will make
port of her findings to that body upon
her return to Dallas.
The local commercial club for the
past year has been looking into the
feasibility of establishing a cannery
here, and last spring W. V. Fuller
and F. J. Coad were sent to Cheha
lis to get data about that cannery. It
was considered a good plan to ask
Mrs. Braden to stop at the same plant
while she was in the north, and while
the plant was in full operation, so as
to have more complete figures. The
commercial club intends to arouse
more interest in the cannery matter
and every possible effort will be made
to secure one in the near future. It
is now planned to make it a co-operative
plant, by interesting fruit growv
era and farmers as well as business
men, and a suitable site has been of
fered for such a plant.
The matter of building a eannery
in connection with a cold storage
plant, which a local firm has in view,
was also suggested to the elub at its
regular meeting last Thursday night.
