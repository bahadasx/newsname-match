DEL GINER HERO
AS RED SOX IN
Poles Out Pinch Hit In Four
teenth, Making Score 2 to 1.
By DAMON RUNYON.
(International News Service.)
Boston. Mass.. Oct. g.-His name i Del
Gosner and tonight he in a hero. Bat
ting for Larry Gardner, in the fourteenth
inning of the second game of the current
world series, he polled out a Pinch hit
which enabled the Boston Red Box to
beat the Brooklyn Dodgers by the score
of 2 to 1.
For thirteen innings the teams had
battled through the longest game in the
history of world series competition, and
then when It seemed that darkness would
Intervene and put a- stop to the game.
Del Gatner stepped into the breach and
broke up the pastime.
Yet Brooklyn should have won. They
Uh Id have won by the xmr of 1 to 0.
B they lost. An unfortunate fumble
not an error-by George Cutshaw. the
Brooklyn second aese=am. in the third
Inning, paved the way for the run which
brought the Box on even terms with the
Dodgers.
In the first inning. HI Myers vlammed
Out a terrific home run. Off to an early
advantage the Dodgers should have won.
They have the reputation of winning
when out In the lead. But they lost,
though in losing again flashed a fight
which thrilled more than 41.000 baseball
Insects.
Fight StubborMly.
For more than two hours the teams
fought stubbornly and tenaciously and
whole-heartedly. From the third inning
to the fourteenth, they battled on even
terms.
Then with the stage set for a dramatic
climax, wih darkness coming on, Mr.
Gainer. the villian, appeared upon the
stage. Mr. Gainer Is quite an actor.
He looked over one strike and then swung
upon the ball and sent it to left field.
Zach Wheat scurried for the ball, pick
ed it up, threw it to the plate. But
Mike McNally, who had been put In to
run for Dick Hoblitsel, scampered across
the plate with the winning run.
Much could be said of this person
ainer. the villian. His first name is
,los. and it is said that his habits
are exemplary, though it is hard to
believe this of a person who would de
liberately ruin a perfectly good pas
time which, to all Intents and pur
poses. belonged to the Dodgers.
Might Call Him "Clouter."
He has a middle name, has this
Gainer. but a diligent search has failed
to reveal it. The initial. however, is C.
Just what the name itself Is we don't
know, but we suspect that it is
Clouter, or some such name as that.
HI. Myers, wf has acted like a per
fectly'gVespectabIe hero In the two
gan which have been plaed thus
far, drove a hose rm in t h4.og.ag
frame. and. with Sherrod Smith pIteb
ing wonderful ball. It seemed that the
Dodgere were going to return to
Brooklyn with a game to their credit.
Babe Ruth and Sheirod Smith were
the opposing pitchers. Until to4ay's
game neither had ever taken part in a
world series contest. Yet upon the
occasion of their joint debut they did
much to make baseball history. For,
never in the history of professional
baseball had a world series gone to
fourteen innings.
Should Have Been Enough.
That one run should have been enough
to hold the Red Sox safe. but they tied
the score in the third. The first man up,
Everett Scott, tripled to left. Thomas hit
to Cutshaw and Cutshaw made a very
cd play in holding Scott to third, and
then tossing out Thomas at first. Ruth,
who is a notable long-distance hitter, also
siashed at the first ball pitched to him
and hit a roller to Cutshaw. The Dodger
second baseman got the ball all right.
but then dropped it. Had he held it he
could easily have retired Scott at the
plate. As it was, he lost his chance of
getting Scott. so he tossed out Ruth at
nrst while Scott scored.
Before all this had occurred, however,
Sherrod Smith had mussed up an oppor
tunity for a run which would have en
abled the Dodgers to retain a margin
over the Box tally in the third. In the
Dodgers' side of that same inning, after
Otto Miller had been. thrown out by
Scott, Smith hit a terrific drive to right.
It was an easy two-bagger. but when he
reached second Smith decided to keep on
going.
Down on third base Jack Onombe,
wrapped up in a dingy old sweater, was
waving his hands and yelling s he tried
to make Smith stop at second, but Smith
was on his way. He slid into third only
to find the ball in the hands of Gardner.
The next man. Johnston, hit a long single
to center. Smith might have scored on
that.
Dodgers Make Deuble Play.
The Dodgers made their first double
play of the series in the fourth when
Hoblitsel walked after Smith had thrown
Out WaIker. Mowrey got Lewis' throw
and the runners were doubled up, Mowrey
to Cutshaw to Daubert.
In the eighth inning, which opened with
the band playing the National anthem
and everybody standing with heads bared.
MOwrey singled to left. Olsen sacrificed
him to second. Miller singled to center.
the ball going on a line. It was here
that Mowrey made a play which Is being
freely eriticised. He took a look at the
ball, instead of tearing out at top speed.
When he finally got going. Walker had
the hail and Coombe stopped Mike at
third. There was no chance of him scor
ing then, but many think he could have
scored If he hed moved with Miller's hIt.
Walker threw to the plate and MIller
took second on the throw. Smith hit to
Scott. and Mowrey, who was rushinf to

(By the internatimai wews service.)
Philadelphia. Pa., Oct. .-Charles
Evans Hughes definitely pledged himself
tonight, if elected, to tolerate no foreign
blacklisting of American traders and to
trtno interference with American
"We do not propose to tolerate any im
Proper Interference with American prop
erty. with American mals, or with oom
mercial intercourse," he declared.
"No American who is exercising Ameri
can rights shall be put on a blacklist by
any foreign nation. We propose to pro
tect American lives, American property.
and American trade according to our
rights under international law."
Mr. Hughes made no direct reference to
the newly developed submarine situation.
Earlier in the day he had authorised
a statement that be did not wish to em
barras the administratIon in dealing
with the new problem by publicly dis
cussing it. but he reiterated with unusual
emphasis his declaration for the "protec
tion of Anerican lives on land and on
sea."
"The admInIstration asks for a vote of
confdence." he said, "but Its defenders
cry out In protest when its record in
critically examined. When its humiliat
ing failure to safeguard American rights
Is held up to deserved condemnation it
tries to escape by aserting that Its con
duct has no alternative but war; that to
disprove its conduct is to favor war.
"This astounding assertion cannot
avert attention from the serious errors
committed. We all desire peace, but we
desire peace to be honorably maintained
by correct policies, by firm Insistence on
known rights, by deserving and holding
the esteem of the world. We have not
been kept out of war; we have not en
forced our rights; we have sacrificed our
honor."
