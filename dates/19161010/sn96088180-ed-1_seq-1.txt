FOR SURVIVORS
Newport, R. I., Oct. 10. Eleven
American destroyer, steaming in a
line with Ave miles of rolling ocean
'between them today, swept the At
lantic off Nantucket, where five or
six freighter were unk by a Ger
I man lubmarlne laat Sunday, in an.
other effort to, locate the crew of the
Kingston, or Kingetoalaii. - " ' "
I When Admiral Cleaves ordered the
i destroyers out at 9:20 today, he ad-
.mltted it would probably be a useless
j search, after the all-night gale and
I cold weather. v '
The combing process started near
i.Montauk Point, and awung eastward
I It covered a distance of 65 miles
I north and south and out beyond Nan
tucket shoals lightship. The Pauld
log was the first to get away, leaving
I four minutes after the order was re
ceived, and went steaming down New.
port harbor at a speed of 25 knots.
The sea was choppy, but the atmos-
phere clear, enabling each vessel to
see the next In line. The searcher
were, besides the Paulding, the Dray-
ton, Jenkins, Fanning, Jarvls, McCall,
jWadsworth. Nicholson, Walnwrlght,
Porter and Conyngham.
j The destroyer out laat night tall
ied to locate any survivors and Ad
Imlral Cleaves waa akeptlcal of the
j success of the new expedition.' He
planned, however, not to have them
jatay out longer than 24 hours, feel
ing that if such a ship as the King
ston waa sunk and the men are still
j alive, they certainly will be located
In that time. ."
