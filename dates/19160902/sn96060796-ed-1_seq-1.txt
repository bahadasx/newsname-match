Cochise, one of the banner de
mocratic counties of the state,
comes through with what they
claim is the lowest tax levy in
the state of Arizona. County
tax is placed at 43 and state tax
at 4U cents on eacn 5iuu valua
tion .
Summer rains in Cochise coun
ty were late this year, the first
ones coming between July lOatid
14. As a result, dry farm crops
will be late. A large acreage of
beans was put in as late as Aug
ust 1. Most of the early plant
ings of lrafir and sumacsorghum
are doing very well.
James A. Taylor, a printer,
known to his associates as '"Chip-,
py," and a paroled prisoner from
the Florence penitentiary releas
ed by the parole board, was ar
rested and placed in the county
jail late last Saturday night on
a charge of threatening the life
of Fred Cutler, foreman of the
Citizen. Taylor has been enjoy
ing parole from a long term sen
tence for murder.
The old Planet mine on Bill
Williams Fork that was in the
height of its prosperity in the
early 6Q's, is again shipping ore
under lease and bond. The mine
has been worked spasmodically
for many years, although it has
produced rich copper and silver
ore. It is hoped that the old
property has taken on a new
lease of life and will again be a
factor in the production of the
copper ore of the state.
Blake, Moffitt & Towne, the
great wholesale paper firm of
Los Angeles, will establish a
branch office in Phoenix. It will
be under the direction of E. A.
Doran, who has had charge of
company's business in this state.
Henceforth Doran's headquart
ers will be in Phoenix. Though
he will tour the state as former
ly, he will always be represent
ed at the branch office. Doran
is well known in Tucson.
The old hard luck of repub
lican candidates for governor of
Arizona seems to have attached
itself to Tom Campbell early in
the game. His friends put him
on a horse and discover that he
can't- ride; he almost gets his
neck broke. He goes out on the
desert, gets caught in a cloud
burst, he can't swim and he gets
almost drowned. His party puts
him up for governor but when
the ballots are counted it will be
found that he couldn't run; ha
gets left. Tempe News.
Sonora, Mexico, the state
bordering on Arizona, has settl
ed down to business during the
past few weeks. The big min
ing enterprises at Cananea, El
Tigre and Nazari are now going
at almost full blast and every
where throughout the state
comes reports of renewed busi
ness activity. Sonora has suf
fered much during the five years
of strife but it has not been torn
with such strife as in the state
of Chihuahua. In Sonoru the
officials are doing well by their
own people and Americans who
are carrying on enterprises
there seem to be treated fairly.

An interesting voucher pass
ed through the general offices of
the Ray Consolidated Copper
Company the first of the week;
interesting for two reasons, not
only by reason of the amount
thereof, but more especially for
the fact that it was a gift to the
state. In amount it was $14,
457. CO, and it was sent to the of
cials of the University of Ari
zona at Tucson as the proportion
of the Ray Consolidated Copper
Company's payment for the erec
tion of a building for the College
of Mines, a part of the State
University. Altogether there
was contributed $100,000 by the
mining companies of the state,
those contributed being the Cop
per Queen, the Detroit Copper
Mining Company, Old Dominion,
Inspiration, Calumet & Arizona
and the Miami Company.
All National Guard organiza
tions composed of College stud
ents will be mustered out of the
Federal service in time for them
to proceed with their school
work at the fall term. It has
been announced at the War De
partment that the policy of gov
ernment would be to disband
such eryanizations completely as
units of the National Guard and
to seek thu reorganization of the
college into branches of the of
ficers' reserve corps. Individual
members of the National Guard
organizations who can show their
intention of entering or return
ing to schools or college for the
fall term will be mustered out
September 1st.
The Nogales Oasis, of last
week, comes to us in the form of
a special industrial edition and
its columns filled with the story
of progress being made in Santa
Cruz county and Nogales, its
capital city. Editor Bird has
covered every subject exhaust
ively and after reading this
paper there will be nothing to
be told, about that section of
Arizona. It shows there is no
lack of prosperity there in any
f the prominent industries.
Santa Cruz county, like Cochise,
is rich in mining, it has the best
cattle ranges to be found in the
state and much has been accom
plished during the past few years
in the way of agricultural devel
opment. The Oasis Editor Bird,
and Nogales and Santa Cruz
county are to be congratulated
on this splendid showing.

INITIATED LAWS.
The second initiated measure
in which the voters will be ask
ed to pass at this fall's election
is numbered 102 and 103 on the
ballots.
' It proposes to exempt from
taxation "all federal, state,
county and municipal property.
Property of educational, charit
able and religious associations
or institutions not used or held
for profit may be exempted from
taxation by law. . Public debts
as evidenced by the bonds of
Arizona, its counties, municipal
ities or other subdivisions shall
also be exempt from taxation.
There shall further be exempt
from taxation, the property of
widows, residents of this state,
not exceeding the amount of
$2,000.00 where the total as
sessments of such widow do
not exceed $5,000.
As the law now extends, if a
widow owns more than $2,000
worth of property, she is entitl
ed to no exemption and also
raises the amount of exemption
from $1,000 to $2,000.
The passage of the proposed
amendment will have practical
ly no effect on state revenues
and will do much' to aid widows
who are trying to keep the little
home together for the family.
It seems a worthy law and
one that should receive an a ffinm
ative vote.
While the tax on a $2,000
home would not appear great, it
is a grevious burden of a woman
left widowed and Arizona can
well afford to be generous in
cases like this. Exchange.
ZEROLENE AT FRONT.
The local Standard Oil agent
recently received from J. E. Bals
ley, district sales manager of the
Standard Oil Company at Phoe
nix, a report on the operation of
the government automobiles and
trucks along the Mexican border.
"A great many of these ma
chines," writes Mr. Balsley, "are
being lubricated with Zerolene
oil. The intense heat and great
amount of low gear work neces
sary in the sand make perhaps
the best test possible of a motor
oil. I am glad to report that
Zerolene is doing the work in
fine shape. Due to its asphalt
base origin, it keeps its lubricat
ing value under the most trying
heat conditions, and none of the
machines have been at all both
ered with carbon deposits in the
cylinders."

MOST UNFORTUNATE DUPES
; k .1 4.1.
who nominated Roosevelt at the
National Progressive conven
tion, and who refuses to be herd
ed by Roosevelt for Hughes,
knows why, and knows how to
tell others why he is now as
much opposed to the colonel as
formerly he was for him.
"The opposition to the presi
dent's re election" he declares,
"proceeds from an unregenerate
republicanism that has weather
ed the danger of reform, reab
sorbed its most vociferous critic
and abandoned itself again, to
rancid reaction.
And of this unregenerate re
publicanism to which the colonel
has returned and to which he is
trying to deliver his former pro
gressive followers, Mr. Colby
says :
"There they are, the old guard.
See for yourself. Count them if
you wish. Cannon and Penrose,
Smoot and Galinger, Jim Wat
son, Joe Keating, Estabrook,
Rodenberg, McKinley of Illinois,
Hert, McGraw, Hemenway,
Crane. Not to speak of the others
too numerous to mention. All
friends of the tariff and among
those fit to govern.
"What business a progressive
has in such company as this I
cannot for the life of me see.
They are the pickets and mon
itors of privilege. Hughes is
only their decoy and retrieve.
If he were elected they would
rope him and tie him as they did
when he was governor in Al
bany, reducing him to plaintive
futility.
"There are, of course, reac
tionary elements in the demo
cratic party. Until lately we
had them in the progressive
party. But the elements in the
democratic party are at the
worst, only a retardation and
drag upon the steady, forward
push which the president has
maintained. In the republican
party the reactionaries are in
the ascendant. They dominate
the party, giving to it their
character and features. It is
the party of reaction and the
progressives who have allied
themselves with it are the most
unfortunate of dupes."
ALL PULL TOGETHER.
Citizens of Tempe have a way
of getting together when it is
necessary to do something for
the public welfare. Some years
ago it was decided to install mu
nicipal water-works. All pulled
together, made little noise about
it, but soon the works were es
tablished. So eminently suc
cessful was this venture that it
has been thought advisable to
either buy the service lightning
plant or to establish a new one.
A meeting was called this week
and some seventy-five citizens
assembled. Without a dissent
ing vote this resolution was
adopted: Resolved that it is the
sense of this meeting, that the
common council of Tempe be re
quested to proceed to call an
election for the purpose of vot
ing bonds for an amount suffi
cient to install a municipal light
ing system for the town of
Tem pe. Messenger.
According to word brought up
from Nogales last night by those
returning from the Santa Cruz
county seat, the writ of applica
tion for habeas corpus in the
case of the State vs. O. S.
French, who was found guilty of
selling liquor, Judge O'Connor,
of the Superior court of that
county denied the application
for the writ and the defendant
was remanded to the custody of
Sheriff Wheeler and will have to
return to jail to await sentence.
The application was for the re
lease of the defendant who had
been found guilty, pending sen
tence, and was taken to Nogales
on a change of venue and an in
teresting point has been settled
that was awaited not only in Co
chise county with interest but
in other counties where similar
cases have been pending. The
decision means that all defend
ants found guilty of selling
liquor will have to remain in
jail pending senteuce. Tomb
stone Prospector.
Initiative Relates to Initiative.
The first law appearing in the
secretary of state's pamphlet this
year and which will be Nos. 100
and 101 on the ballots provides:
"Any measure or amenend
ment to the constitution propos
ed under the initiative and any
measure to which the referendum
is applied shall be referred to a
vote of the qualified electors and
shall become a law when ap
proved by a majority of a total
vote of electors voting at said
election and upon proclamation
by the governor and not other
wise." This measure is designed to
prevent the abuse of the initia
tive and referendum abuses not
unknown in Arizona whereby
a few voters may secure the
passage of hurtful laws by re
ason of the carelessness of the
majority of the electors in not
voting one way or the other.
Unless a majority of the electors
voting cast their ballots for the
proposed law, it should be con
sidered not to have passed and.
may be introduced in the regular
way before the legislature.
