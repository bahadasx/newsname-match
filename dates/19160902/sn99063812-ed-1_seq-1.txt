From Dutch somces It wns reported Bolltnan & Son and Joel T. Ward.
Mr. Dalton stated that Mr. Hood told
him that the Southern Pacific intended
to build the Modoc Northern, and that
they had got ready twice to do so, but
that tho government had Interfered
each time. He was told that the South
ern Pacific would build tho Modoc
Northern Just as soon as tho unmerg
Ing suit was decided by tho govern
ment, which might be this fall.
Mr. Dalton infoimed Mr. Hood that
n lino was of such vital necessity at
once, and that the people were so de
tei mined to have a line, that unless tho
Southern Pacific could make some defl
nitc statement, It would bo necessary
to open negotiations with Mr. Strahorn
for n branch road, In order that tho
present heavy cost of transportation
of pioducts to markets could bo re
duced. Mr. Hood then asked If tho
peoplo would bo satisfied for tho Im
mediate present if n lino was built this
fall fiom Klamath Falls to the Oregon
Onllfornla line, and was told that they
would.
"Ordinarily on a piece of road like
this," said Mr. Hood. "I would order
tho work done, hut under present con
ditions, I prefer tho matter to bo han
dled from the other end.' Ho sug
gested that Mr. Dalton hnvo tho peoplo
of Klamath county take tho matter up
with President Sproule, nnd promised
to recommend the Immediate construc
tion of tho lino when tho matter
reached his oftlce. According to Mr.
Hood, tho lino when built will follow
tho old survey for which rights of way
have already been secured.
It developes that further develop

According to Fred W. West, factory
representative of the Chevrolet Motor
company, who is in Klamath Falls,
calling, on their local representative,
tho Central garage, the new million
dollar plant of the company at Oak
land. Calif., has been accepted by the
architect, and is now ready for busi
ness. The factory will turn out 17,000 cars
during tho 1917 season, of the three
different models. Owing to the in
crease in output the model 490 has
been reduced $80 in price, and now
sells for $570 at Klamath Falls. The
model Baby Grand will sell for $900
here. This car has been remodeled
all through. Longer wheel base, new
stream line body, Stewart vacuum sys
tem, Meston-Mltt floating axle, one
man top and deeper upholstery. Tho
motor has been counter-balanced and
speeded up to 3,000 r. p. m.'s, thereby
eliminating all vibration.
The model "D" eight cylinder valve-in-head
motor will revolutionize the
eight cylinder world. Cantilever
springs are used on this car, samo as
the Baby Grand. The wheel base Is
123 Inches, making the car rldo like
a cradle.
