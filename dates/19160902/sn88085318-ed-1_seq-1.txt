Will Mr, Hughes explain, if
American prosperity is a war
munition product, why bank de
posits'in North Dakota and South
Dakota since 1012 have grown 70
per cent, while Deleware. where
the Dv Tout powder works are
located, is the only state in the
union showing a decrease of bank
loposits in the past four years.
"The labor union vote of Wash
ington will almost unanimously
oppose Governor Hughes for presi
dent." declares Harley 11. Hughes,
well-known Spokane union leader
and an executive officer of the
Washington State Federation of
Labor.
"When I make this assertion, I
have some facts to back it up.
The labor press of this state as
well as in nearly every state in the
union is joining in the opposition
to the election of the New Yorker,
mi the groundß that his attitude
in public life as well a.s on the
Htipreme bench of the United
States lias been unfavorable to la
boring men. The labor papers of
Washington . have consistently
'whacked' Hughes and will con
tinue to do so. I believe that the
dyed-in-the-wool socialists will
support the socialist candidate in
this state and no doubt some of
the 'hard-boiled' republicans will
vote for the G. O. P. nominee, but
the majority of the workiugmen,
be they democratic or republican,
will support President Wilson, for
his constructive legislation has
been a source of great satisfaction
to the working class."
Mr. Hughes stated that he had
made a canvass of the state in the
matter of determining the senti
ment of working men in national
politics and that he predicts a
sweeping victory for President
Wilson.
Not since 1905 has the nation's
drink bill been so low as daring
1915, notable for a marked de
crease in the per capita consump
tion of malt and spirituous Liquors
amounting to 2.70 gallons per
capita. Xo such great change
marks the record for 20 years.
From 11)01-05 the use of alcoholic
beverages was almost on a dead
level for four years, being an
average of 19.61 gallons. The
next five years the average rose to
21.96 gallons, the extremes of the
period being 22.79 gallons.
A drop is recorded from 22.0il
gallons in 1914 to 19.80 gallons in
1915. Here is a 10 per cent de
crease, which if continued would
destroy the liquor traffic in 1"
years, History has oft recorded
the destruction of great industries
in less time. Certainly the record
is encouraging to the advocates
of temperance, and their friends
the prohibitionists.
There is a sociological reason
for this decrease in the use of in
toxicants. Regardless of what
the faddists or the extremists or
the prohibitionists or the local op
tionists or the distillers or the
brewers may claim as the reason
for the change, any student of
sociology can point out dearly the
reason. It may not be clear 1"

have been definitely placed as
great causes of the use of liquor.
The world's students, regardless
of political lines, agree on this.
Take away the condition, give ;i
wholesome environment, and a
better type of citizenship results,
with improvement in moral and
personal status.
The common people have found
that legislation in their interest
has wrought great change. Since
Woodrow Wilson has been in the
White House, the condition of the
American producer has been
changed. Where before he was
at the mercy of the special inter
ests, now he is beginning to get
on his feet. Wall street can no
longer break his bank or bring a
panic. Manufacturers must de
pend on the law of competition
and not on the rule of force. Hours
must not reach to 12 and 15 a day.
The children can not labor when
they should be at school. The
family can not buy drugs likfe
they could in the good old repub
lican days. And the country is
reveling in the money of Europe,
instead of being at war with Ger
many and with Mexico. Wages
are high, and men are not out of
employment. The industrial re
views mark this present period as
at the greatest tide in the history
of the country. No wonder the
working man docs not crave liq
uor, lie has something better in
sight.
Why lias the condition changed!
Look up the legislation of the past
three years, and the steadfast at
tention of our president to the in
lerests of the PEOPLE. While
Wall street and the favored in
terests howl for a return to Taft
methods under Hughes, the popu
laeft is reaping the results of a
■lean citi/.enship administered by
a genuine American citizen. Pros
perity and sobriety have a chance
to abide in the home. No wonder
the captains of intoxicating in
dustry want a change Their
records demand it.

TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courtesy of the American Bank
era Association. Savings Bank Dept.)
DISCOUNTING A NOTE
It so happens in business that
all payments caunot be made in
ensh, for most of the business is
done on credit iv one form or
another. Small purchases and
many of the daily expenditures
are cash transactions; but busi
ness as a whole moves on credit,
the form depending upon the cus
toms characteristic of that pe
culiar business. The most com
mon form of credit is the book
account, where goods are sold and
"charged" to the purchaser.
When you go into the grocer's
and tell him to "charge it," you
are opening a credit with him in
the form of a book account. This
is common to all retailing trans
actions. Hut in the larger deal
ings, the credit is in the form of
a promissory note, which is mere
ly a written promise to pay a sum
certain, in money, to a designated
person, firm or corporation, at a
stipulated time. Hundreds of
thousands of these notes are made
every day. They are given, mer
chant to merchant, in payment of
debti resulting from the Bale of
goods, and while they settle the
debt they must themselves be paid
in money, in order that the obliga
tion may be finally discharged,
for a promise never liquidates 11
debt.
If these promises could be treat
ed as money and passed from hand
to band, they might answer wry
well, but they are not of a uni
form denomination, their good
ness is a matter not commonly
known, and even though the
maker might be "as good as the
government," few know it and
few would take the risk.
And if the holder could wait
until maturity, he would get cash
from the promisor. Hut he docs
not want to wait that long -he
wants to turn his evidence of debt
into money at once; for with
money real money -he can gel
better terms, and for certain pur
poses, such as paying laborers, he
must use cash. There must, there
fore, be some medium through
which he can turn this promise
into money before it is due—for
a price—and that medium is the
bank. The process of doing this
is called discounting, which in
other words means buying the
paper. A simple illustration will
explain.
Suppose A sells B a bill of
goods on three months' credit. A
does not want to wait while U
sells the goods and gets the money
to pay him, and therefore offers
to take B's note for the amount.
But the note is not money, and
if A would use the money he must
find someone who will give him
money for it. He might find
someone who, for the hope of gain,
would advance the money; but
the logical place to get this done
is the bank, for the bank always
has money. It knows men and
their ability to keep their prom
ises, and can judge the quality of
the risk. A therefore offers the
note to his banker, who says in
substance: "I think B is good for
this amount. If you will endorse
- promise to pay if he does not—
I will buy that paper evidence of
debt from you." Let us say it is
for $100, due in three months.
The banker knows that at the end
of three months he will get the
$100, and so gives A $98.50 for it,
the $1.50 being interest on the
money for that time at X per cent.
Ordinarily the banker woidd not
give A the cash, but credit his ac
count with the privilege of check-
Ing against it, which is virtually
the same thing.
Now, what is the result? A
■old his goods and got his money
at once. H had three months to
sell the goods to get the money
to pay the note when the banker
presented it at maturity. A could
