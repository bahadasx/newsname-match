5ai5 Mexico Is Struggling
To Free Itself From
Alien Interests.
WOULD JUSTIFY
FOREIGN POLICY
President Praises Democrats
For Legislation Passed
By Congress.
WASHINGTON'. Dt C Sept. L
Formally accepting his renomt
natlon for president by the
Peraocratio party, president Wilson In
is address this afternoon again re
verted to his policy in Mexico by slur'
ring foreign investors In Mexico as re
sponsible for Mexico's tragic turmoil.
Regarding his Mexican, policy, the
president reiterated that the peoplo
of Mexico were struggling 'blindly it
may be and as yet ineffectually" to
free themselves from alien interests,
some of them American Interests
pi esing for things the never could
have got in their own country,'" and
that he would do everything in his
power to prevent anyone standing In
the way of Mexico in his effort.
"It is hard doctrine," said he, "only i
for those who wish to get something
for themselves out of Mexico.
Attacks Republicans.
"With the members of the notification
committee headed by senator James
grouped about him at Shadow Lawn,
the summer white house, the president
declared the Republican party was
ust the party that cannot meet the
i,ew conditions of a new age" and
that the day of Little Americanism
when "methods of "protection' and in
dustrial nursing were the chief study
of our provincial statesmen" was past
and gone.
"Wo can no "longer Indulge our tra
ditional provincialism" said the presi
dent. "We are to play a leading part
in the world drama whether we wish
it or not. We shall lend, not borrow;
ict for ourselves, not Imitate or fol
low, organize and initiate, not peep
About merely to see where we may get
in."
Saja III" Record Is Consistent.
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia
tions with the European belligerents
the president followed a declaration
tliat while property rights might be
indicated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental
rights of humanity never could be, with
this statement.
The record is clear and consistent
thioughout and stands distinct and
cefimte for anyone to judge who wishes
to know the truth about It."
Doesn't Fear Aliens.
Immediately afterward he hald:
I am the candidate of a party, but
I am above all things else an Ameri
can citizen. I neither seek the favor
no fear the displeasure of that small
alien element among us which puts
lojlty to any foreign power before
lojjlty to the United States.
Vdmlts He lias Made Mistakes.
"Mist? kes I have no doubt made in
this perplexing business but not in
purpose or object." He declared at an
other point
I am more interested In the for
i tunes of oppressed men and pitiful
t women and children than in any prop
erty rights whatever"

the president enumerated the laws I
placed on the statute books relating to
business including tariff revision,

and currency system, rural credits, re

"What other party has understood
the task so well or executed it so in

asked. "What other party has at

' of assisting business but protection.
How to stimulate it and put it upon
a new footing of energy and enter
prise they have not suggested."
V Bid for Progressives.
At the conclusion of his review of
the party record the president declared:
This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of san
guine promises but it is not. It is a
record of promises made four years
ago and now actually redeemed in
constructive legislation." Then, later
he said "We have in four years come
very near to carrying out the plat-
lorm tne regressive party as well as
our own. for we are also progres
sives." The president's address was some
5000 words long one of the most
lengthy he has delivered on any oc
casion since taking office.

SUPERS !HS LABOR TO SI)
II !
WASHINGTON", D O. Sept. 2.
Samuel Gompers, president of
the American Federation of
Labor, in a Labor day message to
workers of the United States, today
practically pledged the federation to
support the Democratic party In the
November elections. Mr. Gompers
urged support of president Wilson and
of the president's Mexican policy, oi
the ground that the one Is the only
president who has worked for justive
for labor since Lincoln, and the other
is the only policy that offers "oppor
tunities for freedom and for inde
pendence." The Labor day message refers to
Mexico as follows:
What He Knows of Mexico.
"The international issue that now
comes closest to the labor movement
is the policy of our government
towards Mexico. The cause of hu
manity is in the balance in Mexico. The
people tnere are trying to worn out
their own problems and to establish
their own'ideals of political, social and
economic justice. The labor movement
in Mexico has developed, that is. the
most power and the most constructive
product of the revolution.
"Representatives of the labor move
ment of Mexico have joined with repre
sentatlves of the labor movement of
America to insure to the workers and
the citizens of Mexico the rights of
human beings, opportunities for free
dom and for independence. Manv of
the problems of the Mexican workers
are problems of the workers of the
United States. Their welfare is our
welfare. The boundarj line between
the two countries is only an artificial
division that has little or no effect
upon the course and the nature of in-
PROTECT SiLL
iTlSJHES
Declares TJ. S. Should Not
Maintain Armed Forces
in Small Countries.
Kansas City. Mo, Sept. 2. The Unit
ed States should protect the Inviola
bility of treaty rights with small na
tions as well as great ones, which it Is
not doing in the case of Santo Domin
go and Haiti, Charles E. Hughes told a
large audience here Friday night.
Mr. Hughes said:
T yield to no one In respect to the
sovereignty of states, great or small,
for the inviolability of treaties, for
rights under International law, but
when we speak of the inviolability of
small states and their rights, what
hare we to say with respect to the
course of the administration in Santo
Domingo and Haiti, wher? today armed
rule exists bj our marines on the soil
of these states.
"We want in this country professions
to match practice. We want deeds to
match words and we want a sure poli
cy which will protect the lives of
American citizens."
Mr. Hughes again declared for pro
tection of American rights, American
peace, American industry and for a
business like administration of gov
ernment. Program Is Constructive.
He declared that his program was
"constructive, not destructive."
"We are desirous of promoting the
success of the national ticket." Mr.
Hughes said, "but we also desire to
have both the senate and the houso. in
order that we may have an administra
tion that will achieve results."
Mr. Hughes said he did not believe m
putting the government into the ship
ping business "to compete with private
owners."
"I do not believe we can accomplish
anything that way," he said. "What
we should do ought to be done cor
rectly and in line with correct poli
cies. Trent Ilnninesn Talrly.
"We should rescue business from un
necessary conflict of authority in this
country. We do not need, simply be
cause we are practicing our local and
our national independence, to have
irreconciliable conflict of authority.
That is a misconstruction of our con
stitutional s j stem.
"We can perfect our instrumentali
ties, so that the state can act in its
sphere and so that business will not
be ground between the upper and lower
millstones
Veterans near Speeeh.
A sprinkling of G A. R. Veterans
was scattered through the crowd. In
opening his speech Mr. Hughes re
ferred to the civil war and the Dart
taken by the veterans in preserving the t
union.
"No one can tell me." Mr Hughes
said, "that we have lost the spirit of
years ago. The same indomitable
spirit is with us today and what we
need is to hearken to its calL"
America faces a test today, Mr.
Hughes declared.
"The test Is." he said, "whether this
nation, so preserved, shall achieve its
highest ideals, whether It shall go for
ward or halt: whether it will be re
sponsive to its ideals or will lose Its
tone and the spirit of Its former life."
"Upon his arrival here Mr. Hughes
sent the following telegram to Theo
dore Roosevelt:
"I heartily congratulate you on your
speech at Lewiston and warmly appre
ciate jour effective support."
