OREN REATY WRITES ON FAIRS
The time for fairs will soon be at
hand and every one should make
plans to take part in these events,
whether they be County, State or
.National. Fairs should be education
al above alt things and in order that
they may lie so it will be necessary
for every one to bring their best
exhibits and attend the fairs them
selves. The exhibits will be judged
on their market value or on the
tpye of produce the market demands
In selecting your exhibits keep this
in mind and do not always pick the
largest or freaks but pick good
smooth marketable products. After
prizes have been awarded, visit the
exhibit hall and take note of where
the ribbons are placed. This will
give you an idea of what type the
markets demand and where your
exhibits lost out or won. Then re
turn home find try to grow the
type demanded. When the stock is
being judged listen to what the
judges have to say.' Find out why
he places the ribbons as he does and
why he turns down other animals.
By this method you will learn the
type of animal demanded and then
strive to grow that kind.
Union county aims to make an x
hibit at the State Fair and a booth
12 by 30 feet has been set aside for
us in the exhibition hall at Albu
querque. Let every one prepare and
bring in the best grain, fruit and
vegetables you have and let us fill
this booth with a creditable exhibit.
Then any Union County visitor at
the Far will be proud to claim Union
County as his home and will not be
ashamed to go look at the booth.
There will be 1000 for the best; $500
for the' second best and $250 for the
third best county exhibit at the State
Fair. , Get a State Fair premium
3
list and see what is desird for this
exhibit and bring everything you
have to the County Fair. The best
exhibits at the County Fair will be
sent on to the State Fair and be
placed on exhibition there. If every
one does their share Union county
will win one of the prizes.
From the State Fair the best ex
hibits will be sent to the Internation
al Dry-Farming Congress to be held
at El Paso. They will be placed ou
exhibition with exhibits from every
dry-farniiug section in Amerca. This
will be a good way to advertise our
county. People from all parts of
the world will attend this Congress
and if we have a creditable exhibit
they will be attracted to the possi
bilities of Union County and will
come here to make homes.
Anyone having exhibits they would
like to send ' to the Dry-Farming
Congress can lave same at my of
fice in Court House. Write name
and address plainly on package and
if you can not bring it in yourself
send it by someone. If you will bring
in information as to cultural meth
od, rainfall and yields. I will as
sist you in preparing charts stat
ing these things. This adds to the
educational values of fairs.
The Union County Fair will be
held in Clayton, September 19, 20, 21,
and 22, and every citizen should
bring exhibits and attend the fair.
