eight men participated, while ' tho

HERE aro ethics in head
hunting, according to Dr.
William Curtis Fnrabee, who
has just got homo after
three year i.pcnt In explor
ing remote regions of the
Amazon river in South Amer
ica. Among the tribes ho
visited were two, the Munduruciis nnd
tho Jlveros, who still keep up the
practice. One of tho trophies he
brought back for the University of
Pennsylvania was a collection of four
hells nuido of human teeth thu most
1 ' ZZ ,T ' S"' .
, """'en could possess, according to an
. interview with Dr. Farubee In
I New York Sun.
I As to the ethics of head hunting Dr.
Farubee says no self-respecting Mun
durucu or Jlvero would go forth with
bow anil arrow and stone hatchet after
tho head of a national enemy becnuM
of the pilugs of hunger or the desires
of trade expansion. Head hunters are
not cannibals nor aro they ambitious
; .for aggrandizement. On thu rontrary
they regard themselves ns lovers of
peucu. But from tlmo immemorial
i feuds havo existed among them, nnd
I the only worthy method of treating
I their traditional enemies Is to seek
and obtain their heads.
When a head is brought In by an
Intrepid warrior tho village prepares
to celebrate the exploit by assembling
around u fire over which a potion
rivaling that of tho witches of "Mac
beth" Is concocted. If It Is a Mundu
rueti village the head of the enemy.
I utter having been boiled to the re
quired tenderness, Is smoked for Its
I preservation and the teeth are ex
tructcd. A threo days dance Is held
In honor of the victory.
1 Tho Jlveros, however, vary the
process by removing the bones from
tho head of thu enemy and shrinking
It to Die proportions of a big man's
fist. This 4s also preserved an ob
ject lesson perhaps for the rising
generation.
The belts testifying to the existence
of head hunting are but a small part
of tho collection brought back after
what scientists regard as thu most
hazardous trip ever made Inlo the
forest of the Amazon. Excavations of
prehistoric pottery nnd burial vases,
sonio of them moro than threo feet
tall; records of the music of Indians
never before visited by white men,
ethnological work mining more than
thirty tribes heretofore known by
name only nro all Included In Dr.
Farubcc's achievement.
.Most of the ovplora-s of the Amazon

Dr. Farubee arrived nt Pnra In June,

on tho edge of British Guiana two

of all the expeditions, the Journey Into
the unexplored forest in southern Brit
ish Guiana.
.Melville did his best to dissuade Dr.
Fnrabee from the trip, declaring that
the chances were against his coming
out alive. Dr. Farabee refused to be
dissuaded, but persuaded Oglhio to go
with him. Six months Inter .Melville
passed them on the street, nnd so
changed were they by the effects of
me Journey that lie d.Id not recog
nizo tliem. Dr. Farubee's account of
that trip is thrilling.
"It was most successful." he said
"From December 10, 1013, to Apill 1,
1014, we wero among' tribes who had
never seen white men before. All of
them were ery Interesting. None
had over seen matches or guns or
salt or clothing before. All had bead
and knives; nil wanted fishhooks, nnd
many got their first ones from us.
"On our trip Into the Wnlwnl coun
try It was necessary to reduce tho
party to six, four Indians, Ogllvle and
myself. A larger party couldn't live
on the country. The tribes live far
apart, often ten or twelve days over
rough mountains ami across rivers.
Three-fourths of the time and all of
the last month we had to depend upon
tho game nnd fish we could catch.
Our aiiiiiiunllbm got low, but tho In
dians with us used their bows and ar
rows well. When we got out we had
two loads of shot and seventeen rllle
cartridges left a narrow margin.
"Ogllvle had been fourteen years In
the bush and was tho best man 1 ever
saw for such work, but he found hero
tho worst waterfalls ho had ever seen.
in wnat are known as the Great
Fulls we spent several days. It was
Impossible to get through. Wo car
ried over thing overland to the foot or
tho falls on (he Dutch side and there
to our Joy wo found four large canoes
belonging to men hunting bnlata gum,
who were deep In tho forest. I took
ono Indian and followed a trail for
two days, but could not find them.
This was the worst trip of my ex
perience. Ogllvle was loo weak to go.
There was nothing else to do but to
take one ofthe strange canoes, a great
criiuu In Dutch (lulaua. The next day
we met some negroes and persuaded
them to take us down to the first store
and to return (ho on nop.
"We got out none loo soon, as Ogll
vle was having fever every night anil
I severe chills and fever every other
Kin. iiaving lever all night mid
working hard nil dny on poor food
cut us to pieces rapidly. When I left
Philadelphia my weight 'was 1K1

Serious troubles. If they be not too
serious or numerous, nre beneficial In
that they teach us the folly of taking
tho trivial ones much to heart.

storehouse It was 14r pounds. Wo nr-j
rived bareheaded and barefooted and,
starved, of course."
Of the characteristics nnd customs,
of the natives he met during tho
course of the expedition Dr. Fnrabee'
Is enthusiastic. After their first ttmidi
Ity at the appearance of white men
had vanished they wero courteous nnd
gracious anil received tho explorers
with a hospitality from which Hut
white man could well take lessons.
Ono of tho most plcturosquo experi
ences encountered by Dr. Farrabee and
his party was when they cumo upon a
village assembled for the purpose of
curing onu of Its inhabitants of a
poisonous snake bite. The victim was
stretched upon tho ground. Around
him wero dancers who after sucking
tho wound alternately blew and spat
upon not only the bite but nil of the
man's joints. In nn outer circle sat
the musicians, who played such nn
