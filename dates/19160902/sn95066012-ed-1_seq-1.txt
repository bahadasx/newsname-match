Cost of Patrol One Reason for Re
turning Organizations to State
Control
Washington, Sept. 1. All of the
National Guard will return to their
mobilization camps in the various
states by October 1. This Informa
tion was given by a high authority to
day with the additional statement
that the government proposes to re
lease the guard from federal service
soon after the units arrive at their
state destinations.
"The only complications likely to
prevent the carrying out of this pro
gram," said the official, "is that there
should be a fatal break between the
United States and Mexico at the ap
proaching sessions of the internation
al commission."
The official regards the strike situa
tion as practically settled and thinks
the service of the guard will not be
needed for anything connected with It.
The expense of maintaining the
guard in the federal service is given
as one of the reasons for returning
the organizations to state control. A
federal soldier costs the government
about $1,000 a year. According to fi
gures obtained today there are on the
border about 105,000 of the militia,
15,000 are on the way home and 26,000
remain in the states under call. The
total on the pay rolls is 145,000.

Anglo French Expected to March
on Greek Capital
TRANSPORTS OFF PlfiEUS HARBOR
German Ships in Greek Harbors Have
Been Seized by Warships of
Entente Powers.
London, Sept. 2. Allied troops are
reported to have been landed at Pi
nna with the intention of marching
live miles northeast to Athens for the
purpose of putting an end to German
intrigue in the Greek capitol. Allied
transports are reported to be off
Plreus harbor. London continues to
hear reports of King Constantino's ab
dication.
Warships of the allies have seized
a number of Herman ships in Greek
harbors.
London, Sept. 2, The British offlci"
al jiress representative at Salonica
sends definite word to Loudon that
King Constantino nas abdicated.
The press representative says the
king had abdicated In favor of the
crown prince with Vcnizelos as the
power behind the throne. The new
policy, he reports, will be to work
with the entente nllies. According to
this information. Premier ZaJmiS will
remain at the head of the govern
ment. The correspondent questions wheth
er the entente allies desire the active
assistance, of Greece. Various ru
mors are in circulation at London in
regard to the situation in Greece.
Renter dispatches from Salonica say
there has been lighting between the
Greek garrison at Salonica and Greek
volunteers recently organized to as
sist the Greek regulars who are re
sisting the Bulgarians in Macedonia
French troops intervened to suppress
the lighting, and the garrison finally
surrendered and marched out of BaY
Ionics,
Ward Price, the official Hritisli
press representative, was dosi minted
by the government to act lor all Unt
il publications at Salonica. Never
theless, his dispatches are subject not
only to Greek censorship but to the
French military censorship, which Is
In control of all lines of communica
tion from Athens. The fact that both
censorships as well as the Hritisli cen
sorship in London have permitted this
dispatch to come through, is regarded
as significant.
On Tuesday Mr. Price sent from
Salonica a report that King Constan
tine had tied from Athens to Larissa
I'liis dispatch was discredited in offi
cial circles in London. Doubt also
appeared to be cast on its correctness
bv dispatches filed from Athens on
Wednesday, one ol (hen telling of
coming meetings iieiween the King
md the entente ministers and others
having to do with the illness of the
king, who recently underwent a slight
Operation. It is possible, however.
Unit the king may have departed s
cretly fro Athens, as reported by Mr.
Price, and that his absence was con
coaled irom tne newspaper correspon
dent!, there.
Crown Prince George of Greece
whose accession to the throne Is re
pui'tcd. has iteen desi-ribed as a man
of liberal mind, in true sympathy
with the MPimtionS 0( the Greek
people. He was born July in. 1890
and is unmarried. His engagement
to Princess Fllzabeth of Rumania was
announced in l'.Ht. hut owing to Ih
war the wedding was postponed. The
crown prince has kept in the back
ground during the war. When the
entente troops landed at Salonica last
year the king sent the crown prince
to lake charge ot the Greek forces
there. It was reported several months
ago that the prince had been sent on
a mission to the German ami Aus
trlan emperors.
The correspondent al Salonica of
Heater's telegram company, under
date of Wednesday, also sends the n
port that King lonstlne of Green
has abdicated, adding, Tending con
Urination, it must be mentioned with
all reserve." The correspondent says
thai the report is Unit the king has
abdicated, that the Creek crown

JOHN P. ST. JOHN DEAD
Sturdy Orator Who Helped to
Make
"Prohibition" Kansas.
John P- St. John, a candidate for the
presldmuy on fjnj ,urvljil4tion ticket
m 1SS4, twice Koverjior of Kansas, and
oiie-ol the most widely know n tetBiu r-
ance advocates in the United States,
died at Olattia, Kan., Thursday night.
He was 8;i y ears old and liud been in
failing health since a heat prostration
two months ago while on a speaking
tou.
John Pierce St. John was one of the
most widely known temperance advo
cates in the United States. He was a
candidate for president on the prohibi
tion ticket in 1884. and served two
terms as governor of Kansas 1879
1883 during which Kansas became a
prohibition State.
I (escribing the fight for prohibtion
in Kansas, Governor St. John once
said:
"The brewers had only themselves
to blame for prohibition in Kansas.
The first step .tow ard a State wide
movement was at their suggestion.
Mr. Fiery, a minister, introduced in
the House a high license and regula
tion hill. It stood a good chance of
passage. To defeat it, the brewery
agents suggested the people be given
an opportunity to vote on Statewide
prohibition. Of course it was not the
purpose of the brewers to submit pro
hirrftion at all. But fh'e coup to kill
the high license bill killed the saloon
in Kansas.
"The prohibitory amendment was
submitted to the Senate and passed.
The House was to kill it. The brewers
had it all figured out. Enough mem
bers favored high license, but not pro
hibition, they believed, to defeat any
attempt to submit the proposition to
the people. The brewers guessed
wrong about public sentiment.
"Every influence was brought to
bear on House members by the brew
ers. I was governor, but i couldn't
keep out of the light. Violating all
precedent. 1 left tho governor's office
to help fight the battle on the House
flco.v
"The day for the vote came. The
galleries were packed. The politicians
tried hard to avoid a vote by hiding.
The sergeant-at arms was busy round
ing them up and bringing them into
the chamber. Finally the voting was
begun. The silence was intense. We
needed one vote to get the necessary
two thirds to carry the proposition
through. We did not know how to .get
It. All at once Mrs. Greaver (the
wife of one of the members) started
down the aisle to her husband's desk.
She stopped before him. and seizing
his hand in hers pleaded with him.
" 'For my sake, lor the sake of your
children,' she cried, 'change your vote.
io it ror my sake, lor my sake, no
matter what you believe.'
"Greaver changed his vote, while
the building shook with cheers."
Bom at Brookville. Intl.. Februarv
. 1833, St. John served as a captain
and lieutenant colonel In the Civil
War. and settled in Kansas, where he
became A member of the State Senate
He became a political factor when he
won a light to displace I'nlted 8tates
Senator Samuel K. Pomeroy. Pom
eroy and St. John had been personal
Iriends, but the latter became dis
pleased with the way Pomeroy con
ducted himself as a senator, ami
thereupon championed John l. ingaiis
Pomeroy's opponent, who won. This
made St. John a leader and resulted in
Ins ele tion as governor.
He was called a "traitor" when he
deserted the Republican party and be
came a candidate for president on the
prohibition ticket in 'N4. was twice
shot at. but unhurt. Many republi
cans attributed the defeat of James 0,
Blaine for president, to St. John's en
trance Into the race.
In 1913, notwithstanding his ad
valued age, he stumped Kansas for
woman suffrage, declaring that when
women had the vote they would have
prohibition. In P.G4 he campaigned in
the Fast lor prohibition. estimating
that up to that time he had, altogeth
er traveled 35U.OOO miles and delivered
4.5ml speeches in behalf of tho pro
liibltlon cause.
When he was in the Kansas enpiiol
he inaugurated tie Hist "water ban

been under taboo In the Kansas Statt
House ever since.

ONLY TWO DEMOCRATS OPPOSED
Measure Reported to Meet Approval
of Brotherhoods and Should
Avert Strike.
Washington. Sept. 2. The United
States senate passed the forenoon in
an argument over the passage of the
eight hour day bill for railroad em
ployes which It is expected will avert
the threatened strike called for Mon
day morning. It was agreed that the
passage of the bill would be put to
vote at 0 o'clock.
Washington, Sept 2. Prevention
of the threatened railroad strike
through an act of Congress seemed
assured last niglit, after the House bv
an overwhelming vote had passed the
IdamsOn elght-hour-day law and the
Senate had aureed to take a final vote
no the measure not later than G
clock this evening.
Although it is possible that Senate
amendments may make conferences
necessary, it is generally believed on
both sides of the capitol that when the
test conies, the House bill as it stands
will be accepted and rushed to
Shadow Lawn. N. J., for President
Wilson's signature.
While no formal announcement
were forthcoming from the employes'
brotherhoods last night, it is authori

eral Electric Plant
DEMAND TEN PER CENT INCREASE
International Officers Instruct Men to
Maintain Order and Refrain from
Demonstrations.
Plttsfield, Sept. 2. A strike effect
ive at 'J o'clock this morning was call
ed at the General Electric company's
plant yesterday afternoon, according
to an announcement made by the In
ternational ollicers of seven different
unions among the employes. The un
ion officials claim that the failure of
the management to recognize their or
ganizations in their demands for an in
crease of 10 per cent in wages is re-
ponsible for the strike order. About
6000 hands are employed at the fact
ory, and or these tne moor leauers
laim 8600 are union members.
International officers maintain that
there are now but 4500 employes at
the plant and that 3600 of them will
walk out this morning. All who have
been Instructed to walk out today
have been told to maintain order and
to desist from unnecessary demonstra
tion. It is said that all efforts to meet
Mr. Chesney !:ave failed. It was
stated yesterday at Mr. C hesney s
home that he is out of the city. It
lias, been asserted that he will remain
out for a week or more and that he Is
to stay this week at a hunting camp in
the Adirondack fountains. Another
Story, affirmed by a cab driver, was
to the effect that he drove Mr. Chesney
to his home late Thursday night.
