EXPOSED IN
THE WESTERN
The north drift, on the 500-foot
level of the United Western late yes
terday broke into what is said to be
the richest ore found in the district
outside of the Tom Reed and the
United Eastern. It was impossible
to learn the size of the pay streak,
but the management was jubilant over
the find. The drift has been carried
into the depression to the north side of
the claim, where the ore apparently
formed in the softer material.
It was in this part of the claim that
the Miner man pointed out long ago
that an ore body could be expected in
the property. The work of driving in
other directions for the purpose of try
ing to pick up the continuation of the
United Eastern ore shoot was believed
would prove a failure, and that an
other ore shoot would be uncovered in
the mine. That this has been done is
of great interest to the camp of Oat-
man, which has been languishing on
account of the failure of the well
financed properties to make good.
The United Western has been well
equipped and in excellent hands dur
ing its career, and now that it is open
ing rich ore it should put many people
who stood with it on their feet.
IVA10E HAS WATER
IN DRIFT AND VEIN
PANNING FREE GOLD
The Ivanhoe has struck a big flow
of water in its drift at the 500-foot
level and with it a vein of ore that
may prove to be of milling grade.
Manager A. G. Keeting informed the
Daily Miner yesterday that he had
not even been out there since the
water and ore were struck, which was
last Saturday, but that he had been
informed by the mine superintendent
that it panned gold. Mr. Keating is
having samples assayed and will
-inow more about it today.
There has been but one shift for
several weeks at the Ivanhoe, but it
is stated upon authority that if this
ore proves good after further penetra
tion of the drift three shifts will be
employed and the property worked for
all there is in it
This ledge has been drifted upon
for several weeks. It lies at the
south side of the OUie Oatman dyke,
which was crosscut to find it. There
have been slight values throughout
with much to encourage and only gen
eral conditions during the summer
have prevented work on a larger scale.
Much cannot be done until a pump-1
ing plant is in use, but the pump used
in the Big Jim before the new tur
bine was received is available, though
it is doubtful if the Ivanhoe plant has
the power for this added load. That
being the case it will be a matter of
another pump or more power.
BIG RAILROAD IN
PAYS VISIT TO CAMP
W. S. Stall, of Pittsburg, a director
of the Pennsylvania railroad, departed
for the coast recently after stopping
one dav in camp. He visited while
here with his friend, . Frank Strong,
of the Big Injun and Oatman-Empire
companies. He will return after a
few weeks and make an extended stay,
which will be during cooler weather.
Mr. Stall expressed himself favorab
ly with what he saw of the mines of
Oatman. It is admitted that he plans
becoming more heavily interested in
the camp and his visit will be in the
nature of a thorough personal inspec
tion of properties with which he has
affiliations and others that have been
'put up to him.
DIFFICULTIES OF JOB
OF Mil
Sometimes his title is manager,
others it is superintendent, but, any
way, the executive officer of a mine
or prospect has difficulties to meet
from within, which are invisible tu
the public, as well as otaers from
without, -ahich are vislb'e. ?.fr.rig
companies, like flesh, are weak ard it
so happens at times that nanagers,
f.ui erinteadents and engineers are ex
pected to do more than take care of
the mere physical work of handling
their properties to the satisfaction of
the last whim of their employers, but
they are expected also to ease the
news out to the public of what the
mine is (not) doing and what ore it
has (not) struck. On the other hand
they are required, at times to not only
give out no information, but to look
honest and swear there is none and
if there was it would be nobody's
business.
To illustrate the point mining com
panies may be divided into two gen
eral classes. One is the close cor
poration which has no shares to sell
to the public, nothing to promote and,
which regards the public as a fifth
wheel to its auto and, therefore, not!
exactly necessary. Into this class
the ones that have developed plenty
J.of ore, have mines and not prospects
and think they have no favors to ask.
The second is the promotion, which
Avants the public to know all there is
to know and sometimes a lot more,
kind in this class fall the ones that
!have down to a nicety the practice of
the art of pyramiding the public con
fidence and incidentally their own
shares far away 'and above their in
trinsic value, which in other words,
takes the form of so-called manipula
tion.
The young mining engineer grad
uates from college and goes out and
works for a couple of years as a
miner. He then is ready to accept
'something better in either of the three
designated employments manager,
superintendent or engineer. Or he
may be a man in middle life or old
'age, out of employment and needing
it so badly that he cannot afford to
turn down anything at any rate for
"a little while." Soon he discovers
bwhat he already knew, that he is re-
quired not only to do certain work and
ito get more work out of other men,
but that he must make the facts ap
pear just as his company requires
them to be interpreted. Many a man
in middle life, who knows nothing- but
mining and who has a family depen
dent upon him, feels excused in de
veloping, or making use of, if already
developed, a mining conscience, and he
feels at any rate that his family
somes first. A young engineer with-
jout a reputation has his career before
him and he prizes it more than if it
were behind him. Getting employ
ment and holding it are his besetting
difficulties and there are times when
he is placed in a position of having
to make slight choice between courses
of action that lead to altogether diff
erent destinations.
Both of these are thrown into con-
tact with both classes of mining com
panies, more generally the latter of
the two with something to sell or
promote. Most of them are honest.
as men go, and the voune man fortu
nate enough to not be asked to em
ploy unseemly methods counts himself
fortunate indeed.
But whether it be to bull or bear
the stock, to helD out the immediate
purposes of- either the promotion or
the close corporation that wishes to
get better terms from the seller or
buy out its neighbor or freeze out
other stockholders, the mine executive
is the man upon whom the ruling
forces thrust the responsibility of
'substantiating the facts or alleged
facts in regard to the mine. It goes
so far at times as to take the form
of signatures to writings and these
are a part of the job of the man who
accepts the position and expects to
hold it with all sorts of employers
and all sorts of vicissitudes of the
I mining game.
some mine executives acquire re
putations while yet in their younger
careers and the majority of them
take their success with equanimity.
Others get "swelled up" and remain
so until they lose a job or two, finally
getting over it, as a rule, and learn
ing the bitter fact that they are on
the same level as ordinary mortals.
Thereafter they are the more useful in
their vocation.
Being only human they are affected
by they environments the same as are
other humans. Some believe a rich
man has no rights; others that a poor
man has none. To the latter class
belong those who are sometimes found
in the employ of close corporations
and who think that the owner of a
few shares of stock in a mine have no
rights whatever, that big capitalists
alone have rights in mining, that when
a mine is discovered no one has a
right to own a lot or participate in
its creation of wealth, unless such
person is already a mult-millionaire.
Still being human, there are others
who are worked into a way of think
ing which winds up in asset belief
that anything is fair if it sells a share
of stock, or a lot or a piece of ground
that has stakes on it to be designated
as claims. The promoter field is open
to many and in the east the great
majority of investors must read an
engineer's or a superintendent's re
port, regardless of the contents of
the report, before the matter of buy
ing stock can proceed further to the
first preliminaries of a conversational
stage.
But there is a cure for all ills, if
taken in time. Success is the cure
for what might be mental wayward
hess in a mining engineer. If he wins
success early enough in life, he can
be independent and his mere name
commands big money. Then he is
sought to make reports and whatever
'he says calls for respect. It is then
that he can lay down the law to
either the close corporation or the
promoter. He is as independent as
the pilot who supersedes the master
when in charge of the ship.
In Oatman there is not one but
several mining engineers who have
'attained to a degree that position in
the mining world and it is to the cre
dit of the camp that they thing enough
of it to put aside former affiliations
and cast their lots here. Some of the
mining engineers of this camp have
world reputations and among them
are to be found men who they have
found a camp to tie to and they in
tend to stay with it
DEPUTY TELLS UNION
MEIERS TO BEAT IT
Deputy Sheriff Tom Hunter paid a
visit to Mazona yesterday morning
and made a social call upon a member
of the Bootleggers' union in very good
standing-. He informed the gentlemen
that he would have to retire from
business.
"Do you mean it?" beseechingly
asked the business man and union
member.
"I certainly do," said the officer,
whose neck was bowed as he spoke.
"You will have to pack your traps."
"WelL I am not making a living."
"Not making a. living-, with booze at
?2 a quart?"
"Not earning: my salt."
"Well, youH have to close up and
beat it"
The gentleman agreed.
Then the deputy came up to Oatman
and had like conversations with a cou
ple of other members in good stand
ing. One of them, more's the pity,
had ice and all the fixings to keep
things cool and fine. But the deputy
was obdurate. He would listen to.
nothing, and refused to consider a
typewritten, certified statement of re
sources, liabilities, profit and losses..
VISITING KINGMAN
Mrs. T. R. Scott, representing- the
National Free Tuberculosis Sanatorium
at Alamogordo, N. M., was a Kingman
visitor yesterday. Mrs. Scott is state
secretary of the association, with resi
dence at Flagstaff. She reports that
the organization is meeting- with great
success. Many cottages are to be built
in Alamogordo, which are to be placed
at the disposal of sufferers of the
dread white plage without cost
GREEN STOCKINGS
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
At the Star theatre tonight a pair
of ladies' green silk .stockings will be
presented to the lucky lady or gentle
man in the audience by Lou "let 'er
rip." It will be the confounding mys
tifying show of the season and well
worth while. Tomorrow, amateur
night; local talent
It is the easiest matter in the world
for people with the best intentions,
but not conversant with all the "ins"'
and "outs" of the Oatman situation
to get a wrong; impression from the
fact that a number 'of properties have
been closed down;.
Here is the situation with the Long
and Mclver properties and any per
son with horse sense and an eye to
business must admit that both of
those qualities have- been exercised to
a degree. Each of those companies
and anything that. Long and Mclver
are connected with have good fat
bank accounts real money in the
bank and plenty of it to operate with
out permission of anybody for several
months. But sizing- the situation up
'one side and down- the other, it was
decided that it would" be better to
close with plenty of cash on hand)
and then be able to resume at any
time the management might see fit.
By so doing, in case it might be nec
essary to offer more treasury stock
it can be done with a straight look-you-in-the-eye,
that the mine is work
ing and has cash to go on. But to
keep on going until' the last dollar is
gone and then simply" have to close
'down would make it all the worse for
Oatman later on and' infinitely worse
for the companies trying to sell stock
with which to make- the re-opening
start.
Not that this applies to all com
panies that have shut down. Some
have spent all their money and others
have saved out what will be found to
be little enough, if not less than that,
but there are others which have looked
at it in precisely the manner indicated
and have closed down until fall with
the finest kind of bank rolls.
It is the fashion to not a small ex
tent for pessimists there are several
here to blame the newspapers for
everything. Also with some who
'otherwise are optimists. A case in
point: The Telluride has a fine show
ing on the 475" level of solid ledge
matter assaying a few dollars, which
should make ore. Not wishing to
have another so-called flash in the
pan, but knowing the developments
as they proceeded, the newspapers re
frained for days from publishing a
reported strike, even though it was
talked on the streets night and day
by every man-, woman and child in
Oatman. If a crosscut to the f ootwall
were run it probably would be found'
to have a- good width of milling- ore
now.
The Lexington has even lower val
ues on the- Banging wall side of its
ledge than- those in the Telluride yet
by crosscutting to the foot it uncov
ered a good width of good grade mill
ing ore: The Telluride management
fully realizes that, but wishes- to
strike- another United Eastern with
ore from foot to hanging; and' pro
poses to find it by sinking to at least
the 600-foot level and get under it,
rather than work to the same end by-
further exploration at this- time above
that depth.
Alt mines in this country are classed
as "hot . That they are not coia an
army of witnesses can- be had to testi
fy. During the summer weather it is
diffilult to work them with any satis
faction to the men or companies
either. Wages paid now do not bring
the amount of results that the same
investments will bring- a month later.
That and the financial reason, the
latter in either of the two forms out
lined above, constitute the principal
reasons for less activity now than
what there will be during the months
to come.
MISS FANNIE M. SAWYER
UNDERGOES OPERATION
Mrs. Ross H. Blakely yesterday re
ceived a letter from San Francisco
conveying the information of the ser
ious illness of Miss Fannie M. Sawyer
at one of the Bay City hospitals.
Miss Sawyer was suddenly stricken
with an attack of appendicitis and was
operated on. Her recovery is doubt
ful as the surgeon in charge stated
that her case was one of the most
complicated that had come under his
observation. Her many friends in
Kingman will regret her illness and
hope for her speedy recovery.
KNOX INSPECTS NEW
L
Charles E. Knox arrived from the
coast yesterday forenoon and will re
turn, there today. He made a visit
during; the afternoon to the Arizona
Central shaft, accompanied by Super
intendent W H. Hart, J. A. Burgess,
superintendent of the United Eastern,
and the Daily Miner correspondent
At 365 feet the shaft has cut a
stringer or possible vein of calcite and
quartz with considerable oxidation. It
lies quite flat with a southerly dip and
is holding out yet with a depth into
it of five feet on the north side of
the shaft With it is the first water
encountered in. the shaft It is flow
ing- ten gallons a minute.
The matter of crosscutting from the
350-foot, point for the vein cut at 230
feet fs being- considered. If it is done,
the shaft will first be continued to
400', which will give a deep sump for
the water. Sinking- proceeds rapidly,
averaging a fraction more than five
feet a day.
A. vein comes out of the Ollie Oat
man- dyke near No. S shaft of the Tom
Reed',, striking directly for the Cen
tral' shaft A few feet northerly and
between the shaft and the United
Western, is a rhyolite dyke, which un
doubtedly has influenced any veins and
ore depositions that may occur at that
licality.
The shaft is at the same elevation
as the No. 2 shaft of the United East
ern,. and on a direct Ene with No. 1
of that company, the Tom Reed and
others-- to the southeast
GREAT WORK DONE
In round numbers the Carter mine
has2000 feet of work done from the
surface- to the 350-fbot leveL On the
250 and 350 each the amount of cross-
cutting- and drifting amounts to 675
feet The shaft is 350 and in another
part of the property there is an open
ing- of 161 feet and still another to
make up the balance.
Drifting- is proceeding on bpth-lev-els-
and energetic efforts upon the
part of Superintendent W. H. Munds
are being: directed toward opening an
ore body on. the 350 that will average
up to the Che milling grade found on
the 250. There are splendid prospec
tive indications in the form of values
and it is the beh'ef of many that if
there is to be another real mine in
Oatman it will be the Carter. Indeed,
there are some authorities who do not
hesitate in declaring that in time it
will be the great mine of all of them.
It has a ledge that strikes north
easterly and southwesterly, going di
rect from the shaft to that of the
Lucky Boy and Telluride.
AT DEPTH LOOKS WELL
The incline shaft of the Jerome
Oatman has reached a depth of 400
feet, according to information from
Superintendent B. P. Dellabanty. He
states that it is looking favorable with
the formation and ledge matter min
eralized but no ore of consequence for
milling has been exposed as yet There
is a continuous flow of water, which
keeps the pump at work its fall share
of time. After a certain depth it is
planned to start drifting in two direc
tions for ore shoots that the manage
ment feels certain, of finding-.
Aside from its own excellent sur
face and underground showing, the Je
rome is in a country that holds out
every encouragement from a past rec
ord of 56 years. It is a close neighbor
of the old Hardy mine, not far from
the Gaddis and Perry ledge, a short
way from the old Navy tunnel and the
Record Lode property, and end-lines
on the southeast the "Shorty" Warner
group. West of it are the Big Lode,
Times and others of importance.
SNOW TAKES CHARGE
H. C. Snow is again in charge of the
St Francis hotel after several weeks'
receivership in the hands of W. K.
Smith.
UNITED EASTERN IS
SHAFT CONNECTION
The United Eastern has started
raising from a depth, of 690 feet under
No. 2 shaft and soon, will be sinking;
from 590 to complete the shaft to the
former depth..
The designation, of 690 in the new
shaft corresponds with the 565 in No.
1 and 590 with 465 the latter depth
having been, reached recently by con
necting the raise from the 590 to meet
the shaft from the 350. It had been
sunk to that depth, before the instal
lation of the 75-foot gallows frame.
To reach the "present extreme depth
of the mine from No. 2 shaft it will
go a total of. 790-feet, corresponding
to the 665 level of No 1.
The company, will proceed with
sinking immediately upon completion
thereof.
The two ball mills- for grinding the
ore to proper mesh for the tube mills
have been placed' on. the concrete and
are nearly ready to do their part of
the work. They- take the place of
stamps. They use chrome steel' balls
instead of Norway pebbles and the big
cylinders revolve- on the same plan
as tube mills; pulverizing the rock
after it leaves the crusher.
A second one: of the tube mills- ar
rived Tuesday and. a third is on: the
way. This wilt he the complete, bat
tery. These will use chrome steel
balls also, and; from them the pulp
will go into' the cyanide, there being:
no amalgamation..
OATMAN; INFLUX AFTER
WEATHER MODERATES
"There is no, question that there will
be a lot. of people here after the
weather gets a little cooler," said. W.
A. Judges yesterday. He returned re
cently from, a sojourn of several weeks
on the coast. "They think mighty
well of this camp, and they have good
reason for- it
"But it is not hot here as I ex
pected to find it The temperature is
about; the same as Los Angeles has
been- recently, though the- summer
there certainly was fine. It got hot
there- before I left and if anything I
like' the Oatman weather betten.
"The Telluride is looking fine and I
believe it will make a minei. It has
struck a big water flow below- the 485
in the shaft, but when ample pump
ing- facilities are in use t understand
it will go on down to the 600 and it
ought to strike a big ore shoot That
on the 475 was not bad, but Long and
Mclver are after the big thing and are
going- deep to get it They believe
in doing- things right'"
IS
J. W. Hill, a clerk in the Arizona
Stores, is the man who pulled off the
dog and badger fight in July at the
Desert Inn theatre, winning great
plaudits for his histrionic ability. It
now comes to- pass that it is on him
in a way. He went to Williams sev
eral weeks ago on a visit and should
have been back before this time, but
circumstances over which he has no
control are detaining him.
The particular circumstances is that
he took a ride out with a physician
friend one evening, a distance of three
miles from Williams, to call upon a
sick person. The doctor discovered
that it was a case of smallpox. He
asked Mr. Hill to remain and watch
the place while he went back to town
and made a quarantine declaration, as
required by law. An officer returned
in a few hours and quarantined the
family, and included Mr. Hill, which
is why he has had to remain away
against his wish.
But he has one consolation, which
is that he has been made a deputy
sheriff to look after the quarantined
family, preventing the escape of any
or the intrusion of others.
