Into tho battle confident of the tri?

"A majority of votes were cas:

A" Cooper vote Is an anti-Blease vote.
Blease did not poll more than his nor

situation as two years ago. I started

COOPBR SUPPORTS MANNING
-1- I
Says He Can Best Serve His State by Aiding!
Governor to Re-election as
Chief Executive.
Robert A. Cooper, one of the Defeated Candidates for Gov?
ernor, Has Come Out in a Statement Saying That He Will
Support Governor R. I. Manning in His Race With Cole
L. Blease in the Second Pricnary.
IS'r. Cooper's statement, issued from'
his home in Laurcns, is as follows:
Vi 1
"I am deeply grateful to the many
I friends in all sections of the Stale
j who gave me their support in Tuee
' day's primary- Notwithstanding the
toyal support of true and tried
lrif nds, I have been defeated and the
second primary will be had with Gov.,
Manning' and Former Gov. Blease as
contestants. Among thdse who gave
me their support are former sup^
porters of these two gentlemen and
II am not unmindful of their prefer?
ences.
"I recognize the right of every
citizen to cast his ballot for the man
of his choice. I know, too, that 1
Ihave some friends who think I shoufd
make no statement at all at this
time and I respect their Judgment
, highly. Put 1 can not and do not pro
i 1
j pose to evade a stand for what I con
| .;eive to be the beat Interest of my
I State. Without attempting to give
j my reasons in detail, I believe I can
test serve my State at this time by
supporting Gov. Manning. A man in
public life should act according to the
dictates of his conscience and judg?
ment without regard to the effect
which his course may have upon n's
personal political fortune And should
a'so forget any wrong which may
have been done him when what he
conceives to be his duty to his ?tate
is at stake.
"I do not presume to dictate to
j the friends who voted for me. They
Aave a sovereign right to their bal?
lot. I make this statement as to my
telf for the reasons set forth above,
i and, further, that I may not be ac
< used of political cowardice or of
J sulking in my tent."

StWIS IMPORTANT BILLS.
WILSON PUTS HIS SIGNATURE TO
NATIONAL DEFENSE MEAS?
URES.
Speak* Briefly of What This Congress
Hus Done for Country's Safety.
Washington, Aug. 29.?President
Wilson today completed the adminis?
tration preparedness legislative pro?
gramme by signing the army and
navy appropriation bills. At the same
time he signed the Philippine bill.
The president also signed tho uniform
bill of lading bill. As he did so he was
surrounded by members of the senate
and house committees and army and
navy officers.
Moving picture cameras recorded
the event. After signing the meas?
ures, the president spoke briefly.
"I think that the whole country
will feel," said the president, "that
this congress has accomplished a very
remarkable part of the programme of
national defense. This bill that I have
signed for the army is merely the ap?
propriation bill, it is not the bill by
which we reorganized the army, of
course you understand, but it does
carry with it a very much needed re?
vision " of the articles of war, and it
does mean that the finances of the
nation are to stand behind the reor?
ganization of the army and its use
for adequate national defense.
"The navy hill is a very remarkable
measure. Never before by one single
act of legislation has so much been
done for the creation of an adequate
navy. Our navy has steadily grown.
I think tho development of that arm
of force has always had the enthu?
siastic support of the nation. It is a
matter of unusual gratification there?
fore, that we should have been able
at this time to do so much, to do it
so well, as I believe it to be done in
this bill, and to do it with such
unanimity of support and opinion.
"The Philippine bill excites pecu?
liar feelings in me, because there have
been times when the people of the
Philippines doubted our intentions to
be liberally just to them. I hope and
believe that this bill is a sufficient
earnest to 'th^'cvHrnr T^lnterrttons;'
It is a very satisfactory advance in
our policy of extending to them gen?
uine self-government and control of
their own affairs. It is only by such
mean.- that any people comes into
contentment and into political capa?
city, and it was high time that we did
this act of justice which we have now
done.
"The last bill, the bill of lading bill,
I believe, will be a most substantial
assistance to the right conduct of
both the commercial and financial
business of the country.
"So that it is with great gratifica?
tion that I am able to add my part to
so many pieces of useful and public
spirited legislation. I am not accus?
tomed to the kind of spot light to
which we have just been subjected,
but I am ycry glad to have been
caught at such acts."
The president said that the bills
probably would be momentous in
their results.

Mayor c O liana pol is Thinks His
State 4 ? k? Sale in Democratic
Kan*/ . /
Wf ton, Aug. 29.?There is an
old 1 ^ to the effect that "as In?
diana, nio and New York go, so will
the election"?in national affairs?
and while it is quite true that these
three States hold the balance of pow
? cr, right at this time these three
States are looking toward Wilson.
Every report that comes to the na?
tional capital from New York, Or.lo
and Indiana, and other of the big vote
centres indicates that Democratic
strength is increasing with every new
day and that the little enthusiasm
that came to light for Candidate
Hughes just after the Chicago conven?
tion is fast ebbing away.
Today E. C. Bell, mayor of the great
city of Indianapolis, was in Washing?
ton and expressed the conviction that
there would be a sweeping Wilson vic?
tory in Indiana this year.
"Mr. Wilson will carry the State
without a doubt," said Mr. Bell, "and
Tom Taggart will be returned to the
senate as surely as Frank Hanly, cs.n
I didate for president on the Prohibition
ticket, will be defeated. Mr. Taggart
is one of the most popular men in In?
diana. He is a born tighter, knows
every man, woman and child in the
State by their first names, and if there
is one thing the people out my way
admire, its a fighter. "He kept us out
of war. That is the biggest asset that
Mr. Wilson has. He will win in In?
diana on that issue alone. His Mex?
ican policy is in great favor with the
people, and his conciliatory attitude
toward the European belligerents la
praised equally as high.
"AS regards Mr. Justice Hughes'
trip through the West, I believe that
before he has completed his swing
around the circle, he will have con*
vinced the American people that Mr.
Wilson ought to be reelected. Inj
f the demise of the bull meoee^
re a ^t?at "many^'ProgreSsives in
diana who are still 'sore' at the tl
ment accorded them by the Republi?
can party, and not a few of them will
support the Democratic ticket. The
Republicans are In such a precarious
state that the leaders felt obliged to
call in all their speakers last week
in a final effort to find something
upon which they could base a tenable
campaign against Wilson.
"Indiana has never been more pros?
perous than it is today. There is
: plenty of labor for those who want to
work, and not enough workers for the
jobs. In the past employment agen?
cies have been trying to find jobs for.
men, now they are engaged in trying
to find men for the jobs. There has
not been a strike under my adminis?
tration, and I have been mayor for
three years."
