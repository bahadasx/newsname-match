"I yield to no one in the respect of i "I was very glad I,, ic, eive your
the sovereignty of .states, great or
small, for the inviolability of treaties,
for rights under international law, but
when we speak of the inv iolabilily of
small states and 'of their rights, what
have we to say with respect to the
course of the administration in San
lioniingo and Haiti, where today
nrined rule exists by our marines on
the soil of these states?
Assails President.
"We want in this countiy ptofes -
miiiis lo match practice. We want
ileeil.s lo match words and we want a
Mire policy which "ill protect 'he
liM'.s of American citizens."

"We should rescue husinei-s from
