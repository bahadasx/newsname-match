Will Sustain Him.

Asserts United States Will
Take a New Place Among
Nations When the Re

intprnntietrd News Service:
SHADOW LWVN, A S V. V It V
PA I IK. N. .1., Sept. Prost Wilson
this afternoon formally accepted the
democratic nomination for the pres
idenov. and mad- his first attack on
Charles K. Iliighe.s, chari"'-! that
he was making "doubtful and con
joetural promises of service." Also
he predicted a new place among
world powers for the United States
and declared this nation could never
rvmain neutral in the next bis war.
To prevent war, he advocated estab
lishment of a league for enforcing
peace.
The pre.-itient, before the commit
tee selected to notify him of his
nomination and a large number of
democratic leaders. leclarcl his he
lie? that the people of the United
States wish the democratic party to
remain in power because of tho
party's accomplishments and be
cause the republican party U "just
the party that cannot meet the new
conditions of a new age."
Doubtful laTOinlsos.
"I do not doubt that the people
of th United States wish tho lenio
cratic party to remain in control of
the povernment." he said. "They are
not in the habit of renting those
who have actually .served them for
those who are making doubtful and
conjectural promises of service.
Least of all are they likely to sub
stitute those who promised to ren
der them particular services and
proved false to that promise for
those wh have actually rendere!
fhse very services."
The president said the democratic
party not only fulfilled its own
pledges, but has enacted legislation
that th republicans had promised
to enact but had neglected. He matlo
a tail for support of the progres
sives by asserting1 that "we have in
four years come very near to carry
ing out the platform of the progressiva-
party as well as our own; for
we also are progressives."
Turning, to the position of th.e
United States todiy anions the world
powers and to the outlook for the
future, he said that th United
States could not r main neutral in
the next big war. In doing so. he
took the stand that "there must ho
a just and settled peace." before
there can be any real peace in Uu
rope. "We here in America must con
tribute the full force of our enthu
siasm and of our authority as a. na
tion to the organization of that
pe.ice upon world-wide foundations
that can not easily be shaken." ho
continued.
Nation Unanacted.
"No nation should be forced to
take ...ides in any quarrel in which
its own honor and integrity and the
fortunes of its own people are not
involved; but no ration can any
longer remain neutral as against any
wilful disturbance of the peace of
the world. The effects of war can
r.o longer be confined to the area
of battle. No nation stands wholly
apart in interest when the life and
interests of all nations are thrown
into confusion and peril. If hopeful
and generous enterprise is to bp re
newed, if the healing and helpful
; arts of life are indeed to be review
ed when peace comes again, a new
r. tmospp.-rv of justice and friendship
must be generated by means th.e
world has never tried before. Th
nations of the world must unite in
joint guarantees that whatever is
done to disturb the whole world's
life must first be tested in tlie court
ot the whole world s opin.-.-" before
it is attempted."
The pr'idfrnt's speech of accept
ance was made from the steps of the
summer white hou.e here, with his
audience on th.e lawn around him.
