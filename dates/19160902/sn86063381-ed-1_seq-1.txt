BRANDS REPUBLICAN
PARTY AS A FAILURE
Mires List of Sanguine Promises
Says That All Were Kept and
Redeemed.
(By United Press)
Long: Branch, N. J., Sept. 2.
President Wilson spoke for his re
election today. Before an immense
crowd massed over the beautiful
grounds of Shadow Lawn, the presi
dent accepted his re-nomination at
the hands of the Democratic party,
outlined the achievements of his ad
ministration and scored the Republi
cans as "a party of masterly inac
tivity, standing pat to resist change."
The Democratic party, the presi
dent said, holds to very definite ideals.
"We believe the energy and initia
tive of our people should be set free
as we have set them free and not
concentrated in the hands of a few
powerful guardians, as our opponents
^have again and again sought to con
mtrate them."
The day of "little Americanism,
with its narrow horizon, when meth
ods of 'protection' and industrial
nursing were the chiet studies of
our provincial statesmen,' are past
and done, he said.
The people, he said, would not re
ject "those who have actually served
them" for "those who are making
doubtful and conjectural promises of
service."
Outlining the legislative record of
his party, the president said the
Democrats have virtually created
commercial credit for the farmer,
liad given a veritable emancipation to
the working man, had released the
children of the country from "hurt
ful labor" and in addition to many
other things, had put through na
tional defense legislation greater
than ever "seriously proposed upon
the responsibility of an entire poli
tical party."
"And," he concluded in this dis
cussion, "we have come very near to
clearing up the platform of the Pro
gressive party as well as our own,
for we also are progressives."
The president said his policy was
/ouilt on two fundamental principles,
/chat property rights can be vindi
rt/oated for claims for damage, but the
.r' loss of life is irreparable.
"I neither seek the favor nor the
displeasure of that small alien ele
ment amongst us, which puts loyalty
to any foreign power before loyalty
to the United States," he said.
The president advanced his Mex
ican policy as an issue upon which
lie would stand in the face of any
criticism. While admitting the pos
sibility of mistakes "in this perplex
ng business," he flayed those who
would have recognized "the inspeak
able Huerta."
Tariff Revised.
"The tariff has been revised, not
on the principle of repelling foreign
trade, but upon the principle of en
couraging it, upon something like a
footing of equality with our own in
respect of the terms of competition,
and a tariff board has been created
whose function it will be to keep the
relations of America with foreign
business and industry under constant
observation, for the guidance alike
of our business men and of our con
gress.
"Th
lawsdefinition,trusts
against have been
^*arifiee by with a view to
making it plain that they were not
directed against big business but only
against unfair business and the pre
tense of competition where there was
none and a trade commission has
been created with powers of guidance
tind accommodation which have re
lieved business men of unfounded
fears and set them upon the road of
hopeful and confident enterprise.
"By the Federal reserve act the
supply of currency at the disposal of
active business has been rendered
elastic, taking its volume, not from

Recreation of Trade.
"Effective measures have been ta
ken for the recreation of an Amer
ican merchant marine and the re
vival of the American carrying trade
indispensable to our emancipation
from the control which the foreign
ers have so long exercised over the op
portunities, the routes, and the meth
ods of our commerce with other
countries.
"The Interstate Commerce commis
sion is about to be reorganized to
enable it to perform its great and
important functions more promptly
and more efficiently.
"For the farmers of the country
we have virtually created commer
cial credit, by means of the Federal
reserve act and the rural credits act.
They now have the standing of other
business men in the money market.
Child Labor Laws.
"We have effected the emancipa
tion of the children of the country
by releasing them from hurtful labor.
We have instituted a system of na
tional aid in the building of high
roads such as the country has been
feeling after for a century. We have
sought to equalize taxation by means
of an equitable income tax. We have
taken the steps that ought to have
been taken at the outset to open up
the resources of~Alaska. We have
provided for national defense upon
a scale never before seriously pro
posed upon the responsibility of an
entire political party.
"In foreign affairs we have been
guided by principles clearly conceiv
ed and consistently lived up to.
"We have been neutral not only be
cause it was the fixed and traditional
policy of the United States to stand
aloof from the politics of Europe and
because we had had no part either
of action or of policy in the influences
which brought on the present war,
but also because it was manifestly
our duty to prevent, if it were pos
sible, the indefinite extension of the
fires of hate and desolation kindled
by that terrible conflict and seek to
serve mankind by reserving our
strength and our resources for the
anxious and difficult days of restora
tion and healing which must follow,
when peace will have to build its
house anew.
Rights Involved.
"The rights of our own citizens of
course became involved that was in
evitable. Where they did this was
our guiding principle that property
rights can be vindicated by claims
for damages, and no modern nation
can decline to arbitrate such claims
but the fundamental rights of hu
manity cannot be. The loss of life
is irreparable. Neither can direct
violations of a nation's sovereignity
await vindication in suits for dam
ages. The nation that violates these
essential rights must expect to be
checked and called to account by di
rect challenge and resistance. It at
once makes the quarrel in part our
own.
"While Europe was at war our
own continent, one of our own neigh
bors, was shaken by revolution. In
that matter, too, principle was plain
and it was imperative that we should
live up to if we were to deserve the
trust of any real partisan of the rights
as free men see it. We have pro
fessed to believe, and we do .believe,
that the people of small and weak
states have the right to be dealt with
exactly as the people of big and pow
erful states would be. We have act-

ed upon that principle in dealing
with the people of Mexico.
No Violation.
"Our recent pursuit of bandits in
to Mexican tierritory was no violation
of that principle. We ventured to
enter Mexican territory only because
there were no military forces in Mex
ico that could protect our border
from hostile attack and our own peo
ple from violence, and we have com
mitted there no single act of hostility
or interference even with the sov
ereign authority of the Republic of
Mexico herself. It was a plain case
of the violation of our sovereignity
which could not wait to be vindi
cated by damages and for which there
was no other remedy. The authori
ties of Mexico were powerless to pre
vent it.

Much evidence has been gathered
since the county option election was

those who are concerned throw out
votes in precincts which went decid

It is alleged that among the alle
gations charged there will be those
of cases where minors, dead men and
absentees cast their votes.
The contention also is that the In
dian vote at the Red Lake agency
will be thrown out and a recount
asked in several of the precincts. It
may be possible that the entire coun
ty will be recounted. Attorneys H.
