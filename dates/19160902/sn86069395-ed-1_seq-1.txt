creases will have to be made by other
papers that cannot afford to, run at a

tion. Jackson, Republican, and Clerk
Keenbn, anti-Stanley Democrat, acted
together and Oldham, Democrat, was
"hitched outside" in making appoint
ments of county election boards.
Jackson snbmitted both lists. The
proceedings were in a private room.
Rodtr.on Keenon in allowing him
self to be controlled by the Republi
can Committee in his official appoint
ments is not the kind of Democrat to
be entrusted with authority. The
next legislature should make some
other officer the umpire on the elec
tion board, who will not play politics.
President E. P. Ripley, of the Atchi
son, Topeka & Sante Fe, Thursday
afternoon issued a statement to the
employees of the road, notifying them
that the positions of those who fail to
report for work next Monday will be
declared vacant and that the employ
ment of new men will be permanent,
barring ill behavior. Strikers will
lose all seniority advantages and pen
sion privileges along with their jobs.
Washington are loud in their praise
of Senator James, who put their pro

; amendment to the pending bill that
was adopted Thursday, granting all

Kincheloe was also very attentivo to
his constituents and showed them ev

MORE EMBARGOES ON
All Leading Roads of Country
impose Regulations' to
Meet Strike Labor Day.
Chicago, Sept. 1. Throughout the
entire country the railroads, great and
small have gathered their forces to
oppose the strike set for next Mon
day. A summary of the situation made
byE. P. Ripley, president of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, who
was a member of the committee which
conferred with President Wilson as
spokesman for railroad "presidents
who returned this afternoon from the
conferences at the national capitol, in
tensified the pessimism felt here.
Mr. Ripley asserted that the rail
roads can now see no hope of a set
tlement before Labor Day and are
making preparations to meet eventu
alities. ALL GIVE EMBARGO NOTICES.
Practically every important railroad
in the country gave notice of embar
goes, or was preparing to give them.
They affect passenger trains, perisha
ble freight and livestock. Agents ev
erywhere were instructed to warn
passengers of probable delays and not
to accept any perishable freight which
could nt normally be delivered be
fore Sept. 4. In some cases the date
was set for Saturday, the second, or
i Sunday.
Mr. Ripley's'face had fight written
all over it. Hd gave out three state
ments. The first statement was issu
ed formally as an expression of the
party which returned from Washing
ton; the second was addressed to em
ployes of the Santa Fe, and warned
those who.might obey the strike or
der that they would lose all rights of
seniority and of benefits from insur
ance and pension funds. The third,
was Mr. Ripley's plans for meeting
the strike and analysis of the rail-,
roads' side of the controversy. ,
BLAST OF DEFIANCE.
The three constituted an artillery
blast of defiance to the brotherhoods
to whose "unreasonable arrogance"
he attributed the situation.
There was some difference of opin
ion, he said, among the officials when
they first arrived in Washington as to
what course to pursue, but they be
came absolutely unanimous when re
quested to abandon arbitration. They
were for it, he said.
On the important subject of what
the roads propose to do he said that
attempts would be made to keep at
least one passenger train on each run,
and that preference would next be
given perishable freight.
He expressed the opinion that the
public would be surprised at the num
ber of men who would remain loyal
to their employers.
Legislation proposed by President
Wilson, he said, "seems not only ob
viously reasonable, but obviously ne
cessary." "The managements of the rail
roads,1' ho stated, "will proceed upon
the assumption that the strike will
come on Labor Day and will bo pre.
pared to act accordingly."

Greatest Interest In the "War
Is Now Focused on the
Balkans.
INVASION OF AUSTRIA
Breaks All Along the Carpa-
thian Line With Aus
trians Falling.
'London, Sept. 1. The whole inter
est in the war is now focused on the
Balkans and on the German field
marshal von Hindenburg. Ruman-
participation is -considered here
important not only from the accession
of a fresh army, but from the oppor
tunity it gives the Russian army to
extend its base and to co-operate with
Rumania on Galician and Transylvania
territory virtually as one army against
the Austrians.
Another important factor is the clos
ing of the Danube, the principal route
for the shipment of munitions from
Germany to Turkey and the shipping
of supplies to Germany.
Artillery is active on all the' battle
fronts of Europe but only on the
Transylvania-Rumanian border has
infantry been engaged to any extent.
Bad weather hampers operations in
France; Russians and Austro-Germans
on the eastern line arc resting as are
the entente forces and the armies of
the central powers in Macedonia and
the Austrians find Italians have yet to
renew their desperate fighting of a
week ago.
Along the whole line of the lower
Carpathians, the Rumanian armies
are . reported attacking the Austro-
Hungarian forces. The defenders are
said to have" retired 'to m'elrecond
fortified line.
Northeast of Kronstadt, the Austro
Hungarians have taken new positions
west of Czlk Szercde on the Atula
river, after fighting with the Ruman
ians. This shows that the troops of
King Ferdinand have broken through
the mountains on the eastern border
of Transytvania as well as on the
south.

WEATHER TOO WAS GOOD
For the Three First Days

Gave a Good
Start.
Great throngs poured in to the Pen
nyroyal Fair grounds yesterday and
last night and enjoyed the best pro
gram of the season. Traveling Men's
Day today, with a feature program
of special events in honor of the
traveling salesmen, will conclude the
fourth annual session of the fair.
The fair has been a greater success
than ever in all departments and ap
parently it has been more successful
financially than any season. Con? erv-
ative gucsscrs estimate the crowds at
little ovcr 3,000 a day while those
who are liberal in their figures say
that there have been over 5,000 each
day. .The fair officials have not given
out an figures on attendance.
Fridhv was children's dav and a
largo ilumber of young people at
tended. The program followed the
regular outline. All the county
schools now in session were given a

Adamson 8-Hour Measure
Only Postpone Issue.
HINT AT LEGAL FIGHT
"No Precipitate Action But
Illegal Measures Will Not
Be Allowed to Stand."
Washington, Sept. 1. Belief grew
in all quarters here last night that the
great railroad strike called for next
Monday morning would be averted.
At the close of a day of conferences
and hearings, congress apparently was
prepared to pass to-day or Saturday
the eight-hour day legislation which
heads of the employes' brotherhoods
have declared officially will cause
them to telegraph the code message
necessary to avert the strike order.
The bill will provide:
Au eight-hour day for trainmen in
interstate commerce, effective Dec. 1,
or Jan. 1, with the present ten-hour
rate of pay and pro rata overtime; and
A small commission appointed by
the president to investigate the work
ing of tht law from six to nine months
and report to congress.
This, with thedate Dec. 1, is in sub
stance the Adamson bill, revised by
Rep. Adamson and Democratic Lead
er Kitchin after conferring with Pres
ident Wilson and which A. B. Garret
son, spokesman for the brotherhoods,
stated would be considered a'"satis-
factory settlement" and prevent the
walkout.
ine senate interstate commerce
committee agreed to report on a sim
ilar bill with the date Jan. 1.
Passage by congress of the Adam
son compromise 8-hour bill probably
would postpone a trainmen's strike,
but it would not settle the matter,
presidents of three western railroads
declared. Furthermore such legisla
tion would be far from satisfactory to
the railroads, they said.
"The railroads would take no pre
cipitate action in event the bill were
passed," said Holden, president of the
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, who
was spokesman for the railway man
agers at the recent conferences with
President Wilson. "But we certainly
will not allow an illegal law to stand
if we can help it.
"It is my understanding that the
supreme court of the United States
has held recently, in two cases, that
the congress of the United States has
absolutely no power to fix wages.
That is what the Adamson bill amounts
to, according to my understanding.
"If it is passed it would only post
pone the issue."

Tobacco Embargo To Be
Resented By Uncle
Same.
JAMES SECURES ACTION
Following The Visit of The
Tobacco Men Mon
day. Washington, Aug. 31. A powerfu
blow in defense of the dark tobacco
growers of Kentucky and the other
producing States, was struck here to
day by Senator Ollie M. James, when
he obtained an amendment to the
Revenue Bill which places a club in
the hands of the President to strike
back at Great Britain or any other
country that seeks to impose restric
tions on American commerce similar
to the embargo on tobacco to Ger
many and Austria.
Germany Complicates.
Washington, Aug. 30. The export
tobacco situation, which' has engaged
the State Department and members of
Congress from Kentucky and other
States for several days, took a new
turn today.
Secretary of State Lansing an
nounced the receipt of a cable mes
sage from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin stating that the German Gov
ernment has issued an order prohib
iting the importation of tobacco.
This notice came to the State De
partment almost in the face of a new
protest to Great Britain against the
embargo on tobacco to Germany and
Austria, and added fresh complica
tions to the troubles of the dark to
bacco growers of Western Kentucky,
Tennessee, Virginia and Maryland.
Ambassador Gerard sent no expla
nation of the action of the German
Government. However, the restric
tion on tobacco is believed to have
been taken for economic reasons, as
tobacco is classed as a luxury.
EMBARGO TEMPORARY.
In trade circles here the opinion
generally was expressed that the Ger
man embargo will not be permanent
In the event that Great Britain lifts
her embargo it is expected that cer
tain amounts of tobacco will be al
lowed to enter the domaiij of the Cen
tral Powers by Germany.
Adoption of Senator James' amend
ment to the Revenue Bill was tem
porarily blocked in the Senate late
this afternoon by Senators Under
wood, of Alabama; Smoot, of Utah,
and Penrose, of Pennsylvania. They
asked for further time to consider it,
and the Kentucky Senator consented
to an additional day. He served no
tice that he would call it up for a vote
tomorrow. As the Democrats on the
Finance Committee approved the
amendment by a unanimous" vote
there is little doubt of its passage.'
GROWERS LEAVE CAPITAL.
Practically all of the tobacco Prow
ers departed for their homes todav.
iTheir leaders were more than pleased
at the results of the conferences here.
Th'ey were especially impressed v. th
their reception by Secretary Lansing
and left Washington firm in the bes
