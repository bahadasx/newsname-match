NEGRO EDUCATIONAL CONGRESS
Moit Successful Mtcling of
the Orgtnizition Held at
Washington, D. C.
Lait Week.
One hundred and fifty of the most
prominent Colored educators of the
United States came together Wednes
day at Metropolitan African lethod
1st Episcopal church, Fifteenth and M
streets northwest, for the opening ses
sions of the twenty-fifth annual con
vention of tho Negro National Educa
tional Congress, which will continue
through Saturday.
The gathering Is a most Important
one, and the subjects to be discussed
are of the most immediate interest to
all Colored citizens of tho country. In
struction In all branches as applied to
Colored persons, the courses which
should be prescribed and what devel
opment may be expected in futre as1 a
result of educational uplift will en
gross the attention of the delegates.
Another matter of great Importance
which will come up for debate, Is 'the
possibility of electing Colored men to
Congress. The opinion of the dele
gates, a brought out In yesterday's
symposiums, is that the election of
Colored representatives from Philadel
phia, Baltimore and St. Louis is feasl
hies, and perhaps one from a New
York district. The educators believe
that in the event of such .elections
Colored instruction throughout the
country would be better systematized
than now and that great benefit to
the race would result.
How to Increase Earnings.
II. F. Cheatham, former Represent
atlve from North Carolina, and now
superintendent of the Chllds Industrial
School at Oxford, N. C, delivered the
most important address of the open
ing sessions last night. His subject
was "How Can the Earning Power of
the Negro Race Be Increased?" He
brought out Interesting facts as to the
fine results achieved by practical ed
ucation in many cases and urged bet
ter adapted and more numerous
courses of instruction for Colored per
sons in the United States. Mr. Cheat
ham paid tribute 'to Booker T. Wash
ington and other well-known Colored
educators.
The 150 delegates were appointed
toy governors of the several states
and form a most representative gath
ering, coming from every section of
the country-
At the opening session yesterday
morning the president of the Con
gress, Prof. J. Silas Harris, of Mis
souri, was taken suddenly 111, and Dr.
Crossland, foreign minister and con
sul general to Liberia, called the meet
ing to order, and after brief remarks
Introduced Col. George T. Wasson as
the presiding officer of the session.
Miss M. M. W. Arter, of West Vir
ginia, acted as temporary secretary.
By unanimous vote of the Congress,

ka, was elected official reporter of
the meetings.
Some of the Addresses.
Addresses of welcome were deliver
ed bv the Rev. C. H. Stepteau and
Hiss Nannie H. Burroughs, president
of the National Training School for
Girls. Music was furnished by the
E. Azalia Hockley chorus; cornet solo
hy W. C. Chase, Jr.; organ voluntary,
Prof. William Braxton. Responses to
the addresses of welcome were made
toy Dr. J. R. A. Crossland of Missouri,
and Nelson C. Crews1 of Kansas City,
Mo. The latter struck the keynote
when he expressed his views as to
the methods to be taken to stem the
tide of oppression. He said: "
"Change the power of the source
and its effects of evil will cease."
Word was brought from the West
to the effect that residents of that sec
tion are awakening to the race's need
for a fair and square deal at the hands
of the nation's hand.
Henry P. Cheatham, In his address
on "How to Increase the Earning
Power of the Negro,"-' said the race
must make friends for Itself among
those of the other race, by being con
servative, gentle and friendly. In
stances were cited to show the good
that could be obtained. Further, he
said it was not a time for force and
arms, but rather peaceful and quiet
methods should be pursued; that Is,
stop and think as to the best way.
Thus can the problem be settled.
Visitors to tho congress include Dr.
J. A. Cotton, president of Henderson
Normal Institute, Henderson, w. .;
the Rev. David Johnson, of Washing
on. and others. The secretary, Mrs,
Julia Embry, of Colorado Springs,
Col., arived on an evening train.
Program for Thursday.
The sessions will be held at 10 a. m
2 p. m. and 8 p. m. At this morning's
session a special address will be de
livered by President Benjamin F. Al
len, of Lincoln Institute, Jefferson
City, Mo., on tho subject, "Where the
Emphasis Should Bo Placed la Mod
ern Education." Other topics to be
taken up for symposiums at the morn
ing and afternoon meetings are, "How
can the alarming death rate among
Negroes bo checked!" discussion led
by Dr. J. R. A. Crossland, and "Should
the education of tho Negro and white
youth bo Identical?1'
Comes Out for Hughes.
The .Negro education convention last
night adopted a resolution Indorsing
Hughes and Fairbanks, taking the
ground that "race progress baa even
been retarded under Democratio rUle,"
and hence that In order that their race
"may at least enjoy an equal chance
in the race for life," the.party now In
control must bo shorn of power,
Tho resolution, which was, reported
from the committeo on resolutions by
Dr. J, R. A. Crossland, the chairman,
was discussed at length earlier in the
day, but a vote on its adoption was
deferred until a larger attendance of
delegates could paBS on It. A spirited
discussion marked the proceedings,
but It finally was adopted without dis
sent. The resolution runs s follows: '
"Whereas the condition of the Amer
ican Republic has been made almost
intolerable In consequence of the Dem
ocratic misrule and graver than it has
been In the history of the government,
and,
"Whereas the continuation of that
party in power would threaten the ex
istence of our most cherished Institu
tions, and,
"Whereas tho splendid and patriotic
record of the race In peatfS and war
demands a fair chance.
"Therefore wo appeal to the patriot
ic men and women of the race to give
their united support to Hughes and
Fairbanks for. President and Vice
President of .the -United States. Not
for the purpose of taking from any
race of men their God-given immuni
ties of human endeavor, but that we
may at least enjoy an equal chance
In the race of life under the flag of a
common country."
Training for Colored Youth,
The question "Should the Education
of the Negro and White Youth Be
Identical" was taken up at the morn
ing session, Prof. J. E. Bonner, prin
cipal of Peabody School, Wilmington
N. C, leading in the discussion. He
was followed by J. B. Dudley, prest-
Prof. J. Silas Harris, one of the race's
foremost educators, and unanimously
re-elected In Washington last week
president of the National Negro Edu
cational Congress.
dent of Agricultural and Mechanical
College, Grensboro, X. C, who differed
from Prof. Bonner, saying that eacli
one had particular environments and
characteristics which must be trained
and cultivated.
Prof. Jayson, president of the State
College, Dover, Del., brought forth
cheers when he said: "Give the Negro
a chance as long as you can and as
full a training as you can. It is im
possible to teach a boy scientific ag
riculture until that boy has learned to
read and write. That Is, the founda
tion must first be laid, and for Indus
trial education the training is just the
same up to a certain point. Beyond
that point the boy or girl begins to
specialize and emphasis is given to
one line of work. Give him the best
start possible."
A resolution was offered by Col.
George T. Wasson to the' effect that
the congress indorse Hughes and Fair
banks for President and Vice Presi
dent, but after a lengthy discussion, a
substitute was offered. It was con
tended that tho aims of the congress
were too broad and too important to
allow politics to be injected. Nelson
Crews of Kansas City made an appeal
for the passage of tho original reso
lution, saying that all right thinking
Colored men believed in - it and fa
vored It. Because of an incomplete
roll of delegates a vote on the resolu
tion was deferred until a later "ses
sion. Address by 'Bishop Ross.
A distinguished visitor to the con
gress was Introduced in tho person of
Bishop I. N, Ross of tho A. M. E.
church. He made a short address, say
ing In part aa follows:
I assure you this has been very
refreshing to me. I have been so much
engrossed In my business that I have
employed two and three secretaries,
and I failed even to realize until this
morning that you were la session. I
feel that I owe It to myself to pay
respects to such a distinguished body
of educators and race builders.
"I have tho right as an American
citizen, who for 36 years has stood in
the forefront champipnlng the cause
of the rights of men, to say that out
of one blood God created all men to
dwell upon the face of tho earth, one
rule to regulate tho actions of men.
"Anything that savors of difference
or dlscrlnatlou Is a traversal or re
versal of tho principles Instituted by
tho King of Kings. Everything the
white man has the black man ought to
have. The only -way to solvo this ques
tion is, faith In God, right living, spi
nal column and manhood. Turn on the
headlight to find tho path of duty and
follow It unerringly to tho end. With

"WALKING THE DOG"
CRAZE
North Shore Folks of Fashion Accused of Start

MUST HAVE "CLEAN AND PROPER" DANCES
"Walkin' the dog," the new hoochy
koochy tango that the North Shore
sassiety folks stole from the "black
and tan" cabarets of South State
street, and other muscle dances en
gaged in by ladles of the smart set,
have fallen under the ban of the Amer
ican National Association of Dancing
Masters.
Further, the dancing masters ac
cuse the silk-socks of being responsi
ble for the craze for the "chemise
wobble" and other negligee dances,
which the police stop when cotton
socks try to imitate them in neigh
borhood dance halls.
The dancing masters last night ex-1
iciiueu an invitation to tne sassiety
muscle dancers to attend their next
convention and learn to dance prop
erly. Dancing -without moving the
feet Is not "proper dancing," say the
dancing masters. North Shore tango
hounds have not been interviewed on
whether or not they will accept the
Invitation.
In the announcement of the invita
tion sent to the smart set from the
Blackstone hotel, whero the dance
masters have been meeting, they say:
ilecognized social leaders will be
told just how they are directly re
sponsible for the toleration of many
of the Improper dances which have
Deen more or less in vogue lately. It
will be pointed out to them that no
dance, good, bad or Indifferent, is
considered, the proper thing to do
even In the Jowest'cabaret dance
halls, until society folks have pub
licly accepted It by allowing it to have
a place on their dance program."

"Walkin' tho dog" Is one of tho

their exercise in the district along
South State street bounded by 30th

There was a great roar from tho
reformers when the Herald and Trib

batch of kicks from the church and

didn't roar. Here was the promise
of a new thrill. The tango had lost its
speed. Nothing Intoxicating about it
any more for the wise Lady of Fash

out to South State street to look tho
new dance over. They tried it and
discovered the "kick" of a champagne
cocktail in It.
Then the Stratford hotel and other
loop dance parlors hired colored gents
to teach the dainty North Shore
ladles the queer muscle movements or
the new dance. The ladies begun
hopping like frogs. The new dance
was made. Meanwhile South Stato
