HUMPHREY FAILS
TO MAKE GOOD
HIS PROBE BLUFF
Up to noon Saturday, Congressman Will
E. Humphrey has failed to make good on his
&wn proposition.
r At Bremerton Wednesday night he said
he would furnish photographic copies of the
record to prove he did not influence the pur
chase of the "duck pond" postoffice site.
He said he would give $1,000 to any
charity The Star might name if The Star
could prove its charges.
He also said that he would withdraw
from the race when such charges were
proved.
Thursday night at Everett, Humphrey
named as the investigating committee the
following: Federal Judge Cushman, Su
perior Court Judges Frater and Ronald. He
said he wanted the investigation wide open
on all the charges.
The Star has accepted every condition
made by Humphrey.
, IT HAS ACCEPTED EVEN THE
JUDGES NAMED BY HUMPHREY, and
insisted only that the investigation be con
ducted in public. The Star offered to let
Humphrey name also the time and place
of the hearing.
But up to noon Saturday, Congressman
Humphrey has failed to put up his promised
$1,000.
He has failed to put up his written agree
ment to withdraw from the race when the
charges against him are proved.
He has failed to produce ANY photo
graphic copies of the record or anything
He has failed to notify HIS OWN COM
MITTEE OF JUDGES when and where to
meet.
In his speech at Burlington last night,
which drew a smaller crowd than United
States Sen. Poindexter had there two weeks
ago. Humphrey attempted to dodge out of a
public investigation.

ideals.
The day of "little Americanism,
»ith its narrow horizon, when
methods of 'protection' and indus
trial nursing were the chief studies
of our provincial statesmen," are
past and d' •. he said.
The peonies he said, would n't re
