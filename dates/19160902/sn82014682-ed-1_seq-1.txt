About 10 daya ago the StarBulle

net coming back from San Francisco,
' end that he was to be arrested by fed
eral offlcera of the 5an Francisco in
rpectora office, San Francisco being
headquarters of the postoffice inspec
tion division of -which Hawaii Is a
part The information was not used.
In order not fo hamper the efforts of
the authorities. :."
"Keohokalole was supposed to come
back on the Manoa next" Tuesday,"
ft Id Inspector Flavin, "but we had not
received definite word that he was
returning. I will probably get a cable
this afternoon if the news of the post
master's arrest ' is true. He added
that he has been working on the case
for the last three or four months, but
that as correspondence with the Japa--.
rese on Maul whom Keohokalole had
defrauded, was slow, the Investigation
1-ad not been fully completed.
Star-Bulletin Gave First News
On August IX the Star-Bulletin pub
lished the first Btory relative to Keo
hckalole'a' irregularities concerning
money orders. Issued to Japanese. The
flay before, August 10, a petition from
Japanese of Paia.. was received by
Japanese Contul-General Rokuro Mo
roi of this city, asking the consul to
take up the case with the postoffice
inrpectora. , .-' :' : . .
Six petitioners sent down heir re
ceipts, and declared that the money
tad never been received in Japan. The
dates of the missing orders run back
from a few months ago to as far back
as, July, 1915. The total amount the
Pata postmaster, is alleged to have
stolen-isclose to $1800.
Keohokalolo was one,of the Demo
cratic delegates to the national con
vention of the party in St Louis this
Hummer. He failed to return to the
islands with the others. It is said that
his bondiias postmaster was signed by
prominent Honolulu Democrats at the
timeie was appointed to the position.
From a reliable source this after
noon, I twas learned that Kaohokalole
embetzled the money as follows:
A Japanese would come to the post
office with say $600, and asJsXfor a
money-order for that, amount She
postmaster would give him a receipt
for $600 but would slater make out
the required duplicate copy of the
order for a smaller sum, and keep the
balance.- This duplicate would be
forwarded the Honolulu postoffice, the
onlyo one authorized . . by Japan t
handle money-order exchange.' The
exchange office here would forward
the sum called for In the. duplicate,
anywhere from 100 to $200.
When the Paia Japanese was noti
fied by the party in. Japan to whom he
sent the order, that only a small sum
had reached Japan, he complained to
the postmaster, who would tell him
he would write Japan to have, the loss
Investigated. As It would take two
months for the reply to return from
Japan saying the smaller sum was cor
rect Keohokalole "would "stall him
off" by telling him a mistake had been
made and he would take It up further.
In this way he stood off the Japanese
until he went to the mainland.
