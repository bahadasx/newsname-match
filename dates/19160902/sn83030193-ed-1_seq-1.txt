ACCEPTING RENOMINATION
the Displeasure of That Small
Alien Element Which Puts Loy
alty to Any Foreign Power Before
Loyalty to the United States."
By Samuel M. William.
(Special Staff Correspondent of The Evening World.)
WB8TT END, LONG BRANCH, N. J Sept 2. In front of the Bummer
Walte Home, looking out over terraced lawns and wondrous gardens,
tkronied with thousands of visitors, President Wilson this afternoon ao
Mfttd formal notification of his renomination and made a notable address,
wklek was frequently applauded.
He stood on a small platform built out In front of the broad veranda,
vltte his family behind him and leaders of tho Democratic) party In front
of htm.
Dark skies and a drlullng rain, which eArller In the day threatened
to mar tho ceremonies, had almost entirely disappeared by 1 o'clock, when
Members of the Democratic National Committee end other guests reached
Shadow Lawn. When the gates to the lawn were thrown open at 2 o'clock
the aun shone brightly.
President Wilson partly read and partly spoke offhand his speech of
acceptance, which becomes the keynote of the national campaign.
Senator Olllo James of Kentucky, -
Chairman of tbn Notification Com
mittee. In his address apprising the
President of his renomination mads
no effort to conceal his conviction
that tho Wilson Administration Is the
reateat Administration that ever
was. In his characteristically flowery,
but at tho same tlmo Impressive, way
Senator James revlowod President
"Wilson's record as an esccutlve and,
emetlmes, tho President was forced
to smile at the vehemence and sin
cerity of the nlo-iuont Kentucklan.
Senator Jamca vlowed nothing with
alarm. He did nothing but point with
pride. In bis peroration, he sold:
"Wnen peace hU spread her white
Wings over a charred und bloody
World, In the qulot of the chamber of
the Just historian, when tho din and
nei of, political antugonlsm shall
bare ceased, when tho prejudice and
passion of partisanship shall have
died away, when principle shall actu
ate men and parties rather than ap
petite, when ambition shall no longer
iure men and parties to unjust at
tack, the htstoilan will accord to you
a your administration foremost
place In the Ilopubllc'n life."
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS 'DONE
MERELY ITS DUTY.
The President, In accepting the
nomination, said:
"Boasting is always an empty busl
Bess which pleases nobody but the
boaster, and I hnvo "no disposition to
boast of what tho Democratic Party
has accomplished. It has merely dona
Its duty. It has merely fulfilled its
explicit promises.
7ho Republican Party was put out
of power because of failure, practical
failure nnd moral failure; beeauso It
had aorvod special Interests and not
the country at large; beeauso under
the leadership of Its preferred nnd es
tablished guldos, of thod who still
piake Its choices, It had 'oat touch
with tho thoughts anu is oi uio
Nation 'and was living In post ago
and under a fixed Illusion, l.o Illusion
Ct greatness."
Referring to tho accomplishments
f the Democratic Party during tho
administration, Mr. Wilson cited the
following:

of tho cave when It collapsed, was

the call, and with an old ahovol
started to dig Joe otit.
"Don't mind mo, mister," the llttlo
fellow sobbed. "Oct some help to dig

provides a fine of 3,000 or one year's
