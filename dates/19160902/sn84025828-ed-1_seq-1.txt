CONNERY CLAMPS
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are citizens who believe that
It la contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many of the
public offices In one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by , members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
the Counerys have on public affairs.
The result Is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wondor some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use the United States Gov
eminent in their business.
They evidently have found the
Stato of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions. J
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
lng why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be duo to the fact that there
are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerya First! ,
What a noble family motto that It
to be sure.
x And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerya aad their well
known hankering 'for'good'thlngs. "
"State Street Store" Blockl aa you
may have -heard him referred to, a
partner of John T. Connery In the coal
business, Is a member of the Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Blocki.
Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts in which the Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest In them
ver wholly died out
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our files will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1907 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
the light of tho Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
it not to all, of the Jobs in its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunno that Ilusse's gratitude was
great.
Whon John W. Ralnoy, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of tho Circuit Court
In 1912, tho Connery outfit fought
him nt tho polls In favor ot Joseph
K. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
Whon Robert M. Swoltzer was run
ning for the Democratic nomination
for Mayor In 1915, the Connerys saw
another chanco to put a member ot the
family in that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clork and now Comptroller of tho
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet of Connery and the noblo Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
wait for another chanco.
Swoltzer got the nomination and it
Is said that the Connery following
did not forglvo him for crowding out
one ot tho princes of the blood and
were not over-enthusiastic for Swelt
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law ot John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation tor Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present
efficient Democratic incumbent of that
office,

Unless tho sixty-seven teachertt
ousted from tho Chicago public
schools nro reinstated they havo
no chance ot ever getting pensions
from tho Chicago teachers' pension
fund. A joker In tho pension bill
passed by tho legislature three year!1
ago provides that no teacher shall
be entitled to a pension unless nho
has put In tho lust fifteen yours of
hor service exclusively In schools of
Chicago.
Thin, in the opinion ot I. T. Green
acre, counel for the Toachorit' Fed
eration, will make it impossible for
any of the ousted teachers to benefit
by the pension law, although many of
them have put In inoro thun twenty
years ot service In Chicago.
An effort will be made to have the
teachers reinstated when the board
ot education reconvenes Wednesday,
Eleven votes aro noedod to re-elect
and tho board stands about evenly di
vided as to the teachers, Tho death
of Charles Ffrench In New York has
cost the teachers one vote, Thero

reinstatement, nine against and two
who may be classed as doubtful.
Those two are Dr. Peter C. Clemen

DUNNE WILL LEAD
Popular Governor Will Head Democratic
Ticket and Will Be Renominated
at the Coming Primary.
Governor Edward F. Dunne will be
renominated by the Democrats at the
coming primary, September 13.
There Is very little opposition to
him, and this Is confined to disappoint
ed office seekers and chronic office
holders who never get enough.
Tho Governor's fine record spenks
for Itself and Is appreciated by tho
masses of the people.
Govornor Edward F. Dunno will bo
renominated by tho Democrats. In an
address to the public Just' issued, the
Governor cays:
"During the Forty-olghth general as
sembly, notwithstanding the fact that
tho Democratic members of both
houses were In a minority, I had the
satisfaction ot seeing twelve of tho
eighteen measures recommonded by
me placed upon tho statute books,"
the Governor declared.
Following Is tho list of twelve meas
ures which the Governor says were
placed on the statute books during his
administration:
Ratification of amendment to Fed-
oral constitution providing for election
of United States Senators by direct
vote ot the people
Tho Publlo Utilities Commission
law.
Tho law empowering all cities in the
Stato to own and operate public utili
ties. , The law authorizing employment ot
convicts on roads.
Tho law establishing an eplloptio
colony.
The law providing for rotation ot
names of candidates for stato offices
on ballots.
Tho law creating the legislative ref
erence bureau.
Tho law creating offlclency and' econ
omy committee.
The law amending the 2-cent rail
way fare act so as to mako it apply to
children.
The law creating a stato highway
commission and providing 'tor tho
building ot good roads.
The law compelling corporations to
pay wages semi-monthly.
,
Tbo law consolidating tho fish and
game commissions and reforming the
abuses of tho old separato commis
sions. "In 'addition to tho above," tho state
ment adds, "t took pleasure In further
ing the passage of and signing the bill
known as the workmen's compensa
tion act, which revised the law of 1911,
and which provides, without litigation,
compensation to Injured employes for
Injuries sustained In the course of
their employment.
"Likewise during my administration
tho Forty-eighth general assembly
passed coal mining laws providing for
greater safety In mining operations
and tho establishment of rescue sta
tions. It also passed the electric head
light bill and other remedial legislation."
PEOPLE ARE
WITH H0YNE
State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne Is
out with a statement announcing his
candidacy for re-election. His plat
form Is to bo, he asserts, the record of
his achievements during tho last four
years, and on this record ho asks the
voters to assist him. His statement
follows:
"I havo decided to bo n candidate
for re-election as stnto's attorney, and
to that end shall seek a renomlnatlon
from the Democratic party at the
September primary.
"This conclusion results chiefly
from tho advice and assurances ot
support I have received from over
1,000 citizens of different -political par
ties, who aro leadors In business, la
bor, professional and civic affairs.
They Inform mo they will soon elect
officers and organizo for an enorgetic
campaign.
"I regret that tho existing election
laws make it necessary for candidates
for State's Attorney and other muni
cipal offices to seek a partisan nomin
ation. National politics and policies,
and politics generally, should havo not
tho slightest connection with tho of
fice ot State's Attorney and such of
fices. Since the election In 1912 I
havo conducted the State's Attorney's
office on this theory. Upon the rec
ord mado during this period I stand.
"I ask tho aid and votes of tho vot
ers of the Democratic party at .the
September primary upon that record,
regardless ot their previous factional
connections, sympathies or activities.
"My determination to bo a candi
date is and will remain, unaffected by
tho action, desires or wishes ot any In
dividual, or group ot Individuals, as
suming to give orders to tho mass ot
tho party voters ot this county or to
myself.
"I feel It necessary to soy this be
cause ot silly nowspnpor artlclos to
tho effect that cortaln Democratic
leadors wore organizing a local 'Tain
ninny,' and Hint candidates for party
nominations In this county would bo
compelled by n pledge to turn over the
power of appointment and other
patronngo of tho offices tlioy sought to
homo committea or group ot leudors,
"I novor havo nor will I over sign,
give or mnko such a pledge, or nny
pledgo whatovor othor than that I
mako in public to tbo voters ot Cook
County. I disclaim any intention or
doslre, singly or Jointly, to Tammany
Izo nny official or prlvato cltlzon, and
I kuow that I will pormlt no ono to
fnmlllnrlzs mo or any offlco I ever
hold or hope to hold."
"I recognize," ho said, "under tho
existing election laws, tho legality and
propriety ot each political party choos
ing a county control commltteo, and
that committees havo cortaln powors
and dutlos to perform.
"Although tho nomination of candi
dates for State's Attorney and county
officers generally Is not ono ot the
functions of the county central com
mltteo, and although Us Indorsement
or falluro to Indorso binds nolther tho
voters ot the party nor the candidate,
I realize tho county central commit
tee, through its reorganization, can
glvo greatest aid to a candidate for
nomination.
"Having this In mind, and subject to
what has been said above, I shall seek
tho aid and Indorsement of my candi
dacy for nomination from the present
duly olocted county central commltteo
of the Democratic party, and hopo,
upon my record In offlco, I may recolvo
it.
"I havo rotcrrod to my record In of
fice, so in conclusion lot me say that
this record Is not one ot drastic, harsh
and relentless prosecutions. No pub
llo official or private citizen, minister,
priest or rabbi ever asked leniency or
mercy for tho young, Ignorant, poor
or misguided first offender In vain. It
Is to the habitual criminal and be
trayer of public trust alono that a deaf
ear has been turned."
