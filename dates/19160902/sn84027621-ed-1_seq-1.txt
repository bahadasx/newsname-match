Mil VIGOROUS
TEHMS HE DENOUNCES THE REPUBLICANS AS LACKING INITIATIVE AND UNABLE
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 2. Dem
ocrats from all parts of the country
flocked here today for ceremonies at
tending the notification of President
Wilson of his re-nomination. Cabinet
members, s senators, representatives
and other democratic leaders headed

House, kept in touch "with the strike
legislation situation.
ADDRESS OF ACCEPTANCE
'Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 2. Pres
ident Wilson formally accepted his
rtnomination here this afternoon with
an addrdss recounting the legislative
record of the democratic party, a vig
orous defense of his Mexican policy,
his dealings with the European bel
ligerents and an outline of his view
of America's obligations for the fu
ture. REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A BACK
y NUMBER
With themembers of the notifica
tion committee headed- by Senator
James grouped about him at Shadow
Lawn, the summer White House, the
president declared the republican
party was "just the party that can
not meet the new conditions of a new
age" and that the day of little Amer
icanism when "methods of 'protection'
and industrial nursing were the chief
study of our provincial statesmen"
was past and gone.
WE MUST PLAY OUR PART
"We can no longer indulge our tra
ditional provincialism" said the pres
ident. "We are to play a leading part
part in the world drama whether we
wish it or not. We shall lend, not
borrow; act for ourselves, nor imi
tate or follow; organize and initiate,
not peep about merely to see where
we may get in."
EUROPEAN COMPLICATIONS
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia
tions with the European belligerents
the president followed a declaration
that while property rights might be
vindicated by claims for damages, the
' loss of life and fundamental rights
of humanity never could be, with this
statement:
"The record is clean and consistent
throughout and stands distinct and
definite for anyone to judge who
wishes to know the truth about it."
AMERICANS FIRST
Immediately afterward he said:
"I am the candidate of a party, but
I am above all things else an Amen
can citizen. I neither seek the favor
nor fear the displeasure of that small
alien element amonerst us which puts
loyalty to any foreign power before
loyaltyto the United States.
MEXICO
Regarding his Mexican policy the
president reiterated that the people
of Mexico were struggling "blindly it
I may be and as yet ineffectually," to
free themselves from alien interests
"some of them Americans pressing
for things they could never have got
in their own. country" and that he
would do everything in his power to
prevent anyone standing in their way.
"It is hard doctrine," said he, "only
for those who wish to get something
for themselves out of Mexico." At
another point the president said:
"Mistakes I have no doubt made in
this perplexing business but not in
purpose or object." He declared at
.another point:

BUSINESS ISSUES
At the outset of his references to
the legislative achievements of his
party the president enumerated the
aws placed on the statute books re
ating to business including tariff re
vision, anti-triist laws, revision of the
banking and currency system, rural
credits, rehabilitation of the merchant
marine and creation of the Federal
Trado Commission.
"What other party has understood
the task so well or executed it so in
telligently and energetically?" he
asked. "What other party has at
tempted it at all? The republican
eaders apparently know of no means
of assisting business but protection.
How to stimulate it and put it upon
a new footing of energy and enter
prise they have not suggested."
At the conclusion of his review of
the party record the president de
clared:
"This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of san
guine promises but it is not. It is a
record of promises made four years
ago and now actually redeemed in
constructive legislation." Then, later
he said: "We have in four years come
very near to carrying out the plat
form of the progressive party as well
as our own; for we are also progres
sive." The president's address was some
five .thousand words long, one . of the
most lengthy he has delivered on any
occasion since taking office..

With the Distribution of Blooded
Stock tothe Pig Club Boys
, of Marion County
With the distribution this morning
of the Hampshire hogs to the pig club
boys a new era was begun in this
county.
"This step on the part of Marion
county will be heard of throughout
the country," said Mr. B. F. William
son of Gainesville, who drove to
Ocala in his car to be present at the
distribution of the hogs. . Mr. Will
iamson, who is a member of the firm
of Williamson & Dennis, thinks Mar
ion county is taking a most import
ant step in its movement for one
breed of hogs.
MrfcC. K. McQuarrie, state agent
of farm extension work, A. P. Spen
cer, district agent of extension work,
G. L. Harrington, state agent of
boys' clubs, and Dr. A. H. Logan, field
agent of the bureau of animal indus
try of the United States department
of agriculture, came from the experi
ment station in Gainesville to see the
Hampshires. They were all mighty
well pleased with the animals.
The boys drew lots for the hogs.
Each hog has a number, name and its
history. After the selection the work
of crating the animals began. Most
of the boys drove in from the coun
try and are taking their gilt or sow
home in a wagon. Others are ship
ping by express. .
Many have viewed the Hampshires
since their arrival.
The list of boys getting" hogs is as

Stocked Up
Unless the railroad strike is called
off, it will begin at 6 o'clock Monday
morning. The men on the trains
which are on the road at that time
will take them thru to the terminals.
This will include A. C. L. No. 10,
which leaves here at 5:40 a. m., and
the Coast Line and Seaboard trains

ville, Tampa and St. Petersburg. 1
MARION HAS MOVED
The prospects of this strike show
that Marion county and Ocala have
moved forward considerably in twen
ty years. A score of years ago a
strike would have meant starvation.
So far since then has farming and
stockraising progressed that it will
only mean inconvenience.
OCALA IS NOT UNPREPARED
If a strike comes on Monday it will
find Ocala well prepared. Many other
cities will find it more difficult b
withstand the hardships of a railroad
tie-up. There is a good supply of
foodstuffs here. The light and water
plants can run as long as the supply
of lubricating oil lasts, and the gas
plant is prepared to give service for
six weeks. The Ocklawaha Valley
railroad will continue to operate its
trains between here and Palatka, and
will interchange freight with the
Clyde steamers; so that Ocala can get
in supplies from the outside, jf -the
outside is prepared to furnish the
supplies.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF WOOD
Superintendent J. C. Caldwell of
the light and water plants, said this
morning, when asked for the infor
mation, that the two plants could
continue in operation as long as lu
bricating oil is available. He has
enough oil on hand to keep the light
plant going for thirty days, and has
placed an order with one of the dis
tributors here for an additional sup
ply. There is enough oil on hand to
keep the water plant going six
months. Mr. Caldwell thinks that
there will be no shortage of packing.
Neither plant uses coal. The light
plant is operated with wood as fuel,
and the pumps at the water works are
operated with current from the light
plant. The steam pumps at the wa
ter works have not been used for
about three weeks now, but in case
of necessity the steam pumps can.be
used, the boilers at the water works
using wood also. There is enough
wood on hand at the light plant to
last from 20 to 30 days, and more
can be hauled in from the woods.
GAS PLANT CAN KEEP GOING
C. W. Hunter, general manager of
the gas company, said this morning
that he would be able to supply gas
for at least six weeks. A car of coal
and a car of oil have just been re
ceived at the gas plant.
OCALA HAS ONE RAILROAD

S. P. Hollinrake, superintendent of
the Ocklawaha Valley railroad, said,
when seen, that the crews on his road
would not be affected by the strike
