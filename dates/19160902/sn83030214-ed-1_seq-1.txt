Alabama Senator Offers Amendment Oiving
Commerce Board Power to Fix Wages for
Railroad Employes of All Classes.
From a Staff Coireapendetlt of The Trihunc]
Washington, Sept. 1.?Goaded by a pgoiiolike fear, Con?
gress acted to-day to avert tho nation-wido railroad strike that
will begin next Monday morning unless the four train service
brotherhoods get a law estabHahing an eight-hour btuk day.
The House of Representativrs pasaed late this afternoon, h.\
a vote of 259 to :;<;. an emergency bill Introduced b) Chairman
Adamson. of the Committee on [nterstate and Forefgl. Com?
merce. making eight hours the standard of a day's work for
measuring the compensation of all employes engaged in train
service.
The measure also create? a commission of three to in
vestigate the operation of the eight-hour schedule and to report
inside of ten months. It provides. too. that pending the report
of this commission the train servire employes shall receive the
present ten hours' pay for eight hours' work and pro rata pav
for overtime beyond eight hours.
The Senate, having spent all afternoon discussing a aimilar
bill with radieal addition, fostered by Senator Cndcrwood. of
Alabama. dropped its own measure to-night and took up the
House bill. Senator Underwood immediately olTered thn former
addition to Ihe Senate bill as an amendment to the House bill.
