C. L. Young Submits Brief to the
Federal Board at Fargo
Yesterday,
BISMARCK CENTRAL TO
DISTRICT ADVOCATED
Fargo Seeks to Have Minnesota
Made Part of the Proposed
Territory.
•C. L. Young, president of the Com­
mercial club P. E. Byrne and Ralph
Ward
(returned
last evening from
Fargo, where they presented Bis­
marck's bid for the farm loan bank
before the federal farm loan board,
which was in session there all day.
The members of the board passed
through Bismarck last evening on a
private car attached to iNo. 1, enroute
for Helena, Mont., where the next
hearing will be held.
.Mr. Young presented a written
brief and elaborate exhibits in sup­
port of Bismarck's claim for consid­
eration. iB'ismarck and Minot sup­
porters asked the inclusion of 'North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana
in one district. This would make
Bismarck central and an appropriate
place for the new institution.
Fargo, however, advocated the cre­
ation of Minnesota, North and South
Dakota in one district with Fargo as
the home of the new farm loan bank.
If iMinnesota is included most pre­
dict the bank will go to St. Paul.
iMr. Young in supporting his con­
tentions for a district comprising
North and South 'Dakota, Montana
and Wyoming, declared that econom­
ic conditions were similar in this sec­
tion, that the agricultural develop­
ment in general was the same and
that the district is generally served
by the same railroad facilities.
He summed up the reasons why
Bismarck should be located, as fol­
lows:
"Bismarck is the center of such a
district as has been mentioned.
Increasing Demand.
"It is the experience of the state
in loaning its public institution and
school funds that there is an increas­
ing demand In the western part of
the state as compared with the east­
ern part.
"There are adequate railroad facil­
ities to bring Bismarck in touch with
all parts of the district.
"There are nearly one-half million
acres of public lands unentered, as
shown by Circular No. 420 of the de­
partment of the interior. This is
nearly all in the western part of the
state.
Much Vacant Land.
"There are still 1,641,697 acres of
school and institution lands awaiting
the settler and a large part of these
are in the western part of the state.
"The conditions as to the settle­
ment of public lands are the same in
Montana, in which there are unenter­
ed, as shown by the foregoing report,
19,000,000 acres of public lands.
"The same is the situation in Wyo­
ming, where there are 30,000,000
acres.
Interest Rates.
"While the interest rates through­
out the district are high as compared
with the rates in other sections of
the United States, the percentage
paid for interest and commissions in­
creased as one moves westward in
the district.
"The newer section of the district
we have proposed is in the western
parts of North Dakota, South Dakota
and in eastern Montana and Wyo­
ming. The area of development in
these sections has just begun. The
demand for capital is therefore great.
"All of the territory mentioned is
within a radius of 400 miles of Bis­
marck.
Has the Advantage.
"Bismarck has the advantage of be­
ing the state capital. In the office
of the state engineer are assembled
the records of the now abandoned sur­
veyor general's office, which would be
of incalculable value in determining
the desirability of lands as security
"Bismarck is rapidly developing
and is a distributing center for a
large part of this area and especially
that portion of it in which the de­
mand for capital and farm loans is
greatest.
"The population of western North
Dakota has increased with great rap­
idity during the past two decades.
A similar condition prevails as to
the increase of population in eastern
Montana and western South Dakota

MY BRIEF
Grecian Ruler Enjoyed Period of
Remarkable Popularity While
in Power.
WAS GREAT FACTOR IN
WELFARE OF GREECE
London, Sept. 1.—The reign of Con­
stantine I as king of the Hellenes was
brief, dating only from March 18,
1913, when ihs father, George I., was
assassinated in Saloniki.
Brief as the reign was, Constantine
has enjoyed a period of remarkable
popularity and increased the territory
of the Greek monarchy by over fifty
per cent.
Born on August 3, 1868, he was edu­
cated largely by private tutors from
Leipsic, which was said to have
stamped upon him a permanent Ger­
man influence. His military educa­
tion was furthered by attendance at
manoevures in Germany. He became
a brother-in-law of the German Em­
peror by marrying the latter's sister,
Princess Sophia, in 1889.
His alleged pro-German leanings,
thus indicated, were not. always popu­
lar with his people, and during the
European war a strong party antago­
nistic to his desire to have Greece
preserve neutrality and in favor of
joining the Allies, precipitated a cab­
inet crisis which was weathered with
difficulty.
The most interesting chapter of
Constantine's life fs the way in which
he became the people's idol. Like his
father, he had his ups and downs in
favor, the Greeks having been quick
changing in their likes and dislikes.
In 189G when he saw his country drift­
ing into war with Turkey, he sound­
ed a warning that the Greek army
was utterly unprepared for a cam­
paign. The infantry was armed with
condemned 'French rifles, which had

IZLZUTHERIOS VENIZELOS
Venteeios, former premier of
Greece, has opposed King Constan­
tine on the question of war. He has
insisted on co-operation with the A1
lies and resigned twice in two
months ibecause of the king's insist­
ence on peace.
Reported That King Constantine
Had Abdicated and Crown
Prince Will Be His Successor.
London, Sept. 1.—Unofficial dis
patches reaching London, which have
been much censored, indicate that
Greece has abandoned neutrality and
thrown her lot on the side of the En­
tente allies. Whether Greece has al­
ready declared war is problematical,
as is the nation or nations to whom
she has thrown down the gauntlet.
It is reported King Constantine has
abdicated and the crown prince has
been named as his successor, with
former Premier Venizelos as the pow­
er behind the throne. The British
foreign office says it has no confirm
ation of the king's abdication.
Postpone Election.
An Entente fleet of 2 warships and
seven transports is reported off Prie
aus, the port of Athens. A dispatch
from Athens says it'is probable that
the Greek election, set for October
8, will be postponed for a fortnight.
The Greek garrisons at Saloniki
and Vodena and at Fort Little Kar

donia, according to dispatches from
Salonifli. The revolt in Saloniki is
confirmed by the British foreign of
fice. Greeks, friendly to the Entente,
surrounded the barracks of the Greek
infantry in Saloniki and are said to
have engaged with them. General
Sarrail, Entente commander at Salon­
iki, intervened to prevent further
bloodshed.

Kansas City Official Charged With
Irregularites With Govern­
ment Funds,
POSTOFFICE INSPECTORS
CHECK UP PROPERTY
Ousted Man Claims Their Is
Nothing Amiss Says He Is
In Right.
Kansas City, iMo., Sept. 1.—Post
office inspectors tonight were check­
ing over the property of the Kan&as
City, Kan., postoffice, following the
removajl today of rWiUtam Firsten
berger as postmaster.
Alleged irregularities charged by
the government, as explained by Mr.
Firstenberger, grew out of a check of
$1400 which he had deposited to the
postoffice's account.
"When postoffice inspector visit­
ed the office," he declared, "I made
a statement of the office's financial
condition. I already had turned over
a note for $1,000 to the bank to be
discounted, which would have made
my total account $1,400. I supposed
it had been discounted, and placed to
my credit, and accordingly, made out
a check to the postoffice for $1100,
payable to myself. It was returned,
marked 'not sufficient funds.' Upon
inquiry, I learned the note had not
been disounted, due, I am told, to
the fact that the 'board of directors,
which was to have 'passed upon the
note, had not met.
"Within an hour, I discounted the
note, and made good the money.
Government inspectors, however, re­
fused to deliver to me the check the
bank had turned down, and took the
matter up offlially."

Wilson Tendered an Enthusiastic
Reception on Arrival at
Long Branch, N. J.
SAYS HE IS GLAD TO
BE BACK IN "JERSEY"
Will Receive Formal Notification
of His Renomination To­
day.
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 1.—Pres
dent Wilson was enthusiastically wel­
comed to his summer home here when
he arrived tonight for the formal not­
ification of his renomination tomor­
row.
A crowd of more than 500 persons
were gathered at the station to re­
ceive the president on his first real
home-coming to New Jersey since he
entered the White House. Buildings
were draped with flags and the town
was in holiday mood. Mr. Wilson was
on the observation platform of the
train and cheering and handclapping
broke out as the crowd caught sight
of him.
An automobile parade followed the
president's car to Shadow Lawn.
There a reception committee was
waiting. The president declared he
was glad to be back in "Jersey."
For thirty minutes Mr. and Mrs.
Wilson remained on the broad veran­
da shaking hands with residents, and
then they entered the house.
VILLA'S BROTHER HELD
BY U. 8.
El Paso, Sept. 1.—Hiplioito Villa,
brother of Francisco Villa, and his fi

riod of power, is now,in the custody
of the United States authorities, It
was learned here today. Both civil
and military authorities observe a
secrecy as to the circumstances of
the arrest and the place of confine
ment and charge against him.
It is known Villa came here some

the town, and was arrested by United
States soldiers on the border, twelve
miles east of here.
HUGHES ILL RLCEIVtD
Topeka, Kan., Sept. 1.—Charles E.
Hughes, speaking at the Capitol
grounds to a crowd that stood through
a shower to listen today, declared the
protection for which he stood was
more than protection in a commer­
cial sense to American business, but
embraces protection of American
rights on land and sea, of national
peace, and of industry and efficiency
of government.
"I stand for protection in a com­
prehensive sense," Mr. Hughes said.
"I do not speak either of protection
or of preparedness in a narrow or
limited way. I use the word to em­
brace all that is needed to foster and
promote American enterprise, and to
better our conditions."
The nominee said he placed first, "a
firm insistence upon all American
rights on land and sea."
Mr. Hughes repeated the charges
made at Salina earlier, that the pres­
ent administration has been more ex­
travagant than any other in the his­
tory of the country.
"Only the other day, a Democratic
senator said that
$20,000,000
should
have been saved from the rivers and
harbors bill this year," Mr. Hughes
said.
Half of the audience were women.
One thousand women, members of
the Kansas Hughes Alliance welcom­
ed the nominee on his arrival at the
grounds.
Three cities today presented their
claims to the federal land bank board
in session here to get information on
which to base its selection of the city
at which one of the farm loan banks
will be located.
It is proposed to create a district
made up of the states of North and
South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota

BY JUL HEADS
Officials Believe Strike Has Been
Averted and Revoke Noti­
fications.
STILL PREPARED IN
CASE OF WALKOUT
Chicago, Sept. 1.—Convinced that
congress will force them to surren­
der, presidents of important western
railroads tonight ordered rescinding
of notification of the freight embar­
go, established in preparation for a
general railway strike. At the same
time the railroad executives announc­
ed defections from the ranks of the
railway brotherhoods, and declared
they had enough men to operate
trains, .strike or no strike. -This was
denied by brotherhood officials.
Hale Holden, president of the C.,
& Q. railroad, spokesman for the
railroads in the conferences with
President Wilson, said the railroads
are convinced congress will force
through the eight-hour day law be
fore the date set for the strike, but
that they are taking no chances.
"It seems tonight that congress
will make us surrender," iMr. Holden
said, explaining an order by his
freight department revoking the em­
bargo. "The Burlington and other
roads have felt today there is little
chance for a strike now. We are
revoking our embargo so as not to in­
convenience the shippers at all. But
we are going ahead with our plans to
operate trains in event of a strike.
The strike order must be actually re­
voked before we let up in our pre­
cautions. We have men enough to
run trains."
Modifications of the freight embar­
go were announced today by the
Eric and the Rock Island systems.
Other roads were expected to take
similar action within a few hours.
While the railroad executives were
claiming defections of thousands of
brotherhood members, officials of the
union, through Timothy Shea, vice
president of the 'Brotherhood of En
ginemen, said the railways habitu
late such stories and they have no
fears their men would not obey the
strike call.

ISSUE PASSED HOUSE
BY LARGE MAJORITY
Believed Code Message Will Be
ent Out at Once Countermand
ing Walkout Order.
Prevention of the threatened rail*
road strike through an act of congress
seemed assured tonight after the
house had passed the Adamson eight*
hour day law by an overwhelming
vote, and the senate had agreed to
take a final vote on the measure, not
later than six o'clock tomorrow eve*
ning.
Although it is possible that senate
amendments may make conferences
necessary, it is generally believed op
both sides of the Capitol that, when
the test comes, the house bill, as It
stands, will be accepted and lushed
to Shadow Lawn, N. J., for Presi*
dent Wilson's signature. While no
formal announcements were forth*
coming from the employes' brother*
hood heads tonight, it is authorlta*
tively stated that this will result in
immediate dspatch of code message's
calling off the general strike ordered
for Monday morning.
Bill Passed toy Big Majority.
The Adamson bill, as It wis passed
in the house, by a vote of 239 to 36,
with minor amendments, is the .SUM
measure which the brotherhood lead*
ers officially declared yesterday would
constitute a 'satisfactory settlement,"
and prevent a strike. The amend*
ment added to conform to a draft
framed by the senate interstate com*
merce committee would fix the effec­
tive date January 1, 1917, instead of
December 1, 1916, and exempt rail*
roads less than 100 miles long and
elctric street and interurban lines.
Briefly, it provides:
Provisions of Bill.
That eight hours shall be deemed a
day's work, and the standard for Teck*
oning compensation of railroad em*
ployes operating trains in interstate
commerce after, January 1, 1917, and
That a commission of three, ap­
pointed by President Wilson, shall in*
vestigate the effects of the eight-hour
standard from six to nine months,
and then report to congress, present
wages not to be reduced during the
investigation, or for thirty days there*
after, and overtime to be paid at a
pro rata rate.
It was after a day of hot debate
that the house passed the bill, under
a special rule brought in when Re*
publican Leader Mann objected to its
consideration. Less than half of the
Republicans followed their floor lead­
er in the opposition and* when the
final vote came, seventy of them lined
up with the majority, while only fifty*
six voted against the measure.
Just two Democrats, Representa*
tive Steel of Pennsylvania, and Black
of Texas, stood out against the bill,
and Representative London of New
York, the only socialist, Toted for It.
Red Tape Eliminated.
Red tape was eliminated as far as
possible to rush the measure orer to
the senate which, after several hours
of lively discussion over a bill report*
ed by its interstate commerce com­
mittee, had recess until eight o'clock.
When the senate convened the house
legislation was there awaiting action.
The senate committee bill, drafted
during a late session iMt'nighti and
another this morning, was the Adam*
son measure, with the same amende
merits adopted today by the house,
and an added section empowering the
interstate commerce commission to
fix the wages of interstate railroad
employes at the end of the proposed
period of investigation and thereafter.
At the outset of the night session.
Senator Newlands sought and ob­
tained unanimous consent to put
aside the senate bill and take up the
one sent over from the house, there*
by paving the way for quick final ac­
tion, without parliamentary formali­
ties that otherwise would be neces­
sary. Then Senator Underwood
brought up the issue, over which the
senate is divided, by proposing as an
amendment, the rate-fixing provision
of the discarded senate bilL
Over this amendment, debate wag*
ed for three hours, Senators New*
