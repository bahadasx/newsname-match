the Greek capital was completely cut
off from the world.
Just before midnight two dispatches
came through, bearing today's date,
from Athens.
One was from the correspondent of the
Exchange Telegraph Company, and said
that thirty ailied warships. accompanied
by transports, had arrived off Piraeus, the
port of Athens. Part of the ships are re
ported lying in Salamis and Phaleron

The other dispatch announced the post
ponement of the Greek elections. Neither
touched on the question which holds Lon

fever of interest-what is the fate of
King Constantine?

It was sent without comment at its

Coupled with it was the report that
Crown Prince George had ascended the
throne, with former Premier Venizelee

Pershing Warned to Watch For Pos
sible Attack.
(By the Internatieal News Service.)
El Paso. Sept. .-Francisco VIlla has
crossed the Mexican Northwestern Rail
way west of Chihuahua City with M men
and in now within aitp" miles of the
southern outposts of Gen. Pershing's ex
pedition. . Gen. Pershing has been warned
of his approach.
This information was given out today at
army headquarters here. Whether Villa
has turned eastward to cut the railroad
between Chihuahua and the border or is
pushing north to attack the punitive ex
pedition outposts is a matter of conjeo
ture. Army officers heme are confident
that the marauders will not attempt to
molest the American troops unless they
can ambush some small detachments.
The arrest last night of ifpolito Villa,
brother of the notorious bandit chief,
prevented the launching of an armed ex
pedition into Mexico from the United
States, according to Department of Jus.
tiee agents, who have Hipolito in cus
tody.
Villa came here four days ago from Ha
vana to finance a new revolution against
Carranza. thov say, and had already re
cruited several himeet Mexicans. Docu
ments revealing the whole plot have been
discovered by the government agents, it
was said.

WITNESSES DISAPPEAR
IN WHITE SLAVE CASE
District Attorney Believes They Are in
South America.
(By the Intersatiostl News Segitee.).
New York, Sept. 1.-Two persons, whose
importance as witness-s against police
men implicated in the crusade against
white slavery, cannot be overestimated
have been supplied with funds and have
made their escape to South America. The !
witnsses, a man and a woman. were re
ported as retting ready to make their
get away yesterday. Today detectives at
tached to the office of District Attorney
Swann got on the trail of the pair, but
they vanished before they could be ar
rested.
According to the little information that
could be obtained of the escape, the
woman is a white slave. and the man is
a slaver. The district attorney has no
fears th'at his case again, the policemen
is jeopardized by the vanishing of these
two witnesses. Today Judge Swann re
ceived word of his assistant. J. E. Smith.
who is looking up missing witnesses in
vicinity of Boston, that his quest has
been more successful than he dreamed.
Judge Swann received two telegrams
from Mr. Smith. One read:
"Got what I came for."
Inasmuch as Mr. Smith and Detective
McGlynn went to Boston to look up wit
nesses against policemen who have been
spirited away, his brief message was
highly satisfactory to Judge Swann.
Shortly after Mr. Smith again tele
graphed:
"Everything 0. K. Get man who is the
est witness of threats to get out."
The trail of the missing witnesses led
Mr. Smith and his detectives to Revere
Beach today. When word went out that
Smith and his associates were on their
way to Boston, a number of white slavers
made a hasty journey there, They are
doing their utmost to forestall the efforts
of Judge Swann, but thus far they seem
to have met with little success.

HUGHES PRAISES
T. R._IN SPEECH
Lauds Roosevelt for Arous
ing Preparedness
Sentiment.
By WILLIAM HOSTER.
<I ternatieoal New* service.)
Kansas City. Mo.. Sept. 1.-Charles E.
Hughes wound up a busy day in Kansas
at a meeting in Convention Hall tonight
which completeley filled the great audito
rium.
The meeting. estimated at 14,00 in num
ber. was presided over by Walter S.
D)ickey, Repubilcan candidate for United
States Senator from Missouri.
Twenty-five veterans who voted for
Abraham Lincoln occupied seats on the
platform.
Just prior to the meeting Go%. Hughes'
secretary made public this telegram:
"San Francisco, Sept. I.
"I was very glad to receive your tele
gram of co talatinm an I -tA you
for it. ('ned.) HIRAM JOHNSON."
Among others present were several
hundred G . A. R. men, and when the
officiating clergyman in delivering
the invocation prior to the introduc
tion of Hughes prayed for early peace,
the great auditorium echoed with a
chorus of "Amens" from the vterans.
Governor Hughes' Convention Hall
speech was without any new features
aside from his compliments to the war
veterans.
The big crowd went wild when
Hughes paid tribute to Theodore
Roosevelt for arousing the nation to
the necessity I r preparedness and
cheered the Colonel for two minutes.
Kansas is another of those ordinar
ily Republican State'- which may be
counted sarely for Hughe.
As in the others, the accustomed
plurality will be reduced-in the view
of able political observers who have
canvassed the State.
Governor Capper, for instance, predict
ed that Hughes would probably have
,000 or 80.000 plurality. Former Senator
Bristow, one of the followers of the
progressive movement, though he never
left the Republican lwrty. thinks that
it will he 50.0W.
Hughes assailed the "extravagance" of
the Democratic administration in a series
of rear end speeches as he whirled East
ward through Kansas. "The present
dministration has been more extrava
gant than any one in history." he de
clared to a crowd of several hundred
at Ellsworth.
"I understand from high authority that
in present appropriations, outside of
those devoted to preparednese and in
creases in the army and navy, the ad
ministration will exceed by $150,000,000 the
appropriations of any former Congress
in time of peace, and exceed even the
appropriations we had in the civil war."

This was at the first meeting of the

Chairman Lynch interrupted these pre

not close up headquarters?"
He followed this up with some good
advice to the workers.
"Hustle as hard as if you were con
