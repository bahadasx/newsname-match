TIM F.S?
President Notified at Shadow
Lawn of Nomination for
Second Term.
LONG BRANCH, N. J , Sept. 2 -President
Wilson formally accepted his
rennmination here this afternoon with
an address rrcounthiig the legislative
recfti3(nhe demociatic party, a vig
orous defense of hi Mexican policy,
his dealings with the Kurnpean bellig
erents and an outline of his view of
Amerira's obligations for the future. .
With the members of the notifica
tion committee, headed by Senator
Ollie James, grouped about him at
Shadow Lawn, the summer White
House, the president deelarrd the re
publican party is "just the party that
cannot meet the new conditions of a
new age" and that the day of Little
Americanism when "methods of 'pro
tection' and industrial nursing were the
chief stil ly of our provincial statrs
man" was past and gone
Must Play Leading Part.
"We cati no longer indulge our tra
ditiotial provincialism," said the presi
dent "We are to plav a leading part
I in tbr world drama whether wr wish it
or not r shall lend, not borrow ;
art for ourselves, not imitate or fol
low; orpanie Slid initiafe, not prrp
about mrrrly to see where we may get
in."
Speaking of bis diplomatic relations
with the European belligerents the
president followed a declaration that
while property rights might be vindi
cated by claim for damages, the loss
of life and the fundamental rights of
humanity never could br, with this J
statement : (
"The record is clear and consistent i
throughout and stands distinct and :
definite for any one to judge who
wishes to know the truth about it " j
American First of All.
Immediately afterward he jiaid : t
"I am, the candidate of a party, but i
I am above all things else an Amer-1
lean citiirn. I neither seek tlir favor
nor fear the displeasure of that small
alien element amongst us which puts
loyalty to any foreign power hrforr
loyalty to the' United Stales."
Regarding his Mexican policy the
president reiterated that the people of
Mexico are struggling "blindly it may
be and a yet ineffectually, to free
themselves front alien interests, "some
of them American pressing for things
they could never have got in their own
country," and that hr would do every
thing in his power to prevent any one
standing in their way.
A Matter of Principle.
Dealing with Mexico, the president
said :
"W hile Furope was at war our own
continent, one of our own nrighbors,
was shaken hy revolution, fn that
matter, ton, principle was plain and it
wa imperative that we should live up
to it if we were to deserve the trust
of ny real partisan of the right a
free men ee it. We have professed to
believe, and we do believe, that the
people of small and weak states have
the right to expect to be dealt with
exactly a the people of big and pow
erful state would be We have acted
upon that principle in dealing with the
people of Mexico.
"Our recent pursuit of bandit into
Mexican territory wa no violation of
that principle. We ventured to enter
Mexican territory only became there
were no military force in Mexico
that could protect our border from ho
lile attack and our own people from
violence and we have committed there
no single ait of hostilitv or intrrfrr

DAY OF UTILE AMERICANISM
GONE; U. S. WILL STIR WORLD
PRESIDENT WILSON 'summed up bis ambitions for the
United States in hi speech of acceptance at Shadow Laws
this afternoon as follows:
"We hold very difinite ideals. We believe that the energy and
initiative of our people have been too narrowly coached and super
intended; that they ahould be aet free, as we have set them free,
to disperse themselves throughout the nation; that they should not
be cencentrated in the hands of a few powerful guides and guar
dians, as our opponents have again and again, in efftct if not in
purpose, sought to concentrate them. We believe, moreover, who
that looks about him now with comprehending eye can fail to
helieve?-that THK DAY OF LITTLE AMFRICANISM, Willi
IIS NARROW HORIZONS. WHEN METHODS OF "PRO
TECTION" AND INDUSTRIAL NURSING WERE THE
CHIEF STUDY OF OUR PROVINCIAL STATESMEN. ARE
PAST AND GONE AND THAT A DAY OF ENTERPRISE
HAS AT LAST DAWNED FOR THE UNIT I'D -STATES
WHOSE FIELD IS THE WIDE WORLD.
"We hope to see the stimulus of that new day dtaw all Amer
ica, the republics of both continents, on to a new life and energy
and initiative in the great affairs of peace. We are Americana lor
Bug America, and rejoice to look forward to the days in which
America shall strive to stir the world without irritating it or
liawing it on to new antagonisms, when the nations with which
we deal shall at last come to see upon what deep foundations of
humanity and justice our passion fur peace tests, and when all
mankind shall look upon our gieat people with a new sentiment
of admiration, friendly rivalry and real affection, as upon a people
who, though keen to succeed, seeks always to be at once generous
and Just and to whom humanity is dearer than profit or aelttsh
power."

Railroads Abandon Embargo
With Peace Near, .
WASHINGTON. Srpt. 2-"Just at
soon as the house bill, unamended, be
comes a law, the strike order will bd
recalled." A tt. Garretson, spokesman
for the brotherhoods, reiterated today.
Heads of the four brotherhoods, antici
pating the passage of the bill, hava
rode messages to local union officials
readv revoking the strike order.
House Bill Satisfactory!
That was all Mr. Garretson would
say regarding the probable time of call
ing off the strike. This was the first
official slalemrut showing that - lbs
house bill was wholly satisfactory H
the brotherhoods. From other sources
came the persistent reports that an ar
rangement might be perfected whereby
the strike would be railed off official!
before President Wilson actually af
fixes his signature to the hill.
Amendments Mean Delay.
Any amendment to the house bill in
the .senate would throw all the nego
tiations in the indefinite stage and with
that in mind, administration leader
said every effort a the debate in tint
enate progressed was to insure passage
of the house bill in its original form.
Senate to Vote Today.
The bill will be passed without hitch
by the senate today, according to ap
pearances. The senate met today with
an agreement to vote not later than 6
o'clock, ft wa tbr belief of administra
tion leaders that the Adamson lull as it
passed the house will be accepted bv
the senate without change, thus avoid
ing a conference to reconcile differ
ences in the house.
To Be Rushed to Wilson.
As soon as the perfected bill finally
is passed, a special messenger will car
ry it to tbr summer White House at
Shadow rkti, so- the prrsidrnt ma
sign it at once, and end the menace of
a general jiaralysis of the country's
transportation lines at 7 o'clock Mon
day morning.
Roads Revoke Embargoes.
Railroads of the country abandoned
preparations (or war and reverted t
those for peace From all over tbd
country railmad brads annoimcrd that
embargoes idaced on shipments as a
war measure wrrr rrvokrd At Irans.

rcutirs are quoted as saying that there
is everv indication that if the strike
bad come as expertrd, rnough brother
hood ien would have refused to walk
out to make it possible for the road to
maintain service.
Shafroth Urges Changes.
The first amendment proposed today
came from Senator Shafroth, democrat.
He proposed to fix Senator lender
wood's amrndmrnt emp.iwrring the in
terstate commerce commission to make
wage schedules so that, no employ
would be compelled to work for the
rate prescribed.
Must Provide for Future.
Senator Hardwiik. democrat, dvtar-'
ing congress is beihg hcM up by the
railroad employes, spoke for the adop
tion of the Underwood amendment.
"We will not m-asiire up to what is
required of us," be said, "unless we not
only bridge ovrr this crisis but 'also
provide that thrre nevrr ran arise again
in this country an opportunity for any
man or set of m-n, railroad managers
or workers, to seie this government
hy the throat a is now being done. If
we do not do this, I for one will feel
that we have mad- a sorry trade a
well as a sorry spectacle of ourselves."
Proposes Penally.
Senator Thomas aNo proposed an
amendnrent to make it a misdemeanor
for anv person to delay or obstruct the
operation of trains punishable by a fine
of not more than $5)l) or imprisonmrnt
for not more than one year or both.
Perfidious Peace.
Senator Hustiug insisted that con
gress should do something to prevent
the country's being confronted with the
same crisis again as six.n a the pro
