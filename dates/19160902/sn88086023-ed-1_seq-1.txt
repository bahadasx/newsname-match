losses were very heavy.
In Champagne, a Russian contin

the senate will amend the boose

spent a few minutes this after

committee room. An forenoon
Garretson remained hidden. He
looked worn and unstrung.
The thirteen remaining district
llrothorhooi chairmen met this
afternoon. They derided to ean
eel the strike order only when
the eight hour bill becomes a

ruled that the bill becomes a law
after Wilson signs It. Another
