Republican Not the Party to Meet
the New Conditions.
He Says.
UPHOLDS STAND :ON MEXICO
Admits Possibility of Mistakes.
Moi c Interested in Oppressed Peo
ple Than Property Rights?Tells
of European Negotiations.
LONG BRANCH, X. J., Sep
tember 2?President Wilson form
ally accepted his renominate in
here this afternoon, with an ad
dress recounting the legislative
record of the democratic party, a
vigorous defense of his Mexican
policy, his dealings with the Eu
ropean belligerents and an outline
of his views of America's obliga
tions for the future.
With the members of the noti- \
fication committee, headed bvi
Senator James, who delivered the
notification address. grouped;
about him at Shadow Lawn, the;
summer White House, the Presi-j
dent declared the republican party!
was "iust the party that cannot'
meet the new conditions of a new
afre," and that the day of little
\mericanism when "metho-ls
of .'protection' and industrial
nursing wer" the chief study ni
our provincial statesmen"' was j
past and gone.
XT. S. to Take Leading Part.
"We can no longer indulge our tradi
tional provincialism," said the Presi
dent. "We are to play a leading part in
the world drama, whether we wish it
or not. We shall lend, not borrow; act
for ourselves, not imitate or follow;
organize and initiate, not peep about
merely to see where we may get in."
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia
tions with the European belligerents
'he President fojlowed declaration that
while property rights might be vindi
cated by claims for damages, the loss
of life and the fundamental rights of
humanity never could be, with this
statement;
"The record is clear and consistent
throughout ..p i stands distinct and def
inite for any one to iudge who wishes
to know th?* truth, about it."
Immediately afterward he said:
"I am the '-arididate of a p-trty, but
I am above all tilings else an American
citizen. I n* iiher seek the favor nor
f?ar th displeasure oe that small alien
element among u.* which puts loyalty
to any foreign power before loyalty to
* .e L'nited States"
Regarding Mexican Policy.
Regarding his Mexican policy the
President reiterated that the people of
Mexico were struggling "blindly it may
be?and as yet ineffectually" to free
themselves from alien interests "some
of th*-m Americans pressing for things
they could never have not in their own
country," and that he would do every
thing in his power 10 prevent any one
standing 11. their way.
"It is hard doctrine," said he. "only
for those who wish to get something
for themselves out. of Mexico." At an
other point the President said:
"Mistakes I have no doubt mad*' in
this perplexing business, but not in
purpose or object." He declared at an
ot'ned point;
"I am more interested in the fortunes
of oppressed men and pitiful women
and children than in any property
rights whatever."
Legislative Achievements.
At the outset of his references to
the legislative achievements of his
party the President enumerated the
laws place'! on the statute books re
lating to business, including tariff re
vision, anti-trust laws, revision of the
banking and currency system, rural
credits, rehabilitation of the merchant
marine and creation of the federal
trade commission.
"What other party has understood
the task ho well or executed it so in
telligentry and energetically?" he
asked. "What other party has at
tempted it at all? The republican
leaders apparently know of no means
??i no means
of assisting business but protect
How to stimulate it and put it u
a new footing of energy and enter
prise they have not suggested."
At the conclusion of his review of the
party record the President declared;
"This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of sanguine
promises; but it is not. It is a record of
promises made four years ago and now
actually redeemed in constructive legis
lation." Then, later, he said; "We have
in four years <*oine very near to carry
ing out the platform of the progressive
party as well as our own; for we are
also progressives."
The President's address was some
6,000 words long, one of the most
lengthy he has delivered on any occa
sion since taking office. The President's
speech follows;

FRANK H. HITCHCOCK TAKES ?
PART IN BIG CONFERENCE
! !
Believes That Party Principles
Rather Than Candidates Will Be
Issue on Which to Make Fight.
BY N. 0. MESSENGEH.
CHICAGO, September 2.?
I Republican managers have been!
j holding day and evening confer-i
; ences in Chicago to take up thej
| slack in the campaign towline i
I which has been sagging to a no-j
I ticeable degree.
! National Chairman Willoox, Western 1
I Manager Hert and a group of national !
i committeemen and advisory aids were
i in the conferences. There was also
there Frank H. Hitchcock, for whose
j presence and assistance as a member of
the advisory committee the west has
I been insistently clamoring.
Reports coming from the western
country, after Candidate Huphf?' tour,
show a condition generally satisfactory
to the republicans, but also indicate the
urgent necessity of speedy organization,
of which there is unquestioned lack at
prvsent, of the formation of definite
policies of campaign and "getting down
to brass tacks," as the politician says.
Organization Is Lacking.
No single bureau of the republican
national organization is as yet fully or
ganized and at work. The republicans
have not "got going" yet, while the ma
chinery of the opposition is running I
full speed and overtime.
Viewing the situation broadly, the re- j
publicans find that, in the* western
states, the campaign is not to be so |
much a personal as a party fight. It is I
not to be so much a contest between j
Wilson and Hughes as a comparison be- j
tween republican and democratic poli- j
cies and platforms.
Careful observers in the western j
country find that in the vast body of;
the independent vote, especially among j
the progressives, with their ideals. :
there is not such a wide margin of i
choice as between President Wilson and j
Mr. Hughes, or, at any rate, the voters!
are not so considering. It is a fact that,
to a great many progressives and inde
pendent voters. President Wilson is as
attractive as Mr. Hughes, in measuring
up to their ideals of progressivism.
Candidates Equally Acceptable.
That applies to the personality of the
two candidates, and is accentuated by
the fact that Mr. Wilson, they say, has j
a progressive record of recent making. 1
; Mr. Hughes' record in the same line is
I somewhat dimmed to memory by the :
; interlude of his service on the Supreme!
: bench. It is claimed, furthermore, that '
' in his recent tour Mr. Hughes offered ;
no program superior in merit, in detail j
? or general, to the record of President j
Wilson.
To the voters who hold to this view, I
therefore, an appeal for support must;
: be made on party lines, it is claimed, j
j They must be asked to choose between I
' republican policies as against democra
tic policies, with respect to their effect}
j upon the nation and upon th'-lr own j
localities. It .is contended that this!
i will be the only way to get and hold j
'the progressives who are desirous of i
coming back to the party. It must be j
made, it is said, plain that the repub
lican party with its platform and pro-;
pMsed policies should take over the ad- i
ministration of the government rather;
than that the democrats should he per- \
rnitted to remain in power.
The sum of reports from the western ;
states indicates a present preponder- j
ance of republican sentiment. that is ;
to say, of attachment to republican j
principles as now enunciated and as j
! accepted by regulars and progressive ;
leaders. Many republican leaders think
it is vitally necessary at once to crystal
lize that sentiment by a givorous cam
paign in behalf of the republican party
as well as in the interest of the presi
dential candidate.
Party Rather Than Men.
As heretofore stated, the conviction
| prevails' among state leaders that the
1 republican party is to pull the na
i tional ticket through rather than that
the national ticket is to be < epended
| upon alone to pull the republican party I
? through. That will mean, it is de-j
' dared, that state and county, sen - .
| atorial and congressional tickets must i
| be utilized to get out the republican j
' strength and to stimulate interest in j
! republican policies.
| Some members of the national or- \
j ganization, it is said, are fully aware j
!<_>f this state of affairs, and will see to |
it that r. campaign is instituted along ;
thoroughgoing party lines, republican- ;
i ism against democratic policies. The j
| republican platform is understood to be
acceptable to the great mass of the j
! progressives. In preaching republi
canism, therefore, it is claimed that
! there will be no advocacy of reaction. ;
Western leaders have not had their '
enthusiasm aroused yet by the national
j organization in the east. The national
j chairman is not widely known, nor is
| he credited with detailed knowledge ot
| western conditions.
i Western Manager Hert and his assist
ants, however, are backing up the west- 1
i err leaders and starting a good lirn- of
?teamwork. The presence of Frank H
j Hitchcock as a member of the advis
ory committee will have immediate ef- ?
i feet. it is said, in encouraging and stif
! feiimg up the western local leaders
! who have worked with him before and ;
| have full confidence in his judgment.
The western headquarters has the aid
i of such men as Fred Cpham, the west- i
' ern treasurer; Adams of Iowa, Maddox
of Montana. Howell of Nebraska.<;ameld
of Ohio. Ickes of Illinois and Hemenway
of Indiana. The head of th?- publicity!
bureau is a livewire Kansas newspa- ?
per man, W. Y. Morgan, who is a de
cided asset, arid an original Hughes
1 man. He is assisted by George F. ;
! Authier of Minneapolis.
, He will have several Washington cor- j
j respondents on his staff. Edward B.
(..'lark, one of the most widely known j
Chicago and Washington newspaper- ',
i men, has charge of the metropolitan ;
i district.
Two Nomination* Confirmed.
! The Senate yesterday confirmed the i
nomination of John C. Koons to be |
first assistant postmaster .general. It j
also confirmed the nomination of ,\ l 1
exander T. Vogelsang to be flrvt ?????im
ant secretary of the interior.
D. C. PUBLIC PARKS
BEING IMPROVED
Whenever Funds Are Available
Force Is Engaged in Va
rious Parts of City.
ARTISTIC TREATMENT
FOR TRIANGULAR PLOTS
Flowering- Plants, Which Are Ex
pected to Bloom Next Spring. Be
ing Planted in Garfield Park.
In accordance with the policy of im
proving- public reservations in the Dis
trict whenever sufficient funds are
available. Col. William H. Harts, en
gineer officer in charge of public build
ings and grounds, has a force engaged
in that work in various parts of the
city.
Two small triangular reservations on
the north and south sides of Pennsyl
vania avenue between 20th and 21st
streets are receiving new treatment on
harmonious lines. Each will be pro
vided with a thirty-foot pool, with a
fountain jet in the center approached
by walks, which will be flanked with
rustic seats and backed up with orna
mental trees and shrubbery. One of
these pools will be near 20th street,
and the other n^ar 21st street. Both
parks will be provided w\h service
walks for the benefit of pedestrians
desiring to make short cuts.
Similar Improvements in Petworth.
Two similar reservations in the Pet
worth section also are being improved.
One of these is at the intersection of
Georgia avenue, 9th street and Upshur
street and the other is bounded by New
Hampshire avenue and Taylor and 7th
streets. Both will be provided with
ornamental trees and shrubberies, con
venient walks and rustic benches and
inclosed in concrete copings. The Up
shur street reservation will contain a
flower bed near the north end with
shrubbery beds at the north and south
ends. In the other reservation a turf
lawn will face the New Hampshire ave
nue side and a flower bed will be placed
in the angle at. the corner of Tth and
Taylor streets, with stone stairways on
both streets.
Similar treatment is being given to
the small reservation at the intersec
tion of North Carolina avenue and A
street northeast. The present bare
space will be adorned with a flower bed
having ornamental trees and shrub
beries as a background and made ac
cessible by walks flanked with com
fortable benches.
Improving- Garfield Park.
Garfield Park, in Southeast Washing
ton. one of the larger and more preten
tious parks, also is undergoing im
provement. A striking feature of the
4iew work is tho planting of a peren
nial border about 2.r?0 feet in length
along the F street side of the park.
The border will be composed of well
known flowering plants, such as phlox,
peonies, hollyhocks, artemisia, anemone
and coreopsis. The planting will be
done this fall, with a view to having
the flowers in full I.loom next spring.
Another project now under way is
the development of a large nursery in
the southern section of West Potomac
Park between the embankments of the
Pennsylvania railroad and of the High
way bridge. It is being planted on
systematic lines, with about 1,900 ever
greens, including twenty-eight varieties
of evergreen shrubs ami twenty varie
ties of evergreen trees. It is designed
to forn: a bright green spot in :i con
spicuous section of the pari: a ? all sea
sons of the year.
PERSHING INSPECIS TROOPS.
Commander o? Punitive Expedition
Now at Columbus. N. M.
COLUMBUS, N. M., September 2.?Gen.
J. J. Pershing, commander of the
American punitive expedition, is here
today from field headquarters in Mex
ico to review the regulars stationed at
this point, and to inspect the new camp
site of the Massachusetts National
Guard. While en route he inspected
troops at < >.io Federico and Vado Fusi
las. The general expects to remain at
Columbus about lour days
The new army road from field head
quarters was in ? xcellent shape, and
the general made the trip here in less
than fifteen hours' actual running
time.
One Killed, Four Hurt, in Auto.
NORFOLK. Va , September 2.?One
woman was killed and four others were
seriously injured when an automobile
in which the party was returning from
Ocean View whirled over twice this
morning at 2 o'clock. Mrs. Vernon Daw
son of Norfolk, who was driving the
car. died from injuries as she was
being taken to a local hospital.
Veritable Feast for the Eye
in the Planogravure Section
Scenes at the Y. M. C. A. camp.
South River, near Annapolis, Md.,
constitute one of the most interest
ing full page spreads in tomorrow's
Pla rogra vnr'- Supplement of The
Sunday Star. Nine of these pictures
are proof of why boys like camp
life, and why this year's Y. M. C. A.
camp was one of the most success
ful ever held.
Tommy and Tabby must have be
come jealous at hearing of all the
good times Washingtonians were
having at summer camps, so they
decided to get their names and pic
tures in the Planogravure Supple
ment by taking a fishing trip. They
didn't make any catches, but they
had a good time, even if it does
look as though they took their fun
rather seriously.
Ten pictures by The Star's staff
photographer on the border are of
additional scenes in and around
the camp of the District guardsmen
down there. A full-page spread
of six pictures shows general scenes
around and about the camps of the
United States militiamen in gen
eral. A new Mexican revolver can
non which can shoot thirty four
inch shells a minute is an interest
ing feature on this page.
Altogether, tomorrow's Plano
gravure Supplement is an extreme
ly interesting one, both from a
news and human interest point of
view.

MANY EPIDEMIC VICTIMS
ARE OF TENDER YEARS
Over Three-Fourths of the Children
Who Die of Paralysis Are
Under Five.
NEW* YORK, September 2.?More than
three-fourths of the children who have
died of infantile paralysis in New York
city in the epidemic which has prevailed
for the last three months were less than
five years old, according to figures is
sued by the department of health. The
total number of deaths from this disease
for the three months is given as 1,922.
Of these 1,499 were of children less than
five years old.
The figures show that apparently the
most susceptible age is between one and
two years, as the greatest number of
deaths were of children of that age, while
the number of deaths decreased rapidly
with each additional year.
The figures afford some interesting tom
1 parisons. At all ages the male victims
outnumbered the female at an average
! ratio of about four to three, the total
; deaths of men and boys being 1,119 and of
women and girls 803. Despite the belief
at the beginning of the epidemic that
: negroes were exempt 29 of them were
victims.

RAILROADS RECALL
B EMBARGOES

Take It for Granted Congress
Will "Force Them to
Surrender."
CLAIM LARGE PERCENTAGE
- OF EMPLOYES ARE LOYAL
Executives at Chicago Confident of
Ability to Keep Many Trains
in Operation.
CHICAGO, September 2.?
Feeling assured that the strike
order will he canceled, the fol
lowing; railroads today revoked
their embargoes:
Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul, Chicago and Alton, Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific, Chicago
and North Western, Monon. Chi
cago and Eastern Illinois, Chicago
?Great Western and the Illino's
Central. The Chicago, Burling
ton and Quincy revoked its or
der last night. Western rail
road heads said that they under
stood eastern roads would take
similar action in the course of
the day.
Reports from other centers in
dicate that railroads generally are
canceling their embargoes.
Men Promise to Work.
Railroad executives, although ex
pressing- the belief that the passage of
the eight-hour-day bill by the House
of Representatives and the prospect of
its passage by the Senate tonight had
practically removed all danger of a
strike at present, announced many de
sertions from the ranks of the brother
hoods in the middle west and asserted
they had sufficient men to operate
trains on most of the roads in the
event of a strike.
For several of the big middle western
roads, general managers claimed as
high as 2T> per cent of the engineers
and conductors had given assurance
that they will remain at work, even
though the strike is put into effect.
Railroad passenger traflic through
Chicago for the last two days has been
heavier thnn for many months, the
large increase being attributed to
anxiety of tourists to reach their homes
before next Monday, the time set for
the strike.
Forced Into Surrender.
TTale TTolden, president of the Chi
cago, Burlington and Quincy. spokes
man for the railroads in the confer
ences w itli President Wilson, said the
railroads are convinced Congress will
force throutrh the eight-hour-day law
before the date set for the strike, but
that they are taking no chances.
"It seems that Congress will make us
surrender." Mr. Ifolden said, explaining
an order by his freight department re
voking the embargo. "The Burlington
and other roads feel that there is little
chance for a strike now. We are re
voking our embargo so as not to in
convenience the shippers at all. But
we are going ahead with our plans to
operate trains in event of a strike. The
strike order must be actuallv revoked
before we let up in our precautions.
We 11:1 v e men enough to run our
t rains."
Discredited by Brotherhoods.
While the railroad executives were'
claiming the defection of thousands of;
brotherhood members, officials of the
unions, through Timothy Shea, vice j
president of the Brotherhood of Fire- j
men and Enginemen, said the railways]
habitually circulate such stories, and"
they have no fears their men would not
obey the strike call.
Polls of employes who are members
of the unions are practically completed
and in general the roads said that they
would be able to count on the loyalty
of about 25 per cent of their trainmen,
even if the strike order is not revoked.
The most startling of the announce
ments came from the general offices of
the Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe in a
statement that the four brotherhoods?
engineers, firemen. conductors and
trainmen?would hold meetings to re
quest the heads of their unions at
Washington to revoke the strike order.
In addition, suits for injunctions
against calling strikes were filed by
individual brotherhood members in va
rious parts of the country, including a
number of Santa Fe trainmen employed
in Texas.
Claim Engineers Will Stick.
The Minneapolis and St. Louis rail
road at Minneapolis stated that en
gineers of that road would remain at
work to a man, averring that the vote

BROTHERHOOD CHIEFS MAY
NOT WAIT ON SIGNATURE
Assured President Will Approve
Measure to Be Passed Finally
by Senate Today.
MAY BE SENT BY MESSENGER
Question Raised to Legality if Af.
fixing of Presidential Signature
Is Delayed Until
Sunday.
"Just as soon as the House bill,
unamended, becomes a law," A. B.
Garretson, spokesman for the
brotherhoods, said today, "the
strike order will be recalled."
The railroad strike is to be
called (jff tonight, official Wash
ington feels assured, as a prompt
result of the driving efforts of
Congress to put the eight-hour
dav bill through within the time
limit, and secure the President's
signature before midnight.
The bill, which last night passed
the House. 2y> to 56. carrying the
approval of President Wilson and
the brotherhood chiefs, is to be
passed by the Senate before 6
o'clock this afternoon, and prob
ably with only one minor amend
men:.
Know President Will Sign.
Just what will happen then is not
positive, but the general feeling is that
the strike will be called off immediats
j ly. The brotherhood leaders know that
i the President is ready to sign it and
that only his absence at Shadow Lawn
will cause any delay in its becoming a
law. There is confidence that they will
immediately send out the rescinding
order in code which they have already
1 prepared. This belief is strengthened
by the conviction that they are anxious
j to l*rt their own members know as soon
jas possible whether they are to work
Monday.
Administration leaders will neglect
no effort to hasten the signature of
the bill by the President. It will be
rushed to the White House, and if it
arrives there before 6:30 p.m. a spe
cial messenger will be started for
Shadow Uwn. It is a strong proba
bility that the President may come afl
far as Philadelphia to sign it before
midnight.
There is some disagreement as t?
whether it would be legal if signed by
i the President Sunday. Several leaders
in Congress today said th^y believed
I no serious objection could be main*
tained, but that every possible en
deavor will be made to have it signed
before midnight.
Ready to Call Off Strike.
I Heads of the four brotherhoods, an
ticipating such action by Congress, had
code messages to local union officials
ready revoking the order sent broad
I cast early this week for a strike start
! ing at 7 a.m. Monday.
I If the bill is passed, it is believed,
! they will not wait until it is actually
' signed by President "Wilson.
| While this legislation is admitted on
| all sides to be but an emergency meas
| ure to stop the strike, and that it
merely effects a truce?probably until
after election?there was general feel
ing of relief today.
Congress Prepares to Adjourn.
With the passage of the stop-strike
legislation Congress is preparing to
break up by the middle of the week, eo
that the members can get back to their
home districts and election campaign
activities.
The Senate will begin to vote on the
eight-hour bill at 4 o'clock, and take
the final vole on the bill not later than
6 o'clock this evenirm.
Prediction was made by the demo
cratic- leaders today that the bill as
finally agreed to l?y the Senate will
be practically the House measure.
Alleged Defect Covered.
At least one amendment will be add
ed, but this will not change the pro
visions of the bill at all, and the House
leaders say they will concur in it im
mediately.
The bill as passed by the House
makes provision for the expenditure of
$25,000 to investigate into the effect of
the eight-hour law, but fails to specify
that this money may be expended in
the District of Columbia. I'nder the
law specifications as to the expendi
ture of the money must be made. There
fore the Senate will insert it.
Leaders hold that the House bill will
prevent the impending strike and they
do not care to take any chances of
altering the bill ami thereby endanger
ing the strike situation.
Senator Underwoou's amendment pro
viding that tiie interstate commerce
commission shall have tjie power to fix
hours of labor and wages for the rail
road employes will he beaten, it was
predicted.
After the bill has passed the Senate, if
it has been amended in any way. it
must go back to the House for further
action.
If the amendments of the Senate are
important the bill may be sent to con
ference.
If they do not materially change the
bill the House prof>ably will agree to
the amendments of the Senate.
If the bill passes the Senate without
amendment, then it will be signed as
speedily as possible by the Vice Presi
dent and the Speaker and hurried to
the President for his signature.
House Waiting on Senate.

a'clock the democratic leaders had ar
