mately twenty-five per cent of the
brotherhood members employed on
that road had promised to remain at
work. Vice President W. L. Parke of
the Illinois Central said that he was
reluctant to make an estimate as to
his road. All but two if the forty
three crews of Chicago suburban
passenger trains had promised to stick
to their posts, he admitted, but said
he did not know what the proportion
would be on regular passenger and
freight train runs.
President Bierd of the Chicago &
Alton, said that a very careful canvas
of his road had been made and that
the response was "very encouraging."
W. J. Jackson, receiver for the

"Twenty-five per cent of our train
men had absolutely promised to stick.
They don't care who knows it. An
other twenty-five per cent say that
they will remain, but they don't want
to get into trouble with the brother
hoods until it is certain that a strike
will be called."
T. A. Gregg, vice president of the
Order of Railway Conductors, said
that he had not been informed of any
disloyalty among the men. Mr. Gregg
was in secret conference all afternoon
•with Timothy Shea, vice president of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire
men and Enginemen.
Railway heads held two meetings.
The executive committee of the Gen
eral Managers' association met alone,
and later held a joint meeting with
the presidents and other high offi
cials. The formal statement issued
by the managers last night states
that "there is a widespread and grow
ing disaffection among the train em
ployes who have been ordered by
their leaders to strike next Monday.
The statement made reference to
legislation at Washington as follows:
"The managers could not decide
what their attiutde would be until
they knew what the provisions of the
law would be, and they could not
know this until the law was actually
passed by both houses."
The statement asserts that "the en
gineers of one of the largest lines en
tering Chicago met today and voted
to withdraw from the movement. The
identity of this line is for the present
kept confidential. The engineers have
conferred with the members of the
other brotherhooda on this road and
have found that the conductors are
disposed to take similar action.".

A score of railroads revoked em

measures.
Meanwhile, the senate debated
the Adamson eight-hour bill passed
by the house with prospect of a
