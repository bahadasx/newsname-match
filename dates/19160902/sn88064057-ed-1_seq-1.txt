COMMISSION DENIEi
COOLEY'S REQUESr
CARTER AND BRADFORD WI
WHEN 'HEY PROTEST ANY
REDusIlON ON RIVER.
CLAIMS DECREASE UNFAIR
It is Said Steamboat Question Has
Constantly Vexed Commission Es
pecially Because of Indiscrimi
nate Cutting Prac*" . ',
Baton Rouge -
The Louis!ana Railroad Commission
at Baton Rouge denied Captain L. V.
Cooley, of the steamer America, au
thority to make a flat rate of twenty
cents per sack as against the original
graduating rate based on mileage, on
rice carried to New Orleans from all
points between Donaldsonville and St.
Joseph. Captain Cooley came to Ba
ton Rouge to argue for the establish
ment of such a rate, and Captain H.
M. Carter. representing the Carter
Packet Company, and Captain M. F.
Bradford. of the Bradford Transporta
tion Company, came up from New Or
leans to protest against such action.
The commission decided the reduction
asked for was unreasonable.
Last year. Captain Cooley represent
ed to the commission that the twep
ty-cent rate was sufficient and induc
ed that body to grant the reduction.
As a result of such rate cutting. Cap
tains Carter and Bradford told the
commissioners, they lost money that
season. Capt. Cooley claims to have
made money on th,- lower rate.
The steamboat rate question is one
which has constan:ly vexed the com
mission especially because of indis
criminate cutting practiced by some.
and when Commissioners Shelby Tay
lor and John T. Michel held the meet
1Uto congi4er the .res. i.W al -
seemed desirous of settling the ques
tion once for all.
Captain Cooley contended that he
could, with profit, transport rice froe
lt Joseph to New Orleans, and fromi
i all intermediatepolnts as far as kIbs
aldsonville at a rate of twenty aeti
per sack, and he asked the commis
t aen to grant him authority to estfh
lish such a rate, to be general, on th1
ground that even -before last yeAr'I
cut the other companies operatinb-e
of New Orleans had virtually renasd
I ed the higher rate by granting...i
bates. Captains Carter and Bradn2l
admitted that rebating once existed
but said that the practice long hat
dropped into disuse. Both told the
eoammiesoners they would weleoma
e any regulations looklng toward a pre
d vetion o rebating.

RAILWAY EMPLUOYES
SET DATE FOR STRIKE
NGRESS IS NOW PRESIDENT
WILSON'S LAST RESORT TO
AVERT DISASTER.
FACTS LAID BEFORE CONGRESS
President Informs Congress of All
Negotiations and Asks Legislation
" He Now Regards Necessary.
Labor Day Set as Strike Day.
Washington.- -President '. .!ion has
del!nitely decided to go before 'on
gr, is in person to recommexd legisla
tio;n aimed to avert the threatened na
It u-wide railroad strike or to stop it
it it comes before congress can act.
!He worked until late Monday night
on his message, in nhich he will tell
members of the senate and house the
;n, otiatigns to date and la: b:fore
them a definite legislative program.
The president reached this decision
aft. r conferences at the White House
with the committee of eight railroad
pre:~.idents and the four brotherhood
heads on a new proposal for settle
vit of differences suggested by the
ex cutives, and after a prolonged dis
cussion Cf the situation at the c; ,tol
wi't the members of the denw ratic
t' ,oring committee of the senate.
The proposition of the railroad exe
cutives was that an investigation of
ra!! Issues be conducted by a commis
ision to be named by the president, the
in\vestigation to last for a period of
,three or four months, no action to be
taken by either side in the meantime,
matd at the conclusion of the inquiry
Lh.b situation to be what it now is, the
en:ployes having the choice of either
arbitrating or striking.
When the railroad brotherhood
1te;ds went to the White House Mon
Ilay the, president not only laid before
hem the plan of the executives, but
,ngly urged the withdrawal of a
.utative strike order sent out, sub
,cet to telease, calling for a walkout
i. 400,000.brotherbood members at
, t jte ead saying only the com
of 640 which left Washington
aundi had power to recall the order.
Coip s of the strike order were
pro t to the president's attention
fte they,. aet into the possession
i :ajlr*oad executives. It had
I'owii tlat members of the cotp
it e of 640 carried home with them
ttative order, but no one outside
e brotherhood councils had suspect
to date had been set.
I1" spite of the apparent final ail
of his efforts to bring the two
-dea.together, the president is repre
ad as being still hopeful of avert
A strike.
'a legislative program prepared
- congress includes the following
roe:
2t eight.Lour-day law for railroad
so framed as to give the
time to prepare for It; and:

Kern. the dempocratic leader, Sunday
when it seemed virtually certain that
a break between the railroads and
their employes must follow final con

Possibilities of legislation were talk

Belief that negotiations between the
railroad executives and representa

an agreement has been growing.
