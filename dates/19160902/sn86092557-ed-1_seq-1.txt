SCHOOL CHILDREN *
WILL BEINSPECTEO
Decision Made Today By
Boards of Health and
Education
All children must bring health certificates
to school at the opening September

uu/ <ab o uibbviuQ wt vow viv; wwiuu wV
Education and the City Board of
Health. This order is practically the
same as contemplated and embodied
ln~the resolution recently passed by
the Marlon county medical society In
regard to U-o opening of Fairmont's
schools. The only manner In which
the now regulations, which were issued
today by the city health department
and signed by Dr. C. M. Ramage and
Geo. M. Alexander differ is that all ot
next week will be devoted to the work
of (nspectlon and the children will be
required to see their family physician
instead ot being Inspected at the
schools.
It was decided at the meeting held
today that the plan of hiring additional
Inspectors as originally planned,
was not leasable as It would require
all ot the doctors In town two or three
days to Inspect the enrollment that Is
anticipated this year.
A case of Infantile paralysis has developed
at Morgantown and the child
at that place Is being carefully guarded
so that no possible spread ot the
disease may occur. In case the epidemic
at Morgantown spre dS it may
be decided advisable to postpone the
opening of the schools here. In any
case all children will be required to
bring health certificates when the
schools are opened.

passing a standing street
car are violating the city laws, and
the boy riding the wheel dashed by

the appropriations of any former congress
In time of peace, and exceed even
the appropriations we had In the

City Hall Notes
Working the old-gag that "I'm no
bum. you can see I'm no regular boomer,
but I have to get home and I've
lost my pocketbook." a young husky
looking Individual entered the city hall
yesterday and asked for funds to get
to Pittsburgh as he had lost his pocketbook
and didn't know where to locate
bis father who was at present on
a vacation In the East. If he knew
where the old man was he'd telegraph
for money. City Clerk Kern put a
list of employers before the young
man and told him to work a few days
for one of them and get home that
way. The young gent decided that
rather than soil his hands with the Industrial
grease of Fairmont he would
try walking. He was number 118 to
pull the same gag within the past year.
The city Is working on a system of
providing parsing spaces ior auto owners
so that the business men's car will
have a place to loat during the day.
The Talbott property on Jefferson and
Jackson street is under consideration.
The milk ordinance which feas never
been enforced during the seven years
It has been on the books will have a
fling in the Board meeting Monday
morning when Dr. C. H. Rentage will
receive orders to go ahead with the

authority to close dairies as he sees
St.
Jimmy McWilllams, the 84 year old
pensioned employee of the city who
Is to have the roof taken from over his

only live until 1918 which year he is
going to die according to an angel that
spoke to him while half asleep, half
cwake one night when he was sitting
smoking his pipe before the Are. He
says he is willing to die any time and
that as soon as he gets to heaven he
will remember the good deeds the city
has done tor him.

JAPANESE GOLD TO
HELP M BRITISH
Tokio To Take Exchequoi
Bonds For Their De
posits Here
TOKIO, Sept. 3 (Correspondence o(
The Associated Press.)?The Japanese
government has officially announced
that with its gold specie reserve on
deposit In American banks It will purchase
British exchequer bonds to the
amount of 109,000,000 yen or about
150,000,000. The term Is one year
and the rate of Interest six per cent
It is understood here that the British
'government yill use the gold in
payment for munitions of war purchased
in the United States.
It is understood that the Japanese
specie will be transferred to the British
government by degrees as necessity
arises, t The advantages of this
investment are a aid to be manifold. In
the first place, by converting government
specio which cannot derive greater
profit than 1 1-2 per cent, interest
in the United States, into the 6 per
cent. British exchequer notes Japan
will be able to realize a net gain of
- 4 1-2 per cent. Interest per annum.
Secondly, in case the Japanese government
is confronted with need of specie
in America the British government will
, purchase the exchequer notes from
the Japanese and furnish the required
amount. Thirdly, the Japanese gov
ernment will lose nothing from the dis:
parity of the proportionate rate between
the British currency (pounds)
and the American currency (dollars)
; in paying the price of the British exchequer
notes in American specie,
which difference is to be borne by the
British government according to the
agreement.
