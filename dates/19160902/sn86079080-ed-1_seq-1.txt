SAYS.
We were informed by pretty
reliable authority that certain
persons. poiitic;al enemies of for
rmer sheriff Berthelot, gave vent
to the wild statements that Mr.
, Berthelot'. hbooks while sheriff
show hinm to be short some two
thousand dollars and that charges
(presumably of embezzlement)
were· to be preferred against him
last. Monday. A week has elapsed i
ana the latter vicious rumoLefail
eld to materialize.
Mr. Berthelot, when interview
ed and asked for a statement
concerning the alleged rumors,
said in part:
"I h:ve served the people of
this parish as Sheriff for sixteen
years and am proud to say that
during all that time no one has
ever questioned myi honesty in
collecting and accounting for the
revenues of the state and uarish.
"1 have never received or ap
propriated a single cent outside
of what the law allowed me as a
commission and I defy any man
to prove the contrary. Thank
God, no one can truthfully brand'
me as a DEFAULTER."
'These alleged rumors are fabrica
tions of malignant individuals
who would wish to see me dead
politically and socially. Their
malignity is increased by the
fact that, although defeated for
sheriff, I still hold considerable
power in politics. That these rum
ors are false and malicious is evid
.nt from the fact that no charges
were precerred as rumored.
"I do not den: that the sheirff's
office during my incumbency
has made clerical mistakes. It is
human to err. But any mistakes
made, either by me or my deputi
es, were mistakes of the head
and not of the heart.
"I have never failed to receive
my quietus from the State. The
parish Auditor inspected my
books and gave me a report there
on a sh rt time after I left the of
fice and his findings were that my
books were correct. with the ex
caption of a'" few clerical mistak
es too insignificant to mention I
here. I am willing and anxious
ti let any impartial and expert I
auditor go over my books again 1
and test their correctness.
these rumors, however false, can 1
not go by unanswered and I pro- I
strict acsountabilit7."
For the benefit of all concerned }
we respectfully suggest that an f
impai.taLand competent auditor
be employed as soon as ble i
to examin MD. Ber the a books
andlet the publiebave the report.
If there ts aWt t at ll Oin tle t
