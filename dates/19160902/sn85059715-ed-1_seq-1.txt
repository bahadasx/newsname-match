SENATE NOT TO CHANGE
BILL FROM THE HOUSE
mv ASSOCIATED
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2? Tho on
ictment into law of enough of Presi-1
dent Wilson's program to prevent a
railroad strike seemed assured when ,
the Senate re-assembled this morn-1
ing with a program which called for a'
vote not later than 6 o'clock this!
evening.
It was the belief of administration ;
leaders thrit the A dam son bill as it
passed the House late yesterday, ap
proved by President Wilson and for
mally accepted by the labor leaders
an meeting their demands, would
eventually be accepted by the Senate,,
thus obviating a delay in conferenco i
to reconcile differences with the
House.
As soon as the perfected bill final-;
ly is passed a special messenger will |
carry it to the summer White House:
at Shadow Lawn so the president may !
sign it at once and end the menace!
of a general paralysis of the coun- i
try's transportation lines at 7 o'clock:
Monday morning.
The first amendment* proposed today
came from Senator Shaffroth, Demo
crat. He proposed to fix Senator Un
derwood's amendment, empowering
the Interstate Commerce Commission
to make wage schedules so that no em
ployee would be compelled to work
for the rate prescribed.
Senator Hard wick. Democrat, de
claring Congress was being held up
by the railroad employes, spoke for
the adoption of the Underwood amend
ment.
"We wil Inot measure up to what is
required of us," he said "unless we
not only bridge over this crisis but
also provide that there never can
arise again In this country an oppor
tunity for any man or set of men, rail
road managers or workers, to seize
this government by the throat as is
now being done. If we do not do this
T, for one, will feel that we have made
a sorry trade as well as a sorry spec
tacle of ourselves."
Senator Thomas also proposed an
intendment to make it a misdemeanor
for any person to delay or obstruct the
operation of trains punishable by a
fine of not more than 5500 or imprison
ment for not more than one year, or
both.
PROHIBITION
Party Files a List of Its State
Nominees with the Secre
tary of State.
CHARLESTON. Sept. 2.?The Prohi
bition party, through its state chair
man. Squire Halstead, of Kessler's
Cross Lanes, ban filed with Secretary j
of State Stuart F. Reed its nominees j
made in a state convention on June 7, j
with a request that such nominees be j
certified to the several circuit clerks ,
to be placed on the ballot, in November. I
Under the primary election law a po
litical party has been considered one
that has polled at least five per cent,
of the total vote. The Prohibitionists
in the 1014 election received only 3.931
votes for congressman-at-large out of
235,351 cast. Chairman Halstead in
a lengthy brief filed with the list of
the nominees contends that if the pri
mary law deprives them of place on
the ticket it would be a retroactive
law. as the Prohibition party was in
existence before the present primary
law was enacted.
Secretary of State Reed has put the
question up to Attorney General A. A.
Lilly as to whether the Prohibition
party is a political party under the
West Virginia primary law and wheth
er as secretary of state he should cer
tify the list of nominees, just filed, to
the several counties to be printed on
the ballot in November
_
: When the House convened Demo
1 cratic leaders had arranged a pro
gram to Insure final disposition of
the eight-hour railroad bill by to
night if the Senate acts.
"We are first taking u psorae pri
vate bills and will then recess until
we get the eight-hour bill back from
the Senate," said Democratic Leader
| Kitchln.
"We are keeping in touch with the
Senate and will be ready to finally
'dispose of the bills as soon as the
! Senate votes."
The brotherhood leaders still de
, cline to say whether they will send
the code words means "satisfactory
settlement" to their general chair
men immediately upon passage of
the bill or hold off until it Is signed
by the president. It Is generally be
lieved. however, that the message
calling off the strike will go out as
soon as both houses have acted. They
have no fear that the president will
not sign the bill if it takes the form
now indicated.
Senator Sherman, Republican, as
sailed the efforts of the brotherhoods
or labor leaders to prevent a compul
sory arbitration law.
"It is the Senate that is to be put
under involuntary servitude," said
he. "I have been sought to put under
Involuntary servitude. If legislation
has fallen to so low a degreo, If we
i are ready though servilely to aban
don our duty then American politics
have reached the point where the few
I and not the many govern."
Senator Sherman charged Presi
dent Wilson with making a "petty
political" bargain on the eve of elec
tion and read a telegram from an ac
tors' union in Chicago, opposing com
pulsory arbitration.

More Fine Reports Brought to

quarters by Visitors.
Formor Senator Theodore E. Bur
ton, of Ohio, who was a candidate for
the Republican presidential nomination
and who received a subBtatnlal vote

the big guns In tbe Republican cam
paign In West Virginia. This an
nouncement was made at Republican
state headpuarterB Saturday by Secre
tary Charles G. Coffman.
Although Mr. Burton's Itinerary has
not yet been arranged It is practically
certain that he will make a speech in
Clarksburg. The Ohio statesman made
a fine impression in ClarkBburg when
he spoke here on Memorial day, and
local people will Insist that he be senj
here for a speech. And there's an
other reason. The former senator likes
Clarksburg and it is certain that he
would be pleased to make a speech
.here. His tour of the state will prob
ably begin early in October, although
no official announcement to this effcct
has been made.
Visitors to Btate headquarters con
tinue to bring glowing reports of party
harmony In all parts of the state.
Among those who visited headquarters
Friday were Wallace Gribble. of West
Union, candidate for the state senate
from the Twelfth district, -which is
composed of Harrison, Lewis and
Doddridge counties; Charles Amlon, a
prominent business man of Wheeling;
and V. T. Hanley, of Grafton, chairman
of tho Taylor county Republican com
mittee.
Mr. Gribble was enthusiastic over
the outlook for his election and for
the success of the Republican national
and state tickets. He has been look
ing things over In the Twelfth district
for the last few days and he told Secre
tary CofTman Friday that the party
was never in better shape.
Messrs. Amlen and Hanley brought
line reports of party harmony In Ohio
and Taylor counties. The success of
tho Republican tickets in these coun
ties Is certain, thoy said.

FREIGHT EMBARGO

In reporting the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company's embargo

of all kinds, except perishables, were

probably be late Saturday night or

make the acquaintance of the follow

CHARLESTON, W. Va.. Sept. 1.
? A bomb was thrown Into tho
camp of tho woman suffragists
who havo been working for tho
ratification of the suffrage amend
ment to tho state constitution to
be voted on at the November elov
tlon, when attention was called
to the fact that there had been
failure to comply with provisions
of the state constitution and that
evo nlf the cause Is overwhelm
ingly triumphant at tho pollB No
vember 7, equal suffrage cannot
be extended to women. The con
stitution of West Virginia pro
vides that the legislature when
submitting a proposal amendment
to the vote of the people, Bhall
cause tho same "to bo published
at least three months before such
election In some newspaper In ev
ery county In which a newspaper
is published. This has not been
done.
Wflst Virginia readers of tho Pitts
burg papers who have been seeing
the advertisement of Secretary of
State Heed announcing the coming
vote on the proposed suffrage amend
ment in the Bttfto papers were a bit
puzzled when they observed this. In
quiry at the capitol at Charleston
brought out the intelligence that the
Btory Is a fake cooked up by the "Dem
ocratic publicity man" at Charleston,
The advertisements have been printed
all over the tsato as required by law
and the attorney genoral promptly
said that "there is nothing in it" when
the matter was referred to him.
It would be interetslng to know
who collects from the Pittsburg papers
for this piece of fiction, the man who
invented it or his boss, the Democratic
state committee.
