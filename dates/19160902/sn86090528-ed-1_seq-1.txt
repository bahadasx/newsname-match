TOTAL LOSS
FAILED TO
TRANSFER
Neglect to Mfer Policies Cost R. K.
Knowles $1,200 in Fire Insur
ance Coin
Investigation yesterday proved that
while R. K. Knowles, owner of tho
house and contents which were com
pletely consumed by fire yesterday,
had insurance to the amount of $1,010
on tho building and $200 on the con
tents, neither was, in fact, insured
and he suffered a total loss. The dis
aster was the result of a few days
neglect. The house had recently been
moved to tho college grounds for the
purpose of accommodating four pupils
who will be in attendance this year
at the O. C.W. In its former loca
tion both building and contents had
been insured. Mr. Knowles, however,
had neglected to notify the local agent
of the removal and u; transfer in
oither ease was made, thus rendering
the policies null and of no effect. As
soon' as this condition was made
known sympathizers and friends of
the college engineert,,ramcdlatoly un
dertook to take up a collection to re-
ltnbpr.se him in part for his heavy loss
which meant all that he had. Those
who have undertaken this will resume
their labors today and hope to raise a
neat sum.
H. E. Martin, local agent of the
National Fire Insurance company of
Hartford, Conn., in which the insur
ance was held, has written the home
office stating that after investigation
he believes this to be an honest loss,
Mr. Knowles having neglected to ar
range the transfer owing to pressing
duties and speaking for the unfortu
nate owner favorable consideration at
the hands of the company.

CHICKASHA TO HAVE NEW
MANUFACTURING PLANT
The first manufacturing enterprise
of its kind to be launched in the state
of Oklahoma, Chickasha, in the near
future, is to have a modern, thorough
ly up-to-date manufacturing plant for
the production of ladies and ehiddren's
ready-to-wear garments.
This new enterprise is being launch
ed here by Joseph Gerstenfield, form
erly of Chickasha, but who, during the
past two years, has been located at
several points in the east where he
has been connected in this line of
manufacture, returning here recently.
After rejecting several propositions
which were made to him to locate his
manufactory at Kansas City, Memphis
Dallas, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, he
finally settled on Chickasha as the
logical point, the growth and success
of the factory depending on the qua i
ty ot the labor available and support
which will be given for the operation
of such a plant.
The location of the new factory is
on north Third street. It is being
thoroughly equipped with the mo.it
modern machinery and appliances us
ually employed in a plant of its kind

Remarkable Tale of Democratic

WILSON ASSURED
OF RE-ELECTION
Record ot Peace, Happiness and Pros

Will Win Election
By United Press.
Washington, Sept. 2 Senator James
today assured President Woodrow
Wilson when notifying him of. his
renomination for the presidency oj
the democratjc ticket, that his record
for "peace, 'prosperity and happiness"
while the old world staggered be
neath a load of sorrow, insures his
re-election. "With enthusiasm, un
animity and an earnestness never
surpassed in the political life of Amer
ica, tho representatives of the purest
democracy in the world has summon
ed you again to lead the hosts of
peace, prosperity and American
righteousness" said -Senator James.
He also enumerated sonw of the ac
complishments of the present adminis
tration.
President Wilson said in part:
Senator James, Gentlemen of the no
tification Committee, Fellow Citizens:
cannot accept the leadership and re
sponsibility which thw 3i .'ional Demo
ratio convention has again, in such
generous fashion, asked me to accept
without first expressing my profound
(latitude to the party for the trust it
ref oses in me after four years of fi?ry
trial in the midst of affairs of unpde
cecented difficulty, and the keen sense
of added responsibility with , which
this honour fills (I had almost said
burdens) ma as I think of the great
Issues of national life and policy in

future conduct of our government. 1
shall seek, as I have always sought
to justify the extraordinary confidence
thus reposed in mo by striving to
purge my heart and purpose of every
personal and of every misleading par
ty motive and devoting every energy
I have to the service of the nation
as a whole, praying that I may contin
ue to have the counsel and support of
all forward-looking men at every turn
of the difficult business.
For I do not doubt that the people of
the United States will wish the Dem
ocratic party to continue in control of
the government. They are not in the
habit of rejecting those who have ac
tually served them for those who are
making doubtful and conjectural prom
ises of service. Least of all are they
likely to substitute those who promis-j

ed to render them particular services
and proved false to that promise for
those who have uctiuilly rendered
tlioso very services.
Boasting is always an empty busi
ness, which pleases nobody but the
boaster, and I have no disposition to
boast of what tho Democratic party
has accomplished. It lias merely done
it duty. It has merely fulfilled its ex
plicit promises. But there can bo no
violation of good taste in calling at
tention to the manner in which those
promises have been carried out or in
adverting to the interesting fact that
many of the things accomplished were
what tho opposition party had again
and again promised to do but had left
undone. Indeed that is manifestly
part of tho business of this year of
reckoning and assessment. There 1h
no moans of Judging tho future except
by assessing the past. Constructive
action must bo weighed against de
structive comment and reaction. The
Democrats either have or havo not
understood the varied interests of tho
country. The test is contained in the
record.
What is that record? What were
the Democrats called Into power to
do? What things had long waited to
bo 'done, and how did the Democrats
do them It is a record ot extraordi
nary length airl verlety, rich In ele
ments of many kinds, but consistent
in principle throughout and suscepti
ble of brief recital.
The Republican party was put out
of power because of failure, practical
failure and moral failure; because it
had served special Interests and not
the country at large; because, under
the leadership of its preferred and es
tablislid guides, of those who still
make its choices, it had lost touch
with the thoughts and the needs of
the nation and was living In a past
age and under a fixed illusion, the il
lusion of greatness.
Anti-Trust Laws.
The laws against trusts have been
clarified by definition, with a view to
making it plain that they were not di
rected against big business but only
against unfair business and the pre
tense of competition where there was
none; and a trade commission has
been created with powers of guidance
and accommodation which havo re
lieved business, men of unfouuded
fears and set them upon tho road of
hopeful and confident enterprise.
By the Federal Reserve Act the Blip
ply of currency at the dlsposul of ac
tive business has been rendered elas
tic.
Effective measures have been taken

merchant marine and the revival of
