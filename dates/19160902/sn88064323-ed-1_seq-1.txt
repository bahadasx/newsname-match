PAYING HIGH PRICE FOR
UNPREPAREDNESS.
The American people have no
adequate conception of their un
prepared netra, and only an inkling
of the high price ihey are paying
for it. C.ingress ih just passing,
and President Wilson will soon
sign an aifny reorganization bill
that continues ttie national guard
as our second line of laud defense,
the regular aimy being the first.
It is wery doubtful if enough
young men will volunteer under
the proposed enlargement to give
on a guard as numerous as that of
Switzerland Bui its cost will be
many times that of Swriizerlaud's.
As the Saluiday liveuiug l'osl
puts it —
''The Uoiied States is urged to
adopt Switzerland's system of
preparedness for war. That re
public gives military instruction
in the public schools; then all
able-bodied males up to 32 years
of age are required to train for a
short period each year, after
which—up to 48—they are enroll
ed in the reserve This gives the
country a fairly efficient militia,
whose fiist line comprises about
200,000 men—although figures
that pretend to be aut limitative
vary considerably—with a reserve
about as numerous
"Now the cost of this system,
in the last year before the war,
was a lut le over #8.000,000. For
a H'sr line militia less numerous
than Switzerland's, and doubiless
less efficient, we propose to pay
out of the federal treasury #75,
000 000 a year, in addition to
whatever sums the 48 states ex
pend.
"Is that not something besides
the militia in Switzerland's sys
tem that we might adopt!"
The chief reason for the vast
difference in cost is that we pro
pose to hire men to volunteer—to
tempt them into the service with
offers of increased pay—while
Switzerland compels its citizens to
render service as a duty to the
state.
To the yonng American we say,
"You can render military service
or not; we leave it all to you."
To the Swiss boy bis government
says: "You must take physical
training in school; and when you
are 20 years of age you must en
roll in the citizen army for the
country's safety and defense."

BURKE PLACE SOLD.
Oo last Saturday the Burke
Place, in the Fifth ward of this
parish was sold at Sheriff Sale to
satisfy judgments aggregating,
exclusive of interest and attorney's
fees, #28,872 58. The property
was composed of several small
tracts which were purchased and
oombined by the late E A. Pharr.
The Jas L Burke Place, * at
Burke Station, on the Morgan's
La & Tex R R was the central
point aronnd which the other
properties clustered.
The Nelson properties were sub
sequeutly acquired. These tracts,
some three of them, origioally con
Htltûted the holdings of William
Nelson, the father of Paul Nelson,
the latter having been the last
Chief of the Obarenton Indians
They were absorbed by the Burke
Place.
The Peebles plantation, compos
ed principally of Section 32, less
some 80 acres, carried the aggre
gate acreage op to nearly a thou
sand acres. These lands were lo
cated on the west shore of Span
ish Lake and embraced some of
the richest farm land in this pat
isb.
According to vatious estimates
placed npon the property, the
place was worth between forty
five and fifty thousand dollars in
normal times. It was devoted
principally to the growing of cane.
The loss of several cane crops by
adverse weather conditions, fol
lowed by inimitable Bogar legisla
tion of the past three years,
brought abont those conditions
which sent the place under the
hammer. The Leon Godchaux
Co, Limited, was foreclosing
creditors and the only bidder at
the sale. The property was adju
dicated to them at their only bid
of #25,050.

THE LANDRY WRECK,
The East-bound California
de Luxe Crashes into a
•Switching Freight Train,
in a Blinding Hain.
On last Monday afternoon the
people of this city were thrown
into a fever of excitcmet by the
reception of the news that the
California de Luxe train east
bound had cut a switeh.ng;
freight tram in two, derailed and
ZT, i t, t t Lux % ,ocon f' v e
and demolished some fonr of five
tre ght cars some two miles west
of the New Iberia railroad depot
and about a mile east of Segura
station. The de Luxe engine
broke away from its train and
rolled over onto Its side in the
neutral g-round between the double
tracks. The engineer and firemen
of the overturned engine, unaided,
crawled out of their cab, a bit
confused and somewhat dazzed by
the experience.
The freight, bound westwaid,
was ordered to take the sidetrack
at this point so as to allow passen
ger train No. 7 to go ahead of the
freight. After No. 7 weut through, !
the freight proceeded to get back I
ght, pr
on to tier track
The switch at this point lays on
the south side of the double track.
In order to get back to the track
('he northern side of the double
track ) to take np her course west
ward, she had to pull across the
southern side of the double track.
Before the southern track could be
cleared the de Luxe train ap
proached on the south side track,
running at 30 miles per hour. A
blinding rain was falling at the
time The de Luxe train cut the
freight train in two at the point
where there were several cars
loaded with lumber. The de
Luxe locomotive wrecked and
scattered tins lumber in a manner
not easy to described, and buried
her forward end into the softened
earth.
Two oil tank cars were caught
in the crash They were thrown
across the parish road, which par
alleled the rail road right ot way
on the uorth side. It is possible
that these tanks were effective
in tearing down telegraph and
telephone lines.
Not a car of the passeuger train
left the track, and no one was
hurt seriously enough to require
the services of a surgeon.
Mr. Landry was the engineer in
charge of the de Luxe flyer and
Albert Berry was his fireman.
They were the only two at ail
hurt. Landry complained of a
hurt in his back and Berry was
bruised about the face. Conduc
tor liosseaii was in charge of the
passeuger train.
It is gathered that the flagman
of the switching freight was very
properly ahead of his train, but,
possibly due to the downpour of
rain, his signals were not seen by
the engineer of the passenger
traiu.
The wrecking train was soon on
its way to the scene of the disas
ter and in a few hours the tracks
were again clear for t brougb traffic

KING GOTTON'S RETURN
The cotton gin at this place is
again in full blast, and it looks
something like old times to see
wagons loaded with cotton in the
seed coming in to the gin. Messrs.
Voorhies & Bergerie are the pro
prietors of the gin and are doing
very well so far. They have just
started and up to last Saturday
they had turned oat 34 bales,
bought 50,000 lbs of seed cotton,
and sold a carload of seed to the
Altxandria mill. They paid as
high as $53 for cotton and got as
mach as #34 per ton for their seed.
Sandoz & Suberbielle, the corn
buyers here, bought some 2000
bis of corn last week, paying
00 per bbl of 144 lbs The
corn was then put through the
sheller and made ready for ship
ment. The yield of corn has been
very good this year throughout
this section as we gather from all
reports coming to ns from all di
rections. At the prices paid for
the grain there should be a world
of dollars released to the farmers
of this section this season, if ship,
ping is not too long suspended by
the threatened railroad tie up.
a
On Monday this section was
visited by a good rain, tboronghly
settling the dust and meeting all
needs On Tuesday we bad an
other rain that might well be class
ed as a "galley washer." Ou Wed
nesday evening the cloads gather
ed in the north aid east and as
sumed a very threatening aspect,
bat, they passed over without gtv
ing np any ot their moisture at
this point.

WOMAN'S RIGHT.
Word and Works:
The greatest right of woman is
to love and cherish her own; every
care possible should be given, and
every influence used over thosé in
her domain before another call is
answered. This is a sacred task
that cun never be neglected for a
lower one, except at the peril of
the most beautiful of human at
tainmeuui, a womanly, a motherly
woman. What work in the world
is greater or exerts a greater influ
euce than the mother's care? The
home needs the right kind of per
sonal influence; this begins before
words are understood, aud like all
silent influences, will be the most
deep seated.
Many children are twisted into
unnatural shapes, and their shaip
angles must be rubbed into shape
by coming in coutact with solid
facts, that nature give us for the
correction of those who are so un
fortunate as to be forced into ill
fitting paths by an unnatural
training Natural fitness for a
vocation is a priceless advantage;
mental tendencies usually mam.
fest themselves early. But there
is a difference betweeu a taste and
a talent, aud many parents make a
mistake ui pushing their children
into a life of their own cbosing
Barents' love should not control so
much as it should inspire Love
must not fail to let the soul woik
out its own salvation.—J W.

Saved Girl's Life
"I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. I firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went in on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble.- I shall never be without
BUÄ-DÄHT
In my home." For constipation, indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black
Draught It is a medicine of known merit Seventy-five
years of splendid success proves its value. Good for
^ young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.
