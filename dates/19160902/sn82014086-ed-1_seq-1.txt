Strong Conviction Prevails That in the End the House
Bill Will Go Thrugh the Senate Without a Change.
Washington, Sept. 1. Prevention of
the threatened railroad strike through
an act of conpress seemed assured to
night, after the house, by an over
whelming vote had parsed the Adam
son eight hour day law and the sen
ate had agreed to take a final vote on
the measure not later than six o'clock
tomorrow evening.
Conferences May Be Necessary.
Although it is possible that senate
amendment may make conferences
necessary, it Is generally believed on
both sides of the capitol that when
the test comes the house bill as
it etand3 will be accepted and rush
ed to Shadow Lane, X. J., for Presi
dent Wilson's signature. And, while
no formal announcements were forth
coming from the employes brother
hoods tonight, it is authoritatively
stated that this will result in immed
iate dispatch of code messages call
ing off the general strike ordered for
Monday morning.
Passed House by Vote of 239 to 56.
The Adamson bill as passed in the
house by a vote of 239 to 56, with
minor amendments, is the same
measure which the brotherhoods'
leaders officially declared yesterday
would constitute a "satisfactory settle
ment" and prevent the strike. The
amendments, added to conform to a
draft framed by the senate interstate
commerce committee, would fix the ef
fective date January 1 instead of De
cember 1, 1916. and exempt railroads
lfiss than 100 miles long and electric
street and interurban lines. Briefly,
it provides: . .. .
Eight Hours a Day's Work.
"That eight hours shall be deemed
a day's work and the standard for
reckoning compensation of railroad
employes operating trains in inter
state commerce after January 1, 1917;
and
Commission of Three
"That a commission of three ap
pointed by President Wilson shall in
vestigate the effects of the eight hour
standard from six to nine months and
then report to congress, present wages
not to be reduced during the investi
gation or for thirty days thereafter
and overtime to be paid at a pro rata

Red Tape Eliminated.
Red tape was eliminated as far as
possible to rush the measure over
to the senate which after several hours
of lively discussion over a bill report
ed by its interstate commerce commit
tee, had recessed until eight o'clock.
When the senate reconvened the house
legislation was there awaiting action
Senate in Night Session.
The senate committee bill, drafted
during a late session last night, and
another this morning,. was the Adam
son measure with the same" amend
ments adopted todajr by the house and
an added section empowering the In
terstate Commerce Commission to fix
the wages of interstate railroad em
ployes at the end of the proposed per
iod of investigation and thereafter.
At the outset of the night session,
Senator Newlands sought and ob
tained unanimous consent to put aside
the senate bill and take up the one
.t over from the house, thereby
ving the way for quick final action
vithout parliamentary formalities that
otherwise would be necessary. Then
Senator Underwood brottgfit ""tip ""' the'
issue over which, tha senate is divided
by proposing as an amendment the
rate fixing provision of the discarded
senate bill.
Debate Lasted Three Hours.
Over this amendment debate waged
for three hours, Senators Newlands
and Underwood advocating it and'Sen"
ator Cummins making a long speech
criticizing the whole proceeding. Most
of the senators had little to say and
in the cloak rooms there were strong
intimations that the reason for this
was the general conviction that in the
end the house bill would go through
without change. -For- a-while there,
was talk of an all-nlghf session, but
early in the evening word was passed
that an agreement to adjourn and
vote at a certain hour tomorrow would
come before the discussion had gone
very far.
President Wilson at His Office.
All through the morning President
Wilson was at his office in the capitol

confident that his efforts had averted

SECRETARY REDFIELD ANSWERS
CHARGES OF NOMINEE HUGHES
About Removal of Office Holders For
Political Reasons.
Portland, Maine, Sept. 1. William
C. Redfield, secretary of commerce, to
night answered the charges of
Charles E. Hughes that appoint
ments to the posts of director of cen
sus and superintendent of the coast
and geodetic survey had been made
for political reasons without regard
to the efficiency of the service. It is
proper, he said, that an administra
tion should render an accoiint of its
work and the department of com
merce welcomed the most searching
inquiry and the fullest publicity.
"The republican, candidate at the
outset,' he said, "made a criticism of
two appointments in the department of
commerce, alleging in substance that
they were the replacing of effective,
scietific men with political ap
pointees. And these illustrations
were used to show how the adminis
tration had abused the power of ap
pointment by replacing good men with
worse. I would not trouble you with
this matter were it not that the re
publican candidate in two important
cities spoke and spoke again of these
things in a manner contrary to the
facts and the records. The whole sub
ject Is as open as the day and I have
reason now to know that from within
his own party circles the candidate has
learned that he was misinformed.
"The incident, trifling in itssclf,
however, shows that the candidate is
willing to snatch at any straw and
without inquiry make baseless asser
tions affecting the fitness and worth
of honorable gentlemen whom the open
records show to be efficient and loyal
public servants."

STATEMENT ISSUED
BY HOWARD ELLIOTT.
Says Labor Controversy is Now Up to
the People to Decide.
New York, Sept. 1. Howard Elliott,
president of the New York, New Haven
and Hartford Railroad company, on his
return here today from Washington,
issued a statement in which he said
that the present issues in the railroad
labor controversy had gone beyond the
questions in dispute between the em
ployes and the railroads and were now
these:
"Shall organized lahor without any
check or restraint by law have the
right to force its decision upon the
public regardless of the welfare of the
public?
"Shall organized labor settle disputes
in which it Is interested by force, or
use the peaceful methods of court and
arbitration tribunals in use in all other
disputes In this country?
"These two great questions," his
statement continued, "should be set
tled, not by the leaders of the labor
organizations, not by the presidents of
the railroads, but calmly and without
excitement by the whole people
through congress or by some instru
mentality creared by congress."
Organized labor as well as organized
capital must "recognize the rjght of
100,000,000 people in this country," he
said.
NEW YORK SUBWAY
TRAINMEN THREATEN STRIKE
Unless Officers of Corporation Consent
to Meet Committee from Union.
New York, Sept. 1. Three thousand
motormen and conductors employed on
the elevated and subway lines of the
Interborough . Rapid Transit company
Voted tonight o suspend work at once
unless the officers of the corporation
consent to meet a committee from the
union. The ultimatum will be pre
sented next Tuesday.
The employes contend that President
Theodore P. Shonts and General SVIan
ager Frank Hedley have failed to keep
an agreement into which they entered
on Aug. 7 to meet a committee repre
senting the workers who had become
members of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Street and Electric Railway
Employes. The men assert that the
Interborough has devoted its energies
to forming an "inside organization"
and inducing the motormen and con
ductors to sign "master and man" con
tracts which bind them for a stated
period.
The Interborough employes declare
they will be backed Sn their demand by
the union wor leers of the New York
Railways company, a subsidiary of the
Interborough, whose differences with
that company have been submitted to
arbitration after a tacit but not a for
mal recognition of the union by the
directors and officers of the company.
The -ultimatum to the Interborough
was decided upon in - the face of a
wage increase , aggregating $1,750,000
whichfcagejjbeen made since Jan. 1.

Because It Goes
Speaking of fraternal societies and the press a speaker in a na
tional convention advocated the use of display advertising In the news
papers for the purpose of aiding the growth of the organization. This
was done "because the newspaper is the greatest educational medium
of the times. It moulds public opinion. I would advise using the
columns of the daily newspaper for advertising because it goes direct
ly into the homes of the people. Tou can centralize your publicity
and cover territory to good advantage."
The advice of the fraternal society worker Is only what must be
that of the observant person who is seeking to get the attention of the
reading public. The more people reached the better the results and no
more far-reaching agent can be secured than the newspaper, and in
this part of Connecticut there is no paper which goes into more homes
than The Bulletin. It is the medium for getting results.
In the past week the following matter has appeared in its columns:

WESTERN RALROADS
RESCIND FREIGHT EMBARGO
Convinced That Congress Will Force
Them to Surrender.'
Chicago, Sept. 1. Convinced that
congress will force them to surrender,
presidents of important western rail
roads tonight ordered rescinding or
modification, of the freight embargo es"
tab'.ished in preparation for a general
railway strike. At the same time the
railroad executives announced defec
tions from the ranks of the railway
brotherhoods and declared they had
enough men to operate trains, strike or
no strike. This was denied by broth
erhood officials.
Hale Holden, president of the Chi-v
cago, Burlington and Quincy, and
spokesman for the railroads in the
conferences with President Wilson,
said the railroads are convinced con
gress will force through the eight hour
day law before the date set for the
strike, but that they are going ahead
with plans to operate trains in event
of a strike.
Modifications of the freight embargo
were announced here by the Erie and
the Rock Island systems. Other roads
were expected to take similar action
within a few hours.
While the railroad executives were
claiming the defection of thousands
of brotherhood members, officials of
the unions, through Timothy Shea,
vice president of the Brotherhood of
Firemen and Enginemen, said the rail
ways habitually circulate such stories
and they have no fears that their men
would not obey the Ftrlke call.
