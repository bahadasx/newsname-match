pupils will be on the first floor in
stead of the third and the labors
tory will be in the stage dressing
room. There will be 550 pupils to
provide for this term, or about 150

the Catholic Parochial School.

II Pittsburg, Pa., Aug. 25, 1916.
a Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
I- As-you have not written to me to
t. cease ilring, 1 shall now write an-q
e other letter. I most sincerely hope
r, that you have lost no subscribers on
i- account of my writings. )f I could,
n however, write as 'rapidly as the
movie actors do, I would be chain
lightning--and then some.
It surely made me feel glad to get
e the good news that the good people
, of Covington and the Third Ward
had voted the tax for school work.
SWhen I remember that thousands of
dollars have ibeen spent to educate
the children of some citizens, against
school taxes, in some ,parts of our
parish, and know that thousands of
I dollars have been paid to some of the
11 children of the same citizens, because
the said children are teachers I won
der how some people can deliberate
e ly place a premium upon ignorance.
It may surprise a majority of your
Sreaders to learn that on the board
of education of this great city, there
are three women and nine men.
t When my term of office expires upon
the parish school board, 1 hope, Iif
possible, t4 be succeeded by a wo- f
man. There are several women in
Slidell who have the ability, and
would make excellent material for
school board work. There are also
numbers of other good women work- i
ers for civic improvement in our
parish, six of whom are members of
the board of directors of the St.
Tammany Parish Fair Association.
'It is needless to say thht I am a
"suffragette" any way.
. The more I see of this great city,
e the more 4 like 'it, and become more
impressed with the Pittsburgh spirit
that promotes progress-co-opera
tion. Concentrated effort, looking
to substantial town improvement, is e
e needed at home, and if properly ap- c
plied will surely bring good results. a
'eLet George do it" will never help e
us.
The tonnage of this city is greater a
than that of New York, London, r
Hamburg and Marsailles (the strong- t
eat maratime ports in the world) '
combined. It is the strongest bank- t
ing city in the United States, and r
also has two of the largest steel car,
plants in the world, besides num
erous other largest world industries. I
The FitsBimons family are Pitts- I
burgers, so you can teadily see some 4
of the origin of the spirit of progress d
now in Covington. t
I read in one of the local papers i
a few days ago that the daily con
sumption of fruits and vegetables, in 1
season, amounts to $1125,000. One a
firm alone handles twelve million IC
cenateloupes a season, and right now t
is the season. This -looks as if the t
high cost of living is not considered, t
but as Mrs. McDlniel once said to 1
the writer, "it is not so much the 1
high cost of living, as the cost of liv- ' t
ing hith." We all know that furs, S
diamonds, tobacco and other necessi
ties of life are advancing in price, but e
there is some consolation in the fact d
that Henry Flivers cost less and wo- i
men's dresses are to be longer-not
shorter. e
In the country ih which this city
is situated there are nearly one hun
dred eities and towns, and several g
of the nearest have been taken into a
this corporation. This brings to my
mind the hope that Slidell will an- e
nex the towns of Marcel Cousin, Dr. I'
Farmer and Henry Schnelder. We A
need them in our business.' 9
"Right here," has been my daily
answer at roHll-call since July 4th.
I prefer to live the simple life, rath
er than to be on the go. Next week
I may ran into Michigan, for a few.
days, to visit some of my kin folk.
May also stop at IDetroit to say howdy
to 'rits Bralmen and family, and also
look in on the. Sldell colony there

FIRE DESTROYS
BURRIS HOTEL
FRANKLINTON
Other Property Destroyed.
Loss Estimated About
Fifteen Thousand.
franklinton, La.. Aug. 29.--Fire
was discovered at 12:30 this morn
ing in the ground floor of the two
story brick building opposite the
courthouse square on Main street,
owned and occupied as a grocery by
Simon 8. Thomas, of Hackley, La.
While discovered soon after starting,
the flames spread so rapidly that it
was at once seen that there was no
chance to save the building. The
Burris Hotel, a large two-story frame
building adjoining on the north side,
soon caught fire and the picture show
building, a wooden structure, on the
south side. Both w~ere destroyed.
Considerable damage was done to the
walls and roof of the FParmers' and
Merchants' Bank building, situated
on the corner in the same block.
The loss by the fire will approxi
mate $15,000, with insurance of
about 49300, distributed as follows:
Burris Hotel, two-story frame build
ing, owned by H. W. Magee, valued
at $5500, and insured for $3000,
movie show, frame building, owned
by Will and Wiley Burris, valued at
$500, no insurance; Bimon S. Thom
as' two-story brick store and office
building, valued at $3000, insurance
'$2000; two-story bank and office
building, owned by the Union Bank,
valued at $7000, not a total loss, in
surance $3,500.
Mrs. Lauro O. Nelms, proprietor
of the Burris Hotel, saved a large
part of her furniture and Iixtures,
but they were badly damaged in be
ing removed from the building, and
her loss will be around .500, as she
carried no insurance.
Simon S. Thomas openad a grocery
and feed store some four months ago
in the ground door Qf his building,
where' the fire originated. He car
ried $800 on his stock and fixtu es,
and his loss is supposed to be fairly
well covered.
There seems to be no doubt of he
dre being of incendiary origion, but
thete is no clue to the guilty person.
'Ihe one who discovered the lire said
he saw a light in the building, at&
In a few minutes there was an ex
plosion and the whole lower floors
were enveloped in dames.
