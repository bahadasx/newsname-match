The man who was drowned off the
steamer Greenland Just above the elty
Thursday night proved to be J. Erwln
oi Cincinnati.
The man was with a party that had
been shipped from Cincinnati to work
on the dam Just obove the city. He
was drunk and fell overboard. The
men that he was with knew him only
by the name of Humpty. Yesterday
the contractors received a letter from
the employment agency In Cincinnati
giving the name of the ones that had
been shipped. The name of J. Erwin
was not answered when called so it
was tlocided that the drowned i .un
must have been the possessor of that
cognomen.
Coroner Charles Slack yesterday no
tified Chief of Police Copeland of Cin
cinnati of the drowning and asked
him to try to locate the relatives of
the man. The body has been embalm
ed and is now being held at the un
dertaking parlors, of Coughlln ft Co
