Shadow Lawn, Long Branch, N. J.,
K'pt. 2. Overhanging clouds with an
occasional spatter of rain greeted
President Wilson today when he arose
lrepnred to take up the party cudgel
aud begin his fight for re-election. A
land breeze from the southwest indicat
ed the day would be warm. A low mist
hung over the ocean. It forecast pos
sible showers to mar the gala notifica
tion ceremony scheduled for 4 o'clock
.this afternoon.
Despite the cloudy weather, however,
the president and Mrs. Wilson emerged
from the mansion early for a stroll
about the grounds. The beautiful
Mindow Lawn estate was ablaze with
color.
Gay bunting and streaming banners
hung from every window and cornice
end about the lawns were hundreds of
-American flags strenming from tall
poles.
Thousands of chairs had been set on
the lawn facing the east veranda, from
which the president spoke: Secret serv
ice men, special deputies and police
men from New York and Philadelphia
were scattered about the grounds long
before the crowds began to assemble.
A total of more than 200 men had been
assigned to the task of guarding tha
president.
Keeps Track of Congress.
Immediately after breakfast the
president called for the morning papers,
to read the latest developments in con
gress regarding the legislation which
he had prop&sed as a means of averting
the strike. During the night telegrams
had been received from Washington
telling of the senate agreeing to tnke a
vote on the bills not later than 6
o'clock this afternoon.
In the meantime automobiles and ve
hicles of all descriptions laden with
joyful democrat-s had begun to arrive
in increasing numbers and amid in
Creasing din. If the weatherman had
plotted to dampen the ardor of the oc
casion he was sadly fooled. Horns, cow
hells and various other racket devices
contributed a rnncus chorus to the gen
eral pandemonium and long" before the
noon hour, voices were hoarse from
cheering.
It was a strange scene oet in this col
ony of stately mansions, back amid
groves of towering cedars and ningnif-'
iceut hedges. Across the road from
Shadow Lawn is the magnificent sum
mer estate of Murray Guggenheim. On
every side are the homes of multi-millionaires,
in front of which trnmpled
lusty voiced democrats from all parts
of Hie country.
Dissension In New Jersey.
The president was confronted the
fir.it thing today by a party snag when
the state democratic committee called to

the central figure- in an anmaioliile
parade on his arrival shii'jy after
eight o'clock, and was to speak at a
luncheon under the auspices of the
business men's league at the Missouri
Athletic club. Late in the afternoon
he was to shake hands with the public
at tho Hotel Jefferson and at night
peak in the Coliseum. Tomorrow he
will rest, leaving at night for Nash
ville. Thoso close to- the candidate indicat
ed today that the governor intended
particularly to dwell on the principle
of exclusive federal control of the
militia which he enunciated at last
night's meeting at Kansas City and on
the Mexican policy aud speeches dur
ing the next tew days. He intends, it
was said, more specifically to outline
exactly what measures he advoates to
correct the abuses in government which
he ascribes to the democratic adminis
tration. Governor Hughes has been
considerably riled over dinocratie
declarations that his campaign so far
has exhibited mostly complaints with
out indicating corrective and construc
tive remedies. Tonight he proposes to
answer these declarations, while still
thrusting away in critical analysis of
what he considers democratic effici
ency. Talks to Businessmen.
In his address to members of the
businessmen's league nt the Missouri
Athletic club association, Hughes said
the time had arrived in national pro
gress when "capital and labor must
cooperate with a sense of their mutual
dependence."
"Labor and capital are but two
phases of one great problem which all.
as expressed in the declaration of in
dependence are trying to solve the fact
that in American life cooperation and
efficiency are the keynote words of
the dnv." It must be cooperation with
a sense of mutual dependence."
Referring to labor and capital dis
putes, Hughes declared that the two
must go up or down together.
''Capital and labor cannot get along
in antagonism," he said. "There will
ahvavs bo differences, but these dif
ferences must not be in a deep sense ot
class antagonism."
Candidate Hughes declared that this
countrv was suffering from "vagne
legislation." Ho said one drawback
in the settlement of problems is the
"indefinite form in legislation. The
expressions used in legislative acts are
in vaguo terms and do not meet the
demands of the time."
Hughes said it was his ambition to
aid in defining legislation affecting
business so that the public would have
a fair and clear idea as to the facts
and the legislation could not be mis
construed. Hughes declared he be
lieved in the patriotic sentiments of
the business men of the nation.

HUSTING OF WISCONSIN
PUTS IT IN NUT SHELL
Saying "Our Chief Interest Is
To Avert This Impending
Calamity"
Washington, Sept. 2. The United
States senate spent today arguing with
itself preparatory to cgsting the votes
that will say whether or not there is
to be a nation-wide railroad strike.
While the senators argued, however,
they were practically agreed that their
votes would be against such a strike.
They were prepared to put their O. K.
on the preventative legislation pro
posed by the president and endorsed
by the house.
By nightfall a new federal eight hour
day statute is expected to be part of
the law of the land, so far as the sen
ate can make it. By midnight it is ex
pected to be complete, bearing the
president's signature.
Six o'clock is the hour set for the
vote and a special, messenger is ready
to rush the measuro to tho president
down in Jersey.
The senate adjourned at 11 o'clock
last night without having finished its
work on the bill. Demands for a vote
at that time were overcome by senators
who wished to talk today. The full
galleries and the tense ntmosprere of
last night .were -not duplicated when
the session opened today, but there was
reason to believe the crowds would
gather again to -witness the closing
hours of deliberation and the history
making vote.
Debate This Afternoon.!
There was to be two hours of gen
eral debate with thirty minutes
speeches beginning at noon. Voting on
amendments was to start at four
o'clock. At or before 0 o'clock, ac
cording to the number of amendments,
the senate- will vote on the bill itself,
which provides for an eight hour day
at the present rate of pay, and appoint
ment of a commision to investigate and
report within six to eight months on
the finnnciul results of the operation
of the law.
The Admanson measure was given
precedence in the senate when no ob
jection was made to consideration of
the house'measnre in place of the long

merce committee. While a close vote
was expected on Senator Underwood's
amendment authorizing the interstate

pay and hours of labor, it was believed

Some ' ' Suppositions. ' '
Senator Shafroth opened the debate
today by moving to change Seuator
underwood s amendment so that it
would be specifically stated no em
ploye affected by the bill would be
compelled by its terms to work, that
stopping of work would not constitute
"delaying or obstructing operation of
trains, ror whicn the amendment pro
vides a fine of $5,000 or one year's
imprisonment;
"Suppose," said Senator Hardwick,
"the railroad presidents came to us
and said 'legislate us increased freight
and passenger rates, or we will stop
urruiuig au trains in tins country.
What would we do? We would not be
permitted to be coerced. "
"Why don't you republicans stop
criticising and jXer something to avert
this strike" queried Hustiag, Wis
consin. "I think we all agree on the main
question, our chief interest is to avert
this impending calamity. So we shall
do it in the only possible way by
legislatioa."
Sherman Wants Time.
Senator Shermau, Illinois, bitterly
denounced ''rushing the bill into legis
lation in a few hours when there should
be days of deliberation." "We are do
ing this under threat," he said.
To prove his point, ho read several
telegrams from large labor unions of
the middle west pleading with him to
urge passage of the eight hour law bill
and to oppose any form of compulsory
arbitration.
"I would rather be a doe and bav
at the moon," he said, "than be a sen
ator enslaved by such dictations and
threats. These messages show the way
the wind blows by demanding that 1
urge government ownership of rail
roads," .
Sherman read "other telegrams, one
from Joe Burns of the White Hats, (an
actors' association) of Chicago, and
one from a bookkeeper of the same
place. Burns urged passage of the
eight hour law.
"Tlrls means," continued Sherman,
"that if we legislate for the railway
employes, we'll have to do it for every
other labor organization. ' It will never
end. We might as wel wipe the inter
state commerce commission out of ex
istence. The poor bookkeeper in Chicago
gets the true sense of this whole situa
tion when he wants me to vote against
it. He says if congress passes this
bill it will have to keep on, he, with
other poor bookkeepers, paying the
price."
Underwood Amendment. Beaten.
The Underwood amendment which
would have given the interstate com
merce commission power to fix wages
and hours of labor of all interstate
railway employes was voted down by
14 to sr.
This was the first vote taken in con
nection with the no strike eight hour
bill. It prcssages.leaders believe, an
overwhelming vote in favor of the bill
itself without any amendment before
0 o'clock.
Seaator Newlands' amendment pro
viding fine or imprisonment or both for
"anyone who wilfully delays or who
obstructs operation of trains'' was
beaten 52 to 14.

Chicago, Sept. 2. Strike preparation!

day. Executives do not doubt that the
senate will confirm tne action or ine
house yesterday in passing the Adamson
bill and thus postpone i strike. But
thev dan to strengthen their positions
so that if an appeal to the courts should
reverse the action of congress, tney
would be rendv to meet a strike. Be-
tweeu now aud January 1, when it be
comes effective, it is expected that
detniles of a general plan of resistance
will be worked out.
Whether the roads will ignore the
Adamson law and force the government
to sue on its enforcement or will them
selves tnke the initiative and seek re
straining has not yet been determined.
First indications of the railroads' be
lief that there will be no strike Mon
day was seen todav in the lifting of em
bargoes on perishable freight on four
western roads. The action was accepted
generally as indicating that operating
officials were convinced there would be
no strike. More are expected today.
The roads liftiue embargoes were

Ben Bowen. Milwaukee, general chair
man of the order of Railway Conductors

Run Francisco. Sent. 2. "Watchful

officials, trainmen and the public today
pending final action by the senate in its
strike prevention program. The general
feeling is that the strike will be avert

their embargoes on shipments of perish
able commodities.
This announcement brings joy to
California's fruit industries, as the
threatened tie-up came at a time when
400 cnrlouds were daily moving east

With their principal markets for choic

pelled to unload at a sacrifice in the

dermining of prices of all fruits and
vegetables, but especially of grapes.

case through Bonie unforscen conditions, ,
the strike is called. Ia addition to ex-j

London, Sept. 2. Without serious
opposition by tho Austrians, Rumanian
troops rolled steadily westward toward
the heart of Transylvania today whilo
the war clouds dropped lower rove
Greece. '
The capture of , sir Transylvaniaa
towns, 1800 prisoners and lama
amounts of booty, was announced in an,
official statement from the Rumanian
war office. The Austrian war office
admitted the. surrender of Hermann
stadt, ormer capital of Transylvania to
the invaders and the evacuation of the
town of Sepsi-St. Gyoergy.
German residents of Athens have
fled from the Greek capital with the
arrival of thirty allied warships and
a fleet of transports in Piraeus harbor
only five miles away. An Athens dis
patch reported that great excitement
was caused in political circles by the
appearance of the warships, but car
ried nothing on the report that Kiug
Constantino had abdicated his throne.
A wireless dispatch from Roane as
serted that martial law has been de
clared In Athens and Piraeus and pre
sumably upon the arrlcal of allied
troops. King Constantlne, the dispatch
said, is seriously ill. Rome also re
ported the revolution in northern
Greece spreading through Thessaly and
Epirus, with the movoment for si
declaration of war by Oreece rapidly
gnining strength. -
In every theatre ' of war, except .
south of the Sommc, the allied war of
fices reported victories today. The
British war office announced the re
capture of ground lost under a heavy
German counter attack Thursday night.
The French admitted yielding somes
ground to tho Germans south of the
Somme. From both Vienna and Petro
grad came reports of Russian gains ia
the new Galiciun offensive. An un
official dispatch from Athens reported
the Herbs driving back the Bulgarian
right wing.
Allies Land Troops at Athens
London, Sept. 2. Anglo-French,
troops are believed to have been land
ed at Piraeus with tne intention oi
marching five miles northeast to
Athens and gnrr'iBoning the Greek cap
ital. No roport of an actual landing has
thus for been received. But two dis
patches from Athens today reported
the arrival of allied transports off Pir
aeus harbor and London newspapers
declared this undoubtedly meant that
tho allies had decided to put an end"
to pro-German intriguo at Athens.
Tho foreign office today still lacked
confirmation or reports or, jvmg Con
stantino's abdication and was without
further advices regarding the progress
of tho revolution in northern Greece.
In the absence of official news, diplo
mats here began to doubt the truth
of the report that Greek king hud quit
