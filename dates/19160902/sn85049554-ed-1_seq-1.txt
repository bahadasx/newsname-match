frank than any of the others in the
senate in discussing the' le !s'atlon.
He was too frank to suit the presi

"We are paying the price of peace,"
he said, bluntly. "We are to pass
bill about which no senator on this
floor kn6Ws'anything.' If you want to
settle this controversy solely from tlio
viewpoint of the organizations of labor,
then pass this eight-hour bill and stop
there. There will be no strike next

"But you will not have settled the

is the way to do it, but I see a higher
duty anead, a duty to the public."
Mr. Underwood championed the last
efforts to. get something (for. the rail
roads and the public in return for the
concessions that are being made to or

Long Branch. N. J., Sept. 2.—Presi
dent Wilson came to his summer home
here today to receive the official notifi
cation that he was the nominee of the
democratic party for president. Build
ings were draped with' flags and the
entire town was in holiday mood.
The notification committee was re
ceived on the lawn of the summer
home. The notification address was
delivered by Senator Ollle James.
The day was celebrated with enthu
siasm by more, than 10,000 persons. In
cluding democratic leaders from all over
the United States. President Wilson
rose early and spent the afternoon
shaking hands with party leaders and
rcnowirig friendships with New Jer
sey members of his party.
Wilson's Acceptance.
President Wilson formally accepted
his renominatlon here this afternoon
with an address recounting the legis
lative record of the democratic party,
a vigorous defense of his Mexican pol
icy, his dealings with the European
belligerents, and an outline of his view
of {America's pbllgatlons for the future.
With the members of the notification
committee, headed by Senator James,
grouped about him at Shadow Lawn,
the jiuinmer Whtle House, the Presi
dent declared the republican party was
"just the party that cannot meet the
new conditions of a new age." and that
the day of little Americanism, when
"methods of 'protection' and Industrial
nursing were the chief study of our
provincial statesmen," was past ar.d
gone.
"We can no longer indulge our tra
ditional provincialism,"' taid the presi
dent "We ate to play a leading part
in the world drama whether we wish
7tobr
PiessaEss^
€|J
not. '-We^fftwU Whd: ncit -boreosi^
"act for ourselves, not Imitate or follow
organize and Initiate, not peep about
merely to see where we can get In.
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia
tions with the .•European belligerents,
the president followed a dfclaratlon
that while property rights might be
vindicated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental rights
of humanity, never could be with this
statement:'
"The record'Is'"'clear and consistent
throughout and stands distinct and
definite for anyone to judge who wishes
to know the truth about It."
Immediately afterwards he said:
"I am the candidate of a party, but
I am above all things else an American
citizen. I neither seek the favor nor
fear the displeasure of that small alien
element amongst us which puts loyalty
to any foreign power before loyalty to
the United States."
Defends Mexican Policy.
Regarding his Mexican policy, the
president reiterated that the people of
Mexico were struggling "blindly. It
may be, and as yet ineffectually," to
free themselves from alien Interests,
"some of them Americans pressing for
things they could never have got in
their own country." and that he would
do everything In his power to prevent
anyone standing in their way.
"It Is hard doctrine," said he, "only
for those who wish to get something
for themselves out of Mexco." At
another point the president said?
"Mistakes, I have no doubt, have
been made In this perplexing business,
but not in purpose or object." He
declared at another point:
"I am more Interested In the for
tunes of oppressed men and pitiful
women and ehildren than In any prop
erty rights whatever."
At the outset of his references to the
legislative achievements of his party,
the president enumerated the laws
placed on the statute books relating to
business, Including tariff revision, antl.
trust laws, rovsion of the banking and
currency
system, rural credits, reha
bilitation of the merchant marine and
creation of the federal trade commis
sion.
"What other party has understood
the task so well or executed it so Intel
ligently and energetically?" he asked.
"What other party has attempted It at
all? The republican feaders apparently
know of no means of assisting buSlnefs
but protection. How to stimulate It
and'put It upon a new footing of energy
and enterprise they have not sugf
gested."
At the conclusion of his review of
the party record, the president de
clared:
"This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of san
otiin* proniis®^ but it 1s not. It is a
record of promises made four years
ago and now actually redeemed In con
structive legislation." Then later he
.••aid: "We have In four years come
very n«'r to carrying out the platform
of the progressive party as well as our
own for we are also progressives."
The president's address was fome
6,000 words long, one of the most
lengthy he has delivered on any occa
sion since, taking office.
