passage of Strike Bill By
House Yesterday Sets
Pace to Follow.
FINAL VOTE ON WAY
Action of Roads in Calling
Off Embargo Indication
Tieup Will Not Come.
Washington. Sept. 2. Not later
than 6 o'clock this eveninir the
senate will ote on the Adamou
eitht-hour day hill, passed yes
terday by the house to effect a
rallintr on of the railway strike.
Th" enactment into law of enough
of President Wilson's program to pre
vent the railway strike seemed as
sured when the senate reassernhled
this morning at 10 o'clock with a pro
gram which calls fcr a vote not later
than 6 o'clock this evening. ,
It was the belief of administration
leaders that the Adamsnn bill as it
passed the house late yesterday, ap
proved by President Wilson and for
mally accepted by the labor leaders
as meeting their demands, would even
tually be accepted by the senate.
As soon as the perfected bill finally
ig passed a special messenger will
carry it to the summer White house
et Shadow Lawn so the president may
sign it.
The first amendment proposed to
day rame from Senator Shafroth,
democrat. He proposed to fix Sena
tor Underwood's amendment empow
ering the interstate commerce com
mission to make wage schedules so
that no employe would be compelled
to work for the rate prescribed.
Senator Hardwick, democrat, spoke
for the adoption of t ho Underwork!
amendment. He said congress should
provide "thnt there never "can arise
again in this country an opportunity
for any man or set of men, railroad
managers or workers to seize this
government by the throat."
Senator Thomas also proposed an
amendment to make it a misdemean
or for any person to delay or obstruct
the operation of trains, punishable by
a fine of not more than $500 or im
prisonment for not more than one
year or both.
The brotherhood leaders still de
cline to say whether they will so"'l
the cole word meaning "satisfactory
settlement" to their general chairmen
immediately upon passage of the bill
or hold it off until it is signed by the
president.
It is generally believed, however,
the message calling off the strike will
go out aa toon as both houses have
acted.
Senator Sherman Speaks.
Senator Sherman of Illinois, repub
lican, assailed the efforts of the broth
erhoods against compulsory arbitra
tion laws. "It is the senate that is put
under involuntary servitude," said he.
"I have been sought to put under in
voluntary servitude. If legislation has
fallen to so low a degree, if we are
ready so servilely to abandon our duty,
then American politics have reached
the point where the few, and not the
many, govern."
Senator Sherman charged President
Wilson with making "a petty political"
bargain on the eve of election ana
read a telegram from an actor's union
in Chicago opposing compulsory arbi
tration. "So, next," he continued, "it is the
White Hats that are to be legislated
for. If we legislate for the engineers
and flrenien and the brakemen, we
must legislate for all. from the barn
stormers to the genius who portrays
the human passion."
He pictured congress legislating
while the unions stand, stop-watch in
hand, to see that the legislation is pass
ed on time.
Senator Weeks said the brotherhood
men had put congress in the position
of "stand and deliver." He saifl he be
lieved that a majority of the trainmen
do not want a strike and that if it
were called It would last but a few
days.
Senator Hustings of Wisconsin in
sisted that congress should do some
thing to avert the country's being con-

WEEK'S DISCLOSURES
ON WHEAT SITUATION
Chicago, Sept. 2. Severe shrinkage
in the value of wheat has given un
usual interest to board of trade opera
tions in the last week. Highest prices
on the crop have Just been attained,
but have been sharply curtailed owing
chiefly to Rumania's entrance into
the war and because of the blighting
effect of the threatened railroad
strike.
Attention to the dramatic action of
Rumania was responsible for the big
gest part of the setback in wheat
prices, for at first the trade here
seemed to consider that the opening
of the Dardanelles would soon result
and that large Russian supplies for
western Europe would be forthcoming.
Such a view, however, did not appear
to prevail across the Atlantic and the
markets on this side seemed to be in
a fair way to recover, to a large ex
tent, from the boarlsh influence of the
Rumanian scare. Then the railway
strike situation became acute and with
the advent of embargo notices the
price of wheat went decidely lower.
Optimism on Thursday as to a set
tlement of the strike gave way on yes
terday to a renewal of uncertainty as
to the outcome of Washington's al

San Francisco, Sept. 2. A women's

will be open to all women who favor
the election of Woodrow Wilson.
The following officers were elected:

ClouKh. Mrs. Mary Burger, Mrs. Mar

Annette Burke, Mrs. Carrie L.

The following resolutions
Miss
Hoyt
were
unanimously adopted:
Whereas, a group of women calling
themselves the "Women's Party," but
we believe are affiliated with the Re
publican party, and organized at this
time for the purpose of working for
the election of Charles K. Hughes, have
seen fit to assail President Wilson in
resolutions which have been given
wide publicity, thus trying to prejudice
voting women against him and,
Whereas, President Wilson is the
only president who ever voted for wo
man suffrage, and no evidence has yet
been produced to show that Charles
E. Hughes ever voted for it, when it
was an issue in his home state, and,
Whereas, President Wilson has la
bored so unceasingly in the cause of
humanity, constantly facing the most
difficult problems that a president of
the United States ever had to deal
with, always upholding the dignity of
his high office and trying to do what
was best for all the people.
Therefore, be it resolved, that tho
Women's Woodrow Wilson League,
composed of voting women of Cali
fornia, deplore the action of the so
called "Women's Party" and com
mend President Wilson for the upright
manner in which he is dealing with
the question of Woman Suffrage and
assure him of our most loyal support-

WILSON SAYS
And Comes Near Carrying
Out Platform of Progres

FORMALLY NOTIFIED
Points to Clearness and Con
sistency of Record of
Foreign Dealings.
Long Branch, N. J Sept. 2. Presi
dent Wilson formally accepted his re
nomination here this afternoon with
an address recounting the legislative
record of the democratic party, a vig
orous defense of his Mexican policy,
his dealings with the European bel
ligerents and an outline of his view of
America's obligations for the future.
The day is being celebrated with
enthusiasm by more than 10,000 per
sons, including democratic leaders
from all parts of the country. A driz
zling rain fell throughout the morn
ing. President Wilson spent the fore
noon shaking hands with party lead
ers. The president's magnificent white
summer home, surrounded by 60 acrei
of lawn, presented a beautiful picture
as the arrangements for the ceremony
were completed. The house was lit
erally covered with American flags
and minting and from the tall flagpole
floated the flag of the president of the
United States. Chairs to accommo
date 5,000 persons were grouped in a
semi-circle about the house and there
was room for 20,000 more within hear
ing distance of the president's voice.
A. temporary addition to the veranda
had been erected as the president's
ppcakin??" stand.' Several hours before
the time for the ceremony, 4 o'clock,
the gates were thrown open and
crowds poured In.
Members of th notification commit
tee, headed by Senator James of Ken
tucky, arrived hero in a body from
New York this morning and members
of the democratic national committee
and of President Wilson's cabinet ar
rived on every train.
Speaker Champ Clark and a few
other members of congress who had
planned to come were forced to re
main in Washington because of the
impending legislation. The president
was In communication with the White
house throughout the morning. He
entered into the preparations for his
notification in an optimistic frame of
mind. After an early morning walk
about the estate with Mrs. Wilson, he
received members of the New Jersey
state committee and at 1 o'clock en
tertained at luncheon 200 democratic
leaders from different parts of the
country.
With the members of the notification
committee headed by Senator James
grouped about him at Shadow Lawn,
the summer White house, the presi
dent declared the republican party was
"Just the party that cannot meet the
new conditions of a new age" and that
the day of Little Americanism when
"methods of 'protection' and industrial
nursing were the chief study of our
provincial statesmen" was past end
gone.
"Wo can no longer Indulge our tra
ditional provincialism" said the presi
dent. "We are to play a leading part
in the world drama whether we wish
it or not. We ehall lend, not borrow;
act for ourselves, not imitate or fol
low; organize and initiate, not peep
about merely to see where we may get
in."
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia
tions with the European belligerents
the president followed a declaration
that while property rights might be
vindicated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental rights
of humanity never could be, with this
statement:
"The record Is clear and consistent
throughout and stands distinct and
definite for anyone to Judge who
wishes to know the truth about It."
Immediately afterward he said:
"I am the candidate of a party, hut I
am above all things else an American
citizen. I neither seeh the favor nor
fear the displeasure of that small aliei
element amongst us which puts loyalty
to any foreign power before loyalty to
the United States."
Regarding his Mexican policy the
president reiterated that the people of
Mexico were struggling "blindly it may
beand as yet ineffectually" to free
themselves from alien Interests "some
of them Americans pressing for things
they could never have got in their own
