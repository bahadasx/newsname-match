For years the Pennsylvania com

charges that It has been harrassed
nnd persecuted by the organization,
the suit is brought under the provi

cit' W prepaied for the strike that
K threatened to begin Monday morn

Food prices have advanced rapidly

to the consumer for 00 rents a peck

DEVF'.op.MK.TS In the nation
wide strike stulus drew several
knots cut of the IdcmI situation ester
(l.iy and optimism licxnn to creep out
hist night for the first time in seveial
days. Shippers and railroad men ex
pect the commercial tangle to be
further Htruightc ncd today by raising
of emliaigos by the railroads.
The food situation remained al
moHl unchanged with the exception
that housewives stocked up on canned
goods, of which there is a heavy
supply, rather than on perishables.
Railroads mado no new announce
ments and local officials as well as
Hhipperss marked time until congress
set thu thing a-going again.
Leading retail concerns put their
foot down upon the raise in food
prices which started Thursday and
as a result tho day closed with ((no
tations similur to those of Thursday
night. Wholesale grocers prevented
advances in sugar nnd canned goods
whllo meat deulers stuck resolutely
to old prices.
Until the middle or the afternoon
Mr. Tulsa and his wife continued
their determined attack upon grocers
and meat dealers of the city. As a
general rule, retailers met them un
flinchingly, selling out entire stocks,
restocking and selling out again.
I'nprecodentcd business was trans
acted by every grocery dealer In the
city. Hundreds of housewives
stocked up their larders for weeks
to come.
No prices raised but several com
modities, chief of which was the com
mon Irish potato, were put upon tho
list of gonc-hut-not-forirotten. It was
estimated lust night that there was
not a grocer In the city who bad a
potato In his store und wholesale sup
plies were completely exhausted early
In the duy.
Meats enjoyed a big run, It being
estimated by leading packing houses
that tho dully consumption in Tulsa
Tor the past two days has been greuter
than the usual week's demand. Ar
mour & Co.. ono of the leading com
panies, lias been selling a carload a
day.
Up until yesterday Armour & Co.
has been getting In incuts regularly
despite tho embargoes and four cars
were received by them last night.
No prices advanced on meats other
than M cent a pound on wholesale
bacon and hums has been posted.
One-fourth cent a pound raise on lard
Is being asked the retailer.
Butter and eggs were running low
lust night and only some alleviation
within the next two or three days will
suvo difficulty in that (iiiurtcr. IUit
tci was ruised In varying degrees yes
terday. One wholesale produce concern sold
out Its stock of butter at an increase
of 3 '-i cents, making It necessary for
the retailer to sell at 4! cents a pound.
Others held It down to 40 cents a
pound. Eggs advunced slightly In
somo (iiurters.
Fruits nnd vegetable ran low lh
tho wholesalers as a result of Ihe
duv's abnormal demand and some
concerns were out ol all fruits except
apples.
One saving condition of tho rush
for reserve mado by woin''n of iho
city yesterday was that Instead of de
manding the perlshuble foodstuffs
they turned their attention to laying
In a supply of canned good.1 of every
desjritplon.
Produce deulers were low on fruits
and vegetables. The housewives d'd
not want these things. Canned goods
was the cry of the day and thu cry
was ably answered by wh.desilo gro
cers, who have an enormous amouni.
of stored canned goods.
Managers of one of the lending
firms estimated yesterday that there
are more than $1,000,000 worth of
canned edibles In Tulsa, a supply
which would lust for sixty dayn.
No advances were mude on these
articles nor upon sugar or flour.
Dealers In these foods declared tr.i
they would sell at regular pr'nes un
til tholr stock was exhausted
While tho women were thus filling
the larder business men watched with
tension every development l:i lh'3
strike situation.
Early in the day it was learned that
the refiners hud abandoned their plan
to mandamus the railroads in an ef
fort to force the rnllroad.i to i urry
gasoline out of Tulsa until the lust
possible moment.
None of the railroads charged their
embargoes. The Katy shut down Its
lusincss cutiiely last night, the local
office being ordered to accept noth

of live stock nnd explosives but pro

Final Passage.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 1 Prccen
tion of Iho threatened railroad
strike through an act of congress
seemed assured tonight after the
house, by an overwhelming vote, had
passed tho Adumson eight-hour day
law und tho senate had agreed to
tako a final vote on tho measure not
later than H o'clock tomorrow eve
ning. Although it is possible that senate
amendments may make conferences
necessary, it generally is believed on
bolh sides uf the cnpltol that when
the test comes tho house bill as it
stands will be accepted and rushed
to Shadow Uiwn, N. J., for Presi-
dent Wilson's signature. And while
no formal announcements were forth
coming from the employes' brother
hoods heads tonight. It Is authorita
tively stuted that this will result In
Immediate dispatch of the code mes
sages calling off tho general strika
ordered for Monday morning.
The Adamson hill us pussed In the
houso by a vote of 230 to 66 with
minor amendments. is the same
measure which the brotherhood lead
ers officially declared yesterday
would constitute a "satisfactory set
tlement" nnd prevent the strike.
The amendments, added to conform
to a draft framed by the senate in
terstate commerce committee, would
fix the effective date January 1,
1H17, Instead of December t, 1918,
and exempt railroads less than one
hundred miles long and electrlo
street and Interurban lines. Hrlefly,
it provides:
"Thut eight hours shall he deemed
a day's work and the standard for
reckoning compesnatlon of railroad
employes operating trains In inter
state commerce after January 1.
1D17. and,
"That a commission of three ap
pointed by President Wilson shall
investigate tho effects of the. eight
hour standard from six to nine
months and then report to congress,
present wages not to be reduced dur
ing tho Investigation or for thirty
days thereafter, and overtime to be
paid at a pro-rata rato."
It was after a day of hot debate that
the house passed the bill undor a spe
cial rule brought In when Republican
ICader Mann objected to Its consid
eration. I.CBS than half of the Re
publicans followed their floor leader
In the opposition and when the final
voto cume 7ii of them lined up with
the majority, while only 66 voted
.ngnlnst the measure. Just two
liemocrnts Representatives Steele of
Pennsylvania and pluck of Texas
stood out against the bill and Repre
sentative London of New York, tho
only Socialist, voted for It.
Red tape was eliminated as far as
possible to rush the measure ovr to
the senate, which after several hours
of lively discussion over a bill report
ed by Its Interstate commerce com
mittee, had recessed until 8 o'clock.
When the senate reconvened tho
bouse legislation w.ls there awaiting
action.
The senate committee bill, drafted
during a lute session lust night and
another this morning, was the Adam
son measure with the same amend
ments adopted today by the houso
ind an added section empowering the
Interstate commerce commission to
fix the wages of interstate employes
at the end of the proposed period of
inv-stigution and thereafter.
At the outset of the night session
Senator Newlamls sought and obtained
unanimous consent to put aside the
senate bill and take un the
over from the house, thereby paving
the way for iii!ek final uction with
out parliamentary formalities that
otherwise would ho necessary. Then
Senator Cndei wood brought up the
Issue over which the senate is di
vided, by proposing us an amendment
tho rate fixing proposition of tho dis
curded senate bill. '
over this amendment debate waged"
for three hours Senators Newlamls and
I'nderwood advocating It and Senator
Cummins making a long speech eriti- ;
cising the whole proceedings. Most
of the senators had little to sav and
in the cloakrooms there were strong
Intlmutlons that the reason for this
was tho general conviction that in
the end the house bill would go
through without change. For a while
hero was talk of an all-night session,
but early In the evening word was
passed that an agreement to adjourn
and vote at a certain hour tomorrow
would come befure the discussion hail I
gono very far. )
All throughout tho morning Presi- '
dent Wilson was at his office in the
capital conferring with administration
leaders and aiding In arrangements
for putting the legislation through. Ho ,
left Washington at 3 o'clock in the ,
afternoon for Long Itisnch, V. J.,
where he will be notified formally to
morrow of his nomination for re
election, entirely confident teat his
efforts had averted the industrial
catast rophe.
