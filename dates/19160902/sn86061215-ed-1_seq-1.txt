IN THE
Both Wings of Congress Are
Rushing Legislation to
Avert Big Tie-up
MAIN DEMANDS OF
MEN ARE GRANTED
Employers Hint at IntentioK
to Test Constitutionality
of the Adamson Bill
Chicago, Sept. 1.—Counsel for
the various railroads are said to
have informed the presidents of
the roads that the Adamson bill Is
patently unconstitutional as being
confiscatory and class legislation.
E. P^Ripley, president of the
Atchison, Topeka A Santa Fe, said
today that passage of the bill
would merely postpone the strike.
"It is llloflical to assume," said
Ripley, "that the railroads
abandon their principles
merely beoause they are attacked
through congress instead of di
rectly by the brotherhoods."
Mr
will
A statement was Issued at pub
licity headquarters of the rail
roads that preparations for a
strlke next Monday were proceed
ing without regard to prospects of
congressional action.
D. C., Sept. 1.
—Bills
tatnwa
to
ftvert the railway strike
rat on their way to passage today in
loth houses of congress.
•Under a special rule providing for a
•vote not later than 4:30 this
aftern°?"
the house took up the
hour bill approved by President Wil
son and accepted by brotherhood lead
ers as a "satisfactory settlement.
The senate Interstate commerce
committee reported a similar M".
which, however, cpntalns an Important
provision empowering the Interstate
commerce commission to fix schedules
of wages on interstate railways. I
provides that the eight hour day shall
become effective January 1, 1917, that
the present pay for the ten hour day
shall apply to the shorter day, that
overtime shall be paid pro rata, but
adds that within not less than six and
not more than twelve months after its
passage the interstate commerce com
mission shall assume Jurisdiction of
the question of hours and wageis and
that they shall be subject to petition
for change from either the employers,
the employes and the public.
The possibility for a hitch seemed to
be in this added provision which is
being studied by the brotherhood lead
era.
TAKING NO CHANCES.
The committee eliminated the pro
posal that on the report of the eight
hour day commission the interstate
commerce commission "shall consider
an increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures by the
railroads affected as may have been
Tendered necessary by the adoption of
the eight hour day."
Neither of the two pending bills con
tains the Canadian commission plan,
which the labor leaders oppose, and
neither contains the government oper
ation provision. President Wilson is
willing to let those features wait until
after enough legislation to avert the
strike has been enacted.
Senate republicans decided today to
frame a bill of their own and offer it
as a substitute for the administration
plan. A committee was appointed to
draft. No serious opposition to the ad
ministration plan was expected, how
ever.
President Wilson told cabinet mem
bers at today's meeting there was
every prospect that the legislation
would be passed by both houses of
congress before tomorrow night.
8ENATE LOSES LITTLE TIME.
At 2 o'clock Senator Newlands in
troduced the revised senate bill and
it was formally referred to the inter
state commerce committee. Senator
Newlands said that the committee
would report finally within a short
time and that he would seek to hold
the senate in session until the whole
subject was disposed of, even if it
should extend the session far into the
night.
Senator Newlands made a favorable
report from the committee at 2:3b
o'clock and unanimous consent was
granted by the senate for Immediate
consideration. Senator Newlands

Conspiracy Alleged.
A conspiracy to raise foor prfees be

sent to the federal authorities here

missioner of the municipal department
of weights and measures. One hundred

Constantine Reported to Be
in Flight After Failing
to Restrain Nation
VENIZELOS PARTY
IS LEFT IN POWER
London, Sept. 1. —King Constantine
of Greece has abdicated, according to
the British official press representative
at Salonikl.
The press representative sajrs the
king has abdicated In favor of the
crown prince with Veniselos as the
power behind the throne. Hie new
policy, he reports, will be to work with
the entente allies.
According to this information, Pre
mier Zaimis will remain at the head
of the government.
The correspondent questions wheth
er the entente allies desire the active
assistance of Greece.
Ward Price to whom the foregoing
dispatch is credited, Is the official Brit
ish press representative, designated by
the government to act for al] British
publications in that area. Nevertheless
his dispatches are subject not only to
the Greek censorship but to the French
military censorship^ which controls
all lines of communication from
Athens. The fact that both censor
ships, as well as the British censor
ship in London, have permitted this
dispatch to come through is signifi
cant.
On Tuesday Mr. Price sent from Sal
onikl a report that King Constantine
had fled from Athens to Larissa. This
dispatch was discredited in London of
ficial circles. Doubt also appeared to
be cast on its correctness by dis
patches filed from Athens Wednesday,
one of them telling of coming meet
ings between the kljig and the entente
ministers and others having to do with
the illness of the king, who recently
underwent a slight operation. It la
possible, however, that the king may
have departed secretly from Athens,
as reported by Mr. Price and that his
absence was concealed from the news*
paper correspondents there.
Revolution Begins
Lohdon, Sept. 1.—The beginning of
a revolution in Macedonia is reported
in a Reuter dispatch filed yesterday
at Salonikl.
Fighting occurred In Saloniki, the
correspondent adds, but serious trou
ble was prevented by the intervention
of soldiers of the entente allies.
"The revolution claimed its first
victims this morning," the correspon
dent cables. "Cretan gendarmeB and
Macedonian volunteers surrounded
the barracks of the Greek infantry In
Salonikl and exchanged shots with
the garrison. But for the interven
tion of the allies the consequences
might have been more serious.
"After half promising to participate
In a demonstration arranged yesterday
by a pro-ally committee, the Greek
troops finally refused. During the
night pro-ally volunteers made a de
termined attempt to seize the barracks
but failed. It Is asserted one gen
darme was killed and that two were
wounded. The losses of the loyalists
have not been ascertained."
King Is Fleeing.
An Athens dispatch received yester
day predicted that Greece would aban
don neutrality within the immediate
future. It has also been reported that
King Constantine was finding his posi
tion very difficult on account of the
growing strength of the pro-entente
faction and It was reported from Sa
lonikl In a dispatch filed on Tuesday
that the king had taken flight to Lar
issa, where he was under the protec
tion of German soldiers.
There is in existence In Greece a
committee representing the liberal or
Venizelos faction and It Is possible
that the Greek garrisons surrendered
to this or some similar body. The
committee was appointed on Sunday,
on the occasion of the demonstration
of 50.000 GreekB before the residence!
of M. Venizelos in Athens, and was
instructed to present to the king res
olutions warning hiijv. not to interfere
In the approaching elections and to
prepare the army for a possible rup
ture of existing conditions.
The part of Greek Macedonia in
which the forts mentioned are located
is in northern Greece close behind the
front on which the entente allies are
fighting the Bulgarians and their allies.
Vodena is on the railroad line between
Salonki and Mon&stir, an important
means of communication for the en
tente allies. It Is forty-five miles weBt
of Saloniki. Ft. Little Karaburun is
on the Gulf of Salonikl, about ten
miles south of the city.

LAYMEN BEGIN
OTTUMWA COURIER, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1916 NUMBER It
Methodist Conference Has
Laiety in Session That
Lasts for Two Days
BANQUET WILL BE
FEATURE TONIGHT
Mt. Pleasant, Sept. 1.—(Special):
The Laymen's association of the M.
E. conference opened its annual ses
sion in the Iowa Wesleyan college
chapel this morning with the presi
dent, A. N. Jarvis of Burlington, pre
siding. Over 160 lay delegates are
here for the meeting which will con
tinue through Saturday.
All interest is now centering around
the Iowa Wesleyan banquet and edu
cational anniversary, which occurs
this evening. This is always one of
the big events of the conference. Cov
ers will be laid for three hundred
guests. President E. A. Schell will
preside, while Dr. A. W. Harris, sec
retary of the board of education and
former president of Northwestern uni
versity, will make the address of the
evening.
Following the devotional services of
Wednesday the regular business ses
sion of the Iowa conference was re-1
sumed Thursday at 8 a. m. The
services Wednesday fere of a most
impressive character and attracted a
large audience of visitors and friends.
Rev. M. D. Cox of Agency presided
while the Rev. C. A. Field of Ottumwa
led in prayer. The address of the
evening was delivered by Dr. D. D.
Forsyth of New York, secretary of the
board of home missions and church
extension. Dr. Forsythe is one of the
best known churchmen In America.
A pleasing, powerful and forceful
speaker. His address, which was
along the grounds for home missions
dealt largely with the problems of the
rural church. He urged that the young
pastors Intending to go into the work
in a rural church should educate
themselves for that particular kind of
service. He deplored the fact that so
many pastorB were anxious to secure
city appointments. The remedy for
this lies in the betterment of rural
conditions and the increasing of pas
tors' salaries. The service was con
cluded with the singing of the Iowa
Wesleyan hymn. The first business
considered in the morning session was
the report of President E. A. Schell of
Iowa Wesleyan college. This was
largely historical of the great endow
ment campaign, congratulatory of its
success and appreciation of the sup
port of the conference, both lay and
ministerial. The necessity of imme
diately raising the fifty thousand dol
lars underwritten by the Mt.f Pleasant
Commercial club was also urged. The
reports of the four district superin
tendents were then listened to and ap
proved. The reports show that de
spite the heavy drain in both tflne and
money of the recent college endow
ment campaign that the charges in all
four districts have made marked ad
vances in all departments of the work.
Nearly all apportionments were raised
in full. Pastors' salaries were gener
ally increased and the various benevo
lence demands met. There has been
an unusually large amount of church
building and improvements, particu
larly in the Oskaloosa district. In
addition to the regular demands of the
church, the four districts subscribed in
round numbers the following amounts
to the recent Iowa Wesleyan college
campaign: Burlington district, Includ
ing Henry county, $140,000 Musca
tine district, $96,000 Oskaloosa dis
trict, $56,000 Ottumwa district, $76,
000. Following the report of Dr. C.
L. Tfennant, who concludes six years'
service as superintendent of the Bur«
Mngton district, Bishop McConneil
presented to him a purse of $50 in gold
as a testimonial of the high esteem
and love in which he was held by the
members of the conference.
Make Transfers.
The following transfers were report
ed: U. R. Kersey, from the Minnesota
to the Iowa conference A. H. Lathrop,
from the Iowa to the Columbia River
conference C. E. Pettitt, from the
