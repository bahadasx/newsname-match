NEW YORK, Sept. 2.—The League
to Enforce Peacu has just placed an
order for 1,200,000 booklets setting
forth the principles of the movement
it conducts, an order requiring a car­
load of paper, with the Wynkoop,
Hallenbeck Crawford company, a
union shop. The contract provides
that the booklets shall bear the union
label.
An interesting feature of the series
is a reprint of the notable address de­
livered by Samuel Gompers, president
of the Americr Federation of La­
bor, at the first national assemblage
of the League to Enforce Peace at
"Washington, May 26, 1916, on the in­
terests of labor in the league. The
effect of this address was to arouse to
an extraordinary degree the interest
of the working classes in the league's
program for, it will be remembered
that the league proposes to prevent as
many future wars as possible, and it
is also to be borne in mind that the
majority of those wha are killed and
I of those who lose their property In
^wars are drawn from the working
classes.
International Peace Alliance.
For the benefit of those who are
not yet fully informed about the
League to Enforce Peace and what it
stands for it may be well to say that
it was organized to bring about an in­
ternational alliance thai -will have
the power to prevent some wars. It
concedes that no human agency can
prevent all wars, any more than a
police force, however, efficient, can
prevent all crimes.
The league does not propose to try
to stop the present war. The league
was organized in Philadelphia, June
17, 1915, with W. H. Taft, former
President of the United States as
president and Alton B. Barker, Dem
ocratic candidate for the presidency
in 1904, as vice president. There are
also 300 honorary- vice presidents,
state chairman," national committee^
men, including the most eminent men
and women in the country.
Prominent Members.
Its membership includes senators,
representatives, as many governors
and former governors as there are
States in the Union, the mayors of
many cities, including New York, Bos­
ton, Baltimore, New Orleans the
presidents of more than two score
universities and colleges, including
Harvard, professors of political
science and, international law, and
so on.
Because it exists for a sliigle pur
Ifose the league has been able to bring
together for that single purpose men
from all politioal parties of all
shades of belief from pacifism to pre­
paredness.
This purpose is to promote a league
of nations whose combined moral,
economic and military power will
tend to preserve the peace of the
world.
It is proposed to hold international
conferences to codify and supplement
international law to establish an in­
ternational- court to try causes of
dispute between nations and a coun­
cil of conciliation to compose diffi­
culties outside the jurisdiction of the
court. It is further proposed that
the nations in the league shall boy­
cott and use their military forces
against any member that commits an
act of war against another member
without first submitting its grievance
to court or council and awaiting a
conclusion.

Every Charge Against Corpora­
tion By Striking Miners Is
Sustained.
GOVERNOR'S OWN LABOR
COMMISSIONER REPORTS
Mine Guards and Sheriff's De­
puties Blamed for Bloodshed
on Range.
By GEORGE P. WEST.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.—-Every
charge brought against the United
States Steel corporation by the strik­
ing iron miners of northern Minne­
sota is sustained in a report just
submitted to Governor Burnquist by
ihia own state labor commissioner.
Miners have been exploited by the
contract system, cheated, oppressed,
forced to give bribes to their mine
captains, arrested without warrants,
given unfair trials, and subjected to
"serious injustices' at the hands of
the mine guards and police. This is
the substance of the findings.
Mine guards employed by the com­
pany, deputized by Sheriff Meining
without investigation, and supported
by Governor Burnquist, are to blame
for all disorder. The report says:
"We are not entirely in sympathy
with the belief that vigorous measures
were necessary to maintain peace and
safety In this strike. We are entirely
satisfied that the mine guards have
exceeded .their legal rights and du­
ties and invaded the citizenship rights
of the strikers that such violence as
has occurred has been more charge­
able to the mine guards and police
than to the strikers and that the
public police departments have en­
tirely exceeded the needs of the situa­
tion, and have perpetrated serious in­
justice upon the strikers.
"Numerous cases of arrest without
warrant, and unfair trials in the
justices' courts were brought to our
attention. We will not go into these
cases in detail, as the federal men
have promised a thorough investiga­
tion, but we are seriously Impressed
that the mine guards should have been
compelled to remain on mine property
or disarm when they left it.
"Every shooting affray that has oc
cured on the range has occurred on
public property. In no case have the
so-called riots occurred on or even
near company property.
"The parades of the talners "have
been peaceful, the public police have
had no trouble in maintaining order,
and if the private mine guards had
been compelled to remain on the
company property we do not believe
that there would ever have been any
bloodshed on the range."
Governor Burnquist,. whose tele­
gram to Sheriff Meining was generally
accepted, as an order to go the limit
in breaking the strike, is now on the
defensive. In the face of reports
from the committee on industrial re­
lations and from his oyn state labor
department, he can no longer escape
a reckoning for the part he has played
in aiding the steel corporation to
maintain industrial tyranny. After
reading the report of his own state la­
bor department he issued a statement
saying:
"As an official I am interested only
in the enforcement of the law. Per­
sonally I have had four men up there
to investigate conditions and none of
the four has ever reported to me any
undue violence on the part of of­
ficials."
Apparently Burnquist's Investi­
gators were carefully selected.

Southern Pacific Employes Must
Be Subservient to Get Old
Age Award.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31.—The
Southern' Pacific railroad warned em­
ployes that if they joined the threats
ened strike for an eight-hour day they
will forfeit their pension rights, and
Editor Barry of the Star says:
"That was to have been expected.
Every corporation that introduces an
'old adage pension' scheme does so
with the reservation, clearly ex­
pressed, that it may withdraw its pro­
visions wfhenever it sees fft to do so.
In other words, the employe never ac­
quires a 'vested right* to be cared for
in his old age. It all depends upon
his subservience and willingness to
submit to the rules laid 4own byhia
superiors for his guidance.
"That is the difference between a
real pension," such as the Typographi­
cal union, for instance, provides for
its feged members, and the 'tin-can'
kind which has a nice strong string
tied to it and can be disconnected
without consulting the wishes of the
supposed beneficiary. One may work
for -20 or 25 years with the tempting
bait of provision for his declining
years dangling before his eyes, only to
discover that on account of some in­
fraction of rules or a desire to im­
prove his condition by acting with, his
fellow employes, he is cut off from
the promised benefits of long and
faithful service.
"No doubt the.service pension is a
good thing in its way, but its real ob­
ject is to enforce obedience and. sub­
servience by threat of its withdrawal.
It is not a safe dependence for red
blooded Americans."

MINISTERS FAVOR
STRIKING OOOKS
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31.—Sev­
eral clergymen have pledged their
supprort to striking culinary workers
who are attempting to reduce hours.
Rev. W. A. Squires of Lebanon Pres­
byterian church wrote:
"I believe in the principles of the
closed (union) shop. I believe that
the unions have greatly improved con­
ditions of the workers, and "that no
man has a moral right to share in
that benefit and at the same time
pursue a selfish course which will
work against unionism. I believe that
every workingman Owes a debt to the
unions, and that he can pay that debt
only by helping to' rfiake them strong.
"I assure you that not a few in
the church feel as I do and we wish
you Godspeed. Yours is not a wholly
selfish goal. You are fighting for
something more than a portion of
material things. Every just cause is
a cause humanity wide."

Episcopal clergymen the following
resolution was adopted:
"We are in hearty sympathy

The nationalistic, traditionalist educa­
tion of Europe fosters exclusiveness,
diffidence, hatred. Hence the strange
paradox that the best educated of all
European nations is also the most
bigoted in its pride and selfishness
that the hateful prejudices which
have caused the present war have
been kept up, not by the common
people, but by poets, politicians and
university profesors. All of us, when
we come to America, are welcome to
preserve our sentimental and artistic
traditions but we are expected ,to
leave behind all the hereditary jeal­
ousies which are the warp and woof
of European history. What Europe
needs is a similar experience, a great
unlearning, a. mighty revolution
against the dead hand of the past
that still oppresses her. The past is
past! Let us cherish the fine old
stories of our fathers' heroic deeds.
But let us settle all present and fu­
ture differences as men of the twen­
tieth century. If we could but con­
jure away that incubus of historical
traditions, peace would be at hand.

Thug Methods Used By Factory
Owners To Cheat Women
Employes.
DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 2.—-The
strike of 7,000 "women, girls *tnd a
comparatively few men, is still on,
despite thug methods of police,, silence
on the part of daily newspapers and
blindness of uplifters, welfare work­
ers and other prominent citizens
whose mission in life Is to help the
workers.
One of the leading spirits among
the strikers is Anna Swiezkowaks, who
tells this story of how Detroit's large
cigar industry is. handled:
"The labor laws of Michigan pro­
vide that no wonman shall work more
than 54 hours a week, but we girls
work from 10 to 11 hours a day and
are always being speeded up. We
often have but 10 minutes to eat our
lunch and many girls eat it while
working, not even stopping to wash
their .hands. There are lots of little
girls not more than 13 or 12 among
us, and I have seen the forewoman
slap and cuff them about and take all
their cigars away from them, saying
that they are no good. These cigars
are sojd, but the children don't get
any pay for them. The girls have 25
or 50 cigars taken away from them at
a time because they are told that they
are not up to the standard, but they
are sold as firsts just the same. This
is so the girls will not get as much
money/ Every 100 cigars we make,
we have to make one free for the
company. That makes 12,000,000 in
a year.
"Besides this we are expected to
get so many cigars out of so much to­
bacco, and if can't do this we are
docked. Sometimes the tobacco is
good and sometimes it is so bad that
we can get but 75 where we are ex­
pected to get 100. There is no one
that we can go to with our troubles.
We have Just to stand any injustice
that is given to us. Last week I was

but a policeman said I had thrown a

they had been drinking. Lots of our

WILSON BACKS PLAN
Governments Attiture Marks
Most Dramatic Labor Epi­
sode In History.
By DANTE BARTON.
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.—The most
dramatic incident in the annMg of
labor unionism in America was when
the chiefs of the four railroad brother­
hoods and 646 other executives of the
railway employes of the whole United
States met with the President of the
United States for the settlement of
•the demand for the eight-hour day.
The climax, to that incident came
when the President of the United
States announced the principle for
which trade unionism has fought—
that the eight-hour day is not a sub­
ject of arbitration that the eight
hour'day is fundamentally right and
a necessary part of the economic and
industrial law of the United States.
The President pronounced "the law
higher than the Constitution" when he
thus declared the extra-legal judg­
ment of the whole people of the
United States.
The solidarity of the labor move­
ment was illustrated in this great
fight of the railway workers for the
eight-hour day as it never has been
before. Back of the absolutely united
demands of the railway operatives
were the solid ranks of the millions
of other organized workers of the
United States, represented by the head
of the American Federation of La­
bor, Samuel Gompers.
Striking Contrast.
That great exhibition of the power
of organized labor standing solidly
together was equalled by the exhibi­
tion of weakness of the men who nom­
inally control the railways as "own­
ers.' First the managers who were
called before the President, and then
the presidents of the railroads who
appeared before the public's, chief, ex­
ecutive, proved their utter dependence
upon the few financiers who have
no interest in "the railroad business
except to make profits but of it *nd
to manipulate stocks and bonds.
Another-, result «f treoandotti
-nificanoa waa .to-prove what asham
and what a hypocritical thing "ar­
bitration" is, as the railway owners
use that phrase. At the same tinie
that they were demanding arbitration
of the eight-hour principle, their
chief spokesman were saying that the
eight-hour principle could not work
and would ruin any road thatjnstalled
it —this in face of the fact that many
roads have installed it without ruin,
and in face of the fact that many of
the roads that have not installed it
ihave been wrecked by financial mis­
deeds. But where these railway man­
agers and presidents gave their hand
away was the proof they gave that
they had nothing to fear from arbitra­
tion—that if they got their usual ar­
bitration" they felt absolutely assured
that they would not have to put in
an eight-Qiour day.
The attitude of these men who
nominally control the vital transpor­
tation business of the United States, is
that they are the "strikers," striking
not for principle, striking not for the
the betterment of the railway busi­
ness or for those engaged in the rail­
way industry, but striking for the per­
sonal interests opposed to public wel­
fare and to the Industrial justice due
the men who run the trains.
Hypocrisy of Owners.
The use of coercive power to get
unorganized and underpaid railway
workers to protest against the rightful
demands of the organised railway
workers was another spectacle that

tion the essential right and necessity

that America desires Is to he a leader
In the cause of international as well
as national justice. And the supreme
achievement-' of American patriotism,
the American conquest of the world,
will be the day when the jealous pa­
triotism of European countries has
died, when all nations are united In
the bonds of democracy and peace,
under the aegis of justice.
Sons of the discoverers, the con­
querors, the pilgrims and the pion­
eers! The taSk li not done. There
are more strange and lonely seas tor
your ships to plough. Never have
such infinite horlsons been revealed
to the eyes of any. generation. Go
forth, in the spirit of high* adventure
discover for yourselves and organise
for all future generations the new
America, the promised land that we.
your elder* dreamed of and shall
never see, this universal common­
wealth founded on justice and love.
