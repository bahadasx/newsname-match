Arthur Vine deal
er, neglects his ildren
while in the to rtenay,
an empty-his dancer.
Cora, the wife, sits her
sister Alice, who text door.
Alice is the wife of Fred Brown, a
detective, and has three children.
With the family lives Fred's bachelor
brother, Charles, who is a former
lover of Cora, and cannot bear to see
her neglected by her husband.
It is during one of Cora's visits to
the house, when Charles goes off and
sits by the fire alone to try and still
his heart-ache, that the children of
the house and her children come to
beg hinm for a "good-night" story.
While he is deliberating, one of the'
children asks why he has no wife
and children of his own; and in this
he finds his inspiration. Unknown to
him, Cora is listening behind the cur
tnint
He tells them the story of how he
once lived in the enchanted forest of
dreams, loving a beautiful fairy called
Sweetheart, and how she, in answer
to his prayers to True Love, queen of
all the fairies, was made a mortal and
hit by Cupid's dart to make her heart
tender toward him. They were very
happy, continued Charles, until Sel
fish, son of the Ogre who lived in the
forest, desired her. Selfish sent two
llwafu, Lies and Jealousy, to cast a
,elfish. When Charles saw this he
fell down dead; but the fairies
brought him back to life by replacing
his heart with a cold stone.
Later, Corn and Charles are thrown
together, and she admits her heart
has been made a cold stone too. The
old love blazes up fiercely. In the
meantime, Arthur is in danger of
losing his cabaret girl because his
money is giving out. So he plans to
rob the bank. His plan is ingenious;
and when the bank is robbed suspicion
is cast upon Charles, the cashier.
Charles is unable to declare his alibi,
that he was with Cora, for fear of
bringing scandal upon her and her
children.
But the children at play have
found the hiding-place of the real
thieves, and the police fight that fol
lows brings happiness to Charles, to
C'ora, and to the children of the
house.
"The Social Highwayman."

the Gem Theatre next Monday, is

Jaffray escapes the authorities. In
the meantime the demented Ilanby

words that he committed the mystify

everything to the girl he loves, and
how he sets about rebuilding his life,

consistently excellent photoplay.
"The Closed Road."
"The Closed Road," a World pro
duction with I-louse Peters and Bar

Will he the attraction at the Gem,
e oesdayd
Rugs ' Anneraley, a young doctor
who has discovered a cancer cure, is
accused of murdering a former client
to w'homn he had written a letter ask
ng that a bill for his services be paid
at once. Julia, D)r. Annersley's sister,
sets about to prove his innocence.
While visiting 'Dr. Appledan, her
brother's old friend, he casually tells
I her that the patient just leaving his F
ollice, Fi-ank Sargeant, has been told
lie had but a few months to live, and
will undoubtedly commit suicide.
Julia follows Sargeant, reaching his
side as he is about to pull the trigger
of his revolver, set against his temple
Persuading him to listen to her, sh
explains her brother's plight, and
points out to him that instead of
wasting his life by committing suicide,
lie might assume the blame for the
crime of which her brother is accused
and thus, by clearing Annersley of
the charge and allowing him to con
tinue his research work, be the means
of saving millions of lives and there
by do some good to humanity.
Feeling that lie has but a fe'
months to live, Sargeant accepts
Julia's proposition, and so adroitly
fabricates circumstantial evidence
against himself that he is arrested
and convicted of the crime. A few
days before the time set for his
electrocution, old Dr. Appledan is
found to be insane. During one of
his lucid moments he confesses that
he murdered Griswold by giving him
an overdose of medicine, and to
clear himself of suspicion, placed
Annersley's pistol near the body.
Julia succeeds in finding Sargeant's
former butler, who testifies that Sar
geant was at home at the time the
crime was committed. 'These facts
establish Sargeant's innocence so
completely that he is released. Pre
viously, upon learning of Dr. Apple
dan's insanity, he had asked that his
heart be examined, and the organ
was found to be absolutely sound.
How Julia repays Sargeant for his
great sacrifice by her love and devo
tion brings the picture to a happy
ending.
Alice Brady in "La Bohemne."
Alice Brady, the charming and tal
rnted emotional star, will be seen at
the Gem Wednesday as "Mimi" in a
pieturization of Henri Murger's cele
brated book, "La Vie de Boherne."
Mimi, a foundling, is taken from
the convent in which she has been
raised, to an inn kept by M. Ducros.
There Rudolphe, nephew of the
wealthy M. Durandin, falls in love
iu ftri'fak ie` e ci t
wealthy widow and friend of his un
cle. Rudolphe has a quarrel with his
uncle, aid leaves him. In the Latin
Quarter in Paris he meets several
Bohenians, who are in the country
for a' holiday, and in their mode of
living he sees his ideal life.
And then, a few minutes later, he
rescues Mimi from the unwelcome at
tentions of a guest in the inn, and in
her he finds his ideal woman, but Mar
eel, a painter of some renown, comes
between them. Musette, sweetheart
of Mai'cel, introduces Mimi to an
other rich young man, but she re
mains loyal to Rudolphe, although he
is lead to believe otherwise, with the
result that Rudolphe, in a rage, leaves
Mimi. From this point they drift to
vastly different channels, until one
day, Mimi, exhausted, finds herself in
front of the home of Madame de
Rlouvre, who tells her to go away, that
Rudolphe has given her up.
Later Mimi makes her way to the
old home where she had been so
happy with Rudolphe. Here she is
found by Musette, who brings the
four men to see her. Combined, they
have not sufficient money to buy her
the necessary medicine, so each de
termines to raise the money himself.
They also try to please Mimi with a
muff for which she has always yearn
ed, to keep her hands warm.
Rudolphe goes to his uncle; Mar
cel takes his painting to a pawnbrok
er, where he meets Schaunard, who
parts with his horn and favorite pipe,
while Collins pawns his few beloved
books. They raise enough money to
buy the muff, and return to the room,
to find Rudolphe and his uncle, and
Madame de Rouvre, who have repent
ed and are sorry for their selfishness.
Mimi passes away in the midst of her
loyal friends, with the realization that
Rudolphe has always loved her; and
that her dearest friends gave their
little to make her happy at the end.
Bessie Barriscale in "Not My Sister."
Should a wife happily married con
fess to her husband a misstep made in
her youth? Should she risk her hap
piness in this way?
The heroine in "Not My Sister" is
confronted by a problem even harder
than this, for the same man who
wronged her wanted her sister to
pose for him. She couldn't persuade
the girl not to go, and she dared not
tell her husband of her own mistake,
so daily she went to the studio to pro
tect the y~nger" girl, until finally she
aroused the jealousy of her husband.
And then she had to tell him. lie
vowed to kill the artist, and started
for his studio. The next day the
newspaper headlines screamed the
fact of the artist's death. Hle had
been found on the floor of his studio
with a knife in his heart. The hus
band was arrested and brought to
trial, but he wasn't convicted. In
fact, nobody was.
If you like a picture that stirs
every emotion be sure to see this
splendid Triangle production at the
Gem next Saturday. Bessie Barris
cale and William Desmond play the
leading roles and are ably supported
by a company of capable players.

Coronado's famous hotel was used

-the broad verandas, massive parlor
and rotund architecture and the beau
tiful grounds surrounding the hotel
forming ideal settings for a story

Pauline Frederick in "Audrey."
1?uuli~eFr erck,.wi se c
,Donna" have indisputably placed her
in the position of the screen's fore
most emotional artiste, departs from
her customary roles in the picturiza
tion of the celebrated novel and play,
"Audrey," which will be the offering
at the Grand Monday. Audrey is a
simple, unsophisticated girl of the
woods, who has been rescued by the
Indians when a child, made the house
hold drudge of a hypocritical minister
and his wife, and is finally nearly
drowned by an angry mob that be
lieves her to be in the power of a
witch, being rescued from the fanatics
only by the devotion of young Lord
Haward, who alone understands the
spirited girl's impulses and emotions.
The friendship of Lord Haward and
Audrey develops into a tender but
stirring romance, which, together
with the varying action of this Para
mount picture, makes of it a thoro
mount picture, makes of it a thor
oughly absorbing and thrilling photo
play.
Blanche Sweet in "The Sowers."
There is a timeliness in the presen

picture art. An advance synopsis of
it here is inadvisable and would de

ing it, since much of the interest of
the development of the plot on the
screen hangs on a thread of mystery
and surprise that is spun out, with
clever producing touches, to the very
end of the story.
If it were necessary to pick one out
standing feature from the many ele
iments of greatness this production
embodies, it would unhesitatingly be
the emotional power of Beatriz Miche

Kate Wilson in this picture is her
greatest achievement since forsaking

the best looking ad; the Bank of Ba
ton Rouge, for the best written ad,
