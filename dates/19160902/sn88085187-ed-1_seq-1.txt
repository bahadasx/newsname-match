WOUNDED IN WAR

JURY FINDS
NO CLUE 10
MURDERER
Testimony at the Inquest held
by Coroner Stewart Saturday
morning in the case of T. W.
Bethel, the negro who was found
dead in the Perkins building Fri
day morning, brought out the
fact that the man whom Bethel
had struck over the head with
his cane, presumably the murder
er, had light brown hair, and
therefore could not have been a
negro.
The Jury's verdict was that
Bethel "came to his death from
gunshot wounds at the hands of
an unknown person."
Police Officer John Ellison
told the coroner he had found
Bethel's hat lying near his body.
The officer measured the dis
tance with Bethel's cane, which
was a heavy, wooden stick, and
found It to be three feet.
The other hat was lying farther
away and to one side, and was
cut as if it had been struck with
the cane. Hanging to the edges
of the cut were the hairs, which
he described as being an inch or
two in length.
O. P. Hudson, a newsboy in the
Ledger mailing room, told of hav
ing seen Bethel arguing with a
white man, and hearing him cry,
"Don't you follow me," as he'
made for the shelter of the build
ing. Cyril Wilson, another mail
ing room employe, told of chas
ing two of the four men who ran
out of the building after the shot.
and Cliff Osborne, driver of the
patrol wagon, said a newsboy told
him he saw two men run south
on A street and turn down an al
ley by Tebbetts' store.
Dr W. B. Mccreery, who was
called' to attend Bethel, testified
that one bullet went through the
nan's lungs and one through his
abdomen.

ELS OF
A BLOODY
ASSAULT
F. S. Fenwick, former Times
printer, and at present in the
trenches somewhere in France,
wrote a letter recently while on
sick leave in London to confirm
the statement that war Is indeed
all that an illustrious American
said it was.
"As a rule 'Tommy' has little
time to write and less inclina
tion," Fenwirk says in the letter
to Jack Hrowne, of the Times
mechanical force, "but I'm Just
out of the hospital and In concen
tration camp again I'll leave
for the front as soon as 1 am
stronger, which will be mighty
soon.
"It would be difficult to de
scribe the hellinh Inferno 1 was
In out there," he continues, de
scribing the attack in July in No
Man's laud when he was
wounded.
"I don't think any man can
adequately picture it in words.
He knows what it is like if he
has been through it, but it is im
possible ... (Here
the censor erased 10 lines.)
"I'm afraid it I could have
l-cali/.cd what war was like I
would never have left the
lulled States. All night long
before vvc went over the top,
the shelling on Imilli shies
had gradually been growing
in intensity until it was ini
|K>ssihle to hear one's own
voice, and I lien at 7:80, our
artillery ceased firing and
that was our signal to
crawl out of our trendies.
"As 1 crawled out the man
next to me had his head
blown off by a piece of shell.
Hln blond covered inc. 1 must
have been a horrible sight,
for the first German 1 saw
threw up his hands and yell
ed, "Merry Kumerad."
"After we captured their
trendies we could not hold
them, and were driven back.
A few of us were cornered,
and it was then I was in
jured. I wasn't wounded •
badly, but lost a lot of
blood. I lay In a shell hole
until dark and then crawled •
back to our lines.
"The man wiio threw the
bomb that wounded me—
praise be that his aim was
poor—faced his death with
out a quiver. I had just cov
ered him wheu he threw Ihe
bomb. He died without
flickering an eyelash. They
were decent and let ns re
move our wounded after the
battle was over.
"Some of the Germans are
not hiiin ii ii. They bayoneted
our wounded in the trenches.
Their officers made them do
It."
Penwlck closed with the state
ment that it might be a long time
before he would be able to write
again, if at all.

History Will
Repeat Itself
Six years ago every standiiat, boM-COB
trolled newspaper in the state, every ma
chine politician, every political crook
worked and fought and lied against Sen.
Poindexter, AND THE PEOPLE
ELECTED POINDEXTER OVER
WHELMINGLY.
Poindexter lias been brave enough not
to make peace with the political .jackals.
Therefore, he finds against him this
time the same enemies that he had six
years ago and for six years he has known
that these same enemies would be against,
him, and he was willing to keep them
against him and to have the people with
him.
Why should the state of Washington
trade a senator of Poindextei's caliber, a
man whose record is clean, a man who
never dabbled in crooked pork-barrel
frame-ups, a man who was never tamed
with mileage graft, a man who has in
fluence and respect in Washington I
There is no reason for such a calami
tous 1 lade, and the people of this state will
make no such a trade.
Poindexter is entitled to every vote
this time that he received six years ago
and his record in Washington entitles him
to thousands of new supporters. ]f Un
people could not be bunked and deceived
by the lies and slanders printed against
Poindexter six years ago they cannot be
deceived now.
Poindexter will be elected—and elected
overwhelmingly as he was before.
History will repeat itself.
HUMPHREY'S BLUFF
1 CALLED IN SEATTLE!
SEATTLE, Sept. 2. —Will E.,
Humphrey, candidate for U. S
senator, is in a bad hole over his
connection with the Seattle post
office duck pond swindle,
through which treasury depart
ment officials say the govern
ment was swindled out of nearly
11,000,(100.
He's in so bad that it looks as
if he'd never get out. Even the
support of his best friends has
dropped out from under.
Humphrey bit off more than he
could chew at his meeting In
Bremerton Wednesday night,
when he flung a challenge to The
Seattle Star.
In trying to make another de
nial of his connection with the
duck pond deal, Humphrey made
the statement that he would for
feit $1,000 to charity and with
draw from the race If it could be
proved that he ever recommend
ed the site.
Xobody Goes to Jail.
He also made the statement
that The Star never had had the
courage to charge that he directly
influenced the selection of the
frog pond site, and that if The
Star ever did make that asser
tion he would put an editor in
Jail within 24 hours!
Next day The Star called both
bluffs right off the hat. In clear
terms it repeated the charges. <
"You did try to influence the
purchase of the site," said The
Star, but maybe you haven't any
Influence, therefore you could
not use It directly or otherwise."
It Is more than 24 hours, con
siderably more, since The Star
called Humphrey's bluff. And
still nobody has gone to jail.
Accepts Challenge.
Also The Star Thursday jump
Ed at the $1,000 charity offer,
proposing as judges for the show
down former Senator Samuel H.
Piles, republican; George F. Rus
sell, republican, who was post
master when the duck pond site
was purchased and Edgar Battle,
democrat, and present Seattle
postm/'/ter.
These men were suggested be
cause all of them knew of the in
side deal by which the duck pond
was saddled onto the government.
The Star made these provisos
■—That Humphrey should first put
up his $1,000 and that the inves
tigation should be open to the
public.
Thursday night Humphrey
came out with a statement pro
posing Federal Judge rush man.
Superior Judges Ronald and Pra
ter, instead of the judges named
by The Star.
Friday The Star immediately
accepted the judges Humphrey
selected, insisting again that he
put up his $1,000.
Saturday it was Humphrey's
move, and Humphrey has
stalled. He wants The Star to
Iky Its evidence on the table. The
Star comes back with the de
mand that Humphrey live up to
his own terms.
I The Star promises its case wIU
he brief, consisting purely of
documentary evidence showing
in black and white that Hum
phrey did try to use his influ
ence for the duckpond swindle.
Also showing that Humphrey
voted for a mileage graft by
which he was to draw $1,200 of
the government's money for a
trip which he never made.
Humphrey has bitten off more
than he can chew.

School Board May Be
Asked to Recompense
For Whipping Injury
By Mabel Abbott
"My boy will have to have

whipping given him by the
principal of a Tacoma
M-holl five years ago.
"Don't you ladles think
the si In.id board should pay
for the operation?"
A quiet little woman dropped
this question like a bomb Into
the close of the meeting of the
Tacoma Mothers' Congress at
the Central school Friday.
The mothers had spent the
session, which was the first of
the school year, in informal
plans for the work of parent
teacher circles, and were ad
journing, when Mrs. Henry C.
Powers, 14 22 South 4 3rd street,
asked to be heard
"l want to ask you," she said,
"to tell me what is right to do
about my boy.
"The man, who was principal
of a Tacoma school five years
ago, whipped Arthur so the boy
was ruptured, and has had to
wear a truss ever since.
"Arthur was only 11 years old
then, and the doctors said he
ought not to have an operation
at that time; but now he will
have to have one or go through
life the way he is.
"1 took it up with the prose

nothing was done about It. The
