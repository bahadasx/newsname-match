Opelousas has a ghost story all
its own. All these stories New Or
leans and Shreveport newspapers
have been publishing about the
real hair-breath stories are naught
$-, compored to the sure enough story
told about the nightly visitor at the
7?'St. Landry Cotton Oil Company.
For the past week brick bats
have been flying all around the
buildings of the; oil company; there
is not a window pane left to pro
teot the inside walls .from thq
weather.
Manager Laurent Stagg, of the
s St. Landry Cotton Oil Mill, realiz
-ing that the ghost was more realis
Stic than anything, quickly appealed
to the city authorities for- help in
tracing down the ghost. For. the
past several nights police officers
and several civilians *fave been
.keeping nightly watch at the oil
inill. Everytime one moves, with
a lantern, brick bats and pebbles
begin to pour from every direc
tion. '
Every' possible attempt at trac

as been made, with no avail. It
oatters not where the light is,
whether n a room, outside or
whether it is up on- top of the

REV. DROK GONSENTS TO
SWORDS BOYS DEMAND
Minister Friend of the Late Sheriff
Gives out Public Statement
Relative to Letter
Rev. J. B. Brock, an intimate and
close friend of the late lamented
Sheriff Marion L. Swords, who was
chosen by the countless friends of
the murdered sheriff, to receive
contributions from the public to a
fund to lift the mortgage ,off the
home of Mrs. Swords, yields to the
demand of the Swords boys, as ea
pressed in a letter, appearing in
the Clarion, last Saturday.
Mr. Brock was actuated, like the
other Swords friends, to help lift
the mortgage off the beautiful.
home of the dead sheriff, because
Sheriff Swords had pauperized
himself, on account of his desire
and fondness to assist all those in
need of monetary assistance.
Following is the statement made
by the well known Opelousas min
ister:
"Relative to the nice letter writ
ten by the Stwords boys published.
in last week's issue of the Clarion
declining to let the public pay off
the mnortgage: now resting on the
Swords home, I desire to say that
I am very sorry that any misun
derstanding has arisen for we who
initiated the movement were as
sured that it wohld be satisfactory
to the family, otherwise we never
'would have begun.
"In regard to the sentiments ex
pressed in said letter, I desire to
say that ordinarily they are cor
rect, but Mr. Swords was a public'
man and spent a great portion of
his official income each year in
paying surety debts and giving
to charity, and now if those whom
h~e has helped, together with his
many friends, desire to pay this
mortgage, I cannot see how .it
could. in the least reflect on the
lfamily.
"But in view of the said letter, I
will sCa that it isa-impossible now
for the movement to succeed and I
therefore decline to have anything
more 'to do with it, and I now re
quest the public to send no further
contributions to me, and the many
cheeks, whi I cha ab&leady re
ceived will be relt c4 by me." -

OITY WATER AND ICE
PRONOUNCED HEALTHY
State Board of Health Analyzes
Opelousas Water apd lee As
Good for Human Consumption
Dr. Oscar Dowling, president of
the Louisiana State Board of
Health, notified Mayor Edward L.
hLoeb, that he had analyzed the Ope
lousas water and ice and had dis
covered that both were very
good for human consumption.
This is one city in Louisiana
whose'water and ice has always
been considered exceedingly
healthy; the city' administration has
always striven to keep it as free
from contamination as possible and
much credit is due the officials of
this city.
It will be remembered when an
epidemic of typhoid fever broke
out in this city last year some peo
ple thought it was because of the
impurity of the city water. Dr. B.
A. Littell immediately had the
water analyzed and it was soon as
certained that Opelousas water was
as healthful as any other water in
the state. It is gratifying to note
that the same standard is being
kept and that there is absolutely
no danger of disease in 'he city
water, as advised by the highest
health authority in the state.
