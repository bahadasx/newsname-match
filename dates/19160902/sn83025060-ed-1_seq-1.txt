MH. HUQI-SES ANSWERS.
Thoso Who Clamored for His VIewaj
Are Hearing Them.
Thoso friends of Democracy who
clnmoretf so loudly for Mr. Hughes'
opinions upon current lssueu whllo
ho still IipU tho high olllco of justice
of tho uuprcnio court, are now fully
answered by the private citir.cn, who
Hiirrcnderod his judicial position to
nccedu to tho wishes of a majority oC
the people ns expressed through their)
Instruct'ouH to their delegates to tliej
ltepublican national convention.
Mr. IIu;;h a has not dlnppo;ntod;
thoao who have repoird confidence lii
his ehanreter and Judgment. In liN
Hjieceh of acceptance he has "learly
set forth tho vital Ihhuus upon which
tlio ltepuhlichn party proposes to
conduct tho campaign thli fall. On
tho platform ho is telling tho nation
wherein tho present administration)
has been nt fault and what Is neces
sary to be done to restore the United
'.States to the place of respect and
honor to which It is entitled in tho
eyes of tho world.
WR. HUGHES HAS EXPLODED THE
"KuPT-US-OUT-OF-WAR"
ARGUMENT.
Mr. Hughes' attnek upon tho "kept-iis-out-of-war"
nrgument has aroused
u story of cnthut-lnsm.
"Kept us out of war?" ho demands.
"Why, there were nineteen men good
American soldiers, shot down at Vera
Cruz, and many Mexicans wero kilted
by our men. Thnt was war. More
over, it was a very Ignoble war. I
have heard three explanations of the
.Vera Cruz move.
"First, It was explained that It was
made In order to compel somebody
to saluto the ling somebody who hnd
Insulted us. Hut tho ilag was not sa
luted and has not been to this day.
Then It was said that the siluto was
not what we sought, but to prevent
the landing of a boatload of ammuni
tion Intended for Huerta. The ammu
nition, landed, however, and it has
lieen shown that It reached Iluerta
In duo ucason without Interference on
our part.
i "When ill' t jonson wnn shown U
lie untenable, L third one nnd possibly
the real one llnnlly was advanced,.
It was said that our seizure of Vera
Cruz was n movo to compel tho retire
ment of Iluerta. It seems possible
that this Is true, although we had
promised tho Mexicans that wo would
not Interfere In their affairs and told
them more than once that wo wanted
Ihem to handle their own affairs.
"That Is why the Mexlchna could
not understand us and that Is why
they show little faith In our promises."
MANANA
Mnnnnn, which Is Mexican for
"watchful waiting," Is tho Democratic
keynote In tho campaign. The Wilson
drive Is to begin "sometime" nftcr
September 1; but no definite engage
.monts have been made, It Is an
"iiminccd, for him to commence making
political speeches. Ho has tentative
engagements to make some Western
visits about the middle of September
but nothing positive. Plans are be
ing formulated for carrying on a cam
paign to capturo tho woman vote of
the country, but who will make tho
Kpceehcs on this phase of the con
troversy has not been determined. It
hnd been expected thnt Mr. liryan
would speak In the Maine campaign,
but It is now believed ho cannot do
so, but will mako somo speeches later.
And so It goes. Watchful waiting
will prevail while, In tho n.eantlme
Mr. Hughes is carrying on a posltlvo
campaign nnd arousing tho eutiro
Western country.
WILSON'S POJ-ICIES DLOWN UP.
Charles Evans Hushes did hnvo ex
plosives with him when his motor car
wns searched by a Canadian soiti er,
but they were ""te"1
hat. Mr. Hughes will sot them off
on his Western tour ) and some o Mr.
Wilson's policies will bo blown up.

j ter. In
Need of Constructive Legislation.
Just before the European war broke
out we had a million skilled mechnn-'
tes out of work and nearly half a mil-"
Hon railroad men wero Idle, together
with nearly half a million freight cars.
The railroads wero suffering from
lack of freight to carry to market, and
Industry was gradually becoming
stagnant. In Louisiana two hundred
thousand acres of sugar land were
plowed tip becauso of Democratic
changes In the tariff law. It Is gen
erally conceded by all save the blind
that the rountry wns not progressing.
Attempts were made to keep courage
up by the predictions mnde by Secru
tnrles McAdoo and Ilcdflcld and I'resl
"dent WINon of the great tnide bootni
which were soon to appear but which
failed to materialize until the outbreak
of war on the continent.
EDITORIAL PARAGRAPHS.
Two futile invasions of Mexico nnd
six separate and distinct policies on
tho question of permitting urm3 nnd
ammunition to'bc sent into that coun
try are Included In tho performance of
tho Wilson administration In Its deal
ings with our southern neighbors In
leJs than three years. It Is this char
acteristic Instability of tho govern
ment thnt makes pcoplo want u
clmtigc. Ulil..ji!
When Clmrles E. Hughes said: "Tho
dealings of the ndmluhitratlon with
Mexico constitute a confused chapter
of blunders," he gave un explicit char
acterization of the Wilson administra
tion's policy In ono sentence.
Just ns It Is now obstinately shut
ting its eyes to tho need of Indus
tilal preparedness, for three years the.
Wilson administration refused to see
the need of udequato military pre
paredness. With war on o'ur southern
border it was content to rely on a
regular army that could only muster
10,000 available men and rcfuod to
continue tlio established policy of
building up our navy. When the time
came for action, tho country had not
suillclent troops to pollco tho border
and this force has been supplemented
by n trlile more than one third tho
wnr Gtrength of tho national guard. If
tho national administration had Had
tho ability to Interpret tho signs of
tho time military preparedness would
have been well under way instead of
barely begun.
Charles B. nughes, tho Republican
candidate, recognizes an Important
fact that Woodrow Wilson, tho Demo
cratic president, nppears to have
overlooked that tho United States is

ledger, Says Capper's Paper
It's a Daily Occurrence In
Kansas Police Court
A real saloon, with a bartender and
jlass bus boon discovered by tho To
ooka (Kns.) police. Tlio Topeka Cap!
al, Governor Copper's paper recited
ho story ot tho disco very:
What promtccd to bo ono of the
.nost intoro&ting pollco court liquor
.rials In several years wan postponed
wcontly. A. W. Vogol, proprietor ot
ho Vogel cloantng establishment at
.ho northeast corner of Tenth nnd
.Causaa avonuo, and James Richard
son, employed there, wero scheduled
.or trial for running a Joint. Tho nt
tei.ed joint Ii in tho building onncd
jy (lOttllob N'ollor, arrested on a
.Iquor warrant tho day before tho
Vogel place was raided.
Thcro Is nothing of npocial Intercut
In trying a person In pollco court for
soiling liquor. Scarcely a session ot
police court goes by without such n
trial. Tho lntorost In Vogol centers
In tho fact that ho conducted a place
where liquor could bo purchasod, not
by tho bottlo, but by tho drink, ac
cording to Ilarvoy Parsons, chiof of
police.
Liquor Sold By the Drink.
"Dotectlvo Thomas Morgan and my
self, whon wo went to tho placo, found
a very nice layout whnro a customer
could ntop up, lay down hla money,
pour a drink of whisky from n bottlo
to a glass of regulation saloon size
and toss It down," said Parsons.
"Wo found a copper water cooler.
Near It sat a whisky glass and Inside
tho wntor coolor was a bottle of
whisky. A young fellow, supposedly
waiting to havo a pair of trousers
pressed, sat with a half-ompty bottlf
of boor boforo him when wo entered.'
Whon tho ofneors entered tho place
Vogol retreated out tho back door. Hi
had noarly roached tho comer of the
building, with ovory Indication of pre
paring to take to bib hcol3, whon Uhlol
Parsons commanded him to halt. The
chief thinks that other porsons pre
ceded Vogol. Clothes hanging In the
room were Happing as though thoj'
had been stirred by a breozo. No
wind was blowing, and tho chiof
thinks tho stir was caused by a rapid
exit of patrons.
Wrapped Up For Auto Trade.
Almost a full case of whisky in half-
pint bottles was found In tho place,
and a full case was found In Vogol's
residence on Douthltt nvonuo. The
bottlos, howovor, wero not wrapped
In tho cuBtonmry way to bo shipped
by oxpreia. They wore bound 1 bur
lap In a mannor convtjuteut for carry
ing In an automobile.
Richardson, It 1b chargod by tho po
llco, acted as bartender for Vogel
Tho trial was postponed yestorday be
causo tho city wtehod tlmo lp which
to produce more- ovldenco.
"I think we hlicild Hot aside n day
for the trial of Nol'cr, Vogol and Rich,

Paul Heinz, assistant city attorney, to

The Democrats are llndlng out that

The men nnd women who prefer n
man who does thlnm to u man who
wrltesuotes about tlicm will vote
for Hughes. Government by corrc-
spondence takes too long to get any
where, but government by dcedd is
ulwuys on the Job.
Those who are concerned to know
what .Mr. Hughes would have done
had he been In Mr. Wilson's plnce
may rest assured he would not have

Is uuswer enough.
Mr. Hughes Is not only going direct
