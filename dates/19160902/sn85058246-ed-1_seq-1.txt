TAXPAYER WANTS I
PUBLICITY SO I
ALL MAY KNOW I
Doar Editor: ; V9
I road with much Interest tho state-
ment printed in your valuable papor ' M
given out by tho city commission In VS
tho mattor of why they feel that tho M
city should bo bonded for water and ' Vfl
light. Wo aro indeed sorry that they M
did not glvo us the information wo M
so much needed In ordor to Intclll-
gontly vote on this proposition. flBfl
Wo recall that more than 25 years Ba
ago wo wore asked to voto for bonds IBS
for city water. It was provided nn ftV
tho bonds that after 10 years an as- H
sossment should bo levied each Bfl
year to llquldato tho said bonds but M
when the ten years rolled around the Ba
city council refused to comply with
the agreement and the result was BJ
that nt the end ot 20 years thoy wero BJ
obliged to renew tho bonds for an- M
other 20 years. They had In tho 20 M
years paid as much as tho principal BJ
and still owed the principal sum. It M
will wo think, bo the same In this BJ
Instance. Bosldos they aro asking us BJ
to vote bonds tor electric light lm- BJ
provemont without giving us any BJ
statement showing that the plant Is BJ
paying, how much It has paid, or,' an H
estimate ot its future earnings If the H
proposed Improvements aro made. BJ
nelthor do they glvo you tho prosont H
physical condition ot tho plant. B
It is a woll known fact that 'the Ba
pipe line will soon havo to be re- BJ
placed. The poll lino In town must BJ
bo replaced at an enormous exponso BJ
compared, with tho plants earning 1H
capacity. BJ
Isn't it a fact that tho plant is In fl
such a condition thnt It cannot con- BJ
tlnue Its present patrons without so- BJ
curing more power and having the H
plnnt greatly Improved. BJ
Wo aro at a loss to understand BJ
why, if tho plant has paid, and we H
bellevo It has, that tho net earnings' BJ
have not been put to ono side nnd M
thus bo available for these repairs BJ
Instead of calling on tho tax payers BJ
to voto bonds. M
If tho money has been usod after BJ
having paid taxes for years for its BJ
maintenance by tho general fund, lets BJ
us tho taxpayers, know how much BJ
It Is bo that we can voto intelligent- BJ
ly tomorrow. BJ
It Is unfortunate that moro public- BJ
Ity hasn't been given the public. BJ
TliOy nre entitled to know so that It BJ
tho city government needs their voto BJ
thoy can get It willingly instead ot BJ
voting as we must now do In the BJ
dark. TAXPAYER.
