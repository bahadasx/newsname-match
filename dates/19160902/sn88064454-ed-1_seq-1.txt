The Sleepy Old Thing's Mind
Still Clouded.
In thi I' last week's Bunner a fe.l
low who tried to,, be poetic and ro
Iantic', who sailted ulner the NOM
le PLtMlI. of Rip Van Winkle.
tried to criticist, the Mayor anid
('ouncil in this manner:
"At last I know I uint ill St. Mar
tinville,. for there stands thei same
,,old nirket house. built unny and
many years since and it has still
the samn upp)learanel . for no paint.
nor lime, nor any marks of imi
provenment show therelou. lihe was
told by the good c itizen that
though the authorities had passed
ordinances as to the health regula
tions of lt'h Town, and though the
Town C('ouncil had been ordered
by the proper author:ties to elean
out the old market and scr'een it.
The Mayor and thel Twn (ouncil
still insisted thli the old Market
House haI served their Fathers.
their Gra:.dlf:thers and their great
G;randfatihlirs and what was good
for their ancestors should be good
et.nugh for themn."
This fellow miade ia great Umis
take in awakening because his
mind is apparently dull and cloud
ed, and the best thing lie could do
for the present generaton would be
to sleep in eternal peace, and not
come here, and try to create strife
when there, is no ctause for it.
That fellow, if he had a bright,
clear and unbiased vission or un
derstandinr would know that the
present adn inistration is doing all
in its pl)ower to imiprove the colidi
tion of tlhii town and that nm-ney
has been secured to improve tlhe
Power 1 louse, MARKET I( )U'SE,
Street lights and our Streets. Any
one living here knws these facts,
and shioull not triy to be a critic of
anl athninistration that is doing
e erythinii in their power to do
what th. it pr deccssors never
thought of ldoing.
