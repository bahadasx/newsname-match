that pipmntic international corpora

This resolution acta forth our
claim and contention that the papal
system, ruled by a foreign sovereign,
i promoting a propaganda in
the Limed Mate which is op
poeed to government by the peo
ple and which seeks In destruc
lion of such national institution as
the public school, the free press, the
exercise of free speech and public as
sembly, freedom or thought in mat

and state, are separated and made
independent of each other.
This indictment of the papal sys
tcm further states that its agents
aud manager seek to subvert our
democracy, and to put' ia its place
the papal form of monarchy ; that
the Roman Catholio laity are tacght
by their superiors of the papal sys
tem to blindly obey papal order and
decrees even when they conflict with
the constitution of the United
State; that Rome is perniciously
active in American politic to the
end of capturing political power
and gaining control of thia coun

A eucrcfc Bocicir, uiuwu

augurated a reign ef terror from
wbicV there seemed to be no possible
relief since none dared testify
against them. All eferta to areak
up the criminal organization, or to
briag its murderous agents b jus
tice, failed until a young Irinhmau,
James McParland, was sent into the
region by the Pinkcrtoa Detective
Agency.
McParland finally gained acres
to the meetings and council of the
terrorists with the. result that after
long effort more than twenty of the
leading spirit were convicted and
executed, a many or more fled, and
the remnant, learning that the way
of the transgressor is a hard road to
travel, ceased their depredations.
It was revealed at the trials, ami
by the investigation preceding
them, that the Mollies were Irish
immigrant who had carried on a
similar system of terrorizing in Ire
land as Ribbonmen, Whiteboys, etc.
It is likely that the Mollie Maguires
was originally and intentionally
nothing more or lees than a labor
organization calculated to promote
the mutual interest of its coal
miner members. At such their or
ganization was legitimate, and
mvbt hare been a benefit had there
cot been such a large element of
anarchistic Fenian in its member

Congress is spending inilliona of

seeks preparedness at a compara

through the provisiona of the Lind-

charge with these grave offense to
meet them in a court of competoi.t
jurisdiction and disprove them if
their truth ia not established.
For fire years The Mevace, and
the millions of men and women
who have made it, have sounded the
alarm concerning political Roman
im. The warning has been heard ;
and patriots have rallied in millions
to the defence of our attacked in
stitutions. At the same time Rome's
management and following, refus

McDermott has maintained, in
his continuous fight against tho Hi
bernians for fort)' year, that they
should not be recognized or toler
ated by his church. And it seems
that in the earlier years of his ef
forts to discredit them he had the
upport of other 'local and well in
formed priests. Even ArchhUhop
Woxl, in 1874 and prior to the con
viction or trial of the Mollie Ma
guirw, condemned the Hibernians
as reoiisibIe for the crimes charged
to the Mollies.
McDermott carried on his fight
consistently with purpose to relieve
his church from the odium thut
would rest upon it if it allowed it
self to become identified with Hi
bornianism. He sent representa
tives to tne lhird Plenary Council
at Baltimore asking the hierarchy

He maintains that the inviegling
of youth into the Ancient Order of
Hibernians is a calamity to be
averted by any sacrifi'o; and, for
that reason, told his archibshop in
1908 that before he would partici

resign. He declates that the church

As usual in such cases, Arch
bishop Prendergast forbid publica
tion of the charge, choosing rather
to favor this military branch of the
papal sytteni than to defend papwt
youth from what McDermott de
clares to be its evil tendencies. Mo
Dermott says that under favorablo
conditions the Mollie Maguir out
rages might be repeated. Cardinal
(iibbons has taken the nibernuns'
side; and the high officials of Hi
bcrnianism refuse to say a thing in
connection with the charges.
Under the circumstances, McDer
mott carries bis fight for decency in
to the columns of the Philadelphia
press which carries his statements
creating a tremendous sensation.

The state con ven tioa has been
held, high majs and all, in a way to
positively identify the Hiberuian
ith the papal system. It u said,
however, that thi publicity cauje4
by the McDermott charges is likely
to affect the election of state officers
inasmuch as its state president,
Kil gallen, is in th liqiior busi
r.ess, and it might salt Hibernian
pretense to piety to elect a new
president hoe business conform
more nearly to moral standards.
Perhaps the most illuminative
feature of all the disclosures is the
letter, a fao-simile reproduction el
which appears herewith, from
Joseph Melanghlin, national presi
dent of the Hibernians, to Priest
McDermott, asking the latter's nrp-
pori ior Mcuangiuui m his cam
rairn for election to congress.
It shows how these papist so
cieties are utilized to put papist
into public office. Note the lan-
guage: "It may be you would have
an opportunity among your friends
and people of laying her and there,
in a qutet ray, "a wr& in favor of
my candidacy. Any word von mar
ray in this matter, to be effective, t
need not remind von father, msi
be taiti discretlly.'1
It is thus that the political plan
of the papacy are promoted by
means of priestly electioneering. Ia
this case it probably failed ; but this
is an exceptional ease. McDermott,
though a priet. is o impressed with
the identity of Molly Maguireisni
and Hibernianism, as to be in re
bellion against papal scheming
