-The day
upon which President Wilson is to be
formal, notifled of nis renomination
is being celebrated with enthusiasm
by more than 10,000 persons includ-
ing Democratic leaders from all parts
of the country A drilins rain fell
thruout the morning but it did not
dampen the spirits of the assembled
I Democrats. President Wilson himself
rose early and spent the forenoon
i shaking hands with party leaders and
k t renewing friendships with Xew Jer
5 I sey members of his party.
The notification ceremonies were
held in the afternoon at Shadow Lawn
the president's summer residence.
The president's magnificent white
summer home surrounded by sixty
acres of lawn, presented a beautiful
picture as the arrangements for the
ceremony were completed.
The house was literally covered
with American flags and bunting and
from the tall flag pole floated the
flag of the president of the United
States.
Chairs to accommodate five thou
sand persons were grouped in a semi
circle about the house and there was
room for 20,000 more within hearing
distance of the president's voice.
A temporary addition to the veranda
had been erected as the president's
speaking stand.
Several hours before the time for
the ceremony, 4 o'clock, the gates were
thrown open and crowds poured in.
Members of the notification commit
tee, headed by Senator James of Ken
tucky, arrived here in a body from
New York this morning and members
of the Democratic national committee
and of President Wilson's cabinet ar
rived on every train.
Few Remained Behind.
Because of the necessity of taking
action today in congress to avert the
threatened railroad strike. Speaker
Champ Clark and a few other members-
of congress who had planned to
come were forced to remain in Wash
ington. The president was in com
munication with the White House
throughout the morning and was kept
informed of every development in con-
gress and received word the strike
legislation was practically certain of
1 passage, several Democratic senators
1 telegraphing him that the senate
would adopt the legislation late this
afternoon.
j The president accordingly entered
into the preparations for his notifica-
tion in an optimistic frame of mind
After an early morning walk about the
estate with Mrs. Wilson he received
members of the New Jersey state com
mittee and at 1 o'clock entertained at
luncheon 200 Democratic leaders from
different parts of the country.
Chairman Vance McCormick of the
rational corrmittee; Martin H. Glynn,
former governor of New York, and
Mrs. Glynn, Senators James of Ken
tucky and Reed of Missouri; Secretary
of State Robert Lansing and Mrg.
Lansing; Henry Mcrgenthau. former

those whom the president and Mrs.
Wilson greeted on the broad veranda.

music.
Democratic politics were threshed
r.ut thoroly by the president and other
leaders in many conferences which
took place as the day proceeded. Sec
retary McAdoo, who has. in some
uuarters, been represented recently as
trying to supersede Chairman McCor
mick, announced that he recognized
Mr. McCormick as the head of the
campaign organization. He denied
Fhey were not in accord. All the lead

Secret service men, special
ana policemen from New York

than 200 men had been assigned to
the task of guarding the president.
rue presiaent was confronted the
first thing today by a party snag when
j the state Democratic committee called
to discuss the Jersey situation. There
was a lively fight on between Judge J.
H. Westcott, the president's personal
i friend, and Senator Martine for nomi
! nation for the senate at the primaries.
The president's advisers have indicated
; that Martine seems the certain win

! today that he would not mix into local
I situations anywhere.

"I have not read Mr. Hughes's To
peka speech carefully," said Mr. Bry
an, "but in glancing over it, I did not
notice any new indictment of the ad
ministration. He seems to be follow
ing the line adopted when he started
out by scolding about everything

on any subject.
His speeches have been a profound
disappointment to those who expect
ed his campaign would be conducted
on a high plane. The president has
accomplished more in the way of im

previous president in the same length
of time. Tet Mr. Hughes without the
candor to commend anything that has
been done, is not able to attack these
remedial measures. He ignores them
aid confines himself to searching with
a microscope for minor faults.
"The tone of his speeches is surpris

recognize the fact that the president
has carried a heavy load of respon

out suggesting what he would have
done under the same circumstances.

"It is not an exaggeration to say
that his speeches have greatly im
proved the president's prospects. If

Colorado Vacationists Must
Wait Nearly a Week.
Extra Equipment on Trains to
and From Coast.
Under pressure of the threatened
trainmen's strike which hovered over
railroads In the last week, passenger
traffic thru Topeka during that time
was the heaviest in years. While op
erating departments of western rail
roads were preparing to fight the
strike, thereby getting themselves vot
ed the busiest men In America outside
of the members of congress, passenger
traffic officials ran them a close sec
end. Thousands of tourists and summer
vacationists who, before last Monday,
refused to put any credence in the
possibility of a strike, such as threat
ened, began a wild stampede to get
home on that date. Every train go
ing thru Topeka in the last week Has
been filled to capacity. One Topeka
woman who was in Colorado Wednes
day tried to get home. She was in
formed that every Pull man reserva
tion between there and Topeka on the
Santa Ke had been taken up until next
Wednesday. Many similar incidents
on other roads are reported. Many
fast trains running thru here between
the east and California and Colorado
are carrying extra equipment and have
been doing so for the last week. Rock
Island trains have been crowded.
Union Pacific trains carried fuli ca
pacity. The fear of the strike has robbed
western summer resorts of much
money. Not only did it send thou
sands home by train but as many, in
fear of the threatened shortage of gas
oline, came home in motor cars. Big
motor cars, bearing eastern license
tags, were seen every day this week

and they were headed east. '

Advices received today by the State

traffic manager for the Santa Fe with
headquarters in Chicago, were to the
effect that the Santa Fe would run

would do if entrusted with the office."
"The strike situation which threat-
i ened the country is turned into a na
tional blessing thru the passage by
congress of the Adamson bill." That
was the Commoner's comment on the
settlement of the strike situation. And
in this, also, he ' found occasion to
speak kind words for Democracy.
Gratified at Strike News.
"I am very much gratif!ed at the
news from Washington." was the com
ment on today's telegraph reports.
"It seems now certain that legislation
will be enacted not only avertinp the
strike but establishing the eight-hour
day. The Democratic party has stood
lor this principle for many years.
"The public is interested in having
the hours of labor short enough to en
able wage earners to enjoy home life
and have time to prepare for the re
sponsibilities of citizenship. They can
do neither if they are called from bed
to their work and then must hurry
from work to bed.
"In the case of railway employes,
the 'public has special interest in their
protection against overwork because
the traveling public shares the risks
that come with overwork. As is often
the case, the danger which has threat

After she had gone and the aunt sup

St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 2. After re

was probably the most enthusiastic re

Republican doctrines, Republican
Nominee Hughes came to St. Louis re-
invigorated and ready to ram home
further assaults on th Democratic ad

It was believed that the candidate
would make some further and clearer
references to that portion of his poli

the city having the second largest
German-American population in the
United States. In speeches which he
delivered thru Kansas yesterday
Hughes took occasion to elaborate his
views on the necessity for unity of
spirit in the movement for American

meeting in the Coliseum where his
competitor in the presidential race was
renominated only Three months ago
still further to enlarge on these views.

Those close to the candidate indi
cated today that the governor intend
ed particularly to dwell on the prin
ciple of exclusive federal control of
the militia which he enunciated at
last night's meeting at Kansas City
and on the Mexican policy in speeches
during the next few days. He intends,
it was said, more specifically to out
line exactly what measures- he advo
cates to correct the abuses in govern
ment which he ascribes to the Demo
cratic administration.
Governor Hughes has been consid
erably riled over Democratic declara
tions that his campaign so far has ex
hibited mostly complaints without in
dicating corrective and constructive
remedies. Tonight he proposes- to
answer these declarations, while still

TO END
STRIKE
Order Will Be Recalled if Bill
Passes Senate.
This Is Statement by Brother
hoods Spokesmen.
TO AVOID ALL AMENDMENTS
Plans to Cast Final Ballot by
6 P. M. Today.
President's Signature by Mid
night Is Schedule.
Washington, Sept. 2. "Just as soon
us the house bill, unamended. be
comes a law," A. B. Garretson,
spokesman for the brotherhoods, re
iterated today, "the strike order will
be recalled."
That was all Mr. Garretson would
say regarding the probable time of
calling off the strike.
This was the first official state
ment showing that the house bill was
wholly satisfactory to the brother
hoods. From other sources came per
sistent reports that an arrangement
might be perfected whereby tho
strike could be called off officially
before President Wilson actually af
fixes his signature to the bill.
Any amendment to the house bill in
the senate would throw all the nego
tiation sin the indefinite stage and
with that in mind, administration
leaders made every effort, as the de
bate In the senate progressed, to In
sure passage of the house bill in Its
original form.
At a meeting of the thirteen broth
erhood officials today it was formally
derided that cancellation of the strike
order should not be sent out until
President Wilson actually has signed
the eight-hour bill. Another meeting
of the officials will be held tonight
after the senate has acted on the
house bill. At that time there Is a
possibility that the decision might be
changed.
HoM Up, Says Works.
Senator Weeks said the brother
hood men had jut congress In the po
sition of "stand and deliver."
"If congress accedes to this de
mand." he added, "it is an end tem
porarily, at least, to representative
government."
Senator Owen said he favored the
pending bill because it would avert
the strike and afford congress n op
portunity to consider the railroad
problems In the broader aspects
Debate Hill All Iay.
Washington, Sept. 2. The United
States senate spent today arguing with
itself preparatory to casting the votes
that will say whether or not there Is
to be a nation-wide railroad stiike.
While the senators argued, however,
they were practically agreed that their
votes would be against such a sirike.
They were prepared to put their O. K.
on the preventive legislation proposed
by the president and endorsed by the
house.
By nightfall a new federal eight- '
hour day statute Is expected to be part
of the law of the land, so far as the
senate can make It. By midnight It
is expected to be complete, bearing
the president's signature.
Six o clock Is the hour set for the
vote and a special messenger is ready -
to rush the measure to the president '
down in Jersey,
Scene Spectacular iJist Night.
The senate adjourned at 11 o'clock
last night without finishing its vork
on the bill. Demands for a vote st
that time were overcome by senator
who wished to talk today. The flill
galleries and the tense atmosphere of
last night were not duplicated when
the session opened today but there wa
reason to believe the crowds wouM
gather again to witness the closing
hours of deliberation and the history
making vote.
There were to be two hours of gen
eral debate with thirty minute
rpeeches beginning at noon. Voting
on amendments is to start at 4 o'clock.
At or before 6 o'clock, according to
the number of amendments, the en
ate will vote on the bill itself, which
provides for an eight-hour day at the
present rate of ten-hour pay. and ap
pointment of a commission to investi
gate and report within six to eight
months on the financial results of th
operation of the law.
lilxe House Bill Precedence.
The Adamson measure was given
precedence In the senate when no ob
jection was made to considtr&tion of
the house measure in place of the
longer and more comprehensive bill
prepared by the senate interstate com
merce committee. While & close vote
was expected on Senator Underwood's
amendment authorizing the interstate
commerce commission to fix rates of
pay and hours of labor it was believed
it would be voted down.

grams from Democratic senators to

road workers will pass the senate by
