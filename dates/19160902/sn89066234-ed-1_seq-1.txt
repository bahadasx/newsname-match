SCOTT COUNTY KICKER
Vol. XV
BENTON, MO., SEPTEMBER 2, 191G.
No. 27.
SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE.
Eli Ake Says the Wilson Administration has Made Ev
erybody Prosperous Excepting Poor Wall Street.
POOR WALL STREET.
For the business man, the Fed
eral Reserve act ; for the farmer,
the rural credit system ; for the
manufacturer and merchant, the
Federal Trade Commission; for
the Wall Street speculator, noth
ing. That is the record of the
first four years of Wilson's en
deavors for better business.
1 ronton Register.
During off years BfO, Ake gets
mighty sarcastic and becomes al
most a rebel, but when the party
whip cracks Uncle Eli falls into
line and gives his readers the reg
ular dope. Just now his paper is
carrying hundreds of dollars
worth of court house printing,
which may, to some extent, ac
count for his warped vision.
It is just too bad that those
poor Wall Street fellows haven't
l)ccn able to make ends meet
since the Democrats got in. The
business man, the farmer, the
manufacturer and mechanic have
been in high clover, according to i
Dro Ake, but those poor W all
Street fellows got nothing.
Ell Ake knows lietter than that
He knows that there never was a
time in the history of this nation
when Wall Street prospered at.
during the past two years. He
knows that steel common has ris
en from pure water to almost
par. He knows that the steel
trust cleaned up eighty million
dollar! during the three months
prior to its last financial stnte-
i ''lit. He knows that other Wall
-trcet enterprises have fared eor-
espondingly well.
Then why does he put out such
.riff for his readers? He says
that the Democrats have given
the farmers the Rural Credit!
act. Can he point to a farmer in
his own county, or un. where else,
that has been benefited by it?
Only the banks will be benefit
ted, if anybody benefits. The bor
rower must pay for the use of
this 'emergency currency'' Just
the same as for any other credit,
and the bankers get the profit.
Hut he does not tell the farmer
how this will help him. He omits
details and disses of it in a sin
gle line.
When the Republican! tried to
put thru their -central bank"
scheme the Democrats bowled
against it to beat the band. Es
pecUvlly was Mr. bryan loud. But
when the Democrats got to the
pie counter, they gave the tiling
a different name and put through
for the banks what the Republi
cans had beon afraid to stand for
Dro. Ake must have been na
ping when he penned the lines
above quoted, otherwise he
would have known that the Fed
eral Reserve law had served its
purpose, so far as the fanner is
concerned, and that congress had
fixed up a new dose to fool IliUI
with this fall.
The new gold brick that will be
handed the farmer is the fa.-m
credits bill, or rural credit. The
bone-heads who run this govern
ment admit that the farmer is
just about a goner, and they
think that by getting those who
yet have a little something deep
er in debt, it will save them.
The state is also to have the
land bank. The farmer is to be
supplied with all kinds of money
provided he can furnish the se
curity. Hut that in no way helps
those that mot need help the
tenant farmer, the wage earner,
or the small business man.
Neither the Federal law nor the
state law will be of benefit to the
masses, for they have nothing to
put up as security. Bui whether
the federal farm credit, or the
state laud bank does any business
will not matter. It will provide
soft jobs at high salaries for
many patriotic politicians. And
that is the chief function of cap
italist government.
The Federal reserve act, which
was heralded as the savior of the
farmer, is no longer claimed as
his savior not even by Bro. Ake.
He remembers the -'cotton pool''
of two year! ago. He says it is
for the "business man." It is for
the Big Business man.. The gov
ernment furnishes the money, the
banker loans it and pockets the
profits.
Of course the farm credit! bill
is loaded down with red tape, just
like the postul savings banks.
There is no danger of either the
national or state government in
terfering with the business of the
bankers, so long as the banks are
the government. You may rest
assured that after the fall elect
ion the farm credits bill will be as
vuttle heard of as the postal sav
ings bank has beeii.
The federal and state farm
credits system both provide that
not exceeding six per cent inter-
est frnay be charged. And you
may bet your boots that the limit
will be applied. Yet, today,
farmers who have the necessary
security can borrow from Insur
ance companies at that rnte, and
even less.
Here fas a question I want Bro.
Ake to answer: If the govern
ment can let the bankers have
money for the mere cost of print
ing it, and at the same time pay
the bankers interest on the bonds
put up as security for the money,
why should the farmer pay six
per cent? Why can't the gov
ernment let the farmer have
money as cheaply as it lets the
banker have it? Can you explain
this in any other way than that
it is because the bankers ure the
goveriunent no matter which
old party is in control.
The Farmer and Stockman is
an ably edited farm Journal, The
editor says he has been recelVluj
large numbers of letteis from
funnel's who are interested in the
federal farm credit law. In hi!
last issue he explains its Working
and he does not seem to thinv
that it amounts to anything.
The farmer who cannot borrow
now, cannot borrow under the
new law. Not only that, but be
fore he can borrow he must be
come a stock-holder in the rural
credits bunk, of which there will
be twelve. He writes :
"In our eagerness to do every
thing possible to increase farming
product ivenei! and elficiency we
must not make the mistake of us-
suiniug that any new legislation
is going to Change human nature
or bring about tne agricultural
uiilleuiuui. Farmers Who cannot
get loans uuder the existing
financial system Will not lie en
titled to them under any new
system that might be created for
no law can make a d.shoncst
man honest or increase the ef ft-
ciency of the shiftless. 1 want to
print here a little editorial 1
found in one of the big eastern
paperi, It is quit! to the point:
Any farmer who is plowing
tented land Will make u mistake
if he acts on the assumption that
under the new rural credit law he
will be able to raise money to
buy land. L'tider the new law,
any farmer who ownci his own
home may mortgage it. I'roba
bly he should feel grateful that
the new law at least does not
take from him any of the privil
eges he formerly enjoyed. The
fact remains that his privileges
are not increased. The primary
purpose of the act, as explained
by the Agricultural Department,
is to permit agricultural prosper
ity by enabling farmers to borrow
money on farm mortgage securi
ty at a reasonable rate of inter
est and for relatively long periods
There are to be twelve of these
land banks. But the basis of
these banks is the co-operative
organization of farmers which
will pass upon the credit of those
who seek loans. NO FARMER
t AN BORROW UNLESS HE IS A
SllAUEHOLDEU, und for this
reason many farmers will prefer
to borrow without investing in
bank shares. As u matter of
faet. farmers are already well
supplied with mortgages on reas
onable terms. The insurance
companies huve Sti-lo.'.iu 1,371 in
farm mortgages at an average
rate o.f a jo per cent. The new
law says thut the Federal banks
shall not charge above six per
cent. The farmer Will have to
1 give the same kind of security he
formerly gave, and the new sys
tem will not make a good bor
rower out of a poor one.
Bro. Ake, why didn't you tell
your farmers just what the Dem
ocrats had done for them? Farm
ers are beginning to want details.
Why didu t you tell them thut in
order to enjoy the blessings of the
rural credits act they must first
become members of the national
farm loan association. A local
association must be composed of
at least ten menbers who wilt ap
ply collectively lor not less thai:
$J0,000. If the loan is granted
they only receive 00 per cent. For
the remaining five per cent they
are given bank stock, und must
sign a liability contruct of double
the uuiount oi their bunk stock.
The principle is ull right, but
the high rate of interest und the
oceans of red tupe w ill not make
the law attractive to the farmer.
J Nor was it intended that it
; should. The bulLkers must be ta
1 ken oaf! of first, whether Demo
! ertpits or Republicans rule.
I 4 ! -
Strunge that Bro. Ake failed to
! mention the Clayton luw euueted
I by congress. The . Democrats
j haven't overlooked anything thut
will serve to catch the votes of
the workers.
the Clayton law was hera.de 1
as a great victory for organized
labor. Some 80 years ago con
gress set out to bust the trusts
and the Sherman anti-trust law
was the result.
Up to date, the only trust that
this law has been able to find is
the "labor trust.'' Among others,
the Danbury hatters felt its
weight and were fined a quarter
of a million dollars because tliey
urged their friends not to buy
liiats made by Lowe & Co.
When the Democratic congress
met, Sam Uompers and his labor
lobby were on hand to have this
law changed so as not to apply to
labor umous wmcn was never
intended. Gompers is ia labor
leader of the past century, who
refuses to recognize the class
struggle and supports capitalist
candidates. He had supported
(Wilson and felt that he was en
titled to something.
So the Clayton law was prepar
ed and enacted. This law declar
ed that lubor is not a commodity
or property, such as merchandise,
and therefore did not come under
the Sherman anti-trust law. If
congress wus right, then the su
preme court that robbed the
Danbury hatters was wrong, and
their property should be restored
to them.
But congress was wrong. La
bor is a Commodity that is bought
and sold. However, an old party
statesman or a last century la
bor leader, imagines that if you
take an ox and write him down
la a law book that he is a cow,
the ox will immediately become a
cow .
Another thing the mossbicks
are slow to learn is that it is our
courts and not our legislative bo
dies that makes our laws. Un
fortunately for the Democrats,
the courts are making mince
meat of the Clayton law before
their spell-binders have a chance
to tell the unionists what hail
been done for them. The

employers of labor can blacklist,
and boycott to their heart's con
tent and no court will punish
them. But let Labor try it, and
the "majesty of the law" is right
on the Job.
Labor will never be given any
thing it is not strong enough to
take. To hope for anything from
capitalist politicians is all moon
shine. For a quartfft of a century
Labor has hud its agents at the
state and national legislative
halls begging for relief. What

under the anti-trust laws. Not
another case like thut of Danbu

Now that the Democratic cam

leader to steer- the labor unionists
into the Democratic pen, Uompers
Hays Hughes, the Kepubl can can
didate for president, for his part
in the decision that lobbed the
Danbury hatters. At the tamo

Hughes deserves till that Uoni

why does not Uompers also re

a tabic of figures snowing the

capitalist civilization is about tiu
same in all so-called Christian na
i tiohs, it is fair to assume that the
same figures will bold good In
other countr.es.
According to these figures
there was spent for breweries
$14,410,078 In l'.05, and only $5,

three dollars for brew eries to one
for churches.

What mora could God escpeet of

In 1V05 we spent nearly three

Recently, in Waco, Texas, a city
w ith .''. white churches and no

was taken from the court room
by a Christian mob. He was
taken to the .'pen street where
the 'law arid order ' crowd ui.scn
ed him. stuck knives- in him and
fearfully mutilated blm. Then
they tied a rope around his body
and dragged him through the
streets behind an automobile.
While the automobile slow was
going on, they built a fire under
a tree on the pubi c square.
Then the.v hung the almost life
less body over the fire to roast.
And the mayor, who could see all
this from his office, is said to
have used some cuss words be
'cause he feared the tree would

after the body had been nicely

WOMEN aSUTHEIK FIGHT.
E. V. Debs in Rlpsa w
Woman's battle for the ballot is
being waged with increasing in
tensity in every state of the Un
ion, Eleven states have already
wipe,! away the stain and given
woman the ballot. A number of
Other States have granted a lim
ited franchise.
This is nn (specially important
year for the women In their fight
ri- their political rights. Four
Eastern stales to-wit. New York,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and
New Jersey vote on a constitu
tional amendment this fall to
grant women their political
rights, This amendment i being
fought viciously by all the powers
that maintain sweating hells and
the white slave traffic,
Every socialist and every one
else capable of realising th-' cru
el Injustice done to woman in de
priving her the right to vote and
to have a share in the govern
ment under which she lives, will
appreciate the Importance of this
i6sue and work with all tneir en
ergy to nave tne amendment
which wipes out the dishonor oi
these states adopted by an over
whelming majority.
The man who is so wanting in
sense of fairness aud common jus
tice as to deny to woman the
rights he claims for himself is a
living certificate of the absolute
necessity of releasing woman
from the ignorant aud brutal
domination.
There are only three ways of
acquiring wealth: First, to cre
ate it with your owa labor; sec
ond, to have it given to you ; and
third, to steal it. Those who cre
ate it with their own labor rest
their case here ; the multi-mllllon-n'.re
can now take the stand and
explain how be got his-n.
Stick to the unmuuled Kicker.
