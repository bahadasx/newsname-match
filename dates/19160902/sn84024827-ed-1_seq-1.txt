He passed from the hands of sol

of justice, yet he is said to be con
fined somewhere at Fort Bliss.
Held as Dynamiter.
During the Urn of Villa's, reign in
Juarez, when that town was Med
with gambling houses and dance re
sorts, Hipolito acted as his brother's
collection agent. After the United
States gave Carranza troops permis
sion to move "jver the American line
from Eagle Pass to Agua Prieta to
fight Villa, an indictment was brought
against Hipolito by the grand jury of
El Pa:'j county, charging him with
trying to blow up the railway track
near Fort Hancock. Hipolito then
fled to Havana, where an attempt at
extradition failed. He lived there un
til recently with his wife.

WASHINCTON, Sept. 1. Pre
vention of the threatened railroad
strike through an act of ciigress
seemed assured tonight, after the
House by an overwhelming vote
had passed the Adatr.son eight
hour day law and the Senate had
agreed o take a final vcte on
the measure not later than six
o'clock tomorrow evening.
Although it is possible amendments
may m
ake alterations necessary, it is
iiiot u h,.n ihn mot hu
thought that when the test comes the
House bill as it stands will be accept
ed and rushed to Shadow Lawn. N. J.,
for President Wilson's signature.
And, while no formal announcements
were forthcoming from the brother
hood heads tonight, it is authorita
tively stated that this will result in
the immediate dispatch of code mes
sages calling off the general strike
order for Monday morning.
Brotherhoods Satisfied
The Adamson bill as passed In the
House by a vote of 239 to 56, with
minor amendments, is the same meas
ure which the brotherhoods leaders
officially declared yesterday would
constitute a satisfactory settlement
and prevent a strike.
Senate Amendments
The amendments, added to cor.forru
to a draft framed by the Senate inter
state commerce committee, would fix
the effective date January 1, instead
of December 1, 1916, and exempt rail
roads less than 100 miles long and
electric street and interurban lines.
Briefly, it provides:
Eight Hours Effective January 1
That eight hours shall ba deemed
a day s work and the standard lor
reckoning compensation of railroad
employes operating trains in inter
state commerce after January 1, 1917.
Provides C fmmission
That a commission of three, ap
pointed by President Wilson, shall
investigate the effects of the eight
hour standard from six to nine
months and then report to congress,
present wages' not to be reduced dur
ing the investigation or for thirty
days thereafter, and overtime to be
paid at a pro rata rate.
G. O. P. Also For Bill
It was after a day of hot debate
thpt the House passed the bill, under
a special rule brought in when Repub
lican Leader Mann objected to its
consideration. Less than half of the
Republicans followed their floor lead
er in the opposition and when the fi
nal vote came, 70 of them lined up
with the majority while only 56 voted
against the measure.
Two Democrats Opposed
Just two Democrats, Representa
tives Steele of Pennsylvania and
Black of Texas, stood out against the
bill, and Representative London of
New York, the only Socialist, voted
for it.
Red tape was eliminated as far as
possible to rush the measure over to
the Senate where, after several hours
of lively debate over a bill presented
by its interstate commerce committee
had recessed until eight o'clock.
When the Senate reconvened the
House legislation was there awaiting
action.

CHICAGO, Sept. 1. Convinced that
congress will force them to surrender
presidents of important western rail
roads tonight ordered rescinding or
modification of the freight embargo
establshed in preparation for a gen
eral railway strike. At the same time
the railroad executives , announced
defections from the ranks of the rail
way brotherhoods, and declared they
had enough men to operate the trains
strike or no strike. This was denied
by the brotherhood officials.
Hale Holden, president of the Bur
lington, spokesman for the railroads
In the conferences with President
Wilson, said the railroads are con
vinced congress will force through
the 8 hour day law before the date
set for the strike, but they are tak
ing no chances.
"Forced to Surrender"
"It seems tonight that congress will
make us surrender," Mr. Holden said.
i explaining an order by his freight de-
partment revoking the embargo. "The
Burlington and other roads have felt
today there is little chance for a
strike now. We are revoking our em
bargo so as not to inconvenience the
shippers at all. But we are going a
head with our plans to operate trains
In event of a strike. The strike or
der must be actually revoked before
we let up in our precautions. We
have men enough to run our trains."
Claim Unions Split
While railroad executives were
claiming defection of thousands of
brotherhood members, officials of the
unions, through Timothy Shen, vice
president of the Brotherhood of Fire
men and Enginem;'n, said the rail
ways habitually circulate such stor
ies Rnd they have no fears their men
would not obey the strike order.
Injunctions against calling the
strike were filed by brotherhood men
in various parts of the country includ
ing a number of Santa Fe trainmen
employed in Texas.
