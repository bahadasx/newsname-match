[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, Sept. 2.—Anglo-French
troops are believed to have been
landed at Piriaeus with thg intention
of marching five miles northeast to
Athens and garrisoning the Greek
capital.
No report of an actual landing has
thus far been received. But two dis
patches from Athens today reported
the arrival of allied transports off
Piriaeus harbor and London news
papers declared this undoubtedly
meant that the allies had decided to
put an end to pro-German intrigues
at Athens.
The foreign office today still lacked
confirmation of reports of King Con
stantino's abdication and was with
out further advioes regarding the
progress of the revolution in northern
Greece. In the absence of official
news, diplomats here began to doulbt
the truth of the report that the
Greek king had Quit his throne though
his position is growing more and
more unfavorable.

Piriaeus Indicates the determination
of the allies to settle all problems In
Greece quickly before marching north
ward against the Germans and Bul
garians.
With Italy attacking In Albania,
the allies are now exerting pressure
on the central powers on six fronts.
The Italian movement In Albania will
force the retirement of the Bulgars
from northwestern Greece, If It Is car
ried eastward successfully until it
threatens the Bulgarian flank.
That Rumanian declaration of war
has caused a radical change in Bul
garia's plan of strategy, is reported in
dispatches from Salonika. Since
Rumania entered the war the Bulgars
have made no attempt to push furth
er southward Into Greece, contenting
themselves with fortifying the lines
already seized.
50,000 German Troops.
THE HAGUE, Sept. 2.—Fifty thou
sand German troops have arrived at
the Transylvanian city of Klausen
burg, to check the Rumanian invasion.
The Austrians have evacuated the
city of Ma^osvasarhely, on the main

to President Wilson, Who Will

•A By Midnight,
[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON. Sept 2.—The Unit
ed States senate spent today arguing
with Itself preparatory to casting the
votes that will say whether or not
there is to 'be a nation wide railway
strike. While the senators argued,
however, they were practically agreed
that their votes would' be against
such a strike. They were prepared
to put their ok on the preventative
legislation, proposed toy the president
and endorsed by the house.
By nightfall a new federal eight
hour day statute is expected to be
part of the law of the land, so far as
the senate can make it. By midnight
it is expected to be complete, bearing
the president's signature.
Six o'clock is the hour set for the
vote and a special messenger is ready
to rush the measure down-to New
Jersey. Senate adjourned at 11:00
o'clock last night without having fin
ished its work on the bill. Demands
for a vote at that time were overcome
by senators who wished to talk today.
The full galleries and the tense atmos
phere of last night were not duplicat
ed when the session opened today,
but there was reason to believe the
crowdB would gather again to witness
the closing hours of deliberation and
the history making vote.
There was to be two hours of gen
eral debate with thirty minutes
speeches beginning at noon. Voting
on amendments was to start at 4:00
o'clock. At or ibefore 6:00 o'clock,
according to the number of amend
ments, the senate will vote on the
bill itself, which provides for an
eight hour day at the present rate Of
pay, and appointment of a commis
sion to investigate and report within
six to eight months on the financial
results of the operation of the law.
The Adamson measure was given
precedence in the senate when no
objection was made to consideration
of the house measure in place of the
longer and more comprehensive bill
prepared by the senate interstate
commerce committee. WJille a close
vote was expected on Senator Under
wood's amendment authorizing the
interstate commerce commission to
fix rates of pay and hours of labor,
it was believed it would foe voted
down.
Senator Shafroth opened the debate
today by moving to change Senator
Underwood's amendment so that it
would be specifically stated no em
ploye affected by the bill would be
compelled by its terms to work, that
stopping of work wonld not consti
tute "delaying or obstructing opera
tion of trains," for which the amend-

Senate Takes Little Interest in Proceedings Today Which
Assure Ending of the Crisis
[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.—Assurance that the eight hour legislation demanded by
the railway brotherhoods will be enacted and a strike averted, became doubly strong this
afternoon, when the situation in the senate became of such certainty that the session went
into the doldroms over the cut anid dried aspect of the case.
It appeared a near certainty that the senate would not amend the Adamson bill
passed by the house yesterday. The vote on the measure was scheduled for six o'clock. The
bill, according to present plans, will then be rushed to Shad,ow Lawn for (the president's
signature.

PARIS, Sept. 2.—Th© Germans reoc
cupied a few elements of trenches cap
tured by the French south of Estrees
on August 31 in a very violent counter
attack south of the Somme last night,
it was officially announced today.
The attack on the French lines fol
lowed by a few hours a similar coun
ter-attack on British positions north
of the Somme, which resulted In a
slight German grain. The purpose of
these assaults-it is believed here, was
to relieve some of the depression
caused in Germany by the turn of
events iu the Balkans.
The Germans shelled French posi
tions around Maurepas heavily and
then attacked ^outh of the Somme.
Their losses were very heavy, the war
office said.
In the Champagne region, the Rus
sian contingent landed a few months
ago, again defeated the Germans, dis
persing a German reconnoissance
south of Tahure.
The Verdun sector was the scene
of heavy fighting last night. Thiau
mont and the region surrounding it
came under heavy artillery Are and
the Germans attacked the village of
Kleury, but were repulsed. West of
Pont-A-Mousson (southeast of Ver
dun) the Germans unsuccessfully at
tempted an attack near Fay-En-Haye,
but were checked before they left
their trenches.
Russians Advance.
BERLIN, Sept. 2.—Advancing on an
eighteen mile front against the im
portant railway town of Halitz, the
Russians have occupied the village of
Horozanka, ten miles northwest of
Halitz, in a resumption of their Ga
lician offensive.
The object of the new Russian drive
apparently is to prevent the diversion
of Austro-German troops to the Ru
manian frontier. An official state
ment from the Austrian, war office to
day, admitting slight withdrawals,
said that the Russians attacked in
strong force on the Halitz front in the
angle formed by the Dniester and Zlota
Li pa rivers. Near Ztoorow, on the riv
er Strypa front, the Russians also
achieved some local successes, but
their offensive was stopped by a
counter-attack.
AH other Russian attacks were
beaten off, except at a few isolated
places. The Austro-Germans captur
ed two officers and 407 men.
America's 8^000 Islands.
London Chronicle: Since the Unit

its responsibilities outside the Amer

than 8,000 islands, with a population
of some ten millions and an import
and export trade, mainly with Amer
ica, of over $300,000,000 annually. Of
these 6,000 and odd islands rather
more than 3,000 are in the Philippine
group, seven-eighths of which are

Despite Belief That There

Monday.
APPEAL TO THE COURTS
Member* of American Bar Associa
tion Cheer 8lap at Congress
For Passing Adamson
Bill.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
CHICAGO, Sept. 2.—Strike prepar
ations were continued today-by west
ern railways despite lessening possi
bility of a walkout of the four
brotherhoods Monday. Operatives do
not doubt that the senate will confirm
the action of the house yesterday in
passing the Adaffion bill and thus
postpone a strike!- But jitey plan to
strengthen their positions so that if
an appeal to the courts should reverse
the action of congress, they would be
ready to meet a strike. Between now
and January 1, when it becomes ef
fective, It is expected that ^details of
a general plan of resistance will be
worked out.
Whether the roads will Ignore the
Adamson law and force the govern
ment to sue on its enforcement CT
will themselves take the initiative
and seek restraining orders, has not
yet been determined.
First indications of the railroads'
belief that there will be no strike
Monday was seen today In the lifting
of embargoes on perishable freight
on four western roads. The action
,was accepted generally as Indicating
that operating officials were convinc
ed there would be no strike. More
are expected today.
The roads lifting embargoes were
the Northwestern, Burlington, Rock
Island and the Erie.
Ben Bowen, Milwaukee, general
chairman of the Order of Railway
Conductors on the Chicago, Milwau
kee and St. Paul, admitted today that
1,000 St. Paul conductors have voted
to disregard the strike orders. Rail
road heads claim that they have been
assured 25 per cent of their employes
would refuse to obey a walkout order.
Five hundred lawyers at a dinner of
the American Bar association last
night cheered Frederick W. Lehmann
of St. Louis, former, president of the
association, when he took a slap at
the action of the house at Washing
ton yesterday in' passing the eight
I hour bill. Judges and lawyers sprang
to their feet and stood on their chairs
land howled for three minutes.
Meat prices on the local live stock
exchange took a big drop today as a
result of favorable strike conditions,
indicating all railways will lift em
bargoes. Extremely heavy receipts
also helped to depress the markets.
Hogs dropped back too $11.00 a hun
dred pounds for choice stock, a de
cline of 20 cents from yesterday's
close and 60 cents from the high
mark.

WARM WELCOME
Governor Hughes in St. Louis
Today, Was Met by'Large
Crowd at the Union
Station.
WHITE VESTS AGAIN
Will Rest
Sunday
and Leavti In the
Evening for Naahvil(|B« TShn.,
En
route to the
East.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff,
Correspondent.
ST. LOUIS,' Mo„ Sept 2.—After re
ceiving last night at Kansas City
what was probably the most en
thusiastic reception yet accorded his
enunciation of republican doctrines.
Republican Nomine Hughes came to
St. Louis reinvigorated and ready to
ram home farther assaults on the
democratic administration.
It was believed that the candidate
would make some further and clearer
references to that portion of hiB poli
cies referring to the hyphen in this—
the city having the second largest
German-American population in the
United States. In speeches whioh he
ellvered inrough Kansas yesterday,
iughes took, occasion to elaborate his
views on the necessity for unity of
spirit in the movement for Ameri
canism. He was expected at tonight's
seting at the Coliseum—where his
Jypetitor in tire presidential race
n'as renominated only three months
ago—still further to enlarge on these
views.
With fcvirly hot weather again the
rule, Hughes got back into his white
yests once morp today. That he was
in better physical condition was indi
cated by the way in which the candi
date withstood thqftheat. A few weeks
ago, when he firfF set out campaign
ing, he shed 'rspiration at the
slightest movement. Today he was
literally "trained down fine* and
didn't even look mussed after an en
thusiastic, but hot crowd at the sta
tion greeted him.
The governor and Mrs. Hughes
were touched today by a letter from
a sixteen year old girl in Portland,
Oregon,—name withheld on the gov
ernor's request. £?he wrote that she
had a dream in which she saw and
shook hands with Hughes and Mrs.
Hughes in the white house. She knew
the dream was coming true. The
candidate wrote her a letter himself,
and Mrs. Hughes added a postcript
thinking the little lady for her pre
diction.
In St. Louis today the nominee was
the central figure in an auto parade
on his arrival shortly after eight
o'clock, and was to speak at a
luncheon under the auspices of the
Business Men's league at the Missouri
Atnletic club. Late in the afternoon
he was to shake hands with the pub
lic at the, Hotel Jefferson and at
night speak in the Coliseum. Tomor
row he will rest, leaving at night tor
Nashville, Tenn.
Those close to the candidate Indi
cated today that the governor intend
ed particularly to dwell on the prin
ciple of exclusive federal control of
the militia which he enunciated at
last night's meeting at Kansas City
and on the Mexican policy in speeches
during the next few days. He in
tends. it was said, more specifically
to outline exactly what measures he
advocates to correct the abuses in
government which he ascribes to the
democratic administration. Governor
Hughes has been considerably riled
over democratic declarations that his
campaign so far has exhibited most
complaints without indicating correc
tive and constructive remedies. To
night he proposes to answer these
declarations while still thrusting
away in critical analysis of what, he
considers democratic inefficiency.

SHADOW LAWN, LONG BRANCH,
•N. J., Sept 2.—Overhanging clouds
with an occasional splatter of rain
greeted President Wilson today when
he arose, prepared to take up the
party cudgel and begin his fight, tot
re-election. A land breeze from the
southwest indicated the day would be
warm. A low mist hung over the
ocean. It forcasted possible showers
to mar the gala notification ceremony
scheduled for four o'clock this after
noon.
Despite the cloudy weather, how*
ever, the president and Mrs. Wilson
emerged from the mansion early foi
a stroll about the grounds. The beau
tiful Shadow Lawn estate was aMaze
with color.
Gay bunting and streaming banners
hung from every window and cornice
and about the lawns were hundreds
of American flags streaming from tall
poles.
Thousands of chairs had been set
on the lawn facing the east veranda,
from which the president would speak.
Secret service men, special deputies
and policemen from New York and
Philadelphia were scattered about the
grounds long before the crowds began
to assemble. A total of more tir'f
200
men had been assigned to the task
of guarding the president.
Immediately after breakfast the
president called for the morning
papers to read the latest develop
ments In congress regarding the legis
lation which he had proposed as a
means of averting the strike. During
the night telegrams had been received
from Washington telling of the senate
agreeing to take a vote on the bills
not later than six o'clock this after
noon.
In the meantime, autos and vehicles
of all descriptions, laden with joyful
democrats, had begun to arrive in in
creasing numbers and amid increas
ing din. If the weather man had plot
ted to dampen the ardor of the occas
ion he was sadly foiled. Horns, cow
bells and various other racket devices
contributed a rancoru® chorus to the
general pandemonium and long before
the noon hour voices were hoarse
from cheering.
It was a strange scene to be set in
this colony of stately mansions, back
amid groves of towering cedars and
magnificent hedges. Across the road
from Shadow Lawn is the magnificent
summer estate of Murray Guggenheim,
On every side are the homes of multi
illionaires, in front of which tramped
lusty voiced democrats from all parts
of the country.
The president was confronted the
first thing today by a party snag
when the state democratic committee
called to discuss the Jersey situation.
There was a lively fight on between
Judge J. H. Westcott, the president's
personal friend and Senator Martine
for nomination for the senate at the
primaries. The president's advisors
have indicated that Martine seems
the certain winner with the Irish and
German votes. The president, how
ever, made it clear today that ha
would not mix into local situations
anywhere.
