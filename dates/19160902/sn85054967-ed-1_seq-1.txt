War Critics Predict The
Dual Monarchy's Collapse
Fall of Austria-Hungary will Follow Defeat of Teutonic
Allies, in Opinion of Italian Military Experts.
Montenegro and Albania to be Evacuated
ROME, Aug. 29.—Complete evacuation of Montenegro and
Albania by the Austrians will be the first result of Roumania's en
trance into the war, Italian critics asserted today. The early col
' iapse of the Dual Monarchy, possiWy by the end of the present
: year, was predicted by a majority of the Italian war experts.
; Despite denials from Vienna, it has been learned by the Ita
lian military authorities that Austria has withdrawn nearly a
whole army corps from Montenegro and Albania within the last
six weeks to check the Russian and Italian offensives.
The new menace on the Transylvanian frontier will force the
withdrawal of the remainder of the Austrian forces, it is be
lieved here, leaving only Bulgarian Stoops in Albania to resist the
Italians.
Serious economic troubles, as well as internal disorders in
. Hungary, are expected to follow a successful invasion of Transyl
vania by Roumanians. From Transylvania the Austro-Germans
have derived a large part of their meat supply, as well as large
quantities of Grain.
The majority of the Italian critics believe Roumania will
strike her heaviest blow in an invasion of Transylvania, probably
aided by Russian troops transported across Roumania.

Wilson Announces Progress Is
Made By Legislative Leaders
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.
President Wilson failed this
afternoon in a personal appeal
to have the railway brother
hoods call off or postpone their
orders for a general strike
scheduled to become effective
next Monday morning. The la
bor leaders were with the Pres
ident for more than half an hour
but insisted that either Con
gress must pass the eighthour
day or the railroads must accept
their offer before they could
act. Afterward Secretary Tum
ulty authorized the following
statement: "The heads of the
brotherhoods were unable to
give the President assurances
of any kind." This word was at
once transmitted to the congres
sional leaders.
The Austrians are hastily
evacuating the extreme south-!
eastern corner of Transylvania.'
Pressing westward Rumanian
troops entered Hosszufalu, a
town of 9,000 inhabitants, and
within a few hours had occupied;

It was admitted that the sit

lify all efforts; but when the
1 President left the capitol after
1 being there an hour and 40 min
i utes he admitted that "prog
; ress toward a settlement" was
J being made.
