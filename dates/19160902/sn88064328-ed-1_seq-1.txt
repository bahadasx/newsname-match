pared to paw tomorrow or Satur
day the eight hour legislation
which heads of the employes'
brotherhoods have deVlareil o II i
eially will cause them to telruraph
the code message necessary to re
voke tin* strike order.
Although President Wilson ^till
desires strongly to see his whole
legislative program accepted, and
Democratic leaders in the Senate,
have ideas of their own ahotit
should he done, administration
spokesman virtually conceded to
night that the hill finally passed
would provide only for:
An ciuhl hour day for trainmen
in interstate commerce, effective
December 1, or -la unary 1. with
the present ten-hour rate of pay
and pro rata overtime; and
A small commission appointed
by the President to investigate the
working of the law from six to
nine months and report to Con
grcss.
This, with the date 'December
1. is in substance the Adamson
bill, revised hy Representative
Adanison and Democratic Leader
Kitchin after a conference with
lYesidcnt Wilson, which A. P.
f! arret son. spokesman for the
brotherhoods, said formally late
todav would be considered "a sat
isfactory settlement " and prevent
the walkout.
I*atcr the Senate interstate com
merce committee agreed to report
ont. a similar bill, with the date
January 1, and with roads under
200 miles in length exempt.
Senator Discuss Changea.
The Senate committee worked
until long after midnight and ad
journed to meet afcflin at H o'eloek
tomorrow morning to complete its
report. Although early in the
vening it had Wen definitely de
termined to present only the
measure tomorrow—the Adamson
bill in slightly amended form—
some members still were urging
the entire program originally pro
posed by the President and eonsid
«■ration whs given to a proposal
that, the Interstate Commerce
Commission be empowered to fix
wages for employes of interstate
carriers.
The only important différence
between the committee hill as it
now stands and the Adamson
measure is the fixing of January
3 as the effective date of the eieht
hour provision and the exemption
of steam railroads not over 10d
miles long, electric street and in
ternrban lines. The proposed in

A Record of Achievement.

In control of the government for
nearly four years, and in that time
it lias written more of constructive

has kept the country out of war,
while preserving its honor un

'It has provided for adequate
preparedness against aggression

Tt has preserved that, strict neu
trality which Washington declared
should alwavs he the polier of
the United States.
It has followed in Mexi'o tin
policy of Lincoln, who asserted
the risht of that unhap.ir people
to order their own government.

more general and genuine than all
the people ever enjoyed before, so

These are only some of the larg

The call for aid is not only to
Party Men, but to all pat, riot ii
men and women to serve the na

which must be had to make the
campaign. They contribute to their
church in support of their relig

them to contribute to the support
of their political faith. It would
seem to be not merely a duty but
a privilege for them to be able to
aar that they had given money to
the point of sacrifice to help re
elect the Administration which
has given them peace with honor,
preparedness and prosperity, lit
