'-A RELUCTANT CONCLUSION .
- jti very newspaper man Knows meit
and women tn-his-owri -who :do ndV
like him and never lose an opportuni
ty to show it. Still this same news
paper man goes on year after year be
ing nice to these people; knowing full
welt that it is kindness wasted, but
the average newspaper man is en
dowed with the instinct of -decency
to the least, but, it is lost on such
people. This paper is no exception.
We have never lost an opportunity to
say something nice about a number
of people who never lost a opportuni
ty to return it over the left and with
interest added. Perhaps this is the
right course for a newspaper to per
suebut we are beginning to doubt it.
It is always the right thing to be
kind to people who have the decency
to appreciate it. Do not know but
what the man who knocks his enemies
on the head fares better than the one
who tries to be decent witli them.
With some folks It is impossible to
be decent; they are not built that
way, and naturally resent it when a
newspaper tries to treat them like
they were at least men and women.

A NEW TRAIN '
A new local train was put inservice
between Ellis and Oakley on Monday
morning of this week. It is a local
freight and will make three round
trips a week. By putting this train
on the men will be able to get over
the division between here and Sharon
Springs a great deal faster as it will
do all the switching- between here
and Oakley. West of Oakley there
are only three or four places where
the local freight will amount to very
much and . the regular-, trains can
take care of that very nicely Ellis
