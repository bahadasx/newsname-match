SENATE EXPECTED
ACCEPT STRIKE BILL
/IS IT PASSED
Administration Leaders Firmly Believe Adamson Measure,
Approved by Wilson and Formally Accepted by the
Brotherhood Heads as Meeting Their Demands, Will
Go Through Upper Chamber Without Any Delay in
Conferences
VOTE TO BE TAKEN AT 6 O'CLOCK TONIGHT;
WILL RUSH 1 TO WILSON FOR SIGNATURE
Chiefs Have Code Messages Ready to Send Broadcast to Re
voke Order Which Would Have Paralyzed Country's
Transportation Systems Monday Morning; All Dan
ger or Strike Is About Over
Washington, Sept. 2. —The enact
ment Into law of enough of President
Wilson's program to prevent the rail
way strike seemed assured when the
Senate reassembled this morning at 10
o'clock with a program which calls for
a vote not later than 6 o'clock this
evening.
It was the belief of administration
leaders that the Adamson bill as it
passed the House late yesterday, ap
proved by President Wilson and form
ally accepted by the labor leaders as
meeting their demands, would event
ually be accepted by the Senate, thus
obviating a delay in conference to
reconcile differences with the House.
As soon as the perfected bill finally
Is passed a special messenger will
carry it to the summer Whte House
at Shadow Lawn so the President may
sign it at once and end the menace of
a general paralysis of the country's
t ransporation lines at 7 o'clock Mon
day morning.
Amendments Proposed
The first amendment proposed to
day came from Senator Shafroth,
Democrat. He proposed to fix Senator
Underwood's amendment empowering
the Interstate Commerce Commission
to make wage schedules so that no
employe would be compelled to work
lor the rate prescribed.
Senator Hard Wick, Democrat, de
claring Congress was being held up
by the railroad employes, spoke for
the adoption of the Underwood
amendment.
"We will not measure up to what is
required of us," he said, "unless we
not only bridge over the crisis but
also provide that there never can
arise again in this country an oppor
tunity for any man or set of men,
railroad managers or workers, to
seize this government by the throat
as is now being done. If we do not
do this, I, for one, will feel that we
have made a sorry trade as well as a
sorry spectacle of ourselves."
Senator Thomas also proposed an
amendment to make it a misdemeanor
for any person to delay or obstruct the
operation of trains punishable by a
tine of not more than SSOO or im
prisonment for not more than one
year or botii.
House to Take Final Action
When the House convened. Demo
cratic leaders had arranged a program
to insure final disposition of the eight
hour railroad hill by to-night if the
Senate acts.
"We are first taking up some private
hils, and will then recess until we get
the eight-hour bill back from the Sen
ate," said Democratic deader Kitchin.
The brotherhood leaders still de
cline to say whether they will send
the code word meaning "satisfactory
settlement" to the general chairmen
immediately upon passage of the bill
or hold it off until it is signed by the
President. It is generally believed,
however, that the message calling off
the strike will go out as soon as both
Houses have acted. They have no
fear that the President will not sign
the bill if it takes the form now indi
cated.

ney Paul Sherwood, of this city, was

Holds Moderate Betting
on Baseball Not Gambling
By Associated Press
New Orleans, La., Sept. 2. —Judge
V. J. Stentz, of the city court, in a
derision on file to-day holds that mod
erate. betting on baseball games does
not constitute gambling.
"Baseball is not in any sense a gam
bling game," he said. "It is primarily
a game of science, physical skill and
tiained endurance. The court believes
baseball a model form of physical de
velopment and exercise which tends to
promote skill in the use of the arms,
and a bet thereon, if not excessive, id
reco\ erable."
Judge Stentz accordingly ruled that,
a plaintiff in a case before him was
entilled to recover a SSO bet, ignoring
the defendant's plea that it was a gam
bling transaction and Illegal.
