Solemn and Impressive cere
monies attended the burial at
I'eorla of the Most Rev. Archbishop
John Lancaster Spalding, who died
last Friday following a long Illness.
Services were held Tuesday morn
ing in St. Mary's Cathedral, where
he presided for many years as
Bishop ot Peoria. Solemn pontl
ficlal requiem high mass was cele
brated by the Right Rev. Edmund
Mi Dunne, DIshop of Peoria, as
sisted by the Very Rev. D. J. Rior
dan, of Chicago, as deacon of the
mass. The funeral oration imme
diately following the mass was de
livered by the Most Rev. George
W. Mundeleln, D. D Archbishop of
Chicago.
Escorted by uniformed guards the
body was taken to the cemetery
and placed In a temporary vault
pending the construction' of a per
manent memorial chapel planned
by Archbishop Spalding before his
death. Among the dignitaries pres
ent were Archbishop Moeller, of
Cincinnati; Bishop Brossart, of
Covington; Bishop Fitzmaurlce, of
Erie, and Coadjutor Kelly, of the
Bishopric of Detroit. Flags flew at
half-mast In Peoria and many busi
ness places were .closed at the hour
of the funeral.
A solemn requiem high mass for
Archbishop Spalding was held at 9
o'clock Tuesday morning at St.
Augustine's church, Thirteenth and
Broadway. Thirty priests took part,
and representatives from the vari
ous convents of Louisville and vi
cinity were present. Bishop O'Don
aghue preached the sermon and the
Rev. Francis Felton celebrated the
mass, while the Rev. 0. P. Raffo
was deacon. The Rev. George
Schuhmann was master of cere
monies. The late Archbishop was tho
founder of St. Augustine's church,
and his work during his stay In
Louisville was told by Bishop
O'Donaghue. Many friends of the
Spalding family attended the mass.
John Lancaster Spalding was
born June 2, 1840, In Lebanon,
Ky. Early In the days of his boy
hood ho began to show ' signs of
the priestly vocation and set about
fitting himself for that calling. He
took his preparatory course at St.
Mary's College, near Lebanon, after
which he went to St. Mary's Col
lege, Emmettsburg, and from there
to Mount St. Mary's at Cincinnati.
Young Spalding then attended the
Catholic College at Louvaln, Bel
glum. Among his classmates at
this latter institution was Arch
bishop Rlordan, of San Francisco.
During the next year young Spald
ing went to school in Rome, where
he completed his studies prepara
tory to being ordained.
In 18G5 ho was ordained a. priest
with solemn services at the Cathe
dral of the Assumption In Louis
ville. Even at that time his genius
was manifested and the fact that
he promised to become a scholar
of rare attainments came to the
attention of Archbishop Blanchet,
of Oregon, who chose him as his
theologian at the second Plenary
Council at Baltimore in 1866. With
Father Hecker, the Paullst priest,
and Archbishop Ryan, of Phila
delphia, he was selected t3 preach
at the council. He was at this
tlmo but twenty-six years old and
tho honor attached to his selection
soon gained him natlon-wldo fame.
He returned to Louisville lit the
conclusion of tho council at Balti
more and became a prleBt at the
Cathedral. While In this capacity
ho devoted his labors to securing a
church for negroes. At that tlmo
St. Augustine's parish, then on
Broadway, near Fourteenth street,
was a mixed parish, the congrega
tion being both white and colored.
Father Spalding set about to es
tablish a negro church. The re-
' suit was tho founding of tho new
St. Augustine's church near tho
same location devoted only to the
negroes in 1868. Father Spalding
became pastor of this church, serv
ing In that capacity for one year.
In 1872 death claimed his Illus
trious uncle, tho late Archbishop
M. J. Spalding, for years one of.
tho foremost figures in the Catholic
world and who was known interna
tionally as one of tho most learned
men of America. Father Spalding
then left his parish In Louisville
and went to live at the Houso of
Paullst Fathers in New York City
until his uncle'B biography was com
pleted. Father Spalding never re
turned to Kentucky as a priest,
but from the metropolis, where he
was an assistant priest, ho was
called to the newly erected diocese
of Peoria. He accepted the respon
sibility and was consecrated Bishop
of Peoria in St .Patrick's Cathedral,
New York City, May 1, 1877. Here
his work In the annals of the Cath
olic ohureh bus been writ large.
Schools, churches and charitable in
stitutions sprung up everywhere;
waning parishes waxed. Strong again
o and a strong and purposeful prlest-
hood had been formed soon after
ho was Intrusted to guide the des
tinies of the church. At the time
ho took charge of the 'Peoria dlo
ceso there were flfty-ono churches
In the district. At his death there
wero 250 churches.
CATHOLIC TEACHING.
From an article on the functions
of the Catholic schools and their
place in tho general educational
system of tho country, written by
the Rev. John J. Wynne, editor of
the Catholic Encyclopaedia, jve take
the following excerpts:
Those who regulate, as well as
those who teach In Catholic schools,
aro not accustomed to think of
competing with tho public schools.
Now and then there Is a friendly
competition, but it is never motived
by antagonism. Occasionally some
one speaks of the public schools as
fcodless. but that does not mean
that every Catholic is prompted to
detract tho good work they are do
ing. Surely It Would bring censure
on any teacher In the Catholic
schools to speak disparagingly of a
public school or of Its pupils.
Many a Catholic priest and
Bishop has received his education
in these schools, and vast numbers
of their teachers have been edu
cated in Catholic schools. There
Is' no occasion for mutual mistrust
or antagonism between tho two
Bystems. It is rare to find a public
school principal or teacher who
does not appreciate tho value of re
ligion in education and deplore the
fact that it is not practicable to
provide for the proper religious
training of every child.
For the Sunday-school Is not
enough, and the home Is not always
so circumstanced that It can pro
vide thorough and systematic train
ing of this sort. Even an extra
hour or so added to the ordinary
school tlmo every day, as advocated
by some who favor the Gary sys
tem, will not satisfy the needs of
tho children. To be effective re
ligion must be an Integral part of
any school course, and It must bo
taught by those who live It In ex
perience as well as by profession.
To say that it is impossible to
make it part of an educational
course Is proved false by the fact
that In over 7,000 educational In
stitutions it is a part, and taught
in sucu a manner as to miiuence
the conduct of the pupils. Why
claim that it must be forever
ostracized In common school pro
grammes of study, because it is
Impossible to teach any one relig
ion that will satisfy all? Is it pos
sible to teach any one system of
philosophy that will satisfy all?
Or. Is there any course of history
that will satisfy all? Thoso who
appreciate its valuo find no diffi
culty in determining how to teach
It.
It Is admitted on all sides that
Catholics have found a way of giv
ing religions formation to tholr
children. They did not do so with
out sacrifice and hardship; but they
have been amply rewarded. They
know now what influence it Is thai
keeps their homes together, not
scattered by dtvorco and not de
pleted of children. They knowalso
why it is their churches are never
empty during dlvino service, and
why In most churches several serv
ices are necessary to satisfy con
gregation after congregation. It
used to be predicted that as the
generations of immigrants with
their Old World faith disappeared,
the new generation born on this
soil would be Indifferent, If not
creedless. Owing to the Catholic
school the prediction has been more
than falsified as each new genera
tion appears.
Tho Catholic school system Is
now strongly established throughout
tho country, and It Is growing rap
idly In number and organization. In
1910 there wero 4,845 Catholic
schools; in five years there wero
1,043 more. Then there wero
1,237,251 pupils; now there are
260,698 more, and the signs are
that they will grow still more rap
Idly and solidly during the next
Ave years. No intelligent Catholic
now questions the wisdom of the
system or begrudges the sacrifice
It requires; nor is there now tho
pressure that thirty years ago was
often exercised from without Cath
olic circles to prevail on parents to
shun the Catholic and patronize the
public school.

CARDINAL
Declares Great Good "Will Itcsult
From Ite'cent Federation
Convention.
Plan For Education of Masses
Meets With Catholic
Favor.
Better Understood and Appreci
ated Than They Have Been
Heretofore.
LOYAL AND PATRIOTIC CILIZENS
Last Sunday Cardinal Farley
gave expression to the following,
which will be read with much In
terest by Catholics and all right
thinking people throughout the
country: ,-
The Catholic societies which have
just finished their deliberations dur
ing "Catholic week" are organized
for the purpose of providing the
machinery to educate, crystallize
and give expression to the opinion
of the Catholic citizenship of the
Nation on public questions affect
ing morals and religion. The pur
pose of these societies has been best
served through their conventions
ust completed In New York.
These conventions have been of
such Importance that they have at
tracted the attendance and Interest
of my two American colleagues in
the Sacred College of Cardinals, the
Apostolic Delegate, the official rep
resentative in this country of the
Supreme Pontiff; Archbishops, Bish
ops, hundreds of Monslgnorl and
priests and thousands of earnest,
serious and right-thinking Catholic"!
laymen and laywomen. Those who
have attended tho conventions, who
have spoken at the various meet
ings and who have been responsible
for the expressions of the societies,
came from all parts of the country.
They are by reason of their experi
ence well qualified to represent and
speak for the Catholic citizenship of
the nation. Very naturally these
Catholics of different ranks and
from different parts of the country
have come to know and understand
each other better.
The press of the city and of the
nation, both secular and Catholic,
has very kindly and generously
given full and accurate reports of
the proceedings And deliberations
of the conventions. Nation-wide
publicity has therefore been ac
corded to the ylews of these rep
resentative Catholics. As a result
of this publicity our non-Catholic
fellow-citizens have come to know
the views- of the Catholics of the
nation and the Cathdlics therefore
will be better understood and ap
preciated than they have been here
tofore. Our fellow citizens outside of
the church will appreciate that we
have no political ambitions us an
organization, and that we are loyal
patriotic American citizens, ready
and willing to make every sacrifice
ror our country; that we stand
firmly for those things which will
make for the moral and religious
progress of the nation; that we seek
from and are willing to give to
them support in all moral move
ments that will tend to make this
nation a better one. As a conse
quence the selfish ahd unscrupulous
calumniators of the church will re
ceive less" attention and will thus
be limited in their power for evil.
The outcome of the conventions
may be summed up in the statement
that a better understanding will
exist among the Catholics of our
country of all ranks on the ono
hand and between the Catholics and
the -hon-Cathollcs on the other.

BEIKJVED PRIEST GONE.
The death of Rev. Joseph T.
Keelty last Sunday morning caused
widespread sorrow in St. Louis
Bertrand's church parish, where
he was known and loved by many,
and especially In the ranks of tho
Hibernians, he having been chap
lain of Division 4 for the past two
years, the members surprising him
this past June with a purse in
silver on the occasion of his silver
jubilee to the priesthood. With
characteristic modesty Father
Keelty had not announced the date
and the anniversary had only been
found out through chance on the
eve ot his departure to St. Mary of
tho Springs, Ohio, whoro the Do
minican mother house Is located
ahd where Sister Constance Keelty,
a sister of Father Keelty, Is Prior

The following tetter from Belfast
to the Irish Press and News Service,
the second of the series, shows the
conditions in Ireland up to August
12:

fast are employing nearly 30,000"
hands at present, which with tho
munition supply factors makes the
one antl-Natlonallst city of Ireland
a bee-hlvo of Industry as compared
with neglected and suffering Dub
lin. But the workers are not all
residents of Ireland. Many have
crossed over from England and
Scotland, thinking to escape con
scription by working on ship con
struction destined for the transport
service. One-third of tho permanent
population of Belfast Is Nationalist,
but they do not hold the best posi
tions in the shipyards or factories.
They have a hard time living under
the oppressive taskmasters, espe
cially since the Dublin uprisings.
Many of them have been discharged
for alleged sympathy with the
rebel and are scorned for not en
tering the army. They do not pass
through Sandy Row and In turn do
not permit their enemies to spend
their time in High street In West
Belfast.
Devlin's Nationalist Club Is
crowded nightly and his organ, the
Irish Times, has become only mod
erately Nationalist In tor.a. The vot
ing lists of West Belfast are
scrutinized cloesly, every death or
removal Is noted, the effect on the
register of vacated houses Is
watched and counted daily, as Jo
seph Devlin has become the most
powerful political leader In Ire
land. He is the only member of
the Irish party with a Protestant
democratic following and his friends
claim an increased support from
that element which will offset the
loss of old supporters who have
left him because they oppose his
plan of separating portions of
Ulster from the remainder of Ire
land. The Ulster clergy, as a jHIo,
of all denominations oppose the
partition, and I was suprised to
hear some officers of the Bank of
Ulster say they much preferred
home rule for all Ireland to the
partition plan, which would hurt
Belfast trade and banking with
other sections of the country.
Sir Edward Carson is faced with
a split among his own followers.
The feeling over the conduct of the
war has divided his supporters into
two classes, one faction approving
his criticism of the Government, thq
other appearing to believe that his
course gives comfort to the enemies
of the British Government In other
lands. Despite all reports there Is
no possibility of his effecting a
truce with Joseph Devlin as the bit
terness of feeling between the two
factions has been increased since
the April rebellion and is Intensi
fied by tho persecutions under tho
defense of the realm act and the
execution of martial law.
Joseph Devlin claims credit for
22,000 Nationalist recruits for the
British army in tho Province of
Ulster, while Sir Edward Carson'
says his aide furnished 43,000 men,
Good judges of tho rival claims fix
the Devlin recruits at 12,000 and
tho Carsonites at ,30,000.
An American moves about much
more freely In Belfast than in Dub
lin, where a constant system ot
espionage prevails, and on the whole
( have been well treated here.
Wherever you move about the city
you see wounded boys, many
wrecked physically for life, and you

One fund distributed recently to de
pendents amounted to $480,000. A
special hospital is being established
In Belfast for men without legs or
arms, solely for the use of the
Ulster Volunteers.
I inquired as to the eighty-three
names on the casualty lists In the
town of Ballymoney and learned
that all but six were Carsonltes. In
Armagh and Down towns the per
centage was not quite so high, but
nearly so. If the other British
casualty lists are as high as the

must be losing 30,000 men per

That tho independent and Bull

In the Presidential race is evidenced
by the dally notices of this and that

their attitude showing that they
had waited for the Hughes cam

they have been grievously disap

of acceptance, has published a state

he will support Wilson, one of his
ten reasons being In support of tho
above argument, and the sentiment
is typical of the average Progressive

says:
"Like many other voters, I am

which the speeches of the Republi

fault-finding, even where faults are
not to be found, Ignoring virtues,
even where they are obvious, and
proposing nothing definite of his

device which ill befits Mr. Hughes.

sadly disappointed In the Hughes
campaign thus far and the bosses
of the party are kicking themselves
for fair. They realize now that
they were imposed upon, that
Hughes as a candidate Is a 100 per
cent, lemon, and that a more suc
cessful canvass could have been
made by Senator Weeks, Senator
Cummins or any other of tho prom
inent convention possibilities. To
make it all the more humiliating, if
Hughes Is elected they are not sure
of their prestige as bosses, so be
tween their unctartaln future and
the dead campaign of the Ice water
twins, Hughes and Fairbanks, the
G. O. P. is In a sad way.
It Is amusing to read the Repub
lican press, which tells of "ring
ing" speeches of the Republican
candidate, the paid press agents
writing this having the time of
their life trying to Inject life into
the campaign. Our local Louisville
Herald, which said before the con
vention that "Hughes didn't call for
much," Is- now laboriously trying to
obey the voice of it's master, but it
Is some task.
For the good of the Democratic
party here In Kentucky a quietus
should be put upon the controversy
over election commissioners, etc.,
the whole doing the party no good,
and the Issue at stake will be of
no consequence If the party should,
become the minority party because
of factional fights. To the average
Democrat the attitude of Gov. Stan
ley seems right In opposing tho in-
terference In party affairs of Percy
Haly, who was placed on tho shelf
for good and all by the Democracy
of Kentucky last year, and tho
thread by which he still hangs on
is due to Beckham's seat in the
Senate. That honor, as everyone
knows, was due to tho misguided
attitude of some Democrats in tho
primary ot 1914, and there is no
chance of that mistake ever being
repeated. In opposing the attempts
ot Percy Haly to again get in tho
Democratic party councils tho mem
bers of that party aro with Gov.
Stanley, right or wrong.
