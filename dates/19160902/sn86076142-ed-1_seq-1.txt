VICTORY FOR
THE GERMANS
(Br Associated Press.)
.WASHINGTON, Sept. 2. "Just as
soon as the House bill, without any
amendments, becomes a law," A. U.
Garretson, spokesman for the brother
hoods, reiterated this afternoon, "the
strike order will be recalled."
Cancellation of the strike order will
not be sent out until after the presi
dent signs the eight hour bill. This
was decided at a meeting of the 13
brotherhood officials. Another meet
ing will be held tonight after the
Senate has acted on the House bill.
Then the decision may possibly be
changed. " Garretson's announcement
was the first official statement that Senate is being put under involuntary
the House bill was wholly satisfac
tory to the brotherhoods.
Throughout the day the Senate was
busily engaged in discussion of the
eight hour law, which passed In the
Iiduse yeBterday, and Its passage late
this evening seemed' assured when
the Senate convened,' although there
is a possibility that Senate leaders
will force an amendment which would
make impossible its final acceptance
by the House.
It is believed, however, that the
Adamson bill aa passed by the House
and approved by the president and
formally accepted by labor leaders
will eventually be accepted by the
Senate. When the bill haa been
passed a special messenger will carry
it to the summer White House for
the president's signature.
Several senators expressed the be
lief that Congress is .being held Up
by labor and charged that the

servitude.
Labor organizations were assailed
for efforts to prevent the enactment
of a compulsory arbitration law.
Senator Sherman charged the presi
dent with making a "petty political
bargain on the eve of an election."
In general, the Republicans opposed
the measure. Many voiced the con
viction that Congress should take
action to prevent the country from
being confronted by the same crisis
within a short tlme.
Senator Newlands offered an
amendment to make it a misdemeanor
for any person or persons to interfere
with the operation of trains punish
able by a fine not exceeding $100 or
imprisonment for six months or both.
This, he declared, followed exactly
existing legislation relating to inter
ference of transportation of mails.
. When the House convened the lead
ers arranged a program to Insure
final disposition of the eight hour law
by tonight if the Senate acts.
Brotherhood leaders still decline to
commit themselves, but it is generally
believed they will call oft the strike
as soon as both houses have' acted.
They have no fear the president will
not sign the bill if it takes the form
indicated.
