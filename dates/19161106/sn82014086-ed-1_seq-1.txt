WILSON WIRE8 THANKS
TO CAMPAIGN WORKERS

word of the campaign to the men who
have worked to bring about his re
election. The telegram, sent to every

though I take this means of urging
you to renewed exertions and vigi
lance to me that belated efforts to
onfnM the oublio judgment do not
succeed.
Steps to Pro tact Industries.
"Our country la proapeous. secure
and hat and tte prosperity Is upon
a. sound basis. Steps to protect our
commerce and industry In any emer
srenor after the' European war ends
CAMPAIGN TODAY
have been taken. The anti-dumping
clause of the so-called war revenue
act provides the executive with ample
power to prevent the 'dumping" of
European surplus manufactures upon
our markets.
Desirable Tariff Legislation.
"The tariff commission will shortly
be appointed and at work to provide
the facts which will determine what
other legislation is necessary or de
sirable. I need not add that the fed
eral reserve act is a guarantee against
panics and that the federal trade com
mission will aid as it already has
helped, to preserve the stability of our
domestic and foreign commerce.
Urges Precaution.
"I am confident that the time has
passed in America when votes can
be bought, the ballot box defiled by
corrupt practices, or the judgments of
the American people determined or in
fluenced in any way by the use of
money. It is, however, our duty to
take every precaution, lest conscience
less agents of the sinister forces work
ing in opposition to progressive prin
ciples and popular government resort
in their desperation to industrial co
ercion or to the evil and insidious
practices of a decade and more ago."
OUTCOME OF ELECTION
IN MASSACHUSETTS
Depends Largely Upon the Trend of
the Progressive Vote.
Boston, .Nov. 5. The outcome in
Massachusetts on Tuesday depends
largely on the trend of the progressive
vote' of "1912. Up-to 'that year, while

republican in ' presidential contests.
President Wilson received 172,408 votes
against a combined vote of 298,176 for
Taft and Roosevelt.
This year the progressive party has
disappeared from the official ballot.
Believing that a majority of its for
mer membership has returned to the
republican ranks, Republican State
Chairman Edward A. Thurston claims
everything with the exception of the
present democratic state minority in
congress, with pluralities for Hughes
and state candidates of from 75,000 to
100.000.
Democratic Chairman i Michael.' TA.
O'leary concedes nothing beyond
majority for congress and the state
legislature. He looks for democratic
pluralities on the national, senatorial
and state tickets, varying from 5,000
to 20,000.
The prohibitionists, who have a rec
ognized official standing for the first
time in the state, have made an active
campaign and claim to have attracted
a large number of progressive irrecon
cillables.
The republicans now hold the state
offices, two seats in the United States
senate and 12 of the 16 seats in the
national house of representatives. Gov
ernor Samuel McCall is opposed by
Frederick W. Mansfield, who surprised
his party by winning the nomination
for governor of the democrafic primary
when the support of the party leaders
generally had been given to General
Charles H. Cole.
A departure will be the election of
a United States senator bj. the people

BOTH PARTIES ARE

20,000 Majority For Hughes, Between

New Haven, Conn, Nov. 6. With
the campaign virtually closed, both

paign managers claimed Connecticut

J. Henry Roraback of the republican

estimates that President Wilson will
carry the stats by between 10,000 and
16,000 majority.
Aside from 4-he presidential outcome,
chief Interest centers in the race be

the republican state committee, that
Maine would return a plurality for
Hughes on Tuesday of 12,000 to 15,000
votes. Democratic leaders, who like
the republicans had made no cam

HUGHES IN ILLINOIS.
Neither the Labor Vote Nor the Worn-
- en's Vote is to Change That State. ;
New York, Nov. 5. Neither the labor
vote nor the women's vote is to Chang j
Illinois from a strong republican
state, in the opinion of William G.
Edens, secretary of the Central Trust
company of Illinois, who called at re
publican headquarters today. - Mr.
Edens, who at one time was on official
of the Brotherhood of Railway Train
men ana nas a wide acaualntance
among labor leaders in different parts
ui ine country, aeciared that there has
been a strong swing towards Hughes
in Chicago and Illinois within the past
week Which will land the republican
candidate safely on Tuesday. "Tha
attempt ot tne officers of the railroad
brotherhoods to deliver the votes of the
railroad men to Wilson is reacting,"
said Mr. Edens. "There mav be 8om
slight defection among the trainmen as
a result or the Adamson law, but It wfll
nave nttie etiect on the result of tha
campaign. I have talked with a num
ber of officers of railroad unions In
the last week or so and I find that they
are up In arms against the national
officers for attempting to deliver them '
politically. They are susnicioiM in
the so-called eight' hour law, but axe
more resentful over the way their of
ficers have attempted to deliver them
to Wilson.
"The claims of the democratic lead
ers that the women's vote in Illinois
will be overwhelmingly for Wilson are
not based on fact I have talked with
a great many women voters who are
enthusiastic for Hughes and the en
tire republican ticket. Illinois may .be '
safely placed in the republican, column.
Of that I am sure."
