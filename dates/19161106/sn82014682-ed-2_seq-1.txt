HARRY BALDWIN SAYS
STORY OF DEMOCRATS
"ABSOLUTELY FALSE''
. Point Hinges on Similarity of
Sample and Official Ballots;
,D Governor: Desperate Trick,
G. 0. P. Leaders Claim
Because of Information which he
has received from Maui to the effect
that sample ballots for senator have
been printed so near like the ifficial
senatorial ballot that he believes this
difference might be easily passed over
by unwary Inspectors. Wade War en
Thayer, secretary of the territory, to
day sent 22 copies of a circular wire
leu message to official polling author
ities on the Valley Island,
r -Word ', of the sample balloU waa
GJsent to the secretary by request of
Dr. J. II. Raymond, who is said to be
111, the letter itself being written by
H. C. Mossman, clerk in the tax office
at Wailuku. It.declares that informa
tion leads to the belief "that an at
tempt v ill be made to have certain
voters deposit those ballots in tne
ballot box, bringing out with them the
official ballot to he used on the next
voter .-' tinder a ( chainless : ballot
'".' scheme.'
By wireless from. Maui this morn
ing Harry Baldwin characterized the
charges as "absolutely' false and made
purely for political advertisement, as
he (Raymond) is desperate."
Secretary "Thayer says that while
it is too late foan investigation now
to go thorouglffy Into the facts, he
will do what can be done to probe the
'-''.occurrence.-;
Republicans in Honolulu laughed at
, the story this morning' and several
said they were convinced it is an
eleventh hour trick directed against
the G. O. P. candidates on Maul in
the hope of benefiting Dr. Raymond.
Secretary Thayer's ywlTeless mes
" sage, sent out to the chairmen of 22
polling places, is, as follows:
fou art warned against voting of
a sample senatorial ballot printed cn
paper similar to official ballot; top
edge smooth; black lines show
through paper; words 'Sample Ballot'
in small type beneath words Territo
ry cf Hawaii. Allow no Illegal use of
this ballot."
With the letter from Mossman.
which was sent to Governor Pinkhara
and by him turned over to the secre
tary for action, are furnished copies
of the alleged dangerous ballots and
prepared affidavits of two employes
in the office of. The Weekly Times at

One of the developments in the anti-vice

Another development was the re

A third was the statement by lead

Everett officials determined to re

time of the shingle weavers' striae
not long ago many I. V.. W. men
flocked into the city and abused the

that they were ordered away at that

Leaders in Close Touch. With
Situation Say Oahu Will
Net Him 1000
A "clean sweep" for Delegate Ku
hio, with a majority of at least 1000
votes on Oahu alone, is the prediction
Ov Pepublican ' pariy leaders regard
ing the general election tomorrow. The
opinion in G. O. P. circles is that Ku
hio will win "hands down," polling a
larger vote than ever before.
Party leaders who' have been closely
associated with Kunio and other Re
publican candidates during the cam
paign which closes today, have made
the following prediction ; which cov
ers not only the delegateship but the
senatorial and house tickets and the
bond issue:
In the senatorial ticket the party
will elect two without any doubt on
Oahu and might lose one, Correa, un
less the fourth district voters adhere
to the straight ticket. In the fourth
district on the house, the party will
elect five and probably lose one. In
the fifth district there are possibilities
of Kupihea and Miles, Democrats, be
ing elected. Aside from these all oth
er Republican candidates will be
elected. .
On this island Kuhio will have a
majority of 1000 votes; on Maui about
four to one; on Kauai the voting
will be about even; On Hawaii Kuhio
will win by three to one. This is con
sidered a very conservative estimate.
On the bond issue the belt road pro
posal and the public baths, building,
will, certainly carry, all other, pro
posals doubtful. It is believed that
the campaign for the various pro
posals was not started early enough.
Harry E. Murray, vice-chairman of
the Republican central committee,
predicts ' that on Oahu alone Kuhio
will have a majority of 875 and that
in the fourth district the Republican
representatives and senators will all
be elected. In the fifth district, he
believes, the Republican candidates
will have a hard race, but with every
chance of being el acted.

POLISH KINGDOM REVIVED
WARSAW, Poland, Nov. 5 (delayed
in transmission). A manifesto of
Kaiser Wilhelm and Emperor rranz
Joseph of Austria was read today
(Sunday) and posted up, calling back
into existence the ancient kingdom of
Poland. The document was read - at
noon to Polish representatives In the
great .Warsaw palace by thp military
governor, Gen. von Be3eler, The
square was thronged with people and
a great demonstration ensued.
The quickest to realize the signifi
cance of the move were the students
who attended the ceremonies and they
at once incorporated Into units, raised
banners and paraded. There were
volunteers by the hundreds for the
Polish army, which the manifesto an
nounced would be called at once.
Gen. von Beseler, in the name of
Germany's sovereign, read the mani
festo and it was translated by the
palace commandant. Cheers resound
ed for the occasion and President
Brudzinski cf the city council gave
thanks, assertir.s the determination of
the Poles to be found worthy of the
liberties conferred. He also requested
the nomination of a regent to assume
the leadership of the new government,
