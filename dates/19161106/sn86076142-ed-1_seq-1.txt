Indications are apparent that a
tremendous vote will be cast through
out the state, according to political
leaders. Issues which seemed to
outline themselves most sharply on
the eve of the battle of ballots were
of course, Hughes and Wilson, wet or

United States senator. Headquarters
of the Prohibition forces predicted a
landslide for Amendment No. 2, re
structing "sale of liquor In public
drinking places and in retail stores,"
and a winning vote of five hundred
thousand for complete' prohibition,
according to a statement given out.
Both Republicans and Democrats
