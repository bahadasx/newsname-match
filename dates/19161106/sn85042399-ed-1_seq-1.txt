with an enthusiastic and appreciative
audience. Along the sides of the hall
nearly 100 Hughes pictures were ar
from front to rear,
and as the people passed out at the ; in any sense, of a high school or any
close of the meeting pictures of of the higher Institutions of learning.

district attorney; E. W. Wilson, can
didate for county sheriff; G. W.
Ager, candidate for county school su
perintendent; Myrtle W. Blakeley,
candidate for county treasurer; G. A.
Gardner, candidate for county clerk,
and J. B. Coleman, candidate for
county assessor.
The meeting was opened with the
singing of Holbrook Withington's
"Fairy Tales" by the Medford male
quartet composed of Messrs. Alford,
Colvig, Klrkpatrick and Osborne.
This brought continued applause and
the gentlemen responded with a
short encore. One by one the chair
man of the meeting called on the
candidates for speeches, and those for
the county offices each responded
briefly In the following order: G.
M. Roberts, for district attorney,
spoke of his belief that jitneys com
ing from adjoining states should be
under the same regulations as other
common carriers, which he thought
would prevent some liquor from com
ing Into the state unlawfully. He
stated that he hoped to render effi
cient service in the capacity of advis
er to the county court and the vari
ous county officers, and asked that
his record be looked up. J. B. Cole
man, for assessor, promised efficient
service with absolute equality of as
sessment as between the various dis
tricts of the county and between the
various property owners In each lo
cality. He requested that his past
record be investigated. G. A. Gard
ner, for county clerk, called attention
to the card Indexing, under his ad
ministration, of all documents on file
in his office. He stated that he has
systematized the accounting depart
ment of his office to such an extent
that he can tell in a few minutes just
what the operation of any county of
fice is costing and just how much
money has been spent in any road
district. He promised to continue the
same efficient service if elected.
Myrtle W. Blakeley, for county treas
urer, who has had much experience
as deputy in the treasurers office,
considered it a great honor to be a
candidate on the republican ticket.
She promised efficiency in the con
duct of her office, if elected, and
stated that all voting for her will
never have cause to regret her elec
tion. George W. Owen, for county
commissioner, said; "If you want
me for commissioner it is up to you
to give me your votes." This short
speech from the smiling countenance
of the big, strong, hearty man
brought a round of applause, during
which it was impossible to catch the
remainder of his talk. E. W. Wil
son, for county sheriff, who has been
the competent deputy for several
years, promised to conduct the office
in the present efficient manner. He
stated that he will strive to improve
the system and work of the office,
but does not want to put into prac
tice anything that does not mean real
economy for the taxpayers. G. W.
Ager, for county school superintend
ent, stated that he favors rural school
supervision and will fulfill his duties
in a proper manner.
Benj. C. Sheldon, for representa
tive, spoke at some length, principal
ly on the normal school question and
In hearty support of his two col
leagues, Gore and Thomas. He stat
ed that the normal campaign work
of two years ago and the educational
work throughout the state since that
time has brought the people of the
state to a fuller and more definite
realization of their needs in normal
schools. He spoke of the great good
done by the entertainment of the
in Medford a few weeks ago, visited
Ashland end Crater Lake and talked
normal school, more or less, all the
time. Of necessity the proper sphere
of a normal school is in its special
line of work and Immediate vicinity,
and It can not be classed as a rival,
sneiuon saiu mat me rtsuinuu ui-
mal school cause Is a live Issue, that
the outcome at Pendleton will have a
bearing on our own situation, and
that the Jackson, Josephine and
Douglas county candidates are plan
ning to work together and In har
mony for southern Oregon ;and Its
needs, not only for a normal school
but for proper protection of the fish
in Rogue river and the establishment
and building of more good roads
through securing our just proportion
of federal funds as well as for what-
ever other matters may arise of vital
Interest to the people or tnis section
of the state. Rogue river fishing,
said Mr. Sheldon, should be restored
as an industry. He called attention
to the fact that for many years the
state legislature has been controlled
by the republican party and that re
publican representatives therefore
have a much better opportunity than
those of any other party to secure
committee assignments,
need and to which we are justly en
titled.
In addition to the above, Mr. Shel-
don spoke of the high qualifications
of William H. Gore for representa-1
tive, of his long residence In this part
of the state, and of the advantage
bound to accrue to the people of
Jackson county In having at Salem a
strong man so long and intimately
identified with the pioneer life and
vital Interests of the county. Some- I
thing of the life and record or C. M.
Thomas, candidate for representa-1
tive, was delineated, showing Mr.
Thomas to be a man of high Integ-
important committee assignments, 1 the cJerk drew from gad i,os the
and that a solid republican delegation j nameg of 31 jurorg t0 serve at that
working In harmony at Salem wlllterni .,
stand the best show to secure for jn thfi geectIon of B jury to
southern Oregon the things that we I y the cage of gute vg Lorls Mar
Hty and accomplishments, fully ableiVan R0Uten, W. A. Stratton, J. O.
to be a worthy representative of his
constituents. He has been In Jackson
county about six years and has very
strong endorsements from his former
home in Iowa commending him for
his splendid work in that state with
Cummins.
C. M. Thomas spoke briefly, saying
In part that it Is a disgrace to the
state to have buildings and ground at
Ashland for a normal school and no
money with which to pay teachers.
He spoke of the work he has helped
to do In the Interest of the normal
school here and said: "I stand to
night ready to continue that work.
My opinions have undergone no
change, and it would be a pleasure to
stand with Sheldon and Gore to get
money enough to open the normal
school again." He also spoke of de
siring to assist in securing adequate
legislation for the proper protection
of Rogue river fishing. Gore and
Sheldon he commended as splendid
candidates.
William H. Gore talked a few min
utes in his usual entertaining and
convincing manner. He spoke of the
hopes of a solid delegation at work
for the Interests of this part of the
state, of several measures of most
vital Interest to us and of the high
qualifications of Candidates Sheldon
and Thomas. Mr. Gore Is regarded
as one of the sound and solid men of
Jackson county and his opinions
carry great weight.
Fred A. Mears of Medford was the
last speaker on the program. He
dwelt upon national issues and told
of the excellent record and ability of
Charles Evans Hughes, the republi
can candidate for president. Else
where In this Issue Is a brief review
of Mr. Mears' speech, which every
voter In Ashland, of whatever polltl-.
cal persuasion, should have heard. '

Dear Sir: Complying with your

term had been exhausted, the court
ma(je orders for the selection of spec-
la ven(res from said list of 200 Jur

To the Editor of the Ashland Tid
ings. In a recent Issue of the Ashland
Record I note a letter of B. C. Hub
bard, relative to the testimony In the
Martin case, of E. W. Wilson, deputy
sheriff and candidate for the repub
lican nomination for sheriff. Hav
ing been foreman of the Jury In the
Martin case and having heard all the
testimony at that trial, I desire to
state to the people of Jackson county
that the evidence given by Wilson
was no more material In the making
of our verdict than that given by oth
er witnesses.
I am in nowise Interested In Mr.
Wilson's campaign, but feel that Mr.
Hubbard's letter was published whol
ly for political purposes and to In
jure Mr. Wilson's candidacy for sher
iff. (Signed) GEORGE LYMAN,

$500 Watch To
Be Returned
"The spirit of the gift" Is an elu
sive, phantom thing which is seldom
tangible; but in the case of a gift
given to a cause by an Ashland wom
an, the spirit of the gift is turned
Into a living thing which is under
standable and which has worked big
things.
Some time ago President Hill of
the Great Northern railroad and cer
tain eastern Baptists agreed to give
$100,000 for the McMInnvllle Col
lege, the only Baptist college on the
coast, providing the coast BaptlBts
would raise $200,000. The amount
has been raised, churches everywhere
on the coast taking a big part.
In the course of the campaign for
funds the financial secretary of the
committee visited Ashland and called
on a woman member of the local
chu' ch among others. AVhile unable
torglve any money, this lady with
true spirit insisted upon giving a
valued gold watch to the cause. The
watch was accepted, and at a meet
ing of the state convention the story
was told of the giving of the watch
and $500 in $5 subscriptions given to
buy the watch, the money going to
the fund and the watch to be re
turned to its former owner. The
Medford church was appointed to re
turn the watch, and on next Sunday
afternoon at 3 o'clock a gathering
will be held in the local Baptist
church and the watch which raised
$500 returned to the Ashland lady
The gathering will also be in the na
ture of a jubilation over the success
ful raising of the college fund. Dr
Carstens of Medford will take charge
of the affair and Medford and local
musical talent will assist.
Councilman Lamb
Consents to Run
Councilman Lamb of the Third
ward has consented to be a candidate
for councilman from that ward, and
elsewhere announces his candidacy
Mr. Lamb was elected last fall to fill
out the unexpired term of Mr. Beigel
who died while in office. Mr. Lamb
has proven a conscientious council
man and a valuable man to the coun
cil because of his experience as a
contractor and businessman.
As soon as the smoke of battle has
cleared away after the national elec
tlon tomorrow, all Interest will be
'centered upon the race for the city
officershlps.
Only One Hunter
Killed for Deer
The 1916 deer season came to a
close last Tuesday. During the last
few days of the season hunters from
Ashland had remarkable BucceBS,
nearly every party which went out
bringing back venison. Had the
rainy weather arrived a few days
sooner even greater success would
have greeted the huntsmen, as the
long dry spell had made "still hunt
ing" impossible.
No fatal shootings occurred In
southern Oregon, and as far as we
are informed only one In the state,
that of Nate Ingraham, who was shot
and killed by Ray Hyde near McKln
ley, in Coos county.

audience with plnno selections, fol
lowing which Porter J. Neff gave a
clear and concise exposition of the

Claim Boys Stole
Barbwire Drink
Claiming that "Whlzzer" Cress and
another lad, . who were found last
Sunday in a state of Intoxication, bad
stolen the "barbwire" Whiskey from
him and that he had not giren tha
booze to the boys as Cress claimed,
Rob Roberts was acquitted in the re
corder's court last Monday. The tea.
tlmony of one of the boys upheld
Roberts to some extent and the evi
dence pointing toward conviction was
almost totally lacking.
