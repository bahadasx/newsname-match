HUGHES ASSERTS
HIS CONFIDENCE
OF VICTORY ON
EVE OF ELECTION
Republican Nominee Spends
Day Recuperating From
Labors of Hard Campaign;
Thanks Workers
WILLCOX PREDICTS 100
ELECTORAL MAJORITY
Wilson Feels Sure He'll Win;
McCormick Claims Practi
cally All of Electoral
Votes; Fair Weather Fore
casted.
New York, "Nov. 6. President
Woodrow Wilson and Charles E.
Hughes, candidates of the dominant
parties for President, remained quietly
at their homes to-day recuperating
from the labors of the long campaign.
The last word sent forward by them
to the people was an expression that
each felt confident of victory.
President Wilson planned to remain
at home to-day and his only activity
to-morrow will be a trip to Princeton
to cast his ballot. To-morrow night
with only the members of his family
about him, he will receive the return#
in his study at Shadow Lawn.
Mr. Hughes remained at his hotel
early in the forenoon but later visited
the national Republican headquarters
chiefly, it was stated, to thank the
workers there for their efforts in his
behalf. He intended to take a drive
through the parks this afternoon and
spend the rest of the day at his hotel.
To-morrow he will vote in his home
district here and to-morrow night he
will get the returns in his hotel rooms.
Like Mr. Wilson, he plans to have
only immediate members of his fam
ily with him when the returns come.
Headquarters Still Active
Political headquarters here still pre
sented scenes of activity to-dav. Last
reports from the political battlefield
were received and final instructions
sent. Both the chairmen had little to
add to their forecasts issued Saturday
night. Republican Chairman Willcox
then predicted Hughes would receive
at least 100 majority in the electoral
college, while Democratic Chairman
McCormick gave Mr. Wilson 364 votes
In that body. The necessary elective
vote in the college is 266.
The larger participation of women
as voters in a presidential campaign
and the congressional election are of
keen interest to politicians generally.
The returns from the States in which
women will vote, it is admitted, will
be closely and anxiously scanned.
So far as Congress is concerned, a
full House of Representatives and
thirty-three United States Senators
will be elected. The total membership
of the House is 435 and the necessarv
majority is 218. In the Senate the
present membership is 96 and the
necessary majority is 49. In all, 3 5
new Senators will take their seats next
March. Of these, the Republicans
elected two at the September election
in Maine. Forty-two of the States will
elect State officers to-morrow, in ad
dition to national congressional candi
dates. Of these States, thirty-five will
elect Governors.
Fair weather and moderate tem
perature is forecast generally for elec

12 AMERICANS ARE
REPORTED KILLED
BY VILLA BANDITS
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 6.—Twelve American citizens have been
killed by Villistas in their raids on towns south of Chihuahua,
according to information received by federal agents here to-day. *
These include nine Americans at
Parral, Dr. C. H. Fisher, stabbed to
death at Santa Rosalia, and Harry
Bec'neimer and Dr. Frank Well, killed
at Guerrero.
Hope for the safety of the nine
Americans known to have been in Par
ral faded to-day when it was learned
that they attempted to flee from the
town in a party by themselves instead
of joining the Carranza force of Gen
eral Luis Herrera and going to Es
calon.
It is reported here that General
Pershing is preparing to move east
ward and take a hand against the Vil
listas if the reports of the killing of
the Americans is confirmed. At Fort
Bliss it was said there was no informa
tion to give out. It was intimated,
however, that such co-operation had
been asked by the de facto govern
ment.

Bishop Philip R. McDevitt Urges
Citizens To Pass High School Loan
"As I have recently come to Ilarrisburg, I hesitate to ex
press any views upon matters of public interest in the city.
"From the daily press I have learned of the agitation for
greater high school facilities. I should think that, once this
need is demonstrated, there- can be but one opinion for either
a new or an old resident, and that is—the city should fulfill its
duty to provide school accommodations for those who desire
an education beyond the elementary grades. The oidy excuse
for putting aside of this duty is the total inability of the city to
meet the necessary financial outlay. Very likely few citizens
will acknowledge that the city cannot assume the burden,
especially as it is characteristic of all progressive communities
to make sacrifices, if necessary, for education.
PHILIP R. McDEVITT,
Bishop of the Ilarrisburg Catholic Diocese.
WEST SHORE HIGH
SCHOOL LOAN HAS
FAVOR OF VOTERS
People Understand "That It
Will Improve Conditions
and Won't Be Costly
The West Shore central high school
It is believed, will be approved by all
of the communities which will vote
upon it to-morrow.
This good news was brought to
Harrisburg this morning by represen
tatives of Camp Hill, Lemoyne,
Wormleysburg, West Fairview, Enola,
Washington Heights and East Penns
boro township in general, who had
devoted Saturday afternoon and Satur
day night to working among the
voters. *
When the loan was first proposed
many people were against it because
they feared it would mean a big in
crease in taxes, but now it has been
shown iliat it will not only cost less to
operate one central high school than
to have a high school for each com
munity, but the result will be a high
school equal lo that of a large city
and it is believed the whole West
Shore will be built up rapidly as a re
sult.
Failure of Ix>an Would Be CosUy j

Will Investigate Alleged
Conspiracy to Boost Coal
New York. Nov. 6. An alleged
conspiracy in this city to raise the
price of coal will be under the investi
gation of both th'e Kings and Queens
counties district attorneys before the
end of the week, it was declared to
day. Evidence bearing on the sub
ject secured by agents of the Depart
ment of Justice, indicate, it was said,
that the alleged manipulation was in
New York only and disclosed through
the demand upon retailers for extra
ordinary high prices by operators who
had coal in storage within the State.
Hall, a flagman, and Oliver Baum
gardner, brakeman, were In the
caboose, but kept tlieir seats and were
not hurt, while the fireman leaped
from the train at Muleshoe curve and
escaped with slight injuries.
The four engines were standing at
New Portage Junction and directly in
the path of the onrushing freight.
There was nothing to stop the run
away, and before the men on the en
gines were aware, the impact came.
Forty-seven of the loaded coal cars
followed the engine in its mad plunge
and were reduced to a mass of twisted
steel. A few minutes later fire broke
out in the coal, and firemen were hur
ried from neighboring towns.

Mexico City, Nov. fi. The Mex

the British ambassador at Washington
of the presence of German submarines
in the Gulf of Mexico and has been
warnert that the allies will tako
"drastic, measures" if the undersea t
craft receive aid from Mexican ports
or source. This information was
made public last night by Foreign
Minister Aguilar who Issued the text
of the note received from the British
ambassador through United States
Secretary of State Lansing and Charge
D'Affaires Charles B. Parker.
The British note demands a strict
censorship of the Mexican wireless and
says that any failure to maintain
Mexican neutrality will be attended
by disastrous results. In his reply,
addressed to Mr. Parker, Senor Aguilar
says that it seems strange to the '
Mexican government that Great
Britain should use the United States
department as an intermediary on a
point concerning Mexico alone, es
pecially when Great Britain has an
accredited representative to Mexico.
The reply says that the Mexican gov
ernment will, for this time only, an
