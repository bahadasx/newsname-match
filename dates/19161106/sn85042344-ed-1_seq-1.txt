nominees of five parties. Democratic, Republican, Socialist,
Prohibition and Progressive. First on the list are the ten
presidential electors. Directly underneath are the names of
the candidates for justice of the supreme court, judge of the

It Is a popular opinion that a trorn,

Men are Inclined to overlook many

need It, hi- says.
About one-third of the teachers In
tho county schools are men. Their
compensation Is about the same as

Tulsa county tr.ichers are betle.r

election official, should know what to do in an event of this
kind, for it is essential that every voter be given tho sacred

his vote, printed ballots or no printed ballots! Head the
