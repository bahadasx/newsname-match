COAL AND FOPO
PRICE PLOT SEEN
Aleged Fuel, Bread and Milk
Conspirators Face
Prosecution.
Criminal prosecution of persons believed
guilty of illegal practices in forcing up
the price of coal, bread and milk, will be
brought by the Department of Justice
within the next few weeks, it was an
nounced by the Attorney General yester
day.
"Wherever increase in the price of these
commodities has been due to conspiracy
4 other unlawful action, the department
Wil invoke against the offenders the
severest penalties which the law pre
scribe," said the statement.
The Department of JUstice, It was de
rlared. has already Initiated three sepa
late Investigations Into the causes for
existing high prices of various commodi
ties, and it was rumored in offcial quar
ters yesterday that agents of the depart
ment have uncovered evidence which
tends to show a conspiracy on the part
of coal operators and coal carrying rail
roads to force up the price of fuel.
In substantiation of this belief It was
pointed out that weather conditions havo
been excellent. so there could be no
shortagze of coal cars due to a blockade.
The railroaids contend they cannot handle
the coal output of the mines on account
of the car shortage, but at both the De
partment of Justice and the Interstate
Commerce Commission it was declared an
condition exists which would cause a
-mttral shortage of cars.
Whole Couatry suffem
In further support of the charge that
conspiracy "sats, it was said that all
.ections of the country are sufferitg
equally. although there would be fo
s use for distant points lo be affecte@
-riously. because long hauls are Ii.
vored. If the allegation of a real car
-hortage was true, It was declared, only
lPose places immediately affected, which
pould be the shorter hauls, would suffer.
e id thet for only a short time.
From all parts of the country com
I-laints have been received by the Depart
meOt of Justice. and considerable data
have been gathered bearing on the situa
tioru. both from private persons and
trom district attorneys.
What the Department of Justice must
prove. to establish Its case, is a con
rpiracy for restraint of traffc on the part
of the railroads; a conspiracy to reduce
production for the purpose of Increas
ing the price of coal on the part of the
operators, and, going to the bottom, a
conspiracy to withhold coal from the
market for the purpose of raising the
price on the part of the middlemen.
The principal Federal inquiry into the
high price of milk centers at Boston, al
though investigaemn are Uney In
New York. ieadetmia, W fI and
cther cities.
The Inquiry tl ead prices, includ
ing the wheat centers In Chi

Germany and Austria Proclqim
It Hereditary Monarchy.
(By the Iaternatioall News Servle,)
Berlin (via Sayville), Nov. 5.-Poland,
rich in romance,-of storied interest almost
unparalleled in fascination, was rezru
ated today.
Proclamations re-establishing the right
of the Polish nation to control its own
destinies were read at Warsaw and at
Lublin. General Von Beseler officiated
at Warsaw and General Kuk at Lublin.
The event, marking one of the greatest
moments in the life of Europe. was con
summated by joint action of the German
'Emperor and the Emperor of Austria.
The form of government established by
the proclamation is described as an au
tonomous hereditary monarchy. In effect
it extends to the Polish provinces occu
pied by the central powers, with respect
to city administration, rights of self
government similar to those enjoyed by
the city of Warsaw since early in le
war.
The exact delineation of the frontiers
of the revived kingdom is left to the
future, as is the question of who shall
be placed upon the throne of the new
kingdom. A Polish assembly is to be
created.
General von Beseler, who while military
governor of Belgium earned warm com
mendation from the American relief ad
ministrators by his practical sagacity, will
for the present exercise chief authority.
The ancient kingdom of Poland. whose
splendor was the glory of four centuriwa,

Millions have been killed and 0O0 han

Takes FirstReal Rest in Last

(my the isitessaw News Serrsee)
New York, Nov. 5.-Probably the most
serenely confident man, politically. In NeI
York today was Charles Evans Hughes.
On the ground that he had said his last
say at the Madison Square Gyden dem
onstration Saturday night, the Republican
Presidential candidate declined' to make
any statements. He talked freely with
bia friends, however, and was in bettfr
shape, physically, in better spirits; and
had a more definite view of the result of
Tuesday's election than at any time since
the opening of his campaign.
To the correspondents who had made
the long coast-to-coast journey with hin
he practically remarked this atmosphere
of confidence and victory which perme
ated the Hughes private apartments In
the Hotel Astor.
Hughes absolutely believes he will be
elected President Tuesday.
When the candidate awoke at 10 O'clock
this morning with nothing to do for the
first time since last June, actually twenty
one weeks had elapsed since a similar
awakening the day following his nomina
tion-except that he then had all the labor
of the campaign ahead of him. In rhe
interveningperiod the candidate declared
today, the issues have unfolded In pra
cisely the same manner which he '%ad
hoped for, right down to last night's dem
onatration in his home -State, which
Eughes considers the climax of the entire
campaign, and the point where the rest
can be left in the hands of the voters.
His work done, he will now quietly
await the action of the voters Tuesday.
Tonight, the candidate and Mrs. Hughes
spent with their grandchildren.
Tuesday he will vote in a laundry in
Eighth avenue near Forty-fifth street,
and In the evening, with his family. and
no one else, around him, he will-receltd
the returns in his private apartments in
the Astor, into which two telegraph wires
have been strung.

Elines'at of Doubt Makes the
Struggle Most Amazing
for Thirty Years.

Impartial Observers Are Fearful of
Makisa Any Positive
Predictions.
(By the Inteseaia-ma News sesviea.)
New York, Nov. S.-Thirty-esi
hours before the dawn of election day
impartial political observers are
agreed that the element of doubt
makes this the most amazing Presi
dential battle in the last thirty years.
Both National Committee chairmen
are sincere when tiey put forth their
claims of party success. Both are
prepared foi surprises.
The Republican managers claim As
Eastern States with a con6dence that
seems to be a shade stronger than
that expressed by their Democratic
neighbors.
So far as the Central Western
States are concerned, the conditions
are reversed.
Claim New lork by 40,0".
The rock bottom figures of the Demo
cratic National Committee give Wilsam a
majority in New York State slightly Was
than 40.000.
The Democrats look for a decded slump
in the Republican majorities above the
Bronx and for an averace majority beiw
that political stream.
The Republicans are very connldcnt .f
their ability to carry New York State.
They are uilling to concede a shrinkage
up the State. but assert It will not be
material. Where they expect to make an
emphatic gain are in the boroughs of
K~ps and Queens in this city.
Although both committee. claim New
Jersey. impartial political obeervers are
inclined to give the President's State to
the New York judge
glummig up the national eftuation. two
distinctive views were exiressed toda.y
by the real leaders of thought !a the
renective parties.
