Washington, Nov. 6 The American
government has informed the de facto
government of.. Mexico that precau
tion should be taken to prevent any
violation of Mexico's neutrality by op
eration..; df- a belMgerent submarines
within its territorial -waters or the es
tablishment of a submarine base on
the Mexican coast. . . :;. 1 . -'
The information was conveyed; a
t nffiela.1 said todav.'
In a. i wholly friendly spirit and not at
the suggestion of any of the entente
powers. The state department officials
realized U that if Germany began
widespread. campaign 5 of commerce
raiding as was believed possible '.at tlie
time of the submarine aj$ack off 'the
New England coast, it might be ex
tended tb Mexico. The great oil fields
there, the principal, source of fuel oil'
for British war vessels, it was thought
might attract German submarines. ,.
It was said today the Mexican gov
ernment is without sufficient means .to
insure protection of its neutrality and
that it might bev comparatively easy
for a foreign power to establish a sub
marine base at some point along the
coast. -:vv v -;
1 Serious complications between Mex
ico and Great Britain or France might
ensue, to the embarassment of the
government -which -might bring the
"United States into the controversy.
I Denial was made at the department
that any protest had' been submitted
to Mexico City for Sir Cecil Spring
Iioce,'the British ambassador here.
Mexico City, Nov. 6 The Mexican
government has been notified by the
British ambassador at Washington
that the presence of German subma
rines in the Gulf of Mexico and has
been warned that the allies will take
"drastic measures" if the undersea
craft receive aid from Mexican ports
or sources. ' This v information was
made public last , night by . Foreign
Minister - Aguilar who issued the text
of a note, said to have been received
of the British Embassador through
United States Secretary of State Lan
sing and Charge d' Affaires Charles B.
Parker- .-. -:;.;'' -
"jThe British note demands a'. strict
censorship of the ' Mexican wireless
aand says that any failure to" maintain
Mexican neutrality will be attended by
disastrous results. ' . In his reply, ad
dressed to Mr.; Parker, Seno Aguilar
says that-it seems strange to the Mex
ican government that Great -Britain
should use the United States State De
parment as an intermediary on a point
concerning Mexico alone, especially
when Great Britain has an accredited
representative to Mexico. The reply
says that the Mexican government
will for this time only answer the re
presentations of the - British govern
ment through Mr.' Parker. , ' -

G. 0. P. BOSSES, DESPERATE AT
PROSPECT OF WILSON SWEEP,
TO STRIVE TO SAVE ALDERMEN
John T. King's Republican machine
in Bridgeport, .once well-oiled and
smooth running, is about ready for
the junk pile. District mechanicians
have borne this sad tidings to .Mr.
King, following their ' house-to-house
canvass of the city.
While the machine may stagger
along until 5 o'clock tomorrow after
noon, the report tb the big chief says,
it will go to pieces like" the- "ofe one
hoss shay" when the verdict comes
in from the polls.' The machine, tem
porarily patched up, is , running on
one cylinder now the hope N of sav-r
ing a few Republican aldermen from
the wreckage.
' The house-to-house canvass, just
completed by the G. O. P. workers,
brought in a verdict that has caused
Mr. King and his advisers to abandon
hope of giving a majority to the Re
publican state and national tickets
here.. J The overwhelming sentiment
for President Wilstm, Judge Beardsley
and Homer S. Cumhaings left no doubt
as to what Bridgeport will do tomor

A CARNIVAL HERE
Teh Persons Keport' Pockets
Picked By Some of
Colonel's Train.
Theodore Roosevelt had some fol
lowers dn this city - Saturday night,
coming here with him from the Mid
dle West, whom1 the Colonel no doubt
would . repudiate, in terms character
istic , of the ' man, were ' he aware of
their activities.
Incidentally the. police, of thfs city
would like very much to interview the
followers," as the authorities term
them, because of the fact thi.t they
left this city with innumerable pocket-
books, bill folds and 'monies, which
they deftly extracted from the pockets
of the crowd who jammed Main street
in front of the armory, where the Col
onel spoke Saturday night.
Ten men . yesterday and today have
reported they were victims cf pick?
pockets, and others are expected to-'be
heard from hourly. Harry Wa rren, of
289 East avenue, lost $11; David Sied
ler, 6 . Highland avenue, missed $145;
John A. Sundkist, 101 Davidson street.
a wallet containing $75 and valuable
papers; C. W. Scarrett, 235 Shelton
street, $21; Walter Cavil, 307 Ogden
street, and F. H. Johnson, 215 Capitol
avenue, lost $5 each; Charles Jones,
745 Broad street, $59; C. E. Liang, 80
John ereet, missed' a pocketbook con
taining money and papers; James S.
Penwell, 73 Prospect street, a bill fold
containing $15. !
The ipolice chased two gangs of New
Tork pickpockets, three in one band
and four In another, when they aligh-
ed from the trains at the station Sat
urday afternoon. They . scattered and
escaped, however, in Main street by
boarding jitneys.
Lieut. E. O. Cronan says he believes
the gang who operated successfully in
front of the armory are from the
West, coming here with Roosevelt, as
Detective Serweant McCluskey of New
York stood in front of the armory and
failed to see a single New York crook
in the crowd. ; '
Lawrence Destore, of 258 Grand
street, 21 year's of age, a munitions
worker, was arrested' on suspicion,
several persons claiming they saw
him feeling the pockets of men in the
crowd. His case was continued until
Wednesday; In the city court this
morning, 'bonds, being fixed at $200.
Seek Record Here of
Alleged Safe Cracker
! To learn about the previous record
of Henry Ogden, alias Jimmy Oliver,
a notorious safe cracker, government
officials today appealed to Clerk Havi
land of - the superior court for In
formation. ' Upon Investigation it was
found that Ogden had been sentenced
in the criminal superior court in this
city in 1900 for a 10 year term in
state'9 prison.
He anid' Jimmy Murphy wereN ar
rested at that time for assault with
Intent to murder George , Morris, a
watchman at a local brewery. Ogden
was released from prison in 1908, and
since then he has been keeping secret
service men busy. He has been sus
pected of robbing several postofflces
but nothing could be proved against
him.
Last week secret service men ar
rested him on a' New York ferryboat
on. the charge that he was - carrying
concealed weapons. ' As he could fe
ceive only a light sentence for this the
police' wanted- proof of his criminal
record in this state as the punish

ing their own polls a fair Indicator,
have turned their attention to trying
to save a few Republican aldermen.
Orders went out yesterday to. this
effect: "Save the aldermen. We may
be licked . good and plenty, so far as
the state and national candidates are
concerned, but we ought to save the
Common Council."
That's the situation today. In every
district, paid Republican workers are
sounding the "S. O. S." in behalf of
the aldermen.
Here's the way the bosses figure it:
"Supposing Mr. Wilson and Judge
Beardsley do carry the city, and the
state and nation, a month from .today,
that will not mean a thing in our
young lives. But, supposing we lose
prospective ' Warrenite contracts; supV
posing we lose prospective enlarge
ments of the police and fire depart
ments; supposing we lose the rest
of the gravy that goes with the control
of the Common Council.
"That's something else . again, "men.
"Tell with everything else.
"Save the aldermen.
"Save the gravy."
