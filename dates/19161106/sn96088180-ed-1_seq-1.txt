Washington, Nov. (, The United
States can not recognise Poland aa
an Independent nation before the con
clusion of peace, It was announced
at the state department today. Re
gardless of the reported aotton of the
central powers In proclaiming Poland
a free and Independent kingdom, her
tatui, from the standpoint of the
United States, Is still "captured ter
ritory" and her future position must
tie settled by the peace negotiations.
Washington, Nov. JS.The United
States supreme court jtoduy agreed to
review the Oiegon-Csllfornln land
case, Involving millions of dollars'
worth of land granted by the govern
ment to railroads In the two slates.
The lands have been in litigation
for years congress at its last session
passed a law ordering the sale of the
land, the railroads to get 12.50 an
acre, the original sale price to settlers
under the grant.
Tha case went back to the courts
and the department of Justice peti
tioned the court to review the whole
case on Ita merits.
The court waa asked to determine
whether lower court decrees banded
down before congress passed Its a
and ordering the disposal of the
lands, were in conformity with a
former decree of the supreme court.
The court, In bringing up the case
again, granted a motion to advance
hearing, , The case was put on the
calendar for February 26.
NEUTRALITY OF: .
MEXICO SOUGHT
Mexico .City," Nov., . Forel in
Minister Aguilar replied to England's
demands that Mexican neutrality be
rigorously enforced as regarda the
German submarine believed to be
operating In territorial waters of the
southern republic.
The British note, sent through Sec
retary Unslng, and warning against
aid or assistance being afforded the
Teuton submarine, created strongly
unfavorable feeling, which expressed
Itseir In Agullar's reply.
The Carransa foreign minister first
pointed out that he failed to see why
the Brlthth note should have been
sent through the United Statea depart
ment of stste Instead of direct to the
Mexican foreign office. He declared
Mexican neutrality would be en
forced, but pointed out that Mexico
could no mora be held responsible for
German submarine operations off her
coasts than could the United 8tatea
be held responsible for the. recent
activities of the U-53 oft Nantucket
after that undersea fighter had en
tered an American port.
The reply, with thinly veiled gar
canm, suggested that the beat way to
assure continued friendly relations
between the two governments is for
'the British fleet to prevent German
submarines from leaving their banes,
thus eliminating any rbsnce for dis
agreements, i
The Carransa foreign office, Aguilar
declares, will, however, permit no
violation of Its neutrality by any
warships of the belligerent nations,
Washington, Nov. I. The elate
department notified the Mexican gov
ernment some days ago that the allies
feared the establishment of a Ger
man naval base on her coast, It was
lesrned today. .
This action waa not taken upon any
request from the allied governments
and no speolflo request or recommen
dation was made. The fact was that
It waa merely transmitted for the in
formation of that government, It was
said. "

Isdiasa, the "Balance of Power" States
New York, Nov. f. Tomorrow
the American voter aays who will be
the next president of the United
Btatea, dictates who will compose the
senate and chooses members of the
house of representatives.
Viewing the situation today, 24
hours In advance of the battle of the
ballots, and with claims from both
democrats and republicans cocksure
of victory, It appeared that New otk.
Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana would
come the nearest to holding the bal
ance of power. Both aldea claim this
"big four" or states. Their total In
the electorlal college la 113 nearly
4S per cent of the 266 votea necessary
to a choice.
The strictest neutral or even the
strongeat republican, for that matter
concedes the democrats the "solid
south" block of 126 votea. This
121 comprises the electoral votes of
Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana. Texas. Arkan
sas', Tennessee and Oklahoma.
It does not Include Kentucky and
Missouri, heretofore classified as com
ponent parts of the solid south, and
this year claimed by democrats still
to be In that section, but adjudged
by republicans to "be debatable
ground.
In the presidential race, therefore.
Republican Candidate Hughes starts
off with his opponent given a handi
cap of 136 votes. But he also has
been granted by the democrat a han
dicap from scratch of 70 votes the
electoral total of six states; Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Is
land. Pennaylvanla and Iowa. ,
That leavea Wilson with a net han
dicap In the vote rare of 66 spares In
the electorlal college.
But unless there Is a cataclysm In
the voting, the neutrals admit that
the 113 votes of the "big four" states
will be real turning points In the
election; The democrats claimed all
four today; so did the republicans.
In Illinois lies the real' enigma
close to 800,000 new women voters.
Because they are new In their exer

SLAIN BY BANDITS
AT SANTA ROSALIA
' El Paso, Nov. 6. Every energy of
the United States state department is
being directed today toward obtain
ing information as to the safety of 10
Americans known to be In Parral, and
apprehension was aroused to fever
heat upon the arrival last night of
four Americans, who fled from Chi
huahua bringing further reports of
the murder of Dr. C. H. Fisher, aged
American. In Santa Rosalia? by VII
llsta bandits. ": ' " ! 1 '
After hunting down and killing Dr.
Fisher, the bandits told the Inhabi
tants of the- town they were "going
to Parral and Mil those gringoes,"
natives reaching Chihuahua City after
the raid told the refugees. In offi
cial quarters here hope is held out
that the Americans were able to es
cape before the bandits reached Par
ral. Representatives of mining com
panies employing some of the men
declare their belief that the men are
safe, but admit their anxiety has been
aroused by the lack of news. v In a
message to the United Press, General
Trevlno, commander of the Mexican
de facto garrison at Chihuahua City,
atated he was unable to obtain any
news of the fate of the American.
Communication still cut off. was the
word from Trevlno, "and have no
Information from Parral. Making
efforts to) get news."
On the name train bringing" the
American refugees last Bight were
the families of two staff officers of
Trevfno's army and the family of
seven French residents of the Chi
huahua capital reaving there In tear
that Villa will next attack that city.
They crossed to the American side
of the river. . Every foreigner com
ing out predicts that the city will be
evacuated if Villa makes another at
tack. W. E. Phillips, secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. of Chihuahua City, waa
one of the refugees.. . ,
."It Is almost, certain Fisher. was
killed," he said. "A well known na
tive cattleman, who came overland
from Santa Rosalia, declared that the
doctor hid when the bandits entered
the town. Upon orders of the Vtllista
commander he was hunted down and
stabbed to death. '
"In Chihuahua CKr it ia believed
Parral Is In possession of Villa, but
we heard nothing of the fate of the
Americans." said Dr. Phillips. '
Other refugees said that artillery
on the hills back of Chihuahua City
had been hauled down yesterday and
loaded upon flat cars. Thia waa taken
as an indication that evacuation waa
Imminent.' ,
That another American waa mur
dered In Santa Rosalia waa the state
ment of Dr. W. V. Jackson, of El
Paso last flight. He declared that an
Influential Mexican who arrived here
'brought Information that Harry j
Brenshan, mining prospector, waa
caught by bandits after Fisher's mur
der and shot to death. Dr. Jackson
said the report had been brought In
by a messenger sent to Santa Rosalia
by his Informant after the raid, but
would not divulge his name.
