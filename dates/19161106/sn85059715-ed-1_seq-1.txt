Charles A. Sutton
Is a Sore Winner
+ ^ ^ *
Charles A- Sutton, nominee of the
t Republican party for Judge cf the
criminal court. Is another of the certain
-winners at tomorrow's election.)
Mr. Sutton in campaigning through-1
out the county has made his posi-i
rion clear. With every other pood J
citizen he feels the office of judge is j
in no sense a political office. Under i
our laws, however, political parties,1
nominate candidates for such offices.j
Mr. Sutton, being the candidate 'of!
the Republicans, expects and will re-j
ceive the united support of that party, j
, Being a young man of clean record :
i from his earliest boyhood, he will|
doubtless receive many votes from
other parties. His conception of the;
high office which he seeks is such.
! however, that he will discharge the
duties of judge without regard to;
I partisanship and directed only by the
high sense of justice* and right that
an untarnished conescience and an
unspotted Integrity will Indicate.
He is no untried youngster. He
has served the people faithfully In
the legislature. He has acted with
_v??! .. sMMsor. He has
UUlllL.* ?
practiced law for several jwars with
marked success. His friends urge his
election with the fullest confidence
in his ability and Integrity. He will
make a good judge.

afternoon. Tomorrow he will vote
in his home district here and tomorrow
night he will get the returns in

he plans to have only immediate
members of his family with him when
the returns come.
Political headquarters here still presented
scenes of activity today. Last
reports from the political battlefields
were received and final instructions
sent. Both chairmen had little to
add to their forecasts issued Saturday
night. Republican Chairman Willcox
then predicted Hughes would receive
at least 300 majority In the electoral
college while Democratic Chairman
McCormick gave Mr. Wilson 364 votes
in that body. The necessary elective
vote in the college is 266.
The larger participation of women

present membership is ninety-six and

CHARLESTON. Nov. 6?Today
marks the close of one of the most
notable political campaigns In the
history of West Virginia. It has not
been as spectacular as that involving
the prohibition question, but has
been as vigorously contested. The
Republicans have made their campaign
mainly on the fundamental
'principles of their party, together
with the claim that their administration
of the affairs of the state have
been progressive, aggressive and yet
cheap to the tax payers. The Democrats
during the last two months of
the campaign have not based their
claims for preference so much upon
the accomplishments of the national
< administration as on an anti-state administration
platform.
