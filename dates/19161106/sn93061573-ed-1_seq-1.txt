In Iho possession of Lod Cash,' un
eraheriff of Untoo Couuly, If an
Moctuion issued by :' Judge ' King
óom against J. F.- Brsnso'ri,' le$
Moines business man, ondth fl
ptblican candidate for ' Bcnalor
whom tbe voters ol Union are re
quested to vote foK Tuesday,' Tbe
execution is for the- insignificant
uro of Ave dollars and is in favor
of Fifer Caudle, to whom tbe small
sum has been due for a Ion? time,
for labor performed in repairing a
gasoline engine. The execution was
issued tbe latter part of the week
and will be served this week.
Mr. Caudle, in explaining the suit,
writes the following letter:
"This is my llrst experience with
Mr. Branson.. I was looking for a
location for a stock of general mer
chandise and I stopped at Des Moin
es. I met Mr. Branson and he bought
Hie stock at 50 and 60 per cent on the
dollar. I went back and' boxed 'the
Mock and loaded it for Dcs Moines.
After' I got it in transit I received
n letter from hiiri saying he' would
not take it so I had to go to Des
Voini'S and wait for the goods to
arrive there' and while Waiting
there 'Mr.' Branson was running a
bean thresher or cleaner and. his en
nine was bothering him consider
ably, so I told him I would fix it
for five dollars. He worked at it
for some time afterward and then he
told me to fix it. I went to work
at it and after almost all one half
day, got it all right. Then Mr.
Branson refused to pay ine what we
agreed on and he still owes it yet
today. 1 '
"Now I am a Republican by prin
iple and always have voted the
kiokct, but Mr. Voter, can we sup
port a man who won't stick to his
word and pulls off such childish
eieals as he has, I believe he will
fo the same at the expense of the
ounty should he be elected. I have
found his promise - to be no good.'
"Every word of this is the truth
and if it is not Mr. Branson has a
recourse at me. But watch for it,
I am able to prove every word."
Vifer Caudle.
A "FACT THAT WAS NOT MEN
, . TIONED ,, .
ATTORNEY HAD NO TIME.
Nick Vallis, the young Spanish
American, who suffered a broken
aose from the fist of Bud McGUtre,
He ' marshal of Van Houten, last
Saturday appeared before District
Attorney George Ficroley with his
omplaint Young Vallis reports that
Mr. Remley advised him that ho was
foo busy to look after the case;
that heo ould not' take care of all
these miners; that if Vallis went
ahead and made a complaint that
he (Remley) would lake care of the
esse if he found time. Perhaps
Mr. Remley is very busy, but pray
tell us where could his assistant,
Oria L. Phillips, be at this time that
he could not have looked after this
case of assault Phillips is out cam
paifruinq; but be 8 drawing a salary
from Uie taxQaycvs at tho samo
Moje. ' Of course a caso wherein a
aal ramp bull smashes a man's
nose is of very lUIe importance,
and should bo passed without no
tice. , M
Wilson has kept us out of unneces
ary war, and tbe Republican cam
paign, as made by both Roosevelt
and Hughes, has threatened changes
of policy containing very definite
dangers of war.

IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE OF
.REPUBLICAN SHEET LEADS TO.
'-lanLbisu misstatement "
In the recent, and somewhat de
layed pre-election issue of tho re
publican organ appears a lengthy
and, needless to say, inaccurate at
tack upon J. W. Thompson, the
democratic candidate for the office
of County Superintendent of Schools
in wbhich the following childish mis
statement - is made- with the - hope
that Thompson's candidacy for the
office may in some manner be in
jured. '!': ''
In referring to the report whoch
Thompson,1 as superintendent of the
Clayton school, made to tho State
Superintendent the Geyser spouts
this "We also give the line in the
report following this one,' and his
answer ig a 'Honey Lou', to say the
least. Here it is; 'Data of expiration
of present valid' New Mexico cer
tificate.' 'Professional". Surely our
readers - and all tho voters would
like to know how to manufacture a
DATE out of tho word PROFES
SIONAL." Such is the stuff the Republicans
are using in their efforts to dis
credit 4he Democratic candidates.
We ace not greatly surprised at
the ignorance of the writer of that
artielie, but wea re greatly surprised
that such a childish misstatement
should pass the notice of the man
the Republicans would have you be
lieve is well posted in educational
affairs and an expert in the know
ledge and workings of the educat
ional system of the slate.
Were the opponent of Thompson,
and the dope artist of our contem
porary as well posted in the edu
cational system of the slate as they
would have the" voter's : believe,
they would know that a Professional
Life certificate has no date of ex
piration, except death of the holder.
Mr. (Thopson's opponent- who
may or may not have even a first
grade certificate, should have known
at least that much, even tho
the political writer of the Geyser
is excusable for his ignorance In
such matters.
M. Hughes plays for the voles of
women. When Governor he vetoed
a bill to give women teachers sal
aries equal to those paid the other
sex; later ho failed to volo when
lha sufTrago issue was before the
people of his own state.

"I am more than ever convinced,"
says the writer of a letter being gen
erally circulated among the women
of the state, that the only
hope of suffrage for the women of
New Mexico is found in the atti
tude of the Republican party and
the Republican candidates in our
favor."
We presume, and baso the as
sumption upon tho fact that her
profession demands some insight in
to tho affairs of the state, that
Dr. Jesse A. Russel, tho writer of
the letter is sincere in her belief.
We are willing to grant that she
is within her province in taking
every opportunity to advance the
cause of equal suffrage.
Yet with all the courtesy duo a
lady politican,we take off our hat
and state gently, yet firmly, "Madam
you're not even in the right church'
If get that if the Republican
party and tho Republican candidates
aro the only hopo of suffrage, why
in the namo of common sense did
not tho same Republican bosses
who are backing tho lady doctor
include equal suffrage in the con
stitution they wrote and foisted up
on the state but a few short years
ago, instead of making the hope
of equal suffrage almost a despair
by their clever three fourths maj
ority clause in that document
Us men were ever the gay deceiv
ers, dear lady doc, and in this in
stance wo feel sure that somo gen
tleman friend is stringing you.
Just as Charlio Hughes, the hor
rid wretch, is stringing the women
of tho nation.

was net mentioned favorably in the

His friends doubt that' Mr. Vigil ;

bt the only excuse for leaving hi j

clined to believe the slight was in- !

the rumored 'trading' of their pro

democratic candidato for sheriff.
Mr. Vigil is a fair minded man,

PHILLIPS nAS FAILED TO EX
PLAIN During the past month the'
porter has published the record la
four different cases on the oourt
record books of Colfax county. These
records show beyond doubt that Orie
L. Phillips, now Assistant District
attorney, and at present candidal
for district attorney on the Repub

a lawyer for big corporations ani
rich individuals of ths county ia
suits against Colfax county. Thi
paper has left it to Mr. Phillips U
tell why ho acted in this manner.
Has ho explaiucd? No, emphatically
NO. Now bear in mind that when
Mr. Phillips accepted these case
for the big corporation aii.1 the

county, and it wis his sworn duty
to defend the interests of tho coun

MrJ'hillips explained theso matters?
And will ho attemptto explain them?
He has had plenty of time before

fact that he has secured a number
of pleas of guilty in criminal cases.
