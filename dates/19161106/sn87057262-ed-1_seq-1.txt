NEW YORK, Nov. 6.—Tomorrow
[he
he American voter says -who will be
next president of the United
tates, dictates who will compose the
benate and chooses members of the
pcrase of representatives.
Viewing the situation today, twenty*'
fottr hours in advaflCg trf the bat^W Of
ballots and with claims from both
democrats and republicans of cock sure
rictory, it appeared that the people of
New York, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana
would come the nearest to holding the
Dalance of power.
Both sides claim this "big four" of
(states.
Their total in the electoral
college is 113—nearly 43 per cent of
the 2C6 votes necessary to a choice.
The strictest neutral—or even the
strongest republican for that matter—
concedes the democrats the "solid
south"—a block of 136 votes. This
136 comprises the electoral votes of
Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro
lina, Georgia. Florida, Alabama, Mis
sissippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,
Tennessee and Oklahoma. It does not
Include Kentucky and Missouri, here
tofore classified as Component parts
of the solid south, and this year claim
ed by democrats still to be in that
[section, but adjudged by republicans
to be debatable ground.
In the presidential race, therefore.
I Republican Candidate Hughes starts
off with his opponent given a handicap
of 13C votes. But ho also has been
granted by the democrats a handicap
from scratch of seventy votes—the
electoral total of six states, Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Is
land, Pennsylvania and Iowa.
That leaves "Wilson with a net
handicap in the vote race of sixty-six
shares in the electoral college.
But unless there is a cataclysm in
toe voting tomorrow, the strictly neu
trals admit that the 113 votes of the
"Wg four" states will be the real
turning point in the election. The
democrats claimed all four today so
did the republicans.
In Illinois lies the real enigma—
close to 800,000 new women voters. Be
cause they are new In their exercise of
the franchise and because they are
woqaen, political prognosticators were
exceedingly shy In making any pre
dictions on the Sucker state today.
In New York—the state with the
big forty-five votes in the electoral
college, the problem the republicans
fcced was to keep the New York City
normal democratic majority down and
fcoost up the normal republican up
state majority to as high a point as
possible. Publicly last minute claims
Were:
Republicans: Hughes will win New
York by from 100,000 to 150,000.
Democrats: Wilson will win by at
least 100,000.
Indiana and Ohio have been strenu
ous battle grounds during the cam
paign. The air has been filled with
oratory, red fire, debate and charges

Poland Discusses Important Factors

What Polish leaders believe the most
important factors to be considered in
the establishment of a Polish nation,
were outlined in a statement made
by the leader of a Polish delegation
which called cn the German chan
cellor and Austro-Hungarian foreign
minister, Baron Burian.
The statement carried In reports
from Vienna follows:
"During war time it is impossible
to select an authoritative representa
tive of the Polish nation. Meanwhile
we consider it our right to give ex
pression in the name of the Polish
nation of its unmistakable aspiration
to a
re-establishment
of a permanent
Polish state. This establishment must
be accompanied by guaranteeing
equal rights to all citizens. We
realize it is now impossible to de
linate the frontiers which can oa'.y
be decided in accordance-with tne
interests of the central powers and
the conditions under which the war
is brought to a conclusion."
The delegation believes the follow
ing decrees necessary:
"The appointment of a regent with
full power of government in the
Polish state.
Abolition of the lines of demarca
tion between the section of Poland
occupied by German forces and that
occupied by Austrians.

movement is strong, since, if suc

French front from Saillisel to Per

WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 6.—Dis
trict attorneys throughout the United
States today tightened the official
nation-wide investigation of food
prices announced yesterday by Attor
ney General Gregory. Sufficient evi
dence has been accumulated already
by district attorneys and department
of Justice Investigators to warrant
the declaration that the present in
crease in the necessities of life is
"abnormal and suspicious." In an
official statement the attorney gen
eral today declared this to be true.
"Wherever such increase is found
to be due to conspiracy or other un
lawful action, he said, "the depart
ment will invoke against the offend
ers the severest penalties which the
law provides."
Bread, milk and coal increases, it
was said at ihe department, are the
three principal objective points of the
investigation. Rise in these commo
dities—absolute necessities of life—
it was pointed out, strike right to
the economic heart of the nation.
If indictments were obtained in any
of these lines, it would have a whole
some effect on the producers In gen
eral, it is said.
Particularly ir the coal situation,
department of justice employes be
lieve they will be able to make out a
good case. Facts have been uncov
ered, they report, which indicate con
spiracy by coal operators and rail
ways to force up the price of fuel.
Federal investigators are said to be
unwilling to accept the railroads' ex
cuse of Insufficient cars to handle
the coal as explaining the shortage.

Death for Being a

THEN GO TO PARRAL
Terr In That Place May Have Suffered
Same Fate Unless They
Were Enabled to
Escape.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
EL PASO, TexaB, Nov. 6.—Every
energy of the U. S. state department
today is belli/? directed toward ob
taining knowledge of the fate of ten
Americans known to have been In
Parral. And apprehension aroused
fever heat on the arrival of four
Americans lait night, who fled from
Parral, bringing further reports oi
the murder of Dr. Fisher, aged Amer
ican in Santa Rosalia by Vlllista
bandits.
After hunting down and killing Dr.
Fisher, the bandits told the inhabi
tants of the town they were "going
to Parral and kill those 'gringoes',"
natives reaching Chihuahua City aft^r
the raid told the refugees. In othe?
quarters here hope is held out that
the Americans were able to escape
before the bandits reached Parral.
Representatives of mining companies
employing some Americans declare
their belief that the men are safe,
but admit thsir anxiety has been
aroused by the lack of news. In a
message to the United Press, General
Trevino, commander of the Mexican
defacto garrison at Chihuahua City,
stated he was unable to obtain any
news of the fate of Americans.
"Communication still cut off," said
the telegram ivom Trevino, "and havo
no Information from Parral. Making
efforts to get news."
On the same train bringing the
American refugees last night were
the families of two staff officers of
Trevino and tl*e families of seven
French residents of the Chihuahua
capital leaving there in fear that
Villa will next attack that city. They
crossed to the American side of vhe
I river. Every foreigner coming out
I predicts that the city will be eva-ni
ated if Villa makes another attack,
W. E. Phillips, secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. of Chihuahua City was
one of the refugees.
"It is almost certain Fisher was
killed," he said. "A well known
native cattleman who came overland
from Santa Rosalia declared that the
doctor hid when the bandits raided
the town. Upon orders, he was hunt
ed down and stabbed to death.
"In Chihuahua City it is believed
