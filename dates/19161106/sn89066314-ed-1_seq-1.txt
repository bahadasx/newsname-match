DRITY OF COUNTY
T
E. Sidney Stephens Says 90
Per Cent of Voters arc For
the Special Issue.
TO WORK AT POLLS
Repeal Would Reduce Tax
Levy Only Ten Cents on
Hundred Dollars.
The Columbia Special Road District
will receive the support of fully 90
per cent of the voters at the election
tomorrow. This Is the opinion of E.
Sidney Stephens, chairma of the
committee of citizens and farmers who
are supporting the district Last week
six meetings were held over the dis
trict in its support. "Only five men
were found who were against the dis
trict." Mr. Stephens said today.
"Columbia will be organized tomor
row to win the election. Workers will
be at the polls to work for it. Prac
tically all of the voters here will sup
port the district. There are about 3,-
000 voters in the district, and of the
number only 300 or less will vote
against the measure. Columbia will
practically vote solid for it. This is
certain as Columbia citizens are now
pajing about SO per, cent of the cost
of its support,!' said Mr. Stephens.
Victor B. Jones, secretary of the
Commercial Club, who has been tak
ing an active part in the fight sup
porting the district voiced the same
opinion as Mr. Stephens. He showed
by figures that the tax payers would
gain practically nothing by abolishing
it. "A general levy of twenty-five
cents is now paid to support the
roads of Boone County. When the"
special road district was organized it
was bonded $100,000. This bonded-Indebtedness
still has eleven years to
run. A twenty-five cent levy is as
essed to pay off this bonded indebt
edness. An additional ten cent levy
is assessed for the maintenance of the
district. Now, if the district was
abolished the voters would only save
the ten cent levy, for the twenty cent
levy still has eleven years to run,"
said Mr. Jones.
Mr. Stephens and Mr. Jones said the
farmers as a unit would support the
district as they realize the benefit of
good roads to them and that if the
district was abolished the roads in it
would sink to the level of the roads
over the county.
A mass meeting at the courthouse
Saturday brought out a distinctive
sentiment in favor of the district.
Representatives from different sec
tions of the county made this evident
by informal discussion of its bene
fits.
E. C. Cllnkscale3 said he was op
posed to the abolition of the district.
E. W Stephens said it was the most
progressive movement Boone County
has undertaken in the last twenty
five ears. "The County Is recogniz
ing the value of good roads, and I can
not imagine the people of the county
voting against such a movement I
am at a loss to know where the op
position comes from, and why its sup
porters do not come out into the open
with legitimate criticism," said Mr.
Stephens at the mass meeting.

CALLS OLD U. S. BEST, AFTER ALL
Prof. C, G. Ross Writes a Letter From
Australia to E. IV. Howe.
"The United States, I'm convinced,
is the best country on earth. Every
American ought to leave his country
for a while just in order to find out
what a fine land it is," says Prof.
Charles G. Ross of the School of Jour
nalism in a'letter to E. W. Howe, pub
lished in the Atchison, Kan., Globe.
This came as the result of his' obser
vations in Australia. He says that
unionism there is carried to the n-th
power. The power of the labor party
lis such a menace that it drives capi
tal away from the country. Strikes
are frequent. It is possible that the
unions will split on the conscription
question.
"Australia, as near as I can judge,
has been so busy trjing to improve
the condition of society in the masses
that she has had no time for the in
dividual," sas Mr. Ross. "Rents are
outrageously high. The houses are
built together like city tenements.
Since the war the cost of living has
increased 30 per cent"
Mr. Ross agrees with Mr. Howe,
who, in his travel letters from Aus
tralia, said that there the people had
tried all the reforms now threatening
the United States and that the re
forms had not worked there any more
than they will here.
SANTA FE MAY GO TO ST. LOUIS
Line Might Run Through Columbia
From Mexico to CarrolKon.
It is possible that the Santa Fe rail
road may extend its lines to St. "Louis,
according to yesterday's St. Louis Re
public. It is proposed that the Santa
Fe build a road fom Carrollton to
Mexico, and use the Burlington tracks
from there to St. Louis.
There have been many reports in
the past that the Santa Fe would pass
through Columbia should It ever run
its road to St. Louis. It Is said that
the railroad has already bought ter
minal property in St. Louis, but prob
ably will use the Union Station there.
If the Santa Fe enters St. Louis, It
will be able to get much more long
distance traffic over its 11,000 miles of
track.
COUNTY
DEMOCRATIC
013.000
A
Local Politician Predicts
Easy Victory Republicans
Also Are Confident.
LEADERS ARE BUSY
Student Voters to Be Sought
Tomorrow Largest Vote
Ever, Prophesied.
Official election day will begin at
G o'clock in the morning and from in
dications there will be a larger vote
cast in Columbia than ever before.
Local politicians and party leaders
are putting on the finishing touches
this afternoon and are trying to line
up all voters, both city and student.
AH voting will be done at the court
house, as there is but one polling
place for the four precincts. A spec
ial table will be equipped to take care
of the absentee voters and all students
in the University who are eligible to
vote are urged to register their choice
tomorrow.
J. E. Boggs, Democratic loader, said
this afternoon that Missouri would go
25,000 for Wilson and Gardner, with
the ticket a little behind. He also pre
dicts that Boone County will go tor
Wilson and Gardner by 3,000 or 3,300.
"I was in the country yesterday,"
said Mr. Boggs, "and the prospects
were never better for a Democratic
victory. We are sure to win. I oan
see no way that the Republicans can
stop us. The Central Committee, with
the aid of the Student Democratic
Club, has gotten word to all Democrat
ic voters in this county and there is
certain to be a big turnout at the
polls tomorrow. We will have helpers
tomorrow who will be on hand to aid
the students In filling out absentee
voters' affidavits and we are expecting
the largest student vote ever polled
in Columbia. When the polls close to
morrow night I am confident that the
Democrats will have 'held the line'."
w EA. Remley,' chairman oMhe local
Republican Committee, expresses the
same confidence in behalf of the Re
publican party. "I believe", said Mr.
Remley this afternoon, "that Hughes
will carry Missouri by at least 15,000
and that Lamm will'be elected gover
nor by a 25,000 majority. Dickey is
sure to beat Reed by 25,000 and the
rest of the State ticket will be elected,
though by considerably smaller ma
jorities. Hughes is certain to be
elected."
Tomorrow will decide which is right.
Everything has been done in the way
of campaigning and the leaders can
do nothing now but wait and see how
much effect their work has had. Both
parties are counting on a large vote
from the students here and special ar
rangements have been made to take
care of the votes. Twenty-four elec
tion judges will have charge of the
election tomorrow.
WOULD HIKE 500 MILES IN TEAR
Christian College Girls In Club to
Cover Scenic Boone County.
While some persons ride around in
carriages and automobiles and admire
the wonderful works of nature found
near Columbia, about thirty Christian
College girls hike to the same spots
of" interest. A hiking club has been
organized at the college, and it is the
aim of each girl to walk 500 miles
this school year.
Miss Julia Groves, who is head of
the club, thinks this distance can eas
ily be covered, and more too, but has
just placed the distance at 500 miles
as a goal worth striving for. Some
of the girls are from Oklahoma, Texas,
and other states. While in Columbia
we wish to see as much of the sur
rounding country as possible.
One afternoon each week the mem
bers of the club, arrayed in tramping
togs, may be seen hiking to Rollins
Spring, Balanced Rock or some other
familiar place. One girl in the crowd
carries a pedometer in order that the
exact number of miles made on each
tramp may be recorded.
The girls not only see Columbia's
beauty spots but are benefitted by the
walks. Doctors claim that walking is
one of the most beneficial exercises a
person can take. A rosy complexion
Is not the only gain; much grace of
movement comes in for its share.

M. IT. THIRD INSTEAD OF FOURTH
Change in Rank Found In Judging at

The dairy judging team of the Col

Mass., instead of fourth, as originally
reported. A error in figuring was
found. E. M. Harmon of the Missouri

these scholarships. Nine have been
used at the University of Missouri;
four at Cornell, three of these by Mis

FOUR STATES HOLD
OF
Illinois, Ohio, New York and
Indiana Will Cast 115 of
the Electoral Votes.
MISSOURI IN DOUBT
Solid South's 136 Conceded to
Democrats Opposition
Accords Hughes 70.
tly United Press
NEW YORK, Nov. 6. Tomorrow the
American voter will say who will be
Ihe next President of the United
States, will dictate who will compose
the Senate, and will select tho new
House of Representatives. Viewinc
he situation today, twenty-four hours
n advance of the battle and with
claims from both Democratic and Re
publican leaders, nearly everyone
agrees that Illinois, Ohio, Indiana
and New York will hold! the balance of
power.
- The total of these four states in the
electoral college is 115 votes, nearly
43 per cent of the 2GG votes necessary
to elect a President. The strictest
neutrals and even the strictest Repub
licans accord the Democrats the 13G
votes of the "solid South," comprising
Virginia, both Carolinas, Georgia,
Florida. Alabama. Mississlnnl. Texas.
Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and
Oklahoma. It does not Include Ken
tucky and Missouri, heretofore classed
in the "solid South" and claimed by
Democrats to be in that division, but
by Republicans to be debatable
ground.
In the presidential race, Hughes is
accorded by neutrals 13G votes. The
Democrats, however, grant him only
seventy votes Maine, New Hamp
shire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Penn
sylvania and Connecticut. That leaves
Wilson with an accorded lead of sixty-six
shares in the race. But, un
less there is a landslide in the voting
tomorrow, the strict neutrals admit
that the votes of the four doubtful
states will be the turning point. The
Democrats claim all four of these
states; so do the Republicans.
In New York, the state with the big
forty-five votes in the electoral col
lege, the problem of the Republicans
first Is to keep New York City's'nor
mal Democratic majority down. The
Republicans claim that Hughes will
carry New York by 100,000 to 150,000.
The Democrats claim that Wilson will
win the state by at least 100,000.
Between $9,000,000 and $10,000,000
will change hands over the election If
estimates of betting experts today are
correct.
Commissioners here figured be
tween $5,000,000 and $6,000,000 will be
New York's total wagered while about
$2,500,000 was reported placed in Chi
cago, Denver, San Francisco, and Cin
cinnati with considerable unreported
in many places.
Down in the frenzied swirl of Wall
street bets are being held at 10-8 for
Hughes while odds of 10-7 are asked,
and some bets placed 10-7 and 10-7
as against 10-7 of recent days.
Another report said Wilson money
was going up with prospects of 10-9
before night. The rest is quoted at
10-9 for Hughes.
