speeches today but most of the ac

or Democratic state committees today,
those leaders apparently being content

BOTH nmiRMEN CONFIDENT
Sessions Claims 30 000 to 40,000

Lardner Looks for Wilson and
Congressmen Re-Election.
Activities In both Republican and
Democrat state headquarters will be i
suspended tonight and the men who j
have directed the political battle in j
Kansas, during the last few weeks, will
await the verdict of the voters in 1
Tuesday's election. Predictions today j
of clear skies for Tuesday brought
claims from both parties that a heavy
vote favored their chances in the pres-
idential and congressional fights in j
this state. Charles . Sessions, Republl- 1
can chairman; and Hubert Lardner,'
had of. tha T&mocrat -state committee j
renewed their assertions that they
would win.
Nearly every pound of campaign lit
erature was mailed from state head
quarters Saturday. Today the state
leaders conferred with workers thru
out the state and several hundred dol
lars were spent for telephone and tele
graph service. Final instructions were
sent county chairmen and tonight the
final move in the campaign will have
been directed. The real work in the

workers in the 105 counties who direct
the fighting in the trenches .and carry
the party banner in the local precincts.
Bright Election Pay.
With assurances from the weather
bureau that clear skies will greet Kan
sas voters Tuesday, both state chair
men today claimed advantage. Chair
man Sessions claimed Kansas for
Hughes by a majority of 25.000 to
40,000 over President Wilson. He also
claimed certain election of six Repub
lican congressmen, with conditions fa
vorable to the election of Republicans
in all of the eight districts of the state.
A full state ticket and a majority in
both legislative branches, were also
claimed.
For the Democrats, Chairman Lard

election of all of the six Democrat
congressmen. Lardner, however, did
not indulge in majorities or pluralities.
He will leave tonight for his home in
Fort Scott to vote.
Special Wire Service.
Both Republican and Democrat
state headquarters will be open Tues

Itritish Plunger Scores a Hit on Ger
man Dreadnaught.
London, Nov. 6. A German dread
naught was torpedoed yesterday off
the Danish coast by and eEnglish sub
marine, the admiralty announced to
day. The damage done is not known, it
was stated. It is known, however
that the German warship was hit
The announcement follows: One of
our submarines operating in the North
sea reports that she fired torpedoes at
a German battleship of the dread
naught type near the Danish coast
yesterday. The vessel was hit. The
amount of damage is unknown.
The British announcement gives no
intimation whether any considerable
portion of the German high seas fleet
was on the North sea . yesterday. It
was off the Danish coast that the
main German and British fleets en
gaged in battle last May. On several
occasions the German fleet has left its
base for short cruises in the North sea.
Ordinarily a dreadnaught would not
be employed merely for reconnoiter-ln.
GIRL OF 14 TELLS
OF A BLACKMAIL
PLANjNTOPEKA
Declares Her Mother Used Her
as Lure for Men.
Took Money From Victims
Among Rich Here.
SHE WAS UNWILLING VAMPIRE
Gladys Frisbie Giyes Away Se
cret to Police Officers.
Procured $8 From One Wealthy
Aged Topeban.
Fourteen-year-old Gladys Frisbie
doesn't fit the popular conception of
the "vampire." She is lacking in age
and in experience in the ways of men
and women. She's Just a child. But
she told county officers today, between
sobs, that her own mother, Lucy "War
ner, had been using her as a lure for
men for two years with the object of
blackmail.
The little girl's story Indicates that
she has been a very unwilling "vam
pire;" that while she has been more
or less successful in shaking down old
men with long purses and short mem
ories, she had no heart in the game.
But at that, she says she would have
gone on and -on had not some neigh
bor told Miss Kate King that the girl
needed looking after.
The child's mother, Lucy Warner,
came to Topeka about state fair time,
in company with a Greek named An
drew Speel. The three have been liv
ing together at 210 East Fifth street
Mrs. Warner is about 35 years of age
while Speel is only 23. The girl says
they are not married and that her
mother is not divorced from a former
nusoana named. Warner.
. "We came to Topeka from Pennsvl
vania," said Gladys, "and we had to
leave there in a hurry. By using me
they took $900 from an old man "
According to the girl's story a To
pekan, an old man reputed to have
plenty of money, had been marked as
a victim.
Went Out With Him.
"Because mother insisted upon it I
have been out with him several times,"
said the girl, "and I think she got sev
en or eight dollars from him. But
things were not ready to hit him hard,
she said. I have been scared and
didn't know what to do. She has
made me do things I did not want to
do and she told me that if there was
any trouble for me to say I was over
it years old. But I know I am only
14 years old.'
County officials have the name of
the aged Topekan who appears to have
! laiien into the toils of the Warner
woman. They have not consulted him.
j If the girl's story develops sufficient
ly he will find that he has uncovered
'a deep vein of trouble in "running
around'' with the 14 year old girl.
1 Gladys Frisbie was almost a nervous
, wreck when Miss King took her in
charge Sunday afternoon. She became
more nervous as the evening progress
ed and it was necessary to call a
physician to quiet her. It was to the
physician that the girl first told her
; story. She repeated it today to Har
' vey Parsons, chief of police, and later
to Robert Garver, assistant county at
torney.
"You are sure your mother and this
Greek are not married? was asked.
Her Father Is Dead.
"How can they be married when my
mother is not divorced from Mr. War
ner?" countered the girl. "My own
father died years ago then my mother
married Mr. Warner. They separated
and not long ago she took up with this
Greek, Speel. He's only 23 years of
age and my mother is twelve years
older than he is."
Following the statements of the girl
a warrant was issued for Mrs. Warner
and Andrew Speel. Charles Hixon and
Joseph Holman, deputy sheriffs, took
the warrant to serve It at 210 East
Fifth street and learned from neigh
bors that the man and woman left
there early today. The girl talked to
her mother over the telephone from
the police station at 8 o'clock this
morning, but apparently the couple
left town after that.
I The mother has deserted her daugh
! ter. The girt wondered today, even
i after she told of the things she alleges
her mother had forced upon her, what
S was to become of her without her par
ent. It was with difficulty that or
ficers kept her quiet long enough to
get her story. Once, while she was
telling it to Robert Garver, a door
slammed and she sprang out of her
chair. Temporarily she will be placed
in the county detention home.

ROBERT STONE
Hundreds of circulars are being
used and many men are working to
day in an effort to defeat Robert
Stone for representative in Shawnee
county. The fight is based on the
fact that Mr. Stone is a good lawyer
and that the value of his services were
recognized by several corporations
which were willing to pay good fees
for his professional advice and service.
Mr. Stone has represented Shawnee
county in the legislature twelve years.
He has fought for every interest of To
peka and Shawnee county. He never
shirked and he was constantly on the
job. He worked for the most con
structive legislation written in Kansas
in the years he has been a member of
the house.
Six years ago when Governor Stubbs
was charged with throwing Stone in
the speakership fight. Stone did not
sulk in the Republican tent. He
worked with Speaker Buckman in the
enactment of progressive, constructive
laws. Following Stone's election as
speaker in 1915, he fought the pork
barrel program of minority members.
In the state fair fight, in the fight
for Memorial hall, for the state print
ing plant, for the paving claim, for
the state house white way and for
every measure that benefited Topeka
and Shawnee county. Stone worked
untiringly for the interests of his con
stituents.
Now it is charged that Stone is an
attorney for the Kansas Natural Gas
company. It is asserted he is an at
torney for certain insurance com
panies. It is claimed that he is the
attorney for large grain companies.
Granted- These corporations select
lawyers who are worthy of their hire.
It has never been charged that Robert
Stone was not faithful to every trust.
Nor is it claimed he did not represent
Shawnee county's interests in the leg
islature. But because he is a lawyer
of ability, Shawnee county has been
asked to defeat one of the most valu
able representatives elected in recent
years.

El Paso. Nov. 6. Every energy of
the United States state department
today is being directed toward obtain
ing knowledge of the fate of the ten
Americans known to be in Parral and
apprehension was roused to fever
heat uDon the arrival last night of
four Americans who fled from Chi
huahua, bringing further reports of
the murder of Dr. C. H. Fisher, aged
American, in Santa Rosalia, by Villista
bandits.
After hunting down and killing Dr.
Fisher, the bandits told the inhab
itants of the town they were "going
to Parral and kill those gringoes," na
tives reaching Chihuahua City after
the raid told the refugees.
In official quarters here hope is held
out that the Americans were able to
escape before the bandits reached Par
ral. Representatives of mining com
panies employing some of the men de
clare their belief that the men are
safe, but admit their anxiety.
Many Re-fugccs Coming Out. .
In a message, General Trevino, com
mander of the Mexican de facto gar
rison at Chihuahua City, stated he was
unable to obtain any news of the fate
of the Americans.
"Communication still cut off," said
the telegram from Trevino. "Have no
information from Parral. Making ef
forts 'o get news."
On the same train bringing the
American refugees last night were the
families of two staff officers of Tre
vino and the families -of seven French
residents of the 'Chihuahua capital
leaving, there in fear that Villa will
next attack that city. They crossed
to the American side of the river.
Every foreigner coming out predicts
that the city will be evacuated If
Villa makes another attack.

of the refugees.

"It is almost certain Fisher was
killed," he said. "A well known na
tive cattleman who came overland
from Santa Rosalia declared that ihe
doctor hid when the bandits entered
the town. Upon orders of the Villijta
commander he was hunted down and
stabbed to death.
"In Chihuahua City it is believed
Parral is in possession of Villa, but
we heard nothing of the fate of the
