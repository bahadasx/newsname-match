Announcement Made at New

International News Sorvite:
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. Nov. C.
Theodore Roosevelt will be the next
secretary of state if Hughes Is elect
ed, according to William A. Pren
dersast. who presided at a Hughes
meeting in New York Saturday
r.lght, and the Indianapolis Star,
which made the announcement In its
columns Sunday morning. This has
Peen suspected for a long time by
the public, but Prendergast's an
nouncement Saturday night was the
first otlicial word to this effect.
I5y making the statement that
Theodore Roosevelt would be the
next secretary of state, Prendergast
lost thousands of votes in New York
and the east, and the Indianapolis
Star unconsciously threw a lot of
votes to Wilson in Indiana. Prender
past also took a lot for granted
when he introduced Candidate
Hughes to the audience as Pres't
Hughes. In its telegraph report of
the meeting the Indianapolis Star
said:
"The applause swelled of its own
accord and was Ktill swelling when
Mr. Prendergast tried to stop it to
introduce Mr. Hughes. 'He who
will now address you.' began Mr.
Prendergast. 'needs no introduction.
The nation knows him. I, however,
shall take the liberty of addressing
him as the nation will address him
on March 4 next.' '
"inen turning anu r.owing to .vir.

while the election of Hughes, they
have been more than reasonably sure,
means "war, want and destruction."
The Indianapolis News said edi
torially a short time ago, "With any
ether president than Woodrow Wil
son we might at this time be up to
our necks in slaughter and blood
shed." Candidate Hughes undoubtedly
looks with much favor upon Roose
velt, for, according to the Star, he
lauded Roosevelt in his speech for
his "excellent work in the campaign
and in reuniting the republican
party."
If this public announcement has
the same effect in all parts of the
state and nation that it has in In
dianapolis and Marion county, it has
assured the reelection of Woodrow
Wilson by an all but unanimous
vote. The voters as election day ap
proaches, and especially with such
revelations as are coming daily from
the republican party, do not pro
pose to gamble with honorable
peace and unprecedented prosperity,
which the administration of Wood
row Wilson has brought to 100,000,
