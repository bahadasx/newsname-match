TWO BOND ISSUE PLANS
SURE, OTHERS DOUBTFUL
Breckons Says Democrats
, Concede G. 0. P. Victory
on West Hawaii
A "clean sweep? tor Delegate Ku
hi with a majo-fty of at least 1000
votes on Oahu aloae,' is the prediction
of Rfpublican paty leaders regard
ing :he general election tomorrow. The
opinion in G. O. P circles is that Ku
hio will win ""hands down," polling a
larger vote than ever before. . '
Party leaden who hav been cloeely
associated with Kuhio and other Re
publican candidates during the cam
paign which closes today, have made
the following prediction which cov
ers not only the delegateshlp but the
senatorial and house tickets and the
bond issue: " : ;
In the senatorial ticket the party
will elect two without any doubt on
Oahif and might lose one, Correa, un
less the fourth district voters adhere
to the straight ticket In the fourth
district, on the house, the party will
elect five and . probably lose one. In
the fifth district there are possibilities
of Kupihea and Miles, Democrats, be
ing elected. Aside from these all oth
er Republican candidates will be
elected. ; , ; '';;'"
On this island Kuhio will have a
majority oj lOOOYrjtesop Maul about
four to " one; Za TCaiaat ' the VOtlrrg
will be about even; on Hawaii Kuhio
will win by three to one. This is con
sidered very conservative estimate.
On the bond issue the belt road pro
posal and the public baths, building,
will certainly carry, all other1 pro
posals doubtful. It is believed that
the campaign for the various, ' pro
posals was not, started early enough.
Harry E. Murray vice-chairman of
the Republican . central committee,
predicts that en Oahu alone: Kuhio
will have a majority of 875 and that
in the fourth district the Republican
representatives and senators will all
be elected. In. the fifth district, he
believes, the Republican candidates
will have a hard race, but with every
chance of being elected.
National Committeeman R. W. Brec
kons says: ; "-'
"Kuhio will" have a majority of not
less than 2000. O i Maui the entire
Republican house ill" be. elected, but
there will be a v ry close fight be
tween Ccoke and- Raymond for the
senate, Raymond, I believe, has a
shade the tetter oi it, but the race
will be close.
. "Kauai will elect Jack "Coney, and
there will be a clean sweep with a sub
stantial majority for Kuhio. On Ha
waii there wTfl' be u very substantial
majority for Kuhio. In West Hawaii
the Democrats concede the election of
the entire Republican ticket with a
big majority for Kuhio."
Breckons had nothing to say on the
tond issue.
