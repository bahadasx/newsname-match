(rrnm Tha. Tribune. Bureau ]
Washington, Nov. 6. The rock bot

House will be 217, compared with a
possible 216 Democrats, two Progrres
ahrflS and a Socialist, aecord'njr to care

The Tribune correspondent This list

reliable information can be obtained,
there is any reasonable doubt. It
claim? for thc Republicans only theflfl
difltrleta which in many instances the
Democrnts themselves concede or about
which thev are admittedly verv doubt?
ful.
This is not the claim of the Repub?
licans. Krank P. Woods, chairman of
the Republican Contrressional Commit?
tee. eontidentlv predicts a majority of
at least 27. Working: on the same kind
of reports two years a-?o, Mr. Woods
publicly predicted within one of the
Democratic majority of the present
House.
Mr. Woods considers that the Repub?
licans have an even chance or better
to obtain control of the Senate. The
best information The Tribune can ob?
tain is that the Republicans will cut
down the D<moeratic majority in the
Senate to ?t most 8, and probably
less, but that there is practically no
chance of the Republicans capturing
the Senate.

The present Democratic majority in

BELlEVESVICTORY
HAS BEEN ASSURED
Expects Next Speech Will
Be in Response to
His Election
Twer/y one weeks ago yesterday
Charles K. Hugh.s, ju I oaa day re?
tired from the Supreme Court, wa*
arondering whether he would bfl phyai?
abla to stand the grind o" month*
of campaigning after one of the sever
flflt ?.?ar's work thr curt ever experi
enced. N'o vacation aflfliaed pOBfllblfl
rntil after N'ovember 7, nearly tive
months away.
Yesterday Mr. Hutrhes. ab?olutely
conf.dcnt that he will be elected Presi?
dent of the I'nited States to-morrow
and enjoying better health than ho has
Vad in ten years, received the BflWfl
paper men 4vho have been with him
throughout the campaign in his rooms
at thp Hotel Astor. He fairly radiated
contidence. It was all over Kut the |
.shouting, so far as he was concerned.
And n<".er have these campaign com
panions seen him in such a jovial
frame of mind.
Not (.lad It's Over
He confi.led to some that it was quite
dir-appointing to wake up promptly at
7 o'clock yesterday morning rcalizing
that there would not be any cheering
rrowds at the rear platform waiting
for a speech. So he turned over. I.ater
in the day it was plain that he bad re
laxed completely fpom the strain of
the campaign and was almost prepared
to recei>e a telegram that might read
something like this: "Presidert Wilson
concedes the election of Mr. Hughes,"
etc, etc.
Mr. Hughes expects that hi* next
public ut*rance will have something
to do with somp such news. His cam?
paign is er.ded. He believes he will
win. He has a faith in the American
people that refuses to be troubled.
Ffforts to draw him out in a public
r-tatement were futile It may be stated,
however. that he regards the latest
charges of Presid.-nt Wilson and his
managers as unworthy attempts to stir
up class pie.judie. s ifl thfl fever heat
of the t'nal days. before election. The
American public, lie believes. knows
enough about his public record to re- ,
ject these insinuation without his com?
ing to his own defence.
Has Been Real Pleasure
The campaign, in apitfl of its labors,:
has been a considerable pleasure to
both Mr. and Mrs. Hughes. Starting
three months ago. .vhen Mr. Hughes
began his tirst Western tour, from
eoafll to coast. it has been a progressive
devclopment. according to Mr. Hu<,hcs'*
own intentions. reaching its climax in
the ovation at Madison Square ("arden
Batarday night and the monster utrcet
parade. Mr. Hughes remarked yester
daj* that he deeply appreciated what
that demonstration meant, because he
haa aaarehad himself in such outpour
ings of the people.
Looking at the campaign from thp
stnn.ipoint of the jurist. he regards his
case complete before the eountry's vot
ers. I'oth sides are in. Mr. Hughes
has gone straight to the people
throughout the I'nited States and pre?
sented his cause, just as he used to en?
list the support of the people of N'ew
York State when their help was needed
to earrv out his plans as ('overnor.
Mr. Hughes will not make any more
speeches until it is over. lie will
gather his family about him at the
hotel to-morrow night and receive re
turns over two special wires run into
his suite. He flrill vote early in the
morning from the hotel. casting hia
ballot in s laundry shop on Fighth
Avenue, near Forty fifth Street. and
probably will take m motor rsde with
Mrs. Hughes some time later in the day.
last night he spent with Mr. and Mrs.
t'harles E. Hughes, jr., and their chil?
dren at their town house, on Riverside
Drive._

5 KILLED, 40
SHOT IN NAVAL
RAIDBYI.W.W.
Thousand Shots Fired
in Battle with Everett,
Wash., Citizens
SEATTLE MILITIA
NOW UNDER ARMS
Boatload of Invaders Are
Driven Off?Planned to
Wipe Town Off Map
[n< Nflfltaflt to Iaa Mta -
Fverett, Wash., N'ov. o. In a naval
raid on this city to-day two hundred
and f.fty armed Industrial Workers of
the World were driven off only after a
batile at the city wharf between the
ra-.ders and a posse of 150 citizens, in
which tive men were killed and forty
seriously wounded. The I. W. W. men
arrived from Seattle about '' o'clock on
the specially chartered steamer Vp
rona, and in the resulting battle at
lea.st one thousand shots were tired.
The fight came as a result of efforts
of the city authorities to prevent a
free-sneech meeting of I. W. W.'s from
all parts of the world, which had been
called for to-day.
The Yerona steamed away for Se?
attle, whence she had come, after a
battle which raged for half an hour.
One man lay dead and several wounded
on the city pier. On the vessel when
shr reached Seattle four were found
dead and more than a score seriously
wounded.
Among f'o?e here in a critical con
ilHion from their wounds is Sheriff
Don McCrae. who headed the posse
of citizeiu that gathered to defend
their hom-\. from the invaders.
Bullet* Rained on Invaders
As the armed men on the wharf
poured a haii of bullets upon the
steamer the courage of the I. 'V. W.'s
began ? wane, and before the Yerona
drew a ,ay panic had seized scores of
the fighters. In terror, as bullets
spatter.d about them, dozens leaped
fraa* thr steamer and sought safety
in the water. Others fled below de*ks,
leaving their wounded comrades un
larnl for on deck. But the bolder
s|ints .mong the invaders stood by
their guns and sent shot aft.pr shot
whizzing over the water at tha de
fenders on the pier until the Verona
had rteamed out of range.
Of the 1 W. W 's who leaped into the
wntcr *..eral were rescued by boats
which put out immediately after the
battle. 1 ese were made prisonerg. It
is believed, however, that many who
leaped overboard were drowned.
Had the tight continued a few min?
utes longer vietory probably would
have rested with the I. W. W. ma
rauders and Fverett would be helpless
in their possession to-alght. Another
vpsspI, thp Caiista. carrving a second
band of 150 Industrial Workers, was
cn its way to reinforcr the attackers on
the Verona. The Verona. retreating
ufter the heavy t're of the citizens had
won the day, met the Caiista at Mu
kilteo. four miles south of Everett.
The twa vessels returned to Seattle to?
gether.
C 0. Curtis, formerly a lieutenant
in Company L, td Infantry, Washing?
ton National Guard, was the member
of the citizens' posse killed.
Following is the list of dead mem?
bers of the Industrial Workers of the
World: Hugo Gerlot, Milwaukee,
Wi-., seaman; Johnny Looney. Ayer
Junction, Mass., laborer; Harry Pierce,
Seattle. laborer; Gus Johnson, labor?
er; Falls Baron, laborer.
It was said that two others were so
badly wounded that they probably
would die.
Gnardsmen I'nder Arms
Adjutant General Maurice Thompsoti
of the Washington National Guard
was ordered to Everett to-night by
(,overnor I.ister to report to him on
coaditiaaa here. Refore leaving Seat?
tle thr adjutant general ordered all the
National Guard organizations in that
city to report immediately for duty.
This brought under arms four com
ranies of coast artillery, four com?
panies of infantry and two divisions of
the naval militia.
The trouble that culminated in to
day's battle had been brewing fo
months. It was the outgrowth of n
strike of shingle wea\ers here. in which
the I. W. W. had taken a hand. As -4
result of several smaller outbreaks of
violence Sheriff McCrao had ordered
the expulsion of all members of that
organizatlon from Everett. The meet?
ing of all n embers of the I. W. W.
called for to-day in Everett was a move
of defiance by the Industrial Worker*
to bring the Situation to a crisis.
Warning that violence was to be ex?
pected to-day came at a meeting of the
I. W. W. at their Seattle headfluarters

Baron Mumm, adviser to the Ger?

that the proclanation was an earnest

There is apparently some dispute be?

govern the new state. The Kaiser, ac?
cording to reports, seeks to make a
Prusslan prince the king, while Fran

the monareh. Either, it is said, would
order a general mobilizatlon to defend
the independence of the country
against the Russians or any one elae.

by the Germans will be governed as
Warsaw has been governed since ita
capture. For the pregent General von
Heseler, former military governor of
Relgium, will be in chief authority.
An electoral system is to be estab

Found
Washington, Nov. 6. The rising
cost of living is to be investigated by
the government to ascertain whether
the inereasing prices are being pushed

British Assault Wins New
Ground on Heights
Near Bapaume
(Br Cab!* t* The Tttbua* )
London, Nov. 5.?The Freneh ob
lained important success.v on tha
Somme and tho Meuse fronts to-day,
crashing through the enerny's da
lVnees for their greatest advances in
days. Simultaneously v. ith their
ally's stroke, the Hritish "truck for?
ward north of the Somm* and r.iada
progress in the region immrditately
routh of Bapaume.
The Freneh suecesses on the
Somme front greatly strengtln ne.l
their grip on the Transloy region.
Between Laa* Bceufs and Sailly-Sail?
lisel their linos were advanced sev?
eral hundred yards nearer Transloy.
Kast of Sailly-Saillisel th.* greater
part of the village of Saillisel was
ronquered and an important trench
line taken.
Triple Attaek Is Snceessfnl
South of the village the Krench
troops assailed the powerfully forti
tied St. Pierre Vaast Wood from
three sides at the same time and suc
ceeded in seizing three trenches de
fending the northern part of tha
wood and sweeping the whole line of
the enerny's defences on ita south
western rim. The completed opera?
tion won for I'och's troops an ad?
vance of half a mile at nearly every
point on a four-mile line.
Haig's forces tightened their grip
on the important heights near th*?
Butte de Warlencourt, in the centre
of their front. The advance was
n*.ade along a 1,000-yard line in the
I rector nearest to Bapaume, thus di
1 rectly increasing the threat to that
position.
Big Gaina at Verdon
The continuance of their powerfu!
offenflive on the Verdun front won for
the Krench their moit important ?uc
cesses flince the fall of Kort Vaux.
Smashing throueh the enemy'fl linea
north and east of fort Vaux, Nivelle'a
troops conquered tne villages of Vaux
and Damloup. These two operation*,
carried out ny separate column* with
, perfect coordination. represent an ad?
vance north and ea?t of nearly two
i miles. ..
The Freneh lines are nov. straight
ened out along the entire l"*nt north
and northeast of Verdun. V'irtually
every position of any strength ha*
been swept behind the Krench lines
and the troops of the Crown Prince
show no indication of halting their
retreat to make a stand.
If the Krench commanders decid* to
press their advantage and continue tho
offensive beyond the limits of V?rdun's
' defences there i* no telling the extent
: to which their victones might b?
pushed, in the opinion of military man
, here. Whether the great battle of tha
| year will develop in this region in the
near future d.-pend* on whether tha
policy of the Allie* is to play safa or
j risk all for a decision.
Klank Mo4ement Expe-rted
With the advance of the Freneh linea
north of the Somme to a point wall
to the east of Bouchavcsncs and
Biachei on the no.rth, thera ia little
doubt that the next operation will ha?a
for it? purpoflc the flankina; of both
tho?e positions and the ?traightenin?
of the Krench front from the Saillisel
region south to the I'eronne sector.
: With thia carried through ?ucceaa
! fully, Koch would be able to ?tnk? a
' decisive blow at Peronne from th?
! north, west and south an operation
' which would sweep the gtronghold into
! the Krench lines.
The day's ?ucce*ses in the region
? west and south of Tr?n?loy bring tho
' envelopment of that po?ition nearer.
! Only tha desperate resifltance of tha
I (ierman* on that atretch of the Be
j thune road lying to the south of Tran?
sloy haa prevented ita leiiur* befora
this. , , .
