CONTROL OF CONGRESS
BIG ISSUE IN ELECTION
Democrats Likely to Hold Senate,
hut ltepuhllcnns May
Win House.
THIS FIGHT LOST SIGHT OP
G. O. I*. Spending Hig Sums in Kast
and West to Save Their Congres
sional Tickets, Kven Showing; Wil
lingness to Trade Hughes Votes.
I From a Staff Correspondent.]
XEW YORK, November 5.? In a lone,
li'arcl tight for the election of the next
President, the control of the next
House and Senate has been subordi
nated. however vital these two bodies
may be to the success of the incoming
administration.
It seems to have been assumed that
the? re-election of the President would
carry with it a Democratic Congress
hi both branches. Likewise, it has
been taken for granted that the suc
cess of Mr. Hughes would sweep the
Republicans into power In the House,
and perhaps In the Semite as well.
But there may be a serious miscal
culation in this connection. There Is
ground for believing that the next
President will find one body or other
of Congress In opposition to him. For
instance, the Republicans are making
an independent and apparently an ef
fective drive to overturn the Demo
cratic majority in the House. The
Democrats are concentratting all their
resources upon retaining control of the
Senate, whatever else happens.'
It is bv no means certain that the
next House will be Republican. Any
thing approaching a Democratic land
slide will carry the House along with
it. while anything short of a landslide
might give the Republicans more that!
an even chance to dominate the lower
branch of Congress./ They are spend
ing money like water. East and West,
to save their congressional tickets.
They have organized to the minutest
detail in every doubtful district, and
it is reported that in some there is a
willingness to trade Hughes votes fur
congressional votes.
KVKKY ADVANTAdK SKKMS
TO IIK WITH DKMOCHATS
With the Senate, it Is wholly dif
ferent Every advantage seems to lie
with the Democrats, and the prospect
Is that there will be a Democratic
Senate for the next two years, who
ever wins the presidency. Thirty-two
Senate seats become vacant on March
?I. 1017. Of that number, seventeen are
now occupied by Democrats, and flf
t c ? ? n by Republicans. The seat of
Senator Johnson, of Maine, already has
been tilled bv the election of Frederick
H >?<?>. Uennhllean, eliminating one of
the do111 ? tf'i! contents.
At present the .vnate Is Democratic
by a majority of sixteen. This means
that the Democrats may lose eii.it
v >tes and, if thev eb*ct the next Vice
I'resident. still be in :i position to c?>n

"I still stick to my prediction that

less. Advices received to-day confirm
my prophecy that New York, New

??Mr. McCortuick's figures are so ri
diculous they do not merit a moment's
serious consideration. Why does ha

fully warranted in doing so, if we aro
j to accept his estimate as to New York,
New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, Wiscon
sin and Connecticut.
"We are perfectly satisfied that we
i shall have more than 3<!0 votes in the
electoral college. I sincerely believe
that tve shall carry New York State
by at least 151.000 plurality."
President Wilson's final message to
