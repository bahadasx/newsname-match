OF SUNDAY'S I. W. W. BATTLE
FORWARD
OR—
BACKWARD
Forward or backward? Tomorrow your votes mint
tell.
I\> you remember a few vrars ago' Factories insani
tary. (lirls working endless hours. Yes, even children
at work. Do you remember?
No safety device- in the mill*. No compensation to
injured workmen. Do you remcmlnrr
No secrecy of thr ballot. Xo direct primaries. \o
popular voice in government. Do you remember?
No double platoon for firemen. n.> free text books
tor school children, no free playgrounds, no woman suf
irage, no pure food protection, no eight hour law*.
We H.W K advanced somewhat in the-« !a-t few vear
slowly but steadily. There is much more room for
progress Shall we continue to move forward «>r -hail
we -tand still," For you must remember tin-
It was not the John F. Millers who put their hearts
into the cause of progre-- and sacrificed their time and
labor to win a greater and broader liberty and humanity
in this state. It was the <»eorge I- ("ottenlls who did
that. It was not the Lvnn liadlev- m Helltngham It
■Kas thr Mrs. Frances Axtells of Bellingham It was the
; uf *!i!es Poindexter type of men who stood at the front of
I .-these battles.
They called the CotteriU- and the Axtells and thr
Poindexter* dreamers
1 he John Miller* and the lladlevs ridiculed them a*
"theori-t* They laughed at woman suffrage They
never lifted a voice for ANY eight-hour law. f.. r WY
lumanity-serving measure. Mothers* pensions were
"dreams." Minimum wages were "socialistic" and "an
archistic." And so on down the line.
As in the state, so in the nation. Pomorrow you mtJ't
lecide between Woodrow Wilson, who has gone for
ward and will go forward to a greater humanity ai d
peace with honor for this country—and I harles E
Hughes, the human enigma, silent as the Sphinx, s Ur .
rounded by men who have always fought progress, ex
cept Theodore Roosevelt, who is now thirsting for I>l<xkl
and war.
You must decide between PEACE and WAR tomor
row-for that is what the election is likely to mean We
must decide for PROGRESS AND HUMANITY or RE
ACTION AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGE.
And, in the Northwest particularly, we have the
Alaska and the Bremerton i«sue We need men in Wash
ingt'in who are A I HI-!ART for government ownership
We need Wilson. Poindexter. Cotterill, Mrs. Axtell.
'I hey <an serve Alaska and Bremerton more sincerely
and with l»etter effect than those who merely tolerate
government ownership l>ecause, juM now, they do not
dare to oppose it.
Forward? Then forget party lines , in d vote for
tlv>se who have fought for progress.
Note against the Frank Renicks. Bob Grasses, John R.
Wilsons, and their ilk in the legislature—men who took
pleasure in crippling mothers' pension laws and foisting
Renick law extravagances upon us.
Forward? Then lie sure to *ign Initiative Petition No.
2X for the nonpartisan election law, which means a new
freedom by breaking down narrow partisanship, and
saving YOU the embarrassment of proclaiming at the
primaries whether you shall vote republican, democratic,
or some other ticket.
Forward? Then vote against both brsize hill*. They
are hound to restore the saloon in a disguised form.
Forward? Then vote against the constitutional amend
ment and against every referendum measure. Vote
against them all because they destroy your voting
rights, your labor right, your right to freedom from
monopoly.
Tomorrow is YOUR flay. You must decide whether
e shall progress or go backward.

In l'M2 many of u becamc
members of the progressive
party not only because we be
lieved that the correction of
abuses inevitably developed
by an uncontrolled industrial
ism should become a vital
issue in federal politics, but
also because we were con
vinced that this modern type
of remedial legislation could
be accomplished only thru a
new party.
We predicted the sacrifice
of federal legislation and the
control of local issues if the
democratic party were elected;
the sacrifice of the popular
control of government and
the ascendency of business in
terests if the republican party
were placed in power.

DRAG EVERETT WATERS
FOR MORE VICTIMS AS
CORONER HOLDS INQUEST
Seven were dead and 50 wounded and 297 in jail here Monday
as a result of the gun battle between Seattle 1. W. W.'s and a
sheriff's citizens posse, in which 1,000 shots were fired when the
1. W. W.'s tried to land at Everett from the steamer Verona, to
hold a free speech demonstration there Sunday.
The list of dead was raised to seven when Deputy Sheriff
Beard, former sheriff of Snohomish county, died at 4:30 a. m.
Monday. Five dead are 1. W. W.'s, who were brought back here
Sunday.
There are 31 wounded 1. W.W.'s in the city hospital here, and 19
wounded members of the citizens' committee being cared for at
Everett.
There are 294 uninjured I. W. W.'s and three women organiz
er* in jail here. They were taken into custody when they returned
from Everett late Sunday.
That from three to five I. W. W. victims fell off the steamer
into the water after the opening volley was the opinion brought
out at die inquest conducted by Coroney Maulsby at Everett Mon-
day morning.
"We have been dragging all morning," the coroner said at
noon, "but have been unable to locate any of the bodies. We are
pretty certain that there are more dead. The testimony has estab
lished that." L ,^
A verdict was expected some time Monday afternoon.
Each faction Monday was preparing to charge members of the
other faction with murder.
Frank P. Walsh, former chairman of the federal industrial re
lations committee, which investigated the Ludlow massacre, will be
asked to investigate the Everett affair, by Herbert Mahler, local
I. W. W. secretary.
William D. Haywood, general I. W. W. secretary at Chicago,
has been asked to send legal aid and advice.

Planned to Burn City
That the I. W. W.'n had planned
to burn Everett and kill Sheriff
McKae, w.>s communicated to
Mayor Merrill, he declared Mon
day
"We were notified at 11 n. m.
Sunday that seven men had pledged
themselves to get the sheriff," he
said, "and that they had a quantity
of phosphorus on hand. Intending
to burn Kverett."
Two I'lnkerton detectives were
members of the 1. W. W. excursion
ists. One was wounded on the
scalp, according to the police.
Shooting Comca Quick
The exchange of shots followed
brief conversation between Sheriff
Mcltae and the men on the boat
as the steamer Verona was nosing
up to the dock, eye witnesses said
Here Is the story as told by May
or Merrill of ICveret':
"We knew the I. W. W.a were
coming, and the committee was
armed and waiting for them. When
the steamer approached the dock,
and before any lines were thrown
out, Sheriff McKae stepped out. He
asked for the leader, and said he
wanted to know what the party In
tended to do. There were 2C>O on
the boat, I understand
