BUSINESS MEN MOBILIZE
leaders of I. W. V. Declare Tliov
Win Brine Men from All parts or
the Country and Precipitate An
Industrial Revolution. .
SEATTLE, Nov. 6. Jeff
Beard, former sheriff of Sno
homish county, died of the
wounds received fighting the
Industrial Workers of the
World at Everett yesterday.
This makes a total of seven
dead. E. P. Buehrer, janitor
of the Everett high schpol is
dying.
I. W. W. leaders have plan
ned a charge of murder against
the Everett posse. Red Doran
declared he would bring men
from all parts of the country
and precipitate an "industrial
revolution" in Everett. A
hundred armed businessmen
are mobilized at Everett, ready
to guard the city.
Leaders wired Frank P.
Walsh of Kansas City, former
chairman of the federal indus
trial relations commission, ask
ing him to defend the arrested
members. They also wired an
appeal to W. D. Haywood of
Chicago, to come immediately
and asked that Haywood hire
able lawyers.
SHERIFF TELLS OF FIGHT.
EVERETT, Nov. 6. Sheriff
Dan McRae who was shot in
the leg described the I. W. W.
battle. He said, "Probably a
hundred and thirty five armed
deputies were at the dock and
others lined the shore. When!
the boat came close I yelled for
their leader. They replied
they were all leaders.' 1 told
them they could not land.
They began firing. Probably
fifteen shots came from the
boat before we replied. My
clothing was bullet riddled. 1
cannot understand how I es
caped without more serious in
juries." ,
I. W. W. WOULD BURN
EVERETT.
Mayor Merrill said the I. W.
W. intended to kill McRae and
burn Everett. They had pur
chased phosphorous in Port
land. Mrs. Edith Frenette was ar
rested when she attempted to
assault McRae when he was
wounded and being carried to
the hospital. The coroner is
dragging the waters around
the dock hunting for corpses
of rioters who fell overboard
after being wounded.
Mart When Root Arrives.
The battle was precipitated when
the steamboat Verona, which reached
Everett at :20 p. m, attempted to
tie up at the city wharf so aa to dis
charge her passengers. The line had
been thrown out, but aa It was about
to be made fast Sheriff McRae, a
force of many deputies and hundreds
of citliens, with seemingly one voice,
warned the vessel's officers and thoae
aboard that no one would be allowed
to com ashore.
Hardly had the warning: been giv
en when the battle began. Two shots
rang out In quick succession. Then
came a fualllade. Men began to drop
on the decks of the Verona and oa
the wharf. Borne say as many as !0(M
ahots were fired.

COUNTY CHAIRMEN
"Woodrow Wilson will carry Uma
tilla county tomorrow, despite the
heavy republican majority of tin'
county. From Information received
! from all sections of the county, I feel
safe In predicting that the presidet l
will receive a majority of 350 when
the count Is completed. There will
be no defections in the democratic
party and Wilson will receive many
votes from the progressive faction of
the republican party. I also feel sa'e
in predicting that Oregon will be
found In the Wilson column by a
good margin."

President Wilson's official fam-

387 electoral votes. Their op-
tlmism Is unrestrained. Wilson,
his friends and family receive
the returns at Shadow Lawn.
He goes to Washington on Sat-

NEW YORK, Nov. . Can-

Willcox. He receives the re-
turns at the Hotel Astor tele
phone from republican head-
quarters. He plans to vote early 4
NEW Y6RK, Nov. I Hughes con
cedes that Wilson will carry the solid
south. The democrats concede that
Hughes will carry Maine, New Hamp
shire. Vermont, Rhode Island, pena-
sylvanla and Iowa. The election '
probably depends on New York, Illi
nois, Indiana and Ohio.
There are eight hundred thousand
new women voters in Illinois. Poli
ticians are unable to predict how
they will vote. Republicans are fac
ing a big problem in keeping down
New York city's normal democratic
majority and. boost ng the normal up
state republican majority. The re
publicans claim New York by a hun
dred thousand. The democrats claim
the same majority.
New York betting still favors
Hughes, ten to eight.
On account of the heavy Illinois
registration officials do not expect to
complete tabulation until Wednesday
noon.
