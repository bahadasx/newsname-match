No. 1. Exaggeration
Men whose opinions are effective are men of modera
tion. Instinct discounts superlatives. And the discount often
goes too far to the article's injustice.
Adjectives callous credulity.
Blatancy does not command respect
Over-statement, in reaction, creates commensurate re
sistance. Some things may be the best of their kind in the world.
But it is pretty hard for finite minds to know it And
harder still for cynical minds to believe it.
Modesty, by its very rarity, commands attention. And
by its fascination wins.
Too much effort makes men think that your selling task
is hard.
Remember how the expression "Morgan & Wright Tires
are Good Tires" stood out amidst the bombast of its time.
What advertising phrase was ever more effective than
the simple words "It Floats".'

Constable C. L. Baker and Deputy
Morehead Raid Gambling Game
and Arrest Six Negroes.
The Joyous sport of a bunch of aix
"coons," who were leisurely employed
Saturday night about 1 o'clock In
dealing monte, was abruptly stopped
when Constable C. L. Baker and Dep
uty Sheriff Morehead rapped on the
door and a faint voice from within
suld, "Who's dat?" With the dim
light quickly extinguished, the door
was set ajar by the "big man" bank
ing the game and the two representa
tives of the law flashed their lights
into the frightened faces of the six
would-be winners and ordered them to
hoist their bauds. This request was
quickly complied with and the even
half dozen gamblers were coupled to
gether and marched to the county jail.
Pleas and promises were made, but
the law had lost its sympathetic feel
ing and the march was continued.
This Is the third raid these gentle
men have made within the past two
weeks, each time bagging a nice
crowd, the last raid bringing the total
up to fourteen. Constable Baker, In
speaking of the prevalence of gam
bling in Bryan, said that as long as It
was against the law to gamble In
Brazos county and be was an officer,
he was going to corral the offenders
and stop the violations.
