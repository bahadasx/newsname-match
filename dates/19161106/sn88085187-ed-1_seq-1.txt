SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 6.—
That Capt. Fred Jebsen, formerly
of Tacoma, is alive and is now at
work in China on some mission
for the kaiser, is the report cir
culated today regarding the mari
ner, whose history since the be
ginning of the war reads like a
boy's adventure story.
Newr to this effect is said to
have reached the German con
sulate here, and the British and
Japanese secret service by dif
ferent sources, and the activities
of the allied agents among friends
of Jebses caused the story to
gain circulation.
Jebsen is said to have delivered
coal to a German squadron in the
Pacific early in the war.

DEMOCRATS KICK AT
SYSTEM OF COUNTING
J. Charles Dennis, chairman of
the democratic central commit

election judges and inspectors
Monday, telling them to "follow
the law" on the question of
counting the ballots and not the
instructions issued by County-
Auditor Morris.
Morris' instructions were to
count first of all the vote for
president, U. S. senator, congress
man and governor, and phone In

initiative measures 18 and 24,

Be sure to vote against these separately, 10 "no" votes in all.

Hoxie, Joseph A. Sloan and Edwin M. Conner. (If you happen

On state offices The Times expresses no preferences except
the following:
For lieutenant governor—Vote for Thomas Lally, democrat.
His opponent, Louis F. Hart, is an enemy of the initiative, refer

Those who vote against the referendums should vote against him.
For secretary of state —Vote for J. M. Tadlock, democrat. It
is highly desirable to defeat I. M. Howell, republican incumbent.

Mabel Abbott Hears I.W.W. Riot
Harangue; Seattle Is Untroubled
I attended an I. W. W. street
meeting ln Seattle Sunday nlgnt,
two hours after the dead, wound
ed and prisoners had l*e<*n taken
from the boats when they re
turned from Everett.
The downtown streets had the
usual bright quietness of Sunday
night.
Newsboys were calling extras,
"All About Many Killed and
Wounded in 1. W. W. Riot at
Everett!"
There was absolutely nothing
else to hint at the strange pre-***-'™*r
sion that had passed through
those same streets two hours be
fore—police with drawn revol
vers, national guardsmen and na
val militiamen with guns, and
citizens with holsters belted
clumsily outside their overcoats,
inarching the sullen-faced squads
of returning I. VV. W.s to the city
and county jails, while ambul
ances sped up the hills to he hos
pitals and the morgue.
Fleet lon Talk Mostly.
From Pioneer Square, peaceful
and brilliant under the strings of
lights radiating from th* in', i
Pole, we went southward toward
the part of the city where, If any
where, traces of trouble out-lit to
he visible.
The streets were as quiet as
those north of Yesler.
Grojips of roughly dressed men
lounged on the corners. The
scraps of their talk that reached
us were mostly of the election.
There was nothing to see or
hear but the mechanical pianos
blaring and battering away be
hind the gaudy billboards of the
cheap movies, and the Salvation
Army wended Its nightly way
northward.
Nothing, until we turned from
First avenue to Washington st.
Then we saw a black line ex
tending across the street at Occi
dental —a crowd listening «.o a
street speaker.
"Our Brave Hoys."
It filled the street from one
curb to the other and extended
nearly half way down the block.
A banner bobbing in the thick
est of it, announced, "Meeting at
I. W. W. Hall Tonight."
The speaker stood only a little
above the level of the crowd, and
only those in front of liim could
hear all he said; but serapH of
his oratory floated to the curb
stone from time to time, and the
crowd pressed closer and stayed
on.

their lives for freedom at Everstt

For superior court judge—Vote FOR C. M. Eastcrdav, in
cumbent, and John D. Fletcher. Vote AGAINST M. L. Clifford,
incumbent, the choice of the corporation lawyers.
On county offices The Times makes only these recommenda
tions:
For sheriff—Vote for John Griffith, democrat. His opponent,
Robert Longmire, incumbent, is a do-nothing official.
For prosecuting attorney—Vote for Fred Remann, republi
can. He has been a fairly faithful official. His opponent, in the
opinion of The Times, entirely lackg the calibre necessary to fill
the office.
• • • •
In the legislative fights The Times has these preferences:
For state senator, 27th district —Vote for Walter S. Davis, re
publican. He was the only member of the Pierce county delega
tion two years ago who had a thoroughly good record.
For representative, 36th district—Vote AGAINST Guy E.
Kelly, republican. W. V. Burrill, democrat, is a clean, worthy
candidate. Kelly was a leader in the last session and as * such
helped "put across" some of the worst bills in the state's history.
For representative, 37th district — Vote AGAINST J. H.
Davis, republican, for the same reason as in Kelly's case.

The steamer trip to Everett had
