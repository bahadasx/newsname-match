FOUR MILLION
VOTING WOMEN
CAUSE GUESSING
(By United Press)
New York, Nov. 6.Four million
women vote tomorrow.
And, both sides say frankly that
it's difficult to say just what they'll
do, inasmuch as the women will be
more independent than men.
"They will not follow their hus
bands, brothers or sweethearts," said
the Republican national committee
woman's branch today. "They'll be
independent, but we believe the ma
jority will be for Hughes. They haVe
more hope for their cause in the elec
tion of Hughes."
On the other hand, the Democratic
woman's section said:
"We feel that the larger portion
of the women's vote will go to Wil
son. We contend that questions af
fecting men are equally as vital to
women. And, we believe that women
will not let the suffrage question en
ter into consideration. If they do,
they will have a better chance with
Wilson than with Hughes/'
Illinois will poll the largest wo
men's vote, as there are about 800,-
000 women eligible to ballot there.
The states in the suffrage column are
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho,
Washington, California, Oregon, Ari
zona, Kansas, Illinois, Montana and
Nevada.
West Virginia and South Dakota
vote on whether to admit women to
suffrage.

JOHN BARLEYCORN
STRUGGLES FORLIFE
IN SEVEN STATES
(By United Press)
New York, Nov. 6.Prohibition is
a hot issue in seven states tomorrow
California, Montana, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Michigan and Arisona.
In Idaho the proposition is whether
the electors shall make prohibition a
part of the constitution. It now has
drouth by .statute.
California has two proposalsthe
first to close saloons and stop club
liquor selling effective in 1918 the
other, total prohibition (including
manufacture) effective in 1920. This
fight is bitter on account of Califor
nia's wine industry. The drys say the
first proposti Is likely to be adopted.
Montana votes on a referendum
prohibitory statute.
South Dakota with 400 dry towns
against 92 wets, votes on state-wide
prohibition.
The Michigan fight is important in
view of the fact that it is an indus^
trial state, whereas the larger in
dustrial centers have heretofore been
wet.

Four Hundred and Thirty-six Mem-

Elected,
(By United Press)
Washington, D. C, Nov. 6.Tomor-
row 18,000,000 citizens of the United
States will select the 29th president
and vice president of the republic.
Although there are five national
tickets in the field and one lone vice
presidential aspirant, it is certain
that only two of these tickets will fig
ure very largely in the vote counting.
The 29th president, therefore, will
be either Woodrow Wilson or Charles
Evan Hughesthe first a Democrat,
the second, a Republican.
The unsuccessful ones will be:
SocialistFor president: Allan L.
Benson of New York, and, for vice
president, George R. Kirkpatrick of
New Jersey.
Prohibition 1stJ. Frank Hanly of
Indiana and Ira Lambrith of Massa

Louisiana, vice presidential candi
date.
60 in Senate Race.
While the presidential and vice
presidential candidate? are strug
gling for supremacy, 68 men are
seeking election to the United States
senate in a vote getting race of
scarcely less importance. There are
35 vacancies to be filled in the up
per house of the national legislature.
Regardless of which side is success
ful in the presidential race, they
must elect senators to hold majority
in the upper house if they expect to
put through their legislation. The
Democrats are now in the majority.
The G. O. P. has set out to elect ten
Republican senators out of the 35
to be chosen, and Republican chief
tains tomorrow will scan with con
siderable anxiety the popular vote for
senator in the 33 states where the
people are expressing their will on
these candidates.
Next to the senatorial race in im
portance, comes the voting for con
gressional nominees.
There are 436 members of the
lower house to be elected, not count
ing territorial delegates. The pres
ent house of representatives shows a
working majority for the Democrats
of 23 votescounting 197 Republi
cans, Progressives, one independent
and one Socialist as the minority,
against 229 Democrats.
Republicans hope to sweep this ma
jority into the discard.
Briefly summarized, the two great
parties will stand tomorrow for these
great issuesand in this list are
given only the outstanding issues:
DEMOCRATS"Wilson kept us
out of war."
A vote for Republicans is a vote
for war.
Wilson stands for peace with
honor and prosperity.
The tariff for revenue policy has
proved its entire workableness.
REPUBLICANSWeakuess of the
administration's Mexican policy.
Warning of the chaos which will
come after the European war, if the
Democratic tariff is maintained, and
Europe dumps her goods here in the
race for commercial supremacy.
"False prosperity" due to the Euro
pean war.
The "surrender to force" indicated
in pasteage of the Adamson eight
hour railroad bill.
Broken promises by Democracy as
to protection of American citizens
abroad reduction of the cost of liv
ingtand as to economy and efficiency.
Watch Progressives,
Of most importance, in the minds
of the leaders of the two great par
ties, is the swing which the Progres
sive vote of four years* ago will take
tomorrow.
Of the trifle under 16,000,000 of
popular votes cast in 1912, nearly 5,-
000,000 were for Roosevelt and
Johnson, running on the "third tick
et" under the Progressive emblem.
That five million of votes, deli|*red
in one block, would be sufficient, itj
