1 ODDS FADE
1 Two explanations are offered for
tilts,) condition. Tho Democrats say
tho conlldcnco In tho re-election of
Wilson brought Into tho betting mar
ket such largo sums of money that
tho odds wero legitimately forced to
their natural level. Wall Street of
fers nnothar solution of tho drop of
three points.
Tho Wall Streot explanation Is that
tho professional speculators bcllovo
that if Hughes Is elected tho market
will open Wednesday morning with
everything on tho list from 5 to 20
polnt.t up, and that Wednesday's mar
ket will mark tbo greatest boom in
slocks in history. Acting on that bo-
llef, Wall Streot claims, tho speculat
ors proceeded to load up to-day with
tho stocks they fanaled In anticipa
tion of tho rise following Republican
success. i
Then, to play safe, they went out
and bet on Wilson, anticipating that
oven though they lose the Wilson bets
the rise In the market will win them
out, and It Wilson Is elected they
win tho Wilson beta and offset any
probable loss on a slump resulting
from Democratic success.
Wall Btrcet, however, does not look
for any great market disturbance if
Wilson Is elected.
WIL80N MAY BE FAVORITE IN
TO-NIQHT'S BETTING.
The outstanding fact Is that Wilson
goes to the polls an even money
choice In tho Wall Street betUng,
and he may bo the favorite In the
Waldorf-Astoria and uptown bra
kerano office betting to-night.
If there was any advantage to the
Republican Party in the news spread
broadcast through tbe country Satur
day that Hughes was a 10 to 7 favor
Ito it was effectually discounted by
tho developments of to-day.
Immense sums were bet on the elec
tion tn the last hour of trading, aomo
Stock Exchange firms devoting their
whole stalls to handling beta on the
Curb.
About 50,000 was bet In the first
hour. By that time the odds had
tightened up. Wilson Commissioners
offered S to 10 at noon and this
brought out somo Hughes money.
A well known commissioner ap
peared on tho curb In tha early
afternoon literally loaded with
brlnht new bills of la roe denom
inations. He offered to bet WOO
to $1,000, $8,000 to $10,000 or
$80,000 to $100,000 on Wilson and
couldn't act a peep. It was re
