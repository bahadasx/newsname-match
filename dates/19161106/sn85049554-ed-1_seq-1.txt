American Engineer
Relates Experiences
With German "Sub"
New York, Nov. 6.—"I have been a
marine engineer since 1881, but never
have 1 gone thru such an ordeal as
one which a German submarine put on

arrived here.litat night from Liverpool

Mr. Smith declared he was forced to

steamer -Midland, on promises of good
pay, for a Journey to China! and that
the ship wonllhnot enter the war aone.
Off St Lucia, he learned that tho
Steamer was Iwtind for Vladivostok.
"After loading at the Siberian port
we went to Australia, where we loaded
grain for Havrp," said Mr. Smith. "At
6:80 p.
on Oot. 20 we were halted

found they had come froim a subma

had.ji crew of thirty-three, eight of us
white men and the others Lascars. I
was the Only American on board.
"We were ordered to the llfertJoata,
eighteen going in one and the rest of
the crew in the other. The German
-commander forced us to come aboard
the submarine., He put some of his
crew Into our boat and they went out
to the -Midland and sank her, After
four explosions we saw her dark hull
roll over and go, down.
"The Germans used only one Eng
lish expression when they returned to
the submarine after sinking the Mid
land, and thflit was 'Get out'. We
drifted fbruout ^he night until at day
break a French trawler picked us up
and kept us aboard for two days. La

G. O. P. CHAIRMEN
ACCUSES DEMOCRATS
Rawson Says Artiole Was Inspired by
Des rfeinss Politicians in Effort to
Injure Entire Ticket, While Meredith
Managers Ridieule Rawson's State
ment and Harding Blames Des
Moines Register.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Nov. 6.—The editorial
endorsement of Harding by Midas Cri
terion, a liquor dealers' trade journal
published In Chicago, is the. bone of con
tention between the republican and
democratic committees today and tele
grams are bet/ig rushed to the dally
press pro and con.
Harding, himself, has accused the DeB
Moines Register of Inspiring tbe pub
lication while State Republican Chair
man Rawson lays it at the door of the
democratic organization. He admits
that there is such a liquor journal and
says that he does not deny that the 11-'
quor journal endorsed Harding and
urged liquor dealers to dig deep for
Harding's clcctlon but he claims that
the article was Inspired from Dfes
Moines.
He wired today a statement in part
ft* #nl1nwaif
"I am not questioning that there la
such a liquor journal as Midas Crite
rion. I do not deny that such an article
as was published In the Register may
have appeared in its columns. I do
deny, however, that that article was
published out of friendliness for W. L.
Harding, the republican nominee for
governor, and 1 assert most emphatical
ly that It has Its inspiration in a dem
ocratic source and for the purpose of
furnishing campaign material to bolster
up charges which opposition newspa
pers have .been unable to convince the
voters of the state are true to Mr. Hard
ing. Had the author of the article
given it a less Intimate touch It might
have been more convincing, but when
he gave that editor a knowledge of the
geography of Des Moines which extend
ed even to' the relative locations of the
Iowa Homestead and Successful Farm
ing plants, the scheme ran close enough
to the_*Hiwace to make its authorship
apparent. 4he article pretended to 1am
bout Mr, #«Matth. feii^ggp&:.can:
dldate for governor, yet tpe author
could not refrain from boasting that Mr.
Meredith has the greatest agricultural
magazine in the world. It pretended to
boost James M. Pierce for his work in
behalf of the liquor interests, yet the
author could, not restrain hlniself to the
extent of giving Mr. Pierce's publica
tions tho wide circulation which they
have thruout the middle west, but con
fined his subscription list to the borders
of Iowa.
"It was a grand hoax, planned and
executed within the democratic party,
or by its aids, as an eleventh hour shot
which they bolleved we would not have
time to discredit before election day.
The leader* of democracy believed that
they could sweep their party into power
In Iowa hy tlelng one of their dis
reputable stool pigeons to the wheels
of the republican party. The stool
pigeon had no alternative but to obey
the orders of the democratic master he
has always served.
"Let me say In addition that the re
publican party In Iowa Is standing upon
tbe platform* adopted at the state con
vention. It has no connection of any
nature with the liquor Interests and
not one cent of liquor money or cor
poration money has been received or
expended for the election of the repub
lican ticket."
Prominent Liquor Journal.
The committee managing Meredith's
campaign has telegraphed a statement
ridiculing Rawson and Harding for not
getting together on their replies. Hard
ing had stated In his speeches In Poca
hontas county that he had wired his
.Chicago representative and had been
informed that the Des Moines Register
had obtained publication of the articlo
In question. Whereas Rawson's state
ment accuses the democratic organiza
tion. Both Rawson and Harding admit
that the liquor dealers' trade journal
did boost for Harding editorially as
quoted first in the Des 'Moines Capital
and later in the Register and otMor
newspapers.
Midas Criterion is listed In the Amer
ican Newspaper Annual as a liquor
dealers' trade Journal published in "Chi
cago. It subscription price Is 6 per
yea# and its advertising rate $866 pe«
page. The Issue containing the editor
ial boosting for Harding, urging liquor
dealers to dig deep for his election and
ackuowledging that liquor dealers owe
tho publisher of the Iowa Homestead a
debt for his assistance to them also
contained f02 pages .of about the size
of the Saturday Evening Post Fifty
nine pages w«re filled with advertise
mentf of 128 different brands of boose
which at the feuhllshed rate of 9866 per
page w°wfd amount to S6U134 adver
tising recelpty for a year's business. The
Meredith committee thinks It ridiculous
for Harding or Rawson to assert that
such a publication could be worked by
anybody except the liquor interests to
publish an editorial .in which Its own
publishers did not believe.
