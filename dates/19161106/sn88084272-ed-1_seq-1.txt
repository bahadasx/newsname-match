Exercise Your Right;
Go To Polls and Vole
The B. F. Goodrich Company has
taken the initiative among the large
American industries In appealing to
its empolyes to cast their ballot.
The appeal is so strong, so ap
plicable to every American citizen,
that it is herewith reproduced:
The right to vote is power. The
right to vote is the emblem of pro
tection. The right to vote is the
instrument that goes with, and
makes for. freedom.
It's the thing that marks the line
between freedom and slavery; be
tween liberty and despotism; be
tween equality and caste. It's the
thing that makes the American citi
zen his own king.
The citizen who doesn't vote is
not necessarily unpatriotic. He is
not necessarily disloyal. He is not
necessarily ungrateful.
The simple fact is that he's asleep.
He's slumbering on his rights. He's
not using his club of protection.
He's the sentry who doesn't watch.
He's the riant who fritters his
strength. He's the soldier won
loiters in the rear. He's the freed
man who forgets the slavery of his
forebears.
If somebody tried to deny you the
right to cast your ballot, you'd fight
with the strength of a lion. And
you'd recall, meantime, that suf
frage is sanctified by human blood.
"Eternal Vigilance Is the Price of
Liberty. Vigilance means think
ing, reading, inquiring, learning,
voting. The time yon spend that
way is never wasted.
An election is here. It's not the
time to shirk or quibble it's the
time to think and vote.
Let's all be real citizens!
Let's have our say!
Let's exercise our power!

W
ARSAW, Poland, Nov. 5. (Via
London, Eng, Nov. 6.) The
manifesto of emperor William
of Germany and emperor Francis
Joteph of Austria-Hungary, again call

dom of Poland, was read at noon today
to the assmbled Polish representatives
in the royal palace by Gov. Gen. von
Beeeler.
Outside, in the great square before

inhabitants of the old Polish
capital gathered by thousands to at

hearing of which are making their way
into the minds of the people more or
ls rapidly after its long sleep of more

Quickest to realize the significance
of the day is the academic youth of
the country, students of the University
of Warsaw, the Polytechnic school and
other institutions of learning, who at
tended the ceremony in corporate ""
student ribbons. This afternoon thy

President Brudzinski. who was in plain
civilian attire, without decorations,
seemed to represent the spirit, not of
the ancient Poland and the Polish

Gen. von Beseler replied in crisp,

of fulfillment of the long cherished
Polish wish for reestablshmnt of the

By Emotion, Conformity, and
PERSHING TO GD
Army on the Border Hears That President to Take New
Stand Towards Mexico if Elected and Banditry
Keeps Up; If Railroad Is to Be Built by Persh
ing, It Means This to a Certainty.
M1
ILITARY officers, particularly
national guardsmen, who have
been excited for two days over
reports that Gen. John J. Pershing has
tentative orders to "go after Villa" and
stay after him until he is caught, he
came further excited by the presence
here of Brig. Gen. William Croxler,
chief of ordnance of the United States
army.
The presence of Gen. Crozier here so
closely following the visit of Lieut.
Col. C. B. Baker, chief of the army
transportation service, who with J. G.
Rogers president of the American Rail
way association and general superin
tendent of the Pennsylvania lines, has
gone south to visit Gen. Pershing,
caused a good deal of speculation. The
report is out that the visit of CoL
Baker and Mr. Rogers has to do with
plans for constructing a railroad from
Columbus to Gen. Pershing's ba:e. for
the transportation of supplies, motor
trucks with flanged wheels to be used
as the means of locomotion.
Can Mean Only One Thing.
If this Is true, officers argue, it tan
mean but one thing that the stay of
Pershing in Mexico Is to be prolonged
and that he is to require more sup
plies than he is using now. With the
rainy season over and the prospects
good for good roads for at least an
other nine months, military men say
that any steps to construct a tram
way to the Pershing tase can mean
nothing more than further and more
extensive military operations in Mexico.
This transportation talk, taken with
the persistent border report that presi
dent Wilson, convinced of the inability
of Carranza to handle the bandit sit
uation satisfactorily, has derided to
' 'yioan -ur" northern Hevii-n ft once
there is something behind ft all.

penalty restored to the railroads the
use of the injunction, the right to fine

refuse to obey the court's ruling by
in any way interfering with interstate
traffic, and many other features which
will come to light later on. My per
sona opinion is that a special conven

of the Adamson law and get out of

tfTEfl VILLA
If ISM IS ELECTED?
garding further American activities is
that in the event of a Republican vic
tory, president Wilson intends to let
matters rest as they are. to muddle
themselves still more for the new ad
ministration to take bold, but that If
he Is elected, he will not hesitate to
order immediate "pacification" of
northern Mexico by American treops.
The "he has kept us out of war" talk
will not count for anything after the
votes have been cast, it is argued, and
the president will carry forward the
campaign against Villa and other ban
dits, regardless of consequences.
If WHon I Elected.
Except for this campaign, some of
the officers say. the president would
some time ago have told Pershing to
resume activities. Democratic officers
here, with supposed "underground"
news sources, assert that the president,
if elected, will at once assume an en
tirely different attitude towards the
Mexicans; that he has followed an in
