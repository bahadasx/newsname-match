The Btatcmenff-xarricd in.- rcportB

'"During war time It is impossible to

ENGLAND'S NOTE GETS
SARCASTIC REPLY
Mexican Minister Tells Eng
land to Herd German Sub
marines at Home
Mexico City, Nov. 0 Foreign Min
ister Aguilar replied to Great Britain's
demands that Mexican neutrality be
rigorously enforced as regards the Ger
man submarine believed to be operating
in territorial wators of the southern re
public. The British note, sent through Secre
tary of State Lansing and warning
against aid of 'assistance being afford
ed the Teuton submarine, created
strongly unfavorable feeling, which ex
pressed itself in Aguilar 's reply.
The Carranza foreign minister first
pointed out that he failed to Bee"why
the British noto should have been scut
through the United IStnteB department
instead of direct to the Mexican foreign
office. He declared Mexican neutral
ity would bo enforced, but pointed out
thut Mexico could no more be held re
sponsible for Gorman submarine opera
tions off her coasts than could the Uni
ted (States be held responsible for the
recent activities of the U-53 off Nan
t'.cket after that undersea fighter had
entered an Amorican port. The reply,
with thinly veiled sarcasm, suggests
that the best way to assure continued
friendly relations between the two gov
ernments is for the British fleet to pre
vent German submarines from leaving
their bases, thus eliminating any chance
for disagreement.
The Carranza foreign office, Aguilar
declares, will, however, permit no viola
tion of its neutrality by any warships
o" the belligerent nations.

Spanish Refugee, Says They
All Escaped Before Parral
Was Taken
OTHER RUMORS SAY TWO
WERE CAUGHT AND SHOT
General Trevino Wires He Can
Learn Nothing (Concern
ing Parral
El Paso, Texas, Nov. 0. Every en
ergy of the Uuitod States state depart
ment is today being directed toward ob
taining knowledge of the fat of the 10
Americans known to be in Parral and
apprehension was roused to fever heat
upon the arrival last nieht of four Am
ericans, who fled from Chihuahua bring
ing further reports of the murder of
Dr. C. II. Fisher, seed American 'in
Santa Rosalia, by Villista bandits.
After hunting down and killing Dr.
Fisher, the bandits told the inhabitants
of tbe town they were "going to Par
ral and kill those gringoes," natives
reaching Chihuahua City after the raid
told the refugees. In official quarters
here hope is held out that the Americans
were able to escape before the bandits
rached Parral. Representatives of min
ing companies employinfg some of the
men declare their belief that the men
are safe but admit their anxiety has
been awroused by the lack of news-
In u message to the United Press,
General Trevino, commander of the
Mexican de facto garrison at Chihuahua,
City, stated he was unable to obtain
any news of the fate of the Ameri
cans. "Communication still cut off,"
said the telegram from Hrevino, "and
have no information f rdm Parral. Malc-
ng efforts to get news."
On the same train bringine the Amer
ican refugees last night were tho famil
ies of two staff ofticors of Trevino and
the families of seven French resident
of the Chihuahua capltnl leaving thcra
in fenr that Villa will next attack that
city. They crossed to the American lids
of the rivor. Every foreigner coming
out predicts that the city will be evaeu-
tei it villa makes another attack.
W. E. Phillips, secretary of the T.
M. C. A- of Chihuahua City, was ons
of tho refugees.'
"It is almost ceretain Fisher -was
killed," he saidl. "A well known na
tive cattleman who came overland
rom Santa Rosalia declared that the
doctor hid when the bandits entered tho
town. I'pon orders of the Villista com-:
ntundiT ha was hunted down and stub
bed to death. ,
In Chihuahua City it is believed
Parral is in possession of Villa but ws
heard nothing of the fate of the Amer
icans," said Dr. Phillips.
Other refugees said that artillery on
the hills back of Chihuahua City had
been hauled down yesterday and loaded
upon flat cars. This was taken as an in
dications that evacuation was imminent.
That another American was murdered
in Santa Rosalia was the statement of
Dr. W. V, Jackson of El Paso, last
night. He declared that an influential
Mexican who arrived here brought in
formation that Harry Brensham, mining
prospector, was caught by bandits after
Fisher's murder and shot to death. Dr.
Jackson Baid the report had been
brought in by a messenger tent to San
ta Rosalia by his informant after tho
raid, but would not divulge bis name.
