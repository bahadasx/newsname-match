bers of the club sprung a surprise at
the end of the program on Miss Helen
Park, who is secretary of the club
and whose marriage to Mr. II. V.
Cooksey; is to take place the latter
part of this month.
A most interesting program was en
joyed. Among other things there was
solo by Miss Park, and just as Mrs.
J. M. Irvin was finishing an exquisite
piano solo, the gifts were brought in
and piled on a table by the side of the
bride-to-be, with a pretty little speech
from Mrs. G. D. Edwards, the presi
dent. There were "dainty and useful
gifts from different members of the
clubhand a set cf solid silver spoons
was presented by the "club as a whole,
Mrs. E. T. Bowman in her usual sweet
manner reading the" following verse of
her own composition:
A gift of silver teaspoons
From the Crystal Music Club;
We guarantee the silver a
From these rpcons shall not rub.
As they adorn the table .
Of Mr. Cooksey's fair bride,
And both enjoy the dainties
; She prepares with skill and pride.
They will recall in using
And always keep fresh in mind,
Friends of Crystal Music Club,
So generous and so kind.
And midst the shade and sunshine
As they journey on through life,
May health, plenty, love and joy
Attend this young man and wife.
After the shower delicious hot choc
olate and pimento sandwiches were
served. The club met at the home of
Mrs. Minnie Mitchell on this happy

One of .the Duties of Our Govern
ment is to Rescue Rash Volun
teers from the Yortex of
the World War
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 6. Of the many
unexpected duties the United States
has found thrust upon it by the world
war one of the strangest is that of
rescuing adventurous boys who enlist
in the European armies.
There have been more than a thou
sand such cases since the war be
gan, and even now letters praying for
the release of young soldiers of for
tune v pour into the state department
at the rate of 50 a day. It has been
necessary to assign an official to give
special attention to the subject.
The story almost always is' the
same, l he youngster, generally be
tween sixteen and twenty, suddenly
disappears and is next heard from
when he writes home from Canada or
England that he has had enough of
war and wants to come home.
Then follows an almost tornado
like correspondence in which officials,
parents, congressmen and persons who
think they can hurry the processes of
diplomacy by their influence become
sympathetic, tearful, importunate or
mandatory. The red tape of govern
ment business, however, unwinds
slowly and finally the consul general
in London or Ottawa, or somewhere
else or perhaps the American embas
sy makes representations to the for
eign government and the adventurer
is released and sent home. :
Until recently the British govern
ment has been promptly releasing all
Americans under 21 on the request of
the United States government on the
ground that it is illegal for such a
person to enlist in a foreign army
without parents consent. Recently the
British government has shown a dis
position to reduce the age limit to
eighteen when minors become of age
in a military sense.
and seated on the veranda where they
were treated to graphophone music.
When all had arrived the honoree was
led into the beautifully decorated par
lor, followed by the guests, all eager
to see the gifts that were heaped on
a table in one end of the room. Miss
Park opened and read the cards and
all admired the lovely gifts which
were numerous and handsome. Much
merriment was caused by the naive re
marks of little Miss Gretchen Van
Roy, a tiny three-year-old guest, as
she watched the packages unwrapped.
After the gifts had been duly ad
mired and the little bride-to-be had
thanked each one for being so lovely
to her, the guests were invited into the
hall where Miss Lucile Park presided
over the punch bowl and the gliests
were served delicious punch and waf
ers. Altogether it was one of the
most beautiful occasions of Crystal
River's social calendar.

Six Killed and Fifty Wounded in a
Scrap Near Seattle
Sunday
(Associated Press)
Everett, Wash., Nov. 6. At least
five men were killed 'and forty others
were , wounded yesterday in a fight at
the Everett city wharf between 250
members of the " Industrial a Workers
of the World, who came here from
Seattle on the steamer Verona, and a
posse of 50 citizens, headed by Sher
in uon ivicrtae. sneriir Mcnae is
among the seriously wounded.
LIST HAS LENGTHENED
Seattle, Nov. 6. Two detectives
j who were aboard the steamer Verona
yesterday when Industrial Workers of
the World fought a battle with a
posse of citizens on the shore, today
declared they could identify the In
dustrial Workers' leaders. One said
he had photographs of men firing
shots from the boat. Six persons were.
killed, including one posseman, and
fifty wounded. The police here have
arrested 297 Industrial Workers.
SOLDIERS IN FINE
CONDITION AND SPIRITS
In a letter to the Star, Corporal
Blalock of Company A says: ,
Laredo, Texas, Nov. 1. There are
104 men in our company now, all in
fine spirits, and all getting so tough
ened and sunburned that when we re
turn we will look like real cowboys,
minus the "chaps."
All of the Florida regiment except
two or three companies was moved
from the main camp down to the
water's edge of the silvery Rio Grande
yesterday, and are strung along its
edges in dog tents, awaiting develop
ments on the other side. Our com
pany is all packed up and ready to go
as soon as they can find a place large
enough for the largest, and we think,
the best company in the """Fighting
Florida Bunch," as the regulars call
us out here.
Since being on the border our com
pany has not had a man to fall out on
a hike, nor a man in the guard house,
and very few on the sick list, for
which showing the boys feel justly
proud.
We all lined up this morning and
signed the pay roll, and hope it will
not take but a few days to give ns the
"kale" so we can. send mementoes
and pay postage on letters to our
friends in Florida, the land of flowers.

TROUBLE
IN DUVAL COUNTY
Mr. Knott Will Beat Him in Jackson
ville by a Large
Majority
Jacksonville," Nov. 6. The demo
cratic campaign will be brought to a
close here tonight by a number of big
street rallies and addresses. These
meetings will be addressed by Con
gressman aears ana several promi
nent local speakers. The Democratic
Club of Duval county has arranged
for these meetings in the different
sections of the city, and intends to
alternate the speakers and send them
around to the various meetings.
The Catts supporters in Duva
county , have given up all hope of car
rying the county, and concede now
that Mr. Knott will carry Duval coun
ty by 1000 to 12000 majority. The
Democratic Club is claiming that he
will carry it by & majority of 2500
and it may possibly reach 3000.
. George M. Powell, the recognized
attorney and lobbyist for the race
track . interests, and also "Curley
Brown," the owner of the old race
track here, have come out openly in
support of Mr. Catts. Mr. Powell was
in Tallahassee during the last session
of the legislature attempting to get a
modified race track bill through. The
prohibitionists here have deserted Mr,
Catts. They, have gained knowledge
of the fact that the whisky clubs in
Jacksonville have contributed largely
to his campaign 'fund. It has been
rumored here for, some time that the
liquor people have been contributing
to the expenses OfMr. Catts cam
paign, but this rumor was not taken
seriously until the fact became gen
erally known that Mr. Catts had
ceased referring to the whisky traffic
in his speeches. -Several of the min
isters and othere interested in the
prohibition cause took the pains to in
vestigate this rumor and found that
it was founded on facts. When r the
screen was moved from behind which
Gus Miller had been hiding he came
out openly and boldly in support of
Mr. Catts. - .
Sentiment here is overwhelmingly
against the racing track interest, and
many good people supporting Mr.
Catts have turned from him to Mr.
Knott. The fact that Mr. Muller is
closely identified with Mr. Powell and
is a Catholic has caused a serious dis
ruption in the anti-Catholic forces
heretofore supporting Mr. Catts. The
fact that these men have come out
openly for Catts has caused the sin
cere prohibitiinists and church going
people who have heretofore supported
Mr. Catts to doubt his sincerity.
Billy Parker is openly assailing Mr.
Catts and is saying that he has double
crossed the Guardians of Liberty, and
a large advertisement appearing in
the Times-Union yesterday morning
stated Mr. Catts had turned down the
Guardians of Liberty after having
used them as long as he could to ad
vantage, and has taken up the liquor
and race track interests in a last at-,
tempt to be elected governor of Flor
ida. This disruption among the Guar
dians of Liberty and the fact that
Billy Parker is openly and strongly j
opposing Mr. Uatts will surely give
Dnval to Mr. Knott by a tremendous
majority.
Reports coming in from all sections
of the state to the democratic organ
ization indicate a rapid changing in
sentiment and the certain election of
Mr. Knott. Sentiment in West and
North Florida has changed to such
an extent during the past week that
many of the counties that gave Mr.
Catts a plurality in June will reverse
themselves and give substantial ma
jorities to Mr. Knott. Speakers re
por?t large and enthusiastic meetings
during the past week and a changing
in sentiment in all sections of the
state.
Mr. Knott will close his campaign
with a speech in Monticello this after
noon and Mr. Catts will close his cam
paign by a big .rally in DeFuniak
Springsboth sides having a large
number of meetings t scheduled in var
ious sections of the state. '

PERTINENT PARAGRAPHS
PERTAINING TO OUR PULPITS

At the Presbyterian Church . New York, Nov. 6.-President Wil-
The congregations yesterday a were son and Charles E. Hughes -spent to
somewhat larger than usual. At the day quietly recuneratin frnm tTiir
morning hour the roll of the church
was called and a gratifying number
answered "present." Rev. Hemdon
preached a wonderfully comforting
sermon on the topic: "The Bow in the
Cloud." He used the 9th chapter of
Genesis and the promise of God found
therein that the bow in the cloud
should be "for a token and a covenant
between me and, the earth." There
were two addttions to the church at
the morning service. -
Rev. R. T. Gillesbie of Florence, S.
C, preached at the evening hour. He
is the representative of Columbian
Theological Seminary. His was - a
splendid discourse on Matt. 1:21,
"And thou shall call his name Jesus."
He spoke of Jesus as the Savior in
this present world. The effectiveness
of the sermon was greatly added to by
a number of striking illustrations

,ut rather a present possession.
At the Baptist Church
Rev. Bunyan Stephens preached
both morning and evening to good
congregations. The number of Strang-
ers and visitors present was notice-
able. Mr. Stephens repeated yester-
day morning the sermon he preached
on Thursday at Flemington as an in-
troductory sermon for the Marion
aptist association. In this sermon
Mr. Stephens dwelt upon the largel
amount of time and effort put forth?
to satisfy the yearnings of the out-
ward man. The greater part of the
day is spent in sleeping, eating, rec-
reating and working to maintain the
outward man the temporal, tangible,
physical man. Even schooling, mental
equipment, higher culture are but ad-
vanced methods of making the out-
ward man more capable of earning a
better livelihood, increasing his pleas-
ures and beautifying his physicque.
He brought out, on the other hand,
he prayer of Paul for the Ephesians I
in pn. 3:i4-zu that tne "inward
man" might be strengthened with I
power through his spirit." Then,
"that Christ may dwell in your hearts j
through faith." This - indwelling of J
Christ was pointed out as being in J
he heart. Jesus begins at the foun-JThe
tain, cleansing the stream therefrom.
Also, that his dwelling within, repro-
duces himself m the life of the in-
dwelt. Tl.e other phase of the prayer
of Paul as broght out m this sermon
was "that ye may be filled unto all
the fulness of God." That is, "Our
natures possessed completely by the
energy of God and transformed com-
pletely into the likeness of Christ."
The fulness of Jesus was pointed out
in his words, works and manner of
life. The fulness of Jesus is com
municable. He gives himself to others.
He came that the people might have
life and "have it abundantly." His ful-
ress meets all human need. Being
wayward he restores, to God's favor;
tempted he overcomes weakness and
em; children of God he helps us to
live as becometh the children of God, J
