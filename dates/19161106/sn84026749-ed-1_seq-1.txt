TEN LIVES ARE IN PERIL
Rumor Has Part of General
Pershing's Expedition Gone
, to Protect U. S. Citizens.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Nov. 6.
Rumors were current hero to
day that part of General Persh
ing's expedition has been or
dered to Parral to protect Amer
ican interests there, following
capture of that city by Vlllistas.
There is no confirmation from
any source, however, and that
such a move is even contem
plated is denied by General Fun
ton. EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 6. Every
energy of the State Department to
day is being directed toward obtain
ing knowledge of the fate of the
ton Americans known to have been
In Parral.
Apprehension was roused to
fever heat upon the arrival last
night of four Americans who fled
from Chihuahua, bringing further
reports of the murder of Dr. C. H.
Fisher, aged American, in Santa
Rosalia by Villista bandits.
THREATEN GRINGOES.
After -hunting down and killing Pr.
Fisher, the bandits told the Inhabi
tants of the town they were "going to
Parral and kill those Grlngoes," natives
reaching Chihuahua city after the raid
told the refugees.
In official quarters here hopo Is held
out that the Americans were able to
eseapo before the bandits reached
Parral.
General Trevlno, commander of the
Mexican garrison at Chihuahua City,
said he was unable to obtain any news
of the fate of the Americans.
"Communication still cut off.' said
the telegram from Thevlno, "and havo
no information from Parral. Making
efforts to get news." -
On the same train bringing the Amer

Upon his return to the Capital, the
President will have before him the

man submarine attack on the British
horse transport Marina, with a loss
of five American lives.
An answer to this nation's questions

Tho old days when good weather
on election .day meant a big

Republican, would not drivo

over roads hub deep with mud.
If tho sun shono and the roads
wero dry it was different.
But now
Tho farmer "crankB up," picks up

FALL FROM BRIDGE
FATAL TO WOMAN
Miss Bessie M. Walker Plunges
Eighty Feet to Death in
Ravine.
Tho body of Miss Bessie M. Walker, of
1320 R street northwest, was found lying
In the ravine under the Connecticut ave
nue brjdgo this morning by a man walk
ing Ui rough, tho woods of Rock creek.
"An examination by Coroner Novltt dis
closed the fact that hor back and both
shoulder blades were broken, convincing
tho police that the woman fell or jumped
from the bridge.
Following an autopsy at the District
morgue, the coroner decided to give a
certificate of suicide.
William Walker, of 1320 R street,
whorfe name was found on a receipt
in the woman's handbag. Identified
the body as that of his daughter.
He told the police that she left home
about 4:30 o clock yesterday after
noon after eating a hearty dinner
to take a walk. Nothing more was
heard of her. he said.
Never Spoke of Suicide.
Questioned by the coroner, the
father said that hi daughter had
complained of pains In her head and
had occasionally shown signs of des
pondency. He added, however, that
ho had never heard her Intimate that
she would take her life.
Central Office Detectives Armstrong
and O'Brien, who hurried to the scene,
found a number of broken branches
on the thin trees just over tho spot
whero tho body was round, Indicating
that some huiky object had crashed
through them.
The fact that the woman was lying
flat on hor back and her clothes only
slightly disheveled at first led the
police to believe that she might havo
become 111 while walking through the
ravine.
Bones Broken By Fall.
Tho coroner's examination, however,
showed tho broken bones and other
signs of a violent fall. A small mir
ror In her handbag was smashed.
Miss Walker was forty-threo years
old. Her father said she was born In
New Hampshire, but had spent most
nt tlAr llfn fit tfAntcanl fn nnn inm
Ing to Washington from the latter
place about flvo years ago.
The distance from the top of the
bridge to the spot whero tho body was
found Is about eighty feet.

E
OF
Presidency Likely to fie Decided
in New York, Illinois, Ohio,
and Indiana.
HANDICAP WITH WILSON
NEW YORK. Nov. .-Tomorrow the
American voter says Who will be the
next President of the United States: dic
tates who will composo the Senate and
chooses members of tho House of Repre
sentatives. Viewing the situation today, twenty
four hours In advanco of the battle of
the ballots, and with claims fronvboth
Democrats and Republicans cocksuro of
victory, it appeared that the people iOf
Now York. Illinois, Ohio and Indiana
would come tho nearest to holding tho
balanco of power.
Both sides claim this "big four" of
States. Their total In tho Electoral
Collego Is llJ-nearly 43 per cent of tho
sGo votes necessary to a choice.
The strictest neutral or even th"
strongest Republican, for that matter
concedes the Democrats the "Solid
South" a block of 1SS voes. Thl I3S
comprises the electoral votes of Vir
ginia. North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi
Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee,
and Oklahoma.
Missouri and Kentucky Disputed.
It does not Include Missouri and Ken
tucky, heretofore' classified as com
ponent parts of the Solid South, and this
year claimed by Democrats still to be In
that section, but adjudged by Repub
licans to be debatable ground.
In the Presidential race, therefore.
Republican Candidate Hughes starts off
with his opponent given a handicap of
136 votes. But he also has been granted
by Democrats a handlcap-trom scratch
of seventy votesthe electoral total of
even States Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont. Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,
ft W rl T A af A
That leaves Wilson with a net liandl- '
cap In the vote race of sixty-six shares
In the Electoral College.
But unless there Is a cataclysm In the
voting tomorrow, the strictly neutral
admit that the 113 votes of the "big
four" will bo the real turning point In
the election. The Democrats claimed
all four today. So did the Republicans.
Illinois Real Enigma.
In Illinois lies the real enigma close
to the 800.000 new women voters. Be
cause they are new In their exercise of
tho franchise, and because they are
women, political prognostlcators wcro
exceedingly shy In making any pred c
tlons on the Sucker State today.
In New York-the State with the big
forty-flve of votes In the Electoral Col-
Ucge the problem the Republicans faced
was to keep tho New York city normal
Democratic majority down and boost up
the normal Republican up-State majority
to as high a point as possible.
Publicly, tho last minute claims on
both sldeH were: '
Republicans Hughes will win by ;
from loo.ooo to 160.000.
Democrats Wilson will win by nt
least 100.000.
Indiana and Ohio have been strenuous

. C. C. Elevators
Quit Running Again
"Coal Shortage" Stops Service and
Employes Climb Stairs Even
to Ninth Floor.
Elevatorsl That Is a word which.
If spoken before an employe of the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
will bring a heavy frown, Coal! That
is likely to bring a few hearty oaths.
For the I. C. C. elevators are to
stop running again today. Ono of
them Is already out of commission,
because of the "coal shortage." In
dications are that the other elevator
will cease to run shortly after noon,
and tho up-the-steps marathon of
several days will be resumed by the
newly athletic employes of tho com
mission. Tim TntnrntntA Commerce Commis
sion has been peculiarly unfortunate
In Its coal and clevatorlng. Tho
very day It decided to probe the
shortage of cars which carry coal
presto, there was no more coal, And It
had to walk upstairs, even to the
ninth floor. ...
Panting and puffing, it bravely kept
on with the work, and the hundreds of
clerks trudged hundreds of weary
steps to get to their tasks. "I be
lieve we are working In Washing
ton's Monument, not the Interstate
building," one of them ejaculated, In
a protest meeting.
There may be some coal some day
soon, but It Is walk up now!

TOMORROW
Republican Nominee Refuses to
Add to His Claims Made on
Stump.
WITH FAMILY AT HOTEL
NEW YORK, Nov. 6. One week ago
today Charles Evans Hughes began
saying publicly: "If I am elected
President, as I expect to be."
That qualifying phrase of confidence
stood today as the Republican candi
date's single Idea of the result tomor
row. He refused to add to It by any fur-
tner rormal claims, but remained
qulotly at the Hotel Astor. visiting
with his family, his only political
activity of the day being a visit to
Republican national headquarters for
a conference with Chairman Wlllcox.
Tho Itopubllcan nominee finishes the
campaign as probably the best-trained
Individual, physically, that ever made
a Presidential race.
Practiced As He Preached.
Ho has preached "America first and
America efficient" everywhere, and at
tho name time done his best to live up
to the idea of efficiency In his own
personal work.
He Is only a trifle under the wolght
he carried when he resigned from the
Supremo Bench. His skin Is clearer,
his muscles harder, his eyes keener,
strenuous but carefully mapped out
life he has led as campaigner In the
most vigorous canvass for votes a
Presidential candidate ovor undertook.
Hughes has lived ns spartan a llfo
as any athlete training for a football
game, and Is Just as coolly confident
coach, of-a college, team would want
! his eleven's captain to be.

Regardless of whether the former
Justice Is elected tomorrow, Mr. and
Mrs. Hughes plan to take a good, long
rest. Tho candidate has been the one
on whom the public thought most of
the labor of campaigning frll-rbut in
reality Mrs. Hughes has had Just as
much of a burden to carry as her hUS
band. It was Mrs. Hughes' self-imposed
duty to seo at all times that the gov

Liable to Fine or $300 or Ninety
Days' Imprisonment, or

Any person In the District of Colum

ities of President Wilson or Candidate
Charles E. Hughes Is a violator of an
offense against public policy and liable

Tho code of law of tho District says
so, and It's supposed to preach tne
goHpel of righteousness to citizens of tho
District.
Tho law prohibiting election bets
reads:
"It shall be unlawful for nny porson
or association of persons to bet. gam

Bureau of Navigation Still Un
certain as to Registry of
the Steamer.
LONDON, Nov. 6. The Ameri
can steamer Lanao has been sunk
by a submarine, a Lloyd's dispatch
stated today. The vessel was
sunk October 28. Thirty members
of the crew were landed at Barry,
Wales, by the Norwegian steamer
Tromp. The Lanao is a steel
screw steamer of 692 tons, whose
port of registry is Manila. She is
owned by the Findlay-Miller
Steamship Company.
The United States Bureau of
Navigation today was uncertain as
to the registry of the Lanao, al
though the Maritime Registry of
November 1 lists her as flying tho
United States flag.
On July 26 the United States
consul general at London reported
the Lanao as on the point of be
ing sold by the Findlay-Miller
company, an English-controlled
concern, to Hans Hannevig, of
Christiania. Whether the sale was
consummated is not known.
AGUILAR SARCASTIC
IN U-BOAT REPLY
uttexican Answer to British Protest
Shows Some Resentment.
MEXICO; CITY, Nov. 6.-Forelgn
Minister Agullar today replied to Great
Britain's note demanding that Mexican
neutrality bo rigorously enforced as re
gards the German submarine believed
to be operating In territorial waters or
the southern republic.
The British note, sent through Secre
tary of State Lansing, and warning
against assistance being afforded tho
Teuton submarine, created strongly un
favorable feeling, which expressed Itself
In Agullar's reply.
The Carranza foreign minister first
pointed out that he failed to see why
the British note should have been
sout through the State Department of
the United tHates Instead of direct to
the Mexican foreign office.
He declared Mexican neutrality
would bo enforced, but pointed out
that Mexico could no more be neia
responsible for German submarine
operations off her coasts than could
tho United States he hold responsible
for tho recent activities of the U-53
off Nantucket, after that undersea
fighter had entered an American port.
Veiled Sarcasm.
The reply, with thinly veiled sarcasm,
suggests that the best way to assure
continued friendly relations between
the two governments Is for the British
fleet to prevent Gcnnan submarines
from leaving their bases, thus eliminat
ing nny chanco for disagreement.
The Carronza foreign office, Agullar
declares, will, however, permit no vio
lation of Its neutrality by any warships
of tho belligerent nations.
Denied U. S. Transmitted Note.
State Department officials today de
nied tho United States Government had
transmitted to Mexico City a note from
the British government warning Mexico
against harboring German submarines.
This was stated In a Mexico City dis
patch giving the text of a noto from
tho Mexican government.
It was learned ptho State Department
had received from tho allied govern
ments Intimations that bases of suppllea
for German submarines Had been estab
lished In tho vicinity of the Mexican
coast. This was transmitted to the Car- .
ranza government as Information, and
was not Intended as nn official docu
ment. THOUSANDS CHEER AT
