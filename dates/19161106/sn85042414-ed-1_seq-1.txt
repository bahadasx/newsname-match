(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D.. Nov. 6.—Bitter pass
ages between the Republican and
Democratic state committee chair
men, coupled with D. H. McArthur's
charge .that the Democratic state
committee attempted to "trade him
off," are striking features at the close
of the North Dakota political cam

Mr. McArthur, Democratic candi

state central committee refused to aid
in his candidacy, but has, as a matter
of fact, attempted to "trade him off"
so that John Burke's candidacy for
the United States senate might be ad

When a Democratic newspaper ad

the committee chairman, Fred "Mc
Lean, openly accused the Republican
committee of fostering the advertise

alienating Nonpartisan support from
Burke.
Chairman Wm. Lemke of the Re
publican committee made a pat re
ply, however, when he asked Chair
man McLean whether Mr. McArthur
or Mr. Frazler was the Democratic
nominee.
"The Democratic state central com
mittee, In its zeal for the national
ticket, has been spending Democratic
funds for the furtherance of the Re

candidacy," said Mr. McArthur, in an

OE DANGERS Of

IN HERWAIfRS
United States Sends Friend
ly Warning to De Facto
Government.
Washington. D. C., Nov. 6.—The
American government has informed
the de facto government of Mexico
that precautions should be taken to
prevent any violation of neutrality by
the operation of belligerent subma
rines within its territorial waters or
the establishment of a submarine base
on the Mexican coast. The informa
tion was conveyed, a state depart
ment official said today, in a friendly
spirit and not at the suggestion of any
of the entente powers.
State department officials realised
that if Germany began a widespread
campaign of commerce raiding as be
lieved possible at the time the sub
marine U-SS attacked allied shipping
off the New England coast it might
be extended to Mexico. The great oil
fields there the principal source of
fuel oil for British war vessels, it
was thought,' might attract German
submarines for the' purpose of de
stroying tank steamers carrying oil
to enemy warships.
It was said today that the Mexican
government is without efficient means
to insure the protection of its neu
trality and that it might be compara
tively easy for a foreign power to es
tablish a submarine base at some un
suspected point along that coast.
Serious complications betweiN?. Mexl-

that any protest had been submitted

WARHAUTY
TO STARVING
AGEDCOUPIE
John Dering and His Help
less Wife Have no Doubt
of it at All.
Bismarck, N. D.. Nov. 6.—If you
believe we are not at war and that
we are not feeling any of the suffer
ings of war, Just turn to half-blind,
rheumatism-crippled and aged John
Derig.
Go to his little home and see his
aged wife, bed ridden and mourning
for her two boys. Listen to the story
the aged father pours into the ears of
Governor Hanna, asking their boys be
restored to them. He tells of the call
of the president to the troops of the
state to come to the aid of the country
when Invaders threaten war, rapine
and devastation on American soil.
He tells how his boys responded to
the call with hearty patriotism despite
the fact that they were the sole sup
port, of their aged parents, and how
the blessing of the helpless mother
and the half-blind and crippled fath
er went jfljb them as they marched
away."""
Alone, helpless, without means of
support, the aged pair withstood the
pangs of hunger and suffering to the
limit of humane resistance and then
they appealed to the county authori
ties for aid to keep from starvation.
They were allowed the munificent sum
of |S per month for food. But winter
is closing in rapidly and there is no
fuel to burn there is no money to
purchase needed medicines—and two
old people are left to survive as best
they can on- $2.60 per month, or 8
cents per day.
The sons, dutiful at home and patrl
otic when the nation needs, are un
able to come to the assistance of their'
suffering parents—and why? They are
needed to prevent the bloodthirsty!
haters of America from invading our!
country. If we have been "kept out of
war," it is these boys and their com
rades who have the credit, and they
and their loved ones are the sufferers.
But old John Dering and his helpless
wife will tell you that we are at war 1
this very minute and that it is the
war in which we are involved that is
keeping their sons away from them—'
no other power on earth could do!
that.
Governor Hanna has given his
promise that he will endeavor to se
cure the release from further service
of the two sons of John Dering.
No doubt there are other cases of a
similar nature not only in North Da
kota but throughout the nation that
is "not at war."

New Tork. Nov. 6.—Wilson and
Hughes, candidates of the dominant
parties for president, remained quiet
ly at their homes today recuperating
from their labors of a long campaign.
The last word sent forward by them
to the people was expressing that
each felt confident of victory. The last

was received at political headquarters
here and

Republican Chairman Wlllcox pre
dicted that Hughes will receive at
least
100

Cormick gives Wilson 264 votes in
that body.
Leaders Confident.
Cohfidence in victory at the polli
was expressed by leaders of both big
political parties throughout the coun
try today, on the eve of the election
which will either keep President Wil
son in office or make Charles E.
Hughes the next president of the Unit
ed States. Notwithstanding that the
republicans made spirited fights in
several southern states the democrats
chiefly are concerned with -prob
lem of getting out the vote*In order to
give Wilson an unusually large plural
ity Tuesday.
Chairmen of the democratic and re
publican committees in Illinois claim
the state will vote for their respective
candidates for president by practical
ly the same plurality, 150,000.
Women Busy in Illinois.
Women will vote for president for
the first time in Illinois. In Wisconsin,
the Hughes-Wilson fight promises to
be close. In Minnesota and North Da
kota both sides claim victory- The re
publicans claim a victory by 20,000
in North Dakota, while Michigan re
publica'ns predict Hughes will carry
that state by 100,000.
In Philadelphia, democratic lead
ers predict that the largest democratic
vote ever registered In the city will be
polled for Wilson, while republicans
anticipate a majority of 150.000 for
Hughes in Philadelphia, and claim he
will carry the state by 200,000. Mis
souri democrats are declaring a sweep
ing victory for their national and state
ticket, while republicans claim the
state for Hughes by 25,000.
Confident claims are made in Massa
chusetts by both sides.
A record-breaking vote is predicted
in Indiana by leaders of both major
parties, who worked vigorously today
to bring out the expected heavy vote.
Republicans Claim New Jersey.
Republicans predicted 45.000 plur
ality in New Jersey. Wilson's home
state, and the democrats predicted
25.000 plurality for their candidates.
Although it is conceded that the
electoral vote of the south will go to
the democrats as usual, this year the
republicans pieked Tennessee, North
Carolina ar.d Florida as favorable bat
tle grounds, having waged hot fights
for state and national tickets there.
Other states have been occupied
mainly wills local issues, and a few
contests for congress.
In South Dakota, both republican
and democratic leaders today claimed
the state for their presidential candi
date. A victory for Wilson by 8.000 Is
claimed by the democrats. Republi
cans insisted against that a "normal"
majority will be rolled up for Hughes.
In Iowa predictions of victory was
forthcoming from both camps today.
Virtually no active campaigning was
done, except that county chairmen of
both parties are instructed to "escort
voters to the polls if necessary."
Utah democrats confidently are
claiming- the state for Wilson.
It is the opinion of the City Board of Health that the- voters should
support the bond Issue to improve the city water filtration plant. The Pub
lic Health Laboratory analysis of the water shows that it is approaching
the danger line. The analysis for the month of October gives 94.6% of
purity instead of the 98% or the 99% that should be obtained. This means
that we are approaching a situation where a typhoid epidemic might occur.
Something must be done. The voters have the option of voting t26,000.00
bonds to run for 20 years at a low rate of Interest, or to bear the improve
ment by direct taxation. The improvement will be made by the Board of
Health as an emergency measure at the direct expense of the city, in ease
the bonds do not carry. But the Board believes in giving the voters the op
tion of deciding whether they want to bear the expense by bonding or by
direct taxation.
