Crimson Clover a Great Soil
Renovator
In renovating a stale soil, re
building a wornout soil, or mak
ing a good soil better there's no
crop better suited to this purpose
than crimson clover. It makes
its growth and is out of the way
for the regular field crops, and
when plowed under, the .average
crimson clover crop furnishes as
much plant food to the acre as 8
tons of good barnyard manure.
From tests made at the Missis
sippi Experiment Station where
the clover was exceptionally
good, the amount of green matter
plowed into each acre was a little
over ten tons. The chemical
analysis showed that this clover
contained approximately 130
pounds of nitrogen, which is
equivalent to the amount of
nitrogen in a ton of cottonseed
meal. The cost of the seed and
planting ranges from $3 to $4
per acre, and the crop will re
turn to the soil when plowed
under $25 to $30 dollars worth of
nitrogen and will furnish enough
grazing during the winter and
early spring to more than pay
for the cost of planting.
In a rotation of silage corn and
crimson clover at this station in
which the crimson clover was
plowed under in the spring, the
yield of corn was ' doubled in
four years. The clover is usually
in full bloom about the first week
in May, when it shonld be plow
ed under, or cut for hay if de
sired, It makes a good quality
of hay, and ;hfle the improve
ment to the soil will be fair if
the crop is plowed under after
the hay is cut the improvement
will be much more rapid if the
whole crop is plowed under.
This is the opening page of a
bulletin on Crimson Clover writ
ten by J. R. Ricks,, agronomist
of the Mississippi A. and M.
College Experiment Station.
The bulletin, which treats on the
preparation of the seed bed,
inoculation of the soil, and other
important phases of raising this
valuable legume, is now on the
press and will be ready for dis
tribution within a few days,
while the supply lasts it will be
sent free to residents of Missis
sippi who will send their names
and addresses to E. R. Lloyd,
Director of Extension, A. and
M. College, Miss.

FOR FLETCHER'S
CASTOR1 A
This Little Woman
Gains 35 Pounds
Another Thin, Frail, Nervous
and Pain-Racked Woman Re
stored to Health.
"Honestly, I am getting so
fat I am really ashamed to tell
you how much I have gained."
said Mrs. Nettie McGarr, who
lives at 1806 Eighteenth Avenue,
North, Nashville, Tenn., several
eays age.
"Actually, it has gotten to be
a regular joke, for I have gotten
so stout that my clothes are too
small for me, and every dress I
wore last winter will have to be
made over again," she continued,
"and the change in my general
appearance is so wonderful that
my friends and neighbors are all
wondering what I have been do
ing with my self, when they ask
me I just tell tell them I have
been taking Tanlac, and it is a
fact, for I have just finished my
third bottle, and have gained 35
pounds.
"When I began taking the
medicine I only weighed 105
pounds now I weigh 140, and
never felt better in my life.
"I always enjoyed very good
health up to about two years ago,
when I began having indigestion,
which gradually developed into a
bad form of stomach trouble.
This trouble began pulling me
down and I finally got so I could
not eat anything at all scarcely,
and had to diet myself contin
ually, I had to avoid sweets of all
kinds and always after 'eating I
would suffer for hours.
"I was also very nervous and
dizzy and was easily tired. I fin
ally got so weak I could not walk
any distance without resting.
My kidneys must have been af
fected also, for I had severe pains
in my sides and back.
"My sister, Mrs. Minnie Hall,
came to see me one day and she
looked so well I asked her what
she had been taking. She told me
Tanlac, and I mc up my mind
right then and there to give it a
trial. '
"Acting on her advice, I
bought a bottle and have been
taking it regulary since. Of
course I expected it to help me,
but if any one had told me that
there was a medicine on earth
that would have helped me like
Tanlac I would not have believed
them. w
"The medicine seemed to be
just the one thing I needed, for
it just filled me with new life
and energy from the very first
dose. In only a few days my ap
petite returned and I began to
enjoy my meals and everything
seemed to agree with me and
nourish me.
"I am no longer nervous, , and
dizzy-headed like I was and can
now sleep like a child. In fact, I
feel just like a person who had
been made all over again. I
hope every suffering woman will
hear about it."
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
W. HOWARD & SON.
Fight Poultry Diseases Before
They Break Out
"An ounce of prevention will
not only save a pound of cure in
keeping the chickens healthy
and thriving at this time of the
year, but will save a great deal
of trouble and expense as well"
This is the opinion of E. P,
Clayton of the Mississippi A.
and M. College, who states that
the time to fight poultry diseases
is before they break out and
offers the following timely
suggestions:
To prevent sorehead and other
kindred diseases that commonly
appear at this season of the year,
feed sulphur and salts to the
poultry as follows: Give a half
teaspoon ful of salts to every
chicken under three pounds in
weight Mix it with the feed.
They will object to such feed at
first but let them get real
hungry and they will eat it
Repeat this dose each week. If
the disease breaks out you will
notice it at first as small wart-
ike knots on the comb and
wattles. As soon as these knots
are noticed, paint the comb and
wattles of the of the affected
chickens with iodine and give a
teaspoonf ul of salts. The follow
ing day paint again. This will
cure all cases if taken in time.
To get rid of mites spray with
pure kerosene oil or a five per
cent solution of Kreso Dip No.
1, and to kill lice dip the chick
ens in a 1J per cent solution of
Kreso Dip No. 1.
To forestall an outbreak of
Cholera or its neighbor, Diar
rhoea, clean up and disinfect
with a five per cent Kreson Dip
No. 1 whitewash. If birds are
not very bad treat with a tea-
spoonful of castor oil with one
drop of carbolic acid in it. Give
this daily for two days. ' If this
gives no relief, the best way
hen to control the disease is to
treat with the hatehet and fire.
Limberneck is caused from
poisoned flesh or some other
poisoned food.' To control it re
move the cause and then clean 1
up and white wash.' Give affect
ed birds a tabtespeonful of castor
oil or salts. Repeat the follow
ing day if not better. If no
better the third day they are
usually too far gone to save.
Paper Makers Are Urged
to Economize by
Trade Board
To Avert National Calamity of
Wholesale Suspension of
Small Publications Co
operation is Asked
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 30. -Ad
ditional cconHcy and more
active co-operation in the manu
facture and consumption of news
print paper are suggested in a
letter addressed to each member
of the News Print Manufactur
ers' Association by the Federal
Trade Commission and made
public today.
Because of the increasing
shortage publishers of the small
er daily and and weekly news
papers throughout the country ,
ear they will have to suspend
publication. The letter says the
suspension of these papers would
be "a national calamity."
The commission suggests that
the association take steps to in
sure publishers not protected by
contracts that they will con
tinue to receive a supply, that
steps be taken to restrain middle
men from charging unreasona
ble and prohibitive prices; that
Sunday operation of paper mills
and the transferring of machines
operating on other grades of
paper to the manufucture of
news print paper, be considered;
and that officials of labor unions
be approached regarding Sunday
work.
The situation the letter says,
is one which calls for patriotic
action by all parties concerned.
