A Community Fair j
By special invitation, Major VV. J. /
Tiller, County Farm Demonstration /A.1
Agent, and Charles L. Ilunlcy, esqCc
F A Secretary of the County Fair Asso-f fa
* ciation, met a large crowd of th<^ be
v citizens of the Catarrh, Angelas and1 no
Macedonia communities Friday after- t)r
noon at a called-meeting at Mace- Ff
donia school house for the purpose P?
of organizing: a Community Fair, lei
The people of this, one of the most Gt
Droirressivo sections of flii
County, have detrmined to co-operate
and put on a Community Fair one an
day next fall. 'ia
Major Tiller and Mr. Hunley made ^U1
intcrsting speeches and outlined the wc
ways by which a Community Fair
can be held. Both these gentlemen an
are very much interested in the Community
Fnir project and both have
had considerable experience along I ,ei
the line of Fnir work, they holding
the positons of vice-president and '
secretary, respectively, in the County
Fair organization. j :in
Much interest was shown by those |
presnt, among them quite a number j s'n
of ladies. The good women folks of ! 1
Macedonia are right in for the move- [ 'la
meat, and their interest alone is suf- att
fieient to insure success. Those who ' 'ea
attended the Catarrh and Angelus o1
f campaign meetings can testify as to nu
what the good ladies in this section , ^ c
can accomplish. Owing to a previous i '
engagement, Miss Stella Mims, the
Home Demonstration Agent, was un- Pn
able to attend the meeting but she ln^
will meet the ladies at Macedonia in 1
the near future. ;nfi
It was the unnnimous sentiment ,e?
of all those present that Macedonia ;u,v
t--- should have a Community Fair this
fall and a permanent organization ^
was effected with the following offleers:
.T. It. Ilorion, president; E. R. ''u
Knight, vice-presicfent; .T. G. Sowell, '^el
secretary-treasurer. These three icp
gentlemen were authorized to name a
J p<t moment committee to n?aiaf I no:
-1 ir? handling the Community Fair. >,v'1
.1 There will be a separate ladies' com- 1
"1 iv. it lee to take care of the woman's illl(
I department of canned goods and ^"r
1 fancy work. A meeting of both these '_,m
| committees will be held within the 01'
<1 next week and complete plans will 1

Vltrhis speech President Wilson was

t- change, and said that old leaders still
1, select its candidates, but he did not
g mention Charles E. Hughes, the Republican
candidate, by name.
1- The president spoke from the ver

i- crowd which filled eight thousand
d chairs and overflowed the lawn,
d Once when he saidv"I neither seek
i- the favor nor fear the displeasure of
d that small alien element among us
which puts loyalty to any foreign

d The notification ceremonies were

Reading slow but distinctly from a
s printed copy of his speech and free
(jnently looking up to emphasize parn
ticular points, Mr. Wilson spoke of
- j the Democratic platform as a "defi1
nite pledge."
y l Reviewing ihe achievemnts of the
- administration he said "alike in the
n \ domestic field and in the wide field of
' the coqpuercc of the world, American
,, l busines and life and industry have
i been set free to move as they never
moved before."
t| He said: "We have provided for

e \ Concluding his list of measures

MOW TO INOCULATE
CLOVER AND VETCH SEED
Clenison College, S. C.?Soil inoculation
in either case is the best inoculation
to be obtained. For crimson
clover, get soil from a tield up- 1
on which crimson clover, red clover,
alsyke clover or little white clover
has grown successfully for several
years. For vetch, use vetch soil, Canada
field pea, sweet pea, or garden
pea soil. Remove the first inch of
the soil, and get your supply from
the next four or five inches. Make
a solution with one part of glue and
15 parts water, or enual parts of
molasses (or sugar) and water. '
Spread the seed upon a sheet, spray enl
them with this solution and roll them ,,n
| on the sheet until each seed is sticky. ]
I Then pour onto the seed a volume of
inoculated soil equal to the volume
of seed, and roll again until each seed ]
is loaded with soil. Sow at once and ate
immediately cover the seed. If the ,,f
sun shines on this inoculation, tin- >|ji
destruction of the bacteria begins at
I once, and they will soon be useless, for
Use a drag harrow or weeder in cov- ,.???
ering the seed. dui
Do not expect any winter legume of
to succeed to perfection with the first at
. sowing. It often takes several crops ufli
I to till the soil with the necessary num- sut
| her of bacteria, especially on poor jui
soil containing little or no humus. n
