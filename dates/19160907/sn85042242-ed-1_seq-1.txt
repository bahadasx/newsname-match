BERLIN ADMITS THE
LOSS OF CLERY
Official Reports Verify Russian
Victories 4,500 Taken
Prisoner.
London, Sept. 6.—While their com­
patriots were busy Wednesday north
of the Somme warding oft German
counter attacks or engaged in artil­
lery duels, the French south of the
river drove their men further into the
German lines for noteworthy gains.
In stubborn fighting over a front of
four miles between Vermandovillers
and Chilly, the Germans have been
forced to give up the northern portion
of Vermandovillers while the French
have occupied the outskirts of the
railway junction town of Chaulnes,
and thrown their forces along the rail­
way running from Chaulnes to Roye,
between Chaulnes and Chilly.
To the north the operations of the
French, with Barleux and ultimately
Peronne as their objective, also met
with success. Southeast of Belloy
en-Santerre, further German trenches
were captured and most of the vil­
lage of Berny-en-Santerre is in French
hands. Paris says the number of
prisoners taken apparently was large.
Loss of Clery Admitted.
Berlin admits the loss of Clery,
which lies a short distance northwest
of Peronne. .........
Russians Record Big Victory.
In Galicia, on the front of the ZU
ta-Lipa-and Dniester rivers, the Rus­
sians have driven the Teutonic allies
from fortified positions and have tak­
en 4,500 prisoners, among them 2,000
Germans. Berlin concedes a victory
to the Russians in this region. Vio­
lent fighting continues around Rrze
zany, southeast of Lemberg, but here
Berlin says the Russians have suffer­
ed heayy losses, and have made no
advance. Russian attacks near Zbo
row, northern Galicia, and in Volhy
nia, also failed, according to Berlin.
Fighting is still going on in the Car­
pathians, where the Russians claim
the capture of additional heights.
In the Roumanian theatre, German
and Bulgarian troops nre still engag­
ed with the Roumanians in the Dob
rudja region. Berlin reports the cap­
ture of seven of the Tutrakan works,
together with their armored batteries.
The Roumanians claim tha: they
have retaken all the Dobrudia fron­
tier east of the Danube, 'between Bul­
garia and Roumania. The towns of
Iplacx and Kalafat, on the Danube,
have been bombarded by the Teu­
tons.
Russians in Turkish Armenia con­
tinue their progress against the Turks
near Ognott, inflicting heavy casual­
ties on them, according to Petrograd.
On the Macedonian front, only bom­
bardments are in progress.
Italian Advance.
In Albania the Italian advance has
been stopped, says Berlin, and the
Teutonic allies have recaptured all
positions taken from them recently,
east of Avlona.
HOPE TO RATIFY
PURCHASE TREATY
Thought Danish West Indies
Proposition May Be Cleared
Up Soon.
Washington, Sept. 6.—Administra­
tion senators tonight had hope of rati­
fying at this session of congress the
treaty to purchase the Danish West
Indies for $25,000,000. After several
hours' discussion in executive session,
there were clear indications that more
than two-thirds of the senate favor
the purchase.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for­
eign relations committee, asked for a
vote tonight, but yielded when in­
formed that Senator Borah and Cum­
mins, who were present, desired to
discuss the treaty before any vote
was taken. A few senators, including
Senators Norris, Nelson and Thomas,
said they thought the price to be paid
was too high. Senator Nelson how­
ever, said he thought Hie price ought
not to prevent the purchase.

Penitentiary
Jefferson City, Mo., Sept. 6.—What
prison officials declared to be a sec­
ond attempt within twenty-four hours
to fire the Missouri state penitentiary,
was discovered tonight in a clothing
shop, the largest prison factory. Elec­
tric wires were discovered with cloth­
ing so arranged, it was said, tljat the
clothing would ignite on turning on
the current.
Yesterday the broom factory, anoth­
er prison plant, was fired and losses
sustained, amounting to $14,000.
DEI SYSTEI OF
SAVES {10,
MO
D. J. McGillis Has Made Fine
Record as State Transporta­
tion Officer.
SHERIFFS OF STATE IN
SYMPATHY WITH LAW
The last legislative assembly made
it the duty of the reform school, the
penitentiary, and the hospital for the
insane, to send for those committed
to such institutions instead of having
them brought there by the sheriffs.
This would necessitate each of these
institutions having an extra man at
all times to perform this work. The
board of control requested the warden
o( the state penitentiary, the superin­
tendent o,i' tfc-i '.f .rm school, afid the
superintendent c! ii'e hospital for the
insane, to appoint Mr. McGillis as
their transportation agent, which was
done, and how well he has performed
this service will be shown by the fol­
lowing facts:
For the past year, under this agree­
ment, there has been committed 1o
the hospital for the insane, 223 pa­
tients to the penitentiary at Bis­
marck, 243 inmates, and to the re­
form school at Mandan, 47, making a
total of 513, at an average cost of
$21.55 for each person, which includes
the transportation agents salary and
all expenses connected therewith. In­
cluded in the insane patients handled,
one was sent from the hospital for the
insane at JameBtown, N. D., to each
of the following states, as they were
not residents of this state: Chicago,
111. Chilton, Wis. Toledo, O. Minne­
apolis, Minn. Waverly, la., and North
Carolina.
Cost $44.77 Before.
It has been found that this branch
of service cost the state prior to this
change in the law, $44.77 for each in­
mate sent to the various institutions.
It will be seen by this that the state,
under the new law, has made a saving
of $11,516.85 in one year.
Under the old law, sheriffs did this
work on a per diem, mileage, and ex­
penses, and were allowed guards who
were allowed similar compensation.
As a rule sheriffs availed themselves
of the services of guards. Mr. McGil­
lis, generally, has no assistant unless
he has four or five prisoners, and has
been known to have handled five and
six inmates without any assistance.
"We can not speak to highly for the
intelligent and efficient manner in
which he has discharged the duties of
his office and kept down his expense
account," declares the board of con­
trol.
More than $10,000 has been saved
in one year through the transporta­
tion of prisoners and other state
wards by a state agent. These figures
were compiled from state records yes­
terday. D. J. McGillis, state transpor­
tation agent, has made an excellent
record in the handling of the state
wards under the new system. Not one

PRACTICE BILL
Heated Argument Takes Place in
Senate When Measure Is
Discussed.
PERSONAL ENCOUNTER
NARROWLY AVOIDED
Senators Ashurst and Curtis
Clash When Violation of Law
Is Charged.
Washington, Sept. 6.—'While the
senate was waiting today on the rev­
enue bill conferees, the Owen corrupt
practices bill was taken up and made
the vehicle for several hours of acri­
monious debate. Republican and
Democratic senators indulged in per­
sonal exchanges and regaled their fel­
low senators with accounts of cam­
paign contributions and the rewards
given to some contributors in the
past.
The vote to take up the bill was
32 to 14, nine Republicans voting
with the majority to consider the
measure and seven Democrats voting
against it. Senator Owen, its author/
tonight canceled a speaking engage­
ment before the Ohio Democratic con­
vention to remain here and fight for
its adoption. It probably will be
taken up again ibefore noon tomor­
row and the Oklahoma senator in­
tends to keep it before the senate
until a vote is secured or, what is
more probably, adjournment is forced
by the leaders.
Personal Encounter Avoided.
Senator Curtis of Kansas, Repub­
lican, and Ashurst of Arizona, Demo­
crat, furnished the excitement, of the
day's debate in an interchange which
looked for a few minutes as if it
might result in a personal encoun
ter.
The bill would restrict campaign ex­
penditures of candidates for the sen
ate, the house, and for the presidency
and vice presidency, to a greater ex
tent than existing law. Senator Cur
tis argued that such a measure pass­
ed when a campaign is half over
might work unfairly against men who
already have spent the stipulated
amount. He advocated a more strin­
gent law than that proposed, and one
that would particularly restrict the
use of the congressional rank to pre­
vent senators or representatives from
sending out campaign appeals at gov
ernment expense. He read a letter
from Senator Ashurst to a constituent
reciting his record as a basis for sup
port, and said he understood that 70,
000 of these had been franked out, in
violation of the privilege.
Heated Argument Ensues.
"If the senator charges that this
is a violation of the law," said Sena­
tor Ashurst, when he got the floor,
"he has sweetbreads for brains."
Calling Senator Curtis the "Pharisee
from Kansas," and brushing aside
several chairs, he strode across the
center aisle and shook his finger un­
der Curtis' nose. Senator Smoot,
seated just between the two, moved
back in alarm, as Senator Ashurst
approached. Senator Curtis smile',
but kept his seat.
A little later, iMr. Ashurst turned
on Senator Penrose, who said he had
noticed a "copper lobby" around the
capitol, whose members had been
talking with the Arizona senator.
"If," said Mr. Ashurst, "the senator
means to say that my vote has been
influenced by a copper lobby or by
any other lobby he lies." Several
senators objected to this language,
and Senator Ashurst, after he had
said "If," agreed to withdraw his re­
marks.
Democrats Favor Bill.
Senator ,Curtis said it was well
known the Democrats were in favor
of the bill, as Secretary McAdoo and
other cabinet members already had

Revenue Loss.
TAX ON CORPORATION
STOCK IS APPROVED
Committee Works Through Most
of Night to Get Measure
In Shape.
Washington, Sept. i.—-Elimination
of all stamp taxes in the emergency
revenue bill, seriously objected to by
the house, was agreed upon late to­
night by the conference committee,
house conferees yielding in exchange
for this concession the demand for
restoration of a tax on refiners of cop­
per.
To make up for the loss of about
$5,000,000 revenue, in sacrificing the
stamp taxes, the conferees are expect­
ed to agree to a suggestion of house
members that the net profit tax of
manufacturers of munitions of war be
increased from ten to twelve and one
half percent.
Sacrifice of the proposed stamp tax­
es gets the revenue bill back in ac­
cord with the original determination
of the administration leaders, and the
house ways and means committee to
repeal all of those provisions in the
existing war revenue law, which were
generally regarded as annoyances by
the public. The proposed stamp fax­
es now eliminated, include bonds,(de­
bentures and certificates-, of stock,
agreement to sale,1 Ware­
houses and custom hbtfi&r, receipts,
foreign steamship tickets and Pullman
car tickets.
At midnight the conference was re­
ported to be in practical agreement on
all vital provisions of the bill, al­
though it was declared that working
out of details of reports could not be
concluded until sometime tomorrow.
The committee prepared to work
through most of the night.
The proposed license tax on corpor­
ation stock, increases in the duty on
dyestuffs, increases in the income and
inheritance taxes and the provisions
creating a tariff commission, all were
approved.
A continuing appropriation of $300,
000 a year for the tariff commission,
however, was said to have been strick­
en out. The conference also was re­
ported to have under consideration
changes in the proposed taxes on
wine.

Minneapolis, Sept. 6.—The motion
for a new trial made by counsel for
Joseph W. Bragdon, wealthy Minne­
apolis business man, convicted of an
offense against a 14-year-old girl, will
be heard before Judge Fish in the
district court here Monday.
Affidavits supporting the motion for
a new trial have been served on Wal­
ter M. Newton, assistant county at­
torney, by C. B. Elliott and James Rob­
ertson, attorneys for Bragdon.
In the alndavits, errors are alleged
on the admission of testimony relat­
ing to charges against Bragdon other
than the one which he was convicted.
A second affidavit, signed by Mr.
Robertson, accuses the attorneys for
the state with attempting to influence
the articles concerning the trial ap­
pearing in three daily Minneapolis
newspapers and one in St. Paul.

OUT OF SECRET CAUCUS
Members Deny They Attempted
to Freeze Out Any Democrat
on State Ticket.
Stormy sessions marked yesterday's
meeting of the Democratic State Cen­
tral committee. From the moment
that Fred McLean of Fargo, opponent
of D. H. iMcArthur, candidate for gov­
ernor, was elected chairman, all at­
tempts to inject harmony into the
proceedings failed, abjectly.
The gubernatorial nominee asserts
that he was ignored entirely in the
selection of the chairman, while the
leaders of the opposing faction in­
sist that he and his supporters were
invited to a conference yesterday
morning, at which three names were
presented and iMr. McLean received
the majority of the votes cast. Mr.
McArtliur emphatically declares that
he Rnew nothing about any caucus,
until after the committee had electcd
tue Fargo man.
Other Candidates.
J. Nelson Kelly of Grand Forks
and E. H. Stenvick of Minot were the
two other names brought before the
conference. Mr. McLean is said to
have received l." of the 24 votes cast.
The candidate for governor was not
in the room when the committee vot­
ed for chairman, not arriving until
after a recess had been taken to al­
low the resolutions committee to pre­
pare its report.
Defies Members.
He paced up and down the aisle
back of the seats in the senate cham­
ber, delivering a vitriolic tirade at
one of the members and then another,
until he had read practically all of
them out of the party. In strong lan­
guage, he told them that they could
go wherever they wished, that he
was through with the whole pack of
"traitors," that he would go before
the Democracy of North Dakota and
ask a repudiation at the polls of the
men who put over the "most con­
temptible, underhanded, cheap politi
cal trick ever perpetrated in the
state.
iHis friends tried to console him.
They urged him to be less emphatic
in his statements. But the pleas for
party harmony were not -listened to.
After he had completed his wholesale
attack on the committeemen, he left
the hall and refused to have any­
thing to do with them. The.r invita­
tion to appear before the platform
committee with suggestions was
spurned.
Platform of His Own.
While 'Mr. 'McArthur did not last
night repudiate the platform adopted
at the evening meeting, he intimated
that he would do so and soon an
nounce one of his own, on which he
would make a single-handed fight
Some of the gubernatorial ca.idi
dates charge the action of the com­
mittee to their willingness to sacrifice
everything for the election of John
Burke as United States senator. It
was hoped by subordinating the gub­
ernatorial fight to secure support fr.im
Non-partisan league members for
Burke.
The McArthur men, on the other
hand, believed that their only hope
of success was through an appeal to
the conservative element of the vot­
ers and had planned a program that
steered shy of state-owned enterprises
and other radical moves that are op­
posed by many.
Platform is Libertal.
But the platform brought in by the
committee, composed of George T.
Murray, J. Nelson Kelly, Oscar Green­
land, Charles Simon, E. J. Hughes,
Judge Nuchols and S. J. Doyle, was
more extreme than the one adopted
early in the day by the Republicans.
In no instance was there bait for the
conservative vote.
But despite a heated discussion,
with Judge Nuchols leading the con­
servatives and Mr. Murray the radi­
cals. it was passed with only one dis­
senting vote.

WILL IGNORE HEAD
OF PARTY COMMITTEE
D. H. McArthur, Democratic candi­
date for governor, will ignore the state
organization and conduct his own
campaign regardless of Fred McLean,
selected yesterday to direct the desti­
nies of the party for the next two
years.
Most of McArthur friends see in
the action to sidetrack him, the hand
ot' John Burke. It is said that the con­
spiracy is to sacrifice McArthur in
hopes of winning support from mem­
bers of the Non-partisan league for
the candidacy of John Burke.
Mr. McArthur was ignored by the
organization that captured the state
central committee yesterday. They
blocked a movement to have him ad­
dress the committee. No time was
lost in informing Mr. McArthur that
he was to have no voice in the cam­
paign arrangements. Burke Demo­
crats made it plain that all effort
would be concentrated upon the Unit­
ed States senatorial fight.
The Democratic candidate for gov­
ernor last evening issued a statement
denouncing the tactics of the McLean
faction. It follows:
Place Hunters.
"The action today of the Demo­
cratic state central committee, domi­
nated by a small coterie of place-hunt

tender for the league, was obossn sec*
jfeteiy.
Spi'agtie Made Temporary Chairman.
Frank Sprague, the outgoing com*
inittee chairman, was made temporary
chairman. On motion of Mr. McKaig,
a rising vote of thanks was tendered
him for the fair and efficient manner
in which he conducted the meeting.
Considerable time was lost debating
over the temporary organization. Af­
ter a tempest in a tea-pot had waged
for more than an hour, F-ranlt Sprague
was selected as temporary chairman
and A. E. Leslie of Sargent county,
temporary secretary.
The name of K. J. Nomland of Traill
county was proposed for temporary
chairman and a roll call demanded.
Mr. Sprague received 23 votes and
Nomland 20. Following this action
the organization was made perma
nent for the purposes of that meet*
ing.
It was announced at this time that
Mr. Sprague was not a candidate for
becretary of the state central commit­
tee. Many were in favor of his con­
tinuing in office, but he explained that
for business reasons he could not ac­
cept.
The first action after the election ot
permanent officers was the appoint­
ment by the chairman of the follow*
ing to the resolutions committe: L. A.
Simpson, Treadwell Twitcbell, V. A,
Corbett, Berndt Anderson, R. J.
Hughes, G. S. Reishus and H. W,
Green.
Amendments Moved.
The unanimous report of the com*
mittee left out several of the planks
urged by the Non-partisan elague and
Mr. McKaig moved amendments, all
but one of which were adopted, but by
a close vote.
A clause was inserted by the com­
mittee in the plank declaring for a
terminal elevator, which provided that
it should be erected within the state.
The member from Morton county mov­
ed that these qualifying words be
struck out. Treadwell Twitcbell and
L. A. Simpson opposed this, asserting
that the terminal elevator should be
built where it could be controlled by
the state and that this control was
only possible when it is built in North
Dakota. He said that the people did
not want a repetition of the light two
years ago, when lobbyists from anoth­
er state swarmed into the capitol. Mr.
McKaig held that the legislature
should be left free to do as it* thought
best.
The amendment carried by an
affirmative vote of 25, with 44 present.
No Votes Against Normal.
E. L. Richter of Larlmore, Grand
Forks county, here put an amendment
striking all reference in the platform
to the location of a normal acbool
on the Missouri Slope.
This brought forth a spirited reply
from L. A. Simpson of Dickinson,
Stark county. He declared that he
ba i.i oppo^d the giving of mon­
ey in educational Institutions
whi. o, Forks had monopolised
and I'ul diti not see why the mem*
ber of that county should object to the
support of a normal school In ft dis­
trict which was not now represented
