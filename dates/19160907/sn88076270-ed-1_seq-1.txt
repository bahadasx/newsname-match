"I am a comparitive stranger in
this state and this is the firfet fair of
any sort I have attended here, but
I will admit without any parley that
there is evidence enough here to con
vince any reasonable man that this
county has a remarkably productive
soil. I am told that the rain was
scarcely normal this season and that
you have done no irrigating, but the
moisture has certainly been sufficient.
What surprises me most is the great
variety of products grown, and the
uniform quality of so many samples.
I had believed that wheat and grass
were about all you grew."
The above are two out of many
similar comments heard in the agri
cultural building as out,of town visi
tor mingled with local people and dis
cussed the splendid display of field
and garden products.
The best fair we have had, was the
universal verdict. From live stock to
pansys, from auto races to farmer's
race, every feature set new standards.
The weather was made to order
and while the attendance was good it
was not as large as was hoped for.
Harvest was not yet finished and
felt they could not
the grand stand was taxed showing
that larger accommodations are
needed.
Farm Club Displays
The quantity, quality and attrac
tive arrangement of the vast variety
of farm and home products were be
yond just description—they had to be
seen to be appreciated. Grain, veg
etables, grasses, dairy products, pre
served fruits, cookery, needle work,
art work—all vastii'uuy and novelly
arranged—me the eye in every booth.
Club Awards
"I am glad I do not have to judge
between these displays" was a re

had. The awards were made as fol

gave so much time to assisting oth

own work.
Single exhibits and assortments
from individual farms and gardens
closely filled the remaining space in
the building and were a sip'ht worth
seeing. The wide variety shown was
cause of great surprise to visitor,
who were strangers in the county. I
The floraculture displays were ex
tra fine. The beautiful assortments
of sweet peas and pansys from the
gardens of Eclwin Rickert and W. B.
Overson caused much comment.
The educational exhibits wer^ un
doubtedly the largest ever made at
the fair. Space for this department
was far short of the needs.
Race Programs
The entries of the harness events
included some the best horses in the
Northwest and. the track record was
broken when Alsafras paced a mile
in 2:13 flat in the free for all. Some
of the owners refused to have their
steppers "marked"' so accurate time
was not announced in all races.
The auto races held greater interest
than ever for the crowd and each
event was a real fight for speed su
premacy although very high w'i

per cent of sunshine.
Wiiiiston Graphic
London, Sept. 2.—Victorious on
seven battle fronts at once, the arm
ies of the Entente Allies are begin
ning to tighten the jaws of their
steel vice clamped about the Central
Powers.
With the summer campaigns far
advanced, the Teutonic forces have
lost the offensive on every line. Turk
ish and Austro-Hungarian troops are
in full retreat the Moslem offensive
directed,against the Suez canal not
only has been checked, latest reports
indicate, but has been flung back on
its base, Katia, 30 miles from its ob
jective along the Balkan front, the
Bulgarian invasion of Macedonia has
come to a standstill simultaneously
with the launching of a fresh allied
offensive by Italian troops in Albania.
The Berlin war office, while assert
ing that its lines on the eastern front
are holding, admits the resumption
of the Russian drive towai'd Lemberg
and Haliez, and the piercing of the
Teuton defences by attacks of "great
ly superior numbers."
In the Trentino region, the Italians,
already within a few miles of the last
Austrian lines defending Trieste,
strengthening their grip on newly
won ground are beginning to resume
their thrust to cleave "Italian Irre
denta" from Austria.
On the western battlelines also the
Germanic armies have lapsed into de
fensive fighting, following failure of
their attempt to resume the offensive
before Verdun and the crumpling
back of their counterdrives along the
Somrne.
The increased pressure on every
front is having its effect in Germany.
The chief nation of the central al
liance is preparing to retire upon its
inner defenses, both in the field and
in its war councils.
It is now known that General von
Hindenburg is not only in supreme
command of all the German forces,
but that his genius also will direct
the armies of Austria, Bulgaria, and
Turkey, in closest co-operation with
the allied Teutonic general staffs.
Von Hindenburg in the future will
be the guiding brain of battles, from
Lille to Bagdad. The vastness of his
new power is further exemplified by
the fact that with his nomination as
chief of staff he enters the small, ex
clusive circle of men who may be
called the highest leadership of the
German empire.
Rumanian troops won a decisive
victory over the Austrians in the first
pitched battle since Rumania enter
ed the war.
An official statement from the Aus
trian war office tonight admits an
Austrian defeat near Orsova, the
"iron gate'' of Hungary, after five
days of fierce fighting. The Austrians
withdrew to the west bank of Cerna
river, the statement said, the Ru
manians following slowly.

Louisville, Ky., Sept. 5.—Charles
E. Hughes, when he passed through
Louisville today on his way to Lex
ington to speak, was an entirely dif
ferent man than the candidate who
started out to tour the country four
weeks ago.
Probably no other speaker, let alone
a presidential nominee, ever under
went such an experience as Hughes
did at the Ryman auditorium, Tenn.,
last night. He faced an audience
"packed" against him and distinctly
unfavorable to his views. The crowd
ftissed and hooted Hughes and cheer
ed loudly for Wilson, but the repub
lican nominee, undaunted, simply
struck straight out from the shoulder
tend rammed home his bitter criticism
pf the democratic administration with
pew lines of hot shot.
Courage Wins Cheers
And his nerve won him cheers in
place of the jeers.
He ridiculed the strike settlement
recently achieved by President Wilson
and had the satisfaction of hearing
cheers and applause from the south
erners for his fighting spirit and his
determination to fight it out.
"We have, in the past, had to deal
frequently with the opposition of em
ployers to the principle of arbitra
tion," Mr. Hughes said.
"Sometimes they have refused to
arbitrate disputes. Public opinion
has been against them.
"I stand here firmly for the prin
ciple of arbitrating industrial dis
putes, and I would not surrender it
to anybody in the country.
"I believe that anything that is
right in this country can he settled
•right. What is our republican gov
ernment? What are oui" free insti
tutions? We have come down the
long course of history with the peo
ple fighting slowly, slowly—now with
defeat and now with victory—for a
recognition of the reign of reason in
stead of the reign of tyranny and
force.
"Now then I stand for two things:
"First, for the principle of fair, im
partial, thorough, candid arbitration
and, second, for legislation on facts
w-.'ording to the necessities of the
case.
Dictation Denounced
"And I am opposed to being dic
tated to either in the executive de
partment or congress by any power
on earth before the facts are known.
"We have a great country and a
great future. But it can only be pre
served in one way. That way is the
way of all honest, fair investigation
and candid treatment. Show me the
way that is right and I will take it
but I won't take any way that I do
not know anything about."
The nominee then assailed the ad
ministration for its policy toward
Mexico.
"What would you have done?"
shouted a man in the audience.
"I would have protected American
rights,'' the nominee shouted quick
ly, pointing his finger at the ques
tioner. The audience rose to its feet
and applauded loudly. It was the

also was adopted. The amendment
is directed against Canadian fisheries
on the Pacific and encourages devel
opment of American fisheries there.
The drastic amendments to the
revenue bill, striking at the allied
blacklist and British interferences
with American mails, created con
sternation among the diplomatic rep
resentatives of the Allies.
In allied quarters it was declared
that the enactment of the amend
ments into law would constitute noth
ing less a nonintercourse act, pre
liminary to a commercial warfare
with possibilities of far reaching con
sequences.
Protests Are Promised
Until the retaliatory amendments
become law with the president's sig
nature, th^ Allies technically have
nothing to protest about, but there
are assurances that representations
will be made if the amendments stay
in the bill.
Inasmuch as the government had
decided on a course of legislation to
meet the restraints on commerce
which deplomatic action has been un
able to remove, it is generally expect
ed that the amendments will go thru.
