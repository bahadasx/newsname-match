yesterday underwent a minor opera

turned home last night Fire
which destroyed the residence of

Tuesday night, also destroyed Ek
right's wealth, which he has been
accumulating for the last ten years.
All of Mr. Ekright' s money had been
hidden in the tamily clock. Mr.
Ekright himself did not know the
exact amount of his savings, but
said it was about $500. He is an au
tomobile mechanic. Mr. and Mrs.
Ekright and their two' children early

o'clock, neighbors discovered the
fire. At that time the interior of

the fire department. He started to
enter the house to obtain the money
but was prevented by members of
tho department. The house was a
small cottage which the Ekrights
have been occupying for some time.
It caught fire some weeks ago, from
a defective flue at that time. No
cause of the fire Tuesday night could
be found.
Sioux City Journal, 3rd: Miss
Leo Lange, of Homer, Neb., is the
guest over Sunday of Mrs. Phillip
Gregory, 38&1 Orleans avenue, en
route to Ute, where she will teach
in the public schools.. .."IloveSteve
and we are not going to part," said
Daisy Stockwell, 15-year-old daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. H. Stockwell, of
Leeds, at police headquarters. The
girl eloped to Dakota City yesterday
afternoon with Stephen Sturgis. 22
years old, af Leeds, and their mar
riage was performed by Rev. Francis
J. Aucock, a Methodist minister.
Late last evening the couple return
ed to Sioux City and went to their
home in Leeds. The Sturgis and
Stockwell families live in the same
house. Tho announcement of their
marriage caused a break in the
Stockwell family. The parents
swore that the girl was but 15 years
old and that the marriage should be
annulled. Mrs. Anna Roberts, police
matron, was called into the case.
The young married couple were ta
ken to tho matron's quarters at po
lice headquarters. Mrs. Roberts
found that Daisy's( age had been
given in Dakota City as 18 years.
However, she felt that tho matter
should bo left to the parents. When
Mr. and Mrs. Stockwell arrived at
the matron's department they found
tho couple in one of the matron's
largest rockers. They were content
ed. Pleadings of Mr. and Mrs.
htocKweu to tneir daughter were
unheeded. After spending an hour
in an attempt to persuade Daisy to
return homo, the parents abandoned
their objections and Daisy and Steve
departed with hands clasped.
it does not minister to them spiritu
al tilings it is of no use to them or
the community. People ought to
gej the strong idea that they get
from the church just what they let
the church bring thousand as much.
The church is often spoken against
for not doing some things, but it is
not the church's business to dispense
all sorts of things. She deals in
spiritual things, the christian reli
gion, and all other things are for
eign to her. And because so many
do not discern spiritual things they
think the church has nothing for
them. But there is no limit to what
she will do for a man if the man will
let the church minister to him.
The question is, "What is your
atuiii , what are you doing?" Are
you Mowing any desire for the
church to be a benefit to you? You
must be anxious enough for her to
serve you that you will at least be
passive and permit yourself to be
acted upon. How many a man it
picked up and simply carried by the
church, made better simply by con
tact with the people of the church.
But that is not a man's part. A
man's part is to do your stunt and
never grunt, be a man and lift.
It is not for the pastor to ask what
you are doing, but for every one
to ask of himself what he is doing.
You can answer that for yourself.
Look yourself in the face and ask it
aloud. Am I helping as I ought,
and am I getting' the pleasure out of
the helping that I am entitled to?
There is a good deal of work to be
done in the good cause, but if I am
doing my share it will not be hard
for any one. I know no one wants
me to do more than my part, and all
are anxious that I do that. We
heard a person say the other day
have no vital lorce in her, lor it is
not worthy of her consideration,
she cannot trust it to anything.
Wo know nothing goes without
effort. Your family does not go
without it, and you expect to do tho
labor and pay the bills. Do you
think tho church will go any other
way than your home? What are
you doing? Would your home be a
home if you never went there even
tho you paid the bills? Separate
maintainance or alimony does not
make a home, and to contribute to
the support of the church is not
taking your part in tho saving in
stitution. What are you doing, and
do you expect the church to grow
upon what you are doing for it?
When everybody helps the work is
easy and delightful.
The Immanuel's missionary society
will meet at the parsonage next
Thursday afternoon. You will be
welcome. 2:30 p. m.
Immanuel's Ladies Aid will meet
at the parsonage Wednesday, Sep
tember 13, at 8 o'clock. Come and
enjoy a pleasant social time. Re
member you can lead the horse to
water but you cannot make him
drink. The church can provide
these times for the congregation
but cannot make them come. It is
up to you, what are you going to
do?
The pastor visited thb Lutheran
congregation at Homer last Sunday
afternoon, preached for them and
administered the communion. This
was a pleasure.
Remember Rally Day for our
Sunday schools next Sunday. Better
come to Sunday school and stay to
church.
