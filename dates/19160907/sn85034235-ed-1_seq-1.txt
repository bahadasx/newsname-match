T | Abner approached him.

hungry tisli. If this thing goes through
it will lie the talk of the county. Say.

you'd better keep your eye peeled

vertiser in seven states aud will do you
if lie can® And, with an exultant
smile, the merchant turned into his
store.
Abner finished reading the communi
cation just received at the foot of the
stairs and then went up to the office
Throwing his armful of papers on a
table, he glanced across the .room at
Howard, who was at work on an ed
itorial.
"Say," he began, smiling significant
ly, "you was snyin' you was a feared
tiiat we'd run a little shy on news for
tomorrow's issue, wasn't you?"
"I thought so," Howard returned,
"but I guess we can manage to fill up
by running some reserve matter al
ready in type."
"We won't have to," Abner smiled,
as lie tapped on the table with the
folded sheets he had received.
"Why? Has something happened?"
Howard asked, curiously.
"You'll think so," Abner chuckled.
"We've got a new correspondent over
the mountains at Elktown—Thomas L.
Keith he signs hisse'f, and he's a corker,
ef I am any judge. D.rop that work
an' listen to this."
Howard turned in his seat, and.
opening the manuscript and .clearing
his throat, Abner began to read in a
sort of declamatory tone which he
used when he wished to be impressive:
Elktown, Ga., Wednesday Morning
Editor the New Clarion:
Dear Sir—I am writing to you with the
hope that I may be enrolled as your cor
respondent from this charming mountain
hamlet. I have never tried my hand at
newspaper work, but I have always felt
that I would like it as a pastime, and
after reading about what a princely host
you were at your recent dinner to the
rural correspondents of the New Clarion
and what*a gay time you all had in such
a brotherly and sisterly way, I admit Î
have had the pen fever worse than ever
And as for a suitable outlet for my ef
forts, I must say, without any Intention
to flatter, that I know of no journal that
I would rather be a contributor to than
yours. That such a well printed, well ed
ited paper could emanate from a small
town in north Georgia In these days of
struggle is a marvel that I find difficulty
to adjust myself to.
"Fine, ain't it?" Abner paused to
comment and spit. "He knows what's
what, ef T'm a proper judge, an' I'm
glad secli a feller appreciates what we
are doin'. But jest wait—that's jest
the introduction to the main stuff
That's cornin', as you'll see in a min
ute."

I am happy to say, Mr. Editor (Abner
resumed reading) that it happens now
that I am able to transmit some impor
tant news—news, it seems to me at this
distance, to be of unusual interest to poo
pie of all ages, sizes, classes and sexes
Something of an astonishing nature lias
just come to light here In these quiet old
mountains and the excitement Is absolute
ly unprecedented and is spreading like a
swollen torrent of water.
It started from an old report that has
been whispered and talked and hinted at
ever since the last Cherokee Indian trib
lived here and was finally run off by ou
early settlers to the west. As you and
your esteemed readers are doubtless
aware, it Is a fact of history and present
day observation that those same Indian
dug gold with considerable success all
around Elktown, as is proved by the
old pits and shafts which still greet the
eye In mrny spots. Now that fact Is not
only established beyond a peradventure
by what has just come to light; but,
moreover, the old story about a certain
Indian chieftain burying a big treasure
of nugget gold appears to have had actual
foundation, as you will see by what fol
lows.
The old tales had died out; folks were
going about their various affairs In theii
daily walks, never dreaming cf the bomb
of untold wealth that was to explode in
our sylvan midst, when a. stranger arriv
ed from the Indian territory and put up
at the Elktown hotel. He had no partic
ular business that anybody could see, bu
kept coming and going and saying noth
Ing to anybody. Some thought he was
an agent sent out to buy up lumber
lands for some rich company or inspect
water power plants.
But as the man continued to stay and
act secretive in the extreme, the specula
tion as to what he was up to became rife
For one thing the stranger had an odd
look. He was as dark as a mulatto, had
very high, if not actually protrudin
cheek bones. was remarkably tall,
straight as a ramrod and had hair
thick and stiff as No. 8 spool thread
Many noticed that he looked happy. In
fact, folks on the watch caught him gri
ning to himself when he thought nobody
was looking. He paid his bill; in fact
made lavish tips all about. He had pack
cd up his belongings and was waiting for
tiie train to take him off when he sud
dcnly fell sick.
The amiable proprietor of the Elktow
hotel and his kind hearted and popular
wife tried to attend to his needs as wcl
as they could, and it appears that they
overheard him saying things net intended
Cor other ears than his pwn. He seemed
to be afraid that the hand of the
reaper was 'overshadowing him and w
anxious to get something of vast ini
portance off his mind and at the samt
time to be aware that none but his ow
chosen people could be received into his
confidence. He kept saying: "Gold, gold,
gold! Chunks and chunks of It! Under
the mossy rock; keep to the right! Go
down hill to stream, then left up the slope
and down again to gum spring!" The
man died at break of day.
There was nothing to do but lay him
away in as decent a form as was possible
Nobody could guess whafTeligion. if any.
he had and so no particular denomination
officiated, though all las represented
at an impressive ceremony at the tomb
Nobody knowed (the prohounciation was
Abner's, interpolated injhis excitement)
where the deceased llv^d, and so Ills
friends and relatives cot|ld not be noti
fied, but they were evidently on the watch
as to his movements. Whether It was
something he had written bartc to his
folks or his failure to write can only be
surmised. It was a fafct, though, that
within ten days after the Interment two
well dressed, dark skinned men with the
same high cheekbones and other -facial
blemishes and straight ipeks came and
put up at the hotel. ®
They could not hide th<yexcitement they
were in. They spent the days nosing about
in the mountains and thç nights confab
bing together In their room. Sometimes
they would get the proprietor of the hotel
to tell them exactly what the dead man
had mumbled in his delirium.
As you and your gentle readers may
well imagine, the whole matter got in a
ferment in the neighborhood. Nothing
else was talked of at the fireside, in the
field, office or place of business
The Indian fellows that had come seem
ed to give up, or pretended to give up, for
they went their way as silently and mys
teriously as they had arrived But what
happened after they left?
With all the lynx eyed ability of their
forefathers they had overlooked a thing
that a little boy, the twelve-year-old son
of one of our most highly esteemed farm
s, discovered by bare accident when he
had his pa's shotgun out hunting yester
He ran across a big, flat sided
bowlder of gray limestone a mile or so
from town facing due east. On it were
some letters that bad evidently been made

and, while washed with thç plenteous rains

I beg leave to sign myself, respectfully
and admiringly yours.
THOMAS L. KEITH.
"Ain't that a stunner?" Abner asked,
is he finished rending. "1 don't know
what Iveith he is. hut he must be some
kin o' old Uncle Tommy Keith over
tliar. The Keiths in that section are as
thick as flies in August" "
"Now, we must git to work an' set
this up in type. Put the biggest head
lines on it you possibly kin get up, and.
above all, mum's the word. The news
may reach Darley overland before our
paper is out. hut we'll hope not It
would tickle me the best in the world
to see the folks openin' the New Clar
ion tomorrow an' mimin' across an
item like that just as ef seeli news was
in everyday matter with us."
Howard was about to reply when he
was arrested by a step on the stairs,
and Frank Reymond entered. "1 have
political item for you," he said. "I
have just heard it from a reliable
source. Henry W. Poitou has come
out in the governor's race and will
make a strong candidate. It will be
imi>ortant news for southern dailies. I
have just wired it to Atlanta, Charles
ton, New Orleans, Chattanooga and
Nashville, under a new arrangement I
have made for special news."
"You can pick up a good many items
now and then." Abner eyed Howard
furtively, his lips curving In a triurn
phnut smile. "We are much obliged
for telling us about Poitou, an' I wish
we was in the shape to do you a like
favor. Now and then a big item falls
on a weekly like our'n, hut, as you kin
well see. we couldn't afford to divide
with the big dailies. You see, the At
lanta paiiers witl he on the streets here
in the morning, for instance, before we
can get ours wrapped and distributed.
We are in this tiling for ail tliar is in
it, an' we don't want to print stale
news if a fresh variety lies ready at
hand."

Reymond whistled softly. "I catch
on." ho said, \yith a smile. "You hare
some news now. I can tell by the way
yon chuckle. Uncle Ah. Say. don't you
(hink you could tip me off?"
Not on tills. Frank." Abner shook
his head firmly. "I'm sorry, hut th!s
thing is our special pie. If it was a
little squib like tiie one you have
(landed us it would he different, but
this—oh. just wait till yon see the New
Marion in the tnornin'! i don't know

"I call that dog mean, Uncle Ab,"
Reymond laughed good uaturedly, "and
yon will feel had if I hold hack a
piece of news from you some day. So
long. I must go."
At the foot of the stairs Reymond
met L'ole Baker going up.
"Is Uncle Ah up thar?" role asked.
"Yes. I've just left him. Waut to
see him?"
"Yes. You remember I told you
about the fuss betwixt Howard an'
Fred Craig?"
"Y'es. and it made me anxious, for )
saw him down the street this morning.
\Ve must keep the two apart There
will he trouble if they meet."
"That is what i waut to see Uncle
Ah about," Role went on. "He's wor
tied, too, and I can set his mind at
test for a few days auyway. Craig
bas just gone to Nashville. His sister
is sick and telegraphed him to come
up. For once in ids life he was sober.
Maybe the two will cool off by the
time he gits back. 1 hope so anyway."

CHAPTER XII.
A Hard Blow.
S he was walking past the pub
lic wagou yard in the next block
Reymond saw Tarp circulating
about among the groups of men
and women and children gathered about
their wagons, and he paused for a mo
ment to watch the active young mer
chant. Presently Tarp left the yard
and approached Reymond.
"You've caught me at it." he smiled.
'This is the soil of work that I can't
trust to my help. Nobody knows as
well as I do how to honey-fugglo
mountain men and women, especially
women. I can just take one sweeping
look at a farmer's wife or daughter
and tell whether they are looking for
hats, dressés or cloaks, and 1 always
put in a word that stirs their curiosity
and makes them crazy to get to my
emporium of utility and fashion.
"If I think a woman wants a hat I
just tell about what a wonderful trim
mer Miss Bessie Williams from New
York is and what a stunning dresser
she is, and they'd rather see her than
the president's wife. 1 notice yon come
down from the Clarion office." Tarp's
eyes held a faroff look of anticipation
as he spoke. "Anything new on tap?"
"Something has happened, but I
don't know what it is." Frank answer
fed- "They don't act fair with me. J. J.
1 put them on to every bit of news I
scrape up. Look how I worked for
them at their big dinner, and yet when
they run on a plum they eat it seed and
all."
Tarp's eyes shone. He reached out
and took hold of Raymond's lapel and
thrust a Unger through a buttonhole
"That's a fact. You do telegraph news
to city papers, don't you? I had clean
forgot it. Of course important, real
important news would he a feather in
your cap. I see. 1 see. And it is a
shame if they are so greedy that they
won't divide. Now, on this special
piece o' news"—
Tarp hesitated and dropped his
glance to the toe of his shoe.
"Do you mean that you know what
it is?" Frank asked eagerly.
Tarp's profile was now toward the
inquirer. He seemed to wear a sort
of hesitation that was unusual with
such an outspoken individual.
"Well, you know, it is like this," he
said gravely, twisting his-fingers more
vigorously in the buttonhole "I am

claimed.
doing even more for the new firm, for
they have increased their circulation
enormously and print a respectable
sheet. So naturally. I reckon, they do
sort o' talk free like to me about what
is coming, knowing that I keep a lock
on my tongue, as you might say. Still
when it comes to a matter of public in
terest like the fine Dit of news they've
got ready for tomorrow's' issue—well
they ought to divide. If they see tit to
he hoggish I'm not so mighty sure that
I am called on to eat out o' the same
trough. This is going to bother me
some, Frank, fur when foul play is he
ing enacted about me 1 don't like it
I like them fellers, and I'm willing to
buck them: hut they have no right to
gobble up news that ought to he free
as winds that blow over level ground."
"I'm glad you feel that way. .1. I..."
Frank said warmly, "and. sinee you
happen to know what they've got up
their sleeve, why"—
"Oh. I'm not beholden to them." Tarp
interrupted. "The shoe is on tiie other
foot, i'm here to state. They didn't
tell me not to mention it either. 1 have
made no promises aud if I -tell you my
conscience will he clear. The item
really is a big one—a whopping big
one. The only thing I'm afraid of is
that half my customers here in town
may grab picks and shovels and cut
out licketysplit for Elktown and leave
me in the lurch.'"
"Elktowu?" Frank repeated. "Has
anything happened over there V
"Has there? Good gosh! Say, Tobe."
—Tarp was calling to a negro man who
was slouching past with a sack of flour
on his shoulder—"where did you buy
that?"
"Webb & King's." the negro replied,
sheepishly, as he faced toward the
questioner.
I kuow." Tarp smiled derisively.
"That is the Golden Glow brand. They
are selling it at 90 cents a sack, while
we. are getting rid of whole ear lots
to our customers at 80. Tobe, some of
these days you t oons will learn where
to do your trading."
"Maybe so. boss," the negro answer
ed, humbly, and moved on.
"Say, J. L.. old man"— Reymond al
most with suspended breath returned
to the topic in a pleading tone—"you
will tell me about that thing, won't
you? I may be able to do you a good
turn some time."
"I don't care if I do. Frank. I'm
a great hand to stand out for fair
play. And. as I look at it, it wouldn't
do Howard and Daniel a bit of harm
to have that news spread all over tlte
civilized world. They will get the
cream of it, anyway, for I understand
they've got a long, detailed account
of it."
Thereupon the merchant gave an
adroit version of the matter, much to
the satisfaction of the listener, who,
when be had heard the whole story,
fairly panted with excitement.
"It is great, isn't it?" he cried. "I
heard about that buried gold when I
was a little t<)t at my mother's knee.
And to think that it has come to light
at this late date!"
"Yes, it is ail right, I guess," Tarp
said, with the faraway expression in
his eyes. "But, after all. it may not
he located, for no living man may be
able to unravel , the letters painted on
the rock. I'd put them in my re
port in proper order, if I was you. It
will make the article more exciting.
Folks in this day and time are anx
ious to get hold of any sort of a puz
zle, especially if there is something to
be made by it"
"The letters—oh, I forgot," Reymond
broke in. "Of course I ought to have
them. But iiow could I get hold of'—
"Oh. you see, Frank, I took the trou- j
ble to remember them." Tarp said, as
he drew a slip of paper and a pencil
from Ids pocket and wrote in the palm
of his hand. "Here they are in due
order: 'T. D. G. A. G. M. E. 85. M. S.
D.'"
"Arc you sure you got 'em right?"
Frank asked as lie carefully copied the
letters in his notebook. "I wouldn't
make a mistake for anything. This will
create a big sensation all over the
country."
The letters are all right." Tarp
wiped a slight, impulsive smile from his
lips. "They could stand for a thou
sand things as well as one and folks
are going to be badly mixed up as to
the true meaning. By the way. Frank,
while you were confabbing with Ab
and Howard did they happen to say
how they liked the—the—well, the way
the article they got was—was shap
ed up?"
^ y.* i
"They didn't go Into that part." The f
face of the merchant was set in a
mask of expectancy ns the reply came.
But if the style was not all it ought
to be." Reymond added, "Howard could
sfijape it up. He knows how to scratch
out and write in,~l tell you. He writes
as smooth as goose grease on any topic
of current interest." i
"He'll let that article stand as It
came iu!" Tarp spoke without think
ing. "I mean—that Is, I judge from all

at the toi» notch—breezy, full of ginger.
It Is of good length, too, 1 understand,
and got up by a writer that knows how
to sling ink if—if lie does reside in the
backwoods."
"Well, I'm much obliged to you, J.
L.; 1 really am," Frank said gratefully
as they parted in front of Tarp's estab
lishment. "I'm going straight to the
telegraph office. You bet I'll heat those
wires. I'll pile it in ou them too. The
big dailies don't mind paying for real
news. They may wire me to go post
haste over there. If they do I'll get a
fast horse and make a dash for the field
of action."
Tiie next morning at 10 o'clock the
Nev Clarion in great damp stacks was
heilig folded, wrapped and addressed.
"Ain't she a jim dandy!" Abner ex
claimed to Howard and Miss Lizzie
Swayue as he held the front page up
and eyed it with delight for the twen
tieth time. "A body could read that
'buried treasure' line across the publie
square."
Half an hour later the paper wai
being sold on the streets, a thing which
had never happened before in the his
tory of Darley journalism. A negro
with a hell carried a banner on hi*
shoulder bearing the words, written
with a marking brush dipped in lamp
black: "Extra! Great News From Elk
town!"
A little white hoy with an armful of
papers, timid in Ids new occupation,
was at Ids heels.
Abner walked along the opposite side
of the street, a smile of triumph oa
lis face.
"Yell out, thar!" lie ordered. "What
did we tell you to say?" As he drew
near Tarp's store Abner saw the mer
chant pasting half a dozen of the froot
pages of the paper on tiie outside of t«,
plate glass show window.
"Hey. what's this?" Aimer asked, de
lighted. as he paused, his hands In the
pockets of his trousers. "Stealln' our
thunder, eh?"
"Y'es." Tarp's eyes gleamed oddly.
"It is big piece of news, Uncle Ah. it
may shorten your sale on the street a
little to have it stuck up for so many to
read for nothing, hut it will draw at
tention to the bargains iu the window.
Folks are bound to stop to look, and
my hoys will invite 'em in."
"Have you read it clean through?"
tYbuer inquired.
"Have 1? Oh, yes, yes. I wasn't
too busy for that, and I'm here to state.
Uncle Ah, that it is simply great"
"Y'es, good piece o' news," Abner
agreed. "Jest look down the street.
Thar is a hunch o' folks reudiu' it in
every store door an' on every corner.
Look! Thar goes a nigger on a dray
with his kinky head buried iu it."
"It is not only fine news, hut—hut

"Oh, you did?" Abner's face kindled
expectantly. "You were in it, of
course."
"No, thank God, 1 wasn't In fact,
nobody was in it at the time it was

"Struck! What was struck?" Abner
cried.

buying lightniu' rods—old members for
an' young ones agin it—when tlie storm
came, it was terrible. Ab."
Abner stood like a man drifting into
stupidity. "Nothin' else lias happened
over tliar, then, except the storm an'
the meetin' house? I mean, of course,
within the last three days."
"As for news, 1 can't think of a thing
just now. Thar is a big excitement In
our neighborhood"—
"Oh, tliar is? " Abner saw the straw
and clutched it.
"Yes. hut it don't seem to me to lie

Thar Is a big talk about churehin' old
j Peter Tomlinson. It is whispered
about that lie slipped up whar Tim
Barnett had been splittin' fence rails

"Then you buin't hoard any other

"Nothin' else. Ah. An' ef 1 was in

"No, I'll keep that out. In fact, I
won't mention the durn thing at nil.
Well, I'm much obliged. Bill."
"Sold! Sold!" Abner said under his
breath as he walked away. "Some

Hetty Green'* Firmness.
Hetty Green neurly brought Collis P.
Huntington to ruin once. She had
$1,000.000 deposited in one of his hanks
and found that he was using the
hank's money in investments that she
regarded as ticklish. Besides, there
had been deals in which she thought
she had cause to make Huntington sit
up and take particular notice of lier.
She appeared before an officer of the
hank, a Mr. Stewart, and said:
"I'd like my money right away—not
in checks; In cash, please."

messengers laid to carry it for her. the
