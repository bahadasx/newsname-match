French Gain Foothold in
Three Important Villages.
(ft the IatessisiAsaI News serued
London, sept. &.-In an all-day bat
tle in which. according to an estimate
of the Kaiser war office, not less
than 640.000 allied tr were en
gaged, the Franco-=ritish forees on
the Somme today kept hamering
away against the German lines, the
British with Ginchy as their imme
diate goa% the French aiming at
crushing in the Barleux-Chaulnes
arm of the now famous salient.
The French again seored a series of
highly important successes. The re
sault of the British efforts was rela
tive. They hold all of their new
ground gained since the 'big push"
was resumed on Sunday.
Qen. Poch's troops hammered their
way forward along their whole line of
attack south of the Somme between
Belloy-En-Santerre and Chilly. They
gained a foothold in each of the three
villages, the possession of which is
vital to a drive enmasse against Pe
ronne. These are Belloy-En-Santerre,
Vermandevillers and Chaulnes.
They captured the greater part of Bet
loy-En-Seaterre, penetrating as far as
the southern section of the town's once
beautiful pork. now a gruesome field
of carnage.
In Vermendevillers they established
themselves firmly in the northern part
as far as the road to Estrees.
And third, they took the outskirts of
Chaulnes village, which represents the
southwestern tip of the salient that is
being gradually crushed in.
This whole advance presents a serious
menace, not only to the fertreas of Per
onne. but also to the great German rail
way center Roye. not far to the south
we.t. which is thus threatened with being
outflanked.
There weresn( infantry actions on the
Franco-German front north of the Bom
me today.
The Brt:sh war office this afternoon re
ported the completion of the seizure of
Leuze wood, near Ginchy. The Germans
concentrated their energy against the
lritish today in counter-attacks between
ihat wood and Combles.
