SLETTERS FROM THE
PEOPLE
Algiers. Ia.. Sept. 5. 1916.
The Algiers Herald, City:
Gentlemen-Some days ago a presi
dent of one of our big railroads, made
a statement that the eight-hour de
mand of the railroad men was arro
gant. excessive and ruthless. A few
days later when the strike was called
off, he made the following statement:
"I am sorry the strike has been called
off and also sorry that the question
had not gone to a critical test." If
one of the employees made such a
statement he could easily be excused
on account of his ignorance, but when
a man of his standing, who has gone
through all the colleges of this coun
try, makes a statement as above, he is
not only affected with arrogance, ruth
lessness, and excessiveness, but is in
my estimation tainted with insanity,
for a railroad president to be sorry
that the whole nation was not thrown
I into an almost civil war is a proof to
the American public that he has not
the interest of the nation at heart, but
is only looking at the question from
the dollars and cents side of it. 1
would suggest that a lunacy comnmls
sion he appointed to examine this
president's mind and if he is found in
sane we will excuse him for the state
ment. but will request that lunacy
commissoin to remove him from the
public on the grounds that he is a dan
gerous man to be allowed at large.
This statement is made for the benefit
of the public, in this locality that
might have time to read it.
Veery truly yours.
T. G. HAYES.

VALLERY F. BARRAS WILL GET
APPOINTMENT.
As the incinerating plant is nearing
completion, great interest is being
taken as to whom some of the ap
pointees will be for the new positions
which will be available within a short
time.
As already chronicled by The Her
ald several weeks ago, Mr. O. V. Ver
nuille will have charge of the plant.
and Mr. Vallery F. Barras, who is a -
son of our present street commissioner. -
Judge Alex Barras. will also receive
an importaht appointment in the
plant.
The Algiers people should feel a cer
tain amount of pride in the fact that
the first incinerating plant of the city
is being erected in our district, and we
will move just one step forward from a
sanitation standpoint. Our sincere
congratulations to the Mayor.
MOTHERS! HEED THIS APPEAL.
The Silent Helpers' Circle of the
King's Daughters and Sons have had
a request for infant's clothes from a.
young woman, whose husband has de
serted her, leaving her entirely desti
tute, and she is, therefore, unable to
provide for a visit from the stork.
which is expected very soon.
Mothers who read this, and whose
own little ones have outgrown their
first little garments, will you not pass
on what you no longer need and so
contribute to the comfort of the little
stranger? If so, please notify Miss
Sarah E. Pearson. 245 Verret street
or ring up Algiers 288-W. Thank you
so much for we feel sure some one
will answer our appeal.

ings department at Washington, D. C.,
