The attendance has been good and much
interest is being shown.
A man in a neighboring town while
on the way to borrow liist neighbors
paper waa struck by lightning and
instantly killed. A warning to the
wise ahould be aumcient.
There are many striking examples
of the value of good roads. Wherever
roads have been permanently improved
it is found that there lias been a very
great Increase In value of tic adjacent
property.
Mr. William I toys ton, one of the best
judgea of atock in the county, and a
well known and prominent farmer of
the eastern section, bought last week
of John Wiley, two mule colts, for
which he paid $105, and 3 cclvcs that
cost him $100. He also purchased three
mule colts of J. 11. Woods for $240, and
one of Stirling Davia for $80, a nice
one of William Marahbanka for $100.
Educated minds in these days can
best meet life'a requirements. Hence
it is that parents are anxious to give
their sons and daughters every ad
vantage of discipling their minds that
ia so freelv meted out in our public
schools, and that auspicious time dawn
when our High School hold forth
opportunities as never beforo for young
ladies and gentlemen to acquire a good
practical education for every day use
at a very amatl expense.
A town ia like a large family. We
are all interested in each other'a wel
fare, cr ahould be. A cut-throat, ev-
ery-man- for- himself policy means ruin
for any community. It means retro
gression and failure. The first lesson
that any family must learn is that to
be happy and aucceasful is unity and
mutual assistance. The same applies
to the business life of a town and the
more generally it is obeyed the more
abundant will be tho town's prosperity.
Stand by each other and patronize the
home folks.

CHAMPION SILO BUILDER.
Mr. Charlie Polndexter, the champion
alio builder and prominent citizen of
Marcellus, passed through our city yes
terday, with n force of about twenty
men an I several wagon loads of alio
forma, on his way to Silver Creek
where he is to erect two huge concrete
alios for Mr. Jonas Wagers of that
aectlon. Charlie ia one of our valued
subscribers and stopped long enough
yesterday to "hand us that dollar."
SCHOOL OPENED MONDAY.
Our school opened Monday under the
most favorable auspices. The audi
torium was filled with pupils, patrons
and friends. Itev. F. M. Tinder
opened the exercises with prayer and
Itev. II. S. Hudson gave the Itiblical
reading. Short talks were made by
Messrs Cochran, Tinder, Ileazley, Dr.
Amon and the new Superintendent.
I'rof. 1. H. Hopkins. The attendance
waa splendid for the first day and has
been increasing daily.
The students, Individually and col
lectively, speak in highest terms of
I'rof. Hopkins and his methods of
teaching, and this atone is one great
step forward, to have so soon, gained
the good will of those whose future
lives and destinies he will yield such a
power.
The able board of trustees have set
tho wheels in motion and it is now left
with the citizens of our county as to
whether it shall continue to moru and
become an important factor for good
In this community. The High School
is the best equipped of any graded
school of ita size in the state. The
opportunities for your chidren are prof
fered freelv and it is yours to accept
them with profit. Every boy and girl
n this world has a place they can suc
cessfully fill. The place is here and
the only requisite is a fitness to fill it
and our schools are the greatest aid to
the acquiring of this fitness. See that
your children attend school regularly
and keep up with their work and you
not only help them, but their teachers
and the community in which they live.
GOOD PRICES REALIZED
At Hasfiden Brothers Stock Sale.
The farm and stock sale of Haselden
Brothers which took place at the farm
on the Stanford road last Friday
brought out one of the largest crowds
ever seen at a Bale in the county.
Auctioneer Capt. A. M. Bourne seemed
at his best on this occasion and by his
hard work and good judgment of the
value of stock, the prices realized were
satisfactory to his employers. The
farm waa not sold, although a genuine
bid of $120 an acre was offered.
WATER PURE AT
GRADED SCHOOL.
Samples of the water from the cis
tern used at the Graded School were
submitted to the Experimental Station
at Lexington, also to the State Board
of Health at Bowling Green, both in
stitutions reporting that they found no
evidence whatever of pollution and pro
nounced it pure.
THINKS HUGHES
HAS A CHANCE.
Mr. W. T. West, one of our promi
nent local Republicans, had a seat on
the platform at tho Hughes rally at
Lexington last Tuesday and tella us
that one of the largest political gather
ings he ever attended was on hand that
day. Mr. West has been the leader of
his party in this county for several
years and is of the old line type. We
don't think much of his political proph
ecies however, for he tells us that
Hughes looks like a winner.
REV. S. H. POLLITT

WELL IMPROVED.
The farm of B. F. Itobinson, located
on the Lancaster and Danville pike in
Boyle county is offered for sale in this
issue, the sale to take place on Wid
nesday September 20th. , is said to be
one of the most productive farms in
that section, beside being one of the
best Improved ones. Land adjoining
this farm has recently sold around the
two hundred dollar mark and if ' the
purchaser gets this one for much less
her will have a bargain. Mr. Itobinson
tells us the farm wilt positively be
sold.
DOGS WORST ENEMY
OF SHEEP INDUSTRY.
In some parts of Kentucky, there are
practically no drawbacks to the Bheep
industry. The lambs are in the main
marketed so early that the stomach
worm nan very little show.
The dog is, no doubt, the greatest oh
Steele with which the sheep man has to
contend; however, there are farmers
who have had po losses from dogs In
yearj. The dogs do more damage to
flocks which are pastured near the
small towns of the State, and in some
regions cause terimc losses.
A little attention on the part of the
farmer to tht ewe flock, together with
more stringent dog laws, would ml
tlgate a great deal of the loss caused
by dogs. An animnl such as the sheep,
which Is profitable In spite of neglect.
and In spite of the dogs, surely deserves
a small percentage of the amount of
attention ordlnarly given to less prof
(table animal.

Think Dick's River Dan Will Famish
Enough Electric Power For Slate.
Judge J. G. Greenleaf and Hon L. R.
Herringlon, of Richmond were in
Harrodsburg this week looking after
their interest in the Dick's river dam
project. They have just completed a
diamond drill operution to ascertain the
character of the sub stratum of the
river bed, taking out the core, or
borings, as the shaft was sunk.
It develops that the river fljws above a
solid rock foundation extending down
200' feet, which msKes the proposed
dam site an ideal one. This is the last
of a great number of tests extending
over a period or six years to determine
conclusively the feasibility of the
project, nnd the promoters are satisfied
with every test. It is estimated that
the plant when completed will be able
to furnish 2,800 horse power the year
around, or practically enough electric
power to furnish light and power for
the whole state. Danville Advocate
EDISON FOR WILSON
Lifelong Republican And Ardent Supporter
Of Rooserelt Now Strong For Wilson.
In announcing his intention to
support and work for the re-election of
Woodrow Wilson.'Thomas A. Edison,
lifelong Republican and ardent support
er of Theodore Roosevelt, dictated the
following:
"Not since I860 has any campaign
made such s direct call on Simon-pure
Americanism. The times are too seri
ous to talk or to think in terms of Re
publicanism or Democracy. Real
Americans must drop parties and get
down to big fundamental principles.
More than any other President in
my memory Wilson has been faced by
a succession of tremendous problems,
any one of which decided the wrong
way would have had disastrous conse
quences. Wilson s decisions ao far
have not got us into any serious trouble
nor are they likely to.
He has given us peace with honor.
This talk about the United States be
ing despised is nonsense. Neutrality is
a mighty trying policy, but back of it
are international law, the rights of
humanity and the future of civilization.
"Roosevelt was my choice. He has
had experience and Is one of the best
of Americans, but the machine-con-controlled
Republican party would not
have him. Therefore I am for Wood-
row Wilson."
