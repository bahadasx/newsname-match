TALK BY MRS. BROWN
New York Lady Declare* if the Suf
fraglats Are to Win Their Fight for
Votes for Women in This Country,
Both the Federal and State Cam
paign Must Continue Unabated in
Accordance With the Present Pol
icy of National American Woman
Suffrage Association—Plan Opposed
by Miss Clay and Mrs. Harper.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J„ Sept. 6—If
the suffragists are to win their fight
for votes for women in this country,
both the federal and state campaigns
must continue unabated in accord
ance with the present policy of the
National American Woman Suffrage
association, Mrs. Raymond Brown of
New York declared in an address here
today at the organisation's conven
tion. Only by united action directed
toward both federal and state leg
islation may the ultimate object be
attained, she said.
Mrs. Brown defended the associa
tion's policy in a three-cornered de
bate in which her opponents were
Miss Laura Clay of Lexington, Ky„
who favored abandoning the federal
fight and concentrating on state cam
paigns, and Mrs. Ida Husted Harper
of New York, leader of the "federal
amendment" forces, desiring that the
state tights be discontinued.
Describing equal suffrage as "the
liveliest political issue before the pub
lic," Mrs. Brown alluded to the state
campaigns which have been fought
and won, resulting in a growing num
ber of men being elected to congress
by the votes of the women.
"When the last group of states
was won in 1913 and 1914, the federal
amendment came into the immediate
foreground of national politics," Mrs.
Brown continued, "and there is no
doubt it is going to be passed before
many years. When it has been passed
by both houses of congress, however,
the fight has only just begun. Not
a woman will be enfranchised until
it is ratified by three-fourths of all
the states. This means that it is
of the utmost importance t o
strengthen our state organizations."
The national association, having in
troduced the federal amendment must
now stand behind it and never cease
working for it, Mrs. Brown declared.
Speaking as the leader of the states
rights force, Mrs. Clay said fighting
for suffrage through seeking national
legislation was "difficult and precar
ious." Alluding to how military co
ercion was necessary to make some
of the states ratify the fourteenth
and fifteenth amendments she con
tinued.
"The Susan B. Anthony amendment
is a repetition of the fifteenth amend
ment with the substitution of the word
■sex' for race, color or previous con
dition of servitude. Before it can be
come law it must be ratified by the
legislation of 36 states. It is hardly
to be supposed that the co-erced states
now will subscribe voluntarily a prin
ciple which they rejected formerly.
"In view of these enormous differ
ences, added to by the likelihood that
our organization cannot continue its
advocacy of the Anthony amendment
without involving itself in partisan
politics," Miss Clay concluded, "I be
lieve it is wise for our association to
work only for such federal legisla
tion as does not require from the
states the surrender of any portion
of those rights reserved to them by
the constitution."
Mrs. Harper, as the leader of the
"federal amendment forces" declared
that the association should concen
trate on the Susan B. Anthony federal
amendment and the work in the indi
vidual state be discontinued.
"We have now obtained enough
equal suffrage states to make pur
measure a national issue," Mrs. Harper
said, "to force its indorsement by
the platform of all five of the parties
to persuade a political candidate to
declare for the federal amendment
which his party was too boss-ridden
to favor, to compel the president of
the United States to reverse his own
attitude completely and defy the plat
form on which he was elected; and
to wrest from a reluctant congress a
vote in both houses and to scare it
so badly that it has resorted to every
subterfuge known in that body in
order not to put itself on record again
before election.
"Have we not now reached a point
where we can stop these minor at
tacks on our opponents' right and
left wings and march our forces
straight up to the congressional
trenches, where the main body of the
enemy He concealed?"
Mrs. Harper named as opponents
"the corporations, the liquor and other
vice interests."

Hindenburg Views the
Situation as Favorable
AMSTERDAM, Sept. 6.—(Via
London 11:45 a. m.)—A telegram
received here from Berlin says
that in view of the forthcoming
convocation of the reichstag
there was held yesterday a con
ference between Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg and the party
leaders. The chancellor declared
that Field Marshal von Hinden
burg, chief of the general staff,
and General von Lunderdorf,
the field marshal's chief of staff,
agreed that the military situa
tion was favorable. It was said
there was no thought of rasing
the age limit of liability for mili
try service. Confidence was ex
pressed in the success of the
new war loan.
A BIG FEATURE
CARPENTERS WIN FIRST PRIZE
AND PRINTERS CARRY OFF
SECOND HONORS.
SPECTATORS CROWD THE STREETS
The weather conditions, while not
ideal, were quite satisfactory for the
I^ibor day parade Monday morning.
The skies were overcast and a rather
cold wind was blowing, but once the
long column was in motion the march
ers enjoyed the crisp weather. And
the parade was all the committee in
charge had promised, too. The va
rious organizations were all uniformed
and as a whole presented a very fine
appearance. The procession was close
to a mile long and on Main street,
through the whole of the business dis
trict, the sidewalks were lined with
interested spectators.
The Prize Winners.
The first prize of $50 for the best
turnout and appearance of any union
was captured by the carpenters, while
the printers' union took second prize.
The carpenters had a beautiful float,
a house, part log and part bungalow.
On the porch a charming young lady
was seated. Had there been a prize
for floats, the bartenders would sure
ly have won it. Their float was a beau
tiful conception, most artistically
worked out and was admired by every
one.
The hod carriers had a novel float
that attracted much attention and the
printers had a very beautifully deco
rated auto.
With Harry Wieringa as marshal
and George Foley and Fred Munger
as aides, the parade moved from First
avenue onto Main street at 10 o'clock.
It was headed by a platoon of police
with the officers of the Trades &
Labor council and speakers, followed
by the carpenters, who made a splen
did showing, th?ir float following. The
plumbers came next, each one carry
ing a nickled rod. Then came the
printers, attired in red and white caps,
red neckties and blue shirts and white
trousers, with colored umbrellas. J. A.
Gilluly of the Argus, and Congressman
Tom Stout, of the Democrat-News, led
the printers and allied trades. The
Lewistown band came next, followed
by the bartenders with their beauti
ful float. Then came the painters,
the brewery workers, barbers, cooks
and waiters, hod carriers and elec
tricians.
tricians.
Second Division.
The second division was headed by
the B. P. O. E. trumpet corps, repre
sentatives of the K. of P. lodge, the
laundry workers, the blacksmiths, who
had a little band of their own, brick
layers and plasterers, commercial
travelers, railroad men, miners and a
long line of autos.
The line of march was a long one,
extending from First avenue to the
court house and out on Seventh ave
nue to Broadway, with a swing to
Eighth avenue: thence over to Jan
eaux and back to Seventh avenue and
onto Main street, where the line coun
ter-marched to First avenue.
THE ADDRESS.
The formal program incident to La
bor day was carried out on Main
street, between Third and Fourth ave
nues, Monday, beginning right after
the parade. Before the noon hour,
the weather had become quite threat
ening and the speakers shortened their
addresses somewhat. The first speak
er was Attorney Edgar J. Baker of
Lewistown, who was introduced by
W. E. Purnett, chairman of the gen
eral committee. Mr. Baker devoted his
time to briefly outlining the develop
ment of the union idea and its effect
in bettering the conditions of labor j
throughout the world. Unionism, he
declared benefited the employer and
the employe alike.
Mr. Baker introduced as the speaker
of the day, Hon. J. M. Kennedy of
Billings, who declared that the unions
were of benefit to any community, not
only for their effect in bringing labor
up to a higher standard and ushering
in better working and living conditions
but in their general effect upon the
life and business of the community.
The unions should be encouraged and
helped by the business interests, for
the benefits would continue to be dis
tributed among both. Mr. Kennedy
paid a fine tribute to the dignity of
labor.
Mr. Baker then introduced Hon. B.
C. White, who spoke for the farmers,
saying they were greatly pleased with
the development of the unions and
hoped for (heir continued growth and
prosperity. Mr. White described con

WILSON IS FORMALLY NOTIFIED
LONG BRANCH, N. J„ Sept. 2.—
President Wilson formally accepted
his renomination here this afternoon
with an address recounting the legis
lative record of the democratic party,
a vigorous defense of his Mexican pol
icy, his dealings with the European
belligerents and an outline of his
view of America's obligations for the
future.
With the members of the notifica
tion committee beaded by Senator
James, grouped about him at Shadow
lame, the summer White House, the
president declared the republican party
was "just the party that cannot meet
the new conditions of a new age" and
that the day of Little Americanism
when "methods of 'protection' and in
dustrial nursing were the chief study
of our provincial statesmen" was past
and gone.
"We can no longer Indulge our
traditional provincialism," said the
president. "We are to play a leading
part in the world drama, whether we
wisli to or not. We shall lend, not
borrow; act for ourselves, not imi-:
tate or follow: organize and initiate,!
not peep about merely to see where
we may get in."
Speaking of his diplomatic negotia-;
tions with the European belligerents
the president followed a declaration
that while property rights might be
vindicated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental rights
of humanity never could be, witii this
statement:
"The record is clear and consistent
throughout and stands distinct and
NATAL RANCHER
ROBERT FISCHER, RESIDENT OF
MONTANA FOR 25 YEARS, BE
COMES DESPONDENT.
LOSS OF STOCK CAUSE OF SUICIDE
Robert Fischer, a rancher in the
Natal section, Tuesday afternoon
committed suicide by hanging himself
from a ladder in the granury on t lie
ranch operated by his brother.
Mr. Fischer was horn in Germany
about 41 years ago coming to this
country and direct to Montana 25
years ago. For a number of years
he followed placer mining in the vi
cinity of Helena and about six years
ago came to the Basin, locating in
the neighborhood of Moccasin. About
one yeur ago he joined his brother
Albert, in the purchase of some lands
owned by Gene Howe and William
Abel and since that time has engaged
j j 11 stock , raising ^and ranching. Al
bert Fischer, brother of the deceased,
in discussing the death of his brother,
attributed same to despondency,
brought about by the losses of stock.
Mr. Fischer is unmarried and is |
survived by his brother Albert, who
was his ranching partner, and an
other brother residing at Joliet, Car
bon County. The body is now at
Creel's undertaking parlor. Funeral
arrangements will be made today.

wishes to know the truth about it."
Immediately afterward he said:
"1 am the candidate of a party, hut
I am above all things else an Ameri
can citizen. 1 neither seek the favor
nor fear the displeasure of that small
alien element amongst us which puts
loyalty to any foreign power before
loyalty to the United States."
Regarding his Mexican policy the
president reiterated that the people
of Mexico were struggling "blindly
it may he—and as yet Ineffectually"
to free themselves from alien inter
ests "some of them Americans press
ing for things they could never have ,
got in their own country," and that lie
would do everything in Ills power to
prevent anyone standing in their way.
"it is a hard doctrine," he said,
"only for those who wish to get some
thing for themselves out of Mexico."
At another point the president said:
"Mistakes 1 have no doubt made in
this perplexing business but not in
purpose or object." He declared at
another point:
"I am more interested in the for
tunes of oppressed men and pitiful
j women and children than in any prop
erty rights whatever."
: At the outset of his references to
the legislative achievements of his
j party the president enumerated the

IF1ND COPPER
NEAR HELENA
STRIKE IS CONSIDERED MOST IM
PORTANT EVER MADE IN
HELENA'S HISTORY.
HELENA, Sept. 6.—-Ore, carrying
leaves of native copper as broad as a
man's hand as well as good values in
silver and lead, has been broken into
at a depth of 60 feet in the shaft of
the Looby group in Grass valley, near
here, under the lease and bond to the
Cruz Consolidated Mining company.
The strike is considered the most im
portant ever made in the history of
any Helena mining district, for if the
values continue, it foreshadows the
development of a copper camp at
Helena. In addition to the native cop
per, bunches of cobalite ore were also

"What other party has understool

to stimulate it and put it upon a new

have not suggested."
At the conclusion of his review of
the party record ttie president de
clared :
"This extraordinary recital must
sound like a platform, a list of sail
guine promises: but it Is not. It is
a record of promises made four years

he said: "We have in four years come

WINNETT IRRIGATION COMPANY
MAKES AN IMPORTANT AN
NOUNCEMENT.
IT WILL IRRIGATE 15,000 ACRES
llolinboe, secretary. |
An announcement was made by the
Winnatt irrigation company yesterday
1 lint their project which covers 11,000
acres of land In Buffalo and Box Elder
creeks, northwest of the town of Win
nett. will lie completed tills fall.
The completion of this project will
lie a mark in the development of
eastern Fergus county. To the fore
sight and enterprise of Walter J. Win
nett belongs the credit for the under
taking of this project. About four
years ago, in spite of local discourage
merits, construction of the danm,
dilclies and other workings was com
menced. Since that time work has
progressed in an orderly manner and
the stockholders are now about to
realize the fruits of their labors. Dur
lug this four-year period, without is
suing bonds and without borrowing one
emit from any hunk, Ibis co-operative
company lias constructed approximate
ly 55 miles of ditch, constructed a
reservoir, utilizing War Horse lake,
which now contains 27,000 acre feet
of water, and a secondary or storage
reservoir with a capucity of 4,500
acre feet. The storage reservoir Is
known as the lleur reservoir. The
cost to date lias been $13.50 per acre,
und it is anticipated the final eost
per ucre of the completed project will
bo lens than $14 per acre. This low
per acre cost is unusual und very re
markable and may In- uttrllmtod to
the able management of the company.
The water supply will come from
Ford und Uuffulo creeks.
It is the plan of the 40 stockhold
ers to ultimately irrigate 15,000 acres,
and this area subdivided into farm
units would provide for almost 200
families. It may be safely assumed
that completion of the Winnatt ox
tension of the Milwaukee railroad will
stimulate cultivation of these lands.
At the present time some 2,000 acres
are under cultivation and with the
positive water supply which Is suf
fleient to Irrigate the entire project,
next season unusual development will
surely follow.
