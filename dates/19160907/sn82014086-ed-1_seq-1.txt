West Indies Vote Today Perhaps.
Washington. Sept. 6. Administra
tion senators tonight had hope of
ratifying at this session of congress
the treaty to ' purchase the Danish

hours' discussion in executive ses
sion, -here were clear indications that
more than two-thirds of the senato.L
favored the purchase.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, asked for a
vote tonight, but yielded when m
furmcd that Senators Borah and Cum
mins, who were absent, desired to dis
cuss the treaty before any vote was
taken. A few senators, including Sen
ators Norris, Nelson and Thomas, Said
they thought the price to be paid was
too high. Senator Nelson, however
said he thought the price ought not to
prevent the purchase.
Among republican senators who
urged ratification of the treaty was
Senator Penrose, who declared the isl
ands should be acquired bf the United
states at once and said the price was
not too great to pay. Senator Lewis
urged immediate ratification of the
treaty and acquisition of the islands
as soon as possible.
When the senate adjourned it was
with the understanding that another
executive session would be held to
morrow and a vote on the treaty ask
f Several democratic senators said
they believed ratification would follow

Corrupt Practices Discussion Brings
Back Memories of the Past.
Washington, Sept. 6. While the sen
ate was waiting today on the revenue
bill conferees, the Owen corrupt prac
tices bill was taken up and made the
vehicle for several hours of acrimoni
ous political debate. Democratic and
republican senators indulged In per
sonal exchanges and regaled their fel
low senators with accounts of cam
pain contributions and the rewards
given some contributors in the past.
The vote to take up the bill was 32 to
14, nine republicans voting with the
majority to consider the measure and
several democrats voting against it.
Senator Owen, its author, tonight can
celled a speaking engagement tomor
row before the Ohio democratic con
vention to remain here to fight for its
adoption. It probably will be taken up
again before noon tomorrow and the
Oklahoma senator intends to keep it
before the senate until a vote is se
cured or, what is more probable, ad
journment is forced by the leaders.
Senators Curtis of Kansas, repub
lican, and Ashurst of Arizona, demo
crat, furnished the excitement of the
day's debate in an interchange which
looked for a few minutes as if it might
result in a personal encounter.
The bill would restrict campaign ex
penditures of candidates for the sen
ate, the house and for the presidency
and vice presidency to a greater extent
than existing law. Senator Curtis
argued that such a measure passed
when a campaign is half over might
work unfairly against men who have
aireadv spent the stipulated amount.
ITe advocated a more stringent law
than that nroposed and one that
would particnlarlv restrict the use of
the congressional frank to prevent
senators or representatives from send,
ing out campaign appeals at govern
ment expense. He read a letter from
Senator Ashurst to a constituent re
citing his record as a basis for sun
rort and said he understood that 70.
000 o fthose bid bepn franked out, in
violation of the privilege.
"If the senator charges that this is
a violation of the law," said Senator
Ashurst. when he got the floor, "he
his sweetbreads for brains." He ex
plained that his letter had been sub
mitted and approved by the post
mi pter-trereral and one of his assist
ants n being matter which could be
f'-anlcd and told how Former Presi
dent Taft when in the Philippines and
ih then Secretary of War Root ex
changed cablegrams at 52 cents a
word mid by the government. In dis
ni? Mr. Taft's health and a horse
hnck ride. Calling Senator Curtis the
"Pharisee from Kansas." and brush
ing aside several chairs, he strode
across th center aisle and shook his
finger under Senator Curtis' rose. Sen
ator Smoot, seated just between the
two, moved hack in mock alarm as
Senator Ashurst anproached. Senator
Curtis smiled but kept his seat.

MAY AFFECT 12,000
Union Officials Threaten Complete
Paralysis of Electric Transportation
Facilities Action Follows Interbor
ough's Refusal to Annul Contracts
Binding Men Not to Seek Wage In
creases. New York, Sept. 6. A strike was
declared at 9.30 o'clock tonight by
unionized employes of the subway and
elevated railway lines operated by the
Interborough Rapid Transit company
in this city. About 1,500 of the 11,700
carmen in the company's pay voted at
a mass meeting to quit work immedi
ately. Officials of the union asserted that,
with the possible exception of the
lines in Brooklyn, New York's electric
transportation facilities would be com
pletely paralyzed by morning. They
were confident, they said, that the
motormen and conductors on the sur
face lines in Manhattan, Harlem and
the Bronx also would strike through
sympathy.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
Interborough Rapid Transit company,
declared that with adequate police
protection the company would be able
to cope successfully with the situa
tion and "guarantee transportation to
the public." He said that only a small
number of the company's employes had
become unionized.
As soon as the strike vote was an
nounced scouts were sent from the
union meeting place to notify crews
on subway and elevated railway lines.
Employes on the "gireen car line" of
the New lork Railways company
shortly after 11 o'clock tonight, also
voted to go on strike at once. This is
one of the most important of the sur
face car lines in the city. The men
acted through sympathy for the sub
way and elevated railway employes,
whose demand for an annulment of
individual contracts binding them not
to seek wage increases for two years
was denied by the Interborough Rapid
Transit company.
Should the strikers succeed in their
threats, more than 12.000 employes will
be affected and New- Ycrk will face the
worst tieup of its transportation lines
in its history. Thus far the union has
confined its demands to the Interbor
ough Rapid Transit company and its
subsidiary surface car line, the New
York Railways company. But It 'war
intimated tonight that the strike might
possibly be extended to other compa
nies operating in the various boroughs
of the greater city. ,
Owners of every description of ve
hicles were in readiness tonight to
start a jitney service throughout the
city as soon as the traveling public
finds traffic shut off.
5,000 Strike Breakers Ready.
Chicago, Sept. 6. In response to a
Telegram from Theodore P. Shonts,
president of the Interborough Rapid
Transit company, James T. Waddell
left for New York on a special train
tonight .to take charge of the strike
on the elevated and subway lines. Mr.
Waddell has nearly 5,000 strikebreak
ers ready to man cars, he said.

ers. The Mexican flag was hoisted at
the foremast, officers in full dress
stood at attention at the gangway as
the party left the ship, and a minute

whittle played their part in the cere
mony. Statement of Day's Meeting.

at today's meeting was prepared at
the direction of Secretary Lane and
Mr. Cabrera. It follows:
"This morning's session lasted three
hours, from 10 to 1, during which Mr.
Cabrera presided. The first matter of
importance was the presenting of mu
tual credentials. In accordance with
the Mexican form of opening confer
ences, Mr. Cabrera made a declaration
of the purpose of the Mexican mem
bers of the commission, saying that It
was their duty to fulfill in every way
possible- the great responsibility cast
upon them by First Chief Carranza
and -that they all stood committed to
giving their full powers to bringing
to a conclusion this conference in
such a manner as would be most
profitable to Mexico and the United
States After that, Mr. Cabrera stat
ed that it was the desire of the Mexi
can members of the commission that
the fullest information should be given
to the commission regarding all mat
ters involved and that they were quite
ready . to meet the Americans in a
spirit of utmost frankness.
"The members of the commission
then exchanged views in general
about the situation in Mexico and
especially on the border, with the viow
to making a preparatory study of the
subject. During the conference the
commissioners reviewed the growth,
control and strength of the constitu
tional government, which has become
every day stronger during the last
two years, and in particular since the
recognition of the constitutional de
facto government, showing that order
was being established throughout the
republic, railroad service being ex
tended, etc.

as a surprise to the convention. After
it had been made by John T'. King of
Bridgeport, the name of Senator H.
M. Salmon of Westport was offered
by Representative Harry Sherwood of
his town. Colonel I. M. Ullman of
New Haven pointed out that New Ha
ven was not represented on the ticket
and, two years ago in the interest of
harmony, the county had withdrawn
any candidacies it might have had for
a place and acquiesced in the choice
of two nominees from Fairfield coun
ty, lie felt that this time New Ha
ven county ought to be represented.
The sentiment .expressed by delegates
was so clearly in support of Colonel
Ullman's position that Mr. King with
drew Mr. Salmon's name.
The platform was read by Mr. Ull
man and adopted. Then Morgan G.
Bulkeley and Charles if. Brooker
brought in Governor Holcomb, who
briefly thanked the convention for
showing its confidence in him. This
renomination is believed to shatter
tradition. Renominations for govern
or by the republicans have not been
favored heretofore.
Governor Recognizes Party Call.
Governor Holcomb said in part: "I
fully appreciate the high honor you
have paid me in selecting me for the
second time as the party nominee for
governor. The honor is all the more
appreciated as it was entirely unso
licited. I have reached that age
where I would prefer to retire from
active public and political life, but I
appreciate the call of the republican
party and recognize its right to call
upon me for service. I pledge myself
if elected and I expect to be elected
(cheers) to give my best efforts to the
state which is my native state. It is
an additional honor to be a candidate
on a ticket which has such a candi
date for the presidency as Charles
Svans Hughes, a jurist and i man of
distinguished executive ability and one
who will give the country the service
it needs. God knows that for the next ,
four years we will need a man of sane
ideas at the head of this government.
I think you."
Amid cheers the convention ended.
Many Delegates Caught Napping.
The convention today was unlike
any which the republicans had previ
ously held. Like many others its dra
matic moments came late in the day
and with a suddenness wliich caught
napping many of the delegates who
were loitering outside. It took only
a moment, however, for them to rush
in to watch and hear the display of
Tarli;iment.n.rv tactics which wora nut

THE HEALY VOTES
Shortly after the re-nomtnatlon of
Senator McLean in the forenoon the
roll calls began for governor. There
were one informal and three formal
ones and the fifth roll call .was being
completed. The absentees were be
ing given a chance to respond. The
break had come in Governor Hol
comb's direction but he was yet about
fifty lacking to get the needed num
ber. Colonel Ullman rose to ask that
the New Haven city delegation be
polled again. His desire was to switch
the Healy votes to Holcomb. On the
roll call Mr. King had changed his
own vote from Wilson to Holcomb
and many in the county had followed
suit. Additions for the Holcomb list
were many and it was easily seen that
hope of the nomination of Blakeslee,
Healy or Wilson was fading.
Sudden Break During Fifth Roll.
Former Governor Bulkeley wanted
the convention to agree to a single
ballot being cast for Holcomb but
Chairman Brandegee could not agree
to this as the roll call was not com
pleted. Colonel Ullman got consent
to have his local delegations re-polled
and as the delegations swung over,
other towns and districts asked for
the same right to vote again. When
a clear majority for Holcomb was in
dicated, Colonel Ullman renewed his
motion that the nomination be made
by a single ballot. This was done
amid cheers.
General H. C. Dwight next moved
that the present state officers be re
nominated by acclamation. It was
then that Mr. King stated that Mr.
Burnes did not desire a renomination
nd this re&'-ired re-considers .l Vr, oi' '
the Dwight motion and nominations
were made individually.
The closing paragraph of the (plat
form which was hearily applauded
reads:
"We take pride, in presenting to the
citizens of this state the Honorable
George P. McLean as our candidate
for United States senator and ithe
Honorable Marcus H. Holcdmb as our
candidate for governor, and heartily
commend them and their colleagues
on the state ticket to the electors of
this commonwealth for their suffrgae."

ALL STAMP TAXES CUT
FROM REVENUE BILL
$5,000,000 Loss Here to be Compen
sated by Increased Munitions Tax.
Washington, Sept. 6. Elimination ol
all stamp taxes in the emergency rev
enue bill, seriously objected to by the
house, was agreed upon late tonight
by the conference committee, house
conferees yielding in exchange for this
concession their demand for restora
tion of a tax on refiners copper.
To make up for the loss of about
$5,000,000 revenue in sacrificing the
stamp taxes, the conferees are expect
ed to agree to a suggestion of house
members that the net profit tax of
manufacturers of munitions of war
be increased from ten to twelve and
one-half per cent.
Plans of administration leaders to
adjourn congress tomorrow night
when the conference committee on the
emergency revenue bill indicated that
it could not reach an agreement until
tomorrow at the earliest. The report
may not be ready before Friday and
adjournment may be delayed until
Saturday.
Although the conferees worked far
into the night, much of the bill was .
left for consideration tomorrow morn
ing. Senator Simmons, chairman of
the senate conferees, said he believed
an agreement would be reached in
time for presentation to the house
soon after it meets at noon.
But' the revenue bill Is not all that
is delaying adjournment. In the sen
ate a filibuster has developed against
the passage of the corrupt practices
act and various senators are clamor
ing for consideration of minor bills.
The general deficiency bill still Is be
ing held up in conference until a re
port on the revenue measure has been
made and in addition to these obsta
cles, leaders of both houges expect
that general debate on the revenue
bill conference report will occupy
many hours. Senator Kern, the ma
jority leader, said after reviewing the
situation that he did not look for ad
journment before Saturday.
Predict End of Epidemic Soon.
New York, Sept. 6. Health depart
ment officials announced tonight that
persons who recovered from infantile
paralysis previous to the present epi
demic had contributed, more than seven
gallons of blood to be used as serum
in the treatment of cases now In hos
pitals. The steady decline in the number
of deaths and new cases, excepting to-,

to report some cases on Sunday and
Monday last, has strengthened the be
lief of the authorities that the epi
