ED HUNTER FOR
A Practical Farmer Who
Has A Practical Solution
For County Problems
Why not a practical farmer for
Supervisor? If he has -made a
success on the farm by practical
farm methods, is it not a fair pre
sumption that he would apply
practical farm methods to the con
duct of the public busiries?
Ed Hunter of Williams has
demonstrated that successful agri
culture is possible in Coconino
county. Many have doubted it
and many doubt it yet. Go talk
with Ed Hunter and he will give
you an insight into the sort of
farming that will enable a farmer
to make good in Coconino county.
It is such men as Ed Hunter who
develop a country and put the
basic industry, farming, on a
sound founda ion.
Ed Hunter believe3 in alfalfa
possibilities for northern Arizona.
He is an alfalfa enthusiast. He
not only talks alfalfa but he raises
it. If others will do likewise, the
Arizona cattle men and sheep men
will have less difficulty in getting
their stock thru the winter.
Ed Hunter will talk county
economics to yon, too, and he is
as sound on economics as on farm
ing, and that's what makes it look
like i sensible thing to do to vote
for him at the primaries next Tues
day. He is hard headed when it
comes to finance and he will be
very apt to block any game which
looks crooked. And he will insist
on a full days work for a days pay
end full measure for the price the
people pay.
Look up Ed Hunter's name on
the democratic ballot and put your
cross after it. pdv.

A BUSINESS MAN FOR SUPERVISOR
The crying need of Coconino
County is a better business sys
tem. The expense of government
is too great and public improve
ments cost too much, The only
way to get a better business sys
tem for the county is to elect bet
ter business men to the Board of
Supervisors. Williams offers a
candidate for the democratic
nomination for Supervisor who
is entirely competent to help in
augurate a thoroly business sys
tem for the administration of the
county's affaiis. That man is G.
B. Kirkpatrick, manager for the
Postal Telegraph Company and
as such, in charge of the import
ant and extensive business of
the Williams station.
By education and profession,
Mr. Kirkpatrick is an Electrial
Engineer. He early developed
constructive ability which secur
ed for him uniform advancement
in the work of his profession,.
His services were in demand by
telegraph and telephone com
panies in the field of organization
and construction.
Mr. Kirkpatrick's professional
and business record is as follows:
For 18 years he filled important
positions in Boston, Mass. For
7 of these years he was Electri
cal Engineer for the Western
Union Telegraph Company. For
3 years he had direct supervision
of the Pacific Telegraph & Tele
phone Company's toll lines in
Southern Calif., covering a terri
tory of over 500 miles. For the
past 5 years he has had super
vision of the Postal Telegraph
Company's plant of Arizona
which extends from Albuquerque
N. M. to Mojava, Calif.
Mr. Kirkpatrick is a western
man identified with the develop
ment of Arizona's industrial and
commercial interests and especi
ally of those of Coconino county.
A close observer of the workings
of local government, he sees its
short comings and is competent
to h.lp very materially in mak
ing such government more effi
cient and economical.
Mr. Kirkpatrick is a public
spiriten citizan, willing to devote
his time to the solution of muni
cipal problems. He is at present
serving his second term as a
member of the Williams Town
Council. His large business ex
perience and broadminded out
look make him a strong member
of the Council, just as they would
make him a strong man on the
board of Supervisors. Adv.
JAMES KENNEDY FOR
JUSTICE JFTHE PEACE
How would James Kennedy do
for Justice of the Peace for Wil
liams? He has-been .in Coconino
county for thirty years. "" Every
body knows him and he' knows
everybody. He has had experience
in public office and would not be
a novice. He was City Marshal uf
Williams for eight years,. Deputy
Sheriff of Coconino county for two
years and County Supervisor for
one term. In every instance he
performed his official duties with
credit to himself and to the office
he filled. That is a good record,
all will agree. .
Mr. Kennedy has been engaged
in general merchandising in VVil
hams for the past ten years and
he has made a success of his busi
ness. And that is a good record,
too. Were he elected to the office
of Justice of the Peace, Mr. Kenne
dy would give to the duties of the
office all the time necessary to per
form them faithfully and well.
He would not permit his private
business to interfere with the duties
of public office. Located in the
central part of town, he would be
easily accessible t the public.
Mr. Kennedy's long residence in
Williams, his years of experience
in public orhce and his experience
in business would, combined as in
hi.-- case, make him an ideal man
to determine the equities in the
actions usually brougtit into a
justice court.
James Kennedy is an active can
didate for the office of Justice of
the Peace for Williams and he
will appreciate your vote at the
primary next Tuesday. Adv.

A man who can take an insignifi
cant electric light plant and in a
few years by sheer executive ability
and engineering skill convert it in
to the best electric " light plant in
the state has some class as a busi
ness man, don't you think? That
is what Geo. T. Herri ngton of
Flagstaff did for Flagstaff electric
light plant. When he took hold
of it as Manager fifteen years ago
it lacked nearly everything that &a
efficient electric light plunt should
have. To-day it is conceded to be
the most up-to-date and efficient
electric light plant for its capacity
in the state of Arizona. Geo. T.
Herrington is entitled to the whole
credit for the improvement in the
Flagstaff light plant. The Flag

ings, his candidacy must appeal
etrongly to the voters of Coconino
