Continuing Tariff Board
Is Stricken Out.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept. 7.
House and senate conferees,
considering provisions of the
emergency revenue bill, this afternojn
met the wishes of the copper produc
ing states of the north and the south
west by dropping all discussion of
I
tax on copper. As the bill passed the
house recently, it contained a copper
tax provision. It was voted out by the '
s nate- The house conferees toda i
agreed to cease their demand for the
restoration of the tax when the senate
conferees threw out the stamp taxes.
Two "Reprisals" stricken Out
. M .
The conferees on the emergency
revenue bill today struck out the
Phelan amendment tj emnower the
president to retaliate against citizens
of belligerent nations which Interfere
with United States mails. The argu
ment which prevailed lu the confer
ence was that it might work great
hardships to Americans in foreign
countries by counter retaliation. -
The conference also abandoned the
Chamberlain amendment to prohibit
admission of Pacific ocean salmon or
iahbut through a foreign country ex-
ept in bond from an American port.
This. It was decided, might develop a,
ommercial war with Canada and bring
about retaliation against American At
lantic coast fisheries.
Other Reprisals Agreed To.
Other senate amendments clothing
the president with retaliatory power
against interferences with American
commerce an dembargoes on American
goods to foreign nations were agreed
to.
There was no fight on the increases
in the rates on intermediate and fin
ished dyestuffs.
Income Tax Approved.
The conference eliminated the JSOO,
ft'io continuing appropriation for the
tariff commission. Three hundred
Thousand dollars was retained for 1917
ut as the bill now stands, the appro
priation for future years was elimi

MTU ARIZONA!,
Ashurst Defends His Course i
In Franking 70,000 Briefs
of His Record.
Washington. D. C. Sept 7. Sen
ators Curtis, of Kansas, Republican,
and Ashurst of Arizona. Democratic,
furnished the excitement of a day's de
bate Wednesday In an interchange
which looked for a few minutes as
though it might result in a. personal
encounter.
Senator Curtis advocated a law that
would restrict the ube of the congres
sional frank to prevent senators or
lepresentatives from sending out cam
paign appeals at government expense.
He read a letter from senator Ashurst
to a constituent, citing his record as a
basis for support and said he under
stood that 70.000 of these had been
franked out in violation of the privi
lege. If the senator charges that this is
a. violation of the law," said senator
Ashurst when he got the floor, "he has
sweetbreads for brains."
Calling senator Curtis "the Pharisee
from Kansas," he strode back across
the center aisle and shook his finger
under senator Curtls's nose.
A little later Mr. Ashurst turned on
senator Penrose, who had noticed a
vupper lobby" around the capital
wliose members had been taking with
the Arizona senator.
"If." said Mr. Ashurst "the senator
rneans to say that my vote has been
influenced by a copper lobby or any
other lobby, he lies."
Several senators objected to this 1
language and senator Ashurst ex-j
plaired he had said "if" and agreed to I
withdraw his remark.

Declares Arbitration Failure
is Next to Abdication of
Government.
( Ha"iptn Beach. X. II. Sept. 7.
ifhailes E. Hughe?, in an address here
I toi referred to the Adamson law
i "T.ot as an eight hour a clay law. but a
I wage law." and declared that failure of
arbitration for the settlement of in
1 dustrial disputes was but "another step
from the abdication of government it
self." His audience applauded Ioudlx.
' '"We cannot afford to surrender what
1 we have won for our institutions in
this country." the nominee said. "What
nave we won? We have won the right
to free discussion, a free press, a demo
cratic form of go eminent free assem
' blage. free legislatures and an execu
: tive chosen by the people. We have left
i autocracy. We have left tvranny. We
I have left force. They shall not" come
, back if we can prevent it.
I "We have recently seen what I re
! gard as a very deplorable surrender of
' that DrinciDle. I am for the arbitration
I of industrial disputes. That is in the '
interests of labor. Labor cannot afford I
to surrender that principle.

the facts, confessedly in ignorance of
what Justice demands. It is not an

and nobody knew whether it was just
or not
"Xon. I am for justice in everythmp.
but I propose that in all we do we shall
investigate first and then legislate. Our
methods in this country are of priceless
importance to us because the are

"There is no likelihood that any class
of Santa Fe employes will receive In- ;
