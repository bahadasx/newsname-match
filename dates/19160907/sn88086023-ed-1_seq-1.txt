NEW CRISIS NEAR IN FIGHT
OVER COUNTY LIBRARIANSHIP
6H
With the first meeting of the II
brary board, since the two new up
polntments, set for this evening, therel
Ik considerable Interest as to what ao- j
tlon will be taken In the controversy
which has been willed for months
over Miss Habra I Nason, county li
brarian. It is generally auppused that the
opposition to Miss Nason will make
another attempt to secure her remov
al and. Inasmuch as the new appoin
tees ure credited with beinit in sym
path with this opposition, such an
attempt would doubtless be success
ful. As a counter the friends of Mlsa
NaSOn are making an attempt to dis
solve the present board and place the
control of the library in the haudn of
a board composed of the county court
and one member appointed by the city
council. A petition to this end hus
been circulated among the councll-
I men for the past few days by friends
of Miss Nason and the signatures of
Councilman Murphy. Kolsoiu. Kll ami
Vaughni) have been secured, accord
ing to report. If they suceed In get
ting one more signature, thus giving
a majority of the council, they will
present the petition to the county
court which Is now in session.
This change of control. It is gen
erally believed, would be a victorv for
the friends of the librarian as the two
I members of Ihe court have been vol
j lug with the pro-Nason faction al ex
J officio members of the present board,
j A question has been raised as tn
whether a board comprising the niein
J ban of the court and one city appoln
I tee Would be legal. The present board
j operates under a law which permits
the county to contract with the city.
I and another law gives the court pow
er to go Vat U a county library.
Members of the opposition faction
also contend thai the present board
cannot be dissolved except by a ma
jority vote of the board itself. How
ever, it Is sisld that the contract be.
tween the city and county could be
OaoOf Uad at the option of either.
Members of the county court are
known to be dissatisfied with the
present arrangement Inasmuch as it
practically put the county library In
the hands of city Rppnlntees.
Home people profess to see In the
present controversy a danger that the
oily libraTi will be divorced from Ihe
county library This would mean
that there would be two libraries In
Pendleton, one supported entirely by
the county and one by the city. The
county owns the new librnry build
Ing and "the ground on which It Is In
dited, the site having been deeded by
the city to the county. Tlte county
Is this year providing about 160(10
for a maintainanre fund and the citv

It is asserted by some of those
working to abolish the present bonrd
thai they are not striving to keep Miss
Nason in office but merely to put an
effects e end to the library quarrel
They sMy that only through a new .leal
may this be accomplished.
