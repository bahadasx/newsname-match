[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff

NHW LONDC^J, Conn., Sept 7.—
Extensive financial aid for Mexico
will be one of the vital problems of
the American-Mexican commission.
Every effort will be made to avoid
anything that suggests benevolence.
But If there is assurances of lasting
stable conditions below the !Rio

the flotation of a folg Mexican loan
in this country.
This was learned reliably today as
the American and Mexican commis

There were no Joint sessions to
day. Instead, the commissioners
delved into data on border subjects
and the American commissioners
planned an informal discussion of
questions presented. The American
commissioners are optimistic over
the outcome of the conferences.
