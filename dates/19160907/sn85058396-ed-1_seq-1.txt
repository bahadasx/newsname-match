II "Old Sol," coming up out of the
Ogden valley and creeping over the
1 mountain bulwarks east of Ogden this
3 morning, gazed upon the city that Is
3 to he the Mecca of pleasure-seekers
jl from many cities and towns of Utah,
S Idaho, Wyoming,- Nevada cud other
4 states during the next few days,
if The magnet is Ogden's fifth annual
i Harvest Festival and Fashion Show,
g which was opened at 10:30 o'clock
I , -with a street serenade by the Moun
i tain Echo band of Ephrlam, Utah, an
organization of twenty Mormon maids
i from central Utah,
s The three-day celebration was to
have been inaugurated by the firing
of a number of bombs at 8 a. m but
out of courtesy to the girl musicians,
,5 H. B. Ames of the entertainment com
.'1 mittee, who had the early nolse-mak-Sj
Ing In charge, deferred the bomb
shooting until a later hour.
; The band, by the way, introduced
itself to Ogden last night, when, upon
Jits arrival in the city, it marched
from tho union depot to the Reed ho-
tel, serenading all the way. After be
' ( ing housed at the Reed, the girls,
with their chaperon, Mrs. D. W. And
i ! erson, Manager J. T. McCafferty and
. 1 Conductor P. A. Young, were escorted
; to tho Weber club by officers of the
! Harvest Festival association and there
entertained at a nicely arranged sup
per. Mountain Echo Band.
The personnel and instrumentation
of the band, which was the principal
attraction of the show during the
day, are as follows:
, Da Veda Olson, Ida Peterson, Flor
ence Lundhandt, cornets; Edith
Thorpe, Elato Bjerregaard, Etta Dor-
lus Mainzet Quinn, altos; Oro Olson,
La Verna Peterson, Lucille Johnson,
i trombones; Thelma Christensen, barl-
tone; Deldee Anderson, Norman
Christensen, Lind Olson, clarinet;
Audrey Bailey, tuba; Florence
Greaves, tenor; Alta McCafferty, saxo
phone; Duenna Christensen, bass
drum; Ruth Anderson, snare drum;
Conductor P. A. Young, cornet.
I The accomplishments of the band
the twenty girls being from 16 to 20
years of age since its organization
one and one-half years ago, is a fine
demonstration of the inherent talent
of Utah girls for music. In speaking
of it this morning, Mr. Young said
that prior to the latter part of March,
1914, none of the girls had played on
a band instrument. Six months later,
under the management of Mr. McCaf
ferty, they began giving concerts and
accepting engagements ,to furnish
i danco music. In a short time, the
boys' band of Ephrlam was put out
of business and then offers of engage
! ments from other towns began to
pour in faster than, they could be ac
i cepted. Last year, the band was one
of the big attractions of the "Wizard
of the Wasatch" festival in Salt Lake
City. It has just completed an en
gagement at a hlg celebration In
Spanish Fork, Utah, and will remain
in Ogden until Sunday morning as one
of the main attractions of the Harvest
Festival. Tho girls are members of
some of the best families of their
homo town and their musical director
is justly proud of them.
Making a fine appearance in white
"middies," set off with green ties and
green and white-striped hats, white
shoes and hose the colors, by the
way, of the Daughters of tho Pio
neersthe girls began to ingratiate
theraselveB with the local public with
a concert at the Reed hotel corner.
At Candy Factory.
From that point they serenaded
1 through the business district, to the
Shupe-Williams candy factor'- The
factory was made one of their stop
f ping places, by Invitation of Manager
I W. H. Williams and the interest of
i the bew of girlB in the big "sweets"
Plant was only second to the factory
employes' interest in them. After
getting a thorough idea of how the
famous "Utahnas" are made, the mu
; slcians were each presented with a
I box of their favorite "brand" and re
: turned to their hotel in fine spirits.
1 This afternoon, tho "Mountain
I Echo" band gave another street con
cert Tonight it will act as escort to
"Fashona," queen of the festival, In
j 1 her triumphal automobile tour through
1 tho city's commercial district and will
furnish the music for the remainder
of the evening for the dancing, at tho
"jitney" dance pavilion on Hudson'
avenue. The dance pavilion will also
i ho headquarters tomorrow and Satur
day nights and it goes without saying
that the gate-keeper will take In more
"jitneys" than he ever dreamed had
i been made.
With the prospects of superb weath
er conditions, it is anticipated that the
! festival will even surpass the expect
i alions of tho committees and the
' pleasure-lovers who have been wait
ing for It. The committees will offer
' to the visitors, who began to arrive
1 in the city this morning from all dl
1 rections, more high-class free enter-
tainment than has ever before been
arranged for a celebration of the kind
in the iutermountain country. The
attractions, for which a fee will be
charged, are of a type that will be
well worth the small amount expend
ed by the patrons, and the aim of the
Harvest Festival and Fashion Show
association Is to show the visitors a
good time while they are here and to
have them go homo with a good feel
ing for Ogden and a desire to visit
the city more often.

HUGHES ATTACKS
ADAMSON LAW
Presidential Nominee Says
Eight-Hour Law Is Not Just
Speaks in New Hamp
shire. Hampton Beach, N. H., Sept, 7.
Charles E. Hughes, in an addresB here
today, referred to the Adamson law,
"not as an eight-hour a day law, but
a wago law," and declared that fail
ure of arbitration for the settlement ot
Industrial disputes was but "another
step from the abdication of govern
ment Itself."
His audience applauded loudly.
"We cannot afford to surrender
what we have won for our institutions
In this country," the nominee said.
"What have we won? Wo have won
tho right to free discussion, a free
press, a democratic form of govern
ment, free assemblage, free legisla
tures and an executive chosen by the
people. We have left autocracy. We
have loft tyranny. We have left foce.
They shall not como back if we can
prevent it.
"We have recently seen what I re
gard as a very deplorable surrender
of that principle. I am for the arbi
tration of industrial disputes. That
is in the interests of labor. Labor can
not afford to surrender that princi
ple. "We have recently had at the pro
posal of the executive an act passed
by congress confessedly in ignorance
of the facts, confessedly In Ignorance
of what justice demands. It is not
an eight-hour a day law. It is a wage
law and nobody knows whether It
was just or not. ,
"Now, I am for justice In every
thing, but I propose that In all we do
wo shall investigate first and then
legislate. Our methods in this coun
try are of priceless importance to us
because they are methods which con
ceive our peace. It is only a step from
peaceful settlement of such disputes
to the denunciation of our courts and
all the machinery of peaceful settle
ment; It is only another step to the
abdication of government itself."

NO AGREEMENT
ON REVENUE BILL
Conference Committee Reach
es No Settlement Delay
Will Postpone Adjourn
ment to Saturday.
Washington, Sept. 7. Conferees
on the revenue bill today struck out
J the Phelan amendment to empower
the president to retaliate against cit
izens of belligerent nations which In
terfere with United States mail. Tho
argument which prevailed in the con
, ference was that it might work great
hardships to Americans in foreign
countries by counter-retaliation.
The conference abandoned the
Chamberlain amendment to prohibit
importation of Pacific halibut or sal
mon through a foreign country ex
cept in bond from an American port.
This, it was decidedr might develop a
1 commercial war with Canada and
bring about rotallation against Atlan
tic coast fisheries.
Other senate amendments clothing
the president with retaliatory power
against interferences with American
commerce and embargoes on Ameri
can goods to foreign nations were
agreed to. They havo the sanction of
the state department, while the Phelan
amendment did not.
Tho conference then approached the
wine tixes and dye-stuffs tariff which
became the temporary stumbling
blocks. Majority Leader Kitchin
moved to strike out the senate amend
ments levying the duties on conl tar
products, medicinal goods and ex
tracts. There was no 'fight, however,
on the Increases in the rates on in
termediate and flplshed dyestuffs.
The conference eliminated the $300,
000 continuing appropriation for the
tariff commission. Three hundred
thousand dollars was retained, for 1917,
but as the bill now stands the appro
priation for future years was elimin
ated. The house leaders yielded to de
mand for retention of the tax on
oepper when the senate conferees
threw out the stamp taxes.
Tho Inheritance, corporation taxes
and other Incomes as fixed by tho sen
ate were retained.
NEW YORK LOCAL
TRAINSJIED DP
Interborough Rapid Transit
Manages Its Trains on Al
most Normal Schedules.
MANY POLICE EMPLOYED
Nearly 18,000 Employes Af
fected by Strike Declared at
2:30 o'clock this
Morning.
New York, Sept. 7. A million or
more of residents left their homes this
morning, not knowing whether they
would ride to work or walk. The first
test of the strike declared last night
by the union employes of the elevated
and subway railways came with the
morning rush hours on these main
arteries of travel between the two ends
of Manhattan island.
Several instances of elevated trains
being bombarded with stones and bot
tles thrown from roofs were reported
to the police shortly before 9 o'clock.
Police entered the buildings and
chased from the roofs gangs of men
said to have been seen carrying mis
siles. At 9 o'clock tie Interborough Rapid
Transit company reported that express
and local trains wero running on nor
mal schedule on both subway and ele
vated lines and with but few changes
from the regular crews.
When the workers of the city start
ed for the places of their employment
today, tho Amalgamated Association
of Street and Electric Railways which
is conducting the strlko, had been un
able to tie up the subway and elevated
lines, but had succeeded in crippling
some of the most important surface
lines. With tho aid of. nearly 3,000
strikebreakers and under police pro
tection, the Interborough Rapid Tran
sit company was running its trains on
subway and L on almost normal sched
ules. The strike of the Interborough
employes has spread, however, to the
carmen of the Now York Railways
company, which operates all save two
of the Important surface lines in the
boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx.
Approximately IS, 000 employes are
affected. The Immediate cause of the
strike is the refusal of the Interbor
ough company to release the men
from an agreement to seek no further
improvement x in working conditions
for a period of two years after the
advance In pay which the men re
ceived last month.
Besides these demands, however, Is
a contest over the unionization of the
street car workers of the city, among
whom the Amalgamated association
has gained a strong footing only dur
ing the past few months. The union
employes of the Interborough company
voted to strike at 2:30 a. m. last night.
In response to the railway com
panies' appeal for protection. 5,000 po
licemen were released from patrol
duty today and made available for
strike duty.
