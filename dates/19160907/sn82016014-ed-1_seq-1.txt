New York normal service was being
maintained today.
William B. Fitzgerald, strike leader,
admitted that 'he motormen of sub
way and "L." trains had not responded
to the atr ke call. Trains on these
lines, handling the bulk of the city's
passenger traffic were running on reg
ular schedule. Places of guards on
the cars were taken by strikebreakers
in many instances.

were not serious.
I.oyal Kmp'oycs ict Double Pay.

went to work this morning in "jit

cars of such lines as were still In oper
ation. The Interborough Rapid Transit
company operating the subway and
..locator! lines claimed that practically
all of their trains left the barns on-

hurled from the roofs but missed their
mark.
Five thousand police were on strike
duty today. From two to six uni
formed officers were assigned to every
subway and elevated station in town.
On the subway a policeman was on

protect motormen from injury In case
of attack.
Trouble Over Signed Contracts.
President Theodore P. Shonts of the
Interborough company claimed early
today that normal service was being
maintained on both the subway and
elevated system. Upwards of 5,000
strikebreakers were housed in the
various barns of the company which

was called shortly after 9 o'clock and
from then on until today it was evi

VEILED MYSTERY
OF OIL DROP IS
BARED AT LAST!
Oklahoma City, Ok., Sept. 7. Rum
ors are current among members of the
Oklahoma City Oil exchange that the
bringing in of a 12,000-barrel well in
the Hominy field in Osage county,
which has been capped and guarded
carefully from intruders, is respon
sible for the break in price of crude
oil. It is said the Hominy field will
produce millions of barrels of crude
oil.
One company controls virtually the
entire acreage of the Hominy field and
leases cannot be obtained at any price,
it is said. Little or no definite infor
mation is obtainable regarding condi
tions there. Evidence as to the extent
of the new field or what promises it
holds forth Is lacking.

guardsmen returned from the border
by the recent order of the war de
partment were today ordered muster
ed out of the federal service. The
guardsmen remaining on the border
stay there for the present.
The demobilization is understood to
be a preliminary to the withdrawal
of the punitive expedition from Mexi
co which will take the guardsmen
places protecting the border line and
is regarded as a consequence of the
assembling of the international com
mission to settle the border troubles.
The war department official an
nouncement was made in the follow
ing statement:
JT. Y. Regiment Has Typhoid.
"The secretary of war directs that
all the organizations of the national
guard in the federal service recently
ordered from the border to their re
spective mobilization camps be mus
tered out of the federal service as soon
as practicable and returned to the
normal status of national guard troops
except in the case of the Fourteenth
New York regiment which is to be
held in service at its mobilization camp
pending the prevalence in that regi
ment of para typhoid.
"As soon as it can be safely done
this regiment also will be mustered
out. Similar precaution should be
taken with any other organization re
turning from the border suffering
from any infection or which is under
suspicion of being infected."
Includes 14 Regiments.
The troops affected are three regi
ments from New York, two from New
Jereejr J.pn,fr9m MaryJand,.two. from!
Illinois; two rrom Missouri, one from
California, one from Oregon, one from
Washington, and one from Louisiana.
These units comprise in the asrerre-
gate about 15.000 national guardsmen.
ine plan for the mustering out of
the regiments will be executed under
the various departmental commanders
with whose jurisdiction these
organizations are placed. In many in
stances, where there is no reason to
hold them because of disease infection,
the mustering out will be done imme
diately. It is expected that all the
organization except the Fourteenth
New York will be mastered out as
soon as the necessary routine is con
cluded. The Yale battery mobilized at
Tobyhanna, Pa., was ordered to
Niantic, Conn., where it will be mus
tered out.

Ten Years Ago, a Dirorce for
Every Twelve Marriages.
Columbus. O., Sept. 7. For every
three marriages In Ohio last year, at
least one divorce suit was started.
For every six marriages, one divorce
was granted by Ohio courts and one
marriage annulled.
These figures will be cited in the
forthcoming report of Secretary of
State Charles Q. Hildebrant, soon to
be filed with Governor Willis, it was
learned here today.
Ten years ago Ohio had only one
divorce to every twelve marriages. An
nual reports of the former secretaries
show plainly the divorce evil is gain
ing ground in Ohio married lite.
Hildebranfs report shows it Is the
wife and not the husband, as generally
It is supposed, who tires soonest of the
marriage bond.
Many Unfaithful Wives.
For example: Exactly 299 divorces
were granted husbands last year on
the ground that their wives had been
unfaithful. Only 196 wives were
granted divorces from husbands
charged with forgetting their mar
riage vows.
However. It is the husband who
shirks married responsibility first, ac
cording to the report. Exactly 3,014
divroces were granted wives last year
for "absence and neglect," as against
1,354 granted husbands for the same
reason.
Hildebranfs report shows that June
still holds good as the month of mar
riages and that January is the month
that Cupid languishes.
Of the 48,260 marriages reported for
the year, 5,820 were solemnized in

HAYS POINTS OUT THE PATH
Says State Has Been Inconsis
tent in Rulings.
Demands Better Service and
Then Ties Firm's Hands.
Victor Hays, president of the Kan
sas Natural Gas company, today told
Rotarians the "chapter of misfor
tunes' of his company since it first
began supplying gas to Kansas. Ho
charged the state with inconsistencies
in demanding better service and then
in tying the hands of the gas com
pany, making better service impos
sible. Mr. Hays peaded for the applica
tion of common sense in deciding
whether the gas increase Is proper, or
not. When the Kansas Natural first
began supplying gas the gas came
from a field not mere than 100 miles
away. Now the company is buying its
gas from another company at an in
creased price while the gas is piped
three times as far ns it was originally.
Yet despite the millions of dollars
spent in extending mains to get the
gas, the price of gas has not material
ly increased.
The gas man also spoke of the ques- '
tion of attorney's fees. That was a
matter settled by the courts, he stat
ed. Yet the company paid $20,000
fees to a Philadelphia attorney for a
three hours' consultation, as much as
has been paid in Kansas for an attor
ney's services for an entire year.
Not a Cent In Revenue.
"The gas business is peculiar in one
respect," said Mr. Hays. "In every
other business increase of equipment
means an increase of the volume of
business. Yet, in the gas business this
is not true. We have spent millions
in new equipment and yet haven't de
rived a cent more in revenue."
Mr. Hays spoke of being obliged to
purchase gas in Oklahoma from an
other gas company at 6 and 7H cents
against 2 and 2 hi cents a few yemrs
ago. He told of the increase in the
price of equipment which he estimated
at 79.6 per cent.
Inconsistency of State.
In pointing to the alleged incon
sistency of the state, Mr. Hays told
of the company s anticipation or need
ing new gas territory in the years to
come aiiu ui ils uliiuii hi iraoing ici-
ritory for the purpose of opening'
fields.
"About that time the state brought
a suit against us charging us with
being a trust," said Mr. Hays. "That
threw us in a receiver's hands and our
attempts to safeguard ourselves
against a gas shortage ended."
