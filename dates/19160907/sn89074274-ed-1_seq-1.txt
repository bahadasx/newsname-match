Grand Forks, Sept. 1.—A telegram

of George A. Preston, formerly of this
city. Another message was received
by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. W.
Preston, stating that he had met his
death by a fall from a window in the
Nicollet hotel. Further particulars
are still lacking.
The young man has been making
his home with Mr. and Mrs. Erick
Swain, at Gilby. His parents in this
city were not aware that he had gone
to the citie#at all until they received

yesterday. Upon inquiry it was found

Mercedes, Tex., Sept. 1.—"If we
were called on to cross into Mexico, a.
motor ambulance would be of the
greatest value to us," said Captain A.
B. Welch, of Company A, First North
Dakota, discussing today North Dako
ta's campaign to raise funds for the
purchase of an auto ambulance. "The
mules drawing afield ambulance can
just about carry water enough for
their own use, which leaves the am
bulance crippled when it is needed to
carry the sick or wounded. I am
greatly desirous of seeing a motor am
bulance unloaded at the Mercedes sta
tion some afternoon soon.
"It will be of great immediate ser
vice. Our field hospital is a good
quarter of a mile from here, and
There is no malaria at the North
Dakota camp, in spite of the clouds
of mosquitoes which settle down on
the camp every night. The recent
rains, followed by hot suns, have fill
ed the lower Rio Grande valley with
mosquitoes. In some.of the nearby
camps malaria has appeared. Orders
to sleep under mosquito bars have
been issued and quinine is liberally
issued as a preventive.
Much good as the strict discipline is
doing the North Dakota soldiers—and
you ought to see their faces and feel
their biceps—it isn't always received
with gratitude. There are youths who
lived easily and well at home and it
does them good to lie under their mos
quito bars at night and plan in detail
what they will do when they go home.
One of them last night unfolded a pro
gram designed to reward him for every
objectionable thing he had to stand la
Mercedes.
"I am going to hire a fellow to
come to my room every morning and
play the bugle," he said. "I won't pay
any attention to him and he will yell
like a top sergeant: 'Hey, what's the
matter down in that tent? Going to
sleep all day?" Then I will get up
and pull on my shoes purely for the
purpose of delivering a neat kick to
the bugler. Then I shall go back to
bed and sleep until 10 o'clock.
"At 3 o'clock each afternoon I shall
stand talking to friends in front of the
capitol and this hired man will come
along with the leather leggings and an
officer's cord. Instead of saluting him
I shall walk over and slap him on the
back and ask him what he wants to
drink.
"When I go home in the evening I
shall not sit down to the table imme
diately. I'll get my mess kit and ex
amine it critically, and if there is a
speck of dust on it I shall raise Cain
with the maid. Then I shall line up
at the kitchen stove and have my mess
kit filled. If the appearance of the
food does not please me I shall throw
it into the fire and demand what the
cook meant by fixing things that didn't
suit me. I wish we had a man cook
at home. It seems a shame to fright
en a girl. But I will have my dad pay
her extra for the trouble I give her.
"My hired man's third duty $s to
come ,down to a crowded corner at
9:30 o'clock each night and play the
call to quarters. When he has finish
ed it I shall walk over to him and box
his ears and threaten to take his bu
gle away from him.
"Great Scott! I wish I could get
home and start on this."
