The National Ameilcan Woman
Ht'ffrage association by an over
whelming vote today decided to con
tinue its present policy of working
for ennui rights through both national
and state legislation, 'lho vote was
taken after a long debate and no
sooner had tho applause that greeted
the announcement of tho action ceased
than a resolution was presented
which threatens to again open the
whole question tomorrow.
Virtually all tho speakers declare
for strict neutrality in Die presidential
campaign and to rontluue the non
partisan efforts of the m-sot lutlon to
bring about equal suffrage through
out the I'nlted States.
Women from every state In the
union are attending t!irt forty-eighth
? initial convention of the association,
which was called two luonths In ad
vance of tho regular meeting because
of the national presidential campaign.
Two Amendments.
The question of policy came heforo
the convention In tho forir of two
proposed amendments to the organi
zation's constitution, (mo proposed
that the association drop work oil
state legislation and concentrate on
the proposed amendment to the fed
eral constitution. The other provided
that the association cea.se Itf efforts
In behalf of tho federal amendment
nn.l confine Its activities to getting
woman's suffrage by states. Tho
amend 11, ents were defeated by a viva
vr.ee vote in whicn few affirmative
voices were heard. Then Mrs. Currle
Chapman Catt, president of the asso
ciation, presented tin following reso
lution: "That the forty-eighth annual con
vention of the National Suffrage as
sociation interpret article 2 of the con
stitution which pledges our auxiliaries
to secure the vote for women by ap
propriate national and state action aa
meaning that the federal amendment
Is our immediate and principal aim;
and that all state campaigns whether
legislative or referendum are prepara
tory to this end."
Act ion Is Attacked.
Miss Laura Clay of Lexington. Ky.,
1 staunch advocate of (tali's rights,
Immediately attacked the resolution
as undemocratic und us nullifying the
action Just taken by tho convention.
The resolution stirred up opposition
milling other delegates and there was
every evidence of a stormy session.
A motion by Miss Clay that the reso
lution be laid on the table was de
feated and then further debate was
shut off by the carrying of a motion
made by Miss Hannah .1. Patterson of
Pit tshurgh, Pa., corresponding secre
tary, that tho resolution be made
special for 11 8, 111. tomorrow.
Mrs. Catt and other leaders In her
Administration anticipate a lively de
bate, but expressed confidence that
tho resolution will be adopted-Tlii-cc-Corncrei!
l'lght.
There wns n three-cornered debate
on the policy question. Miss Clay
led the forces who favored exclusive
state action; Mrs. Ida Husted Harper,
New York, was the principal speaker
for concentration on the federal
amendment, and Mrs. Raymond
Urown. New York, made the principal
address In favor of no change In
policy.
Mrs Catt opened the discussion nnd
amused the delegates hy Mating that
('harks K. Hughes, the Republican
presidential nominee, had told her
that the Republican platform came
rearer to what the suffragists want,
than trot of the Democratlo party,
end that on the other hand President
WMson told her tin Democratic plit
foi m wns nearer to woman suffrage
than the Rrnul Mean plt'foim.
She said both presilentlal candi
dates were fsr ahead of thetr respect
ive parties In their views on the suf
frage question.
Miss Kat" Hordon. Louisiana, sec

for exclusive sinte work; Mrs. f!en

the first fill 11111I conference hero to
day by the Mexican and American
commlsnloners appointed to bring
about an amicable and permanent
settlement of International difficul
ties. A summary of tho proceedings
Issued at the conclusion of the moet
Ing alluded to the de facto Mexican
government as having 'every day
stronger during the last two years
und In particular since tbe recogni

mary agreed upon by -Luis Cabrera
and Franklin K. ljine, chairmen of
the Mexican and Auteiieuu delega
tions, respectively, follows:
.Makes Hivlurallon.
"This morning's session lasted three
hours, from lu to I, during which Mr.
Cabrera presided. The first matter
of importance was the presenting of
mutual credentials. In accordance
with the Mexican form of opening
conferences, Mr. Cabrera made a
declaration of tho purpose of the
Mexican members of the commission,
saying It was their duty to fulfill In
every way possible the gt eat respon
sibility cast upon them.
Have Mopes for Hot.
The commissioners sent to President
Wilson and to Oeiieral Carranza the
following message:
"The American and Mexican Joint
commission, In addressing Itself to the
task assigned to It, desires to aend
to your excellency moat cordial greet
ings and to express the holm that its
labors will be productive of results
satisfactory to both countries.
Secretary ljine and Ids associates
are evincing a keen interest In tne
alms and purposes of the constitution
uliht party in Mexico as set forth by
tho Mexican delegates. The Informa
tion thus gained, it Is said, may have
an important bearing on the specific
agreements which tho commissioner
may reach later.
Withdrawal Conies llrst.
While the subject of the withdrawal
of the American troops from Mexico
und related mutters, such as the for
mulation of a protocnl to cover futiii'v
military opera 1 1011s along the border,
will be disposed of first, It appears
certain that assuranc -s by the Car
ranza government of full protection
for tho rights of Americans In Mexico
will hold an equally important place
lu the eyes of tbe American commis
sioners. I''iring tho recc-s the American
commissioners will study war and
Mate department reports en to the
situation on the border. The Mexican
commissioners also hava at hand com

Senators Curtis of Kansas, Repub

might result in a personal encounter.
The bill would restrict campaign
expenditures of candid. iioh for the

dency nnd vlce-presldencv to 1 great
er extent than existing law. Senator
Curtis argued that such a measure
passed when a campaign Is half ovr
might work unfairly against men who
already have spent the stipulated
amount. He advocated a more string",
ent law thnn that imposed and rno
that won'd particularly restrict the
use ef the eiugressloinl frank. He
;oi d n letter from Senator Ashurst to

"If the senator charges that this is
a violation of the law," said Senator
Ashurst when he got the floor, "ho

aisle and shook his finger under Sen
ator Curtis' nose. Senator Smoot,
seated Just between the two, moved
back in mock alarm as Senator As

"If," said Mr. Ashtiist, "tbe senator
means to say that my vote has been
Influenced by a copper lobby or any
other lobby, he lies."
Several senators objected to this
language and Senator Ashurst after
explaining he had said "if," agreed to
withdraw his remark.
Several senators told of large con
tributions to campaigns In various
states. Senator Owen said former
Representative A. Mitchell Palmer of
Pennsylvania had staled that I750 0i0
was spent in Ihe Pennsylvania elec

that Mr. Palmer's statement had
never been supported by evidence and
declared he could give better proof
that several hundred dollars had been

mary campaign which resulted In
