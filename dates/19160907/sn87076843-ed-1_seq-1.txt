On Friday evening last two
' young men from Toledo borrowed
a Ford delivery enr from a friend
for a drive. On coming in the Mc
Cutcherville road the ear jumped
off the road and turned over in
the ditch, with the two men under
neath. Harry Alexander of Indianap
olis, and A. E. King of Sandusky,
were the occupants of the ear, and
King is now recovering in the
Rhoiufrank hospital from a few
broken ribs and a broken shoulder.
Alexander escaped with .slight
injuries and returned to Toledo
after being fixed up by the doctors.
The Ford was a badly wrecked
car, but will probably recover
after the owner spends about $100
for professional .services.
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL.
Sylvester Fanner was attacked
by newsboys at Jackson and
Huron streets Thursday afternoon.
He suffered a deep cut on the right
hide of his head. Police Sergeant
Cook sent Farmer to St. Vincent's
hospital. The assailants disap
peared. Toledo Times.
Farmer is a conductor on the
Maumce Valley electric line.
TO THE MEMBERS OF ZOAR
LUTHERAN CHURCH
Much criticism, both public and
private, has been registered of late,
because on Centennial Day in my
"Historical Sketch" I failed to
mention Zoar among the other
Churches of the village. It is only
fair to you and myself to state, that
I had the data all at hand, but in
some mistakable way, in making
a final copy failed to put it in.
Neither were our public schools in
any way mentioned for this same
reason. Of course all will under
stand that this was entirely an
oversight and that it was far from
intention to neglect to mention or
in any way underestimate the im
portance in this community of Zoar
Lutheran Congregation.

During the rush of business inci
dental to the Chautauqua and Cen
tennial the improvement of Front
street was laid on the shelf and it
is now too late to do the work be
fore winter arrives.
But the project has not been
abandoned and arrangements are
about to bo made whereby the
street will bo placed in passable
condition for the remainder of the
year, and all necessary legislation
will bo had for the purpose of
commencing the work of rebuild
ing the street early in the spring.
.UNINTENTIONAL OMISSIONS.
Try as much as possible to do
otherwise, we found it impossible
to avoid missing a few of the inter
esting features of the" Centennial
parade in our report in the last
issue. However, it is very grati
fying to know that all fair minded
people realize' that such omissions
were unintentional on the part of
the editor.
Among the many splendid fea
tures of the second division none
received more attention or praise
than that of the W. O. W. Circle,
which was a well designed and
decorated float, done in the sym
bolic colors of the order, with the
Circle's little mascot, Miss Irene
Sweet, and twelve ladies represent
ing the order present. The Circle
ladies aro very active in their
lodge work as well as their many
deeds of kindness extended to
those worthy and in need.
Champney's Pharmacy was an
other we missed. Although Mr.
Champney was busy as an aide to
one of the Marshal's he did not
fail to have his business house rep
resented in the Industrial division
with a neatly decorated automo
bile, bearijig banners announcing
his business and the fact that it
was established in 1SGG one of the
oldest established business houses
in the village.
Mr. A. A. Robert's grocery was
also in the parade with a display
that was a credit and an indication
that he is one of the live business
men of the village.
FORGET YOUR ACHES.
Stiff knees, aching limbs, lame back
make life a burden. If you suffer from
rheumatism, gout, lumbago, neuralgia,
get a bottle of Sloan's Liniment, the
universal remedy for pain. Easy to
apply, it ponetrates without rubbing
and soothes the tender flesh. Cleaner
and more effective than mussy oint
ments or poultices. For strains o-
! sprains, soio muscles or wiencneu
ligaments icsulting from strenuous cx-
' orcise, Sloan's Liniment gives quick
lclicf. Keep it on hand for emer-
I gencies. At your Druggist, 25c.

SELECT SEED
Now Is the Best Time to Choose
the Choice Ears.
Are you going to wait till spring
to pick out seed ear for your next
corn crop? Although this may be
a custom, the experience of the
most .successful growers shows that
seed selected from standing corn in
the fall yields nunc than corn
taken from the shock or crib. By
fall selection the best ears growing
under ordinary conditions may be
chosen. By selecting sued either at
husking time or from the crib, the
grower picks out ears that grew on
unusually fertile spots or often
with a single plant in a hill. The
Ohio Experiment Station has ob
tained gains in yield of more than
three bushels per acre by selecting
seed in the fall from standing corn.
Circular 71, which may be obtained
from the Station at "Wooster, gives
tho points io look for in choosing
seed ears in the field.
STOP THE FIRST COLD.
A cold docs not get well of itself.
Tho process of wearing out a cold
wears you out, and your cough be
comes serious if neglected. Hacking
coughs drain tho energy and sap the
vitality. For 47 years the happy com
bination of soothing antiseptic balsams
in Dr. King's Now Discovery has
healed coughs nnd relieved congestion.
Young and old can testify to tho effect
iveness of Dr. King's Now Discovery
for coughs and colds. Buy a bottle to

Editor Journal :
I have read with much interest,
also pleasure, the series of articles
printed in the Journal in the past
few months on events that hap
pened in dear old Perrysburg in
the early days of its history, and in
later years, and thinking that per
haps a few pergonal recollections
of events that have taken place
there in the past fifty years may
be of interest to your readers, I
will endeavor to jot down a few.
My earliest recollections of
school days in Perrysburg go back
to 1SCG fifty years ago. It was at
the time that the old brick school
building which was destroyed by
fire some years ago was being
remodeled by having an additional
story added to it, niaking it a
three-story building. During the
.alterations to this building, the
younger or primary scholars at
tended school at several places.
One of these temporary primary
schools was located in a frame
building on Front street near the
corner residence of the family of
the late Enos Griss, and was occu
pied in later years as a residence
by Miss Anna M. Ladd. This pri
mary school was presided over by
a Mrs. Swigart, who, I think, at
that time resided in the building
with her three children, two little
girls and a little boy. Tiie pri-
Imary scholars residing in tlie east
I ern end of the town mostly attend
ed this school. The other primary
school was held in the building
now occupied by the Journal, but
the building, was at that time
located further up on the north
side of Front street, at the head of
"Walnut street. This building had
at one time been used as a store
by the late S. N. Beach, Adjoin
ing this on the east was a wagon
building and paint shop owned by
Valentine Schwind, who still re
sides in the burg. Across the
street on tliCjCorner of "Walnut was
the large livery stable owned by
the late Major II. C. Lawrence.
This primary school was attend
ed mostly by scholars living in the
southern and western part of the
town. The teacher at this school
was Miss Carrie M. "Wilkinson, who
was afterward Mrs. Earl "W. Mer
ry. Among the scholars whom I
personally recollect as attending
this school at this time, besides
my older brother and sister, were
Geo. llirth, Alfred Ilirth, "Will Wil
kinson, "Wallie Thompson, Fred
Dodge, Frank Mahr, Christ Zaeng
er. Fred Zaenger, Howard Reid,
Jinunie Reid, John Roach, Ed.
Roach, Gottleib "Walter and John
Schwind. Some of those who I
think attended this school at this
time, but as to whom my memory
is a trifle hazy, are Joe Price, John
Price, Frank Witzler, George
Knoll, Charlie Cook, Hamilton
Cook, George llillebrand, Joe
Seibert, George Seibort, John Col
lier, Joe Zeisler and Lewis "Webb.
Of course there was quite a large
number of girls attending this
school, but as somo of them no
doubt have not grown old as rap
idly as some of us "boys," I will
forbear mentioning any names, but
a number of them are still living in
Perrysburg and vicinity, and I met
several during tho "Home Com
ing" week of two years ago. Sov

The most dangerous humidity
during a heat wave is the kind that

"We trust that no jealously will
be aroused between the "Central
Empires" by Senator Penrose's
disclosure that Ambassador
Gerard obtained his Berlin post
for only $13,o00 whereas Vienna
was made to look like $23,000 to
Mr. Penfield.
The Kaiser couldn't be much
busier patching things up'.if he had
a campaign, for re-election on his
hands.
The heat wave at last put a
silencer on the summer resort

Japan is also increasing its navy,
not necessarily for war, but as a

civilization.
Now the ilaw picking season is
upon us, and the political orators
are harvesting a bumper crop of
flaws.

The Democratic leaders were
about to defeat the naval program
when the president explained it to
them in the light of a pork barrel
measure for political purposes,
whereupon it went through with a
whoop.
The passage of the S-hour law
by congress, by order of the presi
dent, has postponed the big rail
road strike. It's a great adminis
tration which bows obedience to
the demand of an organization that
threatens to paralyze the business
of tho country unless a law is
passed forcing employers to ac
cept an S-hour day for a 10-hour
pay.
