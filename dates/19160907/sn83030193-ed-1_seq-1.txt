De Lancey Nicoll Declares
Compan yWill Never Abrogate
the Individual Contracts.
SHONTS GIVES SURPRISE.
Says Directors Agreed ,Not to
Send Out Agreements, but
Hedley Didn't Know.
The Publlo Service Commission at
tempted to-day to Intervene In tho
strike altuatlon with the object of
bringing about quickly some kind of a
mutual adjustment that would restore
trafllo conditions, but it met with
small success.
It subpoenaed both President
Shonts of the traction companies and
Organiser Fittgcrn'J of the union and
examined them under oath as to the
causes leading up to the strike.
Fltrgerald was asked In view of the
fact that ho had suggested and In
sisted on Inserting In the agreement
between the surface line company nnd
Its men, signed on Aug. 7, that all
questions In dispute should bo sub
mitted to arbitration, why a strike
was now in progress.
Fltzgernld mado a long explanation
seckng to Justify his disregard of tho
agreement, and charged the company
with first breaking It.
To President Shouts the commis
sion presented the statement of Gen
eral Manngor Hedley at a conference
with tho men that ho regarded the
agreement made with tho men of the
surface lines as applying to subway
and elevated employees, giving them
tho right to organize, and asked
whether this policy had been car
ried out.
"When It was reported to mo," re
plied Shonts, "I said that It I had
been tlioro I would have taken the
same position."
"lias tho question been submitted
to tho directors?" was askod.
"The matter has never been dis
cussed." To Organizer Fitzgerald the Com
mission put tho question whether tho
men would be willing to submit to and
abide by whatover ruling or decision
might bo made by tho Commission
after Its Inquiry Into the situation.
Fitzgerald replied that, personally,
ho was willing, but that he would
have to consult first with the men,
nnd, therefore, could not give a di
rect answer.
Do Lancey Nicoll, speaking for the
Interborough lo regard to submit
ting to u decision by tho Commis
sion, Hnld:
"What, submit tho question of our
right to make individual contractu
with tho men7 Certainly not. Tho
Public Service Commission has no
authority In tho case. Ilcsldes, thore
Is no strike on either suuwuy

Tho commission's Inquiry developed
the tact that tho mala Issue between
company and employees Is over these
contracts which have been circulated
and signed up by n mpnber of men on
tho subwny and U lines nnd aro about
to bo circulated among surface car
employees. It wns this speclflo point

Young Jones Is One Up on
Gardner at End of First
18 Holes.
(Special From a Staff Correspondent
of me tvening world.)
MEKION CIUCKKT CMJII, Haver-
ford, Pa., Sept. 7. Hobby Jones of
Atlanta, fourteen years of ago and
every Inch a golfer, fought llobert
Gardner to a rfntidstlll In tho third
round for tho national golf title hero
to-day and ifnlKhed one up on tho de
fending champion at tho end of tho
first eighteen holes.
Jones llnlshc'd tho round in 78
strokes against Gardner's 79. The
Southern "Infant," playing with the
skill nnd confidence of a veteran,
gained tho whip hand on the Inward
trip nnd forced the national cham
pion to make marvellous shots to
savo himself on threo different holes,
especially at tlsr thirteenth, whore
Gardner ran down a 25-foot putt for
a half.
Jones had n lead of two holes at
the seventeenth, but missed his drive
on the homo hole, which gavo Gard
ner a chance to cut down tho lead,
A gallery of S.000 braved tho bak
ing eun'to follow tho match. Tholr
Interest was centred chlotly In "the
kid," who from a distance on the
links looked no bigger than his
caddie.
Jones, wasting little time, won the
first two holes when Gardner missed
putts. The cjiamplon came right
back on the 427-yard third, where the
Southern marvel hit Into a bunker
on hie second shot, a mlstako which
cost him tho hole. Gardner also cap
tured tho long fourth nnd fifth holes,
when Jones again played Into trouble
Tho champion was very brilliant on
tho 420-ynrd sixth, a tremendous cleek
shot going so true that a 10. foot putt
earned n great 3 to 5 for Jones.
At this time Gardner was 2 up,
and many In tho gallery wero begin
ning to doubt tho youth's ability, but
after .squaring the seventh Jones
won tho eighth when Gardner missed
a short putt.
On tho short ninth Jones ran down

"The strike Is broken. Nino thou

Those are tho men who signed the
Individual contracts with us. About

Those men have thrown over the

Broken.
DOUBLE PAY FOR MEN -
WHO REMAIN LOYAL
All union employees of the Third Avenue surface hlnes
were ordered to get ready to strike at noon, and the strike
will spread to that system before many hours elapse. It
is expected that the union employees of the Union system hi
the Bronx and the men on the Queens tines also will go out.
While the subway and elevated services appear to be
running up to normal standards and the morning rush hour
crowds were handled in good shape, police and tractitn
officials advise that all who can should leave for home early
this afternoon in order to distribute the rush hour crowd
over a longer period than usual.
General Manager Hedley claimed this afternoon he was
operation ninety-three trains in the subwly at 2 o'clock,
an increase of 10 per cent, over' the, non-rush hour require
ments. ,
President Shonts of the Interborough said thir afternoon
that only 500 strikebreakers were needed to man trains in
the subway and on the "L."
The New York Railways Company will not attempt to
operate the green surface cars after sundown. General
Manager Hedley promises to maintain night service In the
subway and on the "L" sufficient to take care of the north
and sou.h overflow from the discontinued surface systems.
Organizer Fitzgerald of the street car men's union ad
mits that the subway and "L" motormen did not strike, but
he insists that 4,000 other employees of those lines went
out. On his own figures two-thirds of the employees re
maincd at work.
The green car surface lines are about 85 per cent
tied up. The cars in operation are manned by veteran em
ployees.
No disorder of any consequence had been reported up
to noon. Bricks, garbage and bottles were thrown at cars,
but no one was injured. Subway and "L" motormen wers
protected by heavy wire screens.
Officers of the American Federation of Labor announce
that there is a project on foot to raise $1,000,000 to help
along the strike.
The greatest inconvenience due to the strike was felt
by persons who cnic downtown in automobiles. Fifth Ave
nuc and Lafayette Street were jammed with cars, and the
absence of traffic policamcn on Fifth Avenue threw that.
thoroughare into traffic chaos. .
Interborough officials have asked for extra protection
for their power houses. ,
