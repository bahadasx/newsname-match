SUPPOSED TO INDICATE
PUNITIVE FORCE'S RECALL
Pant-Typhoid Infection in 14th New
York Infantry Delays Its
Demobilization.
The Secretary of War today
directed that all organizations of
the National Guard in the federal
service which were recently or
dered from the Mexican border
to their state mobilization camps,
with one exception, be mustered
out of the federal service as soon
as practicable and returned to
their normal status as National
Guard troops.
The exception is that of the 14th
New York Infantry, which is to be
heid in service at its state mobiliza
tion camp because of the prevalence in
that regiment of para-typhoid. As soon
:is it can be safely done, it was said
."t the Secretary's office today, that
regiment also will muster out. It was
announced that a similar precaution
shall be taken in the case of any other
organization returning from the Mexi
can border which is found to be suf
fering from any infectious disease or
which is under suspicion of being in
fected.
15,000 Hen Affected.
The demobilization, which will af
fect about 15,000 national guardsmen,
is understood to be preliminary to the
withdrawal of the punitive expedition
of regulars from Mexico sent there
under Gen. Pershing to capture the
Mexican bandit. Villa.
This punitive expedition. It is under
stood, will take the places of the 15,000
national guardsmen, now to be demob
ilized. who have been protecting the
Mexican border line at various points.
The order is regarded as a conse*
quence of the assembling at New Lon
don. Conn., yesterday of the Interna
tional commission to settle the border
troubles between the United States and
'Texico. For the present, other Na
tional Guard units on the border will
? ray there.
The troops affected are three regi
ments from New York, two from New
? rsey. one from Maryland, two from
Illinois, two from Missouri, one from
' 'telifornla, one from Oregon, one from
Washington and one from Louisiana.
Immediate Muster Out.
The plan for muster out of the regi
ments will be executed under the vari
ous departmental commanders within
w hose Jurisdiction these organizations
: re placed. In many instances, where
there is no reason to hold them be
? a use of disease infection, the muster
i .g out will be done immediately.
It is expected that all organizations.
cept the 14th New York, will be mus
?red out as soon as the necessary rou
? e is concluded.
The Yale Battery, mobilized at Toby
anna. Pa., was ordered to Niar.tlc,
? onn, to be mustered out.
GBNGRBSPASSES
FAKE AUCTION BILL
The Senate today passed the Johnson
fake auction bill without amendment.
It now goes to the President for sig
nature.
In the absence of Senator Pomerene,
who had left the city for Ohio, the
bill was called up by Senator James
of Kentucky, who acted at the special
request of Representative Ben John
son of Kentucky. The chairman of the
Hoase District committee has taken a
keen Interest in the passage of this
measure, designed to prevent fraud at
a notions in the District.
There was no debate in the Senate on
the bllL
House Committee Report.
In reporting the bill to the House,
the District committee said:
"Washington seems to have become
a mecca for fake auctions. Not only
local residents, but thousands of
visitors from the states are made their
victims. It Is believed that this bill
will minimize if not entirely put an
end to their vicious operations in the
District of Columbia."
The bill makes it necessary for any
, person or firm proposing to sell at
public auction any stock or stocks of
merchandise to obtain a permit from
the District Commissioners to hold
such auction. The District Commis
sioners are directed not to iusue such a
permit unless they are satisfied that no
fraud or deception of any kind is con
templated.
A f**e not exceeding $50 must be paid
by the applicant before th* permit Is
ls*u**d. Auctions made under author
ity of law are exempted from the
operation of the measure. Violations of
the proposed la** are to be punished by
fin** of from $10 to $200 or by im
prisonment for not more than sixty
days, or both.
Urged by Retail Merchants.
The Retail Merchants' Association of
Washington was a moving factor in
drafting this legislation, and has urged
the passage of the bill persistently.
Representative Johnson was much grat
ified at the action of the Senate today
and said that he hoped the measure
would be used as a model for states
where fake auctions are conducted. He
said that he intended to do all he could
to have such a law enacted by the
Kentucky legislature.
Charles J. Columbus, secretary of
the Retail Merchants' Association, was
in the gallery at the time of the pas
sags of the bill. He expressed much
satisfaction over its passage.
4
: Clause in Revenue Bill Regard
ed as Likely to* Give
Trouble.
AIMED AT GREAT BRITAIN
AND HER ALLIES IN WAR
Republicans Charge That Proposed
Legislation Is Designed to Ap
pease German-Americans.
That the administration is cre
ating a serious menace to the
peace of the country and borrow
ing trouble through the commer
cial retaliation legislation in the
emergency revenue bill now in
conference in Congress, was the
view taken today by several far
seeing statesmen.
This legislation, directed against
Great Britain and her allies because of
interference with American trade
may be a constant source of fric
tion with the belligerent countries
of Europe, and may become an issue
in the presidential campaign, according
to the same prophets.
The charge is made by republicans of
prominence that the legislation is pri
marily intended to appease the Ger
man-American vote, and that It is a
most dangerous act because of Its poa
sibilities along political lines.
Prediction of "Pressure."
The prediction Is that President Wil
son's pen, used in signing the bill, will
hardly become dry before certain ele
ments of the country, aided by others
that, have been hurt by the British
methods, will begin to bring pressure
at the State Department and White
House to have the law become effec
tive, and if they do not succeed at
once they will make the open assertion
that the law was intended as a sop,
with no purpose to have it enforced.
If they succeed in their efforts the
country will be brought near to a break
with Great Britain and her allies.
From any viewpoint the law is a dan
gerous one, it is asserted. According
to these views, a commercial war be
tween the United States and the allies,
even if it does not lead to more serious
things, may cause the loss of billions
of dollars and last long after the war
closes in Europe.
It is stated that 45 per cent of the
exports of this country now are to
Great Britain. Once commercial retal
iation is started by the United States
there will be counter retaliation by the
allies and no one can see the end. Inas
much as the allies have a commercial
alliance, they are expected to stand to
gether against this or any other coun
try. and their alliance. It is claimed, is
designed to last many years.
"Greatest Danger" Pointed Out.
The greatest danger In the law, how
ever, it was claimed today, Is In the
friction It will create between this
country and the allies, regardless of Its
application. It will be recognised by
the allies, according to the authorities
as a club against them, and the pres
ence of that club will not be looked
upon in an amicable way.
Secretary Lansing has let it be known
that the law is not intended for use
until all diplomatic efforts have failed
to achieve results, and this is under
stood to be a notice to certain elements
that they need not rush to demand the
enforcement of the law.
Foreign Diplomats Decline
to Comment on Proposed
Retaliatory Trade Laws
Diplomatic representatives here of
the entente powers today declined to
comment on the retaliatory legislation
which has been Incorporated in the
revenue bill, now being whipped Into
shape In Congress, which would give
President Wilson the power to deny the
use of the mails, ( able, wireless, express
and shipping facilities to European na
tions at war which discriminate against
American firms by means of black lists
or otherwise.
Secretary Lansing also declined to
go into the subject, beyond denying
that the British ambassador has made
a complaint against the proposed legis
lation. Mr. Lansing was willing to say
that he had discussed the subject with
the British ambassador, but that the
nature of the conversation was not one
of complaint by the British. It Is pre
sumed that the diplomatic call which
resulted In the conversation was one of
Inquiry on behalf of the entente allies
as to exactly what the proposed legis
lation is.
In the meanwhile, the entente allies'
representatives here have allowed It to
become known that this proposed legls
lation, as soon as It becomes law by the
passage and signing of the bill, will be
taken under consideration by the great
trade council of the ten belligerent gov
I ?-rnments which it is proposed to hold
j shortly at Paris.
Diplomats Not Aroused.
There Is *a tendency on the part of
some of the diplomats here to minimize
the Importance of the threatened acts
! of retaliation, and It is indicated that
no formal action will be taken unless
the President actually puts Into force
the discretionary powers of refusing
! clearimre papers to ships discrlmlnat
| Ing against American goods and deny
ing import privileges to countries which
j restrict American trade.
Kxplaining the position of the State
Department, Secretary Lansing said it
; was not felt that the resources of dip
lomacy had been exhausted in efforts to
' remove illegal restrictions upon Amer
ican trade, and indicated that there
1 would be no disposition to put into
effect the legislative weapons unless
j an impasse actually was reached and
j the attitude of Great Britain and her
i allies had to be regarded as "un
friendly." ?
f It al?o was explained officially at the
department that specific approval had
been Riven there to only one of the
amendments to the revenue bill, that
giving authority to refuse clearance to
vessels declining to carry American
cargoes for any reason other than
lack of space.
The American embassy at London ca
hred today that the British foreign office
"will give special consideration to difficult
cases where large amounts of tonnage are
not Involved" in the negotiations of the
department to secure elimination of cer
tain Americana from the "black Hat "
The statement was officially described
here as not related to or the results of
fJf. ^taHatory It relates to
individual negotiations.
New York Car Strike, 'How
ever, Cuts Down Sur
face Line Service.
UNION OFFICIALS CLAIM
9,000 MEN WALKED OUT
Several Minor Disturbances, and
Stoning of Cars?4,000 Police
Are on Duty.
NEW YORK, September 7.?
A strike was inaugurated on the
subway and elevated lines and
several surface systems of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Com
pany today. Up to noon the city
appeared only slightly affected.
Union leaders, who demand
abrogation by the company of the
so-called "master and servant''
contracts binding the employes
not to ask wage increases for two
years, claimed that 9,000 men had
walked out, including 4,000 on the
subway and elevated systems.
Traction officials asserted not
more than 2,000 men had quit, and
that, with the aid of strikebreak
ers, the company was maintain
ing normal schedules on subway
and "L."
Few Surface Cars Bun.
The "green car" system, operated by
the New York Railways Company, was
chiefly affected. Apparently not more
than 30 per cent of these surface cars
are running. Except in Manhattan and
the Bronx borough no lines were af
fected.
The New York Railways Company an
nounced that its recent agreements
with its employes were abrogated, ef
fective today, and that the work had
been begun of signing individual con
tracts. The Interborough announced
that its men who did not strike will re
ceive double pay until further notice.
Little Disorder Reported.
Throughout the district affected lit
tle disorder was reported. In Harlem
and on the East Side there were a few
minor disturbances. About 4,000 patrol
men. in uniform and plain clothes, were
on duty to guard property and protect
passengers on cars and at stations.
Several instances of elevated trains
being bombarded with stones and bot
tles, thrown from roofs, were reported
to the police shortly before 9 o'clock
Reserves, rushed to the scenes of dis
order, entered the buildings and chased
from the roofs gangs of men said to
have been seen carrying missiles.
Meanwhile traction officials, admit
ting that "the gravity of the situation
is such that at any moment a crisis
may arise," were providing stocks of
provisions for strike breakers, many of
whom have come from other cities.
Strike Menace Great.
if the carmen can carry out their
threats to halt surface as well as sub
way and elevated traffic. New York
faces the biggest and most vital strike
In Its history. The geographical for
mation of Manhattan Island?long and
narrow?the wide distribution of pop
ulation of the^greater citv and the
concentration of the business make
.New York peculiarly susceptible to any
interruption of street car traffic
When the workers of the city started
for their places of employment today
the Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway Employes con
ducting the strike, had been unable to
tie up the subway and elevated lines
but had succeeded in crippling some of
the most important surfdce lines.
Traffic Nearly Normal.
With the aid of nearly 3,000 strike
breakers and under police protection,
the Interborough Rapid Transit Com
pany was running Its trains on subway
and "L" almost on normal schedules.
At 9 o'clock the Interborough reported
that express and local trains were
running on normal schedule on both
subway and elevated lines, ?nd with
but few changes from the regular
crews.
The strike of the Interborough em
ployes has spread, however, to the car
men of the New York Railways Com
pany, which operates all but two of
the important surface lines In the bor
ough of Manhattan and the Bronx
Lines In Brooklyn In the system of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company are
thtiu f'i r 1 ? t.i.o /.a
Cause of Strike.
Approximately 18,000 employes are
affected. The immediate cause of the
i Htrike is the refusal of the Interbor
I ough company to release the men from
; an agreement to seek no further im
provement in working conditions for a
period of two years after the advance
in pay which the men received last
month. Behind these demands, how
ever, is a contest over the unionization
of the street car workers of the city,
among whom the Amalgamated Asso
ciation has gained a strong footing
only during the last few months.
The union employes of the Interbor
ough company voted to strike at 9:30
o'clock last night. Several thousand
union men Immediately scattered
through the city to win over all street
car employes to their cause. Little ef
fect from the strike was noticeable
during the night.
One elevated train was pelted with
brick bats. Passengers were taken off
and the train sent back empty to the
terminal with a few broken windows.
Guards and Choppers Quit.
About midnight several hundred men,
many of whom wore the union button,
crowded into the subway at the Grand
Central railway station and induced all
the ticket choppers and platform guards
to leave their jobs. The company
quickly filled their places.
In response, to the railway company's
appeal for protection, Ave thousand po
licemen were released from patrol duty
today and made available for strike
duty. Two or three patrolmen were
placed on guard at every subway and I
elevated station and two rode on every
opening
of SCHOOL
Postponed
to
train. For the protection of motormen
heavy wire screens were nailed to the
exposed sides of the car vestibules.
The traction chiefs declared that they
could maintain service on the subway
and elevated lines, but expressed fear
that police protection *would not be
adequate to enable them to keep the
regular number of surface cars run
ning. As a precaution all the cars on
the 23d street cross-tov^n line were
sent to the barns at midnight, but were
sent out again under police guard at
6 o'clock this morning.
Public Service Investigation.
The public service commission has
started a general Investigation of the
strike, and subpoenaed the president
and general manager of the Inter
borough company and officers of the
employes' unions to appear before the
commission this morning.
Oscar S. Straus, chairman of the com
mission, at a conference yesterda^ with
representatives of the union requested
that the strike call be held up pending
another attempt by himself and Mayor
Mitchel to settle the trouble. The labor
leaders declined.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company,
declared that with adequate police pro
tection the company could cope success
fully with the situation and "guaran
tee transportation to the public." He said
that only a small number of the com
pany's employes had become unionized.
Mr. Shonts issued a statement declaring
the company would "fight the union to a
finish."
"Green Car" Men Out.
Employes on the "Green car" line of the
New York Railways Company also voted
last night to strike. This is one of the
most important of the city's surface car
lines. The men acted through sympathy
for the subway and elevated railway em
ployes.
The first effect of the strike in the
subway apparently was felt shortly after
midnight, when strikebreakers took the
places of guards on several trains. The
company announced, however, that the
regular motormen were remaining at
work. While officials of the Interborough
admitted that a large number of guards
had quit, they declared schedules would
be maintained by filling the places with
strikebreakers.
Union leaders declare many workers
were discharged yesterday because they
refused to take off their union badges.
Interborough car barns gave the ap
pearance of barracks. Approximately
4,000 men have been housed and fed in
preparation for the anticipated strike
order. Most of the men were hired by
strikebreaking agencies at the time of
the railroad emergency and were taken
over by the Interborough.

LONDON, September 7.?The
capture of German first-line
trenches over a front of one mile
before Verdun was announced to
day by the French war office.
The ground was won in the long
contested sector east of the Meuse
between the Vaux-Chapitre region
and the town of Chenois. It is
in this sector, where the Germans
most nearly approached a definite
breach in the defenses of the city,
that the heaviest fighting has
been in progress recently.
On the Somme front the princi
pal activity of last night was on
the initiative of the Germans,
who made a determined effort tc
capture from the British the small
section of ground along the
Guillefnont - Combles highway
known as Leuze wood.
The German counter attack led
to one of the fierce man-to-man
struggles with hand grenades and
bayonets which have character
ized recent fighting along the
Somme. London reports ofricially
that in the end the Germans were
beaten back.
Germans Suffer Heavy Losses.
The French statement adds that a
powerful effort made by German troops
to dislodge the French from Hospital
farm, on the Somme front, was with
out success and that the Germans were
dispersed with heavy losses.
French gains were reported in the of
ficial statement issued by the war office
last night, these being entirely south of
the Somme, where the greater part of
the village of Berny was captured, as
well as the northern portion of Ver
mandovillers.
The fighting at Ginchy continues.
There was considerable artillery ac
tivity on both sides during the night
and this morning, the Germans using
gas and lachrymatory shells. East of
Neuville St. Vaast the Germans ex
ploded a mine. Yesterday evening the
[ British carried out a very effective
I bombardment of the enemy's trenches
west of Lens.
French Official Report.
The French official statement of to
day says:
"North of the Somme the Germans
made a powerful effort to dislodge us
from Hospital farm. Their attacks
were swept by our machine guns and
dispersed with heavy losses. The enemy
did not renew his attempts during the
night. In other sectors there was noth
ing to report.
"South of the Somme the Germans de
bouched in force from the village of
Horgny, and made several attacks against
our new positions southwest of Belloy-en
Santerre, and south of Barleux. All these
attacks were stopped by our curtains of
fire before they were able to approach
our lines. The losses which the enemy
suffered during these fruitless attacks
appear to have been very great. Four
hundred prisoners taken south of the
Somme yesterday have been counted up to
now.
Saxon Division Beaten.
"According to fresh information, the Ger
man troops beaten back yesterday by our
infantry in the region east of Chilly be^
longed to a Saxon division which was
transferred hurriedly from the Aisne
front.
"On the right bank of the Meuse (Ver
dun front) toward the end erf the day
yesterday, after violent artilery prepara
tion, our troops attacked the German or
ganizations on the front between Vaux
Chapitre wood and Chenois. The entire
front line of enemy trenches fell into our
hands on a length of about 1,500 meters.
We took about 250 prisoners and about
ten machine guns.
"There is 110 event of importance to
report from the remainder of the front."
French Gains of Yesterday.
The French statement, in describing
the most striking gains of yesterday,
says:
"South of the Somme, in the after
noon, we successfully renewed our of
fensive and carrie<L?several German
trenches southeast of Belloy-en-S^p
terre.
"In a vigorous infantry attack we
carried the greater part of the village
of Berny-en-Santerre and advanced as
far as the southern projection of the
park. Between Vermandovillers and
Chilly there was especially stubborn
fighting. We carried the northern por
tion of Vermandovillers as far as the
road to Estrees.
"Farther south, in the region between
Chaulnes and Chilly, we captured more
trenches and pushed our first line to the
outskirts of Chaulnes and along the
railway between Chaulnes and Roye.
