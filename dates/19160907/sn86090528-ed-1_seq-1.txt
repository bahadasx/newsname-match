IN WELL
Isaac Hchn, Prominent Stock Raiser and
President ofjCounty Fair, Meets
Tragic Death
YOUNG MAN GOES
TO RESCUE AND DIES
Vo Tye, Nephew of Dr. Tye, of Chicka
sha, Faints While Attempting to Raise
Prospective Employer
"In the midst of life we ate in
death, was never more strikingly ex
emplified than in the tragic occurrence
In which at 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Isaac Hehn, a prosperous live
stock raiser of Pocasset and president
of the Grady County Fair association
and Vo Tye, the 18-year-old nephew
of pr. Tye of Chickasha, who was here
on a short visit to relatives, lost their
lives.
News of the death of Mr. Helm came
as, a shock to relatives and numerous
friends here immediately succeeding
the sad event and It was not until la
ter la the evening that the identity of
his companion was learned as the
presence of young Tye at the farm
was somewhat accidental.
Tye had been in Chickasha a week,
coming from his home in Paducaa
near Quanah, where his father, J. T.
Tye, Is a prosperous farmer.
Mr. Hehn drove into Chickasha yes
terday afternoon and iu conversation
with O. C. Cooper of the Farm Bureau
said he was about to clean out a well
on his farm two miles from Pocasset,
and wanted help. Cooper had talked
with Tye and it was agreed that the
vi.sitor should accompany hlru aud that
If conditions were favorable Tye would
take a place on the farm,-which is fa
mous for its fine hogs. Accompanied
by an employe named Dawson the well
waa reached, the work of emptying it
was begun about 4 o'clock. The wa
ter line had been lowered somewhat
when Mr. Hehn, who had been doing
the underground work, went to the
top to rest and mentioned the pres
ence of gas to the young men who had
been raising the water. He was again
lowered and shortily.after reaching the
bottom a sudden stillness told the men
at the top that something was wrong.
Young Tye, who stood six feet two,
weighed 100 pounds and had never
known a day's illness, told his com
panion! that if he would lift him out
when he signalled he would descend
to the rescue of his employer.
Tye Fainted.
Immediately upon being lowered Tye
lifted Mr. Hehn, who was in a foot and
a half of water, hoping to elevate him
to a point where he could be reached
by Dawson who stood about less than
twelve feet above. Tye had tied the
rope to hi9 own arm and had signalled
Dawson to raise him when the rope
slipped and both men were precipi
tated into the water, Tye fainting from
the effects of the gas.
Aid Summoned.
ppalizlne his helplessness and the
futility of attempting to rescue the
men single handed Dawson rushed to
the farm house and called on central
to send a doctor and men to aid in the
rescue work. Within thirty minutes
Dr. Brown and five or six men were
on the ground and in a short time both
men. from whom life had apparently
fled, were lifted to the surface. Harp
was summoned from Chickaana and
Drs. Livermore, Cook, Morris and
Leeds responded, someone taking a
pulmotor from the fire station here
with which the resuscitation of the
men was attempted for over two hours
but without avail. The odor of gas
was still strong at the well.
Remain Brought Here.
The remains were taken to Pocasset
from which place those of young Tye
wore brought into Chickasha and left
at the undertaking parlors of Claycomb
end Anderson at 8:30 o'clock by T. F.
Majors and Jack Kilgore. Au hour
later the remains of Mr. Hehn arrived.
They were first taken to the Baze san
itarium and later to the undertaking
arlors.
t Tye' Parent Arrive.
Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Tye, their oldset

remains of their son reposo in a cas
ket. They will accompany the remains
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning on the
Frisco to Paducah for burial. Vo had
been working with his father until a
week ago when he came to visit in
Chickasha. He waa the second eldest
child of a family of ton children, whom
neither death nor accident had eve
visited until his own. unfortunate de
mlse.
Hehn Prominent Here.
Mr. Hehn was well and favorabl
known throughout Grady county,
where he has resided for the past nine
years, coming irora nis nome in nan
sas ' where ho was born in Marion
county twenty-six years ago. His un
ion with Miss Willie Alice Baze,
daughter of Dr. R. J. Baze, was one of
the big social events of two years ago,
After residing in Chickasha for a yea
Mr. and Mrs. Hehn moved to the farm
two miles from Pocassot last January
At the time of the tragedy, however,
Mrs. Hehn was the guest of her pa
rents in Chickasha. Dr. Baze hud
spent yesterday in Oklahoma City and
on his return trip was advised of the
death of his son-in-law and left the

prominent farmer of that Bection who

years.

will vote for Woodrow Wilson in No

the man."
Mr. Vaughan says the Alex fair,

of a raid. How long this trick ha

tims could not expose it without ev
posing' themaolves to punishment for

It was during the raid on the horn
of Clem Johnson at 3 o'clock this
morning that Deputy Marshal Dilloti
ran across a peculiarly constructed c.
der barrel, the head of which had been
caved in and otherwise rendered unfit
for service. On the exposed Inner suf
fece of the head a large rubber gasket
was held In place by a zinc covering
firmly fixed by , large screws which
prevented leakage from a miniature
to.p hole. Attached to the head and
leading Into the tap hole was an inch
zinc pipe closed at the other end. The

" Russ Bombard City.
By United Press.
Petrograd, Sept. 7. Ruffian artil
lery is bombarding Halitz and the city
in reported to be afire,
Kuunett Rucker, the fifteen-year-old
son of Undersheriff Rucker, who spout
tho day here yesterday with his father,
has the making of a star of the prize
ring if ho were permitted to develop
such qualifications.
During the carnival at 'Minco la 'I
week a young aspirant for pugilistic
honors blew Into the little Grady coun
ty city from the state capital carry
ing in his swagger a challenge to all
boys and a warning to keep off. Ho
announced that they could find a chan
pion to defend the honor of their own
town It they sought diligently enough,
made up an $S purse and offered it to
the Minco boy who would meet the
outsider. Young Rucker accepted.
When he got through with the stran
per the Oklahoma City lad was in such
a pitiable condition that Emmott'3
heart molted and he divided the purse
with his vanquished foe.
A few weeks ago a twenty-three-
year-old boy shied a brick-bat at Km
mett, who immediately proceeded to
wallop his assailant to the end that
Kmmett was arrested for assault. The
Judge required no time for delibera
tion but immediately exonerated the
young defender on the evidence.
Emnvett was naturally elated over
his $4 end of the purse on his arrival
here yesterday and proudly related the
details of the affair to his father. The
county officer, however, offered him
scant hope of a fighting career. "Yoa
will have to get into the ring with the
old man if I hear of any more of this
foolishness," he said, which served to
put a dumper on the youth's aspira
tions and Emmett will now look to his
studies for glory rather than to th?
padded 6IoV(?i
in the presence of the housekeeper.
Mrs. Jones, Tho wemun then told the
story which Johnson refused to dis
cuss. A man, whose identity is at
present unknown, accosted Johnson
and told him a hard luck tale of flee
ing from federal persecution and of
fering to sell him a fifty gallon cask
ot fine whiskey for $G0. A sample was
poured out of the cask and it was es
timated that the goods were worth
from $120 to 18Q wholesale and would
retail at $ 8 a gallon, thus giving John
son a large profit. The cask was tak
en home and Johnson is said to hav a
proceeded to bottle his "find.',:, 'After
loss than a quart had been extracted
from tiie barrel, the booze would no;
longer flow. Investigation proved thnt
the contents of the sealed tube con
stituted all the whiskey which tha
cajk contained, the remainder being
water which could not pass the gas
ket. Tho federal officers have seen many;
devices for swindling but this was a
perfectly new stunt.
The most distressing part of tha
transaction was that Johnson, who
runs a little restaurant on Second
and Kansas avenue, was eager to take
advantage ot the "cinch" and not hav
ing tho required SGO borrowed thn
larger part of it from his housekeeper.
The raid was the result of many
hours' vigil. Deputy Dillon had watt
ed long after midnight on several oc
casions for Johnson to come from his
restaurant to his home, to which tho
officer had previously traced a barTel
of cider and had suspected the owner
of bootlegging. The expected hap
poned at 3 o'clock when lights appear
ed at the deserted home where it wa
believed the thirsty ones would repair
for the tabooed stuff. C-ury a singlo
quart was found, however, and on thU
Jf 'i.won was jailed and a warrant was
issued by Judge Hamilton this inorn
hig for Introducing Intoxicating liquor
into the eastern district of Oklahoma,
formerly the Indian Territory.
Officers Lee Tuck and Burrell Day
assisted In making the raid.
