Editor St. Johns Herald,
Dear Sirr
I understand that there
is being circulated a report that
I have approached Andrew Max
well and tried to get him to pull
down in. the race for the nomina
tion for sheriff of Apache County
and that if he would do so I
would make him my deputy.
I wish to say this, is a base
falsehood, as there has never been
a word passed between Mr. Max
well and J in regards to him pull
ing down and me making him my
deputy. There are no strings on
me from any source, and if elect
ed I will do my duty regardless
of friend or foe.
