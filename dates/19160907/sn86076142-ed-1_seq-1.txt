Senators Curtis, of Kansas, Repub

Senator Curtis argued that such a

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 7. The
California Railroad commission fixed
a valuation of $6,328,000 on the elec
tric distributing system of the South
ern California Edison company in Los
Angeles in connection with its in
tended purchase by -the -city of Lob
Angeles. The company contended the
property plus severance damages was
worth $21,890,066, while the munici
pality set a value of $3,473,803.
The decision is the first of Its kind
rendered In the United State by a
public service commission and sets a
precedent In regard to the fixation of
severance damages that Is, the dam
ages suffered to the remainder of the
system by an excision of the Los
Angeles portion.
The opinion fixed the actual value
of the system at $4,750,000, allowing
iu addition severance damages of
$1,578,000. .
The decision stated that reproduc
tion costs rather than the capitaliza
tion of earnings was the basis taken,
and that the commission worked with
a clear understanding of the neces
sity of an award which, by its fair
ness, would encourage further in
vestments of capital in the state.

ATLANTIC CITY, Sept 7. The
National American Woman Suffrage
association by an overwhelming vote
decided to continue Its present policy
of working for equal rights through
both national and state legislation.
The vote was taken after a long
debate and no sooner had the ap
plause that greeted the announcement
of the action taken ceased than a
resolution was presented which
threatens to . again open the whole
question tomorrow.
Virtually all the speakers urged
continuance of the non-partisan ef
forts of the association to bring about
equal suffrage.
The question of continuing the
present policy of the association came
before the convention In the form of
two proposed amendments to the or
ganization's constitution. One pro
posed that the association drop work
on state legislation and concentrate
on the proposed amendment to the
federal constitution. The other pro
vided that the association cease its
efforts In behalf of the federal amend
ment and confine its activities to
getting woman suffrage by states.
The amendments were defeated by a
viva voce vote in which few affrma-
j tlve voices were beard. Then Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the
association, presented the following
resolution:
"That the 48th annual convention
of the association interpret article
two of the constitution which pledges
our auxiliary constitution to secure
the vote for women by national and
Btate action as meaning that the
federal amendment is, our immediate
and principal aim."
The resolution stirred up opposi
tion among delegates and there waa
every evidence of a stormy session,
when further debate was shut oft by
the carrying of a motion by Miss
H. J. Patterson, of Pittsburg, that
the resolution be made a special
order of business.
The association changed the con
stitution to bar from membership all
organizations not in harmony with
the policy and constitution of the
association.
