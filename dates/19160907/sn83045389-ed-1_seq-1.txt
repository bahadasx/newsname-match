Atmouiu emem of this plan for the

made last night by Governor Stuart in
behalf of the committee in charge of
t h ?? placing of the memorial on the
Gettysburg battle field. The plan has
the approval r>f the Gettysburg Park
Commission. which has selected as the
site the spot from which General I.ee
watched Pickett's famous charge.
The decision to hold the unveiling

"Next May, however. Confederate
veterans from all over the country will

hope to be able to bring a large body

As a Confederate occasion, the un
j veiling of the monument of General J.ee
' will take first rank. The reunion .at
Washington will add to the event by
{bringing to the ceremony thousands of
I representative Confederates from all
Jover the South. The occasion will re
| call to many of them the annual re
1 union of 1S90 in Richmond, at which
i time there was unveiled in this
? city Mercler's noble statue of l.ee
j that stand# at Monument and Allen
? Avenues.
Funds for the raising of a monument
'.to l.ee on the Gettysburg field were
provided by the General Assembly. It
; was at first intended to unveil the me
morial at the semicentennial that was
celebrated bv the Rluc and the Gray
at Gettysburg in J01*>. The sculptor,
| V. William Sievers, of South Richmond,
encountered difficulties in producing a
J statue that answered his own concep
tion of what an equestrian figure of
' l.ee should be, and it was not until long
! after the semicentennial that the fin
ished figure was forwarded to the Tif
| fany studios on Long Island to lie cast
J Into bronze. The base has been fln
| ished and in place for some time, hut
! the figure of the mounted bee has not
? yet come from the* molding plant.
The delivery of the unfinished por
tion of the monument, however, is
promised in the next few wfeks, and
the completed memorial will lie In place
long before the unveiling date, some
lime next May.

charged with tlie placing of the monu

"This morning .. session laa'.ed tbvee
hours, from 1 ?> .?< 1. during which Mr.
Cabrera presided. The first nia'.tc-i' of
importance was P ? presenting of
mutual credentials. In accordance with
the Mexican form of opening confer
ence?. Mr. Cabrera made a declaration
of the purpose of the Mexican members
oi the commission, saving it was their
duty to fulfill In every way possible the
great responsibility cast upon them by
First Chief Carran/.a. and that they all
stood committed to civing their full
powers to bringing to a conclusion this
conference in such a manner as would
be most profitable to Mexico and the
United States. After that Mr. Cabrera
stated that it was the desire of the
Mexican members of the commission
that the fullest information should be
given to the commission regarding all
matters Involved, and that they were
quite read;, to meet the Americans in a
spirit of utmost frankness.
?"The members ?>f the commission then
exchanged views In general about the
situation in Mexico. and especially on
the border, with the view to making a
preparatory study of the subject. Pur
ing the conference t!ie commissioners
reviewed the growth. control ami
strength of tiie constitutional govern
ment. which has become every day
stronger during; the last two years, and
in particular since the recognition of
the constitutional de facto government,
t showing: that order was being estab
lished throughout the republic, railroad
set vice being extended, etc."
The six commissioners and two sec
retaries attended tin conference.

Secretary l.ane was host to the
party in the afternoon aboard the
presidential yacht Mayflower. As the
yacht dropped anchor on her return
the first opportunity was given f?.r
fuII naval honors to bo paid the com
missioners. The Mexican flau was
hoisted at the foremast, officers in full
dress stood at attention at the pang
way as the party left the ship. A
minute later a nineteen-gun salute
boomed.
While tlie subject of the withdraw
al of the American troops from Mexico
and related matters, such as the form
ulation of a protocol in cover future
? military operations along the border
will be disposed of tirst. it appears
certain that assurances by the < ar

place in the eves of the American com
missioners

tors .Martin and Swanson. of Virginia,
!speaking for the dark tobacco inter
ests of Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky
and Tennessee, to-day called upon
! Secretary of State l.ansing to request
r< presentations to Cermany for a
withdrawal of the Cerman ban against
American tobacco,
Mr I .a using, who has vigorously
negotiated with Creat Britain for the
privilege of sending American tobacco
to Cermany and Austria, stated that
lie would now do what lie could to
chanue the Cerman mind on the ques
tion, I'nl-ss Cerinany rescinds her
order against tohacco, the negotiations
with Hr.iit Mritain will have no point,
and will doubtless be dropped.
The Cerman order against tobacco
importations from the I'nited States
came as h distinct shock to American
interesis. This order was issued only
a few days ago, and at a time when
the threat of American reprisals
against (ir?at Mritain for barring this
product from Cermany was being
embodied in the revenue bill. it had
been assumed in the British negotia
tions that Cermany was anxious to
buy American tobacco.
Cillers Cermany, therefore, changes
her pidicy and again enters the Ameri
can tobacco market, it will lie useless
for th. I'nited States to apply further
pressure to lireat Mritain in the mat
ter. These were the phases of the
situation discussed at the State lie
part ment conference to-day.
