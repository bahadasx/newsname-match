MALTA SCHOOL OPENS
With an enrollment of 233 in the
grades and high school the local
schools opened last Tuesday, with
the enrollment divided as follows:
First grade-Miss Hulda Thomp
son, teacher, 44.
Second and third grades-Miss
Alice Coughlin, teacher, 42.
Third A and fourth grades-Miss
Dorothy Ayer, teacher, 42.
Fifth and sixth grades-Miss
Mary O'Keefe, teacher, 41.
Seventh and eighth grades-Miss
Hazel Tormey, teacher, 43.
High school-Miss Helen Cain,
Miss Helen Baum and Mr. Elliott,,1
teacher, 21.
The small enrollment in the high
school is partially due to the fact
that some of the high school pupils
are detained on account of work on
the ranches. New pupils are enroll
ing every day, four having been ad
ded on the second day of school)
making the high school enrollment
25.
As was predicted the high school
faculty Is better able to handle the,
situation than heretofore. The
high school work is going to be ofa
better quality, owing to better pre
pared teachers and less crowded
schedules. Every day the boy or
girl misses will be detrimental to'
both pupil and school, so an effort
should be made to have those who
are not already in attendance, enroll
as soon as possible. Furthermore, a
large number of very late entries"
might be detrimental to the high
school standing.
New pupils in the high school)
are:
Ninth grade, l~eota McCrea, Guy,
Rader, Carl Veseth, Muriel Edwards
Marguerite Gagen, Etta Stearns and
Mabel Lodmell.
Tenth grade, Nora Hockett,
Eleventh grade, Virginia Gagen.
Twelfth grade, Pearl Henry and
Elizaheth Kern.
Burner Survant of the class ofI
191.6, leaves soon to enter the colle
giate department of Shattuck Mill-,
tary Academy. We are advised that
Robert Conurn will accompany hin'.
Anna Survant, also of the class of
'16, leaves soon for college work in
school near Washington, D. C.
In the constructive work of huild
ing a good school one of the hest
aids is the parent Teachers' asso
elation, a variety of which we main
tamned for a time' a couple of vearsm
ago, but which was neglected las~t
year. An effort to revive the organ
ization will be nmadc. All minterested
in such a step are requested to meet
at the school house on Friday fater

MRS. JA RS NELSON DEAD.
One of the saddest deaths that
has occurred within the houndries
:of the new Phillips county since its
creation was the sudden taking
away Sunday of Mrs. bars Nelson,
wivfe of Lars Nelson, a homesteader
living a few miles south of Wagner.
Pecularily sad is this case in that
the deceased leaves two motherless
little girls aged four and two years
respectively. Neighbors were very
kind and assisted in every way dur
the short sickness and death of Mrs.
Nelson but the happy home has been
broken up and while the father does
not care to part with the children
he expects a sister of his wife will
come to look after them in the
futu~re.
Mrs. Nelson2 was born in Norway
and came to Iowa In 1908 and to
Montana in the spring of 1911 when
she was married to Mr. Nelson and
has resided; on their farm ever since,
IBesides the two little tots she leaves
two sisters In Dakota, one in Mont
ana and two brothers in Duluth,
Mirin.
th nerTuckervie were held from
the Tckerundertaking parlors
of the Methodist church, afficinating
and the remains were burled in the
Malta cemetery. The sympathy of
the entire community is extented to
the bereaved family in their sore
affliction.

hEPUJBLICANS MEET.
A very enthusiastic meeting of the
republican 'committeemen was held
in the law offices of Messrs. Tressler
&* Kirton last Monday, when nearly
all of tfle precincts were represent
ed. Mr. Tressler was elected to the
positlon of chairman for the coming
term and Mr. Kirton will represent
the republicans of Phillips county
at the state meeting at Helena Sat
urday.
Those present were of the opinlon
that this will be one of the grand
republican years and look for the
united support of the entire party
and a victory at the polls this fall Is
national., state and county politics.
The committee is very proud of the
entire list of candidates and there
are none hut what should receive the
solid support of the party.
Another meeting will he called af
ter the state meeting at which the
entire list of candidaes will be es
pecially invited and plans laid to car
ry off the bacon at the fall election.
ELECTRIC LIGHT FRANCHISE.
A party here asking fnr a fran
chise for electric lights 'for twenty
years and the same will come up
for a vote of the people in a short
time. While the Enterprise is not
favorable, as a general thing, to
giving franchises tn nd ivid ualIs or
corporat ions, it is an evidlen t fact
that1 sonmet lung should be donie to
give Malt a a lighting syst em. The
cliy bas run the plant at a bias since
leasin g it from I le 11gb t coin tany,
wb ic comCifipaniy also ran it atI a loss
for several months, and it would
have been closed down hut for the

of Malta want lights, and we luti ev'

sootheoiio a franchise, indI as we in
lest and~ it we wvo iid have twenty

that everyone should become famil
