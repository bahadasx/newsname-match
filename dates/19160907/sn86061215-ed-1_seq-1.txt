The conferees found some obstacles
which it is hoped will be smoothed out
tomorrow.
The house, meanwhile, put in its
time hearing political speeches. The
senate, having nothing else to do, took
up the Owen corrupt practices bill but
democratic leaders said it bad no
chance of passage.
Representative Mann, republican
leader, declared the senate amendment
taxing print paper above certain prices
would tend to increase the price and
drive the industry to Canada. He said,
however, that an Investigation would
doubtless show no justification for
raising the price.
The administration emergency rev
enue bill, providing for the raising of
$205,000,000 annually, the creation of a
tariff commission and other Important
economic principles, passed last night
in the senate by a vote of 42 to 16,
with five republicans voting for it.
Underwood Fights Bill.
Final consideration of the measure
in the senate last night was marked by
vain fights of Senator Underwood to
eliminate the tariff commission section
and of Senator Husting to establish
publicity of Income tax returns and
by abandonment under Senator Lafol
lette's threat to filibuster of the ad
ministration plan to include as an
amendment the Webb bill, which
would permit American exporters to
organize joint selling agencies for for
eign trade.
The bill was called up at the outset
of the session of the house on a motion
by Democratic Kitchin to send the bill
to conference.
Republican Leader Mann wanted
time to read the bill and Mr. Kitchin
temporarily withdrew the motion. With
Representatives Rainey of Illinois and
Dixon of Indiana, democratic ranking
members of the ways and means com
mittee, he went over to the senate for
an niformal conference on the bill.
Pending developments, Mr. Kitchin
withheld the concurrent resolution for
adjournment of congress.

Potter's Bar, as a point of vantage.
The men were buried in a common
grave and the German officer in a
smaller one.

on Record in Favor of
Protective Duties
MEASURE REGARDED
IMPORTANT TO MEN
Other Plans Laid to Help
Cause of Labor When
World War Ceases
Birmlnghanl, Eng., Sept. 6. —The
trades union congress, representing
nearly 2,500,000 organized workers of
Great Britain, took an important un
expected step today by adopting, with
a majority of more than 1,000,000 votes
a resolution virtually endorsing the
principle of protection.
The resolution asks for "the adop
tion of methods for restricting or pre
venting the importation of cheap man
ufactured goods produced at lower
rates of wages and under worse labor
conditions than prevail in this coun
try."
The congress considered other reso
lutions regarded as of importance for
labor after the war, Including one deal
ing with restoration of trades union
rights which have been suspended in
order to increase the output of muni
tions.
The congress went on record as in
favor of creation of a state department
for adjustment of pension claims. Na
tionalization of agriculture, shipping
industries and mines met with unani
mous approval. A fixed minimum
wage and shorter hours of labor SJBO
were advocated to avoid .unemploy
ment and distress after the war.
WOMEN DEBUTE
SUFFRAGE PLAN
Atlantic City, N. J., Sept S.—The
National American Woman Suffrage
association, which opened Its forty
eighth annual convention today, will
not, according to influential leaders,
endorse or criticize as an organization
any candidate now in the field for the
office of president of the United States
because of the views he holds on the
question of equal rights for women.
It was expected by these same lead
ers, which Include Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt, president, and Mrs. Anna
toward Shaw, former president of the
association, that the organization will
vote down all amendments commit
ting the association to work exclusive
ly for the suffrage amendment to the
federal constitution or to work for
equal suffrage through the state alone.
The association will decide to con
tinue its fight for votes for women by
working for both the federal amend
ment and state, amendments, it was
declared.
The momentous question affecting
the organisation came up at the after
noon session. Miss Laura Clay of
Kentucky favored confining the asso
ciation's activities to state legislation.
Miss Ida Husted Harper, New York,
urged the dropping of work for state
referenda and concentrate on the fed
eral amendment, while Mrs. Raymond
Brown, New York, argued that the
present policy of the association to
work for woman suffrage "by appropri
ate national and state legislation" be
continued. The vote on the question
is to be taken after the debate has
concluded.
The forenoon was confined to the
routine reports of officers. Mrs.
FranlfM. Roessing of Pittsburgh, vice
president and chairman of the con
gressional committee, warned dele*
gates not to let the cause of equal
rights suffer from overconfidence be
cause Charles E. Hughes had endors
ed the federal amendment.
She said the congressional commit
tee had not given up hope of convinc
ing President Wilson of the justice of
the federal amendment.

UFIIEITE DAY
BEING OBSERVED
IN NEWVBRKGITT
HONOR 18 PAID TO MEMORY OF
YOUTH WHO AIDED IN WAR
OF INDEPENDENCE.
New York, Sept. 6.—The tricolor of
France floats from many buildings in
New York City today while thou
sands of citizens are wearing buttons
bearing the French national emblem
in celebration of Lafayette day, com
memorating the 169th anniversary of
the birth of the distinguished French
man who came to the aid of the
American, colonies in their struggle
for independence. The occasion was
of additional significance to French
residents of the city as today also Is
the seoond anniversary of the battle
of the Marne.
The formal exercises honoring La
fayette's memory begin at 3 o'clock
this afternoon when Jules J. Jusser
and, ambassador from France to the
United States, with Mme. Jusserand
and his staff, arrive from Boston. The
visitors, together with George E. Lel
bert, French consul general, and his
staff, will be received at (the steps of
the city hall by Acting Mayor Frank
L. Dowling and a committee.
Former Judge Alton B. Parker will
preside at the exercises in the alder
manic chamber, where addresses will
be delivered by Dr. John H. Finly,
president of the university of the state
of New York Robert Bacon, former
ambassador to France, and Ambassa
dor Jusserand. There will be a ban
quet In the evening.
Lafayette was but 20 years of age
when his sympathy for the American
colonies in their war for independence
caused him to come to America in a
ship fitted out at his own expense, and
volunteer his services without pay. He
soon demonstrated his military genius
and was one of Washington's most
trusted -lieutenants. When France de
clared war against England in 1779,
Lafayette went back home and volun
teered his services to his own coun
try. There he obtained financial as
sistance for the Americans and later
he returned with a fleet and some six
thousand French soldiers, who, under
his leadership, played a big part in
the campaign which saw Cornwallis,
the British commander, driven to
Yorktown, where he Anally was com
pelled to surrender.
Lafayette played an important part
in the French revolution and material
ly aided that country in its fight for
democracy. He resigned his own
titles of nobility. He lived to a ripe
old age and before his death, made a
visit to America. He was received
here with wild enthusiasm and his
tour was one continuous fete. Con
gress voted him $200,000 and a section
of land and he was in need of it, for
hiB own fortune had suffered severely
in the French revolutions. He spent
the last years of his life engaged in
agricultural pursuits.

Regaining Consciousness,
She Gives Name and
Galesburg as Home
Promise City, Sept. 6.—(Special):
After Appanoose county authorities
had been communicated with it was
decided today to remove the young
woman, found in a farmer's yard near

Eula MoCrary and her residence as
Galesburg, 111., was found at the Len
nle Sager place, three miles east of

to the house and called a physician as
she was unconscious. She remained
in this condition for several hours. On
regaining consciousness she told that
she bad come from the Illinois city.

the fence and examination by the
physicians showed that she was se
verely bruised about her face and on
her right side.
The presence of an automobile
filled with strangers, which passed
through Promise City in the early
morning, gives rise to the theory
that the girl was thrown from
the car as It passed the 8ager home.
Tracks from an automobile are plainly
visible In the road close up to the
fence near which the girl was lying.
The young woman gives her age as 18
years.

that she fired the shots to save her
own life. Three bullets were fired into
his head.
Until making the alleged confession,
Mrs. Barnes had stoutly maintained
that her husband had ended his own
life. She previously had admitted
purchasing the revolver, but asserted
she kept it in her apartment as a pro
tection against burglars.
Barnes met his wife by appointment
in his wife's apartment last night to
try to adjust their difficulties out of
court. He had filed suit for divorce
which was to have been heard today.
