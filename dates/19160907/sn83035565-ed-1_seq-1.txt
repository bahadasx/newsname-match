The Greenville (O.) Jour
nal and Its Times.
BY ISAAC KAY, M. D.
After an interval of many years
I have recently had a pleasing
chance of seeing a copy or two
of the Greenville Journal. Dur
ing the checkered course of hi8
younger life the writer of this
article lived in Ithaca, Darke
. county, Ohio, and he has felt an
interest in that region of the
state ever since. In those early
times when I was in the habit of
seeing the Greenville Journal,
the Hon. Hiram Bell was con
gressman, from the Third Ohio
District, Mr. Taylor editor of the
Journal, and Dr. I. N. Gard, who
died in Greenville a few years
ago at the age of 94 years, was
H the veteran physician of his town
and county.
And speaking of the early
Darke county physicians reminds
me to say that the writer's per
sonal acquaintance and present
memory includes Dr. Rufus Gil--patrick
and James G. Blunt of
New Madison, but afterward of
Kansas; Dr. Thomas D. Stiles,
formerly of Carlisle, Penn., and
Dr. Curtis Otwell, both then lo
cated at fort Jefferson : as also
Drs. Robert L. VanHarlJngen and
Wm. B. Gray of Ithaca. Drs.
Otwell and Gray came from Guil-
J ford Court House, a'Quaker set-
' t1' ' ' ' "r.-r, i; th
- ,. :nli-tl.cry
; I r. Otwell being an
out and out abolitionist, as was
also Dr. Gilpatrick, who was an
able public speaker and skillful
debater.
But it is more particularly of
the Greenville Journal that 1
wish now to speak. The friend
ly face of that sterling newspa
per has been quite familiar to
the people of Dark's county for
nearly 85 years. It has never
changed its name nor evenits
letter heading to the writer's
knowledge : nor its essential po
litical status. At first, and as
long as that party existed in
American politics, the Greenville
Journal was firmly Whig In
1856, when the Republican party
took its place, the Journal as
sumed a strong and unswerving
position in the Republican party
and has continued ably battling
for its leading principles.
The Greenville Journal com
menced its long and honorable
career in the year 1832. To this
particular year we wisbto call
special attention, and make some
of its dates and features the basis
of u cast for the Journal's horo
scope. As in a more supersti
tious age it was the custom to1
cast personal nativities by care
fully and critically noting the
' appearance of the skies, and
viewing the movements of the
heavenly bodies al the hour or on
the day of each particular birth,
so in like manner we might .now
attempt briefly 'to set forth those
social and political aspects of the
world which characterized the
Greenville Journal's natal year.
Thus we shaft attempt to cast its
nativity, not by scanning the
conjunction of the planets, sun,
moon ind stars, but by peering
into the significance of contem
porary historic facts and events,
That is. by human history and
not by astronomy.
The Greenville Journal com
menced its long and honorable
career with the year 1832, as I
have said. By way of opening
up our theme we shall attempt a
partial reproduction of the times
and characteristic features per
taining to the aforesaid year; a
task which may be accomplished,
to a slight extent at least, by
portraying in shadowy outline its
prominent historic events.
During the year 1832 one of
the most engrossing matters was
the fearfully destructive preva
lence of the Asiatic cholera. In
the spring of 1832, Irish emi
grants brought it to Detroit by
way of Quebec. The soldiers go
ing to the Black Hawk war con
tracted tha disease ahd spread it
through many of the western
forts. Finally the epidemic reach
ed New Orkans, where 6,000
died out of a population of 55,000.
The worst of its subsequent visi
tations were in the years 1848
and 1865. The malady proved
fatal to many of the most dis
tinguished persons in our nation.
In the" early part of the year
1832 some of the more unenlight-
eii'vi and mdre superstitions Laa
scarcely "gotten over their scare
from t h e phenomenal falling
star of November, 1831. In
1832 culminated, in all its vio
lence, the South Carolina - doc
trine and nullification. The great
political leaders of the South had
for years been sowing the seeds
of hatred for federal authority
and the constitution. It was
then that President Andrew Jack
son had occasion, to cast that
frightful bombshell into the camp
of the conspirators which will
forever be a theme for commen
dation by the American patriot
and historian. Old Hickory Jack
son, as he was called, arose in all
his majesty and declared that
the "FEDERAL UNION MUST
BE PRESERVED." The slogan
of Calhoun and his friends was
that "LIBERTY SHOULD BE
PREFERRED TO UNION." But
history has recorded the result
of this contest.
In 1832 Andrew Jackson was
re-elected for his second term as
president of the United States,
and Martin VanBuren as vice
president, after having served as
secretary of state during Jack
son's first term.
In 1832 Dom Pedro of Portugal
was enabled, chiefly by means of
a loan from the English, to raise
a fleet and make a landing at a
northern Portugese port in de
fense of Donna Maria da Gloria's
claim to the queenship of Portu
gal. .
Immediately before this a per
iod of indescribable confusion
and misrule had existed. The
nobles, monks and rabble ruled
that country; 10,000 Portugese
citizens went into exile. When,
in 1832, Dom Pedro had made
the abovj named preparedness,
Admiral Napier operated on the
coast of Algarve, in the southern
province of Portugal, successful
ly in favor of the young queen,
whose cause, by this means, be
came victorious.
But we will now close this hor
oscope view of the world as its
affairs stood in the Greenville
Journal's natal year with the
general reflection that when we
are disposed to take a serious
and correct view of the subject,
Time will appear as a restless,
rapid and ever widening stream,
proceeding, as it were, from un
der the very Throne of God; for
Time and Stream resemble each
other in the
"Silent pace with which they steal
away;
No wealth can bribe, no prayera per
suade to stay;
Both are alike, irrevocable when past,
And a wide ocean swallows both at
last.
Though each resembles each in part
A difference strikes at length the mus
ing heart
Where streams abound they never
flow in vain,
They bless the land with fruit, with
plenty strew the plain.
But Time that should enrich the no
bler mind,
Neglected, leaves a dreary waste be-
nind."

John H. Gilbert was born Feb
ruary 6,' 1S3J, end departed this
life August 21, 1916, aged 58
years, 6 months and 15 days. He
was united in marriage to Lou-
vena Haworth on May 28, 1881.
To this union four children were
b,orn Elva Maud, now Mrs. Lin-
der; Chloey Ethel Dull, Clay Har
rison and Ray Delvas. Chloey
preceded her father in death op
June 18. 1907. Those remaining
to mourn the death of this loving
husband and father are his be
loved wife, three children, one
sister, seven grandchildren and
a host of relatives and friends.
Mr. Gilbert spent his entire
life on the old home farm, where
he resided at the time of his
death, except eight years, and
lived an exemplary life among
the friends and neighbors of the
Beech community.
The name of Johnny Gilbert
always brought to our minds the
sympathetic heart and ever ready
hand to help any one, in neecj.
He was among the first members
to unite with the Christian church
at this place after its erection,
always supporting- and helping
the church as a faithful member.
Keeping the faith as we have,
the consolation is ours that he is
not lost, only gone before. He
was very patient and ready to go.
The family wish to thank the
neighbors and friends for their
kindness and help during their
bereavement. We also wish to
thank the Sunday school class
for their beautiful flowers.

This is Labor.Day, but with
what purpose or interest it was
so ordained does not appear if
judged by the manner in which
it is celebrated. According to
the manner of some it is a day of
orgies, but of this manner there
is and ought to be but few. Up
on the whole, its observance is
inapiopermanner. Labor ought
to confer ilignitjlipon mankind
and make every person more
dignified and self-respecting. It
ought to inspire us with the de
sire to be sincere, diligent in
business, temperate in life and
unselfish in our conduct and
treatment of : our fellows. In
this way Labor Day may be made
a benefit and real uplift
Our village schools begin next
Monday, when the kids and the
larger fellows will gather their
books and school equipment and
hie to the schoolroom and there
try to inaster the ordinary science
of life and fit themselves for ser
vice for their fellows. May the
young idea learn to shoot in the
right direction and lecrn to emu
late the life of the good and great
of earth.

Labor Day and the railroad

proposed. Legislation, it seems,
averted the expected action, but
what the provisions of that en

the order is bein& reversed and
now we are casting out the dead

that is astounding and arouses
horror in the minds of righteous

OHIO PROUD OF
GREATEST FAIR
Willis Administration "Delivers
the Goods" Great Credit
Doe to Careful Officials.
State Board ef Agriculture Under
stands Wishes of the People and
Meet Them Also Makes Big Sav
ing fh Managing Agricultural Affairs
of the State.
The greatest state fair in the his
tory of the Buckeye state wa3 giveu
the people of Ohio last week by tae
Willis administration.
In point of attendance, the fair of
1916 exceeded even the largest hopes
of its promoters. The total was over
50,000 a day a total for the fair over
0,000 in exves of any previous state
fair in Ohio.
In number of Kvo stock exhibits
alone, this year's fair exceeded by 118
carloads any of its predecessors.
In the courtesy of its management
and the qua'Hy of the service given
those in atttr.da.nce, the parallel is
even more striking- "One of the
greatest thing3 about the great state
fair that is c!oslna; today is the new
spirit of courtesy that has been in
stilled into It by the new manage
ment," said the Columbus Citizen Fri
day. In the quality of its attractions, it
gave to the patrons of Ohio's great
fairs such merit as has never before
been seen on the state fair grounds.
"The Ohio fair thi3 year ir second
only to Toronto's world-wide famed
exhibits," said Duncan Marshall, min
ister of agriculture, of Alberta, Can
ada. Taking it all in all, never was there
such a state fair in Ohio. Everybody
is enthusiastic about it and prouder
than ever of the great state which it
represented. T. D. Harmon of the Na
tional Stockman reflects the general
sentiment when he said Friday: "I
have been attending Ohio state fairs
ever since 1882 for the purpose of wilt
ing them up. Unquestionably the fair
this year Is the largest and best of
them all." The same sentiment was
echoed by John Cunningham of the
Ohio Farmer. . i
JP-I!V Fleming, assistant manager of
the International Live Stock Show at
Chicago, said on Wednesday: "If we
can have as good a draft horse show
of Percherons and Belgians at Chi
cago as here this year, we will be
greatly pleased."
The credit for this state fair the
greatest in the history of Ohio is due
to the work of the state board of agri
culture, a beard of ten practical farm
ers, which replaced the Cox high-sal
arled board of theorists. The ten mem
bers of this board, appointed by Gov
ernor Willis, reach every section of
the rural and manufacturing interests
of Ohio, and are in close touch with
the pulse of the people, as no central
ized board of theorists can be. Never
was there a better demonstration of
the ability of such a board to ascer
tain the wishes of Onio people and
meet them than the fair last week.
Toithe members of the board, their
secretary, George StaufTeij of Ottawa,
and the fair manager. W. H. Kinnan
of Cleveland, great credit is due.
An interesting fact connected with
the fair is that the largest attendance
came on "Governor's Day." Governor
Willis was present, mingling among
the people of Ohio and enjoying the
splendid representation of their work.
The greeting accorded him was one of
the mof-t notable in the history of any
Ohio fair. And yet. as under former
administrations, there was no large
expenditure of the people's money, ad
vancing political considerations. Many
careful observers noted this splendid
turnout on "Governor's Day," remark
ing that it would nave been a remark
able attendance had a president
of the United States been present,
and that it evidences the popularity
of Ohio's present governor.
There were no passes this year,
save to the old. veterans and the sol
diers at the Columbus Barracks and
Camp Willis. Judges were selected
because of their ability along especiai
lines not because, as in former ad
ministrations, a governor wished to
reward political friends. There was
no flashing of political pictures upon
the screen for effect in the forthcom
ing election. The only interests con
sidered were those of an exhibit repre
senting truly the great state of Ohio.
The result is a showing to the peo
ple of Ohio of the real merit of the
Willis administration, which has
struck terror. Into the camp of the
state Democracy. Even the most rad
ical anti-Willis papers have been com
pelled to admit that, in every respect,
tha state fair this year was handled
the best in the history of Ohio. It is
a showing of which the whole state Is
proud.
Already the managers of the fair
have set their mark for a fair in 1917
with an attendance of at least 300,000.
Many new plans are already under
ronsideration.
And, incidentally, it may be of Inter
est to know that Ohio's agricultural
Interests under the Willis state board
of agriculture cost Just $83,000 for the
year ending July 1, 1916, as compared
with $118,000 for the same period un
der the centralized Cox regime.
The people of Ohio who know un
derstand that the showing of the state
fair is merely an example of the
changed conditions, relative to cost
and efficient, everywhere' in state de
partments, nder the administration
of Govern.! Willis. ;
MACK, REPUDIATED,
GETS OUT OF RAGE
Glaring Irregularity Alleged to
Petitions Filed In Cincinnati,
Disappointed Office-Seeker Will Now
Attempt to Form an Alleged
"Law Enforcement League" Move
Amuses Those On the Inside.
Columbus, Sept. 5. Following al
most immediately upon disclosures re
flecting upon the integrity of nom
inating petitions fiied in his behalf,
Rudolph A. Mack cf Cincinnati Satur
day evening withdrew as a candidate
of the alleged "Law 'Enforcement
party" for governor of Ohio. Mr.
Mack, a disappointed office-seeker, is
to continue his fight against Governor
Willis,' who refused him appointment,
by attempting to organize a so-called
"Law Enforcement league." J His at
tempts have been repudiated by the .
Anti-Saloon league and the Hamilton
County Dry Amendment league.
Concerning Mack's petitions, toe
Cinciunati Kuquirer of Sunday re
marks: "A cursory inspection seemed
to indicate many glaring irregulari
ties. The impression that the peti
tions contain names of fictitious per
sons, that signatures are not genuine,
that hundreds of names are in the
same handwriting, and that the names
of a large number of collectors, whose
affidavits accompany the petitions, are
not to be found in the city directory
or on the registration books, it is said,
was born out by the investigation of
the Republican campaign committee
yesterday."
Mr. Mack was a candidate against :
Governor Willis for the Republican
nomination for governor at the Au
gust primary. According to Columbus '
investigators, Mr. Mack and his close
friend. Matt Glaser. another disap
pointed office-seeker, held numerous
conferences during this campaign with j
Robert F. Wolfe, the 'close supporter i
of ex-Governor Cox, and certain it 13 :
that Wolfe's bitter anti-Willis news- J
papers gave Mack unprecedented '
newspaper support. The report filed I
by Mack revealed the fact that his J
"Chief financial backer In the August
campaign , was Charles IL Gerrish,
paign as the maker of an affidavit in
which, confessing himself to have
been a lobbyist, Gerrish sought to re
flect upon the legislative career of the
governor. Gerrish had been disap
pointed in not receiving party office
"ne desired in that campaign, and has
been reputed since to be the polity
leal agent of Wolfe. '
"It is extremely amusing to think
of a moral. law enforcement cam- 2
palgn backed by Bob Wolfe and
Charles Gerrish," said a Columbus
friend of the two men Sunday. "Every
body knows that the only political con
sideration of interest to thefe two
men is the re-election of ex-Governor
Cox. They hope to use the alleged
'Law Enforcement league' to catcb
the unwary."
COX COMMISSION
A C03TLY AFFAIR
Independent Report Says II
Pnnnlit Cld nHfl Tnn IIiiaIi
003.UUU IUU NlUUil
Columbus, O., Sept. 5. The report
of Ernst & Ernst, one of the best ac
counting firms in this country, to the
effect that the industrial commission,
controlled by Cox hold-over members,
should make a retrenchment of $39,
000 annually in its salary payroll, has
created no little excitement in Demo
cratic circles. Leaders of the Cox par
ty are at a loss to find an explanation
satisfactory to the people of Ohio.
When Governor Cox, in 1913, re
vamped the commission in order to
oust appointees of Governor Harmon
and make his own control of it sure, no
matter whether he was re-elected or
not, he gave as a chief reason the pos
sibilities of the combination of depart
ments and accompanying retrench
ment. But it is now shown by two in
vestigations, the second by an entire
ly independent authority, that no such
retrenchments were ever undertaken
In fact, expenditures continued to in
crease. While Governor Willis was
obtainins marked reductions in the
salary payrolls of departments under
his control, exactly an opposite policy
was actuating the still ox-controlled
industrial commission.
Chairman Yaple even stated, after
the first report, that "he saw no merit
!n it and would mash it flat." Three
of the biggest business men in the
state were then asked to conduct the
second investigation, and their report
row substantiates the first. .To break
Us force, some cf the Cox papers have
deliberately falsified their headlines to
make it appear that Governor Willis
uas uau marge vi iuc iiiuiibwi! wui
mission. As a matter of fact, the ex
travagant policy Is merely a continu
ation by Cox appointees of the ex
travagant and autocratic policies of
the former administration. Two of the
members of the Industl'al torn
mission are Cox appointees. 1
