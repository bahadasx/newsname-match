Parsons Lads Had Big Time for
Two Weeks at Kc-
union Park.
The score or more Boy Scouts
under Scout Master O' Toole from
Parsons ended their annual out
ing last week and returned home
Saturday.
All declared that they had had
the best time in all their lives
and were determined to return to
Baxter next year where they said
they were treated right royally.
Before departing; the following
letter was handed to The News
for publication:
To People of Baxter Springs
From the Boy Scouts.
On the afternoon of August 21,
1916, Boy Scout Troop' No. 3, of
Parsons, Kans., arrived in Baxter
o camp on the Old Soldiers.
Reunion grounds. We were
strangers in the town and at first
didn't know how the Baxter
people as a whole would receive
such a group of young fellows
We tried to act as manly as we
could and do the most in our
power not to violate our Scout
Law or Scout Oath. From our
two weeks' camp in Baxter
Springs, we hope the people have
obtained some idea of "Scoutrag"
and that great organization,
"The Boy Scouts of America,"
of which about 100,000 boys are
members.
Each and everyone of us have
enjoyed our two weeks camp in
Baxter and first of all we wish to
thank the City of Baxter Springs
for the use of the old cannon and
the generous reception and treat
ment of us while here.
We cannot find words enough
to express our many thanks to J.
W. Grantham for the treats and
many kindnesses he has shown
towards us.
As for Mr. King, the Stude
baker agent, each . boy expresses
his utmost appreciation of the
splendid trip to the Missouri
State Fair at Carthage on Sep
tember 1, 1916. We also thank
him for his courtesy in takiog us
from town to the camp.
The following persons are also
to be thanked: Mr. John Polster
and wife for their treat at
Grantham's the day we arrived;
Miss Stephens and the group of
other young people for the
splendid evening's entertainment
they gave us at the camp; the
Pearl Grocery for its treat, which
consisted of watermelons; Mr.
Price of Joplin for the use of the
camp grounds; Mr. Henry Cavan
aagh for many courtesies, the
Chautauqu committee and plat
form manager, Mr. Berry, for
two very splendid numbers and
lastly we thank Mr. Covey and
family for the pleasant evening's
entertainment on Thursday,
Aug. 31, 1916.
We leave Baxter for home
feeling much happier and
healthier thsn before and again
we wish to thank you one and all
for the above mentioned kind
oesses.
Signed,
Boy Scout Tkoop, No. 3.

Raid at Picher.
People coming in from Picher
report a reign of terror in that
mining camp Saturday, caused
bv the raiding of the b002e joints
and automobiles carrying liquor
into the district " from Joplin.
Deputy Sheriff Trask and three
assistants of Pic'ier and two
deputies from Miami, made the
raids and a number .of desperate
encounters took place, resulting
in the confiscation of barrels of
beer and hundreds of gallons of
liquor. One man in an auto
tried to escape and the officers
followed and shot the rear of the
car to pieces. The driver finally
surrendered snd the officers found
about forty bottles of booze in
the par. A blind pigger armed
a number of men and sent a defi
to the officers, but the shack was
raided just the same, the law!
violators deciding at the last
moment that it would be better
not to start the shooting. The
confiscated liquor and several
prisoners were taken to Miami.
Chautauqua Satisfies.
The Chautauqua, again, has
come and gone, leaving if we
judge correctly, a little better
impression than on any previous
year and looked upon perhaps by
a larger number as an institution
of actual value to the community.
The program on the whole was
of an excellent order, educational
and elevating in character. Some
numbers were particularly good
but The News has not the space
to go into a detailed review of
the performances. It is sufficient
to say that the White & Meyers
company deserveingof commenda
tion for the general high quality
of their talent and the business
like manner in which they deal
with the people. .
The News hopes to see them
here again next year, but at
present that matter is undecided.
The local promoters have not yet
secured a sufficient number of
guarantors or sold enough tickets
to justify them in signing up with
tfie company for another year.
The mark is very nearly reached,
however, and it is not unlikely
that a little later others will
come in and the contract will be
renewed.
The Chautauqua this year was
financial success. A small
balance will be left after paying
all the expenses.
New Building.
The Perkins Building & Im
provement company will build a
business block forthwith on
Military street two lots south of
the corner feed store. It will be
of brick and concrete 50x124 feet,
one story. The roof will be of
steel and cement without posts
and the entire building will be
fire proof. When completed it
will be occupied by Sam Shaefer
as a garage and warehouse for
the new All Steel car for which
be has the agency.
Elect Officers.
At a meeting of the W. C. T.
U. in the library building Tues
day the following officers were
elected: Mrs. Louisa Haines,
president ;Mrs. Sadie S. Satterlee,
vice president; Mrs. Rebecca
Kain, recording secretary; Mrs.
Jennie L. B. Brewster, corres
ponding secretary; Mrs. Julia L
Dills, treasuier. Mrs. Haines
and Mrs. Kain, delegates to the
county convention at Columbus
last Wednesday, made their re
port. Buys. Drug Store;
J. C. Page, a druggist from
Joplin, has bought out the drug
and jewelry bubiness of A. R.
Kane, in this city, and has taken
possession. Mr. Kane will retire
from business. Mr. Page for
several years was in the employ
of Wheeler & Leffon, of Joplin.
Besides being a thoroughly com
petent pharmacist, be is a live
business man who will become a
valuable addition to the rapidly
increasing list of boosters who
are going to make Baxter Springs
the best town in Southeast
Kansas. He is a son-in-law of

KILLS CHILDREN
FOR INSURANCE
Negro Chloroforms Victims
Then Tries to Burn
HouseConfesses
James Lawrence, of this city,
is under arrest and confined in
jail at Columbus, charged, on his
own confession, of having mur
dered his two small children. Sun
day night His object in com
mitting the crime was to get the
$500 insurance he had on each
life and to have the children out
of the way so that he might mar
ry a colored maiden who objected
to a man with children.
Lawrence is a widower and for
some time, since the death of his
wife, has been caring for bis
children in his little home in the
north part of the city. Sunday
night he went out to see a neigh
bor. While he was away other
neighbors discovered smoke issu
ing from the windows of the
house. They turned in the fire
alarm and when men forced their
way inside the house they found
the two children in bed. About
twenty feet away was a smoulder
ing fire sending out a dense
smoke. It is reported that the
children were dead and their
bodies were stiff when taken out
of the house. The authorities at
once became suspicious that the
fire was not an accident and on
Tuesday morning Lawrence was
taken into custody and locked up.
County Attorney F. W. Boss was
sent for and came down and gave
. . -
idc prisoner a severe examination.
Lawrence did not confess then,
but the attorney ordered that be
be held longer. During the
night when alone with Marshal
Horton he gave up and confessed.
Hortoa at once sent for Justice of
the Peace Jones and the confes
sion was taken down in writing'
Fearing violence here, the man
was taken to (Joiumbus during
the night. Jt is now recalled
that Lawrence's wife died sudden
ly about three years ago and that
he collected insurance on her life.
Auto Race Costs Life.
Glen Skelly, of Picher,
was
killed last Thursday by the over
turning of his Ford automobile
on tne roaa- between mxter
Springs and Picher. He was in
the taxi service and had three
passengers, none of whom were
seriously injured. Skelly was
pinned under the car and was
alive when rescued. As soon as
possible he was started for the
hospital at Joplin but died on the
way. Skelly at the time of the
accident it is reported was racing
with a man driving a motor
cycle. He leaves a wife and a
ten weeks old child. Automobile
drivers, or many of them on the
roads in this territory appear to
have gone speed mad. One night
last week a couple of cars collided
two miles east of town while
under high speed. The cars
were badly wrecked and some of
the occupants were injured, but
we did not learn the names. At
Joplin two or three Baxter drivers
have been arrested and fined for
speeding. It is reported that
Saturday in trying to escape from
a motor cycle policeman a Baxter
Springs man ran over the police
man and wrecked his machine.
He was arrested and heavily fined
after lying in ml over Sunday.
For the love of Mike, boys, can't
you use a little reason. Have
regard for the lives of women
and children if you don't care
anvthing about your own.

In Real Life
It seldom happens in real life that the "tail wags the
dog" or that people "get the cart before the horse."
They are merely extravagant examples of things be
ing done in the wrong way. They say there's a wrong
way and a right way to do everything. In taking care of
your money the right way is to deposit it in a good bank
like ours where it will be perfectly safe yet subject to your
check whenever needed. . No need to tell about the wrong
ways to handle your money. It's the right way that
needs to be known and followed.
