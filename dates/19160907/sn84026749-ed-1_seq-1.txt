N.Y. CAR LINES
Normal Service in Subway and
on Elevated and Surface
, Lines, Despite Order.
LITTLE DISORDER REPORTED
Shonts and General Manager
Hedley, of Interborough,. Ig
nore Subpoenas to Hearing.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7. Despite
a strike order intended to affect
18,000 employes, of the subway,
elevated and New York Railways
systems the latter surface cars
and tie up the -traffic of New York,
normal service was being main
tained today.
William . B. Fitzgerald, strike
leader, admitted that the motormen
of subway and "L" trains had not
responded to the strike call. Trains
on these linees, handling the bulk
of the city's passenger traffic, were
running on regular schedule.
Places of guards on the cars were
taken by strike breakers in many
instances.
Little disorder was reported,
and such reports as reached the
police were not serious.
ONLY THREE CASES.
Three cases of disorder were re
ported by 10 o'clock. Reserves were
ordered out in answer to a call from
Ninety-seventh and Lexington avenufi
where cara were being atoned. On
Tenth aVenue and. Avenue A cars were
pelted with over-ripe vegetables.
Police reported" only about 10 to IS
per cent of the surface cars of the
New York Railways Compay were In
operation.
Organizer Fitzgerald admitted dur
ing the morning that the motormen on
the subway and elevated lines had
not joined the strike. He said he had
expected them to remain at work, as
it had been established several days
ago they would not quit.
Fitzgerald dented the claim of the
Interborough that nomal service Was
being maintained. He said this was
impossible In view of the number of
men out. He refused to estimate the
number on strike, but declared he
was still confident the strike would be
successful.
Public Service Commissioner Straus
waa given a surprise when he called
a hearing on the strike situation at
11 o'clock. Neither President Shonts,
of the Interborough. nor General
Manager Hedley -appeared, although
they had accepted subpoenas.
"Too Busy" to Attend.
Attorney Arthur Peacock said both
ware "busy In the Interests of the
ptfbltc, in keeping their cars run
ning." Straus ordered that either
Bhonts or Hedley appear Immediately.
James Vahey, of Boston, was recog
nised by the commission to submit
fcnargument for the men.
Thousands of men and women, fear
ing trouble on the subway or elevated
lines, went to work this morning In
"Jitneys." which appeared In droves
overnight, or clambered aboard motor
buses or the slow moving surface
cara of such lines as were still In
operation.
The Interborough Rapid Transit
Company, operating the subway and
elevated trains, claimed that prac
tically all of their trains left the barns
on schedule this morning. Taking ad
vantage of the release of strike
breakers in various cities by the call
ing off of the railroad strike last
week, hundreds of man were hurried
here and were held In readiness to
take the place of regular employes
who walked out.
At police headquarters it wan as
serted that all reports of brick throw

Interborough Company had proved to

the whirr of the aeroplanes, one who
listens may near tne crncxing or ret

Fatal to Ohio Man
Dr. H. G. Huffman, Oculist, Vic
tim of His "Nature Cure,"
in Youngstown Hospital.
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Sept. 7. Dr.
H. G. Huffman, oculist and advocate
of fasting as a nature cure, died here
today at the City Hospital, a victim
of his belief after going without food
for sixty-nine days.
Huffman began nis fatal fasting
June 30 at his open air camp on the
Grand river near Geneva. After a
foodless period of forty days he at
tempted to eat, but his stomach re-fi-sed
to accept nourishment.
Despite warnings from friends Huff
man Insisted the rebellion of IiIh stom
ach was trivial and that a resumption
of fasting would help nature rid his
system of poisons.

successful attempts to eat the oculist
became delirious. Thin and emaciated
he waH removed to Dr, C. A. Davis'
nature sanitarium near here and
thence to the Cltv Hosnltal vesterdav.
Fasting was the weapon with which
the oculist thought he was fighting
e'eath. Two years ago doctors told him
he had not long to live.
He went to his camp and fasted
forty-seven days, returning to his
home stronger and greatly Improved.
Last year he fasted thirty days.

In a last desperate effort to postpone

the way he was doing It.
"I think the clerk ought to read It
so we can understand It," said Pen

ALLIEllifSSING
TERMS OF PEACE
Cession of Helgoland and Neu
tralization of Kiel Canal
Among Conditions.
The allies are discussing now among
themselves possible peace terms with
the central powers that are harsher
than any heretofore suggested. Here
are some new demands likely to be
made on Germany:
1. The ceding to England of Helgo
land. 2. Neutralisation of the Kiel canal.
3. Demolition of some of the strongest
fortifications on the German borders.
This list was obtained today by the
United Press from an official In close
touch with allied sentiment both In this
country and abroad.
The fact that they believe the military
situation Is c-onstsnlty Improving, from
their standpoint. Is responsible, this of
ficial said, for the allies allowing some
thing to be known regarding the condi
tions under which they will consent to
make peace.
Many Demand "Crushing."
There are many officials among the al
lied nations whose desires to see Ger
many "absolutely crushed" leads them
propose evep harsher terms than those
listed. In order to break down the power
of centralized Germany, It Is said these
men are In favor of offering lenient
peace terms to adjoining states willing
to sever their political connection with
the empire. Bulgaria, said to be less In
sympathy with Prussian rule than
many of the other federated states, may
accept such an offer, allied diplomats
think.
The main concern of the allies Is not
how long the war will last, but how
thoroughly Germany can be conquered,
the United Press' Informant said. A
peace dictated by the allies at Berlin
after a triumphant march through Ger
many to Vienna waa declared not at
all Improbable.
Helgoland Thought Worthless.
Helgoland, the great German naval
base In the North sea, was purchased
by Germany from England some jears
aco, when the latter thought It worth
less. Germany, however, has made It
nn almost Impregnable fortress, and
during the wnr It has served as a base
for light cruisers, submarines, and .cp
pellns. The Kiel canal, which was developed
simultaneously with the German navy
under Admiral von Tlrpltz. at present
makes It difficult to bottle up the Ger
man navy uhen based there.

PAR18, Bfipt. 7. Combles and Chaul
nes, two main supports of the present
German lines on 'the Somme, are being
pocketed and threatened with early cap
ture by the steady advance of the al
lies. The thrust that carried the French
lines through the greater part of the
village of Berny-en-8anterre and into
the outskirts of Chaulnes yesterday af
ternoon was made In the face of most
desperate German resistance. The Ger
mans defended their positions with
great stubbornness, and time and again
counter attacked.
The French advanco brought General
Foch's line still closer to the Chaulnes
Peronne railway. Another sharp drive
forward will cut this German Una of
