getting a wealth of publicity as a re
sult of its determination to adopt
one breed of hogs. -
"The most substantial thing any of
of the bankers have done in the state,
is to buy brood sows in the quantity
the Marion county bankers have re
cently bought them," says Mr. Spen
cer. "If the farmers and farmer's boys
will hold up the standard they have
undertaken there should be about
1,000 pure-bred Hampshire hogs from

distributed throughout the county.
Surely it does not take a far-sighted
business man many minutes to see
the substantial side of such a prop
osition," Mr. Spencer says.
