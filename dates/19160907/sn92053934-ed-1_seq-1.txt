WOMEN DEBATE
PARTY METHODS
Carrie Chapman Catt Rouses Oratori
cal Impmlse In Resolution Before
the Convention.
Atlantic City, X. J., Sept. 7. Dele
gates to the annual convention of the
National American "Woman Suffrage
association were prepared today for
another debate on the method of con
ducting its campaign in the future.
It was thought this question was
6ettled yesterday when the associa
tion voted to continue its present pol
icy of pressing both national and state
legislation, but later Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt. president, offered a resolu
tion interpreting that article F of the
association constitution, which pledges
auxiliaries to secure votes for women
by national and state legislation, to
mean that the federal amendment is
the immediate and principal aim and
that state efforts are only preparatory
to that end.
The presentation of this resolution
caused a stir among delegates favor
ing state rights. Miss Laura Clay of
Kentucky declared she would take the
floor against the Catt resolution.
i The National American Woman Suf
frage association convention today
changed its constitution so as to bar
from membership all organizations not
in harmony with the policy and con
stitution of the association.
The annual address of Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, president of the asso
ciation, was the feature of the after
noon session.
REPUBS STAGE RIOT;
BEAT UP CHAIRMAN
Chicago, Sept. 7. Friends of Mor
ton D. Hull, a candidate for governor
of Illinois on the republican ticket,
were today searching for the men who
last night broke up a Hull political
meeting on the south side, after beat
ing Chairman Gus W. Tiberg until he
was unconscious and terrorizing the
audience.
The trouble started,- when one of the
speakers was interrupted by someone
in the audience, and soon grew Into a
riot. Tiberg was not seriously in
jured. THE WAR TODAY
The captnre of German first line
trenches over a front of one mile
before Verdun was announeed to
day. The ground was won in the
loner contested sector east of the
Mense between the Vaux-Chnpitre
reerion and the town of Chenols. It
is in this sector, where the Ger
mans most nearly approached a
detinite breach in the defenses of
the city, that the heaviest Iteming
has been in progress recently.
On the Somme front the princi
pal activity of last night was on
the initiative of the Germans, who
made a determined effort to re
capture from the British the small
section of trround along the Guille-mont-Combles
highway known as
Lenze wood.
An Intimation that the Somme
offensive may soon be dropped for
the winter is contained in a dis
patch from the British front. A
staff ofticer is quoted as saying that
if the British wait until vpriiur be
fore making fnrther great efforts
there will be available four times
the present great quantity of artil
lery and correspondingly vast
(tores of ammunition.
PetroKTad reports that the city
of Hal hz, 00 miles southeast of
Lemberg, is under Russian bom
bardment and In flames. The cap
ture of railroad lines in this vicin
ity also is reported.
Since the openinar of the new
Russian drive the heaviest pres
sure has been directed against the
Austro-Orman lines above and be
low Lemberg and there has been
constant fighting before Halicz.
This city is on the trunk line rail
road running southeast from Lem
berg to Stanislau and Kolomea. and
Is also the southern terminus of
another line. Its strategic Impor
tance is Indicated further by the
fact that it is on the Dniester at Its
function with the Gnlta LIpa.
The French have occupied the
environs of Chaulnes and thrown
their troops along the railroad
from that point to Roye. German

GOTHAM GAR
m STRIKE
OVER UNIONS
Subway and "L" Trains Are
Being Run Under Pro
tection of Police.
AFTER SURFACE LINES
Company Employs 3,000
Strike-Breakers in Effort
to Keep Traffic on Move.
ew York, Sept. 7, A million
or more residents of ew York
left their homes this morning not
knowing whether they would ride
fo work or walk. The first test of
the strike declared last night by
the union employes of the elevated
and subway railways came with
the morning rush hours on these
main arteries of travel between
the two ends of .Manhattan Island.
If the carmen can carry out their
threats to halt surface as well as sub
way and elevated traffic, New York
faces the biggest and most vital strike
in its history. The geographic forma
tion of Manhattan island long and
narrow the wide distribution of pop
ulation of the greater city and the con
centration of the business, make New
York particularly susceptible to any
interruption of street car traffic.
When workers started for their
places of employment today, the Amal
gamated Association of Street and
Electric Railway Employes had been
unable to tie up the subway and ele
vated lines, but had succeeded in
crippling some of the most important
surface lines.
"With the aid of nearly 3,000 strike
breakers and under police protection,
the Interborough Rapid Transit com
fKtuy vras" running its trains on sub
way and "L" almost on normal sched
ules. The strike of the Interborough
employes has spread, however, to the
carmen of the New York Railways
company, which operates all but two
of the important surface lines in the
boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx,
Lines in Brooklyn in the system of
the Brooklyn Rapid Transit company
are thus far at peace. Approximately
18,000 employes are affected.
What Caused Strike.
The immediate cause of the strike
is the refusal of the Interborough
company to release the men from an
agreement to seek no further improve
ment in working conditions for a per
iod of two years after the advance in
pay which the men received last
month. Behind these demands, how
ever, is a contest over the unioniza
tion of the street car workers.
The union employes of the Interbor
ough company voted to strike ct 9:30
o'clock last night. During the night
an elevated train was pelted with brick
bats, the passengers were taken off
and the train sent back empty to the
terminal with a few broken windows.
About midnight several hundred men
crowded into the subway at the Grand
Central railway station and induced all
the ticket choppers and platform
guards to leave their jobs. The com
pany quickly filled their places.
Traction chiefs declared that they
could maintain service, but expressed
fear that police protection would not
be adequate. The public service com
mission has started a general inves
tigation of the strike.
Up to noon the city appeared only
slightly affected.
Union leaders, who demand abroga
tion by the company of the so-called
"master and servant" contracts bind
ing the employes not to ask wage in
creases for two years, claimed that
9,000 men had walked out, including
4,000 on the subway and elevated sys
tems. Traction officials asserted not more
than 2,000 men had quit and that with
the aid of strike breakers the company
was maintaining normal schedules on
subway and "L." The "Green car"
system, operated by the New York
Railways company, was chiefly affect
ed, apparently not more than thirty
per cent of these surface cars running.
Except in Manhattan and the Bronx
boroughs no railway linea were af
fected. In Harlem and on the east side there
were a few minor disturbances. The
New York Railways company announc
ed that men who did not strike will
receive double pay until further notice.
Several instances of elevated trains
being bombarded with stones and bot
tles thrown from rooms were reported
to the police shortly before 9 o'clock.
Reserves rushed to the 6cenes of dis
order, entered the buildings and
chased from the roofs gangs of men
said to have been seen carrying mis
Biles. At 9 o'clock the Interborough re
ported that express and local trains
were running on normal schedule.
Chicago Signs Breakers.
Chicago, Sept. 7. More than 1,000
men have been signed here to act as
strike-breakers in New York, it was
learned today after the departure last
night of James T. Waddell, who is
called by many the "boss" strike-breaker
of the country.
Waddell left for New York in a spe
cial train with 157 experienced street
car and elevated men. They rode in
baggage cars. '
Bandits Raid
Rock Island
Train West
Douglas, Ariz.. Sept. 7. Six masked
bandits who last night held up the
Golden State Limited of the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific railway near
Apache, 40 miles east of Douglas, early
today were being trailed by a sheriff's
posse.
The attempted robbery was a com
plete failure.
The bandits after six attempts to
blow open the safe of the express car
abandoned the Job and disappeared on
cow ponies. The passengers were not
molested. One shot was fired at the
mail clerk.
Two of the robbers boarded the ten
der at Apache, covered the engine
crew with revolvers, and after the
first three cars were detached were
joined by four companions awaiting at
a camp fire nearby.
MUSTER GUARDS
OUT OF SERVICE
But Jlilitla ow On Border Remain
For the Present In Federal
Army.
Washington, Sept. 7. The 15,000
guardsmen returned from the border
by the recent order of the war depart
ment were today ordered mustered out
of the federal service. The guardsmen
remaining on the border stay there for
the present.
The war department official an
nouncement follows:
"The secretary of war directs that
all the organizations of the national
guard in the federal service, recently
ordered from the border to their re
spective mobilization camps be mus
tered out of the federal service as soon
' as practicable and returned to the
normal statute of national guard
groups, except in the case of the Four
teenth New York regiment, which is to
be held in service at its mobilization
camp pending the prevalence In that
regiment of para-typhoid.
-As-srron as.it can . be jsafely doug
this regiment also wilj'j) mastered
out. Similar precaution shoftid be tak
en with any other organization return
ing from the border suffering from any
infection or which is under suspicion
of being infected."
The troops affected are three regi
ments from New York, two from New
Jersey, one from Maryland, two from
Illinois, two from Missouri, one from
California, one from Oregon, one from
Washington, and one from Louisiana.
These units comprise in the aggre
gate about 15,000 national guardsmen.
The plan for the mustering out of
the regiments will be executed under
the various departmental commanders
within whose jurisdiction these or
ganizations are placed. In many in
stances, where there is no reason to
hold them because of disease infection,
the mustering out will be done immed
iately. All organizations composed exclu
sively of students were ordered mus
tered out of the federal service. The
order, however, does not affect indi
vidual students enrolled as such in
national guard organizations.
Chicago, Sept. 7. Orders were sent
out from the central division of the
army ordering the mustering out of
federal service Company A, Colorado
engineers, and A battery, Colorado
field artillery. F battery of the Illi
nois field artillery. F battery of the
Minnesota field artillery, and B battery
of the Indiana field artillery also were
ordered mustered out.
The band of the Second Indiana in
fantry, and I company of the First In
diana infantry also were included in
the order.

PHELAN CLUB
TAKEN FROM
REVENUE ACT
Conferees Argue Danger to
American Interests in For
eign Countries.
ABANDON FISH ISSUE
Expected Adjournment of
Congress Not Likely Be
fore Saturday Night.
Washington, Sept. 7. Conferees
on the revenue bill today struck
out the Phelan amendment to em
power the president to retaliate
against citizens of belligerent na
tions which interfere with United
States mails. The argument which
prevailed in the conference was
that it might work great hardships
to Americans in foreign countries
by counter retaliation.
The conference also abandoned the
Chamberlain amendment to prohibit
admission of Pacific ocean salmon or
halibut through a foreign country ex
cept in bond from an American port.
This, it ,was decided, might develop a
commercial war with Canada and
bring about retaliation against Amer
ican Atlantic coast fisheries.
Conferees on the revenue bill were
at work early today after a prolonged
night session, but no assurance ex
isted that their report could be sub
mitted before tomorrow, or that con
gress would adjourn before Saturday.
Tentatively the conferees had agreed
to eliminate senate proposals for
stamp taxes on various kinds of com
mercial papers and steamship and
Pullman tickets, to abandon the house
provision for tax on copper refiners,
and. to increase from 10io 124 per
cent the net profit tax on munitions
manufactured in order to raise $5,000,
000 additional which the stamp taxes
would have supplied. The continuing
appropriation for the tariff commission
also was reported to have been strick
en out.
Agree on Other Amendments.
Other senate amendments clothing
the president with retaliatory power
against interferences with American
commerce and embargoes on Ameri
can goods to foreign nations was
agreed to.
The conference then approached the
wine taxes and dyestuff tariff which
became the principal stumbling
blocks.
Majority Leader Kitchln moved to
strike out the senate amendments in
creasing the duties on coal tar, medic
inal derivatives and flavoring extracts.
There was no fight, however, on In
creases in the rates on intermediate
and finished dyestuffs.
The conference eliminated the $300,-
000 continuing an appropriation for the
tariff commission.
The house managers yielded the de
mand for restoration of the tax on cop
per when the senate conferees threw
out the stamp taxes.
The income, inheritance and corpo
ration stock taxes as fixed in the senate
bill were approved.
Revision of the wine tax schedule and
the Phelan amendment authorizing re
taliatory action by withholding mail
and communication privileges from
citizens of foreign governments which
discriminated against American trade
was being considered.
Among the provisions whose reten
tion it was thought would be recom
mended are the license tax on corpor
ation stock, increased duty on dye
stuffs, higher income and inheritance
taxes, tariff commission and the re
taliatory steps against foreign ships.
Owen Pushing Ills Bill.
Senator Owen was intent today on
continuing his fight for the corrupt
practices bill.
There was a possibility that another
senate executive session might be held
today to consider the treaty for pur
chase of the Danish West Indies.
Pending the revenue bill report, the
conferees on the general deficiencies
bill were holding up their recommen
dations. The conference committee had not
reached final agreement when the
house met, but they were reaching
the stage of mutual concession. In hope
of getting an agreement some time to
day. The delay threatens to postpone
adjournment until Saturday.
Agreement on the wine tax and dye
stuffs tariff in the revenue bill was
reached by the conferees shortly be
fore 4 o'clock and the committee rush
ed their report toward completion for
submission to the house tonight, and
possibly to the senate, should the
house act In time.

ENGLISH EDITOR
SENDS WARNING
Manchester Guardian Makes Sensible
Comment on Black List Opinion
In America.
London, Sept. 7, (10:20 a. m.) Com
menting on the amendment to the reve
nue bill passed by the United States
senate Tuesday night, empowering the
president to retaliate against interfer
ence with American commerce, the
Manchester Guardian says that al
though those who see In it no more
than a flourish having a special virtue
on the eve of election may be right,
"nevertheless, we should do well to
note two things.
"First: These reprisals are directed
against the allies, and primarily
against ourselves. Second: They are
popular lnAgierJfA'.' - .
The Guardian considers it Is not gen
erally realized here how strong a
sentiment has been aroused through
out the United States by the black list
policy and interference with mails, and
asks 'if the foreign office is convinced
these practices of our are so useful as
to counterbalance the weakening of
American sympathy they involve, or
that they cannot be modified so as to
meet American objections without
seriously impairing any utilities they
may have for ourselves."
