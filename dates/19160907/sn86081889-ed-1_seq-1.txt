BIG COVE BARN BURNT.
Harvey Meilott Loses Big Barn, A
Thousand Bushels of Wheat and
forty Tons of Hay.
Tuesday afternoon about two
o'clock Rankin Meilott pulled his
steam threshing outfit up to
Harvey Mellott's barn in Ayr
township and in a few minutes
threshing had begun. Only twenty-four
bushel3 of wheat hud
gone through the machine, when
it was discovered that the barn
was afire. The afternoon was
very warm-, there was a strong
wind blowing, and it was but a
few moments until the whole
building was a roaring mass of
flames. It was with difficulty
that the young men in the wheat
mow escaped. By quick action
the Beparater was drawn by the
traction engine to a place of safe
ty. By means of the telephone and
numerous automobiles in tne
Cove, a large crowd of men were
soon upon the scene, but outside
of their being able to save the
other buildings, they were pow
erless to save the barn or any of
its contents.
A large straw stack at the
Archie Johnston barn was in
great danger and the roof of the
tenant house on that farm was
afire more than once.
The barn which was 40x90 was
erected before the Civil War by
James Kendall, I, for his son
David, who with his family own
ed and lived upon the farm for
thirty-eight years, Harvey Mei
lott buying the farm only a few
years ago.
Mr. Meilott is carrying fifteen
hundred dollars insurance on the
barn and contents in the Lurgan
Fire Insurance Company, which
will about cover the loss of the
wheat:
Some Hotel Man.
From a Kansas City, Mo., pa
per of August 26th, we clip the
following: "F. W. Eitemiller,
president of tho Southwestern
Greeters and already manager
and one of the proprietors of the
Bonaventure hotel, Kansas City,
added another to his list when
he last week purchased the Go
tham hotel at Admiral Boulevard
and the Pasco. Mr. Eitemiller
has taken charge of the property
changed the name to the Hotel
Winton and will continue to oper
ate the Bonaventure also.
The Winton wa3 erected about
six years ago, contains 70 rooms
all with private and connecting
bath and all outside. The hotel
caters mostly to high class resi
dential patronage but also is so
accessible to the downtown dis
trict that it appeals to transients
desiring to avoid the noise.
The new proprietor has been
in Kansas City three years all of
the time at the Bonaventure. Be-
i
fore that he was in the hotel
business in Syracuse, N. Y., for
five years.
Auto Upset.
Last Sunday, while Dick Fish
er, in his Ford car, was bringing
Ed Bender and Ellis Unger down
the west side of Cove Mountain,
he struck the culvert wall at the
left hand side of the pike while
making a short turn, with the
result that the machine was up
set and the occupants pinned un
der it. Help from passing autos
was soon at hand and the three
were released. Fisher and Ben
der escaped with practically no
injury, but Unger was not so for
tunate. - He was badly bruised
and .sprained about the right
shoulder and arm.JOne hipandone
ankle were cut by glass from the
wind shield. The auto was badly
wrecked, two wheels and an axle
having been demolished and the
top smashed.
After having spent a delight
ful time in the Maine woods this
summer John Rex Irw in came
back to civilization a few days
ago looking as hearty as a pine
knot with which he kindled the
camp fire 3.

Stories From Delaware.
Last week, Mr. H. H. Cleven
ger came home to get ready to
remove his family and household
goods to their new home near
Wilmington, Delaware, where
Mr. Clevenger is superintendent
of a large stock farm. If they
can pack the goods in time, they
will leave latter part of this week
They will be greatly missed on
the Hill, for during their short
residence in town they made
many close friends.
On Monday of last week, Mr.
Clevenger and several friends
went fishing at Anglesea, and
they sailed out about twenty miles
into the deep water where they
caught many large fish. The
greatest excitement of the day
was caused by the capture of a
man-eating shark that weighed
380 pounds. Mr. Clevenger said
it required half an hour to reel in
and get the monster into the boat.
Mr. Clevenger furnished us
with a clipping from a WcstChes
ter paper giving an account of a
fire that burned for nearly a
week in a large barn without set
ting fire to the wood work. Some
time during Wednesday of last
week, fifty tons of hay in a very
large Colonial barn near where
he is located was set fire by spon
taneous combustion. A stream
of water from a powerful engine
wa3 poured into the burning
mow. As long water flowed the
flames were held in check, but
when the hose burst, the flames
were seen to leap into even fierc
er activities. This action was
kept up Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday, and on Saturday
when Mr. Clevenger left for Mc
Connellsburg, the mow was still
burning. The weight of water in
the hay had broken down the
floors of the mow, but very little
of the wood work of the building
had been injured. Theotherend
of the barn contained a wealth
of grain which the firemen were
making all efforts to save.
Cito's "Red-Lotter" Day.
About eight years ago, when
Rev. C. W. Bryner was pastor of
the M. E. church in McConnells
burg, the part of his congrega
tio living in the neighborhood of
Cito concluded to build a church
for the accomodation of the Cove
members. As a result, a very
neat and up-to-date building was
erected, and since that time,
they have had regular preaching
services. However, the new con
gregation was in debt, and some
of the workers decided that it
should be paid off. A canvass of
the congregation was made, and
not only was sufficient funds
raised to pay the debts, but
enough extra was given to buy
a new organ and music books
and a small sum put into the
treasury for other purposes. Last
Sunday afternoon was set as the
time for celebrating the clear
ance of the debt. It certainly
was a day of rejoicing and thanks
giving on the part of the mem
bers. Dr. Fasick preached in the
afternoon and evening.' Special
programs .of music were render
ed. Mrs. C. B. Stevens, Mr3.
Geo. W. Reisner, and Miss Doro
thy Hamil, were among the Mc
Connellsburg people who assist
ed in the music and helped make
it a "Red-Letter Day" in the
history of the Cito congregation.
Ileasait Guests.
On Wednesday of last week,
an automobile party composed of
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Fraker, with

derall of Dry Run, spent the
day very pleasantly with Mr.
and Mrs. Fraker's son-in-law and
daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse B.
Heefner, near Gracey. Mrs.
Fraker and Mrs. Alexander are
siLters, and it was a pleasant day
spent by all. Tho Alexanders
were guests in the Fraker home
a week.
HARRIS OPENS CAMPAIGN.
Addressed Crowd of Several Thousand
at I'icnic at Leonard's Grove
Last Wednesday.
Blairs Mills, Aug. 30. George
A. Harris Democratic candidate
for Congress in the 17th District
was one of the speakers at the
Leonard's Grove picnic and ad
dressed a crowd of several thou
sand, from Juniata, Mifflin Hunt
ingdon and Franklin counties.
Mr. Harris before and after
the speaking met many of the
people and Irom the expressions
heard he made many friends.
Many think this was the real op
ening of his campaign for con
gress as he briefly outlined and
discussed several issues of the
day and made it clear that the
people would be enlightened from
now on about the record of the
present congress and how the
Seventeenth district was repre
sented. He said in part:
"My friends, I believe when
you invited me to participate in
your program to-day, you expect
ed me to talk with you awhile
about some of the things about
which we are all interested and
the things that vitally concern
the people of the Seventeenth
Congressional district in particu
lar. "The Seventeenth congression
al district, as you know, compris
es eight counties with a combin
ed area of a little over 4000
square miles and a combined pop
ulation of a little over .200,000
people. In 1914 there were cast
34,213 votes for congress in this
district. I take it that these vot
ers including a large number who
did not vote, are vitally interest
ed in the legislation that has
been enacted during the past two
years, especially legislation that
effects the farmer, for "we are
without a doubt an agricultural
district. We have in our district
some good sized towns, but di
rectly or indirectly every citizen
of this district is dependent upon
the farmers.
"For a number of years the
farmers through the United
States have advocated the de
manded legislation that would
aid the farmer in a financial way
but it was not until the present
congress that their hopes and de
mands were realized. I refer to
the Rural Credits bill popularly
known as the Farm Loan Bill.
"In 1912 the three political
platforms Democratic, Rebubli
can and progressive pledged Na
tional legislation upon Rural Cre
dits. All political parties con
ceded the need of such legislation
therefore the movement was non
partisan. On July 17, 1916 Pres
ident Wilson affixed his signature
to this bill, which was witnessed
by the prominent officers of the
Grange and farm organization,
thus one of the greatest of mea
sure to help agriculture in the
United States became a law.
"This legislation is for the far
mer what the Federal Reserve
system is for the merchants and
the manufacturers. It will es
tablish twelve Federal Loan Bills
throughout the country, under
the supervision of the govern
ment, from which money may be
secured by farmers at a reason
able rate and for a long term of
years if needed.
"In the west, south and south
west, farmers have to pay on an
average of ten per cent for mon
ey and as high as 18 and 20 per
cent and then run the risk of
foreclosure when the mortage is
due.
"Can vou imagine any good
reason why a member of Con
gress elected by and represent
ing an agricultural district would
not vote for this legislation. If
I would stand here to-day and
advocate legislation to help the
farmer and you would elect me
to congress and then I would not
stand up and vote for the farmer
would you vote to return me to
Congress to misrepresent you?
I don't believe you would and I
LABOR.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Man was intended to labor by
the all wise Creator. Our men
tal and physical make-up is such
that occupation is essental to
continued well-being.
From the hunter, the fisher
man and the rude agriculturist,
man has envolved a complicated
civilization. There are thousands
of occupations to-day in place of
the few primitive ones; but still
the majority of these center
about the fulfilling of the primary
necessities feeding and clothing
mankind.
It has become impossible for
the laborer to work under the
conditions which originally ob
tained. Besides the fields and
forests we have mine, mill and
mart
Man has progressed mentally
to a remarkable degree, but we
cannot say that of his physical
development. However, his re
quirements are much the same
as those of our remote ancestors.
Sunlight, fresh air, pure water,
and physical exercise are abso
lutely essential to the mainten
ance of health.
If the conditions under which
men and women labor do. not
make this possible, they are det
rimental to the individual and to
society at large; for upon the
health of its people, depends the
ultimate future of any nation.
No machinery can entirely re
place the sinews of labor.
To be healthy and happy one
must love his work.
Visiting Parents.
Mr. and Mrs. William P. Nel
son, whose marriage was noted
by the" News last week, are vis
iting the grooms parents Hon.
and Mrs. David A. Nelson and
other relatives in the Cove. The
bride is a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. John Frey, and the mar
riage took place at high noon,
August 30th, at the home of the
bride's parents about five miles
northwest of Newville, Cumber
land county. The ceremony was
performed by Rev. Daniel Ket
terman, pastor of the St. Paul's
Lutheran church at Newville.
The bride's parents are success
ful, and highly respected farm
ers, devoting their time chiefly
to the production of vegetables
for which they find a ready mar
ket in the prosperous Cumber
land Valley towns. Mr. Nelson
is well known to our readers and
he will take charge of the home
farm next April.
don't think I would ask you to
do so.
"Your present congressman
did not vote for this legislation.
In speaking of Americanism
and Patriotism, Mr. Harris touch
ed on the record of Mr. Focht on
the McLemore resolution when
he said "On March 8, last, the
McLamore resolution was voted
upon in the house of representa
tives, the purpose of said resolu
tion w.s to warn American citi
zens that if they took passage on
merchant ships of belligerent na
tions, they would dp so at their
own risk. The purpose was to
sacrifice one of the rights of our
citizens, in other words our Gov
ernment would not uphold our
citizens in the exercise of their
rights. Party lines were obliter
ated and ninety-three patriotic
Republican Congressman voted
with the Democrats to kill the
resolution and uphold the rights
of American citizens. Where
did the representative of theSev
ententh district stand on this
resolution? Did he vote the pa
triotic sentiment of our 200,000
people or did he vote to surren
der our rights as American citi
zens to foreign powers? The
records show that he voted a
gsinst American rights."
Mr. Harris spoke enthusiasti
ally about the good roads bill.
