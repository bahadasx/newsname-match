Topeka, Kan., Sept. 7.—E. W. Ripley,
president of the Atchison, Topeka and

in a formal statement that the Santa

Adamson eight-hour law, recently en
acted by congress to avert a threat
ened railroad strike, until ordered to
do so by the United States supreme
court.
Mr. Ripley's statement follows:
"Congress, hastily acting under a
threat of four leaders of labor organi
zations, enacted a so-called eight
hour law, which is nothing more nor
less than an advance of 20 to 25 per
cent in the wages of the best paid men
in the railway service. It ls only fair
to the publio and to our employes to
say thai the Santa Fe does not intend
to comply with the law until ordered
to do so by the court of last resort.''

No Power to Be Given President to
Retaliate Against Subjects of Foreign
NStions—No Prohiibtion of Fish

Moves Office Force to Summer Capi
tal at Asbury Park, N. J.
Washington, Sept. 7.—Conferees on
tho emergency revenue bill today
struck out the Phelan amendment to
empower the president to retaliate
against citizens of belligerent nations
which interfere with United States
mails. The argument which prevailed
in the conference was that it might
work great hardships to Americans in
foreign countries by counter retalia
tion.
The conferees also abandoned the
•Chatrfberlain amendment -to prohibit
adimlssion of Pacific ocean salmon or
halibut thru a foreign country except
1n bond from an American port. This,
it was decided, might develop a com
mercial war with Canada and bring
about retaliation against American
•Atlantic coast fisheries.
Pension Bill Passes Senate.
A bill giving widows of officers or
enlisted men who served in the civil
war or Mexican war or the war of
1812, and who have reached the age of
70 years, pensions of $20 a month in
stead of the present $12 a month
passed the senate. It already has
passed the house.
Widows of veterans dropped from
the rolls because of second marriages
are restored by the bill.
President Wilson signed the shipping
bill today. It authorizes government
organization of a corporation or cor
porations with a capitalization of not
more than $50,000,000 to buy and lease
ships and put them In trade if they
can not be leased and put in operation
w'ith private capital.
Other Clauses Accepted.
Other senate amendments, clothing
the president with retaliatory power
against interference with American
commerce, and embargoes on^merican
goods to foreign nations, were agree*!
tov ,„T£ey.. the. &&otlop .of Jh^:
state department, .while the Phelan
amendment did not.
The- conferees then approached the
wine, taxes and dye stuffs. Majority
Leader Kltchin moved to strike out
the senate amendments Increasing the
duties on coal tar, medicinal deriva
tives and flavoring extracts. There
was no fight, however on the increases
in the rates on intermediate and fin
ished dye stuffs.
The'conference eliminated the $300,
000 continuing appropriation for the
tariff commission. Three hundred
thousand dollars was retained for
1917, but as the bill now stands the
appropriation for future years was
eliminated.
The income. Inheritance and corpo
ration taxes, as fixed In the senate bill,
were approved.
Capitals Changed.
All arrangements were completed to
day for the transfer of the executive
offices of the White House from Wash
ington to Asbury Park, N. J., tomor
row. For the first time since Mr. Wil
son became president a complete staff
of secretaries, clerks, telegraphers and
other attaches will accompany him on
his vacation. *x
Altho President Wilson plans to
spend most of his time at Shadow
Lawn he will go to Asbury Park as
often as necessary to visit the execu
tive offices and attend to public busi
ness. A-suite of rooms has been en
gaged in a modern office building
there.
The president will receive many of
his political visitors at Shadow Lawn,
and the broad porch from which he
delivered his speech of acceptance is
expected to be the scene of frequent
exceptions to democratic leaders.
Because of Mr. Wilson's decision to
make only a few political speeches,
his campaign will be of the front
porch variety. Shadow pawn is an
estate of sixty acres of beautiful lawns.
The house ls within walking distance
of the ocean.
Stamp Taxes Eliminated.
Elimination of all stamp taxes In
the emergency revenue bill, seriously
objected to by the house, was agreed
upon late last night by the conference
committee, house conferees yielding, in
exchange for this concession, their de
mand for restoration of a tax on re
finers of copper.
To make up for the loss of about
$5,000,000 revenue In sacrificing the
stamp taxes the conferees are' ex
pected to agree to a suggestion of
house members that the net profit tax
of manufacturers of munitions of war
be Increased from 10 to 12% per cent.
Regarded as Annoyance*.
Sacrifice of the proposed stamp
taxes puts the revenue bill back in ac
cord with the originaJTleterminatlon of
the administration leaders-to repeal all
provisions in the existing war revenue
law which were generally regarded as
annoyances by the public. The pro
posed stamp taxes, now eliminated, in
cluded bonds, debentures and certifi
cates of stock, agreements of sale, con
veyances. warehouse and custom house
receipts, fcr*'rn "tea-m^Mp ticket* .gnS

CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT
SEES GREAT FUTURE
IN STORE FOR WOMEN
Atlantic City, N. J.. Sept. 7.—Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the
National American Woman's Suffrage
Association, in her address before the
annual convention of the association
here today pictured the suffrage move
ment as having reached a crisis which
means that "The Woman's Hour Has
Struck!" Earnestly, she exhorted the
women not to lose heart but to recog
nize the present opportunity which "If
seized with vigor, enthusiasm and will,
means the final victory of our great
cause in the very near future."
She said, in part:
"The groat war will bring untold
ohanges in its wake it presages a
total change in the status of women.
In Europe, from tho Polar Circle to
the Aegean Sea women have risen and
taken the places made vacant by men,
ami in so doing they have grown in
self-respect and in the esteem of their
respective nations. Indeed, Europe is
realizing as it never did before, that
women are holding together the civili
zation fo." which men are fighting. A
great searchlight has been thrown up
on the business of nation-building arid
it has been demonstrated in every
European land that it is a partnership
with equal but different responsibili
ties resting upon the two partners.
"The war will soon end and the
armies will return to their native
lands. To many a family, the men will
never come back. The husband who
returns to many a wife will eat no
bread the rest of his life save of her
earning.
"What then will happen after the
war? Will the widows left with
families to support cheerfully leave
their well-paid posts for those com
manding lower wages? Not without
protest! The economic axiom, denied
and evaded for centuries will be
emblaronod or. every factory, counting
house and shop: 'Equal pay for equal
work and common Justice will slowly
but surely enforce that law. The
European woman has risen. She may
not realize It yet but the woman 'door
mat' in every land has unconsciously
become a 'door-Jamb. She will have
become accustomed to her new dig
nity by the time the men come home.
»he will wonder how she ever could
have been content lying across the
threshold now that she discovers the
upright Jamb gives so much broader
and more iiiiiTrml a vision of thlnjjs.
"In Great Britain, which was the
storm center of the suffrage move
ment for some years before tne war,
hundreds of hitter, active opponents
have confessed their conversion to
woman suffrage on account of the war
services of women. Already, three
great provlnc.es of Canada, Manitoba,
Alberta and Saskatchewan, have given
universal suffrage to their women in
sheer generous appreciation of., their

war work. Even Mr. Asquith. world
renowned for his immovable opposition
to the parliamentary suffrage for
British women, has given evidence of
a change of view. Some months ago,
he announced his amazement at the
utterly unexpected skill, strength and
resource developed by the women and
his gratitude for their loyalty and de
votion. A public statement Issued by
In August, was couched In

many as a pledge to Include women

'The significance of the changed
status of European women has not
been lost upon the men and women of

unlearned In history, nor so lacking In
national pride that they will allow the
republic to lag long behind the Empire,
presided over by the descendant of
George the Third. If they possess the
patriotism and the sense of nationality
which should be the Inheritance of an
American, they will not wait until the
war is funded but will boldly lead in
the inevitable march of democracy, our
own American specialty.
"As the most adamantine rock gives
way under the constant dripping of
water, so the opposition to woman suf
frage In our own country has slowly
disintegrated before the Increasing
strength of our movtottent.

we spend time In admiring the cap

states is with us. Great men in every
political party, church and movement
are with us. The names of the great
est men and women of art. science,
literature, philosophy, reform, religion
and politics are on our lists.
'We have not won the reactionaries
of any party, church or society and we
never will. From the beginning of
things, there have hcen antls. Before
the vote Is won. there must and will
be a gigantic final conflict between thp
forces of progress, righteousness and
democracy and the forces of ignorance,
evil and reaction. That struggle may
be postponed hut it can not be evaded"
or avoided. There is no question as
to which side will be the victor.
"How can it be done? By a simple
change of mental attitude. If you are
to seize the victory, that change must
take place In this hall, here and now!
The old belief, which has sustained
suffragists In many an hour of dis
couragement 'woman suffrage Is bound
to come' must give way to the new.
the woman's hour has struck.' That
slogan sets the pace of a crusade
hloh will have Its way. It says:
•Awake, arise, my sisters, let your
hearts be filled with Joy—the time of
victory Is here. Onward march.
"All this is mere preparedness for
the final drive to victory. The noxl
question ls: what shall be our aim?
To my mind, the insistence of the n
franchisement of the women of our
land by federal amendent, Is the only
self-respecting course to pursue."
In explaining her reasons for this
stand, .Mrs. Catt .reviewed the fight for
suffrage In many states and the ob
stacles It had met from the liquor in
•ests and charged there had been
widespread resort to Illegal praotlces
to defeat suffrage, whereas in a ma
jority the states of the union—In
twentyiflve of them—there was no
provision made by law for any form of
contest or rccount sr. a referendum.
"Political corrupters may. In these
states, bribe voters, colonize voters,
and repeat them to their hearts con
tent and redreas of any kind is prac
tically Impossible."
'In my Judgment," she concluded,
"the women of thin land, not -,rt!y hr«ve
the right to sit on the steps con
gress until It acts but it ls their .••]*
respecting duty to Insist Mpon their
enfranchisement by that route.'

New York, Sept 7.—A strike was*ln»
augurated on the subway, and elevated V.-i
line and several surface systems of tht
Interborough Rapid Transit Company
today, but up to noon the city appeared
only slightly afteoted.

more than 2,000 men had quit and that
with tho aid of strike-breakers the
company was maintaining normal
schedules on subway and elevated.

Double Psy For Loysl Men.

A million or more residents of New
York left their homes this morning not
knowing whether they would ride to 1
work or walk. The first test of ths i.
strike declared last night by union m
ployes of the elevated and subway-rail
ways came during the rush hours thU
morning. Several instances of slevatsd
trains being bombarded with stones (Mid
bottles thrown from roofs ware reported
ttt the police at .o'clock. .Th^ psljoa.:

Msny Trains Running.
At 9 o'clock the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company repotted that ex-1
press and local trains were running on
schedule and with but few changes In
the regular crews.
The Amalgamated Association ot'
Street and Electric Railway Employes,»
conducting the strike, have failed to
tie up the elevated and subway lines,
but have crippled some of the sur
face lines. The strike of Interborough
employes has spread, however, to the
carmen of the New York Railways
Company, which operates all save two
of the Important surface lines in Man
hattan and the Bronx.
Eighteen Thousand Affected.
Approximately 18,000 employes are
affected. The cause of the strike Is tho
refusal of thtf Interborough company to
release the men from an agreement to
seek no further Improvement In work
ing conditions for a period of two years
after the advance In pay which the men
received last month.
Behind these demands, however, is
the contest over the unionization of tho
street car workers of the city. The
union employes of the Interborough
company voted to strike at 9:30 last
night. In response to the company's
appeal for protection S.000 policemen
were released from patrol duty today
and made available for strike duty.
