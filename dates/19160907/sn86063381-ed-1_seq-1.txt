CONGRESS READY
TO ADJOURN AFTER
NATION'S MOST
EVENTFULSESSION
Sixty-fourth Body to Quit Work Late
Tonight or Tomorrow in Ses
sion Nine Months.
HEAVIEST APPROPRIATIONS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY
Inmportant Measures are Passed No
Vote on Strict Party Lines
During Sessions.
(By United Press)
^Washington, Sept. 7.Inheriting
lis most pressing problems from the
European war and Mexican bandits,
sfcd having had placed before it one
of the most elaborate legislative pro
grams ever known, the sixty-fourth
congress, now in its last hours, prob
ably will go down in history as one
of the nation's most eventful sessions.
Congress, it is believed', will quit
work late this evening Or- tomorrow
after nine months' sessions.
Heaviest Appropriations.
Called on twice to back the presi
dent in step* which- it thought sure
ly meant frtfriwTth Germany, and acfjbors
tually appropriating mtllldns for the
Mexican punitive expedition, it Nev
ertheless found time for half a dozen
ddmestic measures of major import
anceand to approve the heaviest
appropriations in American histor-y\
"Preparedness" led in attention
throughout. The largest naval ap
propriation the world has ever known
in peace-time, and the next-but-on3
largest army budget, were approved
Back of every economic measure
child labor, rural credits, U. S. mer
chant marine, workmen's compensa
tion, was the cry of "industrial pre
paredness
Though the Democratic party never
lost its hold on legislation, and
though President Wilson at all times
was the admitted pilot, not a single
measure passed both houses on strict
party lines.
Sensational Conflict.
The mOst sensational episode of the
session was the fight over the Gore
and McLemore resolutions, warning
Americans off armed merchant ships
after Germany had given notice it
intended torpedoing them. Avowedly
slaps at the president's foreign pol
icy, they bought the chief executive
and congress into sharp conflict.
Leaders of congress called on the
president and warned him if the reso
lutions came to a vote, they would be
approved, two to one The presi
dent's answer was a summary demand
that they be tabled Three or four
days passed while the fight was or
ganized from the White House. Then
his congressional lieutenants struck,
and the resolutions were overwhelm
ed. After that, congressexcept for
one halting exceptionaccepted the
president's leadership in foreign af
fairs without question.
A. short conflict loomed when the
president personally visited the capi
tol, and told congress the had sent
Germany a virtual ultimatum over
the Sussex incident. Suddenly hun
dreds of thousands of telegrams, in
five or six identical forms, poured in
from every section of the country.
There were hundreds of bushels of
them. Astounded, congress wavered
in its attitude.
Cloak Room Jest.
In a smashing speech, Senator Har
ding exposed the demonstration as
backed and financed by a German
American organization. Officials of
the latter admitted it, and the affair
became a Cloakrdom jest.
From the time the session opened,
the pot of Mexican affairs never
Xfceased boiling. Half a dozen Repub
licansled by Fall and Borah in the
senatewere insistent intervention
alists. As the bandit raids into Am
erican territory developed, border
Democrats became restless.
"Watchful waiting" was jeered as
policy of productive only of bandit
contempt and continued outrages.
Eateh outbreak furnished new ammu
nition for interventionist oratory. At
length guardsmen and troops were
sent to the border. The movement
was supported by both parties, al^
though Republicans-charged i'W
a political rather than a military
step. Senator LaFollette pushed
through a resolution pledging the
country against intervention. Alone

of Republicans, he praised President
Wilson's policy.
New Principle.
With the calling of the state troops
a new principle in American military
history was established. For the
first time the president was enabled
to send a national guardsman beyond
the boundaries of his country with
out either the guardsman's or his
state's consent. Under the Hay
Chamberlain army reorganization,
they were simply drafted as the "fed
eral reserve."
Bitter protests from dependents
flooded the capitol. Wives and
mothers of men snatched suddenly
from their livelihoods, appeared per
sonally. Two orders resulted, one re
leasing men with dependents from
serving, and the other paying as high
as $50.00 a month to the families of
those who chose to serve. Two mil
lions was appropriated for this. It
was declared to be one the same
principle as the aid European bellig
erents extend to families of those in
the trenches
Accomplishments.

ing during the session:
Reorganized and tremendously in
