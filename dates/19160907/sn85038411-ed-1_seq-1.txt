RECOGNITION IN BUDGET
2s"eed of Bathing Beaches to Be
Urged; Kipona Prizes
Awarded
Formal presentation of the Navy Cup
to Technical High school, winner of
the "war canoe" race in the rirst anriJil
Kipona, is scheduled for Monday even
ing's meeting of the Greater Harris
burg Navy.
Following this ceremony the Navy
will discuss plans and map out its pro
gram of permanent development for the
Susquehanna basin for whi:h Coun
cil will be asked to make financial
provision in the 1917 budget.
W Bathing beaches, bathhouses, properly
dredged, blasted and marked boat chan
nels—these are only a few of the more
necessary and important improvements
which Harrisburg's great organized
body of canoeists, motorboatmen and
other river enthusiasts will incorpo
rate in the permanent development pro
gram.
For Bathlnf; Reaches
Proper provision for the construction
and maintenance of bathing beaches
will be emphatically demanded, how
ever, and special stress will be laid
upon the necessity for making appro
priation for this feature of the pro
feram in time to establish the bath
house and bathing beaches before the
thousands of Harrisburg folks take to
the water next year.
That the award of the Navy trophy
should be made Monday was definitely
decided last evening by the executive
committee following the presentation
of the gold, silver and bro lze medals
and the tennis rackets, canoe cushion-,
'boxes of cigars, paddles, fountain pens,
sleeve links, bathing caps, and the sore
or more of other articles of merchan
dise to the winners in the Kipona
games. Bowman and Company, which
had been awarded the prize for the
Lbest exhibit in the decorated boat pa-
Irade withdrew and the prize was
lawarded to George Kinzler. the diver.
Thanks to Everybody
I Harrisburg's merchants who Anated
[prizes, those who entered floats, the
thamber of Commerce for its fireworks
liisplav, the telephone and electric light
companies and the Jovian League for
Iheir spendid aid in helping to light
[up and adorn the basin during the
night, were heartily thanked by a
unanimous vote of thanks.
For a couple of hours the commit
tee discussed final details . incident to
the celebration, considered tentative
plan; for some sort of a winter carni
val, and then agreed to get down tr>
business as soon as possible with a
view to getting through the permanent
development program.
The >'eeds
Committees will likely be appointed
Monday evening to take up the various
phases of the problem for bathing
beaches, bathhouses, boathouses and
so on.
While it is generally understood that
the Navy "war canoe'* trophy will be
contested for each year by the Central,
Technical. Steelton High schools and
the Harrisburg Academy, the committee
decided last evening to urge the school
athletic associations to do their share
toward insuring the permanency of
the event by providing equipment, ap
plying the same scholastic standard for
the crews as for the football, baseball,
basketball and track teams.
The Navy Cup is on exhibition in the
display windows of P. G. Diener's
jewelry store.

Flames; Hold Trunk Line
Railroad to Lemberg
The capture of German first line
trenches over a front of one mile be
fore Verdun was announced to-day
by the French War Office. The ground
was won in the long contested sector
east of the Meuse between the Vaux-
Chapitre region and the town of Che
nois. It is in this sector, where the
Germans most nearly approached a
definite breach in the defenses of the
city, that the heaviest fighting has
been in progress recently.
On the Somme front the principal
activity of last night was on the ini
tiative of the Germans. ' ho made a
determined effort to reca <ure from
the British the small secti n of ground
along the Guillemont-Ci nbles high
way known as Leuze wooa. The Ger
man counter attack led to one of the
fiercest one man hand to hand strug
gle with hand grenades and bayonets
which have characterized recent fight
ing along the Somme. London re
ports officially that in the end the
Germans were beaten back.
May Drop Drive
An intimation that the Somme of
fensive may soon be dropped for the
winter is contained in a dispatch from
the British front. A staff officer is
quoted as saying that if the British
wait until Spring before making furth
er great efforts there will be available
four times the present great quantity
of artillery and correspondingly vast
stores of ammunition.
An important Russian victory in
eastern Galicia is indicated by to
