Washington, Sept. 7 The senate
yesterday Indulged In one of the
wildest sessions of Its history, dur
ing a debate on the corrupt practices
bill fathered by President Wilson
and Senator Owen of Oklahoma. At
one point during the proceedings a
personal encounter between Senators
Ashurst of Arizona, a democrat, and
Curtis of Kansas, a republican, was
averted only by teh interference of
Senator Smoot of Utah, another re
publican. At another time Senator
Ashurst called Senator Penrose of
Pensylvanla a liar and refused for a
time to retract his statement, tho it
was wholy out of order, and the
chair and a number of his democratic
colleagues Insisted he retract it Fin
ally he made an equivocal withdraw
al. In opening the debate on the
measure, Senator Owen said the bill
was Intended to prevent corrupt
practices during the present cam
paign. He Intimated strongly the repub
licans were going out to buy up the
country. He asserted the den ocrata
were following the straight and nar
row path and that they Intended to
make the republicans do the same.
Those statements aroused the re
publicans, who pitched Into the de
bate In dead earnest. They asserted
they were willing to have a corrupt
practices act passed, but they didn't
want any hypocrisy about it. Sen
ator Curtis said he did not care to be
personal but he was In Oklahoma
during Senator Owen's recent cam
paign for re-election and the Okla
homa n could be followed around the
state on his trail of large-sized
checks.

The American Aviation Associa

by the sudden death of Captain Mc

and his death put the management
of the fair on their mettle, as they
are determined that the aviation fea

to till the contract made ror the ap
pearance or McMillen. The fair man
agers have bad a new contract
drawn, which provides that the avi

county fair must fly, or he will not
The air currents, here
are rather tickle and there is a good
excuse sometimes for the exhibitor
to refuse to make a flight, but in
that case he will rorfeit his allow
ance. "No fly, no pay" is the slogan
that the rair managers have adopted
and the American Aviation Associa
tion understand that there will be no
deviation from the sentiment of the
directors.
Bowersof is a daring man and hia
flights here will be sensational, be
cause of the capricious air currents
and because he is anxious to fill the
dates of the late Captain McMillen,
so that there will be no protests from
the fair manager or the general public.
