We wish, especially, to ex

Lottie Buck of Huffman, Ark.,
one of our last year's pupils, will
be back in school here this terra,
but will be two or three weeks
late. After leaving here last
May at the close of school Lettie
took the teachers' examination
and made a second grade certin

ployed as primary teacher in her
homo school, where she is now
teaching. Last year Lettie
worked for her board; this year
she writes she has money with
which to pay her board. The
example of this girl in getting
an education is worthy of emula

crown her efforts.

The Grade and High Schools

every teacher present. The en

a most successful term and one

High School offering 13i units,
all being accepted by the Uni
verstiy of the State of Missouri.
Every room and department of
the school is thoroughly equipped
and gives full forty minute
periods. The school is this year
lurnishing free text books forall
grades except the High School
department, being the only
school in the county offering
these inducements. The High
School department for the last
two years has had the honor of
having students from all parts
of the country within 100 miles
in attendance here, thus show
ing the superiority of our school.
For all these benefits our peo
ple can thank our Board of Edu
cation, Superintendent W. H.
Johnson and his corps of able
assistants in the few years past,
and this year we believe they
will surpass any old record.
The Herald tenders to the
Board of Education and the
school our space for any benefit
to the community. Let us be a
part of so noble and successful
institution.
