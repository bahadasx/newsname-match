New Excuse For Evading
Law.
Information has frequently been
given to THE TOMAHAWK that the
regular excuse for evading the
law which provides that Chippe
was shall receive the preference in
the positions in the Chippewa In
dian service, has been that there
are no vacancies.
In an application made recently
by Edward Perrault on behalf of
his father, Joseph E. Perrault, for
a clerkship in the Chippewa ser
vice, the excuse is made by Assist
ant Commissioner of Indian Affairs
E. B. Merritt that practically all
clerical positions in the Chippewa
service require stenographers and
typewriters.
In order that members of the
Chippewa bands of Minnesota may
fully understand the new excuse
for not giving them positions, the
following correspondence between
the Indian office and Congressman
^"Sleenerson and others is herein
given:
Washington, D. C,,
August 25th, 191G.
J. E. Perrault, Esq.,
White Earth, Minn.
My dear Mr. Perrault:
I have your favor of the 22nd
instant, and inclose communica
tions I received from the Indian
t)ffice several days ago, from which
you will observe that the Com
missioner communicated with your
son on August 16th, last. You
are, of course, aware that the
power of appointment in the In
dian Service is in the Secretary of
the Interior, and that the influence
of the Congressman, under present
circumstances, ends with an en
dorsement and recommendation
\jvhich I have given and made as
string as I could. I would sug
gest that you take the matter up
with the Superintendent at your
Agency.
Very truly yours,
H. Steenerson.
.My dear Mr. Steenerson:
have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of Au
gust 14, 1916, including a com
munication from Edward Perrault
relative to the appointment of his
father, J. E Perrault, to a clerk
ship at the White Earth Agency
or elsewhere.
Practically all clercial positions
in this Service require stenograph
ers and typewriters and as it ap
pears that Mr. Perrault is not
^jalified along these lines, no act
ion can be taken in his behalf.
His son has been advised accord
ingly, a copy of Office letter to
jhim being enclosed herewith in
compliance with your request.
Very truly yours,
E. B. Merritt,
Asst. Commissioner.

dated August 11, 1916, relative to
the appointment of your father,
J. E. Perrault, to a clerical posi
tion at the White Eirth Agency

You are advised that practically
all clerkships in the Service re
quire competent stenographers and

your father is not qualified along
these lines, no action can be taken
toward giving him an appoint
ment. ^Signed)

Asst. Commissioner.
When approached by William
Ledeboer and Joseph E. Perrault,
Supt. Hinton admitted the exist
ance of laws giving preference to
Indians as employees in the Indian
service, but in substance told them
these laws were to be ignored.
The United States Statutes con
tain the following laws in relation
to giving Indians the preference
as employees in the Indian ser
vice:
Sec. 2072 U. S. Revised Statutes.
"Where any of the tribe are, in
in the opinion of the Secretary of
the Interior, competent to direct
the employment of their black
smiths, mechanics, teachers, farm
ers, or other persons engaged for
them, the direction of such per
sons may be given to the proper
authorities of the tribe."
Indian Appropriation Act of
May 17, 1882. "And preference
shall at all times, as far as practi
cable, be given to Indians in the
employment of clerical, mechani
cal, and other help on reservations
and about agencies."
Indian Appropriation Act of
August 23, 1894. "That in the
Indian service Indians shall be
employed as herders, teamsters,
and laborers, and where practi
cable in all other employments in
connection with the agencies and
the Indian service."
Indian Appropriation Act of
March 3, 1901. "That as far as
practicable Indian labor shall be
employed and purchase in the
open market made from Indians,
under the direction of the Secre
tary of the Interior."
But particular attention is called
to the Indian appropriation act of
May 18, 1910, in relation to ap
propriations from Chippewa tribal
funds which has the following
provision:
"That not to exceed $60,000 of
said amount, AND the one-fourth
on the tribal funds of the Chippe
wa Indians of Minnesota now to
their credit in the Treasury to be
used for the maintainance of free
schools, shall be used for the com
pensation of employees in the In
dian Service in Minnesota except
for irregular laborers, and that
the said Chippewas shall reveive
the preference in filling permanent
pi- "rt^f^Hit -'p5 r^ ^^^'^v^f-a^h.ww-^TT
/1 rr
positions in the service of the
Chippewas of Minnesota where the
compensation is pu from thpir
tribal funds."
The Chippewa Indian Service is
not strictly speaking the govern
ment service and does not come
within the purview of the civil
service law and for this reason it
is not optional but compulsory
upon the superintendents among
the Chippewas of Minnesota to
create vacancies for Irdian appli
cants for positions in the Chippe
wa service when the persons who
hold the positions are not mem
bers of the tribe in Minnesota.
There is no such qualification in
the Indian appropriation act ofj
last May regarding Indian em-j
ployees as there is in the other(
acts quoted which provide that In-'
dians shall be employed when
practicable, in the government
service.
if the expenses of the service)
i
among the Chippewas of Minne
sota were being borne by the Uni
ted States it might very properly
be called the "government ser
vice", but this is not the case, for
the Chippewas of Minnesota bear
all the expenses of the service
among them, and it is therefore
most appropriate to designate it
as the Chippewa Service.
In order to compel the Indian
office and superintendents of the
Chippewa Indian service to give
preference to the people who are
paying the expenses, Congress
should be appealed to next winter
to provide for a penalty where an
official ignores the law, for it is
evident that only in this way can
the Chippewas hope to have the
law enforced.
It is an absurd excuse that Act
ing Commissioner Merritt has
made that a clerk must be a steno
grapher or typewriter in order to
be a clerk in the Chippewa Indian
service, for there are at least three
clerks who are now in the super
intendent's office here who are not
stenographers and typewriters.
A recent appointee of Supt.
Hinton, Miss Fletcher, is not a
stenographer, at least she is not so
employed in the office, neither is
the issue clerk, Mr. Dummert, a
stenographer and typewriter, nor
is he doing this kind of work in
the office here.
Among the Chippewa young
men of this village there are sev
eral stenographers, but none of
them seem to be able to secure
employment from the office.
The law of last May should be
invoked through some attorney to
compel its observance.
In a communication from Wash
ington THK TOMAHAWK'S corres
pondent says in substance this: I
have carefully examined the pro
vision contained in the Indian Ap
propriation Act relating to the
employment of Chippewas in fill
ing all permanent positions in the
Chippewa Indian Service where
the position is being paid from
tribal funds, and would advise
that the Department ruling, viz:
that an appointment can only be
made where there is an actual
vacancy not filled by transfer, and
where it is necessary to make a
new appointment, is not in accord
ance with the statute.
The law clearly provides for the
appointment of Chippewa Indians
to all the positions which the In
dians can fill particularly is this
true with reference to any posi
tion paid out of the $185,000 ap
propriated for the Chippewas
from their funds.
It may require a law suit to
cause the officials of the Depart
ments to fulfill the 'aw, although
the construction of the statute by
the Department officers is wrong,
and deprives the Chippewa Indians
of the very rights and privileges
which the law intended to confer
upon them.
Reply To Petition.
On the 22nd of last month a
petition was numerously signed by
many of the villagers here protest
ing against the assignment of $0,-
000 of the $10,000 that was ap
propriated under the provisions of
the Indiin Appropriation Act of
May 18, 1916, for the purpose of
building roads and making other
improvements upon the Chippewa
reservations of this state, to the
Fond du Lac reservation.
The petition, which was as fol
lows, was sent to Attorney Ballin
ger of Washington, D. to pre-
*Truth before Favor."

sent to the Commissioner of In
dian Affairs:
"White Earth, Minnesota,
August 23, 1916.
Hon. Commissioner
of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
The undersigned members of
the White Earth Reservation in
Minnesota, are informed that from
the funds appropriated by the In
dian Appropriation Act of May
18, 1916, for the purpose of furn
ishing employment to the Chippe
was in "building roads and mak
ing other improvements upon
Chippewa reservations in Minne
sota for the benefit of the said
Chippewas," six thousand dollars
have been assigned to the ceded
Fond do Lac reservation.
The ceded Fond du Lac reser
vation ceased to be a reservation
under the Act of January 14, 1889,
entitled "An Act for the relief
and civilization of the Chippewa
Indians in the State of Minnesota",
and to now build any roads there,
or make any other improvements,
would be contrary to the provis
ions of the appropriation act re
ferred to.
It is also inconsistant to expend
six thousand out of ten thousand
dollars upon a reservation where
less than five hundred of six or
seven hundred members thereof
are living, and to assign to the
White Earth reservation only one
thousand dollars from ten thousand
dollars, and where more than six
thousand Chippewas reside, or
more than half of all the Chippe-
wa** Jti Minnesota.
Six thousand dollars at least
should be assigned to improving

the roads upon the White Earth
reservation, and the balance to the
Red Lake reservation, as these are
the only Chippewa reservations
now in the State, all the others
having been ceded under the act
referred to, and we respectfully
request that this be done."
Mr. Ballinger, in a communici
tion giving the information he re
ceived from the Indian office reia
tive to the matter, states that
some "members of Congress rec
ommended that $6,000 of the ap
propriation of $10,000 be expend
ed at the Fond du Lac reserva
tion, and in justification stated
that the white settlers upon that
reservation had constructed good
roads, and that in order to com
plete the roads it was necessary to
improve the connecting links run
ning through the land allotted to
the Indians, and that it would
take $6,000 do do this. They ex
plained that it was mainly for the
purpose of completing the road-*
on the Fond du Lac reservation
that the appropriation was made.
Acting Commissioner of Indian
Affairs Merrilt explained that the
$6,000 would complete the con
struction of roads on the Fond du
Lac reseivation, and that it was
the desire of the Indian office to
carry out the recommendations of
the members of Congress, partic
ularly when they were in line with
sound public policy, that it would
be useless to scatter the appropri
ation.
While he was in the Indian
office, Mr. Ballinger explains, Mr.
Merritt gave directions that the
remaining $4,000 of the $fO,0tJ0
appropriated should be expended
upon this reservation, but en in-
his store is something more than just a place where goods are for sale.
We aim to mike it render a real service in the community, through the
handling of reliable goods only, a strict guarantee on everything sold, low
prices and kindly, courteous treatment.

vestigation it was found that this
$4,000 had ah ea-iy been allotted,
only one thousand of which comes
to this reservation and that the
superintendent had already been
notified of the seperate assign
ments of the amount.
If the members of this and the
Red Lake reservations desire to
raise the issue, it seems that they
must now appeal either to the
Secretary of the Interior, or Uni
ted States courts.
The amendment which provides
for the appropriation of $10,000
was drawn by the Chippewa dele
gation that was at Washington
when tli3 Indian bill was before
the senate Indian committee, and
they deemed that they had safe
guarded the expenditure of the
amount of the appropriation by
specifically stating reservations,
and leaving out the words "ceded
reservations", which are usually
applied to ceded reservations and
which have ceased to be reserva
tions since the government opened
them to settlement.
The Opposition To The
Right Of Nomination
Bill.
There was more or less criticism
made last winter at Washington
by the Indian delegations that
were there on account of the tele
gram sent by Rev .Coolidge, presi
dent of the Society of American
Indians, to the chairman o the
senate committee on Indian affairs
