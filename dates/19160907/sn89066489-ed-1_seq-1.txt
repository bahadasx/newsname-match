CITES LEGISLATIVE RECORD
AS VINDICATING ADMINISTRATION.
"I Am the Candidate of the Party,
but I Am Above All Else
An American Citizen,"
Says President.
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 2.
President Wilson formally accept
ed his renomination here this af
ternoon with an address recount-;
ing the legislative record of the
democratic party, a vigorous de
fense of, his Mexican policy, his
dealings with the European bel
ligerents and an outline of his
view or America's obligations for
the future.
' With the members of the notifi
cation committee headed by Sen
ator James grouped about him at
Shadow Lawn, the summer white
house, the president declared the
republican) party was "just the
party that cannot meet the new
conditions of a new age" and that
the day of little Americanism
when "methods of 'protection
and industrial nursing were the
chief study of our provincia
', statesmen" was past and gone.
' We can no longer indulge our
traditional provincialism," said
the president. "We are to play
a leading part in the world drama
whether we wish it or not. We
shall lend not borrow ; act for
ourselves," not imitate or follow ;
organize and initiate, not peep
about merely to see where we may
get in."
Speaking of his diplomatic ne
gotiations with the European
belligerents, the president fol
lowed a declaration that while
property rights might be vindi
cated by claims for damages, the
loss of life and the fundamental
rights of humanity never could be
with this statements
The record is clear and con
sistent throughout andstands
distinct, and definite for anyone
to judge who wishes to know the
truth about it. -
Immediately afterward he said :
I am the candidate of a party,
but I am above all things else an
American citizen. I. neither seek
the favor nor fear the displeas
ure- of that small alien element
amongst us which puts loyalty to
any foreign power before loyalty
to the United States."
Regarding his Mexican . policy,
the president reiterated that , the
people of Mexico were struggling
"blindly it may be and as yet
ineffectually" to free themselves
from alien interests, "some of
them Americans pressing for
things they could never have got
in their own country," and that he
would do everything in his power
to prevent anyone standing in
their way.
tion." Then, later he said ; "We
have in four years come very near
to carrying out the platform of the
progressive party as well as our
own, for we are also progres
sives.
ON THE WING.
"It is hard doctrine," said he,
"only for those who wish to get
something for themselves out of
Mexico. " At another point the
president said :
"Mistakes I have no doubt
made in this perplexing business,
but not in purpose or object.'-'
He declared at another point:
"I am more interested in the
fortunes of oppressed men and
pitiful women and children than
in any property rights whatever. "
At the outset of his reference
to the legislative, achievements of
his party the president enumerat
ed the laws placed on the statute
books relating to business, includ
ing tariff revision, anti-trust laws,
revision of the banking and cur
, rency system, rural credits, re
habilitation of the merchant ma
rine and creation of. the federal
trade commission.
"What other party has under
stood the task so well or execut
ed it so intelligently and ener
getically t" he. asked. "What
other party has attempted it at
all! The republican leaders ap
parently know of no means of as-

How to.stimulate it and put it up
on -a new footing of energy and

of the party record fthe president
declared:
"This' ' extraordinary recital
must sound like a platform, a list

It is record of promises made
four years ago and now actually
redeemed in constructive legisla-

His name is Weever. This ram's
half brother sold to a Wisconsin

in the expenses.
