E. T. Bedford

Family Dines in Mansion
on Sound-Loss Estimated
in Vicinity of $1,Q00, All
in Jewelry.
The handsome summer home of E.
T. Bedford, millionaire banker was
robbed in a mysterious manner last
night. ,
Though Bridgeport city and private
detectives have been called into the
case they claimed at 2 o'clock this
afternoon to be 'baffled by the situa
tion.
As far as can be learned, the rob
bery which occurred Jn upper bedr
rodms of the great mansion, was per
petrated probably about 7 o'clock
when the Bedford family were seated
at dinner.
The loss is a considerable quantity
of Jewelry, variously estimated at from
$900 to $2,000 filched from pri
vate receptacles in the room. No in
dication of the manner of entrance
have been found. '
The property which is surrounded
by, spacious lawns and beautiful gar
dens on the shore road at Greens
Farms is particularly protected against
the encroachment of thieves and It is
wondered how entrance could be ef
fected over a porch, as is surmised
today, without the thieves being seen.
Among the Jewelry taken is a watch
valued at about $500 and other Jewel
ry, a list of which has not yet been
furnished the police.

If the carmen can carry out their
threats to halt surface as well as sub
way and elevated traffic. New .York'
faces the higgest and most vital strike
in its history. The geoprahpical for
mation of Manhattan Island long!
and narrow the wide distribution of
population pf the greater city and
the concentration of the business,
make New York peculiarly susceptible
to any interruption of street c -- ser
vice. . , ' j
The first test of the strike declared j
last night by the union employes ol j
the elevated and subway railways j
came with the morning -rush hours on ;
the main arteries ofy travel between,
the two ends of Manhattan Island.
When theworkers of the city start-:
ed for their, places of employment to-''
day, the Amalgamated Association of
Street & Railwayv Electric Employes,
Which is conducting the strike, had
been unable to tie up the subway and
elevatedJJnes but had succeeded in
crippling some of the most Important
surface lines.
.With the aid of nearly $.000 strike- .
breakers and under police protection,
the Interbjorough Rapid ' Transit Co.
was running its subway! and "L." trains t "
almost on nominal schedules. The strike j
of the Interborough employes has ,
spread, however, to the carmen of tho j
New York Railways Co., which oper
ates all but two of the important j
surface lines in the boroughs of Man-,
hattan and the Bronx. Linos In
Broadway, In the system of the Bifook- :
lyn Rapid Transit Co., are thus far at ;
peace. ' '
Approximately 18,000 employes are
affected. The immediate cause of the
strike is the refusal of the Interbor
ough Co. to release the men from an
agreement to seek no further improve
ment in working conditions for a pe
riod of two years alter the advancs
in pay which the men received last'
month. Behind these demands, how
ever, is a contest over the unionization
of the Street car workers of the city,
among whom the Amalgamated asao-;
ciutlon has- gained n. strong footing'
only during the last few months.
The union employes of the Inter--borough
Co. voted toi strike at 9:30'
o'clock last night and several thousand : x
union men immediately scattered
through the city to win over all street
car employes to their cause. Little
effect from the strike was noticeable,
during the Bight. One elevated train
was pelted with bricks, the passenger!
were taken off and the train sent back
empty to the terminal with a feirf
broken windows. About midnight sev
eral hundred men, many of whom
wore the union button, crowded, into ,
the subway at the Grand Central rail
road station and induced all the ticket' ,
choppers and platform guards to leave
their Jobs. The company quickly flll
ed their places.
In response to the railway company's
appeal for protection, 6,000 policemen
were released from patrol duty today
and made available for strike duty.
Two or three patrolmen were placed
on guard at every subway and elevated
station and two rode on every train.
For the protection of motormen heavy ,
wire screens were nailed to the ex
posed sides of the car vestibules.
The traction chiefs . declared that
they could malntai service on the ,
subway and elevated lines hut ex
pressed fear that -police protection
would not be adequate to enable them
to keep the regular number of sur- .
face cars running. As a precaution all
