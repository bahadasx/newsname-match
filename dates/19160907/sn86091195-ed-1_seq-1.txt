SUGAR STOCK
Ogden, Sejit. 2.—The entrance of a
new and independent company into the
Utah and Idaho sugar field with a eap
CLdization of $2,000,000 was announced
here today with the filing of articles
of incorporation for the Eccles Sugar
company of Ogden. The advent of this
new corporation into the beet sugar in
dustry is said to be significant for the
reason that stockholders have declared
it will compete with companies already
in the field, as well as with any that
may be recognized in the future.
With but two exceptions, the incor
porators of the new company are Og
den capitalists. They are Mrs. Bertha
M. Eccles, of Ogden, widow of the late
financier; Joseph M. Eccles, G. L. Beck
er, Ezra C. Rich, Joseph Scrowcroft,
Jr., Lawrence T. Dec, A. S. Patterson,
J. H. DeVine, T. W. Shelley and S. J.
Rich. Mr. Shelley is prominent resi
dent of Shelley, Idaho, and S. J. Rich is
a resident of Blackfoot, Idaho.
The $2,000,000 worth of stock of the
new company is held largely in trust
by Joseph M. Eccles, son of the late
David Eccles. Each of the stockholders
named as incorporators holds ten shares
of stock at the par value of $100 per
share and Mr. Eccles holds 1400 as
trustee. The articles name Mrs. Eccles
as president and general manager of
the company; G. L. Becker, vice presi
dent; Lawrence T. Dee, treasurer, and
H. M. Mon son, secretary.
All of those identified with the new
sugar company are more or less con
nected with the sugar industry through
the Amalgamated Sugar Company. Mrs.
Eccles is one of the heaviest stockhold
ers in the local company through her
interests in the David Eccles estate. L.
R. Eccles, her son, is general manager
of the Amalgamated Sugar Company.
Joseph Oerowcroft, Jr. another stock
holder in the new corporation, is the
eldest son of Joseph Scrowcroft, vice
president of the Amalgamated Sugar
company.
Several of those named incorpora
tors in the new concern stated tonight
that plans of operation have not pro
ceeded sufficiently to make public def
inite information, except that the com
pany will carry on its operations in the
Utah and Idaho field. The number of
sugar factories which it is proposed to
build and their location could not be
announced at this time, the stockholders
declared.
The announcement of the new- com
pany entering the field came as a dis
tinct surprise in this city.

PATIENCE A VIRTURE OF UNCLE SAM?
Partial Primary

Election day passed off very quietly
last Tuesday when a very few outside
of candidates and their personal friends

terest in its outcome. No one seemed
to be interested in the State ticket

behalf and succeeded in getting a small
majority vote. Yesterday afternoon

had opposition and were successful are:

That was the way partial returns
from the state-wide primary outlined
the Republican state ticket for the
November elections at 3 a. m. Wed
nesday.
Complete returns from 146 out of the
742 precincts of the state just before
3 a. m. gave D. W. Davis of American
Falls a total first choice vote of 5398.
Captain E. G. Davis of Boise, was next
with 3043, George Crum a close third
with 2630, and Herman II. Taylor 4tli
with 2101.
These returns included 22 precincts
of Ada county, and scattering return
from 21 other counties of the state.
J
For Republican candidate for con
gress Representative Addison T. Smith
and ex-Congressman Burton L. French
were in the lead, with complete returns
in from 21 counties, the former having
6850 votes and the latter 59.'i9. Con
gressman AI e( 'rucken had 4416 and E. E.
Elliott, of Bonners Ferry hud polled

490Douglas Smith a running third
with iw6 and Carlton Fox of Wallace

of a reiiomiuation for that office, Erv.
Johnson, liis closest, competitor, having
667, while Chaneey Wallace had but
.119.
John W. Eagleson, state treasurer
also seemed sure of renomination, with
1378 votes against the 808 polled by
Fred E. Fisk of Parma.
George W. Lewis had a lend of about
150 at midnight for the nomination for
state auditor. He had 792 votes, and

for Patch.
The race for state superintendent of
public instruction stood close, Aliss
Catherine T. Bryden having 1089 votes
against 944 for Aliss Ethel E. Redficld.
Scattered returns gave John C. Rice
the lead for justice of the supreme
court with 1455; Robert N. Dunn hud
12116, and judge I. N. Sullivan was
third with 'll97.
In many places the state vote of the
Democrats had not been counted, for
lack of contests in all save two places
made the nomination of the Democratic
ticket a foregone conclusion. James II.
Frazier and Ernest L. Parket were both
candidates for the Democratic nomina
tion for lieutenant governor, and Joseph
Hansen and William T. Dougherty were
competing for the Bourbon nomination
for secretary of state.
A FATHER'S COMPLAINT
Editor Optimist:
Dear Sir:
I have read in your last week 's issue
the article entitled, ''A Mother's Piti
hle Plight," and believe it unfair and
unjust. You know that I cannot pub
lish the facts in the matter, hence it
is unfair. I was in the sheriff's office
when you interviewed the woman in the
case, but you did not give me a chance
to give you even a glimpse of the other
side, hence it is unfair.
I will not publish the facts, but 1
will say this: The boy referred to as
a husband is at least two years young
er than the woman mentioned as moth
er.
I, myself, investigated the matter
at the proper time and decided that
under the circumstances I would not
use coercion in the matter. After due
deliberation I came to the conclusion in
the affair, and I believe time has prov
en my deductions to be correct. I be
lieve, too, that any sensible man, know
ing the facts, would have acted as I
have.
Wm. Anthony,
Wapello, Idaho.
The board of county commissioners
meet tomorrow to sell county bonds
and will meet again Monday to can
J vass the primary returns. -

CITY LIBRARY
IS FLOURISHING
The City Library will be open from
3 until 5:30 Friday afternoon. The
Story Telling Lady will not begin the
story until 4:15 so as to accomodate
the children in school. Last week it
was the pleasure of the writer to watch
the dramatization of one of the stories.
To an onlooker at first it all seemed
erdue, but as the children burst into
spontaneous action we felt the free
expression which unconsciously they
were developing. They had grasped
ideas. In about fifteen minutes they
staged a three act play, in their own
way. In every story is an underlying
truth that may influence many a little
life in after years—to noble deeds—
The story of Cedric and The Knights
was told last week and will be drama
tized this week with the folowing char
acters:
Cedric ........................
Sir Ronalds Dubois
Cedric's Mother ....
Cedric's Wife .......
Cedric 's Children....
........Jay Afitchell
........John DeHart
........Juania Boyle
.Tlirese Simmons
..Elizabeth Christ
Rosemary Cowan, Alark Jorgensen.
The Knights ................................Ten Boys
The King ........................ Leland Beakley
The Queen ..............................Aliss Reece
The Story teller when interviewed
said, "too much importance cannot be
placed upon the value, and influence
of stories in developing the human race.
From time immemorial myths and tradi
tions have been handed down from one
generation to another. Character is
built upon such influences ns Art, Afusie
and Literature. The reason we drama
tize these stories is two fold: First
we wish to leave the impression, we
want each child to grasp the salient
idea we were trying to express of honor,
bravery, patience, truth, etc. Secondly
in acting out the story the child ex
presses himself truthfully. This is our
greatest aim.
PLEASANT OLD FOLKS' DAY
The program of the old Folks' day
comeneed Saturday morning at 11:00
o'clock when the Second Ward meeting
house was filled to overflowing. Tho
first number on the program was a song

by a prayer by Elder Jensen of Grove
laud. Then Bishou Buchanan intro
duced the Hon. Peter G. Johnston who
made a brief euology on tlie old folks.
He was followed by the father of Law
yer Thomas who entertained tlie meet
ing with witjy remarks and his
good jokes ware greatly appreciated.
John Bond, Sr., then delighted the audi

his own composition entitled ,"Afy
Own Dear Loving Alother." P. G.
Johnston then recited the old familiar
and truthful poem, "A Mon's a Mon

then spread and enjoyed by nil present.
After lunch many of the Old Folks
indulged in a joy ride, the autos for
which were donated for the occasion
Those who failed to get auto accomoda
tions adjourned to the Orpheum theatre
where they spout the afternoon watch
ing the pictures which they seemed to
enjoy very much. The theatre was free
ami the house was taxed to its utmost.
President Duckworth also addressed the
venerable audience and told them a story
of Robert Ingersoll and Henry Ward
Beecher which received much applause.
