1 1 COiNTROVERSV
HAS BEEN SETTLED
Tbis Article Was Written So You
Uudentand How it Start
ed And Ended
The four Brotherhoods of rail
road trainmen presented their
demands six months ago to the
railroad companies for an eight
hour basis working day, and
other radical changes in some
working conditions.
When these demands were
presented, the railroads refused
them entirely.
The Brotherhood chiefs then
submitted to their men whether
or not to call a strike, and more
than three-foutths of them vot
ed for it. Then the railroads
propped to srbitnte sll po nh
including the eight hour day.
The men agreed to arb trate

And why? HtvauM?, an thty
ai'i, nd it in aomiiteJ. three
otirths of th? trainman already
wo'k cn the cikht hour bufia.
(and a number of railroads apply
t-.? e'cht hcur djv 'o h train
service. On all railroads, eight
hojrs is the basic day for all
through passenger and freight
traffic, and covers three fourths
of the trainmen. The ten hour
day applies only to local freight
and passenger crews.
In rejecting the proposal to ar
bitrate, the trainmen asked this
question, "why jeopardize a pri
vilige that three fourths of our
men already possess for a chance
j to gain pof sibly the same advan
tage for the other one fourth?"
When the oppofirg forces were
unable to compose their differ
ence the president intervened in
behalf of the whole people of the
nation who would be the inno
cent but awful Bufferera of the
strike-one of the gnat'est cal
amities that could befall us.
After patently hearing both
sides the president discovered
that the differences were relat
ively small-the brotherhoods
were asking for one fourth of
the trainmen the same privilege
the eight hour day-which the
other three fourths were enjoy
ing. He suggested as a remedy
that the railroads tentatively
grant the demand in order to
have a through trial of it. He
promised to appoint a committee
of experienced men to observe
the workings of it, and report
the results to congress. In this
way it coulibest br. determined
as the president argued, whether
it was right or wrong and wheth
er operating expenses would be
increased, and whether a raise
in traffic rates would be necess
ary. In any event Congress
could provide the remedy.
When it is recalled that the
platforms of all parties. Demo
crats, Republican and Progress
ive have expressly approved the
eight hour day in principle, and
have enacted into law provisions
placing all government work on
that basis, and v. hen it is furth
er rem mbered that all through
tram service has for quite a
while been upon that basis, it
v.iil readily be appreciated that
the president tiuly said that the
best public sentiment and mat
ure thought favored it. When
the just proposals of the presi
dent were rejecteJ by the rail-
ro;d, it remained for Congress
alone, to avert the calamity.
Unless Congress acted prcmpt
ly and effectively, the strike
wh'ch had already been called
meant the complete tie up of all
EIGHT-HOUR DAY

To illustrate, when Roosevelt out the entire session,
stood sponsor for Taft in 1908 The Association was called to
and had him nominated, the order at the appointed hour, by
Republican Platform expressed Moderator, Bro. H. F. Green:
great pride in "The wise policy great enthusiasm was manifest
whieh has induced the Republi- el frm the bpginnine and a
can partyU rr.atain proection to
American- labor, to establish the
eight hour day in the construc
tion of all public work."

Roosevelt led the great remit, iCro of Lioc.d Ri;r As-.n.-inf .
the republican platforr
t-ianj. ... n as
etrangely silent on the labor
question, but the progressive
platform was pronounced in its
advocacy of the Eight hour day.
Djring the Wilson odministr
atkn laws have been passed by
congress placing all government
work on the eight hour base?,
and the present Republican plat
form upon which Mr. Hughes is
running approves those laws by
laying we pledge th Republican
Party to the faithful enforce
ment of all Federal laws passed
for the protection of labor.
The Republican Party in elec
tion time? has always been pro
fuse in platform promises of
progressive legislation. The
strength of the Wilson adminis
tration consists in a recard of
platform pledges redeemed by
laws enacted to put them into
practice. The Republicans do
not and can not assail them. As
to seme of them then can only
say, "we suggested them."
The pity is that they would do
no more. It took Wilson to put
them on the statute book.

The road to a man's heart is

the railroads. All passenger ser
vice would end and all manufact
aries and mir.en would have to
suspend for lack of fuel, mater
ial and market, and for the time
being the farmers with their
produce would be relegated to
the condition 100 years ago.
Congress met the conditions
and enacted into law the sugges
tions made by the president in
the first place to avert the strike.
Owing to the point of view of
the critic, both the railroads and
the trainmen are centured by the
public and it is said that congress
jielded to the trainmen under
duress; that in such haste Con
gress could not given calm con
sideration to such momentous
questions. But as said by the
New York World, "The rights
and wrongs of this controversy
are yet to be determined so far
as thev effect the rights of the
railroads and their employees, "

s?rmon was practical in every
point and was greatly enjoyed
by all who heard it.
The reports on the various
causes fostered by the Baptist
Denomination were read and
adopted; all of them were en
couraging and stand as proof
that the great work of helping
t. evangelize the world is being
carried forward by the Baptists
