Its STRUCK;SIR
IS. HE CATT
Great War Will Bring Untold
Change Declares
Suffrage Leader
(By Associated Press)
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Sept 7.?
The National American Woman Suffrage
Association yesterday, decided
to continue its policy of favoring both
national and state legislation to bring
about equal rights for women.
An amendment had been proposed to
confine the work of the organization
to the federal amendment ahd another
amendment proposed that the
asnociation confine its efforts to state
legislation. Both were defeated by an
overwhelming vote.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, presdlent
of the National American Woman's
Suffrage association, in her address before
the convention of the association
todftV nirtlirprl ihfi nilffroca mrtvamonf
as having reached a crisis which means
that "The Women's Hour Has Struck!"
Earnestly, she exhorted the women not
to lose heart but to recognize the present
opportunity which "if seized with
vigor, enthusiasm and will, means the
final victory of our great cause In
the very near future."
She said, in part:
"The great war will bring untold
changes In Its wake; it presages a
total change in the status of women
In Europe, from the Polar Circle to
the Aegean sea women have risen and
taken the places made vacant by men,
and in so doing they have grown In
self-respect and In the esteem of their
respective nations. In deed. Europe is
realizing as it never did before, that
women are holding together the civilization
for which men are fighting. A
great searchlight has been thrown
upon the business of nation-building
and it has been demonstrated in every
European land that it Is a partnership
wtih equal but different responsibilities
resting upon the two
partners.
"The war will soon end and the
armies will return to their native lands
To many a family, the men will never
come back. The husband who returns
to many a wife will eat no bread the
rest of his life save of her earning.
"What then will happen after the
war? Will the widows left with families
to support cheerfully leave their
well-paid posts for those commanding
lower wages? Not without protest!
The economic axiom, denied
and evaded for centuries will be embalzoned
on every factory, counting
house and shop; 'equal pay for equal
work; and common justice will slowly
but surely enforce that law. The European
woman has arisen. She may
not realize it yet but the woman 'doormat'
in every land has unconsciously
become a 'door-jamb.' She will have
become accustomed to her new dignity
by the time the men come home. She

men in this kind of business and has
had much experience in grocery merchandising.
The stockholders of the new Co-operative
association in addition to the six
per cent, dividend paid on the stock
invested In the store will every three
months receive a share of the net profits
of the store. These net profits will
be apportioned among each member
of the company regardless of the number
of shares they hold estimated according
to the amount of their purchases
at the store.

as legal advisor and attorney for the
association and will attend to all legal
details of the transfer of stock from
Purdy and the various contracts with
the manager and employees.
The new store location at Virginia
. avenue and Tenth street Is admirably
situated for the accommodation of a
large number of the stockholders of
the association and when this store Is
thoroughly organized and in efficient
operation the directors are planning to
open another branch store probably
down town for the accommodation of
the railroad employees and laboring
men who live at a distance from the
present store.

TRAINS RUNNING
IN NEWJQRK CITY
New Traction Strike Does
Not Start Auspiciously
For the Men
(By Associated Press)
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.?A million
or more residents ot New York left
their homes this morning not knowing
whether they would ride to walk
or work. The first test of the strike
declared last night by union employees
of the elevated and subway railways
came with the morning rush
hours on main arteries of travel between
the two ends of Manhattan island.
When the workers of the ctiy started
for placeB ot employment the amalgamated
association of street and
electric railway employees which is
conducting the striki had been unable
to tie up the subway and elevated
lines but had succeeded in crippling
some of the most important
surface lines.
With the aid ot nearly 3,000 strike
breakers and under police protection
the Interborough Rapid Transit company
was running its trains on subway
and L almost on normal schedule.
The strike of the Interborough
employees has spread however to the
carmen of the New York railway
company which operates all but two
of th4 important surface lines in the
boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx
Lines in the Brooklyn system rf the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit company are
thus far at peace.
Annrnvlmfltolv 1fi Ann man av. affanf
ed. Tbe Immediate cause of the strike
Is refusal of the Interborough company
to release the men from an agreement
to seek no further improvements in
working conditions for a period of two
years after the advance in pay which
the men received last month. Behind
these demands is a contest over the
unionization of the street car workers
of the city among whom the amalgamated
association has gained strong
footing only during the last few
months.
Five thousand policemen were released
from patrol duty and made
available for strike duty. For the protection
of motormen heavy wire
screen were nailed to exposed sides
of the car vestibules. Several instances
of elevated trains being bombarded
with stones and bottles thrown
from roofs were reported to the police
shortly before nine o'clock. Reserves
were rushed to the scene of disorder!

The preventive measures taken toy
the City Board of Health for the pre- <
vention of a spread of the Infantile i

enforcement at every place In the |
city. So far no flagrant violations I
have been met with and the persons
moat affected by the regulations are j

the measures. 1
Moving picture shows and theatres 1

proprietors of these places were In- i
cllned to oppose the enforcement of j
the rules until they were brought to
see the necessity for the regulations.
The county authorities acting un- .
der the advisement of the county
Board of Health yesterday evening .
prohibited a wagon show from performing
or stopping at Falrvlew, and '
a blanket order was issued prohibiting
all circuses from showing In this
county until further notice. Shows
of this nature from infected regions
are particularly dangerous means of
carrying the disease beacuse of the
flies that are attracted to the animals.
The Mannlngton schools will open
on schedule time next week according
to the present'announcement of
the school authorities at that place.
The Fairmont High school opening is
postponed, as It is under the order
embracing the city schools and many .
of the students are below the age 11mit
