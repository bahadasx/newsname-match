Washington, Sept. 6. Sweeping
demands far more drastic than any
published summaries have indicated,
are revealed in the secret terms being
pressed on China by Japan as a re
sult of tho recent armed conflict be
tween soldiers of the two nations at
Cheng Chiatum, inner Mongplia. Pri
vate dispatches received here today
reveal that Japan seeks indemnities,
an apology and political concessions
through the whole section of inner
Mongolia and south Manchuria.
U. S. INTERESTS INVOLVED.
Secretary Lansing refused tonight
to comment on the dispatches. It is
known that steps will be taken by the
state department to secure detailed
reports. American interests seem at
first glance to be more deeply invol
ved than in any event in the far East
since Japan's famous ultimatum to
China of May, 1915.

Chickens Being Slaughtered
In The Fox Poultry
Plant.
40,000 IN THE PENS NOW
Busiest Place In The City
With Pay Roll of $500
a Day.
Tho busiest place in town just now
is the poultry packing plant of the
Fox Bros. Co., where 40,000 young
chickens are being put on the market.
Their broiler season opened two
.weeks ago and after two weeks of
milk feeding they have begun
slaughtering the fowls for the east
ern market. Coops in which the
chicks arc fattened arc piled one
above another in tiers, with feeding
troughs, on long aisles. The fat
chickens are removed from these
coops and the coops filled with others
from the pens. The pens in turn are
filled from caates on cars waiting to
be unloaded. The company now has
5,000 ready to pack, 25,000 awaiting
slaughter and 10,000 not yet unloaded.
The chickens are bled to death
without cutting off the heads or
opening the carcasses. The feathers
are removed, the heads wrapped in
paper and after hanging in the cold
storage room until ready for ship
ment they are packed in cars and
sent east. The Fox brothers expect
to handle 150,000 chicks within the
next 60 days and then the season for
old stock will open.
They now have 50 pickers and
want 150 more. They pay 21 cents
per fowl and many of the- women
make $2 a day. Their pay roll in
the busy season is $500 a day.
They are already planning for an
ad iition to double the capacity of the
plant and expect to start work about
Nov. 15th. It will fill the lot be
tween the present building and First
street.

istration emergency revenue bill, de

at the end of the war and giving the
president authority to take drastic re
taliatory steps against allied interfer
ence with American trade, was
passed late tonight by the senate.
The vote was 42 to 16.
ALLIED DIPLOMATS ALARMED.
Drastic amendments to the revenue
bill, striking at the allied blacklist and
British interference with American
mails, were adopted by the senate
and created consternation among the
diplomatic representatives of the al
lies.
In allied quarters it was declared
that the enactment of the amendments
into the law would constitute nothing
less than a non-intercourse act,' pre
liminary to a commercial warfare
with possibilities of far-reaching con
sequences.
TRADE REPRISALS AGREED
UPON.
Amendments designed to provid
means of retaliation against Great
Britain for embargoes on American
goods, the trade blacklist and inter
ference with the mails, were agreed
to without roll call.
Employment of the land and naval
forces of the United States to enforce
retaliatory measures and to prohibit
importations of goods into the United
States from nations which prohibit the
importation into their own or into any
other country, dependency or colony
of any article the product of the soil
or industry of the United States and
not injurious to health or morals
is
provided in one of the amendments
Inasmuch as the government has
decided on a course of legislation to
meet the restraints upon commerce
with diplomatic correspondence has
been unable to remove it is gener
ally expected the amendments will be
put through.
The administration leaders who
have intimate connection with the
government's foreign policy made no
attempt to stay their adoption.
WITHHOLD CLEARANCE FROM
An amendment to the revenue bill,
authorizing the president during
war in which the United States is not
engaged, to withhold clearance from
all vessels which discriminate against
American shippers; to withhold privi
leges from ships of such nations as
withhold privileges accorded to other
nations from American ships, and' to
use the army and navy, if necessary,
to prevent departure of offending
vessels from United States ports, was
adopted today by the senate.

Comes From Pressure.
Lexington, Ky., Sept. 0. Charles

that filled the auditorium here Tues
day condemned "legislation in ad-
vanco of investigation" and declared
that the United States "had gone very
far toward the day when we shall
have action under pressure, instead

fer by name to the Adamson law but

it.

teeman from Kentucky. Previous to
the arrival of the republican presiden
tial candidate, a meeting of former
progressives was held at which reso
lutions giving all their support to Mr.
