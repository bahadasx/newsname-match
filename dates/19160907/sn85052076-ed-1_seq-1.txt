A Month From Now!
A month from now hundreds of young folks will be
glad they started for Berea in September.
An Eight Hour Day
It looks as though the railroad men would get an
eight hour day. There are two questions to ask: First,
can the rest of us, who all patronize the railroads for
freight and travel, afford to give them ten hours pay for
eight hours work? We hope we can. We hope ma
chinery has made work so light that all who work in shops
and mines can do their share and support their dear ones
by eight hours of good work a day. Of course the man
who works for himself, and has varied outdoor work like
the farmer, will work longer. But for the tied-up man
shut in to a monotonous task the ideal certainly is "Eight
hours for sleep, and eight for work, and eight for what
we will."
But the second question is, what will the men do
with that extra two hours of idle time? Will it mean gar
dens, books, the higher pleasures of home and school
and church?
Irish Tactics of the Suffragists
For many years the Irish in the British Parliament
have voted only to promote their own ambition. When
things were evenly balanced between the two great par
ties they would say, "Do this thing for Ireland and we
will vote for you." In this way they have hindered the
progress of the nation, and secured things, some good
and some bad, for Ireland. tJtzg& j
Just so in this close election, the suffragists, claim
ing to control the votes of women in some western states,
have bulldozed both the Republican and Democrat par
ties into making insincere pledges for woman suffrage.
Neither Wilson nor Hughes believes that "votes for wo
men" will benefit either the women or the country, but
both submit just now to the bulldozing. Before lonp, the
womanly women, queens of our millions of happy homes,
will bring their influence to bear, and our nervous sisters
with the yellow suffrage badges go where the free silver
agitators have gone.

OPENING OP FALL TERM
The Institution workers are
gathering back, and their annual
"Convocation" will be held Friday

BEREA 3 STRAIN
Berea has the 'money provided for
Talcolt Hail, but Kentucky Hall is
only about half provided for, and
the great improvement at Ladies
Hall and other places are being made
largely on faith. The Institution
has seldom been under greater
financial strain.

The passage by Congress of a law
making eight hours the legal work

of great importance. It has stopped

That There May Be No Question aa
to Legality of tha Measure Being
Signed on Sunday, President Will
Again Affix Name to Bill.
Washington, Sept 4. Without cere
mony the Adamson eight hour bill,
which resulted In an order from the
brotherhood leaders calling off tha
nation wide strike aet for today, was
signed by President Wilson in his
private car at the union atatloa, where
ho etopped on his way from Shadow
Lwn, N. J, to Hodgenvllle, Ky.
That there may ba no question as
to tha legality of the measura aa a
result of It having been signed oa
Sunday, tho president will affix his
signature again upon his return to
Washington next Tueiday.
How long peace shall reign aa a
result of tha bill apparently la depend
ent upon developments in the pro
posed more to test the constitutional
ity of the act Should tha railroads
take no action, but await tho begin
ning of an Investigation of the work
ings of tha eight hour-day bill by tha
aeclal commission for which the meas
ure provldea, the brotherhoods will re
main Inactive. Tha employes, leaders
declare, however, that should the law
bo held unconstitutional and the rail
roads attempt to restore the tea-hour
day on their lines, a strike will follow
promptly.
Brotherhood heads In a circular let
ter to their members made no com
ment on the meaaure as passed. They
merely pointed out that it would not
become effective until next Jan. 1, and
that many things might occur be
tween now and then which would
change materially any suggestions or
comment they might make.
None of the Brotherhood leaders
witnessed the signing of the bill. They
had expected, according to tentative
arrangements made by Secretary Wit-
son, to be present, but the president
decided to attend to tha business at
the railroad station, and newspaper
correspondents gave them their flrst
Information about It. Tha four pens
used by the president signing the bill,
one for each syllable of his name
will ba presented to the four brother
hood heads. A. B. Garretson, W. Q.
Lea, W. 8. Carter and W. 8. Stone,
after being used for re-slgnlng the
bill on Tuesday.
The bill that stopped tha strike pro
vides that after Jan. 1, 1817, eight
hours shall ba regarded aa a basis of
reckoning for a day's pay of men en
gaged In the operation of railroad
trains In Interstate commerce -
eeptlng roads less than 100 miles long
and electrlo lines that they shall re
celre pro rata pay for work in excess
of eight hours, and that tbelr rate of
compensation shall not be changed
pending an liwestlxatlon for from six
to nine months of tha effect of the
eight-hour day upon the railroads by
a commission to oa appointed by tha
president.
Efforts to amend tha bill In tha sen
ata were futile, tha supreme effort to
altar It having been led by Senator
Underwood, who sought to provide
that tha Interstate commerce commia-
sloa should have power to fix railroad
wsgaa and hours of aervtce In tha
future.
WORLD HEWS
The week has marked little change
on either frontier of the European
War. The Russians are reported
to be closer to Lemburg. The cam
paign against Verdun is coming to
be regarded as a failure. Italy has
engaged in hard fighting against the
Austrians in the region of the Tren-tino.
In the beginning of hostilities, the
Roumanians have scored a success.
They have crossed into Transyl
vania, a province of Austria- Hun
gary, have driven back the Aus
trians after a live days' fight and
have advanced quite a distance into
the province.
England's effort to cut off supplies
from Germany has led her to cap
ture about a hundred Dutch fishing
boats and bring them into English
and Scotch ports. It is true that the
German consumption, of Dutch fish
has greatly increased during the
war as that is almost the only source)
of supply.
Pope Benedict has protested against
the seizure of a famous old palace)
in Rome by the Italian government.
The palace was used by the Austri
an ambassador, aa it belonged to his
countrjr, having been acquired by
gift from Venice to whom it had
been given by the Pope. Italy's act
was defended on the ground that
Austria had been guilty of needless
destruction of old buildings in Venice.
The wonderful increase in tha
gold supply of the United States, as
compared with Europe during the
two years of war, may be seen in the
statement that our country holds
within fifty million dollars of the
total amount held by the banks of
France, England, Russia and Ger
many. Before the war the banks of
the four leading European countries
held six hundred and eighty million
dollars more gold than the United
States.
