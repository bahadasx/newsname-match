GRAND FORKS, N. D„ THURSDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 7, 1916.
COMMITTEE MEET
Resolution to Permit Candi
dates to Address Body
Voted Down.
M'ARTHUR WAS ON
HAND TO SPEAK
Told the Committeemen to
Frame Platform, He'd
Have (me of His Own.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Bismarck, N. D., Sept. 7.—The old
fight in the Democratic party cropped
out again during Wednesday after
noon's session off the Democratic state
committee. A resolution to permit
the party, candidates to address the
meeting was proposed, and opposi
tion to it developed immediately.
After acrimonious discussion this
resolution was. voted down. The
features which caused even some of
the seasoned wariors of the party
to gasp a little, was the fact that D.
H. McArthur, Democratic nominee
for governor, was present in the
room while the resolution was be
ing debated, and he had come pre
pared to address the convention and
to make some suggestions as to the
platform.
Mr. McArthur was placed in a most
humiliating position, and he evidently
felt it.- He rose and delivered him
self of some remarks which might
have been construed as unparliament
ary, and which were certainly uncom
plimentary to some of his fellow
democrats. He denounced the atti
tude of those who had bluntly re
fused to give him, the gubernatorial
candidate of the party, a hearing, and
told the members that they might go
ahead and frame their own platform
as they pleased, and he would run on
a platform of his own.
The incident was another mani
festation of the friction which Demo
cracy, and in connection with which
a fight has been staged in every elec
tion year for some time back. In
this have been involved Mr. Mc
Arthur, Fred W. McLean, the newly
elected state chairman, John Burke,
United States treasurer, former gov
ernor, and now candidate for the
United States senate, John Bruegger,
former national, committeeman, and
Perry, of Ellendale, his successor,
with many others
While no one isi willing, to be quoted
on the~ subject, Democrats ex
plain the present situation on the
theory that the present plans have
been laid In the interest of John
Burke's campaign for the senate, and
there are suggestions of a quiet un
derstanding that McArthur is to be
sacrificed in the interest of Burke. In
other words, according to this gossip,
the influence of the Democratic state
organization is to be exerted quietly
for Frazter for governor in exchange
for Republican votes for Burke for
the senate. No representative Demo
crat is willing to be quoted in support
of this theory, and several deny in
dignantly that there is any such un
derstanding. Nevertheless, the rumor
is a matter of current conversation.
There is a very general feeling that
by permitting a personal disagree
ment to disrupt their organization in
this manner,, and to create breaches
which are not likely to be mended at
least during this camaign. the Demo
crats have thrown away a great op
portunity to take advantage of the di
vision which has existed in the arnks
of the Republicans. There are Demo
crats who believe that had the party
stood solidly together and made the
most of its opportunities it could have
elected its candidate for governor this
year. As It is, he would be an ex
ceedingly optimistic Democrat who
would expect that, under the present
conditions the party could elect any
body.
At the meeting of the committee,
the following officers were elected:
Chairman, F. W. McLean, Fargo sec
retary, W. E. Byerly, Velva treasurer,
J. M. Kelly, Devils Lake.
Resolutions.
At a special evening session held
downtown, resolutions were passed as
follows: Endorsement of the na
tional administration, platform and
candidates special endorsement of the
Adamson bill, compulsory hall insur
ance, an educational Institution west
of the Missouri river, a terminal ele
vator In the state, a two-cent passen
ger railway rate, and the Torrens' sys
tem of recording titles to property.
The committee went on record as
favoring co-operation among the
farmers for purposes of marketing
and flour milling, but did not declare
for state participation in these things.
Makes Statement.
Mr. McArthur was very much
aroused over the action of the com
mittee in denying him a hearing be
fore it.
In a brief statement for publication,
he said: "I had no axe to grind in ap
pearing before the committee. I
merely sought to promote the har
mony which is essential to success. If
the committee and the man whom the
voters of. the party have nominated
for governor are unable to work to
gether, success cannot be expected.
"I have done my part, and after the
action of the committee, I shall rec
ognize neither committee nor plat
form. I shall make my own campaign
and my own platform, and I shall tell
the people something about the men
whose chief activity in the past has
been to hold meetings and endorse
each other for office."

London, Sept. 7.—An interesting
story regarding Field Marshal von
Mackensen. who is understood to be in
control of all the Central Powers
armies in Southeastern Europe, is
told by Petroff. a well-known war
correspondent of the Russkoe Slovo.
German prisoners, he says, speak of
Mackensen as "the Archangel Mi
chael with a flaming sword, who put
the enemy to defeat in the Carpathi
ans."
When he assumed command of the
Austrian armies in the Carpathians he
began by proclaiming the whole Car
pathian district In a state of siege.
Next he requisitioned all horses from
the neighboring villages, registered all
the old men, women and even chil
dren over 12 years of age, and organ
ized them into working squads. New
roads were built and narrow-gauge
railways were constructed in all pass
es. The number of troops was
doubled. German enginering troops
were transported in great numbers
and set to working day and night. The
number of machine guns available'is
said to be something appalling. Von
Mackensen boasts, according to Pet
roff, that he Is going to strengthen the
Carpathians so they -will be as red
hot iron stairs to the advancing Rus
sians.
Petroff quotes statements made by
prisoners of war concerning two re
cent war councils held by Mackensen.
The first took place at Kovel, nine
teen Austrian generals of the highest
rank being present.
"At the opening of the sitting," says
Petroff, "Prince Leopold of Bavaria,
especially sent by the Kaiser, handed
to von Mackensen a letter from the
Kaiser. Von Mackensen rose to his
feet and began to read the important
document- Prince Leopold also stood
up. Von Mackensen read in silence,
becoming pensive, often frownjng. It
was evident that the letter contained
numerous questions, and that Prince
Leopold knew their order and char
acter. While von Mackensen was
reading Prince Leopold was actually,
as it were, counting every expression

angel. As he read von Mackensen
Sometimes paused to think over the
question dealt with in the letter, re
plying with determination and reso

uttered a resolute 'No.' Prince
Leopold marked these down.

paper in his hand until it burnt to

Prince Leopold, who evidently had
been waiting for some statement. But
Mackensen remained silent.
'Vou did not answer the last
question of the Emperor,' remarked
the Prince at last
'I did not,' slowly retorted Mack
ensen, frowning.
"It seemed that the Austrian gen
erals present knew what the question
was, for they all became anxiously at
tentive and regarded each other with
an air of distress. At last, pausing
at each syllable, the Field Marshal re
plied
'Because am too old. and be
cause I have my reputation as a sol

thing.'
"All sat quiet and depressed. Prince
Leopold grasped his throat is if it

generals, after a pause, asked with
what powers the Field Marshal had
been invested.
'General von Hindenburg and my
self,' answered Mackensen. 'are the
two hands of Emperor Wilhelm, and
our action is dictated solely by the
head of the Kaiser. We are not lim
ited in an£ other way.
"At the conclusion of the official
deliberations Mackensen frankly told
the Austrian generals it was in their
interests to obey the German general
staff.
'If you have failed to defend your
country from invasion.' said he. 'you
should at least obey those who have
already saved you.'
"When the Austrians had left,
Mackensen remarked of the Austrian
commanders:
'In the discussion of plans every
one of them is a Machlavelll, but
when it comes to the execution they
have but straw minds and hands of
clay.'
"At the second council of war
Mackensen acted as the complete
master- He frankly said a number of
the higher Austrian generals would be
removed from active service, as they
were not capable enough. Some of
the Austrian commanders asked if
there was any hope of clearing the
Russians from Austrian territory, as
had previously been done.
'Our Emperor,' answered Macken

"This Is not the only point in our favor," said a British staff officer.
"The Germans chose their ground when they built this line of forti
