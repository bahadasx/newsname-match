Even Newspaper Editors
Sometimes Get Peevish
The editor of an eastern paper has
grown peevish. He has been pestered
so much by people desiring free puffs
that he facetiously refers to himself
as the '"Peerless Prince of Puff Pur
veyors." He thinks that he has done
enough for social queens, folks who
are looking for free advertising, peo
ple who have legislative fads they
wish to push and organizations which
want free publicity. So he hasevolved
the following scale of prices for puffs:
For telling the public that a man is
a successful citizen when everybody
knows he is as lazy as a hired man,

SCHOOL HAPPENINGS
School will begin on Monday, Sept.
11th.
A slight change has been made in
the arrangement of the grades. The
second and third grades will be locat
ed in the Woodman Hall this year.
All others will coiue to the central
building.
A word in reference to beginners.
Al! boys and girls who are six years
old or will be before January the first
l!)17 may enter this fall. Pupils may
enter the iirst grade only once during
the year, namely at the opening of the
school in the fall. We wish all par
ents having Iirst year pupils would
write the name of the boy or girl and
the date of birth on a slip of paper
and send it or the day of entering
school.
As heretofore we shall have exemp
lions from monthly and linal examin
ations on the following conditions:
the pupil's class standing and de
portment must be ninety or above.
We believe this tends to produce bet
ter i-osuHs. Hoys, and girls,, lieghj
early and start the year right.
The new teachers for the coming
year are as follows: First grade, Miss
Meade second grade Miss Sehroeder
fourth and fifth grades, Miss Tollock
sixth grade, Miss Larson seventh
grade, Miss Reese music and draw
ing, Miss Morton domestic science,
Miss Hell: manuel training, Mr. Nor
ton Gray school, Miss McCullough
Washburn school, Miss Nystrom.
We all very much appreciate the re
pairs done at the school buildings
during the summer. We hope that all
pupils will take prideinkeepingthings
as neat as possible. It cost a great
amount of money to beautify your
surroundings and we trust you will
be considerate.
Here's looking forward for a good
year. Dig in and do your part to
make it the best Elope has ever ex
perienced.
The Country Schools
Before long the country schools will
have opened for the fall term. A
very large percentage of the children
living on the farms receive their en
tire school training in the local
school. Whatever the country school
has to offer may ba theirs. Whatever
it does not offer is beyond the reach
of most of them. It is evident that
the quality of the country school is a
matter of deep concern to the state
and nation.
Within recent years there has been
a great development of interest in the
rural school, and it is high time for
the subject to receive attention. Edu
cators all over the land are agreed
that in America, while progress has
been made in the work of graded and
high schools and in colleges, the work
in the rural schools has lagged sadly.
Some educators go so far as to say
that until the past few years the rural
school, taking the country over, has
made no progress whatever. Among
the things that are pointed out as
tending to impair the work of the rur
al schools are:
Poor buildings and poor surround
ings, and poor equipment.
Short terms.
Irregular attendance.
To frequent changes of teachers.
Inefficiency on the part of teachers.
Where these defects exist they are
related to each other, and to a multi
tude of others which might be enum
erated. How many of the rural schools
are defective in these and other ways
and what can be done to better themV

A PRETTY W WEDDING
Large Gathering of Friends and Relatives
Witness Happy Event Wednesday
Among the social events of our
city there has been none of more
prominence than the pretty
home wedding which occurred
yesterday afternoon at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. J. Fullmer,
when their daughter, Katie
was united in marriage to Mr.
Hilmar C. Krstad, of Spiritwood.
Shortly before two o'clock the
many friends of the contracting
parties gathered at the home
which was artistically decorated
with numerous bouquets of
sweet peas and ferns. Mrs.
M. I'jolland sang "The Little
Gray Home in the West" being'
accompanied on the piano by
Miss Doris Tillotson. Mr.
George Cooper theu sang "Be
cause", Mrs. Cooper presiding
at th? piano. Mrs. H. H.Full

of the Bridal Chorus", from
Lohengrin and the bride, leaning
oil the arm of her brother Jacob,
appeared'followed by the groom
and the bridesmaid, Miss Iua
Jefferson. Tliey took their plac
es in a bower of ferns and sweet
peas and the Rev. Fr. Hart read
•the very impressive ring service.
Shortly before the ceremony
the sun broke through the
clouds which hud covered it all
morning, and after the guests
had extended best wishes and
congratulations to Mr. and Mrs.
Erstad they adjourned to the
lawn which was provided witli
numerous seats and partook of a
delightful lunch served in two
courses. The Misses Elsie Klov
stad, Ruth Jacobson, Katherine
Roney and Agnes Peterson as
sisting in the serving.
Before the luncheon was
served the numerous young lady
friends formed a circle around
the bride who then threw the
bridal bouquet of white roses.
Miss May Kersting was the for
tunate recipient.
The bride'sjgown was of white
crepe de chene trimmed with
embroidered net. Her traveling
suit was blue taffeta with acces
sories to match. The brides
maid was gowned in white chif
fon trimmed with green over
white satin and carried a bou
quet of roses. The groom and
best man wore the conventional
dark suits.

ent were Mr. and Mrs. George

Miss Fullmer has been one of
Hope's most popular young la
dies. She passed thru the
grades of the local school and
was a member of the class grad
uated from Hope High School in
1912. Since her graduation she
has been a favorite teacher of
the pupils and parents in Hugo
Township. Mr. Erstad came to
our city a number of years ago
and was in the employ of the
Hope Implement Co. as sten
ographer and bookkeeper, hav
ing graduated from Aaker's
Business College in 1011. A
number of months ago he went
to Spiritwood to accept a more
lucrative position with a large
hardware and implement house.
The high esteem in which the
young couple were held was
shown by the numerous beauti
ful tokens which they received,
and these, when placed in their
new home, will continually bring
to mind their many friends in
our city and elsewhere.

Fried Chicken
I've feasted on viands of deli
cate llavor. No savory dish has
escaped me, I think I've dined
with the epicures ever so fanci
ful, but one dish has put all the
rest on the blink. I've eaten
concoctions of chefs, French and
German, and some of their dish
es were certainly tine, but I will
go back to the home in the coun
try and take a fried chicken with
gravy for mine. The East with
its spices is certainly able to
quiet man's hunger, his soul to
appease the West with its game
is alluring, quite truly, but I'll
pass them up, if your majesty
please. The swell dining rooms
of the city may call me their
service is great and their menus
invite, but someway I care not
to answer their calling, for out
in the country fried chicken is
ripe.
Are You Looking Old?
Old
age comes quick enough without
inviting it. Some look old at forty.
That is because they neglect the liver
and bowels. Keep your bowels regu
lar and your liver healthy and you
will not only feel younger but look
younger. When troubled with con
stipation and billiousness take Cham
berlain's Tablets. They are intended
especially for these ailments and are
excellent. Easy to take and most
agreeable in effect. Obtainable eve
rywhere.—Adv.
