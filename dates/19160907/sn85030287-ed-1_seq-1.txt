EIDSON FOR
WOODROW
Noted Inventor Declares He
Will Work and Vote For
.President Wilson
..Saratoga, N. Y. Sept. 3. Thorn
as A. Edison, inventor, life long
Republican, and a supporter of
Theodore Roosevelt for the Re
' publican, nomination, made an
, nouncement today of bis inten
. t tion to vote and work for Wood'
--' . row Wilson. He dictated the
following statement:
"Not since I860 has any cam
. ."; paign made such a direct call on
y simon pure Americanism. The
times are too serious to talk or
think in terms of Republicanism
or Democracy. Americans must
drop parties and get down to fun
damental principles.
More than any other president
in my memory, Wilson has been
faced by a succession of tremen
dous problems, anyone of which
decided the wrong way would
, have had disasterous consequen
ces. Wilson's decisions so far
. have not got us into any serious
trouble, nor are tbey likely to.
He has given us peace with
.honor. Tbis talk about the
" United States being despised is
nonsense. Neutrality is amighty
'trying policy, but back of it are
international la"', the rigdts of
- humanitj, and t!;e future of civ
,' uization.
; v With reference to Mexico, Ij
tVink the President has acted,
.(,-; wisely, justly, and courageously.
It baik been said Wiisou at fiast
was against preparedness. Per
; ' baps he was, but wshen convinc
ed that intelligent public opinion
was overwhelmingly in favor (of
it, be changed. That is the
proper thing for our President
., to do. A President defiant of
public opinion would be a dan
gerous man in our system of
- government."
Prosessionol Instittte
Meade county's first Profes
sional Teachers' Institute closed
last Friday. A good representa
tion of the teaching force ' of
Meade county was present and
much interest was shown. The
old four weeks Institute with its
daily drill on the branches
taught in the rural schools, and
the cramming for the examina
tion at the close is a thing of the
Jpast, and from this year on the
five-day Professional Institute
. will be in vogue, as our teachers
all' seem to like that idea much
the better.
On Friday evening an enter
tainment was given in the school
auditorium, and at the conclu
sion, Mrs. Pearl Wood Smith,
County Superintendent, was pre
sented with a handsome cut
glass punch bowl, the same being
a gift of the teachers, as their
token of appreciation to her for
the untiring effort she has'made
throughout her four years in of
fice, to bring the standard of the
rural schools of Meade county up
to that of any in the union.
Fair Specials
I have on hand the following
which I desire to close-out at
bargains during Fair week:
several Buckeye grain drills, 4
Milwaukee mowers, 4 sets heavy
, work harness, a quantity of bind
ing twine, and other articles.
Call and get prices.

Mr. P. A. Carrell and Miss
Clara A. Brora well, both of Plains
were united in marri&ge Wed
nesday, September 6th by Pro
bate Judge Marrs.
H. N. Holdeman of this citv
expects to exhibit some of his
Percheron horses at the State
Fair. He has some of the finest
stock in the county and will
make a showing' well worth
while.- .
School Begins Monday
The Meade city schools begin
next Monday. A list of the
teachers employed has already
been published in this naner.
From their credentials they are
the-best to be had, and will no
doubt do their part toward mak
ing the coming year one of the
most successful in the history of
the school. Meade high school is
up to the standard of any in the
state, "and those who have chil
dren to whom they desire to give
a higher education than the
common school, can not do better
than to send them to Meade. The
school is costing the taxpayers
no nttie amount and students en
tering should make the most ofuret. it when
the opportunity offered.

Two Undesirables
Two very distinguished gentle
menMessrs. Holt and Shaw, so
they gave their names, and
whose addresses we did not learn
were brought before County
Attorney Sullivan the first of the"
week. It seems that they had no
occupation, unless it was ped
dling booze. No' positive proof
was at hand, but indications
pointed that way. The gentle
men were advised to leave town
"while going was good," this or
der going into effect immediate
ly. As all the trains had gone
that dayv, they wanted to remain
until the next day, but deputy
sheriff Dettinger promptly in
formed them that the order
from the County Attorney said
"immediately," therefore there
was no waiting for , ariother
train. - They went immediately.
Mr. Dettinger very kindly es
corted them two miles out of
town in his automobile, and from
that point they were invited to
walk. When last seen they were
going west, so if they land in any
of the towns down the line this
notice-will serve as a formal in
troduction. A consignment of
booze for one of the individuals
is now at the depot, but it is safe
to say he will not return to call
for it.

THE STRIKE
- IS SETTLED
Through The Efforts of The
President the Country is
Saved From Strike
Washington, Sept. 3. The Ad
amson 8-Hour Day bill, exacted
from congress last week by the
railroad brotherhoods as the
price of calling off the nation
wide strike ordered for tomor
row, was signed by President
Wilson today in his private car
at the Union Station, where he
stopped on his way from Shadow
Lawn, N. J., to Hodgenville, Ky.
That there may be no question
as to the legality of the measure
as a result of it having been
signed on Sunday, the President
will affix his signature again up
on his return to Washington
Tuesday.
' How long peace shall reign as
a result of the bill apparently is
dependent upon developments in
the proposed move to test the
constitutionality of the act.
Should the railroads take no ac
tion, but await the beginning of
an investigation of the workings
of the 8-hour day by the special
commission for which the meaS'
ure provides, the brotherhoods
will remain inactive.
Still Keep Strike as Weapon
The employees' leaders de
clare, however, that should the
law be held unconstitutional and
th railroads attempt to restore
the 10-hour day on their lines, a
strike will follow promptly.
Brotherhoods in a circular let
tor to their members today made
no comment on the measure as
parsed. They merely pointed
out that it would not become ef
fective until next January 1, and
that many things might occur
between now d . then, which
would change; materially any
suggestions or comment they
mitfht make.
None of the brotherhood lead
era witnessed the signing of the
bill, which was attended by no
ceremony, the President writing
his name upon the bill at the
station, where it had been taken
Near the car window a group of
trainmen in their overalls
paused in their work long
enough to watch the President
write his'ftame. An engineer
passing on a yard engine, cele
brated the occasion with several
prolonged blasts of his whistle.
Frank Crocker 'received word
Tuesday that his mother, who
resides in Cherokee, Oklahoma,
was critically ill. He left for her
bedside immediately. His many
Meade friends hope for her early
recovery. -
Mrs. M. J. Henry returned last
Saturday from the eastern part
of the state, where she has been
for the past several months. She

Federal Farm Loan Board
All of the farmers and busi
ness men of Western Kansas
who are interested in long time
loans at a low rate of interest for
farmers will have a chance to ap
pear before the Federal Farm
Loan Board at Hutchinson on
Tuesday, September 19th, all
day. They will meet at the Com
mercial Club at 9:00 o'clock in
the morning and will hold two
meetings at the Fair Grounds at
10 :30 in the morning and at 1 :30
in the afternoon.
The board iff- districting
the entire United States and
their plans contemplated touch
ing Kansas at one point only.
The original rout ing would bring
them from Omaha to Kansas
City, Kansas, as their only stop
in the "sunflower state." Owing
to the representation made them
of the especial needs in Kansas
the board has been induced to
change their entire plans and to
come through Kansas from th?
west so thatjthtiy may stfop at
Hutchinson icr u hea-.-lRgl .This-. :
is a nattering . recognition: of
western Kansas as an important
agricultural district, and an an-
preciation of it can be shown on
ly by every county in the west
ern part of Kansas having a rep
resentative before .the board
at .Hutchinson on Tuesday.
If the interest shown by
all of these counties is strong
enough it is believed that the
board may be induced to estab
lish a Federal Farm Loan Bank
at Hutchinson where it will be
in the heart of the greatest agri
cultural district of the country.
The interest manifested at the
hearing at Hutchinson will very
argely determine whether Kan
sas or one of the adjoining states
Will secure the location of the
Farm Loan Bank for the district
in which Kansas is placed. This
is a matter of vast importance to
the development of western Kan
sas and the Farm Loan Board
will be glad to meet representa
tives from every county and ex
plain the principle and workings
of these banks to be established
under the rural credits bill. The
system is devised to make it pos
sible at all times for a farmer to
secure a loan at a low rate of in- .
terest and for as long a time as
needed.
In getting one of these banks
much will depend upon the inter
est shown from every part of the
district so that your influence in
this matter will be very import
ant.
