Well-Known Bartender Tells
Friends Over Phone He
Is Married.
WEDDING FOLLOWS A
6-MONTHS ROMANCE
Bride, Mrs. Skiles, Is Manager
of Green Tree
Hotel.
Henry Muelbach well known bar
tender at the Claud Speak saloon, last
night, according to an unconfirmed
report, eloped with his landlady, Mrs.
Skiles, manager of the Green Tree
Hotel, and the couple were married.
Friends of the couple who learned of
the marriage last night were unable
to ascertain where the marriage took
place, whether it was in Jackson or
Benton.
Late last night, Blick Kopper, who is
Muelbach's companion on watch at the
Speak saloon, received a long distance
telephone call from Muelbach, when
the latter declared that he had obtain
ed the papers and his wedding was his
tory. When he first called Hopper he de
clared that he had obtained the papers
and had "put his deal through." Kop
per demanded to know what he meant,
whereupon Muelbach admitted that he
was a benedict.
The couple left the Cape in the auto
mobile of Frank Burford last night
after Muelbach had finished his work.
He worked up to 6 o'clock in the even
ing, without saying a word of his plans
to his employer. He even declined to
"tip" off Kopper when the latter re
lieved him at 6 o'clock.
Muelbach has been a regular guest
at the Green Tree Hotel since it was
revamped and opened by Mrs. Skiles.
She came to the Cape about six
months ago, and the couple became ac
quainted at that time. Their acquaint
ance grew and ripened into love, and
intimate friends of both have known
for several days that they were plan
ning to be married.
Mrs. Skiles is a widow with two
small children. Muelbach was born
and raised in the Cape. He is about
37 y?ars old, and his parents as well as
two brothers reside in the Cape.
Kopper last night believed that the
marriage had been performed at Jack
son, but G. F. Siemers, county record
er, last night declared that he had not
issued a marriage license to the couple.
For that reason it is believed the cou
ple went to Benton.
POPLAR BLUFF CITY LIGHT
PLANT LAYS CORNERSTONE
Big Crowd Tramps in Heat and Drinks
Free Red Lemonade at
Municipal Exercises.
A crowd of several hundred men
and women yesterday afternoon
tramped a quarter of a mile, stood
around in the hot sun and drank free
red lemonade at the cornerstone lay
ing exercises in Poplar Bluff at the
new municipal light and power plant.
Th? $75,000 structure is slated to be
done and in operation by the first of
the year. Virtually all the steel work
hsa been completed, and already the
brick work has mounted to the second
floor.
Mayor R. G. Felts and the city coun
selor delivered the most important ad
dresses at the meeting and several of
the city councilmen made short talks.
The building was tied up for about two
years by litigation in the U. S. Dis
trict Court, and the construction was
allowed to go ahead last spring when
the City of Poplar Bluff won its side
of the suit instituted.

Products.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Washington, Sept. 6. Senator Ash-
urst of Arizona, in a fit of raere this
afternoon, leaped across the aisle, sep
arating the Democrats from the Re
publican Senators and shook his fist
in the face of Senator Curtis of Kan
sas, Republican.
Pointing his finger in the Kansan's
face, the Arizona Democrat branded
Curtis a "pharisee." The Kansas Sen
ator enly smiled at the enraged Ari
zona statesman, who then turned his
batteries on Senator Boise Penrose of
Pennsylvania whom he called a "liar."
He retracted this epithet, however, on
demand of his Democratic colleagues.
Ashurst lost his temper and precipi
tated the scene during the debate over
the corrupt practice bill, which was
before the Senate for consideration.
Senator Curtis of Kansas read a let
ter, which Senator Ashurst had frank
ed to his Arizona constituents, claim
ing it to be a public document. Cur
tis offered this evidence to show that
Ashurst would come under the cor
rupt practice act.
Senator Ashurst's face flushed and
he became belligerent. Demanding
that the Kansan apologize for the
statement that he (Ashurst) should
not be in the Senate, Ashurst arose
from his seat and attempted to charge
Senator Curtis.
Senator Boise Penrose, Republican,
from Pennsylvania, waved the red
flag at Ashurst when he declared that
the fopper lobby had induced Ashurst
to vote to strike out copper in. the mu
nitions tax bill.
Before the Senate was restored to
order and the danger of a roughhouse
removed, it was brought out that My
ron T. Herrick of Ohio, Republican
nominee for United States Senator,
had spent $6000 more than his salary
for the United States Senator will ag
gregate in six years, in order to win
the nomination in the state-wide pri
mary. It was shown that Herrick had
spent this much of his own money, but
no effort was made to show how much
additional had been contributed by
friends. As Mr. Herrick recently de
clared he was for national prohibition,
it is understood that the Ohio drys
contributed liberally to his campaign.
'CAVE MAN" DIES BY
POLICEMAN'S SHOT
Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 5. Police de
clare that when "Wild Bill" Latura
was shot to death by Patrolman John
C. Lyons the last real Memphis "bad
man" bit the dust. He had killed seven
persons during the 30 years of his life.
Once he killed four negroes within five
minutes in a saloon. Here is Wild
Bill's record:
1906 Dave S. Wright, killed with
baseblal bat.
1907Albcrt Hunt, wounded with
shotgun.
1908 Henry Mitchell, negro porter,
wounded with pistol.
1909 Killed Bob Carter, Charlie
Miller, Clarence Allen, Leslie Williams
all negroes; wounded Birdie Hmes,
Richard Slott and Robert, all negroes.
1910 Fatally wounded unknown ne
gro woman.
1911 Wounded Sallie James, r.egro
woman with knife.
1913 Killed "Alabama Tom," ne
gro. Latura was known as the "Cave
Man of the Memphis Jungles." He was
"Boss" in the underworld district and
although he had the blood of many
whites and blacks on his hands he
spent only a few weeks in jail. He was
too valuable to the reigning politicians
to be kept in jail. He was needed in
every election and he did valiant work.
His reward was to cut and kill, rob and
sell liquor in defiance of the law.
But during the last twelve months
the "Law and Order' element of Mem
phis has gained the upper hand. Two
Judges, three mayors, a sheriff and
some minor officials have been ousted

TO "UNVEIL" NEW
MUSICBOX TUESDAY
Schuchert Band Will Give First
Free Concert of Fall
Series.
The Cape's new bandstand will fig
uratively be "unveiled" next Tuesday
evening when Dr. C. E. Schuchert's
conceit band will play the first con
cert from the new stand.
Announcement of the opening series
of free concerts that will last for the
remainder of the fall was made yes
terday afternoon by Dr. Schuchert as
he viewed the work that will lead to
the completion of the stand.
The concert, in addition to being the
first of the free series, also will be
the opening entertainment for the vis
itors who come to the Cape to attend
the Cape County Fair in the daytime.
The members of the band have been
rehearsing regularly each week in
preparation for their playing in the
Courthouse Park and at the Fair
grounds during the fair.
The new bandstand, when completed,
will be unquestionably, the finest in
Southeast Missouri. The base, foun
dation and floor as well as the eight
octagonal pillars all are made of solid
concrete. The- top is being finished
now in stucco work. The sides of the
foundation have been decorated with
white stucco panels and the pillars
will be finished in the same manner.
The columns, one at each corner, will
be connected with an iron railing, and
on the eastern side, there is a flight of
steps leading from the ground to the
floor of the stand.
The bandstand will cost a total of
approximately $1400 or $1500 when it
is done. It was estimated the orig
inal cost would be $1200 but cost of
material and work have boosted the
price to the higher figure. The City
Council donated $400 out of the park
funds for the stand, and virtually all
rough material used in the stand were ,
donated by firms in the Cape.
Dr. Schuchert has been assured by
jnany merchants in the Cape that in
making up the deficit he will receive
their aid. Each of the political county
central committees have promised a
contribution of $25 toward the stand.
The stand will frequently be used for
political speeches and similar gather
ings in the park.
In advertising the free concerts at
the park, Dr. Schuchert said he ex
pects to cover Ulmo, Forafelt, Jack
son and many nearby towns for per
sons have assured him they will come
to the Cape to hear the concerts when
ever they are given.
for failure to enforce the laws. The
law enforcement squad finally reached
Latura's drive, where he sold whiskey
and gambled. He warned young Ly
ons, the nervy patrolman, to "leave me
alone or take what them niggers got."
The patrolman was persistent. Latura
started to draw a pistol. The patrol
man fired, wounding the "Cave Man."
Wild Bill, wounded, washed toward an
automobile. He was felled by another
shot. In the automobile for which he
was racing was found two automatic
pistols, a Winchester rifle and several
rounds of ammunition.

Fight Is Started
Over Big, Juicy
Ripe Watermelon
Jim Tines, in Heat of Debate,
Punctures Scalp for W. H.
Barr With Fist Blow on
Head Pleads Guilty and
Pays His Fine Soon After.
A large, ripe, red, juicy, watery
watermelon yesterday afternoon start
ed an argument that resulted in W. D.
Barr, retired dentist, getting hit on the
head. The blow caused a laceration
more than an inch long in Barr's scalp
over the right temple nnd last night
the wound was serious.
A few hours later James Tines,
Frisco fireman, surrendered and paid
a fine of $14.80 after making a plea of
guilty before Judge W. H. Wilier, who
had issued a warrant on the affidavit
of Barr.
The men were sitting in the alley
south of Good Hope street and leading
past "Red" Mabrey's barber shop.
While they were busily engrossed in
the watermelon, the argument was
started. Tines got to his feet and
struck Barr three times, Barr said.
Tines then left and Barr, when he
had recovered his senses, walked to
the Wasem drug store and had Dr.
Paul R. Williams tie his head up.
WEST END HIDDEN
IN A WEED PATCH
Wmen Forced to Wade Through
Undergrowth That Laps
Over Pavements,
Uncut weeds are gradually turning
the western part of the city into a
wilderness. From Henderson avenue
west to Louisiana, the weeds, more
than waist high, lap over the side
wilks causing inconvenience to women
pedestrians.
Since the dust became heavy in that
part of the city, the weeds have been
especially annoying to the women liv
injr on William street. The weeds
hold dust and distribute it over dresses
as the women wade through the vege
tation. After each rain the dust-laden
weeds become especially annoying.
At William street, where the street
cars turn north of the Boulevard, there
are two fields, each containing more
than five acres, where the weeds have
reached almost record heights. But
these do not cause complaints, because
the pavements do not run through
them.
The sidewalks on William street,
from the Boulevard to Henderson ave
nue, a distance of about two blocks,
have been placed in eclipse by the high
weeds.
The ladies living in that part of the
city are preparing to appeal to Mayor
Kage to have Health Commissioner
Stone order the undergrowth cut. In
previous years the weeds have been
permitted to grow almost unmolested,
but the present crop hold a record for
size as well as the prolific yield.

TOM GILL CAUGHT
IN BOYS' BATTLE
Walks Into No Man's Land Be
tween Lines and Nearly
Gets Hit.
Complaint was made to the police
last night by Tom Gill, a conductor
on the C. G. & X., about a gang of
small boys, who, while bombarding a
group of Good Hope street negroes,
narrowly missed hitting Mr. Gill
in the right eye with one of their
missiles, a rock the size of a hand
grenade.
Mr. Gill was on his way home at 324
South Lorimier street, from work late
last night at the time the pitched bat
tle took place between the white boys
and the group of negroes, and he un
suspectingly crossed the "firing" line
of the negro boys and strode into the
"no man's land" that lay between the
entrenched armies.
He was on the walk in front of the
residence of Dr. R. F. Wichterich when
a high-power pebble raced overhead.
The stone encountered a tree limb and
glanced downward.
The rock brushed past his face, an
inch from the eye-lid, Mr. Gill said,
seared his shoulder and bounded on
the sidewalk. Mr. Gill ducked and
made his escape from the zone of
danger.
Neighbors in the vicinity of the bat
tleground declare that the contest be
tween the two sides has been going
on almost nightly, but on the arrival
of the police, the boys were gone.
W. H. Bohnsack Sr., was struck on
the back of the head Tuesday by a
stone thrown by a small boy who de
manded that Mr. Bohnsack turnover a
five-cent piece to him. When Mr.
Bohnsack declined to listen to the
terms of the boy, the lad backed off
and the bombardment started.
A warrant was issued and the lad
was arrested, but he was released yes
terday by Police Judge Fristoe after
a reprimandation.

TO WORK IN FIELDS
Berne, Sept. 6. A decree promul
gated in the principality of Lippe
threatens all women who refuse to
work in the fields as harvesters with
punishment. Those who, as wives of
soldiers at the front, are drawing sep
aration allowances, will be deprived
of them. In the event of being inac

kind the women shirkers will be im
prisoned. An almost identical decree
has been promulgated in the Duchy of

GOVT OWNERSHIP TO
BE REVENUE PRODUCER
After War It Is Believed Uncle
Sam's Revenue Will Be Prun
edHearing Nov. 20.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Washington, Sept. 6. The Congres
sional committee, appointed to inves
tigate the railroad problem, decided
today to begin hearings on November
20, or about two weeks after the elec
tion. The inquiry will cover the relations
of wages to the receipts of the rail
roads. The commission will also give
attention to the feasibility of govern
ment ownership of the railroads. It
will also make recommendations with
reference to the efficiency of the pres
ent system of protecting the rights of
shippers and carriers, and suggest
changes in the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
The commission is expected to re
port, if possible, a short time after the
eight-hour law goes into effect, which
will be January 1, 1917. It is under
stood that President Wilson is in favor
of the government taking control of
the railroads, and if he is re-elected,
his close friends say he will urge the
enactment of legislation which will
bring about government ownership of
the railroads.
Democratic leaders in Congress are
in favor of taking over the railroads
as a revenue producer. After the war
it is believed there will be a slump in
Uncle Sam's annual earnings, and with
the increased cost of government
maintenance due to the unusual ac
tivity in naval and army preparedness,
it will be necessary to swell the nor
mal revenue.
The railroads, if placed under gov
ernment ownership, would place the
government upon a solid financial ba
sis. President Wilson has been in
conference with several prominent
railroad men, who are friendly to the
executive, and he has been able to as
certain approximately what the rail
roads could earn for the government.

He comes from Dawson City. "I

I came right along." He came alone,
the only man from Dawson, by stage
coach and steamboat, over 1000 miles
to England, Victoria, and thence all
the 6000 miles to England.
He was farming in Portland, Oregon,
when the news of the great gold
"strike" flew across America. He
promptly sold his farm and made hi
way with hundreds of other adventur
ous men to the Yukon. When the gold
seekers got there the snow ay three
feet depe on the ground where their
tents were to be pitched. During the
18 years that followed the miner has
remained at Dawson, mining in the
summer and hunting and trapping in
the winter.
Now, though too old for the infan
try, he hopes to get out to the front
in a medical corps.
