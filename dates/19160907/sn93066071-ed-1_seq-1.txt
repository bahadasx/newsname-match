ment
A bank account shows that you are seeking to make the
most of your efforts and your time.
It is, besides, a mark of solidity. It gives a man standing
in the eyes of others as a solid citizen.
The world confers its favors on those who prove capable of
doing justice to themselves as well as to others. In justice to
yourself you should start a bank account.

SCHOOL OPENED MONDAY.
The familiar chime of the school bell
may be heard again this week, calling
young America to "books," school
having opened lieut Monday. The en
rollment in the grades oxccedB the two
hundred mnrk and a verv crowded con
dition prevails. There bing only firar
rooms in the old building and live
teachers employed, it Is necessary for
two teachers to occupy the same room
until the new building is ready, which
will not bn until the first of the year
Every room is full to overflowing. The
high school is also in a crowded condi
tion, Tho enrollment there is more
than ninety, This number, together
with tho 7th and 8th grades, which are
at the II S building, fills the building
almost to capacity, Tho situation Is
being handled as well as possible, but
the best results cannot be obtained
until the new grade school building is
completed. This will then provide
ample room for all grades and the high
school having the room which tho 7th
and 8th grades have been occupying,
will five them plenty of room.
STOP THE FIRST COLO.
A cold does not get well of itself
The process of wearing out a cold
wears you out and your cough becomes
serious if neglected. Hacking coughs
drain the energy and Bap the vitality.
For 47 years tho happy combination of
soothing antiseptic balsams in Dr.
King's New Discovery has healed
coughs and relieved congestion. Young
and old can testify to the effectiveness
of Dr. King's New Discovery for coughB
and colds Buy a bottle to-day at your
Druggist's, ftOc.
SPEED LIMIT. TWELVE MILES.
The long-needed speed limit ordi
nance for Beaver has at last bem
passed by the City Council and Bigna
were erected the past week on .the
principal streets advising auto drivers
that tnelve miles per hour was the
limit for speeding within the city lim
its. We hope to see the ordinance
rigidly enforced anu all vlolaters, re
gardltss of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude "pulled."
Heretofore it h( been tho habit of
eomtMlrivers toiee just bow faBt they
could speed through Douglas Avenue
anu man or beast has not been safu on
the streets. Many narrow escapes have
been experienced, and the fear that
some child would be killed before the
fast driving was called to a halt, has
been felt by a great number. We are
glad-to see the city dads take the mat
ter in hand, and we trust that no mer
cy may be shown the speeders A few
good stiff fines would have a tendency
to induce more carefbl driving.
CLEAR BAD SKIN FROM WITHIN.
Pimply, muddy complexions are duo
to impurities in the blood. Clear up
the skin by taking Dr. King's New Life
Pills. Their mild laxative qualities
remove the poisons from tho system
and brightens the eye. A full, free,
non-griping bowel movement in the
morning is the reward of a dose of Dr.
King's New J.ife Pills the night before.
