table information given the military
authorities here today that Pancho
Villa, with 1,500 men, fully supplied
,-wlth arms and ammunition, was less
than 100 mllea from the American

here that Villa, In a desporate effort
to discredit First Chief Carranxa, will
aacrlflce a part of his command by
ending it against the outposts of the
. American expeditionary force.
Thousands of Vagal Indiana In the
district between Navajoa and duay-
mas are on the warpath, killing near
ly a hundred ranchers and devastat

New London, Conn., Sept 7. Ex
tensive financial aid for Mexico will
bo one of the vital problems ot the
American-Mexican commission. Every
effort will be made to avoid anything
that suggests benevolence. Dut If
there la assurances of lasting stable
conditions bolow the Rio Orande, then
the American government will lend
Its moral support to the floating ot a
big Mexican loan In this country.
This was learned reliably today as
the American and Mexican commis
sioners "recessed" In their confer
ences until tomorrow,
There were no Joint sessions today.
Instead the commissioners delved In
to dsta on border subjects and the
American commissioners planned aft
Informal session on questions present

SANTA FE TO IGNORE
THE ADAMSON BILL
Chicago. Sept, 7. Western rail
road officials were reticent today as to
whether they would follow the action
of President K. P. Ripley of the 8anta
Fe, who has declared his road will
Ignore the A dam son eight-hour bill
until forced to recognize It.
We sre not ready at this time to
make any statement," said E. D.
Sewell. Tlce-presldent of the C. M.
A St. P.
At the offices of the Burlington and
Northwestern It was stated that they
had mado no plans. '
Topeka. Has., Sept. ".The Atchi
son, Topeka A Snnta Fe railroad will
not comply with the Adamson eight
hour law until commanded to do so
by the court of last resort.
This was learned definitely here to
day following a formal statement Is
sued by K. P. Ripley, president of the
Santa Fe, before returning to Chi
cago. "
"The new law, 'hastily enacted by
congress, Is nothing more or less than
an advance of 20 to 25 per cent In
the wanes of the best patd men In
railroad service," Ripley said. "The
Santa Fe will not comply with the
law until ordered to do so by the
court of laat resort."
Ripley said that any other class of
railway workers is entitled to more
money than the trainmen, The Santa
Fe head was in Topeka with other
officials .attending the funeral of
Charles W. Kouni, late general man
ager of the eastern lines.
8t. Paul, 8ept. 7. The Great
Northern will scrupulously obey the
provisions of the Adamson eight-hour
bill, It was announced today. This
announcement, coming In the face of
the Santa Fe announcement that It
would obey none of the provisions of
the 1)111, seemed to substantiate a Te
cent rumor In railroad circles Ihere.
This waa that either the Great North
ern or the Santa Fe would be chosen
to flagrantly violate the bill, to force
government action that would bring
a test In court The Santa Fe was
chosen, It was said, because of the
strength of Its legal department.

the world at the end of the present
ar, bringing with It the enfranchise
ment ot women, both In the 'United
States and Europe, Mrs. Carrie Chap

pital, from camp and munition fac
tory," said Mrs. Catt. "In Great
Britain hundreds of bitter, active op
ponents have confessed their conver

of women. Above the roar of the
cannon, tle scream of shrapnel and
the whirr of the aeroplanes, one who
listens may hear the crackling of fet
ters which have long hound the Euro
pean women to outworn conventions.
"The woman's hour has struck. It
haa struck tor the women of Europe
and for those of all the world. It
our own people possess the sense of
patriotism and the sense of nation
ality which should be the Inheritance
of an American, they will not wait
until the war Is ended ibut will boldly
lead In tho Inevitable march ot
democracy, our own American spe
cialty." .
