EL PASO, Tex., Sept 7. General
Pershing, acting upon a suggestion
from General Funston, Is reported
hurrying back to field headquarters
from CoIum,bus, N. Mex., following re
liable information given to military
authorities here that Villa with 1,500
men fully supplied with arms and
ammunition was massing them 100
miles from the American outposts.
Fears are openly expressed here
that Villa in a desperate effort to dis
credit Carranza will sacrifice part of
his command by sending it against the
outposts of the American expedition
ary force.

between Navajos and Guaymas are on

TO GIVE FINANCIAL AID
Commission to Discuss Ex
tensive Help for Mexico
at Meeting.
By United Tress.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 7. Ex
tensive financial aid for Mexico will
be one of the 1tal problems of the
American-Mexican commission. Ev
ery effort will be made to avoid any
thing that suggests benevolence. But
if there are assurances of reaching
stable conditions below the Rio
Grande then the American govern
ment will lend its moral support to
the floatation of a big Mexican loan
in this country.
This was learned reliably today
after the American and Mexican com
missioners recessed until tomorrow.
There was no joint session today. In
stead the Mexican commissioners
delved into data on border subjects,
and the American commissioners
planned an informal session on ques
tions presented yesterday. The Amcri
can commissioners are optimistic
over the outcome of the conferences.

Claims He Was Called Anarchist
Chicago Tribune Defendant
By United Pren.

States District Court today against

Anarchist"

that Ford would discharge all his
employes who joined the National
Guard to go to the Mexican border.

RUMANIA IS LOSING
Germans and Bulgars Gain
Greatest Victory Since Ru
mania Entered War.
By United Press.
LONDON, Sept. 7. The German and

greatest victory in the Balkans since
Rumania entered the war, eleven days
ago.
The strongly fortified Rumanian
town bf Tutrakan on the Danube,
blocking the way to the Rumanian
capital, only thirty-three miles to the
northwest, has been captured with
20,000 prisoners.
The Germans and Bulgarians struck
a quick Wow that caught the Ruman
ians on the south bank of the Dan
ube, and besides capturing more than
half a Rumanian army corps, bagged
100 guns and caused the Rumanians
heavy losses, Berlin reported this af
ternoon.
The loss of Tutrakan was officially
admitted by the Russian war office.
though no mention was made of Rus
sian forces co-operating in the de
fence. The German war office later

to prisoners and guns.

URGES CO-OPERATION
OF CITY AND SCHOOL
President A. Ross Hill of
the University Talks to
Commercial Club.
'M. U. NEEDS MONEY'
Says Columbians Appreciate
Opportunities M.U.
Gives Them.
The relation Columbia holds to the
State University may be reviewed from
so many angles that it is quite im
possible to cover the entire ground in
one luncheon talk," said A. Ross Hill,
president of the University today in
a speech at the Commercial Club lun
cheon at Harris.
"The town should be so well kept
in general that it will attract the visi
tor and convince the prospecUve stu
dent and his parents that it Is a de
sirable place to live in; its sanitary
provisions and regulations should be
such that the health of students can
be easiy safeguarded during their per
iod of residence here; and the forms
of amusement and recreation that the
town affords should be such as will
elevate rather than lower the ideals
of life and encourage the development
of those habits that university train
ing Is meant to faster and establish
in the youth who are to be leaders
in state service after their training
here-
"Happlly Columbia has done much
in these directions during the last
decade. There are still some details'
to be worked out but In the main the
town and the individual citizens of
the town have taken such forethought
in these matters that we can lay claim
to having one of the most attractive.
healthful and morally wholesome uni
versity seats in America.
"M. U. Seeds More Money."
"The great need in our situation Is
more money with which to furnish
adequate facilities for the' instruction J
of the increasing number of students
who flock to Columbia. The day has
gone by when we need to directly con
cern ourselves with efforts to secure
increased enrollment An attractive
city and the national reputation of
the University of Missouri will bring
numbers as the population and wealth
of Missouri and the Southwest in
creases. But the standing of the
University can be maintained and ad
vanced only by securing funds that
are comparable with those supplied to
other state universities in its class.
What is the situation today? The
state appropriations for the Univer
sity tof Illinois and for the University
of Wisconsin are each four times those
of Missouri, while Michigan and Min
nesota get three times as much as
Missouri, though In Michigan both the
College of Agriculture and the Me
chanic Arts and the School of Mines
are separate Institutions. Those of
us responsible for the .administration
of the University'can well be proud
of the standing attained by this Uni
versity under these financial condi
tions. The situation is briefly this:
No other 'state In the Union is .getting
such returns for its investments In
its state university.
People Should Back University.
Now what can Columbia do In this
matter of appropriations? The State
University is not in any sense a sec
tional institution. It cannot succeed
in securing appropriations by log-rolling
or trading for it ha sno sectional
support It ought to and it must win on
Its merits only. Columbia people
should be more familiar with Its mer
its and be able and ready at all times
to defend Its good name. Its bene
fits to Columbia are general and as it
must be administered in the Interests
of the entire state, no individual citi
zen or class of citizens In Columbia
can look for direct and personal ad
vantage from the expenditure of the
University funds-or from th corganized
activities of the students. But the ex
istence of the University in Colum
bia and its general prosperity are vital
to the interests of the entire town
and all Its citizens Any action tend
ing to discredit the University be
fore the people of Missouri is disloy
alty to the town of Columbia i
The University Is embarrassed at t
practically every session of the Legis
lature by false rumors regarding ex
travagance and irregularities In the
expenditure of funds and most of these
falsehoods are started In Columbia.
They are always exploded when the
University gets its hearing before leg-
