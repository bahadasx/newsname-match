Washington.?The threat of n gen- oral
railroad strike which hung like
a pall over the country for a month
- was lifted when the Senate passed "
the Adnmson bill. w
Three hours after the senate had
passed without amendment the Adam- j

house, the heads of the four great

graphed 6ft0 odd rode messages to
their general chairmen in all parts (]
of iiie country cancelling the strike
order issued a week ago to take s,
effect Labor Day at 7 <o'clock.
The legislative expedient to avert
the strike was passed in the senate
by a vote of -IS to 28?almost a strict t)
party vote?amid stirring scenes (>
after many Senutors, Democrats and
Republicans, had fought desperately .
to amend the measure by provisions p
designated to prevent industrial disasters
in the future. Some senators
t | iroughly aroused, declared Cong- h
ress was being coerced into enactment u
of legislation that it did not desire, '
and that It knew would return to ]
plague it in the future.
fi
In both houses the measure was
signed within a few minutes after the .
final vote in the senate and it was
sent at once to the White House.
Officials of the brotherhoods who .
witnessed the final pa -sage of the bill ( i
had announced early in the night that (]

secured.

The bill that stopped the strike pro tvtdes
that after January 1. 1017 1 u
eight hours shall be regarded as a p

Kfforts to amend the hill in the
Senate were futile, the supreme effort
to alter it ha > ing been led by Setial n
| Underwood, who sought to provide j,
' tb a the Interstate Commerce Com- ,.
mission should have power to fix rail- (j
f road wages and hours for service in J
the future. This amendment was de-. t|
feated by a vote of 57 to 14. P
Railroad officials have declanty that o
^ the action ot Congress will cost them \
$(10,000,000 a year in increased wages ji
to the trainmen. Brotherhood offlc g
1 inls say the enactment will mean not ri
I more than an annual increase of $20,- ;
\ 000,000. In Congress and among the | *
\ railroad officials thrre has existed i n
doubt as to the constitutionality of ; a
V the law, but what steps if any may m
be taken to test this has not been in- i w
dicateil. tl
Quick action by the brotherhood ;
heads followed the action in the Sen j si
ate. No doubt existed In tlioir minds j

the President's original proposals to u

although It is only a part of the lex- w
islative program ho took to Congress
last Tuesday when his negotiations .?
had failed. h
Issuance of the orders of cancella- !

brotherhood heads and thirteen re- tl
ninining members of their committee fi
of 640. Some opposition to acting l>e- tl
fore the President actually had af- e
fixed his signature was evidence In u
the meeting, but In the end the 17 a
voted unanimously to call off the t<
strike immediately. All of tho code
messages had heen prepared in ad- i oi
vance and as quickly as the decision | t<
was announced clerks rushed to tele- tt
graph offices with arm loads of the j V
messages. lr
No two of the more than 600 dispatches
were alike. One of them read h
"It Is reported that a big fire is rag r<
ing ill Toronto." Another said "There ft
is danger of your house burning down w
tomorrow." Even the brotherhoods
did not know what all the messages ir
contained, the composition of them tl
having bbcen left to clerks. n

Section 4 That any person vlolatig
any provision of ?!iis act shall In
ned not less than $100 and not more
Ian $t,000, or imprisoned not to ex
eed one year, or both.
Brotherhoods A>-e Pleased.
"The enactment of this piece of leg lation,"
said A. It. Garretson. head
f the con luctors' brotherhood, "glv
is as it dors an eight-hour <inv for
very man employed in the operating
epartment of tin- railroads of this
ountry from the Canadian border to
ie Gulf and front the Atlantic to the
'aelfle is a wonderful thing. It not
nly affects the brotherhoods and the
est paid men who come under their
trisdiotion but it reaches far enough
own the line to give the negro railikmI
worker of the south his chance.
"I do not care whether the bill is
igned on Sunday or >oine other day,
or docs the constitutionality of such
n act bother me. If the President
ees fit to sign it mi that day I'll be
dlling to accept his judgment that
ie act is legal."
W. G. Lee, head of the trainmen.
[\ld:
"Of course I am pleased that we
ave avoided a strike. We did not
rant a strike any more than any
ne in this country, but wo had come
"? a point where if a strike becam
ece?sary to win our demands we
ere willing to go into one. I feel
'ui(id? *'t too that we would have
merged victorious if a strike had
ecu necessary.
"That .situation, however, now is
ast. It is probable, of course. tb:<t
ie railroads will ask for increased
eight rates. If 'hey can show that
lev are deserving of them the brothrlx
>ds wilj help obtain them. Hut
nless then can show good cause for
dvnnces. of course we will not go

"Tho hill as enacted today does not
on tain all that we should have Iikoc

All of the brotherhood leaders were
icllned to regard lightly reports that j
lat railroads would make a determln 1
[1 fight on the constitutionality of

Declares Civil War Chief Was Embodiment
cf True Democracy.?Receives
Gift of Lincoln Farm Association.
Hodgenville. Kv. President Wilson ,
1 came to Kentucky to pay homage to
j the memory of Lincoln and avoid politick
but a great crowd gathered from
all parts of the state, cheered him at
' -every appearance and turned his visit
1 into a campaign event.
The president accepted for the
Federal government the log cabin in
which Lincoln was born In a speech
devoted to an eulogy of the Civil \Vnv
- president. Standing on a temporary
1 platform at the foot of n hilf topped
by a magnificent granite memorial I
' building housing the Lincoln cabin
he nraised Lincoln as the embodiment
of democracy.
"How eloquent this little house
I within this shrine is of the vigor of
democracy." exclaimed the president
as he spoke of Lincoln as exemplifying
the American spirit as showing the
heights which men of lowly birth may
1 attain.
"We are not worthy to stand here."
' said he. "unless we ourselves he in
deed and in truth real democrats and
servants of mankind, ready to give
our very lives for the freedom and
justice and spiritual exaltation of the
great nation which stutters and nurtures
us.
! "No more significant memorial could
I have been presented to the nation than
this. It expresses so much of what is
I singular and noteworthy i 11 the his
torv of the country, it suggests so
many of the things that we prize nu t
| highly in our life and in our system
or government.
"We would like to think of men like
Lincoln and Washington as typical
Americans, but no man can be typical
i who is so unusual as these great men
were. It was tynieal of American lifn
that it should produce such men with
j supreme indifference as to the manner
in which it produced them, and as read 1

Secretary Baker announced the or-|

had already ordered to their
home stations, fi.000 regular coast artil- j
lerymen who have been serving as in- 1
fantry on the border.
The secretary's statement said:
"In view of the fact that substantial- '
lv this number of troops who have not
done patrol duty on the border are 1
now on their way there, it is felt that
this number can he spared. In a few
days if transportation facilities remain
undisturbed, the department intends
to order heme some more regiments
and possibly to replace them with
troops now in their mobilization camps
in the several states."
Regiments to be sent home wore not i
designed by number, and it is understood
that their selection is left to

department officials think there is
ample force on the border now to insure
proper protection and with the
Immediate gravity ()f the Mexican situ
