Portland, Ore., Sept. 4. Wool
prices In Oregon this year were the
highest in the history of the state, but
the clip was an unusually light one
and the total income from this source
was smaller than last year's.
Growers who sold when the buying
was keen had no fault to find with the
prices bid. Fronvthe time of the first
sales the tendency of the market was
steadily upward. The advance, how
ever, was not as rapid as some of the
sheepmen anticipated and a greater
number than for many years with
drew their clips from the market.
These wools are still held ln this
state unsold.
As was the case last year the Euro
pean war was the great factor In
strengthening the market, but less
was heard of the war demand than of
the stoppage of needed Importations
from Australia and other countries
from which American manufacturers
have always secured supplies.
As for the future course of the
market, it will depend, of course,
mainly on the duration of the war. If
the conflict should be ended before
the next clip is ready for market, ex
treme wool prices will not be looked
for. However, the trade does not an
ticipate a return of very low values
as wool, In the world's market, in
dependently of war conditions, Is in
a very strong statistical position.
In discussing the past season in
Oregon, Isidor N. Koshland, a leading
local wool buyer, said:
"The wool season of 1916 In Ore
gon was different from any that we
have had for some time. More wool
was privately bought, either by con
tract before shearing time or Just
when sheared, than for some years.
Prices ruled high and any number of
growers were ready to let go and
most of them (except on early con
tracts) did better than those who
held for the regular sales. Then
again, more wool Is left unsold in
Oregon than there has been at this
time of the year since the time of the
panic prices. This was due to high
prices, bullish reports by some news
papers and by persons not connected
with the wool industry and also to the
fact that Oregon had some of the
poorest clips it has had in years.
Growers could not realize that their
clips were not worth the top market.
"The margin between clips ranged
any where from 5 to 7 cents per
pound. Choice wools, what there
were, were generally and readily sold,
and 25 cents and better was paid for
fine wool clips, and up to 30 cents for
the coarse grades.
. "As a whole, the sealed bid sales
could hardly be called a success. At
most points the quantity was small,
and with growers' ideas rather er
treme excepting at Shaniko, where
practically everything was sold, own
ers of hardly halt of the clips offered
accepted bids. These lots are mostly
Btlll 'on hand, held by growers at
country points or consigned to Port
land warehouses. There are prob
ably 600,000 pounds still at central
points and 6,000,000 pounds in Port
land. Of the clips in Portland, quite
a portion were not offered, growers
speculating on the future market.
"The clip ln Oregon was the light
est in the history of the state. The
fleeces averaged fully a pound lighter
than previous years. Any number of
owners cut down their bands or sold
out, and the sheep were Bhipped out
of the state. These sheep sales were
made owing to the attractive prices,
tooth for lambs and aged sheep. With
present conditions continuing and
with the very strong demand for
lambs, we will have only old ewes
left, and with the limited Summer
range, caused by our forest reserve
policy, our sheep Industry will fur
ther decline.
"The generally poor condition of
the wool was caused, first, by the dry
Summer and Fall, the sheep coming
out' of the mountains In a cloud ot
One acre of wheat on the
Ed Hunt ranch south of
Heppner made a yield of six
ty bushels, is the report
brought to town by Tom
Driscoll, Jr., who is sewing
sacks for Mr. Hi:nt.
Mr. Hunt is following the
system of heading and
threshing together and all of
his grain is exceptionally
heavy this year. An acre of
the best of it was marked off,
cut and threshed with the
result of the sixty bushel
yield. Mr. Hunt's average
will not come near this figure
but from present indications
it will produce between 35
and 40 bushels per acre, ac
cording to Mr. Driscoll.
All fields In the south end
are making a better yield
than was predicted before

The Lexington high school building
was completed January 1, 1916, at a
cost of 16,000.
It is a splendid building, is modern
and up to date, with plenty of room
and equipment to offer the very best
of advantages in school work to all
pupils both in the grades and. high
school.
In the basement is the well equipp
ed labratory and manual training
room.
On the first floor are three grade
rooms, teachers' office and domestic
science and lunch room.
On the second floor is one grade
room, two class rooms, library and
the assembly hall. A feature of the
new building is the incline, which
makes going up and down stairs an
easy matter. The building Is steam
heated and electric lighted through
out. School will open September 11, and
we would urge an early enrollment to
secure all the advantages. We are
looking forward to a successful year
of work, and you will aid greatly by
coming in early.

Pendleton Tribune.
Surrounded by a herd of fear-
crazed elk, Judge J. W. Maloney, of
this city, went through a hair-raising
experience during his bunting trip In
Union county. The judge saw an elk
standing on a hill a short distance
away. He cut down below and un
wittingly came upon the whole herd
of 20 or more not 20 feet from where
he stood. He crouched In the brush
under a tree but the animals got his
scent and stampeded. They couldn't
locate him and charged all over the
place in their efforts to discover the
invader. One of them came so close
that the judge says he could have
poked him with the gun. They fin
ally ran off and the judge was re
leased from his Imprisonment.
The party included besides the
judge. Dr. H. S. Garfield and J. F.
Mason of Pendleton and J. F. Nowliu,
former county school superintendent,.
who is visiting here. Mr. Nowlin was
the only one of the party to get a
deer. He brought down a fine five
point buck on the first day and they
thought they would easily be able to
get the limit. The ground was too
dry, however, and there were too
many other hunters in the neighbor
hood so they were forced to content
themselves with the one. They had
meat enough to last through the trip
from that one animal.
They found few birds but were not
watching for them. They went out
from North Powder and hunted in the
section just east of the Grande Ronde
river.
Store Men Catch Real "Bird."
A real "bird" as W. E. Leach called
it, was on exhibition at the Leach
Brothers store in Lexington last Sat
urday. The "bird" was nothing more
or less than a big black tarrantula
which had come into the store by the
banana route. When the bananas
were opened by ope of the clerks, the
huge spider Jumped from his home
among the fruits and went jumping
across the store. Several women were
in the store at the time and from the
reports, they must have jumped about
as fast as the tarrantula. That the
"bird" can jump was evidenced when
he jumped out of a jar before the lid
could be placed thereon.
Walter Luckman of Lena was a
Heppner business visitor today.
Miss Ella Coe has returned to
Heppner for the opening of school
after spending the summer at her
home in Baker. Miss Coe will again
have charge of one of the grades in
the public school.
It cost Chas. Pointer of
Lexington the low price of
three cents and a half per
bushel to harvest his 1916
wheat crop. Mr. Pointer
and J. F. McMillan pur
chased a threshing outfit at
the opening of harvest and
they followed the system of
heading and threshing to
gether. Mr. Pointer figures
he saved ten centh a bushel
by this method for had he
hired his grain harvested he
would have had to pay in the
neighborhood of 13 cents.
There are many advan
tages in the method they
used, according to Mr. Poin
ter. But the main one is the
saving made over the old
method. The Pointer-McMillan
outfit had a four
weeks' run and during the
entire time lost only a half
hour. Mr. Pointer has about
5200 sacks of wheat which is
now being hauled to the
warehouse In Lexington. He
has not yet sold the crop.
SUPT. URGES CLEANING
The farmers are unusually busy
at this season of the year owing to
the lateness of harvest. This Is
apt to result In schools opening with
out any preparation being made. The
schoolhouse should be looked after
and put Into good condition. If any
repairs are needed, they should be
made. The floors should be scrubb
ed, the outbuildings should be clean
ed and the vaults made dark so flies
will not enter them; brooms, floor
brushes, crayon, fuel and other
supplies should be on hand. The
window shades should be In working
order. Many a pupil's eyes have
been permanently Injured by sitting
with the sunlight falling upon his
book. . If new shades are needed,
buy the tan canvas adjustable shades.
They cost a little more, but they
will outlast half a dozen of the or
dinary kind, and are cheaper In the
long run. They also make It possi
ble to regulate the light much bet
ter. The floors should receive a coat
of some kind of oil or dressing.
Then if a little sweeping compound
Is provided, the dust evil will be
lessened. There Is much danger In
the schoolroom dust, and It should be
kept down as much as possible. The
water supply should be well looked
after. Pupils can not do good work
unless they have good water to drink.
Provisions should be made for am
ple ventilation. The board should
see that the teachers and pupils make
good use of the means of ventilation.
If the stove does not have a jacket,
one should be provided. It will be
paid for in better results In study.
Then, by all means, make some pro
visions for introducing moisture Into
the atmosphere of the school room.
It will save fuel, for pupils will be
comfortable at a lower temperature.
It will be of advantage to the eyes,
nose, throat and lungs. It will
make the discipline better. It the
blackboard is gray or shiny, some
thing should be done to put It into
first class condition. A good black
board is a prime essential. A gray
or shiny blackboard Is very trying on
the eyes. Do not buy a lot of un
usuable charts from a traveling
agent. Come to the office and con
sult the catalogue of the furnishing
honses. You will .Instantly save
money. Some districts have bought
excellent charts, but they can not be
used In a rural school where the re
citations must be only ten or fifteen
minutes In length.
I will suggest that the mothers
of the neighborhood visit the school
house and make an inspection of the
premises. The average member of
the rural school board Is a pretty
busy man just now. It might be a
good plan to have a clean up day
some afternoon before school opens.
Many hands make quick work. It
will pay big to have the building
and premises ln good condition be
fore school opens.
Some of the project workers who
have not kept up in all particulars
with the requirements may feel that
It Is not worth while to bring an ex
hibit to the fair. Bring along the ex

premiums for each project or division.
You might win one of the smaller
prizes. But It you do not win you
will help make the exhibit. Then
you will be ready to try harder next
year, when you will understand the
work better. So, If you have some

creditable, bring it in. Look over

Munter Will Be Big At
traction and Town
Will Be Decorated.
From present indications, the 4th
Annual Morrow County Fair will be
greeted by the largest crowd ln its
history, when the doors at the Fair
grounds swing open next Thursday
morning.
Secretary Smead has received com
munications from people ln neighbor
ng cities who announce they are com
ing to the fair and are bringing the
family. In a letter from S. R. Old
aker at Hermiston, Mr. Smead re
ceives the welcome news that a large
number of people are coming over
from the project city. Similar reports
have been received from Echo, Pen
dleton and Pilot Rock. It Is highly
possible that a special train will be
sent over from the Umatilla county
metropolis.
More good news comes from Port
land. The Chamber of Commerce of
that city is making arrangements to
send up a delegation, and in addition
to the usual crowd of former Hepp
nerites who take In the annual event,
the Rose City will be represented by
the largest number that has yet come
to the fair.
Undoubtedly the greatest feature in
the free attraction list will be the
daily flights by Herbert Munter, the
Seattle aviator. Munter has a repu
tation that is nation-wide. His menu
of dips and turns will give the spec
tators a hearty meal of awes and
thrills. Nothing has ever yet been
done In the dizzy heights that Munter
does not do. His Dive ot Death was
never excelled by Lincoln Beachy,
say those who have seen this peerless
aviator perform. Two years ago the
fair board gave Morrow County Fair
visitors their first opportunity to wit
ness the flights of an air navigator.
Silas Christofferson was the first man
to bring an airship into the county.
His flying was of a very conservative
order, although he did not fail to
please his crowds. But Munter has
some thrills not given by Christoffer
son. The board has arranged for lec
tures on dairying, horticulture and
agriculture bv SDeakers who nm snep-
ialists'along these lines. The lectures
win be given in the new city hall,
which will be appropriately fitted up
for the occasion. One of the sneakers
at this time will be F. W. Kehrli of
La Grande, a dairy expert who is a
graduate of the Oregon Agricultural
College and at the present time em-
ployed by the college In Its extension
department.
At a meetine of the business mpr
Tuesday afternoon, It was unanimous
ly decided by those present that the
business district of the city should be
decorated during the fair. At the
present time Secretary Smead Is cor
responding with a Pendleton decora
tor, and It Is probable that he will be
given the contract for decking the
city streets In a systematic and pleas
ing manner.
The city council had planned to
have the streets oiled before the fair,
but they have been unable to secure a
car load of oil at this time, so the
streets will be sprinkled with water.
Chopping Helps Alfalfa.
By chopping alfalfa hay for feed
ing cattle, even after allowing $1.50
per ton for the chopping, the Eastern
Oregon Branch Experiment Station at
Union was able to make gains at the
usual cost and at the same time put
on a little more finish. "The trouble
with the fattening of steers on hay Is
that they often do not get quite fat
enough for market," says Professor
E. L. Potter, in reporting these ex
periments. "If there is any way In
which they can be made to gain just
a little more finish, it will be of im
mense benefit. It woudl seem from
these tests that cutting the hay may
be the solution."

man of Lena, transacted business in
Heppner today.
fered in your line.
Teachers who have not sent their
reports on the reading circle work to
the Extension Division of the Univer
sity and expect to take an examina
tion upon any book should notify the
county superintendent so arrange
ments may be made before their
school opens.
