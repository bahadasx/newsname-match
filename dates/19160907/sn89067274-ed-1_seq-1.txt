records in our Court House among the
best there are.

of Mrs. Sanford's qualifications by
giving her an overwhelming majority.

Col. Burton is arranging to take

see that the boys are properly cared

3,000 STILL ON BORDER
Three Thousand Miasouri Troops Still
on the Border Not Known
When Troops Will Go Home.
NEVADA, Mo, Sept. 6. The
First regiment, national guard of
Missouri, of St Louis, followed the
Third of Kansas City back to Camp
Clark. The First of he two
trains carrying it reached here at 9
o'clock yesterday a. m. and the sec
ond train came in yesterday after
noon. The First regiment is still un
der command of Colonel A. B. Don
nelly, who arrived with the first sec

There are now nearly 2,000 Missouri
troops back at the reservation here.
Three thousand remain at the border
and none of the other units, which in
clude the Second regiment of South
west Missouri and the Fourth of St.
Joseph and the Northwest Missouri,
are expected home soon.
No official information is obtaina
ble as to when the troops sent back
hero will be permitted to return to
their homes. However, the feeling
among the men is that they are like
ly to be here at least 2 or 3 weeks
before the order comes from the war
department to send all the national
guardsmen back to the states from
which they were mustered in.
The men who left here green and un
tutored in military service have
changed. They have now the same
experienced, soldierly bearing as their
fellows who have been in the service
for yars.
Colonel Donnelly, of St. Louis, is
ranking officer, so, far, at the reserva
tion and will be in command unless
other provisions are made.
A great many Kansas Cityans, rel
atives and friends of the members of
the Third, have been here to see the
boys since their return.

ed All are Enthusiastic
A number of members of the Com
mercial Club and others interested in
the success of the big street fair here
this fall met at the Hotel Hoxsey at
6:30 Monday night to further the ar
rangements for the big fall entertain
ment A prize of S2.50 bad been of
fered for the best suggestion of a name
for the street fair. Three names were
submitted and after some debate the
name, "The Annual Corn Show and
Fall Festivities," submitted by Miss
Lulu Price, was chosen and is now the
official name of the fair.
It was announced that the Brund-
age ShowB, which were here last year,
had been again secured under prac
tically the same contract as last year.
A committee of five was appointed by
John Abbay, who presided over the
meeting, to take charge of placing and
arranging the farm exhibits, the mem
bers of this committee are: H. E. C.
Tucker, W. Clyde Johnson, 'Roy Ferris,
Joe Davis and Wm. Rose.
The location of the various shows
was placed in the hands of the ar
rangements committee H. E. C.
Tucker, William Rose and R. E. Race
who are to co-operate with the
street and alley committee of the city
council in locating the various shows.
A decorations committee, composed of
W. Clyde Johnson, Roy Ferris and Roy
Mitchell, was appointed to attend to
decorating the booths and exhibits.
Along this line an attempt will be
made to interest the ladies of Mexico
and of the country in the work of
decorating the booths and exhibits
and also to interest the school chil
dren of the county in this work.
The matter of a poultry exhibit was
brought before the meeting and Sam
Evans was appointed chairman of the
poultry committee and empowered to
appoint his assistants and the associ
ation was ordered to place an amount
not to exceed $50 at his disposal for
poultry prizes.
The committee on arrangement will
work with W. Clyde Johnson, County
School Superintendent in arranging
a number of contests and exhibits by
the school children of the county.
A committee consisting of Charles
Malone, G. W. Nash and Maurice Phil
lip was appointed to consult with the
merchants of the city in regard to the
proposed style show, in which the
merchants will take part The com
mercial club offers to furnish living
models who will display the latest
styles for the merchants. It is plann
ed to have this style show on a large
platform on the square. It is a
unique feature for Mexico, although
it has been tried in other places and
met with great success.
Another feature of the Annual
Corn Show and Fall Festivities, which
should receive strong co-operation of
the merchants is the window decorat
ing contest, the details of which were
left with the arrangements commit
tee. In order that this contest ne
fair to all, the stores entering this
contest are to be divided in to clasae.4,
so a clothing store will not have to
compete against a hardware store,
or a grocery against a shoe store, for
the best dressed window.
The question of the parades and spe
cial features was left to the arrange
ments committee and they promise us
some features as good at the parade
of the nations last year.
A committee of four T. L. Mar
shall, I. M. Richards, John E. Fisn
and Judge W. W. Botts was ap
pointed to interest the railroads in
advertising the enterprise and in of
fering some prizes.
After the business connected with
the Annual Corn Show and Fall Fes
tivities was completed, a resolution
was introduced that the resignation of
Roy Ferris, as presoident of the com
mercial club, be not accepted, and
that he be kindly and respectfully re
quested to serve until the first of the
coming year: this resolution was
adopted without a dissenting vote.
Mr. Ferris has been a very efficient
president and the commercial club is
to be congratulated on this step.
In order to keep up wfth their work
and keep things going all the time,
the various committees connected
with the promotion of the fall enter
tainment agreed to meet every Mon
day evening at 7:30 at the City Hall
and to invite all merchants and busi
ness men of Mexico to attend these
meetings.

PRISON BROOM FACTORY BURNS
Factory Manager Overhears Hint That
Plant waa to be Scene of Blase.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo, Sept 8.
A part of the factory of the Central
Broom Company, operating in the Mis
souri Penitentiary, was destroyed by
fire Tuesday afternoon. The fire
started in the north end of the build
ing in a room which was stored a large
quantity of broom corn and broom
handles. This is the second big fire
within the prison in the last twe
months. The scene of the fire yester
day afternoon was in one of the build
ings in the stockade adjoining the one
burned previously.
The prison fire department was un
able to bring the fire under control,
and the city fire department was call
ed. The convict firemen worked
hard to save the main part of the
building. There were no accidents and
the 1,800 convicts behaved with per
fect discipline while the fire was rag
ing.
There is a suspicion that the tire
was due to incendiarism, and this wiU
be rigidly investigated by Warden D.
C. McClung. It is started that
among the convicts in one of the
adjoining factories the word has been
passed around the convicts a short
time before the fire broke out that
the broom factory was to be the next
building burned. This was said to'
have been overheard by the manager
of the factory, but before he could
warn the prison officers to be on the
lookout the alarm was sounded.
