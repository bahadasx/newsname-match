OFFICERS OF TROOP H.
MAKE STATEMENT ON
CONDITIONS IN CAMPS
Tho following communication which
bears the approval of every member
of troop H, In which the non-commissioned
ofilcers took tho solo Initia
tive, has been received and Is self
explanatory;
Nogales, Arizona,
August 31, 1916.
Commercial Boosters Club,
Logan, Utah.
Gentlemen:
Inasmuch as various fulse Impres
sions ns to conditions existing in our
camp may have been conveyed to you
and our good people at homo by ru
mors and reports from different sourc
es, a committee has been appointed
by tho non-commlBsloned officers or
troop H, Fiist Utah Cavalry, N. 0.
U. S. to mako a statement, the pur
pose or which Is to correct any mis
understanding that now exists among
our rrlends and who nro particularly
Interested In tho welfare and pro
gress of troop H.
First, ns to our welfaro: We wish
to nssuro ytu that tho health or tho
boys is excellent, nnd for somo time
our dally sick report has shown no
thing worso than a very fow minor
ailments, in fact it is becoming a
raro thing among us when one of our
number Is too ill to report for duty.
Tho conveniences and sanitary con
ditions in our camp are all that could
bo desired. In a recent official In
spection of all camps in tho Nogales
district the Inspectors found that in
every camp tho percentage or sick
was In ratio to tho sanitary condi
tions and files. Utah Cavalry waH
mentioned In the report as having
tho second best sanitary condition In
this district. We are proud to re
port troop II Is the standard in both
Utah squadrons for sanitation, which
is n feature of primary consideration
Intho army.
Generally speaking, the spirits of
the troopers are about as good as
they would be under any conditions
in army life. True It is often discour
aging to ono who, as a civilian, has
been accustomed to entire personal
liberty, to have those liberties denied
him to a great extent In order to con
form to practices and regulations es
sential to tho morale and success of
things military; and our having to
make somo of theso sacrifices Is in
a large measure responsible for the
most of tho unpleasant and rebellious
moments that some of us havo ex
perienced. Our cduntrylios set its hand, in
conformity to public opinion, to in
crcaso tho size and efficiency of Us
nrmy and everyono realizes, or should
reallzo, that this can only bo accom
plished at the sacrifice, and cost or
Its citizens. Our inccntlvo to help
to do this .s and Is patriotism and
we maintain that It is a mighty cheap
brand of patriotism that Is stilled and
grows cold with tho fow burdens we
havo thus far had to carry. Wo are
convinced that tho commanders nro
doing what they can to make our
time profltablo and Interesting and
that their ambition is to return us
to our homes, when ordered to do so,
far bettor prepared to dofenit those
homes and our country than whon
they brought us away. Further, Cap
tain Wooley's interest In his troop Is
unusual, and ho is, thank tho Lord,
almost over anxious about our sani
tation nnd cleanliness, thoroughness,
deportment and morals. Our' captain
hod net had a great deal or military
,oxporienco prior to his assuming the
command of troop H. However the'
keon Interest he has shown, the
strict discipline ho has oxcrclsed and
persistent attention to our work, hns
placed troop H .known ns tho young
est troop In both squadrons, ranking
among tho best In every feature of
tho program in which wo, havo thus
far participated. In many things we
set tho pace. This Is not said boast
ingly but merely to correct falso im
pressions and misunderstandings
about us, which, wo understand are
scattered broadcast in Logan,
What wo need from homo Is boosts
not discouragement, Wu appreciate
deeply tho kind Interest )ou are tak
ing in us nnd wo slncoroly thank you
for tho generous assistance you have
(iiiiwjMiHiipiiiiii,Miiiiiiiiin)Hiniiwi.ienyiiBw
' V,v
.given us, and we feel'eiiro that you
wiil do all ou eon to help enlist more
of the aome boys to come down horo
and Join us nd fill up our ranks and
make troop it, absolutely representa
tive" of jLbgnn and Cache County, and
cortalnly there are n great many who
can Afford to comb fully as well as
some who are here.. Wo want Caem
Countyjboys because we know they
arethcPTlght sort, und we feel that
it will be k fine thing for all of us
to recruit the Woop to rull strength
with treoprfri who will stay together
after we return from border patrol
duty, nnd continue to maintain troop
II as Bn organization of merit upon
which Uncle Sam can rely in cac6 ot
necessity.
Wo offer as Inducements to pros
pective recruits the best camp on
t-he bordrr, Ideal climate, beautiful,
clean and interesting natural bu
roundlngs plenty or water nnd a good
bath house, new spacious screened
mess hall and kitchen, in Tact they
will get comturts and conveniences
which havo only been made possible
by 'great expenditures of money nnd
a good deal of hard labor on tho part
of us who came first. Add to this
their obligation to their country and
Logan's especial interest in the main
tenance of troop H, and you should
find argument enough to supply us
with a Oozcn or so recruits wo so
badly ncd.
Troop hi, is our troop and wo are
proUd Oflt. We arc going to boost
It, and If this letter serves to bring
about .ar closer cooperation between
tho fo)ktJiomo and their boys on
tho border and to quieten somo mis
chievous tongues and quell criticism
which Is tending to Injure rather than
assist us, it will have accomplished
that for which It was written.
Very truly tours,

MORRIS VERY
POPULAR AS
A CANDIDATE
Josao Cannon, sales agent in Utah
for Uncle Jesse Knight's coal, hns
beon in Uigan this week. Mr. Can
non, was one of the original support
ers of Nophl I,. Morris for the nomi
nation of governor on the Republican
ticket and he says now that he mado
no mistake for ho getH assurances
from every quarter of tho state that
ho vlBits regularly, that Mr. Morris
is a very popular candidate.
Mr. Morris lg n young man with
nbtllty. Ho is n representative of tho
plonoer blood which first populated
this stato. He Is clean morally and
has been lighting for u clean nnd
wholesomo atmosphere for tho young
men und women or this state oven
before ho over became u candidate
for office, it was he who first start
ed tho agitation for stato wldo pro
hlbltion. Ho supported this Issue be
fore It was a popular one. His only
interest was to give to tho parents
that protection which thoy s0 much
desire in bohalf or their ramilles and
the protection tho young men and
young women or this state so much
uoed.
Now that prohibition Is practically
tho only Issue In this campaign In
tho Stato or Utah, there is no man
better fitted to accopt tho responsi
bility or carrying to a successful con
clusion a policy ror which ho has, a
stale wido reputation for supporting
for tho post ten years.
Tho reassurances are bo general
relative to tho good feeling manifest
for Hon, Nephl L. Morris, that the
prediction Is that ho will get ono of
tho biggest majorities ovor given n
candidate tor olllco in Utah.
