THINGS DOING
IN THE FIFTH DIS

Comrade Debs is off to Colorado for
a little rest prior to his great cam

control of the government versus cap
italist^class control of the govern
ment", this, I gather from conversa
tions with Comrade Debs, will be the
main issue that he will bring before
the wealth-producers of his district.
The questions of war and "Prepared
ness" will, of course, come in for their
share of the general discussion.
Meanwhile a great deal of prelim
., mary work is being done by competent
speakers and organizers.
The campaign mangers have dis
covered in Comrade L. M. Rector an
organizer of unusual ability, and he is
• doing splendid work in the rural dis
£ tricts * and the smaall towns. From
. now on he will devote his entire time
to the campaign. „
In Putnam county we have an effic
ient worker in Comrade Fred B. Clear
water, and he will have charge, also, of
the organization work in Hendricks
County.
Comrade Vincent Verde, who has a
splendid record as organizer and pro
. _ paganist among Italians, has been del
egated to bring all of the sons of Italy
' into the Socialist camp. He will visit
•very Italian colony within the Fifth
~.-;-;. District, organizing and teaching.
»j*jSi|£f Ajhl that valiant but amiable war
rior Rev. James H. Hollingsworth, who
V"';;. has already 'accomplished much, will
p continue his activties among the farm
.,■ ers ' until 'he shall have covered the
whole District more than once.
*j. A novel method of propaganda for
the campaign, designed especially to
reach those who imagine they are not
-—-interested in Socialism, ft that of Com
rade Charles L. Drake, who will give
a number of moving picture lectures
in the District, using, the regular
"movie" .houses and their audiences.
His entertainment is very highly re
commended by Locals who have en
gaged him and know the quality of his
work.
The writer will give his stereopticon
lecture, "The Impending Crisis," in all
Locals where electricity is available,
and campaign talks in a number of
others, besides holding many out-door
meetings.
400000 TRAINMEN WKKST THE
EIGHT-HOUR DAY FROM MAGNATES
Biggest Single Victory Won By Organized Labor
From Organized Capital By Standing
Solidly Together
Having whipped the railroad mag
mites to Standstill, the 400,000 train
men of the United States have, thro
ugh the force of their solid organiz
ation, wrested the eight-hour day from
tho barons without submitting the
principle to the sbani "arbitration"
proceedings suggested by the heads of
the roadl m an effori »<> job the work
ers.
Not only does this mark the biggest
single victory ever won by organized
labor from organized capital, but it
also has far reaching significance for
the entire industrial world. Those that
can foresee the hand writting on the
wall declare that the sight-hour day
will soon become the universal stand
ard for the work day in all trades.
The surrender of the railroads came
reluctantly, and only after the Presi
dent of the United States had vig
orously informed them that the men's
eight-hour day demand was not only
reasonable, but their just due, that
the public was behind tho move, and
that it simply would have to be grant
ed. The sixty railroad presidents who
had been conferring with President
Wilson after their managers had vir
tually to admit they had no power to
settle the matter finally, did submit
some qualifications to the concessions
which will be referred to a commis
sion for adjustment. > But the yital
fact that the eight-hour day with
ten hours' pay has been granted the
men.
Leaders of the "Big Four" brother
hoods of the trainmen who also con
ferred with the President at his re
quest, and who stuck to their ulti
matum of "eight hours with ten hours
pay without arbitration, or we strike,"
have shown marvelous restraint thro

union workers on the railroads author-

the magnates to have the whole mat

the workers refused to consider such

would have taken years, after which

use it for that purpose.
Labor has once more got what it
voted for. Nothing of any value to
labor has been passed unles it be the

THE
THINKLETS
liy W. E. REYNOLDS.
"Wage earners could not exist with
out Cfipitalists" Says the stand patter
ami the apologist for things as Ihey
are. And it is title.
"Capitalists {'(Mid not exist without
wage earners" reply the reformers.
This, is also tin .
The greater truth Is that neither
wage-earner noij Capitalist is neces
sary In a sane world. Both ought to
be, .'lllll can bo aflblished.
An industrial Republic, founded up
on social ownership of social neces
sities will nbolisj) the Capitalist (as a
capitalist) by (halting it impossible
for him to get "the benefits arising
from private ownership of socially
necessary raw materials and tools of
production, and Will at the same time
abolish the wage-earner (as a wage
earner) by making it. possible for the
worker to receive the social equivalent
of the product of his labor.
*, * *
Capital and wage-labor are two sides
of the same system of slavery.
*, * *
All hail king Mortgage the great
est emancipator of them all. With him
around one is almost certain of free
dom FROM property!
I * *
The Feudal Lord insisted upon the
"Right of the first night" as his own.
The modern Land Lord goes him sev
eral better. HE insists on the right
to use the little daughters of his ten
ants as soon as they are able to toddle
to the cotton patch—and out of their
earnings the modern Landlords main
tain whole harems of young girls who
under modern methods are denied the
opportunity of ever having a marriage
of their own.
* * *
The high sounding phrases of the
politician do not 'fit-in' with the piti
ful reality which everywhere confronts
him. Yes, verily the lot of the politi
cian is hard and we workers are mak
ing it a lot harder. On with the good
work.
* * *
The demand for equality among
equals isJ not Jinjted to political rights
but extends to industrial needs as well.
* * *
On a socially operated farm the seed
expert and the soil expert determines
beforehand the crop and the seed best
adapted to a particular soil. On the
privately owned or operated farm, the
farmers guess on the seed and the kind
of crop, and then have to wait till the
crop matures (or fails to mature) in
order to find out whether or not they
have made a good guess.
* * *
Social production in agriculture, as
in other fields of production would
largely eliminate the loss of crops and
labor due to too much or too little rain
in spots. Today the rain and the
drouth falls alike on the 'just and the
unjust' and its rather tough on the
'just' who thereby suffer from Nat
ure's seeming streak of cussedness.
But Nature isn't cussed. When man

Nature instead of suffering from her
laws. No one hase solved a scheme of
outwitting her. A mortgage is rain

The Capitalist can not exist without
constantly revolutionizing the means
of production and that has its influ
ence upon the relationship of the
whole of society. Under these condi
tions it is some task to make ideas of
the worker "stay out."

The threatened railroad strike has
brought out one point good and strong
and clear, and that is the acknowledg

Power that the Workers potentially
possess.

Heraclitus one of the earlier Greeks
(B. 0.) said "Nothing remains, what,

lack of ideas of the modern school of
stand-political stagnation.

CO-OPERATION IN ITALY
Within eighteen years co-operation
has made an advance in Italy in many
ways more fascinating than the story
of the airship. Small farmers co-op
eratively manufacture their own fer
tilizers. They run co-operative banks,
farms and market gardens. The com
monest sort of labor hires engineers,
buys material and pays its own bills
from its own co-operative banks. It
pavea streets, dredges land, builds all
manner of structures, even to the Reg
gio Emillia Railroad.
This work now runs into many mil
lions of lira la lire \a worth about 20
cents). The government and cities
are organically committed to a work
ing partnership with these co-opera
tors.

Tactics of Old Parties
liy ALLAN L. HENKON.
The New York World, which is now
daily hammering Hughes, prints a lead
ing editorial entitled "Is Hughes An
other Parker?" Parker, The World
explains, was nominated in 1904 to
"get rid of liryun," and Hughes was
nominated to "get rid of Roosevelt."
Parker's nomination, which appealed
to nobody outside of Wall street, re
sulted in his overwhelming defeat, and
The World wonders whether Wall
street's nomination of Hughes will not
result likewise.
The World may find much pleasure
in speculating along this line." If The
World wishes to engage in some spec
ulaion worth while let it ask and pon
der over thin question I "Is Wilson an
other Roosevelt?"
ROOSEVELT WAS DECOY.
Roosevelt, in 1914, beat Parker.
WliiU. good did it do the people of the
United States to have Roosevelt
elected ? Roosevelt was the political
faker then that he is now, only most
people did not know it.
Roosevelt, in 1!)!(!, is a traitor to the
Progressive party, but he was always
a traitor to the farmers, wage-work
ers and others who do the country's
real work.
Roosevelt won a lot of paper victo
ries for the workers but he never
stood for a thing that did them any
real good, and in 1909, he left the
country in great industrial distress.
What better is Wilson? What has
he ever done for the working class?
What does he know" about working
class problems? In 1912, Wilson said
the working class needed a lower
tariff. Now he says the working class
needs a higher tariff.
WILSON FAILS WORKERS.
After Mr. Wilson gave the working
class a lower tariff, times were bad
and the most of living was no lower.
Though the greater part of Wilson's
program had been put into effect, the
country was in a deplorable state of
indusrial depression until the Euro
pean war dumped $3,000,000,000 of
war orders into America and abso
lutely compelled business to revive.
We now have what Mr. Wilson calls
"great prosperity." We now have
everything in the way of legislation
that Mr. Wilson promised us and a
great deal more "prosperity" than he
ever dared to offer. The steel trust
has just announced the record profits
for the last quarter of more than
$80,000,000 Is the country happy?
Has it reason to be content? Are the
steel workers rolling in wealth.
TIMES ARE HARD.
The steel workers are not rolling in
wealth. They are working like the
very mischief for a bare living. Their
wages are "high" as the wages of
steel workers go, but they are low
when measured at the grocery. The
SHINGLE WEAVERS
HAVE NEW MARKET
PLAN FOR PRODUCT
An entirely new plan of pushing
union label goods and at the same time
proving to the employer that by hand
ling such products he can make more
money than otherwise, has just been
started by the International Shingle
Weavers' Union, with headquarters in
Seattle, throughout the Pacific North
west.
Union officials have just signed a
contract with one of the largest shin
gle companies under which a nation
wide campaign will be started to ad
vertise and sell Washington shingles
produced by union labor. The firm is
the Lester W. David Lumbed Com
pany.
The concern agrees to become the
selling agent for all mills that will
use the union shingle weavers' union
label. It will conduct a systematic
selling campaign, while the union on
the other hand will conduct a similar
campaign among the quarter of a mil
lionunion carpenters in the country,
urging them to buy only these union
label shingles.
Officials of the union regard this
new featuiv as epoch-making in the
industry, for never before has any
broad effort been made to appeal to
the purchasing power of union labor
through the use of the label in this
trade.
Heretofore there were no means of
identification on the shingle, as J. G.
Brown, president of the International
Union, pointed out. Brown has al
ready begun his part of the work by
writing to international officers of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters to
secure their co-operation. Anton
Johannsen, of the brotherhood, and
widely known Western labor leader,
has promised to bring the matter up
at the national convention of his or
ganization, which will meet in Fort
Worth, Tex., in September.
high cost of living; eats up everything
I that the workers get. This applies to
I all workers, steel workers included.
What is the matter? Has Mr. Wil
son any remedy for such a situation ?
Should the American people elect him
again to get a remedy? The Demo
cratic platform gives no hint that any
remedy is needed.
The Democratic platform gloats
over the "marvelous prosperity" that
has come to us. According to the
Democratic party we now have noth
ing to do but to he happy. We have
nothing of which to complain. We
have nothing to fear but the possible
election of Mr. Hughes.
IS FOOLS TALK.
That kind of talk is fine fodder for
fools. A prosperity that means bil
lions for a few and a bare living for
the rest is a pretty poor kind of pros
perity. That is the Wilson kind. It is
also the Hughes kind. They both stand
for the capitalist class. Wilson stands
for the medium-sized capitalists.
Hughes stands for the biggest ones.
Neither one of them has the slightest
notion that most of the world need
ever expect anything better than a
chance to work.
Work is exceedingly poor stuff out
of which to make happiness. The
fruit of work is the stuff out of which
happiness is made. This fruit the
working class does not get. It gets
only enough to keep it alive and work-
I ing. The capitalist class gets the rest.
We Socialists protest against this
sort of "prosperity." We believe the
man who works should get the value
of what he makes. We do not rejoice
at the $80,000,000 of profits that the
steel trust, in three months, wrung
from the steel workers.
LABOR NEEDS PROSPERITY.
If we were in power, the steel work
ers would have that $80,000,000. Judge
Gary, head ef the trust, wh« was trav
eling in the orient when the dividend
was announced, would not have drawn
a dividend of a cent. We do not be
lieve in pay for idlers.
How much do you hate us for that?
How foolish are we because we so be
lieve? How much would you censure
us for building factories and giving
employment to the people? How
much would you denounce us for sell
ing to the people, at cost, what the
people made in their own factories?
How much would you fear such an ad
ministration if you had the power to
recall, at any time, even the president
and also had the power, by your own
direct votes, to make laws and repeal
laws ?
These are the things for which So
cialism stands. Never mind what the
grafters say Socialism stands for. The
grafters do not tell the truth. They
have reasons for not telling the truth
They must lie to keep their grafts.
TRAINMEN REFUSE TO
MOVE STRIKEBREAKERS
WORCESTER, Mass.—A splendid
example of working class solidarity
was evinced by trainmen of the Bos
ton and Albany road here when they
absolutely refused to handle a carload
of imported strikebreakers who were
on their way from Boston to New York
where they were to be held in readi
ness for the impending second street
car strike, which has just been averted.
The local railroad men categorically
refused to switch the car onto another
track, or have anything at all to do
with forwarding the cargo of finks.
The car reached here shackled to a
regular passenger train, and it was
intended to send it over the New Hav
en road on to New York.
The yardmaster's force ordered the
car tied onto another train to take it
over to the New Haven tracks. To a
man, switchmen, brakemen and others
on train duty balked at aiding in the
nefarious business of providing strike
breakers for their fellow workers in
New York City.
Just at present railroad managers
are chary of antagonizing the railroad
men. Word was wired to Boston that
the road crew refused to handle the
car. Back came a telegram ordering
the return of the car filled with strike
breakers to Boston.
The car went back. If it ever reach
ed New York with the finks at all, it
certainly did not do so with the aid of
the loyal Worcester railroad workers,
who imperiled their jobs rather than
aid in an attempt to break a strike of
the street car men in New York.
Numerous "sales" indicate that bus
iness people don't believe in the work
ers saving. If they did they wouldn't
advertise to induce them to spend.

THREE INNOCENT
IRISHMEN KILLED
WITHOUT TRIALS
Hearing on Executions Reveals Men
Were Not Aware of Approaching
Death.
With no blindfold and unpinioned
and without being given time to pray,
three innocent men were shot to death
without trial during the last rebellion
in Ireland it developed at an official
inquiry.
The men were not even aware they
were going to their death.
The cases are those of F. Sheehy
Skeffington, Fred Mclntyre, and
Thomas Dickson. The men were put
to death on orders of Capt. Bowen-
Colthurst, who was court-martialed
and found guilty, but insane.
Sergt. Aldridge, who was present at
the shooting, detailed the executions
at the hearing.
The attorney general for Ireland re
lated incidents of the revolution and
of the arrest of Skeffington.
After his arrest Skeffington, the at
torney-general stated, said he was not
a Sinn Feiner, but was in sympathy
with the organization.
The next morning continued the
witness, Skeffington and his compan
ions were taken from the guard room
and executed.
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
FLOODED WITH SPEECHES
THAT WERE NEVER MADE
Although leaders knew that a quor
um of members was not in Washing
ton, the point of "no quorum" was not
raised in the house when consent was
asked to devote an hour to requests for
"leave to print," which means permis
sion to congressmen to insert in The
Congressional Record prepared speech
es that were never delivered.
In that half hour requests came in a
steady flow. The "leave-to-print" ar-
rangement has the great advantage of
enabling a congressman to have his
fake "speeches'! sent free.through the
mails. Owing to the rise in the price
of paper, however, he will pay about
16% cents more for printing this year
than previously.
Some members of the house insisted
on actually delivering their speeches.
They spoke to benches almost empty.
There were 8 of the 435 representa
tives on the floor when the last speech
was delivered.
PULMAN COMPANY
GRATEFUL TO STRIKE
BREAKING CAPTAIN
CHICAGO, 111.—The Pullman Comp
any is still grateful to the men who
aided in the slugging of the employes
in the great pullman strike here in
1894, and who, by their head-clubbing
tactics, helped the company to break
that strike. It showed its apprecia
tion here the other day when it put at
the disposal of Police Captain Cronin,
who is accused in connection with the
vice investigation, its own lawyer, F.
L. Flake, formerly a municipal judge.
In doing this the Pullman Company
expressed to Captain Cronin its grati
tude for the "able work." that the lat
ter did in the big strike. This "able
work," of course, cosisted in terror
izing and shooting the hapless strikers
Cronin has come to grief just now,
however, despite his "noble" strike
breaking record. It is alleged that
in the Kensington district he accepted
protection money from owners of
gambling houses who had "slot ma
chines in operation at their establish
ments.
In order to help Cronin bolster up
his defense on this charge, the Pull
man company offered him the serv
ices of its own attorney.
THE MEXICAN SITUATION
By E. C. HUNTON
How the "patriots" do spout; how
the preachers sing and shout and the
boodlers and the grafters kneal in
prayer! With the Generals and their
thugs they try to drive the workers
bugs by pumping them with bumcomb
and hot air. They would have the toil
ers go far away to Mexico, there to
"save their dear old country from dis
grace." But the workers now are
wise; they can see without their eyes
that the thing is but a humbug on its
face. There is William Randolph
Hearst who has done his very worst
o gobble everything there was in sight
but the "greasers" got a gun and soon
had William on the run. That makes
William want the rest of us to fight.
Then there's Mr. Johnnie Dee who is
sadly up a tree, and it makes him fret
and fume and faunch and boil. He
would have the working class play the
stupid long-eared ass and whoop and
fight and die for Standard Oil. They
have gobbled all the soil, all the timber
and the oil;they have gobbled all the
miner&ll and the sand. And now they
fain would take every "greaser" at
the stake for fighting 'cause they've
gobbled all the land.
