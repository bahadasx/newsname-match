VOL. XXXI. KINGSTREE, SOUTH CAROLINA, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 19R NO. 27
i
MANNING WILL WIN
DECLARES TILLMAN.
URGES 25,000 WHO DIDN'T VOTE
AUGUST 29 TO CAST BALLOT
NEXT TUESDAY.
A special from Columbia to the
News and Courier Monday, says:
"Woodrow Wilson will be re-elected
President of the United States
next November and Richard I Manning
will be renominated Governor
next Tuesdav." said Senator B R
Tillman this afternoon as he was
leaving for his home at Trenton,
after spending the day in Columbia.
The Senator says he is enjoying
fine health and he appears to be in
the best of spirits. He left Washington
about two weeks ago and
since that time has been resting on
his farm at Trenton. He says that
he does not expect to return to the
National Capital until next Decerntber.
While speaking of the South Carolina
race for the Governorship, he
was extremely emphatic and the
old-time battle fire gleamed in his
eye. He says that Blease will probbly
get a small percentage of the
Cooper vote, the remainder going tc
Governor Manning.
jtfeV > "There is not a bit of use to get
'^5. stampeded." said Senator Tinman.
"If the people do as I expect and
*- JM^' think they will Blease will never be
elected." He felt sure the people
when once aroused would go to the
fj* ballot box, and if they did he was
satisfied Manning would be nomi
R nated.
He claims that there are fully 25,
000 enrolled voters that did not ge
to the polls last Tuesday but that i1
they have the good of the State al
^ heart, they will vote against Blease
in the next primary. And he is
firmly of the opinion that they will
"The good Lord has nothing
against South Carolina," said the
Senator, "and he will not let a mar
like Blease again be Governor ol
South Carolina. But the Lord helps
those who help themselves, and it it
up to the voters to get out and give
an emphatic victory to Governoi

It's no use to mention the candidates
who have been here lately.
That would not be news,for they are
swarming everywhere. However, we 1
were surprised to see Supt Gasque
in town Monday, as he was overwhelmingly
nominated last week.
Suppose he is looking to 1920. c

He told his mother he was going to

In fact he went to see his"best girl"

At Dillon Tuesday in the nip-and- c
tuck pennant series between the Dil- *
Ion and Lamar teams for the cham- ^
pionship of the Pee Dee league, Dil- ]
Ion captured the last game of the 1
series by a great streak of luck. Up c
to Tuesday the teams were even, 1
each having won three games. At r
the opening of the last half of the "
ninth inning of the seventh and last '
game everything seemed to be in s
Lamar's favor, when the Dillon boys 1
woke up and made four scores, de- 1
feating the Lamar team 4 to 3. J
Each of the three games won by
Lamar was pitched by Epting. Foster

GO AHEAD WITH SHOW.
At a meeting of the Executive
ommittee of the Williamsburg

lave been in doubt as to whether
he committee would attempt to
told a fair this fall. This idea was
inmistakably dispelled at the meetng
Saturday, for every officer and
nember of the Executive committee
ras enthusiastically in fayor of "gong
right ahead just as if nothing
lad happened." And they ordered
hat additional stalls for stock be
tuilt and a building erected espea.lly
for the poultry exhibit. Other
mprovements were ordered made
o the grounds and buildings.
Indications are that the fair this
all, November 8, 9, 10 and 11, will
txceed in size and interest that of
ast year.
