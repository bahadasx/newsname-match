The Gcrmtn tnd Nr. Hughes
No word of censure has come
froinjthe lips of President Wilson
for our splendid American citizens
uf German birth for exercising the
keenest interest in the welfare Jiofj
kin and friends as they struggle
i nnd suB'er in the trenches for the
! Fatherland. They couldn't help it
1 if they would, Ttiey would Oe de
void of heart if they did. They ,
ure loyal to their adopted country 1
and in a crisis w ul I folio y th-; I
flart as they have aljuys followed '
jit. no matter the toe. President i
! Wilson exacts no other test.1. ,
; l.And yet we are told that some
ol our Ger.iiun citizens nr not
pleased with Mr Wilsns foreign
! policy and will vote for Mr.' Hughes. ;
' flr. R.jasevelt is u !. i npug i- ,
- ing Maine for Mr. Hughes, whose1
; cause he did tint espouse until alter
, a serious c mfere.i'je. tuu o ri li i ite
itiude it plain that he was in abso
lute accord with hi tn (Roosevelt) !
' on all public questions. It is said
that it was even asiree.1 at this c-.n-!
I'erence that in case of Mr. Huglies
: election. Mr. R io--ve:t sh-eild h
made Secretary of St.ite. ..
And here .s Aiia: -Ir. Ro.s.-vel'
, concerning the G'-r:u.i is in tiis
first .speech in Maine, at l.ewistown
Auiiiist HI. 101(5.
"1; is our high and solemn duty.
Ii'ith to prepare our ..vn strent:i
si-as to guarantee niro-vn safety,
ana also to treat ev. rv f ir.-i-'n na
t ion. in uny given crisi-. as as con
duct in that crisis demands. The
citizen vvho does not so act. an I
who endeavors to shape America's
pcWcy in the inter v of tin- coun
try from which lie or Ins ancestors
have sprung, is no true American
and has no moral tight to citizen
ship in this country It is because
of such rn-tinn that I condemn tho-e
professional Germ in Americans
who in our politics act as servants
and allies of Germany, not in
i Americans interested solely in the
'honor and welfare of America".
' Mr. Roosevelt indicts the German
!of this country and condemns them
as traitors without a hearing, with-
out trial He alone is the judge of
I their loyalty
Unless Mr. Hiuhes entertained
the same views Mr. Roosevelt
would not be speaking for him in
Maine.
Are the Germans uoina to vote
for Mr Roim-velt's candidate for
the presiden- y ' Bulletin.
Chautauqua For 1917

ahead with number of tickets
pledged and number of guarantors
in fact, some refused to serve on
the hoard under the circumstances
It was suggested that possibly an
organization of business men could
be made that would take the mat
ter uo and A. Jaeger, Jr., E. A.
Thompson and W. B. Fuhy were op-
pointed to ascertain if such an or
ganization could he made.
The board met again and re
ported that an organization ot ten
or fifteen men ctuld be made and
that it would assume all responsi-
biltiesof putting on the Chautau
qua next year. With this under
standing the chautauqua board
voted to discontinue its efforts and
leave the matter to the business
mens organization. We are expect
ing to have the best chautauqua
next year that we have ever had.
Miss Mattie Fields went
