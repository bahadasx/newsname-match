through the aid of strike breakers.

T
LATEST lid
IT IS RUMORED THERE WILL BE
ANOTHER RICHMOND IN FIELD
FOR THE LITTLE JOB OF MAYOR
NEXT SPRING.
Say, have you heard?
Well, several citizens who have their
ears to the ground and their fingers
on the political pulse have not only
heard, but they have felt a fluttering
that seems to spell the fact that one
John H. Carlock is going to have his
Panama in the ring and his beaming
personality all over the place when
it becomes time for the citizens to
select another mayor for this great
and glorious city.
Mr. Carlock is not going to pine
away for want of companionship in
this little Marathon. There are nut
less than half a dozen others who
have their optics glued to this little
situation, and there are others who
may decide that they, too, will get in
while the getting is good, before the
date for closing the nominations rolls
around.
Mr. Carlock recently resigned as
city engineer, giving as his reason
that the duties devolving upon him
as secretary of the county election
board were all that he cared to take
care of at this time, but the wise ones
seem to think that he resigned with
a double purpose that of attending to
the above mentioned duties and also
laying plans to get himself elected as
mayor of this city. .
Mr. Carlock Is an able man. He
has been fighting in the ranks of dem-
ocracy for a long time, and his friends
would be pleased to see him elected ta
this position. In the meantime, he
says' nothing, with an eloquent grin
when the matter Is broached to him.
