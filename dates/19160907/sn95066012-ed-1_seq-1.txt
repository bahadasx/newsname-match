Senator
THEN GETS AFTER MR. PAGE
Tells Him That His Public Career
Has Been Used To Help His
Business.
Hon. C. S. Pago,
Hyde Park, Vt.
Dear air: My attention has been
called to your public challenge, "Had
you been a Senator of the United
States, would you have voted for the
Rural Credits Hill?" Yes, Senator
Page, I would have voted for the bill,
because I believe In such a law.
I am not now and do not expect In
the future to be engaged in any busi
ness which would be affected by such
a law; because i am not seeKing iu
obtain control of the savings of
widows, orphans and dependents for
the purpose of my own personal gain.
Were 1 so engaged, I should have
voted for the law, because I believe
the Rural Credits Law will benefit and
hel'p to develope portions of the coun
try which need such development,
that the people of Vermont will not
In any way be injured, and that, on
the contrary, such a law will be of
distinct benefit to our agricultural in
terests, and moreover because it is
legislation in the interest or the many
.rather than for the few. a principle
which In my public career I have
steadily borne in mind. Your record
In the Senate does not justify a simi
lar statement.
I might ko further and Btatc for
your Information that I believe pres
ent conditions in Mexico are a men
ace to the best Interests of our coun
try, and should be definitely changed
now and for all time. I believe in
the proper regulation of Public ser
vice corporations and in the condition
of preparedness which will command
respect of all nations. 1 believe In
constructive legislation for the pro
tection of the Interests of the common
people against the few, and my rolCfl
would have be n beard in the Senate
during this crisis In our Country's his
tory, and I would have been found
standing for something and some
where. You, Senator, would have had no
doubt where and for what 1 stood.
When 1 entered this campaign I
stated that "I am more ready to take
this step because It will enable we to
emphasize various Issues anil publlt
policies for which I have always itood
and still stand. I am influenced in
reaching this decision by my belief
that such decision will not meat the
approval of paid lobbyists, big Inter
ests or such newspapers as may sua
tain them. These elements have per
slstently conducted a campaign of
misrepresentation against the con
structive legislation enacted by tin
Oenernl Assembly of 1913, and my
administration as Governor, and for
reasons which appeal to them, stand
today energetically and vociferously
demanding the reelection of the
Junior senator."
In view of tho alignment and char
acter or your supporters. I was most

lime in the last four years, a mans
life has been the loll exacted in the
aeronautical exhibition in connection
with the Butland fair. Yesterday
Samuel A. Libbey of Boston dropped
100 feet, when his fourth parachute
failed to open, following the first as
cension of the 'afternoon in a hot air
balloon, the man being dashed to al
most instant death on the stairs lead
ing to the piazza at the home ol .Mr.
ind Mrs. B. 11. Miner of No. 1C2
Phillips avenue, a few hundred feet
north of the lair grounds.
Four years ago Gecrrgo Schmitt ot
this city was killed following the fall
of his bi-plane while making an exhibi
tion Iliglit with J. Dyer Spellnian as a
passenger. Mr. Llbbcy was 44 years
old and is survived by two sisters. Ho
was never marrieu.
Although the accident was witness
ed by but a very lew persons, those
in a position to see the parachute
jumper as he was descending could
plainly see that the lust parachute
would not have time lo open. Mr.
Libbey went to the judges stand just
before 3 o'clock and asked for assist
ancc in keeping the balloon down
while being lilled.
Tlie ascension started just about 3
o'clock and according to 'I'. H. Flower,
manager of the Boston painting and
Decorating Balloon company of Bos
ton, who was superintending the bal
loon act, Libbey was between 2500
and 8000 feet In the air when lie cut
loose from the big gas bag.
The first parachute dropped rapidly
for fully 00 feet before It gracefully
opened and the aviator floated for
several seconds before cutting loose
into the second parachute and then
into the third. The fourth and last
parachute was blue In color and Mr.
Libbey was only about 150 feet from
the ground when he cut loose for the
final drop.
The parachute did not have time to
open and the man dropped with a
crash into the steps of the house on
Phillips avenue. It is very evident
that he saw his peril loo late. for
when the man was being dashed to
certain death he was making a vain
attempt to open the parachute which
only could save his life. Ills speed
!n. w ever increased and ..Mr. Libbey
came bead foremost Into the wooden
dep.
He gasped but once or twice and be
fore assistance arrived he was dead.
