ANTI-BLEASE MEN,
DO YOUR DUTY
The Bamberg Herald has realized all along that nothin
we could say editorially can or will change any votes i
the primary elections as between the Blease and ant:
Blease factions. As fho situation stands tnriav fJolo "Rlpas
is already defeated. More than eight thousand majorit
yoted against Blease out of a total of 135,000. This majoi
ity was voted for Manning and Cooper. The greatest mi
jority of Cooper votes were undoubtedly against Bleasi
for Mr. Cooper's platform is almost identical with Mi
Manning's. The principal plank in both Coopbr's an
Manning's platforms is that of enforcing the law. The
stand squarely together on this issue, as against the nor
snforcement of law that has already characterized the ac
ministration of Blease. x
The problem that is now confronting the anti-Bleas
faction is getting their full strength to the polls next Tue;
day. If every anti-Blease vote is voted next Tuesday
Richard I. Manning will be elected by a safe majority.
The total enrollment of Democratic voters in Sout
Carolina is more than 160,000. Of this number only aboi
135,000 voted. Therefore, about 25,000 men in this Stat
failed to vote in the first primary, for one reason or ai
Dther. A large number of this 25,000 were out of thei
noting precincts on the election day. THEY MUST B!
BROUGHT HOME.
The State now faces the greatest crisis in many yeari
rhe issue is clean-cut. It is whether the State shall b
iominated by Blease or one opposed to the policies c
Blease. There is no third candidate. It is Blease or Mai
aing.
Every voter in Bamberg county has influence with som<
body. Let every anti-Blease man look around him an
iscertain who voted in the first primary and who did no
3ee to it YOURSELF that every anti-Blease mairgoes t
the polls next Tuesday. Let no voter escape your attei
fcion.
You people who own automobiles, you will be servin
the best interests of your State by cranking up next Tue:
lay morning and staying at your voting precinct. Kee
in close touch with the polls. When you observe that a
mti-Blease voter has failed to show up, start your engin
to going and GET THAT MAN. South Carolina need
tiim.
You doubtless know of a voter who is not now at honn
Get his address and get in touch with him TODAY. Urg
upon him the necessity of coming home to vote. Writ
iiim a personal letter. Your letter may be the means c
jetting a heretofore LUKEWARM voter to go to the poll
ind do his full duty to himself and to his State.
The Herald wishes to repeat that it has no candidate
for county offices. Let the people of Bamberg county elec
ivhom they will. We urge upon the people the election c
but one man. and that man is Richard I. Manning1.
' o
It has come to the attention of The Herald that man
men voted against their best judgment in the governor'
race in the first primary in order to help some of their pei
sonal friends for other offices. The first primary is noi
settled. Your vote will help to elect or defeat one or th
jther of the two gubernatorial candidates.
Blease stands defeated. All the voters of the State hav
;o do now is to KEEP him defeated. A full vote must b

RIGHT.
If Cole Blease is elected governor, it will be due to bu
)ne fact: The failure of the anti-Blease men to vote.
Let your FIRST duty be to the State of South Carolina
Shall the victory of two years ago, brought about only b;
lard work, go by default to the man whom we know i
!JOT the choice of the majority of voters in South Caro
ina?
WE HARDLY THINK SO. The Blease men are beat
ind they know they are beat. Blease is yet to be elected
md heaven and earth will be turned over in the effort to
lefeat the wishes of the people in the primary next Tues
lay.
YOU WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO THIS TRAGEDY

MANNING WILL WIN.
Tillman Urges 25,000 Who Didn't
Vote to Cast Ballot Next Tuesday.
f Columbia, Sept. 4.?"Woodrow
^ | Wilson will be reelected president of
i the United States next November and
I Richard I. Manning will be renomi81
nated governor next Tuesday," said
jl' Senator B. R. Tillman this afternoon
j as he was leaving for his home at
I- Trenton, after spending the day in
VyUlU III U lcl.
The senator says he is enjoying
y fine health and he appears to be in
the best of spirits. He left Washington
about two weeks ago and
i since that time has been resting on
his farm at Trenton. He says that
he does not expect to return to the
r national capital until next Decem*
'ber.
d While speaking of the South Carolina
race for the governorship, he
y was extremely emphatic and the oldtime
battle fire gleamed in his eye.
He says that Blease will probably
I" get a small percentage of the Cooper
vote, the remainder going to Governor
Manning.
10 "There is not a bit of use to get
stampeded," said Senator Tillman.
5" "If the people do as I expect and
j think they will Blease will never be
elected." He felt sure the people
when once aroused would go to the
ballot box, and if they did he was
satisfied Manning would be nominatit
ed.
He claims that there are fully 25,000
enrolled voters that did not go to
. the polls last Tuesday but that if
I f Atr Trrv f Vi A nrAA/1 A f f ll A Qf of A Q t
tlicj IICL V ^ 111^ 5VJUU VI tnc Ulttiu Ut
LF heart, they will vote against Blease
n in the next primary. And he is firmly
of the opinion that they will.
"The good Lord has nothing
against South Carolina," said the
S. senator, "and he will not let a man
like Blease again be governor of
South Carolina. But the Lord helps
)f those who help themselves, and it is
up to the voters to get (jut and give
I" an emphatic victory to Governor
Manning and a like emphatic defeat
to the personal ambitions of Cole L.
3- Blease."
- While in the city today Senator
** Tillman called at the executive man?
sion to see Governor Manning, but
the governor was out and did not get
>0 to see the senator.
1- COLUMBIAN KILLED.
Meets Death When Car Falls Into
g Mill Race.
3- Columbia, Sept. 2.?Edward F.
Girardeau, a prominent cotton buyer
P of Columbia, was killed, ?Roy E. Parji
rish, checker at th? Columbia Compress
and Warehouse company, of
16 this city, was badly "hurt and P. H.
Jeffords, another Columbia cotton
buyer, was slightly injured when a
touring car turned turtle at a steel
highway bridge crossing a mill pond
race at the farm of Dr. E. C. L.
0 Adams, recent candidate for Lieutenant
governor, about eight miles
south of Columbia this evening at
8:15 o'clock. The car was driven
by Mr. Jeffords and in the front seat
is with him was Mr. Parrish, his
brother-in-law, while in the rear seat
was Mr. Girardeau. According to
Ig Mr. Jeffords, the car was running at
a lively clip. When an embankment
approach was reached near the
bridge the car skidded, crashed into
the wood railing along the fill, struck
the guards of the steel bridge, overturned
and fell fifteen feet to the
y rocky bottom of the race below. Mr.
S Jeffords, who was thrown out of the
car into the two feet of water, was
*
dazed by the rail, but was not badly
jj hurt. He found Mr. Parrish partially
under the car, pulled him out and
6 placed him on the bank. Going back,
he walked around the car, which had
fallen on its side, but could not lo6
cate Mr. Girardeau. Getting assistance
in about fifteen minutes after
p
v the accident happened, the car was
g partially turned over and the dead
body of Mr. Girardeau was found beneath,
almost completely covered by
? water. An autopsy was performed
late tonight over the body and the
physician was of the opinion that
death was caused from strangulation
^ by drowning. According to the phyy
sician the wounds sustained by Mr.
Girardeau were not sufficient to have
S caused his death.

For several years past the last Saturday
in September has by many of
our citizens been observed as OrI

J men and women, boys and girls, to

of the day to the support of some

IN THE PALMETTO STATE
SOME OCCURRENCES OF VARIOUS
KINDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
State News Boiled Down for Quick
Reading.?Paragraphs About
Men and Happenings.
William Newton, an orphan boy,
aged 16, committed suicide in Greenville
county last week in a fit of despondency.
The National Guard encamped at
Fort Bliss, Texas, voted for governor
as follows: Blease, 330; Manning,
216; Cooper, 145.
The wholesale dry goods house of
W. F. Furtick & Co., in Columbia,
was destroyed by fire Friday night,
entailing a loss of $17,000, one half
of which is covered by insurance.
Marshall Huggins, a white boy
aged 1 6, cut Roff Jacobs, a negro boy,
to death in Marlboro county last
week. Huggins said that the reason
he cut Jacobs was because the negro
had cursed him.
Attorney General Thos. H. Peeples
has been elected president of the
National Association of Attorneys
General. The tenth annual convention
of the association was held in
Chicago this week.
A warehouse belonging to J. A.
Watson, of Chesterfield county, and
containing several bales of new crop
cotton and a quantity of bagging was
destroyed by fire Tuesday. The loss
is estimated at $2,000.
Lillie Spradley, a white girl nine
years of age, was shot and instantly
killed at Cassett, Kershaw county,
last week by Lillie May Thompson, a
young negress. The negress is believed
to be of unsound mind.
The State insurance department
turned into the State treasury during
the month of August, 1916, $33,660.01,
making the to,tfal collections
for the year $174,681.45. The total
collections for 1915 were $179,988.20.
Arthur C. Stevenson, Charleston
manager of the National Cash Register
company, committed suicide in
Charleston Tuesday by shooting himself.
He was 30 years of age and
leaves a family. No cause is assigned
for the suicide. .
William Simpson, age 21, is lying
at the point of death in an Anderson
hospital as the result of an affray on
the streets of Lowndesville Tuesday
morning with George Mitchell. Simpson's
father, Ross Simpson, was
slightly wounded.
Because the management would
not grant them a ten per cent, increase
in wages, the 500 employees
of the Equinox mills of Anderson
went on a strike last week. Operatives
of the Gluck mills in Anderson
have been on a strike for the same
reason for several weeks.
The "Bull Moose" party of South
Carolina at a meeting of Progressive
leaders in Columbia last week
brought out a State ticket. John
Cantey, of Camden, is their candidate
for governor, T. W. Miller, a
traveling man of Columbia, is nominated
for lieutenant governor and
W. C. Plant, of Columbia, route agent
for the Southern railway, was nominated
for State treasurer. No other
State candidates were named.
Newspapers.
A newspaper is a family school in a
family, worth ten dollars a year.
Even the most barren paper brings
something new. Children read the
contents, gain intelligence of important
affairs of the world, and acquire
useful knowledge, of more importance
to them in life thran a present
of fifty acres of land.
Parents are not aware of the vast
importance of a newspaper in a family
of children. We have made the
remark before, and repeat it, that
take two families of children equally
smart, and both going to one school
?let one of them have free use of a
newspaper, and it would excite astonishment
to mark the difference between
them.
Fully one-half, and an important
half of education, as it respects the
business of the world, and the ability
to raise and make one's self respectable
in it, is derived from newspapers.
What parent would not wish
to see his children respectable?
Would he be willing to have his
neighbor's children more intelligent
than his own? Yet how trifling is the
sum a newspaper costs. It is even
in these hard times absolutely con
leiiipiaum in inn u u 111, anu nu tuau
ever felt it, except in its beneficial
consequences, who paid the subscription
regularly once a year.?From
the Greensboro Patriot, December,
1843.
