F.KIK. I'd.. Sept. 7. .James A.
Waddell. noted in labor circles as
"the king of strike-breakers. " is
breaking all records between Chi
cago and New York in his endeavor
to get to the latter place and take
command of the employers fc rees
in the lntcrborouh strike there.
The special Iike Shore train that
Waddell (bartered in Chicago late
last night at a cost of $:i.O00. has
averaged well over i0 miles an hour
.so far on the trip.
NFW YORK, Sept. 7. Traction
otticials asserted today that the
strike called last night on the sub
way and elevated lines of the In
terhorough llapid Tram-it Co., and
on the surface lines of the New
York Surface Railways Co.. would
speedily collapse. They based this
claim on the fact that the motor
men ami signalmen on the under
ground and "I" lines had remained
loyal to the employers.
"Practically none of the motor
men on either the subway or "W
lines left his work." it was stated
at traction headquarters. "If these
skilled men stick, this fact in itself
constitutes a victory for the com
pany." The strike leaders. headed by
Gen. Organizer William 11. Fitzger
ald, professed confidence in their
tinal victory, but there was an ab
sence of enthusiasm at the Conti
nental hotel headquarters when re
ports came in from all quarters that
the companies involved were run
ning their trains and cars almost
on schedule time.
Train U nombanlod.
Some disorder marked tlu
hours of the strike. A few
early
ticket
their
sellers were dragged from
posts and an elevated train
was
bombarded with bricks at lälst st.
and Kighth av. The missiles were
hurled from a tenement building
that parallels the tracks at that
point.
To protect the loyal motormen
wire cages so constructed as to ward
off all missiles but bullets, were
placed in each motor car. F.ehind
their barriers the motormen pro
ceeded with their work.
Reporters fir the International
News Service investigated the situ
ation on the various lines and found
these conditions prevailing:
1 On the subway all trains were
running virtually on schedule time
t'uring the early morning "rush"
hours.
J On the "L." lines conditions
were practically the same. In some
instances the crews consisted in part
of strike-breakers, but all were in
uniform.
n No attempt wis made to run
surface cars of the New York Rail
ways Co. between midnight and ?
a. m. At the latter hour, however,
cars were sent out from the barns
and On. Mgr. Hedley claimed that
practically normal service could be
furnished during the day.
4 Five thousand policemen,
practically half. ef the city's force,
were detailed to strike duty. Ar
oflicer was stationed on every plat
form of the subway and elevated
lines.
IJefore the strike was 12 hours old
the carmens" leader., declared that
a sympathetic strike would be call
ed, if necessary, among the long
shoremen who handle the fiKd for
the Interborough power house.
Such action would prove serious to
the company, but Pres't Theodore
P. Shonts aserted he was prepared
for any such emergency.
Kstimutes of the number of men
on strike differed widely. The union
leaders claimed that half of the In
terborough employes were members
of the Amalgamated asociation of
Street and Klectric Railway Em
ployes, would obey the strike order,
but the traction orricials asserted
that not more than 2.0"-i) of the
11. '.'(.hi employes had joined the
union.
Gen. Mgr. Hedley declared that
70 per cent of the men would abide
by the individual contracts which
they signed arid which the com
pany refused to abrogate, this action

WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. The
first step toward gradual withdraw
al and mustering out of all military

taken today when Sec'y of "War
Raker ordered all militiamen so far
withdrawn from the border to be
discharged from the federal service.

Retaliatory Legislation to
Combat Europe's Commer

Intermit iti 1 1 News Ser i e :
WASHINGTON, .ept. 7. I-atin-
American diplomats in Washington
today were agreed that the republics
of South America and Central
America will follow the lead of the
United Slates in enacting retaliatory
legislation to combat the commer
cial war to be waged by Kuropean
nations at the do.se of the war. The
Chilean and Argentine governments,
according to advices reaching the
envoys of those nations today, are
framing legislative programs, con
templating a horizontal raise in Im
port duties of certain products.
Other nations to the south, it wa:-
.said, will act in concert to prohibt
foreign domination.
Chile, the greatest nitrate pro
ducer in the world, will take her
place in the lead, her diplomats
said, by increasing by 2' per cent
the normal duties on articles from
such countries as are believed to be
commercially hestile, and by placing
an export duty on Chilean nitrates.
The Chilean legation today ad
mitted that the plans now under
way have been evolved from confi
dential advice from abroad to the
effect that practically all of the
European belligerents planned to
swamp South American republics
with an avalanche of European
product?, most of them in competi
tion with their own industries.
