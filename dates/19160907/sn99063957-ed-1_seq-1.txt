Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 7. A
mighty wave of democracy will sweep
the world at the end of the present war,
bringing with it the enfranchisement
of women both in the United States
ond Europe, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Oatt,
president of the National Association
for Woman Suffrage, declared at. this
afternoon's session of the national con
vention. "Another tide of political liberty,
similar to that of 1S48, but of a thou
sand fold greater momentum, is rising
from the bnttle field and hospital, from
ramp and munition factory," said Mrs.
4"att. "In Great Britain hundreds of
bitter, active opponents have confessed
their conversion on account of the war
services of women. Above the roar of
the cannon, the screams of shrapnel and
the whirr of the aeroplanes, one who
listens may hear the cracking of fetters
which have long bound the European
woman to outworn conventions.
"The woman's hour has struck. It
lias struck for the women of Europe
and for those of all the world. If our
own people possess the sense of patriot
ism nnd the sense of nationality which
nhould be the inheritance of an Amer
ican, they will not wait until the war
is ended, but will boldly lead in the
inevitable march of democracy, our own
Americnn specialty."
Subject Wag "The Crisis."
Mrs. Catt's subject was "The
Crisis." The suffrage movement, she
jiointed out, had made rapid strides from
1910 to 191B and is now approaching a
crucial period when the suffrage lead
ers must put forth their greatest ef
forts. Particularly she urged women
lo awake from the passive attitude that
"suffrage is bound to come."
"Our cause has won the indorse
ment of all political parties; every can
didate for the presidency is a suffrag
ist," she said.
"It has won the indorsement of most
churches; it has the hearty approval of
nil great organizations of women. The
majority of the press iu most states is
with us. Great men in every political
party, church and movement are with
us. The names of the greatest men and
women of art, scieace, literature, phil
osophy, reform, religion and politics are
on our lists.
"But e have not won the reaction
aries of any party, church or society
ana we never win. we have not. won
the ignorant nnd illiterate and we nev
er can. We have never won the forces
of evil anil e never will. As Speaker
Chomp Clark said the other day, 'some
good and intelligent people are opposed
to woman suffrage; but all the ignor
ant nnd evil minded nre against it.'
"The liquor forces have developed nn
organized opposition, apparently sup
ported by large funds which have been
un active factor in every campaign ex
cept two since 1890 anil in those two
we won. The secretary of one state
liquor association recently said to a
man of honor that they would not allow
another state to be carried for woman
suffrage within the next 10 years.

RIPLEY REFUSES 10
OBEY ADAMSON LAW
Says Santa Fe Will Accept
Law When It Has To
Great Northern Accepts
Topeka, Kan., Sept. 7. The Atchison
Topeka and Santa Fe railroad will not
comply with the Adumson eight hour
law until commanded to do so by the
court ot last resort. This was learned
definitely here today following a for
mal statement issued by E, P. Ripley,
president ot the Snuta Fe before re
turning to Chicago.
"The new law, hastily enacted by
congress, is nothing more or less than
an advance of 20 to 25 per cent in
wages of the best paid men in rail
road service," Ripley said. "The Santa
Fe will not comply with the law un
til ordered to do so by the court of
last resort."
Ripley said that any other class of
railway workers is entitled to more
money than the trainmen. The Santa
Fe head was in Topeka with other of
fiiials attending the funeral of Charles
. Rounz, late general manager of the
eastern lines.
Great Northern Accepts
St. Paul, Minn., Sept. 7 The Cireat
Northern will scrupulously obey tiie
provisions of the Adamson eight hour
lull, it was announced today. This an
nouncement, coining in the face of the
Santa Fe announcement that it would
obey none of the provisions of the bill,
seemed to substantiate a recent rumor
in railroad circles here. This was that
either the Great Northern or the Santa
Fe would be chosen to flagrantly vio
late the bill, to force government ac
tion that would bring a test iu courts.
The Santa Fe was chosen, it was said,
because of the strength of its legal de
partineut.
Other Boads Reticent
Chicago, Scut. 7. Western railroad
officials were reticent today as to
whether they would follow the action
of President E. P. Ripley of the Santa
Fe, who had declared his road will
ignore, the Adamson eight hour bill un
til forced to recognize it.
Many Undecided
Pan Francisco, Sept. 7. If the an
nouncement of President Riplev, of the
Santa Fe railroad that his road would
fight the Adamson eight hour bill cre
ated any excitement in Pacific coast
railroad circles, it was not apparent on
the surface today.
The Southern Pacific has come to
no decision regarding the matter, ac
cording to William R. Scott, vice pres
ident and general manager of that
road.
"None of us has received any other
text of the Adamson law than that
which appeared in the press," he said.
"We are still thinking about the mat
ter. I cannot say what our conclusion
will be, nor what action our company
will take."

Washington, Sept. 7. The allies are
discussing among themselves more dras

Here arc some of the demands likely
to be made on Germany:
1 he ceding to England of Heligoland.
Neutralization of the Kiel canal.
Demolition of some of the stroneest

The list of demands was obtained to

ment both in this country nnd abroad.
There are many officials among the nl
licd nations whose desire to see Ger
many "absolutely crushed" leads them
to propose even harsher terms than
those listed. In order to break down
the power of centralized Germany, it is
suiu tnese men are in favor of offering
lenient peace terms to adjoining states
willing to sever their political connec

The main concern of the allies is not

SAY FIVE CENT LOAF
IS CERTAIN TO GO
Bakers Insist Flour Prices
Are Such Small Loaf Must
Be Cut Out
Chicago, Sept. 7. Elimination of
five cent bread for the ten cent loaf
was considered certain today as mem
bers of the executive rommittee of tho
National Association of Master Bakers
met to take action on the proposition.
The increased cost of wheat, sugar,
lard, yeast and labor was given as the
reason for the call for the meoting.
Three ways to meet these difficulties
have been proposed reduction of the
size of the five cent loaf, increase of
the price to either six or seven cents,
or baking a ten cent loaf only. The
bakers favor the last way. They say
it takes just as much time and labor
to make a five cent loaf as to make
a ten cent loaf. The ten cent loaf, then
would practically be equal to two five
cent loaves of the present size.
linkers point out as the chief rea
son for the necessity of immediate
action the fact that flour has jumped
from $4.50 to $i.2u per barrel withm
five weeks. Before this advanco tho
average profit for the wholesale baker
ou a five cent loaf was three tenths or
a cent. Now, they say, there will be a
loss of a cent on each loaf. ;

Done By It
May Adjourn Tonight.
Washington, Sept. 7. Agreement by
the conference committee of the house
and senate on the terms of the revenue
bill was reached at 4 o'clock this after
noon and adjournment of congress some
time tonight seemed certain.
Washington, Sept. 7. Congress ex
pects to quit work late this evening or
tomorrow after a nine months session
that in many ways broke legislative
records. '
The greatest record smashing was In
appropriations. The congress Just clos
ed authorized approximately $1,711,-
,'.y:j,I.S2.14 appropriations for the next
fiscal year and 22,R75,3fl in con
tracts. ' I'nder the latter head were ap
propriations of .'i0(i,0ft0 in the further

legislative, executive and judicial bill;
2,2N7.II.")0 for rivers and harbors;
107.00 carried in the civil sundry act
and J05,fisfl,410 In the naval act.
The total in appropriations and con
tracts authorized according to esti
mates, brings the grand total up to
1.!H7,2."9,0M.(H.
The final legislative measures put
through were the eight hour bill to
avert the nation wide railroad strike
nnd the revenue law by which the gov
ernment is to raise 20.",000,000 and
which provides for the tariff commis
sion. In this measure is nlso contained the
provisions by which the president is
given power drastically to retaliate
against the British blacklist and the
British mail seizures. If, in the presi
dent's opinion, a foreign government,
engaged iu a war in which the United
States is not participating, is shown
to be discriminating against American
shippers, ships of the nation involved
ran be seized and the ship captain im
nrisoned. Use of the mails, interstate
express companies and cable, telephone

citizens of governments which discrim
