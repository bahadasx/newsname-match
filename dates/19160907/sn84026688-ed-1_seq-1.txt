C Political Jottings |
Mr. McCormick follows tin* mime
method in claiming credit for leglsla
tlon lie does in his predictions. Lie
Includes several acts of the Taft Ad
ministration.
The Democratic press is convinced
that It Is the duty of Mr. Hughes to
say something that will hurt his
chance of being elected.
President Wilson In his acceptance
speech may reply to Mr. Hughes'
charges, hut he will not answer them.
That Is an entirely different matter.
It is reported from Washington that
the Administration will Ignore most
of Mr. Hughes' charges. That Is very
much the easiest way for it to answer
them.
Governor Hughes announces In one
of his speeches that he is a construc
tionist. Hut we are willing to admit
that so fur us Democratic policies art
concerned he is it destructlonist.
Tammany leader Charles F. Murphy
announces that he will retire after
the campaign. It Is believed that many
other more or less distinguished Demo
crats will follow his example.
Grover Cleveland was the last Dem
ocratic President. He was also the
last President to issue bonds to secure
money to defray the running expenses
of the government. Hut Wilson will
tie him in this.
President Wilson will be notified of
the Democratic nomination at Shadow
Lawn. This seems a most appropriate
place for letting him know that he will
shortly have to give up Ids place in
the sun.
President Wilson will not make any
speaking dates, we are told, hut only
separate engagements for addresses,
considering a "speaking tour” undig
nified. “Too proud to fight."
What Joseplffleous Daniels, the well
known nautical militarist, can’t under
stand is why men should waste time
Plattsburglng at sen when they might
just as well learn how to become sail
ors In three lessons In any good, re
liable correspondence school.
President Wilson’s campaign man
agers are entitled to all the comfort
they cun get out of calling the roll
of Progressives who are going to vote
for him. It would be an endless tusk
to call the roll of Progressives who
are not going to vote him.
For every reason that can be ad
vanced why Progressives should vote
for Wilson, ten can be advanced why
they should vote for Hughes aud the
beauty of It Is that they know the rea
sons without having to be told.
The Wilson administration went in
to Mexico to punish Villa for his out
rage on American soil. The only
punishment Inflicted has been on
American soldiers who were shot
down at Carrlzul by order of First
Chief Carranza.
“Franklin Roosevelt, assistant sec
retary of the navy, sees strong trend
for Wilson In Maine.” —News Dis
patch. Who cun blame a man who for
three years has been assistant to Jo
sephus Daniels for “seeing things?”
Even Woodrow Wilson could not
save the Infamous Clarke amendment
to the Philippines bill. He lost the
ablest member of his cabinet, Secre
tary Garrison, because of his advoca
cy of the policy of scuttle, but even
he sacrifice of Garrison could not
save It.

Editorial Comment i|:
Bryni butts, Wilson tuts.
Watchful waiting niuketh woeful
wa ntiug.
Candidate Hughes doesn’t talk like
a tul-tutfer.
Hughes Is hammering and the Demo
crats are yammering.
The Wilson Administration stands
for taxes, and more taxes.
The Hughes trail will he cold by
the time the Democrats strike It.
As a party leader, would It be fair
to refer to J. Ham Lewis as J. "Pork"
Lewis?
Bryan says Mr. Hughes’ talks area t
judicial. No. The people cun under
stand ’em perfectly.
Can the folks on the Democratic
band wagon continue to play by the
President's notes?
Hughes says the country can't be
saved by letting it drift. That’s where
he and W. Wilson differ.
Washington reports that a new apol
ogy has been sent to First Chief Car
ranza. Looks like a habit.
Mr. Hryau Is mistaken when he says
Hughes is “vitriolic." The candidate
Is merely applying the acid lest.
A messenger of President \\ ilson
found out that Colorado women were
for the administration. No messenger,
of course, can be blamed for making
good.
Political opponents are beginning to
find that why Mr. Hughes kept silence
so long wasn't because he had lost
his longue.
Another encouraging feature about
our new navy is I hat when It Is com
pleted, Mr. Daniels will not be Secre
tary of It.
Having discovered that the Demo
crats don’t like what he Is saying Mr.
Hughes doubtless Is convinced that
he Is on the right truck.
Two futile Invasions of Mexico and
six separate and distinct policies on
the question of permitting arms and
ammunition to be sent Into that coun
try are Included In the performance of
the Wilson administration In Its deal
ings with our southern neighbors in
less than three years. It Is this char
acteristic instability of the govern
ment that makes people want a
change. „
When Charles E. Hughds said: "The
dealings of the administration with
Mexico constitute a confused chapter
of blunders,” he gave an explicit char
acterization of the Wilson administra
tion's policy In one sentence.
Just ns It Is now obstinately shut
ting Its eyes to the need of indus
trial preparedness, for three years the
Wilson administration refused to see
the need of adequate military pre
paredness. With war on our southern
border It was content to rely on a
regular army that could only muster
40,000 available men and refused to
continue the established policy of
building up our navy. When the time
came for action, the country had not
sufficient troops to police the border
and this force has been supplemented
by a trifle more than one third tha
war strength of the national guard. If
the national administration had had
the ability to interpret the signs of
the time military preparedness would
have been well under way Instead of
barely begun.

Tlmt "No class Is more instant than
labor to condemn and punish those
who without foundation lay claim to
Us gratitude" Is the assertion of John
Williams, ex-comnilsslimer of labor,
apropos of certain false claims set
forth by Vance McCormick, Democrat
ic National Chairman, In behalf of his
party.
Chairman McCormick caused to he
published In the New York Times, on
July 31, an appeal for Progressive and
Labor support, based on “twenty
measures enacted by Congress while
President Wilson has been In the
White House,” and for which he
claims credit for the Wilson adminis
tration and asks Progressive approba
tion. Commenting on this statement,
the former Commissioner of Labor
says;
"Students and promoters of sound
social legislation will do well to ex
amine this list for It contains a num
ber of Items of unusual Interest.
"We may well believe that it was
with a great deal of pride that Mr.
McCormick contemplated the record
of his party and that he drew a vivid
mental ph ture of Progressives Hock
ing t<* the support of Mr. Wilson be
cause of the things claimed on behalf
of this administration.
"It is a pity that in the Interest of
truth, which knows neither Democrat,
Progressive nor Republican, we must
mar tins remarkable statement. Nev
ertheless, it is our duty to call atten
tion to Die fact that In ins effort to
Induce support for Mr. Wilson the
Chairman of the Democratic National
Committee has fallen Into a glaring
error. We have no desire to disparage
tlie achievements of the Wilson ad
ministration, but we must enter em
phatic protest against any attempt
to pad the Record.
“Mr, McCormick claims ‘twenty
measures enacted by Congress while
President Wilson lias been In the
While House.’ This claim we dispute.
More than one-half are measures en
acted under a Republican administra
tion and were approved by ex-l’resl
dent Taft, and for others the Demo
cratic administration deserves no
credit.
“Lest anyone think that ibis Is a
groundless assertion we herewith tar
nish the record which can easily he
verilied:
From among the twenty pieces of
legislation cited by Chairman McCor
mick, I select the following!
(1) Light hoar law on government
work. 11l effect March 1. 1013. Signed
by Mr. Taft.
(2) Eight liour provision for post
office clerks. In effect generally Au
gust 24, 1012.
(3) Eight hour provision applicable
to the manufacture of ordnance for the
government. In effect January 1, 1013.
Signed by Mr. Taft.
(4) Children’s Bureau, in effect
April 0, 1012. Signed bv Mr. Taft.
(5) Industrial Commission Law to
Investigate industrial relations. In
effect August 23, 1012. Signed by Mr.
Taft.
(d) The phosphorous match law.
Enacted In 1012, effective as to tin* Im
portation of white phosphorous match
es January 1, 1013, and as to the man
ufacture of such matches July 1
1913. Signed by Mr. Tuft.
(7) The Department of Labor Law
creating a department with a secre
tary who shall he a member of the
President’s Cabinet. In effect March
4, 1013. Signed by Mr. Taft.
(8) The Parcel Post Law. in ef
fect January 1, 1013. Signed by Mr
Taft.
(0) The Federal Reserve Law
which, while passed during this ad
ministration, is based entirely on the
vast work of investigation and com
pilation done by the Monetary Com- ]
mission, during the Tuft Admlnlstra-
Ron, and closely follows, except In
certain details, the legislation recom
mended by that commission.
(10) ’The eight-hour law for the
District of Columbia, was fathered
and put through by a Republican, Sen
ator La Follette.
The anti-trnst law antedates the
Cleveland Administration although
President Cleveland never enforced it.
From (line to time, as with all great
legislative acts, It has been necessary
to amend or add to It, and (he anti
trust law of the Wilson Administra
tion was merely such an amendment,
u logical development of the original
act.
(11) The Commerce Court was ac
tunll) abolished during ftw Tuft Ad
ministration, although It has nut been
demonstrated that Its abolition was a
wise step.
“Any statement hereafter emanating
from Mr. McCormick will be subjected
to (lie closest scrutiny. The errors
in ills first effort are Inexcusable and
can only arouse resentment among
labor men and social workers. No
class is more Instant than labor to
condemn and punish those who with
out foundation lay claim to Its grati
tude.
"Will Mr. McCormick explain his
padding of the Record?"
(Siguqd) JOHN WILLIAMS,
Ex-Commissioner of Labor, New York
State.
THE INCONSIDERATE BEHAVIOR
OF A CANDIDATE.
Why does Mr. Hughes Insist upon
talking about that old-fashioned, not
to say “Iniquitous," doctrine, tlie pro
tective tariff? For nearly the whole
period of Its industrial existence, the
United Stales struggled along under
protection. The Democratic party In
IP 13 came to the relief of an afflicted
and burdened people.
The Republican Administration (not
on account of Hie tariff, It Is true)
was overthrown. Before taking over
the reins of government, and for many
years prior to that time, countless
I leinocriitlc statesmen had vainly tried
to persuade the American people that
tin protective tariff was an Iniquity,
a veritable contrivance of devils. It
fostered the trusts, and It was an ele
vator of prices even to the thirty-sev
enth story and the tower. They prom
ised relief. The poor should lie no
longer oppressed; the cost of living
should be reduced —must be, as the
sure result of a tariff for revenue—
protective only In spots, such as the
I oiiislaim sugar mills and the Carolina
cotton factories.
Doesn't Mr. Hughes know what the
Administration did which he is now
attacking? lie ought to know. The
Democrats, under the leadership of
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Underwood, re
pealed that iniquity and ulioinlimtioa,
tin I'nync-Aldrlcli tariff law —that fos
ter mother of trusts and high prices—
and enacted In Its place the present
law. Mr. Hughes knows, of course,
as every head of a family in America
knows, that I lie trusts have not yet
been dissolved and that the cost of
living is higher than ever. —that the
price of everything has reached an nu
beard-of height—but what of it?
Wlint of it, indeed? While It is
true that a protective tariff never faff
ed, under any circumstances, to pro
tect American Industry and American
labor, it Is to he considered that the
war la Europe has upset the plans of
the present low tariff administration
considerably. Also it forms an excel
lent foundation for an alibi. It Is a
very unusual condition.
Vow, the obvious tiling for Mr.
Hughes to do is to give the Demo
crats a chance to get their tariff on
straight. Never mind the patient; let
the doctor experiment. That time
won't conic, of course, until the war
Is over according to the Democratic
version. In other words the tariff
for-revenue doctrine doesn’t lit the
conditions; the conditions must he
made to lit the tariff. So why tills
dir I urbance, Mr. Hughes?
Resides, when you discuss a little
thing like the tariff, do you not know
that Son in Law McAdoo and the other
statesmen of the Democratic family
arc likely to repeat their accusation
that you arc "pettifogging"?—Charles
ton, W. Vn., Mail.
UNITED STATES’ HONOR.
Hughes’ Criticism of Foreign Policy
Approved In West.
(Portland, <>re., Telegram.)
The Republican party has selected
a standard-bearer whose utterances
from day to day Justify the people
who chose him. Not only does he
bring before the country the short
comings of the Administration that
owes Its existence to a divided Re
publlennlsm. hut his criticism Is every
where constructive.
He tells what must be done and
will be done by the party he repre
sents to prevent wastefulness and
extravagance in the governmental
expenditures and to put a stop to the
vacillating policy that has caused
other nations to believe that the
United States has no intention of
bucking up its demands made In the
Interests of Justice and humanity.
Most vulnerable of all points In the
Democratic armor is Its foreign pol
icy. Primarily this Is because of the
spoils system by which men trained
in the consular and diplomatic serv
ice through long years, have been
displaced to make room for poli
ticians and friends of politicians,
whose sole claim to preferment was
their service to the Democratic party.
"If I am elected president of the
United States,” said Mr. Hughes last
night, “I propose that every man I
put in charge of an Important depart
ment shall he a man eminently fit to dis
charge the duties of that department.”
The denuding of the diplomatic serv
ice of men of experience In order
to supply political Jobs, ns has been
done by Mr. Wilson, or with his con
sent, Mr. Hughes denounces ns “a
capital offense—trading In the good
■inme of the United States and dam
aging its honor.” “Nobody,” he adds,
"has a right to pay political debts
with the good name and honor of the
United States."
Which is clear proof that Mr.
Hughes has not been unmindful of
the high principles of government
which must be maintained in order
that this republic shall maintain Its
place us a shining example to all na
tions.
FAMILIES SPLIT
ON CAMPAIGN
Wives of Wilson Supporters
Will Take Stump For
Gov. Hughes.
DIVERTING CAMPAIGN PHASE
Washington.—Families are being di
vided by the present political Issues.
Here are a few examples. J. A. 11.
llopkius of New Jersey Is treasurer
of the Progressive (genuine) national
eonuuittee, and lias announced that
he personally favors the re-election of
Wilson. Mrs. Hopkins is a member
of the Woman's party and will lake
the stump and do all she can to
prevent the election of Wilson.
Gifford Plnchot Is for Hughes and
all the militarism Hughes and Ids
hacking cun secure. Amos Plnchot,
his brother, Is a member of the
American Union Against Militarism
and will support Wilson us lHe lesser
of two evils. Rep. William Kent of
California Is a wild-eyed enthusiast
for Wilson and is heading a Wilson
non-partisan league, while Mrs. Kent
is a member of the Woman's party
and will stump for the defeat of Wil
son.
George Middleton lias allied himself
with the group of writers who have
announced themselves for Wilson,
while ids wife, Kola La Follette, is one
of the members of the Congressional
union who will hold Wilson respon
sible for the defeat of the Susan B.
Anthony amendment. Meredith Nich
olson Is a Wilson supporter, but Mrs.
Nicholson will write and stump
against Wilson on account of his at
titude toward the federal suffrage
amendment. Mrs. Louis F. Post Is a
member of the Woman’s I’euee party
and an ardent Tolstoyan pacifist.
Louis F. Post, assistant secretary of
labor, Is for the Administration's
“reasonable" program of prepared
ness.
POPULAR HUGHES CAMPAIGN
FUND.
The plan adopted by Cornelius N.
Bliss, Jr., treasurer cf the Republican
National Committee, to raise money
for (lie campaign and Increase the
force of active workers for the elec
tion of Charles Evans Hughes to the
presidency lias peculiar merit. Mr.
Bliss asks every one who favors the
election of Mr. Hughes and wishes him
to have the support of a Republican
Senate and House to contribute $lO
and become a sustaining member of
tile Republican party. All such will
receive a certificate of membership.
That the money will prove a good in
vestment Is patent. It will help to se
cure for the country a more efficient
administration of our national affairs,
which is necessary It the prosperity
and Influence of the nation Is to con
tinue.
“There are at least 8,000,000 Repub
licans, bnt how many of them have
any evidence they are, heyond the con
sciousness that they have voted or
will vote the Republican ticket? The
work Is done by a few and the money
ordinarily is provided by fewer. Mr.
Hllss' plan offers a cure for that con
dition. Help the cause and get a cer
tificate of membership that will estab
lish your party affiliation. It Is not
expected that all the 8,000,000 Repub
licans will give $lO each, but If a
goodly number who can afford It do
so there will be a great many more
able to give much more than $lO next
time because Republican success will
mean to the country in fullest •meiiKire
preparedness, protection and
nent prosperity.
Mr. Hughes Is seeing how big the
West Is, and the West Is seeing how
big Mr. Hughes Is. It Is a happy ar
rangement.
Friends of Wilson are still trying
to explain what he meant by "too
proud to fight.” But can they tell us
what he meant by "strict accountabil
ity?”
"Eminent Judges,” says Colonel Hen
ry Wattersou, "have ever proved dis
appointing candidates." He is right.
Alton B. Darker was a big disappoint
ment to the Democrats. And so Is
Charles Evans Hughes.—Toledo Blade.
President Wilson appears to have
been keenly alive to the expediency
of accepting several invitations to
make speeches In the West. Nobody
knows any better than he that It will
take considerable shoveling to fill np
the holes that have been dug In that
locality by Justice Hughes.
It was John P. St. John of Kan ts,
one time Prohibitionist candidate for
president of the United Stales, who
said that Americans vote ns they
cheer. If so, there Is mighty linle
consolation for the Democratic parly
In this campaign, for the Democratic
Administration In three years has giv
en us nothing to cheer over. On the
contrary, as Mr. Hughes has said,
these last three years have been years
of humiliation and embarrassment.
Mr. Wilson says his mind Is pro
gressive, but those who try to follow
Its progress can never tell the direc
tion It Is taking. It Is Just as likely
to be progressing backward us for
ward.
At Princeton Mr. Wilson used to
confer honors upon D. Ds. He couldn’t
break the habit when It came to De
serving Democrats.

During the Present Administration
We Have Seized a Mexican Port and

Sometimes you hear men, sensible
men. too, say, “I’m point; to vote for
Wilson tins .tear because he kept us
out of war.”
Ask such men a short question.
Ask them, "Out of what war?”
I >iil Mr. Wilson keep us out of the
F.uropeau War? No. lie lias himself
In a formal address to congress spok
en of the Kuropean war as “a war
with which we have nothing to do, a
war whose causes do not touch us.”
How could Mr. Wilson keep us out
of a war with which we have nothing
to do and whose causes do not touch
us?
Did he keep the rest of the western
hemisphere out of the Kuropean war?
No independent nation on this side
of the world Is Involved In It; the
only people In It are the colonies of
Kuropean powers and they had no
voice in their fate, for they were au
tomatically at war when their mother
governments went to war. Who kept
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, out of
the Kuropean war? Did Mr. Wilson?
Did Mr. Wilson keep us out of war
with Mexico? No, In his term more
Americans have been killed by Mexi
cans and more American property has
been destroyed by Mexicans than by
Spaniards during the whole Spanish
war. In his term we have seized a
Mexican port and have sent our entire
regular army and militia to fight Mexi
cans. In his term Mexican armed
forces have Invaded American soli and
fought battles against our people with
in our boundaries.
President Taft went through two
Mexican revolutions during his term,
the revolution against Diaz and the
revolution against Madero. American
lives were safe In Mexico during that
time. No Mexican cities were seized
by Americans and no armed Mexicans
Invaded the United States while Mr.
Taft was In the White House. Yet Mr.
Tuft never thought of asking the
American people to vote for him be
cause he kept us out of war with
Mexico. lie put an embargo on arms
so that American weapons would not
he sent across the boundary, and he
refused to Interfere In Mexican affairs.
When he left office Mexicans liked
Americans and Americans were safe
In Mexico. Since he loft office Mexi
cans hate Americans and Americans
dare not remain In Mexico. Did Mr.
Wilson keep ns out of war with Mexi
co? Not If words mean anything.
Mr. Wilson did not keep us out of
the Kuropean war and he did not keep
us out of war with Mexico.
Out of what war, then? Detroit

him to tell those who look to him

corns that Ue was the greatest friend
of labor laws that ever occupied the
Governor’s chair at Albany. During
his two terms he has signed fifty-six
labor laws, Including among tliem the
host labor laws ever enacted In this
or any state.
“lie also urged the enactment of
labor laws In his messages to the
Legislature, even going so fur ns to
place the demand for a labor law In
one of his messages to an extra ses
sion of the Legislature.
"Only U>‘2 labor laws have been
enacted in this state since Its erec
tion in 1777—1 n 133 years. One-third
of these, exceeding In quality all of
the others, have been enacted and
signed during Gov. Hughes’ term of
three years and nine months.”
Let organized labor take to heart
what the Chicago Tribune says on
this point: "Mr. Hughes is no dem
agogue and no visionary. lie Is a
man of courage and conscience, and
If labor cannot confide Its cause to
his rock bottom Americanism there Is
some thing wrong with Us cause.”—
Boston Herald.
