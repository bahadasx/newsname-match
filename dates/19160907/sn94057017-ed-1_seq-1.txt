A number of Republicans in Santa Fe county
are oil' the reservation with their war paint on,
and are going to join with the Democrats in
nominating a county ticket. We notice that
E. P, Oaviea and Frank Davit are participating
in the movement. Mr. Davies was elected to
the legislature in this district on the Republi
can ticket two jears ago, and ran far ahead of
the ticket. Republican politics in the ancient
city must be pretty rank when as strong a
partisan as Mr. Davies finds bis stomach
turned.

AT
E
The meeting held last Satur
day afternoon for the purpose of
arranging for the fair this fall
was well attended, and the in
terest was such as to assure a
good fair. The best of it was
that the farmers and stock men
were present in force and taking
an active part in the proceedings-After
a pretty thorough dis
cussion measures were taken to
form a permanent organization.
J. M. Milbourn was elected
temporary president, Ira Allman
temporary secretary, and Fred
H. Ayers assistant temporary
secretary.
Committees were appointed as
follows:
Constitution and By-Laws S.
M. King, C. L. Riley, W. D.
Wasson.
Rules, Regulations, Etc. S.
B. Oren, George Merrifield, J. A.

Women's Exhibits Mrs. J. L.

and Mrs. Willie Elgin, Mr. and
Mrs. Ed Roberson. ,
Publicity J. L. Stubblefield,
J.-A. Constant, Dr. C. E. Ewing,
Mrs. C. E. Ewing.
It was decided by motion that
any number of committee mem
bers assembled pursuant to a call
should constitute a quorum to
proceed with the duties oi such
committee; also that the first
named on each committee shall
act as chairman, and in the ab
sence of the chairman the next
in order named shall so act.
A motion prevailed that the
temporary officers shall act until
permanent officers are elected.
The meeting adjourned to Sat
urday, September 9th, 1 o'clock
f . M.
Our understanding is that ar
rangements for this year's fair
are to proceed coincidently with
the forming of the permanent
organization, and that the com-
mittees are to go ahead with the
preparations with all possible
speed.
In answer to a question on the
subject, Mr. Fred H. Ayers in
forms us that our laws make
special provision for the incorpo
ration of such associations; that
the cost will not exceed $10, and
that such a corporation is not re
quired to issue stock or make re
ports. Hence, if it is deemed
desirable to incorporate, it is a
very simple matter and easily
accomplished.
Now. let us all take hold and
hustle for a good fair. It will
require some tall hustling if we
have our fair before the state
fair.

much by itself, but in connection
with other figures it may mean a
great deal. In the assessment
abstract published in this paper
two weeks ago a cipher was
missing which made a big differ

lots on the rolls for 1916, where
as it should have read 8750.
