MISS ABBOTT PUTS
IN GREAT DAY AS A
CIRCUS PERFORMER
BY MABEL ABBOTT
Yes, I ni.lr .in elephanl in the circus
d*W^ m^-r And as my Inter, gaily caparisoned
j| H steed bore me in my spangled robe slowly
and grandly along Hi street, bands .mil
■ I MM gilded wagons and cavalcades of dashing
mMI AMaM riders in front of tin- and ;i calliope behind
the fnu of the thing was mixed up with a queer little regret -a
regret that the little girl I used to be, could not be standing in
the crowd down there on the curbstone to see one of her dreams
come true.
The tents were just rising on the sandy, grassy "lot" back
Of the Northerp Pacific freight sheds when 1 went out to apply
for a temporary job as circus performer.
My heart sank as I looked at the turmoil of creaking wag
ons, strings of straining horses and gangs of men hauling at
ropes or unloading cages.
Where, in these acres of wild confusion, could I possibly
find anyone to listen to me?
But my first bewildered iniiuiry found a system in the con
fusion that extended down to the drivers of tent-pegs, and
steered me straight to the right person.
—And 1 had a magic letter which made impossible things
easy.
So 1 joined the circus and was told to go to the dressing
tent.
There "Granny" Talhot took charge of me- Granny Talbot
who has heen with the show so long that nobody can renienilier
when she wasn't a part of it.
She is 72 years old. Once she was a dancer, and the great
tent applauded when she leaped into the ring.
Now she is head of the women's dressing tent, "Granny" to
every girl there, helping young, strong bodies to trick them
selves out for their triumphs.
"So you're to ride the elephant:" observed Granny wel
comingly. "Well, well, come in and we'll get you dressed'"
It was a strange vista that I stepped _^
Into, golden in the light thai filtered through _A
the blown tent-walls, alive with the ___.
of splendid young bodies, and cheerful with ~S Jj
chatter many languages.
The floor was the dry grass and sand of f\ W
the "lot"; and down Hie whole length of the II J\
tent ran rows of trunks. ** -"
At each trunk was a girl. Some were sitting on their camp
stools, quietly sewing or reading letters.
Some were slipping out of their clothing as serenely un
conscious as if alone, and donning the gorgeous costumes of the
parade.
Some, the aristocrats of the ring, who would not be re
quired to ride in the parade, were heating water or flatirons
on little alcohol stoves and doing the many little things that
girls everywhere find to do.
Most of those who were getting ready for the parade were
the girls of the "statue act," "Granny Talbot explained to nte,
as she bustled around, though there were some "iron jaws,"
aerial acrobats and others.
They were Spanish, German, French, Austrian, Russian.
Chinese, Dutch, Mexican, American and Italian, but they were
all magnificent young creatures, slender-ankled and deep-chest
ed, and lithe as cats as they bent to lace a shoe or squirmed into
a spangled bodice.
"Here's your costume," said Mrs. Catherine Wallace, ward
robe mistress, as she dumped a mass of velvet, beads and span
gles beside me. And I, too, began to dress.
They are good friends, those circus girls. One lent me
powder and her own puff; another furnished a broken scrap of
mirror; and it was Mrs. DeKoe, star of one of the biggest acts
In the circus, who brought me some rouge, and then, seeing
how awkward 1 was, took the pad from my hand and put. it on
for me.
f. But it was Granny Talbot herself who came and looked me
over when I had got into the loose robe of purple velvet and
/ the plumed cap.
—Frankly, the trappings of the circus queens looked a
little different on close inspection, from my dazzled memory of
them as seen from the curbstone. The diamonds were not dia
monds, but glass beads; the spangles were tin, I think; and the
silver In the cap was tinsel.
The gown was too shoit for me and
came onlj a little below mj knees.
_M B "Hut your feet won't show," Granny
Jf^Tm m* practically.
ttjT^^C^. know. ray dear," she added, a different
. ■r-Ti —» —» tone, "the first thing I ever did with this
show was to ride the elephant? That was years ago—years
and years ago."
Granny Talbot's hand smoothed the spangled velvet over
my shoulder. And all the illusion that had for a moment al
most faded for me, came back at the look In her eyes.
"Are you the reporter lady?" asked a girl in a gown like
my own.
"I ride the other elephant, and I'll take you over to the
menagerie tent."
AND 1 STEPPED OUT OK THE DRESSING-TENT INTO
THE DREAM OK MY CHILDHOOD.
The elephants were waiting. I was to ride Albert; my
fiuide, little Mrs. Edwards, was to ride Liz; and the others were
to follow two by two, without riders.
Albert was just the color of the "big top," and looked
about the same size as 1 stood below the red velvet trappings
that covered his huge sides.
1 got up by means of a ladder, and seated myself In the
little box on top of him, on a level with the heads of the
giraffes.
"Watch yourself, lady, while I get up." warned a man in a
red Jacket, and even as he spoke, Albert lurched forward on one
knee, lifted his driver to his great, gray head, rose again as
suddenly, and my box began a series of oscillationu, gvtations
and heaves which reminded me of a very small chip dancing on
a very large wave; and out we went, to take our place in the
. parade.
AND OH BUT IT WAS QUEER AND
THRILLING AND WONDERFUL! _■___■___.
I looked ahead, and as far as I could see, fl BS.
the glittering line moved like a gorgeous "J^^^J^X -
snake. I looked behind, and saw my little ~ •» •** 7s*^
friend lurching on '___*' Just as I was lurching on "Albert";
and behind her came a double row of heaving, gray backs.
And on both sices of us. and far below, were the crowds on
► the sidewalks, their faces turned upward to see us.
Our eyes were level with the second-story windows of the
■ buildings, and they too were crowded with faces. There were
i faces, faces everyhere—faces of children that laughed or gasped,
faces of men and women with the spirit of childhood alight
again in their eyes; faces that reflected the glitter and glamor
of the spectacle. (.Continued on Page Eight.)

ACCUSE
VAUGHN
FARMER
Charged with Inn ing kid
naped Minnie Lee, 15-year
old daughter of a neigh
bor's family, llert Itralimer,
nge ;l_, rancher, of Vaughn,
in the Hay Island district,
is being sought by police of
the Northwest today.
A warrant was sworn out by-
Mrs. Ida Lee, mother of the mis
sing girl, In Deputy Prosecutor
Seldon's office Thursday morn
ing. Brahmer is believed to luu'e,
taken the girl to British Colum- '
bia.
According to Mrs. Lee, her
daughter was employed for more
than a year as maid in the
Brahmer home. Brahmer began
paying attentions to the girl with
the result that .Mrs. Brahmer re
cently filed suit for divorce.
Other Charges Possible
The decree was granted last
week, Mrs. Brahmer being given
custody of her four children. The
ranch was sold, and father and
mother divided the money.
A day later the newly-divorced
husband disappeared, taking
with him Minnie Lee, according
to the mother. The girl did not
tell her mother that she planned
to disappear with Brahmer and ,
aparently had made no plans for I
departure. j
"Because of the girl's age, it ,
is a case of kidnaping, whether
or not she went of hor own con- ,
sent," explained Deputy Prose
cutor Seldon Thursday. i
"There are other charges
which may follow. If Brahmer
marries the girl we will charge
him with contempt of court, for ,
violating the six months' divorce i
limit.
"If he takes her to another t
state or to British Columbia he j
will be prosecuted under the
white slave act. We have already j
asked the police and sheriffs of
the entire Northwest to arrest!
him. j
Mrs. Lee notified Selden that
she believed her daughter was
soon to become a mother.
The mother of the missing girl j
has eight children, of whom Mm- |
nic is the eldest. The girl's ,
father left home two years ago \
and Mrs. Lee haß been suportlng
the family unussisted since that i
time.
JEALOUSY NAMED

BAKER, Ore., Sept. 7.—Mrs.
Mary Davis, who was killed last
night by Harvey Shoemaker, who

cording to George Howard, who

Howard told the police that he
was calling on Mrs. Davis last
night when Shoemaker entered
the room and began shooting.

"We placed a penalty clause In

RECORD SHOWS
SEATTLEITE TO
BE PLAIN LIAR!
Congressman Humphrey and his unscrupulous
mouthpieces, the standpat papers, have again been
caught deliberately lying. The Congressional Rec
ord nails their slander. They lied about U. S. Sena
tor Poindexter's vote on a tariff on lumber and shin
gles.
Humphrey, with malicious intent —for he must
have known he was lying—declared that Senator
Poindexter voted against a tariff on lumber and
shingles. 11 is standpat papers took up the cry.
And Humphrey knew very well—for the Congres
sional Record is accessible to him—that not only did
Senator Poindexter vote FOR a tariff on lumber
and shingles, hut that he himself ( Poindexter) offer
ed an amendment to the [Jnderwood law to that ef
fect, and that Senator ,Jones of Washington made a
speech on Sept. (>, 1913, supporting Senator Poinde\
ter's amendment.
The question of i tariff on shingle, and lumber
came up to a vote three times during the discussion
of the underwood law. Twice it came up on Sept.
2 —on amendments offered by Sen. Jones. POIN
DEXTER VOTED WITH JONES OX BOTH OR
THOSE AMENDMENTS. On the first amendment,
Sen. Jones secured 21 votes against 44, and on tlie
second lie got 22 voles against 42.
The second amendment provided a tariff of 25
cents a thousand on shingles.
On Sept. 6, 1913, tottT days later, Sen. Poindexter
introduced his amendment, providing for a tariff of
$1.25 a thousand feet tin lumber and 25 cents a thous
and on shingles. This amendment was especially]
aimed against British Columbia.
| Sen. Poindexter made a speech in behalf of the
amendment —and so did Sen. .Jones. Sen. Jones'
speech in behalf of I'oindexter's tariff on lumber and
shingles is found on page 4:>:»(> of the Congressional
Record for Sept. 6,1913.
I The vote on this amendment is found on page 43:17
J —and Sen. Jones and Poindexter voted alike — FOR
I Poindexter'i amendment FOR a tariff on lumber
| and shingles. «
Yet, in the face of these official facts, Humphrey,
! malicious and reckless in his desperation, continues
to mouth his slander and untruthful papers echo his
statements.
