.'The ity cmncil ,lield a' busy meeting
matters disposed of were the election -of
Anderson and Christie, eivil engineerspf
Cuarlotte'to have charge 'of ; the perma
netn improvement work authorized by
the recent bond election; granting much
needed relief to -the v residents along
West Greene street,: who have for so
long suffered because of bad streets;
and making other preparations for the
beginning at once of the 'general pro
gram for bettering High Point streets.
The first ' matter of business was
the hearing 6f a petition o,f West
Greene . , street citizens asking that
something be done to give them a better
outlet. It was declared that because of
the antagonism to the bond issue Jt was
impossible to get a majority of the
pi opei ty owners on that street to sign
a petition asking - for permanent im
provement,, therefore ' the : petit roners
prayed that the city council ive them
such relief as it could under the-circumstances.
. They asked that certain graues
bolbwered at 'Bradner's store and wfcst
of that place; that sand clay or maca
dam paving' be laid from the C. "and. Y.
R station to the end of the street ; and
that certain curbing and sidewalk be
ordered placed
After some little discussion of con
ditions in that section of the city,
the council voted to begin work imme-diaely-on
5 the portion of the street be
yond Bradner's storey and promised to
decide within 30 days whether macadam
or sandclay would be put down on the
street east of, Bradner's - to , the C. and
Yi. R. station! The t reason given' ; f or
this delay was hi order - to see whether
the macadam to be taken up on Main
street, for the, new pavement could be
utilized in making improvements on
West Greene'.' .: The eouncil also went on
record in favor of putting down certain
curbing and sidewalk in , that; isection.' V.-
Superintendent Marr of the ; , city
schools" 'announced the Tesignations . of
Miss Wall. (teacher at Elm . streetBchool,
and ' Miss Council; at Hhet Park street
schdol. ' He. then recommended Mrs. R.
P. Chappelle as Miss Wall's successor,
and Miss Clarice ' Newlin to take the
place of Miss Council. Thfe councilmen
elected those teachers in accordance with
Prof. Marr's recommendations.
' Professor Marr then asked for an ap
propriation of a sum not to exceed $600
to buy equipment for the manual train
ing department irr the high school; he
also askeu authority to-employ a teacher
fr tbv Henartrnent The 1 , councilmen
were inclined to discuss whethre the de
partment., could be equipped and i made
ready, for work before Christmas,' but it
finally"- voted: the ' appropriation f. and
