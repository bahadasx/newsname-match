FLORIDA'S FINE
HEALTH RECORD
STATE AND LOCAL BOARDS
HAVE BEEN VIGILANT
The Good Conditions Existing are
Especially Desirable Whtn the
Schools All Over the State
are Beginning to Open
Never before in the history of
the state has the health of Flori
da's citizens been guarded with
greater watchfulness than during
the summer now drawing to a
close. The only possible excep
tions being when epidemic has ac
atually invaded and overwhelmed
individual communit i e s and
threatened the wellbeing oif all
sections.
Never before have the health
boards, state and local, been more
abrt and never before have they
had so fully the. active and intel
ligent cooperation ' of physicians
everywhere. It is a striking trib
ute of confidence in the medical
profossi'i and in the constituted
health authorities that there has
been no alarm nor undue excite
ment, in spite of the fact that the
infection of infantile paralysis
from northern centers has been a
menace to Florida in no degree
imaginary nor unreal.
j- So far as positively known at
the present writing not a single
case of the disease has entered the
state during the summer. The
statement is made with caution
while confirmation of the diagno
sis of a single doubtful case is be
ing awaited by the State Board of
Health.
In the larger centers of popu
lation in the state the general
health of citizens appears to be
quite up to the average for the
season, and probably somewhat
above the average in many cam-
p muniues. i nis is no uncertain
V. i testimony to good conditions, to
good common sense among the
people of Florida, and an evidence
of efficient sanitation under the di
rection of able health authorities,
In Jacksonville not a single case
of typphoid fever is known which
had its origin within the city, and
only a few occurrences of the dis
ease, all of which originated else
where and were brought to the
city.
Such conditions are particular
ly desirable at this season of the
war which marks the near ap
proach of the opening of the
schools of the state, urban and
rural. Some anxiety has been ex
pressed in a few communities as
1o the entire safely of opening the
schools, particularly as many
children return from vacations in
northern states just before the. be
ginning of the school year.
The State Board of Health, be
ing in cb'se touch with conditions
in every part of the state as well
as in constant communication
with the health authorities in
northern infected centers and
with the United States Public
Health Service, knows of no rea
son for postponing the openjng of
the schools beyond the usual date,
in any city or community of Flor
ida. While it is probable that the
danger of infection of infantile
paralysis being spread from New
York or other infected points may
be slightly less than it was a
month or six weeks ago, it is still
an actual possibility . But the
splendid service rendered by the
various city health boards in coop
eration with the State Board, is
still in effect, with its rigor in no
degree diminished. And this will
work as efficiently for the welfare
of the children in term as in vaca
tion. The annual opening of the
schools usually brings some slight
increase of a few of the childrens'
diseases, notably diphtheria, but
this condition the doctors expect,
and prepare accordingly. It is
not likely that the present season
will sec any marked difference in
this respect, but although this is
anticipated, it rarely has been
urged as a reason for not open
ing the schools at the customary
lime.
Florida has the reputation of
being a state of abounding health
fulness. , The reputation has been
maintained, even enhanced, dur
ing the most trying period of
1916. The conditions of climate
and temperature have, as usual,
made living here so wholly com
fortable and pleasurable, that va
cationists to northern resorts may
have in the future to invent some
new excuses for leaving their
Florida homes in the good old
summer time. State Board of
Health.
Scarcely had Mr. Hughes ac
cepted the nomination before he
began to travel "towards the sun
set." It's fortunate for the rest of the
world that Mexico hasn't any col
onies. .

September 18
Opens
The University of Florida Col
lege of Agriculture will open for

Students who intend to enter the
University for the first time this
year should make application im
mediately. The enrollment will
be larger this year than ever be-1
fore and if students make prepara
tions before the college opens
their entrance will be greatly fa
cilitated.
High school graduates and per
sons who are qualified to enter any
of the short courses and wish to
study agriculture . will find the
Florida college best for their in
struction. The college makes a
specfal study of Florida conditions
and is prepared to give the train
ing necessary for Florida farmers.
Information concerning en
trance requirements will be found
in the University Record which
will be mailed on request to the
Registrar, Gainesville, Fla.
Counties Cannot be Sued .
The Supreme Court of Florida
has handed down a written opin
ion in the case of Jas. W. Keggin
versus the County of Hillsborough
to the effect that a county cannot
be sued in the state of Florida.
The court holds that the coun-
tiesire not incorporated, but are
simply political and governmental
divisions or units and therefore
cannot be sued. , ;
Many people in Florida are of
the opinion that a county can be
sued. The opinion was written by
Chief Justice Taylor and concur
red in by Justices Shr.ckelford,
Cockrell and Whitfield. Talla

Serious Situation
If there was ever a time when
the business men of the country
should show their loyalty to the
newspapors, that time is ft hand.
The scarcity of paper and its c
normously advanced price, togeth
er with the high cost of material
used in the printing business, has
placed many publishers in a pre
carious situation. Many have
been obliged to raise their sub
scription price and increase ad
vertising rates or reduce the size
of their papers. The only salva
tion for many of those who have
done neither is a liberal patron
age from the merchants and the
prompt payment of bills and sub
scription accounts.Unless this sup
port is given until prices are re-adjusted,
there will in all likelihood
be numerous newspaper failures
and suspensions throughout the
country, which will result as dis
astrously to the communities in
which they occr as to the' pub
lishers themselves. Manatee Rec
ord. Should Be Abolished
A writer in the Madison Enter-prise-Recoredr
says: "The State
rural school inspectors are doing
an active and beneficial wrrk."
This will, no doubt, be news to
the tax payers who have to pay
the bill for their activity, and who
have never yet received any ben
efit from the expenditures.
The legislature should abolish
this office with several others.
Every department of the state
is top-heavy with inspectors draw

How About a Home Strawberry
Patch
No farmer lives as well as he
should unless he raises all the
fruit possible. Thai is why C. K.
McQuarrie, state agent for the U-
nivcrsity of 1 londa Extension I)i
vision urges every farmer to have
a strawberry patch for home use.
About the first of the year news
papers will report the sale ot the
first ripe berries. The buyer will
pay a handsome prices for them,
but the farmer can have some of
the some kind for Ua. trouble of
: 2.1
raising inciii. -
Plants set during Septcnuier or
October will produce fruit early
in January. If two or. three. var
ieties are planted and if the run
ners are kept pruieu arter the
pickings, berries m&f a had un
til the first of June, hink of it,
strawberries during five months

Mr. McQuarrie thinks that the
Lady Thompson is probably the
best variety for home use. The
Klondike and Missionary, are also
good.
Ammoniacal Solution Substitute
For Bordeaux
Growers who find bordeaux
mixture too expensive may substi
tute ammoniacal solution of cop
perajdionatcBordeaux is usually
recommended as a fungicide ex
'cem in special cases. But since
thlkjjrice of copper sulphate has
gom!up, bordeaux is expensive
and cannotlways be had. Am
moniacal solution of copper car
bonate is not only cheaper but it
is easier to make. It may be sub
stituted in almost every case
where bordeaux is recommended,
ft is just as efficient exoept that
it does not stick so well.
II. E. Stevens, plant pathologist
to the University of Florida Ex
tension Division, gives the follow
ing directions for making the so
lution :
"The solution is made from cop
per carbonate, ammonia, and wa
ter. The ammonia and carbonate
can be had from houses dealing
in fungicids or from wholesale
drug companies. Small quanti
ties may be had lrom local drug
stores. The ammonia should test

"Make a thin paste of 5 ounces
of the copper carbonate by adding
water. Dilute 3 pints ot the
strong ammonia with water to 2
gallons. Use a wooden vessel.
Add the paste of copper carbonate
to the ammonia water and allow
the whole to stand an hour or two,
or over night.A deep blue solution
will result when all the copper
carbonate that will disolve has
gone into the solution. The blue
solution should be poured off care
fully so that none of the remain
ing sediment will be carried over.
If any of them are into the solu
tion as it goes into the spray tank
they will wear the pump.

which believed in the possibility of
"Enough water should be added
to the two gallons of stock solu
tion to make 50 gallons. The so
lution will then be ready for use
The strong stock solution must not
be placed in the tank befor.e it is
diluted. It is caustic and will
corrode the brass parts of the
pump."
Anthracnose Demands
Action
Protnpt
" Anthracnose in groves of citrus
fruits is caused by the same fun
gus that causes withertip. There
fore, in groves where withertip is
prevalent, anthracnose may be ex
pected. The disease is manifest
ed by dark colored sunken patch
es occurring in the skin of the
fruit. The darkened spots may
be regular or irregular in outline.
The lesions may occur as a num
ber of small spots no larger than
a pin head or they may involve
a large portion of the fruit.
According to 1MI. Rolfs.dean of
the University of Florida College
of Agriculture, the first sign of
the disease is dropping fruit. This
is particularly true of grapefruit
and to a lesser degree of tanger
ines and round oranges. The dis
ease rarely appears on the fruit
before it colors except in some
cases. It may attack tangerines
before the fruit colors. Fruit on
weak or poorly nourished trees is
especially susceptible.
There is not much danger of
anthracnose if the dead wood has
been pruned to eliminate wither
tip. If this pruning has been neg
lected the fruit should be watch
ed closely. Dean Rolfs suggests
that weekly inspections be
made in any event to be sure that
the disease does not develop.
Ammoniaical solution of copper
carbonate isrecommended for con
trol. The spraying must be
promp and thoro if it is to give
protection. Every part of the
fruit must be moistened but not
drenched. To do other than ef
ficient spraying is useless. Keep
the solution from the leaves and
branches as much as possible. Re
peat it in ten days or two weeks.
Results will show in about four
weeks.
Sweet Potato Caterpillar At Work
Reports from various parts of
the state indicate that sweet po
tato caterpillars are at work. In
some fields they are numerous e
nough to demand attention. J. R.
Watson, entomologist to the Uni
versity of Florida Experiment
Station, recommends lead arse
nate for control. One pound of
the powder to 50 gallons of water
will be effective. Two pounds of
lime or, better, the milk obtained
from slaking two pounuds of lime
should be added.
Some farmers report fair results
with the Kansas mixture which is
a poison bait. The materials need-
Jed for this mixture are 20 pounds
of bran, 1 pound of paris green or-
white arsenic, three or four lem
ons or six or eight oranges,
quart of cheap syrup and enough
water to make a stiff mash. The
bran and the poison should be
mixed thoroly. Then the citrus
fruits are grated and mixed with
tho syrup. The two mixtures are
combined and moistened with a
bout two and one half gallons of
water. The mixture is broadcast
ed over the field at sundown. This
method of poisoning is perhaps
not so effective as as the one rec
ommended by Mr. Watson, where
the poison is applied directly to
the vines.
The fall army worm is also re
ported m some parts of the state.
Tho same methods recommended
for the caterpillar will control
this pest.
Escaped Negro Convict Re-Cap
tured Here
Town Marshall J. II. Lipscomb,
on .Thursday of last week, captur
ed a negro convict who had es
caped from McCormick's camp
near La Belle and he will receive
the $100.00 reward offered in such
cases. The negro's name is Fred
erick Jenkins, alias Frank Baxter,
and he had been sent up from Du
val county for fifteen years for
manslaughter. This was his sec
ond escape, and he is regarded as
a desperate fellow. He was found
hiding under the deck of a lighter
on the bay. Not knowing where
he belonged, Marshall Lipscomb
took him to the state prison farm
at Raiford, where he was identi
fied. He was brought back Sun-
lay and returned to LaBclle Tues
day.

Corn In Florida
Eight years ago upon our first
visit to Florida, we laughed out-
ight when several gentlemen told
us corn can be grown profitably
here. We covered a great deal of
territory on that trip, and while
the few fields of corn we saw had
cen gathered, it could be easily
seen trom the small stalks that
very little com was taken from
the stalks. Not so today. It has
cen thoroughly demonstrated
that much of the land will grow
the very best of corn. Only yes
terday we saw several fields with-
m a few miles of Arcadia that con
tains corn which will rival the
:est fields of the north. It is not
an uncommon thing to hear of

GERMANS LOSE
TO THE ALLIES
SOME IMPORTANT POSITIONS
ON THE SOMME FRONT
More Than Five Thousand Taken
Prisoner by the British and
French Russian and
Italian Gains
London, Eng. The Anglo-
French forces have driven then
lines forward and captured impor
tant German positions on the
Somme front.
The village of Soyecourt and
part of the village of Vermando
villers have been stormed while
seemingly more important still,
the French have made fresh prog
ress cast of the village of Forest,
one ana one-r.aii mnes souineast
of the railroad town of Combles
a gain which, taken with the cap
ture of Guillemonte on Sunday,
apparently renders Combles un
tenable. More than 5,000 Ger
mans have been made prisoners
north and south of the Somme
during the last two days.
On the British right wing prog
ress is reported north of Falfe
mont farm, while a German count
er-attack northwest of Moquet
farm was repulsed. In the Ver
dun sector Paris records a fresh
gain near Fleury.
Berlin in admitting the claims
of British and French success n
the fighting of Sunday in the Som
me region, says the battling over
the eighteen-mile front from Beau
mont to the Somme was one of tho
greatest ferocity. The Germans
held their ground at Thiepval,
north of Poizores, and near Gin
chy," but Guillemont vllia and
Wood were lost as likewise was
Ginchy, but a counter-attack of
the Germans won back a portion
of the latter town.
Again there is heavy fighting
on the front in Russia west end
southwest of Lutsk, and north of
Zborow and near Brzebany, in
Galicia, with the Russians general-
y the aggressors. Petrograd con
troverts the assertion of Berlin
that tho Russians obtained only
ocal successes near Brzezany, by
the declaration that the Russians
won a victory over the Teutons
lere and took 2,641 prisoners. In
tho Carpathian region, according
to Petrograd, the Russians have
captured an entire series of
heights and are advancing to the
Hungarian frontier.
Along the Transylvania front
the Rumanians continue to press
their advantage against theAus-tro-IIungarians.
They have cap
tured several additional towns
and are said to be bombarding
the town of Ilerniannstad, which
is second in importance only to
Kronstadt. The German and Bul
garian forces are attacking along
the entire front between Dozrud
ja and Bulgaria. Near Koemar,
Berlin reports, the Rumanians
were driven back with the loss of
700 men taken prisoner.
In Albania the Italian forces
east of Alvona have taken the
villages of Kutai and Brizar and
Monte Gradist.
The Germans have surrendered
to the British in Dar-es-Salam.

Considerable flighting is in
progress in the Austro-ltalian

Farmers sometimes wonder
what they caii do for their boy to
make him stay on the farm. Givo
him a financial interest in tho
farm end send him to the state
agricultural college when he is
old enough. If he starts soon e
nough he can save enough money
from his share in the farm crops
to pay his own way. However,
his start will depend largely on
his parents. He must be encourag
ed before he is large enough to
form his own determination.
