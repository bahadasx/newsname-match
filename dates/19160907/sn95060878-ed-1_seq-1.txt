Dear Friend.
I take a great deal of pleasure in
writing you that my nomination papers
nave been filed with the Secretary of
State, and that I am now a full fledged
candidate for the nomination of Gov
ernor of the State, subject to eceiv
ing a majority of the Democratic votes
cast at the primaries to be held on
September 12, 1916.
The campaign has now fairly open
ed. I intend making a clean cam
paign, vigorously advocating my
claims to the franchise of the people
and standing squarely on the record
I have made in Arizona during my 32
years residence, and with your advice
and assistance am certain of receiv
ing the nomination. I should be very
much pleased to hear from you at
any time.
Should I receive the nomination, I
do not fear the result at the general
election in November, for I will face
the enemy with a united Democracy
behind me, and I can assure you that
I will use every means within my
power to keep that Democracy united.
With a united Democracy as we
should and can have, it would be im
possible for the Republicans to elect
a single officer in the state.
If elected Governor 1 will use every
legitimate means to advance the ma
terial welfare of the state and develop
its resources, matters that every citi
zen is vitally interested in.
I am inclosing a brief outline of

some of the policies upon which, I am

will give it your serious consideration.

YUMA, ARIZONA, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7,
(By B. F. Fly)
The following communi
cation . from Congressman
Carl Hayden, our able and
painstaking representative in
the lower branch of Con
gress, .should be hailed with
joy by every land-owner on
the Yuma project, for it Vets
at rest the fears that some
hati, relative to the Rural
Credits bill recently enacted.
and which assures our people
that they .can organize, as
provided by the new" law, and
obtain all the money they
want at not to exceed six per
cent.
Read it carefully, and then
give credit where credit is
due.
Editor Yuma Daily Examiner,
Yuma, Arizona.
My Dear Sir:
I am advised that some unfriendly
critics of the Hollis-Moss Federal
Farm Loan Act have urged that loans
cannot be made on lands within Rec
lamation Projects because of the lien
whiclv the Government holds for un
paid water right charges. In order
to demonstrate that such is not the
case permit me to quote the following
letter which I received some time ago
cji. , a-fff ..jfiSl
1916.
from Hon. Ralph Moss, of Indiana, one
of the authors of the Rural Credit
law:
Hqn. Carl Hayden.
Washington, D. C.
My Dear Mr. Hayden:
, I have your favor making inquiry
asjto the scope .of the Rural Credit
law. and its application to include
farmers who own , farms under our
various Reclamation projects. ,1 re
call very distinctly your interest in
this phase of the law during the, time
we were drafting its terms. I then as-
GOOD FOR THE CROPS.
(Newark Jiveuin News)
sured you that, we were choosing the your attention to the precise lan-
! language of the proposed statute so
as to make it apply to such , cases as
you have in mind, viz: where settlers
hold title to lands but aeainst which
J holding the government has a lien for
assessments representing water rights loan on lands within irrigation pro
or privileges. T still affirm that any jects until all assessments are fully
fair interpretation of the statute will j paid. The Federal. Reserve law per-
verify my statement as to the purpose
of its farmers. This question was pre
sented very forcibly by you and by
ether representatives of our Western
states.
I was vitally interested in this par
ticular question because we have in
Indiana very extensive Drainage Dis
tricts where the State advances the
money to make the improvements and
is given a first lien against the lands;
eo secure the repayment of the money
so advanced. The State sells bonds
and then collects semi-annually from
the farmers Interested when other

taxes are collected, installments to
apply on retiring bonds. These pay
ments extend over a period of ten or
twenty years. We have in ourdrain
age districts practically analogous
cases to your Western irrigation pro
jects. I feel perfectly confident that
in all "instances where the title vests
in the farmer and no other mortgage
has been placed against the land that
the owner can mortgage his land for
any one of the purposes recognized in
the law.
In this connection, I beg to call
guage in the Rural Credits law as
compared with that of the Federal
Reserve law. I am .aware that there
has been a decision rendered to the
effect that National Banks may not
mits .National -Banks to loan on "im
proved and unincumbered" farm
lands. The term "unincumbered" has
been held to mean lands without legal
assessments such as unpaid irrigation
assessments. Section 12 of the Rural
Credits law uses the term "first mort
gage"; we did not pin our faith to the
vague term "unincumbered." A mort
gage is a mortgage; it is not taxes or
legal asesssments which constitutes a
lien against land; but, in order that
no misapprehension can arise, in the
