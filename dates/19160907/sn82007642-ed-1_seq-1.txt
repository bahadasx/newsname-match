Csnltdente Reunion Soma Thoughts
Suggested.
The 23rd Annual Reunion of
Camp Nimrod Triplott;No. 1.173
" met in Boone, N. C, on the 17th
of August, 1916, with 31 mem
bers present the first day and 25
on the second, who followed Lee,
Jackson, Bragg, Johnson" and
others during the 60's, through
' the rain, snow, wind anI cold,
averaging from 70 to 93;years
of age. All who were present' were
cheerful and in fairly goodjiealth,
but showing the frosts pjkmany
winters, with their head silvered
o'er and their once manly forms
stooped and drawn, tfieir steps
slow and most of them" support
ed by canes; some nearly blind,
while others were almost
entirely deaf.
We had a good, Bocial time
with each other, and several
good andresses were made, and
enjoyable talks by the comrades
. each day.
Since our last Reunion there
have been seven of the members
of the Camp called over the Riv
er of Death, and in a very few
years there will be none of the
veterans left to meet in Reunion
on this earth.
It is admitted by the world and
all lair-minded men, that the
cause for which the Southern sol
diers fought and suffered for four
long years was just and right.
With their fathers, mothers and
the Southern bmen standing be
hind them as 'a solid rock, has
mail this Southland what it is
lodoy. It is admitted that the

Sideathat there is a home in

us would not meat with a hearty
welcome, and the greatest possi

they are 'back numbers.' Only
on election years, when the poli
ticians and the candidate want
their vote, they will laud the old
Boldiers to the skies and say "I
feel like pulling off my hat to an
,old Confederate soldier. But

Hunting Experience of Harrison Aldridge.
J Y L. D. LOWE.
Harrison Aldndge was not on
ly a noted hunter but he was al
so a lover of nature, and his
lonely strolls through theifor
ests enabled him to observe the
great works of Nature.
In speaking on one occasion of
how the different kinds of ani
mals would orev UDon others.
and how different species of birds
would prey chiefly upon others,
and the different defenses they
would make if attacked, he spoke
of his personal observation in re
gard to an attack made bv a
bald eagle upon a numlArof wild
turkeys. On a pleasant evening
late in the fall he waj going
through the forest, al all na
ture seemed to be silenft, and on
reaching a cliff fringed with lau
rel and ivy, he condoled to rest.
He did not remain ldfng, howev
er, until he heard af rustling in
the dry leaves somejdistance be
low the cliff, and After looking
for some time he slw a number
of wild turkeys coming over the
ridge into the flatfbelow wterehe
was, and appeanll to be coming
nearer, lying on the ground as
quietly as possible and thinking
that he would soon get in a shot.
After waiting until he thought
the turkeys were nearly within
the range of his rifle, he heard a
roaring whichlie at first did not
understand, and upon lookingup
he saw a large bald eagle descen
ding immediately over some of
the turkeys;.1hen all at once the
turkeys rusted together making
agreatnoifc, and when they
collected together they stood e
rect, wfth $ieir tails together and
heads pointed out, as though
they were ready to receive battle
from the hands of their mighty
enemy. The eagle swerved a little
to one side and lit on the ground
a short distance awav, and ap
peared to be in doubt as to what
he would do, while the turkeys
kept ufl their frightful noise. Af
ter remaining on the groud for
perhafis ten minutes, the eagle
arosefrom the ground and lit up
on tile limb of a dead tree near
the cliff, but Harrison was not
willkjg to take chances and see
whit other effort the eagle would
mate to appease his hunger, so
h&quietly raised his rifle to his
slioulder and at the crack of the
gun, the great bird closed his
wings and dropped near the base
of the tree, and the turkeys wing
ed their way to a distgnt hill.
Y hile the eagle was perched up
on the limb of the dead tree per
hapse contemplating the unique
i.flefense the turkeys had resorted
to to thwart his assault, or what
would be his next step to supply
his wants, he had no thought
that the man of the forest was
lying in wait and would be t h e
means of his destruction; but
Harrison knew that the death of
this bird would mean the preser
vation of the lives ',ot countless
numbers of others of the feather
ed species, as well as lambs, pigs
and other small animals.

FOiEY KIDNEY PIUS
Bo Damned Either Way.
Bristol Aerald-Courier.
Republicans as well as Demo
crats who are taking note of the
common trend of criticism of
President Wilson, indulged in by
Republican politicians, must be
reminded most frequently of the
old saying, "You'll be damned if
you do, and you'll be damned if
you don't."
Take for instance the Presi
dent's Mexican policy. Not long
ago it looked as if intervention
in Mexico would have to come,
and then the Republican politi
cians said that the President was
preparing to plunge this coun
try into war with Mexico because
he realized that that 1 was the
only thing that would re elect
him. That was not true, of
course. President wilson was see
king all the time to find an hon
orable means of averting war
with Mexico. And now that there
is a fair prospect of a peaceful
settlement of our Mexican trou
bles, the Republican politicians
are saying that the President
fears to intervene in Mexico be
cause he believes it would defeat
him for re-election. That's not
true, either.
Then there is the lion. Boies
'enrose, stand-pat Republican
Senator from Pennsylvania. He
has been talking a lot, and we
will let him stand as sepresenta-
tive of a class of Republican poli
ticians because be is prominent
in his party and we happen to
remember some of the things he
has been saying. A few weeks a-
go Penrose thought this country
was headed straight for war; he
was sure he would be beaten be
cause we were not prepared for
war; and he laid the blame for
our fdefenseless condition upon
President Wilson although the
President found the country in a
defenseless condition af 50 years
of Republican rule. But now the
Administration's program has
been completed, and Congress
has appropriated a few hundred
million dollars for the hational
defrnse, Penrose and other Re
publican politicians are accusing
the Administration of squander
ing the Nation's money and are
holding the President responsi
ble for the alleged extravagance.
Sppaking of extravagance, Can
didate Hughes has been making
that charge ogainst the Admin
istration, a fact which reminds
New York newspapers that this
same Hughes once was Governor
of that State. These newspapers
recall that the annual expenses
of the State Government in the
final year of Governor Flower's
administration was less than
$10,000,000; while in the final
year of the administration of his
immediate successor, Governor
Hughes, the expenses were near
ly $40,000,000. The annual in
crease during Governor Hughes'
administration averaged more
than $3,000,000, while during
the administrations of five or
six of his predecessors it was less
than $1,000,000.
But Candidate nuges, whose
administrations as Governor of
New York were notoriously ex
travagant, will show the people
that he is the greatesteconomist
that ever happened, if they will
make him President. And if the
Pepublican politicians had been
in power for the last three years
they would ha ve atoned for their
long neglest of the national de
fense by adopting a program of
DreDaredness that would have
made the present Administra
tion's preparedness programme
look like thirty cents, and they
wouldn't have allowed it tb cost
the country a dollar.

Tbis Is Real Relief Work.
Lenoir Topic
The most important relief work
done in Caldwell county during
the flood period by individual,
society or soulless corporation
was" the improvised freight sys
tem furnished by the C. & N. W.
Ry. from July 20 to Aug. 28th
to supply the needs of the people
from Lenoir to Mortimer and In
termediate points.
With no locomotiye across the
Catawba river except the one
storm-locked at Edgemont at
first it looked like a hopeless
case for the C. & N. W. manage
ment to offer any relief to a thou
sand people cut off from the out
side world by rail and even their
public highways washed away.
Superintendent Crosby at Ches
ter soon thought out or adopt
ed a plan. The track from Lsnoir
to Colletsville and other points
north was soon cleared, local de
pot agent Hanks was instructed
to requisition section foreman
John Cox and his crew and mo
tor car to undertake the task of
relief, and rigid instructions weie
issued that they make no charg
es so long as the people were in
need of the road unable to give
regular service. A schedule of two
trips daily was arranged, and
this to be increased if necessary.
Sometimes two such cars were
coupled together and this gave a
carryingcapacity of 5000 pounds
Thus for 40 days and sometimes
far into the weary hours of the
night these quaint little freight
ers and their faithful crews din
a gratuitous service for a people
providentially bereft of all luxu
ries and comfortt and in many
cases the actual bread of life.
With the sound of the nearest
locomotive whistle 20 mile a-
way, these tiny cars took their
long sweep over a broad and des
olate country, and the once
strange noise of the gasoline en
gine now broke the monotony
and was as welcome as the sono
rous chiuie whistle on a sixty
ton engine. To tho man from the
city the contiiiuousexhaustfroin
the five horse power engine soun
ded like an eleetric hammer on a
twenty story New York sky-scraper;
the fellow from the back
woods at first thought it was a
yellow hammer nharpening his
bill on a hollow chestnut limb,
but it spelt relief to nil and was
a pleasant sound under the cir
cumstances. When the events of the p a s t
few weeks have all been sumed up
and a sensible man takes a
thoughtful look he must admit
the railroads have done a great
work and in some cases accom
plished wonders.

Forethought.
People are learning that a lit
tle forethought oitea saves them
a big exnenne. Here is an in
stance: L W Archer, Caldwell, O.,
writes: "1 do not believe that our
family has been without Cham
berlain's Colic, Cholera and Diar
rhoea Remedy since wecoinmpuc
ed keeping house years ago.
When we go on an extended vin
it we take it with U?." Obtaina

Playing War.
Aahevllle Citizen.
Sometimes we think that for
eign nations must greatly appre
ci atethe splendid frankness where
with our army and navy author
ities reveal the state of unpre
paredness through which this
country has so fortunately blun
dered. For the last seven or eight
months American newspapers
have told almost daily how woe
fully unprepared this country has
been and is, and the great powers
of the world have been all but in
vited to come over and take
that which is waiting for them
in a silver platter. With the re
cent passage of the great nayal
appropriation which it is stated,
will give the United States a
great navy, second only to that
of Great Britain, public confi
dence and a feeling of salety were
partially restored; but now we
are told that an enemy fleet
sould easily land invading forces
on the American coast within
twenty miles of New York any
day and before we get our great
er navy. Well, well; what a world
of dreadful alarms this is, to be
sure. No man knows when he
goes to sleep at night whether or
not his country will be colonized
by morning, and we will be lucky
if the kaiserdoesnotswoopdown
on .the United States before we
get our new navy into shape and
run away with it in his pocket.
All of which is born of the re
cent war game wherein a 'Ted"
fleet and a "blue" fleet were en
gaged in deadly encounter. It
seems that the "red" squadron
finally tagged the "blue", and
all America shivered because one
fleet succeeded in dodging the
other and landed without oppo
sition. Now, naval maneuvers
are well enough in their way, and
war games doubtless teach prof
itable lessons, but the average
landlubber, admitting that ho is
grten to an appalling extent, has
sense enough to know that there
is a tremendous difference be
tween play war and tho real
thing. Tho most annoying fea
ture of genuine naval warfare is
that an invading enemy will not
follow .the rules laid down in tie
ganio of tag, and since none may
know what tactics enemy ships
would pursue, it is impossible 1o
anticipate them even with the
most carefully staged naval ma
neuvers. The recent practice, how
ever, seems to have demonstra
ted the impressive fact that ade
quate coast protection may be
found in an efficient scouting
fleet. Without being asked for
our opinion, we may add that a
few good airships are just as nec
essary as floating scouts, and
they will doubtless be added to
tho naval defense of the future.
