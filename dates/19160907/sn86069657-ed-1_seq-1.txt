Locating Estill County Road. t
The Powell County Road Oom
mission was in the city today and
wont over the proposed Estill
county -inter-county seat road
They crossed the river at the Old
Forge mill site and went over the
. road to the Estill county line.
They then came back to P. D
Todd's and ran over the Powell's
Valley road to where it intersects
" tho Olark county line road at the
Brush oreek Crossinc, thinking of
- building the road that way. While
thiffroad is a little further from
the central portion of town, it
can pepUt on good grade, and by
connecting with the Olark coun
ty road will save the building of
about three-fourths mile of road
and'a bridge.-
The route now used to Estill
county is the best grade and is
the one most desired by the Oom
" mission and the people, and it is
oiily. n question of economy that
cives the Powell's Valley road
-fconsideratidu. There are, how
ever, "just as njauy people served
on this route as the level route,
but with the Winchester and Ir
vine roads improved, no person
li.ving .on the Powell's Valley
road w,ou!d be more than one
half mile from one of these im
proved roads.
The Commission Will not build
pikep. within itself on any of. the
roads at this tlrrtp Unless Unpeo

agreement -the Commission will
.put up dollar for dollar 'with the
people,, pro.vided the- people put
up as niuah as $500 or more per
mileTor the road to be improved.
In this way and in this, w ay alone
can a turnpike be built on any
road. This ia a very fair adjust
meut Of the apportioning of the
bond money. Work will begin
on this road soon as definite ar
rangements can be made.
Many go to Hear Hughes.
Quite a .bunch of Olay City Re
publicans went ,to Lexington
Tuesday to attend the Republi
can speaking-and rally. Ex-Governor
Hughes seems to be at
tractive tp his followers in this
county from tho way they flock
ed to Lexington to hear their
chief. Some mischievous Demo
crats seeking to" further terrify
them in their doubts, remarked
that they would not get to hear
Hughes again before the election,
nor, hear of him after the elec
tion. But then you know some
oft-these Clay City Democrats do
get uaUghty ut times.
Meeting of Trustees

The-taxpayer's all watrt improve,

way "to get-these things is to come
.forward and pay their tax into
the lank city treasury.
