WILSON'S WORDS KEPT
PEACE, SAYS GREGORY
Attoreny General Gregory,
speaking here tonight, attribut
ed the properity the Nation is
now enjoying to the President's
success in maintaining peace,
defended his policy of restarting
to "words and not deeds" in con
troverisies with foreign countri
es, and denounoed Hughes for
his attack on the Wilson Admin
istration.
"As part of his Administra
tion, Mr. Gregory said, I here
and now announce that" so lQng
as President Wilson presides
over the destines of this Nation
so lorg will words and not deeds
be resorted to in keeping peace
with the nations until words
have ceased to be effective and
peace' can no longer be honor
ably maintained. If this be
treason to the American ]$ople,
let candidate Hughes make the
most of it!
"He says that deeds' and! not
words' should have been resort
ed to. What deeds has he to
offer to-day in lieu of the words
which have kept this country at
peace?"
NORTH DAKOTA GETS $600,
000,00 PACKING PLANT
That the much discussed pack
ing plant for North Dakota is
likely to soon become a reality
is indicated by the fact that art
icles of incorporation have been
filed with the Secretary of State
for the Northern Packing Com
pany, a North Dakota organiza
tion capitalized for $500,00.00.
Those in charge of the plan*
of the organization promise a
business for North Dakota which
will go far towards dfyeloping
the diversified farming which we
so badly need, as the company
will provide a home market for
North Dakota hogs, cattle and
sheep. The plans of the com
pany also include the making of
the same into every broad orga
ization in that it is planned to
allot mi|ll blocks of stock (to
the different sections of the state
not permitting any individual or
group of individuals to gain con
trol of the company. The plan
ai|so contemplate the elimina
tion of the great promotional ex
pense which usually accompan
ies the floating of large proposi
tions. There will be no water
in the stock of the Northern
Packing Company. It will be
owned and operated by the citi
zens of the state- The business
of tin? new orgmv't1 i' as set
forth in its articles. is leal in

FOILED IN ROBBING

Barney was visited by burglars
and auto thieves last Wed
nesday eveaing, when an attempt
was made to rob the postofl'ice
and $hen making away with a
new six-cylinder Studebaker that
was purchased here Monday by
Mr. August Moyer. The thives

to tools and then proceeded to
break into the post office in the
Mathias building, but were in
terrupted while smashing in a
window, by J. L. Rehmet, who
lives just across the street.
Nohting was missing at the office
and no harm was done other
than a damaged window front.
It was not discovered until the
next day that Mr. Moyer's ma
chine was missing. Scouts were
set on the trail and the authori
ties notified at once- Up to the
time of going to press no trace
of the machine was found.—

FROSTS REDUCE THE
CORN GERMINATION
•Seed corn does not germinate
90 per cent or better i3 not fit
to be planted for the production
of ears. Germination is the
one factor that regulates the val
ue of seed com of any class or
variety. Even fodder corn seed
ought to h^v-9 a high germina
tion testing power. A false im
pression prevails tiliat fodder
corn does not lieed to have a
high germination record like ear
com seed.
Killing frost on standing corn
is almost sure to impair the ger
mination of the seed. It is better
to cut too early than too late- If
cut and shocked when about Oft
per cent of the ears are just well
dented, the kernels will fill out
properly in the shock and the
germination will be preserved.
A
killing frost wihje the corn is
standing may almost destroy the
germination power. The in
jury will he relatively larger as
the crop is less mature.
ANOTHER HIGHWAY
THROUGH THE STATE
Arrangements have been com
pleted for tapping this state wit
another highway wilieh will run
from Galveston, Texas to Win
nipeg- Manitoba, Dr. J. C. Corn
ell, chairman of the highway d.:
partment of the Chamber of Com
meree, Judge W. W. Brown, Gen
era! Attorney for the Missouri,
Texas and Kansas Railway Com
pany, and J- McXighl, all of
Parsons, Kansas, conferred with
officials of the North Dakota
Development. League at Grand
Forks on tin? matter of bringing
the road through this county.
Support has been assured for
the project and it is now a cer
tain that within the next few
months, the entire route will be
marked out arid preparations
will be completed to begin the
work of constructing the high
way.
Beginning at Galveston and
proceeding north, the most im
portant through which the high
way will run are Dallas, Texas
Muskogee, Oklahoma Pearsons,
Kansas Leavenworth. Kansas
Kansas City. Omoha Council
Bluffs, Sioux City, Sioux Falls,
OrfonvMle. Wahjpeion, Fargo,
Grand Forks and Winnipeg.
The cities along the line have
been visited by the committee
and acording to Dr. Cornell, the
organization is now complete
and the success of the venture is
isureit. Seven military post will
be connected bv the new high
way. and because of this fad, it
is believed that. Federal aid will
be given.
A road like this one promises
to be is an excellent thing for
this state owing to the fad-llr.it
it, will have a tendency to bring
many hundreds of southern peo
ple in to this section. They will
itecome interested in North Dak
ota and some will invest money
in lar.d and stock, which is al
way- a help to any community.
THE WAHPETON TIMES
WAHPETON, RICHLAND COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 7th, 1916.
ONE-FOURTH OF LAND
SHOULD BE IN CORN
One-fourth of the tillable land
in Minesota should be planted to
corn every year- Unfavorable
conditions in 1915 should not dis
courage Minnesota farmers, for
in the last five years the aver
age corn crup has produced
twice as much feed to the acre
as the average oats crop. At
FOODS FOR GROWTH
Young animals must have but
ter fat or the fat found in eggs,
to grow- At the Wisconsin Ex
periment Station an experiment
was carried on with rats. When
there was neither butter fat lor
fat from eggs in the food, the
young rats did .not grow. Even
when olive oil, cottenseed oil and
tallow or lard was supplied in
place of the butter fat, they made
no growth. It was also found
that alfalfa leaves contain a good
deal of this substance. This in
a measure- explains why milk is
so good for growing pigs and why
alfalfa pasture gives such good
results.
THE PRESIDENT'S CONSERVA
TION POLICY
The record of the Wilson ad
ministration in the conservation
of our public domain and re
sources will meet with the cordial
approval of those Americans who
have seen with regret vast areas
of public lands pass into the
greedy hands of monopolists,
billions of tons of coal, the pro
perty of all the people, transfer?
ed to a favored few and other
public resources frittered away,
and who recalls the frauds and
scandals that made these great
national blessings a source of
shame.

should be planted in 1917, and not only a question sticking it
there will be needed 500,000 out but of winning.
bushels of seed corn to plant
this acreage. It will add 15
000,000 bushels to next year's
crop if the seed is selected from
the field and safely stored be
fore cold weather.
In sharp contrast with some of
its predecessors stands the Wil
son record. No fraud or trick
ery or even charge or rumors of
fraud or scandal has occurred.
All of the vast territory and ricli
es of the nation have been con
served for the benefit of the na
tion, the needs of the future con
sidered and provided for and mil
lions of acres made available for
homestead entry.
The record is without a blur
and of marked energy and ac
complishment.
Scott, Ferris, the Oklahoma
Congressman who is the, author
of the new Homestead I.aw and
\vho as chairman of the House
Committee o«i Public Lands has
borne a most active part in the
conservation legislation of the
Wilson administration, in an

DIVERSIFIED FARMING
Diversified farming and small

Dakota by M. J. Wright? of Wood
stock, Illinois, who was in Grand
Forks recently-
Mr. Wright is president of tin:

County Illinois, and is thoro.ug

all kinds. Since his arrival in
North Dakota he has been care
fully investigating farming con
ditions in

By splitting up the farms in
this section and using diversi
fied methods. Mr. Wright believes
that better results would be ob
tained in North Dakota and a
more properous future would be
assured.
He points out that the wonder
ful soil fertility, no part of the
country is better adapted to the
growing of clover, alfalfa, and
other leiume crops, which will
mean the production of cattle and

way in which the population
would bo increased and better

might turn sour when used for
