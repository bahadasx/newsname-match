News From Maui Says Man
Under Suspicion Was
Caught After Chase
POCKETS RIFLlb BUT
MONEY APPARENTLY LEFT
Gold and Checks Amounting
to $65 Reported Found
on Clothing . v
News reached Honolulu this morn
ing: that a Japanese laborer is under
arrest on Maul, suspected of the mur
der of George O. Cooper of Han a,
whose body was found early yester
day morning shot through the back.
That the Japanese was arrested
Wednesday just before the Claudlne
sailed from Maul, la the report brought
here today by B, F. Vlckers, salesman
for Tbeo. II. Davies & Co. .
The Information brought today is
that shortly after Cooper left his home
for the' plantation office. Cooper's
brother-in-law started to go up to the
home to see that the children's clothes
got down to the Claudlne all tight, as
the children were coming to Honolulu
to attend school. As he nearer the
place where -the railroad cuts across
the main road he saw a Japanese fid-
-.fi j
inr a eray-norse up ue.rwirwu
When the Japanese saw him he whip
ped the horse Into a gallop and rode
. ; rapidly towards-Keanae.
1 Later when the body waa found, the
: brother-in-law remembered the Japa
nese, who -was pursued and. arrest
; ed on the ditch trail half way to Kea
' nae. -: ' - '-- ..
Whether this Japanese, whose name
: is not known" here, waa Implicated in
the murder had not been ascertained
at the time the Claudlne left,' but
Vlckers heard that he had. formerly
'.worked on the plantation, but at the
; time of the killing was supposed to
rLe at another part of the Island,
r Vlckers said that '-Cooper, ordinarily,
1 f . took, the-rall road to tho vZ& a.:.at
Tor eeteral days previcins V hM.taui
' had fone.fcy tlie rcUr.rcad; which
r9A much longer. That; the killing
r waa not for rotbery la "also believed
In Maul as 160.20 in gold ' and silver
and a check for 475 wer found scat
tered . about his body It is also be
lieved that a fight took place between
Cooper and his assailant, - as the
' ground was torn op about the place
where the body was found and Coop
er's hat was found more than SO feet
away.v The horse which. Cooper rode
was found browsing In the sugar cane
a short distance from the. body, and
thla raises the question' of whether
Cooper was on the horse or had dis
mounted to parley before he was shot.
Wednesday was Cooper's 43rd birth
day and a dinner had been, planned
for the evening. . v
Report Japanese Identified
According to Captain R. Williamson
of the Inter-Island steamer Kalulani,
w hich ' arrived this t morning . from
liana, having left that 'port at 6:20
last evening, reports that Cooper was
murdered by the Japanese for revenge
were in circulation at Hana.
I was told that the Japanese waa
positively identified by John Pokini,
a blacksmith's helper on te planta
tion, as a laborer who had left the
plantation about 12 months ago, and
who. when be left, had sworn he
would 'come back and kill someone,
said Captain Williamson.
The story being told in Hana yes
terday was to the effect that the Jap
anese, w.hose name I was not: told,
had been brought "up as an orphan
from childhood by a Hawaiian family.
He is said to be a pure-blooded Jap
nnPRA and when arrested had a gun
on him. so T waa'told : J
The captain, added that the Inquest
over Cooper's body held yesterday
showed evidences of a struggle... "One
of the dead man's , eyes wrs bruised,
and his shoulder alro showed a livid
bruise, indicating that there waa prob
ably a struggle; before the shots were
fired. The captain also corroborated
other feporta concerning money found
in Cooper's " .clothes, amounting to
abcut $65 In gold and checks. -.This
would apparently disprove that rob
bery was the motive of the murder:

Cooper, the best and most widely
known man In all the Hana district, is
dead. Was It foul play? Waa It hate?
Was It spite? What was it that
; brought this violent death and this
sudden disaster to wife and dear ones?
At an early hour this morning his
bloody body was found in a secluded
spot beside the railroad tracks of the
local plantation railroad, Workmen
passing near the apot found his horse
riderless and wandering about and
took it home. Search was at once
made to find what had happened. The
horse nad fallen and thrown its rider
but recently, and fears -of , similar
trouble were keen. .- '

, "Link" Not Receptive
Joseph J. Fern will not receive the
support r of the Democratic party as
candidate for mayor of Honolulu. This
is the declaration, of, a prominent
Bourbon and party leader who is In
close touch with tne wrork of the or
ganization. -
I do not care to go any further into
the matter," this Bourbon added when
pressed for the party's reasons for de
clining to support "Uncle Joe."
If Lincoln L ("Link") McCandless
is beaten by Prince Kuhio in the fight
for the delegateship, It Is understood
that he will be put forward by the
Democrats as a candidate for mayor.
"I am' not considering running for
mayor," McCandless declared today,
when asked if there was a possibility
of his being a candidate..
With regard to the report that no
one on Hawsli has yet come forward
as a candidate for senator from that
Island on the Democratic ticket, Mc
Candless says he has heard nothing
definite.
"I have advised a little on Kauai,
but not on Hawaii or Maui," he says.
Local Democrats will gather at
Aala park at 7:30 o'clock next Sat
urday evening for a big ratification
rally. Although the speakers have not
yet been definitely chosen, it is be
lieved that McCandless "will deliver
