Y. I. iPOPULAR
"Mike" Reports That Border Boys
Take Achantage of Conveni-
ences Offered by "Y."
Camp Conditions Constantly Being Im-
proved and the Boys Are
Well Fed and Happy.
Camp Llano Grande, Aug. 3, 1916.
And the "war" goes merrily on.
War in name only, but the boys de
light in referring to this expedition as
the big war of 1916, and already the
camp venders have their medals and
badges for sale. On these it is blaz
oned forth to the world that he wear
er is a veteran of the 1916 Mexican
expedition to the border. The so
called war has developed into a gi
gantic training camp for thousands of
young men and is one of the results
of all our preparedness talk. Drill,
hike, eat and sleep are the four big
items of interest in this camp and we
get plenty of all of them. Part of the
First regiment is now doing border
patrol duty and we presume it is only
a question of time until we get some
of this same work. And at that it
would be a much desired change as
the steady routine of camp life is
bound to get monotonous and a change
of any kind is welcomed by the officers
and men.
The new mess halls are now com
plete and are one of the biggest im
provements we have. In these build
ings the cooks can do better work and
more conveniently, and the boys can
enjoy their hard earned meals with
some degree of comfort. Cooking and
eating right out in the open naturally
attracts and draws millions of flies
a hot climate and oftimes it was
touch and go to see whether you
could ge the food before the flies got
it. Sergt. Cordmer was the master
carpenter in charge of the mess hall
building and he and his crew of car
penters, who were picked from the
company, did a very good job.
An officers' mess hall has also been
built and this will be a big conveni
ence for the company officers, as here
tofore they have eaten their meals in
their tents.
Eugene Kalkman, Second Lieuten
ant, is now stationed at Harlingen,
Texas, with the 26th Inf. Jerry is
plugging for the "exam" and says his
chances are good for getting into the
regular service. He reports very
courteous treatment from his brother
officers of the regular service.
One of the most popular places for
the boys is the Minnesota Y. M. C. A.
"building. This is a good sized building
where the soldiers can go and make
themselves at home. It contains plen
ty of chairs, writing benches, writixig
paper, pens and ink, checkers and dom
inos, books, papers and magazines. In
fact it contains most everything that
the inen need to amuse and entertain
themselves, and also provides ready
means for the boys to write home.
And write they do. It is no uncommon
sight to see every available' writing
space in the large building taken up
by young men in khaki busily engaged
in writing letters back to the dear
ones i" Minnesota. Another good fea
ture of the "Y" is that they make it
a practice to pay off the men right in
the building, and here they have ready
means for sending their money, or
part of it, back home or to their sav
ings bank. This gives the men an
excellent chance to save part of their
money before the camp followers get
a crack at it.
The army mule is very much in evi
dence around this camp now and he
-and the army truck vie with each
other as to who can and will do the
most heavy work for Uncle Sam.
When the roads are good the truck
does better and quicker work than the
mule teams, but when the weather
gets wet and the roads get bad the
army mule comefe into his own and
calmly wallows through the mud and
mire with his heavy load while the
auto truck is hung up in a mud hole
or has slid off the road entirely and
is out of commission. The trucks are
necessary in this army life but the
mule is absolutely indispensable.
Wednesday was Co.'s day on
guard and as usual we were out of luck.
Every other time we had a storm,
but this time it was even worse as it
-was field day and a holiday all over
the border. It was celebrated in the
usual manner with the advertised
added attraction of a balloon ascension
by one of the First Inf. boys who owns
a balloon, but was unable to make it
on account of the wind. The Third
Inf. ball team went to Donna and
played the Iowa Cavalry ball team
and as usual won. Co. isn't rep
resented on the team any more as all
Minn. Historical Society
of our ball players seemed to have
been married men and are now help
ing Princeton win. A bunch of boys
with a wash tub for a drum, can covers
for cymbals, with cans and pans of
various descriptions for volume, and
a bugle and a cornet, and with the
leader carrying a broom stick, and
a banner proclaiming them the reor
ganized Third Inf. band, marched onto
the field. They performed all sorts
of movements and evolutions, and
elicited storms of applause. The real
Third Inf. band is still patiently wait
ing for instruments. They have music
and music racks but can't get any
music from that.
Our hike of last Friday was about
an eight mile one and in heavy march
ing order. A heavy ram on the day
before made the roads a sea of mud
and gumbo, and one slipped back al
most as fast as he went foreward on
the march. Although badly mud-be
spattered and somewhat tired from
their heavy hike through the mud still
the boys came back to camp in good
shape and apparently did not mind
this part of the training as much as
they do some of the rest of the work.
The effects of the training are begin
ning to show wonderful results, and
the men are "hard boiled" now in
every sense of this popular army
phrase.
We have had lots of rain lately.
Get a good shower almost every after
noon, from two to four as a rule.
This makes the work heavier and
causes some discomfort for the men.
Last Friday Sergt. Doane received
word that he had been discharged un
der the married man's clause, and the
same day left for Fort Snelling. Al
Escherisch also left for home the day
before. This leaves only three more
married men in the company who de
sire to get out, and it is only a ques
tion of time until they will be out and
on their way home.
Good southern pine floors have been
laid in all the tents now and this will
be a big help to the men as they can
be more comfortable and clean than
when they were living on a dirt floor.
We presume electric lights and steam
heat for the tents will be the next
move. The lights we could make good
use of. The steam heat clause we are
willing to waive.
A new older is out that the officers
must wear their blouses whenever they
appear outside their tents. This is an
order that pleases Captain Johnson
and Lieutenant Morton. Of course you
may not believe the latter part of this
statementwe don't ourselves.
"Coco" Hanson has been promoted
from mule skinner to artificer to take
the place of Al Escherisch. Corp. Lee
Sanford has also been promoted and
now wears a sergeant's stripes.
Following is a sample of what the
"dough boys" have to eat for a regu
lar army diet:

Next Wednesday the gates to the
fair grounds will be opened for the
Silver Jubilee exposition of the Mille
Lacs county Agricultural society, and
the fair will continue from then until
Saturday evening.
The opening day will be given over
to receiving exhibits and arranging
same. The premiums'offered are very
liberal and the indications are that the
exhibits will even surpass last year's
splendid display. There is scarcely a
farmer in this section, who' has not
something worthy of a prize. Bring in
what you have, and help make the fair
a success.' Elsewhere in this issue appears a
program of sports and attractions.
Horse races, ball games and other con
tests will entertain the multitude,
while stirring music will be discoursed
by the Glendorado and Bock bands.
But the feature attraction will be the
airship flights by Monte Rolfe, one of
the leading aviators in the country,
who will be at the fair on Friday and
Saturday and thrill the throngs with
daring dips and dives. Never before
has such an attractive program been
offered fair visitors.
On Friday Hon. Frank B. Kellogg
will deliver an address at 2 p. m. Mr.
Kellogg will be the next United States
senator from Minnesota, and he is one
of the big men of the country. We
have no doubt but what an immense
throng will greet* the distinguished
Minnesotan, and that he will deliver
an interesting message is a foregone
conclusion.
The officers and committees have at
tended to their duties in a commenda
ble manner, and everything is in
readiness for the opening day of the
biggest and best exposition ever staged
by the Mille Lacs County Agricultural
society. If they have the co-oparation
of the progressive citizens of Prince
ton and vicinity the Silver Jubilee ex
position will certainly be a winner.
Gun Club Scores.
At the regular shoot of the gun
club Sunday morning Joe Mossman
carried off the honors by breaking 22
out of a possible 25. Dr. McRae was
second, shattering 20, and C. E. Hill
third with 19. "Heinie" Plaas had
easy going for the cellar position, get
ting 7. Other scores follow: O. B.
Randall 18 and Lloyd Mallette 15.
At the shoot of a week ago a crack
shot in the employ of the Peters Cor
tridge Co. participated, and he came
within one of hanging up a perfect
score. Dr. Mallette and Joe Mossman
were right after him, missing only 2.
Other scores follow: Dr. McRae 21,
F. H. Bartelt 19, Swan Olson 12 and
W. G. Fredericks 12.
Fall Selection of Potatoes Pays.
It pays to select next year's pota
to tubers from the field at digging
time, better than to select them from
the bin next spring. Here are reasons
why seed selection is more easily tak
en care of now than when the potatoes
are in the bin.
At digging time one can get a good
idea as to the lype and uniformity of
tubers produced under individual vines
which can not be obtained "after the
crop has been put in storage. Seed
should be selected only from vines
producing several uniform, average
sized, true-to-type tubers. Such se
lection can not be practiced when the
seed is selected out of the bin.
Tubers affected with scab, russet
scab, late blight rot, black leg rot and
brown ring discoloration due to wilt
should be discarded. To avoid the
possibility of getting tubers infected
with black leg rot or brown ring dis
coloration, the field should be thor
oughly inspected before the vines
phave dried up. Seed should not be
kept from infected plants, in fact,
wilted plants, together with what
tubers may have been formed on them,
ought to be destroyed.
Plants affected with leaf roll, curly
dwarf and mosaic should be destroyed
and no tubers saved from them. Al
though these diseases do not cause any
visable injury on the tubers, the use
of infected seed will reduce the yield
and finally cause the potatoes to "run
out."
The diseases are described in detail
in Minnesota Station Bulletin No. 158,
which can be obtained on application
to the office of publications, University
Farm, St. Paul, Minn.A. G. Tolaas,
University Farm, St. Paul.
I. O. O. Picnic.
The Odd Fellow and Rebekah picnic
on the banks of the Rum in the Umbe
hocker grove Sunday was a most
pleasant occasion for those in atten
dance.
The committee on arrangements had
attended to their duties in a commend
able manner. Swings and hammocks
were in evidence and the little folks
present enjoyed these features im
mensely. Stakes had been driven into
the ground, also, and pitching quoits,
or rather horse shoes, proved whole
some and entertaining. Fred Manke
and I. Mudgett claimed the champion
ship in this line, although Wm. Bal
dowsky and George Borchard downed
them in the last game of the day.
Some of those present were extremely
accurate, and to win the champion
ship required a display of uncanny
skill. Sam Smith, O. B. Newton, M.
Stacy and Carl Ness were also among
the top-notchers. A tug-of-war with
ten lady Rebekahs holding one end of
the rope, and five Stalwart Odd Fel
lows at the other end would have been
interesting had it not been so one
sided. The Rebekahs hauled the Odd
Fellows all over the lot.
The picnic dinner, which was spread
upon the greensward, was indeed an
appetizing repast. The Rebekahs had
prepared it and there was an abund
ance of substantial eatables. Com
plete justice was done to the dinner
by the hungry outers.
The Odd Fellows and Rebekahs in
variably do things up right, and the
picnic was certainly a happy occasion.
Library Meetings.
The meeting at the armory last
Thursday evening for the purpose of
discussing the advisability of estab
lishing a public library in Princeton
was not as well attended as it might
have been, but a representative gath
ering of citizens was present. Miss
Baldwin, state libarian, addressed the
gathering and impressed those in at
tendance with the benefits to be de
rived from a library.
Several plans were outlined and dis
cussed but no action was taken.
^Miss Baldwin also addressed the
Civic Betterment club Friday after
noon, and favorably impressed her
hearers.
The indications are that in the not
remote future Princeton will be blessed
with a public library, and a project
of this kind should be accorded the
support of all good citizens.
Runaway Accident.
Mr. and Mrs. Leon Bergeron and
little son, Elvero, were painfully
bruised Monday afternoon, when a
team of horses hitched to a buggy,
driven by Mr. Bergeron, became
frightened at an automobile and a
barking dog and ran away. The bug
gy tipped over and all the inmates
were painfully bruised, with the ex
ception of Mrs. Liskey, mother of
Mrs. Bergeron, who escaped unhurt.
The accident took place" on the east
Milaca road, about half a mile south
of the Pohl farm.
An Election Bet.
The first election bet of the season
has been made, and the principals can
not hedge. Fred Murphy of Baldwin
is so confident that President Wilson
will be chosen to succeed himself, that
he has promised I. Martin to ride him
down two blocks of Main street,
Princeton, in a wheel barrow in case
Hughes is elected. On the other hand
if President Wilson is elected Mr.
Ma^in must wheel Fred down Main
street. Fred is really giving odds, as
Mr. Martin out-weighs him.
McClellan Nominated.
A few weeks ago the Union an
nounced that Mr. R. F. McClellan,
formerly of Princeton, was a candi
date for the republican nomination for
the office of supervisor in the fourth
district of Los Angeles county, Cal.
There were four candidates, and Mr.
McClellan, who polled 5,107 votes, was
second on the list and his name goes
on the ballot at the November election.
We sincerely hope that Fred will come
in ahead on the home stretch.
REGULARSWAT-FEST
Princeton Ball Tossers Lose Seven-
Inning Slugging Match by
a 7 to 5 Count.
Visitors Arrive at Five o'ClockA
Home-Run Drive by Wilkes
One of the Features.
It was a tired lot of Princeton ball
tossers that lined up against the Min
neapolis post office team late Sunday
afternoon, and at the end of the con
test the fans were some tired also.
Only seven innings were played and
the final count was 7 to 5 in favor of
the visitors.
Play" did not commence until after
5 o'clock, as the visitors did not arrive
until then. A large auto bus carried
the players, and a goodly percentage
of the Mill City fans to Princeton, and
it was undoubtedly overloaded. At any
rate blow-outs delayed the outfit three
hours or more.
In the meantime Pongo's pastimers
had ample opportunity to warm up,
and warm up they did. For two hours
the boys engaged in strenuous prac
tice, and then sides were chosen and
a regular game started. Five innings
were played before the visitors ar
rived, and by this time the Princeton
performers were in fine shapeto
quit.
Rather than disappoint the loyal
fans, who had remained at the grounds
three hours, Manager Olson concluded
to take the visitors on, although he
well knew that his men had about as
much pep as a well-fed hobo.
Wilkes was on the hill top for
Princeton, and under the circum
stances did remarkably well. He
drove in four of Princeton's five runs
one of his drives being a steaming
home run. Skahen was at the re
ceiving station and performed well.
Swenson and Thonnan were in the
points for the postal men, and got by
in good shape.
N
The visitors started with a curtain
of fire bombardment. Bang! Bang!
Bang! Three blows and four runs Was
the result. Princeton was blanked in
its half, and the Minneapolis men were
retired scoreless in the second.
Princeton broke into the run column
in the second, when Mallette walked
and managed to cross the registering
station before the side was retired.
In the third the visitors added one
to their "total, and Princeton pushed
two over in this round. Umbehocker
was retired, but Jesmer walked, Berg
went down, and Caley walked. With
two x)n Wilkes came to bat, and drove
a ray of hope into the hearts of the
fans by lacing out a scorching double.
Of course Jesmer and Caley counted.
Neither side scored in the fourth,
and the visitors were also blanked in
the fifth, but this stanza saw Prince
ton even the count. With Berg pre
ceding him on the paljhs Wilkes swung
his bludgeon and caught the sphere
fair and square for a smashing four
cushion drive through center field.
It was a clean home run, and brought
the entire crowd to its feet. This end
ed Princeton's scoring, and the visitors
put the game on ice in the sixth by
pushing one over the tabulating rub
ber. Just to make certain the Min
neapolis men added another in the
seventh.
NOTES.
It was an old time slug fest, and
Wilkes was the star in this line.
Had the visitors arrived on time
it is safe to say that a real ball game
would have been played.
Princeton has had the goods this
season, and the boys could have had a
clean record foJ" 1916, as well as not.
Berg was in no condition to play,
but he pluckily stayed in the game.
He turned his ankle during practice,
and was forced to use a crutch Mon
day.
Hunting Season Opens.
The hunting season opened .this
morning, and several nimrods from
the village ventured forth in search of
small game. Prairie chickens are said
to be very scarce this year.
A total of 65 hunting licenses had
been issued at the office of the county
auditor up to this morning. Shotgun
reports in this county were not ex
tremely numerous at the opening of
the season. One of the first hunters
to return this morning was W. G.
Fredericks who succeeded in bagging
a fine mallard duck.
Here are a few things which it
will be( well to remember: No wood
ducks may be hunted a stationary
blind is compulsory according to the
law one may shoot from a boat hid
den in the rushes, but artificial'hides
are not permitted chasing ducks in
VOLUME XL. NO. 38
a boat is forbidden, not of course
barring the retrieving of killed birds
only twenty-five decoys per hunter
will be allowed fifteen ducks is the
limit of one man's h^g the sunrise
and sunset law must be strictly ob
served that is no man must shoot be
fore sunrise or after the setting of
the sun. For the benefit of the hunt
ers on the back of all licenses is
printed an abridged- calendar dealing
with the hours of sunrise and sunset
at this time of the year.
Live Stock Fair.
Next Monday, Tuesday and Wednes
day the Milaca Holstein and Guernsey
Breeders' association will stage its
annual livestock fair at Milaca.
On Tuesday Prof. McGuire of the
university will judge the stock, and
during the afternoon he will deliver
a talk.
Prof. M. E. Chapman of the state
university will visit the fair on
Wednesday and talk on poultry that
evening. State Dairy and Food Com
missioner J. J. Farrell will address
those in attendance Wednesday after
noon.
Special music will feature the fair
and an interesting and instructive
time is assured.
The Mille Lacs county fair will open
next Wednesday, and a carload of
live stock picked from the Milaca
show will be on exhibition.
Council Meets.
The village council met in regular
session last evening, but aside from
acting on the usual grist of bills little
business of importance was transact
ed. Mayor Newbert presided, and all
members were present with the ex
ceptions of Councilmen Smith and
Gottwerth.
The council decided to install an
automatic fire alarm system that will
be connected with the telephone ex
change. Firemen and all village offi
cers will be connected.
The hitching post question was dis
cussed but no action was taken. As
yet the removal of the hitching posts
from Main street has not been or
dered. No other business came up for
consideration, and the council ad
journed in regular form.
Girls of Sixties Entertained.
Mrs. Sophia Soule entertained the
Girls of the Sixties last Thursday
evening, and ten members were pres
ent. It was a farewell party in honor
of Mrs. Imogene Soule, mother of the
hostess, who left on Sunday for Chi
cago to pass the winter with her son,
L. Soule, and family. A tempting din
ner was served, and two piano selec
tions by Mrs. Wilkes were appreciated.
Officers for the ensuing year were
also elected. It was an enjoyable
occasion, and those present pro
nounced Mrs. Soule to be a model
hostess.
Winsor-Krengel.
Mr. Virgil C. Wmsor and Miss Olga
Leona Krengel were united in mar
riage Tuesday noon at the home of the
bride's parents in Mankato. The
groom is a son of Mr. and Mrs. S.
Winsor of this village, and is a young
man of sterling worth. Numerous
friends here wish Mr. Winsor and his
bride a married life of uninterrupted
bliss. Mr. and Mrs. Winsor will reside
at Excelsior.
The Potato Market.
The first carload of potatoes to
leave the Princeton depot this season
was shipped from here Tuesday by
G. H. Gottwerth & Co.
Receipts the past week have been
good for this season, and prices have
been up. As high as $1.22 per bush
el has been paid. This morning the
prices ranged from $1.00 to $1.10.
'Nuflf Said.
Tommy was late at Sunday school
one morning and upon arriving was
asked by the minister why he was

said Tommy.
"Your father is a very' good and
righteous man to do so," said the min
