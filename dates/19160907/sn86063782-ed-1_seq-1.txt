Texas, to juote from a pamphlet, is
"The most progressive city iu the State
of Texas aud the largest city iu the
'Rocky Mountain Southwest' south of
Dearer, west of San Antonio or Fort
Worth aud east of Los Angeles?a city
of beautiful homes aud magnificent
business buildings, and of boundless
business opportunities."
This is the city near which the sol
diers from South Carolina are eucainped,
seven miles out of the mesa, their
camp being over 4,000 feet above the
sea level.
El Paso has a population of 70,000.

modern and thoroughly up-to-date in
every respect of the progressive American
cities with paved streets, tall office
buildings, aud beautiful parks
stands iu contrast to the Mexican city
of Juare, from which it is separated
by the narrow Rio Grande, a typical
Mexican city of the Republic of Mexico,
with the civilization of the sixteenth
century, where language, manners,
mode of dress and style of architecture
are absolutely foreign in the
American conception to those terms of
everyday life.
The settlement of El Paso is described
in this fashion::
That portion of Texas in which El
Paso is located first became known to
the world through the followers of
the Spanish conquiestadores who came
this way after the pacification of the
southern portion of the country by
Cortez. who reached the Ria Grande.
or as it was then called the Rio Bravo
del Norte, in 1540; here they found rich
agriculture colonies of Pueblo Indians
cultivations the valley on what is now
the Mexican side of the river.
The present site of El Paso then,
and for many years after, was barren
incapable of heintr irrigated by waters
taken from the Rio Grande, owing to
its elevation and as matter of fact,
was never settled until 1S27. when an
adventuresome Mexican cattle herder,
uamed Fonce l>e Leon, asked for and
was given a tract of land on the north
bank of the river and built his adobe
ranch house on the site of the present
Mills building, the largest concrete
building, with more floor spacer
In the world. This was in 1S27. nol
1855, or within a few years after the
signing of the treaty of GuadalupeHidalgo,
when all that ]>ortlon of the
country north of the Rio Grande l>e
came American territory. Alwwt 2<K
adventuresome Americans, chiefly en
gaged in hauling merchandise fron
the markets of the East to those or
the Pacific coast, made this station or
the great transcontinental stage an<
freight routes, and in that year ha<
a population of 200, largely made ui
of drivers, horse wranglers, corra
keej>ers and the keepers of eatinf
houses and supply stores.
When It Began to Grow.
El Paso, or Franklin, as it was thei
called, made but little advancemen
i? I,,,inline ivnv until after thi
in lur cnj i/uuv....n %
conclusion of the War Between th<
States. At that time the holders o
the transcontinental railroads seekin;
passes through the Rocky Mountaii
district became attracted to the city o

lowest the Isthmus of Tebauutepec
f and the Artie circle. Gen Fremont,
the great American pathfinder, made
his discovery many years before and
attempted the financing and building
of the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific
Railroad, which would have been the
first railway to the Pacific coast, but
the civil war interfered with the carrying
out of his plans. After the war
the matter was revived and then began
the great race between rival railroad
builders for occupancy of the
building of the Southern Pacific, the
Texas and Pacific and the Sante Fe, all
getting in here about the same time
during the year 1882, then the city began
to grow.
The name El Paso as appplied to
he city was not adopted until 1866.
During that year President 0uarez,
the President of Mexico, who had been,
driven out of the Capital of Mexico
by the French under Maximilian, named
the city of El Paso Del Norte, the
Mexican city opposite Franklin 011
the banks of the Rio Grande, the Capital
of the Republic, and set up his
national palace in the little adobe
town. In honor of the event the
people of El Paso del Norte changed
the name of the town to Juarez and
the Americans living in Franklin
changed the name of their town to
El Paso, believing it to be more expressive
of the natural advantages
which would come through commemorating
the fact that it was located
ln> El Paso (the pass in the mountains.)
' A
Upon the arrival of the railroads
the I^tle town began to thrive
tinued to thrive ever since, until
to-day it is . i.e ?1 'he largest cities
in the Stale of Texas and the largest
city in the district luivirg a radius of
1,500 miles. As a railroad centre it
is the largest 011 the American continent
west of the one hundredth
Meridian.
Figures About the City.
Something of the size 0 fEl Paso,
can be obtained from business figures.
Last year there were 1,541 building
permits issued at a valuation of
$3,612,418. There are 13,704 children of
L-,.ii<w,i tn?o n noo of whom are taught
in the public schols. El Paso this
year completed a new high school at a
cost of $500,000. The Texas school
of Mines, a branch of the University
of Texas, is located here. It has 42
church buildings and is a favored city
of the Roman Catholics, who are
! building a new cathedral which will
be one of the architectural wonders
of the Southwest. The ten banks
have a combined capitul of $2,500,000
:;oo. The bank clearings last year
reached $112,589,783, a gain of 22 i>er
cent over the preceding year. The
jobbing and wholesale busiuess has
j ipiadrupled in the last five years and
the development of the mining district
tributary to El Paso makes ,'t
.lucrative that it continue to grow.
El Paso expects to reap boundless
riiins wheu stable government is restored
to Mexico, as this will be the
1 gateway for the trade which will
pour from the United States into that
country. Scores of Mexican merchants
refugees from their country, have established
business in El Paso and will
i probably make this their permanent
headquarters rather than Vera Cruz
or 'inirpico, after the revolutions are
ui.le.l.
The agricultural possibilities are
, great with the opening up to irriga,
ton of the 20,000 acres of land in the
' valleys of the Rio (Irande, in New
Mexico and Texas under the Elephant
Butte dam. With a never failing supi
nlv of water secured through the

' lands will become fertile through Ir'
rigation. All fruits, except citrus
fruits, may he grown. Cereals veg"

two reasons for this action. The flri

that many American manufacturer

The most notable feature of the val

Mexico and Texas is the great Elc
phant Butte Dam. It is said to be th
biggest structure of its kind eve
undertaken by the United States re

It will form a lake in the canyoi
above it that will submerge 40,00<
acres of land?a lake with 200 miles o
shore line and an average depth o
66 feet. This lake will be, it is stated
the largest artificial body of water oi
the globe. It will contain more thai
twice as much water as can be storei
in the Roosevelt dam and fifty per ceu
more than is stored by the Assousai
dam in Egypt.
This lake will contain 862.200,000,00*
gallons of water?enough to spreai
inore than two feet deep over thi
whole State of Deleware. It will re
claim 183,000 acres of the most fcrtll
land on the face of the earth. Of thi
land 158,000 acres lie within the Unit
ted States in New Mexico and Texa
and 25,000 acres in old Mexico. Plan
are on foot to transform the countr;
surrounding the dam into a grea
pleasure resort.
Making Canals and Dams.
The reclamation bureau is nov
spending $100,000 a month in diggin
canals and building diversion dams i:
the Mesilla and El Paso valleys. Ii
this work more than 2,000 men ar
(engaged. There is already built on
big diversion dam, of concrete cor
struction, at Leasburg, at the uppe
end of the Mesilla valley, and anothe
at El Paso. The bureau is utilizin
the channel of the river as the mail
canal of the system, building thes
diversion dams across It at Interval
and tapping it with canals just abov
the dam.
The Mesilla valley ends just abov
El Paso. There the means again draN

city of El Paso. Three miles below E
Paso the mesas recede and the $1 Pas
valley widens out. 4.1,000 acres on th
American side ami 25,000 on the Mex
lean side.
With the delightful climate and th
dry atmosphere this is a great healt
country. And crops of many kind
grow in the irrigated sections. A
'falfa is one of the most abundan

El Paso alone from the dam.
This is a wonderful country an
much more delightful and prosperoi

DOMING CROP OF COTTON
UNDER TWELVE MILLION
farther Deterioration in Growing
Plant Has Brought Estimated
Condition Down to 61.2 and
Predicted Yield to 11,800,000
Bales.
Washington, Aug. 31.?Further deerioration
of the growing cotton crop
luring August has reduced the estlnated
final production by 1,116,000

That forecast of production was made
oday by the department of agricuure,
basing its calculations on the
;ondition of the crop on August 25.
The condition of the crop on August
15 was 61.2 per cent, of a normal com- ^
>ared with 72.3 last month, 69.2 last
rear and 72.5 the average for the last
en years on August 25.
The crop of 11,800,000 bales comlares
with 12,916,000 bales forecast
rom July 25 condition reports and
4,266,000 bales forecast from conlitions
existing June 25. Last year's
roduction was 11,191,820 bales, two
ears ago 16,134,930, three years ago
4,156,486, and four years ago 13,703,21.
During July heavy storms caused
lamage to the crop causing a loss in
iroduction calculated at 1,350,000
ales.
In a statement summarizing condiions
the department said: "August
ras unfavorable for cotton in almost
11 sections of the cotton belt. In the
restern section, the crop deteriorated
everely in Oklahoma and Texas beause
of extreme drought over large
reas which caused the plart to stop
ruitlng and shed. Weevils damaged
he crop considerably in eastern and
outhern Texas, southern Araansas,
western Florida and southwestern
[ppi, Alabama and portions of Louisieorgia
and disastrously in Missisma.
Much of the crop in southern Misissippl
and Alabama, because of rain
nd weevil damage, will require from y
0 to 20 acres of land to produce a
ale of cotton. In the Carolinas and /
orgia hot sunshine following the /
uly rain on the sappy plant caused
"Lack of fertilizer which was leachil
from the soil by ji'ly rains, or with
irawn by grass and weeds; -was SbowA >
y the appearance of the plant, which ^^^91
eems to have reached maturity with *
, small stalk and a lack of fruit. ^
'here are mank grassy fields in the
astern states. Caterpillars are reported
in Texas, Louisiana, Florida
nd fieorgia, but have (lone no mateial
damage as yet.
"Picking is general over the southrn
half of the belt, and even in Oklaoma,
where there is much premature
penlng. Virginia, Tennessee, northrest
Mississippi, eastern Arkansas
nd Missouri have good to splendid
pops of cotton."
