Opposition to Corrupt Prac

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept 6. While the
Senate was waiting today on the
revenue bill conferees, the Owen cor
rupt practices bill was taken up in
the Senate. Democrats and Republi
cans indulged in personal exchanges
and regaled their fellow senators with
accounts of campaign contributions
and the rewards given some contri
butors in the past.
The vote to take up the bill was 32
to 14, nine Republicans voting with
the majority, to consider the measure
and seven
Kn-ocrats voting aga.nst i
it. Senator Owen, its author, tonight
cancelled a speaking engagement be
ta re the Ohio Democratic convention
to remain here and fight for its adop
tion. It probably will be taken up
again before noon tomorrow and the
Oklahoma senator intends to keep it
before the Senate until a vote is se
cured, 'jr what is more probable, ad
journment is forced by the leaders.
Senator Curtis of Kansas, Republican,
and Ashurst of Arizona, Democrat,
furnished the excitement of the day s
debate in an interchange which looked
for a few minutes as if it might
suit in a personal encounter. .
To Cut Campaign Funds.
The bill would restrict campaign
funds and to a greater extent than
the existing law. Senator Curtis
argued that such : aieasure passed
when a campaign is half over might
work unfairly against men who have
already spent the stipulated ain'junL 1
He advocated a more stringent law
than that proposed and one that
would particularly restrict the use of
congressional frsnks to prevent sen
ators or representatives from sending
out campaign circulars at government
expense.
Ashurst Flays Kansan.
"If the senator charges that this is
a violation of the law," said Senator
Ashurst, when he g'.it the floor, " he
has something to learn."
Shakes Hit Fist
He explained that his letter had
been submitted and approved by the
postmaster general 'and the matter
waj one which could be passed on a
frank. Calling Senator Curtis the
"Pharise? from Kansas," he strode
back across the center aisle and
shook his finger under Senator Curtis'
nose. Senator Smoot, seated just be
tween the two, moved back in n.'.ick
alarm as Senator Ashurst approached
Senator Curtis smilid but kept his
Feat.
Says "If Penrose Lies.
A little later. Mr. Ashurst turned on
Senator Penrose, who said he had
noticed a "copper lobby," around the
capitol whose members had been talk
ing with the Arizona senator.
"If," said Mr. Ashurst, " the senator
means to say that my jte has been
influenced by a copper lobby or any
other lobby, he licR."
Several senators objected to this
language and Senator Ashurst ex
plained he had said "if," and agreed
to withdraw his remark.
Several senators told of large con
tributions to campaigns in various
states.
Two amendments to the bill were
pi'jposed. One by Senator Brady, to
postpone the effective date of the act
until January, 1917, two months after
election, was approved. The other of
fered by Senator Jones to make it a
felony for any manufacturer of in
toxicating liquor to contribute to a
campaign fund, was nt acted upon.

California, by Fixing Damage
of Severing It from System,
Establishes Precedent in the
United States.
(By Review Leased Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6. The
California Railroad Commission fixed
""""'"I1 "l
electric distributing system of the
Southern California Kdison Company
in Los Angeles in connection with its
intended purchase by the city of Ios
Angeles.
The company contended the proper
ty, plus severance damages, was
worth $21,89U,0G6 while the municipal
set up on it a value of $3,432,S03.
The decision is the first of its kind
rendered in the United States by a
public service commission and sets a
precedent In regard to fixation of sev-
j eranee damage that is, the damage
re-:sufferpd by II1Pmbers of the system by
an excision of the 1am Angeles por
tion. The opinion lixed the actual value
of the system at $4,740,000, allowing
in addition severance damages of
$1,578.00".
The decision stated that reproduc
tion costs rather than the capitaliza
tion of earnings was the basis taken,
and that the commission worked with
a clear understanding of the necessi
ty of an award, which by its fairness,
would encourage further investments
of capital in the state.
Financial interests all over the
country have been watching for the
decision.

Retaliation Measure Against

WASHINGTON. Sept. 6. Elimina
tion of all stamp taxes in the emerg
ency reveaue bill, seriously objected
to by the House, was agreed upon late
tonight by the conference committee,
getting in exchange for this conces
sion their demand for restoration of
a tax on refiners of copper.
To make up a loss of about $7,000,
000 revenue in sacrificing the stamps
taxes the conferees are expected to
agree to a suggestion of House mem
bers that the profit tax on manufac
turers of munitions of war be in
creased from 10 to 124 per cent.
Sacrifice or tlie proposed stamp
taxes puts the revenue bill back in
accord with the orginal decision of
the administration leaders to repeal
all provisions of the existing war rev
enue law which were generally regard
ed as annoyances by the public.
The proposed stamp taxes, now
eliminated, included bonds, debent
ures and certificates of stocks, ware
house and custom house certificates,
foreign steamship ticket and Pullman
car tickets. At midnight the confer
ence declared that working out of the
details of the report could not be con
cluded until some time tomorrow.
The proposed license tax on cor
poration stock, increases in the In
come and the inheritance tax, and the
provisions creating a tariff commis
sion all were approved. Continuing
appropriation of $::00.0i0 a year for
the tariff commission, was said to
have been stricken out. The confer
ence also was reported to have under
consideration changes in the proposed
taxes on wine.
WASHINGTON. Sept. fi. Plans of
administration leaders to adjourn con

ed tonight when the conference com
mittee on the emergency bill indicat
ed that it could not reach an agree
ment until some time tomorrow at
the earliest. The report may not be
ready before Friday, therefore delay
ing adjournment until Saturday.
Put the revenue bill is not all that
is delaying adjournment. In the sen
ate, a filibuster has developed against
the passage of the corrupt practices
act. and various senators are clamor
ing for consideration of minor bills.
The general dcfii iency bill is held up
in conference until a report on the
revenue bill is reached.
Senator Kern, the majority leader,
said he did not look for adjournment
before Saturday. After an all day dis

ees had not completed discussion of
amendments, when they adjourned

Union Men of Subway and
Elevated Lines Walk Out,
Leaving City in Worst Pre
dicament in Years.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Sept. 6 A strike was
declared early tonight by unionized
employes of the subway and elevated
railroad lines operated by the Inter
boro Rapid Transit Company. Union
officials asserted that New York elec
tric train facilities would be com
pletely paralyzed by morning. Motor
men and conductors on the surface
lines may strike through sympathy.
Should the strikers succeed in their
purpose. New York will face the
worst tie up in its history. Thus far
the union has confined its demands IV
the Interboro and its subsidiary sur
face car lines, the New York Railways
Company. Employes on the "Green
Car" line of the New York Railways
Company also voted to strike.
This is one of the most important
of the city's surface car lines.
Oscar S. Straus, chirman of the pub
lic service commission, requested that
the strike be held up pending an at
tempt by himself and Mayor Mitchell
to settle the trouble. The labor lead
ers declined.
Union leaders declare many work
men were discharged today because
they refused to take off their union
badges. Interboro car barns gave the
appearance of barracks. Approximate
ly 30,000 men have been housed and
fed in preparation for the anticipated
strike order. Most of the men were
hired by strike breaking agencies at
the time '.if the railroad emergency
and were taken over by the Interboro.
Subpoenaes were served on officers
of the Interboro Company by the
public service commission, which ti
morrow will begin an investigation of
the cause that precipitated the strik.
Subpoenaes also were issued for
William II. Fitzgerald and William
('mway,, representing the union.
Trains were running as usual long
past midnight on subway and elevated
lines, despite reports at union head
quarters that many men had quit.
Union leaders declared their men had
been replaced by strike breakers.
