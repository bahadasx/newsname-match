To iIIhciihs three questions of vital
Importance to Klamath county, the
dliTctorH mid offlcera of Klamath

One question is the appointing of
a committee to go to San Francisco
und interview President William
Spioulu of the Southern I'acillc about
construction of tho Modoc Northern
from Klamath Falls to tho California
linn.
The second Is the question of send
ing the local committee to Salem on
September 11th, to Interview tho
Htuto highway commission on the pro
posed unto und wagon road from
Klamath Falls to Florence.
The third is the question of em
Ploying C. It. Miller to tnko u series
of photographic views of tho route of
the Strahorn railroad and of the ter
ritory to bo tapped by tho road.
It Is believed (lint at the meeting
this aftoinoon, Captain J. W. Siemens
president of Klamath Commercial
Club, will appoint three citizens of
Klamath county to make tho trip toJ
San Francisco. Quick action Is being
tnken now, bocuuso It Is bolloved tho
time Is rlpo to urgo construction of
the Modoc Northern south from
Klumnth Falls. Tills vlow Is taken
bocuuso Chior Engineer Hood of tho
Southern I'nclllc has expressed hlm
Bcir favorably on the move to begin

eral high officials of the Southern Pa
cillc hnvo visited Klamath during the
Inst few weeks, evidently with the
Idea of gathering information on the
tralllc possibilities of ther country be

railroad movement.

meet September 11th, and would be
ready to hear tho Klamath delega
tion. The purpose of going to Salem
Is to let the commission know that
Klamath is behind Kugono in the
movement for a good commercial road
Irom Klamath Kills to Eugene, to
Florence, on the coast. It is tho plan
ot Klamath mid Eugene to have this
woik done with money appropriated

At the meeting this afternoon tho

Culling President Wilson's hurrying
through congress of the Adameon bill
"a burrender to force," Charles R.
Hughes today criticized the demo
cratic administration. He declared
the blirwas "only one step to abdica
tion of government."
"The Adamson bill is nut an eight
hour law, but is a -wage law. Tt is a
surrender of the rule of reason," said
Mr. Hughes. He stated that congress
should retard such action. Continu
ing his criticism, be said:
"The American people have won
the right for free discussion, a free
press, a democratic form of govern
ment, free legislative assemblies and
popular selection of executives. We
have left autocracy, tyranny, force.

N.'ucen Sent Out by Government,
While Not Committing Uncle Sam,
Indicate Probable Opening for En
try of Thousands of Acres of Land
as Fertile as Any One Could Ever
Ask For. J
The opening to settlers probably
next spring of a large area of land
around Tulo Lake Is Indicated In
notices being sent out by the recla
mation service to persons now leas
ing these lands. The notices state
that the government may terminate
the leases any time between Novem
ber 1, 1916, and 'March 1, 1917.
When the land-' was leased a stlpula-tiori'eCTlrhgCto.-thergovernment
the
right to do this was included in tho
leases.
Project Manager J. G. Camp said
this morning that the government
was not committing Itself, and that
he could give no assurance that the
land would be thrown open for home
stead entry next year. "
"The notices are being sent to the
lessees that they may know their
leases might be cancelled," said Man
ager Camp. "Hence any fall plow
ing done by the persons leasing this
land this fall will be done at their
own risk."
It is well known that the govern
ment long has contemplated the
throwing open of thousands of acres
of rich land reclaimed by the reces
sion of the waters ot Tule Lake. The
government Is now leasing
acres of this fertile land, and
d has
about 2,000 more acres already re
claimed. When the reclamation of
tho bed ot Tule Lake Is completed,
approximately 30,000 acres will bo
available for cultivation.
While no information is forthcom
ing as regards the amount ot land
that will be opened for entry, or the
dnto of opening, yet people here are
Inclined to bellevo that 1917 will see
hundreds of homesteaders on the
level and productive land that a few
years ago was covered with tho wa
ters of Tulo Lake.
Not only is the land uncovered by
the work of tho reclamation service
valuable as conditions are now, but
It will enhance In value when the
proposed beet sugar factory la estab
lished In that section and the Modoo
Northern railroad Is constructed,
both of which aro generally believed
to bo developments of the near fu
ture. PheUiu Amendment Out
