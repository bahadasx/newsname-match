K until officials have had time to study

ft about 12,000 words.

ft Carranza Trying to Impress People.
I Officials expressed belief that the
I , harsh terms of General Carranza's
f communication were Intended primar
ily to Influence public opinion in his
W& own country.
1-' . Steps were taken by the war de-
mm partment today to obtain more defin-

mm Carranza troops in Chihuahua. Jt wa3
H said that the tone of Carranza's note
EV prompted the action of military offi-
ftft cials without regard lo-thediplomatic
nf phases of the situation.
"a Funston Asked to Outline Situation.
ft General Funston has been asked to
ftft outline clearly the situation in Chlhua.
M hua according to his most recent in-
WM formation of the whereabouts of Car-
ftft ranza detachments. No anxiety is
WW felt for the safety of General Persh-
Hft ing's columns, but, in view of the
Eft statements in General Carranza's note
mm it is desired to know as accurately
KJr as possible what the movements of
ft his forces are.
Kb It was explained at the war depart-
X ment that the real mission of the ex-
K pedition at this time was to prevent
Wat attneks upon the wide sections of the
ma border controlled by its position in
m Mexico. A large border garrison or
Si patrol, it was pointed out, might repel
ftg an attack but could not make it Im-
SM possible.
H l Cavalry Patrols Active.
ft Cavalry patrols are active through
ft , the territory on both sides of General
ft - Pershing's base and his line of com-
H i munications and war department of-
ft ficials hold that a condition of com-
ft t plete security is being maintained in
ft ' this region and along the border, de-
' spite the allegations of the Carranza
ft k not that the expedition is "interned in
ft Chihuahua state," lying idle and with
ft no military object,
ft , No additional troop movements
ft were in contemplation today so far
I: '' as known.
ft . Situation Not Urgent,
ft ' There was no indication at the state
ft ; department that the developments had
ftt produced an urgent situation. A reply
Kt may not be made for a week or ten
mi days. Various inaccurate statements
ftl it makes will be pointed out. Rofcr
ftt enccs to the effect of America dom
K estic politics upon tiie border sltua
Bg tion, the suggestion that all Latin
H America is waiting to see what the
ft United States will do to maintain its

K nitlons with Europe probably will be
wholly ignored, although it is under
iftA' stood they would have brought a
1 Bharp rebuke it any less perplexed
mt and disordered government had tak
ft en such a course.
K Troops Will Remain.

the American camp nearest Casas

General Gavira proceeded to -Pearson,
where he spent last night, while
the American commander went to
Dublan. General Pershing declined
to make any comment on the proposed

Mexican Captain Suggests Place.
No place for the meeting had been

Pershing received a Carranzista cap
tain, who called to inform him of Gen

station at Nuevo Casas Grandes as
the place for the meeting.
General Pershing made the trip

mander of northern Chihuahua who
went to Casas Grandes yesterday to
confer with General J. J. Pershing,
the American expeditionary-commander,
is expected to return to Juarez
tonight(Jr early tomorrow. This an
nouncement was made in Juarez to
day by General Francisco Gonzales
upon receipt of a message from Gen
eral Gavira.
This announcement that the confer
ence was to be of so short duration,
came as somewhat of a surprise as
persons in close touch with the situ

ed that he expected to confer with
General Pershing this afternoon at
Colonia Dublan, the American field

Carranza Note Surprising.
At military headquarters ou the
Mexican side the new Carranza note
was read with apparent surprise, Gen

of the note came with Its publica

Gavira departed yesterday for Casas

WATTE TO DIE IN
ELECTRIC CHAIR
New Trial of Multiple Murder
er Denied and Sentence
Is Pronounced.
MAKES SHORT SPEECH
Expresses Sorrow for Crimes
and Hopes Penalty Will
Partly Compensate
for Deaths.
New York, June 1. Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite today was sentenced
to die in the" electric chair during the
week of July 10 the penalty for the
murder of his father-in-law, John E.
Peck, of which he was convicted.
When Dr Waite was presented to
the bar his counsel moved that he
be granted a new trial. This was de
nied by the court and sentence was
then imposed.
When Justice Shearn concluded the
sentence, Waite delivered a short
speech In which he expressed appre
ciation of the manner in which his
trial was conducted and his thanks to
the court, the prosecutors and to his
own attorney.
I Dr Waite said he was sorry for his
crimes and for the suffering and trou
ble he had caused others He de
clared that he hoped that by surren
dering his body for punishment he
would compensate in some small de
gree for the deaths of his victims.
Waite entered the court room, head
erect, step firm and apparently cool.
He addressed the court with suave
politeness. His voice wavered as he
spoke of his sorrow for his crimes
"I thank the court" he said to Jus
tice Shearn, "for the very fair and
impartial manner in which It has treat
ed men. 1 also thank the jurors for
the courteous manner in which they
listened to me. I feel their judgment
was justifietl.' """"" ' " ",Jfc ""
Waite Thanks Attorneys.
"My sincere thanks are due to the
prosecuting attorney, Mr. Brothers,
who was always nice to me. Mr.
Deuel, my counsel, is aso entitled to
my thanks. He believed implicitly I
was not guilty.
"I ask for forgiveness. I am very
very glad to give my body In expia
tion for the things I have done and I
give my soul freely to rectify my mis
deeds I hope It will go on and on
forever to purge itself."
Waite was taken back to the Tombs
where preparations were made to re
moe him at once-to Sing Sing.
Within half an hour after sentence
was Imposed, Waite was on board a
train for the state prison.
When he was searched before go
ing to the court room this morning, a
small pocket mirror, broken in two
pieces, was found in his pocket. The
pieces of glass were taken from him.

ment In the trial, which was continued
today, of six men charged with mis
use of the mails In connection witn
California and Oregon land frauds,
held the jury in the United States
district court spellbound when he ex
plained with picturesque detail how
lie and a score of fellow conspirat
ors had collected nearly $1 .000,000 by
misrepresentation, from men and wo
men in all parts of the United States.
After serving sixteen months in the
federal penitentiary at McNeils Island,
Washington, for his share in tho con
spiracy, Logan made a full confession
and was given a pardon to permit him
to testify against the present defend
ants. The Oregon Development company,
through which the conspirators did
most of their work, was described by
Logan as having neither officers nor
assets. He told of deceiving victims
by means of "dressed up" conspirat
ors, many of whom, he said, he edu
cated himself.
Innocent Boosters Employed.
Elaborately fitted offices in Chi
cago, Seattle, Tacoma and other cit
ies, said Logan, formed part of his
working plant. Innocent "boosters"
wero made, ho said, of reputable citi
zens who did not know the game was
crooked.
Logan secured many victims in Los
Angeles, he said, by delivering a
course of lectnies on, "An easy way to.

his eloquence that the brother-in-law
of a fellow conspirator wanted to pay
?100 on his application after hearing
Logan's lecture. Professional honor,
he said, restrained him from robbing
the relative of a partner.

The .momentous "battle at Verdun
shows no signs of slackening in vio
lence, but the latest official reports,
in contrast with most of those issued
during the last few days, record no
further advances for the Germans.
Dead Man's Hill, or its Immediate
vicinity, has been the scene of the
latest infantry engagements. The
Germans attacked the French posi
tions here last night, but were com
pletely repulsed, according to this af
ternoon's Paris bulletin.
Current bulletins on the campaign
In the southern Tyrol record continu
ed gains for the Austrians, but there
as yet has been no breach In the main
line of the Italian defense which bars
the way to the Venetian plain.
Paris, June 1,11:50 a. m. The Ger
mans were completely repulsed in an
attack delivered upon the French po
sitions at Dead Man's Hill about 8
o'clock last night, according to an of
ficial statement issued by the EYench
war office today. A violent bombard
ment continued in this region
throughout the night. An intense ar
tillery duel is in progress on the cast
and west fronts at Douaumont,
Tho text of the statement says:
"On (he left bank of the Meuse the
bombardment continued with great
violence last night in all the terri
tory around Dead Man's Hill. A de
termined German attack delivered
yesterday evening at S o'clock upon
the eastern slopes of the hill was
completely repulsed.
"On the right bank of the river,
the artillery fighting has become ex
ceedingly intense west and east of
Fort Douaumont.
"Duririg the night of May 31 June
1, a French air squadron threw down
twenty shells on the railroad stations
of Thionville. Audun and Le Roman
and fifty other shells upon the com
missary headquarters of "the enemy at
Azeannes."
Costly Check For Germans.
Paris, June 1, 9:45 a. m. More com
plete accounts reaching here from
Verdun show that the battle which
raged from May 27 to May 30 and
which ended, according to a statement
of the Frencli war office, in a costly
check for the Germans, was the great
est effort made by the Teutonic forces
in the whole Verdun operations. More
and heavier guns and denser masses
of troops were assembled along the
three miles of the French front from
Hill No. 304 to the Meuse than in any
previous attack.
The French stood firm under an
avalanche of shot and shell and drove
back wave after wave of a flood of
Teutonic infantry They surrenderd
only about 100 yards of ground at
Little Caurettes wood, where a trench
had been obliterated by the terrific
fire of the Germans big guns.
According to Information given by
prisoners, the German forces consist
ed of two fresh brigades with three
companies of pioneers. In the opinion
of French military critics the result
was not only a costly failure for the
Germans but a success for the French
such as they have rarely attained
French Recover Lost Ground.
The Germans suffered so heavily
that they ceased further attacks while
the French by a prompt counter-attack
re-established themselves again
south of Cumieres and won an import
ant point of vantage on the south
western slope of Dead Mans"Hlll.
It develops that during yesterday's
battle west of the Meuse the Germans
sent' back the French line between
Dead Man's Hill and Cumieres for a
distance of three-quarters of a mile.
The French battalions, however, which
had retired before the unprecedented
artillery fire, re-formed ana made a
desperate counter attack supported
bv reinforcements. After nearly two
hours of violent fighting they recover
ed all the lost ground. The infantry
fighting In this struggle is described
as the fiercest of the war.

Berlin, May 31, via London. June 1, ,
12:30 p. m Professor Hans Del i
Brueck of the University of Berlin
has written an article In regard to
American mediation in the war, in
which he says there is something re
pellant to Germany in the Idea of
accepting President Wilson as medi

sympathies of the president are with
the entente powers, which might be
regarded as disqualifying him so far ,
as the central powers are concerned. ;
He continues:
Wilson's Speeches Insulting.
"Moreover President Wilson, by us
