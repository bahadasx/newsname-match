GERVR, SATISFIED
PEACE IS IN SIGIT
Says Settlemement of Differ
ences Between Washing
ton and Berlin Pre
pares Way.
Berlin, May 26.-(Via London, L
May 27.---United States Ambas-; S
sador James W. Gerard is con- I
vinced that peace is in sight, ac- p
cording to an interview publish- T
ed in a Munich newspaper from C
its Berlin correspondent. Mr. E
Gerard is quoted as saying: S
"Nothing can shake my con- i a
fidence that peace is on its way." .1
The ambassador referred to n
the settlement of the differences. i
of the United States and Germ-1 p
any as 'preparing the- way for p
President Wilson to take up the t(
question of peace. "President 'II
Wilson," said he. "has muel?ti
greater freedom of action now to d<
deal with the immense world h
problem, which will determing B
the future atttiude of nearly all ti
the countries of the globe. p:
"It is useless t6 discuss at this h:
moment the question as to w
whether President Wilson's in- tc
termediation is desirable or proba- rc
ble. In this instance facts alone rr
must speak, and one of the most 0(
important facts is that the neu- cc
trals are probably as much inter- f
ested in bringing about an early'ec
peace as the belligerents. Amer- C(
ica urgently needs peace and for ai
this reason alone the American;
Government is under an obliga- N
tion to its citizens to do and sup- F
port everything that serves the G
cause of peace. A fact o C chief G
importance is that' my Govern- D
ment is really willing to take 01
action for the promotion of peace.

Referring 'to the recent crisis a
in German-American relations, s
the ambassador said:
"I hardly know from wvhat ti
uarter the present good rela- I5

and Germany could be distur bed. T
The establishment of good rela- it

most important factors of the 01
