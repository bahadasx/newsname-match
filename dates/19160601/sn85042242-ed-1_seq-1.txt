Was Bitten While Spending Va
I cation in Western
I Mountains.
DISEASE DID NOT DEVEL­
OP UNTIL YESTERDAY
Young Man Worked in Father's
Store Until Noon Decoration
Day.
Robert Gussner, son of George
Gussner,. pioneer merchant, died at
the Bismarck hospital last evening,
from blood poisoning and fever, due
to the bite of a Montana wood tick.
He returned to Bismarck from the
west Monday evening. Hopes of his
recovery were soon abandoned, as the
spotted fever following infection from
such bites is in most cases fatal. He
did not become seriously ill until yes­
terday morning.
Following a trip to see his mother
at Bonners Ferry, Idaho, Robert Guss­
ner stopped off for a few days' recre­
ation in the mountains. When he was
bitten, he removed his clothing and
made a thorough examination in
hoiies of locating the bite. He was
unable to do so. In a few hours he
became ill and hurried home. Yes­
terday his body was badly broken out
and he had all the symptoms of,spot­
ted fever. He worked in the store
until noon Decoration Day.
Several physicians were called in
consultation, but hope of his recovery
was soon despaired of.

Arthur Gussner is expected on ..Vol
from Chicago this evening. 'Mr.
George Gussner and Miss C. Gunert
were at his bedside.
The news came as a distinct shock
to Robert's many friends in Bismarck.
iHe was in good health when he left
and was. on the tast lap of a happy
vacation when he was bitten by the
tick.
it is not definitely known where
lie got the bile. He spent most ol
liis time in the woods about Bon­
ner's Ferry. Then he went to British
Columbia, where he spent several
days in the mountains. On his way
home he stopped off in Montana. It
Is said he must, have been bitten
about 14 days ago.. He was rational
until 7 o'clock last evening and short­
ly before 11:00 he died. He thought
he h:id the grip and suffered intense
pains in his feet.
He is survived by his parents and
his brother, Arthur.
The funeral will take place at the
Presbyterian church Friday after
nopn, at 2:00. Rev. Meyers will offi­
ciate.
The store will be closed until Satur­
day morning:
Robert Gussner was born in Bis­
marck, 27 years Ago, and assisted his
father in the firm of Gussner & Sons.
He was one of the bright young busi­
ness men of the city and had a large
circle of friends.
Dr. R, H. Treacy, head of the fed­
eral bureau of animal husbandry,
here, has made a study of the tick
and Dr. Giltner of the local bureau
has at times been detailed fronv^d*"
Bismarck office to assist in investi­
gating the deadly insect.
The bite' causes the spotted fever.
It was only a few years ago that this,
disease in the west was traced to the
tick. It is fetal in about 80 per cent
of the cases.
Some cases of the tick bite last
year were reported about Miles City.
The tick is most numerous in the
Hamilton district and near Missoula,
and is confined almost entirely to
mountainous country.

Wilson Not
Acceptable
as Mediator
Berlin, May .'50—At. the session of
the Reichstag today, Dr. Gustav
Strosemann, National Liberal, in an
address, rejected" the idea that Presi­
dent Wilson would be available as a
peace mediator.
"If you take a vote of the German
people," said Dr. Strosemann, "only
a small minority would accept Pres­
ident Wilson as a mediator, after ho
has rendered it possible for our ene­
mies to keep going in a military way
by intensifying the possibility for the
manufacture of munitions, after he has
doing nothing whatever to utilize the
vast power of a great world state to
guarantee the shipment of provisions
to Germany, after we have found thas
he has ever raised his hands threat­
eningly and proceeded asrainst us
with all his power when we tried 1o
defend ourselves against) the miser­
able starving-out war.
"We would not reject peace
mediation of. a really, neutral power,
possibly the President of S itzer
land, but President Wilson we reject,
and we believe the most of the Ger­
man people approve the rejection of
it."
DECORATION DAY
FATAL TO
Fergus Falls Man Dies as Result
of Burns When Balloon
Catches Fire.
WHILE ON VACATION
William Siewert, 23 years of age,
of Fergus Falls (lied at. the Bismarck
hospital at 9:30 last evening as the
result of burns received at
Hazen the afternoon of Decoration
Day. Mr. Sipwert was assisting his
brother-in-law, Charles W. Hardin, in
preparing for a balloon ascension,
while the big gas bale was suddenly
ignited.
According to advices received here
Mr. Sicwert was inside the balloon
stretching out the folds and preparing
it for the reception of the hot. air,
when a sudden winsiorm caught the
great bag and threw it towards the
tlames. tt caught fire immediately.
An effort to rescue Siewert from
his perilous position inside the big
bag only served to enwrap him more
closely in its folds. He finally man­
aged to make his way to the outer air.
His clothes were a mass of flames
and bystanders threw coats over him
to smother them. Only the fact that
Mr Siewert wore a gas muzzle over
his fact gave him even a fighting
chance.
Siewert is a brother of Mrs. Chas.
Hardin and having his vacation from
his work this week, came to Hazen
to aid Charles Hardin in the balloon
ascension just for the trip.
"Mrs. Siewert arrived yesterday af­
ternoon from Fergus Falls and was
with her husband at the time of his
death. Other relatives are in the
city and arrangements are being made
to care for the body.
It is expected that the body will
be taken to Fergus Falls for burial
hut no definite arrangements have
been made to date.

Louis Warren Hill today may well
be called the prince regent of the
empire of the northwest!
For the railroad crown of the great
territory which his dead father, the
famous "J. J.," opened up, has been
handed down to his son, Louis.
When J. J. Hill died, May 29, Louis
was president of the Great Northern
and chairman of the board of direct­
ors of the Northwestern Trust com­
pany, bis father's two most valuable
properties.
He has been called the most un­
usual railroad president in America.
If fate had not given him a railroad
building father, Louis Hill would
probably have been an artist. His
pictures have been praised by some
of the best critics in America.
Yet upon analysis there seems t6
lie nothing very strange- in the fact
that "Jim" Hill's son should possess
enough imagination to paint good pic­
tures.

London, May til.—French troops

that came to the northwest. It was
imagination that spurred him on in
the enormous projects for which he
became known around the world.
It is imagination that has made
Louis Hill one of the best publicity
getters that any railroad ever had.
His father opened up the north­
west, but the son "put it on the map"
by making its opportunities known
through the newspapers and maga­
zines of the world.
Besides painting, Hill plays the vio­
lin. runs his own autos, studies native
Indian dialects and is the best after
dinner speaker in Minnesota.
Of all his many hobbies his most
ambitious is the development of a
tract of 800,000 acres in central Ore­
gon, which he owns, with other capi
talists.
After traveling all over the coun
try he has decided that this huge re­
serve can be made the garden spot of
America.

Mexicans
Conserving
Amunition
Douglas, Arizona, May 31—Receipt
of the reports of the Carranza note
urging thai American troops be with­
drawn from Mexico, coupled with sud
don activity in the shipment of muni­
tions from Auua Prieta to Fronleras
and Chichuta, the base cam'ps of the
de facto troops In Northern Sonora,
caused some local uneasiness today.
While it was admitted in Agua
Prieta that, such shipments are be­
ing made, it was stated that they were
no larger than other previous ship­
ments and had no special signifi­
cance. While the embargo on arms
and ammunition continues in force, it
Is reliably reported that the Mexican
forces are using as little ammuni­
tion as possible and have a reserve o:
several millions ot' rounds.
NOTE FOR HOME
NOT EPECTED TO
TAKE WORDS SERIOUSLY
Washington, May 81.—General .Car
ranza's latest note, bluntly question­
ing the good faith of the United
StoUta £ov.ertuQent, »nd- yith a threat
of armed resistance clemanding- with­
drawal of American troops from Mex­
ico, was presented at the state de­
partment today by Elisio Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador-designate.
Tonight a translation of the volum­
inous document, about 12,000 words
long, was laid before President Wil­
son, who at once considered how it
should be answered.
Not Taken Seriously.
iNo one in official circles would at­
tempt to forecast just what course
the president would decide upon.
There was complete unanimity, how­
ever, in the belief that there would
be no immediate withdrawal of the
Pershing expedition. High officials
said that Mexican officials so far had
utterly failed to show their ability to
protect the border from bandits. It.
was suggested that the belligerent
and uncompromising tone assumed by
Carranza. probably was largely for
effect, upon the Mexican public, and
there Vas little disposition to be­
lieve the de facto government actu­
ally contemplated an effort to expel
the American army by force.
Not an Ultimatum.
Mr. Arredondo left the impression
that his chief did not expect the de­
fiant words of the note to be taken
at their face value, when on handing
the communication to Acting Secre­
tary Polk, he gave notice that it. was
not intended as an ultimatum, but as
a continuation of the negotiations,
which have been progress between
the two governments.
The new note, written before the
withdrawal of the Langhorne-Sibley
expedition, which entered Mexico af­
ter the Boquilles raid, was brought to
Washington Monday by Manuel Men.
dez, an attache of the Mexican for­
eign office, word of its coming had
been received last week, but on Man
dez's arrival insisted that he knew
nothing of a note, and merely was in
the United States on a vacation. Ad
redondo said last night that he had
heard nothing of a note.
Today it was explained that Man
dez left Mexico City with instruc­
tions to keep the purpose of his visit
secret even from the enibass" here
until he had communicated with the
foreign office upon reaching Washing­
ton. His orders to give the communi­
cation to the ambassador-designate
for presentation to the state depart­
ment, it was said, did not arrive until
abou midnight last night.
A CORRECTION.
It was erroneously announced in
yesterday's Tribune that the railroad
commissioners had ordered a siding
installed at Parsliall. The commis
sioners have not granted that this sid­
ing be installed, but are considering
the matter at the present time.
SHUGRUE'S EYES DIM

New fork, May 3i.—Failing eyesight
has ended the career of Shusrue
of Jersey City, just at a time when
the youthful lightweight ranked among
the topnotchers. Shugrue always was
a good attraction. A year ago a cata­
ract appeared in one of his eyes. For
a time he fought despite this handi­
cap. The affliction became worse.
Both eyes became affected. An oper­
ation failed to help and Shugrue has
laid awity his gloves tor all time.

INSOLENT NOTE
IS SENT Bt
Declares This Nation Has Violate
ed Mexico's Sovereignty by,
Crossing Border.
INSISTS THAT SOLDIER8
WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY
Administration Asked to Outlini
Its Policy Toward the
Mexicans.
Mexico City, May 31—Claiming that
the words and protests of the United
States have been entirly in contradic­
tion of thir acts, and that in spite
of protests not to intervene in the
affairs of Mexico, soldiers of the Unit­
ed States are in Mexico without the
consent of the Mettcan governrment
and in violation of Mexico's sovereign­
ty, the Mexican government now asks
for the withdrawal immediately of
those troops. The request is made In
a 12,000 word note made public at the
Foreign Office at noon.
No Authority ,j/
The note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after ttie
Columbus incident without the permit,
sion of the Mexican government.'TMb
act was not considered one.of inva­
sion, because the United States'hatt
had misinterpreted the attitude
of the Mexican government. Wh»n a
second expedition crossed the line'af
tr the Glenn Springs raid, snA. their
claim that this was done with the con­
sent of "the Mexican "cbfiSur ^it^
Rio, Texas, was untenable and that
act can- only be considered one "of in­
vasion.
Immediate Withdrawal
"The Mexican government there­
fore invites the United States to bring
to an nd this unsupportable situation,"
the note concludes, "and to support
'•t?
protestations and declarations of
friendship by immediate withdrawal
of American troops."
The note, which is addressed to
Secretary Lansing, reads in part as
follows:
"The Mexican government has Just
received advices that a grotip of Am­
erican troops have crossed the fron­
tier and penetrated the Mexican ter­
ritory and are now at a place called
Tino, some 70 miles to the south of
the frontier. This newly affected
passage of these troops without the
consent of the Mexican government
places in grave danger the harmony
and relations which ought to exist
between the government of the Unit­
ed States and Mexico.
Violation of Sovereiflnty
"This government must consider
this last act a violation of its sover­
eignty, and asks in the most urgent
nipnner that the Washingtou govern­
ment consider with cara ihe case,
and once and for all define with ex­
actitude the policy it intends to pur­
sue with respect to the Mexican na­
tion. To the end of making clearer
the basis upon which the petition con­
tained in the present note is found­
ed, it is necessary carefully to state
th facts which have occurred up to
this time as a result of the Incursion
of a band on Columbus, N. M., cap­
tained by Francisco Villa, at dawn on
March 9, last."
