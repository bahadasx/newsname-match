SKAGIT AND LOCAL
FAIR DATESCONFUCT
A conflict In dates between tbe
191t; Whmc.om County and Skagi
cunty fairs is now troubling >)e
local directors. Botli fairs have
teen scheduled for the week be
ginning Oct. 2.
The Whatcom County Pair dates
were selected after the directors
had been advised that the datm of
the Burlington exhibition wouid
include the last week in Septeuibe*',
as last year. A new board of di
rectors was named for the Skagit
GoMty Fair, however, and ihe
dites were shifted to tnot,e arblefa
Wn. tcom County has had for sev
eral years past.
Because of the concessionaires
who travel from one fair to tha oth
er and t v o i whom a POP Bide ruble
revenue is it rived, it is J—iruble
thi_t the fr.lr ila.es be kejif s pa>-
ate.
The matter is now 'teing Lake*
up with tba Skagit -iiid ihe
dates of one of the fairs will tie
changed.
That the Skagit people are aux
ions for a change i; evident fron
the folli wing eo.uuont in the Bur
hrg'ou Journal:
The dates of the Lynden and the
Skagit County fa|ei have bo - h ceen
set for the week beginning O'tohe
2 This is unfortunate, as large
itowds from either county desire to
attend both fairs. Last year hund
reds from Whatcom county attend
ed the Skagit county fair, and I
week later when the Lynden i'aT
vas held big crowds from mis
county attended the fair there.
A conference of ihe officials ol
the fairs will be held at Lynden to
see if the dates cannot be changed,
so that they will not conflict.
There is strong friendship snd
interest existing among the dtize :s
of either county, and every oppor
tunity to subserve these relations
should be taken advantage of. So
change the dates if possible.

Cultivation of Character Not the Chief
Business of Mankind
By President WOODROW WILSON
ONE of the most interesting tilings to me is the unchanging charac
ter of human nature. There is a little bit of discouragement
al>out it. You do not have to probe very deep in any generation,
however remote, to find the charaiiteriatics and the seed* and impulses
and the aspirations which we ourselves feel, and it would sometime! seem
as if NOTHING DIFFERED FROM GENERATION TO GEN
ERATION EXCEPT TDK EXTERNAL SETTING OF OUR LIVES.
Man is just the same in one generation as in another, lie wears a
different costume; lie follows a different custom of life, it may tie; inj
speaks this, that or the other language; he professes this, that or the
other creed, hut his is just the same that is to be found in any
other generation and in any other men.
It is sometimes a very troubling thought that in the rush of our
j modern life and in the imperious demand made upon us hv hourly duties
we scareelv have tim-• to think of our individual souls. I think it is fortu
nate we do not have time to think of our individual characters.
1 have no patience with the principle that a man's chief business ia
life is to cultivate his character. That means that his chief business is
Ito think about himself. That is the last person he ought ever to think
i about.
I BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER IS ESSENTIALLY A BYPRODUCT,
i IF YOU TRY TO MAKE IT DIRECTLY YOU MAKE A PRIG, BUT IF YOU
;OO YOUR DUTY TO MANKIND AND YOUR GOD YOU MAKE A CHAR

United States Must Aid Development of
the Southern Republics
By THEODORE E. BURTON. Formtr Senator From Ohio
WREN this war is through, with its artificial prosperity, with its
thriving on the calamities of other nations, then our resource*
will surely experience a phenomenal development. WB MUBX
GO INTO THE SOTJTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS WITH OUB
CAPITAL AND LEND, , , ,
What will be our work? To facilitate exchange; to place our bank
ing business in sharp competition with European banking interests and
the making of treatment*. After tail war I think the center of finance
will be transferred from the banks of that Thames to the banks of the
Hudson. • a *
We should have regular sailings of vessels under the American flag to
carry meill and fi eight both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South
America. We should enter into the details of South American trade
with the same zest as re do at home and not go there for a summer va
cation. Those people, of all the people en earth, should engage our at
tention.
THERE IS THE IMPETUS FOR GROWTH, AND WE SHOULD CO
OPERATE WITH THEM AND AID THEM IN TAKING THEIR PLACE
AMONG THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH.
