NOTED BANDIT SLAIN.

Candelario Cervantes Killed by Gen.
Pershlng*s Men South of Cruces.
Field Headquarters, Near Namiquipa,
Mexico, May 25.?Candelario
Cervantes, the Villa bandit leader,
was killed by Americaif troops south
of Cruces today.
One other Mexican, Jose Bencorne,
and an American were killed. Two
Americans were injured.
When the engagement began the
bandits outnumbered the Americans
two to one, there being twenty of
them. The engagement lasted almost
an hour, with a hot interchange
of bullets. Then reinforcements
from the 7th cavalry came into sight
and the bandits broke for the hills.
Private George O. Hullitte was the
the hero of the fight. Bullets from
ins nne iaia low doiu tne Danaits
killed.
Cervantes'e home was fn Namiquipa.
He has been a thorn in the
. side of the army in Northern Chihuahua
ever since the expedition began,
as he had succeeded in avoiding
persistent cavalry searches. . His
death probably means the breaking
up of the Villa followers in this section.
Gen. Pershing was gratified over
the latest fight, saying that there remains
only a few scattered bands of
y marauders to be hunted down.
/ COMES ON PEACE MISSION?
I -
, Humored Former German Chancellor
Is to Visit U. S. as Peace Delegate.
London, May 24.?A rumor that
Prince Von Buelow is to visit the
United States as a peace delegate is
current in diplomatic circles here,
but up to the present hour it has not
K . been possible to obtain confirmation
L r from any authoritative source.
_ The rumor, however, attracts
much attention in consideration of
the fact that Prince Von Buelow recently
was summoned to see the German
emperor and that, as he has not
been in office during the war he can
disclaim any share in- the waging of
* *. the war.

is said to have been obtained from
diplomatic circles in London.
PEACE IN SIGHT?
American Ambassador Thus Quoted
in Munich. I
Berlin, May 26.?United States
Ambassador James Gerard is convinced
that peace is in sight, according
to an interview published in a
Munich newspaper today from its
Berlin correspondent. Mr. Gerard
is q,uoted as saying:
"Nothing can shake my confidence
that peace is on its way."
The ambassador referred to the
settlement of the differences of the
United States and Germany as prennrirur
wav fnr President Wilson
to take up the question of peace.
"President Wilson," he said, "has
much greater freedom of action now
to deal with the immense world problem
which will determine the future
attitude of nearly all the countries
of the globe.
"It is useless to discuss at this moment
the question as to whether
President Wilson's intermediation is
desirable or probable. In this instance
facts alone must speak and
that the neutrals are probably as
that the neutrals are brobably as
much interested in bringing about an
T
early peace as the belligerents. America.
urgently needs peace and for this
reason alone the American government
is under an obligation to its
citizens to do and support everything
that serves the cause of peace. A
fact of chief importance is that my
government is really willing to take
action for the promotion of peace.
"I am very optimistic regarding
the progress already made of the
idea that the war* should be ended,
even among belligerent nations. The
wise and moderate words of the German
chancellor regarding Germany's
readiness to make peace had probably
their strongest echo in America
and strengthened the impression that
Germany will take all further steps
calmly and with confidence.
"When another step will be taken
and what shape the further development
of the peace idea will take is
not clear. At any rate I am convinced
that my government will leave
nothing undone to support with all
its power peace movements from
whatever side they come. Even although
weeks or months elapse be
fore the thought takes tangible form
nothing can shake my confidence that
peace is on its way." - - '
Referring to the recent crisis in
German-American relations the ambassador
said: "I hardly know from
what quarter the present good relations
between the United States and
Germany could be disturbed. The
establishment of good relations with
Germany is one of the most important
factors of the diplomatic situa"

THE CAPTIVE'S SONG.
How Persistent Singing Caused a
Bird's Relief.
The habit of the thistle-bird, which
always sings persistently when in
trouble of any sort, is a good one to
imitate, says the May St. Nicholas. A
gentleman living in the village of
Silver Creek, Nebraska, had heard
under his window, for many successive
days, the persistent song of one
of these little birds, and finally called
the song to the attention of a nat
uralist friend, who constantly stud- !
ied birds and their ways. Upon in- 1
vestigating the source of the notes, :
the friend discovered that the this- !
tie-bird was a captive in its nest. A :
ladder was brought, and bird and !
nest were taken down for examination.
One leg of the little prisoner '
had become entangled in the wool (
which formed the nest's lining, and 1
it took twenty minutes or painstaKing
effort before the leg was freed. '*
When this was done, the spectators s
were greatly surprised to see the bird
fly away, a trifle unsteadily but apparently
not at all injured. The (
bird's parents or some of its feathered
friends had kept it supplied with
food during its captivity. But the ^
remarkable part of the story is that
its habit of singing was the cause of
its release. '

BRING DOWN BALD EAGLE.
York Man Shoots at Pair, But One
Escapes
York, May 27.?One of a pair of
large bald eagles that had been ranging
about in Bethel Township for
several weeks was killed by Hamilton
Barnett last Wednesday. It appears
that the eagles had been seen
at different times by various people
and that they had caused considerable
interest, their presence having
been made known principally because
of their "scrapping" with the
crows. When Mr. Barnett saw them
they were in a tree near his home.
He procured a single barreled gun

ing papers. The afternoon editions
return to the subject and their comments
together with the wide interest
shown by the public, indicate how
this news is regarded here.
Though definitely stated nowhere
there is little doubt that Germany is
willing to consider a tender of good . j
offices to inaugurate peace negotiations.
The former attitude in the ?
highest quarters that America had
disqualified herself as a peace mediator
on account of her shipments of
munitions to the allies has now
changed. If President Wilson can
hold out any tangible possibilities
that peace may result through his.
mediation Germany will undoubtedly
be willing to consider such sug- gestions
as he may offer.
This receptive attitude is naturally
subject to the conditions that Geimany
is not jockeyed into a position
of announcing her readiness to accept
President Wilson's good offices only
to find the allies later rejecting the
tender and asserting that Germany is
suing for peace. There is equally
little doubt that the great masses of
the people, aside from the professional
hot-spurs in the newspaper offices,
would willingly see America in
the role of peace intermediary, despite
the persisting bitterness over
the munitions questions.
PYTHIANS CLOSE SESSION.
Grand Lodge Elects Officers and Ad- T?
jonrns Sine Die.
Columbia, May 24.?The annual
meeting of the grand lodge, Knights
of Pythias, adjourned sine die here
this afternoon, about 1 o'clock, after
one of the most largely attended and
successful sessions. The following
officers were elected for the coming
year: Grand chancellor, Alva M.
Lumpkin, Columbia; vice grand chancellor,
W. E. Derrick, Orangeburg;
grand prelate, the Rev. Louis J. Bristow,
Columbia; grand master-atarms,
E. R. Cox, Darlington; grand
inner guard, W. A. Fewell, Rock
Hill; grand outer guard, W. H. Ohlandt,
Beaufort; grand keeper of records,
C. D. Brown, Abbeville; gran4 ' }
master of exchequer, Wilson G. Harvey,
Charleston.
Union was selected as the next
place of meeting.
Several changes were made in the
grand statutes, among the more
prominent being the abolition of district
grand chancellors. The work
formerly carried on by these officials
will be developed upon some officer
of the grand lodge. Another important
change made was the matter of
appointment of committees. Here- t
after the committees will be appointed
from the members attending the
meetings to se^ve during the sessions,
instead of from year to year,
as present.
Resolutions of thanks were extended
to the city of Columbia for the
entertainment, to the proprietor and
attaches of the Jefferson hotel for the
use of the hotel as convention headquarters,
and to the chamber of
commerce for the street car ride given
the visitors Tuesday afternoon.
Several committee reports were
made, which showed that the Pythian
order is growing and improving in
South Carolina.
