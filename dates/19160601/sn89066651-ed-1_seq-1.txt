In the proper column of this
issue of the Hayti Herald will be
found the announcement of
Judge J. S. Gossom for the office
of Circuit .1 udgo of the 38th J udi
cial Circuit, subject to the will of
the voter at the primary elec
tion to be held August 1, 1910.
Judge Gossom needs no jntro
duction from us to the people of
this county, having served them
six years as prosecuting attor
ney, making one of the ablest and
fairest prosecuting attorneys in
the state. He is an experienced
lawyer, broad, fair and liberal in
his views. During his terms of
office as prosecuting attorney it
was repeatedly said of liim that
he was able to take care of the
peoples' interest among the best
lawyers.
Judge Go.wmi has always been
the friend of the poor man. It
made no difference with him
whether a man was rich or poor,
high or low, they all received the
same fair and impartial treat
ment at his hands. He had no
favorites among the lawyers;

they were all treated with the
same courtesy and consideration
one lawyer had no more influ
ence than another. His learning,
experience and ability as a law
yer makes him well qualified for
the office. He is big-hearted',
good-natured, and has a judicial
mind and temperment which
p'couliarly fits him for the im
portant office to which he as
pires. Judge Gossom's friends,
of who he has many, predict that
he will be the next Circuit Judge.
He numbers his friends by the
number of his acquaintences, and
while he is not widely known
among the people of Xew Madrid
county, it is predicted that as
soon as the people of that county
meet him and become acquainted
with him he will have many
friends among them.
Judge Gossom will appreciate
any favor shown in his behalf,
and asks ttiat his oluiins be care
fully considered, and in the
meantime will try to see every
voter.

HAYTI,
WAKING UP.
Keally, the old town is going to
wake ui). Hayti Is to have some
real city paving.
Look through the columns of
the Herald this week and you
will find the resolutions calling
attention to the paving contem
plated, and for which plans,
specifications and all detail work
is ready. Can we actually be
lieve it? Well, it's a fact.
Diamond, Carmine, Emerald
and Rose streets around tho
square are to bo paved with a
concrete base and vitrified brick
blocks on top, and this to be 3(3
feet wide, and with curbing and
all.
Now that the preliminaries are
ready, and the resolutions being
published, let us push the work
to a finish. There should not be
a property owner around the
pquare that wit! make a protest,
and we don't believe there will
be. It will add a value double its
cost to the property adjoining.
Of course, paving of this class,
which is the best, will cost con
siderable. but the payment for
such will be in three easy pay
ments. Come on, let's uet that paving
done, and do some mor.e.
