SCOUTS OF HIGH POINT HAVING
THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES
THE BANKS OF UWHARRIE
ON
(By PAUL A. STAMEY.)
The seven patrols of the Boy Scouts
of
America from HWrb Point are havinj?
the time of their lives in annual en
campment near the well-known Hoover
Hill gold mine in Randolph county. The
tents .ire pitched on Carraway mountain
in plain view of Shepherd mountain, in
a. thicklv wooded location, with the
peaceful Uwharire rivers at the foot and
! smaller streams here and there "-lfclins:
down the mountain sides; with cool
springs studding the hill like diamonds
from which to quench the thirst. Verily,
the Scouts- are . located in an isolated
place and it would take the .een in
sight of the Aborigine to trail them in
therr lair if it were not for the -country
roads that lead you in sight of the place.
As it U the modern paleface does some.
tall scouting to. find.e tenorary qua.
many there be from the Furniture city
who have journeyed several leagues out
of the way in trying to locate us.
ianie Boone never blazed a better
path than did the advance guard of Vic
Scouts who felled many trees in order
to make a possible road from the foot
of old Carraway, to its crest to establish
a village of half a hundred souls over
night with nothing but white canvas for
temporary homes.
As "has been stated there are seven
patrols here under the leadership of
Scout Master W. M. Marr; three pat
rols in the first troup, Bob Whites,
Whippowills, Crows. Those constituting
the Bob Whites are: Howard Hicks, Ar
thur Kirkman, Carlton Kirkman, Neil
Edward3, Bryce Bennett, Frank Weedon,
Lanton Dalton and Moreland Lynch.
The Whippoorwills Clifton Jones,
Earl Smith, James Lyon, Cettie Strick
land, Dewey Hoffman, Lyman Redding,
Max Wall and Herbert Fields.
The Crows George Wood, Williard
Thomas, Reid Marsh, Sam Moore, Dew
ey Foust, Alex Rankin and Shelton
Woodson.
There are three patrols in the second
troup: ISagles, Stags and Wolfs.
The Eagles are represented by Sam
uel Davis, Charles Welborn, Wilbur
Jones, Earl McFarland, Dick Johnson,
Clarence Smith, James McAnally, Van
Sheets and Harold Gilliam.
The Stags Dewey Dodamead, Paul
Stamey, Royster Tucker, Robert Mar
shall, William Lee Smith, Chas. McAn
ally and Roy Gililam.
The Wolfs Clarence Schultheis,
Brooks Reitze!, Paul Gurley, Clyde Nor
man, John Bennett, Raymond Rike and
Albert Owen.
There are two patrols in the third
torup and only one represented the
Owls who are encamped with the
Wolfs, viz: Rupert Pickens, Cary Mere
dith and Neil Williams. : .
vThe following is a sample of each
day's program: . .
Morning 5.35, first call; 6.00, reveille;
6.05, assembly; 6.15, morning dip; 7-00,
breakfast ; 7.45, clean up tents; 8-00, as
sembly; 8.05, inspection of tents; 8-20,
announcements; 8.25 to 12 m., letter
writing, scout work, etc.
Afternoon 12.15, dinner; 1.15, assem

ming call; 5.15, recall; 6.15, supper;
7.15, first call; 7-30, assembly; 9-15,
tatoo; 9.30, taps. . ' . -
The patrol ' that . has the best cleaned

Gee, but didn't that chicken and old

evening. Royster Tucker and Bill Smith
said they ate so many that they couldn't

"those dumplings were so greasy that
they jusl; slid down our throats so fast
that our pouches were full to overflow

they, "when digestion commenced a. half

A TRIP TO THE RENDEZVOUS
OF
THE BOY SCOUTS.
Sunday afternoon the editor visited
the Boy Scouts of High Point and Amer
ica on Carraway mountain in Randolph
county, and after taking several circuit
ous routes, several of which were. wrong,
finally found our destination and a hap
py lot of red blood young Americans.
Some were taking their afternoon dip
in the pond, others fishing, throwing
horse shoes, "cleaning up," lounging
around or suiting their several inclina
tions. ; ( I
On Jhe top of the mountain were some
dozen tents, a splendid scout wagon do
nated by A. T. Wishart, benches and
seats hewn- from nature's local workshop,
while 100. feet further down was the
kitche and commissary and the cook
busily engaged in making chicken dump
lings to go with the several cooked
chickens for the evening meal. There
were a large number of visitors and the
boys were real glad to see the home
folks. The weather was pretty warm,
even on the mountain but at night3
blankets are comfortable the boys say.
Scout" Master Marr has the boys un
der good control and they are on their
honor to be and act as real Boy Scouts.
We took severl pictures ot the sur
rounds which are reproduced here. Ow
ing to the dark light in the woods
they -are not as sharp as desired, but
will give the reader an insight into
things. The boys have a pet king snake
which they are. very found of and many
of them carry it around their necks,
especially Carlton Kirkman, who is dubb
ed the snake charmer. In the picture
Miss Lillian Smith is shown holding the
snake a very large one, too. The kitch
en is also shown with the head cook
busy "drapping" dumplings into the pot.
One picture shows Paul Stamey, of the
Stag Patrol, standing in front of their

tent. The others are general views of
the "tented city" on the Carraway. There
is a high jumper and a scrappy boxer
in the crowd and consequently there is
enough talent displayed to break the
monotony. Mail is received every day
and the boys keep posted on things back
at home. .. . .
Just as we were - leaving . there came
down the pike an-aggregation of hat
less, shirtless, stockingless, shoeless,
Scouts with harps, drurn tin cans, bu
gle, etc., on parade around the mountain
side as the last hour, of activity ere the
sun disappeared behind old father
Shepherd and left a pleasing recollection
as we journeyed, back to the hot, dusty
city. . -

Terrific Electrical Storm
Causes Local Damage
Just before two o'clock Tuesday
morning the home of Chas. Ragan
on South Main street caught on tire,
presumably from a freak of light-
mng sinicmg an electric ngnt wire.
The firemen responded promptly and
saved the house from destruction.
The loss is probably $3,000;' the slate
roof and walls of the second story
suffering considerably from the fire.
No one occupied the house Monday
night, Mrs . Ragan being at the home
of her mother-in-law while Mr.
Ragan was out of town-. The furni
ture and interior of the house suffer
ed much from water, especially on
the second floor and tfcis makes the .
jloss so heavy.. It caught during one
of the worst storms ever experienced
here,, which kept many High Pointers
from sleeping and the nervous ones
were terribly frightened.
The firemen did valiant work af
ter arriving on the scene and per
haps saved other near-by homes
from destruction.
Several severe shocks are report
ed over the city from the electrical
storm. At the home of Dr. J. J.
Hamlin the family received a se
vere shock from the electrical dis
play. The E. C. Henderson home
near the city was struck by, light
ning, one of the rooms and much
of the furniture ; badly damaged.
Fortunately no one was in the house
at the time. In the Southern part
of the city a lady and her child were
almost knocked out of bed but with
out any serious results; an automo
bilist reports having received a mild
jar from a near-by bolt
The big terit on South Main street
school grounds f was badly damaged
by the storm and the services are
being held in the auditorium. The
ministers are in a quandary as to
what to do about another tent when
Evangelist Black comes next week.
No doubt a way will be provided
for an open air meeting for the ser
vices as indoors is too hot a proposi
lion. y
Ice Cream Cone Push Carts
Did you ever stop to Jhihk th
the push carts selling ice-cream
cones are a menace to the public s
health, nr at least those who patro
nize them?
Take a dry, dusty street, and all
streets are in this condition when
there isn't frequent rains, and when
the ice cream can i&. opened and
the cones and cream exposed danger
ous dust naturally gets into the
cream and on the cones and this is
taken into the stomach, possibly
laden with disease germs. No matter
how careful the seller is such things
will happen. .
The City Council should require
glass covered wagons and every
safeguard thrown around such
wagons or refuse to grant these disease-breeding
wagons license to do
business, Greensboro has refused to
grant the ice cream cone push carrs
license for another year and High
Point would do well to take the
matter in hand.
The best thing is to refuse them
license. We are not careful enough
of our peoples health anyway.
The Review has repeatedly called
the City Council's attention to such '
matters of health. We have tr?ed
to get a monthly analysis of the
milk and butter supply just like all
other towns who care something for
the health of ' its citizens, towns '
which place the public's health be
yond dollars and cents. .
It looks like High Point is retro
grading in this all important step .
and surely it is high time we were
doing something.
