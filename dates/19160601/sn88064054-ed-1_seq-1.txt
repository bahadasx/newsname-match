coDtiund On PgO 4
M Judge Lancaster Died Suddenly
At Franklinton Tuesday Evening
. i
Heon. Jos. B. Lancaster, Judge of
the 26th Judicial Court; dropped
dead at the Burris hotel in Frank
linton, Tuesday evening at 7'10.
He had just told friends a few min
utes before that he was feeling fine.
The announcement of his death
was a shock to his friends, not
only in Washingon and St. Tam
many Parishes, but over the entire
state
Judge Lancaster was holding
court at Franklinton and left the
court room about 6:30 and went to
the Burris hotel for his supper. Ab
ner Magee, H. M. Rykoski and Judge.
C. Ellis Ott took supper with Judge
Lancaster. After finishing the meal
Judge Lancastar said that he was
going to make out a warrant for his
salary, and picked up a pen to write
his signature, and while in the act
of signing it, he fell forward. Geo.
Nelms, who was standing near
by, rushed to his side and carried
him to a lounge, but life was extinct.
DOCALUSA BOYS LEAVE TO
DAY FOR CAMP OGLETHORPE
Paul LeBlanc, H. L Gaddy, Bebe
Yeager, Virgil Underwood and Frank
Sullivan, all of Company "G" L. N.
G. will leave today for Camp Ogle
thorpe, Georgia, where they will
attend the training school for one
month.
In any movement for a better city
parish, state or nation, Bogalusa
has always been ready to do her
part, and the sending of five young I
men to the training school, shows
the world that Bogalusa is heartily
in favor of Preparedness.
The young men are being sent at
the expense of the Great Southern
Lumber Co.. and will also receive
their salaries while on the trip.
Eberharts Coming Sunday
The Eberharts, claiming to be
the best semi professional ball
team in New Orleans will return for
a game with the locals next Sunday.
The Bogalusa boys defeated them
earlier in the season by a margin
of one run and the Eberharts are
determined to win the game Sun
day.
Ses Frankliaton For $2000
Frankinton, La., May 28.-William
Magee, one of the four dispensers of
soft drinks who were fined by Mayor
Dan E Sheridan this week for selling
a new drink said to contain a moli
ety of alcohol, entered suit for $2000
damages through his attorvney
gimst the mayor and the town.
For the vast year Judge Lancaster
had been in failing health, but sev
eral months ago underwent an op
eration and he was thought to have
permanently recovered.
He was about 56 years of age
and was elected judge of this dis
trict in 1912 and was a candidate
for re-election at the coming prim
ary. He represented St. Tammany
Parish in the legislature and in
1902 he was elected to the office of
District attorney of this district.
Judge Lancaster had hundreds of
friends in Bogalusa where he visited
frequently and on Mothers Day of
this year delivered the principal
address at Goodyear Park. He
assisted in establishing the Juvenile
court in this city and has done
much work for Bogalusa.
He is survived by a widow, five
children and three brother. He was
a member of the K. of C. Moose, W.
0. W. The remains were shiped to
Covington where the funeralservices
will be held this afternoon.
uIg FEATURE AT MAGIC
CITY TOMORROW MIGHT
Tomorrow (Friday) evening the
big feature "Autumn" will be shown
at the Magic City theater. This is
one of one of the Red Feather
features in which Violet Mersereau
takes the leadinng role and
like a vagrant autumn breeze
she dances through this charming
picture, untouched by the near
tragic situations that threaten her.
It is a remarkably strong and beauti
ful production and the fact that
there will be no advance in the price
of admission should result in the
Magic City being taxed to its capa
city. For regular program see page
5 of this issue.

civil term of the District Court this

BOALUSA PLANS FOR GREAT
CELEBRATION FOR THE 4THW
Meeting Will Be Held next Week When Various Com
mittees Will Announce Their Plans-Baloon
Ascensions Of Attractions
Committees are now at work who I
propose to make the Fourth of July ,
Celebration this year one of the ,
most enjoyable events of its kindI
ever held in this section of the state.
Baloon ascensions will be held this (
year as one of the scores of attract
ions and Chairman Hoppen of the
Amusement committee states that I
he is going to have so many free
attractioms that the program will 1
have to start early and continue
late.
Another feature promised for
this year. will be the fireworks in
the evening, and Chairman Porter
says he will soon be ready to give
an announcement that will hold
the crowds of the evening. Ac
cording to Chairman Haley, of the
finance committee, that work will
start this week on raising funds
and that he expects no difficulty in
raising at least $1000 for the enter
tainment of the visitors and .Boga-I
lusa citizens. Conditions are so
much better this year that he feels
that the merchants will give very
liberally. J. B. Starns promises a
parade on the Fourth that will be
only second to the Preparedness
parade at New Orleans Saturday.
If possible, Mr. Starns will go to
New Orleans Saturday to get some
ideas on the suggestion, as the Pre
paredness will be carried out in the
parade here. He will also get the
fraternal orders of the city to par
ticipate in the parade and possibly
there will be another company of
L.L N. G. here, so with these addi
tional numbers on the parade, not
mentioning the fact that almost'
every automobile in the city will be
in the parade, his committee can
S now promise that the parade alone
will be worth coming miles to see.
A meeting will be held next week
S when the committees will be ex
pected to report on the progress
they have made.
Following is the list of those whom
the public is to depend upon to
furnish an unusual celebration this
Fourth.
