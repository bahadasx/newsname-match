At the close of the June, 1000,
term of court nt Hyden, Judge
Fautknerrode across the country
to Manchester. Here he was met
by a delegation of lawyers, rep
resenting the Hyden bar, preseut
iug him with a handsome gold-
headed cane, with many kindly
expressions of regard. We Imp
pen to know that the Judge stiU
lias this cane and prizes it very
highly,.
If Judge Faulkner was a good
and acceptable Judge in 1000, he
will mukea better one now, with
tH added experiooeof ten years
of service as Jiide and praetjc-attorney.

The Powell County FfsciilCourt
met Saturday pursuant to their
adjournment a few weeks ago,
and the first question brought
before them was the building of
the pikes. Judge A. j . Knox
tarted the ball rolling bv asking
the members of the canrt to ap
point Messrs. K. C. Hull, T. C.
Hall, Jno. D. Atkinson and John
M. .Kefinon, as Commissioners to
superintend the work, and after
confident be discussion during
which the representatives of the
West End Good Roads Associa-
and others tion asked for a Com
missioner from each precinct in
the county, their appointment
uas finally ratified. Some of
those present felt that it would
be more to the interecte of the
county ut large to have inure
commissioners and the associa
tion from here stated their will

nominated Win. Mcintosh and
Jelf Wright as commissioners but
Anally cast his vote with the four
other members to make it unani

Mr. Johu E. Burgher, President,
of the West Eud Good Koads As
sociation, presented a request for
endorsement of the association to
work in connection with the Com
missioners in order to sea that
"this end of the county was look
ed after properly, but this mat
ter wns deferred for future ac
tion." A letter was read from
the Winchester Development As
sociation in which they assured
the members of the Fiscal Court
that they would aid and assist in
every way possible the boiling of
a road to Lulbesrud. Mr. Fra
zier, Secretary of tho Business
Mens' Club, of Mr. Sterling, was
also present and assured the
court that Mt. Sterling and Mont
gomery county would do every
thing possible to help in the
building of the road to the Mont
gomery line and also stated that
Montgomery county would re
surface tho pike from Mt. Ster
ling to Levee and build the pike
from there to the Powell line as
soon as (hey were assured that
this county would build a piko
to meet them.
Altogether, the meeting was
very successful and n great deal
of interest was taken in tlie vari
ous discussions. The members of
