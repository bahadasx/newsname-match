Wilson in Return Says De Fac
tos Must Make Good.
Funston Sends Artillery to Con
front Mexican Troops.
Washington, June 1. There was no
Indication at the state department to
day that the new Mexican note had
produced an urgent situation. A reply
may not be made for a week or ten
days. Various inaccurate statements
it makes will be pointed out. Refer
ences to the effect of American do
mestic politics upon the border situa
tion the suggestion that all Latin
America is waiting to see what the
United States will do to maintain its
protestations of friendship and the
reference to American trade in war
munitions with Europe, probably will
be wholly ignored, although it is un
derstood they would have brought a
sharp rebuke if any less perplexed
and disordered government nad taken
such a course.
Cites Langhorne's Pursuit.
The reply probably will point out
that Major Langhorne's detachment
projected nearly 200 miles into Mexico
in pursuit of the Bouquilla raiders
without encountering one Carranza
soldier or official and that while such
a situation prevails no steps toward
withdrawal will be taken.
The Mexican embassy has distrib
uted copies of the note to some of the
other embassies and legations. Sug
gestion of European influence behind
th.e latest move by General Carranza
were renewed.
The state department instructed
consul Dawson at Tampico today to
take up with Carranza officials the
protest of eighty-four American oil
operators who allege oppresive and
confiscatory decrees.
Washington, June 1. It was stated
authoritatively today that American
troops will not be withdrawn from
Mexico until the Carranza authori
ties demonstrate control of the situa
tion, sufficient to protect the Ameri
can border. A reply to that effect
probably will be made to General Car
ranza's note. President Wilson was
represented today as ready to with
draw the troops when possible but de
termined to wait until the Carranza
forces can control the situation.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing early today took up consid
eration of General Carranza's latest
note. The document contained the
threat of armed resistance unless
American troops are withdrawn from
Mexico and charged inconsistency on
the part of the United States in pro
testing friendship for Mexico while
maintaining within her border an
armed force which Carranza considers
unnecessary.
This country's action or response to
the note will not be outlined formally,
until officials have had time to study
carefullv the text which contains
about 12,000 words. Administration
leaders without exception concur with
the opinion that General Pershing's
column would not be withdrawn im
mediately from Mexico.
Artillery to Douglas.
Pan Antonio. June 1. Three bat
teries of the Sixth field artillery will
be concentrated at Douglas, Arizona,
the strategic point of a district op
posite a region in Mexico where So
nora troops have been concentrated.
General Funston suggested to the war
department a few days ago that such
precautions be taken and the approval
of the department was received last
night. Early morning reports from
General Pershing failed to indicate
any increased activity in the Mexican
forces beyond his lines. The gradual
concentration of Carranza's troops in
the north has been continued. Gen
eral Pershing's troop dispositions have

j HIS BUSY DAY
WILL VOTE AGAIN
Topekans May Try for Audi
torium at General Election.
And It May Be for 7ew, 'ot
Remodeled Hall.
Following the defeat of the audi
torium and city jail propositions,
members of the Topeka Commercial
club appear to be for the most part
undismayed and are now discussing a
plan to submit a similar proposition
to the people at the November elec
tion. Nor is it at all certain that a re
modeled auditorium will be the propo
sition placed before the people at the
next election. It is a question in the
minds of many whether Topekans
would not much rather see an abso
lutely new auditorium erected than to
remodel the old one, no matter how
nearly fireproof and modem a remod
eled structure can become.
Preference on Ballots.
On a number of ballots, voters fa
vorable to public improvements, yet
hating to see a remodeled auditorium
had made a cross mark opposite the
'yes" of the ballots but at the same
time had written:
"I'm stronger for a new auditor
ium." George P. Hay den, city attorney,
was consulted this morning as to the
legality of placing separate ballots on
the auditorium proposition at the No
vember election. This could be done,
he declared, without the necessity of
a petition. The exact steps necessary
could not be outlined by Mr. Hayden
at the time.
LEMON JUICE BATHS
Germans Wash Travelers in Acid to
Uncover Tattooed War Secrets.
Warnemunde, Germany. June 1.
Germany is giving suspected travelers
who depart from her borders a bath
in lemon Juice. This is done because
of the possibility that the traveler may
have more information of military
value stencilled or otherwise printed
on his or her cuticle. .
Citric acid, it has been found, is the
most efficient and least unpleasant
medium which tattooing on the skin
can be uncovered, or writing washed
off. It is stated that in 1907 persons
received the lemon rub at one fron
tier point.

JUNE 14 FLAG DAY
Governor Capper Proclaims Date for
Kansas Celebration.
Governor Capper today proclaimed
Wednesday. June 14, as Flag day in
Kansas. In a formal proclamation he
urged that flags be displayed from all
state buildings and from public and
semi-public places.
June 14 is the nineteenth anniver
sary of flag day. In his proclamation
the governor points to the fact that
at no previous, time, perhaps, has the
American flag meant so much to citi
zens of the nation. The proclamation
urges that flags be displayed from all
public buildings, from school build
ings, libraries, churches and from pri
vate homes and business houses.
T. R. NORMAL CLUB
Emporia Students Organize to
Support Roosevelt.
Believe Education Should Rise
to Nation's Crisis.
Emporia, Kan., June 1. The Roose
velt club, recently organized at the
Kansas State Normal at Emporia, will
hold its first meeting Monday. The
Roosevelt club is the first political so
ciety to be organized at the Normal
in this campaign, and includes most
of the prominent debaters and stu
dents of governmental science of the
school.
"We believe that Roosevelt is the
only representative in public life of
staunch, courageous Americanism,"
says Glenn Perkins, one of the organ
izers of the club.. "W e are organizing
the club on a non-partisan basis, for
we believe that the safety of this
country at this time depends on voters
and leaders acting for once on firm,
patriotic principles irrespective of
party."
"Education in America has never
realized its duty to the nation," says
a faculty member of the club. "Teach
ers have consistently emphasized a
selfish individualism and ignored the
need of definite loyaity and service to
the nation. It has come to a crisis in
education and Roosevelt represents the
one sincere power that can put us
right with patriotic duty."
Of the classes in governmental sci
ence at the Normal a recent straw-
vote snows that two-thirds are for
iioosevelt. Among the backers of the
new club are Glenn Perkins, Clifford
Hall, William O'Connell and E. R.
Barrett, Baker Brownell and W E
Myer of the facultv.
PERKINS ARRIVES
BnU Moose Big Financier on the
Ground.
Chicago, June 1. The invasion of
Chicago today by George W. Perkins,
chief director of the Bull Moose, added
mystery and worry to candidates' row
at the Congress hotel where most of
the G. O. P. aspirants for the presi
dency have pitched their tents.
Perkins's arrival in Chicago was to
characterize the actual beginning of
the Progressive pre-convention activi
ties. .
MEAT FAMINE IN
GERMAN CITIES IS
GROVINGWORSE
Shortage Now in Class With
Butter and Milk.
Army Needs and Cessation of
Imports Are Causes.
HOLD STOCK FROM MARKET
Maximum Price Doesn't Allure
tv Teuton Farmers,
Crop Prospects Lie Between
I Nation and Starvation.
Berlin, June 1. For the first time
since the outbreak of the war meat is
hard to obtain in the capital and larger
cities of the German empire.
"Meat lines' have grown as long as
the "butter and milk lines" and those
forming them must sometimes wait
for hoars before they can procure the
quota allotted by tbeir cards.
Responsible for this condition are
the heavy demands made upon the
meat supply by the army, an almost
total cessation of imports and the gov
ernment's new policy of discouraging
the-slaughter of meat animals before
fattening has gven them their maxi
mum butcher weight. Cattle owners
recently have shown a tendency to
keep stock from market bcause the
maximum price arrangement has left
them with little profit.
Can't Kill Young Beef.
On the necessity of feeding meat
animals to the limit of meat and fat
production the government and the
owners of the stock are one. Both say
that a check in butchering now will
add in about three months from twen
ty to twenty-five per cent to the aver
age meat supply. A fine stand of
grass on meadow on pasture and the
arrival of more Indian corn from Ru
mania are counted upon to produce
this mprovement.
Prospects for a good pork produc
tion are said to be excellent. Last fall
the pork, was poor in quality and
quantity. ln the winter of 1914-15
the government realizing that there
'ould be a shortage in the food stuffs
advised that all pigs in good condition
Be slaughtered and the meat pre
served. This was done but in many
cases the meat was so poorly cured
rrwine to a lack of comoetent heln that
F1 spoiled by the thousands of tons.
Sinoa tnen an fnort nas oeen made
to bring back the pork production to
somethi n g ap proachi n g normal pro
portions. Pork Shortage Serious.
The question now is whether it will
be possible to obtain the foodstuff
necessary to bring this year's animals
to a good weight A good potato crop
would greatly facilitate this, as would
also more Indian corn from Ru
mania, which it is believed can be
obtained
An improvement in the pork situ
ation would ease the shortage of fat
in the empire, which is felt almost
more than the shortage of meat The

HEAR CONTESTS
National G. O. P. Committee
Sits for Trials Today.
Sixty Seats InyolYed; Were 212
Four Years Ago.
Chicago, June 1. The Republican
national committee was called to
gether today by Chairman Charles D.
Hilles for the specific purpose, it is
stated, of hearing contests and making
the temporary roll for the national
convention. No other business will
power to choose the temporary chair
man, so the name of Senator Hard
ing will not be referred to the national
committee for reaffirmation.
The contests involving sixty seats
will be heard and decided by the com
mittee. It is expected the committee
will be able easily to complete the
hearing by the end of the week at the
latest.
Four years ago contests involving
212 seats were, decided by the com
mittee and the deliberations occupied
three weeks. It is said thirty minutes
will be allowed each side in contests
affecting delegates at large and fif
teen minutes to each congressional
district delegates. Contests will be
consolidated wherever possible.
DECLARATIONS OF
WAR CHIEFS KILL
HOPES FOR PEACE
Premier Asquith of England: "The
German chancellor's last speech failed
to indicate that Germany is prepared
to consider peace terms safeguarding
the interests of the allies."
Count Tisza, Hungarian premier In
United Press interview: "So long as
the responsible statesmen of England
and France think as they speak, there
is no chance of peace."
Premier Briand of France: "There
can be no peace until the allies have
won a decisive victory.' -
President Roodzianko of the Rus
sian duma in interview: "Russia will
continue the fight until Germany puts
her cannon in a pile and accepts the
allies' terms."
German high officials in Berlin dis
patches: "There is little chance for
peace until the allies try their offen
sive and find Germany unbeatable."
INCREASED WAGE
All Nonunion Employees of
Bock Island Giren Advance.
From $3 to $5 a Month Is An
nounced in Topeka.
FREIGHT MEN FIRST NOTIFIED
Other Departments Will Be
Giren Word This Evening.
Raise Came as a Complete Sur
prise Locally.
Advances In pay ranging from three
to five dollars a month have been
added to the pay of all nonunion em
ployees of the Rock Island railway, ac
cording to advices received in Topeka
today by officers of the road. All in
creases in pay become effective this
morning.
Increases have been divided into
three classes. Advances of $5 have
been granted employees receiving less
than $50 a month. Salaries ranging
from $50 to $75 a month have been
advanced $4, while a $3 increase has
been allowed employees receiving from
$75 to $110.
The first employees of the road here
to receive benefits of the increase are
those employees in the freight depart
ment. Notification of the advances
was received by the department
Wednesday..
The advance by the Rock Island is
unique in that it applies only to sal
aris of men not belonging to labor
organizations. Through this provision,
members of the four Brotherhoods of
railway employees now demanding an
eight-hour day with time and a half
for overtime are denied participation
in the benefits of the increase.
The order came as a complete sur
prise to practically all employees of
the road here. No intimation of the
proposed Increase was made anywhere
along the system until late Wednesday
afternoon.
HALL MUST WAIT
By a Margin of 368 Totes Audi
torium Bonds Are Defeated.
Taxable Improvements on East
Side Enough Expense for Year.
Owing to the thousands of dollars
in vital Improvements In parts of
Topeka improvements to be paid for
by the property owners the $100,000
bond issue for the construction of an
auditorium and a city jail was defeated
at the special election held Wednes
day. It was felt by the opponents of
the bond issue that Topeka can wait
for these conveniences until the taxes
for recent betterments become lighter.
The vote follows:
For auditorium 2,520
Against auditorium 2,843
For city jail 2,319
Against jail 2,940
A heavy vote against the proposition
was cast in the Second ward where an
immense costly sewer system has just
been installed whereon the taxes for
which are now naturally large.
The defeat of the auditorium bonds
does not dishearten Topeka. The city
is still equipped and always has been
to take care of state wide conven
tions In better shape than any other
city tn Kansas. The present audi
torium seating 4.000 persons is ade
quate for a big majority of the gath
erings In this city. The auditorium is
only one. Topeka has in Memorial
Hall the most beautiful auditorium in
the state. Representative hall and the
onyx senate chamber are always to be
relied upon. The high school audi
torium can take care of 1500 persona
Security Hall, Masonic Hall and many
other buildings of a public nature are
always open to the good people of
Kansas. The churches have splendid
audience rooms for department meet
ings. Topeka, too, abides with attractions,
always interesting to Kansans. To
peka is the capital city of Kansas, her
capital, and she' welcomes in the spirit
of the Jayhawker, the neighbors from
over the state.
Topeka wanted a new auditorium
just like a man wants a new automo
bile. She wanted a more magnificent
home for the entertainment of her
guests. But better times will come.

New York, June 1. Dr. Ar
thur Warren Waite was today
sentenced to die in the electric
chair at Sing Sing some time
during the week beginning
July 10.
Before the confessed murder
er of John E. Peck of Grand
Rapids was sentenced, he
thanked the court for the man
ner in which his trial was con
ducted. Waite entered the court room with
head erect, step firm and apparently
unperturbed. He addressed the court
with suave politeness and without a
trace of agitation, although his voice
wavered with an evident touch of feel
ing as he spoke of his sorrow for his
crimes.
"Very, Very Glad to Die," He Says.
"I thank the court," he said to Jus
tice Shearn, "for the very fair and
impartial manner in which it has
treated me. I also thank the jurors
for the courteous manner in which
they listened to me. I feel that their
judgment was justified. My sincere
thanks are due to the prosecuting at
torney, Mr. Brothers, who was always
nice with me. Mr. Deuel, my counsel,
is also entitled to my thanks. He be
lieved implicitly thta I was not guilty.
"I ask for forgiveness. I am very,
very glad to give my body in expia
tion for the things I have done and I
give my soul freely to rectify my mis
deeds. I hope it will go on and on
forever and ever to purge itself."
Within half an hour after sentence
was imposed Waite was on board a
train for Sing Sing.

Illinois Will Lead It When
Sherman Is Dropped.
Chicago, June 1. Eastern
"old guard" leaders who have ar
rived in Chicago in the last 24
hours are in what is termed a
panic. Where they expected
i ratification, they face a riot. It
jwas a sober, worried lot of men
'who assembled for the first
meeting of the Republican na
tional committee today. '
They had delayed their com-
, ing, assured by their lieutenants
that everything was "O. K.T
They have found their affairs
are far from all right.
They find assurance of this
only :
They can block Colonel Roose
velt's nomination as long as the
"favorite sons" remain in the
running but no longer.
Their Discoveries.
The "old guard" panic is due ta
j these discoveries:
j That the delegates back of th
I "favorite sons" cannot be transferred,
j delivered or man-handled in any way.
j That Colonel Roosevelt is the second
choice with the vast majority of dele
gates back of the "favorite sons." '
i -r Thft the Roosevelt tide is rising and
promises a deluge to "old guard"
. hopes. -
j That the preparedness parade Satur
day promises to be stampeded into a
; stupendous, unprecedented demonstra
! tion for the colonel "the apostle of
preparedness." .
i That the Hughes boom which
! promised a port in the storm if worst
j came to worst, is being battered to
! pieces.
I That the J. Ogden Armour Roose-
! velt committee has stirred up a mighty
host in Illinois and the middle west,
extending in its influence even to the
, far west cattle ranges.
That Frank H. Hitchcock, who
promised a sheet anchor, had made a
mess or tnings.
Hughes Drifting Toward Rocks.
The generals of the "guard," sea
soned veterans of many conventions,
face this predicament:
! With their flagship. Justice Hughes,

j candidate nearly so strong with the

one approaching him in strength with
