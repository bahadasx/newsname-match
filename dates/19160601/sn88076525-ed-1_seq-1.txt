The many elements- of political uncer

interesting:, largely- because it adds a

iticians. It is generally conceded that
he will draw more votes from McCum
ber than from Hanna, but just what the
relative strength of the into principal
candidates was before his entrance
.- also' a bone -of contention among poli
ticians.
There is considerable evidence that
Hanna is gaining strength rapidly over
the state. While His trip' with the
Peace Party is looked upon in some
quarters as having weakened his candi
dacy, yet shrewd politicians are of the
opinion that when the votes are counted
this guess wil be changed. The great
mass, of the reading and thinking pub
lie of North Dakota do not want war and
it is believed that they will give Gover
5 nor Hanna full credit for his endeavor
to assist ihl.bringing about peace senti
went. It is contended that those who
are thoroughly horrified with the pres
«nt Kuropeain War and those who will
grasp at any straw t6 create sentiment
against war will be influenced by the
Governor's attitude. On the other hand,
he has repeatedly announced that he oe
lieves in a reasonable measure of pro
paredness, especially a strong navy, a
.. strong coast defense and enough of a
mobile army to protect our country from

Mr. Hill was born near Gwipfu Ont,
in 1836, and thus he was Hearing his
eightieth birthday. At the age of'ilfte..n
he began to work in a grocery store and
ield that position for three yearfe.
That restless Soottish-IijisJi tempera
ment and his dreams of biggeVvthins'S
than grocery store work, cttttSfed' him to
come to the United States.'. It was in
July. 1856, that he reachedj,USt.^ Paul.

St. Paul was by stage coach in winter
and by steamboat on the Mississippi in
summer.
Wtthout technical preparation of any
sort. Hill took a job as cleric in the office
of the Mississippi Steamship Co., which
he held for nine years. Then-he became
agent for the Northwestern Packet Co.
Two years later—the same year he
married Mary Theresa Mehegen, of St.
Paul—he went into the- general fuel

count, He was the first man to bring
mineral coal to St. Paul. At about the.
same time l:e became station master of
the only railroad entering St. Paul, thus
getting his first specific railroad educa
tion.
Because of tremendous application and
persistent study of commercial condi
tions in Sounthern Minnesota, Hill in
186!) headed the Hill-Grigg .Transporta
tion Co, which also handled fuel. It
was in 1870, however, that he took the
first trip
(in
the wonderful program of
development that has marked his life.
It was this year that he organized
the Red River Valley transportation •,
and began the development ofthe great
Red River valley. Out of this plan grew
a syndicate that finally took over the St.
Paul & Pacific railroad, out of which
grew the Great Northern.
A railroad runniing from the present
site of St. Paul to what is now Minne
apolis, a distance of about ten miles, \^as
the first foundation upon which the greai
Hill system ran between St. Paul and St.
Anthony, a city that occupied the pres
ent site of Minneapolis. The 1857 panic
halted the completion of the road. There
were then only 5,598 miles of railroad in
the United States. That is a little moro
than half the present mileage of the
Great Northern, one of the several roaas
that Hill headed.
In 1860 the road went into the hands
of the state. In the caro of Edmund
Ric6, to whom the state gave the roa 1.
it expanded 202 miles, but in 1873 a^air.
went into financial chaos, with seven
mortgages aggregating $33,000,000.
Holland capitalists held the interests
and they desired to unload. George
Stephens, now Lord Mount Stephen.
Donald A. Smith, afterward Lord Star
geons and Norman W. Kittson bought
the defaulted bonds from the Dutch
holders, placing J. J. Hill as general
manager of the railroad that two other
companies had failed to properly man
age.
The three promoters raised much mon
ey and in May, 1879, organized the St.
Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba railroaa.
with f. capital of ¥15,000.000. The Reu
river und the wonderful commercial pos
sibilities of Winnipeg were the immed
iate goal of Hill. But the enormous ir
flux of Minnesota, pushing over its
western boundaries in to the Dakotas,
caused the road to be pushed in that di
rection as well as toward Winnipeg.
Branches and feeders were thrown out.
These today form "^he network fef-linfes
in Minnesota and'the Dakotas.
In 1869, the Great Northern was or
ganized to merge all the branches and
feeders that had become too large for
the limitations of the Manitoba linr.
This fame year the line, under Hill's di
rection, was pushed to Puget. sound. Tlv.
same year the branches of the Hill con
troJed road nosed into the ore producing
country of northern Minnesota. Organ
ization of steamship companies, operat
ing with the Orient, through Seattle and
in conjunction with Hill's transconti
tal railroad system was the next step
in his building career. In the meantime
the Northern Pacific, a second St. Paul
to the coast line had been put through.
But a Chicago to the coast line was
needed and 1891 the Hill interests, rep
resented by the Great Northern and
the Northern Pacific bought the Chicago
Burlington •& Quincy. The Northern Se
curity Co., to control the three roads,
was formed, declared illegal, under tha
Sherman anti-trust law and dissolved.
In 1897 the 14 railroads operated sub
sidary to the Great Northern were pur
chased by the Great Northern and op-

Bismarck, May 31.—The finances of the
state are in an excellent condition, ac
cording to State Auditor Carl O. Jor
genson. There are no unpaid bills and
$400,000 in the general fund for the pay
ment of current expenses of the state
government. This means that the year
will be completed with a good working
balance in the state treasury.
When Governor Hanna assumed he
duties of office in January, 1913, he
found a total deficit in the general fund,
from the preceding biennial period of
$259,983.05. This large sum' was due
state institutions in the nature of credit
balances unpaid bills and unpaid out
standing warrants against the gerieral
fund. There was also $50,000 which had
been transferred from the wolf bounty
fund to the general .fund, .which had to
be made good, there was also registered
and unpaid Wolf Bounty certificates
amounting to $8,606.5Q as accumulated
claims for the destruction of glande^d
horses amounting to $29,346.
This deficit which totals $347,935.55
has been taken care of during the pres
ent administration, and a good balance
is reported in all of the funds.
