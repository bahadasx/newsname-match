The dance given by the Barnes
Boys' Band last Saturday night foi
the purpose of raising funds for
their annual camping trip, was a
great success. One hundred and
twenty five couples were present,
including people from Winslow,
Flagitaff, Ash Fork and several
other points.
This dance was the biggest and
most successful ever held in Wil
liams. The band girls had charge

Over $134. was raised. '
TO THE WOMEN OF WILLIAMS
The women of Williams are
appealed to, to do their part in
helping the suffering and wound
ed of the terrible war of Europe,
by forming a Surgical Dressing
Committe?, for the purpose.
The appeal is made to each
Church and Society, in the town.
The Surgical Dressing Com
mittee like the Red Cross, knows
no Creed nor Country, is abso
lutely neutral, and seeks only to
alleviate suffering. ' During the
first year of the work, it sent
out three and one half million
dressings and now 10,000,000
Surgical dressings are wanted.
Sometime soon a date will be
set for a meeting, and it is
hoped that all of the women of
Williams will become interested
and active in this needed work.

hold a practice shoot Saturday
afternoon. All trap-shooters are

Announcement Luncheon
Saturday, Mrs. A. Sine and
Miss Sine entertained at lunch
eon in honor of the Misses Mary
Collins, Minna Wissing and Elsie
Hayes, all brides-elect.
The affair was one of many
surprises and was most enjoy
able. Shasta daises decorated the
table and helped carry out the
color scheme of white and gold.
Hearts in the same color were
strung from the chandeliers and
bore the monograms of the be
trothed couples.
I In the center of the table a
J miniature ship "Matrimony"
'sailed on a peaceful sea and
carried a carpo of daisies, hearts
and secrets. Smaller ships des
ignating places, were moored by
golden ropes to tiny posts hidden
in the green along the edge' of
the sea.
Cleverly concealed under a
covering of daisies , and green
foliage was the first course; a
fruit cocktail, while throughout
the luncheon the courses were
served in original style. The
ice cream was attractive in tiny
baskets of cake, the handles of
which were decorated witn gild
ed wi.hbones and white ribbons.
Between courses the time flew
merrily disclosing the secrets of
' the
table and the ship. The
pilings were found to contain
prophecies and character sketch-
es of all present. But the great-
est surprise was the message
borne by the ship "Matrimony"
which was disclosed by the
pulling of its overflowing cargo
of hearts to which were attached
double hearts announcing the
engagement of Miss Elsie Reed
Hayes to Mr. J. P. Roberts.
This called forth great applause
as it was so unexpected, and
later brought showers of rice.
A bridal cake was then set
before the guests of honor and
cut by Miss Hayes, much amuse-

FACTS RELATING TO
WATER!) LIGHTS
Williams having reached the
point of seriously considering the
municipalization of her public
utilities by taking over the pro
perty of the Williams Water and
Electric Company, it has become
important that her people have
definite knowledge of this property.
For the purpose of public informa
tion, the News has gathered some
facts and figures which.it is pleas
ed to submit to its readers.
The source of water supply, as is
probably well known, is one of the
canyons coming down the mount
ains south of town. The Saginaw
and Manistee Lumber Company
has three dams in this canyon and
above the lumber company's dams
is a fourth which belongs to the
water and light company. This
dam makes a reservoir which holds
approximately 10,000,000 gallons.
The capacity of the reservoir i?
admittedly too small and its capac
ity should be doubled which it has
been estimated can be done by
raising the dam at an expense of
not to exceed $3,000.
The elevation of the Water &
Electric, Company's reservoir is
such that it gives a head of about
235 feet to distribute water in Wil
liams and supply pressure for fire
protectior '
Water is conducted from the
reservoir of the Water & Electric
company to our town thru about
30,0(X) feet of cast iron mains
ranging from eight inches down to
four. It is claimed that this cast
iron pipe is as good as new.
practically, siuce the durability of
cast-iron is very great, being us
ually sound ''at 1 00 years and has
been found in fairly good condi
tion after 500 years in the ground.
There are 200 water connections
ini Williams. The water rate is
"fiat", as a rule, and is $2.00 per
month for domestic use and $2.00
additional for lawns with a' min
imum of $10.00 for the year.
The gross income of the Water
& Electric Company from water is
about 66,000. It is estimated by
the company that 300 connections
are possible which w:uld make a
gross income from water of 9,000.
The Part That Light Plays
The electric plant ot the water
and electric company pla3-s a more
important part than the waterworks
in producing income. The com
pany has 150 poles in Williams
carrying about 18,000 feet of line.
The water and electric com
pany's rate for "juice" is 20 cents
per kilo. The income of the com
pany f r current furnished is about
$27,000 per year.
The income of the company
from both sources, water and
electric current is about $33,000
per year. The expense is about
$19,000 per year. This leaves a
net income of about $14,000.
The News will not enter into
any discussion of the most impor
tant question of municipalization
now but will have plenty to say
later.

for some ttme was aompleted last
week and is now in service.
; This is a fine bridge, 100 feet
in length with a width sufficient
for double track. It is a .valuable
improvement to the Can3on road.
Water Co. Says, Not Responsible
The Williams Water & Electric
Company say they are not re
sponsible for the lack of pressure
at the fire last Saturday. The
city located the plug which the fire
department was obliged to use in
a very inconvenient place for this
fire. The city Marshal is supposed
to open the plugs frequently and
flush the pipes This the Com
pany say he surely had not. done,
judging by the amount of mud
which came out of the pipes.

FRIDAY MASS MEETING
WELLATTE!ED
Williams citizens were not very "

municipalizing the waterworks.
The hall was finally pretty well
filled and the meeting was called
to ordflr Inv F1. TV! fjnlrl mlin onto A
as chairman. The report of the
committee was not very full, but it
formed the basis for an interesting
general discussion. After several
points had been brought out which
would have to be considered fully
before purchase- could be under-,
taken. Dr. Morley, representing
the water company, was called to
the floor. Dr. Morley gave the
length of mains in the system;
stated the capacity of the reser
voir; the cost of enlargement to
make the capacity adequate for
the needs of Williams; the gross
net income of the company and
finally proposed to sell the water
works to the city for .1150.000.
taking 5 per cent city bonds at
face for that amount. The com- 1
mittee was continued and instruct
ed to work with tho city council
and Dr. Morley in trying to reach
a basis for taking over the water
works. In a separate article - important
data -relating to the waterworks
and its operation is presented.
Last Thu-sday P. M. sneak-
Gus Reimer and stole $50 out of
a purse in a dresser. Mr. Rei

drawer, leaving valuable notes,
two watches and jewelry. There
is no suspicion as to who did the
job. -
