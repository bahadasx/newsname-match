SHEEP SCABIES FOUND
IN JOHN DAY VALLEY
John Day, Ore., May 29. Sheep
scabies has broken out on the ranges
In the lower John Day Valley, Wheel
er county, according to Dr. W. B.
Henneburger of the United States bu
reau -of animal industry, who recent
ly made an Inspection of the sheep in
that vicinity. So far as Dr. Henne
burger could determine by a prelimi
nary Inspection, the disease is con
fined to one band, although several
other bands are under Inspection.
The infected sheep belong to Mrs.
Donald MacDonald. They have been
grazing on the breaks of the lower
John Day river all sprlngt and It is
feared that they may have spread the
infection to several other bands grac
ing on the same range.
Dr. Henneburger has restricted the
area UDon which the Infected sheep
will be allowed to graze and has ord-1
ered that the Bheep be dipped twice
under the supervision of state or fed
eral inspectors before they be allowed
, to leave the quarantined area. As a
matter of precaution he has recom
mended that several other bands of
sheep In the vicinity be dipped.
ITEMS OF INTEREST-
FROM IONE AND VICINITY
W. R. Wyrick, an extensive farmer
of the Pendleton country, was In lone
the first of the week looking after In
terests in this, section. He has charge
of the farm of Mr. Hastings, west of
this place and early this Spring
planted a large acreage of the same
to barley. The grain Is doing fine at
this time, and Mr: Wyrick expects an
abundant yield. He also states that
grain Is doing much better in Morrow
county than It Is in his part of Uma
tilla, and his report cf conditions ov
er there Is rather discouraging.
Numerous excursion parties are
passing through lone every day now.
They constitute travelers by auto
who are wending their way towards
Portland to attend the Rose show
and visit other points of Interest in
the Willamette Valley. We had ex
pected that when the World's Fair at
San Francisco was over, there would
be less travel of this nature through
our town, but it seems that it has
made little difference and the sum
mer travel promises to be as large as
ever.
Miss Ruth Bowman, who recently
closed her term of school in the Ma
son district on Rhea creek, has gone

plowing a tract of 350 acres of land
for John Harbke, a few miles north
of lone. Mr. Swanson uses an oil
tractor and is able to get over a lot
of land In a day. He finds that It Is
getting too dry for successful plow
ing, though some of our farmers are

An attraction of Interest at this
place Is the little band of Shetland
ponies belonging to Miss Josephine
Woolery. She Is how the proud pos
sessor of six head, and two of these
are tiny colts foaled this Spring. It
is Missj Woolery's Intention to be

that she will prove hersejf capable
of talring good care of It and making
a grand success. ; .- - -
Chas. Pointer and Johnnie McMil

lone ono day the past week on their
way to Portland, where they were go
ing to purchase a new threshing out
fit. The Pointers and McMillans will
have plenty of grain to keep a ma
chine, busy this season. They will
head and thresh.
Nothing but good reports reach us
at present concerning the crop condi
tions round and about lone and Mor
gan. While the weather has not been
as warm as we should like, yet grain
has been growing and the fall sowing
is now beginning to head out well.
Weather conditions are now greatly
Improved and there seems to be noth
ing to prevent an abundant harvest.
A. B. Grover is another farmer of
this section who rejoices over an
abundance of good well water on his
place. He recently had his well deep
ened by Charley Shaver and there is
now an abundant flow which promises
to be permanent.

good people of Lexington to do honor
to the occasion and ' at the proper
moment the old folks were ushered
into the town hall. Mr. and Mrs. Eph

changes which had taken place dur
ing the past fifty years. All of this
progress Mr. and Mrs. Boober have
witnessed since they were married.

strive to work up some enthusiasm in
Heppner and in the event a special
train is run from this city ft) the town

people will no doubt avail themselves
of an opportunity to take an excur
sion trip to the sister city on the
north.

STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE REGENT
THUS EASTERN OREGON GREAT
N. R. Moore, regent of the Oregon
Agricultural College at Corvalis was
In Heppner Sunday, "just to see the
town." A newspaper man, he came
to see the editor in his sanctum, and
hoped to find O. Crawford, former, O.
A. C. student, tuba player and print
er who was about the Corvallis offices
when Mr. Moore first Invaded the
Willamette Valley town seven or
eight years ago. However this
of other days Is now in La Grande,
where the two will probably meet.
Mr. Moore was surprised to find such
a healthy looking town stuck away
off up here in the mountains. While
Heppner 1b generally known as an
unusually good town, most visitors
are surprised to find such evidence of
a truly big country. After seeing
scores of Eastern Oregon towns, the
wonderful shadiness of Heppner
struck htm, and he was enthusastic
over the court house and its trim,
well-kept appearance. Down In the
Valley where everything grows with
out effort, such an excellent lawn
about a public building can not be
found, was Mr. Moore's assertion.
Touching upon Corvallis and O. A.
C. Mr. Moore said in part. "Cor
vallis has really had an excellent
growth and progress In recent years,
and now numbers 6500 people. It
I Is a fine resident town with seven
( miles of paved streets and every mod
ern convenience. O. A. C. Is gradu

Mr. and Mrs. Booher were married
at Darlington, Indiana, and came to
Oregon in 1880, settling first in Uma
tilla county near Athena. After liv
ing there for one year they came to
Lexington and Mr. Booher took up a
homestead north oj that city. Mrs.
Booher Is 68 years of age and Mr.
Boober is one year younger. Mr.
and Mrs. Booher have three children,
two of whom were present at the an
niversary reception. They are Mrs.
, Effie Parker of Palouse City, Wash.,
( and Mrs. Tom Beymer of Lexington.
(Another daughter lives In Canada.
They have 13 grandchildren and 6
great grandchildren. All are living.
Nearly everybody in Lexington at
tended the reception, as well as many
friends from lone and Heppner.
Those who were present from Hepp
ner were Mr. and Mrs. F, M. Parker,
Mrs. Clyde Wells and Mr. and Mrs. S.
E. Notson. Wm. Booher and wife,
Chas., Albert and Henry Booher of
Athena were also present.
Mr. and Mrs. Booher were the re
cipients of many presents among
which were Borne nicely coined dou
ble eagle gold pieces.

eers of Morrow county, passed away
at his home in Portland last S:uday
morning after an illness "r " veral
months. Mr. Quald had been In fail
ing health for the past two years and
he had been spending the winters In
California in hopes that the milder
climate would prove beneficial.
The funeral was held In Portland,
where the deceased had been a resi
dent since leaving Heppner several
years ago. He leaves a wife and one
daughter. Both were with him when
the erf d came. ' . .

County clerk Waters issued a mar
riage license Wednesday to !r, A. Cox

County Creamery brought in refresh
ments of Willow brand ice cream and
Ice cold butter milk. The butter milk
was substantially strengthened with
a "kick," the "kick" being no stron

goes Into the Willow Brand butter.
Mr. Morgan was given a vote of
thanks for the feed, before the mem
bers adjourned.

Regent Moore said every effort possi
ble is put forth to make the work
efficient and at the least cost. The
entire membership of the Board thir
teen busy men from all over the state,
was present at the meeting April 21st
and considered the financial budget
with all the seriousness and care they
give their own business.
While a library building and an en.
gineerlng structure are badly needed,
but one small building, an experimen
tal foundry was authorized. Special
emphasis is to be placed on the exten
sjpn service, now engaged In the
eftort to help the farmers and home'
makers solve their problems. Mr.
Moore said the experiment station de
monstrations at Moro are nothing less
than wonderful. The people of
Sherman County swear by It, and
Banker Barnum gives it credit for be
ing worth a hundred thousand dollars
to that county every year." '
Mr. Moore thinks the Willamette
Valley people should come up into
Eastern Oregon to get In touch with
the big way of doing things, but also
thinks It would be a splendid thing
for us to get down to the Valley to
learn how to take things easy after
we have made our money.
MURDER AND SUICIDE i
OCCURS AT HER1ST0N
Hermlston Herald.
Goaded on by a crazed brain cyying
for a righting of fancied wrongs, Joe
Roth Thursday lay in wait for James
Ralph, shooting him twice and a
moment later turned the gun to his
own head and fired. The shooting
took place just a few minutes past 9
Thursday evening. There was no
warning and both apparently died in
stantly.
James Ralph had been out riding
during the evening and on his return
ran his car up to the front door of the
Sapper Bros, garage. This large door
has no lock on It nor no means of
opening is from the outside. The gar
age was closed and Mr. Ralph did not
have a key to, the side door. He
knew, however, that by taking a
screwdriver he could lift the door
sufficiently to get his fingers under
and then raise It. He did this and
just as he succeeded in raising the
door as high as his shoulders there
were two shots In quick succession
and Mr. Ralph fell backward to the
walk. A moment later a third shot
was fired. Witnesses who had seen
Mr. Ralph run his car to the garage,
open the door and the shooting, sum
moned help and went to investigate.
Drs. Wainscott and Monkman were
sent for and also the chief of police.
Examination of Mr. Ralph showed no
signs of life and the physicians both
rave It as their opinion that death
was instantaneous. A hurried inves
tigation showed that the person do
ing the shooting had gained entrance
to the garage through a side door and
apparently left by the rear door. The
only theory advanced was that Mr.
Ralph had come upon some one in
the garage with no business there and
who had shot to protect hrlmself.
More careful examination later dis
closed the body of Joe Roth lying in
the rear of the building with a bullet
wound in the head.
", As soon as the shooting' becurod a
telephone message was sent to Pen
dleton for Coroner Brown. Accom
panied by Sheriff Taylor, Mr. Brown
hurried down and after on .Investiga
tion called a jury and held an Inquest.
Those who had seen Mr. Roth and
Mr. Ralph earlier In the evening were
called as witnesses. Tom Mooney,
who was in front of the harness shop
about half a block away, told what
he saw. With the Information gath
ered from those placed on the stand
the jury returned Its findings that
James Ralph had died from a gun
shot wound at the hands of Joe Roth
and that Joe Roth had died from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound. When
the coroner searched the body of
Roth a second revolver was found in
the left coat pocket. It had one ex
ploded Bhell. The first revolver was
found near the body and had three
shells that had been fired.
The unexplainable part of the trag
edy Is the cause. Neither Joe nor
Frank Ralph could give any possible
reason. There was occasional differ
ences of opinion between their broth
er and Roth, but not serious and no
more than thought would naturally
follow with the conducting of a busi
ness in which several were associated
together. Mr. Roth's daughter, Mrs.
Hiatt, is as greatly troubled over the
cause as the Ralph boys. Her father
came home with the evening paper
and after reading for a time left with
the word that he was going to the
office. This was the last seen of him
alive by the family. Mrs. Hiatt
knows of no differences which could
possibly have caused the act. The
only possible theory Is that Roth,
brooding over what he considered In
justice from Ralph, became unbal
anced and took this means of re
venge. Even this does not seem pos
sible for Roth had worked for Ralph
seven years before coming here and
they were stockholders in the same
company in this city for four years.
The budding authoress had pur
chased a typewriter and one morning
the ogent called and asked:
"How do you like your typewriter
madam?"
"It's wonderful!" was the enthus
iastic reply. "I wonder how I over
done my writing without it!"
"Would you mind," asked the
agent, "giving me a little testimonial
to that effect?"
"Certainly not," she responded.
"I'll do It gladly."
Seating herself at the machine, she

GRADUATES RECEIVE
THEIR DIPLOMAS
Students of Four Year Course and
Those Going Out From Commer
cial Department Listen to Ad
dress of Judjs'e S. A. Lowell. -David
Wilson Received
Scholarship to Willa
mette V.
Nine seniors of the regular four
year high school course and seven
members of the seniors commercials,
a two year course, were presented
with tleir diplomas at the conclusion
of the commencement program in the
high school auditorium last Friday
night.
The program on this commence
ment evening was opened by David
Wilson, salutatorlan for the class,
who delivered an oration entitled
"Patriotism." Mr. Wilson had his
address well prepared and delivered
it in a manner pleasing. ,
A solo, "The Keeper's Song" by
Clarence Scrlvner, a member of the
class was so well sung that It called
forth an encore. Mr. SCrlvner has a
deep bass voice and sings with an
ease and volume which is Indeed
pleasant to the audience.
A timely subject was outlind in a
clear manner by Loren Mikesell,
whose oration, "Shall we get our
share of world trade" plainly shows
the great opportunity which this
country now has to build up a great
merchant marine. Mr. Mikesell's
oration showed evidence of consider
able study and research work on his
part. It was well delivered.
Miss Cornelia Johnson, class vale
dictorian delivered aVi oration on "A
Man." She took for her subject
Henry Clay.. Had Clay been reward
ed for his patriotic deeds by his
fellow men, the presidency of the
United States would have been the
least they, could have given him, but
according to Miss Johnson, too often
it happens that the truly great and
deserving men of a nation are passed
up for men of lesser worth. Her ad
dress of farewell to the class. In
which she bid goodby to high school
and the high tribute she paid to the
factuly rang with a sincerity which
cannot be 'doubted.
The high school quartet, con
sisting of Clarence Scrlvner, Lester
Ingram, Earl Gordon and Chas. Bar
low, sang the "Rosary" In a very
pleasing manner.
The address to the class was deliv
ered by Judge Stephen A Lowell of
Pendleton. Judge Lowell advised
the members of the class to work for
a definite ideal. His entire address
centered on this theme and he clearly
defined his subject in the course of
his remarks. The Judge is a bril
liant orator and his command of the
English language Is remarkable In
that he is never at a loss for the
right word at the proper time. Tho
school was very fortunate In securing
a man to deliver the commencement
address who has at heart the welfare
of the'masses. His address on this
occasion came up to the usual stand
ard and we trust that the Heppner
public will have the opportunity of
hearing him on many more occasions
in the future.
The diplomas were presented to
the graduates by county superinten
dent of schools, S. E. Notson, after
which the evening entertainment was
concluded by the high school chorus
singing "The Legends of the Bells"
under the direction of Miss Marion
Long, Supervisor of music.
David Wilson was presented with a
scholarship to Willamette University.
LOCAL MAN DISCOVERED
ASBESTOS YEARS AGO
The discovery recently of asbestos
beds near Canyon City calls to mind
the fact that county judge C. C. Pat-,
terson In company with other parties
discovered large quantities of this
substance in the Greenhorn moun
tains. The Judge still has samples of
the asbestos and has displayed it on
various occasions at the county fairs.
Nothing was ever done with the beds
which they discovered, for the reason
that marketing facilities made too
costly and therefore impractical, the
transportation of the asbestos to
market. The beds near Canyon City
are now being developed, the asbestos
being shipped to Portland In its crude
state and there made into the manu
factured article.
