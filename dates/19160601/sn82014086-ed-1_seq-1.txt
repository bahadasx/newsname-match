MM Of
Note Declares That Soldiers
In Mexico Without Consent
ACT CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED AN INVASION
Note Points Out That Much of the Trouble in Mexico is Due
to the Attitude of the United States in Not Punishing
Conspirators in" the United States Who Plotted the
4 Downfall of the Constitutionalist Government and in Re
' fusing to Permit Shipment of Arms and Ammunition In-v-
to Mexico Note Concludes Thusrl "The Mexican
Government Therefore
Bring to an End This Unsupportable Situation and to
Support Its Protestations
by ah Immediate Withdrawal of the American Troops.'
Mexico City, May 31. Claiming that i
the words and protests of the United
States have been entirely in contradic
tion of their acts, and that in spite of
protests not to Intervene in the af
fairs of Mexico, soldiers of the United
States are now in Mexico without the
consent of the Mexican government,
and in violation of Mexico's sove
reignty, the Mexican government now
asks for the immediate withdrawal of
those troops. The request is made in
a 12.000-word note made public at the
foreign office today about , noon.
'.The note recites that American
troops crossed - the frontier after the
Columbus incident without the per
mission of the Mexican government.
The act was not considered one of in
vasion then solely because the United
States said they had misinterpreted
the attitude of the Mexican govern
ment. When the second expedition
crossed the line after the Glenn
Springs incident, the note maintains,
the plea that this was done with the
consent of the Mexican consul at Del
Rio, Tex... is untenable and that act
can only be considered as one of in
vasion. - - .
"The Mexican government therefore
invites the United States to bring to
end this unsupportable situationi" the
note concludes, "and to support its
protestations . and . declarations of
frtnedshlp by an Immediate withdraw
al of the American troops."-
Washington Must Declare Itself.
Maintaining that the protests of
protests of friendship by the United
States and the expressed desire for
non-intervention have been contra
dloted by the acts of the Washington
government, the note says the time has
arrived when Washington mrf.t re
ctors itself clearly and unequivocally
as to its future Intentions toward
Mexico.
An Act of Invasion.

the first crossing of the frontier by

and- denounced President Wilson's Me
mortal day speech as weak.- Cheering
crowds greeted him.
Colonel Roosevelt maintained that
President Wilson used "weasel" words
which sucked the life out of his phrases

men. But I cannot join them In any

there could be no Americans who were

RETURNS INDICATE ELECTION
OF MRS. JOSIAH E. COWLES
As President of the General Federa
tion of Women's Clubs.
New York. May 31. Supporters of
Mrs. Joslah Evans Cowles of Ixs
Angeles, claimed tonight on tne eavly
returns ofrom the balloting that she
had been elected president of the Gen
eral Federation of Women's Clubs by
a safe majority over Mrs. Samuel H.
Sneath of Tiffin, Ohio. The presi
dential election was the crowning
event of the thirteenth biennial con
vention of the federation which closes
Friday.
Of the 2,446 delegates not moie man
1,80 voted, it was asserted. The small
vote was ascribed to the fact that
many of the delegates from the west
and middle west left last night for
their homes while others refrained
from voting because of warm per
sonal friendship for both candidates.
The polls were open from 8 o ciock
until 4. Precautions were taken by
the local biennial board to prevent
electioneering in or about the armory
where the convention sessions are held
and as a result workers for the op
posing candidates were forced to talk
to Drosnectlve voters either in the
street in front of the armory or in
the corridors of their hotels.
Literature brought by the supporters
of Mrs. Cowles could not toe used be-
