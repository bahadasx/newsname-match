Decoration Address
The most sucred spot in all the
country is the grave of an American
soldier. He never took up arms for
conquest nor ambition only for civil
or religious liberty, and for the
breaking of shackles of shivery. The
grave of the American soldier is the
shrine at which burns the incense of
patriotism. Today the G. A. R., the
patriotic W. R. C. and all patriotic
citizens, bring floral tribute to lay
them on the alter of the grave of the
American soldier, including all sol
diers and sailors who have given up
their lives in defense of our country.
. .Our. people, have had a struggle to
make this nation. This continent
was discovered at the time when civil
ana religious liberty was a; thft limit
in the old world. Despotism 'n
church and state had for centuries
held humanity in chains. During the
riuvu nf Oneen Marv the Puritans
were exiled from England. After herj,f,yne
death they returned. I'mler the reign
of Queen Elizabeth many were im
prisoned and cruply used. A number
ttinin stnrttxl for wilderness Anier-
let and landed on Plymouth Rock D-1
cember 22, 1620. Before landing!
they drew up the following declara
tion of principles:
"In the name of God. Amen: We
whose names are under written loyal
subjects of our dead Soverign I-ord
King .lames, by the grace of God of
Great Britian France, and Ireland.
Having undertaken for the glory of
God and Christian faith ami honor of
our country and King to plant a col
onyin.-Norine.il. t u gum. u so.. . ..... (
and in the presence of God and of ,
one another, covenant and combine
ourselves together Into a civil bod ,
politic, for our better ordering and I
preservation, we will enact const!- ,
lute anil irauie rucu jusi ami eiju.ii
laws, drdinances. acts, constitutions
and offices, from time to time as shall
b: meet anil convenient for the good
of the colony. Under which we
promise sub rispion and obedience.
In witness whereof, we have here
under subscribed our names. Cape
Cod. 11th day of November, in the
year of the reign of our Soverign
Lord. King James of eEngland,
France, Ireland and Scotland. Anno
Domino. Ifi20."
Fifteen decades sweep us up to Ihe
historic period of 1776. Great Brit
tains long wars had plunged her into
debt which she proposed to raise by
taxing the young American colonies.
There me epochs big with national
destiny, seen in the battles of Con
ptuntine, the Arm ida of Spain, battle
of Waterloo; the Revolutionary war
stands out preeminent in the wo-M's
interests. On the 4th of July. 177ti.

Pool Hall Will He Allowed to He
main Open with No Playing
Imring Show Week
The city council, at the adjaurned
meeting held Monday night, granted
a saloon license to Homer Wilson to
conduct the saloon formerly owned
by Robert Campbell, on First street.
This saloon had been closed since
the first of May on account of the
petition not having been filed at the
same time as the other five which
wle granted at the first of the mun
icipal year. The regular 11400 li
cense was paid.
Councilmen present at the meet
lnj were Davidson, Welch, Davis,
Moore, Helpbrlnger and Kibble.
A plumbing license was granted to
Vern B. Musser for the year.
The pool halls requested the priv
ilege of remaining open after mid
night during the Wortham Show
week with the understanding that no
pool playing would be allowed after
that hour. On account of the fact
that there will be many visitors in
the city at this time the request was
granted.
A petition had been circulated by
the Commercial Club, In order to as
certain the feeling of the. business
men regarding the placing of the
Wortham Shows on Box Butte ave
nue during the week they are here,
June 5 to 10. Fifty-two had ex
pressed themselves as being in favor
of having the shows on Box Butte,
and thirteen against. The council
granted the shows the right to use
Box Butte avenue with the under
standing that they are to place their
shows in the middle of the street,
with fourteen feet of street on each
side open.
The question of moving the city
scales was taken up and it was decid
ed to have them moved to the city
property at the electric light plant.
New curbing will soon be placed In
froiit of the city hall and this would
have 'necessitated the removal of the
scales.
Councilman Davidson took up the
matter of the changing of the loca
tion or the city dump, which now ad-
joins a larm owneu uy mm easi or;
town. .Mr. Davidson Insisted that
something be done and that the loca-;

chased to burn the refuse, stating
that it "was only a matter of time"
until he would lile an injunction
against the city and sue for damages
if the dump was not changed. The
matter is being considered by the
mayor and council and some action
will undoubtedly be taken.

Bachman's hippodrome and train
ed wild animal circus, with its leop
ards, big black bears and forest-bred
African lions, is conceded by all to
be the best and biggest animal show
in America today.
The Oriental show, with its famed
skilled trained far-East dancers, Is
an attraction where all the native
dances of the. far Fast are presented
by a number of Egyptian maidens
dressed in their brilliant and many

seen In their beloved home town,
Constantinople.
The Whip, another novelty, is the
newest and most thrilling sport yet
offered to the speed-mad. Joy-mad
public. It Is a unique device. Among
showmen it Is known as the newest
ride In the world.
The tlkeme of most attractions
bear a heroic tread in keeping with
