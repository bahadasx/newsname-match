of nt least that amount the committee
Thursday reported to the house the
Nolan bill providing for a minimum

The hill was introduced in the house

The federation sent representatives

MINIMUM WAGE
Manufacturers Call the Proposal
"Socialistic" and of No Ben
efit to Workers
The minimum wage is condemned
in a pamphlet issued by the National
Association of Manufacturers. It ar
gues that the proposal is "Socialistic";
that it "takes private property with
out just compensation," and that it
will not help the working class.
Instead of a minimum wage the in
dustrial betterment committee of the
association urges a system of indus
trial education to increase the effi
ciency of the workers.
The report denies any connection
between morals and wages and
charges that a minimum wage would
soon become a maximum.
The National Association of Manu
facturers is the strongest anti-union
organization in the United States.
HOW CAPITALISM
SOLVES PROBLEMS
SAN FRANCISCO—"The case is
dismissed. You may go" said a police
judge to a nineteen-year-old girl who
appeared before him charged with
vagrancy. "But." said the girl to the
court, "what can Ido ? I haven't any
money. I want to get a job- I want
to do right. But where is there any
one who will help me? You tell me
I can go. But where? I am no bet
ter off when you tell me that than I
was before."
THE EVER-SWELLING
STREAM OF PROFITS
Concentration of America's growing
wealth in the hands of comparatively
few men is the greatest danger threat
ening the nation. John Skelton Wil
liams, comptroller of the currency,
declared in an address at a convention
of the Tennessee Bankers' association.
Williams said the rapid increase in
wealth of the United States was pro
ducing an ostentatious leisure class,
which is a danger even more than
angered poverty. In almost exact ra
tio as wealth and capital increase, the
bitterness against wealth and capital
also increases, he declared.
SOCIALIST PEACE MOVE
BOTHERS BRITISH RULERS
The peace propaganda of the Inde
pendent Labor party is hampering the
English authorities considerably. The
war sentiment among the English
people is weakening. The introduction
of compulsory conscription and the
hard measures taken by the govern
ment against English labor leaders
have done much to dampen the war
enthusiasm of large masses. The
British government seems determined
to make itself still more unpopular by
continuing on this course.
SWEDISH SOCIALISTS ON
VERGE OF PARTY SPLIT
Reports from Stockholm confirm
the news that serious differences of
opinion have broken out among Swed
ish Socialists about the policies of the
party leaders. It is rumored that a
portion of the Socialist representa
tives in the Swedish parliament will
form a separate group, leave the So
cialist party and begin the organisa
tion of a new Socialist party It is
hinted that at least 15 members will
be in the new group of representa
tives, under the leadership of the So
cialist mayor l.indhagcn.
He who advocates an open shop is
a detriment to society.

The following, clipped from the

who may be enthused with patriotic
fervor to the extent of being willing

below, it affords added testimony to
German efficiency' and might also be
used by those Socialists who see in
every move of Germany in the direc
tion of increasing her military effici
ency by what is termed the "national
ization of industry." an evidence of
progress towards Socialism, as one
more striking illustration of such pro
gress. If the control of any industry
by a military government for the pur
pose of strengthening its power as

Socialism, then surely the nationaliza

plosives, should be made use of as

Glycerine and Glory
A press dispatch sent out from Chi

Nitro-Glycerine Manufacturers' asso

THE SUPPLY
American patriotism is handicapped
because Germany cannot ship United
States flags to this country.
That unusual disclosure was made
when a committee, representing all
the departments of the federal gover
nment, attempted to buy a large num
ber of small silk flags for the annual
"flag day" celebration in Washington.
All such flags are "made in Ger
many," and the war has cut off ship

been abandoned.

WAR STRENGTH OF ARMY WILL

The militarists have won an even
more complete victory than was an
nounced on Saturday after the House
and Senate had come to an agreement
upon the army increases. Revised
figures upon the army reorganization
bill show that in time of peace Uncle
Sam will have 211,000 man-killers for
use in breaking strikes and backing
war threats and that the war strength
of the army will be 201,500.
The peace strength includes 25,000
staff troops, Philippine scouts and un
assigned recruits, and the war total is
made up of 230,500 officers and com
batant troops, which, with staff troops

"If glycerine is exhausted, it will

the delegates says:
" 'Glycerine is produced but from
one source, animal sinews, and there
is no way of increasing the production
unless we can make use of the bodies
of horses and men killed on the field
of battle ' "
The utilizing of the bodies of
slaughtered soldiers to make more
bombs and shells is said to account for
the inexhaustible supplies of explos
ives with which the Germans are now
bombarding Verdun. Every dead Ger
man, properly boiled and mixed with
nitric and sulphuric acids, may kill
more men after he is dead than when
he is alive. That's German method.
We regard it as glorious and great to
be dead and buried, but the German
is happy in the knowing that his re

loaded into a shell that will do yet
more glorious work for the father

We ought not to be outdone in this
stewed corpse business. Every profit
monger, everyone of us who stays at

for our country. It should ease our
dying moments to know that, thanks
to the advance of modern science, we
can kill more people with our carcass
than we can with our tongues.
There is no limit to the possibility
of this enterprise. What a hell of a

Children and Mothers Must Labor to
Support Families in Penn

HARRISBURG, Pa—The alarming
extent to which boys, girls and women
are utilized to secure "cheap labor"
for Pennsylvania's industrial overlords
is shown in the report of the depart
ment of commerce and labor for 1914
just made public.
During the period covered by the
statistics boys working in 20,571 es
tablishments in Pennsylvania carried
home in their pay envelopes a total of
$2,72:1,000. Girls under 16 were paid
$2,719,500, making a total of $5,442,
--700.
The mothers and sisters of the
youngsters who gave their days and
probably some of their nights to toil
made an impressive showing. The
women employed in the 20,.571 indus
tries reporting drew $72,009,100. They
made an impressive industrial army,
numbering 216,299 in the compara
tively few establishments that served
as the basis of the figures given.
The children and the women were
cheap labor. The investigations of
the department show that in the vast
majority of instances the earnings of
the women and children were needed
to maintain the family. The combined
family income just about kept things
going. In other words parents and
children earned a sum equal to the
amount the father would have been
forced to demand if the youngsters
had been in school, the mother at home
and the father in the mill.
ENEMY (?) LANDS;
NOT A SHOT FIRED
The enemy landed on New York and
advanced towards Sheepshead Bay.
The United States forces, retreating,

Things promised to be full of casual

County Sunday Observance Associa
tion stepped forward and commanded
that not a shot should be fired, for it
was the Sabbath.
Objectors Better "Prepared"
The association was obeyed, in spite
id' the fact that a grandstand full of
people bad paid good money to see a
thrilling encounter, with the crackle
of rifles, the rattle of machine guns
and the boom of artillery. It was
obeyed because its officials arranged
to have Sheriff Louis M. Swazey, of
Kings county, on hand with a threat
of arrest for George P. Dillenbacl
manager of the "preparedness" tour
nament, aided by Police Inspector
Thomas 1' Murphy, of the Coney Is

Much indignation is being expressed |

to the Paris Matin, "each steam
ship which arrives from the Far East
disembarks a new contingent of Ton
kinois and Annamites to reinforce the
hard labor of our factories. To house
these Asiatic workers, a vast camp
has been erected at Marseilles where
there are already over 30 pavilions,
each accommodating 50 persons." In
addition to the Chinese, Moors are

RUMOR WALSH POSSIBLE
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
If Justice Hughes resigns to take
the Republican presidential nomina
tion, will President Wilson name
Frank P. Walsh as his successor on
the Supreme court?
That he will is the report seeming
to emanate from quarters close to the
White House. The President has
shown in the appointment of Louis D.
Brandeis his conviction that the Su
preme court needs judges who are in
formed on social problems. In his
work as the head of the Industrial Re
lations commission, to which he was
appointed by the President, Mr. Walsh
showed that he possesses a fund of in
formation on these matters second to
no man in the country.
That the United States was aping
the worst features of Prussianism, by
creating a military caste, instead of
copying the social legislation of Ger
many, was the charge made recently
by the Socialist member of Congress,
Meyer London, in one of the series of
reports he is delivering to his constit
uents.
between the workers of the United
States of North America and the Re
public of Mexico is pointed out by Mr.
(iompers in his letter, where he speaks
of Ithe united strike of the Mexican
anil American miners in the Clifton-
Mlirenci fields of Arizona. This was
pilactically won by the complete soli
darity of the Mexican miners, who
numbered over half of the 8,000 men
then on strike.
Having no political significance, be
ing entirely international in its aims,
the proposed conference is looked up
on as being the great human touch
absolutely necessary at the present
time to give confidence to the Mexi
can working class in its relations with
the people of the United States. Mili
tary conferences, political conferences,
commercial conferences, all may stage
themselves along the border and all
be regarded by the Mexican worker
as a mere turn of the wheel, which
brings no change in his age-long ser
vitude. But a meeting of wage work
ers, hands clasped across the border
by Mexican and American toilers, will
stand the test of the peon's closest
scrutiny. Only by such means can
fraternity become an actuality be
tween the two republics.

Churchill declared that the allies
now have 200,000 officers with a sim

"These servants and grooms as well
as great masses of cavalrymen, now
idle, should be used at the front," he

The Socialist member attacked the

points: Requirement that senators of

Out That This Is Actual
Wage of Rural Labor
DETROlT.—General T. Coleman
Dupont, onetime powder king, now
king in another line as proprietor of
the Equitable Life Insurance company
and a white house aspirant, has an
article in The Michigan Manufacturer
and Financial Record on agricultural
development and prosperity. Here is
an extract from it:
"It is well known that the farmers
and their wives, with their children
and helpers, are constantly engaged
in strenuous labor, with which a
great deal of intelligence and skill
is mixed. Their work is subject to
peculiar difficulties, and they must
exercise constant vigilance to secure
their output. Notwithstanding their*
extraordinary labors their average
earnings are far less than the wages
paid in the ordinary labor trades in
the large cities.
"This is the common fact of ex
perience, and it is confirmed by an ex
amination of the estimates of farm
earnings per farm in 1912, compiled
by the department of agriculture of
the United States, in comparison with
the reports of average daily wages of
carpenters, stone-cuters, brick-layers,
and others, in the same year, compiled
by the United States department of
labor. The report of the department
of agriculture gives the average net
earnings per farm in 1912 at $18.
, ITI . ...
It is probable that there are, on
the average, five persons to a farm
doing the work of adults and including
men and women. On this basis the
average net earnings of each person
were about $63 per year or :5.25 per
month, equivalent to about 20 cents
for each working day. According to
the report of the department of com
merce and labor the average daily
wage in that year of carpenters,
stone-cutters, brick-layers, locomo- •
tive engineers, and railroad conduct
ors was about $4.50 per day."
ENGLISH SOCIALIST JAILED
FOR MINE STRIKE ACTIVITY
LONDONCapt. James R. White,
formerly an officer of the First Gor
don Highlanders, a Socialist, has been
sentenced to three months' imprison
ment at Aberdare, Wales, under the
Defense of the Realm act.
Captain White, who is a son of the
late Field Marshal Sir George White,
the defender of Ladysmith, was con
victed of having attempted to bring
about a strike of coal miners in order
to force the government to be more
lenient to the rebel leaders in Ireland.
Captain White won the distinguish
ed service order in the Boer war.
Later he resigned and became a So
cialist, going to Ireland to live. In
1914 he took part in the Larkin strike
in Dublin and later became a member
of the Sinn Fein Society. He declared
on one occasion, when asked to rejoin
the army, that he would prefer to be
placed against a wall and riddled with
bullets. ;
