MAKING BIG IMPROVE.MENT.
One of the first up-to-date soda
water fountains to be installed on
our side of the river is now being
made ready for by Mr. Peter Rupp,
who is spending a considerable
amount of money in remodeling his
place of business.
Mr. Rupp has taken in the two
adjoining rooms to his store, and
this, added to his business place, will
make one of the largest drug stores
in this district. The entire drug store
will have a mosaic flooring and the
fixtures will be up-to-date. After
the lower floor has been completed,
Mr. Rupp will construct a two-story
business house by adding another
r story to the present drug store.
a For the past two weeks his many
i patrons have been somewhat incon- ml
venienced in being waited on, and
M.. Rupp desires to take this means
of extending thanks to his patrons
for their patience during this incon- a
venience. hi
The lower floor of the building, U
togethe9 with the fountain and other
- paraphernalia, will be ready In about U
twenty days, when the work on the P
bajance of the bulldnlg will be

OUR PUBLIC FORUM
II---Julius Kruttschnitt
On Financing Railroads
The farmers of
this nation need e
to become better
acquainted with
the railroad men
and their prob
lems. It is only I
those who know 1
that can give us
information and I
the farmers of
America should
listen attentively
to what the men
who manage rail
road property
have to say. Mr. Kruttschnltt, exec
Utive head of the Southern Pacific,
has written an article dealing with I
the inancing of railroads. He said
in part:
"The financtug of a railroad is a I
function which the people, through 1
their servants, the Railroad Commis
sioners and the Legislators, have
never attempted, but it is a most im- 1
portant problem, especially to sec
tions of a State where new railroads
are needed. The placing of securities
has been left entirely with the pro 1
motor and owner of railroads.
"The immediate determination of
what earnings the railroad shall be
permitted to receive and what butr
dens it shall have put on it s in the
ands of eother servants of the pubilc

"Managing a railroad is quite dlffer
ent from managing a government
where the money is raised by taxa
tion. When the expenditures, for
good reasons or otherwise, increase,
taxes can be equally increased. The
railroads, while servants of the pub
lic, cannot raise money with such
ease and facility. The railroads must
keep their expenditures within their
incomes because while they have
some control over their expenditures
they have almost no control over their
incomes, their rates being fixed by
public authorities.
"There is not a railway manager in
the country today who is not fearful
that under the press of increasing de
mands the transportation systems of
the country will, in a few years, break
down, unless the railroads are allowed
to earn larger funds wherewith to
build it up. There are vast sections
of the country, especially in the West,
where more railroads are needed and
they cannot be built unless the rail
ways raise new capital.
"People invest money in order to
make money, and they are skeptical
as to whether they can make money
by investing in concerns that are dealt
with stringently and unfairly. Rail
road securities must be made more
attractive to invite investments, and
in order that they may be made more
attractive, the road must be allowed
earnings that will enable them ws
meet the increased capital charges."
