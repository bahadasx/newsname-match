"DEMAND FOR LABOR LARGE"
Says Prosperity Is Due, Not to War

of Country--Fears No Depression.
(By the Internatiomal News Aervice.)
Raleigh, N. C., May 31.-Secretary
of the Treasury McAdoo. in a speech
before the chamber of commerce here
tonight, sounded the keynote of the
Democratic campaign.
Mr. McAdoo declared the country has
an overflowing dinner paik that money
and credit are abundant, and that the
demand for labor exceeds the supply.
He denied present prosperity in
America is due to war orders, and
gave credit for it to Democratic legis
lation.
He predicted the creation of a
merchant inarine by the Wilson ad
ministration and the expansion of
American enterprise and business in
South America.
Have Full Dinner Fall.
Mr. McAdoo said: "Prosperity has per
meated every corner of the country. We
not alone have the full dinner pail, but
the overdowing dinner pAIl. Money and
credit are abundent: the ghost of panic
has been secnrely laid.
"'This Is due not to transitory war or

"Those great resouroes carry with them
both opportunity and responsibillity-op
portunity to serve the nation's needs in
the highest degree and to extend assist
ance to our splendid neighbors of South
and Central America who are suffering
severely for the resources needed for
their own development.
"I must express my lack of sympathy
with the views so strenuously put for
ward that the United States must face
a period of serious depression upon the
conclusion of peace in Europe. An an
alywls of the conditions in the United
states and of the possible economic ef
tects of the war in Europe does not give
the slightest justification for any fear for
our prosperity.
"The great markets of South and Cen
tral America. which have been clamorous
ly seeking us for the past two years, will
more than offset any possible loss of war
trade.
Great FiPeld for Business.
"Here is a great field for American en
terprise and business; a field which we
would already have securely occupied if
it had not been for the disastrous action
of the Republican members of the Senate,
aided by a few Democrats, in filibustering
to death the bill introduced by the ad
ministration in September, 1914. for the
purchase of $40,000,000 of merchant ships
to be used by the government of the Unit
ed States for the protection of our com
merce with all the nations of the world.
The failure to buy these ships was a fatal
and irretrievable mistake.
"The necessity for the creation of an
American merchant marine for the regu
ion of ocean freight rates and for the
establishment of a shipping board is just
as imperaUtIve now as it was then. A
Democratic House has passed such a bill,
carrying with it an appropriation of $i).
N00.0% for the construction and purchase
by the government of a merchant marine
to be utilised both as an essential naval
auxiliary in time of war and for the use
of our commerce in time of peace"

Result of Harem War
Special to The Washisgton Herald.
New York, May 3.-Prince
Ka-Ku-Ka-La-Ni, who has
three or four islands in the
Malay Archipelago, ten or
twelve thatched-roofed palaces,
a herd of hairlcss goats and
seventeen wives, has come to
this country to study the fash
ions and to learn to be a
ladies' tailor.
The reason for this was a
mutiny in his harem shortly
after a missionary appeared
in the King's domains about
three years ago and exhibited
a directoire gown.
Before that time the prince's
seventeen wives had worn only
gowns that might have been
supplied by the royal goats.
But with the coming of civili
zation in the shape of a di
rectoire gown, they told' the
prince they would get a di
vorce unless he would clothe
them so they could prome
nade on Malay's broadway
without being ashamed of
their clothing. He told his
mournful tale at the fashion
show today.
BIG SUM FOR
NAVAL AEROS
Minority Increases Flying Ma
chine Appropriation to
$3,500,000.
DEMOCRATS PASS ITEM FOR
GOVERNMENT ARMOR PLANT
The Republicans in the House. aided
by a score of Democrats, followed up
their submarine quota victory of Tues
day by increasing the appropriation for
aeronautics In the naval bill from
82.0000 to 33.503,t00 yesterday.
Their efforts to prevent an adoption of
an amendment, providing for the con
struction of a government armor plate
factory, failed.
The minority was also unsuccessful in
attempting to enlarge the provisions for
the enlisted personnel of the navy, but
and amendment offered by the chairman
of the Naval Affairs Committee, adding
,730 men to-the bill, was adopted.
The fight yesterday over the naval bill
centered about the armor plate provision.
which has already passed the Senate. Its
adoption by the House practically in
sures its inclusion in the naval bill. V
Republicans attacked the armor plate
proposal as impracticable. Memers of
the Pennsylvania delegation asserted that
it was a blow aimed at private irdustry.
Democratic members held that the gov
ernment was at the mercy of the armor
plate manufacturers.
The tight centered upon a substitute
plan offered by Representative Butler, of
Pennsylvania, providing that the cost of
making armor at the private plants be
letermined by the Federal Trade Com
mission. The Butler amendment was de
feated.
The amendment providing for the in.
crease of the aeronautics appropriation
was offered by Representative Roberts.
of Massachusetts.
The House's decision on the points 6f
controversy in the bill practically con
cluded the struggle. Amendments will be
offered unt.il Friday, when final voting
begins.

The thinning lines of blue of the Grand
Army of the Republic again will "rally
'round the flag" In Washington's pre
paredness demonstration on June 14.
Nine months ago, the veterans marched
up Pennsylvania avenue in slow step and
tears blotted the vision of thousands of
spectators, because they felt that the
'irand Army was making its last march.
When the 7>,00O or more young men and
women of Washington pass up the Ave
nue on June 14, however, to convince
Congress, by their numbers, that Aner

will find walking in their midst some of
those same Grand Army "boys" who
know from experience that the flag must
be protected.

Wjwright, 1916.)
London, May 31.-A careful investiga
tion by the correspondent of the Sun
News Service of the actual food situation
in Germany reveals the fact that condi
tiors are becoming worse daily. Officials
are no longer able to conceal the alarm
ing state of affairs. The food situation
I actuslly threatening to become the
most important factor of the great war.
A perusal of the German newspapers
discloses a wealth of occurrences reveal
ing the real condition. Complaints are
heard everywhere over the difficulty of
obtaining supplies which are constantly
dwindling. The gravity of the situation
is shown by the appointment of Tortilo
vitz von Batocki as "food director,"
whose first efforte have not succeeded in
improving the situation.
Not only meat and bread, but also
fats, butter and eggs have been placed
upon a card system. The allotment of
ergo to the leading cities does not exceed
three per head weekly.
Draft of Incom
Hits Wealth
Tentative drafts of the Democratic rev
,nue legislation. designed to pay the
price of preparedness and to refill the
depleted treasury, were laid before the
Democratic members of the Ways and
Means Committee yesterday.
The tentative taxing bill was prepared
1v Representative Cordell Hull, of Ten
nessee. the Democratic legislative au
thority on direct taxation, and would pro
vide revenue as follows:
S10,0000 by increasing the income tax;
AX0,000 by taxing inheritances; $40,
.00 by taxing the output of munitions.
The Democratic members of the com
mittec hgan work at once on the income
tax draft prepared by Representative
Ilull, and decided to take up the inherit
ance tax and the munltions tax after the
income tax amendments had been com
pleted.

e of Stews" Is
Food Shortage
Measures taken by von Batocki are
not welcomed by the people. The arrival z
of traveling soup kitchens circulated in
the streets of Berlin was the occasion "
of wild rioting, which the Berliner Tage-.'
blatt reports as follows:
"An attempt by the Charlottenburg au
thorities to relieve the general distress I
hv a distribution through perambulatingir
kitchens containing rspeals of pork, peas,
and potatoes, ended in utter fiasco. Each
kitchen contained 400 pints of stew. A
few minutes after the kitchens arrived
the neighboring streets were thrdnged by
thousands eager to secure a share.
"Drivers and attendants were help
less in the face of the mob of thousands
of shrieking men, women and children,
delivering the steaming stew with pots,
cups. crockery, kitchenware of every de
scription, and even with bare hands.
Hundreds of old men and women, as
well as mary children, were knocked
dwn and trampled upon. Their cries of
distress and pain were heard on all
sides. The "battle of stews" was a
tragedy.
a Tax Bill
and Munitions
The Increases proposed in the tax on
!ncomes will fall entirely on the larger
incomes, under the Hull plan. It does
not contemplate any change in the pres
ent exemption, which allows single per
sons $3,0O and married persons $4,000, bc
fore their incomes are taxable. The Hull
plan would practically double the tax
on incomes of more than $10,000 a year.
It would also provide material changes in
the present system of collecting the in
come tax.
Representative Hull declares the net in
come from the law can be materially in
creased. The provision for inheritance
tax would exempt from taxation all be-i1
quests amounting to not more than S100,-I1
000. Above this amount the tentative
plan would tax the net bequests of all
estates 2%4 per cent throughout.
