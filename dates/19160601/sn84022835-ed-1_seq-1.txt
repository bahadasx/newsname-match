both of Webstur I'ounty, came to his
home, the day beloie Haster, biinging
with them a case of beer triid a gallon
of whiskey. All thiee of the gentle

twentjfotir bonis and dining the
course of events, in a Joking wav Mc
Cmile's friends induced him to say that
ho would not soil his latin and an
agreement was diawn up to tbiseirect.
After this had been done the three

brought bade to his home, where his
"stew", so ho states, lasted for three or
four days 11101 e. It was rumored that
he had sold his farm, therefor lie in-vc-tf-ated
and much to his surprise
found that he had, dining the "spree",
deeded his farm to n ladv. The con
sideration being S2000 und 10 actos of
Nebraska land valued at about 01000,
the total being about $5000 less than
McCoalo's land is actually worth. Pat

Marshnll Honor was kept quite

Sunday morning One of tho boys
got posscsElon of some mail 01 dor
whiskey, of the pugilistic and tree
climbing variety, and having consum

sisted on making himself obnoxious,
until the marshnll induced him to hit
tho trail for the place called home.
Tho imbiber, not content with what
ho had done up town, proceeded to
trim up n few cherry trees in his
neighbor's yard, and when on Sunday
moining made his appeaianco at this
gentleman's houso, to explain tho mat

with a well developed fist and latter

as about a thirty day sample of this
would bo about all some of the trouble
