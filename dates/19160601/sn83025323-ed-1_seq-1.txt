ISAAC M1. MURPHY DROWNED
IN 311LK RIVIR TUESDAY
Malta citizens ere called upon,
again this week to n ourn the loss ol
one of her foremost citizens, I. M
Murphy, who lost h:s life by drown
ing in Milk river Decoration day
Although full particulars of the aw
ful tradegy will never be known the
best we can learn at this time is that
Ike was doing some assessing down
the river near the old John Mer
chant ranch, now owned by J. D.
Wilkes, and had finished at the Carl
Blanchard place and told Mr. Blan
chard he would cross the river at
the old ford and assess Mr. Wilkes
before returning to Malta, thereby
saving the long trip around to the
bridtge.
He left the ranch home of Mr.
Blanchard about seven o'clock and
was seen by several going up the
river to the crossing where he met
his death, which is supposed to have
happened shortly after eight o'clock.
Ike had crossed at the Wilkes ranch
about ten days ago and upon leaving
the Blanchard ranch asked if he
could cross at either place the Wil
es crossing or the Blanchard cross
ing he had formely used, left for
Mr. Blanchard, he not knowing the
river had risen several feet during
the night. Ike perferred the cross
ing he had formerlyused, left for
the Wilkes home.
Mr. Wilks was doing some work
in one of the buildings close by the
river and thought he heard some
one call and went out and looked
around and thinking the sound he
heard came from coyotes resumed
his work thinking nothing more of
the incident until a riderless horse
appeared some time afterwards.
At this time it was not known who
owned the horse and neither was it
thought a man had been drowned
until after several hours search and
inquiry it was found the horse be
longed to Mr. Murphy and that he
was going to theWilkes ranch to
finish up the job of assessing in
that locality.
About the only theory for the tra
gic end is that Ike started his horse
in the river not realizing how high
the water had risen and in trying to
get his horse to go up stream again
st the swift current caused the ani
mal to lose his balance and turn
over in deep water and the bunch
of assessment books Ike carried
over his shoulder it is thought they
acted as a weight and that he sank
almost immediately.
About four o'clock Tuesday after
noon one of the Wilkes boys left- the
ranch with the horse for Malta ar
riveing here shortly after seven
o'clock and notified the two brothers
Arthur and Dave who with a serch
ing party left iinmediatly for the
river.
Car after car loaded with friends
o fthe deceased left Malta Tuesday
evening and night and fast as a car
would return another was filled and
started for the scene of the accident
with friends ready to do anything in
their power to rescue the remains.
The first car to reach the river was
the one driven by Louis Nybo with
Dr. Blankenhorn and T. V. Sharp
following. Ropes and grappling
hooks were used freely in dragging
the river which gave up nothing to
the searchers and during the entire
night men patrolled the banks with
lanterns and flashlights in hopes of
finding the remains of their friend.
Upwards of thirty men spent the
night and they were relieved by as
many more anxious searchers in the
morning. Yesterday dynamite was
used freely inan effort to raise the
body but with no more sucess than
that of the grappling hooks. Late
yestarday afternoon a motor boat
was placed in the river and this will
be used until the body is recovered
and the serching will be continued
by the friends of the deceased.
Death is sad when it visits the
home and removes our loved ones at
any time, but in this case it seems
imiost deplor:ible. Ike Murphy was a
young man dearly loved in Malta,
and we doubt if he ever had an
enemy. For many years he acted as
deputy postmaster under Mr. St.
Hill and in this capicity learned to
know everybody who got mail from
the office and he was always the
same, kind and obliging, ever ready
with a pleasant word for all. When
Phillips county was organized Mr.
Lee appointed him chief deputy and
after the field work was done he
assisted in the office during the win
ter months.
No more popular young man
ever held public office in the city
he so dearly loved and where he
spent nearly all of his young man
hood days.
Recently Mr. Murphy's aged par
ents moved to Malta from North
Dakota and reside in the pretty
bungalow the boys erected for them
in south Malta. The aged people are
nearly prostrated with grief and
they were not told of the tragedy
until early Wednesday morning, as
it was hoped the first report was not
true. The blow falls hard also on
the seven brothers, David, Arthur
and George Murphy of this cty; J. H,
of Joliet, N. D.,; H. A., of Edmonton
Alberta; J. S., of Wren, Ore.; and,
Alec of Pipestone, N. D.
Ike Murphy has been clerk of the
school board for a number of years
and was a prominent member and
officer in the Masonic lodge.
The genial presence of Ike Mur
phy will be greatly missed in Malta
and surrounding country and to the
sorrowing family the sympathy of
the entire community is extended in
their great hour of sorrow.
NOTICE
The question of the boxing contes
proposition has come up to us, Th
Malta Enterprise and the Malta Cal
publishers, in a way that we deem i
unwise to make any comment what
soever on the grounds that it is ask
ing us to draw the line on a topi
upon which our constituents, namel:
the residents of Malta, have proves
themselves to be divided upon.
We have been asked to publist
articles on both sides which if space
were bought and paid for, we woul(
he obliged to publish, but at thie
time we deem it advisable to refuse
all contributions, and refrain fron
any comment whatsoever on the sub
ject. This is not done with any ma
lice, coercion, or intent to suppress
news, but with a devotion to out
commercial, business, and for thE
best interest of our newspapers
which we are operating ourselves.

growth but by the numbers and en

the greet4ng . given them. The ex
