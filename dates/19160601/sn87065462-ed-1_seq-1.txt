J. Alfred Owen, 1
General Sales Agent
Not in recent years perhaps,
has the coming of v any public
character aroused such wide
spread interest as did the visit
of L. T. Cooper., the millionaire
philanthropist, to Atlanta..
Mr. Cooper is described as one
of America's foremost leaders of
advanced thought, and sprang
into fame and fortune through
his new health theories based on
what is known as the Tanlac
treatment. He never ceases to
surprise you with the infinite
variety of his knowledge, and its
absolute correctness and thor
oughness. 1 In several of the
larger cities, especially through
out the South, he has done a
great deal of relief work among
the poor.
Mr. Cooper is a firm believer
in practical philanthrophy, and
his relief work m Atlanta is
already familiar 'to the charity
workers of that city. During
his recent visit there he distri
buted at the Piedmont Hotel,
under the personal 'direction of
of leading charity " workers,
eleven hundred ready-made
dresses of excellent quality to
the poor women and children
Ladies prominent in Atlanta
social life and many prominent
citizens were on hand early in
the afternoon to assist in co
operating with . Mr. . Cooper in
this worthy cause.
A few weeks previous to this
he performed similar service in
Birmingham and donated one
thousand dresses to the poor of
that city. Similar donations
were also made in Jackson,
VicksbUrg, Memphis, Savannah,
Montgomery, Macon, Augusta;
Nashville, Chattanooga and
Knoxville. And his establis-
mentof the now famous "free
bread line" in Louisviller where
he distributed fifty thousand
loaves of bread absolutely free
and without . question to those in
want, proved a, revelation to
charity workers there. ' In fact,
in practically k every city Mr.
Cooper has visited he has always
shown his . great " sympathy or
the poor and unfortunate by per
forming some unique act of
charity; - v-
Mr. Cooper contends that nine
tenths of the diseases and ill

It (s asserted and also denied that
porridge was the cause of Thomas
Carlyle'f ruined, digestion. Sir Rich
ard Qimln said porridge had nothing
to do with his ruined digestion. Sir
Richard stated in the British Medical
Journal ot November 9, ISaS, that "the
wretched dyspepsia to which Mr. Car
ly wm subjected was fully accounted
for by the fact that ha was particular
ly fond of rery nasty gingerbread.
Many times I bar seen him sitting in
the corner smoking a clay pipe and

his celebrated medicine, which is
now accomplishing such remark
able results throughout the
country: not only quickly over
comes all catarrhal inflammations
of the mucous membrane, but
acts directly in the correction of
stomach, liver, , kidney and in
testinal disorders.
Tanlac has been' so convincing
ly proven by the thousands upon
thousands who have endorsed it,
it is also a reconstructive tonic
of great power, and has been
known to entirely relieve the
most obstinate cases of rheuma
tism and blood disorders, in a
very short time.
Itjs, indeed, doubtful if any
thing ever placed on the market
in the way of medicine has
sprung into such popular favor
in so short a time. People every
where have been quick to recog
nize its wonderful merit. The
demand for it has been nothing
short phenomenal. ,
In Atlanta, where Tanlac was
placed on sale seven months ago
over 46,000 bottles have been
.sold, which, according to tie
Jacobs Pharmacy Co., of that
city, has established a new
record and is unprecedented in
the history of the drug business
in Atlanta. In the city of Knox
ville the Kuhlman-Chambliss Co.
sold and distributed 45,326 bot
tles in nine months. In Louis
ville Ky., the Taylor-Isaacs Drug
C6.T who operate eight -pctsil
stores in that city, sold 32,000
bottles in less than .30 days.
Through the Nashville office
alone nearly 100,000 bottles were
sold in six months' time. The
demand for Tanlac in Birming
ham, Chattanooga, and, in fact,
everywhere it has been introduc
ed has likewise been phenomenal,
and the demand for it is con
stantly increasing. - A total of
over one million bottles of the
medicine have been sold in nine
months' time, and it is, without
a doubt, the most widly talked
of medicine in the world today.
When asked ' to explain this
record-breaking demand for
Tanlac, Mr. : G. F. Willis, Mr.
Cooper's Southern representa
tive, said: "There can be only
one possible explanation and it
can be told in one word 'merit'
That tells the whole story. No
preparation, no matter how ex
tensively advertised, can pos
sibly meet with such phenomenal
success, unless it possesses exr
traordinary curative powers." - ;
Thousands upon thousands are
testifying daily that they have
been relieved of disease after
years of suffering by its use.
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN
and in Houlka exclusively by J.

to him on tho part of several thou

ume of the Bible, made especially for
the purpose by the American Bible
Society. Rev. K. Miyazakl and Dr.
K. A. SU!i;.;e, of San Francisco, were
chosen to proceed to Tokyo and make
the presentation. Their arrival was
widely heralded by Japanese press,
their buguse was passed thru the

prohibiting on pain of death Chris

Dr. Sturge, writing of the event, In

great load was lifted from our shoul

Bible, ami this meant that his people
were nerfec:ly free to do the same. !t

study of the word of God will be great

Alaska, Land of Promise
Alaska Is destined to become the
home of millions of people. It is Bituat
td in the same latitude with Norway,
Sweden and Finland whose hardy, la
dustrious population of over ten mil
lion today" is known the world over.
Alaska is larger than those countries,
has a better climate, more arable land
and more natural resources. Alaska
has more gold than California, more
coal than Pennsylvania and West Vir
ginia, more copper than Michigan and
Arizona, more marble than Vermont,
md the only tin mines In the United
States. '
The climate all along the southern
coast, due to the Japan current, is
very much like that of western Wash
ington. At Seward no weather last
year registered zero and the coldest
weather on record U seven degrees be
low zero. There are millions of acres
of land suitable for cultivation. These
natural resources and agricultural
possibilities together with climate
conditions, nre sure to' mean dense
population when once transportation
facilities are provided. The United
States Government has already begun
the construction of the first Govern
ment lailroad, which will lap the
choicest agricultural section, and the
greatest coal fields.
This rich land of promise is so far
largely without churches. There are
only ten towns in the whole yast ter
ritory that have more than one church
each. The scattered natives are large
ly pagan and lire in the most deplora
ble poverty and squalor. A few mls
uions are at work for their uplift, not
ably that of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, but
both in point of Immediate need and
future possibilities should hare a
much greater share of attention from
the churches ot the United States.'
