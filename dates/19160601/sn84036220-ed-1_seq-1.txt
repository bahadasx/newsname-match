CHICAGO, May SI.—Members of the
republican national committee will
meet in the Coliseum at 10:30 o'clock
tomorrow to bear 40 contests involv
ing the right of 62 delegates to sit
in the convention.
The committee will hold daily ses
sions and expects to conclude its work
Saturday so that the temporary roll
of delegates may be prepared by Sec
retary James B. Revnolds of the na
tional committee. Four years ago the
seats of nearly half the delegates in
the convention were in dispute and
the national committee was obliged to
sit for more than three weeks to de
cide the contests.
Comparatively little interest is mani
fested in the contests this time, as a
majority of them are in southern
states and the result is not expected
seriously to affert the chances of the
presidential candidates.
Final plans for the convention were
approved by the sub-committee of
the committee on arrangements of the
national committee, which held Its
last meeting today. The sub-commit
teo approved the following program

T. R. SAYS HE CANNOT JOIN FORD AND
BRYAN IN WILD MENTAL JOY RIDES
ST. LOUIS, May 31.—Col. Theodore
Roosevelt delivered three speeches in
St. Louis today in which he advocated
universal military service, declared the
German-American alliance was guilty
of moral treason aud anti-American
ism, and denounced President Wilson's
Memorial Day speech as weak. Tre
mendous cheering crowds greeted him.
Colonel Roosevelt maintained that
President Wilson used "weasel" words
which sucked the life out of his
phrases and made them meaningless.
"When Mr. Wilson speaks of 'uni
xersal voluntary training,'" he assert-j

m I TRIBU
TO THE HEROES
MEMORIAL DAY SERVICES CAR
RIED OUT TUESDAY AT THE
MYRTLE THEATER.
ORATION OY THE REV. R P. CREGO
Five hundred people joined in pay
ing a fitting tribute to America's sol
dier dead at the Myrtle theater Tues
day afternoon. The theater plut
forin was decorated appropriately
with the Stars and Stripes and At
torney E. G. Worden, a member of
tho Sons of Veterans, presided at tho
services dedicated to Memorial day.
The Rev. E. L. Kechley opened the
program with prayer and following
this Miss Edith Foley sang "The Vac
ant Chair." Mr. Worden, in introduc
ing the speaker of the day, briefly
voiced some excellent sentiments re
garding patriotism and the need of
patriotic citizens.
Memorial C
The Rev. H. C.
speaker, delivered a masi
r *rl :
ij'&o
entirely in keeping with the .,
and stately occasion. He drew from
the history of the world and of the
United States several great lessons
for the problems which this country
is facing today. History has shown
us that a mighty unrest politically,
educationally, economically, such as
the United States is experiencing to
day, precedes some great crisis, and
in the United States should lie the up
lift, salvation and peace of the entire
world. History has shown that great
crises have given birth to great me
morials, and our own Memorial day,
typical as it is of what American his
tory lias been, should serve to ever
increase the obligation of what Amer
ica should stand for in the future.
The history of the past is some
thing definite upon which to base
lessons which should sink deep into
the heart of every American. First,
patriotism and America above all.
Second, a love for the flag and thoso
things it symbolizes — purity, truth
and sacrifice. Third, a reliance
in God—tho God that Abraham Lin
coln trusted when he said:
"I do not doubt; I have not doubt
ed for a moment that our country
would finally come through safe and
undaunted. 1 do not know how it can
he. I do not rely on the patriotism of
our people, although no people have
rallied aroung their king as ours have
rallied around me. I do not trust in
the bravery and devotion of the boys
in blue, though God never gave a gen
eral such an army as lie has given ms.
Nor yet do I rely on the loyalty and
skill of generals, although I believe
wo have the best generals in the
world at the head of our armies. But
the God of our fathers, who raised up
this country to he a refuge and an
asylum for the oppressed of all na
f ions. He will not let it perish now."
Preparedness for Peace.
In closing, Mr. Crego stated that lie
iclieved in preparedness with all his
mart, hut not the kind of prepared
less which will make more of tho
tind of army and navy that we now J
i_____ ...
' 1 IS etiaent,al that we have a

man is greater than Ins munitions and
lie man is greater than the ship. Pre
oaredness should begin with war
sgainst intemperance and vice;
igainst waste and gralt. Patriotism

all, for, us tho poet says, it is brave,
high-minded men that constitute a '
state and it is the man behind the

When tlie speaker had closed his
address the audience sang "America"
H1 , w ® re ou< '° more deeply moved
when Miss Foley sang, as a closing ;
song, "Just Before the Battle. Moth -1
cr." Tho benediction was pronounced !
by Mr. Kechley. i
Final Tribute. :
Immediately after tlie services tho
Judith Basin band, which had ren
dered a patriotic concert just preced
ing the services, led a procession of
veterans, members of the Rifle asso
ciation and others to the graveyard,
where, as a final tribute to the sol
diers buried there, a salute was fired
and "taps" was sounded by buglers
from (he Elks trumpet corps. It was
an impressive ceremony and one
which did honor to the heroes who
have passed beyond.
SUNDAY EVENING UNION SERVICE
The regular Memorial dav exercises
were preceded by the Sunday evening
union service of Presbyterian church,
where a large audience heard the ad

Mr. Roosevelt averred that lie
thought well of Mr. Bryan and Mr.
Ford. "I like them In private life,''
he added. "They are nice, admirable
men. But I cannot join them in any
wild mental joy rides, which is what
I should be compelled to do if 1 should
take their ideas seriously."
Colonel Roosevelt addressed the
largest crowd at the City Club in the
afternoon where lie said that the neu

NEW NOTE
WRITTEN
Carranza Renews His
Previous Request to
Withdraw Troops.
SAYS IT'S INVASION
Note Declares When the Second Ex
pedition Crossed the Line After the
Glenn Springs Incident, tlie Act Can
Only Be Considered at One of In
vasion, and He Invites the United
States to Bring to an End This Un
supportable Situation by an Immedi
ate Withdrawal of the American
Troops—Other Mexican Matters.
MEXICO CITY, May 31. -Claiming
that tho words and protests of tho
United lutes have been entirely In
contradiction of their acts In and in
spito of protests not to inerl'ero lu
the affairs of Mexico, soldiers of tho
United Stales have gone into Mexico
without the consent of Mexico anil in
violation of Mexico's sovereignty, tho
Mexican government lias asked for
Hie immediate withdrawal of these
troops. The request is made in a 12,
000-word note, made public at the for
eign office today about noon.
The note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after tho
Columbus incident without tho per
mission of the Mexican government.
The act was not. considered one of in
vasion then solely because the United
•States said it had misinterpreted,
the attitude of the Mexican govern
ment. When tlie second expedition
crossed the line alter tho Glenn
Springs incident, the note maintains,
the plea that Mils was done with the
consent of the Mexican consul at Del
Rio, Texas, is untenable and I hat act
can only ho considered as one of in
vasion.
"The Mexican government, there
fore, Invites tlie United Slates to
bring to an end this unsupportahlo
nil nation," (lie. note concludes, "and to
support its protestations and declara
tions of friendship by an Immediate
withdrawal of American troops."
Maintaining Hint the protestations,
of friendship by (lie United States and
Hie expressed desire for non-lnterven
lion have been contradicted by tho
acts of the Washington government,!
the note says the time has arrived
when Washington must declare itself
clearly and unequivocally as to its fu
ture intentions toward Mexico.
Allur reciting tlie facts which led
to Hie first crossing of the frontier by
American troops, after the Villa raid!
at Columbus, tlie note insists that, in
contradiction of the word of Generals
Scott aud Funston, another expedi
lion crossed the boundary line, thus
violating all tlie precepts of interna-!
tional law and committing ail act of
invasion.
"The American government," says
tlie note, "has admitted that the work
of Hie expedition which entered after
Hie Columbus raid now Ih over. But
in spite of this fact. American troops
still remain on Mexican soil. To con
tend that political disorder In Ibis
country justifies this act of the Amer
ican military forces is in conflict witli
the repealed professions of tlie Wash
ington government relating to non-in
terference."
Tlie note points out that much of
the trouble in Mexico is due to "the
attitude of Hie United States in not
punishing conspirators hi the United
Slates who have plotted tlie downfall
of Hie present constitutionalist gov
ernment and to the acts of Washing
ton in refusing to perm it tlie ship
ment of arms and ammunition into
Mexico."
Tlie note, which is addressed to
Secretary Lansing, reads, in part, as
follows:
"The Mexican government has just
received advices that a group of Amer
ican troops lias crossed Hie frontier
and penetrated Mexican territory, and
at present is near a place called El
Pino, some 70 miles to the south of
tlie frontier. This newly effected
passage of troops without the consent
of die Mexican government places in
grave danger tlie harmony and good
relations which ought to exist between
the governments of the United States
and Mexico.
"This government must consider
