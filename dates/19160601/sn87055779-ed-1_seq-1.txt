Tlie condemned man. who for the
lose of Mammon. committed all
sorts of thievery, culminating in the
mwnler of his svife's parents, made
a dramatic speech in court today.
I am lad. very, very plad that
I can Kive my life in expiation in
-omo small way for the things I
have done," said Waite he fore J no
tice Shearn sentenced him. "I re
gret that I have nothing more thin
my life that I can give, and I also
freely gise my soul for the same
purpose, and I hap that it may ho
good ami serve forever in any way
that there may ho for it to purge
itself."
Waite spoke with strong tones
and clear enunciation, heard plain
ly throughout the large room. He
was one of the most composed men
pre.-ont. When Justice Shfarn ask
el him if he had anything to say
hefore sentence was passed, there
was silence for a trief space. Then
the convicted slayer hegan his lra
matic recital.
"I would just like to say that I
want to thank this court for the
very fair and just trial that was ac
corded me," Waite said. "I also
want to say thnt I helieve tlie
prosecutor, Mr. Hrothers, was very
conscientious in doing his duty and
at the same time to have heen very
fair to me.
"Also that my own counsel was
always . ind and ahove reproach and
entirely sincere in his helief in re

"That is all I have to say."
As soon as Waite had finished.
Justice Shearn pronounced sen
tence. Walter R. Prul. Wait counsel,
made the usaal formal motions for
a nesv trial and for a dismissal. He
has not filed any notice of appeal,
hut will do so within the 10-day

Immediate'y after the proceedings
Deputy Sheriff Hurke snapped the
handcuffs on Waite's wrist and his

stride ami a Io - swing. With one
keeper accompa ying him. the dep

Waite sat up until after midnight

writing a note to Dr. Prior. The lat
ter was in a cell adjoining Waite's
hefore the litter's trial, and after
confidential talks with Waite gave
valuaMe information to the district

Waite wrote to him:
"I understand that you hase heen
criticized !v fellow prisoners for any
part you may have taken against
rue in my trial. I don't helieve my
forgiveness is necessary, he-cause I
feel anyone who was against me
was ju-tified."

Chief of Police Kerr Requests
Motorists to Turn Off
Bright Lights While
in the City.
POINT TO LESSON IN
WEDNESDAY'S TRAGEDY
Collision With Street Car
Which Brought Death to
Two Example of Dan
ger Involved.
Following Wednesday night's au
tomohile accident in which two were
killed and two more are in a hospi
tal in a serious condition, hecauso,
it is said, an autoist failed to use
dimmers on his headlights. Chief of
Police Alillard F. uerr has request
ed all auto owners to epiip their
cars with dimmers and use them
when passing other machines. This
is only a reiuest from the police de
partment, there heing no state law
or city ordinance requiring the use
of dimmers.
According to the chief of police,
the glaring headlights of automo
biles have heen the cause of num
erous accidents in the city. Since
electric headlights have heen put
into use on a Jtor ohiies, the lights
are so strong frw auto drivers are
hlinöd when they pass other cars.
Although the lights are exceptional
ly hright when they are turned on
full, it ;s possihlo to dim them.
An ordinance requiring auto
lights to he dimmed inside the city
limits was discussed in the city
council, hut no action resulted.
Street cars are required to have
their lights dimmed while in the
city limits.
Mayor Keller said Thursday
morning that he would like to see a
state law passed repuiring auto
lights to he dimmed. He said that
unless it was a state law it might he
hard to enforce, hecause drivers
coming here from other cities might
not know of the existence of such an
ordinance. Charles Frazier, presi
dent of the South Pend and Misha
waka Auto Dealers' association, said
that an ordinance of this kind would
he one of the hest things possihle,
hoth from tlie standpoint of the mo
torist and the general public.
Mr. Frazier said that South Bend
should nave an ordinance similar to
the one in Chicago, which requires
auto 'lights to be dimmed all of the
time tlie machines are in places
where the traffic is heavy. IlUnois
lias a state law rejuiring dimmers
and so has New York. A. K. Sy
assistant secretary of the Northern
Indiana Motor club, said he hoped
that some agitation would he start
ed for cither a city ordinmce or a
state law requiring the use of dim
mers. Say Higher Wages
Cause a Serious
Economic Loss
International New Servte:
WASHINGTON, June 1. A se
rious economic loss has resulted
from the general wage increases
granted hy employers in the United
Mates, according to reports of a gen
eral investigation into labor condi
tions made by federal reserve agents.
The reports made public ty the fed
eral reserve board today state that
as the men can now et as much
money by working short hours as
they did formerly by working long
er, they are laying off and therefore
retarding production at a time when
tho United States is on trial to de
termine whether or not she can
serve the world industrially.
"Then is almost universal com
plaint." says th- report from the
Philadelphia re-erve hank, "that as
.saes are increased a large class of
wace earners heeome less productive
; nd the failure of industrial plants
to make sufficient or reas nabk out
put is presenting the realization of
much, if any, prolit from operations
Instead of taking advantage of the
present wonderful opportunity to
make large earnings, they are ap
parently not netting mieh more
than formerly sshen '.vags sser
much lower. The whole country i.-?

Republican National Commit
tee Takes Up Unimportant
Contests For Seats.
International News Serv-e:
CHICAGO, June 1. Tho ma
chinery of the republican national
convention "was started here today.
The national committee began its
work of making up tho temporary
roll for the consention which sill
assemble next Wednesday at noon.
For the first time in more than 20
years the contests were compara
tively unimportant. They dealt
chielly with personal questions pe
culiar to the localities from wich
they sprang and in no instance were
expected to have any serious effect
on the dans of any candidate for
the presidential nomination.
The contrast between today's
meeting and that of four years ago
was strongly marked. Then the
onto chamber of the national com
mittee rooiö was jammed with a
seething maw of excited delegates
and their friends, all demanding tho
opportunity to present their case to
the committee. The committee itself
wa.s divided in loyalty to William
Hosvard Taft and Theodore Pooso
velt and strong language was tho
rule from thi outset.
Demand for Harmony.
Today tho overwhelming demand
was for harmony. The committee
men discussed the question of cre
dentials and which was and which
was not the proper delegation whose
names should be plaod on the tem
porary roll, juietly and' with a very
evident spirit of conciliation.
The first contest disposed of was
that from the fifth and sixth Vir
ginia districts where double the
number of delegates and alternates
had been e'ected. This question
was referred back to the Virginia
state committee with a request that
the state committee settle the ques
tion. Then Cha.rman Hilles called at
tention to the fact whereas tne 1:;
districts of Texas had each elected
two delegates under the call for the
convention, they svere entitled to
only a Fingl? delegate each. Hilles
recommended that inasmuch as
Texas had acted in good faith all
the delegates be seated with one
half a vote each. There was con
siderable opposition to acting forth
with and finally the entire question
was sent to a committee comprising
Committeenien Smoot and Warren.
The comriittee then ordered all
uncontested delegations plao-d mi
the temporarj' roll and then direct
ed that all contests he taken up al
phabetically. Chairman Hilles then sprang an
other innovation sv lien he suggested
that in all contested cases th- com
mitteemen "rom that state h- re-
quested to refrain from voting on
that contest. This svas agre-d to
without pro est.
