LAND BANK BILL WILL AID MISSOURI
FARMERS TO HELP FEED EUROPE
No Matter What U. S. Government Does in Extending
Rural Credits, Gardner Bill Is First Measure The
More the Better Agricultural Classes in This
State Alone Could Use Hundreds of Millions
of Dollars, at Low Interest Rates, in De
veloping Farm Resources.
By OMAR
When Col: Fred D. Gardner began
work on nil land bank bill, nearly
four years ago, no one foresaw the
great European war at this time.
Though legislation for the relief of
the farmer by enabling him to borrow
money at reasonable rates has been
needed all along, such a measure Is
doubly needed at this time when
America must be the great storehouse
of the world for years to come.
Missouri must do its share. Ours
is the first state In the Union to pro
ject a land bank. The Gardner bill,
passed by the Fojrty-eighth General
Assembly of Missouri, Is to be voted
on under the initiative and referen
dum, in November, in order to settle
all' questions of constitutionality and
avoid court suits. The law Is to be
come effective the first of December
of this year, and in all probability
ours will be the first land bank in op
eration In this country.
You will notice that our federal
government is preparing to establish
12 banks In various parts of the
United States to extend rural credits.
Good! We need all we can get. Sev
eral hundred million dollars could be
used to advantage right here In Mis
souri. Our farmers need a state land
bank and. also would welcome the
chance to borrow from Uncle Sam.
Look at the Ozarks! It's the best
stock, poultry and fruit country In the
world and Virtually is undeveloped!
Look at the thousands of aores of
uncultivated lands In all parts of our
state, -and thousands' of other acres
where attempts' are made to grow
crops but are poor from the laok of
fertilizer and use of good machinery.
An Example In Congress. -
It was pleasing to read how Speaker
Clark got down from his rostrum a
few days ago and "took the floor In be--hair
of rural credits, using arguments
such.' a, cat Gaxdaex an&, oifcac.
sourians have used lor.jears. There's
no question -abour the need of land
banks, nor the- soundness of the plan,
when, as baa- bean proven by experi
ence, European farmers have been
using twenty-five billion dollars at be
tween 8 and 4 per cent interest, and
have Increased their exports of food
supplies while ours decreased.
There's no question, about the safe
ty of the . Gardner measure. We can
lend money to farmers at 4.3 per cent
on long time, let them pay a little
each year on the principal and
through the sale of bonds put to work
many millions of dollars. The bonds
will be the safest investment on earth,
being secured by the land appraised
at half its cash value. The state, in
lending the bank a million dollars as
working capital, will be fully' protect
ed. In time the reserve fund of one
half of 1 per cent, paid by the bor
rowers, will refund the million to the
state, and it will have cost the tax
payers nothing. Just think of it!
From German Banker.
Returning to the subject of Europe,
Herr Gewinner, president of the
Deutsche Bank of Berlin, told Col.
Gardner:
"I told an American railroad presi
dent that American exports of manu
factured articles were not your trou
ble. (This was before the war.) This
is growing and will grow fast enough.
What you require Is development of
your agricultural resources. Food Is
What the world wants and must have,
and the supply is short You must
give your people better educational
advantages, and you must give them
cheap capital.
"If you had good machinery for
rural credits your land bank debent
ures (bonds) would sell anywhere at
as good rates as your government
bonds."
Report From Great Britain.
A remarkable report on agricultural
credit recently was prepared and sub
mitted to the British government by a
large commission of bankers'; farmers,
merchants and laborers men from all
walks of life. This report had much
to do with the back-to-the-farm move
ment and the agitation for . a law to
tax all uncultivated land at a pre
mium. The report lays, in part:
"We shall in the course of our re
port give our reasons .for believing
that much improvement can 'He effect
ed (through land banks) . in rural
credits . WITHOUT IN ANY WAY
COMPETING WITH EXISTING
BANKS.
"Closely connected with the subject
of rural credit and capital for the
Both Country and City.
There are many candidates in every
primary who are strong with the resi
dents of the bigger town. In every
primary there are men in whom the
country voters hove confidence. .- It
is rarely the case, however, that one
man is equally strong with the farmer
and with the man in the big towns.
The party to whom such a man be
longs Is fortunate. Col. Fred D. Gard

ine friend of labor, and as the one

ef the encouragement of thrift. These
Indeed are connected as supply and.
demand. The chief function of credit
is to enable the person making use of
it without any Immediate return of
capital for a period mutually agreed
upon. .
"There must be a good reason for a
comparative failure of agriculture.
"An Industry which is yearly suf
fering from severe competition should
utilise more fully the credit which is
so readily available for any other pro
ductive enterprises."
- Facte From France.
Myron T. Herrick, a noted banker,
when Ambassador to France, studied
farm credits, and he says: "The ma
chinery for credit in the United States
is defective and Inadequate from the
point of view of agriculture. There
are no means whatever for granting
long-time loans. Farmers cannot af
ford to tie up their money for a long
term in the mortgages of neighbors.
There are no arrangements, except in
a few special cases, for promoting the
movement of the people back to the
land.
"The prime object is to create a
system whereby the farmers may use
their savings as circulatory and work
ing capital, and obtain from the gen
eral public all the other funds needed
for improvements."
You will recall that the United
States sent a commission of 100 mem
bers abroad to study farm credits.
Here is a-brief-extract of most im
portant points in .their report:
American Commission's Report
"What the country wants is not so
much Increase in price as increase in
productivity of its farm lands. Farm
credit, therefore, should be productive
and provident." . .
Here let me remark, in parenthesis,
that this p'Qtnt -covered .by- the

not be made for speculation.. The
law provided that the money borrowed
must be used for paying off prior
liens or incumbrances, thus reducing
the interest rates under the old usuri
ous . system, and the balance to IM
PROVE THE FARMS. To continue
with the American Commission's re
port: "Rural credit Is not the same a
urban or city credit Farm credit calls
for special attention and special Insti
tutions. Agricultural credit in the
greater part of Europe- ranks higher
than commercial credit.
"Land mortgage credits rank higher
than Industrial credit. Saving and
trust funds are freely invested in farm
mortgages.
"Land mortgages are always repaid
on the amortisation (easy yearly pay
ment) plan." (The same as In the
Gardner bill.)
"The rapid increase In tenantry In
the United States Is becoming an
.alarming condition. It makes poor
farm practice, poor farm business and
poor farm community."
"European credit Is based on the
land mortgage bond. It is not based
on one man's farm, but on the farms
of many. This bond is bought and
sold In the market like government
bonds."
IT IS UPON SUCH FACTS THAT
COL. GARDNER WORKED AND
CONGRESS NOW IS WORKING.
That our Missouri legislators passed
the Gardner bill is a credit to them.
And doubtless our people will ratify
the measure and thus make MIS
SOURI THE FIRST STATE TO AID
THE FARMER WITH MONEY AT
LOW INTEREST RATES AND ON
EASY TERMS.
Yes, we need the Gardner land
bank, and any further assistance our
farmers may get from your Uncle
Sam. It will bring prosperity to our
own folks and also allow us to help
feed the people of the war-atrlcken
world.
Close to the Soil.
While Col. Fred D. Gardner waa
hoeing cotton and picking the big
green worms off his father's tobacco
patch down In Tennessee he was get
ting a close-to-the-joil understanding
of' the farmer's troubles and the farm
er's problems. This knowledge "of ac
tual farm conditions and his business
career' since leaving . the' old farm
down In Tennesseo has given him. a
peculiar fitness for writing the Gard
ner Land Bank Law to be passed
upon by the voters of Missouri this
fall.
and the trouble to draft a workman
like, safe and sane rural credit law
tor the farming interests of the state.
The Gardner Strength.
The Gardner strength In Missouri Is
not centered in any one locality. The
man in McDonald County is as much
Interested In Gardner as the man
from Pike or Buchanan. His strength
is developing in unexpected places, in
communities where - farmers have
talked a whole lot about rural credits
and a better Missouri and very little
about politic. "

GARDNER IS CENTRAL FIGURE
; ' ' ' '
An Important Meeting of Prominent
Democrats Held at Excelsior
Springe, Mo.'
A political gathering of no small
significance was held at the Elms
hotel in this city, Thursday afternoon,
In which Col. Fred D. Gardner of St.
Louis, Democratic candidate tor -Governor,
was the central figure.
Many Democrats from this section
of the state, learning that Col. Gard
ner would be in Excelsior Springs on
Thursday, came in to see him and
talk over the political situation.
Among those present -were farmers,
bankers, newspaper men, stockmen,
lawyers and doctors and merchants,
comprising the' leading men in their
line of vocation' in ten or a dozen
different counties-
A partial list of those present " at
the meeting here on Thursday is Or.

the Young Men's Democratic Club of
the state, Andrew Craven, H. Clay
Tlndall and Walter L. Bales of this
city.
It is generally conceded In this
part of the state that Gardner is
particularly strong' with the farmers,
and it would seem that a larger por
tion of Francis Wilson's strength
has gone over to Col. Gardner.
Col. Gardner announced here 'that
be positively would take no part In
any factional fight anywhere, that he
would not In the slightest manner
disnarace the claims of the Other
candidates, but his name woulj be
on- the ballot and the Democrats
could decide for themselves as to the
type of man they wanted. The
democracy of this state would honor
itself in making Col. Gardner the
Democratic standard bearer. Excel

- If Missouri ever needed a business
man for Governor, now Is the time.
With the move for great development
being pushed forward In every part
of the state, the help that can be
given by a business head to the state
government, will be a large factor In
the success of the undertaking. We
are' making no criticism of the pres
ent or past administrations. The
future contains great possibilities and
that is where the live ones are look

The latest argument against the
land bank proposition is that It ts
another word for single tax. It Is
more of a dodge than an argument,
however, and coujd easily be refuted
by any man with toe intelligence or
a jaybird. All real estate would be
taxed Just as it always has been. The
mortgages on bonds would be exempt
from taxation, just as government
bonds are, thus enabling the banks
to float them at a low rata of interest
and making it possible for a farmer
to borrow at about two percent be
low prevailing rates. If this la single
tax, the sooner we can get It the
better. H. J. Blanton ln Parts Ap
