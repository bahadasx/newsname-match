COURT SUSTAINS
Fewer of Them to File Ex
pense Statements at
That.
THE MM DETAIL
Not a Single Republican On
the List Spent Over a
Hundred Dollars.
Fifty seven Republican and thirty
eight Democrats filed statements of
the primary election expenses with
the county cleric The discrepancy in
the number of statements filed Is due
to the fact that many of the Demo
cratic candidate! for party commit
tees and Boards of Education in their
! various districts and from whom no
fee is required for filing of their ccr
ftlficates, incurred no expense and did
not file any statement. Practically
I all of the Republican candidates filed
statements althugh many of them in
curred no expense.
Following is the list of men who fil
| ed statements with the amount ex*
| pended by each man according to his
gg computation. The Democratic candi
i dates have to date spent by far the
| larger sum as is indicated by the list
feNone of the Republican candidates
/?., spent over a hundred dollars, tho
i highest being $82.50 by Perry D. Bur
? ton. Jas. W. Davis still holds the high
I record with his statement of $172 and
r C. iH. Bartlett, another candidate for
^assessor on the Democratic tickot is
1 second high man with $139.85.. W. T.
Smith, democratic candidate for sher
iff has spent nearly double the sum
that A. M. Glover expended, his state
i inSnf* being $72.75 while Glover's is
nnly $42.
Following is the list of candidates
?ho filed statements showing their
cpenditure. The names of the can
?? didates who filed statements but did
not incur any expense are not in this

THAT PRIMARY PLEDGE
As .the day for the primary election approaches
some candidates in both the old parties and not a few
political leaders fear that the party pledge which vo
ters are required to subscribe to before they are per
mitted to receive a primary ballot will have the effect
of keeping men of more or less independnt political
tendencies from attending the primaries for fear that
they will in that oath assume a moral if not a legal ob
ligation to support the straight ticket of the party the
candidates of which they helped to select at the pri
mary election.
This would be drawing an entirely too fine point, and
it sincerely is to be hoped that no voter will permit him
self to be kept away from the polls next Tuesday by
any such scruple. The,pledge which voters are required
to sign at the primary polls contains a number of
things, and the underlying purpose of it is to procure a
pure and honest choice and to prevent systematic cut
ting across party lines so that the candidates of one
party are selected by the voters of the opposing party.
The only statement affecting party regularity which
the voter is asked to make is contained in the following
words:
The undersigned do each for himself severally swear or afllrm that
I am a regular and qualified member and voter of the
party.
There is nothing in this which pledges a man to vote
a straight party ticket, or even for a majority of the
candidates on the ticket of his party, as is the case in
some of the states where the primary laws are more
specific on this point. Most men regard themselves
as a member of some party even when they have for
years made a practice of voting without regard to par
ty lines at the general election. There is nothing in
the primary pledge of this state which legally binds
such men to support the whole of a ticket which they
have helped to nominate. That being the case there
is not the slightest reason why even the voters who are
most independent politically should not take the pri
mary pledge and at the general election vote with a
clear conscience for the candidates they deem best fit
ted for the offices.
The foregoing arlcle was submitted to a numbor of prominent legal
authorities of both the Republican and Democratic parties and each of
the men consulted was agreed as to the correctness of our views as stat
ed. Most of the men conculted, however, seemed to think that whether
or not a man supported at the general election such candidates he had
voted for at the primary depended entirely on his own conscience. At
torneys W. S. Meredith, Tusca Morris, Jas. A. Meredith, Walter Hagger
ty, Judge G. A. Vincent were among the members of the bar whose opin
ions were asked.

GERMAN FAILURE
FRENCH SUCCESS
SAY 1HE EXPERTS
Fiercest Infantry Fighting
of the War Before
Verdun.
FROM MAY2TTQ MAY30
Heavier Guns and Denser
Masses of Infantry Were
Freely Used.
(By Associated Press)
PARIS, June L?The Germans were
completely repulsed In attacks deliv
ered on French positions at Dead
Man hill about 8 o'clock last night,
according to an official statement is
sued b ythe French War office /oday.
A violent bombardment continued
in this region throughout the night.
An intense artillery duel is in progress
on the east and west front at Douau
mont.
More complete accounts reaching
Verdun show that the battle which
raged from May 27 to May 30 and
which ended in costly check for the
Germans was the greatest effort made i
by tho Teutonic forces in the whole
Verdun operation. More and heavier
guns and denser masses of troops
were assembled along the three mile
of the French front from Hill 304 to
the Metfse than in any provious at
tack. The Fronch stood rm under an
avalanche of shot and shell an ddrovo
back wave after wave of a flood of
Teutonic infantry.
They only surrendered about 100
yards of ground at little Caurettes
woods where a trench had been oblit
erated by the terrlffic fire of the Ger*
man^bigttiwr* \ y
According to information given by
German prisoners the German forces
consisted of two fresh brigades with
two companies of pioneers. The mis
sion of the latter troops was to work
around Cumleres and reach the Chat
tancourt village by the road running
parallel to the railroad. In the mean
time two other regiments were ordered
to creep along the banks of the river
and sleze the Chattancourt railroad
station to the west of tho village. An
other brigade was instructed to storm
the woods and hedgesows which bor
der Chattancour to the west whilo
other detachments acting still farther
to tho west were to support the at
tack. In he opinion of French mili
tary critics the result was not only
a costly failure for the Germans but
a success for tho French iuch as they
havo rarely attained.
The Germans suffered so heavily
that thoy ceased further attack wiiil*
tho French by a prompt counter at
tack re-established themselves again
south of Cumieres and won an import
ant point of cantago, on the south
west slope of Dead Man hill.
It developed that during yesterday's
battle west of the Mouse the Germans
set back the French lines between
Dead Man hill and Cumipres for a
distanco of threequarters of a mile.
The French battalion which had re
tired before the unprecedented artil
lery fire reformed and made a des
perate counter attack supported by
reinforcements. After nearly two
hours of violent fighting they recover
ed nil tho lost ground.
The Inrantry fighting in this strug
glo is rescrlbed as the fiercest of the
war.

Interesting Present Application
Sermons are tiresome, and the dally
stories of the West Virginian's 7,000

preaching. But there are a largo num

secure their share of the $3,200 in big
cash and merchandise awards which
the West Virginian will soon distri
bute free among It's readers and
friendi.
We all know the old story of the
ant and the grasshopper.
La Fontaine in his fable told it to
tho French and to all the civilized
world.
Aesop the Greek, two thousand five
hundred years ago, taught the story 1
to tho French writer.
And to Aesop the story came from I
Asia. Where the Asiatic writer got
it we do not know.
We know it is the story as old as
human intelligence, but always new I
and true, and particusrly applicable
to those who are interested in the 7,

will not waste your time If you think

OPPOSITION HAS ONEMORE CARD TO PliAl
Application to Federal Courts For An Injunction WH1 Be
Acted Upon in a Short Time?Not Believed
That It Will Be Granted,
(Special to The West Viginian.J
CHARLESTON, W. VA., June 1?The advocates, of I.,
ter and more economical government won a great victory!
today after a four years fight for a better charter for the'
city of Fairmont when the Supreme Court reversed the'
decision of Judge Haymond of the Marion Circuit.Court'
and dismissed the bill of Reuben Anderson versus Mayor
Anthony Bowen and others in the case known as the
Fairmont Charter Case.
The court ha? not prepared its written opinion, but t
decision today sustains the charter passed by the last Leg
islature and makes the act valid.
The charter provides for cleaner elections, registi
tion of voters, reductions in salary, elimination of useli
office holders and just limitations upon all future salaries./j.
It gives all political parties representation on election
boards, which its advocates believe will elimmat
fraud and collusion, making bribery and corruption in
elections practically impossible.
Another victory for the Republican |
organization and good citizens of
Fairmont who are supporting the new
Fairmont Charter'waB won today
when the Supreme Court of West Vir
ginia after reviewing the evidence in
the case and deciding according to
their views as to merits and right re
versed the decision of the Marlon
county circuit court and ordered the
Bill filed by attorneys for Reuben An
derson dismissed.
This decision was announced just
before noon this morning and so far
as the courts of West Virginia are con
cerned establshes the new Fairmont;
Charter as the true and legal ordi
nance under which the local city gov
ernment must be conducted.
A motion of tho Democratic attor
neys who have been lighting the new
charter is pending before Federal
Judge Dayton. This is an application
for an injunction restraining the now
Charter from going into effect The
decision of Judge Dayton has been
withheld while the action of the Su
preme Court was pending and will
now likely be announced. It is the
opinion of attorneys here who are fa
miliar with the case that Judge Day
to will refuse the plea of the Demo
cratic attorneys on tho ground that
the Federal courts do not have juris
diction.
If this turns out to be true the final
resource of these who are opposing
the new charter will be exhausted snd
it will be necessary to put the new
charter into effect and the election
under Its terms which the Democratic
henchmen prevented through their In
unction proceedings will have to be
held.
Tho struggle over this piece of pro
gressive legislation has been stub
bornly fought on both sides. The
Democratic organization used every
expedient of the law to dalay, but it
is a significant fact that every time
they were compelled to make a stand
they were defeated by the friends
of the charter.
The suit was brought originally in
the circuit court hero by Congressman
M. M. Neely and State Senator Scott
Lowe, both Democratic .lawyers, in
behalf of Reuben Anderson, Demo
cratic janitor at tho court house, to
restrain Anthony Bowen. Democratic
Mayor of the city, and other Demo
cratic city-officials, from calling !_
election which would in all probability j
result in ousting Democrats from OtrV
flee. Walter Haggerty city attorney,: p
and a Democrat also, appearedYforJtl^J
defendants.
In view of this situation ReppbfaUtt^
and other friends of good govehHIMtf^fa
in this city asked Judge W. S. Har
mon in circuit court to permit Attor
neys W. S. Meredith. John W2 Mason !
and Harry Shaw ui rcprasoTOtaxpay

case was heard on the question of con
stitutionality with no one but Attorney' ;

to represent the Repubicans |ot;
city, and adverse decision being ren
dered.
It was on the petition-of the Re^Qb^
licans asking to be represented Of 2
counsel at the trial that the appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court six months
age.
When the supreme court met last
