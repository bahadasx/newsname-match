An enthusiastic meeting oi
progressive farmers and live
stock men and women was helc

ne68. As a result of the iustruc
tive addresses, the inquiries and
deliberations, a creamery foi

the State demonstration agent,
the meeting was addressed by
his representative, Mr. Hall,
who told about the establishment
of creameries in other
places, their methods of organizing
and success. He advised the
immediate establishment of
cream routes and the shipping
of the cream to the Darlington
creamery. In the meantime the
surrounding country should be
organized, farmers induced to increase
the number of cows kept,
to improve the grade; and in the
fall they could successfully establish
their own creamery. At
least, dOO cows would be required
to make it a sucess, and a capita!
of not more than $.">,01)0. including
plant.
8. C. Evans, the demonstration
agent of Marlboro county,
was lliere to urge the establishment
of a creamery, and promis
eu tnree ana perhaps lour cream
routes iti upper Marlboro, with50
to 0<) cows to the route. He show
ed that income from the cream
would support the cows, ami
that the sweet milk that would
be left, besides having what
was wanted for family use,
would feed poultry and hogs.
The four cooperative creameries
now in the State make about
50,000 pounds of butter each
month. Farmers get 82 cents a
pound for their butter fat, and
pay 2 cents a pound at the highest,
often less, to the route
agent tor collecting it. lie stressed
the need of diversifying, athe
bo'l weevi! would he with
us- in live yeais, ami now the
necessary steps to "prepared

ton acrei-.ge should ho cut (iosvn,
feed crops planted, live stock
kept ami the march o' the weevil
would not only be stopped,
but the soil would be enriched
and each farmer would have his
own fertilizer factory.
T. S. Evans, a Cheraw boy,
Clemson graduate, i;nd now the
industrial agent of the Seaboard
railroad, was present and urged
the keeping of live stock not only
to cut down the high cost of
living, but to cut down fertilizer
bills; and the building of silos,
lie stated (hat Ciarnsnn college
has plans and specifications for
building an inexpensive s?ilo,
which will be given to any one
for the asking.
A com m itee, with Mr. Mat lieson
us chairman, was appointed
to canvass this county and up
Marlboro for the necessaiy
number of cows and the establishment
of cream routes. The
chairman appointed John Hickson

W. W Long will he expected a
this meeting to give advice ii
the matter.
A canvass of the meeting rt
suited in the pledging of 80 cow
by those present. Every on
present, left feeling that a cearn
ery was alreadv an assured thing,
and that only the details remaii
ed to be worked out.
It is the intention to organiz
creamery routes running int
Chesterfield, where cream ea
be collected and shipped to th
central station at Oheraw. A
those intei^sted in this territor
should see Mr. W. A. Douglass,
Mr. Will S. Jackson.
Mr. W. S. Jackson died in ' heraw
last Sunday night and was
buried Monday. He was about
00 years of age.
Okl-timers will remember Mr.
Jackson as at one time one of the
most prominent and highly respected
citizens of the county.
He served his county as representative
in the Legislature and
as couuty treasurer. He had a
prosperous business lin Cheraw,
but lost his wealth soon after
suffering a stroke of paralysis
twenty years ago. In hfs palmy
days he owned a race horse that
was the talk of the country. His
death removed a good man who
had served his people faithfully.

Mrs. Rebecca T. Evans, widow)
of the late Oapt. Robert Evans,
died ut her home near town last
Thursday and was buried at the
Evans' family burying ground on
Friday, the funeral services being
conducted by the Rev. J. L.

Mrs. Evans was 70 years old,

The Political Pot
7 Last week was notable in the
local political field for tho number
of new mouncements and
I for the importance of tho ollices
j represented in the list. There
. were twelve new candidates to
enter the race last week.
I Unique among them is th
card for Donald S. Matheson.
, This card was presented by the
- friends of Mr. Matheson in the
i hope that he would make the
i race. Iiumor has it that he has
declined to run.
Though this paper has announced
its policy of "hands oil "
among local candidates, it seems
necessary to violate that policy
and say a few words right here,
j The editor is not acquainted
with Mr. Matheson ami therefore
'can have no personal preference
| in the matter.
It is very important that we
j send the best man to Columbia
that can possibly be supplied to
the place. At the last session
Chesterfield had probably the
strongest delegation in the
State. Every ell'ort should be
made to maintain this high
standard of service. It is buHicient
that the county seems united
011 this proposition and tl is
unity also centers 011 the man
Matheson.
W e have so far heard only one
reason advanced why he should
not run?he i;? a busy man. This
is also a reason why he should
: accept. An idle man just now
is not wanted.
If what we hear is true, Chesterfield
County has been good to
Mr. Matheson. As a lawyer, his
unusal ability was appreciated;
for his righteous churucter and
up-rightne-s of conduct in legal
practice he has been revered,
j When Ins health failed and lie
| retired to his farm, the sympathy
and love of a whole county
went with him.# Now that his
health has apparently returned,
a united county looks to him,
asking u service. This service
'cannot be rendered without sacrihee.
This sacrifice is demand
ed?we believe justly demand# 1.
Mr. Matheson being a just m
will surely make his airaiq
merits accordingly and perform
this service lor his county.
Mr. M. S. Watson last week
announced for the ollice of
Treasurer. Mr. Watson's qualifications
are well know, lie is
one of the universally liked men
and will poll a good vote.
The office of Sheriff' entered
the list with a vengence when
Messrs. Douglass and Ingram
began their duel to the death,
so far as this office is concerned.

I lass will be a bard man to beat, j
I lie has served a number years j
in this (?dice and has served well. I
He is also a popular man.
Mr. Douglass is-opposed by j
the strongest man in the county. {
It is said that Mr. Ingram, in
temperament and disposition is
1 not unlike the present Sheriff.
He also is admittedly a capable
' man. It is apparently a well
matched race. In Chora w the
' other day a polical forecaster
was hear d t o say that j
r "Ingram will beat Douglass 8 to
* 1." Another man, apparently
as' well informed, on hearing
. this, said. "I'd like to take his
1 money on that proposition, and
, I'm willing to reverse the order
s and bet that Douglass will beat
> Ingram by 8 to 1." It will, to
. nay ine least, ue an interesting
s race.
Another interesting race is
t that for Clerk of Court. Mr. I.
11 P. M&ngum the present incum
. bent, lias made good, as an nfli!
cer and us a man. lie has many
s I friends and few, if any enimies.
11 He is opposed by Mr. W. I*.

and most popular citzens. Ihis
race, also is being watched with
;e intense interest.

This is tiie first big get-together

at the same time.
There are about thirty boys in
these clubs.
This is an opportunity for
Chesteelield again to do the
riglit. thing. It will be necessary
for the good people of the
town to provide homes for these

having the course here is $25.00.
