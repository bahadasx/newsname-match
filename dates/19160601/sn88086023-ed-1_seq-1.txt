OOLUMBU3, (Jhlo, June I. (U. P
Secretary of War Baker, In what wan
regarded ns an indication of the trend
of democratic national platform, this
afternoon gave the democratic party
a clean bill of health In past, present
and prospective legislation and poll
'las, in Ma keynote speech at the Ohio
at at convention, j
A united democracy, backed bv
fonr yearn of accomplishment culml
natlag In the successful submarine ne
gotiations and faced by a fog divided
into three sections the tariff men. I
in forces of "the Ureal Detractor,"
ana peace at any price men wai
viewed by Baker. He mentioned For!
as the chosen temporary leader of the
peace men He didn't mention any
other politicians by name; and he
saved his praise for the president
aa the center of the storm.
Baker emphasized results following
passage or me ieuerai reserve act uu
der the rural credits bill. The unpre
cedented deposits of national banks.
the direct election of senators, the fed -
oral trade commission, already effect-
ed; and the prospective shipping and
child labor laws were urged as demo -
cratlc accomplishments. Of President
WUaon, he said:
"He has been the one sane and ss-
rtne spirit which will redeem this;
and when the election cornea. It
will be found that tne people of Am
erica, whatever their sympathies in
the European struggle, realise that
th one Indlspenaabre exponent of the
mind, the friendliness and the ideaU
of America In the re-making of the
oh) order in the old world, is the fin
est type produced In this age by the
now order in the new world Wood
row Wilson."
The republicans. Raker said, are
hopelessly divided. Tariff will be tho
issue. Baker said, if Senator Harding.
hcduled to preside at Chicago, Is
orrect. It will be the foreign policy
with other republicans, he argued.
"This party is again sub-divided In
to those who think the foreign policv
has been too peace-loving," he con
timed "And then there Is a lucid
group," he added, "led by the great
detractor, who. shifting from position
to position, selects at each time ap
parently whatever vantage point seems
to offer and opportunity for making
difficult the position of the president
and congress. The motive of this
group seems to be critical rather than
constructive and guided by selfish am
bition. It Ignores consistency and duty
alike, agitating that we should stay
oat when the tension of eventa seem
likely to draw ua In, and that we
should go in when such recognition of
our rights have been secured as en
able us with dignity and honor to stay
out."
Baker gave the democrats a clean
Mil of health In the preparedness mat
tar. They hare prepared the country,
he said, and have done precisely what
was necessary.

The proof of the pudding is in the
eating, sayeth the old adage, and
likewise the righteousness of a law Is
best determined by its enforcement.
The city dads discovered this when
they hired a man to enforce the traf
fic ordinance. He enforced It so lit
erally and entirely that the council
discovered that the ordinance was
working for Injustice rather than for
the peace, health and safety of the
community, anil, therefore, last night
decided to revise it materially and to
remit certain of the fines collected
for violations of Its tetter
Two thirds of the arrests made by
Traffic Officer Ray HcCalTOll have

the council were unanimous last even

of the ordinance was to prevent" the
parking of cars on the wrong side of
the street within the congested dis

the enforcement of the ordinance, as
secured by the traffic officer, was an
outrage. The violations Were technical
he said, hut, under the ordinance, he
had no option but to levy the fines
when pleas of guilty were made. City
Attorney Fee also declared the ordi

Swartzlander is
Pleased Over the
Court's Decision
INDIAN LAND IRRIGATED W1IJ,

.... uvii
Ona Of the most pleased men over
the decision of Judge Phelps In the
Indian irrigation case is Major
Swartzlander. agent upon the reser
vation, who has long contended for
the establishment of the Indian
rights.
"Indian land that may be Irrigated
will generally brine double the rent
j otherwise paid." said the major. "Con
sequently it Is for the Indian's wel
fare to have the Irrigation rights es
tablished. It will also mean consid
erable development ami settlement
between Pendleton and Gibbon. In
the neighborhood of 6000 acres of
land may be wutered from the river
and nt present only 600 or 700 acres
is being irrigated.
"If the (jtdlai rights are definitely
established I think the policy of the
government will he to make long
leases, say for 10 years, so as to per
mit of developing the land. A tenant
cannot afford to do this work on a
short lease. If the lnnd Is developed
and watered there will he room for
hundred! Of homes along the river.
Some men are now fanning on this
basil and making money nt It."
Major Swarflander was In Port
land w hen he heard of the Phelps de
cision and says Mr. Rankin, chief
ili PUt t'nlted States attornev. who
conducted the case for the govern-1
ment. Is highly pleased. He snys the i
government will appeal If nt any point 1
the Indian rights have not been fill-1
ly upheld. It Is also anticipated the
mill company will appeal so thut the
case may have to go to the I'nlted

DUBLAN, Mexico. June 1.
The conference between Pershing
and Gavira pened today in Ga
vin's private car, sidetracked on
a neutral strip midway between
the Mexican and Uu- American
CnnipH. Ouly the generals, chiefs
of staff and an interpretor were
present.
WASHINGTON. June 1. Ameri
can troops will not withdraw from
Mexico at Carranza's request. Instead
the administration will inform Car
rattta of the rejection of the request
and call attention to misstatements ot
facts about the Mexican situation.
The note will deny Carranza's claim
thut Mexico did not know about Am
ericans crossing the boundary until
days after the Villa hunt was started.
It will declare that Scott and Obre
gon did not agree not to send a sec
ord expedition after the Boquillas
raiders. It will doubtless insinuate
that the Carranzistas did not cooper
ate, else Longhorne's expedition would
have encountered patrols during the
drive south of Big Bend.
The president's absence tomorrow
will delay consideration of the note
until Tuesday.
Funston issued a statement at San
Antonio today declaring that no
agreement ever had been reached at
the Scott -Obregon conferences.

PITT.SnunG, June 1 Roosevelt re
iterated emphatically today he will
not go to Chicago. He stopped a few
minutes here en route to New York.
CHICAGO, June I. George Per
kins brought the olive branch to the
G. O. P. again today. The bull moose
chieftain greeted Chairman Hilles and
then announced flatly that the pro
gressives will support any candidate,
not necessarily Roosevelt, who sup
ports the progressive principles He
decried reports of a bitter feeling be
tween the camps of different candi
dates. Hilles said he believed that
the progressives ana republicans will
get together.
Presidential boomers hovered about
the Alabama delegation today like
flies over syrup. Any man with a
southern accent who said he was from
Alabama had politicians at his heels
with promises of a brilliant future and
fat cigars. The Alabama delegation
is still on the fence, although Hughes
supporters claimed tnem. Alabama is
first on the roll call with a fine op
portunity to start something.
Perkins said: "I read that Car-
ranza has accused the Wilson adminis
tration of duplicity and of misleading
the Mexican government. It occurs to
me that this is the first time a foreign
power ever dared to accuse the United
States of treachery. The prime object
should be to stop this sort of thing and
restore our good name."
Perkins shook hands with Hilles,
Smoot and others.
Republican, democratic, progressive
and prohibition parties are ready to
bid for the support of the women's

Other speakers are Gifford Pinchot,
