ARMED RESISTANCE
Threatened Itj Cnrrnnzn In United
Slate Does Xot Withdraw Troops
Com in u n lent In ii Is Not
I'ltliiinliiin.
Washington, May !U General Cnr
raiuas lutest note, bluntly question
ing tho Rood fnltli of the t'nlted States
government and with a threat of armed
resistance, demanding withdrawal of
tho Aemlrcnn troops from Mexico, was
presented nt tho Stntc Department to
day by Kllsco ArrolRnatc. Tonight a
translation of tho valuminous docu
ment about 1,200 words long, was laid
before President Wilson, who at once
began considering how It should bo an
swered. No one In offlclal circles would at
tempt to forecast Just what course the
President might decide. There was
complete unanimity In the belief that
there would bo no Immediate with
drawal of tho Perishing expedition.
High mllltnry officials said the defacto
government had utterly failed to dem
onstrate Its ability to protect tho hor
dcr agalnRt bandits, nnd expressed tho
opinion that the troops would stay
In Mexico until this was (lone.
It was suggested that tho bolllger
ent and uncompromising tone assumed
by Carranza probably was largely for
effect upon tho eMxIcan public, nnd
thcro was llttlo disposition to bollovo
that tho do facto government actually
contemplated an effort to expel tho
American army by force.
Mr. Arrcndondo loft the Impression
that his chief did not expect tho do
flant words of the note to bo taken
tho communication to actlnc Secre
tary Polk ho gave notice that It was
not Intended as an ultimatum, but aB
n continuation of tho negotiations
which havo been In progress between
tho two governments.
The new note, written before the
withdrawal of the American troops
which entered Mexico after tho Bo
qulllas raid, was brought to Washing
ton Monday by Manuel Mondez, nn at
tache of the Mexican foreign office.
