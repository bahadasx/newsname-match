The Coyote
The Junior class of the high school
has published an elaborate high
school annual of 160 pages the volume
having been received from the print
ers this week. It is a very neat piece
of work and shows that the staf of
editors and artists of the Coyote have
given much time and labor in com
piling the book, and no doubt they
have also received hearty .-support
from the individual members of the
high school classes and the faculty
in producing the publication.

CHARGES AGAINST HOVDE
AT STANLEY DIDN'T HOLD
Charges brought against P. L.

last week.
WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 1916.
St. Paul, May 29.—James J. Hill,
the most widely known figure of the
northwest, died at his Summit avenue
residence at 9:30 o'clock this morning
as the result of an infection develop
ing from bowel trouble. Hill was un
conscious for nearly twelve hours be
fore he died.
Dr. Herman M. Biggs of New York,
and Dr. Stanley Seager of the Mayo
staff, and all the members of his fam
ily were at the bedside with the ex
ception of Mrs. Anson M. Beard, of
New York, a daughter. She is ex
pected to arrive tonight. James N.
Hill, of New York, and Mrs. Samuel
Hill, of Washington, arrived by regu
lar trains over the Burlington rail
road early in the morning. They
were met at the station by George T.
Slade, a son-in-law, and taken imme
diately to the Hill home.
The funeral was private and was
conducted from the residence at 2
p. m. Wednesday, it was decided at a
conference of sons and daughters late
today at the home of Louis W. Hill.
No one was expected to attend save
friends of the family, business asso
ciates and employees of the Great
Northern road. The body was taken
directly to North Oakes, the Hill
farm, for interment. A Mauso
leum to cover the grave will be erect
ed later. Rev. Father Thomas J.
Gibbons conducted the services.
will make such a governor as the
state needs at this time—a man who
has the confidence of all the people of
the state regardless of faction, party,
ir occupation. Burdick is a man of
unusual ability, unquestioned integ
rity, broad guaged, vigorous. He has
been one of the leaders in the move
ment for better government in North
Dakota and stands for those things
in state government for which the
rank and file have so long been fight
ing. He has served the people of the
state with distinction, first as speaker
of the house and then as lieutenant
governor, and his record in these two
offices is ample proof that he is square
and able. North Dakota politics are
more or less a game of reactionism
on the one hand and sensationalism
on the other, and this swings the good
people of the state like a pendulum
from one extreme to the other. This
in the very nature of things cannot
bring about good government. The
election of Burdick would mean an ad
ministration in keeping with the real
desires of the people of the state as a
whole. It would pull the state out of
the mire of political extremes and
make way for-good progressive con
structive legislation.
MEMORIAL DAY OBSERVED
Beautiful weather on Memorial Day
greatly assisted in the success of the
program that had been mapped out
by those in charge of the exercises
and the attendance at the Armory was
very large. At the close of the pro
gram the procession formed at the
armory and proceeded to the ceme
tery where the graves of the soldier
dead were decorated.
The procession of several hundred
little children, each carrying a flag,
was a very pretty spectacle. Lack of
space precludes a more complete men
tion of the excellent program.
JAMES HILL DIES AT HIS
HOME AFTER BRIEF ILLNESS
End Came To Northwest's Most Widely Known
Citizen At 9:30 Wednesday Morning Follow
ing Operation.
(Continued on page 4)
Great Northern offices and shops
will be closed during Wednesday af
ternoon, and during the funeral serv
ices every train on the system will
stop simultaniously for five minutes.
In" Williston Pres. Craven of the
city commission issued a notice re
questing all business places to close
from 2 to 4 p. m. Wednesday after
noon out of respect to the Empire
Builder.
Hill's Last Visit to Williston
As far as can be recalled the last
visit of the Empire Builder to Willis
ton was on Jim Hill Day in the winter
of 1911-12 when the venerable gentle
man spent the day here and delivered
an address in the old Gates' audi
torium before what is said to have
been the largest audience that ever
assembled for a similar occasion in
the city. Many will recall terse bits
of his speech at that time, and one of
his remarks was to the effect that at
the time he anounced his plans to con
tinue the Great Northern west from
Minot and friends counceled him that
it was a foolish thing to do as the
country west of Minot would never
be anything more than a goat pasture.
But Hill could not be influenced by the
casual opinions of others he could
see far into the future and perhaps
pictured in his mind this country de
veloping into the splendid country
that it is today.
AN ESTIMATE OF U. L. BURDICK
FROM SOUTHWEST PART OF STATE
Adam* County Record, Hettinger
Generally speaking, the Record
does not get excited over state poli
tics and despite the turmoil that exists
in the various camps this year we
still see no reason for excitement. In
fact to our mind this is the very time
to weigh things carefully and make
deliberate decisions. Out of the maze
of movements, manipulations, fac
tions, agitation, unrest, charges and
counter charges, one fact seems to
stand out clearly, and that is that the. NEW OUTFIT FOR GREAT

OPPORTUNES TAKE THREE OF
THE SIX GAMES PLAYED—
MINOT NEXT
Williston has a real baseball crew.
There's no doubt about it.
After taking two of the three
games with Glendive's fast bunch on
the local field they went to the Mon
tana city and played the cow punch
ers to a standstill, losing the first
game and by one run after battling
along for eleven innings.
The next game of the series was
taken in decisive style, Williston get
ting six runs to Glendive's three.
Monday's game with Glendive was
lost. The final score being 2 to 4.
Immings was quite seriously hurt in
the seventh and was obliged to quit
the game, which at that time was a
tie. The impression among our fans
was that the Opportunes would have
won the last game had it not been
for the injury of Immings, who got
"spiked" in a close play.
The manager of the Opportunes had
made partial arrangements to play at
Beach before returning home this
week, but on account of rain and the
injury of one of his men Mr. Marshall
may decide not to visit Beach.
Among those who autoed to Glen
dive for the Sunday games were the
following: Geo. and Ed Buhler, Mr.
and Mrs. Burke, J. J. Murphy, Mr.
Purdy, W. J. Kelly and wife accom
panied by Mr. and Mrs. M. A. Hegge
and wife, members of the Bruegger
family, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur O'Dell
and daughter and Miss Bertha Math
ews, Mrs. Mathews, and Mrs. Bertie
Anderson.
Minot Here Next Saturday
From the viewpoint of the average
Williston fan the schedule with Minot
will be exceedingly interesting and no
doubt there is a modest desire on the
part of most of them to han the
Magicians two nice good-eggs as
tokens of their visity to this city.
The series of two games will com
mence Saturday evening, June 3.
The Saturday game will be called
at the usual hour of 6:30 and on Sun
day at 2:45.
Plentywood June 6, 7, 8

PROGRAM FOR RECEPTION OP
CIVIC & COMMERCE BODY
IS COMPLETED
With all plans complete, and a min

Minneapolis regarding the coming of
the Fifth Annual Trade Tour of the
Minneapolis Civic & Commerce Asso
ciation to Williston on Tuesday, Juna
6th. The party will arrive at 6:40
P. M., stopping all night.
According to the announcement
from Minneapolis this promises not
only to be the most successful excur
sion of its kind ever conducted from
that city but the most pleasurable as
well. The business interests of Min^
neapolis are keenly interested in th*
development of the territory to the
west, and a desire to view the re
markable forward strides of North.
Dakota and Montana during the past
five years has operated to attract &
considerable number of bank, invest
ment and other financial men to the
party in addition to the manufac
turers, wholesalers and others- en*
gaged in mercantile lines generally
participating in these excursions^
The visit of the Minneapolitans pre
sents an opportunity to every com*
munity includes in its itinerary. The
visitoi-s will be impressed not only, by
the material evidences of growth but
by the numbers and enthusiasm of the
people who join in the greeting giveib
them. The excursion will be accom
panied by Rossiter's First Regiment
Band, one of the famous military
musical organizations of the country.
Several souvenirs will be distributed
among the children and there will be
other souvenirs for some of the elders.
Every resident of the city and as
many farmers as can come in, are
both invited and urged to partitipate
in welcoming the visitors, since it is
important that this community make
a lasting impression upon them.
