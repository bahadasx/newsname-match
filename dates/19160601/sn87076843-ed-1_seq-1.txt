In the year 1832 Jarvis SpafTord
built a hotel in Perrysburg, Ohio. It
was a fine hotel in those days, al
though it would be considered a very
mediocre affair at present. In order
to hnve everything complete and first
class, ho decided to have a bell on the
house, or convenient theroto. Bell
foundries were then very rare in the
United States, but Mr. SpafFord
learned of a bcllsmith, as they were
then called, in Detroit, Michigan Ter
ritory, and' made the journey on horse
back, as it was prior to the advent of
railroads in the northwest. At Detroit
he met Samuel Davis, with whom he
contracted for a bell, and for the want
of suitable material to make the bell
as large as he desired, Mr. SpafTord
put into the composition thirty-six
Spanish dollars. In bold relief on the
exterior of the bell appear the words:
"S. Davis, Detroit, M. T., 1834." Mr.
SpafFord returned with his bell to Per
rysburg, Wood County, Ohio, and it
was a great curiosity in that new
country, especially so to the Indians,
who were very numerous in the Mau
mee Valley. Mr. SpafTord had the bell
hung up in a tree in front of his hotel
to ring at meal time. The Indians
wduld gather about the place to hear
the bell ring, and finally became so
bold as to climb the tree and cause it
to ring at all hours of the day ana
night, to the great annoyance of Spaf
ford and his patrons. They became so
persistent in their ringing that he
was frequently compelled to use force
to drive them away. But such was
the infatuation the Indians entertained
for the bell that one night they stole
it and carried it away, following an
old trail through Bowling Green and
Findlay to Upper Sandusky, Ohio,
where they made a general redezvous
for years. When Mr. SpafFord dis
covered the loss he was greatly In
censed, and offered a liberal reward for
the capture of the thieves and the re
turn of the bell. It had cost him near
ly $100, which in those days was re
garded a handsome sum of money. He
soon discovered the trail the thieves
had taken, and at once secured the
services of an old half-breed scout
named Sam Brady, a desperate char
acer who had killed many Indians and
not a few white men in his time, and
the two, in company with Frank Hol
ister, the, first white settler In Perrys
burg, started out to recover the bell.
Holister knew many of the Indians
personally, and had slept in nearly
every wigwam on the Maumee River.
They were three days making the trip
from Perrysburg to the Sandusky
plains, camping out nights, with Brady
to pilot them through. Early on the
morning of the fourth day they heard
the familiar tinkle of the bell, and
they started a cautious trail through
the woods and deep grass toward the
point from which the sound emanated.
To their astonishment they discovered
the bell strapped to a pony, and it
being, chased round a circle formed by
the Indian men, women and children,
who were enjoying the ringing of the
bell. On being discovered the Indians
broke circle and began sneaking away.
The pony was so frightened that he
ran through the woods, and the search
ing party was unable to catch him.
As soon as they could get within range
Brady's rifle went to his shoulder, and

"ORLEANS OP THE NORTH."
Who has 'not heard of the hardy
pioneer,
That came to this region in an early
year,
When the forests of oak and maple
and beech,
Covered the land further than eye
could reach;
And the mosquitos and swamps and
swails and bogs,
Made it hard living for even wild hogs,
That lived on the acorns that fell from
the trees,
While they scratched 'gainst the logs
to bother the flees,
That had burrowed their way through
an inch of his hide,
But whose purpose was other than just
taking a ride.
Who has not heard of the hardy
pioneer,
Who lived on corn bread and drank his
whisky clear;
He would grind his ax and with songs
on his lips,
He would chop down he trees ad scat-
terthe chips,
And a very short time saw him raise
up a house,
That would serve as a mansion for him
and his spouse;
But at night when the door had been
bolted strong,
And the forest was still, but morning
long,
Then the wolves would howl, and the
wildcats yell,
I tell you, to us now, it would be one of
some other place.'
Perrysburg lost their first game
in ten innings Sunday afternoon
to the Toledo Semi-Pros 2 to 1.
The game should have went to the
locals 1 to 0 hut a misplay in the
eighth inning gave the visitors a
run and tied the score. And they
got the winning run in the tenth
on two hits and a sacrifice. Per
rysburg's only run came in the
third inning. C. Reis walked, stole
second and third, and scored on
lloffmastcr's hit.
The features were the base run
ning of C. Reis and the pitching
of McDonald, allowing five hits,
striking out 12 and did not walk a
man. Dunn had. nine hits regis
tered to his delivery, struck out
three, walked five. Both teams
played real hall and much credit
should be given better base ball.

It would almost pay one, having
the leisure and disposition, to visit
the site of old "Orleans" down on
the "Flats" below Ft. Meigs, to
see what ho might find in the way
of old relics of this ancient village.
I say "ancient" because it was
just about a century ago that it
was in its prime.
If one should, dig down deep
enough he might find the platted
remains of the little city, with its
squares and streets laid out with
mathematical precision. IIo might
possibly run on the old "Field
Notes" of Seneca Allen who in an
early day surveyed the place; or
perhaps the old "Log Book" of
the "Walk in the Water," the first
famous steamboat of tho Lakes
that used to make the place regu
larly and which was owned and
commanded by Capt. J. B. Stew
art. And other relies, who knows,
what might be found? I say it
might pay one having the leisure,
a long spade and an abundance of
patience!
After Ft. Meigs was abandoned
in 1814, Major Amos Spafford to
gether with John Carter and. John
Race, returned to tho Jtapids of
tho Maumee.
They found the country around
in a most desolate condition. Spaf
ford, before the war, had been post
master and collector of customs
here at the "Port of Miami." At
the time he returned, Lieut. Ahnon
Gibbs, with- forty soldiers, were
yet at the Fort. These were soon
uisenargeu and uibbs, who was
then appointed postmaster, carried
that oll'ieo across tho river. The
returning sottlers at once set about
to rebuild tho demolished cabins
and reclear their abandoned farms.
Carter and Race were both killed
by the Indians who were not yet
to be trusted, as was also Levi
Hull, who lost his life on the pres
ent sito of where our M. E. church
stands. Until their cabins were
completed, many lived in tho old
Block Houses of tho Fort and sev
eral of our oldest pioneers were
born there. Mosquitos were ram
pant and "Chill Fever" or what
we now call malaria fever, was the
principal malady.
Not a few died of this disease
and somo loft on account of not bo

On Tuesday afternoon at about
2 o'clock Ed. Ziglcr aged 35, Ed.
Uhlrich, his brother-in-law, aged
32, and Ziglers boy about 10
years of age, were crossing the
Ohio Electric tracks at the Dutch
road crossing west of Maumee, the
auto was struck by an electric car
and demolished.
Zigler and Uhlrich were dead
when help arrived and the bov
was seriously bruised, but will
live.
Witzlcrs ambulance was called
and conveyed tho bodies to Zig
lcr's home west of Maumee.

"THE MAN WHO CAN WIN."
Thomas W. Latham.
"Hats are off" among Republl
cans in Huron County for the nonv
ination of Tom Latham for Con
gress. From all sections of the
13th district conies news of tho
friendly feeling for Huron's can
didate. He looks like a sure win
ner. The Republican organization
of the county, with the rank and
file of the party stands behind him
solid as a rock. No time in the
history of the country will our rep
resentatives at Washington be
called upon to assist in the enact
ment of legislation that will serve
as a signal light for the generation
following as in the coming year
1917. It is such men as Mr. Lath
am who by their own efforts have
made their busiuess a success, and
as a result thereof can make law
making a success, that should rep
resent us. We want today the
business man in politics more than
over. Without further comment
Thonlas W. Latham goes before
the Republicans of Erie, Huron,
Sandusky, Seneca and Wood, as a
candidate for the nomination of
representative. lie is a big earnest
and capable man of affairs, emi
nently fitted to represent yoti.

walk Reflector Herald. Adv.
The class address was delivered
by Prof. Nietz, Supt. of the Per
rysburg village schools. His
speech was inspirational and made
a splendid impression on the au
dience and the pupils. He re
ferred to the possibilities of the
youth who aspired to higher aims;
who placed his mark at a high
point and earnestly worked to
reach the mark. We regret that
space forbids giving the complete
address, as it was well worthy
publication.
The commencement was a great
sucess and spoke well for the con
dition of the township schools.

Passing of Samuel Butler.
On Friday, May 20, 1910, Mr?
Samuel Butler, died at his home
in Perrysburg at the age of 82
years.
Mr. Butler was born in slavery
and resided on his master's plan
tation near Lexington, Ky.
During the war he became a
personal servant for Gen. Slevin
who brought him to Perrysburg
after the close of the Rebellion,
and he has continued to reside
here, where he has been known as
an honorable citizen and has been
respected by all who knew him.
His wife preceded him many
years ago. Two sons and two
daughters survive him.
His funeral was conducted by
Rev. Vandersall on Sunday and the
remains interred in Ft. Meigs
