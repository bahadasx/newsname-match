FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH MORE
THAN KEEPING PACE WITH
PROGRESS OF CITY ACCOM
PLISHMENTS OUTLINED.
One of the institutions of this city
which is more than keeping pace
with the progress of Ardmore is the
First Christian church. During the
past eight months this church has
had nn increase in membership of
fifty per cent and during the same
period tlu increase of attendance at
the Sunday school has been thirty
five per cent. The congregations at
the preaching services have grown In
number until the auditorium is filled
at almost every service.
During this time the church has
kept all its current expenses paid
nnd has raised in cash $2,500 besides
and no special campaign has been
inaugurated to raise the additional
money. The church is in a healthy
growing condition and the member
ship is generous and money comes
spontaneously.
The church is planning in the early
future, probably during this month,
to make the purchase of a pipe or
gan. The interest being manifested is
demonstrated by the fact that ten
members were baptized . Into the
church on Wednesday night a week
ago, and on last night the ordinance
of baptism was administered to
others.
The Sunday school is one of the
few that has been perfectly graded
and is doing a fine class of work.
The services next Sunday will be
of a peculiar interest. Lunches will
be brought by all attendants at the
Sunday morning service and a fine
dinner will be spread in the base
ment of the building. A notice in
this paper signed by the pastor, Dr.
J. W. Burns, gives an outline of the
Sunday all day services.

CARTER
IS
MEETING HELD WEDNESDAY AT
BERWYN GROWTH IS RE
MARKABLE SESSION MAR
MONIOUS.
The
session of the Carter County
ellows' association, held Wed
Odd F
nesday in Benvyn, was a memorable
event in the annals of the order in
southern Oklahoma, and showed con
clusively what a united fraternity
can accomplish.
Within the brief space of one year
the association, which had its incep
tion in Ardmore witli the aid of a
few .surrounding lodges, has extend
eu its boundaries until toibiv Is
nn mtiersiiip embraces the counties of
i.ove ami jonnsion anu wisttul eyes
look on from the a era cent counties
of Stephens, Jefferson, Murray am
-warsnan. .Many members or t lie or
tier are just beginning to reeognit
the merits and objects of t he ns.so
elation.
The open session of the lterwyn
meeting was held in the auditorium
of the school building, a neat, hand
some and substantial structure lo
cated on top of the hill at the out
skirts of the town, a building that
for neatness of construction in the
interior is not surpassed by any
school building in the state, and this
includes some of much greater pre
tensions. Here an excellent program
of music and oratory was enjoyed for
a couple of hours, and it may be said
right here that the young ladies of
Kerwyn are skillful artists and enter
tainers.
Dinner was served at six o'clock,
and such a feast! Tables loaded
with choicest viands to tickle the
palate ot the most fastidious, pre
sented a sight altogether too tempt
ing of description. Suffice to say
that the two hundred Odd Fellows,
after partaking of the feast, declared
that llerwyn ladies were entitled to
the blue ribbon, for on no former
meeting of the association had such
an elaborate and well spread feast
been laid for them. Too much can
not be said for the ladies of the
little city in catering to the Odd
Fellows and their genuine hospitality
showered by the entire citizenship of
the town, speaks volumes for the
harmonious and friendly rivalry to
please the strangers within their
gates, ladies, we just love you all.
The business session of the asso
ciation was held at eight o'clock, and
showed a remarkable increase in
membership. The financial affairs of
the association, although small,
showed up splendidly, and the re
ports of the officers showed that we
had entered a successful and har
monious era. The committee re
ports also contained flattering reports
on the condition of the order within
our district.
Our retiring president, J. It. Talia
ferro of Lone Grove, delivered a splen
did salutatory which put enthusiasm,
push, vim and general good feeling
into every one who heard him.
The election of officers for the
year was the occasion of genuine fra
ternal rivalry which put a little snap
into the meeting. At its conclusion
it was found that the body had cho
sen:
Franklin Bourland of Ardmore, pres
ident. Brooks of Marietta, vice
president. N. E. Martin of Ardmore, secre
tary -treasurer.
Marietta was chosen as the place
for the next convention which will
be held on the last Monday in Aug
nst. As the meeting passed Into history,
It was declared the best meeting the
association had ever had.
Following the meeting of the asso
ciation, a composite team was form
ed, and without any previous drilling,
put on the work of the Initiatory and
First Degree upon candidates of the
Berwyn lodge, thus extending the
work into the wee sma" hours of a
bright June morning.
Col. A. V. Doak has gone to Dallas,
where he will have his eyes treated.

COMMANDER OF ENGLISH FOR
CES REPORTS MANY SHARP
LOCAL ENGAGEMENTS PAYS
TRIBUTE. TO FRENCH.
London, May :i I. -General Sir
Douglas llaig, commander of iho

in a dispalt h covering I lie operations
of the British army in i hat. territory
from D.-c, i!i List, when lie took
over (he command, until May I'.i.
pays high tribute to the French de
fense of Verdun and reviews in de-
tan tne actions in which the iiritis
have taken part.
"During this period," he savs, "lb
only offensive effort made by th
enemy on a great scale was directe
against our Mvneh allies near Ver
dun. The fighting in that area has
been prolonged and severe. The re
suits have been worthy of the Iradi
tions of the French army and of
great service to the cause of the
allies.
Germans Making Useless Sacrifices.
i no cnorts made by the enemy
have caused him heavy losses both
in men and in prestige and he has
made these sacrifices without gaining
any advantage to counterbalance
them.
During tins struggle my troops
have been In readiness to co-operate
as they might be needed, but the
only assistance asked for by our allies
was of an laiiirrct nature, namely
tne rener oi ine i-rencn troons on
a portion or their defensive front.
"Tliis relief I was glad to be able
to afford. Its execution on a consid
erable front everywhere in close
touch with the enemy was a some
what delicate operation, but it was
carried out with complete success,
thanks to the cordial co-operation
nnd good will of all ranks concerned
and to the lack of enterprise shown
by the enemy during the relief"
While no action comparable with
that at Verdun has been fought on
the British front, General Haig says
the British struggle has been con
tinuous and there have been many
sharp local actions. Their mainten-
nce and repair of t he trenches alone
speaks of tie continual activity of
the arti'hrv, infantry, airmen, sap
pers ami miners, and adds:
"Ever fic:-ent threats cause a more
onstant htiain than any other form
of warfare."
Desciiees Daring French Attacks.
There w.ie sixty local actions dur
ing the peiiod under review, some
of which, says General Itaig, although
individually insignificant in a war on
such an immense scale, would have
been considered worthy of a sepa
rate dispatch under different condi
tions. The British commander makes spe
cial mention of raids or "cutting out"
parties which have been made at 'east
three times against the enemy I'nes.
"They consist," he says, "of a brief
attack with some special object on
a section of the opposing trenches
and are usually carried out at night
by a small body of men. The char
acter of these operations, the prepara
tion of the road through our own and
the enemy's wire, the crossing of
open ground, the unseen penetration
of the enemy's trenches, hand-to-hand
fighting in the darkness and the
uncertainty as to the strength of the
opposing force give peculiar scope
to gallantry, dash and quickness of
decision of the troops engaged and
much skill and daring are displayed
in these operations.
"The initiative in these minor op
erations has been taken and on the
whole has been held by us, but the
Germans recently have attempted
some bold and well conceived raids
against our lines, many of which
have been driven back, although some
succeeded in penetrating."
Health of Army Good.
General Haig mentions the arrival
of the Anzacs and South Africans
and additional Canadian forces In
France and says that this made pos
sible the taking over of a greater
extent of front. He then tells of the

COMMISSIONERS ARE CONTEM
PLATING MOVING THE PLANT
TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
LAKE NEAR THE DAM.
The city officials are contemplating
moving the pumping plant at the city
lake from its present location to the
north side of the lake near the dam,
and yesterday H. E. Elrod an engineer
from Dallas, Texas, who is an expert
in this line of w;ork, was here con
sulting with the city commissioners
relative to doing the work.
iSince the dam was raised it has
thrown the present pumping plant be
low the surface of the water level
and there is danger that It may be
inundated, which was very narrowly
averted this spring. For that reason
the mayor and commissioners deem It
advisable to move the plant to the
opposite side of the lake where there
would be no possibility of Its ever ibe-
conilng flooded. Mr. Elrod has made
a thorough Inspection of the plant and
has made recommendations to the city
commissioners relative to the contem
plated change. The matter will prob-
ibly be taken up by the commission
ers relative to the contemplated
change. The matter will probably ibe
iken up by the commissioners at the
next regular meeting.

school in that city and has taken de
grees this year that entitle him to
