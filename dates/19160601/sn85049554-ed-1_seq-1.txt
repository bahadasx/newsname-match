CARRANZA BAY8 BROKEN FAITH.
Holds Mexioo Never Gave Consent to
l', Entranoe of Amerioana.
t'.M* Mexico City, June 1.—Claiming that
the words and protests of the United
States have been entirely in contradic
tion of their acts and that in spite of
promises not ts Intervene in the affairs
of Mexico soldiers of the United States
are In Mexico without the consent of
the Mexican government and in viola
tion of Mexico's sovereignty, the Mexi
can government now asks for the-Im
mediate withdrawal of those troops.
The entrance of the American expe
dition after, the Glenn Springs raid,
the note declares, "places In grave dan
ger the harmony and good relations
which ought to exist between the gov
ernments of the United States and
Mexico."
Mexico Didn't Consent.
The note tecites that the American
troops crossed the border after the Co
lumbus incident without permission of
the Mexican government The act was
not considered one of invasion then
solely because Che United States said
they had misinterpreted the attitude of
the Mexican government.
When the second expedition crossed
(he line after the Glenn Springs in
cident, the note maintains, the plea
that this was done with the consent of
the Mexican consul ai Dei ^tio, Tex..
Is untenable, and that act can only be
considered 4s one of invasion.
"The Mexican government, therefore,
Invites the United States to bring an
end to this unaupportable situation,"
note concludes, "and to support its
protestations and declarations of
friendship by an immediate withdraw
al of American troops."
Tjirie to State
N
Cmtm.
Maintaining that the protests of
friendship by the United States and
the expressed desire for noninterven*
tloB have been contradicted bby acts
of the Washington government, the
hife says the time has arrived when
Vteibiajtioa must declare itself clearly
'l:
and unequivocally aa to its future In
tentions toward' Mexico.
After reciting the facts which led
g$o the first crossing of the frontier by
the American troops after the Villa
raid at Columbus, the note insists that
in contradiction of the word of Gen.
Scott add Gen. Funston, other expedi
tions crossed the boundary ^ne, thus
violating all the precepts of, interna
tional law andVoommitting an act of
invasion.
Work Don*—Army Stays.
"The American government," says
the note, "has admitted that the
work of, the expedition which entered
after the Columbus raid is now over.
But in spite of this fact, American
troops still remain on Mexican soil.
To contend that political disorder in
this country justifies this act of the
American military forces is in conflict
with th? professions of tvio
Washington government relative to
noninterference
The note points out that much of the
trouMe in Mexico* is due "to the atti
tude of the "United States in not pun
ishing conspirators in the United
States who have plotted the downfall
of the present constitutionalist govern
ment, apd to the acts of Washington
in refusing to permit the shipment of
arms and ammunitions to enter Mex
ico."
'Didn't Know of Move.
Reviewing the developments after
the Columbus raid, the note says:
"The Mexican government had no
knowledge that American troops had
crossed the border until March 17, and
this came from private sourpes In El
Paso. This government then directed a
note to the American government stat
ing that inasmuch an no formal agree
ment had been entered into between
the two governments the Americans
could not be considered as authorized
to send such an expedition."

Berlin, June 1.—James W. Gerard,
the American ambassador, had a hal£

Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, It
was learned today. The Immediate oc
casion for the conference was the
question of Polish relief but the chan

cussed topics of more general interest.
Prof. iHans Delbrueck, of the Uni

in the war in which he says there is
something repellant to Germany In the
Idea of accepting President Wilson as
mediator. It is obvious, he says, that
the sympathies of the president are
with the entente allies. He continued:
'^Moreover, President Wilson, by
