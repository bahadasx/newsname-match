Everyone asks this question many
times daily.
We are all dependent upon the: time.
Our lives are regulated by our,
watches;
The lack of a watch is a big handi
cap to both men and women.
Therefore, why try to get along
without one?
Let us show you a good watch; one
you can depend upon. We can suit
both your taste and your pocketbook.

Our customers perhaps could notunder
stand why they have to pay more for our
asparagus now. A dollar is a dollar with us
whether it changes hands in Hood River or
comes from aa outside market; in. fact, war
believe the interest of the commuaityift
better served by bringing more money into it
and should we not favor theoutakk market
oo that account, but whes so much stronger
is other cities; it becomes oar doty as pro
gressive growers to take' advantage of it
and. Hood River merchants and consumers
should be only to glad that our Non Pareil
Vegetables are appreciated away from homa
That's the reason Non ' Pareil Asparagus.;

Saprene. Court JUmandt Case U WiUi
Board loterested' Concern
Miy Now Beconw Pfftiw
According to Geo. R. Wilbur, attor
nsyfaod secretary ot tba irrigation die.
tnct. the decision last Tuesday ot the
supremo court in reversing and remand
ing, for a hearing before thai State
Water Board the case of the Oregon.
umeer umpany vs.i ua East cork
Irrigation District, marks.. the initial
itep in, the water tight litigation that
will overshadow anyjimilar case aver
beard in Oregon.
"As 1. Interpret the decision of the
supremo court,'' ssys Mr. Wilbur, "the
ease, when it is again opened before
the State Water Board, wilt call not
merely for an adjudication of rights aa
existing between tbe Oregon Lumber
Company and the Esst Fork Irrigation
District, but for the rights, ss well, of
ail interested psrties and concerns in
the Hood river watersheds -.
"Hood River' eouncy 'a two chief In
terests, orcharding and electric power,
both dependent on-the- stream- that bi
sects the valley, will be brought face
to fact in a battle that in local' circles
will eclipse each former record casss sal
that or the willow creek controversy,
the North Powder River case- and
Hough vs. Porter, the latter involving:
a big district in- Kleraath county.
According to Mr. Wilbur's predictions,
tho following seven irrigation systems,
covering ' in t the aggregate the eetire
area" of the- freit district, will be
aligned against - the Pacifre Power A
Light Co. and the Oregon Lumber Co.,
the latter two concerns representing
water power Interests; the Glacier Ir
rigating Co.. the Ess) Pork Irrigstien
District, tbe Mount - Hood Water Co
the' MiOdle Fork Irrigating Ok, the
Deo Power A hrigatmg Co., the Heed
Rives Irrigation District and the Farrai
er's Irrigatisg Co.
The- esse ia question was taken so
the supremo court from a decision of
Circuit Judge Bradahsw ol.The Dalles,
last year. Litigation- arose when' the
district made preparations to make use
of the greater portion of 7000 incbeaof
water on the, Esst Fork of Hood river,
to which it: alleged a tight. by prior
filings. The lumber company maia
tained In ita complaint, ia seeking to
enjoin the district from the use of the
water, that such a use would hamper
it in tho operation of ita, largo electri
cally driven sawmill at N Deo. The
plaintiff company alleged that rights
of tho irrigation district, had lapsed
because of its failure to make continu
ous development of its system for the
use of the water.
Since. .litigation, began, the lumber
company - baa. installed at ita Deo-miU
at an outlay of approximately $30,000,
a steam turbino capable of furnishing
power for the lumber plant.
The East Fork District, since tbe
case was opened, has spent in bringing!
its: aisiriouuon system pracucauy 10
completion, approximately $100,009.
The system covers 13.000 acres of orch
srd land on tho east side of Hood Rivsr
volley.
"Some of the former eases mar have
involved more territory than- will be
drawn into tho case that will probably
arise." said Mr. Wilbur, 'but none or
them haa approached in tbe amount of j
property valuation involved the- sura
that will bo concerned in tho suit that;
as it seems to me, is pending. In fact
almost the entire assessed valuation of
tho Hood River valley, approaching
$10,0000,00, will bo drawn in on one or
the other of tbe two sides of tho esse."
Ernest C. Smith, attorney for the Or
egon Lumber Co., concurs in tho msin
with the interpretation- placed on the
decision of the supreme court by Mr.
Wilbur.
Testimony in the ease, if it comes on
for hearing aa predicted, will be taken
by tho State Water Board. Tbe case
will then come on again before the cir
cuit court for hearing, and it is possi
ble thst it may again go up to the su
preme court for final adjudication.
Attorney Smith, when naked lor a
statement concerning tho matter said:
"We are willina to try this case in
the courts and have been unwilling to
resort to or be quoted by the newspa
pers. Bowover, : ia. view of much that
has boon printed and th' unwarranted
inforeneea which have been attempted,
you may aay this : It must be appar
ent to anyone at all familiar with-the
case that the supreme court could have
settled all Questions between, plaintiff
and defendant by affirming Judge
Btadahaw's decision, it it had though;
that decision proper and in accordance
with the law. This could have been
done without jeopardising the righta of
other water claimants, who wiu now
appear, and it would have simplified
matters. But Judge Bradahaw's decis
ion wsa not affirmed, but it. wss re
verted in every particular-and sent
back by the supreme court with direc
tion for asv adjodieatioBr of: water
rights which will be worth while and a
good thing lor the whole valley.
COUNTY AUTO TRUCE
RAISES PROBLEM
The purchase of the new Packard
automobile truck, with which it has
been proposed to eeevey material from
West Side county sand am) gravel pits
to the Eaat Side roads, haa raited a
question snd bss renewed agitation on
tbe part of many to have the- county
take over not only tbe steel bridge
leading from State street to tbe Eaat
Side credo across Hoed rivet, but the
East Side grade and tbe boat landing
road as well. The county waa warned
against using the steel bridge tit hav
ing been said by city officiate that the
approach to the bridge might not be
able to hold the heavy loads of tbe new
road vehicle. The truck has a capacity
of three and a half varde.
It ia aaid that the city baa expanded
the aura of more than $2000 on the
steel bridge and its appreachee- since
lsst December.
"While tbe bridge and ita approaches
would stand op under ordinary -traffic
for another two years, perhaps.' aaya
City Recorder Howe, "it e thought
that the heavy traffic- imposed by the
motor track would soon cause it to go
to piecee.
It is said that the boat landing road
sad the East Side grade are used mere
aa county thoroughfares than aa city
streets
. Ceuntyv officials wae gar the new
truck a trial Monday in the Oak Grove
district, are well pleased with, it
- "We are making a trip every 40 min
otea with the inechinet aaid - Commis
sioner Hawkeay- Monday afternoon,
"and it. seams like, a mighty good in
vestmsnt to ue."

Smith, manager of the mountaie host

"The trip to Cloud Cap Inn- should
prove a deJiihtfuJ novelty for the first
six weekst after tbe heeteiry is open
ed' says Jamea Stranahan, of the
Fashion Livery Co., "for deep snow
will cover the road - from- the- first turn
out three miles from; the hotel, and this
distance will be covered with sleighs.
The snow is probably deeper on Mount
Hood's side than any season since Cloud
Cap Inn waa opened.''1
1 The Fatbion , Stablee , will feature
specisl Sunday trips to tbe Inn this
year.
"We will make a specisl rate for
parties of fives os six who desire to take

However, we will not make tbe trip
for a less number than five, that is, at

While tbe breete thst e&mo fanning
op tbe Columbia waa atill cool, but not
uacomfortable.the aun shone brilliantly
on Tueaday and conditions for local ob
servtion of - Memorial Day were excel
lent. All business houses (and banks,
ot course,) were- closed in honor of the
nation's soldier dead.
Many citisens joined with frsternsl
orgsnisationa, Canby Post, G. A. R.,
the Woman'a Relief Corpa and veterans
of the Spanish-American war in the
annul journey to Idlewilde cemetery,
where Sowers were strewn over graves
of. deported comrades. Following the
services, at the cemetery, tbe G. A. R.
veterana. Spanish Wsr veterans and
members of Canby Corpa snd their
families repaired to Chautauqua Park
for an open air picnic.
On Sunday the patriotic orgsnisa

vices at the United Brethren church,
where an appropriate sermon wss de
livered by Rev, Morris Goodrich.
Tbe scene at Chautauqua Park in tbe
open air theatre Tuesday afternoon
waa tucb aa to inspire patriotism. The
big st&ge wss decorated with wild
flowers- and rippling flags, big and lit
tle. The program . rendered waa such
as to arouse appreciation, not only of
tbe veterans grouped in a thin rank in
front rows, but to the entire assem
blage aa well. . Notes for "prepared
ness" were struck in the addresses of
Newton Clark and Geo. R. Wilbur, the
two chief speakera of the day.
''For the first time," ssid Mr. Clsrk,
"we have held our program outside of
Idlewilde cemetery. This waa occa
sioned because of the failing strength
in i the rank of us veterans. Every 30
days we are getting reports telling ua
that an average of 8,000 namea are be
ing dropped from tho honor roll. Tho
Old Brigade ia dropping off. We did
not feel equal to the task of erecting a
stage at the cemetery this year.
"You have heard of that woman who
'did not raise her boy to be a soldier.'
I don't think she is in this crowd todsy.
In 1 set, she bss msde the supreme mis
tsfce of her life in that resolution. No
greater privilege is given any man than
that of fighting for his . flag and the
righto of his country."
Mr. Clark paid thanks to the Knights
of :Py thias, the children of tbe schools
and to Prof. J.O. McLaughlin for their
services ia msking a success of tbe
day's program.
the address of Mr. Wilbur wu a '
masterly one, the spesker paying a -tribute
to Lincoln, whose life had pre-
Sarad bim to solve, even with bis
eath, tho greet problem of the civil
wsr, snd to preserve the union. The '
greet Europesn wer, Mr. Wilbur said,
haa taught America to realise tbe ne
cessity ot preparation to perpetuate
right "Let future Memorial days,"
he ssid, "be held to pay tribute not
only to grest sacrifices for country, but
to acts ot preparation to prevent sac
rifice." Other psrts of tbe program were as
follows:
Prayer, Rev. W. B. Young; singing
ofi"Ameries," school children; "The
