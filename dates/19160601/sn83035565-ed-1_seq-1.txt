Political Gossip from
Washington. .
Washington, May 31.' (Special
Correspondence.) It is every day
more evident to political obser
vers that there Is a wide differ
erica, between the Democratic
party and the Democratic lead
ers. The party is made up of in
dividuals In all the states who
have high ideals and who are de
voted to the welfare of the whole
country. The Democratic lead
ership is drawn almost entirely
from the South, and Its princi
ples are subordinated to local in
terests and temporary partisan
advantage The party has de
sired economy, efficiency, obser
vance of the merit system in "the
government service, and fulfill
ment of platform pledges. The
leadership has been willing to
disregard campaign promises, to
throw the government service in
to the old, discarded spoils sys
tem, and h?s been willing to ap
propriate public .funds for any
old purpose, just so it helped a
Democratic district. It is appar
ent that, there are enough inde
pendent Voters in the member
ship of the Democratic party to
rebuke the leaders at the polls in
November.

When thfi Democrats were nut
ting through their $50,000,000
appropriation, for flood control on
the lower reaches of the Missis
sippi river, Congressman Madden
of Illinois offered some sugges
tions that made a very favorable
impression upon both Republican
and Democratic members. He
asserted that the place to control
a flood is not on the lower part of .
a river but in the upper portions
and the tributaries, " where the
water should be confined for pow
er purposes, and let cut into 4 the
stream gradually, thus serving
the triple purpose' of furnishing
power, preventing floods in the
spring and keeping the rivers
supplied with water in the dry
seasons. But the appropriation
for the lower river went through.

Senator Norria of Nebraska, a
Progressive but in the ranks of
the Republican party, gave an a
musing account of the Democra
tic record on the Panama tolls
question, a, few days ago He
recalled the fact that ever since
the question, first came up he ad
vocated charging American ships
the same tolls as ships of other
nations. Democratic editors dV
nounced him a a "railroad sena
tor'?, and pointed to President
Wilson's campaign speech advo
cating free tolls; Wben Wilson
changed his attitude on the ques
tion, the Democratic members
changed their votes, the Demo-
cratic editors became advocates
of the very policy ,Norris had
been pursuing, but they failed to
commend him. ,
Congressman Albert Johnson
of. Washington created quite a
sensation in the House a few days
ago by asserting that he had seen
an order issued by the Secretary
of War calling for the discharge
from certain crews of all persons
not native-born citizens of the
United States. This order, said
Johnson, had already resulted in
the dismissal of five men who are
natives of Scandinavian countries
but for many years naturalized
citizens of the United States.
Mr. Johnson' asserted that the
loyalty of these men cannot be
questioned and he deprecated
such an order - at a time when
this country is . not at war with
any nation and on friendly terms
with the nations of which these
men were formerly citizens.

Congressman Sloan of Nebras
ka never loses an opportunity to
remind the Democrats of the
manner jn which they legislated
to the injury of the farmers.
Speaking a few days ago on the
shipping bill he cited figures to
show that aftet the enactment of
the Underwood tariff law we im
ported 30,000,000 bushels of corn
and 400.C00.0O0 pounds of beef,
most of it from Argentina, where
land values are only half those in
the United States, and labor costs
only half as much. He asserted
that freight rates from Argen
tina to the United States are less
than half the rate from Nebraska
to the Atlantic seaboard. Government-owned
ships, he feared.
would further injure American
farmers by carrying other Ar
gentina products to our markets
at low rates.
Dangers ot Draft.
Drafts feel better when we are
hot and perspiring, just when
they are most dangerous and the
result is Neuralgia, ' Stiff Neck,
Sore Muscles or sometimes an at
tack of Rheumatism. , In such
cases apply Sloan's Liniment. It
stimulates circulation to the sore
and painful part. The blood flows
freely and in a short time the
stiffness and pain leaves. Those
suffering from Neuralgic Head
ache will find one or two applica
tions of Sloan's Liniment will
give grateful relief. The ago
nizing pain gives way to a ting
ling, sensation of comfort and
s
warmth and quet rest and sleep
is possible: Good for Neuritis

Larger Deposits.
Larger postal savings deposits
will now be accepted at the post-
office. This is made possible by
an important amendment to the
Postal Savings Act just approved
by President WL'son. . A postal
savings depositor may now have
an account amounting to $1,000
upon which interest will be paid.
Formerly $500 was the maximum
amount he could have to his cred
it. This enlargement of postal
saving? fatilities will be very
gratifying to thousands of depos
itors whohave already reached
the old $500 limit and are anx-
ious to entrust more of their sav
ings to Uncle Sam. Another fea
ture of the amendment that will
avoid further embarrassment to
the public and to postal officials
is the doing away with the limit
on the amount that could be ac
cepted from a depositor monthly.
Under the old law only $100 could
be deposited in a calendar month.
The amendment abolishes this re-
-
striction. While the Postal Sav
ings System has already proved a
signal success as is shown by the
fact that more than half a million
depositors have over eightv mil
lion dollars standing to heir cred
it, still it has fallen short of meet
ing the full demands of the pub
lic because of the restrictions
which have now been eliminated.
Postmaster General Burleson and
Third Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Dockery have been tireless
in their efforts to secure a modi
fication of the limitation and the
new liberalizing leg'slation is par
ticularly gratifying to them.

1 By JOHN J- MARRINAN.
Washington, D. 0.iSH;il. That
Senator John W. Weeks will he a pow
erful figure at the Chi' -ago Convention
Is now generally coneeiled by till lead
ing Republican politicians throughout
the country. The country known John
W. Weeks as a dlHtin,'uished Senator
from Massachusetts, Mm whose record
spread over eleven years tt continu
ous service In the House and Senate.
Is conspicuously free from activity that
might be the subject of adverse criti
cism. More than this, the country
knows Senator Weeks as a former
banker and successful business man.
John Wf. Weeks was born in Lan
caster, New Hampshire, In 1800. The
Weeks family has been In this country
some two hundred mid fifty years.
With, the single exception of tlie Sen
ator, they have, for the most part,
been farmers. And this was the voea-
As
SENATOR JOHN W. WEEKS.
tion intended for the man now prom
inently mentioned as Republican nom
inee for the Presidency.
It is exceedingly difficult to get Sen
ator Weeks to talk about himself. It
is only through gathering up details
In casual conversation that one can
piece together the course of his career
from farmer boy to U. S. Senator.
"There is nothing in the least un
usual in my life," declares Senator
Weeks. "It i merely the normal life
of a man who has had to work, and
who has worked, to be sure.with a fair
measure of success.", ,
When Senator Weeks was 1(5 years
old, working on the farm and attend
ing terms of school at Lancaster Acad
emy as the opportunity prwented, it
happened that a teacher was needed
at a small district school where the
farmer boy pupils had developed the
habit of throwing the teacher out oi
school with great regularity. Even at
this age, John Weeks was man-sized.
Recognizing his physical attributes
more than measuring his intellectual
ability, the chairman of the school com
mittee offered young Weeks the place,
saying "If you can lick them, John,
yon can keep school." John Weeks
kept school, but he had other asset
besides physical pro,)ortions. He was
even tempered, warm Iieaited. tactful,
strong. These same qualities, which en
abled him to rule the little red school
house without the rod, hare since won
for him leadership honors in business
and in national affairs.
The spring following young Weeks'
apprenticeship as a school teacher, th
Congregational minister of . the town,
Rer. Charles E. Harrington, reeognlz
ing promise In the boy who could man
age the unruly farmer lads of the dis
titc school, asked John Weeks If he
would not like an appointment to th
Naval Academy at Annapolis. V
' This was a brand Lew idea for young
Weeks and met with little favor witli
in the family circle. Weeks had college
ambitions, but he had neve - thought ot
foll owing the life Of the sea. However
the more be thought of it the nfois at
tractive it became, and finally, through
tlie recommendation of the Reverend
Thomas Maeoinlier, Weeks received an
apiKjintment to the Naval Academy
from Congressman Henry W. Blair, of
New Hampshire.
Liking For Naval Affair.
Though a landsman with the heritage
of 4hu farm behind him, Cadet Weeks
developed a strong liking for naval af
fairs and the following of the sea dur
ing his four years at AnnaKlls. This
Interest he has never lost, although by
the act of August 5, 1882. Congress leg
islated him and some seventy other
members of the Class of 81 out of the
Navy. In that year, with ninety ca
dets graduating from the Naval Acad
emy, Congress found that there were
more officers available than there were
berths to till on KhipUwrd. But ten
members of the Class were retained in
the service, the others being sent out
to make their fortunes in civil life.
Though John Weeks lias been far
more successful than tlie average man.
fighting his way upward to a place of
influence In the business world and
claiming his share of the honors that
accompany distinguished public serv
ice, even now he,, is Inclined to resent
the turn of fortune which denied him
a career In the Navy. From this view
point. Senator Weeks' present advoca
cy of preparedness can well be colored
by the personal grievance he bears
Congress In legislating him out of his
chosen career, because at the time we
were "too much prepared."
Entering the Naval Academy in 1877.
Senator Weeks graduated four years
later with the class of '81. At the
Academy Cadet Weeks, besides show
ing aptitude in his naval studies, also
displayed unusual athletic prowess. In
gymnasium competitions it was young
Weeks who lifted the heaviest dumb
bells and who was the pivot man in
the "hish-liMsli-hosh" exhibition. In
those days tlie Naval Academy did not
participate in intercollegiate football or
intercollegiate rowing, but rivalry was
keen among the classes in cutter rac
ing. Cadet Weeks was stroke oar on
many a winning crew. In the artillery
drill Weeks and his room-mate, now
Ceneral Oeurge Harnett. Chief of the
Murine Corps, were the men on the
end of the drag-rope pulling the 3-lnch
field piece. To tlie strong men of the
squad this honor was delegated.
Upon graduation from the Academy,
Midshipman Weeks, with the members
of his class, sailed from New York
to Aspinwall now Colon crossed the
Isthmus of Panama, and sailed on the
United States Ship "Richmond" for Yo
kohama, where the middies of the
tilass of '81 spent two years at the
. ?atl! station... . . v ,
Successful Banker and Broker,
Senator Weeks has never broken the
bonds of warm friendship forged at
the Naval Academy during his six
years' study in the arts of the fighting
man afloat. As an alumnus of the
Academy, he has always been prom
inent in its alumni reunions, where
he is invariably called upon to respond
to the toast "The graduate In Civil
Life." " -
Perhaps It was Its unhrppy fate at
being separated; at any rate, the Class
of '81 has "kept up" with one another
as has no other Naval Academy class.
They have held reirular biennial re
unions to whli h members have come
from all parts of the world. In 1SXX)
Vice-Admiral Criu was the guest of
honor at the Class Reunion held that
year, an elaborate affair attended by
President Tut't and most of the mem
bers of his official family.
Senator Weeks' entry Into civil life
was not attended with any flare of
trumpets. The young engineer went to
Orlando, Florida, to hunt a job. This
he secured with the Florida Iand Com
pany, and by dint of hard work and
the happy faculty of making friends,
which he has manifested throughout
bis career, he soon became Deputy
County Surveyor.
. After Weeks had made rapid strides
ahead in the -engineering profession,
fortune again intervened and turned
the course of his life. A Florida ac
quaintance, who took a strong liking to
Mr. Weeks, advised him that Mr. Horn
blower, son of the senior partner in
the then firm of Hornblower and Page,
was seeking a business partner, and
that he would lie glad to recommend
Mr. Weeks as the man for the arrange
ment. For twenty-five years, subsequently.
Johu Weeks participated In the bank
lug and brokerage affairs of the firm 0
Hornblower and Weeks. Just as he
had been successful as a cadet at An
napolis and as an engineer in Florida,
so John Weeks climbed the rungs of
the business ladder to a position of
influence and wealth. "I am not near
ly as wealthy as most people think,
but I am well enough off so that I
don't have to worry." is the modest
way Senator Weeks puts it.
lMiring the years of his business ac
tivity in Boston. Mr. Weeks found op
portunity to continue his interest in
naval affairs. Foe teu years he served
hi the Massachusetts Naval Brigade,
commanding it immediately before and
during the Spanish-Amtricnji War. On
July 12, 1S08, Weeks received a com
mission as Lieutenant in command of
the Second District of the United States
Auxiliary Navy, whose duty it became
to guard the Atlantic, Coast from New
Hampshire to Rhode Island. Although
the Massachusetts Brigade nad no ac
tual fighting "to do. Jt made an excel
lent record for general efficiency and
Lieutenant Weeks and. his command
were highly commended by the Navy
Department when they were mustered
out of the Service at the close of the
war-
Rapid Rio InVubllo Life.
Senator Weeks' rise in public life hae
been rapid. He r erved for three yeari
as Alderman In Newton, his home city:
for two years he was Mayor, and could
have bad a third term: then he came
to Congress in 1905. from which post
he was elevated to the "Senatorshlp
upon the retirement of Senator W.
Murray Crane.
The first day Mr. Weeks was In
Washington, in company with his class-
mate Stewart of tlie Navy Llnrary, he
met Uncle Joe Camion, then SKaker
Of the House. "Is there anything I
can do for you?" said Uncle Joe. Stew
art.- interMislng. suggested that the
Sieaker give the "y's'je" Congressman
the chairmanship f t cvMumlttee. Mr.
Cannon, ot course, old not do this, but
he placed Weeks on the BsiiUIng and
Currency Committee and the Commit
tee for Expenditures in tht State De
partment. During the year, the death
of the Chairman of this latter Commit
tee and other committee dittoes. ejn
vated Congressman Weeks to lis beaA.
Now, Uncle Joe. reniliilsrtng. points
to John Weeks as the only man he
ever dared to give a Committee Chair
manship during bis first term.
Senator Weeks' first speech in the
House was made in defense of his
naval alma mater at Annapolis. He
rose to answer a vicious attack on
Academy customs In one of the ear
lier discussions of lms:ing. "Hazing",
said he. "differs as widely as a West
Indian hurricane docs from a gentle
summer aeph.vr. Ninety-five per cent
of the hazing at Annapolis is nicely a
collection of boyish pranks. Five ir
cent of It is violent. I do not know
any man in the Navy, or ut of it. who
does not favor puulshi.ig violent haz
ing by dismissal from the Academy,
but I wish to say that to punish ordi
nary hazing by dismissal is both un
just and unfair."
Later, as a member of the Naval Af
fairs Committees of both House and
Senate. Mr. Weeks has rendered in
valuable service by virtue of his naval
training and experience. In 11MM5.
when Congress-nan Hepburn delivered
a most vehement denunciation of the
officers of tlie Navy, it was Congress
mull Weeks who. after spending ten
weeks in preparation, answered the
charge that Naval o'heers enjoyed im
munity from punishment for neglect of
duty, and answered it so completely
that Mr. Hepburn was most effectively
"squelched."
Despite the effort of the Wilson ad
ministration to take the edge off the
preparedness issue, national defense is
to be a foremost factor in the next na
tional campaign, and, as the months
pass. It looks as though the eventual
military policy of the country would
emphasize the Navy as the first line.
Senator Weeks, the only other pres
ent aspirant besides Roosevelt to serve
in the Spanish-American War, is not
Without qualification in this connec
tion. Moreover, the sailor candidate's
attitude toward defense is without the
hysterical supcrlativeness which has
characterized the utterances of some
leaders in the national defense move
ment. A Major General's Tribute.
"Copeerning national defense." says
Senator Weeks, "I believe Congress
should Immedi-itely develop a plan
for the adequate protection of the na
tion on laud and at sea within reason
able cost to the Government. This Is
not the time to be niggardly in our ex
penditures for the protection of the
country, but neither is It the time, in
view of the condition of the treaeury.
to enter niton u program that will call
for reckless expenditures.
"We have never had a consistent
army or navy uolicv. This is due in
some degree to our political system
The carrying on of our military and
naval operations Is to such a degree
dependent on politics that we cannot
do, even under the best conditions,
what is done by our rivals on the other
side of the Atlantic. We have twice
as many navy yards as we need, and
they should be abolished without re
gard to their location. But it won't be
done unless there is an outcry from
the people demanding it, because the
local and political Interests will be too
strong. We shall not get a definite
military and naval policy until we have
a board of national defense which fchall
be Independent of political parties."
Perhaps the man among Senatoi
Weeks' wide circle of friends and ac
quainta.nces who Is best qualified to
pass upon the character and ability ol
the man Is Major-General George Bar
nett, who was for four years the Sen
ator's room-mate at Annapolis and whe
has been his intimate friend ever since.
When you mention Weeks to the Gen
eral, you are met with an outspokeD
enthusiastic admiration which comes
straight from the heart of the man.
"I knew John Weeks as a farmer boy
I knew him as a business man, and 1
know him now as a distinguished mem-
ber of the United States Senate," says
Gen. Barnett. "Throughout the years
Weeks has not changed. He has been
always the same genial, equitable
warm tempered friend of all who knew
him. Frank and square he was as a
boy, and equally so has be been as s
business man."
One phase of the Weeks candidacy
for presidential honors which seems to
have escaped many thus far, is that
aside from Mr. Weeks' Impressive line
up of delegates from all parts of the
country, he is one of the most populat
men who has ever served in the House
or Senate from the Bay State. Nor is
this popularity limited by present 01
recent congressional associations, glnct
he came to the blouse in 1005. John
Weeks has-been making friends, and
friends that stick. , They are scattered
all over the country, many of them will
attend the convention as delegates.
Some will be pledged to other candi
dates. But If thestime eoines when
Root or Burtou or Fairbanks or Cum
mtus go out of the running, this might;
Weeks potentiality in the background
will be fully capable of tearing the rool
off the convention. Farmer boy, mid
shipman, businessman, senator Pres.

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
During the year 1913 there
were 2,689 children deserted In
Cincinnati. The entire number of
children in the county children's
homes of the state on the last day
of August, 1914, according to offi
cial records, was 2,540. It will be
seen that more children were de
serted in tiie wetteEt city in the
state in a year than were in all
the children's homes of the state
cn the date given.
INTERESTING FACTS
FROM DRY FINDLAY
Getter and (.'ore Prosperous
Wiifnut Saloons.
Findlay, 0 (Special.) The people
of Findlay believe thsy have the dri
est city in Ohio, and also believe it
to be as prosperous as any city of its
size, wet ordry. in the state. The
city has been without saloons for
more than seven years. Notwithstand
ing it has been without saloon rev
enue for this period, it has the lowest
tax rate of any city In Ohio.
Last year Findlay paved twelve
streets at a cost of $157.5u8. This
year fifteen streets will be paved at
an estimated expense of $130,000. For
the year ending March 31, 1916, build
ing permits were issued totaling
$445,000. The receipts of the Findlay
postofflce increased $10,000 the past
year over the year previous.
The difference in the moral tone
of Findlay may be noted by a com
parison of the police records now
with the records of twenty-five years
ago. Last year there were 324 ar
rests in Flnd!ay. while in 1890 the
number was 1,644. In March of this
year the number of arrests for all
causes was 19. In March twenty-five
years ago the number was 147.
The dry vote In the city has in
creased through the years. In 1908
and 1911, when the county voted dry
under county option, the city of Find
lay returned a wet majority. In the
statewide campaign of 1914 the city
gave a dry majority of 187. Follow
ing the adoption of the home rule
amendment that year Findlay voted
vnder the Beal law and piled up a
majority -of 363 against the home rule
saloons. Last fall; on the statewide
vote, the city increased her dry ma
jority to 524.
VIGOROUS ENGLISH
CONCERNING SALOONS
Convict Editor Eipresses Views
on Booze.
Columbus, O. (Special.) For a
number of years a weekly newspaper
has been published In the Ohio peni
tentiary. A new editor is now on tlie
Job, as the old one had served his
term and is out. Some one asked the
new editor for an expression on the
saloon, and here is aa extract from
his reply:
"Is the victim of the rattlesnake's
venom in favor of the rattlesnake!'
Is the poor devil whose home, loved
ones, and worldly, possessions have
been swept away by the devastating
tornado very much in favor oi the tor
nado? We should think not. That is
exactly our attitude with reference to
the saloon. It has been the curse of
our existence. If it were not for the
saloon, the chances are we would not
be here. Some day the taxpayers of
Ohio will wake up to. the- immense
burden of taxation Imposed on them
by the liquor traffic. They will then
do away with the awful curse. If peo
ple are sincere In wishing protection
fiom crime, and if they are sincere in
wishing to save young men from be
coming criminals, the quickest way
they can get these things is to abolish
the saloon."
WANTS NAMES OF BOYS
Distilling Company Evidently Wants
to Create New Trade.
Fairmont, Minn. (Special.) The
Sentinel of this place publishes a let
ter written by the Hollister Distilling
company of St. Paul to a local mail
carrier. The letter asks the mail car
rier for the names of the boys in his
town and on the rural routes. He
promises to send him some choice
liquors if he will send in a good list
of boys. The letter closes with this
sentence: ''Get the postmaster to
help you. also the bank cashier and
the express agent."
It Is a safe guess that the distilling
company has hatched some scheme
whereby it expects to make customers
of these boys. It certainly shows its
nerve by trying to use employes of
Uncle Sam. as well as a banker and
express agent, to secure the names.
City Employes On Water Wagon.
Steuhenville, O. (Special.) De
claring there is no room on the city
payroll for drunkards, Mayor W. C.
