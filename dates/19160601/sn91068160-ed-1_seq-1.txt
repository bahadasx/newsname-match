est local interest .this week,and for
the moment wars and rumors of wars
are forgotten.
The great fight within the State
seems to be between Bicket and
Daughtridge for .governor, with the
friends and supports of Bickett seem
ingly the most acme. The Hustler,
taking no part in this fight, can ex
press no opinion as, to the outcome.
It seems to be a foregone conclu
sion that Shipman . and most ot the
other State oflice incumbents will
again receive the Democratic nomina

on the Democratic side is that between
the candidates for the State senate in
this, the 32nd district. Henderson hav
ing the privilege, of naming one of the
candidates and Rutherford the other.
Here the fight lies between R. M.
Oates, T. B. Allen, J. Fpy Justice. R.
Ton Lowndes and V, C. V. Shepherd.
The light is extremely vigorous .and
iflieresting.

cratic side is between R. E. L. Free

Democratic nomination as representa
tive to the State Legislature.
The Congressional Fight.
The congressional fight is of interest
only on the Democratic side; since
Congressman Britt has no onponen

THE CANDIDACY OF M. L. SHIPMAN
J Endorsed for Re-election by Local and.
District Organizations.
(News & Observer, Nov. 14, 1915.)
The undersigned respectfully pre
sent the name of M. L. Shipman as a
candidate to succeed himself as Com
missioner of Labor and Printing. He
is serving his second term, and we
have heard only the highest praise of
the manner in which he has conducted
the affaira of the Department. Where
ever duty called Mr.Shipman has shown
himself equal to the occasion, and his
actions have brought honor to the
State and credit to himself. That he
has doubly increased 'the usefulness of
the Department is ..generally admitted.
There appears little, :if .an.y, sentiment
to displace him, and we .wish merely
to advise Mis friends that he will ap
preciate their support for re-election.
Mr. Shipman has not only madea
capable official during the six years
and half of his incumbency in the po
sition, but he has also long been an
effective party worker, both as editor
and county and district chairman. We

of their .sense of Justice warrants the
sincere belief that Comrdssioner Ship

take, from a business standpoint for
the State, to retire Mr. Shipman at a

The magazine style of the 1916 Re
Fort Edition has met with general ap
proval on the part of those who have
seen ft.
The printing was, for the most part,
better than the press usually turns
lout, but the big cylinder bucked at
times and the result was unsatisfac
tory with his or that cut And it so
happened that the subject of the "bad
print" usually got that particular
copy.
One prominent, dentist, on opening
his copy in the postoffice lobby, ex
claimed to a friend "Do you think I
am really that ugly?" "Well nit
quite," was the response.
Another prominent dentist, Dr. A.
H. Morey, had the worst luck of any,
and it was not hjs fault, either. Not
having a photograph of himself handy,
and being too busy to visit Mr. Baker
in time for the issue, The Hustler, un
beknownst to the doctor, requisitioned
an old negative from Baker, which, it
so happened, showed a month's stubby
growth of beard, having been taken of
Dr. Morey just after he had recovenld
from a severe illness and which he
had had taken solely to send to his
home folks back in. Ohio. This was
used in theedition, greatly to the good
doctor's embarrassment. But the
presses were stopped and the cut taken
out as soon as the doctor v set eyes
upon the paper.
Extra copies of the booster edition
have been printed and can be had at

PROlillT SOOTH CAROLIf
To the Editor of The Hustler:
My name is D. H. Counts. I live, in
Laurens, C, I have spent the sum
mers "In Hendersonville continuously
for about thirty years, which I can
verify by Captain Toms and J. L. Orr.
of tM:p city,
My sister, Mrs. S. H. Sanders, o
Florence, S. C, recently concluded to
build a summer home here. We
bought a lot from Mr. W. A. Smith at
Laurel Park. The agreement between
us was that I should build the house
and that we would divide the costs. 1
live within 75 nfiles of Henderson
ville and she lives within 300 miles of
this Jlty. I came here on the 16th
day of May and brought my own help
with me, a big majority of which lived
on my own farms in Laurens county,
S. C, to do this work. In addition to
this I employed three colored carpen
ters, who owed me more money than
they could possibly have worked out
on this job. I was to pay their rail
road fare and credit their accounts
for the balance.
We broke ground on the 16th May,
and everything ran smoothly for about
a week. On Saturday last. May 27, a
committee of white men supposed to
J De lwelve or nrteen, aS estimated by
be twelve or fifteen as estimated bv
noiei, came to "wait on me' as l un
derstand, to inform me that I must
dispose of my colored labor.
I went to the sheriff of the county."
He was not in his office. A young
man, who informed me that he was
a deputy said I could get no assistance
from him. I went to Mr. Brooks,
mayor of the city, and he said that he
would see me at 3 o'clock' in the af
ternoon. I went to Mr. W. A. Smith
from whom my lot was purchased
and asked tt'm for protection of my
laborers. He replied that he could do
nothing. - -
On Monday I took this matter up
with Mayor Brooks over the phone and
he told me that the sentiment was
against my working colored labor.
That same night Mr. W. A. Smith
phones me thatthere would be fifty
men at my building the next morn
ing to keep this labor rrom going to
Work. I said to him that this ds a
"devil of a country." His reply was
that "we are doing here like they do
in Georgia."
On tits information from Mr. Smith,
whom I had known for a good many
years and believing him to be one of
the leading citizens of Hendersonville.
I took theee negroes to the depot and
purphased their tickets for Laurens,
S. C. and sent them back to my farm.
I want to state that I am a South
Carolina Democrat. I never did a
thing in ruy life to advance the negro
above a white man. 1 bought every
dollar's worth of material that wit
into my house in-the city of Hender
sonville and paid spot cash for it. I
wish to say that in conclusion that I
am the last man living that would
come to Hendersonville knowingly
and violate any law, sod'al. moral or
civil. X
I write this statement to put the
matter clearly before the, good citizens
of Hendersonville.
Every tool chest on our place was
broken open at night between the
time we quit work on Saturday aftei
noon and Monday morning at the time
we started to work, and the tools
taken away. Mjr paint and oils were
destroyed, absolutely. I haven't the
remotest idea who did this "dirty'
work nor have I made any effort to
find out the guilty parlies. I leave
this for the good citizenship of Hen
dersonville to do.

.D. H. COUNTS, OF LAURENS, MEETS
WITH OPPOSITION IN TRYING
TO WORK HIS OWN HELP IN
BUILDING SUMMER HOME IN
LAUREL PARK; TOOLS STOLEN;
. .PAINT DESTROYED.
Hendersonville i$ infested with a
set or clique of men who apparently
would do violence as an extreme
measuring !n seeing that their desires
are carried out. A particular case of
this kind has been demonstrated in
Laurel Park where Mr. D. , H. Counts,
a prominent planter and" stock dealer
of Laurens S. was building a sum
mer home - under ! his personal super
vision and had brought from his farm
six negroes to help him with the work..
At some time near midnight last Sat
urday (accordKng to neighbors who
live in the park) ; unknown parties
visited the premises of Mr. Counts
and his . sister Mrs. S. H Sanders of
Florence, who expect to spend the
summer in the house jdtntly, and'
stole all the tools and overturned all.
the paints and oils that could be
found. The total loss to Mr. Count3
.is nearly $50. He has been unable -to
secure any clue as to the individual:
who performed the deed.
Monday morning there was found"
on a sign made from a plank about
sis. by nine inches long painted the in
scription "RUN NEGROES" placed on
the property. This of course caused
the - negroes Mr: - Counts had b rought
with him, much uneasiness and an effort-
was., made-in receivings police or
county protection, but with no en
couragement Mr. Counts stated that
he had brought the negroes with him
here mainly on account of the faet
that they owed him money advanced
for provisions, etc. He decided after
what had taken place that it would be
safer to send the colored brethren
back home and possibly, Jose , the $200 -which
was owning himv
j Mr. Counts states that he Is n6fa
contractor, and h'as never: contracted
a job of building in his life; He is a
farmer and has had at one time hun
dreds of negroes working for him as
well as many white men.
Last Saturday Mr. Counts was in
formed by his landlord, where he is
boarding here, that there had been a
committee of ten or fifteen white men
waiting on H'hi, but he had been de
tained longer than he expected on
business at a local store. He could
not find out who these men were. He
was approached on the street by two
men who would not give their names
and was told that he had better get
his negroes out of town. He was
phoned by a prominent cit'zen one
night last week that there would be
fifty white men out at his home the
next morning, if he did not move the
negroes he was working, out of town.
Many leadine citizens of Hender
sonville feel that Mr. Counts has been
done a great wrong and believe that
there Is a law that will protect him.
If Mr. Counts had been a contractor or
even was building a house for anyone
else than himself and had employed
negroes instead of white carpenters
then it. would have been a different
case.
The fact that some person or per
sons actually broke the locks of Mr.
Counts tool chests and took from
them the working tools and also de
stroyed a quantity of paints and oils
looks as if there :'s a lawless element
at work in Hendersonville.
The officers of Hendersonville and
county should use every effort in, ap
prehending the guilty party.
Until the tools are returned a shad
ow of suspicion vrti 11 remain upon a
certain element of the working peo
ple of Hendersonville simply because
some irresponsible person or persons
had done a deed of violence in trying
to destroy property, during a period
of time when they (as a whole or large
number) attempted to influence 'an
individual .in the pursuance of his
work.
The best element of the city does
not believe in placing the negro on
any higher plare. than he now stands.
The principle of the whole occur
rence was wrong in forcing the Im
ported belp of Mr. Count's to leave
the city.
. The Hustler believes In taking the
side of the wronged and regardless
of threats of jny kinds will cont'nue
to stand up for the right, it matters
not where the "chips, may fall." .
