CLAYTON BUNCH ANNEX
ONE GAME FROM EAGLES
After Losing First Locals
Come and Rap Two Pitch
ers for Fourteen Hits in
Second Game
Clayton's amatuers broke even with
the Trinidad invincible Eagles, taking
the latter of two games by the one
sided score of 13 to 6. Although the
score indicates a tame affair those
who wittnessed the game will back us
in the statement that ther were en
ough stirring events, baseball and
otherwise, to satisfy the desire of the
most, blase.
This game started with Trinidad
confiident of a victory similar to that
of the day before. Day went on. the
mound for the Eagles and aside from
a little wildness pitched a fairly good
game for the four innings, holding the
local bunch to 5 hits and not any too
well bunched.
' Lynch, a former Cbyton pitcher re
lieved Day at the end of the fourth.
The game from this point started in
earnest. Although the Clayton boys
had a safe lead over the Eagles they
were doubly anxious that their form
er team mate should not be responsible
for their defeat. The first man to
face Lynch was Kilburn who struck
out. The nexa, Lynch's rival, Morton,
who likewise struck out. That ended
strikeouts at the hands of Lynch
Every man who faced him there
after managed to connect in
some way with the ball though
of course not all were hits. In the
five innings with Lynch on tha mound
9 hits were garnerea off him, while
Morton alowed but 11 hits during the
entire nine innings.

First Game, 10-3
Struck out by Morton 8; by Shu
macher 7.
The first game r.hatered the dream
of many an enthusiastic fan. It start
like a real ball game, everything
working smoothly until about the
second inning when errors assisted by
hits let in the winning runs.
Several times during the game it
seemed that Clayton was destined to
give the Eagles a scream for their
money but something always hap
pened there wire so many reasons
wsy the game was lest and such a
scarcity of alibis that we hesitate to
give it space.
The Dalhart Game, 13-9
The principal feature of the Dal
hart occasion was the wonderful turn-
out that accompanied the Clayton
team to' the sandy burg. There were
about 300 Clayton and Texline fans
present and yelled themselves hoarse
even though the interesting but error
ful game was lost. There were also
quite a few Dalhart people at the
park.
State Leaguer for Clayton
Zeke Seiber, a vell-known Kansus
and Oklahoma State league short
stop will arrive in Clayton Saturday
to become a permanent member of the
local force.
As Seen From the.Bleechers
Perhaps many fans have wandered
the "why" Catcher Hatchett's fre
quent, calls for attendance to his
thumb. The reason is that said thumb
is eligible to the hospital. How Hatch
ett manages to stick in the game with
the bruised and broken member is
a matter of much speculation but he
does i r what's mor he pi ivs the j
game.
"Prep" Kiser promises to hold down
the :irst sack permanently. He has
made a good showing even if the po
sition is new to him.
Drummer Lancaster, an old favorite
with Clayton fans drifted on his week
ly visit just in time to take a place
with the boys, although they wished
the position of first base on him one
entirely new to him. His home run
and numerous other hits won him a
place in the sun of local fandom.
McFadden as fielder seems stronger
than ever. It seems he does not con
sider a fiy worth fielding unless it re
quires a 100 yard sprint.
Morton pitched his best game Wed
nesday. He got revenge enough off
his opponent to satisfy the most
blood-thirty.
From what we observe we believe
Mr. Morton will have the moral and
financial support of Clayton folks if
he continues to do what is justly ex
pected of a pitcher.
Howard Moore is not only "sitting
there" as a second sacker but he may
rest assured that a place awaits him
in vuadeville as an acrobat.
Shortstop Kerr has the thanks of
Clayton fans of the simple reason that
Mr. Kerr seems to have valuable
quality of dependability.
Big Bob Thompson ain't as graceful
as our critical eye demands but Lord
how he can soak the pill.
Should Fred Porter' ever get that
strenous wing of his thoroughly har
nessed, Trinidad, Villa and a few oth
ers should worry.
While Zip Garcia played in hard
luck in the first game we feel that
does not disqualify him by any
means.
SUNDAY EXCURSION .
Manager Luther George of the
Clayton team announces that a
special train will be chartered
to Trinidad Sunday June 11, at
which time the Clayton boys will
meet the Trinidad Eagles in their
own nest. The train will leave
Clayton early in the morning and
return the same day. The fare hast
not been announced. Aside from
the base ball event the daylight
trip is considered worth the mon
ey. County Agent Will Arrive Today
Orren Beatty, recently appointed
county agricultural agent for Union
county is expected to arrive in Clay
ton today and to begin duties immedi
ately. Director A. C. Cooley of the State
College extension department sends
his regrets because of his inability to
pay Union county a visit this week.
Mr. Coole,, highly recummends Mr.
Beatty giving his record as having re
signed a position as manager of a
6000 acre Oregon wheat farm to accept
the Union county position.
Mr. Beatty is a graduate of the Or
egon Agriculture college and was lat
er employed by the state in an official
capacity on one of the state's experi
ment farms.
Citizen Operator Goes To Las Cruces
Lorian D. Boggs, Linotype operator
and machinist for The Citizen left
Tuesday to take charge of the Lin
otype department of the Rio Grande
Republic at Las Cruces. Lorian is the
first Linotype operator that Clayton
has furnished the printing world. The
offer of the Las Cruces firm to him
can justly he considered (laflttering
for one of ,his years.
His place will be filled on The Cit
izen by his brother Tim Boggs, form
erly with the News.
A telegram from Lorian Boggs,
now in Las Cruces, states that one of
his fingers was cut off Friday morn

dent occured in the course of his work
in the printing plant of the Rio
Grande Republic.
Oh! JusticeArt Thou Wholly Blind?
Asks Miss Sadie Vere Dc Vere
Sadie Vere de Vere, you dear, de
lightful, Lotus Eyed Maiden; please
take the stand.
Q Ken ye ha, gentle maiden, of
the Mansker case?
A Yes, I know that if he ever
gets a fair hearing, he will be rein
stated in the office of sheriff.
Q Mansker ran for sheriff on the
Republican ticket at the First State
election, did he not, Sadie?
A Yes, and was elected by one of
the largest majorities ever given any
candidate in Union county.
Q Why was that do you suppose ?
A Because he has lived in Union
County for 25 years, and people knew
he was big and broad, and altogether
honest.
Q Did you notice what a slobber
ing effort the "Snoze" made last week,
trying to becloud the facts in the
Mansker case?
A Yes, it was amusing to read
what it said about those Pleas in
Abatement being filed against the va
lidity of the Grand Jury; because Mr.
Mansker could not be tried by the
Grand Jury, but by a PETIT JURY.
Q Were any pleas in abatement
filed against the Petit Jury?
A No.
O Did Mr. Mansker have any
thing to do with drawing the jury?
A Nothing in the world.
Q Who drew that illegal jury?
A Juan J. Duran and acting sher
iff, T. J. Crumley.
Q How many pleas in abatement
were filed.
A The record shows there were
sixteen such pleas filed, any one of
which knocked ut the grand jury. -
Q Then, why did the Snooze men
tion Judge Toombs, name as apparent
ly the only "pebble on the beach"?
A Oh. that is all noliticfll mush
The Snooze knows that pleas in abate
ment were filed in nearly every case
where an indictment was found.
Q But the Snooze boasts that it
is a newspaper; and prints the news
without fear or favor?
A Yes, it prints al those things
Folsom Cannot be Dis-incorporatcd by
Election Says Correspondent
The election scheduled by the county
commisioners for the 27th was a tame
affair. Only one side made an organ
ized effort. Those favoring co-operation
relaxed their efforts when it was
developed in prosecuting violators of
the liquor law that the county com
missioners had no authority to order
such an election and that it takes an
act of the legislature to disincorporate
any village, town, or city in New
Mexico that was chartered since Feb
ruary 2!5, 1889. Hence only a dcsult
ory vote for the corporation.
C. F. Partillo of Fort Wayne, Ind., is
in Folsom his week. The genleman
came in from the north, and ta say he
was lavish in his praise of the scenery,
climate and future of Folsom only
feebly expreses his statements.
R, E. Lime who succeeded A. P.
Maney in business has charge of the
grand concert with authority to handle
the affair as he thinks best. Mr. Lane
is being dsluyed in making up a choir
as some who were to participate have
left town. He proimses a good con
cert on some Sunday in June and
timely publication will be given and
program announced.
Folsom is the firsit and last chance
for drinks for the thirsty of the pro
hibition state of Colorado. It is amus
ing to see passengers jump off the
train to visit saloons near the sta
tion. Folsom being only 10 miles
from the state line of Colorado makes
the saloon business good. Big mail
orders and automobile parties coming
at night for liquor.
Don Thomas Martinez is in Folsom
this week and reports a 1)8 per cent
iamb crop, i his is the highest aver
age, but it can be said that Martinez
is a good busines man.looks after his
sheep and other stock he owns, hence
he gets good results. .
D. Vernon of Canada is in Folsom
seeking a location for a sanitoram.
R. P. Adcv, a newspaper man from
Cleveland, Ohio, spent a week in Fol
som. He was enchanted with Folsom
and the fine country surrouding it. Mr.
Adly saw Folsom at tyer best. The
gentleman was much surprised at the
cxce'lent hotel Folsom affords.
it wants to print, and those only.
Q What makes you say that ?
A Because in its isue of the 13th
inst., regarding Mr. Mansker's efforts
to get his case over to Colfax Coun
ty when he saw he could not get a jury
trial at last term in Union County,
the Snooze said "This undertaking
was quickly abandoned" .
Q Oh, well, what of that?
A Well, it simply shows the
Snooze's disregard for the truth.
Q Well, what IS the truth about
this particular matter?
A That Mr. Mansker, seeing that
he could not get a jury trial in this
County, got the District Attorney,
who represents the State, to join him
m a sipulation to carry the case to
Colfax County, where it could have
been tried at the May term of that
Court.
Q Why did Mr. Mansker enter in
to that stipulation with the prosecut
ing attorney?
A In the hope that he might ob
tain an early trial in Colfax county,
if he could not get one in Union coun
ty.
Q Then, why was the .case not
taken to Colfax county, so it could be
tried at the May term of that Court
A Because the Court denied tre
stipulation entered into by Mansker
and the District Attorney.
Q Then, why didn't, the Snooze
print THAT FACT, instead of saying
that Mansker's effort to get his case
tried in Colfax County, "Was quickly
abandoned?"
A Oh, disputing public records
doesn't bother the Snooze. ,
Q How much did the last term of
court cost the tax payers?
A According to the "New Mexico
Tax Review," for April, 1916, it cost
the tax payers f 1107.27.
Q Sadie, sweet one, do you ever
pray?
A Yes, sometimes I pray like this
Oh, Justice, are -you wholly blind, can
you not see the political persecution
which has found a lodgement in the
Mansker case?

ONE MAKES ESCAPE IN
DARING JAIL DELIVERY
Sheriff's Wife With Winchest
er Rifle Induces Tardy
One to Abandon Flight.
Alex Faked Injury
An attempt on the part of three
prisoners to break jail, Wednesday
evening about eight o'clock, was par
tially successful, inasumch as Alex
Yeagel, charged with horse steeling,
living near Guy, but apprehended at
Guymon, Okla., made good his escape.
The others were returned to the cells,
after an exciting and confusing es
capade. It seems that when Eliseo Martinez,
deputy, and returned the men to the
cells after supper, he placed the three
who atempted escape, in a lower cell
and bared the dor, sliping in the bolt
and leaving the locking of it until he
had put the other prisoners upstairs.
While he was absent the prisoners in
the lower cell, slipped back the bars
and made their escape. Mr. Martinez,
was warned of this by a shout from a
prisoner in another cell. He imme
diately ran down and confronted the
men, firing at Yeagel, (then a short
distance from the jail) who droped
on the ground, and feigned that he
had been shot. Mrs. Crumley seized a
Winchester and "drew a bead" on the
third man, who after gazing into the
business end of a gun, went back in
to the cell. While Martinez was busy
locking in the captured ones, Yeagel
came to" jumped up very hastily,
and ran making good his "get-away."
Yeagel remained "dead" while the
deputy halted another who was mak
ing tracks" toward the hills.
Deputies have been notified in ev
ery district. It is said Yeagel had no
money and will be compelled to "beat"
his way making his capture almost a
certainty.
Sheriff Crumley who left yester
day for Oklahoma City to appear as
wittness in the I.ogsdon case, discov
ered a blanket covering a radiator in
one of the corridor of the jail the eve
ning he left. He was curious and lift
ed the blanket discovered a large hole
that had been made in the brick-wall
with case knives and other instru
ments. This discovery foiled what
might have been a successful at
tempt on the part of the prisoners to
get out.
The man whom Mrs. Crumley stop
ped was one of the men charged with
stealing $8U from Miss Uigginbothant
of Texline.
INDULGENCE OF WATER USERS
IS ASKED
City Superintendent C. H. Claggett.
speaking for himself and on behalf of
the council asks water users to please
be patient as every source of water
supply is furnishing the maximum out
put.
Water users attention is called to
the fact that the consumption of
water is greater now than ever before
and that the dry weather period is
greatest for five years.
Users attention is also called to the
need of economy in the use of water.
Wanotn extravagance may mean per
manent shortage. All three wells are
now in operation night and day, hence
the supply is being taxed to the utmost
Work started this week on the test
well. If the test is successful the well
will he connected with all possible
haste the main pipe line.

pected to accomodate a stock large
enough to supply the trade of that
section for sometime to come. The
íeiv firm will carrv a general line of

Rixey residence is under way. This,
new residence will be a valuable addi
tion not only to that section of the
city but to entire Clayton. The location
