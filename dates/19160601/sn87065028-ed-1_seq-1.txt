Hon. P. I'. Claxton of Washing
ton, f. C, was the baccauaureate
orator and delivered a masterly ad
dress. Mr. Claxton is United States
commissioner of education and no
one knows more thoroughly than he
the value of mental training or the
' best methods of obtaining; it. He con
gratulated the young ladies of Mis
sissippi upon being afforded such
splendid educational ad,:intages ar
those offered by the Industrial Insti
tute r.nd College ami contrasted
their opportunities with those of the
youn ladies in large population
centers of the north and ea t, mar;
of whom are compelled to go to
wcrk as soon as the enter their
' teens and are therefore unable to
t take advr.rtap'ft .even , of noortHV-i
ities of free instruction which are
offered them. He declared that . no
"boy 'or girl should be allowed to
teach maturity without having1 takn
advantage of every opportunity to
acquire knowledge and said that
young people who were compelled
to become bread winners before
completing their education should
arrange to go to school every other
week, thus dividing their time ba
tween earnings financial wealth au
gaining the wealth of knowledge
which study brings. Mr. Claxton h
not only an expert on 'educational
mutters but a forceful and convinc
ing speaker, and his address is jrcn
crally conceded to have been one of
the best ever delivered at the col
l;ge.
Mr. Claxton's address was follow
ed by the deliver of diplomas to
members of the graduating class.
Hon. H. L. Whitfield, president' of
the college, has been too ill to ',
tend any of the commencement ox
excises, and diplomas were delivered
to the graduates by Prof. Babney
Lipscomb, vice-president of the in
stitution. ,
The baccalaureate sermon was
delivered Sunday morning by the
Right Rev. James Atkins, D. D., of
Wanesville, N. C, bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal church, South,
who is one of the South's most dis
tinguished prelates, and his dis
course was scholarly, erudite ard
eloquent. "
Governor Theodore G. Bilbo wa
one of the prominent visitors, bvt
remained here only a short t;n;e,
having arrived late Saturday eve
ning and left at noon Sunday.
Commissioner of Education Clax
ton left at noon Monday for the A.

t'A Paw, Texas, May .10. Gen.
runsti.n has directed a thorough In
vestigation of u report that Mexican
cunMui i north of the border have no
tified their people there will be Iiok-
tilities within the? next few weeks.
I he report grows out of the de
mand that all Mexicans in the Unit
ed Stutes register at the consulate.
At El Paso and other border towns
those who failed to comply with the
nrod.i. nation have been listed and
are bung visited by representatives
of the Carranza government. They
re being told, it is declared, that
war is unavoidable and it is their
duty to register.
Consul Garcia is said to have told
intimates the main purpose of the
rejasti-ation was to ascertain with
which side the sympathies of ' the
Mexicans residing in the United
States would be in the. event of an
uprising. ,
The American military authori
ties are greatly exercised over the
activities of the Carranza consuls,
which they call political incendiar
ism. "
Cftrranzista soldiers captured
Corporal James Peters, negro, of the
Tenth Cavalry, half a mile from the
American camp at Naminuina. tied
hinj hand and, foot nd , sent Mm
north to Villa Ahumado. The other
night, when his guards were asleep,
the soldier worked himself free
from his ropes, he said, and made
his way across country to Jaurez.
This morning he gave himself up to
American guards at the Sante Fe
bridge here.
The military authorities believe
the negroes' story and have so re
ported to General Funston.
Peters was taken before Gen.
Pell and gave a hair-raising account
of his experiences. The adventures
of the corporal had for Gen. Dell,
however, an interest entirely secon
dary to what Peters wa3 able to' re-,
port about Carranzista troop con
centration movements in the state of
Chihuahua. The prisoner confirmed
the previous reports of an unprece
dented gathering of forces on Per
shing's flank.
Gen. Gavira, commander of
Northern Chihuahua, will leave for
Cs.sas Grandes tomorrow, expecting
to ascertain definitely from General
Pershing how the American troops
are disposed and to obtain any other
information that may re of value to
him in the disposition of his own
army. If Gen. Pershing is willing
Gen. Gavira will also discuss with
him the question of withdrawal of
the punitive expedition. Gen. Gavira
will assure Gen. Pershing that he
now has ample forces in the border
land to run every bandit down oper
ating there.

Washington, May 3". - O.ariex
II. Iluifhe, without hsvhg xlen
tut'l, bin r.imp'etely di, (limed ('!,
Litos, velt a a subject of popular
l'culntmn despite the f 41 1 that
the Colonel is the nio-t prolific
talker on the American continent.
The success of Hughes is trace
able, of course, to the doubt which
exists as to his probable action or
the probable action of his spokes
manin the Chicago convention.
There is no necessity, on the other
hand, that one speculate regarding
Roosevelt. He is an avowed candi
date and is moving heaven and
earth in an attempt to acquire the
Republican nomination for a third
term as president.
But 'ilughes" is on everv tonsrue
and thoughts of Hughes in every
mind. It is possible that the hirsute
justice is laughing dans sa barbe.
In all American history there is
no precedent for the present situa
tion. In the first place it ia a mat
ter of general admission that Jus
tice Hughes, without effort, has ac
quired the strongest of all strong
positions m the Republican conven
tion.
And yet no mun knowi whether
the Justice will countenance his own
nnmiivttinn r -hether he will ser
iously "go out after the honor."
In this connection there are two
reports both "live." The first is
that Governor Whitman , of New
ork has been informed that Hughes
witl accept the nomination of the
Republican party if the Progressive
party will concur in that nomination
that Governor Whitman has been
authorized to so Ftate on the flu .r
i f tie convention.
The second report is that the Jus
tice has notified his lieutenants not
to press his vantage; that he has so
sn !: n tecause of his firm belief
that .Reeved would prevent ihe
rriTPs.--ives indorsing the actu. 0
.he Republicans.
There seems to be no question but
that the Justice will not surrender
his present position to accept any
f.-ncr variety save a unanimous
:v.m n.' tion at the hands of all anr.i
iHmoerats. And .here is no doubt but that
Hughes is the strongest of the 13
or more avowed candidates.
In the first place, without effort,
he has developed prodigious
strength. In the two states where
against his expressed wishes his
name was presented to the voters,
h scored conclusive triumphs over
Cummins and Burton in Oregon, and
over Roosevelt in Vermont.
Aid in the second place, the o-fdrf
""' st him, originally posted at S
to 5, have become even more op
pressive. The best that the east now
offers is 7 to 5.
The figures posted in New York
and Washington today follow:
Against Ilughes, 7 to 6.
Against Roosevelt, 5 to 2.
Against Root, 6 to 1.
Against Fairbanks, 15 to 1.
Against Burton, to 1.
