will continue to worry. It
'was admitted today.
There were intimations from many
sources today that the progressives
will stand pat on Roosevelt. Before
leaving New York yesterday for Chi
cago, Perkins emphasized that he is
.for Roosevelt and refused to talk of
a compromise candidate. Under
^present plans, the progressive con
vention will run its sessions prao
ticalJy parallel to the republican pro
gram. Preliminary work is to toe
gotten out of the way June 7 and
June 8 and nominations made on Fri
day, June 9.
It was generally believed today,
however, that the progressive con
tention would choose one of these
two alternatives:
Nominate Roosevelt at once and
wait to see What the republicans
would do.
"Stall" until the republican con
tention nominates a candidate and if
lie is satisfactory, nominate the same
man If he Is not satisfactory, nom
inate Roosevelt, with the third ticket
in the race.
Perkins wa» expected to ctfnfer
with leaders of the Rbosevelt Non
partisan league and with George L.
Von Meyer, director of the Roosevelt
^Republican association.

forty separate contests, involving six

Although Secretary Reynolds of the

the "black and tans" and the "lily

Hughes, Roosevelt and Senator Weeks
were watching the contests closely.
The same rules, In substances, that

.If Carranza would remain silent a

withdrawal could be attempted. As
for Carranza's interpretation of the
Scott-Obregon El Paso conference.
General Scott declared today there
was no agreement for withdrawal nor
any that the Americans would not
hunt down the Boquillas raiders. On
the other hand Scott agreed to have

this has been done.

PREPARE FOR BATTLE
BERLIN, June 1^-The French are
preparing to surrender Hltl 304, last
of the strongly fortified heights re

off Verdun.
Several French positions on the
summit, torn by the pounding Are of
German guns, already have been
evacuated. The next general assault
on the position will probably bring It
Into the hands of the Germans.
From Haucourt eastward, to the
Meuse, the German front la pressing
steadily southward In dally "nibbles"
at the French line. The French are
offering desperately tenacious resist
ance, but are steadily falling back
upon the Charny line. The most furi
ous French counter attacks, delivered
at heavy sacrifices In men, have r»
suited in only temporary successes,
the Germans pressing on after eaoh
fresh check.
The French line has been stripped
of reserves brought up for the de
fense of Verdun. Recent concentra
tions of troops behind the Anglo
French front indicate that the British
are preparing to take over another
stretch of French front, releasing
French troops for service at Vercfcin.
German military critics, comment
ing on France's dire need of more
men for the defense of her great for
tunes, asked today what has become
of the "great Russian army" which
was to have halted the German ad
vance on the fortress. It Is authori

COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 1^—Secre
tary of War Baker, In what was re
garded as an Indication of the trend
of the democratic national platform,
this afternoon gave his party a clean
bill of health In past, present and
prospective legislation and policies,
in his key-note speech at the Ohio
state convention.
A united democracy, backed by four
years of accomplishment culminating
in the successful submarine negotia
tions and faced by a foe divided in
to three factions—'the tariff men, the
forces of "the Great Detractor* and
"peace at any price" men was viewed
by Baker.
iBaker emphasized the enactment
of the federal reserve act and the rw
ral credit bill. The unprecedented
strength of national banks, the direct
election of senators, the federal trade
commission, already effected and the
prospective shipping and child labor
laws were urged as democratic ac
complishments. Of President Wilson
he said:
"His has been the one sane and
serene spirit which will redeem thi.«
age and when the election comes 1*
will be found that the people of Am
erica, whatever their sympathies in
the European struggle, realize that
the one indispensible exponent of the
mind the friendliness and the ideal*
of America in the re-maklng of the
old order In the old world, is the fin
est type produced in this age by the
new order in the new world—Wood
row Wilson."
The republicans, Baker said, are
hopelessly divided. Tariff will be the
Issue, Baker said, if Senator Harding,
scheduled to preside at. Chicago, Is
correct. It will be the foreign policy
with other republicans, he argued.
"And then there is a third group,
headed by the Great Detractor, who
shifting from position to position, se
lects at each time apparently what
lever advantage point seems to offer
an opportunity for making difficult
'the position of the president and
congress," he said. "The motive of
I this group seems to be critical rather
than conservative, and guided by sel
fish ambition."
Of Mexico Baker said:

cannot tell what the future may
bring for us in this situation, but for
my part I shall be most happy if the

Part of Shaokleton Expedition
Stranded on Elephant Island
and Need Assistance.
LONDON, June 1.—The British gov
ernment probably will, take immed
iate steps to send a relief expedition
In search of the twenty-two men of
the Shackleton expedition, stranded
on Elephant Island, near the south
pole.
The Daily Chronicle, which receiv
ed a cablegram from Lieutenant
Shackleton, announcing his arrival at
the Falkland islands, urged the gov
ernment relief committee,. whose for
mation was announced ty Premier
Asqulth yesterday, to move quiokly.
The Chronicle asked that expedi
tions be sent to the relief of both the
Shackleton party and the Ross sea
expedition which started from the
New Zealand, side of ,the south pole
and was stranded when the steamer
Aurora broke from her moorings.
Lieutenant Shackleton was asked
by cable today to forward further de
tails of the progress made by his ex
pedition. Hif£ first message reported
merely that his ship, the Endurance,
was jrushejl in the Ice floes and that
the party left on Elephant island waa
in dire need of rescue.
WAITE SENTENCED TO DIE
IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
I pronoyncrd. he replied clearly, "I have
.«• inot." He then asked that he be per-
to say a few words. The re­
quest was granted and" in a steady
voice, Waite began his. rpeech.
"I wish to thank the court," he be
gan, "for the fair and expeditious
manner in which my trial was con
ducted. I thank Mr. .Brothers (the
way in which he did his ciuty toward
the people and the justice he has
done me.
"I also thank my counrel, Mr. Deuel,
for his efforts. He is sincere in hi^
belief that I am insane and did all he
could.
"To ask the forgiveness for those
whom I have wronged would be al
most impossible. But I am willing to
give up my life in partial pament for
the hurt 1 have done."
PerCy Peck, son of the old man
Waite murdered in hopes of gaining
