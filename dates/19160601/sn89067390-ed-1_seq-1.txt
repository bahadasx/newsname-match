Fictitious financing. Secre
tary McAdoo has given to the press a
itatement declaring that the income
tax will this year bring into the Treasury
125,000,000 more revenue thin he
estimated last fall. Tnis statemiot is
to be followed by the suggestion that
the stamp tax should be repealed.
Speaker Clark and other prominent
Democrats have advised the President
that the stamp tax is exceedingly un
popular and is certain to militiate
against Demncratic success in Nov
ember. McAdoo will, therefore, do a
little more juggling with the Govern
ment's finances, to the end that this
unpopularity may be obviated until
after the November electon. Juggling
the figures does not, however, produce
revenue, as every one knows. And
after the election the people will be
called upon to pay the bill. Then ac
cording to the present program of the
Administration, there will be provided
increases in taxes sufficient to make
good those which are abolished pend
ing the election. This is not, (f
course, an honorable method of deal
ing with the finances of the Govern
ment or with the people. But then
honor is not a matter of importance to
this Administration. It was not honor
able to swell the Treasury balance by
padding the "general fund with sums
which did not belong there, but that
was what Secretary McAdoo did, as
has been pointed out in this corre
spondence, and his purpose to abolish
unpopular taxes before the national
election, with the full knowledge that
exessive taxes will have to be collected
later in order to make good the Demo
cratic deficit, is entirely typical ol the
methods which the present Administra
tion never hesitates to employ. It is
a kind of politics which will not gain
any votes from intelligent voters.
House Passes Shipping Bill:
By a vote of 211 to 161 the House
his passed the McAd to Wilson Ship
ping Bill, this being very nearly a tar
ty vote. The bill was improved, in
the opinion of tome who voted for it,
by eliminating the Secretary of the
Treasury from membership on the
Shipping Board it creates ar.d the sub
stitution of Commerce, alonj with the
Secretary of the Navy. Those acquaint
ed with the characters of the Secretar
ies of the Navy and of Commerce,
however, realize that this actually re
sults in little improvement. The bill
provides for the investment of $50,
000,000 ol Government funds in ships,
to be built or bought or chartered at a
time when no such vessels can be
built in American shipyards because
of their crowded condition in time to
aff ird relief of the shortage of shipping
incident to the European War, and at
a time when completed
vessels can be neither bought nor
chartered except at exorbitant prices,
unless, of course, it be the German
ships interned in American waters.
Many House Democrats are frank to
say that they voted for the bill rather
than incur enmity of the Administra
tion, but that they sincerely hope that
the Senate will defeat the measure.
Tillman Shames Democrats:
To the infiuite horror of Democrats in
both Houses of Congress, and of the
Administration Senator Tillman, of
South Carolina, has told some plain
truth about his party in debate in the
Senate. Mr. Tillman has said that
the river aud harbor "pork barrel,"
which the Democrats are determined
to put through and on the provisions
ol which they are counting to aid them
in gaining re election, is simply "crimi
nal waste." He has pointed out that
this sum would build two modern, first
chvts cruisers and has insisted that, itr
view of the condition of the Navy, the
money ought to be spent in that way.
Describing conditions in Congress since
the Democrats have been in control,
Senator Tillman said: "You vote for
my steal, ar.rt I will vote for your steal,
hat enrne to be the popular slogan in
Congress." The Senator continued:
"I cannot understand such a policy at
all. I do nut waul to hurt anybody's
ssusi'jiiiiiui or wound anvbodr't ktl
ings, but tome this expenditure would
be criminal under the circumstances
now existing. Why should we spend
all this money in the face of the fact
that we are compelled greatly to in
crease taxes in order to run the Govern
ment this year?" Senator Tillman
declared that he could not be influ
enced by attempt to bribe SoutJi Car
olina Congressmen by putting into the
"pork barrel" 8300,000 for the im
provement of rivers and harbors in that
State. Mr. Tillman concluded with
the declaration that, "If this bill does
pass I pray God the President will
have the courage to veto it."
Militia won't Serve.: Accord
ing to information made public by the
War Department, the President's call
for the roobilizaion of the National
Guard of Texas, Arizona, and New
Mexico has resulted in failure. So
many members of the Guard have re
fused to, serve that, the War Depart
ment officials say, it will require months
to mobilize any considerable force of
militia. Of the second regiment, of
Texas alone, 116 men have refused to
join the colors for service along the
boundary. It is further disclosed that
the Adj'itanl Generals of these three
States had ten days notice of the
President's purpose to call on the
National Guard to assist in patroling
the Mexican border, but notwithstand
that fact they have made comparative
ly little progress and there is no pro
spect of these States turning out any
where near the paper strength of thtir
National Guard organizaltons, or even
anywhere near as many as equipment
has in the past been provided for by
the Government. In the estimation
of the War Department, this experience
has shown the folly of relying on the
National Guard as a part of the nation's
first line of defense, just as was con
tended by Secretary Garrison, and re
jected by the President.
Advics for the Democrats
Arthur H. Vandenberg of Gratd
Rapids, in his keynote speech as tem
porary chairman, to the Republican
state convention here today, declared
that the National Democrat convention
at St. Louis next month can write its
platform "in five short words; "we
hive changed our minds." And the
country's answer," said Mr. Vanden
berg, "will thunder back: 'So have
we."
Mr. Vandenberg declared that the
Republican party stood behind Presi
dent Wilson "in matters of internation
al moment." but he criticised the
the President's foreign policy and ur
ged the convention to stand unitedly
"for anew national leadership in which
we may have a confidence equal to our
loyalty."
The Democrats, he said "promised
us economy, yet their first congress
spent 177,000,000 more thanany Con
gress which has preceded it. They pro
mised us an extension of the rural free
delivery, yet their postal manipulations
have set back the R. F. D. a decade
they promised us a faithful preservation
of the civil service, yet the civil service
has been practically emasculated by
the job raids of a political Ku Klux
Ktan. .They promised us freedom of
debate and action in Congress, yet the
House has been gagged and bound as
never before."
Disdussing Republican policies, Mr.
Vancenberg said:
"We stand for protection for Amer
ican territory protection for American
men and women protection for Amer
ican industries protection for the
American fl'g."
Samuel 0 Dunn, an expert statisti
cians in such matters, reports that few
er miles of railroad were built in this
country in 1915 thanany year since
the Civil War. The building of rail
roads is the real index to pros
perity. A hundred miles of
new railroad track make a better re
flection of sound conditions of indus
trial well being than a hundred new
concrete structures hurriedly thrown
together for the manufacture of war
material.
To Help the Blind
The receipt of a single anonymous
subscripton of 810,000, conditional
only on 82500 more being raised, was
announced in St. Louis today by James
C. Jones, Chairman of the Missouri
Commission for the Blind. This sub
scription is the result of a an appeal
for funds made by The Commission
in order to make available an appropri
ation of 812,500 made conditional by
the last Missouri L"gislature. This
donation is entirely conditional on
82500 more being raised immediately.
The effect, therefore, is to nuke avail
able a total sum of 825,000 if the
people of the State who "believe in
utilizing the education obtained. by the
the blind children at the Missouri
School (or the Blind will contribute
the small sum of 82500.
Until the subscription of $ 10,000
was obtained, members cf The Com
mission had little hope of being able
to raise the 812,500 as prescribed by
the Legislature, and therefore little
hope that the purposes for which The
Commission was created would be of
any benefit to the blind citizens of the
State. Up to that time only 889.25
had been subscribed, but within
twenty-four hours alter receiving the
510,000 subscription, five 8100 sub
scriptions were announced by Mr.
Jones, making the total subscribed to
date 810,589.25. So hopeful are the
members of The Commission as the
result of the new impetus given their
efforts, that an endeavor will be made
to raise cot only the balance of 82,000
now required but to increase but to
the sum to 825,000 making
available for the use of The Commis
sion a total sum of 837,500.
The purposes for which all money
subscribed will be used are as follow::
To reduce through preventive mea
sures the number ol causes ol
blindness in future generations.
To provide tools, work shops and
materials for productively employing
adult blind citizens of the State.
To provide for marketing articles
manufactured by the adult blind and
obtaining ccnua:ts for them.
To tabulate names, conditions and
needs of the blind in Missouri.
Of the 810,589.25 subscribed to
date only cne contribution of $5.00
has been received by The Commission
from any one in the State living out
side the city of St. Louis. One sub
scription of 82.00 was received from
Hannah Badgley of East St. Louis, Illi
nois. The Commission is hepeful
that large subscriptions will be ob
tained in Kansas City, St. Joseph.
Springfield, Joplin and Hannibal, to
say nothing of contributions from other
parts of the State.
"Our work is one which will benefit
the entire State, and there is no reason
why charitably inclined citizens from
every city town and village in the
State should not contribute something
to the work. We con ider cur cause
even a more laudable one than any
devoted strictly to charity as it will
minimise the necessity forch .rity by
aiding persons who otherwise might
be objects of charitv to become at
least partially sell supporting "
"We feel thi.t our success in rais
ing the 812,500 is practically assured"
continued Mr. Jones, "but it is up to
the people of the State to contribute
what they can afford and do it prompt
ly, so that there may be no further
doubt."
"Our 810,000 contribution has
been made conditional on the raising
of the smaller sum, and I certainly
hope the public will not fail to ap
preciate what this means toward the
success of The Commission and the
protection of the blind."
All contributions should be sent di
rect to James C. Jones, treasurer, of
1000 Third National Bank Building
St. Louis. Acknowledgment will be
made through the newspapers of the
State of all contributions, and an hon
or roll will be kept in the archives of
the Commission for the Blind of the
addresses and amounts of all subscri
bers to the fund, as a record for future
generations, of those who have aided
iu the work.
Col. Roosevelt's Hopes
Col. Roosevelt is far wiser than most
of his friends. He knows that any
nomination which comes to him as the
result cf a struggle in a convention is
worthless. Therefore, he wanjs no
contest to be waged in his behalf.
Furthermore, he hopes "that the del
egates who go to Chicago will nomi
nate some some man on whom Re
publicans and Progressives can com
bine, and who, moreover can be heart
ily supported by all independent citi
zens, and particularly by all independ
Democuts who are prepared to put the
vital honor and interest of this nation
above all mere partisan consideration."
We have no hesitancy in assuring
Col. Rocsevelt that such a man will be
nominated at Chicago. The Colonel's
hopes are as good as (ullfilled at this
very minute, though the convention is
still some time in the future. The
Republican party this year owes an
equal duty to itself and to
the country to present a candidate who
will secure the free and cordial support
of all men who hold to the principle
which Col. Roosevelt has here so well
expressed. There are many such
men in the Republican party. Some
of them are now being actively con
sidered in connection with the nomi
nation which is so soon to be made,
and some of them have latent consider
ation in the minds of men who think
some "dark horse" will carry off the
prize. But however he is, he will con
form to the principles which Col. Roose
velt has formulated uot because he is
necessarily a Roosevelt man but be
cause he is a Republican. Col. Roose
velt is talking the language of Repub
licanism when he calls for men who
put the vital interest and honor of this
nation above all mere partisan considerations.
Bryan's Advice
Mr. Euttinsky Bryan has taken his
pen in hand to address some unsought
counsel to Wocdrow Wilson. Through
the "Commoner" Mr. Bryan advises
the President that his opponents have
the advantage of him in the popular
vote by more than a million margin,
that there is in addilioa a serious Dem
ocratic defection among voters ol Gcr "
man and Irish antecedents, and that
the only way in which Wilson can hope
to be re-elected is to secure support
from what terms the "peace element"
in the Repuplican party. To this
end, Eryan urges Wilson to start forth
with snme kind of a movement of a
movement for warring nations of E i
ropc. A more insulting proposotion could
hardly have been addressed to a man
of fine instincts. But Bryan doubtless
knows that he is safe in making the
proposal. The proposal is based upon
the theory that war or peace are all
the same to Wilson, if only either one
one will help him gain a re-election.
It must be admitted that there is much
to sustain this theory. Pacificism and
defence have already been shown to
mean nothing to the President except
as they are connected with his politi
cal fortunes. Sc, too, with advocacy
ol our opposition to a tariff commission
with the putting on cr the taking off
u( an embargo on arms to Mexico,
with the sending or withdrawing ol
troops from the southern border, and
with countless other matters in which
the grave concerns of the nation even
to the inclusion of ourloreign, relations,
which have been made to serve as a
football of party politics and as an de
ni' nt of personal advantage to a man
who. by accident, chances to be in a
position to make such action possible.
Despite its origin, the id a will ap
peal to Wilson. We have no doubt
that he has thought of it before of his
own motion. If he could make peace
in Europe, he could frame another
phrase for his campaign aod he could
also present a claim for, the Noble
peace prize of 840,000, which, if he
received it, we may be sure he will
keep for himself. Maybe he will act
on the advice, even though it does
come from Bryan. If so we shall have
another angle from which to take this
measure.
