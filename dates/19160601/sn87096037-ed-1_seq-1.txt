With Use
There is a delightful thrill in the smoothness with which
the Willys-Knight motor "picks up" without "choking"—
without the slightest vibration.
There is great satisfaction in being able to throttle
it down to a walking pacc on high gear.
But the remarkable superiority of the Knight sleeve
valve motor lies in the fact that—
Though all other motors grow noisy and lose power
and smoothness—
The Knight sleeve-valve motor grows si:eadily quieter
with use and increases steadily in power, smoothness and
all-around performance.
The factory's enormous production made it possible to
price this wonderful car at $1125 for the touring car, and
$1095 for the Roadster.
Ask us to tell you about the Willys-Knight.

Liquor Interests Condemn the Movies
The picture show—there are some
24,000 in this country, it is said—is
diverting thousands of dollars every
day from the saloon. It is more pop
ular than the "poor man's club," and
the liquor interests are declaiming
against the "movie menance." Not
on financial grounds, however. They
declare that the tilaas representing
"conditions surrounding the retail
liquor trade are preposterous and un
truthflly magnified—such display hav
ing misleading etJ'ects Upon the public
mind, particularly upon the minds of
women and children." In reply to
this complaint, voiced by the National
Liquor Dealers' Association and the
liquor press, the Photo Play Maga
zine oilers "to rua a set of pictures
fully descriptive of any big thoughts,
high ideals, public-spirited aotions,
or types of splendid manhood, which
the saloon business may be evolved
or will evolve." It's now up to the
liquor men. Here's an opportunity
to prsent to the publie the good points
of the trade and to use a most effective
advertising medium.
