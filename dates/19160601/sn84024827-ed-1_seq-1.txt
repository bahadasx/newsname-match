ment has created a sensation here.
MEXICO ..CITY, .May .31.
Claiming that the words and pro
ttsts of' the United States have
been entirely in contradiction of
their acts and that in spite of pro
tests not to intervene in the af
fa:rs of Mexico, scldi-rc of the
United States are in Mexico with
out the consent of the Mexican '
Government and in violation of
Msxicos sovereignty, the Mexican
government row asks for the im j
mediate withdrawal of those
trocrs.. The reauest is made in
a 12 COO word rtctsmade public at 1
the foreign office today about j
noon. i
The note recites that the American !
troops crossed the. border after the :
Co!umbu incident without the pel-'
n.ission of the Mexican government. !
vasinn then solply because the United
States said they had misinterpreted
the attitude of the Mexican govern
ment. Calls it "Invasion.
Wh(n the second expedition crossed

friendship by the United States and
the expressed desire, for non-intervention

of the Washington government, the

to the first crossing of the frontier by '
American troops after the illa raid
at lolumbus. the note ins.sts that in

S. ott and runston, another expedit .on
crossed the border line, thus violating
all the prcetits of International law
and committing an act of invasion.

of the expedition which entered after
the Columbus raid, now is over. In
spite of this fact American troops still
remain on .Mexican soil. To contend
that political disorder in this country
justifies this, act of the American
military forces is in conflict with the
repeated professions of the Washing
ton government relative to non-interference."
"Trouble Lies in U. S."
The note says that much of thp
trouble in Mexico is due "to the at
titude of the United States in not pun
ishing conspirators in the United
States, who have plotted the downfall
of the present constitutionalist gov
ernment, and to the acts of Washing
ton in refusing to permit I lie shipment
of arms and ammunition to enter Mex

the belief that there would be no im

De Factos Fail .
High officials said the de facto gov
ernment so fr had failed utterly to
dMi onstrate its ability to protect the
bolder against bandits, and expressed
the opinion that troops would stay in
Mexico until this was done. The un-
