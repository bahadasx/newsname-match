TELLS WHY FACTORY
HERE ISNTjNSPECTED
A. Sidney Johnston, Chief of
Missouri Department, Out
lines His Work.
CAN'T COLLECT FEES
Force Is Inadequate, He De
clares, and Scope Is Much
Too Broad.
In tlio following; letter to the Mis
souri in, A Sidnov Johnston, chief in
spector and counsel of the state de
p.ii timnt of factory Inspection, tells,
win the local plant of tile Hamilton
Brown KIiui Faetorj has not been
look d over.
Editor tin' Missouri. : 1 hae rejil
with much interest stories In tlio
I)ail Missounan dotailms working
conditions generallj in Columbia fac
tories and business establishments. I
note particular reference was made by
Miss Hamilton to the fact that the
Hamilton-Brown Shoe Factor there
has neer been inspected by 'this de
partment. Impossible to Ho the Work.
Tins statement is true, notwith
standing tli.it this is the onlj state
agimj in anj waj charged with re-
sponsiliilitj tor sucX conditions there
and even where else in Missouri. This
sounds like a confession, and in a
fashion, it is, but it is one which,
though 1 am ashamed to make, I am in
no degree responsible for. The rea
son is that while this department is
charged with the responsibility of In
specting everj factory and establish
ment in the state twice a jear, it is a
phvsical and Imancial impossibility to
accomplish the work because of ab
surd and impossible restrictions In the
law.
In my biennial report for 1913
1914, copies of which were furnished
to each member of our last Legisla
ture, I explained the conditions as
full) as I posstbl) could and told
what was needed to correct condi
tions. No Help From Legislature.
When the legislature was in session
I appeared before various committees
and pleaded that changes be made
which would provide for inspection in
Columbia and every other manufac
turing (stablishment in the state. No
relief was forthcoming.
To give jour readerb some idea of
the dilhcultics under which I labor,
I would say that this department Is
not now receiving, and lias never in
its history of nearly a quarter of a
centurj received, a single solitary cent
for its maintenance from the revenue
fund of the state.
It is and alwajs has been forced to
fight for its existence by collecting
fees before it can pay rent, salaries,
postage, printing or any kind of ex
penses whatever The fees collected
must be -sullicient to defray ev ery ex
pense incurred. Therefore, the lirst and
primary thought in the operation of
this department is the collection of
fees to maintain it rather than the im
proiement or the uplift of working
conditions.
Can't Collect Fees From All.
Furthermore, the law while saying
"every such establishment in the
state" shall be inspected, forbids the
collection of anj fees in cities which
have populations of less than 10,100
inhabitants. If 1 should go to Colum
bia to inspect the Hamilton Brown
Shoe Factory for bad conditions or
violations of law of any kind, my ex
penses would have to be borne out of
fees collected elsewhere. This would
he bad enough if the fees collected
clsew hore w ere suiricicntly large to Jus
tifj their expenditures, but they are
not Furthermore, the time required
would be absolutely lost from the
standpoint of fee collecitons, and still
further the actual work of properly
inspecting in cities where wo can col
lect fees is more than it is humanlj
possible for the emplojes of this de
partment to accomplish.
To prove this I need only call atten
tion to the numerous duties to be per
formed, and the facilities we have for
performing tiieni. We arc required to
inspect "not less than twice a ear all
factories, warehouses, freight depots,
machine shops, laundries, tenement
workshops, bakeshops, restaurants,
bowling allejs, theaters, concert halls
and places of amusement, and all
other manufacturing, mechanical and
niercantile establishments and work
shop, in all cities having a population
of loooo inhabitants or more."
Ten Cities Must lie Sened.
The foregoing means we have to in
spect practically every establishment
regardless of kind or character in all
such cities in the state. There are ten
such cities St. Louis with 700,000 in
habitants, Kansas City. St. Joseph,
Springfield, Joplin, Webb City, Seda
lia, Jefler.son City. Hannibal and Mo
berly. Columbia has, according to the last
ceinsns, slightlj less than 10,000 inha
bitants. So have St. Charles, Cape
Girardeau. Poplar lslutr and several
other cities with perhaps more indus
trial life even than Columbia. Hut
none ever leceiies regular inspec
tion by this department.
We are required to protect the
health, lives and comfort of all men,
women and children in all kinds of
establishments in all places by safe
guarding machinery, by improving
heating. lighting, ventilation, and
sanitation. In addition to all this, the
enforcemint of particular laws, such
as the state-wide nine hour law for
female emplojes, the state-wide child
labor laws, the occupational disease
law and the sanitarj foundrj law the
enforcement of all of these is dircctlj
charged to this depaitment.
Points to Poor Facilities.
And what facilities have I with
which to do this work.' Seven untrain
ed underpaid deputy Inspectors, two
assistants and one clerk! Why have I
not more, when all are more than self-
sustaining? Because the Legislature
twenty jears ago said that at no time
might more than seven deputies be
appointed, because it has since refus
ed to increase 'salaries above $100 a
month, because it still has refused
even to allow the expenditure of all
the fees collected either for the ap
pointment of men or women inspec
tors who will work and wliose work is
needed
If we must have a fee s.Wem, ought
not all the fees to be devoted to the
maintenance or the upbuilding and
improvement of the department to the
benefit of conditions an 1 the better
enforcement of our laws? Yet by lim
iting our appropriation to a certain
amount of what is so collected a part
of our fees at the enil of every bien
nial period automatically reverts to
the general revenue fund of the state
instead of remaining in the factorj in
spection fund to be utilized bj the de
partment. If seven inspectors were sufficient
twenty years ago, at a time when in
dustrial activitj in Missouri, with its
accompanjing need for safeguarding
the lives, health and comfort of all
classes and ages of industrial woik
ers, was practicalij unknown, doesn't
it seem ridiculous that the state
should now have the same antiquated
facilities?
No Kevvanl for Ei'licicncj.
If a salary for those seven of $100
a month was sufficient then, would It
naturally seem possible to get equallj
efficient, to say nothing of more ef
ficient, inspectors now? And what in
ducement to become efficient is there
to a $100-a-month inspector who
knows that his efficiency will ordi
narily go unrewarded? The organi
zation of this department alwajs
changes every four J ears with each
political administration. The inspec
tor knows he can't hold his "J3b"
more than four jears, let alone be in
creased in salary as his efficiency in
creases.
The foregoing are some of the han
dicaps under which this department
labors in its endeavor to render ef
ficient useful service to the state and
to those who toil in her industries. I
trust they will be enlightening to jour
readers, and also that they may im
press the importance of some radical
changes being made in our organiza-
ion and scheme or auminisiranoii
which will result in better protecting
industrial workers not only in Colum
bia but in the entire state.

The doors were opened at 9: 4".
o'clock, after the visiting alumni and
relatives of the graduates had recoil

premium when the 700 graduates, in
caps and gowns, filed into the audi
torium. The program was opened by the
Universitj orchestra. The invocation
was offered bj the Rev. M. A. Hart of
the First Christian Church.
The announcement of prizes, hon
ors, scholarships and fellowships by
President A. Ross Hill was followed
bj the Impressive ceremony of the bo
stow ing of degrees.
President A. Ross Hill addressed tho
graduating class on "University
Ideals."
"We have had a great increase in
enrollment as a result of the demo
cratic movement in the past few
jears," he said in conclusion. "This
democratic ideal is fraught with
dinger, however, in the possibility
that there may develop in the minds
of the people the false Ideal of Judging
the school's worth by Its enrollment.
The worth of a school must bo judged
by its intellectual ideals as expressed
through its graduates and not by tho
number of graduates."
The conferring of the honorary de
gree of Doctor of Laws upon Curtis

by the audience's singing of "Old Mis
