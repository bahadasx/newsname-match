VOLUME 7. , FRANKLINTON, LA., THURSDAY, JUNE 1,19109. NUMBER '.
LEGISLATURE GETS BUY 1
Committee Named to Draw
Primary Law Cattle Di)in
ping Bill Assured.
loth houses of the LI gil;dtnre
began to grind in earnest TIhurs
day. Numerous impvrtant cmn
mittee hearings were held. As
clear road for the statewide cat- p
tie dipping bill aimed at the cattle
tick appenred certain. Th'e SI
Byrne bill carrying the s).0Uo,0U iti
bond issue fuor New Orleans slid i u
through the House with little up- h
position. The vote was 10; to 8.
Under a suspension of the rules fr
it was carried to the Senate city!
affairs committee immedtately. t
Governor Pleasant's message,
dealing chiefly with the financial sQ
situation, was received and read
in both houses. Reading of the in
message was followed with close tr
attention in both chambers but, V
as it is rather complicated, must m
of the members waited the oppur. th
tunity of reading the printed t
message. TI
An increase in the state,s rove- e
n-me by one of three miethods of
increased taxation stands out as ,th
the feature of the message. The P
total state deficits figured at SI,
.23.,512.91, which includes the n
obligations of the penitentiary, sel
conservation commission, general the
fund and money borrowed for oc
storm and other emergency pur- cal
poses. col
Abolition of the state board of Th
appraisement and equalization pci
and substitution of a state tax wa
commission; substitution of a su[
superintendent for the conserva- vid
tion commission, and of a general pec
manager for the penitentiary boW
board and recommendation of wit
dual assessments, a different
sul;
basis for state and local assess
ments being permitted, are the has
other chief features. go`
A caucus of Democratic inem- thre
bers of the Legislature was or- intf
ganized tonight in the House I tt
chamber with ninty representa- dec
tives and twenty-two senators per
present. up
Senator C. M. Cunningham
was elected chairipan and com
mittees were appointed on rules
and to prepare the primary and
registration laws. Senator J. E. ers
Doussan, of Sti James. was nam- ass
ed chairman of the primary elec- jec
tion law committee. With the con
my
exception of two or three "out tioi
and out" Parker Democrats, all fro
the Democrats in both chambers Ma
went on the roll of the caucus.

State Superintendant's Views
o n Selecting Parish Supt,
T. I-1. Harris Strongly Ad
vocates Appointment by
e School Board.
- In order that thle scol c)s of tihe
t state nuI;iy nott et nli ixd upi with
I p lti( , trite upt. 1larris
e strongly urges thati the I'iiislh
Ishn b )rd appmint the super
L intendent 4f edlueation and not
Sunder any circumstances to leave
- his election to the popular vote.
\V We quote from a recenet letter
from Mr. llarri adldressed to
Mr. F. 13. Bateman, pre-ident of
the parish school board:
1 think it would be a ditinict
lstep hackwai d to throw the sflc
tion of the parish superintendent
into a popular election. Tnhis is
true Ino matter holw intelligent the
voters are or how earnlest they
may be in their etfor:s to secure
the most competent official for i
the office of superintendent.
Teachers who may enter the race
for this oflice will naturally ex
pect to win, and in order to do so 1
they will make combiniatioll with
political factions and puomises to
voters that will prove a detri- s
ment to the best interest of the
schools. The result would be that n
the parish superintendent would "
occupy the same position politi
cally that the shariff, the clerk of o
court or the assessor, occupies.
The schools should be kept out of 1,
politics, and the most effective
way to do this is to elect the et
superintendent in the manner pro,.
vided by law, viz., to permit the
people to elect a small school a'
board and then charge that board
with the duty of selecting the
superintendent. E
3My opinion is that your board
has acted wisely, and should the 1(
governing committee attempt to
throw the selection of the super- SE
intendent into a popular election,
I think the school board should 6(
decline to appoint any man who C
permitted his name to be voted n
upon in the popular election. 2.
Yours sincerely,
T. H. Harris. 5
