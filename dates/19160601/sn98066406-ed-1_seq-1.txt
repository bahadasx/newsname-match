Yale Citizens Observe Decoration
Day in a Fitting Manner.
Although a trifle cool and bracing,
the weather given ub for Decoration
day of 1U16 was most beautiful and a
welcome change from the many cloudy,
rainy days of the spring.
A large crowd gathered at an early
hour in the morning and the line of
march to the cemetery was formed at
nine-thirty. The Clifford band headed
the line, followed by students from all
grades of Vale high school. The Boy
ScoutH in their uniforms came next and
the Sons of Veterans, members of the
(J. A. It. and citizens in autos and car
riages completed the line, with many
following on foot.
Arriving at the cemetery, the graves
of the soldier dead were strewn with
(lowers and Hags and given the honor
due them. The return march was then
made.
At one-thirty Central hall was filled
with an interested, attentive audience
to listen to the program for the after
noon. Key. Mragg gave the invocation
after which John 1'. Sheeny introduced
J. E. Beavis as chairman.
In his own free, happy manner Mr.
lieavis made everyone feel heartily
welcome and announced the numbers.
Two chorus songs were sung by pu
pils of the Tth and 8th grades, and
recitations were given by Helen Palmer
and Richard Uradfield. Then came
the little elocutionist from the county
seat, Janness O'Kourke, who has quite
remarkable talent for a twelve-year-old
young lady.
An original poem was given by com
rade Clayton which was amusing and
interesting to the audience.
The address of the day was given by
Shirley Stewart, well known, politically
at any rate, to many Yale citizens. lie
spoke in highest econiums of the brav
ery and martial spirit of those who
left all to stand for their country's de
fense, and his words came to his hear
ers with a power and force long to be
rememtered. He brought them down
to the perplexing present day question
of preparedness and while no one is
wishing or desiring war for our own
country, still, there would be the same
instant answer to our country s call,
from the men of today, as there was
fifty years ago, and the mothers of to
day would still do as the mothers of
long ago. send their sons to the front
with a mother's blessing.
After Mr. Stewart s speech, "Amer
ica," was sung by the audience standing
and the benediction was pronounced
by uev. ueacn.
The ball game at City park became
the center of interest for the remainder
of the afternoon.
NOTES
Manv nennlft from k HiufAnr whn
have relatives lying In Elmwood cem
etery visited Yale on Decoration day.
Many faces of old-time residents were
seen on our streets that day. .
Business places and residences were
nicely decorated with ilags and bunt
ing in honor of the day and the Vet
erans still with us.
The cement walk in the. rpmotpr?
was certainly much appreciated on
Tuesday, especially with the grounds
so wet and muddy.
Saturday Morning Storm.
A heavy rain and electrical storm vie
ted this section early Saturday morning,
doing considerable damage. -The big
brick chimney of the Yale Milling Co's
plant was struck by a bolt of lightning
shattering the south-east corner quite
uaaiy. it was tne most nerce electrical
display we have had in some time. The
land throughout the country is covered
by a sheet of water and growing crops
have suffered to a considerable extent.
HOW APPENDICITIS
CAN BE PREVENTED
Yale people should know that a few
doses of simplo buckthorn bark glycer
ine, etc., as mixed in Adler-i-ka, often
relieve or prevent appendicitis. This
simple mixture removes such surpris
ing foul matter that ONE SPOONFUL
relieves almost AN Y CASE constipa
tion, sour stomach or gas. A short
treatment helps chronic stomach troub
le. Adler-i-ka has easiest and most
thorough action of anything we have
ever Bold. Grant llolden, druggist, ad

Last Day of School.
Hose (lOttsleibeti closed a very suc
cessful term of school in the Bidleman
district. On account of the wet con
dition of the woods the exercises were
held at the (jleaner hall. The hall is
equipped with tables, benches and dish
es, making it a very convenient place
for a Catherine of this kind. Dintier
was served to about eighty, also ice
cream and cake.
After the boys had dinner a matched
game of base ball was played. The
writer is not up on base ball phraseol
ogy or we would give the game a com
plete writeup. We understand the
score was 10 to 21 in favor of 10.
Prizes were given by the teacher as
follows:
Three-legged race Clare Thompson
aud Dale Kullock.
Hunning races Will Ovens, box of
chocolates; Alvery Collins, base ball;
Leon Bullock, bottle perfume; itutn
Bontrager, bottle perfume; Mary Phil
lips, book; Velma Bullock, yase.
Three-year-old race Myron Bullock
and Mary Donaldson. Myron won but
as he shared his sack of candy with
Mary she did not care for the honors.
Mrs. Woodard was an easy winner in
the married ladies' race and received a
cute little baby doll, which was cared
for by Mr. W. during the rest of the
afternoon.
Claude Armstrong won a toy umbrel
la in the married men's race and the
other fellows in the contest cast envious
eyes on him while he was resting with
ease under its cooling shade.
Uev. Bragg, in behalf of the school

Decoration Day Came at City Park Was
Best of Season. Large Crowd in
Attendance.
The nice sunshiny weather of Tues
day afternoon brought a record-break
ing crowd to City park to witness the
game of base ball scheduled between
the Y. II. S. and Emmett teams.
Coach Main had his bunch in the
finest condition and his presence on
the battlefield in fighting togs just
"Cabby" Was the Star
naturally made his team "hone" for
blood, and some of the "irregulars"
showed up so fine that they are now
sure of a regular "birth." With the
Beadle boys for a battery, and support
like the rest of the team gave them,
Yale could wipe almost any town off
the map.
The Emmett team was rather a
hyphenated affair, the visiting man
agement using many foreigners in the
line-up. Bricker and Dowd, star Btick-
artists from Avoca were in the game,
but neither seemed to come up to ex
pectations. Big "Jim," who has been
r?oAry
Back In '64 they used to consider it a
great honor to steal second. Jim LaForge
tried it on the youngsters Tuesday but was
nabbed by 20 feet. Our artist caught him
Just after he got up steam.
Emmett's initial sacker for nearly fifty
years was with us again, and his play
ing shows that farming agrees with
him. The only change we can see be
tween him now and the Jim of years
ago are the changes that come with
old age. He has the same sunny smile
but lacks his old "pep" and "ginger."
The visitors, to a man, were a good
natured, gentlemanly bunch, and took
