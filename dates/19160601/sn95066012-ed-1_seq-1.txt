Men and Women: Is Your Hair Lus
trous, Soft and Abundant
One bottle of Parisian Saga will
prove to any man or woman that dand

is no need of falling hair and that
scalp itch is unnecessary.
It is a delightful, refreshing, invigor
ating, harmless and Inexpensive liquid
that every druggist knows about and
speaks well of.
But one thing that has especially
made Parisian Sage famous is its pecu
liar power to turn harsh, unattractive
hair into luxuriant hair in a short time,
and women who desire fascinating hair
should not be without it.
V. L. Gokay guarantees it to do just
as advertised or money back, and he
sells lots of it.

Immediate Withdrawal of Ameri

OUR MOTIVES CHALLENGED
First
Chief Charges United States
Has Not Lived Up to
Declarations.
Mexico City, May 31. Asserting
that the words and protestations of
the United States have been entirely
in contradiction of its acts, and that,
in spite of protestations of non-intervention
in the affairs of Mexico, soldi
ers of the L'nited States are now in
Mexico without the consent of the
Mexican Government and in violation
of Mexico's sovereignty, the Mexican
Government now asks for the immediate-
withdrawal of those troops. The
request is made in a 12,000 word note
made public at the Foreign Oilice to
day. The note recites that the American
troops crossed the frontier after the
Columbus raid without the permission
of the Mexican Government. The act
was not considered one of invasion
then solely because the United Slates
said it had misinterpreted the atti
tude of the Mexican Government.
'The Mexican Government therefore
invites the United States to bring to
an end this tinsiippoitable situation,"
tho note concludes, ''and to support its
protestations and declarations of
friendship by an Immediate withdraw
al of the American troops."
'The American Government," it is
asserted, " has admitted that the work
of the expedition which entered after
the Columbus raid is now over. But
in spite of this fact American troops
still remain on Mexico soil. .To con
tend that political disorder In this
couutry justifies this act of the Ameri
can military forces is in conflict with
the repeated professions of the Wash
ington Government relative to non-in-
terierence,"

Paris Claims Kaieer's Army Has Been
Depleted 300,000 Men Since
February.
Herlin, June 1. The French have
been compelled to surrender all posi
tions on Uead Man hill, the last of the
defences northwest of Verdun. These
positions have been so completely torn
by the fire of the German artillery
that the French have been forced to
fail back.
Paris, June 1 The Germans have
thrown 75,000 fresh troops into the
fighting about Verdun; during the past
week, the war oilice announced today.
Since February fully a million Ger
mans have gathered on the Verdun
front and the estimated losses In killed
wounded and missing are placed at
30l',000.
London, May 31. Attacks on the
west bank of the Meuse, described In
the French official reports1 as of a most
violeut character have given the Ger
mans a little more ground in their
great battle for Verdun. These great
infantry charges extended from Dead
Man Hill east to the Meuse and were
successful in the Caurrtto Wood. Here
the Paris War oilice admits the French
were forced to retire from the first
line trench which had previously been
leveled by artillery fire "of unheard-of
violence."
Against this loss, the French report
tonight the capture of a strong Ger
man position to tho eouthwest ot Lo
Mort Homme. The French took 220
prisoners here, including nvu otuccrs,
and seven machine guns.
Further German activity on this
front Is Indicated by thei-French report
of German attempts lo debouch from
Cumieres toward Chattanconrt. Some
of these attempts were at first success'
ful. but the French report asserts that
the Germans were eventually forced
back to the village, certain groups who
took advantage of a fog to advance to
Chattanconrt being wiped out by
French guns.

on the rest of the Verdun front.

WILSON'S "WEASEL" WORDS
President's Memorial Day Address
Contained Too Many Qualifying
Phrazes.
St. Louis, Mo., June 1 Theodore
Koosevelt made three speeches in this
city yesterday in which he advocated
universal military service, declared
the German-American alliance was
guilty of moral treason and anti-Americanism
and denounced President Wil
son's Memorial day speech as weak.
Cheering crowds greeted him.
Mr. Roosevelt maintained that Pres
ident Wilson used "weasel'' words
which sucked the life out of his
phrases and made them meaningless.
'When Mr. Wilson speaks of 'univer
sal voluntary training,' " he asserted,
"he draws a parallel to a truancy law
which would make universal attend
ance by children at school obligatory
to all except those who wanted to keep
away.
Mr. Roosevelt addressed the largest
crowd at the City club in the after
noon, where he said that neutrality
that allowed trampling on American
rights could not be tolerated, and that
there could be no Americans who were
not Americana to the heart. "I de
nounce the German-American alliance
with all my soul." he shouted. "The
acts of its leaders constitute moral
treason to our government and our
people."
Moral treason to the United States
was charged by Col. Roosevelt against
German-Americans who seek to.mako
their governmental representatives
act in the interests of Germany rather
than this country. He characterized
the German-American alliance as "an
anti-Americun alliance," but added
that ho believed that its members "not
only do not represent but scandalously
misrepresent" the great majority of
real Americans of German origin.
Crging the motto "America for
Americans" for all Americans whether
they weie born here or abroad, the
former president declared that "the
salvation of our people lies in having
a nationalized and unified America,
ready for the tremendous tasks of both
war and peace." "I appeal to all our
citizens, the colonel said, no matter
from what land their forefathers came
to keej) tills ever in mind, and to slum
with scorn and contempt the sinister
intriguers and mischief-makers who
would seek to divide them along lines
of creed, of birthplace or of national
origin."

PLEA FOR MEMORIAL DAY
Veterans Deserve Our Assistance Now
as Never Before. ,
Editor of The Banner: Another
year has passed swiftly away, bearing
with it once more that most1 sacred of
all our national holidays, Memorial
day, and it seems fitting that, through
the columns of the Banner, a few
words be said in regards to its mean
ing and its observance.
It was my privilege to be with the
patriotic organizations, and have a
small part in the duties of the day,
and I observed several incidents
worthy of note.
In a recent issue of the Banner you
stated that at present the local Grand
Army post numbered but forty mem
bers, cf whom thirty were expected to 1
be present and take part in the exer
cises of the day. As a matter of fact,
22 veterans only were seated at the
dinner, served at 11:30 by the Wo
men's Relief Corps, and the number
present was a sad reminder of the
rapid decrease in the membership of
our post, as well as of the fact now Is
the time for manifesting our patriot
ism as citizens of our town in the
honor and care we bestowe upon the
men to whom we owe a debt which
can never be paid.
Present ut dinner and at the exer
cises which followed was an aged vet
eran, Dexter M. Camp of western Kan
sas. Mr. Camp was born in Benning
ton in 1832, but left Vermont early in
life and located in Illinois where at
the outbreak of the war of the rebel
lion, he enlisted in the 47th Illinois
which was a part of the 15th corps.
He served faithfully during our
country's struggle and at the close
located in western Kansas, his present
home. He is a cousin of II. G. Camp
of this town und both veterans were
in G. A. H. hall, neither knowing the
others presence u;.'il told by com
rades after which they greatly enjoyed
their first meeting after a lapse of
nearly sixty years. Mr. Camp's youth
ful courage was fully demonstrated in
his long trip to visit his native town
at such an advanced age.
Great credit is due the organizations
of the town who took part in the duties
of the day, especially the Sons of Vet
crams, upon whom the sacred duties of
the day must soon devolve. About 30
of the Sons were present and did all in
their power to lighten the labors and
increase the pleasure of the day for
the veterans.
The Boy Scouts of whom about 15
were in line, and the children from our
schools, of whom there were about CO,
also deserve mention, as both added to
the beauty cf the parade. ,
While standing in the cemetery "at
the soldiers' home,' looking into the
faces of our veterans and noting the
absence of many who were present
one year ago. but have since been
mustered in" to the greater Grand
Army, I could not refrain from think
ing whether we us a community real
ize what an honor and privilege is
ours in having these men In our midst.
or how brief must be the time until
these also will rest from these labors
and only Memorial day itself remain
for us to honoY. It would seem that
did we realize in full the meaning of
these things, no tribute we could give
no sacrifice we could make, no addi
tional honor we could bestow now
would be delayed or seem too much
for us to do. May we not each one
make a greater effort to make each
remaining Memorial day more beautl
ful and holy for those who yet remain
with us, asking in return only Urn
pleasure which such service rendered
should give to every true American
man and woman.
Yours in the spirit of the day,
Hntli England Smith,

and his party would join It after cross

sent year the Aurora returned to Port
Chalmers, N. 'A., having broken adrift

panions at the Ross sea base. Port
Stanley is the capital of the Falkland
islands, which lie in the south Atlan
tic, off the seacoast of Argentina.
