Mayordomo Frank Gallegos.for
San Juan Day is around seeing
! what he can do towards getting
funds for the celebration of the
above named day. He informs
us that all the business houses,
but one have come through ex
ceptionally well. Frank is going
to make things go anyway. He
says that one business house can't
possibly stop the celebration, and
that he knows who will be the
loser in the long run. It is wond
erful how short sighted some
men are. Some of them never
want to spend a dollar to help
anything along but are always
wanting everything to come to
them how can they expect it
when they never put a dollar out.
And when they do try to do
something they seem to think
that they are doing you a great
favor. Most business men can
see far enough ahead to know
that if they put cut a little
money for a public enterprise or
public celebration, it will return
to them five folds or moi e and
they also consider it a good in
vestment. Come, loosen up and
lets have a big celebration on
June 24th. Advertise it far and
near.

The Forest Fire
Fighters
The fire patrolmen and lookout
men on the Apache National For
est are having a difficult time of
it this year. What with snow,
rain, sleet and hurricane gales,
life on the mountains (and espec
ially upon exposed lookout points)
is not so much of a pleasant exist
ance as is often imagined. Last
week on May 24, the Forest office
at Springerville was notified by
the Phoenix Weather Bureau to
be on the lookout for a gale. As
a matter of fact, the gale arrived
before the warning. In addition
to a veritable hurricane, the
weather wasfreezingcold and yet,
it was absolutely necessary for
the lookout and patrolmen to be
at their stations. As the lookout
man (F. L. Maxwell) at Pat Knoll
tower telephoned into the Super
visor's office "I'm a riding her,
but she's bucking like a bronco!"
While the wind was at its height,
two Forest officers (Messrs. Ellis
Lund and Guy B. Rencher of
Eagar, Arizona) were making
desperate efforts to extinguish
fires which had broken out at
widely different points on the
Forest and both succeeded in con
fining the fires to seven or eight
acres with the help of nearby
stockmen and farmers. On the
same day, Mr. J. S. Martin, of
Nutrioso extinguished an incipi
ent forest fire which might have
caused, untold damage-. - -
Because of this constant vigil
ance upon the part of the Forest
officers and Forest users, the
great danger from forest fires is
being reduced each year but let
no one imagine that the life of
the average patrolman or lookout
man on the White Mountains and
Blue Range is one of unalloyed
ease.
Forethought.
People are learning that a little
forethought often saves them a
big expense. Here is an instance:
E. W. Archer, Caldwell, Ohio,
writes: "I do not believe that our
family has been without Cham
berlain's Colic, Cholera and
'Diarrhoea -Remedy since we com
menced keeping house years ago.
. When we go on an extended
visit we take it with us. " Obtain
able everywhere. Adv.

mass meeting for the purpose of

Stomach Troubles and Constipation.

years' drugstore service," writes
