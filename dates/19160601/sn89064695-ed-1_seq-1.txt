SUBSCRIPTION: S1.50P ER YEAR IN ADVANCE
FOR UNITED STATES
SENATOR MOSES
E,
The Chippewa voters need not
be urged by anyone to vote for
Senator Clapp, and those who wish
to continue to have Indian matters
proceed towards a final settlement
are only anxious that tlK3se
shall
bear in mind their obligations to
the senator and take a day off by
UNITED STATES SENATOR,
MOSES E. CLAPP.
coming to the polls and voting for
him at the primary election on the
19th of this month.
liapid strides are being made by
the Chippewas toward* a final set
tlement of their matters, much
more so and effectively than
those of any other tribe in the
country, and this can be seen dur
ing the sessions of 0 mjjreba when
the Indian bill is up for discussion
before the committees on Indian
affairs in Congress.
This is all due to the interest
Senator Clapp takes in Chippewa
Indian tnatters.
Without Senator Clapp in
thePortage,
United States Senate the affairs of
not only his white constituents,
but also those of the Indians would
suffer.
Senator Clapp himself is not
working actively for his re-election
but is leaving this entirely with
the voters, while his opponents are
Xsparing no time nor money in their
efforts to secure their election. If
Senator Clapu is nominated, re
garding which there seems to be
no doubt, it will be through the
wishes of the voters and not
through the influence money.
Minnesota's "Live Wire."
Kepresentative Scott Ferris, of
Oklahoma, who is an ardent Dem
ocrat. referred to Congressman
Clarence Miller, a Republican of
Duluth, in our presence as a "live
wire."
Mr. Ferris was not mistaken in
the impression he had formed of
Mr. Milier, for the latter is a ver
itable live wire in Congress where
he is apparently one of the most
^prominent figures.
Mr. Miller is a strong man in
Coivgre*s suid the position he fills
there cannot Ixt replaced by anymissionerof
ordinary, inex.jerier.ced person.
When he arises to speak he al-Indian
sray* has something to say, and
-it*"*'
says it in the most forcible and
unequivocal manner, and for this
reason he is listened to attentively
93T
the House.
Although Representative Miller
is always on the alert in behalf of
the interests of his district general
ly, he finds time to intercede for
Indian constituents frequently,
or whenever their matters come
before Congress,
From his personal observation
Mr. Miller knows that Chippewa
tribal funds have been squandered
in the p-ist, and during the present
session of Congress his voice was
raised very strenously against this
on the fijor of the House.
Mr. Miller is a credit to Minne
sota, and there .should be no
thought of superseding him by an
inexperienced and unknown per
son, therefore the Chippewas in
whose behalf he has stood, many
of whom are voters in his district,
should do a good day's work by
coming to the polls a.id voting for
him at the primary election.
Far Reaching Effect.
The work of the Chippewa dele
gates that were appointed by Presi
dent Morrison of the General
Council of Minuesota Ohippewas
to go to Washington last winter,
will probably be of more import
ance not only to the Chippewas of
this state but also to the white set
tlers upon this reservation as fu
ture events will no doubt demon
strate. This statement is made as
a prediction, and in the future we
will call further attention to it.
Probably the most important
work that the delegation accom
plished was in having inserted into
the Indian appropriation act thegood
amendment which provides that
preference shall be given to mem
bers of the Chippewa tribe as
permanent employes in the Chip
pewa Indiau service, where the
salaries are paid from Chippewa
tribal funds.
The positions which can now be
filled by members of the Chippe
wa tribe under the new law arethat
the superintendent of logging, now
filled by William O'Neil, and alllisle
his assistants including scalers, the
superintendents of the WThite
Earth, Red Lake, Leech Lake,
C.iss Lake, Fond du Lac, Grand
Vermillion Lake and Nett
Lake reservations and all the
emMay
ployes under them.
When it is taken into considera
ti ^n that sixty thousand dollars
and a portion of the interest on
tribal funis may be used during
the fiscal year commencing July
let next for salaries alone, the
amendment means much to those
who are competent to fill the posi
tions.
Furthermore, the amendment as
was intended by its authors will
not enable the Indian office, if it
should desire to do so, to keep the
members of the tribe from obtain
ing the positions upon technical
objections, such as not being in
the classified service, as long as
they can by competent evidence
show that they can fill the posi
tions.
It is not believed that a strict
construction of existing laws have
been followed in placing in the
classified government service em
ployes- who are in fact iG the Chip
pewa Indian service and who are
receiving their salaries from Chip
pewa tribal funds and notfrom'

their salaries are turned over to

until they graduate. Thus it will
be seen that Mr. Ford is doing as
much for Indian boys as is the
government.
Mr. Ford is quoted as saying
he will place no limit upon
the number of boys from the Car
school who may wish to work
at his factory, and the only condi
tion that will be required of them
is that they will abstain from the
use of intoxicants entirely.

Miss Anna Fairbanks has made
application for the south half of
the south-east quarter of section
twenty-two, township one hundred
and forty one, range forty one, as
n additional allotment under the
Steenerson Act and which is a
part of the tract for which Mr.
Steenerson recently introduced a
bill in Congress to set aside for
public school purposes.
Some interesting questions may
arise under Miss Fairbanks' ap
plication for the land, but it seems
reasonable that she is entitled to
the tract since it is no longer re

salaries from tribal funds.
Hereafter the position of the
president of the ChippewaGeueral
Council will be one of much more
importance than it has been and
likewise the council itself since no
doubt it will be the source through
which appointments in the Chip
pewa Indian service will be apwards
proved.
Another important provision
which the delegates had inserted
in the appropriation act this year
is one which provides that the In
dian office shall give a detailed,
itemized statement regarding the
manner in which Chippewa tribal
funds appropriated by Congress
this year have been expended.
This provision was included in the
Nelson Act but has never been ob
served.

'Truth before Favor,
Senator Walsh Is Right.
At a recent meeting of the In
dian committee of the Senate at
Washington, Senator Walsh, of
Montana, in an emphatic manner
declared what in his opinion should
be the government's policy to
the Indians. He stated
that in 1880 President Hays rec
ommended that Indians should re
ceive lands in severalty, and that
the surplus lands of reservations
should bo sold for their benefit
that this in fact had been the ex
pressed policy of the government
since then and that Congress hud
enacted laws with this in view, but
some administrative officials had
not put this into effect. He also
stated that it was detrimental to
the Indians themselves to be kept
in idleness and to be dependent
upon the government for a living
that they should be placed upon
their own resources as fast as pos
sible.
Every progressive Indian will
agree with Senator Walsh's senti
ments, and representatives of In
dian tribes who visit Washington
year after year should learn that
by representing to Congress that
their people are in a starving con
ditiou is not a credit to their
To represent that acer
tain tribe of Indians is in a desti
tute and starving condition is sel
dom true, and it is time that for
the pride of the race such state
menjs should cease.
The greatest solution of the In

dians to be compelled to work out
their own salvatiou by labor if
necessary.

Indians Protest Use Of Minnesota Man's
Name For Mountain.
Secretary of the Interior Frank
lin K. Lane recently received a
petition from the Blackfeet In
dians of western Montana protest
ing against the naming of a moun
tain peak and waterfall in Glacier
National park in honor of Profes
sor F. M. Lehnerts of the Univer
sity of Minnesota and his daugh
ter.
The protest, a dispatch from
Washington to The Journal said,
is part of a general one covering
the alleged pructice of white men
changing Indian names to names
of white tourists or explorers

1S98. The cowboys and settlers
around ihere named it after me.
"If the peak had really had an
Indian name, it would have been a
shame to change it. But it- was so
nearly accessible that the Indians
never bothered with it. There
are 50 peaks in and about there
without names, or at least that
was the case a few years ago.
Those Indian names have been
given by white men with a knowl
edge of the value of romance with
in the last six years.
"I don't care if they want to
change the name of the peak. Let
them call it 'Almost a-dog' or Rain-

to. The peak will be the same.
