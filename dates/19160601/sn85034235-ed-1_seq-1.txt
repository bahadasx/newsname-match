A TALE OF'
RED ROSES
By
GEORGE
RANDOLPH
CHESTER
Copyright, 1914. by the Bobbs
Merriil Co.
Sledge walked into Marley's offic;
with his parlor smile, the recently out
lived one which belonged of right to
the red rose he wore, and he sat down
before lie began to speak. Ilis usual
method was to deliver his messages
standing.
"We ought to figure a consolidation,"
lie suggested.
Marley considered that statement
carefully. He was beginning to learn
that lie really needed caution in deal
in. g with Sledge.
"One of us might be gobbled up." ho
sagely concluded. "As I understand it.
you own 75 per cent of the new com
pany, while 1 only hold a bare majority
of the old one. It would scarcely be
possible that in a consolidation I would
still have control."
"We'd have to pool our stock for
either one to hold it," agreed Sledge.
Marley looked at him wonderingl.v.
"I don't quite understand the advan
tage to you in this." ho puzzled. "Frank
ly, Mr. Sledge, I'd have lo see that ad
vantage before I could consider tho
matter."
"There ain't any," Sledge confessed.
"I want to protect you if everything's
all right. Molly was just over."
"Yes; she said she was going to see
you," replied Marley. clutching eager
ly at the straw.
■ i thought she'd get enough," stated
Sledge, and he chuckled. "She's a
smart girl."
"Yes; she is," assented Marley. won
dering just how much she had said to
mate such a remarkable change in
Sledge. "A consolidation would proba
bly be a very sensible thing. It would
enable us to plan extensions, lines and
loops which would increase our reve
nues tremendously, with no possibility
of dividing the patronage. Moreover,
a mere announcement of such a move
uould add immediately to the market
value of the stock in both companies."
"We consolidate after the marriage."
amended Sledge. "We get all ready
now."
"Any time you say," readily consent
ed Marley. "I'll meet with you and ar
range the details tonight."
"Xaw!" refused Sledge. "Theater to
night."
"With Molly?" inquired Marley,
wanting to smile.
"Molly and Fern. Fern's a nice kid."
"All right; tomorrow night, then,"
suggested Marley. his mind firmly
fixed on the commercial opportunity.
"Daytime." corrected Sledge. "I'm
busy nights. Say. Marley, is that game
between Molly and Bert called clear
off?"
"Did Molly say so?" evaded Marley.
"No," Sledge hesitated. "Is it?"
"That's entirely Molly's affair."
"I believe you." coincided Sledge, and
again he chuckled as he arose to go.
"Is there any objection to giving out
a hint of this consolidation?" asked
Marley, with an instant thought that
ni the very least this new turn would
enhance his price with the syndicate
which had proposed to buy him out.
"IlHTib-uh!" assented Sledge. "You
better see Davis about your mortgage.
He won't extend, but he'll hold off."
"I'll go over right away," answered
Marley. anxious to take advantage of
that ofTer also as quickly as possible.
"Wait til! tomorrow." ordered Sledge
arid stalked out. having but very little
time to waste.
His way lay directly past the Grand
Opera House, and be stopped at the
ticket window.
"Give me a box for tonight." he
grunted.
"Thanks!"' grunted Sledge and stuffed
the tickets in his pocket.
"Don't mention it." returned the
treasurer as nonchalantly and walked
back to the manager of the company.
"What kind or a show is this?" asked
Sledge.
"Rotten!" the ticket man informed
him. "It s highbrow stuff, 'Hamlet.' "
"Iluub!" grunted Sledge. "Any mu
sic?"
"Orchestra. Ophelia sings, but you'd
think she was having her teeth fixed."
"Huiili!" observed Sledge again, and
walked out.
Two blocks up the street, on bis way
to tlie Occident, he stopped at an auto
mobile salesroom.
"This working?" he inquired, point
ing to the shining big limousine which
occupied the center of the floor.
"All it needs is gasoline," replied the
salesman.
•Tut some red roses in that flower
thing, and send it up,'' Sledge directed.
"About dinner time?" surmised the
salesman. "Possibly I'd better send it
up before, Mr. Sledge. It has some im
provements your man might want to
look into."
"I'll send Billy down," decided
Sledge.
He turned to go when, in the ad
joining window, he caught sight of a
little, low, colonial coupe, with seating
capacity for three. It was of an ex
quisitolv beautiful shape, with small,
latticed window panes and dainty lace
curtains. He walked slowly toward
it, ids habitually cold gray eyes bright
ening, and as be stood before it he
thrust his hands deep Mr his tickets
and positively laughed aloud.
"That's our newest ladies' car," ex
plained tho salesman, following him.
"The women arc crazy about them.
Self starting, electric lights inside,
shopping flaps everywhere, adjustable
satin seat coverings and nil tbe latest
boudoir improvements."
Sledge scarcely heard him. He was
still laughing. Nothing he had ever
seen had struck him so humorously as
tlie "cuteness" of this car.
"It's swell!" he chuckled. "Got n
red one?"
"No. they're only made in black,"
the salesman told him. "The color ef
fects are obtained by thç cushion cov
erings and silk curtains."
"Put red ones in this., Got another
one?" -
"There's one just being set up in the
shop," stated the overjoyed salesman.
"It's an order."
"Make that one blue." **
"Do you want them tills afternoon?"
asked the clerk, figuring that it was
worth while to put off the other eus
tomer.
"Sure!" said Sledge. "Right away."
"I'll get busy immediately," promised
the salesman, delirious with happiness.
"Where do they go?" *
"Molly Marley gets the red one. The
blue one's for her friend {Tern. Nix on
who sent 'em."
"They'll want to know," the sales
man insisted.
"Aw, tell 'em Frank Marley."
Just across the street was the largest
jewelry shop in town, ami the display
in its windows gave him an idea. He
strode in. asked for the proprietor and
got him.
"I want a rock that wèigbs about n
pound," lie stated. # <
"A diamond? Y'es, Mr. Sledge. Some
thing for an emblem?" *>
"Naw! Lady's ring—soBtaire."
"We have some boautjps,'* 1 bragged
the jeweler, immediately* aglow with
enthusiasm. "Here is n nice little
three carat stone which isiflawless and
perfectly cut." 4
"Is this the best you got?" inquired
Sledge, looking into the ca^se. *
"Wo have some larger ones unset,
but they are not usually^ mounted in
ladies' rings," responded Tbe jeweler,
struggling between his Jirtlstic con
science and Ids commeroiqSism.
"Let's see 'em."
Reverently the jeweler produced from
his safe a covered and locked tray, in
which on white velvet reposed a dozen
sparkling white stones. f
Siedge poked a stuffy forefinger at
the largest one.
"Is this one right?" bq wanted to
know* '
"It's a very good stone." the jeweler
told him.
"The next one to it, however, though
a trifle smaller, is of much finer qual
ity. In fact, we have not one in the
shop of any size which I consider so
perfect as this one. It's worth $500
more than the large one."
"That'll do," Sledge decided. 'Tut it
in a ring.''
"Very well," agreed the jeweler, try
ing to be nonchalant as he consulted a
slip of paper in the edge of the tray.
"This one weighs six and three-eighths
carats, plus a sixteenth, Mr. Sledge
•Have you the size of the ring?"
"Naw!" he returned in disgust at his
own thoughtlessness. "I'll take it
loose." And he slipped the stone in his
waistcoat pocket.

CHAPTER XIV.
Molly Insists on Protecting Bert.
BUT GLIDER strode through
tlie Marley gate and trod on
the Marley i>oreh and punched
the Marley doorbell in a fine
condition of manly indignation, and he
demanded of the emaciated Initier with
the intellectual brow that Molly Mar
ley be brought into his presence at
once. He waited in the library while
the butler went upstairs with that
hasty message, and it was no comfort
lo his soul whatsoever to hear the girls
devoting painstaking attention to an
apparently endless job of giggling.
With scant consideration for the im
portance of the occasion. Molly, her
face flushed and her eyes glistening
with moisture from her recent earnest
efforts, came down when she was
ready, and she was still tittering, while
Fern, upstairs, could be heard in tho
throes of frantic laughter.
"Hello, Bert." laughed Molly, holding
her hand to her jaw, and she sat down
weakly. "What's the mad rush?"
"What did you say to Sledge?" he
st-*nily demanded.
Her most immediate reply to that
was another half hysterical outburst.
"I'm not quite sure," she giggled.
"Fern and I have just, been trying to
recall it all, but we can only remember
tlie funniest things."
"You've made a fool of him and of
me!" charged Bert notly.
"We don't deserve any credit for
that," snickered Molly. "It's so easy."
"The man has taken too much for
granted," went on Bert, unsoftened by
(il this hilarity and, indeed, made ouly
more indignant by it. "From what
your father says, Sledge seems to be
lieve that our engagement is off and
that he has been practically accepted.'
Molly put her hand over her mouth
to suppress a shriek and, running out
into tlie hall, called Fern. The girls
met halfway up the stairway, where
Molly explained the glad news, and
Bert, stalking stolidiy ont there, found
them holding to the balustrade in order
that their enjoyment of Sledge's ob
tuse understanding might not tumblo
them down the stei*«- He strode back
into the library and barked his shin ou
a rocker. Molly returned to him pres
ently for more.
'Tve been missing my red roses,"
she confessed. "Now I suppose Hi
get some more. What else does he
think?"
"Heaven knows," snapped Bert, "lie
says he's going to the theater with
you tonight Is that correct?"
Molly gleefully nodded her head.
"Did you forget that you were going
to the club dance with me?" he indig
nantly went on, feeling like shaking
her.
This time Molly shook her head, her
eyes gleaming with devilment ana
from Fern, still on the stairway, there
arose a wild peal.
Bert closed the library doors.
"I forbid it," he commanded.
The change in Molly was so abrupt
that it startled him into barking his
other shin. First of all she threw open
the library doors, knowing, however,
that Fern by this time was back in tne
boudoir.
"You may do your forbidding to Mr.
Sledge." she told him, with blazing
eyes. "You were thoughtful enough
to consider seriously sending me to
him, and now whatever follows is up
to me. I am going to the theater to
night with Mr. Sledge."
"Molly, Molly, Molly!" shrieked Fern,
half running and half bumping down
the stairs. "Run to the window, quick,
and see the parade! O-o-o-oh! It's
coming here!"
Molly laid aside her just indignation
for a moment, feeling intuitively that
a Sledge miracle was some place lit
the neighborhood, and glanced out of
the window, as Fern, gurgling Inco
herently, flashed by on her way to the
door.
Up the winding driveway, one fol
lowing the other, were two of tbe
most beautiful little colonial coupes
in the world, such cars as would make
any girl go stark howling mad with
ecstasy. They were exactly alike, ex
cept that the one in front was hung

with lace and fihny red silk curtains,
and the other had blue with its fluffy
white. Both the cars were empty, ex
cept for the hard featured men who
were driving thèm, looking as much
out of place as a coni heaver in a lin
gerie bonnet
"The blue one's mine!" exclaimed
Fern, dancing up and down in a de
lirium of joy as Molly joined lier a!
the door, through the hangings of
which the girls now peered out in
frantic impatience.
I wonder what brings them here?"
speculated Molly, dreading the worst
"I don't care!" returned Fern. "That
blue car's mine, and I know it Molly,
do you really suppose it could bo a
present?"
"Certainly not" decided Molly
promptly. "Oh. but aren't they ex
quisite?"
Exquisite? They're the dearest,
sweetest, darlingcst little things I ever
saw!" cried Fern. "The only thing
that's missing is that there should be a
band leading them. Say, Molly," and
berc she sank her voice to a giggling
whisper, "I'll bet you that Sledge"—
"Certainly not!" interrupted Molly,
almost fiercely, and then she. too, gig
gled. and tiie two girls scattered away
from the door as the chauffeur of the
rcîl car who was the gentlemanly sales
man in disguise, dismounted and came
slowly up to the door.
They waited in the library with the
frowning and bewildered Bert while
the thin butler with the tall brow an
swered the bell, and they distinctly
heard the chauffeur ask for Miss Mar
ley and Miss Burbank. They waited in
half frightened decorum while the thin
butler solemnly brought that message,
and then, with no more trace of excite
ment than if they had been dragged
away' from a tiresome French lesson,
they walked sedately into tho hall.
"Miss Marley?" observed that person,
nodding to the right girl. "I have the
pleasure of bringing out a very beauti
ful little gift to yourself and Miss Bur
bank," and here he nodded to the other
young lady, who was holding her toes
to the floor by gripping them. "The
red lined one is for Miss Marley and
the blue one for Miss Burbank."
"I said the blue one was mine!" half
shrieked Fern, unable to contain her
self any longer. "I want to ride in it—
now!"
Molly looked longingly past the per
son's shoulder out. at the red curtained
car, and she felt that sick, sick seiisa
tion of self abnegation clamoring
within.
"Who sent them?" she asked faintly.

"Your father," replied the conscience
less salesman, looking her more clearly
in the eye than any honest man could
have done. "If you have the time wo
shall bo pleased to give you a lesson in
running them."
Fern was halfway upstairs.
"Do you want your gray coat or yonr
furs, Molly?" she called as she went
"Something light," replied Molly,
equally excited, running out to inspect
the ear, with the gentlemanly salesman
right at her elbow and highly pleased
with his job. The chauffeur in the
Mue ear waited with bright eyes.
Fern, followed by Mina and another
maid, both of them too slow to be of
any service, came clattering on the
porch with two afternoon coats and
two bonnets selected with less discrim
ination than she had ever used and
tossed any of them to Molly. "I'll bet
it was Sledge," she whispered as she
ran and popped into the blue car.
Her coupe was the first to whirl
down the driveway, but the red one
followed iu close order. Bert stood on
the edge of the porch, with his hands
rammed in his pockets, and watched
the end of the world. Being a young
■man of keen thought, however, after
fifteen minutes of numbness he curled
his mustache, took up the telephone
and called Frank Marley.
"Did you make a present of two au
tomobiles to the girls?" he inquired.
"Did I what?" gasped Marley out of
the midst of his plans for making the
proposed street car consolidation worth
twenty points' advance ou his stock to
the up state syndicate.
"I thought not," returned Bert, with
a very near approach to profanity. "I
didn't think you'd weaken our capital
by a $5.000 extravagance of that sort
"I don't understand you." puzzled
Marley.
"Two small inclosed cars came out
here about fifteen minutes ago, and
tue man in charge of them said that
you sent them. Personally I think
Sledge has been getting fresh."
"It's barely possible," agreed Marley,
feeling a dangerous indignation rising
within him. "Leave that to inc, Bert.
As Molly's father it is my affair. I'll
investigate it at once."
Palpitating with all a righteous fa
ther's jealous care, Frank Marley kept
the telephone busy until he located
Sledge.
"I say, Sledge," he blurted. "Did you
send out a couple of automobiles to
my house?"
"Naw, Marley," chuckled Sledge.
"They're toys. You sent 'em. Do they
like 'em?"
"I haven't inquired," returned Mar
ley, still standing by his father's dig
nity. "Really* Mr. Sledge, you know
I can't allow my daughter to receive
extravagant presents of that sort from
any one other than myself.®"'"" ~
"Aw, cut it," advised Sledge. "I get
you. If they don't like 'em. I'm the
goat If they do, close your trap. You
sent 'em."
"Well, but"—
"I say you sent 'em," insisted Sledge,
with a gruff loss of his cordiality,
which had been apparent in bis former
tones, and Marley heard the click of
disconnection.
Nearly an hour later two shining lit
tle colonial coupes, the red curtained
one in front, drove tip to the Marley
porch, where Bert Glider gloomed in
the doorway. They were driven by a
happy girl each and had no other oc
cupants.
"Come and take a ride with me,
Bert," hailed Molly, so full of delight
that she had absolutely forgotten he;
quarrel with him, which was a blow
indeed." "You can't drive, though."
Fern had emerged from her car.
"I'm going to have my dinner he. .''
»lie laughingly announced. "I think »
shall go to the theater tonight in mine.
Jump'in Molly's car, Bert, and try iL
It rides like a rocking chair."
"No, thank you!" returned Bert com
ly. "Those cars are going hack to the
salesroom. I felt sure that your fa
ther had not given them to you, after
our business arrangement of this morn
ing. They are a present from Sledge."
"Oh, please, no!" pleaded Molly, with
a heartsick glance at lier red curtain
ed car. She had loved it at sight, but
now, since she had learned to know it,
she adored it "How do you know that
they are from Sledge?"
"I suspected it from the beginning,
he sternly informed her. "So I called
up your father."
"I said they were from Sledge!" c.'«
Fern. "Molly, it was awfully erud. .1
him, but I love 1dm for it-don't you?"
"What did father say?" demanded
Molly.
"He is investigating."
Molly marched straight to the tele
phone und called up her father. He
talked to her kindly, wisely and with
deliberation, also like a man who had
given himself plenty of time for
thought. Bert stood at her elbow, lis
tening to one side of the conversation
and piecing out the other with painful
ly knotted Intellect. Molly turned to
him with calm satisfaction.
"Father says that I am to consider
the cars as a gift from him," she pride
fully announced.
Fern executed the full figures of a
minuet and sang a merry tra-la-la all
the way through. Molly helped her
sing and dance the last figure.
"Three cheers!" she exulted. "Now
we may keep our cars."
"I never intended to give mine up,"
Fern affirmed.
Bert walked Molly back into her
father's den.
"I have nothing to saj - about what
Fern does," he firmly announced, "but
I have something to say about your
conduct. You can't shut your eyes to
the fact that pledge has given you this
car, and he has no right to do so."
"My father says that I am to con
sider the car as a gift from him," re
peated Molly primly, but with a snap
in her eyes.
"That is only an evasion," Bert in
sisted. "You have willfully misled
Sledge into tho belief that you lntena
to put yourself in the position of re
ceiving presents from him, and either
this thing must be stopped or there will
be unpleasantness between you and
me."
'There is one way we can liead_that
off." Molly quietly assured him. "We
can break our engagement."
"Impossible!" immediately declared
Bert, frightened. "I didn't mean any
thing like that, Molly," and he attempt
ed to take her hands and perform a
lbtle of the lovemaking which lie had
rather neglected.
I mean it, though," she insisted,
drawing her hands away from him.
"Our engagement has only brought
trouble to everybody concerned and
has subjected me to more than one in
sult which I had no right to expect.
If we declare it off botli you and fa
ther cau go right back to where you
were in a business way."
"It's too late for that," he assured
her, sitting down to reason it out with
her on the commercial plane since she
scorned to insist upon it "I could
never regain the political friendship
which is necessary to my style of busi
ness. My commercial career iu this
city is at an end, and my social stand
ing would be also. Knowing this, I
have been in correspondence with my
people in Baltimore. They have a
magnificent business opening there for
me, but it takes $100,000 to obtain con
trol of it. I laid the matter before
your father, and ho investigated it
Our conclusion is tliis—if we can close
up our business satisfactorily here and
he can sell this place we shall have in
the neighborhood of $150,000 clear be
tween us. You and I are to marry, go
to Maryland with your father, enter
into business and take up the social
position to which we are entitled.
When I take you there as my bride.
Molly, everybody's going to be very
proud of you. and I am quite sure that
you will like the social atmosphere
there much better than here. I've
dwelt on this so often to you that it
must seem like an old story, and yet
this Is the first time that it has seemed
very near to us."
Molly felt herself wondering why
this glittering promise failed to thrill
tier as It had used to do.
"I'll be tlie proudest Glider that was
ever in the family when I can take yon
home as my wife." he went on. "It's
atl cut and dried. Molly, and we ex
pect to have everything closed up be
fore our wedding day if we can hold
Sledge off that long."
"And yet you scold me for helping
you hold Sledge off when you couldn't
do it yourselves," she retorted. "Why.
yon actually suggested to me that I
should see what I could do with him."
"I don't like the way you're going
about it." he confessed.
"You should lie proud of me," she re
proved him. "I think that Fern and I
have done a beautiful job of it," and
she began laughing. "We're going to
put on our very best frocks tonight and
be a credit to you. You're ungrateful."
and she began to look indignant again.
"Let's forget it." offered Bert, laugh
ing, and took her In his arms. "You're
the girl for me, Molly, and there won't
be any more envied couple in Maryland
than we."
He kissed her and held her while he
talked to her of the social triumphs
which awaited them, the topic which
had always pleased her most in their
plans for the future. After all, they
would make a splendidly matched cou
ple. Moreover, she did owe It to her
father and Bert to give them another
business start
