San Francisco, Juno 1. Promptly at
C a. m. today ten thousand lougshore
inen at every American port on the
Pacific coast quit work. Activity vir
tuilly halted on San Francisco 's water
front, as well as on the docks of Sc
uttle, Portland, Tacomn, Oakland, San
Diego, Los Angeles and many other
Cities.
The strike was called by the Riggers
find Stevedores union and the flay aud
Jiivcr Steamboatmen ' union because
employers would not agree to wage in
crease demands which have been urged
for several weeks. Employers assert
there demands, if granted, would neces
sitate a 30 per cent raise in pay. They
claim they arc financially un ible to
meet suon a condition.
Representatives of tho shippers arc
roticent concerning the report that
t'r.ey will import strikebreakers. It is
understood that leading employers are
ptrongly opposed to such a move if It
can possibly bo avoided.
All shipping is. affected by the strike
with the exception of ferry boats on
Ban Francisco b.iy and such vessels
a.i can handle thei' cargoes w'tih their
own de.'k hand. Some of the lines
hardest hit by the walkout are .tho
Mutaon Navigation comin;.y. the .met
iean-IIawai'un company, the Pacific
Mail, the Oceanic Steamship company,
Mitsui and eompnny, the Toyo Kisen
Ktfisha and W. R. Grace and company.
The big liner Tenyo Maru of the T. K,
K. is due here from Japan today. An
effort is to be m.ido to have her Orien
tal crew unload her cargo.
With the strike looming last night,
passengers who attempted to purchase
transportation on four Sacramento
river steamers were turned back and
informed that tickets could not be sold,
ns the boats would probably not make
their regular trips.
' As the walk out affects delivery of
liuited States mails to river points,
the government has already made ar
rangements to continue the postal ser
vice with gasoline launches and by au
tomobile. '
Final efforts to avert the strike were
made last night by state l.ibor commis
sioner McLaughlin. Representatives of
steamboat and river men met at his of
fice, but no compromise was reached.
Speaking for the employers affected,
0. E. Cooke, president of the Water
front Employrs union said the demands
were unreasonable and therefore had
leen rejected. He deel ired the em
ployers were ready to grant a reas
onable increase.

Carranza Note Made for Home
Consumption Gross Mis
statement of Facts
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, June 1. There will be
no withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico at Carranza 'a request. Instead
the administration will issue a state
ment probably within a week or 10
days, informing . Carranza of rejection
of his request, and calling attention
to misstatements of fact about the Mex
ican situation, contained in his latest
withdrawal demands.
In framing the statement, officials
will o on the theory that the general
tenor of the- note is fiercer than the
actual convention text; that it is chief
ly a document for home consumption. It
will tnke issue with Carranza 's claim
that the Mexican government did not
know American forces were crossing the
boundary in pursuit of Villa until days
after the hunt started.
It will declare there was no agree
ment between Generals Scott and Obre
gon nbt to send a second expedition
after the Boquillns and Glenn Springs
raiders. In this connection the United
States will doubtless insinuate that Car
ran, lias not been co-operating, else
Major Lajigliorne'fl expedition would
have encountered Carranza border pa
trols some time during , his 125 mile
drive south of the Big Bend.
President Wilson's absence from
town tomorrow will delay cabinet con
sideration of the question until Tues
day. One of the first steps in consideration
of steps today was a conference be
tween Counsellor Folk of the state de
partment and Genernl Scott.
Judge Douglas, attorney for tho em
bassy here, just back from a visit to
Carranza declared Carranza and his
backers do not want a clash with the
United States, realizing that it would
mark the end of their rule in Mex-
Harmony Is Threatened.
The noto, which is addressed to Sec
retary Lansing, reads in part as fol
lows: "The Mexican government has just
received advices that, a group of Amer
ican troops has crossed the frontier and
penetrated Mexican territory and at
present is near a place called l.l raso,
some 70 miles tu the south of the fron
tier. This newly e'I'fected passage of
troops without the consent of the
Mexican government places in grave
danger the harmony and good relations
which ought to exist between the gov
ernments, of the United States and
Mexico.
"This government must consider this
last act a violation of its sovereignty
and thus asks in the most urgent man
ner that the Washington government
consider with care the case and once
for all define with exactitude the poli
cy it intends to pursue with respect
t othe Mexican government.
"To the end of making clearer the
basis upon which tho petition con
tained in the 'present note is founded,
it is necessary carefullv to state the
facts which have occurred up to this
time as a result of incursion of a baud
on Columbus, N. M., captained by Fran
cisco Villa, at dawn, March S, last.

FRENCH ARE PREPARING
TO SURRENDER HILL 304
The French Say Beyond Trif
ling Gains, Germans Ac-
complished Nothing
Berlin, June 1. The French are pre
paring to surrender Hill ;104, last of the
strongly fortified heights remaining in
their possession northwest of Verdun.
Several French positions on the sum
mit, torn by tho pounding fire of Ger
man guns, already have been, evacuated.
The next general assault on the posi
tion will probably bring it into the
hands of the Germans.
From Haucourt eastward to the
Meuse, the German front is pressing
steadily southward in daily "nibbles"
at the French line. Tho French are
offering desperately tenacious resist
ance, but are steadily falling back up
on the Cluiiny line. The most furious
French counter attacks, delivered at
heavy sacrifices .in men, have resulted
in only temporary successes, the Ger
mans pressing on after each fresh
check.
The French line has been striped of
reserves brought up for the defense of
Verdun.
Recent concentration of troops behind
the Anglo-French front indicate that
the British are preparing to'tnko'ovT
another stroteu of t rench front,, releas
ing French troops for service at Ver
dun. ,
German military critics, commenting
on France's diro need of more men
for the defense of her great fortress,
asked today what has become of the
'great Russian army" which was to
t ave halted the German advance on the
fortiess. It is authoritatively stated
here that not a single one of the few
thousand Russians reported to have
been landed at Marseilles has been in
action on the western front.
Attacks Are Repulsed.
Taris, June 1. The complete repulse
or a uermnn attack on the eastern
slopes of Dxad Man's hill was. an
nounced by the war office today. The
liermaos bombarded all French posi
tious in the Dead Man's hill region with
tho greatest violence throughout yestor
dav. Intense nrtillery duels continued
throughout last night on the east bank
of the Meuse, but there were no other
important infantry nctions around Ver
dun. French nir squadrons early today
dropped 20 shells on the Thiouville and
Audun stations and 50 shells on the
supply depots at Azannes.
German Loss 300,000.
Taris, June 1. The Germans have
thrown more than 75,000 fresh troops

five new German divisions have been

"HIS LIFE NOT ENOUGH"
TO MAKE REPARATION
Says He Is Willing to Sur
render That As Partial
Payment for Crimes
New York, June 1. Dr. Arthur War
ren Waite, was today sentenced to die
in the electric chair at Sing Sing some
time during the week beginning July
10th. .
Before the confessed murderer nf
John E. Peck, Grand Rapids, Michigan
millionaire, was sentenced he thanked
the court for the manner in which his
trial was cbnducted.
"I am willing to give my life in
partial payment for the wrongs I have
done others," Waite said, in a speech
to the court.
"I only regret that I have nothing
more than a life to give them. My
soul will go on and on trying to make
reparation for the wrongs I have
done."
Dr. Waite was calm, and displayed
ao emotion whatever when the sentence
of death was pronounced. The arch
poisoner who confessed to two murders.
an attempt at a third and to petty
crimes throughout his life, stood be
tween two deputies with a third deputy
behind him when Justice Shearn pro
nounced the wordv that sent him to
the Sing Sing death house.
When asked if he had anything to
say as to why sentence should not be
pronounced, he replied, "I have not."
He then asked that he be permitted to
say a few words. Tho request was
graated, and in a steady voice, Waite
began his speech.
"I wish to thank tho court," he be
gan, "for the fair and expeditious mari
ner in which my trial was conducted.
I thank Mr. Brothers (the assistant dis
trict attorney, who prosecuted the
case), for tho conscientious way in
which he did his duty toward tho eo
plo and the justice be has done me.
"I also thank my counsel, Mr. Deuel,
for his efforts. He is sincere in the
belief that I nm insane, and did all he
could.
"To ask forgiveness of those whom
I have wronged would be almost im
possible But I am willing to give up
my life in partinl puimcnt for the
hurt I have done."
Percy Peck, son of the old man
Waite murdered in hopes of gaining the
Peck millions, was in court, as was
Frank Waite, brother .of the con
demned man. They were the only mem
bers of either family, who heard the
death sentence passed. Mrs. Margaret
Horton, Waite 's "studio companion"
was absent.
After being sentenced, n hand cuff
was snnppcd over Waite 's wrist. A
deputy held the other end of the steel
"nippers." Waite was then led away
to be taken by automobile to Grand
Central station where the 11:07 train
was taken for Ossining.
Corvallis & Eastern Prepares
to Exnd Road Across to
Eastern Oregon
Articles of incorporation for an 11
mile extension to the Corvallis k Kast
ern were filed today at the office of
the corporation commissioner, which
appears to be the first link of tho
Southern Pacific line across the Cas
cades to Bead. The mod as outlined in
the description proposes to begin at a
point near Hoover in Marion county nnd
extend in a southeasterly direction
along the North Fork of the Hnntinm

Hoover is located some three miles
beynng Detroit which is now the end
of the Corvallis 4: Eastern line. When
the road was (first trmistrin'ted the
line extended four miles beyond Detroit
to a place called Iduiiha. Later the
rails were torn up from Mnnha back
to Detroit nnd Idanha reverted back to

BARNES AND PENROSE MAY
UPSET WELL UID PLANS
If Penrose Supports Roosevelt
Fight Is Over Say the
Wise Ones
By Perry Arnold.
(United Press stoiff correspondent.)
Cthicago, June 1. Tho campaign of
Frank Hitchcock for Justice Charles
Hughes appeared today to have united
the anti-Hughes elements in the stand
pat republican ranks with tho Roose
velt republicans in a concerted attacK
on Hughes with a possible agreement
on Roosevelt in the offing.
Around Candidates Roy at the hotels
today there was every indication that
a combine against Hughes is under
way. .
The situation, however, was muddled
a bit y tho arrival today of Willie
Barnes, Jr., of New York, foe of the
colonel.
Barnes, it is said, may hold the key
to tho situation.
The arrival here of Senator Boise
Penrose of Pennsylvania, was anxious
ly awaited. There was an undercur
rent of feeling that Penrose; even
more than Barnes, holds the situation
in his hands. If he jumps to Boose
volt, as it has been rumored he" would,
the battle is over, politicians say; if
he fights agnhist the colonel, then it 1b
a free f,or all.
Barnes After Toddy.
Barnes on his arrival was planning to
jump into tho thick of tho Yray this
afternoon, announcing that he was go
ing to the committee meeting at the
Coliseum.
"I won' say anything now," ho snnj.
ped. "Maybe I'll talk later."
Roosovelt, himself, is ready to co
operate with anyono who is for him.
This was emphasized today by John
McGrath, the colonel's private secre
tary, who reached Chicago today after
accompanying the colonel on his trip to
Ht. Louis. . -
"I am morel v here to co-operate
with all persons, of whatever party, sup
porting Roosevelt," McGrath said.
"Is Roosevelt a candidatel" Mc
Grath was asked.
"Most assuredly ho is," he replied.
Thore was a pronounced feeling today
that nothing would heal the breach
between Roosevelt and the old guard
moro quickly than Hitchcock's efforts
for Hughes.
Tho former postmaster genernl was
accused by republicans today of "try
ing to capitalize Ihb card catalogue."
Favorite Sons Open Shop.
Hitchcock has a complete card in
dex of southern voters and delegates,
it. was stated. It was rumored today
that Coleman Dul'ont of Delaware,
would withdraw from tho race in favor
of Justice Hughes, swinging six dele
gates to the Hughes' column.
Two new presidential headquarters
were opened along Candidates' How to

Report Says He Will Marry
Jolanda, Daughter of King
Victor Emanuel
Paris, Juno 1, That Princo Edward
of Wiles, heir apparent to tho British
throne, is to marry Princess Jolanda,
the oldeat daughter of King Victor
Emmanuel of ltuly and a girl of rare
beauty, was the report received here to
day from Rome. It is rumored an
nouncement of the engagement is im
minent. The 22 yonr old Prince of Wales vis
ited Rome a few weeks ago and then
made a trip to tho Italian front wheKc
he was the guest of King Victor Em
manuel. After his return the king is
said to have summoned the princess,
with the queen, to army headquarters
to extend his congratulations. It was
while reutrning from this visit that
the queen ami Princess Jolanda nar
rowly escaped death "when Austrian
aviators attacked their train.
The Princess Jolanda colebrated her
fifteenth birthday today. Bhe is said
to be very beautiful and loved by tho
Italiin people. Interest here in the re
ported engngemont centers in the fact
tnat the bonds of friendship between
two of tho allies would be materially
strengthened by the mornaRe.. .
May Settle Strike
Ban Francisco, Juno 1. Six hours
after the strike of 5,000 stevedores, rig
gets and longshoremen of the Sun Fran
cisco waterfront, who had beon refused
a raise in wages by steamship owners,
a number of employers today capitul
ated to half the demands of the strik
ers. It was announced that following a
meeting of the Kteamship Owners' as
sociation, it had bee nagreed to prunt
tho demands of the men for 55 cents
an hour for a nine hour working day.
Nothing was Said of the demand for
$1.00 an hour for overtime in lieu of
the present "scale of 75 cents.
Secretary Foley of the Pnion this
afternoon announced that there will be
settlement of the strike situation to
day. On the arrival of the T. K. K. liner

Br H. L. Rennick
(United Press staff correspondent)
Chicago, June ls George W. Perkins
brought tho olive brunch to the.G. Ol
P. again today. The bull moose ekief
tain, after greeting Chairmau Ililles of
tho republican .national committer at
tho Blackstone, announced flatly that
the progressives still stand on tne state
ment they outlined in January, indi
cating they will support any candidal
not neeesftnly Roosevelt who stands
for progressive principles.
"I Bee in the papers and I heard oa
the train, while en route here, that a.
lot of bitter feeling has been worked
up between the camps of tho different
candidates," Perkins said.
"This is unfortunate. As far as thfl
progressives aro concerned, we will ap
proach the conventions in t.io spirit
we indicated in our January statement.
"This is pro-oniincntly the tirae
when conventions should be for Amer

"I read in the papors that Carrinza,
in his note delivered to. Washington
lyertorday, had accused the Wilson a
ministration of duplicity md of mis
leading the Mexican government. It
occurs to mo that thlB was the first
time that any foreign power had dared
accuse Uncle 8 im of treachery.

"Our prime object should be, with
all possible speed and certainty, to stop
this sort of a thing and restore oir

As Perkins entered the Blackstone
he shook hands with Chairman Hillea

guard, and several other republican
They chatted informally ,ind lauslv
ingly expressed hopes of getting togeth

In this statement Ililles had
nounced tho republicans were

that
thit
this wus the big issue.
Ililles told interviewers today
ho beliovod tho progressives and
re-
publicans would get together.
I don't think they have changed,"
he said. "I believe they were abso
lutely sincere in their January state
ment, I hnvo not been assured o. this,
fact by Colonel Roosevelt, but I do It- .
lievo the colonel'B followers would ac

Ililles branded as ilwolutely false a
report that the national .commute

"We'll naturally talk about tiling

" Hub we are not going to pick anyonw
