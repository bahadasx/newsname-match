Motorcycle Race
The attempt of the.Sheeps
bead Bay, New York, promoters
to encroach upon the internat
ional motorcycle rape given an
nually in Dodge City has failed.
Carl Turner today received a
telegram from John L. Donovan,
chairman of the competition
committee of the Federation of
American Motorcyclist, saying
the Dodge City race would be
protected by the , organization.
.His telegram says? i
- F. A. M. cannot sanction in
ternational event, not having in-!
ternational agreement; have so
notified Sbeepshead Bay promot
ers. Will protect you whenever
possible.
He also received a letter from
T.J.Sullivan, editor of Motor
Cycling, a Magazine published
in Chicago. Mr. Sullivan has at
tended both cf the Dodge City
races and has pronounced . them
the finest ever held in the Unit
ed States and has been a loyal
booster for the big race to be
held here July 4. It shows that
the East recognizes the value of
motorcycle contests and would
like to get the race that Dodge
City has been bandltng so suc
cessfully. His letter also indi
cates that the manufacturars are
planning to send- their fastest
machines and best riders to
Dodge City this year in greater
numbers than ever.
The following is a' proof of an
article which will appear in
Motor-Cycling in Saturday's is
sue: Chicago, May, 15 Chairman
of the F. A,' M Competition
Committee, John L. Donovan, re
plying to inquiries of motorcycle
manufacturers, announced the
first of the week that be had giv
en an exclusive sanction to the
Dodge City 300-mile race for
July 4, and would not issue any
otner 300 or zuu mile race on
that date to any other trackx in
any other section of the country.
This apparently prevents the
holding of the proposed 200-mile
race at Sbeepshead Bay Speed
way, July 4, under the auspices
of the Speedway Motorcycle
Club, Inc., but Chairman Dono
van strives to'make it plain that
he is not discriminating against
any clubs or race promoters,
aiming merely to simplify the
problems of the manufacturers
in making arrangements for
their racing teams. Dodge City

The Sweet Trial
Syracuse, Kansas, May 31.
Archie Sweet must take the
stand before Judge Downer will
consider a motion to quash the
case against him, filed by at
torneys for the. defense in the
trial of Sweet for the murder of
Nellie Byers, the Grant county
school teacher, today. When
the state rested this morning,
the defense filed its motion and
arguments followed. Judge
Downer held that as they bad
promised yesterday to put Sweet
on the stand this must be done
before he would consider the
motion.
Dr. E. H. Ballou, a Dodge City
dentist, was the firBt witness cal
led for the defense today; He
showed the impression of teeth
marks on the murdered girl, cut
out out of the body and preserv
ed in alcohol. The jurors ex
amined this with a magnifying
glass. Ballou also exhibited
casts of teeth marks of Sweet
and Henson and said he was
positive the bite on the body was
made by Henson and not Sweet.
His story will be rebutted by at
least two witnesses, the state
announced. .
, Detectives White and Buck
told their story today. , White
was station agent at Moscow and
worked with Buck and Zunick in
the effort to unravel the crime.
His testimony is regarded as
more favorable to the state than
the defense. He said he still be
lieves Sweet guilty of the crime.
Buck swore that Sweet was left
handed, or used bis left as well
as bis right, because in a boxing
match Sweet bad knocked him
down with his left. .
. Attorney General Brewster,
who is assisting he Grant coun
ty authorities in prosecuting the
case, bad -ome fun with the wit
ness, bringing a laugh when he
asked bimifhedid not come to
him to be informed if be could
not sue the state for his costs.
Archie Sweet is now 'the only
remaining witness in which there
is any interest. His cross ex
amination promises to be the
climax of the long trial and At
torney General Brewster is ex
pected to develop something at
that time. 1
