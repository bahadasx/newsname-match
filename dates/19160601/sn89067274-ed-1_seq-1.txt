EDITORIALS SHOULD EX
PRESS EDITOR'S THOUGHT
WHILE in Columbia ,last week,
listening to the address of the great
editorial writer, Arthur Brisbane,
we thought surely he must be mis
taken when we understood him to
say that it was "the business of the
editor to tell the people what they
thought instead of telling them what
him the cdilor'a idea about a propo
sition was." On reading the following
from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
we find that our ears did not decieve
In his advice to young editorial
writers given through a Post-Dis-jitrh
, interview, Arthur Brisbane,
it New York Journal's gilt-edged
rite mid:
Fourth the business of tho
nemtapcr is to tH the peoplo
vhat liry, tho people, think, And
who writes the editorials
The people want to know what '
they think, not what the editor
thinks Just aa the crying baby
wants to know what is the matter
with somebody else
We hope the young journalists will
not follow this advice. It may bring
hame and humiliation upon Dhem
and cause disaster to the people they
are trying to lead into right action.
A man who does this doesn't think;
he merely thinks he thinks he thinks.
The duty of the editorial writer is
to write what he thinks, not what he
thinks the public thinks that road
would lead him into strange and
fatal paths. He should know how to
think logically and intelligently and
then in the light of all the informa
tion he can gather he should express
his opinion honestly and fearlessly.
He should follow principle in his
thought.
Public opinion is sometimes warp
ed by passion, prejudice and ignor
ance. It is the duty of a newspaper
to expose and oppose opinion of that
sort and guide the public to wiser con
clusions. There is nothing more
forceful and sensational than the
truth, and in the end all men must
come to the man who utters it.
Telling a child what is the matter
with him is quite different from think
ing as the child thinks. The child
may be ignorant as to what is the
matter with him, and may need a
remedy that he does not think he
wants. ,
Frequently the very thing the peo
ple are suffering from is wrong
thought. To correct their thought is
the greatest service that can be ren
dered them. It corrects everything.
Miss Nannie Wright, one of Mex
ico's popular teachers in the public
schools, who has been seriously ill,
is reported much better to the delight
of her many friends.

MEXICO WON IN THE SEVENTH
Marshall Pitched a Good Game for
the Locals M. M. A. Cadets
Assisted in Winning.
The Mexico Athletics went to Hig-
bea Tuesday and defeated Iligbee 4 to
2. Those who knew had auid ii, wax
a two to one shot for the miners, in
fact with a few of the regulars out
of the Mexico line-up for the bench
it looked like a victory for Iligbee.
That was before the game. .
With the score two to one in the
seventh, Ty Roberts singled to center.
Browning bunted, advanced Roberts
and went to first when Neally booted
the ball. P. Marshall fouled out to
third. Ty Roberts stole tifird on
Harriman and Browning took second.
B .Marshall popped out to first. With
two down Jim Tom Edmonston laid
one down the third base line and
beat it out, scoring Roberts. Brown
ing who had advanced to third scor
ed on a wild pitch. Kistler fanned.
Marshall pitched a nice game but
without support would have been de
feated. He allowed only four hits
but his fielders stopped eight line
drives. Two double plays brought
him out of bad holes ,
Goff and Browning from the Mis
souri Military Academy team played
with Mexico Tuesday. Goff looks
good to the boys on short. He recei
ved two chances yesterday and as
sisted in a fast double play. Brown
ing scored two of the Athletics runs
and helped push Ty Roberts over.

The purpose of an advertising club
is best explained in the organization's
Standard of Practice:

ing public first that they take the
best advantages of their opportuni
ties. 1 '
We will not at any time knowingly
do anything which will injuriously
affect advertising, nor will we care
lessly speak ill jof any advertising
medium. ' i
We will work together to the end of
making all advertising mora truth
ful, knowing it will then be more ef
fective and of greater benefit to the
buying public. .
We will exercise care, individually,
at all times, to see that every adver
tisement with which we have any
thing to do shall 1 measure up to the
plain, simple truth. We stand firmly
for constructive advertising and con
demn, without reserve, all forms of
destructive advertising.
To each other we, pledge patient
service toward the upbuilding of ad
vertising in this community.
To all business men of this com
munity, we pledge co-operation to
ward the advancement of the com

WHAT BABY WOULD SAY
If baby could talk he would say
Don't kiss me in the mouth.
Don't let the sun shine in my eyes
nor the wind fill them with dust.
Do not sneeze or cough in my face,
for I may take cold and that would
be bad for me.
Do not expose me to whooping
cough and measles or other catching
diseases or I may get sick and die.
Do not pick me up by the arm3.
Be careful how you handle me and
lay me down.
Do not give me candy and other
things which are not good for me.
Do not give a dirty pacifier to
suck or allow me to suck my thumb,
for it will spoil the shape of my
mouth.
Do not rock me to sleep or teach
me other bad habits.
Do not take me to the moving pic
ture shows or keep me up nights,
for it robs me of my sleep and makes
me cross.
Do not dose me with patent medi
cines or nasty mixtures.
Do not give me wine, beer or whis
key, coffee nor tea, for I want to
keep well.
Do not jolt me or trot me on your
knee when I cry. (
I want right things to eat and I
want my meals on time.
I want some pure, cool water to
drink between meals, for I get very
thirsty.
I want a bath every day and plenty
of clean clothes
I want my own bed, a comfortable
room with the windows open, and
plenty of time for Bleep, for I must
have it in order to grow.
I want to be taken out of doors
ever day for the fresh air.
I want mother to love me and al
ways be gentle with me.
I want to be a good baby.
This list of suggestions on how to
care for an infant properly was re
centley prepared by the state board
of health of Kansas. Dr. M. P. Rav
enel, professor of preventive medi
cine in the University of Missouri at
Columbia, believes the list is a good
one and that it will be a great help
to Misouri Mothers.
