News of the marriage of Miss
Fleeta Kitchings to Mr. N. D.
James of Forest, Mississippi, has
been received here by friends.
Mrs. James will be remembered
as one of our teachers who
taught in the public school here
the past term.
Born, to Mr. and Mrs. J. B.
Gunter, May 27th, a daughter.
Mrs. Gunter has been with her
mother, Mrs. E. C. Hayes, for
some time. Mr. Gunter came up
from Socorro and arrived almost
simultaneously with his new
daughter.
C. R. Talkington of Checotah,
Oklahoma, has been here the
past week. He owns land in
the valley and is here to size the
situation up. He is a school
teacher, and may file an applica
tion for the principalship of the
Estancia schools.
The Milbourns put in thirty-
three acres of Sudan grass this
year, getting only a fair stand.
Mr. Milbourn says it is hard to
get a good stand of such a plant
for the reason that if it is plant
ed deep enough to have the moist
ure it is apt to unfold before it
gets through the blanket of dry
earth. He reports that in some
fields a good many cut worms
have been killed by the wind
roiling them in the dust.
W. B. Garland, who last fall
bought the W. W. Crawford
place and is farming ground that
has grown to weeds for several
years, is having trouble with
worms- They have taken his
corn clean, and he will have to
replant. He . says they have
gone to the weeds at the borders
of the field and have cleaned up
a strip of weeds several rods in
width.
A young blood who had im
bibed too much Tuesday evening
jumped into an automobile and
went careering wildly on a short
spin, part of the time on two
wheels, narrowly missing a num
ber of houses and telephone poles
and frightening horses. He was
finally dragged from the car and
the commotion stopped. Is there
no law to punish that sort of
sportiveness? It was sheer luck
that the escapade did not result
disastrously.
A letter from W. E. Campbell,
formerly a settler of the valley
but who has been for some years
at Salado, Texas, written to Dr.
Mason, says that Mr. Campbell is
planning to return here about
September, and that be has
neighbors who talk of coming.
He says he lost money by return
ing to Texas and has never been
contented there. The letter was
wcitten May 21, and on the pre
vious night occurred the worst
storm and rain Mr. Campbell
ever saw. He had a hundred
acres of grain, and it was flat
tened as if a log had been rolled
over it, and it was a question
whether or not it would straight
en up so that it could be cut
Eugene Mattingly of Lucy was
here Monday on business.
The Atkinson family, includ
ing Mr. and Mrs. Finley and Mr.
and Mrs. Standhart, were up
from Corona to attend Decora
tion Day services.
Fritz Zweig loaded a car of
salt here last week, hauling it
across from the big salt lake by
team. Most of the salt sold from
the lake is loaded at Lucy and
shipped over the Santa Fe.
J. C. Montgomery arrived from
Texas the latter part of last
week, and preparations are go
ing forward for the drilling of
we lis on his holdings on the
north county line and those of J.
R. Dennis adjoining.
County Agent Harwell held an
interesting meeting at bocino
last week, where there was an
attendance of sixty He reports
that the Boys and Girls are now
well organized and ñjur'a'uir all
over the county.
C. B. Roland was in town last
Saturday for the first time since
his accident. He is not able to
work yet, but can get about pret
ty well. It will be remembered
that he was hurt by being caught
under the roof of a falling barn.
The collapse of the barn was
caused by the weight of snow
upon it.
D. D. Smith, who lives north
east of town, reporta that the
citworms are not damaging him
great deal this year. He
doesn't take any stock in the
theory that good cultivation one
year will insure immunity from
cut worms the following year,
because last year the worms took
two plantings of corn for him on
ground that had been well culti
vated and kept free of weeds the
previous year.
Mcintosh Ladies' Aid, who
gave the entertainment the
evening of the last day of school,
were very successful in their ef
forts. A big crowd was in at
tendance. Standing room was
at a premium. The very best of
order prevailed throughout. We
were under many obligations to
the musicians Mr. Lyman Tim-
mons and Mr. Mitchell who as
sisted Mrs. Wagner, our organ
ist also to Miss Nellie Long and
Mr. George Merrifield for recita
tions which were encored to the
echoes.
Mr.' Harwell received a tele
gram from Col. Sellers of Albu
querque urging that an attempt
be made here to get recruits for
the New Mexico National Guard.
When the call first came a phone
message from santa i e asked
that preliminary steps be taken
to get recruits here and stated
that a recruiting officer would be
here shortly. Bills were printed
and thorough publicity given the
call, but the recruiting officer did
not show up. As far as we are
informed, no recruits showed up,
either. As a matter of fact
there seems to be the utmost in
difference among the young men
eligible for this service. They
do not seem at all inclined to help
defend their state against bandit
raids.
J. R. Dennis' mule team creat
ed some excitement on the street
Saturday evening. They had
been hitched to W. T. Guinn's
well drilling outfit with the en
gine hitched on as a trailer. The
mules were frightened by the
frame work of the drill hanging
over their backs, and a line
breaking at the critical moment,
the driver could not control them.
They circled around and passed
between the corner of the Clark
grocery and the telephone pole
and then between the pole and
the corner at Freilinger'a saloon,
bringing up against the hitch
rack south of Romero's store.
The engine truck was cast loose
and upset, sustaining some minor
breaks, but no serious damage
was done. The mules were
hitched to the thing again and
again entered vigorous protest.
They were then hitched to a
wagon and the drill put on as a
trailer, when they went off quiet
ly enough.
A quiet pretty wedding took
place Sunday, the 21st of this
month, at the M. E. parsonage
in Albuquerque when Mrs. Grace
Goodin, formerly of Estancia,
New Mexico, became the wife
of Mr. Frank Donlin, the genial
and well known clerk of the
Sturges Hotel of Albuquerque.
The ceremony was performed at
6 o'clock by the Rev. C. O.
Beckman in the presence of a
few relatives and friends. Mrs.
Beswick of the Casa De Oro and
Mrs. Beckman, both of Albu
querque, were witnesses. The
management of the Sturges Ho
tel served the wedding dinner to
the party after the ceremony.
Mr. and Mrs. Donlin with Mrs.
Donlin's little son, Vernon Good
in, will make their b roe in Al
buquerque. Albuquerque Journal.
John T. Kimmona was ac
quitted last week at Carrizozo,
where the case was taken on
change of venue from this coun
ty. Most of our readers are
familiar with the case.
The state was represented by
District Attorney H. B. Hamil
ton, assisted by Judge W. W.
Gatewoodof Roswell, while the
defense was conducted by Col.
Geo. W. Prichard of Santa Fe.
There had been a rnntrnvprnv
between John T. Kimmons and
N. B. Brown, postmaster at Var
ney, as to the exact location of
the line dividing their holdings
ox iana. un April 13, 1915, Mr.
and Mrs. Kimmons went to a
place near the line where T. W.
Allen, in the employ of Brown,
was cutting timber, and accord
ing to Kimmons' claim was
across the line on his land-
While Kimmons and Allen were
talking Brown appeared and a
heated altercation followed, re
sulting in the shooting and kill
ing of Brown bv Kimmona.
Kimmons claimed from the start
that he acted in self defense,
and the verdict substantiates his
contention.
The eye witnesses were Allen
and Mrs. Kimmons. Ralph Mar
ble, county surveyor, surveyed
and made a plat of the scene,
and testified in that respect.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Kimmons
testified that Brown had an axe
raised over his shoulder and was
coming toward Kimmons with
an imprecation when the latter
tired.
Allen testified that Brown had
the axe in his hand, but that the
blade rested upon the ground.
Pedro Sanchez of Manzano last
Monday started across the moun
tains to Los Lunas on horseback
with a companion. On the west
ern slope of the mountains his
horse fell on him and broke his
leg. With the help of his com
panion he remounted and started
home. The horse fell on him
again before reaching home.
Dr. Amble was summoned and
found a compound fracture with
the bone protruding between
the knee and ankle.
Memorial and Decoration Day
exercises this year were more in
teresting and had a better at
tendance in Estancia than for a
number of years previously.
The programs were especially
good and especially well render
ed, reflecting credit alike on
Mrs. Watson, who arranged and
supervised the programs, and
those who took part.
County Agent Harwell held a
meeting at Negra Monday night
that was attended by forty peo
ple, all of them interested.
TO THE PUBLIC
I have been asina Chamberlain's
Tablets for indigestion for the past six
months, and it attords me pleasure to

WHY YOU ARE NERVOUS
The nervous system is the alarm system
of the human body.
In perfect health we hardly realize that
we have a network of nerves, but when
health is ebbing, when strength is declin
ing, the same nervous system gives the
alarm in headaches, tiredness, dreamful
sleep, irritability and unless corrected,
leads straight to a breakdown.
To correct nervousness, Scott's Emul
sion is exactly what yon should take; its
rich nutriment gets into ths blood and
rich blood feeds the tiny nerve-cells while
the whole system responds to its refresh
ing tonic force. It is free -from alcohol.
