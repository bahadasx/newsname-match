Gen. Funston Asked to Outline
Clearly Situation Confronting
Gen. Pershing in the Vicinity
of Chihuahua.
It was stated authoritatively today
that American troops will not
he withdrawn from Mexico until
the Carranza authorities demonstrate
control of the situation
sufficient to protect the American
border. A reply to that effect
probably will be made to Gen.
( arranza's note. President Wil
son was represented today as
ready to withdraw the troops
when possible, but determined to
wait until the Carranza forces can
control the situation.
War Department Is Active.
Steps were taken by the War Department
today to obtain more definite
information of the disposition, of Carranza
troops in Chihuahua. It was
said that the Carranza note prompted
the action of military officials without
regard to the diplomatic phases of the
situation.
Men. Funston has been asked to outline
clearly the situation in Chihuahua,
a cording to his most recent information
of the whereabouts of Carranza detachments.
No anxiety is felt for the
safety of Gen. Pershing's columns, but
in view of the statements in Gen. Car
ranza's note sprinted elsewhere in The
Star) it is desired to know as accurately
as possible what the movements of
his forces are.
It was explained at the War Department
that the real mission of the expedition
at this time was to prevent attacks
upon the wide sections of the
border controlled by its position in
Mexico. As a question of military
stiategy. it is considered that only a
force disposed as are Gen. Pershing's
troops could accomplish that.
Keeps Bandits From Assembling.
A large border garrison or patrol, it i
was pointed out. might repel an attack I
but could not make it impossible. With j
Gen Pershing's forces ready to break j
up any attempt by bandits to assemble !
a force for a surprise attack on an i
American border town, officials feel
that renewal of raiding within the zone
controlled by his forces is virtually
impossible.
Cavalry patrols are active through
the territory on both sides of Gen.
Pershing's bases and his line of communications.
and War Department officials
hold that a rendition of complete |
security is being maintained in this
region and along the border, despite j
the allegations of the '"arranza note j
t.ha* the expcd:tion is "interned in Chihuahua
state;"9 'ying idle and with no
military object, its position constitut- j
ing a continued menare to the peace of j
t?t<- two countries.
No Reinforcement Contemplated.
No additional troop movements were in j
contemplation today so far as known.
Th?r? wan r?r. indication at the State
rtepartment that the developments had i
produced an urgent situation. A reply j
may nM he made for a week or ten da\s. j
Various inaccurate statements it makes 1
will be pointed out References to the
effect of American domestic politics upon j
the border situation, the suggestion that
all Latin America is waiting to see what
the United States will do to maintain Its
protestations of friendship and the referee
e to American trade in war munitions
with Europe probably will be wholly ignored.
although it is understood they
would have brought a sharp rebuke if any
!**.?. perplexed and disordered government
had taken such a course.

To Concentrate Artillery
on Border Near Carranza
Troops' Assembling Point
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. June 1.?Three
batter es of the ?ih field Artillery win
be concentrated at Douglas, Ariz., the
strategic point of a district opposite a
region in Mexico where Sonora troopy
have been concentrated, according to
announcement here today. Gen. Funston
suggested to the War Department
a few days ago that such precaution*
should be taken, and the approval of
the department was received last night.
One battery of the 6th is now at
| Douglas. The two that will be sent I
there will be taken from Laredo and t
Eagle Pass, those batteries being re- j
I lieved by battejies of the 3d, which |
I has been held here. i
Reports from Gen. Pershing failed
to indicate any increased activity in
the Mexican forces beyond his lines.
The gradual concentration of Carranza's
troops in the north has been continued.
but no friction of any consequence
between them and the American
j troops has occurred.
It was expected that the conference
j between Gen. Pershing and Gen. Gavira
would take place today at or near
rasas Grandes. Gen. Gavira, who asked
for the interview, left yesterday for
Casas Grandes.
| Preparations for Conference.
! COLONTA DTTBLAN, Mexico. June 1.
via wireless to Columbus. N. M.?Every
preparation has been made for the pro
posed conference on military co-operation
between Gabriel Gavira. Carranza
commander of northern Chihuahua, and
Gen. J. J. Pershing. American expeditionary
commander. It is believed the informal
talks will begin late today.
Gen. Pershing declined to make any
comment on the conference. No place
for the meeting has been chosen, although
Gen. Pershing today received a
Carranza captain, who called to inform
him of Gen. Gavira's arrival, and suggest
the station at Xuevo Grandes -as
the place for the meeting.
Gen. Pershing made the trip by motor
from field headquarters, near Xamiquipa,
accompanied by Lieut. Col. Cabella.
his chief of staff, his personal
aid. a stenographer and interpreter
and a small guard. The journey was
made without incident, it being broken
by a night stop at El Valle. Gen.
Gavira reached here from Juarez
aboard a special train, accompanied by
his personal staff and an escort of
about sixty men.

District Court of Appeals Affirms
Decision Against
Board of Education Edict.
10 ? 1^1 r> iiiftomoiOTriiT
lb ntLU InluUIVblb I LIM I
WITH SCHOOL LAWS
Decision Will Force Restoration of
Mrs. Hellmann to Position
as Pedagogue.
The District Court of Appeals, in an
opinion by Chief Justice Shepard, today
affirmed the decision of Justice Gould
of the District Supreme Court, holding ;
rule 45 of the board of education,
which automatically removes a female
teacher on her marriage, to be inconsistent
with the organic school law.
The effect of the decision is to compel
the beard of education to restore Mrs.
Gladys Aline Strong Hellmann to a
position as teacher in the public
schools, from which she was removed
in September, 1914. because of her
marriage in July, 1914.
*R.r?1? TTolH TTnroflKnnnhlp
The lower court sustained both contentions
of Attorney Paul E. Eesh for
the teacher, that the rule of the board
was not only in conflict with the organic
school act, but was also unreasonable.
The appellate court declares
that, having found the rule incon- j
sistent with the provision of law that j '
all removals must be by the board on !
written recommendation of the su- ;
perintendent of schools, it is unnecessary
to pass on the question of the reasonableness
or unreasonableness of
th* board's rule.
After quoting the relevant portions .
of th* act of June 20. 1006, called the
organic school law, the appellate court
says "These provisions show a clear
intent to continue the teaching force
of tb* public schools by an indefinite
tenure, so long as the work of the
teacher is satisfactory, giving 'annual
longevity increases without action of
the board of education, and until the
teacher, unless she left voluntarily,
should b? removed upon the written
recommendation of the superintendent
of schools in accordance with section 2
of the act.
Inconsistent and Void.
"If a teacher becomes inefficient or
fails to perform a duty or does som*
afr u men 01 irseir impairs usefulness,
then a good or reasonable cause for
dismissal would exist. It is. however,
unnecessary to pass upon the reasonableness
or unreasonableness of rule
45, because in the view that we have
taken the statute provides that teachers
shall be dismissed upon the recommendation
of the superintendent of
schools. Inasmuch as rule 45 provides
for the automatic dismissal of teachers
without respect to the procedure provided
in the statute, it is, in that respect,
inconsistent with the statute and
therefore void."
Assistant Corporation Counsel Stephens
represented the board of education.

ROOSEVELT TO RUN,

John R. McGrath Makes For
mal Announcement of the
Colonel's Candidacy.
MOOSE MEN ALTERNATES
FOR OREGON'S DELEGATE
Significant Move Made for Harmon
Between Hughes Sponsors
and Progressives.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, June I.?Form;
announcement was made at 1
o'clock today of Col. Roosevelt
candidacy for the Presidenti;
nomination by the regular reptil
Iican convention.
The announcement of his candidac
came from John R. McGrath, the co
onel's private secretary, who came 1
Chicago to take pers<$nal charge of '
R.'s interests. He comes with creder
tials to speak for the colonel. Theodoi
Roosevelt, like Justice Hughes, has nevt
said whether lie would accept the r<
publican nomination. As a progressiv
and the founder of that party, son
people professed to believe that Cc
Roosevelt would not have anythm
more to do with the republican part
nur aceepi oince ai ii? nanua. x>ui. i
order that all doubts may be swej
aside Col. Roosevelt has authorized h
private secretary. McGrath, to say th<
he is an avowed candidate for the r?
publican nomination.
McGrath arrived here this mornin
having left the colonel in St. Louis la
evening. When seen at the Blackstoi
Hotel, where he has his headquarter
with a telephone line running directly 1
Sagamore Hill, he was asked the poii
blank question of whether the colonel
or is not a candidate for the republics
nomination.
"Of Course He Is Candidate/'
"Of course he is a candidate," replie
McGrath. "J thought that every one ui
derstood that and so does the colonel, bi
if there is any doubt about the matt*
whatsoever, you may say that I am ai
thorized to speak for him and that 1
will accept the republcan nomination
it is tendered to him. Every one knov
what his principles are, and what the i;
sue will be in the campaign if he is nom
nated."
McGrath was asked whether the r?
ports that the progressive conventio
will nominate Col. Roosevelt by a<
clamation on the first day. thereby pu'
ting him up to the republican conver
tion as the only man the progressive
will accept, were true.
"I h:i v.. lint th a uliffhtaat i/ica n-ht
the progressive convention will do, an
more than Col. Roosevelt has. He wi
not try to boss the progressive cor
ventioh, and the delegates will do whs
they think best. I don't know whethe
they will nominate the colonel z
all, any more than I know whethc
the republican convention will nom
nate him. If such things can be fixe
up in advance what would be the ur
of holding a convention?"
Significant Move for Harmony.
A very significant move for harmor
between Hughes supporters and th
progressives has- been effected in tl
Oregon delegation, which for the m<
merit, is the "official" sponsor of tl
Hughes boom. The Oregon delegatic
will seat, as alternates, in the reguh
republican convention, the delegate
which the bull moosers elected to tl
progressive convention Thus, the bu
moosers will be in their own convei
tion as delegates, and with the regulf
republicans as alternates. This a
rangement has resulted In establishiri
the best of relations between the r<
publican factions in Oregon.
Senator Smoot, who arrived today,
certain the convention will end in hai
monv. "Every candidate," he sal
"will have an equal chance with ever
other candidate. There will be 985 fr#
patriotic republicans 4P the conventic
acting with th* primary purpose <
nominating a candidate and framing
platform with which we can retire tl
present vacillating, wabbling, spinelei
and costly Wilson administration."

That Hughes strength among a?

creasing seems to be indicated. TI
great mass of uninstructed delegate
are yet to be heard from as to the
choice. The allies and Roosevelt ai
frantically working to gather uni
themselves these uninstructed del<
gates.
In a sense the allies and the colon1
are working together to deprit
Hughes of votes. In the last analys
the allies and the colonel will turn ar
rend each other for the Quarry, if th
bring down Hughes. So, it is literali
true that the allies are menaced on tw
sides?first, by Hughes sentiment, ar
next by the necessity which will cor
front them of having to deal with tl
colonel if they dispose of Hughes. A
to the allies themselves, the sever;
camps report daily gains in recruits i

Accessions Are Inconsequential.
The accessions, however, are incons<
C4ueritial compared with the figure
which would represent even a con
manding lead. No ally can yet sul
stantiate a claim to possessing such a<
vantage. The recruits are coming
by individuals. Nothing will coui
until the time arrives when entire sta
delegations begin to swing into line f<
one and another candidate, and wh<
influential states such as New Yor
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Indiai
indicate their last-ditch stand. At pre

or divided, "flfty-flfty," such as Ne

MOMENTOUS BATTLE I
CONTINUES UNABATED
Paris Insists That First Line West
of the Meuse Is Still

LONDON, June 1.?The momentous
battle at Verdun shows no sign of j
slackening in violence, but the latest i
official reports, in contrast with most >
\>f those issued during the last few I
days, record no further advances from I
the Germans, but gains for the French.
In an attacg on German positions ,
southeast of Dead Man hill, on the Verdun
front, the French obtained a foothold
in the German first-line trenches
over an extent of 400 meters, the Berlin
war office admitted today. The
French made repeated assaults on the
^~- ??? ?? v.,,* nth^r than that, at
the point mentioned were beaten off
with extremely heavy losses, according
to the report.
The center of the bitterest fighting
has shifted somewhat to the southwest
of the front between Cumieres and
I>ead Man hill, west of the Meuse,
where the Germans have scored most
of their recent gains.
Dead Man hill, or the ground in its
inVmediate vicinity, has been the scene
of the latest infantry engagements.
The Germans attacked the French positions
here last night, but were completely
repulsed, according to this afternoon's
bulletin from Paris, the German
defeat following a success for the
French achieved yesterday when they
captured from the Germans a fortified
position southwest of the hill.
Unofficial reports from Paris point to
the growing intensity of the desperate
struggle at Verdun. They declare, however,
that despite the tremendous efforts
of the Germans the French first
line west of the Meuse is still unbroken
and that the Germans must
score further advances before they can
force the main issue by carrying the
battle to the opposite bank of the
Meuse, where the Bras-DouaumontVaux
line continues to bar a direct advance
upon the fortress.

"On the left bank of the River Meuse
the bombardment continued with great
violence last night in all the territory
around Dead Man hill. A determined
German attack, delivered yesterday
evening at 8 o'clock, against our positions
upon the eastern slopes of the
hill, was completely repulsed by our
fire.
"On the right bank of the river the
artillery fighting has become exceedingly
intense to the west and also east
of Fort Douaumont.
"The night passed in relative quiet
along the remainder of the front.
"During the night of May 31-June 1
a French air squadron threw down
twenty shells on the railroad stations
of Thiaonville. Audun and Le Roman,
and fifty other shells upon the commissary
headquarters of the enemy at 1
Azannes."
British Communication.
The following British official communication
was issued early this morning:
"Despite the unfavorable weather Tuesday
our aeroplanes did good work. Tuesday
night the enemy bombarded our
trenches about Fricourt, north and south
of Neuve Cnapelle and east of Laventie.
The bombardment about Neuve Chapelle !
was very heavy. It lasted eighty min- !
utes and was followed by an infantry
raid which penetrated our trenches and
took some of our men prisoners. The ]
raiding party subsequently was driven j
out. East of Laventie another raiding
party attempted to enter our trenches,
but was driven back by our bombers.
"During the night the enemy sprang a ,
mine just north of the Bethune-La Basse
road and our troops occupied the near lip j
of the crater. There also was some un- *
important mining activity about Loos.
"Wednesdav hostile art;llerv was arrive .
against our position about Fricourt, Anthuelle,
Souchez, Arras, Neuville, St.
Vaast and Loos. Our artillery effectively
engaged hostile batteries in the neighborhood
of Souchez and Lieuvin and bombarded
enemy positions south of the Bois
Grenier. Our trenches about Ypres were j
shelled intermittently during the day." ,
Greatest Teutonic Effort. \
PARIS. June 1.?More complete ac- (
counts reaching here from Verdun \
j show that the battle which raged from i
I May 27 to May 30 and ended, accord- 1
' ing to a statement of the French war
| office, in a costly check for the Ger!
mans, was the greatest effort made by
i the Teutonic forces in the whole Ver- ,
: dun operations. More and heavier .
j guns and denser masses of troops were
j assembled along the three miles of the !
French front from Hill 304 to the
! Meuse than in any previous attack.
The French stood Arm under an ava- j
lanch of shot and shell and drove back
wave after wave of a flood of Teutonic
infantry. They only surrendered about
100 yards of ground at Little Caurettes
wood, where a trench had been '
obliterated by the terrific fire of the J
German big guns.
According to information given by ,
prisoners the German forces consisted I ,
of two fresh brigades with three com- ;
panies of pioneers. The mission of i
the latter troops was to work around ,
Cumieres and reach the Chattancourt j
village by the road running parallel to ! (
the railroad. j
Proves Costly Failure. [
In the meantime two other regiments *
were ordered to creep along: the bank ?
of the river and seize the Chattancourt t
railroad station, to the west of the vil- s
lage. Another brigade was instructed
to storm the woods and hedgerows a
which border Chattancourt to the west, F
while other detachments, acting still g
farther to the west, were to support the n
attack. In the opinion of French mili- n
tary critics the result was not only a a
costly failure for the Germans, but a ,c
success for the French, such as they
have rarely attained.
The Germans suffered so heavily that
they ceased further attacks, while the
French, by a prompt counter attack, reestablished
themselves again south of 1
Cumieres and won an important point 1<
of vantage on the southwestern slope t
of Dead Man hill. t:
It develops that during yesterday's t<
battle west of the Meuse the Germans
sent back the French line between Dead f
Man hill and Cumieres for a distance of a
three-quarters of a mile. The French h
battalions, however, which had retired "

PRESIDENT TO LEAD,
MARCHING ON FOOT
Voices Wish to Take Part in
Great Preparedness
Pageant.
CABINET MAY FORM
HIS PERSONAL ESCORT
Mr. Wilson to Grant Full Holiday
to Government Employes if
Law Permits.
The Senate today unanimously passed
i joint resolution authorizing the District
Commissioners to make the necessary
regulations regarding; street traf
Tor the prcparedncNM parade June 14.
The resolution wan offered by Senator
lohn Walter Smith of Maryland.
President Wilson, marching on
foot, will lead the preparedness
parade to be held Flag day,
June 14.
The President told members of
the preparedness parade committee
who called at the White
House today that he wanted to
take part in the great demonstration.
He said the idea was
a line one, and expressed the
hope that as many persons as pos
sible would take part in it and
make it a success.
The committeemen called to invite
the President to review the parade. He
accepted their invitation immediately,
and then said that he not only wished
to review the parade, but also participate
in it.
May Grant Full Holiday.
Further evidence of the President*?
interest in the demonstration was indicated
by a promise to grant a full
holiday to government employes in
Washington on Flag day, June 14, If
the law will permit. In event he is
unable to do this, the President promised
to grant by executive order a holiday
to all government employes who
desire to participate in the preparedness
parade.
Members of the preparedness parade
committee who called on the President
were William F. Gude, chairman; Rudolph
Kauffmann, treasurer, and
Charles J. Columbus, secretary. They
told the President they were of the
opinion the laws governing the operation
of the government departments
will permit him to grant a full holiday
June 14 and that if he learns otherwise
there are many precedents for granting
a holiday to those employes of the government
offices who want to take part
in the preparedness demonstration. The
President promised to let the committee
know of his decision in the matter as
soon as possible.
Senator Chamberlain of Oregon,
chairman of the military affairs committee
of the Senate, today gave his indorsement
to the preparedness par&dft,
and said that he hoped to be able to
participate. The senator said that unless
his affairs made it impossible for
him to do so, he expected to be in the
line of march.
Cabinet Also May March.
Members of the cabinet have been
invited to participate in the parade, and
it is now confidently believed that the
department heads will inarch with the
President as a personal escort. The
President proposes to march the entire
distance to be traversed by the procession,
then leave the line and take hie
position in" a stand and review the remainder
of the marchers as they pass
by.
Now that the President has signified
!iis desire to be one of the preparedness
parade marchers it is believed that the
Marine Band will receive orders to participate
in the parade. In this event
the band would be given the place of
lonor at the head of the line.
News of the announcement that Presdent
Wilson was to take part in the
parade spread over the city today in a
few minutes. None of the members of
the preparedness parade committees or
>ersons with whom they spoke could
emember having witnessed or read an
iccount of a parade up Pennsylvania
ivenue in which the President of the
. nuea sraies marcnea on toot. >>om?
pf the members of the committee expressed
the belief that when President
Wilson participates in the parade on
'oot he will be establishing another
precedent.
Minister and Sons to March.
The attitude of one clergyman toward
the preparedness parade is clearly
indicated in a letter which Chairman
CJude has received from Rev. D. H.
Martin, pastor of Dumbarton Avenue
Methodist Episcopal Church. In answer
to a letter asking his co-operation,
Mr. Martin says:
"I shall consider it my duty as well as
my privilege to help in any way I can.
I have two boys, one twelve and the
other eight years of age. I want them
to march in the parade. I don't want
my boys to grow up to be either liars
or cowards. I want them to learn th?
lessons of true patriotism early in life,
rhe impression of this parade will remain
with them all of their lives, and
[ want them to be in it, as well as myself."
