DECORATION DAY OBSERVED
Memorial Sdnday and Decoration
Day, Tuesday, May 30th, were fittingly
observed by Beaver citizens and once
mure honor and tribute was paid to
those who fought in the Great Strug
gle for their country's freedom and
who now sleep "Under the sod and the
dew, waiting the Judgment day; Un
der the laurel the Blue; Under the
willow the Gray."
Memorial services were conducted
r., thc-,tabernat&w Rv.'Ohs',I).,Jo
man. pastor of the Methodist church,
delivering the address. Ills remarks
were well chosen and a fitting tribute
paid to both the living and the dead.
Decoration Day was observed by ex
ercises at the cemetery In the morning
at which time the graves were dec
orated and the G. A. It held brief ser
vices. The thin ranks of the Old Sol
diers was sadly noticed, Only a few
of the Old Boys were out and as they
walked with feeble tottering step,
proudly carrying Old Glory before
themf the thought must have ocaured
to all present that It would only be a
few more, years, at the most, until all
would have answered the final roll call
and It would then devolve upon the
sons and daughters of veterans to keep
the camp fires burning.
In the afternoon exercises were held
at the tabernacle. The band and choir
furnished music. Hey. L. L, Shaw,
pastor of the Christian church, de
livered the address of the day, others
made brief remarks and the Old Sol
diers made short talks. Rev. Shaw
gave a splendid talk which was to the
point and filled with zeal and patriot
ism. The remainder of the program
was also much enjoyed.
ALWAYS CLAD TOPAY
The is one bill which comes to this
office which we are always glad to pay
and that is the bill for the maintenance
of the street sprinkler. The constant
sprinkling of the streets the past few
weeks, during the extremely dry
weather and the high winds, has been
all that has made it possible to breathe
without' inhaling vast quantities of
sand and dirt.. While we may be able
to get along without some con
veniences, we hardly see how we can
do without the street sprinkler now.
It is a rea treasure.
I have the best farm
loan proposition in Bea

H. N. LAWSON, Agent
FOUNDER OF BEAYER PAYS TOWN A
VISIT
Judge . B. Jewett, one of the
founders of the town of Beaver, paid
this city a call Saturday nf last week
and while hero called at the Herald
office. Judge Jewett In company with
F II. Jones nnd II. Hewitt drove
overland from their home in Wichita,
Kansas. They were in this section in
the interest of the Farmers' and Bank
ers' Life Insurance Company, of which
Judge Jewett Is treasurer and the other
gentlemen salesmen, and while so near
drove on over to Beaver to take a look
at the town and note its development.
In company with other Wichita men
Judge Jewett founded the town of
Beaver in 1887 and it was he who gave
the town its name. One of the prin
cipal streets of the town and one which
seems destined to become the leading
residence street bears his name. It Is
Jewett avenue, the first street west of
Douglas avenue. The gentlemen were
much pleased with Beaver and the
surrounding country and were favor
ably Impressed with the splendid pro
gress which the town has made and ItB
brilliant prospects for the future.
Judge Jewett has spent many years
and much money in town development
In the west and Is prepared to know
whereof )'" speaks when it comes to
predicting futures in new and unde
veloped sections. He gave it as his
opinion that Beaver was particularly
well located so as to enjoy steady and
s.ibftanilat growth and that the town
should lu time make a live bustling
little city. Kvery indication seems to
point in tliHt direction at this time.
There certainly Is a most remarkable
change since the little company of
Wichita promoters pushed their way
into the then, "No Man's Land" and
laid off the town of Beaver on the
banks of the river of the same name.
Many ahangeB have been wrought In
the thirty years that have passed since
that time. The little burg Iibb wit
nessed many stirring events and its
name and fame has spread far abroad.
Few inland towns have attained the
notoriety that Beaver enjoyed even be'
fore the building of the railroad) and
this latest achievement has certainly
put us in a class by ourself when it
comes to doing things and getting
what we go after.
J. R. CRABTREE PASSES AWAY
The Death Angel entered our midst
agalu this week snatching away one of
our old and honored citizens, J. II.
Crabtree, who passed away at Win-
field, Kansas, Monday, May 29th, fol
lowing an operation for gall stones.
The remains were brought to Beaver
and funeral services conducted Wed
nesday afternoon at the Methodist
church by Rev. L. L. Shaw. Inter
ment was made in Beaver cemetery.
Mr. Crabtree had been a resident of
Beaver for many years having proved
up a homestead near here and was well
known aud respected by a wide qircle
of friends and neighbors He was an
Old Soldier and his departure brought
keen sorrow to his old comrades who
had been associated with him for years
and whose ranks are fast growing thin.
Only a fen remain and but three were
able to attend the funeral. He was
also a member of the Methodist church
and for years had lived a faithful, con
sistent Christian life. He is survived
by three sons, James and Aody, of
Beaver, and Ernest, of Wichita, Kan
sas, and five daughters, Mrs, C. P.
Parks, of Winfleld, Kansas, Mrs. L. .
Brannoif, of Newkiri, Mrs. Perry York
and Mrs. McOlenny, of Washington,
and Mist Erma Crabtree, of Beaver.
The wife and two children preceded
him to the Great Ijeyoud.
By the death of this man a respected
citizen, a kind father and a good neigh
bor has passed to his long rest. During ,
the many years which he lived in our
midst his life was clean and open, he
thought or did no harm to anyone and
was ever ready to assist those who
needed him. When, after a long and
useful life, he was called to his reward,
he left behind hlin a record for up
rightness, honesty and moru!ty which
few obtain and which after all, is life's
greatest heritage.
It is with sincere regret that we
chronicle the passing of Mr Crabtree
and we extend to the family our heart
felt sympathy in their sorrow. In so
doiug, we are joined by a host of
friends who knew him and respected
him and wIiobo heartB go out in tender
sympathy for the bereaved.
Three surgical operations were per
formed by Dr. Levi at the Beaver Hos
pital on Tuesday of this week. The
patients are A, O. Lovett, lvho lives

of the same community, and II. A,
Uaumgartner, of Logan , Each on: ra

patients are convaleioing nicely.

vided, In bidding goodbye to Beavor High
the senior class do not expect to aban
don their educational work but aspire
to go nn in higher institutions cf learn
ing until they have reached the top of
the ladder and have received their
college degree. A number of the class
will probably enter Oklahoma univer
sity next year.
The class of '10 have done good work
the past year and deserve a great deal
of credit for the record they have
made. Choosing for their motto, "Ich
Dierl", wnlch means "I serve" or
"Service", they have endeavored to
live 'up tp Its true meaning and have
done faithful, diligent work during the
entire year.
The oxerelses Friday night were a
fitting climax to the school year.
Each graduate had a part in the pro
gram and all did remarkably well It
Is indeed a credit to Beavor schools to .
graduate such a class and not only the j
boys and girls but the patrons of the
schools' and all interested iu the cause
of education feci a pride in the splen
did record which B. 11, 8. has mado, ,
BEAVER WINS AGAIN
Beaver and Liberal baseball teams
crossed bats on the Beaver diamond
Saturday afternoon. The wild en
thusiasm which generally attends the
games was lacking, probably due to
the fact that the scores ran high and
from the first the indications were
favorable for victory for the home
team. Beaver won by .a score of A to
9 -V- 4.Ut.h.it btttftl &., . ,
Mumps have made their apjearance
in Beaver. Little Hale Loofbounow

A MODERN PLAYHOUSE FOR BEAVER
Spangler Bros, have changed the r
original plans somewhat and instead

BANK MOVES TO NEW HOME
The First National Bank moved into
Its new homo on the corner of Second

extensive plate glass windows, Insure
tho best lighting facilities as well
a add beauty to the general appear-'
mice of the structure, The inside dec
orations and fixtures are also very at
tractive. The building Is an ornamout
to that corner and a most desirable

f
Summer Normal.
IrS
??
I have arranged for Summer Normal to be held at Bea
ver, beginning June 5th. J have been led to do this from
the expressions of many of the teachers of this county who
wish to attend Normal and do not feel that they can afford
the expense necessary to attend summer schools at one of
the State Normals. 1 have secured competent instructors
and feel that this will be one of the most successful nor
mals ever held in this county.
The law - requires that teachers must attend normal if
certificates are to be renewed. Remember that there are
extra subjects added to the requirements and that you
should take advantage of this opportunity.
In order to lessen the expense, a boarding club will be
organized if the teachers wish.
I urge every teacher to be present. Your
presence will be helpful.
