FLORIDA REAPS
A RICH REWARD
State is Coming Into its Own
After Years of Struggle
A Word Tribute
. At the threshold of our peace
ful land, fair Florida smiles,. Her
hair is garlanded with grey moss
and pal sunshine, and the light
of a thousand crystal lakes is in
her soft blue eyes.
Her sister states bow her hom
age and reach, out their hands in
warm welcome, for Florida ,is
blossoming Into perfect woman
hood. Matured by years of self
sacrifice and patient waiting, her
arms now overflow with plenty.
Honey sweetness the full, red lips
of her, and orange flowers have
formed the bridal wreath which
is to grace her wedding with pros
perity. Since, the first dim caravans
wound their slow path amidst the
.sand shoals, and Seminole camp
fires shone dull red in the peace
of the magic summer nights, Flor
ida has been fairer than her sis
ters. A child among the other
states, we have disliked to see her
grow up have wanted to keep
her forever young forever light-
hearted forever brimming with
that wondrous sentiment and ro
mance which sways in the orange
groves and -rises, like a purple
mist, from sunny rivers and pal
metto treasure troves.
We have wanted to watch her
as she romped merrily through
the years, plumed with red feath
ers from the Everglades and
strewing rose petals and jassa
mine and scarlet threads of Poin
settia in a perfumed shower over
the thankful earth. But the hour
of transformation is at hand. A
woman, she stands, at the gates
of the universe radient vital
ized by success, a power for much
good.
Our united markets arc open ton
her sou s yield she has cut deep
furrows across her fertile breast
and the seed taking root has
flourished. From shore to shore
from boundary line to bouu
dray line, the song of rugged,
honest labor is in the air. It
sings its melodic way, from Jack
sonville to the keys and no fairy
bow on fairy strings has ever
matched the sweet chords that
yon plow coaxes from the upturn
ed earth. Where yesterday
she played in her own sunshine,
nor knew her own great hidden
resources today wheels hum and
tractors plod from dawn .to twi
light, the nightingale makes mag
ic, and on broad roads, lining the
tropic woodlands like bands of
silver, the caravan of commerce
seeks its outlet.
Oh the wonder of it all !
The sure knowledge wc have
that God, Himself, has guided ev
ery plow and dampened every
tiny teed with heaven-sCnt dews
of promise this must, be Flori
da's greatest thought." For the
waiting has been long and the
suffering much, and many angry
seas have snarled upon the low
shores, ere reward was sent weep
ing in as conies a shining Argos.
We greet you, Fair Florida!
We share your happiness and
are proud right proud of you.
Whisperings have come, these
many days past of ripening crops
and buried wealth that lonsr has
.slept, unreckoned. Your native
sons, with their heads bare to the
eternal summer and their sleev -
es rolled up on brawny, brown
arms, have reason to sing as they
guide the plow. For every steel
blade uncovers an undreamed joy
and every crooning rain gives
lrink to fresh prosperity. You
are in pace with the world, Flori
da. You are building creating
planning raising a
nation's
high standards to higher planes
You have reached your hand into
the soil at your feet and are help
ing to feed the hungry, three
thousand miles away.
And while war's hideous touch
withers the old world and leaves
women and children crying for
bread, you are covering the dark
loam with seedling life are, like
some master mason of the fields,
piling crop on crop, sheaf on
sheaf bud on bud and leaf on
'leaf, until barns arc destined to
bulge, with their store, and the
overflow will inevitably run into
the very arteries of wasted na
tions. Yes there at the threshold of
of our land, you smile fairer for
your new responsibilities and
made radient by a halo of fine
purpose. We never saw you pret
tier never knew you to be more
beautiful in the way that mother
nature beautifies. The Qulf
Stream brings spice" 'o Arcady to
your sunlit hair, as. it drifts on
the wind, and all about you and
over you is the deathless mys
tery of growing things.
You have truly come into your

High School Graduate May Ob
tain Scholarship to Uni
versity A large number of students
who have been graduated from
the high schools of the state will
lack funds with which to continue
their education. At least one
student from each county may ob
tain a scholarship which will pay
his board and lodging at the Uni
versity of Florida. P. II. Rolfs,
dean of the College of Agricul
ture, calls the attention of high
school graduates to an act passed
by the last legislature. It auth
orizes the commissioners of each
county to grant a scholarship to
the student making the highest
grade in a competitive examina
tion. The only requirements to re
ceive the scholarship are that the
student stand highest in the ex
amination and agree to engage in
some agricultural pursuit in Flor
ida. . This offers an excellent op
portunity for some high school
graduate, who has not the funds,
to obtain an education in agricul
ture. Four counties gave .these
scholarships last year.

Voting for a
When there are three or more
candidates running for the same
office every voter should vote both
a first and second choice vote.
Not to do so is to only cast a half
a vote.
The second choice vote is to
take the place of the old second
primary, and if the voters will
study it they will see that it is
practically the same as holding a
second primary..
We will take the sheriff's race
in DeSoto county as an illustra
tion. Under the old primary if
one of the three candidates did
not got a majority over his two
opponents, the low man dropped
out and the two candidates re
ceiving the highest votes were
the candidates in the second pri
mary, in the coming primary
there are three candidates for
sherilT in this county. Tho first
vota cast for each will be counted
and the man receiving the small
est number of first class votes will
drop out of the race, then the sec
ond choice votes on his ticket will
be counted for the other two just
the same as though they were
first choice votes.
Supposing the coming election
was to be held under the old pri
mary law. At th? first primary
Carlton received 1,200 votes, Dis
hong 1,400 and Freeman 1,300.
Then Carlton would drop out of
the race and his votes would go
to the other candidates according
to the wishes of the people.
It is practically the same, with
the second choice votes under the
present law. 'If. in the coming

Cover Crops Restore Organic
Matter to Citrus Groves
Conditions have been favorable
for the destruction of organic
matter in citrus soils this spring.
Owing to the continued ' drouth,
the soil has become dry, in some
cases several inches deep. The
organic matter has been greatly
reduced. Even where growers
have maintained a dust mulch to
conserve moisture, there has been
a reduction of humus making ma
terials in the top layer of soil. Ox
idation has been going on rapidly.
This has reduced the medium up
on which the soil organisms
thrive.
A soil is "dead" and will not
maintain normal plant growth
when it does not contain enough
organic matter to maintain the
soil organisms. B. F. Floyd, plant
physiologist to the University of
Florida Experiment Station, rec
ommends that the deficiency of
humus making materials in the
soil be checked by growing and
turning under a cover crop of
weeds and grass or legumes.
It the volunteer growth has
been heavy heretofore, probably
no prepartion will be necessary.
But if the wild growth has been
sparse, it will be well to plant le
guminous cover crop. The seed

it can be sown when the grove is
laid by for the summer. Legumes
recommended for Florida groves
are cowpeas, Deggar weeu, mm
sometimes velvet beans.
If the soil is open, sandy and
lacking in humus it may be ad
visable to make a light applica
tion of stable manure for soil in
oculation. i i i

Cultivation
s Better Straw
berry slants
Strawberry plant beds should
be cultivated to keep weeds down
and to allow the plants to make
good root growth. A. P. Spencer,
district agent for the University
of Florida Extension Division,
suggests that the runners be
trained down the row before they
take root. The middles should be
left free to allow cultivation. If
the runners arc not trained along
the row they will set roots in the
middle, and cultivation will have
to be given with the hoe.

counted to sec which of the other
two candidates the voting for
Carlton preferred. A second
choice vote on his ticket counting
just as much for one of the other
candidates after Carlton was out
of the race as tho first choice vote
counted for that candidate.
On the other hand if none of
Carlton's supporters had voted
second choice votes it would not
have helped Carlton. Should Carl
ton be one of the high men (which
we believe most likely) then his
second choice votes will count for
no one.
There are five candidates run
ning for governor and it is possi
ble 125,000 votes will be cast.
Supposing Catt3 leads with 27,

with 25,000. Wood with 24,000
and Farris with 23,000. The sec
ond choice votes on the tickets
cast for Catts and Knott would be
eliminated, but the second choice
votes cast on the tickets of Hud
son, Wood and Farris for Catts
and Knott would be counted for
them.
In short, when you cast both a
first and" second choice vote you
simply have two votes. If your
first choice man is high man that
settles it ; your second choice vote
does not count. But if your first
choice man is one of the low men
then your second choice vote
counts as much as a first choice
vote for that man. Wauchula

use-one of two methods. The first
is to turn the runners along each
row as previously suggested. The
other is to train the runners from
two rows into one middle and cul
tivate alternate middles. Either
method will give more plants and
better plants than if the runners
are allowed to wander over the
whole ground surface and prevent
cultivation. The workings should
be given with some light imple
ment that will keep weeds and
grass in check.
How Much of Your Soil 31d Ycu
sell in the Orange Crop?
Do you know how much of the
three principal plant foods you
shipped in your orange crop this
year? The knowledge is impor
tant for an intelligent applica
tion of fertilizers. S. S. Walker,
associate chemist to the Univer
sity of Florida Experiment Sta
tion, throws some light on the a
mount of plant food removed by
a crop of oranges in the following
statement :
"The Florida Grower of May
6, 1916, reports the total move
ment of oranges up to that date
as 17,500 carloads. This is equiv
alent to approximately 6,335,000
boxes or about 253,400 tons of
fruit. Eighty-five percent, of
this, or 215,390 tons, consists of
water which costs the Florida
fruit grower nothing, but there
re also considerable amounts of
plant food shipped out of the
state in the orange crop.
"According to analyses made
by the Chemistry Department of
tne experiment Station, the Flor
ida orange contains on an average
0.143 percent, ammonia, 0.054 per
cent, phosphoric acid, and 0.293
per cent, potash. Figuring the to
tals for the entire crop,"it is found
that last season's oranges have
carried with them plant food e
quivalent to the following a
mounts of commercial fertilizers:
1449 tons of 25 per cent, sulphate
of ammonia; 855 tons of 16 per
cent, acid phosphate; and 1515
tons or 49 percent sulphate of
potash.
"Any grower who wishes to
calculate the amount of plant
food removed by his crop may do
so by the following. Each 100
boxes removes the equivalent of
4b pounds of Zti per cent, sulphate
of ammonia; 26.5 pounds of 16
Per cent, acid phosphate: 47.8
potash. vr
Growers should take account of
these figures when they are fertil
izing their groves. These figures
nd do not take account of the
,
food which should be applied for
new growth and some which nec
essarily is lost thru leaching.

Potash Extracted From Wyoming
Lava
. It has been known for a num
ber of years that a lava in the
Leucite Hills, Sweetwater county,
Wyo., is composed of largely of
leucite, a mineral rich in potash.
This lava, called wyomingite, is
there very abundant, and the to
tal quantity of potash it contains
is immense, estimated at 200,000,
000 tons. Like the gold in sea
water, however,it has not yet been
profitably extracted. In a series
of experimental studies of the re
actions of various salts on wyom
iqgite under certain conditions,
Roger C. Wells, of the chemical
laboratory of the United States
Geological Survey, has obtained
interesting results as to the ex
traction of potash from wyoming
ite, which aro published in the
Survey's Professional Paper 98-D.
Mr. Well's paper may prove sug
gestive to chemists who are study
ing methods of extraction of pot
ash from igneous rocks.

as at Xanthia.
There have been no further de

patch from the Italian capital to
the Paris Matin.
A strong attack was made
Monday night with a fresh divis
ion of German troops on the Ver
dun front west of the Meuse be
tween Dead Man hill andCunier
es. The war office statement says
there was a slight French retire
ment on the Bethincourt-Cuinier
es road.
All attempts of the Germans to
gain ground on the remainder of .
the positions under attack were
repulsed.
The Germans maintained heavy
artillery fire west of Fort Pouau-

In Monday's fighting the Ger
mans gained some 300 metres of
French trench near Cumieres.
In the Lagarina valley severe
fighting continues. The Aus-trians
launched a strong offensive a
gainst the Italians in the Lagari
na valley. There was some of the
hardest fighting of the campaign.
It resulted, Rome reports, in re
pulse of the Austrians, who lost
heavily. The Austrians have tak
