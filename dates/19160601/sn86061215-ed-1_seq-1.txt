Hystery Is Cleared By the
Presentation of Demand
for a Withdrawal
NOT AN ULTIMATUM
IS OFFICIAL VIEW
Merely a Continuation of
Efforts to Get Troops
to Leave Mexico
Washington, D. C., May 81. —A new
note from Gen. Carranza asking for a
definite explanation of the continued
presence of American troops in Mex
ico and renewing his previous
request
for their withdrawal was presented to
the state department today by Eliseo
Arredondo, the Carranza ambassador.
Gen. Carranza's new note refers to
lhe repeated declarations that the
United States wants no war with Mex
ico and argues that the withdrawal of
the troops would be the best proof of
that attitude on the part of the Ameri
can government.
The continued presence of the puni
tive expedition, the note says, is hav
ing a contrary effect. It says Carran
za troops are able to control outlawry
In northern Mexico and that coopera
tion by the American troops in pre
venting incursions into the United
States can best be carried on by hav
ing the forces on the American side of
the border. It declares that had the
American troops now In Mexico been
engaged in patrol on the American
side the Glenn Springs and Boquillas.
raids could have been prevented.
State department officials regard the
note not as an ultimatum but as a con
tinuance of the negotiations with the
Carranza government.
After tterfi&rafc the note to Acting
Becretary Polk, Eliseo Arredondo. Gen.
Carranza's ambassador, admitted that
it was brought to Washington Mon
day by Manuel Mendez, an attache of
the Carranza foreign office. .The am
bassador said he denied the existence
of the note at that time because he
wished to ask his foreign office if any
thing had occurred to change its atti
tude during the time the note was en
route to Washington. He received in
structions last night that there had
been no change and' presented the
note this morning. It is signed by
foreign Minister Aguilar, covers about
twenty-eight typewritten pages and la
In Spanish. Arrangements will be
made later for its publication.

BETWEEN LEWS
MEXICAN GENERAL LEAVES BOR­
DER TO CONFER WITH PERSH-
INQ ABOUT MOVES.
El Paso, Tex., May 31.—Gen. Gavira,
constitutionalist commander of north
ern Chihuahua, left Juarez today for
Casa Grandes, 120 miles south of the
frontier, where he will confer with
Gen. Pershing, the American expedi
tionary commander, on closer cooper
ation.
Gen. Pershing was expected to ar
rive in Cases Grandes today by auto
mobile from his field base near Nam
lquipa and the conferences were to be
started tomorrow.
Gen. Gavira left aboard a special
train on the Mexico-Northwestern
railway, accompanied by his staff and
an escort of about sixty men. A
machine gun was mounted on one of
the box cars of the train. Only a small
crowd of Mexicans gathered to watch
the train depart, among them being
Gen. Francisco Gonzales, who will
assume charge of Gen. Gavira*s post
in his absence.
The impending conference is said by
many to be the first real attempt at
Cooperation between the Carranza
forces and the Americans since the ex
peditionary command crossed the bor
der two and a half months ago.
It is pointed out that this is the
natural outcome of the recently held
Scott-Obregon conference, at which
the Mexican minister of war verbally
agreed to make every effort to elim
inate bandits from -northern Mexico.
His first movement was to send large
forces into Chihuahua and the next
was to appoint (Jen. Gavira, whose
command previously covered the strip
from Chihuahua to Pearson, to the
military direction of- the northern half
of the state.
The troops sent by Gen. Trevino,
commander in chief of northern Mexi
co,' to Gen. Gavira have been distribut
ed, at various points along the line of
the Mexican Central railroads. They
will begin a general movement west
ward, closing up on Pershing's lines
with a view to catching the scattered
bandits in the net. It is the possibili
ty of accidental clashes when the two
lines come in contact that caused Gen.
Gavira to seek a conference with Gen.
Perishing, which has been arranged.
"DRIVING AMERICANS OUT."
Columbus, N. M., May 31—Julio
Acosta, a Villlsta leader, formerly Vil

with 800 followers, last reported in the
vicinity of Batopllas, Chihuahua, is
said to be following in the wake of
Gen Pershing's rear outpost south of

From all accounts Acosta is trying
to make it appear in the Namiqulpa
country that he is driving the Amer

they will either have to fight him or
else leave the country peacefully Re
ports have been current for several
days at Columbus that bandit bands
were operating below Gen Pershing's

Paris, May 31.—The German offen

region is being relentlessly pressed
and bit by bit the French are being
forced baok. Gen. Nlvelle's forces,
which yesterday were struggling to ob
tain a foothold in the outskirts of
Cumleres village, have now admittedly
retired in this sector in the face of
infantry attacks which followed an in
tense bombardment
The conceded withdrawal was from
a first line trench near Caurettes
wood, south of Cumleres. In addition
the possibly significant admission is
made that a detachment of German
troops, under cover of fog, was able
to penetrate to the vicinity of Chat*
tancourt, which lies more than a mile
below Cumleres. This force, however,
was annihilated when taken under the
fire of the Frengh artillery, the Paris
war office declares. The German ad

WAR 8UMMARY.
The Germans have captured French

two miles from Le Mort Homme to
Cumleres, northwest of Verdun. The
Germans also have made gains in the
Thlaumont wood, northeast of Verdun.
These gainB have in part been admit

terrible fighting of Monday there ap
parently have been no infantry at

days working as an Individual in be
half of Justice CharleB E. Hughes, as
candidate for the republican nomina
tion for president, today Issued a
statement denying that he ever said
Mr. Hughes would accept the honor.
Mr. Hitchcock said that in reply to
a question as to whether Mr. Hughes
would aooept he merely said no man

a
presidential nomina­
tion tendered by his party in times
like these.
Mr. Hitchcock reiterated his previ
ous statement that he has no author
ity whatever to represent Mr. Hughes.
Charles D. Hllles, chairman of the
national republican committee, denied
emphatically and tersely today a pub
lished report that he had called Jus
tice Hughes over the long distance
telephone in an effort to learn wheth
er Mr. Hitchcock represented the lat

"The report that I had snch a con

Mr. Hllles.
^Senator John W. Weeks of Massa

"Until we hear either from Mr.

DEMOCRATIC PLANS.
Washington, D. C.t May 81.—Plans
for the democratic convention at St.
Louis and the ensuing campaign were
discussed by President Wilson today
with Representative Doremus of
Michigan, chairman of the democratic
congressional committee, Norman
Hapgood, an organizer of the Wilson
nonpartisan league, and Senator Tag
gart of Indiana. Between now and
convention time the president Is ex
pected to devote much attention to
politics.
Selection of a permanent convention
chairman was discussed. Speaker
Champ Clark was the first choice of
the president but it now seems that
Mr. Clark may not go to St. Louis
Senator James of Kentucky, and Sen
ator Kern of Indiana, are among those
suggested for the place In case the
speaker finally declines.
While friends of Vice President
Marshall believe there is no doubt
that he will be renominated, they are
not urging the president to take a
stand on the question because there
are other candidates, notably Gov.
Major of Missouri.
The plan of the convention man
agers is to have Alabama give way to
New Jersey when the roll call Is call
ed for the nomination of presidential
candidates so that John W. Wescott,
who has been selected by President
Wilson to nominate him, may immed
iately make his speech. A motion to
close nominations then would be in
order.

TO SYSTEMATIZE
VOTE COONTING
Board of Supervisors Has
Plan to Lessen Delay
in Getting Result
ALL JUDGES WILL
USE SAME METHOD
Suffrage Ballots Will Be
Counted First and the
News Given Public
To save time in the counting of
primary ballots and to aid the publio
in getting early returns, the board of
supervisors has decided to issue an
order applicable to all the judges of
election in the county.
The board has determined the order
in which the various kinds of ballots
will be counted and the manner in
which the counting is to be done. By
thus systematising the work and in
stalling an approved method of count
ing, it is believed that the public will
be spared the long wait which has al
ways attended former eleotions.
The election judges are to be told
to count the suffrage ballots first. The
supervisors believe there are more
people interested in the suffrage ques
tion than in any other and that for
their benefit, the suffrage ballots
should be counted first. This will per
mit of their compilation at an early
hour and the people sfiould know in
less than an hour after the polls close,
whether Wapello county has gone for
or against, votes for women.
Couiiting System
Adopted.
The judges will take up the regular
primary ballots after they have count
ed the suffrage vote. The order in
which the primary tickets will be
counted follows: republican, demo
cratic, progressive and socialist.
Under the county system adopted by
the board, the judges will first count
the number of ballots cast for each
candidate for tHeHret office mentioned
on the ticket. The clerks will enter
up the count In the tally sheets while
the judges are counting the ballots I
cast for the candidates for the next
office in the list. This action will be
repeated until the ticket is disposed of
and then the same process will be re
peated with the next ticket.
When all the party tickets have
been disposed of, the nonpartisan
ticket on state supreme court judges
will be counted.
Instructions for Judges.
In order that all the judges may
understand the details of the new
counting system, the board has had
instructions printed and copies will be
sent out with the supplies for each
voting ward or precinct. These in-1
structiens
In
the main, are as follows:
FIRST—Start counting as soon as the
polls close. Sort suffrage ballots
into "aye" and "nay" classes count
rapidly and accurately each pile and
'instruct clerks to enter the count in
the tally sheets.
SECOND—Sort primary ballots ac
cording to party—Republican, demo
cratic, progressive, socialist, etc.
THIRD—Take republican ballots and
lay others aside. Sort republican
ballots in piles according to the vote
on candidates for the first office.on
list. Example: For governor. In
first pile place ballotp cast for Allen,
in second put ballots cast for Cos
son, in third put ballots cast for
Harding, fourth pile scattering
votes. The judges can now cooper
ate in counting, quickly and accur
ately the number of ballots cast for
Allen. The clerks can then pro
cede to make the entry in the tally
sheets. While they are so engaged,
the judges can count the ballots cast
for Cosson and the clerks can pro
ceed to make the proper record. The
Judges next count the Harding vote
in like manner and have the clerks
record it. The scattering vote can
next be counted and recorded.
FOURTH—Repeat the above process
In securing the vote of each candi
date under each office on the ticket.
FIFTH—Treat the democratic ballot
in exactly the same manner.
SIXTH—Repeat the operation with as
many tickets as are represented in
the primary.
SEVENTH—Count the nonpartisan
ballots on state supreme court
judges.
By order of the board of supervisors,
Per J. W. Hall, Chairman.
IRISH WILL MAKE
DEMAND ON PARTIES
Chicago, May 81.—Demand will be
made that the republicans and demo
crats incorporate In their platforms
the promise that if the United States
act on the arbitration board at the
close of the European war, Ireland

AME8 EXTEN8ION DEPARTMENT
TO TEACH ADVANCED METH
ODS ON TRIP.
As has been the custom for the past
three years, the department of agricul
tural extension of the state college at
Ames will devote the entire month
of June to a study of the methods
practiced on Iowa farms. Experts
along the lines of soils and farm crops,
aniiqal husbandry, agricultural en
gineering and home economics will
make up the Ames party that will tour
Wapello county June 8.
About six or seven stops will be
made during the day on a farm on
which one or more of the above sub
jects can be taken up and discussed.
Especially is it desirable to notice
the methods used on these farms and
the results obtained.
Four or five talks will be made dur
ing the day by the home economics
woman to the women who are on the
tour. Last year in one county 650
men and women were present at the
meetings and most of them toured the
whole county, starting early in the
morning and finishing about 6 o'clock.
It Is hoped that fanners and business
men who have cars will plan to join
the tour early, bringing as many of
their families or neighbors as possible.
It 1B planned to have a big picnic
dinner at noon on some well located
farm which will add to the pleasure of
the occasion. Make your plaps now.
It will be the big day in the county
this year. Further details will be pub
lished as they are worked out by the
local committees.
The women will have an important
part of the day's program. Short'
talks will be made at four or five of
the stops by a member of the home
economics division.

The talks for the women on the
farm tours will include some of the
most practical and valuable subjects
concerning the home and its care.
Some of the topics which will be con

SPHERE IN CHI
Tokio, May 31.—Great interest is
being shown here In the negotiations
between Japan and Peking in regard
to the revolutionary disturbances in
Nantung province. The cabinet con
sidered the situation at a lengthy ses
sion today. Government officials deny
reports that it has been decided to ex
tend the sphere in which Japanese
military guards have been posted on
the Chinese railroad to other points
in Shantung where Japanese citizens
are believed to be in danger. There is
a strong opinion, however, that such
a step is possible unless Peking ar
ranges for protection of Japanese in
a more satisfactory manner to the im
perial government.
The Japanese minister at Peking re
quested the Chinese government on
May 29 to take proper steps for the
safeguarding of Japanese lives and
property in Shantung. .Recent reports
from this province stated that the
revolutionary movement, which has
already resulted in the formation of
a provisional government in the south
and the secession of several provinces
including Hu-Nan and Sze-Chuang,
was making rapid' headway. In al
most every instance the outbreaks of
the revolutionists were accompanied
with anti-Japanese demonstrations.
