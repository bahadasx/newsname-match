BEMIDJI MADE AUTO
WINSMUGHFAMEAT
BIGSPEEDWAY RACES
Car Constructed From Ford by C. W.
Jewett Heralded as Fastest
for Size.
BREAKING OF AXEL
LOOSES 50-MILE RACE
Bemidji Man to Enter Races on
Fourth of July May Go to
Indianapolis.
The reconstructed Ford automobile
entered by C. W. Jewett of Bemidji
and driven by him in the Twin City
Speedway races Memorial day has
won much fame as a result of the ex
cellent showing made in the races.
Wins 10-Mile Race.
Jewett won the 10-mile race for
non-stock cars, his time being 9:33
finished second in the 10-mile free
for-all handicap and fourth in the
50-mile free-for-all.
The rear axel of Jewett's car was
broken while traveling at 88 miles
an hour at the speedway Sunday. He
was unable to secure another racing
axel in time for Tuesday's events,
and was forced to use a stock car
axel. The change in axels slowed up
the Bemidji man's car fully 15 miles
an hour But for the misfortune,
Jewett's car probably would have
won the 50-mile free-for-all.
Fastest in World.
One of the officials of the A. A A.
made the remark after the races that
Jewett's "Bigmidg" was the fastest
car in the world for its cubic con
tents. The displacement of the car
is 176 cubic inches
Jewett returned from the Twin
Cities this morning. He announced
that he would probably enter the ra
ces at the speedway, Fourth of July.
He may also later on enter races at
the Indianapolis speedway.
Congratulates City.
The following telegram was re
ceived by the Pioneer today from the
Swinhart Tire and Rubber company
of Akron, Ohio, in regard to Jewett's
record:
"Your city and yourselves are to be
congratulated upon the wonderful
showing of Jewett's special Bemidji
in the Memorial Day races. This car
competed against special racing cars
twice and three times its size. Had
Jewett not broken his axel, necessi
tating the use of a road axel, he
would have won every race. A Be
midji car with 'Chad' Jewett driving
on Swinhart tires seems to be a win
ning combination."
ANSWER TO GHARGES
OF TIMBER TRESPASS
St. Paul, Minn., June 1.George
Cochran of Bena, and T. J. Welsh of
Welsh Bros., Bemidji, were before
the state timber board yesterday to
answer charges of trespass made

having cut timber from state lands
unauthorized under their permits and
having disregarded the state mark

pass but said it would amount to
several hundred dollars against each
firm.
Other cases of trespass are said to
be prepared for presentation to the
board, but will be taken up at a later
