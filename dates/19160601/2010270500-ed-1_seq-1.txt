builder of five houses on the banks
of the Big Sioux river without per

is to be prosecuted on five counts by
the building inspector. Inspector
Henoch yesterday laid all the cir
cumstances in the Severson case be
fore Councilman Ward, and with the
sanction of Mayor Andrews the pros
ecutions were ordered. Severson
has been submitting from time to
time evidence the houses cost less
than $500. It is die claim of the
building inspector that this state
ment will be disproved in court.
The inspector informed Severson in
the afternoon that the cases would
bo brought and later swore out the
five warrants for arrest. It is prob
able thrft the caso will come to trial
in police court about Monday. The
cases are being brought against Se
verson to Bhow that the building in
spector intends to enforce the build
ing regulations and to serve as a
warning to other contractors dispos
ed to evade the regulations. Sever
son has filed with the inspector state
ments of cost and affidavits that the
houses did not cost more than $500.
He has also promised, the inspector
said, to take out permits for two
houses now under way and to place
flue linings in chimneys of houses
already built. Severson also is
scheduled to appear in the police
court today to defend himself on a
charge of speeding. He will be
served with the warrant signed by
the building inspector at that time.
Severson was arrested yesterday for
speeding at Eighth and Douglas
streets. He was permitted to sign
his own bond to appear for hearing.

Government irrigated areas, of extensive oil discoveries, new
beet sugar factories, and growing industrial towns. 10,000 acres
of splendid Government-irrigated land near Powell, Wyo., adja

Hawman was an interested specta- '
tor, but took no part in the confer
ence. The result of the discussion
is in the nature of a compromise,
and yet from a legal standpoint is
not a compromise at all, Mr. Kindig
announced. One-half of the liquor
siezed from the rooms of the trans
portation company is to be returned;
one-half is to be brought from its
present repository at Jackson, Neb.,
and turned over to Chief Hawman
for destruction. The replevin ac
tion started by the defendant trans
portation company for recovery of
the liquor is to be dropped and the
defendants are to pay all costs. As
sistant County Attorliey Kindig ex
plained the state's position in the
compromise agreement. He said
about half tho liquor siezed was
properly marked and was not sub
ject to seizure. Some of the seized
goods was taken without a warrant
covering specificically tho property
taken, which in any case is an illegal
procedure, Mr. Kindig said. The
conference resulted in one decision
that will cause a radical change in
the police method of operation in
the future. Hereafter no wagons
loaded with liquors may he seized
unless the officer making the seizure
has in his possession a search war
rant for the goods taken. "The ac
tion was taken by the state," Mr.
Kindig said, "with a full knowledge
that the supreme court on final ap
peal would never have permitted tho
destruction of all the goods seized
in the circumstances."
