Has Plan to Make This

Hotelkecpers can be on the lookout
for an unprecedented rush of visiting
brides and grooms from now until the
end of the month, for Wilmer & Vin
cent have announced that they will
entertain all out-of-town newlyweds
.free of charge at the Majestic theater.
If this news linds its way to the As
sociated Press wires, maybe marrying
couples from al! over the State will ar
range their trips to include Harris
burg, for the records show no previous
sign ol hospitality similar to that
Manager Hopkins sprung on Cupid to
dav.
"Tell all the papers on your ex

"so that brides and grooms coming
this way will be sure to bring their
marriage certificates with them. They
will need these to prove that they are
newlyweds. and these papers will an
swer as passports to the theater.
"Maybe others will join in this
movement and make this city the most
attractive place in the world for
honeymooners. The Chamber of Com
merce or the Rotary Club or somebody
ought to see that there's an automo
bile at the service of brides and
grooms to take them on free trips
through our pretty parks. It wouldn't

Coal Goes Up Ten Cents

A number or retail coal dealers in

' all grades cf hard eoal effective this
morning.
Although several of the dealers said
that they had no definite plan to an
nounce in regard to the rumored fifty
cent increase of several months ago.
it is believed that the price will be
gradually increased until October 1,
jWhen the maximum mark will be
i reached.
i An increase of from 43 to 50 cents
a ton in the wholesale price of coal
| from the mines Is responsible accord
ing to the retailers and this added cost
was placed on the bills during May.
The increase in retail figures, however,
was not made until to-day. but the
j consumer will have to pay at least 45
cents more per ton for anthracite coal
after October 1, 't was said.
The demands granted by the oper
; ators to the miners is the cause of the
jump, according to the announcement,
together with the scarcity of labor. A
i gradual increase In retail price is ex
i pected, however. All sizes and grades
of coal are affected.

VERDUN BATTLE
SHOWS NO SIGNS
OFSLACKENING
Violent Fighting Continues, but
No Further Gains Are Re
corded For Germans
AUSTRIAN'S PUSH AHEAD
Battering Their Way Through
Italians Southeast of
Rovereto
The momentous battle at Verdun
shows no signs of slackening In vio
lence. but the latest official reports,
in contrast with most of those issued
during the last few days, record no
further advances for the Germans.
The center of the bitterest fighting
has shifted somewhat the southwest
of the front between Cumieres and
Head Man Hill, west of the Meuse.
where the Germans have scored most
of their recent gains. Dead Man Hill,
or the ground in its immediate vi
cinity, has been the scene of the last
infantry engagements. The Germans
attacked the French positions here
last night, but were completely re
pulsed, according *o this afternoon's
bulletin front Paris, the German de
feat following a success for the
French achieved yesterday, when they
captured front the Germans a forti
fied position southwest of the hill.
Struggle Growing Intense
Unofficial reports from Paris point
to the growing Intensity of the des
perate struggle at Verun. They de
clare. however, t ha' despite the tre
mendous efforts of the Germans the.
French first line west of the Meuse is
still unbroken and that the Germans
must score further advances here be
fore they can force the main issue
by carrying the battle to the opposite
bank of the Meuse, where the Bras-
Douamont-Vaux line continues to bar
a direct advance upon the fortress.
Current bulletins on the campaign
In the southern Tyrol record con
tinued gains for the Austrians. who
are battering at the line southeast of
overtero, running through the regions
of Schlo, Arsiero and Asiago. The
Italians admit withdrawal along some
sectors of this front, but as yet there
has been no breach In the main line
of their defense which bars the way
to the Venetian plain.
Last Teuton Drive Greatest
of Entire Verdun Operations
By Associated Press
Paris, June I. More complete
accounts reaching here from Verdun
show that the battle which raged from
; May 27 to May 30 and which ended
j according to a statement of the French
i War Office in a costly check for the
Germans, was the greatest effort made
! by the Teutonic forces in the whole
I Verdun operations. More and heavier
guns and denser masses of troops
were assembled along the three miles
! of the French front from Hill 304 to
the Meuse than in any previous at
i tack.
The French stood firm under an
I avalanche of shot and shell and drove
j back wave after wave of a flood of
I Teutonic infantry. They only sur
rendered about 100 yards of ground
at Little Caurettes wood where a
I tiench had been obliterated by the
I terrific fire of the German big guns.
According to information given by
prisoners the German forces con
! sisted of two fresh brigades with three
I companies of pioneers. The mission
!of the latter troops was to work
| around Cumieres and reach the Chat
, tancourt village by the road running
parallel to the railroad. In the mean
time two other regiments were order
ed to creep along the bank of the
: river and seize the Chattancourt Rail
■ road Station to the west of the vil
lage. Another brigade was instructed
to storm the woods which border
Chattancourt to the west, while other
detachments acting still farther to
the west were to support the attack.
In the opinion of French military
ciitics the result was not only a costly
j failure for the Germans but a suc
! cess for the French such as they have
rarely attained.
Fiercest Fighting of War
The Germans suffered so heavily
that they ceased further attacks while
the French by a prompt counter at
tack re-established themselves again
south of Cumieres and won an im
portant point of vantage on the
southwestern slope of Dead Man
! Hill.
It develops that during yesterday's
battle west of the Meuse the Germans
sef bark the French line between !
j Dead Man Hill and Cumleres for a
1 distance of three quarters of a mile.
The French battalions however, which
I had returned hefoie the unprecedented 1
artillery fire reformed and made a
j desperate counter attack supported by
j reinforcements. After nearly two j
i hours of violent fighting they re
covered all the lost ground. Tha in-!
fantry fighting In this
described as the fiercest of the war.
Eight Fresh Divisions of
Germans Thrown Into Verdun
Paris, June 1. Verdun is .more
j than ever the central point of the
whole war and critics here are confl- i
, dent that the enemy Is making a su
| preme effort to win a quick success.
[The fighting increases in violence with
