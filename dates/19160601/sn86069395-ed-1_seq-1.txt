' Thieves effected an entrance to Mr.

the cash drawer and several plugs of

DEATH CLAIMS
COL. MOSBY'
Most Famous Confederate
Raider of Civil War Suc
cumbs at Age of 82.
Washington,
. Mosby, the
May 31. Col. John
most famous confed-
erate raider of the civil war, died
here yesterday after a long illness.
He was a native of Virginia and was
82 years old.
Col. Mosby dared death over fifty
years ago when at the head of a band
of a few hundred confederate raiders
he rode up and down the Shenandoah
valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains and cutting off means of
communication. It has been estimated
that he often neutralized the force of
over 15,000 federals in the valley.
Born in Powhattan county, Va., Dec.
6, 1833, and graduated from the uni
versity of Virginia in 1852, he was
practicing law in Bristol, Va., when
the war broke out and he began his
career in the confederate army. He
proved his daring with such effect
that ho became a scout for Gen. J. E.
B. Stuart and led the celebrated raid
around McClellan's army on the Chick
ahominy. In Richmond a year later
he recruited an independent cavalry
troop which became famous cs Mos
by's Partisan Rangers. They became
night riders and the terror of the fed
eral troops. f
Mosby's most brilliant exploit
was the capture of Gen. Stoughton.
On a March night in 1863 he, with
thirty followers, rode through the
federal army at Fairfax Court House,
only fifteen miles from Washington,
where Gen. Stoughton was asleep.
Although surrounded by an army said
to have been 17,000 strong, the rang
ers calmly kidnaped the general, his
staff and many sentries, and turned
them over to the confederate authori
ties at Culpeper without having lost
a man.
SAVED FROM HANGING.
General Grant once later saved
Mosby from hanging, and two foes
of the battlefield became staunch
friends. Mosby stumped the state of
Virginia for Grant during his presi
dential campaign, and was awarded
with an appointment as consul at Hong
Kong, a post which he held for eleven
years. When he returned to the
United States, Mosby called on the
surviving members of his rangers
and, to his astonishment, he found
that a large per cent, of them had be
come ministers. In parting the old i
colonel said: "Well, boys, if you
yankees there will be something to
record on judgment day."

Brasher, Now of Earl

John C. Hooe, for the last fifteen
years, local agent of the Louisville &
Nashville Railroad Co., has been no
tified that the company desires to
transfer him to some other noint on
the system and he has been given the
option of several places. Last winter
Mr. Hooe was placed in charge of the

Mr. tiooe is one ol the cpmpany s
old and valuable employes and the
transfer is understood to be in line
with the L. & N.'s policy of mak
ing changes from time to time. Mr,
Hooe has been here much longer than
any other agent was ever allowed to
stay. He has made the road a very
valuable man and has a large person
al following. The people generally
will regret very much to see him
transferred, though his successor,
who has already been named, is said
to be a most capable man. R. F.
Brasher, agent at Earlington, will be
the new freight agent. The change
will be made next Monday, June 5,
by which time Mr. .Hooc's plans will
probably be made known.

These gains, made during the vic

a momentary success near Gludki,
driving the Russians from a position
and capturing it. The Russians,
however, in a counter-attack, re
captured the position. Near Bouf
chache, the Austrians attempted an.
offensive, but it was put down by the
Russian fire.
TURKISH SITUATION UNCHANGED
On their front in Asiatic Turkey,
the Russians report the situation Jn,
changed. Constantinople says ttoS
near Felahie in tho Kut-el-Amar i re
gion the Turks silenced two H f
guns and took prisoners in a sun
attack.
The Germans are with trio Df. r
ians in the advance into Greek T -donia.

Berlin, was made as a protevvn
against a surprise attack which lU'-- u
tente allies were planning.
Tho total subscritions to the recent
Austro-IIungarian war loan are said
