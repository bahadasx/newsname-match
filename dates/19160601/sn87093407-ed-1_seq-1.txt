Why Not Hike?
WE WERE talking to a doctor friend
today.
He was making plans for the preparedness
parade.
He said he and a lot more of his doctor
pals were going to drive their automobiles
in the parade.
It was fine to see his enthusiasm.
But—
Why ride in an automobile?
Why not walk?
Automobiles will be all right in the pre
paredness parade, it seems to us, for G. A. R.
veterans, and ladies, and such folk, but
there's no reason under the sun that we can
see why any able-bodied man should want
to ride ? .
It isn't much of a sacrifice to get out and
drive your machine down Second ave.
But when you hoof it, you will really feel,
you know, is tho you're doing something.
Try it, Doc. Get out and swing your leg*
to the tune of a good marching air, behind a
flag!
Thomas A. Edison did it in New York.
Mayor Gill, and Judge Burke, and Banker
Hoge, and a lot of those sort of men are
going to do it in Seattle.

DOUBLE GUARDS
ON WATERFRONT;
FEAR VIOLENCE
Striking longshoremen »
today tied up 200 vessels
along the Pacific coast
and precipitated one of
the most serious labor sit
uations in recent years in
Western America.
Nearly 10,000 longshore
men walked out at 6
a. m , their demands for
increased wages having
been refused.
Marine engineers all
along the coast may join
the strike. They have de
ctded to a»k a 10 per cent
raise in pay.
It was stated positively by local
member* of the Murine Engineers'
union thai they wUI no on strike
Mitt *wk. They anticipate no
trouble. It l» said, and expect
their demand* will be granted at
once.
Shipping wa* completely tied up
Thursday and special details of
police patrolled the water front to
prevent violence
Temporary coast headquarters
for the strikers were established
In the Arcade building.
Divert Ships to Vancouvtr
Coast Secretary J. A. Madsen
announced. "Thev are all out on
the American side from Belllng
ham to San Diego,"
The strike has not yet gone Into
effect In Vancouver, B. C. About
half the vessels unloading In Seat
tle were Immediately diverted to
the Dominion port, to avoid trou
ble.
Shipping men declared the strike
would cost Seattle of
dollars dally, and tie up the great
volume of foreign-bound commerce,!
abnormally swelled because of the
war.
13 Vessels Tied Up Here
Thirteen vessels In port here
are tied up because of the strike.
They are: ,
Oeorge W. Fenwlck, Fresno,
Shldxuoka Maru. Alkl. Nome City,
Santa Anna, Dolphin, Redondo,

Umatilla, and Cltv of Seattle
The Admiral Watson, due Thurs
day, will also lie affected, as will
five others due Friday -the Queen,
Admiral Dewey, Mexico Maru,
Havlali and Kulfuka Maru
In n letter to Mayor 011 l from
the Employees' union, in which the
mayor was asked to act as a medi
ator, Secretary Dawson stated
that a 10 per cent Increase in
wage* would be paid to the strik
ers If they would go back to work.
"The government representa
tives of the labor department are
going ahead In an effort to settle
things," the mayor said Thursday,
"so I won't Interfere."
The department of Justice may
send an arbitrator here to attempt
mediation of the strike. It was re
ported along the water front today.
Advices from every port on the
Pacific coast of the United States
and from Alaska show that the
long-threatened strike Is In full
blast.
Says Seattle Is Key
Pickets were thrown out along
the water front by the strikers
Thursday, but no violence had been
rejtorted by the police up to 9 a. m.
"The key to the situation lies
right here 111 Seattle." said Coast
Secretary J. A. Madsen "If the
employers grant our demandp here,
they will be granted all along the
Coast."
The strikers are asking a gradu
ated increase in wages, and as high
as $1.50 an hour for handling ex
plosives.
About lf.o cargo checkers walked
out Thursday In a sympathetic!
strike. They have been receiving
varied wages, and are classed as
■killed workmen.
After the Water Front Employ
ers' aunion had appealed to the de
partment of labor, at Washington,
D. C„ requesting steps toward va»-
dlatlon. Immigration Commlnloner
Henry M. White was Instructed to
offer the government offices.
This was done late Wednesday.
Call Vancouver Men Out?
"The only result so far." said
Secretary' Madsen. "Is that the
union men and the employer* un
derstand that Mr. White is willing
to act whenever either party baa
something to TTe has don*
all any man could do in hla posi
tion."
The striker* declare they will
check the move to concentrate
shipping in Vancouver, B. C, by
calling the strike there when th*
j proper time come*.
Sign Up Strikebreaker*
Agents for the Water Front
I plovers' union are signing up strike
breakers, It wa* announced Thurs
day. and expected to have men at
work before the end of the day.
They expect to house and feed
! the strikebreakers along the water
| front, and protect them from the
picket*, according to W. C. Dawson,
secretary of the employers' union.
No Waterhou*e. Harrison line or
Blue Funnel steamers were In Se
attle when the strike was declared.
Representatives of these com
panies said their ships would all
transfer operations to Vancouver,
n. C.
Port Properties Picketed
Because the steamship companies
deal with the longshoremen direct,
the port commission Is not directly
involved with the association
strikers.
Hut the port commission proper
ties are being picketed bv the
United Dock Workers, who am
also on strike.
"We are being treated by the
union dock workers ns tho we
wire a profit eking Institution,"
said Traffic Manager Higday
Thursday. "No effort hss been
made to consider our case seo
arately.
Will Hire Some Men
"Now that shipping is paralvxed.
we don't need many truck men.
but we have to have some to worn
In the warehouses.
"I have been authorized to hire
men and put them on the monthly
payroll.
"They will only handle stuff In
(the warehouses which was stored
there, and not received from ships,
or meant to be loaded on ships.
Tries to Explain
"We also feel that w e will have
to "lire men to help the rancners
from the islnnds who come In
launches for supplies.
Many of them are small grol
eery store owners who do their
own shipping.
We are willing to pay whatever
scale of wages Is current.
"The dock workers are appaj*.
ently opposed to our action, but
we believe they do not understand
the situation."
Say Agreement It Violated
The employers are basing their
Justification to buck the strike on
failure of the union longshoremen
to keep an alleged agreement,
which, they say, was signed last
September.
It stipulated that a 60-day notice
be given by the longshoremen
whenever they Intended to change
their contract.
Strikers place a different con
struction on this agreement.
The central labor council voted
Wednesday night to give the strik
j mg longshoremen their moral nup-
I port.
The executive board of the cen
tral council said the strikers' ac
tion was In ronfllct with their
agreement, but Justified indorse
ment on the ground that the strike
was not merely local, but Involved
the whole Coast.
