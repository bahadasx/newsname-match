Adrisistratioa Not to Order
Withdrawal as Requested
by Carranza, but Will Later
Seed Hh a Wiba Note
Washington, June 1. There will
be no withdrawal of American troop
from Mexico at Carr ansa's request
Instead the administration will Issue
a statement, probably within a week
or 10 days, Informing Oarranxa of
rejection of his request, and calling
attention to mis-statements of fact
about the Mexican situation contain
ed In bis latest withdrawal demand.
In framing the tatement, officials
will go on the theory that the general
tenor of the not 1 fiercer than th
actual convention . text; that It V
chiefly a document for home con
sumption. It irill take Issue with
Carranxa's clahn that the Mexican
government did not know American
force were crossing th boundary In
pursuit of Villa until day after the
hunt started.
" T
It will declare there waa no agree
ment between General Scott and
Obregon not to send a second expe

President Wilson's absence from
town tomorrow will delay cabinet
consideration of the question until
Tuesday.
One of the first step in consider
ation of the situation today was a
conference between Counselor Polk
of the state department and General
tScott. Judge Douglas, attorney for
jthe embassy here, Just back from a
.visit to Carranea, declared Carransa
i and his backer do not want a claah
j with the United States, realising that
It would mark the end of their rule
in Mexico.
I COIUITTEE
EST OF DELEGATES
mitted. Hughes' managers were ex
pected to watch closely the contest
from Georgia, , affecting seventeen
delegates. One delegation, headed
by National Committeeman Henry S.
Jackson, la aligned with the Old
Guard and is ordered to vote for
Senator Weeks on the first ballot,
It seated. The contesting delegation,
backed by State Chairman Walter
Johnson, Is believed to be aligned
with Hughes.
The Louisiana contest, Involving
twelve delegates, also has possibili
ties of a fight among Hughes, Roose
velt and the Old Guard. This con
test is based on the inability of ne
groes to gain entrance to the New
Orleans hotel, whore the whites met.
There are two warring delegations
in Georgia, a tangle in Texas involv
ing the technical point of the right
of districts to send two delegates,
and in Virginia, where one Rich
mond district Is Involved, It Is a fight
between the "black and tans'" and
"Illy whites." , . .
I Six delegates-at-large and one dis
trict delegate are involved In the
Alabama contest, probably the first
to be taken up. The regulars In this
contest are claimed by Hughes.
In Oklahoma, where four district
delegates are involved, It is believed
to be a
