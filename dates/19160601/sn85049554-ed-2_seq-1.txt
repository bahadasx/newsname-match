CARRANZA SAYS BROKEN FAITH.
Molds Mexico Never Gave Consent to
Entrance of Americans.
Mexico City, June 1.—Claiming that
the words and protests of the United
States have been entirely in contradic­
their acts and that in spite of
promises noi to Intervene in the affairs
of Mexico soldiers of the United States
in Mexico without the consent of
^the Mexican government and in viola
tion, of Mexico's sovereignty, the Mexl
governrtifnt now asks for the- im
iate wl/fcdrawal of those troops,
ft entrance of the American expe
ditlon after/ the Glenn Springs raid,
v^the note declares, "places in grave dan-
ger the harmony and good relations
sfe which ought to exist between the goy
ernments of the United States and
Mexico."
Mexico Didn't Consent,
The note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after the Co
lumbus incident without permission of
the Mexican government. The act was
not considered one of invasion then
solely because Che United States said
they had misinterpreted the attitude of
the Mexican government.
When the second expedition crossed
the line after the Glenn Springs in
cident, the note maintains, the plea
that this was done with the consent of
the Mexican consul at Del ftio, Tex.,
Is untenable, and that act can only be
considered its one of invasion.
"The Mexican government, therefore.
Invites the. United States to bring an
end to this unaupportable situation,"
note concludes, "and to support its
protestations and declarations of
friendship by an immediate withdraw
al of American troops."
Time to State Case.
Maintaining that the protests'" of
friendship by the United States and
fch^ expressed desire for noninterven
tion have been contradicted bby acts
of the Washington government, the
says the time has arrived when
WaahinxLu* must declare itself clearly
V»
1
and unequivocally as to its future in
tentions toward Mexico.
After reciting the facts which'led
$o the first-crossing of. the frontier by
this American troops after .,the Villa
.raid at Columbus, the note insists that
in contradiction of the word of Gen.
Scott arid Gen.Funston, other expedi
tions crossed the boundary Xtne, thus
violating all the precepts of interna
tional law and' committing an act of
invasion.
Work Pone—Army Stays.
"the American government," says
the note, "has admitted that the
work of the expedition which entered
after the Columbus raid is now over.
But"" in spite of this fact, American
troops still remain on' Mexican soil.
To contend that political disorder in
this country justifies this act of the
Amerifcan military forces is In conflict
with the repeated professions of the
Washington government relative to
noninterference.'
The note points out that much of the
trouble in Mexico- is due "to- the atti
tude of the United States in not pun
ishing conspirators in the United
States who have plotted the downfall
of the present constitutionalist govern
ment, and to the acts of Washington
in refusing to permit the shipment of
arms and ammunitions to enter Mex
ico."
Didn't Know of Move.
"Washington, June 1.—It was stated
•with authority today that American
troops will not be withdrawn from
Mexico until the Carranzlstas demon
strate sufficient strength to protect
the border. President Wilson was
represented today as ready to with
draw the troops when possible but ment had been entered into between
Reviewing the developments after
the Columbus raid, the note says:
"The Mexican government had no
knowledge that American troops had
crossed the border until March 17, and
this came from private sourpes in EI
Paso. This government then directed a
note to the American government stat
ing that inasmuch as noformal agree-
the two governments the Americans
could not be considered as authorized
to send such an expedition."

Opposes Wilson As Mediator.
Berlin, June 1.—James W. Gerard,
the American ambassador, had a hal£

Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, it
was learned today. The Immediate oc
casion for the conference was the.
question of Polish relief but the chan
cellor and the ambassador also dis
cussed topics of more general interest.
Prof. Hans Delbrueck, of the Uni
versity of Berlin, has written an ar
ticle in regard to American mediation
in the war in which he says there Is
something repellant to Germany In the
Idea of accepting President Wilson as
mediator. It Is obvious, he says, that
the sympathies of the president are
with the entente allies. He continued:
'^Moreover, President Wilson, by
Using in h}s speeches expressions
which are insulting, has created an at
mosphere between us which renders a
cordial approchement no longer pos
sible. However, Germany need not
show herself inflexible as the president
has already shown himself so unfriend

short speech jn which he thanked the
court, the prosecutor and his attor
neys.
Dr. Waite said he was sorry for his
crimes. He declared that he hoped that
by surrendering his body for punish
ment, he would compensate In some
degree the deaths ot his victims.
Waite Apparently Cool.
Waite entered the court room with
bead erect, step firm and apparently
cool. He addressed the court with
suave politeness. His voice wavered
as he spoke of his sorrow for his
crime,
'T'fhank the court," he said, "for the
very fair and impartial manner in
which It has treated me. I also thank
the jurors. I feel, their Judgment was
justified.
"My sincere thanks are due to the
prosecuting attorney who was always
nice with me. My counsel also is en
titled to my thanks. He believed 'im
plicitly that I was not guilty.
Asks Forgiveness.
"I ask for forgiveness. I am very
very glad to give my body In return for
the things I have done and I ^lve my
soul freely to rectify my misdeeds. 1
hope it will go on and jotv^ forever to
purge itself."-,,
Waite was taken bick to the Tombs,
where—pcepscratlons, were imade-toTre
move him at once to Slngf-Sing."
Within half an hour Waite was on
board a train for the state prison.
When he was searched this morning

The adjournment came after a con
ference which laated more than three
hours, and after aeveral propositions
had been presented by each side. Sena
tor Allen resumed his speaking tour
today and Mr. Cosson had not aban
doned hi*, so neither candidate jwetf'
present.

Cosson's failure to be present was due
the failure of the conference.
Coseon Proposal Rejected.
Adjournment came after submission
of a resolution of the Cosson commit
tee calling for a canvass of the state
as to the relative strength of tho can
didates. It was proposed to consult
two non-partisan leaders in each
county In the state and to choose for
the candidate the man whose strength
was estimated to be greatest by these
non-partisans. This the Alien commit
tee refused to adopt, claiming that the
time was too short for the canvass
and claiming the only way to settle the
withdrawal was by frank discussion
between the candidates themselves.
