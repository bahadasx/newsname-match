AMERICAN TROOPS WILL
MAIN IN MEXICO
RE-
Until Carranza Proves He is Amply
, Able to Control the Situation,
. Says President Wilson
(Associated Press)
Washington, June 1. It was stated
authoritatively today that the Amer
ican troops would not be withdrawn
from Mexico until the Carranza au
thorities demonstrate that they con
trol the situation sufficient to protect
the American border. A reply to this
effect will be made to Carranza's re
cent note. President Wilson was
represented today as ready to with
draw the American troops when it is
possible to do so, but is determined to
wait the Carranza forces are in con
trol of the situation.
The war department today took
steps to obtain more definite informa
tion as to the dispostion of the Car
ranza troops in Chihuahua. It was
said that the Carranza note prompted
action of military officials without re
gard to the diplomatic phases of the
situation. General Funston has , been
requested by the war department to
outline clearly the situation in Chihua
hua, according to his most recent in
formation, giving the whereabouts of
the Carranza detachments. No anx
iety is felt for'the safety of General
Pershing's columns.

. San Antonio, June 1. Gen. Funston
in a formal statement today denied
that future crossing the Mexican
border by American troops in pursuit
of raiders was discussed at the El

PLANS FDR THE
I
Ocala, When Its Water and Electric
Works are Complete, Will be
Excellently Equipped
When the new $100,000" light and
water plant is completed, Ocala "will
have one of the most unique plants in
the United States, and one of the best
equipped plants in' the South. The en
gineering records show no other in
stance in thiscountry where an oil
engine is operated in direct compe
tition with a steam engine and requir ed
to meet identical conditions, and
the eyes of the engineering world
will watch this competition to see
what the results are. The plans f o
the plant were prepared in accordance
with the rules and requirements of
the National Insurance Underwriters.
These points concerning the " new
plant were made by Mr. David IJen
ney, of the firm of Twombly & Hen
ney, the city's engineers in the case,
in answer to, questions of a Star rep
resentative. Mr. Henney reached the
city yesterday afternoon, to arrange
for the starting of work on the plant
and 'make ra.h alterations in the plans
a? will be necessary in placing the
plant in the center of the waterworks
block, and placing the standpipe in
the southwest corner of the block.
This morning, accompanied by Presi
dent Nash of the council iild Mr. D.
W. Davis, Mr; Henney went over the
waterworks property. Like Mr. Twom
bly, Mr. Henney is a quiet and most
pleasant gentleman, and answered
questions readily and gladly. - .. -
In discussing the criticisms recent
ly made against the De La Vergne
engine, , that will form a part of the
new station's equipment, Mr. Henney
stated that this oil . engine was one of
two oil engines that have been tested
in the laboratories of the insurance
underwriters under the direction of
the National Board of Underwriters
and found to be satisfactory. And
later in his room at the Ocala
House, the engineer pointed out to the
Star's representative a statement of
the fact in a bulletin of the under
writers' laboratories. Mr. Hennev
said that, of course, this did not mean
that all other oil engines failed to
meet the tests of the underwriters, but
meant merely that of the engines
tested these two were approved.
Mr. Henney reiterated the fact that
in the new plant no one unit of ma
chinery Will have to be depended on
to give the city adequate fire protec
tion. .
Asked what was the prime reason
for placing, an oil engine in the speci
fications, Mr. Henney said that it was
done because of a decision of council.
He said that in the original plans
submitted by his firm twb steam en
gines were provided for) Council had
these plans changed so as to include
in the plant an oil engine, ' believing
as a majority did, that an oil engine
would make for greater economy. Mr.
Henney stated that the first cost of
the oil engine would be greater than
that of a steam engine. It remained
to be seen, he said, Whether or not
the oil machine would : prove more
economical than the, steam, but that
in any event the oil and steam engine
combination would, underguarantee,
have to give just as economical ser
vice as if the two steam engines had
been adopted. It is this test that will
be watched with great interest. ;
'With reference to the water supply,
Mr. Henney said that the plans pro
vided a pressure of 72 to 77 pounds
at the plant, with a pressure of 50
to 62 pounds at the highest point in
the city. This, he said, will take care
of any ordinary requirements for fire
purposes. If necessary, direct pres
sure can be put on the mains up to
as much as the mains will stand. And
in answer to a question, he said that
in the high pressure system of New
York City about 60 pounds was used
Mr, Henney -has a letter from Will
iam Tj Price, manager and chief en
gineer of tne power department of the
De La Vergne Engine company, stat
ing that the DeLa Vergne engines at
the plant of the Daytona 5 Electric
Light & Power company are working
entirely satisfactorily. These Daytona
engines have been under discussion in
the recent criticisms. ;
"We would recommend," says the
letter m, part, "that the council at
Ocala appoint a committee to go down
and see the engines in operation and
talk with Mr. Scholtz, president of the
company." .
"In June, 1913," the letter says
further," we , sold this company one
PLAN
60 h. p. 'FH' engine. In November,
1914, we sold it two 100 h. p. engines,
which contract, by the way, contem
plated the" return of the original 60 h.
p. engine, as this was too small a unit
to fit in with their growing demands.
"In June, 1915, the Daytona Elec

VIOLENCE OF BATTLE
Hi VERDUN
Shows No Sign of Slackening, But
French Have Again Blocked the
German Advance
(Associated Press)
London, June 1. The great battle
at Verdun shows no signs of slacken
ing in violence. The latest official re
ports, however, record no further Ger
man advances. The center of the
fighting has shifted to the southwest
of the f ront between Cumieres and
Dead Man's hill, where the Germans
have scored their most recent gains.
Dead Man's hill or that vicinity is the
scene of the latest infantry fighting.
The Germans attacked the French
here last night but were completely
repulsed, Paris asserts. The German
defeat followed the French capture
yesterday of a fortified position
southwest of the hill.
Unofficial Paris reports point to the
growing , intensity i, of the Verdun
struggle. All reports declare, how
ever, that despite tremendous Ger
man efforts the French first line west
of the Meuse is still unbroken and the
Germans must make further gains
before they can force the main issue
by carrying the battle to the opposite
bank of the Meuse, where the Bras-Douaumont-Vaux
line bars a direct
advance upon the fortress.
In a spirited infantry attack yes
terday the French captured the Ger
man positions on the southwest slope
of Dead Man's hill, northwest of Ver
dun. , Many prisoners and machine
guns were taken.
AUSTRIANS CONTINUE TO AD
VANCE
Continued Austrian gains southeast
of Rovereto, through Schio, Arsiero
and Asiago are recorded. The Ital
ians admit a withdrawalalong some
sectors on this front but there is no
breach ; in the main line of their de
fense' barring' the way to the Vene
tian plain. . 1 . , '

TO ,THE VOTERS OF MARION
COUNTY
As you are aware I am a candidate
for re-election to the office of sheriff
of this county, and I shall gratefully
appreciate your support in the , pri
mary next Tuesday. I shall esteem
your vote as a renewal of your con
fidence of my efforts to discharge the
duties of this trust faithfully fear
lessly, impartially and in a sane an?
conservative manner.
. I have large experience in the dis
charge of the grave responsibilities
of this office and my friends are par
tial enough to say that the record that
I made while sheriff of Sumter, Lake
and Marion, when the two former
were regarded as border counties, is
a record of which anyone might well
feel proud.
I confess that I am proud of thi3
record and if this office is again com
mitted to my hands, I promise that
I shall, if possible, be more vigilant
than ever in the enforcement of every
law on the status books of the state.
The county having been voted "dry,"
I promise that it shall remain so as
long -as I occupy the sheriff's office.
All "blind tigers," and all places
where liquors are sold in violation of
law, will.be relentlessly hunted down
and the offenders brought to speedy
justice. '
And the laws along all other lines
shall be a rigidly enforced. I feel
that my record stands a3 a guarantee
that the above are not mere idle and
boastful promises. I feel that I can
say no more.
Again returning thanks for past fa
vors and feeling that I deserve a con
tinuance of your kindly regard, I shall
feel most grateful for the same.
I am, Very truly yours,
