U. S. BROKE FAITH, CHARGE

LATEST EXPEDITION IS VIOLATION
OF SOVEREIGNTY, SAYS CARRANZA
"This government must consider this last act fthe Langhorne
expedition] a violation of its sovereignty, and thus asks in thc most
urgent manncr that thc Washington government consider with carc
the casc, and once for all define with cxactitude thc policy it intends
to pursue with respect to the Mexican nation.
"Thc cxplanation given by the Arr.erican government in regard
to thc crossing of troops at Columbus has ncvcr been satisfactory
to the Mexican government, but thc ncw invasion of our tcrritory
is no lirger a;i isolated act, and tends to convince the Mexican gov?
ernment that something morc than a mere error is irolved.
"The Mexican government undcrstands that in the face of the
unwillingness of thc American government to withdraw the above
forccs it would bc left no other resource than to procure the derence
of its tcrritory Hy means of arms. But it undcrstands at the same
time its duty to avoid as far as possible an arr.-.ed conflict between
the two countries, and, acting in accordance with the treaty of 1848,
it considers it its duty to resort to all means of a peaceful character
to f'ind I solution of the intcrnational conflict in which both countries
