A TEST.
A professor in the University

should consider them educated in
the best sense of the word, when
thev would say yes to every one
of fourteen questions he should
put to them. It may be oi inter
est to you to read the questions
Here they are:
Has vour education given sym
pathv with all good causes and
made vou espouse them?
Has It made you public-spiri

Has it made you a brother to
the weak?
Have you learned how to make
friends and keep them?
...
Do you know what it is to be a
friend yourself?
Can vou look an honest man or
a Dure woman straight in tne

Do you see anything to love in

Will a lonely dog follow you in
the street?
Can vou be high-minded and

Do vou think washing dishes

Are you good for anything to

Lexington Dispatoh.
A few days ago a very eminent
artist who visited Lexington
made this remark. "I have been
through every country in Europe
and I lived for fifteen months in
the northern part of the United
States. I have only been in the
South for a few months, but I
have seen enough of its wonderful
climate, its matchless beauty and
th gentility of its people to
make me love this section more
than any place in the world.
There is so much hope in the fa
ces and hearts of your people.
You have lost the stohdnesstliat
characterized the fifty years fol
lowing the war between the eta
tea. You have set vour faces
now toward the future, without
forgetting any of the finer things
of the old South. The average
(Southerners has a whole lot of
art in his being, and I am sure
that the best field in the world
for the musicians is here in the
South. Your people should re
ligiously cultivate and guard all
thebeautitul sentiment and by
all means avoid becoming com
mercialized. Do not let a dollar
get between you and your love
for the beautiiul and make your
souls small and your ideals nar
row.'
Just a year ago Dr. Walter
Damrosch said in Raleigh: "1
am sure that the hour has come
when America shall take the same
commanding lead in art tbatshe
has in business and finance over
the nations of Europe, and I re
gard the South as the best field
(or music in this nation." Since
then Dr. Damrosch has shown
his faith in his prediction by con
necting himself with the largest
musical enterprise in America to
be located at Black Mountain.
Many other noted musicians are
each year coming to the South
to make their homes. The great
stars are beginning to visit this
section. Just a few weeks ago
Raleigh paid $10,000 to opera
singers and the venture was a
success. People from all sections

Always MakiocOver.
What interests my thought
more than anything else about
the Uuited States is that it has
always been in process of being
made over ever since that little
beginning and there have always
been the same elements in the
process. At the outset there was
at the heart of the men who led
tne movement for independence
a very high and handsome pas
sion for human liberty and free
institutions. And yet there lay
before them a great continent
which it was necessary to Bub
due to the uses of civilization it
they were going to build upon it
a great state among the family
of nations. I heard a preacher
once point out the very interest
ing circumstance that our Lord's
prayer begins with the petition
for "Our daily bread" from which
lie drew the inference that it is
very difficult to worrhip God on
an empty stomach, and that the
material foundations of our life
are the first foundations. Whatl
want to call your attention to is
that this country ever since that
time has devoted practically all
of its attention, perhays too
much of its attention, to the ma
terial foundations of its life; to
subduing this continent to the
uses of the nation and the build
ing up of a great body oi wealth
and material power. I find some
men who when they think of A
raerica do not think of anything
else but that. But, my friends,
there have been other nations
iubt as rich and just as powerful
in comparison with the other
nations of the world as the Uni
j ted States is, and it is a great
deal more important that we
we are going to do with our pow
er than that we possess it Pres

The habit of industry and love
of work are essential for success
in any vocation to make a well'
rounded life. Unnfortunate is the
boy or girl who has been reared
in luxury and idleness, and who
has not been impressed with the
dignity of labor. I think it was
President Eliot of Harvard Uni
versity who stated in a notable
address, that it was necessary
for every child I o have perforin
ed m youth a certain proportion
of manual labor. They must have
experienced the weariness of tDil
and thrill which comes from the
completion of a physical task well
performed. Such children receive
not only the training, but they
acquire a sympathetic interest in
the man whose daily life is one.o
toil. Besides, there is a harmoni
ous connection between the brain
I and the body, so that intelligent
labor makes easy the raenta
task. Fortunate are ihe grown
men and women who under wise
discipline have learned to labor
with their hands. They are bet
ter fortified against the enerya
ting temptations of life and bet
ter equipped for their vocation.
