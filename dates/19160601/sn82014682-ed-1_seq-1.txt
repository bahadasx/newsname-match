boom of kill Cot Roosevelt's chances
and are. now quietly grooming Ex-Sen
ator Root to oome in a the last mo

The World also published some In
teresting comment on the activities of
Frank HJ Hitchcock," who Js: now In
Chicago apparently hjeading- the Hugh

"By bringing up Root tiie managers
of the party have two chances to win.
One Is to force the band of the Colo
nel and. extort the sortrof terms they
will demand; the other , to put over
Root if 4hey can finally dragoon, the
Colonel Into' accepting,,' him, or as a
third alternative compel ; the Colonel
to throw the weight qf his influence
to a man acceptable to the Root and
Hughes following McCall, Hardinav
Fairbanks. Wads worth, who seem to
be the most likely of the-entries with
but records- of f ensive to either faction.
"The 'basis of the Root strength is
the South, plus the professional fin
ancial interests buttressed by 'Big
Business. The recent ; activities in
the South of the resourceful organiza
tion engaged in promoting the boom
for Mr. Root has brought to light the
fact that a good many delegates from
that section of the country have keen
