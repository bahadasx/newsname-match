PERFECTS NEW ST STEM ,
FOR MARKING HIGHWAYS )
I State Department of Agriculture Will
Make Auto Traveling Easier
?Work Starts This
Week. g
Columbia, May 29.?Plans for a new
system of marking the main arterial
highways of South Carolina have been
perfected by the state department of
agriculture, commerce and industries
and will be put in operation, beginning
this week. The telegraph po'es M
along each road out of Columbia will *
be marked in distinctive colors, visible ^
da) and night, along their entire route
o* the main roads Jn this state so that j
there will be no olia.uj of autoists ! Pu
losing their way. ;
"Commissioner E. J. Watson says tli
that this system was first inaugurated fo
in Connecticut whefe it proved such or
a success that it was extended to the ^
entire length of the Lincoln and the
Transcontinental highways. Later e(
XI ft
the system was adopted by the state tu
of California. ve
The old state road will be the first toto
be marked. Commencing at the In'
state house and ending at Charleston, ^
telegraph or other poles along the en- Bi
tire route will be marked with broad J c
bands of white and blue with the ini- jn}
tial "S" in black painted in the cen- an
ter. At Junctional and cross roads the tal
nameB of the nearest towns and their id(
distances will be printed on a plac- UP
ard and the direction which to take
will also be given. As quickly as pos- J
sible the Washington-to-Atlanta high- tio
way running from Augusta through . ?j
Columbia, Camden and Cheraw to tJc
Rockingham, N. C., will be marked of
with red, white and blue bands with pa
the initial "W conspicuously painted tin
in black, red and white bands} upon ho
which will be superimposed the ini- sal
tial "A" will mark the new Appalachcit
ian highway from Columbia to the '
coi
mountains. The initial "P" upon a fir(
field of green and white will designate
the Peidmont highway from Col)mibia nix
to Greenville. Aa swm as praqtlca- re?i
bie Uia.'StaTtr ot agrlCU
ture, commerce aod industries, will !>ii
extend the marking system from Cam- er
COl
den into the Pee Dee section to Georgese<
town, distinctive appropriate colors jllt
to be used. pr,
At the state house will be erected a coi
sign showing the routes and distances '"1
to all the principal towns in the
state and the road to take and the (l])
color to follow also will be designated, tin
Commissioner Watson says that he in,'
has taken up the matter of placing to'
markers showing the places of his- ?1
toric interest along the various high- lo<
highway nearest an historic spot tell "
Daughters of the American lievolu- tll(
tion already have responded. The Su
plan is to have a sign at a point on a tin
highway nearest an historis spot tell sa
where the place is, its claim to fame inl
and the route and distance to it.
m:
Col. Watson says that the new sys- ...
I a
tern will take some time for comple- ^
tion, but when finished will be of un- an
told benefit to automobilists, particularly
to tourists unfamiliar with the i
road system of South Carolina. He ?
is of the opinion that it will not only ^
cut down much delay and vexation in j
traveling^ but will make the highways j
of the state more and more attractive j
to folk from other sections of the j
country. | .
In connection with the new system '
of marking the highways, the state
department of agriculturej commerce ll01
and industries is getting out an en- ^e,
larged edition of the map of South
Carolina, which is issued annually.! jiQ|
The new map will be the most com- 1 0lplete
of its kind ever issued in this , ,
state and will contain data not hith- I
erto carried. Commissioner Watson !
| i%.a
contemplates, in addition to having ! n)c
every highway and road in the state ,,{
distinctly traced, to show the town- t|,.
ship lines in each county?a job of; raj
such labor requiring accuracy and tje
precision of detail, that i: takes a 0f
long time to complete. The commie- u j
sioner says that he has the co-oper- au,
ation of the county supervisors and co
the county engineers in the work; but n;t
there has been some delay in getting ai,
the required imorinauon mat is nec- in*
essary. As soon as this information 1 an
is assembled, he stated, the work of tildrafting
the map, engraving and print- ]
ing it can be speedily done. There ; a
are some 10 counties of the state yet mi
to be heard from, he said, and he sent tlm
out a hurry call for the remaining NV
data today. As ?oon as this is re- t??
ceived the map will be rushed to com- <li>
pletion. cni
Col. Wfctson says that he daily is 1
in receipt of calls for the latest state ,l"
map. which cannot be supplied be- SI"
cause of the necessary delay in the U1
compilation of the data wanted. When 1
completed the state map will be giv-1
en free.

Swiss Captain Tells Congress of Benefits
of Military Training
The threefold strenghth of the
J Swiss system of obligatory military
training is that it provides adequate
defense, that it increases the individual's
efficiency beyond its cost?
'and that it does not cultivate a mili*
taristic spirit in the nation.
To give it further light on the
system the senate committee on
military affairs called as a witness
D, Theodore Christen of Cincin-1
nati, a former captain in the Swiss '
citizen army. i
"What, if any, effect, does it have |
? upon the efficiency of the man in in-'
Q dustrial and commercial life?'" in- j
a quired Senator Beckham,
d "I think, senator, it has a good
v effect," answered Dr. Christen. "A
man in the army gets his rating.. An ;
army^ if it amounts to anything, Is '
^ a training school for the individual. j
I. If he makes good it is acknowledged: j
s if he does not make good he shows 1
i- it. If he does not make good in the {
I- array his rating in civilian life is in'
ferior considerably."
"Does this system interfere much
^ with industrial life injuriously?" I
^ asked Chairman Chamberlain; "that
>. is, does it take men out of the busie
ness and industrial life and interfere
i- with business?"
"No, senator, it does not: The
f fact that the original training ser11
vice of 67 days is in one year?that
h is, the 20th year?and that there?
; after the man has for about seven
years only 13 days, lessens what
might be an interference."
!, Does Jiot Disturb the Industrial
i* Fabric.
* "It takes him out of industrial life}
'* ireally at a time before he begins?"
"YeSj before he begins; that is, he
}) knows years before that he has to
d put aside 67 days in that year, and all
the arrangements are made. He is
i> not very far advanced at 20 in any
e pursuit. If the man is an employe,
many employers pay them part of
[' their wages. All employers keep their
places open. There is really no
, hardship, and it does not disturb
* jr'.Way ,ti?
?. country."
"Does this Swiss system have the
' effect of cultivating an aggresive or
1 offensive military spirit, or is it a
" policy which creates a patriotic spirt
it and one of defense simply?" asked
\. the chairman.
"It does not create that spirit of
>1 aggresion. I think it curbs it to a
certain exeent. A man who has been
an actual soldier?that is, has trainit
( ing and seen the effect of weapons
and seen the difficulties and dangers
a to which a soldier is exposed?loses
the desire to expose himself, if he
i- does uot have to, to any such danger.
e It has a sobering effect^ according to
* my knowledge."
Compares Swiss Plan With Our National
Guard.
e Dr. Christen is especially capable
y. of comparing the Swiss compulsory
system with our American plan of a
' volunteer militia, for he holds an honn
orable discharge from the Ohio ua^
tional guard.
"I entered that some years ago to
- see what it amounts to," he said. "I
^ have seen what it amounts to after
J having been a Swiss officer. While
the spirit is very good?I want to
u speak highly of it?it is inadequate.
^ "It provides for inadequate train^
ing, for absolutely no reserve. These
uuits are practically in the air; they
^ are not attached to any division; they
j ^re uot attached to any army corps;
' they never see the man who would
t eventually lead the whole body of
Is them. They have u great many other

Volunteer Plan Unfair, Says Former
Cincinnati Mayor,
j Former Mayor Henry T. Hunt of
Cincinnati, who immediately followed
Dr. Christen, emphasized the chief '
weakness of the volunteer plan. The j
u Swiss system, he said, is democratic,:
but "the unfairness of the volunteer
system must be obvious to any man.
s "Why," asked Mr. Hunt, "should I
?. cx?ect another man to voluuucr and
r risk his life and expose his family to (
want, while I remain at home and j
>0 amass perhaps a fortune, leaving my
L> children well off, while his children
.,1 perhaps are reduced to poverty? It
strikes me that every man who is an
?0 American citizen^ every man who has ,
r- the right to vote and control or affect
n the policies of his government, should
"bear his part of its responsibilities; j
i; he should be willing, and he should
r- be trained to meet whatever may offer.
A part of what is sure to offer

the most intelligent classes of the cont'd
munity, the most unseltish, the most
enthusiastic, the very blood we ought
to try to retain in being, and sends !

careless and the ignorant remain a
home to reduce the efficiency of succeeding
generations."
I Universal Training Increases National
Efficiency.
Mr. Hunt dwelt upon the efficiency
! phase of universal training and quot!
ed from Henry C. Emery, who was a
member of the tariff commission appointed
by President Taft, as follows:
"The efficiency of factory labor in
Germany has been greatly increased
< through the military education, and
the young men who have been
through this military training become
much more efficient in later years
than they would have been had they
not been obliged to take this training."
Advocates of compulsory training
in this country want the benefits of
German discipline without the evils
of Prussian militarism. They contend

be propagated in a republic; that German
militarism is a product of the
Prussian type of absolutism in govern- *
rnent and does not spring at ail from '
military training. And in proof of
that belief they point to Switz- * ..
land, to France and to Australia, and ' *
to our own experience when we went

No Trace of Pellegra at Epworth Orplumage.
Columbia, May 2ti.?"Our unanimous
opinion is that there is no pellagra at
the Epworth orphanage at the present
time," said Joseph Goldberger, ItL D.,
surgeou, .Uuited States public health
service, who hus been iu charge of the
dieting of the 225 children in the orphansince
the government took
111, . .
vlntter, M. D., surgeou, and K. M.
Grimm, M. D., past assistant surgeon,
United States public health service,
who were sent to Columbia by the surgeon
general to inspect the conditions
at the orphanage.
When Dr. Goldberger and W. F.
Tanner, M. D., surgeou, began their
supervision of food given the children
there were more tnuu so cases or pellagra
at the orphanage, some advanced
and others insipient.
"It is not/.' said Dr. Goldberger,
"that the children do not get enough
to eat or that the food is not wholesome;
it is merely that the diet was
not balanced. There is no medication,
whatever. We have fed them
principally on milk, lean meat and
cowpeas, and given them less starchy,
cereal and sweet foods.
"it should be clearly understood
that the children are not cured for the
rest of their lives, for an unbalanced
diet will bring the pellagra back."
