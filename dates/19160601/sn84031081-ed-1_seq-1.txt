trial of the disbarment proceedings
against Hie two attorneys which has
been in progress here all thin week.
The respondents were pluced on the
stand at the close of a day which had
been Riven up to the hearing of expert
evidence in their behalf, intended to
prove that the questioned letters vvre
not written on a typewrlt'en in their
office. This evidence hud been u

cal mutters regarding the identity of
questioned documents, intermingled
with certain semi-humorous ex
changes between counsel and witness
on crow-examination, and the little.

replied to this letter, asking that oit.h-d

dated September 23, 1910, from the

day are identically as they were at
the time they wore received by his

fication by court officials.
"Mr. Wood," said Judge Wright..
"Mate whether you wrote these four
letters, or any of them, or whether
they were written in your office, or
whether you know anything at all

and stated that when the Idea was
first suggested hla firm did everything
In its power to ascertain the truth re
garding the matter. He first learned,
he said, from the late E. C. Hurke,
postmaster of Santa Ke, that it was
possible to identify the machine on
wnien a document was written by pe
culiarities of the writing, and he made
every effort to locate the typewriter
on which the four disputed letters
were written, even going to New York
and instituting u search through the
Underwood Typewriter company, and
a number of, its agencies, to ascertain
the whereabouts of this machine. On
the occasion of his visit to the New
York office of the Underwood Type
writer company, he said, he learned
that the plus minus sign appearing on
one of the disputed letters was ex
ceedingly rare, being in demand only
by those engaged in higher mathe
matics or engineering; that not one
Underwood machine In fifty thousand
had this character, and that it was so
little in use that the Underwood peo
ple did pot manufacture it. but had
it specially made when there was a
demand for it. Failing to get any re
sults from a search through the Un
derwood Typewriter company, said
Mr. Wood, his firm had employed de
tectives In the effort to solve the mys
tery, but without results, and he final
ly had been forced to the conclusion
that cither Klias Uurrla. carried his
own typewriter with him, or thuL the
letters were fabricated. At this point
Judge Pope asked Mr. Wood if he
had been able to obtain any evidence
that Garcia had carried his typewrit
er with him, and the witness replied
that the only evidence which he had
been able to obtain was that Garcia
had been teen using a typewriter in
the lobby of the Kaiserhof hotel In
Chicago, where only the stenographer
was allowed to use the hotel machine.
Neither Mr. Wood nor Mr. Matron
wsre cross-examine 1 by the eonwilt
tce.. . Albert H. Oshorn, the foundation of
whoso evidence as an expert was laid
at the afternoon session yesterday,
took up practically the entire day to
day, giving his reasons for the opin
ion that the questioned letters and
the '.wo "standard" documents were
written on three separate typewriters.

on Porsident Wilson's orders.
The thinly veiled threat in the note
that failing withdrawal after due ex

in Mexico might expect attack by
Mexican (roups, left army officers un
