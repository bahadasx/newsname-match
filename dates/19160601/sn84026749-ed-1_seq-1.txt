Question of Whether Boom Will
Be Smashed Looms Over
Everything Else.
CHECKED NOW, FOES ASSERT
But Their Opponents Declare
Their Cause Has Yet To Be
Weakened in Least.
CHICAGO, Juno 1. Looming
WITH
i
up above all other questions in
Chicago today is this:
i . Will the Hughes boom be batter
ed to pieces by the concerted drive
against it?
For the presept, the whole polit
ical situation with respect to the
outcome of the conventions next
week revolves about this.
It continues to be a
Hughes against the Held,
midable nature of the
case of
The for-
Hughes
movement is plainly recognized.
That is why the batteries of the
Roosevelt chieftains and the lead
ers of the "allies," as the favorite
sons are called, are so heavily di
rected against it.
FORBIDS USE OF HIS NAME.
Tho managers of tho Hughes cam
paign, who havo been Instating that
they could speak with posltlvencss that
he would accept, were confronted today
with a letter Justice Hughes had
written to B. C. Stokes, a prominent
IteDUbllcan of New Jersov.
0 Mr. Blokes sent tho Justice a cop
' of the Interview haihad had with Ilabbl
Wise and asked him If It expressod his
lewa. Thls was a year ago.
Tho Justice replied: "I think my
statement covered the ground. it
seems to me very clear that, as a mem
ber of the Supreme Codrt, 1 have no
right to be a candidate either openly or
passively. I cannot remain working
here and hold an equivocal position be
fore the country. I must, therefore,
ask that no steps be taken to bring my
name beforo the convention."
The Hughes headquarters was silent
on tho letter.
That the Hughes Doom has to some
extent been halted Is the prevailing
belief here. But It has by no means
been put out of action, although some
of the anti-Hughes leaders confidently
say they have him beaten.
On tho other hand, tho Hughes lead
ers assert their cause has not been
weakened In the least.
Neither of these these things appears
to bo the exact truth.
T. It's Strength Increases.
The tremendous activity of Colonel
Roosevelt and the men working for
him has served to Increase his
strength. His speeches are apparently
Impressing the country profoundly,
and will tend to add to his vote In the
Republican convention.
At this moment, there Is nothing
like the majority to nominate the
Colonel In sight. But there Is being
created a psychological condition
which will grow more Intense as tho
time for the convention draws near,
which, the Colonel's admirers be
lieve, will make all paper calculations
worthless and result In a sweeping
stampede to the former President.
It has all along been the plan of the
Hughes leaders. If possible, to nomi
nate Hughes on tho second or third
ballot. The efforts of tho Roosevelt
leaders and the managers of the fa
vorite sons havo been directed, flrst,
to eliminating Hughes from tho lleld
If possible; Becond, If he cannot bo
eliminated, to preventing a rush to
him In the early balloting.
Frank If. Hitchcock nnd other Hughes
men today continued to assumo their
air of confidence that their plans had
not been disarranged, and that Hughes
would be named early In tho struggle.
But there nro distinct symptoms that

Asserts Preparedness Campaign Cannot Be
Measured in Terms of Three or Four
Months Work Before Election and
Should Not Be Drawn Into Politics.
By THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
Copyright, UK, by M etropolltan Magazine.
The preparedness campaign cannot be measured in terms of three
or four months' work before election. Too many politicians who believe
in the flintlock theory of statesmanship are looking at the subject only
from the standpoint of vote-getting. They timidly weigh the proba
bilities and try to figure out whether tho support of this group or that
group can be secured. Theirs is the spirit which will not look even si
months into the future; it is the spirit which leads to compromises and
half-measures, and compromises and half-measures in national prepar
edness mean national disaster. Only strong men, only statesmen, only
political parties that arc willing to take a stand unalterably for a great
principle can serve our nation today. The victory that must be won
at the polls means unremitting work until 80 or 00 per cent of our
population lends its whole-hearted support to the effort. There must
be broad majorities in the lower house of Congress, in the United
States Senate, and in State legislatures, all convinced and ready to
support to the end the great constructive policy which will tax our na
tional energies as no governmental task of organization that we have
ever before undertaken has done. It is a task that will require the
energies of hundreds of statesmen, of hundreds of leaders who have
organizing ability. We have some such men in Congress. We have
some such men outside of Congress. We need many more.
Once the thought of preparedness is accepted by the voters and
has the houses of Congress behind if, the task is but begun. There
must be at the outset an administration that recognizes the extent of
the problem, and that has the experience and vision to furnish the
necessary leadership to carry it through. The task that we ask our

PERKINS PAVES WAY HOGAN-MILLER CASE
FOR PARTY REUNION
Moose Leader Says Followers
Will Support Anyone Who
Stands for Progressiveness.
By H. L. RENNICK.
CHICAGO, Juno 1. George W. Per
kins brought tho olive branch to the
O. O. P. again today.
Tho Dull Mooso chieftain, after
greeting Chairman Illlles, of the Re
publican national committee, at tho
Blackstone. announced flatly that the
Progressives will stand on the state
ment they outlined In January, Indi
cating they will support any candldato
not necessarily Roosevelt who
stands for progressive principles.
"I seo In the papers and I heard on
the train while en route here, that a
lot of bitter feeling has boon worked
up between the camps of the different
candidates," Perkins said.
"This Is unfortunate. As far as the
Progressives aro concerned, we will
approach tho conventions In the spirit
we Indicated in our January state
ment. For Americans First.
"This Is pre-eminently tho time when
the conventions should be for Ameri
cans flrst.
"I read In the papers that Carranza,
In his note dollvored to Washington
yesterday, had accused tho Wilson
Administration of duplicity nnd of
misleading tho Mexican government.
It occurs to mo that this was tho flrst
time that any foreign power had
dared accuse Uncle Sam of treachery.
"Our prime object should be, with
all possible speed and certainty, to
stop this sort of thing and restore our
good name."
As Perkins entered the Blackstone
ho shook hands with Chairman Hllles,
of the Republican committee: Senator
Reed Smoot of Utah, one of the old
e-i'nrd. and several othor Republicans.
They chatted Informally and laugh
ingly oxprcssed hopes of getting to
gether. "Thanks for your statement regard
ing tho Republican platform the other
dny," Torklns sold to Hllles.
In this statement Hllles had an
nounced tho Republicans were for
Americanism an3 preparedness, and
that this was tho big Issue.
Hllles told Intervlewors today that he
believed the Progressives and Republi
cans would get together.
"I don't think thoy have changed," he
said. "I believe they were absolutely
sincere In their January statement. I
havo not been assured of this fact by
Colonel Roosevelt, but T do bellovo the
Colonel's followers would accept an
other man If necessary. But, of course,
thoy want the Colonel."
Calls Report False.
Hllles branded as absolutely false a
roport that the national committee
would get together today on a com
promise candidate.
"We'll naturall" talk about things
whenever wo got gethor." he said.
"But wo nro not going to pick anybody
for any office."
Senator Smoot of Utah was equally
optlm'stic.
"Thcro oro SS3 delegates," he Bald.
"All are absolutely free to vote for
anybody they choose. Thero aro no
strings tied to anybody. And anybody
they nominate will win."

SET FOR TOMORROW
Action of National Committee on
D. C. Delegate Fight Still in
Doubt.
CHICAGO, June 1. The national com
mittee, which began hearing contests
today, expects to take up tho District
contest tomorrow.
The Interested parties are on tho
ground, Including Aaron Bradshaw, Rob
ert I. Miller, and Calvin Chaso, who
are the delegates certified bv tho elec
tion board, nnd Prank J. Hogan, Dr.
Wllllston, Julius I. Peyser, ond Henry
H. Flather. Judge Hays also Is hero
as counsel for Miller and Chase.
What course the commlttoo will take
Is doubtful. Suggestions are heard of
seating four of the contestants, giving
each a half vote. Borne little talk Is
heard of throwing out tho District alto
gether, but this Is unlikely.
One suggestion. Is that the Hogan
WIlIiFton delegation will bo refused
seats because Mr. Hogan Is known to
be a Roosevelt man at heart, but Homo
of tho national committee foel that It
would be wlso to seat Hognn and Wll
llston. fearing that if Hogan Is not
seated there will be an outcry that tho
committee Is unfair to the Colonel and
Is going out of Its way to keep votes
from him.
Sidney Blcber is here working for
Hogan.
Hogan Confident

"I am going to Chicago to take my

Should Carranza Attack Them,
He Must Take Consequences
Administration's Attitude.
REPLY NOT TO BE HURRIED
First Chief To Be Told Present
Situation Is Result of Own
Inactivity.
If General Carranxa should attempt
to back up his threats In his now noto
demanding a withdrawal of the Ameri
can forces from Mexico and attack tho
American expedition, he will have to
take tho consequences.
Thy. In 'short, is the attitude or tho
Administration today following a care
ful reading of the communication.
It was stated authoritatively that tho
President has no Intention whatever of
ordering a withdrawal or the troops i

border
has bcon safeguarded permanently
against further raids.
It Is stated as likely that In due time
a statement will bo Issued rcltoratlng
the intentions of the American Govern-
ment and reminding Carranza that had
he not failed to protect the border,
there nover would have been any oc
casion for sending tho troops into
Mexico.
Statements made by Carranza In tho
note as to pledges alleged to havo
been given by General Kcott to Gen
eral Obregon will be challenged as
Xntrue.
Although hlghlv Incensed with tho
tono of tho note, and particularly with
Its suggestion that tho troops ore being
kept In Mexico for political reasons, of
ficials here are Inclined to the belief
that It was written largely for home
consumption.
Ambassador-designate Arredondo is
said to have Indicated as much to
Counselor Polk of tho State Depart
ment on submitting the note.
Apparently the Administration has no
Intention of hurrvlng a reply to Car
ranza. A reply will bo sont. It was said,
"eventually."
Hope in Diplomacy.
It'no attack should ba madoJfh,e State
D',Ml-tineiit will prepare1' to 'continue
diplomatic discussion, holding Pershing's
army In Mexico while the exchanges
nrc In progress.
What was considered the most sig
nificant paragraph of tho note Is that
demanding tho withdrawal of tho
American troops from Chihuahua. This
paragraph says:
"Tho Mexican government understands
that In the fnce of the unwillingness of
the American Government to withdraw
the above forces, it would be loft no
other resource than to procure the de
fonse of Its territory by means of arms,
but It understands at the same time Its
duty to avoid ns far as possible an
hrmed conflict between the two coun
tries." Based on Second Expedition.
When tho Carranza noto was written
the second expedition. led by Colonel
Sibley and Major Langhorne, was still
In Mexico. Carranza's noto charged that
this expedition was sent Into Mexico
In defiance of promises made by General
Bcott at his conference with General
Obregon.

PRESIDENT TO
LEAD PARADE
Take Active Part in Pre
paredness Demonstration to
Bo Held Here.
CABINET IS INVITED, TOO
Committee Which Secured Wil
son's Promise Will Visit All
Department Heads.
President Wilson will march in
Washington's mammoth Prepared
ness Parade on Flag Day, June 14.
The President will walk at tho
head of the parade from the Peace
Monument to the reviewing stand,
in front of the Post off ice Depart
ment building, and then will drop
out of line and enter the stand to
review the thousands of marchers
following.
All the members of the Presi
dent's Cabinet will be invited to
march with him in the parade.
The President voluntarily offer
ed to join the parade when seen at
the White House today by William
F. Gude, chairman; Rudolph
Kauffmann, treasurer, and Charles
J. Columbus, secretary of the ex
ecutive committee for the Prepar
edness Parade.
TENDER INVITATION.
Tho .committee called at the White
House to Invite the President to review
the parade.
"I shall be glad not only to review the
parade, but to march In It," the Presi
dent told the committee.
Tomorrow the committee will call per
sonally on all members of the Cabinet
to Invite their participation.
President Wilson also agreed today to
take under consideration the question of
Issuing an Executive order closing the
Washington Departments all day for tho
Preparedness Parade and Flag Day
program.
Tho Flag Day program on the Wash
ington Monument grounds, when the
President will make an address, Is
scheduled to begin at 3 o'clock. If the
departments were dlsmlssod a't 1 o'clock
as flrst planned, this would not give
sufficient time for the 40.000 Government
workers to participate In the parade.
The President said he would look into
the law to seo whether he had full au
thority to issue such order.
At any rate he assured the committee
that he would permit heads of depart
ments to dismiss all employes desiring
to participate In the parade.
Mark of Distinction. .
The presenco of the President and his
Cabinet as marchers will give the Wash
ington Preparedness Parade a mark of
distinction that has not been held by
any of the parades previously held In
New York, Boston, Baltimore and other
cities.
Washington's Preparedness Parade
will be national In character, where
other parades have been merely local
demonstrations.
June 14. when tho Preparedness Parade
will be held, is the opening day ot the
Democratic national convention at St.
Louis. The participation of the Presi
dent as a marcher In the parade will bo
flashed to convention hall, whero tho
cheers of the Washington thousands
will And a resounding echo.
Washington's clergymen In large
numbers are bent upon co-operating
to make the parade as great a success
an possible.
This fact Is evident as a result of
a review of the mass of correspond
once received nt the offices of the
commlttoo In charge of the arrange
ments for the affair today. Ever
since the sending out of a circular
letter to the clergymen of the District
asking wielr support In the project
several days ago the malls have been
bringing encouraging returns to the
committee. ,

their children nnd othor members of
their families take part.
J. C. McConnoll, State manager of
