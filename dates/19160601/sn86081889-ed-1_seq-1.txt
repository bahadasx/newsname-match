Pleasant Ridge, and a little
daughter Elizabeth aged 14 mo.
Also by her mother, two broth

model mother, and kind to all.
Like Dorcas of old, she will be
remembered by the beautiful
things wrought with her needle,
a3 well as by paintings that adorn
many homes. Mrs. Deshong was
a member of the M. E. church.
She had not been in good health
for some time, and had submit
ted to an operation from which
she did not recover.
Mrs. Baltzer Deshong and her
daughter, ' Mrs. Maud Hollins

Made Long Run.
Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Hocken
berry, of Pitcairn, Pa. left Pitts
burgh at 6 o'clock last Thursday
norning and arrived at McCon
nellsburg at 11:45 less than six
hours run of 134 miles. Mrs.
Hockenberry before marriage
vas Miss Retta Grove daugh
ter of Squire Billy Grove, of
Clear Ridge, and of course stop'
ped to get latest edition of the
News. At 12 o'clock they left
for Duncannon, 15 miles above
Harrisburg, going by way of Get
tysburg. The new Ford touring
car in which they traveled be
longs to Mr. Hockenberry's broth
er G. M., at Duncannon to whom
it was being delivered. They ex
pected to take supper that night
in Duncannon. -
Dwelling House Burned.
Last Friday morning the fami
ly of John Spade residing two
miles northwest of Needmore,
arose early to make ' a trip to
Hancock. A fire wa3 built in
the cook stove and Mr. and Mrs
Spade went to the barn to do the
morning's work there. As they
were about to return to the house
they noticed the flue afire, and
soon the whole upper part of the
building was in flames. They
succeeded in removing most of
the household effects, but the
building was totally destroyed,
We are informed that there wa3
'GOO. 00 insurance, which will help
to make the loss lighter.
Not Good Seed.
Those of our readers who take
liable farm DaDers have noticed
bow frequently they are warned
. lot to "bite" at certain adver
tisementa for seeds that are said
to produce several times more
than anything ever heard of be-fore-they
are fakes intended to
eatyou. The latest is "Turn
'PKape," a recently exploited
Seei that ia said to be of little
value to American farmers.
They Sat in Darkness.
Rev; J. L. Yearick returned
home last Sabbath after having
greatly enjoyed a two-weeks' va
cation in Center county. In the
forenoon, he assisted in commu
nion services at Fannettsburg,
and in the evening he preached
in the Presbyterian church in
McConnellsburg.
About ten minutes after Mr.
Yearick began the services the
ights went out not an unusual
thing for those luminaries to do.
0 no; the congregation die' not
become panicky. They are used
to it. To sit in darkness while
the pastor is preaching is kind o'
rcstfuL If you want to close
your eyes and take a little nap,
you need not fear being seen;
and then, too, it affords an aw-
ul good chance to "hold hands."
Mr. Yearick just went ahead
withjiis sermon as though noth
ing had happened and was almost
through with it w hen the lights
came on again, bmce Air. Year
ick had taken for his theme "The
eautiful Scenes of Early Sum
mer in Pennsylvania" and was
easing his hearers in imagina
tion through the vales and over
the hilh of the old Keystone
state, at this season covered with
beautiful flowers and verdant
foliage his hearers expressed
their regret that the room was
not permitted to remain in dark
ness until the learned preacher
had finished hi? discourse.
C. L. S. C. Banquet
From 8 to 10 o'clock Monday
evening the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Club, of McCon
nellsburg, had possession of the
bigdiningroom at the City Hotel.
t was the occasion of the ban
quet held by the Club at the close
of their year's work. Thirty-one
covers were laid, and the menu
was in keeping with ihe service
of that popular hostlery.
While the membership of the
club consists of about seventeen
member?, each member was per
mitted to invite a friend, and
believe me" no one of the invit
ed guests was sorry that he had
been lucky enough to be invited.
After lingering at the table in
the enjoyment of the many good
things that appeal to the appe
tite, Toastmaster Admiral Smith
in a happy manner introduced
the following speakers: Mr3. C.
B. Stevens, Mrs. Harry Hull, Mrs.
H. L. McKibbin, Miss Minnie
Reisner, Rev. Peterman, Rev.
Yearick, Rev. Jackson and B. W.
Peck.
The papers read by the ladies
named possessed much literary
merit, and the men of course, did
the best they could.
There are many people of Mc
Connellsburg anxious to brighten
up on the studies of their school
days, and acquire additional in
formation, that do not know just
how much they are missing by
not connecting themselves with
this organization.
Bad Smashup.
Walter Elvey whose home 13
west of Scrub Ridge, near Beth
lehem church, and Miss Esther
Thomas, of Back Run, were out
driving last Sunday and drove
down the east side of the Ridge
west of town so rapidly that they
could not make the turn into the
Thomastown road to Mi3S Es
ther's home. Result was a bad
smashup when the horse went
through the fence into Trout's
field, taking with it two panels
of the structure. Roy and Es
ther were hurled into the lower
branches of a tree. .
S. B. WoolletandJohnP.Sipes
arrived on the scene a few min
utes after the accident and the
parties were placed in the latter's
car and taken to the office of Dr.
Robinson where it was found
that the ligamentsof Roy's knees
were injured and Miss Esther's
face and neck were severely
scratched. Later E. R. McClain
took the two young people to
their respective homes.

CIRCULATING LIBRARIES.
Little Talks on Health and fygiene by
Samuel 0. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
A word to the fond mother
about the danger of handling
books in the home from circulat
ing libraries where the organiza
tion is such that it does not re
quire books to be disinfected ev
ery time they are returned from
circulation.
With all the care and energy
of the health authorities, thou
sands of homes in this State are
infected with tuberculosis and it
will continue to be spread all
through circulating libraries un
less the people demand the disin
fection of the looks to destroy
the germs of disease that they
may carry from home to home.
We often see a mother with
her infant in her arms that is be
ing lulled to sleep while the moth
er is reading a book from a cir
culating library.
Tuberculosis is only one of sev
eral diseases that may be com
municated by unclean books.
Tliey Saw New York.
Last Saturday evening, twelve
McConnelushurg citizens went to
Ciiambersburg, took the 11:40
train for New York, arriving in
that city about 7 o'clock next
morning. Without los of time
they proceeded to "See New
York." They soon discovered
that the city covered somewhat
more ground than McConnells
burg and Hustontown put togeth
er, but the walking was good
along the ancient cow paths of
the original Dutch town and by
their agreement that no two pair
of eyes should look at the
same thing at the same time,
they virtually extended the
allotted twelve hours between
excursion trains to one hundred
and twenty-four hour3 not a
bad idea for such occasions. In
that manner the party got good
value for their money.
The twelve sightseers were:
M. W. Nace, Ed D. Shimer, A.
W. Grissinger, J. W. Melktt,
Willis Mellott, W. R. Sloan, B.
C. Lamberson, Harry Snyder,
Max II. Sheets, and Edward,
Ralph, and Clifford Lininger.
The party arrived home -at about
3 o'clock Monday morning, and
after having counted themselves
and taken an inventory of per
sonal belongings, they found they
were all good as new not hav
ing met with a single unpleasant
experience.
Auto I'psct.
Mr. and Mrs. Irvin Keagy and
little son, and Mr. and Mrs.
L. W. Imler all near Woodbury,
Bedford county left home last
Saturday morning at about 4: 1"
in Mr. Keagy's Buick car for
Gettysburg. After having par
taken of breakfast in McCon
nellsburg at about 8 o'clock, the
party proceeded to cross Cove
mountain. When near the top,
they got too close to the edge of
the road while meeting another
car and the Bedford machine
slipped sidewise over the steep
embankment, overturned, and,
fortunately, lodged against a
small true that held it from turn
ing completely over on the oc
cupants. All escaped with slight
bruises and scratches except Mr,
Imler whose back and left wrisfc
were rather badly bruited. One
front wheel of the car was crush
ed.
Gaicg'Some.
' Last Saturday afternoon Ernest
R. McClain made a run in a Ford
touring car from Everett to Mc
Connellsburg in 59 minutes, a
distance of twenty-six miles,
crossing three mountains. He
only dropped into "low" once,
and that was in passing over
some rough stones where work
was being done on the Highway
on the west side of Sideling Hill.
He chased a big Pierce-Arrow
from the Crossings pnd "run him
down" ascending Sideling Hill,
Won Two Medals.
After having attended three
terms at the High School in De
fiance, Bedford County, Miss Do
ra Stevens, daughter of Austin
H. Stevens, of Wells Valley, was
graduated from that institution
May 23rd.
Miss Dora won the gold prize
conveying highest honors of her
class. Nor was that all. She
won a gold medal offered by a
leading magazine for the best es
say on Shakespeare. The Shakes
peare contest was open to the
whole school' and many entered,
and while it is but natural that
some competitors would receive
assistance, Miss Dora claims she
received no help from anyone.
This certainly speaks well for
Fulton county talent, and it also
opens the way to remark that
there is no just reason why Ful
ton county should not have suffi
cient and conveniently located
high schools where every boy
and girl could get the benefit of
an education of that order with
out being compelled to leave
home at a tender age as was the
ca; e of Miss Stevens. It is so
with many others. Summer Nor
mal began at Defiance next day
after High School closed, and
M:rs Stevens is in attendance
with a view to preparing to teach.
It is with pride, that we point to
this instance of success for a Ful
ton county girl. Best wishes,
Dora, and we trust cther3 will
follow your example of determin
ed effort.
iNTERESTED SCHOOL PATRON.
Pleasant Callers.
Mr. and Mrs. John G. Cobbler
and daughter Miss May, Mrs. B.
F. Ross and daughter Miss Edna
and Mrs. T. W. Jones-all of Ell
wood City, Pa., and Mrs. Bruce
W. Spangler, a cousin of Mrs.
Cobler, of McKees Rocks, Pa.,
stopped at the Fulton House for
dinner Monday on their return
from a trip to the Gettysburg
battlefield in a big touring car.
Mr. Cobler and Mrs. Spangler
were very pleasant callers at the
News office. Mr. Cobler wa3
formerly cashier of the First Na
tional Bank of Everett, is now
cashier of the First National
Bank of Ellwood City, Pa., and
he is the nominee of the Demo
cratic party to represent Law
rence county in the legislature.
The Editor takes pardonable
pride in saying that John was a
student jn one of-his summer
normal schools at Rainsburg dur
ing the latter part of the 70's,
and Mrs. Spangler's husband a
student in one of the editor's nor
mal schools in McConnellsburg
near. the close of the nineteenth
century.
Broke Record.
One day last week, Bobby
Hammond passed through Mc
Connellsburg in an Empire car,
bent on breaking the record for
a run between San Francisco,
California, and New York City.
He left San Francisco at 12:01
o'clock noon, May 17th, and ar
rived in New York at 1:59 p. m.,
May 23rd, making the run of
3485 miles at an average speed
of 221 miles per hour, thereby
clipping 25 hours from the best
previous record. He made one
stretch of road in Indiana, 600
miles, in 17 hours.
Bought Farm.
Mac Chesnut who has been liv
ing in the tenant house on the
Pittman farm south of McCon
nellsburg, bought part of what
is best known as the Samuel Oy
ler farm three miles west of town
last week from George Garner
for $800. The tract contains 47
acres with farm buildings there
on. Mr; Chesnut removed to his
new home laet Saturday.
Chas. J. Eagan of Midland,
Md., who has been spending
some time with his friend John
Hann, near Saluvia, called at the
News office Monday morning and
had his label changed to '17.
MAY HONOR ROLL.
Names of New Subscribers and Others
Who Have Paid Subscription Dur
ing Month of May.
While May is a busy month,
the roll of new 'subscribers and
others who did not forget the
printer, is about as long as us
ually. Subscription is supposed
to be paid in advance, but it is
not always convenient for sub
scribers to renew just on the day
the subscription expires, and we
are always glad to extend a rea
sonable credit; but on bills as
small as a year's subscription to
a newspaper, there is little rea
son for letting it run unpaid from
year to year. It is always hard
er to pay a debt of two or three
dollars than a debt of only one.
In fact, the people who miss the
money least, are the people who
pay for a thing when they get it.
No class of business people
have felt the weight of the Great
War more than the newspaper
publishers. The price of paper,
ink, labor and every kind of ma
terial has been advancing from
time to time until many publish
ers find themselves in that posi
tion that they must either ad
vance the price of their paper,
reduce the size, or go out of busi
ness.
The publisher has no way to
stand off his creditors. His bills
must all all be cleaned up at the
end of each week, or at the end
of each month at farthest; and
it is plain that he has no source
from which to get the money,
except from his subscribers and
from those who take space in his
paper for advertising purposes.
We trust that this little "spiel"
will make you think of looking at
the tab on your paper, and if it
has a 15, 14, or a 13 on it, just
get busy and clean it right up,
and you will make us happy, and
take a load off your own mind.

Memorial Day.
Sunday morning, a union meet
ing of the churches of town was
held in the Auditorium of the
High School building in honor of
the G. A. R. The sermon was
preached by Rev. Edward Jack
son, pastor of the M. E. church
of this place. The text "Do this
in remembrance of me" was the
basis of some beautiful thoughts
illustrating the simplicity of the
memorials requested by our Sa
vior for his sacrifice of love in
contrast with the costly material
monumenU erected by ancient
warriors to commemorate their
bloody and heartless deeds of
cruelty. The speaker said in
substance that the annual meet
ing of private citizens to honor
the defenders of our country was
in the line with the spirit of
Christ's teachings.
Nine veterans of the Civil War
were present at the Sunday ser
vices, namely, Scott Hann, Thorn
as Hamil, H. E. Palsgrove,
Abram Runion, S. B. Woollet,
J. W. Hoop, Jame3 Rummel,
James Youse, and Adam Cleven
ger. Every seat in the Audi
torium was occupied by an ap
preciative audience.
May 30th dawned bright and
fair, but soon thereafter, clouds
gathered to the dismay of those
in charge of programs for Deco
ration Day. The sky soon cleared
sufficiently to make the day pleas
ant for the veterans and the
crowds of friends who assembled
to hear the speaking and to wit
ness the placing of flowers on the
graves of comrades.
Notwithstanding the threaten
ing weather, about 400 persons
assembled at Union cemetery at
9 o'clock, an interesting program
was rendered, and address deliv
ered by Parker H, Skinner, of
Chambersburg.
At McConnellsburg at 1:30, the
"Eoys in Blue," headed by the
McConnellsburg Band, marched
to the Auditorium where an audi
ence of more than 400 people had
assembled. The procession of vet
erans was not large only nine,
namely, J. W. Hoop, Thomas Ham
il, Abram Runion, Adam Cleven-
ger, Scott Hann, John Glunt,
James Youse, D. M. Kendall and
H. E. Palsgrove. Prayer was of
fered by Rev. Yearick, a duet was
sung, Lincoln's Gettysburg Ad
dress was read, the Band played,
and then Parker Skinner was in
troduced and delivered an excel
lent address. Rev. Jackson closed
the services with prayer and the
benediction. The several ceme
teries in town were then visited
and the graves decorated.
Our Apology.
It is not a pleasant duty to ac
knowledge faults, but we are
forced to do it sometimes. The
News has recently contracted
the habit of "getting full" ear
ly in each week, and you know
that when a manor any other
creature gets "full" there is
little that can be done until , that
condition wears off. Type-setting
begins Friday, and, of course,
first come first served. This is
our apology for the non-appear
ance occasionally of contributed
articles in the following issue.
We know of no Keeley cure for
this kind of "fullness."
