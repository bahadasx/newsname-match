Winston Churchill Again Criti
cizes Army Administration in
House of Commons.
1.700,000 UNACCOUNTED FOR
Tennant, McKenna and Asquith
Defend Conduct of War in
Answering Complaints.
l/tXDOX, May 31.?The vote for ?ho
salary of I'trl Kitchener ;i = Secretary
for War in the House of Commons to
day led to a discussion of tho general
? conduct of the war. In introducing tho
vote. Harold ,T. Tennant. parliamentary
t'nder-Secretary for War. replied to tho
specch made last week by Winston
?Spencer Churchill, in which he said tho
position of the British linen at several
points was disadvantageous. anil Miat
, there were large mnnherp of men on
j duty as prooms and officers' servants
who might he user! to augment the
ftghting forces.
Mr. Tennant pointed out that a larpo
number of men wore required behind
the lines to move up necessary sup
plies. The War Office, he. said, already
had adopted the plan of replacing
; younger soldiers with older ones.
| although this could not he. donn in
every cn.se.
j As to Colonel Churchill's complaint
j in recard tc> the larpe number of
officers' servants. Mr. Tennant said
these men. like nil others, had to take
their places Ir. the firing ltn?v With
regard to '*? criticism respecting the
great force of men kept at home, he
explained, they were being trained with
: a view to being sent abroad.
Mr. Tennant then referred to Colo
nel Churchill's recommendation that
j large bodies of troops be drawn from
Asia and Africa, saying It was an lllus
| ion to think such a thing possible. In
the. first place, there was not a large
j number of men in those regions suitable
j for service a? soldiers In the ICuropean
war. and even If there were, it would
! be impossible to procure officers who
j know the languages and were, able to
| command them. Moreover. the value
; of black troops was a very uncertain
quantity, and If Colonel Churchill
would look at the German papers, he
would see how pleased the Germans
were at the idea of seeing these troops
employed by the allies.
OFKICKHS COl l,II 1.10A ICY
i.AX?a\\f;rcs iiv that timb
In reply. Colonel Churchill said that
when he made his speech he had con
templated having thesr- armies ready
by September of 1917. He. believed
officers could learn the languages by
that time.
Colonel Churchill referred to the
statement in Ktnc George's message
to the nation, issued on signing the
military service bill last week, that no
less than 5,041,00(1 men had been raised
voluntarily. After careful examination,
j Colonel Churchill said, ho had come to
the conclusion that there, were 1,700,001
uf these, tnen unaccounted for. Ho
, desires to know what had become of
them, and suggested a committee be
appointed to look into this matter.
Colonel Churchill criticized the army
administration In several respects, but
| defended Karl Kitchener warmly. He
complained that the supply of rifles
was inadequate, with the result that the
British were holding and lighting a
l smaller number of opposing troops than
1 the resources of this nation would
j lustlfy.
j Broadly speaking, ho asserted, half
; tho total strength of the Hritlsh army
? was at homo, and for every six men
. taken for war service only one effective
I infantry vlfle was planed over tho
| parapet at the front.
j Colonel Churchill further complained
;that while the fighting men were com
j psiratively small in numiicr. and sol -
j dlers worn with sortleewere heavily
I burdened and .sever<-ljL tricil l>y beinp
| soot back to the fron/ month after
j month, multitudes of fresh men were
j kept at home and prevented either by
I bad management or defective organi
zation. from being usefully employed
either In industry or in the field. As
an instance, he said, his own battalion
had received a draft of thirty-five men
out of whom twenty-six had been pre
viously wNunded, and this at a time
when they could see that there prob
' ably were more than V,000,000 men at
i home and elsewhere who had not heard
? the whistle of a bullet.

OXI.Y OIPOUTAM POINT
i Reginald McKenna. Chancellor of the
j Kxclioquer. in a general reply to Col
? one| Churchill's criticisms, said that
i the only important point raised was re
j eardimr the number i?f men kept for
i home defense, lie had consulted i lit
! Adjutant-General on the subject. h?
, added, and believed he. was right in
saying that it was the same number
as was agreed upon between the ad
miralty and the War Office, when Mr.
Churchill himself was at. the head of
the Admiralty.
Premier Asquith in replying to Colo
nel Churchill's criticisms argued that
the possibility of an invasion must be
taken into consideration, (hough per
sonally he thought an invasion unlike
ly. Mr. Asquith said: "li is !t (j.sic
which cannot he left out of account,
and we must always effectively pro

Maintaining thnt the pi
friendship by the United Statoi
expressed desire for nonlnt
has been contradicted by th
the Washington government,;
favs the time has arrived wh
ington must declarc Itself ci
unequivocally as to its future
ttons toward Mexico.
After reciting the facts which led
to the first crossing- of the frontier by
the American troops after the Villa
raid at. Columbus, the note insistn that
in contradiction of the word of Gen
erals Scott and Funston, another ex?
peditlon crossed the boundary line, thus ^
violating' all the precepts of interna?^
tional laws, aiul creating an act of ^1
invasion.
"The American government," saya ?<
the note, "has admitted that the work'?
of the expedition which entered after *
the Columbus raid, le now overt"*"6ut,
in spite of this fact, American troops
still remain on Mexican soil. To con
tend that political disorder in this ?
country justifies this act of the Amer
ican military forces is In conflict with
the repeated professions of the Wash
ington government relative to nonin
terference.
Tht? note points out that much of the
trouble in Mexico is due "to the atti
tude of the United States in not pun- !
tailing conspirators In the United States^
who have plotted the downfall of the .
present Constitutionalist government; "i
and to the nets of Washington in
