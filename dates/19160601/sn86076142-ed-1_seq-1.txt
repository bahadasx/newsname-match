WRITES BERLIN MAN
Professor Declares President
Wilson Leans to Allies in
All Suggestions
(By Associated Press.) '
BERLIN, June 1 . Professor Hans Delburck of the University of
Berlin in un article regarding American mediations, says there is
something repellant to Germany in the idea of accepting President
Wilson's mediation. It is obvious, he says, that the sympathies of
Wilson are with the entente powers, which might'be regarded as dis
qualifying him so far as the central powers are concerned. He says,
"The president, by using in his speeches, expressions which are in
sulting, created an atmosphere between us, which renders a cordial
r'approchement no longer possible."
