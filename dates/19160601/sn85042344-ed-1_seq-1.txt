ST. LOfllS, May 31 Colonel The
odore Roosevelt made three
speeches in St. Louis today In which
he advocated universal military serv
ice, declared the Herman-American
alliance was guilty of moral treason
and antl-Amcricanlsm and denounced
President Wilson's Memorial day
speech as weak. Tremendous cheer
ing and crowds prided him.
Colonel Roosevelt Maintained that
President Wilson tiscd "weasel"
words which sucked the life out if
his phrases and mado them meanlng
lcss. "When Mr. WlUm speaks of 'unl
Versiil voluntary training,' " ho as
serted, "he draws a parallel to a tru
ancy law which would make univer
sal attendance by children at school
obligatory to all ox-ept those who
wanted to keep awiy.
Mr. Koosevelt averred that he
thought well of Mr. liryan and Mr.
Ford.
"I like them In private life." he
added. "They are rice, amialile men.
Hut I cannot Join them in any wild
mental Joy rides whiih is what I
should he compelled to do If I should
take their Ideas seriously.
In his address it the Mercantile
cluh, "olonel Knnsrvi It emphasized
the ni ea or co-opcrinion neiwecn
business nun, labor and the govern
inent.
Must Be Pre parcel.
"I bclhve most emphatically that
our end must be preparedness in
matters social and Industrial, enmmn
Inir efficienev and 't'stlee. An Indis
pensnhle means to this preparedness
in military preparedness, that we may
be able to settle our problems Mr our
selves an.l rot have them settled by
someone else with n gun.
"It is absolutely certain that ag
gression will be 'mited by the na
tion that is opulent. aggressive and
unprepared. We hr.ve In this cMintry
free speech. Hut the luxury of a
ready tonirue cannot permanently he
enjoyed wltn safety by the man wltn
on unready hand.
Whi-n the colonel left the Merean
tile cluh for the e'lty club a great
crowd greeted him. The street was
packed and the windows of buildings
a block away were crowded. A cheer
arose as he entered his automobile
and the crowd called for a peecn.
Noevlcrt a Hall.
Colonel Itoosevelt stood on the seav
of the automobile and said:
'"I am sorry that circumstances
were such that f could not address
the people of St. Louis in a lam
hall, but T am here just between
trains and little time was Riven to
make arrangements: but I have .lust
one thlni to say: T am here to talk
straight I'nlted States.."
Roosevelt took Issue with President
Wilson's views on preparedness and
declared he was unalterably opposed
to hyphenated alliance, be they German-A
rnerlcan or F.ngllsh-Amerlcan.
"The trouble with us in America," Mr.
Itoosevelt said, 'is our tendency to
ttse lofty words to veil our meaning.
Kvcry One Prepare.
"Mr. Wilson said the acid test was
ahnut to be npplied to the business
men of the nation to see if they will
allow their employes to volunteer foi
training. I am against tha;. It can
not be patriotism that ask3 one irnn
to have others prepare to do his fight
lng. I appeal for you to preparw
yourself. lion t wait for the other
fellow. Oet out of the rut of the
copperhead pacif.jt."
"I wish." he continued, "to correct
the misstatement that this prepared
ness movement is backed by the mu
nitions manufacturers. That Is false.
I challenge any human being to provw
that there is any connection. The men
most concerned are patriots, not
; monev peckers.
"When I say I am against hyphe
nated Americanism, I mean Just
w hat I say. I should be just as un
alterably opposed to an Engllsn
Amerlcan alliance as I am against
the Cicrmnn-Amerlean alliance. What
ever defense I may have for my atti
tude, you can't accuse me of pussy
footing America Always.
"There Is no place here for the
person who want to make a polyglot
boarding house out of our nation. Just
as Washington, Lee and Greene wero
against every foe, so we must be.
"When I say universal service, that
Is what I refer to. I do not expect
to suck the life out of my words,
do I want anv one to consider
ffat I shall Join the pacifists in any
wild mental Joy rides.
"t'nele Sam has Just on? friend
Uncle Bam."
Colonel Roosevelt addressed Vna
largest crowd at the City club In the
afternoon, where he said that neu
trality that allowed trampling on
American rights could not be toler
ated und that there could be no
Americans who were not Americans
to the heart.
"I denounce the German-Amelcan
alliance with all my soul," he shouted.
"The acts if Its leaders constitute
moral treason to our government and
cur people "

Was ririhloheiii Fair.
Debate on the arrior plate amend

as a separate bill in the senate, cen
tered largely around the question
whether thei ltct hlchcm Me-ol com
pany, the largest private manufac
turer of plate, had treated tho govern
ment fairly in dealings with it.
Reptesentatlves Butler Him Graham
of Pennsylvania, waged the fight
against the naval committee amend

amendment by Mr. Butler looliiiii? to
a settlement of the cmiti o ersy be

The increase of 2,710 sailors In the
navy personnel would be effected by
removing the hospital corps from the
total number of enlisted men pro
vided by law. Representative Rob

iittempt to add 2.750 sailors and 700
marines to the bill. Mr. Padgett said
the country would have no use for
this additional number of mailnes at
this time.
I'nder the construction bonus
amendment the secretary of the nav
would be authorized to award bonuses
of as mm h us 20 per cent of contract
prices for quick delivery. It .Would
require the employment of extr.t

Tho note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after the
Holiiiiihus Incident without the per
mission of the Mexican government.
The act was not considered one of
Invasion then solely because tho
Foiled State's said they had misinter
preted the attitude if the Mexican
government. When the second ex
pedition crossed tho line after tho
Hleiin Springs Incident, the note main
tains the plea than this was done with
the consent of the Mexican consul ui
Del Rio, Texas, Is untenable and that
act ,'n only be considered one of In.

"The Mexican government there
fore Invites the I'nited States to bring
to nn end this unsupportable situa
tion," the note concludes, "and to sup
port Its protestations and declarations
of friendship bv an immediate with
drawal of American Iroops."
