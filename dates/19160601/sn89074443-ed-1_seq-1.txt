Will YOU Do YOUR Part?
North Dakota farmers are right now in the midst of the greatest battle of their lives—with
the welfare of the whole people of the state at stake.
If the farmers and their friends lose, North Dakota will continue to be ruled by the Grain
,Trusts, Insurance Companies, Usurious Bankers, and all the hosts of Big Business. And North
Dakota people will be forced, as in the past, to pour tens of millions of dollars into the coffers of
eastern business concerns already rolling in riches.
We will have to pay these millions year after year—if we lose—because Big Business will
.make and enforce the laws. These corporation laws will not permit our people to do the things
•/^necessary.to keep their earnings at home.
North Dakota will be drained to the limit of her ability to pay. Homesteads will be mort
gaged and lost. As in the past, .horses, machinery and household goods will be sold under the
hammer and the tillers of the soil will be turned out of their homes. Merchants will go broke
because the farmers can not pay their store bills. Heavy mortgages, high interest, low prices,
will force long hours of toil. Wives, mothers and sisters will work in the field. Children will
ri
school summers to plow, seed and harvest, and kept at home winters for lack of
money to pay the way thrbugh'high school or collesge. All will be debt &nd. drudge^^^^
v" athers will die from overwork and worry while yet they should be young.
^Mean while we ^vill yield up tens of millions of "the earnings of our wives anddaughters and
pothers and fathers and brothers to the greedy masters of trade and finance in the East—mil
lions that they do not need and can not use—millions that should be spent in North Dakota to
make happy and prosperous a great people in a great state—millions that should be spent by
North Dakota farmers with North Dakota business men to the greater advantage of both. ,.,
All this—as in the past—IF WE LOSE.
But we are not going to lose.
WE MUST NOT! WE WILL NOT! 'Why should we? Farmers produce the wealth—
feed all the people. Directly or indirectly they pay all the taxes. THEY ARE THE FOUN
DATION, THE PROTECTORS, THE GUARDIANS, THE PROVIDERS OF THE STATE.
Who but the enemies of justice would say that if the farmers control they would ruin the
state they builded and Have and must provide for and feed? Would they destroy their own
:-homes? Would a mother starve her babe or a father wilfully wreck his own. son? Neither
would the farmers and progressive business men of the cities and villages wreck the state, but
rather would they make it the greatest state in the Union,
LOSE? NO We should WIN because we have right and justice on our side. We WILL
S win. We will win because we have on our side the numbers to back up right and justice.
At primaries we are forty thousand strong. Forty thousand signed and paid members.
^This is not all. Of farm helpers and hired men, fathers and sons and brothers arid friends of
^"members there are at least fifteen thousand more votes for the farmers' ticket/ Then there are
?|a host of progressive laboring men and friends of farmers in the cities and villages who will
vote with the farmers* In all fifty or sixty thousand votes for the people's ticket..
So we have justice and right on our side, and the numbers to make justice and right the vic-
l^lf every member does his part it is impossible to lose. mmm
Ninety-five out of every one hundred members are at work to win. From every voting pre
cinct come messages of cheer and sure evidence of victory." *'4'~ SllffiliSifSffi St
