LIEU. MARONEY
r GIVES DARE
DEVIL FLIGHT
In Logan Yesterday He Demonstrated
Hit Ability to Successfully
Manage Flying Machine
Lieut. Terah T. Maronoy, nrst of
ficer In flying corps of the Washing
ton Stato Mllltin, camo to Logan ac
cording to - previous announcement
and yesterday demonstrated to the
Cacho Valley iieoplo that he has no
fear of high altitude nnd there Is
no doubt In the mind of any of the
many thousands who Baw his spec
tacular night, but this dare devil
aviator Is ablo to scalo tlie highest
peaks with Ills Curtis biplane.
Promptly at 2:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon Aviator Maronoy climbed
into his aeroplane with apparently
no more concern than a chauffeur has
when ho climbs Into his automobile
and started oft Into the nlr in a bird
like fashion. After circling over the
crowd n time or two, ho gavo an ex
hibition in altltudo flying and while
tliero Is nothing definite as to how
high ho went, it Is the opinion of
most of thoso who were at tbo start
ing grounds that ho must have been
at least 4000 feet In tlio air. When
he started down II, looked as It ho
dropped headlong for several Hun
dred feet at a time. Ho circled over
the crowd several times beforo slight
ing and at ono tlmo shot down Into
the crowd in such a way that lie was
but a few feet over tho heads ot the
spectators and then ho would sail
off again in a manner that was al
most Inconceivable.
Lieut. Maronoy Is a graduato ot
tho Curtis Aviation School and has
been in tho flying gamo since 1003.
Ho is a licensed aviator and n mem
ber of tho Aero Club ot Amcrlcn.
THo also holds a certificate from the
Montana Stato Legislature which
shows he is official aviator ot Mon
tana. Tho machine In which ho gave his
flight yesterday was equipped with n
100 horso power Curtis engine, and
when It was turned on at full speed
it traveled about CO miles l'er hour.
Llout. Maronoy has achieved an
envlablo reputation in aeronautical
circles during the last four years.
Ho Is at tho present tlmo consider
ing a proposition from tho Logan
Commercial Club nnd tho officers of
tho County Fair Association to re
turn to Logan again in September
and glvo a flight during fair week
In this city.

'
EVILS OF WORRY.
Most worries are by antlelpa
tlon. It Is a sin because It
means a waste of life. It Is Just
as controllable as the drink and
drug habit. It has the same ef
fect on life and character that
dissipation has. It Is no more
sinful to drink yourself Into the
Butter than to worry yourself
Into the grave. You won't be
asked how you wasted your
life, but why you wasted your
life. BUhop Woodcock.
