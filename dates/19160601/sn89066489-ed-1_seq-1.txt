DECORATION DAY.
Bates County Medical
The regular meeting of the
Bates County Medical Association
. was held in this city Thursday af
ternoon of last week.
The out of town physicians
present were:" Dr. C J. Allen,
president of the Association, Rich
Hill; Dr. & Robinson and Dr.
Floyd Bates of Adrian. The sub
ject discussed was "The Latest
Methods of Treating
Services in Memory of Their Dead
Comrades Held by G. A. R.
Post.
Fitting services were held
Tuesday by the Grand Army post
and the camp of- Ex-Confederate
veterans in honor of those who
have passed away.
It was an ideal day cool and
pleasant and the roads leading to
Butler were in good condition.
. About 10 o'clock the parade
formed on the east side of the
square under the direction of
Thos. Wainwright, Grand Mar
shal. First came the Butler band
followed by a company of chil
dren who were to help decorate
the graves. Then came the fire
department, followed by a firing
squad from Co. B, National Guard
of Missouri and the members of
the G. A. R. and Ex-Confederate
posts and citizens in carriages
and autos.
At the cemetery the band
played "The Star Spangled Ban
ner." Rev. Geo. R. Scroggs of
the Presbyterian church delivered
an invocation. H. O. Maxey de
livered an impressive address on
"The Spirit of Memorial Day."
A salute was fired by the firing
squad of Co. B.
Before inarching to the ceme
tcrv the members of the G. A. R.
Post assembled on the east steps
of the court house where their
pictures were taken.
One could but notice how, the
ranks of the old veterans are be
ing thinned by the grim reaper.
Only a few years ago on Decora
tion Day there would be long
lines of blue and gray elad vet
erans who marched briskly to the
music of the drum and fife, hut
this year there was but a mere
handful of the old boys left and
many of them were unequal to the
task of marching to the cemetery.

- Hadley to Nominate Hughes
New York, May 30. It had
been expected that Gov. Whit
man would make the Hughes
nominating speech in the Chicago
convention but it was learned to
day that that honor has been of
fered to former Gov. Herbert S.
Hadley of Missouri.
The selection of Hadley to nom
inate Hughes was talked over
when Gov. Whitman and Frank
H. Hitchcock, former Postmaster
General, conferred in this city
some days ago. Gov. Whitman
experts to be one of those who
will seeond the nomination of
Justice Hughes.
The Hughes boomers also have
Hadley in mind for the vice pres
idential nomination. An alterna
tive nomination they are discuss
ing is that of Gov. Hiram W.
Johnson. The ticket, "Hughes
and Johnson," ought to hold the
Progressives, some of the. Hughes
men contend. On the other hand,
Hadley '$ calmness, sanity and
persisient reasonableness ' ' his
sweet reasonableness" somebody
characterized his manner in the
1912 convention when the mildest
term applied to an opposing fao
tionalist was "porch-climber or
burglar" are set forth as having
impressed his personality upon
the "delegates-amlnipnrthirT''OTtri
try. Thus, it is contended, his
nomination as a running mate for
Hughes would be wise and good
politics.
The Hughes boomers are by far
the most confident of all the
backers of presidential candida
cies. They claim they have with
in 60 votes of a majority which is
493 votes. The Hughes men claim
435.
