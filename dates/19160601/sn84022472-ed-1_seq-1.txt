s
Funston Gets Information
on Disposition of De Facto
Government Forces in Or
der That Expeditionary
Troops of U. S. Will Be
Protected. ' ,
Washington; June 1 It was
i stated authoritatively , today
that American troops will not
be withdrawn from Mexico un
til the Carranza authorities
demonstrate control of the sit
juati on sufficient to protect the
(American .border.
A reply to, that effect prob
i ably will be made to' Carranza's
.presidential note. - The United
I States was represented today as
.ready; to withdraw the droops
i wherf possible but ""determined
jto wait until , the Carranza
I forces can control the situation.
Steps 1 were taken by the war de
partment today to obtain more defi
nite information to the disposition of
the Carranza. troops iriChihuahua. It
was said that the tone of Carranza'a
I note prompted- the action of military
i officials without regard to the diplo
' ma tic phases of the situation.
General' Funston has been asked to
, outline clearly the situation in Chi
! hua,hua according "to his most recent
i information . :of the. ,, wheEefcbots4;-- of -i
Carranjt'"deta.ehments. No anxiety is
jfelt for- the safety of General Persh
j ings columns but in view of the state
j menta in Carranza' s note it is desired
I to know as accurately as possible
' what the movements of his force are.
It' was explained at the war depart
ment that the real mission of the ex
pedition at this 'time was to prevent
attacks upon the wide section of the
border: controlled bjr its position in
Mexico. , As a question of military
strategy it is' considered that only a
-'j force disposed as are General Persh
' lug's troops could accomplish that.
A large border garrison or patrol,
it was pointed out, might repel an at
tack but could not make it impossible.
With General Pershing's forces ready
to break vup any atttempt by bandits to
assemble a force for a surprise at
itack on an. American border-, town i
officials feel that renewal of raiding
1 within the zone controlled by'' his
! forces' is virtually impossible.
Cavalry patrols are active through
jthe territory on both sides of General
'-Pershing's base and the line of com-
imunication and war department in
this region, and along the border, de
spite the alle-ns of the Carranza
note that the expedition is "interned
in Chihuahua state," lying idle with no
military object, its position . constitut
ing a continued menace to the peace
of the two counthies.
No additional troop movements
' were in contemplation today so far as
known.
There was no indication at .the. state
department that the oevelopments had
produced an. urgent situation. A re
liply maynot be made for a week or
ten days. iVarious inaccurate state
ments it awakes will be pointed out.
i References to the effect of American
i domestic politics upon the border sit
uation, the suggestion that all Latin
America is waiting to. see what the
"United States will do- to maintain its
protestationyof friendship and the ref
erence to American trade in war mu
nitions with Europe probably will be
wholly ignored although it is under
stood they would have brought a sharp
" rebuke if any less perplexed and dis
ordered government had taken such a
' course.
. The reply probably will point out
-that Major Langhorne's detachment
penetrated nearly 200 miles into Mex-
, ico in pursuit of the Boquillas raiders
without ' encountering one Carranza
rolUier or official and that while such
a. situation prevails no steps toward
withdrawal will be taken.
The Mexican' embassy has , distri
buted copies of the note to some of
, -the other embassies and legations.
Suggestions of European influence be
hind the latest move by Carranza
" were renewed.

tween New Haven and Westerly, R. I.,
and New London and West Thompson
was. at a standstill today as a result
of the strike at midnight of the mo
tormen, conductors, powerhouse and
carbarn employes on the lines. The

night and the new scale asked for by
the men provided for a maximum of
35 cents ' an hour after three years
service. The company offered a com
promise of a 32 cent "maximum and
the situation has deadlocked. .

company today posted a notice inform
ing the strikers that unless they re
turned to work7 within twenty-four
hours they could consider themselves
no longer In the company's employ
and new men will be brought 'in to
take their places. It was also an
nounced that sufficient men had been
secured to take the places of the strik
ing powerhouse men and that the plant
was in operation.

tor of boilers. . s
When O'Brien went to the girl's fa
ther he said the shooting took place
In a vacant lot near her home, accord
ing to Walter. To the police later he
is said to have claimed that a revolver
fell from the girl's hand and that she
was accidentally shot. A subsequent
story attributed to O'Brien by the po
lice was that the young woman had
shot herself after saying several
times, "It would be nice for us to die
together," and that he then attempted
suicide. O'Brien was said to have ex
plained that the bullet struck a belt

morning along the . trolley line on ac
count of the strike whieh went into
effect today on the Shore Line Elec
tric Railway. The New Haven rail
road sent out a special from the Junc
tion at 7:30 a. m. and will make the
trips backhand forth from New Ha
ven while the strike is on. Service
stopped last night tout two cars were
running between Chester and Guil
ford. When they delivered their pass
engers they were called in.
Trouble with the turbines Is said
to be the cause of their not starting
out this morning on the line as there
are 30 men at the car barns and 10
were brought to the Guilford barns
at 5 a. m. in automobiles from here.
Thirty men are expected before noon
to fill the jobs. The employes in the
powerhouse or. car barns are not -connected
with the .strikers so their work
is not disturbed. A car is 'making
the trips between the car barns and
powerhouse all morning.' Superin

presents to Mrs. Beardsley when her
silver wedding was observed. '
There, were no signs of disturbance
of any kind at 10:30 o'clock lat
evening when Samuel F. Beardsley,
the son, retired for the night, it is
believed that' the work was done by
someone not well- versed in burglary
as the "ob" presented many evidences
that it was not the work of the pro
fessional. "-
Exit was made through a door
opening from the dining room on the
porch. The porch,' which extends
About half way around the side of the
house was only a few feet distant
from the window entered and could
have been reached by a person lean
ing over the railing of the veranda., j
A watchman patrols the vicinity for
the- persons who have homes there
but he is not employed by the Beards
leys. At one time the Beardsley
home was guarded by the watchman,
but as a number of burglaries oc
curred to other houses while he was
making his rourtds, the Beardsleys de
cided not to employ him any longer.
The Beardsley residence is situated
on the northeast corner of Park place
and Myrtle avenue, directly opposite
the home of Mrs. I. DeVer Warner. It
is one of the handsomest residences
in the city and its owner, 1 Judge
Beardsley, is reputed one . of the
wealthiest men in Bridgeport. He is
a member of the firm of Beardsley &
Bea'rdsley, lawyers, being in partner
ship with his son.
Search has been made of the pawn
shops to see if 'any of the stolen ar
ticles were disposed of -and the pawn
brokers have been- warned to refuse
to accept any goods marked : as de
scribed. As most of the articles were
of small size, it is believed that the
intruder . carried them away in his
pockets. , .

A rebuke for Mayor Wilson, who

mer, was seen today in the action of
the criminal common pleas court
whieh ordered nolles in the cases of
labor leaders George ' J. Bowen, and
former Alderman Frederick Ceder
holm, Attorney Hugh J. Lavery of the
firm of Lavery & Finklestone, counsel
for the accused, said today, "Yes, it
is true that the cases have been nolled.
Prosecutor Huxford told me that af
ter investigating the matter i he would
have to recommend a nolle. He said
he did not think he would, have been
able to secure- a'conviction before a

Bowen, Cederholm and Louis J. Nel
son wjtre arrested when they insisted
they had the right to address em
ployes of the Locomobile Co. They
hired a private lot on which they
planned to hold a meeting.
Mayor Wilson ordered Supt. Birm
ingham to arrest the speakers and the
superintendent did so against his bet
ter judgment. Members of labor un
ions and in fact men in all walks of
life were indignant at the mayor's ac
tion, which they regarded as arrogant
as well as arbitrary. - .
In the city court the men were each
fined $1 and costs and judgment was
suspended. Bowen and Cederholm
were not satisfied With this, however.
They did not want to beregarded as
having been convicted, of a crime so
they insisted upon a vindication in the
common pleas court. Their counsel
thereupon filed an appeal.
Nelson left, the city after . the city'

Conductor Finds Victim of
Railroad Death N Instan
taneous, Finds Garlick.
Mangled beneath the wheels of a
passing freight train, the body of an
unknown man was found shortly be
fore midnight last night on the rail
road tracks at the foot of Bank street.
Medical Examiner S. M. Garlick held
his autopsy today and said that death
was instantaneous. . ,
It was believed that the man fell
from a freight train, but two tickets
found in his pocket tend to disprove
this. One of the tickets was pur
chased in Hartford and was from
Hartford to New York, while the oth
er purchased in this city was from
Bridgeport to New Haven. Both
were stamped June 1, indicating that
they had been purchased yester
day. ' . '
i The man, evidently about 35 years
of age and six feet tall, wore a pair of
blue overalls and jumper and it was at
first believed that he was a railroad
man. He wore only one sock,, that
on his right foot and he also wore
two undershirts.
In one of his pockets was found
$2.01 but aside f-om the tatooed in
itials "R. S.," on the right forearm
there were no marks of identifica
tion. The body was discovered by Con
ductor Carlt of a passing freight
train and he signalled the engineer
to stop. The body was on track No.
2, an east bound freight track. Yard
master Lou Bristol was notified and
after it was ascertained that the man
was dead, the body was removed to
Cullinan & Mullin's morgue, where it
awaits a claimant.

and Director of Public
Works Behind Closed;
Doors For Last Step in
Half Million Dollar Pav
ing Scheme.
Forty Miles of Pavement
v Ordered From Makers of1
Warrenite, Biggest Single
Contract Ever Made ini
History, of the City of!
Bridgeport.
Behind closed doors in hi3j
private office today Jacob A.;
Gourtade, director of public1
works, with attorneys for the
Warren Bros, of Boston signed
the largest paving contract
ever made in this city.
It was, not only the largest
paving contract ever let in this
city but it was the largest con
tract ever made here for public
works and it was let without!
competition, other "contractors
who might want to bid were!
barred.
The contract calls for the lay-.
ing of Warrenite on about 40 1
miles of streets and will prac
tically take all of the $500,000
bond issue which the peopln
voted for new paving at the
last election. .
' Mayor Wilson last night signed th
waiver which permitted Mr. Courtade
to sign contracts to spend nearly half
a million dollars of the taxpayers'
money without getting a price in the
market by competitive bidding. The
mayor would not say whether the di
rector or the members of the streets
and sidewalks committee of the com
mon council had requested the waiver
or whether he acted on his own ini
tiative in signing, it. He was out of
the city today.
Mr. Courtade kept out of the way
of the newspapermen and all visitors
to his office until after he had finished
business with the Warren Bros. Co.'s.
attorneys. Then he left the city hall
for his home.
The cost of the pavement is written
down in the contracts as $1.20 per
square yard for the paving, $5 per
cubic yard for trap rock filling and
grading and the cost price for scari- j
fying plus 5 per cent. The work is to. '
commence as soon as the company
can get men and materials here.
The Warren Bros.' superintendent
here plans to have delivery depots, i
one in the West End and one in the j
East End. where the materials' will i
be brought. There will be three mix- 1
ing depots, one in the North End, one '
in the West End and one in the East j
End, and possibly one lh the South I
End. A large number of Portugese ,
negro laborers will be imported from :
Massachusetts.
Agents of the company are nq.w
considering renting ground on which
to erect barracks for , these laborers
on the outskirts of the city. The
agents of the company have it diffi
cult to get the necessary labor here
or to house the laborers they will
bring here so they are considering th4
plan for establishing camps for them. I

council has voted to have paved fol- i
