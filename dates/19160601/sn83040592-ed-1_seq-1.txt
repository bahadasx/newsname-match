School Closes.
The school term closed on last
Friday with a class day program
in the afternoon and the gradua
ting exercises at night Numbers
were rendered as given on the
program last week.
The commencement address
given by Dr. G. W. Trout on
"Environment, and Its Effects on
the Physical, Intellectual and
Moral," was commented on favor
ably by many. Dr. Trout pre
sented an excellent address in a
very forceful manner. A voice
solo by Miss Irene Roberts, the
vocal duet by the Misses Rowe of
Columbus, the voice solo by Pris-
cilia Wear, a piano duet by Edna
Dills and Lela Simmons and a
song by the Junior class and sel
ections by the Covey Orchestra
added greatly to the interest of
the program.
Large audiences were present
at both programs.
Mr. and Mrs. M. D. Hileman
left yesterday for a trip to Color
ado and Utah to visit relatives.
They will also visit in Texas.
With ore being found right in
town, the excitement is growing.
And as we go to press the strike
is bigger and getting bigger.
The Kansas City papers were
late arriving at Baxter yesterday
morning. Teddy spoke in Kan
sas City the day before that is
the reason the Standpatters give
for the slowness of the papers.
Very little complaint is heard
about the booze haulers any more.
They are polite to the extreme,
and never hog the road any more.
Not all of them travel through
this city, either. Many of them
take a road which leads through
the country just south of Colum
bus. The tractor plowing demon
stration out on Frank Hartley's
farm last Friday drew quite a
crowd. The big tractor pulled a
couple of big plows very easily.
and plowed about ten inches
deep, too. Several of our far
mers will be uaing tractors this
fall to do their plowiag. Deep
plowing is going to make the
soil more productive.

The recent heavy rains have
put farm work back some, but the
ground has been well soaked, and
wheat and oats have been bene
fited. The ore prices have been going
down recently, but it is thought
the decline is only temporary.
At any rate there is no let up in
activity.

COUNTY. KANSAS. JUNE
Will Ask a Raise.
The Baxter Telephone Com
pany has asked the Public Utili
ties Commission for permission
to raise its rates. The commis
sion has given notice that a bear
ing will be given the applicant
company on June 14th.
For a long time it has been ap
parent that the company could
not continue to give service in
Baxter Springs unless it got more
pay for its money. The business
of the company is now being car
ried on as economically as possi
ble, yet the company does not
make a cent, and its books and
records will be submitted to the
utilities commission to prove this.
No telephone company can fur
nish service at the prices charged
by the Baxter Telephone Com
pany and keep in the business for
a very long time. The rates were
too low to start with, and are very
much lower than similar service
is furnished for in other towns
under anywhere near similar con
ditions.!
Baxter Springs is scattered
over a large territory, and the
cost of maintenance i. very heavy.
Then, too, everything costs a
whole lot more than it ever did
before. Phones which used to be
bought for twelve dollars now
cost eighteen dollars and wire is
higher. All kinds of supplies
have almost doubled in price.
Everything which the people use
costs more money. All fair mind
ed people know this, and they
also know, if they will stop and
think about it, that service costs
more than it used to.
We trust the company will get
a fair hearing and that permis
sion will be granted to make the
raise. We do not Jcnow what
amount of raise will be asked
for in fact we do not know that
any specific amount will be
asked just permission to make
a raise sufficient to make ends
meet. .
Try to Wreck Train.
Erisco train 112, due here at
2:32 a. m., was very nearly
wrecked just this side of Miami
yesterday morning. The train
was running on time, when it
struck a crow bar, which had been
placed in such a position that it
derailed the train. No one was
hurt, and the train did not arrive
here until about 9 o'clock, coming
in from Miami over the M. O. &
G. rails.
Right In Town.
Clarence Denton and Wheeler
Denton are sinking a shaft in the
southeast part of town, and at
seventeen feet came onto quite a
body of lead. Several parties
have tried to become interested in
the strike, but nothing is doing.
The boys say they will work it
themselves.
The strike is just south of the
Demp Lawrence home.
Struck by Lightning.
The bouse occupied by J. O.
Treece was struck twice by light
ning last Monday morning. The

How To Succeed
When you seek advice you don't consult the failures,
do you? You ask people who have succeeded.
All right We take it for granted that you want to
succeed in life too; want to make money and have some
of the comforts and even luxuries. Need advice? Co ask
the men of this community how they did it. Watch their
methods if you don't feel free to ask. You will find that
they all have funds at the bank. Most of them started in
a small way. They were industrious, they practiced econ
omy and they met their obligations with scrupulous care.
Some of them are directors of this bank today. The same
road is open for you.
