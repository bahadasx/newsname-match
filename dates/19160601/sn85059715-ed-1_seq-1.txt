which ended in a costly check tor

opinion of French military critic
the result was not only a costly f
tire for the German hut a su< cfor
the French such as tley ha really
attained.
Tho Germans suffered so heavll;that
they ceased further attacks,
while tlte French, bv .1 prompt counter
attack, re-established thoraselvos
again south of Ciimlen- and won an
important point of vantage on thoi
southwest slope of Dead Man hill.
It developed that during yesterday's
battle wes: nt the Mouse the
Germans r.ent lue*k th? French line
between Dead Man lliil and Ctinilercs
for a distune of three-quarters ,
of a mile. The French battalions.!
whieh had retired before the 11 npre-1

made a desperate counter attack.
Aft?*r nearly two hours of violent
fighting they recovered all tho lost 1
; ground. The Infantry fighting in
4 this struggle Is described as the
fiercest of the war.
The official war office statement ofj
today says:
j "During the night of May 31 a

One of the tangible evidence* of
this new era of prosperity 1h the Telegram
"lo.000 Club." Through the
distribution <?t $4,350 worth of extraordinary
prizes among those who enter
and become active members of
the club, the Telegram ha* paved the
way for each and every man and wowan
of Clarksburg and its vicinity to
secure a generous ahuro of the largo
amount of money which has been put
aside to further our effort* in the
ever-Increasing held of circulation.
If Is a profit-sharing plan withouta
peer. Prodi-sharing these days is
generally connected with coupons, or
Honry Ford. Bpt the "10,000 Club"
Is like none of these; It is refreshing-;
ly different.
Br Ailing out tho nomination blank

Issue you will become a member of
the club and entitled to participate*
In the distribution of prizes. The
prizes will be distributed accordfng!

the court, the prosecutor and his own!
attorney. !>r. Walto said he was
very sorry for the crime and for the;
ti ouble and suff??rlnr he had caused i
others. Ho declared that ho hopsd
by surrendering liis body for punishment
ho would compensate In aomo j
small degree for the death of liis j
