new subscriptions since the beginning
of the contest up to Saturday
?
evening, May 27. The race dfa
very close in both districts and a
number of our candidates missed
the prizes only by one and two sub*
scripti ns. Winning one of the
special prizes does not mean that
the winners are ahead on votes at
the present time, as some of those
who lost turned in old subscriptions
that would more than bring their
vote total up to what the prize winners
have. The candidates are very
elose together and it is anybody's
race just now. A candidate with

energy and enterprise can euipj mc
( contest at the present writing and
* with a little effort and perseverance
win a handsome prize.
SPECIAL'PRIZE FOR JUNE 19.
For the largest number of months
entered, on new and old subscriptions,
during this period of the contest,
beginning May 29 and ending
June 10, at 7 p. m., we will give a
three-piece bedroom suit valued at
$125. This beautiful suit has been
? purchased of The Kings trefe Furniture
Company and is on display at
their store.
The subscriptions will be counted
by months. A subscription for one
year will count 12 months on the bed
room suit and 9,000 votes on the
Maxwell automobile; two years will
count 24 months and 18,000 votes;
five years will count 60 months and
50,000 votes. Old subscriptions,
renewals and new subscriptions will
be counted on this prize. If you
have a friend who is behind on his
subscription and will pay you even a
part of it, it will count for you.
It is well to turn in your subscriptions
as soon as you get them so that
proper credit may be given the subscribers
on our books. It is not
necessary to have your votes all
published. Send in your subscripJ~*
J Kofnrn a vntinc
11 CUB KUU WC nui _ _
receipt that will be good antil the
cloee of the contest. We are already
hearing complaints and upon investigation
find that the subscriptions
have not been turned in.
It must be understood that subscriptions
entered previous to May
29 will not be counted on the bed
room suit. You have the votes
that go to help you to win the car
or .one of the large cash prizes at the
close of the contest, June 24, 1916.
Organize business-like methods in
conducting your campaign of votes.
This is essential in any business
transaction and the contest is notdif
ferent from any live business. It
takes a leader, an organizer, a workair,
to pull anything through that
. % amounts to anything.
^ Work hard yourself, collect cou'
f pons, solicit subscriptions, see that
your friends trade with the merchants
who are giying tickets, but
exert your best efforts as an organizer.
Don't have anything else on your
mind but the winning of the bed
j1 ^ room suit, June 10, and the Maxwell
car, June 24.

Lake City, May 31:?Several automobile
owners are trying to keep
down the cost of operating their
cars by mixing kerosene with the
gasoline. The two oils are mixed
in different proportions, some using
ofie part of kerosene to three or
four parts of gasoline, and one is
using as much as one part of kerosene
to two parts of gasoline. So
far, the results are said to be satisfactory.
However, the trials are
experiments to determine what can
