v WILSON OUTLINES
PEACE SUGGESTIONS
U. 3. IS EAGER TO TAKE PART,
BUT ASKS FOR NOTHING
MATERIAL.
ONLY FREEDOM OF THE SEAS
<5ettle Forever Contention Which Has
Been Keynote of All Diplomatic Discussions
With Germany and Great
Britain.?Want Virtual Guarantee of
Territorial Integrity and Political
Independence.
Washington.?President Wilson declared
here before the League to Enforce
Peace, that the United States
was ready to Join In any feasible association
of nations to preserve the
peace of the world against "political
ambition and selfish hostlity" and in
service of "a common order, a common
Justico, and a common neace."
He expressed the hope that the
terms of peace which end the war
would Include such an arrangement.
Absolute Freedom of the Seas.
Outlining suggestions for peace,
which the President said he hoped
the United States would make if it
had opportunity to do so, he included
provision for absolute freedom of the
fleas, a contention which has been the
keystone of all the diplomatic discussions
with Germany and Greut Britain;
and virtual guarantees of territorial
integrity and political independence.
Officials interpreted the President's
address as a preliminary feeler for
P3ace in Ruropo. He outlined the
conditions on which the United States
would move If It made a formnl mediatory
offer with the idea, it was un
derstood, of learning how bucIi suggestions
would be received abroad.
"1 am sure," said the President,
"that the people of the United States
wouid wish their government to move
along these lines:
ffc Peace Only, and Its Future Guarantees.
"First, such a settlement with regard
to their own immediate inter
ests as the belligerents may agree
upon. We have nothing material of
any kind to ask for ourselves, and
are quite aware that we are in no
sense or degree parties to the present
quarrel. Our interests is only In
peace, and Its future guarantees.
Universal Association of Nations.
"Second, an universal association
of the nations to maintain the inviolate
security of the highway of the
seas for the common and unhindered
use of all the nations of the world
and to prevent any war begun either
contrary to treaty covenants or with
out warning and full submission of
the causes to the opinion of the
world?a virtual guarantee of territorial
integrity and politcal independence."
The Fundamentals of a Lasting Peace.
The fundanietals of a lasting
peace. President Wilson said he believed
were:
"First, that every people has a
right to chose the sovereignty under
which they shall live. Like other
Nations," the President said, "we
have ourselves no doubt once and
again offended against that principle
which for a little while controlled by
selfish passion, as our franker historians
have been honorable enough to
admit; but it has become more and
more our rule of life and action.
"Second, that the small states of
the world have a right to enjoy the
same respect for their sovereignty and
for their territorial integrity that
great and powerful nations expect and
Insist upon.
"And. third, that the world has a
right to be free from every disturb
ance of its peace and that its origin
In aggression and disregard of the
rights of people and nations."
Principle of Public Right Must Take
Precedence.
"If this war has accomplished nothing
else for the benefit of the world."
he said, "it has at least disclosed a
great moral necessity and set forward
the thinking of the statesmen
of the world by a whole age. Repeated
utterances of the leading statesmen
of most of the great nations now
engAgod in war, have made it plain
that their thought has come to this,
that the principle of public right must
henceforth tako precedence over the
jp, Individual interests of particular Na
tions, and that the Nations of the
world must in some* way band themselves
together to see that right prevails
as ngninst any sore of selfish ag
gression.
Inviolable Rights of Mankind.
"That henceforth all alliance must

standing against understanding, but
ihat there must be a common agreement
for a common object, and that
at the heart of that common object
must lie the Inviolable rights of pco
pies and mankind.
United States Eager to Participate.
"So sincerely do we believe In these
things," said the President in oonclu
eion, "that I am sure that I speak the
mind and wish of the people of Amcr
tea when I say that the United Statejts
willing to become a partner in any
feasible association of Nations form
ed in order to realize these objects
and make them secure against viola

'I desire to take this opportunity of
expressing to my people my recognition
and appreciation of the splendid
patriotism and self-sacrifice they
displayed in raising by voluntary enlistment

REJECTS PEACE RUMORS
i
SIR EDWARD GREY DECLARES
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS IMPOS'r
SIBLE AT PRESENT.
r
i
War Might Have Been Prevented by
Conference, But Position of En,
tente Allies Has Changed.
r London.?Sir Edward Qrey, the
British foreign secretary, in a speech
in the House of Commons set aside
all ideas that peace negotiations were
possible at the present stage and
plainly relteratod that the position of
the Entente Allies was in no way
changed.
r Sir Edward declared that It was
. impossible to consider terms of peace
. without a previous agreement between
the Allies. Further, he expressed the
s decided opinion that the hositilities
j had not yet reached a stage where it
r was possible to talk of peace, especi1
ally as the German public was constantly
being "fed with lies" by their
} ministers.
9 Mr. Ponsonby's reference to the
a use of the American press as a "plata
form'" was the outgrowth of a recent
a interview with Sir Edward Grey. Sir
Edward in replying to this attack,
while admitting that important dis..
closures of policy ought first to be
i made to Parliament urged that a crisis
might arise during the war when con -
slderations of etiquette should not be
5 allowed to stand in the way. He coni
tended that since German statesmen
- constantly ?vere giving interviews and
1 statements to the American press it
2 would be mere pedantry which would
, hinder British statesmen from coun9
terlng these statements in the interr
ests of their own country.

UNITED STATES SENDS NOTE TO (
GREAT BRITAIN AND

RIGHTS AS NEUTRAL POWER i
Denounce* Interference With Mall* I
and Announces Only Radical
\A/ III ?-**-*
vnaiiiyc Mil! onuiTy.
Washington.?The United States,
denouncing interference with neutral I
mails, has notified Great Britain and i
France that it can no longer tolerate J
the wrongs which American citizens ]
have suffered and continue to suffer
through the "lawless practice" those 1 '
uients have indulged in, and
that only a radical change in policy, i
restoring the United States to Its tull 1
rights as a neutral power will be satisfactory.
This notification is given In tho
latest American communication to
the two governments, the text of 1
which has Just been made public by
the State Department. The time in
which the change must be effected
was not specified, but the United | <
States expects prompt action.
"Serious and vexatious" abuses
perpetrated by the British and French
governments In seizing and censoring
neutral mails are recited in the communication
and answers are made to
the legal arguments contained in the
reply of the Entente governments to
the first American note on the subject.
It is vigorously set forth that
not only have American commercial
interests been injured, but that the
rights of property have been violated
and the ruleB of lntemntinnoi io?
custom palpably disregarded. Notice
is served that the United States soon
will press claims against the British
and French governments for losses
already sustained.
The communication quotes the clos
ing paragraphs of the Joint note of
February 16 and says this government
does not admit, as asserted
therein, that parcel post matter is
subject to the exercise of the rights
of police supervision, visitation and
eventual seizure which belongs to the
belligerents as to all cargoes on the
high seas.. The three governments,
however, it is asserted, "appear to bo
in substantial agreement as to the
principle. The method of applying
the principle is the chief cause of
difference." Continuing the communication
says:
"Though giving assurances that
they consider genuine correspondence
to be inviolable and that they will,
'true to their engagements,' refrain
'on the high seas' from seizing and
confiscating such correspondence, the
Allied governments proceed to deprive
neutral governments of the hen
ofits of these assurances 1>> seizing
and confiscating mail from vessels in
port instead of at sea."
