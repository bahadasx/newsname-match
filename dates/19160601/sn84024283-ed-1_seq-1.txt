HENRY SEITZ,
Political Pointers.
One faction of Republicans is ad
vocating the nomination ot Judge
Hughes because be doesn't talk and
his views, if any he has, on the lead
ing questions of to-day, are unknown.
Another faction Is for Roosevel be
cause he talks all the time and criticises
everything that is done, and every
body who doesn't truckle to him. The
- old standpatters are ooaching Hughes
and will nse him to defeat the nomi
nation of Roosevelt. They will fur
nish Hughes with views after they
nominate him. It a sorry plight iq
which the leaders have placed the
Republican party. Many of the rank
and file of the party are growing more
and more disgusted each day and are
declaring their intention ot voting for
WilBpn. He has been tested In the
country's most trying time and has
kept the country out of the world
holocaust. ,
. The people are not eiolted about
Mexico, Germany or Great Britlan,
and they're glad tbe President Isn't.
Only those having a selfish Interest, a
political interest, or who lose their
heads over differences, are howling.
All thoughtful people approve the
course that avoids war. In their mind
nothing has occurred that justifies
war. In all the differences with the
nations the President has taken an
honorable stand and made his appeal.
It to maintain those positions war be-
comes absolutely necessary, few
serious and sensible citizens will dis
sent. :

A Shaky Principle.
(From The St. Louis Republic.)
The Anti-Saloon League is an or
ganization which has been supported
by ministers and church people gen
erally throughout the United States;
to this fact it owes its strength and its
power to affect the outcome of politi
cal battles. Its future depends on the
continuity of its bold on this con
stituency. And this continuity de-depends---In
the final test on the
fundamental principles upon which
the League bases Its action.
It is building Upon at least one
shaky principle in Missouri just - now.
Its headquarters Committee deolares
that it has addressed to a Democratic
candidate . for the nomination for
Govornor, the question whether he
will, If elected Governor, sign a pro
hibitory law with tbe "peace, health
or safety" clause attached, which
would prevent its being submitted to
the people under the referendum pro
vision of the Constitution.
Of course,, the League Is wholly
within its technical rights in address
ing any question it can frame to any
candidate whom for any reason it de
deslres to bother, harass or defeat;
that is not the aspect of the question
which concerns us; 'that is tbe ordin
ary procedure of personal politics.
The thing, we are interested in, the
thing which ought to interest every
minister, every member ot a Chris
tian church and every citizen of Mis
souri who cares a copper about the
morals of politics, is the fact that the
League Is attempting to seoure certain
legislation in a way which will dodge
the appeal to tbe people. v
The referendum provision was writ
ton into the Missouri Constitution in
order to make it Impossible for special
interests, of any sort whatsoever, to
take advantage of a temporary as
cendency in the Legislature to 'fasten
on Missouri a law not approved by
the majority ot its electorates. It is
our chief bulwark against boss rule
and machine domination.
Our referendum law was obtained
by a great struggle. It was the
struggle of the people against privi
legeof open -air government against
invisible government, of democraoy
against irresponsible despotism. Does
the Anti-Saloon League want to go
on record as championing a program
which can only be realized by a trick
which shall take away from the people
of Missouri tbe priceless right whloh
the referendum conferred upon
them the right of the soverlgn
people to pass npon the acts of its
own servants?
No moral question now before Mis
souri is more important than this.

we have never been without them In
