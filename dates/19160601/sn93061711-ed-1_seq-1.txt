INESS SECTION OF ROY
A disastrous flro visited Roy Wed
nesday of this week and nearly wiped
the business section o(T the map. It is
estimated that .'100,000 was the value
of the property Iorh.
The f're started in a Mexican shack
where it is said a cup of grease ex
ploded and set the house on fire. The
flames spread rapidly to the big store
and ware-house of Flocrsheim, lumber
yard, railroad warehouse, Hachar
aril's store, moving picture theatre,
two saloons, pool hall, two barber
shops, Spanish-American newspaper
olllce, restaurant, grain elevator con
taining several thousand bushels of
wheat, two residences and other small
buildings.
For sometime the Spanish American
has been advocating that Uoy should
be incorporated and a water and light
system installed. It has tho promise ,
of being one of the largest towns in
astern New Mexico, because of its
excellent location, but this fire will 1
put it back several years. It will re
build and within a few years no doubt
will be much better than it was be
fore the fire. The citizenship of Roy
is of the best, but economy made
them believe they were saving wore
by not incorporating and putting in
city water.
The fire started about 10:510 and
CANDIDATES ATTEND
LITERARY AT NOB
TON SCHOOL HOUSE
Saturday night about sixteen can
didates together with n number of '
their friends, went to Norton to at
tend the literary at the school house.
The crowd was late in arriving but
about 8:30 tho literary was called to
order by its acting chairman and a new
list of permanent ofilcers chosen.
A nico program was rendered by
the young folks of the neighborhood
which was highly enjoyed by those
present, especially the two recitations
given by tho little girl and hoy, whose
names the News reporter failed to
learn.
Orval Doherty, a bright young man
of that vicinity, was elected chairman;
Miss Eunice Thurston, secretary and
Robt. Jacobs, well known in Tucum
cari, as he was a member of tho lo
cal basket ball team, who lives at
Norton, was chosen as vice president.
After a nice program was rendered
Mr. Doherty, editor of the Norton
Headlight, read that interesting pa
per in a most pleasing manner. It
was well gotten up and very interest
ing, containing considerable news and
numerous jokes and catchy poetry.
A short rcccsB was taken at which
time it was decided to postpone tho
scheduled debatu in order to give the
candidates a chance to tell their trou
I les and explain their mission. Each
one was allowed ten minutes, but it
dd not take that long for some of
them to state their case.
Judge Cutlip opened and used moro
than his allotted time in explaining
why he should bo chosen as the next
district attorney. Mr. Saxon followed
and ten minutes wcro not enough for
him to explain why he should bo the
nominee for district nttornoy. Those
who heard these speeches will tell you
there was plenty of life and fire in
I oth of them. J. II. Pearson, candi
date for sheriff then spoke in his be
half and told tho people whnt ho in
tended to do if ho wore chosen to fill
that ofllcc.
Thero wore no othor candidates for
sheriff present. Leo G. Pearson, can
didate for treasurer, then spoke in
his behalf and denied tho accusation
ihnt he was not a tax-payer in Quay
county and that he would leave this
tate if he were dofeated. He said
he had been a resident of Quay county
for a long time and hoped to remain
horo whether ho wns elected or not.
Ho denied the report that ho wan buy
ing Innd in Oklnhoma and Texas, say
ing that ovory piece of real cstato ho
owned was in Quay county nnd thnt
he pays his portion of taxes. Ho then
promised tho pcoplo tho samo good
treatment in tho future thoy havo re
ceived in the past, If ho is re-elected.
Dr. Maunev and Thos. N. Lawson,
had nbout finished it work by tho time
the south-bound Polly passed through
on its wny to Tucumcari. Tho citi
zens were helpless because there was
no water in town with which to fight
the fire and the heavy wind from the
southwest nssistcd in its horrible work
of spreading from one building to an
other and for a time it is said it look
ed like the whole town was doomed.
While most of tho citizens stood help
less and looked on others were busy
doing all they could to stop tho flames
from reaching further into the resi
dence district.
This reminds ub of those who say
the United States could whip any oth
er country without preparedness. If
the citizens of Roy had been prepared
they could have saved thousands of
dollars worth of property and that
thriving little town would have gone
merrily on. Insurance companies did
not consider it good risks iti a town
without water or fire protection so
it is said the rates were exorbitant
and most of the losses were not cov
ered with insurance. This is another
renson a town should have the best
protection possible.
This dear lesson should be heeded
by other towns and arrangements
made to cope with an ordeal like Roy
has just gone through with.
then spoke in behalf of their candi
dacy for the clerk's office.
J. A. Atkins nnd J. H. Scarbrough,
tho two candidates for county school
superintendent, gave good talks along
what they believed Quay county need
ed in thnt department and promised
to devote their time in trying to bring
about those things.
Sam Dismukes then spoke in behnlf
of his candidacy for assessor. He said
he was running for a thankless job
but if elected he would do his best to
equalize the assessment so thnt the
moneyed men would pay as much as
the small property owner in propor
tion to what they own.
J. C. Williams, J. A. Abcyta and C.
E. Hunter, candidates for probate
judge, were all present and spoke In
heir behalf, promising the voters all
.vithing their power.
Wyatt Nations and Jim Lovelaily
wore the only candidates for commiss
ioner prorcnt to talk.
The meeting ended in a real old
fashioned hand-shake.
PEOPLE TO WORK ON
RAGLAND HILL FRIDAY
It has been arranged to meet at
the cap rock near Ragland Friday of
this week to work roads and widen
tho roadway up tho cap. Considerable
dynamite will bo taken out from Tu
cumcari and plenty of picks nnd shov
els. Kvery man in town, who believes
in good ronds and is able to do a little
work, is requested to be reudy early
Friday morning to make the trip and
help improve this dangerous road,
thereby making it snfo for farmers to
haul larger loads of merchandise and
provisions homo from Tucumcari nf-
tor they have marketed their wheat
and other grains at Iucumcarl.
Tucumcari has nothing to fear bo
far an competition is concerned in the
selling of goods, becauso the prices
here are lower than points on tho
hanta re. Tho only thing Tucumcari
is up against is tho fact that tho road
in hotter to Santa Fe points than up
this way, so to ovorcomo that obsta
cle tho roads must ho worked. Thoro
is no rond money in the county treas
ury and the noxt host thing is volun
teer Rorvlco. Most, nnv mnn can frn
out and work on tho roads ono day
I out of tho year and Tucumcari hun
a pretty healthy sot of fellows who
: should ho willing to do their part. Tho
' merchants donato monoy and labor
and tho othor citizens should he will

I the trip to tho cap rock. This grndo
' Is ono of tho best along tho cap and

DEMOCRATS HOLD
LARGE ENTHUSIASTIC
STATE CONVENTION
Santa Fe, May .'11. The 11(10 cam
paign has opened in a most auspicious
manner for the Democratic party of
NTew Mexico. The state convention
it Albuquerque, at which delegates to
he Democratic national convention at
St. Louis, June 11, were elected, was
lositively the largest and most en
rhuslastic gathering of its kind ever
iield in New Mexico.
When it is considered that there i;
hut one candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination; that there!
.vcre no questions at issue, and that
no party policies were to be determin-
d, the attendance must be regarded
is remarkable, and an demonstrating
n a most definite way that the Demo
cracy of the Kt'ile is entering the po
litical fight with unprecedented oarn--stness
and en(hudnm, and a spirit
f absolute harmony.
Tho keynote .ipn.li of Snntr I. C.
Jnrth was an able and exhaustive
ircsentation of the achievements of
Woodrow Wihon'rf ndmim tr.ition.and
glowing tribute to the great char
acter and statesmanship of the Dem
icratic president. The temporary
hairman likewise paid tribute to tho
character and accompli; hmcnts of
iovernor McDonald, and to the work
if A. A. Jones, first a blunt secic
ary of the interior. The great ova
,ion that, a little later, was tendered
dr. Jones, when he was picked up
)odlly and carried around the convon
lon hall on tho shoulders of two of
he delegates, all tho other delegates
'allowing and the band playing "Dix
.o," testified in a remarkable manner
o the popularity of tin- man who has
0 ably represented New Mexico ns
1 member of tho administration nt
Washington, and to the fact that tho
lemocrats of the utato are colidly bc
dnd him for tho United States sen
ile. In his speech before the conven
ion Mr. .lone.-, announced tlmt ho
vould accept the senatorial nominn
ion. In taking charge of tho dclihera
.ions of tho convention ns its pennn
jent chairman, Seen tary of Stale Mr.
ntonio Lucoro delivered n stirring
uldress in Spanish, in the course of
which he declared that "tho enthus
iasm that has reigned In thin conven
tion tho largest nnd most represent
ative In tho history of tho party and
of tho stnto is abnoluto proof to my
mind that ttie Democracy of New
Mexico, working as ono man, has tho
letcrmlnnlion not only to triumph in
tho coming election, but to place tho
stato in tho Democratic column for
all timo."
The resolutions ndopted by tho con
vention applaud the manner in which
President WIIroii has handled tho
many gravo and delicate international
I questions that have como before him,
.and condemn tho actions of tho last
' republican legislature of New Moxico
and strongly commend tho adminis
tration of Governor McDonald and
tho other Democratic state ofilcers.
At tho meeting of tho Democratic
state central committee, which pro
ceded tho convention, Santa Fo wan
selected an the place for tho stnto
nomination convention, nnd August 30

BONDS CARRY 5 T0 1
,. , , ., , . , . i
The election last I-riday resulted ,
in a vote of .171 for the bonds and 80
against, nearly five to one.
A light vote was polled because so
many of tho citizens are in favor of
any school proposition, but did not
really believe the bond issue should
have been so large. The Ronrd of
Education has no doubht figured the
proposition over Rovcral times and
thought it best to do all the work at
once nnd get through with it.
Thoy figured that Tucumcari wan
bound to grow if she had plenty of
school buildings in which to tench the
children without crowding them into
littlo cold frame buildings, scattered
about over town making it unhandy
and costly in the long-run, so thoy
put the matter up to tho voters of
Tucumcari to decide whether Tucum
cari needed $f0,000 worth of new
.school buildings and equipment. The
voters wcro given nn opportunity to
decide, nnd those who believed the
bonds were needed enme out and vot
ed while some of thoso who believed
the issue wns too large, did not vote
It has been said thnt a contest would
be instituted, but the News editor be
lieves nothing can bo gnlncd by con
testing uftcr un election has been de
cided. The board will meet next Monday
and prepare tho bonds for sale and
hen they must bo put on the market
md disposed of. Tucumcari is a val
uable town nnd it is thought no trou
ble will be had in disposing of the
bonds at a goodly sum, at least face
value with GV6 or 0 per cent. Then
the plans must be drawn and the con
tractor who makes tho lucky bid will
have to got bis forces ready to build
ihe buildings. About $18,000 will be
used in erecting another building near
the present high school, nnd nbout
324,000 used to put up tho new build
ng in tho cast part of town. The
mlnnco will he used for equipment.
When these new buildings nre com
peted Tucumcari can say to tho world
the believes in educating the young
iters nnd has done her part in pro
dding suitable buildings, for tho pres
ent, nt least.

SAMUEL M. DISMUKES
The above is a good likeness of
Swa-as he is familiarly known -who
aspires to be nominated at the Demo

"I believe in making the assessment

rty each man has at the time such
isscssmcnt is made. The small farm
r pays on every cow or any other
animal or piece of property; there
fore, I will make the large property
owner or corporation pay at the same

AT
S
Postmaster Lybrand, of Grady com--flitted
suicide last Saturday morning
iy shooting himself twice and trying
.he third time. The first shot entered
tho body on the loft side above tho
neart; tho f.cconil pierced the henvt
ind when Dr. Hale entered the store
Lybrand had the gun pointed nt his
.lend trying to shoot ngnin.
Lybrand wns unable to speak nnd
lied within a short time. Mrs. Ly
rnnd had just left the store and went
0 another across the street on nn cr
and. She said he was in his usual
nind when she left nnd the tragedy
vas a great shock to her.
The cause of tho tragedy is not ful
y known, but the report here : tates
hat Mr. Lybrand hnd once been a
leavy drinker, but had not been in
lulging i-o heav ily since holding down
he position of postmaster. He hnd
iot los thnt horrible dpsire nnd lately
md drank considerable. Mrs. Lybrand
eproved him for his wronjr doinr and
ie brooded over the matter and de
nied to separate himself from tho
i-mjitntion nnd thus used tho surer
tuthod two balls of lead.
Mr. and Mis. Lybrand were the pa
cuts of three children, one of which
1 - isted in the store. They have been
e. idents of Grady for about eight
ear. and were highly respected peo
ple. Mr. Lybrand was accommodat
ng and friendly until a day or two be
ror his death, and it is now thought
he must have been planning the tnk
ng of his own life. He left no note
if explanation nnd no one knows his
-eaton for not desiring to live, but
he was determined to put himself out
of tho way.
The family have the sympathy of
he entire community and no blnmc
s nttnehed to anyone whatever. Tho
emnins were buried in the Grady
"omctery nnd Mrs. Lybrand wil! con
tinue to run the store and postofiice,
md will ask for an appointment from
'.he government. She understands the
work and it is hoped sho will be re
tained. I told lies about them or was not fair
'.o each of my opponents."
Tho following letter is self-explanatory:

TO BE IN TUCUMCARI
MONDAY. JUNE 12TH
The Young Democrats met at thu
court house Monday night and four of
tho members debated upon the mt
ject, "Ro it Resolved that Women l
Allowed the Right to Vote in New
Mexico." No judgos were choien and
no decision made as to who won. On
account of there being so mttny othor
attractions in town there was not a
very large crowd present.
Rusiness mattern were tahon up af
ter tho debate was closed and it was
decided to accept Mr. Isaac C Rarth's
offer to visit Tucumcari June 12. Mr.

in the state nnd will no dou it be the
tho Democratic candidate for govern
or. Ho in an excellent npcaker and
entertainer so it was decided thnt the
court house would not hold the crowd
that would come out to hear him and
arrangements will be made to hold
tho meeting in the opera l ouic. A
spec'al program will be held preced
ing the speech. The follow.ng newi
papcr story wilt be of intercut nt thin
time:
"The old printer was really the din
coverer of Isaac Rarth and bin guber
natorial possibilities. We wandvred
into St. Johns, Ariz., in 1002, with a
prospecting outfit, and went to the
Rarth store to replenish our grub box,
Isaac wns sitting in a rocking chair
with a law book on his lemon, some
soda crackers in one hand nnd a slice
of cheese in tho other. He told un to
wait on ourselves, his father being
down in an alfalfa field. A conversa
tion ensued, during which he outlined
his ambition to become n great law
yer and politician, etc., nnd incidental
ly told a couple of funny stories in his
inimitable mnnncr. We recognized a
budding genius and told him tluit New
Mcx'to offered n wide field for such
talents as his. Even nt tr.at early
date it was apparent that he would
,necLplcnty.of room if hp oxnndnd to
n much greater extent. Statehood
was discussed; also the political game,
and finnlly we told him wo c pectod to
hear of his being governor of the
state of Now Mexico some day, nnd
after that a United States senator. We
tioth fell to day-dreaming of the fu
ture then, and Mr. Rarth fell asleep.
Wo quietly departed toward the sand
hills, nnd it comes to mind now that
wo forgot to pay for the .rroceries.
Mr. Rarth will undoubtedly recall the.
incident"
Mr. Rarth promises to be hero the
12th of June nnd the i oung Domo-
crnts will welcome everyone who en
joys a rattling good speech with plen
ty of fun and plenty of brains com
bined for entcr'cinmcnt.

would send a full company, but when
the time came only eight responded
to tho call, most of them being from
Tucumcari or immediate vicinity. Ho
