MRS. MAY HUGHES NOLAND
Unanimonilr Chosen As Musical
Instructor For Next Year.
Lancaster citizens and patrons of the
Graded and High School seem highly
pleased with the fact that one of her
own daughters, Mra May Hughes
Noland, after years of experience
will return to her old home to take
charge of the musical department in
our school next year. She was unanl
mously chosen by the board last week
to this important position. She is loved
and well remembered here by every
one, being a daughter of Judge M. D.
Hughes, of this city. Mrs Noland Is In
every way qualified for this position
and the school Is to be congratulated In
securing her efficient services.
She began taking music lessons in Lan
caster under Miss Juliet Gill, now Mrs
Darnard. She went through a full mu
sic course at Garrard College, studying
under the noted pianist, Prof. Frank F.
Marshall and Prof. Raphael Koester.
She graduated under Prof. Koester and
then took a year's post-graduate
course under him.
She was at the head of the piano and
harmony department of Cotner Univer
sity at Lincoln. Nebraska, for three
years and during this stay in the West,
added to her fund of musical knowledge
by taking a course tn the Conservatory
of Music at Lincoln. 'Returning East
she took a course In the Cincinnati
Conservatory of Music and while there
was the accompaniest for the leading
vocal teacher.
She has taught private classes in
Spokane and Seattle, Washington, and
during the past yeir has had a studio
in Louisville for instruction of piano
and harmony and at the same time has
been Director of Music for the Rich
mond School there, one of Louisville's
best known private Institutions.
Her two bright children, Robert and
Nellie, will be welcomed by their for
mer schoolmates, for they were very
popular during the one session they
were in school here, each of them hav
ing won many honors during the year
just closed at the Louisville High
School.
ATTRACTIVE PROGRAMS
Mark The Closing Of The Lancaster
Graded And High Schools.
Professor Caneer To Retire.
With the closing exercises the Public
school of Lancaster ends one ot its best
and most successful years. Among the
many able principals of this school,
nono have advanced it more rapidly, or
are entitled to more credit for its pres
ent high standing than Professor Ca
neer. For the past three years he has
been at the head of the school and
these years have been the brightest
and most successful in the history of
school life of Lancaster. Professor
Caneer is by nature and education an
instructor. He put his whole heart
and life into his school work. He has
had years of experience and pilots a
school in smooth waters without fric
tion with either his teachers or pupils.
A more practical, thorough school man
would be hard to find and those who
have had the honor of receiving diplom
as from his hands can be assured they
merited thm and have received an
education that is solid and substantial.
It is with regret we see Professor
Caneer and his most estimable wife
leave Lancaster, but we know our loss
will be some other town's gain.
The exercises of the different de
partments of this school attested the
high order of our teachers and their
methods of teaching. The students of
expression under Mrs. Todd showed
splendid, careful end painstaking train
ing. The "Evening of Plays" given
on Saturday evening under her super
vision, was most enjoyable, each one
taking part reflecting credit not only
upon themselves, but Mrs. Todd.
Tho Baccalaureate address Sunday by
Dr. Ganficld, of Centre College, was a
rare treat and will be found printed in
full elsewhere In this paper. .
The piano recitals given by Miss
Webb proved that the teaching of
music had not been overlooked but was
up to the high standard of the other
departments. The parents of the music
pupils say that Miss Webb la most
thorough, conscientious and diligent in
the discharge of her duties, requiring
work and thoroughness from her pupils.
After the recital Tuesday evening she
presented number of prizes as re
wards for practicing the required time.
Wednesday afternoon the pupila or
Misses Anderson and Drashear enter
tained and pleased a crowded audtor-
ium. The address to the graduates
and awarding of diplomas Wednesday
evening by Dr. J. L. Hill ot George
town, was another treat of oratory.
It waa polished, Impressive and splen
didly received by the large audience.
These various exercises that marked
the closing of this school year have
claimed the whole attention and Interest
of the community this week. Alto
gether they show an excellent record
ujider Professor Caneer and his able
efficient corps of teacher.
