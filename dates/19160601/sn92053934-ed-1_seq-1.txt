Message Received in London
Reveals Location of Ant
arctic Explorer.
EXPERIENCES TOLD
Remarkable Escape and Pre
dicament of Some in Ex
pedition, Related.
London, June 1, (1:18 p. m.) A
farther message received today from
Lieutenant Sir Ernest Shackleton, the
Antarctic explorer, whose arrival at
Port Stanley, Falkland islands, was
made known yesterday, shows that the
expedition had a remarkable escape.
After meeting with almost unpre
cedented weather in the early part of
1915, the lieutenant's ship El Endur
ance was badly nipped by great ice
bergs and afterwards foundered. Sir
Ernest succeeded in getting off all
his men and some stores. Terrible
privations were suffered. After a most
hazardous journey the explorer
reached Elephant island. The scar
city of food became so serious that he
decided to leave the greatt part of
his men while he set off for help. Ra
tions for the men left behind were
stored in a hole dug in the ice.
Mates Unique Journey.
After a journey of three weeks such
as probably is unique in the annals of
Antarctic expeditions, Sir Ernest
reached South' Georgia. There he
sought the assistance of whalers for
the rescue of the party on Elephant
Island, but this proved to be impos
sible owing to the prevalence of un
favorable weather conditions.
The message says there is urgent
need of help for the marooned men.
In view of the information received
from Lieutenant Shackleton the plans
of the government for sending a relief
expedition from England will be aban
doned and a whaler will be sent from
the Falkland islands to rescue the ma
rooned men.
After a careful examination of the
text of Lieutenant Shackleton's orig
inal cable. Sir Douglas Mawson, the
explorer, said today:
Ship Crushed by Ice
"Instead of drifting until April 9 of
this year, as has been suggested, it is
quite plain, the Endurance was stuck
in the ice floes from March of last
year until October 27, when the pres
sure became too great. The Endur
ance was crushed and sank on the lat
ter date in the middle of Weddell sea,
"Lieutenant Shackleton abandoned
the sinking ship, dragging the whale
boats and supplies on an ice floe, on
which he continued to drift until
April 9 of this year. It appears that
having at that time reached open wa
ter the lieutenant and his compan
ions launched a whaleboat and sailed
for Elephant island of the South Shet
land group, arriving there April 16.
Makes Trip in Often Boat.
"There the lieutenant left 22 men
in an ice cave and proceeded with five
others in an open boat to South Geor
gia island, where he hoped to meet
whaling vessels and thus get in touch
with civilization. His voyage from the
South b'hctlands to South Georgia, a
distance of 90 miles, in an open 22
foot boat, amid ice, was a hazardous
and remarkable feat, even for so skill
ed a navigator and sea&an as Shack
leton. "The South Shetland islands are in
vented with much ice at this time of
the year and it will not be easy to
reach the men on Elephant island
until later, though no doubt whalers
will be sent now from the Falklands
in an attempt to rescue them.
"It is understood Australia is send
ing a relief party to reach the 10 men
who are stranded on the great barrier
on the Ross sea side, owing to the
breaking away of the auxiliary Au
rora, which was to have met the main
Party when it emerged."

June 14 and will review the procession
and address the marchers.
When a local committee asked the

Unofficial reports from Paris
point to the growing intensify of
the desperate struggle at Verdun.
They declare, however, that despite
the "tremendous efforts of the Ger
mans, the Frenc h first line west of
the Meuse in still unbroken and
that the Germans must scire fnr
ther advances here before they can
force the main issue by carrying
the battle to the opposite bank of
the Meuse where the Bras-Douau-mont-Yaux
line continues to bar a
direct adianee upon the fortress.
The Germans attacked the French
positions here again last night but
were repulsed, according to the
Paris bulletin, the German defeat
following a success for the French
ac hieved yesterday when they cap
tured from the Germans a fortitiod
position southwest of the Hill.
The French launched an often

which is northwest of Verdun.
Jseten machine guns and 22.1 pris

FOR MURDER
New York Dentist Is Sen

Plea Is Refused.
ADDRESSES COURT
Doomed Man Thanks Judge,
Jurors and Attorney for
Good Treatment.
New York, June 1. Dr. Arthur War
ren Waite was today sentenced to die
in the electric chair in the week be
ginning July 10, for the murder of his
father-in-law, John E. Peck.
When Dr. Waite was presented to
the bar his counsel moved that he be
granted a new trial. This was de
nied by the court and sentence was
then imposed.
When Justice Shearn concluded the
sentence, Waite delivered a short
speech in which he expressed appre
ciation of the manner in which his
trial was conducted and his thanks to
the court, the prosecutors and to his
own attorney.
Dr. Waite said he was very sorry
for his crime and for the trouble and
suffering he had caused others. Hs
declared that he hoped that by sur
rendering his body for punishment
he would compensate in some small
degree for the deaths of his victims.
Addresses Court.
Waite entered the court room in cus
tody of two deputy sheriffs, head erect,
step firm and as cool, apparently, as if
there were nothing more serious ahead
of him than one of the tennis games in
which he has so often partTcfpated i
an expert player. He addressed the
court suavely and without a trace of
agitation, although his voice wavered
with an evident touch of feeling as he
spoke of his sorrow for his crimes.
"1 thank the court," he said, to Jus
tice Shearn, "for the very fair and im
partial manner in which it has treated
me. I also thank the jurors for the
courteous manner in which they lis
tened to me. I feel that their judg
ment was justified.
"My sincere thanks are due to the
prosecuting attorney, Mr. Brothers,
who was always nice with me. Mr.
Deuel, mv counsel, is also entitled to
my thanks. He believed implicitly that
I was not guilty.
"I ask for forgiveness. I am very
glad to give my body in expiation for
the things I have done and I give my
soul freely to rectify my misdeeds. I
hope it will go on and on, forever and
ever to purge itself."
Taken to Sing Sing.
Waite was taken back to the Tombs
prison where preparations were made
to remove him at once to Sing Sing.
Wilthin half an hour after sentence
was imposed Waite was on board a
train for the state prison.
When he was searched before going
to the court room this morning a small
pocket mirror, broken in two pieces,
was found in his pocket. The pieces
of glass were taken from him.
ARRAIGN SLAYER
OF AURORA GIRL
Aurora, 111., June 1. Paul Verhoye,
the boy of 19 years who has confessed
that he strangled his child sweetheart,
Gwendolyne Holden, was arraigned to
day before Judge Mazzini Slusser of
the Kane county circuit court at Gen
eva, I1L, on a charge of first degree
murder. The boy said he "did not
know what to plead" and a plea of not
guilty was entered for him by the judge
and the case continued.
With the boy before the bar stood
his mother and father. The father
said he would hire no lawyer to defend
his son, an only child, because he could
not afford it. All that he has in the
world, the father said, is a home which
is not yet paid for. "I cannot let it go
to the lawyers," he cried, "my wife is
not well and I need all the money I
can get to look after her."
The mother said not a word. Tear
stains were on the faces of both par
ents, a sturdy couple upon whom hard
toil had set a mark of stooped shoul
ders ami gnarled hands and worn coun
tenances.
A lawyer, Charles Abbot of Elgin,
111., was appointed by the court to de
fend the boy. The case was continued
to give counsel for the youth time to
acquaint himself with the circum
stances surrounding the slaying of the
l&-year-old girl.

CRISIS EXPECTED
Climax in the Stmpgle Between Em
ployes and Manufacturers Like
ly to Follow Act of latter.
New York, June 1. A crisis in the
struggle between the garment makers
and their employes was precipitated
today by the action of the Cloak, Suit
and Skirt Manufacturers' Protective
association instructing its members
to open their shops and give an op
portunity for the return of their em
ployes who were locked out on April
29. The manufacturers' busy season
begins the first of July and today's
move was taken as a determined ef
fort to get the shops running regular
ly by the middle of June. The em
ployers gave no indication of any in
tention to grant the unions' chief de
mand, which is for a preferential
union shop.
Union officials adopted a defiant at
titude today and sent a swarm of
pickets to persuade workers who
might be inclined to accept the man
ufacturers' offer not to return. The
police watched the cloak and suit
shops to prevent any repetition of
fights between strike breakers and
strikers' pickets such as led to hun
dreds of arrests during the strike of
1910. Morris Hillquit, general coun
sel for the International Ladies' Gar
ment Workers of America, declared
"not a thousand of the 50,000 strikers
will go back."
The employes' union has rejected
the suggestion of President Gompers
of the American Federation of Labor
that it establish commissary stores
for the distribution of food supplies.
President Schlesinger said he had
found that the strikers were too proud
to go to the stores. The union will
continue its distribution of cash to
needy strikers. At the start of the
lockout the treasury of the union held
$500,000, but these funds have been
taxed by the expenses of the past six
weeks and the union leaders are de
pending on contributions from the
public to aid the strike fund.

Kaiser's Men Fall Into Ene

of Dead Man's Hill.
Paris, June 1, ,(11:50 a. m.) The
Germans were completely repulsed in
an attack delivered upon the I-Yench
positions at Dead Man's Hill about 8
o'clock last night, according to an of
ficial statement issued by the French
war office today. A violent bombard
ment continued in this region through
out the night. An intense artillery
duel is in progress on the east and
west fronts at Douaumont.
The text of the statement follows:
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
the bombardment continued with
great violence last night in all the
territory around Dead Man's Hill. A
determined German attack delivered
yesterday evening at 8 o'clock against
our position upon the eastern slopes
of the hill was completely repulsed by
our fire.
"On the right bank of the river, the
artillery fighting has become exceed
ingly intense to the west and also
east of Four Douaumont.
"The night passed in relative quiet
along the remainder of the front.
"During the night of May 31-June 1
a French aeroplane threw down 20
shells on the railroad stations of
Thionville, Audaun and Le Main and
50-other shells on the commissary
headquarters of the ,: enemy at
Azannes."
Greatest Effort of Germans.
More complete accounts reaching
here from Verdun show that the bat
tle which raged from May 27 to May
30 and which ended, according to a
statement of the French war office, in
a costly check for the Germans, was
the greatest effort made by the Teu
tonic forces in the whole Verdun op
erations. More and heavier guns and
denser masses of troops were assem
bled along the three miles of the
French front from Hill 304 to the
Meuse than in any previous attack.
The French stood firm under an
avalanche of shot and shell and drove
back wave after wave of Teutonic in
fantry. They only surrendered about
one hundred yards of ground at Little
Caurettes wood, where a trench had
been obliterated by the terrific fire of
the big German guns.
Great French Success.
According to information given by
prisoners, the German forces consist
ed of two fresh brigades with three
companies of pioneers. The mission
of the latter troops was to work
around Cumieres and reach the Chat
tancourt village by the road running
parallel to the railroad. In the mean
time two other regiments were ordered
to creep along the bank of the river
and seize the Chattancourt railroad
station to the west of the village. An
other brigade was instructed to storm
the woods and hedge rows which bor
der Chattancourt to the west, while
other detachments, acting still farther
to the west, were to support the at
tack. In the opinion of French mili
tary critics the result was not only a
costly failure for the Germans but a
success for the French such as they
have rarely attained.
Suffered Enormous Losses.
The Germans suffered so heavily
that they ceased further attacks while
the French by a prompt counter at
tacks reestablished themselves again
south of Cumieres and won an im
portant point of vantage on the south
western slope of Dead Man's Hill.
It develops that during yesterday's
battle west of the Meuse the Germans
sent back the French lines between
Dead Man's Hill and Cumieres for a
distance of three quarters of a mile.
The French battalions, however, which
had retired before the unprecedented
artillery fire, reformed and made a
desperate cornier attack supported by
reinforcements. After nearly two
hours of violent fighting they recov
ered all the lost ground. The infantry
fighting in this struggle is described
as the fiercest of the war.
German War Kepnrt.
Berlin, June 1, (via London 4:41 p.
m.) In an attack on German posi
tions southeast of Dead Man's Hill on
the Verdun front the French obtained
a foothold in the German first line
trenches over an extent of 400 metres,
the war office announced today. The
French made repeated assaults on the
German lines but other than that at
the point mentioned were beaten off
with extremely heavy losses.
The official statement also says that
east of Ober-Sept (southwest of Alt
kirch), a German reconnoitering de
tachmcnt penetrated into French po
sitions and returned with booty and
prisoners and that a British plane was
brought down west of Cambrai and its
officers were wounded and taken pris
