Kitty's Back
Plays a Big
Movie Part
By D'Loss Sutherland
Kitty Gordon made ncr initial
film appearance yesterday at the
Hippodrome with her $10,000
back and 18 gowns which per
haps were worth even more than
her back.
• Kitty has been a musical com
edy star for years, but has stead
fastly refused to appear before
the flicker camera.
However, the managers of the
World-Paragon brought up a per
' fectly nice insurance agent and
slapped a $10,000 policy on that
part of the actress where the big
V shows below her shoulders
when she wears evening gowns
and she was satisfied. She con
sented to appear.

Miss Gordons way was made
hardfro m the start. The direc
tors deemed she should be one of
those heartless women madly in
love with clothes and not trou
bled with much of a conscience.
Kitty did the part well.
In the beginning of the story,
in fact, during the very Introduc
tory part of the film, a mad-sick
youth shoots himself because she
tires of him and his money has
liegun to dwindle. She lakes the
part of a Broadway actress.
She picks as her next victim a
young clerk who ln order to keep
up the pace his infatuation Is
carrying him, robs his bank of
$12,000, making false entries in
the books. She jilts him for a
millionaire mine owner.
Townsend, the bank clerk,
leaves for the country to forget
and there meets Mary Wlnslow, a
country lass, with whom he short
ly falls ln love. They marry.
Upon his return to the city, ex
pert accounts have discovered tbe
shortage.
Wife Follows.
In a fit of desperation. Towns
end goes to the actress' apart
ments and demands the return of
the money he spent on her.
Ills wife, suspicious of his ac
tions and sensing danger, follows.
She has ben dreaming of a day
not far distance as she worked
dally over baby clothes.
Townsend's demand for money
got a cold laugh'and he leave*.
His wife, however, forces the
signing of acheck covering the
entire shortage.
Their home remains Intact,

"He has been the one sane and
serene spirit which will redeem
this age; and when the election
comes, it will lie found that the
people of America, whatever their
sympathies ln the European
struggle, realize that the one in

The republicans, Baker said,
are hopelessly divided.
"The party is again sub-divided
into those who think the foreign
policy has been too peace-loving,"
he continued. "And then there
Is a lucid group," he added, "led
by the great detractor, who, shift

whatever vantage point seems to
offer an opportunity for making
difficult the position of the presi

Motives Are Selfish.
"The motive of this group
seems to be critical rather than
constructive, and guided by self

that we should stay out when the
tension of events seems likely to
draw us in, and that we should go
in when such recognitions of our

Baker gave the democrats a

Reviewing the Mexican situa

"I cannot tell what the future
may bring forth in this situation,
but for'my part I shall be most
happy If the necessary security
of our people can be obtained
without the killing of another

TACCAVIA. WASH., THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 191 ft
LONDON, England, .Juno 1. — For 1« months
Lady Ernest Shackleton and li.r three children have
waited in vain until today for news from Sir Ernest
Shackleton, lost somewhere in the ley wilderness of
the Antarctic
In October, 1914, Sir Ernest started on the great
est of all Polar adventures —a daring dash across the
length of the South Polar coin incut.
He and his part}' were due ;it lhe Pole last Christ
nias day. They should have reached civilisation in
March 1916, but nothing had been heard from the
explorer until the cable came today From the Falk
land Islands.
No explorer could have a braver wife than Lady
Shackleton. Tall and slight, with ;i I'm*' face framed
in hair jnst touched with silver, dark eyes which
shine with unshed lears as they look toward the map
of the Antarctic that lianas on the wall of her home,
she presents a picture of pm.' nt courage,
Lady Shackleton'fl story of this great South Pole
adventure was given today to Mary Boyle O'Reilly.
Here it, is:
BY l.\l)V BRKKST SIIACKLKTOX.
As Told to Mary Boyle O'l'eilly.
The explorers of the Endurance iliel not plan to claim new land
nor to lind mineral deposits; they sel out to solve the secrela which
the South Polar continent lias guarded for untold ages.
FROM lI.TIMATE MVSTKRY THKV lIKKAMKII OF WRENT
-IX<; TBS EARTH'S QRBATEfIT iBCHKT. IT WAS TO UK THE
EPIC AD\ ENTI HE OF .MODERN TIMES.
To safeguard the exiiedition two polar .hips were equipped—the
Endurance and the Aurora -the first to carry tlie explorers to the
edge of the ice, tlie second to meet the party which sledged from coast
to coast across the forbidden eoiUlin'iit.
For there arc two ways of reaching the Pole —from l.atln-
Anierie-a south to W'eddell sea. and from New Zealand south to Ross
sea and the great ice barrier.
Landing on the shore of Weddell sea the polar route runs south
a thousand miles to a plateau almost the allilit.lt- of .\U. lllaiic.
There In the silence of an ice-white continent is then'ole. Thence
the route runs northward TOO miles across snow crashed hard as
steel, it is the land at the end of the e;*rtli, a region of terrible winds,
treeless and empty of living things.
There July is mi.livli.tci-, mid ( In i-tnias a day with a
never setting sun and the temperature only a few degrees
below aero. In lhe Antarctic seasons im- reversed.
By April •_'_ lhe sun disappears I.clou the northern hori
zon, tlie Ice moves violently, and will. ' June begins the
wintar of an unending night. An Antarctic winter menus
incredible weather, -10 to M decrees below zero, and by Sep
ten.lter the polar stormsr are aw fill.
On tlie last day of 1914 the Aurora sailed from Miiciuarie island
for the great Ice barrier —there to await the explorers' coming from
the pole.
Three weeks later she reached Boss sea base and three of tbe
crew with dogs set out to la,y stores ashore. Next day the e-aptain
and two explorers left the ship with itjores for a sledge journey.
A week later (Jan. 31) six men carrying stores started south
over the ice. March and April passed.
Then on May 6, 1915, a blizzard or hurricane force cracked the
four-foot shore Ice, sweeping floes and rescue ship to sea.
The men were left ashore.
During nine months in the midst of polar blizzards the Aurora's
wireless snapped out "S. O. 5.," but the nearest stations, 1 ,**oo miles
away, were silent, for one-time listeners had gone to the war.
At last, on Aug. 17, came a faint, unintelligal.le message.
The Aurora, laboring round and round a iierg-houiided sea. dis
covered the only exit, and oh April, 19)6, crept into New Zealand.
She was terribly crushed. -.
If Ernest and his companions Coining by forced marches from
the pole reach their goal—Ross, island^they will find the wind-torn
flags of previous explorers, filestores and fuel left by former expe
ditions.
There should be plenty of food and fuel cached on Ross island,
with penguin and colonies of seala-^-at least enough to support 20
men for nine months. But clothing Is more necessary than food, and
skis, wlndproof silk and Balaclava hehjiets cannot be replaced in the
Antarctic. A
