Dead Man's hill on the "Verdun front
the French obtained a foothold in the
German first line trenches over an ex
tent of 4M meters, the war office an
nounced today. The French made re
peated assaults on the German lines, but
other than that at the point mentioned,
were beaten off with extremely heavy
losses.
Germans Repulaed.
Paris, France June L The Germans
were completely repulsed in an attack
delivered upon the French positions at
Dead Man Hill about 8 oclock last night.
according to an official statement is
sued by the French war office today.
violent bombardment continued in th.s
region throughout the nicht. An in
tense artillery duel is in progress on
the east and west fronts at Douaumont.
More complete accounts reaching here
from Verdun show that the battle which
raged from May 27 to May SO and which
ended, according to a statement of the
French war office, in a costly check for
the Germans, was the greatest effort
made by the Teutonic forces in the
whole Verdun operations. More and
he.vl'r evn and denser musses of
troops assembled along the three miles
of the French front from Hill Xo. 3ei to
the Meuse than in any previous attack.
French Gave Little Ground.
The French stood firm under an ava
lanche of shot and shell and drove back
wave after wave of Teutonic Infantry.
They surrendered only about 1M yards
of ground at Little Caurette woods
where a trench had been obliterated by
the terrible fire of the Gennan trfB
suns. According to inforraaxKn given
by prisoners, the German forces con
sisted of two fresh brigades with three
companies of pioneers.

The Germans suffered e heavily that

established themselves aeabi sosrth of
Cumleres and won an important point ot
vantaee en the southwestern slope 3f
Dead Man Hill. It develops that during
Wednesday's battle west of the Meuse
the Germans sent back the French line
between Dead Man Hill and Cumleres
for a distance of three-quarters of a
mile. The French battalions, however,
reformed and made a desperate counter
attack supported by reinforcements.
After nearly two hours of violent fight
ing they recovered all the lost ground,
The infantry fighting m this struggle
