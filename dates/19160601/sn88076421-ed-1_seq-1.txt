REMNSCENCCS OF
JAMES J. HI!
Fred Almy, Veteran Engineer, Was a
Personal Friend of the Great Em­
pire Builder Since Days of 1873.
Fred Almy and "Mitt" Richardson,
old time Great Northern engineers,
left Tuesday for St. Paul to attend
the funeral of their old friend and
employer, James J. Hill.
Altho Mr. Hill was the greatest man
of the age in many way% he was a
personal friend of the men who work­
ed under him and he had a personal
interest in the thousands of Great
Northern employes.
Mr. Almy visited the Independent
office Monday shortly after he learned
of the death of the great man and for
an hour related incidents that reflect­
ed on the noble character of the "Em­
pire Builder" as well as showing how
he interested his men in making the
Great Northern one of the greatest of
railroads.
Mr. Almy knew Mr. Hill well ever
since the days of 1873. He knew Mr.
Hill before he became connected with
the Great Northern, when he was
running a wood and coal yard in St.
Paul, then a comparatively small city.
Mr. Almy remembers when Mr. Hill
manipulated the deal whereby he be­
came the general manager of the rath­
er obscure railroad that extended only
from St. Paul to Crookston. He was
firing one of the old wood burning
engines on that road and he recol­
lects that there were but 23 engines
on the entire system at that time. The
cord wood was piled up along the sid­
ings and it was necessary to stop the
train at every other siding to take on
wood. The poplar wood burned like
straw and kept Fred mighty busy,
but the hard wood did better work.
When the road was extended from
Crookston to St. Vincent, Mr. Hill
superintended the work and stayed
right with the men. He was as com­
mon as any one of them.
The Great Northern was built as
far. as Minot in 1886 and Mr. Hill
spent most of his time with the build­
ers. When the road was extended
from Minot to Helena, Mont., in 1886,
Mr. Hill went ahead with the survey­
ors, riding in an old buckboard. He
was on the job all of the time. The
road was built from-Minot to Helena
in the one year. This was considered
the greatest piece of railroad building
in the history of the world. Mr. Hill
did not have any government land
grants and the road had to stand on
Its own pins. When the men wanted a
raise in wages, Mr. Hill would consid­
er their proposition carefully and if
he thot the road could not pay it, he
would tell them so honestly, but would
state that the raise would come just
as soon as he could afford it. He
never broke his word.
Mr. Almy worked for the road when
it was known as the St. Paul and Pa­
cific, away back in 1873, and he has
been with the company steadily dur­
1,255 NEWSPAPERS
FORCED TO QUIT.
Berlin, May 23.—Three thousand
newspapers and publications in Ger
many have been forced out of busi­
ness, generally on account of financial
difficulties, since the war began, ac­
cording to the newspaper lists for the
imperial postal district. The list for

publications from the list of .1915, on
an average of more than three a day.
Minot Wins Opening Game.
An immense crowd saw the opening
ball game for the season at the Minot
ball park Tuesday evening when Mi­
not again proved too much for Berth
old, winning with a score of 6 to 5.
Lovely pitched for Minot during the
early part of the game but when it

ble southpaw, went in and won. There
were numerous errors on both sides.

JUDGE LEIGHTON CANDI­
DATE FOR RE-ELECTION.
K. E. Leighton, Judge of the
Eighth Judicial district since Jan­
uary, 1911, is a candidate for re­
election. His name will appear on
jthe non-partisan ballot at the
June primaries and as there are to
be two nominees, he is certain to
be one of them. He states that
he will make his real fight in the
fall, but is hopeful of getting a
^majority of a couple of thousand
at least in the primaries. He
knows nearly every man in his
district and his friends are legion.
Judge Leighton graduated from
the law department of the Uni­
versity of Iowa at Iowa City
twenty years ago in June, and
he expects to leave soon for that
place to attend a class reunion.
He has been located at Minot for
fifteen years, practicing law here
until he became Judge of this dis
trict.

ing the past 29 years. The road later
was known as the St. Paul, Minneapo­
lis and Manitoba, afterwards becom­
ing the Great Northern.
Mr. Hill was good to his men and
when differences arose, they always
knew that he would give them satis­
faction. He introduced the system of
allowing them to buy stock in the com­
pany and thousands of them now have
a personal,.interest in the success of
the company, their stock drawing 7
per cent interest.
Mr. Hill did not overlook anything
as he passed over the system. In the
days when old style couplings and
pins were used, brakemen kept piles
of coutilings along the tracks where
they would be handy. Sometimes they
would become scattered. Once when
Mr. Hill visited Minot, he began pish­
ing up the couplings that lay here and
there about the yard and informed
the rrc.n that they ought to be more
careful because they were worth eiifht
cents a pound. He practiced rigid
economy generally, which meant a
saving of millions of dollars for the
company.
Mr. Almy once heard Mr. Hill speak
at the Crookston fair. His wife, to
whom he was most attentive during
their long journey down life's pathway
together, accompanied him. He said
that he had sometimes been called the
"father" of the Great Northern. Walk­
ing over to where Mrs. Hill sat, he
said, "Well, if I am the 'father' of the
Great Northern, I can truly say that
Mrs. Hill is the 'mother,'" paying her
a very beautiful compliment.
Some years ago, an edict was issued
that engineers with defective eyesight
should no longer be permitted to op­
erate engines on the system. This
would have relieved from duty many
of the old time engineers, tried and
true. Mr. Hill learned of this and sent
for them, securing for them glasses
from the very best eye specialists.
Scores of those old time engineers are
still at work on the Great Northern
with perfect records. Mr. Hill de­
clared that it was thru the efforts of
just such men as these that the great
system had been built up and he did
not propose to lose such valuable tim­
ber.
He once told his men that a railroad
corporation was nothing but a piece of
paper with the seal of the state im­
printed thereon. "It's your road and
you are helping to make it a success,"
he added. "While we thank you for
your good work, you wouldn't be re­
tained for one minute if you did not
earn your money."

Northwestern North Dakota's Candi­
date For U. S. Senate Receives
Splendid Press Endorsement.
R. A. Nestos of Minot, candidate
for the republican nomination for
United States Senator, was in the
city yesterday afternoon. Mr. Nestos
is a good campaigner and impresses
one as being a man of very good abil­
ity. He is making a thorough cam­
paign of the state and says he is con­
fident that he will be nominated.—
Adams County Record.
Hon. R. A. Nestos, of Minot, N. D.,
has thrown his hat in the ring for
United States Senator of North Da­
kota. He is one of the progressive at­
torneys of that state, has made good
as a prosecutor, is fearless in the
cause of right, has great ability, the
best of integrity and would represent
his state at Washington all the time.
He would not swerve from the line of
duty, withal he has the physical quali­
ties of manhood so necessary to en­
force his views. His many friends in
this state will rejoice in his nomina­
tion and election, knowing that the
great farming interests of the north­
west will have one more competent
MINOT GETS FAMOUS
WORKING BOYS' BAND.
Minot U. C. T. Succeeds in Giving the
Boys a Real Outing—Two Con­
certs Will be Given.
After a great deal of effort the Mi­
not Council U. C. T. has succeeded in
securing the famous Working Boys'
Band of Minneapolis, for one of the
chief- attractions for the big conven­
tion next week. In order to defray
the expenses of bringing such a num­
ber of boys to this city from Minneap­
olis it was found necessary to bill the
band for two concerts, one on Wed­
nesday evening, June 7th, and the
other one on Saturday evening, June
10th. The people of Minot and sur­
rounding country c^n feel that they
are indeed fortunate in being able to
hear this crack organization, for the
boys are all to the good in the music
line.
This band was organized in 1897,
being fathered by the Minneapolis
Journal. It was seen that the band
organization could accomplish a great
amount of good for the boys of Min­
neapolis, and so charitably inclined
ctiizens of that city got their heads
together and took over the work of
keeping the band going and changed
the name of the band to the Working
Boys' Band. Prof. C. C. Heintzman
was engaged as instructor, and to him
is due the credit for the efficiency of
the boy musicians. Prcf. Heintzman
is a musician of large experience, is a
man of marked ability, good humor,
industry and high character, and he
quickly found a warm place in the
hearts of the boys under his instruc­
tion. It is indeed refreshing to note
the hold he has on the boys' affections,
and the amount of discipline he has
injected into them.
And play—a gentleman from this
city heard this famous band last week
Friday night in Minneapolis, and he
cannot speak too highly of the music
they give. It was indeed a revelation.
It is hoped that our people will turn
out enmasse next Wednesday evening
to hear the boys. Tickets will be sold
by those interested in the event, and
the boys should be greeted by an over­
flowing house.
The band will meet Governor Burn
quist of Minnesota and Governor Han
na of North Dakota at the train next
Thursday and form the escort for
these distinguished gentlemen.
Remember the dates, and be sure
and attend the concerts.
Kick by Horse Breaks Robert Evans'
Arm.
Robert Evans, an aged farmer re­
siding in Torning township, met with
a serious accident Wednesday at noon,
when he was kicked by one of his
horses. He suffered a fracture of one
of the bones of his left forearm and a
painfully bruised hip. He had climb­
ed down from a load of hay to adjust
the harness when one of the horses
kicked, knocking his hat off and using
him up badly. He fainted away and a
young man working in a field nearby,
came to his rescue. He soon revived,
drove the team to the barn and un­
hitched, then summoned help. Two
doctors drove out from Minot and re­
duced the fracture. He will be laid up
a long time.

R. A. Nestos of Minot is a candidate
for the United States Senate. With
two stalwart candidates in the field in
the persons of the great articulator,
now at Washington, and Gov. Hanna,
and with the Non-partisan league in
full swing in the state it is easy to
see that Nestos is going to win. He
will be another Knute Nelson and is
badly needed at Washington. The
present delegation misrepresents the
state.—Dogden News.
R. A. Nestos of Minot has announc­
ed himself as a candidate for the re­
publican nomination for. United States
Senator. Mr. Nestos is now serving
his second term as state's attorney in
his home county. The Reporter has
had the pleasure of making his ac­
quaintance, and take it from me, he is
a live wire and the brothers will make
no mistake when they cast their bal­
lots for Bro. Nestos. If elected, he
will make good.—Ft. Seward News.
Mr. Nestos is one of the strongest
and most consistent progressive re­
publicans in the state, a man of high
ideals and one who lives up to them.—
Grand Forks Independent.
There is no reason why Ward coun­
ty should not have a United States
senator and there is no good reason
why we cannot give Mr. Nestos our
unanimous support.—Minot Messen­
ger.
R. A. Nestos of Minot will begin
this week a tour of the state in the
interests of his candidacy for the re­
publican nomination for United States
senator. Mr. Nestos has resigned his
position as state's attorney of Ward
county and expects to devote all his
time from now until the June pri­
maries in extending his acquaintance
amongst the people of the state and
to make known, as far as possible, his
position of one standing for the prin­
ciples and practices which will serve
the interests of North Dakota people
better than anyone employing the
methods used by his opponents.
Mr. Nestos candidacy is well re­
ceived, although it is yet early in the
campaign. It is already evident that
a good many republican voters are re­
flecting on the question of whether it
is to be McCumber or Hanna or a new
man representing different ideals than
the old time candidates.

SECTION
TOWN CRIERS ClUB
REAOV FOR WORK
Meeting This Week Full of Interest
ing Discussion—Constitution
Adopted.
The Minot Town Criers' Club has
started out on the right track, as was
evidenced at a meeting held this week
at the offices of the Association of
Commerce.
The constitution was adopted and a
lot of routine work disposed of. The
Board of Governors then went into
session and appointed the following
committees:
Membership Franklin Kauffman,
C. E. DeNoon and Will E. Holbein.
Finance Committee—P. L. Andrews,
Will E. Holbein and A. H. Kurth.
Publicity Committee—G. A. Hassel,
Franklin Kauffman and W. F. Jones.
Educational Course and Program
Committee—B. N. Lesk, G. D. Colcord
and L. D. McGahan.
It was decided that the Club should
act as a reception committee for the
Minneapolis Civic and Commerce As­
sociation next week Tuesday, and
badges will be provided so that the
Minneapolis businessmen will find it
easy to secure any information they de­
sire about the city and its environs.
The matter of a Fourth of July cel­
ebration was brought up, and the gen­
eral opinion seemed to be that the
club would co-operate with the Retail
Dealers' Credit Asociation and the As­
sociation of Commerce in providing an
old fashioned celebration of the natal
day.
There is no doubt but that the Town
Criers' Club has a place in the activi­
ties of the city of Minot. Thus far
there is only one club of this kind in
the state of North Dakota—Fargo—
so that Minot is going to secure some
exceptionally good publicity through
this new organization.
The next meeting will be held at the
office of the Association of Commerce
next Monday evening at 8 o'clock, at
which time the program committee
will announce the program for the
first monthly meeting to be held the
following week. It is hoped that an
out-of-town speaker may be secured
for this occasion, and steps have al­
ready been taken to secure such
speaker.
Nearly every line of business is now
represented in the club roster, and
before many weeks it is hoped that all
lines of endeavor will be taking part
in the campaign for good advertising.
The club will become affiliated with
the Advertising Clubs of the World as
soon as possible, and by doing so will
secure much help from the central or­
ganization.
AAKRANN CRYING FOR HELP.
Ward County Independent:
I am swamped with orders for spuds
and none to sell. Be sure and take my
ad. out, please.
M. AAKRANN.
referring to Mr. Nestos candidacy,
calls attention to the fact that North
Dakota republicans are an independent
lot of voters and that no candidate
who does not measure up to the chang­
ing conditions and requirements now
demanded in this state will stand much
of a show this fall.
Nestos is young and energetic and
while classed with the progressive fac­
tions has at all times been a republi­
can and there is no real reason why
members of both factions of that par­
ty could not rally to the support of
such a man.
Nestos has served as a member of
the house of representatives from
Ward county and for the past four
years has been state's attorney. The
Examiner adds: "He is as well known
as any man in the state, other things
being equal and has numerous friends
all over the state who will take pleas­
ure in espousing his candidacy.—
Jamestown Alert.
R. A. Nestos, of Minot, is a candi­
date for the United States Senate to
succeed Senator McCumber. He was
State's Attorney of Ward county, but
resigned to attend to his campaign.
Mr. Nestos is a progressive republi­
can, a real good man, also, and will
make a personal and thorough cam­
paign. There is no doubt but what
Mr. Nestos is going to get a large
vote in this state as many people
think that McCumber has had it long
enough and others think that L. B.
Hanna should be retired to private
life after a long and steady pull in
the public harness.—Percy Trubshaw
in the Valley City Courier.
Hon. R. A. Nestos, of Minot is a
candidate for U. S. Senator. A good
man!—Sharon Reporter.
Stands a good chance to pick the
persimmon.—New Rockford Tran­
script.
It has been reported by some of
McCumber's friends that Nestos has
entered the Senatorial race as a sort
of a tail to Hanna's kite. The fact
that Nestos has become a candidate
appears to have eliminated McCumber
but the Independent knows that Nes­
tos did not enter the contest in order
to give Mr. Hanna a chance to win.
Nestos wants the office himself and
from reports coming in from many
points in the state it would not be at
all surprising if he secured the nomi
nation.—Minot Independent.
