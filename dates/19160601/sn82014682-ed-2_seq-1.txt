Shipping men. In ' Hoholulu are to
day alive to the grave situation which
arose this morning along the entire
Paciflo coast when the; longshoremen
went put on a, general strike. That
Honolulu knd the Hawaiian Islands
are -facing a serious. possibility is the
opinion of everybody along the water
front, and the effect in Honolulu may
be almost as bad as if the strike ex
tended here. With many vessels held
at the coast ports it would.be Im
possible to get mail, and if the strike
continues ; long' the food supply here
is also likely to run short., .
Matson Line Is Sufferer.
The Matsen line will, probably be!
among the hardest. hit of any of the
lines running between Tiere and the
coast. Already this line has three
ships tied up in coast ports; the Ma-
noa and. Enterprise, now in fian Fran
; cisco unloading and loading, and the
, Hyades loading at 4 Seattle.' When the
Matsonla : arrives at Sai: Francisco
June 4, she may be unable, to leave
again until the strike la ever.
' There is approximately 15,000 tons
Matson wharves In San Francisco andj
i seatue. ine aianoa would nave
brought 9000 . tons and the Hyades
5000. - , - -;r '
Luckily the Wilhehnina left San
Francisco yesterday with 6400 tons for
the islands and this t-- Will, probably be
the last shipment of any merchandise
to Honolulu until the strike is settled.
The Luriine will sail on schedule
time . Tuesday with the hope that the'
strike will be over; when she gets
