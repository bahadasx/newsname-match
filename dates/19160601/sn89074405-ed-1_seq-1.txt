TRENCHES NEAR

Center of Bitterest Fighting
Has Shifted, to the
Southwest.
TEUTONS HAVE
TERRIFIC TASK
Must Make Further Advanc

Issue,
London, June 1—The rno
menteous battle at Verdun
shows no sign of slackening
in violence, but the latest of
ficial reports, in contrast
with most of those issued
during the last few days,
record no further advances
for the Germans..
The center of the bitterest
fighting shifted somewhat
to southwest of the front, be
tween Cumieres and Dead
Man's Hill, west of the
MeuSe, wher^rtfre'tjiermans
scored most of Athens tfecent
gains. Dead Man's Hill or
the ground in jtsimmediSte
vicinity has been the scene
of the latest infantry en
gagements. The German at
tack on the French positions
here last night was broken
down, according to the
French statement.
Unofficial Paris reports
point to growing intensity
the desperate Verdun
struggle. They declare, how
ever/despite the tremendous
efforts of the Germans, the
French first line west of the
Meuse still is unbroken, and
that the Germans must score
further advances here before
they can force the main issue
by carrying the battle to the
opposite bank of the Meuse
where the Bras-Douaumont
Vatfx line continues to bar
direct advance upon the fort
ress.
French Capture Trenches.
Berlin, June 1, (via Lon

German positions southeast
of Dead Man's Hill, on the
Verdun front, the French ob
tained a foothold in the Ger
man first line trenches over
a extent of 400 meters, the
war office announced today.
The French made repeated
assaults on the German lines,
but other than that at the
point mentioned, were beat
en off with extremely heavy
losses. 0$
