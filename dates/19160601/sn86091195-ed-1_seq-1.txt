SAD
DEATH OF
ESTIMABLE LADY
The happy farewell party given last
night by the Royal Neighbors In thj
Od<l Fellows' hall to a number of their
members who were going away for the
summer, terminated in a way that is
too sad for words to tell.
Mrs. A. B. Stevens, one of the merry
Neighbors, apparently in the best of
health and Spirits, was overcome with a
fainting spell, when the lady was taken
into the fresh air for a few moments.
When she was returned to the hall,
some of
home, but she refused, saying she was
all right and proceeded to take part in
the song program. About ten minutes
after her return to the hall she again
collapsei without any word of warning,
and it Mas thought that she had again
fainted, but upon investigation it was
found that,she was dead. Her grief
stricken husband was immediately
titied, and had the body removed to
the Bro vn-Eldredge Undertaking Par
lors, where it was prepared for burial.

BEAUTIFUL ME
MORIAL DAY
Clear, blue skies, balmy sunshine, pat
riotic devotion and an abundance of
flowers featured one of the most in
spiring Memorial days which has ever
been celebrated in Blackfoot.
Hundreds of persons visited the cem
etery, laden with fragrant floral offer
ings, and on every soldier's grave in
the silent City of the Dead was to be
found some token of loving remem
brance, memories that have remained
fresh through the passing years.
Twelve little girls dressed in white
acted as (lower bearers to the graves of
thirty-seven (lend but unforgotten sol
diers whose last, resting places were
marked by the stars and stripes for
which they left their" loved ones and
spent the best years of their lives on
tlie battle fields. Prof. Reed, of Poca
tello, delivered a very impressive ora
tion, which was listened to with much
interest- The Kpworth League of til :
Methodist church rendered some very
popular and patriotic music, which was
both inspiring and appropriate.
