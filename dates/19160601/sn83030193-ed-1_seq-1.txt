Says at Inquiry.
William J. Hums, head of thu do-
tective agency bearing his name, was
called to the witness stund to-day at
the wire-tapping Inquiry conducted
by Chief Magistrate McAdoo. to toll
of work he did for J. V. Morgan ft Co.
In getting Information from the
offices of Seymour A Seymour, law
yers, tn the Equitable Mulldlng.
District Attorney Swann had ant
nb'uhoed 'at-th6opontrii of' Uisit-
slon that he would not call Hums,
who waa present with his counsel,
James M. Book, but changed his mind.
Whon Durns was called Mr. Peck said
that ho wus quite willing thai his
client should testify. Mr. Swann ex
plained to the witness thut lilt np-
poaranco In tho chair was a purely
voluntary matter, not ono of com
pulsion. "No Immunity la granted to you In
uny event," bo said, "and your an
swers may b used against you. I
want you to state for tho record that
your testimony is entirely voluntary."
"That Is quite understood," Hums
replied.
After tho usual preliminary ques
tion, Mr. Swann asked tho witness If
ho had ever dono any Investigation
for the J. P. Morgan firm.
"Yes." was tho reply, "nnd I'd like
to tell you tho entire mattur. If you
will let mo."
Thn Hums began Ills narrative.
"Mr. Kgnn telephoned to mo In
March last to suy that there wum a
man naimnl Morton or Mortimer
Hultzor hud called on n corporation
In this city which had a contract
with the Morgan firm, asking for a
commission on the commodity In
question. Ho said thin man had, In
order to convince thu concern of his
familiarity with Morgan affairs and
knowledge of its contracts, offered to
detail the concern's contract with tho
Morgans.
'Mr. Egnn also stated to me that
the man Sultzer was supposed to b
connected with thu law office of
Seymour & Seymour, and thut other
associates of his wero men named
Phillips. Hills and Do Witt.
FOUND TRAILING OF SULTZER
TOO HARD A JOB.
"Mr. Kgnn told mo to get on the
ease at once. I found that Sultzer,
the same man now on trial in tho
courts here, could not bo adequately
shadowed. Ho gave every Indication
that ho know ho was being followed.
The NhuduwH of my office ropmtM
to mo that he would turn a oornor
sharply anil then run half a block
to avoid being tracked.
"Thete things 1 reported to Mr.
Kgan and told him the only way to
do would be to get Into thu Sbymour
offlro or closu to It. Mr. ICgan said
he didn't believe thera'd be any trou
ble ubout this, us the Kquttnble poo
plo would bo glad to know the char
actor of their tenants."
Q. (Hy Mr. Heck) Hud you learned
anything about this man Sultzer? A.
Yes, that ho had passed bad checks
in hotels; that he was under Indict
ment, Hums then took up hm narrative
again, telling of interviews with

William H. C. Walker Tells
His Experiences as an Am

"I have Just left Verdun but I feel
aa If I had obtained a leave of ab
anc from hell," wan tho statement
made to-day by Wllllum 11. C.
,Walec.of Jljughanv Mass... when he
nabbed Now York 'on the French
liner Chicago.
Mr. Walker hns been In 1'rniicu for
a year, sdi-vlng as iiu ambulance
driver for tho American Ambulauco
Hosultal. At tho beginning of Uio
great airman nttuck on Verdun he,'
wus dotulled to carry tho wounded j
back from the front.
"What I saw la almost Indescrlb
ablo," ho Bald. "Tho nearest hoNpltal
was fifty miles from tho front. Wo
would approach tho nrlng lino In our
ambulances and wait thero during
artillery bombardments which lasted
for days. You can Imagine what that
meant one continuous roar of sIioIIh.
"Then tho bombardments would
suddenly stop and thero would be
periods of awful sllenco. Wn of the
umhulanco corps would say to one
another, 'In this war or what Is It?'
During tho periods of terrible silence
we would bo sent out to gather up
tho wounded, of whom thero would
be hundreds.
"Tho looses at Veidun are almost
inconceivable. Of regiments sent to
tho front there would be only hand
fuls of survivors. I expect to go
back, but when my leavj of absence
hns expired I will feel as If I were
returning to tho Infernal regions."
