JUSTICE HUGHES IS
STILL THE FAVORITE
JiiRtlce Charles K. Ilughoa of New
York continues to he the favorite In
the republican presidential contest,
nit hough he still lacks the aanured
nupport of the necessary number or
delegates to make hla nomination
certain
Thoro seeinn no likelihood that a
nomination will come on the first
ballot at Chicago, because of the
large number of favorite sons, and
the pledges that have been made hy
unlnntructed delegates But it neemn
certain that after the flrnt ballot.
nome of the favorite noun will either
withdraw, or see their support quick
1 1 itler, with a possibility that the
nomination may come on the second
ballot.
Since the Oregon primary, on May
19, favorite eon stock haa taken a
tremendous slump. Today there Is
not one among all the favorite sons,
who shows any signs of adding mate
rially to his strongtli after the first
Im'.lot, rattier, the Indication la the
other way.
Tho attempt to check the Hughes
tide has thus far met with no suc
cess. The great difficulty of the un
tl Hughes men is to find a candidate
who can command the support of all
delegates whoae first choice Is some
other candidate than Hughes No
such man haa developed, und what Is
equally Important, Hughes Is the sec
ond choice, and frequently the actual
personal preference of many dele
gates now Instructed to support fav
or, tii tee
Tho talk la strong that Cummins,
realizing that he la out of It, will
withdraw In favor of Hughes after
tho flrat ballot, and perhaps before
the result of the first ballot Is an
nounced. Some of Senator Cummins'
closest friends at Washington predict
that he wil Imake an early jump onto
the Hughes bandwagon.
Ii Cummins doea this, he likely
will atart 11 stampede, for In the
Chicago convention will be a host of
southern delegates who, at heart,
have no particular preference, who
are of tho "bandwagon" type. The
bandwagon delegates keepa his ear
close to the ground, and when he
a particularly ominous rum
ble, he la quick to Jump iu the direc
tion from which the sound cornea.
GONE TO NOMINATE
NEXT PRESIDENT
W. II. Brooke started Sunday ror
the Republican convention He
wuuted to be on the grounds In time
to see all the tire works. Mr. Brooke
will support Hughes on the Brat bal
lot, but will teel Hoe to go to any
one after that.

GOVERNMENT REPORT
ON IRRIGATION
The Culled States reclamation ser
vice in ro operation with the state
of Oregon, have insned a very coin
lli -t report covering the Malheur
110! (Ivvyhee Irrigation projects. The
report Is favorable and covern every
detail that might possibly occur.
The Owyhee project covers about
23,00 acres or land, including the
lands under the Shoestring ditch and
the cost would he about sixty dollars
ie. Thin Is considered prohibi
tive !ii present, but when lands lie
scarce ond the rate or Interest
reduced It In thought It can be made
a good commercial proposition.
For the Malheur project there
would lie about thirty thousand
acres and the coat would run from
111 to Ct. This would Include the
dm nige and allow ror some pump
ing units.
The owners or the lands under the
Warm Springs reservoir project held
an election last week and decided
to organize an Irrigation district
