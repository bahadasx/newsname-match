PLAY BALL1 BATTER UP
Plenty of Material for Two Teams
and Fun for the Fans
Jasper base ball fans propose to liven
things up inavfew days with a ball
game with teams made np of men on
the north side against the south side
The possibilities fur a big time are
great It hasnt been but 10 or 15 years
since some of the fellows played ball
but they are none the less anxious to
risk sore muscles and bruises to show
that they can come back and make
Ty Cobb Bennie Kaull and others
ashamed of their base tunning and
batting Material is sufficient to aDow
each side plenty of utility players and
pinch hitters
How is this for a lineup
North side
E L Crawford manager
Hayzlett Ncbel
Stelner Drake or Smith
Cord Tabler or Creesy
Dan Johnson Insley

South side

Anybody ought to be willing to pay
to sec the game an aggregation like
this would be put up and the cash
be given to the Commercial Club for
road work1

Commercial Club meets tonight
Take a Tip From Mother Nature
Maybe the house needs a coat of paint the fence out
buildings or screens a little dingy How about the
woodwork in the house and the floors Do they need
a little brightening Does vthe furniture show
scratches Painting and varnishing not only beauti
fies but it makes the yrood last longer and its really
cheaper to paint than not
