Had “Put Up a Good Fight, ’’ and Hl*

in Token of Their Admiration
for Him.
The earliest streaks of dawn were
lightening the eastern sky when the
creaking of the windlass and the rattle j
of chains announced that the men ,
I were drawing the stop logs from the j
dam.
With a grand flourish the last log
was laid on the platform and the great }
torrent ot green-and-white water went
foaming down the slide. Then the
boom (hat held back the logs was i
drawn aside, and down they came like
a flock of sheep heading for the fold.
By sixes and sevens they plunged into
the pool below, rising again In the ;
swift torrent at various angles; then :
circling madly round until at last they
made their way through the narrows
and on down the river.
Dave Mordaunt, the foreman, whis
tled gayly as he watched the lor;s pass,
F.ut suddenly ho saw with uneasiness
that the men stationed at the narrows
could not keep the logs moving fust
enough. A Jam was beginning to
form.
“Shut her off," he called, “and hus
tle down here! The narrows are
choked!”
The men swiftly swung out the light
boom and checked the flow of logs.
Then, shouldering their poles, the ton
of them marched after their boss down
the narrow path that led to the lower
end of the bay.
The path was merely a shelf In the
face of the cliff, which rose above It
for nearly a hundred feet. Ten feet
below was another shelf, the lower
path. It was even narrower and more
slippery.
The men loosened the jam, and the
logs once bore hurried down tho
stream. Then they shouldered the long
poles again and started back up the
path toward the dam.
“Hark!” shouted the foreman, hold
ing up his hand for silence. From their
left, above the roar of the water, came
yelping of a pack ot wolves.
“They are after a deer!” cried Ben
Ford.
Even as he spoke the doer came In
sight. It was hard pressed; clouds of
steam rose from Its panting sides, and
Its drooping head and protruding
tongue showed that It was completely
exhausted.
The men cheered as It passed, but
It paid no attention to them. Round
the narrow lower path It stumbled,
and on reaching the narrows, which
were now free of logs, it plunged In.
The rushing current carried It down
the rtver. but It gained the other shore
at last and lay down, panting.
“Now, boys," cried Mordaunt, “the
wolves will follow tho path the deer
took! Gather a lot of rocks and spread
yourselves along the path. When the
wolves are past me I will give the sig
nal. Then let go the stones. After
that you can go to them with the pike.
Don’t let one get through.”
The men made every preparation to
give the wolves a warm reception. In
a few minutes the animals appeared,
six of them, running close together.
As they reached the narrow path they
fell into single file without lessening
their speed. As they ran tney gave
occasional short yelps.
Their tongues were hanging out and
there was foam about their mouths
and gleaming teeth. Without an up
ward glance they ran In between the
wall and the rushing, foaming water,
“Now for them!" shouted Dave.
With a yell the men sent down a show
er ot stones on the unsuspecting pack.
With howls of pain and surprise the
wolves looked up and saw their foes.
Down went their tails and they tried
to retreat; but they were In a trap.
One by one they were pushed off Into
the hurrying water.
Only the leader of the pack was loft
alive. He had been knocked Into the
water by a stone, but had managed to
gain a footing on two logs that were
floating close together. As the logs
drifted apart, he mounted tho larger,
on which he crouched, a picture ot ab
ject fear. The log began to move slow
ly toward the narrows. Nearer and
nearer It came to the mighty mass of
water pouring out through the gorge.
The wolf backed to the far end of the
log and crouched there, shivering.
"I hate a wolf worse than poison,”
said Job Nelson, “but I can’t see that
brute scared plumb to death before
being drowned."
“Neither can I, Job,” said the fore
man, “and he sure put up a good tight
for It.”
The circling current brought the log
to a point just below where the men
stood.
With a spring, Job landed on the
lower path. He stretched out his pole
and drew the log and Its frightened
occupant to the shore. Then he quick
ly rejoined his comrades.
“Now, boys,” he said, “that beggar
must pass you all. Anyone who wants
him can have him."
Realizing that he was frep, the wolf
leaped ashore and slouched along the
path with one eye on the men above.
Not a hand was raised against him.
On reaching the divide he struck ofl
at a swift lope and disappeared from
view.
“Come, boys," said Dave sharply,
“get those logs going again! We’ve
lost enough time already. ’ —Youth’s

S Bg 11. M. EGBERT g
(Copyright. 1816, by W. Q. Chapman.)
Cyrllla was the dearest girl In the
world, but a little cold-hearted. Fred
dy Broughton could not disguise that
fact from his knowledge. But he had
weighed It against her virtues when
be asked her to be his wife, and it did
not weigh a great deal.
Cyrllla Burns and Freddy had known
each other since they were tots. Their
families lived In one of those old-fash
ioned city squares that uro rapidly dis
appearing before the march of pro
gress. Only a few of the old families
remained In the vicinity, and they
formed a sort of aristocracy of birth,
though few of them had any money.
It hud always hocu understood that
Freddy and Cyrllla were to marry.
When Freddy came homo from college
he looked at Cyrllla and wondered.
Here he had been out In the world, as
It seemed to him, tasting the joys of
emancipation, and Cyrllla was going
the same old round of missionary
meetings, library committees and vis
its among a select and exclusive old
fashioned set.
Yet Freddy was shrewd enough to
see that a wife must be chosen for
her wearing qualities. And Cyrllla un
doubtedly did wear well.
So It came about at the annual din
ner party that, finding himself alone
with Cyrllla, Freddy took her hand In
his.
"Will you marry me soon, Cyrllla,
dear?” he asked.
“Yes," answered Cyrllla.
“1 know I love you," answered Fred
dy. “I love you well enough to look
The Struggling, Shrieking Throng Wae
Having a Glorious Time.
forward to taking you Into the world,
where we shall live our own life —a
different life —"
He stopped abruptly. It would never
do to let Cyrllla realize that he had
other views of their future than living
on In the Square. And if a little
gleam came Into Cyrllla's eyes Freddy
did not notice It.
They were to be married In early
autumn. That summer Cyrllla behaved
In an unprecedented manner; she ac
cepted an invitation from a friend to
spend a week up-country.
Left to himself, Freddy pined In hla
father’s law office. When hla vacation
arrived he decided not to take one. He
was moping. Somehow Cyrllla’s let
ters seemed awfully cold. Did Cyrllla
love him well enough to become his
wife? That was the question he put to
himself.
“No!” was the answer that hla Inner
consciousness thundered out one af
ternoon. "No! And lam going to of
fer her her freedom. And I am going
to break away!”
He told his father that he would
take his vacation after all. He went
to the Catskills and selected a little
hotel there filled with shopgirls and
young men from the stores at eight
dollars a week. And there he plunged,
with a sense of awful wickedness, Into
a new life.
The region was simply dotted with
hotels. In every forest glade one came
upon spooning couples. On every lake
rang out the voices of hilarious young
people. Freddy flung himself into It
all with zest. He made desperate love
to a little girl who sold perfumery at
Stacey’s, and had apparently abstract
ed a good deal ot the stock to pour
over herself. He spent the mornings
with her, the afternoons with a ladles’
shoe department girl from Isaac and
Copplnway’s, and the evenings he
strolled up and down with a waitress
from Mild's, and discussed the relative
advantages of the breakfast cereals.
And he liked It. He was growing
more and more entranced with the
vulgarity of It. He felt a regular Don
Juan, and when the hotel gave the an
nual masked ball and the carrousel
was set up Freddy was the gayest of
the gay.
He swung round giddily upon his
horse, side by side with a shrieking
young thing in black, whom he kept
on her unsteady seat at intervals by
ths pressure ot his hand against the
back ot her waist. Then masks wsra
donned, and a perfect whirl of pleas
ure followed.
Introductions are not considered es
sential at that sort of Catskill hotel.
Freddy spun In the giddy mazes of
dance after dance. The struggling,
shrieking throng was having a high
and glorious time when some wag cut
the electric light wire.
Instantly terrific confusion followed.
Girls shouted that they were going to
faint, and fainted in the arms of the
men nearest them. Freddy, embrac
ing an unknown creature, who ley like
a dead weight upon his shoulder, felt
a regular devil. He thought of the
Square with a profound sense ot the
irony of life.
“Help! Make way for a lady what's
fainted!" shouted the landlord's sten
torian voice through the darkness.
And somebody appeared, a dimly
descried shadow, supporting the figure
of a girl, petite and slim, with s black
mask covering what might have been
an uncommonly pretty face.
Tm the boy,” shouted Freddy—hs
had learned that phrase the day be
fore—and snatched the lady from her
escort. The escort, not owning her,
turned his attentions to the nearest
girl. And the struggling mass gradu
ally made toward the doors.
The girl had really fainted. Freddy
carried her, but when be reached the
entrance he felt a sudden disgust for
the crowd. He picked her up bodily In
his arms and made toward the lake,
some fifty paces distant. The moon
had not risen, it was almost pitch
dark, and he could see nothing but the
shadowy trees and in the distance the
level top of what must be the water.
The shouts behind him bad died away,
and Freddy for the first time began
to be frightened.
He tried to arouse the girl, hut her
unconsciousness was profound, and
only the least catch of the breath re
assured him that she was alive. He
decided that the proper thing to do
would be to dash water Into her face.
He set her down at the margin of the
lake and plunged forward to scoop up
some water in one of the tin cans that
lay in numbers among the rushes.
He got his can, and, as he stooped
to fill It, the soft, marshy ground gave
under him, and he stumbled forward
into the water, falling flat on his face.
A minute later a gurgling, puffing
figure, composed, according to appear
ances, principally of slime and mud,
arose from the bosom of the lake, still
clutching the can of water, and strug
gled back up the ascent. For several
moments Freddy hunted disgustedly
for the girl, cursing himself for a
fool. Why hadn’t he been content to
stay quietly In his room?
He loathed himself Just then, and,
In the reaction, thought of Cyrllla for
the first time In a week almost.
Then he came upon the girl, and,
forgetting his condition, he kneeled
down beside her and raised her head
on his arm, and dashed the tepid water
Into her face.
She sighed, and suddenly opened her
eyes. At least, Freddy imagined so,
for he could see only the black shadow
of the mask. He removed It from her
face.
“Where am I?” she whispered In ter
ror.
“It’s all right, miss,” said Freddy—
he had learned that mode of address
too. “Somebody cut the wire and you
fainted. We'll have you back to youi
place In half a jiff.”
The girl was quite silent. Suddenly
the Don Juan mood came over Freddy
again. Deliberately he bent forward
and planted a kiss upon the girl's un
resisting lips.
They were as cold as ice. Suddenly,
with a dreadful sense of horror, Fred
dy leaned forward. In the light of the
lanterns which had been swung from
the hotel porch, Freddy could see that
It was Cyrllla!
And she knew him! She got up and
surveyed him. Her face was Inscrut
able.
“You’re rather muddy, Freddy,” she
said quietly.
“Yes, dear. Fancy meeting you here.
I knew It was you, as soon as—”
“Don’t be untruthful, Freddy. You
kissed a girl whom you didn’t know
from Adam.”
“From Eve, you mean,” said Freddy.
"Well, and will you tell me what
brought you here, Cyrllla? How do
I know what you’ve been doing?”
“I wanted some fun,” Cyrllla said
defiantly.
“Well, so did I,” said Freddy.
She took a step forward. “You
wanted fun, Freddy? Why, you’re
the last person In the world who ever
looked like fun to me. If you knew
how I wanted to break out —”
“My Lord!” cried Freddy. "Cyrllla,
you mean—? I never thought. But
who’s kissed you, anyway?”
“Nobody but you,” she answered.
"They’ve tried to, all of them, but I
wouldn't let them. O, Freddy, you are
human, after all, then?"
He clasped her fiercely in his arms.
“You bet 1 am!” he shouted. "Why,
Cyrllla, this is the happiest day of my
life, to find you out. And we’ll make
our marriage a dream of happiness.”
“And you—you won’t kiss any other
strange girls, then?" asked Cyrllla.
“How many, FYeddy?”
Freddy held up one finger. “Only
you, dear,” he answered. “My, what a
peach you looked, too! Bay, whai do
you think ot getting married here to
morrow?”
“And —and starting now?”
“Right away. But not at this hotel.
A little place I know where there
won't be anybody around but you and
me.”
"All right,” said Cyrllla. “Good luck
to the Square when It discovers that
It has stood for an elopement,"
"I guess we’ll turn U Into a paralle
logram with mortification," answered
(Teddy, embracing her again.
HAVE THOUGHT FOR OTHERS
Soldiers’ Lives Msks Them Kindly to
Each Other In Ever-Present
Fear of Death.
The sight of war cured the writer ot
one notion—that the military profes
sion may tend to make those who fol
low It brutal and cruel. On the con
trary, It seems to make them more
generous and kind. It Is not to be sup
posed that it is war that makes them
so; It Is probable that the removal of
the professional soldier from the field
of conipeiiiis for existence among in
dependent workers' Ann ."business
men” leaves him little chance to‘ ’IkJl,
Into that hungry and foxlike Instinc
tive hostility to one’s fellows that is
developed by the social struggle for
existence. All soldiers, whether offi
cers or privates, seem to be engaged,
on the other hand, in a kind of compe
tition of generosity. It is a great point
with them—a kind of invariable rule
of conduct—to be ready to share what
they have with others. This rule of
generosity does not, of course, save
them from doing cruel things occasion
ally. They have not ordinarily a very
delicate sensibility to one another’s
pain. They do not seem to waste much
pity on one another's physical suffer
ings. They bear their own without
complaint, and seldom ask favors
when they are suffering. > But when It
comes to “grub” or shelter they will
give a comrade, or even a stranger,
better than they have themselves, it
they possibly can. And the work of an
officer, even In the most active and ter
rible campaigning, seems to be easily
consistent with the finest manliness
and most delicate sympathy. And yet
we should not encourage war In the
expectation of cultivating fine senti
ments any more than we should Invite
yellow fever epidemics simply because
a yellow fever epidemic develops fine
cases of heroic self-sacrifice.
BOOK TASTES NOT GENERAL
Pessimistic Conclusions Arrived st by
Investigators of Publle
Libraries.
It la not good mental pathology to
ask the average man to swallow a
book and then look to his tongue as a
means of ascertaining Its effect upon
him, for people In general are less In
telligently articulate ou matters of
reading than on almost any topic, says
the Rochester Post-Express. The li
brarians of several New Jersey cities
have been conducting an Inquiry, the
purpose of which was to find out what
the "literary tastes and habits of read
ing” of the patrons of these institu
tions are. The report forthcoming Is
mildly pessimistic; there is a plethora
of “mechanical readers,” of “lack of
discrimination” and of kindred assets
to taste. It Is quite true that books
seem to go through the minds of many
readers without the outer shell of
meaning being broken for digestion,
but there Is an Injustice in trusting too
much to inferences. The most potent
effect of reading, after all, 1s subcon
scious to most of us. The reasonable
man le not to blame if he simply says
he likes or dislikes a book without
explaining his attitude. The most In
timate likings In life are not asked for
explanations; no man la expected to
tell why he chooses his wife, his tailor
or bis brand ot butter. Why despair
of him as a reader for equal reticence
about books?
Twentieth Century Poetry.
It Is a peculiarity of the new poetry
that Its failure In Interpretation Is so
complete that one poem Is hardly die
tlnguishable from another; and, even
when they are by different writers, one
is not at all rememberable as distinct
from another after 34 hours. They
run together Into a descriptive blur,
the lights of the city softening and
spreading, the cool green depths of
the woods turning to Indistinct shadow,
the velvety richness of the mosses at
the roots of the trees becoming simply
color and then grayness and then
nothing. Under the Influence of the
same experiences, one Imaglst'a view
ot the world would be the same as an
other’s. They are all of them no more
than the medium tor the transmission
of those experiences, the air through
which light passes to the eye, some
times clear air, sometimes misty air,
sometimes smoky air, but always air,
whether a breath ot miasm over a fen
or wind blowing across the hills, al
ways air.—Lewis W. Smith, in tha A'

“But, George,” she said, laying her

LORD OIUE
By IZOLA FORRESTER.
We have been accustomed to hear
Ollle apeak of the Counteaa In, well,
not exactly friendly or comradely or
familiar terms, but as If he knew her
pretty well. For Instance, he would
say when the mall was brought in:
“Another letter from the Countess.
Now I’ll get It for not writing.” Quite
as If it mattered to the Countess
Whether he wrote or not.
He had 00839 to the old-fashioned
boarding house on West Fifty-fifth
street in the summertime. From his
tone and words we gathered that he
was a man of peace and would not
go to war, that the Countess disap
proved of his sentiments, and that his
elder brother was fighting somewhere
in France.
He was a slim, dark, nice sort of
chap, with big, speculative, humorous
blue eyes behind eyeglasses. Until
Jessica came to stay with us, he had
matters his own way in an argument
down In the dining room. The rest of
us were too hungry snd weary to com*
bat world peace or anything else.
But Jessica was different. Fresh
from the West she was, and thorough
ly prepared for war at any moment
She was in the nurses' training school,
waiting for her chance to go abroad
in Red Cross work.
Ollle was all for social evolution,
and the two of them would sit and let
their dinners grow cold while they
thrashed the wars of the nations over
and over again. His name, by the
way was Oliver Grovesnor. Sometimes
his mail came to Mr. Oliver Grovesnor
and sometimes to Lord Oliver Francis
Grovesnor, but we called him Ollle.
A boarding home is a curious com
monwealth. To save your life you
can't help knowing every other body’s
business. We used to run across the
two of them sitting out on tbs little
green wooded bench In the bit of a
front yard talking after dinner.
Then came another letter from the
Countess, the first one since Jessica
had come to stay. Oliver found it un
der his napkin as usual, glanced at It
whimsically, said it was another let
ter from the Countess, and that he’d
get It for not writing.
And Jessica, being a woman, prompt
ly asked who the Countess was.
Whereupon Ollle answered simply:
“My mother.’’
She eyed him from a different as
pect from that moment At first, with
suspicion as if he might be poking
fun at her. You see, Jessica came
from a small town In South Dakota,
and she was twenty-one. She won
dered, Just as we all had, If Ollle were
telling the truth.
Jessica waited until she had him to
herself on the green garden bench.
She approached the subject of Ollle’s
connection with the English nobility
without fear or compromise.
"Is the Countess really your moth
er?’’
“So I have always been told," re
plied Ollle.
“Countess what?”
“Countess of Walslngham. Her
name, though, is Margaret. Margaret
Olivia.’’
“1 blame you more than ever,” she
said briefly and tensely. “Since you
do happen to be born in this particu
lar age and in a certain class, you owe
It to your times, to the spirit of your
times, to stand for the morale of that
class.”
“Rot,” said Ollle, and be opened the
last letter from the Countess. She was
silent as he read It Presently he
spoke in a curious voice, a sort of baf
fled voice, as If fate had handed him
a foul.
“By Jovel” he said. “Poor old
Bert!”
For a minute Jessica didn't get the
portent of his words, be had spoken
so Quietly, but she turned her head
and saw his face, suddenly sharp and a
bit white In the halt light
“Who Is he?”
Ollle stood up.
“I’m going back. She wants me to.
My brother's dead.”
And this is the strangest part. As
he stood there looking down in her
face, suddenly all the little foolish
conventionalities of everyday life
dropped from them.
“You’re going over there to flghtf*
she asked.
“Ot course. Bert died somewhere
in France. It isn’t so much the war,
you understand.” His hands clenched
at his sides. “It’s what they’ve done
to him. 1 want to go and Just give
It to them for his sake, and my moth
er expects me to.”
'Tm sailing on the 10th.” Jessica
spoke eagerly. “I didn't want to tell
you because you had away of taking
all the spirit out of it for me, and 1
wanted to go the other way—believ
ing in it, 1 mean.”
“We’ll sail together,” be told her.
“You said once that I had no morale.
Maybe 1 haven't I don’t like the mess
over there, and I don’t believe In war.
but when the wolf climbs over the
sheep shelter, one grabs a gun, I
guess.”
And then he looked down at her
and said in that simple, square, nlca
way of his we all liked, as If it set
tled the whole thing between them.
“The Countess will think you’re an aw
fully plucky girl.”
' And the next morning they sailed,,
married sure and fast Somehow,
they seemed to take a little of the
springtime with them, perhaps Into
the life of the Countess.
