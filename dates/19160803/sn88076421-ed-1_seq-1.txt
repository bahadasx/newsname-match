FOUR PERSONS
INJURED IN GLEN
BURN CYCLONE
Mr. and Mm. Gillfor Pinned Beneath
Roof of Their Residence—Two
Gillfor Slaters Thrown in Lake
During the terrific cyclone and hail
lorm near Glenburn Tuesday ni^ht,
Mr. and Mrs. Gillfor, who live just
•cross the road from the letter's par
ants, Mr. and Mrs. Myron Hunt suf­
fered the loss of their residence, which
was blown to pieces. The couple were
pinned beneath the roof of the house
•nd would have been killed, but for the
protection of a mattress which fell
across them, saving them from injury
from the timbers. They-were more or
less bruised but not seriously injured.
Mr. Gillfor's sisters, two young wo­
men, were sleeping in a cook car which
was blown away and wrecked. The
young women were thrown out into
a lake where they were frightfully
bruised by the hail stones which fell
thick and fast, some of them as large
as hen's eggs. Their faces are swollen
and cut ana they were pelted unmerci­
fully about their bodies. Their escape
from death was nothing short of mi­
raculous.
C. 0. Carlson of this city made a
trip over a portion of the district on
Wednesday evening. In addition to
damage done to farmers as listed else­
where in this issue, the following suf­
fered complete loss of their crops or
losses estimated at from 50 to 75 per
cent:
L. W. Armstrong, one section of va­
rious crops.
A. C. Dayton, nine quarters.
Mrs. Laing, three quarters.
Claude Randall, one quarter.
Bert Inks, one quarter.
Matt Hamilton, one quarter.
C. 0. Carlson and Erik Carlson lost
three-fourth of their 250-acre crop.
Anthony Walton of this city lost 75
per cent on 400 acres.
V. A. Asplund, 75 per cent on 500
acres.
R. C. Blume, 25 per cent loss.
R. L. Dalziel, 25 per cent loss.
Tom Birkland, 25 per cent loss.
Chas. Matson, 50 per cent loss.
A heavy granary on the Walton
farm was carried 18 paces, then blown
to pieces and scattered along 80 rods.
Gust Olin lost granary and entire
crop.
Geo. Rhodes, Mr. Avery and Chas.
Renfeldt suffered complete losses. Mr.
Avery says the hail that fell at 10 o'­
clock that nip ht could still be seen in
his grove at 7 o'clock the next mom-
larry Christopher's barn was blown
down and a horse killed.
The cyclone tore up many fences,
letting the stock out. Farmers were
out all night long recovering their
stock.
The bell was blown out of the belfTy
at the Gilson school house.
The above is a list of only a few of
the losses. The damage to the build­
ings alone amounts to many thous­
ands of dollars.
Elias Preskey lost 700 acres com­
pletely Schafer iiros., 400 acres, and
Christopher Bros., 400 acres each.
Thos. Hoover was completely hailed
out.
FRED ANDERSON MINOT'S P. M.
Nomination of Well Known Banker
Sent to Senate by President, on
Tuesday—Stenvick Resigns
Fred L. Anderson was nominated on
Tuesday for postmaster of Minot, to
succeed E. H. Stenvick, whose resig­
nation has been in the hands of the
department for some time. The nom­
ination was sent by the president to
the senate Tuesday and some action
will be taken soon.
Mr. Stenvick has not made public his
future plans, but it is reported that he
is about to enter the consular service.
Mr. Stenvick stands Ace high with
United States Treasurer Burke at
Washington, who is said to have tak­
en some part in securing the appoint­
ment of Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson has resided in Minot
for several years. He has been con­
nected with the Brush-McWilliams Co.
and is interested in the First Interna­
tional bank.
I. W. W.'S HAVE REACHED MINOT
One Hundred Arrived in City Today
Over Soo—Sent to Kenmare—
Others Driven Out of Town
The first of the I. W. W.'s who have
been creating trouble for South Da­
kota farmers, arrived in Minot over
the Soo today shortly after noon. Chief
of Police Dougherty and his men had
been warned and were at the depot to
greet the trouble makers. They all
carried the red membership cards.
They informed the chief that they had
come here to demand $4.00 a day as
harvest hands and- would not work un­
less they got their price. The chief
advised them to move on and they pro­
ceeded to Kenmare without getting off
the train.
Another band who had come to the
city were escorted out of the city this
afternoon. They were taken to the
-big bridge, their faces pointed to­
wards the setting sun, and they were
told to move onward.
Two of the leaders were arrested
for vagrancy and are now in the city
jail. They will be given a trial and it
is presumed that they will be given
an opportunity to make themselves
scarce.
The working man finds a welcome in
Minot, but the trouble makers will be
given a decidedly interesting time.
Hail Stones Fell With Great Force
George L. Gould, the Glenburn bank­
er, is in the city on business today. Mr.
Gould says the farmers in the hail
damaged district are preparing to
plow their crops under and in that way
they will be assured big crops another
year. He says that the big storm on
Tuesday night was accompanied by a
vast amount of rain. Mr. Gould acted
as clerk at the C. S. Howell farm, 12
miles north of Minot, Wednesday. He
says that three hail stones came down
with sufficient force to penetrate the
double roof of one of the Howell build­
ings, the roof having been covered
S'th
two layers of thin strips. One
the stones which went through the
roof had sufficient force to break a
show case in the building. Hailstones
broke the sheet iron covering of a van
and dented the sheet iron just as tho
someone had struck it with a hammer.
Great lumps were raised on cattle
which were out in the storm. Mr.
Gould lost a quarter section of crops.
WILL FLOCK TO NORTH
DAKOTA BY HUNDREDS
Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Hilliard of Pasa­
dena, Cal., are visiting old friends in
this city. They spent the summer at
Yakima, Wash., and Conrad, Mont.,
where they have interests. Mr. Hilli­
ard reports conditions better this side
of the mountains and says that resi­
dents of Washington and Oregon will
flock to Montana and North Dakota
by the hundreds just as soon as they
can dispose of their property. He re­
ports conditions very prosperous in
Montana. Farmers are becoming in­
dependent and interest has dropped
from 10 to 8 per cent on the average.
FORDS TAKE A DROP OF $80

ments in the new car that makes the
above propositions very tempting.
Business has been stimulated at the
Moore Motor Co. Mr. Moore finds it
impossible to get enough cars for the
demand.
Greeks Cut Each Other Up
Three Greeks employed by the Great
Northern got into a cutting scrape in
the yards Wednesday" night. They
were all arrested, taken to a surgeon
where their wounds were dressed and
they are now in jail. They got into
an argument and tried to settle their
difficulties in the usual Greek method
—with long, sharp pointed knives.
CHECK
Two Men and Young Woman Make
Get-Away With'New Touring Car
After Working Clever Ruse
A brand new Ford touring car was
secured from the Moore Motor-Co. on
July 21 by two men who gave a forg­
ed check in payment for the same. The
sheriff is now looking for the men who
are undoubtedly well on their way out
of the state. The number of the car
is 1240137.
One of the men gave his name as
Walter Gish. He is 55 years of age,
6 feet tall, dark complexioned, weight
about 185 pounds, straight built and
a smooth face, wearing a dark suit and
black, broad-rimmed hat. He talks
rather slow, but good English. The
other man was known as Mr. Freeman,
27 years, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weig
ing about 175 pounds, fair complexion­
ed, built rather stout, smooth faced
and wore dark suit and black, broad
rimmed hat.
A girl, 22 years of age, was travel­
ing with the men. She has a blond
complexion, is about 5 feet 4 inches
tall, weighing 115 pounds. She carried
her left arm in a sling, claiming the
member was broken, but she may have
done this to elude the officers. A re­
ward of $25.00 is offered. Sheriff
Nedreloe has warrants for the arrest
of these parties.
Matson and Sigerseth Pur­
chase Business Property
Isaac Matson of the Minot Carpen­
ter Shop and Ole Sigerseth of the Mi­
not Decorating Co. have bought the
building and lot occupied by the latter
concern, consideration, $4,400. This
is considered a great snap, consider­
ing the present value of business prop­
erty in Minot. The Minot Carpenter
Shop will soon move to the east half
of tne building.
Mail Carrier Is Thankful
Lewis Dibble takes this method of
thanking the patrons of his mail route
between Drady and Grelland, N. D.,
for what they have done for him, as
he appreciates all the acts of kind­
ness done for him.
Carl Bartelson Buys Valuable Property
Carl Bartelson has bought from
Frank Anderson three 25-foot lots
just south of the new federal building
for $20,000. Mr. Bartelson expects to
build a large block next year. Mr.
Bartelson is a good judge of Minot
city property,, is one of our most pros­
perous contractors and expects to
build a building that will be a credit to
that part of the city.

LOGAN MURMURS

The growth of Logan during recent
onths has been phenomenal. Dad
ean has completed an attractive bun
low, which Mr. and Mrs. Glenn
yers are to occupy, and Curtice Cross
as commenced the development of
is Garden Addition, by the erection
df an imposing residence. Mr. J. C.
Oard is responsible for the addition of
three new buildings, each a credit to
the town, and the excellent opportun­
ities Logan affords will assuredly be
recognized by wise investors. The
icribe who suggested an ability to haul
town, including the hall on a big
he hopes to own, is more anxious
Jpncerning his reputation for face
tiousness .than truthfulness. Brother,
Logan is the town that smothered
Sawyer, and is pushing Minot west.
Burlington and Tasker should bear in
mind that it is the privilege of a flea
to annoy an elephant.
The members of the Samaritan Aid
were the guests of Mrs. Rob Waldref
on Thursday at her picturesque home
which nestles midst the stately trees
which fringe the Mouse river just east
of Logan. The charm and beauty of a
spot, where art and nature blend so
happily, was enjoyed by many and
work, both useful and ornamental, be­
came a pleasure. A delicious lunch­
eon daintily served brought to a close
a delightful visit.
The Latter Day Saints Aid will be

Brady & Myers, our local merchants,

real business, and he does as he says
in most things. Giles, at the Cosy
Cafe has an attractive sign and stock,
and the First State bank will soon
have a volume of business which will
justify the cashier subscribing to the
most widely read paper in the state.
The Hotel Metropole is- the mecca

days.
Miss Anna Willman, who will short­
ly prove up a valuable claim in Mon­

considerable territory in search for a
location more promising than Logan,

The Egan residence on University

Mr. H. C. Kuchenbecker recently ac

Logan needs an organization, com­
prising those who recognize that they
owe a duty to the community in which
they live and wax rich as well as to
themselves. The necessity is empha­
sized on each and every occasion when
enterprise would reach out to proffer
this, that or the other .form of enter­
tainment, or attempt some local im­
provement. The task of collecting
sufficient to defray expenses of per­
forming the preliminary work devolves
upon one or two, the benefit resulting
is enjoyed by all. Without the active
co-operation of each and every resi­
dent little can be accomplished. The
leading financial institution which
graces Main street could and should
take the lead in local enterprises which
affords our town publicity, but they
are painfully backward in coming for­
ward, and it behooves those who have
the best interests of Logan at heart
to appreciate that in these days self­
ishness, while it may temporarily en­
large a bank roll, ultimately will lead
us to acknowledge that we are worth
to the world what we do for the world.
Logan is worth our co-operation and
a united boost.

OF
THE WILD OATS
John Steinberger, Donnybrook Farm­
er, Tells Independent How He
Battles the Pest
This year the farmers are battling
with wild oats as they never did be­
fore. We were talking with John
Steinberger of Donnybrook, one of the
most successful farmers in that dis­
trict, and this is the way he is work­
ing with a quarter this year. Early
last spring he burned the stubble, and
no doubt burned many wild oat seeds
on the surface. A fine crop of wild
oats came on and he cut them for hay
just before they went TO seed, getting
two tons of fine hay to the acre. He
is now plowing the land good and deep
and expects to sow wheat on the
ground next spring. He does not rec­
ommend this method, for he is just
experimenting with it, but he will lat­
er report. Wild oats are much harder
to kill than mustard.
Chas. De Vore, a neighbor, is having
good success getting rid of his wild
oats as follows: He sows timothy with
his wheat, takes off the wheat crop the
first year, then the following he gets
a good crop of timothy, before the oats
mature. He then plows the ground
deep for a crop of wheat the next year.
He has 100 acres of fine timothy this
year. Of course wild oats can be kill­
ed by growing corn or potatoes.
Mr. Steinberger says the crops are
not extra good in his neighborhood
this year. He has some wheat on sum­
mer fallowing that will average 12
bushels, but some of the poorest will
make only three or four bushels. He
thinks it a good thing for the farmers
to get a short crop occasionally as it
will keep many from plunging, but
there are some who will take excep­
tions to this statement.
Editor and Mrs. Fred Roble of Deer
ing were entertained Sunday at the
home of P. L. Ames in this city.
Peter Ames of Williston has been

ing his back.

First Lieut. Gross Writes Interesting
Letter From South—Boys De­
lighted With Beautiful City
A letter received by Mrs. Gross from
her husband, F. Otto Gross, first lieu­
tenant of Co. D., which is stationed
with the North Dakota regiment at
Mercedes, Texas, tells some interest­
ing things concerning the long jour­
ney and camp life.
Mercedes is a small city of 2,000
population, 35 miles from the Gulf of
Mexico and 20 miles west of Browns­
ville, where the Minnesota regiment ia
stationed.
The North Dakota boys are in camp
at the edge of the town, ten minutes'
walk from the postoffice. Mr. Gross
says the weather is very hot but the
boys are training down, have lost all
surplus flesh and will not mind the
weather much when they get used to
it. The North Dakota boys are all in
fine condition, there being no sickness
to speak of in the regiment.
The trip down was rather tiresome,
requiring four days and four nights.
I The regiment arrived in a beating rain
the night of July 26.
1
Mercedes is a pretty little city with
its palm and banana trees and ole­
ander bushes growing as common as
box elders in North Dakota. The
North Dakota boys will have a hard
time getting accustomed to the many
rattlesnakes, horned toads, lizzards
and tarantulas to be found in the vi­
cinity of Mercedes.
Mr. Gross sent the following clip­
ping from the Mercedes (Tex.) Trib­
une, which shows that the North Da­
kota boys have made a real hit:
To the stalwart sons of North Da
kota who arrived to serve their coun­
try on the border yesterday, the Trib­
une, on behalf of the people of Merce­
des, extends a welcome, and though by
no means on a pleasure trip and in
spite of the strenuous activities which
will be a part of your camp life, we
hope you will find the Mercedes people
as hospitable, as big-hearted and as
sociable as the people of your home
state—we can say no more, for the
reputation of the people of the great
Northwest for hospitality is known to
all.
A glimpse of the soldiers as they
marched from the train to their camp
was all that was needed to convince
anyone that North Dakota will give a
good account of herself through the
soldiers now on the border, should the
occasion for action in Mexico develop.
The people of Mercedes are glad to
have them in their midst, and the Trib­
une hopes to become better acquainted
with the men and their organization
before another issue.

THE HALVORSON LOT
Paid S10,000 for $25-Foot Lot on First
Street S. W.—Will Build Three
Story, 50-Foot Building
I Dr. H. L. Kermott, who recently
bought the corner lot from Olaf A.
Olson, opposite the Lexington hotel,
purchased the adjoining 25-foot lot
facing First street southwest from H.
L. Halvorson for $10,00 and will build
a building 50 feet wide instead of 25
feet wide as he had planned. The ex­
cavation for the 25-foot buildiner had
been almost completed. This will give
the doctor one of the finest three-story
blocks in the citv.

Barley 70 Bnshels per Acre.
Major Person started cutting afield
of barley Tuesday at the Person farm
in the valley west of the city. The
heads are well filled and the Major

Cutting Wheat for Hay.
In some localities, farmers are cut­
