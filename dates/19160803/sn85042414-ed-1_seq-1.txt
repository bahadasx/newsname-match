London, Aug. 3.—Without waiving
the right it claims to seize interna
tional securities as contraband, the
government has decided to release a
number of such consignments and
permit them to be forwarded to their
neutral destinations. The foreign of
fice has given the Associated Press an
explanation of this action in the fol
lowing statement:
"In recent months his majesty's
government have detained and placed
in the prize courts a large number of
consignments of securities of enemy
origin, amounting to several million
dollars, passing in the mails between
Holland and certain houses in the
United States.
"Various representations have been
received from the government of the
United States as well as the other
governments concerned. His ma
jesty's government believe they have
the right to treat such securities when
found in the mails, in the same way
as any other enemy exports, and they
understand from the note regarding
mails addressed to them from the
government of the United States that
she does not claim that these securi
ties are entitled to special Immunity
as postal correspondence.
"In view, however, of representa
tions received regarding the' damage
caused genuine neutral interests by
seizures made in the past, his ma
jesty's government have decided to
waive what they believe to be their
strict rights and to release a number
of these consignments and forward
them to their destinations. The al

One Time Knight and Con-
sul Convicted bf
London, Aug. 3.—Sir Roger Case
ment, une-time honored knight of
England, was nanged at 9 o'clock this
morning.
The iorrner knight and consul met
death in Pentonvilie jail. He was
convicted or' conspiring to cause an
armed revolt in Jreland, having
sought German aid to that end.
Two hours before the execution, a
crowd of men and women and chil
dren, gathered' before the prison
gates. Twenty minutes before Case
ment mounted the scaffold, the great'
prison bell commenced to toll. The
sound was greeted with cheers from
the crowd, mingled with some groans.
A minute after nine, a single stroke
of the bell announced that the trap
was sprung. It was a signal for a
mocking, jeering yell from the crowd,
which suddenly died into dead silence-
Casement met death with calm
courage, according to eye-witnesses.
Earlier two priests of the Roman
Catholic church administered the last
rites in his cell. Casement mounted
the gallows firmly and commended his
spirit to God. A moment later the
lever was pulled. He was pronounced
dead at nine minutes after nine.
The coroner's jury found that the
sentence was carried out in accord
ance with law in a humane manner.
Casement's solicitor sought to hava
the body turned over to relatives,-,but
it is said this was refused. solicitor
Duffy said that it was a "monstrous
act of indecency that the authorities
should refuse this request."
The special executioner was a hair
dresser, named Ellis.
An affected incident occurred out
side the prison wall as the execution
was in progress. At the back of the
prison, a iittle distance from the
jeering crowd about the gates was a

Irish men and
bell announced the execution, the lit
tle, group fell on its knees, and, with
bowed heads, remained some time,
silently praying for the repose of its
fellow countryman's soul.
Before going to the scaffold. Case
ment showed not the slightest con
cern over his fate. He ate well, and
chatted freely and cheerily with two
wardens in the condemned man's cell.
He was permitted to wear civilian
clothes, but no collar.
Casement, of a Protestant family,
embraced the Catholic religion in the
last few weeks.
Honored with knighthood—a title
since taken from him by King
George's order—for his many years
of service for Great Britain as consul
and consul-general, Roger Casement
assumed leadership, at a period of his
country's crisis, in the recent Irish
rebellion, the plans for Which were

English warships would capture it.
The crew were made prisoners. The
tramp had been convoyed from Kiel
by a German submarine, from which
Casement and a companion landed
on Irish soil, where they were taken
into custody before their plans ma
tured.
In May. Casement was given a pre
liminary hearing and was committed
for trial on the charge of high trea

Casement pleading not guilty and ut

in Germany's interests and that he
has accepted German gold as a bribe.
The court's verdict was guilty, and
the sentence of death by hanging was,
after appeal by his counsel, confirmed
by the court of criminal appeal, late
in July.
The London press generally ap
proved the fate legally fixed for Case
ment, but in America persistent ef
forts were made to save the noted
prisoner from death. In Washington,
