three days ago that John Bishop,
who is on the Texas border with
his regiment, was seriously ill
with blood poison which Btartcd

The Water Is Fare.
It seems that there was 'doubt
in the minds of some concerning
the purity of the water from the
old well near the top of the moun
tain at Tuscarora Heights. We
have been informed that three
recent analyses of the water have
been made by State authorities,
and the water pronounced unus
ually free from impurities that
would be detrimental to health.

This point of view was brought about by Commissioner of Health, Samuel 0. D!son, who gave orders through
the Dureau of Housing that certain neglected sanitary and housing conditions should be Improved.
.When the matter was pointed out In the above fashion the local authorities, the business men and the clvlo
Wganlzatlons co-operated to bring about an Improvement. The alloys and poor residential districts were thor
oughly cleaned and arrangements wore mado for the regular collection of rubbish. PrlzeB wore offered for the
moat attractive working men's gardens.
Through this co-operation and stimulation of general Interest and civic pride, what was a most unpromising
area bids fair to become attractive. This town's back yard has been made presentable and may now serve as aa
xamole to other communities.
. Snakes Bite Ladies.
One day last week, while Airs.
Emory Thomas, wife of our coun
ty Superintendent, was in her
garden, a snake bit her on one
finger. Blood flowed freely from
the wound, but she suffered no
pain to speak of. A slight numb
ness wa3 all the ill effect. The
reptile was killed. It was one of
the non-poisonous species.
Last Friday, while Mrs. John
Rasp, of Ayr township, was in
the field bringing home the cows
a rattlesnake bit her on the left
foot just above the heel. Infla-
mation and swelling at once set
in, and Dr. Mosser was hastily
summoned.. He rendered what
aid there was, and it i3 hoped
she will not suffer permanent ill
effects. This is the second time
Mrs. Rasp ba3 been bitten by a
rattler on the same foot.
Doctors and others report more
snake bites for the summer of
1916 than have been known for a
long time. Some peculiar atmos
pheric conditions feem to bring
the reptile from their hiding pla
ces out into the open where hu-1
man beings come in contact with
them. One day last week Bert
Doyle, a railroad hand, killed two
rattlers on the east side of Cove
mountain, and on the same day,
surveyor John Taylor killed two
be.low the old tollgate not far
from where Mr. Doyle killed his.
Many others have been seen and
killed, Mr.' Taylor wears two
thicknesses of leggings, having
been struck twice this summer
by poisonous snakes. Twenty
two rattlers have been killed this
far by State Road and sawmill
workmen on Sideling Hill. Wil
liam Bair, of Green Hill, was
horrified one morning last week
to find that two big black .ratt
lers had shared his' cabin on the
mountain during the night Billy
sleeps at Green Hill now.
Killed A Tucasant.
When Scott Palmer was in
town last Friday, he said that
some one had recently run over
and killed a pheasant within sight
ot the store and . Post office at
Sipes Mills. For a long time this
summer, 'the pheasant had been
seen almost daily taking a dust
bath in the road near the store.
The bird was never disturbed and
in this way lost its Ufa through
too much confidence in its human
friends, but it is not thought that
the beautiful bird was killed pur

ONE TOWN'S BACK YARD

A Soldier's Funeral.
DearEditor:-On July 30, 1916,
I witnessed something that I
have not seen, or taken an active
part in for fifty-odd vears. I at
tended the funeral of John Auk
erman, a soldier who was killed
while on picket duty on SantoDo
mingo Island, on the 27th day of
June 1916, and conveyed to the
home of his father in Mt Union
Pa. He was a son of Curtis Auk
erman who married Jennie Gra
cey, a daughter of Thomas Gra
cey (deed j. The funeral was a
sad one. A stout man apparent
ly, lying in his beauliful casket,
in full uniform, who gave his life
of 24 years for his country and
flag. His body was escorted
from Mt Union, to Taylor town
ship by upwards of 30 soldiers in
uniform, and some 20 Boy Scouts
from the same place. There
were also present about 12 or 15
Old Vets of the "Sixties". All
took an active part in laying his
remains to rest at 1:30 p. m. in
Center M. E. cemetery. I was
told that the minister and under
taker was also from Mt Union.
All the honors that could be pos
sible were bestowed. The pulpit
was a mass of flowers and flags
with the same display at the
grave. There were representa
tives of old Vets of the G. A. R.
The soldiers of the present ,day,
Boy Scouts, and I. 0. 0. F. Par
ties who are pretty good judges
of crowds of people estimated
the attendance of the funeral at
five hundred or more people.
They gave him a military burial
by firing a salute of 14 guns three
times across his grave while the
fife and drum corps beat a dirge,
with five flags waived to and fro
at half mast. No doubt there
were many persons saw there
something that they never saw
before,' or ever will see again,
and which I do sincerely hope I
may never see again, a real dead
soldier in full uniform lying in
his casket. All men may learn
from that noble Patriot what a
soldier may have to come to in
defence of his country and flag.
M. D. Mathias.
One- day latter part of last
week, a bumble bee stung George
Comerer, of Ayr township, on
one of his arms. In a shorttime
rn?h and hives broke out all over
his body and he became very sick
and stiff. Very much alarmed
he called Dr, Mo3ser who reliev

Must Pay Two Cents.
Everybody knows that a sealed
letter with a one cent stamp on
it may be dropped into a home
office and it will be handed to the
party asking for it at that same
office, and if the letter has to be
sent to another office, a two cent
stamp must be affixed. But all
do not know that a two cent
stamp is necessary if the letter
is to be delivered by a mail
carrier "to the farm gate.
Let us illustrate. Mr. Troift,
north of town, get3 his
mail at McConnellsburg, and a
letter carrying a one cent stamp,
dropped in at this office, will be
handed to the one asking at the
office for his mail. But if the
Knobsville mail carrier is expect
ed to deliver the letter to Mr.
Trout's box at the farm gate, the
sender must put a two cent stamp
on it or the letter will remain in
the office until Mr. Trout or his
agent calls for it. The law ap
plies to all post offices in the
United States.

Annual Report, Fulton County.
Dr. Nathan C. Schaeffer,
Supt. of Public Instruction,
Harrisburg, Penna.
Sir:
The following is my annual
report of the condition of the
schools of Fulton County for the
year ending Monday, July 3, 1916.
buildings.
We have only eighty-four
school rooms in our twelve school
districts. A few of these being
graded schools, we have seventy-
seven school buildings.
Many of our one room build
ings are old and in poor condition,
but our school-boards are loath
to ppend much money on them
as consolidation is much discuss
ed in some districts.
The districts of Thompson and
locia nave each constructea one
new up-to-date building during
the school year. These buildings
are very attractive and reflect
credit upon the boards of those
districts.
Bethel district divided the
Warfordsburg school and estab
lished in its stead a graded school
This was a much needed improve
ment, as the school numbered be
fore division sixty-seven pupils.
The board deserves much credit
for this progressive step.
I had anticipated that Dublin
district would do the same w ith
the Burnt Cabins school whioh
also numbers more than sixty pu
pils. I am informed by the sec
retary of the Dublin school board
that a petition of the patrons of
the Burnt Cabins school for its
division and the establishment of
a graded school in its place is now
before said board of directors.
Belfast district has decided to
construct a new school building
at Maple Grove to have ready for
use at the opening of the coming
school term.
During the school year, Taylar
district added several large
porches to their school buildings,
and gave both porches and build
ings a coat of paint This added
much to the attractiveness of the
buildings thus improved. This
district also is building a modern,
up-to-date, one-room house at
Hustontown.
scholarship.
The greatest source of weak'
ness in the profession of teaching
is superficiality of knowledge in
the branches to be taught I do
not believe in the dictum that
some teachers teach more than
they know. In fact, no teacher
teaches quite as much as he
knows. It is, therefore, obvious
that any one who has only a
smattering of a subject cannot
teach that subject well. For
this reason I have been most
careful in my examination to se
lect from those persons examined
a sufficient number to fill the
schools having the best qualifica
tions to teach so far as scholar
ship is concerned.
The only means we have in the
county for preparing young per
sons for the profession of teach
ing is the McConnellsburg High
School and the Summer Normal,
We have previously been getting
some excellent teachers from our
High School, but the course has
been so changed in the last three
years as to make it almost impos
sible for the graduates of the
High School to pass a teachers'
provisional certificate examina
tion. The schools of the county
are beginning to feel thi3 loss.
examinations
On June 28th, an examination
was given to the students of the
Needmore Summer Normal. On
June 29th and 30th, an examina
tion was given to the students of
the McConnellsburg Summer
Normal.
The number examined at these
two places was fifty-nine, of whom
fifty successfully passed the ex
amination." ,

December, we adopted in our
course on professional reading,

Chandler Bagley. This text was

DIRTY BREAD.
Little Talks on Health and. Hygiene by
Samuel C. Dixon, !R."D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Even should the process of
making and baking of bread be
sanitary, the loaves are often fsr
from being clean when they do
reach the consumer. It is fre
quently loaded into containers
for the delivery wagon by hands
that have just swept the stable,
curried and harnessed the horse.
Enroute the driver may divide
his time between the dexterous
dandling of the dirty reins or
the smoking of a pipe or cigar
ette. The contents of hi3 wagon
he delivers from house to house
and from shop to shop with his
hands besmeared with dirt from
the stable, horse, harness and
mud or d.i3t from the road.
If he cannot carry enough
bread in his germ laden hands he
takes a loaf under each arm. The
bread that is delivered to the cor
ner grocer may pass through two
or three sets of hands before it
reaches the children's mouths.
If a servant were to stick a
finger in a dish that was being
served you would vehemently
protest but tentimes the careless
ness in the handling of your fam
ily';? bread supply is passed with
out thought If you have any
doubt as to the accuracy of the
observations noted above, nuke
some of your own and imagine the
danger of the transmission of
disease.
No other food is more subject to
contamination from handling
than the "staff of life."
Alfalfa.
We have received a few re
quests for information concern
ing alfalfa. It is getting a little
late in the season to sow alfalfa
this year. While the latter part
of August, just after a shower,
is the time to sow, there is not
time to prepare the seedbed prop
erly. The ground mustbe plough
ed and harrowed, then after
grass and weeds have started,
they must be killed by harrowing
and this must be done several
times until very little more wiil
come up. If this is not done,
the alfalfa will surely be smoth
ered out by weeds and grass,
if you have a patch of ground
that has been well cultivated this
summer, say a potato patch, and
if it has been limed, you might
try alfalfa on it Unless the seed
is inoculated, you may have to
try the same piece of ground two
or three times before it 'catches'
The reason for this is that each
time seed is sown, a little alfalfa
will grow. Then in a year or
two, enough alfalfa bacteria will
have been created in the soil to
enable a full crop to lay hold on
that particular piece of ground.
Always try the second and third
time on the first piece of ground,
if the first sowing failed. But
the first sowing should not fail
if weeds and grass have been
killed, lime used, and the Peed
inoculated. Have the seedbed
well settled, and do not loosen it
up very much at the time of sow
ing. Badly Injured Elbow.
Last Friday, while a hand wag
on wa3 being brought down Cove
mountain, . Duffield Sipes got on
the wagon which wa3 loaded
with wood. In some manner the
wagon upset, and in falling, Duf
field struck his elbow on the
hard surface of the pike and
bruised his elbow so badly that
it was thought some of the bones
were fractured. He went to the
Chambersdurg hospital and had
the X-rays turned on, but a care
ful examination revealed no
broken bones. The injury was
very painful." Mr. Sipes -lives
near the tollgate at the east end
of McConnellsburg.
Mr. and Mrs. George E. Clous-
er, near Big Cove Tannery, were
interested spectators while wu
were at pres last week.
