RAILROADS ARE TO FIGHT
JERSEY CITY RULING
Prohibiting Shipping or Storage of
Explosives Within City Limits.
New York, Aug. 2. Following a
conference of officials of - railroads
with terminals in Jersey City here to
day, it was reported that the railroads
would fight the resolution adopted yes
terday by the board of commissioners
of Jersey City, designed to prevent a
recurrence of the Black Tom Island
explosion, by prohibiting the shipment
or storage of high explosives within
the city limits. The report was to the
effect that the railroads would apply
jointly to Federal Judge Relsta.b at
Trenton for an injunction restraining
the city commissioners from carrying
their order into effect.
At the offices of the various rail
roads concerned it was eaid that some
such action was contemplated but
nothing definite had been decided upon.
The Lehigh Valley railroad announced,
however, that it was ready to comply
with the commissioners' or3er and had
in fact already issued an embargo
against the transportation of high ex
plosives over its lines.
Director of Public Safety Frank
Hague announced tonight that he is
prepared to carry into effect the pro
visions of the commissioners' resolu
tion. Police will be stationed at every
point where railroads enter the city, he
said. They will be instructed to halt
all freight . trains and if they learn
from the conductors' manifests that
high explosives are carried on a car
they will insist that these be detached
before the train is permitted to enter
the city limits. If the train crew re
fuses to comply with the order, they
are to be placed under arrest immedi
ately, charged with helping to main
tain a public nuisance and menace.
There was another explosion scare
among Jersey City officials late today
when Si.'pt. Michael Mulligan of the
Lehigh Valley railway reported that
the smoldering fire from tons of siiar
stored in Ave of the warehouses was
spreading to two freight cars loaded
with high explosives and shrapnel at
the extreme end of Black Tom Island.
The cars had been buried under debris
and could not be removed to a place
of safety. The fire and water poured
on it have turned thousands of tons
of sugar into a syrup that spread over
much of the island.
Shrapnel shells in the piles of debris
were exploded by the intense heat in
such numbers that more than 50 labor
ers working near the Are were ordered
away and a "dead line" was established
under police supervision. The first
court action growing out of the explo
sion was instituted today in the su
preme court by Dominick Lannie, a
truckman. Lannie demands $15,000
damages for alleged injuries sustained
as a result of the blast and names the
National Dock and Storage company,
the Johnson Lighterage company, the
Lehigh Valley Railroad rompany and
the Central Railroad of New Jersey as
defendants.

IUG TIMMIN5 .REPORTS
Notified United States Neutrality
Squadron Outside Hampton Roads
That the Submersible Had Put to
Sea.
"Washington, Aug. 2. The tug Thom
as F. Timmins, which accompanied the
German merchant submarine Deutsch
land down the bay from Baltimore,
reported to the United States neutral
ity squadron outside Hampton Roads
tonight that the Deutschland had
passed out of the capes at 8.30 p. m.
The Timmins' message was picked
up by the destroyer Sterrett, which
relayed it to the Norfolk navy yard.
The destroyer then was outside the
three mile limit to see that the sub
mersible's passage out was not inter
fered with by the allied cruisers off
the capes until she had passed out of
the territorial waters of the United
States.
The commandant of the Norfolk
navy yard sent the following to the
navy department:
"U. S. S. Sterrett reports: 'Subma
rine reported by tug Timmins to have
passed out the capes at 8.30 p. m. Am
outside tljree-mile limit.' "
DEPARTURE FOLLOWED
EIGHTEEN MILE DASH
Whether She Submerged Before
Reaching Three-mile Limit is Un
known. Norfolk, Va-, Aug. 2. The Deutsch
land's departure to sea followed an
eighteen mile dash through the lower
Chesapeake bay. After proceeding
slowly most of the way down, she in
creased her power at 6.30 and reached
the capes just after dusk. None of the
allied cruisers was visible as she pass
ed through.
Disappeared Unharmed.
Whether she submerged before
reaching the three-mile limit is un
known. The two accompanying boats
only knew that she disappeared un
harmed and that to all appearances
she had a clear field ahead to a point
where she could completely submerge
in safety.
Half an hour after the last light of
the Deutschland had disappeared, the
Timmins, seemingly satisfied with her
work, turned back and headed up
Chesapeake Bay in the direction of
Baltimore.
During part of the day the Deutsch
land had remained hidden at a cove
up Chesapeake Bay.

Xew York, Aug. 2. A series of in

NOTE FROM GERARD ON
FEEDING OF CIVILIANS
Transmits German Refusal to Accede
to Birtish Proposals.
London, Aug. 2, 7.55 p. m. The note
from James W. Gerard, the American
ambassador at Berlin, transmitting
the German refusal to accede to the
British proposals to have a neutral
commission feed civilians in occupied
areas was received today at the for
eign office but too late for comment
there.
Unofficially, however, it is known
that the contents of the German reply
are quite unlikely to end the contro
versy as it is contended the reply does
not answer adequately the British
proposals.
It is probable the foreign office in
the near future will transmit through
the American embassies at London
and Berlin a demand for a more cate
gorical reply to the original proposals.

Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, today made, known to The As
sociated Press that .it was the British
government's determination not to re
prieve Sir Roger.
No Official Announcement.
Beyond tho statement of Sir Lobert,
which was in defense of the govern
ment's determination, no official an
nouncement to the effect that the exe
cution will be cariied out tomorrow
has been made public. Officials inti
mated to The Associated Press, how
ever, that this is quite the usual pro

execution, the only occasion for an
official announcement being the grant
ing of a reprieve or a commutation of

While the government maintains si
lence as to the final efforts made on
behalf of Sir Roger, it Is known that
petitions were received as late as to
day. The foreign office says no com
munication has been received from the
state department at Washington re
questing a reprieve.
To Let Law Take Its Course.
The whole subject surrounding Sir
Roger's case has been seriously con
sidered by the cabinet and the deter
mination to let the law take its course
proved unalterable. The decision of
the government will cause some sur
prise as the opinion had become wide
spread that the sentence of Sir Roger
would be commuted at the last mo
ment to life imprisonment.
Lord Cecil's Statement.
Lord Cecil's statement to The As
sociated Press follows: "No doubt of
Casement's guilt exists. No one doubts
that the court and jury arrived at the
right verdict. The only ground for a
reprieve would be political expediency,
CLOSE OF INTERNATIONAL
SOCIALIST CONFERENCE
Two Men and One Woman the Audi
ence at Closing Session.
The Hague, Aug. 2, via London, 8.1 S
p. m. .Two men and one woman were
the entire audience at the closing pub
lic session of the International Socialr
ist Conference here today. It was an
nounced at the meeting that the Nor
wegian delegates had now received
promises of safe conduct from the
German government, but they were too
late ajid that the Spanish delegate
was held up in London by other
causes.
The conference adopted a resolution
condemning an economic war after
the war and favoring free trade and
freedom of the seas. The delegates
also recorded their .protest against the
sentence of Dr. Karl Liebknecht, the
German Socialist leader, and others
who had suffered punishment for their
anti-war convictions.
Algernon Lee, the American dele
gate, speaking on the free trade reso
lution, said that American socialists
had not hitherto gone deeply into that
aspect of the question. The situation,
however, had now become vital, he
said, and was of interest also to the
Americans, The resolution, he de
clared, would serve to stimulate op
position to protectionism in America.

LAW TAKE ITS COURSE
a difficult ground to iput forward in
this country.
"This country never could strain the
law to punish a man for the same rea
son that it could not strain the law to
let one off.
"The Irish rebellion began with the
murder of unarmed people, both sol
diers and police. No grievance justi
fied It, and it was purely a political
movement organized" by a small sec
tion of Irish people who still hate Eng
land and was assisted by Germany.
Casement Assisted Rebellion.
"There was and is in this country
the greatest possible Indignation
against these people. There is no
doubt that Casement did everything
possible to assist this rebellion in co
operation with the Germans. There
can be no doubt that he was moved
by enmity for this country.
"The contention that he' landed in
Ireland for the purpose of preventing
tHe rebellion is demonstrbaly false. No
such assertion was made by counsel
at the trial.
"Casement was much more malig
nant and hostile to this country than
were the leaders of the rising who
Were caught with arms in their hands.
He visited military prisons in Ger
many with the intention of persuading
Irish soldiers to throw off their alleg
iance. Ail sorts of promises were
made for the improvement of the con
dition of these men to induce them ta
join an Irish legion. An enormous
majority thus approached refused and
thereafter were subjected to increased
hardships by the Germans. From
among these Irish soldiers a number
has since been repatriated as hopeless
invalids and they subsequently . died.
They looked upon Casement as their
murderer. . I
"Nor is there anv ground, puhllc or
private, so far as we know, which can
be quoted in mitigation of Casement's
crime and I do not think any govern
ment doing its duty could interfere
with the sentence which ha3 been
passed on him."

resulting from the occupation of Mexi
can territory by American troops on
the other, or the processes which
brought the de facto government ii.to
power.
Great stress was laid on the fact
that a speedy report was desired from
the commission by both governments.
