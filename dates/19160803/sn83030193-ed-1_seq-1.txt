.Jf warning In Pontonvllle Jail for high
traaaon. He wu convicted of con
spiring to cause an armed revolt In
Ireland and with having sought Ger
man aid to that end.
Two hours beforo the execution a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered beforo tho prison gates.
Twenty minutes beforo Casement
mounted tho scaffold tho great prison
bell commenced to toll. The sound
wns greeted with cheers from tho
crowd, mingled with soma groans.
At I o'clock tho crowd had swollen
to auch proportions that it extended
for two blocks from the prison front.
At ono minute after 9 a single
stroke on the big bell announced that
the trap had been sprung. It wns the
signal for a mocking, Jeering yell
from tho crowd which suddenly died
away Into dead silence.
At tho buck of tho prison, a
little dlstnnco from tho Jeering
crowd about tho gates, was n group
of about thirty Irish men nnd women.
When tho single dull clang of tho
prison bell announced that the
doomed man had paid tho Inst pen
alty this little group fell on their
knees and with bowed heads ro.
malned for some moments silently
praying for tho reposo of tho soul of
their dead fellow countryman.
Casemont mot his death with ca:.n
co-rage, acco Mug to eye -Uncases.
Early In the morning two priests of
the Roman Catholic Church udmln
Istered tho last rite- In tho cell of the
condemned man b.t,x shortly after
ward a llttlu procession headed by
the clergymen, with Cusement follow
ing, a warden on either side, pro
ceeded toward tho execution shed,
only flvo yards away. The priests
rtclted tho litany of tho dying, Caso
ment responding In low tones: -d,
have mercy on my soul."
ILLI8, THE BARBER EXECU
TIONER, LOBE8 NO TIME.
Aa tho party reached the shed
where the gallows was erected, the
special executioner, a halr-dressor,
named Ellis, u burber from Houhdale,
who got (23 tor his services, ap
proacbed Casement and quickly pin
toned him. Tho two chuplalns, the
Undar-Bhorlff of London and tho Un
der-sheriff of Middlesex, then took up
their positions In front of tho scat
fold. Casement mounted the. gallows
steps firmly and commended his spirit
to God as ho stepped on the trap. A
moment later tho lover was pulled.
Tho prison engineer nnd tho phy
Iclan descended Into the pit under
the scaffold, where, after the appll-
cation of tho usual tests, Casement
waa pronounced dead at nlnn minutes
after 9. According to the custom In
the cats of prisoners hanged for
crimes similar to that of Cnscment
his body wns burled In nulckllme, in
