BULL MOOSE ISN'T HERr
AS "LEADERS'*WISH
Efforts to whip the Progressive
into line for Hughes according to
the Chicago program have laneo.
The stirring scenes at the meet
ing
01'
the Progressive State Com­
mittee of New Jersey, in Newark,
when ha Buu Moose hotly resist
ed the attempts ol* certain lead
ers lo pledge I lie party in that
state to tile Republican ticket
was a warning that Progressives
are nut going to submit to tlw
destruction of their principles
•nor to the barter of their votes.
.By a vote ol' 7 to 5 the state
comiiiiitoe of New Jersey Pro
gressives repudiated the action
of the Nationai body at Chicago,
and will not bind itself to its
actions.
The managers of the President
campaign feels that they have
reason for gratification with re
spect lo the bull Moose and In
dependent vote. Hundreds of
letters and communications have
been received at the National
Com mine headquarters, the
headquarters of the Woodrow
Wilson Independent League and
at tno White House lroin Pro
grssivcs ana Republicans as we.l
who decalre their intention to
vote this year for Wilson, "the
man who has kept us out of war."
Progressives Shout* Support the
President
Edgar C. Snyder, chairman of
the Progressive Party in the state
of Washington, has written a
flaming denunication of the Chi
cago coalition and says: "1 am
supporting President Wilson and
feel that all Progressives shuld
support him."
Ole Hanson, one of the fore
most Progressives ol" the West
who was a candidate for the
United States Senate in the state
of Washington, and polled 83,
282 votes, is supporting President
Wilson and vainly challenging
Senator Poindexter lo debate is
sues.
From all parts of the country
there are cries of consternation
from Progessives over the man
ipulation of their "leaders."
Their bitter protests at the treat
ment of their party at Chicago,
indicae clearly that they will,
give their support to President.

NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS
GIVEN FEDERAL AID
The farmers of North Dakota
will be given Tederal aid this
year in securing harvest help.
A special federal «gent is now
working in co-operation with H.
F. Flint of the slate department
of labor at Bismarck. This a
genl in in close touch with agents
in other states to the east and
south, and as the harvest work
[is complfrked in those sections,
will assist in moving the labor
from those sections to places
where they are needed in this
state.
The effectiveness of this work
will depend much upon the ac
curacy with which the depart
mailt is informed as to the needs
of each specific section. Com
'niercial and Farmers C^ubs are
!asked to help in this work. Care
l'n 1 attention to these matters at
once will save much loss to com
munities by distributing the lab
or where it is most needed.
