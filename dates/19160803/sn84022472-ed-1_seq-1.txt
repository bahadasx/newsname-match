Transferred to- Health
Board's Funds. :
At a conference this morn
ing between the chamber of :
commerce and the : board of
health, called at the "instigation
of Dr. Abraham Sophian, it be
came known that City Planner,
John Nolen estimates Bridge-,
port will need accommodations,
this winter for 9,000 more fam-" ,
ilies, or in the neighborhood of
30,000 persons.
This, together with the fact , that
the chamber of commerce, . departing
from the custom of such civic bodies
in opening their deliberations to the (
public formed the chief features of
today's conference.
The deliberations . of the .housing
committee have been held uniformly
in secret, while those of the board of
health - heretofore have i been open.
The reason ascribed by Secretary
George Gove for. the secrecy Is the
fact that plana are now being f or-
mulated; for - the erection . of many
houses .in Bridgeport which Is not '
deemed wise for the public to know
until all details have been complet
ed. ' .'- .
In addressing the "a.ssem'bled mem
bers of the two departments today Dr.
Sophian - said that conditions in
Bridgeport are very poor, the tens- '
ments already built are greatly, over
crowded and that there are not suffi
cient accommodations. These facta
he said resulted ln poor sanitary con- v
ditions, ''"'HeV'aBked what seps ara
now being taken by. th chamber (of
commerce to alleviate the situa
tion. .'. ' '
In reply he was told that the cham
ber of commerce had been' studying
conditions for several months, that
it .had agreed about 3.000 new houses
were needed, but tnat city Planner-
John Nolen, who recently had been
employes lir-aw. advisory capacity as
serts in his. report that 9,000 family
units are required in Bridgeport and
its vicinity to care for those expected
in this city next winter. ,'
Dr. Sophian and the board of
health were Informed in confidence
of projected plans for building the
needed accommodations. ,
Those present, at the meeting today
were Dr. Sophian, wiinam u. oepp
and Frank. W. Stevens, for the board
of healthy George Crawford, president
of the chamber of commerce and A.
H. DeLoss an George Gove, mem
bers of the chamber.
Aroused at last to a realization that
every. effort must be made to co-operate
with the health board in Its fight
to check the spread of infantile para
lysis here,: the public works depart
ment of the administration has seen
the light and is lending aid in the
crusade to clean up the town. Dirty,
usty streets no longer will be toler
ated. Clogged gutters and stagnant
pools wht6h have existed ln many sec
tions are being cleaned of . refuse.
These gutters have been cleaned rare
ly except in the spring and fall "clean

More than 125 extra men are now
employed cleaning the city streets.

regularly employed and there are now
