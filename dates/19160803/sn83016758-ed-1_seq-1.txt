RIOTOUSLOAFERS How the I. W. W. Agitators Exploit
the Deluded Miners on the
Iron Range.
Scathing Denunciation By the Leading
Labor Newspaper of
Minnesota.
That the miners on the iron ranges
have grievances that should be re
dressed is highly probable. That they
are justified in striking to enforce
their demands, if every other means
fails, will not be denied by any one
who has a genuine friendly feeling for
the cause of labor. Nor will it be
disputed that for the protection of
their interests organization among the
miners is necessary.
As a general rule the sympathies of
the great bulk of the general public
are with the members of organized
labor in their efforts to better their
conditions, especially as is the case in
many instances, when those conditions
are intolerable. But when the strikers
resort to violence, attempt to take
human life and destroy property, they
immediately lose the sympathy of the
public.
That the miners on the iron range
and their employers could and would
have arrived at an amicable under
standing long ago had it not been for
the pernicious I W. W. agitators is
the opinion of those who profess to
understand the situation. But these
professional labor agitators fatten on
trouble, and the longer the trouble
lasts the fatter they get. This ex
coriation of the mercenary I. W. W.
bosses and their methods is not taken
from the columns of a corporation
owned newspaper, but from the Min
nesota Union Advocate, one of the
ablest and cleanest labor journals in
the United States:
"The rebellious and riotous organiz
ation which calls itself the 'Industrial
Workers of the World,' seems unwill
ing to leave unused any opportunity
to show the cloven hoofto demon
strate that the two impelling forces in
its activity are greed for money and
love of strife, the latter always bring
ing some temporary notoriety and
ijjausir.g an outpouring of coin.
"It is the custom of this lawless and
dare-devil organization to send its
agitators to places where there are
groups of foreign workers ignorant
of our language, our laws, our insti
tutions and their own rights there
under. These agitators stir the work
ers up to revolt and frenzy against
their employers. Then, when all the
money the workers can raise is safely
deposited in the pockets of the agita
tors, they lea\e their deluded victims
in helpless destitution and at the
mercy of those same employers.
'"I W. W. agitators did this in Law
rence, Mass where the courts had to
be invoked to conmel them to dis
gorge thousands of dollars the col
lected for the benefit of the strikers
and kept for themselves They did
the same thing at Little Falls, N.
where they put the whole community
in serious straits and then fled to
other fields of exploitation. They are
now causing disastrous strife in the
harvest fields of the Dakotas against
the wish of both employers and work
ers whereby the harvests of golden
gram are left ungarnered, while their
own harvest of golden gram is steadily
gathered in.
"These birds of evil omen have re
cently spread their darkening pinions
over the iron range in Minnesota and
started a reign of terror there. Many
miners on the range quit work to
force improvement in their working
conditions, which had become in
tolerable to them. As soon as the
strike started the I. W. W. agitators
flocked into the region and took
charge of the situation. Miss Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn, a notorious member of
this class, was sent to act as general
of the miners in the conflict, and she
announced in blood-curdling terms
what would follow. Meanwhile, Wil
liam D. Haywood of xlious reputation,
secretary-treasurer of the organiza
tion, began collecting funds ostensibly
for the relief of the strikers, and he
is now living in luxury in Chicago, far
from the scene of strife.''
Rural Credits and Road Laws.
The Federal good roads and the
rural credit laws, considered together,
form an impressive contribution to the
progress which the agricultural in
terests in America are making, espe
cially on the economic side of rural
betterment. The rural credits act isn't
exactly the measure that some earnest
advocates of the legislation desired
it introduces too much the element of
government aid in financing the Fed
eral land banks, in their initial stage,
to suit others. But it is an important
constructive measure, introducing in
principle at least an institution of
agricultural banking and credit which
has been highly developed in Europe
for years, and which has been much
needed for a long time in many parts
of the United States. In saying,
when he signed the bill, that he felt
confident it would have wide-reaching
benefits, President Wilson voiced the
general sentiment of those who have
given to the problems of American
agricultural life their close attention.

Fatal Accident.
Hed L. Swanson, a respected resi
dent of Dalbo, Isanti county, was the
victim of a fatal accident Monday af
ternoon at 3 o'clock, when his team
became frightened at an automobile
on the West Branch bridge. Mr. Swan
son and his son, Ole, it appears, were
just leaving for their home, driving a
team hitched to a wagon. When on
the West Branch bridge an automo
bile driven by August Thoma ap
proached them. Knowing that his
horses were not accustomed to motor
vehicles, Mr. Swanson jumped down
from the wagon and siezed the bridle
of one of the horses with the intention
of leading the team past the automo
bile. The horses became frightened
and lunged forward. A tug hook be
came entangled in one of Mr. Swan
son's trouser pockets and he was
hurled under the wagon. Two wheels
passed over his thighs. The unfortu
nate man was taken to the North
western hospital at once. No bones
were broken, but it is very evident
that serious internal injuries resulted
as Mr. Swanson breathed his last at
9 o'clock that evening.
Deceased was a native of Sweden,
and has been a resident of this coun
try 14 years, having resided in Dalbo
all of that time. He was 62 years of
age. The widow and five children
survive him, viz: Andrew, Louis and
Ole, at home Mrs. John Elvin ol
Wyanett, and Miss Ida who is also at
home.
The last sad rites are being con
ducted today from the Dalbo Swedish
Baptist church.
Sunday School Convention.
The annual meeting of the Mille
Lacs County Sunday School associa

church at Milaca on Saturday and
Sunday, July 29 and 30. The sessions
were largely attended and all three
districts of the county were repre
sented.
The programs carried out were in
spiring and instructive, and the vari
ous papers read were particularly
valuable.
Officers for the ensuing year were
elected as follows: Mrs. Guy Ewing,
president, Princeton Mrs. Hilda Nor
gren, vice-president, Foreston Clint

The total assessed value of personal
property of Mille Lacs county as re
turned by the assessors is $782,701 as
compared to $773,021 last year, an
increase of $9,680. Money and credits
have shown a falling off. Last year
the assessors returned $245,550, while
this year money and credits are given
as $216,202
The assessors found 1,948 sewing
machines in the county, and the
assessed value of same is $5,203.
Princeton village has 324 machines.
Watches and clocks have decreased
since 1915. This year the assessors
listed 1,738 as compared to 1,771 last
year. The average assessed value is
$1.64. The towns of Borgholm and
Milaca returned no watches or clocks.
Princeton village leads in the number

The aggregate valuation totals $2,540.
An Important Thoroughfare.
One of the most important thor
oughfares in the state will be the road
from Brainerd and the Cuyuna iron
range to Minneapolis, via Mille Lacs
lake, Milaca, Princeton and Elk River.
It is a much traveled highway at the
present time, and the travel is con
stantly increasing. It will be the
shortest overland route from Aitkin,
Brainerd and the Cuyuna range to' the
Twin Cities. Moreover, it is the first
link in the proposed great scenic high
way from the Twin Cities to and
through northern Minnesota.
No time should be lost in putting
this important stretch of road in first
class shape its entire length. It is in
fair condition now and many improve
ments are at the present time under
way on that part of the road that
traverses Mille Lacs county. Ere
another twelve months roll around we
hope the road will be permanently
improved its entire length from Brain
erd to Minneapolis.
Permanently improved means that
the road will have to be widened in
places, some kinks straightened out,
wooden culverts replaced with cement
structures and every rod of it hard
surfaced.
This looks like a big job, but with
the aid that can be obtained from the
state and nation, intelligent co-opera
tion on the part of the local road
authorities and the owners of adjacent
real property it can be accomplished
by September 1, 1917.
Let all interested bend every energy
to complete the first link northern
Minnesota's Scenic Highway within
the next twelve months. It can and
must be accomplished. Intelligent and
united action is all that is necessary.

Shall We Play Ball?
Shall Princeton have a ball team?
This question must be answered by
the fans, and unless the team is sup
ported more generously than of late
operations will be suspended. There
is now a deficit the treasury, and
the management cannot be expected
to do all the work and finance the
team also. Do your share by being
attendance at the game next Sun
day.
Princeton has an excellent ball team.
The boys play a fast and winning ar
ticle of ball, and the contests are in
variably interesting. The team is en
titled to support, and there is no rea
son why the games should not be
generously attended.
The Hitching Post Question.
A petition was circulated yesterday
requesting the village council to have
the hitching posts removed from Main
street and last evening the council
adopted a resolution in accordance
with the wishes of the petitioners.
Undoubtedly the streets can be kept
cleaner if teams are not permitted to
stand thereon for any length of time.
But Princeton is a farmers' town and
when the farmers come in to do their
trading they should be put to as little
inconvenience as possible.
Green Lake Dance Saturday Evening.
Owing to a mixup of some kind or
another it was announced in last
week's issue that there would be a
dance at the Green Lake pavilion last
Saturday evening. The dance is to
be held next Saturday evening, Aug

"Mike" Reports That Local Company
Is In Better Shape Physically
Tftan Any Other Company.
The Boys Are in Good Spirits and
Bo*, Race and Wrestle After
Hard Day's Work.
Llano Grande, Texas, July 27.
Wet4weather
at the front and as
most of the boys have turned to letter
and card writing to wives, sweethearts
and friends back in the Gopher state,
it behooves us to get busy and write
up some of the news of the last week
before facts and fancies become so
badly mixed that we are unable to dis
tinguish one from the other. For the
last two days afternoon showers have
broken up the military program of
the higher-ups and the men have been
confined to their tents "for the good
of the service." We get warm, gentle
showers that lay the dust and cool the
air and insure a good night's sleep for
the men. The weather for the last few
days is almost identical with the aver
age Minnesota July weather, and at
times it is hard to realize that we are
almost 2,000 mile from home.
Beginning last Monday the work be
gan to tighten up a little and it ap
pears to be the idea to whip the men
into shape as soon as possible and the
gradual hardening in process goes on
with unabated zeal. To a man up a
tree it looks as if the National Guard
is being prepared for any eventuali
ties. And who knows what may hap
pen? At present the entire border
seems as calm and peaceful as a mid
summer day and the plans for settling
our border difficulties with Mexico go
forward without any apparent hitch.
However, who knows just when the
country will again be thrown into an
other feverish turmoil by some Mexi
can bandit raid on one of the many
isolated towns strung along our far
flung southern boundary line? And
then another "tempest a tea pot"
and another spasm of Wilsonian dip
lomatic notes to an illiterate mixture
of Spanish adventurers and Aztec In
dian blood. But, being mere cogs in
the whole machine, we can but keep
on*#ojng ur paji and test the general
result take care of itself.
Locally the border difficulty seems
to be a thing of the past and we have
enough friendly Mexicans and
around this camp to make up a regi
ment of Mexicano generalissimos to
turn over to Friend Carranza or Foe
Villa at a minutes notice, depending
on which of the aforesaid gentlemen
could make the biggest promises to the
prospective generalissimos. These
Mexicans around here appear to be in
dustrious, thrifty persons who mind
their own business and apparently are
happy and contented in helping the big
northern brother whip his soft soldiers
into shape for a possible invasion of
their native country. Mercedes, our
market town three miles east of us.
boasts of a population of 1500 and
this is split 50-50, half American and
the other half Mexican, and they have
had no local trouble with the natives
during the whole time that Mexico has
been on the rampage, since the down
fall of Diaz.
NOTES.
We also have a large open-air mov
ing picture theater in camp, where for
10 cents the men can enjoy an evenings
entertainment.
The company is still in good spirits
and even after their hard day's work
you can find them boxing, foot racing
and wrestling in the company street.
The camp is thoroughly cleaned and
polished now, and the danger from
poisonous reptiles, insects and bugs,
so common in Texas, is practically
eliminated.
The numerous drills and exercises
have made a big improvement in
company and the people at home
would hardly recognize us now for the
same contingent that entrained for
Fort Snelling on the 26th day of June,
just one month ago.
Sunday.afternoon the indoor base
ball team defeated the company
team from Eveleth, by a score of 8 to
4. In the forenoon two picked teams
from our company battled for suprem
acy and the bunch captained by Sergt.
Smith won out 14 to 3.
The company fund so generously
provided by the good people of Prince
ton has been a God-send for the men
and has been used judiciously and
economically by the commissioned
officers of the company in providing
extra necessities for the men that
Uncle Sam does not have on his
regular army program.
Some of the men are out of tobacco,
cigarettes, writing paper, and toilet
soap. Any of these things would be
greatly appreciated by the men. All
food products sent through the mails
are strictly tabooed here so don't try
to send any of mother's home cook
ing to the boys as it will never reach
them. This order is from the medical
corps and is strictly enforced.
The camp now boasts of about 30
stands or canteens, where you can get
almost anything to eat or drink that
one wants, and most of the men dine
out occasionally just to break the mo
notony of the camp mess. No intoxi
cating liquors are allowed on the
grounds and the men are prohibited
from bringing any of it into their
quarters. As Mercedes is a dry town
under an old land grant that contained
a prohibitive liquor clause this Llano
Grande place is just as dry as our own
home town.
company is in better shape physi
cally than any other company in the
regiment. The water, the new and
strange army rations, the change of
climate and mode of living has played
havoc with some of the companies in
this camp, and the sick call, at 6:30
every morning, sees a large gathering
of the invalids at the red cross tent of
each regiment. To be sure most of
these cases are minor ills and com
plaints, but occasionally a serious case
develops. However, when you stop to
think that we have in this camp ap
proximately 1200 men it is not strange
that we have some business for the
medicine men, both of a minor and
major nature.
"MIKE."
Liutenant Morton Writes.
Lieutenant Morton, who is with com
pany at Llano Grande, writes the
Union entertainingly of camp affairs.
He reports that the Rum river valley
boys are getting along in good shape,
although Anthony Speeder of Fores
ton is at the base hospital at San An
tdne receiving treatment for a slight
attack of bronchitis.
The company, regimental, and offi
cer's streets are graded better
fashion than any of the park boule
vards. It is not done for show either,
but in order to take off the water in
case it should rain. The ground bakes
so hard that there is no chance for the
water to seep in, and consequently it
would leave the camp in bad shape if
there should come one of those drench
ers without the drainage having been
attended to. It is said that rain falls
only once every 18 months, and there
was a precipitation just before the
Minnesota boys arrived, but they be
lieve in safety first.
The newspapers of the south contain
little or no news anent the Mexican
situation, and papers from the north
are eagerly read.
The thermometer goes up to about
106 or 107 along the border, but the
nights are cool, and a gulf breeze day
and night affords considerable relief.
Then, too, the boys are kept so busy
that they have very little time to
think of the heat. As they become ac
customed to conditions border life is
more agreeable to them.
Village Council Meets.
The village council met regular
session last evening. Mayor Newbert
presided and all members were pres
ent with the exception of Councilman
Smith.
On motion made, seconded and car
ried the reading of the minutes of
the previous meeting was dispensed
with.
The hitching post proposition was
considered and a motion to have same
ordered removed from Main street
carried. The motion also contained a
provision that arrangements be made
to have hitching places provided else
where.
Frank Stahnke, local manager of
the Illinois Oil Co., was granted per
mission to erect and operate a filling
station on the Christopher premises,
First street.
No other business came up for con
sideration, and after acting on the
usual grist of bills the council ad
journed.
Fire Destroys Residence.
The Conrad Arnholdt residence in
the southwest part of town was com
pletely wiped out by fire Saturday
morning, and most of the contents
were also destroyed. It is presumed
that a defective chimney is responsible
for the conflagration.
The alarm was sounded at 10:30,
and the fire department responded
promptly. The department boys la
bored valiantly, but were handicapped
by insufficient water pressure. Buck
ets were used, and although the ad
joining house to the north-became ig
nited the firemen managed to subdue
the blaze before any damage to speak
of resulted. Under the circumstances
the department did creditably. The
VOLUME XL. NO. 33
boys worked like Trojans, and a couple
of them received severe burns as a re
ward for their zeal.
The fact that during the dry spell
numerous citizens sprinkle their
lawns with city water may account in
part for the insufficient pressure. The
firemen maintain, however, that the
pressure is not what it ought to be
even under the most favorable circum
stances, and that they should be pro
vided with an engine and a pump.
Kicked By a Horse.
Amel Anderson was seriously in
jured at noon last Friday while spray
ing his dray team with "Shoo-Fly."
He was in the stall between the horses
and the animals became frightened.
They squeezed him and finally he fell
to the floor. While Mr. Anderson was
down one of the horses stepped on his
right hand, and he was severely
kicked in the head. A fractured skull
and a badly lacerated hand resulted.
Amel was able to get up and leave the
barn, and he was taken to the North
western hospital at once, where Dr.
Cooney operated on the head injury
and dressed the hand. It was indeed
fortunate that relief was immediately
obtainable as it is extremely doubtful
if Mr. Anderson would have survived
had the services of a skillful surgeon
not been available at once. Numerous
friends will be pleased to learn that
the patient is getting along fully as
well as can be expected.
An Unruly Steer.
An angry steer that was being led
forth to slaughter by A. C. Smith cre
ated a little excitement in the street
between the stores of the Evens Hard
ware Co. and E. Nelson & Co., Monday
evening. The animal was tied to the
rear of the meat wagon, and suddenly
became violent. The "critter" charged
trees, brick buildings and finally
jerked the rack off of the wagon.
Fred Newton volunteered his assis
tance at this juncture and he siezed
one end of the rack. He was careful
to avoid the end to which the steer was
attached and for a few minutes Fred
and the steer had a continual round
of pleasure. Round and round they
went, while numerous spectators ap
plauded. The animal was finally sub
dued and tied to a tree the street,
and Geo. Weisbrod changed the vicious
"critter" into a dead "critter" by -rap
ping him on the head with a hammer.
Our Boys in Texas.
Our correspondent at Llano Grande
intimates that the fund that was raised
for Company before they left for
Fort Snelling is exhausted. The boys
do not stand need of eatables, but
there are many little necessities that
would be appreciated. The best way
would be to raise a little fund and
send it to the treasurer of the com
pany, Sergt. Grover Umbehocker, who
will see that the same is properly ex
pended. The Union will guarantee to
acknowledge and forward whatever
amount may be subscribed. Do it now.
Whatever is received will be for
warded by the latter part of next
week. Hand in your subscriptions
before next Thursday. We will not go
around begging subscriptions, but will
gladly forward anything that may be
voluntarily contributed.
A Former Princetonian.
Captain W. A. Carleton of the
United States regular army is quar
termaster at the Llano Grande camp
in Texas with headquarters at Mer
cedes. Captain Carletca is a former
Princetonian, and his mother and
sister, Mrs. I. M. Carleton and Mrs.
J. F. Petterson, are esteemed residents
of this place. If the Minnesota boys
are not properly cared for it will not
be Captain Carleton's fault. The posi
tion of quartermaster in a c'amp of
several thousand men is a most im
portant one and indicates that Captain
Carleton's superior officers have con
fidence in him.
Drowned at Lewis Lake.
On the evening of the 24th ult. Gus
tave Nelson, a resident of the town of
Dalbo, was drowned while bathing in
Lewis Lake. A young man named
Ed Ostrom was with Nelson at the
time. Neither could swim. They
were both holding onto a boat and
floundering around in the water when
Nelson sudenly let go and disappeared.
The body was recovered the same
evening.
He's Good for Another Term.
The newspaper boys who are trying
to pick a candidate for United States
senator from Minnesota two years
hence are wasting their efforts. Uncle
Knute Nelson has about 50 years more
of good hard work in him, and no man
in the history of the commonwealth
has been a more efficient or faithful
servant of the people.St'. Cloud Jour
