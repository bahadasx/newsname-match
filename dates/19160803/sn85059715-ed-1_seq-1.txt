LONDON. Auk. 3.?Roger Casement,
former Iiritish knight and consul,
was hanged at 9 o'clock this
morning in Pentonvllle jail for high
treason. He was convicted of conspiring
to cause an armed revolt In!
Irelnnd and with having brought German
aid to that end.
Three hours before the execution a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates.
Twenty minutes before Casement
mounted the scafTold, the great prison
bell commenced to toll. The sound i
was greeted with cheers from the
crowd mingled with some groans. At
9 o'clock the crowd had swelled lo
such proportions that It stretched for
? Kinni,u frmn flip nrison front. At
/l?u UiUVIlu HvJ .... ...
one minute after !l a single stroke of
tin big bell announced that the trap
had been sprung. It was the signal j
for a mocking, jeering yell from thej
crowd, which suddenly died away into
dead silence.
Casement met his death with calm
courage. Early in the morning vyo j
Catholic priests administered the last
rites in his cell and shortly afterward |
a little procession headed by the.
clergyman with Casement following j
a warder on either side proceeded toward
the execution shed only live1
yards away. The priest recited the j
litany of the dying, Casement re-j
spending in low tones:
"Lord have mercy on my soul."
As the party reached the shed J
where the gallows was erected, the j
special executioner, a hair dresser
named Ellis, approached Casement
and quickly pinioned him. The two
chaplains, the under sheriff of London
and the under sheriff of Middle- j
sex thcD took up their position in front
of the scaffold. Casement
^ mounted the gd",..ws steps firmly and
A commended his spirit to Cod as he "?"""i
"" the trap. A moment later
(rn,|/K
the lever-was pulled.
Immediately after the trap was'
Sprung the prison engineer and physician
descended into the pit where
after the application of the usual test
Casement was pronounced dead at,
nine minutes after 0. According to!
the custom of prisoners hanged for
crime similar to that of Casement Ills:
body will be buried in quicklime in
Die prison yard but probably no decision
as to the burial will be made
until after the inquest
An affecting incident took place
outside the prison wall as the execution
was in progress. At the right
of the prison a little distance of the
jeering crowd about the wates was a
group of about thirty Irish men and
women. When the dull clang of the
prison bell announced that the doomed
man had paid the last penalty, this
little group fell on their knees and i
with bowed heads remained for some!
moments silently praying for the repose
of the soul of their fellow countryman.
Ellis, the executor, arrive in the
prison early last evening and immediately
made his preparations. He
examined the trap door In the execution
shed and tested it thoroughly
with a bag exactly the same weight]
as Casement. Ellis remained in the I
I prison all night.
Casement showed not the slightest |
concern over his fate. He ate well j
and chatted cheerily with two warders
in his condemned cell. After a
hearty late supper, he divested himself
for the last time of his convict
clothes and went to bed. He was notified
that he would be allowed to
wear his own civilian clothes for the]
execution though would not be per-j
mitted to wear a collar.

Jr fair members of the new element in
the political life of the state and they
liavo been told to go as far us they

women have been gathering for the
past 21 hours for the purpose of
greeting Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
president of the National American
Woman Suffrage Association, who
will sound the keynote of the campaign
at the .Masonic Temple tonight.
It is interesting to note tlie methods
of the women of West Virginia as
they go about their campaign for the
vote. Quiet and dignified in their
demeanor; pulling no stunts as do
too many of their sisters in the larger
states, yet showing their colors
In no uncertain way. they nre impressing
the people In general and
the voters in particular with their
sincere and carenst desire to have a

Fathers McCarrell and Carey of Eden]

said that his overpowering

According to him, the Inst
words of the dead man apart from Ills
prayers woro:
"I die for my country."
Father McCarrell said that ho
found Casement to be a beautiful
character and that he never instructed
any one in his religion who showed
himself a quicker or more promising
learner.
All hopes of an eleventh hour reprieve
were dashed to earth yesterday
with the Statement of Sir Lord
Cacll, parliamentary under secretary
of foreign affairs that no government
doing Its duty could interfere
with the sentence. Supplementing
this were the dramatic disclosures of
Lord Newton 111 the House of lairds
that the Germans recently shot two
Irish prisoners who refused to Join
Casement's Irish legion.
At the Inquest the governor of the
prisoner and the chief warder testified
that death was instantaneous.
Dr. Mander was asked hy Solicitor

in the statement published whether
Casement had been insane. He replied
:
"I saw no evidence of insanity. Ikacted
in a sane manner to the end."

The German tramp ste unship on

year was blown up by its own crew
wt.i n the latter foresaw that it was
inevitable that the blockading Lngiisn
wa-shlps would capture It The crew
were made prisoners. Tbetramp had
been convoyed from Kiel by a German
subtn-.rlne, from which Casement and
a companion landed on Irish soil,
where they were taken into custody
before their plans matured.
In May, Casement was given a preliminary
hearing and was committed
for trial on a charge of high treason.
Late in June the trial was begun, Casement
pleading not guilty and uttering
a denial thnt be had worked In Germany's
Interests and that he had accepted
German gold as a bribe.
The court's verdict was guilty, and
the sentence of death by hanging was,
after appeal by his counsel, confirmed
by the court of criminal appeal, late
in July.
The London press generally approved
the fate legally fixed for Casement,
but in America persistent efforts
were tnnde to save the noted prisoner
from death. In Washington, a
resolution was introduced in the Senate
which would hnve President Wilson
intercede with the British government.
and numerous petitions received
at the White House from many
sources asking that a plea for clemency
be cabled. The Senate resolution
was not accepted. President Wilson
took no official action. In England,

of foreign affairs in Russia removes
the only obstacle to the full
sway of the bureaucracy under Prime
Minister Stunner. Sazonoff Is a liberal
minded statesman, who had a
i long experience as a diplomat in
I other countries and who was anxious
| to wage the light for Russia's increased
greatness, at the same timet
promoting wholuHomo reforms within
the empire. The return to the
ministry of the interior of Alexis
: KhvostotT, as reactionary an official
as exists today amoung the subjects
of the czar, follows the fall or
Sazonoff in natural consoquenco. The j
j changes in the cabinet are madoj
right after the dismissal of the
duma by the czar following the recommendation
there of new laws under
which the peasants would receive;
the full enfranchisement as Russian
citizens.
A year ago, when the czar's soldiers
were falling back In Poland and
yielding one fortress after another
j to the Germans and Austro-Hun- j
j gnrians, the Russian bureaucracy
j permitter the reform legislator of
the duma to cherish the hope that op-1

j Russian soldiers are advancing, the

of recuperation, the bureaucracy
of Petrograd feels Itself secure. It
once more defies the people. The
darkness of the night of bondage
holds In its grip all the subjects or
