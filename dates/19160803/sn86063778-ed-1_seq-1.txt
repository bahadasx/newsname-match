| AMMUNITION AWAITING SHIPMENT
EXPLODES AT BLACK
TOM ISLAND.
LOSS OF LIFE NOT LARGE
Fire on Barge Believed to Have Ignited
Great Stores of War Supplies
For the Entante Allies.?Shock Felt
in Five States.
Now York.?Property losses estimated
at $25,000,000 were caused by a
series of terrillc explosions of ammunition
awaiting shipment to the Entente
Allies and stored on Black Tom
Island, a small strip of land Jutting
into New York Bay off Jersey City.
The loss of life still was problematical.
It. will not be determined definitely
until there haH been opportunity
to check up the workmen employed on
the island ami on boats moored nearby.
The detonations, which were felt In
uve niHiea, uugun wim a toiiiiiiuiiun
rapid-fire of small shells, then the
blowing up of great quantities of dynamite,
trinitoltunine and other high
explosives, followed by the bursting
of thousands of shrapnel shells which
literally showered the surrounding
country and waters for many miles
around.
Fire that started soon after the lirst
great crash which spread death and
desolation in its wake, destroyed thirteen
of the huge warehouses of the
National Storage Company on Black
Tom Island, in which were stored
merchandise valued between $12,000,000
and $15,000,000. The flames,
shooting into the clouds were reflected
against New York's "sky line" and '
towering office buildings, which only
a few moments before were shaken
to their foundations as by an earthquake.
Miles of streets in Mauhat- I
tan were strewn with broken glass
and shattered signs.
Early reportR of heavy loss of life
were lmposslbitle of verification, and
the authorities asserted the number
of death probably would be small, (
It was said that owing to the extent
of the wreckage, it might be
several days before the exact figures
could be obtained.
Three are known to be dead and at
least two more are missing. Scores
of persons were injured, some of t
them probably mortally. t

tablly and essentially inconsistent wilh i
the rights of all the citizens of the nalions
not involved in any war." It reminds
the Britah government that "cit- :
izena of the Unite<l States are entirely
within their rights in attempting to {
trade with the people or the governments
of any of the nations now at i

II
ed by Gorman desttoyers last mouth
and brought into Zeebrugge.
Captain Fraytt and the iirst officer
and the first engineer of the Brussels
received from the British Admiralty
gold watches for "bravo con- ' 1
duct" and were mentioned in the !
House of Commons.
The submarine F-33 according to :
tho official account of the trial had
signalled to the British steamer to
show her tlag und to stop hut Cuptain
Fraytt did not heed and, it is
alleged, turned at high sped toward
