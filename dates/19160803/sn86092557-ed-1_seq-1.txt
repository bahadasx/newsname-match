NORFOLK, Vu., Aug. 3.?The Ger

land pascd quietly out of the Virginia
Capes at 8:30 o'clock last night on her
homeward voyage apparently unob
served by the Allied warship patient
ly waiting outsido the three-mile limit.
She was accompanied to the capes
only by the tug Thomas F. Timmins,
which had convoyed her down the
bay from Baltimore and by a news
paper dispatch boat.
lier departuro to sea followed an
eighteen mile dash through the lower
Chesapeake bay. After proceeding
slowly most of the way down she in
creased her powor at 6:30 and reached
the capes just after dusk. None of
the Allied cruisers was visible as she
passed through. Whether she sub
merged before reaching the three-mile
limit is unknown.. The two accom
panying boats only know that she dis
appeared unharmed^ and that ^to all
appearance she hWTa clearRelOWcntT
to a point where she could completely
submerge In safety.
Half an hour after the last light of
the Deutschland had disappeared, the
Timmins seemingly satisfied with her
work, turned back and headed up
Chesapeake bay in the direction of
Baltlmoro. During part of the day the
Doutschlaml had remained hidden at
a cov0 up Chosapeake bay. For sev
eral hours before the beginning of her
final dash she lay In a secluded re
troat near Langler Island, about fifty
miles above Cape Henry.

ID III CATHOLIC FAITH
Irish Men and Women Pray
As Prison Bell Announc
es the End.
LONDON, Aug. 3.?Roger Casement,
former British knight, was hanged at
nine o'clock in Pentonville Jail for
high treason.
He was convicted of conspiring to
causo an armed revolt in Ireland and
with having brought German aid to
that end. Three hours before the ex
ecution a crowd of men, women and
children gathered before the prison
gate. Twenty minutes before Case
ment mounted the scaffold the prison
bell commenced to toll. The sound
was greeted with cheers from the
crowd mingled with some groans. At
nine o'clock tho crowd had swelled
to such proportions that it extended
for two blocks from the prison front.
At one minute after nine a single
stroke of the big bell announced that
the trap had been Bprung. It was the
signal for a jeering mocking yell from
the crowd which died away into dead
silence.
Casement met his death with calm
courage. Early in the morning two
priests of the Roman Catholic church
administered the last rites in the cell
and shortly afterward a little proces
sion headed by the clergymen with
Casement following a warder on either
sldo, proceeded toward the execution
shed only five yards away. The priests
recited tho litany of the dying Case
ment responding In low tones, "Lord.
havo mercy on my soul."
As the party reached the shed whero
the gallows was erected the special
executioner, a hair dresser named Ellis
approached Casement and quickly pin
oned him. Tho two chaplains, the Un
der Sheriff of London and the Under
Sheriff of Middlesex, then took up
their position in front of the scaffold.
Casement mounted tho gallows' steps
firmly and commended his spirit to
God as he steppod on the strap. A
moment later the lever was pulled.
An effecting incident took place ouft
sldo the prison wal's as the execution
was in progress. At the back of the
prison a llttlo distance from tho Jeer
ing crowd about the gato was a group
of about" 30 Irish men and women.
When the dull clang of the prison
bell announced that the doomed rnun
had paid the last penalty, this llttlo
group fell on thoir knees and with
bowed heads remained for some mo
ments silently praying for the repose
of the soul of their dead fellow coun
tryman.
Casement showed not the slightest
concern over his fate on the last
night. He ate well and chatted freely
and cheerily with two warders in his
condemned cell. After a hearty late
supper he divested himself for the last
time of his convict's clothes and went
to bed. He was notified that he would
bo allowed to wear his own civilian
clothes for the execution but would
not be permitted to wear a collar.
All the members of of Casement's
family were Protestants and he was
brought up in that faith, but became
a convert to Roman Catholicism with
in the last few weeks. On June 29. ho
was registered as a member of Roman
Catholic church and since that timo

Grove church near the prison, have
