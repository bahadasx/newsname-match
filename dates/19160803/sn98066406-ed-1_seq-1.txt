In August, after July sale have ceaied, and before fall merchandise is
fully displayed, one finds many odd lots of summer goods brought to the
fore for quick disposal; marked down to the limit of low price. From a
selling viewpoint the season is late.
But, from the buyers viewpointnow that's something different. Here
are two months of summer ahead and here, In this store are odd lots of
dresses, waists, skirts, dress fabrics, etc., at greater savings than even July
offered'. Better make the best of it while the month is young: even now
many items arc being rapidly closed out.
New Fall Suits
The season's first showing. Many departures from the previous mode
arc In evidence. Your leisurely Inspection will be welcomed.

Work of County Agriculturist
Cow Testing Association affairs and
ftotato spraying work have been claim
ng considerable attention lately. That
many of the people do not propose to
have their potato crop ruined with the
blight is evidenced by the numerous re
quests that are coming in for help
along this line. While the disease will
not become serious as long as the
drought continues, it is very important
to be prepared, as one rainy week
might be sutlicient to ruin the potato
fields in the county that the drought
had not already finished. There is
quite an advantage, too, in Bpraying
with Bordeaux mixture occasionally
eyeu during the dry weather, as it
tends to keep the tops green and pre
vents their drying to rapidly. Just
why this is true, no ono to my know
ledge has ever been able to satisfactor
ily explain.
Considerable time was spent last
week visiting members of the Cow
Testing Association regarding the
summer meeting and picnic next Fri
day at Alvin Ualden's, one mile north
of Capac. The Association should be
commended for deciding to hold this
meeting on a dairy farm and further
showing excellent judgment in taking
their families. They realize that mater
lal advantages are not the only thing
to be gamed from the Association and
while it was established primarily to
improve the herds of the county, it is
also proving of immense value to the
dairymen's social and intellectual in
terests as well. Each family is plan
ning to bring a well tilled basket with
good things to eat and this will be
served in pot-luck fashion at noon.
Mr. Ualden and the Association also
extend au urgent invitation to anyone
outside the organizaton,whois interest
ed in better dairying to be present.
It was very gratifying, too, to una,
while calling on the dilierent members,
that Mr. Moulton, the new tester, is
doing very careful work and giving ex
cellent satisfaction. Much of the
success of the organization depends
upon the character of the tester, and it
is encouraging to know that tne worn
so excellently started by Mr. Hale is
being continued.
During the week the following men
were visited at ineir rarms: r,. ii.
Chase and Karl Wohlberg, Fort Gra
tiot township; M. O. Hitchiugs, Geo.
Lock wood. Adolph liensch and wm.
Cook, Clyde township; George McKen
zle, Lester Cole, Edwin Fuller, Floyd
Fuller. W. 11. Dane and Angus Mcin-
tyre, liurchville township; Ralph Uab
cock, John Urown, Fdd lioyd, John
lioyd. eal Teak, George Fuller ana J.
J. Norman, Grant township.
On Thursday, the July meeting or
the Columbus-Hichmoud Farmers'
Club at the home of Mr. and Mrs. IS.
It. 11 all in Macomb County was at
tended where a talk was given on mis
cellaneous subjects, including silos, silo
tilling methods and machinery and
spraying. The holding of a meeting
iu such a busy time is a very severe
test for a farmers' club, and the fact
that about thirty members were pres
ent speaks very well for the high es
teem in which the Columbus and Rich
mond people hold their organization.

Moses Graybiel Dead
Word reached Yale Sunday of the
death of Moses Graybiel which occurr
ed very suddenly at bis home in Wash
inuton, l'a., on the evening previous.
Death was caused from the bursting of
a blood vessel in the brain. Mr. Gray
biel was 48 years or age and leaves a
widow and one son. The remains were
brought to Hay City where the funeral
was held on Wednesday afternoon. He
will be remembered by the older settlers
of Vale and Greenwood township,
li&vinff reRidnd in these Dlaccs for mauv
years. For a time he worked in W. N.
McKenna's drug btore, later going to
1'ort Huron where he followed this
business for a few years, afterwards
entering the ministry. He had been
stationed at Washington for the past
four years. For a year or more his
health had been very poor, but his
condition was not considered critical
and his death comes as a shock to his
many friends in this vicinity. David
Graybiel was at Hay City Wednesday
attending the funeral.
Auto Accident
Thos. Fox, of Elk township, met
with a serious accident on the road
near Feck Tuesday evening by being
thrown from an automobile in which
he was riding. 1 he machine was run
ning at about the rate of itf or 30 miles
an hour when a bump was struck witn
Kuch force as to throw Tom, who was
riding in the rear teat, to the ground
injuring him about the head and uoay
quite badly. Dr. Vuill was called and

"The steamer lines operating on the
Detroit river are being deprived of
much business this year because thous
ands of persons are of the opiniou that
the boats are loaded to capacity every
day of the week," said C. S. Dunlin,
general passenger agent of the Ashley
,& DuHtiu line.
"Recause our steamers, as well as
other river and lake excursion boats
are usually tilled to their passenger
allowance on Sundays, many inquiries
are made by persons who want to know
when is the- best time to take the cruise
to Put-ln-Hay and Cedar Point.
"We can assure everyone that on
Mondays and FridavB throughout the
remainder of the summer that the
steamer Put-ln-Hay will not be tilled
to one quarter of it passenger allow
ance. So society, factory or fraternal
excursion are scheduled for these days
and as a result persons who wish to go
to Lake Erie resorts and be assured
that the steamer will not be crowded
should plan to make the trip on either
Mondays or Fridays.
"Our present business on Sundays
has been unusually large, but we have
taken care of the crowds and very few
people have been unable to take the
trip because the boats were tilled to
thvir passenger allowance.
"While tne crowds are small on
Monday and Fridays, there are always
scores of vacant chairs on the decks on
the other week days and the ball room
is never crowded.
"The steamer Put-In-Uay was built
to accommodate over 3,000 persons
without crowding and our average
week day passenger list does not aver
age much over 750."

A Little Too Fresh
The pure food laws were stretched a
point in Vale during the past week, ac
cording to a story told by Fred 'lay
lor, and the factahat eggs can be "too
fresh is also shown. When Fred lock
ed up the store on Saturday night
everything seemed to be normal, but
upon his arrival at nis place oi ousi
ness Monday morning a good healthy
chirping was heard. Upon investigate
lng the matter he round a nice little
chick stirring around in one of the egg
crates. Fred took the little one out
carefully and carried It home. He
hasn't decided whether to engage in the
poultry business or keep on buying
eggs, but whicn ever he does, we it bet
a leather medal that ne win keep the
eggs in a cooler place or be more care
