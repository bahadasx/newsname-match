Big German U-Boat Eludes Allied Warships Wait

the Three-mile Limit
EIGHT WARSHIPS ARE LOOKING FOR BOAT
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 3 "With her crew lined, up on
deck and cheering for Aiucriea and its people, the
Gorman submarine Deutschland passed out to 6ca
at 8:10 o'clock last night on what may prove a voy
age of death for all on board. Thirty minutes later
-the Deutschland crossed the three-mile limit and
immediately submerged. The cruiser North Car
olina andlhc destroyers Sterctt, Flushing and lleid
were outside the Virginia capos "To see that the
Deutschland crossed the. three-mile limit without
being molested. The Sterctt was first to sight the
Deutschland and reported her crossing the three
mile limit safely.
The tug Thomas F. Timmins accompanied the
Deutschland almost to the three-mile line and Capt
ions Hinseh, himself a Gorman skipper, of note,
bade goodby to Captain Koenig of the Deutschland
as the latter commander and the crew of the under
water craft stood on the deck of the submarine.
Captain llinsch said the voyage of the Deutsch
land from Baltimore was uneventful. Two hours
before she made her dash for the sea the Deutsch
land submerged in 40 feet of water.
When the Deutschland took the plunge, outside
the Virginia capes at least one allied cruiser was
within four miles of her.
As the Deutschland approached it was apparent
she was carrying false, superstructure,' slightly low
er than her conning tower. It was straw-colored
and blended with the oilskin coats worn by her
crew, Who crowded the deck.
"When about a mile fro mthe press boat the sub
mersible began to clear away th efalse superstruc
ture and take soundings, as if preparing to dive
Just as the superstructure was clear
ed, the Timmins moved ahead of the
undersea liner and signalled that the
boats Intended to pass on the star
board side. Immediately both ves
,els .Increased their speed and put
over to the starboard.
As the Timmins fame alongside
the press boat at ax distance perhaps
of 100 feet and with the Deutschland
moving slowly close to her starboard
aide. Captain Hinsch of the German
war-bound steamer Neckar, who had
charge of the clearing of the Deutsch
land, shouted thru a megaphone,
"Who Is that?"
Upon being advised that it was a
newspaper boat, he shouted this in
formation to the Deutschland and
then both vessels puton speed, mov
ing ahead rapidly.
Sailors on the Deutschland paid no
attention to salutes from the news
paper boat. They gazed at her si
lently for a while and then began put
ting on their blue uniform coats.
The Deutschland was displaying
red and green lights set flush on the
two sides of her conning tower. As
he passed the newspaper boat she
put out these lights.
The TlmrIns then moved over to
the port aide of the channel, about
ISO feet from the Deutschland, and
they continued In these relative pos
itions foi a considerable distance
down the bay.
By this time the sun was setting
over the water in which the Deutscb
lard stood out clearly.
The Timmins carried her regular
running lights and for the next ten
miles the Deutschland could be locat
ed only by her convoy. On these ten
miles, however, the vessels had a
clear path and they might have burr
ed all their lights without endanger
ing themselves. Only one vessel, a
tramp steamer, passed them, and she
was far awn. Her attempts to sig

ROBBER KILLED MAN
IN COLD BLOOD
Held Farmer an Mlileld Iktween Self
ami Por.Hr after Robbing
Rank of 917SO
At noon Friday, July 28, a robber
entered the State Bank at Sunol,
Nebr., west of Sidney on the Union
Pacific railroad, and after tying the
cashier, C W. Smith, and locking
him in the vault, robbed the bank of
$1750 in cash. The robber, J. W.
Cornell of Denver, was captured with
his accomplice, R. O. Loukens, also
of Denver, the same afternoon by
Sheriff McDaniels of Sidney and are
now lodged In the Cheyenne county
Jail, charged with the murder of two
members of the posse killed by them.

Mrs. C. W. Smith, wife of the cash-
Alliance, whose husband Is employed
by The Famous. A large number of
varied accounts have been given in
the newspapers of the robbery. On
Wednesday Mrs. Sinithberg received
a letter from Mrs. Smith giving a
complete account of the affair es ii
actually happened. Mr. Smith bad
been In Cheyenne the day before the
I robbery attending a bankers' conven
; tion and It is their opinion that the
; robbers had not expected htm home
so soon. Mrs. Smith usually took
' his place in the bank while he whs
absent for a short time, and they
probably expected to find her there
alone.
The letter, giving the account of
the robbery, follows:
This has been one horrible experi
ence. I will begin at the very flr-t
and tell it as best I can. Have bten
trying ever since it happened to find
time for a line -but Friday all day
was excitement. Saturday morninn

Curt went to Sidney for the flowers

we went to Ira C. Paup's funeral (he
was the deaf farmer killed by tb
robbers) at Lodgepole. Then we
came right back home and went out
to Paul Vacek's funeral at 1 o'clock.

but we ust ate on.
' This morning (the letter was writ
ten Monday, July 31) other visitors
came and have just left. It is now
11 o'clock. We can't eat or sleep
since the awful tragedy. Now for
the story:
You see, Mr. Smith got home from
Cheyenne Friday morning. He felt
bo poorly that I told him to go to the
house and sleep until noon and that
I would stay in the bank. He went
home and about 11:80 o'clock I lock
ed the door and went over after the
mail. I Just had stepped In when
the clerk said, "Mrs. Smith, someone
wants Into the bank." So I hurried

Mr. Smith Just as snyone would do
He banded Mr. Smith a check and
apked him If he could do anything for
him. When Smith looked up to ask
him If he could get someone to iden
tify him he looked into the muzzle of
a gun. Before he thought he struck
the fellow in the face with his fist.
The fellow said. "Here, I don't want
to kill you,, but I'll spatter your
brains all over the wall if you don't
put up your hands and do as I say."
Cornell, for this was the-robber's
name, made Mr. Smith turn around
and rubbed the gun up his back.
Cornell closed the front door (It
locks Itself) and pulled down the
front shade. Then marched Mr.
Smith in the back room and tied his
hands back of him with rope. Then
he stuck bis dirty handkerchief in Mr.
Smith's mouth and tied a cheese cloth
across his mouth and twisted it tight
with a stick. He then tied his legs
togcth er and carried him over and
tied him to the stove leg (the stove
sits in the corner of the back room.)
Cornell then went out and cleaned
the cash drawer and silver tray and
helped himself to the currency and
silver la the bottom of the safe. He
decided that be didn't find as much
money as he had expected so he came
back and cut the rope holding Mr,
Smith to the stove and drug him into
the vault and demanded that he open
the top compartment In the safe,
thinking the gold was there. Wben
he found that It was not he said,
"Where Is the gold?" Mr. Smith,
thinking that the robber must already
