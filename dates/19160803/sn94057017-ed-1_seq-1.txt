visit with friends in the moun
tains. J. T. Blaney, who had been
feeling pretty well for some time,
had a severe attack Sunday night
induced by his chronic ailments,
and has been feeling rather poor
ly since. We hope he will be
feeling well again soon.
S. J. Hubbard has one hundred
acres of beans, and says they are
the finest he has ever had. Mr.
Hubbard was one of the "poor
homesteaders," but now he has
eight hundred acres of land and
plenty of stock. He is a hustler.
R. C. Dillon, manager of the
Bond store at Encino, was here
on business matters Tuesday. As
an evidence of the prosperity
that ha3 struck the country he
cites the fact that he has recent
ly sold a number of Cadillac au
tomobiles, as well as many of the
lower priced ones.
In mentioning the amendment to
the 320-acre homestead law last
week we omitted saying that an
entryman whose original entry is
not within theenlarged area may
file and at the same time make
application to have his land so
designated. The sume may be
done as to the additional entry.
Of course the entryman must be
the judge as to whether he can
make a showing that will cause
such application to be granted.
Also in regard to the question of
cultivation on additional entry,
that cultivation of additional en
try is required one-sixteenth
the second year and one-eighth
the third year, and that proof
cannot be made under three
years. Residence on either the
original or additional must be the
same as under tne tnree-year
law. Some people think that
"this amendment when considered
in connection with the entire
law, may permit proof without
cultivation on the additional
where cultivation on the original
is sufficient for proof on 320. We
do not knw as to that, but as
above stated the language of the
circular issued by the general
land office is perfectly clear and
explicit in requiring cultivationon
the additional entry. One thing
which seems wholly unjust in
this amendment is that it appar
ently bars entrymen who have
not submitted final proof on their
original entries. We can see no
reason for such discrimination.
Mrs. Ben Young has been on
the sick list for the past week.

me McUIintock and Jim tsirkes
had supper Sunday evening with
J. T. Blaney. in celebration of
the passing of Mr. Blaney's 79th
birthday, which fell on the pre
vious day. Mr. Blaney was
quite pleased to have the boys
remember him in this way.
Miss Hebe Whitman returned
Saturday night on the teachers'

she attended the summer school

mer's work.
Walter Pace returned from
Oklahoma Tuesday, coming by

ied by Mrs. J. W. Huffman from
Kansas, and a cousin, Roy Mc
Cartney from Oklahoma. He
says the heat in eastern Oklaho
ma is terrific, and crops are very
poor corn badly damaged, wheat
making about eight bushels to
the acre and oats twenty.
We have not been officially in
formed, but have it from other
sources that a Republican county
convention is to be held in Estan
cia August 16th, to elect dele
gates to the state convention.
The convention will be held in
Goodin's hall, the use of the
building for that purpose having
been donated. A committee
meeting was held at Manzano
last Saturday, at which action
was taken calling this conven
tion. Stella Rebekah Lodge met
Aug. 2, with several members
present. Quite a lot of business
was transacted. Among other
things plans were made for a
bazaar to be held the last Satur
day in September. All kinds of
fancy articles, plenty of cakes,
pies, salads, dressed chickens,
etc., will be on sale, so come and
buy something nice for your Sun
day dinner. After the meeting
a splendid hour was spent in so
cial friendly intercourse, and all
felt it was good to be there.
Apropos of the rain falling in
spots and streaks this summer,
a story is told of a farmer who
stopped in the road to talk to a
neighbor. He sat in the spring
seat and talked for some time,
when glancing down he found
his feet in water, and looking to
the rear discovered that it had
been raining in the back end of
his wagon until the box was full
of water.
Mrs. W. H. Ligon from west
of Mcintosh and Miss Azie Mat

visit. Mrs. Ligon reports that
there was a copious rain in the
foothills country west of Mcin
tosh Monday.
The teachers and those fitting
themselves for teachers who at
tended the normal summer school

A subscriber of the News-Herald
writing from Willard com
plains bitterly of the same sort
of work, and mentions specifical
ly a case in which he says a
stockman has made a camp at an
unoccupied house on a homestead,
where the house is used for
sleeping and lumber from the
shed used as campfire fuel- He
thinks that with the sheriff and
an assistant prosecutor located
at Willard, ranch looting ought
to be stopped in that vicinity at
least.

A Success With Chickens
In an interview with Mr. P. P. Pel-
Hssero, on his farm northwest of Estan
cia, some striking developments in Tor
rance county egg production were disclosed.
The happy combination seems to be
the mottled Ancona hen and Macaroni
wheat.
Mr Pellissero has developed his fav
orite breed from a single Betting to 60
mature nens and a large group of
chicks in the last two years.
The hens keep on the job summer
and winter with practically no rest
periods. An idea of this production
may be gained through the statement
of the owner that each hen 8 worth
$5 00 per year. At average prices this
would enter the hens in the 200 class.
With Borne of the hens periods of 21
days have passed without a single stop
and then only to repeat the schedule.
This breed while slightly heavier
than the Leghorn, has the same nerv
ous disposition. For table they excel
the Leghorn and as rustlers they seem
to have no equal. The one objection
seems to ne tnac tnev make noor Droon
hens. A high percentage of fertility is
maintained wnere desired.
Last year Mr. Pellissero offered to
exchange eggs in order to give others
a start in this breed. This liberal offer
ought to be taken advantage of for a
trial at least.
From July on the chickens are Das
tured on macaroni wheat. Two acres
were grown this year and may be said
to have made without rain. The grain
was planted in single and double rows
and was cultivated once. The writer
has thus far failed to note a better
tilled grain. The stand is uniform
Estimated yields are between 12 and 20
Dusneis.
That there is money even at current
prices in this combination there can be
little doubt.
WILLARD
HAVE YCU WEAK LUNGS?
Do colds settle on your chest or in yuur
bronchial tubes ? Do coughs hang on, or
are you subject to throat troubles?
Such troubles should have immediate
treatment with the strengthening powers
of Scott's Emulsion to guard against
consumption which so easily follows.
Scott's Emulsion contains purecod liver
oil which peculiarly strengthens the res
piratory tract and improves the quality of
the blood; the glycerine in it soothes and
heals the tender membranes of the throat.
Scott's is prescribed by the best special
ists. You can get it at any drug store.

The carrying of deadly weaoont is becoming
a menace, owing to permits being granted.
This is a great evil. In the old days at at Wil
lard no one dared to carry a deadly weapon,
for the ottioers of the law were on the lookout
for just such men. A fifty dollar Une for a few
would soon put the weapon carriers out of
businesft. That's what's needed here riant now.
This is now, and always han been, a peaceful
community ; and no man is justified in going
armed. Let us make the law respected and light
oor tights legally. If we don't like the laws let
us change them. Both sides lose when a re
sort to violence is made.
L C Hanlon who was so seriously injured by
falling from a ladder while repairing the roof
of his house, is about town again as chipper
ana clieeriul as it ne had not been
nearly killed. Talk about Irish grit, there's an
exam ole.
That reminds me that Mr. Hanlon is in the
real estate and insurant business. So if you
are interested in that way it will pay you to
have a talk with him- Mr, Hanlon is an old
timer and knows the Estancia valley from one
end to the other and across.
As I write we are having our regular July
rain, general rain I moan, all over the state,
not showers as those of a week ago. so it looks
to me. This in the fourth good farming year
this valley has had in succession.
Those people who have bean talking so big
about building seem to be very slow about get
ting started. 1 wonder If it's all a bluff after
all.
Talkiscbcp. but it takes money to build
buildings, and it's the buildings we want for
we have plenty of talk but not enough buildings.
