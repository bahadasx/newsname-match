Norfolk, Va., August 2 -The Ger
man submarine merchantman Deut
schland passed quietly out of the Vir
ginia Cape at 8:30 o'clock tonight on
her homeward voyage apparently un
observed by the allied warships pa
trol watting outside the three-mile
limit. She was accompanied to the
capes only by the tug Thomas F. Tlm
mlns, which had convoyed her down
the bay from Baltimore, and by a
newspaper dispatch boat.
Her departure to sea followed an
elghteen-mlle dash through the lower
Chesapeake Bay. After proceeding
slowly most of the way down she In
creased her power at 6:30 and reached
the capes just after dark. None of
the alHed cruisers was visible as she
passed through.
Whether she submerged before
reaching the three-mils limit Is no'
known. The two accompanying boats
only know that she disappeared tin
"harmed, and that to all appearances
she had a clear field ahead to a point
where she could completely submerge
1n safety.
Half an hour after the last night of
the Deutschland had disappeared the
Timmlns, seemingly satisfied with her
work, turned hack and headed up
Chesapeake Bay In the direction of
Baltimore.
Durlngf part of the day the Deutsch
land had remained hidden at a cove
up Chesapeake Bay. For several
hours before the beginning of final
dash she lay in a secluded retreat
near Tangier Island, about fifty miles
above Cape Henry.
The Htenmer Somerset and the gov
ernment buoy tender Ivy reported dur
ing the early afternoon that they had
pussed her at that point. The press
boat took a position near the dividing
point of Old Point and Cape Henry
channel and awaited the coming of the
under-eea vessel.
Shortly before 6 o'clock the first
sight of the craft was obtained. Ap
parently Bhe was about five miles
away and was low In the water, only
her coming tower showing. The
Tumulus was a short distance behind
and they were traveling about seven
miles an hour.
