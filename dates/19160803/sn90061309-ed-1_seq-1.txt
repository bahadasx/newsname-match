MERCHANTS PICNIC WAS A HUMMER
Thursday, July, 27th , will long
'be remembered as" the day of the
Big Picnic in Monroe City
At an early hour the crowd be
gan to gather and in spite of heat
and dust the city was filled with
people ready to enjoy themselves
They were from Missouri, they had
rend the advertisements and came
40 hear the bands, to see the pa
rade, the free shows, the baloon
ascensions, the ball game and bear
he political speeches and they
wre not disappointed in anything.
Everything was just as promised
and thousands of people were here.
A representative of the Democrat
circled through the crowd and
asked different ones what they
thought of the picnic and everyone
was pleased. Many said it exceeded
their expectations
Ttie men in charge of affairs
were live wires and the next time
Monroe City advertises a big picnic,
the town will not be able to accom
modate the crowd.
The Shelbina Band and the
Ladies Bund from Edina were with
us nd furnished most excellent
music, but second to none was our
own little bund They haven't been
organized long but they can all read
music and they certainly surprised
the people, not only in their music
but in their "make up." In fact,
tonic were so well "made up" that
their friends never did recognize
them. Their leader made such a
fail that we are publishing in this
issue some verses that have been
sent in We regret that the poet
did not give n verse to each mem-
; ber but perhaps she was like some
others, unable to tell who was who.
The parade was a surprise to all.
About thirty vehicles were in line
and the showing was a credit to
any town of this size. We would
like to tell our readers, who were
not able to he here, about each dis
play. We had our pencil and pa
per ready but soon found out they
were passing too apidly to even
really see them well, let alone write
down a discription.
! Enough to say that everyone did
, all they wild to make it a success
I and they succeeded. It is said to
be the bet display of the kind
' Monroe City hns ever had.
! Prof Cassidy, of Quincy, made
' two baloon ascensions, one ut 1O.30
! a m. and one at 6:30 p. m.
I The trained dogs and monkeys
' gave several exhibitions,
( The dancer in gorgeous costume
I was all tlmt the crowd expecteJ,
while the acrobats were artists in
their line.
It is said thdt over a thousand
attended the ball game while the
north park was well filled and dur
ing this time Main street was full
of people
After the hand concert in the
, evening the crowd went to their
! boinei, a hut, tired lot of people.
but all satisfied that they bad bad
a big day.

harder than it would have been
