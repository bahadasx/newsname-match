VACCINATE YOUR HOGS NOW
Dont Wait Until Cholera Takes
Half your Herd
It is important that farmers watch
their hogs closely at this time of the
year avoid sudden changes of feed
provide plenty cf shade and clean
water
One of the first noticeable symptoms
of hog cholera is a loss of appetite
which may be partial or the hog may
refuse to eat anything at all Gener
ally they will be found lying around in
the grass weeds or under the bedding
the sides and Hanks tucked in the
back arched the eyes inflamed und
discharging a watery pus Sometimes
the lids become glued shut When
the hog moves about it has a weak
staggering gait Fever is always pres
ent ranging from 101 to much higher
If cholera strikes the herd prompt
vaccination by the simultaneous or
double method will save 20 percent
Without vaccination 90 per cent will
die Have your hogs vaccinated now
and prevent cholera
If your hogs arc oil feed and you sue
in doubt about them phone or write
Dr McNally Government hog cholera
veterinaiian court house Carthage
who will examine your hogs free fo
charge

Eighteenth Year No V

The Primary Election
Jasper turned in the biggest primary
vote in years Republicans 101 Demo
crats 100 Socialists it There is proba
bly not another town in the country so
evenly dlv ided politically Four years
ago the vote was Hepublican 7 and
liemocrat 71 Several things in the
campaign combined to bring a big vote
itoth Hcpublicans and Democrats
having a candidate for governor living
in Jasper County and the hot cam
paign between Manlovc and Orr for
the Hepublican nomination and then
the great amount of newspaper adver
tising used in this campaign had much
to do in bringing out the vote
The Manlove and Orr forces and
friends of various county candidates
worked hard all day long and it was
by far the liveliest election day Jasper
has seen in years
Following arc the indications from
unoilieial figures in county und state
at tiic time of going to press yester
day noon
Dickey far in lead for Senator on
Hepublican ticket
Heed nominated by Democrats for
Senator
Democrats chose Gardner for Go er
nor Houee and Atkinson in elo p nice
for second place
Manlove is leading On by soon votes
and apparently has ianiedcver coun
ty in the district
Judge Perkins renominated to cir
cuit bench over Halliburton Judge
llnghtthe Republican choice
Tudlock and Jtond running close for
county attorney on Democrit ic ticket
Flanigan Hepublican had no opposi
tion
Tangner apparently slightly in lead
of Coats for sherill on Republican
ticket OH Rogers of Webb City beat
Charlie Wells of Joplin for Democratic
nomination
Charlie Ilaylett of Jasper got a nice
vote for treasuicron Democratic ticket
but Ni the present incumbent leat
him
Meredith was the Republican choice
for assessor
II O Karl of Jasper was renominat
ed for judge of the county court east
ern district
Whether McCoy laddie or Hurlbut
was nominated by the Republicans is
still in doubt
