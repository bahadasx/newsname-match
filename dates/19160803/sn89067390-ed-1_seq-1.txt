Ccmmsrcial Failures
The Press Bureau ol the Democrat
ic Nuional Committee is out in a
statement that there is one Republican
business rec rd which the Democratic
party has not been able to demolish,
and that is the total commercial failure
liabilities during the Republican years
si 1907 and 1903. This is an tximple
ol the untruthful statements b?ued by
this bureau and ol the misrepresenta
tion the voter will have to contend
with in the coming campaign.
The tut tl commercial failure liabili
ties lor the year 1907 amounted to
S197.3S5.225 00 and for the year
1903 $222,315,684 00. This latter
year had the largest amount ol failure
liibilities ol any Republican year in
history, but it has been tx:eeded by
every year oi the present Wils n ad
miuis'r.ition,
In 1913, the cnninierci; failure lia
bilities amounted to 8272,672,228 00;
in 1914, 8357,908,859 00; and in
1915, 1302,286,184 00. This Ut
year, while showing a failing i ff m li -bilitus,
showed a large increase in the
number ol failures, indicating that the
smaller business man was unable to
withstand the usual tfLet cf a Demo
ciatic administration, but thai the larg
er ones and particularly those rff.:cted
by the loreign war orders, were better
able to withstand the strain.
Individual years are not a lair illus
tration. Take ihe sixteen Repuiican
years from McKinley to Taft, and we
find that the amount of commercial
failure liabilities averaged $152,294,
024.00 a year. During the three ytars
of the Wilson administration, the
amount of these liabilities averaged
8310,955,765.00 a year. This is an
inerease ol 104 per cent over Republi
can years and shows ' Democratic
Prosperity" in all ol its splendor.
That the failures under the Wilson
administration are not unusual (or
Democratic years will be seen by the
lact that during the four years of Cleve
land's administration, the amount ol
commercial failure liabilities averaged
8229,766,410.00 a year, this being 51
per cent larger than the average for
the sixteen Republican years following
Cleveland. Taking into consideration
the smaller volume ol business under
the Cleveland administration, the record
ol commercial ruin is about on the par
with that of the Wilson administration.
Measured by every test and page of
history, Democracy spells ruin and dis
aster for our business world. Were it
not for the spotted prosperity based on
the blood and miswy of Europe,
the commercial ruin in this country
would be even worse than during the
last Democratic administration.
The biography of President Hayes
which Prof. John W. Burgess has just
published calls to mind the fact that it
it was durnig the Hayes administration
that Diaz came to power in Mexico.
"Mr. Hayes", says his biographer,
"was not more pleased with the way
Diaz came to the Presidency than was
Mr. Wilson with the supposed or as
sumed complicity of Huerta in the kil
ling of Madero, and there were the
same violations of and dangers to
American interests and the same
boundary in fractions to be dealt with.
Mr. Hayes was a practical statesman
ol refined manners and to Mexico
were vouchsafed thirty-five years ol
such peace and prosperity as it had
never before enjoyed." The reflect
ion on Mr. Wilson is none too harsh.
No wonder the cow jumped over
the moon. She heard that ex Repre
sentative A Mitchell Palmer, formerly
of the Ways and Means Committee,
who helped put milk on the free list,
had appeared before the Committee
recently and argued to put cendensed
milk on a protective basis in order to
save us from Canadian competition.
Penrose has always stood for the policy
to which Palmer w?s just recently con
verted. Hiving announced that he "cannot
swa'low Watson," William Dudley
Foulke ol Richmond ii urged to "drink
Pluto and buy a stack cf chips from
Sinator Taggart. Logansport (Ind.)

The itenerant peddler is a destroy
er of local business enterprises. He
pays no tax-s, he pays no rr.t, hires
no help, buys no clothing or lumber
or hardware, or jwelry of the local
merchant. He employs no local at
torney, patronizes no locil dentist,
contributes to no local church or fra
ternal organiztion. Because of tries'?
thing1!, we impose a license Ire uoon
him in order to force him to h-l;i piy
local governmental expenses and also
to give the local business men the pro
tection to which they are j isi'.y emit-1-d.
For the sam; reason, x. 'moose

ers who ship goods into this country.
We do not believe in a system ol
governmental revenue which maees
the home business man pay all the
taxes and then permits the foreigner
to sell his ch 'ap goods h.'n fre. We
believe in a high import t x lor two

"It yo;i want to mike this fiht on
the tariff, we will point you to the re
flection ol the fuu ice fires which are
blushing rtd against the skies" bawl
ed Collier of Mississippi, to the Re
publicans, while delivering a home
consumption speech on the seven
headed revenue nvasur which re
cently passed the House. All riht,
Mr. Collier. And the R publican
party is going to place a firm grip on
each one of your long, f;:rry e.us and
point you to the wide-furrowed war
fields of Europe blushing red with the
blood of countless thousands slain
with shot and shrapnel "made in Amer
ica," carried to the front on American
trucks and railroad cars, and fired from
American guns, the manufacture ol
which revived the furnace fires, which,
under the smothering influence of the
Democratic tariff law, were mere heaps
ol ashes before the European war broke
out. Can ynu meet that argument.
It is scarcely to be expected that
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo will
agree with anybody else as to the con
dition ol the Treasury at any particular
time, but he certainly ought to
be a' lc to agree with himsell. On
June 30, 1915, he issued a statement
saying that the excess ol ordinary ex
penditures over receipts for the fiscal
year ending on that date was 35,864
381.56. A year later he issued a
statement which included statistics for
the same period, but saying that the
excess oi disbursements for the year
ending June 30, 1915, was 842,867,
759.59. II any Democrat is in doubt
as to these conflicting statements
hiving been issued, let him write to
the Secretary of the Treasury and get
the statements for June 30, 1915 and
1916, both of which give figures for
1915, but differing as above stated.
What would Secretary McAdoo do to
a National Bank wh.se statements
covering identically the same period
o! time varied as much as that?
Representatives Fordney, Long
worth, Green, Hill, Moore, Moadcll,
Wood and many others on the Re
publican side, gave the Democrats a
good many anxious moments during
the consideration of the administration
revenue measure in the House. All
of these speakers pointed out the
ridiculousness of the Democratic posi
tion and most of them took occasion
to rub it into the Democratic leaders
for their present inconsistent attitude,
quoting from former speeches made
by these Democrats, where they ex
pressed views directly opposite to those
they upheld during the recent debate.
It was great sport for the Republicans
and correspondingly humiliating to the
Democrats,
We Reap Where Mr. Wilson Sowed
The Mexican people, in behalf ol
whose rght tr. slaughter and pillage the
president ol the United States spoke
eloquently a lew months ago hold us
in contempt. They believe that they
are our superiors in courage, in devo
tion to country, in all virtues that
appeal to men not too proud to fight.
In this lies the explanation of the
hunii:iating occurrences that have
compelled the war department to put
our en'ire mobile army in Mexico or
on the border, to strio our coast
defenses of men, ani finilly to
mobilize the national guard ol all the
states.
Tiie source ol this Mexican miscon
ception is obvious. It is universally
recogniz'd The incomprehensible
conduct ol Woodrow Wilson has de
ceived the pnpuh'.ion ol Mexico and
mule pi.fsible the perpetuation ol the
e ror tnat now threatens to involve us
in a war from which the people ol the
United States shrink in disgust, a war
tnat intelligent statecraft in the past
would have made impossible.
An informed and firm policy, rooted
in good sense would have kept our
arms out of Mexico. That policy
Wocdrow Wilson because of his in
firmities has been incapible of provid
ing, and this morning he gives notice
to the United States that his blunders
have brought a situation requiring
their correction in blood. From the
New York Sun.
Wiiscn as Peacemaker
"IVsidtnt W.hon will take advant
age rl lh' first opportunity for renew
ing his peace overtures to the Eirop
ean hellin-rents. He desires that
negotiations frr ending the war, even
though they b; preliminary, shall be
unrii r way, and himself a factor of
thein, before the N ivember elections."
j The Ivar-pean war his bet-n made
; to play mnnv a rol on this side of the
wate. In 1914 it wis us by the
D,mocra.s as a cL a for the short1,, . . ( v j.) Citi2en.
; comings cf the Unduvood tariff. In
1915 its benefits to our industries
were put forward as a false basis for
claiming the mi rits of Democratic pol
icies. In 1916 i' is now eviden', the
President hopes to utilize it as a (actor
to secure his re election.
It is frjm the Washin'on Post, a
newspaper very Itiendly to the admin-
istration, that we take the language
quoted above; and from the same jour -
nal we learn that our amhissadors in
Europe have been inn::oi n lose
no chance to put the President toward
as a peace-maker. We dnub, how
.vrr. i! the nl.n r,n ho mH, m r.
ceed. In the first plaee, the British J
government has lately caused it to be .
made known that any peace sugges
linn, from the United Pint,, ,rm-.lrl h,
nnweleomd. And. seennH! if nr
is to be made it cannot be by the toil
some process of endless note-writing
such as the specialty of this adminis
tration. The Democratic platform ol this
year does not follow its Baltimore
predecessors by incorporating a declar
ation that the pledges ol the doc -
ument are made to be observed in
office as well as to be used in seeking
votes. The reason for the ommission
is entirely clear. The promises of the
Baltimore platform were so much more
uniformly honored in the breach rather
than in the observance that the Demo
crats this year sought to duck the ob
vious and invidious and odious com
parison. However, it is of small con
sequence, because the St. Louis plat
form is not the document which will
be invoked during the next lour years.
The chart lor this country's progress
during that time was drafted at Chica
go in the Republican convention.
About a year after he became Prcsi
dert, Woodrow Wilson wrote his check
for S25 as a contribution to a charitable
institution engaged in providing relief
(or the unemployed. A picture ol the
check was given to the press to show
President Wilson's generosity. But
that check is today ample evidence
ol the seriotisess of the enemployment
problem resulting from the enactment
oi the Underwood tariff law.
The President couldn't even sign
the rural credits bill without making a
speech and in this or.e he told how
his heart had ached for the (jrmcr who
found it so hard to borrow money.
Therefore the Piesident has signed a
bill which compels the borrowing far
mer first to buy some stock in a rural
association, then to limit the amount
of money he wants to borrow, then to
confine the use ol his borrowed money
to a lew objects, and then to take a
lonj number of years in paying off the
debt no matter how much he may ac
cumulate meantime.
Whenever you see a Demccatic
newspaper publishing satistics showing
hov much better business is in any
line at the present time as compared
with 1st year or as compared with 1914,
sit down imtnediatly and write him a
letter asking him to publish compara
tive satistics showing busit.es3 condi
tions under the Democratic tariff law,
before the war began, as compared
with the corresponding period under
the Republican tariff law. You may
not get the editor to publish the satis
tics but you will give him something
to feel ashamed of.
Democratic newspapers telling us
that our trade balance in 1916 is enor
mously greater than 1912. True, but
do not our Democratic friends point to
the trode balance during the period the
Underwood law was in effect prior to
the outbreak of the European war?
That is the only period with which to
make a fair comparison. Everybody
kouws i ur present trade is abnormal
and doe to the war.
Mr. Hughes will be elected and we
trust the control of the legislative
branch of the government will at the
same time pass from the hands that
have made so complete a lailure in
every department ol ol National affairs
except the securing of offices and in
creasinz expenses of administration.
In preparation (or a possible war
with Mexico, the government has
purchased a long line of commodities
wiiich the publicity agents ol the Wil-
j son admii Ltration hr.ve been denying
J the title of "war orders" wheu sold to
( Europe. Blankets, for instance, are
Jnot "munitions of war" when swelling
our export trade, but they suddenly be
1 ci.me munitions when we need them
, for our own soldiers on their way to
