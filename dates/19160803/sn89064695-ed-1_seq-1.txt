Cannot Keep Hands Offfavor
Ex-Supt. Howard who unfortu
nately for this reservation, was
recommended by Supt. Hinton to
appraise the lands of the reserva
tion that were sold by Indians who
claimed at that time to be mixed
bloods and made affidavits to that
effect, cannot keep his hands off of
the internal affairs of the Chippe
was, and continues to keep up strife
and turmoil here by his activity in
Chippewa matters. There is a well
based suspicion that he had much
to do with causing a delegation of
the warehousers at Pine Point to
4 go to Bemidji as a contesting dele
gation against the regularly elect
ed delegates from here. It is also
known that Mr. Nygren took an
active part in suddenly getting a
contesting delegation to the coun
cil. Mr. Nygren is the principal
of the Pine Point Indian school,
and it ill became him to take a con
testing delegation from Pine Point
to Bemidji upon a telephone mes
sage from here, and instruct and
pus!) them to the side with which
they should vote, in view of the
instructions of the interior depart
ment against any employe taking
sides with any faction.
To what extent Supt. Hinton
favored one faction, the faction
with which his sympathies were
well known to be before he was
'appointed as superintendent here,
we are unable testate, but we have
seen a copy of his letter to the
Indian, office at Washington in
which he reported that no council
was called, or took place here,
when the regularly elected dele
gates were elected to attend the
Bemidji council. Mr. Hinton did
not call upon the officers of the
local council of this reservation to
get their side of the story regard
ing the meeting of a council, but
evidently accepted only the state
ments of the opposition upon which
he based his report to the Indian
office.
THE TOMAHAWK has no incli
nation to criticise Mr. Hinton un
justly, but he might as well know
sooner or later that the publisher
shall insist upon fair play even
from him.
The faction upon this reservation
against which Burch Daniels and
otner officials have been opposed
to for several years, do not expect
Mr. Hinton to discriminate in favor
of their contentions, or even to
not show some inclination in favor
of the faction with which he has
be*n affiliated, but the opposite
faction, which is the majority
-faction of this reservation by far,
hope that he will not give, it to
them under the fifth rib in matters
of disputes that arise.
The progressive faction of this
reservation, the faction which is
responsible for the rapid progress
the Chippcwas of this state have
been making during the past three
or four years, are inclined to give
Mr. Hinton a fair, trial, but they
_.e sufficiently independent to call
any further inclination by govern
ment employees to favor one
faction to the attention of Secre
tary Lane in whom tbey have con
fidence will not tolerate any unfair

acts of officials, or President Wil
son, if necessary, who can re
lied upon to do what he has done
in the recent past, make changes
to straighten out matters here.
The Mille Lac Indians
Glaim Judgment Alone
The Mille Lac Chippewas, who
have been much dissatisfied with
the judgment of the Court of
Claims in the Mille Lac case in
of all the Chippewasof Min
nesota, are now Insistent upon
apppaling to the court to modify
its judgment upoD the grounds
that the lands of the Mille Lac
reservation, which had been enter
ed by whites prior to the act of
1889, were not included in the pro
visions of the act.
The Mille Lac Chippewas occu
py a peculiar position, they were
part owners of the Mississippi
Chippewa reservation under the
treaty of 1864, and part owners of
this reservation under the treaty
of 1867, and exclusive owners of
the Mi'le Lac reservation. The
government, under the treaties
referred to, agreed to remove them
to either the Chippewa reservation,
or to this reservation, and to pay
their expenses of removing, give
them rations for six months after
their removal, and to help them in
various ways. Those who removed
did receive the assistance provided
for by the treaties referred to.
The government took away the
Mille Lac reservation and opened
it to settlement contrary to its
treaties with the Chippewas of
Mille Lac, and the Court of
Claims has rendered a judgment
for only very little more than
half the value of the reservation,
or for about thirty thre^ thousand
acres, and three hundred Indians
at Mille Lac have not yet received
allotments, and very little assist
ance from the tribal fund al
though they are entitled to more
th many of the Indians are now
receiving who had no interest in
the lands from which the fund
was derived.
Persons who have no interest in
the Mille Lac suit whatever ex
cept what the Court of Claims
may admit it erroneously gave
them, are trying to have more to
say relative to the Mille Lac
judgment than the Mille Lac
Chippewas, and this has caused
the latter to consider taking steps
which may induce the Court of
Chims to modify its judgment.
Sinecure Positions Still
Kept Up
There was some discussion at the
Bemidji council regarding the sine
cure positions which are still being
kept up by the Indian office at
Washington, especially those filled
by so-calied farmers. Delegates
from several reservations had more
or less criticism to make regarding
the farmers upon their several res
ervations.
There are from fifty to seventy
five sinecure positions now being
filled in the Chippewa Indian ser
vice, yet no relief can be obtained
from the Iudian office. This is not
remarkable nor even surprising
since congress itself seems to be
unable to correct the evil.
The only hope there may be to
abolish the sinecure positions is to
present the matter again next win
ter to congress in as forcible a
light as possible.
White Earth,
In The List Of The
Annanias Club
It is due all the Chippewas of
Minnesota that there should be no
secrecy in the discussion of their
affairs truthful men should come
out open and above board. No
man with a grain of principle would
say anything about another which
he would not be willing to say
publicly, or even publish, if he
thought it to be true.
It is for this reason that the pub
lisher invites a discussion by
Henry Warren of his statements
made at Bemidji, that he dislikes
what he characterized as the me
thods of the publisher of HE TOM-
AHAWK in Indian matters. The
columns of THE TOMAHAWK are
open to him for this purpose It
is honorable for a man to tell an
other where his faults are in taking
part in public or tribal matters,
but extremely dishonorable to ap
proach a government official and
make untruthful statements to in
jure or discredit an opponent.
At Bemidji, during the meeting
of the General Council there,
Henry Warren stated to Indian
Inspector Knight that the publish
er is partial to Keewatin Acidemy
because the latter's son was edu
cated there and obligations had
been incurred for him. The truth
of this statement was challenged
in open council by the publisher,
but Mr. Warren did not have the
manhood to make any statement
regarding^hat, he said to the in
spector.
If the fact that the publisher en
dorsed the actions of the school
board which consisted then of Eu
gene J. Warren, ArchieLibby and
C. 11. Beau lieu as a board by in
forming the president of the acade
my that the board had been duly
elected, and that the publisher
would vouch for its actions in the
approval of the tuition, board and
other expenses of Delancy Davis,
a nephew of Henry and Eugene
Warren, amounting to several hun
dred dollars which has not yet been
paid, is an obligation of the pub
lisher then he must admit it is true.
But it comes with very poor
grace from Henry Warren to try
and create prejudices by making
misrepresentatioi'S to an inspector
to prejudice him since the matter
is one for which he himself should
be under obligations to the acade
my instead of the publisher.
The Chippewasof Minnesota are
too well acquainted with the efforts
that have been made to pay the
tuition of the members of practi
cally only one family at schools
for the higher education of Indian
boys, for this was fully and open
ly discussed by THE TOMAHAWK
three years ago, and as this family
had incurred obligations at the
Keewaun Academy, it endeaMre
to wipe out these obligations by
criticising the school. This was
done as l,\te as last winter when
young Peter Jourdan appeared in
his own and on behalf of other
mixed-blood Indian boys that were
attending the academy, and suc
ceeded, with the help of the Chip
pewa delegation, in getting an ap
propriation so that he and his com
panions could continue their stud
ies the school.
The Mille Lacs Object
AJ the time approaches for the
final settlement of the Mille Lac
ca.se, the Mille Lac Chippewas are
objecting most strenuously to the
amount of the judgment being paid
to alf the Chippewas of Minnesota.
There is more or less basis for
wy*'
THE TOMAHAWK
'Truth before Favor."
mpwm ww*
the ohjections of the Mille Lac
Indians to dividing the judgment
wiih the other Chippewas of Min
nesota, especially as the land* of
their reservation were taken by
settlers prior to the passage of th
Act of 1S89, and that act only con
firmed the entries as- the decision
of the Court of Claims shows.
The treaty between the Missis
sippi Chippewas and the United
States in 1S64 gives the Mille Lac
lfppewas the exclusive right to
the Mille Lac reservation, and an
equal right with the other Missis
sippi bands to the Mississippi res
ervation near Cass Lake, and like
wise an equal right with those
bands to the White Earth reser
vation, but it does not give the
bands any right to the Mille Lac
reservation.
The attorneys for the Mille Lac
band have always maintained that
if the matter was put up to the
Court of Claims, it would modify
its judgment so as to apply to the
Mille Lac bands alone. The Mille
Lac Indians have been very insist
anjfc since last year that this should
be done, and this will probably be
the final outcome.
All Object
Objections are made by the mem
bers of the Chippewa delegation,
that went to Washington last win
ter and got an appropriation of
$10,000 for making improvements
u,pon the Chippewa reservations,
such as building roads, etc., and
Ukt*7is% others, against the em
ployment of any but Indians to do
the work even as overseers.
*WMW0MIM*MMiaM)MW*MmmMM
There are members
vation who can fill all the positions
and they will insist upon this even
to the extent of invoking the courts
to have the law passed under the
last Indian appropriation act ful
filled.
Bitter complaints are being made
against Mr. Du amort, who is issue
clerk, and who usually assumes
charge over all the work of agency
here for importing employees al
though members of the tribe are
competent and anxious to do the
work. Mr. Dummert requires res
ervation people to do the work
done here for the agency for a very
little more than he pays imported
helo although the latter do not do
any better or faster work than
local men whose money is paying
for it.

It is of some interest among the
ChippewHS of this reservation to
know who is paying the salary of
John K. Howard for loafing around
here or at Detroit, and whether it
is the government or the Chippe
was that is paying this salary. If
it is the Chippewas, it would be to
their interest to learn from Wash

at their expense to continue to stir
up trouble and turmoil.
