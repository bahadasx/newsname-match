CRITTENDEN CO.,
INSTITUTE, 1910.

laUreiting and Profitable
Week Ended Sat.
The Crittenenden County In
Btiutf convened Monday morn
ing. July 24th, with Instructor
T. C. Cherry in the chair. In
the absence of. Rev. Chandler,
opening exercises were conduct
ed by Rev. Rufus Robertson.
Then Supt, Travis took charge,
asking for nominations for presi
dent, vice president and secre
taries. Frof. V. L Christian
and Geo. V. Conditt were chosen
president and vice president re
spectively. Mrs. Fred Hulyard
and Miss Iva Hicklin were elect
ed secretaries.
After an opening address by
I'rof. Travis, the president took
the cha-o calling for an address
ty Instructor Cherry wherein he
suggested that team work is the
ltt work, and brings us togeth
er both mentally and spiritually,
a well as physically. We all
have a separate and distinct work
to do, hence we cannot afford to
I nti-ent from even one session
(.f this week's work. Impres
icrs of us are obtained from our
en idea of its meaning, often for
getting that fathers, mothers and
teachers, in their labors for the
children, providing them with
sufficient food and clothing
and instilling into their minds
ideas of civil and religious train
ing, are, indeed, no less a pa
triot than the soldier who fights
on the field.
The afternoon session was call
ed together by the singing of
"America," then after a few re
marks by President V. L. Chris
tian, the topic, "The First Day
of School," was splendidly dis
cussed by Fred II. Hillyard, in
which he thinks the first day nf
school to be the most important
day, there being a great many
things to be done, as well as a
great many things to be left un
done at that time. It being al
together unnecessary to take up
the time in an opening speech,
but to have the program planned
beforehand. Go into the school
room at once, show himself to be
mister of the situation and goto
work. t

in motion.
Frof. Cherry uses tbe child as
his central theme, tajirg the1
last erf of civilization is the
chi i tr.d the efforts tf the school,
trader. Uoks, building, all look
to the frtedom of the child, a
freedom from that benighted
cot dition which will not allow
the child to develop. The whole
aim of life is freedom, yet -the
human race has for ages teen en
thralled in bondage of mind.
Two forces are r.ow at work to
ward the freedom of the child:
One, the humanitarian who looks
into the child and fees the good
inside; the other, science, which
led s down into the mind cells of
the child and fmda that most cell
matter is alike both in animal and
plant The child is so organized
that r.o part can be affected with
out affecting the whole being.
He is an organism so united as
to form a complex whole, there
fore must I studied from a sci
entific standpoint, hence the best
teacher must be a student of bi
ology.
The child stards between two
vistas, the rem'cte past and the
pregnant future, heredity and
environment. Now the business
of the educator it to introduce
the child into its big world, for
the child becomes a part of a!
he meets, thus the period of
plasticity is an index to all he
will become.
The subject Civic Training and
I'Btriotism was ably and eloquent
ly handled by Mr. A. C. Moore,
who thinks that civic training
pre pares one to meet every phase
of life, teaching us to obey the
Golden Rule, therefor regarding
the rights of others as paramount
to our own.
Observation shows that while
. education advances, crime de
creases, hence the effect of civic
training in our public schools
serves to eradicate crime and do
away with so many cases in court

The prevailing school of think
ing on the rural problem, com
monly expressed in recent books,
magazines and newspapers,
sounds the slogan, "Keep the
boy on the farm." There goes
with this cry the demand that
the farm home shall be brighter,
country schools shall be redirect
ed toward the farm, business
shall be co-operative, religion
shall be social. Give the pupils
something they can carry home
and apply to their everyday
work. Make the home pleasant
