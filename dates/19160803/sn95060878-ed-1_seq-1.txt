Though the unexpected
often happens in the business
world as- elsewhere, Yuma,
commercially, as a whole, re
ceived a considerable jolt
when it was made known by
Frank Blaisdell that the
Yuma Electric and Water Co.
the Yuma Water and
Light Co. had transferred
the right, title and interest j
which has been theirs for ai
a century to the
Los Angeles Title Insurance
Trust company, the change of
owners taking place today.

to make changes looking to

that we want them to pay for our
project. '
In the article referred to they were
plainly told that Yuma project land
owners had no such idea.
The truth, of the whole matter is
If the new weather man doesn't
hurry up and bring about "normal"
weather, the people will begin to think
that he intends to dish out weather of
the Philadelphia type all the time. It
is all right to give us a taste of that
kind of weather once in a while; but
to keep it up begins to work on one's
nerves. Come, Mr. Lodholz, and give
us our good old Yuma summer-time
weather. We like you, all right; but,
we don't like the kind of weather you
brought here from the East.

No one knows the ups and downs
of the old company better than Supt.
Sam de Corse, who was born and
raised in Yuma and has been in the
employ of the Blaisdell company (of
which Hiram Blaisdell is president)
all his life working up from the bot
tom to the position of superintendent.
No man could have accomplished
more with the equipment and means
at his command, and his faithfulness
to the interests of his companj' and
the welfare of Yuma has never been
questioned. But, lacking capital with
which to advance, Superintendent De
Corse worked against great odds and,
since the flood of last January which
seriously crippled the power plant, it
has gradually developed that a change
was almost a necessity to secure for
Yuma the service which a rapidly
growing city demands.
