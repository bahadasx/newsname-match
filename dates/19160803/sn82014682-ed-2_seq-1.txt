was launched. During this time, ac
cording to the enemy's, announce
ments beforehand, the decision - had
to be obtained under all circumstances
by the Entente Powers. ? vii ,
On a 28-kilometer front the enemy
advanced four kilometers on an aver
age, but after the experiences of July
20, 22 and 24, as well as those of July
30, they cannot affirm that the German
line was even shaken at any place. :
. This "success cost the British at
least 230,000 men, according to very
conservative estimates. For the French
losses there is no basis, for accurate
estimate but since the French had
to do the biggest part of the job,
and even . taking into consideration
their superior fighting, still the total
enemy, losses will reach 350,000. .. '

LONDON. Eng., Aug. 3. One of .the biggest air-raids of thv
war was. carried out by the Germans hi the early morning hours today,,
when a fleet of six Zeppelins, presumably accompanied by a. large mim
'er of aeroplanes; stole over the eastern counties of England in the dark
ness and dropped bombs at a number of widely-separated points. :
Up to. the present time 80 bombs are known to have been dropped,,
but the only effect so far reported is the killing of nine horses. Most
of the bombs are said to have dropped and exploded without much ;
damage. ; ' t V . . : x'r - xx';'Xx.J. x't- ', ; ;
, One of the Zeppelins, caught in the air by a shaft of h'ght from a
searchlight, - was immediately fired on by ' anti-aircraft guns. It was
thought at the time that this Zeppelin was crippled by the explosives ,
shot from below; and the report was confirmed by a despatch from -Ymuidcn,
Holland, which says that as Zeppelin was sighted today off
the Dutch coast 'with'a heavy h'st. flying as if-'damagfed. " T -.. -..
