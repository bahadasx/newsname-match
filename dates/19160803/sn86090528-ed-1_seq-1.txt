Held Bible Class.
Those who entered the mayor's of
fice at one particular hour ye.;cerday
might, have come to the conclu
sion that a Bible Class was pursuing
its weekly labors, with disappointed
candidates as members. It happened
that several of those who "also ran"
had. congregated at the city hall to get
final returns from belated boxes when
His Honor was seized with a happy
thought.
"Say. ;-oa fellows," said Mayor Coff-
nui'i tryiiifi to console the disconsolate
oik s, 'heres no use of all of you go
ing around here moping all day long.
There's the New Testament. Each of
in sit down and read a verse out i.f
it. It will do you good."
At:d then began a biblical pursuit
wii'ih interested the group for a quar
ti'i o.' an hour. Jim Dillon lead off
with a verse which gave him cheer,
lint it was nothing compared with the
etse which fell to Swan, which, in
terpreted by the young assistant attor
ney, snowed hira clearly that it was
hid Christian duty to try again.
Dews also found food for reflection
'ii his allotment of Scripture but Jude
Vance suffered from a violation of tlio
rule. The men had been asked to
reiiU only a single verses Vance, r.l
tho;!i tlx votes ahead of Moore in
the last report which he had received
in the race for justice, of the peace,
rend the Bible for luck but instead cf
one rse he read an entire chapter.
T'te v'oiution of this point of etique'ie
cost him dearly for scarcely had ho
completed the concluding lines ween
he learned that Judge Moe-e's vole
lift. I advanced to a place which placed
h'm in the lead by ,.ti votes.
Put it was a merry time which fol

Noted Irish Leader Shows No Signs of;

Reprieve Till Last Night
By United Presa.
London, August 3. Sir Roger Case
ment, who was convicted of treason in
connection with recent Irish revolts,
was hanged at Penionville prison at 9
o'clock this morning and was cut down
ten minutes later.
"I die for ny enmity," were the
Irish leader's last words.
Only a few officials witnessed the
hanging but a large crowd waited out

announcing the law's satisfaction a
few cheers were heard intermixed with
groans.
Several Irish women attempted a
demonstration but were driven away
by guards.
Sir Roger went calmly to bis death.

appeared to be slightly nervous when
he left bis cell but there were no

THREATENS
TO TIE UP
ALLROADS
President Wilson Asks for, Conference
With National ' Fixer" in Order
to Prevent Huge Strike
By United JPress.
Washington). August 3. President
Wilson today asked for a conference
with Commissioner Chambers of the
federal board of mediation and concil
iation, presumably to discuss the
threatened strike of the four big broth
erhoods of railroad men which would
cause a nation-wide tie-up of transpor
tation. Trainmen say they will not arbi
trate and the railroads refuse to yield.
Should the president demand arbitra
tion he would face the resentment of
several hundred thousand laboring
men. If he fails to bring about arm-
tration he will face aparalyzed trans
portation system, resulting in tremen
dous business confusion and suffering.
Administration officials and repre
sentatives of railroads and labor are
pessimistic, over a possible agreement
being reached when the brotherh oods
committee and railroad officials re-
smme their conference in New i oik

TATE WARNED NOT
TO MEET HEMPEL
According to the latest reports from
fighting fans Texas Tate is not believ
ed by his friends to be equal to the
task of defeating Hcnipel at Ardmore
tomorrow night. ,
On this subject the Daily Oklaho-
man says:
"In signing to meet Jack Ilemple at
Ardmore next Friday night, Texas
Tate refused to take the advice of
friends, experienced in the boxing
game; who urged hint to get more ex
perience before tackling Jess Willard's
former sparring partner, s
"Tate showed in bis mill at Chli ka
sha a few days ago that he is at a
great disadvantage when opposed by
a man with superior ring experience.
He has an uppercut that will ruin Hem
pie if it lands often enough, but it is
a question whether he can get through
the defense of a man who spent sev
eral mouths blocking the npper'iits of
the world's champion.
"A few days before Tate met Flynn
it was announced that he would take
on Hemple at Wirt July IS and when
a slight injury to his arm in the Flynn
bout caused the postponement ot the
date, Jimmy Kelley and other friends
advised the Chickasha man to set the
match back far enough that he could
improve his work. K;dent!y Tate
came to the conclusion that he could
ttike care ot himself, for within a day
or two came the announcement that he
would meet the easterner this week."
