|J. S. Takes Precautions to
Make Certain of Ship's
Safety in Leaving
Fortress Monroe, Va., Aug. 2.
Eighteen hours after the German mer
chant submarine Deutschland sailed
from Baltimore, she had not been
sighted from the. Virginia capes or in
•Hampton Roads and nothing bad been
beard from bcr sine© 6130 o'clock tbij
jnorning when she was reported on
(Tangier Sound, about sixty miles up
/Chesapeake bay.
Although last night she was making
•sixteen knots, she apparently has been
[proceeding since at much slower
Upeed. On the trip up the bay after
her arrival off the capes only seven
teen hours was required for the run
from Hampton Roads to Baltimore.
Much surprise was occasioned here
by reports brought by passengers on
an incoming coastwise steamer that
only one allied warship was on guard
today off the capes.
LEAVE PORT BOLDLY.
Baltimore, Md., Aug. 2. —The Ger
man merchant submarine Deutschland
sailed from this port last evening for
Germany.
The sailing plans of the Deutschland
were a carefully guarded secret but
when she left Baltimore there was a
'belief that she would proceed direct to
„~Newport News. Yet there was an ex
pectation in some quarters that the
submersible would seek a quiet cove
or inlet somewhere in, lower Chesa
peake bay and there await a favorable
opportunity to make a dash through
the allies' blockade off the capes.
Captain Paul Koenig and the
Deutschland crew did not glide out of
Baltimore harbor with grim, set faces
as befitted men going to possible doom
After the first cheer and chorus of
•team whistles and motorboat horns
when the first inch of green hulk ap
peared, there was no sound but th^
chug-chug-chug of a score of boats and
the surge and wash of water as a has
tily formed and motley fleet, with the
submarine in the lead, sped toward
the Chespeake. Her captain, on the
conning tower, was as deeply absorbed
in his maps and charts as though he
were alone in, his library.
Straight astern, now far behind, was
the evening haze of Baltimore factory
chimneys and the low red sun sank in
to its bank of gold rimmed gray clouds.'
And soon the Deutschland disappeared
from view.
Bremen Now Expected.
Wo word has been heard from the
Bremen, the Deutschland's sister ship
since it left Bremerhaven, according to
Paul Q. Li. Hilken of the Eastern For
warding Co., agents of the Deutsch
land.
Purely as a guess, Mr. Hilken Baid
today, the Bremen may arrive at Balti
more any time after tomorrow. He
did not know the date on which she
left the German port, he said. He ad
mitted that preparations were going
on at the Locust Point pier just
vacated by the Deutschland to receive
another submarine. Mr. Hilken also
said his company had cargo stored in
every large port on the Atlantic sea
board.
Mr. Hilken talked concerning the
line of submarine merchantmen which
the Deutsch Ozean Rhederei builders
and owners of the Deutschland and
Bremen propose to establish between
Germany and America. One of the
submersibles will be named the Amer
ica, he said, and another the Balti
more.
NET8 TO TRAP SHIP?
Newport News, Va., Aug. 2.—Pass
•engers arriving today on an Old Do
minion liner from New York reported
that when the ship approached the
Virginia capes only one foreign W&r
ship was sighted. They told of seeing
an object lying low in the water, with
two masts visible, toward which the
foreign cruiser was heading. It look
ed like two' huge buoys with masts
above and. •some of the passengers
thought it might be supporting a net.
It lay just outside the three mile lim
it where the channel is narrow.
AEROPLANES ON LOOKOUT.
Newport News, Va., Aug. 2.—Two
aeroplanes were seen flying over low
er Chesapeake bay at Hampton roads
shortly after daybreak this morning.
They were not from the Atlantic
coast aeronautical station here. It is
believed they came from the armored
cruiser North Carolina on neutrality
patrol off the Virginia capes. The ma
chines maneuvered back and forth
over the water at & moderate altitude.

AFTER BANDITS
QUICK ACTION TAKEN TO HEAD
OFF BAND REPORTED AS
HAVING CR08SED LINE.
El Paso, Tex., Aug. 2.—Two troops
of the Eight cavalry under command
of Capt. William Kelley, Jr., are
scouring the gulches and canyons be
tween Finlay, Tex., and Ft. Hancock,
about seventy mileB east of here in
search of bandits.
The cavalry is supported by a bat
talion of the twenty-third infantry
rushed from El Paso to Ft. Hancock
early this morning in response to re
ports to General George Bell, Jr., com
manding the El Paso military district
that bandits in large numbers had
crossed the Rio Grande in that vicin
ity.
First reports to General Bell from
the cavalry column said three hours'
search of the hills disclosed no trace
of bandits{
The infantry, transported in motor
trucks, is being held at Ft. Hancock
together with a motorcycle squad also
sent from El Paso to reinforce the
cavalry, should the trail be picked up.
Reports to General Bell estimated
the number of bandits variously from
50 to 175.
No Sign of Bandits.
A thorough search of the territory
between Finlay and Fort Hancock fail
ed to disclose Mexican bandits, later
reports to General Bell stated.
The report was from Captain Wil
liam Kelley Jr., In command of the
two troops of the Eighth cavalry, sent
from El Paso. A similar report was
received from 'Top" Allison, civilian
scout of Sierra Blanca, who stated
that he had combed the hills.
Reports of the presence of bandits
were received shortly after midnight
from Sergeant Harry F. Smith, com
manding an outpost of the Eighth
Massachusetts infantry east of Fort
Hancock. Smith said his men had
watched the party cross the Rio
Grande.
MEXICANS FILE APPEALS.
Laredo, Tex., Aug. 2.—Motion

ed of murder In connection with the
bandit raid at San Ygnacio, Texas,
June. 16, in which an American soldier
was killed, was denied here today.

and Paulino Sanchez announced appeal
would be taken to higher courts.
GERMANY HEEDS
HOLLAND'STHREAT
PROMISE IS MADE THAT SUBMA
RINE WILL NOT ATTACK
DUTCH FOOD SHIP.
London, Aug. 2.—The German gov
ernment has sent a pledge to Holland
not to destroy or molest Dutch ships
carrying foodstuffs to England, says a
Copenhagen dispatch to the Express.
This decision is the result of a visit
to Berlin of Cornelius J. K. Van Aalst,
president of the Overseas Trust Co.,
and another Dutch commissioner.
The Express says Van Aalst pre
sented an ultimatum to the authorities
in Berlin to the following effect:
"Unless Germany agrees not to in
terfere with Dutch ships bound for
England with food cargoes Holland
will close her eastern frontier. Other
wise the entente may stop Dutch im
ports from America and the Dutch col
onies."
The trip of the Dutch commissioner
was the result of representations by
the entente that Holland was selling
large quantities of foodstuffs In Ger
many while her food trade with Eng
land had almost ceased. Holland re
plied that trade with England was
made dangerous by German subma
rines. Van Aalst, fearing reprisals by
the entente, then undertook the trip to
Berlin.

DEMON
Plaintiff inEddyville
Case Wants Few Days

COUNTY ENGINEER
GOES OVER ROADWAY
Files Affidavit That He
Finds Cemetery Hill
in This District
Affidavits, filed in the district court
Tuesday afternoon in support of the
claim that Eddyvllle officials were
acting within their jurisdiction when
they paved Cemetery Hill, brought
forth a motion today to continue the
application for dissolving an injunc
tion against the town. Judge Cornell
granted the motion and set the case
up until Friday morning at 9 o'clock.
The application to dissolve the in
junction was set for hearing this
morning and for an hour attorneys
argued for and against continuing the
case. When J. W. Odem filed the peti
tion against the city officials, claiming
that they had been acting over and
above their authority, Judge Cornell
granted the temporary injunction im
mediately.
Soon after this the officers of the
town filed an application asking that
the Injunction be dissolved. They
claimed that the court's restraining
order virtually stopped all activities
along municipal improvement lines and
ran Jhe risk of closing down the power
and light plant, which presented the
possibility of the town being left in
darkness some night.
In the original petition for the in
junction to restrain the officials from
completing work on Cemetery Hill the
plaintiff claimed that the town was act
ing without authority because the road
way was outside of the city limits and
that unnecessary expenses were being
incurred. In the affidavits filed Tues
day it is stated by County Engineer
Cook that he has made a survey of the
work and that It is being done within
Wapello county by several feet. Other
statements from George L. Gillies of
this city, a former resident of Eddy
vllle and Mayor S. H. Lames of that
city, show that they have gone over
the work, have inspected the city plats
and find that the claims for an injunc
tion are without foundation.
Mr. Odem's attorneys argued before
Judge Cornell today for an extension
of time to give them an opportunity to
have a surveyor go over the work and
see If the statements, set out in the
city officials' affidavits, are true.

WILSON RECLINES
TO FOLLOW LEAO
OFJUDCEHUGHES
ANNOUNCES HIMSELF IN FAVOR
OF SUFFRAGE BUT ONLY BY
ACTION OF STATES.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 2. —Presi
dent WllBon has not changed his posi
tion that the woman suffrage question
should be dealt with by the states* it
was announced today at the white
house. The statement was brought
forth by the announcement yesterday
of Charles E. Hughes, the republican
nominee that he favored an amend
ment to the federal constitution giving
the rote to women.
A delegation of suffragists saw the
president yesterday and afterward In

new statement on the question before
the convention of the National Ameri
can Woman Suffrage association in
September. At that time the policy
to be pursued In the presidential cam
paign will be determined by the na
tianol suffrage organization.
Today Secretary Tumulty discussed
the question with the president and
afterward announced that Mr. Wilson's
position on the subject was unchanged.
This position, as outlined several times
to suffragist delegations, within the
last three years, is that while he fav
ors votes for women, he is opposed to
federal action.
The president voted for woman's
suffrage in New Jersey last year. It
was Indicated that today's announce
ment was final.

FOREIGN TRADE
GROWS IN YEAR
REC0RD8 FOR THE YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, INDICATE EXTENT
OF U. S. MARKET3.
Washington, Aug. 2. Merohant
shipping cleared from ports of the
United States in the year ending June
80, set a new record, notwithstanding
the allied blockade, the closing of the
Black sea and the withdrawal of Ger
man and Austrian merchant ships from
trade. Bureau of navigation reports
made public today show the tonnage
cleared was 25,500,000, of which 2,500
000 originated in the United States and
23,000,000 was foreign. The previous
high water mark was 24,800,000 tons
cleared in the year ending June 30,
1914.
Comparing the two years, American
shipping tripled and European clear
ances decreased. The Amerloan ton
nage to South America was 950,000,
nearly five times greater and to
Europe 1,100,000, two and a half times
greater. Total clearances to France
and Italy almost doubled clearances
to Norway, Denmark and Sweden
more than doubled and to Greece in
creased three fold.
The increase in clearances of Amer
loan shipping to South American coun
tries is most notable for Argentina,
whose tonnage in 1914 was less than
5,000 and in 1916, 190,000 and for Co
lombia which got 285 tons of American
products in 1914 and 100,000 tons in
1016. Clearings to Brasil were foiir
times greater and to Chile five times.
China got 5,000 tons of Amerioan
goods in 1915 and 87,000 In 1916 for
Japan there was a decrease from 66
000 to 13,000. Importations from
Europe cleared from American ports
for China were one-half as much In
1916 as In 1914 and for Japan about
seven-tenths.
CUBAN TRADE IS

The island is declared to be in the
most prosperous condition of its his
tory. Trade between the United
States and the Dominican republic has
more than doubled within two years.
The United States took about eighty
per cent of the republic's exports last
year and furnished about the same
