tucky river. Farmers say that havoc
has been plajed with fishing tackle, and
that country people along the stream
are considerably alarmed over the sea
tiger. More rational people contend
that the "shark" was nothing more
than an unusually large gar that was
causing all the excitement. Gars sev
eral feet in leugth have been crught at
different times in Kentucky river, and
it is believed that it was one of these
long nosed individuals that was mistak

BACON. GO SEE THEM.
Interesting talks are given by the
ditferent teachers on tome phase of
their worK, and round table discussions
are held every day where all problems
of the school are studied. Many visit
ors have been in attendance among
them. Miss Jessie 0. Yancey, Super
intendent of Mason County Schools,
who spoke on the State Tuberculosis
Commission and urged the employment
of a County nurse, to look after the
cases of Tuberculosis in the county.
Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Canfield,
1'resident of Central University, ad
dressed the teachers and a number of
others at the School Auditorium. In
a masterful address he brought out the
fact that the mission of the teacher
was of the highest value, for it was in
the school that the youth were prepared
for active citizenship. "I believe in
preparedness of the nation", he said,
"to withstand attacks from a foreign
foe, but no great nation was ever de
feated by an enemy until it had decayed
internally". He sounded a warning
note to Americans and asserted that
the curse of the Nation and the State
was the placing of power in the hands
of politicians rather than statesmen.
