COAL RATES ADVANCED

iilvaitee was Kanetion(.,j J,y the
iuti-rstate C-ommer'e .'orniuiss'uiii.
after an investigation of the
'matter .some months ago.
The Avhole matter, tis consider
ed by the ominission, hinged
ujM.n ih,. ipicstion whether or not
there was river e- MiLju-tition at
Hiekman. Fn fort untely for ns,
lliekm.iu was not n-preis,'qit4'd up
on this occasion, and a reKnt of
the j)i-ieelings show that the
Commission wa.s iriformed "that
'bete had bevn no movcimcnt of
eoal ly ttater o Jlickjtian for
many years, and nJs adimittisl
that Jin actual coinjH'titive ctii-
ditionri existel," etc.
'Uie jositioji of the railroad in
this hearing Aas, to say the
least, paradoxal: iiutsimu-h nei the
eoiiipany askv.l that the old rate
jM-riiiitted t stand, while rates
1o interineliate jxints Avere ud-
vanced ; and then kmn ked ' tho
jroj.s from under their nrgu
niejit Jjy saying no river compe
tition existed here. w I nidi is the
c(iiivn!rnt to placing Hickman in
the sau tie class Avith those toAvns
of'' the river, aiul therefore forc
ing the Coniiunissioj, in order to
equalize ra.te.s, to make the ftd
vaiiee. Without river competi
tion existing, the Comnnissi-ou
could not grant a lower rate to
lirkiuan than to Fnioii City, hiK-o
il is ;i longer haul to this jt'ijit.
An effort will be made to
show .the Commission that Jlick
m.in is a competitive iut ; that
eoal is being and lias Ixt-ii shijt-N-d
iu hy bargr.s every year for
the piist ten years; thai it can
be shiipjcd aiul unloaded for n
less siiiHi than $1.00 a tim.
It is at once apparent that
this advance Avill eft'eit every
luxiyV jKne.kctbook, and is a big
item to hn-al imlustrjeS which arc
large users of ctial. Jn e;use the
rate stands, larger and better
facilities for handling river coal
will naturally follow, as this is
a sure cure for excessive rail
rates.
