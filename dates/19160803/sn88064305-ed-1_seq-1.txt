WASHINGTON PARISH
CLUB RALLY,
On Friday and Saturday, July
28 and 29, the best club rally in
the state was held at Franklinton
for the benefit of the eighty club
members of Washington Parish
who spent the two days here at
tending the lectures upon poultry
raising, cotton and corn culture,
forage crops for hogs, canning
and tomato raising, and other in.
teresting subjects along agricul
tural lines.
Prof. P. L. Guilbeau, of the
Extension Force of Baton Rouge,
stated that the club short course
held here was better than those
held in other sections of the state.
It was indeed a great pleasure to
those who had worked so earnest
ly to make this course a success
to receive such a favorable report
from those in authority, and we
feel sure that the great influence <
of these meetings upon the vari. -
ous club members will result in
more and better exhibits at our i
parish fair this.fall. The enthus- i
iasm and splendid club spirit that
was aroused during this little t
short course will be the means of I
our boys and girls doing some of a
the best club work in the state. t
When the boys and girls ar- a
rived here Friday morning, the s
very hospitable people of Frank- a
linton welcomed them with wide e
open doors and gave them free ii
entertainment during their entire t;
stay in our little city; and judg. li
ing by the pleasant smiles and t.
remarks made by the club mem. a
bers, our good town people may g
rest assured that their kindness f
was more than appreciated, as a
each boy and girl will always
have the sweetest remembrances
of their visit while here among
us.
To close without saying some
thing about how very kind the
automobile owners of this town
were in taking all of the visitors
on a joy ride, would be commit
ing a great injustice to these pub
lic spirited people. This was a
sight that will always be remem
bered by both joy riders and on
lookers; as to see eighteen fine
ears spinning along our streets
and beautiful puplic roads, with
one accord-to show that every
one of them were in hearty co
operation with the great cause of
club work in our parish, and were
willing to give our visitors the
nicest time possible while they
were in our midst.
The two drug stores and other
cold drink stands in town deserve
our praise also for giving the club
members free drinks while they
were here, which within itself was
a great treat to them.
In conclusion, 1 wish to state
that our good superintendent, D.
H. Striugfield, and farm demon
strator, J. V. Rabb, did every
teing in their power to assist in
making this club short course a
strikiug success. Now, in behalf
of all the club members, I wish to
express their sentiments by say.
ing that they enjoyed the hospi
tality of the good people of our
liberal little city, and I feel that
the club work of this parish is on
a boom now and that we will have
great results from these future
farmers of Washington Parish. I
am,
Yours very truly,
J. 0. Bethea.
Heat WVave Ends at Chicago; TI

Chicago, July 31,-The end of
the longest periods of hot weather
Chicago ever experienced came
today in an 18-mile breeze from
the north. A drop of 22 degrees
from 102, the highest reached
yesterday, was recorded at 9
o'clock today, when the govern. M
ment thermometer registered 81. tc
The wind sprang up at4 o'clock tl
and gradualy increased. The it
weather burean predicted it ti
would shift to the northeast,
whence comes the usual cooling
'lake breeze." The hot spell be

the temperature was constantly

115 deaths attributed to the heat,
and more than 400 prostrations, e

The record-breaking death rate r
of the last week has seriously
tested the facilities of the coro- r
ner's office, while the prostrations
have taxed the accomodations of r
local hospitals and burdened the c
city's physioans to the limit. The
high mortality among infants has
been the most distressing phase
of the situation. Upwards of 50
babies were reported to have sue.
cumbed yesterday.
Among animals the death rate
has almost established a record.
Latest figuree show that 283
persons died in Chicago directly
or indirectly from the excess of 4

Girls' Cnaning Club work is

fully in a large number of parish
es in Louisiana, Women's Home
Demonstration work, which is the r
result of the growth of the girls' j
work, is creating much interest '
and enthusiasm in the amie par- c
ishee. The aim of this work, a
striven for in many ways is ulti. a
mately to reach the homes, to r
beautify and improve conditions f
and to help in every vital way to I
:nake life in the country more '1
liveable and to make life on the t
farm attractive to our girls. e
The Girls' Canning Clubs are a I
means of instructing the girls in 1
the cu!tivation of vegetables in a a
garden of their own and the can- iti
ning and preserving of their pro- t
ducts. The putting up of other J
produce on the farm is also j
learned and this forms a good o
foundation of supplies for the s
pantry and makes it possible to ti
introduce proper methods of cook- ti
ing and preparation of these and t]
other foods for the table. Mar- sl
keting of the girls' products is n
another important phase of the
work and teaches them business e;
ways and methods. It is re- tc
markable with how mueh interest S
the girls take up the work and h
how this interest grows to an en- tl
thusiasm which is passed on to ji
others, who, in turn, are eager to
begin the work. G
The attention of the women of
the community is soon commend
ed and we find them eager to do
work of a like nature. From this
interest Home Demonstration
Work is begun, The construction P
of many valuable labor saving a
devices for thebs home brings into h
play the ingenuity and economy c
of the housewife and impresses p
upon her how much of value can to
be made from what she already b
has without much further ex
pense. Discussions and practical n
demonstrations of foods and their n
proper combination are a few of cl
the points which we stress in our
work, n
In short, all that has to do with t
good home making is of vital in a
terest to us and is the heart of
our work. We are passing this
ipterest on to those with whom
they move and live,
Girls' Canning Club Work is
organized in 15 of the southern
d
states, and Louisiana, we are
proud to say, is one of them.
There are 18 parishes in this state V
now organized and more are
awaiting their turn to begin the
work. Washington parish, one a
of the finest in the state, has be- C
gun the work on a small scale
and we hope that the parish offi
cials will see its great value and
see fit to continue it by meeting
the offer of the state, under the t
Smith-Lever bill. Many of the t
people in the parish well know its v
merit, and to inform all is the ob
ject of this article. Let Wash
ington parish lead next year in
the state and prove its progres
sive spirit to all.

Ruston Man Finds Box Of
'1'renasuares.
Ruston, La., July 2,.--John
W. Skinner, a prominent white
farmer residing near this place,
plowed up in his field Wednesday
an old iron box, which burst when
his plow struck it. The box
contained more than a thousand
pieces of silver coin, estimated at
one thousand dollars. Most of
the coin is of Mexican mintage,
but much of it is English, Ger
man, Spanish and American
money. One piece shown your
correspondent was coined in 1777
-139 yeaas ago-of Spanish º
mintage. Mr. Skinner states 1
that he has seen the old box
around his farm many times be
fore, but on account of its great
weight, thought it a solid piece of
iron and paid no attention to it.
When his plow struck it. it flew
open, exposing the silver coins.
He brought his find to Ruston to
day and placed it in Lineolu
Parish Bank to ascertain its
value.
Accordiug to information given
out by Mexican administrative
circles at Nuevo Laredo, General
Carrauza is to retire soon and
General Pablo Gonzales be chosen
