MISSOURI MILITIA.

Kpculul lleruld Correspondent.
Laredo, Tex., July '21. Co.
"L$" slept under arms last night
with belts tilled with ammuni
tion ready for a quick call if nec
essary. One company of each of
the live regiments in camp at
Laredo is always armed at night
and day for 24 hours. The 4th
Missouri infantry is detailed for
outpost duty next week on the
Mio Grande below Laredo.
Mess halls are being built for
the boys of the 4th Regiment,
and they will be well screened
and have tables and benches.
We have a shower bath for each
battalion of men, each man tak
ing a bath once a day and some
times twice a day. Cleanliness
is appreciated, and everything is
being done for the protection of
health and comfort of the sol
diers. No person of Co. "B" is
on thi sick list and arms arc
getting well. The Missourians
are gutting as black as Mexicans
and us hard as nails.
We have just had our noon
siesta (rest) and the inevitable
sandstorm, which we are learn
ing to pay no attention to. With
all the drawbacks Camp Mis
souri in Texas is far more pleas
ant than Camp Nevada.
Lieut. Hen Hitchcock met
United States Consul Garrett of
Neuve Laredo and the Consul

deleted by the rensor) later he
odviswAmericans tostayou the
United States side of the border.
We don't need the advice, for we
know what is best, after laying
under arms all day and night.
Corp. Jou Terror left with his
sqmul composed of Privates
Cooley, Miles, Davis, Provo,
Smitli, Cecil and Kennedy for a
weak place north of Laredo,
where a guard is on the look out
at all times.
The boys are having plenty to
do, but do their part with little
argument. The camp is inspected
trom two to three times a day
and with all the drawbacks to
cleanliness here, we keep tliiugs
in lirstclass condition.
for guard on the 27th and are
still Walking their post until live
o'clock this evening, when they
will be relieved of duty by Co.
"C." The guard duty is done by
companies with one squad sent
to brigade headquarters, and
has one detachment sent to In
dian Ford. This place takes its
name from the Indians, which
was founded years ago, and is
tht only place on the Uio Grande
that can be crossed with wagons
when the water is up.
It is reported that bootlegging
is being carried on and the lT. S.
authorities arc trying in every
way to put a stop to it.
Mexican camps can be seen
from Indian Ford. We are guard
ing one mile of the river.
No one plays here. While the
drilling is not so hard on the
boys, but when one violates the
rules of cleanliness he gets extra
guard duty.
Commissary Sergeant and
Company Clerk H. K Malloure
has been the busiest man in
camp for the past lew days pre
paring the payroll.
With plenty of instructions Co.
"B" will return home as sol
diers. Two sergeants of the
regular army have been detailed
to instruct the 1st Sergeants, of
the Mess and Commissary do
partments.
Several of the boys ol the coin
pany went swimming in the Uio
Grande, going to the Mexican
bank, after returning boasting
that they had been out of the l
S. The boys of Co. "P.1' are well
pleased, with their eamp, and
grieve very little about home.
All are anxious for the mail,
which arrives twice daily.
Horned toads have been
adopted the Company's pet, and
its welfare is looked after by al
most every member. Jiaeh Cor
poral has charge of a tent and
the toad has his place, ten of
them being allotted to each tent.
Of couroo the boys do not pick
up anything lor a pet, such as
the poisoned centipedes and
tarantulas, however, some lew
are put in bottles lor sale keep

First, as Usual
Upon the call made by President Wood row Wilson for the
mobilization of the Missouri troops, the Herald was the first
newspaper in Pemiscot county to carry the first news of the
movements of Pemiscot county's contingent, after leaving its
armory. Such is always tho case with a real live newspaper
having an active correspondent In the field.
The Herald correspondent at the border ia well known in
this county and we believe is as well if not better able to
furnish the FIRST news FIRST. It's all authentic. No
guess work. He is in a position to know, thus by being a
subscriber of the Herald you get the news first hand.
He tells each week about the doings of your boy, your hus
band or your sweetheart. And all this for the benefit of
Herald readers it's service that counts. Why not sub
scribe for the Herald $1.00 per year.
