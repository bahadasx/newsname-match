ATTEMPT SOON
CLAIM WILSON WILL TAKE AC
TION FOLLOWING THE GREAT
SOMME DRIVE.
Washington, D. C., August 1.—An
other attempt at peacemaking by
President Wilson is believed to depend
on the success or failure of the pres
ent Great British and French effort on
the Somme. The information that the
president will try to step in soon
comes direct from a high official of the
German Empire at the capital. This
official, asked today to elucidate the
peace situation from a German point
of view said:
"The drive of the Allies on the Wes
tern front will continue for a week two
weeks, possibly three, and then iH
slacken up and shade off into Noth
ing doing again. Then a certain gen
tleman will step in and try to make
peace."
"That certain gentleman being
whom?"
"Woodrow Wilson."

Baltimore, Aug. 2.—The Deutschland
passed Solomon's Island, ninety miler
south at 1:30 A.' M. It was making
about 16 knots an hour. The tug
Timmins was at its side off the port
stern. Every steamer that passed
blew whistles of salute. There was no
indication as to when the submarine
would stop.
Baltimore, Md., Aug. 2.—The Ger
man submarine merchantman Deutscli
land set out today from Baltimore o.i
a return voyage to Germany with
declaration of confidence from its com
mander, Captain Paul Keonig that he
would take it home in spite of the
heavy odds it would face.
The submarine was towed out of
the slip where it was berthed twenty
three days ago, at 5:40 P. M., and is
expected to put into Newport New*.
Va., between 8 and 9 A. M., tomorrow.
Under Own Power.
After getting into midstream the
Deutschland proceeded down the Pa

tug Thomas F. Timmins went to onr.
side, the coast guard cutter Wissahic
ken to the other and a harbor police
boat followed to prevent undue crowd
ing by a small fleet of launches.
The Deutschland passed Annapo'i
at 8:45 P. M. The tug Timmins alone
was convoying and the only vessel fol
lowing was a newspaper dispatch boat.
Weather conditions were favorable.
Captain Koenig and his crew of
twenty-seven men put to sea with th*
knowledge that a man hurried to a
telephone with a message to agents of
the Entente Allies that the Deutsch
land had started. They knew how
long he had watched at the end of a
nearby pier, day and night, but the
little captain went out of Baltimore
harbor smiling and waving his cap.
His last words in the harbor were
of praise for America and for his
treatment here by Baltimore custon.s
authorities.
\Captain Koenig knows that eight
warships of the Entente Allies are
waiting for him at the edge of the
three-mile limit, spread out in a radi
us of five miles.
WHEAT SMUT CAN BE
CONTROLLED.
Every year smut injures the quality
of the wheat. Smut can be controlled
and there is little excuse for having
smutty wheat, but as long as a few
farmers in a neighborhood do not
treat the seed, the infection will be
carried from farm to farm by the
threshing machines. Like controlli »j
the Hessian fly, it is a community af
fair and all must work together.
P. H. Ross, agricultural agent of
Leavenworth County, Kan., has beer
trying to show, through the co-opera
tion of the members of the farm bu
reau, how successfully smut can be
controlled. He has just checked over
the results of this year's demonstr
tions. On two different farms small
plots were planted, one with treated
and the other with untreated seed. Oa
the untreated plots fully 25 per cent
of the wheat is affected with smut,
while on the treated plots not a single
smutty head can be found.

DODGE BROS. NEW LOCATION
E. J. Orum, who is the local dis
tributor for Dodge Bros, cars, has
leased the north half of the ground
floor in the Locke Block and the same
has been re-modeled for an auto sales
room, and Mr. Orum has moved there
thjls week. This makes a splendid lo
cation and a showy place for his line
of business. He has had a most suc
cessful sold a large number
of cars and he has placed his order ir
a large number of these popular cars
for the coming year and will no doubt
do a larger business than ever. The
Dodge has proven a most successful
popular priced car and there is a ready
sale for all this company can manu
facture.
Five changes in the postmastership
of the Devils Lake postoffice during
the past two years, and yet another
change to come, as Tuesday of this
week Mrs. J. H. Bloom was named by
President Wilson to succeed H. S. Da
vis,who has been serving as postmas
ter less than two months. Mr Davl.s
has accepted a position with the Fargo
Forum and will go to Fargo to take up
,his new duties August 15, and there
fore resigned as postmaster, and thus
Mrs. Bloom, who was at one time post
mistress for a short time, but resigned
the place after she had been rejected
by. the Senate, has again been appoint
ed,' and as a flag of truce has been run
up between Senator Gronna and Mr.
Bloom, she will no doubt be confirmed".
The many lightning changes which
has taken place relative to the post
mastership has been the cause of much
comment and bitter feeling among the
luteal
next can only be surmised.

Fargo, Aug. 1.—The North Dakota
Druggists association today adopted
resolutions calling on the postmaster
general to promulgate orders by

Henry Ford, who has made millions
since he started the manufacture
the famous Ford cars, has announced
another cut in prices, effective Aug. J.
The price of a touring car hos been cut
from $440 to $360, runabouts from
$390 to $354. If Mr. Ford can afford
to sell his touring car for $360 now,
think what he must have been making
when he sold them for $1,000 or more.

FAIRBANKS' MANAGERS SAY
INDIANA IS FOR HUGHES
Indianapolis, Ind., August 1.—The
campaign managers of Charles War
ren Fairbanks are confident that they
can carry the fall election in Indiana
for Hughes. This feeling of confid
ence comes doubly strong since the
State Progressive Convention wis
held in this city last week, when the
the remnants of the Bull Moose party
nominated a complete state ticket.
Not half of the delegates came to
the state convention and a number of
these were strongly in favor of aban
doning the plan of putting a ticket i:i
the field this fall. Incidentally, Jack
son Boyd, former state chairman, who
was a delegate, quit the party and
bolted the convention when an effort
failed on his part to have the con
vention abandon the idea of a state
ticket.
