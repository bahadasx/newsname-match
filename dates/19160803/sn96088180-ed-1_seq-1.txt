London, 'Aug. 3. Roger Casement
paid the penalty for treason today
with his life. He was hanged at Pen-
tonvllle prison at 9:07 a. m. Ten
minutes later his body was cut down,
life being pronounced, extinct. The
Irish leader's last words, spoken
while be waited fearlessly for the
drop to be sprung, were:
"I die for my country."
The Rochdale barber, Ellis, the
prison's regular executioner, sprung
the drop after he had adjusted the
hempen noose not the silken oord
which the former knlgbt hsd hoped
up to a tew weeks ago would be
granted as his Instrument of death,
In accordance with the ancient British
privilege granted men of his title.
The banging waa witnessed only
by officials of the prison. A large
crowd waited outside the grim goal
and when the bell tolled announcing
the law's satisfaction, there were a
few cheers Intermixed with , groans,
Several Irish women, standing at the
rear of the Jail, attempted a demon
stration, led by an Irish member of
parliament, but were quickly hustled
off the scene by guards.
It waa said Casement went calmly
to bis death, led by a Catholic clergy
man, who ministered to him when he

OEUTSCHLAttD SAFELY PASSES TIE
. ALLIED PATROL OFF EAST COAST
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 8. Somewhere
in the direction of Germany, safely
past the allied warships' patrol, the
German submarine freighter Deutsch
land Is boring her way through the
Atlantic toward her home port of
Bremen. Reports coming Into Hamp
ton Roads indicate the pioneer sub
marine blockade runner' has not
poked her periscope above the water
since she, submerged near the Vir
ginia capes last night. At that time
the nearest British warship was five
miles distant, according to the tug
Thomas F. Tlmmons, which accom
panied the Deutschland aa far as the
capes, i .
Expectation of a thrilling chase and
perhaps some sort of a fight In con
nection with the Deutschland'a de
parture was disappointed. Folks on
shore saw nothing and sightseers who
filled 'big and little harbor craft saw
little more.
In the dark of" the night the
Deutschland slipped out to the boun
dary edge ot the United States terrl'
torlal waters, ducked under and dis
appeared. That was all.
From Cape Henry came the word
long after sunrise that no sign had
been seen -of ,the Deutschland. A
single disappointed British dog of war
lay off Cape Henry1 light, and not an
other vesael was In" sight.
Weather conditions favor the allied
patrol, however, not the Deutsch
land. The cape obscrvef reports a
clear sky nnd only a slight brcexe.
The submarine's actual submersion
was witnessed only by her pilot tug,

Action hy Government to
: Prevent Threatened Walk
out of Railroad Employes
Forecasted fa Appointment
Washington, Aug. 3. Probability
of early government participation In
an effort to prevent the threatened
railroad strike was seen this after
noon in the naming by President Wil
son of O. W. W. Hangar to be a
member of the United States board
of mediation and conciliation, filling
a vacancy that has existed two years.
Hangar formerly was an assistant
commissioner. ,
Washington. Aug. 3. President
Wilson today requested a conference
with Commissioner Chambers of the
United States board of mediation and
conciliation, presumably to discuss
the threatened strike of the "Big
Four" brotherhoods of railway men,
which' would cause a nation-wide tle
np of. transportation. '
Washington, Aug. '3. A problem
"tremendously dangerous in both its
economic and political aspects,' faces
President Wilson In the threatened
strike of 400,000 railroad trainmen,
according to administration circles to
day. , ;
The matter Is now directly before
the president In the form of a letter
from Chairman Wheeler of the rail
way committee of the United Stales
chamber of commerce. The letter
urges an Inquiry on behalf of the ad
ministration to Investigate the Im
pending crisis. Scores of informal
requests for action also have been re
reived. , .. ' ' .. 'K '

the Tlmmons, and those aboard the
Tlmmons were not close enough to
be sure they had seen the dive made
until wave after wave ot the heavy
sea had come up and gone down
without the submarine's light again
showing.
The submersion was made about a
mtle-outslde the capes, the Tlmmons'
crew reported when they put into
Norfolk early today.
Captain Hlnseh, ot the interned
German liner Neckar, who was
aboand the Tlmmons, said the last act
of Captain Koenlg and his crew be
fore they went below was to 'give
three cheers for the United Spates and
the American people. This was as
they neared the capes. '
Then all disappeared from the upper
structure of the submarine, Captain
Koenlg toeing last to descend, shout-'
lng a farewell to Hlnseh aa he dis
appeared. ' ''
"That'a the last that will be seen
ot her. until she bobs up In Bremen,"
declared Hlnseh.
Captatn Culllson, of the Tlmmons,
would only say: "I'm glad she's
gone."
It was the most worrisome bit of
piloting Captain Culllson haa had to
handle In many a day." It is under
stood Captain Koenlg planned to
work his way along the coast, north
or south, after submerging, putting
Into some port If forced to do so by
the enemy patrol. He desired to
drive out Into the Atlautlo the mo
ment he was sure the patrol had been
avoided. '

IS VOTE TO
GO TO HUGHES Oil
NOVEMBER 1TH
Denver, Aug. 3. One hundred
thousand dollars and the Influence
of the National Women's party will
be oast Into the balance in favor of
Charlea E. Hughes, and against Pre
sident Wilson, if the democrats fall
to pass the federal suffrage amend
ment at the present session of con-
gress.
Miss Anne Martin, chairman of the
women's party, stated to the United
Press here today:
"We must Judge the democratic
party on Its performance and the re
publican party on Its promises. Just
as we bold President Wilson to a
strict accountability for his suffrage
record, so we will hold Governor
Hughes to his promise of national
suffrage if he is elected.
"The leaders of the woman's party
are no ibebes In the woods. We real-
lie that politics and hope ot victory
may have had a great deal to do with
the change In Hnghes toward favor
ing national suffrage. But we have
not even a promise from the demo
crats. .. . ,''.."
"We have every confidence that as
a leader of his party Hughes . will
keen his word. , The party that se
cures the political freedom ot all wo
men will Inevitably win the undying
loyalty and adherence of the women
voters. Will the democrats give this
great opportunity to the republican
party!" . . a :
Miss Martin Is directing efforts to
raise a f 109,000 campaign rand for
the women's, party.' Anticipating no
satisfactory action from the demo
crats, Miss Martin stated that plans
have been practically completed for
a vigorous campaign by the women's
party In the 12 suffrage states In be
half of the republican party. ... ,
"I myself am a ".democrat? aald
Miss Martin. "I would like to vote
for President Wilson. But as a mem
ber of the women's party my first In
tent Is to secure national women
suffrage."
LUMBERMAN ENLISTS ;
FOR BORDER SERVICE
Marsh field, Aug. 3. Stanley F.
Bartlett, one of the best known lum
bermen on the Pacific coast, enlisted
tor service on the Mexican border to
day. Raymond Benham, wealthy
rancher, also enlisted. Captain Ben
ham is here on a recruiting tour.
Carolina, assigned to neutrality duty,
was ordered In from the capea to
day, indicating the belief ot govern
ment officials, at least, that the dan
ger ot neutrality violation had passed.
The Deutschland. appeared In the
bay after spending the day In Tan
gier sound, 35 miles up, just about
sunset and was cutting across toward
the capes as darkness began to tall.
She was displaying red and green
lights close to the water, but soon put
these out. x
'. Approaching the Cape Henry light
ship the submarine moved tn close to
Jhe shore and held back while the
Tlmmons proceeded someVilstance
out, presumably to determine If hos
tile vessels were in sight. Presently
she signalled and the Deutschland
moved on past the cape. This was
about 9 o'clock. . . ' , , ,
The Deutschland drew near enough
to her pilot tug to permit the shout
ing ot farewells and the cheering tor
America and then the rolling water
'began to pile up between them. She
signalled briefly with her periscope
light. Then that blinked out and the
tug turned back to Norfolk.
Captain Hlnseh said the Deutsch
land planned io submerge only dur
ing the day time, when well out to
sea, and tn the day time only when
absolutely necessary.
"She will proceed on the surface
like any other vessel at night as soon
as out ot the danger lone," he said.
' "We expeot to hear from her or
about her before she reaches
Bremen," he added.
