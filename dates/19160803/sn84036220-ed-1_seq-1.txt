Deutschland's Departure to Sea Fol

ceeding 8Iowly Most of the Way
Down She Increased Her Power at
6:30 and Reaohed the Capes Just
After Dusk, and as None of the Al
lied CruUers Was Visible She
Passed Through and Out to 8ea.
NORFOLK, Va.. Aug. 2.—The Ger
man submarine Deutschland passed
quietly cut of the Virginia Capes at
8:3U o'clock tonight on her homeward
voyage, apparently unobserved by Xie
allied warship patrol waiting outside
the three-mile limit. She was accom
panied to tlie capes by the tug Thomas
F. Timmins, which had convoyed her
down tlie bay from Baltimore, and by
a newspaper dispatcli boat.
Her departure to sea followed an
18-mile dash through the lower Chesa
peake bay. After proceeding slowly
most of the way down she increased
her power at 6:30 and reached the
capes just after dusk. None of the
allied cruisers was visible and she
passed through.
The submarine and the Timmins
were lost to the newspaper dispatch
boat, the only vessel following them
during a storm in lower Chesapeake
bay ahortly before daylight today.
From that time no vessels or light
houses reported sighting them.
Only one allied warship was seen
off the capes today. It was a two
funneled cruiser flying the British
naval ensign. Passing vessels report
ed that there were two peculiar buoys
near her. This gave rise to some
speculation as to the possibility that
a net had been flung across tlie chan
nel, but pilots familiar with the waters
did net believe such a method of pre
venting tlie egress of the Deutschland
would be attempted.
The trip of the submarine and the
convoying tug down Chesapeake bay
from Baltimore was started under ideal
conditions. Not a cloud was in sight
as the submersible increased her
speed to 19 knots an hour soon after
clearing Baltimore harbor. The tug
fell behind immediately and by durk
was 500 yards to the stern.
The tug apparently liad great diffl
cutly in keeping up with the Deutsch
land. Dark flames spurted from her
funnels, showing that the stokers were
keeping all the steam possible in her
boilers. Then the wind freshened and
dark clouds began to roll in from the
horizon. Soon the tug was pitching
and rolling on the choppy sea. her
running lights dipping up and down
and the spray flying back from her
bow.
The submarine ahead, a brilliant
light shining from a lamp attached to
the top of her periscope and green
and red running lights hanging below
on the conning tower, plowed steadily
through the seas on an even keel.
Bay steamers passing up aed down
had their attention attracted to the
submarine by the brilliance of lie*
lights, especially that on the peri
scope. They cast rays of iheir search
lights on the submersible, looking her
over from stem to stern. As each of
the vessels recognized the submarine
a salute of three whistle blasts was
blown. The submarine answered each
salute with her own whistle.
In the rays of the searchlights mem
bers of the crew could be plainly sec t
walking up and down the after deck.
In the conning tower was Capt. Paul
Koenig, master of the vessel. At his
side stood the pilot.
Soon before midnight tlie seas be
came still heavier. Under il:o glare
of searchlights It was teen that waxes
were breaking over the bow of the
vessel and washing t.ie entire fotward
part. Occasion!/ the conning tower
and the light on the periscope would
be enveloped in a shower of salt spray.
At 1:30 this morning, while passing
Colomon's island, tlie last of die ves
sels with searchlights was passed.
By that time all the members of the
crew except two had disappeared from
the deck. One of these men was
standing well forward, a lead line for
sounding In his hand, and the other
was at the stern. Captain Koenig still
was In the conning tower.

KIT
ANNUAL PICNIC
EXPERIMENT STATION AT MOC
CASIN ATTRACTS THOUSANDS
OF FARMERS THERE.
GOVERNOR AND OTHERS SPEAK
The Judith Basin was amply rep
resented at tlie Eighth annual Farm
ers' picnic held Friday at the ex
periment station at Moccasin, for it
ir. estimated that more thun 3,500 peo
ple visited the grounds during the
day, by actual count, while 500 auto
mobiles were parked there. The
weather was ideally pleasant, a few
clouds hut no wind nor threatened
storm. The grounds and buildings
were thrown open for inspection and
study of the experimental plots and
these were visited extensively during
the morning hours. There was plenty
going on all over the grounds from 10
in the morning until 6 at night, while
Ice cream, pink lemonade and instan
taneous photographers made it seem
like circus day.
Band Contest.
At 11 o'clock the band contest took
place, the Moccasin, Hobson and Den
ton bands competing. Votes were dis
tributed at a dollar each and while the
competition was very keen and voting
was heavy on both sides, the Moccasin
and Hobson band had a hit the better
of it.
At noon, lunch baskets were pro
duced, picnic sites being optional. At
1:30 a large crowd flocked to the
speaking pavilion where they heard
several prominent Montana men speak
on topics of paramount interest to
fanners. When the speaking was over
the opinion wag generally voiced that
the program had been well timed and
keenly interesting without being in
the least wearisome.
Speaking Pleatea.
Each speaker was allotted 15 min
utes and none overstepped liis limit.
Not that at least a half hour would
not have been welcomed from any
one of them for each and every ad
dress was both edifying and enter
taining. Hon. B. C. White of Buffalo
presided in his charmingly individual
way and he had something to say
worth hearing every time he rose to
his feet. He promised that all in the
range of the speakers' voices would
be entertained and instructed from
first to last aad it appears that he
had inside information.
Mr. White first introduced Mr. Cum
mings, newly elected principal of tlie
Fergus county high school. Principal
Cummings chose as his subject, 'Tlia
Function of a County High School,"
which is a problem as near his heart
as it ig any resident of tlie county.
It is Mr. Cummings' idea that a high
school should serve the county as a
whole as no other institution may,
and that county farmers should reap
the fullest benefit of their taxes by
means of practical education.
Rural Credit*.
President J. M. Hamilton of the
Bozeman state agricultural college,
was tlie second speaker. Being at
the head of an agricutural institution
President Hamilton knows as few edu
cators do, the. real problems of the
farmer aside from cut worm, fanweed,
and the like. He chose as the sub
ject of his discourse "Rural Credits
Under the Hollis Bill." He explained
simply and lucidly tlie exact provisions
of this bill and its relation to the
farmer and his demands.
Chancellor Elliott.
Present also was E. C. Elliott of
Helena, chancellor of the University
o? Montana. "The University of Mon
tana" was Mr. Elliott's theme. His
talk was brilliant with wit and en
thusiasm for the schools which he
hopes to expand to take their places
among the greatest educational insti
tutions in the United States. He stated
that more than anything else he want
ed to impress upon the minds of Judith

Alderman Charles L. Wentwortli

A LET UP UUHE FIGHTING
The armies in the three great ces

SAYS NEW YORK IS FULL OF BUY

CHANDISE HARD TO GET.
WHOLE COUNTRY IS PROSPEROUS
Mayor W. I). Symmes, who went
east a short time ago with A. William
son on a buying trip for the Power
Mercantile company, is home. He
spent four days in New York and two
in Chicago, getting back as quickly
as possible. He found New York full
of buyers, all clamorous for desirable
merchandise, and he also found prices
very high. The buyers realized this
fully, but there is no help for it—tlie
prices must be paid if tlie goodg are
to be had and even then it is not an
easy task to get just what is wanted
Country Prosperous.
"The country i 8 prosperous," no
doubt of that," said Mr. Symmes yes
terday. "Taking it as a whole, it is
looking fairly good in an agricultural
way, although there ure some very
dry sections this year. There is
plenty of work, wages average high
and there is a keen demand for manu
factured products. These facts have
created a prosperous condition that
is general everywhere."
Mayor Symmes was not here for
the bond election but lie wa M pleased
with the result, although he never
made the slightest effort to influence
anyone in regard to the park proposi
tion, being quite willing to accept the
decision of the taxpyers, whatever
it might be.
