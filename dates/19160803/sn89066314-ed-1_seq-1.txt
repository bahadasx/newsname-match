tended by a record breaking crowd.
At 10 oclock all of the seats were
filled. In .spite of the small crowd

ment for the crowd this morning. Ac
cording to Secretary Hob Hill, the

Columbia's Business Suspended This
Afternoon Recausc of Fair.
That Columbia loves a good fair is
shown by the fact that business is
practically suspended during fair
week and shoppers must make their
purchnsfcs in the naming because
merchants close up shop and take in
the fair in the afternoon. To a stran
ger the down town district resembles
a tropical city where every one takes
a siesta during the hot part of the
day, for practically every store Is
closed for the afternoon.
This afternoon the courthouse be
came quiet. The usual after-election
post mortcms and predictions were
postponed and practically the entire
force went to the fair. Eery office
was closed at 1 o'clock to give the
clerks and officers a half day off to
"play the ponies."

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 3 Additional re
turns today on Tuesday's state pri
mary indicated the almost certain
nomination of former Judge Henry
Lamm. Republican, and Colonel Fred
D. Gardner, Democrat, as their
parties' nominees for governor at the
Xovember election.
Predictions today from Jefferson
City, based upon unofficial reports so
far received, say that Lamm has de
feated Swanger for the Republican
nomination for governor by 8,000 to
10,000 votes.
Incomplete returns obtained here
from a majority of the counties of the
state today showed the following
standing of the candidates for gov

Atkinson 22.603

The nomination of Lamm on the
Republican ticket came as a surprise
to many of the party leaders who
were supporting Swanger for the of
fice. Lamm's strength in counties
heretofore claimed by the Swanger
forces was a revelation. The Lamm
lote in St. Louis, Kansas City and St.
Joseph gave the former judge a lead
which Swanger will not be able to
overcome.
The nomination of Gardner on the
Democratic ticket had been forecast
for several weeks, but the recent
claims of the supporters of Atkinson
indicated that the race would be much
closer than it was.

President Wilson in the threatened
