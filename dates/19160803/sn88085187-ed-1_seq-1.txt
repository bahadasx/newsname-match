MADE OF
OLD SAIL
OAK HILL, Ind., Aug. I— Here
on the shore of Lake Michigan, in
the foothills of higb sand .limes,
In a wilderness of pine trees and
a jungle of marshes, miles be
yond echo of human voices, has
been found "Diana of the Dunes,''
Alice Gray, University of ChleajO
graduate, who, since last October
has spoken less than a dozen
times to human creatures!
Diana of mythology was .ii.own
to the Romans as the chaste god
dcs —Diana the huntress. She
hated men and went Into the
wilderness to live in virgin pur
ity.
This "Diana" in the flesh was
found hedged from the world by
two miles of almost inponetrable
sand drifts and boggy marshes.
Hair Bobbed Like Boy's
It wan dawn when a girl re
porter came upon her retreat. The
hut was empty, but a tied of green
boughs, and two sinister revol
vers on the foot of the bed aos
isniirance she had found the '_er
nlt's hiding place.
A strong, lithe, clear-eyed,
smiling young woman, bare leg
ged as a nymph, hair cut boy fash
ion, face sunklssed to a tieep
brown, sprang through the nine
scrubs.
A single garment was her only
attire. She brushed through the
pines, surprise and terror flash
ing in her eyes.
"I am sorry they call me the
'hermit' and the 'mystery wom
an'," she said. "We are all mys
teries to somebody or other. I
must remain a mystery .0 the
public for a time. 1 came here to
the widerness to seek—well, TO
SEEK MYSELF.
Lived First in Cirve
"I found a cave here In ihe
hills, spread my hla-.iket,
slept under the Mars, mid
I'oiiiniiiiH'tl with myself. 1
BEGAN TO MVK. I have
had ten glorious months. I
have no worries nln.ui work,
about the (Ii lly grind of liv
ing and doing. 1 AM
FREE."
Her name is Alice Gray, ohe
,Taduated from University of
Chicago in 190:'.; held a secre
taryship in a -large publishing
house, and it was predicted she
would follow a literary career.
One day a red Mexican blanket
that adorned her college den, a
few clothes, and h?r pay envelope
with "just a few dollars in it"
were tossed into a grip.
Lives on 10 Cents a Pay
To the dunes she came. There
was no human habitation in sig it.
Only the birds gave her welcome.
In a dugout she spread her blan
ket.
"The dugout was too cold," 'ihe
says, "and I found this hut.
"■Everything I have here,
111 is, 1 lihii.ilh s cap I wear,
these tins, are driftwood,
drifted in from the hike—l
too, am driftwood.
"I got sail's cloth from afish
erman and made this thing I
wear. I got rid of everything that
looked like the city.
"Fishermen who live way up
the beach sometimes bring some
extra food from town, and 1 buy
It from them. Farmer boys sell
me eggß. I HAVE REDUCED
THE COBT OF LIVING TO AL

"Home day I suppose I'll
want to go back. But Ihe
city ran never give me
what the wilderness have giv
en me—|>eaee of mind, and

Say Real Woman Is Enyclopedia,
Umpire, Confessor, Cookbook
By Mabel Abbott
Two or three weeks ago 1
was jolting along a lonely
road near the Kitsap county
line.
Tlie stage driver seemed
lost in reverie. I supposed
his mind was busy with the
cmilit inn of the road or the
price of gasoline.
Suddenly he spoke.
Nay! Is Cynthia Grey a
real woman."
• * *
I am looking at Cynthia Grey
as I write this.
She Is sitting at her typewliter,
with a pile of mall beside her.
She is wearing a white blouse and
a dark-blue silk skirt.
She hasn't the faintest idea I
am watching her.
THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE
ASK CYNTHIA, AND THE SE
CRETS THEY TELL HER!
If she were to tell some of the
things she knows, there would be
social earthquakes in several
cities.
llul she never does.—And
yet she Is a "real woman!"
Cynthia's daily mail is a cross
section of life. Like life, it Is
mostly problems.
And like life, the problems are
mixed, big and little all jumbled
together.
The letter that Cynthia la
studying, while I watch her, may
be a request for a recipe for fruit
cake, or It may be the despairing
cry of a deserttd wife.
It may be an inquiry about the
naturalization laws, or the best
way to make a party dress, or It'
may be a story of sin and suffer
ing, or an offer of help from
someone who has been touched
by some such story.
Questions .ome to her from all
over the United States, and from
Alaska, Canada and Mexico. She
has even had letters from Eng
land.
Those from unexpected place*
usually begin, "A friend of mine
who use to live In Tacoma told
me about you."
She has many sources of In
formation from which to am.we
all theße questions. She is per
sonally known to the court, school
and police authorities, is in touch
with the city offices, the public
library, and with experts in many
lines. She has a set of encyclo
pedias on a shelf above her head,
and a file of indexed folders of
clippings at her side.
—But she In answei mil; the
letter on top of the pile hi
the would answer Ihe letter
of a friend, out of her own
head and heart.
That Is the way she answers a
great many letters. For many of
them are written just because the
writers have caught the human
note in Cynthia's column and
want a word of advice or sym
pathy or understanding. Cynthia
is the response to a great human
need.
Once a thief sent her the jew
elry he had stolen from a Ta
coma home.
it would he pleasant to be able
to record that he sent it because
Cynthia had touched his con
science; but the fact appears to
be that he sent it to prove that
it was not worth the value placed
on it by the owners in their re
port to the police.
• • •
One peculiarity about the ques
tions that come to Cynthia is
their way of running In streaks.
Some of these streaks are eas
ily explained, like the more than
200 letters asking how to make
rose heads, or the many requests
for the rules of the Colville land
drawing. But when It's finding
homes for babies, or asking ad
vice as to whether to run away
from home, the reason Is not so
plain.
She has learned, however, if
she gets two letters In rapid suc
cession on a given subject, to
look up all the information she
can, because she will need it.
Cynthia Is not superstitious,
she says, but that Is the way it
always goes. Once she had three
babies on her hands at one time.
Cynthia is not old, hut she has
a large fund of common senile,
and a wide tolerance, and a sense
■of humor.
ROBINSON
So the sad and terrible stories
that are told her sometimes do
not shake her faith in unman
nature.
She says she hears quite as
many fine and encouraging stor
ies, and that often the most In
teresting things in her column
are the discussions called out by I
the questions she cannot answer
herself.
"Are you a real woman,
Cynthia." I axked, as she
lays iisiil.- the misucn .1 let
ter and takes up another.
Cynthia looks up in mild
surprise, suspecting a joke.
"I hope so," she ways.
"Why?"
"Oh, somebody asked me."
I say. "And I thought my
self you were a sort of com
bination encyclopedia, um
pire, cookbook iiml . <mfes
s'ir."
Cynthia laugh*, and then
looks thoughtful.
"I think that's what being
a real woman means," nhe
says.

Tt is a shame that Jesse Junes, state senator, found it
necessary to hang up this forenoon when we were right
in the midst of an interesting telephone conversation
on politics.
I was asking him about tlie letter which ("ieorgc
I.cc, Seattle candklate for governor, now says he
wrote to Jones on Jan, 16, 1915.
'Hie partisan <i. (). I. prise of the slate printed it
Wednesday in connection with an attack by I.cc mi
I lie Tacoma Times and ihe other Northwest Scrippa
papers.
George I.cc has written many remarkable letters
almost anybody that has heard about them will have
Io concede that- -hut none is mure noteworthy than
the one to "My Dear Jesse" that I was asking said
Jesse ;il«nit.
In this Jan. 16 (?) epistle Le« advised Junes that
he believed senate bill No. -\<i In be highly dangerous
and urged Jones to vote against it.
Nothing truer ever ttnu written in <. letter. Senate

would hove given oerpeluol franchises to nil existing
public utility corporations ami hare practically deliv

It later developed thi. ■ itick Stone & Webster at
torney wrote tlie bill.
Well tlien, here is I.cc now producing a letter in
which he appears as having been on Jan. id, 1915, an
OPPONENT of that colossal attempt at looting a
1 onunon wealth.
The partisan (i. O. I. press .whose candidate Lee is,
publishes it with great gusto.
BUT—(here is why I called up Jones) by consulting
the files of these very same papers 1 discovered this
morning that Mr. I.cc either is mixed in his dates, or
else that he is the champion political wealthcrvane of
Ihe world.

he sent Jones his letter of good advice. LEE AP

lie wora his own clotheß instead of prison garb. He himself
helped the executioner adjust the noonse and pinion his limbs.
Once he exclaimed, "Lord, have mercy on my soul!"
The coroner's Inquest gave a verdict of "death by hanging."
Prison Governor Davis testified that death was instantaneous.
A hempen rope was used, despite Casement's plea for a silken
cord. '
Petitions for clemency were received by the government yes
terday, but the foreign office says no request for a reprieve had
ben received from the state department at Washington.
j.ord Robert Cecil, parliamentary under secretary of foreign
affairs and minister of war trade, gave out a statement explaining
the government's refusal to grant clemency to Casement.
"There Is no ground, public or private, so far as we know," he
said, "which can be quoted in mitigation of Casement's crime, and
I do not think any government doing Its duty could Interfere'with
the sentence which has been passed op him."
gentance waa executed In the Pentouville Jail. Sir Roger was
prontunced dead In nine minutes.

heard him and from the files of my own pai>er, I
would have ample proof of it from the files of tlie very
papers that now are supporting him.
The Tacoma I^tlger of Jan. io, 191}, for instance,
tells at length about I.cc's appearance before the com
mittee.
The Tacoma News of (he same date says "George A.
I.cc. formerly a member of the public service commis
sion, gave strong arguments in favor of the measure."
And again:
"Mr. I.cc said the measure would spell development
and commercial prosperity."
These accounts are verified by the Seattle 1.-1.,
which on the same day says I.cc '"supported the bill."
The Seattle P. 1. of Feb. 5, 1915. tells of a public de
bate in Seattle in which Lee argued uti the side of the
bill.
I.cc Was supported in his arguments before the leg
islative committee by Pratt, Hie Boston head of the T.
R. & P. Co.; James B. Howe and Norwood Brockett,
Seattle attorneys for Stone & Webster.
1 asked Jones if he remembered I.cc's remarkable
letter. He said he did.
1 called his attention to the lad that Lee must have
suffered some revolutionary change of heart between
those two January days if the date given on the letter
was correctly printed.
Jones saitl he didn't know anything about that, and
why didn't I send a reporter to see him |>ersonally.
"Can he see the original copy of the letter if I do?"
I asked him.
Great was my disappointment when the uncordial
Mr. Jones remarked negatively.
His letter files he keeps at his home, he explained;
not at his office.
However, he was sure the letter was authentic.
It is a shame he found it necessary to hang up just
then. I wanted so much to learn why it was that he
disregarded his friend Lee's able advice.
For, further investigation showed me, disregard it
Jones did, by voting for senate bill 300, the slightly less
cxlorous substitute that was produced from the T. R. &
P. pigeonholes when malicious No. 46 had to be
_il>andoned.
