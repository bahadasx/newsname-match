Carter Dalton has promised

next legislature in January and con
sequently he can most probably get
a bill through doing this early in Feb
ruary and an election can forthwith
be called and the city government
restored to the people by March.
This would give an entirely new set
of city officials as the majority of
those in now couldn't be elected by a
vote of the people and the two that
could probably win won't accept un
der any circumstances, we learn.
None will hold over a? some think
when Representative Dalton gets
through with the bill to restore the
government to the people, so there
fore the present officials would have
to hurry to spend all of the bond
money before their successes are
elected.

der the state law requiring only one

Yearly Meeting Today
And Of The Past
j The North Carolina Yearly Meet
ing; of Friends commences at Guild,
ford College the first half of August
These annual gatherings are a
great thing for the Quakers. For
maiiv Vftars the fnefindc urara Ua.)A
here in-what is now called the Old
Quaker Grove onLiodsay Street and
thousands of people from near and
fati attended, many from foreign
countries. Thq writer remembers
when the old-time Quakers attend
edvthese meetings, the women in
"schooner bonnets" and the men in
prairie hats." They were especj
pious in those days and thought
it a terrible thing to see any one
smoking cigaretts and chewing to
bacco and we well remember when
a boy what a lecture we received
by m aged Quaker on smoking.
Mahy bcfys were run off the grounds
for such offences" that are now
counted trifles in this "modern"
civilization. The spirit often moved
these consecrated people, at times
would get right ud in meeting and
speak : their sentiments without
ceremony or fall to their knees and
offer supplications during the ser
vice. There was no waiting to be;
asked but a spontaneous outburst
of the. soul. Sometimes the meet
was delayed quite a while because
no one was inclined to stop the ar
dent brother or sister.
.But these "good old testifiers" are
rarely found these days the idea
seemed to have passed away with
the good old fashioned Methodist
revival. Somehow we think the
worldjwould be better off if we could
only stop in our mad rush for the
dollar and prestige and society and
return, in part to the old fashioned
wysinwhich we at least had-time
to serve and honor God.

morning and was meeting with
a marked degree of success when
Captain McCuiston decided that it
was unfair for John to collect ch thes
for the flood sufferers in Wilkes and
placed him under arrest, a charge
of fake pretense being lodged
against the negro. The statement
that he had been authorized by the
city to make collections of clothing
was what led to the negro being
caught, so Captain McCuiston stat
ed. It was asserted that the negro
made his usual rounds and that
when one or two residences stated
that they had some trash removed
he informed them that he was . the
official collector of donations that
are to be forwarded the sufferers
from the flood in the western sec
tion of the state. The story was ac
cepted as the truth at three or four
places and the negro had made a
rather nice collection when the po
lice officer stepped in and put a

To Our Correspondents
The Review, as stated last week
desires to have a correspondent on
every route and from every post
office in a radius of from .10 to 15
miles of High Point and prizes
Worth working for have been offered
(see notice elsewhere) and. we hope
that the energetic young rrnen;andX--
Jl nf
the oner.
women in ima lerrjiory ;; wui. accept
ft
correspondent.; All correspondents'
must observe the following simple
rules which are essential to the
proper handling of the correspond
ence. 1. All letters must be mailed so as
to reach this office not later than 8
o'clock Tuesday morning. In case
of very important news happening
after that time and up to Wednesday
night, let us have it by letter or tel
ephone us (we will pay telephone
charges on all important news)
such as suicides murders, serious
accidents, deaths of prominent peo
ple, marriagsselopements, fires, dis
asters, and the like the correspond
ent has a good idea of what consti
tutes IMPORTANT NEWS.
2. Write only on one side of pa
per which shouldn't be over 8xll
inches. We will furnish paper and
envelopes free to all that call for it.
3. All local happenings wanted
in regular weekly letters social
items included but not mere visiting
from one family to the other of
neighbors. The name of the post
office of a visitor from a distance
should always be given as well as
Initials or first name of any party,.
"Mr. Johnson" isn't definite there
are scores of "Mr. Johnsons," but
"David R. Johnson" is explicit.
Leave off "Mr." in mentioning a
male but affix "Miss," "Mrs.," "Rev."
or "Dr." as the case may be.
4. Everything that "smacks" of
free advertising leave out without
party desires to pay for it at regular
rates. News is only wanted. "John
Jones is doing a good business in
selling groceries at Ebenezer," etc.,
is an advertisement straight out.
We get pay for such.
5. The right is reserved to leave
out any or all correspondence as oc
casion demands but it is the policy
of this paper to print all correspond
ence not objectionable, space and
time permitting.
6. Any correspondent who fails
for four successive weeks without
good excuse, to send m items will
forfeit his or her subscription and
position and of course will not stand
a good chance to win any of the
prizes offered.
7. Be sure to sign your real name
to each letter for our protection.
You can use an assumed name at
the bottom of your letter if you wish.
Don't write anything but the truth
and Especially of a very serious
nature for the truth without you
know or have good reason to believe
is is so.
Now let's work together and
make a fine page of country corres
pondence and I am sure we will all
like it. -
