GIRL S PLEA SAVES FATHER.
Governor of Georgia Pardons Thomas
Edgar Strippling. I
Atlanta, July 29.?Thomas Edgar
Strippling, who served as chief of po'
lice of Danville, Va., for almost four
of the fourteen years that he was an
escaped convict, was granted a full
pardon by Governor Nat E. Harris at
six o'clock tonight.
Since the first day that "Chief R.
E. Morris," of Danville, was brought
- back to Georgia to resume his life
sentence as Strippling influential attempts
were made through three
administrations to have him pardon(
ed. All these failed, however, until
Governor Harris went to Milledgeville
in July, 1915, to inspect the
'State prison farm.
Little Girl's Plea.
While there one of Strippling's
eight children, a girl of six, ran to
( him in the prison grounds and bashfully
pleaded to "please let my papa
out because he is sick and we all
. need him so bad." The incident
r touched the aged governor and he
promised "to send your father back
. to you some time during his term."
> After completing an exhaustive re
view of the case, Governor Harris to.
night dispatched a letter to little Bessie
Strippling and completed the case
in its last sentence with, "after all
it is the offering from the governor's
heart to the love and innocence of
a little child."
L Strippling, on September 4, 1897,
r shot and killed W. J. Cornett, his
neighbor, in Harris county, Georgia,
r He fired through a window of Cor.
nett's house. He surrendered at Columbus,
Georgia, a few days after,r
ward and eventually was found guilty
and sentenced to life imprison.
ment.
Strippling testified at the trial and
? it was corroborated that Cornett had
5 insulted both his wife and married
sister; that Cornett had threatened
to kill him and that when passing
. Cornett's house the night of the killt
ing he could not restrain himself
j from 6hooting when he saw Cornett
. passing a window with a light in his
hand. He claimed self-defence, as
l he said he believed "it was either
. Cornett's life or mine some time."
L He escaped from the Harris coun5
ty jail when his case was awaiting
[ the outcome of an appeal. He remained
hidden about two months at
the home of his uncle in Harris coun
ty and then made his way to North
Carolina .where his wife joined him
' in 1899. Under the name of R. E.
> Morris he did different kinds of work
in several towns for a number of
5 years. Finally he was employed by
the Southern railway as a special
5 agent. That work took him to Dan>
ville, where he had been about one
year when he obtained a place on
- the police force. Nine months later
the escaped convict was elected chief
" of police.
Two Men Who Knew Him.
Strippling has stated since his return
to Georgia that there were two
men in Danville who knew his life
? story, but they remained silent. " Fi.
nally a man well known in Harris
county saw him and soon afterwards
reports of Strippling's whereabouts
I were heard. These reports seemed
to C. M. Smith, a private detective,
to warrant investigation. He obtain.
ed requisition papers from Governor
I Brown and went to Danville. Smith
established the identification beyond
L a doubt.
On March 4, 1911, the Danville
. council was to elect a chief of police
t and it is said Strippling was practically
assured of reelection, notwith.
standing some opposition had arisen
. because he had killed a young white
j man who had resisted arrest, had
killed a negro who was attempting to
rob his home and shot another negro
while resisting arrest. He was exonerated
of blame in each case.
> On the afternoon of March 3, how
ever, Smith presented the requisition
* papers to Danville authorities. Strip5
pling was confronted with the fact
: and admitted his identity.
Strippling requested the mayor and
- members of council who at that time
were unaware of his plight, to meet
i that night as he had an important
statement to make. Before the body
r that probably would have elected him
chief of police for another term the
' next night he stood handcuffed, but
in his uniform, and told the story of
I- the shooting of "Bill" Cornett, of
' the escape and movements during the
: nearly fourteen years of freedom. He
still wore his uniform when placed
in jail in Georgia.
' His family moved to Milledgeville
. soon after he was sent to the prison
and has resided near the prison farm
since. Strippling is now represented

GASOLINE DROPS A PENNY.
After Several Months Market Breaks,
Causing General Joy.
Charleston, July 29.?After one
year of country-wide complaint,
comic cartoons, congressional investigations
and continued increase in
price, all caused by and referring to
gasoline, the market price of that
almost indispensable fluid has dropped
suddenly one great big copper
nont o nrollnn T af iav I \ a ii n^nn li n Qi1
vvub a* gaiiuu* ju; uuv^v/iiii iiv^vi.
Thanksgiving day comes on the last
Thursday in November, but this is
a special time of thanksgiving for
gasoline buggy owners.
"Do you think there will be a still
further decline in price?" a salasman
of the precious fluid was asked.
"I'm afraid there will be," he said.
It all happened here at midday
yesterday, but so unexpectedly was
it to the local consumer that the joyful
news spread slowly. The dispensers
of gasoline say they expected
it; that they have been expecting it
for weeks. But they kept it to themselves
until yesterday when they
chalked upon the "bulletin boards"
of prices a figure that has not been
seen there since last March 8, when
prices took the last soar from 24 1-2
to 25 1-2 cents a gallon.
The dealers are admitting today
that the price of gasoline may go as
low as 20 cents a gallon this year,
but are warning the consumer not
to expect a decline in prices commensurate
with the unprecedented
rise. Prices may continue to go
down, they say, but it will be a long,
long time, if ever, before a gallon of
gasoline can be bought for 14 cents,
as it was last July.
Probable Cause.
At first it was opined freely that
local storm conditions and consequent
bad roads has so Cut the demand
that a decrease in price naturally
ensued. But those who are
in position to know deny this, and
point out that the decrease is not at
all local, but is general throughout
the country. And the reason .given
is that the strengthening of the market
last summer and fall started the
drilling of more new oil wells in the
west than have been drilled in the
Jast ten years. The supply from
these additional walls is now getting
on the market and is causing the
weakening of the market.
Local dealers do not believe that
peace abroad will cause any great
slashing of prices in the gasoline
markets, and they think an increased
supply is the only thing that car
cause a decreased price. Evidentlj
they believe a further increase in
supply is probable, as they are expecting
another drop in price withir
the next month.
However that may be, local automobilists
are pleased that the long
deferred break in the market has
come. Last fall and spring they almost
lost hope when congressional
investigations seemed to result onlj
in increased prices. The market
steadied after climbing from 14 tc
25 1-2 cents in about nine months
| and 'stayed steady until yesterday.
MONEY FOR GOOD ROADS.
Total of $1,438,059 of Federal Fund
Goes to Southern States.
Washington, July 26.?The thirteen
Southern States will receive a
total of $1,438,059 of the $5,000,000
federal road fund made available for
this fiscal year under the new federal
aid road act approved this month.
The department ofyftgriculture an
nouncement. today showed that Texas
received the largest allotment of
any State in the union.
The apportionments to the Southern
States follow:
Texas, $291,927; Georgia, $134,329;
Oklahoma, $115,139; North
Carolina, $114,381; Tennessee,
$114,153; Alabama, $104,148; Virginia,
$99,660; Kentucky, $9.7,471;
Mississippi, $88,905; Arkansas, $82,689;
South Carolina, $71,807;
Louisiana, $67,4 74; Florida, $55,976.
These funds are made available
contingent upon the States
spending an equal amount on road
construction and are apportioned on
a basis of one-third in the ratio of
area, one-third in the ratio of population
and one-third in the ratio of
mileage of rural delivery routes and
star routes.
Under the federal act a total of
$75,000,000 for the improvement of
State roads is made available during
the next five years, the appropriation
for 1918 being $10,000,000; for
1919, $15,000,000; for 1920, $20,000,000,
and for 1921, $25,000,000.
As the States must supply an equal
amount each year, a total of $ 1 50,000,000
will be spent on State roads
during the five-year period.
STATE CANDIDATES HERE
ASPIRANTS FOR STATE OFFICES
SPEAK TO BAMBERG VOTERS.
About 1,500 in Crowd.?Governor
Manning Easily the Favorite.
Meeting Very Orderly.
A crowd estimated at 1,000 to 1,500
heard the candidates for State
offices present their claims upon the
voters at the campaign meeting
Thursday last. Each candidate was
given a most respectful hearing, and
I bitterness was conspicuous for its absence.
It was a quiet, orderly meeting,
and the people evidently came
with the desire of learning the qualifications
each candidate presented
for the office he aspired to fill. Nearly
every candidate was given applause.
Governor Richard I. Manning was
easily the favorite with the crowd.
The governor was greeted with lusty
cheers, and was frequently interrupted
with applause. At the conclusion
of the governor's speech, he was given
a prolonged applause and was
presented with several beautiful bouquets
of flowers, bearing streamers
with the governor's name printed
thereon.
\ Perhaps the outstanding feature of
i the meeting was the answers Mr.
Cooper gave to the questions of Gov
ernor Manning. The governor had
asked Mr. Cooper at several meet1
ings how he would have acted on va.
rious administration measnrps un/j
what action he would have taken
? with regard to several matters that
have arisen during Mr. Manning's
term of office. Mr. Cooper stated
' that in almost every instance he
would have taken the same action as
did Governor Manning, and that he
- had no criticism to make of the gov!
ernor upon any of his official acts.
L That while he differed with him on
> a few matters, he could not say
- that he would have acted other than
1 Governor Manning did, under the cir
cumstance's which surrounded the
s governor at the time.
! The meeting was called to order by
5 County Chairman H. C. Folk in the
1 court house, but the meeting was ad?
journed to the lawn in front of the
5 court house in order that all of the
crowd might hear the candidates.
- Mr. Folk requested a careful and at'
tentive hearing for each one of the
- candidates.
I Secretary of State.
L The first candidates introduced
were those aspiring for secretary of
1 State, W. Banks Dove being the first
speaker. Mr. Dove is chief clerk in
1 the office of secretary of State, and
ne Denevea tnat his eight years ex|
perience fitted him well for the of'
fice. He pointed with pride to his
twelve years' service as a school
teacher. He received applause.
Mr. Dove was followed by George
W. Wightman, State senator from
Saluda county. He spoke of his record
in the State senate, and explained
his opposition to compulsory education
and to the child labor law. He
was applauded.
State Treasurer.
I S. T. Carter, who stands for reelection
as State treasurer, defended
his administration, and told of his
. work in the sale of the State bonds,
and the low rate of interest secured
i on the State loan. He was well re.
ceived.
D. W. McLaurin, for State treasurer,
made a severe attack on Mr.
. Carter, going into detail on several
; of the matters connected with the
! State treasurer's office recently. His
speech elicited some applause from
. the audience.
Lieutenant Governor.
Dr. E. C. L. Adams consumed the
greater part of his time in telling the
people why Mr. Beathea should not
be reelected. He ridiculed Bethea's
peace voyage, saying that if he is
elected he will stay at home and attend
to his business. He made a
number of charges against the lieutenant
governor, some of them being
of a personal nature.
A. J. Bethea, who aspires to reelection
as lieutenant governor, defended
himself well against the onslaughts
of his opponent and evidently
had the crowd, with him. He paid
a fine tribute to the late J. A. Hunter,
saying that Mr. Hunter never
stooped to"-personalities in the contest
of two years ago, in which Mr.
Bethea was elected. Mr. Bethea said
he stands for clean politics and denounced
mudslinging and personal
references. "The time is coming,"
said Mr. Bethea, "when a man seeking
election on the demerits of his
opponents will go down in oblivion."
After consuming seven minutes in
answering the charges of his oppo
DAMAGE CAUSED BY BLAST.
Explosion in Which Munitions Warehouse
was Wrecked.
New York, July 30.?Property loss
estimated at $25,000,000, was caused
early today by a series of terriffic explosions
of ammunition waiting shipment
to the Entente allies and stored
on Black Tom island, a small strip
of land jutting into New York bay,
off Jersey City. mhe loss of life still
was problematical tonight. It will
not be determined definitely until
there has been opportunity to check
UD thfc workman pmnlnvpH rm tho ic
land and on boats moored nearby.
nent, Mr. Bethea used the remaining
four minutes in a sound discussion
of his qualifications for office. He
refrained from making any charges,
personal or otherwise, against Dr.
Adams, but intimated that Dr. Adams
may have an opportunity of proving
his charges in court. He was loudly
applauded.
For the office of railroad commissioner,
the five candidates made
speeches in the following order: W.
T. Thrower, James Cansler, Albert S.
Fant, and G. McDuffie Hampton, the
present incumbent. At the conclusion
of Mr. Hampton's speech, he
was presented with a bouquet of
flowers. Each was given an attentive
hearing and applause was about
evenly distributed among them. *
Candidates for Governor.
The candidates for governor began
speaking at one o'clock. Although
the day was hot and sultry, the
crowd remained patient through all
the speeches of the other candidates
awaiting tile turn of the "governors."
The first to speak was John M.
DesChamps, who described himself * .
as the "barnyard candidate." He
says that he does not belong to as\y
faction and is glad of it. He is a
South Carolinian first, last and always.
He told of the vast resources
of the State and of the need for unity
and cooperation. He made a strong
plea for a better and more united
citizenship. He defended the corporations
against unjust abuse and
criticism, and said they are often the
poor man's best friend?certainly
better than the cheap'politician. He
said that if he waited until his turn
came to run for governor it would
not come around foT 108 years, and
by that time he wouldn't have it. His
stories and jokes got the crowd in
an excellent humor. He closed amid
1 %
laughter and applause.
John T. Duncan, the next candidate
for governor, consumed his time in
his usual discussion of the socalled
"system," and he received the ap-,
plause of two or three persons when
he retired.
Richard I. Manning.
The interest, which had lagged
while Mr. Duncan was speaking, was
OjUickly revived when the chairman
announced the next speaker, Governor
Richard I. Manning. He 'was
greeted with much applause. The
governor spent every minute of his
time in an earnest discussion of his
candidacy, making a frank and open
record of his administration in office.
He announced that he was here
to give an account of his stewardship;
he had no desire to stir factionalism
or to assassinate anyone's
character, but looks forward to the
uplift of citizenship and better conditions.
Two years ago, said the governor,
4.V. ... nnlll.
Liiere >vcib many piuuicms iui ouiution.
The one paramount issue then
was the lawless condition of the State
and whether or not this condition
was to be continued. This is still
the issue today. At that time the
verdicts of the courts counted for little,
the pardon power was abused,
race track gambling ran rampant,
blind tigers and open barrooms flourished.
The courts were demoralized.
The people of the State by their balInt
riPfMripri that thpsp cnnditions
must cease. "Have I carried out your
orders?" asked the governor.
The governor revoked the commissions
of the State constables, as they
were useless, and called on the local
authorities to cooperate with him in
enforcing the law. This worked well
in many places, but in Charleston it
failed. He appointed special constables,
and instructed them that the
liquor laws must be -obeyed there,
that there was to be no bloodshed,
but that with firmness and determination
the blind tigers must be put
out of business. The places then inhabited
by blind tigers and open saloons
are now closed; some of them
I are now used for legitimate business
and many others have "For Rent"
signs tacked above their doors.
"How about your local affairs?
Have they improved since I went into
office?" The fight must be kept
