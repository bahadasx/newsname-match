A couple of the boldest rob
beries ever staged look pkee in
Liberal Thursday night, when
- holdup men in true robber fash
. ion relieved two of our citizens
of a to'al cash outlay of $47.80.
The robberies were committed
about 11:30 that night down near
the depot and near the Carson
hotel. Friday night another
- holdup was staged near the
Southwestern hardware. The
knights of darkness made their
- getaway and for a time it ap
peared as if they would not be
caught, but officers were oa the
; lookout for them and Sheriff
Dobson landed bis victims Mon
day in Dalbart, bnngiug them
- home that day". Tuesday they
were arraigned in justice court,
given a preliminary and bound
over to await trial at the next
term of district court. It de
veloped in the course of the trial
that they are I. W. W.'s, true to
name in every way, shape, and
form. They are bad actors and
should be given abundant time
to think it over before theyari
turned loose again on a suffering
public. Liberal has lately been
. infested too greatly with this
class of cattle and the sooner
the advent of footpads in this
section is made very unwhole
some for the offender the better
for everyone. Liberal News.

Painter Writes
It was my good fortune to be
in Eureka, Greenwood county,
attending their reunion last week
and soon after my arrival on tbe
street 1 met one of our old fel
low townsmen, J. L. Clark, who
was almost universally known as
Joe. He has changed but little,
somewhat grayer and consider
ably stouter. He is in the drug
business and seemingly doing
well. Carries a large stock; his
sales room and storage room,
which is partitioned off of tbe
west end of the store are as
much as 125 feet. He lives on
the west side of the court bouse
square, about a block from his
place of business. Senior Vice
Commander, Denison and wife,
and myself called on Mrs. Clark
and daughter. Mr. and Mr?,
Denison were old friends of tbe
Clark family, having been ac
quainted with both before their
marriage, they having lived in
Greenwood County fifty years
ago, before he came to Shawnee.
With Mrs. Clark and daughter,
we spent a short t'me very
pleasantly talking of the early
settlers of Meade county. Mrs.
Clark looks much stronger than
when she . left Mtade over one
fourth of a century ago.
The second day there A. I ,
Stickel, former principal of tbe
schools in Liberal called on me.
Many Meade people will remem
ber him, as.be was quite prom
inent in educational matters in
the southwest. He is now con
nected with the Southwestern
College at Winfield.
Our only disappointment in all
the trip was that my old tent
mate and comrade of my own
company had recently died, and
I bad looked forward to a true
reunion with him, Tbe old boys
spoke well of bim as one of tbe
old settlers and a splendid cit
izen.
The country around Eureka is
supposed to be in the oil belt and
oil u on the tongue of eyery one.
Parties trying to secure leases,
oil prospecters, oil men of all
kinds aud I suppose quality
swarm around the hotel lobbies
as thick as bees in a patch of
white clover located near an
apairy Some oil and some gas
have been struck; no oil gushers
that I have beard of, but was
confidently told drilled wells
were pluged by the owner and
would so remain until all tbe
and was leased. Having spent
along time in boom mining towns
we expect to bear various and
sun Jry stories that we can ex
ercise our judgment abont be
lieving. Their soldiers' reunion was a
grand success. Several nearby
towns, some in other counties,
form what tbey term a regiment
for reunion purposes. They
elect a Colonel who is in cam
mand and who is also the pre-

Ice Plant -
R. S. Gerow today informed
us that be has ordered an ice
plant. Since it will take six
weeks at tbe very least to man
ufacture and ship tbe plant and
at least three weeks to install it,
no ice will be made before next
season.
With the manufacture of ice
will come a twenty-four hour
electric current.
Mr. Gerow is to be compli
mented on this enterprise.
A large amount of new wheat
is being brought to the Meade
elevators. Tbe highest price
paid this week was $1.13 paid
Wednesday. A lartre per cent
of the wheat" has not yet been
threshed.
Last Saturday the three-year
old girl of Jacob S. Friesen,
who lives south-east of Meade,
got a large glass bead lodged in
her nose. Dr. Davies was called
and soon succeeded in removing
same.
Dr.G. A. Davies will promptly
correct any trouble. you may be
having with your eyes.
C. E. Leader left the first of
the week for Hansford, Texas,
where he expects to remain for
the present.

John C Wynr.and family, of
Wesson, Arkansas, arrived in
Meade today. They own land
six miles west of 'tbe old Car
thage townsite upon which they
will locate permanently, Mr.
Wynn was in Meade county with
his father, J. W. Wynn, iu 1885
8, who at that time owned land
five miles west of tbe Ctrtbage
townsite. Mr. Wynn relates
two interesting features of their
tup. The first, that they came
tbe entire distance, over a thou
sand miles in their Ford and all
the trouble i they bad on tbe
entire trip amounted. to one little
blowout. The second, that their
cur of furniture and sloe..' left
Wesson at noon, Thursday July,,
27tb and tbey left in their Ford'
the same day at 4:30 p. ro. tbe
same day. When they arrived
at the crossing north of town,
this' morning it was blocked by
a freight train, and in looking
over the cars while they waited
for it to be cleared, one car look
ed familiar, upon inquiry tbey
learned it bad been chartered at
Wesson, Arkansas. So there
was no mistake, it was theirs.
Tbe News welcomes Mr. Wynn
and family back to Meade county.
