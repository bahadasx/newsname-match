LOCAL BUYER
$1.15 FOR WHEAT
Wheat prices climb to the top notch
when Mr. Salley, tho local buyer for
the Light Elevator Company, visited
thu plains country anil more than mot
competition. He offered the farmers
$1.10 per bushel or more than live
hotter than that paid at Melrose, hut
on reaching home he found wheal had
(tone up and he therefore promises to
give those who will come at once the
henetlt of this rai.se. He is today of
fering $1.15 a bushel and will even
pay moro if the market will allow it
at tho time of delivery.
Mr. Salley is a live wire and repre
sents one of the largest elevator com
panies in southwest Kansas, therefore
lie will he ready to meet all competi
tion and the furmoiM may well feel
free to bring their wheat in without
contract as it will mnke no difference
to him. He is ready to pay the best
price the market affords.
Threshing is progressing nicely on
the plains and thousands of bushels
of wheat are now ready for market.
Wheat advanced seven cents Tuesday
in Hutchinson, Kansas and the buyers
there are now offering $1.15. The
Hutchinson News says "We are likely
1o see still higher prices, a grain man
predicted today. The heavy loss in
I he northwestern crop rust is making
a shortage in supply. Kansas lias ex
con jonully fine wheat, and it will he
in st Tong demand.
f, 'en jf the war ends it will not
affect the n-'inket, for it will only re
duce oc viui rates so that there will he
a bigger ' .demand for export wheat. I
can't see Anything hut higher prices."
Many gi men were predicting to
day that w.'iunt would reach the Sl.fiO
mark again. The shortage of cars,
which makes it almost impossible to
ship wheat is also having an effect.
Work on th c- new elevator is pro
gressing nicely vd the office building
will lie constructed on the lots across
from the Olenrock Hotel as soon as
the scales arrive imJ are put in place.
The scales loft K.'insits City Monday
and are due here any time.
If you drive to town with wheat
most any store keeper will assist you
in finding Mr. Salley and ho will pay
cash for your grain. No trade coupons
hut a straight business proposition.

that were altogether now and highly
appreciated by everyone. Stories
were told of the missionaries that
thrilled the hearts and gave each a
renewed zeal for the work among
our "neighbors." Incidents were giv

and when they reported R. P. Donohoo
moved that they bo accepted, which
was done without an assenting vote.
, The list was made up from the pri

Prof. Wiseman, who was the couch
for the basket ball team and teacher
of the eighth grado at the high school
building, was a personal friend nnd

stay in Tucumcari and his letter con
cerning the loss by death of Mr. Ellis
is here given as written by him:
Letter From Prof. Wiseman
I have just received notice of tho
death of Jay Verno Ellis, who died nt
Denver, Colo.. July 22, 1910, from ty
phoid fever.
His death comes as a shock to us
all, and especially to me, for, I having
been so closely associated with him
for the last year, my sympathies wcro
with him as a brother.
Ho was a Christian young man who
lived nt home as lie did in public. His
life was without reproach. Ho was
ambitious energetic and nlways saw
the silvery lining to darkest clouds.
He was a graduuto from tho Ames,
college in Iowa, and would havo re
ceived a degree and state diploma
from tho Denver University this sum
mer. Ho was qualified for a life of
usefulness, and took sick while at
work in school.
Last year ho was principal of tho
Tucumcari High School, and I voico
the sentiments of tho teachers who
worked witli him and of all his pupils
and many friends, when I say that we
grieve his death as that of the most
faithful friend nnd toucher. In our
associations with him, his deeds nnd
words have left memories in ourhcarts
that time cannot erase. He has gone
where honors await him that earth
could not give, but the examplo of his
life is still with us, and shall Inspire
us to live a bettor life, that wo muy
sometime meet him in the great be
yond. Our henrt felt sympathies are with
Ills father, mother and brothers. While
they grieve tho loss of a noble son and
brother, we deeply feel the loss of a
personal friend.

VERNE S. ELLIS
Three young men fairly woll dress
ed, arrived in Tucumcari Monday and
proceeded to buy a pair of pants. Thoy
were carrying their coats over ono
shoulder and first entered II. Bonem's.
Hero they stored four or fivo pairs of
trousers under their arm covered by
the coat, but James Abeyta, ono of tho
clerks suspicioncd they were shop-lifting
nnd made them give up their stolen
goods.
They evidently waited a few hours
before going to Israel's whero they
tried to engngo Mr. Israel while ono
of them stole a pair or two of pants.
Ho made his get-nwny, going down to
tho depot but Mr. Israel could not see
nnything under his nnn ub it was
completely covered by tho overhanging
cont. It was afterwards learned that
ho sold a pair of pants to a fellow who
left on the train.
Mr. Israel notified tho oflkers und
tho M. B. Goldcnberg Co., to be on tho
lookout for these men. They went to
Goldenbergs but did not succeed in
getting away with any clothing. From
there they wont to Garrotts and whilo
Mr. Garrett wai. showing ono of them
somo pants tho others swiped fivo
pairs and did not buy anything.
One of tho men went to tho saloon
and bought a "can" of beer and nil
three went to a house near tho stock
yards to divide their loot and drink to
their good luck.
Onicors Horton, Winter and Smith
followed their trail nnd when they
hove in sight one of the fellows was
attempting to sell a pair of pants to
n mcxican who chanced to be passing.
When he spied these three men ho
tossed the pants into tho weeds hard
by and denied ever having seen them
before the ofllcor picked them up. Tho
officers then examined tho other men
and found several new pairs of pants
under their coats on tho ground. All
thrco were arrested and placed in tho
new city lock-up, which wns equipped
with iron beds and springs. A few
hours after their confinement Marshal
Horton chanced to call upon them and
found the jail nearly torn down. They
ind taken thc bed apart and used tho
rou sides to pry open tho doors and
windows und smash tho cement walls.
Within a few minutes liioy vould havo
been out and gone. When Horton gain
ed admission to tho jail all three of
the men pretended to ho asleep and
clnimcd to have no knowlcdgo of tho
attempted destruction of tho jail. Mr.
Horton culled assistance and tho men
were lodged in thc county jnil.
They were tried beforo Judge Mc-
Eiroy Tuesday and ho sentenced them
to .'i0 dnys each in jnil nnd 100 each
fine. They are now star boardera
nt Mr. Winter's hotel, nnd after they
have served their time out for destoy-
ing public property, Mayor Israel in
tends to hnve them tried for stealing
the pants and when they nro sentenc
ed to street work they wiil each bo
presented with a ball and chain, a
shovel or n hoc and a boss to sco that
they work. Mr. Israel says "No work,
no cats."

NEW MEXICO'S PROSPERITY
Ono gets a better idea of Silver
Glfv's llnnncial solidity in reading
statistics drawn from tho latest bank
statements showing the total deposits
represent an equivalent of $-144.00 for
each of the town's JC00 inhabitants.
It does not mean, of course that each
of Silver City's inhabitants hns $tll.
Some havo less und others very much
more. It is an nverngo and prohnbly
not a crcat many towns of the size o
Silver City, or lnrger for thut matter,
can show n better finnncinl statement.
However, every town of tho south
west Is now experiencing thc greatest
prosperity it has ever known. High
conner. high cnttlo, good crops,
strong wool market and silver higher
than it has been in many n year, fur
nish part of thu reason for tho pros
perity. Tho other part is psycholocl-
cal. Tho minds of tho peoplo uro
keyed to great activity, liberal in
vestments and largo returns. It is
a great year in tho best part of tho
United States.
Reverting to Now Mexico conditions
exclusively, nnd considering tho ono
item of crops, tho general forcenst for
the stnlo is a yield if 85.0 percent of
normal, with 2,091,000 bushels of corn,
1,0-14,000 bushels of winter wheat,
2,059,000 bushels of oats, 302,000 bush
els of barley, two tons of hay to tho
acre, 050,000 bushels of potatoes, 124,
000 barrels of apples, 154,000 bushels
of peaches, and 04,000 bushels of pears,
Those nro figures which forcast a
happy Thanksgiving noxt fall,
