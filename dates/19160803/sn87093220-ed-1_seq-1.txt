THIRTIETH YEAR
TAXING AUTHORITIES ARE
RECKLESS WITH CREDIT
Taxpayers Suffer Heavy Penalty in Interest
Charges in Consequence. Western Wash

COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS LEAD THE VAN
State Now Owes Over $100,000,000, Ten Per
Cent of Assessed Valuations, and Over
$80.00 Per Capita
The taxpayer who lias been com
plaining of the high rates of taxation
will have an opportunity ....is fall to
demonstrate the fact that they favor
a reduction of public expenditures. A
referendum measure will be on the
ballot that, should it carry, will do
much to lessen taxes by placing checks
upon disbursing officials. This is the
budget bill, which is being opposed
by some chronic office holders and
professional politicians, and will re
quire officials who spend public mon
ey to say just what they are going to
.spend it for when they make the tax
levy.
It will do away with the befuddling
talk of mills, ratios and assessed or
.actual valuations. If the county com
missioners are going to build a bridge
or a road they must say where, what
kind and how much they are going to
pay for it. The same is true of city
councils, school directors and all pub
lic officers having discretion in the
expenditure of public funds, and when
the money is once appropriated for a
specific purpose it can be used for
none other.
It is quite clear to all thinking
people of the state of Washington
has been very reckless In taking ad
vantage of the public credit ever
since it was admitted to statehood,
until today we are paying interest on
indebtedness of over $100,000,000, over
480 per capita. The exact figures, as
compiled by E. D. Cowen, in the Spo
kane Spokesman-Review, are $10.5.352,-
547, which he tabulates by counties and
cities.
Oraya Harbor county has outstanding
general bonds, $162,000; school dis
trict bonds, $577,960, total, $739,960,
or $18.48 per capita. Aberdeen is list
ed with, general and water bonds,
$585,000; outstanding warrants, (Dec.
31, 1915) $178,201, local improvement
bonds and warrants, $516,985. Total
debt, $1,280,186, or' $91.69 per capita.
Hoquiam appears with general
bonds, $115,000, warrants, $223,889,
local improvement obligations, $268,-
491, a total of $607,880, or per capita,
$60.28. Montesano labors under bonds
$25,359, warrants, $14,435, local im
provements, $75,395, a total of $115,-
189, or $42.46 per capita. Elma is ex
hibited with water bonds, $10,000,
warrants, $5,122, local improvement
Indebtedness, $31,742, a total of $46,-
864, a per capita of $40.98.
An Expensive Credit System.
Showing the recklessness that has
prevailed In regard to incurring in
debtedness, Mr. Cowen says:
"In order to emphasize the strain
put upon the taxpayer by the heed
less accumulation of bonded debt and
the proneness of public officials to
keep government on a credit rather

ABERDEEN HERALD
EIGHT PAGES
r than a cash basis, I have gone the
length of compiling the record of in
terest payments on county and school
district warrants and bonds as far back
as it is possible to get approximately
correct data on the subject. This is
for the period beginning with 1910,
when the first reports of county au
ditors on a uniform plan was institut
ed by the state bureau of inspection.
The aggregate will be slightly defi
cient, owing to the fact that in some
instances the interest payments are
confounded in the annual reports with
the redemption of principal and can
not now be segregated. However, this
defect will not be on the side of ex
aggeration, and the result of the pains
taking tabulations will give us a fairly
accurate idea of the tax waste con
cealed in the reckless financing of i
public business.
"The subjoined table will show that
during the past Bix years the sum total
of $8,536,489 was paid by the tax
payers of the state in interest charges
on only two classes of obligations,
county and school district bonds and
warrants. This is an average of
$1,422,748 for each year, although the
annual payments progressively In
crease out of proportion to current
expenditures for government.
"The total interest paid on school
bonds was $3,643,351, of which $1,504,-
413 was for issues in eastern Washing
ton, and $2,138,938 on the west side.
The east Washington county bonds
paid $439,916, while those of western
Washington paid $1,637,967. The to
tal of school warrant interest was
$1,271,903 ($571,897 east and $700,006
west), while the interest paid on
county warrants was $1,496,847 ($409,-
150 east and $1,087,697 west).
"Whatever of credit may be con
cealed in these aggregate falls to
county government in eastern Wash
ington, inasmuch as the comparative
volume of bonds and warrants in that
geographical section of the state have
paid only 23.75 per cent of the* total
interest on this class of obligations,
while the bond and warrant issues of
the west side counties have paid 76.25
per cent.
"The school indebtedness issues in
eastern Washington, on the other
hand, have paid 42.24 per cent of total
interest penalties as against 57.76 per
cent for the west side."
During those six years, Grays Har
bor county has paid out as interest
on warrants and bonds, including the
school districts, the sum of $299,479.
In the case of county government
and school administration. It is pos
sible to emphasize the charge that
both suffer great waste from want of
proper central control of expenditures.

The natural resources of Grays Har

We all know of our timber, fish and
fertile soil, but the potential wealth
that lies under the soil is as yet
a mystery. We believe there is petro
leum and various valuable mineral
deposits there awaiting the prospec
tor. and Jesse Havens, assistant post
master of Hoquiam. has discovered
north of that city a dposit of what
experts call valuable mineral paint,
which he will endeavor to develop.
Next, Dr. Irving Matthews, also of
Hoquiam, has found that the tide mud
from the Grays Harbor flats makes
an excellent writing ink. The doc

making mud, and is convinced it has
a good commercial value.

A petition signed by residents of
Union Pacific addition, requesting
that an improvement district be form

ABERDEEN, WASHINGTON. THURSDAY, AUGUST 3, 1916.
THE CAUSE AND EFFECT.
Discussion of the working condi
tions of the men employed by the city
to swing its four bridges, and the sal
aries paid them, resulted in the pre
sentation of a lot of figures and statis
tics dealing with the matter, and a
muddle was averted by postponing it
for a week, with instructions given
the finance committee to look into the
controversy and report next week.
Some of the men are working 12 hours
a day, and salaries vary. An effort
is to be made to equalize the differ
ences. Mayor Phillips Is of the opin
ion that 12 hours for 30 days a month,
is too much to expect of city em
ployes. All decisions made in refer
ence to this matter, howevter, are
to be tempered with consideration of
the city's finances.
Steamer Oregon
Launched Monday
New Vessel Qlidea. Into Water Just
Five Month* After Her Keel Was
Laid. South for Machinery
A great crowd of people from all
over Orays Harbor witnessed the suc
cessful launching of the steamer Ore
gon at the Aberdeen Shipyards Mon
day afternoon. Miss Helen M. Wilson
christened the new craft as it slid
gracefully and easily into the Wishkah
river, breaking a bottle of champagne
over the bow as the Oregon touched
the water.
As soon as launched the vessel was
taken over by Captain Otto Sund
man, who will be her skipper. She
will be loaded with lath and towed
to San Francisco to receive the ma
chinery. The completion of the Ore
gon in just five months gives the
Aberdeen Shipyards a reputation for
speed, as well as good work that is
sure to produce results in the future.
The Oregon is of 200 feet at the
light water line, and has an extreme
beam of 41 feet. Her depth of hold
is 14 feet, 8 inches.
As soon aa the Oregon went oft the
ways, the keel was pulled up for the
Phyllis, which 1s being built for Byxby
& Clark, of San Francisco. Her frame
will be constructed inside of 17 days
and the craft is signed for delivery
to its owners on January 1.
The State Bank
Makes Quick Move
The Aberdeen State Bank Moves Into
Quarters Vacated by United
Btates Trust Company
The Aberden State Bank broke the
record for quick moving when the
institution was moved from the quar
ters occupied by it for more than ten
years, at Heron and H streets, to the
elegant room vacated by the United
States Trust company, between the
close of business on Saturday and
Monday morning.
Cashier Ripley closed negotiations
for a lease on the new location Fri
day afternoon, wired President Nyere,
who is visiting in the east, and pro
ceeded to move, and opened up the
bank ready for business on Monday
morning.
flie Aberdeen State Bank is one of
the oldest banks on the Harbor. It
started business on Wishkah street
in the Count Zelasko block, between
H and G streets. The institution,
capitalized at $25,000, now has more
than $260,000 in deposits and these
are showing flattering increases
from month to month. Much of the
credit for this success is accorded
G. L. Nyere, the president, G. W. Rip
ley, the cashier, and R. B. Motherwell,
assistant cashier. The trio is popular
in financial circles and recognized as
men of integrity and ability.

CHAMBER OPENS
NEW QUARTERS
Aberdeen Chamber of Com

ROOM IS WELL ADAPTED
Pres. Bruener Contemplates
a Number of Activities
This Fall and Winter
The Aberdeen Chamber of Com
merce will be e»tabllsed, by the close
of the week, in its new quarters In
the Hotel, Washington. The work of
altering the old buffet of the hi£«l to
suit the requirements of the Chamber
was started Tuesday and, in the ex
pectation of E. A. Morck of the Wash
ington, will be completed by Satur
day.
With the installation of the local
commercial organization's offices tn
the hotel, President T. B. Bruener
is preparing for some active work on
the part of that body. The first of
a series of meetings will be held in
September, at which will come up
for discussion matters of great inter
est to the city and to the Grays
Harbor territory. These meetings
will take the form of public dinners,
and the subject matter for that next
month will be the many initiative and
referendum measures that are to be
submitted to the voters this fall.
The debate on these measures will
be participated in by a number of
speakers, to be named by Mr. Bruener
in advance so that they may prepare
themselves for the discussion. The
speakers, probably, will be limited to
five minutes each, insuring a diversity
of discussion in a short space of
time.
W. C. Mumaw, chairman of the
Chamber committee on agriculture and
logged off lands, is planning for a
big get-together dinner for business
men of Aberdeen and farmers of Grays
Harbor county, in December. This
will be the third annual affair of the
kind to have been arranged by the
Chamber of Commerce and, if it is
as productive of good as the first two,
it will have proven its worth. Mr.
Mumaw, as a matter of fact, is pretty
confident that the meeting this year
will draw a larger crowd and will be
even more interesting than has been
the case at the former two banquets.
The work of rearranging the Hotel
Washington buffet for Chamber quar
ters was carefully planned in advance.
The bar is being moifed Into the
billiard room in the rear and a par
tition will separate the billiard room
from the offices a door being cut into
partition so that members readily may
enter the billiard room if they de
sire to play a game. A door, cut into
the street wall, will give access to
the Chamber room from K street, and
the swinging doors from the hotel lob
by are retained. Signs over the K
street and hotel lobby entrances will
tell strangers where the Chamber of
Commerce is.
In the north end of the Chamber
quarters is the office of Secretary W.
L. Morris. At the south end is a room
for committee meetings. On the west,
or interior wall, running almost its
entire length, is a handsome and mas
sive cabinet for placing of exhibits
of the industries and resources of

Moose Drive Not Herding as Leaders Wish...
Attempt to Deliver Progressives in Elephant
Corral Is failure.
NEW JERSEY REPUDIATES THE BILL OF SALE:
Edgar C. Snyder, Washington State Chairman
of Progressive Party, Hot in Denunciation
of the Chicago Betrayal
NEW YORK, Aug. I.—(Special).—
Efforts to whip the Progressives into
line for Hughes, according to the
Chicago program, have failed.
The stirring scenes at the meeting
of tlie Progressive State Committee
of New Jersey, in Newark, when the
Bull Moose hotly resisted the attempts
of certain leaders to pledge the party
in that state to the Republican ticket,
was a warning that Progressives are
not going to submit to the destruction
of their principles nor to the barter
of their votes.
By a vote of 7 to 5 the state com
mittee of New Jersey Progressives
repudiated the action of the national
body at Chicago, and will not bind
Itself to Its actions.
The managers of the President s
campaign feel that they have every
reason for gratification with respect
to the Bull Moose and Independent
vote. Hundreds of letters and com
munications have been received at the
national committee headquarters, the
headquarters of the Woodrow Wilson
Independent League and at the White
House from Progressives, and Re
publicans as well, who declare their
intention to vote this year for Wi
son, "the man who has kept us out
of war."
New Jeraey Revolt.
The Progressive party of New Jer
sey as represented by its state com
mittee, refuses to indorse the cand
dacy of Charles E. Hughes, although
a strong effort had been put forth by
Everett Colby, a pioneer Progressive
of the state, to swing the committee
that way.
When the meeting of the state com
mittee was held In Newark, July .
J. A. H. Hopkins, chairman, led the
fight against endorsing Mr. Hughes. A
resolution was submitted by Wm - F ;
Conkling, of Blairstown, reciting that
the delegates to the national conven
tion at Chicago had exceeded their
authority by endorsing the candidate
of another party. The resolution
further said:
"Resolved, by the New Jersey state
committee, that the Progressive party
of New Jersey will not be bound by
the action of the national committee
in indorsing Mr. Hughes' candidacy.
This resolution was carried by a
vote of 7 to 5.
Chairman Hopkins read to the com
mittee a letter he had written to Col.
Roosevelt recalling the opinion that
Mr. Hughes might perhaps turn out to
be "another gold brick." This letter
caused much amusement among those
present. 1
Self-Stultification to Go Back Now
For Progressives to go back to the
Republican party now would be self
stultiflcatlon, and would be an admis
sion that they had never been sincere
in their progressive professions, ac
cording to Edgar C. Snyder, chairman
of the Progressive party in the state
of Washington In 1912. Mr. Snyder
is supporting Mr. Wilson because he,
the President, "has given us a pro
gressive leadership and has done much
during the last three years to make
effective the essential demands of the
Progressive party platform."
Mr. Snyder insists that if Mr.
Roosevelt was sincere four years ago
when he said that the bosses and the
special interests had brought the Re
publican party to a shameful end,
then It cannot be expected that the
Progressives can go back now with
out a clear showing that the old par
ty has been purified and has rekindled
within it "that fire of lofty endeavor."
"The control of invisible govern
ment over the machine of the Repub
lican party has never been relaxed,
but has been strengthened and con
firmed," declared Mr. Snyder.
"Wherever the Rpublican party has
cations by the government, trade
pamphlets and all live matter received
by the Chamber that is of interest to
business and professional men and citi
zens generally. This literature it is
hoped citizens will avail themselves
of freely.

been dominant during the last four
years its record of public acts has
been one of retrogression and not of
progress. No better example of this
need be sought than the showing of
our own Republican majority in the
last legislature of this state. The
flagrantly reactionary legislation then
passed would be throttling our liberty
as individual voters and our home
rule powers as self-respecting and
governing communities, if we had not
fortunately possessed the power of
compelling these vicious measures to
be submitted to a vote of the people.
"The Progressive voters are first of
all independent voters. That is why
[they left the old party and that la
why no man and no newspaper organ
and no machine can now deliver their
vote. They think for themselves and
they will deliver their own vote. That
Is why I feel confident that the bulk
of the Progressive vote will in reality
be cast for Woodrow Wilson."
Hanson Challenge* Poindexter.
Ole Hanson, the Progressive leader
in the state of Washington, is very
sincere in his belief that this is not
a time for partisan politics or at
tacks upon the President.
"As American citizens, as Progres
sives, it is our duty at this time to
silence the harsh criticisms and un
thinking partisan prejudices and stand
by our President," said Mr. Hanson
ifi a recent interview.
Mr. Hanson ran for the United
States senatorship in Washington In
Iftfe 'mid polled 88,282 votes. H* is
anxious to engage Senator Miles Poin
dexter, of the same state, in a Joint
debate. Mr. Poindexter was elected to
the senate as a Progressive, but now
says he is.a Republican. The follow
ing is a telegram sent by Mr. Hanson
tc the Democratic national commit
tee;
"We can carry Washington. Can
you shame Senator Poindexter into
debating with me the subject, 'Shall
Wilson Be Returned?' Poindexter is
afraid, and, like Hughes, is a trimmer.
Both have endorsed the American
flag, but refuse to get down to fund*-
mentals. Have challenged Poindexter.
repeatedly, but to no avail."
California Progressive* for Wilson.
Isadore Jacobs, a prominent business
man who is leading the Independent
movement in California, has sent a
communication to the Woodrow Wil
son Independent League, 280 Madison
avenue, New York, in which he gays
that the non-partisan movement Is
just as strong in the northern part
of California as in the southern end
of the state. .y
"Each day," said Mr. Jacobs, "wd
are getting letters from old time Re
publicans and Progressives asserting
that they will work and vote for Wil
son and that it is their purpose to
attend the conference which is to be
held in San Francisco, August 5, and
whoop it up in true western style.
Mr. Jacobs says the majority of th»
Progressives in California will be for
President Wilson. As an indication ot
the type of business men who ere
heading the Wilson Progressive move
ment in California, the following it
quoted from Mr. Jacobs' message:
"A permanent Progressive organize-*
