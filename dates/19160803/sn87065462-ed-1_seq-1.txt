The Court House Election
The election last Thursday to
decide whether or not the people
of the county wanted the court
house moved was quieter than
was expected owing to the tense
feeling existing in the different
parts of the county. So far as
we are able to learn there were
but a few fist fights and none of
them amounted to much.
the result was that the court
house shall remain at Pittsboro.
The vote for removal was 1059
for no-removal 769, giving a ma
jority of 290 for removal. The
law requires two-thirds to move
the county seat. Pittsboro
claims that the removal crowd
needed 1158 additional votes to
move, based on the total regis
tration. The removal crowd
claim they only needed 479 more
votes to move. They also claim
that if 160 of those voting for
no-removal had voted for remov-
al they would have the necessary j
two-thirds and one vote to spare. '
We refrain from giving our ' and he will make good in the po
opinionin of the matter. ; sition to which he aspires if
Below we give the vote of the
several boxes just as it was re-i
ceived. We do not claim these
fitrures to be official, hut are as
accurate as we were able to
tain over the telephone.

Signs Highway Certificate
Gov. Bilbo Monday signed and
sent to Washington a certificate
agreeing to abide by the condi
tions and regulations under
which Mississippi can get
$1,371,000 from the Federal gov
ernment in the next five years
for highway improvements in
the state. The action provides
that when the legislature fs not
in session the governor can
make arrangements to get the
money.
The contributions from the
government is upon condition
that Mississippi spend a like
amount on good roads during
the period of five years. All
highway work in counties and
cities will be credited under con
dition. Meridian Dispatch.
Rush Knox Speaks.
Hon. Rush Knox came into our
town Saturday on the ten o'clock
train and roundeJ up the people
of oar town and addressed them
in the interest of his candidacy
for Supreme Court Judge.
Mr Knox came from the farm
and says that after he had com
pleted his literary education his
father told him that he did not
have the money to carry him
further. This did not stop Mr.
Knox for he went out and raised
peas and corn after he came
from school, keeping "batch"
while doing it, and sold these for
enough to pay his way through lhim e wantg faithfulnegS(
school another year, when he:effid and steadinesS( and
studied law. He says that he is 1 that can only be gecured fc
an ambitious fellow and that his s9lectjng the nm who doeg one
first ambition after completing thinff at a time and doeg jt we
suppose he acquired this ambition
tjm. After a time he succeeded :
in doing this. He wanted to be
District Attorney and secured ;
that position. Now, he wants to j
"go higher" and we believe that j
his chances to go up are good.
There are not many counties in
the state that poll more votes
than ours and we should cast
them all for Mr. Knox and show
just what we can do when we
try.
Reports from other counties,
where Mr. Knox is serving as
District Attorney, are that he
has made good in that capacity
elected. Ecru Enterprise.

Make War on Bandit Weeds
With Mowers.
Free your land from the de
predations of bandit weeds that
rob the soil of its plant food and
steal feed from livestock. These
enemies that are raiding paljr
i i i i i .
ianas can De cleaned out Dy a
relentless war with mowers for
machine guns.
As an instance of the effec
tiveness of the mowing in ex
terminating weeds, Director E.
R. Lloyd, in a recent speech to a
farmers meeting, told of the
successful clearing out of a 300
acre pasture of which about 75
acres were covered with broom
sedge while the rest was over
grown with bitterweed. For
three years this pasture was
mowed twice a year and this
resulted in in the complete des
truction of the broom sage and
only a few straggling bitter
weeds, missed by the mower.
As there was a greatly increased
growth of grasses and clovers
the pasture will now carry a
third more stock than before
the weeds were destroyed. Ac
cording to Director Lloyd, the
mowing not only kills weeds but
makes the grass sweet and ten-
ier and increases its palatability.
vVhen there are mowed patches
in the pasture all classes of live
stock graze there is preference
to any other part of the pasture.
During rainy weather of slack
seasons, the teams and mowers
will return good profits if used
on the pasture.

"It'saFineThjn'
Says Contractor
Felt Tired and Lifeless All the
Time and Couldn't Look After
His Work Properly.
"Tanlac has certainly proved
to be the medicine I needed. It
has done great things for me,
said T. G. Wood, a few days ago.
Mr. Wood is a contractor and
builder of levees. He lives at
Hurlburt, Ark., just across the
river from Memphis, and is well
known in this entire section. He
has just completed a levee
several miles in length for the
U. S. government.
"I had been in a general run
down condition for some time,"
continued Mr. Wood. "I was
also afflicted with rheumatism,
and my hands and joints would
swell so that I could hardly bend
or use them, and the inconveni
ence and suffering was very
severe. I was very nervous at
times and could not sleep and
rest well at night. I had be
come so week and so lifeless
that I hardly had the energy to
move around at all, and would
just have to force myself to
duty.
After reading the strong in
dorsements for Tanlac given by
reliable people, I made up my
mind to try it, and I'm glad to
say that the results have been
most satisfactory to me. I have
just finished taking my second
bottle and'I'm relieved of the
rheumatic pains altogether: that
tired run-down feeling has left
me and I can now properly look ,
after my ' work again. This
medicine seems to have put new
life and energy into me. It is a
fine thing, and I am glad to
recommend it"

Victury ForCardui
Wre are rejoiced at the great
victory won by Z. C. Patten, Jr.,
and the Chattanooga Medicine
Co., at Chicago.
The jury returned a verdict in
favor of the makers of Cardui,
the woman's tonic, and held the
American Medical Journal guilty
of libel for publishing that
Cardui is a nostrum without
merit.
In short, the United States
Court has placed the seal of its
approval upon the remedy Cardui
after one of the most exhaustive
trials in the history of the
country.
All Chattanooga will rejoice,
and the verdict will attract
nation-wide attention. Editorial
