and organized points of support.
Paris today reports this ground
held against a series of German
counter attacks delivered last
night.
Progress by the French in the
Fleury sector, northeast of the
fortress, also is announced, togeth
er with the capture of 1100 Ger
mans in the fighting on the east
bank of the river since August 1.
In the Somme region the Ger
mans have made renewed attempts
to regain the positions they were
forced to give up to the French
in the Monacu farm sector
near the river on Tuesday night.
These failed. Pans declared, and
the new French positions between
Monacu farm and liemwood were
organized by their captor.
Similarly a German attack south
of the Somme, near .Cstress. was
futile.

a result of the heavy losses they have
sustained since July 20.
