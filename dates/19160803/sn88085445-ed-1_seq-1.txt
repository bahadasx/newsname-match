FIRE DEPARTMENT
WANTS AUTO TRUCK
The Lynden Fire Department
wants to buy an automobile fie
truck. At a niee'ing last evening,
the department voted to make a
canvass of the city to provide funds.
Tie genera', committee in charg*
of the campaign is A. A. Baumiin,
chairman, F. F. Nash, and A. ML
Riddle, with the following sub
committees to solicit iv the city:
Western Section, A. A. Bauman, J.
Van Rossutn, and L. Co. by; Center,
A. M. Riddle, Will Bauman, W. Pix
ley: Ea<t, F F. Nash, Everett
Hawley and Dale Huleatt.
A truck to hold all the apparatus
and carry the firemen would enable
the department to rea. h out'yine
districts o-ompily, and would result
in a considerable saving. A nduc
t:on in insurance rates i* also ex
pected as a result. At least $7f<"
will be needed.

Our Public Schools
Should Not Be the
Breeding Places
For Armies
By WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
Statesman
MWWt we abandon our high level of progress, our eminent stand fo;
international arbitration and step down to the brute level of Eu
ropean countries and make out of our schools hothouses and
breeding places for armies? Peace and not war is the normal state of
man. and the teacher must insist on the postponement of any changes
until we can escape the results of actions taken in hot blood or in light
We had no suggestion of making military quarters of our schools two
years ago,
LET US PRAY THAT TWO YEARS HENCE THIS AWFUL FEVER OF
WAR WILL HAVE RUN ITS COURSE AND NO ONE WILL EVER AGAIN
SUGGEST IT.
Is it possible that this nation, that two years ago could not be fright
ened by rich nations full of aHebodied men, can now be frightened by
bankrupt nations filled with cripples?
The people are not likely to favor frontier precautions unless thej
are convinced we must again" face frontier dangers. The "adequate" re
serves asked by one party and the "ample" reserves asked by the other
can be adequately and AMPLY SUPPLIED WITHOUT ROBBING
TnL CRADLE OR RECRUITING IX GRADED SCHOOLS.
I honor the soldier and respect hint in his place. It is no reflection
on the fireman that I advocate and shall continue to advocate the build
ing of fireproof buildings. So I'll go on trying to protect the country
from war, while I respect the soldier who is ready to die when the need
cornea.
But now, when the nations c J Europe are testing out the doctrine*
of war and love, I beseech you as takers to throw your tremendous in
fluence for the ideals of Arner;'~»—tha aVatone of love.

BERRY RETURNS
BEST IN YEARS
Raspberries to the amount of
192.150 pounds have been handled
already this season at the Lynden
Cannery hy H. A. Baker, and fruit
growers of the district have been
paid 16.254.N7 for their product.
T' c season wil' not be over for two
U'ore weeks and it is expected :hat
this amount will be nearly doubled
by ihe c ose.
The berries this year are larger
than usual, and the intermittent
showery weather has enabled the
gathering of tbem without any loss.
Although the growers are only re
ceiving ;> )4 cents a pound for the
product, nevertheless the prompt
ness of the payments, which a't>
made weekly, and the site of ihe
crop, makes the sett ernent ikfct
year more satisfactory than any
season since Robert Heaton ran ibe
cannery.
The fruit is being barrelled, and
is being shipped to Chicago, where
It will be so d to soda fountains and
restauransa for fruit syrups and pits
