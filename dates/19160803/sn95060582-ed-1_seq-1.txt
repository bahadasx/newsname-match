Stick To The Good Man
We need men and women in
publicoffice who cannot be hand
led by any individual or political
organization, and if the people!
want this class of men, they are I
always to be had. If a candidate ,
is up for second term and has
made good, stick to him, but if he
is up for a second term and his
record is bad, don't make the
mistake of believing he has re
formed or will reform if given a
second chance. Ex.
Contract Signed for
School House.
Wednesday the board of trus
tees of the Holbrook school dis
trict signed a contract for the
construction of a new school
house in Holbrook. The Olson
Construction Company, repre
sented by A. F. Miller, secured
the contract and work will be
started as soon as materials can
be placed on the ground.
The bid of the Olson Company
submitted some time ago was
for the completion of the build
ing according to plans previous
ly prepared for the sum S26,000.
This is a larger amount of money
than is now available, and it be
came necessary for the school
board either to have plans drawn
for a smaller building, or to have
the building constructed upon
the original plans and leave its
final completion until mere money
becomes available.
The last named course was the
one adopted by the board of
trustees and the building will be
built, and finished so far as it is
possible to do so with the money
available for that purpose. The
contract calls for the completion
of the work in 140 working days.
