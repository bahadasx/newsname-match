The text r?f the French official statement
given out this afternoon follows:
North of the River Somme we repulsed
last night several German assaults
upon the Monacu farm, and we
organized our new positions between
th*s farm and The Hern wood.
"It has been confirmed that the German
units engaged in the region of the
Monacu farm had to he relieved as a
result of the heavy losses they have
sustained sinle July 30.
".south of the River Somme a counter
attack upon our positions located south
of Estrees failed under our fire.
Fighting Along the Meuse.
On the right bank of the River j
Meuse th?- Germans delivered several j
violent counter attacks upon the |
trenches which we captured yesterday.
Everywhere our curtains of tire and
the fire of our Infantry checked the efforts
of our adversary, who suffered
heavy losses. As for our troops following
up their advantages, they have
made notable progress to the south of
Fleury. They have reached the lmmed:ate
surroundings of this village and
have even gone beyond the railroad
station. The nutib^r of prisoners made
by us yesterday in the region of Fleury
alone is in excess of 700. This raises
to 1,100 the total number of able-bodied
prisoners who have fallen Into our
hands since the first of August on the
right bank of the Aleuse.

! Holding Indignation Meetings f
in Indianapolis to Protest
Against "Crime of 1916."
AIM TO DECIDE UPOft I
HOW TO VOTE THIS FALL
Considering Three Courses, One of 1
Which Is to Indorse the Candidacy
of Woodrow Wilson.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
INDIANAPOLIS, August 3.? s
While notification and ratification r
meetings are the order of the day c
with the democrats and the re- c
publicans, the remnants of the t
shot-to-pieces progressive party p
devote themselves to indignation c
meetings, to protest against the
"crime of 1916," as they term the g
breaking away of their great c
leaders from bull mooserv and \
the indorsement of Hughes by
the progressives' national com-- j:
mittee. Following the revolt s
asrainst that action of bull mno?- (
ers in New Jersey, New York, s
Indiana and Massachusetts, which v
were only state-wide expressions, r
national scope is to be given to the ^
insurrection from the RooseveltPerkins
leadership in a confer- ^
ence being held here today. b
In attendance upon the meeting are a
prominent progressives from nearby
states from the east and the south.
The object is to decide upon a course
of action which will advise the perplexed
and orphaned "bull moose" I
"where to get off" in the November t
elections. In their present plight the .
bull moosers are lacking a herd leader,
perhaps bellwether would be the nap- 1
pier simile since the moose has lost his a
rampant nature and is more lamblike t
than savage.
a
Three Courses Considered. n
Three courses are under consideration 1
in today's conference.
First, to call another national convention
of the progressive party and s
: nominate a candidate for President ei
with John M. Parker of Louisiana for ?
Vice President. d
! Second, to indorse the candidacy of
' Woodrow Wilson. ei
Third, to issue a statement of griev- ^
| ances against the leaders who have v*
gone over to the republicans and leave st
! it to the individual progressives to vote k<
; either the democratic or republican si
ticket, as they see fit.
All these propositions found support- b<
ers among the advance guard who clr- ui
culated in the Hotel Claypool lobby fr
early today. There was no crystalliza- it
tion of sentiment at the outset, the it
conferees feeling the necessity of tak- m
ing counsel among themselves and es- gi
peeially with the eastern contingent tli
upon whom dependence is placed mainly.
h.
Bainbridge Colby of New York and , s<
Matthew Hale of Massachusetts will be b:
looked upon to lead the bewildered w
moose along some path of rational ac- ci
lion, and they in turn are desirous of it]
consulting the views of the men from
the middle west. fr
Bitter Feeline Voiced.
| Mutual condolences over the untime- ^
| ly blow-up of their organization fur- A
nished the principal theme of conver- w
sation prior to assembling. Indigna- th
tion and bitterness of feeling were
voiced in most emphatic terms, and
the ears of Col. Roosevelt and George
\ W. Perkins must have burned thin hi
j morning- si
Several practical considerations had r(
to be taken into account in connection
with the proposition for another naI
tional convention. Kirst was thf quesI
tion of the candidate who would be a re
| figure big enough to command national p.
| respect and attention. John M. Parker ..
is the ideal of such a man, as is Victor
Murdock of Kansas; hut. alas, Murdock
also has dashed forth from the bull
moose can*-brake and is seeking richer PS
pasturage in China. *n

Conference Late in Meeting. ^
Representatives from several ^astern | th
states were late in arriving, and as a j
result the conference, which was set |
for 11 o'clock, was not called to order or
until nearly noon. Balnbridge Colby sj
I of New York announced he was op- ^
j posed to the indorsement of President

! any of the old parties. ! aj
"There is no prearranged program j ?\

am I in favor of indorsing the nomlna- I1
tion of President Wilson. I ti
"What I favor is that in every state j r<
progressive* should vote for electors on i fi
the national ticket as progressives and i ti
| unpledged to any presidential candi- j t*
i date. If by this mea.ns we could elect o
| a material number of -electors, and if 1*
I the outcome should be close between tl
1 Hughes and Wilson, the progressives
! would hold the balance of power in the it
electoral college This is what both of K
! the old parties fear. It is a contingency
| by no means remote, and the plan, if P
; followed, would not only insure con- "
i tinued organization of the progressive
i party, hut would put us in. a position
! of great power and Influence for good." *

UM OF PRESIDENT
TO PREVENT STRIKE
I
l/lay Not Wait on the Referendum
Vote of Railroad
Employes.
BUSINESS MEN EXPRESS
FEAR AS TO THE RESULT (
Vara Executive That Split Between
225 Systems and 400.000 Workers
Will Cause Severe Hardship.
William L. Chambers, commisioner
of the federal board of
nediation and conciliation, was
ailed in by President Wilson tolay
in connection with the
hreatened strike of 400.000 emiloves
of the 225 railway systems
if the country.
The President is anxious to
^et all the information possible
in the situation in order to interene
if a strike seems inevitable.
The mediation board, authorzed
by law to attempt to avert
trikes on railroads, is gathering
acts in* anticipation that the
trike vote now being canvassed
vill favor a walkout and that the
ailroads and their employes will
e unable to reach an agreement.
Yhen this point is reached the
oard expects to be called in to
ttempt to settle the differences.
Crisis Expected Tuesday.
The President has referred to the
department of Labor an appeal from
he Chamber of Commerce of the
nited States for federal Intervention,
'he situation is expected to come to
crisis Tuesday, when the result of
he strike vote will be announced and
npther conference held between the
jpresentatives of the railroads and of
he employes.
The mediation hoard takes the posiion
that nothing of a formal nature
an be done by it until after the re
ult of the vote is known and the
mployers and employes finally fail to
gree." The President, however, is
snsidering whether some extraorinary
actidrfThliy* not be taken.
All the papers relative to the controv*sy
are before the Secretary of Labor,
'iiliam B. Wilson, who. Though on his
ication. is giving this matter his per>nal
and serious consideration and is
eeping in touch by telephone with the
tuation.
There is question as to whether the
>ard of mediation and conciliation,
ider the Xewlands act. withdraws i
om the Labor Department all authory
to act. in railroad controversies, but
is understood that the Labor Departent
officials feel their organic act
ives them scope for whatever offices
ley may exert.
The President is warned that unless ;
? takes prompt action introducing j
>me strong measure of intervention a J
reak is inevitable 'that will cause J
idespread and severe hardship to j
tizens at large and to the business j
iterests of the entire country.
Because the railroads refuse to budge j
om their attitude and the brother- >
>ods of employes will not recede from ]
leir demands, this appeal to the Presi- j
?nt is marie by the Chamber of Com
erce of the United States, with Henry
. Wheeler of Chicago as spokesman,
ho is chairman of the committee on
le railroad situation for the chamber.
Big Hearing Planned.
How serious the thousands of leading
isiness organizations consider the j
tuation is shown by the fact that al- j
:ady they are planning for a big 1
taring In Washington, probably early j
lis month, at which will appear rep- j
isentatives of practically every imartant
commercial body in the
nired States, to present the interests
' the shippers and the public.
This conference is to be called, if necisary,
to impress upon Congress the
rcperative need for immediate action
? prevent a giant strike.
Copies of the appeal to the President
ive been sent to the representatives of j
e railroads, the four brotherhoods, i
aairman Newlands of the Senate com- j
Ittee on interstate commerce and Chair- ;
an Adamson of trie House committee I
1 interstate and foreign commerce. A
ecial message has been addressed to j
1 urging steps be taken to insure in- i
rvention as assured in the resolution re- i
ntly introduced by Senator Newlands !
id ratified by an almost unanimous vote i
the commercial organizations affiliated
ith the Chamber of Commerce of the j
nited States. Chairman Wheeler de- j
ares it may be imperative to call a (
inference in Washington in the near fuire
where the interests of the shipper I
id the general public can be so far ad- I
sed as to impress Congress with the '
icessity of immediate action. This !
ould he attended by representatives of j
-Rctically every important commercial '
>dy in the United States?all the mem
rs of the national chamber. j
Settlement Believed Remo\i.
"As chairman of the national chamber '
immittee on the railroad situation I
iet in New York with the railway j
icecutive advisory committee, Frank j
Trumbull, chairman, and the naonal
conference committee of raildads,
Elisha I>ee, chairman, to request
rom them a definite statement as to
le position of the roads when the conerence
reconvenes to hear the result
f the strike vote, which was completed
ist week." Chairman Wheeler wrote to
ie President.
'There seems to be a prevailing opin>n
in Washington, and I think rathejr
enerally held throughout the country,
^at no interruption of freight transortation
will result and that some
leans will be found to adjust the diferences.
"As a result of the meeting my conictlon
is deepened that an amicable
ettlement is remote and that while
ther orderly steps are yet to be taken
efore a final break is reached, yet
uch a break is inevitable unless strong
leasures of intervention are speedily
ltroduced.
"On August 8 the joint conference
rill convene again, the men will anounce
the result of their strike vote,
nd the roads will reiterate their proosals
which the brotherhood chiefs
ave once declined. 1 am assured that
lere will be no modification of the attude

When the Break Will Come.
"The United States board of mediation
and conciliation may come into the
matter at this point, but without effect,
in my judgment, in bringing these contending
factions together. Finally, ar- j
bitration may he discussed, and the
break will come when the roads absolutely
refuse to arbitrate only the demands
of the men and the men refuse
with equal force to admit into the. arbitrations
the contingent proposals of
the roads.
"Thus, unless there is intervention, as P
proposed in Senate joint resolution 145, tl
ratified by an almost unanimous vote of U
the commercial bodies affiliated with s
the Chamber of Commerce of the United b
States, or other governmental interven- n
tion on behalf of the public, nothing d
will be left but for the men indefinitely F
to defer action or exercise the author- tl
ity conferred upon them by an over- a
whelming vote to call a strike.
"In the meeting the roads definitely io
expressed a determination riot to re- ^
cede from their present position no n
matter from what source an appeal is e
made, arid while I am usually optlmis- e
tic about finding a way out of difficult Cl
situations. 1 must confess In this situation,
after talking most earnestly
with both parties to the controversy, 1
see no ray "of light nor any possibility *
of averting a serious catastrophe." ^
Purpose of Conference. (.
Chairman Wheeler, in submitting the 1
copy of the letter sent to President h
Wilson to the four chairmen of the a
brotherhoods, said the conference with a
the railroad interems In New York was *4
for the purpose of securing a definite ^
statement as to the possible comnrnmisf.
of th?? differences existine: be- I _
tweon the roads and the brotherhoods, j I
"Our communication to the Presi- ? I
dent,'' Mr. Wheeler Roes on, address- |
ing the brotherhood heads, "endeavors
clearly to reflect the gravity of the situation
as we see it. We hope we are
wrong; but with the passing days we g
have found no reason to change the
form originally expressed by our committee
that the public interest is a
definite and tangible third interest in
this controversy, and that the public
have a right to know whether any increase
in cost of operation arising
from an adjustment of the differences
between the brotherhoods arid the railroads
is to be passed on for final pay- fi
ment by an increase in rates for transportation."

to Eliminate Declaration of
Value on Baggage.
That bane of the railroad traveler,
"the Cummins amendment.'* under
which every one who checks a trunk
at a railroad station has to sign
separate declaration of value for each
article of baggage forwarded, has had 1
the sting taken from it by both houses i
of Congress now. and all that remains j
for the President's signature to be in j
order on the amending act is a conference
between Senate and House of
Representatives over several minor
differences between the two bodies. The
House passed a bill late yesterday
amending the original liability act. The
Senate already had passed it.
Ever since the so-called Cummins
amendment has been effective travelers
have been confronted in railroad
stations by huge signs directing attention
to the "amendment" and the necessity
of standing in line to sign a
pink or a blue or a green or a white
slip, according to the railroad to be
traveled on.
Made Travelers Miss Trains.
The matter got to he a sore point with
commercial men, and more than one inexperienced
traveler has missed trains
in the efforts necessitated under the law.
As an additional inconvenience to traveling,
the Cummins amendment probably
would be given first prize.
As explained by Representative Esch of
Wisconsin, ranking republican on the
interstate and foreign commerce committee;
"The amendment was slipped in on the
Senate side March 4, 1915, near the minute
of the final adjournment of Congress.
a lie uiu was inai wnicn reiuses 10 anow
railroads to limit the liability for loss
upon goods and livestock carried on their
lines. The original intention did not
cover personal baggage, but these words
were deftly slipped into the bill in some
manner, 'provided, however, that if the
goods are hidden from view by wrapping,
boxing or other means and the carrier is
not notified as to the character of the
goods the carrier may require the shipper
to specifically state in writing the value
of the goods and the carrier shall not be
liable beyond the amount so specifically
stated, et^
"Reading that over you will see that
personal baggage is perfectly well covered.
Whether intended or not, the
travelers of the country have been put
to much inconvenience, loss of time and
so forth."
X. C. C. Never Favored Law.
While not officially stated, members
of Congress say that the interstate
commerce commission never was in
favor of this so-called "Cummins
amendment" and that possibly one reason
for the strict enforcement of the
law by the railroads is because of a desire
to direct attention to the extreme
undesirability of the law.
The. law, as it will be amended, now
that the Senate and House have passed
the amendatory bill, expressly specifies
that the liability law "shall not apply
first to baggage carried on passenger
trains or boats." This act is made more
specific as to what it really means to
cover; and livestock is specified as of
prime importance. Railroads will be
required to be liable for livestock
shipped over their routes. It is a far
cry from a herd of cattle to a woman's
trunk shipped over a railroad, and the
Congress of the United States now is in
process of declaring that it recognizes
the difference.

Former Knight Pays Penalty I

PRISON BELL IS TOLLED I
AS BARBER SPRINGS TRAP
Goes to Scaffold Calmly as Little !
Group of Irishmen Outside
Pray Amid Jeers.
LONDON, August 3.?Roger
Casement, former British knight 1
and consul, was hanged at 9 i
o'clock this morning in Penton- t
ville jail for high treason. He (
was convicted of conspiring to
cause an armed revolt in Ireland 1
and with having sought Gorman <
aid to that end.O"
Two hours before the execu- <
tion a crowd of men, women and !
children gathered before the prison
gates. Twenty minutes before i
Casement mounted the scaffold f
the great prison bell commenced 1
to toll. The sound was greeted
with cheers from the crowd, 1
mingled with some groans. At I
9 o'clock the crowd had swollen ;
to such proportions that it extended
for two blocks from the
prison front. At one minute '
after 9 a single stroke of the big <
bell announced that the trap had (
been sprung. It was the signal i
for a mocking, jeering yell from ]
the crowd, which suddenly died i
away into dead silence.
Went to His Death Calmly. 1
Casement met his death with calm i
courage, JIVXUI UIUB '?
Early in the morning: two priests of 1
the Roman Catholic Church adminis
tered the last rites in the cell of the
condemned man. and shortly afterward
a little procession, headed by the
clergymen, with Casement following,
a warden on either side, proceeded to
the execution shed, only five yards
away. The priests recited the litany
of the dying. Casement responding in
low tones: "Lord have mercy on my
soul."
As the party reached the shed where
the gallows was erected the special
executioner, a hairdresser named
Ellis, approached Casement and quickly
pinioned him. The two chaplains, the
under sheriff of I>ondon and the under
sheriff of Middlesex then took up their
positions in front of the scaffold. Case- |
ment mounted the gallows steps firmly
and commended his spirit to God as he
stepped on the trap. A moment later
the lever was pulled.
Immediately after the trap was
sprung the prison engineer and physician
descended into the pit, where,
after the application of the usual tests.
| Casement was pronounced dead at nine
minutes after nine. According to the
custom in the case of prisoners hanged
for crimes similar to that of Casement.
his body will be buried in quicklime
in the prison yard, but probably
no decision as to the burial will be
made until after the inquest.
Pray While Crowd Jeers.
An affecting incident took place outside
the prison wall as the execution
was in progress. At the back of the
prison, a little distance from the jeering
crowd about the gates, was a n
group of about thirty Irish men and t
wnm^n U'hpn th?? dull clanir r>f thA V
prison bell announced that the doomed t
man had paid the last penalty this little n
group fell on their knees, and with e
bowed neads remained for some moments,
silently praying for the repose
of the soul of their dead fellow-countryman.
Immediately after the execution p
three notices were posted on the prison t
door. The first, signed by the undersheriff
of London, the governor of the ?
prison and Father James McCarrell. o
Casement's confessor, read: "Judgment w
of death was this day executed on
Roger David Casement in his majesty's v
prison of Pentonville in our presence." c
A similar notice was signed by the .
undersheriff of Middlesex county. The
third bore the name of P. R. Mander. c
the prison surgeon, who certified that s;
he had examined the body of Casement
and found life extinct.
A coroner's jury found that the sen- si
tence had been carried out in accord- fl

who appeared in behalf of relatives, s1
ideni ifled the body. a
At the inquest the governor of the pris- | 01
on and the chief warden testified that tJ
death was instantaneous. tJ
Dr. Mander was asked by Solicitor p,
Duffy whether there was any truth in the
statement published that Casement had
been insane. He replied:
"I saw no evidence of insanity. He
acted in a sane manner to the end." .
Replying to a question by the coroner.
Solicitor Duffy said that Case- ment's
health at times was very bad. n
He made a plea that the body be hand- ^
ed over to relatives, which the author!- "
ties, he said, had refused. The coro- b
ner declared he had no power to inter- s\
fere, whereupon Duffy protested, saying
it was a "monstrous act of lnde- n
cency that the authorities should refuse tl
the request."
Ellis, the executioner, arrived in the
prition early last evening and immediately B
made his preparations. He examined the O
trapdoor In the execution shed and tested L.
it thoroughly with a bag exactly the same tc
weight as Casement's. Ellis remained in 1.

Urges 14th Street Project.
When the District bill was taken up
for consideration today Senator Marine
of New Jersey moved that the Senite
committee amendment striking out
he House provision for the widening
n I4tn street norinwest oeiween Pennsylvania
avenue and F street and pavng
It with asphalt be not agreed to.
Senator Martine insisted there was no
rood reason why this street should not
>e ap wide in this block as in the two
blocks north and south of it.
Objection was made, he said, by the
S'ew Wlllard Hotel to the widening of
he street. He said that the hotel had
ellars under the sidewalk which it
ised without paying any rent to the
district. The properties on both sides.

vere owned by the Willard estate, and
le saw no reason why the interests of
he general public should be set aside
or these millionaires.
Senator Shafroth defended tho action
f the Senate committee in striking out
he House provision. He said there
Fas no need for widening the street,
hat owing to its steep grade in this
lock it was not used much, and would
ot be suitable for parking automobiles
ven if it was widened.
Sees Danger in Asphalt.
It would be a mistake, he said, to
ave the street with asphalt instead of
he Belgian blocks which now cover it,
ince it would make the street dangerus
for horses and for automobiles in
ret weather. He said, too, that the
nilard Hotel would lose $28,000 beause
of the proposed interference with
he cellars now used by it and by it
onstructed under the sidewalks. Hef
aid that he saw no good reason for
ompelling the hotel to lose this money
Ince it was not necessary for the benet
of the public to widen this street.
He said there were a hundred other
laces where business houses used the
treets in this way. and he did not see
ny reason for disrrimin4Ung in this
ne case. A general law woviding for

9 to 23. refused to agree to the comlittee
amendment striking out the
[ouse provision widening ]4th street
etween Pennsylvania avenue and F
treet northwest to seventy feet, thus
taking it conform with the rest of

Senator Smoot of Utah then offered
n amendment providing that after
ctober 1. 1916. the Georgetown Gas
ight Company should not be permitted

000 feet of gas. He explained that
lis was in line with the amendment
lopted yesterday reducing the price
' gas in Washington city to 75 cents,
he present price of gas in Georgeiwn,
he said, is $1.
There was reason, he said, that the
Ice should be somewhat higher in
eorgetown than In Washington; the
ant is smaller and the field served
smaller. But, he said, there was no
tasen why this difference should
