Russians I f ftaged by Victories Pay No Heed to Natural
ObstacicaJut Drive Steadily Ahead-Kovel Only Twelve
Miles Away and Lemherg in Danger-May Turn Flanks
of Teuton Armies-Little Changes Made on Western
Front But Fighting Is Fierce
Petrograd, Aug. 3. The battering of Teuton defenses
along the Kovel-Lemberg line showed no signs of abate
ment today. Unofficial dispatches from the front said
the Russian forces were mixing infantry attacks with
heavy artillery bombardment in a series of battles at var
ious pomts. , German counter attacks in rapid succession
are being launched against the Muscovite columns, so far
without success, except temporarily halting the forward
movement of the Russians.
Press dispatches today said General Kaledine was less
than a dozen miles from Kovel and continuing his ad
vance. He is threatening momentarily to take the Kovel
Lemberg railway, spreading still wider the Russian
wedge between the German and Austrian forces. This
same wedge threatens a turning of the flanks of the two
Teutonfc armies.
Marshy terrain is hampering the Russian attacks
slightly, but the czar's forces are so confident of early
victory and so encouraged by the success which has so far
attended their drive that they are disdainful of natural
obstructions.
German Story of Day.
Berlin, Aug. 3. Both British and
French atta.'ks on the western front
yesterday failed, according to today's
war office statement.
"Strong English attacks on both
sides of the Aluert-Bapnume rond east

ed. "French advances near Bnrleaux
and Estrees were repulsed."
"Between Maurepas and the Somme
seven French assaults were made," the
communique continued. "We remained
masters of our positions after stubborn
fighting. The enemy only succeeded In
penetrating to Monncu farm, also a
trench section north of that point. ;
"At the Thiaumont work, southeast
of Fleury the enemy was completely re
pulsed, likewise in the mountain and
forest nearby, after temporarily break
ing our lines. They suffered heavy
Josses. The enemy obtained a footing
on Pepper ridge, southwest of Fleury
and they recaptured a trench section
lost Tuesday in Laufee forest.
"On the eastern front Russian ad
vances on both sides of Lake Nobel
failed. Southwest of Lubieszew a strong
attack broke down. An enemv advance
around Kowelsnrnyry was driven off."
As the French Tell It.

CASEMENT WALKS
CALMLY TO DEATH
AND D1E8 BRAVELY
Aided Executioner In Adjust
ing Noose and Pinion
ing Anns
"I DIE FOR MY COUNTRY"
WERE HIS LAST WORDS
Ignoble Ending of Life Filled
with Work for Good of
Humanity
London, Aug. 3 Roger Casement paid
penalty for treason today with his life.
He was hanged at Peutonville prison
at 9:07 a. lit. today. Ten minutes later
his body was cut down, life being pro
nounced extiuct.
. The Irish leader's last words, spoken
while he waited fearlessly for the drop
to be sprung were:
"I die for my country."
The Rochdale barber, Ellis, the pris
on's regular executioner, sprung the
drop after he had adjusted the hempen
noose not tho silken cord which the
former knight had hoped up to n few
weeks ago would be granted as his in
strument of death, in accordance with
the ancient privilege granted men of
his title. '
The hanging was witnessed only by
officials of the prison. A large crowd
waited outside the grim goal and when
the bell tolled announcing the law's
satisfaction there were a few cheers In
termixed with groans. Several Irish wo
men standing at the rear of the Benton
ville jail attempted a demonstration,
led by an Irish member of parliament,
but were quickly hustled off the scene
by guards.
It was said Casement went" calmly
to his death, led by a Catholic priest
who ministered to him when he retired
last night for the last time at 10:30 and
when he arose nearly today. The Irish
leader has only been recently converted
to Catholicism.
Two Catholic priests. Fathers Ring
and Carey, beard Casement's last con
fession and administered holy commun
ion to the condemned man. Both ac
companied him to the scaffold.
Smiled at His Guards.
Leaving his cell on the summons to
death, the Irishman, appeared slightly
nervous, but there were no signs of a
breakdown and he smiled gravely at his
guard, remarking: "It is a beautiful
morning."
Several of the Irishmen In the crowd
outside the jail fell on their knees and
prayed fervently during the tolling of
the bell which announced Casement's
death. On the other hand there were a
few in the watchers, men and women,
who waved hats and handkerchiefs.
Last night guards said Cnsement
spent considerable time in writing, but
slept soundly after he had retired.
l.asement expected a reprieve and
commutation of his sentence uiwto last

aud without emotion went about setting
uis nttairs in orucr.
Those who witnessed the hanging said
the Irishman was master of himself,
walkiugk to deuth and waiting for the
noose to tighten. When the priest re
cited the prayers for the. dead, Case
ment responded in a clear voice: "Lord
have mercy on my soul."
Casement was granted just one boon
before his death and that was per
mission to wear his own clothes iistend
of the prison garb to which he objected
strongly on his incarceration iu the con
demned cell. He did not wear a collar.
Ho assisted the executioner in adjusting
the noose and pinioning his arms and
legs.
Brief Story of Offense,
The government turned a deaf ear to
all picas for commutation of the de
graded knights sentence. Petitions
have been coming in at the home office
for weeks. It was in ancwer to these
that Lord Robert Cecil asserted that no
doubt existed as to the Irishman's guilt
and that the only ground on which com
mutation could be based would be po
litical expediency a "difficult ground
to put forth in this country."
Solicitor Oavin Duffy, who was Case
ment ' counsel, was indignant at refusal
of the prison authorities imemdiatcly
to turn over the body of the Irish
knight after the law had been satis-
fied.''
" Representing deceased relatives at
the inquest," he said, "I applied to the
home office for possession of the body.
Their refusal to turn it over to me was
a monstrous act of indecency."
Prison liovernor uavis testified at
the inquest that Casement's death was
instaaetneous.
The then Sir Roger Casement was ar
rested on April 22 after having landed
on the Irish coast from a German sub
marine which wa convoying a German
tramp steamer loaded with arms and
ammunition for : Irish revolutionists.
Two days later the Dublin revolt brokt
out.
The Irish knight was taken to Lot-

GOODBYE
E
Submersion Was Made About
One Mile Outside of
the Capes
UP TO WATCHING FLEET
TO CATCH HER IF IT CAN
Last Act of Captain and Crew
Was "Three Cheers for
America"
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Norfolk, Vn., Aug. 3. Somewhere in
the direction of Germany, safely past
the allied warship patrol, the submarine
merchantman Deutsohland is boring her
way through the Atlantic toward her
home port of Bremen. Reports coming
into Hampton Ronds indicate the pion
eer submarine blockade runner has not
poked her periscope above the water
since she submerged near the capes last
night. At that time tho nearest British
warship was fivo miles distant, accord
ing to the tug Thomas F. Timmins,
winch accompanied the Deutschland as
far as the capes.
.Expectation of a thrilling chase and
perhups some sort of a fight in con
nection with tho Deutschland 's depar
ture was disappointed. Folks on slioro
saw nothing nnd Bight seers who filled
big and little hurbor craft saw little
more.
From Cape Henry came tho word long
after Bunrise that no sign had been
seen of the Deutschland. A single dis
appointed Briti-sb dog of war lay off
Cnpe Henry light and not" ne.other ves
sel was In sight. . .
Conditions Favored watcher.
Weather conditions favor the allied
patrol, however, not the Deutschland.
The cnpe observer reports a clear sky
and only a slight breeze.
The . submarine's actual Bubmersion
was witnessed only by her pilot tug, the
Timmins, and those aboard the Timmins
were not close enough to be sure they
had seen the dive made until wave aft
er wave of the heavy sea had come up
aud gone down without the submarine's
light again showing.
The submersion was made about a
mile outside the capes, the Timmins"
crew reported when they put into Nor
folk early today.
Captain Uinscb, or too interned Uer-
man liner Neckar, who was aboard the
Timmins, said the last act of Captain
Koenig and his crew before they went
below was to give three cheers for
America and the American people. This
was as they neared the capes. Then
all disappeared from the upper struc
ture of the submarine, Captain Koenig
Being last to descend, shouting a fare
well to Captain Hinsch as lie disap
peared. Captain llinscn said tho Ueutschlnnd
planned to submerge only during the
duy time when well out to sea and in
the duy time only when absolutely
necessary.
She will proceed on too surtace like
any other vessel at night us soon as out
of the danger zone," he said.
"We expect to hear from her or
nbout her before she reaches Bre
men."
"That's tho last that hill bo seen of
her until she bobs up in Bremen," de
clared Captain Hinsch.
Captain Zach Cullison, of tho Tim
mins, would only soy: "I'm glad she's!
gone."
It's the most worrysomo bit of pilot
Captain Zach has had to handle iu many
a duy.
May Work Along Coast
It tins been understood Captain Koe
nig planned to work his way along
the coast, north or south after submerg
ing, putting into some, port if forced to
do so by the enemy patrol. He desired
to dive out into the Atlantic, the mo
ment he was sure the patrol had been
avoided.
The United States cruiser North
Carolina, assigned to neutrality duty,
was ordered in from the capes today,
indicating the belief of government of
ficials at least, 'that danger of neutral
ity violation bad passed.
The Deutschland appeared in the bay,
after spending the day in Tangier
Sound, 35 miles up, just about sunset
and was cutting across toward the capes
an darkness began to full. She was
displaying rTH and green lights close
to the water, but soon put these out.
Approaching the cape sentry lightship
the submarine moved in close to shore
and held back while the Timmins pro
ceeded some distance out, presumably
to determine if hostile vessels were in
sight. Presently she signaled and the
Deutschland moved on past the cape.
This was abont 9 o'clock.
The Dentschlaud drew near enough
to her pilot tug to permit the shouting
of farewells and the cheering for Amer
ica and then the rolling water began to
pile up between them. She signaled
briefly with her periscope light. Then
that blinked out and the tug turned
back to Norfolk.

Total operations in the greater num

the best part of the day price move

Transactions of the professional cle

in the cotton and wheat markets served
to restrain speculative business in
securities .for the good reason tlyit the

At times trading came almost to a

transacted confined to a few issues, in

were decidedly weak on pressure from

The problem of feeding the

General Pershing's column sup-
plied would assume serious pro-

By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)'
Washington, Aug. 3. A problem,
tremendously dangerous in both its
economic and political aspects" faces
President Wilson in the threatened
strike of 400,000 railroad trainmen, ac
cording to administration circles to
day. The matter la now directly befora
the president in form of a letter from
Chairman Harry A. Wheeler of the rail
way committee of the United Statea
chamber of commerce. The latter urges
an "inquiry on behulf of. the adminis
tration" to investigate the Impending
crisis. Scores of informal requests for
action also have been received.
However, until the trainmen's strike
vote is counted expected August 7
the president probably will decide no)
course of action. .
From an economic standpoint, the
strike, if called, would assume cataclys
mic proportions, in the belief of offici
als here. It would completely tie up
freight traffic throughout the country,
halting grain shipments, food aud sup
plies of all kinds to an extent aud with
results impossible to forecast.
The smaller towns would suffer most,
it is believed particularly which tboso
are not self-supporting or within a ter
ritory supplying food. Mining towns,
where supplies for only two or thre
days are kept, would be in immediate)
duuger of starvation or complete busi
ness collapse as its people left for oili
er points. Losses, according to go
eminent officials, would mount into
hundreds of millions of dollars.
From a political standpoint, the presi
dent's position in attempting to bring
nbout an adjustment oi tho difficulty,
is "full of dynamite," according to hia
advisors.
The trainmen say they won't arbi
trate and the railroads say they won't
yield. Should the president, by shirt
slcevo diplomacy, demand arbitration,
he would faco resentment of several
hundred thousand laboring men.
If he fails to bring about arbitration
or a settlement, he will find himself
faced by a paralysed transportation sys
tem resulting in tremendous business
confusion and vast suffering.
Hence, friendB of the president nr
hoping and praying that when the exec
utive board of the "big four' brother
hoods and the general conference com
mittee of the railroads resume confer
ences in New York, August 8, they may
come to some satisfactory agrcoment.
Administration officiuls, representa
tives of the railroads and labor, how
ever, ore pessimistic over possible agree
ment at that conference. The presi
dent is being kept informed promptly
of every move in the threatened criaia.
When the vote of the trainmen Is count
fd and it is aosumed it will favor a
utfike tho United States board of m
diation and conciliation will at once ot
