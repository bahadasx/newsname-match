FLORIDA WAS THE
HOME OF MAN IN
THE EARLY AGES
As Shown by Recently Unearthed
Prehistoric Remains .
HUMAN BONES WERE FOUND
Deposits Contain Also Fossils of
Animals Different From Those
Living Now in this Country
Pleoistocene Geologic Period
By some very important dis
coveries made during the past
year, an announcement of which
is made by Dr. E. II Scllards, state
geologist, in the July issue of the
American Journal of Science, it is
Known that Florida has been the
home of man for a much longer
geologic period than has hereto
fore been suspected.
These discoveries include the
finds of human bones and imple
ments which are much older than
' any such relics found in America.
The human relics were found at
Vero in St. Lucie county and came
i to light as the result of the con-
f struction of a drainage canal
; made by the Indian River Farms
Company The fossils are found
; in the banks of the canal and be
long, according to the state geolo-
; -gist, to the geologic period known
' as the Pleistocene.
The first human bones at VeroJ
were found by Frank Ayers in
. October 1915, and subsequent dis
coveries were made by Air .Ayers,
4i Ossac M. Wcills and Dr. E. II.
; Sellards in April, 1916.
, Not only are human bones found
. at this place, but in addition the
deposits contain also the remains
' of many of the animals living at
that time, which were very differ
ent from those living now in the
United States. Among the
strange animals then living in
Florida, as shown by their fossil
remains imbedded in this forma
tion, were elephants, mastodons,
three different kinds of horses,
. extinct bison, -camels, peccaries,
tapirs, very large cloths, wolves,
and. saber- tooth tigers. With the
exception of the , horses which
have been reintroduced into A-
merica from Europe and bison
which are native to North Ameri
ca, the nearest relatives of these
species are now found in Central
or South America, in Asia or in
Africa.- v .. -
It is the fortunate preservation
of the fossilized bones of these an
imals that enables the state polo
.Mst to determine the age of the
formation which contains the hu
man relics. The time interval
-since these animals were living in
America is believed by geologists
to be not less than from 10,000 to
25,000 years. All the important
material that is necessary to prove
this discovery is in the state col
lection at Talllahassee.
The importance that is attached
to this discovery by scientists is
indicated by the fact that the A
merican Journal of Science, .the
oldest and one of the best estab
lished scientific magazines in A
merica, uses Dr. Sellard's an
nouncement as the leading article
tor the July issue. These discover
ies in fact include the most valu
able addition to the history of
the human race that has been
made in the Western Hemisphere.
Several Exchanges.
Cleanliness And Disease
Be clean if yoH would be
healthy! '
This is one of the command
ments of the Gospel of the modern
sanitarian. It is the basic founda
tion on which rests all the laws
and rules under which the up-to-date
physician makes hid
fight for the physical wel
fare of his patients. It is
the most often repeated and the
most emphasized of the orders
that he issues to his clients.for he
knows that recovery from disease
and from wounds and the preser
vation of normal health conditions
are next to impossible in the pres
once' of uncleanliness. .
In the fight against infantile pa
ralysis, which-is occupying the
most strenuous attention of the
medical profession in the United
States, this law has assjmed a
new anxl added significance. Ad
mittedly, the disease is still very
much of a mystery in its origin,
its progress and methods of devel
opment and as to the most effec
tive treatment, but from their ob
servation, the medical men of the
country agree that its virulence is
greater in the midst ol.unnygienic
surroundings than under those
where care is taken to create and
preserve the proper conditions of
clean living.
In this respect the disease follows
exactly in line of all aflhctions
that are known to be of germ ori
gin, indeed, of all physical de
rangements to which humans are
the legitimate heirs.
There is no better preventative
against disease than proper hy
giene, none more essential, and
the temperature of summer,
whether in the North or the South,
calls for extraordinary precau
tions in this direction. The reason
is that putraf action and decay are
more rapid, as is all chemical re
action, under heat than under the
lower temperatures of the cooler
season. The breeding of flies and
mosquitoes, the carriers of disease
producing germs, is favored by
summer heat, whether it ' be in
Florida or in Maine.
It is only natural that under the
stress of emergency particular at
tention should be given to clean
ing up the premises, to the prompt
and regular removal of refuse, but
here '8 something to remember
The influence of unclean physical
surroundings, like that of moral
uncleanliness, is not immediately
cut off by sudden reformation. It
remains for a time to produce evil
results in spite of improved sur-i
roundings. Our bodies, like our
souls, must be rid of the poison of
evil before they can absorb the)
full value of hcathful surround
ings. ' -
It follows that we should al
ways be in a state of preparedness
against disease of every nature,
mainly by t he preservation of nor
mal hygienic conditions, by habits
of regular eating, bathing- and
clothing adapted to the personal
occupation, by plenty of sleep and
by indulgence in no form of ex
cess. Persons who acquire and
follow habits of regular normal
living, unpunctuated, by oven oc
casional riots of excess, are best
armed against disease, even
though they may be surrounded
by unhygienic conditions, but e
ven such arc subject to the poison
of dirt, and no one is reasonably
safe unless he is armed by person
al cleanliness and by uncontami
nated surroundings.
In the conditions that have a
possible menace for -Florida dur
ing the present summer, the mat
ter of proper personal hygiene and
circumstances is of the utmost im
portance, and by, preserving such
conditions the people of Florida
can most effectively aid the health
authorities in their fight against
invasion by infantile paralysis.

No Market For Them
The News receives nearly every
week, letters and phone messages
asking about the sale of v&kh,
newspapers, brass, etc. At the
present time, we know of no mar
ket where such waste products
can be sold at a profit. The price
offered for them is so little that it
docs not pay to gather and ship
them . The freight rates eat up the
entire returns.
If the people of Jacksonville or
some other central point would
get together and establish a paper
mill, there might be a market for
the thousands of tons of old news
papers, magazines, rags, etc., now
going to waste in Florida. But
in Florida we are all so intent on
securing tourists and arranging
for their pleasure, that we have
little or no time to arrange for and
encourage factories and farmers.

Deserved sarcasm from Times

if ever the educational institu

cally unknown to the average col

While the people of other states, ven though their electric fans be

cities are sweltering and suffering
and many are dying as a result ot
the excessive heat wave that U
sweeping over the country, wo of
South Florida are enjoying a peri
od of unusually delightful weath
er, with moderate temperatures
during the day time and fall like
breezes in the night. The best of
it all is that in this region we 'are
not affi'cted by the humidity lhat
is pravelent elsewhere during the
summer season, the reason Ave are
not affected being because wo do
not have the humidity. We can
not help regretting to learn of the
deaths that follow those terrific
heat waves, but we can do no more
than point the havens of safety
from such conditions and invite
the people to come . here where
such things do not occur. Fort

of the bridge across Peace river

The following resolution was
adopted :
AVhereas, Chapter 6932, general
acts of the legislature of Florida,
of 1915, provides that each bank
in which county funds are depos
ited, give a surety bond or depos
;t state county or county commis
sioner's as collateral for such de
posits: therefore,
ern cities summer nights are
nightmares. In Florida the weary
workman lays him down to pleas
ant dreams and wakens refreshed.
The native Floridian knows
nothing of the horror of northern
people who are tortured out of
their rest by sweltering heat as
the weary hours of the night drag
on.
The cool inshore breezes from
the gulf not only make the cli
mate of Florida one of its great
est drawing cards in the . winter
but prevents extremes of heat in
the summer.. Simply to read the
reports of the suffering of north
ern people from cold in the winter
and heat in the summer should
forcibly remind all Floridians of
the blessing they enjoy in climate.
In Chicago Friday twenty-three
people were killed by the heat and
more than fifty were prostrated.
In Florida such a thing as heat
prostration is unkimwn.
It is strange but true thatmcst
northern people entertain the o-l
pinion that it is extremely hot in
Florida during- the summer
months. Without consulting tern
perature records of the weather
bureau they simply jump at the
conclusion that it must be hot as
blazes in Florida because Florida
is nearer the equator than their
home states.
Florida boosters in the north
can always put in to good advan
tage any time they have to spare
in talking by correcting the false
impression of high temperatures
in this state in the summer. Pen

Does an orange grove pay?
This is a question that is frequent

people are unable to give a
thoroughly satisfactory answer.
In a general way, they will either
attempt to answer in the afhirma

to them), but without anything
practical, concrete or specific in
the way of arguments.
The following is ah answer both
practical and concrete, as well as
specific :
