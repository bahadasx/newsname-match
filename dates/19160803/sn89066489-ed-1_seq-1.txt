NOTE The consolidated vote for
Mrs. Nell Thompson were dele'
gates to the county convention of
the W. C. T. U. at Rich Hill the
26th and 27th. Mrs. E. G. Em
mons of Mexico, Mo., state organ
izer and lecturer, was a great help
during the day sessions and made
a fine address in,the park at 8 p.
m. The time was spent pleasantly
and profitably by all who attend
ed the convention. But it was
with sorrow they adjourned at 2
pvm. Thursday to attend the
funeral of Mrs. Frank Cheyefton,
who was a .member of the Rich
Hill Union. It' is pleasing to note
that nearly all the ministers of
Rich Hill are honorary members
and are aiding much in the work.
MINNEHAHA.
Green feed daily, in some form,
is of great importance. Usually it
';an be supplied at little or no ex
pense. It saves on the grain bill.
Some town poultry raisers can cut
a little of their lawn daily and
throw to the chicks. Other .forms
of green stuff are excellent.
The federal rural credits bill
has been signed by President Wil
son; another great achievement
for Democracy, in which Missouri
Democrats took a lead.

Notes-Front Laredo.
Laredo, Texas, July 28.
F.ditor Times: AVcll, we are
still located at Laredo, but there
has been some talk of moving the
Missouri troops to Corpus Christi,
but guess there will be nothing
eome of it. The sanitary condi
tions are as good here as any
where n the border and with the
exception of the terrific heat and
the sand storms which visit us fre
ouentjy, we are getting along
nicely. Company B spent one day
on the target range last wees
learning how to shoot. We have
had our turn at outpost duty and
have been guarding the different
fonts across the Rio Grande where
the bandits might be expected to
cross in search of loot. We have
electric lights in our tents and
pood shower baths to wash the
sand out of our skin when we
come in from a "hike."
The conditions in Laredo are
pitiful, refugees from Mexico are
fleeing to the United States in
droves and the poor, half starved
peons are over running the towns
along the border living in little
huts built of dry goods boxes or
anything else that they can get
to shelter them from the sun.
Children are seen every day fol
lowing -the soldiers around pick
ing up bread crumbs, watermelon
rinds or anything else eatable.
Most of them look half starved.
Fruit conditions look pretty
good here. Figs are now ripe and
oranges and lemons are getting to
be good sized. There are some
banana trees here,, but I have not
seen any big enough to bear.
Yours, The Clerk.
