LONIif)N, August 2.?The German
government has given a pledge to Hol
] land not to distrov or molest Hutch
ships carrying foodstuffs to Kngland.
according to a Copenhagen dispatch to
tho l'xpress. This ileclsion is the r<
i suit of a visit to Berlin of Cornelius
.1. K. van Aalst. president of tho
.Overseas Trust, and another Hutch
commissioner. The Kxpross says Van
Aalst presented an ultimatum to tho
authorities In Uerlln to the following
effect:
"t'nless Germany agrees pot to Inter
fere with Hutch etliips bound for Eng
! land with food cargoes. Holland will
close her eastern frontier. Otherwise,
the entente may stop Dutch Imports
l'rom America and the Dutch colonies."
The trip of the Dutch commissioner
was tho result of representations by
the entente that Holland was selling
large quantities of foodstuffs in Ger
many, while her food trade with Knr
land was made dangerous by German
; submarines. Van Aalst. fearing re
prisals by tho entente, then undertook
! the trip to Berlin, and after a scries of
j conferences obtained Germany's ac
ceptance of his demands.

I posed of. Senators llaidwiek. Georgia,
and Overnva:i. North Carolina, are ex

the measure. The former expects to
make a long speech as to the'bill's
j constitutionality.
j Senator Borah still proposes to sub
j mit the immigration bill as an amend

| spite the action of the Democratic
J caucus in voting to oppose such a move,
and this effort probably will prevent a
; vote being reached on the original bill
until next week.
The child-labor bill was recently in

Watch on Developments.
WASHINGTON. A u trust 2.?Officials
of tho Federal government, including ;
President Wilson, arc closely watching]
developments in the controversy he- '
tween 225 railway systems anil their
400.000 employees, and are preparing to
offer every possible aid in effecting an
agreement nnd avoiding a strike.
To-day the President forwarded to1
the T.abnr r>epartnient an appeal re- |
reived from the Chamber of Commerce I
of the United States through llarry A.
Wheeler, chairman of the chamber's
committee on resolutions, declaring a
strike Inevitable "unless some strong
measures of intervention are speedily
introduced." and urging an inquiry.
Acting Secretary of Labor Post to
night had not decided whether action
by the department would be necessary.
The Federal board of mediation and !
conciliation, authorized by law to at- i
tempt to avert strikes on railroads, j
also is keeping watch on developments, |
and its officials expect to bo called on (
as soon as the strike vote, now being j
counted, has been completely canvassed.
Copies of the chamber's appeal to (
President Wilson were forwarded chair- j
men of the congressional committees
and to representatives of the railroads j
and employees. The chamber is con
sidering calling a conference here to1
impress Congress with the advisability!
of immediate action.
VIOlTIIKIt SIDE KXI'KCTKD
TO IlECBDE FHOM STANIJ .
"I am assured," said Mr. Wheeler.!
"there will be no modification of the I
attitude of the roails. Neither is It
expected that the representatives of the
men. with the new power of the strlk*
vote In their hands, will recede from
the position which they have taken)
heretofore.
"The. United States board of media
tion and conciliation may come into
the matter at this point, but without
effect, in my Judgment, in bringing !
these contending factions together.
Finally, arbitration may be discussed,
and tiie break will come when the
roads absolutely refuse to arbitrate the
demands of the men and the men re- j
fuse with equal force to admit Into the
arbitrations the contingent proposals of |
the roads.
"I must confess in this situation,
after talking most earnestly with both
parties to the controversy, that 1 see
no ray of light nor any possibility of
averting a serious catastrophe."
Mr. Wheeler, in a message, said he
hoped he was wrong in his view of the
gravity of the situation, but that "the
public Interest in the controversy is a
definite and tangible third interest, and
the public has a right to know whether
any increase in cost of operation aris
ing from an adjustment of the differ
ences between the brotherhoods and the
railroads Is to be passed on for final
payment by an increase in rates for
transportat ion."
In anticipation of a general confer
ence here on the question, the chamber
has sent to all commercial bodies In the
country copies of tiie letter to the
President with a request that each send
a representative to such a meeting.

Not to Grant Reprieve.
EXECUTION HOUR 9 O'CLOCK'
Decision of Cabinet to Let Law
Take Its Course Will
Cause Surprise.
I/?XDO\, August 2.?Sir Roger Case- !
ment will ho executed at 9 o'clock to-|
morrow morning for high treason, i
l?ord Robert Cecil, Minister of War
Trade, to-day made known to the Asso- j
elated Press that it was tho British |
government's determination not to re- j
prieve Sir Roger.
Beyond the statement of Lord Rob
ert. which was in defense of the gov
ernment's determination, no formal
announcement to the effect tliat the
execution will he carried out to-mor
row has been made public. Officials
intimated to the Associated Press, how
ever, that this Is quite the usual pro
cedure, as a sentence on a convict car
ries with it the natural supposition of
execution, the only occasion for an
official announcement being: the grant
ing of a reprieve or a commutation of
sentence.
While the government maintains
silence as to the final efforts made on
behalf of Sir Roper, It lw known that
petitions were received as late as to
day. The Foreign Office says no com
munication has been received from tho
State Department at Washington re
questing- a reprlve.
WIIOI.K St lUKCT SKIITOUSIjV
COX SI I) KURD nv CAI1IXKT
The whole subject hns been seriously
considered by tho Cabinet, which de
termined to let the law take its course.
The decision of the government will
cause some surprise, as tho opinion had
become widespread that tho sentence of
Sir Roger would be commuted at the
last moment to life Imprisonment.
In explanation of the government's
refusal to reprieve Sir Roger Casement,
L.ord Robert Cecil gave to tho Asso
ciated Press the following statement:
"No doubt of Casement's guilt exists.
No one doubts that tho court and Jury
arrived at tho right verdict. The only
ground for a reprieve would be politi
cal expedience, a difficult ground to
put forward in this country.
"This country never could strain the
law to punish a man, for the same rea
son that It could not strain the law
to let one off.
"The Irish rebellion began with tho
murder of unarmed people, both sol
diers and police. No grievance Justi
fied it. and it was purely a political
movement organized by a small section
of Irish people who still hate England,
and was assisted by Germany.
"There was, and is, in this coun
try the greatest possible indignation
against these people. There Is no doubt
that Casement did everything possible to
to assist this rebellion in co-operation
with the Germans. There can be no
doubt that ho was moved by enmity for
this country.
"Tho contention that ho landed In
Ireland for the purpose of preventing^
the rebellion is demonstrably false.
No such assertion was made by counsel
at tho trial.
MUCH MORR MAI.IGXA XT
TIIAX I.KADKItS OP UISIXG
"Casement was much mora malignant
and hostile to this country than were'
the leaders of the rising who were \
caught with arms in their hands. He \
visited military prisons in Germany
with the intention of persuading Irish
soldiers to throw off their allegiance.
All sorts of promises were made for
tho Improvement of the condition of!
theso men to Induce them to Join the j
Irish legion. An enormous majority j
thus approached refused, and thereafter'
were subjected to Increased hardships I
by the Germans.
"From among those Irish soldiers a
number has since been repatriated as
hopeless Invalids, and they subse
quently died. They looked upon Case
ment as their murderer.
"Nor is there any ground, public or
private, so far as we know, which can
be quoted in mitigation of Casement's
crime, and I do not think any govern
ment doing its duty could interfere
with the sentence which has been
passed on him."

Eastern' States will, it is expected,
oppose the naming of a third ticket and
urge the Indorsement of President
Woodrow Wilson or fight to have the
conference adjourn without taking
action.
While the leaders who will attend
the conference are divided as to the j
wisdom of naming a national ticket j
at this time, they are a unit In pro- j
tectlng against the action of the tin- !
tional committee in Indorsing Hughes ,
and favor some action which will tend
to perpetuate the Progressive party as
a national organization.
Judgo Albert D. Nortoni, of.St. Louis. |
apparently reflected the sentiment of a!
majority of the early arrivals when he
said:
"I want somebody to vote for In
November. I will not vole for Wilson
or Hughes."

NORFOLK. August 2.?The Drutsch
land, tho giant German submarine,
cleared the United States shores at S:I10
to-night apparently unobserved by
hostile craft, and now, so far as in
known here, is safely homeward bound.
No untoward incident marred the de
parture of the Detitsehland shortly be
fore nightfall. She was accompanied
only by h^r tup and a newspaper dis
patch boat on her eighteen-mile dash
from lower Chesapeake Hay to the Vir
ginia capes, which ended about two
hours later, when her last light blinked
out in the doom.
None of tho allied cruisers which had
been waiting to intercept the subma
rine liner nor the lTnited States neu
trality ships which have been patrol
ling the neutral lino so closely recently
was in sight at the time of tho sub
marine's departure from the capes.
Whether she submerged before reach
ing the three-mil.- limit is unknown.
The night was dark and a heavy sea
was running. Hem e it was impossible
to detect her movements at the dis
tance she was from the two accom
panying boats. They only know that
she disappeared unharmed, and that
to all appearances she had a clear tlold
ahead to a point where she could com
pletely submerge In safety.
TilK TIM31 INS SKKMIXGI.Y
SATISKIKII WITH WORK
Within half an hour after the last
light of the Deutschland had disap
peared, her tug, the Thomas F. Tim
mins, hove into sight, seemingly sat
isfied with her work, and headed up
Chesapeake Bay in the direction of F.al
tlniore. It was from that city yester
day that tho Deutschland cleared with
a cargo of rubber, nickel and possibly
gold, twenty-three days after her sen
sational arrival in American waters
from Bremen.
The Bremen, sister ship of tho
Deutschland, as rumor had it, would
arrive hero with the Deutschland's de
parture, thus far has not appeared.
The Deutschland started for the capes
aft. ; arriving early to-day at a cove
up Chesapeake Bay where she remained
hidden.
For several hours prior to the be
ginning of the Deutschland's final dash
for the capes she was hidden near
Tangier Island, about fifty miles above
Cape Henry. The steamer Somerset,
and the government ..uoy tender Ivy
reported during the early afternoon
that they hail passed her at that point.
The press boat then took a position
near the dividing point of tho Old
Point and Capo Henry channels, and
awaited the coming of the undersea
vessel.
SI !\N I.ow OV WATKIt WITH
ONl,\ CONNING TOWICH MtOWI.M}
It was shortly before ii o'clock that
the first sight of her wjjs obtained.
Apparently she was about five milc3
away, and was low in the water, only
her conning tower showing. The Tim
mins was a short distance behind her.
and they were running about seven
miles an hour.
When near the entrance to Mobjack
Bay the Deutschland sighted the press
boat and Immediately reversed herself
and appeared to be making for the bay.
After running for about two miles, she
again headed south until she was
abreast of the Tlmmlns. and then hoth
vessels put on full speed ahead toward
the press boat. Suddenly they turned
oft as if to go down the Old Point
channel, but upon the dispatch boat
making- for the same channel thev
changed their course and headed di
rectly for Cape Henry.
As tho Deutsrhland came on it was
apparent that, she was carrying false
sunperst met ure, slightly lower than
her conning tower. It was straw
colored and blended with the oil-skin
coats worn by tho crew who crowded
tho deck. When about a mile from tho
press boat the submersible began to
clear away the false, superstructure
and take soundings, as if preparing to
dive, .lust as the false superstructure
was entirely cleared away, the Tim ruins
moved ahead of the undersea liner and
signaled that they intended to pass
on the starboard side. Immediately
both vessels increased their speed and
put over to the starboard.
As tho Tlmminu camo alongside the
press boat at a distance of perhaps
100 feet, and with the Deutschland
moving slowly close to her starboard
side. Captain llinsh, of the German
war-bound steamer Necker, who had
charge of the clearing of the Deutsch
land, shouted through a megaphone,
"Who's that'.'"
