That green forage crop3 lower the
cost of pork production materially is
demonstrated by experiments at
the Ohio Experiment Station. Al
falfa, clover, rape, soybeans, and
bluegrass are adapted to hog pas
ture. In one experiment lasting 11
weeks in midsummer, clover replac
ed 71 pounds of corn in every 100
pound gain made bjf the hogs
Rape replaced 04 pounds and soy
beans 54 pounds. All these hogs
received corn in addition to pasture.
They made cheaper gain than
those fed only grain in dry lot.
Rape makes an abundant, palat
able growth and has a long grazing
season. An acre will usually supply
green feed for three months for 30
hogs weighing about 100 pounds.
Soybeans may bo grazed from
July 1 for a period of about 10
week3. Since bluegrass is suscept
ible to drouth, it has its gratest
value for early spring use.
CHANGE OF WEATHER.
After cooking everybody and every
thing, the weather man changed the
temperature anil saved the lives and
dispositions of many. Wind, rain and
hail passed around Perrysburg on
Monday and cooled the temperature,
but left us all singing that familiar
ballad "How Dry I Am."
As a candidate for tho offce of
county conunissioner, I desire to
assure all the voters that their as
sistance and votes will certainly
be appreciated.
It will bo impossible for me to
call on every voter, but I wish all
to understand that I greatly, desire
their .support.
Especially am I anxious to re
ceive as many votes as possible in
my home township Perrysburg
where I have spent my entire days
and have always endeavored to
prove" myself worthy the confi
dence and support of tho people.
L will be truly thankful for
every vote and kindness. Don't
fail to vote August 8.

The Chautauqua at Perrysburg
closed a fivo days session of high
class entertainment on Wednesday
night.
From a standpoint o f good,
clean, educational entertainment,
tlie program as rendered gave big
value for the money expended, and
as compared with the street carni
va carousal it was as a rose-scented
breath from sweet Elysium to
that of a foul smell from a ferti
lizer factory.
People of Perrysburg and vicin
ity should give much credit to the
men who furnished the financial
backing making it possible to
bring this series of high class at
tractions to Perrysburg.
Every session was well worthy
of special consideration.
It was all high class from the
humblest employee to the Superin
tendent. Mr. Purdy, who certainly
is a most eapablo gentleman. He
leaves many warm friends in Per
rysburg who will be well pleased
to know of his return next season.
The excellent violin playing of
Mr. E. C. Adams on Monday was
worth more than the cost of the
whole season ticket. His audience
seemed to he unwilling to allow
him to leave the stage. His music
went straight to the heart and cap
tured every hearer. Oh, that he
might come again.
INTERNATIONAL
LIVE STOCK SHOW.
Columbus, Ohio, July 31. Win
Kinnan, manager of the Ohio State
fair, has received word from II. B.
Heide, genenft manager of the In
ternational Live Stock Show, Chi
cago, that he will have a big tent
erected at the State fair this year
in which exhibitors will be enter
tained. Mr. Ileide plans to ar
range many novel methods crten
tertaining exhibitors during the
fair.
This is the first time the Inter
national has ever taken part in the
Ohio State fair, and it was only
through the efforts of Mr. Kinnan
that tho association agreed to do
so. The original intention was to
take part in the Iowa State fair,
which is held at the same time as
the Ohio State fair, but Mr. Heide
stated that because of the pros
pects in Columbus for one of the
largest state fairs iu the history
of tho country, the International
could not afford to miss the oppor
tunity of being present.

Now that the Chautauqua is
over, and as all citizens need some-
thing to keep their minds busy and minded the spectators of an old
off. the subject of tho hot weather, fashioned Quaker meeting he-
attention should he directed to the
approaching Centennial in order
that every possible feature inci
dental to such a celebration should

The committee hoped to have
Governor Willis come to Pcrrys
burg for A brief visit on the Cen
tennial day, but he has informed
us that other engagements make
it impossible.
The committee has arranged for
a splendid program of music by
one of the best hands of the state.

CIVIC MEETING.
All members are requested to
meet at the assembly room, Friday
night of this week to arrange for
the Perrysburg Centennial to be
held the last of August. Come!
Your presence is vitally necessary.
REPUBLICAN TOUR.
With a small band and loud noise
at the head, a procession of the Re
publican candidates made a tour of
the county, calling at Perrysburg on
Tuesday morning, where they dis
tributed circulars, handshakes and
broad smiles.
Hon. Franklin P. Riegle, Wood
county's candidate for Congress, head
ed the list and was called upon for a
speech. He responded and was ac
corded a fine reception.
THE APPELLATE JUDGESHIP.
The Court of Appeals of the
District is composed of Judge Si
las S. Richards of Sandusky coun
ty, Presiding Judge of the Court,
whose first term expires next Feb
ruary; Judge Charles E. Critten
den of Toledo, whose term expires
in February, 1919 ; and Judge Rey
nolds R. Kinkade, also of Toledo,
whoso term expires in February,
1921. There are eight counties in
tho District, namely, Lucas, Wood,
Ottawa, Sandusky, Erie, Huron,
Fulton and Williams. It will be
noticed that Judge Richards is the
only representative on the appel
late court of the counties outside
of Toledo. He is a candidate for
re-election next November.
Judge Chittenden was elected as
a Democrat, Judge Kinkade as a
Republican. Judge Richards is
also a Republican, but as the
judges -are elected on a non-partisan
ticket, and as the proper per
formance of their duties makes it
necessary to avoid all appearances
of partisanship, Judge Richards
lias not entered tho partisan con
test to be held in August, but his
name will appear on the November
ballot.
Voters are urged to familiarize
themselves with Judge Richards'
record on the Common Pleas and
Appellato Courts, so as to bo pre
pared to vote intelligently on the
appellate judgship in November.

The meeting of the Village Fath
ers on last Wednesday evening re-
cause it wa s-0-0-0 different.
When the Mayor called the
meeting to order he had the pleas
ure of noting the preence of all
councilmen. He also beheld his
faithful clerk and djd not need, to
pinch himself to know that he (the
Mayor ( was there, also.
The session opened mildly with
granting permission to the Luth
eran church to remain in its pres
ent temporary location until such
time as the new building might be
completed. Following this, side
walk intersections were ordered on
5th street.
Then it began to happen.
A resolution from the Civic As
sociation protesting against the
recent order of council granting
Dr. Bowers permission to locate
sidewalk on a line further from
the lot line than is the rule in all
other parts of town was read.
Either the council is not on speak
ing terms with the Civic Associa
tion or they had not been pproper-
ly introduced, or something like
that, for the only sign that the
resolution had been read was the
echo of the Clerk's voice as he
gently laid the resolution to rest
in the village mausoleum.
Councilman Neiderhouse intro
duced a resolution establishing a
permanent sidewalk line four feet
from the property line, and moved
the suspension of the rules for the
adoption of the resolution. His
motion was seconded by Council
man Dibling. The vote stood
yea, Dibling and Neiderhouse.
Nay Dowling, Leydorf, Thornton
and Witzler.
An initiative petition signed by
77 citizens asking for a referen
dum vote upon the matter of es
tablishing a sidewalk line four
feet from the property line, was
filed with tho council. The peti
tion will be open for inspection for
10 days and will then be filed wi'th
the County Board of Elections to
bo voted upon by the citizens of
the village at the next regular
election.
Councilman Witzler introduced
a resolution which was for the pur
pose of granting Dr. Bowers the
right to construct his sidewalk 14
feet from the property line, nis
motion for adoption was seconded
by Councilman Leydorf.
Mayor Roether declared the mo
tion illegal and refused to enter
tain. Mr. Witzler moved an ap
peal from the Mayor's decision,
and the Mayor ruled him out of
order.
Just about this time things were
happening. It was a 'regular
Chautauqua by home talent with a
B. G. lawyer as a "steering com
mittee," but Mayor Roether
seemed to think he. had arrived
first and didn't need much assist
ance from imported talent and
continued to keep his grip on the
steering wheel. However, tho
Mayor concluded to allow the mo
tion to reach a vote which was re
corded as follows Aye, Dowling,
LeydorfJ Witzler and Thornton.
Nay Dibling and Neiderhouse.
The Mayor declared the motion
lost 5 votes being necessary.
Then there was more noise from
B. G. mut His Honor was still on
the throno when the battle closed

Perrysburg easily defeated Met
amora Sunday afternoon by the
score of 8 to 5. The visitors claim
they were out of form as they did
not play their usual game. Errors
were, their main features. After
Perrysburg had gathered six runs
they eased after seeing they had
an easy victory. Engle toyed with
the hatters and let them hit to
make the game a little exciting,
and they gathered five runs in the
last four innings. Berry pitched a
good game for Metamora but his
support was poor.

Next Sunday Martin, Ohio base
ball club will be here to vbattle
with the locals. Martin boasts a
good team and did not want to
come to Perrysburg unless there
was a good team here. If Martin
plays up to their claim there will
be a real ball game on the local's
lot. Don't fail to see this game.
Come one, come all, and root for
your favorite team.
On Sunday, August 13th, the
Mulberry ball team will be here.
This team is made up mostly of
Raillight players, and a good game
is assured.

FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER.
Chas. T. Eggleston.
The subject of this sketch was born
in Ross township, Wood county, 47
yeaTS ago, where he has since resided,
He is a farmer and business man and
is a supporter of things progressive
along practical lines. He is, and al
ways has been, a Republican, having
served on the Central Committee for a
period of 14 years. While acting on
his own convictions, he is willing to
give due respect to the opinion of those
who differ. Owing to the lateness of
his announced candidacy, he may be
unable to visit as many voters as a
thorough canvass would require, but
hopes for the consideration and sup
port of the Republicans of Wood
county for the nomination of County
Commissioner. Adv.
