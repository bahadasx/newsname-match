Washington, Aug. 3. Readjustment
of passenger fares between St. Louis
and Keokuk, Iowa, and points in Illi
nois, was ordered today by the inter
state commerce commission, in up
holding complaint of the St. Eouis
Business Men's league that the pres
ent fares are unreasonable and dis
criminatory against those cities and
in favor of East St Louis, Chicago
and other Illinois points. The existing
rate of toll for crossing the Mississippi
river at St. Louis and Keokuk was

directed the interested carriers to
construct their rates on a basis of 2.4
per mile plus a reasonable toll for
crossing the Mississippi and ordered
that the fares between these cities
and Illinois points should not exceed
the fare from Chicago where the des
tinations are In a same.
In an opinion the commission says
that prior to its decision in the five
per cent freight rate case and its
grainting of an increase of one-half
cent a mile in interstate passenger
fares, charges between St. Louis and
Illinois points were substantially the
same but failure to increase the intra
state fare in Illinois resulted in a dis
parity. The Chicago association of com
merce and the Illinois state public
utilities commission intervened to
fight any changes in rates in Illinois.
POLICE UNCOVER
JEW FRAUD GAME
Mrs. Lilly Lewis Placed in Jail at
Creston, Iowa, as Result of Horse
Insurance Cases.
Creston. Iowa, Aug. 3. Mrs. Lilly
Lewis, Sewall, Iowa, charged with
using the mails to defraud, was put in

monev, killing inferior animals, sub
stituting their bodies and collecting
tho insurance.
The similarity in so many cases
where horses were found under trees
from which the bark had been peeled
to indicate a stroke of lightning led
to an investigation and the alleged
expose. It is said the conspiracy ex
ists over the central west and that
other arrests will follow.

BIG PROTEST

Progressives Gather at In

mal Objection.
ARE AGAINST HUGHES
Will Not Permit Justice to
Head Ticket Going to
Select Leader.
Indianapolis, Ind., Aug. 3. Repre
sentatives of the progressive party
from a score of states met here today
to formally protest against the action
of the bull moose national committee
in endorsing Charles E. Hughes for
president in Chicago, June 2f, and con
sider the advisability of calling anoth
er convention to fill the vacancy in its
national ticket caused by the declina
tion of Theodore Roosevelt to accept
the nomination for president. The con
ference was called by John M. Parker
of Louisiana, nominee of the progres
sive party for vice president. Repre
sentatives of one element of the party
led by Judge Albert D. Xortoni, of
St Louis, favored reassembling the
progressive national convention at an
early date to nominate a candidate for
president to run with John M. Parker,
the vice presidential nominee. Anoth
er faction was prepared to urge is
suance of a call lor a new convention
to complete the national ticket. In
fluential bull moose leaders from sev
eral states are opposed to both plans
on the ground that they had no avail
able candidate for president and that
there was insufficient time in which
to organize for a national campagin.
Committee Violates Principles.
" All present, however, were
imous that the national committee
its meeting in Chicago, had violated
the party's principles in endorsing the
candidate of another political organi
zation for president.
It is expected that resolutions will
be adopted criticizing the national
committee for endorsing Hughes for
president. If an attempt should be
made to have the conference endorse
the candidacy of President Wilson for
reelection, there is every indication
that it would be voted down. The only
names mentioned early in the day for
the head of the bull moose ticket were
Victor Murdock of Kansas, who al
ready has declined the honor and i3
said to be now on his way to China,
and Bainbridge Colby of New York.
Will ot Support Hughes.
Judge Albert D. Nortoni of St.
L6uis said: "We want a national tick
et. We don't care who is nominated
for president just so we have some
body to vote for in November."
John M. Parker cf Louisiana said
his only desire is to see the progres
sive party left alive as a national po
litical organization.
Among those present was Henry H.
Griffiths of Iowa.
Secretary Hopkins called the roll of
the states and reports were made of
the situation in the progressive ranks.
The reports indicated that in every
state represented a majority of the
progressives disapproved of the action
of the national committee in endors
ing Hughes and favored putting a na
tional ticket in the field if practicable.
A recess was taken until late in the
afternoon.

Former British Knight and

CALMLY AWAITS DEATH j
Chief of Sinn Feiners Shows
No Emotions Before the
Trap Is Sprung.
London, Aug. 3 (3:07 a. m.) Roger
Casement, former British knight and
consul, was hanged at 9 o'clock this
morning in Pentonville jail for. high
treason. He was convicted of con
spiring to cause an armed revolt In
Ireland and with having sought Ger
man aid to that end.
Two hours before the execution a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates.
Twenty minutes before Casement
mounted the scaffold the great prison
bell commenced to toll. The sound
was greeted with cheers from the
crowd, mingled with some groans. At'
9 o'clock the crowd extended for two
blocks from the prison front. At one i
minute after 9 a single stroke of the
big bell announced that the trap had
been sprung. It was the signal for a'
mocking, jeering yell from the crowd,,
which suddenly died away Into dead
silence.
Moets Death Calmly.
Casement met his death with calm
courage, according to eye-witnesses.
Earlier in the morning two priests of
the Roman Catholic church adminis-1
tered the last rites in his cell, and!
shortly afterward a little procession, i
headed by the clergymen, with Case
ment following, a warden on either'
side, proceeded toward the execution :
shed, only five yards away. The priests
recited the litany of the dying, Case
ment responding In low toned! "T.orri .
have mercy on my soul."
As the party reached the shed where
the gallows Was erected h ar.ru
executioner, a hair-dresser named El
lis, approached Casement and quick
ly pinionea mm. The two chaplains,
the under-sheriff of liminn rwi f,
under-sheriff of Middlesex, then took
up tneir positions in Tront of the scaf
fold. Casement mounted the gallows
steps firmly and commended his spirit
to God as he stepped on the trap. A
moment later the lever was pulled.
immediately the trap was sprung.
The prison engineer and physician de
scended into the pit, where, after the
application of the usual tests, Case
ment was nrononnrmt rlonri at nlna
minutes after 9. His body will be bur
ied in quicklime in the prison yard.
Irish Pray for Casement.
An affecting incident took place
outside the prison wall as the execu
tion was in progress. At the back of
the Drison a little distanre from thn
Jeering crowd about the gates, was a
group oi anout tnirty irisii men and
women. When the dull clang of the
prison bell announced that the doomed
man had paid tho last penalty this
little group fell on their knees and
with bowed heads remained for noma
moments silently praying for the re
pose or tno soul or their dead fellow
countryman. Immediately after th KTiwitlnn
three notices were posted fin tho
prison door. The first, signed by the
under-sheriff of London. th iovrnnr
of the prison and Father James Mc-
v arreii, casement s eonressor, read:
"Judgment of death was this day
executed on Roger David Casement in
his majesty's prison of Pentonville la

A similar notice was Kiirnr! hv th
under-sheriff of Middlesex county.
The third bore the name of P. R. Man

that he had examined the body and
found Casement dead.
