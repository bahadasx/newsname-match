Clark's Hill, S. C.
A prominent lawyer tells this
story:
"I remember 30 years ago there
were about 15 or 18 of us-all law
yers-seated about a fire place, at a
hotel. A bedraggled stranger, wet
to the hide, came in, tried to get ac
commodations, and was told there
was not a room left. The nearest
other place quite a distance away.
Shivering, the stranger looked at the
fire, but we formed such a solid
line about it that he turned regret
fully aside. Then one of the lawyers
in a spirit of frivolity turned to him
and said:
"My friend, are you a traveler?"
"I am sir. I ?nave been all over
the world."
"You don't say! Been in Germa
ny, Egypt, Japan, Africa and
Asia?"
"All of them, been everywhere."
"Ever been in hell?"
"Oh, yes, been there twice in my
life."
"How did you find things there?"
"Oh, much the same a s here
lawyers all next to the fire."

get it in time for last week's issue
of your paper. I will write "Uncle

Mr. H. H. Scott:
Dear Old Comrade:-Yours of
8th instant came to hand yesterday,
and.? was certainly glad to get it.
As I have just finished hoeing a
small-potato patch, ate my fill of
watermelon, picked up the peaches
from under the trees and fed them
to my shoats, and am a little tired
(that is my legs, arms and back), I
will, chat you just a little. Yes, I
am sorry to say it, but it is true,
when boots and saddle call was
sounded by our bugler it had a
strange effect on just a few of Com
pany I. They were either sick, as
yon said, or their horses backs were
Bore. ' Well, Hugh, I guess they
just couldn't help it.
But let me tell you how one of [
them was cured from saying his
horsens back was sore. (I shall call
no name, for I guess you know.)
While we were camped at Sandy
Spring, not far from Stevenburg,
the! Yankees crossed the Rappahan
nook'-river, somewhere above where
the railroad that runs through the
toyga-of, Culpepper, and was about
?OM^.'Lhc Fir?t Iv. C.-tfath?ry and:
the old Second S. C. cavalry off,
and came very near hemming the
two regiments'up in the forks of
the Rappahannock and Rapidan,
but they were not successful, but we
sure had to get about in a hurry.
Capt. Clark missed a few men from
Company I, and he went to see
about them, and found the one I
spoke of riding a horse that belonged
to one of the men of Company I,
who had gone home on a furlough,
and the captain told him to come
with him to the front, and his reply
was, that the horse did not belong
to him, and if it got killed he would
have to pay for it, but it didn't
work. The captain brought him,
and put him in between Aus. Boyle
and myself and told us if he
wouldn't tight just to kill him and
to leave him there, as the Confeder
ate government was not able nor
wouldn't feed men to follow the
wagons. And Boyle looked at the
fellow and called him by name, and
said: "You had as well be killed by
the Yankees as for myself, Morgan
or 'Bear' (Sam Adams) to kill you,
and one of us surely will if you
don't go to shooting at the Yankees
just across an open held." Just
then a Yankee officer came out from
?a thicket and ran behind a big
dwelling house, and Boyle said to
(the fellow: "Now, yon are a good
shot, and when that man's horse's
neck shows from behind the house
yon, get either the Yankee or his
horse," and just as the horse's shoul
ders came in view, crack went that
fellow's rifle and down went the
horse, but the rider jumped off and
ran behind the house, and at the
same time the fellow's horse jerked
loose from his arm and ran off, leav
ing him afoot, but all fear seemed
leave the man, and he fought on
foot, keening along with us till we
crossed the Rappadan two miles
away; and after that if his horse's
back was sore no one knew it, and
he told Boyle and I that he had just
got it into his head that he would
be killed the first fight he went in.
He was wrong, and after that he
made a good soldier, and was one
of the best rifle shots in the old
second. 1 could tell of other inci
dents that took place that same day.
Lumus, from Company D, was
shot through and through, and be
was riding just in front of me, and

In this spason of good times there

There are morning, afternoon, and

On Tuesday morning a delightful
rook party was enjoyed by a crowd

Dinner at Ropers.
On the day of the county cam
paign meetiug at Ropers, Saturday,
August 12, dinner will be served
for the benefit of the school. The
people of the community have un
der contemplation the erection of a
new building. Adults will be charg
ed 35 cents for dinner and children
20 cents. Ladies will carry well
filled baskets and a picnic dinner
will be served, the menu being all
that the most exacting Epicure
could desire. The Advertiser, be
ing always in active sympathy with
every effort to improve the schools
of the county, and particularly the
erection of adequate buildings, hopes
that the people of the Ropers sec

August 12.
saddle, and would have fallen off
his horse, but Lieut. Martert caught
him and held him till he got his
breath, the ball having struck him
in the back, but too far spent to
penetrate the flesh, and Lieut. Tal
bert was cut under the arm, but
only a slight flesh wound, and I be
lieved then and still believe that the
bullet that went through Lu mus was
the same that. ?tm ck Capt. Clark,
and Lieut. Tarbert." "
Speaking of Lieut Markert, I
must say he was one of the coolest
fighters I ever knew. It seems like
I can hear him now (when I fell in
the gully at Jack's shops and sprain
ed my ankle and N. L. Griffis lifted
me up). "Lippe Griffin, come avay
from Morgan; no use for two to be
killed, veu maybe not vun." And
Lippe went on, and I came out by
using my rifle as a kind of crutch.
And can see old Mark (that you
know is what the boys all called
him) standing up at that rock fence,
and hear him say: "Comes on Mor
gan; py gats I holds te fence till
you gits hear;" and call to the
men not to "shoots Morgan, but to
giff tem Yankees-. I came out
and Mark caught me by the hand
and helped me over the rock fence,
and says, ''Veil, Morgan, tem yan
kees thought they had you when
you fell, but they didn't."
Hugh, I could tell more about
the Jack's shop tight, but will say
only this: Capt. Clark thought I
was killed when that bullet struck
me; so did Larena Parkman and Dr.
LaGrone, but thc bullet went
through a limb that I was just in
the act of resting my rifle on to
shoot at a Yankee across the field
under a bush. I was knocked out
of breath, but Dr. LaGrone worked
with me till he got me to breathing
free, and tben Sam Adams needed
nis attention, being shot through
the thigh; but Robbie Cannon of
Company D never knew what hit
him, the bullet entering the fore
head and going through his head.
Capt. Clark told me after the tight
that one Yankee shot Cannon, Sam
Adams and myself, aud that was
the Yankee that I intended shooting
at but he got in the first lick, and I
knew nothing for several minutes.
Hugh, I am going to look for
you to come to Harlem. Let me
know the day and I will D. V. be
sure to meet you there, and bring
you home with me, too, and we will
talk over old times.
God bless you, my old comrade
and brother.
