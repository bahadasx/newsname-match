Bleedii g Candidates
Oui a tie i ion has been called
to h custom dial has arisen in
this county Jong with the presi
ent method) of conducting the
K policial can paian, the oircnlation
of peti ions as various as
are^thilneec i of mankind.
lr The f ben ificiaries of these
petitions, it is said, tango all j
the way from the owners of sick
moles and cr wb to churches with 1
worn carpets and broken win- <
dows. They are said to be so (
numerous during the period of <
th local campaign that for one !
to subscribe to their, all ho would (
HI Ueed the resources of a John 1). <
Jtoekefeller and the political <
] disposition to buy votes through <
Tjf charity of a 4'Tim" Sullivan. !
Now if this ciijtom is as pre- <
i valeut as it i6 said to be it ought i
V*' to be frowned upon by every <
good citizen of the county, and <
thereby banished. It is unfair <
to the candidate to present him <
with a hundred requests for
money at a time when h? is particularly
anxious to please everybody
and yet engaged in a hazard
that ia necessarily expensive.
It is immoral in that it is a request
for him to violute his
pledge and make of his oath not
to use money or whiskey a lie.
Let every circulator of such a
petition bear this in mind when
he presents his petition to a
i candidate that the office-seeker
I ; has made oath that he will use
| neither "Whisky nor money" in
a his campaign and that he is also
K honor bound to report on all his
a his campaign expenditures.
This information was not given
The Advertiser by a candidate
y but by one v/ho ir interested in
vi fair play to til men. It is sinfcerely
hope*', that this practice
will bo held up until after elecj

Ladies' Rest Room
Miss Stella Mims, the Home
Demonstration Agent for Chesterfield
County, wishes very
much to establish a rest room
for the people of the country
when they come to town to do
their shopping.
There is no denying the fact
that the ladies from the country
should have a room where they
come to town, and it is the duty
of the merchants of Chesterfield
to see tha" Miss Mims receives
encouragement in a substantial
way towards the establishment
of the rest room.
Secretary C. L. Hunley, of the
County Pair, says that the Fair
Associatio i approves of Miss
Mims' idea and that they are
willing to contribute liberally
out of the Fair funds toward
Miss Mims' project.
Let others come forward with
lioeranty ana the rest room will
be established. Those interested
should spsak to Miss Minis at
once.
The enroll meat for Chesterlield
County w'll pass the 4,000
mark this yer This is the
largest enrollment the county
has ever show i, the enrollment
of two years ago numbering
about 3,700.
It may be of interest to the
voters to know that in point of
enrollment this county is second
in the district only to York. The
district is composed of seven
counties, OheroKee, York, Chester,
Fairtield, Lancaster, Kershaw
and Chester field.

it too with several jars of pickle,
jelly, peaches and preserves,
which 1 have made all . by myself.
Mamma said what I learned
about sewing on the cap and
apron before I went to Chesterfield
has already been lots of
help to her.
1 thought Mr. Long's talks were
of important interest to the
farmers. I tried to remember
it all to tell papa.
I am sure what Miss Moore
taught about keeping our record
books, grading and labeling our
tomatoes will be appreciated by
all the girls.

Rev. B. D. Thames Conducts

Rev. B. D. Thames, of Patrick,
has been conducting a series
of successful revival meetings
in the county (lining the
past few weeks. At Bay Spring
church he assisted the Rev. J.
D. Purvis for one week, beginning
July 10th. Here there were
ten additions to the church and
many professions of faith.
At Palmetto the series of
meetings began July 23d. This
is said to be the greatest meeting
this church has ever had.
Sixteen were baptized last Sun
day and the strength of the
church is sa d to have been

Baptist Sunday School Convention
The Chesterfield Baptist. Sunday
school convention convened
in annual session at Thompson
Creek church Friday morning
at 10:30. The meeting was called
to order by the president, Mr.
J. F. Crawley, and devotional
exercises were conducted by
tiev. J, K. Haire.
Messrs. J. F. Crawley and J.
H. White were re-elected president
and vice president respectively.
A. F. Funderburg was
elected secretary.
Delegates were then enrolled.
The attendance was not large,
due perhaps to the rains, bad
-1 ^ 11 a I
ruaiis, iuu streams anc DroKen
bridges. Rev- J. K- II aire
preached a very strong sermon,
and the meeting adjourned for
dinner, which proved a real
feast.
Report showing the progress
of the work in the schools of the
county were heard after the
noon hour. Mrs. A. F. Funderburk
then addressed the meeting
on the subject of misions and
mission study. Her talk was
high'y enjoyed and no doubt
much benefit was drived therefrom.
Bro, J. Arthur Knight
then made a very strong and impressive
address, his subject being,
"Sunday School and Service."
Rev. B. D. Thames
preached a very strong and highly
appreciated sermon to the
convention, his theme being
"Sunday School and Evangelical
work."
Saturday morning opened with
J a. * 1 a . i
uevniionai services conauctevi oy
J. R. Melton. This was a praise
service and many participated,
making it a very interesting service.
In the absence of R^v. R.
W. Catoe, the subject "Spiritual
Life of a Sunday School'' was
ably discussed by Rev. J. K.
rlaire. The convention owes
much to Mr. Ilaire, as he was
always ready to till the place of
the absent ones.
The committee on time and,
place of next meeting, consisting
jf I. R. Melton, II. Z Oaten, s
John G. Ilursey, reported Chesterfield
as the place, and Friday
before the fourth Sunday in July
1917 as the time.

secretary to have 1,000 blanks J
printed to he mailed out to all j
the superintendents of each Sunday

Congressional Day
Th^ speaking of the Congressional
candidates, D, E. Finley
and W. F. Stevonson, brought
quite a crowd to town on Saturday
and if one may judge
from general appearances, it was
a Stevenson crowd. At any
rate, Mr. Stevenson got a lion's
share of the applause. .
The speaking first began in
the courthouse auditorium, but
as the room would not accommodate
the crowd it was decided to
move down into the yard.
The presence of about sixteen
young ladies added life and color
to the scene that here presented
itBelf to the candidates. It
might be said in passing that
there was nothing to indicate
that these ladies were in any
sense of the word out of place in
listening to political speeches.
Both speakers refrained from
dealing in personalities and the
entire debate was conducted in
a very satisfactory manner, president
over by the Hon. M. J.
Hough, county chairman
Mr. Stevenson, in e' "ting
his platform, which i3 e or
less familiar to all the people of
the Fifth Congressional District
by this time, managed to keep
lus opponent on the defensive.
Not only did he keep to the front
his constructive ideas concerning
road improvement with Federal
aid and better farm loan system
but he managed to keep Mr.
feTnley explaining and apologizing
for his acts or his failure to
act, which left the Congressman
little time for other things.
The passage of or attempt at
passage of the immigration
measure containing a literacy
test for new immigrants came in
for a good deal of discussion.
While this measure is admittedly
important from a national
point of view, it can effect the
Fifth Congressional District only
indirectly.
The speaking was interesting
throughout and the many goodnatured
quips passed between
the candidates amu.;wl the hear
ers and seemed to cause no hard
feeling between the speakers.
Summer School For
Corn Club Boys
About 85 boys on the .'list of
.July, attended the Hoys' Corn

How Men Stick Together
A prominent San Francisco
'clubman has a country home
down at San M teo, where most
of the wealthy folks of the city
I live. Recently he had an autoI
mobile accident <\t a lonely soot
on the road, where he found it
! impossible to reach a telephone
! to notify his wife,
j Now, it happened that he was
i happily married, very domesti'
, rated, and not accustomed to
'j staying out at night. So at mid'
night his wife became very nerv'i
oils. She dispatched :ne foliow'
ing telegram to live of her husr,
band's best friends in tiiecity:
"i "Jack hasn't come home. Am
t worried. Is he spending the
* night with you?"
* Soon after this her husband
. arrived home and explained the
- cause of the delay. While he
.; was talking a boy brought in five
answers to her telegrams, all
' worded thus:
0 "Yes, Jack is spending the
