Public Not Admitted.
The hanging was witnessed only by
officials of the prison. A large crowd
waited outside the grim goal and
when the bell tolled announcing the
law's satisfaction there were a few
cheers intermixed with groans. Sev
eral Irish women standing at the rear
of the Pentonville Jail attempted a
demonstration, led by an Irish mem
ber of parliament, but were quickly
hustled off the scene by guards. It
was said Casement went calmly to his
death led by a Catholic priest who
ministered to him when he retired lasn
night for the last time at 10:30 and
when he arose early today. The Irish
leader has only recently been convert
ed to Catholicism.
Two Catholic priests Fathers Ring
and Carey heard Casement's last con
fession and administered holy com
munion to the condemned man. Both
accompanied him to the scaffold.
Leaving his cell on the summons to
deatlw the Irishman appeared slightly
nervous, but there were no Ttlcns of a
breakdown and he smiled gravely at
his guard, remarking:
"It is a beautiful morning."
Irishmen Fell on Knees.
Several of the Irishmen - in the
crowd outside the Jail fell on their
knees and prayed fervently during the
telling of the bell which announced
Casement's death. On the other hand
there were a few in the watchers, men
and women, who waved hats an-1
handkerchiefs.

last Act of Crew, "Three
Cheers for America."
BY CARL D. GROAT.
Norfolk. Va., Aug. 3. Somewhere
in the direction of Germany, safely
past the allied warship patrol, the sub
marine merchantman Deutschland Is
boring her way through the Atlantic
toward her home port of Bremen. Re
ports coming in to Hampton Roads in
dicate the pioneer submarine blockade
runner has not poked her periscope
pbove the water since she submerged
near the capes last night. At that
t'me the nearest British warship was
five miles distant, according to offi
cers of the tug Thomas F. Timmins,
which accompanied the Deutschland
as tar as the capes.
Expectation of a thrilling chasi and
perhaps some sort of a fight in con
nection with the Deutschland's de
parture was disappointed. Folks on
shore saw nothing and cightseers who
filled big and little harbor craft saw
little more. In the dark of the night
the Deutschland slipped out to the
boundary edge of the United States
territorial waters and ducked under
and disappeared. That was all.
Cheers for American People.
Somewhere out in the Atlantic the
German merchant submarine Deutsch
land and allied warships are playing
hide and seek as the undersea boat
speeds homeward.
The Deutschland submerged a mile
off the coast shortlv before 9 o'clock
and so far as known here was unob-
served by the allied warship patrol
guarding the capes against her es
cape. One oi the last acts of Captain
Koenig and his crew, according to
Captain Hinsch of the tug Timmins,
which acttd as her convoy from Balti
more to the capes, was to stand on
the deck of the submersible and give
three rousing cheers for America and
the American people.
The final dash was virtually with
out incident.

Urge Inquiry on Behalf of
Administration.
HE CALLS CONSULTATION
Confers on Situation With
Board of Mediation.
Towns as Well as Cities Would
Suffer Food Shortage.
BY ROBERT J. BENDER
Washington, Aug. 3. A problem,
"tremendously dangerous in both its
economic and political aspects' faces
President Wilson in the threatened
strike of 400,000 railroad trainmen,
according to administration officials
today.
strike vote Is counted-sxpected Au-
gust 7 the president probably will
decide no course of action.
Would Stop Grain Shipments.
From an economic standpoint, the
strike, if called, would assume cata
clysmic proportions in the belief of
officials here. It would completely tie
ud freight traffic throughout the
country, halting grain shipments, food
and supplies of all kinds to an extent
and with results impossible to fore
cast. The smaller towns would suffer
most. It is believed particularly those
which are not self-supporting or with
in a territory supplying food. Mining
towns where supplies for only two or
three days are kept, would be in im
mediate danger of starvation or com
plete business collapse as Its people
left for other points. . Losses, accord
ing to government officials would
mount into hundreds of millions of
dollars.-"
Situation Full of Dynamite.
From- a "political standpoint, the
president's position, in attempting to
bring about an adjustment of the dif
ficulty, is vfull of dynamite" according
to his advisers.
President Wilson- today requested a
conference with Commissioner Cham
bers of the TJnited States board of me
diation and conciliation, presumably
to discuss the threatened strike of the
bisr four brotherhoods of railway men,
which would cause a nationwide tle-
u n of transportation.
Unions Won't Arbitrate.
The trainmen say they , won't arbi
trate, and the railroads say they won't
yield. Should the president, by shirt
sleeve diplomacy demand arbitration,
he would face resentment of several
hundred thousand laboring men. If
he fails to bring about arbitration or a
settlement he will find himself faced
by a paralyzed transportation sys
tem, resulting in tremendous ' usiness
confusion and vast suffering. Hence,
friends of the' president are hoping
and praying that when the executive
board of the "big four" brotherhoods
and the general conference commit
tee of the roads resumes conferences
in New York. August 8. they may
come to some satisfactory agreement.
Administration officials, representa
tives of the roads and labor, however,
are nessimlstic over Dossible agree-
I ment at that conference. The presi
dent Is being kept informed promptly
of every move In the threatened crisis.
When, the vote of the trainmen is
counted and It Is assumed It will
favor a strike the TJnited States
board of mediation and conciliation
will at once offer its services. In the
event of this board failing to bring
peace and perhaps coincident with
the launching of its efforts the pres
ident may attempt to prevent the
strike.
TAX THEM OUT OF CITY
The city commission this morning
harkened to a cry from local mer
chants who sought protection from
itinerant vendors who temporarily
move stocks of samples Into the city
and solicit orders for future delivery.
Protection will be granted to the ex
tent that Itinerant merchants will be
compelled to pay a license fee of $100
a day before they can solicit business
in Topeka.
Relief is being granted local mer
chants through an amendment. Intro
duced for first reading this morning,
to an ordinance affecting peddlers and

London, Aug. 8. The fourih. Ger
man air raid on British east counties
occurred early today and like previous
excursions of like character, resulted
in little damage, according to first
official reports. Six or seven Zeppe
lins formed the squadron. They
dropped "a considerable number" of
bombs, according to the war office
statement, but exact reports of any
damage have not yet been received.
It is reported one of the raiders was
hit and badly damaged by anti-aircraft
guns. British patrols sighted the Zep
pelins very soon after they reached
points over British soil and anti-aircraft
guns opened at once. The diri
gibles flew at heights of from 3,000
to 5,000 feet.
In the fourth air raid in Mess than
seven days, British patrols were able
to sight the aerial invaders before
they passed over British soil. Warn
ings were sent broadcast over all the
east coast countries long before the
dirigibles appeared overhead.
Bombard Italian Port.
Rome, Aug. 3. An official . state
ment issued today says that two Aus

Italian seaport on the Adriatic near
Bart. The statement follows:
"Two enemy destroyers shelled Bis

$100,000 Campaign Fund Into
Balance for Hughes.
Denver. Colo., Aug. i. One hun
dred thousand dollars and the in
fluence of the National Woman's
party will be cast into the balance In
favor of Charles E. Hughes and
against President Wilson If the Demo
crats fall to pass the federal suffrage
amendment at the present session of
confress.
Miss Anne Martin, chairman of the
woman's party, stated to the United
Press here today:
' "We must -Judge the Democratic
party on its performance and the Re
publican party on its promises. Just
as we hold President Wilson to a strict
accountability for his suffrage record,
so we will hold Governor Hughes to
his promise of national suffrage, if ho
is elected.
Gain Women's Undying Loyalty.
"The leaders of the woman's party
are no babes in the woods. We realize
that politics and hope of victory may
have had a great deal to do with the
change in Governor Hughes toward
favoring national suffrage. But we
have not even a promise from the
Democrats. We have every confi
dence that as leader of his party Gov
ernor Hughes will keep his word. The
party tnat secures the political free
dom of all women will inevitably wit
the undying loyalty and adherence of
the women voters- Will the Democrats
give tnis great opportunity to the Re
publican party?"
Miss Martin is directing efforts to
raise a $100,000 campaign fund for
the woman's party.
Anticipating no satisfactory answer
from the Democrats she stated that
plans have been practically completed
for a vigorous campaign for the wom
an's party in the twelve suffrage states
in Denaii or tne republican party.
Miss Martin a Democrat, But
"I, myself am a Democrat," said
Miss Martin. "I would like to vote
for President Wilson. But as a mem- j
ber of the Woman's party my first in
terest is to secure national woman suf-
frage."
Two organizers of the Woman's
party have actually been at work for
months in each of the equal suffrage
states. One is in charge of state head
ouarters and works in co-operation
with the state and congressional dis
trict chairman. The second organizer
travels around the state and arranges
meetings for a corps of speakers rout
ed from national headquarters in Chi
cago. Miss Martin expects theconference of
the Woman's party in Colorado
Springs August 10-12 formally to de
clare for Hughes. Afterward the wo
man's campaign will be directly point
ed to help elect him.

U. S. EXPERTS GIVE RECIPES
Proper Grading and Draining
Secrets of Success.
Tell How to Surface "Sand-
Clay" Road In Country.
Washington, Aug. $. "Although It
will be impractical for many years to
come to improve more than a small
per cent of the roads of the country
with hard surfaces," said the United
States Office of Public roads today.
roads should' not be neglected, and
with a little care may in many cases
be made adequate to the needs of the
communities they serve."
Many country roads, the . govern
ment experts said, may be greatly im
proved by judicious grading and sys
tematic maintenance. "Frequently,
especially in the south, the addition of
sand or clay to the natural soil of the
road is all that is necessary to make
a road sufficiently good for all prac
tical purposes."
'Thousands of miles of roads that
meet the needs of many localities as
well as would a more expensive type
of construction have been built in the
south at an average cost of 1750 a
mile," the United States road service
said.
Arch One Inch to the Foot.
Earth roads should be at least
twenty feet wide and preferably twenty-four
to thirty feet; they should be
crowned with a rise of one inch to the
foot towards the center: they should
have side ditches; through swampy
land the road be should be raised
above the general level of the country
to secure drainage. For grading and
crowning the road, a drag made of
two halves of a split log is in general
use. The split-log drag is made by
Joining the halves in a vertical posi
tion and attaching chains and double
trees so taht when drawn by horses it
moves along the road at an angle of
45- degrees, the foremost end to the
side- of he road. M that the earth
may be directed toward tbe center.
How to Make a Road Drag.
The drag should be light enough to
be lifted by one man. Dry red cedar
Is the best material for the drag,
though red elm and walnut are excel
lent. Soft maple, elm or willow are
superior for this purpose to oak, hick
ory or ash. A platform may be placed
on the drag for the driver. Dragging
is simple and inexpensive, says the
government bureau, and when used In
conjunction with a road machine,
helps much toward the construction
of a good road. Dragging often costs
but 60 cents a mile. A mile of road
can be dragged In a few hours.
In constructing the sand-clay road,
a sand road is first shaped and then
covered with from four to six inches
of clay. The sand and clay are thor
oughly mixed with a tooth harrow.
first dry. then wet.
- On a clay roadbed, the same process
is followed with sand, except that the
clay should be well plowed up to in
sure a good mixture.

The final mixing should be done in

Complete returns from forty-nine of
iu counties late this afternoon give
Walter L, Payne of Burlingame a
strong lead for state treasurer, while
tne three candidates for state super
intendent are running neck and neck.
Both fights may go to the official
count. W. D. Ross has apparently
won for a third nomination for state
superintendent of public instruction.
Dark horse" candidates have made
a great showing in the primaries this
year. As a result of the long shot
races. It Is possible that two men well
outside the dope sheet may win.
Charles Evans of Goodland entirely
out of the advance dope is making
big gains and may be Payne's con
tender for the treasurship nomination,
although Matt Weightman of Topeka
is now in second place. Fred Knapp,
also out of the early reckoning, is now
the high candidate In the fight for
state auditor. Both Organ and Dyer
at e right at his heels.
From 49 Counties.
Complete returns had been received
at 8 oclock this afternoon frrm 49 of
the 106 counties. Failure of election
board to send abstracts of their vote
to county -clerks before seaillng the
election -returns, will delay reports
from many counties. The final count
from ovr the state will not be avail
able until Friday night, following the
report of the county canvassing
beards. " 1 ,

Official count. -
There Is little doubt that the offi
cial count will be required to settle the
dispute concerning state treasurer and
state auditor. Wylle W. Cook's early
leads have entirely vanished. This
afternoon he is fourth in the running.
Matt Weightman . position in second
place is in danger, as Charles Evans
of Goodland is making a great show
ing in the western counties.
Based on returns as received today,
it is probable that the finish fight for
state treasurer will be between Payne
and Evans. While Weightman is a
decidedly formidable candidate at this
time, his gains today have not been
nearly as consistent as those of the
Goodland , man. Payne checked in
with a number of strong counties and
held a safe lead all day. His lead of
6,800 over the nearest candidate gives
him an advantage hard to overcome.
Payne's big counties were Douglas,
Lyon, Marshall, Montgomery, Osage,
Pottawatomie, Reno. Sedgwick, Smith
and Washington. Wcightman's great
est strength came from Shawnee, al
though he carried Jefferson, Marion
and Leavenworth counties. Evans has
made a great race in the western
counties and surprised is friends in a
number of the big eastern counties.
He carried Brown, Franklin. Harvey,
Jewell, Linn, Lyon, Riley and Sum
ner counties.
Koss Renominated.
With a lead of more than 7,000 over
Miss Lizzie Wooster of Salina, W. D.
Icoss has doubtless been denominated
for a third term as Mate superintend
ent. The Salina woman carried trou
ble to Ross in a numoer of counties,
but the Ross strength was more posi
tive in all sections of the state and in
a three cornered race, Ross has doubt
less won a minority nomination.

this afternoon gave Knapp a alight

2,000 behind Khan p and within 1. -. 4
votes of Organ. With returns mlssii.g
from fifty-seven counties, any of the
three candidates may win the nom
ination. Organ's strength came chiefly from
the Third district and Wyandotte and
Shawnee counties. Douglas, Franklin,

ralities for Dyer. Knapp ran consist
ently in all sections of the state and
received big votes in former Progres
