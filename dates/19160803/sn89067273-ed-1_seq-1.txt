34 MULES ARE
BURNED TO DEATH
Animals Barred The Gate and Could
Not Be Liberated Vlre Caused
From (Spontaneous Combustion.
The large barn on the R. H. Buck
ner farm, 80x140 feet, ten miles
south of Mexico, was destroyed by
fire at two o'clock Saturday morning.
Thirty-four mules were housed In
the barn and all were lost. The Are
was discovered in time to have saved
the mules, perhaps, but the gate
opened inwardly and the excited an
Imajs pressed against it so tightly
that it was impossible to force it
open. Mr. Buckner values each
mule as being worth $210, and there
was not a cent of insurance. There
was $1,000 on the building. The
clear loss is about $11,000 The
mules were all fine fellows. All had
been bought up just recently. A
number of them were to go to tlfe
war, notably a pair bought from Jas.
Dowell, on -Long Branch.
Thirty-five acres of oats were
Btored in the barn. This perhaps, it
is thought, caused spontaneous com
bustion. THE WEATHER.

year, so far. The thermometer about
noon crawled up to 103. Later in the

WOODCRAFT STORIES
Fifteenth Story.
r By L. Roy Ferris.
Long, long time ago, before your grandmother's un
cle was born and before Reddy Squirrel had planted the
hickorynut that grew the scaly bark hickory tree which
has been the home of so many red squirrel families for
over a hundred years. Old Wiggly Fishworm made his
home in the rivers and lakes, and spent most of his time
playing with his cousin, Slimy Leech. One day when they
were playing "back-out" Wiggly climbed up on the bank
and sat down I mean he lav down under the shade of
a little tree that was only
looked sickly and weak, just like a little boy who spends
all his nickles for cream-puffs and candy and does not eat
cornbread and beans, and do you know what was the mat
ter? The ground was sick and sour, and the little tree
was sick, and when you put two sick fellows together all
they can talk about is their ills. So after Wiggley had rest
ed a while he called his playmates out on the land and they
had a barrel of fun playing "Sheep-meet'' and hide and go
seek. One little fellow dug a hole in the ground at the
roots of the little tree and hid, and when he came out he
made another hole close to the little .tree, and. of course,
what one fellow does another will do, so they all hid in
the ground except the catcher who counted "10, jo, 30",
on up to 100, and "all eyes are open, here I come," when
he dug a hole to find them. They all came out of new
holes and crawled to the base as fast as they could crawl.
The next day it rained, and the rain and sunshine and air
followed the little holes in the ground the worms had made
and the little tree raised its head and began to shoot out
little tender roots and grow, like a boy that has spent the
summer visiting his aunt.
One funny thing about fishing worms is they have
three gizzards, which is two more than Old l'etsey, the
hen, and some fish worms had gills when they used to
swim in the water. The gills disappeared after they had
lived on the land a while. The fish worm helps make the
ground so the little radish seeds will burst their jackets
and grow up. In a few days Toinmie goes out in the gar
den and brings in a basket-ful of round, red radishes that
Lis, if the neighbor's chickens haven't. been there first.

ture smiles when they get thru with their work. The little
trees and grass that were stunted and dwarfed began to
grow and said they were so
come to live with them. Old Mr. Wiggley retused to go
back and live with his cousin, the leech, and the fishing
worm turned out to be our first real farmers. Of course
they don't wear blue overalls, like Uncle John, but they
begin work in the morning like he does and they work all
day long and they work awfully hard.
Robin Redbreast knows what early risers they are.
and he gets up in the morning while Bunny Rabbit is still
snoozing in his bunch of grass and before Brother Xight
hawk and Dr. Owl have really gone to bed, and he catches
the fish worms and then alights in a tree near the little
sick girl's window and sings the sweetest little song, that
cheers the little girl, even tho she cannot go and play like
you and I.
You see the fish worms perform their mission in the
world. In fact, we can't get along without them.
Sometime when you become the president of a bank 1
you will look back on a picture ot a boy in a hickory hat
and blue overalls sitting on the creek bank in the dearest
spot down where the old willow leans over the water close
to the big spotted sycamore; you will then realize what
old Wiggley Fishing Worm has xlone for you.
