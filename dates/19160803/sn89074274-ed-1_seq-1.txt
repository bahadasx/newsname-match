Last week the Kathryn Farmers'
Elevator company let the contract for
the erection of a 50,000-bushel capacity
elevator, flour mill and power house.
"The successful bidder was the J. B.
Nelson Construction company, of Man
kato, Minn.
The same company has the contract
for the Valley City Grocery company
warehouse here, and N. A. Nelson, who
is the foreman on this job, will also
•have charge of the work at Kathryn.
The plans as shown by Mr. Nelson
call for a circular concrete elevator
with a diameter of 43 feet and a
height of 94.7. There is to be an area
way in the center from top to bottom
with a diameter o£ 12 feet, affording
light and connection with every bin,
of which there are 20.
This structure will be unique in the
matter of elevators, as the design is
patented by the architect, J. H. A.
Brahtz, of St. Paul, and will be the
first of the kind to be erected in the
United States.
In connection with the elevator a
two-story flour mill will be erected and
also a power house. The elevator and
mill are to be operated entirely by
electricity, each to be fitted with the
latest electrical machinery and ap
pliances.
Work is expected to commence as
soon as material can be assembled,
whjch will probably be about three
-weeks.
When completed the enterprise will
call for an outlay approximating
$60,000.
That the directors and stockholders
of the elevator company should un
hesitatingly decide to install such a
plant speaks well for the progressive
ness of that community, and is a de
cided boost for the prospects of Kath
ryn and that part of Barnes county.
Mueller Case Will
Go to Higher Court
Jamestown, July 29.—Today Judge
J. A. Coffey pronounced sentence upon
John Mueller for the murder of Val
entine Hens. He was sentenced to 30
years in the state penitentiary. Stay
of execution was granted, however, to
give time for his attorneys to prepare
an appeal. In court today Attorney
Knauf stated that he would move for
a new trial.
It is considered doubtful whether
Judge Coffey will grant the petition,
although if the defense can show
that the deliberations of the jury
were interfered with or that there
"were other irregularities in the trial,
it will doubtless be granted.
If the motion is denied, said Mr.
Knauf, an appeal will be taken to the
state supreme court.
Miss Lillian Bush entertained a
number of children on Monday after
noon in honor of her niece, Miss Doro
thy Krug, and also Frances and Fred
erick Wanner, of Bismarck, who are
visiting in the city at the Moe home
on Ninth avenue. There were about
16 present, and games were played
from 3 until 6 o'clock, when delicious
refreshments were served. Assisting
the hostess in serving were the Misses
Kate Bush and Alline Deming. A
most enjoyable afternoon was spent
by the children.
Barnes County Prisoner
Escapes From State Pen
Bismarck, July 30.—Three prisoners
at the state penitentiary escaped Sat
urday afternoon by building a little bin
for themselves in the end of a coal
car and riding out with the empty
train.
This is the fifth escape within two
months, 17 prisoners in all having
gotten their freedom two, however,
were recaptured men who escaped
again. The largest number escaping
at one time was last Saturday, when
eight crawled through a hole whica
they made in the brick wall and es
caped. Three of these were recaptur
ed the same night.
The men who escaped yesterday
are Harry Woodworth, who was
committed from Foster county for
forgery, for one year, on Dec. 3, 1915.
He would have been out if he had not
been penalized for bad conduct. Wil
liam Brunner, committed from Ward
county, five years and six months, for
burglary. Charles Tilwickie, commit
ted from Barnes county, five years,
for robbery in the first degree.
Rewards of $50 each are offered for
the delivery of any one of them into
the hands of an authorised officer of
the penitentiary.
The escape occurred about 3 o'clock
and the alarm was sounded. All avail
able prison officials were out at once
and at an early hour this morning it
was believed a clue was being fol
lowed that would result in the early
capture of two of them.
Charles Tilwickie was one of the
four men who perpetrated a holdup at
the high line depot last fall, boarding
a freight immediately after and hold
ing up the laborers on the freight.
They made the mistake of riding the
freight to Jamestown, where they were
captured within a few hours. They
were a bunch
of
bad men and It is to
be hoped that Tilwickie will be cap
tured soon.

Weary Willies Making
Midsummer Demands
Sunday evening word was received
from North Valley City that about
150 I. W. W. gents had congregated
and demanded a free ride west on
train No. 107 on the Soo. Officers
Swanson and King went over and held
them at a proper distance while the
train pulled out. There was no trou
ble to amount to anything, but it looks
as though there will be lots of it be
fore the harvest and threshing is fin
ished. Many places in the state are
arming and preparing to handle these
outlaws, and Valley City may well take
notice and be ready for emergencies.

African Missionary Visits
With Litchville Relatives
Litchville Bulletin: Litchville has a
visitor this week who is back to civi
lization after spending two years in
the heart of equatorial Africa, in the
Belgian Congo state, as a missionary
doctor.
Our visitor is Dr. Thomas T. Stlx
rud, cousin of our Dr. Stixrud, who ar
rived here Sunday after a twenty
thousand mile trip by water and rail.
He will remain about three or four
weeks to recuperate from the ener
vating tropical climate. Dr. Stixrud
was here for several weeks two years
ago and is well known to many of oui
citizens.
Dr. Stixrud is located 1,200 miles up
the Congo river, in the heart of the
rubber producing country, and has
many interesting experiences to relate.
The first four hundred miles of the
trip from the coast is made by rail, as
the cataracts in the river make navi
gation impossible. Above the cata
racts the other eight hundred miles
are made by river boats. Hippos and
crocodiles are frequently seen in the
river- and once in awhile herds of
wild elephants are seen on the banks.
The doctor brought a trunk full of
curios from the dark continent.
The center of population where he
is located contains about 60,000 blacks,
living in mud huts, within an area of
five miles square. Skin diseases,
sleeping sickness and leprosy are the
most prevalent diseases tuberculosis
is very rare. There is a rainy season
of eight months and a dry season the
balance of the year.
Dr. Strixrud left Congo May 5 and
landed in New York July 4, traveling
almost continuously for 62 days.

Right Price Mercantile Co.'s
Sale Proving Big Winner
Manager Peterson, of the Right
Price Mercantile Co., reports that
their remodeling sale has proved very
successful. The Times-Record does
not need to point out that the store's
reputation for honest merchandising,
gained by genuine service to the peo
ple of Barnes county for the past
quarter century, is a big factor in its
success. We do feel rather chesty,
the same, over the success of the sale,
which was advertised by a page ad. in
both Daily and Weekly Times-Record,
supplemented by bills from our job
department.
As the title indicates, this big sale
presages a remodeling of the big store.
It is to be made uptodate in every par
ticular. But that is a separate story,
because the details are not yet com
pleted. We will tell you all about it
when everything has been arranged
for.

Thermometer Registered 112
Thursday afternoon, a little after 5,
the Straus Clothing Co.'s thermometer
on the west side of the building regis
tered 112 degrees. That seems to have
been the limit the needle travels, and
possibly the temperature was really
some degrees higher. It is reported
that Thursday was the hottest day in
the last four years over the plains
states. However, the humidity was
not so great as for several previous
days and the great heat was not so
noticeable.
The Minneapolis papers report th^t
the maximum heat record was equal
led in that city.

favor of Valley City.
Nels Nelson, of Leal, was in the city
