We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value.

BIG SUM READY FOR ROAD WORK
Ravlin Tells of Events at Monday Meeting
of State Highway Commission
Meeting.
Plans, characterized by G. N. Ravlin.
bo with Leslie Butler represented
Hood River at the conference, as being
the eclipse of any former good roads
movement in the atate ' of Oregon,
whereby the Oregon State Highway
Commission, the United Statea Foreat-
7.
UeDartment and the United States
ar Department, will undertake the
construction of roads on an immense
scale, were revealed at a meeting of
the Highway Commission in Salem
Monday. And as a result of action
taken at the Salem meeting, construc
tion work on the completion of the Co
lumbia river highway unit between
this city and the Multnomah county
line and on the aection of the Loop
highwax between the Homer A. Rog
ers' Mount Hood Lodge and the old
Barlow road, involving the probable
expenditure of $381,000, may bo under
way by the first of September.
illation over gratifying events has
never before been so keenly felt in
Hood River 'as has been evidenced by
representative business men in their
expressions on learning news from the
state Highway Commission.
At an impromptu meeting held last
Thursday evening at the Commercial
Club, when good roads enthusiasts con
ferred with Amos S. Benson and J. B.
Yeon, of Portland, as to possible plans
for securing an appropriation from the
State Highway Commission for the
elimination of the Ruthton hill grade
just west of town, it was decided to
send Mr. Ravlin and Mr. Butler to Sa
lem Monday to ask that an appropria
tion, set aside for expenditure on the
east extension of the Colombia river
highway, between here and Mosier. be
diverted to the road work in this coun
ty. The state aid appropriation, orig
inaly amounting to $45,000, but which
had been decreased to an approximate
$40,000 by the diverting of funds for
surveys in other sections of the state,
was made with the provision that Was
co county, in order to obtain the bene
fits, would vote bonds for road im
provement. The local men, in asking
for the money, were prepared to pre
sent the argument that the citizens of
the neighboring county had postponed
their vote on the proposed bond issue
until the general election in November,
and that after that date it would be
too late to accomplish much with the
fund at hand this year.
We had gone to baiem. aays Mr.
Ravlin, "with some hope of getting at
least a portion of that $40,000. The
results of the real accomplishments of
the meeting are ao big that 1 acarcely
know where to begin to tell you of all
that happened."
The events transpiring Monday came
as a climax of efforts on the part of
the Portland Chamber of Commerce
and representatives of the United
States Forestry Department during the
past year. Last autumn the proposed
Loop highway, to be made possible by
the opening of the road up the East
Fork of Hood river and extending to
the old Barlow road, thus connecting
the Columbia river highway with the
route leading out from Portland to the
south side of Mount Hood, received its
first material stimulus when a party of
Chamber ot Commerce reDresentaties.
Forestry officials and local good roads
men, made a tour of investigation on
muleback and hosreback. Since that
time, as was evidenced Monday, the
Chamber of commerce and the forest
ry Department have been carrying on
a silent but ceaseless campagin, look
ing to the ultimate construction of the
roads.
"We of Hood River want to extend
unstinted thanks to Portland men for
their aid Monday." says Mr. Ravlin.
"Without their backing we would
never have gained the least headway
Amos S. Benson, by arranging for the
Portland delegation, carried the plans
through to success. When the names
of S. Benson Amos S. Benson and John
B.Yeen.all of whom were present, were
mentioned, and it was stated that they
were favorable to the plana as outlined
and put into effect. Thomas B. Kay, mem
ber of the Highway Commission, said
'I consider that you three men have
done more for highways in Oregon
than all the reBt ot us in the state
combined, and your approval is enough
to win mv favor for the plan.
Other men present at the conference
were: E. E. Coovert. Geo. Joseph,
,'egal adviser of the Chamber of Com
merce: Jacob Kanzier, cnairman oi
the Civic Committee of the Chamber
of Commerce : T. H. Sherrard, state
forest supervisor, and b. J. fincn,
senior road engineer in department of
roads for forestry service.
The members oi the forestry ier
vice in the oast year's time have com
pleted surveys, made investigations
and prepared arguments in anticipation
of Monday's meeting. In fact, all
necessary steos bad been taken, ana a
.brief of their plans were already en
mute to Washington.
The plans of the proposed Loop

almost immediately. The first points
of attack will be Kothton hill grade,
just west of Hood River, and Eden hill
at Viento. The aurveys of the exten
sion of the Columbia river highway at
these points have already been made
by Engineer J. A. Elliott, working un
der the State Highway Commission.
United Statea Road Engineer Finch has
asked State Highway Engineer Lewis
to assign Mr. Elliott to the Kutbton
snd Eden hills construction, because of
his familiarity with the topograhy of
the country. Mr. Elliott had charge of
the construction or the Mitchells Point
tunnel.
The application of the State High
way Commission, signed by Governor
Withycombe and with the approval of
ttorney General Brown.waa mailed to
Washington Tuesday. The opinion is
expressed by the Portland men and the
forestry officials thst they should be
spproved and returned here within
three weeks. It is proposed to adver
tise, in the meantime, for bids on the
work, and be prepared to let the eon
tracts by the time of the receipt of the
duly approved application for the fed
eral fnnd."
The Oregon national forests, accord
ing to Mr. Ravlin. have available the
sum of $225,000 to be expended on roads
within national forests. This full
amount will be used on the Loop high
way. The Forestry Service will take
immediate charge and start operations
near Mount Hood Lodge. While the
Columbia river highway will be graded
and paved a full 24 feet wide, when
complete, on a maximum grade of Ave
per cent, the road in the national forest
will be 20 feet wide with the grade in
no place exceeding four per cent.

President Wilson contains the following
data, showing final cost of respective
units, when graded and paved: Mult
nomah county line to Hood River.

$115,000.
"It ia shown." Bays Mr. Ravlin.
'that the citizens and officials of Mult
nomah county will take care of the
construction of their portion of the
road. They have expressed the will
ingness to turn to Hood River county
any aid that may come to them for
building of the Loop highway.
In the course of the meeting. Mr.
Ravlin states. Engineer Finch explain
ed to the State Highway Commission
and those present the complete plan of
the government to assist in construc
tion of roada through Oregon, connect
ing with the Lincoln highway at On
tario. This main transcontinental line,
extending through Idaho and giving
access to the National parks will pass
through Ontario and thence to Vale and
the Dalles. Mr. f inch further showed
that the United States War Depart
ment was contemplating the construe
tion of a military road, beginning at
Astoria and proceeding south through
Oregon and California to San tran
CISCO.
"In the course of his talk," aaya Mr.
Ravlin, "Mr. Finch stated that the
route would extend along the Pacific
the entire distance and, Bince it would
be open to traffic the entire year, would
form the most popular scenic route
between Oregon and California."
It takes some deliberation," con
tinues Mr. Ravlin, "for us in Hood
River to realize the immensity of these
plans and to grasp comprehensively
how fortunately we are situated. But
we must not lay down and consider that
everything has already been accom
pushed, we must keep on at work and
by every available means show our in
terest."
Judge Stanton was in Salem also
Monday to make a plea for aid at Ruth
ton hill. Judge Stanton addressed the
Commission, however, and returned to
Portland before the ultimate and con
elusive deliberation was entered upon.
