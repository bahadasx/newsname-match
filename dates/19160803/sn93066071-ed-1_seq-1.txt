Monday, although Madam Rumor ex

little scheming and foolcJ the princi

principals had fooled them. Leading
them to believe that Urn next night
would bo the occasion of a charivari,
they pulled it off Monday night.
Armed with tin pans, skillets, and
other noiie-maklng paraphernalia, tho
crowd of friends (V) the parcnthetW

PROBST GRAIN COMPANY ADD TO
ELEVATOR.
An additiou to, t'-e Probst Grain
Company's elevator, large enough to
hold 20,000 bushels, has just been com
pleted this week. This company has
always been very progressive and ex
hibited great faith in the future of
Beaver and Beaver eoutity and this Is
added evidence of the fact Their fa
cilities have been Improved until they
are able to take care of all grain that
pi ay come to them in tho course of
business.
Siys the Beaver County Republican :
"Even the peaceful littla town Of Gray
contains a two-legged skunk, that is
such a Ion -down, contemptible coward
it will walk right past a man without
molesting him and then turn and hit
him in the bak of the necu " Which
makes us wonder about two things,
one of them being a question as to
who has been treating our brother ed
itor so badly as to bring out a howl
like that, and the other as to when the
animal referred to so radlcalcy ohang
ed his method of attack.
Congressman Dick T. Morgan en
