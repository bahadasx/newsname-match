itician than a statesman.

pected start Tuesday night. How far

The English mav not have a deep
sense of humor, but they sometimes
unintentionally raise a laugh. They

Rocrer Casement, convicted of trca
son. It is not known whether he
will use a dull razor or talk him to
death.
Yesterday everything was reported
in readiness- for the execution of Sir
Roger Casement, who is to be hanged

MAYOR YOST
RESIGNS
Retires From The Office He
Has Filled For Two
Years.
BASSETT MAYOR PRO TEM
Resignation Came As A Com
plete Surprise To The
Public.
At the regular meeting of the Board
of Commissioners of the City Tues
day, Mayor Frank K. Yost tendered
his resignation by handing in the fol
lowing communication;
Hopkinsville, Ky., Aug. 1, 1910.
To the City Commissioners:
Feeling that the city should have
the services of a business man who
can give all his time to the duties of
the office, I tender my resignation as
Mayor of Hopkinsville, same to be
effective at once.
Yours truly,
F. K. YOST.
The resignation came as a surprise
to the public, but Commissioners W.
R. Wicks and Frank H. Bassett had
known for some time that Mayor Yost
was tmnking seriously oi giving up
his office, which had been1 exempted
from the operations of the new law.
While the comminssionars are re
quired to give their entire time to the
duties of their offices, the mayor has
been operating under the old law
that did not exact this. His salary is
$600 a year, while the commissioners
receive $1800 u year.
Mayor Yost was elected by the last
City Council for the term beginning
Jan. 5, 1914, and ending in January,
1918. Seventeen months remain of
the term and under the law it will be
necessary to appoint his successor at
the old salary of $600, which cannot '
be changed during the term of .office.
Some lawyers hold that the Governor
...Ml i Iwi irvli4 lr nrrntty np tiwlp
Will lldVU tllG 11114. IU ClfJWUll, to UJ
done in the Paducah case under
somewhat similar circumistances.
Others hold that an election will have
to be held, although the office was not
originally filled by election but by
appointment, ami the term is now
more than half out.
City Attorney James Breathitt has
not yet prepared an official statement
giving his final opinion as to the con -

election of a new commissioner. He
stated yesterday that the election
would be held at the regular No
vember election, according to law,
but he remained in doubt as to wheth
er the Mayor protem would retain
that place or the newly elected Com
missioner would be elected as mayor. '
He was inclined to believe that tiie
election in November would bo lield ;
for mayor. " I
Mayor protem Frank Bassett stated
yesterday that a commissioner to a t
until the election would, probably bu
selected at the regular meeting of -the i
commissioners on next Tuesday. j
Mayor Yost during his incumbency j
of the office has made an excolleat
mayor, giving to the city a wise and j
intelligent administration of mattors ;
coming under his jurisdiction. He ;
is presidont and general manager of ;
the Hopkinsville Milling Compaliy,
and is one of the city's successful!
business mou.

BATTLE RAGES
E
Violent Fighting Continues
from Pripet River in Rus
sia to Buczacz, Galicia.
WEST BANK OF STOKHOD
Comparative Quiet Prevails
on Front in France---Ger-man
Attacks Repulsed.
London, Aug. 2. Violent battles
arc still being fought by -the Russians
and the Austrc-Hungarian and Ger
man forces virtually on the entire
front from Pripet river marshes in
Russia southward to the region of
Buczacz in Galicia a distance of
about 200 piles.
The second anniversary of Ger
many's declaration of war on Russia
finds the relative positions of the bel
ligerents very different from those of
the first anniversary. The entente al
lies are now pursuing a successful of
fensive on all fronts and the central
powers are virtually everywhere on
the defensive.
Emperor William celebrated the oc
casion by the issue of proclamations
to his army and navy and people
which breathed a spirit of continued
confidence in ultimate victory for
Germany.
The operations on the eastern front
continue to surpass those in the west
in dramatic interest. The military
critics express great admiration for
the Russian tactics, one of the im
portant objects of which, in their
opinion has been to isolate the Aus-
trians from the German armies on the
Russian front. This, now is claimed,
has been virtually accomplished.
The view here is that if the Ger
mans have thus accepted severance
from the Austrians, the most decisive
result of the whole of the Russian
General Brussiloff's strategy will have
been obtained.
The critics say that the Austrian
forces between the Lipa and Dniester
' rivers are doomed. There has been

employes under the provisions of that
legislation. The following have al
ready signed their papers subjecting
them to the requisites and benefits of
the laws c-f the insurance companies

erate with five or more employes, ex
cepting agricultural and domestic em
ployes. The insurance is taken out by the
employer and a heavy penalty is im
posed if any employe is charged up
with tho cost of the insurance policy.
The rate of insurance is figured on
tho annual payroll of wages paid by
the employer.

I. SUFFRAGE!
Twice Declares for Amend
ment to Federal Consti
tution Granting Votes.
ADVISES "SHORTEST CUT"
Again Assails Policy Concern
ing American Rights
Abroad.
New York, Aug. 2. Charles E.
Hughes yesterday declared himself
in favor of an amendment to the fed
eral constitution granting the vote to
women throughout the United States.
In a letter to Senator Sutherland, of
Utah, sent in response to a telegram,
Mr. Hughes stated his personal view
that the proposed amendment should
be submitted by congress to the states
and ratified. In a speech before 500
women of the women's Roosevelt
league for Hughes, the nominee de
clared the question was one affecting
the whole country and that he favored
taking the shortest cut to its solu
tion."
"I believe this question should be
promptly settled," Mr. Hughes said,
"I see nothing but danger to our se
curity, to our unity, to our proper
attitude toward political questions, in
continued agitation of this subject."
In his address to the league, Mr.
Hughes again assailed the adminis
tration for its policy concerning Amer
ican rights abroad during the Euro
pean war.
"There is an incurable defect of
character in the administration with
respect to the weakness and vacilla
tion which have characterized it,"
Mr. Hughes said, "and we cannot ex
pect improvement from that source.
We ran judge by what has been done
and by what has not been done; and
we arc here together under circum
stances very unexpected to me to see
if we cannot have a genuine revival
of American sentiment so we may
facethe world erect and prepared. "
Nothing to Offer.
Republican leaders in Washington
manifested disappointment at the
speech of Charles E. Hughes, accept
ing the presidential nomination in its
failure to offer any constructive pol
icy or to suggest improvement on the
i-
tUlministration he so severely ar
raigned.

States Infantry, stationed at El Paso,
