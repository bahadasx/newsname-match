The Fair
For hundreds of years the Fair has been a great in
stitution for country people. It comes at a time when
work is a little slack, and when crops are coming in and
fruit is abundant. And it gives a chance to see and to be
seen, to meet neighbors from a distance, and to get new
things to talk about
There are always two tendencies and two crowds at
a Fair. One set of people are interested in learning
something from the exhibits, and in enjoying the music
and the speaking. Another set are slinking off into
secret places to drink and gamble.
On the whole these drinkers and gamblers are to be
pitied as much as they are to be blamed. If they only
knew the higher pleasures they would not seek the lower
ones. It is because parents, teachers and churches have
failed in some way that we have people in this Christian
land who want to drink and gamble.
Let us try to make goodness more interesting to
everybody!
Road Improvement
By Prof. John F. Smhh
Good Roads a Source ot Pride
At the name time good roads
are a source of pride and a neces
sity to the community. When peo
ple who have helped to make a
gfmd road travel on it they en
joy a satisfaction and feel a delight
that can hardly come from travel
ing elsewhere. They like to talk
about it just ax they like to talk
about a new achoolhouse, a beautiful
church, or an artistic bridge. If the
road are had they usually feel some
'what ashamed of them and usually
avoid the subject of roads when tell
ing of the things the community
has to offer as attractions to the
proepective land-purchaser or the
promoter of new business.
When travelers from a distance
pas overland through a region new
to them they at once express opin
ions about the roads and the people
who made them. If te roads are
good the travelers may not always
say very much about them, but they
will ronrlode that a prosperous and
progressive people live there. If
the roads are had they are almost
certain to he condemned in pretty
strong terms and the people will
meet likely be railed lunkheads or
shiftless and poverty-stricken. The
people 01 ine roniniinniy enjoy mu
praise nui iney (iisiiKe io iii'u

A Source of Pride to States and
Rations
The people of ancient Egypt, Per
sia, Ituhylonia and other countries
were good road-builders and took
special pride in their highways. So
did the people of the great Roman
Empire. The latter built roads for
military purpose as well as for the
exchange of commodities and in this
way bound all their vast domains
closer together. Some of these fam
ous highways built in Italy, France,
England and elsewhere were so well
const rurled that they are still in use.
The line of march of some of the
great Russian, Turkish and English
armies in the countries east of the
Mediterranean Sea during the Euro
pean War have been along routes
laid out by the Romans before the
birth of Christ. '
What nation would not be proud
of a great highway built so well
thatit would last two thousand
years I
When the Spaniards conquered
Peru some four hundred years ago,
a nation inhabited by so-called sav
ages, a great system of splendid
roads was found connecting all parts
of the empire. No doubt the Peru
vians felt a just pride in these high
ways and told about them to all
travelers who chanced to come with-

Teutons Rush to Defense of
Gaticlan Lines.
BRITISH IMPROVE POSITION
Muscovites Cross Entire Stretch ef
Stokhod River Between Kevel-Sarny
and Kovel-Rohltche Railroad Seo-
tore Teutone Bombard Bredy.
London, "Aug. 1. The Iron clutch
of General Brusllolf's northern army
around Hovel, the great fortified city
m the heart of Volhynla, where Ave
of the most Important Russian rail
ways converge, has been ominously
tightened during the last twenty-four
hours. The Russians have crossed
the entire stretch of the Stokhod
river between the Kovel-8arny and
Kovel-Rohltche railroad sectors. Thus
they have overcome the laat natural
obstacle In the road to Kovel from
the east. The succeaa was announced
by the Petrograd war office.
Simultaneously with this advance,
the most important In Volhynla since
the fall of Lutzk and Dtibno, Brusl
loff's Gallcian army has swept south
ward from Brody, taken last Friday,
and moving along the northeastern
border of Oalicta have reached the
rivers Graberkl and Sereth, thus ad
vancing fifteen miles further toward
Lember, the OaTlctan capital, for the
northernmost point of the Sereth lies
nineteen miles south of Brody and
forty-three miles due east of Lemberg.
One of the fiercest battles of the
war le now In progress on the front
south of Brody. The Teutons, realis
ing that still further Russian head
way In Galicla will spell the fall of
Lemberg within a short period of time
and evidently convinced that Kovel
la still safe, are throwing their might
and main Into the defense of the Ga
llcian lines. "With this aim," says
the Russian official statement, "the
enemy la bringing up all available
reinforcements from every sector,
even separate battalions.'
The statement speaka of "desper
ate and sanguinary combats" on the
front south of Brody. The Teuton
have launched a heavy bombardment
on Brody. probably with a view to
recapturing the town.
An entire Honved (Hungarian) regi
ment, the Thirty-first, with Its com
mander and staff, was taken prisoner
by the Russians in the Stokhod fight
ing. There, too, the Teutons have let
loose an inferno of Iron and steel
against the advancing Russians.
Road to Kovel Opened.
Now that the Stokhod Is crossed,
however, the road to Kovel is open
and the advance is facilitated by two
excelleiU-roads which, with the Stok
hod. form the triangle In which the
fate of Kovel is being decided in bat
tles that are no less furious than those
raging south of Brody and west and
south of Stanlslau, In southern Galicla,
though In that region there seems to
be a lull at present
The Russian army, aiming at Kovel
from the west, faces Its objective to
the form of a great nutcraoker, the
ahape being determined by the Stok
hod. Bruslloff's strategy, too, Is that
of a nutcracker, gradually bearing
down the two arms upon the objec
tive, squeezing the defenders Into
flight or surrender.
The front on which the Russians
crossed the Stokhod Is twenty-eight
miles long, If the bend ts included.
Berlin asserted officially that strong
Russian assaults on Oeneral von Lin-
slogan's lines, "In massed formation,1
all broke down under the Are of the
defease, with "heaviest loses to the
attackers.
In the Caucasus the Russians claim
further progress near Eritngan and
the repulse of a Turkish attaok In the
Mosul region.
The British Improved their post
tlona along the Somme, small bodies
of troops gaining outposts on the plat
eau to the north of Bazentin-le-Petlt.
North of the Somme the Germans re
doubled their counter attacks be
tween Hemwood and Monacu farm,
according to the Paris war statement.
The struggle was especially severe
around Monacu farm where the Ger
mans obtained a temporary footing.
They were soon driven out, however.
At Hemwood the German assaults
were repulsed by French counter at
tacks and at the same time the French
batteries on the left bank ot the
Somme enfiladed the German troops.
Inflicting great losses.
The eaatern and southeastern coun
ties of England had a visitation from
German airships late Monday night
and at this hour the attack is still
proceeding. An offlolal communlca
ties lust Issued says: "An attack by
a number of hostile airships developed
before midnight. The raiders are re
ported as having crossed southeastern
counties. Bombs were dropped off the
Thames estuary."
WORLD HEWS
Desperate rountcr-alt.-tck have
been made by the Germans against
the English to prevent their drive
on the western frontier of the war,
along the Somme River. Thus far
the English have held their posi
tions. The conflict hns been a
band to hand fight.
The Austrian armies have been re
treating before the Russians on the
east and the Italians on the south.
The Hermans are not able, as former
ly, to shift reenforcemenls from one
place to another and thus play off
the enemy but they must now meet
a united crushing advance.
A curious rumor has been in cir
culation throughout England .dur
ing the week to the effect that Lord
Kitchener is not dead but is se
cretly directing the united drive of
the allies against Germany, and that
the report of his drowning was a
pretense to deceive the enemy.
There is, however, little ground for
such a belief.
A decision has just been reached
by the Court of Admiralty that the
Appam, the English vessel brought
by the Germuns into Norfolk har
bor, cannot be held as a German
prize. It will be remembered that
the vessel was seized at sea, her crew
taken captive and a German crew
put in charge of the boat to direct
her into port, evading the English
cruisers that were watching, for
enemy veiscls.
A request has been made by the
officers of the German submarine
merchantman, Detitchland, that she
be given protection by the Ameri
cans after she leaves American wat
ers. Our officials refuse to do this
or to treat her in any way different
from any merchant vessel. It will
be proper to see that she receives no
injury in her voyage down the
Chesapeake Day.
The German National Committee
are to begin a campaign of speaking
throughout the Empire. The general
subject will have to do with the aims
of peace and there is apparent a
disposition to allow greater freedom
of speech than has been enjoyed up
to this time. Other Committees are
also to send out speakers and thus
many of the leading men of the Em
pire will be engaged in the cam
paign. The British Ambassador assures
the United States that the black
listing will be confined to those
firms namjd in the lists and that no
neutral firm will be affected or in
terfered with in its trading with
blacklisted firms unless it seeks to
act systematically as a cover for the
blacklisted firm in aiding the enemy.
The President and his advisors
feel so sure that Mexico will accept
their proposal for a general consid
eration of all important issues at
stake between the two nations by a
Joint Commission that they are se
lecting the men to act on such Com
mission. The name of the new Su
preme Justice Itraudcis is being men
tioned for a place on the Commis
sion. , , . i
WARNING IS SENT TO BRITAIN.
Washington Great Britain is warn
ed, in the American note of protest,
against the blacklist, made public by
the State Department, of the "many
serious consequences to neutral right
and neutral relations which such an
act must necessarily involve." Al
ready In the hands of the British For
eign Office, the note declares "In the
gravest terms" that it la "manifestly
out of the question that the govern
men of the United States should ac
quiesce in such methods," and that
the United States regards the black
list as "Inevitably and essentially
inconsistent with the rights of all the
citizens of all the nations not Involved
In the war." It reminds the British
government that "citisens of the Uni
ted States are entirely within their
rights In attempting to trade with the
people of the governments of any of
the nations bow at war, subject only
to well-deOnad international practice
and understandings which the govern
ment of the United States deems the
government of Great Britain to have
too lightly and freely disregarded."
The American note is even more
positive in its terms than officials have
Intimated. Ambassador Page was In
structed by Acting Secretary Polk to
deliver it formally and textually.
