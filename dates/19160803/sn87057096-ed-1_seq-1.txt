County auditor Walter Osborn, as
well as the balance of the county
not peeved over the action of the
state executive council in making a
big increase in the valuations of live
stock, the increase in Decatur coun
ty varying from 9 per cent on year
ling heifers to 94 per cent on stal
lions. At a recent meeting of the
board of supervisors acting as a
board of equalization they made sev
eral changes in order to equalize the
various townships and they thought
they had the valuations high enough.
But it seems the state executive coun
cil desires to raise more money as
taxes, and not desiring to increase
the state levy, they have made a big
increase in valuations which will
bring in many thousands of dollars
in additional revenue. The total in
crease in the value of live stock as
returned by the assessors and equal
ized by the board of supervisors, in
Decatur county, amounts to almost a
half million dollars, to be exact,
$447,203.44, and the farmers will
have to pay taxes on this additional
valuation. Take horses for example:
The average valuation as assessed of
all the horses three years old or over
in Decatur county was $64.34. The
executive council has ordered an in
crease of 4 9 per cent in the valua
tion which makes the average valua
tion $95.S7. When the fact that
many of the horses used on the
farms are not valuable animals, and
that the bulk of the best horses have
been sold to horse buyers, it looks
to us as if this was a pretty high
valuation, and we doubt very much
whether they would bring this valua
tion on the market
Yearling colts which were assess
ed at $32.18, are increased 22 per
cent. The value of all the colts as
assessed was $54,012, and this in
creases it to $65,894.64.
Two year old colts were assessed
at $52.40, with a total valuation of
$80,380, and these are increased 43
per cent, a total of $114,943.40.
Horses three years old and ovor
were assessed at $64.34, the total val
uation being $4S5,432, and they are
increased 43 per cent, making the to
tal $723,293.68.
Stallions were assessed at $200.44,
and are increased 94 per cent., the
valuation was $17,960, and the in
crease makes it $34,842.40.
Mules assessed at an average of
$62.70. with a total valuation of
$60,528, are increased 59 per cent,
which brings the valuation up to
$1(6,239.52.
Yearling heifers assessed at $20.26
with a total valuation of $63,376, are
increased 9 per cent, making a total
valuation of $69,079.»4.
Two year old heifers assessed at
$24.70, with a total valuation of
$56,2 84, are increased 13 per cent,
making the total valuation $63,600.-
Cows which were assessed at
i?32.49, with a total valuation of
$358,220, are increased 11 per cent,
which increases the valuation to
$397,624.20.
Yearling steers assessed at $24.02,
with a total valuation of $73,180,
are increased 17 per cent, which
makes the total valuation $85,620.60.
Two year old steers assessed at
$35.60, with a total valuation of
$75,076, are increased 12 p^r cent,
increasing the total valuation tc
$84, OSS.
12.
Three year old steers assessed at
$40.18, with a valuation of -7,1.7 6,
are increased 20 per cent, which
makes the total valuation $9,211.20.
Bulls assessed at $41.32, with a
total valuation of $20,124, are in
creased 14 per cent, which increases
the valuation to $22,941.36.
Hogs assessed at $8.24 a head,
with a total valuation of $134,696,
are increased 22 per cent, making
the total valuation $164,329.12.
Sheep assessed at $4.03, with a
valuation of $37,012, are increased
12 per cent, which makes the valua
tion $41,453.44.
When the farmer go to pay their
taxes next year they will find they are
quite a bit higher due to the increase
lican executive council. The increase
wiil all.be on the live stock, as no
change will be made in the assess
ment of real estate this year.

will tell you that the state levy for
taxes has not been increased. That
is true, but what is the difference.
They leave the state levy the same

ations of all live stock, which will
increase the state taxes many thous

es will also be materially increased,
for the levies have been made on the

W. C. Stempel to Leave Leon.
It is with sincere regret that
Ave
announce that Leon is to lose two of
her best citizens, Mr. and Mrs. W. C.
Stempel, Mr. Stempel having last
week purchased a drug store at Ft.
Madison, Iowa. Mr. and Mrs. Stem
pel have been residents of Leon for
a number of years, and during all of
this time, until a little over a year
ago he has been engaged in the drug
business in Leon. He is also one of
the owners of the Cholene Co., and
since disposing of his drug interests
in this city and at Decatur, has de
voted his time to the Cholene busi
ness. He has always taken an active
part in the business affairs of Leon
and he will be missed.
The following notice of his pur
chasing a store at Mt. Madison is tak
en from the Ft. Madison Daily Gem
City of last Thursday:
The Vandolah Drug Co. establish
ment, located at 2621 Santa Fe Ave.,
and which has been conducted for the
past four months by Dr. Vandolah,
passed into the ownership of W. C.
Stempel, through a transaction com
peted today.
Mr. Stempel, who is a well known
former resident of Ft. Madison, be
ing a son of Dr. H. F. Stempel, will
take charge of the business immed
iately. Mr. Stempel is a business
man of long experience and has been
a druggist for many years. He was in
the drug business at L.eon, Iowa, for
a period of 16 years. He Served his
apprenticeship with his, father, who
lor many years conducted the drug
establishment of H. F. Stempel &
Son in the city.
He passed the state examination
before the state board in the year of
1895. He also served as hospital
steward at the state prison here for a
year and a half. Mr. Stempel will
be a valuable acquisition to the com
mercial circles of the city.
Dr. Vandolah has been very suc
cessful since he opened the drug
store in the west end. He is forced to
go west for his health, however, and
lias disposed of his business with
that end in view. He will remain in
Ft. .Madison for a month or two and
will then take up his residence on a
farm out west.

Another shooting affray took place
]at Pleasanton Monday. It seems a
warrant had been issued for a young
man clerking in Dr. Crofford's for
selling liquor contrary to the laws of
Missouri. When the officer went to
serve the warrant the fellow eluded
him and escaped. Branscombe Mc
Grew is a young man who has been

Was being discussed by some parties
when McGrew volunteered to arrest
the man if the warrant was turned
over to him. This was done and he
went to the drug store to arrest the
clerk. Arriving there he informed
the clerk he had" a warrant and was
going to arrest him. The clerk said
he guessed not, and started out the
door to cross over the line into Iowa.
I McGrew pulled his revolver, Pierce
'style, and commenced firing, but did
!not hit his man. It is claimed he
jsliot at the man twice after he was on

great Roy Norton stories, in which

Farnum part—big Bill Matthews of
the Croix d'Or mine. It is a story of
the struggles of the partners in a big
mine who are harassed by a secret
enemy, who imprisons them in a
mine shaft and blows up the reser

mine depends. The story is one of
real thrills from start to finish. Mati

July Was a Hot One,
The month of July was indeed a
scorcher and broke all records for
many years in Iowa, the mercury
hovering around the 100 mark for
days at a time, but with the first day
of August there was a decided mod
eration with slight showers which
were a great relief. Mr. I. N. McPher
rin brings us a clipping from a Cory
don raper of July 25, 1901, showing
that that year was a hot one, and the
present year is the hottest one since
that time. In 1901 the hot spell
commenced on June 23rd with 90
degrees, and gradually increased to
1)7 on the last day of June. July
came in with 97, 99

Chariton-Leon Short Cut.
The people at Weldon are now
hard at work establishing a short cut
from Chariton to Leon via Weldon.
This trail is now being marked with
white poles, and at cross roads and
intersections large sign boards are
being erected, giving the mileage and
direction. When this highway is
continued into Chariton it will fur
nish one avenue for traffic between
Chariton and the Jefferson Highway.
Every effort should be made by those
interested in the welfare of this city
to have tourists pass through Chari
tton—Chariton Leader.
lli-okc His Arm Cranking Car.
Albert Fleet, of the Decatur Coun
ty Overland Co., met with a serious
accident Monday morning. He was
cranking an Oakland car which kick
ed back and struck him on the right
arm breaking it just above the wrist.
It will be pretty sore for some time
to come. Mr. Fleet is one of the
champion tennis players of the state,
and with his partner, H. E. Gelatt,

Bluffs, and it is feared that the in
jury may put an end to his tennis
playing.
