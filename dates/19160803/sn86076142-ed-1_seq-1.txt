LONDON, August 3. Sir Roger ('iist-iucut, former Hritish knight
and consul, was hanged at. ! o'clock this morning in l'entonville
jail for high treason. The prisoner was convicted of conspiring to
cause an armed revolt in Ireland and for having sought (ierinun aid.
Twenty minutes after Casement HKcended the scaffold the great
prison hell began to toll. The sound was greeted by cheers from
the crowd outside, mingled with groans. One minute ufter !) o'clock
a single stroke of the bell announced that the trap was sprung.
Casement met death with calm courage, according to eye
witnesses. Two priests of the Komaii Catholic church administered
the last riles in his cell and then the little procession, headed by
the clergymen, with Casement following with a warden, on either
side, proceeded toward the execution shed, five yards away. The
priests recited the litany of the dying, Casement rescinding in low
tones, "Lord have mercy on my soul." He mounted the scaffold
steps firmly and commended his spirit to Ood as he stepped on
the trap. A moment later the lever was pulled.
Casement was pronounced dead nine minutes later.
An affecting incident occurred outside the prison during the
execution. Hack Irom the prison a little distance Iron) the jeering
wuwd was a group of thirty Irish men and women. When the bell
announced the drop the persona in the group fell on their knees
with bared heads, silently praying for some momenta for the repose
of the soul of their fellow countryman.
('memo nt showed not t in; slightest emu-em over his fate. He
ate well and chatted freely. He was notified that be would be
laWed to wear his own civilian clothes without a shirt collar.
All hopes of an eleventh hour reprieve were dashed by the
statement of Lord Robert Cecil, under secretary of foreign affairs,
that no government doing its duty could interfere with the sentence.

I n Associated Press.)
POIITLAND, Ore., August 3. The
Supreme lodge, Knights of Pythias,
which Is meeting here In twenty-.
ninth biennial convention, and the
Supreme temple, Pythian Sisters,
were to be almost In constant session
throughout the day. The principal
business before the Supreme lodge
was the election of officers.
Since the first of the week a move
ment has been under way to bring
about the election of a western man
as supreme vice chancellor. This is
(univalent to electing a supreme
chancellor, as the invariable rule of
(he body is to advance the vice
chancellor at the next election.
In the half century of the history
of the fraternity, the west has never
had a supreme chancellor. Among
the western candidates whose names
have been put forward are Robert F.
Burns, of California, and Charles F.
Davis, of Colorado. William Ladue,
of New York, and W. F. Breenlng. of
Maryland, are among the eastern men
who have been prominently men
tioned for the vice chancellorship.

Discussing some recent problems,
Mr. Scott said:
A great deal is being said now
about the hyphenated American. It
would be well to put a soft pedal
upon talk of that kind. Let it be
