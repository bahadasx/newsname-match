Casement showed not the slightest
concern over his fate. He was cheerful
to the last.

crowd of men, women and children

At '9 o'clcyrif the crowd extended two

crowd to mcrocand cheer, which sud

Casement met his death with calm
courage. .Early in the morning two
priests administered the rites to the

(An Affecting Incident.
xSI A IT affecting incident took place out
side the prison wall as the execution
way in progress. At the back of the
prison, a little distance from the jeer
ipg crowd, was a group of about thir
ty Irishmen and women. When the
4' dull clang of the prison bell announced
that the dffomed man had paid the
,penalty this little group fell on their
:-knees and with bowed heads prayed
fur the repose of the soul of their dead
countryman.
All the mqm$ers of Casement's fam
ily were protestants but he was con­
verted to- Roman Catholicism within
the last few weeks. He received his
first and pnly communion at 7 o'clock
this morning when he assisted at
5. mass In his cell. One of the attend
ants said his overpowering love for
God and Ireland was most striking.
"I Die For My Country."

Words of the condemned man, apart'

Father McCarrell said that he found

Honors Takeii Away.
Honored with knighthood—a title
since taken away from him by King
George's order—for his many years of
servlce-for Great Britain as consul ^nd
consul-general, Roger Casement as
sumed leadership, at a period of his
/country's crisis, in the recent Irish re
bellion, the plans for which were laid
while Casement was in Berlin, where
he was reported to have negotiated an
understanding with the German im
perial authorities.
British naval supremacy brought an
abortive close to Casement's plans.
The German tramp- steamship on
which there was transported an armed
expedition from Germany nearly to the
west coast of Ireland in April of this
year was blown up by Its own crew
when the latter foresaw that it was
Inevltaible that the blockading English
warships would capture It. The crew
were made prisoners. The tramp had
been convoyed from Kiel by a German
submarine, from which Casement and
a companion landed on Irish soil,
where they were taken into custody
before their plans matured.
In May, Casement was given a pre
liminary hearing and was committed
for trial on the charge of high treason.
l*ate in June the trial was begun.
Casement pleading not guilty and ut
tering a denial that he had worked in
Germany's Interests and that he had
accepted German gold as a bribe.
The court's verdict was guilty, and
the sentence of death by hanging was,
after appeal by his counsel, confirmed
•by the court of criminal appeal, late in
July.
Had Sympathy of U. S.
The London press generally ap
proved the fate legally fixed for Case
ment, but In America persistent efforts
were made to save the noted prisoner
from death. In Washington, a resolu
tion was adopted in the senate which
would have President Wilson intercede
with the British government, and num
erous petitions went to the White
House from many sources asking that
a plea for clemency be cabled. The
senate resolution was not adopted.
President Wilson took no official ac
tion. In England, the Manchester
Guardian and a number ol other pa
pers pleaded for mercy and petitions
asking for a reprieve were circulated
in London. Adherents of John Red
mond forwarded to Premier Asquith a
petition signed by six bishops, twen
ty-six members of parliament and flf
|y-one other persons, including a num
ber of educators.

Casement, in a statement given out
today in reply to that made' by Lord
Roger Cecil in London yesterday says
that the statement that "Irish prison

SIR ROGER CASEMENT HANGED AS TRAITOR
Six .Zeppelins Drop
Eighty Bombs on
Coast' of England
London, Aug. 3.—Six German air
ships took part in the raid on the east
ern counties of England this morning,
according to an official announcement,
which says eighty bombs were reported
to have been dropped. Nine horses were
killed and three injured, the statement
adds.
The statement follows:
"Several hostile airships attacked the
eastern and southeastern counties last
night. The first reports were received
about midnight. From these it seems
that not less than six airships were at
tacking the counties of Norfolk, Suf
folk and-Essex, more or less simultan
eously. The raid lasted about an hour
and a half.
"Except at one point the raiders did
not penetrate very fr inland, but con
tented themselves with dropping a few
bombs at a time on widely distant lo
calities, mainly near the sea.
"Anti-aircraft guns came into ac
tion. in one locality but the raider
made good his retreat.
"In conjunction wtih this attack one
airship was making for the coast of
Kent. Many observors report that a
second airship: followed the first. The
number of bombs, in this attack makes
the statement appear quite possible.
Anti-air craft guns came Into action
and one If not two hits are claimed.
"A total number of eighty bombs
have been accounted for up to dat^, in
clusive of those seen falling Into the
»sea. The total damage was astonish
ingly small. The military object of the
raid is not apparent."

Endorsement of Hughes For Presi

Urged by Various Factions Cffort to
Endorse Wilson Doomed to Oefeat,
Indianapolis, Aug. 8.—Represents
tives of the progressiva party from a
score of states met here today to for
mally protest against ths action of
the bull mooso national oommlttee In
endorsing the nomination of Charles
Hughes, and to consider tho advi
sability of calling another convention
to fill the vacancy on tho national
ticket.
The oonferenoo was called by
John M. Parker, of Louisiana, nomine*
for vice president
The representatives of one element
of the party, led by Judge Albert 1.
Norton, of fit. Louis, were outapoken
for the assembling of tha progressive
national convention at an early data
to nominate a candidate for president
to run with John ML Parker, nominee
for vice president. Another faotlon
regarded this plan as Impracticable
and was prepared to urge iasuanoe ef
a call for a new convention to oom
plete the national tioket. Influential
Bull Moose leaders from several state*
exprossed themselves as opposed to
both thesa plans on tha ground that
they had no available candidate tor
president and that thera waa Inavf
flolent time In which t» orcanla*
a national campaign.
Slama National
All present, however, «n WMWU
moue that the national committer had 8*
exceeded Its powers and violated Iks
party's principles In endorsing tha
candidate of another political organi
zation for president,
It is expected that bafbre tha con
ference adjourns resolutions will be
adopted criticising the national com
mittee.
If an attempt should be made to
have the conference endorse tha oan
dldacy of "Wilson for re-election, thera
Is every indication that It will ba
voted down, as the members declare
such a course will be inconsistent
after the protest made against tha
support accorded Hughes by a major
ity of the national committee.
The only names mentioned early in
the day for the head of the ticket
were Victor Murdock, of Kansas, who
already has declined the honor, and
who is said now to be on the way to
China, and Bainbrldge Colby, of New
York.
Lack of other candidates appears
to be one of the most potent argu
ments nf minority against call
ing another convention.
Among those present were H. H.
Griffiths, of Des Moines, Iowa John
M. Parker of Louisiana, and Bain
bridge Colby of New York.
NO BANDITS IN SIGHT.

Flnlay last night states he had the
locality where ISO Mexicans were re
ported to have been seen thoroughly

lieve that report of presence of Mexi
can bandits is a mistake.
