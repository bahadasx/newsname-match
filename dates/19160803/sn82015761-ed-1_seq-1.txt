BED LAKE BARBECUE
17
At a meeting held in Williams
last Saturday of the committees
-announced in the last issue , of' the
News, several of the Red Lake
citizens thought it would be best to
have all committees appointed
from their district as they had last
yesr given a successful barbecue.
The members out side the district
were pleased with the suggestion
and ; resigned f with , the assurance
that they would help' in any way
possible to make the barbecue a
success. They said that they were
much pleased to see the spirit
of Red Lake in desiring to run
their own barbecue.
Enthusiastic Meeting at Red
Lake School House
Last Sunday afternoon the citi
zens of Red Lake held the most
successful meeting ever held in the
Valley. The attendance was sur
prisingly large and harmony pre
vailed throughout.
H. D. Boulin was choosen chair
man of the meeting and L. W.
Cureton secretary. The question
came up whether or not T. H.
Cureton should be included with
Red Lake. It was decided from
the fact that he is the teacher of
the district that he be included
It was also stated that Mr. Cureton
spends most of the larger part of
each year in the district and shows
the same interest in the Valley as
others living there.
Upon proper motion the follow
ing committees wer elected.'
Executive: Carl H. Hinds, C C.
Thomasson, Thos. Moss.
Finance: H. D. Boulin, Ed Roupe,
L. W. Cureton.
Grounds: C. C. Carpenter, Orville
.Hardy, C. B. Hume. ..
Program: T. H. Cureton, A. W,
Cook, Elton Hardy.
Supplies: Elton Hardy, E. T.
Hinds, W. F. Thomasson, Geo.
Daggs, Mr. Calhoun.

C. C. Carpenter, Mrs. H. D.
Boulin, Mrs. W. F. Thomas

C, C. Thomasson, Mrs. Ed
Roupe, Mrs. E. R. Kincannon,
Mrs. C. B Hume. Mrs. Moss,
Mrs. L. W. Cureton, E. R. Kin
cannon, King Baker.
It was decided to auction the
Cold Drinks Stand privilege to the
highest bidder. After a lively
bidding scene ot several minutes
Ed Roupe won the prize with hie
final bid of S30.00.
Next the bidding on the Danc
ing Platform came up which, on
account ot costs ot material, was
not so lively, H. D. Boulin won at
86.50.
The money received from these
concessions will be defraying the
expenses of the barbecue, and we
hope that all who attend will in
vest liberally in a way that will
help these men make a financial
winning for their labor and money
expended.
ine rveo iaice people are in no
wise selfish and greedy. They are
. poor people yet willing to dig up
hve dollars each and put in
week s time for the pleasures of
others, without expecting a cent in
return.-" MoBtrbarbecues are given
- for ths-purpose of helping someone
make money. Not so with Red
Lake.
Everybody is invited and urged
to attend and eniov the speaking,
horse racing, broncho busting; foot
racing and many other contests
and amusements. Governor Hunt
Hon. Tom Campbell and othe
prominent men have promised to
attend and speak. All the county
CTCandidates of all parties will be

the day will be published later.

friends, Mrs. Bozena Allen, (Mrs.
O. Allen), has consented to
make the race for the nomination

which is undoubtedly one of the
best organizations of the kind in
the state. She" h&s:'demqristratd
her natural "executive" ability in
numerous successful under-takings
and has the happy faculty of bring
ing her jovial, whole-souled, sunny
nature to bear on many of the cold,
frosty problems that have confront
ed her, with the lesult there was a
general thawing and a pleasant
way out for all concerned. A
happy faculty is very , necessary in
public life.
While Mrs. Allen is naturally
fond of home life, the Insistent re
quest of friends and the exigencies
of the occasion, prevailed and she
consented to make the race for the
office. As in all her undertakings,
having agreed to become a candi
date, will make every effort toward
bringing about a successful con
clusion to her first effort in the po
litical world, with a personal prac-
t cal need behind the effort.
She has been a resident of Flag
staff for the past seven years and
during that time has demonstrated
her ability as a high class musician,
both vocal and instrumental, and
has given freely "of her talents to
all charitable or other entertain
ments which needed her ability to
forward the movement.
Mrs. Allen is thoroughly com
petent to fill the office and will
give a most creditable account of
herself if the people see fit to elect
her to the place. ..

Funeral Impressive
And

afternoon at the home of Pete

bination of the ritual of the Bro
therhood of Locomotive Firemen
and Engineers and that of the
methodist Church, Rev. Hoffpauir
officating for the church.

visable to hold an inquest on the

death. Arrangements had been
made for the services to begin at
2 o'cljck but on account of the in'
quest they were not begun until
3 .30 o'clock.

friends were present on the sad oc
casion, about half of whom joined
the processian to the cemetery.
The last rites were finished ai
about 5 o'clock.

from Milwaukee several years ago
for his life's health. His home
was in Grand Canyon. He was a
very likable man and had made
many friends in Arizona who join
tnose nearer related to mm in
mourning his untimely death.
The question of strong drinks
came up and the Red Lake people
feel from the fact that this is purely
a good time donated by the Valley
and its friends, that the boys who
sometimes carry a bottle will leave
them at home on that day. The
cold drinks stand will furnish
plenty of refreshments.

CLOUD-BURST CAUSES
CANYON JAD WRECK
Fireman Fred Terry Loses
His Life 4000 feet of
track washed out.
As the evening train on the Can
yon road was making the run from
Grand Canyon to Williams last
Saturday night it ran into a flood!
between Anita and Willaha which-.
had been ea used by a cloud-burst. -The
speed' of the train was slacken
ed and engineer W. E. Oswald felt
ins way aiong, dui on reaching
and entering upon a bridge over
Red Horse Wash the engine went
down taking engineer Oswald witb
it and fastening fireman Fred
Terry between engine and tender.
Engineer Oswald escaped from the .
wreck without serious injury but
before fireman Terry could be re
leased he was enveloped in steam
from a bursting pipe and scalded to
death.
The; cloud-burst filled the can
yor thru which the railroad runs
along this stretch to a depth of
more than 15 feet and with a
width of 200 feet to a half mile.
The force of the current down the
canyon washed out about . 4000
feet of track and three bridges.
The cloud-burst was accompanied
by hail in large quantities. The
subsiding flood left hail hanks
several feet deep.
The passengers on the wrecked
train were taken back to Grand
Canyon where they remained until
Monday p. m( when arrangements
bad been made to transfer them -around
the gap in the track and
bring them into Williams. Re
pairs on the track were - begun at
once and will be . completed by
Saturday when service will be re
sumed.
EVIDENCE OF LONGEVITY
To The Williams News
Mr. Editor:
Sitting in a row of 7 seats
at the Sultana Theater Sunday
night were 7 bachelors. In this
statement alone there is nothing
so remarkable but I would add v
that they were old timers of Wil
liam?, having lived here during all
the exiting times of, those former
evil and historical days. This of
itself has no. great significance,
either, but the most wonderful
part is this: that the combined
time that these 7 gentlemen sitting
in a row at the picture show, had
lived in Williams aggregated more
than 150 years, and the combined
ages of the 7 gentlemen was more
than 400 years.
Williams is noted fo r the long
evity of its people.
