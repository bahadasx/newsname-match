"I Die for My Country," Are
Last Words of Irishman
Executed for Treason.
BIG CROWD WAITS OUTSIDE
Cheers and Groans Intermingled
as Bell Announces Passing
of Rebel.
LONDON, Aug. 3. Roger Case
ment paid the penalty for treason
today with his life. He was
hanged at 0:07 a. m. today, at
Pentonville prison, to which he
had been removed from the Tow
er of London.
Ten minutes later his body was
cut .down, life being pronounced
extinct.
The Irish leader's last words,
spoken while he waited fearlessly
for the drop to be sprung, were:
"I die for my country."
The Rochdale barber, Ellis, the
prisons regular executioner,
sprung the drop after he had ad
justed the hempen noose not the
'silken cord" which the former
knight had hoped up to a few
weeks ago would be granted as
his instrument of death, in ac
cordance with the ancient priv
ilege granted men of his title.
CROWD OUTSIDE.
The hanging wu witnessed' only by of
ficials of the prison A Urge crowd
waited outside the grim goal, and -when
the bell tolled announcing the law's sat
isfaction, there were a few cheers in
termixed with groans.
Several Irish women standing at the
rear of the Pentonville Jail, attempted
a demonstration, led by an Irish member
of Parliament, but were quickly hustled
off the scene by guards.
A coroner's Inquest over the body of
Casement, hel dat 1:90 resulted In the
solemn verdict that his death was "due
to execution by hanging."
Ii -was said Casement went calmly to
his death, led by a Catholic priest, who
ministered to him when he retired last
night for the last time, at 10:30, and
when he arose early today. The Irish
leader has only recently been converted
to Cathollclcsm.
Two Catholic priests. Fathers Ring and
Carey, heard Casement's last confes
sion and administered holy communion
to the condemned man.
Both accompanied him to the scaffold.

INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. Aug. 3,-The
three-way split that divides the re
maining Progressive party leaders was
emphasised today with the arrival of
representative Bull Moose from many
States for the national conference which
opened at 11 a. m. In the Claypool
Hotel.
Three programs represented by the
delegates were:
To let the national ticket go by de
fault, and not hold another national
convention this year, but to call a
party conrerence to no neia nouu unci
the election and start an nggrcsslvo
four-year fight for 1W0.
To indorso the candidacy of President
Wilson.
To order a national convention and
boxln the best light possible against
both old parties.
These three possibilities appeared to
have strength In the order given, with
the conutrolllng element against a na
tional ticket, and against an Indorse
ment of Wilson.
"There are only two possibilities for
this conference to decide: Bhalt we have
a national ticket or shall we not?" said
John M. Parker, the convention nomi
nee for Vice President, today. "There is
no possibility that we shall Indorso Wil
son or Hughes."

NORFOLK, Aug. 3. Foreign

NEW YORK, Aug. 3. Tie-up
of the 1,291 cars that operate on
the 450 miles of surface tracks on
the New York city railways within
twenty-four hours seemed certain
shortly before noon today, when
the conference called by Mayor
Mitchel between union and com
pany representatives failed to reach
an agreement. Eight thousand
men are affected.
Such an addition to the lines on
which strikes already have been
declared would bring the total
mileage directly affected up to
1,010, the number of cars up to
2,148, and the number of men to
15,600.
RECOGNITION IS SNAG.
Recognition of the Amalgamated As
sociation of Street and Electrlo Rail
way Employes was the point on which
the conference struck a snag.
Union leaders Insist on such recog
nition. President Theodore Shonts, of the
New York City railways, refused even
to admit the men are dissatisfied. He
Insisted he had received no demands
"from his employes," and declared be
could not recognise "demands of
aliens."
Shonts turned down urgent sugges
tions by Mitchel that no men be dis
charged for Joining the union until
another conference had been held. He
dented that any men have been dis
charged for this reason, saying It was
Impossible since the company recou
nted no union led by outsiders.

MANY MISUNDERSTAND VOTE
Ballot Is Not Being Taken on
Strike, But to Authorize
Officials to Deal.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
President Wilson is not disposed
to interfere in any vay with the
instrumentalities now provided by
law for settling the differences be
tween the railroads of the country
and their employes.
After conference with Judge
Chambers, of the United States
Board of Mediation and Concilia
tion, today, the White House per
mitted it to be known tat there is
no present prospect of any effort
to force action by other than the
processes which the mediation and
arbitration law provides.
The situation is not regarded by
those best informed as so menac
ing as has been widely understood
The members of the organizations
of engineers, firemen, conductors,
and trainmen have taken a bal
lot, but they have not voted to
strike.
AUTHORIZE "DEALINGS."
Rather, an affirmative vote merri?
means that the unions will give their
chief executives power to enter Into
"dealings" for adjustment of differences.
"Dealing" may be directly with the rail
road managers, or with the mediation
and concollatlon board.
The result of the ballot Is unquestion
ably In favor of granting this authority
and the authority Includes power to call
a strike In neither mediation nor arbi
tration shall bring about a settlement.
But the country, as waa explained to
President Wilson today, la a long way
from a railroad tie-up. The present
mediation and concollatlon law was
passed three years ago ; and In almost
every instance has been efficacious in
producing settlement without strike.
President Wilson waa assured that
there is no reason, as yet, for grave
doubt that a settlement can be achieved
In the present trouble.
on August b tne presidents or tne
four labor organizations will meet In
New York n conference with the con
ference committee of managers of
the railroads of the country. This
will really be a general conference
between the leading railroad execu
tives and their organised employes.
First Time in History.
The present Is the only labor crisis
In which all four of these organisa
tions have been arrayed on one side.
It Is also the first In which they have
trrled their demands to the entire
railroad system of the country.
Under the law If this conference of
August 8 does not bring agreement,
either side may Invote the services
of the board of mediation and concil
iation. It Is practically certain Pres
ident Wilson was assured that one
side or the other will make this re
quest. It Is also very certain, he was

The legislative committee of the

at the District National Bank to dlscass

this amendment came aa a surprise) to
Washlngtonlans.
The amendment, offered by Senator
Sterling, of South Dakota, would affect
every bank depositor and every owner
of bonds and shares of stock within the
District of Columbia. Aa approved by
the Senate, by a vote ot 61 to IS. the
amendment reads:

of the District of Columbia for the fis
cal vear endlnr June 90.

adding after paragraph i of said see-
tion:
That the monevs and credits. Includ
ing moneys loaned and Invested, bonds
and shares of stock (except the stock
of banks and other corporations within
the District of Columbia the taxation ot
which banks and corporation Is herein
provided for) of any person, firm, as

at their fair cash value, and aa taxes

District tour-tenths of X per cant ot h
value thereof."
On Behalf of Depositor.
The interest of the bankers In tha pro
posed legislation Is largely In behalf af
their depositors. It was pointed out
today that the capital and surplus ot
banks are already taxed, and the ad
ditional levy, therefore, would not tall
upon the banks themselves, but upon
those with whom, they do business.
For Instance, If a depositor has UW
upon which he draws V per cent interest
per year, that Interest Is reduced by the
special tax Imposed on the principal.
At 4 per cent this tax would amount to
40 cents, and the interest on tne de
positors' money In reality will amount
to only It'.bO per year.
Or, aa Illustrated by Colin H. Living
stone, vice president or the American
iNationai Hank, the owner of a S1.UUU
bonds which pays 4 per cent, will re
ceive an Income of W per year. Wut
this Income must be reduced by the ad
ditional levy on the principal sum,
amounting to M per year, so the U.am
bond would pay only (Mi Instead of tha
4 per cent contemplated when tha pur
chase was made.
Sent Oat Hurry CalL
Chairman H. H. McKee, ot the
legislative committee of the Bankers'
Association, sent out a hurry call this
morning for a meeting of the committee
this afternoon. The bankers realise,
however, that the amendment enjoys a
parliamentary status that will make It
difficult to defeat. Inclusion ot the
amendment In the District bill by the
Senate puts Its acceptance up to tho
members who may be named by the
