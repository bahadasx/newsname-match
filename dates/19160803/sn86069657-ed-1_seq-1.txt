Attention, Democrats! 5
r
An inspection of the Congressional Record shows that Mr.
Cantrill deserted the President and the Democratic majority of
Congress upon several of the "most vital mattenHKiichHare been
before Congress in recent years. Congressman Cantrill claims to
have "Loyally Supported the President."
When the great Banking and Currency act was passed; the
act which established Federal Reserve Banks and did more to
place the financinl system of this country upon a firm, substan
tial and permanent basis than all other currency legislation with
in half a century, the record shows that Cantrill did not Vote.
When the resolution was up for passage justifying the Presi
dent in the employment of armed forces to enforce the demands
made upon Victoriano Hucrta for unequivocable amends to the
United States for the affronts and indignities committed against
this Government by General Huerta, Cantrill did not Vote.
When the Emergency Currency Act was up for passage in the
House, which was- the bill for re-enacting tholaw popularly
known as the Aldrich-Vreeland bill, the record shows that Can
trill did not Vote.
When the bill was up for passage to regulate the sale of con
vict labor goods, a bill which was advocated by organized labor
and by various Prison Reform Associations, the record shows that
Cantrill did not Vote.
When the currcrcy bill was up for passage in the House, the
record shows that Cantrill did not vote.
The record shows that Cantrill voted against the bill
granting a pension of $30 per month to veterans of the Mexican
War who were disabled from work.
The record shows that not only did Cantrill vote against
the National Prohibition Bill, but he made a speech in
Congress against the bill and franked it all over the country.
Is this why the liquor people to a man are for him?
When the appropriation Bill was before the House to pay tho
actual traveling expenses of members of Congress in going to and
returning once from each session of Congress instead of the old
graft rate of twenty cents per mile, Mr. Cantrill voted against
it. This net is now saving one hundred and seventy thou
sand dollars yearly to the people.
And again, an inspection of the record shows that there were
sixty-seven record votes taken during the third session of the
sixty-third Congress and Mr. Cantrill is recorded as not voting
thirty times out of the sixty-seven.
Is it becauso of his record that ho refuses to meet his oppon
ent on the stump before tho people, but uses their money in
franking form letters to the Democratic voters instead of being
honest enough to pay his own campaign expenses? '
Think this over, Mr. Democratic Voter, before the primary elec
tion Saturday. Do you believe in continuing in ofilco n man who
so "Loyally Supports tho President" in such fashion?
Vote for R. E. L. Murphy Aug. 5. He will repre
sent the People and support Woodrow Wilson.
