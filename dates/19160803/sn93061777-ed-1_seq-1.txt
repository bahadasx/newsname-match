Who the
PROMOTER PAND0LFO PINCHED
APPREHENDED AT CARRIZ0Z0
Sheriff Moye Had Long Journey By Auto and Rail
to Catch Up With Him.
An information was filed be
fore Judge Noble last week by
Officer Sadler, charging S. C,
Pandolfo, the auto faetory pro
moter, with criminal libel. The
action grav out of the meeting
Wednesday night July 19th at
the Elks auditorium, when con
siderable criminations and re
criminations were indulged in
by prominent citiiens of Clovii
and the promoter.
The allegations set forth in the
info, mation are to the effect that
Pandolfo in his reply to criticisms
of his methods, used slanderous
and libellous language regard
ing the Clovis National bank and
its president, Alex Shipley. It
alleged that the remarks made
about the bank and its president
were calculated to weaken their
financial credit and lose them
the confidence of the community
and said language was malic
iously used to damage said
parties.
The warrant was placed in the
hands of Sheriff Moye Wednes
day evening, who at once tele
phoned to officers at Tucumcari
instructing them to arrest Pan
dolfo and hold him until his
arrival. The officers replied that
the man wasted was in town
and that they would have him
in custody ready for delivery
when the sherilf arrived.
Mr. Moye arrived ac Tucum
cari in his auto at 9 a. m. the
next mornidg and interviewed
the local officials and diicovered
that Pandolfo had gone uo man
knows whither. Enquiry from
members of his family failed
to elicit any information as to
his whereabouts. After some
strenuous detective work the
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
IS DEING EXPLOITED
Clovis Will Probably Locate An Institution Which
Has Long Been Badly Needed.
The merchant! and physicians
and other energetic and public
spirited citizens of Clovis and
vicinity are actively engaged in
endeavoring to secure subscrip

of erecting a community hospital
in this city.
It is estimated that it will re
quire $10,000 to insure the build
ing and equipment of the much
needed institution, but this early
in the campaign sufficient money
has been subscribed toeaceurage
those active in the movement to
believe it will be only a matUr
of a few weeks until the entire
amoun necessary will be pledged
and the location of the hospital
insured.
No more csramendable a pro
ject has ever been put before
the people of Curry and attain
ing counties than this effort to
establish an Institution far the

surgical attention of those afflict

wounds and other cases, which

officer discovered a clue that
Pandolfo and his son had gone
towards Santa Fe and he took
his trail and found, upon arriv
ing at Santa Rosa, that he was
about three hours behind his
quarry. At Santa Rosa, Mr.
Moye left his ears and took the
train to Vaughn and when he
arrired there he learned that he
was on the right trail and re
embarked for Carroeozo. Ar
riving at Carrizozo, the officer
waited about six heurs when the
big twelve cylinder Pakard hove

moter and his son. The warrant
was served on him and he was
informed that a $500 bond would
be necessary to secure him his
liberty. The bond was readily
furnished. Harry B. Dawson,
cashier of a Carrozozo bank and
Mrs. Julia Gurney a wealthy
lady of that city becoming his
sureties.
The pursuit began Thursday
and ended Saturday, the officer
being continuously on Pandolfo'
trail. Sheriff Mo.vc states that
it was difficult to follow the
route that the promoter took as
he did not register at the hotels
on his way but sought the ac
eomodations of ranch houses
perhaps to give the occupants an
opportunity to invest in Pan

Sheriff that he was on his way
to El Paso to fill a business en

PAVING MAIN STREET
IS BEING AGITATED
Many Merchants and Property Owners on Principal
Thoroughfare Are In Favor of It.
There has been considerable
discussion indulged in recently,
regarding the feasibility of pav
ing Main Street from the Santa
Fe to the Court house and many
property owners whose holdings
face that thoroughfare have ex
pressed themselves as being in
favor of the proposition.
To say nothing of the added
attractiveness and convenience
this improvement would be to
the city, the economic value of
it is self evident to the thinking
business man.
During the summer season the
merchants suffer inculcable
damage from the dust that
settles on their merchandise and
in rainy weather the conditions
are as had. With Main street
paved and the side streets oiled
at small expense, this nuisance
would be (.bated and the eity
rendered more healthful and at
tractive. In order to provide for paving
street intersections it would he
necessary probably to vote a
bond issue for this purpose, but
if the ptoperty owners are will
ing to be assessed for the con
struction of the pavement in
front of their lots, we are confi
dent that the progressive tax
payers of the city would vote to
pay the other expense.
It is true that Clovis at this
early stage of its existence can
not afford to indulge in the ex
tensive municipal improvements
that many towns of its size have
carried on, but it would appear
that the Main street paving
ASSESSED VALUATION OF CURRY
COUNTY MAKES BIG STRIDES
Nearly as Great as Santa Fe, Oldest County, and
Twice as Much as Taos.
Curry county, although one of
the youngest counties of the
state, shows an assessed valua
tion nearly as great as Santa Fe,
the oldest county, and twice as
much as Taos county. The tax
commission at Santa Fe has re
ceived the tax roll of Curry
county which gave the assessed
valuation as $9,107,700.
The following is the assess
ment by classification; City and
town property, value $3,283,747;
agricultural improvements, value
$292 G90; horses, mules and
asses, number 5,994, value,
$324,937; sheep and goats, num
ber 1.346, value $5,460; cattle,
number 22.977, value $854.5M;
swine, number 1,940, value $20,
605; household furniture, $87,-
235; autos, number 112, value
$45,200; tools and equipment
$3,550; money $4,500; stocks and
shares $126,055.
The tax roll of Curry County
this year shows an increase of
$1043,300 over the original valu
ation in 1915. and $246,000
greater than the revised valua
tion. This is a fine showing for
Curry County, It is the best
possible proof that the City and
County is growing in a very
substantial manner.
preposition is one that should be
encourrged as a badly needed
improvement.
With the pavement construct
ed and the lateral avenues oiled,
living is Clovit would be mora
pleasant and desirable and
would attract many more home
seekers. With oil selling at the
present price and the prospect
that it will go lower, the ave
nues could be treated at small
cost and with a street sweeper
to clean the pavement, dust and
mud would disappear from the
city.
Many towns no older and not
as well-to-do financially as Clovia
have paved their princidai
streets long ago and would not
have the work undone for many
times their cost, as it has proven
to be the best investment they
could have made both for the
property owaors and the munici
pality. For example Altus Okla., a
town which oannet boast of a
larger popalation than Clovia
has four paved streets which
adds to the beauty of the town;
Coalgate Okla., about the size
of this city and having very
few wealthy citizens have four
streets and avenues paved with
brick and asphalt; Hoopeston
111., with a little over 4000 popu
lation has 30 miles of paving not
only the business sections being
improved, but also many of the
residence streets. These ex-
staples could bt multiplied and
that which these towns have
done, Clovis can do.
Parmer County's
Court Housa
The Commissioners of Parmer
county met Monday and voted to
build a conrt house in Farwell
costing not less than $50,009.00
We understand that the Capitol
Com paay has kindly deeded the
west half of the plaza to the
coaaty on which to put the build
ing, and the east half to a board
of trustees for the benefit of
the city, which will probably be
used for farm demonstration
purposes until such time as the
city may be able to care for it as
a city park preposition. The
plaza embraces about thirteen
acres of land, which will give ua
about six and a half acres for a
court house lawa and the same
amouat for a city park.
The architects are working on
the plans and specifications for
the building, and it is thought
that actual caastruction will be
gin not later than the first of
October. Farwell Tribune.
