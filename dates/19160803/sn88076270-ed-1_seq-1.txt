CQHSTRUCTIQII CREW
WORK GOING FORWARD AT
BRIDGE SITE—EXPECT COM
PLETION BY SEPTEMBER 1
The actual work of building the
twenty-six boats to be used in the
pontoon bridge to be constructed by
the Missouri River Bridge Company
is now going forward at a rapid pace.
A crew of twelve men is employed at
the lower end of the revetment work
which is the point at which the bridge
will span the channel. The end of
last week found five boats in different
stages of completion.
President Calderwood of the com
pany states that the work is likely
to be delayed by the nonarrival of
some of the larger timbers which
were among the first material order
ed, but which have been lost in transit.
Excavating has been done for the
foundations of the towers that will
support the heavy overhead cable that
will be the chief means of anchoring
the bridge in place.
Anyone who cares to take the half
mile trip will find it interesting to
observe the successive stages of the
work. It is evident that strength and
thoroughness of construction are be
ing made chief considerations in the
plans of this important work. The
company will profit by the misfor
tunes of the upstream bridges that
were recently built.
The main channel will be spanned
by a roadway floated by twenty-six
pontoons. The island and the south
channel can be made passable by
earth grades during the fall season.
Unless serious delays from lack of
material occur the company expects
that the bridge will be in readiness
for use by Sept. 1.
The officers of the company invite
all those interested to visit the scene
of the work and .observe the manner
of construction.
Can of "Sweet" Cream
Explodes—Injures Man
Mandan, N. D., Aug. 2.—Harold
Gilbert was the victim of a very
painful accident when a can of cream
exploded, the cover striking the young
man in the face and breaking his
nose. His face was also badly lacer
ated by the cover and several stitches
were taken to close a gash on his
nose.
The cream had been hauled in flom
Bixby and had been on the road for
two days and was in all probability a
week old before it started. The ex
treme heat and fermentation formed
a large amount of gas in the can and
when the young man tried to pull the
cover off, it exploded with the above
results.
Gilbert has had several narrow
escapes from serious iniury in the
past few weeks, the closest being, a
short time ago, when he was pulled
from beneath a train just in time to
save his life.
OLD-TIME BUFFALO HUNTER OF
PRAIRIES DIES IN MISSOURI
Dickinson, N. D., Aug. 2.—JacK
Hanley, old time pioneer and buffalo
hunter of Medora, and well known by
the older Dickinson residents, died in
the soldiers' home at Higginsville,
Missouri. He was 75 years of age at
the time of his death, and had been
in fairly good health until taken with
diabetes.
Deceased sold his ranch at Medora
in 1905, to G. O. German, a nephew,
and moved back to his bovhood home
at Monticello, Missouri. He later en
tered the soldiers' home at Higgins
ville, where he died.
AGENT GREER TO FARGO
N. L. Greer, who only two months
ago came to Williston from Rugby,
as agent for the Great Northern, has
been promoted to the Company's
largest North Dakota station, which
is Fargo.
During his short incumbency at
Williston, Mr. Greer has made many
friends and has impressed them with
his efficiency as a railroad man. He
left Ane. 1 to assume his new duties.
Fred Thompson, who has been the
G. N.'s agent at Leeds comes to Wil
liston to "take Mr. Greer's place.
ENTERTAINED INFORMALLY
Mrs. M. A. Hegge entertained in
formally on Friday afternoon, July 28,
in compliment to Mrs. C. L. Marshall.
The time was pleasantly spent in
conversation and guessing contests.
Just before the dainty lunch was
served, each guest was given a brush
and requested to decorate a paper
plate with some floral design in wa
ter color. This contest caus6d much
merriment.

ST. PAUL
VISIT
JOBBERS VISIT COUNTRY CUS
TOMERS TO GET ACQUAINTED
AND EXTEND TRADE
En route through North Dakota
and Montana, over the N. P. and G.
N. systems on a tour for trade ex
tension, 100 members of the St. Paul
Association of Commerce visited Wil
liston between 8:00 and 9:00 ^Saturday
morning, July 29.
The special train on which the St.
Paul men traveled arrived from a
side trip on the Plentywood line late
Friday night and was parked in the
Great Northern yards. At 8:00 A. M.
the party, headed by the Minnesota
State Band, came up town as far as
the band stand on Broadway, where
an enjoyable concert was given. Be
tween the numbers the tourists and
local business men became acquainted
and conversed informally. The visitors
were unusually complimentary on the
evidences they observed of progress
and prosperity in the City of Oppor
tunity.
Through the co-operation of a large
number of Williston ladies, flowers
from Williston's numerous flower gar
dens were provided for the dining and
observation cars of the special train.
Frojn the Williston sub-station
farm and the ample garden of Geo.
F. Carpenter a liberal supply of fresh
vegetables was provided for the din
ing car. A sample of red clover in
bloom, grown on a local farm, and
which overtopped anything before re
ceived, was added to the train's col
lection of farm products samples. The
I visitors left with the Commercial club
the attractive "Trade at Home"
booster cards, now displayed in num
erous store windows.
The visit was one of much pleasure
and benefit, and was of the kind that
make for a better and closer spirit of
understanding and co-operation be
tween the jobbers and local mer
chants.
Republicans of 41st
District For Ticket
The central committees of Wil
liams and McKenzie counties consti
tuting the 41st legislative district in
a meeting held in this city last week
announced by resolutions the attitude
of the party organization as favor
able to the ticket nominated, as rep
resentative of the voice of a majority
ot the voters.
The meeting was presided over by
Usher L. Burdick and was attended
by practically all of the precinct com
mitteemen of the two counties. H.
W. Braatelien of this city was chosen
as the member of the Republican
State Central committee from this
district. The executive committee of
the district Republican organization
was elected, the following being
chosen U. L. Burdick, Simon West
by, J. T. Austin, H. R. Lampman, C.
L. Bakken, J. A. Lee, August Matson,
P. A. Carney, Wililam Werner and
Frank Shatswell. The resolutions
committee consists of George F.
Shafer, C. F. Dupuis and E. R. John
son. The following resolutions fram
ed by the committee were unanimous
ly adopted by the organization:
Whereas, a majority of the electors
of the Republican party in North Da
kota have made their choice of candi
dates for the various state, county
and district offices, and whereas the
candidates so chosen are entitled to
the united support of the Republican
party at the coming general election,
and
Whereas North Dakota is a prog
ressive agricultural state and its peo
ple are in need of, and entitled to,
such legislation as will adequately
meet the needs of the people in gen
eral and the agricultural interests in
particular:
Now therefore be it resolved by the
Republican County Central commit
tees of Williams and McKenzie coun
ties in joint convention assembled,
that the Republican nominees for the
state county and district be endorsed
for election in November and that
legislation adequate to meet the needs
of the agricultural interests of the
state be recommended.
Guards Keep I. W. W.
Gang Off Trains
Valley City, N. D., Aug. 2.—Arm
ed guards were successful in keeping
a band of I. W. W.'s away from a Soo
line freight train in the yards north
of Valley City, when the train pulled
out for northern points.
A hundred and fifty men, fresh
from their experiences in South Da
kota and at Jamestown, this state,
where a "reception committee" of
200 met the travelers, attempted to
board and take possession of the Soo
freight train, just as they had suc
cessfully operated at Oakes, when
they took possession of a train that
runs from that citv to Jamestown.
Armed guards, however, had been
placed aroundl the train, and they
were successful in holding the gang
off, until the train pulled out of the
city. Had they been aboard the train,
they no doubt would have pursued the
same tactics they employed on the
Oakes-Jamestown run, when, just to
show that they were operating the
train they would permit the engine
crew to run a few miles, stop on the
prairie for a few minutes, and then
make another short distance.
The I. W. W.'s are making their
way north toward some central mo
bilizing point, it is believed, although
the men themselves refuse to gay.
61-2 MIES BETTER
WILLISTON STREETS
CITY COMMISSION WILL EXPEND
$16,000. FOIl GRADING AND
GRAVELING
Six and a half miles of residence
streets graded and graveled is one
of the items among the civic im
provements that will be realized dur
ing the present season in Williston.
The city commission reached the
conclusion last spring that better
streets is one of the city's most urgent
needs, and since the graveling that
has been done on First avenue east
and First avenue west has proven so
satisfactory, it was decided to extend
the work to the greater part of the
remaining residence streets.
Advertisements for prices on the
work brought bids from J. G. Hard
ing and Foster & Hanna, both local
firms. The bids of the latter firm
was about $4000 below Mr.Harding's
offer, and after the necessary provis
ions as to specifications and bonds,
had been arranged, they were award
ed the contract for the sum of $16,048.
The specifications of the work call
for the moving of 100,000 cubic yards
of earth and the surfacing of 155.200
square yards to the depth of three
inches. The contract is to be com
pleted by Jan. 1, 1917.
The good appearance of the streets
that have already been graveled give
an idea of what a vast improvement
this work will be in the way of bet
ter drained and dried thoroughfares.
Contracts for the construction of
five blocks of sidewalks and cross
walks in the western part of the city
were awarded to J. G. Harding.
Farm Club Excursion
To Nesson Valley
Main street was made lively this
morning by an influx of Missouri
Ridgers to start on their excursion
and picnic to Nesson Valley.
The Missouri Ridge Club, accom
panied by some of their friends from
Williston township and Williston will
make the round trip to the beautiful
Nesson Valley, inspecting crops and
farms en route. The padty will eat
their picnic dinner under the trees at
Herman A. Nelson's Bonanza Farm.
Under the management of the Wil
liston Commercial club local auto
owners co-operated with the farm
club in conveying the large party over
the trip. County Agent Hall and Sec
retary Morrill of the Commercial club
accompanied and assisted the excur
sion. The Missouri Ridge people are
especially fortunate in having a splen
did day following the refreshing rains
of the last two nights.
James Gleason Makes
Escape From Prison
James Gleason, one of the convicts
who recently effected their escape
from the Bismarck penitentiary, is
recalled by the Williams County jail
officials. Gleason killed a man in
northern Mountrail county and after
confessing the crime was brought to
the Williams county jail and received
a 15 year sentence. Gleason, who was
a man of 25 and a gambler by occu
pation, did considerable boastful talk
ing to the other inmates of the jail,
saying, among other things, that he
had never done a day's work in his
life and never intended to.

APPROPRIATION FOR
WILLISTON PROJECT
$50,000 FOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR
POWER PLANT AND IRRIGA
TION
Congress has just passed and the
President has signed a bill including
and appropriation of $50,000 for the
Williston Project of the U. S. Recla
mation Service.
This appropriation is intended to
cover the expenditures incident to de
velopment of electrical energy on the
contract for light and power for the
City of Williston, the cost of repairs
to the irrigation system in the spring
of 1917, and cost* of pumping water
for irrigation for the month of June
1917 which is the last month in the
fiscal year.
It is understood that not all of this
money will be needed in any event
but the appropriation is made on the
basis of an estimate made in the Wil
liston office as a measure of prepared
ness for such extent of work as may
be decided upon.
Loan and Insurance
Departments Move
To better facilitate the handling of
its growing business the First Loan
and Investment Company will move
from its present quarters in the rear
of the First National Bank, with
which institution it is affiliated, into
the commodious room next south of
the bank, until recently occupied by
E. Van Antwerp's furniture store.
The insurance department of the
First National, under the manage
ment of Fred Weatherwax, will share
the new quarters with the loan com
pany. The space to be occupied will
be refinished and remodelled to fit it
for the purposes of these offices. Mr.
Bergman, manager of the loan com
pany, expects to move within a short
time.
At a later date it is probable that
the additional room will be finished to
match the elegant style of the First
National and a direct connection made
by a doorway through the wall.
Funeral Services
For L. L. Lampman
A large concourse of the friends of
late L. L. Lampman gathered at
the family residence on East Broad
way Friday afternoon, July 28, for
the funeral services, which were held
under the trees in the open air.
Rev. F. S. Hollett had been sum
moned from Fargo to conduct the
services, which were simple but beau
tifully impressive. After giving a
brief sketch of the life of the de
ceased, Rev. Hollett talked informal
ly but with great feeling of the life
and characteristic traits of the man
whose remains lay before him. Hay
ing a number of years ago dwelt in
the same house with the deceased and
his family, Rev. Hollett spoke with
an intimate personal touch which went
home to all hearers.'
The floral offerings were beautiful
and nrofuse, and appropriate music
was furnished by the quartet.
A large number accompanied the
remains to Williston Cemetery where
interment was made.

SYRIAN CITIZENS
VISITED BY ARCHBISHOP OF
BAALBEC—DRIVEN TO AMERI
CA BY THE GREAT WAR
Williston's citizens of Syrian ex
traction have been highly honored this
week by a visit from one of the high
est dignitaries of the church of their
native land, the Greek Orthodox
church.
llis Grace the Right Tv,'\ ivnd Ger
manos, Archbishop of Baalbec Syria,
accompanied by a priest of the church,
Rev. Agapios Golam, arrived in the
city Saturday evening and were met
by* a large delegation of his people.
Sunday morning at ten o'clock vlu
archbiship, assisted by his priest, sang
high mass—from St. Clirysostom—
at the Episcopal church, which is the
church to which the Syrian communi
cants of the Greek church look for
religious offices, in the absence of an
RT. REVEREND GERMANOS
organization of their own. The ser
vices were very largely attended and
the occasion was recognized as one of
rare distinction.
His Grace, the Archbishop, and Rev.
Golam have been royally entertained
at the homes of their people during
the week. The A. Munyer, E. Mun
yer, Forsley, and Jermanus homes be
ing notable among those to do honor
to the distinguished guests.
Rev. N. E. Elsworth, Rector of St.
Peters church, and Hon. W. B. Over
son were among the guests at dinner
on several of these occasions.
The visit of His Grace and his
priest to America is an incident grow
ing out of the war of Europe's na
tions, now in progress two years. The
day before Austria declared war on
Servia these digntaries embarked for
Odessa. Russia. Learning of the event
that was to shake the Old World to
it's foundation, and knowing well the
danger into which their intended
journey would take them, they chang
ed ships in the Mediterranean sea and
came to the United States and will
doubtless remain until the war is
over.
Since the war began the Syrian
people along with kindred nations
have suffered terribly from food
shortage and persecutions by the
Turks. Church officials in particular
have been the objects of a murderous
foe. The Archbishop states that no
less than eight of his bishops have
been killed since the war began. An
article contributed by the local relief
committee in last week's issue of The
Graphic, told the dire need of the peo
ple of those lands.

Golam expect to leave for Fargo to-

A GAME AND A SHUTOUT EACH
—FAMOUS TRAVELERS GET
ONE RUN IN 2 GAMES
Before what was undoubtedly the
largest number of people ever
drawn to Bruegger Park entirely by
a base ball attraction the "Oppor
tunes" and the much touted All Na
tions played two fast and thrilling
games Sunday afternoon.
The ranks of Williston fans were
.^welled by others from many sur
rounding vicinities- until the crowd
numbered between 1200 and 1500 peo
nle. And they were all well pleased
by the showing of the local team, the
only objection being that the games
were not longer. An agreement for
two seven-inning games was entered
into by Manager Clarence Marshall in
order to be safe against the possibility
of encroaching on the time after six
o'clock. As it turned out there was
plenty of time for nine innings in the
second game and that much more
chance for Williston to win the game,
but after the agreement was made
and the visitors were ahead it would
have been unsportsmanlike not to
stick to our word.
The All Nations are a team of in
dividual stars who have also become
a well organized machine. In Donald
son, the negro pitcher and Mendez
the black Cuban pitcher and all-round
player the All Nations have two play
ers who are excelled in playing ability
by not a score of players in the big
leagues and the pair would be in the
leagues except for their color.. The
rest of the team are all exceptionally
strong in all departments of tne game.
For fourteen innings the "Oppor
tunes" held the visitors to a single
run while the local pitchers, Brown
ing and Ruyle allowed them but five
scattered hits, the run made result
ing from an error.
In the first game Williston scored
six in the 4th and two in the 5th on
a combination five hits, and two er
rors by the A-Ns.
There were errors on each side, the
result of hard hitting, but there was
also much fast fielding and numerous
thrilling plays.
Monday the local team went to Sid
ney and played two games with the
All Nations. They were played on a
VP»v
voh-tVi ground and were ragged
exhibitions. The Williston players
were- in poor condition after the hard
games of the day before and lost both
contests, 9 to 2 and 8 to 5.
In the first of the Williston games
the Opportunes defeated the famous
cosmopolitan aggregation 8 to 0, al
lowing them but one hit and never a
possible chance to score.
In the second erame the visitors put
the great Donaldson in the box to
avoid a second defeat. He held the
locals to a single hit, and allowed no
runs. This was Williston's sixth game
lost this season out of forty-four play
ed, and the only shut-out they have
suffered.
The figures for the games:
First game— R. H. E.
Williston 8 5 2
All Nations 0 13
Batteries: Williston—Browning and
Immings. All Nations—Kinnen and
Evans.
Second game— R. H. E.
Williston 0 13
All Nations 14 1

The umpirine of Rigdon of Fairview

satisfaction.
