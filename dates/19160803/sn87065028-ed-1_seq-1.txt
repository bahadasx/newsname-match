RUSSIAN ADVANCE HALTED
SITUATION IN SOMME REGION
IS PRACTICALLY SAME AS
LAST SUNDAY.
London, August 2. -Violent bat
tles are being fought by the Russians
and Austro-German forces virtually
on the entire front from the Pripet
river marshes in Russia southward
to the region of Buczaez in Galac'a
ja distance of about 200 miles.
Comparative calm prevails in the
French front except near Verdun.
West and south of the Thiamont
work, a German attack was put
down by the French gun3, and south
of the work the French progressed
in a grenade attack. The Germans
on the Vaux-Chenois front took
some French trenches, but were
driven out. ,
The situation in the Somme re
gion has undergone practically no
change since the concerted advanca
by the French and British last Sun
day and the capture from the Brit
ish Monday of a narrow front they
had taken from the Germans west of
Fourneaux wood.
The Russians who have reached
the western bank of the Stokhad
river, near Stolysva, have been
' forced to, sustain a heavy counter
attactc by German infantry which
Petrograd says was repulsed. Ber
lin asserts that jn this fighting tha
Russians are exhausting themselves
in futile attempts to advance and
that they have been thrown back
three times near Smolary. Northeast
of tht Kovel-Kovno railway, Berlin

Forsk, while Viennat says that
west and northwest of Utsk the
Russian attacks have ceased "ob

sustained."

Washington, I). C, August 2.
The present week marks the comple
tion of two years of hostilities in
Kurope. Attempts to guage its bur
den to all the powers involved have
resulted in a calculation that the di
rect cost of the struggle to the
present tune i m eK of
000,000,000. The total military ex
peiKiiiureg in me first year was ap
proximately $17,500,000,000. For
the second year it is estimated at
fully $28,000,000,000.
These figures represent simply
the expenditures for carrying on
hostilities. They do not allow for
the destruction of cities, railways,
ships, factories, warehouses, bridges,
roads or agricultural values. Neither
do they allow for the economic loss
through the killing and maiming of
men, the loss of production in occu
pied territories, the decrease in
stocks or food, metal and other ma
terials, the derangement of the ma
chinery of distribution, or the cost
f pension. They measure In a
common term the expenditure of
capital which to the governments
concerned, will in the end be trans
lated for the most part into perman
ent additions to their national debt.
Moments will range supreme at
Lake Park tonight, when the Merry,
Merry Minstrels will give a per
formance for the benefit of the
Choctaw Club, and sweet singers will
awaken echoes in the sylvian forests
which surround the pavillion. An
excellent program has been arrang
ed for the occasion and some of the
most talented amateurs of Columbus
and surrounding towns will partici
pate therein. The young men have
been rehearsing for several weeks
and the entertainment promises to
be a meritorious one in every re
spect.
Mr. W, G. Zwingle will preside as
interlocutor, and the end men will
be Messrs. Robert Young, Battle
Sessums, Earl Moss, Frank Patton,
Dave Sessums and Frank Jamieson,
while the vocal choir includes such
talented soloists as Messrs. Oscar
Burris, William Burris, Paul Zwin
gle, Leo Flynn, Webb Smith, Le

pared and this feature of the per

ROBT. L. SIMPSON GOES TO AT.
LANTA TO REPRESENT
SOUTHERN.
If you want to see a rod minstr!
in Starkville Wednesday show go to Lake Park tonight Ad-lem,
Mr. T. B. Perkerson. of New Sa-
iem, was in tne city on business yes
terday, j
Robert L Simpson, who for sev
eral years was assistant general
freight agent of the Southern Rail
way in this city, and who since 1907
has served the company as general
freight agent in Birmingham, has
been transferred to Atlanta, where
he will be in direct charge of solici
tation in the south and southwest.
Regarding the transfer the Birming
ham News in a recent issue, says:
'Robert L. Simpson, general
freight agent of the Southern Rail
way in Birmingham since 1907, has
been transferred to Atlanta as gen-
ral freight agent, to be in direct
harge of general solicitation in the
south and southwest. His office will
also rpecialize on coal traffic in the
territory named. Other than "Bob"
Simpson there is no better freight
man in the Birmingham district, and
the announcement of the change
causes some suprise. Mr. Simpson's
work in the future will be on broad
er lines. '
"Mr. Simpson will be succeeded in
Birmingham by James W. Hunter,
assistant general freight agent at
Mobile, who is well known in this
section, having been connected with
the office of L. Green, now one of
the executives in the freight depart
ment of the Southern, in . the late
nineties. He was nudt a.-ksistartt
freight agent at Selma, and for the
la-st few years has been in Mobile.
He is credited with bdng one of the
besti freight men in the ( south, and
has made a big reputation with the
system. He will be succeeded at Mo
bile by J. H. Andrews, now division
freight agent at Raleigh. Mr. An
drews is a son of the late A. B. An
drews, first vice-president of the
Southern Railway and prominent for
yr in North Carolina.
