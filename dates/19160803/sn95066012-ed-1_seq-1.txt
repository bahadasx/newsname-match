Submarine Disappears Unharmed
With No Enemy Craft in Sight
REACHED OPEN SEA IN SAFETY
Tugs Reported That Submarine Was
In Position to Submerge When
Last Seen.
Norfolk, Va.. Aug. a. The Ger
man submarine merchantman Deutach
land passed quietly out of. the Virginia
Capos at 8.30 o'elock tonight on its
homeward voyage, apparently unob
served by the Allied warship patrol
waiting outside the three mile limit.
The Deutsehland was accompanied
to the Capes only by tire tug Thomas
P. Titnmins which had conveyed It
dawn the bay from Baltimore and by a
newspaper dispatch boat.
Its departure to sea followed an
eighteen milo dash through the lower
Chesapeake bay. After proceeding
slowly most of the way down, the
Deutsehland increased its power at
(i.30 o'clock and reached the Capes
iust after dusk. None of the Allied
cruisers was visible as it passed
through.
The trip of the submarine and the
convoying tug down Chesapeake Bay
from Baltimore was Started under
ideal conditions. Not a cloud was in
the sky as the submersible increased
its speed to nineteen knots soon after
clearing Baltimore harbor. The tug
immediately tell in behind and by
dark was 5nn yards to the stern.
Bay steamships passingup and down
had their attention attracted to the
submarine by the brilliance of its
lights, especially that ou the peris
cope. They cast their searchlights on
the submersible and as each of the
vessels recognized the Peutchland a
salute of thre whistle blasts were
blown. The submarine answered each
salute with its whistle.
At 1.30 o'clock this morning, while
passing Solotnon's Island, the. last of
the vessels with searchlights was it.ss
ed. By that time all the members of
the crew except two had disappeared
from the deck. One of these men was
standing well forward, a lead line for
sounding in his hand, and the other
was at the stern.
Those aboard the submarlen and
the tug apparently were worried by
the presence of a newspaper yacht, a
speedy craft which kept up with the
essels without difficulty. The tug
especially kept close watch on the
yacht ,aud was quick to take up a
position between It and the submarine
whenever the opportunity presented
Use!!.
Whether the U-Roat submerged be
fore it reached the three mile limit is
not known. The two accompanying
boats only know that it disappeared
unharmed, and to all appearances had
a clear field ahead to a point where It.
could submerge completely in safety.
Half an hour after the last light of
the Deutschalnd had disappeared, the
Timmins, seemingly satisfied with its
work, turned back and headed up
Chesapeake ha for Baltimore.
During part of the day the Deutsch
land had remained hidden at a cove
up Chesapeake bay.
F'or several hours before the begin
ning of the final dash It lay in a se
eluded retreat near Tangier Island
about fifty miles above Cape Henry.

GEN. BOTHMER IN DANGER
His Army Apparently Caught Between
Russian Detachments and Fac
ing Envelopment.
London, Aug. 3. The ultimate Bus
siau occupation of Kovel and Lcni
berg and the retirement Of the Atistro
Herman line of defense beyond the
Bug river are now regarded at l'etro
grad as a foregone conclusion. The
armies of Gens von Boehm-Krni j'.U
and Von Linslngen, which have been
badly crippled In their efforts to hold
back the advancing right wins of Gen.
Brussiloff's forces, have been forest
to retreat to a point which leaves
open the approaches to these two im
portant centers an dthe Russians in
both regions have begun an encircl
ing movement which ll slowly but ap
parently Irresistibly closing in upon
the two cities said a dispatch from
I'ettograd last night.
The German loss of the Stokhod
crossings and the recently announced
Russian crossing of the. river leaves
no important line of defense before
Kovel except a natural barrier con
sisting of a wide swamp which un
doubtedly will retard the Russian
progress. But this movement from the
west along the route midway between
the Sarny-Kovel and lovno-Kovel
railways, in conjunction with the Rus
sian pressure brought trom the south
in the region of Vladimir-Volynski,
both of which are successfully de
veloping, despite all German counter
macks, is considered as making the
outcome assured.
The operations against the Ger
mans are also having an important
effect in facilitating the advance
igalnst the Austrian I defending l.cm-
berg, since they enable the Russians
to exeit pressure against the Aus
trian left Hank and increase that
brought upon l.emberg from Brody
and from the south. where Gen.
etchitzky's troops are successfully
traversing the Hooded Dniester region
and arc the threatening the Calitiun
ipital along the route leading
through Stanislau and llalicz. It is
unofficially reported that the Germans
have already begun their retirement
from Kovel and are preparing to fall
back on Brest-Kitovsk. Chnlm and the
general line of defense following the
Bug river.
According to unofficial dispatches
received at London from Betronad,
the Russian advance against Kovel
c( utilities. Gen Kaledlnes' troops,
the dispatches say. have pushed for
ward 10 miles since they crossed the
bend of the Stokhod river, which
would place them only 10 miles from
Kovel.
Interest Is now centered in the pre
dicament of Gen. von Bothmer's army.
These forces are threatened on the
northern flank by the Russian prcs
sure between Kovel and Brody. and
at the southern end of the line by Gen
Letchltcky's advance toward Stanis
lau and across the Dehityn-.Iablonitza
railway. It thus appears that unless
GtU von Bothmer ads promptly he is
In danger of envelopment. In addi
tion, should Gen. Kaledines succeed
in getting the Kovel l.emberg railway
direct communication between the
Genitalis In the north ami the Austrl
nns in the south would be destroyed.

Cov-
LondOn, Aug. 2. While the last two
days have seen little beyond isolated
fighting on the Somtne front, the
struggle at Verdun has broken out
afresh.
Following the failure of an exci p
tionally strong German attack yester
day west and south of the tiiaumont
field work, on the east bank of the
Mouse, the French today attacked in
echelon on a front of a little more
than three miles, from the Meuse at
Vacherauvllle as far east as Floury.
Several German trenches and points
d'appui were captured, with 000 pris-
oneis ami about ten machine guns, ac
cording to the French War Office com
IDUnlqne issued this evening.
The Germans immediately launched
a counterattack in the wood east of
Vacherauvllle, but they were repulsed
with grenades.
In the region east and southeast of
the village of Fleury (the Vauxle
Cbapltre Wood and Be Chenoia) the
lighting which began yesterday con
tinued last night with considerable
violence. The French War Office re
ports that the Germans by the use of
asphyxiating gases were able to gain
a little ground in the Vaux-le-Chapltre
Wood and at Be Chenois. Klscwherc
on this front the Germans 'were re
pulsed The Berlin War Office, in speaking
of this lighting, says that a hill sal
lent northeast of Fort Souville was
captured, while "we pressed the ene
my hack considerably in thd moun
tain forest and in the small Lauffl
Wtod." Berlin reports the capture
of about H40 men In this operation.
On the Somnie front the French cap
tared a strongly fortified work be
tween the Hem Wood and the Monacu
farm, (just north of the Bomme, east
cf Pennine, i This position, the
French night communique says, con
tained about 00 dead Germans.
The' French also took a German
trench northwest of Doiilecourt, at the
extreme southern end of the Anglo
French line of advance. Two enemy
counterattacks en this position were
later repulsed.
Little of importance is reported
from the British front. The British

Preliminary Production Surpasses

LEADING PARTS ARE STRONG
Reputed Critic Declares Mob
Superior in its Work to Pro
fessionals. ia
Written by Miss Laura Rogers.
The dress rehearsal of Julius
Caesar, which took place last night In
Clark's Woods, proved thai Benning
ton has achieved another triumph.
The audience was made up of a
little group of people who had been
busy with the humbler details ol the
great play equipping soldiers with
spears and bucklers; instructing sen
atots in the art of draping togas; in
ducing small members of the mob to
give up large-sized costumes to their
big colleagues etc. Some of the
helpers had been to rehearsals and
knew all about the cues und exits and
entrances and the correct form of
greeting Caesar and the proper
method of shaking hands with Brutus.
All things considered, they were not
good material for an enthusiastic
audience. They looked wearily at tho
grassy stage. With Its forest back
ground. Then brightened and said.
"Well, it's a perfectly beautiful place,
anyway '
The band played an overture. Then
truck up a stirring march, and with a
rush ftom the dim woods the play be
gan. With a gasp of surprise, the
spectators saw the drudgery of cos
tumes and lights and stage arrange
ments converted into the life of an
cient Rome. They saw the familiar
scenes, not as fragments, as at rehear-
als, but as the play. And thev were
astonished to find that they became
as absorbed In it as if they had not
known It by heart. There were no
surprises of plot or action In store for
them and yet they looked and listened
spellbound. There was. however. on
continuous surprise; that we Ben
ningtonians were actually able to give
Julius Caesar as it was being given
B Is a matter for a pardonable pridt
that will surely swell with each per
formance that our town has been able
to achieve such a production. In the
first place, not many towns have
among their citizens a professional
actor of tho recognized ability ol Ar
tliur Klliot. and it is a privilege to see
an actor of Mr. Klliot's calibre as Bru
tun. Anyone who knows of Mr. Kl
liot's theatrical record, particularly
in Shakespearean roles, will not be
surprised at the excellence of his per
formancethe surprises will come In
the cases of our townsmen ac tors who
have been concealing their dramatic
bent under other professions and oc
cupations. Mr. Mills, as Cassias, must
be seen to be believed. His oft it
earring scenes with Mr. Klliot will de
light their audiences, for in them we
see not two modern men, hut the
veritable Brutus ami Cassius the
illusion is cotnnlete. Probably no
member of the cast will call forth
more wonder and admiration than K.l
ward Jenney, who plays Mark Antony.
His famous "Friends, Romans, conn
trymen" speech will sway the audi
ence no lets than the stage mob he Is
addressing.
And so it goes part alter part Is
so well taken that it would not sliann
the professional stage; moreover
ninny of the small parts of one or two
lines are given with a finish that has
much to do with the smoothness of
the general effect.

is an accredited theatrical critic

andscape Gardener Says Tricks
of His Trade Would Improve
SHRUBS THAT DO NOT CONCEAL
Grand Pierre Declares That Beauty
is Enhanced by the Breaking of
Rigid Lines.
Of course, one's own baby is the
cutest baby who ever lived, and one's
dog la the smartest thing that ever
did stunts. And so, to everybody
hailing" from Bennington, Benning
ton "is the finest little city you ever
saw."
And that is true, at least, relative
ly. However, heartless strangers
might happen to have seen cuter bab
ies than the one presented to them as
the cutest, und. possibly, they may
have visited towns or cities which are,
at least in some respects, superior to
Bennington.
At any rate, a stranger is able to
bring into discussion the outside
Ioiiit of view, the "fresh eye," and is,
if he Is familiar with the principles
and the practice of civic improvement
work and landscape architecture, he
is usually able to make suggestions
which may help making a city and Its
home grounds even more beautiful.
It is in that spirit of helpfulness
that praise and criticisms which will
be made in these articles will he ex
pressed! Now for the story itself:
In discussing Bennington street by
street, we may jut as well begin
w ith Main street and say right at the
beginning that it Is remarkable for
the fact that, with one single excep
tion.' all of the home grounds are re
markably well kept and many of them
very beautiful. That Is a very strong
point because beauty does not con
sist solely in the display of excellence
in some parts of the picture. Its re
iiuireuieiiis art; not merely intrinsic
worth, but absence of ugliness in all
of Its parts as "well.
This praise does not mean that
there is no room for improvement
There is, however, what may be crit
icized Is certainly not due to neglect
or absence of civic pride, but to ap
parent lark of familiarity with one of
the principles, und some of the tricks
i the trade of the landscape arm
tect. Your city builders seem to
have forgotten that the human eye is
exceedingly curious. It is at all times
desirous to make discoveries. More
over, it abhors monotony. It does
not like a succession of straight lines
because they are monotonous but
it loves to guess what It does not see
at a glance. Hence what is known to
the landscape gardner as "partial con
cealment of principal objects." A
monumental building, when seen all at
once, does not provoque more than a
passing glance, but if partially con
cealed by vegetation, the eye iii"olun-
tarily seeks to discover what is hid
den.
I his point is well illustrated with
the really beautiful vistas which
most of your cross town streets offer
The most interesting part of these
vis'i'.s are 1101 the nice features to be
st en on e n wr ;. . i ru n u u
hut what is bareh visible, v :,nt one
guesses exists in the distance.
If. for Instance, we walk on School
street, let us look especially at St.
Peter's Church, the parsonage of the
Congregational church, that church it
self, and dually even at the plain
square building. Hitchle, partially hid
den behind the drooping branches of
stately elm trees. Kven that last
building Is attractive to the eye. Tut
as we advance, as it begins to appear
in its entity, it becomes uninteresting
and there remains nothing for tlin
ee to discover, and one involuntarily
turns the head to seek another sight.
Then we face the Masonic Temple
with Its pleasing;, graceful outlines,
but, unless we are especially Inier
osted In architectural design, in a few
seconds o win have Seen all thai In
terests us about 11 and we will be
overcome wun soinetning akin to a
feeling of dlsappolntim nl that there
Is nothing else worth looking at on
that spot.
Let us suppose that It had been pos
sible to plant a tall tree at a conven
ient distance' of the Temple, hiding
pnrt of Its features The beholder
would have turned around to have a
good look at what the tree at llrst con
coaled and. as a mailer of fact, by
seeing only part of the building nt a
time, he would see. mid permanently
remember, more of Us beauties than
by seeing It nt a glance. In default
of a tall tree. If n lew shrubs were
planted nt the base of the building. Its
Wholg aspect would be lmmensel on
ham ed.
Anothflf Instance of the application
of this principle Is offered by the
High School building. It Is a ninnu
ment of which Bennington may b
proud. The effort made there Is a
