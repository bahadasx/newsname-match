OPENING OF
TOBACCO MARKET,
HKH PRICES FOR THE "GOLDEN
WEED** GREATLY CHEER
THE FARMERS.
n,L- Tr: * *.k./wn morlraf

opened Tuesday morning: for the
sale of such tobacco as has been left
by the recent destructive storm.
Three warehouses were open for
business; a full corps of buyers was
on hand. Most of these are men
- who haye been on this market for
the past four years and are well acquainted
with the farmers, and represent
the leading manufacturers of
the world. The opening sale proved
to be a very satisfactory surprise to
everyone. Prices were far above
expectation and tobacco that sold
last year for one and two cents the
nnnnd broueht four and six cents
Tuesday, while the better grades
ranged in price from seven to twenty-three
and a half cents which was
the high figure of the day and was
paid for 666 pounds raised by J M
Hsdale, of the Cedar Swamp section,
and sold at Nelson's warehouse.
The aggregate amount sold Tuesday
was estimated at 125,000 pounds
which brought an average of ten
and a half cents. The high prices
paid Tuesday are indicative of the
~ strong demand for tobacco by manu~
facturers. It also served as a tonic
to the farmers and merchants in this
community.
A good deal of the tobacco on the
warehouse floors Tuesday had been
- -- * .e
there for two weens, ana some 01
it represented curings that were
made before the storm played such
havoc with the crop. It is therefore
probable that the tobacco sold
this week was made up of the cream
of the season's crop, and that the
limit of prices was reached atyester4*
day's sale when 33c w$g paid for 190
pounds, sold at Nelson's warehouse
by WI Eppe, of the Mouzon section.
The first sale took place at 11
o'clock at Gorrell's New warehouse
and was attended by a large crowd
of spectators among whom were a
number of ladies. From the moment

THE STORM IN WILLIAMSBURG
As Seen by Editor ol BIshopvllle
Leader & Vindicator.
On receiving the news that his
brother was seriously hurt during the
storm of July 14,the editor took the
first train to go to him. Long before
he reached Kingstree he could see
from the car windows that Lee and
Sumter counties had missed the cen- ,
ter of the storm and, comparatively
SDeakine. sustained very little loss
compared to the ruin of crops and (
destruction of property from Manning
down through the entire county
of Williamsburg. Black river was
one seething torrent of angry water
from the banks atSalters to the very ,
town limits at Kingstree, a distance
of more than three miles. All the
old fields that were once cultivated
on the island in the swamp or intervening
ridges looked like a vast inland
sea or lake. Between the river
and the depot at Kingstree the torrent
of water pouring through the
canal at Kingstree washed out forty
feet or more of the railroad embank
* j a?i
ment,wnicn causea ine iram iuticc^
along over the temporarily reconstructed
roadbed, along which were
strewn all sorts of debris from Kingstree,
consisting of parts of negro
shanties, furniture, lumber, dead
chickens, pigs, cats or anything that
was caught in the mad onrush of the i
waters. On East Main street the
water was four to five feet deep in
the stores. The flood came on during
Friday night, and when the attendants
of the Williamsburg Live ,
nnmnonv Oflt t?"l thoir stnhlp
UWUUA WUUipnuj ftwv vv v?*vi*
they found their horses standing in
water over their backs and had to
swim to get out. With the exception
of the iron bridge over Black river,
nearly every bridge in the county
was washed away.
We found our brother, Dr J S ,
Cunningham, at his home at Indiantown
very badly but not fatally injured,
as we at first had heard that
he was. He, with his little granddaughter,
Bessie McCutchen, and a
little negro servant girl were the
only inmates of the house when the
storm came and had raged all day
Friday. Just about dark Bessie
thought it best to make a little fire
in her orandfather's room to dry out
the dampness, as he was on the bed
asleep. Whiie starting the fire, the
little negro girl screamed to Bessie
to run away, the chimney was falling.
Bess jumped to the bed,grabbed
her grandfather and told him to get
out of the room, as the chimney was
about to fall. He had gotten nearly
by the fireplace when the chimney
came down with a crash that threar
the mantelpiece with such violence
that it struck the doctor on the shoulder
so forcibly as to knuck him down
and for a little while he was dazed
from the fall. Recovering from the
shock, he found his left shoulder dislocated.
With splendid nerve and
strength, Bessie, with the aid of the
little negro girl and at the direction
of her grandfather, pulled the arm
back in place.
B> that time the storm was at its
worst,but the little negro girl braved
it all and went to a colored man's
house 200 or 300 yards off to arouse
him to go for help. So rapidly did
the branches and swamp? rise that
all bridges were washed away and
the negro came near being drowned
in giying notice of the doctor's condition.
So completely was he cut off from
help that after his son- and neighbors
got to him they could not procure
a doctor for him till Tuesday.
After an examination by Drs Jacols
and Scott of Fmgstree no bones wore
found broken but his arm and shoulder
were terribly bruised and mashed
and his shoulder had been dislocated.
When the editor left him last Monday
morning he was very cheerful for a
man of 85 with such a fearful hurt, I
and with no back?ot the doctors I
think he will soon be himself again.
%
It is truly pitiful to see the ruin of
crop3 down there. When we say ruin
we don't mean damage,for it was destruction,
especially to the tobacco
crop. To illustrate, Mr D E McCutchen,
one of the most extensive as
well as intensive farmers in that
county, had 15 acres of tobacco for
which he was offered by a tobacco
buyer just the day before the storm
$3000 in the field,and all that he will
get for it will be the sand lugs he has
in the barn curing, equal to about
$200. Mr John Cunningham,another
successful farmer, had ten acres for
which he was offered $2000, and he
won't get as much as $200. These
two instances are fair samples of
how the crops suffered in Williamsburg.
The crops through the upper
edge of Florence and through Dar'

same as in Lee and Sumter.
Everyone with whom we talked in
Williamsburg spoke of the fine crops
they had down there, the best in
years,but.alas! in 36 hours they have
the poorest prospect they have had
in years.

AN INTERESTING ACCOUNT
OF SOLDIER DUTY.
Camp Moore, Styx, Co I, 2nd Resrt,
July 31:?If you can find space in
your columns, we would like to have
you publish the following letter that
i somf ox uur menus majr auvw nun
we are getting along:
On Friday, the 21st inst, there
was a baseball game at Cedar Swamp,
(as some of you know). During the
game Lieut Chas L Smith appeared
on the grounds; shortly after he
had enlisted seven of the boys. We
left Kingstree on train No 89 at
11:30 p. m. We all had an idea
that some of us would fail to pass,
but we were disappointed.
1 Crossing Santee trestle that night
is one thing that will be fresh in
our memories for years to come.
We had heard that the water was
rising six inches every hour, and
was then up to the rails. When we
got there, all of us rushed for the
f platform or door and got on the
! steps; wc were preparing for the
worse, should it come, but God had
mercy on us and carried us safely
over. We arriyed in Charleston at
3:15 a. m. Lieut Smith lined us up
and took us on a "hike" through
the city. We returned to the sta'
tion at 8 o'clock and boarded the
" "Carolina Special" for Styx. On account
of a freight train being
: wrecked we were delayed about an
* hour and arrived here at 4:45 p. m.
' The first thing we saw as we step'
ped from the train, was crowds and
crowds of khaki clad boys. As we
1 passed them in bunches strolling
1 along the road from Styx to the
' camp each one would try to guy us.
They began to sayr "You had a good
home, but you left." and "join the
army, boys, and get rich." We tried
not to pay any attention to what
they were saying, but we could not
help but feel a little blue; however,
we are some of the boys now, and
are having an excellent time.
We rise at 5:00 a. m.f have breakfast
at 6:00, at 6:30 we fall in line
and for thirty minutes are given
lessons in physical culture, then we
are taken on a hike in double quick
time for about four hundred yards.
Since we have been here, they

The teams in the 1st and 2nd
regiments winning the most games
will play each other in Columbia
some time in September.
MessrsWill McCullough and Isham
Boykin are the battery for Co I, 2nd
Reg, Timmonsville, and have played
three games, winning all. The first
game was played with Co K of Florence,
the score being 10 to 0 in favor
of our boys. The second game
was played with the Machine Gun
Co of the 1st Regt, the score being
3 to 1 in our favor. In this game
they got only two hits off of McCullough.
The third game was played
with Troop A of the Cavalry, the
score being 5 to 1 in our favor, with
only one hit off of McCullough. We
feel sure that our boys, (Cedar
Swamp boys I mean), will play the
first regiment in Columbia for the
championship, and silver trophy cup.
Now, if you would like to hear
something about what we get to eat,
I will tell you. For breakfast, we
have grits, breakfast strip, bread
and coffee. For dinner, we have
rice, beef, tomatoes, Irish potatoes,
pickles and bread. For supper, the
menu is the same as it is for breakfast.
