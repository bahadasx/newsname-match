Some person prophesied that
this would be a cool summer
Supposedly that such a conting
ency would happen and which i
it did would cover the seer with
renown as one gifted with large
forecast, and able to reveal the
events of the future. Whatever
may have been the purpose it is
plain from the experience of the
last few days that that, prognos
ticaterknew no more about it
than the rest of us poor mortals
know about it. It has been about
the hottest weather we have had
for a good many years, and from
which it would be a real Godsend
to be relieved so that a measura
ble degree of comfort might be
enjoyed.
Our camp meeting has been
open for more than half a week
and notwithstanding the hot
weather and great supply of dust,
large crowds have been in atten
dance during the time. 1 sup
pose they have abte speakers to
interest the attendants and in
struct the teachable in the way
of right living and righteousness,
' A goodly number of our people
attended the home-coming of the
Webster school yesterday after
noon, where a regular program
suitable for the occasion was ren
dered, On- last. Friday night I M. Pe
itersime's class of young married
people held their monthly meet
ing at the home of A. C. Seman,
west of New Harrison. Report
says eightyone parents and chil
dren were present to enjoy the
occasion and took part in the ex
ercises and lunch seryed.
Some of our people attended
the Hahn-Feeser reunion held on
the fair ground yesterday.
One week from tomorrow the
slate primary election for the
purpose of choosing candidates
for the various offices to be filled
at the November election will be
held. I suppose I venture noth
ing in saying the best persons,
the ones most fitted to serve, will
be chosen. Without doubt there
seems to be a large number of
persons to choose from, and sure
ly if divine agency directs in the
affairs of men the right person
will receive the endorsement of
his constituency. So mote it be.
Mrs. Kate Levering, late a res
ident of this place, now of Cov
ington, died and was burled at
that place today. Before mar
rying Mr. Levering she was the
widow of J. C. Hartzell, who
served as captain in one of the
companies of the 152d Regiment,
0. V. L, during the Civil war.
Mrs. Sarah A. Jackson, relict
of Eli P. Jackson, died and fun
eral services were held yesterday.
Word was received here today
of the death of Mary A. Seamon
. at Ithaca, Mich. She was a sis
ter of J. A, and Wm. H. Horner
and formerly lived here, but late
ly moved, with her husband, Wm.
Seamon, to the place where she
died. v
Joe Bowman of Muncie, Ind.,
was a visiter here over Sunday
with his father ir-law, Frank
Vanlue.

Judge Middleton.
Champaign county is to elect a
Common Pleas judge this fall and
we understand that Judge Mid-j
dleton of Urbana is a candidate
on the Republican ticket before
A
the primary .ext week. Judge
Middleton has occupied the Bench
in this county, when Common
leas judges were elected by dis-
ricts, and we believe gave ex
cellent satisfaction in the hand
ing of all cases coming before
him and stood high in the esti
mation of the Darke County Bar,
as well as with the attorneys
throughout the district. He is a
perfect gentleman, an able schol
ar, proacient in the law and one
of the most learned judges occu
pying the Bench today. The peo
ple of Champaign county, and es
pecially the Republicans, will
make a mistake and fail in their
duty if they do not return Judge
Middleton to the Common Pleas
Bench of that county, we sin
cerely believe, knowing what we
do of the man, and his success
will be most pleasing to his many
iiends here, both among our cit
izens and membeis of the Bar.
We wish to state that the Judge,
personally, has no knowledge of
this endorsement prior to his hav
ing,seen it in print and it is not a
political advertisement, simply a
small acknowledgement of his a
bility and fitness for the place he
seeks by one who knows him.

Boomeraflg Tactics.
"The campaign of former Gov
ernor Herrick for the Republican
nomination for United States Sen
ator has suffered seriously by dis
closures of unfair tactics employ'
ed in his behalf. For months the
methods have been a claim of es
tablishment of so-called Herrick
leagues throughout the state. In
very many instances apparently
these leagues are no other than
paper affairs. Worse still, names
of dead people have been used as
members of the league and cases
seem to multiply where names of
individuals were used as endors
ing Herrick when those individ
uals had not evei been consulted.
Tai3 has happened in our own
city, but here as in many other
places the incident was allowed
to pass without any special note
being made of it, In Darke coun
ty, however, this breach of good
taste and lack of disposition to
be just was so flagrant that a
merry row has occurred.
"The Darke county Herrick
managers, in order to make show
ing of a great Herrick organiza
tion locally caused form letters to
to be printed in behalf of the
Herrick Voters League carrying
along the side margin a long list
of well known officers and com
mitteemen. Thirtytwoof these
men, incensed, at the attempt
thus' tbbeUeIivered over to the
Herrick cause and repudiating
the scheme, have caused to be
published a statement not only
announcing that thev are not
members of the said league but
that the use of their names for
such purpose is 'being done by
parlies who have no authority
from us to di so and is a false
and malicious representation to
the Republican party.'
"To this statemenc they then
affix their signatures.
"Harry M. Daugherty, who ;s
also a candidate for the senator
ial nomination, when interviewed
concerning these developments
declared that his offica has evi
dence of similar illustrations in
various parts of the state. Mr.
Daugherty avows that Mr. Her
rick himself surely does not coun
tenance such condemnable meth
ods, that they are the work of
over enthused or injudicious cam-
paign managers, pun, says
ir i ?M t
Mr. Daugherty 'my opponent
owes it to himself as well as the
other candidates to prevent the
continuance of such tactics and
also to repudiate them.' "The

Water Glass Used to
Preserve Eggs.
Water glass solution frequent-
ly used by housewives for pre
serving eggs is made and used as
follows: Use one quart of water
glass to 10 quarts of water that
has been boiled. Pour into a
deep vessel when cooled. Fresh
eggs can be put into ths solution
from time to time until the ves
sel is filled, allowing the eggs to
be covered by 2 inches of the so
lution.
Eggs should not be washed be
fore being pkced in the solution
as this opens the pores of the
shell and reduces its keeping
qualities. Keep the preserved
eggs in a cool place.

Columbus, O. (Special.) In hi3
(andii!,i( y f0- ule Republican nomina
tion for I'niti d States senator from
Ohio, li. .M. i:aj.iierty is seeking not
alone to srat:: a;i ambition, but is
following v hr.i he believes, to be a
real and patriate duly to h:s party,
his stall' auj his country. His en

careful consideration and upon the ad
vice of men who. ivcotuii.ins party
fr-plty and lojalty, combined with a
brud and comprehensive view of
f'tatesmauship nml the needs of the
country, looked upon him as an ideal
candidate.
The history of. the Republican party
in Ohio, during the past twenty-five
years, is closely interwoven with the
career of Mr. Daugherty. His first
vote was one in behalf of the political
organization with which he has. since
been identified. He has never shirked
a duty nor never permitted himself to
wander away from the party faith.
Perhaps the most striking example of
loyalty which he ever gave, because
conditions mace it imperative that he
do so. was in 1!1, when the wave of
progressivism was at its height. He,
more than any other man in the state,
kept tiie Republicans intact and made
possible the organization in Ohio
HARRY M. DAUGHERTY.
Candidate For Republican Nomination
For United States Senator. ,
which it has today, and brought about
the election of Governor Willis and
other state officials. He never fal
tered under the moot trying condi
tions, but. aided by men of equal paitii
and character, refused to accept any
solution o? the problem except that
which meant for ultimate Republican
success. Had it not been for this the
party might now be utterly without
standing or i:o;(e of political success.
It takes a man of courage and stamina
to do these hings.
The only political elective office Mr.
Daugherty ever held was as a member
of the house of representatives from
his home county of Fayette, and there
he so conducted himself as to not
alone take a leading part in the delib
erations, but to win the approbation
of the people, his associates and his
constituents.
Mr. Daugherty has won his way in
life largely through the school of ad
versity, the best school to secure a
full training in the world. His earlv
life was on a farm, but with a desire
to study law and an ambition to ac
complish, he set about the task, doing
other things cn the side that he might
not fail, and was admitted to the bar.
His career in the legal profession has
been, as in all other things he has un
dertaken, a success, and he now
stands among the leading attorneys
in the state.
His activities have also taken him
Into the busit.ess world and there he
has shown his work. But through all
his career he has not forgotten his
start, his struggle to succeed, and so
he carries a kindly feeling and a mel
low heart for the people at large. He
possesses the fitting combination of
knowing not only the needs of those
who toil with their hands, but also
those Tho ave engaged iu commercial
and manufacturing enterprines, anu'
he is alive to the interests of both.
This is the combination which makes
for an ideal 1'nited States senator.
Mr. Daugherty has driven one thing
which vitally atec'.s the people home
with telHtig force in iiis campaign. He
has put the primary law on the grid
iron. Tt will to determined whether
money is to control the primaries or
the people are to rule, unhampered. If
money is to he vhe controlling factor,
then he very pertinently says it would
he well to return to tiro old conven?
tlon plan.
