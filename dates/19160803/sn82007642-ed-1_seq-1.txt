STRICKEN APPAUCMA.
3lblical Recorder.
Not in the history of North
Carolina, and seldom in the his
tory of the country, has there oc
curred such loss both oi property
fend of life by cloudburst and
f flood as that which on the fif-
teenth and sixteenth of July be
t fell our beautiful and . boasted
:;Land of the Sky.
; Thirty or more counties over
swept; eighty or a hundred lives
lost in the swollen waters; scores
;of railroad and county bridges
wept away; hundreds of farms
' robbed of their crops, and either
if
;; , piled deep in sand or eatan down
to the rocks; many humble homes
any lumber plants and cotton
lactones and grist mills, caught
and tossed like toys in the raging
jtorrents; landslides and wash
uts playing' havoc with rail
yoads and highways; towns and
Villages isolated from eash other
ind from the outside world;
grains marooned for days at va
rious points where the floods
taught them and cut them off,
ind thousands of summer visi
tors marooned at our mountain
jresorts; damage done which con
servative experts place at from
ten to fifteen million dollars; for
once and for the first time, the
strange cry for outside help to
keep at bay the wolf of want
coming from the most self-reliant
and most independent of our
people: all go to show that fair
Appalachia has been stricken to
the heart by this monumental
disaster.

ed until the eround was soggy
and the brooks were flush; then
more torrential became the down-
jjpour, then cloudbursts here and
tT there leaped down upon the head-
waters along
the Blue iudge,
east and west; then dams began
to burst one after another adown
the streams until their accumula
ted waters, sometimes wall-like
to the height of ten feet or more,
swept everything before them
in their uncontrollable onrush;
and vast was the ruin wrought
before the rivers ran down and
the flood assuaged
The Catawba, draining the lar
gest basin of the flood area, suc
cored by hundreds oi turbulent
tributaries, and spanned by
scores of dams which gave way,
rose fortv feet or more above
"normal and rushed seaward on
uch a rampage that no bridge
J ol Steel could withstand it, no
f v telegraph or telephone wires weie

jt it has supported along its banks
if was driven back aghast to the
f overlooking hills. The same story
nf devastation comes from the

effaceable scars in the great
' fcounty of - Wilkes and wrought

Stricken Appalachia!
But the men of the mountains
and of the rolling Piedmont are
not the men to either murmur at
their misfortune or idiy bemoan
their fate. In tears they have
buried their dead, but in hope

Is the War Nearioflts Enl?
One swallow' does not make a
spring, nor one victorious cam
paign a complete conquest. Nev
ertheless, it must be admitted
that it really looks as if the be
ginning of the end of the great
war was in sight. The neadlock
of months is apparently broken,
and thr "great drive" as the En
glish have been calling it is on.
For the first time since the strug
gle began we are. seeing real
team work by the Allies All their
forces in all fields are co-operating
as one army, and the result
is the 'giving back of the Ger
mans and Austrians everywhere.
The tremendous Russian drive
continues on the eastern front,
while in the west tne Freuch
have held their own and the
British have swept the Germans
back several miles along a battle
front of ninety miles. In the
south the tide of battle seems to
have turned, and the Italians are
pushing the Austrians before
them. For the moment Germany
is apparently amazed and dis
heartened. Whether she will re
cover heart and can summon up
strength sufficient to' stem the
tide, which is evidently setting
against her, is the question. But
it would not be surprising, judg
ing from present indicatious, if
the end would come in the only
way in which it can come before
the year is over. So mote it be!

by sympathetic friends through
out the State; and there is talk
of Federal aid in order to relieve
dire distress in certain quarters.
Let the cry for help be heard
and heeded until the stricken
home is rebuilt and the unfortu
nates among the proud and
mighty people are on their feet
And out of this, awful experi
ence will emerge a people better
ed by the discipline of adversity
and capacitated for the rebuild
ing of their neighborhoods on
yet securer fctundationss, civic,
social and religious. Let them
not forget to conserve the for
ests that crown the mighty hills
and hold back the destroying
waters. Let those who harness
the power of those swift moun
tain rivers build stronger dams
which will withstand the great
est pressure that can be brou't
against them. Let the bridge-
builders do their work hereafter
in Jview of the maximum floods
of uineteen-sixteen. Let no land
owner or tenant erect his resi
dence, whether palace or cot.,
in the danger zone.' And above
all, let us always look up, with
gratitude for His goodness and
with trust for His continued care,
to Hitu "who maketh the clouds
his chariot, and who walketh up
on the Atngs of the wind."
To our people in the stricken
highlands we send a message of
mingled condolence and good
cheer the one in sympathy for
their loss, the other to hearten
them iu their task. The flood has
receded. Tne rainbow of hope o
verspans the desolation. A new
day is shedding its efiulgence all
over Appalachia. Such prospects
are before us as never stirred or
impelled any people. "God's in
His heaven; all's well with the
world!" '

Poor Rich Woman.
So far as we know old Hetty
Green lived an irreproachable life
in so far as adherence to the De-
calogue is concerned; certainly
she was not guilty of any shock
ing infractions of the moral law.
It is questionable whether one
human being in the course of on
ly 50 years can collect $100,000,
000 honestly but if Hetty Green
robbed anybody we do not know
it. In casting up her account
with tiie world it does not mat
ter anyhow.
Hetty Green carried a certain
sort of responsibility greater
than rested on any other woman
in the world, and never realized
it. She had enormous power for
good in her hands and a needy
world around her; and "she sat
in her wheel chair at one of the
front windows of the parlor floor
of her house and gazed out over
the park, motionless for hours at
a time." Humanity passed in
an endless parade of opportunity
before that window; the destitute
who needed the bread that win
dow; the destitute, who needed
the bread that she might have
bought; the ignorant, who need
ed the instruction she might have
supplied; .the sick, for whom she
might have built hospitals; the
outcasts, for whom she might
have provided refuges the or
phan, the widow, the lame, the
halt and the blind, the broken
man and the fallen woman tram
ped past in an endless stream of
misery that she might have alle
viated. And she "she gazed out over
the park, motionless for hours
at a time."
Andrew Carnegie is an immen
sely rich man. Living or dead,
Andrew Carnegie is a rich man.
Some say he stole the three hun
dred million dollars that hegave
away; but nevertheless that mon
ey he had. When the body that
houses his soul is a shapeless
lump of clay there will be here in
Greensboro and in a thousand
other cities a noble building, de
dicated to the use of the public,
but recognfciKl by that public to
be Andrew Carnegie's and none
other's, forever. John D. Rock
efeller is exceedingly rich. He
has in bis possession certain
stocks and bonds he must Boon
surrender, and that consequent
ly belong to him only temporar
ily, but every spire and turret of
that city within the city of Chi
cago that his money erected and
threw open to his fellow men, is
Rockefeller's, now and hereafter.

There will be a march, if any of
the old soldiers so desires, a n d
the weather will permit.
The Committee earnestly re
quests that each old soldier of
the Camp will attend the Reun
ion for, in a short t ime, there will
be none of them left to attend
these annual meets. There have
been six members of tbe Camp
passed over the river since tur
ast meeting, and it will seem as
if seven were gone, as ourdeceas-
ed brother, Rev. J. M. Payne,
has been a regular attendant for
15 or 16 years, and always had
a kind word for each old soldier.
The people in and around the
town have expressed a willing
ness and desire to care for the
old soldier, but the committee
has decided tnat if Friday, the
18th, is a favorable day, the vet
erans will take dinner with the
out-of-town citizens, and they
are requested to bringluuch bas
kets, well filled, for their repast
on that day.
Come, everybody, to the Reun
ion, as this is election year, and
there will be an abundance of
speakers chock full of talk on
hand.
It is requested that each mem
ber of the fife and drum corps be
on hand to furnish music for the
occasion.'

A Telephonic Marvel.
Asheville Citizen.
The looping of Asheville with
San Francisco by long distance
telephone at Grove Park Inn
W ednesday night was a fete which
will be long remembered by those
fortunate enough to be present.
One hundred and forty people,
the majority of whom can not be
said to be much surprised at any
thing, marvelled and marvelled
again, and could hardly believe
the evidence of their own ears
when, sitting at the banquet
board, they heard the breaking
of the waves on the California!!
coast, three thousand miles away
No prophet of old would ever
have dared to predict such an
accomplishment; indeed, it is
more than likely that any such
utterance on his part would have
headed him for the stake iu the
not very distant past.
Atacostof several thousand
dollars, the Asheville Telephone
and Telegraph company, the
Southern Bell Telephone com
pany and the American Telephone
and Telegraph company, with
kindred organizations across the
continent, entertained the news-
paper publishers andtheirfriends
with a demonstration the magni
tude of which the human Jmind
can hardly grasp. The roll call
and the instantaneous answer of
the great cities of the United Sta
tes embraced in the network of
tho telephone system, created an
impression which will doubtless
last a lifetime. As they were
called in turn Lynchburg, Pitts
burgh, Chicago, Omaha, Salt
Lake City, Denver and San Fran
cisco promptly answered, the en-
tire journey being made from
Grove Park inn to San Francisco
being completed in less than three
minutes. A wonderful piece of
work, surely, and another testi
monial to the fact that man's in
ventive genius knows no limit.
The thought must have occur
red to many at the banquet board
that the general public has but a
poor idea of the countless difficul
ties and enormous expense with
which tho covering of the Ameri
can continent with a network of
telephone wires involves. Wfe
were told on Wednesday night
that 9,000,000 telephones and
21,000,000 miles of wire repre
