lira BOYS ENLIST FOR BORDER DUTY
Recruiting officer, Major H. U.

snlist men in the Oregon National
Guard duty on the Mexican border,
Chas. Ayers, son of Wm. Ayers and
Linus Judd, a young man who has
, , , ,
been living in Heppner the past year
answered the Major's call.
The young men went to Clackamas
this morning. After spending a week
there, they will become members of a
company which leaves for the south.
Portland and. the Willamette Val
ley have done more than their share,
according to Major Welch,' and it
was because of this that he is visit-
i g the towns of Eastern Oregon seek -
lng recruits. He attributes the reartv
enlisting of the valley town men to
the fact that good live companies
have been thriving there for years
and great interest has always been
taken by these companies in military
drill. One company at Salem came
up to the full quota of men without
recruiting.
Of all the soldiers now enlisted,
Portland has furnished about two
thirds. Portland firms are allowing
employes who have enlisted, all the
way from full pay to half pay while
they are in the army.
The National Guard men will not
be retained to active duty any longer
than absolutely necessary, is the opi
nion of Major Welch' However, he
believes the assembling of the Guard
troops at this time is a very good

HARVEST IS Of! IN FULL SK IN
THE IE COUNTRY -MAKING DIG YIELD
This end of the county has little
to offer in the line of news at present.
Nothing doing in that line as every
fellow Is busy, at least every fellow
that can be induced to get busy in
the fields, taking care of the big liar -
vest. Cutting is now quite general
and another week will see all the
headers in the fields. Some few are
threshing, and one or two combines
have begun on the fall brain. A
mong these we mention Chas. Devin
who has been combining for several
days past, and Is getting around
twenty bushels to the acre, and his
grain gets better as he works into
the field. Heading and threshing
Is going on at a rapid rate in the big
barley fields on the Baker place. Mat
Halvorsen Is dbing the work and this
grain is turning out 30 bushels.
There is seven hundred acres and we
understand the crop has already been
sold at a good figure and will be put
through the warehouse at lone just
as fast as is can be brought in. Paul
Reltmnnn has also been threshing
barley and is getting around thirty
bushels. He will also have an ex
cellent crop of wheat and oats. L.
J. Padberg is doing some threshing of
barley, also and Is getting twenty- five
bushels at present and this will im
prove as he gets into the fields a lit
tle farther. His brother, W. H. is do
ing the work with (lis gasoline outfit.
Mr. Padberg states that so far pro
gress has been rather slow owing to
the grain hardly ripe enough. The
straw Is tough and this makes it hard
to thresh. However, these days of
warmer weather are maturing all
grain better and by the time lie gets
to his wheat he anticipates no trou
ble. Mr. Padberg has eleven hun
dred acres of grain to put In the sack.
Messrs. Kindt and Jacquat who are
the owners of the Bowerman ranch
just over the line in Gilliam County,
are getting lined out to begin com
bining on 900 acres of grain by the
first of the week. They will propel
their machine with a 60-horse cater
pillar engine and are expecting a 20
bushel crop. John Williams and F.
H. Wilson will each begin the coming
week, and as stated above harvesting
will be general throughout the lone
section by the middle of the coming
week. 1

Live in Heppner.
Wyatt, age 24 years, and Theodore,
17 years, sons of Mr. and Mrs. John
Putman of Fossil, were drowned in
the John Day river, 22 miles from
Fossil last Sunday afternoon.
The older boy was teaching the
younger brother how to swim, and in
his fright, the younger boy clung to
Wyatt in such a manner that both
boys went down. The older boy
finally became so weak in his efforts
to save Theodore from the swift cur
rent that both went down before fel
low bathers could save them. A
third boy, Harold Owens got hold of
them once, but was taken to the bot
tom before he could free himself.
He barely saved his own life.
The young men went to Fossil Sun
day morning with a party of about 30
young men and women in autos, The
bodies were recovered by the use of a
hay rake, which combed the bottom
of the river.
The funeral was held in Fossil,
Tuesday morning at ten o'clock. The
hoys were nephews of Mrs. W. P.
fjrivner of this city.
Their cousin Clarence Scrivner and
wife accompanied by Mrs. Emma Cur

al theories are advanced for the rapid

forest service has eliminated the for

good chance to increase. Others say
that it is because there is no water
in the Humboldt ditch this year and
they are coming to the creek for a
drink while others say it Is a dead
sure sign of a hard summer. We
think that it Is because there are
no bootlegging goods here and the
rattlers are smart enough to know
that there is not anitidote enough in

Range conditions are excellent on
the west division of the Umatilla for
est, according to W. W. Cryder, head
of the Umatilla forestry office, who
returned last night from an extensive
tour of inspection of the territory.
Cryder says there is an abundance
of grass and lots of water this year
and the great number of sheep and
cattle which have been turned into
the forest for the summer should
have a great year.
The rabbles evidently has done a
good work for there are few coyotes
left after the ravages of the disease
this year. Forest rangers are find
ing the forests covered with dead
coyote bodies.
During Mr. Cryder's three week's
visit in the forests there was frost al
most every night and the days were
cool. The down timber is wet due
to the late season and there will he
little danger from forest fires for
some time.
Mr. Cryder has 600,000 acres of
forest under his supervision and 14
rangers. He made most of the jour
ney on foot.
The trip was made by way of
Heppner, Fossil, John Day and Spray.
"Everywhere in that section, said
Mr. Cryder, we heard much talk of
the Round-Up and the people are all
planning to come this year. The
residents too seem to think very fav
orable of the Pendleton normal
school and will support it."
The hay crop around Heppner is
bountiful and residents of Morrow
county say that the crops in general
are the best in the last ten years.
Cryder will leave I'oudleton next
week to visit the eastern slope of tht
forests. Pendleton East Oregonlan.
