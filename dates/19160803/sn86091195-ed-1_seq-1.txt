OFFICIAL PAPER OF BLACKFOOT CITY AND BINGHAM CO., IDA.
VOL. IX. NO. 36
BLACKFOOT. BINGHAM COUNTY, IDAHO. THURSDAY. AUGUST 3. 1916
$2.00 PER YE/ R
CARPENTERS
FORM UNION
The first labor union that was ever
formed in Blackfoot was the Carpen
ters' Union, whieh was organized July
17, 1916, with the following officers:
M. H. Shirley, president.
Henry Spani, secretary.
8. A. Ward, treasurer.
Leo Faulkner, recording secretary.
There were iortv-two charter mem
bers, all local men but six. The initia
tion fee of $2.00 will be increased to
$10.00 after tomorrow.
Before the carpenters unionized they
were getting 50 cents an hour for a
9-hour day. Now they are demanding
62 V 2 cents per hour and an 8-hour day.
August first was the day for the new
scale of prices and hours to be enforced,
and when the demand was made Tues
day morning on the contractors of the
Ecdes hotel and refused all the car
penters quit work. In sympathy
with the carpenters' demand for a
shorter day and better pay all the la
borers also struck, and it is reported
by leading members of the carpenters'
union that the bricklayers will also re
fuse to work on the job until the de
mands of the carpenters are granted.
All union carpenters employed on
other jobs were also refused the union
demands and quit their jobs.
All the employing carpetners are op
posed to the union 's demands but D. A.
Jenkins, who is credited with always
paying the union's present scale of
prices. Marcus Meister says he will pay
the scale if other contractors do.
The local manager of the Eeeles In
vestment Company, which is building
the new hotel, stated to us that there
was no strike on the construction of
the new hostelry, but that the men were
laid off on account of a dearth of
building material.
There seems to be considerable oppo
sition to the carpenters' union and its
demands from some of our leading and
substantial business men and probably
builders on the ground that Blackfoot
is too small for unions and their inevit
able strikes which always retard the
growth of small cities by driving capital
away and discouraging home building
We have been reliably informed that
a number of union carpenters were put
to work this morning at the Anderson
lumber yard, and more expect to go to
work on the Eeeles hotel as soou as
material arrives.
George D. Butler of Cambridge, Neb.
has arrived in Blackfoot where he is
now installed as druggist in the Powers
pharmacy.

ANOTHER AUTO ACCIDENT
Last night about midnight as Platt
Williams and D. D. Burnside were re
turning from Heise Springs in an auto
they met with a very strenuous acci
dent north of the city in the vicinity
of the sugar factory.
Thev must have been blinded bv the
headlight of the Yellowstone midnight
train and got off the road and into a
ditch where their auto was capsized
and its inmates severely bruised. One of
the occupants had several ribs broken,
and the other received a few scalp
wounds which were dressed at the local
hospital.
The -iar fared worse than its occ-u
pants and is badly damaged.
TO COMPLETE PAVING SEPT. 1
Mr. Hartung, superintendent of the
Maguire Paving Company, appeared be
fore the city council last Tuesday night
and stated that the paving was mater
ially delayed by the railroad company
not delivering the rock from their quar
ry at Arco. He stated that Superintend
ent Pierce informed him that he would
put on a daily train to haul the rock
and if he did* so the paving would be
finished September 1st. If not he would
have to ask for an extension of time
to complete the work, a request which
the council seemed willing to give under I
. i___ 1
the circumstances.
HARDWARE BUILDING
WORK ADVANCING
The new Boyle Hardware Company
wholesale warehouse on South First ave
nue is now nearing completion. Practic
ally all outside construction work is
completed and it is expected that the

to-date in this section,—Pocatello Tri
bune.

has already commenced the removal of
their whole stock to Pocatello, where

manager of what is. destined to be the
leading wholesale hardware business in

COLORED BOOTLEGGER IN BAD

sant bootlegger, yesterday appeared be
fore Judge Cowen with a plea of guilty
and was sentenced to the county jail
for 105 days on account of not having

City Council Pays Out
$12,846.07 on Paving
The city council held a regular meet-1
ing last Tuesday night with a quorum
present and Mayor Peck presiding. |
The minutes of the previous meeting
were read and approved. |
Mr. Pierce, superintendent of the
Utah-Montana division, appeared be-1
fore the council in company with the 1
road's engineer, and protested against i
the attempt of the council to force |
them to place sidewalks in front of
their right-of-way without their desire ,
to do so. He stated and convinced the
council that the proposed sidewalk was
absolutely valueless to his company, and
more of a detriment than a benefit to
the city, and they eliminated from the
sidewaik ordinance that portion which
was objectionable to the railroad com
pany. On request of the council he
promised to park the street between
the curbing and right-of-way and to
make the latter level and beautiful. He
also promised to build a sidewalk on
the south side of Bridge street where
it crosses Main. Also to sidewalk the
north side of Judicial on Main.
