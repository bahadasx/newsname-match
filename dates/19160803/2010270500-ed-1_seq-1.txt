Sioux City Journal, 2G: The little
town of Hubbard, Neb., has been
upset by mysterious gun attacks on
the home of John Sullivan, a wealthy
farmer near there, which culminated
in the alleged shooting of one of a
gang of four "gunmen" by Albert
Mnllin, Mr. Sullivan's farm hand,
but now it may return to its peace
ful way. The deep mystery, in
which many sensational incidents
took place, has been solved. Albert
Mullin. hero of the young men nnd
young women of Hubbard because)
he put to route the gunmen" gang,
is the "double dyed" deceiver. Mul
lin yesterday confessed to A. J.
Nuss, manager of a detective agency,
that he concocted the story of the
"gunmen" attack and that ho fired
the shots at the home of Mr. Sulli
van, who is his uncle. Mullin's con
fession, which he signed, was turned
over to Mr. suuivan. it is probable
that Mullin will not be prosecuted
because of his kinship to the Sulli
vans. The stories framed up by
Mullin, according to his signed state
ments, were weird. He posed as
the hero in all his pseudo adventures.
Residents of Hubbard, and particu
larly the Sullivans, were greatly
wrought up by the attacks on , their
home. Several times the house was
struck by bullets. Occupants heard
the bullets whiz by. Here is the so
lution to the mystery, a3 told by
Mullin in his confession. "I
shot at the (Sullivan) house a num
ber of times I do not know the ex
act number of times. I shot for the
purpose of making Mr. and Mrs.
Sullivan believe that they were be
ing molested by other parties."
Here's another story concocted by
young Mullin, which proved the
"deepest" mystery of all. It is here
told in his own words: "On or
about the Fourth of July, about 9
o'clock in the evening, I hid in a pit
about 80 feet west of the granary,
and while hiding there I saw four
men approach the cultivator which
was standing in the field; the four
men began to strip the parts off the
machine, and 1 opened lire on tnem
with my revolver, firing at and hit
ting one man twice, who fell to the
ground. He was picked up by his
companions and was taken to the
place where they had the horses tied
and was taken away on one of the
horses. In going away they drop
ped a niece of blood stained cloth
which had covered the wound in
flicted by me. I showed the blood
stained cloth to Mr. and Mrs. Sulli
van. I now state that the piece of
blood stained cloth which I showed
to them (the Sullivans) was taken
from the sore foot of one of the
horseB on the farm. The horse's
name .was Kate." Mullin, accord
ing to his sighed statement, strip
ped Mr. Sullivan's farm machinery
of different parts and told his em
ployer that they had been stolen.
Sioux City Journal. 28: Miss Mary
Duj?gan and Miss Helen Duggan, of
Goodwin, Neb., with their gueat,
Miss Mary Moriarity, of Woonsock-
ct, K. I., returned to their home
yesterday after being 'entertained
by their Sioux City friends for sev
eral days. . . .Among the Sioux City
ans who are spending the week at
Crystal lake are Mr. and Mrs. E. B.
Jones, Mr. and Mrs. B. D. Wells,
Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Knight, Mr.
and Mrs..G. L. Warsing, Miss Anna
Coughlin, Mis3 Gladys Coughlin,
Miss Grace Langfeldt, Miss Mabel
Barclay and Miss Helen Herbst.
Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Brvant. of Bov-
den, la., are with the party. . . .The
Uienhart Hats, Seventh and Nebras
ka streets, have been purchased
from Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Rico, of
Chicago, and James M. King, of Ho
mer, Ncb., nnd Samuel J. Knox, of
Wnterbury, Neb. The purchase
price was $80,000. Record of' the
sale was filed yesterday at the office
of the county recorder. The deal
was made through the real estate
firm of H. L. Cravens & Co. Mort
gages on Sioux City realty totaling
$40,000 were part of the considera
tion. Mr. Cravens stated that the
property had been bought for in
vestment purposes... Rumors, start
ing from no authoritive source, and
yet which have been persistent in
the city for several days to tho ef
fect that the waters of Crystal lako
were "poisonous," yesterday
brought forth a denial signed by the
cottagers of the lake. There were
several hundred names on the testi
mo"' I, Among them were thoso of
so. in f Sioux City's most widely
knoxii ioctors. It is estimated that
nearly 1,500 people are living at the
lake this year, and from 2,000 to
4,000 persons go to the lake each
Sunday. The starting point of the
rumor could not be determined.
The cottagers attested that they go
bathing in tho lake every day, and
have suffered no ill effects as the re
sult. Joe Marshall, who is interest
ed in the Crystal Lake Park company,
said some people have been poisoned
in this way: Instead of going to a
bath house they back their automo
biles into the woods and change their
clothes, resulting in some instances
in cases of poison ivy. The state
ment signed by the "cottagers"
reads: "We, the undrsigned cot
tagers and residents of Crystal lake,
believing that a great injustice is
being done by the circulation of
false reports regarding the purity of
the water in Crystal lake, desire it
to be known that we use this lake
for daily bathing for ourselves and
families, and with no ill effects, and
we know that the water is pure.
We believe tho said false reports
were circulated by parties with ma
licious intent, and as this lake has
become a popular summer rosort and
ia attracting thousands' of people, it
is only just that we express our
sentiments."
Lutheran Church Notes
DAKOTA CITY-SALEM
"The abundance of life consisteth
not in the abundance of what a man
possesseth." This is what most peo
ple will subscribe but it is what
many do not comprehend. How
men do wrestle with the world to
wring from it what they can. As if
happiness and riches of One sort or
another were synonomous, or even
went hand in hand. Abundance of
life is a condition rather than things
possessed. The man who has little
may live as loyaly as ho who has
much. Indeed we have all known
some who would pass out of the
world and never be missed, possibly
men rejoiced at their passing tho

Dakota City,
they were possessed of much, while
others leave a distinct void when
they have left tho they needed no
Will to distribute their riches, for
they took all their wealth with them
tho love of tfio community, tho
memory of kindness, the oft times
unrequited service, tho downright
self denial. Such a one has lived an
abundant life, ono of wide in
fluence and deep friendship.
Then, how many things thero nre
to thrill you over life. Get off the
farm to the city for a while, then
come back to old Dobin and the dog,
and your spring plowing nnd you
will know what wo mean. Just real
joy over tho commonplaces of life.
Vou do not need many possessions
to experience that. Your posses
sions could not buy them. A rich
man may have a fine cane, and an
elegant coat, but hardly "life"
enough to smile. His heart may be
heavy and lifeless, even sordid.
That is not life abundant, it is pov
erty, squalor of life, misery. Choose
a cot, a mind to work, and strength
rather than such. Choose a life, that
tingles at a kind word spoken, a spir
it that leaps in you because you are
serving, a soul that sees the bright
side of lowly things. That is a full
life, and abundance.
We once heard an old man say,
"Who wants to sleep his life away,"
and from his conversation we judged
he wanted more waking hours for
revelry. But how poor are the
pleasures which pass in an hour and
leave depression in their wake com
pared to the beauty of right. Right
eousness exnlteth, even in tho eyes
of the debased. How long have you
rejoiced after you had "stung" a
friend or how many times have you
been really sorry that you helped
him. That is the abundance of life.
When your soul is stirred and the
spirit is thrilled with the good, that
is abundant life. Money could "hot
buy it, you would't sell it. A poor
man can have it as well as the rich,
and much easier. And the power
of it all is Jesus Christ. A non
christinn truly may know something
of it, but tho fullness of such abun
dance is in the lovd of the Master.
The Emmanuel Ladies' Aid will
have a picnic Wednesd.n, as this
goes ta press, at Crysta. .uko.
Our Salem Sunday school was well
attended last Sunday as was tho
church service. Remember wo will
have the commmunlon next Sunday.
Wo will not bo disappointed.
We rejoiced to receive four into
the church at Salem last Sunday.
Two by confirmation, one by adult
baptism and one by Infant baptism. .
