The hanging was witnessed only by

LONDON. Aug. 3.—The fourth Ger
man air raid on British east counties
occurred early today and like previ
ous excursions of like character, re
sulted in little damage, according to
first official reports.
Six or seven Zeppelins formed the
SQuadron. They dropped "a consider
able number" of bombs, according to
the war office statement, but exact
reports of any damage have not yet
been received. It is reported one of
the raiders was hit and badly dam
aged by anti-air craft gunc.
British patrols sighted the Zeppe
lins very coon after they reached
points over British soil and anti-air
craft guns opened at once. The dirig
ibles flew at heights of from 3,000 to
5,000 feet.
In the -fourth air raid Is less than
seven days, British patrols wer$ able
to sight the aerial invaders before
they passed over British soil. Warn
ings were sent broadcast over all the
east coast counties long before the
dirigibles appeared over head.
"The night's air raid damage was
astonishingly small," said a statement
from the war'office later- in. the, day.
"Nine horses were killed and three in
jured."
The official htatemeht said the
counties of Norfolk, Suffolk. Baser
and Kent were all visited by the air
raiders. At only one point did they
penetrate far inland. About eighty
bombs were dropped In all, at what
military object or objects was not ap

Hull was her home port. As the Brit

NEW YORK, Aug. 3— Americans

During the first five months of this

on the democratic ticket out of "sheer
gratitude," she says.
"The democrats gave the Kansas
women the franchise and I could not
do anything else than be a democrat
besides I don't believe in the tariff

Dr. Harding was born in Springfield,
Ohio, in 1859. Her girlhood was spent'
in LaFayette, Indiana. In -1882 she
was graduated from, the Hahneman
Medical college, Chicago and at once

"I have been a suffragette for fifty
nine years, my parents knew Susan B.

never married and I am thankful for
that, too. It is such a terrible risk.
While I have the name of being a
very brave woman. I was never brave
enough to take a cruise on the sea of

If Dr. Harding Is nominated, she

Likelihood That They
Will KnjftorM
I--***
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 3.—
Cheering every mention of a national
ticket and every denunciation of the
"delivery" of the progressive party
to Charles E. Hughes by the national
committee, the progressive national
conference got under way at noon to
day—one hour behind scheduled time.
Definite action and any statement
that may be made, probably will not
come until late this afternoon or to
night.
Upon the demand of a large major
ity of the delegates, the meeting was
open to all comers. Since nearly ev
ery delegate had a message to de
liver, the session promised to be
prolonged.
The three way split that divides
the remaining progressive party
leaders was emphasized today before
the delegates met.
Three programs were represnted
by the delegates. They were:
To let the national ticket go by de
fault and not hold another national
convention this year, but to call a
party conference to be held soon
after the election and start an ag
gressive four year fight for 1920.
To endorse the candidacy of Presi
dent Wilson.
To order a national convention and
begin the best fight possible against
both old parties.
"There are only two possibilities
for this conference to decide: Shall
we have a national ticket or shall we
not?" said John M. Parker, the con
president,
"There is no "possibility that we
shall endorse Wilson or Hughes," he
continued. Parker said he believed
there would not be a national ticket,
because the party had no suitable
man to head it. He said he would re
fuse the nomination for president if
it was offered to him.
"If Wilson sees his opportunity, he
will get a shot gun and go after
Kitchin and Hoke Smith, who are op
posing his child labor bill, Parker
said. "He should tell these two lead
ers that they aren't lit to be In con
gress. It is my shame that the
southerners are the only ones oppos
ing this legislation."
As the conference convened, John
M. Parker, the vice -presidential can
didate, made known for the first time,
his plan for the party.
"My plan," he said in an interview
"is to concentrate the progressive
fight on a few states where there is
the best chance to. elect presidential
electors. We would not have a presi
dential candidate, and so these elec
itors could swing to the candidate
'ready to make the most concessions
to progressives. If neither side con
ceded enough and if we held the bal
ance of power in the electoral college,
we could then swing the election of
president into the house of represen
tatives."

Deutschlarid Ducked Under

After Bidding
Goodbye.
NO THRILLING CHASE
Departure of the German Undersea
Merchantman, Was Simple as
Falling Off a
Log.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
NORFOLK, Va., August" 3.—Some
where in the direction of Germany,
safely past the allied warship patrol,
the submarine marchantman Deutsch
land is boring her way through the
Atlantic toward her home port of Bre
men. Reports coming into Hampton
Roads indicate the pioneer submarine
blockade runner has not poked her
periscope above the water since she
submerged near the capes last night.
At that time the nearest British war
ship was five miles distant, according
to the tug Thomas F. Timmins, which
accompanied the Deutschland as far
as the capes.
Expectation of a thrilling chase and
perhaps some sort of a fight in connec*
tion with the Deutschland departure,
was disappointed. Folks on shore saw
nothing and sightseers who filled big
and little harbor craft saw little more.
In the dark of the night the Deutsch
land slipped out to the boundary edge
of the United States territorial wa
ters and ducked under and disappear
ed. That was all.
Captain Hinsch said the Deutsch
land planned to submerge only during
the day time when well out to sea and
in the night time only when abso
lutely necessary.
"She will proceed on the surface
like any other vessel at night as soon
as out of the danger zone," he said.
"We expect to hear from her—or
about her—before she reaches Bre
men."
From Cape Henry came the word
long after sunrise that nb sign had
been seen of the Deutschland. A
single disappointed British dog of war
lay off Cape Henry light and not an
other vessel was in sight.
Weather conditions favor the allied
patrol, however, and not the Deutsch
land. The cape observer reports a
clear sky and only a slight breeze.
The submarine's actual submersion
was witnessed only by h?r pilot tug,
the Timmins, and those aboard the
Timmins were not close enough to
be sure they had seen the dive made
until wave after wave of the heavy
sea had come up and gone down
without the submarine's light again
showing.
The submersion was made about a
mile outside the capes, the Timmins
crew reported when they put into
Norfolk early today.
Captain Hinsch of the interned Ger
man liner Neckar, who was aboard
the Timmins, said the lust act of
Captain Koenig and his crew before
they went below was to give three
cheers for America and the Ameri
can people. This was as they neared
the capes. Then all disappeared from

CONFERENCE IS CALLED
Nation Wide Tie up of Transportation
Will Rescult If the

[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.—A prob
lem, "tremendously dangerous in
ibotfa Its economic and political as
pects," faces (President Wilson 1
the threatened strike of 400,000 rail
road trainmen, according to admin
istration officials today.
The matter Is now directly before
the president In the form of a letter
from Chairman Harry A. Wtheelar, of
the railway committee of the United
States chamber of commerce. The
letter urges an inquiry on behalf of
the administration to investigate the
Impending crisis. Scores of informal
requests for action also have been
received.
However until the trainmen's strike
vote is counted—expected August 7—
the president probably will .decide no
course of action.
From an economic standipolnt, the
strike, If called, would assume cat
aclysmic proportions in the belief of
officials here. It would completely
tie up freight traffic throughout the
country, halting grain shipments,
food and supplies of all kinds to- an
extent and with results impossible to
forecast.
The smaller towns would suffer
most it is believed—(particularly those
wlho are not self supporting or with
in a territory supplying food. Min
ing towns, where supplies for only
two or three days are kept, would be
In immediate danger of starvation or
complete business collapse &s Its
people left for other -points. Losses
according to government officials
would mount Into hundreds of mil
lions of dollars.
From a political standpoint, "the
president's position in attempting to
bring about an adjustment of the dif
ficulty is "full of dynamite," accord
ing to his advisors.
•President Wilson today requested a
conference with Commission Cham
bers of the United States board of
mediation and concilation, presum
ably to discuss the threatened strike
of the big four brotherhoods of rail
way men which would cause a na
tion-wide tie up of transportation.
The trainmen say they won't arbi
trat and the railroads say they won't
yield.- Should the president, by shirt
I sleeve diplomacy, demand arbitration,
I he would face resentment of several
hundred thousand laboring men.
If he fails to bring about arbitra
tion or a settlement, he will find him
self faced by a paralyzed transporta
tion system resulting in tremendous
business confusion and vast suffer
ing.
Hence, friends of the president are

WOMEN WILL SUPPORT
HUGHES FOR PRESIDENT
Contribution of $100,000 is to

Republicans.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 3.—One hun
dred thousand dollars and the in
fluence of the national woman's
party will be cast into the balance in
favor of Chas. E. Hughes and against
President Wilson, if the democrats
fail to pass a suffrage amendment at
the present session of congress. Miss
Martin, of the woman's party, stated
to the United Press today:
"We must judge the democratic
party on its performance and the re
publican party on its promises. Just
as we hold President Wilson to a
strict accountability for his suffrage
record, so we will hold Governor
Hughes to his promise of national
suffrage if he is elected.
"The leaders of the woman's party
are no babes in the woods. We real
ize that politics and hope of victory
may have had a great deal to do
with the change in Governor Hughes
toward favoring national suffrage.
But we have not even a promise from
the democrats.
"We have every confidence that as
leader of his party. Governor Hughe3
will keep his word. The party that
secures the political freedom of all
Fares to Illinois points are prejudi
cial to Keokuk to the extent that they
exceed the fares from points opposite

Chicago where the distances are prac

held to impose an unlawful burden on
interstate commerce.
The carriers are ordered to remove
the discriminations.

Pennsylvania and Southeastern oil at

land.
women will inevitably win the undy
ing loyalty and adiherence of tha
women voters. Will the democrats
give this great opportunity to the re
publican party?"
Miss Martin is directing efforts to
raise $100,000 campaign fund for tha
woman's party. Anticipating no sat
isfactory action from the democrats,
Miss Martin stated that plans have
been practically completed for a
vigorous campaign by the woman's
party in the twelve suffrage states in
favor of the republican party.
"I myself am a democrat," said
Miss Martin. "I would like to vote for
President Wilson. But as a member
of the woman's party my first inter
est is to secure national woman suf
frage."
Two organizers of the woman's
party and of the congressional union
for woman suffrage havo actually
been at work for months in each of
the equal suffrage states. One is in
charge of state headquarters and
works in co-operation with the state
and congressional district chairmen.
The second organizer travels around
the state and arranges meetings for
a corps of speakers routed from na
tional headquarters in Chicago.
Miss 'Martin expects the conference
of tihe woman's party in Colorado
Springs August 10-12 formally to de
