vote against the amendment is con

out ti; every section of the state, re

Need to Hurry.
MAY ACCEPT, MAY NOT
Any Consideration of Tntcr
nal Affairs Must Conv
From Mexico.
WASHlNfrTO.V. Aug. 2. Official
of the de facto government of
Mexieo have been favorably im
pressed, according to information
reaching the state department today,
by Acting Secretary Polk's note ac
cepting the suggestion for a Joint in
ternational commission to consider
border problems, but. no definite in
dication has eomo as to when General
Carranza's reply may be expectod.
At the Mexican embassy it was said
the repdy might be received tomorrow,
although officials would not disclose
on what information the statement
ivas based.
At neither the state department nor
the embassy would any official pre
dict what position the do facto au
thorities would tako in regard to the
American proposal that tho commis
sion be authorized to diHcuss other
matters than tho military situation on
the border. It was made clear by
administration officials, however, that
the suggestion did not contemplate
discussion of acquisition of territory,
of claims of one government ngainst
the other arising- out of the losses suf
fered by Americans In Mexico, on the
one hand, or damage resulting from
the occupation of Mexican territory
by American troops on the ether; or
the processes which brought the de
facto government into power.
Kxvly Ileport IHvdrcd.
Great Htross was laid on the fact
that a speedy report was desired from
the commission by both governments.
This alore. It was said, would pre
vent any discussion of financial claims
or consideration of tho dispute over
a small strip of land In tho H! Paso
region which has recurred ot various
Intervals for many years. So far as
the status; of the Carranza government
goes, it was added, the Cnlted States
has extended recognition to It and
can not go behind hat act.
Officials would not say what mat
ters in addition to the military situ
ation It was desired that tho enmmis
slor.ers take up. Any consideration
of thn Internal affairs of Mexico, It
was said, must arise on motion of tho
Mexican government Itself. If the
economic and flnanch.l situation of
the southern republic were deemed by
the Mexican commissioners to be
material! to discussion at any point,
tho American members doubtless
would be instructed to undertake 1L
The possibility thit from such a dis
cission might be developed a plan
under which American bankers enjld
go to the aid of the de facto govern
ment. It was pointed out, vould rest
wholly upon the initiative of the Mex
icans. Private advice today from Mexico
Indicated that new problems are
pressing on Oeneral Carranza with the
'pread of Jabor trouble. No details
were given, but It was reported that
dlrcontent was spreading among
Mexican railroad employes nrd that

LiMOX, Aug. 2. 1 10:47 p. in.)
Sir Roger Casement vill lie
executed In the l'.entom I lie prison
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning for
high treason. Iird Robert Cecil,
minister of war trade, today made
known to the Associated Press that
It was the Itritish government's de
termination not to reprlcvo f'ir
Roger.
While tho government maintains
silence as to the final efforts made
on behalf of Sir Roger, it is known
that petitions were received as late
as today. The foreign ofVife says no
communication has been made from
the state department at Washington
requesting a reprieve.
The whole subject surrounding Sir
Rtger's case has boen seriously con
sidered by the cabinet and the deter
mination to let the law take its course
proved unalterable. The decision of
the government will cause some sur
pri.se as the opinion had become w ide
spread that the sentence of Sir Rogr
would be commuted at the last
moment to life imprisonment.
Kxpluins Stand.
In explanation ot the government's
refusal to reprieve Roger Casement,
Lord Robert Cecil, parliamentary un
der the secretary for foreign affairs,
flnd minister of war trade gave to
the Associated Press the following
ktateiuent:
So Joubt Mr. Casement's guilt ex-
ir.ts.
io one doubts that the court
nnd jury arrived at the right verdict.
The only ground for a roprieve would
be political expediency, a difficult
ground to put forward in that this
country nover could strain the law to
punish a man for the same reason
that it could not strain the law to let
one off.
"The Irish rebellion began with the
murder of unarmed people, both
soldiers and police. No grievance
Justified it and it was purely a poli
tical movement organized by a small
section of Irish people who mill hate
Kngland and who were assisted by
Germany.
"There was and is in this country,
the greatest possinie indignation
against these people. There is no
doubt that Casement did everything
possible to assist this rebellion in co
operation with the Germans. There
can be no doubt that he wu moved
by enmity for this country. I
Revolt Ills Purpose.
"The contention that he landed in
Ire Land tor the purpose of preventing
the rebellion is demonstrably fa'sc. No
such asuortion was made by counsel ut
tlit trial.
"Casement was much more malig
nant and hotile to this country than
were the leaders of the rising who
were caught with arms in their hands.
He visited military prisoners In Ger
many with the Intention of persuading
Irish soluicrs to throw off their al
legiance. All sorts of promises were
made for the improvement of the
conditions of these men to induce
t lie in to Join the Irish legion. An
enormous majority tlnis approached
refused and thereafter were subjected
to increased hardships by the Ger
mans. "I-Yoin among these Irish soldiers
a number since have been repatriated
as helpless Invalids and they subse
quently died. They look upon Caic
mept as their murderer.
"Nor is there any ground, public or
private, so far as wi know which can !
be quoted In mitigation of Casement's
crime and 1 do not think any govern
ment doing Its duty could Interfcro
with the sentence which has been
paesed on him."
Gavin Ouffey, counsH for the for
mer knight, is renponHible for the
ptiitcmcnt tha. tho condemned man
baa embraced the Catholic religion
sine passing of the death sentence,
having received instriK lions and
dally ministrations from a priest vls
itirg his cell.
Mr. Ouffey declared also that the
pr'soner had now seen and bade fare
well to his nearest relatives. who
catled and spent some time with him
at the jail. The doomed man l re
ported as unusually cheerful, bearing
himself as ono unconcerned.
The. execution is et for ! o'clock

The Tinirnins' message was picked

While the Sterett s report did not
mention the Heutschland by name,
navy officials had no doubt that the
reference was to her. Tho Sterett,
with three other destroyers und the

was pointed out, were doing neutrality

WASHINGTON, Aug. ..-.officials
of the federal government,
iu luding President W ilson, are
loscly watching developments in the
' ontrover; y between J " railway ss
tems and their four hundred thou
sand employes and are preparing to
offer every possible aid in cl'fisting
an agreement and avoid a strike.
Today the president forwarded to
the labor depart mint an appeal he
ha 1 received from the chamber of
commerce of the United States
Oiroogh Harry A. Wheeler, chairman
of the chamber's committee on rail
roads, declaring a strike, is Inevitable
"unless some strong measures of In
tervention are Hpucdily Introduced"
and urging an inqurly. Acting Sec
retary of l-ilHir Post said tonight h
was In close touch with the situation,
but had not decided whether action
by the department would he neces
sary. Tho federal board of mediation
and conciliation, which is authorized
by law to attempt to avert strikes on
railroads, also is keeping watch on de
velopments, and its officials expect to
be called on as soon its the strike
vote, now being counted, has been
completely canvassed. They said to
night that nothing could be done at
present.
Copies Forwarded.
Copies of the chamber's appeal to
President Wilson were forwarded to
chairmen of the congressional com.
nierce committees and to representa
tives of the railroads and the em.
ployes. Tho chambir Is considering
culling a conference here to impress
congress with the advisability of im
mediate action.
Mr Wheeler said ho had recently
atended a meeting of representatives
of the employers and employes in
New York, and that as a result his
oonvlnction was depended that an
amicable settlement was remote. "1
am assured," be added, "there will be
no modification of the attitude of the
roads. Neither is it expected that the
rc prescntatives of the men with the
new power of the strike voto in their
hands, will recede from the position
which they have taken heretofore.
"The United States board of media
tion and conciliation may come into
the matter at this point, but without
effect. In my Judgment, in bringing
these contending factions together.
Finally arbitration may be discussed
?nd tho break will come when the
roads absolutely refuse to urbitratc
the demands of the men and the men
refuse with equal force to admit into
the arbitrations the contingent pro
posals of the roads.

"I must confess In this sil nation,
after taUing most earnestly with
loth parties to the controvert-y, that
I see no ray of light nor any possi
I llity of averting a serious catas
trophe." In a message to the bends of the
railroad brotherhoods, Mr. Wheeler
said he hoped he was wrong in bis
view of tho gravity of the situation,
imt that "tho public Interest is a defi
rite and tangible third Interest in the
controversy and the public ha.s a right

would fight the resolution adopted
yesterday by the hoard of commis

There was another explosion scare
among Jersey 1'ilv officials late to

of sui;ar stored in five warehouses
was reported spreading lo two freight
ears loaded with high explosives. The
ears had been buried under debris
and could not be removed to a place
of safety.
Tho blaze, while serious, was gotten
under control.
Tho rlre and water poured on the
fire have turned thousands of tons
of tho sugar into n syrup that spread
over much of the island.
Shrapnel shells in the piles of debris
were exploded by the intense heat In
such numbers that more than fifty
laborers working near the fire were
ordered away and a "dead line" was
established, under police supervision.
