S TAXPAYERS AVO!D RUSH.
Assistant Co:nnmissioner of Finance I
A.rthur J. O'Keefe, called attention (C
aSturday to the desirability of the iI
taxpaxerm` of the city realizing that if tt
the.. would avoid much in-,onvenienn iii
to themselves and relieve the city s1
treasurer's office force of needless ex-. t
tra labor, they \lill pay their real es- II
tate taxes early and not wait until the S:
time limit for pay them. Aug. 21. has i
almost expired, as was done last year. at
with the result that there was a rush If
at the last moment that seriously con- ft
rested the( work ot receivlng the in
taxes.
The period for the payment of the in
real estate taxes began on July '4 and -z
continues one month from that date. at
The largest slngle tax payment so far th
made was that of the .Morgan's Lou- dt
Islana and Texas Railroad Company, ci
amounting to $29.000. ri
