Blythe Files Exception to Ruling And
Case is Still Not Definitely Settled,
ItS
Overruling the petition of Z. Z.
Blythe. asking for a recount of the
tallots in West Hendeiaonville, Hoop
ers Creek, Clear Creek and Rugby
precincts, the Henderson county board
of elections Monday declared W. F.
Brown the nominee of the Republican
party for the office ofi Tax Collector
and Treasurer of Henderson county.
However, Mr. Blythe has filed excep
tions to the Ruling? and order of the'
board and the election muddle is still
not settled.
It will be j-emembered that in . the
second primary held Saturday, July 1,
W. F. Brewn and Z. Z. Blythe were,
rival candidates for the nomination for
tax collector and treasurer. The offi
cial count of the ballots showed Mr.
Brown to have a majority of four
Totes, but believing that therp were
irregularities in the election Mr.
Blythe immediately filed notice of con
test and a hearing was set for July 11.
This hearing, after much, .argument
was postponed until Monday of this
week, -when the board tok final ac
tion in the case ae far as they were
concerned.
At the hearing Tuesday as on form
er occasion Blythe was represented by,
Blythe, Rector and Valentine, and"
Brown's lawyers were Smith and
Shipman. The argument in. the case
took up the greater part of three
hours, the main point centering around
as to whether or not the board had
the right to go behind the official re
turns and recount the votes. This the
board ruled they had not the right to
do in the facef-bsolutefH-oOf thaHfor-the -judges arid fegistrarsTat "an
there were irregularities, and the dom
ination of Mr. Brown was declared.
The exceptions to the ruling of the
board, made by Mr. Blythe's attorneys
immediately after the decision was an
nounced, are in part as follows:
"The board erred in holding that it
could not. under the lawu go behind
the returns, hear evidence, and ascer
tain what number Of voters, if any,
voted illegally for the respondent, W.
F. Brown, in the primary election of
July 1, 1916.
"The board erred in holding, it had
no authority to investigate and ascer
tain, upon competent evidence, tbA
number of democrats who voted for
the respondents W. F. Brown, in said
primary.
"The board erred in not hearing evi
dence that petitioner proposed to offer

The third meeting of the adjourned

28th-30th. On account of the heavy

able, meeting was held. The subject

NOT A SINGLE CASE
OF TYPHOID FEVER HERE
Jn a statement issued by Dr. J.
Frank Cranford, city health officer, it
is stated that Hendersonville is now
entirely free from typhoid fever and
only two cases have been reported so
fai this year.
Doctor Cranford's statement is as
follows:
"The city of Hendersonville is en
tirely free from typhoid fever. There
j8 not a case in the city. There has
been so far this year two cases, neith
whi.ch had city water connection.
The city water was examined a fesr

"The board erred in holding that it

precinct was not held according to law

Mr. Blythe has reserved the right for
any further action he may wish to

of the republican party. The case
will probably be carried to the supe

FLORIDA PAPER SATS
HENDERSONVILLE O. K.
The recent disastrous flood that vis
ited the mountains adjacent , to Hen
dersonville very naturally gave rise
to many exaggerated reports. . . While
other places suffer great losses, and
almost irreparable damages it will be
of interest to the outside friends of the
visitors in Hendersonville to know
that city escaped the ravages of the
flood and maintains a normal in its af
fairs of business and social matters.
Lights and water were cut ofC for
twelve hours but those have been re
stored. Hendersonville is said to be
all right, and Florida people need not
fear about going there. Titusville,

losses, Mr. Carry writes in part as fol
lows: "I see a movement on foot in Rich
mond to assist in relieving your good
people, and I intended to send a check
to the Times-Dispatch, but it occurs
to me that if you have a local treasur
er, I will be glad to send my contrfbu
to your immediate locality. If you
think this advisable under the circum

favor of your local treasurer for $50
with a great deal of pleasure and sat

FATHER TELLS OF LOSS
OF WIFE AIJD CHILDREN
B. E. Huntley of Bat Cave, the man
who lost his wife and two adopted,
children when a landslide struck their
home on the night of July 15, was in
the city Monday for the first time since
the sad occurrence which deprived him
of his loved ones and the home he had
labored to build.
"My house was destroyed and wash-,
ed away on the night of July 15. be
tween the hours of one and two
o'clock' said Mr. Huntley. l heard
noises outside and thought it was the
water rising, but as I opened the door
I realized not a moment too soon that
it was a landslide, and before I could
give a warning to my wife and theitwo
children, the house had been carried
.'totally away, taking them with it. I
only escaped by a hair s breadth.
"Everything I had was swept away
and the damages to my property is
about $1,000. I am now staying with .
my brother, Jesse Huntley at Bear
Wallow."
The body of Mrs. Huntley was found,
on Sunday afternoon about a Quarter
of a mile from where the house stood,
and she was buried at Middle Fork
burial ground. She was 29 yaars of
age and before her marriage was Miss?
Belle Wilson of that neighborhood.
They had been married nine years.
- Not having children of their own,
Mr. and Mrs. Huntley had adopted the
boy and girl. They were Bonnie
aged 1. and Fred aged 11. The bodies
of the two y children were not found
until Saturday following the floojl. ,
They were found within a few steps
of each other a mile and half down
the river, and were buried m the burial
ground near Bat Cave.
The hpme-of the Huntley's was sit
uated on a mountainside and was
swept bv the slide into a small branch
