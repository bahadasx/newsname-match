U-BOAT PLAYING
HIDE AND SEEK
FAR OUT AT SEA
Deutsehland Submerges Mile
Off Capes and Is Unobserved
by Allied Warships
CHEERS FOR AMERICANS
Last Act of Crew Refore Going
Under; Will Pass Through
English Channel
By Associated Press
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 3.—Somewhere
out in the Atlantic to-day the German
merchant submarine Deutschland and
allied warships were believed to be
playing hide and seek as the undersea
boat sped homeward after passing out
the Virginia Capes last night.
The Deutschland submerged a mile
off the coast shortly before 9 o'clock
and so far as known here was un
observed by the allied warship patrol
guarding the canes against her escape.
One of the last acts of Captain
Koenig and his crew, according to
Captain Hinsch, of the tug Timmins,
which acted as her convoy from Balti
more to the capes, was to stand on
the deck of the submersible and give
three rousing cheers for America and
the American people.
The final dash was virtually without
incident. Eighteen miles up the Chesa
peake bay, at the crossing of the Old
Point and Cape Henry channels, the
submarine began to gather speed and
soon was hurrying toward the Atlantic.
Carried False Upper Works
As the Deutschland approached the
sea it was apparent she was carrying
false superstructure, sligntly lower
than hir conning tower. It was straw

General Strike on All Transit
Lines of New York Is Now
Regarded as Imminent
By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 3. A strike of
street railway employes tieing up every
surface line in Manhattan, the Bronx
and Queens county seemed inevitable
to-day. The leaders of the union re
cently organized and the employes to
day delivered an ultimatum to the
railway companies giving them until
to-morrow to grant their demands and
efforts to-day by Mayor Mitchel to
bring about arbitration failed.
Heads of the various traction com
panies are reported to be united in
a decision to refuse to grant the de
mands of leaders of the street railway
men's union for recognition and in
creased pay. The union organizers
are making every effort to extend
their organization and the railway of
ficials are preparing for a strike.
Their plan is said to be to bring
thousands of strike-breakers from
other cities.
The only hope held out to-day of
avoiding a strike on the many surface
lines operated by the New York Rail
ways Company within 4 8 hours was
the slender one that either the com
pany or the union men would yield.
Prior to the hour set for the meet
ing between representatives of the
traction companies and union heads
at Mayor Mitchell's office, William B.
Fitzgerald, general organizer of the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway Employes an
nounced that demands in behalf of
the employes of the New York Street
Railways Company and the New York
and Queens Railway Company would
be presented to the companies to-day
and that they would be given until
6 p. m. to-morrow to give their ans
wer. If unfavorable, a strike vote
among the employes would be taken,
he said.

New* York, Aug. 3.—Miss Kitty Marion, the famous English suffragist
who disappeared some time ago, has been found in a rooming house of this
city where she is serving as a dishwasher, having been reduced to this ex
tremity by failing to find other work.
Miss Marion came to New York from London at the beginning of the war.
She was a militant member of the Women's Political Union. Few women be
longing to that fighting organization had more strenuous experiences than she.
She was sent to Holloway jail 250 times for taking a leading part in the
women's fight tor political recognition. It was then she was forcibly fed
232 tinies. But. In New York she found it much harder to get food than
it was to dodge it in England.

OCTOGENARIAN TO
ADOPT TWO GIRLS
May Inherit Fortune Estimated
at $8,000,000 as Result
of Action
By Associated Press
Chicago, Aug. 3. Captain Edward
W. Morrison, an octogenarian, has ob
tained permission of the county court
to adopt two young girls who some
day may inherit the fortune once es
timated at $8,000,000 left by the cap
tain's father, James W. Morrison, who
died in 1868. The girls are Margaret
Anna Burnstein, aged 16, and Alice B.
Burnstein, aged 10, daughters of Jo
seph Burnstein, owner of a small
store.
Captain Morrison is 82 years old,
and resides with the girls, a caretaker
and a pair of watch dogs in a 70-year
old frame dwelling in the center of
the crowded West Side.
It is asserted that the elder Morri
son's will provided that the son should
have but a life estate in the property,
and that at his death, if he should
have no heirs, approximately $1,000,-
000 should go to certain collateral
heirs of James Morrison, and the re
mainder, some $7,000,000 should be
used in building a great public high
school in Chicago. The will was de
stroyed in the great fire of 1871, but a
copy has been established under court
decree.

HARRISBURG, PA., THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST 3, 1916.
GOVERNOR SAYS
"THE TELEGRAPH
BEAT ME TO IT"
Came Home to Endorse Ver
mont Tourist Plan and
Finds Work Done
HARRISBURG GREAT Hl'B
Ambitious to See Capital City
Center of State's Greatest
Road System
The Telegraph beat me to It," said
Governor Brumbaugh smilingly last
night as he read with interest the edi
torial suggesting that Pennsylvania
follow the example of Vermont by Is
suing special invitations to tourists to
visit this State.
"I am home fully meaning to urge
that very thing," re continued. "I have
been touring through the reg.on where
hospitality to the summer tourist, spon
taneous and delightful thought It be,
approaches a busness proposition, as it
ought to In Pennsylvania. I hope the
newspapers will so popularize this
movement that we too will have our
special Invitations.
"I assure you New England, with the
possible exception of the grandeur of
Mt. Washington has nothing to excel
the scenic beauties of Pennsylvania.
"Touring Taxleahn"
"They are going so far In Maine as
•o consider the establishment of a
system of touring automobiles for the
benefit o the visitor, cars to be rented
at $lO a day."
"A kind of touring taxicab," suggest
ed the reporter.
"That's it." agreed the Governor,
"touring taxicabs, and the same plan
ought to be worked out in Pennsylva
nia. both for those who live without
the State and for our own people as
well, for few of our people know as
much of Pennsylvania as they should."
Hnrrlshurg n Hub
Governor Brumbaugh has tome back
from his vacation more enthusiastic for
good roads than ever before, and more
determined than ever to make Harris
burg the hub of a great number of
State highways leading to all parts
of the Commonwealth.
"We must have that loan," he said.
"We cannot make permanent improve
ments out of current revenues and get
anywhere. What we need is a great
system of main highways and feeders,
with hard surfaces flt for use all the
y*ar. Spending money on dirt roads
"will get the State nowhere, but that's
all we can do under the circumstances,
NEAT HIIUHC*
"I believe," the Governor said, "that
In addition to these roads the State
should build and maintain a system of
rest houses at intervals of a hundred
miles or less all along the main high
ways. I would have a road patrolman
and his family live in each and a large
room in each set aside for the use of
the public, with conveniences attached
such as every motorist requires. Pos
sibly the wife of the patrolman would
be permitted to sell light refreshments.
This is a matter that we can take up
later."
City as nnnil Center
The Governor says he is more Im
pressed with Harrisburg as a road cen
ter every time he comes back from
[a trip. "You don't have to climb a
j mountain to get in or out of Harris
burg," he said, "and you can get to
any important center of the State
quickly from here. The railroads real-
I ized that much more quickly than the
j Commonwealth. That is shown by the
fact that you can take an express train
:any afternoon from Harrisburg to al
! most any part of the continent and go
! by a direct route."
No Trace of Bandits
Reported Across Border
Washington, Aug. 3. Major Gen
eral Funston repor'ed to-day that no
trace could be found of the band of
Mexican raiders reported yesterday
to have crossed into American terri
tory near Fort Hancock. His mes
sage follows:
"General Bell makes report that
commanding officer of cavalry sent to
Finlay last night state that he had
locality where 150 Mexicans were re
ported to have been seen, thoroughly
scouted and saw no signs of any raid
ers. General Bell is inclined to be
lieve that the report of presence of
Mexican bands is a mistake."
MAY NEVER TRY CHRIBTLEY
John Christley, 353 South Thir
teenth street, postal clerk, who shot
and killed his wife a montn ago, and
then put a bullet into his head, has
been removed from the Harrisburg
hospital to the county jail. Christley
is not yet strong enough for trial and
will not be formally charged with
murder for at least a week, if then.
The bullet is still in liis brain, and it
is feared an abscess will develop. It Is
the belief of physicians thai Christley
will be deprived of his mental
facilities and may never be in a con
dition to be tried.

London, Aug 3. Roger, Casement,
former British knight and consul, was
hanged at 9 o'clock this morning In
Pentonville jail for high treason. He
was convicted of conspiring to cause
an armed revolt in Ireland and with
having sought German aid to that end.
Two hours before the execution a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates.
Twenty minutes before Casement
mounted the scaffold the great prison
bell began to toll. The sound was
greeted with cheers from the crowd,
mingled with some groans. At . 9
o'clock the crowd had swollen to such
proportions that it extended for two
blocks from the prison front. At one
minute after 9 a single stroke of the
bell announced that the trap had been
sprung. It was the signal for a mock
ing. jeering yell from the crowd which
suddenly died away into dead silence.

Casement met his death with calm
