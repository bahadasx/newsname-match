NELSEN AND NAMSAY
FOR COMMISSIONERS
COUNTY has seldom had the opportunity to
vote for county commissioners of such substantial
types as Herman Nelsen in the South district and Claude
C Ramsay in the City district.
Both present a refreshing departure from the profes
sional politician, liach has been a success in private life,
Ramsay as a merchant and real estate man, and Nelsen
as a farmer. Nelsen never ran for or held office before
Ramsay's politics has been limited to one term in the leg
islature of t ( >o7.
Neither Ramsay or Nelsen has been induced to make
the race because of the salary of $2,000 a year attached
to the office. Kach has been making, and is capable of
making, considerably more than that in his own private
line of endeavor.
Rut it has been plainly evident for several years that
the affairs of the county have been entrusted to irrespon
sibles who have played political football with the public
funds.
The county commissioners spend as much, or more,
money than the city. They spend a million dollars a
year for roads aloni. Every penny comes out of the
people, by taxation.
To the average citizen, the county commission is of
tar more importance than many of the higher offices,
such as senator or representative. But, in the past, we
have been too far carried by the glamor of the high
office to give sufficient attention to the important offices.
As a result, the types of Hamilton, I.ou and Pete Smith,
and others bred in the school of ward politics, have been
spending the county's money with a reckless abandon
that has often shocked the community.
It will relieve the county from such irresponsibles if
Nelsen and Ramsay are elected. Neither has anv axe to
grind. Neither has political debts to pay. ROTH ARii

A PRICELESS GIFT,
BOUNCING BABY
BOY-GIVEN AWAY
Baby Donald Phillip*
By Cornelia GUm
THE STAR has a wonderful gift for sonic one—the most wonderful gift in the
world.
He, the gift, is a baby.
He came to live in the world just eighteen months ago, but there didn't seem
to be any home for him in the place where he choose to arrive, and he is looking for
the little white bed and the woolly white lamb that is meant for every baby that is
born.
He came into The Star office yesterday with a tiny little woman and a big
man, Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Bigelow, with whom he has lived since Dr. Francis Brown
found him when his little girl mother had to give him up. He sat enthroned on
Mr. Bigelow's knee, while the entire staff, from the managing editor to the office
boy, stood about and adored him.
He is soft and round, sturdily and perfectly formed—the sort of baby that
one's arms ache for.
His eyes are blue, bright blue—and his little round cheeks are apple red with
health.
The soft golden hair on his head curls a little—one loose ringlet on his fore
head and another on the back of the dimpled neck, and his smile flashes unceas
ingly.
Fvervthing about him breathes a beautiful healthiness, and he has a brave
little cordiality in meeting strangers that wins one completely.
When we offered him things to play with he accepted them gravely and said
"Thank you," very distinctly.
"Thank you" was the first thing he learned to say. Somehow that hurts when
one thinks of it. Most babies gurgle "Mamma" and "Daddy," but for little Donald
Phillips there was no need to say that, for there was no mother or dad to hear.
Whoever the lucky man and woman are for whom Donald is meant will have
all the exquisite joy of teaching him to call them the two names that will be dearer
than any others to him all of his life.
If any of you have a place in your homes and in your hearts for a son that
will be all yours; if you feel you can take him and give him the things a boy needs
to make him a man, let me hear from you.
W rite to me at once, in care of The Star. Tell me your phone number and a
little about the size of your families, their ages, and anything else you care to about
yourselves. I will call you up and answer any questions you may ask, and tell you
when you may meet Donald.
We of The Star are so taken up with him we want to be sure he finds just
the right home.
