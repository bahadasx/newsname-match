"I don't believe in banks," says old G. Rouch, "they
don't do me no good." Perhaps not but we would like to
see him run down to Washington to get his pension check
cashed or to New York or San Francisco when he is lucky
enough to receive a check on one of those places; Maybe
he'll sell a horse to a man in a neighboring town and re
ceive a check in payment. Did you ever stop to think
that if it were not for this bank you would have to be on
the road half the time going after money or taking money
some place? We make no charge for cashing your checks
