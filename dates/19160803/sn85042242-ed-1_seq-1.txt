helping with the job resulted in a pre­
mature explosion and the loss, of
three fingers.

APPARENT LACK OF
AVAILABLE CANDIDATES
Indianapolis, Aug. 2.-^Progressive
party leaders from a number of states
who disapprove of the action of the
party's national committee in endors
in Charles B. Hughes for president,
at its meeting in Chicago, June 2*6,
tolll'Meet here tomorrow to consider
the* advisability of re-assembling the
party's national convention within 30
days to nominate a candidate for pres­
ident.
John M. Parker, of Louisiana, vice
president of the convention, who is*
sued the call for the conference, ar­
rived tonight and conferred with Pro­
gressive leaders from other states,
but no definite plans have been
agreed upon for tomorrow's confer­
ence. ,-i
No Available Candidates.
A number of the Progressives here
favor nominating a candidate for pres­
ident, but admit the apparent lack of
available candidates. Victor Murdock,
of Kansas, apparently is the choice
of a majority for the place but he has
declined to make the race.
Bainbridge Colby, of (New York,
who nominated Col. Roosevelt at the
Progressive national convention in
June, is mentioned as a possible can­
didate, but his friends believe he will
decline to vun.
While the leaders are divided as to
the wisdom of baming a national tick­
et, they unite in protesting against
the endorsement of Hughes by the
Progressive national committee, and
favor acting to perpetuating the party
as a political national unit.
nOGBESSIIIES UE
TO KKEIMi
Fargo, IN. D., Aug. 2.—National
Committeeman O. L. Engen of the
Progressive party sent out a call for
a state conference here Aug. 10, the
day that Candidate Hughes is sche­
duled to speak here. The meeting
will decide whether or not the party
will put the state ticket in the field
or indorse the candidates of other
parties. Mr. Engen is of the belief a
ticket will be put up. The meeting
twill give Progressives a chance to
"•tie up" Hughes.

The'(president forwarded to the lab­
or department today an appeal receiv­
ed from the Chamber of Commerce of
the United States through Harry A.
Wheeler, chairman of the chamber's
committee on railroads, declaring a
strike is inevitable, "unless some
strong measures of intervention are
speedily introduced" and urging an
inquiry. Acting Secretary of Labor
Post said tonight he was in dtose
touch with the situation.
The Federal Board of Mediation and
Conciliation also is keeping watch of
developments. Its officials expect to
be called on as soon as the strike vote
"has been canvassed."
Copies of the chamber's appeal to
President Wilson were forwarded to
chairmen of the congressional com­
merce committees and to representa­
tives of the railroads and the em­
ployees. The chamber is considering
calling & conference here to impress
congress-with the advisability of im­
mediate action.
In anticipation of a general confer­
ence on the question, the chamber has
sent to all commercial bodies in the
country, copies of a letter to the pres­
ident, with a request that each send
a representative to such a meeting.

$212 00
Reports from other cities and
towns in the state indicate that Bis­
marck, with a fund already nearing
|300, is leading in the movement to
raise money for the purchase of a mo­
tor ambulance for the First North
Dakota Regiment.
It was first planned to buy the auto­
mobile with money appropriated from
the state emergency fund, but this
was found to be impossible. Then,
following a telegram from Dr. T. M.
McLachlan to the effect that all of
the o,ther regiments at the border
had motor ambulances and that one
was badly needed, a mbvement was
started last Friday to raise the $2,700
required by private subscription.
People all over the state have re­
sponded liberally to the call, but
there is much more to be raised.
TROOPS ORDERED BACK
El Paso, Texas, Aug. S.—Upon re­
ceipt of reports that a careful search
of the country surrounding Finlay,
Texas, had failed to disclose the pres­
ence of hostile Mexicans, General
Bell, Jr., tonight ordered the troops
to return to Fort Bliss if no bandits
are seen before tomorrow morning.

Berlip,, Aug. 2.—The announced
meetings of the national committee
for securing an honorable peace were
heid in about 40 of the larger cities
of Germany last night, but at none of
the meetings did the moderates give
any precise statements concerning
the conditions of peace as the moder­
ates would like to see them.
The speakers generally dwelt on
generalities, rarely going beyond the
chancellor's declaration with regard
to peace. Prof. Harnack, a speaker
at the Berlin meetings, made no sur­
prising statements regarding the
aims of the war, which Be specified as
the thrusting back of Russia from
Eastern Europe, where she was an
intruder, to the East, where she had
her mission, and a termination of the
situation on the west, where England
was the uncontrolled ruler of the sea,
and Belgium her vassal.
Prof. Harjiack warned against ex­
pecting or demanding too much from
the results of the war, as Germany

Assistant Postmaster Lundquist
Issues Encouraging Report
of Business Transacted.
TOTAL RECEIPTS THIS
YEAR EXCEED LAST
Postmaster Frank Reed .and his as­
sistant, Oliver Lundquist, have com­
pleted their report of the business
done during the past month. The re­
port shows that during July of this
year the total postal receipts were
$6,968.74, which is quite an increase
over the receipts for the same month
of 1915, when the report as compiled
showed the revenue to be $5,558.86.
Assistant Postmaster Lundquist
was somewhat backward in giving
out the report for July as he stated
that it did not really show the
enormous amount of business done at
the local office. Postmaster Reed's cap­
able assistant is very proud of the
efficiently of the Bismarck branch of
Uncle iSam's department and desires
that it be understood that the aver­
age amount of business for the year
is considerable morn tnan the figures
mentioned. August is one of the big
months at the postoffice and last year
the total receipts were $11,000. Mr.
Lundquist estimates that they will be
a much more during the present
month
Not alone are the receipts for July
month greater this year than they
were in the same month of 1915 but
reports for the quarters ending March
31 and June 30 also show a decided
increase. 'Last year the total recepits

Whether she submerged befor#
reaching the three-mile-limit Is ua»
known. The two accompanying boats
only know that she disappeared un­
harmed, and that to all appearances
she had a clear field ahead to a point
where she could completely submerga
in safety.
Half an hour after the last light of
the Deutschland had disappeared, the
Timmins, seemingly satisfied withi
her work, turned back and headed up
the Chesapeake bay toward Baltimore.
During a part of the day tha
Deutschland had remained hidden at
a cove up Chesapeake bay.
Start Under Ideal Conditions.
The trip of the submarine Deutsch«
land and the convoying tug Thomas
F. Timmins down the Chesapeake
bay from Baltimore was started under
ideal conditions. Not a cloud was in
sight as the submersible increased
her speed to 19 knots an hour, soon
after clearing Baltimore harbor. Tha
tug fell in behind immediately, and by
dark was SOD yards astern.
Dark flames spurted from the Tim*
mins' funnels, showing "hat the stok­
ers aboard were keeping all the steam
possible in her boilers. Then the
wind freshened and dark clouds be*
gan to roll in from the horizon. Soon
the tug was pitching and rolling, her
running lights dipping and the sprasr
flying back from her bow,
Report to Navy Department,
Washington, Aug. 2.—The com
mandant of the Norfolk yards sent
the following to the navy department:)
"U. S. S. Sterrett, reports: 'Sub­
marine reported by the Timmins to
have passed out of the capes at 8:30,
Am outside three-mile limit."
While the Sterrett's report did not
mention the Deutschland by mim,
navy officials have no doulbt the refer­
ence was to her. The Steirott, with
three other destroyers and tha cruis­
er North Carolina, it waa pointed oat.
were doing neutrality duty off tha
coast.
Late tonight, the department
received no further word to Inillraia
whether the submarine had pi—til
the three-mile limit
The Timmins* message was picked
up by the destroyer Sterrett, vhkk
relayed it to the Norfolk navy yard.
The destroyer then was outside the
three-mile limit to see that tha tab
mersible's pasage out was not inter*
fered with by the Allied cruisers off
the capes until she had passed a*t at
the territorial waters of tha United
States.
