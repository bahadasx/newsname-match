After llatenlng to arguments fol

Cockburn today decided to reserxe
Judgment until they had conferred
with County Superintendent Youn1-,

board. Mr. Young Is lu Portlund
now but will return within a few
days.
Hermlatun In remonstrating, con
tended that the petition for the
.hanging of the boundaries was not
legally sufficient aa the signers arc;
not qualified voters. From tn
quity standpoint, the Heruilston rep-l
resentatives claimed that the cutting!
off of the two sections, assessed at'
118,910, would be unjust inasmuch a
there Is a 3u,UU(.i bonded Indebted- .
ness against the district Moreover,
they contended, the majority af prop

("tided also that theer are hut two,

tention that the territory affected is
tributary to Stanfleld commercially
and that the people affected prefer
to send their children to the Stanfleld
schools. Children from the Colum
bia dlatrlcl attended the Stanfleld
schools last year, they said, and the
Columbia district paid the Stanfleld
district for receiving them However,
the Columbia district received more

clared. Mr. Sommerer. In answer to
this, stated that only the children of
one family were sent to Stanfleld and
that because their neighbor had the

three years have either departed from
the city or retired from the organ

have discouraged all attempts to re

What has the Round-Up meant tn
the merchants of Pendleton is a ques
tion which has oftimes been asked.
In terms of money, the value cannoi
be estimated exactly, but the mer
chants know from their Increased
business that the Round-Up
has had no small share in contribut
ing to their net profits.
One phase of business developed
here since the fame of the great
frontier exhibition has spread un'il
It reaches the four corners of the
United Slates has been the mail order
business. The business referred to is
the highly colored cowboy and cow
girl shirts, bandanos. and the famous
Round-tJp hat.
During the past year Charles Bond
of Bond Brothers, says his firm h.-U
received many orders from the fron
tier exhibitions at Los Angeles and
Salt Lake and from many of the cir
cuses which have added wild west
features to the big tent show. The
last large order which the Pendleton
firm received wa-s from Irwin Broth

officials witnessed the hanging He
died in ten minutes. The Penton
vllle prison bell tolled at seven min

side cheered and groaned. Casement
wore his own clothes instead of the
prison garb. He helped the execu

his limbs. He exclaimed: "Lord
have mercy on my soul." The cor
oner's inquest returned a verdict of
"death by hanging." Prison Gover

instantaneous.
