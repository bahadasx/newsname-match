H - ON THE BORDER.
The following poem was received by
Mr. Norman B. Boyle from Mr. Ober
Herr; who is a member of Co. H. Ist
Reg,, M. N. G., now stationed at Camp
Ord, Texas, on the Mexican border. The
sentiment of the poem shows the feeling
of the Guardsman for the climate and
natural surroundings of the camp. The
word H— rhymes with well and is to be
filled in by the reader.
The Devil in H— we’re told was chained,
And for a thousand years he there re
mained.
He neither complained nor did he groan.
But determined to start a H— of his own.
So he asked the Lord if he had on hand
Anything left when he made the land.
The Lord said, “Yea 1 have plenty on
hand,
But 1 left it down on the Rio Grande.
The fact is, Old Boy, the stuff is so poor,
I don’t think you can use it as a H— any
more.
So the Devil went down to look at the
truck,
And said if he took it as a gift he’d be
struck,
For after examining it carefully and
well,
He concluded the place was too dry for
a H—.
The Lord then promised the Devil to
water the land.
For he had some water or rather some
dregs,
A regular cathartic and smelt like bad
eggs,
So the trade was closed and the deed was
given,
And the Lord went back to his home in
heaven.
The Devil then said he had all that was
needed.
To make a good H—, and hence he suc
ceeded.
He began to put thorns on ail of the
trees,
He mixed up the sand with millions of
fleas,
He scattered tarantulas along all the
roads,
Put thorns on the on the catcus and
horns on the toads.
He lengthened the horns of the Texas
steers,
And put an addition to the rabbits ears,
The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion
stings,
The mosquitoes delight with their buz
zing wings.
The sand burs prevail and so do the ants
And those who sit down need half soles
on their pants.
The devil then said that throughout all
the land
He’d manage to keep up the Devil’s own
brand.
And all would be mavericks unless they
bore
Marks of scratches and bites and thorns
by the score.
The heat in the winter is a hundred and
ten,
Too hot for the devil and too hot for men.
The wild boar roams through the black
chapparell,
’Tis ah ofa place he has for H—.

Detroit, Mich. —Summer after sum
mer the fleet of the Lake Survey sails
the broad expanse of the live lakes
aud the score of bays aud iulets
searching for danger spots that may
claim their heavy toll In human life
aud vessel tonnage.
ITobably no frequented waterways
In the world are so hazardous as the
Great Lukes. At no time 1c a steamer
on them more than a comparatively
few hours from shore and periodically
tierce storms arise, fully us violent us
those experienced on the ocean, which
play with the steel ships, battering
them helplessly about, threatening to
engulf or sweep them ashore.
Over $5,000,000 has been spent by
the government since 1841 for the
prosecution of the work of charting
the lakes. Locked In heavy timber
boxes, protected from fire In Immense
vaults In the old post office building,
Detroit, are over 1,300 field charts,
dating back to 1818, when a survey of
lathe Erie was made by officers of the
British navy. With few exceptions
the ntaps are the result of the scien
tific researches of United States engi
neers and surveyors.
Work of Generations.
These maps represent the work of
generations of men who have tolled
to make the Great Lakes safe. As a
result of their Investigations light
houses have sprung from barren rocks,
and the solemn ringing of bells on
buoys carries their warnings to pass
ing navigators.
While the work of charting the
lakes has been carried on since 1841
with only one break In the task, which
occurred In 1880 and lasted until 1890,
there Is still much to be done to make
the survey a thorough one. In fact
It was only 12 years ago that what
might be called an unfailing system
for testing the depths has been devised.
Previous to that time the old meth
od of dropping a weight of twelve
pounds or so, trying to keep the line
plumb, was employed. The system
was far from Infallible.
This lightweight testing method was
employed until the DOs. Then came
the heavy 100-pound sounding bell.
This heavy obstacle was dragged
through the water, a machine on hoard
ship registering the angle the metal
was deflected from the boat as the
ship steamed along. The bell's sheer
weight made It an excellent drag. i
But this system was too crude and
Imperfect. Twelve years ago Major
Keller, United States Engineer corps,
in charge of the lake survey, devised
a method whereby a piano wire from
1,000 to 5,000 feet In length, slung
from two launches and weighted down,
was used to search for shoal spots
and other elevations of submarine
land.
Today this Ingenious device 1s In
use on the lakes and ns a result of It
many shoal and reef regions, hitherto
unknown, have been listed.
Increase In Commerce.
During the years of the decade be
ginning In 1830 the commerce of the
Great Lakes had begun to assume con
siderable proportions, and the Ameri
can government planned a canal at
Saulte Ste. Marie to connect Lake Su
perior and the lower lakes. The only
charting, however, hud been accom
plished by engineers connected with
the British navy.
In 1841 Cupt. W. O. Williams, who
was at that time In charge of harbor
Improvements In Buffalo harbor, was
ordered to take charge of the survey
ing of the Great Lakes. By 1878 what
was assumed to be a thorough survey
of the lakes had been made and the
following two years were spent In the
compiling of documents and the per
fection of charts then in existence and
circulation.
The years that had been spent up
to 1880 on making the geodetic or sub
marine survey of the lakes had wit
nessed marvelous changes. The flow
of population moved westward like a
tidal wave and cities sprang seeming
ly out of the very earth. The five
lakes were white with the sails of com
merce.
By 1890 schooners were fast becom
ing obsolete. The heavy draft
steamer that displaced water to the
depth of 20 feet hud driven the light!
vessels of 11 and 12 feet draft from I
the field.
That a resurvey must be made be
came evident. Provisions had been
made only for vessels of light displace
ment. Appropriations were made by
congress to carry on the work again.
In searching for a shoal area
as much as SIO,OOO has been spent.
The work of the Lake Survey has for
Its object the preparation of accurate
navigators’ charts of the lakes and no
pains are spared to make the maps
complete. The work of searching for
shoals is long and tedious. To sweep
a full square mile costs somewhere I

SEEK TO AVOID THE BLUES
One’s Troubles Frequently Wilt Bs
Found to Exist Only In the
Imagination.
There are a lot of people In this
world who seem to take a fiendish de
light in being miserable and in mak
ing others feel that way, too, remarks
the Brockton (Mass.) Times.
Some men, and some women, too,
surround themselves with an atmos
phere of gloom that eternal sunshine
couldn't dispel and through this dis
torting medium molehills grow to
mountains and there are tears and
groans whore there should bo smiles.
They wake up In the morning with ft
face that looks like a sodden dough
nut, and perhaps the sun is bright and
the birds are singing. They will grum
ble and say, “O, well, this won’t last;
we'll have bad weather yet before
night.’’ And should the sky grow
clouded and a refreshing rain moisten
the thirsty earth they shout In glee, "1
told you so.”
When they sit down to breakfast
they almost sour the cream they put
In the coffee, and the most tempting
breakfast does them about as much
good as a carpet tack sandwich would.
They grow dyspeptic, morose, pessi
mistic, cynical, hypochondriacal and
get to be downright nuisances.
If you ever get to feeling blue about
things stop and think what it will
mean if you keep it up and then pin
your mind so hard on your dally task
that there Isn’t room for another thing
in your head. That's the way to keep
the haunting spirit of pessimism and
despondency out of your heart.
And remember the world has no
time to listen to your troubles, for ev
ery one has troubles of his own, and
the chances are a good many have a
groat deal heavier burden to bear
than you have.
ALL AT “GENERAL MUSTER”
Everybody Was More or Less Inter
ested In the Militia Some De
cades Ago.
In considering the subject of pre
paredness It might be wise to look
up the old militia system that pre
vailed sixty or seventy years ago.
when states were divided into dis
tricts, each one having a company to
which all men of soldier age were re
quired to belong, and give a few days
each year to military drill, the Colum
bus Journal observes.
Every year there would be a “gener
al muster,” at which the various com
panies would gather, and under the
command of a plumed and bespangled
officer would perform the various evo
lutions and go through the manual of
arms that would strike with awe tho
surrounding crowd of women and chil
dren. gathered to witness the heroic
displays of fathers and brothers.
These general musters were great
events in the times of our grandfath
ers. They were social as well as mili
tary, and often adorned with feasts of
warlike provender. In one of his
speeches Tom Corwin tells of a gen
eral muster in which the bravo mili
tiamen, with bayonet and sword,
charged on a pile of watermelons and
cut the red hearts out of the enemy.
Shakeepearsan Humor.
McKean Buchanan, a California
tragedian In the olden days, was noted
for the roaring style in which he
played Shakespearean characters, also
tor his fondness for litigation, and
for never paying hla lawyers. J. Gor
don Eastman was posted as to this
last peculiarity of the “great Shake
spearean delineator,” as he styled him
self, and when Buchanan, filled with
wrath at an adverse criticism In a city
paper, determined to suo the editor
burst Into the lawyer's office and said:
“Sir, I wish to retain you,” the man
of the law replied; “Awfully sorry,
Mr. Buchanan, but 1 am retained on
the other side." Buchanan replied:
"The other side; what other side? Who
has retained you against me?” The
attorney replied, “Shakespeare's
ghost,” and the Interview closed.—
T. F.
Recognize the Death Song.
Walruses and seals and all true
mammals that have lungs and live In
the water have a bark that sounds
strange enough as it comes up from
hidden depths. Every lookout from
the masthead notices that, when one
whale Is struck, the whole school is
stampeded at the very Impact of the
harpoon. They have heard the death
song.
The sound that the bowhead makes
is like the long-drawn-out “hoo-hoo
hoo-00-o” of the hoot-owl. A whaler
says that the cry begins on F, and
may rise to A, B or even C before slip
ping back to F again. He avers that
with the humpback the tone Is much
finer, and sounds across the water
like the note from the D string of a
violin.
Need of Exercise.
Exercise In some form Is absolutely
necessary for health. We are so con
structed by nature that the digestive
tract and alimentary tract demands
bodily activity In order to perform Its
proper functions. Without It troubles
begin to appear. Constipation becomes
a chronic disease, the circulation be
comes poor, the liver and kidneys do
not work properly and a thousand and
one little troubles begin to make them
selves felt. You may begin to grow
corpulent because the body Is unable
to eliminate the surplus sugar and
starch products. Or you may grow toe
thin because the assimilative organs
are unable to work properly from lack
of proper exercise.
TALKS ON LOVE
AND MATRIMONY
Miss Helen Keller, Blind and
Dumb, Says All Women
Should Marry.
PICTURES HER IDEAL OF MAN
Must Be Handsome, of Course, but
Doesn’t Have to Be Rich or Pos
sess a College Education—
Glories in Her Family.
Chicago.—Love is a topic that Miss
Helen Keller avoids In interviews.
Yet this sightless and dumb prodigy,
who has overcome her human handi
caps—almost—has some unique opin
ions on this absorbing theme, writes
Harriet Ferrlll in the Chicago Trib
une.
She pounded them out on her fin
gers and tire face of her teacher, Mrs.
J. A. Macy, who has been with her
for twenty-nine years.
An eager face, lips that are ready
to laugh, and a flashing, alert mind
helped along the Interpretation of her
love sentiments.
"I am not telling my love affairs.’’
she spelled into the palm of her teach
er's hand. "They are not for publi
cation,” although she admitted many
proposals as a “star" —and possibly
one heart affair. There is said to be
a certain young man who is attentive
at this time.
Will Be a Master Man.
The master of the house in ideal
conditions such as are sensed by Miss
Keller in a new day is not of the com
mon species. He will be a master
man, willing to permit his wife to be
the disposer of the household supplies
and the real "boss.”
‘‘Every household should bo ruled
by a bi-cameral government—a con
gress and a senate —such as tho Unit
ed States gave the Porto Ricans,” she
said. “The woman should, of course,
be the house of representatives of the
family. In this government there
will be no filibustering, 1 hope, nor
lobbying.
"Thus, the man would propose all
vital measures and the woman would
dispose them. She would control the
disposal of supplies principally, as
women did among some of the prim
itive tribes.”
This ideal state of matrimony, how
ever. Miss Keller does not expect un
til woman is economically free. So
long as man is the "money bags." this
future marriage system will be miss
ing.
A happy interest flashed in her
sightless eyes when she was request
ed to describe her ideal man.
“Of course, he will be handsome for
eugenic reasons,” she said with a
smile. “He doesn’t have to be rich.
I am paying my own passage through
the world and am proud of It.
"And the ideal man doesn't have to
be possessed of a college education.
He must be one who thinks straight.
Many men have obtained an educa
tion by their own efforts, for example,
Mark Twain, one of my Ideal men.
For he was broad humanely, tender,
yet strong, and full of humor.
“Every marriage should have leva
and both man and woman should nev
er lose sight of the happiness of their
children. The state should pay for
the upkeep of each child; for there Is
no greater service to the state than
a woman’s gift of a child —a greater
service than the building of a war
ship. Besides, warships are no good
without men. Woman furnishes the
absolutely necessary supply—men.
Her services are fundamental In war
time or out of war.
"All women should marry If they
can get anyone to marry them." Her
teacher laughed her out of her seri
ousness. "Yes they should,” she in
sisted. “It s essential for the race—
and evolution in the world.”
One of the glories which Miss Kel
ler delights in is the glory of her
family. A great-great-grandfather of
hers was one of tho first colonial gov
ernors of Virginia—one of the Spatts
woods, and this is a cherished name.
She is a cousin of the southern kero,
Robert E. Lee, and counts the Adam
ses and the Everetts on her ances
tral tree.
Her mother, Mrs. Katherine Adams
Keller, is with her, busily darning
stockings and mending shirtwaists.
A sister, Mrs. Mildred Keller Tyson,
lives in Montgomery, Ala., her native
state, and a brother, Phillips Brooks
Keller, Is an engineer. Miss Keller
was a student and admirer of Phillips
Brooks when she was nine years old
and she Insisted upon giving her
brother that name, her mother said.

often vexed and astonished its mates
by flying away like the wind, nil went
well with tho happy family. To this
day the quail prefers to stay among

CITY BEAUTIFUL BY NIGHT
Stockholm Always at Its Best When
Viewed After Darkness, Is Opin
ion of Travelers.
The best time to get your first look
at Stockholm la by night. As you
come up the channel you see the town
All traced and (ringed with chains of
light. The ordinary Illumination of
the Stockholm streets and quays
makes them look as though the city
were decorated (or a fair. They are
lavish users of electric light In Swe
den, to Judge by the capital.
Their favor seems to shine on any
thing that works by wire. Take the
telephone, (or instance. Without com
piling statistics, it is a pretty safe
bet that there are more telephones
per capita In Stockholm than In any
other town on earth. They have ap
parently more phones than any city
needs and then again as many on top
of that. The latter circumstance Is
due to an inscrutable arrangement
which works long and short distance
calls on a different system. Instead
of one phone in your room, you have
two. Where an ordinary municipality
has one phono booth, Stockholm dou
bles. Tlie town is a sort of monument
to Alexander Graham Dell.
The most Imposing structure, of
course, is the telephone exchange. Af
ter that comes the royal palace, A
huge and beautiful building that enter
tained twenty royal families of Eu
rope at the same time In the days
when royal families were on speaking
terms. Nowadays, they are not send
ing out any house party Invitations.
Sweden is devoting her leisure mo
ments to being neutral and as she Is
much closer to the storm center than
we are, she has a correspondingly
harder time of it.
Not far from the palace Is the par
liament building. There Is only one
man on earth who may not cress the
threshold of this structure. That man
is the king of Sweden. When the king
wants to talk to the houses he sends
for them, as at the beginning of each
session.
Stockholm has a particularly beauti
ful natural setting, with her many
satellite islands, her big lake and her
wooded suburbs. The people are
cheerful and fresh-looking and ener
getic. The Norseman is an apparent
contradiction of the law that says na
tions must grow old. He set the world
by the ears 2,000 years ago and today
his racial force seems running high aa
ever.
BIRD IS EXPERT BRICKLAYER
Feathered Artisan Rolls Mud Into Pel
lets of Required Size and Erects
Substantial Home.
Years ago, before houses and barns
were as plentiful as they are now, the
cliff swallow used to build his house
of tiny mud bricks on the side of a
rocky cliff. The nest builders find a
convenient patch of clay, roll up the
mud into tiny pellets and carry they
to their nesting site. There they
fashion them into a home as skillfully
as any bricklayer could do It, rounding
it over the top like a roof and leav
ing a round opening for a door.
Today the bird doesn’t have to find
a cliff for his home. A sheltered place
under the eaves of a barn will suit
him Just as well. You’ll find more cliff
swallows today at home under the
eaves than you will In their ancestral
castles on the rocks.
The bird wears a shiny blue-black
coat and a brownish-yellow vest. His
tall, reddish-brown, is only slightly
forked, which distinguishes him from
the regular "swallow-tails.”
Perhaps you have been told that the
nest of the cliff swallow Is Infested
with bedbugs, and perhaps you have
torn down all the nests you could find
to get rid of the pests. This Is a
common slander against the swallow.
The nest contains no Insects which can
be communicated to the house. On
the other hand, the cliff swallow per
forms immeasurable benefit by de
stroying many leaf bugs and weevils.

Dental Room for Animals.
In order that the teeth of domestic
pets may be given proper attention, s
dental department has of late been
established In the Angell Memorial
hospital, a Boston institution for the
medical and surgical treatment of
dumb animals. Dogs, cats and other
animals are cared for by experienced
practitioners who work upon them
with almost as much care as If they
wore human. Even to many admirers
of dogs, the thought of giving at
tentlon to an animal's teeth may pos
sibly seem cdd. Yet the importance
of doing so is very apparent to any
one who realizes the close connection
between good teeth and good health.
So far the dental work has been con
fined chiefly to cleaning teeth, treat
ing affected gums and extracting now
and then a decayed tooth. The depart
ment, however, is well equipped with
instruments, and it is understood that
other work will be undertaken.—

Original 6ea Serpents.
The National museum at Washing
ton contains a notable display of the
bones of several species of extinct
mammals which, if seen alive in the
ocean, would be called huge sea ser
pents, They were carnivorous, and
their long, slender Jaws were armed
with formidable teeth. Although s
few remaining individuals of the group
may have given actual basis for the
sea-serpent stories, these extinct ani
mals were not reptiles, but mammals
which, like the whale and seal and
otter, had happened to evolve la aa
aquatic environment.
