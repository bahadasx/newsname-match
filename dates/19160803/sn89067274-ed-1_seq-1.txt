The election returns in Audrain
came In exceptionally slow and be
cause of the close races on the county

results were known and then they
were unofficial as some precincts had
not reported.
The results on the county ticket
were as follows:
For Prosecuting Attorney, R. D.
Rodgers.
For Representative, E. A. Shannon.
For Sheriff, Jamea G. Ford.
For Judge of Western District, C. C.
Bledsoe.

For Treasurer, H. H. Grafford.
For Recorder of Deeds, Mrs. Net
Stephens. For Judge Eastern District, J. W.
Renner.
Not since Hiram Moore and Sam
Bicklcy raced for City Attorney and
tied twice and on the third vote the
former was victorious by a few bal
lots, has there been such "hoss races"
in the local field. Last election J. C,
Ringo was defeated by H. H. Grafford
for Treasurer by 52 votes and this
time Mr. Grafford, by the unofficial
vote, is winner by 68 Votes. J. G.
Ford won the sheriff's race over C. B.
Eennan by about SO votes. Not un
til late Wednesday morning was it
definitely known that E. A. Shannon
had defeated Mr. Slonaker for the
Legislature. His lead was about 100
votes.
