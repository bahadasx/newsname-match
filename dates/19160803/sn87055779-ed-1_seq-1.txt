COSTLY FOR ARMY
Militiamen Allow Imagination
to Run Riot and Break
Up Border Guard.
lDtprnatlun.il News Service:
EL PASO, Tex.,-Aug. Ik Army of
ficers gravely considered today the
problem of checking the alarms ot
militiamen on border dutj- who al
low their eagerness for action to
gallop away with their imaginations
and judgment. - That the problem
was a serious one was admitted on
all sides today when cavalry, in
fantry and motor detachments re
turned to F.l Paso after the wildest
sort of wild goose chase SO miles
down the border to Findlay. Tex.
Instead of running down bandits
they ran down only a false alarm.
Meanwhile valuable troops had
been drawn away from a base. Cav
alry horses had been subjected to
hardships. Motor trucks had cut
up valuable roadways and had suf
fered the wear and tear of a rough
trip needlessly. Only the quarter
master can estimate the cost of the
trip.
As if the trip of this sort were not
enough, another van was under way
at Fort Hancock. An ambitious mil
itiaman came in with the following
report:
"There are three suspicious look
ing Mexicans to the north of us.
They have rifles and pistols and are
mounted. Bach one of them is on a
hill."
Scouts were sent out. After a busy
two hours they ran down a Texas
rancer who had been looking for
pome stolen cattle. He had mounted
three different hills and thus had
himself triplicated in the first re
port. Since the militia arrived on the
border there have been scores of
these wild alarms. So now olficers
are seriously discussing the idea of
assigning under officers to various
militia headquarters as ballast, a
sort of stability provision.

International News Service:
LONDON, Aug. H. Following
the execution of Roger Case
ment for high treason today,
(Javin Duffy, the legal represent
ative of Casement's relatives,
announced that the home office
had refused to turn oxer the
remains to the Casement fam
ily. Application had been made to
the home secretary for the body
in order that it might be buried
by the relatives.
Tot only wan thut rMiiest re-

Internatio nal News Service :
LONDON, Aug. 3. Declaring that
he gave up his life for his country,
Hoger Casement xvas hanged for high
treason in the yard of Pentonville
prison today. He went to his death
without emotion.
At eight minutes past nine, the
bell of Pentonville prison began toll
ing, proclaiming to those outside that
Casement had been executed.
The execution was marked by
dramatic and pathetic scenes. Back
of the prison a little group of about
.10 Irish men and women had
gathered. When the execution bell
began ringing these sobbing men and
women threw themselves upon their
knees and began ofTerins up pray
ers. Before he was taken before the
scaffold. Casement was admitted tJ
the Roman Catholic church.
The hanging of Casement wrote
the final chapter in a career of hu
manitarian activities.
Post Notice of Iveiition.
Immediately after the execution
the following notice was posted on
the prison wall:
"We, the undersigned, hereby
declare that the judgment of
death was this day executed on
Roger David Casement in His
Majesty's prison of Pentonville,
in our presence.
(Signed)
"R. K. MKTCALF,
'Acting Under Sheriff of Lon
don. "C II. DAVIKS.
"Governor of the Prison.
"James McCARROLL,
"Roman Catholic PrieM."
A second notice, bearing the fol
lowing information, was also posted:
"I, P. R. Marnier, surgeon to His
Majesty's prison at Pentonville, here
by certify that I this day examined
the body of Roger David Casement,
on whom the judgment of death was
this day executed in the said prison
and that on examination I saw the
said Roger David Casement xvas
dead."
Had Slight Hoik.
Although strenuous efforts had
been made to gain a reprieve for
Casement the condemned man evi
dently entertained little hope of es
caping the penalty for his crime.
In his final hours Casement did
considerable writing, but in the
meantime he did not neglect his rest.
Upon being asked by one of the
prison attendants if he had been able
to secure any sleep. Casement re
plied that "he slept like a top."
It was reported that Casement had
left a statement on his actixities in
behalf of Ireland. However, the
prison attaches failod to confirm
this report at the time of the ex
ecution. As the tall, bearded figure of the
condemned man was led to the gal
lows and just before the trap was
eprung, Casement was asked if he
desired to make a statement. The
prisoner, already with the shadoxv or
death upon him, turned to the offi
cials and said:
"I die for my country."
A few moments later the body
ehot downward and after a few con
vulsive struggles remained limp.
The corpse was cut down and exam
ined and afterxvards an autopsy was
conducted in the prison mortuary.
Memorable Scne in Cell.
There was a memorable scene in
Casement's cell just before the ex
ecution. The condemned man ex.
pressed a desire to be admitted into
the Roman Catholic church and a
messenger was at once dispatched to
the prison chaplin, the Rev. Father
Dean Rins and the Rev. Father Ca
rey hurried at once to Casement's
cell.
For a quarter of an hour the txxo
priests administered spiritual con
solation to the condemned nvm.
Casement uttered his concession and
received holy communion. The pris
oner seemed to derive Kreat conso
lation from the spiritual ceremonies
and was apparently brighter and
mre cheerful.
A few minutes befor? nine o'clock
the Lan0'inaa tutored Casement's
Ireland,

cell. Cawement arose at the en
trance of the executioner and made
a slight gesture as though to shoxv
his readiness for death. The pris
oner's deeply lined face xvas pale and
his eyes were sunken, but he nave no
evidence of fear. As the hour of
nine struk the death procession
formed and started for the gallows.
It xvas headed by the txvo Roman
Catholic priests who had been con
soling the condemned man. Follow
ing the priests were txvo warders
with Casement between them. Case-
merit's lip moved occasionally ;s
though in prayer.
The walk xvas short and the party
quickly reached the gallows.
As the sad little procession moved
forward the priests recited the litany
for the dying and Casement respond
ed in low tones: "Lord, have mercy
on my soul."
When the execution shed was
I reached the hangman approached
I Casement and pinioned his arms.
I The prison chaplains, the governor
ot the prison, the under-sheriff of
London and the under-sheriff of Mid
dlesex took up their positions in
front of the scaffold.
Casement xvas placed upon the
drop board and the lever was pulled,
dropping the prisoner's body through
space for a fall of about six feet.
There were no scenes of excite
ment in the neighborhood of the
prison, but extra policemen were on
duty and the streets adjacent to Pen
tonville were kept under constant
patrol. - .
The small Toup of mourning men
and women made no demonstration
of any kind, except xvhen they
started to pray during the tolling of
the execution bell.
While the bell xvas ringing the
prison gate opened and two prie;
dressed in black, emerged. They
walked quickly away.
As time passed the little group in
front of the prison gained in size and
soon a crowd of respectable propor
tions had assembled.
lloie of Iato Reprieve.
Considerable speculation xxhs arous
ed a few minutes before I o'clock
when a telegraph messenger arrixed
at the prison. sJome thought that an
eleventh hour reprieve had been
granted. Hope ran high but it was
soon dissipated.
The root's of th neighboring
houses around the priscm xvere uti
lized by some of the curious who
hoped to be able to see the hanging.
However, the persons occupying
those vantage spots xxete disappoint
ed for the execution took place in
side of a shed.
Casement paid the penalty for his
efforts in behalf of the Irish per)ple.
His activities in Germany, where he
tried to enlist Irish prisoners of war
in a battalion to fight for Irish free
dom formed the basis of the charge
agai'.st him when he was arrested
