Thirty-Four More Injured At Brad
ford, R. I. Last Night
EXPRESS RUNS DOWN LOCU
Wreckage Caught Fire and First Re
ports Were That Twenty Had
been Killed.
Westerly, R. I., April 18. The Gilt
Edge express which collided with a lo
cal passenger train on the New York,
New Haven and Hartford was four
minutes late and endeavoring to make
up time when it ran into the- rear
coach of the local at Bradford. Fivo
passengers were killed and 34 wound
ed. The responsibility for the acci
dent has pot yet been fixed.
Bradford, It. I., April 17. A score of
persons are reported crushed or burn
ed to death in a collision of trains on
the New York, New Haven and Hart
ford railroad here tonight at 7.30
o'ctock.
The dead were in the rear car of a
four coach local train bound from
lioston to New London, which had
stopped at the local station when it
was run down by the Gilt Edge Ex
press, bound from Boston for New
York. This coach was telescoped.
Great confusion followed the collis
ion and it was long before definite
knowledge of the extent of the disas
ter could be obtained. As the flames
of the burning cars and buildings died
out, the train yard was left in dark
ness and those who went to the assist
ance of the injured worked under
great difficulties.
The only telegraph lines in the town
went out of commission with the burn
ing of the station and the only com
munication with the outside was by a
single telephone wire. Over this hell
was summoned from Providence and
New Iondon. the former senuing a
wrecking train and physicians and the
latter city dispatching a. hospital
train. : ,, ,,, ' .. , "
Estimates of the dead varied widely
and in the absence of a positive ofli
cial statement the number could not
bo determined at midnight. At that
hour the ruins of the burned cars were
still so hot th' .hey could not be
thoroughly searched. Four bodies
were eurly removed and a count of
those who received emergency medi
cal treatment showed that thirty-five
who escaped were Injured. Several of
these would die. It was thought.
New York, April 17. From one to
three persons were killed and twelve
others were injured in the collision at
Broadford, It. I., tonight according to
a statement given out here by Gener
al Manager C. L. Bardo, of the New
Haven railroad.
Vice President Whaley of the New
Haven railroad declared shortly be
fore midnight that reports to the ef
fect that thirty or more persons had
been burned to death in the wreck at
Bradford were without foundation.
"We are absolutely positive," he
added, "that not more than three per
sons were killed, if that many."

Villa May Have Used Death of His
Lieutenant To Facilitate His Own
Escape.
San Antonio. Tex., Artl 18. Dis
patches received here from Gen Belle
at Kl.i'uso intlicato that the story of
ilia's death was manufactured in
Jaurez and the search for the bandit
chieJtain will be renewed on a more
::tensivQ scale. Coiibu! Letcher at
Chihuahua also doubt's the tiory of
the bandit's death.
San Antonio. Texas, April 17.
Major Gen. Funston said today that
the main line of communication of
General Pershing's troops in Mexico,
now as far south as Satevo, could not
be extended with the present number
of troops available, and expressed his
conviction that further operations
could not be conducted unless authori
ty was procured for the establishment
of a new border base, the free use of
railroads, or the material strengthen
ing of the forces now in Mexico, lie
said that in stretching the line to
Satevi. "iie maximum ol its elasticity
had been attained.
Detached columns of cavalry are op
erating south ol Satevo, hut only so
far as rations for man and horse can
be carried. The three detachments
that met at Santa Cruz, eight miles
from Panal, now have left there and
probably have fallen back on the line
at Satevo. General Kunston explain
ed that the country in that district
was barren of foodstuffs and that un
less the columns had gone back to
Parral Its return to Satevo must have
been necessary. He assumed the
troops had not returned to Parral.
The latest reports received by Gen
eral Funston in which mention was
made of Villa gave the bandit's loca
tion as in the mountains north and
west of Parral. Officers here declared
they were convinced that lie did not
succeed in getting as far south as the
Chihuahiia-Durango State line.
L'l Tato, Texas. April 17. Oni-ral
Gabriel Gavlra. Carranza commander
t Juarez, announced tonight that the
Mexican telegraph wires between
Juarez and Chihuahua had been blown
down near Pearson about noon, and
that lor this reason he was unable t
get any further details of the reported
discoverv of the body of Francisco
Villa.
A telegram filed ut Chihuahui' City,
presumably neiure me n:terrupuo:i to
the wire service, was received by The
Associated Press from Consul Letcher
saying that nothing was known in the
State capital regarding the finding of
the bandit's body.
These two circumstances combined
to reinforce the growing skepticism
here as to the truth of the story that
death had ended the career of the fu
gitive brigand. The story that the
man who Is really dead Is Pablo lo-
pee. the notorious butcher of Santa
Ysabel. and that Villa lias used Lo
pez's clout h as the basis of a false re
port of his own demise, was revived.
1 his story was retold today ny an
American owner of a large ranch in
the Guerrero district, who said lie had
received It from his ranch foreman
and believed it to be true.
Charles Hickerson, an American
who owns mining properties in the
Guerrero district, arrived nt the bor
der today and declared that he had
seen Villa two weeks ago in a ranch
house near Cuslhuirachic and that the
bandit's leg was badly swollen at that
time and lie was suffering much from
it. Mr. Hickerson said the bullet had
entered the knee and that a native dor
tor whom Villa had forced to nccom-
l.any his band, declared the wound
liad become infected from a partic:
of soiled cloth of Villa's trousers. The
doctor asserted the infection had
spread throughout Villa's body niul
was causing a high fever. The mining
man also declared that the country
around Satevo and Parral was infected
with Vllllstas and other bandits and
that tin? region was not sale for elth
er Americans or native .Mexicans.

ROAD MONEY COMING
State Commissioner Will Match That
Raised by Subscription.
State Highway Commissioner S. B.
Bates has notified County Supervisor,
James L. Davis that Bennington can
have the state money needed for the
west road to meet the amount raised
bv subscription. This amount is
J3500.
This money from the state is on
condition that the road is completed
from the state line to connect with the
road now built and also that Benning
ton resurface the road from Benning
ton village to the Woodford line and
that the main road beyond the new
section on Harwood hill be improved.
All the work must be done to the sat
isfaction of the state and county com
missioners. This arrangement will enable the
use of the regular town and state
money on the Woodford road and on
Harwood hill and will ensure the com
pletion of the west road to the state
limit. Taken as a whole it should
mean a greater advance in road build
ing in Bennington than in any previous
year.

Fotmer Attache Indicted for Con
spiracy to Destroy Welland Canal
mi EE BROUGHT TO TRAIL
Alleged Offence Not Extraditable Un-
der Treaty With Any Foreign
Government.
Xew York, April 17. Captain Franz
von Papen, recalled military attache
to the German embassy at Washing
ton, was indicted by the federal grand
jury here today as the organizer and
financier of an alleged conspiracy to
blow up the W'f Hand canal in C'uiada.
With him also were indicted Captain
ilans Taucher, alleged agent of the
Kntpps In the United States and hus
band of Mrne. Johanna Gadski, the
prima donna; Constantine Govani',
Alfred J. Fritzen and another whose
name has not been revealed. It was
learned from a reliable source that the
latter is a prominent German whose
namo has been mentioned frequently
in connection with German propagan
da, lib; arrest is expected tomorrow.
Federal officials do not expect to
bring von Papen to trial. While he is
no longer immune from prosecution by
the United States civil authorities
since he ceased to be a member of the
German embassy staff, the offense
with which he is charged is not ex
traditable under any treaty with a
foreign government.
The indictment, it is understood,
was returned with the sanction of the
department of justice, and is believed
to establish a precedent. No effort
will bo made to have von Papen
brought here, but the indictment will
be held in' abeyance In case he ever
should return to the United States.
The indictment charges, in addition
io the Weiland canal plot, that it was
"the purpose and intent of the defend
ants to blow up and destroy other
property in Canada."
Von Fa pen was designated by feder
al oflic'al as the i'brains" of tho al
leged conspiracy. It is alleged In the
indictment that he, with the others,
"began, set on foot, provided and pre
pared the means for a certain military
enterprise to be carried on from with
in the territory and jurisdiction of the
United Stales against the territory
and dominions of the King of Great
Britain, with whom the United States
at all times mentioned was and is at
peace."
