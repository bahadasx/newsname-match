of Gen. l'erghingr, commander of the

are wUhheld by the government be
cause of the fear that to make them
public at this time might seriously
embarrass the Mexican operations.
However, it is understood that Gen.
Pershing emphatically denied that at
any time the Carranza commanders i
have cooperated with him in hl i

reason to believe that they have done,
everything possible to emharra--R the
