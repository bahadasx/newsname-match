Exported conflict in the twenty-tifth
Continental Congress of the daughters
of the American Revolution over the
office of editor of the magazine and
the clash >>f feeling between this position
and the committee on publication
of the magazine broke loose this
afternoon, when the report of the magazine
committee was made the order
of special business at the opening ot
the session.
An undercurrent of feeling on this
j subject had been noted in several of
'the reports and in a comment from
tin- platform by the president general.
" This feeling is focused over the resignation
?>f Miss Natalie Sumner Lincoln
because a report she made to the 11a
tional board as editor was misconstrued
. as an attack on the chairman of the
j magazine committee and was tabled.
-I.Miss Lincoln emphatically denied today
the report that is current about
.the congress that she is a candidate
again for editor.
Deficit on Magazine.
In the report of the treasurer gent
oral it was brought out that the publication
of the magazine had incurred
1 a deficit of $9,64S.47. Miss Florence T5.
Finck, chairman of the magazine committee.
made her report on this matter
this afternoon, and Miss Lincoln is pre
pared to respond and present her side
if she can get recognition on the floor.
Mrs. Mary S. Lock wood, the chaplain
general, broached this controversy in
her report today when she said: "Do
. not let us forget that when the nation'
al board looks for a report of our mag|
azine from the editor and the busii
ness management they are in accordl
{ ance with our law." She also said:
"The censure of the board should
I come when they neglect to carry out
the law as laid down in the constitu?
tion, not when trying to live up to it.
I The only party, if we must have par'
tisanship. should be to uphold the con.
slitution that has carried us through
the years and made this society one
? of the m<jst successfully organized in
the world."
Immediately following this Mrs. Story
said: "Without criticism of any report
that has been made here today. I want
to state that there is 110 business mana1
ger of the magazine and that the only
( salaried officer is the editor."
Creates Big Demonstration.
The biggest demonstration at the
morning session today was when it
was announced from the stage that the
, debt on Memorial Continental Hall had
been reduced to $25,000. Mrs. Story
, said that $20,000 had been paid today
t and that the indebtedness has been re
duced $100,000 during her term in office.
The delegates cheered and applauded
and it was many minutes be'
fore the national officers could continue
with their reports.
Mrs. William A. Smoot, the organizing
. secretary general, said that 7,539 new
membership cards were issued, there
were 1,033 resignations, SS0 dropped for
non-payment of dues and one expelled.
. J She gave the actual membership as 91,1
! 990 and an admitted membership of
123.321. and claimed an actual increase
t of 4.693.
Mrs. Mary S. Lock wood, the chaplain
> general, was accorded an ovation when
1 she arose to make her' report. She
. waved her bouquet at cheering friends
. in the audience. She said she wonder.
ed if any other member has attended
every other one of the twenty-six
congresses of the society.
With extreme delicacy she touched
upon the controversy over her right to
-> be recognized as the founder of the D.
j A. ft., when she gave a "few facts on
our organization of October 11, 1890."
- She described a meeting at her own

her regarding the organization of the
Daughters ?the inference being that
she was recognized as the leading and
guiding spirit in this (.reaniiatinn

Use Made of Dues.
She described the work that is done
, with the dues and said that "the Sons

The postponement of Premiei
Asquith's statement, which lie
had promised to make this after
noon, was taken as an indicarior
j that the cabinet ministers wen
unable to reach an agreement 01
this subject, which lias brouglt
about the most serious crisis the
prime minister has had to meel
in his eight years as head of tlu
government.
Still Striving for Solution.
The decision came as a complete surprise
to those not within the inner circle,
but it later transpired that negotiations
had been in progress during
the night and early morning with thai
end in view.
Besides the cabinet meeting there was
a conference of the special committee
appointed to make a final effort tc
bring about a solution of the problem
but, like the cabinet, it was unable tc
reach an agreement, ahd a postponement
of the premier's statement became
imperative unless an immediate
break-up of the coalition was to bt
faced.
Lloyd George's About Face.
The special committee consisted ol
David Lloyd George, the minister o:
munitions, who. putting all his old principles
behind him, has come out strong
ly for compulsory service for all mer
of military age; Field Marshal Ear
Kitchener, secretary for war, who als<
favors conscription; Gen. Sir Willian
Robertson, who is expected to follow
the course of his chief; Walter Hum<
Long, president of the local govern men

J bers- in the cabinet, and Arthur lien
j derson, president of the hoard of edu
J cation, who, like the labor party, is
| opposed to any further extension o.
compulsion.
Premier Asquith is expected to ex
plain in the house of commons th<
reasons for the postponement of hi:
statement, and will he asked when tin
government's decision will he coinmu

Resignation Threat Stands.
'i'he attitude which David Lloyr
I George. the minister of munitions, wil
assume toward Ah\ Asquith" regarding
recruiting is somewhat of a puzzle t<
the newspapers. The Daily Graphi'
comments as follows:
"Lloyd George's position is obscure
Apparently ire has not resigned, hut
on the other hand, he, has not with
drawn his ihreat to resign. He insist:
upon a definite agreement between tin
cabinet and army council. He insist:
that the poli< \ pursued by the cabine
! regarding recruits shall be based upoi
I ifroinincndations by the army counci
[as to the army's need of men.
Lloyd George needs 90,000 men fo
munition work and in advocating gen
eral compulsion he counts upon securing
for munition work those of tin
married men who are less adapted fo
service in the field."
The Daily News urges the govern
merit, as a possible way out "f its dif
Acuities, to make public tin- figure
reached by the army. The total mini
ber of men trained and in training am
figures showing the number of mei

FEELER FOR PEACE,

1 Speech by German Chancellor i
Interpreted by Former

LONDON. April IS. ? The Morning ;
Post's Budapest correspondent sends the
following statement by Count Julius Andrassy,
the former Hungarian premier,
published in Budapest, commenting on
the recent speech of the German chanE
cellor, Dr. Yon Bethmann Hollweg:
f "The speech is actually the first official
German feeler for peace. The
^ chancellor defines Germany's attitude
j | quite distinctly, explaining what he
) j wants from Russia, what he does not
1 want from France, what he intends to
do with Belgium and also his views on
L financing the colonies. \
Basis for Peace Negotiations.
"The speech is a basis whereupon
, peace negotiations ruay be begun?con?
ditions which leave the door open to
.counter demands. fclvery one of bis rej
marks is a possibility which carries the
a j germ of future developments and the
s I basis of further argument. The speech
I bp reached.
_! "If frenchmen read his words with
jj unbiased minds they will see that Gori
many wants only to safeguard her
. frontiers. The chancellor does not ask
'the annexation of Belgium, but only
! that -Belgium shall not become a bulj
wark of Anglo-French forces, whence
j J they could swoop down on Germany.
1 j No Indemnity Demanded.
"The demand for indemnity from
France has been dropped, and the only
word about indemnity is the suggestion
that Russia indemnify the population
of East Prussia for the devastation
done there.
s j "As regards the German colonies, the
j chancellor asks only that some of
i tin-in be returned. Germany will not
^ ; even press for the return of all ol
them, and considers only the ptobabil1
; ity of saving a few of thorn."

sensationally on the Amsterdam exchange

Von Papen and Four Others Indicted
on Charge of Conspiracy to Blow
Up Welland Canal.
XEW YORK, April IS.?Wolfe von
I gel, secretary of Frank von Papen,
I former military attache to the German
embassy, was arrested here today in
I ('apt. von Papen's former office at 60
Wall street after a fist fight with
four agents <>f the Department of Justime.
Von Igel is the fifth man. indicted
yesterday with von Papen,
charged with conspiracy t<> blow up the
Welland I'anal in Canada.
Von Igel's name had been withheld
by the federal authorities pending his
arrest. When the four agents of the
Department of Justice entered his oftii
?- today lie put up a fight in which
he was assisted by George von Skall,
an employe.
Von lgel. before im was overpowered,
succeeded in reaching safe in the far
corner of the room, banging the door
shut and turning the ei.mbination. He
was not subdued, the federal agents
said, until the\ pointed revolvers at
him. He then declared that he was on
German territory and protested that
the United States authorities had no
right to invade that territory.
Charges Russian Methods.
"Go ahead and shoot," his captors reported
liim as saying. "It will only
cause war between the United States
and Germany. You have no right to
invade this office. It is German territory.
These are Russian methods."
Von lgel made a similar statement
when arraigned later before Judge
i Howe. Hacking a lawyer, he was told
j by the court that his arraignment
i would be postponed until later, when
! his plea that lie had been illegally arJ
rested could be formally entered.
J Von lgel was detained in the federal
, building in the meantime in the cusI
tody of the federal officers. His assistant,
von Kkaul, attempted during the
proceedings to get Count von Bernstorlf.
the German ambassador at
Washington, on the telephone. He did
not have the telephone number and
after the operator had vainly tried to
ascertain it the call was canceled.
Others indicted were ('apt. Haas
Tauscher. alleged agent of the Krupps
in the United States and Husband of

j Alfred A. Fritzen and Oonstantine Govan

Specific Charges.
It is charged that von Papen planned
the conspiracy, that Tauscher supplied
the explosives and firearms and that
Fritzen and Govani carried the dynamite
to Niagara Falls. ?
(.'apt. Tauscher was arrested several
lavs ago. Fritzen and Gova,nf are at

?>f i'apt. von l*apen, hut asserted
that his indictment carried a certain
amount of punishment because ho could
never return to the United States from
Germany without running- the risk of
arrest and trial.
His indictment was obtained, they
said, because they believed whatever
stigma and indictment carries should
be attached to his name, and as a possible
warning of tlie abuse of diplomatic
privilege bv representatives of

CAPITALWINSFIGHT"
FOR LOIR RATES
Railroads Must Meet Demand!
I
for More Favorable Freight
Charges.
Washington commercial organizations
and business men have won their fight i
to force the Baltimore and Ohio and (
Pennsylvania railroads and other rail- ,
roads participating in the traffic from
New York and other eastern points to 1
put in commodity rates to Washing- !
ton. The effect of the decision of the <
interstate commerce commission today
is to provide lower rates on products
now moving into Washington, includ- '
infi many articles of food.
1 ho case was hied some months ago ,
by the Chamber of Commerce and Retail
Merchants' Association and about
1 f.o individual merchants. The complainants
sought reparation on shipments
made under the commodity rates, t
but this was denied by the commission. ^
Seem to Call for Correction.
"The wide difference in the rail rates t
to Washington on the one hand and to ^
j Fredericksburg. Richmond and Petersburg
on the other, presents a situation
of relative injustice to the business interests
of Washington which would
seem to call for correction," said the
commission', in its opinion. "The .
freight charges on some articles of
commerce In less-than-carload lots
would l?o less to Washington if moved
on commodity rates to Fredericksburg
and then on the local rate back, than 4
if moved to Washington direct." ]
The contention of the Washington
! merchants that commodity rates should 1
j apply on a like number of articles to 1
this city as to Richmond. Fredericks- ]
| burg and Petersburg i j approved by ,
t the commission, but the body did not
issue an order compelling the railroads
to put the rates in force, giving them ;
an opportunity to voluntarily adjust j
their rates, in accordance with the .
views expressed in the opinion. J
May Revive Proceedings. (
"If this is not done within sixty days
from the service of this report," the
opinion says, "the complainants may
bring the matter to our attention by sup- M
pie mental petition, making the interested
carriers south of Washington parties,
whereupon the commission will further
consider the case and enter an appropriate
order."
The commission reaffirms its opinion,

The application of the railroads for
permission to maintain lower rates to

by the commission.

William M. Ingraham, former mayor

of Meredith Nicholson, the Indiana

i Funston Asks Detailed Report.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. April 18.?Gen.
I Funston today asked that a report be
i made to him at once on the unofficial
. | rumor that a trainload of forage
. shipped -from Juarez to Chihuahua and
L intended for the American troops had
( been seized by Carranza authorities.
[ The arrival of sortie of the supplies
. sent to Chihuahua has been reported,
hut no advices that they had reached
the army had been received.
(Jen. Funston is awaiting the confirmation
of the story that Villa was
dead. No American official has sent any
report other than unconfirmed reports
from Mexican officials.
den. Bell, reporting from EI Paso to
Maj. (Jen. Funston. gave it as his
I opinion, after as thorough an investigation
as he could make, that the report
of Villa's death had been manui
faetured in Juarez. Consul Eetcher,
who said he had been in communication
ivvith Cusihuiriachic, also has failed to
! verify the report.
Villa Has Chance to Escape.
i If Francisco Villa is not dead he has
] now art excellent opportunity to escape
into territory far beyond the most advanced
of the American detachments,
i because the punitive force has pene|
trated about as far south as it is going
with the present organization, official
'admission that it was impossible to exi
tend the main line of communication
'south of Satevo was taken today to
| mean that the fielfc of operations would
| be restricted to that district over which
detachments of cavalry with provisions
j for one or two days could ride. B<yond
I the arc of that fan Villa will he safe as
'far as the Americans are concerned.
j (Jen. Pershing is believed to have ?x- 4
i plained in detail this phase of the sit!
nation in a report to Funston and
j to have made recommendations . that
more effective facilities for tire pursuit
j of Villa he authorized. The drive of the
j three cavalry columns to Parral and its
'environs established the fact that every
j force sent forward must depend whollv
Ion the quartermasters with the main
j column for supplies. They were reportI
ed to have fallen hack to Satevo. hut
'whether they have started out again to

j not been told.
j Officers here regard .the Parral inciI
dent as indicating elearly that den.
i Pershing's men now have to guard themselves
not onlv against attack by Villa's
men, but by those detachments of Carranza's
army that are antagonistic to
his announced attitude of co-operation.

or the cabinet
Funston Report
would reveal. The substance of the
message, the Secretary said, was beyond
the realm of public discussion at
this time.
It is understood that the reports
show Gen. Pershing's men to be south
now of the fartherest southern point
at which Villa's trail has been even indefinitely
located. The pursuit apparently
is swinging to westward, into the
more mountainous regions.
Renewed sniping around Parral was
not reported to the department, although
news dispatches from Gen.
Pershing's camp disclosed that American
troops had again been fired upon by
Carranza troops.
Necessity of Further Instructions.
War Department officials would 'not
discuss the probable result of the continued
hostility. It was intimated.
however, that even without this new
incident. Gen. Pershing might have
thought it necessary to call the department's
attention to the situation
very fully and to await further instructions.
It was thought probable that.he
would avoid any possibility of further
clashes until he. was advised as to the
wishes of President Wilson.
In that event, it was said, it seemed
probable that present operations at
the front are of a limited charayr.
