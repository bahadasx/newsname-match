EL PASO, April 18.?Reports were;
Tecelved hero Tuesday from Mexican :
sources tbat the American advanced
detachments had been recalled by
General J. J. Pershing and that the
expeditionary force was being concentrated
In three places, a strong
detachment being encamped near
Satevo, the main column near Namlqulpa
and a third division at Colonla
Dublan.
' These reports also stated that the
Parral lighting bad a most unfortunate
efTect on the people of northern
Mexico and has greatly inflamed the
anti-American feeling. The Parral
Incident, It was said, had been magnified
by anti-American and antl-Car ranza
agitators into a great battle
| in which the Americans were badly
'beaten. The Mexican dead were accounted
for as unarmed citizens, who
had been killed by the Americans before
the Parral garrison could Interfere.
The excitement of the people had
been very much Increased, according
to the same reports, by their knowledge
that Villa, dead or alive, bad
never gone as far south as Parral, and
their consequent inability to understand
why the American cavalrymen
were In that district except on the
assumption that they were really In-:
vading Mexico.
The miser)' of the peons ravaged 1
' by disease and facing starvation Is;
making It more difficult than ever for
the authorities to keep them In control.

Parral attempted to ambush the command

other reports of strained relations1

UWfBBRPORT, April 17.?To the
people of Harrison county: __
L. Wayman Ogdcn. the subject of
this sketch, whose friendly face appears
above, and who has heretofore
made formal announcement of his
candidacy for the Republican nomination
for Bheriff, Is well known In almost
every household of Harrison
county.- The writer has been acquainted
with Mr. Ogdcn nearly all his life,
and it is with much pleasure that this
article is offered.
Mr. Ogden was born in Eagle dlsI

trlct, the hot bed of Republican, fortytwo
years ago. Not unlike many of the
young men from the rural sections of
the country, he was compelled by circumstances,
to hue his own way
through many adverse and trying difficulties
which beset his path. These
obstacles, however, did not deter him
In his struggle for the accomplishment
of higher Ideals and greater
efficiency In life, but rather proved a
stimulant to his ambition. At an early
age he lost his father and mother,
which left him wholly on his own tesponslblllty
and resources, and It was
through his Initiative alone, that he
has been able to accomplish the
Ideals pf his youth.
In early life Mr. Ogden displayed an
Intense Interest in books, and through
continuous and persistent efforts he
successfully completed the free
schools in the country, and later attended
Salem College, Fairmont State
Normal and the West Virginia University
at Morgantown. He began his
career as a public :school teacher at
the age of twenty-two years, and was
readily recognised as a leader in the
teaching fraternity and In educational
affairs generally. He served as a
member of the board of teachers' examiners
for Harrison county and continued
as such until he was elected
superintendent of free schools for
Harrison county on. the Republican
ticket, leading the ticket by a handsome
and complimentary majority,
both In the primary and general election.
Arter completing his service as a
public official; Mt. Ogden went to
South America, where he spent three
years teaching Iff the American colIN

South America was completed, he returned
to his dative state and located
at Clarksburg, and was very active In
organising the Clarksburg Trust Company.
one of the leading banking Institutions
of Clarksburg, with which
Institution be holds a responsible position.
He has always taken an acllvo
part, and gives his unqtialled support
to every meritorious enterprise for tho
uplift of the community in which ho

dealing with'men,-peculiarly fit him
las an Ideal candidate for the offlce of
Sheriff of Harrison county to which
' he has offered himself, subject to the
| will of the voters of the Republican
, party. He la industrious, a man of
broad experience, wide acquaintance,
capable, self-possessed and always
courteous, which will commend him
most highly to the voters at the primary
to be held on the 6th day of
June.
It was through his own Initiative
that Mr. Ogdcn announced himself for
the Republican nomination for sheriff,
and he was the llrst of the candidates
to enter the race. Mr. Ogden Is in the
contest to win, and the promise of support,
that Is being given him each day,
Is very encouraging to him, and he
.feels confident of the outcome. He Is
making n clean and aggressive fight
for the nomination, and has nothing
but words of praise for his worthy
opponents. Those who know him best
and have seen blm In the midst of
former campaigns, recognize and fully
appreciate his ability as a campaigner.
Not only Is he able to see the voters,
but he Is competent to hold the office,
both of which are of vital Importance
and must be taken into consideration
when choosing a candidate. If elected,
he will fittingly administer the affairs
of the office with honor and dltslnctlon
to himself. In that free and courteous
. manner, a distinct characteristic of
his, to the complete satisfaction of his
constltuancy, so as to reflect credit
on the party of which he Is a loyal
member.
In closing, let mc say that the voters
of .Clarksburg and vicinity are asked

Mayor 0. H. Gordon Tuesday
morning appointed members of the
police force tor the ensuing year.
The size of the forco Is reducod by
one matr. two patrolmen being dropped
end another taken on. The men
dropped are Patrolmen Michael
Joyce and James Sims. John ftayeS
Is tho new member or the force.
Chief llrooks has ordered all the
members of tho force to bo present at
police hendqunrt'ors at 6 o'olock this
ovenlng to reqelvo Instructions. Putrolmen
will be notified of their
beats, and other matters pertaining
to efficiency In the department will
bo discussed. . ,
The officers appointed by the mayor
are ns follows: Ceorge Iserihartf
desk sergeant, and Patrolmen w. J.
Davlsson, A. M. Donahue;' Danlql
r out, j noniAK uiu, ueorge howo, i
John Hays, John Sherman, U. 0.
Shope, L. L. White and William H.
Yates.
In announcing the appointments,
the mayor stated that Sergeant Isenhart'n
hours bad been changed. In
the past, the sergeant has worked
from noon until midnight. By this
arrangement Lieutenant Whyte was
given opportunity to supervise the
work of putroluien from 6 o'clock
until midnight. In the future, however,
Sergeant Isenbart will work all
day, and Lieutenant Whyte will remain
at headquarters at night.
John Hayes, who was added to the
force by the mayor. Is not a novice
at polloe work, lie had soveral
months' experience under Mayor W.
H. Cole.
Although he Is named as patrolman.
It Is thought that L. L. Wlte
will be used principally as a plain
clothes man, he having shown In the
last few months that he Is well fitted
for this task. All pellce raids, as a
rule, have to be approached by a certain
amount of detective work, and
Mr. White has, a In tbe last few
months, secured cvldenco In a number
of cases whlcd le to raids.
Nicholas M. Whyte will continue
as lieutenant of police. He was appointed
by the city council at Its
