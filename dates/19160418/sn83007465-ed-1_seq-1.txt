Enters On
The most gigantic conflict In the
story of the world, the battle of
erdun, has entered upon its ninth
eek. It is in many respects withit
precedent. The enormous scale
the German preparations and exution
of the attack, the unparallel-'
I concentration of artillery and the1
stained ferocity of the fighting
ark the battle as one of the greatt
efforts of the war.
Verdun lias been rated as one of
e strongest fortresses of Europe, a
rnerstone of the French defenses
;ainst Germany. The evolution of
ilitary tactics during the war, hower,
and particularly the einployent
by the Germans of long range
>witzers capable of reducing the
eai-st forts have done much to
ange the character of the Verdun
mpaign as compared with the
rlier conceptions of what such a
rugg'e might be. Refore the bat?
opened the French partly disman d
their forts around Verdun an-'
re as elsewhere on the various

Ninth Week
estimates are approximately correct
nearly 400,000 men have been eli-1
minated as fighting units.
The ground occupied by the Germans
after 56 days of offensive |
operations may be roughly calculated
as 100 square miles. They have
forced back the French from their
outlying positions to the definite line
of resistance alone the semi-circular
frontfrom the edge of the Argonne
eastward across the Meuse and south-1
ward into the Woevre. For mno#
part of this main lino has withstood
the shook of successive attacks. The
Germans captured Fort Douaumont
early in the campaign and have bitten
into French defenses at Dead ,
Man's hill and elsewhere, hut at no'(
point have they succeeded in breaking
through. ,
The drive was begun on February (
21 by the German army under Crown i
Prince Frederick William. The (Jer- ;
mans are reported to have brought i
up seven army corps or about 280.- 1
000 men to reinforce the troop* 1
which had been in service there, and <
iit-iiiiy, according to French ao- 1
counts, other large bodies of re- I
serves were called. After an unI

the ! "fa-try attack was launched. 1
An urofficial French est'mate placed I
the number of attacking tJermans in

to Lend Credibility to
Rumor
CARRANZA REPORT
MIGHT BE ENOUGH
Intimated That United States Would
He Satisfied and Withdraw Troop*
on Ilasis of de Facto Government
Assurance of llamlit's End.
Washington, April 17.?Confirmation
of the death of Francisco
Villa was still lacking to-night at
the state ancl war departments and
at the Mexican embassy. The only
dispatch from American sources tn
Mexico tending to lend color to the
report was a brief statement from
Maj. Howze of the Eleventh cavalry,
now near T'arral. that he had information
which led him to believe that
the bandit and a few followers had
fled some days ago toward Barja.
close to the place where unofficial
Mexican reports say the body was
found. The outstanding feature of
the day's border messages were reports
that six Mexicans who confess
vu ui nave tanon part in tne raid
on rolumbus, N. M., had been captured
and sent to Columbus for trial
by state authorities. Another official
report relieved anxiety as to th?
supply problem for the troops at th?
front. It said the forces were now
fully supplied with the exception of
a small shipment of horse shoes and
clothing, which would go forward tomorrow.
The body supposed to be that of
Villa was said in the last Mexican
reports to be enroute to Chihuahua
City. It was pointed out at the war
department, however, that the point
where it was found was nearly two
days' Journey by wagon from the
railroad.
No Identification Orders
If Con. Fnnston and Con. Pershing
have taken any steps to make
certain th< identification of the body
I they have done so on tlielr own initiative.
No instructions to that end
have been sent front Washington.
This fact may he significant of th"
attitude of the state department. It
was intimated to-day that the United
States might he willing to accept
a formal declaration from Carranza
that Villa had been killed and order
the recall of the troops.
Chairman Stone of the senate for- '
elgn relations committee, after &
conference to-day with Secretary BaI
ker, expressed the view that the Car;
ranza authorities could hardly hav^
any object In circulating a report of
Villa's death unless they believed it
to be true. He agreed with Secretary
Baker and other officials, however,
in accepting the reports of the findine
??f viii?1
uuuy wun utmost caution.
It is generally admitted that every
day the troops remain in Mexico increases
the possibility of serious
clashes. While there has been no
evidence of opposition to the movements
of the American forces by de
facto military or civil officials, the
Parral incident has served as a warning
that the civil population and
even the troops can not always b?
controlled.
Was Complete Upset
The attach on Maj. Tompkins*
command at Parral came after cordial
relations had been established
with the Carrnnza military commander
there. The Mexican officer's efforts
were unavailing to curb the
disturbers, many of whom were said
to be his own soldiers. It is known
that the United States would gladly
withdraw the troops to-morrow if It ^
could consider the object of the exnod
I Hon > ? ? " "
, o? cuiiiyiisnea. In some
quarters the suggestion was mailt
that reports of Villa's death might
have b?*en circulated for the effect
on the Mexican people ar.d that they
were not intended to reach bevond
the border. It was pointed out that
it would add to the estimation In
which Carranza military chieftains i
1 1 it they were ah!-* to shotv
'he bo !y ai. proof that the American
expedition was unnecessary.
