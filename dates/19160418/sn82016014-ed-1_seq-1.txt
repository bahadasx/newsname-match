CRISIS!
Break With Germany Imminent
As President
Checks Submarine Controversy
Up to Congress.
Washington, April 18. President
Wilson will go before congress to
morrow and lay the entire German
submarine issue before both houses.
A break in diplomatic relations is said
to be imminent.
The president already has complet
ed the communication he will deliver
to congress. Up to the present time
it ha d been thought he would send
this communication to Berlin. It was ;
decided, however, that the situation
had become so serious as to requite
more drastic steps.
Aria ngements were made at the
capitol for passing a resolution imme
diately providing for a joint session
of both houses tomorrow to receive
the president's message. The con
tents of the message will be kept con
fidential and copies of it will not be
given out until after its delivery to
congress.
Secretary Tumulty went to the cap
itol after today's cabinet meeting and
took up the question with Majority
Leader Kitchin of the house. Majority
Leader Kern of the senate ard Sen
ator Stone, chairman of the foreign
relation committee. They immediate
ly went into conference with Speaker
(Mark of the house.
Both houses passed promptly a res
olution providing for a joint session
in the house chamber tomorrow aft
ernoon at 1 o'clock. There was no
announcement as to the purpose of
the president's coming.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, called on Secretary
Lansing late this afternoon and was
told by the secretary that he could not
discuss the submarine issue with him
at this time. It w;; announced aft
ei ward that the situation was un
changed and was stated that the dis
patch of the note to Germany would
not be delayed because of the visit.
It was taken for granted on both
sides of the capitol this evening that
drastic action was Impending.

El Paso. April 18. Offsetting Con
sul Gavira's announcement that the
story of finding Villa's body had been
affirmed, was a code message from
Cusihuirachic received from E. P.
Ryan of the Cusi Mining company's El
Paso offices, making no mention of
the reported death of Villa.
Gavira's advices Sunday were that
the body was being brought to Cusi

Wilmington. Del., April 18. Ernest
Schiller, alias Hudson, who recently
held up the British steamer Matoppo
on the high seas and terrorized the
crew, was arraigned in the United
States district court here today on the
charge of piracy, and in reply to the
usual question whether he pleaded
guilty or not guilty, said with a smile:
"Yes. sir."
Judge Bradford accepted this an

Schiller remanded for sentence. No
date was set for imposing sentence.
Schiller had no counsel when he stood
before the court and listened patient

He seemed to be unconcerned.

Mass Attach Fails.
Paris, April IS. After six days' rest ;
; while stocks of ammunition were re- j
: plenished, the Germans have again
begun concentrated attacks upon dif
i ferent points of the French defenses
at Verdun. The first point selected
; was the one-mile section between the I
Meuse and Douaumont, which forms i
1 a salient that seriously impedes the j
enemy. It includes the famous Pep
per hill. Approaches to this position
are further enfiladed by trench bat- !
i teries on the west bank of the Meuse
I and it was with the view to facilitat- ;
! ing operations against the salient that1
; the Germans made their recent offen
sive against Cumieres and Deadman's
j hill. That having failed, they now
are trying the effect of direct wear-i
ing tactics, while employing dense
I masses of infantry in small spaces, but
: so far with little success. The net re- I
suit of their efforts had been the gain ;
of a small salient west of Douaumont, i

fact that competition for deposits is

here to look out for its interests among
the Kansas bankers.

here?" was asked one of the dele

ates of interest that should be paid on

We realize that everything we might say
in this connection will probabl.v lie of uo
information to you and possibly of ve;-v
little interest. However, we can't refrain
from making a few remarks on the -. abject.
Practically all the banks iu Topeka. at
least a good number of them, are paying
4 pet cent interest on time deposits to in
dividuals. This they would not do unless
it was profitable to them If it is profit
able to pay individuals per cent on their
lime deposits, it would be equa My profit
able to pay 4 per cent interest on city and
county funds under like circuuiHtitnceH
and conditions. And. again, if the b:: uk.s
can profitably use individuals' money al I
per rent on time deposits there is uo good
reason why they can't pay more rhaii -per
cent to city and county on their daily
bala nces.
state and County funds may legally tie
deposited in any safe banking institution
within the state. Civic pride ami loyalty
to home institutions u sua Ily prevail in
matters of this kind and they are (riven to
banks within tin city and county and state
producing them, which is only fair and
proper.
This civic pride ami loyalty should be re
ciprocal ; that is. if home institutions are
given preferences they should be willing to
pay the usual and prevailing rates of in
terest both on time and on daily balances
'this, indgioji from their concerted and
unanimous action, they aru unwilling to do.

a rea so liable su in. and are will mg to p. - v

The 'entral National bank made a

garding the amounts overdrawn :
"The banks have always charge the
city 6 per cent interest from the time
the warrants are stamped 'unpaid for
want of fundf as long as I have been
in the city hull. The banks cash them
for the school teachers and bring
them to me and I stamp them, giving
them a registered number r.nd date,
and we pay interest from this time till
they are paid by us."
In December, 1914, the amount of
outstanding warrants unpaid for the
want of sufficient funds and paid by
the Topeka banks for which they
charged the city 6 per cent interest,
was $68,1 17.11.
In March. 1915, the unpaid war
rants issued, all bearing 6 per cent,
amounted to $75,745.93.
At the close of December, 1915,
$49,159.20 worth of warrants remained
outstanding and unpaid. All of these
amounts, however, have now been
but, but the city had to pay the banks
6 per cent.

that it wasn't really the cziir after
all; it was the czar's valet who
had passed himself off on Mutt
and Jeff.
