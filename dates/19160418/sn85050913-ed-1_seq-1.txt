ity of her Condition was recognized
several days ago by the family but
the general public had not been ap
prised of the change In her condition
aiid the news of her death comes as
a severe blow to her friends, com
pletely prostrating the immediate

CHEYENE SYSTEM
J5|o^.: City
tS^hoql
Board to Consid-
er High School Military
••.c'
Instruction.
At a receut meeting of the Sioux
City Real Estate Association in Sioux
City, military instruction in the
high school was informally endors
ed. They are desirous of obtaining
more information before discussing
the plan's feasibility as a part of the
national preparedness program,
however.
W. S. Gilman, a member of the
school board, said thqre was no
doubt but that the matter would be
thoroughly considered if public ag
itation demanded it. Other members
of the boata took practically the
same view. School boards all over
the land are considering this ques
tion, which Is regarded by many as
highly Important. It more efficient
ly solves the military defense ques
tion for ten years or less
hence than any other of voluntary,
service. Such training would begin
with the forming of a military comv
pany in the high school, to be affil
iated With the Iowa National Guards
of ^he city, as is the plan in Chey
eng, Wyo.
The Cheyene plan is regarded as
the most efficient of any in the coun
try and is also in use by other large
cities of the state. The plan Is
khown as^ Jthe Wyoming military
school plan. It involves the send
ing of a U. S. army officer to the city
to give military instruction in the
high school and connects the com
pany of high school boys with the
N. G. In the event that connect
ing the boys with the I. N. G. was
disapproved, a private instructor
could be employed and the unit or
ganized *as a private company. Six
ty per cent of the Cheyene high
school afe members of the military
company and instruction is not com
pulsory in any of the high schools.
There is no question but that the
saving of life ia time of this na
tion's warfare, should such a thing
come again, would be greatly height
ened by some early plain training in
regard to the obedience of orders
and the handling of arms. It would
be considered the height of folly to
send a young man out into a forest
infested with wild animals with a
gun upon his shoulder if he knew
nothing of caring for the weapon,
knew not how to load the ftring
piece, or any other tactics of de
fense.
Let parents consider this matter
deeply, for the'day may come when
they will be grateful for some sim­

to be allowed, to join a military com
pany because of the fears of their

A Pjrogram Which WiU Kee$ Every
Industrious Person on the
Jump.
The movement which Is on foot to
have a clean-up week is evidently
the result of the fertile imagination
of some woman. If" there is any
thing in the world that the average
woman likes it Is to clean the house
and yard. When the lady of the
house dons her working clothes, sal
lies forth with a broom in one hand
and dust rag in the other it is notice
to all germs that the day of reckon
ing has come and to the menfolks
about the place that the time to
make sacrifice of all ordinary com
forts has arrived. This year, how
ever, every home and yard issto be
invaded simultaneously and there
will be no place for the average man
to go to escape the turmoil and mis
ery. The ordinary Webster City man
is looking forward to the .carnage
with courage and fortitude and is
preparing himself for the worst.
Wbile the women are busy the man
who survives1 the tlrst onslaughts
may find work for his industrious
hands. It has been suggested that he
might remove the bones carried into
the yard by the neighbor's dog, the
dead branches, blown by the winter's
blast, the hunks of paper from the
careless hand. Next on the program
is the alley which should be tackled
with a strong spirit and a courage
ous hand. Tie a little asafetlda un
der the nose to combat and rout the
other smells that will arise when the
contents of the garbage pile are turn
ed loose on the spring air, and wade
in. Th6 brat way of disposing of the
more offensive elements is by com
bustion. The spring bonfire of com
posite character, wafting the odor of
the burning overshoe, the smoulder
ing incense of the garments that once
clothed the last Thanksgiving tur
key. and the perfume of an over-ripe
cabbage that fell a victim to a too
luxurious cellar, will arouse your
neighbors to retaliatory measures. In
this manner the entire community
will arise to its responsibility and
seeth with odoriferous activity, and
when the deed 1b done, the lilac will
have a fair chance to monopolise the
springtime air.
Wash your windows so that you
can observe the new Easter bonnets
go sailing by. Continue the treat
ment to your auricular appendages,
so that you can hear the birds sing
ing their sweet songs. Clean out
your heart so that you can feel the
glory of living, catch- the aplrlt of
spring and be new and sweet smel-
:r.vp
ling inside and outside.
The governor of Iowa has issued a
letter to the public in regard to the
clean-up campaign as follows:
Tp the People °f Iowa:
"I desire in this public way to call
the attention of the people of the
state to a movement by the Federat
ed Women's Clubs of Iowa to insti
tute what may be known as a "Clean
up Week" beginning April 24th. Six
teen. thousand women are behind the
movement and are inspired only by
an unselfish devotion to the public
welfare. They want to make Iowa
as clean and as wholesome a place to
live in as possible. They are anxious
to bring about higher ideals, better
civic standards, better sanitary con
ditions, to minimize dangers from
fires, to make the homes of the state
and their surroundings more invit
ing and beautiful.
I hope the people of the state
(wlll
co-operate with these women and
help them in every way possible. The
proposition certainly has my unquali
fied endorsement and, I am willing to
give it all the encouragement can
It would be very helpful if the
mayors and newspapers of the cities
and towns of the state would call
special attention to the week to be
devoted to said purposes and urge
that meetings be held in that behalf
and also If the women of the state
would see to it that the purpose and
value of the movement be not lost in
any community."
