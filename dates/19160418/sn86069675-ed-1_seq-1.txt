to catch sales as nearly all were
sold by the head and both sellers

prices, more so than we have ever
known on this market.

STATE BOARD
RECONSIDERS
And Now Says County's Assess
ment Should Be Raised Fifteen
Per Cent.
Some weeks ngo the State Board
of Equalization nt Frankfort, ac
cording to the daily press, announc
ed thnt the assessment of Mont
gomery county would remain un-
changed, about which we expressed
both gratification nnd surprise nt
the time. Since then, the Board
member.-) seem to have had u change
of heart nnd yesterday Judge Chcn
ault received n communication say
ing thnt Montgomery county must
show on May" 17th, why its assess
ment should not be raised fifteen
per cent on Innd, town lots and
personalty. Already our assess
ment is higher than many other
counties in proportion. Tho board
seems to lose sight of the fact that
a great portion of our county is
made up of inferior land nnd not
nil bluegrnss, by any means. Wc
sincerely hope a delegation of re
presentative men will be sent before
the board on the above date and
that a determined fight - will be
made to prevent this unjust and ar
bitrary increase. Instead of in
creasing the people's tnxes, a few
dozen useless offices ought to ,bo
abolished.
WILL HAVE CHARGE OF TRACK
The Montgomery County Fair
Association has closed a deal with Mr.
public school building in Mt. Ster
vork' the track this season nnd
keep it in condition for training
horses. Mr. Bean, together with
his brother, Charles Bean, will train
a stable of horses in the large barn
on the grounds. Tho track is nl-

CIRCUIT COURT
A number of important matters
having been compromised, or con
tinued by agreement, very little
hu-iness has been transacted in
Circuit Court this term. The grand'
jury has adjourned to re-conveno .
Thursday, as has 11N0 Circuit
Court, when some civil cases will ,
be called for trial. The Pergrnni
murder tria.', transferred here from ,
Bath county on n change of venue,
is set for next Monday' nnd it is
thought both sides will announce
ready.
