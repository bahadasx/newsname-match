The Committee Hearing.
The report of the committee hear
ing, referred to by the aenator bears
out hia statement that he advised that
the land be given to settlers. The fol
lowing extract from the published re
port of the committee gtves a line on
(Senator Lanes position:
Mr. Raker What Is your view as
to how the landa ahould be dlapoaed
of to homesteaders'.' Suppose the gov
ernment had Its title clear from the
railroad company, will you state to the
committee how the government should
dispose of them to homesteaders, so
as to treat the company fairly and the
government fairly
Senator lane 1 would allow the
homesteader the right of entry upon
160 acres.
Mr. Raker How would you clas
sify the land
Senator Lane I would give that to
any man who would go In there.
Mr. Raker On the principle ol
first come, first served?
Senator Lane 1 suppose that would
be fair.
In his statement before the com
mittee Senator Lane made clear his
opinion that the railroad company
haa been very unfair to the state of
Oregon and Is entitled to nothing be
yond an equity of $2. So per acre, sug
gested by the supreme court.
In the senator's statement he did
not refer directly to the Chamberlain
bill, providing 40 per cent for the
school fund.
Villa's death or capture. The admin

compllahed an enormous task. The
troops have driven the Villiatas 400
miles into the interior, robbed Villa
of the glory of being the first Mexican
to invade the I'nlted States to kill the
gringoes, checked the likllhood of an
other revolution In northern Mexico,
virtually assured the border aga'nat

GOLD THIEVES RAID

PORTLAND, Ore., April 18. Oper

thieves were centered at Portland
Sunday night
The office of every dentist In the
Pittock block, 60 per cent of those In
the Morgan building and offices in
the Broadway building were entered
by thieves,
The extent of the losses of the den
tists has not been determined, it will
amount to at least 8S000.
Owing to the fact that most of the
dentists robbed know little about how
much sold they had, the total of the
depredations will be extremely diffi
cult. The work is that of a gang which
has been working on the coast for
some time. They began operations in
Salt Lake, and from evidence gathered
by the police there and forwarde'.
both to the police and to dentists
here the gang intended trying other
coast cities. San Francisco was next

BERLIN IS GREATLY AROUSED
Iteport Over Wilson's Latest Note

epts That Message to (Germany Will
go Forward Thursday Although
Further Delay Is Feared.
BERLIN, April IS. It was learned
today that members of the Reichstag
who demanded a more vigorous sub
marine campaign are preparing to
take a hand in the German-American
crisis. They will strongly oppose
further concessions. If necessary they
will break the true arranged recently
and openly criticize the German gov
ernment if it makes Its policies con
form with Wilson's wishes.
The situation has suddenly grown
tense with the receipt of reports that
Wilson has framed a new note with
out waiting for the exhibits which
Von Jagow forwarded. This is be
lieved to corroborate the reports that
the new note is moat drastic. Offici
als are under the pressure of public
opinion which again Is growing hoa
tlle toward America. The success of
the submarine campaign, Inaugurated
in March is a strong argument against
making concessions.
WASHINGTON. April 18 Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
held a final conference at 10 o'clock
this morning over the latest subma
rine note. The communication war
expected to reach Berlin on Thurs
day or Friday." Officials pointed to
the attack on the Russian steamer Ira
perator and the wounding of an Am
erican as an alleged abuse of the law.
Bernstorff arranged for a confer
ence with Lansing at four this after
noon. The German note was read at
the cabinet meeting today. After
wards it appeared possible that the
dispatch of the latest note might be
delayed.
It was learned that the administra
tion's profound hope is to avoid a
break with Germany. The note leaves
a way for Germany to act to preclude
the possibility of a further crisis. The
president cites in his note that it was
not only ships carrying Americans
which were attacked, but neutrals
which were attacked. The cause of
the probable delay was not learned,
though officials hinted there was still
some undetermined elements in the
Issue.

X GAVIRA SAYS REPORT X
OF DEATH OF VILLA 4
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED
EL PASO, April 11. General
Gavira announced today that he
had received confirmation of
Villa's death from Governor En-
rlques of Chihuahua.
Shortly before, General Bell 4
told Funston that he believed
the entire story of finding villa's
body was manufactured In Ju-
area.
SAN ANTONIO, April 18. Advanc
ed American detachments hurried
toward Satevo today. A renewal of
the chase after Villa under a new
plan, with a diminished risk is be
lieved the object of the temporary
lull. Funston said that Americans
could not go beyond Satevo with the
present communication lines. It re
mains with the war department to ob
tain permission to use the Mexican
railroads.
EL PASO. April IS. Hunting for
Villa became a secondary matter with
the military authorities today. The
protection of the American expedi
tion was the main thing. Pershing is
understood to have told Funston. Fol
lowing the Parral clash and the Mex
ican request for a withdrawal of
troops, the safety of the troopa be
came uppermost In the minds of
army men.
Pershing has returned to Nami-
quipa, midway along the communica
tion lines, to watch the situation more
closely. If the exhumed corpse la not
Villa, neither the Americans nor the
Mexicans have an adequate idea of
his whereabouts, it was admitted. The
Mexicans claimed that the telegraph
wires are down, preventing the receipt
of further Information. The failure
to quickly produce the body for Iden
tification has increased skepticism,
intervention advocates, anxious to
prevent withdrawal, circulated exag
gerated and alarming reports of the
destruction of American property in
Chihuahua.
Consul Rodgers at Mexico City, re
ported that Carranxa is disposed to
stand pat on the withdrawal sugges
tion until he receives a formal reply.
Carranxa is not incl'ned to discuss the
matter further, pending the arrival of
a reply.
Army chief3 at El Paso, refusing
to be quoted, privately expressed the
opinion that nobody below Juarez ev
er heard of the discovery of Villa's
body. The Enrique report Is Indefi
nite Latest advices were similar to
Sunday's messages regarding the
hody. Gavira stated that the Enri
quex message strengthened the be
lief that Villa's career had ended and
that the expedition was practically
over. Local mining Interests received
message from Cuelhulrachlc which
fulled to mention the finding of the
corpse.
