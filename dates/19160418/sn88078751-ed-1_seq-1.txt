camo frojn several Bources. First,
Oarranea officials received messages
from San Antonio and Madera, both
la the state of Chihuahua. Later a
private message from San Antonio,
Chihuahua, confirmed tho finding of
tho body and gave the details. This
nessago said that a former Villa col
onel, captured by General Cavzos, a
Carranza commander, offered, if' his
Hfo was-spared, to show where Villa
was buried. The offer was accepted
and he led a command under Colonel
Carlos Carranza, nophew of tho first

death had resulted from gangrene, as
a result of a gunshot wound in the
left knee. The body was being brought
to "Ban Antonloi to bo taken to Chi
huahua City and then to Juarez, the
message said.
Audres Garcia. Carranza consul in
El Poso, as soon as he received the
first report of the, capture of Villa,
sent a telegram to Governor Guiter
rez of the state of Chihuahua asking
him to have the body of Villa sent to
Juarez that Americans might view it
and satisfy themselves of the death
of the batuKt.
Villa's Last Hours.
The story of the location of tho
body tallies witli that of a week ago
regarding the death of Villa. It was
elated at that time that he died some
where in the vicinity of San Antonio
or Satovo, and had been buried on a
ranch. One of tho Mexican inform
ants of General Pershing's men at tho
time said he could point out the gravo,
but it is not known if he was given a
chance to do so or not.
That the bandit chief suffered great
agony before his death is reported
from many sources. This was con
firmed when a party of seven Mexi
cans reached Juarez and said that
they had escaped from Villa at Sa
tevo, at which time he was believed
tr- be dying, but was riding night and
day cursing the Americans in one
breath and crying out in pain in an
other. These men were being held
prisoners by Villa, they said, but as
death drew nearer and his men were
c".iiven off Into various small bands
tj the continued attacks of the Amer
ican and Carranza troops ho was un
able to guard his prisoners 'and they
ercaped.
One of the men after learning the
story that the body of Villa had been
dug up and Identified said: "We
know when we left Villa that he could
not live. His leg had swollen so largo
that his trousers leg had been cut
ojien. The wound was an ugly, gap
ing one, full of pus and pieces o!
broken bone, which were protruding.
He had only tho services of a native
doctor when shot."
A second private message from
San Antonio, Metf, arrived in Juarez
stating that tho body of Pancho Villa
had been exhumed and wns being
brought to that place. The message
snld tho body would bo taken immedi
ately to Chihuahua City.

C. Brown and his black troopers of

an engagement of some character
Thursday evening at a point north of
Parral In which city they fought with
the civilian populace on Tuesday last
Tho colonel sent a message from a
roint north of Parral to American
Consul Letcher in Chihuahua, asking
that an aeroplane be sent him that
he might report.
Colonel Brown did not state the na
ture of his trouble, but it is feared
that ho had a clash with Carranza
forces. Since it was Colonel Brown's
force that was in Parral Wednesday
there was speculation as to why he
had retired north when his route was
impposed to be south. Either "no ran
out of food and had to return north,
or was forced to retire in face of su
perior numbers, nrmy men were In
clined to bolieve.
Twenty bandits attacked tho Unit
ed States nrmy supply train twenty
miles north of Satovo, but were re
pulsed. One of tho bandits was killed
and several wounded. None of the
Americans were injured. General
Pershing was personally with tho
train when attacked.
Blotlne took place in the City o:

ceived in Juarez. Thirty former Vil
Ustns were placed under arrest as a
result of' the rioting.

BATTLE IN ITS NINTH WEEK
Estimated That Nearly 400,000 Men
Have Been Eliminated in the Great

mans Calculated at One Hundred
Square Miles Operations On the
Battle Fronts.
Paris, April 17. Another counter
attack in the region south of Douau-
mont, on the east bank of the Mouse,
was successfully carried out by the
French. German trench elements,
against which the attack was direct
ed, were captured, and 200 prisoners,
Including two officers, were taken.
The battle of Verdun has entered
upon its ninth week.
The lull in the German offensive in
the Verdun region, which has been
Interpreted as indicating elaborate
preparations for a resumption of the
attack, still continues. No attempt
has been made at an advance by tho
German infantry, but the German
heavy artillery directed a heavy bom
tardment against the B0I3 d'Avocourt
end Hill .104. against which the Ger
mans have directed much of their en
ergy recently.
In no previous battles have the
losses been so high as these which
have been estimated in the fighting
around Verdun. These estimates, how
ever, can not be regarded as condu
cive, for reither Germany nor France
has announced its own casualties. The
French war office has declared the
Germans have lost 200.000 in killed,
-wounded and captured. The Germans
state seim-offic'ally that the French
casualties number I.'O.OOO killed and
mounded and that 3R.000 unwoundod
French prisoners have been taken. If
these estimates are approximately
correct, nearly 400,000 men have been
eliminated as fighting units.
The ground occupiel by the Ger
mans after fifty-six days of fighting
iray be roughly calculated as 100
square miles. They have forced back
the French from their outlying posi
tion to their definite line of resistance
along the semi-circle front from the
edge of the Argonne eastward across
the Meusa and southward into the
Woevre. For the most part this main
line has withstood the shock of suc
cessive attacks.
Complete Success.

CREDENCE
IS
At Washington To Report Of
Villa's Death
Many Believe Mexican Story of
Villa's Death True,
PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO ACT.
Will Withdraw Troops From Mexlc
When Body of the Outlaw Is Iden
tified Positively by American Offi
cials State and War Departments
Awaiting Intelligence From United
States Consular Agents.
Washington, April 17. Administra
tion officials declare that American
troops will be withdrawn from Mex
ico immediately if it Is shown that
Francisco Villa is dead. Reports
ol the bandit chief's death reaching
El Paso and other border points were
forwarded to Washington for In
fo: mation, but neither American con
suls nor military authorities in Mex
ico were heard from.
There was no attempt here to dis
guise officials' eager interest In the re
ported killing of the bandit. Every
message received was closely scrutin
ized at the state department and sent
to the White House. In some quarters
there was a disposition to credit
them, despite the fact that border re
ports generally have been viewed
v.ith so much suspicion since tho pur
suit began.
Officials would not discuss what
proof they would deem necessary to
establish the fact the body mentioned
In these reports Is that of Villa. It is
certain, however, that every effort
will be made to obtain so complete an
Identification as to make sure beyond
reasonable doubt that the man. who
waged war with a few hundred ban-
I dits against the United States and tho-
fie facto goternraent of Mexico simul
taneously had paid the penalty. Con
sul Letcher at Chihuahua should bo
able to make the identification.
Customs Collector Cobb at El Paso
informed the state department that
Mexican- customs officials at Juarez
had told him the body of the bandit
had been found and would be taken
to Chihuahua City.
The Mexican embassy received this
messaee from Mexican Consul Garcia
j at El Paso "The telecraph operators
at Cuslhuriachio and Madera have In
formed mo that thev have found the
lody of Francisco Villa and that '.t
will be conducted to Chihuahua.''
