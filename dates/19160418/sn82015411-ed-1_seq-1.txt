PROGRESS OF THE
SOCCER SERIES
The battalion soccer series is
now half completed, unless a third
Sunday should be taken up by a
game between the winners of the
regular series and Company D
team.
The hospital corps and 1st, Bat
talion met at Lihue on April 9th,
when the latter were beaten by a
score of 3-0. Lieut, Avery refereed.
On the same date the 3rd. Battalion
defeated the 2nd. Battalion at Ele
ele, scoring 3-0, Captain Crowell
referring,
Last Sunday saw the 1st. Batta
lion defeated bv the 3rd. to the
tune of 4-1, on the Lihue field.
Through apparent lack of esprit-de-corps
on the part of some of the
members of the home team, their
non-appearance on the field not
only delayed the game considera
bly, "out prevented the team from
doing itself full justice.
The 2nd. Battalion lost to the
Hospital Corps last Sunday a t
Eleele field; score 4 0. Refereed
by J. Fernandes,
Next Sunday the schedule will
be as follows:

FINE PROGRAM BY
FIRST BATTALION
The concert and entertainment
given last Saturday by the First
Battalion at Lihue Social Hall was
voted a complete success in every
respect.
The first part of the evening
was devoted to a concert program,
each item of which wns very pleas
ingly rendered.
Mrs. Mary A. Rice sang "The
Four Leaed Clover" very charm
ingly and Miss Waterhouse rend
ered "My Laddie'' most pleasing
ly. Mrs. H. T. Sheldon, Miss
Poepoe and Miss Jacobson sang two
very sweet Haw nan songs "Malu
hia" and "Kuu Lei Mokihana."
The"Austriau Imperial Hymn,"
rendered as a violin solo bv Cop
tain Carden, brought forth much
applause, while Lieut. Horner's
clever work at the piano was equal
ly appreciated. A ladies' quar
tett and the Nawiliwili string band
rounded out a very pleasing pro
gram; at the close ot which the
audience was invited to take seats
outside where motion films were
shown on an outdoor screen by
Mr. W. Fernandez. While these
progressed, the hall was cleared
for dancing, the regimental band,
under the able direction of Band
master Souza, and the Nawiliwili
quartett, furnishing delightful mu
sic until the hour of midnight.
Approximately $300.00 were
realized through ticket sales and
other sources.
The officers of the First Batta
lion wish to express their sincere
thanks to all who so willingly par
ticipated in making the affair suc
cessful in every way.
E
T
Governor Pinkham and Mr. Lar
rison quietly depatted Saturday
afternoon for Honolulu, after hav
ing spitit a little more than a week
on the island.
The sum total of the Governor's
accomplishments here seems t o
have been the signing up of six
cane crop agreements between
homesteadersand the -Li' tie Planta
tion Co. and seventy-four between
homesteaders and the Makee Sug
ar Company. These are all for
five vears each, and will be ap
proved in due course by the exec
utive. The water matter and franchise
questions were left over, the Gov
ernor stating that the former would
have to await the development of
a general policy to apply to the
entire Territory, and the latter
would have to be taken up by the
Attorney-General.
The Governor seemed to be
quite well satisfied with the re
sults of his mission, stating before
he left that the visit had probably
resulted in a better understanding
all around.
Garden Island's Car
On account of difficulties en
countered in the effort to secure a
regular wireless and paper deliv
ery on the route between Lihue
and Kekaha, Tinj Gakdkn Island
has purchased and put it's own
car on that run. The car is num
ber 204. and will leave the office
in Lihue not later than 12 o'clock
noon each day, going straight
through to Kekaha, with stops at
various towns only long enough to
leave the papers. This is a verv
expensive undertaking, but is in
fulfillment of the ptoinise to de
liver thejdaily and weekly regu
larly and promptly.
PROMOTERS
HERE TOMORROW
All of the members of the Ha
waii Promotion Committee and a
few assistants will arrive on Kauai
tomorrow morning to make a tour
of this island.
The committee has asked Jfor a
session with the Chamber of Com
merce, and it has been decided to
turn the regular meeting of the
Chamber, in the county building
at Lihue Thursday afternoon, over
to that purpose. It is expected
that this meeting will be very large
ly attended, as the session with
the Promotion Committee is sure
to prove interesting and valuable.
The committee is visiting the
outer islands under its new plan
of studying each island on the
ground. Hawaii and Maui have
alreidy been visited, toured thor
oughly and interesting sessions
held with the commercial bodies
of those islands. The same- pro
gram is planned for Kauai.
While nothing definite has come
to that effect, it is assumed that
Cyril O. Smith, the new Kauai
member of the committee, will ac
companv the party. E A. Berndt
is the chairman. The presumption
is that the members of the com
mittee from Hawaii and Maui will
also be along, although nothing
definite lias been stated in regard
to this.
Regarding the tour the secretary
of the committee, in a letter re
ceived from Honolulu this morn
nig, has the following to say
"The Hawaii Promotion Com
mittee, at its meeting vesaerday,
decided upon Tuesday, April 18th.
as the date of its departure for
Kr.uai Island, landing at Nawili
wili Wednesday morning, April
19th. and returning say Friday
evening April 21st. This will give
us Wednesday, Thursday and Fri
day to acquaint ourselves with
Kauai's tourist attractions, its
roads and transportation, and to
officially meet with the Chamber of
Commerce and possibly the Board
of Supervisors, both of which have
an interest in 'the appointment of
the Kauai member on the Promo
tion Committee.
"We have not ourselves mapped
out and particular itinerary, but
wc will leave it to you to select a
time when we shall be able to meet
with the Kauai Chamber of Com
merce add discuss with them offi
cial promotion matters as they af
fect Kauai and to receive sugges.
tions from the Kauai Chamber of
Commerce which may result in a
larger tourist travel to the Garden
Island.
"I presume the committee will
want to go to Waimea and see the
points of interest along that route
as well as to enter the big canyon
there at least part way, and pos
sibly go up towards Hanalei. This
is the first visit of the promotion
Committee as a bodv to the Gar
den Island and will complete our
business visits to the outer islands
as required by the Chamber of
Commerce of Honolulu bv-laws."
An Accident Case
The Kauai Industrial Accident
Board held a two-hour session in
the county buildiu? last night to
hear the case of one Okumura, a
sub-contractor getting out rock
for the county at Kealia. In con
nection with the matter letters
from the Japanese consul were
read After due Ihearing the case
was thrown out of court for want
of jurisdiction, the man proving
I not to be- a laborer within the
meaning of the law. It is under
'sstood that tie county will nukt
some provision for the man.

Oahu will have a central battery of big guns for protection. Six
12-inch rifles will be included in it, so placed as to defend the shore-
line.
Deadlocked
Washington The conference committee of the t-tmite and House
appears unable to agree on the free sugar clause, and a deadlock has
been on all day, with apparently little chance of reaching a comprom
ise. Senator Simmons predicted that the result of the conference
would probably be a report that the conferees could not agree.
Yuan Tries For Peace
Tokio Yuan is making a last attempt to avert final overthrow.
He is organizing a new cabinet in the hope of winning peace from
the revolutionists Former Minister Ling Tung Yu may be a cabinet
member.
Chinese in the United States are striving hard to balk the efforts
of Yuan to negotiate a big loan.
Teutons Attack Again
London The Teutons launch another attack against Verdun and
are stopped. Terrific infantry assaults between the Meuse and Douau
mont ate checked, except at one point in a neighboring wood where a
ain was made.
Artillery is attacking French positions.
Russians Defeat Drive
The great offensive of the Austro Germans against Dvina and
Ikskull has been defeated by Russians.
The Slavs have approached nearer to Trepizond.
Aviation Service Shaken Up

The Case
The death of Villa has not yet
The nearest approach to a corroboration of the storv tbrt the body of
the bandit had been exhumed comes from Major Hawes, U. S. A,.
who states that the outlaw had been. seen in the neighborhood of the
reputed grave.
An official announcement by Carranza that Villa is dead will be
accepted by this government, and will be followed by the withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico.
Sussex Raider Captured
London The raider which sunk the Sussex has been captured.
The French government says the capture was made by a French
warship.
Recruiting In England
Recruiting is once mare acute throughout England. Newspaper?

Last German Note
Washington The President's late note to Germany has been
finally completed. The contents are said to be the most emphatic
ever written by Mr. Wilson.
Another Army Bill Killed
Washington The amended armv bill has been defeated in the
Senate. Three of these bills have so far been beaten and more are to
be considered.
Yon Pappen Again
New York Captain von Papen, former attache of the German
government at Washington, has been indicted here on a charge of
being concerned in a plot to blow up or damage the Panama Canal.
Monday Afternoon
Washington The report that General Villa is dead as the result
of wounds received in battle is still unconfirmed. In official circles there
is an open disbelief of the rumors. Hours pass without confirmation
of the story and without any reports from United States official sourc
es to lend color to the rumor.
Washington grows more anxious and doubtful of the authentic
ity of the report. Consul Letcher, who is at Chihuahua, forwarded
no rumor here, indicating that he places no reliance in the report.
San Antonio No report to Geneial Funston from General Per
shing regarding the rumor that General Villa's body had been located.

Washington D. C. March 26.
The House Committee on Teiri
tories has reported favorably upon
the bill authorizing the establish
ment of an electric light and power
plant within the Lihue and Koloa
districts, Knuai. The committee
suggests some minor amendments
to the bill and in its report .Kays:
This is a bill to authorize a com
pany to supply and distribute elec
tric light and power in two dis
tricts on Jhe island of Kauai, Ter
ritory of Hawait.
The entire population in these
two districts, including orientals,

Your committee have, however,
had amendments made and offered
to the original franchise act pass
ed bv the Hawaiian Legislature in
1913, embodying the same safe
guards to the public that have been
attached to the more valuable
franchise of a similar character in
Honolulu.
The bill reported herewith is a
