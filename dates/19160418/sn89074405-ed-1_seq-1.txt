it was "Dorothy Arnold."
Warden Davis said last night that

of the matter becoming public. The
warden thought the man was seeking

to ask a private detective agency in

The resolution says:
"The presbytery of New York being

Furth­
Guarded by Latest
Ruling.
Washington. April. IS.—Regulations
governing the issuance of passports
are' made mors stringent by an ex

Pre^dent Wilson. Although there
has been a decided abatement of com
plaints of the misuse of American
passports, state department officials
say their lssuanoe will be still furth
er guarded by the order without ap
plicants being submitted to undue In
convenience.
Three important changes are made
by the order. It provides:
First, that the certificate of a clerk
of a state court as to the identity of
an applicant will not be aocepited if a
federal court Is within easy access.
Second, that only such state courts
as under existing law are privileged
to grant applications for a naturalisa
tion will be recognised as qualified to
certify to the identity of passport ap
plicant*
Third, that commercial, travelers
and other persons Whose business in
volves frequent trips to Europe here
after may have their passports re
newed upon the basts or their orig
inal application instead of being re
quired to secure newv. passports for
trip. '•r

Washington, April 18.—Secretary

From the state department and the
president, the cabinet received an out

American troops.
A decision' as to what course now
to pursue will be reaohed between the
military and diplomatic aspects of the
situation.
Funston's dispatches came last
night and are the fullest discussion of
his problems he yet hss submitted.
They contain no mention' of the re
ported death of Villa. It was only a
hint of their contents that Secretary
Baker would reveal. The substances
of the metfsages .'the. secretary said,

Importance of improving their seed
for the year of 1917 is called by H. L.
Bolley, of the state agricultural col
lege, in a bulletin just issued.
Prof. Bolley. pure seed commission
er for the state, declares that the
proper time to take steps to improve
the seed supply for 1917, is the pres
ent. The use of clean seed at this
time, on clean soil, is urged, and he
advises care in the selection of this
year's seed that a good crop of seed
for next year may be assured.
GOVERNMENT NOT
TO BACK LOAN
New York, April 18.—The impend
ing French loan, it was authoritatlvely
learned yesterday, will not be backed
by any obligation of the French gov
ernment. The collateral that will un
derlie the loan, whose amount and
Interest rate are yet to be determined,
will consist of securities of neutral
countries.
In effect the French government is
endeavoring to mobilize securities in
these neutral countries in much the
same' manner that the British treas
ury mobilized American' securities.
Delay in the completion of negotia
tions is partly due to the fact that
the securities to be so mobilized are
not pawable or negotiable in dollars
as Is most of the collateral which the
British government has been utilising
to effect further commercial credits
and stabilize sterling exchange in this
country.

REPORT MANUFACTURED, SAYS BELL.
San Antonio, April 18.—General Bell, reporting from
El Paso to Funston, gave it as his opinion, after as thor
ough an investigation as he could make, that the report of
Villa's death had been manufactured in Juarez. Consul
Letcher, who said he had been in communication with
Cusihuiriachic, also has failed to verify the report.
Cainp of General Pershing at Front, April 18.—The American pur
suit of Villa is at a standstill because of tlie unprovoked attack upon
American cavalrymen by Insubordinate soldiers of the Carranza garri
son at Parrall.
At General Pershing's headquarters, there seemed to be no prospects
of a resumption of the chase while there are numerous Indications
thai a continuation of the pursuit would meet with armed resistance.
AMERICAN OFFICERS FIRED UPON.
A small party of American officers were fired upon near hers
Sunday night, none of the Americans being Injured. This, coming on
the heels of other reports of sniping, Is responsible for the belief that
the expeditionary command is confronted with a serious problem.
Tlie report received here from Carranza sources that a Villa col
onel. captured near Ouslbnlrlachlc. had promised to lead the party tn
the grave in which Villa is said to have been buried last Friday, is gen
erally discredited by military authorities here.
CALdj IT MEXICAN VICTORY.
Newspapers published In Chihuahua reached here containing re
ports of the attack upon the command of Major Tompkins at Parral.
According to these, the Americans were encamped In Plaaa De
Juan, when, despite the efforts of Carranza officials, the Mexlcsa popu
lace attacked them with fire arms, whereupon the cavalrymen fought
back.
TOe affair is described as being a ifinlnr of the Americans, since
they retired finally to Lammos.

VILIjA HAS CHANCE TO ESCAPE.
San Antonio, April 18.—If Villa is not dead, he has an excellent
opportunity to escape Into territory far beyond the most advanced lines
of the American detachments because the punitive force has penetrated
about as far south as it is going with the present organization.
Official admission that, it is Impossible to extend the main lino, of
communication south of SaU.vo Is taken to mean that the field of
operations would he restricted to that district, over which detachments
of cavalry with provisions for one or two days, oould ride. Beyond-tbe
arc of that fan, Villa would be safe so far as the Americans are con
cerned.

Defacto Soldiers in Need of

thousand of General Arnulfo Gomez'
men concentrated at Colonia Morslos
and the south are in danger of starv

Chihuahua, according to an Ameri

officers and men say that was their
intention soon as General Gomes join

They made no secret of the
meagreness of their food supply, some
asking him if he' had any provision*
with him. It is his opinion that they
will not be able to support them-'
selves if they moved into Chihuahua,
a section which is practically stripped
for food by Mexican and American
soldiers. He r.vs told by some of the
officers that no other wagons than the
four now in operation could be pro
