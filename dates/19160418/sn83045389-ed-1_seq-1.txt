station, when it was run dow n by the I
? Jilt Kdce Kxpress. bound from l>os- I
ton to New York.
This conch was telescoped, set a tire'
and burned. Tin- car ahead also took,
tire, and the flames communicating to
the passenger station and freight ware- 1
house, destroyed both buildings. A hos-|
pital train arrived from New London,;
and Modioal Kxainlner M. II. San Ion, !

could be had. \s the tliimes of the

The only telegrai h linos in the town
went down with the burning station. '
and the only couim>>nicati'<u with the i
outsirlo was by a telephone wire. Mver
this help was suitimonoil from I'rovi
de.tice and New I.oiulon, the former
sending a wreckit^ ti.iin and phy
sicians. and th6 latter *cit\ dispatching,
a wrecking train.
The n.'iniber of dend could not be il. fl-!
nitely determined at midnight The,
burning cars were still so hot that
they eould not be thoroughly searched.
Four bodies wore removed early, ami
a count of those who received emer
gency medical treatment snowed thai
thirty-live who eseaped death were in-t
Jiii'Cil. Several of these would die, it
was thought. A brakemau of the localj
train said that there wcr? thirty-Move a
passengers in tin roar car, and that ?
he hail been able to locate only seven I
of these. This gave rise to Iti,-. report
that t hirt> persons had been Killed, hut
later investigation threw do il?t on this'
estimate. A report that thirty bodies
had been recovered later was ili>- '
proved There was still doubt as to J
wltat the search of the ruins, which!
was being conducted, would develop. 1
The belief that thirt ?? persons had
been burned or crushed to death was
expressed by a member of the wrecking
crew. but his opinion was not uen- '
