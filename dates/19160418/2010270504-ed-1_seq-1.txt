Notice
There has been much uneasiness of
mind nmong our peoplo for fear of a
general epidemic of dlphtherlil and
while there have been two or three
cases of this dread dlscaso I can as
sure the publio that with care thcro Is
no danger of an epMemlc. There have
been, In my opinion, a number of cases
denominated diphtheria that are only
aggravated cases of throat trouble
such as tonsllltls and quinsy, and the
public should be cautioned against the
use of anti-toxin whero such Is tho
case, becauso It creates additional ag
gravation of tho existing troubles nnd
then you have to cure tho dlscaso nB
well as tho aggravation which you
cause, and so it is an expense to tho
human economy as well as to tho
pocketbook (Increasing calls) as well
as sometimes resulting In death.
There was a so-called case of diph
theria In the country of wide Interest
and discussioif: On examination I
could find no evidence of diphtheria, so
I sent an Inoculated tubo to tho labor
atory of tho State Board of Health
and had them telegraph their findings.
Their i telegram reads: "Diphtheria
Negative." I also sent swahblngB
from throat and an Inoculated tubo of
serum to the Abbott laboratories of
Chicago, 111., and their telegram
reads: "No Klcbbs Loeffler bacilli
found diphtheria negative," showing
conclusively tlmt this was not a case of
diphtheria and should not have been
treated as siuch.
