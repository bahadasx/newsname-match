Prestemt Whea Me Note.
The President spent aoe hours yester
day petting the note in final form. He
has written the note himself though it
will bear the signature of Secretary of
State rAning.
The Presldent nete serves notice on
Germany. in unmistakable terms. that
the United States demands protection for
American lives on the high seas. Ac
cumulative evidence in advanced to show
that Germany has not accorded this pro
tection.
Specifc instances. including the case of
the channel packet Sussex. are cited to
show that Germanys pledges to the
United States have not been kept. The
whole tenor of the note shows that Ger
many's present methods of submarine
warfare imply violation of these pledges
and the laws of humanity.
Sixty-five specific cases of submarine
attacks on merchantmen since the Lust
tana disaster form the piata upon which
the President bases his indietment of
Qersmay for violating interhational law.
