NEXT WEEK
Senator Montgomery Says He Will
Formally Get Into Race for Con
gress in 8th, at That Time
Senator Charles F. Montgomery,
of Liberty, stopped by in Stanford
a few minutes Monday morning en
route from his' home to Frankfort,
where he is attending the sessions of
the .senate which is trying the im
peachment charges against County
Judge J. E. Williams, of McCreary
j county. He talked with friends here
' regarding his race for the Democrat-
ic nomination for Congress. Senator
Montgomery stated that his formal
announcement as a candidate will be
made next week, and that -he is great
ly pleased with the strong assurances
of support he is receiving from all
over the district. He said that as
soon as his formal announcement is
made, he will inaugurate a speaking
campaign and endeavor during the
three and a half months which will
elaPse before the primary is held
! the first Saturday in August to speak
j in every scno1 house in the district
and to shake the hands of as many
democrats as is possible. Senator
Montgomery said that already many
of his friends over this district are
! making organizations for him in
' their counties and are telling him
that his prospects are splendid all
over the district.
From here Senator Montgomery
went to Danville, where he remain-
' ed a few hours, meeting friends and
advising leading democrats of his
, candidacy. The Danville Advocate

SPECIAL COMMITTEE NAMED
To Look Over Field and Recommend
New Pastor at Danville.
At the formal congregational meet
ing of the Danville Christian church
held Sunday, the action of the Offi
cial Board in accepting The resigna
tion of Dr. H. C. Garrison, was ap
proved, since it was shown that Dr.
Garrison earnestly desired it to be
done. The church also approved the
appointment by the board and the
deacons of a special committee the
purpose of which shall be to look
over the field with a view of secur
ing a new pastor. Relations between
Dr. Garrison and his congregation
will not be finally severed until fall,
however, it isf the expectation,
which will give him ample time to
make arrangements to move to a
more congenial clime, and at the.
same time give the church's special
committee ample leisure to weigh
well the qualifications of those who
may be considered for the vacancy
in the pastorate. The special com
mittee which will have this duty in
hand is composed of several of the
best known and most prominent
members of the Danville congrega
tion. Mr. Gus Rogers is chairman
of the committee and the other mem
bers are Messrs. Richard Cobb, Jas.
H. Baughman, L. C. Bosley, and J.
A. Robinson.
WANT OIL ON THE STREETS
e Block of Business Men Prove
Themselves Very Progressive
The merchants and business men
on the block between Depot street
and Mill street are among the most
progressive in Stanford. Seeing lit
tle chance for oiling of the streets
unless something heroic is done, Pro
prietor E. C. Jordan, of the St. Asaph
hotel, circulated a subscription pa
per among the business men on the
block, and secured the signatures of
nearly all of them to a sufficient
amount to put down oil. The grease
was applied last week and when the
high wind hits town all of the rest
suffer except those business men on
that block. Plans are said to be un
der way by which the Woman's Club
and the City Council may through
co-operation secure necessary funds
to oil the- whole" IWlfiarVan
improvement which is felt to be al
most a necessity since the benefits
of oiling were so clearly demonstra
ted last summer and the citizens and
taxpayers will undoubtedly approve
any legitimate steps taken to secure
funds to oil the AYholal city.

CENTRE COLLEGE
TO PLAY HERE
Undefeated Stanford High School
Nine to Go Against Fast Com
pany Here Friday.
The Stanford High School base
ball team has been sweeping all op
position before so far this season,
having won every game played to
date. Hustonville has been beaten
twice, the Deaf boys twice, and at
Mt. Vernon Saturday the mountain
eers were taken into camp by the
tight score of 10 to 9, n a game re
plete with errors and weird plays.
The real contest of the season, will
come here Friday, however, when the
strong Centre College team of Dan
ville will cross bats with the local
high school lads. Centre has a strong
aggregation of ball tossers this sea
son and of course, on dope, should
figure to put it all over the high
school lads, who are much younger
and less experienced in the great
national pastime. The local team
this season, however is far above the
average and will put up the game of
its life, and the Centre nine will find
that it has no easy picking to de1
feat it. Additional interest will be
given the game by reason of the fact
that Spalding Hill, an old Stanford
High man, is playing third base on
the Centre team this season and is
said to be distinguishing himself by
his fast work. Already much inter
est has been aroused in the forth
coming game, for this is the first time
in many years that Centre's Varsity
team has condescended, to come to
Stanford for a game with the high
school team. The Mt. Vernon team
will play here Wednesday against
Stanford.
The box scores of the two games
against the Deaf boys follow. In
the second game played here, Gover
held them hitless and put up a fine
exhibition in the box. The scores:

'Babe" DeBorde Passes Away at His
Home In East End Friday Af

The death of Leon C. DeBorde at
Crab Orchard last Friday night came
as a great shock and source of sin
cere regret and grief to the host of
friends of this popular young man
both in the East End and here where
he lived a number of years ago.
Known to his friends and relatives
for years as "Babe," few more pop
ular young men had ever been rear
ed in the East End. Genial, whole
souled, companionable, a steadfast
friend always, Vo know him was to be
his friend and it was true that they
were numbered by his acquaintances.
Years ago when his father, the late
J Col. George DeBorde, was jailer of
the county, the young man lived in
j Stanford, and many of the men now
I who were boys at that time, will al
jways have a tender spot in their
hearts for "Babe," who was a gen
jeral favorite with all. From his
rsplendid father, he inherited his un
compromising Demdcracy, and his
party had few more effective work
ers or champions in the East End of
the county than he.
The deceased was only 30 years
of age, but for years had been a vic
tim of asthmatic rheumatism, and
death came as a relief to his tortured
frame. He bore his sufferings brave
ly, however, and few realized how
much he was suffering at times. He
was the youngest child of the fam
ily and the favorite of all. His bro
thers and sisters are Jailer George
F. DeBorde, of this city, John and
Henry DeBorde, of Crab Orchard,
Misses Salile and Bettie DeBorde, of
Crab Orchard, and Mrs. Holdam Stu
art, of Long Beach, Cal.
An immense throng attended tha
funeral services of this popular
young man held at the family home
Sunday afternoon. Brief yet im
pressive services were conducted by
J." C. McClary, after which the mor
tal remains were laid to rest in Crab
Orchard cemetery. The pallbearers
were Charley Buchanan, James G.
Herrin, Thomas H. Bronaugh, J. M.
Collier, Clyde Morgan and Ed Dye
house. ROUT BISHOP.
Miss Mary E. Rout, of the Peyton's
Well neighborhood, who has been vis
iting her cousins, Mrs. W. B. and
Miss Sallie Hawkins at Corbin, for
several weeks, was married in the
parlors of the Hotel Atkin, in Knox
ville, Wednesday morning, to Mr.
Samuel Bishop, Sr., of the same sec
tion of Lincoln county. The Rev.
Roy G. Henderson, of the Fifth ave
nue Presbyterian church performed
the ceremony, which was a beautiful
and impressive one. The happy cou
ple left on the evening's train for
the groom's home, near McCormack's
church. Mrs. Bishop is the only
daughter of the late W. G. Routt and
is a woman of charming personalty.
She will indeed be a help to the man
of her choice.
