OF VILLA DEATH
Nothing Official Backs Up
Story That Body of the
Bandit Is Found
PLENTY OF DOUBTERS
ALONG THE BORDER
[Troops to Be Withdrawn
If Claims of Carranza
Are Proved True
El Paso, Tex., April 17.—A tele
graphic dispatch was received by Gen.
Gavira, commander of the Juarez gar
rison, from Cusihuiriachic at 10:30
o'clock this morning stating that the
body of Francisco Villa had not ar
rived there at this hour.
Gen. Gavira talked today with the
telegraph operator at San Antonio
and obtained further details of the re
ported finding of Villa's body.
According to the San Antonio oper
ator, on last Saturday Gen. Cavazos
and Col. Carlos Carranza, who were
at Cusl, received information that a
Villa band was operating in the neigh
borhood. Two Carranza officers with
a body of men hurriedly left Cusl and
engaged the Villa bandits in a combat
In which many of Villa's followers
were killed and wounded and some
were captured.
A Villa eolonel was among the cap
tured. He begged for his life and
promised to lead his captors to the
grave of the bandit if they would not
kill him.
The operator, at San Antonio said
that Gen. Gavazoe and Col. Carranza
were taken by the prisoner to San
Francisco Borja, where the body is
reported to have been unearthed.
The operator gave no further infor
mation to Gen. Gavira other than that
Villa was wounded on March 27. He
did not know the date of the bandit's
death.
Gen. Gavira said that as soon as he
was advised the body of Villa had
been brought to Cusl he would tele
graph Minister of War Obregon re.
questing that the body be brought to
Juarez. Gen. Gavira said Villa would
not be given a military funeral but
he would be burled as a bandit In.the
Juarez potter's field.
DOUBT 18 FELT.
El Paso, Tex., April 17.—Confirma
tion of Mexican reports that Francis
co Villa's body had been exhumed at
Ban Francisco Borja and was being
brought to Chihuahua was still lack
ing at the headquarters of the de
faoto government at Juares today.
Col. Carlos Carranza, a nephew of
General Carrania, has reported the
finding of Villa's body.
Gabriel Gavira, commander of the
Juarez garrison, awaited Information
from official sources, that would dis
pel any question of doubt over the
reports of the finding of the bandit's
body but no messages regarding
,Vllla were received.
"I still feel reasonably certain that
the message received Sunday over
the Mexican land lines that Villa's
body had been found is correct," said
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul here,
today. "I shall make every effort to
have the body brought to Juarez,
where scores of Americans who knew
him may make an identification that
will be completely satisfactory to the
American people. We should have
some official Information about the
Villa reports today."
Little Information.
De facto government officials were
not able to give any information re
garding an unofficial dispatch from
Mexico City stating that Minister of
War Obregon had announced that
Villa's body was burled at San Fran
cisco Borja and was not en route to
Chihuahua City.
Official word from Washington that
the TJ. S. troops would be immediate
ly withdrawn from Mexico if Villa
was dead will undoubtedly result in
expediting the efforts of the de facto
government-to ascertain the truth of
the reports of the locating of Villa's
body and to make a full and satisfy
ing identification. If the supposed
body of the bandit is still interred at
San Francisco Borja, as stated in lat
est Mexico City advices, it will likely
khe
HI­
many days before an identiflca
on can be made unless the Mexican
government accepts as final the iden
tification made by Carranza officers
now In the vicinity of San Francisco
Borja, which is thirty miles by trail
south of Cusl.

REPORTS SHOW
PIMM. AFFAIR
CARRANZA SOLDIERS PURSUE
AMERICANS AND AID MOB IN
FIRING ON THEM.
Mexico City, April 17.—The
war office received a dispatch last
night in which further details are
given of the Parral affair. It was
asserted an American army of
ficer admitted his culpability for
entering the town.
The dispatch also says Ameri
can troops have ceased their'
movements southward until such
time as the negotiations between
the United States and Mexioan
governments are terminated.
Washington, D. C., April 17.—State
and war department officials refused
to comment today on Gen. Pershing's
report of the Parral fight, which is
much different from the version trans
mitted by Gen. Carranza to support his
suggestion that American troops be
withdrawn. The American report
shows that Carranza troops not only
joined in the attack upon the little
detachment of Americans but'followed
them several miles as they withdrew
to avoid a clash.
The reply to the proposal of Gen.
Carranza for withdrawal of the Ameri
can forces was still in preparation to
day. It will outline the terms under
which the United States will discuss
the withdrawal of its forces and until
report of Villa's death has been con
firmed no change in the program will
be made.
STORY OF REFUGEES.
San Antonio, Tex., April 17.—It was
a force of Carranza's soldiers who en
gaged the little detachment of Ameri
can cavalry at Parral Wednesday in a
regularly organized action, according
to a detailed report written by Maj.
Frank Tompkins and forwarded to
Gen. Funston by Gen. Pershing.
Forty of the Mexicans, including one
major and one civilian, were killed by
the retreating Americans. The Amer
ican casualties were two killed and
six wounded, including Maj. Tompkins.
His wound was slight.
Three Americans reaching the
United States from a mine near Par
ral gave another version of the fight.
They said the Americans, numbering
more than 100, entered the town from
the station, riding into the Plaza San
Juan de Adios, where they dismounted,
unsaddled their horses, and sat down
in the Plaza to rest after the long ride.
This was on Wednesday shortly be
fore noon. The school children were
being dismissed for the noon hour on
the opposite side of the plaza, as the
Americans unsaddled their' horses.
The troops entered the town, they
said, to buy provisions. In the mean
time a nob was forming on La Prieta
hill, the Americans declared, and were
waving flags and displaying firearms,
many of the mob being composed of
women and children.
Requested to Withdraw.
Fearing trouble the civil authorities
of Parral went to the troops and re
quested that they withdraw. The
American troopers then saddled, buck
led on their side arms, mounted, and
rode out of town. The troops were
followed by the mob, which continued
behind the troops until the railroad
Btation was reached, when some one
in the mob fired, and one American
soldier dropped from his saddle. Furth
er on another soldier was shot and
killed by some member of the mob.
Then the Americans returned the
fire. Carranza soldiers from thek gar
rison were called out by the military
officers and started after the American
soldiers to scatter the mob. The firing
on the populace by the American
troops occurred outside of the town,
according to the Americans, and a
large number of the Mexican mob
were killed, the exact number not be
ing known.
SOLDIERS GET DRUNK.
Columbus. N. M., April 17.—Distur
bances at Las Palomas, eight miles
south of the border, followed pay day
for the Carranza soldiers patrolling
the international line, according to re
ports here today. The forty men*
were paid yesterday for the first time
in two months, it is asserted, each
man receiving five American dollars
and twenty-six dollars in Carranza
currency. Investigation showed that
the disturbances were minor and
caused mainly by Intoxication.
Three motor troops of twenty-seven
trucks each started today for the
front carrying rations, clothing and
other supplies, a record number to
depart from the expeditionary base.
Infantry drill, which was discon
tinued temporarily with the depart
ure of the expeditionary force, was
resumed today by troops on station
here.

WILSON FINISHES
HIS LATEST NOTE
Spends Sunday Drawing Up
"Final Word" Regarding
Ocean Controversy
Washington, D. C., April 17. —An
nouncement was made at the white
bouse today that President Wilson had
practically completed consideration of
the forthcoming communication to
Germany and It was indicated that it
probably will go forward to Berlin late
today or tomorrow.
President Wilson, It was said, has
been steadily engaged on the note for
two days. He did not go to church yes
terday but worked practically all day
examining evidence submitted by the
state department.
The document, officials said, will
press the submarine issue to a deci
sion. It was reiterated that the Sus
sex case would form only a link in
the chain of evidence the United
States will present to Germany to
show that her promises have not been
fulfilled.
Break Is In 8ight.
The document was characterized by
officials today as being very positive
in tone and they believe that only a
prompt acquiescence by Germany in
the position taken by the United
States can prevent a break in diplo
matic relations.
Unofficial dispatches from Berlin in
dicating that the German government
1b ready to meet the United States
more than half way, it was said will
not change the course of the American
government decided on at Friday's
cabinet meeting.
The, president and hia cabinet have
agreed on the steps to be taken and
the president Is now finishing the
phraseology of the proposed communi
cation. He intends to include in the
Indictment of Germany's submarine
campaign attacks on neutral vessels
not carrying Americans. That will be
done on the broad grounds of humanity
and for the reason that many of these
neutral vessels were going to or from
the United States.
State department officials declared
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin had not
yet submitted a report of conversa
tions he was reported In press dis
patches last week to have had with of
ficials of the foreign, office.
AMERICAN INJURED.
Washington, D. C., April 17.—One of
two Americans aboard the Russian
bark Imperator, from Gulfport, Miss.,
for Marseilles, France, was wounded
when the vessel was fired upon with
out warning by an Austrian subma
rine off the Culumbrede islands, ac
cording to official advices to the state
department today.
The American injured was Gustav
Olson, whose father is bandmaster at
Ft. Warren, Boston. The other Ameri
can who was aboard was Abner
Sweennsson, whose brother is .fore
man of a Minneapolis furniture fac
tory.
The state department's information
came from the American consul at
Barcelona, Spain. He said the ship
was fired upon without warning on
April 11.' Three shots were fired, one
taking efTect. The vessel was set
afire by the submarine. Olson was
reported to be in a hospital at Bar
celona, suffering from shrapnel
wounds.
RIOTING IN GREECE.
London, April 17.—Reuter's Athens
correspondent says that several shots
were fired in the riot which resulted
from the campaign meeting of the
Venizelos party yesterday and that
many followers of the former premier
were arrested.

For Extradition to Canada of

Washington, D. C., April 17.—Thos.
Kelly, a contractor, wanted in Winni
peg in connection, with alleged frauds
in construction of the parliament
buildings there, today lost his fight
against extradition in the supreme
court. The high court affirmed the
federal court in Chicago which refus
ed to release Kelly on habeas corpus.
Canada asked for Kelly's extradition
that hte might be tried on a charge
of obtaining $1,250,000 by false pre
tenses on the parliament buildings
contract. His case was argued only a
few days ago and the court at special
request gave speedy consideration.
Apparently no legal process now is
available to prevent his extradition to

HELD IN CHECK.
London, April 17.—After temporarily
assuming the aggressive in the Verdun
battle, launching attacks in the Dou
aumont-Vaux region which are declar
ed to have gained them some ground,
the French yesterday and last night
held their infantry in check. Neither
was there any move by the German
infantry arm, according to this after
noon's Paris bulletin.
Apparently a new movement of
some importance is preparing west of
the Meuse. Heavy bombardment of
the French positions in the Avocourt
region and along the line for some dis
tance northeast, including the Dead
Man's hill sector, has been mentioned
in several recent official statements by
the French office and similar artillery
activity is* again recorded today.
Britons Defeat Turks.
The British have pushed steadily
ahead, have driven in the Turks from
their advanced lines, on the right bank
of the Tigris river, and occupied their
lines, killing many of the TurkB and
taking a considerable number of pris

The Russians also have driven the
Turks from a strongly organized posi

and are pursuing them.
On the northern Russian line artil
lery duels are going on between the
Russians and Germans and farther
south, near Smorgon, the Germans
started an offensive but were repulsed.
South of the Olyka station the Rus

DEATH SENTENCE
ON YOUTH STAYED
ILLINOIS GOVERNOR PLAYS PART
IN SAVING LIFE OF BOY CON
DEMNED TO DIE.
Springfield, 111., April 17.—Gov.
Dunne, opponent of capital punish
ment and whose reprieving power is
all that is keeping alive three colored
men under sentence of death in Illi
nois, had much to do with the commu
tation of the Arkansas death sen
tence of Clarence Dewein of Belle
ville, 111., it was declared here today
by Fred Kern, president of the state
board of administration.
Dewein, 22 years old, with Joe
Strong of Seligman, Ariz., was con
victed in November, 1915, of the mur
der of L. H. Thompson, an aged mer
chant at Benton, Ark. The men were
to have been electrocuted tomorrow.
Dewein's parents had made all ar
rangements for his funeral when word
came that Gov. G. W. Hays of Arkan
sas had decided to commute their sen
tences to life imprisonment.
Mr. Kern, who lives* in Belleville,
111., and is a friend of young Dewein's
father, told today how he had taken
the boys' case up with Gov. Dunne.
"I told him it was his first offense,
pointed out his extreme youth and
vouched for his good raising," said
Mr. Kern. "Then the governor wrote
to the governor of Arkansas. I am
satisfied his letter had much to do
with the commutation of young De
wein's sentence."
Elston Scott, at Murphysboro,
"Chicken Joe' Campbell, at Joliet, and
"Big John" Murphy at Danville are
the three convicted murderers whose
extended leases on life are duQ to re

expected that any of these men will
be pardoned, however.

New York, April 17. —American

says Dr. George Sidney Webster, sec
retary of the American Seamen's
Friends' society. This has been ac
complished, he says, by offering higher
wages than the sailor has been accus
tomed to receiving and he has reason
to believe that the shipping and man
ufacturing men have been bidding
against each other for the sailor's ser
vice.

Fourteen witnesses were used during
the morning session and a great:

Thought Character Bad.
George Maring, who lives three
miles east of Eldon. was the first Wit
ness called to testify as to Doran's
general character as to morality. He
said that he was not acquainted, only
as his sons and others had told hltn,*
and that Doran's reputation was bad. 1
He said that the people In whom he.
had confidence all told him that.

tell things which lead him to believe 4
that his (Doran's) character was bad.
Will Lynch, living east of BAdiMM
said that he had known Doran lor?,
seven or eight years and he would
say that his character was bad. He
told the court that he married Doran's
sister six years ago.
On cross examination the witness 1
said that he and bis wife lived to-!

she sued and obtained a divorce from I
him. He said that he and Doran had
