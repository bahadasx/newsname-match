\ You may wander, you may roam the {
wide wond o'er, but finally you will j
turn your steps and your eyes with j
longing to old Xewberry if you are j
to the manner born. And if the op- j
MIW
M
portunity offers you wni come back j
with. us. An J we are always pleased I
to welcome the retur . of the wander- |

clasp and cordial and fatherly greet- j
ing.
The schools of Newberry have ben j
fortunate in securing the services of I
so well equipped and scholarly man !
as Dr. Jas. P. Kinard for their head, j
His life has bee: devoted to the j
^ anse of education and it was in the '
lon-g ago before we had a graded |
scliool system in Newberry that he |
i tanr-T.t t:hp schools of this town. And |
he is still a young man. Even a man j
so young as the editor of The Herald j
ami News can remember when the:
present school system was inaugur- i
ated. If you could get a file of the j
old Newberry News. R. H. Greneker, \
I * -proprietor, and E. H. Aull. editor, you
I would fi>r-d that we made the fight for
the establishment of the present
school system, and we won. And that
v.'as after Dr. Kinard taught the vil- j
lag? school in Newberry. The town j
srd the schools have grown since th? ;
"crVift-.. Tim Kinard tausrht the !

rr. Kinard is a native of New-f
bcry ?nd a soil of the late Capt. Jno. j
>1. :. ard who was killed at the bar- '
t!e of Strausburg while leading his;
regiment. Dr. Kinard was born in j
I $64 and never had the pleasure of j
lowing his father. He was reared j
by a good Ch.^tiaa mother. He is J
*. brother of Joh.r M. Kinard of Newberry
and a half of Air. J. Y. McFall
of Newberry.
