embassy; The only dispatch frorr
c olor to the report was the brief st
eleventh cavalry, now near Parra!,
him to believe that Villa and a few
iiarja is near the place where une
hody/ was found.
Kiiroute to Chihuahua.
While- Villa's body is said to be en
route to Chihuahua City, Washing?on
has not ordered General Funston or
General Pershing to 'take any steps
to make certain its Identification.
This fact is considered significant of
the attitude of the state department
towards the report of Villa's death.
However, it ls intimated that the Unit
ed States might be willing to accept
a formal declaration from Carranza
that Villa has been killed and order
the recall of troops. The state de
partment has not answered the Car
ranza note requesting the withdraw-,
al of troops and is awaiting complete
data on the Par?-al incident.
* A recapitulation pf the expedition
Into Mexico shows Villa handily kill
ed as seventy, wounded unknown,
prisoners, "six; American soldiers
killed three, wounded thirteen, mis
sing one., in addition forty civilians
or Carranza soldiers are reported
killed at Parral.
GEORGIA-CAROLINA LINE
DISPUTE MEANS A TIDY
SUM IN WAY OF TAXES |
Atlanta, April 17.-Where dois the
state line rest between Georgia and
South Carolina? Is the line In the
vrjiuchannel of the Tugaloo river or
*?ong the South Carolina bank of the
Tiver? On tho answer to these ques
tions hinges the collections or the non
collection by the state of Georgia of
several thousand dollars in taxes from
the Georgia Railway & Power com
pany oh Its dam at Gregg Shoals.
The state of Georgia contends that
the line .between Georgia and South
Carolina lies along the South Caro
lina shore of the Tugaloo river, and
therefore the whole dara .is within , the
state of Georgia and subject.to taxa
tion by this state.
The power company, oa the other
hand, claims that the state line lies
in midchannei, and iherefore only
? half, or approximately half, of the
dam IB subject to taxation by. "thc
state of Georgia.
The decision of a board of arbitra
tion appointed sove-.Ul months ago
was unsatisfactory to tho litigants
and the caso today went beforo the
state supremo court ot Georgia on
nppoal. lt is likely that tho United
States E-tinremo court, will finally de
termine the location of the state lino.

1.81 IS FIGHTING
ACT OF LEGISLATURE
Effort Made to Over-Ride Law

3>5V'T?r03pectlvo candidate for- gov
ernor, gs the ranking member; up*
pettred today before the stnto su
preme court of Georgia as attorneys
for the Louisville & Nashville rail
road in tho latter's attempt to ovcr
rido the act of the Georgia legisla
tura prohibiting the issuance of a
charter to any railroad to build a
Uno parallel to thc Western ft At
lantic railroad, which ls owned by
the ?tate and leased to the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St Louis ra>lifjnd,
which railroad In turn is controlled
by tho Louisville & Nashville.
Tho Louisville & Nashville applied
to Secretary of Stato Phil Cook for-a
charter for the North Georgia Min
eral railroad, a Uno which tho Louis
viii'.? ft Nashville proposes to build
from a point near Carterville Into
Atlanta, thereby completing tho last
lino of Its Intended nnd attempted
parallel of the Western ft Atlantic.
Secretary of State Cook, In compli
ance wfi-h the anti-parallel act which
the legislature, passed in lft 15, declin
ed to grant, the charter. The Louis
ville & Nashville the-.?, brought man
damus proceedings in Fulton superior
court to compel Secretury Cook to
grant the charter. Judge Pendleton
declined to iBsue the writ. Tho Louis
ville & Nashville then appoaled from
Judge Pendleton to the supreme court,
and the case came on for argument
before the supreme court today.
On the outcome of this legal f'ght,
In which the state will be fought not
only by Dorsey, Brewster, llowoll ft
Heymau, but also by the law firm of
King & Spalding of Atlanta, depends
in a largo measure the futuro value
of the Western & Atlantic railroad,
which yields a 'rental almost sufll
clent to maintain tho common school",
of the state,' and furnishes the basic
for the-state's credit.
In all probability the case will be
fought through to the United States
.supremo court, as the LouTiviiie ft
Nashville railroad OT to bring about
Its fee le by tho state.
: The state will bo represented by
Attorney General Clifford M. Walker.
