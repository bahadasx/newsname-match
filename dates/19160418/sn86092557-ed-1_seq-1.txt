A smail party of American officers |

P lief that the expeditionary commauirI
is confronted with a serious problem.!
It At cGueriil Pershing's headquarters j
there seemed no prospect of a re-,
jjgi simiption of the chase. There were I
numeroiiK indications that a cotitinua-1
tion of the pursuit would meet with!
armed resistance. A report received J

If Franrlico Villa is not dead he lias
'now au excellent chance to escape into !

; of the American detachments because
the punitive force has penetrated ;
. about as far south a:; it is going to I

Official admissions that it was im*!

; .communication south of Satovo. was!
i'^taken today to mean that the Held of 1
r. ^operations would restricted to that
^/.district over which detachments of,
? cavalry with provisions for one or two
^,'days could ride. Beyond the arc of,
that fan, Villa would be safe so far,
a. as the Americans are concerned.
Officers here regard the Parrell in- j
vV-eident as indicating clearly that Gen
"eral Pershing's men now have to guard
themselves not. only against attack. by
Villa's men but by those detachments
of the Carranza army that are antag
onistic to his announced attitude of
cooperation.
' v Genoral Funston today asked that
. a report be made to him at once 011
; ?tlie unofficial rumor that a train load

Housecleaning Time
at the Court House
The pungent aromatic odor of ere
sol and other disinfectants fills the
court house today and the place smells*
moro like a morgue than usual. Spring
housecleaning at the local institution
has begun and in addition to tho win
dows being washed the janitors have
rubbed all the floors with some evil
smelling dope that is supposed pre
serve and beautify tho finish of the
wood.
Tho county officials that have to re
main in the building a portion of their
time say that the smell will soon leavo
but even so they are glad that spring
comes but once a year.
The strong breeze that has blown all
day is doing much to drive away the
unple:isant odor and it. is thought that
by Thursday or Friday the place will
be habitable.
PITTSBURGHER HIT AT PARRAL

Great Change in Public At
titude Since Last
Year.
Clean Up Work Progressing
Rapidly in All Sections
of the City.
Tlio first day of the third annual
Clean-Up Week In FaiVmont resulted
in the entire section from the railroad
to Fairmont avenue on the South Side
being covered on horseback by the
Bayor and sanitary officer.
The Mayor reports that upon no oc- j
casion did he moet with any trouble,
and states that the people are with
him and quite willing to assist in mak
ing Fairmont the cleanest city in the
state.
In the section mentioned there arai
many day laborers, foreigners, etc.,
living near the railroad back of the
factories. Even this part of the city;
showed great enthusiasm in helping i
tne Mayor in the light against disease
and dirt.
The change in the attitude of the
people, according to the Mayor, is re-1
markahle. Last year and the year pre
vious ho had more or less difficulty;
in convincing the residents of the city j
that Clean-Up Week was a thing of ne
cessity. and also had trouble with |
many property owners who felt it aj
constitutional right to refuse to re
move debris from their property. But;
this petty animosity had passed over, j
he says, and every place the Mayor I
visited he found the people in accord j
with the movement.
The south end. of, the South Side |
will be looked^-after today-^ut^fiu scout j
trip over that section a* few days!
ago proved conclusively to the Mayor!
that there would be no extra efforts 1
required to make the residents real- j
tee the good which the movement will
do. j
The Civic committee of the Wo- j
man's club, which consists of Mrs. I
B. L. Butcher. Mrs. F. E. Nichols and |
Mrs. Charles Powell is working as
diligently as the Mayor and has been
on the lookout for conditions which |
may require the attention of the san
itary officer. The town is simply cover- j
ed with observers and as soon as one j
of these undesirable conditions is;
found, the telephone is resorted to and
the whole thing laid before the po-,
lice, who in turn look into the mat-1
tor.
The city street (lusher will be put
to work flushing the streets and keep
lug down dust, and dirt as much as
possible. It will be used in the busi
ness district every day during the
summer and the other sections about
every other day.
Army Fliers to Be
Given a Shake Up
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAMUEL
REBER HAS BEEN RELIEVED
OF HIS COMMAND
WASHINGTON. April IS.?Lieuten
ant Colonel Samuel Heber. head of
the aviation section of the signal
corps of the army, yesterday was re
lieved of his command by order of
Secretary of Wnr Baker, as a result
or the general Investigation into the
aviation corps.
The findings of the hoard appoint
ed to conduct the investigation as
made public by Secretary Baker, said
that part of the criticism of the avia
tion corps was unjustified, but found
that there was reason to believe there
is some inefficiency. Further inves
tigation by the army general staff was
recommended as to the manner in
which the aviation school at San Diego
was being managed and to learn about
the discipline there.
Brigadier General J. P. Schriven,
chief signal officer of the army, wa*
also censured for "his failure personal
ly to supervise the disciplinary fea
tures" of the aviation corps adminis
tration.

1ETI0NH
TO BE EXTENDED
El
Town Has Adopted Bond Is
sue for Paving Its
Streets.
VOTEUERlElli
Officials Want Tracks Ex
tended Before the New j
Roads are Built.
Twenty thousand dollars will be ex
pended ror paving in the town of Lutu
berport in Harrison county. A bond
issue for this sum was voted yester
day by the citizens of the town and ?
the bonds carried by the large major-1
ity of 129 for, and 9 against. About
one and a half miles of paving will
bo constructed in the center of the!
town, part of which will be brick and 1
part concrete.
The town offtcials have asked the i
Monongahela Valley Traction company '
to extend tlieir present car line so!
that it will reach the center of the!
town. This would require less than I
half a mile of additional track con-j
struction as the line now extends from !
the Clarksburg and Fairmont inter-'
urban tracks to within n short dis-1
tance ot' the Short line station at j^um-:
berport. A conference of the town of- j
iicials was held yesterday with Smith;
Hood, E. B. Moore and other officials'
of the traction company who visited
Lumberport. at which the proposed ex-,
tension of the lines was discussed. i
A preliminary survey of the poasi-1
ble locations of the proposed cxtens-1
ion will be made by the traction com-!
pany engineers, and the new traclcrf,
will be built at the time of laying the s
new pavement if the present plans are
carried out. The city officials of Lum-j
berport expect to have the new pave-1
mcnt completed by early in the sum- j
mor.
The construction of the proposed
extension of the connecting traction
spur which now carries paaoagers i
from Haywood station to the Short
line station will greatly facilitate trav- i
ol from Fairmont to points on the Short i
lino. At present it is necessary to j
walk nearly half n mile from the end i
of the traction spur to the railroad
station and in bad weather this is J
sometimes very inconvenient to trnv- J
elers.

I
County Engineer Wilfong ?
Will Go After the Worst
Places First.
Work of Ailing up the worst mud- j
holes 011 the dirt roads o( the couuty j
was begun today and is well under j
way with nearly 50 men employed at |
various places in the county. Sixteen j
prisoners from the county jail were
working yesterday and today on the!
bad place on tlie Colfax road near,
Kingmont. The prisoners are working i
under the supervision of Officers Bain- j
bridge and Harris, and seem glad to .
be allowed to get out of the jail each I
day for a breath ot air and a bit of
sunshine.
The prisoners are taken out each
morning to the place where they are
most needed and at evening return
to jail.
One of the men. Andrew Kralchik,
was injured by the falling of a large
stone which struck him on the ankle j
as he was at work. He was brought
back to Fairmont and his injury dress- j
ed by County Physician L. X. Yost.
It is thought that. Andrew will be
able to go back to work again in a
few days.
County Engineer Wilfong hopes to
fix as many of the worst places in
the county as is possible by draining
the .water from the. nxudhcles^ud llllvi
ing them with dirt 'and stone. The-rhr?-r
er roud to Kingmont is in extremely
bad condition at this time and about !
20 men with teams and road scrapers j
are at work trying to gt it in shape j
before the heavy trafTic of summer be- I
gins. Work is also being done on the j
RIvesville road and the Fairvicw road j
in Paw Paw district.
All of the dirt roads in the county i
are at present still muddy and rough j
so that nothing but horses and light,
wagons can pass over them, but if
the road machines can be used soon
enough before the mud has thoroughly
dried, the roads will be passable until
the next heavy railfall.
It is estimated by the good roads
workers that enough money has been
spent in repairing and patching up
dirt roads in the past 20 years to pave
al the main thoroughfares in the
county, with a wide concrete or hard
surfaced mecadam pavement.
