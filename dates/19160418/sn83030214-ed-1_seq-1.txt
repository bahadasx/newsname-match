Pens "Last Word" to Berlin.
Washington, April 17.?The communicatlon which he haa
drafted aa tho last word of the United State? to Germany on the
submarinr- isasue was completed lo-day by President Wilson.
It probably will be dispatched to Berlin to-morrow.
The document reviews Germany's submarine activities
since the Lusitania was eunk, almost a year ago. and makes
plain that only an immediate change in the German poiicy can
make possible the continuance of friendly relations between
the two nations.
Ai the President was putting the finiahing touchea to the
nt)te, on which he and Secretary Lansing had been working for
nearly a week, offlcial word was received by the State Depart
ment that thi* Uvea of two Americans had been r-ndangered by
U attaek on the Russian bark Imperator by .in Austrian sub
marino. (ari Bailey Hurst, American Conaiil G< neral at Barce
laoa, Spain. who sent the report, said the attaek was without*
warning. Dne of the American citizenf* on board was wounded
el shellfl fired by the pubmarine.
