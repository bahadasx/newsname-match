account for the delay in obtaining con

No Steps For Identification.
If General Funston and General
Pershing have taken any steps to make
certain the identification of the body
they have done so on heir own initi
ative. No instructions to that end
have been sent from Washington
either to consuls or military com
manders. This fact may be significant of the
attitute of the state department. It
was intimated today that the United
States government might be wiling
to accept a formal declaration from
General Carranza that Villa had been
killed and order the recall of the
troops.
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, after
a brief conference today with Secre
tary Baker, expressed the view that
the Carranza authorities hardly could
have any object in circulating a report
of 'Villa's death unless they believed
It to be true. He agreed with Sec

ever, in accepting th reports of the

caution.

last word of the United States to Ger
many in the submarine issue was com
pleted today bv President Wilson. It
probably will be dispatched to Berlin
tomorrow.
The communication reviews Ger
many's submarine activities since the
Lusitania was sunk almost a year ago
and makes it plain that only by an
Immediate change in he German poli
cy can friendly relations continue be
tween the two nations.
As the president was putting the fin
ishing touches to the note on which he
and Secretary Lansing had geen work
ing for nearly a week, official wora
was received by the state department
that the lives of two Americans had
been endangered by an attack on the
Russian bark Imperator by an Aus
trian submarine. Carl Bailey Hurst
American consul-general at Barcelona,
Spain, who sent the report, said the
attack was without warning. One of
the American citizens was wounded by
shrarnel shells tired by the submarine.
A full investigation of the Incident
was ordered at once by th4 state de
partment. If the consul-general's re
port is borne out, representations sim
liar to those about to be made to Ger
many probably will be sent to Aus

ed last year by a lower court whereby
custody of the couple's daughter, Ol-
ga. was granted t othe mother.
The attorney for Sirs. Ellis renewed
the contentions which were made at
the trial, telling how the troubles of
the couple began an 1912, when the
wife brought divorce proceedings in a
Massachusetts court and secured the
custody of her child, and how in the
following year Ellis kidnapped his
daughter and escaped to Japan, where
he secured a position as a school
teacher. The attorney presented the
Jecree of the Macsachusett s court.
Counsel for Mr. Ellis argues that
Mrs. Ellis was suffering from mental
aberration and that she was unsuited
to take charge of her daughter. The
court was asked to consider carefully
whether the mother would make the
more acceptable guardian, and to con
sult the wishes of the child itself.
Further evidence will be taken on both
sides at subsequent hearings.

Washington, April 17. Confirmation
of the death of Francisco Villa still
was lacking tonight both at the state
and war departments and at the Mex

American sources in Mexico tending
to lend color to the report, was a brief
statement from Major Howsee of the
Eleventh Cavalry, now near Parral,
that he had Information which led him
to believe that the bandit and a small
party of his followers had fled some
days ago toward Barja, which Is close
to the place where unofficial Mexican
reports say the body was found.
The outstanding feature or the day s

for
Munich, Germany, April 1". One of
the most easily effected economies in
the postal service, not only of Ger
many, but of any country, would be the
abolition of the postage stamp, the
Neuste Nachrichten points out. It
recommends the substitution of a
franking machine for the postage
stamp and remarks that this change
would save Germany nearly $25,000,000
a year.
The franking machine by a single
operation would not only imprint the
letter with a device indicating that the
postal charges had been prepaid but
would also put on the postmark and
obviate the necessity of using the
cancelling- machine. . This method is
already used in Bavaria and in New
Zealand, while the German field post
has taught the people of Germany that
the change is entirely practicable. "The
postage stamp," concludes the Nach
richten, 'though a great invention, is
now obsolete. Germany has invented
the franking system, and by develop
ing it she will be doing civilization a
great service."

result of the phenomenal grain prices
ruling in Scotland is that the salaries
of the parish ministers of the Estab

due to the fact tha,t the amount of
these salaries is governed by the prices

On the other hand, the professors of
