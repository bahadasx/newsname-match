MAPES DISCOVERS "PLOT
Questions Person Calling and
Reoeiver Is Abruptly
Hung Up.
An anonymous and mysterious tele
phone call to varloui members of tho
House District Commlttoe Informing
them that there would be no mooting
today, almost prevented tho meeting or
that committee.
Chairmen Ben Johnson and other
memberi have not yet ascertained who
sent out the misleading telephone calls,
but there U a suspicion that It waa
dene for a deflnlto purpose, and goes
beyond the practical Joke.
CoBgtessman Mapes of Michigan,
when told that tho committee would not
meet, failed to rccognlzo tho volco of
the Informant, and becamo auspicious.
A noon aa Mr. Stapes asked "Who aro
you"" the man at tho other end of the
telephone wire abruptly nun up the
reoeiver.
Chairman Johnson sat In tho commit
tee room for nearly an hour this morn
Ins; and was taken aback 'when almost
a dosen membors dropped in caeually
to ask why tho meeting had been post
poned. Mr. Johnson was quite angr
over the performance, and has started
an Investigation to ascertain, 1C pos
sible, who sent out the f.ilso telephone
messages.
When Chairman Johnson learnp'l'thnt
ome ono was tampering with tho com
mittee meeting dmerm:t tnnmonrs of
the committee were called over tho
telephone and a sufficient number fin
ally arrived to do buslnosa.
Home members of tho commtttco are
Inclined to think that a person inter
ested In one or moro bills pending to
Tore the committee sought to prevent
the committee meeting tor fear these
bills would be considered. It Is not
known At this time what bill caused tho
fake telephone messages.
The District committee decided today
to authorlso Chairman Johnson to. pre
pare a. unanimous, consent calendar for
the committee upon which shall bo
r laced all bills now, before tho commlt
r to which there Is 'no objection.
These uncontested bills will be con
sidered and reported at an early special
meeting. The District Commltteto In
tends to make no report for the present
on contested mattera. nn thu llntian
legislative program precludes consider
ation or any great quantity of District
legislation at this session.
District Must Pay
For Moving Mains
Comptroller Holds Water Depart
ment Must Provide for
Change on Avenue Bridge.
Comptroller of the Treasury Warwick
today ruled that the District Water De
partment must bear tho expense of low
ering the water mains 'on the new Penn
sylvania avenue bridge because of the
transfer of the Capital Traction Com
pany's tracks to the structure.
He also held that the railway company
must pave the space betwen Its tracks
and two feet addlUonal on either side,
from Twenty-sixth and Pennsylvania
avenue to Twenty-ninth street.
The case was submitted to the Comp
troller by the District Commissioners
because the transfer of the company's
tracks from the M street bridge to the
new structure will place the electric
conduits dangerously near the water
mains across the new bridge. The com
missioners believed the company should
bear the expense of moving the mains
further from the electric conduits. The
Comptroller, however, ruled that the
company did not wish to move Its con
duits, but was required by act of Con
gress to do so, and that any expense at
tending the removal of the water mains
must be borne by tho Water Department.
The Comptroller holds that when the
Capital Traction Company pays one
third of the cost of constructing the
bridge It will have discharged all Its
financial obligations In tho matter ex
cept to repave between the tracks.

wero partially thrown back from a first
line trench they penetrated In Chaur

The bombardment of mil 301 Is in

The Germans attacked with tho great
est lolcnco on a ragged rront, extend
ing from the Meuse In o. southeasterly
direction .to the Douaumont-Urnes

The first blow fell against the Kronen
barriers In the narrow ravine southeast

DECLARES PLEDGES BROKEN
Indictment Sums Up Submarine
Case and Alleges Array ef
Proofs.
America's last word to Germany on
the submarine Issue probably will leave
for Berlin tonight. A Ungthy not.e re
markable for lta dispassionate language
but unmistakable aa to Its purpose, has
been completed by the President him
self. The message was laid before the
Cabinet meeting today. .This afternoon
ii proDaoiy win oe shown to Chairman
William J. atone, of tho Senate Commit
tee on Korelgn Relations, and, perhaps,
to Chairman Henry D. Flood, of the
House Committee, it may be sent to the
cablo cfflce before nightfall.
The communication Is said to leave
but one doorway open to Oermtny, If
sho would avoid a diplomatic break
with tho United States. She roust aban
don her submarlno warfare against
mcrcnaut snips.
With palntaklng care the note sums
up tho Indictment against Germany.
i lleglnnlng with the still unsettled case
of the Curiard liner Lusltanla, case after
i case Is cited, the total being regarded
by this Government as comprising an
overwhelming array of proofs that Ger
l many has violated -the rules of human-
; lty nud broken her pledges.
Recalls Berlin Promises.
It tells of the cases which Immedlatu-
ly followed the I.uslUnla, and the prom
Iocs glvn by Oionuny at the lime of
tho sinking of tlis A.-iule. It remind
i Germany that tho HattuJ Htalts. vlil-.
ing to subordinate her past grievances
to tho Interest of humanity, was 'ie
pared ta accept these promise, when
Germany Issued her n;w .1 ecus', stating
that on and after March J sbn would
begin attacking all Aimed enemy mer
chantmen without warning. - t- x.
Almost Immediately, thq.nate. g.r on.
to say; thero began' a" succession ot
cases .of submarine attacks, the most
noteworthy feature ot which waa the
fact that, whereas the March 1 decrte
was limited to armed enemy liners,
most of the attacks were against un
armed ships, many of them being ot
neutral nationality.
The noto draws the Inference thut
either Germany has rccalii'd tier past
pledges, or that her submarine have
bun unablo to distinguish the charac
ter .ind nationality of the ships that
havo I een made the targe..
Preferring to believe the latter view is
the correct one, the note Insists that
circumstances have demonstrated the
utter Impossibility of pursuing the sub
marine timpalgn without transgress
ing tho rights or neutrals, and lor that
reason the United States feels cilled
upon, solemnly and with due regard tor
the good relations between the two
countries that cannot otherwise con
tine, to Insist that Germany abandon
the submarine warfare.
At Parting of Waya.
Officials of the Administration thor
oughly appreciate the fact that the re
lations between the two countries are
at the parting or the ways; that within
two weeks Germany, by her reply, may
force the United States to sever these
relations.
At the same time the President lb said
to be determined to settle- the matter
once and for all, and has so drawn the
note that Germany cannot fall to real
lie this.
The Cabinet waa In session longer
than It has been for some time. Al
though the manner of the members as
they left the White HoUso reflected the
gravity of the situation, they declined
to make any comments.

NEW TOIIK. April 18. Wolf von Igle,

called German military attach, was ar

Attempted a get-away.
Von Igle was Indicted yesterday with
von Papen, Capt Hans Tauscher, hus

Agents of tho Justice Department call

they found the former attache's secre

RENEW HUNT FOR
MLLA; DEATH ONLY
HOAX, SAYS BELL
Army Officer Declares
ricated the Story of Bandit's Death-
Orders Go Out From San Antonio for
New Troop Activity.
DEFENSIVE PLANS
Lines of Communication Are Given Greater
Protection Troops Are ' " Digging
Themselves In" to Prevent Further
Hostile Acts By Carranza Forces.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 18. On receipt of a
dispatch from General Bell, at El Paso, declaring that the
report of Villa's death had evidently been manufactured in
Juarez, army officers directed a renewal of the search for
the bandit leader today.
General Bell officially reported to Major General Fun
ston declaring his belief that the entire story of Villa's body
having been found was a fabrication and originated at
Juarez. .
A statement from Consul Letcher at Chihuahua fur
ther discredited the story, asserting that dispatches from
Cusihuiraichic made no mention of the body.
Early advices to headquarters told of a g.ilheriug of
scattered American detachments near Satevo? r
"-Indications point to resumption of the bandit hunt
on a scale limited to conform to the present line of com
munications. This is believed to mean that Funston in
tends to make the best of the facilities at hand, meantime
hoping for permission to use the Mexican railways or
sanction for a new line with the American base near Pre
sidio, Tex.
TAKES STEPS TO DEFEND SUPPLY LINE.
EL PASO, April 18. The Villa hunt is a secondary
matter to the guarding of American lines of communica
tion, according to army officers here.
Concentration of troops to prevent renewal of such
attacks as that at Parral is being undertaken.
Brigadier General Pershing, it is understood, has re
ported to Major General Funston that his troops are "dig
ging themselves in" and are prepared to meet any move of
Carranzista troops or bandit bands. He has established
himself at Namiquipa, where he can be in touch with all
parts of the line and better meet any hostile move.
American officials here are ready to accept General
Carlos Carranza's identification of the body said to be that
of the bandit chief and advise the withdrawal of troops as
having accomplished the object of the expedition.
Certification of Villa's death by officials of the de
facto government is all that can be expected, say officials
here, although it is expected that no obstacle will be placed
by Carranzista officials in the way of further confirmation
by the American authorities.
The question whether the body, presumably being
taken into Chihuahua City, is that of Villa is still holding
attention, but the safety of the American expedition, fol
lowing the Parral incident and the withdrawal request
from General Carranza is uppermost in the minds of army
chiefs along the border.
PERSHING LEAVES SATEVO.
Pershing has left his advanced base at Satevo and re
turned to his Namiquipa staff headquarters. At Nami
quipa, about midway along the lines of communication, he
can keep a closer witch on the situation and better direct
his army. No American troops are now believed to be
south of Santa Cruz.
If Villa is not dead, but has escaped into Durango, as
formerly reported, the American pursuit has apparently
been halted. If the body reported exhumed west of Satevo
is not Villa's, neither the United States nor the Mexican
authorities have any adequate idea of the bandit chief's
whereabouts, they admit.
Mexican officials, professing to have direct knowl
edge of the finding of Villa's tody near San Francisco
Porja, claim that cutting of wires last night prevented re
ceipt of further information today.
While the failure of the Mexicans to produce the body
