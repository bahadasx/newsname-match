TALK OVERTROUBLES
Columbia Is Raked Fore and
Aft at Meeting of Local
Organization.
M.U. IS JABBED, TOO
Civic Ills, From Profanitv to
Truancy, Come In for
Share of Argument.
M.ior J M. liatterton appeared be
fore the a T U. at the Y M. C. A.
Iluilding jesterduy and was ques
tioned for an hour about the enforce
ment of Columbia's ordinances against
intoxicants, cigarettes, swearing, spit
ting on the sidewalks and truancy.
The ma or acknowledged that the
administration of these laws had
been lax during the last jcar, hut
lie hoped the coming shake-up in the
police department would improve con
ditions. Ma or liatterton was asked by the
president, Mrs. John T. Esrey, to ex
plain the restraining order recently
granted by Judge Harris against the
shipment of liquor into Columbia. He
.said: 'The restraining order is onl
an experiment, hut we think we will
win. We did not think we could win
in the cigarette case if an injunction
was issued against us. We feel that
we can win this case We are going
to win if possible. Hut it has to be
tested out. 1 think the liquor inter
ests will fight the injunction becaucs
it means too much money to them not
to fight it."
Ashamed of Ciiiidiliniis Here.
"I am ashamed of the conditions
which exist in Columbia toda. I
realise that we have drug stores that
are running wide open ever day. We
realize we have done nothing in the
last twelve mouths, as well as ou
do"
Sonie'bod brought up the question
of beer parties.
Said Maor liatterton: "If the wom
en of this town were a little more in
terested in the mattei, if they would
notif me, 1 would be" mil too glad
to stop such things. We have more
women than we have police officers
If we could get one woman out of
ever five to take an interest in this,
we could stop it If ou see beer un
loaded at a certain house, call me up,
and I will look into it."
One of the women said that a man
had told her he knew of a place in
Columbia where he could obtain all
the liquor he wanted The maor
said such evidence would be good to
present to a grand jury.
Major (Tpliolils Police Force.
Another woman said that she had
been asked how she could expect the
anti-liquor ordinances to be enforced
when ever member of the police
force drank. The major said he did
not believe the officers drank and
would give $30 for proor that they
did.
One of the women volunteered the
inrormation that intoxicating liquor
was smuggled into students' rooms
in suitcases. She said that she had
caught one student in the act and ex
pelled him from her house. Other
women corroborated her statement.
Another woman said she had heard
that punch served at students' so
cial functions was "spiked," and that
both bos and girls get the taste for
liepior in this way. The ma or said
it was up to the mothers to stop
this.
Protest Made Against Svve.irinc.
A -vigorous protest against the
swearing of cadet officers at the Uni
versity cadets was greeted with ap
plause, and the ma or was asked if
he could not stop that He said: "I
have no jurisdiction over them, hut
the women of Columbia ought to cre
ate Mich a sentiment against it that
any professor who swore would have
no job.
(It seems to have been the impres
sion of the complainant against swear
ing that the cadet officers were Uni
versil piofessors )
"I umilil nut .iri ilinm if bit X'ou
can make it awfully uncomfortable.'"
for them. I have heard that some of
those people over there think they
cannot talk or breathe without swear-
ing. Never will I appoint an of ficer, j
as long as I live, that swears. You
should take this up through the news
papers." The next question brought up was
why the ordinance against the use or
cigarettes by minors was not en
forced.
In reply to this the ma or said:
The responsibility is on the chief or
I police, who is elected by the people
and over whom the ma or has no con
trol. Hut I think changes are about
to be made which will improve con
ditions, if women would report to'
me the names of an minors they see
rooking cigarettes, I will stop it." I
Mould Enforce Truum- Rules.
Complaint was made that the proper!
authorities did not enforce the regu-
lalions against truiiac. The maor
acknowledged that ordinances against
spitting on sidewalks and swearing
on the streets were not enforced.
The president read an article in an
attempt to prove that the ISible favored
equal rights ror women. Mrs Ida Jos
l.vn sang a surrrage ballad to the tune
or "Comfii' Through the Rc." Plans
lor ri'-ilistncting Columbia and Tor the
membership campaign were discussed.
Several or the members volunteered
to circulate petitions ror the suifrage
amendment to the state constitution.
It was said that lioone Count would
have to get more than its share of
the V.sr names, because Cole Count
would not do its part. Firt signa
tures have alread been secured on
one petition.
