Lincoln, Neb., April 18. W.
J. Bryan is a candidate for del-egate-a-large
to the Democrat
ic national convention in to
day's Nebraska primaries. It
is regarded certain that he will
be named, though he has paid
little heed to his own candi

nomination of the dry Demo

By United Press. -
Lincoln, Neb., April 18. The moslj
spectacular fight in the Nebraska priv
mary today is that for the Democratic;
nomination for governor. Mayor Chas
iV. Bryan of Lincoln, brother of Wil
liam 3. Bryan, Is the dry candidate
while the wets have concentrated
their vote on Keith Neville o North
Hatte, although W. F. Stoecker, p
Omaha, also Is in the race.
Former Secretary Bryan haa' beeni
in the thick of the fight to rid the,
Democratic party in Nebraska ot what
he designates its ""brewery control.''
"I did not want this question, to
come up at this time when national
issues are to engage our attention,"
said Mr. Bryan in Ids campaign.
"I preferred that it wait a year
But if a child is born at my house I
take care of it. This question is here,
and I intend to take care of it.'
The wets, having control of ih9
Democratic state committee, he said,
declared it was best to let the issue
rest, and then they quietly got busy
and sought to nominate men so as to
capture the nominations in both par
ties for governor and the legislature.
Since they forced the issue, he paid,
he is content to fight it out.
Wets and drys are battling for con
trol in the Republican and Democrat
ic parties.
The selection ot candidates friendly
or opposed to the liquor interests
overshadows all else. When the ntata
prohibition amendment comes up this
fall, the governor and legislators will
decide its fate.
Little interest has been displayed lui
the presidential contest. 1
On the Republican presidential prek
erence ballot are the names ot Henry
Ford, Henry D. Eastbrook, Albert Bj
Cummins and Robert G. Ross.
Nebraska has two favorite sons ast
candidates for the vice-presidential
nominations, for United States sen'
ator, Elmer J. Burkett. Republican
and Governor John H.'Morehead, Dem'
ocrat. Both are expected to receive
their party's endorsement in Nebras
ka. On the Republican ticket there ar
five candidates for the gubernatorial
nomination: Three drys: Judge A4
L. Sutton of Omaha, William Marg
ett of Hastings and Samuel R. McKcl
vie of Lincoln, and two wets: Walter
George of Omaha and C. J. Miles o?
Hastings.
For the nomination for United
States senator, Senator Gilbert M.
Hitchcock of Omaha and Ignatius J.
Dunn of Omaha, are contesting fof
the Democratic nomination. Former
Governor Chester H. Aldrich of IJn
coln and Judge John L. Kennedy of
Omaha are contesting for the Republi
can, nomination, .
