Body of Man Said to Be
Villa on 2-Day Trip From
Desert to Chihuahua City
Officials Skeptical of Bandit's Death, Although Fact
That lie Was Last Seen Heading in Direction
; of Dorja Lends Color to Rumor.
NO INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO INVESTIGATE
War Department Will Accept Formal Declaration by
Carranza That Villa Has Been Killed and Will
Order the Recall of All Troops.
WASHINGTON. April 17. Confir
mation of the death of Kran
cisjo Villa still was lacking tonlKht
loth at the state and war depart
ments and at the Mexican emliasy'.
The only dispatch from American
sources In Mexico tending to lend
color to the report wag a hrlef state
ment from Major Howze of the telev
cnth cavalry, now near l'arrnl, that
lie had information which led him to
believe that tlx) bandit and a small
party of his followers had fled some
iluya uko toward Korja. which is close
to the place where unofficial Mexi
can reports say tho body was found.
The outstanding feature of tho
i day's messages from the border were
reports to the war department that
six Mexicans who confessed to having
taken part In the raid on Columbus,
V. M., had been captured and sent to
Columbus for trial by the New Mexico
state authorities. Another official
report relieved anxtety as to the sup
ply problem for the troops at tho
front. It said the forces now were
fully supplied wlh tho exception of a
small shipment of horseshoes and
clothing, which would go forward to
morrow. An ample supply of gaso
line wus on hand, the messatro said,
lor the motor trucks and aeroplanes.
Tho body supposed to be that of
Villa was said by the last Slexlcnn
reports to be en route to Chihuahua
City. It was pointed out at the war
department, however, that the point
where it was found was nearly two
days journey by wnenn from tho rail
road. That ma'- account for delay in
obtaining confirmation or denial - of
the report that the bandit's career
has ended.
Xo Instructions
If General KunMon and General
Pershing have taken any steps to
mako certain tho Identification of the
body they have dono so on their own
initiative. No instructions to that
end have been sent from Washington
ruber to consult or military com
manders.
This fact may be significant of the
altitude of the state department. It
was intimated today (hut the I'nited
States ftovctnmi-nt might be willing to
m-cept a formal declaration from
General Carranza that Villa had been
1 killed and order the recall of the
T Troops.
Senator Slone. chairman of the sen
nte relations committee, after a hrlef
conference today with Secretary
i iiKor expressed tho view that the
Carranza authorities hardly could
have any object in circulating n re
port of Villa's death unless they ho
lievcd it to bo true. He agreed with
Secretary r.uker and other officials,
however, In accepting the reports of
the finding of Villa's body with ut
most caution. Mr. Hakor took no
pains to hide his doubts, although he
expressed fervent hopes that it should
prove true.
Slay Have C lashes.
It Is admitted generally that every
day the troops remain in Aiexlco in
creases tho possibility of serious
, clashes. While there has been no evi
dence of any opposition lo the move
nients of the American forces by mill
tary or civil officials of tho do facto
government, the l'urral incident lias
served as a warning that the civil pop
uhition und even the troops cannot
always be controlled by those In com
mand. The attack on Major Tomp
kin's command at i'arral came after
cordial relations had been established
with the Cinanza military commau
tier there. The Mexican officers' best
efforts weto unavailing to curb tho
disturbers, many of whom were said
to be his own soldiers. It is known
that tho Washington government
would gladly withdraw the trcop to
morrow if it colli, I consider the ob
ject of the expedition accomplished
In somo quarters the suggestion was
made that reports of Villa's death
might have been circulated for the
ellect on the Mexican people and that
they were not intended lo reach bo
yond the border. It was pointed out
that it would add to tho estimation in
which Carranza military chieftains
arc hold by their own peoplo if they
were ublo to show the body as proof
that tho Americun expedition was un
necessary.
Secretary Lansing would not dls
, cuss tho status of the negotiations
vV.ith the de facto government over
tho recall of the troops. It was In
dicated, however, that official Infor
mation us to the l'urral incident still
was too meager to servo as a basis
for reply to General Carranza's mes
sage about It. Secretary Lansing re
plied to both the noto and the mes
sage were yet to be drafted.
- No NcRollutioiis.
fl It was thought possible, however,
that instructions had hocn sent to
Special Agent. Kodgers, Mexico City,
communicating through him to the do
facto government the willingness of
the I'nited States to enter into the
negotiations for tho recall of the
troops proposed by General Carranza.
The secretary would neither deny nor
affirm that suggestion.

The 1916 Oklahoma Durbar
There seems to be an Impre ssion In
some circles that tho far-famed Okla
luhoma durbar has ben abandoned.
Just how such u report should have,
gotten abroad Is hard to determine,
In view of the huge success of last
year's durbar and the determination
of Tulsans to make It an annual af
fair that in futuiu years It will be us
big a thing as the Ma nil Gras Is for
New Orleuns.
Tho durbar will not bo abandoned;
It is follv to even think of giving it up
after all the effort and money that
has been spent by patriotic citizens lo
Perpetuate it as a strictly Tulsa insti
tution. Some argue thut on account of the
grand operu engagements this fall the
durbar should be foregono for one
season. Hut the durbar and grand
opera arc two entirely separate mat
ters. The opera comes in October,
while the durbar must be held a
month earlier. To a largo extent each
affair will appeal to an absolutely
different class of peoplo. Essentially
the durbar Is a poor man's celebra
tion. It Is rich in lis pageantry, but
ut the same time it is free; It can be
appreciated equally by the poor and
by the wealthy. It Is the greatest In
stitution of Its kind in Oklahoma and
draws thousands of visitors to tho
city.
A prominent Tulsan who Is In the
east on business heard that the dur
bar had been "abandoned" this year
in "favor of" grand opera, and fol
lowing is an excerpt from a letter that
he wrote to The World:
"Tulsa has never had anything
more beneficial and more successful
than tho last two durbars, and to
make them still more beneficial they
must be made 'annual.' Wo have a
reputation for giving a good celebra
tion and I know of nothing that
would bo more short-sighted than
failing to mako it an annual event.
As I have often said. New Orleans
would he little heurd of were it not
for their annual celebration, and
there is no reason why Tulsa cannot
become equally famous. The grand
opera company, giving a performance
In a comparatively small enclosure,

The impression prevails unions mem
bers of the Osuge council that the
sale of producing oil properties of
tho Ilarnsdall Oil company, the
Gypsy company und others, will ut
tract but few bidders and that no
sales may be made. In the event tha
properties are not sold tho Osage
council will consider tho proposition
submitted by T. N. Marnsdull of
Pittsburgh to pay a cash bonus of
$500,000 und a one-fifth royalty, if
given his developed oil holdings and
one hundred thousand acres of un
developed leases.
