SONG EVANGELIST BRAY AND
WIFE LEAD IN ANOTHER GREAT
SONG SERVICE BOOSTER
CHOIR ORGANIZED.
At t lie tabernacle meeting last
night it was announced that a big
"IVooster Choir" would be organized
at 4 p. in., today, to be composed of
girls from nine to fifteen years of
ago. All girls of the city, if eli
gible age, are urged to be present
and take part in the choir. This
choir is to assist in the music of tlu
meeting from now on until the close.
A union prayer meeting was con
ducted by Mrs. Bray at the tabernacle
this afternoon at three o'clock. This
meeting was for everybody, regard
less of age or church affiliation.
Services begin tonight (it 7:43
sharp, when Dr. Williams, the evan
gelist, will deliver one of his strong
est sermons. Tomorrow at three
o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Williams
DR. M. H. WILLIAMS
will give another one of his bible
talks, which will be instructive and
interesting to all. The secretarial
committee will meet immediately
following the services tonight for in
struction. Next Saturday afternoon
Dr. Williams will make an address to
women only, at the tabernacle. Lady
ushers will be provided for this ser
vice. Last night the evangelist took for
his text Jeremiah 23:3 and spoke on
the subject of "Prayer." He told of
the devotion of a Mohammedan and
told of how prompt and serious he
was at his prayers. He said: "In all
Mohammedan cities and towns there
are mosques, or churches, for t':e
adherents of that religion. Five times
each day a caller from the mosuue
calls all the people to prayer. Re
gardless of where the Mohammedan
is. he throws his rug upon the
ground and bows upon it and offers
his prayer. The sight and sound of
the call is fascinating. When the
performance is over, all things stop
and reflect until the prayers are over.
They ore not afraid or ashamed to
pray. The call is a universal invita
tion to pray. Likewise, my text to
night is a universal prayer call.

BERNSTORFF VISITOR
The German Ambassador Hurried to
Washington Last Night from New
York for Conference With Secre
tary Lansing.
Washington, April IS. Count Uorn
storff, t ho German ambassador, who
came here last night from New York
under insi ructions from his govern
ment, discussed the submarine crisis
in general wit li Secretary Lansing
today. It is understood the ambassa
dor has no instructions to discuss the
specific case, but to treat the subje.t
broadly, seeking the viewpoint of the
American government regarding the
present situation.
The communication to the lierlin
government, which was completed
yesterday, is said to be the most dras
tic yet sent by President Wilson. As
he was completing the draft of the
latest note, official word of the en
dangering of two American lives by
an attack on the Russian vessel 1m
perator by an Austrian submarine
was received. A full investigation
was ordered by the state department.
The note prepared by President
Wilson will probably be sent to Ber
lin today. It reviews the German
submarine activity since the Lusi
tania was sunk almost a year ago,
and makes it. plain that only an im
mediate change in the German policy
can make possible a continuance of
the friendly relations between the
two nations. As soon as the note
had been completed, Chairman Stone
of the senate foreign relations com
mittee was called to the White House
for a conference with President Wil
son. The cabinet discussion of the sub
marine question resulted in no change
and the note will go to Germany to
night or tomorrow.
