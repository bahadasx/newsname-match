FIGHT FOR HUMANITY.
Washington, April 17.—In an
address welcoming the Daughters
of the American Revolution, gath­
ered here today for their annual
conference, President Wilson de­
clared that the only excuse Amer­
ica can have for the assertion of
her physical force is that she as­
serts jt in behalf of humanity.
He was speaking of the purpose
of the republic—born to serve the
rest of the world just as much as
itself—and had just said the na­
tion. will have forgotten her tradi­
tions whenever she fights merely
for herself under such circum­
stances that will show that she
fights for all mankind. The presi­
dent was enthusiastically applaud­
ed. When he was introduced by
Mrs. Cumming Story, president
general of the organization, the
audience stood and cheered and
many women waved American
flags.
Washingt{)iti' April 17Hgbe com'
iiiuniculiop YiUch he' has drafted as
the last' woifkof the United States to
Germany oiii the submarine issue was
completed today by President Wilson.
It probably will be dispatched to Ber­
lin tomorrow.
The document reviews Germany's
submarine activities since the Lusi
tania was sunk almost a year ago, and
makes claims that only an immediate
change in the German policy can
make .possible the continuance o£
friendly relations between the two na­
tions.
American Wounded.
As the president was putting the
finishing touches to the note, on
which he and Secretary Lansing have
been working for nearly a week,
official word was received by the
state department that the lives of two
Americans had been endangered by
an attack on the Russian bark Impera
tor by an Austrian submarine, Carl
Bailey Hurst, American consul-gener­
al at Barcelona, Spain, who sent the
report, said the attack was without
warning. One of the American citi­
zens on board was wounded by shrap­
nel fired by the submarine.
A full investigation of the incident
was ordered at once by the state de­
partment. If the consul-general's re­
port is borne out, it is possible repre­
sentations similar to those about to
be made to Germany will be made to
Austria-Hungary. Mr. Wilson was
himself the only one familiar with all
the details tonight, but it was stated
authoritatively that' it was the most
emphatic diplomatic paper he ever ap­
proved.
Attacks without warning by sub­
marine vessels since Germany gave
notice that ships carrying guns would
be considered as vessels of war had
been closely studied by the president
with the resulting conclusion that
promises made by Germany have not
been followed.
Count von Bcrnstorff, the German
ambassador, came to Washington
from New York tonight'. His return
on the eve of the dispatch to Germany
gave rise to considerable speculation
jis to whether he had deceived instruc­
tions from his government which
might, influence the course of the
United States. It' was stated at the
embassy that the ambassador had mo
new instructions, although it was like­
ly he would call at the slate depart­
ment tomorrow with a view to learn­
ing the views of the United States
and informing Secretary Lansing of
those of his own government.

Germans Are
Indicted on
Grave Charge
New York, April 17.—Captain Franz
von Papen, recalled military attache
to the German embassy at Washing­
ton, was indicted by the federal grand
jury today as the organizer and finan­
cier of an alleged conspiracy to blow
up the Welland canal in Canada.
With him also were indicted Captain
Hans Tauscher, alleged agent of the
Krupps in the United States, and hus­
band of Madame Johanna Gadski, the
prima donna Alfred J.. Fritzen and
another man whose name has not
been revealed. It was learned from a
reliable source that the last named
is a prominent German, whose name
lias been mentioned frequently in con­
nection with German propaganda, llis
arrest is expected tomorrow.
Federal officials do not expect to
bring Von Papen to trial. While lie
is no longer immune from prosecution
by the United States civil authorities,
since he ceased to be a member of
the German embassy staff, the offense
with which he is charged is not ex­
traditable under any agreement with
another government.
Clarence R. Hudson, alias Krnest
Schiller, who single-handed seized the
British freightship, Maloppa, ofL'
Sandy Hook on the night of March 2!»,
and compelled the crew to put into
Delaware breakwater, was indicted to­
day for piracy. There wore four
counts in the indictments, and In case
of conviction,-Hudson is liable to life
imprisonment. He probably will b*
arraigned tomorrow to enter his plea,
lie was not brought into court today,
remaining at the county workhouse,
where he has been confined since be­
ing brought to Wilmington, Del.
Frank Simon of Kintyre Spent
Several Weeks Studying
Conditions
SAYS PRESENT POLICY
IS SEROUS BLUNDER
Intervention is the only solution for
the Mexican problem, according to
Frank Simon, president of the Kin
tyre State bank, who was at the Grand
Pacific yesterday. He is on his way
home after spending several weeks at
El Paso, Columbus and Juarez. He ar­
rived at Columbus shortly after the
raid and followed the American troop­
ers for 20 miles when the punitive ex­
pedition started.
"The administration is making a
terrible fizzle of the whole affair," lie
said. We here in the north cannot
understand the temper of the people
in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. If
the federal government would leave
the border situation to these states,
they could handle it.
"It is common knowledge at Colum­
bus that there were only 58 armed
troopers there when the raid was
made and the deplorable lack of pre­
paredness contributed directly to the
number of fatalities and the destruc­
tion of property.
"There is so much red tape and hes­
itation in the handling of the troops,
that it is impossible for the troops

BUB POLICIES
London, April 17.—Today, the date
fixed for the cabinet council to make
a final decision as to whether mar­
ried men should be conscripted, the
attack on the government by newspa­
pers devoted to the cause of conscrip­
tion, reached the climax.
All the government's alleged blun­
ders at Antwerp and in the Darda­
nelles, and in the Mesoptamia,—its
alleged mistakes and delays in con­
nection with munitions and air ser­
vice, were reviewed and contrasted
with the perfect- order reigning in
other countries. The Times military
correspondent printed an article with
an elaborate map, purporting to show
the exact disposition of enormous
forces of German troops massed
along the British front in Flanders
and France, and alleged that Great
Britain is lacking the necessary re­
serves to meet an attack.
These newspapers are advocating
the "overthrow of the inefficient min­
istry," and exhort the members of
padliament not to lose* the op­
portunity in the approaching debate
to compel the government either to
conscfipt married men or resign.
-sA
TEUTONS START
London, April 17.—Again the Ger­
mans have launched a probable in­
fantry attack, extending from the Mo­
use to iDouaiimont and have ibeen
swept back except, where they ob­
tained a looting in ChaulTour, by the.
guns of the French. Heavy cas
palties were inflicted on the attacking
forces along the two and a half
mile battle front.
The Germans have kept up their
heavy shelling of Hill No. !UM, north­
west of Verdun, and the second line
of the French in this region, prob­
ably with the intention of again
throwing their infantry forward in an
endeavor to capture these important,
points—keys to the Verdun position
on the front.
The Germans have poured shells
on the Russian positions along the
IJvina river, at the Ikskul bridgehead
and about Dvinsk, and vigorous artill­
ery duels have been in progress in
the lake region south of Dvinsk.
On the British front in Belgium
and France, the heavy bombardment
by the British .and Germans contin­
ue unabated.,

The big guiin on both sides are in

In Asiatic Turkey, the Russians, on
the E'lack Sea coast, have captured
the town of Surmenah and pushed
farther westward against the retreat­
ing Turks to Arsene Kelessi, less
than twelve miles from the important
fortified town of Trebizond.
The British government hereafter
will regulate the shipment of Ameri­
can packing houses to all neutral
European countries for the period of
the war, according to an agreement
reached between the government and
the packers in the settlement of the
cases arising by the seizure by Great
Britain of cargoes of packers' prod­
ucts.
Throughout the afternoon in the
lobbies of parliament there were ru­
mors of grave cabinet dissention and
resignation of minority leaders who
favored universal service.
Graft in
New York
Commission
Scandal Had Its Start at the
Time of Willard-Moran Fight.
Rickard Made Money Gift
New York,"April ,17.—Interesting
disclosures involving the -integrity of
the state boxing commission have
come to light. On the strength of
these developments it is probable
Governor "Whitman will be asked to
make an immediate investigation.
The scandal is the outgrowth of the
recent' Willard-Moran fight at. Madison
Square Garden. Outstanding in the
disclosures is the allegation that Tex
Rickard, promoter of the exhibition,
sent a money "gift." to Fred A. Wenck,
chairman of the hoxinsr commission,
before the fight was held.
Developments today were:'
Tex Rickard said Jack Carley, one
of Willard's managers, came to him
for money to "satisfy certain influ­
ences downtown." (The office of the
state boxing- commission is at 41
Broadway). Curley, said Rickard,
wanted $500 or $1,000 at the first re­
quest.
Wenck reiterated a former state­
ment that Curley came to him with a
money offer from Rickard. He said
he distrusted Curley and requested
James H. Johnson to set him (Wenck)
right with Rickard.
Rickard says the money was solicit­
ed. Wenck says it was not.
"These people are trying to make
me the goat in this whole thing," said
Wenck.
"I didn't receive any money from
any one either before or after the
Willard-Moran fight. It' Is a lie if they
say so."

REPORTS BASED UPON
LABORATORY TESTS
Object to Raising Water Per­
centage in Flour From 10 2-3
to 13 1-3 Percent
Fargo, April 17.—The spread of
21 cents between No. 1 and reject­
ed wheat is wholly unwarranted
and unjustified.
The actual difference in value
between the two grades of wheat
is only about six cents.
Extensive milling tests conduct­
ed at the North Dakota Agricul­
tural college bear out these find­
ings.
South Dakota and others states
have mstio the same point with
respect to the spread value.
Farmers are losing by present
basis of selling "no grade" wheat
an average of 15 cents a bushel.
Small milling concerns within
the state are being forced out of
business through failure to use
grains employed by large milling
concerns.
Small concerns should be en­
couraged to use lower grade
wheat with High grades, because
•,the^J©wer grad* ,v.' *ve mor$ glu­

Striking Facts.
iForegoing are striking facts placed
before the North Dakota railroad com­
mission at its conference this morning
with Dr. E. F. Ladd. president of the
North Dakota Agricultural college,
out of which conference the commis­
sion members and Dr. Ladd hope to
bring about a change in the present
basis of grain grading, eliminating
the vast margin that now prevails,
and return to the farmers a greater
profit for their low grade wheat.
Employing grains of lower grade,
which thoy have determiner! by their
tests have gieat milling value, the big
milling concerns are netting a great
profit—their product' being sold on the
basis of wheat at the No. 1 price
while, in fact, they are using much
wheat that they purchase for 21 cents
less per bushel.
Tests Are Definite.
Dr. Ladd explained to the railroad
commission members—Messrs. W. H.
Stutsman, W. II. Mann and O. P. X.
Anderson, and Secretary YV. C. Gush­
ing—at' the conference at the Waldorf
hotel here this morning, that exten­
sive tests conducted at the agricultur­
al college during the past few years
had revealed the proportionate mill­
ing value of the several grades ot
wheat.
These findings, said Dr. Ladd, bore
nut findings previously made in South
Dakota, in Canada, and elsewhere—
that the low grade wheats are capable
of producing excellent flour—and that
the actual difference in milling value
between No. 1 and the rejected grades
was approximately six cents—instead
of the prevailing established differ­
ence of 21 cents.
Under these conditions, the farmers
are losing 15 cents worth of wheat
every time they sell a bushel of "no
grade," or rejected wheat.
Should the state sell only a million
bushels of such wheat a year—and
the total is much greater—the loss to
the farmers is $ I .*0,000.
Have Allowed Bigger Difference.
In the South Dakota tests, and in
the Canadian tests, it has been point­
ed out that the difference in value be­
tween the two grades of wheat was be­
tween eight and ten cents—but Dr.
Ladd declares I he North Dakota tests
show the value to be about' six cents.
Supporting the findings of the
North Dakota mill, which is state own­
ed, Mr. Ladd pointed to the fact, that
the government conducts praclicallv
all of its experiments here, maintain
ins two men at the plant all times.
Government officials declare the
North Dakota milling experiment
plant is not only the best in the Unit­
ed States, but' the very best plant of
its kind in the world.
By-products Increased.
At the time the Minnesota grain
grades were established, and under
which the North Dakota grain is sold.
Dr. Ladd pointed out that by-nroducts
such as screenings, shorts, etc., were
worth only from $8 to $12 a ton, while
now such products are worth from $20
to *30 a ton—and the farmer receives
nothing additional by reason of that
increase.
Furthermore. Dr. Ladd declared
that the scientific

Thirty Reported Killed
In New Haven Wreck
Officials Deny Reports
Bradford, Conn., April 17.—Thirty
or more persons were said to have
been crushed to death in a collision
on the New York, New Haven &
Hartford railroad, near here tonight.
The accident occurred at 7:30 o'clock
and four hours later, wrecking crews
were said to have recovered thirty
bodies.
The train was bound from Boston
for New London, and had stopped at
the station when it was run down by
the Gilt Edge express bound from
Boston to New York.
The coach/ was crushed and set
afire, and the flames communicated
to the passenger station and freight
house, and destroyed both buildings.
A hospital train came here from New
London, and medical examiner C. H.
Stanlon, of Westerly, R. I., took
charge of the search for the dead
and injured.
It was stated that there were
known to have benn 37 persons in the
destroyed car, and only six of these
had been accounted for several
hours later. Among those believed
to have been burned to death, was
Miss Clark, daughter of the president
of the Westerly Mills of the Ameri­
Sheldon, N. D., April 17.—'Seeding
has been commenced in this district
and with continued drying weather
every farmer will be in the fields by

Pembina, N. D., April 17.—Reduc*
tion of 50 per cent in the wheat acre­
age is predicted here. Only a little
seeding if any at all, will be done the
present month.

REPORTS OF VILLA'S DEATH HAVE NOT
BEEN CONFIRMED AT WASHINGTON
FAMOUS AUTHOR DROPS DEAD

can Thread company, and W. M. Bar.
ber. also of Westerly.
Vice 'President Walley, of the New
Haven railroad, declared shortly be­
fore midnight that the reports that
thirty or more persons had been
burned to death in the wreck, were
without foundation.
"We are absolutely positive," he
added, "that not more than three
persons were killed, if that many."
Creat confusion followed the colli­
sion and it was long before a definite
idea of the extent of the disaster
coukl be had. After the flames of the
burning cars and buildings died out,
the train yarl was lost, in darkness
and those who went, to the aid of the
ijurcd, worked under great difficulty.
The only telegraph line in the town
went out with the burning of he sta­
tion, and the only communication
with the outside, was by a single tel­
ephone wire. Over this, help was
summoned from Providence and New
lvondon, the former sending a wreck­
ing train and the latter city dispatch­
ing a hospital train.
Estimates of the dread varied
widely, and, in the absence of official
statements, the numbers could not
be determined. At midnight the
ruins were so hot, they could not be
thoroughly searched.

May Accept Formal Declaration
That Bandit Chief
Is Dead
Washington, April 17.—Confirma­
tion of the death of Francisco Villa
still was lacking tonight, both at the
state and war departments, and at the
Mexican embassy. The only dispatch
from American sources in Mexico
tending to lend color to the report
was a brief statement from Major
Howze, of the lltli cavalry, now near
Parral, that ho had information which
led him to believe that' the bandit and
a small party of his followers had fled
some days ago toward San Borja.
which is close to the place where un­
official Mexican reports say the body
was found. The outstanding feature
of the day's mesages from the border
were, reports, to .the war department'
that six Mexicans, who cotifeksed to
having taken part lif the raids dn
Columbus, N. M., had been captured
and rent to Columbus for trial by the
New Mexico state authorities. An­
other official report' relieved anxiety
as to the supply problem for the
troops at the front.
The body supposed to be that of
Villa was said by the last Mexican
reports to be enroute to Chihuahua
City. It was pointed out' at the war
department, however, that the border
where it was found was nearly two
days' journey by wagon from the rail­
road.
If Gen. Funston and Gen. Pershing
have taken any step to make certain
the identification of the body, they
have done so on their own initiative.
This fact may be significant of the
attitude of the state department.
Might Accept Declaration.
It was intimated today that the
United States government might be
willing to accept a formal declaration
from Gen. Carranza that Villa had
been killed and order the recall of
the troops.
It is generally admitted that every
day that the troops remain in Mexico
increases the possibility of serious
clashes. The attack on Major Tomp
kin's command at Parral came after
cordial relations had been established
with the Carranza military command­
er there. The Mexican officers* best
efforts were unavailing to curb the
disturbers, many of whom were said
to be their own soldiers. It is known
that the Washington government
would gladly withdraw the troops to­
morrow, if it could consider the ob­
ject of the expedition accomplished.
In some quarters the suggestion was
made that the report of Villi's death
might have been circulated for the ef­
fect on Mexican people and were not
intended to reach beyond the border.
Refuses to Discuss Status.
Secretary Lansing would not discuss
the status of the negotiations with
the de facto government over the re­
call of the troops.
A recapitulation of the American re­
port of what the expedition had ac­
complished }.nd at what cost, other
than financial, shows the following:
"Villa bandits killed, 70 wounded,
unknown, and prisoners, six.
"American soldiers killed, three
wounded, 13 missing, one."
