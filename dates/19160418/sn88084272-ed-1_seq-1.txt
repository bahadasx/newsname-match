CAMP OP GEN. J. J. PERSHING, at
the Front. April 17. (By way mo
tor nd wireless to Columbus. N
M., April 18 ) The American pursuit or
Villa Is at a standstill because of tl
unprovoked attack upon Ameririn i
alrymen bv tht insubordinate -
of the Carranza girrion at Pin t'
At Gen. Pershing's headquartei ., i
day there seemed no immediate pio--pect
for the resumption of Um chase
for there were numerota7,JBdJeauMn
that a continuation of the pursuit

A stasill party of American officers
was fired upon near here last night,
none of the Americans being injured
This, coming on the heels of other f -ports
of sniping, is responsible for the
belief that the expeditionary command
is confronted with a serious problem.
Villa Report Is Discredited.
A report received here from Carranz v
sources that a Villa colonel, captured
near Cusihulriachic. had promised to
lead a party to a grave in which Villa
was said to have been buried last Fn-daj-,
is generally discredited by rnili
tar authorities here
Carrancistas Call It a Repnlse.
Newspapers published In Chihuahua
city reached here todaj. containing re
ports of the attack upon the command
of MaJ Frank Tompkins at ParraL Ac
cording to these, the Americans were
encamped in the Pl-vza de San Juan,
when, despite the efforts of the Car
ranza officials, the Mexican populace
attacked them with firearms, whereup
on the cavalrymen fought back. The
affair was described as being a repulse
of the Americans since they retired,
finally to Lammos.
The newspapers pointed out that, de
spite the unfortunate occurrence, there
was no friction between the American
commander and the Carranza authori
ties in Parral. both of whom were
working to establisn permanent rela
tions Carrancistas Fight Larnngns.
Reports reaching here today from
Carrancista sources said that a Con
stitutionalist force engaged a Villa
command under "Gen " Larangas, with
in a few miles of this camp two night
ago. two Carrancistas and one Villista
being killed. It was a detachment of
Gen Larangas's force that attacked

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 18.
Brig. Gen. George Bell, jr., report
ing from 1 : Paso to Gen. Funston
gave it as his opinion that, after a
thorough an investigation as he could
make, the report of Villa"s death had
been manufactured Consul Letcher,
who said he had been In com
munication with Cusihulriachic. also
has failed to verify the report
If Fr-incisco Villa is not dead h.
has now an excellent opportunity to
escape in territory far beyond the mot
advanctd of the American detachments
because the punitive forces have pene
trated about as far south as it is pos
sible to go with the present organ!7a
tlon. Official admission that It was
impossible to extend the main line of
communication south of Satevo was
taken today to mean that the field of
operations would be restricted to that
district over which detachments of
cavalry with provisions for one or two
daj-s could ride. Beyond the arc of
that fan. Villa will be safe so far as
the Americans are concerned.
Fall Hack to Sntevo.
Gen Pershing is believed to have ex
plained in detail this phase of the sit
uation in a report to Gen. Funaton and
to have made recommendations that
more effective facilities for the pur
suit of Villa be authorized. The drive
of the three cavalry columns to Parral
and Its environs established the fact
that there is no chance of obtaining
provisions in that region and that
every force sent forward must depend
wholly on the quartermasters with the
main columns for supplies. They were
reported to have fallen back to Satevo
but whether they have started out
again to beat the trails in the dlstrii
beyond has not been told
