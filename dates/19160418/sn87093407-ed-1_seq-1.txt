The "Confessions of a Wife" has proved to be one of the greatest features ever run in any newspaper any
where. Today The Star is pleased to announce thai Theda Bara, who has been writing articles for several days
past in this paper on "The Heart of a Vampire," has consented to continue her articles indefinitely. The Star believes they will prove just as in
teresting, especially to women readers, as the affairs of Margie Waverly in "Confessions." Today, on page 7, Miss Bara tells something about
her early life, and what she likes to eat, and what she likes to wear when not working before the camera.

Committee Holds
Up Preparedness
Program in House
By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON. April IS.—Just what hat bean dona and
what haa not been dona by the aanata and houee on "prspsr
adnata"?
Have any actual RESULTS baan obtained In thla matter of
great national concern T
I have Jutt flnlthed an Investigation of thla subject, and
preparedness, aa congraaa haa dealt with that bualnaaa up to
data, may be tummed up aa followa:
The Mar bill, for an Increated army, haa pasted (he house and la
pending In the «rn#»
The bill for naval Increase ha* been In process of formation In
the natal affairs commute* of the house and annate- four month* of
"hearings ''
The senate la debating and will aoon vote on the Chamberlain t'lll
for increasing the army, thla bill having been substituted (or lite Hay
bill aa It passed the house
The May bill reject* the theory of a federal i continental I armv.
supplementing the regular landing army, and laye the entire
on feieral encouragement ihy subsidies from the federal treasury(
of the *tate ml It la what Representative A P. Gardner call* "the
Utile atate armlet."
In addition to thl*. the home army hill Increases the regilar
atandlng army from 100.000 to 140.000 I approximately I, the Increases
to be added by enlistment* extending over a four-year period
Thl* mean* In effect an Increase in the actual mobile force of
fighting men available In continental rolled Stale* from 35.000 (the
present strength) to about 60.000.
WEAKNESS Of HOUSE BILL
The at ate mllltla. *tlmulated, presumably, by the *üb«ldie* from
the federal treasury. will be relied upon a* a *econd line of defense
The blil attempt* alao to draft the Mate militia Into the federal army
In caae of war. bui whether the mllltla can be ao drafted and made to
aerve under the »»»»•• ral ■Whorlty without fresh volunteering. a* re
quired at prevent, la a question of con*tltutlonal law on which rtm
gressh-nal opinion I* about equally divided
The houte bill I* the result of two Influence*—a committee and
chairman opposed to anv con»lderable Incrssaes In army preparedness
and a powerful atate mllltla lobby which feared the wiping out of the
already decadent mllltla If any auch plan aa Garrison's continental
army were to succeed
The worst featura of the house bill waa revealed when the
houaa rejected the amendment offered by the labor group,
seeking to prevent the use of the faderaliied atata militia In
the aattlement of strikes and labor troublea.
The senate'* army bill (the Chamberlain bill) la similar to the
house bill In seeking first an Increase of the regular standing army;
but Ita Increase would be greater, that Is. from 100.000 (o ISO,OOO.
with certain provisions for federal reserves, of which there are now
none.
FIGHT CONTINENTAL PLAN
The chief re#|iect In which the senalnehlll differ* from the honor
bill Is In Its attempt to establish (he beginnings of a federal volunteer
force not unlike Garrison's continental army Thl* would be enlisted
In the various congressional districts These enlistments would be
under rules made by the prertdent aa commander ln-chlef of the army
and nary.
Thla provision ha* been bitterly fought by the *tale mllltla lobby
and waa saved from defeat on a rollcall by a small margin of favor-
I tng votes. At thla writing the provision Is atlll undu attack In the
senate
The Chamberlain bill also provides for a volunteer reserve, a
regular army reserve and an officers' reserve corps of students trained
In educational Institution* which shall adopt an approved courae of
training.
The Chamberlain bill provides also for mobilizing the lndu"irte*
of the nation for military purposes It creates a technical reserve
forre Like the house bill. It would also provide Increased pay for
the National (liiard and Increase the guard to 2*0,000 enlisted men
and officer* In active service, but the bill does not seek lo federallar
j them or draft them Into the regular army, as does the house bill.
COMMITTEE DELAYS
The Chamberlain bill will be voted on In the senate today The
final army program will be a composite made up of features of the
Chamberlain and May bill*, worked out In the conference committee
and later approved by senate and house.
The most Important alngle Item of accomplishment In the
preparedness program Is the passage thru the senate of the
Tillman government armor plate plant bill. This is pending
in the houss. where there is much sentiment favoring It. as
well aa amendmsnta for the government manufacture of other
war munitions.
The delay In reporting the naval bill Is due In part to the fa-t
that the hou"e naval committee Is "little navy" and ' antl prepared
lie**" In Its majority complexion In fact, the whole subject of naval
,re pa redness the most lni|>ortaiil In the preparedness program I*
being tiliirre l and muffled by committee delay.
BY THEIR VOTES YE SHALL KNOW THEM
• The voters of Seattle last December declared
by their ballots for the principle of a municipally
owned railroad belt line.
THEY GAVE THE PROPOSITION \ MA-
K )RI i V ' >F 10,000 VC >I ES AT THE P< >1 LS.
But enemies of the port commission, by bringing
false issues into the campaign, had planted a
doubt in the minds of sufficient people to prevent
the necessary (>o per cent affirmative vote on a
second proposition, to authorize the commission
to transfer money for project from a special
building fund already voted, where the
money was not now needed. fhe project,
therefore, failed, tho having a majority vote.
Again, in the March election, it polled an easy
majority, but fell a few short of the necessary Co
per cent.
The port commission, meantime, asked the
city council for a franchise for the belt line. The
council granted the franchise. Mayor (iill vetoed
the franchise ordinance on grounds which Cor
poration Counsel Caldwell, in an opinion to the
council, declared unsupported by the law.

SAD TALE OF
DEATH NOW
THOUGHTA
PLAIN LIE
REPORT ON VILLA'S DEATH
EL PASO, April 18.—Gen.
Gavlra, in Juarez, announced
today he had received confir
mation of Francisco Villa'*
death from Gov. Enriquez of
Chihuahua.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex„ April
18.—The American expedition
is toeing the scratch today,
ready for a new start in the
hunt for Francisco Villa.
The Parral incident and the
report, now disbelieved, that
Villa's body had been found,
temporarily delayed the chas*.
Gen. Bell, in El Paso, today
reported to Gen. Funaten Ma
belief that the etory of Villa'a
body having been found waa
manufactured in Juarez.
In dispatchee from Chihua
hua. American Consul Letcher
declared that advices from
Cueihuirachlc failed to men
tion the finding of a body.
Earlier advicea said that
scattered American detach
ments were gathering at Sate
vo for a resumption of the hunt
on a scale conforming to the
communications.
Consul Garrla «ald he had no
fresh news from Cusllmirachlc with
regard to the foody reported to be
that of Villa. He saw no reason,
he said, for changing the belief that
the corpse was Villa's
Garcia asserted Carlos Carranza
found the remains from 30 to 50
miles from the railroad. In a region
reached only by rough trails. The
removal was most difficult.
Perhaps, he said. It might be only
necessary to bring in the head. A
chart of Villa's teeth, taken at K!
Paso, may prove important in
identifying the body.
Pershing has returned to Naml
quipa. mi<lway along the communi
cation lines, where he will be able
to watch the situation more closely,
and better direct the army.
No Vnierlcans are believed to be
south of Santa Cruz.
If Villa is alive and has gone Into
Durango. as reported, the pursuit
is apparently halted.
If the exhumed corpse is not that
of Villa, neither American nor
Mexican authorities have any Idea
of his whereabouts, they admitted.
Mexicans, the only persons who
professed to have direct knowledge
that Villa's body had been dug up.
claimed that the telegraph wires
were down and that this prevents
the receipt of further information.
Their failure to Immediately pro
duce the body for American Identi
fication increased skepticism here,
tho the delay may possibly be due
to natural causes, like slow trans
portation.
MAY WITHDRAW SOON
WASHINGTON, April
drawal of the expedition from
Mexico within the next month is
'likely, maybe without "getting"
Villa.
