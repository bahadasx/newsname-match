to run down Villa in various locali

been seen, are making all speed back
to the region of Satevo. The next
move will depend on Funston and
icneral Funston.
The question whether the body pre

tmerican expedition, following the
arral incident and the withdrawal re
vest from General Carranza was up
lermost in the minds of army chiefs
Dong the border.
General Pershing has loft his ad
duced base at Satevo and returned to
N'amiquipa staff headquarters. At
[famiqulpa, about midway along the
lues of communications, he can keep
closer watch on the situation and
letter direct his army. No American

LONDON, April 18.—The fate of the

the outcome of a final conference on

Rumors were flying that Minister
of Munitions David Loyd George, Sec

Nothing definite was known except
that the cabinet failed yesterday aft

with the ministry badly split and Pre

Lloyd George told his colleagues
that the allies' chances of winning the

large reserves of Germans now

PARIS, 18.—German troops
from five 'jf rent divisions, aggre

yesterda.' jient attack against the
French hi,, east of the Meuse, it
was officially announced today.
In last night's-fighting, the Germans
were partially thrown back from a
first line trenoh they penetrated in
Chauffour forest, northwest of Douau
mont.
The Germans attacked with the
greatest violence on a ragged front,
extending from the Meuse in a south
easterly direction to the Douaumont
Ornes road. German artillery had
prepared the way for the assault by
a drum fire that opened at midnight
and continued without cessation for
twelve hours.
The first blow fell against the
French barriers in the narrow ravine
southeast of Pepper Heights, the
scene of furious fighting ten days ago.

Repulsed in this attack the Ger
mans extended the fighting on both
flanks. One division, advancing from
Talou heights, moved southward
along the west bank of the Meuse,
but came under a heavy fire that
forced an Immediate retreat.
The heaviest blow was struck on
the eastern wing. Gathering up two
divisions, the German commanders
hurled them against the French lines
in Chauffour and Ablain woods, driv
ing southwsrd in an attempt to reach
the Douaumont-Bras road.
The first German attacks were
beaten back before the enemy reach
ed the French trenches. The second
assault delivered by still heavier
forces, carried the enemy Into the
advanced positions and forced the
surrender of a redoubt and its con
nected advanced trenches forming an
exposed salient northwest of Douau
mont village.
The losses on both sides In the
hand to hand struggle In the shell
wrecked woods were very heavy. Un
protected by ravines, the attacking
forces sacrificed men by the hundreds
on small sectors of this front. The
French success reported in today's
communique from the war office ap
parently were against these advanced
posts taken by the Germans yester

WASHINGTON, April IS.—The
cables were expected to carry today
a final declaration to Germany of
America's views on submarine war
fare as conceived and drafted by
President Wilson and Secretary of
State Lansing.
The document, of possible far reach
ing consequences—breaking of rela
tions, perhaps—Is complete. The Ber
lin foreign office is expected to know
its message Thursday night or Friday
morning. The American public prob
ably will read it Friday afternoon, si
multaneous with publication in Ger
many.
Through Senator Stone and others
in congress who handle questions bear
ing on foreign relations, the presi
dent was to communicate today to
congress the nature of his note to
Germany. How confidential was the
executive's statements to Stoue anu
the others remain to be seen.
It has been intimated in the past
that before the president took a final
decisive step that might involve tho
country in war. he would make known
his course to congress.
The cabinet meeting today, thero
was reason to believe, would not be
devoted to consideration of the com
munication. The cabinet members
gave their approval last Friday of
action being taken, the note in rough
form, being laid before them.
That the aliened abuse of the inter
national law and the principles of hu
manity is a continuing, live issue was
brought home, administration leaders
said today by yesterday's news of the
Austrian submarine attack on the
Russian bark lnipcrator. One Ameri
can citizen having been injured by
shrapnel fire, full investigation was
ordered by the state department.
It is still the profound hope of ad
ministration officials that a brf.-ik
with Germany may be avoided. The
communication leaves the way per
fectly clear for Germany to take such
action as will preclude the possibility
iof a further dangerous situation be
tween the two governments.
The president cites not only those
ships attacked during the lust ten
months with Americans aboard, but
also certain neutral vessels of other
nations attacked during the same in
terval.
