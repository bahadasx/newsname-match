- Part qf the $250,000 Jbonds for

making - another direct thoroughfare
across the city- by the aid of Grand

at

.. The plan isto continue this street
through '-, Peqnonnock street into
Grand street. Grand street will then
be continued through th,e old Swords'

approach to the new. bridge. . The
bridge will connect" Grand street with
Arctic street on. the East Side. A
new bridge will be built over Pem
broke Lake, connecting Arctic street
with Grant . street in the East End.
Grant street now-goes over Mill Hill
connecting with Barnum avenue just
beyond - Elizabeth street. ' .
(The City Planning Commission will
be, invited to make suggestion con
cerning the layout' of this thorough
fare. It is proposed to pave the
street with Warrenite and to set out
large numbers of shade , trees along
the parts where there are .no trees.
Uniform, curb and gutter its entire
length. will: also be suggested. , At
Pequonnoek street and Maplewood
avenue it will be " necessary to take
private ,. property either by sale or

proposed to reduce the grade of Grand

The opening of euch a street will
relieve- traffic conditions materially

city over which motorists passing
through, may go without being sub

that the railroad company will soon
elevate itsracks on. the Berkshire di

Bridgeport machinists; will flght the
bonus system in local factories this
spring and summer. On the ground
that the system is a device instituted
to deceive, an. effort will be made to
eliminate It from Bridgeport .shops.
George J. Bowen, business agent of
Local No. 3 0, I. A. Ha., said this morn
ing that the bonus system is deceptive
and unfair. "Workingmen are led to
believe that they are getting some
thing substantial," declared Mr. Bow
en, ""but in reality Nthey ' are beguiled
into speeding up on the promise of 10
per cent or thereaboutsbonus.
'. "Some of those who haven't thought,
fail to remember that the bonuses that
are being paid in Bridgeport are
merely for these rush times, and. that
when - a "calm 'settles, they will be tak
en away." The men will experience
the same effect then as if they re
ceived a cut in wages." What we are
working for .is the substitution of a
wage increase for the bonus, so the
men will be protected in dulj times.
, "This doesn't reior. to tiebonus
called tine and onehalf, paid for over
time work or to the extra-pay -received
by the night workers. It is for the
day men we ask a standard rate of
wages. with no. bonus, but, of course,
time and one-half for overtime."
The campaign of the machinists for
10,000 members, which.is expected to
take all summer, is' going forward
merrily. . The secondary- campaign for
S,fl 00 new members by May 1 is pro
gressing favorably. The Plaza theatre
has been engaged for April 30 when
it is expected 1,500 new members will
be. initiated. : . - " '

Heirs Prevent Mrs. Florence
-Walter From Getting
- Money Willed Her:
i A temporary injunction was granted
in the superior court this morning- restraining-
Adrian Rockett-executor on
he Ella . Keppy estate; from turning
over any property to Florence - Keppy
Walters under penalty of $15,000. The
injunction was eigned by Judge Webb
after the facts had been stated by
Judge Carl Foster, njho asked for the
injunction' on, behalf of Maude Wheeler,
and Jesse IX D. Keppy, heirs of the
Ella Keppy estate. ,-, ':
. The heirs recently won a victory in
the superior court when a Jury brought
in a verdict in favor of breaking Ella
Keppy's will. Maude Wheeler - and
Jesse L (.IX Keppy were aggrieved be
cause their mother left the bulk of her
estate to her daughter Florence. It
was alleged that Mrs. Keppy was not
mentally competent and that Florence
Walters used undue influence to in
duce her mother to will certain prop
erty to her. -
Since the trial counsel for Maude
Wheeler and Jesse L. D. Keppy,
learned" that in addition to the will
made by , Mrs. Keppy, she had also
made ah assignment to Florence. It
was also discovered that ' after the
jury trial Adrian Rocket has been
twrning over some property Xo Flor
ence Walters. Heclaimed he had a,
right to do this under the assign
ment but Judge Foster declared that
if Mrs. 5 Keppy was incompetent to
make a will she was also incompetent
to make an assignment,
.The property RockettVas giving to
Florence Walters came to him as a
partial distribution of the estate of
Josephine Mackay of Darien. The late
Ella Keppy had a bequest of about
$15,006 from thi3 estate and this
formed the principal part of Ella
Keppy's estate. After the jury found
in favor pf 'breaking Mrs. Keppy's
will, Rockett took an appeal to the
supreme court. As this is still pend
ing the other, heirs wanted to prevent
the distribution of the estate in the
meantime. ,
