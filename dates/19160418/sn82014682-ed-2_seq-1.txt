: HEADQUARTERS, U. S. EXPEDITION IN MEXICO, April
J8. The long chase after Gen. Villa, involving thousands of American
troops now stretched out over nearly 400 miles of line, has been abrupt
ly halted by the unprovoked attack on the American troops at Parra.
' Growing out of this clash also, or possibly brought sharply at
tention by it, is the increasing animosity against the Americans dis
played by Mexican soldiery and civilians.'. . e
It'appears that there is no immediate prospect of a resumption of
the chase after 111a, while there are numerous indications that such
a chase would : meet with armed resistance on the part of Mexican
forces now at least not opposing the'U. S. cause. . ,'i.;c
1 A small party of American officers was fired upon near the U. b.
camp on Sunday night, -according to the report which reached here
today. This news, coming upon the heels of other reports of sniping
at the American soldiers by hidden Mexicans, is responsible for the
prevalent belief that the members of the expedition are facing a serious
problem in the agitation' growing against them. ;- V '
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 18.-Gen. Bell expressed the opm:
ion today from El Paso that the report of .Villa's death was manufac
tured at. Juarez. ' : -'--:- , 'l'-' 1
1 WASHINGTON, T). C, April 18. The cabinet today held a
meeting at which the Mexican policy was discussed, but after it was
