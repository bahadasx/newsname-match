BRADFORD, R. I., April 18.
Driving through a thick fog, the
Gilt Edge Express, west bound,
on the New York, New Haven 4
Hartford railroad, smashed into the
rear of a local passenger train that
had come to a stop at the station
here last night. The rear coach
was telescoped and set on fire and
at least - seven of the passengers
were killed. An eighth victim died
later from injuries. Thirty-five
other received injuries and in
some cases it was feared that death
would follow.
Early today a search of the ruins
was being made and it was be
lieved that other bodies would be
found.
The engineer of the local train
said that he had trouble in making
steam, and when he arrived at
Bradford he wired to New London
for instructions. He was told to
draw on to a siding at Bradford
to let the express pass and was
just moving his train from the
'main track whe nthe express bore
down upon him.
The accident occurred at 7:30
o'clock, and four hours later
wrecking and hospital crews were
said to have recovered thirty
bodies. 1 q
The dead were in the rear car of
a four-coach local train, bound
from Boston to New London, and
which had stopped at the local sta
tion when it was run down by the
Gilt Edge Express, bound from Bos
ton for Nsw"York.
This coach was telescoped, set
afire and burned. The ear ahead
also took fire and the flames com
municating to the passenger sta
tion and frtight house, destroyed
both buildings..
It was stated that there were
known to have been 37 passengers
in the destroyed car and that only
six of these had been accounted
for several hours later.
Among those believed to have been
burned to death were Miss Jane T.
Clark, daughter of William Clark, presi
dent of the Westerly Mill of the Amer
ican Thread company, and W. M. Bar
ber, also of Westerly.
Vice President Whaley, of the New
Haven railroad, declared shortly be
fore midnight that reports to the effect
that thirty or more persons had been
I hi rued to death in the wreck at Brad
ford were without foundation. '
"We are absolutely positive," he
added, "that not more than three per

Idea of the extent of the disaster could

cars and buildings died out, the train
yard was left in darkness and those
who went to the aid of the injured
worked under great difficulties.
The only telegraph lines In the town
went out of commission with the burn
ing of the station, and the only com
munication with the outside was by a'
ingle telephone wire. Over this help
was summoned from Providence and
New London, the former sending a
wrecking train and physicians and the
latter city dispatching a hospital train.
Estimates of the dead varied widely
and In the absence of a positive offi
cial statement the number could not
be determined at midnight. At that
hour the ruins of the burned cars were
till so hot that they could not be
thoroughly searched. Four bodies were
early removed and a count of those who
received medical treatment showed that
35 who escaped death were injured. It
was thought several of these would die.
A brakeman of the local train said
thut there were 37 passengers in the
rear car and that he had been able to
locate only seven of these. This gave

forecast by Secretary Baker today In
announcing a general shaking up of
the flying branch of the army by

SEPARATE CORPS FOR AVIATION
Communication Which Will
Present Final Word on
Submarine Issue is Com
pleted and Will be Dis
patched Today
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 17 The com
munication which is to be the last
word of the United States to Ger
many on the submarine issue, was
completed by President Wilson today.
It probably will be dispatched to Ber
lin tomorrow.
The document reviews Germany's
submarine activities since the Lusi
tania was sunk almost a year ago,
and makes clear that only an im
mediate change in the German policy
can make possible the continuance of
friendly relations between the two na
lions.
As the president was putting the
rinisning touches to the note, on
which he and Secretary Lansing had
been working for nearly a week, of
ficial word was received by the state
department that he lives of two Amer
icans had been endangered, by an at:
tack on the Russian bark Imperator,
hy an Austrian submarine. Carl Bai
ley Hurst, American corsul general at
Barcelona, Spain, who sent the report
said the attack was without warning.
One of the American citizens on
board was wounded by shrapnel shells
fired by the submarine. A full in
vestigation of the incident was ord
ered nt once by the state department.
If the consul general's report is borne
out, it is probable that representa
tions similar to those about to be
made to Germany will be sent to
Austria.
As soon as the president had fin
ished the communication to Germany
he directed that Senator Stone, chair
man of the senate foreign relations
committee, be invited to the White
House, in order that he might be
informed of the intentions of the ad
ministration. Senator Stone probably
will see the president tomorrow morn
ing before the cabinet meeting.
Mr. Wilson himself was the only
official familiar with all the details
of the document tonight, but it was
learned authoritatively that it is the
most emphatic and vigorous diplo
matic paper the president ever has
approved.
Attacks without warning by. sub
marines on merchant vessels "since
Germany gave notice. Unit ships car
rying guns would be considered br
vessels of w.w have been closely
studied by the president with the re
sulting conclusion that promises made
by Germany have not been followed.
When the preparation of the case of
the United States was begun it wa?
found that sixty-five vessels have
i"en reported officially and unof
ficially ' as having been attacked
without warning by German subma
rines within the past few weeks. Of
ficial reports have not confirmed nil
these incidents, however, and there
fore all will not be included.
The attacks on the channel steamer
Sussex, carrying more than a score
of Americans has been included in
the evidence on the United States as
one of the strongest proofs of Ger
many's failure to adhere to her prom
ises.
Official reports from Berlin that
Germanv was willing to mpet the
United States "more than half way"
have encouraged official here to hoie
that the German government moy
make concession at the last moment
which may pi event a break. The
president, however, was reported to

Recommendations -of the court
martial which tried Lieutenant Col
onel Lewis E. Goodier judge-advocate
of the western department were ap
proved, . as were those of a special
board of officers appointed to inquire
into the whole question of discipline
and conduct of the aviation section
of the signal corps. These steps were
taken:
Colonel ' Goodier was censured by
President Wilson as commander-in-
chief of the army, for having failed
"to observe the attitude which his
officers and seniority of rank re
quired him to observe among junior
officers."
Secretary Baker censured Brig
General George P. Scriven, chief sig
nal officer of the army, "for his fail
ure personally to supervise the dis
clplinary features of aviation corps
administration."
Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Reber,
chief of the aviation section, signal
corps, was relieved from that duty
and censured by Secretary .Baker "for
disrespect to a co-ordinate branch of
the government, failure to observe
the restraints imposed by law with
regard to the personnel and pay of
members of the aviation section" and
for other reasons: and, the appoint
ment of a committee of the general
staff' to study the reorganization of
the aviation section was directed by
Secretary Baker.
Colonel Goodier's case was only in
cidental to the general shake-up of
the nviation section, although hear
ings in that trial, held at San Fran
cisco several months ago, served to
call attention to the conditions- that

Again the Germans have launched a
powerful infantry attack against the
French positions extending from the
river Meuse, to Douaumont, and again
they have been swept back, except
where they obtained a footing in a
small portion of the Chauffeur wood,
by the guns of the French. Heavy
casualties were inflicted on the at
tacking forces along the two and a
half miles battle front.
Tho Germans have kept up their
heavy shelling of hill 304, northwest
of VerdJn, and the second lines of
the French in this region, probably
with the intention of again throwing
their infantry forward in an endeavor
to capture these important points,
keys to the Verdun position on tho
west.
Elsewhere along the lines held by
the French there have been only
bombardments and mining operations.
Numerous German positions have
leen bombed by French aircraft.
On the British front in Belgium and
France the heavy bombardments by
Ihe British and Germans continue un
abated. The artillery activity in the
sector between St. Eloi and the Ypres-
Commines, has been especially marked.
The Germans have poured shells on
the Russian positions r.long the Dvlna
river at the Ikskull bridgehead and
about Dvinsk. and vigorous artillery
duels have been in progress in the
lake region south of Dvinsk.
In Galicia, along the river Stripa,
thf Teutons have made several at
tempts against Russian trenches, but
all of them were repulsed according
to Pctrograd.
The big guns on both sides are in
rction at most of the Austro-Itallati
fronts. In the Sugnnn valley the Aus
trian delivered attacks against the
Italians from the Larganza torrent to
Mont Collo, but they were everywhere
repulsed.
In Asiatic Turkey the Russians ort
the Black Sea coast have captured the
town of Burmeneh and pushed farther
westward aarainst the retreating Turks
of Arsene Kelessi, less than 12 miles'
from the important fortified town of
Trebizond.
The Russians are anticipating no
easy conquest of Trebinzond, accord
ing to unofficial advices from Petro

the present number of troops avail
able. He also said that operations
further south were impossible unless
authority was obtained for the es
tablishment of a new border base, the
free use of railroads or the material
strengthening of the forces now in
Mexico. He said that in strengthen
ing the line to Satevo, the maximum
of its elasticity had been attained.
Detached columns of cavalry are
operating south of Satevo but only so
far as rations for man and horse
can be carried. The three detach

miles from Parral, now have left

The attack was made while the

The Mexicans made a series of at

period of about twenty minutes. The
first attacks made upon the forward
truck were slight and ineffective. But
after being driven off the Mexicans
returned, apparently believing that
they could succeed in cutting off the

WASHINGTON, April 17. Confirm
ation of the death of Francisco Villa
still was lacking tonight both at the
state and war departments and at the
Mexican embasy. The only dispatch
from American sources in Mexico tend
ing to lend color to the report was a
brieP'statement from Major Howze, of
the Eleventh cavalry, now near Parral,
that he had information which led him
to believe that the bandit and a small
party of his followers had fled some
days ago toward San Borja, which is
close to the place where unofficial
Mexican reports say the body was
found.
The outstanding feature of the day's
messages irom me uo.u -
t u-ut Hpnartmpnt thut six Mexi-
cans who confessed to having taken
part in the raid on Columbus, N.
had been captured and sent to Colum
bus for trial by the New Mexico state
authorities. Another official report re
lieved anxiety as to the supply problem,
for the troops at the front. It said the
forces now were fully supplied, with
the exception of a Email shipment of
horse shoes and clothing, which would -go
forward tomorrow. An ample sup
ply of gasoline was on hand, the mes
sage said, for the motor trucks and
aeroplanes.
The body supposed to be that of ilia
was said by the last Mexican report to
be enroute to Chihuahua City. It was
pointed out at the department, how
ever, that the point where it was found
was nearly two days' journey by wagon
from the railroad. That may account
for delay in obtaining confirmation or
denial of the reports that the bandit's
career has ended.
If General Funston and General
Pershing have taken any steps to make
certain the identification of the body
they have done so on their own ini
tiative. No instructions to that end
have been sent from Washington,
either to consuls or military com
manders. This fact may be significant of the
altitude of the state department. It
was intimated today that the United
States government might be willing to
accept a formal declaration from Gen
eral Carranza that Villa had been
killed and order a recall of the troops.
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, after
a brief conference today with Secre
tary Baker, expressed the view that
the Carranza authorities hardly could
have any object in circulating a report
of Villa's death unless they believed it
to be true.
He agreed with Secretary Baker and
other officials, however, in accepting
the reports of the finding of Villa's
body with utmost caution. Mr. Baker
took no pains to hide his doubts, al
though he expressed a fervent hope
that it should prove true.
It is generally admitted that every
day that the troops remain in Mexico
increases the possibility of serious
clashes. While there has been no evi
dence of any opposition to the move
ments of the American forces by mili
tary or civil officials of the de facto
government the Parral incident has
served as a warning that the civil pop
ulation cannot always be controlled by
those in command. The attack on Ma
jor Tompkins' command at Parral came
after cordial relations had been estab
lished with the Carranza military com
mander there. The Mexican officers'
best efforts were unavailing to curb
the disturbers, many of whom were
said to be his own soldiers. It is known
that the Washington government would
gladly withdraw the troops tomorrow if
it could consider the object of the ex
pedition accomplished.
In some quarters the suggestion was
made that reports of Villa's death
might have been circulated for the ef
fect on the Mexican people, and they
