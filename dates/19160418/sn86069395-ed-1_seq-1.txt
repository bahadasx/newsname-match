There arc only 503 veterans of the
Mexican war of 18-16-48 now living.
V- Germany is at her old trick of re
oortinp Russia's loss and concealing
her own.
The Panama Canal was reopened
Saturday, 16 ships passing through
the first day.
Jas. S. Jett, a former Kentuckian,
celebrated his 97th birthday in St.
Louis last week.
The Parral attack was not only un
provoked, but in treacherous audaci
ty was un-Parral-leled, except by
Villa's raid.
Argentfnc aviators are attempting
to fly over the Andes at a point where
the elevation is 20,000 feet, which
would establish a new altitude record.
Forty per cent of all the coffee is
consumed in this country. Last year
1,000,000,000 pounds were imported,
ten pounds to every person in the
United States.
Geo. W. Peck, former Governor of
Wisconsin, and editor of Peck's Sun,
at Milwaukee, died Sunday, aged 74
years. "Peck's Bad Boy" made him
famous as a humorist.
The one thing that the Republicans
are hoping to see the President do is
to again haul down our unsaluted flag
jfcf in Mexico before we catch Villa and
'-Spread the riot act to Carranza, whose
insolence is becoming unbearable.
Ludlow F. Petty, of Shelby county,
who has been elected chairman of the
Republican Committee of Kentucky,
is an anti-Fairbanks man. Tho com
mittee while in session decided that
the dispute in this county over organ
ization should be settled by the elec
tion of committeemen.
The good roads election in Todd
county has been called for June 10,
at which time a bond issue of $190,
000 will be voted on. Eight commis
sioners will be chosen and the funds
will be divided equally between the
north and south halves of the county,
following the plan adopted in- this
county.
Gen. Pershing has at last reported
that the attack on Americans at Par
ral was unprovoked. A few unarmed
American soldiers were sent into
town to buy supplies. They were
fired upon and two killed. The sur
vivors retreated to the camp outside,
pursued by Mexicans, whose fire was
returned nnd 40 killed.
In Berlin alone 900,000 women have
taken the places of men in every line
of manual labor. Many of them are
required to wear bloomers, where
skirts would be troublesome. In some
of the trades they soon suffer in
health, tho women being unable to do
tho heavy work they have attempted.
If Carranza insists that wo limit the
extent of our pursuit of Villa and
make tho time spent in Mexico "reas
onable," lot's do it. Let the limit to
the pursuit be the Pacific ocean and
the length of occupancy be only as
long as is necessary to catch Villa and
the other bandits who have shed
American blood.
Diir vlitnrinl friend. Col. Loviiifr
W. Gaines, mayor of Trenton, has
issued an eloquent proclamation for
civic improvement, among other
things calling upon tho ladies to spend
tho day on their front porches
"wearing a smile." The mayor is no
doubt assuming that April 20 will bo
a warm day. If wo should happen to
have another snowstorm, a smilo
would not be enough to wear, Colonel.

CLAIMS HAS
TOBODY
Is Disinterred After Having
Been Buried For Two
Weeks.
WILL THE SCHEME WORK
One of His Men Captured Al
leged to Have Pointed
Out the Grave.
El Paso, Tex., April 17. Francisco
Villa is dead and his body disinterred
some days after his burial, is in pos
session of the Carranza troops, ac
cording to a series of telegraphic
messages received in Juarez Sunday
by the Mexican officials.
Only one message was received in
Juarez giving details of the supposed
finding of Villa's body. This mes
sage was unofficial. According to it
Villa's death and burial were revealed
by a former colonel of the bandit band
who had been captured and was un
der sentence of death and agreed to
disclose the grave for his life.
When the body was exhumed one
leg was said to have been swollen to
enormous size and to be in such a
gangrenous condition that there was
no doubt as to the cause of death.
One question which has been seri
ously discussed among Americans
here is the possibility that a mistake
may have been made in the identity
of the body exhumed.
DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFICATION
It was pointed out in the climate of
northern Mexico decomposition sets
in very rapidly and that positive iden
tification of a body which had been
buried some days, especially in the,
case of a man who had died from
blood poisoning, would be very diffi
cult. The doctors who treated Villa
here, however, express confidence in
their ability to identify his remains if
they are brought to Juarez.
MEXICO CITY CONFIRMS.
Mexico City, April 17. Villa's dead
body has been dug up out of a two
weeks' old grave by Carlos Carranza,
nephew of Gen. Carranza, the first
chief of the constitutionalists, and is
now being brought by him and an es
cort of soldiers to the city of Chihua
hua. This information was contained in a
telegram received by the war depart
ment late. Sunday afternoon.
HENDERSON
ELECTION
Action of Fiscal Court Will
Defeat Bond Issue at
Polls, Is Prediction.
Henderson, Ky., April 14. Elec
tion notices were issued by SherifT
Trigg today summoning the election
officers to hold the bond issue elec
tion on April 29 in all the thirty-ono '
precincts of the city and county. j
A petition has been presented to
County Judge Young requesting that
the election be called off, but Judge
Young has discovered there is no
law to recall an election, once it is
ordered. It is considered positive
that the bond issue will bo defeated
by an overwhelming majority, and
citizens of tho county who petitioned
tho judge to call the election now
want to savo the county the expense
of tho election, which will cost about
$500. i
Because of tho fact that tho fiscal
court refused to name a commission
to handle tho proceeds of tho bond
Issue, many voters will cast their bal
lots against the Issue. j

Here are some clean-up hints for
householders:
Garbage This is food waste only.
Always keep it in a metal can with a
tight cover. Do not let flies get into
it.
Rubbish This includes ashes, bot
tles, tin cans, junk and house sweep
ings. Always keep it in boxes or
barrels of average size.
Waste Paper This should be kept
from rubbish. Always keep it dry.
Put in burlap bags or tie it up in
bundles. If kept in basemcni it
should never be kept near the fur
nace nor under the stairs.
Vacant Lots The owners of vacant
lots arc responsible for keeping
them clean. Do net throw your rub
bish or garbage in these lots. It is
not good citizenship and is a menace
to your health. Try to get them
cleaned up and see if you can put in
a garden.
Fire Dangers Clear out all waste
paper and rubbish of any kind in
your attic or basement. Never block
ade fire escapes, halls or stairways.

TRENCHES FOR THE FORTS
No Real Breach Made in the
French Lines to Date,
Says Paris.
London, April 17. Without dimin
ishing in intensity, the battle of Ver
dun is entering into its ninth week.
The Germans under the Crown Prince
first launched their attack against the
French fronton February 21. The
loss in killed and wounded on both
sides as nearly as can be estimated
has reached 400,000. The French in
their defense have abandoned the old
fortified positions for a maze of
trenches, and against these the Ger
mans have thrown assault upon as
sault. With an enormous outlay of
men and ammunition the Germans
have so far succeeded in taking about
100 square miles of territory, but as
yet have not made any breach in or
been able to pierce the French line.
Fort Douaumont, taken early in the
offensive, and Bethincourt are the
two most important positions the Teu
tons have gained. The French evac
uated Bethincourt.
An assault against German trenches
in the region of Douaumont resulted
successfully, according to Sunday's
Paris War Office statement. Artillery
duels prevailed along the rest of the
front.
The British force made some gains
after the explosion of two mines
against the German trenches.
The Berlin statement contradicts
the claim of the French at Douau-.
mont and says that all the French at
tacks at that point were repulsed.
The Germans heavily bombarded
French positions in the Avocourt wood
and on Hill 304.
The Turkish Government admits:
that one of its submarines sank the
Russian hospital ship Portugal in the '
Black Sea last month, when 113 per-1
sons were drowned. Turkey main-'
tains that the commander and other i
officers of the submarines were justi
fied in believing that the vessel was a
transport.

CHRISTIAN
ONE COUNTY
In Kentucky That Is Working
Out The Standardization
Problem.
IN POULTRY MATTERS
White Wyandottes Will Soon
Be Sought as Christian
County's Breed.
The work done in Christian county
last week by Profs. A. S. Chapin and
D. D. Slade representatives of the
Federal and State Departments of
Agriculture, co-operating with Mrs.
Eloise Graves and County Agricultu
rist Casey was a work from which the
county will derive much benefit not
only in a material way but in an edu
cational way.
The children of the county schools
are showing unusual interest along
the lines of pure-bred stock and this
interest once started in children will
also be manifested in other, lines of
farm animals. This is the aim of the
Department which seeks to interest
the children in the tilings on the farms,
diverting their interests from the
cities. Nearly every section of the
county was visited and in every sec
tion the same interest was found
among the school children. These
men will return to the county in June
and take up the work again.
Saturday Prof. Chapin was a visitor
to the Kentuckian office and in speak
ing of this work said: "The only
county in the United States that is
standardizing its poultry interests
through the Boys' and Girls' Clubs
and the County Agent is Christian.
Washington has instructed me to give
all necessary help to the plans, for they
are deeply interested in the reports I
have made about the work." Con
tinuing he said: "The state depart
ment in charge of adult work, is
equally interested and Prof. Slade, in
charge of this work under this de
partment is doing all in his power for
Christian county. When we meet
here in June our time will be spent
on the farms where White Wyandotte
chickens are being raised."
Prof. Chapin is thoroughly in love
with Christian county and says that he
has never come in contact with a peo
ple who arc so much interested in
each other's work, especially the town
people being interested in the doings
of the country people. He is
delighted with the material as
sistance being given by the town
people and says that the result will be
that Christian county will soon be
come famous not only as a market for
standard bred White Wyandotte
chickens and eggs in almost any
quantity, but also as an oxample of
what unity of purpose mains in the
the way of financial return to the peo
ple generally.
Already, dealers in poultry, are of
fering to pay a premium for poultry
and eggs of stnndard varioty, color
and size and the Kentuckian predicts
that the Christian county product will
be in demand by eastern dealers and 1
consumers.

HANS
MADE ATTACK
Two Americans and 40 Mex
icans Killed in the
Clash.
RETREATED FOR 8 MILES
Little Band of 100 Reset by
300 Carranza Regu
lars. San Antonio, April. 17. It was a
force of Carranza men who engaged
the little detachment of American
cnvalryat Parral Wednesday in a reg
ular organized action, according to
detailed reports written by Major
Frank Tompkins and forwarded to
Gen. Funston by Gen. Pershing.
Forty of the Mexican soldiers, in
cluding one major and one civilian,
were killed by retreating Americans.
The American casualties were two
killed and six wounded, includinir
Maj. Tompkins. His wound was
slight.
Maj. Tompkins account of tho ac
tion was received at Gen. Funston's
headquarters tonight and served to
clarify Gen. Pershing's report re
ceived yesterday in which the identity
of the attacking force was not stated
and in which he left the inference
that the cavalry was under Col. W. C.
Brown.
The Americans are now north and
west of Parral, reinforced by a squad
ron of the tdith under Maj. Young,
accompanied by Col. W. C. Brown
and a picked squadron under Maj.
Robert L. Howze. Fear for their
safety has been dispelled by this re
port and by dispositions of troops
that Gen. Pershing has ordered but
the character of which Gen. Funston
did not wish to reveal.
Maj. Tompkins' story of the fight
indicates lack of control over the
troops by the commanding officer of
the Parral garrison, Gen. Lozano, and
bitter antagonism by the public and
troops. The fighting took place out-
Iside of Parral and was continued over
' a route of eight miles.
FUNSTON REGRETS RETREAT
Gen. Funston said tonight that
while Maj. Tompkins undoubtedly
acted in accordance with his best
i judgment in retreating, he regretted
I that he had not made a stand on ai -
'count of the ill effect the story of his
retreat would have on the Mexican
1 people.
j Mnj. Tompkins arrived outside Par
ral on the forenoon of April 12 with '
about 100 men of trotips M and K of
t the Thirteenth cavalry. He marched
his small detachment quite openly
along the trail into the city, where
they were met by Gen. Lozano and
, civil authorities, who received them
most graciously.
i Mnj. Tompkins entered tho town
upon the invitation of an officer of the
Parral garrison, lie stated that tho
officer met him ten miles from Parral,
introduced himself and- urged him to
accept the hospitality of tho civil au
thorities. This fact coupled with Maj.
Tompkins' report of the subsequent
attack, caused officers here to express
the opinion that he and his men had
been led into a trap, although perhaps
not with the knowledge of Gen. Loz
ano, commanding officer.
