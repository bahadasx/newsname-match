EVANGELIST I
HOLLISTER DOES
MOREPREACHING
"Tho Devil virtually took God's
throne," Bald Evangelist M. A., 'Hoi
lister, at the Seventh. Day Advcntlst
church; "when ho succeeded ln'por
suadlng tho protestant world to ac
cept Sunday keeping for Sabbath
keeping," then reading from Neh.
13:15-17 where tho record says .that
labor of all kind Is evil when (per
formed upon tho Sabbath, even as
tho fourth commandment says, ,and
from Ezek. 46:1, 'and Luke i,3;14
when the bIx working days aro men
tioned as being other than tho Sab
bath, tho speaker asked the question,
Whero In the Law can you find a
statement which says that labor upon
Sunday Is sin? When Sunday Is ono
of thoso six working-days upon which
God saya we can labor, and the 4th
vorso of 1 John 3, Bays that, sin Is
tho transgression of the law. Then
very plainly nccordlng to tho Bible
it cannot bo sin to labor upon Sun
day, but when that labor is perform
ed upon the Snbbnth It Is sin.
TliC' speaker said that thero was
not a slnglo Instanco In tho New
Testament when tho Savior or the
descrlplPs ever kept Sunday, but on
tho contrary read of a number of In
stances where they observed tho
Seventh Day Sabbath. Jesus Christ
himself, was the maker of tho Sab
bath, Mark 2:27-28 and gnvo It to
Israel on Mount Slnal, Neh. 0:0-14,
and In Matt. 0:17, said he came not
to destroy tho law, then how could
ho change the Sabbath and Heb. 13:8,
says Jesus Christ is tho same yes
terday, today and forever.
In Mai. 3:0, God Tiays that, If ho
were to change wo would bo consum
ed, thcreforo It 1b plain that no
chango Is mndo by thorn, then the
devil must bo tho ono who did make
tho chango, and wo as Seventh Day
Adventlsts do not bollcvo In allow
ing any such thing to control our
observance of Cod'B law.
Tho speaker continued by saying
that tho subject Tuesday night would
be, tho offer of $1000 for n text for
Sunday keeping, nnd the offer Is still
good. '
