Whether this had anything to do with
Aguayo's release was unknown to
the American as Aguayo failed to

Garcia was formerly a Diaz offi

The rear coach was telescoped
and set on fire and at least seven

S An eighth victim died later from
injuries. Thirty-five others re-
ceived injuries and in some cases
it was feared that death would
follow.
Early today a search of the e
ml iih ivna heimr made and it was
believed that other bodies would

The engineer of the local
train said that he had trouble in
making steam, and when he ar-

before tho interruption to wire serv
ice, was received by the Associated
Press from Consul Letcher sayinK
that nothing was known In the state
capital regarding the finding of the
bandit's remains,
May Re HtKly of Ixipe.
These two circumstances combined
to reinforce the growing skepticism
there an to the truth of the story that
death has ended the career of the
fugitive brigand. The old story that
the man who Is really dead is Pablo
Lopez, the notorious butcher of Santa
Ysabel, and that Villa has deliberate
ly used his death as the liusis of a
talse report of bis own decease, aKain
was revived. This story was retold
today by an American owner of a
large ranch in the Guerrero dis
trict who said he had got it from his
ranch foreman and believed it to bo'
true.
The confidence of Mexican officials
here and In Juarez that Vi'Ia is dead
has not, however, diminished, out
wardly at least. It was pointed out
today that if the body had been
brought to Cusihulrlachic it might
take the better part of a flay to
transport it from there to Chlhuahuu.
The roadbed between these two points
is in a deplorable condition, like that
of all other ,railroads in northern
Mexico- Thera are only three ensines
on the road and all three are In a
very battered and rickety condition
An average of four or five miles an
hour is normal on the Mexican North
cm railroad and Cusihulrlachic is
sixty miles from Chihuahua.'
Confronted With Typhus.
With hopes of Villa's death 'iwin
dllng, attention here was directed to
day to a iar deadlier and more insid
ious foe with which reports say both
Americana and Mexicans are con
fronted. Reports received here today
by the American representative of
large minim? interests in Mexico
stated that typhus fever was raging in
northern Mexico and was assuming
the proportions of a great epidemic,
l'eoiis Are I lei pies.
These reports said that the Mexi
can peons, Ill-nourished and living
under the most terribly unsanitary
conditions, were almost helpless to
resist the ravages of the disease.
There are few doctors in the country
and almost all of the American phy
sicians who formerly lived there havo
fled across the border. The few
Americans who have been enterlns
Mexico from here tn the last few
weeks havo taken the precaution to
carry a supply of bottled water with
them as there Is little water to be
found in northern chihuahua which
It is safe to drink.
In the American refugee colony
here the reports of the spread of
disease and of growing economic dis
tress are declared to be more likely
in more Inadeuuate than exagwer

Washington, April 17. The com
munication which lie has drafted as
the last word of the Cnltcd Stales
to Germany on the submarine Issue,
us completed by President. Wilson
today. It probably will be dispatched
lo Berlin tomorrow.
The document reviews Germany's
submarine activities since the l.usl

and makes clear that only an immedi
ate change In the German policy can
make possible the continuance ,t
friendly relations between the two
nations.

As the president was putting the
finishing touchts to the note, on
which he and Sccrelarv l.anslna hud
been working for nearly a week, of
I flclal word was received by the state
i department that the lives of two
Americans had been endangered by
an attack on the Russian bark Imper
ator. by an Austrian submarine. Carl
Bailey Hurst, American consul gen
eral nt Barcelona, pnin, who sent the
report, said the attack was without
warning. One of the American citi
zens on board was wounded by shrap
nel shells fired by the submarine.
A full Investigation of the Incident
was ordered at once, by the state de
partment If the consul general's
report is borne mil, it Is Probable
that representations slmilur to those
about to be made to Germany will
be sent to Austria.
As soon as the president had fin
ished the communication to Germany,
ho directed that Senator Stone, chair

Wushlnuton. April 17. Confirma
tion of the death of Francisco Villa
J.till was lacking tonight, both at th
I state and war departments, and at
(lie Mexican embassy. The only dis
patch from American sources in
Mexico tending to lend color to the.
tt port was a brief statement from
Major Howie, or the Eleventh cav
alry, now near Parral, that he had
iiifiu ination which led him to believe
that tl,,'- ur.dlt and "a small party of
Ilia followers had fled some days a
towards Sau Francisco Horja, which
ts close lo the place where unofficial
Mexican reports say the hody wa
found.
lU'iMirt From Border.
The outstanding features of the
day's messages from the border wr
reports to the war department that
six Mexicans who confessed to hav
ing taken part In the raid on Colum
bus, N. M. had been captured ami
'sent to Columbus for triul by the)
l
New Mexico stale authorities. An
other official report relieved unx!ty
as lo the supply problem for tha
troops at the front. ' It sutd the force
lu.w were fully supplied, with the ex
ception of a small shipment of horse
hliot und toothing, which would ao
forward tomorrow- An ample supply
of gasoline wan on hand, the mes

The hody supposed t6 be that of
Villa was said by the Inst Mexican
reports to tie en route to Chihuahua,
''. It was pointed out at the war
department, however, that the point
where It wusj found wus nenrly two
days' Journey by wagon from th
raProad. Thut limy account for de
lay In obtaining confirmation or de
nial of the report that the bandit's
career has ended-
Jf General Fun-ston und Generul
Pershing have taken any steps t,
make certain the Identification of
Hie body, they have done so on their
own Initiative, No instructions to
that end have been sent from Wash
Ington, either to consuls or military
commander.
May Tuke Cnrntiia'sj Wolil.
This fact may be slffntfleunt of the,
altitude of the state department.- It
was Intimated today that the United
Slates government might lie willing:
to accent a formal declumtlon from
General Curraiuu, that Villa had been
killed and order tho recall of tho
troops.
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, after
a brief conference today with Secre
tary linker, expressed the view that
Ihe Cnrrann authorities hardly could
have any object in circulating a re
port of Villa's death unless they be
lieved It In be true.
He agreed wit li Secretary Tinker
and other officials, however, In ac
cepting the reports of the finding of
Villa's body wllh utmost caution. Mr,
linker took no pains to hide hi
doubts, ullhough he expressed a fer
vent hope that it should prove true.
Clashes Likely.
It Is generally admitted that every
day that the troops remain In Mexico
Increases the possibility Of serious
clashes. While there has been no
evidence of any opposition to th
movements of the American force by
military or civil officials of the do
facto government, the Purrnl Incident
has reived us i, warning that the civil
population as well as the troops can
not always be controlled by those In
command. The attack on Major
Tompkins' command nt Parral came
after cordial relations had been es
tablished wlih the Carrunzu. military
commander there. The Mexican offi
cers' best efforts were unavailing to
curb the disturbers, many of whom
were said lo be Ills own soldiers. It
Is known that the Washington Rov-.
eminent would gladly withdraw Hv
troops tomorrow if It could consider
the obiect of the expedition accom
plished. 11,'tsnt for Mexicans.
In some quarters the suggestion was
made that reports of Villa's death
UilKbt have I en circulate,, for the ef
fect on the Mexican people and that
they were not Intended to reach the
border. It was point--d out that it
would mid to the estimation In which
C.iiian.a military chieftains are held
by iheir own people, f thoy were ablei
to show the body as proof that the
American expedition was unnecessary.
Secretary Ionising would not dis
cuss the Hiatus of the negotiations
with the de facto government over
the recall of the troops. It was Indi
cated, however, that official informal
lion us t the Parral incident, as well
as oilier Information, still was too
meagre to serv" tis a basis for reply to
Generul t'nrrana s message about it.
Mr. I .n using said replica, to both tho
note nd the passage tvere yet to be
drafted.

that Instructions had been sent to
