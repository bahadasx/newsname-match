San Antonio, Texas. April IS.—
General Hell, reporting from
El Paso to Major-General Kuns
ton, nave it as his opinion, after as
thorough an investigation as he
could make, tliat the report of
Villa's death had been manufac
tured in Juarez. Consul 1 .etcher,
who said he had l>eeii in com
munication with C'usihiiiriachic,
also has failed to verify the it
port .
If Francisco Villa is not dead,
lie has now an excellent chance to
escape into the territory far l»e
--yond the most advanced of the
American detachment, because
the punitive force lias penetrated
about as far south as it is going
to with the present organization.
Official admission that it was
impossible to extend the main line
of communication south of Satcvo
was taken to mean that the lield
of operations would be restricted
to that district, over which de
tachments of cavalry with pro
visions for one or two days could
ride. Beyond the arc of that fan
Villa would be safe so far as the
Americans are concerned.
('amp of J. J. Pershing at thr Front.
April IT (By Motor and Wireless to
CoIUHtbUS, N. M.) April 18. The
American pursuit of Villa is at a
standstill because of the unprovoked
attack upon American cavalrymen by
the insubordinate soldiers of tlie Car
ranza garrison at Parral.
A small party of American officers
was fired upon near here last night,
none of the Americans being injured.
This, coming on the heels of other
reports of sniping, is responsible for
the belief that the expeditionary com
mand is confronted with a serious
problem.
At General Pershing's headquarters
iliere seemed no prospect of the re
sumption of the chase. There were
numerous indications that a continua
lion of the pursuit would meet with
armed resistance.
A report received here from Car
ranza sources that a Villa colonel,
captured near Cusihuiriachic had
promised to lead a party to a grave
in which Villa was said to have been
buried last Friday, is generally dis
credited by military authorities here.
Troops Were Kncainpcd
Newspapers published in Chihuahua
City reached here to-day containing
reports of the attack upon the com
mand of Major Frank Tompkins at
Parral. According to these papers.
Americans were encamped in the plaza
de Sanjuan. when despite the efforts
of the Carranza officials the Mexican
populace attacked them with firearms,
whereupon the cavalrymen fought
back. The affair was described as bc

If President Judge Kunkel yester
day had only consented to liear the
application of City Patrolman John \v.
Hess for divorce from his wife Cath
arine, the records of the Dauphin
county divorce courts would have con
tained some mighty tough evidence of
how "cruel and barbarous" a wife can
be to her spouse.
But the court wouldn't hear the ap
plication. And that, too, is another
story.
John and Catharine, the court de
fined. had never been married, either
in the regularly accepted way or by
"common law" marriage. And. not

couldn't see how they could be di

■So Hess vs. lless in divorce was con
tinued and in the near future Ifess'
counsel, Attorney W. J. Carter, will
ask the court to strike the order of $3
per week for maintenance which was
made last January against John. It
was that order, by the way, that led to
the divorce court.
John contended that he had never
married Catharine and was not liable
