long reports from General Funston

From the Etate department, the

A decision as to what course now
to pursue is to be reached between
the military and diplomatic aspects of
the situation.
General P'unston's dispatches came
last night and are the fullest discus
sion of his problems he has yet sub
mitted. They contain no mention of
the reported death of Villa. That
was the only hint of their contents
Secretary Baker would reveal. The
substance of the messages, the secre
tary said, was beyond the realm of
public discussion at this time. It Is
understood that the reports show
General Pershing's men to be south
now of the farthest southern point
at which Villa's trail has been even
indefinitely located. The pursuit ap
parently is swinging westward into
the more mountainous regions.
Snipers Renew Activities.

Five Dead in
Train Crash
in the East
Bradford, R. I., April 18. A search
of the wreckage resulting from the
rear end collision of two trains on the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
railroad here last night was still in
progress today, in an effort to determ
ine whether it contained any bodies in
addition xo the five persons who are
known to have lost their lives. It was
the opinion of many persons who had
been at the scene during the night
that at least three other passengers
had been unable to extricate them
selves from the burning mass. The
known dead are:
THOMAS BOARDMAX. Westerly.
MIS JEAXETTE CLARK, Westerly,
daughter of William Clark, president
of the Westerley mill of the American
Thread company.
MARGARET BLISS, address un
known. WILLIAM BARBER, Westerly.
MRS. OSCAR MARTELLE, South
Bridge, Mass.
More than thirty other persons were
injured, most of them suffering from
cuts and "bruises or shock.
All the victims were occupants of
the rear car of a local train which had
Btarted to run on a siding in front of
the Bradford station when the Gilt
Edge Express from Boston crashed
into it. Coals from the express loco
motive and the explosion of a gas
tank set fire to the wreckage and the
flames spread so rapidly that the near
by station and freight house were de
stroyed, together with four wooden
coaches of the local train. The pas
sengers had much difficulty in climb
ing out of the demolished cars and
those who lost their lives were badly
burned.

BERLIN GETS
BUSY AS NOTE
IS FINISHED
Germany Suddenly Shows
Great Willingness to Set
tle the Situation.
COUNT WILL CONFER
BernstorfT Has Meeting With
Lansing Paper Goes
Forward Today?
Washington, April 18.
Ambassador Penfield at Vi
enna has been instructed to
inquire of the Austrian gov
ernment regarding the re
cent attack without warning
by an Austrian submarine
on the Russian bark Impera
tor, carrying two Americans.
Secretary Lansing said to
day that the inquiry was sim
ilar to that recently made of
the German government re
garding the Sussex.
Washington, April is. fonnt
von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, acting under instruc
tions from his government, will
discuss the submarine crisis in
general terms with Secretary
Lansing at 4 o'clock this after
noon. It was understood. JJiat the am-
bassador has no instructions to
discuss any specific case now in
controversy hteween the two gov
ernments but to take np the sub
ject broadly and to seek the view
point of the Aemrlcan government
in the present situation.
There were some indications today
that Ambassador Gerard has been in
formed by the Berlin foreign office of
its desire to meet the wishes of the
United States if it is shown that the
channel steamer Sussex was destroyed
by a submarine in violation of the
German government's instruction and
that Count Bernstorff was authorized
to make such a statement in general
terms to Secretary Lansing.
Most Exacting F.ver Sent.
The American government's com
munication to Germany designed as
the last word of this government in the
submarine controversy was being put
into diplomatic code today for immed
iate transmission to Berlin. It 13 ex
pected to go forward during the day.
The document is said to be the most
vigorous diplomatic paper President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing ever
have drafted. It covers the activities
of German submarines since the Lusi
tania affair and is intended to force
the question of a speedy settlement of
the submarine issue by making plain
that only an immediate change in Ber
lin's policy can prevent a rupture in
the friendly relations between the two
countries.
The president probably also will see
Chairman Flood of the house foreign
affairs committee before the commun
ication is sent to Berlin. The docu
ment was discussed today by the pres
ident and the cabinet. Secretary Lans
ing and President Wilson conferred
early this morning on the communi
cation. Torpedoed Without Warning.
London, April 18. An announce
ment was issued by the admiralty to
day corroborating the previous un
official statement that the British
steamship Zent, sunk early this month,
was torpedoed without warning. The
statement says she did not see the
submarine and sank in a very few
minutes with a loss of 49 lives.
Regarding the Holland-American
freighter Eemdijk which arrived at
Southampton, April 11, in a damaged
condition as the result of an explos
ion, the admiralty statement says she
was torpedoed by an enemy submarine
on April 7, while on a passage from
Baltimore to Rotterdam. She had the
Dutch colors painted on her sides in
four different places and also tier
name and port of register in large
white letters ou her sides.

SAY ASQUITH
IS UNABLE TO
MEET CRISIS
Prime Minister of England
Delays Speech on Re-
-' cruiting'Questfoflr''
London, April 18. Premier Asqulth
will not make his expected statement
in the house of commons on the re
cruiting question today according to an
official announcement made at 12
Downing street.
The postponement of Premier As
quith's statement on the recruiting
question which he had promised to
make in the house of commons this
afternoon was taken as an indication
that the cabinet ministers were unable
to reach an agreement on this subject
which has brought about the most ser
ious crisis the prime minister has had
to meet In his eight years as head of
the government.
The decision came as a complete
surprise to those not within the inner
circle but it later transpired that ne
gotiations had been in progress dur
ing the night and early morning with
that end in view.
Besides the cabinet meeting there
was a conference of the special com
mittee appointed to make a final et
fort to bring about a solution of the
problem but like the cabinet it was
unable to reach an agreement and a
postponement of the premier's state
rnent became imperative unless an im
mediate breakup of the coalition was
to be faced.
The special committee consisted of
David Lloyd George, Field Marshal
Kitchener, Sir William Robertson, Wal
ter Hume Long, president of the local
government board, and Arthur Hen
derson, president of the board of edu
cation. Premier Asquith is expected to ex
plain in the house of commons the rea-
sons for the postponement of his
statement.
NOTED PAINTER ENDS
LIFE BY TAKING GAS
Chicago, April 18. Despondency Is
believed today to have been the cause
of the self-destruction in a shabby
studio on the north side here of Fran
cis D. Cavallaro, a painter said to
have been noted at one time.
Cavallaro, who was 60 years old, is
reputed to have been honored by Eur
opean royalty and his paintings adorn
many churches and theatres, princi
pally in Europe.
According to newspaper clippings
found in his room, the artist at one
time was the honor guest at a recep
tion in London, headed by the Italian
ambassador, when his portrait of the
king of Italy was unveiled. Growing
age with "lessening of commissions
made hira despondent, and the suicide
of a friend recently Is believed to
have led hira to kill himsetf.

Camp of General J. J. Pershing',
at the front, April 17, by motor
and wireless to Columbus, April
18-The American pursuit of
Villa is at a standstill because of
the unprovoked attack upon
American cavalrymen by the In
subordinate soldiers of the Car
ranza garrison at ParraL At Gen
eral Pershing's headquarters there
seemed no prospect of the re
sumption of the chase while there
were numerous Indications that a
continuation of the pursuit would
meet with armed resistance.
A small party of American offi
cers was fired upon near here last
night, none of the Americans be
ing Injured. This coming on the
heels of other reports of snip
ing is responsible for the belief
that the expeditionary command Is
confronted with a serious prob
lem. A report receded here from
Carranza sonrces that a Villa col
onel, captured near Cnsihniriachio
had promised to lead party to a
grave in wnicn tma was saia to
have been buried last Friday, is
generally discredited by military
authorities here.
San Antonio, Texas, April 18. Ix
Francisco Villa is not dead he has
now an excellent opportunity to es
cape Into territory far beyond the
most advanced of the American de
tachments because the punitive force
has penetrated about as far south as
it is going to go with the present or
ganization. Official admission that It
was impossible to extend the mala
line of communication south of
Satevo was taken today to mean that
the field of operations would be re
stricted to that district over which de- '
tachments of cavalry with provisions
for one or two days could ride. Be
yond the arc of that Villa would
be safe so far as the Americans ara
concerned.
Pershing Explains Situation.
General Pershing is believed to
have explained in detail this phase of
the situation in a report to General
Funston and to have made recom
mendations that more effective facili
ties for the pursuit of Villa be author
ized. The drive of the three cavalry
columns to Parral and its environs
established the fact that there is no
chance of obtaining provisions in that
region and that every force sent for
ward must depend wholly on the quar
termasters with the main column for
supplies. They were reported to
have fallen back to Satevo but wheth
er they have started out again to beat
the trails in the district beyond has
not been told. '
Guard Against Attack.
Officers here regard the Parral In
cident as indicating clearly that
General Pershing's men now have to
guard themselves not only against at
tack by Villa's men but by those de
tachments of Carranza's army that
are antagonistic to his announced at
titude of cooperation.
General Funston sent messages to
day asking that a report be made ta
him at once on the unofficial rumoe
that a train load of forage shipped
from Juarez to Chihuahua and intend
ed for the American troops had been
seized by the Carranza authorities.
The arrival of some of the supplier
sent to Chihuahua has been reported
but no advices that they had reached
the army have been received.
General Funston was awaiting to
day the confirmation of the story that
Villa was dead. No American official
has sent any report other than repeti
tion of the unconfirmed repors from
Mexican officials.
