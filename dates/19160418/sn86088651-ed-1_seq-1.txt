THE NEW
SON
Albert Spaulding, America's Greatest Violinist
More Distinctive
Than a Strad
The fjenius of the great Stradivari did not produce a violin so distinctive from
other violins as Edison's new invention is distinctive from all other sound pro
ducing instruments.
In no other field of scientific, artistic or mechanical endeavor has so distinctive an
achievement been made as by Edison in the development of his new art, by
which all forms of music are literally re-created.- No painting, no jewel, no object
of art, no book or musical composition, no rug or tapestry, no piece of furniture,
no piano, no mo or car-nothing which the human mind can conceive possesses
so great a distinction among similar articles as Edison's new invention has achiev
ed in the field of sound reprodjetion.
We want you to hear this new invention. Come to our store any time and we
will take pleasure in affording you every opportunity- to hear the same high class
Edison selections.
