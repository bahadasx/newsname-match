Large Quantities of Amunition
Has Been Issued to First
Regiment.
by ewTng lewis.
Mercedes, Texas, Aug. 26.—Bis­
marck soldiers were carrying big
chests of ammunition down the sun­
baked company street today. Ammu­
nition has been issued to all the com­
panies of the regiment. With the
movement of regulars and Texas
guards, relieved from patrol work at
many points along the Rio Grande,
and of Nebraska and Indiana guards
who will take their places, the be­
lief that real work awaits them has
filled the hearts of the North Dakot
ans, and they are a cheerful regi­
ment.
Long Stay.
They are also becoming convinced
that they are not on the border for
a month or two of training, but for
a long stay. A number of officers
make arrangements for their families
to join them in Mercedes, to spend
the winter here if the regiment is
stationed in Mercedes that long.
Houses are hard to get. With 11,000
soldiers at Llano Grande, three miles
away, and no habitations there but
tents, shelter in Mercedes is at a.
premium. A Western Union operator,
sent hexe from Dallas, yesterday paid
$25 for a single room for himself and
his witeior a rasmUu Heufr,ad. iiwtted
hi* Dallas' buifealWTiurnished, for
$20 when he was ordered to come
here. Officers are paying similar
rents for rooms. In a number of
cases three or four officers have pool­
ed their money, rented a furnished
house, and sent for their families.
There Is not a vacant house, in re­
pair, to be had in Mercedes.
Making Money.
Nearly everybody in Mercedes, in
cluding the women and children, is
busy making money, and no doubt the
fever will claim a number of North
Dakota families when they arrive. Of
course the Mercedes folk won't let
them in on the ground floor. They
consider the troops from the north
are Providence's gift to them, and
they get up early to fight for their
share of the manna. But there are
money-making opportunities for stran­
gers too. Skillful seamstresses are
in demand. All the big camps have
sweet teeth that are never satisfied.
I know a Mercedes woman who each
Saturday bakes an oven full of white
Icing cakes, each subscribed for by
a hungry officer. If she should ever
fall to do her Saturday baking, I be
lieve they would haul her before a
court martial.
"Kids Busy Too.
It's a question whether the Merce­
des children can be persuaded to go
to school when classes are opened
next month. Almost every youngster
over four years of age is making
money. There are drivers of "two
bitneys" not twelve years old. Boys
tend soda fountains, sell candy, pa­
pers, magazines and Mexican souve
nirs. They collect laundry and dis­
tribute it. I think they would guide
you into Mexico and introduce you
to Villa if you ofTered them money
to do it. Some of the little bootblacks
are making $1.50 a day. Augustine,
a ten-year-old Mexican, tells me he
has saved $40 since the soldiers came.
He makes enough in three days to
pay the rent of the family home for
a month.
The Golden Egg.
With the high school being used as
the North Dakota field hospital, it's
a question whether pupils or patients
Probably the school trustees think
they should get their bite of the gold­
en egg which the American eagle laid
in the lower valley of the Rio Grande.
With a climate like this, I should
think an out-doors school would be
pleasant enough. Latin and history
could be studied under the palms and
the algebra boards planted in the
grass. But, at present, the young­
sters of Mercedes never think of
classes. They are too busy accumu­
lating dimes.
Soldiers throng the little Catholic
church in Mercedes each Sunday
morning. Father Henri Janvier, the
little priest of the mission, radiates
the sunniest good will, the mellowest
happiness. Most of the North Da
kotans who visited his little church
the first Sunday after their arrival
on the border mistook Father Janvier's
dark skin and his accent for Spanish.
He is French, and his kin are fighting
•cross the Atlantic. His sister-in-

Lots of Machinery, But Little
Road Building Being
Done.
COUNTY BOARD CONTINUES
EXTRAVAGANT POLICIES
With but a short period this year
left suitable for road building, the
county commissioners dipped into the
diminishing road and bridge fund yes­
terday by voting to expend $8,000
for more road machinery.
The county will purchase two more
gas tractors, making seven in all for
the five districts. A road leveler and
an overhead grader were also added
to the county's road outfit.
Here is a list of the purchases
made yesterday:
Gasoline tractor, from Aultman
Taylor Co.,
$2,900.
Gasoline tractor, from Minneapolis
S. & M. Co., $3,'faO.
Universal Planer, $1,000.
Elevator Grader (on trial), $1,100.
The Russell Grader company is
putting its grader in on trial and
agree to put a grade over the Mc
Kenzie slough as a demonstration of
the work the machine does.
It has been necessary to transfer
funds from the interest and penalty
account and from the emergency
fund to meet the unusual expendi­
tures. This plan of finance probably
will relieve conditions somewhat, but
the policy 'being followed is not get­
ting results.
William Watson of iMcKenzie ap­
peared 'before the board yesterday
and made a protest against the con­
dition of the east and west road. He
was told that the commissioners
would strive to improve conditions
there.

London, Aug. 6.—tFighting contin-
ues more or less violently on all the
battle fronts in Europe, but no notice­
able successes are chronicled. France
and the region north of Saloniki have
seen the most intense activity and
in 'both fields the initiative generally
has been with the Central Powers.
iParis and London announce the re­
pulse of repeated German attacks on
the Somme and Verdun fronts. Ger­
man efforts were especially strong
at Thiepval, Guillemont, and Maure
pas, north of the Somme, and on the
right bank of the Meuse before Ver­
dun.
London claims an additional Brit­
ish advance near the Mouquet farm.
German trenches on a front of 400
yards along the Courcelette-Thiepval
road were occupied. Berlin asserts
the repulse of attacks along the Som
me front at virtually the same sec­
tors where German successes are re­
ported to have taken place.
Sofiia records the repulse of 18 con­
secutive attacks by Serbian soldiers
northwest of Salonifli. The Serbian
losses are said to have been large.

east of Salonifli, thus pressing in on
the allied troops along the Struma.
No allied advances are reported. Lon­

pected to reach here tomorrow -with
the members of the Borden-Lane Arc­
tic expedition, who were picked up
yesterday at 'St. Matthew Island, in
Berring sea, 25 miles southwest of
Nome, where their new power schoon­
er, Great Bear, was wrecked Aug. 10.
The Great Bear struck on Pinnacle
Rock, a desolate inlet, during a great
storm. Pinnacle Rock is not far from
St Matthew Island and the party
aboard the Great Bear, not only reach­
ed shore safely, but took from the
wreck provisions on which they sub­
sisted fifteen days until found by the
McCulloch.
A report reaching here said the
wreck was an attempt by Captain
Louis Lane, master of the ship, and
joint owner with John Borden, the
Chicago millionaire, to investigate an­
other report that another vessel had
been wrecked in that vicinity.

Hughes today told businessmen of

^igh club that American enterprise
stood face to face with a new era, in
which the watchwords were: co-oper­
ation and efficiency that capital and
labor "are our two hands," both of
which must be used intelligently and
with co-operation in the years to come
to make "American first and Ameri­
can efficient."
Patriotism, the nominee declared,
needed to be directed a little different­
ly in the future than it has been in
the past. A sense of patriotism was
needed in public business, he said.
The businessmen of America, Mr.
Hughes said, were, in his opinion, pat­
riotic, broad, sound in their views and
ambitious. The day of building pri­
vate citadels along the highway of
commerce by which "the ordinary
traveler" could be held up and pay
tribute, he thought, had passed.

Where Is My

Boy Tonight*
The guardians of the peace of Bis­
marck city and Burleigh county for a
half-hour yesterday afternoon had
their hands very full with one tow
haired, blue-eyed young man of three
or thereabouts. The youngster, while
down town shopping became separat­
ed from his mother, strolled down
Fourth street to the Commercial
club clambered up the flight of
stairs to the secretary's office, and
there ensconced himself. When dis­
covered he was seated at the desk,
busily dumping correspondence into
the waste basket and investigating
the contents of various pigeon-holes.
At least three grown-ups endeavored
to learn the young man's identity,
but his vocabulary apparently was
limited to "danny," which was cor­
rectly translated "candy." Several
efforts were made to lure the young
that he might be discovered by some
anxious mother, but he was not to be
diverted. Chief Downing was called
into consultation, and he in turn call­
ed in Sheriff French. At last the
frantic mother was located and a
very indignant young adventurer was
bundled into Sheriff French's big six
and whirled away homeward.
E
MISSOURI IS
BADLY NEEDED
Sentiment for Spanning of Big
Muddy River by Wagon Bridge
Is Growing Warmer.
DISCUSSES SITUATION
Mandan, Aug. 26.—The wagon
bridge across the Missouri is becom­
ing "warmer" daily. This week Man
dan enjoyed a visit from Wilbur J.
Watson, head of the well known Wil­
bur J. Watson Engineering Co. of
Cleveland, O., who in a general way
corroborated the testimony of C. A,
P. Turner, consulting engineer for the
Soo Line, to the effect that a bridge
across the Big Muddy can be realized
for $250,000 to $300,00. Mr. Watson
disagrees with Mr. Turner on only
one important point. The Cleveland
man is just as strong for a suspension
type of bridge as the Minneapolis en­
gineer is for the cantilever style.
While in Mandan, Mr. Watson inter­
viewed President J. H. Newton of the
Mandan Commercial club, W. A. Lan
termann and other prominent citizens,
and he reported a unanimous senti­
ment in favor of the construction of
the proposed bridge at the earliest
possible date. It is Mr. Watson's opin­
ion that outside aid can be procured
if Morton and Burleigh counties pro­
ceed with the bonding proposition pro­
posed. This matter wil be taken up
with North Dakota representatives at
Washington, with the national head­
quarters of the National Highway as­
sociation and with the war depart­
ment.
Favors Toll Proposition.
The Cleveland engineer is in favor
of making: the bridge a toll proposi­
tion. By so doing, he is of the opin­
ion th:jt taxes on the bonds may be
reduced on each side of the river and
that the bridge may ultimately be
made t.o pay for itself. A suspension
bridge, with a 1100-foot span, is, he
contends, entirely feasible for the
Missouri. This would necessitate but
two piers, one at either side of the
stream, as compared with four re­
quired for the cantilever or simple
truss style of bridge. Suspension
bridges are now being built, says Mr.
Watson, which are sufficiently rigid
for any purpose, and in which the
sway is practically eliminated.
Mr. Watson's estimates cover a
bridge with a thirty-foot roadway, al­
lowing ten feet in the center for an
electric railway line eight feet at
either side for wheeled vehicles, and
a four-foot sidewalk for pedestrians.
The bridge floor would consist of
heavy, creosoted planks, and practi­
cally the only repair charges would
consist in the renewal of this, plank­
ing and in the painting of the iron­
work at certain periods. Such a
bridge, properly cared for, will last
indefinitely, the engineer claims. The
theory that steel bridges are not per­
manent has been exploded, he asserts.
Pier* at 150,000 Apiece.
The two piers required for a suspen­
sion bridge carrying a 1100-foot span
would cost not more than $50,000
apiece, Mr. Watson estimates. Prac­
tically no approach-work would be re­
quired at the Bismarck end, and only
a reasonable amount on the Mandan
side. Aside from the approaches, the
structure would cost, the Cleveland
man computes, from $250,000 to $270,-

Suddenly this afternoon when it became known that the rail­
way executives were unanimous in their refusal to accept his

the statement of the railway heads that congress must guarantee

WAS WELL KNOWN
IN MIDDLE WEST
Minneapolis, Aug. 26.—Rev. Thom­
as H. Cleland, D. D., pastor of Knox
Presbyterian church of this city, and
one of the most prominent men in the
Presbyterian church, died today. He
Ti as 73 years old. Recently he was af­
flicted with a stroke of paralysis.
Dr. Cleland and Rev. Sheldon Jack*
son, now of Alaska, were leaders in
the establishment of the Presbyterian
west of the Missouri river, and a mon­
ument bearing their name has been
erected in Sioux City, la.
He was formerly moderator of the
synod of Minnesota, and for the last
six months has been moderator of the
Presbytery of Mineapolis.
Dr. Cleland was born in Mortons
ville, Kty. He is survived by a daugh­
ter, three sons and a sister.
Funeral services will be held Mon­
day and the body will be taken to
Danville, Ky., for burial.
CANNON NEAR DEATH
O. B. Cannon, son of W. E. Can­
non, narrowly escaped death yester­
day, while on his way from Garrison
to Bismarck, when the car which he
was driving turned face and went
over a nearly perpendicular embank­
ment.
The accident happened three miles
north of Baldwin. The rain had left
the road in bad condition and, when
he pilt on the brakes to avoid a col­
lision with a car ahead, his machine
turned and made for the embank­
ment.
It did not turn turtle, however,
standing instead straight up, its nose
buried in mud and water. Cannon
got out of the driver's seat easily and
in a few moments the car was hauled
back on the road.
FIRST SHIPMENT OF GRAIN.

such as previously had been outlined,
will put the next move up to the

will be communicated to them oft*
cially Monday after President Wilson
has heard it from the executives.
Meanwhile, some development of
congressional action is expected and
will depend on the outcome of the
steps between the employers and em­
ployes.
The executives held several meet­
ings during the day, hut no change
resulted in the position they took last
night, when they approved a rough
draft of their reply to President Wil­
son. It was 6:30 tonight when the
committee of eight, which had han­
dled the negotiations, announced that
they had asked for a conference with
President Wilson and awaited his
pleasure. After a two hours' wait the
executives announced that President
Wilson had informed them he would
prefer not to see them tonight.
Counter Proposal.
The situation as summed up late
tonight by those in close touch with
it was this
President Wilson has seen the pub­
lic report of the reply the executives
will make him Monday and does not
wish to accept it. It would not sur
prise those in the confidence of the
railroad officials to have him make a.
counter proposal at that time, retain­
ing his original proposition for an.
eight-hour day, but offering the rail­
roads as compensation congressional
assurances of a freight rate Increase
and a commission to settle future ills*
putes.
Among the executives tonight' it
clearly was evident that such a coun­
ter proposal would be accepted.
Whether they would receive It from
President Wilson and take It unier
consideration for a few days was not
at all certain, but its ultimate rejeo*
tion was forecast generally.
The proposition of the men Is sot
clear. Apparently, they will net ac­

has been published, but they atight
be willing to negotiate with It arf a
basis. They will meet again at It
o'clock tomorrow morning.
Congress Silent.
Nobody knows the attitude ot
gress toward the suggested legisla­
tion. It was pointed out tonight that
there are many senators who bitariytl'
oppose the 5 per cent increase
