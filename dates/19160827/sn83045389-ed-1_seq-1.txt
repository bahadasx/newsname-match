"ENEMY" FLEET
WINS PAR GAME
Mayo Lands Invading Army
After Annihilating Defend
ing Squadron.
ADMIRAL KNIGHT UMPIRE
Dramatic Fight Off Scotland
Lightship, at Entrance to
New York Harbor.
WASHINGTON. August ?T,1?
greatest war game ever undertaken
by the Amcrii-an navy ended to-d.iv
with a victory for Admiral Mayo's
??tori" licet, which, theoretically, wiped
out the defending "l.lue" Ucet and land
ed an inv.iding army at Far Rockaway
r,c;icli, I^ons Inland.
Hcar-'Admiral Knight, acting as um
pire. announced the result in this re
port tr. the Navy Department:
"Maneuver completed. Red and nine
bodies engaged !t:30 to 10:30 this A. M.
ten miles southeast of Ambrose Light
ship. Blue decisively defeated. Red
gaining command of sea. Red effects
landit'g Kai- K" 'kaway and secures
ba s>?."
Tlie final report closely followed one
announcing that Admiral Helm's "blue"
defending feet virtually had been an
nihilated in a dramatic tight off Scot
land Lightship at the entrance to New
York harbor. With the exception of
a f'-w liclit craft, the entire "blue" fleet
was "Mink." The full extent of the
"red" losses was not known to-night, j
although -ally reports showed that
thev inclu ied the sniper-Dreadnought I
Nevada an 1 Texas and two destroyers.
With Aomlral Helm's fleet out of
th? way, only a thin line of submarines
rema'ned to protect the coast. Then
these. toj, were quickly disposed o? by
the "red' fleet, and with nothing left
to interrupt the landing of troops from
his ttansports. Admiral Mayo was de
clared victor In the game, and the
' ships, "red" and "blue" alike, started
for Newport after four days of arduous
I duty at sea.
i IIICI.M COMPLKTEI.Y IM77.I.KI)
IIY TACTICS OK MAYO
j The story of the game, as pieceil to
gether from radio reports to the Navy
Department, indicates that the tactics
I of A'ln iral Mayo completely puzzled
| Admiral Helm, and forced him to ac
1 cept battle in a position from which
there was no hope of escape. The uni
! pire declared the "blue" fleet destroyed
hours before the limit of the action
expired.
When ? the game began. Admiral
Helm's flefet was assembled at Narra
gansett, while Admiral Mayo, with his
fleet and long transport train, were
t'.'iO miles ijff Cnpe iiatteras. At t'i A. M. j
' on August .2, Admiral Helm received
I word of his enemy's location, and his
* seventeen rcouts swept out to sea in a
; lor.g circling line. An hour later, the
"hlue" battleships were also at sea.
! following the scouts.
| The cruiser Baltimore sighted five
battleships, two cruisers and three
other units of the "red" fleet at 6 P. M.
on August 23. They were 500 miles
off the coast, steaming west. The Bal
timore dare.fi not attack such a force.
! and presumably fled for safety.
!t was 11 A. M . August 2">. before
the "rerl" force again was sighted,
i This time it was a battleship which
i was picked up 1 J'1 miles off New York,
j Again the "blue" scout was out
j matched.
j At .r.:30 P. M.. August 2.1. the de
| strover Renham, later reported de
| stroye?l in action, sighted the "red"
transport train seventy miles off the
i New Jersey coast. Relying i?n her
speed to escape the convoying war
? ships, the Renham followed the trans
I ports, keeping Admiral Helm informed.
I At that time the "blue" battle fleet
i was fifteen miles further inshore, stenm
1 ing in a line parallel to the transport
train. At J* 30 the same evening the
( Benham reported that three enemy bat
tleship? and the transport train had
headed inshore to make a landing.
Til IKS TO INTKHCKPT
"KMKMV" AT DAYMUIIT
Admiral Helm drove his battle fleet
forward to intercept the "enemy" at
daylight. He sighted the "red" ships
at 5 o'clock this morning The trans
port train was steaming in toward the
Lone Island coast with Its destroyer
screen thrown out to southward. Dur
ing the night, however, the "red" bat
tle fleet also had come up anil, steam
ing parallel to the transports and be
tween them and the "hlue" fleet, in
? iei |?ti>t'i! itself to cUI i'ff A?!Illil?li 111'lllVrl
j attack
The fleets engaged promptly, but the
, "hlue" position was hopeless To cut
off the rush of the transports for the
coast it had to swing sharply to the
west. As the "blue" ships came to the
J turn they tiled in one at a time and
I caught the concentrated flre of Admiral
! Mayo's guns
While the battle still was in progress
: Admiral Helm played his last card.
! The seventeen submarines, mobilized at
' Block Island the preceding night, wore
following the movements of the "red"
transports, but keeping well inshore
j as a last line of defense. Daylight
j found them within an hour or two of
l the chosen landing point of the in
! vaders. Admiral Helm ordered them
I forward in a desperate effort to de
stroy the troop ships, but they were
not equal to the task, and the trans
| ports and their shielding lighting ships
' steamed by victorious.
