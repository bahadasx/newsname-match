short of miraculous.
The car bus ascending the hill,
and when about halfway to the top at
the steepest point. Mr. Woolery states
he heard something snap, and the car
darted swiftly back down the hill.
Mr. Woolery applied both foot and
emergency brakes, but finding they
failed to hold tried to keep the rapid
ly moving machine In the road. The
speed waa so great, however, that the
machine left the grade and lodged to
the left of the bill, on a pile of rocks,
at the top of an eight foot embank
ment at that point
Mr. Woolery's brother, Lawrence,
seeing the danger of turning over the
bank, probably saved the machine
from overturning by stepping out on
the running board and placing his
weight on the side held the car until
the women could get out.
Then, together, the two men block
ing up the side, removed the machine
from its periloug position, and came
to town for help.
The party this afternoon feel for
tunate that nly a small pile of rocks
saved the car from overturning, and
possibly more serious results.

PHOENIX, Aug. 26. That members

Arizona for Arizona officials even
though they have resided in the state
a year as required by law 1b the rul
ing or Wiley Jones in answer to a
letter addressed him by the secretary

nittee.
Here la Jones' letter:
Phoelnx, Arizona.
Aug 22 1S1C.
Andrew Baumert, Jr., Esq,
Secretary Republican State Central
Committee of Arizona,
Box 478,
Phoenix, Arizona,
Dear Sir: I ,'
I have before mi your Ictte- of
jesterday, wherein you refer 'o vcur
letter of inquiry of the 15th. insL,
asking for Information in rvfer.-..ce
to the national guard and the United
States soldiers, in the matter of eli
gibility to vote.
Most certainly the national guard
of other states or members of the
regular army of the United States,
even though stationed In the state of
Arizona, cannot vote for Arizona of
ficials. Our own national guard of
Arizona can register before any Jus
tice of the peace or notary public in
the county where such voter may be,
under Paragraph 2893, Revised Stat
utes of Arizona, 1913, and his regis
tration papers can then be sent to the
county recorder of his home county for
entry upon the great register.
Having given you the law upon
the subject of our national guard,
and the section under which they can
proceed, you will observe the law has
thus provided for their registration;
but in the matter of the national guard
of other states and of regular soldiers
of the United States army, they have
no right to vote for Arizona officials,
except, however, one who has enlisted
In this state in the regular army
would have the same right that our
own national guard would have as
above designated, in reference to reg
istration and voting.
Very truly yours.

Attorney General.
