Washington, Aug. 26. With dram

fame today in the negotiations to
prevent the threatened railway strike.
A break between the railroad

resenting 111.000,000,000 capital,
seemed certain.
Sixty railroad ' presidents called
here a week ago by President Wilson
have Ignored his peace proposal and
decided to submit a substitute pro
position, which even the most optlm

down.
It provides:
That an eight-hour day. Inasmuch

That the roada will abide by the de

Denver, Aug. 26. One mile above
sea level and the guest of the Mile
High club, Republican Nominee
Hughes today pleaded strongly for a
unified, and co-operating America. Ac
cording to the candidate himself, the
upeech was not Intended to be par
tisan. But he laid emphatto stress
upon the necessity for republloan doc
trines in government handling of Its
business and economic problems,
The , governor was greeted as
"Charley Hughos" by a double octet
of enthuslaitlo Drown alumni when
he entored the dining hall and
throughout the lunoheon the Brown
Inns vociferously sang the songs of
the governor's alma mater, the can

gubernatorial candidate, Julius G.

the work .
The proposition Is less than 400
words long. 'It Is the tW concrete
plan that has been voted on at any
time by the railway beads and met
with unanimous approval.
It Is the only proposal that will
come from the roads, according to
one of tho leading executives today,
and, ho added, "it Is better than the
brotherhood leaders deserve. If they
don't like It, they know what they
can do."
Washington, Aug. 26. "Wo are
ready." ,
This statement came today from
both railroad executives and employes
as a national transportation paralysis
loomed up. Hallroad managers con
tended that they could keep sufficient
trains running through "loyal" em
ployes to prevent a milk and food
famineand Its consequent garner
ing of death and desolation.
The employes said there might be
a few ready t6 continue laboring, but

In (he railroad camp the grimmest
lighters said, "Put white lead on the
engines and lay everything off."
The most conservative said, "We
must see that the babtea have their
milk and the nation its food."
Down the street the employes said
the guilt for ruin or starvation
would lie upon the railroad kings.
It developed today that while the
railroad presidents have been wres
tling with the problem of meeting
President Wilson's proposal, the man
agers, somewhat sidetracked from
the phase of the situation, have been
working out plans for handling an
actual strike If it comes.
A comprehensive plan is complete,
they now declare. It Includes details
of train operatiou. Emergeucy sche
dules have been made and It Is known
that since the beginning of the nego
tiations embargoes on some commo
dities have been considered. One
railroad official said that immediately
upon declaration of a strike embar
goes will be placed on war munitions
and dry goods and non-perishable
commodities not regarded as necessi
ties. '
The first thought of the railroads
will be to carry foodstuffs.

Colorado, and Dr. W. F. Sloouni, pre

Hughes was informed that in 1908
the Mile High club had entertained a
man who had gone back to New Jer
sey to become its governor, and later
the same man was entertained and
went to become president of the
United States.
Hughes remarked that he did not
know whethor It wat a good omen or
not to be president but he was cer
tainly appreciative.'' 'He spoke of the
eagerness with which he had looked
forward to' a stay in Colorado and
rest after the difficult campaigning
trip. ' ' ' '
"I believe there Is a new spirit
abroad In the land," he said. "I
think there are very few butlness men

BATTLE FOUGHT
81 II. S. FLEET
Washington, Aug. 26. A great

New York harbor for six hours.
The' main battle fleet of Admiral
Helm, defending the coast, engaged
the "enemy" fleet of Adiutrsl Mayo
at 6 o'clock off Scotland lightship, at

scout cruiser Birmlnghs and the
destroyers Fanning, Drayton and
Batch.
It la believed here that the "en
emy" tattleshlps were "destroyed"
early in the fight by destroyers.
The sunken ships, under tbe rules
of the game, have to put into Atlantic
ports. Large bodies of theoretically
wounded have been rushed to naval
hospitals and the hospital wards of
both fleets at sea are rapidly filling.
. If the assumption that the enemy
battleships were torpedoed is correct,
naval officers here see gTeat "loss of
life", for those two vessels.- , '
The "enemy" transport train of 30
vessels Is reported to be lying back
of the attacking fleet, waiting for a
chance to allp by the defending lines

German War Chief Comments
and Tells United Press Corresponded Tlst End cf
, Conflict Will Come With the Sdiessess cf aa Acci
dent, Though Germans Are Ccddest cf Victory
By Carl W. Ackerman.
Strausberg, Germany, Aug. 26.
In eight weeks of tremendous effort,
with lavish expenditure of human
flesh and blood and ammunition, the
allies not only have failed to break
the German line on the Somme but
have not even badiy bent it, General
Alexander von Kluck, who command
ed the German right in the great ad
vance to tbe gates of Paris, told the
United Press today.
"In eight weeks of fighting they
have gained a few kilometers at ter
rible losses," said the German war
tn..n ."TkA V .1 I r.L. V -It
ed practically nothing. They have
only exposed themselves to our
counter-attacks, which will certainly
come," T, : '.. -
We were seated in the smoking
room of Wilkendorf castle, near
Strausberg. Before us was a map of
the Somme battle line. General von
Klack first explained the positions
held by' his army when he wss in
command on this front before he was
, wounded.. The territory the allies
are now trying to break through, is
, the. same eround across which; von
j Kluck hurried with his ' armjp during
the first advance into France in the
fall of 1914. After 22 months of
flgiting, the battle line at this front
shows little change, except that the
Germans have been pushed back a
few kllomete.
"The British losses on, the Somme
have been terrible," continued von
Kluck. "They have been much great
er than ours. The English had to
put new men into each attack. Their
losses must exceed ours by at least
100,000."
"Is that many for the large army
England is reported to have?" he was
asked.' . . '
"The decisive thing is always to
have plenty of men" he replied, "but
when there is a great offensive like
this Anglo-French movement and
little progress Is made; when the
losses are great and no progress is
evident, the spirit of the troops weak
ens and that weakens the offensive"
"It is reported abroad that Ger
many is facing a great military crisis
now that the allies are attacking on
several fronts and it is even rumored
that It will not be long before she
will collapse," he was told.
"You can see for yourself that
there is no crisis," the general' laugh
ingly replied. "Eight weeks have
passed since the Anglo-French offen
sive began. The preparations for it
must be called Immense. England
brought armies that might never have
been expected of that country, thanks reptly recently when it laid: 'Europe
to Kitchener's labof and it waslacks courage for peace. " V
ARCTIC EXPLORING SCHOOII
BEAR IS WRECKED III
Sim Francisco, Aug. 26. -The pow
er Bchooner Great Bear, used by the
Borden-lwne expedition in the Arctic,
was wrecked on a rock In the Bering
sea, according to a wireless report
here from 'the coast guard cutter Mc
Culloch, sent lu search of the vessel,
which was ten days overdue at Nome.
, The wreck occurred August 10 dur
ing a gale. The vessel was lost but
the party landed safely at St.
Mathew't lBland, where they were
found by the MoCulloch. ' t
John Borden, of Chicago, and Cap
tain Louis Lane, of this city, organ
izers of the expedition, and Norrls
Bokkuin, navigator, were aboard In
addition to the crew.
Mrs. Charles D. Lane, mother ot
tho explorer, today stated that, know
on Progress cf the War,
Kitchener's labor. France, despite
her serious losses at Verdun, had put
the last reserves of her thirty fight
ing years '(meaning thirty classes) to
gether. The industries of France,
England, the United States and Japan
worked feverishly to supply the allied
armies with tremendous amounts of
war material for 'a general offensive
on all fronts.'
'The moment of tbe attack seemed
well chosen, because Germany, dur
ing the weeks before, was supposed
to be suffering under shortages
caused by the blockade.. Before the
possibility of a splendid harvest be
came known to the allies, they be
came convinced that only a great
military success was needed to bring
the wavering spirit of Germany
wavering, as they supposed to her
knees.
"The battle of the Somme has now
raged for several weeks. Despite a
tremendous use of ammunition, and
repeated stores of human material, ,
the result of the general offensive is
now unimportant when compared to
the great waste of physical and moral
"The German front on the Somme
stands unshaken, despite the tardest..
forward 'and backward fighting, where
the opposing armies are locked In a
struggle like two stags.
"A change has taken place in the
former victorious tone of the French
press of a tew weeks ago. The French .
newspapers now ask their readers to
be patient and not to ask too much.
"On all the fronts of the German
armies and throughout Germany is
the firm belief in victory. , 1
"A United Press dispatch from
Verdun spoke of the moral power of
the German troops. This is the same
on all fronts and It is this spiritual
force, as every historian knows, that
Is the decisive thing that will end the
present struggle." ,
TIiH conversation turned ' toward
Field Marshal French, who was von
Kluck's opponent In the battle of
Mons. I began to make notes of the
general's remarks.
"Please don't write that," he said.
"During the war we must not talk of
our opponents. It is always best to
speakwell, even of your opponents.
but there art many things about the
story of this .wMthat, conclusively
written, ' would constitute a whole
lfbrary."
"How long do you think the'wa-s
will last?" was one question I put to
the general. ' ' ' ;
"It can last years or days," was bis
reply. "The end of the war will come
as suddenly as an accident. A Swiss
