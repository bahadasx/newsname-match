LONDON, August 26.?The
Sofia announcement of today
discloses a wide extension of the
Bulgarian occupation of Greek
territory. The area now taken
over skirts the Aegean for about
fifty miles. Apparently the Bul
garians have seized all northeast
ern Greece from the Bulgarian
border to Orfano. where the old
front ended. They are thus es
tablished over a large section on
the eastern flank of the entente
allies.
Object of Operations.
The Bulgarians began occupation of
this region last week, sending one force
westward across the Mesta river to the
vicinity of Ka'vala, and another south
ward along the Struma river, where
several Greek forts were occupied. In
the light of Sofia's announcement* to
day, It is apparent the Bulgarians have
been continuing this movement, evi
dently with the purpose of anticipating
the entente allies, and organizing for
defense the open country along the
Aegean, which affords the best avenue
of approach for an invasion of Bul
garia from Salonlkl.
Although this move la reported to
have inflamed the Greek, people, it was
made with the assent of the Greek gov
ernment, which has reached an under
anding with Germany and Bulgaria
-a-Tt" occupied terrltoryla-(?
^ Sftiff after the war. '
^Germany Reports Gains.
Further progress for the troops of
central powers northwest of Ostrovo
lake, on the Macedonian front, is re
ported in today's German artny head
quarters statement, which says:
"Northwest of Ostrovo lake some
progress was made in an attack on the
liganska Planina. On the Moglenica
memy attacks were repulsed."
Bulgarian Official Beport.
The Bulgarian statement of today
follows:
?Our offensive on our right wing (on
the western end of the front) con
tinues. In the region of Moglenica
mountain considerable Serbian forces;
of the Schumadie division, supported i
by neighboring troops, from the night j
of August 21 until the afternoon of
August 23, attempted eighteen con
secutive attacks against our advanced
positions in the section of Kurkuruz
and Kovel. All their attacks were re
pulsed. whereupon the Serbians retired
to their former positions. Their losses
were immense.
"Our left wing, advancing upon the
Aeeean coast, met weak British cav
alry detachments, which took flight in
the direction of <"?oge and Orfano, pur
sued by our troops.

Claims Capture of Points.
"August 23 we captured Kreta, j

meters north of Leftera; the village of j
Dranova. three kilometers west of !
Pravishta; the territory to the heights
north of Kavala and the whole Sarisha

"The assertion of the French general
?taff that French troops have occu

was from the beginning in possession
of the French."
British Communication.

| "Stalwart American" Who
Changed Views of Admin
istration "Overnight.
PENTER. August 26.?For the first
time in his campaign Charles E. Hughes
. named Theodore Roosevelt in an ad
! dress. The nominee was speaking at
the Auditorium, here, of preparedness.
He had assailed the administration for
calling advocates of preparedness
"nervous and excited."
"And then," Mr. Hughes said, "a stal
! wart American went through the
land "
I He was Interrupted by a roar from
the crowd. As the applause died down
the nominee continued:
"Mr. Roosevelt went through the
land." he continued, "arousing the na
tion to its need, and the administration
changed its mind overnight."
Audience Cheers Reference.
The audience, which crowded the big
auditorium, with hundreds standing in
the aisles, applauded loudly.
Mr. Hughes in his address outlined
the policy for which he stands.
"I stand for the firm and unflinching
maintenance of the rights of Ameri
can citizens throughout the world," he
said. "That is a vital question.
I ''We should maintain those rights
! about which there is no cavil with the
strongest nations of the world, no mat
I ter which nations they are. American
I rights, understood, upheld, will give
? us peace, prosperity and good will.
"I believe that we, as a nation, should
be prepared for any emergency. That
j is not militarism. You couldn't carry a
! corporal's guard for militarism; you
could carry the whole country for ade
J quate preparedness."
"Co-operation and Efficiency."
Mr. Hughes today also told busi
ness men of Denver at a luncheon at
the Mile High Club that American en
terprise stood face to face with a new
era in which the watchwords were
co-operation and efficiency; that cap
ital and labor "are our two hands," both
of which must be used intelligently and
with co-operation in the years to come
to make "America first and America
efficient."
Patriotism, the nominee declared,
needed to be directed a little differ
ently in the future than it had been
in the past. A sense of patriotism was
needed irt public business, he said.
The United States, as "the greatest
corporation on earth, on its business
side," was entitled "to be as well man
aged as any corporation on earth,"' and
to the full worth of its every dollar
spent in administration.
The business men of America. Mr.
Hughes said, were, in his opinion, pa
triotic, broad, sound in their views
and ambitions. The day of building
private citadels along the highway of
commerce, by which tire ''ordinary^
traveler" could be held up and pay
tribute, he thought, had passed.
A New Consciousness.
There had been, Mr. Hughes said, a
new consciousness of what is due the
public with respect to public rights and
privileges. Because of that he looked
confidently to the future, where other- :
wise he would look with "deep dismay." i
The luncheon was a non-partisan I
gathering. Among those at the guests j
table with Mr. Hughes were Robert W.
Speer. mayor of Denver, a democrat,
and Julius C. Gunter. democratic candi
date for Governor of Colorado.
Brown University alumni were con
, spicuous at several tables. They wel
j corned the nominee with: "Here's to
Charlie Hughes, drink her down," sung
[ to the air of a Brown College son*?, al- i
1 though prohibition is enforced in Colo- i
j rado. Mr. Hughes Joined in singing I
; other Brown College songs.
The lobby of the hotel was crowded f
i with persons who waited throughout
the luncheon to get a glimpse of the!
J nominee on his departure.
j "I do not think there has been in ?
! many years a campaign in which busi-j
Iness men. solicitous for the future of
our country, should feel or have felt!
'so deep an interest," Mr. Hughes said. ?
1 "The difficulties with which we are ;
'dealing are, in the main, economic dif
I Acuities. And these, I think, are ques- j
jtions that pass beyond partisan differ-!
ences.
"We ought to be able In this country ;
to do right, to insist upon what is
right, to prevent abuses, to cut off j
monopolistic practices, to check and
prevent monopolistic discrimination in (
every unjust form, while at the same j
time we have a fine sense of co-opera- !
tion to have the United States go ahead J
and take a worthy place as a nation, |
successful, proud of its achievements
among the nations of the world.
A New Era.
"We face a new era And ther* are
two watchwords of this era?co-opera
tion and efficiency. You can't ever
amount to anything without either.
"We have had a new consciousness
as to what is nue to the public ^with
respect to public rights and privileges.
I think there are few business men
today who think that the great object
of life is to build up a citadel some
where along the highways of commerce
where the ordinary traveler may be
held up and made to pay tribute
?*I regard that day as passed. I be
lieve the business men of the United
States to be patriotic, broad, sound in
their views and ambitions. And be
cause that is so I look into the future
with confidence that it will be met
aright. I should look to the future
with deep dismay did I not feel this.
"We have got to have efficiency, and
we have got to have a greater co-op
eration than ever before And I
regard it as absolutely essential to
our own prosperity in the iuture that ;
we honestly apply the doctrine of a
protective tariff.
Greatest Corporation on Earth. \
"This government, on its business '
side. i? the greatest corporation on
earth This government, on <ts busi
ness si<Te. is entitled to be as well
managed as any corporation on earth.
This government, on its business side,
demands businesslike management,
getting the >vorth of every dollar, get
ting the talent and the service of the
bfst qualiflfled and most expert men
available.
"Patriotism in this country must have
\ little different direction from what it
has had in the past. We have got to have
patriotism in public business which will
come with that sense of co-operation of
which 1 spoke a moment ago.
"Capital and labor are our two hands.
We can't work with one alone. We must
use them both, use them intelligently,
use them well in the years to come to
make America first and America effi
cient."
After the luncheon Mr. Hughes held a
brief reception at the koteL

LONDON, August 26.- Tn the
face of heavy counter attacks and
major offensive efforts on the
part of the Germans, the British
continue to score successes in the
battle of the Somme. The Ger
mans have multiplied their as
saults in the past few days, but
these almost invariably have
been checked, and when not the
allies later have retrieved all
ground temporarily lost.
German troops attempted twice
to enter the British lines in front
of Bethune, north of Arras, and
German artillery shelled points
near Ypres and Arras, says to
night's British war office com
munication. On the Somme
front the Germans bombarded
the Mametz wood and trenches
north of the Delville wood.
Fighting continues in the region
of the Mouquet farm, where, the
British war office announced to
day, 400 yards of German
the Go*?r?e4ett?~
Thiepval road were captured.
British Official Report.
The British statement of tonight reads:
"The enemies' artillery bombarded
MamAz wood about midday today and
our trenches north of the Delville wood
during the afternoon. Around the j
Mouquet farm fighting continued to-j
day. In this area and in the trenches
south of Thiepval we have captured
one German officer and sixty-six men
of other ranks during the last twenty
four hours.
"Two hostile attempts on one of our
saps south of the Bethune-La Bassee
road this morning were driven back by
our rifle fire. The enemy shelled Roclin
court (north of Arras), La Couture and
our trenches east of Zillebeke (east of
Ypres) during the day, and there was
also much trench mortar activity on
both sides near ihe Hohenzollern re
doubt. Yesterday our batteries suc
cessfully engaged many enemy gun
positions, some of which were destroyed
or otherwise damaged.
"Our aircraft attacked many points
of military importance behind the ene
my's lines, dropping about five tons
of bombs. One hostile machine was
brought down and at least one other
was brought down in a damaged con
dition. Two of our machines are
missing."
Germans Meet Repulse.
The British official statement, issued
this afternoon, follows:
"The enemy bombarded our first-line
trenches along the greater portion of
our front south of the Ancre at vari
ous times from 7 o'clock last night
until early this morning.
"Covered by his artillery fire he at
tacked our positions west of Guille
mont between the quarries and the
Montauban-Guillemont road. He did not
rearh our lines at any point, and was
.repulsed with loss.
"Near Mouquet farm we made further
progress, both on the east side of the
farmstead and also southwest, where
we have taken another 400 yards of the
enemy's trenches along the Courcelette
Thiepval road. *
Sector Deemed Important.
"The importance attributed by the
enemy to the Thiepval sector of his lino
Is shown by the great efforts he is
making to recover his lost ground in
the Leipsic salient. Recently he has
been ??fTecting a great concentration of
Kuns in this area to oppose our progress
and support his attack*?.
"I^ast night he delivered an attack
in considerable force on our new
trenches south of Thiepval village. This
attack was made by trdops of the
Prussian guard and was preceded by
a very heavy bombardment, which
commenced at ? p.m. The attack,
launched at about 7:30 o'clock, was
pressed with determination, but every
where was repulsed with heavy loss
19 the enemy, and we maintained all
our positions.
Gallantry Is Lauded.
"The success of our defense is largely
due to the steadiness and determined
gallantry of the Wiltshires and of the
Worcestershire men. who. In spite of
being subjected to very heavy bom
bardment, steadily maintained their
position and repulsed the determined
assault of the enemy.
"Opposite Auchy we exploded two
mines and occupied both the craters.
"There is nothing to report on the
remainder of our front."

ADJOURNMENT PROSPECT
IS NOT NEAR SO BRIGHT
Railroad Situation and "Corrupt
I ' '
Practices" Measure Threaten to
Keep Congress at Work.
Plans for adjournment of Congress
Friday or Saturday of this week were
shaken up by developments at the Sen
ate end of the Capitol yesterday. The
leaders last night were not optimistic
! over the outlook.
In the first place, the possibility of
J Congress being called upon to enact
legislation to aid in settling the rail
: road strike situation, emphasized by a
visit of the President to the Capitol
i and his conference with Senators New
lands and Kern, threatens to add con
| siderably to the delay in adjournment.
Congressional leaders are not anxious
to mix in the strike muddle, but the
democrats realize that a strike at this
time might resujfc. disastrously for the
party when elections are held in No
vember.
In the second place. Senator Owen's
repeated threat to move to take up the
"corrupt practices act" has created the
belief that there is little chance of get
ting away this week. The fact of the
matter is, however, that many demo
cratic senators are as strongly opposed
to taking up this bill as are some of
the republicans.
Should Senator Owen continue to
taunt the republicans with a desire to
'sidestep this measure, it is likely that
lomorrow a motion will be made by
one of the republican senators to take
up the corrupt practices bill imme
diately. without waiting until the reve
nue bill has been disposed of.
It is doubtful, however, that the Senate
will be able to complete consideration of
the revenue bill in time this week to have
it handled by a conference committee of
the two houses and permit adjournment
by Saturday. Little progress was made
In consideration of the bill last week.
Many amendments are to be offered by
Senate democrats as well as republicans.

PRIEST LEAPS TO DEATH.
Had Besigned Pastorate After Being

parishioners are alleged to have at-J

death, from the sixth floor of a hotel
here today.
According to hotel employes the
priest has been acting strangely since
coming to Chicago. Miss Martha Mc

he had committed suicide while brood

CHAFES UNDERWOOD
Scolded by Senator Stone for
Amendments to the
Revenue Bill.
URGED TO CONFORM
TO CAUCUS DECISION
Alabaman Refuses to Recognize
Right of Seatholders to Dictate.
Amendment Voted Down.
A row among Senate democrats, in
which Senators Underwood and Stone
played the leading parts, enlivened the
debate on the revenue bill in the Senate
yesterday afternoon.
Senator Stone, as a member of the
finance committee, undertook to lecture
Senator Underw6od for Insistence upon
amendments to the pending bill, which
has been approved by a democratic
caucus of the Senate. This Senator
Underwood resented hotly.
The fight was started when Senator
Underwood offered an amendment to
reduce from $3,000 to $2,000 in the case
of single persons, and from $4,000 to
$3,000 for married individuals, the ex
emptions under the income tax. Mr.
Underwood contended this would add
$S,000,000 revenue and would stabilise
the measure.
Amendment Voted Down.
The Underwood amendment was
finally voted down by a vote# of 31 to
19, but not until many bitter exchanges
had taken place between democratic
senators.
Chairman Simmons of the finance
committee reminded the Alabama sena
tor that it was a long-standing Senate
practice for senators to stand by the
decisions of their party caucus. Senator
Stone, also a member of the committee,
declared Senator Underwood deserved
censure for nis attitude toward the bill.
"Is the Senate degenerated to a point
where the individual senators must
take orders from those who serve on
committees because their constituents
kept them in the Senate for many
years?" retorted Senator Underwood.
Refuses Dictation. x
"I do not recognize the right of any
member to di<ytate to me. If that be
treason, make the most of it. No man
can question my loyalty to the democratic
party in victory or defeat."
The amendment received the support of
only five democratic senators. They
were Senators Bankhead, Hardwick, Lane,
O'Gorman and Underwood.
In his denunciation of Senator Under
wood Senator Stone coupled the exemp
tion amendment wffhThe' Alabama sena
tor's declaration that the proposed dye
stuffs tariff is Undemocratic. The sena
tor's attitude toward the bill, he said,
savored of "heroics."
Senator Underwood replied to that" by
saying if his conduct in the matter was
to be accepted as a proper basis of party
criticism of him he was willing hereafter
to stand alone.
Underwood -Answers Back.
"You dare to lecture me," said the
former House leader, "because I dare
to repudiate a part of your bill that is
a stench in the nostrils of the demo
cratic party. I approve of the finance
committee's legislation on this bill in
the main, but I know no reason why
the finance committee should see fit
to arrogate to itself the right to dic
tate to others."
Mr. Underwood said it was conceded
that no binding resolution had been
adopted by the caucus on the bill and
that if there had been one and he had
agreed to it he would stand by it and
"bow his neck." He had bowed un
willingly recently, he said, to a binding
caucus on the immigration bill. The
revenue bill, he declared, had been
"concocted by certain gentlemen in the
Senate trying to dictate to this side of
the House what i? shall do."
Senator Williams, in charge of the
income tax section of the bill, opposed
the Underwood amendment. Senators
Oliver, O'Gorman and Thomas spoke in
favor of it.

Unexpected Trip to Capitol Is
Made in Hope of Breaking
Railroad Deadlock.
WOULD GIVE ASSURANCES
TO SATISFY ROADS' HEADS
Corporation Presidents Await Call to
White House. But Are Forced
to Postpone Statement.
LEGISLATION MOVE DELAYS
Neither Party to Controversy la Ex
pected to Take Any Action
m Until Meetings Are Held
Today and Tomorrow.
The railroad controversy still
remains unsettled.
The situation is still very crit
ical. but decisive action?such as
declaring a strike?is not im
minent. The chances are strong
that there will be no drastic
measures, at the earliest, until
after noon tomorrow.
Both parties to the controversy
have postponed action, the
brotherhoods until their meeting
at 10 o'clock this morning and
the railroad chiefs until after 12
o'clock tomorrow.
Desired to Save Time.
A dramatic element was given to ths
situation yesterday afternoon, when af
fairs were in a tense state, by Presi
dent Wilson making an entirely unex
pected trip to the Capitol to consult
with Senate leaders. It was said by
officials close to the President that hs
made this trip himself, rather than
send for the senators he wanted to see.
to save time, as he believe^ he would be
called upon almost Immediately to (It*
an assurance regarding some phases of
the controversy and outgrowing de
mands of the railroads. ~
The fact that the railroad presidents
were not asked to the White House last
night, although they had notified the
President that they were ready to pre
sent their statement, was believed to be
because the President wanted to think
overnight on what he might say te
them. Many believed he was not satis
fied after his visit to the Capitol that
he could give any assurance that would
satisfy the railroad executives.
Wait Until 9 O'Clock.
The counter proposition of the rail
road presidents, drafted as a reply to
President Wilson's proposal, has not
yet been delivered at the White House.
After waiting from shortly after noon
yesterday until 9 o'clock last night for
an invitation to visit the White House,
the railroad executives were notified
that the President would prefer not to
see them until Monday, and they ad
journed until 12 o'clock tomorrow.
Notice was given with authority from
them that as far as they were con
cerned there would be no action or
statement until after that hour, when
they would reconvene.
Many of the sixty presidents hers
and their managers' committee of
nineteen left Washington in their spe
cial cars last night to spend Sunday in
New York. Atlantic City. Norfolk or
some other seaside resorts. These offi
cials will return here tomorrow morn
ing.
Adjourn Until Morning.
The brotherhood leaders and the com
mittee of 640 general chairmen, after re
maining in session all yesterday after
noon. expecting some word from the
White House regarding conclusions in this
controversy, adjourned until 10 o'clock
this morning.
The men are impatient and have no
tified President Wilson that they believe
the railroad officials are trifling with
them and purposely delaying, but it was
said by several brotherhood leaders that
they would wait patiently over Sunday for
definite word from the President. More
than 100 brotherhood leaders left for.their
homes last evening.
The next move is expected to come
from the railway executives, and it has
been unofficially disclosed that it will
be a refusal to accept President Wil
son's plan as it stands. The execu
tives' counter proposal will carry the
next step to the doors of the employes
and meanwhile the plan of legislative
action probably will be considered by
both sides.
Both Sides Stand Firm.
. In no sense could it be fairly stated
] that a strike was imminent last night.
: although the negotiations were in a
' perilous state which easily might lead
; to one on short notice. The men ap
peared as firm as ever for the unqual
ified acceptance of the eight-hour basio
day. The railway executives appeared
as unyielding as ever in their insist
ence for arbitration.
Two great forces, apparently immov
able, were confronting each other, and
it appeared that only the injection of
some hoped-for new element would
avert a clash.
Nobody knows the attitude of Con
gress toward the suggested legislation.
It was pointed out tonight that there
are many senators who bitterly op
posed the 5 per cent increase recently
granted the eastern roads and criti
cised the commission for its position
in the case, and* who might be expected
to oppose any proposal that would di
rect the commission to grant another
increase.
President's Visit to Capitol.
The threatened railway strike seem
ed so near late yesterday afternoon
that President Wilson personally want
to the Capitol and communicated to
administration leaders the demand of
the railroad executive* that Coagrsaa
ahsould guarantee them some war of
Increasing- revenues If they are to meet
the demands of the employes.
The President told them the railroad
executives had "put it up to ftlm." It
