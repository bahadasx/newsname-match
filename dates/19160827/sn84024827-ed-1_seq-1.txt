Underwood, author of the present tar

of the House, has taken a pi'jminent

legislation. Chairman Simm'ms, of
the finance committee, reminded the
Alabama senator that it was a long
standing Senate pacrtice for senators
to stand by the decision of their party
caucus and Senator Stone, also a
member of the committee, declared
Senator Underwood deserved censure
for his attitude toward the bill.
"Is the Senate degenerated to a
point where the individual senators
must take orders from those who
serve on committees because their
constituents have kept them In the

Senator Underwood. "I do not re

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 26 The
greatest war game ever undertak

today with a victory for Admiral
Mayo's "red" fleet, which theoreti
cally wiped out the defending
"blue" fleet and landed an invad

'the wav. the thin line of submarines
remained to protect .Tie coast. Then
tliese, too. were quiCKiy disposed oi
ov the "red" fleet, and with no foes
left to interrupt the landing of troops
from his transports. Admiral Mayo
was declared victor in the game and
the ships of the "red" and "blue"
alike, utarted for Newport after four
days' arduous duty at sea.
The story of the game, as pieced to
gether from radio reports to the Navy
Department, indicates that the tactics
of Admiral Mayo, completely puzzled
Admiral Helm and forced him to ac
cept battle today in a position from
which there was no hope of escape.
The umpire declared the "blue" fleet
destroyed hours before the time limit
of the action expired.
Mhen the game began Admiral
Helm's fleet was assembled at Narra
ganset, while Admiral Mayo with his
fleet and long transport train were
six hundred miles off Cape Hatteras.
At 6 p. m. on August 22, Admiral Helm
received word of his enemy's location
and his seventeen scouts swept out
to sea in a long circling line. An hour
later the "blue" battleships also were
at sea following the scouts.
The cruiser Baltimore sighted five
battleships, two cruisers and three
other ships at 6 p. m., August 23. They
were 500 miles off ttve coast, steaming
west. The Baltimore dared not attack
such a force and presumably fled for
safety.
It was 11 a. m., August 2f. before
the "red" force again was sighted.
This time it was a battleship which
was picked up 120 miles off New
ork. again the "blue" scout was out
matched. At 5:30 p. m.. August 25, the de
stroyer Benham, later reported de
stroyed in action, sighted the "red"
transport train 75 miles off the New
Jersey coast. Relying on her speed to
escape the convoying warships, the
Benham followed the transport, keep
ing Admiral Helm informed. At that
time the "blue" battle fleet was fifteen
miles further in shore, steaming in a
line parallel to the transport train.
At X:30 the same evening the Benham
reported that three enemy battleships
and the transport train had headed in
shore to make a landing.
Admiral Helm drove his battle fleet
forward to intercept the "enemy" at

WASHINGTON. Aug. 26. The threatened railway strike took on such a
grave aspec tonight that President Wilson turned tqward Congress for a sulu-
' tion of the problem. Suddenly, this afternoon. w.hen it became l:nown tiiat

settlement. President Wilson personally

How this should be arcomiltUed,
j Immediately afterward. Senators began discussing proposals to have Con
gress recora itseii in iavor or a rate increase.
No arrangements were made today for the President to address Con
gress on the subject, but it was considered likely that he might do so durin
the coming week if the situation continued critical.
Tonight t-'ie railway executives finished framing their answer to Presi
dent Wilson's plan and notified the White House they were ready. President
Wilson sent word he would prefer to see them Monday morning at lw o'clock.
The Brotherhood leaders after being tn meeting most of the day ad
journed to 10 o'clock tomorrow morinng. Many of them left town tonight.
The refusal of the railway executives to accept the president's plan, in
cluding concession of the eight hour day. and proposing a counter plan sm ti
as previously .Mas been outlined, will put the next move up to the Hrother
hood leaders. It probably will be communicated to the men ofhciall .Mon
day after President Wilson has met the executives. Meanwhile some de
velopment is expected, and all will depend on the outcome of the next sieps
between the employers and employes.
The executives held several meet-
ings during the day but no change re-
suited in the position they took last
night, when they approved a rough
draft of their reply to President Wil-
son. It was at 6:30 o'clock tonight
when the committee of eignt. which

Among the executives tonight, it
clearly was evident that such a coun-
t?r proposal probably would not be
. accepted. Whether they would re

take it under consideration for a few
days was not at all certain, but Its

Nobody knows the attitude of con
gress towards the suegestei legisla

there are many senators who bi'terly,

criticized the commission for its po

The executives reply lll be divid
ed into argu nent and st;?te:!'.er.t of
their position. Their statement wiil
show that they do not accept th
eight hour day with pay for ten
hours as demanded by the men: that
they maintain this demand really is
cne for an increase in wages; and
that a question of a wane increase is
a matter of arbitration and for settle

Three things are cited by the execu
tives to back up their position. The
first is thar many of the bi shippers
of the country have declared thet-.i
selves oi pos. d to abandonment of

conviction ti.i't to give in to the n;en.

is that no mailer what assurances
are given they feel they cannot ex
pect a rate increase. This feeling Is
explained with statements that the
roads have not forgotten the way they
were attacked when the five percent
case was up. and that they do not
care to lose the position which they
feel they have gained with the public
by risking another attempt.
The attitude of the executives to
night was In marked contrast to that
of a few days ago. Apparently differ
