The committee appointed at a
meeting: held at Vernon, Ala., on
August 14 to settle the dispute con
cerning the route of the proposed
Jackson Highway through Lamar
county, on last Friday submitted to
the board of revenue of that county
a report favoring the northern
route, and the report was accepted
, by the board, which will arrange to
resume work on the thoroughfare at
the earliest possible moment.
' The committee consisted of R. D.
Windham, Hill Strickland, of Mill
port ;L. V. Hinson, R. J. Young, of
Sulligent, and C. F. Burnett, of
Guinn. These gentlemen, none of
whom resides on any of the routes in
dispute, went carefully over all
three of the proposed courses, and
after having given the matter the
most careful consideration decided
upon the northern roufe as the one
the most practicable.
The route crosses the line dividing
the states of Mississippi and Ala
bama at a point 1 1-4 miles north of
where the original route crossed the
state line, and is considered in every
way superior to the course first
mapped out.

MILITIAMAN RUINED HER
LIFE.
Macon, Ga., Aug. 26. Capt. Ed
gar F. Spratling, of Company F.,
Fifth Regiment, national guard of
Georgia, was shot and killed in his
tent' at the state mobilization camp
near here yesterday by Mrs. C. II.
Adams, an Atlanta woman who, ac
cording to the officers at the camp,
accused the guardsman of having
acted wrongfully towards her.
At the Bibb county jail where she
was held under a charge of murder,
pending the holding of a coroner's
inquests, Mrs. Adams asserted in
the presence of county officials that
Capt. Spratling, who in private life
was a physician, had caused her to
shoot him by attentions paid to her
while she was in his office at Atlanta
for treatment before the Georgia
troops were mobilized.
Mrs. Adams, a woman of about 30
years of age, came from her home in
Atlanta and going to the state camp
inquired the way to Capt. Spratling's
tent. Reaching the tent she asked the
c-licer, according to other officers, if
he was Captain Spratling. On being
answered to the affirmative, she fir
ed twice from a small calibre pistol,
both shots taking effect.
The woman, according to Lieut.
Samuel A. Keyser, of Company F.,
who seized her a moment later, cried
out as she shot the officer: "You have
ruined my life."
After the shooting she seemed
hysterical, the lieutenant said, and
begged to be taken from the camp.
She said afterwards that she had
never before seen Capt. Spratling in
his uniform, but that he had treated
her at his omce at Atlanta for a
nervous trouble. Referring again to
the shooting, she declared: "I decid
ed there was but one thing for me to
-do, and I did it. When the testimony
comes out I feel sure the public will
be with me. I am confident I will go
free."

ROBBER SECURES
BUT LITTLE BOOTY
Police Have Little Hope
Establishing Identity
Marauder.
of
of
The residence of Mr. J. R. Rich
ards, No. 317 North Seventh street,
was broken into and robbed some
time Thursday afternoon, the thief
having gained entrance by forcing
the lock on the window. Mr. and
Mrs. Richards are spending the sum
mer in Asheville, N. C, and the rob
bery was discovered by an aged ne
gress who goes to their home each
evening to water the flowers. The
police were notified, and Officers
Glover and Cook, who made an inves
tigation, found that the house had
been thoroughly ransacked. Drawers
were pulled out from bureaus and
wardrobes and portions of their con
tents lay scattered upon the floor;
but owing to the absence of Mr. and
Mrs. Richards, the officers have no
means of ascertaining what was tak
en from the house.
This is the second house ,in the
same block that has been robbed
within the past few weeks and the
police believe that both were com
mitted by some person who is thor
oughly familiar with the neighbor
hood, as the occupants of both houses
were absent from the city when the
robberies took place.
Two other residences were en
tered Friday afternoon, the victims
having been Messrs. M. Krone and L.
B. Divelbiss. Mr. Krone resides at
KOf316 North Gth strevt, M'hi'.e ..Mv.
and entrance to both houses was
gained through rear windows, the
occupants having been absent at the
time. A few dollars were taken from
the Divelbiss place, but, so far as
could be learned, the thief left the
Krone home empty-handed.
Officers GJover and Cook, who in
vestigated the robbery at the Rich
ards home, submitted a report to
Captain J. A. Hudson, who, in the
absence of Chief of Police J. A.
Morton, who was taking his vacation,
was acting as chief, and the Krone
and Divelbiss robberies were also
reported to the same official. Chief
Morton returned to his duty yester
day, however, and immediately took
charge of the cases. An investigation
is being made, but the police enter
tain little hope of apprehending the
thief, as they have no clew to his
identity.

French artists, philosophers and lit
erary men contributed. One said:
The beard of a trooper weighs on
an average of (U grams. With two
million men at the front this brings
the aggregate weight 'to 120 tons. It
was natural that the staff should
think of relieving the army of this
useless weight."

COTTON CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY
GROWN DESPITE HE WEEVIL
FOX AND LLOYD OUTLINE SYS.
TEM IN SPEECHES AT
STARKVILLE.
Starkville, Miss., Aug. 26. In his
second lecture here this summer on
growing cotton under boll weevil
conditions, Prof. J. W. Cox, former
director of the Mississippi Experi
ment Stations, outlined a system of
cotton raising that will work in spite
of the weevils. He spoke for some
time at a farmers' institute and a
round table discussion for the farm
ers of the delta and of North Cen
tral Mississippi, who arrived yester-
day on the farmers' excursion trains
for a two-day short course in agri
culture. Before introducing Mr. Fox, Direc
tor E. R. Lloyd, of the extension de
partment, who led the discussions,
reviewed the agricultural conditions
in Mississippi for the past five years
and told of the improvements that
have been made. He stated that with
in that time the improvement in the
methods of cultivation of crops has
been wonderful. The director pointed
out the advantages of keeping a
few brood sows on every farm and
advised raising two litters of pigs ev
ery year. He said that he hoped to
see the time when every farmer with
200 acres of land will sell a carload
of baby beef or good steers every
year. Turning then to the subject of
dairying, he showed that with good
cows, good pastures and plenty of
feed it was one of the' most profit
able of all farm enterprises. Prof.
Lloyd warned the farmers against
starting creameries before milk from
at least 600 cows was available. In
closing he particularly urged the
farmers not to be led off by
faj
crops, such as ginseng and broom
corn, as substitutes for cotton, say
ing that such crops could only be
profitable when frown, cured and
. marketed by experts, and pointed out
' that such staple crops as oats were
splendid cash crops.
-
That cotton is still the crop closest
to the hearts and pocketbooks of
Mississippi farmers was indicated by
the intense interest with which the
lecture of Prof. Fox was received and
the many questions which followed.
Prof. Fox based his talk on his ex-
periences of the past five years, dur-
ing which time he has grown cotton !
on a large scale in spite of the weevil. I
The three main factors in reduc-j
ing the number of the boll weevil i
that attack the cotton are severe
winters, with a temperature of
around ten degrees above lero, very
of from 97 to 100 degrees being suf
ficient to cook the grub in the
squares, and absence of big timber,
hollow trees and rotting logs, which
furnish favorable hibernating places.
The pest does not live over the win
ter in cotton stalks, ditch banks or
brush piles, as such places do not
offer sufficient protection. The first
task of the farmer is to get rid of
the big timber wherever this is prac
ticable. The next step is good farm
ing. In this connection Prof Fox
stated that the lands must be im
nrov,l. Ilia hohhv in constructive
farming is cowpeas and he urged
v.v fBr t rro m... in .11 f

speaker then outlined the steps ne

to beat the boll weevil, as follows:

UED FOR SERVIANS
RUSSIANS CLAIM TO HAVE IN
FLICTED SEVERE DEFEAT
UPON TURKS.
London, Aug. 26. Apparently,
from the French statement, the al
lied troops do not plan an advance on
the right wing of the Saloniki front,
as British cavalry detachments arc
reported to have destroyed bridges
over the Angiesta river. On the left
wing Paris reports "appreciable"
progress for the Servians and the
capture of several hundred prioners.
In the center, where the main effort
of the allies is expected, heavy ar-
tillery action is taking place, but
there is no report of infantry opera
lions.
The lull on tie eastern front con
tinues but the renewed ofensive by
the Grand Duke Nicholas in Armenia
is growing in extent.
"he recent fighting in the region
of Lake Van is described in Petro
grad as a crushing blow to the Turl.1
and Russian military critics predict
the resumption of the Grand Duke's
aavance toward Asia Minor.
The usual period of comparative
inactivity has followed the western
front gains reported by Paris and
London, and partially confirmed hy
Berlin. The Germans have, however,
attempted a new blow at the French
at the point of the famous St. Mi
hiel salient. This salient juts far into
the French line southeast of Verdun,
and has been the scene of some of
the bloodiest fighting in France.

NO SETTLEMENT
OF STRIKE NEAR
Magnates Desire Arbitration
While Employes Object to
Plan.
Washington, Aug. 26. After the
rtsd.s of the four great ra.lroaJ
bictherhoods threatening a nation
wide strike had gone to the White
House with a warning that their men
would not wait longer than Saturday
night for a reply from the railroad
executives to President Wilson's sug
gestion that an eight hour day
be granted, the executives have
agreed upon a counter proposal to
be submitted to the President. This
plan, holding to the demand for arbi
tiation which the employes declare
they unalterably oppose, proposes:
The the question of an eight-hour
t'ay is not directly connected with
the matter at issue and that there is
a difference between an actual eight
hour day and an eight-hour day as a
basis for pay.
That questions of increased wages
are indisputably questions which
should be settled by arbitration.
That the present demands of tho
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion or some board to be created by
the President or in some other way.
That if the arbitrating board find
a wage increase should be granted
their findings will be retroacting and
the increase will take effect from the
t.me the arbitration begins.
Ihnl a fund shall be created by
he isilroads to provide for this con--
Commission to keep the accounts
that will be necessary, and the ar
rangement to continue in force for a
time not yet determined uport, the
men agreeing that during the period
of arbitration there shall be no fur
ther demands nor any attemps to
strike.
A draft of this report was submit
ted by the committee of eight presi
dents who have been constantly at
work upon its various phases for a
week. There was some discussion, but
only one vote was taken and by it
the sixty presidents and managers
approved the draft. Some slight addi
tions to the phraseology are to be
made and the final draft presented
at another meeting. From that meet
ing the report is expected to be taken
to President Wilson. It has been
stated that this will be the final re
port of the executives.
"It puts the issue squarely up to
tie men," was the way one official
phrase! it.
The crisis in the situation Is ex
pected after the meeting of the Pres
ident and the brotherhood leaders.
