WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. "Every
railroad president now in Washington
believes a strike is inevitable and they
are going to prepare for it." was the
statement given out tonight by an au
thorized spokesman for the railroad
heads, while a committee of the ex
ecutives waited for a call from Wilson
to receive them.
y t'nlted Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2C "We are
ready." This statement came this
afternoon from both railroads and
their employes, as the national trans
portation paralysis loomed larger.
The railroad management contend
ed that they could keep sufficient
trains running through loyal em
ployes, thus preventing a milk and
food famine and consequently guard
ing against death and desolation.
The employes claimed that the
roads would be tied up tighter than a
drum, though a few men might work.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. Washing
ton stood tense tonight in the face
of what appeared to be an inevitable
break between the railroads of the
country and the railroad employes
and a resultant paralysis of business.
Throughout the day executives met,
recessed, met again and again de
layedeach adjournment putting off
until a later hour the transmission of
the first and final proposition to the
President for peaceful adjustment.
Employes met three times, each time
adjourning and finally putting off un
til 10 o'clock tomorrow morning any
further consideration of the prob
lem. President Wilson, who waited most
of the day for the proposal of the
railroads, went to the capital on a
sudden and mysterious visit. He con
ferred with Senator Newlands, chair
man of the interstate commerce com
mittee, and Senator Kern relative to
legislation the nature of which was
not disclosed.
Finally when the railroad execu
tives decided at 3 o'clock to recess un
til S to 10 tonight before acting on
their proposal, it appeared as though
the crisis would swing into another
week.
Railroad executives apparently re
signed themselves to the belief that
the strike is inevitable. Their propo
sition ignores the President's proposal
for an amicable settlement, which was
accepted by the employes. It stands
pat for the arbitration of all matters
pending dispute and it passes the
problem directly back to President
Wilson and the employes. Only some
new suggestion offered by the execu
tives or tremendous concession on the
part of the employes appeared tonight
as possible barriers to stem the dis
astrous trend of the negotiations.
President Wilson on his trip to the
capital presumably sought to learn
what legislation could be affected that
might improve the outlook, but his
visit only served to increase the tens
ion and the determination of the rail
road heads. They declared that they
wanted no legislation, no promises of
increased rates. They want and will
stand out for arbitration nothing
else they say.
Senators Newlands and Kern were
called into conference with President
Wilson at the White House shortly
after S:30 tonight. Soon after they
had reached the White House it was
said that the railroad presidents who morning in the Katy yards. The train
were to have seen the president at : men did not know that the derail was

night. President Holden of the Burlington
at 7 o'clock issued the following state
ment: "The presidents conference
having concluded their discussion, the
committee of eight have asked for an
appointment with the President and;
arc awaiting his pleasure."
Asked if he shared the belief that
a strike is certain. A. B. Garretson,
the employes spokesman, said: "It
all depends on what President Wilson
is able to do."

The committees arc all hard at
j work sai(, chairman Conley. yester-
day morning, "and are waiting to
bring the tickets in until they can
report large sales. Competition is
becoming very great among the work
ers, and we arc confident that there
will be 1,300 sold before the show
starts on Monday night. At the last
report, over 800 were sold, and there
has been a great number bought at
the box-office, so the number has
reached at least 1,000."
Schwabe, Rollins, and McPheetcrs
have a total of 114, with 29 sold yes
terday. This insures them a lead, but
the team of Evans, Jacks, and McIIarg
arc a close second with 101 total.
The leading team deserves much
credit. Mr. Rollins provided the car,
and the committee has called upon
the Westwood section of the city, and
made a canvass of the rcsidnece dis
trict. S. F. Conley is still in the lead for
individual work, but he has been
