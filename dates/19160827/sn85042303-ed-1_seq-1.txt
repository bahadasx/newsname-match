worked steadily all morning,
and the forepart of the after

concessions by the railroads of
the eight-hour day or action of
congress by taking over the
railroads for government oper

That the exhibits at the county

dicated by enquiries now reaching

of the county in which men want to
know exactly when they shall bring

"At the recent meeting of the State
Federation of Labor at Tulsa, Ard
inore was suggested as the place for
holding the next annual meeting, but
Ardmore did not succeed for two rea
sons. Firn(, there U not an adequate
hall In the city where a convention
of thin .size ecu Id be held; and sec
ondly, the hotel accommodations in
this city have been notorious through
out the state, and large conventions
are not likely to bo held In cities
where tlietti; two most essential fea
tures are lacking.
Plans are well under way for both
a hotel and convention hall, but until
both are erected It is Idle to dream
thnt Ardmore will be able to secure
conventions of any sort. Several
could have been held here the past
year had the neressary accommoda
tions been available, but were taken
to other cities that possess the very
things that Ardmore lacks."

essentials at present to attract con

even now making Investigations in
Missouri and Kansas, and will report
on their findings this week.
The funds are available for the.
