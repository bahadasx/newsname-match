MAY ADDRESS^CONGRESS
Senators Begin to Discuss Proposals
to Have Congress
Favor a Rate Increase.
(BY ABBOCI.TID PRESS)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 26.?The
threatened railway strike took on .
such a grave aspect today that I'resl- j
dent Wilson turned toward Congress
for a solution of the problem.
Suddenly this afternoon when it
became known that the railway ox- j
ecutives were unanimous in their re- J
fusal to accept his plan of settlement, I
President Wilson personally went to ;
the capltol and laid before Majority 1
J.eader Kern of the Senate and Sena- [
tor Newlands, chairman of the inter-,
state commerce committee, tho state- I
Inient of the railway heads that Congress
must guarantee some source
Df added revenue, If they are to meet
the demands of their employes.
May Address Congress.
How this should he accomplished j
President Wilson did not suggest. |
Immediately afterward senators be- j
gan discussing proposals to have
Congress record ilself in favor of
rate Increases. No arrangements
were made today for the president to [
address Congress on the subject but j
It was considered likely that he might
do so during the coming week, If the ,
situation continued critical.
Tonight the railway executives |
finished framing their answer In
President Wilson's plan and notified
the White House they were ready.
President Wilson sent word he |
would prefer to see them Monday
morning at 10 o'clock.
The brotherhood leaders after ho- .
ing In meeting most of the day adjourned
to 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning. Many of them left town.
Wext Move Is Brotherhoods.
The refusal of the railway e.wutives
to accept the p.esident's plan
Including concession of the eighthour
day, and proposing a counter
plan such as previously been outlined,
will put the next move up to the
brotherhood leaders. It probably
will be communicated to them ofllcially
Monday after Presid<mt Wilson
hns heard from the eximutlves.
Meanwhile some developments of
possible congressional action is ex-1
pected and will depend on the out-1
come or trie next steps Dciween employes
and employers.
The executives held several meeting
during the day but no change
resulted In the position they took last
night, when they approved a rough
draft of their reply to President Wilson.
It was 6:30 tonight when the
committee of eight, which has
handled the negotiations, announced ^
that they had asked for a confer-;
ence with President Wilson and!
awaited his pleasure. After a two
hours' wait the executive announced!
that President Wilson had Informed j
