WILSON TURNS
TO CONGRESS
IN RAIL CRISIS
Must Guarantee Roads
Some Source of Kevciiue

HEADS WILL OFFER
PLAN ON MONDAY
Refusal to Accept Presi
dent's Plan Leaves Move
to Drotherhoods.
WASHINGTON. Auk. 26. The
threatened ritllw.iy strike tool
on such a- grave aspect today that
President Wilson turned towurd con
gress for a solution of the problem.
Suddenly this afternoon, whim It
became known that the railway ex
ecutives w?re unanimous In their le
fiFl to accept his plan of settlement.
President Wilson personally went to
the capital and laid before Majority
Leader Kern of the senate and Sen
ator New-lands, chairman of the in
terstate commerce committee, tho
statenienl of the railway heads that
eongrors mUHt guarantee si me source
of added revenue If they are tn meet
the demand" of their employes-.
How this should be accomplished
President Wilson did not sugg st. Im
mediately afterward senators i) (f in
dirousslon of proposals to have coii
gresx record itself in favor of a r.Ue
Increase
No arrangements were made today
for the president to address congress
on the subject, but it was ooiista
ered likely that ho might do so dur
ing the coming week if the situation
continued critical.
Tonight the railway executives
finished framing their amwer to
President Wilson's plan nnd notified
the White House they were ready.
President Wilson sent wold he would
prefer to see thorn Monday morning
at 10 e'l-lock.
M-et This Morning.
The l.riiVTiefhoodl leaders, afler be
ing In meeting most of the day, ad
journed to 10 o'clock tomorrow morn.
Ing. Minji of ihcm left town to
night. The refusal of the railway execti
lives to accept the president's plan
Including concession of the right
hour day and proposing a counter
plan -ucii as previously has been out
lined, will nut the next move up t"
the brotherhood lender It prob
ably will he communicated to them
officially Monday after President
Wl!on has heard It from the execu
tives. Meanwhile some development of
possible congressional action Is ex
pected and will depend on the out
come of the next steps between the
employers and employe
The executives held several meet
ings during the day, but no change
resulted In the position they took
last night when they approved a
rough draft of their reply to Pres
ident Wilson. It was 6:30 tonight
when the committee of eight which
has handled the negotiations an
nounced that they had asked for a
conference with President Wilson
and awaited hla pleasure. After a
two hours wait the executives an
nounced that President Wilson had
Informed them he would prefer not
to see them tonight.
The situation as summed up lato
tonight by those in close touch with
It was this:
"President Wilson has seen the
published reports of the reply the
executives will make hlin Monday
and does not wish to accept it. It
would not surprise those in the con
fidence of the railroad officials to
have him make a counter-proposal
at that time, retaining his original
proposition for an eight-hour day,
but ofli rimi the roads as compensa
tion congressional assurances of a
freight rate Increase and a commis
sion to settle future disputes.
Won't AcoVpt Plan.
Among the executives tonight It
clearly was evident that such a
counter-pi oposal probably would not
be uecepted. Whether they would
receive It from President Wilson and
take It uniler consideration for a
few days was not at all certain, but
its ultimate rejection was forecast
generally.
The proposition of the men Is not
clear. Apparently they will not ac
cept the reply of the executives as
It has been published, but they might
be willing to negotiate with It as a
basts. They will meet again at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning. Nobody
knows the attitude of congress toward
the ruii seated legislation. II was
pointed out tonight that there are
many senators who bitterly oppose
the 5 per p.-nt Increase recently gran
ted tin? eastern roads and criticised
tho commission for Its position In the
cese and who might be expected to
bppoee any proposal that would dlrr-'t
the commission to grant another In
crease. The executives appear confi
dent that public opinion will be with
them In their insistence upon the
principle or arbitration and their
Imposition to an eight-hour day.
The executives reply will be divided
Inlo a'.gument and statement of their
p-isit'on. The statement will show
that they do not accept the eight-hour
day with pnv for ten hours a de
manded bv the men; that they main
tain this demand really Is one for an
- Increase In wages and that a question
Vf n ware Increase Is a matter of arbl-
tution and for settlement in no other
way. P will suggest the creutlon of a
commission In arbitrate tills wage
question or delegation of power to the
Interstate commerce commission to
att Urate. It would make the arbitra
tion retroactive and the roads would
pledee themselves to create a fund to
enre for hick wages If Increases are
ai proved by the arbitrator!.

DKNVKR. Col.. Aug. 2.--Charles
K. Hughes today told business
nun of Denver at a luncheon of the
Mile High club that American en
terprise stood face to face with a
new era in which tho watchwords
were "co-operation and efficiency";
that capital and labor " are our two
hands" both of which must be used
intelligently and with co-operation In
the years to come to make "America
first and America efficient."
"A scniie of patriotism was needed
in publio business, he aald, for ihe
United Btatos, the greatest corpora
lien on earth, on its business side was
entitled "to be aa well nianagod aa
eny corporation on earth" and to the
full worth of Ita every dollar spent
In administration.
The business men of America, Mr.
Hughes said, were In hla opinion pa
triotic, broad! sound In their views
and ambitions. The day of building
private citadels alonx the highway
of commerce by which the ordinary
traveler could be held up and pay
tribute, he thought, had passed.
There had been, Mr. Hughes said, a
new consciousness of what Is due the
publio with respect to publio rights
and privileges and because of that he
looked confidently to the future
where otherwise he would look with
"deep dismay."

I 1
OKIaAHOMA CITY, Aug. 28. Just
liko a bomb in the trenches was
the opinion of Attornay-Ooneral
Freeling today to Qovernor Williams
In which a state statute was con
strued which precludes the governor
from selecting civilians for hla offl
clnl staff, which he had done on tak
ing up his duties as governor.
The qucntlon of Whether or not
civilians could constitute his official
taff v.vls presented to the attorney-
general by the govomor several days
ago and was prompted by an act of
congress of June 18 last, known as
the defense act. In whioh It Is Indi
cated that civilians are prohibited
from dressing In regulation uniform.
This act, Mr. Freeling said, had not
been construed by the attorney-gen
eral of the untod States.
Hut asldo from this Mr, Fteeling
rites an Oklahoma statute of 1011,
which makes It a misdemeanor for
anyone other than a member of the
national guard, or member of the
United States army, or the governor's
staff, from wearing such a uniform.
But a 1R1I statute defines whom the
fovernor's staff must be oom posed of.
t says that the governor's stsSf must
be composed of one adjutant-general,
a Judge advocate, with the rank of
major. Who shall be detailed from
the officers of the regimental line,
and the governor may detail one or
more aides-de-camp from the officers
of the national guard In active serv
ice.
Regardless of the national law, the
attorney-general suggests. It would
be unlawful for the governor to se
leot other than members of the na
ltons.1 niard to rn on hla staff.
This will revolutionise the forma
tion of the governor's staff. Here
tofore to be a member of the staff
was counted an honor that the gov
ernor had the privilege to distribute
a'nong his close friends. The stiff
t present constats of his friends.
none of whom belong to the state
mtlltla, or have. There are some six
or seven who bought expensive unl
forms and have only had one or two
occasions to wear them. The hold
Ing of the attorney-general, whioh Is
horns out so emphatically by the
statutes, will prove as much a dls
appointment to the governor as to
those who now compose his staff.
The governor's staff has always been
looked upon as a personal escort

of him he was willing hereafter to
stand alone.
"You dare to lecture mo, saiu wie
fnrmar house leader, "because I dare
to repudiate a part of your bill that
Is a stench In the nostrils of the Dem
ocratic party. I approve of the fi
nance committees legimuuon on mm

son why the finance committee should
see fit to arrogate to Itself tho right
to dictate to others."
Mr. Underwood said It was con

and he had agreed to It he would
stand by It and "bow his neck." He
had bowed unwillingly recently, he
said, to a binding caucus on the im
migration bill. The revenue bill, he
declared, had been "concocted by cer
tain gentlemen In the senate, trying to
dictate to this side of the house what
