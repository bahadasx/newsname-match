<f You have indulged in a lot of
loose talk, Hi Gill, but you
got down to brass tacks on the real
issue. You haven't yet put for
ward one reason, or even ONE
EXCUSE, why you should be
elected mayor again. You can't
fool the people of Seattle anymore.
You can't get votes by calling
Griffiths and his wife names.
CI And calling names and spouting bunk don't answer the bin,
vital question. They don't constitute any grounds as to why you
should be re-elected.
I] Calling Griffiths names doesn't excuse you for keeping a Louie
Lang as chief of police. Calling names doesn't explain why vicc
and gambling have run rampant with petty police graft, under
the cloak of your apparent reform and respectability.
CJ Even the high-faluting statement in the morning paper,
which somebody else wrote for you and to which you signed
your name, doesn't furnish any reasons or any excuses for
your re-election.
If you arc going to depend on TALK,' Hi (»Hl, stick to your
line of stuff. Doji't let some rhetorically-inclined editor put big
words in your mouth. ,
fj To date your.TAJLK comprises these things; •
If You called Griffiths a liar and a can ard:
Q You railed Griffiths' wife a foul name. In the next breath yon
said Griffiths' wife was worth a million dollars when he married
her. In another speech on the same day 'you said she was worth
a half million dollars when he married her.
tf The Star has said, Hi Gill, that you are
a 22-caliber man. This sort of stuff out
of your own mouth proves It.
<f THE STAR IS FOR GRIFFITHS AS
AGAINST YOU FOR MAYOR BECAUSE
GRIFFITHS IS A MAN.
