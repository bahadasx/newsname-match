CAPIURfDTRDtCtlB IN CHAMPAGNE
Premier Briand Says the Germans Were
Caught Between Two Desperate Fires
And Driven Back—Declares Ranks
Were Decimated and Attack
ing Forces Recoiled
The great German offensive on the western front
is assuming a wider scope and importance. Not only is
the impetuous drive on Verdun being pressed vigorous
ly, but aggressive action on a large scale has developed
in Champagne, where the Germans stormed and cap
tured a mile of Flrench trenches.
The new movement on the front is much nearer
Paris than the scene of operations against Verdun.
The Champagne front is approximately 100 miles from
Paris, while the Verdun fighting area is roughly 140
miles distant from the French capital.
North of Verdun, the German lines have been ex
tended. The fiercest of fighting is marking each hour
of the great conflict, with tremendous losses.
Berlin, Feb. 28.—The attempts by the French to
retake the fortress of Douaumont have not only failed,
but the German advance on Verdun continues steadily,
according to reports from the front.
In rapid succession, Louvemont, Chapneuville,
Qote.de. Talu and Hard^nM^tjJijW? been stormed and
ihe Germans, with 15,000.French prisoners in their
hands, now stand less than fivemiles from me center
of Verdun.
CLAIMS SUCCESS IX CHAMPAGNE.
Paris, Feb. 28.—German troop*, by a mirprlso attack, have been
successful In entering certain advanced French trenches near the Na
vartn farm. In the Champagne district.
In the region to the north of Verdun, the bombardment has con
tinued with intensity, particularly in the central sector, and also to
the French right, according to an official statement by the war office.
TRIED TO CAPTURE VIMjAGE.
The German forces Sunday evening made several attempts to cap
ture the village of Douaumont. Their efforts were broken by the re
sistance of French troops, who withstood moat furious assaults.
The situation at the fort of Douaumont Is without change. IMa
fort is closely encircled.
In the Woevre district., the Germans last night assumed the at
titude of greater activity. The railroad station at Eix, after changing
hands several times, finally remains in the possesion of the French.
GERMANS FAIL TO TAKE HILL.
AI1 efforts of the Gcrninns against Hill No. 255, near Eix, are
without result. The Gennun attack against the French positions at
Manheulles resulted in a complete failure. The French artillery Is re
plying with energy to the bombardment of the Germans along this en
tire front today.
CLAIM CAPTURE OF FARM.
Berlin, Feb. 28.—The capture of the Navarin farm in the Cham
pagne district, is announce*! by the war office.
French positions on both sides of the Navarin farm over a front of
about 1,600 yards were taken. It Is said that more than 1,000 men and
nine machinc guns were raptured.
FRENCH RESERVES EXHAUSTED.
In the Verdun region, fresh French reserves were exhausted In ef
forts against the fort of Douaumont. Germans advanced their lines
further toward Bras, Vacheraiiville and made fresli g^ins in the
Woevre district
It is said that all the French have been driven- from the Meuse
peninsula.
DESPERATE COUNTER ATTACKS.
reports
Paris, Feb. 28.—Impeteous counter attacks by the French troops
north of Verdun, in which the Germans were thrown back from many
positions conquered by them during the first four days of the- battle,
according to
from the front, are considered as inaugurating
the second phase of the great action under conditions most favorable
to the defenders.
TEUTONS ARE THROWN BACK.
Premier Briand told representatives of the press how the tide had
turned:
"Uauglit between two llres," said Briand, "covered with shrapnel
from all sides and attacked by our fresh divisions surging upon the
ij field of battle at an unexpected moment, the Germans saw their ef
1 forts stopped short. The struggle was titanic. Our heroic troops
went into the melee frantically. Our light and heavy artillery dug
sanguinary furrows in the compact ranks of the Germans. Finally
exhausted, their ranks decimated, the German armies recoiled under
oar furious conn tor attacks. We have regained the advantage. In
stalled upon formidable positions, our heroic soldiers remained mas
ters of the field of battle."

REAR ADMIRAL
AUSfW TODAY
Atlantic P^et Could Not
Take all Available Ships
—Need Cruisers.
Washington, Fe•!. 28.—The navy
now is ready t® exert more than 50
per cent of its Strength in ships and
guns. Rear Admjfral Austin M. Knight,
president of the navy war college, told
the house naval committee today. He
urged the immediate addition tf 25,
000 enlisted men, and the construc
tion of battle cruisers and scouting
craft to meet the situation.
Equal to Any Built.
The American ships, the admiral
said, are equal to any built and the
officers and men of the fleet are well
trained and efficient, but if the Atlan
tic fleet was ordered out today to de
fend the whole coast line, it would be
unable to tak$. all its available ships
for the lack Of men, and would be
compelled to fight blindfolded for the
lack of scouts.
.Admiral Knight submitted a sketch
of the po^bljT^attiiVMbovements in
the Atlantj$, ttS show that the enemy
fleet could strlkx. virtually where it
pleased unless shouting craft are pro
vided to And th? enemy.
The first step' in the building pro
gram this year, he said, should be the
authorization of six battle cruisers
fuul eight scout cruisers all with a
speed of 35 knots.
The present fleet, Admiral Knight
added, is unbalanced in men and
scouts to such an extent that its
whole defensive mission is endan
gered. The shortage of men, he said,
represented two-thirds of all the trou
ble with the navy.
MANDAN WATER
IS DANGEROUS
Mandan, X. D.. Feb. 28.—The city
board of health has issued a warning
to citizens against using the Missouri
river water for drinking.
An- analysis shows the water to be
heavily contaminated with organic
matter and entirely unfit for drink
ing. The health officers urge that all
water be boiled before use for drink
ing and that this precaution be taken
for a period of at least three weeks.
Washington, Feb. 28.—President
Wilson told members and guests at a
Gridiron club dinner Saturday nijght
that America ought to keep out of
the European war at the sacrifice of
everything except this single thing up
on which her character and her his
tory are founded, her sense -of hu
manity and Justice.
The address was confidential, since
the speeches at the dinners of the
Gridiron club, composed of newspa
per correspondents, are not reported.
It was made public last night, how
ever, with the consent of the president
and the club, because many of those
who heard It urged that it should go
to the country.
Spoke With Gravity.
The president spoke of the nation's
affairs with unusual gravity. His
hearers, including several hundred
members of congress, government offi
cials, business men and correspond
ents were brought to their feet cheer
ing when he concluded with these
words: I
"I would be just as much ashamed I
to be rash as I would to be a coward.'
Valor Is self-respecting. Valor is I
circumspect. Valor strikes only when
It Is right to strike. Valor withholds
Itself from all small implications and
entanglements, and walta for the great
opportunity when the aword will flash
as If It carried the light of heaven up
on Its blade." .,

THRILLING RESCUE BY
SIXTEEN MOLD BOY
Takes Companion From River After
He is Almost Frozen
to Death.
uskaloosa, lowa J^b. '28.—In a
thrilling rescue by Ray EUls, a 16
year-old boy, Charles Thomas was
taken late Saturday night, half frozen
and nearly lifeless, from a tree in the
flood and ice packed Des Moines river
where he had clung to the branches
several hours after seeing a com
panion drown.
Thomas and K. A. Rommell, Mahas
ka county engineers, attempted to
dynamite the ice floe when they wer
swept into the stream, Rommell per
ishing. Thomas caught the top of a
tree which had been partly submerged
by the flood. lodging his boat against
two other trees Ellis threw a rope in
Thomas so the latter could make it
fast to a branch of the tree. Ellis
secured this end and Thomas slid
down.
Death nearly balked the rescue at
the last moment. In his slide down
the rope Thomas, exhausted, dropped
into the water. He sank but the bo\
seized him when he came up and
dragged him into the skiff. Tifforts to
break the ice pack still have hron
unavailing and last night the flood
was increasing, lowlands being: cov
ered and farms threatened.
except to express my warm appre
ciation of the invariable courtesy of
this club, and of the reception you
have so generously accorded me. I
find that 1 am seldom tempted to say
anything now-adays unless somebody
starts something and tonight nobody
has started anything.
"Tour talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has
been a great deal about candidacy for
the presidency, it is not a new feel
ing on my part, but one which I en
tertain with a greater intensity than
formerly, that a man who seeks the
presidency of the United States for
any thing that it will bring to him is
an audacious fool. The responsibili
ties of the office ought to sober a
man even if he approaches It. One of
the difficulties Of the office seldom,
appreciated, I dare say, is that It Is
very difficult to think while so many
people are talking, and particularly
whlltB so many people are talking in a
way that obscures counsel and is en
tirely off the point.

"The point in national affairs, gen

expediency. It always rests in the

PENNSYLVANIA EXCEEDS
SPEED REQUIREMENTS
New Superdradnaught Pushed at Rate
of 21.75 Knots an Hour—Tests
Held Yesterday.
Rockland, Me., Feb. 2S.—A speed
three-quarters of a knot in excess of
contract requirements was attained by
the superdreadnauglit Pennsylvania
when she was pushed on the fastest
mile of her standardization tests at
the rate of 21.75 knots an hour yes
terday. Eleven runs were made to
complete the tests halted by thick
weather last Thursday.
The average for five high speed
runs was 21.38 knots per hour. Three
runs each were made at 19 and 2]
knots. In her record spurt the big
ship, which has been hailed by Amer
ican naval officers as the newest and
most powerful fighter afloat, was
driven by her propellers at the rate
of 216.4 revolutions a minute. In
making her contract speed of 21
knots, 210 revolutions a minute, were
necessary.
The board of Inspection and survey
that is conducting the trials summed
up the day's work as "a very success
ful trial." They said the engines
worked smoothly, the oil burners pro
duced little smoke and there was a
marked absence of vibration.
The Pennsylvania has yet to make
her twelve hour full power run. Her
actual displacement today was 31,
180 tons and her estimated maximum
horsepower 32.000. Captain W. G.
Melvln of Newport News was the nav
igating officer.
EXPERTS TO
REEMPLOYED
Negotiations will be Exam
ined by Handwriting
Professionals.
Chicago, Feb. 28.—Comparison of
the writing and notations on the
checks introduced as evidence in the
civil service commission's investiga
tion of the Easton-Rowe split salary
scandal will be mad« by a handwrit
ing expert. President Coffin of the
commission admitted yesterday. In
vestigation will be resumed today. The
checks and stubs involved purport to
record Mrs. Page Waller Eaton's re
sponse to the alleged order of her su
perior, Mrs. Louise Osborne Rowe, su
perintendent of the bureau of public
welfare, that she contribute a third of
her $3,000 salary. According to Mrs.
Eaton, Mrs. Rowe's request was based
on the now famous "Maizie says we've
got to come across** order from the
wife of Mayor Thompson. The money
is alleged by Mrs. Eaton to have been
ostensibly for Mrs. Thompson's sister,
Mrs- Margaret E. Mivelaz.
Mrs. Eaton testified that she drew
thirteen checks and turned the pro
ceeds in cash over to Mrs. Rowe.
Checks and stubs were marked. The
first one bore the legend "For Mrs.
Thompson's sister," and the corre
sponding stub was marked "for the
L. O. R. charity fund." Other checks
were similarly identified.
"Under the microscope" said Presi
dent Coffin, "it looks as if the nota-.
tions were written after the body of
the checks had been filled in. The
ink seems different and the writing
looks as if it had been done while the
writer was in a position different from
that in which the amounts and signa
ture were written. However, it re
mains for an expert to determine
this."
Seymour Stedman, attorney for Mrs.
Eaton, is expected to introduce a new
witness to the alleged transfer of
money today. The witness, like Al
derman Rodriguez and Fulton Gard
ner, ia said to have seen Mrs. Eaton
hand an envelope containing money to
Mrs. Rowe.

New German Mines.
The British press is almost
unanimous in assuming that
the Maloja and other vessels
sunk by mines during the
week-end were victims of the
fresh sowing of German
mines. The theory most fre
quently advanced is that a
certain class of neutral ship
ping is employed in laying
these mines.
The Pall Mall Gazette sug
gests that such operations
may drive England to still
more stringent supervision
of neutral shipping than have
yet been exercised by the ad
miralty.
Struck Mine Yesterday.
Dover. F"eb. 28.—The steamer Mal
oja, a 12,431 ton vessel belonging to
the Peninsular and Oriental line,
struck a mine and sank within a half
hour two miles off Dover yesterday.
Forty persons were drowned or killed
as a result of the accident.
The Maloja left Tilbury only yes
terday for Bombay with mails, 119
passengers of all classes aboard, and
a crew numbering about 200, most of
them Lascars. Other passengers were
to join the ship at Marseilles.

One of them, the British tanker
