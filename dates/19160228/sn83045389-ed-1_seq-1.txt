In the controversy. over this feature
of the Mapp hill in the House. there
will enter :i faotoi which was of com- ;
paratively small moment in tin Sen- '
ate? the position ??t" the Republican
minority. On at lea.-* two occasions;
during this .session tin Republican.-- of j
the House heltl t he balance of" power
when bills of Stutc-Hitlc significance
weto undet discussion. To tin- .-olid .

passage of I he judges pension repeal 1

popular elect ion of school trustees. It
was the s"li?l front presented b> the
minority, also. that forced the House!
to pass a "milk-and-water" prepared- ]
ness resolution in place of the uncon
ditional resolution which was voted
down
It is understood that the Republi
cans. who have seventeen x otes in the ?
House, will hold a caucus or confer- |
once this week to .sound the views of
the members 011 the cotnmissionership
feature and other provisions of the I
Mapp bill. Republican Floor l.eader
Rowry is himself in favor of a plan ?
for enforcing the prohibition l ?w.- dif- ?
ferettt from the one proposed b\ the;
Senate lull, and is of the belief lha.ll
the minority will tind if possible to act'
in concert.
Should the I?emocrats of the llotiso
develop a division of opinion on the '
tommissionership feature as sharp as
the division in Senate over the tTonrad ,
amendment making the Attorney-?.;??n- j
eral ex oflieio commissioner of prohibi- ?
tion, tiie action of the Republican ,
minority voting in concert would as- j
sunie a fateful significance. It is not]
beyond the realm of reasonable prob- '
ability that the minority may find itself ?
in a position to cast tin- deciding vote. '

COMICS I I' TU-ll \ V j
It was pointed out in this connection'
last night that the Republicans, other (
things being equal, would be forced to :
vote for the popular election of tins:
prohibition commissioner as against '
the plan to elect him by the ? Sonera! !
Assembly. I'nder the latter plan, the j
legislature would elect the nominee'
of the Oeniocrntic caucus, thus virtual- j
l.v depriving the minoritv of any voice)
in the election.
First place on the legislative cal
endar to-day is held by the co-ordinato
college bill, which comes up as a ni?e- |
oial and continuing order at I2:S0 \
o'clock in the Semite.
The companion bill in tin* House is!
on its second reading, and will in all ;
probability be reached to-day in the ;
regular course of businens. It will '
probably lie. passed by temporarily, '
pending final action b> the Senate,'
since if the measure is defeated in |
that body the House will be spared
hours of useless debate. It is not hi-- '
licved that the Senate will vote on the,
bill until to-morrow.
Two other special orders promise to
keep the Senate well occupied foi the
rest of this week. The game bill is ;
fixed for 12:110 o'clock to-morrow after- j
noon, and the antivice bill as a special
order Immediately following. In eon- !

prohibition bill, 'he Senate calendar!

The captain from the bridge directed
the lowering of the boats, and called
on e\eryhod> to keep enlm. and every
body obeyed, though the scene imme
diately after the explosion was one
sufficiently terrifying to cause a panic.
.Several children were blown to'pb ces,
and the deck was covered with wreck
age and wounded, but there was no
sign of a panic.
Only a few boats could lie lowered,
and the heavy sea made the rescue
work diflicult. The majority of thoso
saved were on rafts, of which the ship
carried a large number. Most of the
women and children lost their lives
owing to the fact that one boat already
in the water drifted under anot bet
ween was being lowered and oapfiKed.

The President spoke of the nation's '
affair- with unusual gravity. Ilisi
hearers. inch;<iintr se\cral hundred ;
members of ?'?nnrc.ss. government of
tibials, business men and correspon
dents. were brought to their feet cheer- '
ing when h<' concluded with these1
words:
"f would he just us tiHicli ashamed to
he rash as I would to he a coward, j
Valor is self-re.?.peetlng. Valor is cir- ?
etiinspect. Valor strikes only when it
is riyht to strike. Valor withholds
itself from all small implications and
entanglements. and waits f? ? i the great
opportunity when the sword will flash
as if it carried the light of Heaven '
upon its blade."
The address follows.
" I have very little to sa\ to-night. I
except to expr-.ss my warm apprecia- 1
tion of the invariable courtesy of this ;
club and of the reception you have <o
generously accorded me. I find that 1
am seldom tempted to say anything ?
nowadays unless somebody starts some- ,
thine, ami to-night, nobody has started ?
anything.

"Vour talk. Mr. Toastmaster. has boon i
a ureal deal about candidacy fur the'
presidency. It is not a new feeling on j
my part, but one which 1 entertain with ,
a greater intensity than formerly, that |
| a man who seeks the presidency of }
the United States for anything that t? i
will bring to him i.s an audacious fool. !
The responsibilities of the ofTice ought ,
to sober u man even before ho ap- j
proaohes it. One of the difficulties of ?
the office .seldom appreciated. I dare I
say. is that it is very difficult to think '
? while so many people are talking, and |
particularly while so many people are |
: talking in a way that obscures counsel
; and is entirely off the point.
"The point tn national affairs, gentle
; men. never lies along the lilies of ex
| pedieney. It always rests in the tield
: of principle The l.'nited States was '
i not founded upon any principle of ex-'
pedieney: ii was founded upon a i>ro- .
found principle o. human liberty and
of humanity, ami whenever it bases its |
policy upon any other foundations than ,
' those, it builds on the sands and not |
I upon solid rock. It seems to ine that
I the most enlightening thing an Ameri
I can can do is suggested by something
i which the Vice-President said to-uight.
j lli- complained that lie found men who.
; when their attention was called to the
: siyns of spring, did not see the hlue j
heaven, did not see the movement of 1
j the free clouds, did not think of the
j great spaces of the quiet continent, but j
thought unlj of some immediate and
' pressing piece of business. It seems j
! to nit; that if you do not think of the i
! things that lie beyond and awa> from i
| and disconnected from this seem- in
! which we attempt, to think and con
, elude, you will inevitably be led astray.
I would a great deal rather know what !
they are talking about around fiuiet
| firesides all over this eountrj than what
I they are talking about in the cloak
; rooms of Congress. I would a great
deal rather know what the men on
the trains and by the wayside and in |
! llif shops and on ihe farms are think
ing about and \earning for than hear '
, any of the vociferous proclamations
| of policy which it is so easy to hear
| aim so easy to read b> picking up any 1
i scraps of printed paper. There is only ,
I one way to hear these things, and that
, is constantly jo go hack to the foun
tains of American action. Those foun- 1
; tains are not to he found in any re- ;
i e?*ntl\ discovered sources.

'Senator Harding was saying just
: now that we ought to tr\ when we are
10(1.000,000 strong to a<-i in the same
, simplicity of principle that our fore
fathers acted in when we we re 3,i)liii,0ti0
strong. I heard somebody say--I do
not know the exact statistics- that the
present population of the United States
is lox.0o0.000. If there arc XOOO.Oon

i inal 000,00" thought, the- 100.000.000
will be saved for an illustrious future.
They were ready to stake everything for
an Idea, and that idea was not ex
pediency. but justice. And the infinite
' difficulty of public affairs, gentlemen, is
not to discover the signs ??I* the heaven
and the directions of the wind, but to
j N(|uare the things you do b> the not
simple but complicated standards of
? justice. Justice has nothing to do with ?
j expediency. Justice has nothing to do |
I with any temporary standard whatever.
It is rooted ami grounded in the funda- .
? mental instincts of humanity.
"America ought to keep out of this
war. She ought to keep out of the
! war at the sacrifice of everything >x
! oept this single thing upon which
j her character and history are founded
? her sense of humanity and justice.

Following the reduction in ihe

tive Hoard will next turn its attention
to the t'ity Kngineet'ing department,
the number of employees of which will
be reduced t?? meet the appropriation

this year's buiipet.
tt is stated that the board will bo
Kin with tin; engineering force itself
and its clerical help, and, after reduc
ing that, po to the. laboring force,
showing" no partiality as between
skilled and unskilled labor.
During the last two years the Kn

?2.f>00.ii00 in .street, alley and other im
provement'. but this year tin* Finance
Committee appropriated only 5150.^00

either departments will come in for j

and in the next few weeks lliehtnond ;
will be confronted with si small army j
of men, many of whom have spent the J
host years of their life in the city's sor- |
vice, who are without employment. ,
The majority of them are married men, ?
with l.i rue families dependent upon
them. and unskilled except in the sort
of worlc they have performed for years,
most of them are unfitted for other)
employ ment.
They will form a tax on the Kinploy
mcnt iiureau. on the Associated e'hari
ties and on other relief organizations.
The Administrative Hoard can do noth
ing for them, for the hoard is com- ?
pelled to live within the limit of the j
funds appropriated to its use. And the ;
hoard is forbidden to come hack to the
Finance Committee save, for ait enter
geiicy need.
It is significant that not withstami
in.n* so many ate to he thrown out of
employment. the city has appropriated
$4,000 for music in the parks. Tiiis ap

it several days ago. Chnmpneuvllle.
to llie west, and the. fortified works of
Iiardamont, to the east of Fort. Douau
motit. have been captured by the Ger
mans. Berlin also claims to have cap
tured the ? ,'ote -de-Ta lou. to the west
of Douiiumont. but. according to the
French ollieial statement, the artillory
Tire coming from both sides has ren
dered this position untenable for
either French or Germans.
The French are hurling attack after
attack upon the Douaumont positions
held by the Germans, who are declared
to be maintaining themselves there
with dillleulty, but in the Woevre re
gion, to the east of Verdun, the French
advanced posts have been withdrawn.
The losses on both sides aro mount
ing by tens of thousands. The Berlin
report puts the captures of unwounded
prisoners to date at 15.000.
l.arge re-enforcements are being
brought vip probably by both forces,
and it is reported that the British lines
are being extended in Belgium and in
France, in order that troops may be
released for the Verdun battle.
In the Vosgcs Mountains the Ger
mans also started a heavy offensive
southeast of Cellep, but it was com
pletely checked by the French. On the
other extreme end of the lino around
Ypres, a British attack was repulsed
by the Germans.
Between Soissons and Kheima a
vigorous bombardment has been car
ried out against the German positions.
