Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. Germany
has instructed Count Von Bernstorff
to inform the United States govern
ment that the assurances regarding the
future conduct of submarine warfare,
given in the Lusitania and Arabic
cases still are binding, but that they
apply only to merchantmen of a peace
ful character. The German govern
ment is understood to contend that
armed merchantmen without regard to
the nature of their armament, have
shown themselves not to be peaceful
and therefore subject to destrction
without warning.
The instructions uireet the German
ambassador particularly to tell Secre
tary Lansing that British merchant
men armed ostensibly only for defense
have not assumed the character of
peaceful traders but that on the con
trary, they carry guns, for the especial
purpose of attacking German subma
rines. To support this connection the
Berlin foreign office has sent the am
bassador, for presentation to the state
department, a list of at least twenty
incidents where it is claimed British
merchant ships have attacked subma
rines. Confidential advices received from
Berlin state that German and Austrian
submarine commanders already have
been given their new orders and that
from midnight Tuesday they will be
authorized to sink without warning all
armed merchant ships of the enemies
of Germany. It was said also that
many of the submarine commander
probably had left their base on voy
ages and that even should the United
States request the postponing of the
opening of the campaign, it would be
impossible to get word to many of tho
submarines. It was stated, however,
that so far neither the United States
nor any other nation had asked for a
postponment.
While Count Von Bernstorff and oth
er officials of the German embassy de
clined to discuss the instructions from
Berlin in any way, it is believed the
ambassador will present them orally
to Secretary Lansing tomorrow.
They will not, it was said, take the
form of a note unless Secretary Lan
sing desires it. Count Von Bernstorff
received his instructions in reply to a
request form the United States fo--ussurances
regarding the conduct of
submarine warfare in the future, oc
casioned by the memorandum announc
ing the intention of Germany to sink
armed ships without warning, which
the administration considered to be
inconsistent with the assurances pre
viously given.
Regardless of form in which the mat
ter Is presented to Secretary Lansing,

in Belgium and France in order
that French troops may be re

Marine disasters are again a

steamers have been blown up by

of England in the North sea has
set powerful mines adrift.

Address Before Gridiron
Club Is Confidential, But
Is Mftde Pujblic Because
of Urgings of Those Who
Heard It
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON', Feb. 27. President
Wilson tola members and guests at a.
gridiron club dinner last night that
America ought to keep out of the Eu
ropean war "at the sacrifice of every
thing except this single thing upon
which her character and her history
pre founded, her sense of humanity and
justice."
The address was confidential, since
the sieeches at the dinners of the grid
iron club, composed of newspaper cor
respondents, are not reported. It was
made public tonight, however, because
many of those who heard it urged that
it should go to the country.
The president spoke of the nation's
affairs with-unusual gravity. His hear
ers, including several hundred mem
bers of congress, government officials,
business men and correspondents, were
brought to their feet cheering when he
concluded with these words:
"I would be just as much ashamed
to be rash as 1 would to be a coward.
Valor is self-respecting. Valor is cir
cumspect. Va'.or strikes only when it
is right to strike. Valor withholds itself
from all small implications and entan
glements and waits for the great oppor
tunity when the sword will flash as
if it carried the light of heaven on its
1 lade." ,
The address in part follows:
"Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster. has
been a great deal about candidacy for
the presidency. It is not a new feeling
! on my part, but one which I entertain
j with a greater intensity than formerly,
that a man who seeks the presidency of
the United States for anything that 11
will bring to him is an audacious fool.
The responsibilities of the office ought
to sober a man even before he ap
proaches it. One of the difficulties of
the office seldom appreciated, I "dare
say, is that it is very difficult to think
while so many people are talking, and
oarticulerly while so many people are
talking in a way that obscures counsel
and is entirely off the point.
"The point in national affairs, gen
tlemen,' never lies along the lines of
expediency. It always rests in the
field of principle. The United States
was not founded upon any principle of
expediency; it was founded upon a pro
found principle of human liberty and
of humanity, and whenever it bases its
olicy upon any other foundations than
those, if. builds on the sand and not
upon the solid rock.
"It seems to me that if you do not
think of the things that lie beyond and
away from and disconnected from this
scene in which we attempt to think
and conclude, you will inevitably be led
astray. I would a great deal rather
know what they are talking about
around quiet firesides all over this
