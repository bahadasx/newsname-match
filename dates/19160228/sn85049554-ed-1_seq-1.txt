Washington, Feb. 28.—In a note pre
sented to Secretary Lansing today by
Germany as
sure* the United States that it has n®
intention of revoking the pledgee given
in the Lusitania case.
The note says Germany can conceive
of no reason for changing or postponing^
the new instructions to her submarine
commanders to treat as warships en.
emy merchant ships armed "defen
sively" and precautions have been
taken to prevent ships not armed from
being attacked.
The note at the outset reiterated the
previous ^pledges which were given on
Sept. and Oct. 5, last year, for the
safety of unresisting liners, and then
goes on to say the German govern
ment does not believe those assurances
have been modified by the new mem
orandum.
During the negotiations over the Lu
sitania no mention waa made of armed
raerchantment, it says, and that the
United States ln one note on the lusi
tania mentions armed merchantmen.

Germany contends a similar view*
