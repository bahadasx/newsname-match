The victims of as cold-blooded ft

At that hour, J. H. Brlnlgar. going

hout 80 feet apart by tbe roadside,
while abort distance away waa tbe
team that the Akera had been driv
ing, one horao already dead and the
other near to death, having been

Neighbor la Suspected
Lying near tbe aeene of the tragedy
waa found the canea that it waa
known M. D. Bousman, who owned
an adjoining farm to that of the
Akera, had been In tbe habit of car
rying, and auiplclon at once pointed
to Bousman. It waa alao known that
there had been trouble between the
Akera and Bouaman for a number of
year, and that the latter had threat
ened violence to both Mr. and Mrs.
Akera on varloua occasion. Boua
man had, In fact, been placed under
bonda at one time to observe tho
peace. The trouble between the
arbors bad been cauaed by dis
pute's over fencea and by the allow
ing of the Bousman bogs to run at
Urge. (
Bowman Arreeted
When Sliorlff Smith waa notlflod ot
the tragedy, he left at once with
Deputy Donnlson for tbe aeene, go

When they rapped upon the door,

Prisoner (nfcsftt'f; tho Crime
Tbe prisoner, who gave his age to
the Courier representative attor he
had boen lodged in he County jail
lato at night aa 63 years', looks to be
fully 70, his hair lions gray and his
Ions beard noarly k',te. As ho sat
upon tho edge of thy ret within the
Btool cage ho 'talked ireoly of tho
murdor and of the causes that lod up
to It. Ho showed no remorse at his
act, but soomod rather to wlBh to
justify hlmsolf for tho killing. He
rocountod tho differences that had
grown up botwoon hlmoslf and the
Akers during a period of four or
five years, .the chief contention, ac
cording to him, having been over his
having allowed his stock to run at
large. Ho said that flrBt he had
raised goats, but because tlicHo
trondulod bis neighbors lie had sold
them And gone Into the hog business,
The precinct votod not to allow bogs
to run at large, and the Akera made
complaint when hla bogs broke
through their fencea and destroyed
their cropa. Tbe matter waa taken
up with the county "bfflclals, and
County Attorney Miller wrote Boua
man ft number of times, and finally
Bouaman waa placed under bond to
kcop the peace because of hla num
erous threats against Mr. and Mra.
Akers. This waa nearly a year ago.
Trouble. Ia Itenewed
" Recently it bad become necessary
for the Akera to appeal to the county
attorney again, and on tbe 23rd of
February he had written Bouaman
stating that Mr. Akers had again en
tered complaint. It waa the receipt
of tbta letter, Bousman aald, that bad
ao enraged blm that be concluded to
take tbe Uvea of hla neighbors. And
tbe aged man's eyes gleamed aa be
recounted the atory of tbe morning
of the crime. He waa oool and satis
fied, rather than sorry that be bad
the blood of a worthy couple upon
hla hands.
"I put seven shells In my rifle and
went down the road to within about
a hundred yards ot tbe Akera house,"
be told the Courier man. 'There I
bid In -the- brash by the- roadlde,
knowing that 'Akera and bla wife
would aoon come along on their way
to Sunday school. I lay in tbe brush
tor some time, and I knew when the
team was hitched up and when the
Akers wore ready to start. Then my
heart seemed to fall me, and I
thought to myself, 'I can't take tbe
lives of those old people," and I
started down the road. Then the
Akera camo driving toward me, and
tbe first thing I kntw I was shooting.
Shoots at Horn First
"First I fired ft shot at one of the
horses. Then I ahot the woman. At
that Akers got out of the wagon,
though I had woundod him before
be got out, and came at me with a
pleco of ttoard to fight me. I kept
ahootlng, and the first thing I knew
I bad fired all seven shots. Then I
went home."
When Informed tbat both horBos
were doad, Bousman claimed not to
remonvber having shot the second
one, and said thnj when he left the
scene neither horse had fallen. The
evidence ot those first on the ground
would Indicate that the horse lived
for some Umo after the shooting.
They had gone a short distance from
the road where they had been stop

were killed, and there one horse bad'
