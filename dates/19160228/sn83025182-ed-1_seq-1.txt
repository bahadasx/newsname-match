BERLIN, Feb. 28.—Verdun's fall
within possibly a fortnight, was pre
dicted by Q«rman military critics to
day as stories arrived from the front,
telling of the destruction wrought by
the great German howitzers.
They pointed out that no fortress
since the beginning of the war has
withstood the German battering, once
the ring of defending forts has been
breached.
Douaumont was laid In ruins on
Thursday, the day before the Bran
den-burgers stormed and captured the
wrecked positions.
"Four shots of our heavy guns were
fired against Douaumont and every
one scored a bull's eye on the distant
target," said dispatches from the
front. "Explosions In the Interior of

BtEIRLEN (via wireless to SajnrlUe)
Feb. 28.—'The semi-official North Ger
man Gazette commenting on Presi
dent Wilson's letter to Chairman
Stone of the senate foreign relations
committee, declares that Germany's
new submarine warfare on merchant
men will not be in violation of inter
national law.
"The principles stated in the Ger
man memorandum are by no means
contrary to international law," said
the Gasette, "for secret orders of the
English navy, published in th6 mem
orandum, expressly Instruct armed
English merchantmen not only to de
fend themselves, but to attaok.
Numerous incidents In the memor
andum give further proof that ships
follow this instruction. Such ships,
however, cease to be peaceful trading
ships, according to international law.
On the other hand the attitude
adopted by ou renemies appears as a,
gross breach of the law of nations,
since they commit acts of warfare
with merchantmen to which only real
men of war are qualified."
[Tiie above dispatch from the Ber
lin correspondent of the United Press
Is the first statement coming from
Berlin that Germany does not Intend
to torpedo without warning, passenger
liners, even though armed. It Indi
cates Germany Intends to fulfill the
pledge made through Ambassador
Bernstorff after the Arabic sinking,
despite the new order, placing all
armed merchantmen in the category
of ships of war.
There Is almost a flat contradiction,
however, in the statement that armed
liners In the futuro will no longer be
considered "legitimate peaceful trad-
(Oontlnued on page 2.)
KEEP OUT OF WAR IF POSSIBLE,
BUT NOT AT COST OF HONOR
press haB materially altered its previ
ously mi favorable opinion of the presi
dent. Wilson today is doubtless al
most as popular a figure in England
as Colonel Roosevelt.
After conversations with scores of
follow countrymen on the trains, in
cities, towns and country villages, on
tho streets, in the store and by the
fireside and returning to Washington
just after the publication of the Stone
correspondence, it seemed almost as
if Wilson were speaking by direct
mandat.o from the people, despite the
fact that their representatives in
congress were apparently not all of
the same mind.
But the Britisher would make a
previous mistake were he to concluda
that fhe president is about to plunge?
the country ruthlessly into war. As
he indicated in his Gridiron speech,
he Is qnite as much concerned lest
the country err on the side of rash
ness as on the side of cowardice. The
Impression in Germany today that he
Is really seeking a break with thti
teutonic powers is Just as far from the
truth as the notion prevailing in Eng
land recently that he was secretly fla
voring the German cause.
To the charge of inconsistency, Wil
son's friends reply that he has struck
a new note and that his patience and
forebearattce in the tedious and some
times exasperating negotiations with
Germany have not been indicative of
weakness or even temporary surren-
