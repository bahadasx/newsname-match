London, Feb. 28. French reinforce
ments in great numbers have today
checked the German drive toward
Verdun but there are indications that
the Germans have transferred their at
tack to the Champagne section.
North and east of Verdun the Ger
man fire has slackened but has not
entirely stopped at several points.
In the Champagne section a fierce
artillery fire hist night was followed
today by Infantry assault on the
French line from which troops have
been drawn to strengthen the defence
of Verdun.
London, Feb. 27. The palatial 12.
BOOton passenger liner Majola, of the
Peninsular and Oriental line, was
struck by a floating mine at 10:30
o'clock this morning when midway
between Dover and Folkestone, and
sank within thirty minutes after Its
afteP part had been blown away In a
terrific explosion. There were 119
passengers and a crew of about 300
aboard.
At last accounts the number of dead
was reported "more than forty." It
is feared the actual number of victims
may bo between 150 and 200. The
Times gets the death list at 147. No
Americans are believed to have been
aboard.
The mine which caused the Majola'a
destruction la believed to have been
one of the large net spread by the
Dritish navy for the protection of Eng
land's coast against German Naval
raiders. - ?' j f)1f e:';

18 POUNDS OF BLOOD
is the average quantity in a healthy

that determines our strength to resist
sickness. With weak blood we find
cold hands and chilly feet; in children
an aversion to study,' and in adults
rheumatic tendencies s,
In changing seasons get abundant
fresh air and take a spoonful of Scott's
Emulsion after meals, because Scott's
Emulsion is a rich blood-food that will
increase both quantity and quality of
the blood while it warms the body and
helps carry off the impurities. ,
When multitudes of people are to
day talcing Scott's Emulsion to avert
winter sickness, and are giving it to
their children, it is careless to neglect
Its benefits. ' Look out for substitutes.

Loudon, Feb. 8. Five determined

with sanguinary! losses! : according to
the official statement issued at , Ber

asserted, had stormed the fortified
works of Hardaiimont a3 well as the
town of Champnouvllle and" the Cote
de Talou. The number of unWounded
Frenchmen taken prisoners, it was ad
ded, totaled 15(000. '
Except around Fort Douaumont,
the French war office, in Paris reports
some abatement of ' the German at
tacks north of t Verdun. East and
west of the Douaumont position the
French troops are closely pressing the
German detachments which were able
to gain a footing in those sections,
and which, the war office further re
ports, are maintaining themselves
with difficulty. The French deny that
the Germans haveoccupled the Cote
de Talou. It was admitted - that the
French advanced posts in the Woevre
district were withdrawn, but It was
declared that this was effected in an
orderly manner' Add without interfer
ence on the part of the Germans.

more than ouco at right angles. From
that passage you stepped Into a huge

. A.sluglo electric bulb was suspend

they believed that what remained of
it on reaching the tunnel entrance
would automatically close the half open

would have l-ost the city $5,000 worth

The passage from the tunnel has
been closed with solid concrete, but
the huge cavern is still there, hidden
deep in the rock on which the great
city is built Slowly, very slowly, it
will fill tip with a silent, motionless
pool of water, never to reflect the
faintest gleam of light In time, no
doubt, the existence of the cavern will
be forgotten. A thousand or twoy
years hence it may be rediscovered.

W. R. C. ENTERTAINS
Adams and North Adams Corps Guests
of Local Society. ;
Saturday, February 26, the W. R. C.
entertained the W . R. C. of Adams
and North Adams and the local Post
members in honor of Washington's
birthday. A meeting was held at 3 p.
m., with a supper at 6 o'clock, follow
ed by a musical which was much en
joyed by all.
One of the pleasant features of the
meeting was the presentation of a
flag to the post by Junior-Vice Dept.
President Ruth E. Smith, which was
done in a very able manner, and
responded to by the commander.
The visitors left at a late hour after
thanking Custer Sixth Corps for the
pleasant manner in which they . were
entertained.
An Example of Turkish.
Everybody who has tackled German
knows the strain of waiting for the
verb at the end of tho sentence which
will explain what it is all about Turk
ish goes several worse than thai, giv
ing the words In almost exactly re
verse order to our own. Sir Charles
Eliot cites as a typical Turkish sen
tence. "Capital and Varna between
running Lloyd of company of Vulcan
steamer on Siambonl to coming are
we." Read that backward and Its
meaning becomes clear. Obviously
such a langungo should avoid loug sen
tences. Popular Turkish does, but
Turkish writers Indulce in mlirbtv
mazes that should be quite congenial
to German professors. London Chron
