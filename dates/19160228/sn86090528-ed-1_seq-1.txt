REPEAL OF

IS OPPOSED
Congress Again in Throes of Tariff Fight
with Lobbyists Active; Partisan Poli
tics Plays Prominent Part in
Proceedines
KITCHIN VOICES VIEW
OF ADMINISTRATION
Introduces Resolution Calling for Continu
ance of of Present Duty as Sug
gested by President; Needed
as War Revenue Measure
By United Press.
WASHINGTON', D, C, Feb. 28. The
house ways and means committee to
day voted unanimously to report out
the Kitchin bill repealing the free su-
l.iir provision of the Underwood-Sim
mons tariff law.
By BOND F. CEDDES.
United Press Statf Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 28. Cor.-
f ress today is in thu throes of another
tariff fight. Partisan politics is at fe
ver heat. Lobbyists are busy. The
American i-ugar bowl is the cause.
'Frte sugar" is the battle cry.
Repeal of the clause in the new Wil-
bon Underwood tariff a''t which would
place sugar on the free list, removing
i.bout 1 pi r cent a pound duty, on May
1 is the proposal causing the turmoil.
The result lias far-reaching effect on
the American and foreign sugar grow
ing and refining Industries, as -well a
on the price the people shall pay to fill
their sugar bowls.
Initiated In the hotiBe by Democratic
Leader Kitchin, the resolution propos
ing that the present duty of approxi
mately 1 cent a pound Khali be con
tinued on sugar if an administration
measure, urged by President Wilson In
hit; opening message to congress last
December. Because of declining reve
nues caused by tha war, President
Wilson ai;ked that the free sugar
fchedule be rescinded. The Kitchin
les'ilutmr. pro'ldes for Its outright re
peal and not lis indefinite Biropen
Kion. The administration leaders In on
Kress today are contending that the
war make necessary continuance of
Fiigar duties, probably the biggest sin
gle source of custom duty revenues.
In 101 j the net revenue from sugar
vas $4.,flC',000. The Democrats con
tend that but for the war, with its dU
turbance of commerce and curtailment
of customs receipts, the treasury would
not have needed the sugar revenue.
. On the other hand, the Republicans
are loudly proclaiming that the Dem
ocrats are admitting and rectifying
a serious error in their tariff, revision
of 1913 when they pased tha Wilson
Underwood bill. Both political fac
tions ara making the utmost capital o
this situation for this year's presiden-
tial campaign purposes.
mL , - - .,1 inlv la.

about cent less than that of tne
Payne - Aldrich tariff act. The Wilson-Underwood
bill prop6sed to take
off the tariff piece-meal, leaving free
sugar to become effective on May
Ht.
Many Democrats are opposing out
right repeal, urging instead, indefinite
suspension of the free sugar proviso
en that when war conditions become
adjusted sugar can be made duty free
without cumbersome legislation. They
tilo believe such a course would min
imize republican charges that they ad
niit having made a basic error.
Republicans in both the senate and
house are for the Democratic resolu
tion to continue the present duty. But
they insist first on taunting the Demo
crats for the alleged mistake.
Passage of the duty-continuing reso
lution, with both parties voting for it.
Is expected eventually after a long
wordy war.
Tariff experts ray the repeal of free
fugar will not arfect present retail
prices to the consumer. Effect of par
tial tariff reduction already has been
felt, they declare.
But a big revival in the American
sugar industry, both cane and beet, U
expected to result from continuing the
present duty. W 1th. the 1-cent-a pound
irotection Louisiana cano growers,
ho put their canefleld In other
crops when the sugar schedule was re
Jised downward, arc reported planting
new crops. Increased acreage of su-
par bets and more production in west
ern beet sugar factories is also ex
petted.
Political effects are bound up iu the
sugar question. Following the Louis
iana can growers' declaration tha
"free sugar" would ruin them, a pro
gressive congressman was elected last
year from that rockbound Democratic
slate. .
An interesting story Is told In con
nection with the sugar tariff. Presi
dent Wilson, himself, It is said, was
most insistent upon making sugar duty
iree. Senator Underwood, then house
leader, bitterly opposed it, but at the
president's behest finally wrote the
"free sugar" clause in the bill. Then It
was est'mated the indirect tax burden
upon consumers would 'be reduced
$115,000,000 a year. Whether the re
fillers or the consumers would 'benefit
by the reduced tariff has Jjceri and -is
rtil! a point of partisan debate.

filty gallons of 'cooking oil, according
to statements given out by the police

large tank holding several hundred
gallons. From the tank the oil is
drawn through faucets.

that the police department learned of
last night's burglary when phone

AUTO TAX IS
RETURNED

$293.77 is Due City; Used
for Upkeep of Roads
SINKING FUNDS OF

Treasurer Purchases District and County
Warrants Bearing 6 Percent Interest
Instead of Keeping Money on
Deposit at 4 Percent
County Treasurer Mulliean has re
ceived from the state department of
highways, the pro rata amount due
Jrady county on the tax paid by auto
owners of the county the past year.
The amount thus transferred to the
county, !0 per cent of the auto tax
ollected, totals $2,323.20.
From the amount of taxes collected
from owners of autos who are residents
of the city of Chickasha, 2- per cent
of the 90 per cent returned to Grady
county or $20.77, is returnable to the
city.
Under the present highway laws the
amount returned by the state depart
ment of highways is available to the
county to which returned for road-drag
ging purposes, and for the upkeep of
roads already 'built, to be used in any
part of the county upon orders of the
county commissioners.
While the greater part of this money
apportioned to Crady county has been
paid from the territory immediately
contiguous to Chickasha, It has been
apportioned between the three commis
sioners' districts to be used in drag
ging the roads and in the upkeep of the
roads already built.
This work is to be dona by contract.
the commissioners to award the con
tracts. Only one of such contracts
has been thus far awarded. Jess Tay
lor has taken the contract for drag
finf the Chlckasha-Tahler roud, for a
distance of three miles at a price of
$1 per mile for each dragging the
road to be dragged after each rain and
the li'c of the contract to continue
during the pleasure of all parties con
cerned. Sinking Fund Productive.
Grady county now has. invested
through its treasurer. $7j,00 In school
and county warrants, which are paying
an annual interest premium upon the
investment of 6 per cent as against 1
per cent which the same amount would
be drawing on time deposit in any of
the banks.
The amount thus invested comes
from the sinking funds of tho differ
ent school districts throughout tho
county, and tho interest accruing is
apportioned back, to the school funds
of the several school districts. The
interest on the investments is carried
in totals from month to mounth, until
tjie end of the fiscal year. June SO, at
which time the apportionments are
made in proportion to the amounts on
hand to the credit of the districts.
By a careful selection of the war
rants in which the surplus funds are
placed cr invested, Treasurer Mulliean
has no fear of investing in warrants
excess of the amount which wiil
be avail lble to redeem the same when
Ihey become due. Through a careful
systematizing of the number and
amounts purchased from each district
this danger, small at best is entirely
obviated. In evidence or this Mr.
Mullican's books show that every war
rant in which the moneys of tho county
were invested falling due in the year
lit 5, have 'been redeemed by the sev
eral' districts and that the wararnts
now on hands, bought in the above
manner with the county's funds are all
of 1916 issue.
Mr. Mulliean, investing the moneys
from the sinking funds of the several
school districts in this manner adds
$1,!0fl per annum, each year, on every
$75,000 thus invested, over and above
the gross interest amounts which
would accumulate on like amount plac
ed in the different banks on interest at
the regular time deposit rates.
