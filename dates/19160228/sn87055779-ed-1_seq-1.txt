liteTatUmal News Sonlce:
WASHINGTON', Feb. 25. Ger
Tnany today, through Ambassador
nn Bernstorff. formally notified the
Vnited States that there is no such;
thing as a merchantman armed for
defensive purposes. Her position,
very frankly stated at a conference
between the ambassador .and the sec
retary of state, was that armament
of any character is offensive arma
ment so far as merchant vessels nr
oncerned. As a result of the con
ference the submarine situation is
iciterially graver, although there
.till is a possibility that the material
jxdnts of difference will be subject
to further diplomatic negotiations.
The ambassador came to the state
department on an appointment made
at his own request. Previously he
bail conferred with Baron Erich
Zwiedinek. the Austrian charge. The
latter had received instructions to
day from Vienna that the orders sent
to the (iprman ambassador were to
govern him in his negotiations with
the United States. As a result the
statement of fount von Eernstorff
represented the joint position of the
Teutonic powers.
Will Keep IToniisOi.
The flennan ambassador very
frankly told Sec'y Lansing that there
could be no reason to assume that
the promises previously made by
(Jorniany that the rules of interna
tional law would be- strictly observed
were not abridged by the determina
tion to sink armed merchantmen on
fight and without warning.
Peaceful ships would have every
protection, he said, but Germany
cannot assume that any armed ves
el. no matter where her guns are
carried, is a peaceful ship. And he
insisted that secret orders of the
British admiralty have absolutely
tbrldsred and nullified the pledge
previously given by Ambassador
Sprlnsr-nice In August, l'H4. that
British merchantmen would not use
their guns except in defense.
The (icrmnn ambassador explained
to Fec'y Irnsing that the imperial
German government believes that the
itftldavits idaced in the possession of
Ambassador Gerard two weeks aeo
which contained the secret orders of
the British admiralty to all merch
ant captains showed that every Brit
ish vessel which carried puiH must
use them if approached by a sub
marine. He also intimated that he!
had information which would show j
that the steamer carrying these ap
pendices to the general German an
nouncement of a new submarine war
against armed ships had been de
tained In "alninv.th for more than
live days and every sack of mail
marched.
This suggestion differed from the
"belief In the state department that
the delay in the receipt of these
most important documents was due
to the fact that they were sent in

BUTTER-CUP BLOOM
FOUND NEAR CITY
Water Heated by Ashes is Held to bo
Cause For Karly
Visitor.
Robin Redbreast will be cheated
out of his job as the tirst harbinger
of spring in South Bend this year.
The position has already been taken
by a little, yellow butter-cup, while
snow still covers the ground our
the greater part of the city.
This little llower was found Sun
day by J. Marvin Stewart and An
drew Winnerling, 4 30 .Sherman av..
poking its head up near a little
stream near the brick yards in the
northwest part of the city. Water
heated by ashes that are dumped
there runs over the ground where
the little Mower is growing and this
is thought to be the cause of its pre
mature appearance.
According to the explanation
given by the men who found the
Mower, the ashes are on fire, due to
spantaneous combustion. There are
a number of springs in the vicinity
and the water is heated as it passes
through the ashes. It runs down to
the little stream on the banks of
which the Mower was found.

International Nenn Service:
LONDON, Feb. 2fc. The death
list in the destruction of the Penin
sular and Oriental liner Maloja,
which was sunk by a mine off Dover,
increased steadily today. Early in
the morning it was known that 40
persons were dead, but at that time
others were missing. At noon seven
more bodies had been found and by
3 o'clock this afternoon the death
toll had mounted to 52, five bodies
having been found and landed at
Dover.
As the ship hit the mine while
traveling along a course which was
thought safe, the general belief in
London is that it was sunk by a
German mine, ?aid by one of the new
Teuton submarines equipped for
that purpose.
The number of rescued from the
destroyed liner totalled 261 at 1 p.
m. today. It was believed that this
would bo increased as several of the
small rescue boats put in at towns
along the coast.
Among the survivors taken into
Dover was a tiny infant which was
found floating on its back. It was
picked up by a British patrol boat
which reached the scene of the dis
aster a few moments after it oc
curred. The baby was taken to the
patrol boat's engine room and wrap
ped In warm clothing. In a short
time it was smiling and "cooin?" at
its rescuers and appeared none the
worse for its experience. The child's
parents are thought to have perished.
Mrs. Mcl.c-od .Missing.
Reports that Mrs. McLeod, wife
of Gen. Mcleod. of the British
army, had been lost, have been con
firmed. All the mails, bagcage and cargo
of the liner were lost.
The first batch of survivors from
the Maloja arrived at Victoria sta
tion early today from Dover bring
ing fresh details of the disaster.
Their stories p:eced together made
the following narrative:
'"The Maloja was making her way
through choppy seas off Dover when
just about 10:30 o'clock she ran
acainst a mine. From the nature of
the explosion the bill .re of the ship
struck the mine rather than the
prow. There was an explosion which
hurled a geyser of water 0 0 feet in
the air and at the s.ome time a gi
gantic hole was torn in the Vhip's
side hcTow the water line.
"When the smoke cleared away it
was soon that the Mirfaco of the
water was covered with wreckage.
Meanwhile the ship was listing so
badly that only a. few of the lifeboats
could be launched.
Holls Completely Over.
"For 20 minutes th-? helpless liner
wallowed on the water and then she
suddenly turned over on her side
and finally rolled completely over
with only the keel visible on the
surface.

More Artillery Fsel,
More artillery is being u d in the
battle at Verdun than in any nthr
engagement which has b'en fought
on the vva-sl. front and the. bombard
ment which began nune than a
vve-ek ai;o, lias been continuous, day
and night.
The heavy snow s'orms which
have been raging for the past few
days, have been of advantage to the'
Germans because the-y pr-ent-d the
artiilerymen from learning the loca
tions of the big guns of the (b-r-mans
u miles behind the tiring line.
Great lb -ets of German aeroplanes
have hovered above the ej-rm,';n
lines, ready to attack and beat o'f
any French air scouts that mi-lit be
seeking the positions f the- German
artillery.
Attack I-ite in Day.
The infantry attaens have invari
ably been carried out late in the day
after many hours f conee r;t ! ated
tire against th- particular positions
the Germans aimed to capture. For
more than a v-lr the Freneh. have
(-n busily ehgagcl in strengthen
ing the fortifications north and ast
of Ve rdun. There v. a n- mile s of
..barbed wire entanglements 17, o 20
j miles deep, great stretches of mined
luround. barricades made with falb p.
; trees, innumerable Lues of trenches
j and hundr'ds of hidden ma him
;g;;n emplacements. It was the work
of the Gr:nan gunners to de-troy
thee ear full;.' made fort:b ations
before the -harg's w re launched
and they sufoe.ded admirably.
Heavy loss .f lif- has he-en inflict
ed upon tli- French, particularly by
the German artilb ry lire, o.q the
other hard, the ;-ri..an los- have
not been out of proportion to the x

vigor of th" German as-aults, al
though as the inner works of the
French have been approached the
attacks have crown f-v in number

PARIS. Feb. 2S Th French
war oi!i e announced this afternoon
that the Germans are being held in
check at Verdun. Efforts of the
kaiser's troops to . apture the forti
fied illage at Douaumont have fail
ed, tho official communique stated.
It admits, however that Fort Douau
mont is closely surrounded.
In conjunction with their offensive
i agaiot Verdun German forces ha.v
also launched fresh attacks in th
Champagne region. The com
munique admits that the lermans
penetrated some advanced line
trenches and a supporting trench
near the Navarin farm, north of Sou
v ain.
International News Service:
PARIS. Feb. 2v The French
have been compelled to yield further
grouml to the Germans in the great
battle at Verdun, but heavy rein
forcements have been rushed to thu
tiring line and heavy losses are be
ing intlicted upon the attacking
I forces as the-y roll forward against
tiie devastating fire of machine guns
and artilL-ry.
Although the Germans are mak
ing their greatest effort northeast of
Veidun. particularly around Douau
mont, violent lighting is in pr.zress
all along the front from Champneu-
ill" to St. Mihiel. about 5 0 miles
away. A terrific attempt is being
made- by tli- Teutons t break the
! I'reneh lines upon the Woevre plains
and allow them to throw a heavy
force across the Me use at ,t. Mihiel
to cut off Verdun from the south.
The French war othee admits a
withdrawal in that region for strat-
gic reasons, bu: claims that the
fresh attacks of the Germans have
been repulsed.
Both sides are being constantly
reinforced and it is reported, (but
without continuation), that British
troops may be sent to Verdun to
help the French if the situation
tlie-re- li-c!iis any more sericjus.
It is believed, however, that this
may not be necessary, ;iS military
experts declare that the ;erman as
saults have already begun to grow
vveakr and that thet frightful loos
es are having a 5 el t -r ious effect
upon the morale of the tnopv.
Fewer infantry attac ks have been
made by th- Germans and the y have
'"'ii reiving more, up..n th'ir artil
b ry. e n the other hand, the French
have just begun to deliver their
counter attacks in arnst and
mikrhty clrive-s are be-ing madj
auair.st the German positions.
