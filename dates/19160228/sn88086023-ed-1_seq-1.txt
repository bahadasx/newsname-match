ORATORICAL CONTEST TO BE
Nation Must Guide by Principle,
Not Expediency, Says
President Wilson
(From President Wilson's speech at the Gridiron banquet
Saturday.)
"Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has been a g. . ai deal
about candidacy for the presidency. It is not a new feel
ing on my part, but one which I entertain with a greater
intensity than formerly, that a man who seeks the presi
dency of the United States for anything that it will bring
to him is an audacious fool. The responsibilities of the
office ought to sober a man even before he approaches it.
One of the difficulties of the office seldom appreciated, I
dare say, is that it is difficult to think while so many peo
ple are talking, and particularly while so many people are
talking in a way that obscures counsel and is entirely off
the point.
"The point in national affairs, gentlemen, never lies
along the lines of expediency. It always rests in the field
of principle. The United States was not founded upon any
principle of expediency; it was founded upon a profound
principle of human liberty and of justice, and whenever
it bases ita policy upon any other foundation than those,
it builds on the sand and not upon the solid rock.
"America ought to keep out of this war. She ought to
keep out of this war at the sacrifice of every thing except
the single thing upon which her character and history are
founded, her sense of humanity and justice. If she sacri
fices that, she has ceased to be America; she has ceased
id entertain and to love the traditions which have made us
proud to be Americans, and when we go about seeking
safety at the expense of humanity then I, for one, will be
lieve that I have always been mistaken in what I have con
ceived to be the spirit of American history.
"You never can tell your direction except by long
measurements. You cannot establish a line by two posts;
you have got to have three at least to know whether they
are straight with anything, and the longer your line, the
more certain your measurement. There is only one way in
which to determine how the future of the United States is
going to be projected and that is by looking back and see
ing which way the lines ran which led up to the present
moment of power and of opportunity. There is no doubt
about that.
"There is no question what the roll of honor in America
is. The roll of honor consist of the names of men who
have squai ed their conduct by ideals of duty. There is no
one else upon the roster; there is no one else whose name
we t are to remember when we measure things upon a na
tional scale.
"Ami I wish that whenever an impulse of impatience
comes upon us, whenever an impulse to settle a thing
some short way tempts us, we might close the door and
take down some old stories of what American idealists
and statesmen did in the past and not let any counsel in
that does not sound in the authentic voice of American
tradition. Then we shall be certain what the lines of the
future are, because we know we shall be steering by the
lines of the past. We shall know that no temporary con
venience, no temporary expediency, will lead us either to
lie rash or to be cowardly. I would be just as much
ashamed to be rash as I would to be a coward. Valor is
self-respecting. Valor is circumspect. Valor strikes only
when it is right to strike. Valor withholds itself from ail
small implications and entanglements and waits for the
great opportunity, when the sword will flash as if it car
ried the light of Heaven upon its blade."
