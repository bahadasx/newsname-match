DEFENSIVE ARMS '
REALLY QFFENSIVE
Germany Claims Submarines
Have Been Attached By
British Ships. '
WASHINGTON. D. C. Feb. 28.
In a note presented to secre
tary of state Lansing today by
count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, Germany assures the United
States that it has no intention of re
voking the pledges given In the Lusl
tania case.
The note says Germans can conceive
no reason for changing or postponing
the new instructions to her submarlno
commanders to treat as warships
enemy mdrchant ships armed "defen
sively" and that special precautions
have been taken to prevent ships that
are not armed from being attacked.
The note at the "outset reiterated
.the previous pledges, which were glTen
on September 1 and October 5. last
yeajfw. e the safety of unresisting
liners and then goes; on- to say the
German government does riot believe
those assurances hare been modified
by the new memorandum.'
During the negotiations over the
Lusltanfa case, it says, no mention was
made of armed merchantmen and the
United States, In one of the notes on
the Lusltanla, mentioned unarmed
merchantmen. Attention then Is called
to the assurances privately given In
which it Is stated that the liners will
not be sunk without warning, provided
they do not offer resistance. Attention
also Is called to the statement of the
American government In Its note to
port authorities that the presence of
armament on a merchant vessel creates
the presumption that the vessel is
armed fpr offence.
Can't IVnrn Armed Ships.
It Is stat&l that a submarine com
mander cannot be expected to warn
an enemy merchantman which has a
right to fire on the submarine which
warns It and the German government
sets up the contention that equipment
to resist and intention to resist a
warning given by a submarine do not
come within the definition of defensive
armament.
Germany contends that a similar
viewpoint was taken by the United
States and that It secured assurance
from the Italian government that its
merchant ships leaving American ports
would not fire on submarines which
warned them.
Cites Confidential Order.
The note then sets forth that the Ger
man government did not issue Its new
Instructions to submarine commanders
until after It had come Into possession
of confidential instructions by the Brit
ish government to the commanaers oi
Brltth merchantmen to attack subma
rines
It is denied that armed merchant
ships of any description are peaceful
traders, and It Js doclared that the arm
ament on board all of them Is to be
used especially for purposes of attack.
Ships AttncK suuniBrmes.
Tho rbarire is made that Austrian
xtihmnrlnea also have been attacked by
armed British merchantmen, which the
note declares arc not conforming and
have no Intention of conforming to the
assurance!, given to the United States
by the British government in a memo

Three Arrested on Charges
of Recruiting Soldiers
For the British.
Honolulu, T. H.. Feb. 28. W. R. Sellg

Jefferson, charged with recruiting
American soldiers for service In the
British army, were taken Sunday be
fore United tSates commissioner George

cognizance. ISO Recruits .Secured.
From documents found on the per
sons of the men arrested and In Itan
dall's trunk, it was learned that 156 re
cruits had been secured and that 154 of
them had gone to the front. Two oth
ers were awaiting the arrival of the
steamer Niagara from Australia for
British Columbia.
Kellirsen was charged with being the

of people prominent in Honolulu life.
Moit rtecrults Were Soldiers.
Most of the recruits had seen service.
The majority of them were discharged
American soldiers who had purchased
their discharge with the help of the al
leged conspirators, it was said.
Seligsen was said to have furnished
the soldiers with letters offering em
ployment, as required by the army reg
ulations, and to have furnished the
funds for the purchase of discharges.
Randall, It Is said, told commissioner
Curry all he knew about the plot, and
It was on Information furnished by
Randall that the authorities based their
nredictlon of other important arrests.

see how the American government. Id
consideration of these facts, can re
gard armed British merchantmen as
peaceful trading ships.
Accord With V. S. Vle-v.
The note makes It clear that the Ber
lin government believes Its new In
structions to submarine commanders
are In accord with the viewpoint ex
pressed by the United States In Its
memorandum proposing a modus Vi
vendi to the entente allies for the dis
armament of merchant ships.
It declares that German submarine
commanders have been so Instructed
that they will not destroy a merchant
ship on a question of armament unless
It Is known positively that such arma
ment exists.
ThS efforts of the United States to
have the belligerents agreed to a modus
Vivendi which would cause all mer
chant ships to be disarmed. It Is de
clared, are welcomed by Germany.
Then follows a declaration that the
German government will no longer al
low Its submarines to be made the
object of attacks in violation of tho
principles of International law and
that, therefore, the new Instructions
will not be postponed or modified.
0 Attacks Specified.
Appended to the communication,
which was signed by count von Bern
storff, was a list of about 20 Incidents
where It Is charged German and Aus
trian submarines have been attacked
by merchantmen armed ostensibly for
defensive purposes
At no place in the communication Is
it suggested that American citizens
be warned to remain off armed mer
chant ships and the question of what
constitutes defensive armament Is not
brought up, although it Is admitted In
various quarters that such a question
probably will be raised
Antrin SecondN GrrmilnyV VleiTM.
Baron Zweldlnek, charge of the Aus
trian embassy, called upon secretary of
state Lansing afler count von Bern
storff had left and Informed him that
Germany's views, as set forth In the
note from count von Bernstorff were
Identical with those of his government
and that Austria, in effect, seconded
everything contained in the German
communication.
Secretary Lansing is understood to
have advised neither 'of the Teutonic
diplomats what the views of the United
States would be toward the communi
cation. Cnbiuet Will rnnxldrr Note.
It was understood that the note
would be brought to the attention of
president Wilson tonight and that
nothing definite regarding It would be
decided until after It had been sub

GERMANS SAY AIR ATTACK
HEAVILY DAMAGED ENGLAND
Berlin. Germany. Feb. 28. Heavy
damage was suffered in England by
reason of the German aerial attack of
Jan. 31-Feb. 1, according to the Over
seas News agency, basing its statement
on the reports of "competent German
sources In Liverpool." The reports say
a large number of bridges and docks
were seriously damaged., as likewise
were several ships in the Mersey,
among them a cruiser anchored at
Birkenhead and a transport of the Ley
land line. A stable with 200 horses is
Bald to have been destroyed by fire and
the horses and their Canadian guards
to have perished.
The item says that more than 200
houses were destroyed by bombs and
fire.
At Manchester, two ironworks ,were
completely destroyed and others dam
aged, while at Sheffield a blast furnace
was almost completely destroyed. At
Nottingham, an ammunition factory and
other factories were badly damaged.
The loss in Sheffield and Nottingham is
apprrtlsed at as high as 400.000 by ;
the London insurance companies, ac- j
cording to the story.
THE great battle of Verdun,
now entering its second week,
is continuing with unabated
fury, with the German armies driv
ing hard at the French defences
along the lengthening line which
now runs far beyond the salient in
which lies the fortress.
Paris says that with the pouring
in of heavy reinforcements for Gen.
Joffre's armies, the 'German ad
vance haB been checked, but Berlin
claims the- continuation of the for
ward march on the Frenon strong
hold. French Are Stiffening
Along the Meuse north of Verdun,
the Germans have been unable to
make as rapid progress as in the
initial stages of the battle, and
even on the Woevre front, where
the French first fell back, they
now appear to be offering resist
ance. The French defensive opera
tions at places are taking on the
nature of a counter offensive.
French Regain Advantage
According to l statement by
Arlstlde Briand. the French pre
mier, the French, after the fourth
day of battle, brought up strong
reinforcements at an unexpected
moment and the Infantry, sweep
ing down upon the Germans, who
already were suffering heavily
from the effects of the French ar
tillery fire, stopped them short
and even drove them back. The
premier declares the .French have
now regained the advantage, the
beginning of their counter at
tacks marking the turning point
of the battle which is now In its
second phase.

LONDON. Eng., Feb. 28. Berlin re
ports of today would Indicate that
the German rush to Verdun fort
ress, temporarily blocked at Douau
mont Tillage by Frenoh reserves, has
?gain swept forward, though the
French reports by no means concede
this.
According to Berlin, attempts by th.
French, to retake the fortress of Dou
aumont have not only failed, but th
German advance on Verdun continues
steadily. In rapid succession. Louve

In the plain of the Woevre the Ger

French Hold . Firm. Is Claim.
So far as the French report of thu
afternoon shows, the French lines tn
the immediate vicinity of Verdun are
holding firm. The German attack is
developing along the front east and
southeast.
At Fort Douaumont. wh-Te the flight
ing has been heaviest, the situation is
unchanged, says Paris. The fortress
Itself apparently Is still held by the
Germans. In the village of Douau
mont, a few hundred yards from the
fort, there was a furious struggle Sun
day night. The war office announces
that German attempts to capture the
village resulted In failure.
Southwest of Verdun, over the line
bending south to St. Mlhlel. the Ger
mans are pressing the attack. The
French statement reports a futile Ger
man attack against Manheulles, ten
miles southeast of Verdun, which may
Indicate an advance in that quarter,
although the precise location of the
front In this sector has not been mads
known.
Germans $clxe Mile or Trenches.
Not only is the Impetus of the Ger
man drive on Verdun toeing pressed
vigorously, although with less rapid
progress by the crown prince's armies,
but aggressive action on a large scale
has developed In the Champagne dis
trict. wTiere the Germans, according to
Berlin, have stormed and captured
nearly a mile or French trenches and
nave taken more than 1000 prisoners.
The- new movement in the Champagne
district is on a front much nearer
Paris than the scene of the operations
against Verdun, the former front be
Infc approximately 100 miles from Paris,
while the Verdun fighting area is,
roughly. 140 miles distant
More than 600,000 men are engaged
in the Verdun sector. It Is apparent
that the French have brought up verv
heavy reserves of men and guns with
which to turn the tide of battle.
