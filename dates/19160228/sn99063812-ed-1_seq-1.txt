Any Future Accident to Americana,

Austria's Position Ih Same.
By CAUL ACKKKMAX
(United Pres; Staff Correspondent)
nrriMX, Feb. 28. Tho United
Press was reliably Informed today
that Teuton submarines will not tor
pedo passenger liners without warn
ing, even after the armed merchant
men decree takes effect Wednesday.
Submarines will endanger humans
only If a steamer attempts to escape,
to fire upon or ram a submarine.
If future accidents endanger
Americans, Germany does not con
sider she is responsible.
President Wilson's letter to Sen
ator Stone regarding the decree and
tho president's stand created a sen
sation here. Officials admit that they
believe America's attitude unfriend
ly In pending negotiations.
"We do not .know what Wilson
means when he refers to German vio
lation of international law," said ono
high official. "Surely he has not re
ceived any of the proofs we sent show
ing that the allies first violated In
ternational law."
The German-American situation is
considered serious here.

The charge of wanton injury to

Prosecuting Attorney John Irwin.
United Pre" Service
WASHINGTON. Fob. 28. German
Ambassador von Bernstorff at noon
today gave State Secretary Lansing
memorandum reiterating Germany's
expressed intention of torpedoing
armed merchantmen without warning
after tomorrow.
Neither Bernstorff nor Lansing will
discuss the matter today.
It was later learned that the mem
oranda also contained reports sworn
to by Teutonic submarine command
ers detailing a score of cases wherein
it is alleged that British merchantmen
crews used their guns offensively
against submarines.
Austria's position in the matter Is
identical with Germany's. This In
formation was officially conveyed to
Lansing this afternoon by Austrian
Charge do Affaires Zweldfnek.
This followed the presentation of an
agreement, drawn up by an organi
zation of the Russian colonists,
whereby the horses tho defendants
are alleged to have poisoned were
to bo paid for and the case settled
out of court.
There has been considerable quar
reling of late among these colonists,
but prominent members of the col
ony say the agreement will bring
about better feeling.
