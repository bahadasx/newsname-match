GERMANY'S ATTITUDE ON
ARMED MERCHANTMEN.
Claim Is Made That Such Ships Are
Subject to Destruction Without
Warning.
Washington, Feb. 27. Germany has
Instructed Count Von Bernstorft to In
form "the United States government
that the assurances regarding the fu
ture conduct of submarine warfare,
given in the Lusitania and Arabic
cases, still are binding, but that they
apply only to merchantment of a
peaceful character. The German gov
ernment is understood to contend that
armed merchantmen, without regard
to the nature of their armament, have
shown themselves not to be peaceful
and therefore are subect to destruc
tion without warning.
The instructions direct the German
ambassador particularly to tell Sec
retary Lansing that British merchant
men, armed ostensibly only for de
fense, have not assumed the character
of peaceful traders, but that on the
contrary they are carrying guns for
the special purpose of attacking Ger
man submarines. To support this
claim the Berlin foreign office has sent
the ambassador for presentation to the
state department a list of at least
twenty incidents where it is claimed
British merchant ships have attacked
submarines.
Confidential advices received from
Berlin state that German and Austrian
submarine commanders already have
been given their new orders and that
from midnight Tuesday they will be
authorized to sink without warning all
armed merchant ships of the enemies
of Germany. It was said also that
many of the submarine commanders
probably had left their bases on voy
ages and that ever should the United
States request the postponing of the
opeuning of the campaign it would be
imposssib'' to get word to many of the
submarines.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
GERMAN PUBLISHERS
Formation of a German News Agency
in Washington Discussed.
Chicago, Feb. 27. The National As
sociation of German Publishers was
organized here today by Paul F.
Mueller, of the "Abendpost", Chicago,
as president. Fifty publishers from
leading cities of the country were
present.
The meeting, the first session of
which was held yesterday, concerned
itself only with business questions, ac
cording to Mr. Mueller. Former Con
gressman Bartholdt of St. Louis was
among those present.
"Politics received little attention and
that informally," said Mr. Barthold.
"Of course it is understood, that Ger
mans generally are not -pleased with
President Wilson's idea of neutrality,
nor do they like Colonel Roosevelt,
but the organization was not formed
with any idea of concerted political
action. The Germans don't want a
pro-German president, nor a pro-British,
but they do want a pro-American
president."
The principal subjects discussed to
day were labor and the question of a
German news gathering and distribut
ing agency at Washington.
The matter of a news bureau was
left to a committee to investigate as
to expense and feasibility. The labor
question chiefly involves the difficul
ty in the smaller cities of obtaining
German printers.

FORECAST OF WORK
IN CONGRESS THIS WEEK.
Legislative Business Will Be Resumed
in Regular Order.
Washington, Feb. 27. Legilative bus
iness will be resumed in regular order
at the capitol this week after the re
cent flurry over international affairs
that demoralized the work of congress.
In both houses administration leaders
have held in control the threatened
revolt against the president on the
armed ship issue and no further out
burst is expected unless there should
be a development apparently leading
lowara war.
Leaders of agitation to warn Ameri
cans oft belligerent merchantmen car
rying arms admit that there is no
chance to get legislation on . the sub
ject. Senator Gore, author of the
warning resolution in the senate, has
publicly declared that there is no de
sire to stay the hand of the president
in diplomatic negotiations. He also
says the real purpose of his resolution
already had been accomplished and
this is regarded by administration
leaders virtually as an abandonment of
the effort to force a vote on the issue
in either house.
Conservation champions in the sen
ate plan to throw their combined
strength against the Shields bill to
provide for leasing of water power
sites on navigable waters to private
Interests.
Tomorrow Senator Husting of Wis
consin, who has had co-operation of
other senators, will propose a substi
tute to the Shields bill, with regula
tory features, which he declares will
safeguard the public interest and pre
vent monopolization of water power
facilities. Test votes so far on amend
ments have indicated that the Shields
bill has a strong following.
At the first opportunity Senator Rob
inson of Arkansas will endeavor to
have passed his resolution providing
for an inquiry into the aviation ser
vice of the army, against which he
has filed serious charges of inefficiency.
The Arkansas senator declared tonight
he would insist upon a vote within a
few days.
NEARLY 6,000,000 JEWS
RUINED BY THE WAR.
Many of Them Are Dependent on the
Good Will of Their Brethren.
New York, Feb. 27. General immi
gration to the United States after the
war is improbable, according to reports
made to President Leon Sanders of the
Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant so
ciety of Ameica, and made public by
him at its annual meeting here today.
"It may be otherwise with the Jews,
however," Mr. Sanders said, "owing to
the especially unfortunate situation
which the war has created for them.
Nearly 6,000,000 Jews are ruined, in
the greatest moral and material mis
ery, mony of them are refugees, de
pendent on the good will of their
brethren."
The society is directing its attention,
hr- -ported, to the problem of distrib
uting immigrants In the western states
so that immigration will not be con
centrated in the east but will flow nor
mally to the less densely populated
districts of the west. The society is
in communication with chambers of
commence and other important com
mercial bodies throughout the country,
many of which have expressed their
willingness to aid Jewish immigrants.
Immigration on the Pacific coast has
become unusually heavy, according to
the report. Many refugees who made
long journeys from Russia through Si
beria and Manchuria have arrived at
San Francisco and Seattle.

PRESIDENT WILSON GRIDiON GUEST
Address Was Confidential. But Was Made Public at
Request of Members
SAYS AMERICA SHOULD
President Spoke of the Nation's Affairs With Unusual Gravity
More Interested in What the People Are Talking About
Around Quiet Firesides Than What They Are Talking
About in the Cloak Rooms of Congress Dwelt Upon
the Responsibility of Office Declares the Country Was
Founded Upon a Profound Principle of Human Liberty
and of Humanity and That Those Principles Must be
Sustained.
Washington. Feb. 27. President
Wilson told members and guests at a
Gridiron club dinner last night that
America ought to keep out of the Eu
ropean war at the sacrifice of every
thing except this single thing upon
which her character and her history
are founded, her sense of humanity
and justice.
The address was confidential, since
the speeches at the dinners of the
Gridiron Club, composed of newspaper
correspondents, are not reported. It
was made public tonight, however,
with the consent of the president and
the club because many of those who
heard it urged that it should go to the
country.
. Spoke With Unusuaj Gravity.
The president spoke of the nation's
affairs with unusual gravity. His
hearers, including several hundred
members of government departments,
business men and correspondents,
were brought to their feet cheering
when he concluded with these words:
Says Valor is Circumspect.
"I would be just as much ashamed
to be rash as I would to be a coward.
Valor is self-respecting. Valor Is cir
cumspect. Valor strikes only when it
is right to strike. Valor withholds it
self from all small Implications and
entanglements and waits for the great
opportunity when the sword will flash
as if it carried the light of Heaven
upon its blade."
President Wilson's Address.
The address follows: ,
' "I have very litle to say tonight ex
cept to express my warm appreciation
of the invariable courtesy of this club
and of the reception you have so gen
erously accordd-me. I find that I am
seldom tempted to say anything now
adays unless somebody starts some
thing and tonight nobody has started
anything.
Responsibilities of Office.
"Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has
been a great deal about candidacy for
the presidency. It is not a new feel
ing on my part but one which I en
tertain with a greater intensity than
formerly that a man who seeks the
presidency of the United States for
anything that it will bring to him is
an audacious fool. The responsibilities
of the office ought to sober a man even
before he approaches it. One of the
difficulties of the office seldom ap
preciated, I dare say, is that it is very
difficult to think while so many peo
ple are talking and particularly while
so many people are talking in a way
that obscures counsel and is entirely
off the point.
Principle of Human Liberty.
"The point in national affairs, gen
tlemen never lies along the lines of
expediency. It always rests in the
field of principle. The United States
was not founded upon any principle
of expediency; it was founded upon a
profound principle of human liberty
and of humanity and whenever it
bases its policy upon any other foun
dations than those it builds on the
sand and not upon solid rock. It
seems to me that the most enlighten
ing thing a man can do is suggested by
something which the vice president
said tonight. He complained that he
found men who, when their attention
was called to the signs of spring, did
not see the blue heaven, did not see
the movement of the free clouds, did
not think of the great spaces of the
quiet continent, but thought only Of
some immediate and pressing piece of
business.
Would Like to Hear Talk of the
People.
"It seems to me that if you do net
think of the things that lie beyond
and away from and disconnected from
this scene which if we attempt to
think and conclude, you will inevitably
be led astray. I would a great deal
rather know what they are talking
about around quiet firesides all over
this country, than what they are talk
ing about in the cloak rooms of con
gress. I would a deal rather know
what the men on the trains and by
the waysides and in the shops and
on the farms are thinking about and
yearning for, than hear any of the
vociferous proclamations of policy
which it is so easy to hear ana so
easy to read by picking up any scrap
of printed paper. There is only one
wav to hear these things and that is
constantly to go back to the foun
tains of American action. Those foun
tains are not to be found in any re
cently discovered sources.
Justice Founded en Humanity.
"Senator Harding was saying Just
now that we ought to try when we
are a hundred million strong to act in
the same simplicity of principle that
our forefathers acted in when we were
three million strong. I heard some
body say I do not know the exact sta
tistics, that the present population of
the United States is one hundred and
three millions. If there are three
million thinking the same things that
that original three million thought,
the hundred million will be saved for
an illustrious future. ' They were
ready to stake everything for an idea
and that idea was not expediency, but
justice. And the infinite difficulty of
public affairs, gentlemen, is not to dis.
cover the" signs of the heaven and the
directions of the wind, but to square
the things you do by the not simple
but complicated standards of justice.
Justice has nothing to do with expe
diency. Justice has nothing to do with
the temporary standard whatever. It
is rooted and grounded in the funda
mental instincts of humanity.
Ought te Keep Out of War.
"America ouaht to keep out of this
KEEP OUT OF WAR
war. She ought to keep out of this .
war at the sacrifice of everything ex
cept this single thing upon which her
character end history are founded, her
sense of humanity and justice. If
she sacrifices that she has ceased to
be America she has ceased to enter
tain and to love the traditions which
have made us proud to be Americans -and
when we go about seeking safety
at the expense of humanity then I -for
one will believe that I have al- '
ways been mistaken in what I have
conceived to be the spirit of American
history.
Look Backward.
"You never can toll your direction
except by long measurements. You -cannot
establish a line by two posts, '
you have got to have three at least to
know whether they are straight with
anything and the longer your line,
the more certain your measurement.
There is only one way in which to
determine how the future of the Unit
ed States is going to be projected and
that is by looking back and seeing
which way the lines ran which led '
up to the present moment of powel
and of opportunity. There is no doubt
that. There is no question where the
roll of honor in America is. .
Roll of Honor.
"The roll of honor consists of the
names of the men who have squared
their conduct by ideals of duty. There
is no one else on the roster, there is
no one else whose name we care to
remember when we measure things
upon a national seal.- And I wish that
whenever an impulse of impatience
comes upon us, whenever an inclina
tion to settle a thing some short way,
we might close the door and take
down some old stories of what Amcr .
lean idealists and statesmen did ia
the past and not let any counsel In
that does not sound in the authentic -voice
of American tradition. Then
we shall be certain what the Hnes of
the future are, because we shall know
we are steering by th elines of ths
past. We shall know that no tempor-;
ary convenience, no temporary expe-'
diency, will lead us either to be rash
or to be cowardly. I would be Just
as much ashamed to be rash as I
would to be a coward. Valor itself Is
respect. Valor is circumspect. Valor
strikes only when it is right to strike.'
Valor withholds itself from all small
implications and entanglements and
awaits for the great opportunity when
the sword will flash as if it . carried
the light of Heaven upon its blade."
FORMATION OF NATIONAL
HOUSEWIVES' LEAGUE
By Prominent Women Representing
All Parts of the Country.
New York. Feb. 27. Prominent
women representing all parts of the
country have been appointed members
of a special committee to organize the
campaign undertaken by the National
Housewives' League to build up the
health of the nation- through proper
feeding as its contribution to the pre
paredness movement, it was an
nounced here tonight. The committee
is charged with the duty of arousing
women to the need of studying ths
question of nutrition and apay?ng the
knowledge obtained to the members
of their own families. 2very woman's
organization in the country will . bo-,
urged to take up the propaganda.
"If we are ever to have a war we
cannot fight with anemics and dys
peptics," says a statement issued by
the league. "If we are to have a vol-
unteer reserve army made up of bus-'
Iness and professional men, we must
look to the physical upbuilding of
these men. Regular army men are
fed by the plain diet of the commis-t
sary department, whereas volunteers
suddenly springing to arms come from'
the dining rooms and food of the
homes."
