STAND BY ALDERMEN
WHO STAND BY YOU
Cochran Says That's the Real Issue Before Voters in
Tomorrow's Primary Get by the Bunk and
Piffle and Get at the Truth.
BY N. D. COCHRAN
Strip the primary campaign of all
its petty politics, bunk and piffle, and
the real issue before the people is
whether they will stand by the alder
mn who stand by the people and pro
tect the pubic interest, or whether
they will feed honest representatives
to the political wolves.
Alderman Ray puts it this way: "I
don't need the job, but I do want to
find out if the people really want rep
resentatives in council who will hon-
stly strive, to do what thejgeonlg
want them to do. If the people ilon't
want that kind of representation,
then I don't want to be an alderman."
Prom time to time the people de-
mand certain action from their rep
resentatives in council Some alder
men heed that demand; others ignore
it And the thing for voters to do 4
to stand by the honest aldermen wc
obey the will of the people.
It makes no difference what party
an alderman belongs to, what faction
of a party, what church or other or-
