NEW NOTE FROM GERMANY
f Associated Press by Tederal Wireless!
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28 In
a note wntcn Amoassaaor von eern
torff of Germany today presented to
Secretary of State Lansing, Germany
assures the United States that the im
perial government has no intention o
revoking any of the pledges given in
the Lusitania case. The ncte says
that Germany does not'eonsider, that
there is any reason for changing or
postponing the new instructions to
submarine commanders. These new
Instructions are to treat as warships
enemy merchantmen armed defensive
ly, but the note also says that ape
cial precautions are. imposed on the
submarine commanders to prevent at
tack upon unarmed ships.
GERMANY EXPLAINS STAND
In connection with the note from
Germany mentioned above, official
German cablegrams receiyed last night
and today give the German statement
In fuller detail: It Is as follows: -
"The Norddeutsche Allocmeine Zei
tung reprints President Wilson's let
ter to Senator Stone as published by
ReuterV office. The , Norddeutsche
then adds the followingofflcial'state-
ment:
"The principles stated in the Ger
man memorandum are by no means
contrary to international law. For se
cret orders of the English navy pub
lished in memorandum expressly in
struct armed English merchantmen
not only to defend themselves but also
to attack. Numerous- Incidents quoted
in the memorandum give further
proof that ships follow this instruc
tion. Such ships, however, according
ito International law cease to be peace
ful trading ships. ; : :
;" 'On the other hand, the-; attitude
adopted by our enemies appears as a
gross breach of the law of nations.
They commit acts of warfare with
merchantmen for which only real men-
of-war are Qualified. : "
"If President WllsonV letter to
Senator Stone says that announced
measures against armed hostile mer
chantmen are contrary to the express
assurances given by the German and
Austro-Hungarian government to the
United . States, this is apparently
caused by a misunderstanding. . For
these concessions are only in regard
to peaceful passenger 'ships and not
such-ships whose armament is con
nected with aggressive purposes.
"'This misunderstanding is appar
ently caused by the fact that the mem
orandum together with its annexed
notes, is not yet In the hands of the
American government, and that Presi
dent Wilson therefore could . not yet
