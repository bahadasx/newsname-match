London. Feb. 28. The preat
battle of Verdun now entering
its second week, is continuing
with unabated fury, with the
German armies driving hard at
the French defense. Paris as
serts the German advance ha3
been checked but Berlin claims
a continuation of the march on
the French stronghold. Along
the Meuse north of Verdun, the
Germans have been unable to
make as rapid progress as in the
initial stages of the battle and
even on the Woevre front where
the French at first fell back,
they now appear to be offering
effective resistance. -
The French defensive operations at
places arc taking on the nature of a
counter offensive, as in the attacks on
Fort Douauni nt. four miles northeast
of Verdun. This development '.ias

told of the expectation in Paris that
the French when they had fallen back

Mr. Foster, who is a Rhodes schol

From his letter, it appears that he

EPIDEMIC IN KANSAS
Improper IMagnosi Causes Spread of
Scarlet Fever.
Kansas is suffering from an epi
demic of scarlet fever, according to
a statement today by Dr. .1. J. Sippey
of the state board of health. Reports
of 281 cases were received during Jan
uary and it is probable that the Feb
ruary returns will show an increase.
The disease is prevalent in about sixty
counties.
While a number of deaths have
been reported, the death rate has not
been high. Dr. Sippey stated. Trou
ble in many towns and counties re
sulted from an improper diagnosis of
the disease. As a result of the trou
ble attachees of the state department
have made numerous trips over the
state. At this time conditions are not
regarded as serious in any particular
locality.
"Most of the cases are in a mild
form," said Dr. Sippey. "The num
ber of cases in the state show an un
usual total, although the death rate
has been comparatively low. In ad
dition to the reports of scarlet fever
cases, many reports of smallpox and
measles have been received."
