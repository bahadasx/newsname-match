What Dairymen Should
Do Is to Modernize
Their Delivery System
Dairymen supplying Tacoma with milk have
been obliged in the last year to replace hundreds
of tubercular cows with healthy animals.
Other improvements were made necessary
in order to keep these healthy cows healthy.
All of which meant expense.
0
Now it is proposed to raise milk prices.
WRONG! DEAD WRONG!
But the dairymen's association CAN do
something to give greater profits to the
dairymen.
It can work out an economical and efficient delivery system.
As it is now, dozens of wagons are sent l>y the rival milk men over
the same territory.
Every nig.apartment house, for example, is visited hy a procession
of bottle carriers every day.
If the dairymen's association, which wishes to increase the earn
ings of its members, will .just work out a system of co-operative deliver
ies, so that one wagon and one man will do the work now accomplished by
six wagons and six men —a problem that ought not to be insurmountable
—it will be accomplishing a big, real public service.
It will be saving money for its patrons,
it will be eliminating a lot of waste and use
less traffic, and it will be increasing the pro
fits of its members more than it can hope
to do by any advance in the price of milk
which it can make stick.

! Despite the continued reports
of the appearance of the Spana

are inclined to believe that he ex

women and children.
Deputies Stenso and Chilberg
base this belief on the fact that
the rumors pop up from so many
different sections at the same
time.
Following the attack on Mrs.
Franklin on Feb. 94, the man is
said to have been seen 1n no less
than a dozen places. Mrs. Frank

her buggy and asked for a ride.
She beat him over the bead with
the butt end of her whip.

Her description indicated a
livid scar on the man's face. He
wore working clothes and was
young.
Others who claim to have seen
him claim he wore a collar and
fairly good clothes, leading the
people to believe that he has sev
