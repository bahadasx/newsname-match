ANSWERS GERARD'S
PRISONjCRITICISlfS
Prussian War Minister Replies to
Statements Made About Camps
by Envoys.
DISTORTED BY ENGLISH PRESS
BERLIN (Via London). Feb. 27.
The Prussian war minister today
handed to James W. Gerard, the
American ambassador to Germany, a
loos communication, in which courte
ous, reply la made to the ambassa
dor's fejport of November 8,. regard
ing the Wittenberg prison carrip,
German high military authorities
were astonished, the reply says, when
they aaw portions of the ambassa
dor'a report printed In distorted form
ir the English papers'. ' It declares
that Mr. Gerard had communicated
his criticisms to the Prussian war
ministry through John B. Jackson,
who investigated prison camp condi
tions for the embassy.
Mr. Gerard, It is said, received as
surance that the conditions criticised
would be remedied, whereupon Mr.
Jackson said he was convinced the
ambassador would be satisfied with
this promise.
Not Received by Commander.
The communication refers to Mr.
Gerard's statement, which wss "obvt
oualy made in a reproachful sense," that
when he visited the Wtttenburg camp be
was not received by the camp com
mander.
The ueriran military authorities are
fully aware of the consideration due the
ambassr.dor because of his position," the
reply says, adding the explanation that
the commander of the camp was com'
pelled by military duties to be absent on
the day of the visit of the ambassador.
The communication points out that Mr.
Gerard reported the accommodations snd
fare of the prisoners were the same as
those In other camps. Rnglish press re
ports, based on the ambassador's alleged
statements, reported conditions st Wit
tenberg as extraordinarily unsatisfac
tory. It Is admitted that police dogs are used
at Wittenberg, but it is said they are
employed for guard duty at night and
also to prevent theft, among prisoners.
As to the ambassador's report that In
certain cases prisoner, complained their
clothes had been torn b l)e dogs, the
ministry says that if tls be trus the
victims themselves were leeponsible since
they were surprised at night at forbidden
games, ran when challenged by the sen
try snd climbed the barbed wire fence.
Refers t Report.
Reply Is made to Mr. Gerard's criticism
of sanitary conditions by referring to the
report of a commission of American phy
sk'lsns under Dr. Caldwell which Investi
gated the camp on November 20 and
praised Its sanitary and hygienic equip,
ment.
Ambassador Gerard's statement that a
British army surgeon had been beaten
by a German noncommissioned of flier
was Investigated by the ministry of war,
wnUh discovered that a regrettable mis
understanding bad occurred, the Gorman
officer having exceeded his power. The
English surgeon in question has declared
that the matter has been adjusted satis
factorily. In reference to Mr. Gerard's statement
that prisoners had complained that pay
due them for work was unpaid. It Is uo
dei.tood tho ambatsador told the offUwr
who Is conducting him through the r.mo
of this complaint.

Around Verdun.
CONFIDENCE IN THE RESULT
People Believe Germans Will Wear

WHOLE FRONT ON THE ALERT
PAItlS. Feb. 27. Paris Is extra
ordinarily calm in the prespnre of
the great battle now In progress
around Verdun. There are no indi
cations of tension or nervousness, but
only sober confidence in the result
prevails.
The desire among those who know
the defensive strength of the lines
seems to be that the attacks should
continue, for, thry argue, the losses
on the German side would be in pro
portion to their efforts.
There were few persona around
the newspaper bulletin boards today,
and no crowds at the ministry of war
and other public offices. The whole
front from the North Bea to Switzer
land is on the alert, and all leaves of
absence hare been recalled.
Mulmna Kffort Made.
The French maximum effort has not
yet been msde. The total French losses
In killed, wounded, and prisoners, since
the Verdun battle, it was authoritatively
st r ted this evening, has been lees than
the German official communication
claims In prisoners.
The Temps military reivlew, which Is
u.uslly written by General de la Croix,
sums up the situation thus:
"The battle being fought Is sxtremely
serious. Even should the heights of
Polvre and the Vauche be taken, the
enemy would find us perhaps stronger
on the Froldeterre-Dousumont line, from
which begins the defenses, properly
speaking, of the fortress, covered with
trenches snd batteries. Tl.ls la a siege
by the Germans; It is a battle against
one of our armies In the garrison at Ver
dun, and Its forts do not figure In these
eomhata ss a support. Tha big guns of
ths enemy might destroy the fort of
pousamont VTtlNjuV. destroying Anything
more than an inert block of Cement.".
. . Caaaat Be Sn.nended,
The snow has not caused any diminu
tion uf the attacks because they cannot
be suspended. ' They must be continued
to the end. The t ror pa engsged would
be unable to remain Idle long In the terri
tory captured while awaiting better
weather conditions. A thaw would ren-
der their situation worse and It must al
ready be painful."
The Temps refers tn the possibility of
the attacks continuing for two weeks
and adds:
"Lt us continue to have complete and
unahakeable confidence In the final Is
sue."

of General , who Is commanding

youngest and most active French gen
erals, who took an important part In the
battles In Lorraine before and during

Another of the commanding officers
before the battle of Verdun, General
'. during tha battle was In charge
of the artillery of the Sixth corps while
the army of the Gorman crown prince
was making the first attsck on the fort-
res., on this oocsslon a rumor was cir
culated In Berlin that Verdun bad been
taken. The general placed three groups
of three-Inch guns In the Boss woods,
and permitted the German troopa. who
were overwhelming the French Infantry,
to advance until they reached a distance
seven-eighths of a mile. Then the three
groups of field guns opened fire snd
checked the advance. The losses of tha
crown prince's army on that day were
estimated at 20,000.
The names of the three French sen-
erals referred to apparently have been
stricken out by the French censor.

The address waa'confldenttal, aince
the speeches at the dinners of the

night, however, becauio many of
those who heard it urged that it
should go to the country.
Speaks rrlth Gravity.
The president spoke of the nation's
affairs with unusual gravity. His
hearers, including several hundred
members of congress, government of
ficials and correspondents were
brought to their feet cheering when
h concluded with these words:
"I would be Just as much ashamed
to be rash as I would to be a coward.
Valor Is self-respecting. Valor is
circumspect. Valor strike only
when it is right to strike. Vr.'or

WAR PROFITS HARD
i . - i
HIT BY TEUTON TAX
Those Who Make Money Out of War
Must Come Across with it
for Fatherland.
NO ESTIMATES ABE YET MADE
BERLIN, Feb 26 (Via London),
Feb. 37. Germany "a next expected
taxation measures were announced
by the government today. They In
clude taxes upon the war profits of
Individuals and corporations; also in
direct measures of taxation.
No estimated yield on the taxation
of war proflta ia given. Tha govern'
ment, in fact, is unable to estimate
the sum to be derived because a large
number of corporations liave not yet
sent In their reports, and only the
roughest guesses regarding the
financial statug of' Individuals are
possible. ' .
The war profits measure is divided
Into two sections. The section for
Individuals takes the form of a
graduated tax on property Increment
between January 1, 1914 and 1917.
The tax commences with 5 per cent
upon the first 20,000 marks, 6 per
cent upon the next 30,000 marks,
and then rising In successive stages
to 25 per cent on increases over
(00,000 marks.
A direct tai upon Increased Incomes is
avoided largely owing to objections. It la
said, made by Individual atatea of the
emjlre, in which tha Income tax Is re
served, but by tn Incenlous subterfuge
when sn Increase In the smount of prop
erty is sccompanied by a correnpondtngly
'ncrtased Income, mainly, when property
Increment represents hoardings from an
Increased Income, the rate of taxation is
doubled.
It is admitted that this will rebound to
the advantage of lavUh spenders who
live up to the'r war proflta, but It la
aid that this Is unavoidable. In order
to checkmate various devices of tlx
dodgeis, it is provided that gifts to chil
dren and others, and money invested
abroad during the war must be reported
to the authorities.
Individuals who have been putting
away their profits In Jewelry, paintings
snd other articles of art or luxury, which
as personal property heretofore have
escaped taxation, must return them at
t elr purchnee value. As a further mea-
t're against tax dodging., persons movlnj
out In the country or attempting to send
property a tread before the date of tho
col ectlon, may be forced to deposit with
the authorities enough to cover the tax.
A Jail penalty Is provided for offenders.
TLie corporation tsx on wartime profits
