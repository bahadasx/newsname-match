It PARIS. Feb. 2S?So far as the!
French official report of Mondayj
the Oerinan attack is develop- 1
fing to the east and southeast.
At Fourt Douamont, where the
fighting ras been the heaviest, the
situation is unchanged. The fortress
itself Is apparently still held by the
Germans. In the village of Douaumont,
few hundred yards from the
' fnrt, there was a furious struggle
last night.
> The war oflice announces that German
attempts to capture the village |
resulted in failure.
Southeast of Verdun the Gernuins
are pressing the attack. The French;
statement reports a futile German at(;
tack against Manlteulles, ten miles j
south of Verdun, which may indicate!
and advance in that quarter although ;
the precise location of the front in
En these sections has not been made

taking certain large schemes for
West Virginia development in company
with a group of New York flnan- ,
elers. one of the conditions of the |
latter joining In was that Mr. Watson
should keep out of this year's campaign
as a candidate for the United
States Senate.
However, as to going as one of
the Big Four to the St. I.ouis convention
and relieving John T. McOraw I
of the expense, responsibility and
honor of being a actional committeeman
from West Virginia, no such
stipulation was laid down upon the
Fairmont coal baron, and he Is free
to do one or both of those very j
things. Upon the same uninipeach- I
able nnd mpeccnble authority as
aforesaid, the historian is enabled
to set it down as a fact beyond cavil
and question that Mr. Clarence Wayland
Watson's personal political program
for the immediate future embraces
lite following, to-wit:
First: He will go to the national convention
at St. i.ouis as a ntom
her of the Big Four.
Second: He will return from the
national convention at St. Bonis the ,
duly elected member of the national
committee from West Virginia.
That's all for tl.e time being.

weighed 3,100 1-2 pounds, for which
he received from his father $1 a

"There Is no reason why any
bright lnd like young Tllley ennnot
do us well as he did on the same
amount of land," said Congressman
Cooper. Suppose that there was a
potato cluh in each of the fifty-live
counties of the state this year composed
of 100 members to a county,
and these 5,500 boys would grow a
crop approximating the crop of
Matoaha boy. the result would be
that the wealth of the state would be
increased nearly a quarter of a million
dollars this year in potatoes
nlone. The same number of corn
clubs would contribute as much.
Similar,clubs growing other things
would help. The result would be, If
i this work among the boys of .the
state was organized, systemstlsod, <
