Flashes from Wilson's
Gridiron Club Speech
Some of the interesting ex
pressions in the address at the
dinner of the Gridiron Club are
as follows:
"A man who seeks the Presi
dency of the United States for
anything that it will bring to
him is an audacious fool."
"America ought to keep out
of this war at the sacrifice of
everything except her sense of
humanity and justice."
"I would be just as much
ashamed to be rash as I would
to be a coward."
"Valor withholds itself from
all small implications and en
tanglements and waits for the
great opportunity when the
sword will flash as if it carried
the light of Heaven upon its
blade."
WILSON WOULD
GO FAR SEEKING
TO ESCAPE WAR
Tells Gridiron Diners, How
ever,, Expediency Can
Never Shape Course.
FOLLOWS IDEAL OF DUTY
Says He Would Be Ashamed
to Be Either Rash or
Coward.
Th- White House last night gave out
the text of President Wilson's speech
at the dinner of the Gridiron Club last
night. As a rule, speeches made at the
club dinners are held in the strictest con
fidence. In this instance the White
fouse obtained the consent of the club
to make the speech public.
The Prerident said:
'""t point in national affairs, gentle
ner.. never ile along the lines of expe
liency. It always rests in the field of prin
dple. The United States was not found
-1 upon any principle of expediency, and
whenever It bases Its policy upon any
other foundations than those it builds
on the sand and not upon solid rock.
Should Stake All for Justice.
"Senator Harding was saying just now
that we ought to try when we are a hun
dred million strong to act in the same
simplicity of irinciple that our forefath
ers acted in when we were three million
strong. I heard somebody say-I do not
know the exact statistics-that the pres
ent population of the United States is
one hundred and three millions. If there
are three million thinking the same
things that that original three million
thought, the hundred million will be
saved for an illustrious future. They were
ready to stake everything for an idea.
and that Idea was not expediency, but
justice.
"America ought to keep out of this
war. She ought to keep out of this
war at the sacrifice of everything ex
cept this single thing upon which her
character and history are founded. her
sense of humanity and justice. If she
sacrifices that, s' , has ceased to be
America; she has "ased to entertain
and to love the t itions which have!
made us proud tc o Americans, and
when we go about seeking safety at
the expense of humanity then I for
one. will believe that I have always
been mistaken in what I have conceived
to be the spirit of American history.

We stopped between Tenth and Eeventh

After Warren had looked at all the tires
he came around in front of the car and I
turned on him and began to shoot. I think
the first shot struck him In the arm. He
then threw up his arms and stumbled
over toward the tree and fell in a posi

shoot unti the gun was empty. I think
I shot eight times. The gun was an au

FIGHT AGAINST
BORLAND RIDER
GAINS GROUND
Opponents of Eight-Hour
Day to Swamp Legislators
with Protests.
DENOUNCED IN PULPIT
Rev. D. H. Martin, in Sermon,
Declares Measure Belongs
to Days of Slavery.
Opposition to the Borland rider to the
appropriations bill is crystallizing to such
an extent that those working agaimnt it
believe the measure is doomed
Before the present week is far advanced
theme opponents say members of Congress
will be swamped with letters and tele
grams ftVs thsr own districts; that the
emaive boards of the Washington
Chamber of Commerce and the Washing
ton Board of Trade will file their protests
against the rider, which imposes the
eight-hour rule upon every civil service
employe; that the American Federation
of Labor's antagon!sm will arouse every
union in the United States to come out
strongly against the measure; and that
the union men of Kansas City will stand
as one in fighting the idea, which has
been fostered by the Representative from
that Missouri district.
Maillma- Letter.
All day yestesday and far into the night
the office foroe of the Retail Merchants'
Association was busy mailing letfers to
boards of trade. chambers of commerce
and other similar associations through
out the country. These communications
are expected to cause their united action
against the rider.
It Is probable that the measure will
not come to the attention of the House
before Thursday or Friday.
Representative Gallivan, of Massachu
Betts, who believes the rider may be
stricken from the appropriation bills and
may never come to a vo'te. will have the
aid of other opponents in his efforts to
defeat.the measure on the ground that it
would add to. instead of decreasing the
government's expenses. Mr. Gallivan is
expected to lead the fight on the flour of
the House against the Borland amend
ment.
The charge that the government would
revert to the days of slavery if the Bor
land measure becomes a law was maje
yesterday morning by Rev. D). Ht. Martin.
pastor of the Dumbarton Avenue M. E.
Church. in his sermon. Rev. Mr. Martin
declared:
"An administration must be pretty hard
put when it has to resort to such meth
ods as taking the bread and butter out
of the mouths of the government labor
era, their wives and children, by cutting
salaries and increasing the hours of la
bor. When a government says to its peo
pie: 'We will make you work two or three
hours more a day.' It is reverting to the
days of slavery. It is taking an unfair
advantage of people who are weak in
their defense. It Is plain extortion." He
praised the Washington newspapers for
their opposition to the amendment
May Oendemen Rider.
At their meetthmgu today the executive
bodies of the Chamber of Commnerce and
the Board of Trade are expected to pass
resolutions oondemning the Borland
rider Officials of both stated yester
day that If the amendment becomes a
law, commercial interests in the Capi
tal will suffer a heavy loss, and that
the life of these im o dependent upon the
government clerks that what affects one
must necessarily react upon the other.
Mesnbers of the Washington Real
Estate Brokers' Association stand against
the passage of the rider and will prob
ably denounoe it at their next rmeeting.
