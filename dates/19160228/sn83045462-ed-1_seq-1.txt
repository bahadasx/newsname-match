it says, no mention was made ]
of armed merchantmen, and that the ?
United States in one of its notes on the j i
Lusitania mentioned unarmed nier- | j
chantmen. Attention then is called to j
the assurances previously given, in ;
which it is stated that liners will not ^
be sunk without warning, provided ]
they do not offer resistance. Attention
also is called to the statement of the 1
American government in its notice to '
port authorities, that the presence of }
armament orr board a merchant vessel i <
creates the presumption that the ves- '
sel is armed for offense.
Thinks Warning Impracticable.
It is stated that a submarine com- i
tuander cannot be expected to warn an *
enemy merchantman which has a right i *
to fire on the submarine which warns ?
it. and the German government sets j
up the contention that equipment and j
intention to resist a warning given by ?
a submarine does not come within the i
definition of defensive armament. 5
Germany contends that a similar view- ,
point was taken by the United States and that
it secured assurances from the Ital- I
iaii government that its armed merchant ;
ships leaving American ports would not 1
fire on submarines which warned them.
The note then sets forth that the German
government did not issue its new instructions
to submarine commanders uri- i
ill after it had come into possession of j
confidential instructions by the British j
government to the commanders of Brit- !
i.sh merchantmen. !
It is denied that armed British merchant
ships of any description are
peaceful traders, and it is declared
that the armament on board ail of them
is to he used especially for purposes
of attack.
Cites U. S. Note as Precedent.
The charge was made that Austrian
submarines also have been attacked
by armed British merchantmen. winch. }

and hu\e no intention of ronformins, to ;
thi assurances given to the I'nited States :
b\ the British government in a memo- !
raudun. of August "J-3. lf?I t. by Sir Cecil
Spring-Bice. the British ambassador. 1
The German government says it can- '
rot see how the American government. '
in consideration of these facts, can regard <
armed British merchantmen as peaceful'1
trading ships. The note makes it clear h
that the Berlin government believes its '
new instructions to submarine com- j
n.anders are in accord with the viewpoint
expressed by the I'nited States in
its memorandum proposing a modus
Vivendi to the entente ailies. for the
disarmament of merchant ships.
It declares that German submarine com- ,
ma riders have been so instructed that they
v ill not destroy a meridiant ship on a
?4U''3tion of armament unless it is known
}v -itiv'tj ihat such armament cists. The
ie.-laiai:on that previous pledges will net
If revoked also is formally given.
The efforts of the l.'iiitecl States to have
the belligerents agree to a modus vivendi
v. hi* !i would cause all merchant ships to
l>e disarmed, it is dec lared, are welcomed j
by Germany. Then follows a declaration '
that the German government will no
lofgei allow its submarines to be made
the objects of attacks in violation of the I
principles of internatirial law. and that. !
therefore, the new instructions will not j
be postponed or modified.

Tradition Rather Than Law."
The German government takes the
position that the arming of merchant
ships for defense is a tradition rather
man a ruie 01 international law. uernan
officials contend they find nowhere
n the international code any specific
authority for arming ships and that
the practice is from custom rather than
rule.
Germany is represented as taking: the
position that there are ships on the
seas which, in theory, are armed only
por defensive purposes, but that for all
practical purposes such armament is
offensive when a submarine is concerned.
t
Britain Denies Warning Citizens.
The British embassy today announced j
t had been authorized to deny that j
Jreat Britain warned her subjects off j

war.

Leaders of Neither Party
Disposed to Stir Up Issue
Over Submarine Warfare
In the Senate quiet prevailed today,
so far as any discussion of the sub- J
marine issue with Germany was con- j
cerned, except lor the reading of a !
letter, submitted by Senator Tillman !
of North Carolina, in which U. V. Den- j
nirigton of New York expressed the ;
opinion that persons who traveled on ,
beblligorent-owncd vessels were "fools,"
and "in nine cases out of ten ought to
be killed for being fools." j
The reading of the letter in the Senate
caused no discussion of the matter
by senators, and the subject matter
raised a laugh rather than any serious
consideration.
Leaders on both sides seemed content
lodav to lot matters drift so far aa tpe
submarine question was ooru-erned. To
juestions as to what Congress and the
country would do if the Germans persisted
in ra rrvinf r?n? - t?

sink armed merchantmen without
warning after Manh 1, they replied,
"Wait until the vessels are sunk."
Acquiesce in President's Demand.
"While acquiescing; in the demand of
the President to be allowed to carry
3ii diplomatic negotiations and to hanJlc
the situation through the State Department,
senators who have gone on
record as being opposed to having the
I'nited States involved in war over the
present issue with Germany today expressed
concern as to what was going
to happen if Germany did persist in
carrying out the orders or the admiralty.
Senator Gore, whose resolution
to warn Americans to keep off
armed belligerent-owned merchantmen
is still pending before the Senate, said
that he did riot expect to make any
move at this time to have it adopted.
He added, however, that he considered
the gravity of the situation as great as
ever and felt that the I'nited States was
fast drifting on the rocks of war.
Danger of Delay.
The senator said that f Congress and
the President waited until after German
submarines had sunk armed merchantmen
without warning, it. would he too
late to take such steps as he had
suggested f<>r keeping Americans safe
ami avoiding further complications. He
pointed out that at suc4i a time, when

that the cry of economy in behalf

reduce it from 'JO tents a mile each ;

In case it comes to an issue a
compromise may be effected between

the steamship struck a mine an

| Of the 1 ly passengers, th
names of sixty-four have been re

Y. M. C. A. workers in the arm
there.
The bodies of forty-seven vie
tyns have been recovered, an
many relatives have arrived a
Dover to identify the dead.
The British press is almost unani
mous in assuming that the Maloja an
the other vessels sunk by mines durln
the week end were victims of a fres
sowing of German mines. There j
much speculation as to how these mine
could have been laid. The theory mos
frequently advanced is that a certai
class of neutral shipping has been eir
ployed. It is pointed Out that such oj:
erations may drive England to sti
more stringent supervision of neutrj
shipping than has yet been exercise
by the admiralty.
Sister Ship of the Persia.
The Peninsular and Oriental line stean
ship Maloja was an Australian mail bos
and a sister ship of the Persia, which wa
torpedoed and sunk off the Island <
Crete December 30 last, with the loss <
336 lives. The Maloja was last reporte
as having arrived at Marseille Januar
31, bound for London from Sydney, Ne
South Wales.
The steamship was C50 feet long, C
feet beam and 34 feet deep. She wa
built at Beifast in 191 i.
In February of 1915 it was reporte
that the Maloja, on entering the Engllg
channel with 400 passengers on boari
was ordered to stop by an unknow
armed merchantman. The mail boat
said to have ignored the order and mad
for Plymouth, whereupon the inercham
man fired five shells at her, but all fe
short.
The Empress of Fort William was fot

at Newcastle in 1908. She was 250 fee
long. 43 feet beam and 22 feet deep. Th
vessel was owned by the Empress Trans

, j The Maloja left Tilbury only yester
\ ! day for Bombay, with mails, 119 pas
J sengers of all classes aboard and ;
I crew numbering about 200, most o
! them Lascars. Other passengers wer
m I to join the ship at Marseille.
I ' The steamer had just passed Ad
j iniralty pier at Dover arid was opposit
Shakespeare cliff when an explosioi
| shook her from end to end. She liste*
i immediately to port. High seas wer
running and the captain, realizing tha
j great damage had been done to th
aft part of his vessel, tried to run he
i aground, but the engine room wa
| swamped and the ship became unman
j ageable.
j i The plight of the vessel was observe*
i and dozens of craft went at full spee*
I to her rescue. One of them, the Brit
| ish tanker Empress of Port William
of 2.181 tons, struck another mine an*
d | sank nearby.
; Aboard the Maloja everything pos
I ! si hie was done to get the passenger
land crew off. All the boats had al
j ready been swung out before sir
: struck, as a nrecain ioii asrainsr. aci-i
j dent, and all those aboard had suffi

ashore, and their number was gradu

| owing 'o the fact that Dover is uti
^ j der strict military law it was possibl
j to obtain only meager details fron
i those rescued. The captain said tha
p ! the boat's passengers and crew be
fhaved splendidly.

A Relief boats quickly put out from th<

sengers when the liner went down.
The Maloja carried in the flrst-clas:
cabin twenty-six men. twenty-thre<
