Admiral Knight Outlines Pol
Icy of Equalling Strongest
Naval Power by 1925.
WASHINGTON. Feb. :8.-Tlic Navy
General Hoard' conception of tho
heeds of tho Cnltod States as a naval
power wero outllt.cd to tho Hmiso
Naval Commlttco to. day by Hear Ad
miral Knight, Presldont of the- Navy
War College. Tn formulating tho po'U
Icy that tlio navy should equal tho
trongest afloat by 1925. ho mid, tho
board had In mind tho establishment
of two flcetH, 0110 l tho Pacific power
ful onoUKh tn overcome any enomy
thoro, and tho "Iher In tho Atlantic,
svhero It would bo exceeded In
i utrcngth only by tho Hrltlsh fleet.
X total foreo sllghtl- In excess of
tho strength of tho Hrltlsh fleet, ho
eald, would nrcompllsh tills purpo.io
bnd lnauro tho country against 93 out
cf 100 possibilities of International
complications.
Tho navy Is not ready to exert
more than DO per cent, of Its strength
In uhlps and guns, Rear Admiral
Knight ald. Ho urHed tho Immediate
mddltlon of 25,000 enlisted men and
oostructlon of bnttlo cruiser and
routing craft to meet tho situation.
American battleships, tho Admiral
declared, iiro equal to uny lmllt, and
ameers and men of thn Meet aro well
trained and etllrlent. but If the At
lantic fleet wero ordeied out to-day
to defend the whole coast lino It would
bo unable to tolio all Its available
whips for lack of mon and would be
compelled to fight blindfolded for
Uck of scouts.
Admiral Knight submitted a sketch
of posslblo naval movements In the
Atlantic to show that an enemy fleot
could atrlko virtually where it pleasod
unless scouting craft wero provided to
find It. The first step in tho building
programme this year, he said, should
be the authorization of six battle
cruisers and eight scouts, all with a
speed ot 35 knots.
Tho present floot, Admiral Knight
added, was unbalanced In men and
Bcouta to such an extent that Its wholo
defensive mission was endangered.
Bbortngo of men, ho said, represented
two-third of all tho troublo with tho
navy.
It tho committee supplied at once
the 25,000 mon and provided for tho
ships, It would have gono a long way
toward mnklnl the navy an clHcic;nt
lorce.
To round out tho building pro
gramme Admiral Knight suggested
that a repair ship, a hospital ship, an
ammunition ship, two aeroplanes,
twenty destroyers and thirty sub
marines, preferably of tho 800-ton
typo, should bo authorized at onco.
"What he proposed, ho said, could be
taken care of within a year, as It ro
qulrod only a small amount of armor
Jn construction,
Admiral Knight also rocommondod
provision In the ponding 1)111 for n
Daval base in tho Caribbean Boa and
Tor a floating drydock largo enough to
take a rtC.OOO-ton battleship. To In
rare defonso of thn Philippines, ho
old, a "Heligoland or a Malta" should
he Ibullt up as a navnl base at Guam.

American Among Saved.
LONDON, Fob. 28. Ilovlseil figures
show that 163 porsons, Including fifty-'
llvo passengers, aro missing and prob
ably lust in tho sinking of tho Penln
iular and Oriental liner Maloja by a
mine noar Dover yesterday. The re
vised llgures show that the Muloja
carried 42'J persons, Including 113 pas
sengers, and account for only 260
survivors.
Despatches to shipping oftlces to-"
day brought word of tho sinking of
the Russian steamer Pe'shenga, the
eighth vessel to mcot disaster within
tho past forty-eight hours, fifteen of
her crow having bcon landed. Tho
others, In addition to tho liner Maloja
and tho Empress of Fort William,
which went to her aid, nro tho Hrltlsh
steamers Hlrglt. Dido nnd Suevlcr, tho
French steamer Trlgnao and tho
Dutch steamer Mecklenburg.
About ascoro of woman luid chil
dren were among those who lost their
lives when tho Maloja turned turtle,
whllo dozens of smaller craft wero
hastening to her assistance. Tho
bodios of twelvo women and six chil
dren had been landed at Dover to-day
nnd placed In tho morgue for Identifi
cation. Several of tho survivors aro
near death from exposure
Tho bodies of about fifty of tho vic
tims httvo been recovered so far. Many
persons urn arriving at Dover for tho
purposo of identifying thn dead.
Ralph Foster, an American, is one
of tho lurvivinp passengers. He ii
the son of Rev. Festus Foter of To
peka, Kan., and a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford. Foster had been (liven
a year's leave of absence to enter
Army Y. M. C. A. work and was en
route for Enyp to Join workers in
the army there.
Among those rescued was a baby,
warmly clad, which was found floating
on Its back. The child wan discovered
by n patrol boat and was taken Into
the cnglno room. After being warmed
It smiled at Its rescuers and seemed
nono tho worm for tho Immersion.
All the hurvlvors who reached Lou
don to-duy agreed Hint tlmro was
llttlo panic aboard. Tho loss of life
among thu pitNsengors would have
bon very small, thoy statod, had not
two of the boats collldod In tho water,
ono ot them capsizing.
An olllulal Inquiry was ordered to
day to dntermlno how It happened
that tho liner struck a mine.
Tho HrltlHli press Is almost unani
mous in assuming that tho Maloju uud
tho other ic'xpIh sunk by inlue.s dur
ing tho wetl. I wero victims of a
fresh sowing of German mines. There
Is much speculation as to how these
mines could ha e been laid. Tho theory
most frequently advanced Is that u
certain cuu3 ot neutral shipping wus
employed.
Tho Pall Mall Garotte suggests that
such opcratlona may drive England
to still morn stringent supervision ot
neutral shipping than ha.s yet been
exercised by tlio Admiralty.
Tho bodios of cigut sailors and tho
captain of tlio Wilson IJner Dido,
which was sunk last Saturday, were

o Germany's, intention, beginning

ot u ticicniuii.moii or ningel s gum,

tors placed about !,000,0l)u and re

was owing to this lack of knowledge
that Hlegel was not tried on tho In

tacks at Verdun and Capture of
1 5,000Prisoners to Date Battle in
Eighth Day "Bloodiest in History."'
PARIS ADMITS BIG LOSS
IN CHAMPAGNE REGION
Premier JJriniul announced in Paris yesterday that
Hie (ionium drive til Verdun had been cheeked after the
first '.four days of the battle, which is now Ju. its eighth
duy and is being fought with an. intensity as great
ever. Already it is being called the bloodiest struggle,
in history.
Despatches from Paris lo-day indicate that the
II .1 l T 1
r reiich line north of Verdun
pressing the attack on the
Mihicl, but were repulsed at Manheullcs, thirteen miles
southeast of Verdun. Paris also claims checks at Eix and
Hill 85fl.
Although despatches from Berlin declare that thn
,i ,
'' ''" " iuin iinuiii
captured 15,1()0 prisoners to date, Ihe points numcd
have heretofore been mentioned as being in German
hands. '
Some significance is attached lo a new German
offensive in the Champagne, resulting in the capture of
Navarin Farm and French positions on both sides for r
distance of l,UOu yards. It is said that more than 1,000
French were captured. Paris admits the loss of Navarin
Farm in a surprise attack. In some quarters it is believed
the new move indicates German failure at Verdun and
that this failure is to be offset in Champagne.
Surgeons in charge of the wounded, says a Paris
despatch, declare there must be .'10,000 wounded men
dying on the battlefield in snow and rain becuuse their
comrades cannot get to them.
Ueports from Loudon declare that Prince Henry of
Prussia, brother of the Kaiser, has been placed in .com
mand of the German navy and that a dash into the North
Sea is expected by the fleet in connection with the new
U-boat raid.
