dues will be received. Girls may pay
their dues for both semesters from 9

of this week. Tables will be placed as
usual In the women's parlors, Academ
ic Hall, for that purpose.
No girl is entitled to a vote for May

council, many girls are negligent in

COLUMBIA BEAUTIFUL
IS CIVIC LEAGUE AIM
Women and Children to Im
prove City's Appearance
bv Horticulture.
TO GIVE SEEDS FREE
Contestants Are to Receive
Prizes for Best Cultivated
Garden Plots.
The women of Columbia, working
with the Women's Civic League, are
beginning their annual campaign to
improve Columbia's good looks. Ev
erything that .tends to mar the beauty
of the town will be fought vigorously,
and everything that will add to the
city's pleasing appearance will be sup
ported and encouraged.
In the last weeks of April the Civic
League will distribute seeds and
plants among the children. This year,
besides seeds and plants, perennial
vines will be given out, so that the
children may have the results of their
efforts with them ven when the
spring and summer are gone. And an
other surprise will be instruction in
how the plants should be cared for.
This instruction will be given at the
schools by some professor from the
horticultural department of the Uni
versity. In the past it has been found that
one of the best ways to beautify the
town is to interest the children. And
the best way to interest them is, in
the mind of the leaders, to offer prizes
for the best gardens or improvement
of yards. This year first, second and
third prizes will be given for the
greatest improvement any child makes
on his or her own yard. The seeds,
shrubs and vines necessary for the
work will be given to the children
free of charge, and a teacher will go
to the homes to tell how to care for
the plants. After this the Biiccess or
failure of the enterprise will depend
largely on the efforts of the children
themselves.
WILL FIGHTMEASLES
Fifteen New Cases in Grade
and High Schools Make
Total of 30.
"Fifteen new cases of measles have
been reported since last Sunday. This
makes a total of thirty cases among
the grade and high school pupils of
Columbia. It is up to the parents of
Columbia to check the spread of this
contagious disease," said J. E. Mc
pherson, superintendent of public
schools, today. Besides these there
are many cases of measles among the
University students.
"The disease Is not beyond control,"
said Mr. McPherson this morning, "but
the rapid spread of measles in the past
few days calls for every effort on our
part and on the part of the people of
Columbia if we are to keep it under
control.
"Any signs of sore throat or ailment
that is a forerunner of measles should
be immediately investigated by the
parents before they allow their chil
dren to attend school further. If this
precaution were exercised, the spread
of nfasles would be checked In short
order.
"Only one case of scarlet fever has
been reported, and no new develop
ments are expected from this disease.
The physicians and the Board of
Health are doing everything within
their power to check the spread of
measles. But If the parents are care
less, it will be a very easy thing to
spread .he disease among the school
children.
"If the parents of Columbia will take
my advice, they will keep their chil
dren away from practically all public
gatherings, for a while at least. Every
absence in the grade and high schools
is reported to me, and the reason for
the absence is learned at once by the
truant officer. In this way we have
been able to keep posted on the health
conditions of the pupils in a very sys
tematic way. I have a record of every
case of sickness among the pupils at
this time and know the nature of the
sickness."
Missionary Circle Hears Mothers.
The Nellie Hart missionary circle
held a special meeting yesterday after
noon at the home of Misses Helen and
Mittie V. Robnett. The mothers of the
young women of the circle and several
members of the C. W. B. M. made talks.
Miss Louise Miller sang two solos.
WOMAN, UNPREPARED,
PREACHES!! SERMON
Mrs. Turner McBaine Fills
Pulpit at Wilkes Boul
evard Church.
SPEAKS FOR PASTOR
Visitor Responds to Plea of
Minister Who Has a
Sore Throat.
There are not many persons who
could preach a sermon if called upon
to do so without opportunity for pre
paration. Columbia may boast of a
woman, Mrs. Turner McBaine, who is
equal to such an emergency.
Yesterday morning, she was a vis
itor to the Wilkes Boulevard Metho
dist Church. The pastor, the Rev.
. B. Coffman, was not disposed to
preach on account of a sore throat
from a strenuous revival campaign of
the preceding week. Recognizing
Mrs. McBaine as a speaker whom l:j
had heard in missionary meetings
over the state, he decided to givd Ins
congregation a treat and himself a
iest by asking her to say sometl.itig.
Mrs. McBaine protested her inabil
ity to speak on such short notice, but
finally yielded to the pastor's Insis
tence. In doing so, she said that If she
was to be arraigned for preaching, she
would be without even the excuse of
fered by a Presbyterian woman
who said that though not ordained to
preach she was foreordained.
Her discourse took up the entire
time of the regular Sunday morning
sermon.
Mrs. McBaine took for her text He
brews II, l: "Therefore we ought to
give the more earnest heed to the
things which we have heard, lest at
any time we should let them slip."
"We all of us know so many good
things," she said. "I wonder why we
are not better. I don't think that any
of us fail in our Christian life from
any desire to faik There is In all of
us the purpose to live up to our ideals.
but we are constantly slipping. It is
possible for us to build up a spiritual
resisting force that will enable us to
overcome all temptations, just as it is
possible for us to build up a physical
resisting force that enables us to over
come germs of disease. But we can
not do it of our own strength. God,
however, has said that he has a strong
resisting force that he wants to give
us, and it is ours for the taking."
