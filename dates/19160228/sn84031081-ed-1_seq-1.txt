The steamer had just passed Admir
ttlty pier at. Dover and was opposite
Shakespeare cliff when an explosion
shook her from end to end. She listed
immediately to port. High seas were
running and the captain, realizing that
yreat damage had been done to the
after part of his vessel, tried to run
her aground, but the engineroom was
(damped and the ship became unman
ageable. Help Itcspouds Quickly.
The plight of the vessel was ob
served and dozens of era ft went at
full speed to her rescue, one of them,
the Kritish tanker Empress of Fort
William, of 2,1M tons, struck another
mine and sank nearby.
Aboard the Maloja everything possi
ble was done to get the passengers and
crew off. All the boats hud already
bern swung out before he struck as
a precaution against accident unci all
ttwe aboard had sufficient time to
put on llfebeltH, instruction in the use
of which had been previously given.
Several personn leaped into the water
ii nd were picked up by the .surround'

all had been saved, but later, bodies
were washed ashore and their number
was gradually added to during the
day.

while under the water the vessel
lighted herself, the masts became vis

work more difficult. The majority ot

of the women and children lost their

on the original cost of the vessel, the
value of which had increased enor

Ellis, an 18-year-old boy, rescued
Charles Thomas Saturday night half
frozen and nearly lifeless from a tree
in the flood and ice packed Des
Moines river where he had clung to
the branches seven hours after seeing
a companion drown.
Thomas and A. E. Rommel!, Ma

party attempting to dynamite the ice
floe when they were swept into the
stream, Itomtncli perishing. Thomas
caught in the top ot a tree which had
been partly submerged by the flood.
The swollen channel was filled with
great cakes of Ice hurled onward by
the swift current, and it was deemed
impossible to reach Thma until the
youth, Kills, in a frail skiff, made a
perilous but successful dush through
the ice to a point near where the
marooned man was clinging to the
tree.

Lodging his boat against two other
inundated trees to keep it from being
swept downward by the current, the
boy repeatedly threw a rope toward

near enough to enable Thomas to
make it fast to a branch of the tree.
Ellis secured his end to one of the
trees nt the boat and Thomas slid
down.
In his slide down the rope Thomas,
exhausted, dropped into the water.
He sunk, but the boy in the boat, seiz
