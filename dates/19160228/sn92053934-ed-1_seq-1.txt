NOTE TO BERNSTORFF
German Government Sends
Instructions to Ambassa
dor for Negotiations.
Washington. Feb. 2. In a note
presented to Secretary I, arising to
day by Count von Hcrnstorff, the
(.erman ambassador, Germany as
cures the I lilted States that it has
no intention of revoking the
pledees (riven in the Lusitania
case.
The note says Germany can con
ceive of no reason for changing or
postponing the new instructions of her
submarine commanders to treat as
war ships enemy merchant ships
armed "defensively" and that special
precautions have been taken to pre
vent ships that are not armed from
being attacked.
Baron Zwiedinek, charge of the Aus
trian embassy, followed Count von
Bernstorff to Secretary Lansing's of
fice and conferred a few minutes. No
statement was made as to his visit,
but it was understood he told Mr.
Lansing Austria's position was the
same as Germany's.
Reiterates Pledges.
The note at the outset reiterated the
previous pledges, which were given on
Sept. 1 and Oct. 5 last year for the
?afety of unresisting iineps and then
goes on to say the German government
does not believe those assurances have
been modified by the new memoran
dum. During the negotiations over the
Lusttanla, it says, no mention was
made of armed merchantmen, and that
the United States in one of its notes on
the Lusitania mentioned unarmed mer
chantmen. Attention then is called to
the assurances privately given in
which it iB stated that liners will not
be sunk without warning, provided
they do not offer resistance. Atten
tion is called to the statement of the
American government in its notice to
port authorities that the presence of
armament on board a merchant ves
sel creates the -presumption that the
vessel is armed for offense.
. It is stated that a submarine com
mander cannot be expected to warn
an enemy merchantman which has a
right to fire on the submarine which
warns it, and the German government
Baid the contention and intention to
resist a warning given by a submarine
does not come within the definition of
defensive armament.
.Mentions Italian Assurances.
Germany contends that a similar
viewpoint was taken by the United
States and that it had assurances from
the Italian government that its armed
merchant ships leaving American ports
would not fire on submarines which
warned them. The note then sets forth
that the German government did not
issue its new instruction to submarine
commanders until it had come into
possession of confidential instructions
by the British government to com
manders of British merchantmen. It
is denied that armed British merchant
ships of any description are peaceful
traders, and it is declared that the
armament on board all of them is to
be used especially for purposes of at
tack. Seen In American Light
The note makes it clear that the
Berlin government believes its new in
structions to submarine commanders
are in accord with the viewpoint ex
pressed by the United States in its

DESPERATE CONVICT
ESCAPES FROM PEN
Burlington, la., Feb. 28. Smith
Dodge, of Burlington, serving a 30
years' sentence for murder in the state
Penitentiary at Fort Madison, escaped
Sunday evening. Dodge had charge of
the wagon gat of the prison and
lipped out under cover of a milk
agon.
His escape was discovered about 15
minutes later and a posse of guards
t as sent in pursuit. Dodge is a des
' perate criminal and has a bad record.
It is not thought that he can long
elude capture, as his left hand is cut
off at the wrist. He was sent down
from Burlington in December, 1912,
for the fatal stabbing of a man named
Gleger during a drunken row in a
tabin boat.

TRANSPORT LINER
NOW IN NEW YORK
Passenger Ship Requisitioned by Brit
ish Government Arrives Crew
Silent.
New York, Feb. 28. Officers of the
White Star liner Cedric, here today for
the first time since November, 1914,
when she was requisitioned by the
British government as a transport for
troops, declined to reveal anything
concerning the government service in
which the trans-Atlantic liner has
been engaged. Members of the crew
as well as officers said they were
under pledge to the British authorities
to tell nothing concerning the Cedric's
war movements! It has been reported
that the steamer was used to carry
troops to France, Egypt and the Dar
danelles. The only outward sign of the1 Ced
ric's use was the gray paint which
covered her superstructure and the
hinged steel plates that hid her ports
so that she could pass unseen in the
night. Although the staterooms were
removed when she was taken for trans
port, most of them have been restored
for use of her officers. Her huge danc
ing salon was used as a drill hall for
troops. The Cedric is unarmed and
shows .no signs of having had guns
while equipped as a transport. She
was released by the admiralty to carry
war munitions and supplies from this
country to England but is still ready
for transport service when desired.

been used as a war transport, said
that the London conference on naval
prizes reached no decision on that
point.

British Press Says Disaster;
Is Due to New Sowing
of German Mines.
Dover, Feb. 28, (2:50 p. m.) A
continuous search by boats in the
vicinity of the sunken steamer Ma
loja and inquiries along the coast .
had failed up to mid-afternoon to
day to raise the number of known
survivors of the disaster, 260, of
whom 61 are passengers.
It was feared the death list
wonld be well over 150.. Bodies
continue to be washed ashore and
50 persons have thus far been ac
counted for.
The steamship company's state
ment regarding the number of peo
ple on board the Maloja, Issued
tliis afternoon, showed that of 119
passengers, 19 were children. The
ship's officers were given as in
cluding the commander, fonr nav
igating officers, 13 engineering of
ficers, surgeon and parser.
London, Feb. 28, (10:35 a, m.) Of
the total complement of 411 passen
gers and crew on the Peninsular and
Oriental line steamer Maloja, which
struck a r.4ne and sank within half an
hour two miles off Dover yesterday,
only 260 are known to be saved. Of
the total 119 passengers, 64 names of
persons saved have been received at
the steamship company's offices. It
was stated there that it is hoped that
more names of persons saved still will
be received.
The bodies of three more Lascars of
the crew of the Maloja have been
washed ashore, making the total of
bodies recovered 47. Many relatives
are arriving at Dover for the purpose
of endeavoring to identify bodies.
Baby Smiles at Its Rescuers.
Among those rescued yesterday was
a baby, warmly clad, which was found
floating on its back. The child was
discovered by a patrol boat and was
taken Into the engine room. After be
ing warmed it smiled at its rescuers
and seemed none the worse for the
immersion.
The British press is almost unani
mous in assuming that the Maloja and
the other vessels sunk by mines dur
ing the week end were victims of a
fresh sowing of German mlneB by neu
tral shipping.
The Pall Mall Gazette suggests that
such operations may drive England to
still more stringent supervision of
neutral shipping.
Bodies of Dido Sailors Found.
The bodies of eight sailors and the
captain of the Wilson liner Dido,
which was sunk on Feb. 2 , were
washed ashore today at Donnahook,

gross, carried a crew of 29 men. The
first reports of her sinking said that
the captain and two of the crew had
been landed by a Belgian steamer.
