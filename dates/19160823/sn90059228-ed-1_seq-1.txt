Prom the Grand Forks Herald:
One man is dead, two more may
not live and four women and one
other man are severely bruised and
cut as the result of an accident
shortly after 9 o'clock Saturday night,
when the Studebaker automobile
owned by Peter Dahlberg of North
land, Minn., and driven by his son,
William Dahlberg, went into a ditch
five miles north of East Grand
Porks while traveling at a speed
estimated at 40 miles an hour.

the past two years employed by the
Grand Forks Fruit company, wa^

up. William Dahlberg of Northland,
his brother, and John Hofstad, also
employed by the Grand Forks Fruit
company, are the two men who are
now confined in a local hospital, both
with broken shoulders, fractured ribs
and other injuries that it is feared
may prove fatal. John Hofstad's
condition is very critical. Otto
Stavig, who, with the two Dahlberg
^"boys, was in the front seat, escaped
with severe bruises and sprains and
was able to return to his home at
^Alvarado.
Women Will Recover.
The women in the party were Mrs.
John Hofstad of Grand Forks and
Misses Alma and Edna Stavig and
Uelle Olson of Alvarado. All sus
tained painful bruises and are suffer
Ing from the nervous shock. Their
condition is not serious, according
"Ho medical authorities.
According to the story, told by the
the city last evening with the Alva
rado young people to take Mr. and
Mrs. Hofstad and Alex Dahlberg to
a dance which was given at North
land. The car was a four cylinder,
five passenger Studebaker and the
eight young people crowded into the
machine. Several large boxes con
taining luncheon were also taken
along.
Skid Was Fatal.
The party left the city shortly af
"ter 9 o'clock and were driving at a
xapid rate along the north road out
of East Grand Forks when the ma
chine skidded. At this point the
members of the party appear to
have forgotten all further happen
ings and were unable to give a clear
account of what had taken place.
Joseph Jarvis of East Grand
Porks, who brought the dead lad
and William Dahlberg to Grand
Porks, gives the following account
cf the accident:
"I was driving north out of East
Grand Forks when I heard the
klaxon of an approaching machine.
I turned to one side of the road to
let the car pass, but I was unable to
recognize any of the occupants of
the machine as they were traveling
at, I should judge, about 40 miles an
hour.

I was going about 20 miles an
I hour and they were going much fas
ter than my car.
Finds Ghastly Wreck.
*Their machine rapidly disappear
ed in the distance, but I had travel
ed but a short distance further when
I met a man with a horse, who told
me that there was an automobile
wreck a little way down the road.
I hurried to the scene and found the
car, the same one _that had passed)
me a few minutes before, turned
completely around. The occupants
were strewn all around and only one
of the men was conscious (Otto Sta
wig) and he was endeavoring to
.quiet the girls who were running
.about and crying.
\x *'$0ther cars came along but none
tff tfiekdrivers would help me pick up
the bleeding and bruised lads and I
was forced to do it alone. I carried
rthe two who appeared to be in the
worst condition to my machine and
Joe Huderie took the remainder of
the patty in his car and we started
fo town. jv?
"One of tne boysT
(mefffing Alex

I reached him. Two others were un

complete somersault. The condittm
of the machine indicated that it had
rolled entirely over as thp bothvn
was badly damaged, the top crushed
in, windshield smashed and the
fenders and running board wereim
wrenched and torn.
According to the information re
ceived by Coroner Nelson, the acci
dent occurred when an attempt was
made to pass a horse drawn vehicle
going in the opposite direction. The
car ran too far onto the side of the
road and in the effort to regain the
grade too sharp a turn was made
and the machine tipped over, throw
ing the occupants out.
CYCLONIC STORM

Gust A. Johnson, of Alma, is Injured
When New Barn is Wrecked.
A storm of a cyclonic nature pass
ed over Alma and some other towns
of the county on Wednesday evening
last week. A new barn that had
just been completed on the farm of
Gust A. Johnson, of Alma, was suck
ed up by the storm and completely
demolished. Mr. Johnson and some
other men were in the barn and
looked out thru the door when he
noticed the approach of a dark
threatening whirlwind that sucked up
loose dirt and everything else in its
path. He called to the men to get
out of the barn, and they had no
sooner done so than it was struck/
and lifted high in the air, grazing
the top of a grove that stood be
tween it and the living house, nar
rowly missing the latter. The body
of the barn was torn in a thousand
splinters. Mr. Johnson was struck
in the back by a flying board and
badly bruised. One side of his body
became paralyzed and it was feared
that his spine had been injured. The
doctor was called from Warren to
reader aid, but later developments
proved that the injury was not ser

THE KNAPP REALTY
BLDG. AT JOLIET.
The Sheaf has received a copy of
the Joliet, 111. Evening Herald-News
containing a full page advertisement
of the Pioneer Land & Loan Co.t of
which concern W. A. Knapp is the
president. The ad contains a cut and
description of the Knapp Realty
Building at Joliet, a large, handsome,
three-story brick structure, in which
the land company occupies a suite of
four rooms in the second story.
Several cuts of Marshall county,
Minn, farms and buildings are in
corporated in the ad together with
some excellent descriptive matter.
Mr. Knapp went to Joliet from War
ren about twelve years ago to open
and conduct the office of the Pioneer
Land & Loan Company, the principal
business of which is selling Marshall
county land. By industry, ability
and fair dealing he has succeeded in
building up an extensive business.
Mr. Knapp is one of the best and
most genial of men and he richly
deserves the success that he has
achieved. One reason for his success
is that he has always had unbounded
faith in the capabilities of Marshall
county soil, a soil which never dis
appoints those who use it rightly.

INFANTILEPARALYSIS
INVADES POLK CO.
Old Girl at Fisher
Dies From the Disease Last
Week.Health Ordinances
Must Be Recognized*
Glenora Krostue, the 14-year-old
daughter of Mrs. G. Krostue, of
Fisher, died from infantile paralysis,
after an illness lasting since the
previous Friday. The little Fisher
girl is the first victim to be claimed
by the disease in the northwest.
On Friday she became seriously
ill, but
until Tuesday did it be-
come known that her affliction was
infantile paralysis. The alarm was
spread broadcast, and the entire
village of Fisher was placed under
quarantine. Children wfcre not per
mitted to play in the streets or al
leys and every precaution was taken
to prevent a spread. J"
Until Thursday morning, hopes
were entertained for the Krostue
girl's recovery, but a bad sinking
spell followed a restless night and
at 2:10 o'clock in the afternoon
death relieved her sufferings.
Funeral services were held Friday
morning at 10 o'clock over the re
mains. The services were attended
by members of the family only and
interment was made in the Fisher
cemetery.
Local officials, headed by the city
board of health, are carrying out a
clean-up campaign in order to re
move every source where disease
might be contracted. Residents of
the city have been urged, to make a
special effort to clean up yards and
alleys and to have all garbage cans
removed regularly.
Any violation of the city health
ordinances will be prosecuted, claim
officials, as every effort must be
made to prevent an invasion of
contagious maladies.

Washington, Aug. 18.Without
debate or record vote the child labor
bill was accepted by the house to
day, with the senate amendment and
put on its way to become a law,
with President Wilson's signature.
It would not have become a law(
at this session of congress had not
President Wilson, after the Demo
cratic caucus decided to eliminate it
from the administration program,
visited the capitol and insisted upon
its inclusion.
As it originally passed the house
it proposed to bar from interstate
commerce products on which child
labor actually had been employed^
As amended by the senate and now
perfected, it prohibits shipments be
tween the states of all products of
any establishment which employes
child labor.
It bars products of any mine or
quarry employing children under 16,
or products of any mill, cannery,
workshop, factory or manufacturing
establishment employing children un
der 14, or which employs children

STUNG BY GROCERY
PEDDLER ON MOTOR
Polk County People Find Cut Price
Bargains Are Put on "Back
Order" List By Chicago
House.
People of this vicinity are warned
to pass up the tempting bait offered
by a. grocery peddler, mounted on a
motorcycle, who made a canvas in
Po]jc county recently. Many sales
were made where bargains in
groceries, so alluring that most
people were tempted and fell, were
offered. Sugar, for example, was
offered for two and a half to three*
dollars less than home merchants
would sell it. Other staples were
offered at similar low prices and the
buyer had at last found a way to
cut the high cost of living. But
other goods were ordered at the
same time,goods that were not
such bargains, but orders were given
because the agent was a good fellow,
and" sold sugar cheap. Thenwhen
the shipment arrivedthere was no
sug^r and there were none of the
oth^r great bargains in the lot, but
the regular priced goods were there,
-also a nice letter telling that the
wholesale house was out of sugan
and other bargains and they would
"be (shipped as soon as possible."
Thus again those who patronized
the stranger are stung, for, of
course, the sugar will never arrive,
nor with it the other bargains, and
the fpurchaser has paid a higher
pricej in cash than he would have
paid on time with the local merchant.
It's ja pretty safe bet to play fair
with the home merchant. He's
always here where you can get at
him if he misrepresents.

Interesting Letter From Clinton
Winchester, a Warren Boy,
Telling of Army Life
on the Border.
Llano Grande, Texas,
Co. D., 1st Minn. O. M.
August 13, 1916.
Warren Sheaf:
Well, almost a month has passed
since we first landed in this ,part of
the country and everything is gett
ing better.
When we first came into Llano
Grande, the 16th of July, the whole
country was covered by a thick
growth of mesquite and cactus.
Three hours after our arrival on
the camping grounds, the tents were
up and part of the streets were
cleared of most of the thorny under
growth. Then followed a week of
nerve racking, back breaking work,
by unclimated men from cities, for
most of the first regiment is com
posed of city men. However, these
men, with few exceptions, stood up
under the grueling heat very well.
One of the worst things which
the troops had to contend with waa
the lack of water and at times this
seemed almost serious. Our com
pany was without water for a
whole twelve hours. Even the cooks
were without the liquid. Then, as
never, was water prized by the men.
However, by the end of the week
this shortage was remedied. The
water was hot, and we were unable
to obtain any ice, so for some time
we did not enjoy our drinks at all.
Now, however, that is all changed
and every morning we have over 100-
pounds of ice for drinking water.
We have shower baths, floors in
our tents, and a peach of a Y. M. C.
A., where fellows can go to religious
exercises and also to play checkers,
write, read and hold shows.
The Minnesota troops, that is the
1st regiment, is to leave in about
two weeks for Brownsville, to dot
guard duty for a few weeks, after
which it returns to St. Paul.
Our^Jreglmdnt- is' the" most Efficient
one the guards. That is a big
compliment when you consider that
there are about forty states having
guards. We feel very proud of
our record.
The Dakota guards are here, also
the Nebraska and Indiana regiments.
Friday we have long hikes. We
began by taking a short one of six
miles and then increasing the dis
tance each Friday. Last Friday we
hiked fifteen miles under light packs.
All but three of our company finish
ed and these men were not in hik
ing condition, so they were not to
blame.
We have fine officers from the
Non-Com's to the Colonel. He sure
is a brick. Friday instead of riding
a horse as he could have done, he*
walked and finished freshest of all.
Our "chuck" is good and plenty of
it. At first it was a little scarce
but now it couldn't be beat.
I was on* out post duty a weety
ago to-night. Was pretty nervous
for a while because two nights be
fore a private in "A Company" was
shot thru the hand by a greaser
trying to run some mules from the
government corrals. He will lose a.
couple of fingers.
Allison Clark is in Company E.
I have seen him real often. I also
ran across Sands, from Alvarado.
He is Company clerk for"K". In our
Company there are nine Macalester
men. So it is real pleasant for me.
Hoping that some of this writing*
will be readable to you, I remain
Yours truly,
Clinton T. Winchester.
