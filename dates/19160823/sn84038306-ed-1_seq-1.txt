SOLDIERS ANXIOUS TO SEE AMERICANS

(Edith F. Norton.)
Many times in their letters, our
boys would say, "Oh father and lit
tie mother, if only you could visit us
in the trenches, and see for yourself
how we live or if you could come
back of the lines of La Panne, where
wo could come and visit you, how
happy we should be!"
Then one day in March of 1916, the
unexpected and longer-for actually
materialized, and we found ourselves
in La Panne, the tiny seaside capitol
of unconquered Belgium. How we se
cured this permission, next to impos
sible for the ordinary civilian to re
ceive, would make too long a story,
But let It fce said that the Belgian au
thorities did not consider'us as being
ordinary civilians, for our loving but
unostentations ministrations to the
scores of Belgian soldiers in whom
we had become interested had given us
a different status in their eyes so it
was that we owed this privilege to
the kindly intervention of M. Vander
velde, Belgian minister of state, and
to Mme. Vandervelde, who had be
come interested in our efforts to aid
in a personal and direct day, the
Belgian soldiers.
We were accorded military privi
leges and protection during our visit
to the Belgian front, and although re
tarded with not unmixed suspicion by
the array of detectives, Belgian,
French and English, whom we encoun
tered at Calais and Dunkerque, our
credentials and authorization were
flawless, so we met with the minimum
of difficulty. Only at Dunkerque, up
on a second visit to La Panne, of
which I shall speak later, the English
detective called us again from bur
railway carriage. "I am sure it Is all
right," he said, as he again scanned
our papers, "only it is so unprecedent
ed that I am simply unable to under
stand it." He had previously told us
that absolutely no civilians were trav­

eling to La Panne, "so why we?" Al
so when we returned, after a twelve
days' stay, upon onr first visit, the
Calair representative of Scotland yard,
fairly stared at us. "Tell me how you
do it," he finally managed to get out.
But thereby also hhngs a tale which
you shall learn later. But the real
reason for our exn*aordinary privi
leges, lay in the fact that we loved the
Belgian soldier, and that fact could
not be hid. But how wonderful has
been our recompense!
When Mme. Vandervelde telephoned
for me to meet her In her office in
London, telling me she had some good
news for us, I dared scarcely believe
it was actually permission to go to the
front. But when she imparted herself
the good news, and I knew there was
no mistake about it, the first thought
that came was of the joy it would Uge
our fifty or more "sons of the war."
So post haste, fifty letters were got
ten off to the boys at the front saying
that between March 1st and 15th their
"parents' would be at La Panne and
that we should expect a visit from
each one. We knew that while a boy
might not be able td get a conge for
England or France, yet that it was a
comparatively simple matter for him
to secure a day or so permission to
visit La Panne, which was only a mat
ter of a few miles from any part of
the Belgian front.
When we reached
La
Panne, we
found the hotel room, for which we
had written, awaiting us. We were
secretly uneasy aa to accommoda
tions, for we knew La Panne was not
existing for civilians these days, but
only for the military. But when we
arrived we found ourselvee expected—
yes and desired as wel. Thelandlady
of the "TerLinck*- exclaimed when
we announced ourselves, "Oh Monsieur
and Madame, you have then really ar

gian soldiers, Tyben we emerged on
the street or walked up the prome
nade, it wcut the same thing—soldiers
everywhore. It made one feel as
though all the soldiers in the Belgian
army were in La Pa&ne. Civilians
were conspicuous by their absence. We
were the cynosure of all eyes. We
were soon caught into the friendly
camaradeie of the place we met the
soldiers' half-curious friendliness
more than half way.
Walking down the street we encoun
tered a soldier carrying a little pall
containing his smoking dinner. He
called out something as we passed.
What he said was, "Have some of my
'monkey meat?'" But we sampled
some of the 'monkey meat' one day,
and found it very good indeed, as were
the potatoes whioh accompanied it.
Really appetizing and good, we
adjudged it, and took a second mouth
ful on the point of the soldiers' fork
to the very great delight of the sol
dier himself, and a cirlce of highly in
terested onlookers. Then farther along
the street we found the camp kitchen,
from which the savor dinners were
being ladled out to the soldiers awit
ing with their ready pails. We stop
ped our walk to watch the perform
ance, and to exchange some words
with the group of soldiers gathered
there.
Then on to the Hospital de l'Ocean,
once La Panne's largest hotel, now a
wonderfully equipped and staffed hos
pital. We were taken to see wonderful
pictures of maimed soldiers' bodies,
repaired and made almost as good as
new. We saw many of the soldiers
themselves, some with indescribably
terrible head wounds, yet made by aid
of surgeon and dentist, quite present
able again. We were shown many re
markable apparatuses for the reviv
ing and upbuilding of the poor unfortu
nates, and rejoiced that our brave Bel
gian soldiers should have a place such
as this in which to have repaired the
ravages of war.
We had not been many hours in La
Panne before we became accustomed
to the whir of the aeroplanes. French
and Belgian, overhead. But what fas
cinated us was toVatch aerial war
fare. To see the shrapnel bursting in
th© air, fading from balls o, flame in
to tuffs of white cloud, then turning
into black blotches in the sky. And
we could not get over the wonder of
seeing how the aeroplanes all unafraid,
flitted to and fro, with no fear evi
dently of enemy guns. Six, eight, ten
and more we could count at avtime,
reconoitering guarding little T-a
Panne, .and the king and queen of the
Belgians. At night from the inky
blackness of the beach, we could see
flare up the "star lights" from the
battlefield. During our stay in La
Panne, we never tired of walking
abroad and encountering the sol
diers seeiqg how they lived in tne de
served villas where were their quar
ters watching them drill .watching
them play, meeting and talking with
them, getting to know tomething more
each day of the real heart of the Bel
gian soldier.

Harry was working with the house

was moving a schoolhouse just west of
Greeley, and as the building was be

heavy cable became unfastened and
the heavy hook struck the young man
on the forehead just over the right
eye. The force of the blow inflicted
an ugly flesh wound, and injured the
bones over the eye. At first it was
feared that the sight had been de

not injured. It will be remembered
