academy and graded school iuesday,
next. The teaching corps is made up
of experienced and successful teachers
and the equipment both of giades and
the high school and special work is
unequalled in Orleans county. Espe
cially .may this be said of the teacher
training department at the head of
which is Miss Mary Patrick, acknowl
edged as the leading teacher training
specialist of the state. Miss Patrick
will have an assistant in Miss Pier
pont, whose ability and experience
prove her to be a teacher of marked
success. Few training classes have
the advantages, equipment and oppor
tunity for practice teaching that is
afforded here. Contemplative teach
ers should not fail to understand the
opportunity offered them, without
tuition at the Barton academy training
class.
The high school will afford greater
advantages than ever before in the
addition to the teaching force of a
fourth assistant. The work here is
bound to be above the average.
Everyone will welcome the opening
of school and the knowledge that. the
pupils and teachers are once more
among us.

FAIR HAS BIG OPENING
Large Crowd Today. Fine Local Stock
Exhibit. Exciting Ball Game. FloralJ
Hall Crowded.
The annual Orleans County fair
opened auspiciously yesterday with a
fine list of entries from the farmers of

completed yesterday in all depart
ments, especial interest centering in
the judging of the live stock by An
drew Elliot, an expert judge from
Ontario.
The exhibit of fancy work in the
floral hall and other floral hall exhibits
are all they have ever been and in most
cases better.
The crowd today was much larger
than for several years. The races,
which are in progress as the Monitor
goes to press are proving exciting and
the ball game this forenoon was a
battle royal between North Troy and
Lyndonville.
Everything is favorable for another
big day tomorrow.

Special Session To-.nos row.
After a conference with members of
the relief commiitee appointed by Gov.
Gates to investigate the needs of the
familie?? of National guards now on
duty in Texas, a special session of the
Vermont legislature was called in tht
fcllowing proclamation:
Whereas tbe Vermont troops are now
serving with the. United States army
to preserve and maintain peace and
protect our citizens on the Mexican
border,
Whereas such service is being will
ingly and patriotically performed by
our men at a sacrifice to personal
interest and duty to family and home,
Whereas it appears that the compen
sation received by these men is not
sufficient to meet their needs and the
needs of their families and that if
provision is not soon made such fami
lies must becomes subject to charity,
Therefore, I, Charles W. Gates, gov
ernor of the state of Vermont, do here
by by authority of the constitution in
this respect summon the members of
the senate and house of representatives
to meet in their respective chambers
together with the officers of the two
houses on the 24th day of August, A.
D. 1916, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon
to provide for such compensation of
Vermont troops in addition to United
States pay and for such relief of their
families and dependents as may seem
advisable.

illness of Mr. Austin's son, Chandler,
while en route to Moose Jaw. Canada.
! for his vacation. Mr. Austin and son
are at Saskatoon, Canada. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Austin, nee Flora Whitney,
were former Barton residents.
If you have not already done so,
you should visit the manual training
booth in floral hall at the Barton fair,
which is in charge of Prof. Bates.
Surely the boys of the academy are
exhibiting some very creditable work
in this line and the booth is one of the
most attractive features of the fair.
Mrs. Elizabeth Pearson Keniston of
North Reading, Mass., has been spend
ing a few days with her cousins, Miss
Clara and John Barnard. Mrs. Kenis
ton was the daughter of the Rev. Ora
Pearson and formerly resided in a

Hotel Barton. She will be remem
bered by some of Barton's older resi
dents. During band concert Saturday night,
burglars attempted to enter the Lang
bouse, occupied by N. C. Stevens.
Coming on the porch the party broke
out a large light of glass and then
unlatching the sash shoved it up, but
the Stevens dog then became the
aggressor and evidently the burglar
decided that the house was too well
protected and beat a retreat.

ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
Young Man Said to Have Quarreled
with His Sweetheart. In Hospital
but Will Live.
Walter Simpson, a young man living
about seven miles from Barton on the
Duck pond road to Sheffield was found
suffering from a 32 caliber revolver
shot in his right shoulder about 9
o'clock last night near Frank Tou
chette's in!the south part of'the village.
It appears that young Simpson wanted
to get.Touchette's team but not doing
so went out into the street and it is
supposed he tried to shoot himself,
although some circumstances are
peculiar.
F. R. Hastings, the attending physi
cian, says the revolver was fired so
close to the shoulder in which the
bullet found lodgment that the flesh
and clothing were discolored by the
powder, and the injury was in the
right shoulder.
Simpson was taken to St Johnsbury
on the midnight train, accompanied by
his brother, where he entered the hos
pital and was operated upon by Dr.
Allen. He will recover.
It is reported that the young man
had quarreled with bis sweetheart.

California Subscriber Writes Interestingly
Salinas, Calif., Aug. 7th, 1916.
Mr. Editor:
As my subscription for the Orleans
County Monitor expires sometime this
month, please find enclosed postoffice
money order of $1.50 for the Monitor
another year. The Monitor is a very
welcome weekly visitor here, and I
don't thinktl can get along without it,
on account of the home .news I get in
it for Barton seems more like home
to me than any other place. Perhaps
you would like to know that when my
paper has come 3000 miles to me and I
have devoured all the news,- then I
send it to my daughter in New York
City, where it gets another warm
welcome. Each copy has a 6,000-mile
ride. I am living in the Salinas
Valley, and there has been very little
rain here since last March and of
course it is very dry. We are having
a great deal of fog now. I was sur
prised yesterday by an earthquake that
threw some of the household utensils
off the shelves and a pan of milk went
over, too. It was the hardest earth
quake there has been since I came to
California.
The crops in this vicinity are all
harvested excepting the sugar beets.
The Spreckles Sugar (beet) Factory
is about five miles from here and is
the largest factory of its kind in the
United States.
There are a great many men here
looking for work (they say) and asking
for food. Since I came here in Janu
ary there. have been as many as 57 men
coming to the door and either asking for
work or food, or both. Most of them
carry what is called here a blanket
roll, on their backs.

PLATTSBURGH MILITARY
TRAINING CAMPS.
(At the request of the Monitor,
Principal F.Jay Bates prepared the
following regarding the Plattsburgh
military training camp.)
In any discussion of the life at the
Plattsburgh military training camps
at Plattsburgh, N. Y., it is well to
keep in mind how the camps came into
existence and what the objects the war
department has in mind in carrying on
the work. Now that the camps have
passed beyond the experimental stage
and have become established as a per-
manent feature of our military policy,
I it behooves every one of us who consid-
zen to inquire into tbe significance'of
this novel scheme of our goYemment's
preparedness scheme.
In June, 1915, a movement was start
ed among the younger professional and
business men and resulted in the
Plattsburgh training camp for business
and professional men of 1915, with an
attendance of 1800 men. Like the stu
dent camps, these camps had the
approval of the war department and
were supervised by . regular army
officers and in conjunction with troops
of the regular army. Owing to the
marked success of the 1915 camps,
plans were made for sectional camps
on a large scale for the present sum
mer. There will be five camps this
summer, the first began June 5 and
ran until July 2, tbe last will run for a
month and close October 5. Present
indications re that at least 30,000 will
attend these camps this summer.
The objects of these camps are : (1)
to train properly, as far as time will
i permit, qualified men to become avail
able as commissioned officers in case
of national emergency ; (2) to fester a
patriotic spirit, and to disseminate
among our citizens some knowledge of
military history, policy and needs; (3)
to instill in the recruit the habits of
obedience, discipline, command and
self-control that are essential to busi
ness efficiency, and to send men back
home properly equipped to meet any
responsibility.

Maple Sugar Appreciated.
Columbus, New Mexico,
Aug. 12, 1916.
Editor Oileans County r.'cnitor,
Dear Sir:
A little incident occurred today
which made me think of the days that
I spent in Barton. A party in Ran
dolph sent to each of the men in the
Mass. Nat'l Guard,-who were born in
Vermont a pound box of maple sugar
which I am sure brought to the minds
of all of us memories of the sugar
places of Vermont, where no doubt
all of us have indulged to the full
satisiaction of our appetites in that
dainty for which Vermont is justly
famous. The 2d Mass. Reet. of the
Nat'l Guard, of which I am a member is
stationed at Columbus, N. M., which
is the base for Gen. Pershing's expedi
tion into Mexico. Our camp is about
two miles from the border and we can
see from here mountains 75 or 100
miles south in Mexico. The- climate
here is far from being as agreeable as
the summers in Vermont, as the tem
perature gets up to 120 degrees
occasionally and is at least 90 degrees
every day. The heat, however, is not
hard to bear because of the altitude,
which is 4063 feet above sea level.
The country surrounding us is a nearly
flat sandy plain covered with grease
wood and cactus while horned toads,
lizards, jack rabbits and rattlesnakes
are almost the only inhabitants. The
nights are quite cool, blankets being
necessary at night and a breeze blow
ing nearly all the time. Now is the
rainy season wmcn lasts out a iew
weeks and then there is no more until
the next year. There is practically no
agriculture carried on here except for
a few ranches scattered miles apart.
Crops must be irrigated and all
water ccmes from driven wells. From
a mountain six miles to the north we
can see a Jake down in Mexico but we
can not eo boating as we are not
allowed to cross the border.
Will say just a word as to our daily
routine. We rise at 5.30 a. m., set
ting up drill or monkey drill ; 6 a. m.,
mess call ; 6,30, police call to clean up
t ho nnmnarw ci root T 9ft r 11 9ft
drill and instruction; 12, mess; 12 to 3,
at liberty ; 3 till 4, bayonet drill ; 4
till 5, at liberty; 5, mess, 5.50 retreat;
6.30 till 11, at liberty.
Sundays we are free all day except
that we must attend church.
I thought that perhaps this might be
of interest to you and your readers if
yea care to print it and at the ssme
time let my old friends in Barton know
wbfcie I am. I would be very much
pleased to hear from any of my Barton
friends. My address is Neal M. Lewis,
I Co., 2d Regt. Mass. Inf., Nat'l
Guard, Columbus, New Mexico.
Respectfully yours,
Neal M. Lewis.
