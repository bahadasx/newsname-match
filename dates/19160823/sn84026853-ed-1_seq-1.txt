Tan|l??Some Reason for Hope of
Amicable Settlement Appears.
Washington, Aug. 21.? As one
American citizen to another, President
Wilson today appealed to each
of the executives of the country's
principal railroads on grounds of patriotism
to accept his plans for averting
the theatened disaster of a na- j
tionwide strike. He emphasized the
necessity for keeping the railroads
in service as a part of the national
defense, and to .make possible preparation*
for meeting conditions that
will exist after the European war;
On leaving the White Houpe .the
railroad presidents, augmented during*
the day by arrivals from the
Wept, held a conference . & which
sentiment was said to be against
agreeing to the president'p proposal
in its present form. Hope was exposed,
however, that some satisfactory
counterproposition might be ad-1
. vtiiced, and it was decided to turn
v o#r to a committee the task of drafting
a final reply to the president
W$ch more than 60 men, most of.
tkem with their own ideas about what
ought to be done, the executives
found it difficult to "get down to
bnfa tarks," as one of them expresse4
it V-morow another meeting mil

by the greater issue; Shall

of industrial disputes?"
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to take
~ whatever action the people of the
country desire. t
officials were listening to I
President Wilson and later conferring
at their hotel, the general committee
of 640 representatives of the
employes, who' already have accepted
the president's plan, held a perfunctory
meeting and marked time
awaiting the decision of the employers.
They said they would'wait until
President Wilson dismissed them, but
stood ready to call a strike should the
negotiations fail.
EXCURSION DATE IS FIXED
Ftmtri to Go to Knozrlllo on September
the 4th.
The date of the Educational Tour
to Knoxville, Tenn., has been de
, finitely fixed. The excursion train
-will leave Anderson at 7 o'clock MonHav

roundtrip fare will be $4.75 with
privileges of stopping over at any or
all stations. A pullman car will be
attached to the train for persons who
care for this additional service.
The tour was scheduled to be made
on August 8th, but the floods in the
mountains caused the Southern railway
to make a ehange in the date;
Ancnst 21st was the date tentatively
agreed upon. Later it developed,
however, that the annual Seashore
Mountain excursions will be run
during the week of the 21st, and for
this reason the date has been changed
and September 4th has been decided
upon.
"September 4th is the date the excursion
will leave Anderson. This is
final," declared Sectary Fitsgerald
today. "The advertising matter for
the tour will arrive her<e probably torn
nrrnw"
The excursion train really originates
at Newberry. The train will
leave Newberry at 6 a. m. Monday
morning and will merge with the
Anderson train at Belton. This merged
train will be operated all the way
through to Knoxville. Some of the
farmers have expressed a desire to
stop over at Newport, Tenn. Those
-who care to make the stop over will
occupy one car ana tnis car will De
dropped at Newport, to be picked up
by a regular train next day.

DEATH OF>
MRS. L C.
HASKELL
I
Mrs. Langdon Cheves Haskell died
at her home on Grenville street last
Thursday, August 17th, 1916, at mid
day.
Some weeks ago Mrs. Haskell went
out west where she visited friends
and relatives, here she was taken
sick and come home, since which time
many anixous inquiries have been
heard as to her welfare. She was
taken to Baltimore and treated there
for several weeks, but all that loving
thought and medical science was of
no avail for the time of her departure
had come. She went to her reward
without fear and in peace.
Mrs. Haskell was tne oldest child
of Sarah Tilman and E. B. Calhoun
and was born at Monterey Nov. 8th,
1861. She lived here until her marriage
on Jany. 12, 1887, to Mr. L. C.
Haskell. To this happy union were
born the following children, Ella.
Calhoun,' Langdon, Sarah, Kate and
Allen. .In 1898 Mr. and Mrs. Haskell
moved from the Haskell place in
the Monterey section to Abbeville,
and have since made their home
among us. v
Mrs. Haskell had long been a member
of the Presbyterian church, and
it was here that funeral services were
held Friday afternoon at five o'clock
conducted by Rev. H. W. Pratt, and
in the presence of a host of sorowing
friends and relatives. Messrs.
S. J. Link, J. L. Perrin, J. S. Stark.
James Bowie, and T. G. White acted
as pall bearers and the casket was
followed by the family, her relations
and her neighbors. The interment
was at Long Cane cemetery.
Mrs. Haskell led a quiet life, believing
that home keeping hearts are
happiest. She was supreme in the affections
of her husband and children
and she made for them a home bright
and beautiful in its happiness. Her
pride was in her children and she was
repaid in that all are taking up the
burdens of liCe in an honorable way
and are doing well their part in the
world. v
Mrs. Haskell was a lover of flowers
and the beauty of her homo showed
the painstaking care that she had
expended on her place.
Many beautiful floral offerings
were sent to the home attesting the
high esteem in which Mrs. Haskell
Was held and the sincere sympathy
f.n it.. j * ii_

Mrs. Haskell is survived by her
husband and her six children, her
father, Mr. E. B. Calhoun, and her
sisters, Miss Frances, Miss Lallie,
Miss Eunice, and Miss Ivy Calhoun,
and Messrs John, Arthur and Charlie
Calhoun, her brothers. .

; : ? i:; i:?
5 Washington, Aug. IS.?Without in
the least "stretching the blanket,"
' reports received in Washington from
5 different parts of the United States
t indicate the reelection of Woodrovi
5 Wilson and the continuation of the
. Democratic party in power, for foui
years more. r .
* These reports indicate that not on5
ly will Wilson remain in the White
} House, but that Republican leaden
. are beginning to realize that there if
' a very different man in Justice Charles
Evans Hughes of the United
5 States supreme court and the same
J man as a candidate for the presiden3
6y. iWr idol, is shattered.
, As oppofeed to this, Democratic
leaders are most optimistic as^to the
1 resdlt this fall. . It
is evident from the way thej
b talk that the whole country will gc
r Democratic this fall and that Mr.
b Hughes has failed utterly. If the Republicans
get a single State they wfll
! be lucky. -Some of the Democratic

National Committeeman Dock
weller of California, a new member
of the committee, and jSavin McNabb,
the California member of the
1 campaign committee, t4ld their col.
leagues that California is likely to go
' Democratic.
, "It looks like it will be the 1912
fight over again in California," said
Mr. Dockweiler. "The result in the
States for the national ticket will depend
largely upon the ' outcome of
the senatorial fight," said Mr. Dockweiler.
"Frank Henev has with
drawn from the contest for the Democratic
nomination, leaving George
S. Patton a free field. Mr. Patton
is one of the strong men of the Pacific
coast. The regular Republicans
i want Willis Booth as their candidate
for senator, but Gov. Hiram Johnson
who is< going to run for the Senate
also, wants the Republicans as well
| .as the Progressives to nominate him.
I do not think the Republicans will
listen to such a plan; certainly Booth
. will not get out of the race, and if
he gets the Republican nomination,
! i as he probably will, Johnson will hav?
to run independently as a Progres,
