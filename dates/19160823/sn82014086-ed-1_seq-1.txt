Filed In the United States District
Court at Boston Yesterday.
Boston, Aug. 22. Receivership for
the Boston and Maine railroad, which
operates in the four northern New
England states and Canada, was ask
ed for in a bill in equity filed in the
United Stites district court here, to
day. This action, in which the Inter
continental Rubber company of New
Jersey which holds a not" of the road
for J51,0CK) appears a.i the petitioner,
was taken -with the cons nt of the di
rectors of the Boston and .Maine, it is
understood. No official statement on
this phaae of the mutter could be ob
tained, but ono of the directors said
it was a friendly proceeding, intended
to simplify the task of srai .-bcening
cut the read's financial tangle.
The board of directors, which for
two years has been trying to effect a
reorganization of the system, was in
session today to consider its proce
dure in connection with $13,500,000 of
Indebtedness falpng due on Aug. SI.
Most of these obligations had been ex
tended from rime to time whiie await
ing the outcome of plans for reorgani
zation. After a long mee'lng, the di
rectors decided they had "reached the
end of their rope" in the words of one
of their number, and issued the fol
lowing statement through President J.
H. Hustle:
"In the opinion of the directors of
the Boston and .Msine railroad it is
Inexpedient to attempt a further re
newal of the notes fulling due Aug
ust 31st. A creditors' petition for a
receiver has been filed in the I'nited
States district court and in due time
the Boston and Maine will file its an
swer thereto."
This answer, it was intimated to
night, would be made within a week.
Whether any incidental action would
develop meantime was uncertain, al
though indications were rot lacking

Interested had virtually decided to
jontest a proposal of receivership.

Importance on the French section of

For several days the Russian re
ports in regard to the situation on the
eastern front have been very meagre
and Petrograd has insisted that noth
ing of importance has occurred in that
theatre. Berlin, however, describes
very heavy fighting in progress both
on the Stokhofl and in the passes of
the Carpathians. An interesting fea
ture of the Russian official statement
is the intimation that the Grand Duke
Nicholas is once again pressing his

sized the fighting around Diarbekr but
no important change in the situation

SENATE DESATES $205,000,000
EMERGENCY REVENUE BILL
Figures Submitted to Disprove Repub
lican Charge of Democratic Extrav
agance. Washington, Aug. 22. With Senator
Simmons, chairman of the finance
committee, submitting figures design
ed to disprove republican charges of
democratic extravagance and Senator
Smoot, republican finance expert, as
serting that the democratic party
should be convicted of attempting to
procure votes under false pretenses,
general debate on the $205,000,000
emergency revenue bill began today in
the senate. There were indications on
every hand of a partisan battle royal
to be waged for several days.
Insisting that national defense pre
paredness and the Mexican situation
were altogether responsible for the
necessity of special revenue legislation
and a proposed bond issue, Senator
Simmons declared republicans in con
gress had clamored for even greater
expenditures for defense, and, having
done this, were seeking partisan ad
vantage by making false charges of
democratic extravagance to the pub
lic. Senator Smoot, opening the repub
lican assault on the revenue bill, said
if the democratic party were to be
retained in control of the government,
tho country would "suffer an era of
unequalled extravagance combined
with inefficiency unsurpassed." His
attack was supported by Senator Cur
tis, who asserted that the burden of
taxation should not be placed on the
American people and that revenues
should be raised by a protective tar
iff. To prove his contention that normal
appropriations of this session are not
excessive. Senator Simmons submit
ted treasury department estimates for
the year 1917, showing that, exclud
ing postal appropriations, bond issues
already authorized and amounts that
will not be expended, revenues must
be provided for disbursements of $1,
126,243,000. Of this amount the total,
appropriated for national defense
would aggregate about $654,000,000 and
the senator submitted other figures to
proe that this extraordinary amount,
due to preparedness and the Mexican
emergency, exceeded normal defense
appropriations by about $372,280,000.

EXTENSIVE CELEBRATION
OPENING PHASE OF
NAVAL WAR GAME.
Two Mighty Fleets Aro Manoeuvring
Off the Atlantio Coast.
Wasihngton, Aug. 22. Two mighty
fleets were grappling for each other in
the dark tonl;nt somewhere oi the
Atlantic coast, in the opening phase of
the most elaborate war kame ever un
dertaken by the American navy. The
navy department, on a war footing-, was
invoking every agency to aid Rear Ad
miral Helm, commanding the "blue"
defending lieet, which was sweeping
seaward behind a line Of scouts nearly
bUO miles long, to repulse Admiral
Mayo '6 "red" battie fleet.
The game began at 6 o'clock this
morning when Admiral Heim on his
nagship, the Rhode Island, received
word that an agent of the state de
partment aboard a ship bound from
New xork to Gibraltar had reported
15 battleships of the "red" fleet COO
miles due east of Cape Hatteray, with
30 transports bringing an army of in
vasion to be landed somewhere be
tween Cape Hatteras and ilusiport. Me.
An hour after the report came the 12
battleships of Admiral Helm's main
fighting fleet, manned in part by civil
ian volunteers and naval militiamen,
were headed seaward from Xarragan
sett. Ahead of them were speeding
nearly a score of swift destroyers and
a cruiser squadron. Rear Admiral
Gleaves commands the scouting- force,
which is converging on the point where
the enemy was known to be at day
light this morning. Admiral Mayo's
problem is to force a way through the
"blue" fieet for his transports. The
board within which operations must ue
confined is virtually 500 miles square,
and with the active battleships of the
Atlantic fleet as his main fighting fleet
Admiral Mayo controls a force that
Admiral He'm must employ strategy
to defeat. Rear Admiral Knight, he-ad
of the navy war college, is umpiring
the game from the battleship Penn
sylvania, The radio signals from the enemy
fleet mean nothing to the operators on
Admiral Gleaves' scouting ships. The
messages are in a cipher code known
only to the officers and men of the
"red" fleet. Those picked up tonight
by "blue" scouts, however, were sent
back through radio relay ships to the
navy department, where code experts
struggle dover them through the night
seeking the key to the cipher.
By the terms of the problem, pre
pared at the naval war college, the
"red" commander has until Sept. 1 to
effete a landing.

the tribunal wi1 rule in favor of the
men voting for all officers.

About Accepting Plan Drafted by President Wilson
to Avert Strike of Trainmen

Railroad Magnates are Insistent on Arbitration of the Eight
Hour Day and All Other Issues With Their Employes
Three of the Committeemen Spent an Hour at the White'
House Last Night, But Declined to Talk About Theip
Visit 600 Representatives of Brotherhoods Show Feel
ing of Restlessness General Feeling Prevails That a
Definite Answer to President Wilson's Demands Can-'
not Be Much Longer Postponed.
Washington, Aug. 22. Right presi
dents of important railway systems
who have been designated to draft
the railroads' reply to President Wil
son's appeal that they accept his plan
for averting a nation-wide strike, were
in almost continuous session today
and tonight without solving the prob
lem. '
Late tonight three of the committee
men, Hale Holden, of the Burlington;
R. S. Lovett of the Union Pacific and
Daniel AVillard of the Baltimore and
Ohio, discussed the situation with
President Wilson. They were at the
White House more than an hour and
on leaving declined to talk about their
visit, further than to say they had
asked for the conference to "discuss
the general situation" and expected to
see the president again.
Prolonging Negotiations.
Although some of the sixty or more
presidents are showing a disposition
to prolong the negotiations in the
hope that the sentiment of business
men of the country will be shown to
be opposed to the idea of an eight
hour day, there was a general feeling
tonight that a definite answer to Pres
ident Wilson's demand cannot be
much longer postponed. The .presi
dent is understood to have indicated
that he desired his proposals to be
fully debated by the executives, but
their conferences among themselves
have failed so far to develop any con
crete plan likely to win approval.
Insist on Arbitration.
So far as the railroad presidents
would discuss the situation tonight,
they still are insistent on arbitration
of the eight-hour day and all other
issues with the employes. As the con
ferences continued there was less talk
of action which would lead to a strike,
but some of the executives are ex
pected to fight to the last ditch any

their appointments, the Mexican mem
bers were name dsome time ago and
arrangements for their meeting will
be made immediately hy Secretary
Lansing and Fliseo Arredondo, General
Carranza's ambassador-designate. Vir
tually the only question to be decided
is where the session shall be held. The
Mexicans are understood to prefer
some resort on the Xew Jersey coast.
Secretary Lane, who will head the
American group, was the first member
selected. Associate Justice Brandeis
was President Wilson's second choice,
but after a conference with Chief Jus
tice White he decided his duties would
not permit him to serve. Judge Gray,
a retired federal circuit judge and a
former "United States senator, has had
much experience on international
bodies and since 1300 has been a mem
ber of the international permanent
court of arbitration under The Hague
convention. Dr. Mott is general sec
retary of the international committee
of the Young Men's Christian associa
tion and author of numerous religious

SESSION DAY AND NIGHT
plan which would force an eight hour
day on the roads without some form
of arbitration.
It was understood the White Htrasa

tives wished to get President Wilson's

ter so that they could be outlined to
the rest of the committee tomorrow

out with some concessions.
Feeling of Restlessness Among Em-i
ployes. 1
Among the more than 600 represen-j
tatives of the railroad tjrotherhoods in!
Washington there was evident todayi
a feeling of restlessness and therej
were many inquiries of leaders as toj
how long they must remain. It is no
expected that this feeling will lead tO
any open revolt unless the conference
between President Wilson and the ex-j
ecutives are prolonged. Some of tho
leaders told inquirers today that they
would not have to stay in Washington'
more than forty-eight hours.
The railroad executives who are,
counting on winning the president to
their position in the negotiations say
that the case after all. is to be decided
by public opinion and that this will be
found to support .arbitration and con
demn the eight hour dap. These made
public tonight several telegrams from
commercial organizations throughout
the country upholding arbitration for
the settlement of labor disputes and
opposing an eight hour day such aa
the employes desire.
The cabinet discussed the situation
at today's meeting and 1 nthe opinion
of some of the members the dangers
cf a strike have been greatly lessened.
AN APPEAL MADE
TO CATHOLIC VOTERS
At Mass Meeting of German Roman
Catholic Verein.
Xew York, Aug. 22. Catholic votera
throughout the United States were
urged, at a mass meeting of the Ger
man Roman Catholic Central Verein
here tonight, to unite and cast their
influence at the polls "where it will
best subserve the high and holy prin-J
cipies" for which Catholics stand.
James F. Zipf, president of the Gon
aaga .Union of St. Louis, Mo., who
made the appeal, declared there were
at least 3.000,01)0 Catholic voters in tho
country "quite a force,'-" he said, "for
the bringing about of proper condi
tions." "That," Mr. Zipf added, "is almost
as many votes as the republican party
polled at the last general election. That
very number places in our hands a
power to be used in works of social
civic betterment, in works of mercy
and of peace. When the Catholic arm
is uplifted let it be for construction
always, but never for destruction."
Mr. Zipf asserted he was not pon
tending for a religious party, but for
an organization of Catholics to "brinjr
into public life a spirit of liberty and
toleration."
"We must be so organized." he de
clared, "and under such leadership
that upon occasions we speak forcibly
as one man and say to the Black Hand
of religious intoleration, hypocrisy and
hatred, 'Thou shalt not enter here, so
far shalt thou go and no further.' "
A resolution demanding at the end
of the world war the pope "be heard
in the council of the nations for the
securing and cementing of a perma-.
nent peace," was passed by the Amer
ican Federation of Catholic Societies
at its convention.
