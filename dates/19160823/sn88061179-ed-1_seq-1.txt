ply Ample
hould Not Be Relied On,
Hoard Says, To Take
Place of Sanitation.
Itibhnioud, Va., Aug. 18.?
ollowing rush ordern that ox
?URted us supply of typhoid
?fine daily, tho Statt: Hoard
f Health has now more than
alight up with the demand
I hopes to lie able to 1:11 fn
? demands for tho vaccine
ritliout delay. The manufac
irors who supply tho prevou
'reare forwarding shipments
?gulurly and believe they will
a able to meet all calls made
n them.
In advising the use of typhoid
acciue where there is danger
f infection, the State Hoard of
calth today cautioned the
ublic against relying on the
acciiie to take the place of
unitary precautions. The vac
iuo, according to the board,
ireciably increase one's re
{Stance to typhoid but nothing
ill give absolute protection
xcopl the rigid observance of
ho proper safeguards.
"The elfects of the typhoid
areine,'* said an oflicer of the
ioard today, "is to increase the
lOdily resistance to typhoid.
This effect is cumulative for
liirty days after the lirst injec
imi of the vaccine and then re
naitis constant for a period
arinusly estimated at about
liri'i' years. The result is that
In: vaccinated person is irri*
nuno to tho ordinary dangers
>f infection. Hut there may
eadily come times when a per
011 receives into the body more
grills of typhoid than he can
throw off, even with the assist?
ance of the vaccino. While
this 'ha s not happen very i>f
len, no person should think
that typhoid vaccination gives
lit in license to take unlimited
?liunces. Vaccination must be
accompanied by a regard for
general sanitation.

J. A. L. Minor.
James A. L. -Minor miexpect-j
uilly expired at Iiis residence '
yesterday afternoon at 4:16
o'clock, ft?m acute indigestion.
Ho hud partaken of u late din?
ner at his home, appeured to be
feeling quite well, then grew
ill, and before the arrival of a
physician who was quickly
summoi _>d, be h n d ex?
pired. The news of Ids'passing
away was at first received with
incredulity by bis hundreds of
friends, as ho had been about
the city during the week, look?
ing well, anil on Friday night
accompanied Mrs. Minor to a
public entertainment. Mr.
Minor left his wife, one brother,
John Minor, of Knsley, Ala.,
and one sister, Mrs. Tilly Me?
dium, of ?ig Stone (lap, Va.
The funeral probably will take
place on Tuesday, the time de?
pending on when his brother
and sister can reach I he city.
His religious afliliation was
with the Presbyterian Church
of the Covenant, and he was a
member of the Masonic fratern?
ity, belonging to lodge No. 100,
Free and Accepted Masons, a
Knight Templar, a member of
Williamsport consistory, Scot
tish Kile, and a member of the
Howard club.
James -V. h. Minor was born
j:i years ago at Connollvillo.
lie was a retired contractor.
His father was a general con?
tractor and set the boy lo learn
the trades of stonemason, brick?
layer and stone culler, prelimi?
nary to introducing huh into
the manufacturing and con?
tracting world. He soon en?
gaged in work on his own re?
sponsibility, ami did a general
contracting and railroad con?
struction business in the central
part of this state anil elsewhere.
He was superintendent for tho
Westmoreland Coal and Coke
company for several years, at
Manor Station. Then he went
Birmingham, Ala., where bo
made his headquarters for 2D
years, carrying out contracts in
Tennessee, Kentucky Alabama
and Virginia; With his broth?
ers, Mr. Minor manufactured
the lirst street paving brick in?
troduced in Alabama, manufac?
tured lire clay products, and
was interested in banking, coal
mining and coking enterprises
for Several years, serving on
directorates of several com?
panies, lie spent his life doing
work on a large scale, and of a
kind where the knowledge he
gained found constant applica?
tion in many kinds of the most
important departments of city
government.
In the early fall of 1013 Mr.
Minor became a candidate for
council at the lirst. primary to
he hold under the Clark law.
He was nominated, and in No?
vember elected. When the
superintendence's were dis?
tributed among the members of
the council, that organized at
the beginning of December, 1913,1
for a term of two years and I
one month, he was assigned the.
most difficult and exacting
position, that of superintendent
of streets. He brought lo this
place ripe experience, intelli?
gent direction, great industry,
and possibly quite as important,
a degree of self-reliance and in?
dependence and good nature
that made him in a short lime
complete master of the situa?
tion. Ho was one of tho most
active members of the council
during his term, and his in?
fluence was large throughout
his term.?Williamsport, (Pa.)

Belief.
Richmond, Aug- IC.?Before
leaving for New York" Gover?
nor ll. ?. Stuart gavo out this
statement on the situation in
the Ninth district:
"With the drift of sentiment
towards Wilson in every part
of the country, and with the
democrats of tho Ninth district
aroused, there is good reason to
bolieve that Senator Trinkle
will be elected in Novembor.
There is great interest iu the
mutter, and Senator Trinklo is
a man who is popular, strong,
and knows the people of that
section. Thoy have great con?
fidence in him."
FamilyReunion
A memorable event in tlie
history of Turkey Cove wok tlio
family reunion at tho homo of
J. B. Skeen on Sunday, August
120 th, iu lionor of the 92nd birth?
day of his father, George Cow?
an Skeen, still a hale and
hearty patriarch looking for?
ward confidently to rounding
tho century mark.
A happy idea, beautifully car?
ried out, was that each family
represented should bring a bas?
ket of good things to eat. Cars
began to arrive early and
groups of relatives gathered
tinder the shade of the trees on
Mr. Skeen's spacious lawn to
greet each other and to wish
tho venerable head of the house
of Skeen many happy returns.
At one o'clock dinner was
spread picnic-fashion on the
ground and after grace by Mr.
Skeen, everybody sat around
on the grass and ate with the
keenest enjoyment of the good
things from the baskets, not
forgettinx a piece of birthday
cake linked for her grandfather
by Miss Mary Skeen, of the
< lap.
No child over enjoyed a par?
ty more than did Mr. Skeen,
looking around on children,
grandchildren and great-grand?
children gathered together to
commemorate Ins birthday.
A number of relatives wore
pre von ted from coming by ill?
ness, and Carlisle Skeen is with
the soldier boys on the bonier,
but the roll call of those pres?
ent wan as follows:
(leorge Cowan Bkeeu; Mr.
ami Mrs. .lames B. Skeen; Mrs.
James T?te; Mrs. Sarah Cilly;
Mr. and Mrs. John Stewart:
M iss (larollno Skeen; ,1 lid go and

Mrs. Bruce S. Moore and chil?

Henry, Dorothy and Hetty

Mrs. J. B. Wampler and little
daughter, Sue; Mrs. Branch

Mitfor.l I lilly; Alf. Slump; John
Cilly; .Iannis Taylor; William

Milford Cilly's violin added
much to tho pleasure of the af?
ternoon, as did the singing of
Misses Mary Skeen and Kdntl
I'enniugton assisted by Mrs.
11. A. W. Skoon.
As it perfect day drew to its
close a feeling of sadness per?
vaded the good-byes. Life is
uncertain at its best, but such
reunions make red letter days
in the history of u family.

Peebles, Dante's southpaw,
pitched a no-hit game against
a team composed of players

ing kicked by a mule he and
his father was driving. Thoy
had stopped the wagon in front
of Judge Skeen's residence to

tho mule kicked tho boy, who
fell buck against the sidowulk,
which caused a concussion of
the brain and a fracture of tho
collar bone, which rendored
him unconscious. Ho was ro

Taboo Lime
In Camp
Is An Attraction For Flics
and An Inefficient Dis?
infectant For Filth.
Brownsville, Tex., Aug. is.?
Good by to tho old Bty lo of litnc
vvhitened uriny ? camps. Tho
use of lim?' was stopped in all
camps today by orders which
Major Bispham, sanitary in.
gpoctor for the army of the low
or Bio Grando, issued Monday
night. "We've discovered that
that Hies like white color," said
the major. "What we are look?
ing for is something black in
the way of a disiuscctnnt. The
latest idea is lamp black mixed
with petroleum." At the re
titlest of Major Hispham I ac?
companied him on a trip of in?
spection. "Wo want American-,
to know the exact health uml
sanitary conditions here," said
Bispham, "Many wild stories
ari' being sent out about illness
among the men. All are tin
t lie. The sanitary department
of the American army can
plomise the American public
that there is no repetition of
the horrors of l898, Uolalivos
of the soldiers .back home may
test busy and not worry." Tho
cm respondent saw many un?
ser.led kitchens in the Vir
ginin and Illinois regiments.
"We can't have screen-, until
we gel wooden kitchens",
said Bispham. "'('here in no
lumber here, but it is being
rushed tin ears attached to fast
passenger trains."
"Look hoio," and Bispham
pointi d to a ditch in the Vir?
ginia camp, "Doesn't thnt
prove lime is useless;' L'i k tit
the tlios feeding in that lime
whitened ditch. H'lios are the
best sanitary inspectors in the
world. Thoy always Und tilth
and they are proving to us now
that lime doesn't disinfect.
Tiie ideas of many incoming
guard companies tiro yqry old
fashioned in regard to sanita?
tion." In proof of this Bispham
drove his automobile to the
camp where the lirsl Iowa had
just arrived. Thousands of
huge > ouths were culling down
cactus and greasewood to tho
music of a giant course of Tex?
as locusts driven from their
homes in the falling trees.
"What are you doing thore?''
asked the inaj ?r of a superin?
tendent, who was looking after
the digging of a hole near a
kitchen. "Digging a cesspool,"
replied the sergeant. "Pleuse
discontinue that work and
bring the medical blllcer here,"
said Bispliam. Major W. s.
Couklill, of Des Meines, appear?
ed. "No cesspools, please," di?
rected Bispham. "Build in?
cinerators ami burn the refuse."
It duveloped later that many
officers in the Iowa regiment
had been in the Spanish Amer?
ican war during which cess
pools killed thousands. "No
reflection on the lowitiis," said
Bispliam. "The militia is all
the same. They don't know
the Intest theories in sanita?
tion."
