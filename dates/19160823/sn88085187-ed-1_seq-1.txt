"Fish Ain't There,"
Say the Fishermen-
Next Year Will Tell
BY MABEL ABBOTT
Is Puget Sound "fished out?"
Js it possible that the hordet of salmon that used to choke traps and break
nets have been practically exterminated)
That this possibility lias been recognised and feared, closed seasons, re
strictions on fishing, anil the establishment of government hatcheries bear wit
ness.
That it has actually come to pass is the assertion of many outfitters, fan
ners and others connected with the fish industry.
Next year—the year of the "bit;' run"—will tell the story.
The fishing boats are coming
back to Old Town, though the
. season does not end until the
2fith.
"THE FISH AIN'T THEKE,"
BAY THK FISHEH.MEN, "SO
WE COME BACK."

" atic —these and others have re
turned, and more are coming m
daily. Fifty boats lie at Old
To.vn when the fishing is over.
In about three weeks they will
go out again for the dog salmon;
but meanwhile the nets are dry
ing on the wharf, and the ..ian sit
on the shady side of the little
store, or do endless odd Jobs
about the boats.

"Oh, yes—ah-huin," you say. "Eight

around. Then, at the 11th hour, there's a
hurry call to the baseball game or some
thing.

They talked of the fishing yes
terday; of the seines that cost
$1,200 and hardly last a season;
and of the breakwater that would
save their boats from the waves
that come piling in from the
north in the winter.
Worst on Record.
Hut mostly they talked of the
fishing.
"It,* the worst 1 seen yet,"
said a in"" from the Maryland.
"We make iimyhe $.*><> a share.
Some make maybe $:1.5. That's
nothing. The llsh ain't there."
"The fellow outside the cape,
he's make some money, maybe,"
suggested another.
"Maybe three, four boat make
some money," admitted the Mary

The Olympic is one of the
boats that were outside tlie
cape; but the big fisherman who
was climbing down to her deck
paused to say;
Next Year—Maybe.
"No good this year. No fish
Maybe a few boats do pretty
well, but most don't make ex
penses. Next year's the big run
—maybe."
"I'm not make expenses,"
said Andrew Berry, as he watch
ed his men haul the seine from
the wharf and stow it In the
sturdy little "Adriatic."
"Twenty-six years I'm fishing
on the Sound. I remember 20
years ago it was awful good run
■—awful big. Sixteen years ago
good, too; 12 years ago not so
good; eight years not so good as
that; four years ago not so good
as any of those.
Next year—well, maybe next
year we have big run again, may
be not. Nobody can tell. I don't
know where the fish is gone."
Trollers Do Hetter.
Trollers have done better than
seiners, they said, a sure sign
that the fish nre scattered- The
trollers, with lines and spoons
trailing from outriggers at both
sides of the boats, catch the stray
fish that are always to be found,
while the seines are successful
only when there Is a real run.
The fishermen nre corrob
orated by local fish compan
ies, which way the run this
season is the smallest ever
known in an "off yenr," and
that if the big run does not
come next year, ru_-.it Hound

In his first address today., be
fore the Young Men's Republican
club at the Peerless Grill at noon,
Senator Poindexter said:
"A good deal has been said
about the tariff.
"The only way the tariff can
be permanently settled is by the
establishment of a tariff comn.ii
sion with power not only to in
vestigate, but to find the facts as
to higher wages paid by the Unit
ed States over foreign countries
and the higher cost of protection,
which findings, when formally
made by the commission, shall be
collected at customs houses aa the
rates of duty.
In this way the principle of.
protection will be permanently
settled as a national policy and
business will be relieved from
periodic upheavals by wholesale
political tariff oampatgas and re
visions.
