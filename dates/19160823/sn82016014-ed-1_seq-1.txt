Donovan, the Boston and Albany
chairman, proposed at the """B
sesion that the brotherhood chairmen
return to their homes, leaving the four
heads here to arrange a strike. His
efforts, however, were crushed.
For a time it appeared as tho the
sentiment for quick action might not
be checked. There were many
speeches. Protherhood heads, seeing
the trend of the session came to the
for, and spoke against suet .a drastic
course. Finally, through parliamen
tar, maneuvers, Donovan's plan was
killed without being made into a for

Startling Revelation in Records
of Probate Court.
ONLY ONE. CHANCE IN TWO
Matrimonial Shipwrecks Break
Up Love's Young Dream.
From November to August 213
Divorce Cases Filed.
The frightened young man asks the
outwardly excited but inwardly calm
and collected young woman the all im
portant question. She hangs her head,
carefully studies the effect and re
luctantly say "yes."
Then they go together, or the young
man goes alone, stepping high like a
horse, to Hugh MacFarland's office
and gets a marriage license. They are
married and things start off with a
flourish. No one could tell either that
there is one chance in a hundred for a
matrimonial shiwreck not in their
household.
As a matter of fact they have only
a two to one chance of continuing to
live together. Their chance of "get
ting along" together is much smaller,
for not nearly all the domestic storms
reach divorce courts.
Court House Records.
But the records in the court house
from November 2 of last year to Aug
ust 9 of this year show there was one
divorce for every two marriages. The
period of time specified is covered by
cne docket in the office of the clerk of
the district court. It has just been
closed up and the cases listed. There
were 213 divorce cases filed during
those months anf' ir. just half of the
cases the plaintiffs filed poverty affi
davits. They were unable to pay the
initial cost of a divorce proceeding.
While the divorce cases were being
filed Hugh MacFarland, probate judge,
issued 676 marriage licenses.
While 670 happy and hopeful young
couples were starting upon their mat
rimonial trip, 213 sorrowful and hope
less couples were cashing in the re
mainder of their tickets.

IS WAR'S SPHINX
Rumania's Intentions Are
Shrouded in Mystery.
Allies Use Beautiful Women
and Gold to Win Her.
Berlin. Aug. 23. Beautiful women
and huge sums of money are being
used by the Allies in the great diplo
matic battle being waged at Bucha
rest, the Allies seeking to bring Ru
mania into the war.
A distinguished German diplomat,
whose name was not revealed, made
this charge through the semi-official
German news agency today. But de
spite the Allies' efforts, Rumania is
yet undecided, he said, adding:
"Rumania's attitude is due to her
geographical situation. The country is

Now the sudden and successful Bul

cided. She probably will not give up
her adroit policy of neutrality, which
up to the present time has given her
an enormous gain in power, unless she
believes that the really decisive turn
in the war has been reached. Mean
while trade relations between Ruman
ia and the central powers continue to

Might as Well Battle Unions to
Standstill Now.
"WE CAN RUN OUR TRAINS"
Country Ought to Know If Men
Can Block Traffic.
Topekans Believe He'll Stand
Out Against Wilson.
Thru its president, E. P. Ripley,
dean of American railroad heads, the
Santa Fe has taken its stand squarely
against the demands of President Wil
son which are considered, by Topeka
railroad officials, as an invitation to
the roads to extend an unconditional
surrender to the train-service brother
hoods, and has defied the trainmen
to strike.
That statement is based on reports
and press dispatches received here to
day. President Ripley's attitude is set
forth in an interview he gave out to
the Tribune just as he was catching a
train in the Chicago station for Wash
ington. "President Wilson's so-called plan
for adjustment of the questions at
stake," said Mr. Ripley, "is no more
nor less than an invitation to the
railroads to surrender."
'What will you tell President Wil
son?" "Just what I am saying now."
"Then you do not think there is any
chance of President Wilson's flnally
adjusting matters between the men
ana tne railroads?"
You Never Can Tell.
"I don't think so, but you never
can tell. When we are stood up in a
corner and lectured and told what we
ought to do and what will happen to
the nation if we don't do it, there is no
forecasting the result.
"This is a fight in which the entire
country should stand behind the rail
roads. If a comparatively small num
ber of men can take the bit in their
teeth and demand something and tie
up commerce of the country if they
don't get it. it can be done in anv
other line of business. The men start
ed out to enforce their demands with
out arbitration. We offered to arbi
trate in any way. They would not do
it. President Wilson has lined up with
the men."
"You think his attitude unfair?"
"Yes, the present schedule calls for
the 100 miles or less a day or ten
hours or less a day. Their demands
mean a 25 per cent advance in pay."
"How do you figure that?"
"The men run, say, five hours a day.
They want eight hours' pay but they
don't give us eight hours' service. If
they run 100 miles in four hours and
then work fifteen minutes overtime
they demand pay for an extra day.
They want two days' pay for four
hours and fifteen minutes. The
schedule they demand would increase
their hourly pay without increasing
their hours of work."
Hopes for a Strike.
"Is there any plan by which peace
can be insured?"
"I know of none just now."
"But you have hopes?"
. "Yes, I hope the men will strike."
"What?"
"Exactly that. I hope they strike."
"Why?"
"If a small body of men can block
the country's business, the country
ouht to know it. The sooner the bet
ter. That condition ought to be de
feated at once and decisively."
"There is no doubt in your mind
that a strike would tie up the coun
try's business?"
"It would cripple it for a time. It
would cause a very serious incon
venience. But the strike could be
defeated. We can run our trains."
"How?"
"We can run our trains all right."
"Can the other roads run their
trains?"
"Yes."
"Then you have no fear of a strike
if it comes?"
"None. I would welcome it. It
would be broken in thirty days."
It is known in Topeka that should
a strike be called the Santa Fe has
enough applications for jobs as train
men o have fall crews on every train
ir. a few days.

President Wilson talked to the six hundred and forty chairmen representing the 400,000 railroad men in
volved in the present dispute about the eight-hour day for over fifty minutes, telling them tha he had decided to
ask that the railroads concede the eight-hoar day. The White House lown was thronged with men daily, com

Many Italian-Americans in Vic
torious Gorltz Battle,
Now Storm Heights Barricaded
by Electrical Barbwire.
With the Italian Army at Goriti,
Aug. 23. Several thousand Italian
Americans were in the army that en
tered Goritz and are now storming the
Austrian defenses south and east of
the captured fortress city. Many of
them were killed and wounded.
Fighting in Goritz are are several
Italian-Americans, including Luciano
Abbate and Pisani Gennaro, former
New York street car men, now rapid
fire gunners with an armored auto
squadron. Both were eager for news
of America.
7,500 Civilians Remain.
King Victor Emmanuel Is constant
ly at the front encouraging his troops,
regardless of all personal risk. He
was in Goritz when the city was
heavily bombarded by the Austrians
from Mont Marco and surrounding
heights.
Goritz is under martial law, but
7,600 remaining civilians are grad
ually resuming their normal life. The
Italians are throwing up strong forti
fications to make certain that the'
Austrians do hot recapture the city
before they can push on with a vigor
ous offensive. Both south and east of
Goritz, General Cadorna's lines are be
ing gradually advanced tho at some
places under the greatest difficulties.
Austrian positions on the heights sur
rounding Goritz are defended by row
after row of electrically charged
barbed wire.
TEST 2. FARE
I. C. C. Holds Illinois Law Is a
i Discrimination.
Railroads Compelled to Carry
Matter Into Court.
Chicago, Aug. 23. Representatives
of all railroads operating in Illinois
are attending a conference here to
day to discuss advancing passenger
fares between all points in the state to
2.4 cents a mile.
The law in Illinois fixes a maximum
of 2 cents per mile but the interstate
commerce commission recently ruled
that it is a discrimination to charge
higher rates for interstate travel of
equal distance than for state trips.
Ihe discrimination is to be abo.ished
by advancing state rates. It was de
clared the advance in passenger fares
will be in violation of the state stat
ute and will therefore involve the
question of state rights. The Illinois
case will be used as a test suit, t was
said.
ARMY BILL IS PASSED
Senate Todya Approved Appropriation
of S267.596.530 for Land Force.
Washington. Aug. 23. The $267,
596.530.10 army appropriation bill
which pays for Uncle Sayi's increased
land force, passed the senate today.
The bill included the senate's orig
inal revision of the, article of war
which had not been changed for 100
years, in place of Representative
Hay's revision which exempted retired
officers from eourtmartial and which
made rPesident Wilson veto the meas

MOTHERMOURNS
Mrs. Kiske Doesn't Want to
Leave Her Children.
She Mnst Go to the Topeka
State Hospital.
HAS BEEN TRIED ONCE BEFORE
Becomes Mother of a Second
Child Since Then.
Her Hnsband Swears to the
Latest Complaint.
Elma Kiske, married, 28 years old,
mother of two little children, said
nothing when officers went to her
house today with an-insanity com-iHaint-
She said nothing except in re
jy lo 'questions1 when she was tried,
butafter she was declared insane and
left alone for a moment she slipped
out of the sheriff's office, hurried
down the steps and ran.
Lt. L. Kiene, sheriff, ran after her.
He caught her without difficulty. She
offered no resistance.
"I ought to go home to my babies,"
she murmured. "I ought to."
But she did not go home ' to her
babies. They may be grown before
ehe goes home to them. She may
never go back to the home she left
this morning. She was placed in the
county jail until arrangements can be
made to take her to a state hospital.
"I don't like jobs of that kind," said
Hugh Larimer, under sheriff, after he
had taken her to the court house. "It
nearly broke that poor woman's heart
to leave her children. She didn't com
plain nor make any resistance. But I
never saw greater mother-love than
she displayed before we brought her
away."
Mrs. Kiske is the wife of Samuel
Kiske and they live at Twenty-fourth
and Pennsylvania. They are the par
ents of two young children, the
youngest not more than six months of
age. For eighteen months insanity has
been creeping upon the mother. Over
a year ago complaints were made of
her and she was tried in the , probate
court. She demanded a Jury trial and
the jury found her sane. Her hus
band was opposed to proceedings at
that time and employed an attorney
to represent her.
Husband Swore to Complaint.
But the complaint upon which she
was tried today was sworn to by the
husband who testified that he could
stand conditions around his home no
longer. The wife has turned against
him. Her mania is a most peculiar
one. It relates to their marriage.
She doubts that they are legally
married and on more than one occa
sion has brought her mariage certifi
cate to the probate judge's office and
demanded to know if it were legal.
Right now her peculiar mania re
lates to her husband. She declares
that besides being married to her he
is married to a negro woman and that
he is the father of twin negro babies.
She appears to be norma on other
matters but she has no use for her
husband since she deeloped the pres
ent mainia.. Before that she was con
stantly worrying because of fear that
she was not properly married to him.
Mrs. Kiske is a neat motherly look
ing young woman. She kept he- head
bowed and allowed the commission to
conduct the case. But after she was
moed in the sheriff's office tears
trickled thru the fingers coering her
eyes.

FIGHTING ON 150-MI. FRONT
Turks Send Troops to Rein

Kumania Will Wait Until Al
lies Get Underway.
London, Aug. 23. A great battle of
nations with the troops of nearly ev
ery European belligerent involved, is
gradually developing in the Balkans
as the fighting along the 150 mile
front increases in fury.
Turkey is sending reinforcements
into Bulgaria, according to an Athens
dispatch today. At least one division
of Turkish soldiers is en route to join
the Bulgars in the attack on 'tie al
lied lines, while another division will
be so placed as to threaten Rumania
should that country decide to enter the
war on the side of the allies.
Austria will be asked to send a few
detachments to the Greek border to
join the Bulgars, Germans and lurks
in resisting the combined attacks of
French
English. Russians, Italians,
under the first Bulgarian attack tne
' allies have reinforced their lin.?s and
are strongly on the offensive n the
Vardar Vtlley, northwest of Saloniki.
On the wings, the Bulgarians have
made further slight advances by rea
son of their numerical superiority, but
Anglo-French artillery and the stub
,.im rouiuiHni'f- of the Serbs have con
siderably checked the momentum of
the advancing enemy torces.
All press dispatches from Rumania
bear evidence of close cenM rship but
fmm indirect sources it is reported
that the fighting in the Balkans has
caused a profound impression in
Bucharest.
But despite warlike reports brought
to Liondcn in a roundabout way. many
persons well informed on the Balkan
situation, do not believe that Rumania
will enter the war at least until the
allies have advanced up tne varoar
Vallev and have scored decisive gains
against the Bulgarians. It has been
known here for several weeks that
the third Rumanian army was mobil
ised and in readiness for instant ser
vice, but there has been no other pos
itive evidence of military movements
to warrant the belie? that Rumania is
about to declare war.
Interest Veers to Balkans.
London, Aug. 23. Developments in
the Balkans take first place in both
news and editorial columns of the
newspapers this morning. The papers
display keen interest not or.ly in the
landing ol tne Italian ana xiussian
troops at Saloniki but also in possible
. the greatest energy in Bukowina close
i to the Rumanian irontier ana aireaay
have gained "a very brilliant success.
The Daily News in an editorial sums
up the Balkan situation as follows:
Would Isolate Turkey.
"The imminent general offensive
against Bulgaria is of great import
ance. One of the first results of a
successful offensive by the entente
; allies would be a complete rupture of
Germany's communications with the
east and the isolation and capitulation
of Turkey. This is a plain geographical
fact.
"There are also other issues upon
which It is wiser to reflect than to en
large. These affect the fortunes of
the two neutrals, Greece and Rumania,
as well as the dozen belligerents.
