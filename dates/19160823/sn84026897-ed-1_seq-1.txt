MT. ZION NEWS.
New Church Nearing Comple
tion. Corner Stone to be Laid
Saturday. Revival Begins
Sunday.
With W. A. Par?ue at the hoad,
and the neighbors and members,
helping during the weeks as they
could, the new Mt. Zion church is
now nearing completion. Wednes
day of this week has been appoint
ed as clean-up day, when the build
ing and grounds will be alive with
the obi and young of this commu
nity, getting everything in readi
ness for the public services to be
held there on next Sunday-our
regular 4-th Sunday meeting.
But this will not by any means
be an ordinary meeting, because,
for one thing, it will be the opening
day of our annual protracted meet
ing, which will continue through
the following week, with Rev. T.
H. Posey in the pulpit. Then our
friends of the Masonic erder wish
to join hands with us in the com
mendable work which is being done.
So Saturday at 5 o'clock they will
conduct the ceremony of laying a
corner stone foi the church. This
no doubt will be an interesting pro
ceeding, and it is fixpected that a
very large crowd wiil be present to
witness it.
Dinner will be served on the
grounds that day, and the following
days of the week.
The young people of our com
munity have been meeting every
Wednesdaj" night for several weeks
to improve themselves in singing.
So far, these meetings have been
held at the home of Mrs. W. A.
Pardue.
Our Sunday school has kept up
splendidly throughout the summer.
On the 1st and 2nd Sundays of this
month, it had the pleasure of lis
tening to preaching by Rev. Jos.
A. Gaines. Last Sunday there was
a good crowd present.
At the olose.of theSunday schoolv
there was a call meeting of the W.
M. S. of Mt. Zion church. This
was for the purpose of electing.del
egates to the annual meeting at
Gilgal. Miss Marie Padgett and
Mrs. J. W. Pritchard were chosen
to go; but fearing that they could
not go, it was decided to consider
any delegates who could go. Our
last regular meeting was held at the
home of Mrs. E. M. Padgett, Mrs.
J. W. Pritchard presiding. Light
refr. shments were served at its
close. The next meeting will be
at the home of Mrs. Eddie Walker,
in Trenton.
This community was shocked by
the death of Mr. Hite Burton, which
occurred in Vaucluse on last Satur
day, the interment taking place at
the family burying ground near
here on yesterday (Sunday). Mr.
Burton spent his life in this neigh
borhood, moving to Vaucluse only
last winter. We are sorry to learn
that four of his children are down
sick with the same dread disease
which he had, typhoid fever.
On thc luth inst., little W. A.
Pardue celebrated his birth-day by
giving a party to his little friends.
The children from this neighbor
hood, with some from Granireville
and other places were there. Happy
games were enjoyed throughout the
afternoon, while the crowning pleas
ure was the bountiful repast served
at its .close.
Rev. Jos. A. Gaines closed a very
successful meeting at Ebenezer
church, in Trenton, on last Sunday
night. Kine were added to the
church, one by letter and eight by
baptism, the rite of which was ad
ministered that night. On the next
morning, Mr. Gaines with his fami
ly, left for their home in West
Maden, Ind.

RED OAK GROVE.
Looking to W. M. U. and Asso

Have Gone. Y. M. A's.
Active.
We Ret? Oak Grove people do
not fully resolve to give up that our
summer vacation is quite spent, un
til after the annual W- M. U. and
our Edgefield association, which
quickly follows, have passed, but
with ihe going away of quite a
number of our visitors and this
balmy-pleasant morning makes us
feel th? dawning of harvest time.
We can resolve to go on doing our
part in this world's work with a
happier heart, a firmer belief in our
selves and our neighbors, and with
the conviction that during these
vacation days of ours, there comes
a most "beautiful opportunity to put
forth the best in us, for the ming
ling together with representatives
in our homes from different places.
We can in the quiet talk of our
schools,; our domestic work, our fu
fure plans in general, with those
whose activities are not limited to
the town in .vhiuhtbej' live, 01 even
more narrowly circumscribed to the
home. There is always someone
a little nv>re experienced with cer
tain phases of life, with a little
more education and training in some
branches who can and will help us
out of our difficulties and bring us
one step-nearer the point we wanted
to reach. We can and will make
such saorifices as may be necessary
to make our homes attractive, and
above ali try to let our influence be
for good. "Remember to live not
for thyself alone-"

their discussion when they meet of
what they want to do. By that we
know, some at least, have the work
at heart
The Sunbeams at Red Oak Grove
expected to have had a representa
tive at the Elgefield meeting, but
bad weather prevented.
Campaign Meeting at Trenton.
Saturday last was very pleasantly
spent at Trenton by all of the coun
ty candidates and several hundreds
of voters, the occasion being the
duly appointed campaign meeting.
A platform and seats were arranged
in the beautiful grove opposite the
depot. The people gave a respect
ful hearing to all of the candidates
who spoke. The first presented
were Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Wells
for the senate. These wore followed
by Mr. Evans, Mr. Walker and Mr.
Williams for the house of repre
sentatives. At the conclusion of
Mr. Williams' speech dinner was
announced. And it was a royal
feast, too. This was the first free
dinner of the campaign. It was
furnished by the good people of
Trenton and vicinity. In addition
to the regular picnic menu, barbe
cue hash was nerved in great abun
dance. Iced tea flowed freely and
refreshed hundreds of visitors. The
people of Trenton proved them
selves to be most charming hosts
and ?hostesses and their beautiful
hospitality was sincerely apprecia
ted by all the visitors present. We
have heard a great number of ex
pressions commending the Trenton
people for their lavish hospitality
on this occasion.
After dinner the candidates for
supervisor presented their claims,
all of the speakers of the day be
ing presented by Mr. Wallace
Wise, who made a splendid chair
man.
At the close of the meeting every
body gathered about the base ball
grounds and witnessed a good game
between Graniteville and Trenton,
the score being in favor of the
Trenton nine.
A Pleasant Night Spent at Ro
pers.
On the way to Hardys for the
Sunday meeting, Saturday night
was spent in the delis htful and
hospitable country home of Mr. D.
E. Lanham where the four daught
ers, Misses Emmie, Lila, Minnie
and Grace are the life and joy. Miss
Emmie has been teaching for sev
eral years and is the efficient super
intendent of the Young Woman's
Auxiliary of Edgetieid association.
She is making an effort now to build
a new school house at Ropers
A'\9i Lila has taught for severa,
years, for the past year and the
coming year in the eastern section
of our state, and Miss Minnie is one
of the most promising students of
Coker College, entering this com
ing session, her junior year. Miss
Grace is still tuo young to go away
to school, but is preparing: for the
time.
Music and happiness and useful
service are all a part of this happy
home. Mr. Lanham is one of the
most honored citizens of our coun
ty aud deserves that all these
members of his household and his
sons in the homes adjoining should,
as they are doing, make the hori
zon bright in his tater years.
The home is an ideal one, com
fortable and convenient and with a
splendid view of theencircling hills,
and a car to transport the young
people when they desire to make au
exit from the home roof tree.
Ropers has a store under the di
rection of Mr. Robert Timmerman,
and the school is also located here.
The Presbyterians at one time had
a church here, and the building
still stands, furnished, but the con
gregation has scattered and remov
ed to other places, so that no eer
vices are held there at the present
time. This church was built du
ring the successful pastorate of Dr.
Morris while he was a resident of
Edgetieid. Mr. Lanham lives about
a mile and a half from Ropers
Cross Roads.
' . Splendid Day 'at Hardy's.
The annual revival meeting be
gan at Hardys church on Sunday
morning last when Rev. P. B. Lan
ham filled the pulpit and preached
from the text, "Deny yourself,
take up your cross and follow me."
The exposition of this scripture was
comforting, and encouraging to
Christians to re-consecrate them
selvas to the higher Christian life.
Mr. Lanham mentioned that 16
young men and women had
been baptized as a result of the
excellent meeting in which Rev. T.
H. Posey assisted.
At the conclusion of the sermon
the announcements for the afternoon
were made, and the recess for din
ner took place. This was very de
lightfully spent in conversation with
the friends whom we had not seen
in a long time, and in making new
and interesting acquaintances. The
afternoon session was given over to
the Womans Mission Society, Mr.
Lanham annouueingthe programme.
Mrs. J. L. Mims was called upon
and gave some facts as to the Wo
mans Work in the Edgefield asso
ciation from 1873 to the present
time, and in stressing the impor
tance of reaching the standard of
Excellence. Miss Beatrice Stevens
sang a solo, "Make me a channel
of Blessing," appropriately selected
for the subject of the afternoon.
"Missions in Europe" was the
theme of avery helpful talk by Mrs.
Mamie N. Tillman.
Following this, Miss Georgia
Reese, secretary of the society made
the 2nd annual report which was
exceedly encouraging.
Mr. J. L. Mims was called upon
to talk, and responded with some
encouraging facts concerning the
importance of the country church.
There were representatives at
Hardys from many sections of our
county, from North Augusta, and
the city of Augusta, including many
young people. So pleasant was the
occasion and so loath were we all
to leave, that the longdistance was
forgotten and we did not leave the
church till five o'clock to make the
journey home.

HARDTS HAPPENINGS.
Large Congregation at Hardy's.
Sermon by Pastor in Morn
ing. Missionary Meeting
in Afternoon.
Sunday was a lovely dav and
there was a fine congregation at
Hardy's for the opening clay of the
protracted meeting. I do not know
when I have been so surprised or
delighted as when we walked np to
the front, there sat Mrs. J. L.
Minis, Mrs. Mamie Tillman, Misses
Florence Mims and Sallie Ham
mond. We speak of Miss Sallie be
cause she is one of our dear
friends. We were so glad to see ber,
but of course she was not with Mrs.
Mims' party. After dismissal we
also found Mr. Mims was there.
We are always glad to see these
splendid people among us and hear
their inspiring addresses. Each of
the three Mr. and Mrs. Minis and
Mrs. Tillman gave us a talk on
mission work, which we enjoyed so
much and hope they did not finP
the journey too long to risk coming
again soon and by all means we
hope to have them all with us next
August for the W. M. U. which
will meet with the Hardy's mission
ary society. We want them to re
member their promise to us, they
are to spend one night with us.
While we would be delighted to
have them longer we will not be
selfish, for there are others who
want them also.
Rev. P. B. Lanham spent Sunday
night with Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Bunch, expecting to have to go for
Rev. Sexton but Mrs. Georgia Mc
Kie very kindly went down in her
car and met bim and brought bim
up to the church. Rev. Howard
came up to assist with the meeting.
They b Jth spent Monday night at

We hope to have a grand revival
and outpouring of the spirit and
many souls saved during this meet- . ^
?cg. Were yl?d-toTH??r tho splendid, ..
report from the Gilgal meeting.
Wish it were possible for us to be
with the ladies at Gilgal next Tues
day and Wednesday for the W. M.
U.
Mr. George Medlock was brought
home from the hospital Sunday
night by Mrs. Georgia McKie and
stood the trip very well though is
quite weak.
Mrs. Sallie Bunch is quite feeble
we are sorry to say and does not
improve very much.
Sorry to hear Dr. Taylor Briggs
does not improve fast. Hope he may
soon cure himself. Was glad to see
Mr. Will Briggs was able to be out
at Sunday services.
Miss Lena Lanham spent Sunday
night with Miss Marjorie McKie
and returned home with Mr. Willie
Lanham Monday.
Hope the good people at Ropers
will have a full house at their play
in September and realize a hand
some sum for the school house
fund. They ought to have it during
full moon. I think more would at
tend.

Kind Words From the "City of
Success."
Speaking of the booster edition
of The Edgefield Chronicle, reminds
us that Edgefield is one town that
ought to be, and we feel sure is,
very proud of its newspaper. In
The Chronicle, edited by Col. L.
Wigfall Cheatham, and The Ad
vertiser, edited by Mr. J. L. Miras,
first vice-president of the State Press
association, the town has two as
good county newspapers as any
county in the state can boast of;
they are edited by men of the very
highest type and their mission in
life is to uplift and not to tear
down. They live together in broth
ly love and unity.-Spartauburg
