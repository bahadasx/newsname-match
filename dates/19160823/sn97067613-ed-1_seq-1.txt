The County Fair
The season of Agricultural Fairs is up
on us again and attention is directed
anew to the helpful exhibit of the La
moille Valley Fair, which for many years
has given the farmers of the county an
annual opportunity to meet and exchange
views and discover what their neighbors
are accomplishing in the way of better
ments and improvments in the tilling o
the soil and stock raising. The displays
at the Fair are always educative and the
premiums which are awarded stimulate
a healthy rivalry in the neighborhood,
for a person who can win a prize in any
line of endeavor has promoted a compe
tition in his own community that must
make for greater excellence and hence
must produce substantial results.
Hpsirlia nil fhia tliia ia tti annual nn. !
,
portunity for friends and neighbors to
meet and have the real old-fashioned visit
which come only at Fair time. On this
occasion many meet only once a year and
the visit and the let-up from the daily
routine of the busy life is an incentive to
good health and happiness. . Therefore,
plan to attend the Fair, and take the
whole family with you and have a real
good time. v
Next Wednesday Morning
- In order to give all hands an oppor
tunity to attend the Fair next week this
paper will be printed early next Wed

advertisers will please send in their copy
one day earlier and "don't you forget it!"

departraeut hurried to the scene of the
fire, but the flames were so far advanced
when discovered that the efforts were in
vain. There was no hay in the barn, but
a surry belonging to ban Wbittemore
was destroyed. There was an insurance
of $125 on the barn. The origin of the
fire is unknown.

Oldest Dancing Master
Geo. Elmore, who was in town Mon
day, is probably the oldest active dancing
master in Vermont, if not in the 0. S.
He has been instructing in the terpscbi-
corean art for forty-two years and is
still at it, although he calls this his last
year. He is in his 73d year but doesn't
look a bit over 60, and he says be likes
to dance now just as much as he ever
did. He left last night for Chicago to
attend the annual convention of the
Dancing Masters' Association, of which
he has been a member 32 years and miss
ed but one or two meetings in that time.
Although he went away from Morris
ville 25 years ago, George still retains an
interest in the place, even if many of the
old faces are gone. He is thinking seri
ously of again taking tip his residence
here when he retires from active busi
ness. You'll receive a hearty welcome,
George.
HYDE PARK

versity of Vermont, State Agricultural
College is in town to commence his duties
as instructor in the Lamoille Central
Academy. Mr. Wood will have charge
of the Agricultural work which the school
will take up this year.
Petitions for candidates for Represent
ative must be filed with the Town Clerk
on or before Monday next. We hear but
little regarding candidates. The names
of E. A. Wedge, R. C Crocker and H. M.
McFarland have been "mentioned" on
the Republican side and for the Demo
crats we hear John H. Gray and Oscar
N. Campbell frequently suggested. We
presume there aill be oiiers and as the
election does not come nntil November
there'll be plenty of time to write in your
favorite, if he does not get his name on
the primary ballot.
In quite a number of cases petitions
have been sent to the County Clerk that
have the endorsement of the same party
for the same office on two petitions. Of
course this throws out the petitions en
tire. No person can sign more than one
petition for the same office. Innotafcw
cases the party belore whom the cettifi
cate was sworn neglected to put on his
official signature. Wherever the clerk
knew the position held by the official be
has added that thereto.
