Political developments in the
Balkans overshadowed In interest
for the moment even the important
military operations In progress
there. In connection with the at
titude of Roumania, the course of
the Russian campaign in Bukowina,
close to the Roumanian frontier, Is
being closely watched. The latest
advices from Teutonic sources,
however, are that the Russians are
being held up by the Teutonic re
sistance, along: the entire front to
the north in .Gallcla and Volhynia.
With Russian and Italian troops
added to the French, British and
Serbian forces in the field, the al
lies have a formidable array of
fighting men on the Macedonian
front. However, the Bulgars have
pushed both wings and it is only
in the center, In the Vardar valley,
that the allies have scored.
On the western front, on the
Somme the British continue closing
In on Thiepval, on their left flank,
and apparently have Guillemont, on
their right, almost within their

Favorable Crop Reports.
The Tageblatt says that favorable
crop forecasts are being borne out fully
and that excellent yields of all cereals
iare being obtained thruout Germany
Fodder also Is plentiful. The potato
crop, however, probably is inferior to
that of last year, owing to the exces
sive rains. Sugar production has ln
creased.
The admiralty Issued today a state
ment asserting that the losses of the
British and French navies in line of
battleships and cruisers to Aug. 1 com

the Cologne Gazette, on the Russian'
front, says that in the fighting in East
Galicia, from Aug. 14 to 17, the Rus
sians lost 5,000 killed, while the total
Gorman casualties was eighty.
"If the enemy continues to squander
enormous quantities of ammunition -in
addition to suffering heavy losses, his
final exhaustion is inevitable," the cor
respondent says.

Self Destruction.
London, Aug. 23.—"One hundred and
eighteen persons, women mostly, cotn
mitted suicide In Germany in a month
because of misery and starvation."

the Daily Express. He says his infor
mation comes from Munich, and adds:
"A mother, accompanied by her three
young children, shot herself before the
gates of the royal palace in Munich in
the presence of the sentries. A placard
was found pinned to her breast:
"'Your majesty, feed my children I
can not.'
"Parents are abandoning their chil
dren in the parks In Increasing num
bers. The police have collected nearly

NO PEACE OVERTURES.
Lord Robert Cecil Denies That Britain
Has Been Approached on Subject.
London, Aug. 23.—'No peace overtures'
have been made to Great Britain, de
clared Lord Robert Cecil, minister ot
war trade and parliamentary under
secretary of foreign affairs in the house
of commons today.
Lord Robert's statement was made in
response to a question In regard to
"peace rumors'' and the situation in the
Balkans.
"No overtures have 'been made for
peace," said Lord Robert. "There is
only one way In which they can be
made and that is from an enemy to the
government of this country. If any
such overtures were made the first
thing we would do would be to con
sult with our allies."
As to the Balkans Lord Robert said
the most important factor consisted of
operations from Saloniki. The allies'
relations with the. new Greek govern
ment, he said, were thoroughly satis
factory.

WANT ASSURANCES
OF GOOD REVENUES
Might Concede Eight-Hour Day Tem
porarily if Promised Increased Rev
enues From Other Sources—Brother^
hood Men Growing Impatient and
Minority Attempts to Declare Nego
tiations at End.
Washington, Aug. 23.—The rail
road employes' committee showed
such marked signs of unrest today
at the delay in negotiations be
tween President Wilson and the
railroad executives that the lead
ers of the men expressed fears of
holding them much longer.
The employes' meeting this
morning was thrown into an up
roar by speeches of a minority
which demanded immediate action
unless the roads accept the presi
dent's plan, but the leaders suc
ceeded in adjourning it before a
vote could be'taken.
They said afterwards that while
the pressure for immediate action
came from a minority it was
strong, but they believed the ma
jority would be willing to give the
president a little more time. Some
urged that they go home, leaving
the brotherhood heads with au
thority to call a strike if the rail
roads do- not accept the presi
dent's plan. The meeting ad
journed to 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
"It is our belief," one of the
committeemen said, "that the
roads are playing for time with
the president just as they have
done with us. They are tiring us
out all right and the men are
getting disgusted."
While the road executives con
tinued deliberations on what form
of counter proposal they shall
make to President Wilson, the
president conferred with Senator
Newlands and Representative
Adamson about the bill to increase
the membership of the commerce
commission by two.
Possibility of passing... an eight
hour law
for
railroads was dis­
cussed among several congres
sional leaders but no definite pro
gram was evolved.
Washington. Aug. 23—Three rail
road presidents today reported to the
committee which is trying to formu
late an answer on behalf of the roads
to President Wilson's suggested plan
for meeting the demands of the union
brotherhoods the substance of their
conference at the White House last
night. It is understood that the con
ference was for the purpose of learn
ing how the roads could reimburse
their treasuries if they acceded to the
president's plan.
The attitude of the president on the
subject was not disclosed but the re
port was considered significant as
showing in what direction the rail
road heads are turning in their efforts
to reach a conclusion.
The big committee of brotherhooa
representatives was impatient at the
delay, but W. G. Lee, head of the
trainmen's brotherhood, expressed t'n«-.
belief that they would not be held nert
past tomorrow.
A statement issued by the employes'
committee charged the roads with in
consistency in contending for arbitrat
ing, tlio refusing to arbitrate demands
of employes on a number of minor
roads not represented directly in the
present negotiations but said to be
controllec^by the larger lines.
Would Bankrupt Small Linee.
Lewis, W. Hill, president of the
Great Northern railway, and one of
the strongest opponents of the eight
hour day, declared in a statement to
day that many western roads in par
ticular would have scant earnings next
year and that many, would be forced
into receivership by an eight-hour day.
The men, tired of the delay, pave
free expression to their opinion at to
day's meeting. The men felt that tho
railroads show a disposition to disre
gard their sacrifice of the demand of
time and a half for overtime. The
brotherhood leaders decided not to is
sue a statement, expected this morn
ing, until later in the day.
President Wilson summoned Sena
tor Newlands and Representative
Adamson, chairmen of the senate and
house commerce committees, to the
White House this morning. It is un-,
derstood he planned to discuss with
them legislation on the railroad strike
situation. The president's plan would
create a commission to investigate the
workings of the eight-hour day and
collateral issues.
Permanent Commission Dieeuseed.
After their conference with Presi
dent Wilson, Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson said they had
discussed the strike generally but that
no legislation to meet the situation
had been gone over specifically. The
bill to add two members to the Inter
state commerce committee was one of
the things discussed. They also dls
c-jsed the creation of a permanent
commission to Investigate such con
troversies.
It was said today that the railroad
executives had decided to act as a
unit In handling the present situation.
The program of the railroad execu
tives was said today to deal first with
the principle of arbitration and after
ward with the eight hour day.
In administration circles it was de
clared that both the president and the
rallrpad executives seemed to be on
the way to an agreement.
••iXAll
How Situation Stands.
On, the basis of information from an
authoritative source the situation may
be outlined as follows:
The railroad officials are working
out proposals which they will submit
to the president embodying a proposed
modification of his terms of settlement.
The executives so far have received
no encouragement to believe that the
president will consider any changes In
his proposed compromise save possibly
in regard to the commission to inves-«
tigate the overtime pay.
The railroad chiefs would like to
have this commission made a perma
nent body to arbitrate all disputes be
tween the carriers and their employes.
If the president flatly refuses to re
cede from the demands he has made
on behalf of the unions the carriers
probably will submit to the terms, pro
vided they receive adequate guarantees
of a subsequent Increase of freight
rates sufficient to offset the wage ad
vances, estimated by the railroads at
$50,000,000 a year.
Modification Only Hope,
Some of the executives frankly admit
that their only hope now Is to induce
the president to make some modifica
tion In his plan which will embody to
some extent the principles for which
the railroads are contending. They
practically concede that If the presi
dent stands his ground they will be
compelled to agree to the eight-hour
day.
They will put forth a prodigious ef
fort, however, to procure some sort of
recognition of their contention that ail
disputes henceforth should be settled
by arbitration. They would prefer to
have the Interstate commerce commis
sion enlarged and directed to act as
arbiter of wage and other disputes be
tween theT carriers and their employes.
In any event the carriers argue that
the commission proposed by the presi
dent to investigate the effects of the
eight-hour day and to determine over
time pay should be made a permanent
body, and somo plan worked out in
connection therewith to insure arbitra
tion of all controversies.
Think He Must Yield Point.
President Wilson has committed
himself to the belief in arbitration, tho
he was careful not to say whether vol
untary or compulsory arbitration. The
railroad chiefs do not see how he pos
sibly can refu!» to incorporate in his
commission Investigation plan a pro
vision which will commit the unions
to arbitration on such disputes as the
pending controversy.
The railroad chiefs believe that If thv
president would consent to this modi
fication and put the matter up to the
employes, the union leaders would be
placed on the defensive before the pub
lic and eventually would be compelled
to yield on the principle of arbitration
of future disputes.
The majority of the executives be
lieve that in the last week the public
has come to realize the justice of their
contentions, but they had regretfully
reached the conclusion that- the presi
dent Is not disposed^to recede from his
position so far as the etght-1iour daj
is concerned.
Sta^fd J$y.£ftimates.
President' Wilsritoptens to see Senator
Newlands and Representative Adamson
again, probablj"late today, and expects
to get .another^ call from the railroad
executives some time before tomorrow.
There were many indications that the
railroad presidents were considering the
eight-hour day on condition that some
definite assurance be given that future
disputes be arbitrated.
President Holden, of the Burlington,
chairman of the committee of eight,
made this statement.
"A meeting of the president and man
agers was held at 11 this morning and
a recess was taken until 6 o'clock. In
the meantime the special committee of
presidents is in session giving further
consideration to the various problems
presented by the situation."
Elisha Lee, chairman of the man
agers' committee, said:
"There seems to be some question as
to the accuracy of the estimates made
by the railways of what it would cost
to grant the demands of the train em,
ployes, and 1 make this statement ti
qualify the public mind on this phase
of the matter.
"There has been no change In our
original estimate that to grant the de
mand would add (100,000,000 a year to
operation expenses. On this the com
mittee investigation has confirmed the
substantial accuracy of that estimate."
PLAGUE MAKES SLIGHT GAINS.
Record Heat Wave in New York Does
Not Increase Cases Materially.
New York, Aug. 23.—New York's rec
ord breaking heat wave has failed to
spread the epidemic of infantile paral
ysis. Only a slight gain was shown to
day in the number of deaths and new
cases reported. During the twenty-four
hour period ending at 10 a. m. the
plague killed forty-two children and 142
were stricken. This compares with
thirty-nine deaths and 118 new cases
yesterday.
Contrary to public opinion. Health
Commissioner Emerson said today he
had no reason to believe that hot
wea,ther spreads infantile paralysis.
This opinion is formed as result of a
study of the daily temperatures and
the number of new cases developing
day to day. Nevertheless, he said, the
hot days would hasten the deaths of
the ill children.
"One of the worst epidemics that
ever occurred took place in Norway In
mid-winter," said Mr. Emerson.

AWAITING RESULT
OF RUSSIAN DRIVE
German Statement Disputed by Lon
don Press and Claim le Made That
Roumania Is Already Aligned With
Entente Allies—German Newepapera
Declared to Have Conceded It.
Berlin, via Sayvllle, Aug. 23.—Rou
mania has not decided whether she
will enter the war, in the opinion of a
person characterized by the Overseas
Xews Agency as a "distinguished dip
lomatist who is especially conversant
with Roumania affairs." On being
asked by the news agency as to the
present situation, he i«id:
1 "Roumanla's attitude is due to her
geographical situation. The country Is
virtually surrounded by belligerents.
Her statesmen aro guided by the desirt
to spare the country the injury- whicU
would be unavoidable.
"Since the beginning of the present
conflagration the entente powers, par
ticularly Russia, have been uctlve in
Roumania. The country U' flooded with
Russian agents and spies of all de
scriptions. The entente uses money
lavishly to bribe politicians and to in
fluence the press. Now the sudden and
successful Bulgarian advance has
brought a change in the situation, and
apparently the Russian, offensive Is
slackening. At present Roumania Is
undecided. She piobably will not give
up her adroit policy of neutrality.
Meanwhile, trad? relations between
Roumania and the central powers con
tinue to be normal and active."
German Statement Disputed.
London, Aug.
23.—Developments
The Russians are pushing ahead in
Bukowina close to the Roumanian
frontier, and already have gained a
"very brilliant success." The Dally
News siums up the situation as fol
lows:*
"The imminent general offensive
against Bulgaria Is of great Impor
tance. One of the first results of a suc
cessful offensive by General Sarail
would be a complete rupture of Ger
many's communication with the east
and the isolation and capitulation of
Turkey. This is the plain geogra
phical fact.
"There are also other issues upon
which it is wiser to reflect than to en
large. These affect the fortunes of the
two neutrals as well as a dozen bel
ligerents.
"The situation In Greece, with tho
Greeks already engaged with the Bul
gars, If rich in possibilities. As to tho
Intentions of Roumania, the German
press is authority for tho statement
that Roumania has Joined hands with
the entente. It Is difficult to conceive
what motives the Germans could have
In circulating such a statement other
than the belief that it Is true."
PERSHING'S TROOPS FIT.
First Review of Punitive Expedition
Show* Men Hard as Nails.
Field Headquarters of the American
Punitive Expedition in Mexico, Aug. 21,
by aeroplane to Columbus, N. M.. Aug.
^2.—The 5,000 Infantrymen, cavalrymen
and artillery men, hardened by months
of active service, and re-equlpped after
their hardsthips, marched past Brig.
Gen. John J. Pershing, commander or.
the expeditionary forces here, in the
first grand review held since the troops
crossed the frontier March 15.
Bronzed by the sun, the men showed
in their very carriage their discipline
and the! refflciency. Veteran officer ',
inured by years of service to such
spectacles, made no effort to restrain
words of praise. The general himse'.f
was deeply stirred.
Down the front of the serried col
umns, General Pershing, pausing oc
casionally to permit a more extensive
examination of equipment, trotted
briskly with his staff. Circling the
reglmentn he returned to the reviewing
post just as the Twenty-fourth infan
try began to move.
Headed fey their band, the negro in
fantrymen marched with matchless
precision past the little group of staff
officers, the officers' hand snapping to
a salute when they reached the gen
eral's red flag with Its single white
star.
Following cams a regiment of caval
ry, horses mincing past, well fed and
glossy. Even the mules of the pack
trains danced by. With the appear
ance of the mounted troops, the band's
"brassy blare" was succeeded by the
shrill notes of the bugle corps. Troop
after troop of cavalry filed past, each
troop riding with the easy grace ac
corded popularly only to cowboys,
their alignment perfect.
The big mules, carrying the moun
tain batteries and hitched to the
wagons, strained at their traces, ap
parently as willing and In as good con
dition as at the outset of the expedi
tion. Even to the trained eye of offi
cers there was no discernible flaw In
the condition of the men, stock, equip
ment or ordnance. The troops looked
as. Indeed they were, "ready for any
duty," to quote General Pershing.

New York, Aug. 23.—Jerome Allen,
of Muquoketa, Iowa, a member of the
Hovey Arctic expedition, which met
with misfortune on the way to the re
lief of the MacMillan exploration party,
has arrived here from Copenhagen,
with details of the expedition's failure.
The MacMillan party was In search of
Peary's "Crocker Land," reported by
subsequent explorers to have been a
mirage Instead of land.
Dr. E. O. Hovey and his" party left
New York In July, 1915( on the power
schooner George E. Cluett, equipped by
the American Museum of Natural His
tory. They were caught in the ice early
last winter near Cape York, off the
northerly coast of Greenland, thru an
accident to the vessel's machinery.
Mr. Allen, Dr. Hovey and others In
the party then started on a 1.300 mile
dog sledge Journey across Greenland to
get aid, but Dr. Hovey caught a se
vere cold after traveling about sixty
miles and had to return to the ship.
After two months hard traveling Mr.
Allen said, the sled party reached Eged
S'lilmlc. il Danish settlement. Here they
took a steamship for Denmark. Sub
sequently the steamer Denmark was
dispatched to relieve those remaining
on the Clulett, all of whom were well,
Mr. Allen said, when he left.
Officials of the American Museum of
Natural History said today they had
as yet no word from Ensign Green.
Jerome Lee Allen, of Iowa, tho wire

happen this year.
"The people are thinking republican
doctrines nnd they are for the repub

fully strong current of sentiment for
the republican party In Indiana this
year. All we have to do Is to crystal
lize that sentiment on our candidates
and we will pile tip a bl^ majority."
