GAVE PAJAMA PARTY
Vermont Soldiers at the
Border
Amuse Themselves.
Eagle Pass., Texas, Aug. 19. The
First Battalion of the First Vermont
Infantry. compc3ed of Companies A,
B, C and I), from Rutland. St. Albans,
University of Vermont and St. Johns
bury, respectively, has been relieved
from outpost duty along a border
frontage of eighty-one milos by a bat
talion from the Second Kansas Regi
ment. The lionie-cooiers could hardly
get their bearings at first because of
the changed appearance of the camp
since the new mess halls have been
constructed.
They all say they enjoyed the out
post duty, but are nevertheless glad
to be back with the regiment. In
Company C, the University of Ver
mont boys, gieat concern Is felt as to
whether they should take advantage
of the War Department order which
allows them to be mustered out of tin
service SeptemlKT tirst to resume
their college work.
The concensus of opinion Is that the
majority of these students will go
home, although the beueflt of a year's
experience of this nature would
without doubt, be looked back upon
as one of the most profitably spent
vears of their lives. Many of the
students have sought advice from tin
colonel, but he is loath to give It be
causo he believes this is a question
for thev themselves to decide. The
answer by no means has been found
and it is possible that they may de
clde to sta'.
Former Quartermaster Sergeant
Leon H. Boyd, who has been with the
regiment for more than ten years, has
been appointed second lieutenant of
the Supply Company.
He was thoroughly initiated by Ike
ollicers of the regiment. The initia
Hon consisted In a well worked up
lltlo program in which he was the
leading man. The tirst step was to
(online him In a guarded tent, from
which, however, he shortly escaped
only to be captured after a 200 yard
print
As a penalty for trying to get away
he was plastered With pancake flour.
Hv was then taken to the command
ing Officer Who was told that "It" had
been found to have in Its possession
a commission as second lieutenant in
the First Vermont Infantry.
The commanding oflicer was asked
if he could recognize "It", but he re
plieil that he could nl and suggested
that a bath might make the victim
easier to identify. The poor candl
date was rushed to the shower for
treatment, which by the way was
given without allowing him to remov.
a stitch of clothes.
He was men taken back and pre
sented to the commanding officer
this time to be recognized as th
new and verv welcome second lleuten-
and of the supply department
Then Given Uniform.
I he lieutenant was then given a
new uniform with ornaments which
distinguished an oflicer from an en

Bill in Equity Filed in Federal Court

BIG DEBT DUE AUGUST 31
Directors Conclude It Is Useless
to
Attempt to Renew $31,500,000
In Notea
Boston, Aug. 23. Receivership tor
the Bostcn and Maine railroad was
asked for in a hill in eouity filed In
the United States district court here
yesterday.
This action, in which the in
tercontinental rubber company of
New Jersey, which holds a note of
tlu road for $51,000, appears as
the
petitioner, was taken with the consent
Of all the directors of the Boston and
Maine, it is understood. No official
statement on this phase of the matter
could be obtained, but one of the di
rectors said it was a friendly proceed
Ing, Intended to simplify the task of
straightening cue the road's financial
tangle.
The board of directors, which for
two years has been trying to effect
a reorganization of the system, was
in session yesterday to consider its
procedure in connection with $13,500,-
nun of indebtedness falling due the
31st. Most of these obligations had
been extended from time to time,
while awaiting the outcome of plans
for reorganization. After a long meet
ing. the directors decided they had
reached the end of their rope,'' in the
words of one of their number, and Is
sued the lollowing statement, through
President J. II. Hustle:
lu the opinion of the directors
of the Boston and Maine railroad, it
is inexpedient to attempt a further re
newal of the notes falling due August
A creditors' petition for a receiv
er has been tiled In the United States
district court and in due time the Bos
ten and Maine will file its answer
thereto "
This answer, It was intimated last
night, would be made" within the
week. Whether any incidental ai
Hon would develop meantime was un
certain, although indications were not
lacking last night that certain of the
leased lines interests and virtually
decided to contest a proposal of re
ceivership.
