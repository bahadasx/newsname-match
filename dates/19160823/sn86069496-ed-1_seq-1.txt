stock men who contested for prem

satisfied with the results.

an experienced stockman, was the
Judge of all stock, and his decisions
were almost universally regarded as
correct, hence there are no sore spots

The baby shows proved of far more
interest than their most enthusiastic
friends had anticipated. Cn Thurs
day the contest was for baby boys un
der two years old, and several prom
ising youngsters were entered for the
prize, but the judges gave the decis
ion in favor of Mr. and Mrs. Cassius
Breeding's nine months old son
Four others received votes for second
choice, but being crowded and the
heat oppressive, no further time was
spent to place the red ribbon Mr. C
S. Harris, Manager of the contest- in
troduced Mr. J. E. Gowdy, who gave
the premium to Mr. and Mrs. Breed
ing and son, and we are indeed sorry
that we can not give his presentation
speech, but the picture of the little
one's future, his possibilities, and
what may be expected of him in later
life, together with a touching exhor
tation to the parents, presenting a
five dollar gold piece, made lasting im
pressions. On Friday under the same manager
the contest for the prettiest baby boy
undei fourteen months and also girl
under fourteen months, brought out a
fine number of pretty babies. Mr.
and Mrs. Breeding's son, won the
premium, and Mr. and Mrs. Kelley
Bell's son the red ribbon. The prem
ium for prettiest girl baby, Mr. and
Mrs. Geo Cheatham's daughter, and
Mr. and Mrs. A. R. Bishop's little
blackeyed daughter the red ribbon.
Much interest was shown in these
contests, but peace and good will pre
vailed. May God bless them all and
may we have many more such con
tests with a similar spirit shown, is
our desire.

Stopped at Jeff.
Mr Robert Epperson, who is teach
ing in an Indian reservation in West
ern Minnesota, reached home the
week of the Fair. He came to see his
fiauce, Miss Rose Conover, daughter
of J. Nick Conover. Arrangements
were soon perfected for their union

for the ceremony. This a very wor
thy couple and they have the best

An Accident
Last Friday afternoon, as the crowd
was coming in from the Fair, a mule
which was being driven by Mr. Boles
Finn, who was accompanied by his
wife, became scared near the residence
of Mr. Jo N. Conover, and started
running. Mr. Finn and his wife be
came alarmed and they jumped from
the buggy, Mrs. Finn getting one bone
in her right arm, below the elbow,
broken. The mute continued to run,
and upon reaching the Christian
church he ran into Mr. James Holla
day, Jr., who received painful in
juries, but not seriously hurt. The
mule was "badly hurt, by running into
Holladay's vehicle, a large hole being
cut in his side. The mule belonged
to Mr J. H. Smith, and while its
wound is serious, he will recover.
Died at Lekeiand.
Mr. J. H. Alcorn, of Lincoln county,
who spent the year of 1913 in Colum
bia, died at Lakeland Asylum one
day last week. His remains were con
veyed to Hustonville for interment.
He was a member of a prominent
family, but had been In feeble health
for several years. He was a half
brother of Mrs. A. Hunn, this place.
Rollin Reid, of Metcalfe county,
met with a very painful accident in
this county last week. He was with
a thresher and was at the home of
John Will Burbridge. While the ma
chine was in operation, he got his in
dex finger caught In the binder cut
ter, and it was almost severed.
When yoK take into consideration
the large number of automobiles that
ran constantly to and from the Fair
Grounds, it is remarkable that not an
accident occurred to a machine nor to
any one occupying same.
Tke fine brood mare which was
owned by Mr R. F. Paull died last
Saturday. It was in a meadow and
was grazing a short time before death.
The mare was very valuable .and had
brought a number of colts ..that sold
for fabulous prices.
Stolen Machine Recovered.
On the 12th of this month a man
giving his name as C. E Hes'on, hail
ing from Michigan, reached Colum
bia in a Burick car, a fine one. He
was anxious to sell and finally offered
to take $550 for it. Mr. Fred Myers,
knowing that it was a bargain, told
the man that he would pay him S50 in
cash and send him check for S500 when
he furnished proof that he was the
owner of the car. Upon those terms
the deal was closed and the man left,
promising to send in proof. Mr,
Myers then addressed letters to the
manufacturers, giving the details,
and Sunday a representative of the
owner came for the machine. It be
longs to Mr, S. M. Goodman, Hamil
ton, Ohio, and it was stolen from the
front of the courthouse, in that city,
on the 9th of this month. It was in
sured for $1,000, and the compaay
will return Mr. Myers his fifty dollars.'

Died at 87 Years.
Mr. 01 McCUster, who was in his
83th year, and who had been sick for
several months, died at his home, in
theFairplay, country, last Saturday
night at s o'clock. He was one of
the best known men in that part of
the county, and was a very excellent
citizen. The funeral and burial took
place late Sunday afternoon, a large
number of relatives and friends at
tending. He leaves a wife and quite
a number of sons and daughters, who
have the sympathy of the county.
Funeral was preached by Eld. F. J.
Barger, and the speaker stated that
the deceased had been a member of
the church for 54 years.
Mr. P. F. Spuires and wife, of the
Milltown section, were visitors at the
News office last Saturday and while
in conversation the road question
came up. Mr. Squires is not only for
the railroad, but for better public
roads as well. He is not well pleased
with the present condition and states
that he favors the repeal of the stock
law or require overseers of the road to
clear the brtash and briars from crowd
ing the public pass ways.
Rev. Geo. A. Joplin, representing
the Kentucky Sunday-School Associa
tion, will be in Columbia to-day (Wed
nesday,) the 23rd. He has called two
meetings, at the Presbyterian church,
one at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the
other at 8 p. m. He wants to meet
all the Sunday-school in town and
those near enough to attend. AIL
Sunday-school workers are urged to
be present.
The Columbia Fair was a success in
every particular. The attendance
was large and there was more stock
here than for many years. Xo year in
the past was the fair at Columbia a
failure. The Association has never
failed to make money, and it has been
one of tne best attended Fairs in the
State.
Tuesday night of last week, while
a terrific storm was raging, lightning
struck the comb of the Presbyterian
church, this place, ran down and into
the vestibule, doing slight damage.
It also struck a pine tree in Mrs. Ann
Lizzie Walker's yard, almost demol
ishing it.
McCandless & Reed sold their bot
tling plant at Lebarjon last week and
gave possession. They got a fancy
price. They will now push the busi
neas of their plant at this place.
