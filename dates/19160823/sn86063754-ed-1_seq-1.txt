Mrs. Edna Funderburk Favors
Germany and Condemns
England
Mrs. Edna V. Funderburk, the
well known writer of prose and
poetry, whose home is near
Dudley, writes The Journal a
ittle of what she thinks of the
conduct of Germany and Eng
and in the Great War:
Now as I understand it and
see it about all of the newspapers
in our country are in sympathy
with the Allies in the European
War; and I have wondered why.
I meet a great maDy people and
[>eople of intelligence too who
io not hesitate to say that they
ympathize with Germany and
he fact ils I don't remember havng
met but one since that was
itarted who favored the Allies.
Mow, I have been informed that
fEngland and her Allies are now
Catholic and that Germany is
freer from Catholicism than any
country on earth?ours not excepted.
If I ever had any sympathy
for England it is gone
since she so heartlessly put to
death the Irishmen who led that
rebellion. I have been inform
ed in many ways that England
greatly oppresses Ireland, and
has done so through many years.
I gather that Ireland only stays
under her rule because she can-,
not help her self.
These people who tried to get
out from under that iron rule
had as much right to do what
they did as we Southerners had
to try to come from the North,
perhaps even more because perhaps
England oppresses them
more than the North did the
South before the War. If after
the North won in the strife they
l had taken Lee and Davis, (leadvers
in the rebellion) -and put
Ithem to death do you suppose
Bvve would have been the united
Kountry we are today? Well, I
Won't. We might have been
Bighting until yet. And now, I
believe that England by doing
tbu: awful deed has sounded her
I own doom. She may win in
' this fight, I do not know, but
sooner or later she will pay for
her awful deed and Day dearly.
Venganceis some times slow
but it is sure and when she
comes she pays in an hundred
fold. Now some of our papers
are trying to find something to
admire in England's deed! They
remind me of the old lady who
was so gentle that she always
spoke good of every body and
never spoke evil, no matter what
they did. So one day some one
tried to see if they could get her
| to speak evil of the devil. Thev
made some remark in her pres!
ence about the old imp's rascality.
Well, out of force of habit
I suppose, she took up for him
and told them she greatly ad
mired his perseverance. I'll admit
that the devil is not la/.y, but
I don't like him for all that
and I'm not going to try to defend
him.
It seems to me that some of
the things that have been said
in an attempt to defend Eng
land's act sounds very weak.
Now, I do hope the Deutsli
land will get safely home and I
Would like to have had the
chance to wish her Captain God
speed. May the good Lord
watch over her as she goes down
into the water as he watched
over Jonah.
I don't believe the grand sturdy
Irishmen died in vain, and
some dav this world will see
their deaths paid for.

Fist Fight Feature of Campaign
Meeting
The State Campaign meeting j
for Chesterfield county was held <
at the county seat last Thnrsday. i
A large crowd was in attend- 1
ance, and the various candidates 1
presented their claims and the <
day passed off quietly, save a fist j
fight at the rear of the speaker's 1
platform, {l'he reporter for the 1
Columbia State gave the follow- l
ing account of the meeting: <
Chesterfield, Aug. 17.?Anoth- i
er fist fight' featured the campaign
meeting here today, the 1
combatants being E. C. L. Ad- 1
i:t ii * . .
uiua, tuuuiuaie iui licuieuam i
governor, and L. A. Wilkes of 1
Darlington, who championed the 1
cause of Andrew J. Bethea. Dr. s
Adams was the second speaker, i
following his opponent, Mr. Be 1
thea. The concluding portion of <
Dr. Adams* speech was a joke 1
about a negro*s pig in a bag be 1
coming a puppy at the other end I
of the line. In aplying this to the <
conduct of Mr. Bethea, Dr. Ad I
ams said he didn't 4'care to have <
anything to do with any man 1
who was a christian at one end
of the line and a crook at the s
other." Dr. Adams was walk- 4
ing to the door at the back of ]
the stage with these as his con- i
, eluding words when he was in- t
. . i t n.ii ?.i .
icitcpicu uy mi. JDtuieu, who 1
asked what was that he had said. *
"I said it.'vDr. Adams replied. ?
Instantly Mr. Wilkes flashed ]
through the doorway and landed
a heavy blow on Dr. Adam's <
chin. The two clincned and <
fell to the floor before others 1
could intervene. They strug- <
gled and writhed until t*?ev were 5
dragged apart. In the afternoon
Mr. Wilkes was fined $10.
The Darlington county man
said he had known Mr. Bethea a
number of years ago when the
two were small boys in school,
but that they had not been together
since. He said he had
championed the cause of Mr.
Bethea of his own initiative.
Barring this incident the day
was of the conventional order.
John T. Duncan injected a
colloquy with Former Gov.
Blease. Mr. Blease had told
how George Young of Laurens
county, "a Confederate veteran."
had been murdered. Mr. Duncan
declared that the victim
was not a Confederate veteran.
Mr. Blease referred the case to
R. A. Cooper, solicitor of the
Eighth circuit, who prosecuted
the murderer.
"If the facts are not as I have
stated, I'll withdraw the race and
disgrace myself for life by vo
| ting for Dick Manning for governor,"
said Mr. Blease.
Mr. Duncan interrupted Mr.
Cooper long enough today to
ask Mr. Cooper if Young was a
Confederate veteran. "He was
not a Confederate veteran," Mr.
Cooper promptly replied. Mr.
Duncan thanked Mr. Cooper
and added that he had made
j Gov Manning at least one vote.
It was charged today that Dr.
C. Fred Williams, against whom
so much denunciation has been
directed, is not the superintendent
of the State Hospital for the
Insane after ad. "He's no more
superintendent than jou are,"
Mr. Blease told ihp Ctw
crowd. Brains to direct the
whole affair, he charged, are
supplied by "a Yankee subordinate."
The voters were warned
there was likelihood that the
election would be stolen this
year "as in 1914."

Fight at Bear Creek
Patrick, Aug:. 16.?As the result
of a free-for-all fight at Bear
3reek school house five
niles west of Patrick Tuesday,
P. W. D. McLean was sent to
he hospital at Ilamlet, N- C.,
5n the afternoon train with three
severe knife wounds, one in the
left breast and two in the back.
W. D. Jones suffered a broken <
aose and other bruises and sev- <
sral other participants received
minor wounds.
The patron? of the school i
had met to decide on a location
for a new school building. It
seems there was some ill feeling
between those who recently
iroted iu favor of a bond issue <
md those opposing it, but the
mmediate cause of the difficuly
appears to have come from a i
iispute and the passing of severe
words between G. E. McLean,
who is a son of P. W. D.
VIcLean, and Frank Jones, when
)n their way home from church
Monday night, the fathers being
irawn into the difficulty when
hey met at the school house
Tuesday. i
'Xhey are not supporting me,"
Mr. Manning said. "They know ,
what I have done for them and

Looks Like Second Race Bej.
tween Manning and Blease
e Columbia, S. C. Aug. 19??Ten
h days before the primary election
^ in South Carolina there is every
V
v indication that there will be a
e second race between Richard I.
n Manning, incumbent and C. L.
e Blease, former Governor for
lt Governor of the State. This
e prediction made two weeks ago
caused a storm ot protest on the
e part of the press of the State supe
porting Robert A. Cooper.
r- However, every fact connected
with the situation would indi
" cate that the present Governor
^ and the former Governor will
e
n ngnt it out m a second primary.
It has been the custom in
South Carolina to arrant Govern*
2 ors two terms. No man has
ever Leen elected Governor a
g
s third term and this fact will lose
;r many.votes to Mr. Blease, who
y. it must be said has been con!
ducting his campaign this year
r, on a much different basis as
rs compared with previous efforts,
l- Mr. Manning has been stand
c_ ing squarely on his record and
has not assailed any of his opponents
in bitter language. The
;s Governor firmly believes that
v the people of the State will not
repudiate his program of progressive
legislation. He will go ing
to the election with all the facts
k known by the people and will
e depend on their erood iudfrement.
n Robert A. Cooper of Laurens
^ is a clean and good man. One
[e of his ardent admirers said not
long ago: "Bob Cooper is as
- clean as a hound'*, tooth." He
may be the choice of the people
at some date not far distant.
As the election time draws
nearer the people in all sections
of the State are beginning to
realize that Manning is the man
most likely to defeat Bleaseism
in South Carolina. No matter
what some may say Blease is
still an issue in South Carolina
politics. He will always be more
or less an issue. Or rather his
record as the chief executive of
the State will always be an issue.
During the past week at least
two candidates have declared
against the policies of government
as expounded by Mr.
Blease. One of these men was
Mr. Cooper.
Practically every fair minded
man in South Carolina will
agree that Mr. Manning has
made a good Governor. His
record is open to the world.
Nothing has been concealed.
There has been no secret alignments
between the Governor
and corporations. In fact a
great majority of the bankers of
the State are fighting: Mr. Manning
simplv because he is trying
to apply a just and equitable tax
law to the banking institutions.
Governor Manning has given
much of his time and attention
to laws that will benefit the
great mass of mill workers in
South Carolina. He urged the
passage and approved the weekly
pav act. He approved the
anti-docking law. During Governor
Manning's administration
a law has been passed to prevent
negroes from working in textileplants
with white people.

Negroes Engage in Pistol Battle
Near Lancaster
Chester, Aug. 20^?Robert L.
Pierson, superintendent of the
Hardaway Contracting company's
big force of workmen erecting
the great dam across Catawba
'river at Nitrolee for the
Southeren Power company, was
shot to death at 2:30 o'clock this
morning. Owing to the inaccessibility
of the place it was
difficult to secure the complete
details of the tragedy.
Sheriff D E. Colvin and den
uties and Coroner J. Henry
Gladden left for the scene early
this morning. It is said that
Superintendent Pierson was
awakened early this morning by
a bedlam of noise over in the
negro camp. The negroes who
were boisterous are said to have
been intoxicated. The superintendent,
it is said, went to request
them to cease and when he reached
the scene of the noise, there
was a fusillade of pistol shots
and in the storm of bullets Superintendent
Pierson sustained a
wound in his left side and died
five minutes later. Three negroes
were seriously wounded
and it is thought that two of
them will die.

Senate Passes Ship Bill After
Bitter Contest
Washington, Aug. 18.?The
Government shipping bill passed
the Senate tonight by a vote
of 38 to 21, encfing one of the
most bitterly contested- legist- ^ ^ ~
tive struggles of the Wilson Administration.
In the last Congress
the measure precipitated a
Democratic revolt and a filibuster
which forced postponement
of many important bills, but revised
so as to minimize the Government
operation feature, received
today unanimous Democratic
support and solid Republican
opposition. It already had
passed the House.
The shipping bill provides for
creation of a Government shipping
board to acquire and operate
for rehabilitation of the
American merchant marine and
appropriates $50,000,000 for the

of Panama Canal bonds.
Several important amendments
were agreed to just before
the final vote, among them one
would reduce the salary of the
shipping board members from
$10,0<>0 to $7,500 a year. Other
amendments passed included
one which would authorize the
President to seek adjustment of
foreign discrimination against
American shipping through dip
louianc negotiations anil 10 take
retaliatory action if such negotitions
fail. Another would authorize
the Treasury to withhold
clearance from masters of
vessels who deliberately refuse
to accept freight from American
citizens without satisfactory reasons.
