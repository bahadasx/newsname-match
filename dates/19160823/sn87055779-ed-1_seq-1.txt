"out of trie hundreds of rases

Iuter:ijii'n.il News rrvie:
WASHINGTON'. Aus. 2 Sett le
nient of all iiiestioris in dispute be
tween the present le facto govern
ment of Meb'o and the United
States is expected by I'res't Wilson
before election. SVc'y of State Lan
sing and Ainliass;idor-Dosi?nate Ar
redrmdo planned to confer today to
perfect arrangements for the meet
ings of the joint commission. It is
expected that Asbury Park or some
nearby New Jersey summer resort
will he chosen as the meeting place.
This will put the commission close
to the summer white house so that
Pros' t Wilson will be available at all
times for consultation. Ambassador
Designate Arredondo also will move
his staff to the place selected so
that he ran keep Gen. Carranza fully
advised of everything that is joins'
on.
The commission as finally select
ed is admittedly one of the strongest
that yet has passed upon Mexican
affairs, and its personnel is as fol
lows: American section Franklin D.
Lane, secretary of th interior;
Judpe (JeorKe Gray of Delaware, re
tired federal jurist and sinco 190"
a member of the international court
of arbitration under The Hai;ue con
vention: John 11. Mott. Koneral sec
retary of the international Y. M. C.

The first task of the commission
Will 1 if to fleeidt wht-tlipr tVi 1 'e r-
shiny- expedition shall be withdrawn!
from Mexico. It is considered cer
tain that this will be agreed on
speedily. It is also expected that a
neutral zone will be tlxed early in
the negotiations into which tho
American or Mexican forces can be
hurried to stop bandit raids. On this
point k'ook'rabhical considerations
will probably prove the only stumb
ling block. With the military situa
tion out of the way it is fxpected
that the commission will take up
the question of financing tho iros-
ent government. It is believed a
plan will he developed which will
make it possible for this government
a.ein to interest capital in Mexican
affairs and to set money to pay off
all existing claims so that a fresh
start can I e made by the southern
republic.
The time of the first meeting will
be arranued between Sec'y Iininf?

German Diplomat Says Money
and Beautiful Women Have
Been Used to Influence
Public Officials.
RFULIX, Aug. -ZZ That t
bribes have been given to Rouman
ian politicians l.y the entente powers
to win the Mipport of the Buchar
est government is the charge made
by a diplomatists interviewed by the
Overseas News agency.
"lioumanic--'s attitude is a conse
quence of the country's geograhpic
al location," the diplomat is quot
ed as saying. "It is surrounded on
all sides by belligerents .Roumanian
statesirren therefore are guided by
their desire to spare their country
damage which would be unavoidable
if it became a war theater.
"Since the beginning of the pres
ent conflagration the entente haa
been extremely active in Iloumania,
especially Russia. All Roumania is
flooded with Russian spies and
agents of all descriptions. The en
tente uses money lavishly in order
to bribe politicians and buy news
papers. Kmploy Reautiful Women.
"The entente further employed
beautiful women to influence public
opinion and leading men. This agi
tation reached its height at the be
ginning of the last Russian offen
sive. At the same time the entente
announced an offensive by Gen. Sar
rail (on the Saloniki front), which
was undertaken purely for political
purposes.
"Now the Bulgarians have made
a quick and successful advance and
the Russian offensive is apparently
slackening. At present Roumania
is still undecided and probably will
not give up the well calculated, clev
er neutrality which up to the present
has Lrought enormous iower to the
country, unless it thinks that the
really decisive turn has been reach
ed in the war. In the meantime
trade relations between the central
powers and Roumania continue nor
mal and active.
"Roumania has been a sphynx. It
is still shrouded with a mysterious
veil behind which political passion
and agitations, not only of Rou
manians, bu also of the entente
agents, are i.t the highest pitch."

lr:tern.itiiuil News Serviee:
WASHINGTON, Aujr. 23. The rci: iia.Rb-.ii intats hihinJ
the railways of the country are now reaching , Jedsion whether
they will accept tlie demand of Pres't Wilson to aree to an eiht
hoiir work day at a lo-hour wage rate to prevent a general rail
road strike. While they are doing so the railway presidents now
here are sparring the time. A definite decision hardly will be
reached before Friday and may be deferred until early next week.
But intimations reaching here from New York and Chicago make
it plain that eventually Pres't Wilson will secure recognition ot the
main points of his demand and the railroads will have laid the
foundation tor permanency in settling wage disputes.
Following today's session of the
sub-comnvttee of the raliroad presi
dents which has been authorised to
arrange an agreement, if possible,
the following statement was b sued:
"A meeting of the presidents and
managers was held this morning
and a recess taken until 6 o'clock.
"Chairman Holden stated that the
report being circulated that any
conclusion had been reached, was
incorrect."
Pass Decision Along.
Following the official announce
ment it was learned that the execu
tives of the majority of the railroads
had passed" the decision" alons to
their executive committees and wero
forced to await their respective de
cisions. That decision may come
shortly, but the majority of the rail
way chiefs here expect that it may
be withheld until next week.
For obvious reasons the r.iilway
chiefs refused to admit o!!ic;ally
what was transpiring, but it wa-s
plain from their attitude that they
felt hopeful that, in accepting"
eventually tho olficial plan, they will
line the president up for a program
of legislation that will result in th
