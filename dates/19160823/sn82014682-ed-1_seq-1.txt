Union Heads Say Railroads Dis
posed to Sacrifice Point of
Increase to Save 10 Hours
PRESIDENT AnFtWO
CONGRESSMEN CONFER
Chairmen of House and Senate
Commerce Committees Dis
cuss Situation With Wilson
,, (AssoeUted Press by Federal Wireless)
WASHINGTON, D. X, Aug. 23.
The railroad strike crisis was more
tense today with the acknowledg
ment by leaders of the brotherhoods
that ft Js getting difficult to hold the
men, who. are demanding action in
consonance with the strike vote which
they took. The negotiations, with the
railroad operators are said to be pros
pectlve of so much delay that the unl
on leaders are finding the men rest
less as the days pass.
Union men say that the railroads
are disposed to disregard the sacrifice
by the employes of their demand for
time and a half for overtime. .
The railroad operators, on their
side. .maintain that the increased ex
penses involved in accepting the eight
tiour day demanded by the men must
be met by Increased charges, other
wise the roads will be forced Into a
receivership. ' ;
President Wilson, Chairman New-
. lands of the senate Interstate com
merce committee, and Chairman
Adamson of the house committee on
' Interstate and foreign commerce, con
ferred today on the strike situation.
A reply from the railroad men to the
statement of the president at the con
ference on Monday Is still awaited.
Hale Holden, president of the Chi
cago, Burlington, Qulncy Railroad;
Robert S. Lovett, head of -the Jlarrl-
man system, and Daniel Wlllard, pres
ident of the Baltimore & Ohio Rail
road, held a lengthy conference with
Mr. .Wilson at the White House yes
terday. It la understood, that they dis
cussed general conditions wun .me
rresldent, going over some of the dif
ficulties in ; the way of granting the
demand for an eight-hour day and
time and a half for all overtime, made
by the members of the brotherhoods.
Expect Nation to Intervene.
While . no authoritative statement
Mas issued from the headquarters of
the railroad presidents, yesterday. It
Is understood that they are disposed
to prolong the negotiations in the
. hope that the business men of the na
tion wlir come to their support and
voice a strong opposition to the eight-
hour . day demand. It was asserted
that it is this that is causing the an
swer to the president's proposal to
hang fire for so long, hut it was also
asserted in some circles last night
that the reply cannot be delayed much
longer, and may be looked for within
a short time, possibly today.:
The members of the railroad broth
erhood committee here issued a state
ment last night in which they asserted
that the plea tor arbitration made by
the railroads is only a scheme to gain
time and to deceive the public.
Roads Refused to Arbitrate, v
The statement insists that the roads
have, on several questions and at dif
ferent times in the past, flatly re
fused to arbitrate, and that they are
even now excluding negro firemen and
brakeinen from the benefits of the ne
gotiations under way. -
The statement also points out that
the demands of the men were known
la general , to the : officials some
months ago, hut they did nothing to
meet them until forced to do so. -
