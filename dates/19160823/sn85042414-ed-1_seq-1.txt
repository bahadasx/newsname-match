IN PRISON CAMPS
Hundreds of Thousands still
in Danger from Turks,
Official Says.
London, Aug. 28-—The Rev. Harold
Buxton, secretary of the Armenian
refugees fund, has Just returned to
England after devoting three months
to relief work In the devastated vil
lages. In an Interview the Rev. Mr.
Buxton gave details which entirely
confirm the grave statements made
by Lord Bryce some months ago In
the house of lords. Asked whether
he had any proof that the deporta
tion of Armenians last summer was
due to German Instigation, he said:
"All I can say is that the German
government did nothing to stop the
massacres. During the whole business
German influence was supreme at
Constantinople, and German consuls
were at their posts in all the chief
centers through ABla Minor. Besides,
the people were swept away with a
methodioal thoroughness which one
does not expect from the Turk, who,
when left to himself, acts rather-with
sudden simakis of -fury.
"I have'evldence from an American
missionary that certain of the German
consuls did their best on behalf of the
Armenian people. For instance, the
German consul at Erzerum wired to
his ambassador In Constantinople vig
orously protesting at the order of de
portation. He received a reply In
these words: "We cannot interfere
In the internal affairs of Turkey.'
"I don't think there has been any
exaggeration as to losses as published
In. England. The Armenian race num
bered over 4,000,000, of whom 2,000,
000 were Turkish Armenians, and of
these perhaps 1,000,000 have been de
ported and 500,000 massacred. Only
200.000 escaped into the mountains,
and so across to Russian soil. There
are some hundreds of thousands In
concentration camps between Aleppo
and Mosul and in the neighboring
regions of Mesopotamia,, where Tur
key continues to be supreme over
their fate.
"To this considerable population we
have no access, and it Is still in dan
ger. According to reports which
come through. It Is being ravaged by
sickness, famine, privations of all
kinds, outrages, and murder, all of
which means high mortality among
the victims."

CHATEAJJ_ON SOMME
Son, In French Army, Knew the Ger

fMm Her Home.
Paris, Aug. 8, (by mail)—The
Chateau La Maisonnette, so often
named in recent bulletins on the
Somme fighting, is the property of
Mme. Fernet, who has lived there for
many years. The property is close to
Blaches and Peronne. The owner was
there in August, 1914, when Von
Kluck's forces passed through during
their rush upon Paris. She remained
in her house and for months after
ward no news was heard of her. One
of her sons, Victor Fernet, son-in-law
of Gen. Boisdeftre, although free from
military obligations, volunteered at
the beginning of the war, and the
hazards of war sent him recently to
the Somme front, where he has shar
ed in all the attacks made.
A letter from Germany had inform
ed -him that his mother, who had re
mained until a short time ago at La
Maisonnette, had been sent away- with
almost all her aged servants, so that
he was able to take part in an attack
which meant the destruction of his
home without the fear that his moth
er was still there.
The Germans made six desperate
efforts to retake La Maisonnette be
tween 11 p. m- Sunday (July 16) and
Monday afternoon. Each was made
iby at least a battalion, but each was
defeated.

Discontent Spreading Rap*
idly—Possible Legisla

Washington, Aug. 23.—"Hie rail
road employes' committee showed
such marked signs of unrest today
at the delay in the negotiations
between President Wilson and the
railway executives, that the leaders
of the men became alarmed and
openly expressed fears of their abil
ity to hold the men much longer.
The employes' meeting was thrown
into an uproar by speeches of the
minority demanding immediate ac
tion unless the roads accept Wil
son's plan, but tbe leaders suc
ceeded in adjourning the meeting
before any vote was taken on the
various proposals. Some of the
men urged that most of them go
home, leaving the brotherhood
heads with authority to imii the
strike if the railroads do not accept
Wilson's plan.
The meeting adjourned to
morrow morning. Frequently Jwmi..'
and applaose were heard a block
from the hall.
"It is our belief," said

"Discontent among the men Is

Washington, Aug. 23.—President
Wilson summoned Senator Kewlandi
and Representative Adamson, chair
men of the senate and house com
merce commissions, to the White
House today. It is understood that
he planned to discuss with them legis
lation on the railroad strike situation.
The president plans for a settlement
of the dispute, which would create a
commission to Investigate the working
of an eight-hour day and collateral
issues.
Men Are Impatient.
Meantime, the men, tired of the de
lay due to the railroad representa
tives' prolonged discussion of Wilson's
plan, gave free expression to their
opinions of today's meeting.
The men felt the railroads show a
disposition to disregard their sacrifice
of the demand for time and a half
overtime.
A. B. Garretson advised patience,
predicting action soon.
"The situation is in the hands of
President Wilson and until he acts
there is nothing for us to do," said
Garretson.
Other leaders said plans were mads
for instant action in case the railroad
managers decline Wilson's proposal.
Reedy to Act.
Xewlands and Adamson, after the
conference with Wilson, declared that
they approved the president's pro
posal and that they were ready to
push any needed legislation-
Further, they would not discuss
the conference. it is understood,
however, that the creation of a per
manent commission to investigate fu
ture controversies was one of the sub
jects discussed.
The bill adding two members to the
Interstate Commerce commission,
which already passed the house and
comes before the senate Friday, also
was discussed at the conference. It
Is understood definitely today that the
railroad executives decided to act as
a unit in handling the present situa
tion.
The program of the railroad execu
tives today was to deal first with the
principle of arbitration and afterward
with the eight-hour day.
If means can be found for guaran
teeing arbitration in future disputes,
at least some of the railroad execu
tives favor acqulescense with the
eight-hour demand.
It was declared in administration
circles today that both Wilson and the
railroad executives seemed on a way
to an agreement.
President Wilson expects another
eall from the committee of railroad
executives some time before tomor
row.
Men Are Restless.
Restlessness on the part of the men.
who openly declare the railroads are
"playing Wilson for more time," be

today. One leader said, "We ean prob
ably hold the men here another day
