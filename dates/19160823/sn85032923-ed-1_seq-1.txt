"This is not an ordinary campaign
Wc arc to determine whether or not
wc arc to halt prosperity. A new
Europe will emerge from the war that
must be met by a new America. Wc
cannot meet the exigencies before us
unless wc have patriotic conscious
ness, power and unity. I desire to
sec a dominant sense of national
unity rising above the race creed and
inspiring a single desire to build up
and maintain the honor and prosper
ity of the United States."
He spoke of conditions of com
merce after the war. "Let the United
States take count of her resources,
strength and capacity for co-opera
tion and self-knowledge. It is not a
question of a few years. Wc must
plan long ahead. Wc should protect
human rights, safety and comfort. I
regard human rights as paramount.
Wc should protect women and chil-
urcn. wc cannot altord to trine with
a future race. I believe wc arc past
the time when community interests
should be ignored. I am against the
abuse of community interests for the
sake of private advantage. I did
something in New York along that
line and have not changed my mind."
