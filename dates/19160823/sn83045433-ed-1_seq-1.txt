AUTO JOLTS HI LEG OF.
One Wemaa Paints, But Revves to
Learn. It Is Cork.
Pittsburgh, Aug. 22.-Several hundred
perSons stood aghast when a leg, weU
stockinged and shod, fell from an auto
mobile that sped by the Pennsylvania
Railroad depot. A woman fainted and
was revived in time to see the auto re
in turning.
"Has anyone seen a leg around here?"
asked an elderly man, leaning out the
car. "Ah, thanks," he added, gratefully,
as a man who had been bold enough to
pick up the leg handed it to him. A
jolt knocked off my cork l-g. Thanks
- again. If you ever lose a leg in my town.
let me know if I can be of service to
Iyou."
