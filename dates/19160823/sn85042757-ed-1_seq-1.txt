ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE, j
Will Hold Services in Baptist Church, !
Sunday, September 3
Dm tl M U ominnrrl FioM airi-
tary of the Anti-Saloon League, was ,
here Friday and Saturday and arranged '
. q D.rmn.ihi nn nrnhihitmn and
civic righteousness, Sunday, Septem
ber 3, in the Baptist church
This is the first time the Anti-Saloon
League has done any work or held ser
vices in Crossville for many years and
should interesc our people to the ex
tent ot bringing out a large crowd.
The talk will be delivered by Kev.
G. M. Haanond, field secretary, or
Rve. J. D. McAllister, State Superin
tendent. It will be in the nature of a
sermon-lecture, will be entirely non
sectarian and non-partisan. In other
words it is simply a fight against whis
key and its attendant evils and an
effort to bild up in our community a
stronger sentiment for moral living
and civic righteousness. The very
spirit of it must appeal to all whc fa
vor clean living, both public and pri
vate, and the strengthening of every
element that makes for higher living.
There are few towns the size of
Crossville anywhere thai have less law
violating, but it has come to the editor
of this paper that as Crossville has
been cleaned up the lawless element
has grown bolder and more lawless in
the rural sections of the county.
The coming meeting should result in
the putting on foot some measures that
mill ovtonrt to the whole county the
same measure of regard and respect
tor the law that prevails in Crossville.
The law-abiding people from all parts
of the county should turn out to this
meeting as thrre is almost sure to be
presented ideas and features relative
to cleaning up and keeping cleaned up
every rural section of our county. If
the people who favor law enforcement
do not take enough interest in good or
der to join forces, seek the best meth
ods of suppressing the bootlegging and
its attendant evils, there is little hope
for our county as a whole being cleaned
up in the sense it should be. In other
words it is up to the people.
ROAD WORK
Rains Have Hindered Progress, But It Is
Being Pushed Fast as Possible
The work on the Dixie Short Route
highway north to the Fentress county
line is now beyond Isoline, within six
miles of the Fentress county line.
While none of the work is finally com
pleted teams can travel the road ex
cept at such sections are as near uncom
pleted work on bridges.
The work on the east end of the
Memphis-to-Bristol highway is being
pushed as rapidly as possible, but ex
cessive rains have retarded the work
there the same as in tire north part of
the countv. I he road fa now largely
completed to within a mile or less ot
Ozone,
There has recently been some talk
that the Dixie Short Route out of
Crossville south will follow the Grassy
Cove road some six miles and then bear
to the right and pass thn ugh Linaria
and go down Devil Step Hollow into
Sequatchee valley. Some reasons as
signed for such a course are : It will
give several miles of the road in the
airection of Grassy Cove, will cause
the road to enter the Valley at its head
ana ionow it u.c uw. ..
follow it the entire distance to
Fikeville, whereas, the other way the
F,keville, whereas, the otMr way
road would enter the valley some two , kjnd ot fo0(J equaijng it in any way,
or three miles below the head and Dut jt ia best to be used for fresh eat
cause the head-of-the-valley people to 1 mg as when cured it drips the fat away

rection from what they really wish to
go to strike the Dixie in coming to
Crossville. At the same time there
are good steel bridges over Byrds
Creek and Daddys Creek, which will
save a large expenditure for bridges. If

HOGS FATTEN AT SMALL COST
Reasons Briefly Explained and Situation
Wade blear,
Some people are slow to believe the '.
actual conditions relative to hog rais-
' "c " "c
quently stated in a brief manner. For
LUat icaouil w o .nan gajjioiu nv
benefit of those who are not familliar
with conditions here.
TIMEBERED COUNTRY.
This being a timbered country and
most of the timber being the various
kinds of oaks, every one will under
stand that the larger part of the feed
for hogs comes from acorns.
ll A ..... ntn.lf avnlnin l.if tVtA
SWEET MAST.
For several years the marketable
white oak and post oak has been in
course of being put on the market as
lumber and railroad cross ties. That
has removed the larger part of the
large and healthy trees of those two
kinds, but it has left many small and
inferior trees ot that kind. The re
moving of the large trees has caused
the smaller trees to produce many
more acorna than all the timber pro
duced betore, just as thinning an orch
ard that stands too thick will cause a
larger crop of fruit. What is known
as "Sweet Mast" comes in a large
measure from the oaks named. The
sweat mast is so called because the
acorns are pood fattening feed for hogs
as soon as ;hey fall, and the Sweet
Mast is fir!; of the acorns to fall.
There is also i small nut, the chinqui-
pin, similar I taste to a cncsinui, mat
grows here in profusion in places,
which is also ciaesedas sweet mast and
is very fatten: at? for hogs.
B1T-EK MAST.
Wnat Is know., as "Bitter Mt" u
t iiu v . - i
the acorns that grow on black oak, red
.1
oak, spotted oak, chestnut oak, and
some oLr kinds of oaks. The reason
thiu is railed "Bitter Mast" IS that
is called Bitter Mast hhw
when it falls it is bitter and hogs will
not eat it readily. After it has lain a effective and enduring,
nuicm ihmu , It vou are in favor of better roads,
few weeks and has been trozen the t Tbuiiday, August 31, and
freezing kills the bitterness and sweet- j ,end a nand to put the M.-to-B. high
ens it. After being sweetened by j Way in good shape, bring along a big
freezing hogs eat it read.ly and fatten basket of lunch and sone , tool to work

later than the Sweet Mast and for that
reason provides a later feed for hogs.
This Bitter Mast will remain good un
til ltgrows the following season and
hntrs keeD tat on it until in May. Very
little of the Bitter Mast oaks have
been cut because the demand for that
class of timber has been small and the
price low. As the price ot timber ad
vances and as the railroads build cre
osoting vats for treating ties made
from these oaks which does not have
to be clone in the case of the white and
post oaks the price for thase oak ties
that have been non-marketable will ad
vance. There is every indication now
that this inferior class of oaks will
very soon bring such a price as will
make it profitable to market the tim
bre. In some places in this county
there is now standing more of this in
ferior class of oak trees than there
ever has been of the better grade of
timber In some instances tne ties
will be removed at a profit sufficient to
pay the present price of the land.
In rare instances the acorn crop will
be damaged by an unusual dry spell or
the tree may fail to produce just as
any other trees may fail to produce its
fruit. With a well distributed rainfall
of 50 to 60 inches each year, it will be
seen that the years when there will be
a mast failure are very rare.
SLFEND1D MEAT.
I u . M. ,na tpnm raaBt ( the
13-otM. No other
Yot most of the Deonie here
get their entire pork supply out of the
woods. When the hogs are fed a little
coin or cotton seed meal, before butch
ering, the flesh becomes hardened and
the meat is then most . excellent in
every way.
When the mast fails which it rarely
does to the point where the hogs can
not live, even tnougn -ney uo
i fat enough for butchering the owners

losing their noK1inrou8nnmBa"",m

ones should be caught and marked and
a general oversight kept of them. By
being looked after they remain tamer

LARGE PROFITS
Thereare many farmers in this coun

of hogs out of the woods last year.
One man sold $3,000 worth and he has

is one of the most profitable industries
of this section and so easy is it to raise
hogs here that the farmer who does i
not have enough for his meat is looked
upon as being very shiftless.
Fully $75,000 m hogs was taken out
of the woods here the past year, and
well informed men say there are more
hogs in the woods now than ever be
fore. ROAD WORKING.

COMMENDS OUR ARTICLE
Also Gives Interesting Light on Range
Question as Seen by a Westerner.
1 he following letter by E. L. Lem-
- -
ert is especially timely for several rea-
sons: ic gives otners an unuciv.im-
" . jn
ng ot how a man who has spent many
years in the west views conaiuons
here. It also explains in a very clear
and logical manner the "range" ques-
which has been something of a
-ystery to persons not tami.liar with
the conditions here. The letter by
Mr. Lemert follows:
editor of the Chronicle :
Your article in last week's issue
on the advantages and possibilities ot
this county suggested to me that the
experieaHof a western man who had
located here, might be of interest and
benefit to some of your readers, who
might be looking for a desirable place
to make a home.
About ten years since, while in
northeast Kansas, 1 became impressed
with the advancing values of all live
stock and the narrowing margin be
tween stocker and fattened or finished
animals, caused by the steadily de
creasing production of meat animals.
Being familiar, through army exper
ience, with the well distributed rainfall
of the Cumberland mountain region
and knowing how important a tactor
an abundant and well distributed rain
fall was in grazing, I began an investi
gation of the Appalachian mountain
region.
Aware that the state experiment
I .,,, thaari ,,rh
data with
crops and
climatic conditions.
I I I iipd theVir -
1 visitea tne vir
ginia experiment staton, Blacksburg.
Va and later the fenneasw) experi
ment station, Knoxville, Tenn.
At the Tennessee station after Frof.
H. A. Morgan, director of the station,
had given tome several bulletins along
the line of my inquiry, he suggested to
me that before leaving Tennessee, 1
visit the Cumberland plateau and
stated that, in his opinon, the Cumber
land plateau afforded the best oppor
tunity for stock raising in Tennessee
and possibly in the United States.
Acting on his suggestion 1 came to
crossville and spent a number of days
v -1 i
j looking over the plateau.
. -.-
While I was cognizant that the pla
teau was defined by the dictionary as
"a broad fiat body of land in an ele
vated position."
I had regarded it as rather the name
of a re; ion, like the Shenandoah Val
ley of Virginia, through which I had
passed, and round not to be a vailey of
a stream but a name given to a broad
belt of rolling country lying between
the
Blue KiUge and the Allegheny
,n.i.,ta;na The dictionary haa tne
Cumberland plateau properly de
scribed. 1 LIKED IT.
IT WAS AS LEVEL AS A KANSAS
PKAIKlE.
But what was the matter?
Not one acre in thirty with even a
show of improvement! Why had the
country not developed' 1 asked all
s-irts of questions, of all st.rts of peo
ple. Who owned this idle land?
Where die' they live? Etc., etc.
I obtained more Dulletins and soil
surveys and geological surveys and re
read some history. After a study ot
the data obtainable I accounted for
lack of development by the following
resaons :
First Inaccessibility. Until the
Tennessee Central railroad was built
over the plateau nothing could be
marketed advantageously that could
not transport itself.
Second Speculation. Upon a geo
logical survey of the state which lo
cated the mineral deposits, much ot
the land was boughl as a speculation
Ihe purennser, inmost cases, having
KCAwva..
later gotten several tiniei the first cost
of the land out of the timber sold, re -
tains the land for its coal 61 per cent

was indifferent to development of the
land tor agricultural yuryuw-.

and is an advantage to the resident
stock grower. But the western man,
who has not seen this "range" and who
classifies "range ' with desert or land
worthless tor agricultural purposes, is
driven away rather than invited by it.

Prof. Chas. A. Keffer of the Depart
ment of Extension of the University
of Tennessee, will be present and have
charge of the agricultural work. He
will probably bring one or two of his
assistants to speak on various lines of
the extension vork.
So many calls for speakers at the

nounce just who can be furnished by
that department any great time in ad
vance. Rev. James H. Miller, D D., of
Lebanon, who is the superintendent of
the Country Life work of the Presby
tery ot Cumberland mountain, will be
