Admiral-Mayo in Command of

WASHINGTON. Aug. 2J. Admiral

land invaders on tho Atlantic Hca
twi.r.i anJ ac Admiral, Helm's
"tlluo" defending squadrons had not
met In liaO.eTto-dayMh' the greatest
war game of the American Navv.
Bomewhere out In the Atlantic tho
scouts of both fleets were groping
for one ancther.
At daylight near Admiral Helm's
scouts were spread out over the arc
of a great 600-mlle circle, the centro
of which was a point due east of
Cape Hatteras, where tho Invaders
and the great armada of troop
transports wcro reported n- the start
of tho problem twenty-four hours be
fore. If Admiral Muvo hud continued ill
leclly westward toward tho roast,
his advance ships and the defending
destroyers should have been In touch
at dayllcht. The fact that no report
had come that tho Invading scouts
hnd been picked up was taken to In
dicate that AdmlMl .Muvo had
changed his course and was working
nut his own plan for evading the dc
fenders, and gettlne his transports
to land.

were reported to-day, but olllclals of
the Health Department still Insisted
tho epidemic wan on the wane.
Health Commissioner Emerson said
the Increases formed one of the, pe
culiar features of the epidemic. On
days when decreases were naturally
to be expected, he pointed out, unex
plalnabln Inrreuscs ivmtU lake place,
mid during other periods when In
creases were looked for there would
be decreases. The Commissioner said
the hot weather had nothing to do
with the Jump In new cases, but It
probably wan responsible for a pro
portion of the deaths.
One of tho chief topics discussed
to-day, both In tho otllces of the
Health Department nnd the head
quarters uf tho Government experts
who me hero lighting the epidemic,
was a icport tint Ur, Samuel G. Dlx
on. State Health Commissioner of
Pennsylvania, had proved by scien
tific methods that the house fly serves
as a "carrier" of the Infantile paraly.
sis germ.
Dr. Dixon collected house flics
from n dwelling In which u child had
died of the disease, and Used them In
making Inoculations In a monkey.
Within a short time the monkey de
veloped Infantile paralysis. f
"Dr. Dixon's experiment sounds
plausible," said Dr. Wndo II. Frost,
one of the Government bacteriolo
gists. "I want to know more about
his experiment, however, before dis
cussing It."
Heretofore It has been maintained
that the stablo fly, a species not com
mon to New York City, wus the only
Insect known to be capable of carry
ing the paralysis germ and Inoculat
ing human bolngs.

ROUMANIA HESITATES,

With the Russian and Italian troops added to the French, British,

arc battling with the armies of four other countries Germany, Austria,
Bulgaria and Turkey.
Uuhjarians have pushed luck both wins and It is only In the centrr,
In the Vardar valley, Hint the cntenle advances have been scored.
Berlin announces further progress in. driving back the Entente forces
at the western end of the Macedonian line and also the repulse of the
Serbs in the vicinity of Moglena.
On the western front, along the Somme, the British continue closing
in on Thiepval, on their left flank, and apparently have Guillemont on
tneir right, ahiMSt within their grip.
South of the Soiiune the French have been forced out of the trenches
they captured early in the week.
Petrograd admits that the Germans have resumed the offensive on
the Volhynian front, south of Urody. Vienna asserts that the Russians
have made no gains on the Volhynian, Gallci.ui or Carpathian fronts. The
loss of 5,000 Russians in three days in Galicia alone is reported.
