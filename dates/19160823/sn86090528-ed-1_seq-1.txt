SAVES U. S.
COTTON PLANTER
Great Britain by Placing $250,000,000
at Disposal of American Planters
Held Price Up to 8 1-2 Cents
Dy United Press.
London, August (By mail.)
That the British government decided
not to let American cotton to go be
low Sli cents a pound to planters;
that it. prepared to spend 2H0 million
to prevent a possible cotton panic in
America and that it sent agents to the
United States to buy cotton in unlimit
ed quantities to keep the price nor
mal; and also that these agents are
still in tho United States, aro facts
given to the United Press today.
The British government, when it de
cided in 1915 to make cotton contra
band realized that it might cause a
panic in the United States. Felix
Rose, who directed tbe British plan to
prevent this, told today bow he did it.
"We bad to declare cotton contra
hand!" said he, "but. we wanted to pro
tect the cotton planters. We knew
the speculators- would make capital of
the order in council and drive cotton
prices to ruinous depths.
"So the British government decided
to go into the market as a buyer. I
looked over tho market and decided
we should be ready to buy Z million
bales; and we had to have 2.10 million
dollars at our disposal constantly.
"We thought the planter should not
get less than S', cents, so we sent
agents to the United States with un
limited authority to buy. That was in
July of 1!M... We told the American
government of our plan. On August
18th the kir,g signed the order in coun
cil declaring cotton couueband.
"No panic, followed. What we bad
done was not generally known and
the strength of cotton in the open mar
ket must have been a mystery to the
speculators. In the first week cotton
went up a iTnt. Within a month it
was up C'i cents. So the planters re
ceived $t;o,timi,fnii more for the crop
tlat year than they would have re
ceived in normal times.'

that evey hale of cotton that has been
seized by the British has been paid

would have received an exorbitant
profit if he had gotten it to Germany
instead of its bring seized by the Brit

FIRE PLUGS
Another Phase of Traffic Regulations
Which Will Soon Be Taken Up by
MotorcyrJe Cop and Police Force
Two Western Union delivery boys
felt the heavy hand of ths law yester
day afternoon when they were jerked
up hy Sammy Dwyer for holding on to
motorcycles while mounted on their
bicycles In the delivery of telegrams.
This is a pastime enjoyed by ninny
boys on wheeln and the messengers
did not renlize that they had commit
ted an Infringement of tho traffic
laws while engaging In it. They learn
ed differently, however, and blended
guilty at. yesterday afternoon's ses
sion of tho polico court. This is a
dangerous practice, the officers ar.srrt,
aiul must be discontinued or other
boys will be treated in tho same man
ner. Mayor Coffman did not assess
fines against the boys yesterday hut
will give his decision in the eases to
day. The fact that Miss Martha ISledsoe
"jay drove" in order to stop at the
meat market of Councilman Neal, one
of the, men who gave Sammy bis Job,
was not considered when that lady
was politely informed that she had un
consciously committed a violation of
the law. She paid $.1.
Matt Chilton, who was arrested by
Dwyer for jsy driving at the corner
of Sixth and Choctaw, was fined $1
yesterday afternoon.
City Officer Warned.
The matter of hitching too near a
fire plug or a mail !;ck is receiving tho
attention of tho officers now and the
first-man to bo warn ;' was ' Wafer
Commissioner - Frank Scrims ger, w ho
made haste to remove his steed
required distance from the fire plug
near which he hud been accustomed to
slopping in front of his office nt thn
city hall.
Less Speeding Now.
A noticeable decrease in the nuiiiber
of speeders is reflected in the very
few speeding cases which have come
up before the court. Most of tho of
fenders thus far have violated por
tions of the ordinance with the provis.
ions of which they were not familiar,
and were, in a sense, innocent offend
ers. A glance at tho locations of the
arrests rhows that Officer Dwycr's
sphere of activity has no bounds with
in the city limits and the fact that he
cannot be distinguished from any oth
er motorcyclist afiyr dark makes oth
er riders of mot in' wheels comrade?
in a good cause, as no driver will take
a chance on speeding when the small
headlight of a two-wheeled machine
hoves in sight.
Autolsts Are Reconciled.
"When wo first began to make ar
rests for violations of the ordinance
some of tho people were disposed to
bawl us out," said Chief of Police Pen
Phillips this morning. "But no v it is a
different story.. The people are al
ready seeing the beneficial effect of
the work and are fi-Uiiig in line. I
heard one prominent man warning a
friend last night, and be was laughing
when he did it. 'Look out for Sammy'
he said. "He got me and he'll-Ket you.:
too. if he sees you.'
"The autoists themselves are betu
ning to like it. When the traffic rules
are fully enforced it will make it so
much better for everybody that they
will wonder whv it has not been done!
I
ueiore.
Chief Phillips dei lares that the cam
paigu against these violations will bf
kept, up until the abuses lire entirely '
discontinued.
The two Western Union messenger
boys were fined $J..1o each for hold
ing on to motorcycles, but later offend
ers are likely to be more harshly ib alt

Jack Taylor was arrested today for
