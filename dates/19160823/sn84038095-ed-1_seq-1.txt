At a meeting pf the city council on

papers. There was oniy one bid 6n
tered, that being of the M. L. Flinn
Construction coiripany, of Sioux City,
•whose bid was so reasonable that the
council awarded the contract.
The contract as let Is a little higher
than that for the pavement which is
now being put in, but it is generally
understood' that the contracors are
losing money on the present job. The
twelve blocks of paving were let for
$1.42^ per cubic yard, while that let
early tljis spring, was for $1.27%. an
increase of x* cents per cubic yard. The

Is as follows:
Concrete paying, per cu. yd., $1.42%.
Extra stone, per cu. yd., $2.00.
Extra sand, per cu. yd., $1.55,
Extra grading, per cu. yd., 40c.
i^xtra concrete, per cu. yd., $7.50.
Building new curb, per lineal foot, 38c.
Resetting curb, per lineal foot, 18c.
The new contract is made up of two
vN jobs, that on Court street and that on
Sweet -street. On Court street from
the Normandy hotel to the crossing at
the I. C. tracks, will cost $18,686.50.
Sweet street, from the Carnegie lfbrary
to the Northwestern freight depot, will
cost $16,207.75.
Mr. M. L: Flinn was present at the
meeting and signed up the contract
and stated to the council that he will
commence work on the new contract
September 1st, and expects to have a
large portion of the work done before
freezing weather sets in.
After the letting of the paving con
tract the council discussed the matter
of cleaning the streets and all of the
members were agreed that a street
liusher would be the most feasible
means of keeping the streets in good
condition. Mr. B. Brodersen, on the
part of. the business men, submitted
the proposition of paying., the cost of
