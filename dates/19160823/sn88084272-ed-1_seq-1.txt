Troops -Will Be Withdrawn.
Probably the first problem taken up
by the joint commission will be the
proposed withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico, as suggested by
Gen. Carranza in his original note pro
posing the commission. As Gen. Fun
ston has recommended the recall of
Gen. Pershing's expedition, this Is ex
pected to be agreed to by the American
members.
Gen. Carranza appointed his commis
sioners "preferably" to discuss this
question, the. negotiation of a protocol
covering the crossing of the interna
tional border in pursuit of bandits, and
investigation of the interests which
might have been behind the raids into
American territory. The United States
refused to limit the discussion to thes
subjects and others undoubtedly will
UC &UI1C iniu.
It has been suggested that out of the
discussion of economic conditions in
Mexico might come assurances that
would make it possible for American
financial and commercial interests to !
oner aid in the rehabilitation of the
republic.
Militia to Be Recalled.
It is regarded as probable here thai
withdrawal of the Pershing expedition
would be followed soon by the recall of
the national guard from the border.
Some high officials of the army believe
that with Pershing's men added to the
border patrol and the additional men
provided under the new armv bill. Gen.
Funston would have a sufficient force
of regulars to adequately protect the
border.

SAXTA FE, N'. M.. Aug. 23. They're
off at Santa Fe. Conferences and
meetings that continued Into the
small hours of last night were produc
tive of a trace of the harmony that Is
held to be essential to Republican
success in the campaign which is to
follow this convention.
With full delegations in attendance,
it is the biggest and most important
convention yet held by New Mexico.
Thee has been no lessening of the
tension in the struggle of candidates
for nomination, but the contest over
the organization, predicted by many,
did not develop in the meeting of the
state central committee, which vjl3
held at 10 oclock this morning.
Fight Made On Ely.
Last night plans were under consid
eration whereby the committee was to
deprive Ralph a Ely. chairman, of the
privilege of calling the convention to
order. The reason for this was that
for months Ely from the platform and
through the press, has been denounc
ing the organization which he heads.
There was no move this mnrninir to
strip him of power, for the reason he I
nf nas rpomised to do nothing radical
or drastic when he called the conven
tion to order and before he turned it
over to temporary organization.

Aug. 22. (Via London. Aug. 23.) On
a 1000 yard front at Thiepval ridge
both the German line and the support
trench were taken Monday by the Brit
ish. One pair of eyes could not see
more detail than the correspondent
saw. It was the very finesse of war.
With the clear air of a bright after
noon sun over his shoulder, one looked
across the tiny valley toward a slope.
There the bare ground was cut with
the slash of a new British trench and
beyond that, across an area of dead
grass and wavy maize, was the old

A Magara rush of whishing screams
from capsules of concentrated hell tore
through the air and began bursting
over it. Their flashes hugged it in an
internal ecstacy. sweeping it with
myriads of bullets and fragments,
shooting forked tongues of death into
its burrows. To show a head and es
cape being hit and hit more than once
was as hopeless as to stand up in a
thick hailstorm without being hit bv
