Fierce Fighting But No
Change In West
London, Aug. 23. A great battle of
nations with the troops of nearly every
European belligerent involved, is grad
ually developing in the Balkans as the
fighting along the 150 mile front in
creases in fury.
Turkey is sending reinforcements in
to Bulgaria, according to an Athens
dispatch today. At least one division
of Turkish soldiers is en route to join
the Bulgars in the attack on the allied
lines, while another division will be -so
placed as to threaten Rumania should
that country decide to enter the war
on the side of the allies.
Austria will be asked to send a 'few
detachments to tho Greek border to
join the Bulgars, Germans and Turks in
resisting the combined attacks of
French, English, Russians, Italians, Ser
bians and Montenegrins. In no en
gagement of modern history have the
armies of so many nations been in clash
along one battle front.
Forced to yield advanced Dositions
under the first Bulgarian attack, the al
lies have reinforced their lines and are
strongly on the offensive in the Varda
valley, northwest of Salonika. On the
wings, the Bulgars have made further
alight advances by reason of their num
erical superiority but Anglo-French ar
tillery and the stubborn resistance of
the herbs has considerably checked the
monjentum of the advancing enemy
forces.'

But despite war like reports brought

situation do not believe that Rumania
will enter the war at least uutil the
allies have advanced tip the Vardar val
ley and have scored decisive gains
against the Bulgarians. It has been

Third Rumanian army was mobilized

By Robert J. Bender.

Washington, Aug. 23. The three cor

nation-wide railroad strike appeared
this afternoon to have run into a jam.
Leaders among the railroad presi
dents said they could not see how any
conclusions could be reached in less
than 48 hours. At the same time, in
unother part of tho city, leaders of the
railroad brotherhood representatives
were planning ways of holding in check

holding out against acceptance of the

Some even are talking among them

These, however, include few of the

German Official Tells of
Means Used to Influence
Rumanian Officials
Berlin, Aug. 23. Beautiful women
and huge suras of money are being used
by the allies in the great diplomatic
battle being waged at Bucharest, the
allies seeking to bring Rumania into
the war. I
A distinguishes German diplomat,
whose name was, not revealed, made
this charge throned the nemi-officinl
German news agency today. But
despite the allies)' effortB. Rumania is
yet undecided, he said, adding:
ttumania hasbeen the aphynx and
is still now shrouded with a mysterious
veil behind which the political passion
and agitations, not only of the Ruman
ians, but of the allied agents, are at
the highest pitchi"
"The allies' agitation reached its
height at the beginning of the last
Russian offensive," said the diplomat.
" At the same time the allies announced
a Balkan offensive by General Sarrail,
which was undertaken purely for
political purposes. The central powers,
in their official 'reports, stiematized
Sarrail 's operations as "feigned." Now
a sudden Bulgari&Vi. offensive had put a
quick end to the allies' activities. The
Russian offensive is apparently Black
ening.
''At present Rumania is still unde
cided: She probably will not give up
her well calculated, clever neutrality
wnicn nas prougnt ner an enormous
gain in power, unless she thinks that a
really decisive turn has been reached
in the war. Meanwhile trade relations
between Rumania and the central
powers continue small."

Assertion

FOR HIS BEING DEFEATED
Intimation That Federation Is
Partisan Is Resented Its
Name Changed
New York, Aug. 23. Because of the
heat, an effort was being made today
to wind up the business of the fifteenth
annual convention of the National Fed
eration of Catholic Societies by tonight
instead of holding sessions Thursday as
originally planned.
A -clash between Colonel Patrick Hen
ry Callahan, of -Louisville, Ky., chair
man of the religious prejudice commit
tee of the Knights of Columbus, and
Joseph Brennan, of Boston, occurred
during the morning session.
Callahan had praised the non-Catholics
of the country for their tolerance.
After the chair had refused Brennan
permission to reply and he gained the
floor by voto of the federation, he
characterized Callahan's remarks as
"silly," "ridiculous" and as "spread
ing soft soap."
"It is the height of ridiculousness to
describe the road as smooth, when it is
rough,' he snid. "It is nonsense to
talk ornoti-Catholics allowing Catholics
to do this or that. Catholics are Amer
ican citizens and have the same rights
as others." . .- - . . ...
"One purpose of this convention."
Callahan said, "is to., disillusion th
minds of non-Catholics of the belief
that Catholics look only through the
eyes of the capitalists. It is very evi
dent that there is no Catholic unanim
ity. I picked up a newspaper today
which showed that Catholics voted three
different ways on the Mexican ques
tion." Joseph Brennan. of Boston, who made
the attack upon Colonel Callahan, was
tne oniy omcer who failed of re-elec
tion. The rest of the board of officers,
headed by John Whalen, of New York,
as president, were re-elected. Members
of the nominating committee claimed
failure to re-elect Brennan had nothinir
to do with his speech on the floor of the
convention this morning but it was sim
ply he was no longer an officer of the
organization in Boston and therefore
not entitled to reelection as a vice-
president.
lhe convention voted to chance the
name of the organization to the Catho
lic Federation of the United Statos and
to organize under the Boston plan, with
the diocese as the unit or organization
rather than the state or county. This
plan will first be submitted to the bish
ops of the United States for their ap
proval. VigoroiiB resentment over the intimn.
tions that the federntio n is rmrtisfiii dsi

words of Bishop Hickcy, of Rochester,
were repeated frequently today by the
delegates.

to unite and cast their influences at the
polls "where it will subservo' tho high

tho Gonzaga Union, of St. Louis, who
made the appeal, declared thero were at

number places in our hands a power to
be used in works of social, civic better
ment, in works of mercy and of pence.
When the Catholic arm is uplifted let it
be for construction always, but never
for destruction."
Mr. Zipf asserted he was not n.
tending for a religious pnrty, but for

Into public life a spirit of liberty and

he declared, "and under suchMeader

no far shall thou go and no further."
Resolutions calling upon the United
States government to force the de facto
government of Mexico to guarantee re
ligious liberty and protect Americans
were passed by the German Roman
Catholic church Vcrein this afternoon.
The resolutions were telegraphed to
Secretary of State Lansing. The resolu

New York, Aug. 23. The de-'

meeting at Salt Lake City,..
Utah, has been so great that the
local committee abandoned their,
plans to have Hughes speak in
a hall and have engaged the big
Mormon tabernacle, Republican -National
Chairman Willcox said,
this afternoon.
Candidate Reaches Reno.
Reno, Nov., Aug. 23. Charles Evans
Hughes campaigned today in the first
democratic Btate he has encountered
since ho left Bridgehampton. N. Y,
three weeks ago to begin his long;
"swing around the circle,"' He started
his invasion with an assault on the dem
ocratic tariff and foreign policies hese
today, adding also a defense of his own
labor record. Big crowd of Nevadiaosj
greeted the republican presidential nom- -inee
everywhere. ,
.. Today, however, Hughes' started an
active rebellion. NeVer agaia will ha
permit" local or Btate committees to put
him through such a course of strenuoa
ity in campaigning as that which he un
derwent yesterday. The republican can
didate admitted that he is very nearly
tired out. Those with whom he, talked
before his train reached here said he .
told them that the spirit was willing bat
that no human being could stand .many
more days of the sort he has been un
dergoing during. the past week. The
gladdest man in the United States will
be Charles Evans Hughes when August
27 rolls around and he and Mrs. Hughes
can settle down for three days rest at
Kstes Park, Colo. ' There the governor
expects to sleep and eat and get out
in the air all he can. , v
His weariness was plainly discernible
today in a husky voice that did queer
tricks of inflection when he sought to
press it to renewed effort but, never
theless, he had an indomitable enthus
iasm that revived him when he faced an
audience.
Is About Worn Out
Two or threo times, duriug the past
few days Hughes hasn't been able, be
cause of pressure of demands made upon
him by local and state arrangements
committees, to get his dinner before late
Bt night. He was scheduled yesterday .
to make 14 speeches, but at least eight
were added at the lust moment. The
nominee has ruled that he will not dis
uppoint a crowd when they besiege hie
private car and this very willingness
led the local committees to impose on
him.
Hughes apparently tulks with great
fucility but it is a facility which he
has acquired only throuuh a lono- nerio.l
of concentration and preparation. Col
onel Roosevelt, whose trans-continental
trip of four yeors ago is really sur
passed in strenuosity by Hughes', has s
raciilty for quick concentration and lit
tle preparation, but Hughes' service ou
the bench ami the painstaking legal
mind with which ho is eauirmcd. forca
him to study long anil arduously in map
ping out ull of hia talks even the small
est ones.
His present trin. therefore. In even
harder on the candidate than his sched
ule indicates, because so little time is
granted him for preparation.
tiovernor Hughes addressed 4.000 ner-
sniis in Hncrnmciito last night at a meet
ing which was declared by the repub
lican state loaders to be non partisan.
i-nunr legislation aim a federal work
man 's compensation law were discucced
nt considerable length by him. Ho de
clared strongly for preparedness and at-
tncKeu tne administration s course in
Mexico.
Reverting to his labor record, he read
an extract from an editorial that ap-
l'(.-ri-ti in me --rgan or urganixea La

which he was referred to as "the great
