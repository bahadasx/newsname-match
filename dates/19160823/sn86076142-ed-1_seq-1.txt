STRONG MINORITY" Of' BROTHERHOODS TIKIE OF DELAY
Leaders Are Alarmed and
Fear Cannot Hold Men
Without Quick Action
I Br Imrtalti Preaa.)
WASHINGTON, August 23. Hail
road Employes' committee showed
such marked unrest since the delay
In negotiations between the president
and railway executives that the lead
ers of the men are alarmed and
openly express fears of their ability
to hold them in check much longer.
The employes" meeting this afternoon
was thrown Into an uproar by
speeches from the minority demand
ing Immediate action unless the roads
accept the president's plan.
The leaders succeeded In adjourn
ing before radical action was taken.
Many member of the unions are
strongly in favor of) an immediate
strike, but they were not able to get
a vote at today's meeting.
The leaders said that while the
pressure of the minority is strong
they believed tbe majority will give
the president more time. The men
gave free expression to their opinions.
They felt the railroads showed a dis
position to disregard the sacrifice of
the demand for time and one half
for overtime. Some urged that the
delegate return home, leaving au
thoiity with the leaders to call a
strike in event the rail executives
do not accept the plan.
While the rail executives continued
their deliberations the president con
ferred with Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson regarding a
bill to increa.se the membership of
the Interstate Commerce committee
by two. Newlands announced he
would push the bill.
The possibility of passing an eight
hour law was discussed, but no defi
nlte program was evolved. It was
understood that no action will be
taken unless the president's efforts to
effect a settlement fail.
The creation of a permanent com
mission to Investigate such contro
versies was one of the subjects men
tioned In the conference. Otherwise
no legislation to meet the situation
was discussed.
It is definitely understood the rail
road executives have decided to act
as a unit in handling the present
situation. Their, program, it was
learned, is first to deal with the prin
ciple of arbitration and afterward the
eight hour day. 1
WAITING FOR GREECE
AND RUMANIA TO
ACT
There are indications that the ruil
road presidents are willing to con
cede the eight hour day on condition
that there Is definite assurance given
that future disputes will be arbi
trated. Eight presidents of Important rail
way systems who have been desig
nated to draft the railroads' reply to
President "Wilson's appeal that they
accept his plan for averting a nation
wide strike, were in almost continu
ous session yesterday and last night
without solving their problem.
Although some of the sixty or mm
presidents are showing a disposition
to prolong the negotiations in thei
hope, that the sentiment of business!
men of the country will be shown to
be opposed to the Idea of an eight
hour day, there was a general feeling
that a definite answer to President
Wilson's demand camioi be much
longer postponed. The president Is
understood to have indicated that he
desired his proposals to be fully de
bated by the executives, but their
conferences among themselves have

the Carpathian regions the Russians
have been unable to make gains of
ground from the Teutonic forces.
The Russian losses in fighting
along the Stokhod, northeast of Kovel
particularly, are heavy.
A correspondent of the Cologne

that in the fighting near Horodenka,
East Galicia, early in August, the
Russians lost 5000 killed, while the
total German losses were 80. The

quantities of ammunition, In addition
to suffering heavy losses, final ex
