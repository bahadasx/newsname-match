TURNER THEATRE
ARRANGES SEASON
SERIES OF TRAVELOG PICTURES
WILL BE GIVEN EVERY
MONTH
COMEDY AND DRAMA BOTH
REPRESENTED IN EARLY
BOOKINGS
.Aside irom the novelty, humor and
Requisite beauty that alw ays characterize
•HLyman H. Howe's Travel Festival which
comes to the Turner Theatre on Tuesday,
August 29th, the new production may
well be said to be an intellectual treat
such as may be derived only by roaming
over the world—"For to admire and for
to see." One of the features will
familiarize Americans with far-off Ha
waii—a subject of most timely interest
considering that native Hawaiians are
rapidly becoming extinct. Today there
are not more than 26,000 natives of pure
blood. In this portion there is a supreme
spectacle offered by old Mother Earth—
a lake of living fire and boiling lava in
the crater of the Hawaiian volcano of
Kilauea.
The United States is also represented
on the program by a very recently photo
graphed series depicting the West Point
Military Academy and various activities
by the Cadets, ranging from imposing
•^sf dress parades to tactics of the most
Strenuous and thrilling nature known in
the curriculum of this famous institution.
The film provides a military flavor with
out imparting any of the unpleasantness
of actual warfare and gives a compre
hensive idea of the training undergone
by our young men who aspire to careers
as officers in the army.
Sunny Spain contributes a series of
scenes par excellence. It comprises a
visit to Seville with its beautiful Giralda
tower built by the Moors, which is a
splendid example of their art and by-City
~^^S9ne power Here a veritable fairyland
of Moorish architecture ivrevealed—a
wonderland of marble and court
yards, which inspires ries of the
arrang.
most romantic pages ash history.
The series is enlivened by the presence
of many quaint Spanish types ranging
in age from babyhood to old age and
charming Senontas performing the grace
ful Aragonese dance "La Jota."
Then comes another feature of sur-purpose
n?tssing interest—Norw ay, with its ocean
^venues for fords surrounded on all
sides by towering mountains and in-standing
cluding a memorable view of the Mid
night Sun, and the impressive sight of
thousands of reindeer swimming across
one of the fjords.
Our feathered friends—the birds—are
also shown in all the gorgeous raiment
with which nature has endowed them,
also numerous fishes, and a most ab
sorbing subject of catching sharks.
The new program contains many
other features including entirely new
comedy cartoons which freely inter
sperse the more sedate subjects and
enliven the performance with much
wholesome humor and laughter.
Commencing some time the forepart
of September and showing once or twice
a month throughout the season the
I Turner Theatre will show a series of
I Travelog and Educational Moving
Pictures. These reels will cover practi
cally every point of interest in the United
States and Canada and will be entirely
complete and very interesting from the
I first show to the end of the season. All
school children will be admitted free to
all of this series when accompanied by
I their parents. This gives one indeed a
chance to "See America First" at very
I little expense.
"Lazy Bill," one of W. B. Patton's
I attractions will probably be next at the
Turner Theatre and is a comdey worth
while going to. The W. B. Patton shows
have never yet failed to please their
audience.
"In Old Kentucky" with its jockey
heroine, its piccaninny brass band, its
*. double quartette and its spectacular and
fhrilling scenes will come here in the early
part of the season.
Gaskell & McVitty will present "Grau
stark" one of the strongest dramas ever
written. The American, who wins his
lady love and a kingdom at the same
time fills the audience with admiration.
"Twin Beds" a high class musical
comedy will make its appearance some
time in October. This company carries
a car load of scenery and furnishes
laughter and music unlimited but it'shouse,
$ good and clean.
"What Happened to Charlie" deals
4 /, with the world renowned Charlie Chaplin.
If you like Charlie in movies you will
like this play better.
The Aborn Opera Co. will present
"The Bohemian Girl" the early part
of November. This production is one
of the finest that has been at the Turner
Theatre tor some time. The manager
went to considerable trouble and the
company had to be given special induce
ments even to come to so small a place
as New UlmT
"Alaska" dealing with a woman in a
man's country, a gripping story from
start to finish, will show here in Decem
ber.
Several other good attractions are
being booked and amongst them will be
Lyman Howe once more. The ap
proaching season promises to be a good
one for the theatrical business in New
Ulm and all drama and music lovers will
be glad to know this.
WALLACHEI AGAIN
SCENE OF BATTLE
NATIVE SONS OF THE SOUTH
SIDE SUBURB INDULGE IN
RUCTION
CLUB HOUSE BRAWL SHOULD
RESULT IN CLOSING THIS
DANCE HALL
"Wallachei" was the scene of another
pitched battle which was pulled off
shortly after 12 o'clock Saturday night
and members of the Kraus family as
usual played the leading roles in the mix
up. As a result of this engagement,
George Kraus carries his left arm in a
sling, having enjoyed a complete
fracture of the radius and his head in
bandages on account of cuts and bruises,
the result of blows from various instru
ments. Joseph Kraus, a brother, and
the assailant, is under arrest and had his
preliminary hearing yesterday before
Justice N. Henningsen.
There was a dance at the South Side
Club House Saturday evening which
George Kraus attended as a guest of
George Keckeisen, arriving at the dance
hall about 8:30. According to his story
Joseph Kraus, the assailant, did notparents
reach the dance hall until nearly mid
night. George was then in the so-called
bar room. As soon as Joseph saw his
brother he addressed some uncompli
mentary remarks to him for the sole
of irritating and angering him.
George stepped into the dance hall to
avoid any ruction and after he had been
there only a very short time
talking to William Terhofter, he
wasseem
attacked by Joseph just as he had told
Terhofter that he was going to dance.
According to George's story, he said
nothing and Joseph said nothing, but the
latter attacked him with a beer glass
striking him on the forehead with such
force that the beer glass broke. This
George remembers but after that every
thing was a blank to him until he came
to the open air outside.
It would seem from other witnesses
that Joseph then used a pop bottle as a
weapon and struck George on the head
several tunes. At any rate George
carries the marks of three blows. The
victim of the assault lost considerable
blood and was quite weak when he
reached the Doctor's office after stopping
at police* headquarters first to report the
assault. He will be laid up with his arm
for at least six weeks. Besides that his
injuries are quite painful.
In the meantime the assailant had
telephoned police headquarters for pro
tection, intimating that he was fearing
for his life. The night police made in
vestigations and called up Chief Herzog.
From the facts as they were laid before
him, he concluded that the only thing
that he could do under the circumstances
was to arrest Joseph and put him in jail
which he did. At two different times
Joseph made the statement in the hearing
of Chief Herzog and others that if he
had had a gun he would have killed
George.
Joseph was admitted to bail in the sum
of $500 Monday afternoon and the hear
ing was held before City Justice N
Henningsen yesterday morning at 10
o'clock and was concluded late in the
afternoon. After hearing all the testi
mony the Justice bound the defendant
over to the December term of the District
Court to await the action of the grand
jury.
Ever since it became known that there
was some trouble in the Wallachei club
citizens generally and those
living near there especially, have given
free vent to their opinion that the place
should be closed up and the matter will
no doubt be called to the Mayor's at
tention.
LITTLE GIRL SHOT
BY HER BROTHER
YOUNG CHILDREN OF EDGAR
VEECK FIGURE IN TERRIBLE
TRAGEDY.
BOY OF FIVE ACCIDENTALLY
CAUSES DEATH OF HIS
SISTER.
One of those unexplainable combi
nations of circumstances which produce
results which are impossible to forecast
occurred Monday and resulted in the
accidental shooting of little Vivian
Veeck, three year old daughter, of Mr.
and Mrs. Edgar Veeck, followed by her
instant death. The gun was in the
hands of her five year, old brother Charles
but just how the accident happened is
impossible to say as the children were
alone in a room upstairs.
The dreadful occurrence took place
just before the noon whistles blew. Mrs.
Veeck had gone with her father, Mr.
Credicott, to the Eagle Mills to get Mr.
Veeck for the noon meal, leaving her
mother in charge of the children. There
was no one else in the house at the time
except the maid who was busy preparing
dinner.
Mrs. Credicott was playing with the
little girl donwstairs and Charles on
adventure bent had gone upstairs to
explore. In a little while Vivian who
was the baby, wanted to play with her
brother and Mrs. Credicott let her goway.
upstairs, never dreaming of any danger.
The child had barely disappeared from
sight into one of the bedrooms when
there was the sound of a shot and the
grandmother and maid rushed upstairs
to be met by the sight of the little girl
quite dead with dreadful wounds all over
the back of the head and the scalp. The
face was not disfigured so the child must
have been turned away from her brother
when he pulled the trigger and re-the
leased the fatal charge.
Medical aid -was summoned but tiw
child was past all help, the doctor stating
that death had been instantaneous, with
no fright or pain for the child. The
arrived at home from the Mill
just a moment after the shot was fired
and both were prostrated by the terrible
blow.
The weapon which figured in the
accident was a shot gun and had recently
been cleaned and set away in the back of
a closet by Mr. Veeck. He had intended
to leave it unloaded and was positive that
he had done so, but the accident would
to show that he was mistaken,
having probably reloaded it mechanically
without realizing that he had done so.
Mr. Veeck is a nephew of J. H. Siegel
and Mrs. Veeck was Miss Cecil Credicott
of Mapleton before her marriage. Mr.
Veeck was employed at the Eagle Mills
some years ago but went to Mankato to
take a position with a Milling Co. and
during his stay there he was married'to
Miss Credicott. They made their home
in Mankato for a few years and both
children were born there. Two years
ago the family moved to New Ulm and
Mr. Veeck entered upon his work as
assistant to Mr. Siegel at the Eagle Mills.
The young father and mother have many
warm, close friends in the city who feel
with them deeply the great sorrow that
they are given to bear and the heart of
every father and mother in the communi
ty goes out to them with a particular
understanding and sympathy. Little
Charles and Vivian were both very
bright, attractive children and it seems
almost impossible to realize that so
awful a thing could happen all in a
moment.
The funeral will be held from the home
this afternoon and Rev. Hohn will
officiate in the absence of Rev. Wheeler
who is away on his summer leave of
absence. Interment will be made in the
City Cemetery.
ARBEITERVERE1N PICNIC
Preparations are afoot for the Labor
Day Picnic always held by the Arbeiter
verein of this city. As usual, Her
mann's Park is chosen for the picnic and
a program of bowling and other amuse
ments has been arranged. Refresh
ments of one sort and another will be
provided at the park. Labor Day falls
on the 4th of September this year.
SUCCEEDS BERNDT
A successor to the late Jul. Berndt as
superintendent of Hermann's Park has
been appointed in the person of Gott
lieb Dittmann. Mr. Dittmann will
receive a salary of $25. per month.
NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, AUG. 23, 1916.
CONTRACTORS ARE
BUSIER THAN EYER
NO INDICATKNS OF WAR TIME
EVIDENT IN BUILDING
INDUSTRY
MANY NEW HOMES GOING UPcho3e
HIGH PRICE OF MATERIAL
NO BAR
Who said lumber and other building
materials had advanced 40 percent
and more? No one would ever know it
to take a look over the city and see the
number of new building that are in pro
cess of construction. Even this early
in the year there are as many houses go
ing up as were built last year and always
there are a number more which are
started late in the summer so that the
owners can get them just far enough
along that the inside work can be com
pleted during the cold weather.
Not so many business blocks and
changes alorg Minnesota Street perhaps,
but the buildings that are going up are
good ones wl.lch wnl greatly improve
the appearance of the business section
of the city. There is the Weiser Block,
the Bastian .store buildings, the expansion
of the Forster Furniture Store and the
contemplated addition to the Vogel
building, all in one block.
One entirely new sort of building,
that is, new to New Ulm, is the apart
ment building going up on South Broad-
The New Ulm Investment Com-
pany is putting up this building and it
represents the growth of population in
New Ulm by indicating a demand for
renting properties which has not hereto
fore existed because nearly all citizens
of the place were formerly property
owners. Now there area great many
people who come here to make their
homes temporarily because of business
connections 'which are extending with
growth of the city and its industries.
Municipal improvements include the
buiWing .at the Cemetery which is in-teaching
tended to be used as a sort of chapel
during inclement weather so that mourn
ers need not face the dangers of ex
posure in wet and cold. The other
city building to be completed this
season is the shed for municipal machin
ery to be built near the city plant.
Another quasi-public building is thewill
new Rural Telephone Exchange struc
ture on German Street and Second
North. This will be one of the really
notable improvements of the year in
the city.
Among the homes that are soon to
be ready for their owners may be men
tioned the following:
Jake Vedder, N. Washington St.
Alfred Rein, N. Washington St.
P. C. Schueller, N. Washington St
Jacob Hauer, N. Minnesota St.
Hubert Berg, S. Broadway.
Chas. Tamsching, N. Broadway.

AVERTS CRASH BY
CAR
DITCHING
What might have been a very serious
accident was averted by quick thinking
when a party of West Newton and St.
George people were on their way to
Sleepy Eye Tuesday of last week. The
party consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Jos.ceive
Klingler, Jr., and-theif son Andrew
who was driving the car, and the Misses
Mary and Emma Pelant. The near
collision was caused by a car being stalled
on a bit of road too narrow to pass on
at the foot of a hill. The stalled car
belonged to a Le Sueur Center party
who killed the engine in attempting to
make the hill and had not got started
again when the Klingler car appeared,
coming at a rate that prevented stopping
in time. The driver of the approaching
car saw they must run into the ditch
or smash into the stalled car and he
the former as being least dangerous.
All the occupants of the Klingler car
were thrown out and Mrs. Klingler's
right hip was fractured. The other
members of the party escaped with little
or no injuries and the Klingler car was
not badly damaged.
SCHOOLS TO OPEN
MONDAY AUG. 28th
TEACHING FORCE FINALLY ALL
LINED UP.—MANY NEW
INSTRUCTORS
BIG ENROLLMENT EXPECTED.
NEW SUBJECTS OFFERED
STUDENTS
School bells will soon be ringing and
the passing of schoolchildren will again
be an accustomed sight to the residents
living near the schools. The fall term
of school commences next Monday,
August 28, and the superintendent and
school board are looking forward to a re
cord breaking enrollment. Last year's
enrollment showed an increase of several
per cent over that of the previous year,
the total coming close to 800 pupils in
the first day of school.
For the past few weeks men have been
busy fixing up the school buildings and
every room has an inviting look to all
but the prospective scholar. With the
addition of several new members to the
force of the schools, New Ulm
ought to come near the top of the list
of the cities in regard to educational
facilities. The commercial course was
found to be very acceptable and it is
expected that several out-of-town
scholars will attend the local school for
the purpose of taking this course, which
be extended this year.
Several of the boys who are to graduate
this year are at present with the militia
at the Mexican border. It is possible
that they will be allowed to come home
to continue their studies and if so a
special class will be arranged so that they
will be able to graduate, should they not
be present at the opening of the term.
Three other boys, Max Burg, Ben.
Sturm and Frank Hofmeister are also
with the militia. The three Seniors are
Wenzel Krai, Ernest Schleuder and John
Scheiderich.

NUMBER
GULF STORM RAGES
OYER BORDER CAMP
SOLDIERS AT LLANO GRANDE.
CAUGHT IN TEXAS HURRI
CANE ON HIKE.
TENTS BLOWN DOWN MEN" SLEEP*
IN BOX CARS.— CAMP
FLOODED
This week's letter from the boys at
Llano Grande did not reach New Ulm in
lime to be published and while no word7
has arrived from the Review correspond
ent, it is presumed from the Twin City
news reports that the delay was caused
by the heavy storm that swept over the
camp Friday, beginning while the boys
were out on their regular weekly hike.
The Review correspondent was in the
habit of mailing his letter Friday and it
is quite possible that he had not done so
before leaving on the hike and when he
returned the camp was in such shape
that there were more important things to
attend to for it is said the storm was
terrific and the men were drenched to the
skin when they got from their march.
While the gale blew down a number
of the tents and drove the rain thru them
in gusts, no one was injured and Saturday
the sick list was no larger than usual,
showing that the storm had not affected
the health' of the men to any extent.
Several of the companies were obliged
to move their tents later because they
were flooded and they found higher
ground. During the storm the men
were obliged to hold theii tents from being
blown away. A motion picture theatre
located near the Llano Grande camp
was destroyed by the storm which
reached the proportions of a hurricane.
A number of the soldiers of the Minne
sota and North Dakota regiments were
obliged to seek shelter for the night in
box cars and some took refuge in the
schoolhouse at Mercedes.
Roads to the Rio Grande became un
payable and the meri who had been
ordered to the river outposts were not
able to leave until Monday. They had
expected to go last week and the re
cruiting details who were ordered to
return home to their respective states
to secure more men to bring the com
panies up to war strength could not
leave camp because the Gulf Coast rail
way was washed away. There were a
number of others who had also beer*,
given home leave on account of dependent
families could not start.
Another effect the storm had was to
delay the paying of the troops. The
paymaster began the work of paying the
men Friday but was prevented from con
tinuing when the storm arrived. This is
the first money the men have received
and covers the month of June. Any
other big business that attempted to
stand its men off for such a length of
time would have quite a job on its hands
and there must be some dreadful slow
pokes in the department that has charge
of the payroll.
In New Ulm, as elsewhere, there are
^families who are suffering for the necessi
ties of life and the men at the Border are
worried by the thought of their depend
ents at home, without sufficient to
provide for their needs. There are
plans afoot here to take care of the needy
ones but the Government that really
knows where it is at would, have had all
these problems of simple arithmetic
worked out before there was need for
results.
In the absence of the news letter from
the Review correspondent, a letter
written last week to the Martin County
Sentinel will be of interest here since the
men all belong to the Second. Herewith
follow such portions of it as might apply
equally to the conditions that affect New
Ulm men:
We are still "dead broke". The ghost
hasn't walked. If a nickel would buy
a lunch for a mosquito, there isn't one of
us that could buy the first installment.
It is harder on the fellow who smokes*
because mooching is getting harder every
day. It is a rare sight to see a full
package of tobacco. Postage stamps,
writing paper and envelopes are also
getting scarce.
Several boxes of candy have been re
ceived from home this week and they
surely were appreciated. We dont have
very much sweets and a little candy is
greatly appreciated. (This isn't a hint
for any more, but just a note of apprecia-
