BEAUTIFUL WOMEM USED TO WIN RUMANIA'S AID
DEATH REVEALS
FACT MAN HAD
TRIO OF WIVES
Desire for Children Led At
torney to Establish Three
Homes
A RESPECTED CITIZEN
BY BETTY GRAEME
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.—Waa
the craving for children to bear
hie name, to carry on hie line,
to Inherit hia wealth, the irre
sistible force that drove Wil
liam Wallace Snyder, respected
O'tiien of New Jersey, to build
and maintain three homee?
Two of the three women wid
owed by Snyder's death have
gone into the courts to smirch
his memory In a quarrel over
hia real estate. They have bared
a etrange romance.
In IST* Snyder, a lawyer, married
Phoebe Baldwin, and they made
their home in Ea*t Orange, N. J.,
where Mr* Snyder, gray haired and
placid, aurvlves him. Vndlsturbed
by the storlea of the other wives,
the refuses to be mixed up In their
contest
Reatdes her home and her own In
dependent mean*. Snyder willed hi*
fir t partner |."0 a week.
After 11 years the yoke of matri
mony that failed to brtag the cioeer
tie of parenthood became too heavy
to be borne. The tweet, placid wife
shared in his disappointment also
Remember* Fleet Wife
To divorce her would be cruel and
unfair. A quiet, reeerved man. Sny-
M»r had no wish to hurt the wife
pWho had been his true and loyal
,companion.
I to he eatabliahed another
home. He took another wife,
ao far removed In the social
acale from the first that they
would never meet.
To Mrs. I.nrlnda Pabst Snyder,
whom he met In Trenton, and to
whom he gave his name. William
Wallace Snyder waa a eapenter. She
helped htm build the little home at
318 9ev«nU - St.. Harrison. N. J..
which the tl ' Mra Snyder Is now
trying to *r from her
Quarrtta With No. 2
But again a great disappointment
•waited him. The wish of hi* heart
was denied.
He grew restless: he stayed away
long. Once Luclnda accuaed him
of caring for acme one else, and he
flew Into a rage. Once she found
him In New York with another
woman and forced him to accom
pany her home.
These things did not endear the
•llent. dignified man to her, and
when his will was read. HER
NAME WAS NOT MENTIONED.
In 1898 Snyder married, at Buf-
Jo. Sara D. Whlteneck.
f Beside the Income to his first
love. Snyder willed to "Sara D
Whlteneck, daughter of Alfred
Whlteneck. of Pleasant Valley. Mer
cer county, N. J., $f>d a week during
her natural life, if she ahall ao long
remain single and unmarried."
Sentiment Governs Him
It alao dlrecta that any Income
above the 1100 be uaed to educate
his children. Helen, born at Irving
ton In 1899, and William Wallace,
bom at Mount Vernon In 1901, and
at the expiration of the trust for the
two women, the eatate shall be di
vided between the*e children. The
first and laat Mrs Snyder are made
executors.
To the end. deep sentiment gov
erned Snyder's life —a de*lre to
make reparation to the first woman
he had wronged, and to have her
share equally with the woman who
had given him the crowning Joy of
life —his children.
Wh»n the bat tin ha* been fought
out In the New Jersey court* these
children, for whom William Wallace
Snyder dared everything, with the
memory of a loving;. Indulgent
father, treasured In their heart*
will be alone In their reapect for
Hi memory.

INSPECTOR SAVES GIRL
FROM POLICE "TRAP;"
HELPS HER REGAIN
HEALTHY BEAUTY
T \\ AN I to tell one mure story that Inspector
A "Mike Powers told me. Then I want to resign
from the police beat. I want to return it to the
gentleman to whom it rightfully belong*. Aside
from some murders and undiscovered bomb plots
the thing is in perfectly good condition.
I his, like the one Inspector "Mike" told me about
"Lillian." is the story of a girl.
She was down and out. She had no home,
she had no money and she had no job. All she had
was a pair of lungs that didn't work any more, and a
doctors assurance that with proper care and nourish
ment she might live three months.
1 he night he told her that, she dragged herself
wearily along Second ave. It didn't matter to her,
much, where she went. It took her constant atten
tion to keep up the painful process of breathing.
RUNS INTO POLICE FRAME UP
A man touched her arm and «|»oke to her She
looked at him dully.
-What did you say?" she asked
The man turned and whistled nhrilly. A policeman on the
corner rushed toward them.
"She accosted me." eh* heard the man tell the officer.
She looked at them llslleaaly. They (eemed very remote
and unimportant. Then the two face* blurred Into a grinning
gargoyle, the pavement roae very cold and hard, and the
patrol wagon carried an unconaclou* girl who had no lunga
and three months to live, to Jail.
CARRIED HER INTO POLICE COURT
They carried her Into police court next morning.
The stocl-olgeon laid how the had accosted him on the
•treet the night before. Judge Garden knew the stool-pigeon
fee what he waa, unencumbered with heart or conscience.
Ha turned to the girt.
"Did youT' he aaked
8h» looked at him ll*tle**ly and without fear
' He »poke to tnr and I did not hear him." she gaipeil
asked him what he had »ald. Th«i the officer came and I do
not remember any more.'*
Judge Gordon cleared hi* throat.
"I put the caae In the hand* of the ln»pectnr. H he an
nounced.
There waa a mlat In Inspector Mike's eye* aa the story
went on
"I went up and talked to her In her cell after that. At
least I talked and she would nod or amllc She waa no dog
gone weak from coughing, the poor little kid, that ahe couldn't
apeak. I.ord, ahe waa thin —Juat like a shadow. Her ear* were
dead wax white, and her fare and fingernail* that drah gray,
that don't mea.ll nothln' but a ticket to the long sleep
"She managed to gasp out what the doctor had told her,
and that the had juat aa aoon spend her laat thre« month*
in Jail. It waa warm, anyhow
"She had a funny crooked little smile that got me, all
right. Brave a* a fighting cock she waa. too Well, air- ma'am
I mean —1 came back down here to my office and I waa pretty
blue.
"A man dropped In aftar a whlla and aakad ma to dinner
at tha Frya, and by George, It waa providence. I mat a chap
that night who haa a big cattle range down In Southern Cali
fornia, and ha haa a heart that'a a* big aa tha range. I told
him about tha little girl whoae lunga had quit on her, and ha
aald he'd take her down and let her ride In the aun.
"She waa ao weak that we were afraid the trip might he
ton much, but »he wanted to go. Said It waa a aportln' chance
and It didn't matter auch an awful lot after all. I took her to
the train and aald 'goodbye!'"
Inspector Mike's voice trailed off Into silence
That la the atory of the girl who had three month* to live
aa It happened two year* ago
But there'a an epilogue. It'a a plctura that cam* to In

Already It la faded and smudgy from much exhibiting. The

7,000 TO LOSE
51.50 RATE BY
STATE OODEO
After September 1 It Will
Cost $3.50 to Have Phone
Installed
PARTY LINES HIT, TOO
An increase in telephone
rates amounting to more than
$56,000 a year was the dose
handed to Seattle by the state
public service commission in
a ruling, announced Wednes
day, which will go into effect
here September 1.
The opinion, findings and f
new rules governing the Pa- i
cific Telephone & Telegraph '
company's operations thruout «
the -tate was signed by Com
missioners Blaine. Lewis and
Spinning, August 5, but print
ed copies did not reach the
city utilities department until
Wednesday.
The 29 pages of technical
printed matter contain two
radical rulings that will affect
Seattle rates.
One is that the corporation
mav hereafter charge $3.50
"connection service charge/*
unless the new patrons sim
ply take up service of a phone
*dv umjalltd. . „
The citr utilities depsrtm«fv*i
timated that an arerage of 2.73S
new phones were Instailed annually,
during the last three year*. This
meant an increase of approximately
IS.fiOO added to the burden of tele
phone user*.
The other radical change ia the
elimination all "obsolete rates."
7,000 Lose 91.50 Rate
Thin mean* that all telephone
tieers. and there are approximately
7 000 of them, who constructed un
der the old 11.50 a-month rate, wtll
1 ave to pay the f2 rate after Sep
tember 1.
Some of them will have to pay a
little higher rate, according to
rarty classifications.
The cltv utilities department hu
cftlmated that the Increased rates
from this ruling will total approKl.
mately $46,800 a year.
All rates, from now on, will con
form to a schedule on file with the
commission.
No Party Business Lines
H eliminates, for Instance, two
ind four party business phonea,
snd unlimited apartment hoasa
service on one phone.
These changes will all lncraaa*
the revenue of the telephone cor
poration. and Increase the coat at
living burden on patrons.
The order followed the rommla
sion's Inquiry Into the valuation of
the telephone Interests In th«
state, when It was brought to light
that the corporation had listed "un
accounted for assets of $1,000,000."
Plant'! Value Fixed
In the report, Seattle telephone
Investments are listed at $>>,799.-
<iO2. and revenue (under the old
i.ystem) at $1.(539,724 r year. The
expenses ule at $1,459,528 an
nually. and the net revenue at
$180,156.
A net return of 2.6.1 per cent was
estimated, under the old way of op
erating. and the new authorization
of "obsolete rates" will increase th«
return to T>.3r> per cent, while other
new rules will Increase this still
more. Just how much the commis
sioners fall to make clear In the 2#-
pago report
The whole Inquiry started Mar
31. and the commission called itself
he complainant, and named the cor
poration the respondent.
The general result is an order to
Increase (he monopoly revenues In
practically every city and town la
the state.
