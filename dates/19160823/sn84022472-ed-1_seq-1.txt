something like $75,000, allowed, by the

I The first' matter, wennitely decided!
by the combined boards was that all

B. & tl SOUGHT
k WITHOUT DELAY
Boston, Aug. 23. The immediate ap
pointment of a temporary receiver for
the Boston & Maine railroad, to be fol
lowed as soon as possible by a perma
nent receiver, was asked for In the
bill in equity filed yesterday, it be
came known today, when the papers
were made a matter of record in the
United States , district court. Close
followers of the situation pointed out
a court decree fulfilling the requests
would bind closely to ,e Boston &
Maine control of lines under lease and
make impossible any independent ac
tion by their officials. It was the ob
jection of certain leased line interests
which made impossible the reorganiza
tion of the road without receivership.
As a reason for the proposed receiv-
l-ershlp, the petitioner, the . Interconti
nental Rubber- company, of Jersey
City, N. J., states that the company's
Credit Is so poor It cannot Issue bonds
at a reasonable price and that it is
unable to raise money on short term
notes. ''.''
"The "road's inability to make pay
ments on the notes and to procure ex
tensions again -will result in a multi
plicity of suits," the bill states, "and
a race of diligence to secure attach
ments on every available bit of -property
owned by the company. If this
condition were . allowed to go on It
would be to the great loss of the bond
holders whose notes are not due for
many years and whose only recourse
is receivership."

Brotherhood Meeting Thrown Into Uproar as Em'
ployes, Indignant at Lack of Action, Demand! ,
' Results Committeeman Declares That Heads ;
of Railroads Are Purposely Playing For Timei
and That Their Answer Should Be Given To I
President Wilson at Once.
Washington, Aug. 23 The railroad employes' committee
showed such marked signs of unrest today over the delay in.'
the negotiations between President Wilson and the railroad f
executives that the leaders of the men openly expressed fears !
of their ability to hold them much longer. " k
An employes' meeting this morning was thrown !nto an',
uproar' by speeches of members representing a strong minor- ;
ity, which demanded immediate action unless the railroads '
accept the President's plan but the leaders succeeded .in ad
journing the meeting before any vote could be taken on any
of -various proposals. ' '
Some of the men .urged that they
go : home,' leaving the brotherhood
heads with authority to call a strike
If the railroads do not accept the
President's plan. The .meeting ad
journed until 10 o'clock ( tomorrow
morning. ' f l
"It is our Belief," one of the com
mitteemen said, "that the railroads
are playing for time with the Presi
dent Just as they have done , with us
for many months. There Is no rea
son why they should not have given
the President an answer by this time.
They are tiring us out all right and
the men are getting disgusted with the
whole situation, t. I think there are
enough cool headed committeemen
here to control the meetings' a day
or two longer but the discontent is
spreading rapidly." '.
Then, tired of the delay due to the,
railroad - representatives' prolonged
discussion of President Wilson's plan,
gave; free expression to their opinions
at today's nfce.tlng'.' '
The men felt that the railroads
show a disposition ts disregard their
sacrifice of their demand for time and
a half for overtime. ,.,- 1
A. B. Garretson advised them to be
patient and assured them that decisive
action taras expected soon. Before the
meeting the four brotherhood leaders
decided not to issue a statement, ex
pected for publication this morning,
until later In the' day. Mr. Garretson
refused to comment on th'e . situation
other .'than to say that "it is. in he
hands of the President until he acta
there 4s nothing for us to say , or do."
Other , leaders did not hesitate-to
say, however, that plans have been
prepared for instant action in case
the railroad managers decline to ac
cept the President's proposal. -
Three of the railroad presidents to
day reported to the committee, which
is trying to formulate an answer on
behalf of the roads to President WH
son's suggested plaa for meeUng de
mands of the brotherhood's, .the sub
stance - of their conference with the
President at the White House last
night. ' - -
It was understood that the purpose
of that visit was to secure' Mr. Wil
son's specific Ideas on how thtf rail
roads are . to reimburse their treas
uries for the many millions addi
tional expenses which would arise out
of acceding to the President's plan
for an eight-hour wage basis. The at
titude of Presidents on this subject
was not disclosed, but the report was
considered significant as showing in
what direction the railroad heads are
turning in their efforts to reach a con
clusion. . , . '
Louis W. Hill, president of the
Great .Northern Railway and One of
the strongest, opponents of the eight-hour-day,
.declared in a statement
given out today that many Western
roads in particular would have scant
earnings next year and that some
would be forced into receivership by
an eight-hour wage basis.
"This Is a time when, instead of be
ing burdened with useless and uncalled-for
expense, such as demanded . by
the brotherhoods, the railroads should
receive every encouragement in order
to meet the needs of the country," he
said. ' "Such an extra burden as Is
contemplated by these eight-hour de
mands would not- only cut off all pos
sibility of dividends and' extensions,
but throw a number of Western rail
roads into receivership and- cripple
their usefulness to the territory they
serve." -

Newlands and Representative Adam-

JELflf
White House this morning. It is un
derstood he planned to discuss wltli.
them legislation on the railroad strike-)
.situation. Under the President's plan,
lor the settlement of the railroad dis
pute Congress would create a commis
sion to Investigate the working of thai
eight aour day and collateral Issues, i .
' After' their conference with Presi- j '
dent Wilson, Senator Newlands and J
Representative Adamson - said they, v
had discussed the controversy genera
ally but no legislation to meet the sit-' ' y
uatlon had been gone over specifically.';
The -bill adding two members to thsA , ,
interstate commerce commission al- j
ready passed the House was one of the,
measures discussed. , It was under--1 -stood,
bowever, that the creation of a. ; .
permanent commission to Investigate
such controversies . was mentioned.-
Soma railroad officials have taken the1 '
position that If such a ' commission,
were created and railroad employes
prevented from striking- until an in
vestigation is complete, they might ac- i- '
cept' the eight-hour .day. . It was un--
derstood definitely today that the Ball '
road executives had decided to act as
a unit in the present situation.
The program of the railroad execu-:
Uvea as understood today was to Ideal.
first, with the principle of arbitration;
and afterward with the eight-hour day. J
In administration circles today it was ,
declared that the President and the! ,
railroad executives seemed on the way
to an agreement. -
The three presidents who were at
the White House last night left with
President Wilson a comprehensive
statement of the estimated cost of ex-tending-
an eight hour day to all rail-j
road employes and employes in Indus-; '
trial concerns throughout the coun- j '
try. The, railroad presidents hold that;
extension of the- eight-hour day to,' '
railroad ' trainmen eventually means
that it must be extended to all otherfy '
railroad workers and to many of those)
in industrial -pursuits.
Before the meeUng of all the execu .
tives with the committee, today, it beV
came apparent- that there would b i
