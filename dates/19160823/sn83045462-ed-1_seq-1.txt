Strength of Formidable Army at

LONDON. August 23.?Political
developments in the Balkans
overshadow in interest for the \
moment even the important mili-j
tary operations in progress there,!
hut today's dispatches throw lit-!
> tie new light on the situation;
from either a political or military
standpoint.
Army a Formidable One.
With Russian and Italian troops
uiided to the French, British and
Serbian forces already in the field, the
allies have a formidable array of
lighting men on the Macedonian front.
So far. however, its strength has not
been exerted to marked effect.
The Bulgarians have pushed back
both wings and it is only in the center,
in the Vardar valley, that entente advances
have been scored. It seems not
: .r.prooaoie mat mis rc^iun, wiuvu wafers
superior railroad facilities because
of the line running through it from
Saloniki to Uskup, has been selected
as the main avenue along which the
entente thrust is to be made.
Checked by British Artillery.
British artillery has checked the advance
of skirmishers of the central
powers in a sector of the Struma
front, thirty-five miles northeast of
Saloniki. says a war office statement
on operations in the Balkans. Working
parties intrenching opposite Kamarjan
and Cavdarmah, on the same front, also
were dispersed by British artillery,
the statement adds.
An official statement issued last night
in Paris says the allies have captured
a series of heights west of the Vardar
^ river, on the Saloniki front. On both
wings advance detachments have fallen
??ack before the counter offensive of
the Bulgarians.
Berlin Beports Bulg&r Advance.
A Berlin dispatch says that advices
received there from the Balkans indicate
that the Germans and Bulgarians
are advancing on the entire Macedonian
front
There are no indications as to the
objective of the Bulgarians on the
'-astern end of the fighting line, says
the dispatch, but the opinion is held
that Gen. Sarrail's right flank may i
soon be hard pressed. An immediate
result of the Bulgarian offensive is
that the central powers are once more
in direct con tart with Greece.
Guarantees for Greece.
According to a dispatch from Athens,
dated yesterday. Germany and Bulgaria
have given a written undertaking to
Greece that their troops will not enter
Kavala, Drama and Seres.
Kavala. Drama and Seres are the
most important towns in the part of
eastern Macedonia ceded to Greece at
the close of the Balkan wars. Kavala
is on the Aegean coast; Drama is about
twenty miles inland and Seres is near
the Struma river, in the region where
fighting is proceeding between the allies
and the central powers.
Rumania Remains Undecided
as to Participation in War,
According to Berlin Report'
BKRLIN, August 23, by wireless to
Sayville.?Rumania has not decided
whether she will enter the war, in the
opinion of a person characterized by
the Overseas News Agency as "a distinguished
diplomatist who is especiaallv
conversant with Rumanian affairs."
On being asked by the news
agency as to the present situation, he
said:
"Rumania'* attitude is due to her
geographical situation. The country
is virtually surrounded by belligerents.
Rumanian statesmen, therefore, are
guided by the desire to spare their
country the injury which would be una
voidable if it were to become a theater
of war.
Entente Powers Active.
"Since the beginning of the present
conflagration the entente powers, particularly
Russia, have been extremely active
in Rumania. The country is flooded with
Russiar. agents and spies of all descrip- |
tlon. The entente uses money lavishly to
bribe politicians and Influence the press.
This agitation reached its height at the
beginning of the last Russian offensive.
At the same time the entente announced i
t!,:?t an offensive campaign would be in- ;

bit nation ami the Russian offensive also
apparently is slackening.
Awaits Decisive Turn.
"At present Rumania is still undecided.
She probably will not give up her adroit
policy of neutrality, which up to the present
time has given her an enormous gain

really deciHive turn in the war has been
reached. Meanwhile trade relations between
Rumania and the central powers
continue to be normal and active.
"Rumania has been a sphinx and is still
shrouded in a mysterious veil, behind
which political passion and agitation not
only of tii* Rut ianians. but of the entente
agents, reach their highest pitch"
"Gay" Bucharest Now Grave;
as People Prepare for War;
King Sees Teutonic Envoys
LONDON. August 23.?The King of
, Rumania received the German and
t
| Austrian ministers to Bucharest In private
audience Monday, according to a
Cologne dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
Company by way of Amsterdam.
The ministers were received separately
and afterward jointly. It was the
longest audience ever granted by the
Rumanian king to the Teutonic representatives.
Rumania Preparing- for War.
AMSTERDAM, via London, August
23.?Rumania is preparing for war, according
to Dr. Lederer, Bucharest oqtf
respondent of the Berliner Tageblatt.
J A telegraphic dispatch from Dr. Lederer,
dated Sunday, says:
"There is ground for some uneasi
; ness as to the attitude or Kumania.
The outward life of the city is greatly
changed. Gay Bucharest has become
a grave city and all like signs in public
life indicate that everybody is preparing
for eventualities and that the country
Is getting ready for war.
"I still believe that Bratiano is playing
a game with Russia * In political
negotiations at Bucharest von
Hindenburg is now playing the foremost
role."
Counted on His Prestige.
The appointment of Field Marsha!
von Hindenburg to the supreme command
on the eastern front was interpreted
in allied circles as having a political
as well as a military significance.
It was said that Germany believed
the prestige of von Hindenburg's
name would favorably impress Rumania.
NO OVERTURES FOR PEACE
MADE BY GREAT BRITAIN
Positive Statement in Parliament by
Lord Robert Cecil, War Trade
Minister.
LONDON, August 23, 4:55 p.m.?No
peace overtures have been made to
Great Britain, declared Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade and parliamentary
undersecretary for foreign
affairs, in the house of commons today.
Lord Robert's statement was made
in response to a question by Sir James
Henry D&lziel. liberal member* for
Kirkcaldy Burghs, in regard to "peace
rumors."
"No overtures have been made for
peace could be made, and that is from
only one way in which overtures for
peace couldd be made, and that is from
an enemy to the government of this
country. If any such overtures were
made the first thing we should do
would be to consult with our allies,
but no communication of the kind has
been made."
ONE DEAD, SEVERAL DYING,
DUE TO FALL OF BUILDING
NEW YORK, August 23.?Six men are
missing, one is dead and several are dying
in hospitals and a dozen others were
injured today as the result of the sudden
collapse of a five-story brick tenement
in course of construction in the
Bronx.
A score of workmen were in the
building, and more than half this number,
at work in the front part, were
caught in the debris. City building officials
inspected the ruins and charged
that the cement used in the walls was
of an inferior quality.
Several arrests have been made, including
a member of the contracting
firm which was constructing the building.
SENATE. PASSES ARMY BILL.
Revised Measure Goes Back to the
House for Action.
The army appropriation bill with revised
articles of war approved by the
War Department was passed today by
the Senate and now goes back to the
House, where the amendment is expected
to be accepted.
President Wilson vetoed the bill because
the revision on the bill's previous
passage gave exemptions to retired officers
which the War Department disapproved.
WARNED TO OBSERVE CARE.
Postal Employes Held Accountable
for Damage to Mail Packages.
Special warnings to all employes of
the postal service who take part in the
handling of parcel post packages to
exercise all possible care in the handling
of such mail have been issued by
the Postmaster General. All are warned
that they will be held to strict accountability
for damage to the mails
for which they are responsible.
The warning, it is pointed out, was
inspired by the fact that complaints
still come in from patrons of the service
that packages are received in bad
condition, and that investigation of
these complaints has led to the discovery
that in certain instances the
trouble was due to careless and rough
handling of the mails. The means by
which damage to fragile packages may
be avoided are enumerated for the benefit
of those to whom the warning was
addressed.
AMBASSADOR SHARP HERE.
Comes to Confer With Officials and
Take a Rest. ..
William G. Sharp, United States ambassador
to France, is in this city to
confer with the officials regarding Internationa!
questions growing out of
the European war. He declined to discuss
the war, and said he was home
merely for a rest and to complete his
convalescence after a severe attack of
pneumonia.
By a singuar coincidence, Walter H.
Paf?e, i'nited States ambassador to
tlreat Britain, also is In this city at
present on leave of absence, but Secretary
Lansing says there is no significance
in the presence of the two
ambassadors at the same time.
A&MOB PLANT HEARINGS.
Secretary Daniels to Deceive Site and
Sale Proposals.
Consideration of proposals from various
cities, including Washington, suggesting
sites for the eleven-milliondollar
government armor plant, will be
heard by Secretary Daniels September
13, together with such offers as private
manufacturers may submit for the sale
of their establishments to the government.
On that date membera of the general
board and Rear Admiral Strauas, chief
of ordnance, will be present to hear
claims of the cities which have asked
for the plant. A written brief for consideration
of the general board, which
under the law must Anally approve the
site selected by the Secretary of the
Navy, must be Sled to each case.

23.?The artillery commander
Irew his patent curtain of fire and
lever in all the seven weeks of the
iomme battle has the correspondent
tritnessed anything equal to the
show," as the officers call every action,
n the taking: of one of the spurs of
'hieval ridge yesterday afternoon.
Ever since July 1, when the British
ailed in their effort to storm it, Thie'al
ridge has glared at the British,
rho had kept hammering it with gun- |
Ire. The Germans seemed to set the
ame store by it as they did by the
leights of Ginchy and Guillemont, on
heir other flank.
In front of the position conquered |
esterday the British infantry had
een decimated by machine gun fire
uly 1. The trenches were just as
trong as then with deep dugouts, the
esult of two years' building.
Believe Ridge Secure.
Prisoners taken early in the ofensive
said the British never could
btain a foothold on that ridge. Those
aken yesterday who had been at Verlun
said they suffered nothing there at
.11 equivalent to the deluge of British
hells, and that it was impossible for
iuman beings to endure such tomatoes.
On a thousand-yard front both the first
Jerman line and the support trench were
aken. One pair of eyes could not see
nore detail than the correspondent saw
'esterday. The British and Germans enraged
were outlined as clearly as a play
.round the second base could be seen
rom a grandstand. A home company of
he National Guard doing skirmish drill
n camp could not be more distinct when
een from the side lines. It was the very
Inesse of war.
With clear air and a bright afternoon
un over his shoulder, one looked across
he tiny valley toward a slope. There the
litre gruunu w?r? >-ut h,c o4a.-u in
lew British trench, and beyond that,
.cross an area of dead grass and wavy
naize, was the old flrst-line German
rench.
Niagara Bush of Shells.
A Niagara rush of whistling screams
rom capsules of concentrated hell tore
hrough the air and began bursting over
t. Their flashes hugged it in an infernal
cstasy, sweeping it with myriads of bulet*
and fragments, shooting forked
ongues of death Jnto its burrows. To j
how a head and escape being hit. and hit
nore than once, was as hopeless as to
tand up in a thick hailstorm without bang
hit with an icy pellet. Some Germans
/ho had trusted in flight rather than
ticking to a dug-out when the first dash
f projectiles came were seen running
oward the open, away from this swath
f destruction.
Now out of the British trench ap>eared
a row of khaki-tinted mushooms,
the steel helmets the British

in full equipment with all its details
visible. Every flRrure uniform with all
others to the last item as they moved
across the field of dead grass briskly
and steadily. No ominous, wicked staccato
of German machine guns coming
Into action was heard. No machine gunner
could live at his post in that
trench.
Shells All Fall True.
The British line opened to go around
shell craters or other obstacles and
then closed up. Occasionally a figure
dropped and was lost in the grass.
Right into the face of that curtain of
death from shells going only a few
feet over their heads they were moving.
Then suddenly as it was laid the
curtain of shell fire lifted. Not a single
shell out of the thousands had burst
short.
Now the British were going over the
German parapet, their bayonets glistening
in the sun. As they descended
into the trench the earth seemed" to
have swallowed them up. Little clouds
of smoke from bursting bombs rose
from the trench. There was hot work
proceeding out of sight in the burrows.
One after another as though they
were coming to the top of the stairs
heads and shoulders appeared out of
the trench. Each German had his hands
up, and in file the prisoners moved past
a Briton standing on the parapet. These
Germans who had not waited to be
bombed out of their dug-outs, but hsul
surrendered, came legging it at top
speed back toward the British firstline
trenches.
What about the Germans who had
fled back toward the German support
trench? A light machine gun the
British had put up rattled into their
backs. Ahead of them was the British
curtain of fire, now lifted on to the
Herman support trench. They seemed
to disappear into the earth, some shot
down, some wounded, others seeking
security in shell craters. Few will survive.
One figure alone holds the stage
for a fraction of a minute there in that
lifeless space around them. Tall and
bold a German officer stands up on the
edge of a communication trench and
looks around. He goes down abruptly
<io n iic nau ucoii mt a imrci wow DacK
of the knees.
Charge Supporting Trenches.
Now British helmets rise from the
German iirst line and start on with another
charge to the German support
trench. They will clean up any Germans
lying in shell craters on the way.
They grow dim with distance and in the
fading light, but they get there. They
have the support trench, their signals
say. And that bunch of running German
prisoners coming toward the British
rear as fast as they can is enveloped
in some shell bursts. The German curtain
of Are is now being laid on the old
first-line British trench area, which explains
why all the prisoners taken do
not reach the collection stations alive.
Those seen fairly out of range of shell
fire were smiling and seemed much relieved.
"They will have a good square meal
over in the camp by that clump of trees
tonight," said the general, "and they
have been under fire for the last time in
this war."
Walking with them were thei British
wounded, also smiling.
Bit by bit gains are made between
big attacks. The British now are within
1,000 yards of Thiepval, maintain
their positions in Guillemont and are
within 300 yards of Ginchy and of Mar.
tinpuich.

Carnegie, who has returned from

that the millionaire philanthropist

contrary, he waa enjoying "very good

$10,000 Each.
"The men who will form the tariff commission,
about to be created, ought to receive
$10,000 a year, and not $7,500," said
Representative Rainey of Illinois today.
Representative Raiq^y, author of the
tariff commission section of the revenue
bill which has passed the House and is
now before the Senate, expressed himself
today as disgusted with the manner in
which the republican votes cut down the
salaries of the propoesd commission when
the bill was in the House. Acting according
to precedent, he said, the ways and
means committee placed the salaries ct
the tariff commission members at $10,000
each. When the bill was up in the House
Representative Green of Iowa moved to
cut this figure to $7,500.
Question of Salary Debated.
It was late in the afternoon of July 10,
and the House displayed an overweening
desire to quit and go home.
Representative Green spoke for less than
a minute. Representative Rainey answered
in about a hundred words, explaining
that the ways and means committee
had gone over the matter carefully and
that the best grade of experts could not
be obtained for $7,500 a year. Representative
Cullop of Indiana, a democrat,
who generally follows the action of democratic
committees, made a long speech,
however, in favor of the republican mo- ,
tion. and, much to the surprise of everybody,
especially Representative Rainey,
the Green motion carried by 136 to 93.
There was no chance of a record vote.
Says Republicans Did It.
"Republican votes did it," Representative
Rainey said today, "and I cannot for '
the life of me see why they did so.
"Under the Payne tariff Congress ere- ,
ated a board of customs appeals, the i
members of which receive $9,000 a year,
and the proposed tariff commission !
would be a superior body to that board.
The federal reserve board members get \
$12,000 each, the federal trade commis- ;
sioners get $10,000 and the rural credits '
commissioners get $10,000. There is no
reason why the members of. the tariff
commission should not receive $10,000." 1
The House passed the bill with the s
$7,500 salaries instead of $10,000, and s
the Senate now has the bill b.efore it, ]
with the salaries at the lower figure. i

The administration of the university }

"The experience of large universities,"

SILENT VOTE HOLDS
BALANCEOFPOWER
260,000 in California Have
Refrained From Declaring
Party Affiliation.
REPUBLICANS CLAIM
SUPPORT OF MAJORITY
\
Democrats Believe, However, That
National Policies, Kindred to
Those of State, Will Win.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
SAN FRANCISCO, August 23.
?When the voters of this state
registered for the nominating
primaries, to be held August 29,
about 260,000 of them refrained
from declaring their party affiliation.
Exercise of this option on
non-declaration puts them in position
to vote at the polls in November
for democratic or republican
candidates, as they see fit.
The number was 300,000 at the outset,
but the frantic appeals of party
managers induced about 40,000 to sign
up.
J. his gicai iiuu-uccmrou vuw, i cjji csenting
the independent, silent, thoughtful
political sentiment of the state, is
sufficient to hold the balance of power
between the two parties. It hangs
heavy over the head of the party
leaders.
Who Is to Get This Vote.
Who is to get it? The republicans
claim that four-fifths of the non-declared
vote is republican. The democrats
base most of their hope of vie- ;
tory upon the assumption that the
figures represent men who are wed to ]
no party, bound to no candidate per se,
but on election day will vote for the :
candidate and party whose principles
and acts more nearly meet their views
and demands.
Until the primaries are held and the j
fight over the United States senator- ;
ship, or rather the fight against Hiram i
Johnson, enters upon its second and
crucial stage, it would be folly to attempt
to forecast the course which the
electorate of California will pursue
in November.
It is feasible, however, to describe
conditions as they exist, speak of the
aims and hopes of the parties and pick
out the lines of battle, which details
furnish an important chapter in current
national politics.
Democratic Viewpoint.
Gavin McNab, one of the brainiest
and most resourceful of the democratic
leaders in the state, summed up the
democratic expectations to The Star's j
correspondent, as follows:
"Californians are thinkers and are
thinking deeply, regardless of aforetime
party affiliations. They are thinking
of the humanities above and beyond
discarded fetiches of party worship.
Democrats hold that it is reasonable
to expect the voters to recognize
that President Wilson and the democratic
administration represent nationally
the things they have stood for in
their own state and which constitute
their political doctrine?the income tax,
child labor legislation, workmen's compensation
and other things.
"The democratic administration has
matched state demands with national
legislation.
"The democrats have reasons to depend
upon the support of the bulk of
the labor vote for their national candidate.
"They expect that the majority of the
woman's vote, which will be cast for
the presidency for the first time this
fall, will stand by the President for
keeping their sons and brothers out of

Basis of Bepublican Hope.
The republican hope of victory is
gathered irf". a symposium of opinions of
republican leaders. It might be stated
in a sentence?return to form. It is
contended that California is normally a
repuolican state by 100,000, whiclf majority
has been split and diverted by
iactionalism that now they believe will
be yo per cent healed in November.
It is contended California is essentially
a protective tariff state and the
protectionist spirit will rise as bull
moosery is submerged. They deny that
the woman's vote will be swayed by
emotional sentiment alone, but will take
a broader scope.
The republicans declare that in recent
successive contests at the primaries
they have demonstrated that the
republican vote of the state is returning
to form and that in a national election,
with the choice being restricted to
a, democratic or a republican presidential
candidate, progressives and regulars
alike will support the republican
national ticket.
These arguments have reference to
the presidential contest as differentiated
from the factional fight over the
aenatorship. That, as explained in a
previous dispatch, is a struggle for control
of the state organization, and as a
means thereto involves the victory or
lefeat of Hiram Johnson for the nomination.
As Hiram Johnson and Chester Rowell
are committed to the support of Hughes,
republicans believe that after the primaries
have determined the nomination
the presidential ticket will command support
upon its merit as a republican 4icket
appealing to all republicans.
Unbiased opinion here is that Gov.
Johnson will make a close run for the
senatorial nomination. To begin with, he
has the party organization, and his machine
is acknowledged to be one of the
best of the kind. He is a wonderful campaigner
himself and is making a whirlwind
campaign.
Still Will Be Candidate.
Bear in mind that even if he should not
3ecure at the primaries a combined regular

Johnson would still be on the ticket in

[or senator to be voted for. He is the
progressive candidate for the nomination,
seeking regular republican support, him?lf
promising to support Hughes for the
presidency.
California is in the throes of a prohibiten
contest. Two constitutional amend- ,
nents are submitted, one for outright prolibition
within a year and the other to 1

This means a tremendous outpouring of

President Wilson held a conference
this morning with Senator

Adamson. chairmen, respectively,
of the Senate and House commerce
committees, whom he
called to the White House relative
to the threatened railroad
T1 f '
siriKe. j. ms conierence, toilowing
so quickly upon the night conference
of the subcommittee of railroad
presidents at the White
House seeking some understanding
as to what would be coming
to them in the way of increased
rates if they should agree, at the
President's solicitation, to accept
the eight-hour day entailing some-t
thing like $50,000,000 additional
operating expense, was considered
portentous.
If they can get assurance of administrative
recognition of arbitration for the
settlement of all future industrial disputes,
and some satiefactory offset for the
additional cost entailed, it was admitted
by several railroad leaders today that
they might and probably would acospt
the eiaht-hour day.
While they are In long sessions scheming
how they can drive the best possible
bargain In this matter with the government,
the big committee of 640 general
chairmen representing the employes is
growing very restive. In a restless meeting
today the belief was expressed that
the railroad chiefs are only playing for
time. The brotherhood leaders let It be
known that they "fear they will be unable
to hold the men in check much longer"
and the statement is made that they are
ready to call a strike the moment the
railroads reject the President's proposal
for settling the strike.
Specific Legislation Not Discussed.
After their conference with President
Wilson, Senator Newlands and Representative
Adamson said they had discussed
the strike controversy generally,
but that no legislation to meet the situation
had been gone over specifically. The
bill adding two members to the interstate
commerce commission, which has already
passed the House and which will come before
the Senate Friday, was one of the
measures discussed.
Senator Newlands said after a conference
that he would press his bill to increase
the interstate commerce commission
from seven to nine members and to
divide the commission into groups as soon
as the revenue bill is passed.
"The President is very desirous that
the bill be passed," said Senator Newlands.
"and 1 shall urge it next week.**'
Beyond saying that they approved ths
President's course in handling the railroad
situation and that they were ready to
push any legislation needed. Senator Newlands
and Representative Adamson would
not discuss their conference.
Permanent Commission Discussed.
It was understood, however, that the
creation of a permanent commission to
investigate such controversies was one
of the subjects mentioned.
Some of the railroad officials have
taken the position that if such a com
mission were created and railroad emninvM
nrevented from striking until
an investigation is complete, they
might accept the eight-hour day.
The calling of the commerce committee
chairmen to the White House and the assurance
given by Senator Xewlanda that
he will push his bill for a large commission
are believed to indicate that a movement
is developing for sending the contingent
features to the interstate commerce
commission for investigation.
Possibility of passing an eight-hour law
for railroads was discussed today amonf
several congressional leaders, but no definite
program was evolved, and it was
understood that no action in this direction
would be taken unless the President's
efforts failed.
President Wilson plans to see Senator
Newlands and Representative Adameon
again, probably late today, and expects
to receive another call from the commutes
of the railroad executives some time
before tomorrow.
It was understood definitely today
that the railroad executives had decided
to act as a unit in handling the
present situation. For a time yesterday
it appeared possible that a decision
might be reached for each road
or system to act independently.
Program of Bail way Heads.
The program of the railroad executives,
as understood today, was to
deal nrei W1 in mr Irrtiiuyia ui ftrDltratlon
and afterward with the eight*
hour day.
If means can be found for guaranteeing
arbitration In future dispute*
at least some of the railroad executives
xre understood to favor aoquieseenoe
with the eight-hour day demand.
In administration circles today It
was declared that both the President
snd the railroad executives seemsd ts
be on the way to an agreement.
