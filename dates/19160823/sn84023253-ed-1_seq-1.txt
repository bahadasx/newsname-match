MAURICE HOOKER DIES
Following Sudden Illness Monday Aft
ernoon and Subsequent Stroke of
Paralysis.
The sudden death of Maurice
George Hooker, 37, which occurred,
about 9.4 5 Monday night, at the home
of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Georga
Hooker, on Portland street, following
a paralytic shock sustained late in the
aftenoon, came as a shock to the fam
ily and to his many friends in the
community. It is thought the stroke
was brought on by the excessive heat
and by overwork at his duties as cash
ier at the local express office. Al
though evidently not feeling in his
usual good health for the past two or
three days, Mr. Hooker had made no
complaint of not feeling well at home
until Sunday night when he retired
early." Monday morning he went
to work as usual, but at 11.30 cam
home and lay down but did not un
dress. In the middle of the afternoon
when asked how he was feeling he
made no definite answer and did not
seeni to be any worse. Dr. Fjtch was
called and on arriving about 5 o'clock
found paralysis had set in on the lefi
side. Dr. Ross was called in con
sultation. But little hope was held
for his rec.overy although the death
which occurred at 9.45 was entirely
unexpected.
Mr. Hooker was a most popular
young man in town and made many
friends both in a social and business
way.
His sterling worth and attention to
business attracted the attention ofhis
superiors in"the express company and
led to his appointment as cashier ot
the local office' three years ago.
Maurice George Hooker was born
in Danville December 9, 18 79, one of
a family of eight children. He re
mained with his parents on their farm
in Danville until they came to St.
Johnsbury 14 years ago. He was em
ployed in Fairbanks shops for a short
time, and nine years ago entered the
employ of the American Express Co.,
where he had risen to his present po
sition of trust. He was a member o
the Danville lodge of Masons and ot
the Knights of Pythias, and was sec
retary of the Planet club of St. Johns
bury. Besides his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
George Hooker, he leaves two broth
ers, Harry E., of Beverly, Mas3., and
Elmer E., of this place. Three sisters
also survive, Mrs. Kenneth Cross,
Sadie A., and Julia M. Hooker of St.
Johnsbury.
The death comes as a severe shock
to the bereaved family as it follows
closely the death of an older son in
Boston less than a year ago.
The funeral will be held from his
late home on Portland street, Wed
nesday at 2 p. m. Rev'. George A.
Martin, pastor of the Grace Methodist
Episcopal church' will conduct the
services and the interment will be In
the Mount Pleasant cemetery.
