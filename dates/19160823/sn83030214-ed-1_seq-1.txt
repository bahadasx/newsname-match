Churchill Asserts There Is
No Certainty of Speedy

London, Aug-. 22. "I think inih<- dim

Qaatgfl told the Houae of Commons to?
day.
The Secretary for War contrastod
what he termod the extraordinary
change in a few months in the relative
positions of the Kntentc Allies and th*
i eatral Pewaia on all the fronts ex?
cept Mesopotamia, where climatic con?
ditions. had kept the British forces
quiescent.
Mr. Lloyd George said that criti-,
cisms of the British operations on the1
Somme front. on the ground of their
failure to break through the German
lines, were unjustit'ied. The Germans,
having two alternatives, chose the al
ternative of bringing troops and |BBfl
from Verdun to prevent thfl British
from breaking through.
"That suited our purpose," the War
Secretary continued. "It reheved the
pressure on Verdun and prevented the
enemy from pouring his forces into
th< Raaalafl theaUfl to gupport the
Austrians against G^icral Bru.siloff's

"The German accounts of our losses
on the Somme -re ludicrously cx
aggerated. Our losses, though deplor
able, have been relatively low as com?
pared with those ef the Germans. The
French and ourselves have captured
positions on the Somme front whencc
the course of the campaign is visible,
and I think in the dim distance we can
see the end.
"France is equipped, and Russia is
rapidly becoming equipped. Italy's
equipment has amazod her best friends.
Germany has missed her chance, and
she kaoe sit.
"It would be a mistake to underrate

U. S. WARNS TURKS
REGARDING MASSACRES
State Department Mopes to Pre?

trroin TV Trlbunfl Rurxau 1
Washington, Aug. 22. Turkey was
warned, in a note sent to-day, that any
massaerc of Armenians in Persia would
be "regarded with grent disfavor" by
the I'nited Stntes. Reports which have
rertched the State Department indicatrd
thnt wholesale massncres of Christian
Armenians in Persia were plnnned, and
it ia hoped the consummntion of any
such pian may be ilefcated.
Protests over previous massncres in
Turkey have brought no satisfaction
from the Turkish government, and will
not be pressed by the I'nited States, it
was aaid. The State Depnrt'ment be?
lieves, however, that the cases are not
parallel, aa in the former a foreign
government could have no proper
ground for protest against any inhu
manities viaited by the Turka because
they were confined to their own aub
jecta. But if the terrorism is earried
into Persia the interest of neutrals, It
Is believed, will be unquestioned.
What aetion will be taken if Presi?
dent Wilson's warning is not heeded ifl
not disclosed. Administration leaders
say the note contains ^trong language.

[Pr Ctflfll to Th* TtT i " ]
I.ondon, Aug. 22. A Hntish sub?
marine at last has ferreted out a
German battleship and made a suc?
cessful torpedo attack on her. Lieu?
tenant Commander Turner. of the E-23,
reported to thc Admirnlty to-day that
a warship of the Naasau class of
18,000 toni had been struck twice and,
he believeil, sent to thc bottom.
Apparently the attack took plaee
Ifl the North Sea soon after the clush
between thc mosquito flerts last Sat?
urday. The first torpedo damaged the
German and tive destroyers began to
escort her back to harbor. The sub?
marine followed and Srflflj a second
torpedo, which thc British commander
thinks was successful.
Submarines Held in I.each.
Throughout the war British sub?
marine commanders have bewailed thc
fact that they were denied the oppor?
tunity io outdo the exploits of their
German rivnls. The Kaiser's fleet haa
preferred thc seclusion of the Kiel
Canal while German merchantmen
were being swept off the seaa.
Commander Turner seems to have
met the opportunity for which so
manv if his comrades have pleaded.
Although the announcement is re
aerved for the naval authonties lo.iv?

Commissioners on

WILL SETTLE
ALL PROBLEMS
Withdrawal of Troops
First Question To
Be Discussed.
Washington, Aug. 22. ? Secretary
Lansing announced to-night that the
American members of the joint com?
mission to undertake settlement of dif?
ference.* between the United States
and Mexieo would be Franklin K. Lane,
Secretary of the Interior; Judge George
Gray, of Wilmington, Del., and Dr.
John R. Mott, of Montclair, N. J.
All the commissioners have accepted
their appointments. The Mexican
members were named some time ago,
and arrangements for their meeting
will be made immediately by Secretary
I.ansing and Fliseo Arredondo, General
Carranza's ambassador-designate. Virt
ually the only question to be decided
is where the session shall be held. The
Mesleaafl are understood to prefer
some resort on the New Jersey coast.
Brandeis I'nable to Serve.
Secretary Lane, who will head the
American group, wm the first member
selected. Associate Justice Brandeis
was I'resident Willso-i's second c'-oice,
bLt after a conference with Chief
Justice White he decided his duties
would not permit him to serve.
The Mexican commissioners are Luis
Babrera, Minister of Finance; Ygnacio
Bonillas and Alberto Pani. Both of the
latter are engineers, and Bonillas is a
graduate of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technogoly.
Probably thc first problem taken up
by the joint commission will be the
proposed withdrawal of American
troops from Mexieo.
Troop Problem First.
As General Funston has recommend?
ed the recall of General Pershing's ex?
pedition, this is expected to be agreed
to by the American members. General
Carraaaa appointed his commissioners
"prefernDly" to discuss this question,
the ncj-otiation of a protocol covering
the crossing of the international bor?
der in pursuit of banditg and investi?
gation of the interests which might be
behind the raids into American terri?
tory. The Ualted States refused to
limit the discussion to these sunject*
and others undoubtedly will be gone
into.
lt has been sugge?ted that out of the
diaeuaaion of econom.c conditions tn
Hexico n.ight come assurances that
?rould mahfl it possible for American
nnancial and commereial interests to
offer aid in the rehabilltation of the
republic.
Guard May (Juit Border.
There is a belief here that with?
drawal of Pershing's expedition would
be followed aeoa by the recall of the
National Guard from the border.
Dr John R. Mot* has heen idenftt.ed

ASK WILSON TO SHOW
HOW TO GET REVENUE
WashinRton, Aug. 22.?
The three railway executives
who conferred with Presi?
dent Wilson at the White
House to-nii-ht asked him to
state specifically, it is under?
stood, how he expected the
railroads to make up the miil?
ions of dollars which the
managements say it will cost
them to put into effect the
eight-hour day they are
asked to grant.
What the President said in
reply none of the committee?
men would reveal. Hereto
fore, according to the rail?
road men, Mr. Wilson has
dealt with this phase of the
subject only in the most gen?

Mercury Climbs to 94, Offi

ture 100 to 120.
The mercury in the Weather Bu
reau's official thermometer broke all
altitudo records for the year yesterday.
It had rested uneasily nbout the M
mark all of Monday night. Yesterday
morning it began to ris* enrly. At 3 in |
tho afternoon it had cr?pt up to 94 and
had made the day the hottest of the
year.
Loud plaudits from owners of beach
reaerta, soda fountains and ice fac
torlea greeted this feat Kqually loud
outcries were forthcoming from vic
tima of linen collars, waiatcoata or
prickly heat.
Four deaths due to heat occurred
Nineteen porosns in the greater city
were prostrated.
Remember, the Weather Bureau
thermometer is in a shady little alcove
on top of the Whitehall Building. It
did not mingle with the more common
of its kind far below on the streets,
where pavements reflected baek the
rays of the sun and no breeze pene
trated. Thcrmometers at pavement
level registered 100 in the shade and
shot up to 118 and 120 in the sun.
Only one exienuating circumstance
could be found yesterday. The humid
ity was inconspicuous all day. When
thc temperature stood at 94 it regis?
tered a iowly 33.
Monday night came near being a rec?
ord breaker. Only Uicc has it been
hotter in the last forty-six years. Not
since Julv 2, 1901, has it been equalled
*,fter 3 o'eloek the mercury dropped
rapidly. Late last night it was resting
quietly at 71.
Those who died from heat yesterday

ALL NIGHT DISCUSSION
ENDS IN DISAGREEMENT
Late Conference with President Wilson
Indicates That Definite Aetion Will Be
Taken Not Later Than To-day.
[From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune.]
Washington, Aug. 22.?A committee of eight railroad presi?
dents appointed by the executives in Washington to draft a reply
to President Wilson's settlement proposal wrestled with the
problem all day without reaching a solution. It was confidently
expected, however, that the numerous suggestions emanating
from the entire group of railway heads would be crystallized
into shape for another meeting with the President before to
morrow night.
The difference of opinion evident among the executives and
managers when they met yesterday after hearing Mr. Wilson's
plea for agreement with the employes was even more apparent
at the sessions of the smaller group at the Metropolitan Club.
Several of th'e committee were for immediate acceptance of the
plan without further parleying, while a few others took the op
posite stand and insisted that the railroads stand pat on their
demand for arbitration.

Husband Up Amazon.
[Hr T?lfgraph to Th? Tribune ]
Philadelphia, Aug. 22. Dr. A. Ham?
ilton Rice, the South American ex-l
plorer, who had penetrated far into the
upper reaches of the Amazon and the
Oror.oco, is going once more into the
hinterland of that country, aecom?
panied by his wife, formerly Mrs.
George D. Widener, widowed by the
Titanic disaster.
The explorer intends to leave New?
port, R. L, on October 15. He will sail
on the big steam yacht Alberta, for?
merly the property of King Leopold II
of Belgium, and given by him to the;
Baroaeaa Vaughan.
The Royal Geographical Society of
London is finaneing the expedition,
arhich it ia believed will pierce further
into the Amazon jungle than any which
has preceded it. Mrs. Rice will desert
the gayety and luxury of Newport to
be at her husband's side in his journey
through a land swarming with poison
ous insects and noted for many varie
ties of fever. Three members of the
London Geographical Society will also
be of the party.
Dr. Rice has a long and brilliant rec?
ord of exploration in South Ameriea.
In 1907 he was believed to have been
lost in an attempt to reach the source
of the Orinoco. In returning to civili
zation, he traveresed the mountains,
plains and jungies lying between that
river and the Amazon.
The explorer is a Harvard graduate.
While still at the university, he joined
in his junior year an expedition into
the Arctic. Three years after his
graduation from Harvard, in 1901, he
made his tirst trip to South Ameriea,
traveliing from Quito to the Amazon
by way of the Orinoco.

? Conference wlth Wilson.
A conference between three of the
railroad executives and Prt.iiden.
Wilson to-night ia believed to presage
definite aetion to-morrowon thr-Presi?
dent's settlement plan by all the tf?
ty-odd executives now at the capital.
None would say whether the rail?
roads had decided to capitulate 0:1
any modiried interpretation of the
Wilson proposal, but it is believe 1
that the conference was held flrith
the idea of discussing with Mr. Wil?
son just what form the roads' reply
to his proposition will take.
The following statement was is?
sued by the executives at 11 o'clock
to-night:
"Hale Holden, president of tha
Chieago, Hurlington & Quincy; K. S.
Lovett, chairman of the Union Pa?
citic, and Daniel Willard, president
of the Baltimore & Ohio, went to thfl
White House this evening at X :M>
o'clock and had a conference with the
President, lasting about an hour,
during which the general situation
was discussed. The conference BTM
requested by the committee of rail?
way executives.
"There was another meeting of the
railway executives at 6 o'clock thii
evening, and they will rneet again ar
11:30 o'clock on Wednesday morn?
ing."
Statement Held Back.
Still realizing the uncertainty of
the situation, one of the most sig
nificant indications was the fact that
a lengthy statement pr. pared for is
suanee by the railroad executives
early in the evening did not mate
rialize for the expectant newspaper
eorrespondents. lt was ready to be
handed out when Mr. Holden, Mr.
Willard and Mr. Lovett slipped away
from their hotel and hurried to the
White House in an automobile.
None of the three visitors to Mr.
WilflOD would diseuss the objflflJt or
sigmticanee of their call. They ____??
appeared from inquirers as flOOfll as
Mr. Willard gave out the preceding
non-committal statement. Mr. Will*
ar>l would not be questioned at all.
Neither would Mr. Lovett. Mr. Hol?
den simply phrased the BtatfltBBItt in
different language when The Tri'mne
corn-spondent called him on the tele
phone. He rtfttttsj to say whether
the situation wa.-. BflON hopeful or
less.
It na* learned, however. that tho
committee of eight executives ap
