THE COOK COUNTY NEWS-I
QRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN* AUGUST 23, 1916.
SUSPECTED MAN SAWS HIS
WAY OUT OF COUNTY JAIL
Make His Escape About Six O'olook
Last Friday Afternoon. Sheriff
Discovers Absence When
Bringing Supper.
Sheriff Lien made the discovery
last Friday night that Harry Davis,
who was held as a suspect in the
post office robbery in this village,
had broken jail and was gone.
At first it was thought that the
lock had been picked but upon closer
examination it was found that the
lock bar had been sawed off, the bar
being nearly three inches wide and
one inch thick. The job done shows
the expertness of Mr. Davis, and ac­
cording to Post Office Inspector
Fleming who was here last week, the
safe blowing was done in an ex­
pert manner.
Immediately after the discovery
of the escape Sheriff Lien organized
a posse, and placed them on all the
roads leading from the village. The
fugitive was not seen by anyone un­
til Saturday night, when he was seen
on the road passing the Herman Hel
merson residence. He was next seen
near Carribou Point by some tour­
ists bound for this place. Immed­
iately upon their getting in sight of
him he ducked into the woods. On
Monday morning George Nelson and
a companion were fishing in the
Poplar River about a mile from the
mouth, and as they were going up
the river they came upon a man
resting near a little camp fire. He
tried to hide behind some bushes
and the description of the man tal­
lies with the man wanted. Upon
investigation it was found that Mr.
Davis left very soon after the boys
had seen him and went up the river
a little farther and walked down the
old Lockport Railway right of way.
Some time on Monday night he was
seen on the road about a quarter of
a mile west of Lutsen by Dyer Ryn
olds, who was on guard there, and
upon being told to stop and hold up
his hands, took to his heels and took
a chance on the shots that Dyer took
at him. It was intensely dark and
impossible to aim at all.
Sheriff Lien returned to the vil­
lage this afternoon and he iftforms
us that the man has been traced into
the woods back of Tofte, and that
the heavy rain on Monday has swol­
len the Temperance River so that it
will be impossible for him to cross
except on the bridge, and that a
constant watch will be kept on that
and also at Cross River. Sheriff
Lien has hardly slept since the es­
cape, and has been untiring in his
efforts to capture the criminal.
The fugitive is probably living on
berries and what vegitables he can
pick up out of gardans that he
happens to pass, as no reports have
been received of any houses being
broken into and provisions taken.
Mr. Love, of Port Arthur is visit­
ing with Mr. and Mrs. Semour
Mitchell and family this week.
Mrs. T. P. Aarsvold returned to
her home at Peterson, Minn., on the
Thursday evening boat, after a few
weeks visit with relatives here.

boat for a visit with relatives ir
the village and on Good Harbor Hill
Mr. and Mrs. Oluf Sather returned
to their home in Duluth pn the Mon
day evening boat, after a short visit
with relatives and friends here.

arrive here tomorrow and will hold

ing at 7:30 in the Norwegian church
in Grand Marais, Friday evening at
7:30 in the Maple Hill town hall,
Saturday evening at 7:30. in the

Young People's Society Bethel will

The skeleton of a tall man was un­
earthed close to the Minnesota river,
above the mouth of the Blue Earth, by
the washing of the river. It is thought
to be that of one of the early French
voyagers who established a fort at the
juncture of the two rivers more than
two hundred years ago.

OBITUARY OF OLD LAND
MARK AT CROSS
An old landmark is gone! A land­
mark from the time when a team
could hardly travel over the road in
summer, when roads were merely
winter roads, needing the soft snow
cover to fix the grooves and make
the surface passable when the road
was little more than a dog trail,
over which the mail was hauled to
Grand Marais along the shore of Lake
Superior through an evergreen, un­
tamed country. One of the first
bridges crossing the many streams
which traverse this country, making
it so picturesquely broken—is gone.
The old bridge at Cross River is no
more.
It is with a pang in my heart that
I write it, for it was an old acquain­
tance. But the way in which it had
to go, the circumstances that shroud­
ed its exit out of this world—glor­
ious or sinful, according to the angle
from which you view it—is a stab
in the heart.
The bridge, since the opening of
the new road, was doomed as a trav­
eling link between the two sides of
the river was condemned and shut
off from traffic. It was fenced off
from the east with a wire fence
which bordered the eastern bound­
ary of H. E. Redmyer's estate, and
on the west side no road led to it,
the old road having been automatic­
ally reverted to the property from
which it was originally extracted
and now is part of a field plowed
and sown with oats.

Thus the bridge was completely
framed in within Mr. Redmyer's land
and could not be reached by anybody
without the owner's permission to
pass over his property. Tho shut off
and unavailable for the public it was
of use to himself in crossing the
river in order to reach the eastern
extension of his land. It was also
a considerable shortcut for him (10
times as short as the way around),
when he wanted to do business in
the post office opposite the bridge,
or if he had some errand to Cross
River dock. But his intentions to
so use the old bridge—(thus saving
the county the unnecessary expense
of tearing it down and removing it,
if it was within the jurisdiction of
the county to touch it, since it was
entirely within Mr. Redmyer's ter­
ritory), and to conserve it as long as
it wouid last, were in a curious and
