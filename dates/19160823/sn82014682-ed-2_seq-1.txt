WASHINGTON, D. U. Aug. 23.
i.iii vg viiiis was mure
tense today with the acknowledge
ment bv leaders of the brother-hands
that It is getting difficult to hold the
, men, who are demanding action In
consonance wun me stnxe vote wnicn
they took.. The negotiations with the
railroad operator are said to be pros
pective of so much delay that the uni
on leaders are finding the men rest
less as the day pass.
" Union men say that the railroads
are disposed to disregard the sacrifice
by the employes cf their demand for
.time and a half for overtime. '
The railroad ' operators, T on their
side, maintain that the Increased ex
oenaee Involved in aceeotlnn tha -Inht.
r.our day demanced by the men must
be met by increased charges, other
wise the roads will be forced into a
receivers nip. '
President Wilson, Chairman New-
lands of the senate interstate com
merce committee, and '. Chairman
Adams on of the house committee on
.Interstate and foreign commerce, con
ferred today on the strike situation.
.. A reply from the railroad men to the
statement of the president at the con
ference on Mondav la still awaited.
, Hale Holden, president of the Chi
cago, Burlington, Qaincy Railroad ;
Robert S. LovetL'head of the Harri
rnan system, and Daniel Willard, pres
ident of the Baltimore & Ohio Rail
road, held a' lengthy conference with
Mr. Wilson at the White House yes
terday.. It is understood that they dis
cussed general . conditions with the
president, going over some of the dif
ficulties in the way of granting the
demand for an eight-hour day and
ume ana a nair xor an overtime, maae
by the members of the brotherhoods.
Expect Nation to intervene.
While no authoritative statement
was Issued from the headquarters of
the railroad presidents, yesterday, it
is understood that they are disposed
to prolong the negotiations in the
hope that the business men of the na
tion will come to their support and
voice a strong opposition to the eight
hour day demand. . It was asserted
that it is this that is causing the an
swer to the president's proposal to
hang fire for so long, but it was also
asserted in some circles last night
that the reply cannot be delayed much
longer, and may be looked for within
a short time, possibly today.
The members of the railroad broth
erhood committee here issued a state
ment last night in which they asserted
that the plea for arbitration made by
the railroads is only a scheme to gain
time and to deceive the public.
The statement insists that the roads
have, on several questions and at dif
ferent times in the past, flatly re
fused to arbitrate, and that they are'
even now excluding negro firemen and
brakemen from the benefits of the ne
gotiations under way.
The statement also points out that
the demands of the men were known
in general to the officials some
months , ago, but they did nothing to
meet them until forced to do so.

Following a lengthy discussion and explanation of the additional work
the board of harbor commissioners at its meeting this afternoon approved
a bill of the Lord-Young , Engineerin g Company, contractors for the new

in building th retaining wall deeper through soft coral to a hard bottom
Chairman Charles R. Forbes rendered a report in wnlch he said the
total cost of the extra work will be about $21,600. Forbes stated that the
deeperJwall was necessary because at the 15-foot depth where It wac
thought the wall could rest, the outer' bench crumbled, and it was neces
sary to go deeper, until a bench could be formed of sufficient depth to car
ry the weight of the wall without undermining.
Rules and regulations of the board, over which the members have been
working for three years, have been printed and will be advertised shortly.

from German sources .was received
today: . .;- .
"BERLIN, Germany. Aug. 23'. De
tailed reports concerning the success
of German submarines are now at
hand and published.
"A German submarine on August 19
about 5 p. m. sighted five small Eng
lish cruisers steaming southeastward
accompanied by two flotillas of de-
recon-' stroyers behind which were six battle
cruisers strongly protected by destroy
ers.' The submarine succeeded in fir
ing a torpedo against one of the pro
tecting destroyers with four funnels,
apparently of the Mohawk type. A
short while after being hit the destroy
er sank with . its stem standing high
out of the water. :
-Immediately the whole English
squadron turned on its heels. The
submarine now attacked a small
cruiser running 25 miles, of the Chat
ham type, which was now stove be
hind. Two shots were fired, one into
the forecastle and the other the fire-
room. The snip immeaiaieiy snowea
a heavy list and stopped.
"The submarine on account of the
strong protection of the British
ships only about two and a half hours
later succeeded in repeating the at
tack azainst the cruiser, which was
now towed. Just before shooting, a
destroyer was noticed about 30O me
ters distant, which . ran toward the
submarine at extreme speed in order
to try to ram ft The submarine im
mediately plunged deep into the water
and heard a moment later a strong de
tonation above. Hostile destroyers un
til dark pursued the submarine, which
has now returned undamaged.
'The heavily damaged small cruiser
was destroyed later on. by another
German submarine."
Previous to this detailed report on
the attack of the German submarine,
Berlin in an official cablegram said
that the submarine was slightly dam
aged by the destroyer which tried to
ram ner, out aemea inai anoiaer sup
marine had been destroyed.
The German admiralty also denied
the report that a German fleet had
fled before the British fleet, declaring
that the German fleet was not in the .
