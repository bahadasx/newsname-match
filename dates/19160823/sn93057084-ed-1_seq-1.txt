ARE THEY "STRAINING AT A
GNAT?'
lieaders of The Press will re
member the criticism that we made
against the so-called '"Local Op
tion League" in our issue of Au
gust 9th. At the time, it did not
occur to us that the big advertis
ement that various papers have been
publishing for it. and which would
have been sent this paper had we
wanted to print it, was not strictly
t-uthful,—in other words, was not
a correct expression of the .senti
ment that it claimed. It is yet not
worth our while to go to the
trouble of trying to disprove, or
"object," to each and every state
ment made in the big adv.
But now comes the Onida
Watchman, of August 17, which
says that the name of the com
mitteeman for that county was in
serted in the adv. without the own
er's knowledge or consent. We
quote as follows what the Journal
says about it:
"In our last issue, in common with near
ly every other paper in South Dakota, we
published a large ad given us for publi
cation by the Local Option League. The
movement maj be all right, but it is our
belief that local option has served its pur
pose in drying up a great part of the state
and that the time is now ripe for state
wide prohibition. We were at one time in
favor of open saloons, bnt, the improved
conditions in all towns we know of since
they went dry has convinced us that- the
open saloon should be abolished, although
we still confess a liking for a foaming
stein of malted hops on a hot summer day.
Local option was the only method a few
years ago when "blind pigs" in every town
were openly allowed hut the state is now
so nearly dry that state-wide prohibition
is a matter of course and we further be
lieve that it is only a matter of a few
short years before the nation itself will
have abolished the legal sale of all dis
tilled liquors. Further in regard to the
local option ad which we published last
week, the writer's father informs us that
his name as county president was put on
wholly without his knowledge or consent
and that he must decline the honor as hp
is not interested in the local option one
way or another,"
The Pierre Capital-Journal of
August 17 gives us a second in
stance wherein the name of a coun
ty committeeman for the above
named association is being or was
used without the proper permis
sion. This party writes the fol
lowing letter for publication:
Miller, S.D.—The use of my name in
"Local Option" advertising now appear
ing in papers over the state as "agent for
Hand county," is without my consent or
authorization, and I have written the of
ficer# named in said advertisments, order
ing my name withdrawn therefrom.

An extra large delegation of
Cheyenne river and Standing Rock
Indians camped in Lovers Lane
over Sunday, departing Monday
morning for Lower Hrule reser
vation, to attend the annual Con
vocation of Niobrara Deanery.
Iiec. Dr. Ashley. also Rev. Thos.
J. Rouillard of Eggleston, Minn.,
joined them here, besides an num
ber of others. Over fifty families
were iu the party.
Regular church exercises would
have been held in camp, but the
rain prevented anything in this
line
taking
place, much to the dis­
appointment of Forest City's
church people
