ROME, Aug. 23. Strong
nemy positions on the western
lopes of the Tofana and Tra
renanzes valleys have been
captured by the Italians in a
resumption of lighting on the
Italian front, it was officially
announced today. The Austrians
suffered heavily.
LONDON, Aug. 23. A great
battle of nations with the troops of
nearly every European belligerent
involved is gradually developing in
the Balkans as the fighting along
the 150-mile front increases in'i
fury.
Turkey is sending re-enforcements
into Bulgaria, according to
an Athens dispatch today.
At least one division of Turkish
soldiers is en route to join the Bul
gars in the attack on the allied
lines, while another division will be
so placed as to threaten Roumania
should that country decide to enter
-the war on the side of the allies.
Austria will" 'te asked to send a
few detachments to the Greek bor
der'to join the Bulgars, Germans,
and Turks, in resisting the com
bined attacks of French, English,
Russians, Italians, Serbians, and
Montenegrins. In no engagement
of modern history have the armies
of so many nations been in clash
along one battle front.
ALLIES RE-ENFORCED.
Forced to yield' advanced positions un
der the first Bulgarian attacks, the al
lies have re-enforced their lines and are
strongly on the offensive In the Vardar
valley northwest of Balonlkl.
On the wings, the Bulgarians have
made further slight advances by reason
of their numerical superiority, but
Anglo-French artillery and the stubborn
resistance of the Berbs has considerably
ohecked the momentum of the 'advanc
ing enemy forces.
South of Dcmlr HIssar, the Bulgars
progressed four miles, taking small
Greek villages, but were abruptly halted
by allied artillery.
All press dispatches from Roumania
bear evidence of close censorship, but

affections of her motorman husband,
and declaring she will fight bitterly tho
Hult for (0,000 damages filed In tho Dis
trict Supreme Court against her. Miss
Edith DeGray today acknowledged ac
quaintance with Levi C. Cox.
Miss DeGray. when found In her
apartment In the Woodle.v. Mlntwood
place and Columbia road northwest,
told how she became acquainted with
Cox on a street car last Decembor. and
of having met him several times In
Lafayette Park. She said her meeting
with him began with a "mild flirtation."
but she disavowed any knowledge of
the fact that Cox was a married man.
'All my relations with Cox wem In
the nature of a business transaction."
she doclared today. "It is true that he
receivea money from me, but all tho
money i ever gn.ve mm, I loaned mm.
During tho atiuet car strike last win

"He has never been 'to call on me here
In the .apartment, and the only place

any trouble."
Miss DeGray said that her "winning,

of Cox Is "absolutely ridiculous."
"When I met Cox It never occurred
to me that anything like this trouble

"and that was only prompted by sym

NO CATHOLIC
PARTY. IS CRY
Vigorous Resentment Express
ed Over Charge That Feder
ation Is Partisan.
TOO BIG, SAYS GERMAN
St. Louis Official Declares In
fluence Must Be Cast to
Serve Holy Principles.
NEW YORK, Aug. 23.-Vlgorous re
sentment over Intimations that the
American Federation of Catholic Bode
ties, in convention here this week. Is
partisan, 'waa displayed today by both
laymen and members of the clergy who
are attending the meetings.
"We want no Catholic party." the
words of Bishop Hlckey, of Rochester,
were repeated frequently today.
After telling a crowded meeting of the
German Roman Catholic Central Vereln
that there were 16,000,000 Catholics In the
United States, which meant 3.000,000 vot
ers, who could wield a tremendous In
fluence. James F. Zlpf, of BU Louis,
president of the vereln, said:
"I do not contend now for a religious
party. We arc too big for partisanship
but our Influence should be cast where
It will best serve the holy principles for
which we stand."
Burst of Applause.
A burst of applause followed his dec
laration that there should bo no re
ligious party.
Bishop Joseph Schrambs, of Toledo,
chairman of the federation's committee
on resolutions, said today that tho state
ments contained In the resolutions con
cerning Mexico, represented no back
down from the antl-Wllson stand taken
by National Secretary Matre, In his re
port to the convention Monday.
A clash between Col. Patrick Henry
Callahan, of Louisville. Ky.. chairman
of the religious prejudice committee of
the Knights of Columbus, and" Joseph
Brennan.. or Boston. occurred during the
morning session today."
Callahan had praised tho non-Catho-lies
of , the country for their tolerance.
"Much has been made of the fact
that the Catholics form one-sixth of
the population of this country'," he
said. "I want to compliment the flve
slxtha for their tolerance. Catholics
nave been able to do more, to pro
gress farther, than in any Catholic
country."
After the chair had refused Brennan
permission to reply, and ho had
gained the floor by .vote of the fed
eration, he characterized Callahan's
remarks as "silly" and "ridiculous,"
and as "spreading soft soap."
Calls It Ridiculous.
"It Is the height of ridiculousness
to describe the road as smooth when
It Is rough," he said. "It Is nonsense
to talk of non-Catholics allowing
Catholics to do this or that. Catho
lics are American citizens, and havo
the same rights ns others."
He said In Massachusetts Catholics
maintain institutions at a cost of
$4,000,000 a year, and that this
amounts to a gift to the State.
"One purpose of this convention,"
Callahan said, "Is to disillusion the
minds of non-Catholics of the belief
that Catholics look only through the
eyes of the capitalists. It Is very
evident that there Is no Catholic una
nimity. I picked up a newspaper to
day which showed that Catholics
voted three different wnyB on the
Mexican question.
"The question of religious projudlce
Is more Important than the question
of the hyphenate. Unless It Is con
sidered and its Influences counteract
ed, religious prejudice will do more
damage to this country than any
thing else."
Brennan Not Elected.
Brennan, who made tho attack on
Colonel Callahan, was the only officer
who failed of re-olcctlon. The rest of
the board of officers, headed by John
Whalen, of New York, as president.
' iJIiem5er8n0f tna nominating committee
tiuiiucu, luuure 10 re-eieci urennan had
nothing to do with his speech this morn
Ing.
The convention voted to change the
name of the organization to the Catho-.
lie Federation of the United States and
to organize under the Boston plan, with
the diocese as the unit of organization,
rather than the Stato or county. This
plan will first be submitted to the
bishops of the United States.
Kansas City was chosen this after
noon as convention city for 1OT7.

cis T. Homer, of Baltimore, was sev

from the court'a decision, to the Court
of Appeals of tho District, and asked
the court to fix a supersedeas bond.
To this, objection was made on the
ground that not being a final order
there ought to be no appeal. "Counsel
for Mr. McLean, however. Insisted that
under the code, the right existed be
cause the order would change the effect
of the custody of property. Justice

longer. ,
One brotherhood leader said they
could be kept In line that long, and that
the lid might blow oft thereafter.
Tho brotherhood leaders found that a
large proportion of the men but not
nuite a majority are disgruntled at the
delay of the railway execuUves in com
ing to a decision. Annoyed by this de
lav and spurred on by the excessive
heat, many let It be known that they
did not desire to stay here longer.
'Ilia sentiment for allowing the broth
erhoods to arrange for a strike waa ao
strong as to be alarming to certain of
tne leaders. They counseled patience,
believing that matters will come to a
head in the next twenty-four to forty
eight hours. Their talk waa optimistic,
nnd occasional faint bursts of applause
grow stronger toward the close of the
session.
Takes First Step.
President Wilson today took the first
step toward paving the way for an
acceptance by the railroad's of bjs
proposition for a settlement of the
threatened railroad strike.
In oonference with Chairman New
lands of tho Senate Committee on In
terstate Commerce and Chairman
Adaroson of the House Committee, on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the
President discussed the possibility of ,
legislation concerning the creation
of his proposed commission to Inves
tigate the collateral Issues In the dis
pute. Although both Senator Newlands and
Judge Adamson Indicated on leaving
the White House that there waa no
immediate proapaot of any new leg
islation. It was admitted that tne
President urged action by the Senate
Committee on the bill passed six
months ago by the House increasing
the membership of the Interstate
Commerce Commission from seven to
nine commissioners.
The Importance of this request Of
the President's lies in Its possible ap
plication to the long-standing- claim of
the railroads that the Government
commission which ts authorized to
pass on the question of rates to be
charged by the railroads ought also
to be the body empowered to sit In
Judgment as arbitrators on the de
mands of the employes for higher
wages or shorter hours.
Whether the President has In mind
an extension of the powers of the In
terstate Commerce Commission In this
respeot could not be learned.
Only Want Assurances.
At the conference last night with
members of the special committee Of
railway executives who are drafting the
reply of the railroads to the President's
proposition, the President Is said to
havo been given to Infer that the roads
were prepared to yield provided they
could get some reasonable assurances
for the future.
Two proposals were advanced tenta.
tlvely by them tn this connection. On
the ono hand thev expressed to the
President tho belief that any commis
sion to be created to deal with the
cnllatoral Issues In tho present dispute
should be a permanent body similar tn
tho Canadian commission, and empow
ered to act as an arbitration board In
future disputes. The question of ex
tending the membership and powers of
tho Interstate Commerce Commission
arc also said to ha,ve ben discussed.
The President held himself In readi
ness all day to receive the formal reply
of the railroads, nnd. with the exception
of the engagement at 10 o'clock with
Senator Nowlands and Judge Adamson,
saw no ono. In Administration circles a
definite basis of settlement ts oxpected
to be reached within the next twonty
four hours.
Before a final agreement is reached,
it Is thought probable that the Presi
dent will orslile over n Joint meeting
of tho railroad representatives and tlte
brotherhood chairmen.
lh full number of railway presi
dents met at 11 o'clock to hear re
ports from the subcommittee of eight
and the committee of three who call
ed on the President last nlchu
