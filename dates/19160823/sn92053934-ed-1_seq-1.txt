THE WAR TODAY
Political derolopments in the
Balkans overshadow in interest
for the. moment even the impor
tant military operations in prog
ress there, but today's dispatches
throw little new litrlit on the sit
uation from either a political or
military standpoint.
In connection with Rumania's
attitndo the course of the Kussian
campaign in Bukowina close to
the Huinaiiian frontier is beinir
closelv watched. Latest advices
from Teutonic sources, however,
declare that the Russians are be
ing held up bv the Teutonic resist
ance, not only in the Carpathian
lighting, but along the entire front
to the 'north In Galicia and Yol
hynia. The allies now have a formid
able army on the Macedonian
front. So far, however, it is only
in the center, in the Vardar val
lev, that entente advances have
been scored. It seems not improh
able that this reuion. which offers
supcriar railroad facilities because
of the line running through it
from Saloniki to I'skup. has been
selected as the main avenue along
vthich the entente thrust is to he
made.
On the western front, along the
Sommo the British continue clos
ing jn on Thiepval and apparently
have Gitillemont almost within
their grip. South of the Somme
the French are now being forced
to iisrht hard for retention of the
trenches captured early this week
in the vicinity of Kstrees, and
I'aris reports today that the Ger
mans were able to gain a footing
in their former trenches.
The Italian artillery in the Go
rizia area is showing activity and
work of consolidating ground won
east and southeast of the captured
town is being completed. The
Italians have launched a new ag
gresshe movement in the Dolo
mites, the Alpine region on the far
northern front-
The Turks have attempted an
offensive along the Black sea
coast, but Petrograd reports they
were driven back with the aid of
the Russian Black sea tleet.
The Bulgarians have bent back
both winsrs oi the entente allies on
the Saloniki front where the
armies of at least seven nations
are in battle. In the center, how
ever, where the allies' main force
is being made at the entrance to
the great Vardar valley, I'aris re
ports important gains. The Serb
Jans have been the heaviest losers
and have been forced back on their
extreme left, about nve miles from
the Serbian-Greek fronlier.
On the western front the British
continue their efforts to surround
I lilcpval and report the capture of
10(1 jards of German trenches near
Mariinpulch.

General Allied Offensive
Against the Bulgarians
Seems Imminent.
RUSS NEAR RUMANIA
Future Attitudes of Greek
and Rumanian Govern
ments Give Concern.
Ivondon, Aug. 23, (2:15 a. m.) De
velopments in the Balkans take first
place this morning in the newspapers,
which display keen interest in the
landing of the Italian and Russian
troops at Saloniki, the possible actions
by the Greek and Rumanian govern
ments and dn the new Russian offen
sive in Bukowina.
Unofficial dispatches say the Rus
sians are pushing ahead with the great
est energy in Bukowina close , to the
Rumanian frontier and already have
gained "a very brilliant success.'-' The
Daily News sums up the Balkan situa
tion as follows:
"The imminent general offensive
against Bulgaria Is of great impor
tance. One of the first results of a
successful offensive by General Sarrail
would be a complete rupture of Ger
many's communications with the east
and the capitulation of Turkey.
"The situation in Greece where
Greek troops already actually are en
gaged in hard fighting with their tra
ditional enemies, the Bulgars, is rich
In possibilities. As to the intentions
of Rumania, we may be content to
draw upon the German press, which
says Rumania definitely has joined
hands with the entente and is pre
paring to give Russian troops passage
tffrohgh. her territory.- It is difficult to
conceive what motives the Germans
could have for circulating such a state
ment other than the belief that it is
true."
Deny Famine in Albania.
Berlin, Aug. 23 (By wireless to Say
ville) The Austro-Hungarian troops
in Albania have been reinforced re
cently, according to official informa
tion from Vienna given out today by
the Overseas News agency. This
statement was made to controvert a
report from French sources that Aus-
tro-Hungarian troops had been witn
drawn and that in consequence there
was a famine in Albania and wide
spread agitation.
Equally untrtie, it is said, are asser
tions that rebellions have broken out
in Montenegro.
WILSON TO SPEAK

Chicago, Aug. 23. Vance C. McCor

day and conferred with Senator Thom
as J. Walsh, manager of western head
quarters, and a number of the depart
ment and bureau chiefs.
Later Chairman McCormick met a
number of national committeemen and
state chairmen from a number of
western states. Among his callers
was A. W. Chajles, state chairman of
Illinois.
Chairman McCormick expressed
himself as well pleased with the re
ports received from the central and
western states.
"Mr. Hughes has undertaken an 1m-'
possible task when he tries to har
monize the standpat republican lead
ers with the progressives," said Chair
man McCormick. "It is like trying to
mix oil and water. Imagine the diffi
culty encountered when one attempts
to satisfy the progressives on one
hand and placate standpatters like
Smoot, Crane and Penrose. That is
exactly what Hughes is up against.
That is the weakness of the republi
can position in this campaign. I am
grateful I am not managing Mr.
Hughes' campaign."
Chairman McCormick said Presi
dent Wilson will speak in Chicago and
other cities in the central and western
states before the close of the cam
paign, although no dates have yet been
agreed upon.

SPORT DOCTOR SHOT BY
RYPATIEMEAR DEATH
Dr. W. B. Pomroy, a Davenport op
tometrist, was shot and perhaps fatally
wounded when he swung off of a
Fourth avenue car at the foot of
Fourth avenue, at 3 o'clock this aft
ernoon. James Poulas, a Greek, fired the
shot. Police waiting for a Rock Is
land Southern interurban to go to
Woodhull, were near at hand and ar
rested Poulas immediately.
Poulas does not deny the shooting.
He alleges revenge for a beating he
says Pomroy administered to him three
months ago. Poulas said that several
of his ribs had been broken when Dr.
Pomroy attacked him.
Dr. Pomroy was with his niece. She
got off the car first. Pomroy alighted
next.
Poulas, who was following him,
Jumped off the car, set his suitcase
down on the pavement, drew forth his
revolver and fired the shot.
Poulas then started running ea'st
on Fourth avenue. He turned south
at Fourth street and dashed to Third
avenue. When police caught up with
him he did not resist arrest. He reach
ed in his pocket and pulled out the
gun, handing it over to the officers.
Dr. Pomroy was taken to St. An
thony's hospital in the ambulance. Dr.
Joseph I)e Silva was summoned. Ex
act location of the bullet had not been
fixed at a late hour this afternoon. It
is probably located in his chest. The
bullet perforated the lung.
Dr. Pomroy has offices with Dr.
Berwald in the Schmidt building in
Davenport. He lives at 325 West
Second street. Dr. Tomroy said that
he had never had any trouble ' with

fled from their homes into
streets panic-stricken.
There was no material
damage.
Berlin Hears
Rumania Is
Yet onFence
Berlin, Aug. 23 (by wireless to Say
ville.) Rumania has not decided
whether she will enter the war, in the
opinion of a person characterized by
the Overseas News agency as "a dis
tinguished diplomatist especially con
versant with Rumanian affairs."
On being asked by the news agency
as to the present situation, he said:
"Rumania's attitude is due to her
geographical situation. The country
is virtually surrounded by belliger
ents. Since the beginning of the pres
ent conflagration the entente powers,
particularly Russia, have been ex
tremely active in Rumania. The coun
try is flooded with Russian agents and
spies of all description. The entente
uses money lavishly to bribe politi
cians and influence the press.
"At present Rumania is still unde
cided. She probably will not give up
her adroit policy of neutrality unless
she believes the really decisive turn
in the war has been reached. Mean
while trade relations between Ruma
nia and the central powers continue to
be normal and active."

Poulas. He said he and Dr. Berwald
took an X-ray picture of Poula3 neck
to determine whether there were any
broken bones. Dr. Pomroy told him
there were none broken. Poulas said
another doctor told him there were.
Apparently Poulas followed Pomroy
with the intention of shooting him and
then fleeing for he had his belongings
with him in the suit case.
Miss Lulu Pomroy, his niece, who
resides in Keithsburg. 111., and who
was being taken to the Rock Island
Southern station at the foot of Fourth
avenue by her uncle. Dr. Pomroy, at
the time of the shooting told the fol
lowing story to an Argus reporter at
St. Anthony's hospital.
'I had been visiting for several
days with my uncle. Dr. Pomroy In
Davenport, and was to return to my
home in Keithsburg, 111., this after
noon. We took a Bridge line car to
Rock Island and hoarded a Fourth ave
nue car at Twentieth street.
"When the car reached First street
I got off first, my uncle following. The
first thing I knew of the shooting was
when I heard the shot and turned
about, to see my uncle falling and the
stranger standing by him with a smok
ing revolver. We did not know of the
presence of this man Poulas until he
fired the shot. My uncle knows of no
reason why Poulas should have shot
him. He told me that some time ago
he and Dr. Berwald, his office partner,
took an X-ray picture of Poulos neck.
Poulos had told them that another
physician had taken an X-ray of his
neck and found it broken. My uncle
found that the member was not frac
tured in any manner and told him so."

Henry Dalziel, liberal member for
Kirkcaldy Burghs, in regard tc "peace
rumors" and the situation in the Bal

peace,' said Lord Robert. "There is
only one way in which overtures for
peace could be made and that is from
an enemy to the government of this
country. If any such overtures were
made the first thing we should do
would be to consult with our allies."
As to the Balkans Lord Robert said
the most Important factor consisted of
the operations from Saloniki. The al

OF MANAGERS
Peaceful Settlement of Rail
Issue Is Conceded by
Close Observers.
SUMMONS SENATORS
Presidents of Roads Visit
White House for Confer
ence With Executive. ,
Washington, Aug. 23, President
Wilson summoned Senators w
lands and Representative Adam
son, chairmen of the senate and
house committees, to the While
house this morning. It is under,
stood he planned to discuss with
them legislation on the railroad
strike sit nation. The president
plan for settlement of the railroad
dispute would create a commission
to investigate the working of the
cight-hour day and collateral Is
sues. President Wilson plans to see
Senator Aewlands and Represen
tative Adamsnn again, probably
late todaj and expects to receive
another call from the committee
of the railroad executives some
time before tomorrow.
There were many indications
that the railroad presidents were
considering the eight-hour day on
condition that some definite as
surance he given them that future
disputes he arbitrated.
President Holden of the Bur
lington said the meeting of the
presidents and managers held this
morning bad recessed until 6
o'clock. Meantime the special com
mittee of the presidents Is In ses
sion. Mr. Holden also states that
no conclusion had been reached.
Possibility of passing an eight
hour law for railroads was dis
cussed among several congres
sional leaders, but no definite pro
gram was evolved and It was un
derstood no action would be tak
en unless the president's efforts
failed.
After their conference with Presi
dent Wilson, Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson said they had
discussed the strike controversy gen
erally, but that no legislation to meet
the situation had been gone over spe
cifically. The bill adding two mem
bers to the interstate commerce com
mission which has already passed the
house and which will come before the
senate Friday was one of the meas
ures discussed.
Beyond saying they had approved
the president's course in handling the
railroad situation and that they were
ready to push any legislation needed,
Senator Newlands and Representative
Adamson would not discuss their con
ference. Permanent Commission Planned.
It was understood, however, that the
creation of a permanent commission to
investigate such controversies was one
of the subjects mentioned.
It was understood definitely today
that the railroad executives had de
cided to act as a unit in handling the
present situation.
The program of the executives, as
understood,, was to deal first with the
principle of arbitration and afterward
with the eight-hour day. If means can
be found for guaranteeing arbitration
in future disputes, at least some of
the railroad executives are understood
to favor acquiescence with the eight
hour day demand.
Three railroad presidents today re
ported to the committee which is try
ing to formulate an answer on behalf
of the roads to President Wilson's sug
gested plan for the demands of the
union brotherhoods the substance of
their conference with the president at
the White house last night. It is un
derstood the purpose of that visit was
to secure Wilson's specific ideas on
how the railroads are to reimburse
their treasuries for the many millions
additional expenses which would arise
out of acceeding to the president's
plan for an eight-hour wage basis.
The president's attitude on this sub
ject was not disclosed.
