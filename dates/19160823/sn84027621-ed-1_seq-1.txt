Washington, Aug. 23. Secretary
Lansing announced last night the
names of the American members of
the joint commission to undertake the
settlement of the differences between
the United States and Mexico. They
are Franklin K. Lane, secretary of the
interior, Judge George Gray of Wil

of New York city.
All of the commissioners have ac
cepted the appointments and arrange
ments for their meeting with the
Mexican commissioners wil be made
by Secretary Lansing and Eliseo Ar-?
redondo, Carranza's ambassador des
ignate. ,
The -only questio nto be decided on
now is where the sessions will be held.
The Mexicans are anxious that it be
some resort on the New Jersey coast.
Probably the first problem takert lip
will be the proposed withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico. It is
expected -that this will be agreed to
by the United States commissioners,
as General Funston has already rec
ommended it.
tl is regarded here as probable that
the withdrawal of General Pershing's
men will soon be followed by the re
call of the national guard from the

MAXWELL SMASHES
RECORDS IN THE WEST
Ray McNamara Makes New Time Be
tween -Spokane and Seattle,
Portland and Spokane
Ray F. McNamara, piloting a Max
well car, recently made some remark
able records on the western coast,
adding to the reputation this make
has established for all-around effi-
ciency.
He broke all speed records in a runptart on another hike Tuesday morn
rom Spokane to Seattle in a stock
Maxwell roadster. The elapsed time
for this run was eleven hours, fifty
five minutes. The Maxwell" bettered
he train schedule between . these
points by more than an hour and Tow
ered the former automobile record by
five hours. : ,
McNamara . averaged thirty-two
miles . an hour across the desert lands
of eastern Washington. He crossed
he dangerous Blewitt Pass in the
Wenatchee "mountains and the Sno-
qualmie Pass in the Cascades after
midnight, and arrived in Seattle early
in the morning: '
This record run was checked official
y by the newspapers of Spokane and
Washington.
Another record run for speed and
efficiency was hung. up- by McNa
mara on a -run from Portland to Spo
kane. The distance is 458 miles and
the elapsed time was fifteen hours and
thirty-one minutes. The best previous
record for this run was made last
May, when a motor car did the dis
tance in twenty hours and thirty min
utes. v;v.:. ;,.-, ,
McNamara attributes the success of
both runs to the quick acceleration,
perfect cooling system, excellent
brakes and the Maxwell's ability to
stand a good hard beating over a haz
ardous course. ,
During his tours in the west, the
Maxwell pijot has been gathering
some valuable road information for
the benefit of motorists. A recent trip
out of Portland carried him more than
1000 miles" over, deserts and through
the mountains. Rain and rough roads
followed the Maxwell through this
junket, but thetrip was made with
out a semblance of mechanical trou
ble.

A MUSICAL EVENING

Company-A
(Special Correspondence of the Star)
Black Point, Aug. 20. There was a
jolly time in Co. A's stret last night
as the boys danced to f the tune of
"Don't Hesitate, But Do It Now."
Max Tobleske, with his mandolin,
and Freeman with his guitar fur
nished music for the. dance..
There was much musical talent
shown when the boys sung "Fare
well," "Dear Old Girl," "I'm On My
Way to Mexico," "Down on the Rio
Grande," etc. , i
To. cheer things up the boys sang
for the grand finale, "I Know You are
Waiting," "In a Garland of Old Fash
ion Roses," "Beneath the Southern
Pines," "Down on the S'wanee River"
and "I'm Coming Back to You."
The Second Regiment went " out
Monday morning for a 22-mile hike,
intending to camp out at night and
return Tuesday evening, but owing to
the heavy rain that set in at 8:30 it
was decided to return to camp and
mg. rne boys returned to camp all
wet but in good spirits after making
eleven miles.

guards, was taken suddenly sick Sun

SCHNIEDER IS EXCITED
' Berlin bulletins are very brief but
but very significant these days. They
say, "Attacks on all front repulsed,"
and furnish indisputable evidence that
the Germans and their allies are on
the defensive. Star.
Yes, Mr. Editor Neutral of the
Ocala Star!
Its a defence, which holds France
from the , French, Russia from the
Russians, Italy from the Italians, Bel
gium from the Belgians .and what of
England? She is willing to sacrifice
the last Frenchman, Belgian, Russian
or Italian to save her bacon. .
And the defence holds. Germany
is not being devastated since October
1914. But for our peculiarly Ameri
can form of neutrality, this damnable
butchery could not halve lasted the
year 1914.
What is more, a genuinely, honest
neutrality on the part of the United
States could have prevented the holo
caust or at least could have confined
it to Austria and Serbia. For shame!
Our outrageous neutrality is likely to
prolong the slaughter, another year,
it's a highly profitable neutrality for
about two or three hundred Ameri
can plutes, but look out! "Chickens
are said to come home to roost," even
the present beneficiaries of our hy
pocrisy will despise us later for the
role we are playing now. C. F. S.
Strange that Comrade Schneider
can't see his own inconsistency. He
is an American citizen and as much
bound to be neutral as we are. On
the contrary, he has been much more
offensive in his denunciation of the
Allies than we have been of . Ger
many., we have, never tnea to con
ceal our sympathy for the Allies nor
expected Germans to conceal theirs
for their Fatherland. What we com
plain of is the approbation by some
German-Americans of the murder of
our own people by men wearing the
kaiser's uniform.

FARM MAKERS CLUBS
AMONG COLORED PEOPLE
According to the report of A. A.
Turner, manager club agent of the
Farm Makers' Clubs, Florida A. & M.
College, -Tallahassee, there are ovei
400 negro boys and girls in this and
other -counties over the state being
taught better farming by this system
of farm training afforded them by
the state, and federal aids.
Up to the present, seven counties
are getting the benefit of this oppor
tunity among negro youth. V Twenty
nine of the total number enrolled dur
ing the past season are working in
this county and getting good results
in their work. A much larger enroll
ment will be shown another year, as
the work was no more than introduced
the past year.
Information has been received that
champions in the corn, pig, poultry
and canning clubs, including the seven
counties, "will receive the following
prizes: A scholarship in the Florida
A. & M. College, for the corn winner;,
a thoroughbred Duroc-Jersey gilt for
the winner in the pig club (March
pig); a $30 canning outfit .will be
given the best tomato grower and
one-half dozen thoroughbred pullets
and cockerel will be awarded the
champion in the poultry clubt The
prizes, named will be considered as
state prizes; county prizes will als
be given for the winners in each of
the clubs mentioned for each county.
All prizes given will be based upon
the work done by each member as
shown by the reports they submit on
their work this fall as greatest yield,
cheapest cost of production, best
written report on their work, etc.'
Fifteen canning machines have been
purchased by the various schools
working in the seven counties which
has been the means of ." Jhundreds of
cans of fruit and vegetables being put
up that would have otherwise been
wasted.
The coming of farm makers' clubs
to the negro boys and girls in this
county will afford them better oppor
tunities in farming and enable them
to show progress along the line of
better farming and better living.

favorable , circumstances.
After more than a year's use of the

conditions because of questions re

(Associated Press)
Washington, Aug. 23 The brother
hood committeemen at a meeting this
morning showed such marked signs of
unrest at the delay in the negotiations
between President Wilson and the
railroad executives that the leaders
of the brotherhoods became alarmed
and expressed fears of .their ability to
hold the committeemen in check. The
brotherhood meeting was thrown into
an uproar by the demands of the
minority, who are demanding immed
iate action unless the railroads accept
the president's plan. The leadersad
journed the meeting before any vote
could be taken. Later they said they
could hold off the minority for a
while. The committeemen meet again
tomorrow. Some of them wanted to
go home today, and leave" the brother
hood heads with authority to call a
strike in case the railroads don't ac
cept the president's plan. One com
mitteeman charged the railroads with
playing with the president, as he said
they had played with the brotherhoods
for time.
v While the railroad executives con
tinued in conference among them
selves, President Wilson conf en ed
with Senator Newlands and Repre
sentative Adamson, chairmen of the
interstate commerce committees of
Congress, over the bill to add two
members to the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Senator Newlands said
he would push the bill. This is taken
to mean it is intended, if possible, to
refer the investigation features to the
commission.
EMPLOYERS ARE WAVERING
There were many indications this
afternoon that the railroad presidents
are considering the eight-hour day,
on condition that some definite assur
ance be given them by the brother
hoods that in future disputes will be
arbitrated. Chairman Holden of the
special railroad committee denied the
reports that a conclusion had already
been reached. -
A PHILADELPHIA LETTER
Editor Star: A stranger dropping
down into this village just now would
think that he had lost his reckoning
and that it was still July 4th, for all
public buildings, stores and private
dwellings whose owners are the proud
possessors of a piece of - national
bunting are still displaying the same
from their house tops or front
porches, while a great many teams
and carriagelTand even the pulpits in
thechurciies. many of which own
beautiful silk flags, have them placed
one on .each side of the preacher. By
a little investigation I find that they
were all brought out and the whole
city beautifully decorated in honor of
the soldier boys when they left a
short time - since for the Mexican
border, and the flags are still flying
that those boys may know they are
not forgotten. We think this quite a
pretty idea and commend it to the
Ocala friends of Co. A.
There are but three topics ;of con
versation that . are admissable here
just at present. The first of hese is
the weather and it certainly is a heat
ed subject at the presnt time. Of
course Florida crackers' think they
are qualified to speak on the subject
as far as -thermometers indicate but
we'uns never experience the kind of
article that is being handed out here
just now. In Florida it is hot, very
hot, at times, but it i3 out in the

a tree cr house it is invariably cool.

when the sun does not shine at all
and the humidity is thick enough to
cut with a dull knife, and the conse
quences of this i3 that the clang of

the ladder, he was struck by the heat
and pitched head first to the street
pavement. I find it a hard matter to
make people here believe that nothing
like that has ever happened in Flor
ida. A few days since I noticed by
the government report that it was
hotter in Philadelphia and Chicago
than 5 it was in Phoenix, Ariz., and,
that used to be called the warmest
place in the country and in the olden
times when it was only a fort, a sol
dier died, and his ghost had to come
back for his blankets, so you may
know it is some warm here just at
present.
Another rather general topic of
conversation is 'the war and strangers

company for as likely as not there
may be a wide difference between
their' convictions and ours, and while
a possible majority of the "people

little complaint to, make against what
it has. done for business, for in last
evening's paper I counted over five
solid columns of help wanted.
In speaking of the inconveniences
arising from the war some one pre
dicts a shortage of blue pencils on
account of not getting the dye stuff
from Germany. Now if there is, a
scarcity of pens because all steel
works are now making bullets, and
the paste pot material is sent to help
feed the Belgians, what are the poor
editors to do for tools.
Of course we hear considerable
baseball talk as the Philadelphia club
is now next to the top but the Brook
lyn team, which is No. 1, refuse to be
beaten and are keeping the Phillies
out of their proper place. A reporter
said that it was very foolish of some
one wasting their efforts in blowing
up ships and ammunition warehouses,
for if they would drop a few dynamite
bombs on the heads of the Brooklyn
club they might be doing some good
for this country. . H.'C. Packham.
