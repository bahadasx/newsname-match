WILSON CALLS CONGRESS
COMMITTEE FOR CONFERENCE
Marked Evidence of Uneasiness
Among the Heads of Different
Railways.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 23.There was
a marked evidence of uneasiness,
among the railway presidents here
today. The presidents still have no
solution to Wilson's proposition.
They are divided among themselves
and have been unable to agree upon
any proposition.
Some of the presidents are reported
as saying "let us accept Wilson's
proposition and let the result be on
Wilson's head."
Act Independently.
Unless a headway is made indica
tions are that some of the railways
may act independently and accept or
reject the proposals.
President Wilson called a confer
ence of Chairman Newlands and Ad
amson of the senate and house in
terstate commerce committees. The
purport of the meeting has not been
disclosed. It is considered probable
that it concerns legislation resulting
from the railway presidents' confer
ence held last night.
For More Members.
Following the conference, it be
came known that the president will
ask for immediate congressional con
sideration of a bill to increase mem
bership of the interstate commerce
commission. It is thought that this
is connected with the railways' ap
plication for an increased rate if
Wilson's plan is accepted.
There was strike talk among the
brotherhoods again today. Thomas
