ARE
To Hear Wilson's Plan for Legislation
to Settle the Railroad
Dispute.

Hill Decides.
( V ASSOCIATED POEItl
WASHINGTON, Auk. 23?President
Wilson Wednesday summoned
Senator Nowlands and Representative
Adamson, chairmen of the Senate
and House commerce committees,
to the White House It Is understood
he planned to discuss with
them legislation on the railroad
strike situation under the president's
plan for settlement of
the railroad dispute. Congress would
create a commission to Investigate
the working of the eight-hour day
and collateral issues.
The hie committee of brotherhood
representatives were impatient at
the delay but \V. 0. Lee, head of the
trainmen's brotherhood, expressed
the heliof that they would not bo
held here later than Thursday. A
statement issued by the employes'
committee charged the railroads
with inconsistency in contending
for arbitration, though refusing
to arbitrate demands
of employes on a number of
minor roads not repreesnted directly
In the present negotiations, but said
to be controlled by the larger lines.
Louis W. Hill, president of the j
Great Northern railway and one of
the strongest opponents of the
eight-hour day, declared In a state
-! itr?*v,..v
Jll'.'nt ^IVCIl OllL *V CUUCOUttjr l 11 (i i- i
many western railroads In particular
Would have scant earnings next year
and that many would be forced Into
receivership by an eight-hour wage
basis.
"This is a time when Instead of;
being burdened with useless and tin-'
called for expenses, such as are de-1
manded by the brotherhoods, the
railroads should receive every encouragement
in order to meet the'
lieedH of the country," he said.
"Such an extra burden as is contemplated
by this eight-hour demand .
would not only cut off all possibility
of dividends and extension but'
Ill 1U1V it it till] lit' I ui ntttttriii i (inroads
into receivership and cripple
their usefulness to the territory they
serve."
An employes' meeting Wednesday
morning was thrown into an uproar
by speeches of a minority, which demanded
immediate action unless the \
roads accept the president's plans, i
I but the leaders succeeding in adjourning
it before any vote could be
| taken on any of the various proposals.
They said afterward that
while the pressure for immediate action
came from a minority it was
strong, but they believed a majority
, 'would bo willing to give the president
a little more time. Some of
them urged that most of them go'
I home, leaving the brotherhood heads.
" Itb nutbrtrll.. null n ctrllro
Frequently shouts and applause 1
were heard a block away from tho
hall.
"It 1 sour belief," one of the com- i
lnltteemen said," that the railroads
are playing for time with the presl- i
dent Just as they hare done with us ,
lor many months. There is no rea-1
son why they should not have given 1
the president an answer by this time.
They are tiring us out all right and
the men arc getting disgusted with I
the whole situation. I think there
are enough cool-headed committee-!
men here to control the meeting n
day or two longer, but the discontent
1b spredlng rapidly." j

Speaking of the sale, which will
begin Thursday morning, an official
of the store said Wednesday; "Wej
are simply caught with the goods; |
Hint's all. We have been notified to
vacate, and vacate we must. Goods
that had been ordered for fall are
coming in every day, and the total
stock is worth more than H50.000.
It must be disposed of," and with an
air of confidence, he added: "It will
be disposed of,"
The store official called attention
to the fact that the Nusbaum store
Is the agnecy for at leats fifty standard
articles of clothing. "These
nrllMnct Jmve n ntnndnrri nrlco." he
said, "and are never sold below that
figure. In ordor to eiean our shelves
we are forced to sell these highgrade
articles at a sacrlflco."
It was oxplnlned that one of the
reasons for the stupendous sale was
the desire of the management to
stock the new store with new goods.
Mannle Nusbaum first opened for
business In Clarksburg In the year
187!). He has grown old with the
store In point of age, but more and
more progressive In spirit. His associates
are also * modern business
men.
! The new building will be one of
I the most modem store buildings In
this section of the state. There will

been dynamited.
Hennoghan, it Is said, stopped at
the "Keystone Camp" on the Ohio
side of the riv^r last week after attending
the local fair, The cause of
[ the drowning has not yet been established,
as the evidence polntB to two
theories, one of accidental drowning
and the other of suicide, The latter
seems to bear the more weight as
