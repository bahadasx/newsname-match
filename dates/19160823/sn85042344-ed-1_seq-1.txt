THK adoption of a resolution
charging that, government em

the feature of yesterday s session of
the Oklahoma State Fedciation of
Labor.
Tile fight over proposed amend
ments to the workmen's compensation
net, that threatens lo be the liveliest
sotumble of the entire convention, did
not break yesterday, although 22 del
egates presented a reso'.i'tion asking
for eertain amendments to the law
that are not in keeping with the rec
ommendations on this subject made
by Kdgar 8. Kenton, president of the
federation. This resolution was re
ferred to the proper committee and
will be reported oil today. Noses wore
counted yesterday and It was esti
muted that the convention was about,
evenly divided on the subject. The
resolution was offered by delegates
representing the bulldim? crafts, i Hher
delegates will stick by the legislative
piogTam pioposed by President 1 'en

A resolution was adopted yesterday
afternoon, instructing the legislative
lontmittee to work for an amendment
to the nine-hour law for women mak
ing the act applicable In all cities and
towns in tho state. At the present
time it docs not app'y to towns that
had a population of less than five
thousand according to the federal
census of 1910. In Drumright laun
dries, stores-and other establishments
are working employes more than nine
hours n day, and seven days a week,
and delegates from that city offered
the resolution.
The resolutions committee submit
ted only a partial report. The balance

Secretary-Treasurer Ollie S. Wil
son read a communication from the
state Industrial commission asking
the federation to instruct union
workers as to the proper method of
filing claims under the workmen's
compensation act
Among the resolutions Introduced
by delegates and referred to tho res
olutions committee was one endors
ing a universal eight-hour law for
all classes of labor in Oklahoma. It
is probable that this resolution will
bo tabled by the committee as such
a law would tie unconstitutional, In
the opinion of many delegates.
Another resolution asked the ap
proval of the convention of the ac
tion of tho Western Federation of
Miners In organizing the smelter
workers at llenryetta. There is a
strike on there at present and the
smelter owners claim that the Min
ers' federation has no Jurisdiction
over smelter workers. The resolu
tions ask I bat the Chamber of Com
merce at llenryetta be informed that
the State Federation of Labor is be
hind the action of the miners' or
ganization. Resolution Adopted.
The convention unanimously
adopted the report of the resolutions
committee in favor of the resolution
regarding Indian agencies. The reso
lution sets forth that "petty Indian
agents" have used the power of
their offices to discriminate against
organized labor in this state, and
directs ' the officers of the federa
tion to appeal to federal authorities
at Washington for relief from this
situation.
At the request of a delegate from
the painters' union of Oklahoma City,
the convention adopted a resolution
placing the Daily oklahonian. the
Oklahoma City Times and the Okla
homa 1 'armor-Stockman on the un
fair lit. Several delegates announced
that their locals had imposed a fine
of IS on each member caught read
ing any one t.f these publications,
The reason for the action, it was ex
plained, started with tho employing
cf nonunion painters on the Okla
iioii'an building and the refusal of
that niper to siirn a contract with the
prcsMnen s union. It was explained
that the boycott resolution would not
effect tho typographical and other
unions that now have contracts with
the Oklahoma Publishing company.

OKLAHOMA CITY. Aug. 22. A
concrete sladium which will cost
Kol.OOU will he erected on the state
fairgrounds to take the place of the
grandstand which was destroyed by
lire last night, according to announce
ment forthcoming today from mem
bers of tile board of directors. It is
the intention, too. to have this mas
sive structure in place when the fair
opens, September 23.
Ktforts also will be made to recon
struct the concessions building, al
though It is not a certainty they will
lie successful as this structure is of
such massive proportions that it is
feared it could not be finished in such
a short time. The scenic railway wi'l
not be rebuilt this year and a tem
porary structure will be erected for
the carousel.
The directors are convinced this fair
will tie quite as successful as those
which previously were held and the
big stadium, which will stvit ten thou
sand people, will be a great permanent
improvement to the grounds and will
be fireproof. Workmen were em
ployed early this morning to clear
away the debris of the burned build
ings and before tomorrow night this
task probably will be completed, after
which the building will begin and he
rushed to completion.

RESOLUTIONS GALORE

on Hack and Swap Bo
quets by the Hour.
WITH wheels well greased and
the muffler wide open, the old
Heardon-Fildes-tilasgow steam roller
bumped and caromed over the re
organization meeting of the Demo
cratic county central committee yes
terday and after only a temporary
stall the enemy was Ironed out and
Woodson K. Norvell named as chair
nwvn of the gr-r-r-eat and guiding
spirit of Tulsa county Democracy.
Norvell succeeds Judge II. P. Schaef
fer. retiring chairman.
The three-geared machine which
cent rolled the meeting began its
work as the chairman's gavel fell on
the d'"sl:. lleardon, Fildes and (fltis
Bow had enoi.gh members with them
to put over anything and everything
they wanted, and never was an of
fice or resolution In doubt that was
proposed by the crew of the old ma
chine. The successful men were the ones
who lost out at the time of the county
convention and who later called a
rump convention and elected a sec
ond scuad of delegates to go to Ok
lahoma City. At that time they were
turned down by the committee on
credentials and it was thought they
had been squelched for all lime, but
the comeback they engineered yes
terday bad the kick of an army mule.
They wantid Woodson Norvell to
pilot the old party ship and they put
hint over besides naming Denny
Jones as secretary. The opposition
headed by Joo Kenton and Kd Mar
shall then fled from the field and
left the meeting wholly In the hands
of Reardon et al. Several pockets
full of resolutions were adopted.
Looked ."0-.-0.
When the curtain first ascended it
appeared that the forces were about
evenly divided There were perhaps
IS or 20 of t'le 4fi members of the
committee present while the others
carried proxies.
Judge Charles F Fildes was very
promptly and properly named as
temporary chairman following an
eloquent review of his work in the
ranks of the party in the nominatin
speech made by M. K. (llasgow. Judge
Fildes returned the compliment later
when he Introduced one of his in
numerable resolutions which bound
the committee to use all of its power
to Bee that Glasgow was named to
take any office that might become va
cant in the state. He added that
Olasfc-ow was looking for Just such a
lot. The resolution was adepted, as
were all the others, which included
everything from the railing of the
n.eeting to the appointment of the
"sand-bagging" committee to gather
in the shekels for launching the
campaign.
Ed Marshall, armed with a proxy,
nearly started a riot when he arose
and asked that the ;j11 be called to
make sure that a quorum was pres
ent. Koardon, Fildes and Glasgow
were on their feet at once to inform
him that he was out of order and de
manded he resume his seat.
Glasgow gave vent to Ids feelings
in no uncertain terms and remarked
I hat he wouldn't "stand for none of
this here proxy business nohow."
Marshall was persistent and repeated,
fy demanded recognition from the
fhair but it never came until after
Nt rvell's name had been placed In
nomination.

Marshall finally waa permitted to
talk again but what he had to say had
the same effect as the dropping of a

The I'.ritlsh have made further ad

hundred yards of German trenches,
says a war office statement tonight.
Both allied wings on the Saloniki

center, however, where the allies'
main force is being made at the en
trance to the great Vardar valley,
Paris reports Important gains.
Nothing is said about the Russian or
Italian share in the fighting and no
Information has been given us to their
strength. The Serbians apparently
have been the heaviest losers and have
been forced hack on their extreme left
about five miles from the Serbian
Greek frontier. They claim, however,
continued progress on the other sec
tions of their front.
Are Forced Hack.
On the allied right the Hritlsh and
French who hud crossed the Struma
towards the Bulgarian frontier have
been forced back on the river.
On the western front there has been
little change. The British continue
their efforts to surround Thiepval and
report the rapture of one hundred
yards of German trenches in the di
rection of Martinpuich. There has
been no action of importance on the
French section.
For several days meager Russian re
ports have insisted that nothing of
importance has occurred in the east.
Berlin, however, describes very heavy
fighting both on the Stokhod and in
the Carpathians. An interesting fea
ture of the Russian official statement
is the intimation that the Grand Duke
Nicholas again is pressing his offen
sive in the Caucasus. For the last two
days I'etrograd has emphasized the
fighting around Diarbekr but no im
portant change has occurred.
London claims a heavy blow against
Germany on the sea. The British sub
marine K-23 reports having attacked
an 18,6(l-ton German battleship and
the submarine's commander believes
he sank it.
There is no news from the Italian
front where a lull has existed for sev

tonight that a definite answer to

Senator .Simmons, drib man of
the finance committee, auoniitting

an finance expert, asserting that the
Democratic parly should be convicted
of attempting' lo procure votes under
fa se pretenses, ecneral eii bate on tho
1211a, HUD, Oil!) emergency revenue bill
began today in the senate. There
were indications on every hand of a
partisan battle royal to be wageu for
I ev era I d lys.
Insisting that national di fense, pre
paredness and the Mexican situation
were altogether responsible for tho
loesi-iiv of speclil revenue legisla
tion and a proposed bond Issue, Seiia
torlor .Simmons declared Bcpubh. ans
In congress dad clamored for even
gteati i- expenuitiircs for .le'ense and
hitting done this, were seeking parti
san advantage by making false
charges of Democratic extravagance

Senator Snioot, opening the pepub.
Mean cssaiilt on the revenue bill anld
if the Democratic party were to lie re
tained in control of the KOernment
the country would "suffer an era of
uiieiiealled extravaganre combined
with inefficiency unsurpassed.'' His
attack was supported bv Senator Cur
tis who asserted that the burden ot
taxation should not be placed on tho
American people and that revenues
should be raised by a protective tar
iff. Offers Testimony.
To prove his contention that normul
appropriation of (his session are not
excessive, Senator Simmons submitted
treasury department estimates for the
year 1K17 showing that excluding
1'isla! appropriations bond Ismies al
lendy authorized and amounts that
will not be expended, revenue must be
provided for disbursements of 1,126, -24:',
duo. Of this amount the total
i pi roprlnllon for national defense
would aggregate about $454,000,000
and tho senator submitted other fig
ures ti prove that this extraordinary
amount, due to preparedness and the
Mfxlciin emergency exceeded normal
defense appropriations by about $37 2..
2X0,000. "This amount. ' said Senator
Simmons, "deducted from the total,
estimated dlshiirs'.'iiients for the fls
ca' year 1917, would leave 1753. t3. 000
as the amount required to meet the
total normal disbursements for ihat
year. Now the total estimated receipts
for the yea r 1 SI 7 under existing laws is
(762,000,000 or 11 0:17, 000 more than
the estimated normal disbursements,
making it elear that h.it loi the ox-
II aordin.iry Irirreas' in the approprla.

pciiient and neeessirv, the normal re
ceipts would be-sufficient to pay the
expenses of the government for the
year and leave a surplus cf ov"

reielpts for the year 191S (before wo
entered thin preparednss program
and before the Mexican situation de
veloped) actually iebied A .-ulflclent
revenue lo pay the expenses of the
government ami left a surplus in the
treasury of t '",2 ."0,000."
Subtracting from the estimated dis
bursements the estimated receipts for

ance to be provided for is $3tl4.243,
t'no. To meet this amount he sub
mitted that the pending bill would
raise $20.'i.OOO.UOO ; the bond issue
$130. Ouo. 000, leaving a balance of
$211,24.1. 000 to be taken care of by
the general fund of the treasury,
which he said amounted to $1.14,327,
HDf on August 111 last.
Leferring to the proposed $130.
OOii.noo bond issue for Mexican ex
penditures, Senator Simmons said
Panama bonds could be used to re
imburse the treasury and added that
up to this time the Democratic party
had issued no Panama canal bunds,
whereas the Ilepublicans during the
Ito iscvelt and Taft administrations
sold $1.14,000,000 woith.
Didn't Keep Pledges.
Si nator Smoot asserted that the
Democratic parly had not kept the
pledges of retrenchment and economy,
and charged it with "wasteful and
useless expenditures too long for
enumeration."
"It we could bring tho Democratic
parly into a court of justice and In
diet and try that paity under the
rules of law," said the t'tah senator,'
the evidence that could be submitted
Would be more than adcpiate to con
vict it of procuring votes under fal.-
pretences.
"1'iitoi tun ately we can have no trial
tindei the tales of law, tiut which 13
undoubtedly betf, r, we shall have a
tn.il before the great tribunal of the
Alio ru in people whose verdict will
bo given as impartially as ever was
ec u by a juiy of 12 g 1 men and
tr ie, we shall know on the eighth of
November whether in the opinion of
the jury of Juries, the Democratic
party has kept its economy pledge in
oit'ice as zealously as it relied upon
that pledge during ihe campa'un."
Just before adjournment Senator
Pel. tose introduced a resolution to re
commit the revenue bill to the finance
committee with instructions that it be
lieiiid'd to raise an equitable portion
I' i".iii.ed revenue from the protee
ti'.e tariff. No action was taken ott
