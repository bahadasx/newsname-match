The ground on beyond where the
South Carolina regiments are en?
camped to a slightly northwosternly
direction aad on the same aide of the
railroad track, will be occupied by the
National Guardsmen from Georgia and
North Carolina, which, with the South
Carolina and Florida regiments, com?
prise the tth division. Immediately to
the , left of this ground and on the
opposite side of the railroad track lies
the Pennsylvania division, undor
Mai. Gen. Clements. This division
takes up two miles of ground.
The Palmetto boys are encamped it
the water pumping station, where all
the water for El Paso, Fort Bliss and
the country around here Is obtained.
The pumping station is in charge of
a Mr. Bethea. a native of South Caro?
lina, and a member of the Bethea
family of the Pee Dee section of1 the
Stats. Several of the men have al?
ready become acquainted with Mr.
Bethea.
?'eat to the left of the camp lies a
range of htlto, which are called moun?
tains in this country. This range of
hills lies somewhat diagonally to the
Mexican border. They are bare of veg?
etation except for sage brush and cac?
tus In the ravines. Some of the South
Carolinians have already climbed to
the top of this range of hills, whfch
are about eight miles from camp. It
1? In these hills that rattlesnakes and
the other reptiles reside. On Sunday
First Sergt- Hughes, of the Smyth Ri?
lle?, of Pelxer, climbed the hills und
brought back into camp a Diamond
Mexican rattler. This snake in about
fifteen inches long, and the one he
captured had a button and two rattles.
Indicating that it whs 4 years old.
No snakes have yet been seen in
oamp. but there are plenty of horned
toads, centipedes and an abundance of
ants. The bother from this source,
however. Is Insignificant no far and
nothing like one would expect from
the stories heard before coming here.

The Smyth Rifles, of Pelser, went on
a hike this morning towards the
mountains. They were gjne about
two hours.
Several train loads of cattle and
sheep have been passing by the camp
from El Paso. Th * cars are all double -

mense load.
While a detail from the Butler
Guards, under Lieut. Shearer, was un?
loading some wood Sunday afternoon
a prairie dog dropped out of the load
and was caught after a chase over
camp. Several Jack rabbits have also
been caught in camp. Sunday while
the machine gun company of the 2d
was scrubbing off the cactus and sage
brush they jumped a rabbit and some
of the men caught it.
There has been a suggestion that
the folk back: home might like some
of the horned toads, and if they can
' be shipped by parcel post it is likely
that several will be sent bac* to Caro?

,turn them loose and they will imagine
that they are again among the cactus

TILLMAN TO ATTACK HUGHES.
Senior Senator From South Carolina
Expected to Answer Former Jus?
tice's Speech.
Washington, Aug. 18.?It is under?
stood here today that tomorrow, just
before he leaves for South Carolina,
having Completed his work with the
naval appropriation hill, Senator Tin?
man will address the senate In de?
fense of the South, with special ref?
erence to the recent speech of Charles
Evans Hughes In-which the latter de?
clared that sectionalism was rampant
In congress and that only Southern
members could secure important com?
mittee chairmanships. This speech
has angered congressmen who like to
see the political game played fairly
moro than anything else that has
happened in a long time.
When it was first announced that
Mr. Huhges had said that the South
was hogging everything worth having
in congress, many of the congres?
sional leaders believed that he had
been misquoted. Now, however, since
it has become apparent that no mis?
take was made, he is being shown
up as either having been grossly
misinformed or as being willing wil?
fully to pervert the real facts. Today
In tho house, Congressman Frank
Clarke of Florida said there was not
a word of truth to this sectionalism is?
sue. Tomorrow Senator Tillman Is
expected to put on the finishing
touches.

Views of Governor Manning and Ex

cative of Rest of State.
J. E. McLauchlin in Special to Wil?
mington Star.
Wadesboro, N. C, Aug 19.?The
writer, together with some 200 An
sonians gratified a curiosity to see
and hear South Carolina candidates
for State office:? in their marathon. We
left here in relays, a part going for the
all day performance and others only
for the afternoon, ariving in Chester?
field, where the big three-ring circus,
with numerous side shows, was stag?
ed for the day. Of course the main
attraction was to get a first hand im?
pression of the wonderful Cole I* j
Blease and ascertain the cause of his >
magnetism over South Carolina voters.
It matters not who receives the
nomination for governor of our neigh?
bor commonwealth, every one who
heard Blease speak Thursday will
have to concede that he is a campaign
speaker, par excellent. I doubt if
there is a superior in the United
Stt tes. He possesses the art of
knowing just how to present his side
of an argument in its most forceful
effect. He is chrewd and cunning. He
can take a mole hill and fashion It
Into a mountain, giving just enough
truth to undermine the confidence of
the susceptible. /
If the result of the primajry to be
held on August 29th should be judged
solely by the audience, exclusive of
those Imported from o'ther counties,
that assembled in Chesterfield, my
guess would be Manning by a safe ma?
jority over his four opponents.
The day's entertainment began with
performances by the sideshows, not
omitting the usual South Carolina,fis?
ticuff, and to do justice to the citi?
zens of Chesterfield county, the one
Jpraonal_ encounter wjl^ J^oclpi tated
by a citizen of another county and was
genuinely regretted by the Chesterfield
people.
After consuming two and a half
hours with speeches by candidates for
secretary, treasurer, lieutenant gov?
ernor, railroad commissioner, the main
entertainment of the day began at 1
o'clock. J. M. DesChamps was the
first of the aspirants for the office of
governor to be introduced. He is a
chautauqua speaker of parts. Next
came John T. Duncan, the chronic
candidate for State office, and then
the main attraction was staged.
Gov. R. I. Manning was introduced.
The audience gave him a round of ap?
plause that seemed to indicate that
three-fourths of the assembly endors?
ed his administration. His speech was
a rehearsal of the constructive work
accomplished during his administra?
tion. He dwelt especially upon the
'improvements made in the State Hos?
pital for Insane, his efforts to enforce
law and measures taken to establish
economy in the administration of the
State's affairs. He gave a good ac?
count of himself and the audience ap?
peared to appreciate the force of his
arguments. At the conclusion of his
speech, he was presented with a bou?
quet of flowers, which he most grace?
fully accepted, stating these flowers
are the emblems of purity fittingly
symbolizing his efforts to purify the
administration o:' his State.
Next in order was ex-Governor Cole
j L*. Blease. He was calm in his de?
meanor, earnest in his appeal and
forcefully attacked the acts of the
present governor.
Mr. Bleasc's speech was devoid of
sensations. In his usual manner he
painted the acts of the governor in
blackest of black paint. Asserting that
prohibition did not prohibit and made
a challenge to pay the expenses of
(any one who would go to any of the
leading Hotels of Charleston and Co?
lumbia if they would call for liquor or
beer and fail to get it. He did not
tell the audience that as a citizen of
South Carolina it was his duty to put
these facts before the proper authori?
ties if he had proof to convict. He ac?
cused the governor of communting
death sentences of vile criminals to
I life imprisonment and of playing fa
Ivorltes In making appointments to
! public office. The nearest thing bor
Iderlng on a sensation was his accusa?
tion that the governor was guilty of a
misdemeanor when he paid the salary
of a superintendent of the State asy?
lum, asserting that this act was con?
trary to the constitution of the State
anil punishable by a tine or imprison?
ment, and wound up his speech by
promising to pardon the governor
when he was convicted of this crime.

"He deser.es to be our next gov?
ernor and I feel that Darlington and
the Pee Dee section will do their
part to reelect him," said David R.
Coker of Hartsville yesterday, in dis?
cussing the prospeot8 for the reelec?
tion of Gov. Manning. "Many who
voted for other candidates two years
ago feel that they should show their
approval of Gov. Manning's adminis?
tration and their gratitude tc him
for his progressive, humane and bus?
iness-like course as governor."
Mr. Coker two years ago gave his
support to Mr. Cooper in order to de?
feat Mr. Richards. The work of Mr.
Coker at that time was largely re?
sponsible for the large vote polled by
Mr. Cooper In the Pee Dee section.
He speaks enthusiastically at this
time in reference to the reelection of
Gov. Manning. His statement to the
press follows in full:
"After talking with many repre?
sentative men during the last ten
I days, I am convinced that Richard I
Manning will get a big vote from
Darlington county in the first pri?
mary?possibly a majority of the
total vote. Many who voted for other
candidates two years ago feel that
they ought to show their approval of
Mr. Manning's administration and
their gratitude for his progressive,
humane and business-like course as
governor.
"Mr. Manning not only promised
to check blind tigerism, race track
gambling and general lawlessness, but
[has demonstrated his ability to do
'so. He not only deplored the lack
iof law enforcement and the contempt
for law which was prevalent, but has
shown that he can enforce the Ige/
and command respect for it. He not
only expressed his sympathy for the
^anfej^tinate IriMMte bur~rias redrlflSn
iaed the institution for their care and
placed it on a par with the best of
Its kind. His administration has
been efficient, economical and clean.
He deserves to be our next governor
and I feel that Darlington county
and the Pee Dee section will do their
part to reelect him."
Mr. Coker is a business man and
farmer of large acquaintance
[throughout the State, and any state?
ment he makes on the political situa?
tion carries considerable weight.
