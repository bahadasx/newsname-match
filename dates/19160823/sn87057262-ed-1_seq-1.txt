[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
RENO, Nev., Aug. 23.—Charles
Evans Hughes campaigned today In
the first acknowledgedly democratic
atate he has encountered since he left
Bridgehampton, N. Y., three weeks
ago to begin his long "swing around
the circle." He started his invasion
with an assault on the democratic
tariff and foreign policies here today,
adding also a defense of his own
labor record. Big crowds of Nevadi
ans greeted the republican presiden
tial nominee everywhere.
Today, however, Hughes started an
active rebellion. Never again will he
permit local or state committees to
put him through such a course of
strenuosity in campaigning as that
which he underwent yesterday. The
republican candidate admitted that he
Is very nearly tired out. Those with
whom he talked before his train
reached here said he.told them that
the spirit was willing, but that no
human being could stand many more
days of the sort he-has been-under
going during the past week. The glad
dest man in the United States will
be Charles Bvans Hughes when Aug
ust 27 rolls around and he and Mrs.
Evans can settle down for three days
rest at Estes Park, Colorado. There
the governor expects to sleep and eat
and get out in the air all he'can.
His weariness was plainly discernible
today in a husky voice that did queer
tricks of inflection when he sought to
press it to renewed vigor, but never
theless he had enviable enthusiasm
that enlivened him when be faced an
audience. Two or three tlmea during
the past few days Hughes has not
been able, because of pressure of de
mands made upon him by local and
state arrangements committees to get
his dinner before late at night. He
was scheduled yesterday to make
fourteen speeches, but at least eight
were added at the last moment. The
nominee has ruled that he will not
disappoint a crowd when they be
siege his private car and this very
Willingness led the local committees
to Impose on him.
Hughes apparently talks with great
facility—but It is a facility which he
has acquired only through a long
period of preparation. Colonel Roose
velt whose transcontinental trip of
four years ago Is really surpassed In
strenuosity by Hughes, has a faculty
for quick concentration ai*d little
preparation, but Hughes' service on
the bench and the painstaking legal
mint! with which he

equipped,
force him to study long and arduously
in mapping out his talks—even the
smallest ones.
His present trip, therefore, is even
harder on the candidate than his
schedule indicates, because so little
time is granted him for preparation.

It was pointed out that such action

WASHINGTON, Aag. t».—Strike
talk broke out again among the rail
road brotherhood men here today.
Thomas Donovan, the Boston and Al

ing session that the brotherhood
chairmen return to their homes, leav
ing the four heads here to arrange a
strike. His effort, however, was
crushed.
For a time it appeared as though
the sentiment for quick action might
not be checked. There were many
speeches. Brotherhood heads, seeing
the trend of the session, came to the
fore and spoke against such a drastlo
course. Finally, through parliamen
tary maneuvering, Donovan's plan
was killed, without being made into
a formal motion or coming to any
vote.
The strike threat was so strong
that It was plainly indicated after
ward the leaders might not be able
to check the men more than forty
eight, hours longer. One brotherhood
leader said they could be kept in line
that long, but that the 119 might blow
