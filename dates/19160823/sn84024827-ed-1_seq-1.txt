COMMISSION

Secretary Lansing Makes Pub
lic the Personnel of Board
Which Will Meet Similar
Body From Mexico.
JUDGE GRAY AND MR.
MOTT ARE TWO MEN
First Question To Be Consid
ered Will Be Withdrawal of
American Punitive Expedi
tion From Mexico.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON', Aug. 22. Secreta
ry Lansing announced tonight that the
American members of the joint com
mission to undertake settlement of
differences between the United States
and Mexico would be Franklin K.
Lane, secretary of the interior: Judge
George. Gray of Wilmington. Del., and
Dr. John R. Mott of New York City.
All of the commissioners have ac
cepted their appointments, the Mex
ican members were named some time
ago and arrangements for their meet
Secreeary Lansing and Eliseo Arre
dondo. General Carranza's ambassa
dor designate. Virtually the only
question to be decided is where the
sessions shall be held The Mexicans
are understood to prefer some resort
on the New Jersey coast.
Secretary Lane who will head the
Americcn group, was tl.o first mem
ber selected. Associate Justice Bran
deis was President Wilson's second
frhoice, but after a conference with
Chief Justice White he decided his
duties would not permit him to serve.
Judge Gray, a retired federal circuit
judge, and a former United States sen
ator, has had much experience on in
ternational bodies, and since 1900 he
has been a member of the internation
al permanent court of arbitration un
der the Hague convention. Dr. Mott
is general secretary of the interna
tional committee of the Young Men's
Christian Association, and author of
numerous religious works.
The Mexican commissioners are
Luis Cabrera, minister of finance;
Ygnacio Bonillas and Alberto Pani.
Both of the latter are engineers, and
Eonillas 3 a graduate of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
Probably t.'ie first problem taken up
ty the joint commission will be the
proposed withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico, as suggested by
General Carranza in his original note
proposing the commission. As Gen
eral Funston has recommended the re
call of General Perishing's expendi
tion this is expected to be agreed to
by the American commissioners.
General Carranza appointed his
commissioner "preferably to discuss
this question, the proctocol covering
the crossing of the international
border in pursuit cf bandits, and in
might have been behind the raids into
American territory. The United
States refused to limit the discussion
to these subjects and others undoubt
edly will be gone into. It has been
suggested that out of the discussion
of economic conditions in Mexico
might come assurances that would
make it poss'ble for American finan
cial and commercial interests to of
fer aid in the rehabilitation of the re
public. It is regarded as probable here that
withdrawal of the Pershing expedition
would be followed soon by the recall
of t.'ie National Guard from the border.
Some high officers of the army believe
that with Pershing's men added to the
border patrol, and the Additional men
provided under the new army bill.
General Funston would have a suf
ficient force of regulars to adequately
protect the border.

CATHOLIC VOTE
IS PLEDGED
TO PEACE
Roman Catholic Verein Urged
to Vote for "High and Holy
Frinciples"' at the Polls
Deny Interest in Mexico.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Aug. 22. Cath'olic
voters throughout the United States
were urged at a mass meeting of the
Roman Catholic Verein here tonight
to unite and cast their influences at
the polls "where it will subserve the
high and holy principles.'' for which
Catholics stand. James X. Zipf, pres
ident of the Gonzaga Unl'jn of St.
Louis, who made the appeal, declared
there were at least 3.000,000 Catholic
voters in the country "quite a force,"
he said, "for the bringing about of
proper conditions."
"That," Mr. Zipf added, "is aln.'jst
as many as the Republican party
polled at the last general election.
That very number places in our hands
a power to be used in works of social
civic betterment, in works of mercy
and of peace. When the Catholic arm
is uplifted let it be for construct.'jn
always, but never for destruction."
Mr. Zipf asserted he was not con
tending for a religious party, but for
an organization of Catholics to bring
infj public life a spirit of liberty and
toleration, "we must be so organized."
he said, "and under such leadership,
that upon occasions we speak for
liberty as one man and say that the
black hand of religious intoleration.
hypocrisy and hatred, 'th'ju shalt not
enter here, so far shalt thou go and
no farther.' "
A resolution demanding that at the
end of the world war the Pope "be
heard in the council of the nations
l'jr the securing and cementiug of a
permanent peace," was passed by the
American federation of Catholic socie
ties at its convention. It said:
"As the representative of the Prince
of Peace and as the common spiritual
father of so many millions among all
nations of the earth, he is the logical
arbitrator whom warring peoples can
turn for disinterested and impartial
settlement of all their differences in
accordance with the sacred principles
of justice and humanity."
A resolution was adopted, "inviting
thoughtful attention" to a statement
reirardinz the "attitude of American
Catholics toward their co-religionists
in this country and toward their co
religionists in Mexico. "The state
ment embodied in the resolution de
clared that at no time since "the be
ginning of the sad outrages against
religion in Mexico." has the Church
or any official body or leader affiliated
with the Church "lent aid, financial
or otherwise" to the stirring up of
strife, either here r elsewhere,
against any person or group claiming
to be a government or even a faction
in Mexico.
At no time, it was asserted, have
the exiled Mexican nrelates appealed
to their fellow Catholicc in the United
state., "to aid In revolutionary move
ments or to agitate for bringing about
American intervention." The only
money raised by Catholics in this
country to aid Mexico, it was added,
"was raised and expended for charit
able purp'oses."
"What Catholics of the United
States ask in connection with Mexico,"
declared the resolution, "is that what
ever form of government be establish
ed in Mexico with the aid and friend
ship of our country, it shall grant and
guarantee liberty of conscience and
freedom of worship as they exist In
our United States and which are de
nied in Mexico by unjust laws."
A resolution passed by the Catholic
Young Men's National Union today
called upon members "to act as a unit
In taking up preparedness" and urged
them to communicate with representa
tives in Congress "in the effort to
bring about real preparedness."

(By Review Leased Wire)
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 22. Charles
E. Hughes, before an audience in the
armory here tonight, declared for an
adequate federal compensation law
providing compensation to persons in
jured in hazardous employments, en
gaged in interstate commerce.
Mr. Hughes also spoke of labor
legislation enacted under Republican
administration.
"I rejoice in what has been done
under Republican auspices in the
labor sphere, in that department
which under our constitution is sub
ject to federal legislation." he said.
"It was under Republican admin
istration that the safety appliance act
was passed, a great safeguard of
safety of railroad employes. It was
under Republican administrate that
that act was passed by Congress so
as to give a far wider degree of pro
tection to safety appliances of various
sorts than were formerly accorded.
"It was under Republican admin
istration that Congress passed the
hours of service act in order to pre
vent the undue exhaustation of em
ployes through hours of labor which
were excessive. It was under Repub
lican administration that the employ
er's liability act of 1906 was passed.
"We have had a remarkable record
of achievement in the interests of fair
legislation under Republican auspices.
1 desire to see legislation of that
character and every reasonable sort
for the protection Of labor enacted,
to the end that there may be a feeling
through this country that justice is
being done.
"And I desire to see our wasteful
system of negligent action replaced
by proper compensation laws. That
should be achieved in many states.
The bill before Congress deals only
with government employes. In my
judgment there lias been an adequate
compensation act dealing with sub
ject to the supervision of Congress, in
such hazardous employment in inter
state commerce.
"It makes a great difference wheth
er half. Or less or more large shares
of the recoveries got for attorney
fees; it makes a great difference
whether our courts are crowded with
negligence suits with the uncertain
results: according to the manner in
which evidence as to the ordinary in
justice is developed. One man suc
ceeds and another man fails. Accident
and the risks Of accident in hazardous
employment, are certain; they are in
evitable; they should be dealt with
as risks of employment, under intel
ligent compensation laws.
"It is not more poetry or rapsody to
speak of the ideals of the human
brotherhood. Unless we have in this
country the spirit of true fellowship,
unless the man with investments
looks upon the man working with his
hands as a human being entitled to
decent, proper conditions of living
and to a fair share of the wOrk that
is done for the profitable results of
that work: unless the man who is
toiling recognizes the importance of
successful production and Of able
management; unless throughout all
is the spirit of cooperation, because
we are fellow workmen in our differ
ent activities, working justly and
'honestly, the United States cas never

prosperity.

SENATOR SIMMONS
MAKES DEFENSE
Bill to Provide the Grease for
Running Country Under
Discussion G. O. P. Makes
Political Powder Out of It
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. With
Sentor Simmons, chairman of the
finance committee, submitting figures
designe dto disprove Republican
charges of Democratic extravagance
and Senator Smoot, Republican finan
cial expert, asserting that the Demo
cratic party should be convicted of at
tempting to procure votes under false
pretenses, general debate on the
$205,000,000 emergency revenue bill
began today in the Senate. There
wer eindications on every hand of a
partisan battle royal to be waged for
several days.
Insisting that national defense pre
paredness and the Mexican situation
were altogether responsible for the
necessity of special revenue legisla
tion and a proposed bon dissue. Sen
ator Simmons declared Repubiclans
in Congress had clamored for even
greater expeditures for defense, and
having done this, were seeking parti
san advantage by making false
charges of Democratic extravagance
to the public.
Senator Smoot. opening the Repub
lican assault on the revenue bill, said
If the Democratic party were to be
retained in control of the government,
the country would "suffer an era of
unequalled extravagance combined
with inefficiency, unsurpassed." His
attack was supported by Senator
Curtis.
To prove Jiis contentions that nor
ma lappropriations of this session,
are not excessive. Senator Simmons
submitted treasury department esti
mates for the year 1917, showing that
excluding postal appropriations, bond
issues already authorized and amounts
that will not be expected, revenues
must be provided for disbursements of
$1,126,234,000. Of th:s amount the to
tal appropriation for national defense
would aggregate about $654,000,000
and the Senator submitted other fig
ures to prove that this extraodinary
amount due to preparedness and the
Mexican emergency, exceeded normal
defense appropriations by about $372,
2S0.000. "This amount," said Senator Sim
mons, "deducted from the total esti
mated disbursements for the fiscal
year 1917 would leave $753,963,000 as
the amount required to meet the total
normal disbursements of the govern
ment for that year. Now the total
estimated receipts for the rear ending
June 30 under existing laws is $768,
000,000. making it clear that but for
the extraordinary increase in the ap
propriation for the naval and military
establishment which have been
thought expedient and necessary, the
normal receipts would be sufficient to
pay the expenses of the government
for the year and leave a surplus of
over $8,000,000 in the treasury, just
as the receipts for the year 1916 (be
fore we entered upon this prepared
ness program and before the Mexican
situation developed) actually yielded
a sufficient revenue to pay the ex
penses of the government and left a
surplus in the treasury of $55,270,000."
Subtracting from the estimated dis
bursements the estimated receipt for
1917, the senator showed that the bal
ance to be provided as $364,243,000.
To meet this amount he submitted
that the pending bill would raisp $205.

Former First Lord of the Ad
miralty Urges England To
Prepare for .Much More
War Activity at Front
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. Aug. 22 On the presen
tation of the motion today for the ad
journment of the House of Commons
for the summer vacation. Colonel
Winston Spencer Churchill, formerly
first lord of the admiralty, initiated a
debate on the conduct of the war. He
said there was no certainty of a
speedy ending of the conflict. German
armies were more numerous and bet
ter equipped than ever, but what re
serves they had was another matter.
Colonel Churchill urged the country
to organize for a long war and to put
food supplies and prices on a -war bas
is. He also recommended the char
tering of all shipping at admiralty
rates to end the rise in freights which
be called a national scandal. Instead
of restricting consumption by in
creased prices, the government should
control distribution of food supplies
at home and overseas, he said.
The long eastern frontier. Colonel
Churchill argued, was the most vul
nerable and the inexhaustive armies
that Russia is able to bring into op
eration should be utilized fully. There
fore, he urged, the chancellor of the
exchequer to permit no financial con
siderations to stand in the way of
providing Russia to her utmost needs
with munitions and equipment upon
which, he said, everything now de
pends. THE SUMMARY
Both allied wings on the Saloniki
front, where the soldiers of at least
seven nations are in battle, have been
bent back by the Bulgarians. In the
center, however, where the allies'
main force is being made at the en
trance to the great Vardar valley,
Paris reports important gains.
Nothing is said about .ne Russian
or Italian shade in the fighting and
no information has been given as to
their strength. The Serbians appar
ently have been the heaviest losers
and have been forced back on their
extreme left about five miles from
the Serbian-Greek frontier. They
claim, however, continued progress on
the other sections of their front. On
the allied right British and French
who had crossed the Struma towards
the Bulgaran frontier have been
forced back on the river.
On the western front there has been
little change. The British continue
their efforts to surround Thiepval and
report the capture of 100 yards of
German trenches In the direction of
Martinputch. There has been no sec
tion of importance on other sections.
For several days meagre Russian re
ports have insisted that nothing of
Importance has occurred on the east.
An Interesting feature of the Russian
official statement is the intimation
that Grand Duke Nicholas again is
pressing his offensive in the Cauca
sus. For the last two days Petrograd
has emphasized the fighting around
Dierbakr, but no important change
has occurred.
London claims a heavy blow against
German on the sea. The British sub
marine E-23 reports having attacked
an 18.C00 German battleship and the
submarine's commander believes he
sank it.
There is no news from the Italian
front where a lull has existed for sev
eral days.
f ures,' Senator Simmons said Panama
bonds could be used to reimburse the
treasury, and added that up to this
time the Democratic party had issued
no Panama canal bonds, whereas the
Republicans during the Roosevelt and
Taft administrations sold $134,000,000
worth.
Senator Smoot asserted that the
Democratic party had not kept the
pledge of retrenchment and economy
and charged it with "wasteful and use
less expenditures too long for enumer

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. Eight
presidents of important railway sys
tems, who have been designated to
draft the railroad's reply to Presient
Wilson's appeal that they accept his
plan for averting a nation wide htrike.
were in almost continuous session to
day and tonight without solving their
problem.
Late tonight three of the commit
teemen. Hale Holden of the Burling
ton: R. S. Lovett o the Union Pacific
and Daniel Willard of the Baltimore
and Ohio, discussed the situation with
President Wilson. They were at the
White House for more than an hour
and on leaving declined to talk about
their visit further than to say they
j had asked for the conference to "dis-
cuss the general situation." and ex
j pected to see the President a.ain.
j Although some of the sixty or more
presidents are showing a disposition
to prolong the negotiations In the
j hope that the sentiment of business
I men of the country would be shown
i to be opposed to an eight hour day,
j there was a general feeling tonight
that a definite answer to President
! Wilson's demand cannot be much
I longer postponed. The President is
I understood to have indicated ;hat he
I desired his proposals to be fully de
I bated by the executives, but their con
ferences among themselves have fail-
' ed so far to develop any concrete
plan likely to win approval. So far
I as the presidents would discuss the
! situation tonight, they still are in
sistent upon an. arbitration of the
eight hour day and all other issues
with the employes.
As the conferees continued there
. was less talk of action which would
! lead to a strike, but some of the ex
! ecutives are expected to fight to the
i last ditch any plan which would force
; an eight hour day upon the roads
i without some form of arbitration. It
; was said at the White House confer
I ence they did not develop any actual
I plan but that the three executives
j wished to get President Wilson's
: views on various phases of the mat
! ter so that they could be outlined to
! the rest of the commission tomorrow,
j The executives are to realize that Mr.
' Wi'son cannot recede from t!:e posi-
tlon he has publicly taken and some
' of them are convinced now that about
; all they can hope for is f.o coiae out
with some concessions.
I Among the more than 600 represen
j tatlves of railroad brotherhoods in
I Washington there was evident a feel
I ing of restlessness and there were
many inquiries of leaders as to how
long they must remain. It is not ex-
pected that this feeling will lead to
j any open revolt unless the confer
j ences between President Wilson and
the executives are prolonged. Some
' leaders told inquirers today that they
j would not have to stay in Washington
; more than 48 hours,
j The railroad executives, who are
i counting upon winning President Wil
: son to their position in the neeotia
! tions say that the case after all is to
be decided by public opinion and that
this will be found to support arbitra
tion and condemn the eight hour day.
They made public tonight several
telegrams from commercial organiza
tions throughout the country uphold
ing arbitration for the settlement of
! labor disputes and opposing an eight
I hour day such as the employes desire.
Discontent over being held In Wash
I lneton without prospect of prompt
action by the railroad managers caus
ed some of the brotherhood men to
