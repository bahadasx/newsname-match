Precedlug Years.
THE DEMOCRATIC TEXT BOOK
So Announces After Comparing
Figures With Four Last
.Republican Years.
A TENTH MORE WAGK-KAKNKHS
During the Wilson Administra
tion, It is brought out in the second
chapter of the Democratic Cam
paign Text Hook, made public re
cently, the wage earners of the
country received In wages over $3,
000,000,000 more than durins the
four preceding years under a Repub
lican Administration.
These figures, it is explained, are
liased on a report just completed by
the United StatC3 Department of La
bor, which shows that the average
wage increase In the industries has
been -from 5 per cent, to 20 per
cent, during the last four years, and
that from 1913 to 191G, during the
Wilson Administration, wage earn
ers In United States were paid $17,
COO.000,000, as against $14,320.
000,000 during four years of the
Taft Administration.
In reviewing this (phase of the
campaign, the Text Cook says:
"Taking tho official daCa of the
United States Department of Labor
upon' union wages per hour as the
basis of computation, you find that
the average union wage during the
years 1914 and 1915, under Demo
cratic laws and administration, were
10 per cent, higher than the average
for six years 1907 to 1912 Inclu
sive under the DIngley and Payne
Tariff Laws and Republican Admin
istration; ,
"Taking as a basis a tabulation of
press announcements
of wage In-H
creases for 1916, made by the De
partment of Labor, It Is conservative
to place tho 1916 wage level at 10
per. cent, higher, than the Republic
an level of 1907-1912. " .
.'.'The census, of 1910 (based on
lifts data) gave the number of
wage earners employed In manufac
turing Industries only as 6,615,000,
and the wages paid $3,427,000,000.
lts estimated (on basis of prelimi
nary returns of 1014 census pf man
x ufacturep) that In 1915 American
manufacturers gave employment to
7.800.0QO wage earners at wages
amounting to $4,407,000,000, or an
increase of nearly $1,000,000,000
over 1910.
"It Is conservatively" estimated
that In 1916 American manufactur
ers employ 10 per cent, more wago
earners at 10 per cent, higher avor-
.ago rate of wages per annum than
in 1915. This would bring tho 191C
volume of wages paid in manufac
tures only, up to $5,300,000,000, or
-upward of $1,800,000,000 over tho
Republican census record of 1910.
"Theso figures are for wage earn
ers employed In manufacturing In
dustries only. Tho census of 1910
gave the total number employed In
manufacturing and mechanical in
dustries as 10,65S,0Q0, tu transpor
tation 2,637.000 and In mines 964.
824, and In agriculture, foresty and
animal husbandry (exclusive of 6,
000,000 farmers and other employ
ers) as 6,639,000, making a total
industrial army of wago earnors of
over 20,000,009."
The fact that the total numbor of
wago parners has Increased from 6,
000,900 in 1912 to S, 500,000 now ls
also brought out.

The probable winter wheat crop
Is only 470,000,000 bushels, a de
crease of 30 per cent, from the 1915
yield, but ,only slightly under the
average for the last ten years. Corn
will run close to 2,800,000,000
bushels, which is about tho average
for ten years. The decline In the
wheat yield Is not expected to have
a determent effect on general con
ditions. In at least" six States the pros
pect for tobacco Is excellent, despite
the injurious effects of storing In
North and South Carolina and Vir
ginia. Hay In general is a good
crop throughout the country. Cot
ton has suffered under trying weath
er conditions and the yield will not
be as great ns last year, despite tho
12 per cent. Increase in acreage.
Fruit is doing well throughout tho
country, watermelons , from the
southeastern counties of Missouri
being expected to yield $4,000,000
to the producers.
Though some of the cattle ranges
of tile Southwest, West and North
west have needed rain, the prices on
livestock are unusually encouraging.
Sheep and wool are bringing high
prices. Similar reports are made
concerning mules, horses, poultry
and pork.
STOCKHOLDERS ItUIlAIi
CRTDIT WILIj PROTEST
Lexington. Ky., Aug. 19,. It be
came known to-night that at several
Places over the State, stockholders
of the Kentucky Rural Credit Asso
ciation, which failed here three
weeks ago, will fight attempts of the
receiver to collect the nraoupt of
stock they subscribed for a total of
over $100,000. Public meetings will
be held and a general protest action
started. The first of these was at
Stanford, Lincoln county, and oth
ers will follow.
The stockholders say they are not
liable for the stock t hltasTAKONI
liable for the stock that 1st claimed.
The par value of the stock was $50,
being sold $100 and the extra $50
going to a surplus fund and largely
used for promotion expenses, which
amounted to about $177,000 in this
"million dollar South Sea Island Bub-
ble." The fighting of such collec-
tlons will prolong the legal tangle of
the situation and greatly Increase the
expenses of winding up the assocta-
tlon's affairs.
INCREASED COST FOR
NEWSPAPER SERVICK
Washington, Aug. 19. The news
papers all over the country report
to the Federal Trade Commission
that unless there ls relief from- the
high cost of news print paper, there
will have to be universally Increased
prices put upon tho newspaper ser
vice. In many cities of the country
prices to subscribers have already
been advanced, and In practically all
of the cities of the country Increase
In subscription prices will soon be
come a vital and unescapable ne
cessity, despite the hesitancy and
the unwillingness on the part of
newspaper publishers to take such a
stand. Despite increase In subscrip
tion prices and advertising rales, It
will be necessary for newspapers
to cut down the size of their papers
unless there Is relief from exccsslvo
cost of raw materials. Already New
York and Philadelphia publishers
have materially reduced the size of
their Issues.

PROSPECTS JIBE VERY BRIGHT
For Big Democratic Victory In
That Rock-Ribbed Repub
lican Stronghold.
H. O. I BOSSES ARE IN TAXOIiK
New York, Aug. 19. In announc
ing the result of a painstaking can
vass of the political situation in
Maine, made by James C. White, one
of the best, known political writers
of New England, the Boston Herald
(Republican), which is conducting
an earnest campaign In behalf of
Mr. Hughes, makes the admission
that "the present indications are
that the Democrats will administer
a smashing defeat to the Republi
cans at the September State Elect
ion." Summarizing the result of his In
vestigations, Mr. White, who ls re
ferred to editorially to-day In tho
Boston Herald as "our seasoned po
litical correspondent," says: "The
handwriting Is plain upon the wall
and It ls spelling defeat. 'And it ls
going to be a defeat all the more ag
gravating because It is unnecessary
for the reason that the Republicans,
who should know better, are at
tempting In a disorganized way to
make 'a vital campaign gainst! a
Democratic field composed of. Gov.
Curtis, Senator Johnson and W. It.
Pattangall, who have made organi
zation their fetish In all campaigns."
The writer describes the Demo
cratic organization in Maine as far
eup'erlor to that of the Republicans,
who, he asserts, lack a real leader.
Continuing, he says: "During the
past seventy-two hours spent in the
State, )Ig and Httle leaders have
been confessing that they 'are seri
ously worried over the governor
ship; that they are dubious about
the election of Col. Fred Hale, and
that the Hughes movement ls not
working as well as they hoped."
Referring to the Democratic cam
paign, he says: "Tho one unescapa
ble fact is that at a time when the
Democrats already have their cam
paign under way, with a general
manager In charge who has already
Bhot one bolt Into the Republican
campaign with some disastrous ef
fects, the Rebubllcans are still fus
sing around trying to get started.
"In tho headquarters of the Re
publican National Committee in New
York they have no delusions as to
the Maine situation. At the time of
the Hughes notification in New York
it was discussed at some length and
feeling was that the Maine Repub
licans should get busy and do some
thing." Tho results of Mr. White's can
vass of Maine are being published
In dispatches from that State. In
tlto article from which (the above
quotations are made, tho Herald an
nounces that the "Maine G. O. P.
must wake up or lose tho State."
In editorially commenting upon
the disclosures made by Mr. White,
tho Herald says: "It is difficult lo
exaggerate tho importuned of tho
outcome In Maine
It is a Repub-ice'l't
liean State. Its failure to give a
substantial Republican majority in
Septembnr would throw n chill over
the campaign from Portsmouth to
San Diego."
These tidings from Maine, follow-
In the word from California that
Candidato Hughes upon tho eve of
his Presidential canvass In that
State Is mot faeo to face with an Ir
reconcilable breach between the Re
publicans and Progressives at na
tional Republican headquarters).

Washington, Aug. 20. President
Wilson's work of conferences with
ranking officials of the railroads and
leaders of their employes threaten

ed by all parties to the controversy
to have brought the situation to a
point where decisive developments
may conio within a few days. While
the negotiations took no actual for-

Mllledgevllle, da., Aug. 19. In a
Mllledgevllle street a tall. Portly
gentleman came up to Professor O.
M. Cone, teacher of mathematics In
Georgia .Military college. The stran
ger carried a long hickory switch In
his hand. He ask;d If this was Pro
fessor Cone, and being answered In
the affirmative, said:
"My name, sir. Is John Lehman.
Forty years ago when you were
teaching in the old field school at
hland Creek, In Hancock county,
my parents, then living in Florida,
sent me up to your school. Otie day
vou decided that a good whipping
was Just what I needed to set me
right, and you sent me out to get
the switch. You may remember,
sir, that I never came back. I saw
my chance to escape, and I ran
away. This Is the first time I have
seen you since that day. Rut t have
never felt right about the way I did
and I have come back now all the
way from my home In Brunswick to
take my whipping. Here is the
switch."
Of course Professor Cone agreed
in the circumstances to let bygones
be bygones, and he and hia former
pupil shook hands and had a good
laugh together.

THE CA.H OF A (I LASS HOUSE
When he was Secretary of State,
Mr. Bryan Wrote a letter to the Re

inquiring as to what positions could
lie obtained for "deserving Demo

this letter in his speeches declaring
It "shameful," and the Commoner
comes back at him like a thousand

forced the civil service law to tho
letter with the- employeej of the
State Department wherever it wan in
force, but ho felt free to reward de
serving Democrats whenever it
could be done without detriment to
the service. Then, after declaring
that Mr. Hughes has shown himself

Impudence to hold up for criticism a

This seems to have brought Mr.
