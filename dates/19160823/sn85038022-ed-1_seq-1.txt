IHe.cnse.ee. Situation.
Washington, August 22 Eight presl
denta of Important railway systems
who have been designated to draft the
railroads' reply to President Wilson's
appeal that they accept his plan for
averting a nation-wide atrlke, were In
almost continuous session today and
tonight solving their problems.
Lte tonight three of the committee
men; Hale Holden, of the Burlington:
R. S. Lovett, of the Union Pacific, and
Daniel Willard, of the Baltimore &
Ohio, discussed the situation with
President Wilson. They were at the
White House for more than an hour
and on leaving declined to talk about
their visit, further than to say they
had asked for the conferenee to "dis
cuss the general situation" and ex
pected to see the President again.
Definite Answer Noon
Although Home of the sixty or more
presidents are showing a disposition
to prolong the negotiations In the
hope that the sentiment of business
men of the county will be shown to
be opposed to the idea of an eight
hour day, there was a general feeling
tonight that a definite answer to Presi
dent Wilson's demands can not be
much longer postponed. The Preal
dent is understood to have Indicated
that he desires his proposal to be fully
debated by the executives, but their
conferences among themselves have
failed so far to develop any concrete
plan likely to win approval.
So far ns the President would dis
cuss the situation tonight, they still
are insisting upon an arbitration of
the eight-hour day and all other Is
sues with the employes. Aa the con
ferences continue heir is less talk of
action which would lead to a strike,
but some of Uie executives are ex
pected to fight to the last ditch any
plan which would force an eight-hour
day upon the roads without some form
of arbitration.
No New Plans Developed
It la understood the White Houac
conference tonight did not develop
any actual plans, but that the three
executives wished to get President
Wilson's views on various phases of
the matter so that they could be out
lined to the reBt of the committee to
morrow. The executives are said to
realize that Mr. Wilson can not re
cede from the position he has pub
licly taken, and aome of them are
convinced now that about all they
can hope for is to come out with some
concessions.
Among the more than 600 represen
tatives of the rairoad Brotherhoods
in Washington there was evident to
day a feeling of restlessness, and
there were many Inquiries of leaders
as to how long they must remain. It
is not expected that this feeling will
lead to any open revolt unless the
conferences between President Wil
son and the executives are prolonged.
Executives Seeks Support
The railroad executives who are
counting upon winning the President
to their position in the negotiations
say that the ease after all Is to be de
cided by public opinion, and that this
will be found to support arbitration
and condemn tho eight-hour day. They
made public tonight several tele
grams from commercial organizations
throughout the country upholding ar
bitration for the settlement of labor
disputes and opposing an elgat-nour
day such as the employes desire.
The cabinet discussed the situation
ut today's meeting and, in the opinion
of some, the danger of a strike has
been greatly lessened.
It Is understood that the chief ob
ject of the visit to the White House
as to ask the President to state
specifically how he expected the rail
roads to make up the millions of dol
lars which the managers say It will
cost them to put Into effect the eight
hour basic day they are asked to
giant. What the President said In
reply none of the committeemen
would reveal.
Heretofore, according to the rall-
rroad men, Mr Wilson has dealt with
tliis phase of the subjec only In the
most general terms.
