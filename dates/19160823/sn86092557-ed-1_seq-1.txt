Charming Arkansas Women
in Charge of the Suf
frage Booth.
Misses Gertrude Watkins and Jose
phine Miller, of Little Hock. Arkansas,
organizers for the National American
Woman Suffrage Association, are in
Fairmont this week working in behalf
of the pending suffrage amendment.
These two charming young women are
making their headquarters at the booth
of the local Political Equality Club at
the Fair grounds. They are sincere
and ardent workers for the cause and
are arousing great interest in the en
franchisement of women.
Miss Watkins is a member of one
of the oldest and most prominent fam
ilies in her native state. She is a
granddaughter of Chief Justice Wat
kins, one of the state's finest citizens.
Miss Watkins has had much practical
experience in suffrage work in Chi
cago and Now York city. In the lat
ter city during the 1915 campaign she
attracted the attention of the national
organization and has become one oi
the most effective workers in tho coun
try.
Miss MiHer is a New York girl, but
has made her home in Arkansas for
several years. She has always been
interested in work for civic better
ment and is a trained nurse, having
taken her course at the Roosevelt hos
pital in the metropolis. When the
European war broke out she respond
ed to the call for nurses and joined
Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney's relief ex
pedition. For eight months she min
istered to the wounded and dying in
France, the greater part of the time
being within a few miles of the Ver
dun front.
Visitors to the Fair are urged to call
at the suffrage booth on the grounds
where they can obtain authoritative
information on the most important
question now before the electorate.

THE TEST
Luis H. Yanes of Caracas,
Venezuela in the"
i ?... City.
Luis H. Yanes, of Caracas, general
Venezuela representative of the Mo
nongah Glass company, who has been
in Fairmont for several days on a visit
to the factory, will leave tomorrow
for Washington and New York from
which latter place he expects to sail
soon for home.
This is Mr. Yanes' first visit to North
America and he has found much that
interested him. He has been in thb
United States about two months and
has been making the most of the timo
at his disposal to get acquainted with
the country. He is a good looking,
alert young man of engaging manners
and but for the slight accent with
which he talks English he might pass
anywhere for an American business
man from the middle west. He is un
married. While in this city he was
shown the sights by Tobe Blumen
thall, who Is in charge of the Latin
American business of the Monongah
Glass company.
Mr. Yanes says that the war in Eu
rope has increased the sale of Ameri
can goods In South America because
it has cut off the customary supply
from Europe. Ab to whether this new
business will be retained by the Amer
ican exporters, well, Mr. Yanes is ex
tremely polite about it, but if one is
mentally alert it is not hard to gather
that he thinks that is a matter that is
entirely up to the American exporter
and, therefore, not very encouraging
to the prospects for American trade.
The trouble lies in the fact that the
American exporter is willing to do
very little to oblige the, foreign cus
tomer. Mr..Yanes tells of one order
for cement that was cancelled because
the exporter was not willing to put
one extra hoop around the middle of
the barrels. The customary hoops at
the ends of '.he barrels did not make
the package secure enough for the
p-irpoBe of the Venezuelan trade and
the agent at Caracas asked that one
more band be put, about the. center of
the barrel at his expense. But the
American cement people declared that

STATEMENT BY HOLDEN.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.?Pre*.
Ident Holden, of the Burlington,
and chairman of committee of
eight, made the following state*
ment today:
"A meeting of presidents and
managers \*m held at eleven
o'clock and a recess was taken un
til six o'clock, in tha meantime
the special committee of the pres
idents is in session giving further
consideration to various problems
presented by the situation."
Mr. Holden also stated that the
report being circulated that any
conclusion has been reached was
incorrect
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.?President
Wilson today summoned Senator New
lands and Representative Adam son,
chairman of the Tenate and House
Commerce committees to the White
House. It is said he plans to discuss
*-ith them legislation on the railroad
strike situation.
Under the present plan for settle
ment of the rail^IMl $spute, Congress
would create a commission to inves
tigate the workings of the eight-hour
day and collateral issues.
An employees' meeting this morn
ing was thrown into an uproar by
speeches of a minority which demand
ed immediate action unless the roads
accept the President's plan, but the
leaders succedod in ^Ijovning it
before any vote could be taken on any
of the various proposals.
They said afterward that while pres
sure for immediate action came from
minority it was strong. But they be
lieved the majority would be willing
to give the president a little more
time. Some of the men urged that
most of them go home, leaving broth
erhood heads with authority to call a
strike if the railroads do not accept
the president's plan.
The meeting adjourned until tomor
row* Tnorning. Frequently shouts and
applause was beard as far as a block
jaway irom the hall. \
"It is our belief one of the commit
teemen said "that the railroads are
playing us for time with the President
| Just as they have done with us for
many months. ? There Is no reason why
they should not have given the presi
dent an answer by thla time."
