Chiefs Causes Icjatience
Washington, Aug. 23 Strike talk
broke out again among the railroad
brotherhood men here today, Thomas
Donovan, the Boston and Albany
chairman, proposed at the morning
session that the brotherhood chair
men return to their homes, leaving
the four heads here to arrange' ft
strike. His effort, however, was, for
the present crushed. ;
For ft time it appeared as though
the sentiment for quick action might
not be checked. There were many
speeches. ' Brotherhood heads, see
ing the trend of the session, came to
the fore and spoke against such a
drastlo course. " Finally, through par
liamentary maneuvering Donovan's
plan was killed without being made
Into ft formal motion or coming to
any vote. ' 'v. ; . ,V
The strike threat. was so strong
that it was plainly Indicated after
ward that the leader? might not be
able to check" the men more than 48
hours longer. One brotherhood lead
er said they could be kept In line that
long, but that the lid might blow
off thereafter.
Lesders counselled patience, be
lieving matters would come to ft head
in the next 24 to 48 boon.

before late at night.
Ho was scheduled yesterday to
make 1 4 speeches, but at least eight
were added at the last moment. The
nominee has ruled that be will not
disappoint a crowd when It besieges
his private car and this very willing
ness led the local committees to Im
pose on him.
Hughes apparently talks with great j
facility but It Is ft facility which he
has aoqulred only through a long
period of concentration and prepar
ation. Roosevelt, whose trans
continental trip of four years ago Is
really surpassed In strenuoslty by
Hughes,' has a faculty for quick con
centration .and little preparation, but
Hughes' service on the bench and the
painstaking legal mind wlfh which he
Is equipped force htm to study long
and arduously lu mapping out all of
his talks even the smallest ones.'
Hughes' present trip, therefore, Is
even harder on the candidate than bis
schedule Indicates, because so little
time Is granted him for preparation.
Governor Hughes addressed 4,000
persons In Sacramento last night at a
meeting which was declared by, the
republican state loaders to be "non
partisan." Labor legislation and a
federal workmen's compensation law
were discussed at considerable length
by him. He declared strongly for pre-
