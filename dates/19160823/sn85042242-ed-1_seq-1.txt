Sept. 1.
Governor L. B. Hanna is taking
steps to see if it is possible for the
boys who will be relieved of duty to
attend the University to ibe furnished
with transportation from the 'border
to their homes. He has taken the
matter up with the war department.
When men have been relieved upon
application they have been forced to
pay their,farft home. President Mc
Vey of the university took the matter
up with Governor Hanna, who laid
the situation of the students' release
before Col. J. H. (Fraine of the First
Nbrth Dakota regiment.
The guardsmen who desire to re­
turn to school probably will be re­
lieved of duty September 1, 19.16, un­
less the military situation becomes
more acute than it is now. In an in­
teresting lettef to Governor Hanna,
Col. Fraine gives an account of con­

it strikes me that policy is in ac­
cord with the desire of President Mc­
Vey, as a reading of a letter from the
adjutant general of the army to the
commanding. general of the southern
department, subject: Students in the
National Guard dated July 29, 1916,
would indicate that bona fide students
who can show a bona fide intention of
entering, or returning to schools in
the fall of 1916 will be discharged as
soon as practicable after September
1, 1916, unless the military situation
at that time is such as to render their
retention in the service necessary.
"I know you will ibe interested in
hearing of the conditions surrounding
us and the situation here as I see it.
We are located one-half mile from
the depot at (Mercedes, Texas, a town
of six* or eight hundred people, plat­
ted and run originally by the Ameri
can-Rio Grande Irrigation and Land
company, five miles north of Rio
Grande, and are in camp alone, being
about three and one-half miles east
of the balance of the division at Llano
Grande. The soil here is a silty de­
posit with 'dobe characteristics, the
ground very flat and when it rains,
which, so far, has been practically
every day, makes it unpleasant to get
around in, and we are having some
trouble in getting any kind of drain­
age. Such of our officers as are en­
gineers have borrowed a transit and
have run lines, and about every wak­
ing moment, outside of drills and
other military work, the men are
ditching) so that I expect within a day
or two we will have all this storm
water taken away by means of these
ditches, when 'it "will be much more
comfortable.
In Good HealtH.
"The men are in good health and
spirits with the exception of a few
who have had diarrhoea, incident to
the change of water, food and cli
maate, but this is being eliminated.
We have none dangerously ill. The
men are making a fine reputation for
themselves and from what I have seen
of other troops and heard from regu­
lar officers, the universal opinion
down here is that this is the 'best reg­
iment on the border. 1 know it sounds
bombastic and rboastful to send this
word home and, realizing that other
regiments are sending similar reports
to their own homes, 'but can assure
you that this statement is not based
entirely upon my own opinion.
-'We are still short some clothing,
but received some yesterday and in
a few days will ibe much more com­
fortably situated. We also will re
ceive some tentage and in due course
of time will receive such tentage, so
that not more than eight men will oc­
cupy each pyramidal tent. It would
be delightful if you could (fad time
to come down here. I know- every­
body would be pleased to see yau and
I know that in your own inimitable
way, upon your return to the state,
you can tell the parents how comfort­
ably their boys are getting on and
what a world of good this will do for
them.

Ambulance
Fund Boosted
Nearly $50
It is likely that within the next
week or two the fund to purchase an
ambulance for the First North Dako­
ta regiment will be closed. All towns
which have subscriptions and indi­
viduals who have not subscribed are
urged to send their contributions eith­
er to Major Steedman, E. (H. Dummer
or the Tribune. A complete report
of the fund will be given •when all
points have been heard from.
W. J. Prater, custodian of the funds
raised by the game between the Fats
and the Leans last week, reported yes­
terday that the total receipts wer
$58.25. There was $10 expense whicu
left $48.25 net for the fund.
Major Patterson and Dr. T. M. Mc
Lachlan are anxious for the motor
equipment to replace the out-of-date
conveyance now in use.
If you or your town has not contrib­
uted to the First regiment, show your
appreciation of the sacrifice the boys
are making and send in something.
It is not the amount, but the spirit
in which the donation is made.
The new ambulance will be the
property of the First regiment and
not the federal government. When
the troops are ordered home, the am­
bulance will be shipped back to this
state and used in the summer train­
ing camps or when the North Dakota
boys are called to the colors again.

iNew York, Aug. 22.—Sentiment in
Denmark is strongly against the sale
of the Danish West Indies to the
United States, according to Count
Frederick Holtky, a captain in the
Danish army, who arrived here today,
aboard the 'Scandinavian American
liner, Hellwig Olaf. Count Moltky is
on his 'way to Washington, where he
will join the Danish legation as di­
rector of army contracts.
'^Sentiment in (Denmark does not
favor the sale of the Danish West
Indies," the count declared.
"It is not a matter of price, but a
feeling of sentiment among the peo­
ple that has caused such strong op­
position to the sale."
iMarius I. iMyeboe, a prominent
ship owner of Denmark, and a well
'known Arctic explorer, who is on his
way to Greenland, supplemented
Count Moltky's statement by saying
that the sentiment in Denmark is to
postpone the sale until the end of the
war.
REVENUE BILL
Democrats Want an Emergency
Fund in Excess of $200,.

Washington, Aug. 22.—Senator Sim­
mons, chairman of the finance com­
mittee, submitting) figures designed
to disprove Republican charges of ex­
travagance, and Senator Smoot, Re­
publican finance expert, asserting that
the Democratic party should be con­
victed of attempting to procure votes
under false pretenses, general de
'bate on the $205,'000,000 emergency
revenue bill began today in the sen­
ate.
Insisting that national defense pre­
paredness and the Mexican situation
were altogether responsible for the
necessity of special revenue legisla­
tion and a proposed 'bond issue, Sen­
ator Simmons declared that Republi­
cans in congress had even clamored
for greater expenditures for defense
and, having done this, were seeking
partisan advantages by making false
charges of Democratic extravagance
to the public.
Senator Smoot, opening the assault
on the revenue bill, said if the Dem­
ocratic party were to be retained in
control of the government the -country
"would suffer an era of unqualified
extravagance combined with ineffi­
ciency unsurpassed."

Zone.
PARIS CLAIMS
GAINS IN CENTER
Little Change Is Reported on the
Various Western
Fronts.
London, Aug. 22.—Both allied wings
on the Saloniki friSht, where the sol­
diers of at least seven nations are in
battle, have been sent back by the
Bulgarians. In the center, however,
where the Allies' attack is being made
at the entrance to the Strait Vardar
Valle, Paris reports important gains.
Nothing is said about the Russian or
Italian share in the fighting, and no
information has been given as to their
strength. The Serbians apparently
have been the heaviest losers, and
have been forced back on their ex­
treme left about five miles from the
Serbian-Greek frontier. They claim,
however, continued progress on the
other section of their front.
Forced Back.
On the Allies' right, the British and
French who had crossed the Struma,
toward the Bulgarian frontier, have
been forced back on the river.
On the western front, there has
been little change. The British con­
tinue their efforts to surround Thiep
val, and report the capture of 100
yards of German trenches in the di­
rection of Martimpulcty. There has
no action ofimportance on*the
French section.
For several days, meagre Russian
reports have insisted that nothing of
importance has occurred in the east.
Berlin, however, describes very heavy
fighting, both on the Stokhod and in
the Carpathians.
Pressing Offensive.
An interesting feature of the Rus­
sian official statement is the intima­
tion that the Grand Duke Nicholas
again is pressing his offensive in the
Caucasus. For the last two days, Pet
rograd has emphasized the fighting
around Diarbekr, but no important
change has occurred.
DICKINSON PIONEER
DIES IN CALIFORNIA
Dickinson, Aug. 22.—George Auld,
who settled in Dickinson back in
1882, during pioneering days, died at
Sawtelle, California, on Thursday of
last week, following a complic&ion of
diseases. He had been a great suffer­
er for the past two years, and his
death was not entirely unexpected.
Deceased came to this city when it
was enly a hamlet of frontier shacks,
and for '2(7 years was closely identified
with business and political life of the
town and county, engaging in the mer­
cantile business and holding the offic­
es of county auditor and register of
deeds for several years. He later en­
gaged in the realty business. When
the call for volunteers for the Span­
ish-American war came in 1897, Mr.
Auld and A. J. Osborn organized Com­
pany of Dickinson, and went with
the company to the Philippine Islands
the following year. Mr. Auld was
captain of the company.
Hogs Highest
Since Civil
War Prices
Chicago, Aug. 22.—Hoga told
for $11.30 a hundredweight at the
Union Stock Yards today, the
highest price in the history of the
market since the Civil war. Deal
era predict an advance to $12.00
per hundredweight in September.
A further advance was noted in
the price of beans. A year ago
beans cost the housewives 5c a
pound. The retail price now ia
11c a pound. The demand for
beans for European armies and
for United States troops along
the border are said to be the prin­
cipal causes for the advance in
price.
At East St Louis, Pittsburg,
and Indianapolis yards, hogs also
sold at $11.30, highest record
prices for those markets.

Minneapolis, Aug. 22.—A movie-like

noon today resulted in the arrest of
John Miller, suspected of being an
agent of "Big Bill," Chicago, known
as head of the automobile theft syndi­
cate.
Trap Laid.
A trap laid for the arrest of "Big
Bill" himself, believed by the sheriff's
office to be in Minneapolis to collect
payment for two stolen automobiles
driven from Chicago to St. Bonifacrus,
failed to work.
Miller, arrested after half a dozen
policemen had chased' him four blocks,
and after he had kicked one of them
part way dawn a stairway, when
brought to bay, denied that he knew
"Big 'Bill." He was locked up in the
city hall without a charge, after a
clash between the police department
and the sheriff's office over his cus­
tody.
Meanwhile Ira Bond, Minneapolis
broker, who recently was arrested
and released at Davenport in connec­

but his release was again obtained,

To Meet Quinn.
V. L. Quinn, an operative of the
•Northwestern Detective bureau, told
the sheriff's office today that "Big
Bill" himself was to meet Quinn at
the West hotel at 11 a. m. to receive
$200 due on two stolen cars delivered
by the "syndicate" at St. Bonifacrus.

money. Three deputy sheriffs were
assigned to watch Quinn and to ar
rest "Big Bill" after the money had
been paid over.

There is no news from the Italian
front, where a lull lias existed for
several days.
The three went to the hotel at 11
a. m. and waited half an hour. Fin

Quinn. He told Quinn, according to
the detective's subsequent story, that
he represented "Big Bill" and had
come to get the money.
"I told him I'd pay the money to
'Big Bill' in person or to nobody,"
said Quinn later.
'Red" Fleet to Run Blockade
Set by Those on the "Blue"
Side.
Washington, Aug. 22.—Two mighty
fleets were grappling for each other
in the dark tonight, somewhere off the
Atlantic coast, in the opening phase
of the most elaborate war game ever
attempted iby the navy department.
The navy department on a war foot­
ing was invoking every agency to aid
Rear Admiral Helm, commanding the
"Blue" defending fleet, which was
sweeping seaward behind a line of
scouts, nearly 600 miles long, to re­
pulse Adimral (Mayo's "Red" 'battle
fleet.
The game began at 6 o'clock this
morning, when Admiral Helm on his
flagship, the Rhode Island, received
word that an agent of the state de­
partment, aboard a ship (bound from
New York to Gibraltar, had reported
15 battleships of the "Red" fleet 600
miles due east of Cape Hatteras,
with 30 transports bringing an Army
of invasion to ibe landed somewhere
between Cape Hatteras and Eastport,
Maine.
An hour after the report came, the
12 battleships of Admiral Helm's
main fighting fleet, armed in part by
civil volunteers and naval militiamen,
were headed southward from Narra
gansett. Ahead of them, were speed­
ing nearly a score of swift destroy­
ers and a cruiser squadron.
Admiral Mayo's problem is to force
a way through the "Elue" fleet for his
transports.

SKETCHES WHAT G. 0. P.
PARTY HAS DONE
Under Its Auspices, Safety Ap­
pliances Provided in Hazard­
ous Employment.
Sacramento, Cal., Aug. 22.—Charles
E. Hughes, before an audience here
tonight, declared far an adequate com­
pensation law, providing compensa­
tion to persons injured in hazardous
employment engaged in interstate
commerce.
"T rejoice in what has been done un­
der Republican auspices in the federal
sphere—that is, in that department of
activity which, under our constitu­
tion, is subject to federal regulation.
"It was under Republican admini­
stration that the safety appliance act
was passed, a great safeguard of safe­
ty of railway employes. It was under
Republican administration that that
act was amended by congress so as
to give a far-wider degree of protec­
tion to safety appliances of various
sorts than was formerly accorded.
"It was under Republican adminis­
tration that cohgress passed the hours
of service act, in order to prevent the
undue exhaustion of employes,
through hours of labor, which were
excessive. It was under Republican
administration that the employers'
liability act of 1906 was passed.
"We have had a remarkable record
of achievements in the interest of fair
legislation under the Republican aus­
pices. I desire to see legislation of
that cl aracter, and every reasonable
sort for the protection of labor enact­
ed, to the end that there may be a
feeling through this country that jus­
tice is being done.
"And I desire to see our wasteful
system of negligent actions replaced
by proper compensation laws. That
has been achieved in many states.
The bill before congress deals only
with government employes. In my
judgment, there should be an ade­
quate compensation act, dealing with
this, subject to the supervision of
congress in connection with hazard­
ous interstate commerce."

The market has been strong in

The advance is expected to prove
a boon to farmers of the Ameri­

going into the raising of this
grain quite extensively of late
years. The highest previous price

February, last year.

HE YACHT
Not One Tent Goes Down in the
Terrific Storm of Last
Week.
COMPANIES TO SEE
BORDER PATROL DUTY
By Ewing Lewis.
Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 22.—One of
the heaviest hurricanes which has
ever swept Texas went over the back
of the first North Dakota regiment
last 'Friday and Saturday like water
off a duck's back. Company A of Bis­
marck rode the storm like a yatch.
Not a tent went down. But it was an
exciting afternoon and night and as
the 35-mile wind chased the rain over
the chapparal and telegraph wires
went down with the flash—(wind get­
ting stronger here). It kept every
man busy renewing tent stakes and
fixing ropes. The admirable engineer­
ing work of the regiment was shown
in the way the field drained during the
torrent. The rain poured from the
middle of the morning until after
midnight. At noon the next day you
could have shot a game of billiards
on the Bismarck company street.
Masons of the North Dakota regi­
ment were made welcome a few
nights ago by the lodge at Mercedes.
Capt. A. B. Welch attended. He met
Major Noble of the Second Indiana,
who directed the engineering work of
the big Llano Grande camp, three
miles from the Dakotans. Major Noble
praised the way the western regiment
had established its camp.
It is likely that one or two compan­
ies of the regiment will soon be as­
signed to border patrol work. That
the war department does not intend
to keep the guards in a training camp
very long before giving them real
patrol work is shown by the order
just received to send two companies
of Indiana soldiers and one Minnesota
unit to five pumping stations on the
Rio Grade, all within 25 miles of Mer­
cedes. The Minnesota men will be
placed at 'Progresso, where the Mer­
cedes pumping station is located. The
(North Dakota regiment visited this
point on a hike two days ago.
The men were on a 14-mile hike
when the hurricane started and did a
half-dozen miles through deep inky
mud (the Texans call it "gumbo")
and sheets of rain blown along by a
35-mile wind. The men arrived in
camp soaked, but grinning. There
were no drills the afternoon of the
storm. Sentries were allowed to stay
in the guard tent and the elements
guarded the camp from Mexicans.
TANGO MUST 60

Chicago, Aug. 22.—The old-fashion­

robatic tango in the ballrooms of the
nation, if the National Associaation
of .Dancihg .Masters have any influ­
ence. In convention here, the danc­
ing professors have decreed that the
tango must go. The waits, the one

fashionable favorites this season.
