Great Northern Has Bad Accident on
Cascade Line Near Everett—Two
Coaches Thrown 300 Feet Down
Side of Embankment
Seattle, Jan. 22.—Great Northern train No. 25, the
Cascade limited from Spokane, was struck by a snow slide
near Corea station, on the west slope of the Cascades, near
the mountain summit this morning.
The train was standing still when hit. The dining
car and day coach received the full force of the avalanche,
and were carried down the embankment 300 feet.
All persons in the two cars must have been killed or
badly injured. Physicians have been sent from Everett.
The train had been stopped by a small slide, which had
covered the track. Workmen had just completed remov
ing the snow and debris from the rails, and the train was
about to proceed when the avalanche thundered down from
the mountainside above the track.
The dining car and day coach were struck squarely on
the side and carried away as though they had been chips.
Other cars and the engine were left on the track.
Corea is about 120 miles east of Seattle, and is situated
at the loop of the big switchback. It is the second station
down the west slope from the Cascade tunnel, and is al
most the exact spot where a train was swept from the
tracks February 28,1910.
Seattle, Jan. 22.—From five to fifteen persons were
killed and a number injured as the result of a snow slide
at Corea, on the western slope of the Cascade mountains,
which caught the westbound Great Northern train No. 25,
swept the chair car and diner into a gulch, and overturned
one sleeping car.
Five dead have been rescued, while ten or twelve pas
sengers are still imprisoned in the wreckage, which has
started to burn.
Cries for help from the cars in the gulch, heard on the
track above, where the engine, baggage and observation
car were left standing, showed some were still alive.

"If congress is not ready yet to

said, "the measures which are enact

they go, are in accord with this great

Balkans Still Center.
The Balkans continue to take pre
cedence in war news, both Monte

notable interest.
The situation in each, however, is
somewhat clouded by the paucity of
direct news, and decided the conflict
in such advices as received.
Further reports regarding the re
sumption of hostilities between Mon
tenegro and Austria, following the re
jection of peace terms by the former,
are lacking, and there is small disposi
tion in Teutonic quarters even to ad
mit that there has been any break in
the negotiation.
A Berlin dispatch, however, quotes
a Cologne newspaper as conceding
that obstacles had arisen during the
negotiation.
Petrograd claims further Russian
successes in the Caucasus, declaring
that the Turks in the vicinity of Er

retreating precipitately to the 'protec

of the prominent young women of her
home town. The acquaintance was
renewed when Dr. Merrifield came to

Presumed That Entente

Berlin, Jan. 22—The Overseas News

"Competent German authorities
state that during the month of De

which were one British auxiliary
cruiser and two British transports,
with & total tonnage of 104,764 were
destroyed by the allies' fleets. Re
liable reports about ships destroyed
by mines and collisions are still lack
ing, and the real losses therefore are
superior. The total will not be less
than 180,000 tons."
As the Overseas News agency ln its
dispatches usually refers to the en

Is presumed that German authorities
are making the claim that fleets of
