"Your daughter was down to my

The philoropher took a fresh chew.

Harmful Effects of Sitting
" A leisurely indulgence in sitting is
blamed for a great deal of the failure
of our vital organs properly to perform
their natural function of properly di
gesting the food committed to their
care. Our chairs generally have hollow
backs which allow us to curve our
bodies in a way that relaxes the front
of the abdomen and lets the large in
testine fall down into folds, making
kinks that obstruct the movement of
food material, causing displacements
and ultimate discomfort.
In calling attention to this a health
magazine says that the natural posi
tionsfora man are lying down and
standing up and that sitting is not a
natural position.
Mention is made of the custom of the
savage, who does not sit in a chair or
perch upon a log, but reclines, resting
on an elbow or lying on the ground.
These are natural positions. But we
have invented chairs and finding them
convenient for sitting at a desk or table
and we get into bad habits. Ex.
School Work
In County
An Address by School Com'r
May L. Stewart.
Given at the Annual Meeting of
Charlevoix County School Officers.
A common problem faces all school
officers. Teachers are confronted with
the same problems of school room im
provement. We must work together
to get results. If we work together but
part of the time we shall get only
partial results. We must work to
gether from the beginning unto the
end.
The annual report is a source of
some annoyance but is a necessity to
the state department. Let us group
the mistakes of this year under three
headings. First you get your statistics
at the top of your report from your
teacher's register. These registers are
of every kind and every description.
Many of them do not even follow the
directions of the state department in
finding totals. If every director in
Charlevoix County will buy a Hamlin
Smith's Combination Register from
Henry Pattengill, Lansing, Michigan,
for the mere sum of seventy-five cents,
we can start the new year with a clean
page. I can then assure you that every
county normal graduate will have learn
ed how to make out this report and will
realize its importance. Every experi
enced teacher will have had experience
also in handling a register just like
yours and it will be easier for her to
make a correct report. I am sure your
teacher will be glad to copy her term
reports into a new register and you
will find that it is worth while. Per
haps you already have this register; if
not that is what you want without de
lay and with uniform registers thruout
the county, we cau save time, labor,
postage and temper. Second, no matter
what system of books yon as director
may be keeping, you should keep all
your receipts and all your expenditures
on two pages facing each other just as
the department has recommended in
"Digest of Schools Laws." With
everything altogether, you can com
pute your totals at a glance, you will
save a great deal of inconvenience at
the close of the school year, and no
doubting elector can question your
method. The mistakes in the census
roll are due to various causes but if we
study the instructions carefully we can
easily overcome this fault.
The one thing I have been trying to
hit the hardest this fall is the at
tendance record. There are many
schools in which the percentage is not
above sixty percent and nearly all of
the absence inexcusable. You pay
your teacher full wages every month to
teach the children who are enrolled.
Her time is wasted by thoughtless par
ents who keep their children at home
regardless of compulsory education
laws. We intend to enforce these laws
but we need your cooperation to raise
the standard in your district.
The boys and girls are anxious to
come in order to win the certificates of
award and diplomas of honor granted
by every teacher. Would the parents
of your district not work also for a
district prize? Would you strive for
first place with your neighboring
district? During the June session of
the board of supervisors I hope to ob
tain permission to offer an award in
money for the highest percentage of
attendance during the next school year.
This money would be sent directly to
the school board of the winning district
with the one proviso that the money be
spent entirely on school room improve
ment leading to a standard plate.
The state department endorses pota
to vacations; we are glad to grant this
time to help the farmer and to show
our approval of hard manual labor. It
is- good for boys and girls, good for
all of us but when the vacation is over
every child should be in school, not
part of the time but all of the time and
not on the 'second or third day but on
the very first day after the vacation.
We, you and I have a right to expect
this much from the parents of this
county as a square American deal. In
October just at the close of potato vaca
tion, it was necessary for Mr. Dean to
serve thirty notices in one week. Not a
square deal, is it? YOU have the
chance to tell your taxpayers this when
they ask for such a vacation again and
you have the privilege of insisting on
perfect attendance when school is in
session.
Next year, thanks to our law-makers,
every teacher must have either expert
ence or normal training or both. Your
teacher cannot gtt her certificate re
newed unless she attends a state nor
mal at least one summer in three.
There are five reading circle classes
In the county to give every teacher a
chance to read the reading circle books
If your teacher is truly progressive she
will belong to one of these and you
have a right to expect her to do this.
A number of years ago our county
had a uniform system of text books:
Baldwin's Readers, Milne's Arithmetics,
Redway and Hinman's Geographies,
Overton's Physiology and Harrington's
Spellers. But methods have changed a
great deal since those times; our teach
ers are trained in new methods and
those books follow the old. Teachers
realize this difficulty and are asking
for new texts. few have succeeded.
Where the books are old you need new
books anyway. So when you change
the books in your district, if you will
adopt the recommended list in the back
of the directory you will find that
teacher and pupils will both progress
more rapidly. Very soon your neigh
boring school will have the same texts
and with new uniform books in the
county every teacher you hire will al
ready be familiar with the texts you
use. Thus you will save time and work
in the school room. The recommend
ed books are the books you want in
the back of this year's directory.
Let me take this opportunity to an
nounce in person that I shall be in
Boyne City in the central school build
ing 10-12 a. m., the second Saturday of
each month, in Charlevoix school build
ing on the third Saturday 10-12 a. m.,
and in East Jordan at home on either
the first or fourth Saturday. I have
these office hours in order to learn
how the schools in each vicinity are
progressing and it would please me to
have you or any of your patrons call to
acquaint me with these conditions.
We want 15 Standard Schools in 191G.
But what is a Standard School? A
Standard School is one that the state
department is not ashamed of. It is a
school that is properly equipped, has
its pupils correctly and comfortably
seated, has enough windows properly
placed, and a good ventilating system.
It is a school which the' department
openly endorses by placing on the
front of the building a plate bearing
the words "Standard School."
As we look over the boys and girls of
our county schools can we realize what
figures show? That at the present rate
one out of every five will die of con
sumption? That of those who die three
out of every four are infected in the
school room before the age of sixteen?
Can we realize that in the dust of the
poorly swept, poorly ventilated room,
87 per cent of our boys and girls are
already infected with the dread white
plague? In the face of these figures
is it too much to ask that every
school be thoroughly cleaned every
month just as you would clean your
kitchens? In the presence of a repre
sentative from the state department I
am proud to say that two thirds of our
schools already have good ventilating
systems. Surely in the face of these
figures, the other one third will not
postpone their action.
In Cheboygan county a few years ago
a tesf was made of the vision of coun
try school children. The test showed
that 51 per cent of the pupils had de
fective vision in one form or another.
Causes are much the same in Charle
voix county- one half enough light or
cross light for continuous straining of
the eyes thru a period of six consecu
tive hours.
When school houses were first built
these matters had not been investigat
ed. We cannot help the fact that our
school houses have been wrongly built.
Years have come and gone without our
knowledge of the steady advance of the
slow creeping disease in our midst.
Years have passed without our realiz
ing the dreadful consequences of in
jured eyesight but the results are
known now. In the face of these facts
a new era has dawned. Fathers and
mothers thruout the land are demand
ing that their school houses be re
modeled to meet the requirements of
health. The department has made a
careful study of conditions and has
published the manual of remodelling
old buildings. Besides this they will
be glad to answer any questions that
you wish to ask them at any time about
your buildings. At your invitation a
state inspector will come without any
expense to you to tell you just what
your building lacks.
If every school board in Charlevoix
county should this year vote a tax of
$100 just for improvement and expend
it wisely. We could have 25 new
Standard Schools in 1916 instead of our
goal 15 new Standard Schools. All the
remaining schools could complete their
plans in one more year. Grand Tra
verse county already has as its slogan
"Every School a Standard School."
Shall we fall behind the mark? Get
the improvement germ and the money
will follow in its lead.
When your school has received its
Standard plate yours may be a school
about which your teacher may say
"Here our boys and girls may become
healthier and stronger, here their eyes
are relieved from the strain of continu
ous study, and their lungs may daily
and hourly expand with fresh pure air
As you gaze with pride at the plate
above your door, you may hear the
teacher of your boyhood days reading
to you "It was not the thing that you
did, my dear, but the thing that you
left undone that gave you the bit of a
heartache at the setting of the sun."
MAYL. STEWART,
Com'r of Schools.
ON THE FIRING LINE.
Washington became wildly excited
the other day over a report that Post
master General Burleson was to re
sign in order to try for the Senatorship
from Texas, Burleson promptly denied
the story. He may run for Senator,
but he certainly will not resign his pre
sent job. The precedents are all
against it. Franklin Roosevelt did not
resign as Assistant Secretary of the
Navy when he went into the Senatorial
primary in New York in 1914. The
motto of this administration, be it un
derstood, is "Safety first."
Business failures in 1915 v.cre about
4,000 more than in 1914, but the total
liabilities were about $50,000,000 less.
This means that big concerns, dealing
in war orders and otherwise benefited
by the champagne prosperity of the
moment, managed to avoid receiver
ship while the smaller manufacturer
and the retailer, whose prosperity de
pends upon the orders which his
neighbors give him and upon their
ability to pay for what they buy, had to
go under. The "prosperity" of the
country is, as Congressman Ilumporey
says, "local, spotted, temporary, spas
modic." The latest issue of the Federal Re
serve Bulletin, organ of the Federal
Reserve Banking system, runs true to
form in that it shows about GO per cent
of all the rediscount business for No
vember to have been done in those
favored centers, Richmond, Atlanta
and Dallas. The same issue also con
tains a notice of an assessment upon
the member banks to pay the cost of
operating the system. Are Richmond,
Atlanta, and Dallas to pay GO per cent
of this assessment? Nay, nay, Pauline.
All the member banks, everywhere,
will pay their little one-tenth of one
per cent on their stock in the Reserve
Bank to pay the cost of maintaining an
institution which chiefly benefits Rich
mond, Atlanta and Dallas. Is the
South in the saddle?
Congressman Hilliard, (Dem.) of
Colorado probably spoke the truth
when he declared that no member of
the House would, of his own volition,
have offered the resolution for the con
tinuance of the "war tax." And yet
all the Democratic members voted for
the low tariff bill which made the "war
tax" necessary. How can Hilliard now
escape responsibility?
The report of the General Board of
the Navy was in such demand that the
supply was exhausted within ten days.
That is the report Secretary Daniels
tried to suppress. If Mr. Daniels could
write a report that would be in such
great demand he would be in better
standing before the country than he is
today. Senator Lodge has had the
General Board's report printed as
Senate Document 231.
President Wilson has announced his
support of a policy of guaranteeing
each of the American Republics terri
torial integrity and protection against
sales of munitions to revolutionists.
Judging by his past record, we may
expect a directly opposite announce
ment a few months hence.
Now that the annual estimates for ap
propriations have been submitted to
Congress and the totals published by
the newspapers, the Departments are
quietly slipping in supplementary es
timates for new or increased or em
ergency appropriations. But some one
will take the trouble some day to make
a new total and ascertain exactly how
much this "economy" administration
has really asked for.

It is probably a mistake to say we do

The fellow who tells that he is so
much smarter than other people is dif

fact that the rest of us keep that part

A well known professor is given cre

There are those who profess con

we venture the prediction that fear of
public opinion keeps more men in the
straight and narrow path than fear of
the law.
County Normal Notes.
Ethel Barbour, Frances Price, Hazel
Richardson and Florence Maddaugh
begun their practice teaching in the
training room, last Thursday. They
observed the first three days of last
week. Ethel Barbour and Frances
Price have charge of the third grade
reading, Florence Maddaugh of the
sixth grade reading, and Hazel Rich
ardson of one of the classes of the
chart pupils.
The class has made some paper fur
niture and some paper cuttings for
manual training.
There has been an exhibit from the
Grand Rapids schools placed in the
Normal room. The exhibit is very
neatly arranged and very good work is
shown. The children of the grades of
the Charlevoix schools have been in to
look at the work. They were especial
ly interested in the manual training
work.
Hazel Richardson and Sadie Blan-ch-.rd
were absent on account of 111
ivwss last week.
Marcia Goss taught English in the
High school during the absence of
Miss Northrop, last week.
An Electric Restaurant.
A large mining company has install
ed an electric restaurant 150 yards in
from the foot of the shaft in one of its
mines. Here food is cooked or heated
electrically and hot coffee is prepared
by the same means. Since most of the
important coal mines already use
electric power under-ground for power
purposes, there should be little diffi
culty in establishing subteranean elec
tric restaurants in any of them.
