Unqualified Approval of

COMPULSION FAVORED
Speaking Before Security
League Stimson Shows
Contempt of "Subs."
Washington, Jan. 22. Unqualified
endorsement of the administration's
coatlnental army plan was given today
if Henry L. Stimson, secretary of war
in the Taft administration In an ad
dress before the National Security
league.
Decluring himself in favor of com
pulsory universal military service as
th true solution of the defense prob
lem, Mr. Stimson said he regarded the
program now advanced by Secretary
Garrison as the sound initial step.
"If congress is not ready to sanction
wuversal training," he said, "the meas
ures which are enacted should be those
which, so far, as they go, are in ac
cord with this great fundamental duty
ind which will lead most naturally to
the establishment of such a system.
"Instead of ourselves performing the
most vital duty of citizenship," said
Mr. Stimson, "we have been hiring oth
er men to do it for us. Other democ
racies have been more insistent and
intelligent and today are reaping the
advantage of their action, not only in
their national security but in the sta
bility of character which their train
tag has given to the individual.
Disapproves Paying Militia.
"One of the propositions which is be
ing seriously urged before congress
Is that we should pay our state militia
from the national treasury and should
attempt to develop them into our fed
eral citizens' army while they still re
tain their legal character as a state
force. Four years ago, when it was
dear that no other force of federal re
serves could be obtained from con
gress, I reluctantly gave my approval
t?'a pay bill in order to obtain the ad
vantages of training and discipline
lrhlch the measure provided. Further
study of the subject and of the situa
tion evoked by the war have made It
dear to me that such legislation would
be a mistake.
"Under the federal legislation the
organized militia is primarily a state
force instead of a national reseerve and
I do not believe that any effective citi
was' army can be created out of a
force dominated by 4S separate sover
eignties. For nearly 15 years efforts
have been mau by the federal govern
ment, as well as by the state authori
ties, to increase the number of the
Hard, yet it has remained nearly sta
tionary. The national guard is in fact a state
military force which we are also re
Wring to do duty for the national gov
ernment. "So long as such forces exist the
Kates are tempted to slur their police
iaties and to rely wholly on citizen
oldiery for that purpose.
Beirard Soldiers In Wrong Light.
"What is even worse, there has grad

ONE KILLED AND
AN0THER1NJURE0
BY BOLD BANDIT
Chicago, 111., Jan. 22. Detectives
scoured Chicago today for a man,
wearing a closely crftnpfcd mustache,
who "yesterday shot a policeman to
death, wounded another man and
escaped with $1,000 from the Chicago
branch of the Thomas Cook and Sons
tourist agency.
The robbery occurred in the very
heart of Chicago, at State street and
Jackson boulevard, during the late aft
ernoon, "rush hour." The streets were
crowded with automobiles and work
ers. The bandit instantly killed Traffic
Policeman Bror A. Johnson and
wounded Ernest Walsh, cashier for the
Cook agency. He escaped, assisted by
the woman who accompanied him aft
er a tazlcab driver refused to assist In
the flight.
There Is no clue to the whereabouts
of the bandit. The woman, however, is
believed to have boarded a train for
Toledo shortly after the robbery. She
Is believed to have left the train at
some Intermediate point, however,
since the Toledo police reported that
no woman answering the description
was on board the train when it reached
there.
Descriptions of the man were vague
and agree on virtually one detail. The
witnesses were certain that the bandit
wore a mustache of a style made pop
ular by a motion picture comedian.
Other points in the description led to
a statement by Nicholas Hunt, chief of
the detective bureau that his men were
searching for William La Trasse, who
escaped from the Kansas City peni
tentiary in 1913.
Rewards have ben offered for cap
ture and conviction of the murderer.
According to stories told by the wit
nesses, the bandit entered the office of
the agency, which is located on Jack
son street near State, one of the busi
est factions In the downtown district,
shortly before five o'clock. At the
point of a revolver he drove the em
ployes into a vault, clos -.i ihe door
and turned the combinin g, locking
them in. When Walsh, ti i : ujhier, at
tempted to resist, the bai.dit fired, in
flicting a slight flesh wound.
After locking up the clerks the
bandit took all the money In sight in
the cashier's cage and left the agency.
At the door he' met Policeman John
son and shot him dead. Outside the
woman waited In a taxicab. The bandit
leaped In, pointed the revolver at the
chauffeur, but he refused to start the
machine. Then both the man and
woman fled down an alley.

Give Back to
Belgium All
It Had; Pope
Washington, Jan. 22. The British
embassy today issued this statement,
based on its dispatches from London:
"A-dlstinguished Belgian Jesuit, Fa
ther Denusse, lately received by the
holy father, has given the following ac
count of the audience to a Dutch chap
plain in the Belgian army on his re
turn: " 'The pope told me to repeat it
along the trenches to men and to offi
cers and even to the king himself, that
he considers Belgium has the right to
complete reparation from Germany
and that he will never consent to of
fer his good offices for reestablishment
of peace unless Belgium has all her
territories in Europe and Africa re
stored her with plenitudes, her liber
ties and her international rights as
they existed before, and this without
prejudice to her claim for an adequate
indemnity to be fixed after an inven
tory of all public monuments destroy
ed after rebuilding factories and pri
vate houses and restitution of all pri
vate property.' "
WOULD EXCLUDE
ORIENTAL RACES
Washingon, Jan. 22. A provision to
exclude Hindus as well as Chinese
and restrict Japanese immigration
has been included in the Burnett im
migration bill, which Is to be report
ed to the house next week by the im
migration committee. The provision,
the culmination of efforts by the Pa
cific coast members, proposes the ex
clusion of "the brown and yellow
races, with certain passport excep
tions." This action, to which the committee
pledged to secrecy until the bill
emerges from committee, became
known today.
THE WAR TODAY
The Balkans continue to take
precedence in the war news, both
Montenegro and Greece being
points of notable Interest.
Further reports regarding the
resumption of hostilities between
Montenegro and Austria, following
a rejection of peace terms by the
former, arc lacking, and there is
small disposition in Teutonic quar
ters even to admit that there has
been cny break In the negotiations.
A Berlin dispatch today, however,
quoted a Cologne newspaper as
conceding that obstacles hud aris
en during the negotiations and
that there had been a refusal of a
part of the Montenegrin army to
lay down Its arms.
Dispatches from Petrograd
claimed further successes for the
Bnssians against the Turks in the
Caucasus campaign.
There is discussion in Germany
of a separate peace between tier
many and Belgium, and a London
dispatch quotes an influential
Frankfurt newspaper as suggest
ing that Belgium ouitht not to wait
too long before taking up the sub-JecU
FLOODS RECEDE
AS RAINS CEASE
IN MIDDLEWEST
Chicago, Jan. 22. A cold wave, said
by the weather bureau to be sweeping
eastwafiT from the Rocky Mountain
regions, was held out today to bring
relief from the flood conditions which
prevailed in northern Illinois yester
day. The heavy rains, which caused
rivers and streams to overflow, had
stopped, according to early reports.
With thousands of persons tempor.
arily made homeless, property loss in
to hundreds of thousands of dollars,
railroad traffic interrupted and several
cities facing a possibility of epidemic
as the result of pollution of their
drinking water by the flood, the reced
ing waters were watched with consid
erable anxiety.
Belated reports reaching Chicago
told of extensive havoc wrought in city
and countryside within a radius of 50
miles. Hundreds of farms in the Fox,
DesPlaines, Rock and other rivers
valleys are being maintained at bridges
to spread the alarm should they be
swept away.
Joliet, Aurora and Elgin suffered
most from the floods. Streets and
basements were flooded, much low
land inundated and residents driven
from their homes, while in a few cases
the houses were floated off their foun
dations. At all three points dynamite
was used to break ice jams which held
the water in check.
In Chicago sewers backed up and
hundreds of basements were flooded,
telephone service suffered when the
conduit tunnels were filled with wa
ter and subways under railroad via
ducts were flooded to the extent that
traffic through them was impossible.
Firement were kept busy all day
pumping out flooded basements.
City health officers warned residents
to boil all drinking water to avoid the
possibility of a typhoid epidemic.
A list of cities where flood damage
was done included Ottawa, La Salle,
Rockford, Peoria, Streator and Free
port, 111., besides many smaller cities,
suburbs of Chicago. Advices from out
side the state reported flood conditions
at Kansas City, Mo., Oklahoma City
and other nearer points.
Banks Make Increase.
New York, Jan. 22. The statement
of the actual condition of clearing
house banks for the week show that
they hold $180,914,610 reserve in ex
cess of legal requirements. This is an
Increase of $8,396,240 over last week.

1 Paso, Texas, Jan. 22. Cus
toms officers early today opened
fire on several Mexicans attempt
ing to cross the international bor
der with large bundles of rags.
The Mexicans fled. It is not be
lieved any were injured.
Ysleta, Texas, Jan. 22. Five Mexi
cans, members of a band of Mexican
cattle and horse thieves, shot and in
stantly killed Bert Akers, a young
rancher of this place yesterday after
noon, according to the story told of
the tragedy today by Douglas Downs,
Akers' companion, who survived a hail
of bullets as he and Akers, riding one
horse, sought to escape. They were
unharmed.
Juan Barrios, a Mexican secret
service man detailed to aid the young
American in the search for six cows
stolen from Mrs. J. D. Murphy, Akers'
sister-in-law, was relieved of his
weapons by the Mexicans but not
harmed. Akers was 25 years old and
leaves a widow and three children.
Texas rangers spent last night ly
ing out on the border searching for
the Mexicans involved in the killing.
Reports from Juarez had stated that
only two of the Mexicans out of the
five who killed the Americans hail
been caught by Mexican soldiers. The
Duran brothers lived here for some
time after coming from New Mexico.
Stories Conflicting.
Downs' story contradicts the story
the Mexicans told to General Gavira,
commandant at Juarez, that the Amer
icans and the Mexican secret service
I officer fired at them.
"We have been going into Mexico
every day since last Sunday, in search
of the cows taken from Mrs. Murphy's
ranch," said Downs. "We went over
across the river into Mexico yesterday
morning and came across a dairyman
who gave us the first clew as to the
whereabouts of the cows.
"Juan Barrios of El Paso, a Mexican
detective, was the only one of us
armed.
"We rode up to the house and Akers
went to the corral to see if the Murphy
cows were there. The ears had been
cut off and they had been re-branded to
disguise them.
Were Familiar Friends.
"Frederico Duran came out and hailed
! Akers, saying 'Hello Chappo,' which is
a nickname of Akers. He knew us at
once as shown by this salute and con
trary to the statements they made to
the commandant at Juarez in which
they claim they did not know either of
us were Americans.
"Frederico asked what we wanted
and Akers answered that he wanted to
look at the stock in the corral. Fred
erico said he would have to see his
brother Bernardo and turned back into
the house.
"I was riding up and down on my
horse at the side of the house while
Bert had dismounted near the corral.
I then noticed four men in the house.
I told Akers that I thought Barrios had
better not try to arrest any one. Just
then all the Mexicans came running
out of the house and four of them ran
up a ladder to the roof. Each had a
six shooter. They started to shoot at
us and they kept popping at Akers and
me.
Slain Man Had Dismounted.
"Akers had got off his horse and
consequently had little opportunity to
get away. I cut across a field on my

New York yesterday, pleaded not guilty
today on the charge of murder In con
nection with the death of Dolores
Evens, 18 years old, who was stran
gled to death in a hotel here two weeks

Miner's Life
Savedby His
TrueFriends
Tacoma, Wash., Jan. 22. The story
of how the life of Robert Nelson, a
miner, was saved by four men who
harnessed themselves to a sled and
dragged him for two days over snow 12
feet deep, was received today from Cle
Elum.
Nelson working in a mine S . the
mountains, injured his leg so severely
that an amputation was necessary. The
nearest hospital was at Cle Clum, 28

companions, going two days without
food, pulled the patient on a sled to
the hospital where his leg was ampu
tated. His recovery Is expected.

er part of It has already been reduced
to ashes and it is threatened with
destruction in its entirety. Nearly

AUSTRIA ADMITS
-PEACE TROUBLES
Berlin, Jan. 22. "The Austria-Hun
garian official press bureau," says the
Overseas News agency, "announces
that the laying down of arms as agreed
on by the Montenegrin government is
meeting with difficulties and that the
general disarming of he Montenegrins
will be delayed, this being principally
due to the long distance over which
the soldiers have to travel and to the
bad communications.
"The press bureau also declares that
the delay is due in part to the national
peculiarities of the Montenegrin peo-
!ple, who, ignoring the general situa
tion, do not know whether they are ex
pected by their government to con
tinue the war on their own account.
"The Austria-Hungarian govern
ment," the press bureau adds, "appre
ciating these circumstances, has
granted time to the Montenegrin gov
ernment so that it may get into com
munication with the reluctant part of
the population in order to appease it
and bring about a systematic submis-
REBELS DEFEAT
REGULAR TROOPS
Peking, Jan. 22. The rebels in the

body of government troops and are
moving northward.
The engagement between the revo
lutionists and the government forces
took place at Suifu Eze-Chuen prov
ince, the rebels having crossed the
northern border of Yun Nan. The force
opposing them at Suifu was the gar
rison of that place, and after defeat
ing it the rebels marched northward
toward Tzeliu Tsing, apparently with
the intention of moving on to Cheng
Tu, the capital of Sze-Chuen province.
Many government troops from Han
kow were arriving at Chung King, on
the Yang Tse Kiang, In Sze-Chuen
