Individually, "and op behalf of the

1 wish to voice the intense feeling ot
sorrow caused the members of our
body upon receiving the telegraphic
account of the catastrophe.
rit Is with extreme regret we Jearn
of the apparent heavy damage to
property, but, above all, we -wish to
V' tender ourmoat sincere sympathies to
? the people of Maul who are suffering
by the tudden taking away of loved
members of their families during the

their property, 'Lahaina Is rapidly re:
covering from the effects of the Sun
day, to Thursday kona gale, according
to officers of the Inter-Island steamer
Mauna Kea, which arrived at 6:15 this
" morning from Hlld. Mahukona and La
haina. No lives were lost or houses wash-
':" ed a way at Lahaina. the ship's offi-
iters reported, and the only damage
to shipping there waa the destruction
' of two, Japanese fishing sampans. All
'the small fishing and, pleasure craft
. ' were hauled uj for safety, to Lahalna's
main business utreet, which parallels
the wharf and beach." Of the two
wrecked sampans, the engine was
saved from one, and the other was
' hauled up on the beach, but not until
it had been badly battered and prac
tically wrecked.
v "Lahaina people think the road to
- Walluku "will be open again by Mon
. day or Tuesday," said Freight Clerk
. E. Thompson today. "The telephone
company's repair, gang Is hard at
; , work and expects to have 'phone serv
ivef resumed tomorrow or Monday.
Power Wires Went First.
"I went ashore at Lahaina and
learned that the kona gale and flood
made- a - lot of trouble there. The
-wires of the electric lighting and pow
. er system blew down first, then came
the flood and inundated the generat
ing plant .With iro electricity, the
. radio station at Lahaina went out of
business,, and. when it got its emerg
.eacy, power plant to working found
there was no water In the city mains
to feed its boilers because the city
- water pumping station had been flood
ed, stopping the pumps.
"George. Dunn. Inter-Island agent
there, told me there were three Inches
of mud all over his office floor and
the same, condition existed In many
other parts of the town. The water
-has all gone down by this time,
though, and things are being cleaned
up. The wind uprooted a fine, 6tately
old tree near Dr. Burt's place. It was
between 45 and 50 years old."
Purser P. T. Phillips said the Mauna
Kea had 1 no trouble landing . passen
. gera and freight at Lahaina on both
. the outward and Inward trips He
added that the weather homeward
was delightful, with light variable
winds along the Hawaii coast and
smooth seas. ' , ".- .
Smooth Seas In Channels.
There was a light swell at the
landings," he said, "but not sufficient
to stop work. Crossing the channels
we had .moderate westerly "winds,
smooth seas and a cleir night"
No passengers from the storm-ravaged
town of Walluku were taken
aboard at Lahaina, because they could
not get to Lahaina as the road is out
of commission from washouts. A tem
porary road may be open by the fore

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 22. Secretary Garrisons plans for
a continental army, as indorsetl by the president and to be urged by
Mr. Wilson on his forthcoming speaking tour, were given unqualified
indorsement today by Ex-Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.
Mr. StimsonV emphatic indorsement came in the course of au
address before the National Security League which is in session here.
He declared also that compulsory military service is the true solution
of the defense problem.
Referring to the details of the Garrison program, he said that
they make up a sound initial step, indicating his belief that further
kteps will be necessary to provide the. ideal plan for meet jug the
problem of national defense. .
Senator Elihu Root of New York, who was unable personally to
be present, sent a letter in which he indorsed the "contention of Sec
retary Garrison that the National Guard does not furnish a depend
able medium for army increase to the extent proposed by the ex
perts.': :;''Y-'.;;.-;-: " r-:'i-i'- Y. v Y y
' Secretary Garrisons plan for a Continental Army is succinctly
set forth in a statement which has just reached Hawaii from Wash
ington. This statement was made by Mr. Garrison before the House
committee on military affairs' on January 6. The gist of it is in the
following paragraph: ' ' '
'It is proposed to raise 400,000 men; embracing the various arms
of the service, , in annual increments of 133,000 each. The country
would be dividedup into districts and each district would b called
upon for its proportionate quota. If "the 40O congressional districts
are taken as a basis, 333 men would be required annually from each
suck district. The men would enlist for three Vears with the eolors
and three years on furlough. During thetitneof their fryic-e with
jbfeVcottrsti training, ' They
would-be armed, equipped and officered.- Their training would be
donV by the officers ; and- men of the ' Regular Army, organizations,
units of which similar to . those to be trained being sent to work
with each such unit. They would be paid during the time of their
service on the same basis' as the Regular Army' is paid. At first
officerewould be secured from those who'have served in the Regular
Army or the National Guard, from the officers on the reserve list of
the Army, from graduates of military schools and colleges who
qualify, and from .the ranks of the force itself. : Later it is hoped
that we can obtain large numbers of proper material from the many
schools and colleges throughout the country that either have or wifl
include proper military, courses, standardized under regulations o
theVWar Department, and over which courses and training the War
Department will - have sufficient supervision and participation to
keep informed of the, results and to be able to select the best mate
riaL Thousands of young men will be graduated from these institu
tions each year after we have got the system in complete operation.
They will, furnish as fine material as any foreign army ever, had tot
this purpose.' ' y r . ' v 1
