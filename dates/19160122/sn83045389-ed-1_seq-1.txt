WASHINGTON. I> January 21.?
I tenth tn Americans In Mexico anil de
struction of their property. as well as
j wiir to a Iinisli against Carranza. was
'
; determined upon, it became known bore
to-night, at a formal convention of
Mexican revolutionary leaders hold In
November at a innch near Cordoba.
I'rcscnt and joining in the agreement
are said to have been representatives
of Villa, Xaputa. Arguniemlo. lligietiio
Au uilar, the Codillo brothers, and
j inany less chiefta ins.
Meager reports of this gathering
came to tile State Depi-rt uient long ago.
but they were not made public, and
| until to-night few people in Washing
; ton knew thai there was a general
j conspiracy against Americans', or even
tiiiit the various rebel factions in the
liebl in Mexico had effe.cted any kind
, of a campaign for concentrated activi
ties against lite de. facto government.
The recent massacre at Santa Vsabel,
' attributed to bandits, leil by Villa of
ficers. is believed to have l>eoii perpe
' (rated hi accordance with the conven
tion order. Mlllcials think the long
period which elapsed after the Cordoba
meeting before "ho murders was be
cause of 'lie time required b> the vari
ous delegates to make reports to their
commanders, and the fact that news of
the convention's decision hail to be car
, ried to subordinate military com
! inandei's by courier. Cordoba is on the
railroad between V??ra Cruz. and Mexico
j i 'it y. and some 1,000 miles from Santa
Ysabel.
('A Itlt A V/.A A I TIIOHI'MKS
KIOPT Kt I.I, \ A I) V IS1CI)
The I'arrauza authorities have been
fully advised concerning llie inoveiucnts
ol the rebels, and have been depended
, upon by th- Washington government
to take every possible precaution to
! prevent the thrcits against Americans
j from being carried out. They are be
lieved to have the s'.tuatii n fairly well
in liaml now, although the chiefs whose
delegates met at Cordoba still are in
the liebl operating r. ore or 1 *ss openly.
Soon after Carranza was recognized
! the State I iepa rt ment withdrew its
I consul olllcers from Northern Mexico,
1 ami reiterated its warning to Ameri
. cans to leave. tiniy by Retting citizens
of the I'nJted States a\va.? from terri
tory not fully controlled by the de
1 facto governnii lit. it was realized,
eon Id there be any real assurance of
safety.
1*Yw details of the Cordoba conven
lioit ar< known, but. according to the
reports, it lasted t'oi several days, a tut
some of the earlier arrivals waited
probably week- for all the delegates to
appear. Appaicntly the call for the
meeting was sent out as soon as it
kecamc certaiii i lie I'tiited States was
< about to recognize, I'arranza, although
? t vviis a mouth alter recognition ac
tual I.v had been accorded before tho
delegates got together. At that time
larn- forces of Villa and Zapata forces
were, operating ;ii the neighborhood of
lite railroads near Mexico ('ity, and it
was posrlSile for the convention to
assi fihle ami do its work with com
parative .iil'etv from interruption.
