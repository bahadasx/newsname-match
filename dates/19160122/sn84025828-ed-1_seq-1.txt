PITY 2 ORPHANS
Intense Grief Felt in Democratic Circles
Over the Cruel Treatment of Dolly

The Battle for Delegates. Committeeships and Other
Big Plums Taking Up Attention of
Local Statesmen.
Wet and Dry Question Will Gut a Big Figure in Next
Year's Battle Throughout the State
of Illinois.
Factions in Both the Big Parties Are Making a Hard Fight for
the Control of the Managing Committees.
It was not nlono an Indignation
meeting.
They had a political Fox Trot at tho
Morrison on Sunday.
It was participated In by 101 mem
bers of the Harrison Vereln.
Dolly Sabath led tho chase.
Cato Harrison bobbed along after
him.
Both were red-hot in pursuit of Sul
livan, who had ignored these Two
Orphans.
There was a loud demand for that
Society fashion plate, Ham Lewis, to
execute his renowned Side Step.
But the noblo senator, it was an
nounced, was on
Two programs,
And evidently thought It best not to
show up.
Dolly Sabath almost blew out a
tooth denouncing the latest Sullivan
raid on the "rlghtB of tho people."
Cato Harrison funned the flame.
Mlko Zlmmer was notable for his
absence from the Set.
Sullivan woh pilloried as a Sabath
breaker by friends of Congressman
Sabath.
Incensed by the action of the Sullivan-controlled
Democratic state cen
tral committee In naming a "harmony"
slate of eight candidates for delegates
at large without Including the name
of former Mayor Harrison, the Harrison-Dunne
forces decided definitely
to put up a complete opposition slate.
More than 100 Harrison-Dunne Dem
ocrats, Including former Mayor Harri
son, State's Attorney Hoyne, Sheriff
Traeger, President Ileinberg of the
county board and Congressman Sa
bath, and United States Marshal
Bradley and Collector of Internal
Revenue Smletanka, Dunno lieuten
ants, were In attendance. Thirty-two
of tho thirty-five wards wero repre
sented. ROOSEVELT HAS THEM
The Former President Backed by

Forces Controls Illinois
Republicans.
Roosevelt and Doneon are going to
pool their Issues in Illinois.
This means that Roosevelt will havo
tho fifty-eight delegates from Illinois
in tho Republican National Conven
tion for President.
It also means that Deneen will havo
the solid Progressiva support for the
Deneen candidates for stato and
county oltlces.
You can bet on this,
The information Is authentic and

DRYS ARE WARNED
Told by Attorney for Election
Board They Are Treading on
Dangerous Ground.
Following an opinion by Colin C. II.
Fyffe, attorney for the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners, warning circu
lators of tho "dry"petttlon that they
aro guilty of perjury If they are un
able to vouch for tho genuineness of
every signature on tholr petition
sheets, there came tho possibility that
tin petition may not be filed
and that tho question of voting Chi
cago "dry" may, therefore, not be put
boforo the voters next spring.
Tho possibility of tho petition not
being fllod hinges on tho fact that
George F. Rlnehart, who camo to Chi
cago from Arizona to luko charge of
tho petition work, is reported to havo
quit tho fight.
Mr. Fyffo's opinion was mado pub
lic by Dennis J. Egan, chlof clerk of
the Board of Election Commissioners,
after County Judge Thomas F. Scully
had entered a request for it. Curtis
Weber of 3628' North Hoisted street,
one of tho circulators of the dry peti
tions, had previously written a lotter
to Judge Scully asking If he, Weber,
would bo guilty of perjury If he could
not vouch for every signature on his
sheots.
TO IMPROVE SALOONS
Theodore Oehne, the Well
Known Retired Brewer, and
Others Testify Before Mu
nicipal Commission.
Two saloonkeopors and a retired
brewer gave tho municipal commis
sion on tho liquor tralllc somothing
to think about.
They appeared as witnesses at the
request of the commission, and among
tho points they mado In their testi
mony wero these:
Cabarets in connection witli saloons
should bo abolished.
Ton per cent of Chicago's saloons
are lawless.
About 2,000 saloonkeepers are los
ing money every day.
Saloons that aro "hangouts" for
criminals should be closed and kept
closed.
Breweries own at least 3,000 of tho
city's licenses.
Saloonkeepers owning their own
places aro not treated so well as
aaloonkeepers whose places are owned
by breweries.
Policemen should inspect saloons
regularly.
Bartenders should be licensed.
Saloonkeepers conducting objection
able places do so "under concessions,"
"Most of our saloons aro well reg
ulated, but still certain' features should
bo eliminated," said Theodore Oehne,
a retired brewer. "The city has pow
er to make these eliminations. In my
Judgment about 10 per cent of our
saloons are objectionable,
Cabarets should not be permitted in
connection with saloons. Tho expenses
of a good, legltlmato cabaret run high,
nnd tho shows require a good deal of
floor space, so that In many Instances
you find bad shows .In places whero
they haven't suillclent room to givo a
legltlmato show.
"By all means gambling should not
be permitted in saloons. It should bo
stamped out. I don't mean n game of
cards for a glass of beer or tho like,
as I don't consider that gambling. I
mean betting on tho horse races, poker
and such games.
"Saloons that cater to criminals
should be closed and they should bo
kept closed. I don't consider that
ownership of licenses by breweries Is
a bad thing, for tho breweries exer
clso care in selecting tho men they
put In charge of saloons. But the in
dividual owner doesn't worry about
the character of tho man to whom he
transfers a license."
CAN SUCH THING BE?
Health Department Said to Be
Lacking in Men Who Can Tell
Germs from Icicles.
"Personally, I believe John Dill Rob
ertson would hardly know tho differ
ence between a staphlococcus nnd an
elephant."
With the foregoing commpnt, Dr
Charles E. W. Fischer, who has been
denouncing Ileulth Commissioner Rob
ertson's cold car crusade, declined
Dr. Robertson's Invitation to aid him
in making examinations in tho pres
ent grip epidemic.
After declining to join forces with
Dr. Robortson, Dr. Fischor said:
"I agreo with Dr. Robertson that it
would bo greatly desirable to have
some expert assistance In tho health
department. That tho imalth depart
ment has not such Is not Dr.t Robert
sou's fault. Tho health department
does not get sulllclont appropriation
to hire exports,
"Tho olllco of health commissioner
is acquired through politics, and not
becauso tho incumbent Is expert upon
health matters.
"I suggest that Dr. Robertson take
a couplo of days off and learn some
thing of modern Ideas regarding pure
air before ho attempts to force more
of his 'draft' cars on Chicago."
FIRE DRILLS
KNOCKED OUT
Corporation Counsel Holds That
There Is no Law Compelling
Employers to Hold Them.
Corporation Counsel Ettelson gave
an opinion that the city had no legal
right to pass an ordinance compelling
employers to hold Are drills to teach
their employes how to get out of burn
ing buildings. The opinion was asked
for by the Are prevention bureau of
the Are department. Mr. Ettelson
said that until the city got an en
abling act from the legislature it could
not compel Are drills by ordinance.

Civil Service Law as Some
thing Truly Terrible.
From last Sunday' Kxnmluer:

in the service of tho city for thirty
years to make room for u poor wid
ow," ho said at tho Irish Fellowship
club luncheon yesterday. "Hut tho

law Is a terrible thing.
"If three or four aldermen wlui con
stitute the reform element are elim
inated, if attempts to bring tho pres
ent city administration Into disfavor
ure ended, and if the civil service law
Is repealed, Mayor Thompson will bit
free to give Chicago tho most elllciciit
government It has ever had," Mr. Fa
liorty continued.
"Tho members of the mayor's cnb
Inot," ho told the members of tho club,
of which he formerly wns president,
"are all friendly to eacli other. This
