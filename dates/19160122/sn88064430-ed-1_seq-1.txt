Wilmington. Ihel.- The ifi f expi,
, slon illn t .r days at thie lu i 'otit ,ow\
der plant .n this vi niitty' occurred i:.
ithe Ilagley yards on the out.l.irts :

up, and beyond destroying the huiilt
Ints and about a ton of p owder xi
oamage was done. No one ,as lt. S
the mill.
- The fourth explosion 'occurred 'i
the smokelless powdi r plant at ('ar
r ney's Point. N. J.. across the lsla-;t"ar'
- River from WVilmington. 'Thrt.tn
tons of powder went off without in.
juring any one.
There was a blast at ('arn-y's Point a
which killed thre' nmon. and an ex
plosion at the llagley yards and an
other one at ('arney's Point.
"Thel large numlber of explo<ions at fr
this time," said a representative of th"
company. "is undoub:,tdly dueli to the
fact that the comlpany'- force I 1 n'li
times as great as n.ion I'i' I-:Europiean
war blrok., out, and there, is so tmi-fr
Smore work to be done'. It is also a
fact that nearly all of the orders are i
Sliurried. and it is al<o true that some
