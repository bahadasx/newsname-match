Small Engagements in Russia, Artillery and Alining Opera
tions in France and Belgium, and Infantry Attacks in the
, Austro-Italian Theatre Are Reported No Details Have
Yet Come of Renewal of Conflict in Montenegro A
Rome Despatch Says Albanian Troops Have Arrived at
Scutari to Join the Montenegrin Forces.
The cessation toy reason of heavy
casualties of the Russian attacks
against the Austro-Hungarians near
the Bessarabiah frontier, the capture
by the Russians from the Turks of
the town of Sultanabad, Persia, and
the taking from the Germans by the
British of additional ," towns . in the
' Kameron district of Africa are the
principal features of the fighting as
contained in the latest official commu
nications. --.
. There also have been small engage
ments in Russia, around Pinsk -and in
- the region of Czartorysk, artillery and
mining operations along the front in
France and Belgium and a continua
. tion of the artillery duels and here
' and there infantry attacks, in the Aus

HARTFORD MAN TELLS - :. ; ;
i- . OF CONDITIONS IN BELGIUM,
S Praises the .Splendid ' Work-of the
Rockefeller: Foundation. .
Rotterdam, Jan. 21, 5.43 p. m. Rob
inson Smith of Hartford, Conn, has
" arrived here after . an extensive-' stay
in Belgium. Mr. " Smith reports that
everything is quiet in the occupied
rone and that the work of feeding the
.' - ' civilian population is proceeding
- smoothly, except for a shortage of. food
in several provinces, which is due to
lack of shipping facilities and internal
transports. . -
-'Frederick C: WalcottEuropean rep
resentative of the Rockefeller founda
tion," said Mr. Smith, "has completed
on behalf of the- foundation an investi
gation of the work of the Belgian relief
commission directed by Herbert Ct
Hoover. The foundation is interested
in the work as one of the chief con
tributors to the commission, having
given it a million dollars' worth of
food at its inception and $200,000 late
ly for the supply of clothing for desti
tute Belgians.
"Mr. Walcott expressed himself as
not only satisfied but enthusiastic over
the splendid work of the organization
and the results it has achieved. He
said it was correct to say there is no
erious want in Belgium, yet such a
statement must. be coupled with the
reservation that this fact was due to
the work of the commission, and that
tven a momentary suspension of its
activities would lead to terrible dis
tress and misery within thirty days.
"Mr, Walcott reports that the com
mission deserves continued support in
Its struggle against a multitude of
lifflculties in maintaining its service
pf feeding 9,000,000 people. He salt
that, nnlike other relief organizations,
which do not traverse belligerent lines,
the commission baa earned the un
(ualmed confidence of all the fighting
rovernments, which not only enables
It to be of help to Belgium and north -rn
France, but 'makes it the -logical
frganization for feeding the other dis
tressed populations of Europe.
"Accompanied by Caspar Whitney,
representing the commission In Bel
gium, Mr. Walcott left here this week
tor Poland, where he and Mr. Whitney
drill make Investigations of the Polish
feeds. When these are completed the
arty will go to Serbia with the same
purpose. These investigation are un
ler the approval of all the . govern
dents concerned.""
Mr. Smith concluded by saying that
inless there Is an immediate improve,
nent In the shipping situation there
nil be an extremely serious shortage

as incompetent the testimony of James

According to a conservative estimate the direct . annual United
States outlay for advertising amounts to something like 700 million
dollars a year. This means that those who are spending that money
- are rendering a service to themselves and at the same time aiding
the purchasing public and it must be recognized that inasmuch as
such large expenditures are made there are responses which make
it advisable that they should be continued for advertising is an in
tegral part of selling.
The businessman knows that he cannot deny himself the use of
printer's ink and keep in touch with the people who want to buy and
the consumers have learned that If they are to preserve their ability
to spend their money wisely they must keep in touch with the ad
vertisements, f
The paper which therefore renders the greatest service is the one
that thoroughly covers Its field and goes into the home. In this city

coln sent a letter today to Superin
tendent William Offley. head of the lo
cal bureau of investigation of the de
partment of justice. In this letter he
offered to surrender if he was promised
immunity. This was taken to mean
that he wanted a pledge from . the

wouldvnot be turned over to the British
authorities. Before his escape an order
was Issued for his extradition as a
forger, but Lincoln has always insisted
that the English government intended
to shoot him as a py. -
Harbored by "Group B."

federal agents believe arranged Lin
coln's escape and is now harboring
him, is a body which was formed in

prominently into public notice some
years ago when it went to the aid of
Jan Pouren, a Russian political exile,
whose - extradition was demanded - by
the Russian government on the ground
that he was a murderer. Pouren had
attempted to start a revolution in the
Baltic - provinces of Russia. - Colonel
Roosevelt was then in the White
House, and Group B succeeded in se
curing an order from him for Pouren's
release. . - ...

had learned that several members of
Group B had visited Lincoln When he
was confined in Raymond street jail in
Brooklyn. It was also recalled that

some of the group at the time of his
arrest. -
Stories that Lincoln had been asso
ciated with Paul Koenig, chief detective-
of the Hamburg -American line,
and others who have been Indicted for
their alleged parts In German con
spiracies in. this country, were denied
today by secret, service officials.
