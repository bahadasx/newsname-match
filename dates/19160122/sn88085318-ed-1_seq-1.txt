OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Roosevelt's clamor for greater
preparedness has been a most in
teresting matter, and his fear
that. Wilson will not prepare suf
ficiently has brought out state
ments that Roosevelt has always
wanted a greater measure of pre
paredness. Yet some unkind in
dividual has dug up the official
record of Roosevelt's reduction
of the regular army by 11,000
men while he was president. So
we wonder how much of Wilson's
program was really originated by
Roosevelt.
The San Foil Eagle, published
at Keller, thus bemoans the gen
erous publicity which Colville is
securing for itself by its activity:
"Many persons living in far dis
tant parts of the country, assume
that because a town is named Col
ville, it must necessarily be lo
cated on the Colville, reservation.
We receive letters asking ques
tions about the town of Colville,
the writer taking it for granted
that Colville is somewhere on tiiis
reservation. We beg to inform
our far away readers that the
town of Colville is the county seat
of Stevens county and no part of
that county is on this reservation.
Colville is about seventy-five miles
northeast of Keller, and judging
from reports, it is a volcanic
crater of hot air in full eruption
over the opening of this reserva
tion. To heed much that is said
in that far off town one would
almost believe that Colville owns
this reservation and all who are
upon it. Even Clair Hunt, it is
said, is inviting all the homeseek
ers to come to Colville and follow
him over here into the promised
land and stand with him where
Moses stood when he viewed the
landscape o'er."
It was to have been expected
that the Examiner editor's ab
sence from town for a week would
upset general matters in this vi
cinity, but there was no intimation
of the serious aspect of the state
road situation which seemed to
develop while the editor was
drinking sweet cider in the former
booze emporiums of the Sound
metropolis. It seems that the
.Marcus and North port papers
have discovered a conspiracy on
the part of Colville to move the
state road and have it pass by in
stead of through that great rail
road center of Marcus. Just who
has moved the road, or who con
stitutes the Colville that did the
act, has not been disclosed by
Marcus or Northport newspapers,
and investigation hereabouts fails
to disclose the culprit.
So far as any information can
be obtained, the road from Col
ville north is not established, has
not been established, and will not
be established for some years, and
we see no likelihood of an appro
priation being made before March,
1919. We feel like going in with
Marcus and Northport in offering
a suitable reward for the appre
hension of any person or persons
who have been carelessly hand
ling this state road which as yet
is but in the minds of its desirous
possessors, and if Col vi lie is
guilty, we will take pleasure in
helping to locate that particular
part of Colville which may be
guilty.
A meeting of the democratic
state central committee is called
for Everett at 2 p. m. Feb. 5, to
make arrangements for selection
of delegates to the national con
vention at St. Louis, -June 14, and
to arrange for the selection of a
national eommitteeman, and for
the transaction of any other busi
ness. Not only the state com
mitteernen, but all interested
mem hers of the party, are re
quested to attend, as this will be
the opening of the 1910 cam
paign by the democrats.
The law of this state provides
the method of selecting delegates
to the state convention, and that
convention will undoubtedly se
lect the national delegates. The
selection of a national cominittee
man, however, is a matter of im
portance of which the party
should take due consideration.
In 1912 the state convention se
lected the committee-man, and the
unwise choice made at that time
has clearly demonstrated that this
state should use the method which
is not only wisest but which is
used in other states—selection of
national committeemen by the na
tional delegates after the presi
dential nomination has been
made. Then the platform, all
party measures, and the party
nominees, are known. A man can
be selected who is in full accord
with the party leadership and
platform.
Tlow foolish it is to name a man
as national eommitteeman before
the national party policy is es
tablished, before the presidential
nomination is made, and before it
can possibly be known whether
the eommitteeman is the best man
to handle all conditions of the
campaign. Fairness not only to
the man but to the party would
demand that all conditions be
know before the selection is made.
Judge J. Stanley Webster, of
the Spokane superior bench for a
nnmber of years, it is announced,
will be a candidate at the coming
general election for a place upon
the supreme court bench of the
state. Judge Webster is espe
cially fitted for judicial work.
If a candidate for higher honors,
he has earned his spurs by meri
torious services at the bar of the
courts of the state of Washing
ton. He first began as a bumble
practitioner, he became a prose
cutor and his successes in this of
fice attracted state wide attention.
H.^.was appointed liy Gov Hay to
fill a vacancy on the superior
court bench, and the peo.ple of
Spokane county applauded by
electing him later by the highest
vote yet cast for a candidate on
the non-partisan judiciary ticket.
He has performed his duties fear
lessly and satisfactorily as a judge
of a trial court. A partisan in
politics among the people, he has
demonstrated that he can adorn
the bench as a non-partisan judge.
AT THE CAPITAL.
(By Congressman C. 0. Dill.)
Why is the preparedness .senti
ment on the wane among mem
bers of the House; and Senate, is
a common question among on
lookers here. The answer is
short. They have been hearing
from home. There is no doubt
about it.
Before Christinas many of the
members of both parties who fa
vored the President's program,
since Christmas are openly oppos
ing it. Why? They were home
for Christmas or received plenty
of mail on the subject. "I can't
vote for the big increases pro
posed for the army and navy be
cause of my constituents," is an
explanation for the change of
front.
In my own cas<.' I have not pre
viously sent out letters to learn
the sentiment, although I am be
ginning to do so now, and at
least 75 per cent of all those who
have written me on their own
initiative on this subject are op
posed to any big increase, Bui
there are many influences right
here in Washington that have de
stroyed much of itie sentiment for
preparedness. It has been stated
again and again by various mem
bers of lioth houses thai during
the t<'ii years preceding the Euro
pian war this government lias
spent more money for a navy than
\> as spent for tile same purpose'
by any Other nation in the world
except (ireat Britain. This has
raised the ugliest question yet
propounded to the preparedness
propagandist, namely: If our
navy is so worthless as the big
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
navy advocates say, what has
hcni done with all the money?
Another blighted influence on
the preparedneti movement has
been the proposal to raise all of
the extra money necessary by in
creasing the tax on bis incomes
and inheritancos and by laying
a henvy tax on* the manufacturers
of munitions. In other words,
let the wealthy and those who are
profiting by the war pay for the
proposed increased preparedness.
Many members who previously
opposed the idea of government
manufacture of ships and war
munitions, have been won over,
because of the activity of the rep
resentatives of big munition mak
ers in behalf of increased pre
paredness. To take the profit
out of war preparations is the
most fatal proposal to prepared
ness enthusiasts that any member
can make in a private conversa
tion with him.
Of course one never knows
when the curreni of opinion will
start the oilier way, but certainly
at tin's time the preparedness sen-,
timent flood has passed its high
water mark lure at the capitol
and is running Btrongly the other
way. This does not mean that
there will be no preparedness
provided for by congress, but
simply thai the hysteria period is
over and that probably only a
reasonably increased prepared
ness program will be adopted.
